There are 2 things that I want from a store………  “Good service to me means – does the store sell what I want to buy? If they sell it, is it in stock?”  I want to hear 2 yeses. If I hear a “NO” at any point, I am out of the shop. If I hear an unhappy groan between the first YES” and the second YES, I am out of the shop because I do not want to hear a sad story.

I lived in Grand Valley about 15 minutes upriver and would catch my own bait in the river up there. Plus there are several lakes that hold bass, pike etc in the area. The regulated Brown Trout section is only a tiny piece of a very large system. Saying that most of the river is non organic bait is akin to saying the Credit is mostly non organic bait due to the special regs section at the forks."

467400,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-18 01:15:00,932," Natural Sports is the store I won't walk into anymore.  They are far far far worse than Troutfitters was the other day.  They're rude and don't want to give you the time of day unless you're looking to drop SERIOUS cash.  The owner was extremely rude to his younger employees the first time I was in there.  The second time I bought some stuff and was literally grunted at as I was buying it (perhaps Ken passed that down to the new management - where can I learn to speak Gruntlish so I can understand these people?)  I went in a third time and was underimpressed with the service again.  Three strikes, they're out.  Better prices and service elsewhere.  I also just can't agree with their Grand River Bass Tournament.  They're clearly exploiting the watershed for profit.  I suspect this is a trend around there as well.  Just my three cents based on my three experiences.  I'm sure I'll give Troutfitters another chance one of these days.  I won't be too hasty in dismissing them completely BUT I'm certainly not rushing back."

The money raised goes to the Stanley Park Optimist club and the funds go the improving access for fishing to those in wheelchairs handicapped etc. Thats why there is all that new trail along the grand out near Victoria .

467514,rock34,2010-05-18 15:16:00,215,I was in the same boat with Troutfitters.  I was more then willing to give them my fly fishing related business and my first time in there I got treated like I was a 5 year old and that I should just give up fly fishing if I didnt know the answers to the 2 questions I had

467542,crappieperchhunter,2010-05-18 17:11:00,2582,Not quite sure what I find more unpleasant. The treatment you got your first visit...or the fact that after a first visit impression  someone goes to great lengths to slag a business on the internet.  Everyone has a bad day. Maybe a second visit would turn out much better....just sayin.
467553,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-18 20:11:00,932," Do you work there or something?  They deserve to be slagged on the internet.  They deserve to be slagged on the riverbank and wherever else fishing is discussed.  If the business cared about their reputation they would reflect that towards the people that construct the reputation for them.  It's a manner of common decency and the fact is, when you run a retail business you have to put bad days aside.  ""I was having a bad day"" doesn't wash.  Perhaps you failed to read the replies to the initial thread, but I said that I will go into Troutfitters again.  I, however, am not about to drive the 30 minutes anytime soon.  AND, if you find the topic so unpleasant you could have easily ignored it.  The topic title was very clear (it even states ""first impression"").  I'm surprised you could read the topic title from up on that high horse of yours anyways .... just sayin.  So, I guess the next thing to say about Troutfitters is:  www.ReelFlies.ca  Steve, who I've dealt with exactly once, is phenomenal at customer service, even over the internet and phone.  He understands the principles of being polite and helpful and how they relate to running a successful business.  Coincidentally, I can buy stuff from ReelFlies for about 70% lower than at Troutfitters."
467166,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-17 13:38:00,932,"Well Folks,  I hate to sound like the Grinch here, but it always ruffles me up a little bit when I walk into a tackle shop and have a bad experience.  I'll keep the vent to a minimum and try to keep the discussion unbiased.  It's frustrating that some of these smaller tackle shops can't seem to understand that a) they can't compete on prices with online stores or bigger shops and  that because of a) they need to elevate in other areas (such as customer service).  So, Sunday afternoon, My girlfriend and I are on our way back from a weekend BBQ and I convince her to do a little fishing.  Generally, I'm bushwhacking and pounding through remote areas and looking for Browns.  Sunday, I know I need to switch things up and do something a little more girlfriend-friendly or these impromptu fishing trips will be a thing of the past.  I decide we'll go to Belwood lake in Fergus for a few hours, take in some sun, and ride the wall with minnows and hope the get a pike or two (I haven't done this kind of fishing in 2+ years now).  I hear that the family that sold minnows there had a death in the family and no longer sell minnows out of their garage, and I hear troutfitters (somewhere I've been meaning to go since I bought my first fly rod earlier this year) is now selling minnows.  I go into Troutfitters and am impressed immediately about the appearance of the store - a true fly shack with a clean and classy look.  Sadly, I'm greeted (by presumably the owner) with some kind of a grunt that more resembles ogre than English and nothing more.  I ask for minnows, they say they have them, and I grab a $7 minnow bucket (I'm unprepared).  I make an odd inquiry if they have any rope or string I can buy because I'd like to tie my minnows off at the wall.  The owner rudely exclaims ""Rope?"".  The young guy working found some and gave it to me but the damage was done again.  I browse around for awhile as the minnows are being prepared as I am interested in new, expensive waders, and bulk flies that match the hatch on the grand.  I ask for assistance and receive none, and by this point I'm ready to take my fish and leave.  As I am waiting to pay, some friends of the staff and a member of the staff itself start grilling me on what I am fishing for.  They ask me what is open (like they don't know) and they try to make it sound like I'm bass-hunting because there ""aren't many pike"" in Belwood.  (http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cfm?Sec=27&Sub1=119&sub2=0#fishing)  At that point they try to tell me that it is a pickeral lake primarily and that bass don't open until June 25th.  I've reached just about my boiling point, so I grab my crap and leave.  I get to the lake and the overpriced, under-quality minnow bucket doesn't close properly and is close to a write off for Sunday afternoon at least.  They probably thought I was just some fishing scrub, who fishes once or twice a year, and just tries to catch ""whatever.""  They probably weren't aware that I was someone just starting out my fly stock, who is almost addicted to tackle shops, and spends an unhealthy amount of money at said tackle shops.  They had an opportunity to win my fly-fishing based business (I am still pretty loyal to 2/3 shops in KW for general purchases) and they completely blew it.  Rude, Ignorant, Righteous, Bad-Business Minded.  Even if I was just the once or twice a year fisher, them of all people, should know how infectious fishing is, and they should be doing whatever they can to lock up long term customers.  Now all they got was bad word of mouth and this post here on an internet forum.  Feel free to share your experience.  Ryan"

They arent really that stuck up, or rude... but Im a younger guy and when I walk in there.... someone watches me LIKE A HAWK.... i cant just cruise the fishing section without being stared at the whole time ! They think im going to steal something ???? come on ! Also... Im in the market for a couple new combos.... one in particular I had in mmind was a Citica paired with a 7ft MH (prefferably shimano rod ) I walked in teh store saturday and low and behold... they have the EXACT combo im looking for ( I forgot to mention he has reels on the shelf from the 90's... brand new... asking list for... REALLY ??? ) He has the Convergence priced at $79.99...No big deal, I was told you can pick them up for $70 at some places..... now the reel... Brand new citica... $184.99 !!!!!!!!! INSANE !!!! So I asked if I could have the reel to try in on the rod and man it felt like an extension of my arm... light, small, PERFECT !!! I asked if he price matched and he said "" Well if your talkin about Cabelas or BPS then no we dont "" I said I can pick the rod up for $70 and the Reel for $129..... he laughed and said the best he could do was 10% off...... Really ???? I handed him the reel back and put the rod away and walked out."

467179,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-17 14:06:00,932," Funny enough you use that as your example.  I was shopping around Kitchener Waterloo for a Citica a few months ago before I decided to get into Fly-Fishing.  There is one store I won't even walk into, but the other two had it at 180.00 and 165.00.  They hadn't accounted for the CDN dollar going way up and were still charging with the exchange rate.  Both stores were willing to go down to about $140 and were great about the transaction (that never happened, but as I said, I did buy a fly setup).  Regardless, small tackle shop owners needs to wake up and realize that the consumers can go online and get just about anything cheaper & shipped.  They can't compete on prices, so at least they should have the decency to be friendly, or at the very least respect, their customer base."
467180,solopaddler,2010-05-17 14:13:00,8605," I didn't reply to the poll because only one of my criteria was there.  For me only 2 things matter : selection and price.  I could care less about customer service, friendliness or whatever.  (I should say if someone is blatantly unfriendly I won't shop there regardless of how good the store is. Case in point Grimsby Tackle which is just down the road from me)"
467183,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-17 14:19:00,932," I'll play Devil's advocate.  If you are concerned exclusively with selection and price, why not just shop for EVERYTHING online (save hardware).  Online (Ebay, BPS, Cabelas, Reelflies, etc) have FAR better prices than most tackle shops and have infinite selection due to no storage limitations.  I'll add selection to the poll.  Ryan"
467187,charlesn,2010-05-17 14:25:00,551,"What is wrong with our society that we only expect good, prompt, courteous service from ""smaller shops"" or places that can't compete on price...  I'm not that old - but I seem to (mis)remember a time when that kind of service was expected and anything outside of that was noteworthy.  Nowadays, I have to agree that I am pleasantly surprised any time I can go in to a shop of any kind and not be treated like an intruder.  Haven't been to that shop and don't plan on ever taking up fly fishing - but just wanted to make a comment that crappy service should not be tolerated from any size store or business.  I can walk in to a big box like Rona/HD/Lowes and have 2-3 people walk up and ask me if I need help and provide it in a timely fashion most days - heck I can usually even find someone at the Walmart to help me find what I need in a polite timely fashion - why wouldn't I expect the same at a tackle shop where the people working there presumably love fishing and should be happy to be surrounded by fishing stuff and fishing talk on a daily basis.  Weird.  Charles the bitter old man"

467198,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-17 15:00:00,932,"I should add something about my Troutfitters trip . . . . how I discovered that they carried Minnows in the first place!  I was calling around, looking for Minnows on a Sunday afternoon and I called Fishing Fanatics, one of the stores I frequent in Kitchener-Waterloo.  I knew they kept good Sunday hours, but not being a minnow-buyer often, I wasn't sure if they had any.  I spoke to Eric and he had a few ideas of how to get some minnows in a pinch, but didn't carry any himself.  10-15 minutes passed and it looked like I was going to have to make alternate plans for the day and the phone rang.  It was Eric calling me back.  He found out in the 10-15 minutes that passed that Troutfitters now carried minnows and told me how to get there.  This is the type of customer service and above-and-beyond decency that we should expect from the places that we spend our money at."
467206,Dutchy,2010-05-17 15:27:00,416,"Price and selection are important, but I do expect a certain level of customer service if I make the effort to go to the shop.

In retail, if the prices aren't the best, then you better have  good quality and selection, and bang on service.

467257,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-17 18:43:00,932," Sounds like they're unorganized as well haha.  A bucket of minnows and a guided tour are clearly in two different brackets, but each and every customer should be treated well . . . that's just my point.  I'm not asking these people to wash my feet: a pleasant hello, offered assistance, and dropping the inquisition would be a good start.  I don't expect them to discuss conditions with people they don't see more often than once.  I wouldn't do that either.  It was apparent they have invented a pedestal and placed themselves directly on top of it."
467259,craigdritchie,2010-05-17 18:46:00,1586,"And that's fine for you, Mike, because you know what you're doing and you know what it is you want to buy. I also buy probably 90 percent of my stuff either online or directly. But I feel sorry for new anglers who are just starting out, and who could really benefit from having some friendly advice - especially from a local dealer who knows their local waters.  Sadly, that's becoming far less commonplace, and no doubt contributes to declining numbers of anglers overall.  I'll add my one exception - Burns Fishing, on Plains Road in Burlington, ON. It's a small, independent shop that can't even begin to compete against the big boys on price. But Steve Burns knows how to compete on service, so he has customers drive to his store from incredible distances. We need more tackle dealers like him."

The service has always been great, prices are pretty good...Location-wise I live down the street from a fair number of shops…The rest of the stuff (mostly carp and some rod building supplies) which I can’t find locally I order online or through mail order.
