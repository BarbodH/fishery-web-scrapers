467143,Stoty,2010-05-17 13:08:00,2910,"Yesterday in Deseronto was the 2010 Quinte Bassmasters Walleye Open on the Bay of Quinte, and boy did it turn out to be a GREAT day for me and the rest of G2 Angling!  Faced with a bluebird sky and no wind, everyone knew the Walleye fishing was going to be tough! Luckily, through extensive experience we had developed a game plan which we thought would work. We focused on getting a couple BIG bites throughout the day, instead of playing it safe and getting a limit of smaller fish and trying to upgrade throughout the day.  We scouted and pre-fished a few days before the event, and believed we had the winning pattern. As it turns out, we were right and ended up with our three fish limit tipping the scales at 18.47 lbs!!  We took the title by just over one pound, and also took ""big fish"" for the day with our 7.98 lb hawg!  Special thanks goes out to all of our sponsors, as well as my partners Grant McAllister and Gary Hodge. It was an amazing team effort to figure out the pattern, and put it into effect!  Here are some pictures from the day:    This is just before blastoff..us going over our plan one last time!     Here is the money shot...with our winning bag of 18.47 lbs!     Us, accepting the first place prize of $1,900 and $760 for ""big fish""     Me releasing one of our fish..     Also, special thanks to Ashley Rae for taking those stellar pictures!  All in all, it was an amazing day and thanks again to everyone for their support!"

467197,Harrison,2010-05-17 14:57:00,2202,"Congrats, I assume you guys were one of the favourites going in and you pulled it off.  Being the favourite and not pulling it off is more then frustrating.  Great job."
467218,Stoty,2010-05-17 16:04:00,2910," LOL!!  All fish were a team effort! Without us all working together, we wouldn't have caught a single fish! It's amazing how many things you have going on when targeting Bay of Quinte Walleye's! A little different than ice fishing!"

467502,Stoty,2010-05-18 13:02:00,2910,"***NPAA Member Press Release***   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 17th, 2010  G2 Angling Seals the deal in their professional debut!!!!  Napanee, Ontario, Canada May 16th, 2010– As the walleye tournament season moved in to full swing on the world renowned walleye capital of the world; Bay of Quinte, NPAA members Grant McAllister #517, Gary Hodge #518 and Jamie Stothart #541 made a splash by sealing the deal in their professional debut at the Quinte Walleye Open! The team weighed a 3 fish limit of 18.47lbs, beating out their nearest competitors by a mere 1lb!  The G2 team also managed to take the Big Fish prize with a post spawn beauty that weighed 7.89lbs! “Going in to this, we spent countless hours developing a game plan. We stuck to it and didn’t waiver! We knew the big fish were still in the recoup mode and it would be a tough bite but we “through ‘em the curve” and came out on top! Reef Runner Little Rippers in tandem with Offshore snap weights were the ticket to our success today; says McAllister. With the use of our top notch electronics from our friends at Radioworld, we knew that getting those baits down in to the strike zone was key, as our 2 big fish came from running that pattern. The kicker fish and undoubtedly, the most important fish, came off a Northland Mr. Walleye Crawler Hauler. We were running the 3 Rippers on Offshore boards when we spotted some big hooks on bottom. We brought in one of the cranks, dropped down the Hauler and bouncer and within 30 seconds; FISH ON; a 4.7lber! All of this took place with 30 minutes left in the tournament!! That’s the fish that won us our first tournament; said an elated Gary Hodge. “We’ll remember this for the rest of our lives!”  Based on the Bay of Quinte in Napanee, Ontario, G2 Angling is a Premiere and Premium guide service that specifically focuses on teaching their clients the fundamentals of walleye fishing while creating memories that will last a life time...
