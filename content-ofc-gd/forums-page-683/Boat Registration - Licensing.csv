467702,Drew_10,2010-05-19 02:35:00,111,Thanks!  I got the trailer certified last Saturday and was able to pick up the plate for it today.  So on the trailer front everything has been taken care of.  Just need to get the boat registered and pick up some insurance (the joys of tourney fishing).  I'll try to stop into a service Canada location soon.  Thanks!
