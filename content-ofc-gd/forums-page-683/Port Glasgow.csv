467420,Banger68,2010-05-18 01:52:00,157,I've seen several commercial fishing boats just to the east. Anybody do any perch fishing in the area?
467423,Banger68,2010-05-18 01:56:00,157," Thanks for the info. I'm not sure if I'll have down riggers on the boat this year, but hopefully next year.  Does the ""Lake Erie boil"" refer to how fast bad weather arrives?"
