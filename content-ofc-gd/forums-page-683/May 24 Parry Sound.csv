467873,TC1OZ,2010-05-19 17:27:00,987,I'll be in Parry Sound from the 23rd to the 26th.  Anyone interested in hooking up on the 24th? I'm pretty much in Seguin Township on one of the many islands (directly across from Parry).  I'll be using my aunts boat and I know a few pike spots. I always enjoy company as the wife wants to turn around after the first hour lol. Just shoot me a PM or post here!
