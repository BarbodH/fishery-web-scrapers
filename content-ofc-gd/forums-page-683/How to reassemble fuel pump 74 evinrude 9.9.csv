467436,10point,2010-05-18 02:23:00,165,I have an issue with my motor that I will get to after I get this fixed. I took apart my fuel pump assembly as pictured below. I am pretty sure it goes back together from left to right in the picture below. What I don't know is where the little plastic like button looking things goes. I think it maybe goes between the 2 and 3rd part from the left in the middle of the two parts. Please help if you can.
