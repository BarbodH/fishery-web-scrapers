467705,johnnyb,2010-05-19 02:43:00,3413,Assuming you mean the 3 Mile Lake between Utterson and Windermere....I've fished it a few times over the years....by mid July it will be pretty warm and very weedy...lots of bass to be had in the likely looking spots...docks....weedfilled bays...not as much natural structure as there used to be because most of the shoreline has been developed now. There is a decent walleye population...and what they tend to do in the heat of the summer is bury themselves in the mud and weeds in shallower areas.   Weedless rigged worms left to sit right in the thick of this stuff can be your friend.
