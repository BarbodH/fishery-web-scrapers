All fish were released except for 3 which took the hook a bit too deep! (how long before I get asked or PM'ed where we were fishing?   )  Dutchy has some more pics which he'll add on to the post but here's the ones from my camera....  Dutchy's 1st Brookie   He got 6 on Friday which is pretty respectable for a first timer  Here's a few of the 10 I got on Friday  (BTW That's a 1000 sized reel for scale and a #4 Panther Martin)       Dutchy's 1st drift on Saturday in the rain produced this beast...   I ended up with around 25 on a rainy, windy Saturday with a few 4""ers and some around the average 8-10""  only a few were big enough for a pics.. Insert Dutchy's camera pics here!  After a slow and rainy start to Sunday with a few small guys each, Dutchy headed out around 3pm and I checked out a little creek with the flyrod...  Ended up with 4 little guys on the fly rod on a stretch of creek I've never fished before (I'll be back!!) Here's a nice little waterfall I happened across while being lazy and driving around some backroads( and not fishing   )   All in all a great weekend! can't wait til next year  jjcanoe"
