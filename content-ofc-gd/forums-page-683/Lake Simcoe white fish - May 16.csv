The crown of the day was my son's very first white fish he pulled all the way up from bottom to surface and Chuck just put it in the net nicely...but Jordan did all the reeling and pulling....though he sure got his work cut for him...didn't give up and managed to complete the job with flying colors ha ha ha....it did help that he just woke up after 3 hours sleep on the boat right before that[]  Few of my favorite shots of the day:           Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

467031,I'mHooked,2010-05-17 00:07:00,525,I like Picture #2! That's an awsome action shot!  It looks like he's hooked an anchor!  I'd love to see my son on something like that.  Looks like it was a fun day.
