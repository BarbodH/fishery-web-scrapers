466979,rock34,2010-05-16 19:19:00,215,Nicely done!! Thanks for sharing
466987,HTHM,2010-05-16 20:07:00,4082,It is done with a technique called downrigging. Search on here or google and you can find a lot of info on it.
466989,splashhopper,2010-05-16 20:15:00,2931,"Nice fish,,,,, but i don;t think I can get my sportspal canoe out to 180 ft of water with the motor ih ave on it"
467046,backbay,2010-05-17 01:21:00,773,"I realize he's downrigging, wondering how much weight he's using."
467050,Fishmaster,2010-05-17 01:37:00,920,I run 10 lb sharks ...and 12 rounds balls ...day to day the round balls deep work better

467365,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-17 23:37:00,0,Nice fish. Always good to see women enjoying the sport. There should be a woman's fishing week!!!Where women can go fishing without a license for a week!  I think its great that they are selling all this pink tackle too. My fishing friend has her own pink rod and tackle box now!!
467387,Aaron Shirley,2010-05-18 00:23:00,655,Nice fish Steve!
