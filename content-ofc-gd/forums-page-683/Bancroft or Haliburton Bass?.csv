467234,flipte,2010-05-17 16:55:00,13,"Hello A couple friends and i are planning a bass trip to the Bancroft or Haliburton area for the Canada Day Weekend. we are looking for some big bass on quiet lakes. we have a 14' fishing boat so the lake must have a launch area.  Any suggestions on what lakes to look into? i know there are thousands of lakes in the region. Were looking for something near (30 min drive) from a city (supermarket, motel or campground with plugs to charge the battery) with some BIG BASS waiting to explode on the first lure they see:). Any Info or suggestions would be great! Thanks in advance"

467247,cityfisher,2010-05-17 17:47:00,959,+1 So many lakes have quality bass population in the area.  I could list another 10 more...
467251,flipte,2010-05-17 18:00:00,13,Dont be shy! Any info would be appreciated. I have a Haliburton lake map and will review the lakes.

467287,jimmer,2010-05-17 20:24:00,2730,"Bass are open on Canada Day, which is July 1st."
467290,CCM,2010-05-17 20:29:00,5,There's a CSFL bass tournament on Haliburton on July 1st.  It could be a little more crowded on the water than normal.
467329,Sinker,2010-05-17 22:05:00,8692,Any lake up there is loaded with bass. They're a PITA! Get rid of a few for me!!  S.
