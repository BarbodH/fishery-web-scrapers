309207,Ziki,2009-02-21 20:33:00,128,"What do you think its worth? Would you take it for trolling on lake O on calm days?  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-b...QAdIdZ104142537  Thanks for any input!  EDIT: Also any guesses on weight? Ive got an Nissan Xtrail with a 2,000 lb towing capacity."
309208,Cudz,2009-02-21 20:36:00,2652,I like it.  Only thing I would question is the size of the motor.  Would rather have 50+ hp.
309213,Bernie,2009-02-21 20:53:00,3190,I think it's priced too high. It's 13 years old.
309218,danbouck,2009-02-21 21:16:00,4380,I also think it's priced too high.
309227,musky_man,2009-02-21 21:42:00,159,I agree - that is a 4500.00 package.
309229,Grimace,2009-02-21 22:03:00,2020,Looks like a good rig.   Priced too high.
309231,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-21 22:06:00,2585,nice rig but yeah priced to high  cheers!
309234,misfish,2009-02-21 22:18:00,29133,"What does the pike on the rock, have to do with the sale?  Offer 3900.Whats the worst he can say?  Does look like a nice clean ride though."
309236,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-21 22:23:00,253,I agree
309238,SlowPoke,2009-02-21 22:28:00,2984,"For $6200 you can have my 18'er and go on Lake O whenever you want LOL. I don't think it's a bad boat but the number that came to my mind was $4500 as well. If you want a Lake O boat, buy a Lake O boat. These aluminiums do nicely on big water and small, don't limit yourself of fishing opportunities if you can avoid it."
309241,smokin joe,2009-02-21 22:33:00,226,"I agree Slowpoke, I picked up a 17' Ranger with a 115 hp last year and have to watch both Erie and Ontario on which days that I could get out.  It's all in what you're looking for."
309247,tdotfisherman,2009-02-21 22:58:00,317,"Check this one out.. it's half the price..  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-b...QAdIdZ108564573  I'd be interested, but I'm looking for something in the 10-12K range....in 3 months."
309249,bigugli,2009-02-21 23:01:00,6138,"The boat is not big enough for Great Lakes running unless you're staying inside the 1 mile mark. As the others said, priced too high.  As for appx weight: on trailer roughly 1000lbs. all out."
309275,misfish,2009-02-22 00:17:00,29133,  When can I pick it up ?
309290,OhioFisherman,2009-02-22 00:42:00,6623,"I have an older 17 foot SmokerCraft a little fancier layout inside and usable on Lake Erie,  if the weather conditions are good. If not it`s an inland lake boat, mine has a 35 merc, rough weather you can`t get off the water quick enough.  Second boat is a copy of my neighbors old boat, same motor, and slower than mine, good boat for inland lakes.  Didn`t notice the price on boat 2 but boat 1 seems high."
309299,Ziki,2009-02-22 00:57:00,128,"http://www.trader.ca/powerpage/details.asp...mp;adid=7358087  What do you guys value that one at?  My budget is $7,000 max"
309302,danbouck,2009-02-22 01:01:00,4380, I think 7k is a decent price for that. I think it should be a 50 on the back though.
309333,OhioFisherman,2009-02-22 01:38:00,6623,"No experience with legend boats, looks like a decent enough outfit, but like Dan I question the motor size. Mine was rated for 60 HP and came with a 35 as a package deal, always kicked myself in the butt for not upgrading to at least a 50hp.  I didn`t need speed to catch fish, it is nice to be able to move around a little quicker on a big body of water, running time cuts into fishing time. Two good sized guys and gear will slow you down with a 30 hp."
