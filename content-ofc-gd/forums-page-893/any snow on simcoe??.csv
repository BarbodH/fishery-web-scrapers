308753,BillM,2009-02-20 18:26:00,17367,I live about 2km's away and I have atleast 14 inches in my driveway.  I think it's a safe bet that you'll have no problems with a sled on Simcoe tomorrow
308810,misfish,2009-02-20 20:33:00,29133,"Yep what Bill said. It,s that nice light fluffy stuff,so it will be flying over yer head as yer blasting around. Just becareful of any pressure cracks that you wont be able to see."

308839,jeffw,2009-02-20 21:28:00,267,I'm hoping I can still drive my 2wd truck out off willow beach tommorow and sun.
308875,richyb,2009-02-20 23:14:00,774,I was out today and theres plenty of snow for a sled. The wind has it all blown into drifts so its a snow drift and then bare ice for a few feet and then snow drift again.
