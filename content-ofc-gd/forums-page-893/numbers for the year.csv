309033,smbhunter,2009-02-21 05:29:00,186,"Ok, what the heck, I'll add a tally. A total of 10 days spent on the ice this year, (a new personal low     ) was spent like this: 1 day on little lake for pike, 2 days on Nipissing, 2 days on Midland bay for herring, the rest on Simcoe. During these 10 days I caught 4 pike, 12 walleye, 6 whitefish, 19 lakers, with several perch and herring mixed in as well. Had 2 horrible days, one on Simcoe and the other on Midland Bay, but managed to avoid the skunk so far this year."
309143,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-21 16:29:00,3761,"Sounds like a great year to me. I might try to keep track of just the bass i get, see how i do lol.  btw-Great math skills"
309152,jwl,2009-02-21 17:10:00,1056,"hard to get a tally going for 2009 so far, but what I see in my pics is pretty close to  30-35 steelies, and 1 OOSer musky out of January and February so far, I have not gotten out nearly enough ion the last say 6-8 weeks    I guess that is not a bad average for that length of time although haven't had a 15-20 fish day on the river in a while"
309316,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-22 01:26:00,2038,Still no White fish...  :wallbash:
