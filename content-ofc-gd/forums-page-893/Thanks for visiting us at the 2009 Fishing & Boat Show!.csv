I  email back to you,but there was no response. This is no offence to you or your baits,but there were alot of email addy,s  that were exposed there for anyone to get.  Just a heads up for your next time.  Best of luck with your baits."
308838,northamfishing,2009-02-20 21:24:00,10,Not sure I understand. Did I do something wrong? let me know eh? I am not the most advanced internet user in the world. My apologies not sure I know what happened.
308842,GBW,2009-02-20 21:36:00,8460,"what he is saying is that when you send an email out to many people the best thing to do is BCC everyone and send the email back to yourself.  this way if the email you send out will not show the others email address.  One of your recent emails you CC'ed everyone (I gater from Brian's reply) so now everyone on that email has each others contact info.  He wasn't being rude or mean about you, your products or company just giving you a heads up as to something that happened. Geoff"
