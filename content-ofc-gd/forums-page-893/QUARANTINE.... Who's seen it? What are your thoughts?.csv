309419,cram,2009-02-22 05:58:00,1733,Has anyone tried that new horseradish flavoured mustard?
309420,rbaquial,2009-02-22 05:59:00,968,"LOL.... sorry, I'm just a lil' p*ssed off @ this stupid movie..."
309421,richyb,2009-02-22 06:08:00,774,well spank my nuts and call me murphy. You should have watched the ufc fights instead. I haven watched the movie but i want to.
309423,steverowbotham,2009-02-22 06:17:00,1800,"i thought it was decent... not awful, not great"
309425,rbaquial,2009-02-22 06:18:00,968,"What REALLY annoyed me about the movie....well, I won't spoil it....but, it annoyed me."
309426,EC1,2009-02-22 06:23:00,930,"i agree with you its a bad movie. If you want to watch those movies that are like taken by a camcorder, cloverfield is MUCH better.  And yes, UFC would have been a good choice tonight, except their main event kinda sucked."
309427,richyb,2009-02-22 06:25:00,774,  yeah i expected more out of diego. He almost looked anorexic trying to be in the 155 weight class.
