Baby is healthy and Mom is doing awesome. I'm on top of the world today for sure.  I cant wait till she can hold that little pink fishing rod. Rylea  Me and Rylea (Those little eyes make me melt everytime)  My wife and I and our little baby girl    All my friends told me what would happen and the feelings but nothing can prepare you for the sensational feeling you get when you first get to hold your first little one.
