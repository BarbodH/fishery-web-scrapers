308126,stan_133,2009-02-19 04:33:00,77,I'm looking to buy a new kicker motor for my 16.5 2000 Alumacraft Lunker and i'm not sure if i sould go with Yamaha or Mercury. In both cases i'm looking for a 6hp 4-stroke kicker. Yamaha's F6 6hp 4-stroke seems to be a bigger motor with a displacement of 197cc and 2-cylinders compared to Mercurys 6hp 4-stroke with 123cc and 1-cylinder. i'm just wondering if anyone has any suggestions out there. thanks guys.

308170,SlowPoke,2009-02-19 12:38:00,2984,"I would go with the Yamaha over the Mercury. The Merc is made by Tohatsu, which also makes Nissan. Same motor only Merc is priced higher. I can't say anything bad about the motor because I don't know much about it but the pricing scheme leaves a bad taste. The Yamaha's are terrific, never seen a bad one! In therory, a 2 cylinder will run smoother than a single (thumper as they used to be known). Single cylinders will often have more torque compared to twins of similer displacment. I think both motors are so small the differences might not be perceivable. If you're interested in a 5hp used Honda, PM me, I can put you in touch with someone. -Brian"
308181,pikehunter,2009-02-19 13:11:00,1659,"Yep, 2 cyl is smoother. Yep Merc is a Tohatsu which is an OK motor but if you set your mind on the Merc then shop around at Nissan outboard motor dealers for a better price, there's one in Oakville.  Compare the weight factor before your final decision. If weight is important, which it probably is, then the 1 cylinder motor may be a better bet."

308193,lew,2009-02-19 14:06:00,12766,"A week ago I'd have said to buy the Merc, but today I'll say buy the Yamaha"
308212,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-19 14:38:00,2038,"Without a doubt ...Yamaha !!!!!!!!   One day I was out fishing and this dude pulled up beside me to poop chat about how the fishing was ..  It was only after 5 / 10 minutes that I realized  his 90 four stroke engine was  Running  .....  Man they run smooth    BTW I own a Merc   ,,,no problems with it , but Yamaha 's run like a top"
308343,steelee,2009-02-19 21:40:00,13,That you Coop
308349,nancur373,2009-02-19 22:00:00,1211,It is Coop indeed.
308356,Sinker,2009-02-19 22:29:00,8692,"I'd take more displacement any day. That is quite a difference too!! As long as weight is not an issue!!!!  I'm not a big merc fan, so its yamaha for me.  Sinker"
308393,linweir,2009-02-19 23:42:00,202,"I believe yahama has better performance, but these motors are expensive."
308435,TJQ,2009-02-20 00:59:00,7806, Ditto....
308436,nancur373,2009-02-20 01:01:00,1211,He gots lotsa money...lol

308510,PERCHER,2009-02-20 02:47:00,787,I would go for the Yamaha.My main motor is a Merc Opti and I wouldnt change it for the world.But when it came to a kicker 4 stroke I went Yamaha.If you are looking at 6hp why not check out the 8hp High Thrust.Great motors for the price difference.I have 9.9 High Thrust and that thing will push 4 foot waves at an idle. Just my 2 cents Dan
