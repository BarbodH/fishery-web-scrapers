So I started working on my variations of a worm harness. I haven't been able to work for a couple of years now, so this helps to pay for the fishing bug. I also use them heavily as a search bait in the boat. Because I fish where there are lots of pike, I've opted for a coated wire vs. floro or mono leaders with lazer sharp hooks  Step 2 is the hardware, beads and blades.  Final step I add a modest bucktail streamer to complete the rig.  And of course the final end result.   They catch fish, and making them keeps me out of trouble"

301849,Leecher,2009-02-05 18:11:00,7832,Beautiful craftmanship Bruce  Great idea adding the bucktail..... gives you the edge needed to trigger stikes Well done!! Jacques
301859,irishfield,2009-02-05 18:37:00,26272,Great stuff Bruce! Wish I had the patience for that... but I don't.
301861,johnnyb,2009-02-05 18:53:00,3413,"Awesome stuff!  So can I order these through the mail, or what?"

301995,bigugli,2009-02-05 23:14:00,6138,I never used to have any time for anything.  Playing with tackle sure beats watching most of the crap on TV these days.  Even I can only handle so much WFN before I start twitchin   As to jwl's question. Yes I do plan on being at the Niagara show.
302074,rockfish,2009-02-06 01:29:00,91,"The ugliboy harnesses are the only thing I've seen Bruce use to drift a river with his ultralight uglystick and 6 lb diameter braid (not an ugli brand, lol) and he does quite well. Better than me since I'm always catching more weeds than anything. Once in a while I do catch something worth while other than rockbass and back in the drink it goes for this elusive fish in some areas of our region. Not a biggie, but the stocking program seems to be doing well. The white pattern worked on this day and Bruce also has some tied up with trebles for pike bait.    "
309029,bigugli,2009-02-21 05:16:00,6138,Finally got a few varieties tied since then.    
309061,b2kptbo,2009-02-21 12:44:00,1505,"Looks good, cool design..."
309066,Greencoachdog,2009-02-21 12:57:00,8163,"Looks real good Bruce!!!  Tackle craft is constructive and artistic outlet, and can be as addictive as"
309075,smokin joe,2009-02-21 13:14:00,226,Great job Bruce!!!  I'll definately have to get a few of those from you  We'll have to get out and try that walleye spot we've been talking about soon.  I'm heading down there in a little while to check it out.  I'll let you know the conditions a little later on
309084,nautifish,2009-02-21 13:27:00,1416,Very nice.
