Is that where everyone parks, or is there somewhere else I'd have to go? Thanks in advance."
308721,Fisherman,2009-02-20 16:59:00,7201,"Intersection of Big Bay Pt Rd and the 30th Side road, turn left, that's where you go down to access the lake.  Pay attention to the No Parking signs and don't park within 9M or 30"" of any intersection or you'll be paying the ticket."

308988,Cudz,2009-02-21 03:38:00,2652,get there early or no parking for you.  Parking fine is $30 and they do ticket.  Make sure you are at least 9m from the intersection.
