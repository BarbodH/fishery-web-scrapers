Looking at getting a fishfinder for the boat but now after going to the boat show and realizing that there are some nice places to go and not take my boat my thoughts on fishfinders changed.  I now am looking for a portable that I can attach to my boat and remove as necessary to go to these remote places and use for ice fishing as well.  Any ideas - humminbird 565 a good choice or give me your thoughts"
