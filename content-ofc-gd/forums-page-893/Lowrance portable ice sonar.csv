I realize that the X67C ice machine does it as well, but the portable kit seems to give me everything I need to convert it to the same type of unit."
309065,mbac31,2009-02-21 12:56:00,904,I have this portable pack from Lowrance for 3 of my units. They work great and I have never had a problem. Just make sure you follow the battery charge times correctly and even charge the battery while not in use in the summer and you will be fine.
309214,motion,2009-02-21 20:55:00,403,Do you use it for ice fishing?
309266,mbac31,2009-02-21 23:49:00,904,Yes I have this kit which I take my electronics from my boat and use them ice fishing as well. I do this for the GPS points from softwater fishing.
