309119,Spiel,2009-02-21 15:03:00,9065,"I spoke with my buddy this morning and he tells me he has a 15' Loomis GLX blank for sale, $700.00."
309124,solopaddler,2009-02-21 15:22:00,8605,"That's correct Chris, I've seen the blanks including the 15'er and they're pristine. For those of you who like the new GLX's but aren't too thrilled with the sub par factory build here's your chance!  Already posted for sale in the floatboard classifieds:  have 3 GLX Floatrod blanks,  1- STR 1562 GLX blank $650.00 cdn  1- STR 1563 GLX blank $650.00 cdn  1- STR 1803 GLX blank $700.00 cdn  These are factory rods that have been stripped. The blanks have been completely cleaned and are in pristine condition. There is a small amount of epoxy residue where the handle was. This would be less than 20"" from the butt of the rod. These rods took me no less than 4 hours each to strip and considering the retail on these rods the value of my labour is pretty low. I would prefer that you would pm me if you are interested. These prices are firm. No trades. Pick-up only. I am in the Niagara region."
309126,jace,2009-02-21 15:26:00,472,  Is that a proper float blank or a 15' spey blank?    I didn't think the glx floats were sold as blank only.
309145,River Rat,2009-02-21 16:32:00,161,"They are not offered in a blank.....if you read carefully, Solo said he stripped them down himself. I've done it too and trust me, it takes a long time to strip them properly without damaging the blank. Solo is the man for the job though, I think he has stripped a ton of rods over the years!  RR"
309156,Spiel,2009-02-21 17:21:00,9065," Actually in this case RR Solo has just copied and pasted my buddies ad from floatfishing.net. I also concur that stripping rods is a very time consuming tedious job, extremely labour intensive!"
309160,cplummer,2009-02-21 17:41:00,165,lots to chose from!! depending what your looking for in a rod.. I carry Loomis canada and rainshadow blanks  but the options and prices are endless!!!   I build the rods reasonable  to keep costs down  and art work is endless on the blank too.... CCRods and fly tying.....
309169,Marko,2009-02-21 18:29:00,854,and i thought my 100 dollar rod was expensive lol. Crazy pricing on some of those rods
309180,solopaddler,2009-02-21 19:14:00,8605," I'd love it if Loomis still made float rod blanks, but they don't unfortunately.  On a side note I'm very very impressed with the 13' 2pc Rainshadow XST blank. Fantastic blank to build a custom rod with and not too expensive. Its spec's are very similar to the highly touted 13' IMX but it's got way more power in the butt."
308624,okumasheffield,2009-02-20 13:24:00,318,"Hi all,  It has been a while since my last post. Lets say I had been dealing with expected events in life until just now.  Since things didnt turn out the way I wanted/planned them to be no matter how hard I have tried, I have decided to buy myself a very FIRST CUSTOM rod.  Wonder what blanks you guys would recommend and the price range and other helpful stuff I should know before talking to any builders  Thanks"
308639,BillM,2009-02-20 13:43:00,17367,For a floatrod?  I've heard through the grapevine that the Rainshadow XST blanks should definitely be looked at.
308640,Spiel,2009-02-20 13:45:00,9065,There are many options. First how much are you willing to spend and of course what will you be using it for?
308646,kemper,2009-02-20 13:51:00,2232,"rainshadow, CTS, IMX and on and on and on  Depends what you want to spend, and who you want to build it."
308647,okumasheffield,2009-02-20 13:53:00,318,"Ooops, I meant 'unexpected' events in life  Below is what I think  - Float rod - 15-feet at least (I think 17' is too long for places I usually fish at - 3 pieces (I guess this is a no brainer) - Weight, as light as possible - Action & Backbone (I tend to like stiffer rod) - SiC guides (this is top of the line, right? does it really make any difference?) - Large top guide for winter - Fixed reel seat (another no brainer, haha)  - Money to spend .... uhm ... would 1000 enough or need more?"
308648,KelfuN,2009-02-20 13:54:00,246,Kingpin rod at angling outfitters. the factory rod is available. blanks will be soon..
308653,Spiel,2009-02-20 14:07:00,9065,I think a $1000 will get you anything you want.
308655,okumasheffield,2009-02-20 14:16:00,318,I am glad $1000 is more than enough ... was afraid that I need to sell my kidneys for extra cash  What blanks are recommended and where can I put my hands on them to have 'touch-and-feel' experience?
308659,BillM,2009-02-20 14:25:00,17367,"If you are going to get a custom rod, why not match up reel and get it balanced absolutely perfect?"
308668,Spiel,2009-02-20 14:42:00,9065," Well I'm partial to Loomis. As for hands on, well that depends, where are you located?"
308670,okumasheffield,2009-02-20 14:51:00,318,"Ofcourse I will balance the rod with the reel  BTW, it is Kelfun who has the KINGPIN centerpin not I.  I am at Thornhill  GLX from G-Loomis?"
308676,Spiel,2009-02-20 15:07:00,9065,I think John Collina in Caledonia is the guy you should get in touch with.
308686,MJL,2009-02-20 15:38:00,2427,"From what I can find, CTS and Raven are the only ones to have float blanks to 15’ readily available on the market.  If you can find one, House of Hardy also made them to 15’ but I’ll wager that you probably might not like the action much if you’re used to the newer float rods with faster tapers.  Talon at one time made them to 17’ but I’ve only seen 1 around 12 years ago.  15’ Loomis IMX blanks (If you can find one) were chop-shopped by various individuals from other rods (I have no clue which) to get them that length – At least that’s what their old rep told me.  One of my friends found a butt extension in his rod when he went to rebuild the handle.LOL The GLX currently do not come in blank form unless you strip it down and do a rebuild.  As Spiel mentioned, I’d definitely get in touch with a few rod builders like: John Collina (JC tackle - Caledonia) Tom Cheng (AngSpec - Concord) George Cheng (AngSpec – Scarborough) Billy (Wilsons – Toronto) Randy (Natural Sports – Kitchener) Phil Ptak (Not sure if he’s still building but I can get you his contact info if you need – Buffalo, NY)  I’ve built 2 15’ rods in the past for my friends (Raven IM9, House of Hardy) and in terms of cost (flor grade cork, Fuji SIC, rosewood reel seat + butt, blank, labour), they were in the neighbourhood of $670 - $790 (not including tax)."
308763,okumasheffield,2009-02-20 18:51:00,318,"Wow, stripping down a GLX and to rebuild ... sounds VERY EXPENSIVE!"
308771,MJL,2009-02-20 19:06:00,2427," No clue how much it would be to strip down a GLX.  At least there's no hook keeper to get in the way.LOL  I'm guessing You would probably void the warranty by doing so which in retrospect, may cost you more in the long run should you break it."
308774,highdrifter,2009-02-20 19:10:00,2534,Planning on blowing your load are ya?  Last time I checked Sage still makes a limited number of blanks for float rods..  Now THAT would be treating yourself!!  HD
308776,Spiel,2009-02-20 19:15:00,9065,"Sage spey blank 10150-4 TCX 15'0"" 4pc.  6 1/2 oz  $463.00/American"
308785,MJL,2009-02-20 19:30:00,2427," If he built it, it would be the most powerful float rod in the history of man-kind  It may possess a power so great that mere mortals like us cannot contemplate on how to handle it."
308787,mikeh,2009-02-20 19:32:00,824,I was in Angling Speialties (kennedy rd location) the other day and he had a G-loomis already made up but I am not sure of the price.
308791,highdrifter,2009-02-20 19:37:00,2534,"  That a ten wheight Chris?  Seems kinda heavy for a noodle rod..  Like Mike said..  As mere mortals, we would tremble before the might of this powerful thunderbolt of a shtick!!  WUUUUUUTTTT!!"
308809,Spiel,2009-02-20 20:30:00,9065,Properly balanced and guideless it'd make an awesome spear.
308814,aniceguy,2009-02-20 20:44:00,1094,"if your looking for a really sweet rod, there is one here for sale by fusion I fished that rod and was sad to let it  go for te price its a sweet stick"
308815,MJL,2009-02-20 20:45:00,2427," There’s nothing in this world that could safely contain the power of that rod.  If you stuck it in a nuclear reactor core, you could power the cities of Toronto, Pickering, Mississauga, Oakville and Hamilton for 1000 years just from its awesomeness.  In the wrong hands it’s a weapon of mass destruction bent on annoying anglers within 1km downstream of you while you make mega long-distance drifts and hooksets.  Far too much power for only 1 man to control"
308817,River Rat,2009-02-20 20:46:00,161,"for 15's You are down to the IM9 (not sure if offered in a blank but I know they used to be).....or JC's CTS.....I would choose the CTS, no contest. John is a very good builder and the 15ft is his signiture rod. If seen it dressed and undressed    and it's a good med nd big water rod. WAY more power than the GLX. The cost will be well under $1000 with hardloys and the fit will be unbelieable. Titanium SICs are he best of he best and will get you closer to that $1000 but will never snap off or crack the inserts...tuff as nails.  Side note on the new Kingpin: The Kingpin is not yet offered in a blank or a 15fter......the blanks will be out in the late fall of 09, the 15fter....still working on getting them to see the market potetial. The 13fter is $350 and the 11'6"" is $295........2pc, Fuji solid titanium guides (not coated) with sic inserts - 7's to the tip for ice up, line rated 4-8, IM8 matt green grafite with green wraps, no seats just rings and both have a 20.5 inch handle.  The 11'6"" is lightening fast, with the long handle this is the ideal med and small water rod with torquing power to spare, crisp snap up that float and place it in the tightest of cover. The 13 has a more traditional action througout but the backbone underload was unbelieveable......I have yet to fish them but I'm hoping to get them out Sunday for a trial run.  RR"
