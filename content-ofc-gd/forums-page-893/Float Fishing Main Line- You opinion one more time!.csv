309206,Mark Mc,2009-02-21 20:26:00,8,"Personally I would recommend Ande 10lb. I switched to it 5 years ago and have not had any problems so far. It costs alot less than many others and does just as good of a job. As far as line twists, I run a 2 swivel system. Float on mainline followed by a swivel, then a shot line with my weights, then another swivel, then 6lb drennan floro down to the hook.  I find the 2 swivel system drastically reduces line twists while saving floats from snags, etc. In fact, I have used the same 3 floats for the last 3 years.  As far as the 6lb mainline goes, yeah u might be able to land 30lb chinnies with it but it is going to take to damn long to land fish, thus making it ALOT harder to revive the fish if you plan on releasing it with the possibility of the fish going belly up down river because a lack of strength. Plus you're going to screw up other fisherman's drifts for a prolonged period of time. Anything more than 10-15 minutes max and you would get my line casted over top of it, until you get the hint or your line snaps, whichever comes first.  "
306888,baironhorse,2009-02-16 03:06:00,145,Ok One last time gents. Im confused and don't know which line to pic. Ive been using Iron Silk in past but discontinued by Berkley and my stock is finished. Your thoughts on: Raven or Maxima or Siglon(which one??)?? Before I go out and spend the cash would like to know your thoughts. Thx
306906,mtpockets2,2009-02-16 04:10:00,12,Suffix for me on the main line. I use suffix for all my river stuff.
306908,buckster,2009-02-16 04:14:00,530,ande line!  Cheap and strong!
306920,centerpin_drift,2009-02-16 04:47:00,94,"ande's will twist itself up after a long day floating worms, ive had it happen way to many times. i used maxima ultragreen for the past few season and its one of my favorites, super strong, limp, low stretch, and doesnt twist as easy.  Recently ive switch to P line flurocarbon which has turned out to be a nice line, very strong, low visibity, very limp, doesnt twist well, but it does tend to have a little more stretch then the maxima monofiliment.  i always use maxima mono for my leader.  hope this helps a bit  mike"
306925,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-16 05:00:00,10439,I have been using Raven the last few seasons and really like it expecially when using the higher test main lines that I'm using out west. My goto line is now Raven 12# and it handles very well.
307008,steelhead hunter,2009-02-16 16:24:00,152,suffix superior high vis yellow is the best I've used in a long time I haven't had any problems with twisting at all. raven on the other hand was crap line twist from hell an hour after I started useing it
307020,silvio,2009-02-16 17:39:00,433,siglon v 10 pound
307021,centerpin_drift,2009-02-16 17:41:00,94,anything over 6 pound test and your crazy
307024,silvio,2009-02-16 17:49:00,433, You like to fight the fish to its' death?
307041,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-16 18:40:00,10439,"  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight......... you wouldn't have a chance landing a decent sized fish in the water I fish. My main pinning is done on a river that runs between 2500 and 8000 cfs depending on time of year. Good luck landing a 30"" bow there with your mighty 6# test main line."
307073,jdmls,2009-02-16 20:45:00,575," ya, keep telling yourself  6lb main line catches more fish than 12lb  + I like getting the majority of my rig back from a snag"
307082,T.Barry,2009-02-16 21:11:00,24,"If you like ironsilk, then you will probably not like raven.  Raven has a thin diam. for the lb. test it is rated for, so the abraison resistance is not as good as ironsilk or most other lines.  Most guys that like raven run the higher line rating (10-12 lbs.) for this exact reason. Maxima ultragreen is a good choice so is PLine CXX (which in my opinon are almost indentical lines in every way).  My go to line the last few years has been Sufix Pro mix 8Lbs. not to expensive and great abraison resistance just like ironsilk."
307098,salmon,2009-02-16 21:59:00,334, Ditto I do not use anything less than 10lb Raven and usually Drennan 6lb flouro lead.  Jose
307136,BillM,2009-02-16 23:07:00,17367,"I use 10lb Siglon V Ultra green along with 5.5lb Raven flouro leader.  It's all personal preference.  I also used the high vis Siglon and had zero issues...  When the water isn't very clear, I use Maxima 6lb for my leader."
307373,NAC,2009-02-17 13:35:00,369, Not sure what you meant by this? Been using 8lb since the early 90's...  no complaints.  Side casting from centrepins and on spinning reels. But if you insist on spending more for line...  just one persons opinion of course.
307399,Joeytier,2009-02-17 15:32:00,3990,I use Suffix 8 lb hi vis.  Great line.
307410,steelheader42,2009-02-17 16:07:00,44,I like raven myself for steelheading...l find it nice an soft an for the price you cant go wrong just my toughts...cheers
307427,centerpin_drift,2009-02-17 16:43:00,94,ive been pulling out 25lb salmon on my stanton with 6 pound test and 4 pound leader for over 15 years old out of fast water.  any day you wanna see come down to the banks of the beaver river and ill battle a 30'' any day through ice flow with 6lb test.
307446,jdmls,2009-02-17 17:47:00,575," Your clearly not getting the point ...... Yes we all agree with you that  6lb will work, but it is not necessary for many good reasons listed above"
307457,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-17 18:27:00,10439, I'm sure the other 40 guys fishing the flats with you love waiting an hour for you to land that 25# chinny.
307471,silvio,2009-02-17 19:52:00,433,1 25 pound chinny 1 man with 6 pound test 1 hour of everyone time Every fishermanâ€™s face and comments during that hour battle ... Priceless.
308129,baironhorse,2009-02-19 04:48:00,145,Thx to all for your thoughts... great stuFff!
308136,KelfuN,2009-02-19 05:55:00,246,"spooled 8lb sufix, didnt have the confidence without knowing the breaking point of the line. so i spooled it back with siglon 10lb..and i know it will break at 10!"
308203,Bernie66,2009-02-19 14:23:00,123,"Sufix, Siglon ,Gamma ,P-line, etc are all good lines.  Break strength is always higher than what is on the spool.  Typically 8lb test will break between 12-15lb strength and your lighter fluoro leader should break way before that."
309193,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-02-21 19:43:00,0,"Nothing more needs to be said as Sil spelled it out exactly, a few of the guys I fish with would just cut his line or burn it with a lit cig.  Have a Rainbow Day"
