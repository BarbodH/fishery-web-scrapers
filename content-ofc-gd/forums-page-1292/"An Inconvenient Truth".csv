19006,outahere,2007-01-04 16:04:00,6,"I am some what surprized that with so many concerned comments, not one of them examines the Canadian Government's position on carbon emissions.  In November, environment minister (probably changed today) Rona Ambrose stated that ""Canada remains strongly committed to Kyoto"", but at a recent Senate committee meeting Abrose stated the government's intention to renege on a pledge to cut carbon emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.  ""We cannot meet the target. We have ample evidence that this is not feasible."" The new plan delays any regulations on emissions until 2010 and then calls for cuts only in greenhouse gas intensity, which is a measure of the carbon produced per dollar of economic activity---a formula that allows total emissions to continue to rise as long as the economy is growing.  There would be no absolute reduction in emissions until after 2020, then deeper cuts of 45 to 65 per cent around 2050.  If you are really concerned about the likely reality of global warming....contact your local federal politician.  Most of the world (except the US) is stunned by Canada's response to the Kyoto treaty. On another point...do not confuse the ""warmest winter""  with the ""warmest year"".  The 5 warmest YEARS on record have all occured since 2000."
19028,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-04 18:14:00,0,"I don't have time to read all of the replies but for what it's worth I think it's all bunk. Experts tells you about global warming and other experts tell you it doesn't exist. Who are we to believe. I personally think it's all politics just like the Quebec seperation deal, all talk and it will never happen. It sure keeps some people employed though.  The weather sure is changing through the times but who is really to blame?  Trust me I'm one to do all I can to protect our enviroment but I'm never going to believe is this bunk."

19042,Kirk,2007-01-04 18:53:00,347,Regardless of what you believe or don't beleive about global warming...cutting down pollution is just the right thing to do.  What I don't beleive is that democrats/liberals own the solution to this problem.  Democrat/Liberal friendly Hollywood types sure make lots of videos and movies casting Bush as the villain for every problem.  Meat loaf doesn't stick together? Bush's policies caused it !!! A creak in your door? must have been Bush.

19115,John Bacon,2007-01-04 23:42:00,3277," At least they do have a plan to eventually cut emissions.  The Liberals made a big deal out of signing Kyoto, but they never actually implemented any plans to ever reduce emissions.  The Kyoto accord will not lead to a reduction in emissions, (the two most populous contries in the world are allowed to polute as much as they want under the agreement) it would only lead to Canada paying large sums of money to other contries for not meeting the targets.  Everybody dumps on Bush for not signing Kyoto; but the US's emissions only increased by 16% while Canada's increased by 25%.  And the per capita emission from the US were already lower than Canada's to begin with.  So much for the Liberals committment to the environment."
19249,brickNblock,2007-01-05 13:47:00,598,"Great thread Dan! Exellent responses from many here, and totally unexpected-(welcomed)- intelligent banter on a topic everyone who calls this planet home, should not only have some education on but, actually, contributing to  the betterment of our environment in some manner or another. I've not seen this Gore Video....but I've read a little on the topic. The pollutes we let into our environment, wether be it into the air, waterways or ground...100% Nasty and Negligent, as well Irresponsible!!! I believe, that we people, most of us......are ruled by the almighty dollar and that is not going to change, therefore, dangerous emmisions and other pollutants will continue to be resulting from our required lifestyles. I dont have a thought on what can be done....... We recycle everything that comes into our household........is this necessarily a good thing when you consider the products that are being manufactured from the recycleables. specially when these products are what we generally see on our roadsides. Who knows.........One thing for sure! Mother Nature takes care of herself........in the end! I was also around when when the threat was the comming iceage, before this global warming so who really knows?"
19319,Seahag,2007-01-05 16:52:00,19,I just saw this movie on my dish and i was very impressed.  For me to be impressed by an enviroment tree hugging film is one giant step for man kind.  I'll admit i have never been that concerned.  I never disrespected the enviroment but it was never on my radar.  I think in the past the tree huggers have ruined it with their way of presenting facts and harassing us on small scales.  It always left a bad taste in my mouth when some little squeeker came up yelling at us about recycling and other things.  This movie impacted my thoughts and made me think about ways i should improve my own life and how those changes can impact the enviroment for the better.  This movie just was the right type of information and a proper way to communicate that info with out attacking us as individuals.  anyhow.  I think anyone would benefit from watching this.  It isn't geeky.  it's real life.  They should be showing this in highschools accross the country.  maybe even middle schools.  Al Gore doesn't seem like such a bad guy.  Makes me think what the world might be like today if the States had him as President
19510,glirw,2007-01-06 01:16:00,200,"Wow very glad i found this thread , and on OFC of all places , where some of the brightest minds reside !!  I read some of the posts in this lengthy thread , and I decided to bring my opinion to the table  , and i dont think anyone has mentioned it yet .  Ladies and gents , i truly believe this earth is millions of years old , no matter what religions tell us , each is entitled to their own beliefs . Before we humans arrived , there were other species living here , and they maintained a balance for many years , ice ages here , new species there , extinctions here , dinosaurs there , and then came humans .  Just like any species  , we aren't eternal , and no matter what we do to this earth , we can't destroy it , because it is self regulating .  If we put too much pressure on the earth , it is going to get back at us with more severe storms , and other natural disasters that will bring the earth's population back down to a sustainable level, simple as that  . Yes , we can say that it's a scary thought that some day we are all going to be in alot of suffering , but look at the greater picture , we are just another species , and just like all other animals , we have a beginnning , and we have an end .  I WHOLE HEARTEDLY agree that it sucks that our politicians don't care about this problem , but that's simply because we as the citizens aren't putting any pressure on them . If humanity as a whole realizes that we are in trouble , and wants to change something , i have no doubt in my mind a massive change will happen . We live in a liberal society , everybody cares about themselves , and information is SO readily available these days , EVERYBODY knows about global warming , and it's basic consequences.  I saw this movie , and although i wish we could stop the damage , we can't , there are just too many people on this earth , and our ecological footprint is too big .  When the earth feels that it's under too much pressure , it will tell us , and somewhere down the line , whether thousands or millions of years ahead , just like the gobies came into the great lakes , a new species will come and replace humans , simple as that .   KEEP FISHING , and do as much as you can . By can i mean , just enough that youre not suffering ."

I think he gave us a lot to think about, but that's it.. remember..he is the guy that tried to take credit for inventing the internet"
19724,mrdylan,2007-01-06 17:11:00,111,I have not seen this but I plan to.  I don't doubt that we are messing this planet up bad and a lot of what is in this video could very well be true but In the 80's it was Al Gores wife who created all those documentaries and fought against Hard rock & Heavy Metal music stating that it was the work of Satan himself and that if all of the kids in the world listened to it It too would be the end of civilization. I mean come on it's music. I grew up listening to it and I own a house a Trailer have a wife & 2 amazing kids and a job that more than pays my bills.  Again I have not seen this movie and I don't doubt for one second that everything we do here on earth has a serious impact one way or another but I think their religous beliefs etc hinder the actual facts.
19853,SikkuDog,2007-01-07 02:20:00,8,"I've been following this post closely ...  and personally, I love the fact that this has stirred comments and opinions on the topic that are wide and varied.  Its clearly at topic that is close to everyone's heart and that isn't surprising given the fact that everyone that is a member of this forum is close to fishing and the nature/environment that surrounds it.  Whether we agree or disagree with the concept of 'global warming', I still feel that the indisputable fact is that we - as human beings - are damaging the balance of nature on this planet.  To think otherwise is putting our heads in the sand.  Like I said in an earlier post, the movie is riddled with faults - the most glaring being the political slant of Al Gore.  I am not an US citizen.  I do will not be voting for Al Gore or any party he's involved with.  And I don't think it's fruitful to even begin the discussion of Canadian politics on the topic in this forum.  Politicians are politicians.  But I honestly believe that that this is a topic that deserves the attention of all of us and as much as I hate to admit it - demands the attention of our elected leaders in Canada (and globally).  Forget the movie for moment - think about this issue.   Stop and ask yourself how our fishing environment has changed in our lifespan and what the logical cause of that is.  And then what we can (and must) do about it.  Trevor Butcher (aka 'Sikku' - my beloved and recently departed Siberian Husky)"

18651,bassfighter,2007-01-03 17:46:00,366,"I kept a copy of this video, and also saw another Richard Attenborough's documentary two night ago on the same issue on Global Warning.  It is nice to know that Al Gore is Gung Ho on this issue, I pray that his vision to pursue this issue will pay off and he will be remembered for something positive not just a mere defeated presidential candidate. I was impress and respected him for his effort on this issue.  I was a pro Bush when the Sept 11 attack happened, but after seeing this video and what has transpired about the war in Iraq, I would vote for Gore, today just by this Global warning issue. Without being an important leader who can make drastic decision and an issue that is not important to many of us, who would take Global warning seriously!  I was impress with the information provided, and my 11 year old son loves documentary movies. I told him that if we do not do our part, their generation will suffer more from it. We are already feeling the consequence of no snow in Toronto.  The retail is being hurt for people will postpone their winter shopping; Where is the mighty Christmas Spirit these days: no snow during the holiday means no winter sport fun for the kids, no outdoor skating or ice hockey, they will end up watching more TV at home and do less outdoor sport.  Fishing has not been the greatest either, all river system has been constantly dirty within the past two months, the ground has not frozen. Those who loves Ice fishing will miss their holiday Ice fishing.  How will the trout know when to spawn, when they normally spawn during April or May? By Spawning too early , being confuse with the springlike temp, and weeks down the road, true winter temp comes , how can their eggs stand a chance to survive. When the fingerlings hatch too soon ,and not enough insect to feed on , they wil die as well.  North America is considered the worse polluter among all the continents, we are trying to influence our habits, lifestyle and thinking to other third world nation like China and India, and they will eventually copy our  bad system and habits as well.  No wonder, many countries despises US policy, when they seemed to care about others, and yet they can be the worse culprit in destroying our environment.  As Citizen of this nation, What can we do to help our environment? I notice that some us are throwing our personal garbage, such as lure packaging, styrofoam worm container, bottled water, and Timmy cup everywhere we fish, not only these are recyclable, but the beaufiful scenary is ruined by garbage everywhere.  We can try to convoy or invite another anglers to join us when we go fishing to save money on gas, which cuts down on gas usage and lessen the emmission output . Buy more gas efficient vehicle, even if we have to sacrifice power and image.   Global Warning seemed to be an impossible task to tackle, but by contributing our individual effort, and being a good example to those around us and to our children, there is hope that others will be influence as well!  Thanks for the reminder and bringing this important issue to light! It is 2007,  A good new year resolution that can be added to our list. We OFNers' can make a difference to our environment."
18665,Cookslav,2007-01-03 18:54:00,1457,"I'm going to have to see this video...  I'm not sold on the Global warning theory as it stands just yet. But then again I have not seen the documentary either.  I have to wonder if some of the hype is not related to the mass media coverage we have these days? 100 years ago we didn't know about severe storms and water temps around the globe, and more importantly there were very few weather stations monitoring the day to day weather...  Currently there are so many monitoring stations taking in information by the second...its bound to skew the numbers a bit when comparing the data over the last 50 years...my question would be how much is fact and how much is skewed numbers?  For exsample... This winter is not the warmest on record, infact thus far its shapeing up to be the 4rth warmest (according to last nights CTV news)  And the next 10 warmest before that were spread out in the 40's 70's and 80's No real diffinitive pattern. But in light of the recent Warm winter...Global warming is a very popular topic.  Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying its not happening. I'm just unsure that it isn't a bit exsaturated and if this isn't more of a long term trend (like 100+ years) I think there has been little work done, or published to disprove climate change over longer periods of time in not a Naturally occuring proccess?  In my own limited experience I've seen little to suggest something iminant is occuring...I guess living in Southern Ontario could be skewing that veiw being our weather is a best very unpredictable. I've seen Green Christmas's, and snowy May 24 weekends, 30degrees in september, and July's were the temp didn't break 21 degrees...  No mind you I think we still need to approach pollution with the same level of aggression...no doubt I'm just not so sure Global warming is not to some degree a naturally occuring event. I'll give the video a once over and see if it changes my tune a bit"
18671,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-03 19:04:00,2582,Cookslav One of the facts that the video presented was that the top 10 warmest years every recorded have all happened in the last 14 years. Watch the video and look into the topic some more on your own. A very thought provoking video.
18681,Cookslav,2007-01-03 19:26:00,1457,See thats just it... So much contadicting evidence going in both directions. Last nights news says the 10th warmest winters in Canada are spread out since the 40's. And Canada's leading meteroligist David Philips is hesitant to say Globlal warming is or is not a naturally occuring event?  While the Gore video says globaly the temps have been increasing siginificantly over  the last 14 years....who do I believe. Gore or Philips LOL...  There are a Gazillion studies that say its pollution...but as of lately there are a ton of studies saying its a natural cycle as well.  Looking out my window into my back yard over the past 30 years I have no reason to be concerned.  But I guess I'll watch the video and see what I can take from it...can't hurt right 
18686,Headhunter,2007-01-03 19:36:00,5703,"I think Mr. Gore has found a way to increase his visibilty south of the border and in turn, set himself up for the up coming election. He may well win the presidential nomination, based largely on the success of this documentary and the fact that the Dem. party will not have to spend as much time, money or energy, getting his name into the public mind. Folks, it's all about winning elections. He's a politian and will do anything to win. Is anyone really surprised by this? Take a look at Stephan Dion's number one topic of interest.... the Environment. It's the hot topic currently and will stay that way until someone else comes up with something else that captures the publics interest. In the mean time... it creates a license to receive votes. HH"

17318,outahere,2006-12-30 18:44:00,6,"Marc    Sea-floor drill cores have shown no correlation between the magnetic reversal of the poles, or their absence over prolonged periods of time, and the global temperature.  There is a significant increase in high energy solar radiation  (cosmic rays,etc) that is normally directed to the polar regions by the earth's magnetic field, striking other areas of the earth, and this can be of serious consequence for increased UVB striking many areas, but not for increased heating.   The earth's axis is tilted approximately 23 degrees away from vertical, and during our winter in the northern hemisphere, the earth is approximately 4 million miles closer to the sun (closest Jan 4 each year).  If in fact, the poles were to reverse physically,ie.the land mass, it would mean the earth would have to flip over, and there is no suggestion that this is what happens when the magnetic poles reverse.  So for the next little while, the closeness to the sun in winter will continue to lessen the impact of our pointing away from the sun at that time but may hasten the impact of global warming on the north pole regions."

Since then the average global temperature has jumped a couple of degrees C. and the newest disaster in the opposite direction is helping Albert Gore, Jr. sell his book and his movie.  When it comes to global cooling and global warming, I like global warming better.  The hottest day I've experienced on this planet was my first, on July 23, 1934 in SW Ohio and the temperature soared to 112 F.
