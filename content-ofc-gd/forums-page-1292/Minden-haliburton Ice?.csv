17424,Jigger,2006-12-31 00:55:00,1237,"Hey, fishboy. Was up at the inlaws on 12Mile today. Some shore ice here and there on the bigger lakes and sheltered bays have a good skim coat. Some of the smaller lakes are covered, but I'm not sure I'd be willing without water-wings. Hope alls well with you and yours. Happy New year!"
17530,fishboy,2006-12-31 05:26:00,550,thanks for the updates-still hoping that next week we'll have some safe ice
17544,Iamcanadian,2006-12-31 10:20:00,14,"We went out yesterday and checked some ice on some smaller lakes. We rode our atvs down one lake- 5"" of good ice on that lake 2 other lakes had about 3-4"" and a bigger lake had 1-2"" . We are heading out in the morning for splake,rainbow and specks!"
17604,fishboy,2006-12-31 15:24:00,550, Great news-I'll be heading up on Tuesday; thanks for the update.
18100,fishboy,2007-01-01 17:42:00,550,Just wondering if anyone was out today and had a chance to check some ice or even wet a line...
18110,irishfield,2007-01-01 18:09:00,26272,Poured rain ALL night up here. Presume it did the same East of here..
18272,Jigger,2007-01-02 04:12:00,1237,"Was up there today, looks like you should bring the long rod. Some shore ice outside the cottage maybe2in or so .Walked out 2 steps CRRRRAAACK! Even the smaller lakes that we drove by looked pretty sketchy."
18276,fishboy,2007-01-02 06:18:00,550,It wasn't sounding promising from the different reports I'd heard so we've postponed until later in the month.
18280,Iamcanadian,2007-01-02 09:31:00,14,"We made it out yesterday 10 guys and 9 atvs all on the lake at once 4-5"" of ice and 15 splake. It was a great day . It doesnt look good for the rest of the week!"
18285,turtle,2007-01-02 11:12:00,274,"I was up there at my cottage on the weekend.  No ice on the main lake and maybe 4 inches (augered a hole for water) on the bay we are on.  That was Saturday.  By Monday morning the bay didnt look too promising, snow cover had melted with the warm weather and rain showing open areas.  On the way out even the ice on the beaver dams was starting to melt with lots of flow for ths time of year. Looked really unsafe Monday."
20055,Iamcanadian,2007-01-07 21:43:00,14,"I went back to the lake I went  to on Jan 1st, lost some ice near shore but still managed to drive across it with 5 atvs, ice was between 2-4"" parked the atvs on shore this time just to be safe! The splake were not as active today, lost a few and caught a few. Still had a great day!"
