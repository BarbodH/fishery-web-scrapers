19531,SNAGMAN,2007-01-06 02:09:00,2,"Hello Fellas & Gals, First let me wish everyone a very Happy and Prosperous New Year, Its been quite awhile since I posted here on OFC and I am sorry to bore you with this first post of mine for 2007. But I find it really important to do so and squelch the rumor that is raging from Windsor heading across the province. The Rumor: Willis ""SNAGMAN"" Beam along with a financier has took over ownership of WALLY's BAIT & TACKLE SHOP located in Windsor Ontario.  I Willis ""SNAGMAN"" Beam can assure everyone who hears of this rumor that it is completely false. I have not nor ever by myself or with a partner purchased or own WALLY'S BAIT & TACKLE SHOP.  I am an Independent Field Tester for companies like Milts Brand Tackle, Woodies Baits, Canadian Wiggler and Zebco/Quantum Rods-Reels. I also test for several other companies located both in Canada and the USA. I do not desire to own a tackleshop for that would interfere with my time on the water.  Bill Davies and Family own and operate WALLY'S BAIT & TACKLE SHOP on Sandwich Street in Windsor. If you haven't been there in awhile you should stop in and take a look at their new facelift for the store and some of their new items for 2007. The Davies family is a fine wholesome family and been in the business for a number of years and hopefully many more and they do not deserve this type of business distraction or bad rumor.  Thank You for all your Indulgence in this post!"

19574,Rich,2007-01-06 04:42:00,3927,"Whew, glad you put that rumour to rest"
19576,douG,2007-01-06 04:43:00,2693,"As Zack says, ""That's really random""."
19578,danc,2007-01-06 04:50:00,4677,"For the record, I didn't buy Wally out either. In case you were wondering."
19608,cisco,2007-01-06 06:09:00,597,Shame on you Terry! That's spam! You're only trying to promote your pal Ron's business! LOL!
19609,Crazyhook,2007-01-06 06:16:00,1154,stop it before its started I say
19630,Carp,2007-01-06 07:48:00,1488,"  Yup, me too. I was really thinking about it, but operating the shop would take too much time away from fishing, so I retracted the bid I was almost going to make. Glad I have my priorities straightened out.  Go fishing or work ? HMMMM !!!"
19663,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-06 13:39:00,0,Wait a minute does this mean it's for sale?  I'm going to my secret stash and start counting my pennies and put in an offer.
19751,glen,2007-01-06 18:07:00,2641,My cousin owned a fishing shop and the hours sucked.  He sold it after a few years.  People wanted bait 24/7.
20017,SNAGMAN,2007-01-07 20:08:00,2,I apologize to anyone and to this site who may have thought this post was a cheap shot at advertising or a spam for the business I mentioned. The rumor was real and was distracting for the business and it was just that a rumor. That I felt should be addressed.  Thanks for your indulgence its much appreciated.
