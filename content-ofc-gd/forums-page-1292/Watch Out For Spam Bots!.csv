I saw four fishing sites today alone that had been slammed by spam/porn bots. We have a very small modification to our registration process that has kept them at bay so far, but if they do get past it, please report the bots immediately. Don't click on any links they put up if they get in cause I can pretty much guarantee you it will dump some nasty cookies on your computer."
