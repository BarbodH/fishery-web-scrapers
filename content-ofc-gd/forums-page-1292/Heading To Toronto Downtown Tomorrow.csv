19534,Steelcat,2007-01-06 02:19:00,191,"My bro, my father, and I am going to Toronto Downtown for some rare January fishing. Anyone went there today with +11c temperature?  How was the fishing? We are still thinking if we should just stick around the lake front or head to Toronto Island Any suggestion?"
19535,Clampet,2007-01-06 02:24:00,1947,"Urban Angler is the man to speak with. He goes to the Toronto Islands on a regular basis with some success catching Pike. He gets there via the ferry accessed from the foot of Bay street, that leaves around 5:45 AM."
19536,urbanangler1990,2007-01-06 02:42:00,933,"i went out today between 10 30 till about 2 pm with no luck, i think it wouldve been best if we got some southern wind to push em pike inot the marinas. Both places are great, either islands or waterfront. u can start from ontario place through to spadina and further east. Best of luck, i hope u get inot some!    Stress the word SOME   fisheadric is a pro, along with snag, highdrifter, dsn, they know theyre stuff as well, btw where ya been Ric? havent heard much from ya lately. thnx"
19545,Steelcat,2007-01-06 03:03:00,191,"Thank you both for the tips  I'll try to fish at the waterfront tomorrow then   Even if there's no fish, it's already something special fishing soft water in Canadian January~!"
19648,dsn,2007-01-06 12:27:00,1018,  urbanangler thanks for including me in but I 've been skunked bad so far. But still in the game. Just happens to run into SNAG everywhere I go.  Thats how I get mentioned into the posts.   You never seen me post any fish in TO for along time.  Like I said thanks again dsn
19728,Steelcat,2007-01-06 17:23:00,191,We have decided to go fishing tomorrow rather than today. Partly because of the wet weather (suppose to be over by now that's why I never fully trust weather network). But tomorrow looks kind of cold~ but still it's January soft water fishing
19732,urbanangler1990,2007-01-06 17:31:00,933," yea tomorrow looks better, at least no rain   dsn"
19734,FishFinder,2007-01-06 17:35:00,481,"Urban Angler have you caught any Pike from The islands latley, i saw you posting a few time that you were heading out, did ya get any?"
