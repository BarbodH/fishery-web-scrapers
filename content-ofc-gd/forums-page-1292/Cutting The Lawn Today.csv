19431,Clampet,2007-01-05 21:54:00,1947,"Yes, I noticed the grass growing between the interlocking stones, nice green color, real healthy!"
19439,woodro,2007-01-05 22:26:00,168,"tell me about it, just picked up a new sled and a 3man clam for the season, but it doesnt look to promising"
19446,setomonkey,2007-01-05 22:38:00,872,"There are some green shoots appearing in our garden, they are in for a real surprise if/when it gets cold...  Mike"
19482,Garyv,2007-01-06 00:10:00,547,We took down about 75 Ash trees at the campground I work and volunteer at.  About 85% of them had buds on the tops.  Considering I plough snow it looks like I may also be cutting grass instead this year.
19485,Bernie,2007-01-06 00:18:00,3190,Pussy willows are out around here.. Incredible!
19500,Daplumma,2007-01-06 00:44:00,1961,"My goats have been eating real grass this year instead of hay for the most part..Very wierd!Going up to 72 tomorrow,thats got to be at least 27 litres Canadian!eh? Joe"
19618,OhioFisherman,2007-01-06 06:36:00,6623,"Like 60 degrees here today and monsoon season, more rain than I have seen for a few years. LOL glad it wasn`t snow!"
19642,Carp,2007-01-06 09:20:00,1488,"Hey Bob,  Just be thankful all this rain in the past couple of month's isn't snow or we'd be breaking other records (and our backs) rather than just record warm temps.  Giving the lawn a trim is peanuts compared to the alternative.  Ice may not be here for quite a while. Last year, we didn't get our hut on the lake. Good ice (for our hut) only the last couple of weeks of the season at Oro Station. I'm praying for record cold temps to offset the warm spell.....and the sooner, the better."
19671,Rich Clemens,2007-01-06 13:52:00,3131,60 here in central PA today.  I went outside early this am in a T-shirt and was comfortable.  Pretty cool the furnace ain't running much now.    Maybe winter will start in late January or February and run through April ... just off a little this year.
19737,fishindevil,2007-01-06 17:38:00,6254,"i also heard that some people near london ontario have seen robins pulling dew worms out   of the ground,it was in their local paper or something like that,i cant imagine the robins coming back already if we get a real cold snap they will prob,die  ...i cant believe it"
19763,hawkeye,2007-01-06 19:42:00,162,"You don't fool mother nature, we're gonna pay for this. Saw on the weather chanel yesterday that they are looking for much much much colder weather later this month, but looking at the 14 day long range It goes below freezing on the 15th and stays there out to the 20th. Best it can do is a paultry -6C"
19956,Rich,2007-01-07 16:20:00,3927,Sleded caught a largemouth yesterday on his pickerel rig. Full of eggs.
