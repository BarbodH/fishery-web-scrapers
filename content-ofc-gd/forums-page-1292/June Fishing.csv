Hows the fishing up there. It would be our first time up there. We have gone to the Gowganda/Gogoma area for the last 7 years and are thinking of a change.  Thanks,"

Hawk Air  Only drive-to I've been to up in that ""area"" is Five Mile Lake (S. of Chapleau) off of Hwy. 129. Camped 1 year and stayed in a cabin the other. Good fishing for Walleye & Smallies, Pike were OK, but a lot of hammer handles.  Five Mile Lake Lodge  Here's another link to check out.  From TJ's site, and it lists several camps in the Wawa / Chapleau area.  Good luck and welcome to the OFC!  dk"
19250,pigeonfisher,2007-01-05 13:48:00,696,I drove through a couple of camps just East of Hawk Junction one winter as I was passing through.  If I recall 30 or four of'em up there.   Two are almost right on the highway.
19781,Green,2007-01-06 20:39:00,20,Thanks guys. I'll do some homework on the lodges up there. I was part of the old board but I guess my profile was not carried over.  Thanks anyways.  Gary

Like everyone you had to reregister here and if you wanted your old post count added you need to know it, or a close estimate, and ask a moderator to fix your post counter.  As for Hawk Junction...can't help you there...never fished the area."
