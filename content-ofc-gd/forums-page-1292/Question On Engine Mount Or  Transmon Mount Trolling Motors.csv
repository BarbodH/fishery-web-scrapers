19744,cantermore,2007-01-06 17:48:00,49,"Hi  Has anyone here ever used the engine mount electric trolling motors like this: http://www.minnkotamotors.com/products/mot...tail.asp?pg=fem      or the Lenco  http://www.lencomarine.com/lencodrivetrolli.html  or anything similar  These types or electric motors are my only options...  I would love to get some feedback if anyone is using them  Thanks, Johnny"
19757,GbayGiant,2007-01-06 19:04:00,1780,"Why is it your only option ? If it is, my friend put one on his pontoon boat, I would say it's similar to a transome mount and worked well, but bow mounts have alot more control if you can jimmy something up."
19762,cantermore,2007-01-06 19:38:00,49,"Its going on Hurricane deck boat with a deep V hull, no rooom at the front..."
19767,GbayGiant,2007-01-06 19:53:00,1780,"I think you will like it then, we had no problems the day we fished with one, he had the minnkota version, the other one looks though if you would rather have foot control."
19773,fishindevil,2007-01-06 20:14:00,6254,"some of the profesional walleye anglers that fish pro tournaments use those motors in the states,and they say that they work great,its for fishing really rough conditions as the electric trolling motors on the front come out of the water alot and the ones they mount on the big engines dont,these walleye guys fish alot of mid-western open resvoirs,in north dakota and nebraska and they commonly fish in 5-8ft.waves on these huge man made lakes and thats why they use them ...   cheers"
19804,Bob Devine,2007-01-06 23:26:00,251,"I use the EM MK and think it is great. Primarily use it for crawler harness fishing for walleyes. As I don't like to troll into the wind the EM works great. Battery life depends on the condition of your batteries but you will definitely get a day of fishing using this great idea. It is also a vauable tool for a stealth approach for  trolling shallow or at night.  Good luck with your decision,"
19808,cantermore,2007-01-06 23:46:00,49,My initial fears on the Minn Kota is I have to use the steering on the Alpha drive (its an I/O boat) and I dont think I will be able to turn that steering wheel easily with the main engine off; but I have never tried it.  Johnny
