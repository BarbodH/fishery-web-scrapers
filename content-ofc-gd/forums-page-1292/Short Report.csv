Eventually we figured out that bread balls worked pretty well for bluegill. Only one keeper perch caught all day but quite a few bluegills to keep us occupied. No pike however.    "

19610,xrap,2007-01-06 06:21:00,683,"Nice report and pics Rich. Those blue gills really have some nice coulors. Also, I was wondering how do you clean blue gills. Because if we ever get some ice this year, I was thinking of going to Valens for some blue gills. And also, what size range is considered a keeper?"
19644,Carp,2007-01-06 09:29:00,1488,"Good luck with the fishing tomorrow...er....today......um......whenever. DANG ! I have to get to bed. Crap, it's 4:30 am Kiddies will be up in a couple of hours.  Post a report with some more pics Rich.  tight lines"
