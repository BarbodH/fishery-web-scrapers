So I got over to let it in, luckily I stopped it though, because somehow the dog had run off somewhere and came back with a severed moose leg in her mouth, and she's looking up at me and wagging her tail as if she's saying ""oh boy oh boy oh boy look what I brought home"". And yeah, just thought I'd let everyone know because it was really random."
19522,fishergirl72,2007-01-06 01:51:00,455,"Wow, that was an unpleasent surprise!  And I can understand why you posted this, it is not everyday that a dog comes home with a severed moose leg in it's mouth."
19526,pameladallaire,2007-01-06 02:03:00,470,"Hmm, you've never had a dog retrieve a skunk?  You are lucky with the moose leg!!  Pam"
19528,motv8tr,2007-01-06 02:06:00,2587,"Aww heck, I give my dogs deer legs all the time....as Pam said, much better than a skunk  Maureen"

19547,Rich,2007-01-06 03:07:00,3927,That was a gift ! A gift for the family!
19569,Peter Panfish,2007-01-06 04:06:00,46,"Haha, it definately wasn't sawn (sawed? sawn?) off by some hunter, looks more like it fell off, and a skunk... dead skunk isn't fun, I'm glad we don't get many of them up here."
