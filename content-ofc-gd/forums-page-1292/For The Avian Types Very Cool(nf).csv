19359,nautifish,2007-01-05 18:43:00,1416,That is a Golden eagle those birds of prey are huge. Make my MaCaw look like a budgie.  I kept birds of prey for allmost six yrs back in the UK used to help out a local birds of prey rescue. They are awesome birds so much power & majestic at the same time. That really is a neat shot.
19361,Raf,2007-01-05 18:45:00,3495,awesome shot
19362,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-05 18:47:00,0,"  Very, Very Cool indeed.  Thanks Peter.  Just saved a copy of that baby."
19366,tonyb,2007-01-05 18:52:00,1637,Is that real!?  I know those golden's are big but it makes that canid look like the size of a bunny!  Tony
19369,nautifish,2007-01-05 19:00:00,1416,"The golden eagle is in   Size - Length of about 3 feet (.92m). Weighing up to 15 pounds (7kg), with a wing span of up to 7 feet (2m). Being a great hunter, the golden eagle seldom eats carrion. Its hunting territory extends up to 162 square miles (260 square km). Diet - Groundhogs, marmots, foxes, skunks, cats, rabbits, grouse, ground squirrels, crows, pheasants, meadowlarks, tortoises, and snakes."
19402,GbayGiant,2007-01-05 20:41:00,1780,"Amazing shot, 15lbs with power like that, WOW."
19404,Clampet,2007-01-05 20:48:00,1947,"And a red Fox.  The other bird looks like either a MagPie, but I'm guessing a Whisky Jack."
19435,pikehunter,2007-01-05 22:09:00,1659,Can you imagine having that bird in your house like a pet budgie?
19436,Carp,2007-01-05 22:17:00,1488,Awesome shot.  I love watching those large birds in action. Lots of bald eagles in the area I moose hunt. I could watch them all day.
19447,nautifish,2007-01-05 22:38:00,1416,Little trivia for ya.  Did ya know that a group of  Golden eagles is infact called a > Kettle of eagles.  Did you also know that  the golden eagle can reach speeds from 200 to 320 km/h when diving.  Pretty incredible huh!
19459,Bernie,2007-01-05 23:09:00,3190,This past summer behind my cottage an osprey and a heron battled over a small pike. The heron ended up with the fish. I would have bet on the osprey beforehand. We also have bald eagles nesting a kilometer away for the last several years.They are huge.
19518,Tacklebuster,2007-01-06 01:40:00,303,"I had to save that pic too, great shot."
19519,bigfish1965,2007-01-06 01:43:00,3382,Cool image...not real..but cool anyway.
19533,pameladallaire,2007-01-06 02:14:00,470,Up here the Ravens fight cats over garbage.  Neither win.
19649,Burtess,2007-01-06 12:41:00,901," Yeah, I think this is a Photoshop creation as well....."
19667,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-06 13:47:00,0,"A few years ago some lady almost lost her dog to a grey owl, lucky for her the dog was chained down . :-)"
19761,GbayGiant,2007-01-06 19:38:00,1780,"It looks real to me, if it is photoshop they did a nice job. I think it's something that could take place in nature anyway."
19769,fishindevil,2007-01-06 20:10:00,6254,well if its real or photoshop its still a really cool picture for sure  cheers
19879,danc,2007-01-07 03:23:00,4677,It certainly looks real to me. Why would anyone claim that it's not real? Snopes seems to agree with me.
19881,Burtess,2007-01-07 03:30:00,901,"  You are correct DanC, Snopes does not lie!  Check out the series of photos taken buy the Finnish photographer, wild....  Burt"
19884,danc,2007-01-07 03:39:00,4677,  Wow. Thanks Burtess. I hadn't checked that link out. That pretty much seals the deal I'd say. The photos are as real as they come. Here's the LINK to the rest of the photos in the series.
19920,GbayGiant,2007-01-07 06:57:00,1780,"Thanks for the link Dan, those are amazing shots for sure. I bet the photographer got paid $50,000 tops from national geographic or something for this once in a lifetime shot, but the paparazzi gets a million for a lazy shot of Paris Hilton."
