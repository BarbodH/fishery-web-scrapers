19835,Carp,2007-01-07 02:01:00,1488,"Not sure of the winter hours.  I've only been once. Smaller trout were in the first pond. The rear pond had larger trout, some 10lb. bows in there, but it's been quite a few years. If I remember correctly, there's been an ownership change recently.  Let us know how you do.  Good luck"
19838,Joey,2007-01-07 02:07:00,9122,"I took my son there when we first moved back here.  Like Carp said, small trout in the first pond, and larger ones in the back pond.  There were also salmon in the back pond when we went.  You pay by inches/lbs so be forwarned, and no releases!!  Joey"
