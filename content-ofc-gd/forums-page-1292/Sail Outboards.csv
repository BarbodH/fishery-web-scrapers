Maybe they are under license or maybe they are a rip-off? If I was going to buy one then I'd probably go with a 4 stroke if it was indeed the same as a new Yamaha.  I do know that their 2.5hp Gull Outboard counterparts have a bad reputation.  I'd be leary since there isn't much of a dealer network and they are made in mainland China. If I was going to dump that kind of money into a new motor I'd get something with a good track record and dealer/parts network. Its not much of a deal if you can't get parts and service easily.   Ningbo YongWang Motorboat Co. Ltd is the parent company."
19765,Bernie,2007-01-06 19:49:00,3190,If someone asks me about a product such as that or an old worn or poorly maintained motor I ask how far out on the water they generally go or if they keep a good set of oars.
