19498,Daplumma,2007-01-06 00:42:00,1961,Some of them southern boys have more than a few skeeters and the alligators will kick a black fly's butt any day of the week.
19525,fishergirl72,2007-01-06 02:00:00,455,"I am the same here Pam, just louder in person!  Just ask anybody from the xmas swill, and I look different in person than in photos"
19577,douG,2007-01-06 04:48:00,2693,"Attaboy, Bunk.  Puckhead has it to rights also.  However, like Wayne says, does this guy prefer to cast or troll?  Inquiring minds want to know."
19616,OhioFisherman,2007-01-06 06:32:00,6623,"Big difference between a message board post and real life, I got to fish with them before I decide. Some people are great but not in a boat."

19725,POLLIWOGG,2007-01-06 17:16:00,835,"Can't stand those power casters, the guys that have to get out a couple more feet and don't care if your left eye or half your face goes with it. only troll with a newbie on board."
19726,Carp,2007-01-06 17:20:00,1488,"    Hey, the southern folk are more than welcome to take on our northern swamps infested with fist size black flies and golf ball size skeeters. Alligators....hmmmm ? Hard to miss swatting a gator, but impossible to swat all the flying buggers."

19772,ChrisK,2007-01-06 20:12:00,2772,I'm thinkin we are pretty much done with this thread.....
19197,fishforfun,2007-01-05 03:47:00,105,"Interesting post, when do you want to go fishing?"
19198,Joey,2007-01-05 03:57:00,9122,Is that you Canadave    This seems all so political and stuff  Just teasin ya.  Why don't you go fishing with the people you don't think you'd like and see if your intuition is true?  Maybe you'll just end up liking them.  I haven't fished with anyone on this board that I didn't end up being good friends with.  Joey
19204,snag,2007-01-05 04:22:00,1932," It's O.K Joey,  He'll be nice to you. He doesn't discriminate against coolers!   YET!  I don't have a boat, will he hate my poor shoes?"
19240,BITEME,2007-01-05 13:34:00,1969,WHAT  EVER!!!!!!!!!!  what the heck I was biting my tongue but I cant let this pass I will fish with anyone anytime anyplace anywhere once and hopefully again and again after reading your little ditty I'll throw you an anchor  Peter
19248,John,2007-01-05 13:47:00,2956,"You know, I don't get to fish anywhere near as much as I would like as work keeps me travelling. So, I have not invested in a boat just to have it sit in the garage. The benefit of not owning a boat, at least for me, is getting to scrounge rides from some of the great people that make up this OFC world of ours. I have fished with quite a number of OFC'rs and have not found one, (maybe with the exception of the pink tu-tu guy), that I would not fish with again given the opportunity. We all have quirks, ideosyncracies and god forbid personalities. Don't judge us by our covers, you will miss out on some great times.  By the way, I need a ride at Lakair this year...................  John..."
19259,dustink,2007-01-05 14:04:00,526,"   Yep....and I have a couple of guys who are ""friends"" but after a fishing trip.....we're still friends, we just don't fish together!"

19309,John,2007-01-05 16:11:00,2956,  Many of us can attest to that............

19353,Kirk,2007-01-05 18:19:00,347,I don't fish with anyone that takes 4 years to realize anything.
19356,nautifish,2007-01-05 18:41:00,1416,  LMDAO!!!!! OHHHH THAT WAS GOOD.  Me i am just as crazy in real life as i am on the net.........But lovable with it.
19383,Rich,2007-01-05 19:47:00,3927,Yes I can attest that Nauti is just as crazy in real life as online.. perhaps more so!
19384,nautifish,2007-01-05 19:48:00,1416,  Errmmm excuse me but u left out the lovable too you brat!  SLAP!!!!
19387,Garyv,2007-01-05 19:55:00,547,Am I suppose to care what this person thinks?
19389,nautifish,2007-01-05 19:57:00,1416,  Not really!
19443,Puckhead,2007-01-05 22:32:00,377,"Come on man, it's a message board....  I couldn't count how many times I've put my foot in my mouth on OFC just because my dry sense of humour never seems to come out properly in print...  How could you possibly tell how a person could be by some posts on a message board??  If I say ""go screw yourself"".  Could be a joke, could be an insult, I could be talking about changing a lightbulb.  Remove the body language and context and you have no idea what I'm saying...  Trust me, It's come out all too wrong for me a couple of times on this board so I know from personal experience that your analogy is nonesense.."
19448,camillj,2007-01-05 22:43:00,1988,Time for a big OFC group hug  Let nobody dare to 'dis' one of our clan ... that the musky gods frown forever on his offerings .. and the trout gods make his roe stink like owldroppings ... and even the rock bass (king of all sportfish) turn up their noses at his worm.

19451,Joey,2007-01-05 22:59:00,9122,It would appear he's just been fishing with all of us  Guess we don't need to take him now  Joey
19460,Roy,2007-01-05 23:11:00,13728," That doesn't sound too bad to me. Although, had I written that sentence, it would have been ""After more than 4 years of reading peoples' posts on this board, I find it interesting that I think I can tell with reading 2 or 3 posts from someone, that I would love to spend a day fishing with them in MY  boat."
19479,Moosebunk,2007-01-06 00:04:00,3970,"Ya fish in my boat it likely means you're going to have to stay in my teepee a couple days, play with my kids, make nice with my woman, and smoke sweet grass ti'll yer left lung gives out.  You better be what you are online cause there's alot of bugs outside the comfort of my door.  I choose wisely and have done so so far."
19487,Joey,2007-01-06 00:21:00,9122," Hahaha, great saying MB.  Paul always says that if they have the show Survivor in Canada, they should have it up north in the spring, then you'll tell the real survivors from the wusses when the mosquitos and blackflies come out.  It would probably be a short show, unless Canadians were in it.  Joey"
19107,outahere,2007-01-04 23:22:00,6,"After more than 4 years of reading peoples' posts on this board, I find it interesting that I think I can tell with reading 2 or 3 posts from someone, that I would love to spend a day fishing with them in their boat.  And then there are others that I don't think I would get in their boat if mine just sank right beside them. What an interesting cross section of people that like to fish."
19110,Pigeontroller,2007-01-04 23:28:00,2793,Good thing we know so much about you...
19111,Rich,2007-01-04 23:29:00,3927,You dont truly know anybody until you've actually fished with them. I always make it a rule not to judge a book by its cover. I guess thats just me though.
19114,The Urban Fisherman,2007-01-04 23:33:00,2050,"Good rule Rich!  Also, some people act much different on the internet.  The quietest, shyest person in the world might be the biggest ""smack talker"" on OFC! haha  uf"
19116,mason05,2007-01-04 23:48:00,258,Well said Pigeon.  Weird post Outahere.  I'm not sure I'd want you in my boat.....LOL  Corn Nug

19126,Bernie,2007-01-05 00:02:00,3190, Wish it was my boat!
19132,irishfield,2007-01-05 00:19:00,26272,Does it matter if they cast or do you prefer to Troll?
19133,Terry,2007-01-05 00:20:00,14456,I wait till 6 post to decide.......lol
19134,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-05 00:26:00,0,An internet personlaity can be 100% diffferent then real life. I'm sure we all know someone that is completly different in real life then on the net.
19135,bpsbassman,2007-01-05 00:28:00,941,.....................................Or one day in a boat!! I've spent a day in a boat with a stranger and sometimes know more about him than some of his friends.
