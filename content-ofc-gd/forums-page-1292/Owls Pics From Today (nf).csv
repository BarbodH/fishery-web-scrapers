19832,Ron,2007-01-07 01:47:00,1683,"Thanks for giving me an excuse to get out and look for Owls Pam.  I/we got 6 Snowy, 15 Longear, 1 Shortear and 2 Saw-Whets. Well over 2 dozen Red Tailed Hawks, a dozen or more Rough Legged Hawks, a generous amount of Harris Hawks, 3 Kestrals, 1 Ringed Neck Pheasent and a bonus Bald Eagle. So yes, I had a GREAT day!               "
19840,Joey,2007-01-07 02:08:00,9122,"Awesome shots Ron.  How the heck to you find them there owls, well, aside from the white one, which is obvious?  Joey"
19845,irishfield,2007-01-07 02:13:00,26272,Great stuff Ron. Great to know a guy that's always out scouting hOOters for us! LOL
19856,Carp,2007-01-07 02:24:00,1488,AMEN !!!  
19860,trapshooter,2007-01-07 02:31:00,1234,Awesome pics Ron!  What a great day.
19861,Carp,2007-01-07 02:35:00,1488,Awesome shots Ron.  How the heck do you see those buggers in the trees ? They seem to blend in so well. Thats a heck of a lot of birds to spot in one outing.
19863,Bernie,2007-01-07 02:40:00,3190,"Since I joined this forum almost a month ago, everyday it seems I am impressed with the talent and knowledge that appears here. To track and photograph these beautiful birds is no easy task. Very good Ron."
19867,pameladallaire,2007-01-07 03:01:00,470,"What a great end to a sick day for me.  Thanx Ron.  You cheered me up.  I just realized that this was the Timmins day for xmas bird count and I forgot because I was sick.  Oh well, I'm amazed you found so many owls in one day.  You know your birds Ron.  Pam"
19875,Terry,2007-01-07 03:19:00,14456,wow  I have no idea how the heck you find them
19882,danc,2007-01-07 03:33:00,4677,"While camped in the middle of nowhere last summer with Ron, I heard an odd ""beep, beep, beep"" sound in the darkness of the night. I was sure that it was a back up alarm on a commercial vehicle of some sort. I thought it was strange that such a vehicle would be working in the middle of nowhere at night. I asked Ron if he heard the sound. He had heard it all right. But he quickly informed me that it was the call of a ""Back up alarm Owl??"". I think that's what he called it. Ron?? I thought that he was pulling my leg. Anyways, we later heard several more coming from different directions that were apparently calling to each other. The guy knows his Owls. And he knows how to use his camera too. Great job Bud.."
19896,Greencoachdog,2007-01-07 04:01:00,8163,"The Owl in the 5th pic looks like he's sayin' ""Are You Talkin' to Me???"""
19898,fishindevil,2007-01-07 04:08:00,6254,"very nice pics,those owls are such a majestic bird of stealth,and great hunters congrats"
19904,Mike the Pike,2007-01-07 04:29:00,3421,Nice shots.Start Painting Pam
19919,GbayGiant,2007-01-07 06:42:00,1780,"Wow, you must have a good eye Ron, the only time I see owls is by accident when they fly out in the open."
19960,pameladallaire,2007-01-07 16:31:00,470,"I'll start painting as soon as I stop feeling shaky.  WHEN I get my new camera, I hope to catch a shot of our Great Grey, and Great Horned owls.  But with me it's, if you see it, the camera isn't within reach.  Ron must have his camera glued to his hand.  Pam"
20005,Whopper,2007-01-07 19:16:00,2174,"Great shots Ron, been out looking for owls, hawks and cardinals lately. Haven't spotted any owls but I seen a lot of hawks and redbirds.  Whopper"
20008,crappiesteve,2007-01-07 19:27:00,220,"Fantastic shots Ron,as usual  Steve"
20028,Ron,2007-01-07 20:52:00,1683,"Thanks for the compliments peoples.  DanC, I remember that night! I heard the little buggers all week and didn't pay any attention to them at all, not until you made a comment about it.  What we heard was the ""back up beacon call"" from a Saw-Whet Owl. It is one of their primary calls during the breeding season.  All of these birds were seen on Amhearst Island. Just like fishing, get away from the ""hot spots"" and do a little searching away from the crowd. Finding the Saw-Whets were the biggest challange. These Owls are teh size of a Robin, now picture trying to find that in a Bush thick as the hair on a back of a dog.  Not an easy task but well worth it with the reward of a few pictures.  The above pictures 4 and 5 are the same bird. Once I got the camera set up on the Tripod, my friend moved a little and stepped on a puddle making the Saw-Whet change his pose, kinda funny I thought.  Majority of the time we are looking for signs of the Owls ie: white wash and pellets. We found one spot where the Long Ears were roosting and would see anywhere's from 3 to 20 pellets under one tree, this is a good indicator of their haunt!  I should actually start taking picures zoomed out just to give an idea of how difficult these guys are to see.    "
20059,pameladallaire,2007-01-07 21:49:00,470,Cool Ron.
