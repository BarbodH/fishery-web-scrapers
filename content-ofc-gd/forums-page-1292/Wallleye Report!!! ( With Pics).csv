19990,woodro,2007-01-07 18:10:00,168,"nice!! my dad and i were out the same morning, perfect walleye weather, over cast, nice chop on the and can't forget about the rain and drizzle hittin the face while running the boat at 30mph lol"
19991,Cookslav,2007-01-07 18:10:00,1457,"nice job,  Another PB on Quinte...what a great(extended) season! Cheers,"
19588,Crazyhook,2007-01-06 05:16:00,1154,"What a day!!! headed down to the Bay of Quinte to meet A and Sheldon Hatch ( eye tracker). It rained all night in Ottawa and I was expecting a tough day.  My morning started with a trip to the gas station ( fill up and a box of my favorite donuts ).  I was not feeling the greatest and saw my coffee hit the windshield just before Kingston ( why the heck are the wipers not on the inside!) Hlf a bottle of Pepto I feel alright and I meet the lads at the dock. We launch in Picton and start trolling.  We did not have the second rod in when we get bit. I reel in the first fish of the day a nice little 3 pounder ( which will be tomorrows dinner)  A gets the next fish, his first walleye and what a way to break a cherry, a fat 29"" 10 pounder!  We were marking fish all over the place ( I thought the finder was on demo mode)..  the far planer board start swimming off and I come tight. The battle was on. Some large head shakes I knew I was in for a nice one... sure enough my biggest eye ever comes in 30 x 18! ( did not weight it...)  what a beauty day on the water. We finished 3 for 4 ( one nice fish came off on our last pass of the day)  Thanks so much to Sheldon for the day on the water an for breaking a cherry and crushing my personal best. Looks like I have found another fish with teeth to dream about  UNreal, fishing in January without drilling a hole and not wearing a jacket for half the day!"

19656,Clampet,2007-01-06 13:28:00,1947,Good to hear you did not get skunked. It must be something to see the fish finder loaded with fish.  That must get your hopes up!

19700,duber,2007-01-06 15:24:00,220,Good catch CH!  I knew the wallys were in trouble when I heard you were coming to town!
19706,Moosebunk,2007-01-06 15:51:00,3970,WTG man.  Fishing with Sheldon is a real treat as there aren't many if any that have a handle on walleye like that guy.  Did you enjoy the ride in the Stealth Bomber???
19710,fishboy,2007-01-06 16:16:00,550,Nice work-congrats & thanks for the pics.
