I purchased a 18 foot starcraft futura last summer, it weighs about 2000 pounds with the motor. Just wondering what size of kicker motor I should go with and how would you mount it so that it can be steered by the steering wheel/115 mercury opti-max. Would you pay someone to professionaly install the steering arm?  Thanks for your help again,  Bing"
