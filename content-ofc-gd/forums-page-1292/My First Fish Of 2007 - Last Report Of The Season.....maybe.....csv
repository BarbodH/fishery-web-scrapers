19582,ccmtcanada,2007-01-06 05:02:00,7971,"With the great temps, blyght and I HAD to go out tonight....even though it was raining.  It was a nice 11C while we were out there....no wind to speak of, no waves and nice green water with plenty of bait fish swimming around.  We were in touch with fishindevil, so we hooked up.  We were trying to land some more Walleye, but it was not to be!  A few hours into fishing I pulled this pike out of the water....a 32"", 14.5"" girth, 8 lb 3oz toothy critter.      The blood on my left hand isn't the pike's....he got me....and pretty good too!  It bled for quite a while and luckily fishindevil had some kleenex so I could apply some pressure to it...stopped bleeding after about 10 minutes.     He took the lure very deep and it took a while to get it out, but after about 10 minutes, he swam away....for me to catch another day!"
