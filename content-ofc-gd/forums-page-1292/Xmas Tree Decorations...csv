10917,Terry,2006-12-11 16:10:00,14456,"do you have a cat  we did the same thing about 8 years ago..very cool  till the cat climbed in the tree got stuck by a hook and while jumping in pain got hooked 5 more times...blood all over the presents have you ever tried to catch a cat with 6 hooks in it, I was going to use a jig and flipping stick to catch it, figured one more hook wouldn't hurt....well the wife grabbed it by the williams wobbler and off to the vet and the lady at the vet office wanted us charged with cruelty to animals   but it looked cool"
10929,Monique,2006-12-11 16:45:00,29,"I came up with this ideal to LURE T.J. into helping with the tree this year.    Yes we do have 2 cats, they are both over 15lbs. and don't fit under the tree.  However we made sure not to put lures on the bottom branches.  It turned out pretty cool, and when the time comes to put the lures away, T.J.'s tackle box will be in order for Spring Fishing.  I thought putting the Santa hat on the muskie was a bonus since the muskie lures were to heavy for the tree.  Kids had fun decorating the tree, remembering which lure caught what fish this past summer.  Maybe next year I'll come up with a hunting theme"
10932,Headhunter,2006-12-11 16:47:00,5703,"LOL Terry! ""grabbed it by the Williams Wobbler""!!! HH"
10950,Terry,2006-12-11 18:01:00,14456,"well thank god it wasn't a williams white fish spoon, they have the extra hooks on the side and the wife would have been hooked too"
10961,Roy,2006-12-11 19:04:00,13728,Nothing says Christmas like a flat screen fireplace.....
10985,TJQ,2006-12-11 20:41:00,7806," I was waiting for that... actually wondering why it took so long... hey... it doesnt give off much heat, but ya never have to put any wood in it   hahahahahaha!!!!!!"
10987,bpsbassman,2006-12-11 20:48:00,941,Too funny Terry
19810,mason05,2007-01-07 00:17:00,258,"TJ, I like the looks of the wood burned bear paddle on the wall in the last pic.  Do you know of any members on this board that make custom burns on a paddle?  I'd love to get mine done before the next Algonquin mission.  Cheers  Corn Nug"

10471,TJQ,2006-12-10 15:26:00,7806,This year we ... well actually Monique thought it would be neat to do something different with the xmas tree. ...  I wanst sure it was gonna be nice at first... but hey .. I think it Turned out pretty good...    Im sure there is pleny of sunkken pine trees that look like this... lol    A little brighter...    We even have a nice roaring fire in the fireplace...    Half my tacklebox.. right there....    Pretty cool in the dark...    Even the muskies in the xmas mood...    The xmas corner....    Moniques village... every year she and the kids pick out another house...  I think.. ill even turn this into a neat contest... guess how many lures are snagged in the tree!!!  (Coming soon!!)
10472,Bly,2006-12-10 15:30:00,1556,Absolutely fantastic TJ!!!!   Love it!   What a great idea!   Good work Monique!!  Thanks for sharing.  blyght
10480,snackpack5150,2006-12-10 15:45:00,79,"Well done, very neat  thanks for the idea.. gives me a great reason to get more lures!!!!!!   Thanks for sharing   Have a safe and happy christmas!!!! Ken"
10481,TJQ,2006-12-10 15:47:00,7806,Heres the link to the contest...  Xmas Tree Contest - CLICK HERE!!
10484,Carp,2006-12-10 15:48:00,1488,That's a great idea. Looks great and right in line with your lifestyle. I don't think I'd ever do it though. Don't feel like putting away all the lures when the tree comes down.
10489,TJQ,2006-12-10 15:56:00,7806,   Ummm thats one of the large list of reasons I had kids.....  Besides.. its fun to watch when they poke themselves...  
10490,Joey,2006-12-10 16:00:00,9122,"You guys are fishing freaks for sure - I love it.  Looks good TJ, Monique, Jaden and Avery.  Well done  Joey"
10497,trapshooter,2006-12-10 16:07:00,1234,"I love what you've got on the TV.  I've had that tape for 10 years.  The best part is when the logs kind settle and fall a bit.  Watch for it.  Oh yeah, sweet tree too."
10511,lew,2006-12-10 16:22:00,12767,Lookin good TJ and nice to see the Magnum Jumla front & center

10522,ChrisK,2006-12-10 16:44:00,2772,Nice tree TJ....Love the muskie and the Christmas Village too.....I take it you do not have any kitty cats in the household ??   Seasons Greetings
10525,Blake,2006-12-10 16:51:00,418,"That brings a a big smile for me.  What a great idea for Xmas.  The house looks like a HOME in all senses of the would.  Great job TJ, Monique, Jaden and Avery."
10535,Ron,2006-12-10 17:00:00,1683,"Kewl,  Kinda gives me mixed feelings though, Chritsmas or Fishing season!"
10548,tjsa,2006-12-10 17:15:00,1578,"Nice, although I would have to use the 36 ft. red pine in my front yard to hold all of my tackle bought over the years, lol."
10552,b2kptbo,2006-12-10 17:21:00,1505,"Very nicely done, looks beauty..."

10673,setomonkey,2006-12-10 23:08:00,872,"Great idea, and a good reason to reorganize your tackle when you have to take them all down...    Mike"
