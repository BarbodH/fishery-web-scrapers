19307,fishing n autograph,2007-01-05 16:08:00,2540,"Hey Guys,  It's unfortunate that I have not been around for a while and haven't been out fishing since about August or September. Since December I've been in training with the York Regional Police, and now, I'm off to the Ontario Police College on Sunday night for the next 3 months.  A lot of things will be tested while I'm there, Including 3 months apart from my beautiful expecting wife. It'll tough, but I know it'll be worth it in the end.  I'll check the board when I can, but for those who are fishin on the ice, take care, play safe and for goodness sake don't do anything stupid....stupidity kills more people than alcohol!  Take Care   Dave"
