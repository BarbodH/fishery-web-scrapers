19160,fishbait,2007-01-05 01:57:00,23,How's the weather been up around Little Vermillion and Nungasser?  are we looking at an early spring?
19175,danc,2007-01-05 02:40:00,4677,"They are booking tee off times next week, although a few of the greens are a little soggy yet."
19187,ccmtcanada,2007-01-05 03:27:00,7971,My poor tree in the front yard is starting to bud already!!!!
19192,irishfield,2007-01-05 03:36:00,26272,Leah's roses are in full bloom in the front garden! Great weather for hauling logs and splitting firewood...but I'm sure not getting an value out of my ski pass at Blue!
19193,tjsa,2007-01-05 03:37:00,1578," LOL, Dan, probably not true for where he was asking, but here in town, they could be still playing winter greens for sure.  If we do not get any significant snowfall, and colder weather, some people are probably gonna be fishing for walleye in boats before the season closes for the spawning time."
19297,fishbait,2007-01-05 15:45:00,23,That means the spawn will be early and the big fish will be moving out.  Nothing like more of a challenge.
19344,pameladallaire,2007-01-05 17:54:00,470,It's +6 degrees on my deck and was pouring rain this morning.  The only problem is my whole driveway is sheer ice with water on top.  Pam
19349,walleyejigger,2007-01-05 18:11:00,876,"they had it on our lacal news last night how some brush and trees were budding and could result in damage to the trees as the ""new"" groth will most likely freeze,  and also how our moose and deer heards aren't having any trouble finding food so far, so that's good for them"
19509,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-06 01:16:00,957,"Fishbait, I'm going in May 12, a week before the walleye opener, and might go in earlier than the 12th.  I'll bet your outfitter would switch you to an earlier date, but that would mean meals of beans and pike instead of walleyes.  Arriving in camp before the usual opening might find you in camp before everything is fired up and ready, but that's OK.  The pike will be big and fat right after the ice breaks up."
