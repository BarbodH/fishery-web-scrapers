Any ways I am looking at trying Big Gull lake for May 24 weekend (guys trip for pike and walley) and then booking 2 weeks in late August for my wife and two young kids.We have been looking at Camps Bay resort it looks very nice I was just wondering if any one has fished the lake or stayed at this resort?Any info would be great I dont mind putting the leg work in to find the fish ,I really enjoy searching them out and trying different things but I dont want to waste my first real vacation with my family in over ten years on a fishless lake or  poor resort. My wife and kids love the outdoors and to fish almost as much as I do so its very important to me to find a good lake and clean resort.Thank You"
