19236,pikehunter,2007-01-05 12:32:00,1659,"The procedure was a breeze, the wait seemed long. I wasn't kocked out very deeply and was conscious of all that was going on. When I felt some pain, about halfway through i think, I told him to pump up the anesthetic. This morning the patch comes off and I'll know a bit better then how well it worked. My assumption so far is good. If it worked out perfect then I guese my next stop will be to get a clear lense for my glasses!  Thaks to everyone for your support."
19237,ccmtcanada,2007-01-05 12:35:00,7971,Great news!  Please update us when the patch comes off!  The next step after the clear lenses is a celebratory visit and shopping spree at Bass Pro Shops!!!
19239,lew,2007-01-05 12:43:00,12767,"That's good to hear Harry, and please keep us updated.  I think alot of times we put off important operations because of fear, and it is so often unfounded......I know I did."
19247,Smokey,2007-01-05 13:42:00,1278,"Good news. Theres no way they could do that to me while conscious, i'm way too much of a chicken. I hope it all goes well."
19270,Hooked,2007-01-05 14:29:00,891,Good stuff.
19271,Pigeontroller,2007-01-05 14:32:00,2793,"Gald to hear your doing good! I had a hernia fixed a few years back, general anesthetic, day surgery. I was still scared poop-less..."
19282,Roy,2007-01-05 15:04:00,13728,"Glad it went well Pikehunter.  ummm, Pigeontroller, and that improved your eyesight???"
19288,JorgeCarlos,2007-01-05 15:23:00,109,great news!!!
19296,Terry,2007-01-05 15:43:00,14456,"hope all is well got my first cataract at the age of 35....out in the sun too much had both eyes done..one is good the other didn't go too good...and now I have big trouble driving at night...all lights look like a blinking christmas tree  they can't put you out to do the op..as soon as you are out, or a sleep you start rapid eye movement, and that would make it hard for them to slice and dice your eye.....so you are awake for it...."
19298,Kirk,2007-01-05 15:53:00,347,Hope its 100% pikehunter
19304,Spiel,2007-01-05 16:03:00,9065,....Glad it went well Harry.
19433,pikehunter,2007-01-05 22:02:00,1659,"Thanks again everyone.  He took the patch off this morning. My operated eye is still a little blurry, not quite 20/20, but that is expected as my eye sight is so bad to start with. I can't wear my glasses either as it is worse than not wearing them. I took the operated eye lense out to see if that was going to work. That was worse, double vision. I'm afraid to drive just yet because my operated eye is OK, but the other eye is not, the Doc. said I would be alright to drive though as my vision is up to license standrds!  I have been scheduled in the O.R to get the right eye done to on Jan 18th. Maybe then I will have near perfect vision! Yippee!!! Finally maybe I can get normal sunglasses (polarized) for the first time in 43 years!"
19434,Bernie,2007-01-05 22:07:00,3190,"Man, I am so happy for you!   Good show"
19493,motv8tr,2007-01-06 00:27:00,2587,"Good to hear Pikehunter, and I'm glad you're not driving even if the Doc says it's ok...much better to wait an extra day or two and stay safe.  Maureen"
19674,ccmtcanada,2007-01-06 13:56:00,7971,Great news!! I'm sure the other eye will go just as well!!!
19687,pameladallaire,2007-01-06 14:38:00,470,That's great news.  My sister-in-law is an astronomer.  She had one eye done and the changes affected her vision in the telescope.  She refuses to get the second eye done because she uses that one to focus on the stars.  I'm glad everything went well.  Pam
