19350,barracuda,2007-01-05 18:13:00,41,"very interesting Tony. i've used hotshot 50s, kwikfish, and spinners with some success upriver but this hasta be the first time i've seen somethin as big as j-9s catching fish upriver in these parts. will hafta give it a shot sometime, must be pretty amusing.  "
19365,tonyb,2007-01-05 18:50:00,1637,"Nice BROWNIE!!!!!  It is hilarious, especially the orange bait in clear water, I could watch it disappear and then a big silver flash! Gets the blood rushing for sure.  The one brownie in the pics that has the silver j-9 in it's yap actually chased the lure out from the depths in one pool, I was blown away.  Good times, Tony"
