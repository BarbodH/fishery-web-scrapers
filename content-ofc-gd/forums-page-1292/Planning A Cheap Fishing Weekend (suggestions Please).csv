Any suggestions or outfitters would be greatly appreciated.  the species we are interested in are Northern Pike, walleye, perch  we have boats and are looking for somthing around $1000  for 4 people plus food and gas.  anyone info would be greatly appreciated.  thanks in advance."
19940,Smokey,2007-01-07 14:01:00,1278,You'll never find a flyin for those bucks but there are hundreds of resorts you can get a cottage at within the price range.  You can start your search here  Good Luck
19951,Garyv,2007-01-07 15:20:00,547," I agree with Smokey,  for a $1000 between 4 people for 2 to 3 days you are unlikely to find any fly in service that will meet your criteria."
19963,Handlebarz,2007-01-07 16:35:00,3790,  I'll also agree with Smokey try using our own OFC links we found a nice place just north of Tj's place that looks like some great fishing you will find alot of places in there just click away and read there web sites you will find what you need.
