I have a few questions that you may be able to help me with:  - where can I buy minnows?  I recall a place just off the 400 around major mackenzie - a bait shop near a Timmies I believe.  Is it still there and what time does it open or does anyone know the name of this place so I can call them?  If not, aywhere else along the way.  - where can I go on south Simcoe so we can get into steady action from shore and where I can be close to  the car in case my son needs to warm up a bit.  If you prefer to PM me that would be awesome as well.  Thanks and hopefully I may see some of you there."

19321,fishersquige,2007-01-05 16:53:00,52,"There is a bait shop off the 400 it is past the rutherford and major mackenzie exits. Its at the service station within king city right off the 400 N Fish Ontario Angling Inc. As for fishing one of the best shore spots on Simcoe right now is the Barrie docks.  The perch are in the thousands there you and your son will have non stop action. To get there take 400 North and get into Barrie exit at Essa road. Make a right on Essa (north), right on tiffin st. and a left on lakeshore dr. and you can't miss it.  Have fun.  Tight lines"
19323,fisher,2007-01-05 17:00:00,451,"Thanks - I imagine it is going to be very busy there tomorrow - as I have never fished there before  - do I need to show up early to get a spot or do you think that if I get there at 9:00 I will be fine??  BTW, I called the bait shop and they open at 5:00 am.  What bait/lures should I take other than minnows??"
19326,Fisherman,2007-01-05 17:05:00,7201,
19329,fishersquige,2007-01-05 17:09:00,52,"9 am is fine. There will be people on the docks just find a spot and fish no need to cast either.  Minnows, jigheads 1/16 1/32 tipped with tiny grubs or mini tubes are great, bring a couple pike lures for yourself they are in there as well."
19339,daisy_girl58,2007-01-05 17:47:00,116,"Hey Fisher try to bring back some pictures, will be cute to see the 3 yr old catch fish.... They get so excited, wished you could bottle the enthusiasm.... Good Luck!  Lorissa"
19505,drufis,2007-01-06 01:06:00,45,"I went for the first time myself the other day,   I took my 4yr old girl and she had a great time, everyone is therer is very friendly and nice.  You might even want to bring a bucket or chair for your kid to sit on.  I found it kept my girl in one spot and didn't have to worry to much about her getting excited and running around or leaning over to much.  Have great time let us know how it goes.  We caught about 30 or 40 perch, she actually caught the biggest one.   Have a good one."
19511,Rizzo,2007-01-06 01:20:00,4754,"ya, what they said.  Great place to keep the kids busy and catch a ton of 7 inch perch.  Rain tomorrow I think, but not too cold.  Don't stay longer than the young ones want and it should work out great"
19520,Greencoachdog,2007-01-06 01:45:00,8163,Don't forget to take a PFD for the young'un.
19641,Carp,2007-01-06 09:11:00,1488,Let us know how it turns out and a few pics would be nice. We likes da piks.  May get my 2 oldest out this weekend if plans and time permit.
