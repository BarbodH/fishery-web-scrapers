19330,gottabnuts,2007-01-05 17:09:00,2,"I`ll start with a belated seasons greetings to y`all .Hope that everyone had a safe and happy holiday season and also to say, WOW great look on the new board .It took me a bit to navigate but im sure that will come with use.  I`ve come to except that Im never gonna make it past the newbie level   . Every time I think I may advance ,the board changes.... DANG !!  .Site looks great none the less .  Anyway,Ive got a problem with the daily number of spam that I receive at home on Outlook express .On my work email (NOVELL)I have the option of excepting mail only from people on my contact list and all others get sent to a junk folder where I can simply deal with the whole batch at once ( Delete,Refuse mail from this domain  etc etc...)  It appears ( and I hope Im wrong ) that Outlook doesnt offer any spam relief with exception of the abilty to ""refuse mail from this sender ""option ,but I have to do this one email at a time!I`m recieving upwards of 300 a day !  ( could`nt find a smiley with tears that time ).  I really would rather not have to use another email system if I could avoid it as Im not the brightest ( easy ) when it comes to making changes .Last upgrade I made rendered the computer unuseable for a few weeks ( Mrs nuts was real pleased with me about that   .Middle and little nuts were`nt to happy either .  Anyway,I hope I gave enough or the proper information needed to help those of you who have the knowledge and / or the desire to aid me with .  Thanks  CHEERS  GBN"
19405,GbayGiant,2007-01-05 20:51:00,1780,"I'm in the same boat, get about 100 junk emails a day with outlook and can't find a way to stop it and it's always the same 5/10 companies sending the garbage, I email them back asking them to stop and they never do."
19418,steve_paul,2007-01-05 21:26:00,658,"Don't reply to them - do that and the number will multiply.  I had the same problem, phoned my internet provider and had a new email address issued.  They walked me through the changes I had to make, emailed my contact list with the new address and the 200 spams a day went away."
19424,Bernie,2007-01-05 21:34:00,3190,I use hotmail...Love it..Some like yahoo as well. ) 0 spam.
19440,bassman,2007-01-05 22:27:00,384,If you're a Rogers user you can use the web mail option instead of outlook. The Rogers Yahoo servers can filter out the SPAM for you once you set the parameters. I went from 100+ SPAM a day to maybe 1-2 a week.  Good luck.
19445,setomonkey,2007-01-05 22:37:00,872,"I don't use Outlook Express so I'm not sure how to help you. But once you hopefully get sorted out, do the following to avoid spam:  1. Never, never, did I say never?, reply to spam. All that does is confirm that your email address is valid, which means it will stay on spammer lists.  2. Create a freebie email account online (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, it doesn't matter) and use that to register for websites, enter online contests, etc. One way spammers get email addresses is to pick them up in public access areas, so you want to avoid using the one you have at work or at home.  3. Never post your home or work email address here or in other public forums. Use PMs or the email function via the board.  300+ spam a day, geez that would really bug me... hope you get it sorted out.  Mike"
19456,Guidofisherman,2007-01-05 23:05:00,206,"If you want to stick with Outlook Express, try a spam blocker program like Mailwasher. It can block unwanted junk mail at the server side before it gets to your computer. It is free and has the ability to allow ""friends"" and block others by using the  filter tab then selecting ""not me"". Here is a link to Snapfiles. http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/comm/fwspam.html Good luck."
19462,gottabnuts,2007-01-05 23:13:00,2,"You folks are da best hands down   .Thanks for your quick repies.I kinda thought that I may have to start up another account for email ,I guess I was just hoping to avoid that .It now boils down to waiting until a few of my freinds with some computer savey drop in for a spell.  I dont ever remember responding to spam ,or including the family email address to a site.The only email address that I have ever attached to a post was a hot mail address.Could spam somehow attach itself to the address when we visit websites ???  THanks all"
19471,Bly,2007-01-05 23:40:00,1556,"Ccmt and I used Outlook Express for awhile when we were receiving hundreds of spam and there are some preset filter options.........  Tools Message rules mail select ""where the from line caontains people"" select ""move to specified folder""   For this I created a folder named ""Our mail""  you should then see a blue link to add people and from there be able to choose everyone in your address book. Not a great long term solution but it helps in the meantime.    .  Hopes this helps in the short term....PM me if you need more info.   blyght"
19504,dsn,2007-01-06 00:59:00,1018," After you installed ""Spam fighter"".. you might want to run a spyware program and check for spyware that's stealing your email account right out from your computer. Its happened to me many times.   dsn"
19507,cantermore,2007-01-06 01:11:00,49,"I spent the $20.00 and the CA Anti Spam tool and I use that in conjunction with the Junk mail tools in Office 2003; since I added CA Anti Spam I havent had 1 junk mail in the inbox & I do get about 100 a day which I still read over the subject line & from email address as it will sometimes block someone that it shouldnt have... definetely a good buy  Regards, Johnny"
19654,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-06 13:25:00,0, I use Norton internet security with anti spam feature. Just like Johnny it sends all the crap in a spam folder. Very few make it into my inbox and like he mentions very few good e-mails make it in the spam folder. I get close to 200 a day and just look through the spam folder real fast before deleting them to make sure I don't loose some good ones.  I wish I could just change my e-mail address but since it's my business I guess I'll be stuck with it forever.
19677,setomonkey,2007-01-06 14:06:00,872,"One more thing, already mentioned by a few of the others, you should also get and make sure your anti-virus and anti-spyware software is up to date.  Avoiding viruses, spam, and other hassles means being careful about your computer security.  No need to spend a lot of money either, some free programs that I like are AVG (anti-virus), SpywareBlaster and Ad-Aware Personal (anti-spyware).  Mike"
