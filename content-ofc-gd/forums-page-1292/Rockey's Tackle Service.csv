The ABU had lost a lock clip on the level wind engagment pin.  I'm MORE than pleased with their FAST service and LOW pricing. Definitely not a get rich quick scheme going on there...just great low priced service and the volume that goes with happy customers! I won't hesitate to send anything their way in the future.  Penn 209 - $7 for a gear that they had to order in, as they don't carry Penn parts, and only $10 labour!  23 yr old ABU Mag II - $10.32 for a complete new line guide assembly and $25 to clean and lube it for the first time since purchased at LB's all them years ago. Just over a buck a year, and this has been my main reel for all those years except the last couple. Says something for ABU.  That's it..nothing else...just a happy customer with a story. Don't hesitate to send your reels in if they need some TLC.  Wayne"

Of course it was mine that that cost to fix the other was FREE.  vance"
