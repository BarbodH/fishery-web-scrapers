Is dock fishing doing any good right now, we have a private spot we go to.... Unless there is a better spot you might want to share.... Don't really want to risk the canoe, kind of gives me the heebie jeebies........... Appreciate your input.... Maybe we might see some of you out there....  Lorissa"
