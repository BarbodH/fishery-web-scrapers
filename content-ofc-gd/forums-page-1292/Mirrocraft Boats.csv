18881,Sherriff,2007-01-04 02:03:00,252,Anyone have any info on the quality of the Mirrocraft boats.  Specifically the 1845 Dual Impact XL.  Or if you have one are you happy with it?  Thanks  Sherriff
18894,irishfield,2007-01-04 02:48:00,26272,"Don't know the good the bad or the ugly Jeff, but if you are going new and get a price quoted I will see if Temagami Marine will beat it for you.  They still show a 1744 from last year with a 90 on it for $25K  http://www.temagamimarine.com/f1744.html  http://www.temagamimarine.com/mirrocraft.html"
18935,Carp,2007-01-04 05:05:00,1488,You buying a boat Jeff ?  SWEET !!!  I haven't really heard anything negative about them. (Mirrocraft) Seen quite a few of them on the lakes.
18975,Sherriff,2007-01-04 13:37:00,252,Still looking but it will happen soon Carp.....  See ya  Sherriff
18976,Roy,2007-01-04 13:44:00,13728,"Good luck with the purchase. You might want to consider a boat that doesn't have the word ""impact"" in its name though."
18980,1leggedangler,2007-01-04 14:08:00,364,"I've been riding in one for 8 years now, no complaints except for the disease all boat owners have of 2-footitice. Good luck with your search.  Cheers, 1leg"
18985,ssminnow,2007-01-04 14:46:00,48,I looked at them last fall. Never owned one but the one thing I liked on them was the aluminum floor.  Especially after replacing a the floor in mine a couple years ago.  Not a job I want to tackle again any time soon.
19709,John Bacon,2007-01-06 16:11:00,3277,I have never owned one.  But the owner of Bennett Marine told me that they were a good quality boat; and he didn't carry them.  It is not very often that a marina will admit that a brand that they don't carry is a good boat.
19727,fishindevil,2007-01-06 17:21:00,6254,"looks like a nice watersking boat but not a fishing boat,it doesnt look very practical for fishing,but hey i guess it would be a multipurpose boat if thats what you are lookin for....good luck cheers"
19745,Garyv,2007-01-06 17:50:00,547,"The 1845 impact is the fishing friendly version.  The xl gives you some extra bells and whistles and is more in touch with family boating, but could also function quite nicely for fishing.  My son purchased a basic Mirrocraft 14 foot big fisherman last spring and after being out in Huron with it, I was impressed with the way it handled big water."
