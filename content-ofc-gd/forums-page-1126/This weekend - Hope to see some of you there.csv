129437,dsn,2007-11-02 23:01:00,1018,"I'm only 15-20mins away from that CT.  . I've been there twice this week when they were giving out freebies.  And I wonder why they call it a ""GRAND OPENING"" when it's been there since I move into this location since june 1st. All they did was renovate the store. But they didn't shut the entire store down while they were doing it.  dsn"

And I work in the same office complex, Seriously I would come, I'm not that far.  Hope you hit the Woodbridge or Bowmanville store in the near future. Have a great day.  :clapping:"
129460,HTHM,2007-11-03 00:23:00,4082,So......does that mean you get a discount!!! HMMMM
129596,dsn,2007-11-03 20:44:00,1018,Well I showed up around 3:30pm  There was alot of coupon promotions going on with little catches like spend so much and get so little discount back kinda thingy.  I spun the wheel and got $6 bucks off today so I picked up some spoons. But I had to spend Minimum of $25 to get $6.00 off. My total was $15.00 but I guess the cashier didn't noticed the small print. So I got my $6.00 bucks.  Well the funny thing was my bro went before me and got a $1 off. The thing was he didn't even have a CT card in order to use the $1 off. ha ha ha  dsn
