129556,outdoorguy61,2007-11-03 14:39:00,220,"I was in Napanee the day before Halloween and did see a fresh run coming up the river. They were not a pretty site, with every salmon observed being black as a boot. Fishing pressure saw about 10 people, with most sadly underequipped to be taken seriously. Personally, I would switch to trout or walleye at this time.  The only caveat I would have is, it would be interesting to catch an Atlantic. I sure hope most people release them, as with multiple spawning runs as opposed to one for Pacific strains.... it all sounds like a nice thing for Ontario and parts of the US to me.  outdoorguy61"
129622,camillj,2007-11-03 22:35:00,1988,Cohos .... the odd small run will still come in (mostly lost souls from US stocking) .... but really the name of the game now is fall chrome !!!!!!!!
