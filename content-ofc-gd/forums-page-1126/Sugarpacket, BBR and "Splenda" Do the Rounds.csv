129691,Rich,2007-11-04 01:47:00,3927,"Sugarpacket, ""Splenda"" and I headed out locally today with hopes of just catching something in the mighty Lynn. I brought the noodle rod, cuz I figured even chubs put up a fight on it. lol  Sugarpacket scored with the first fish of the day, a scrappy white sucker, but before we could get a picture it scuttled back into the water.  I started carp fishing after seeing a carp nearby. And, then came the weirdness. I've heard of carp while trout fishing, but not trout while carp fishing. This little brown decided to hit a hook and corn still fished in the river.    After apparently singing it a serenade, I sent it back into the depths. Good to see some resident browns in the area!  Splenda tried his hand at fishing, but he was more interested in sleeping than fishing today.    After a few chubs and suckers we headed to a new spot and Splenda went to grandma & grandpa's house. The target here was steelhead, but us and the other anglers in the area just couldn't buy a bite. Bottom bouncing and float fishing just wouldn't produce. So yet again we moved spots and I showed Sugarpacket my favourite fall bass tactic. Jigging and dragging the bottom. It wasn't long before she was into one.    Minutes later, she was into another one, and this one would have been her PB. I got a good look and I'd say it was over 3lbs. But alas, right at the surface the hook popped out and back went Mr. Bass.  Then it was my turn. I got into a little bass and a bunch of WGSF, which excited me to no ends.      That was that for the day. It was a great day of fishing with the best company I could possibly have out there. Too bad Sugarpacket lost the big one but there will be many more days in the future for her to hook 'im.  Next comes deer season    lol jk I'm no hunter and that's no real gun."
