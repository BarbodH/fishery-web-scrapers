129004,Weeds,2007-11-01 22:06:00,782,"Hey, I'm taking my brother out for a shot at his first musky tomorrow morning, we'll probably fish for a few hours between 8 and 10. It occurs to me I've never caught a musky before 10, mostly cause I rarely fish all that early but do musky typically go on the feed early or late? Thanks,  P.S. I know 8 is not really all that early but you get what I mean."
129008,irishfield,2007-11-01 22:09:00,26272,We boated our first at 10:40 yesterday. Mind you we didn't hit the water until 10:15 !
129014,Zib,2007-11-01 22:14:00,369,"Back in September I was fishing a bass tourney on Lake St. Clair, my partner had 2 musky come up & take his fouled lure off the surface as he was retrieving it & I had one bite me off at the boat as well. This all happened between 7:00AM & 7:30AM. A week before that a another guy I know caught a 46"" musky that attacked his 10"" smallmouth & wouldn't let go so he netted it. That happened before the sun came up."
129018,Weeds,2007-11-01 22:17:00,782,Muy Bien!! (Very Good) Spanish 101 eh?
129025,lew,2007-11-01 22:34:00,12767,"Muskies will bite at any time of the day, and the transition from darkness to daylight is certainly a trigger for them, but I've always had my best success in the hour before sunset and the 2 hours that follow.  8-10 AM isn't really a transition from anything but is ceretainly a good time to try your luck.  Just remember, you'll never catch one from your living room, and if 8 - 10 is the only time you can get out on the water, then that is the best time to give it a shot.  Best of luck and don't ferget to let us know how you make out"
129026,Rich,2007-11-01 22:39:00,3927,"I've hooked them early, late and through the night. Get on 'em!"
129051,Weeds,2007-11-01 23:30:00,782,"Thanks gents, I'll bring my digital phone, takes crummy pics but the digital camera's finally crapped out. Let you know how we do."
129065,Rizzo,2007-11-01 23:55:00,4754,"I like the early morning bite, and at this time of year 8 a.m. is plenty early!"
129068,Roy,2007-11-02 00:05:00,13728,What Lew said.
129191,Squid,2007-11-02 12:17:00,1656,What Roy said...
129192,Crazyhook,2007-11-02 12:18:00,1154,caught one at 5:15 AM this summer if that means anything to you...
129196,tinbanger,2007-11-02 12:23:00,1028,Never mind Lew ...whats Wayne got to say
129199,lew,2007-11-02 12:31:00,12767,"I posted these 2 pics about a month ago, but both these fish came on the same day and within 15 minutes of each other, and both as the sun was just breaking over the horizon.  Again, a transition from one thing to another      And tinbanger, I think our boy, Musky Wayne, is gonna become someone to reckon with"
129200,tinbanger,2007-11-02 12:35:00,1028,"Nice pics Lew As you said anytime you can get out is good.  I've fishing turnoff and on like a light , mind you they weren't muskie .  As for Wayne ...I think its the new boat !  TB"
129220,irishfield,2007-11-02 13:22:00,26272, I'm goin with what Squid said..about Roy...about Lew !
129284,Weeds,2007-11-02 16:02:00,782,"Well, no musky to report. It was cold but beautiful this morning, thick clouds of fog and frost everywhere. Nice to get out with my bro too, Nothing caught but I think he enjoyed himself anyways and I did too."
129286,irishfield,2007-11-02 16:04:00,26272,At least you gave it a shot...more than all us internet junkies did this morning....
129290,lew,2007-11-02 16:08:00,12767,"Like I always say Weeds, you don't need to catch a fish, to have a great day of fish'n."
