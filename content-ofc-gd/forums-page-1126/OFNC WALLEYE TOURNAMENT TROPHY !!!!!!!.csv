129229,fishindevil,2007-11-02 13:56:00,6254,"Well here it is....... THE BAY OF QUINTE WALLEYE TOURNAMENT OFC TROPHY..!!!!!!!!!!  so everyone i have been working on this really nice trophy for our bay of quinte G2G on November 17,18 2007 i thought it would make it some great fun to fish for this awesome trophy,so we are going to do it by INCHES....the largest fish takes the trophy,we can do it the same way we run the board tourney.i will hand out forms to eveyone and when a fish is caught take a quick picture,measure the fish and release it,so seeing how i think everyone is fishing with a partner it shouldnt be a problem to get a pic,and for someone to help....its gonna be fun so the tournament will start saturday morning and go to sunday afternoon,so whoever wins the trophy will be able to keep it till next year when we do the same thing...so this will be our first annual OFC WALLEYE TOURNAMENT...if a fish is badly hooked and you have to keep it,or if you want to keep it you CANNOT ENTER THAT FISH !!!!!!!! so enjoy the pics of the trophy,and if i missed anything let me know,i think $10 dollars to enter the tourney is perfect....oh ya and the trophy is 3ft tall,.              "

129256,fishnsled,2007-11-02 15:05:00,3520,I'd like to see Headhunter get his name on that.  A great way for me to say thanks for helping me learn the Quinte fishery and for teaching me a few tricks.     I hope we can get'r done for ya HH.  Thanks Shawn for putting it together!
129257,BITEME,2007-11-02 15:07:00,1969,As long as [b]Big Bird [/b]dosent get it I'll be happy
129258,irishfield,2007-11-02 15:08:00,26272,Looks great Shawn ! Julie pose for the part on the top?
129260,Roy,2007-11-02 15:09:00,13728,Great job! Does it break down into sections? It won't fit in the Jeep.
129263,ccmtcanada,2007-11-02 15:10:00,7971, It's the same size as you and you fit in it....what's the issue?
129266,Roy,2007-11-02 15:11:00,13728,"It doesn't articulate as well as I do, Cliff. But thanks."
129283,SlowPoke,2007-11-02 16:02:00,2984,"I thought the last picture was the runner-up prize Good job putting this together Shawn, watch your back lifting this thing! -Brian"
129318,Headhunter,2007-11-02 17:16:00,5703,Nice Trophy! Wow and such kind words from FishnSled! I guess I'm wondering how the heck I would hook that thing onto my in-line planer board? Looks heavy enough to not even bother with the lead core!LOL Great job guys! HH
129331,Badger Shark,2007-11-02 18:07:00,291,"Now that is COOL!  , I know I have not been a member on here as long as most of you but I am working on getting someone to come down there for the weekend.  We probably will be staying in Belleville but it would be nice to meet you guys at some point.  We will launch at Picton harbour on the Saturday if I manage to get someone to join me, my buddy has to ask his wife it is ok  ,Im luck enough that my wife doesnt have a problem with me going fishing every weekend.  The closer we get to the date I will let you know if we are going to be there and maybe we can meet up.  Don"
129339,lew,2007-11-02 18:36:00,12767,"Shawn, that's really generous of you, adding a trophy, and then making a friendly tourney out of the trip. Something like that can really add some fun to an already fun event.  A group of us OFC friends had a  friendly little musky tourney last summer with a trophy thrown in for the winner, which just added to the fun of the whole thing.  And BTW, me being the winner was kinda nice too  "
129413,fishergirl72,2007-11-02 22:04:00,455,"Well after days of working on that beautiful trophy, you did an awesome job!   but honestly I cannot wait until that BIG trophy goes somewhere else since we don't have the room and I am tired of tripping over the dang thing!LOL   But now watch by my luck, Shawn will win his own trophy and it will come back here.LOL  Seriously though, You did a great job and it was VERY kind of you to make that for a fun tournament and the promotion of Catch and Release is a great and smart idea! You should take pride in the work that you have done!   I just wish I could go to BOQ this year, but work calls so I hope maybe that next year I can be able to go. I have not ever been there yet and I would love to go there someday   I wish you luck Shawn on the tournament and I know that you will have a GREAT weekend of fishing and fun!   You deserve it after you work so hard for this family and of the two surgeries that you had in the last couple of months!   GO SHAWN GO!!!!"
129419,Dano,2007-11-02 22:23:00,719,"Ha ha, right on. That is a great idea, and to see it to fruition, very admirable. Nice job."
129481,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-03 01:10:00,1183,VERY NICE!!!
129485,Mike the Pike,2007-11-03 01:16:00,3421, Oh I enjoyed taking your money last year Peter out of seven of us I was the one with the heaviest Walleye on Saturday of last Year.  Can't say how I will do but I am sure as hell going to try.  Hey Shawn is your boat the runner up prize  Nice job with the trophy Shawn
