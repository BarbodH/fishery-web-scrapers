You seem like a great group and I look forward to meeting some of you on the water.  Love my steel and smallie fishing with some carp and pike thrown in.  Fish all L.O. tribs between cobourg and mississauga when I'm home and get up to the bighead and beaver on weekends as well as the wiarton area for smallies.  Anyway, hopefully I can learn as well as contribute something from time to time.  See you on the water.  Chris."

Since you've been lurking for a bit then you'll know that this is somewhat like a family...we fight, make up, and even get around to posting a few reports! LOL.  I'll be trying out a trib or two this weekend looking for steel...maybe I'll see you out there one day."
