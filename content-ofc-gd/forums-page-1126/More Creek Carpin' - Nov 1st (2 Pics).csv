129022,Rich,2007-11-01 22:25:00,3927,"The water has cooled, and the carp behavior reflected that today as I hit the mighty Lynn. 2/2 was the score today using canned corn. If I tried anything else, the chub minnows were all over it. The cold water pushed carp to the slowest backwaters and in behind logjams. I had to sneak up really low and walk through some brush to get close to any. Lots of fun when I finally did hook one in those conditions. Creek carpin' is fun, and similar to steelheading, but it's not quite cutting it for me. I think I need to make a trip for steel soon!    "

129333,ccmtcanada,2007-11-02 18:15:00,7971,Nice going Rich!  I kinda miss them too...but the waiting game for me it hard in this colder weather...I need to be up and moving or I cant last out there long.  nice fish!
129371,Rich,2007-11-02 19:35:00,3927,"No waiting involved buddy! I stalk them in the creek just like stalking salmon or steel. When I spot a fish, I throw a handful of corn upstream to get them feeding, then toss my corn just a little closer than the chum. It's awesome to sight fish carp, way better than still fishing IMO"
