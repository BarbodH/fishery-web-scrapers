129009,irishfield,2007-11-01 22:10:00,26272,Bewildering...hopefully it was a REALLY healthy newborn to survive this ordeal.
129017,walleyejigger,2007-11-01 22:16:00,876,"very scary indeed, got searched on my way home, hope they find the baby soon and in good health"
129041,Deano,2007-11-01 23:01:00,767,"Ch 230 of Bell Expressvu also has a picture posted of the abductor. If anyone can help, please do."
129045,Muskieman,2007-11-01 23:09:00,2472,same as Walleyejigger took me a little while longer to get home from Sudbury..OPP & Greater Sudbury Police are thoroughly checkin' vehicles...  people like her aren't right in the head.... hope they find the little girl soon..  prayers go out to the family.
129064,Rizzo,2007-11-01 23:53:00,4754,"wow very sad and scary.  After having 2 children the past couple of years, I can't understand how this could happen.  The babies NEVER left my wife's side, but more importantly, I had to practically give DNA just to get in to see mom/baby.  Strangers could not just walk in to the maternity ward."
129086,Deano,2007-11-02 00:23:00,767,"Apparently she was wearing clothes similar to staff, she told the mother she had to take the baby to get weighed,and I guess they figured she was a nurse. This is just hearsay though. They got a good pic and video so hopefully this will have a good outcome."
129111,Deano,2007-11-02 01:02:00,767,Hearing word she has been found in Kirkland Lake. I'm hoping so.
129114,fatherof3,2007-11-02 01:08:00,1769,hope this ends well
129115,Deano,2007-11-02 01:09:00,767,"Confirmed, baby is well, news report just came on."
129117,fatherof3,2007-11-02 01:14:00,1769,good to hear
129122,Rizzo,2007-11-02 01:25:00,4754,great news.  The woman who took the baby walks away with probation probably or a brief stint in a psychiatric facility.  What a world we live in.
129140,KyleM,2007-11-02 02:34:00,218,Chop her hands off.
