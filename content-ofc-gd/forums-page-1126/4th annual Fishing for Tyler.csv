128768,ccmtcanada,2007-11-01 11:43:00,7971,Cant wait!  Hold on a second...did I just say I cant wait for ice fishing?? Oh man...what's the world coming to?  My little one asked me just last week when we can walk on the lake and fish in a hole again....haha.  Will be there again for sure!
128804,tonyb,2007-11-01 13:06:00,1637,"Oh... for a second there I though it was going to be on the newly created holiday in February - Family Day (Feb 18th).  They should co-incide that holiday with the License-Free fishing weekend which is the following weekend...  The Feb 23rd weekend is the license-free weekend, so there is no excuse for everyone to not drag anyone they know out onto the ice to support the cause  I think this year I WON'T try walking across to the other side of the lake  Tony"
