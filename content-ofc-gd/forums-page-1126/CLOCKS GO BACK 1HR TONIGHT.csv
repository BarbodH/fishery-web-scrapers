129607,lew,2007-11-03 21:35:00,12767,And don't forget to change the batteries in ALL your smoke detectors too.  Changing them with your clocks twice a year is a good way to remember.   You DO have smoke detectors.......don't you ??

129703,pikehunter,2007-11-04 02:16:00,1659," That is exactly why you need at least one battery operated smoke detector. Get one, even a cheap one for less than 10 bucks."
129708,irishfield,2007-11-04 02:23:00,26272,A high percentage of fires happen when the power is out...candles for light etc. and what Pikehunter said..buy one. $15 or your life?
