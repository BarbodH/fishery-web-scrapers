129130,Tybo,2007-11-02 01:56:00,1373,I just received the Mark's flyer. It has outwear with T-max stuff. Has anyone used this type of insulation. Is it any good.  I'm a outdoor worker. The warmer the better.
129132,danc,2007-11-02 02:07:00,4677,"I wear insulated Carhartt clothing during the winter. In fact I may be wearing it tomorrow for the first time this season. I buy all of it on E Bay for about a third of the price that it costs up here. It gets cold up here Tybo. If it works up here, it should work down in the balmy south."
129133,Roy,2007-11-02 02:07:00,13728,"I think that as far as natural products are concerned, Joey would be the warmest thing on the planet."
129135,wallyboss,2007-11-02 02:14:00,1095,"DanC Carhartt are definetly warm, but Richmond Hill is not as a cold as Thunder Bay in the Winter so there is a lot of slush out there .  And the denim like material of carhart stays wet too long.  I am from Northern Ontario myself and I worked outside in Ottawa for 22 years since I left Up north. and we have to wear different clothes down here.  Tybo I haven't tried T-Max but it seems to be similar to Goretex for the cold ."
129137,Tybo,2007-11-02 02:19:00,1373,"Dan, I already wear Carhartt  What I'm looking for is a large Hydro parka for when it's raining or wet snow."
129142,danc,2007-11-02 02:40:00,4677,"Whatever you're looking for Tybo, look on E bay first. I buy all of my work clothes there now. I've bought the same things that are 1/5th of the price on E Bay that they are at Marks. Happy shopping and stay warm out there Bud..."
129147,Fisherman,2007-11-02 02:55:00,7201,"Besides, Marks Work Wearhouse...isn't anymore, it's turned into another womens store, used to be nothing but WORK wear, just about everything but now."
129185,bushart,2007-11-02 11:29:00,2628,"If your looking to stay warm on the coldest of days check out the Arcticshield products. It is more than hunting clothing as I've worn it ice fishing in Northern Ontario and been more than comfortable.  They use something called ""Retain"" to reflect back your body heat--waterproof as well--nice stuff.  If you can't find a dealer in your area -- www.arcticshield.ca  Hope this helps"
129186,fishman1023,2007-11-02 11:34:00,6,"Carhartt just came out with a waterproof, breathable and wind proof outer wear.  It is not heavy lined but is made to be able to layer clothing underneath it.  Have not tried my suit yet but bought it mainly for ice fishing out of doors."
