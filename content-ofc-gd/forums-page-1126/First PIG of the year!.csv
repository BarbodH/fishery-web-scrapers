I figure he weighed around 10 pounds he was really fat but the pic don't show it that well.  That is the tree I hooked him under in the top left and man what a bleep! it was to get him to come out from under there he musta went under there 6 or 7 times and each time I miraculously pulled him out.  Definately a fight to remember  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...wk11/10lber.jpg  http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd148/c...0lbercloser.jpg  Hawk"
