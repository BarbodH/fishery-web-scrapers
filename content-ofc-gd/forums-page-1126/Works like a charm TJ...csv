128961,irishfield,2007-11-01 20:35:00,26272,Peanut butter tilt a whirl...works like a charm!
128962,irishfield,2007-11-01 20:36:00,26272,..
128966,douG,2007-11-01 20:42:00,2693,"Wayne, are there any holes in the bottle, or is it just pb inside the bottle?  I like the idea too as the trap doesn't need resetting.  Certainly annoying to see your bait cleaned off your standard style trap.  Tis the season!"
128967,irishfield,2007-11-01 20:46:00,26272,"Just stuck a tig wire thru the bottom and the lid on the injection gate marks...trimmed a little notch in each side of the bucket for a pivot point and smeared peanut butter on two sides of the bottle. Looks like they got a little feast...before they went for a ride...as some butter is missin,"
128972,kickingfrog,2007-11-01 21:00:00,8333,"That is almost certainly a better mouse trap, but there is something to be said for laying in your bed at night in the cabin and counting the snaps as you drift off."
128983,Terry,2007-11-01 21:38:00,14456,"so I take it the walk up the 1by2 hop on the bottle to get the p butter , it rolls they fall in and can't jump back out...cool might try that..but I like my rodents dead when I dispose of them"
128989,irishfield,2007-11-01 21:41:00,26272,Oh..they're dead Terry! I tink they get tired of swimmin after a while. This way you don't have to touch a disease ridden trap/mouse trying to get their neck free either!
128993,thecraftyprince,2007-11-01 21:47:00,37,
128998,irishfield,2007-11-01 21:55:00,26272,Yah..purists would kill me Graham! But covers = condensation..no matter how well they breath. And that's a 'bird..not a 'bee.
129000,misfish,2007-11-01 22:00:00,29133,"You have a super B ??????????? WANT TO SELL.LOL Quick Terry.make an offer.HAHAHAHAHA Mice on a stick,I think theres a market for that.Coated with PB is a bonus,"
129002,douG,2007-11-01 22:05:00,2693,"PB is on the outside of the bottle, ,right?  I'm going to whip up one of those puppies tonight for the loft in the garage.  I bet a little antifreeze with the water in the bucket will make this a 4 season device."
129003,irishfield,2007-11-01 22:06:00,26272, Yep...the get a treat if they're quick !
129005,Roy,2007-11-01 22:06:00,13728,It's not just the water that does them in. They die from exertion trying to get the peanut butter from sticking to the roof of their little mouths.  I'm going to try that trap this year. Last year I got 17 meeces with the regular traps. That's 5 more than I needed for a coat.
129006,irishfield,2007-11-01 22:07:00,26272,
129010,douG,2007-11-01 22:11:00,2693,"All right already.  Funny right there, Roy.  Happy now?  Jeeze."
129013,walleyejigger,2007-11-01 22:13:00,876,"will have to make one for the deer camp next week, we usually have our ""own"" trap and have a little competition at camp, see who can catch the most, we always talk about makin one with a bucket but this year is the year"
129016,Terry,2007-11-01 22:16:00,14456,"works for me, I am going to give it a try"
129030,thecraftyprince,2007-11-01 22:44:00,37,"  Oops !!  Always get the 'birds and 'bees mixed up. I saw a crazy plum go for 90 large at auction  , yes us funds. Well it meant something then !"
129043,misfish,2007-11-01 23:08:00,29133,Plum crazy sweet. Had a wild green Grelin (Gator chomp) back in the day in Brampton. Could burn the rubber of them back wheels like nothing.
129060,Tybo,2007-11-01 23:47:00,1373,"HAA,Ha Roy.  Worlds oldest mouse trap, and you guys are just catching up."
129066,Dano,2007-11-01 23:59:00,719,   I second that!!
