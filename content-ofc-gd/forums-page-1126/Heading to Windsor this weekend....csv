125821,mooseroo,2007-10-23 00:06:00,80,I'm heading down to visit my parents in Windsor and was thinking of taking my rod and some tackle in case I can get out along the Detroit River some evening. Anyone got ideas on what I might be lurking along the riverfront? I'll be casting from shore.

125900,brandon,2007-10-23 04:06:00,857,you just might hook into some fish like in your avatar.....  but just toss on a pickeral rig with worms or minnows and u'll get yourself into anything out there
125961,Zib,2007-10-23 13:20:00,369,"If you are casting at night you just might hook into some of these:      None of those walleye had 3 eyes but I did catch one back in April in the DR that only had one eye.  You will need jig heads that are no less than 1/2 oz. The current in the Detroit River gets up to 7 Mph so the current will take your bait down stream pretty fast. Cast along the break walls at night with jerkbaits if you see or hear fish busting the surface. If fishing during the day you will want to fish a jig with a 4"" straight tailed worm (pumpkinseed or black works best) or a Fin-S minnow (rainbow trout or smelt color work best).  There is also plenty of channel cats, smallies, & sheephead. There are also some big musky (50+"") in there as well. Also some sturgeon but those show up more in the spring."

126234,brandon,2007-10-24 04:39:00,857,Riverside is good except you may get kicked out.......most of the marinas don't allow fishing but fish till you get booted cuz some of the best fishing is in them
126251,FinS,2007-10-24 11:40:00,463,  November 1st is open to the fisherman at riverside city marina
126417,mooseroo,2007-10-24 20:15:00,80,"Thanks for the tips! If I get out I'll let you all know how it goes.  I'll be just a few minutes from Lauzon and Riverside, so I'll try to hit up the marina. Google Earth here I come!  Edit: Quick question... is there anything in where A-bars was. It's closed down from what I remember and it had some boat slips. Can you get out there?  <iframe width=""425"" height=""350"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" src=""http://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=42.340854,-82.948574&spn=0.002665,0.005021&z=18&om=1&output=embed&s=AARTsJpnOA3ioEtcI9rx_v7gyZqlolGTYw""></iframe><br /><small><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=42.340854,-82.948574&spn=0.002665,0.005021&z=18&om=1&source=embed"" style=""color:#0000FF;text-align:left"">View Larger Map</a></small>"
126592,brandon,2007-10-25 02:26:00,857,Abars is still open and theres parking behind it.  I've seen some bass under the docks there but it's quite shallow.  However you can also cast out into the main river too from there so it's worth a shot
129483,mooseroo,2007-11-03 01:14:00,80,I didn't get out for any fishing but I did get over to Cabelas. Didn't buy much but I did walk around with my jaw open. So much stuff! Will have to go back! Super store!
