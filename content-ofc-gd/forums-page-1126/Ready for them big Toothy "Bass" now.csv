Got the Monster tubes I bought from RedOctober ready to go. They come with a weighted single hook..not sure what LARGE # it is..and I wanted to add trailer hooks. What did I have around here I thought....ah...032 stainless safety tie wire..some twistin pliers and I went to town. Ready for the Bay in the mornin. BTW..to give an idea of size...those are 6/0 trailer trebles and those pliers are 10"" or so long!        "
129443,fishindevil,2007-11-02 23:13:00,6254,"RIGHT ON CAPT.WAYNE !!!!!!! oohhhhhh those look great.  ..im sure there is a big girl in the bay right now just waiting to see them.....great idea,with adding the weight,they look like drop-shot weights!!!! good luck tommorow and give us a great report and some pics of a nice 50""er.....cheers"
129444,mikeh,2007-11-02 23:20:00,824,"what size sinker did you use, surprised you didn't rig one up with 2 sinkers for deeper water when you know the fish is under the boat. they do look pretty good."
129445,irishfield,2007-11-02 23:23:00,26272,The sinker and hook are the way they came from RedOctober. I believe it's an ounce...but the hook weights just as much. Plenty for a none current enviroment.
129459,Crazyhook,2007-11-03 00:15:00,1154,"they are some sweet baits, and they do catch fish too!"
129524,motv8tr,2007-11-03 07:34:00,2587,Just don't forget to have your back up rod ready to go
129528,misfish,2007-11-03 11:25:00,29133,"Funny looking ounce,,,,,,,,,,,,,never mind. They look rteal nice Wayne.Good luck out there today.  My buyer is on his way up as I type."
129652,OhioFisherman,2007-11-04 00:36:00,6623,Wayne could you accomplish the same deal with a ball bearing swivel snap on a treble hook and a piece of surgical tubing to hold it onto the main hook? Like a trailer hook on a spinner bait?
129656,irishfield,2007-11-04 00:47:00,26272,Sure you could Paul. Many ways it could be done.
129662,OhioFisherman,2007-11-04 01:06:00,6623,"Just wondered Wayne, never used a tube that big, and never put a trailer hook on a bass sized tube. I have used the surgical tubing to add a rattle quickly and have hung a spinner off the hook to give more of a flash. Just like to be able to remove them easily."
129670,irishfield,2007-11-04 01:15:00,26272,Easy way Paul would be a snap swivel and a split ring. Use the swivel ring/split ring to put the treble on and use the snap over the single hook. A small disk of plastic with a hole popped over the hook barb..or like you say surgical tube if it' big enough to retain the snaps width.
