129158,Hooked,2007-11-02 04:12:00,891,"Was wondering, if a bait casting reel is rated for a minimum of 12lb line, are there any issues spooling a diameter like a 6lb or 8lb diameter on it?  I would spool some kind of braid on it.  I've pretty much been a spinning reel kinda guy, just wondering."
129160,OhioFisherman,2007-11-02 04:33:00,6623,"Hooked it depends on the reel, my older Abus wouldn`t work well with less than 12 pound test, some times on a cast the line would get between the spool and the housing with 10 pound test, my preference for the open waters of lake erie. Never had any problem using 10 on my shimanos, a different spool shape closer tolerances.  You can probably tell by looking at the spool and housing, if you have it adjusted for a normal use see the size of the gap if one is visable. Maybe try and see if the line test you want to use will slip into it.  I haven`t really looked at any reels lately to see spool shapes and designs, it was the only problem I had and I never used less than 10 # on a baitcaster, no particular reason to."

129387,silveradosheriff,2007-11-02 20:41:00,1025,If you're going to use braid - don't forget your backing. I like to match the diameter of the mono backing with the diameter of the braid - but that is personal preference.  :-)
