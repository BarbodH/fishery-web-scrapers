I have no idea if this (the French) is the same kind of bloom, but the lake had great fishing this Spring, and there was no noticeable kill like what Scugog saw."

Ranger Bay is horrendous for that, MNR has known about it for years.  Some of them are still using 45 gallon drums buried in the ground with holes drilled in them.  With that much organic waste it doesn't take long for algae to go insane.  The MOE passed some laws back in 2003 (or 2004), that strictly dictates no more septic systems, only tile beds and even that has to be inspected."

129523,Musky Chaser,2007-11-03 05:35:00,2,Thats really to bad to hear. Living in Sudbury and fishing in those waters i will do some research myself and contact Mr Ault for more infoand see if there could be a solution or not.
