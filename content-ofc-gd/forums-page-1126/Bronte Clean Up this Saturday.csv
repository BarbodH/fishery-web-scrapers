128509,douG,2007-10-31 17:55:00,2693,Please take a look at the sticky posted by TonyB.  It would be great to see some GTA OFNrs there.  Hope you can make it!
128521,tonyb,2007-10-31 18:35:00,1637,"Thanks Doug...working with the City of Oakville right now...they have recently closed the gate at the top of the hill so I am trying to get it opened for Saturday.  Otherwise, keep an eye out for a location change.  Sorry about the last minute change, but with the warm weather we have been having I didn't think they would be closing the park so soon...  Stay tuned! and I'll update the sticky if there are any changes.  I'm hoping they can accomodate the gate issue... Tony"
