129370,cantermore,2007-11-02 19:35:00,49,I know this almost sounds silly; but might anyone know the exact voltage that should be in a fully charged 12 volt boat battery? one would think by the name its 12 v of course but for some reason I thought it was more..  Thanks
129373,irishfield,2007-11-02 19:36:00,26272,If it's been charged and sitting for a few days...usually about 13.2 to 13.7 Volts If it's less than 12..she's toast
129374,cantermore,2007-11-02 19:40:00,49,"Thanks, I have an older manual charger on it & pulled it off at 12 & its holding around there, I have a meter on it but will let it run a bit more to get it up there."
129377,irishfield,2007-11-02 19:47:00,26272,If it's holding at 12 it should charge some more. You have 6 cells...each produce about 2.2 volts when charged..so if you have a bad cell you'll only get about 11.4 volts or so...
129378,huey graphite,2007-11-02 19:49:00,362,"Make sure when you test the battery voltage you have a load applied such as running the trolling motor or a bilge pump (something with sufficient amp draw.... lights aren't enough). This will give you a true indication of the status of your battery. With no load your only getting a ""surface"" voltage and even bad batteries can sometimes read 12V.  Typically a fully charged battery should be around 13.0V under load. A discharged battery will measure 12.0V or under. Batteries significantly under 12.0V will sulfate and have very little run time."
129379,irishfield,2007-11-02 19:51:00,26272,..and what Huey said! Had a customers battery that wouldn't start his airplane last week. It had 12.8 volts...and absolutely not a drop of acid left in it from him overcharging it all summer at his cottage.
129384,cantermore,2007-11-02 20:36:00,49,"going out to put the charger on it now but will find something to load it down first, I know I have a 12 V compressor that should do it. If not the downriggers are here too  Thanks again"
