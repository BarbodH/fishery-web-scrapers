She's the exact opposite of an outdoorsy type but she absolutely loved it.  The accomodations, food, service and fishing are so good that she didn't even recognize we were hours away from the nearest human settlement.  On our first day, she caught a 29lb laker after we had been on the water 5 minutes. We proceeded to average about 50-60 fish per day for a week. Our guide was great, the scenery is beautiful and the weather is perfect.  She (and I) had a blast!  Here she is with her first big fish. "
