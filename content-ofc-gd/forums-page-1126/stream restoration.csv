Looking to do basic clean ups , bank stabilization , silt control , landowner education etc. much of the creek runs thru city property ( private land farther south)  My question is has anyone had any experince with oprganizing a stream restoration program? have looked at Trout unlimited web site but nothing obvious.  The company I work has a program that provides sponsorship and volunteer labour as well.  With the vast experiences out there thought I'd ask  TB"
