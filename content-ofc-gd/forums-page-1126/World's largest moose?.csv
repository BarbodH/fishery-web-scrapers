129584,Muskieman,2007-11-03 18:51:00,2472,apparently this Moose was shot in Russia and weighed in at 2500lbs and measured 15 feet at the head?  that's 1000 lbs bigger than a big Canadian Bull Moose..
129586,bigfish1965,2007-11-03 19:13:00,3382,"They used angles to make the moose look bigger, but he's still a monster. Not quite as big as PF the FF, but big all the same."
