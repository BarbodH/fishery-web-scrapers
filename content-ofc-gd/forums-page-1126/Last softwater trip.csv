129317,keram,2007-11-02 17:13:00,585,"Yup. tomorrow is the Day. I have still about 10 liters of gas in the tank, so this is a perfect reason to burn it. I will be on Scugog (first time this year)on the east side of an island (island marina ). never had any luck there, so I do not expect any different  , but like Lew says "" you cannot catch afish in the bedroom"".  . It should be nice day on the water ( this is what I like )"
129352,fishnsled,2007-11-02 18:58:00,3520,"Good luck tomorrow, it might just be your day!  Work the channel and it's edges, you should pic up something."
129354,ccmtcanada,2007-11-02 19:00:00,7971,There's a channel in Scugog?  No way!! LOL.  Good luck out there!!
129355,keram,2007-11-02 19:00:00,585," Now, this is THE advice I've was looking for"
129375,irishfield,2007-11-02 19:43:00,26272, Three of them in total ! ..and I'd call them holes more than channels!  ...and if Will meant the boat channel...well that works toooooooo  Just be aware that most of the markers are gone...just a few Red ones left out at key points.
129392,fishindevil,2007-11-02 20:57:00,6254,"Good luck keram !!!!! head right across from island marina,and fish right by the rock point,its called ball point....its about 5-7ft deep then gradually drops to almost 10ft towards the cesarea side.  ...try trolling a worm harness & dew worm,or drifting a drop shot rig....there is still a few spots of green cabbage out there so go get them....cheers"
129393,irishfield,2007-11-02 21:00:00,26272, A FEW spots? We had to use a good part of my 275 HP to get thru a few spots IN THE CHANNEL..the weeds are so thick. They are all still green and flourishing.  I figured he was after Muskie..not Bait!  LOL
