So far this week... new speed sensor for the transom... 2 x 1500 yd spools of 30lb power pro in anticipation of 4 down rigging reels I'm still searching for... thanks to Lb's cancelling my order.  Use the time to plan an ice fishing trip, or two, with some lads you've come to enjoy fishing with in the summer. I've been converted..never ice fished 'till the last couple years and now can't wait to get out and do this with the lads. We've already got our 4 day weekend picked out and planning the travel arrangements, meals, etc.     "

143483,irishfield,2007-12-17 18:33:00,26272," You're just doing it all wrong. I've never had a child keep me off the water or shore. Make a family day out of it... picnic by the stream/river/lake. A bit of romance, some time with your child...and when baby starts crying stick him on a boob and hit the shoreline!"
