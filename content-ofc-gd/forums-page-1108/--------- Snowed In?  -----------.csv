143165,Clampet,2007-12-16 18:54:00,1947,First One.    The second Dish 
143169,Beans,2007-12-16 19:02:00,3339,Ground possum stew and sufferin' succastash...  what did I win ?
143171,walleyejigger,2007-12-16 19:05:00,876,"first one looks like ""bottom of the crisper surprise"" and the second pork n beans ??"
143174,Roy,2007-12-16 19:11:00,13728,The stove is an Admiral and you shouldn't leave a spoon on the stovetop.
143176,Fisherman,2007-12-16 19:13:00,7201,Why?
143181,Tybo,2007-12-16 19:20:00,1373,You can create a short between the electric element and the spoon.  Top one looks like jumbolilla.(spelling)
143183,Clampet,2007-12-16 19:27:00,1947, Don't worry it's a ...GATES!
143187,keram,2007-12-16 19:34:00,585,"First one looking good Second, I do not know   , but it is going to be explosive"
143200,Bear,2007-12-16 20:53:00,106,1- spaggetti sauce 2- baked beans  Dont really matter both look good
143204,douG,2007-12-16 21:32:00,2693,"So, splain me again?  The spoon creates a short between the element and what?  Generally pretty dang easy to keep the utensils off the elements,  I find.  Tupperware is more of a problem imo.  I would guess pasta sauce Bolgnese and beans.  Hmmm, beans.  What time should we show up?"
143205,pigeonfisher,2007-12-16 21:35:00,696,"I got two pots of chili on.  One hot for the missus and I and a ""chili light"" for the wee ones."
143268,motv8tr,2007-12-17 00:42:00,2587,"Top one I'd say is spagetti sauce with mushrooms and maybe a jalapeno or two?  the second one, well I wouldn't eat it if you'd pay me, in fact you'd be best to pay me not to eat it   has some pork and ugh beans in it  Maureen"
143271,Clampet,2007-12-17 00:44:00,1947," Actually, I made good use of a Strip-Loin Steak I had defrosted the day b4."
143272,holdfast,2007-12-17 00:46:00,1813,Nothing because its Grits and Black eyed Peas
143276,Greencoachdog,2007-12-17 00:59:00,8163," That's the funniest lookin' Grits an' Black-eyed peas I've ever seen!!!  The first one is definitely Fricassee of Possum innards, and the second one looks to be Hummin' Bird eggs and Mountain Oysters!!!  Hope there's enough for seconds!"
