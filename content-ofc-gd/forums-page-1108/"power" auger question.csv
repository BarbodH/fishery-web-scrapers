143491,kickingfrog,2007-12-17 18:56:00,8333,"""Other than drilling 1 1/8"" holes for salom poles... no !""  Not sure if that was meant to make me laugh or not but it did. To clarify, if no joke was intended, I have seen a few fishin' shows use a cordless drill attached to a ice auger (6 inch, but as my wife insists, I'm not a good judge of size). I'm not willing to haul a gas auger out but thought this might be an option. I would have thought that keeping the battery warm would be an issue, not to mention the power needed for multiple holes on think ice."

143515,largemouth,2007-12-17 20:28:00,112,"I have a 18volt cordless drill and an adaptor for my 6"" auger and last season I got approx. 6-8 holes per battery (ice thickness 8""-10""). I bring two batteries and it is a lot lighter and quiter than a gas powered auger, but once the ice gets over 12"" i'd prefer a gas auger. The colder the weather the shorter the batteries will last, but definately worth the $20 and now my elbow and arm only hurt from landing the monsters, not drilling"
