143011,young_one,2007-12-16 07:37:00,620,"Planning to buy an power ice auger this month. I primarily fish for perch/walleye. Something light-weighted would be nice. I've only been looking through Lebaron catalogue, and Basspro flier.  These are my options, but Iâ€™m opened for suggestions:  (I don't need the best)  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_fall_07/icefishi...iffy_eskimo.pdf http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...mp;pageNumber=2"
143019,FinS,2007-12-16 12:35:00,463,the strikemaster from basspro is a good deal 299.99

143114,Rizzo,2007-12-16 16:24:00,4754,I've had an Eskimo for around 5 years and it has been good to me for the most part.  Only issue I've had was in extreme cold (-30 temps we had a few winters ago) I could not get it to start.  Guys with Jiffy's around me were able to fire their's up.  When the sun came up and things improved a few degrees I was able to get it going (luckily the Jiffy boys had already drilled a few holes for me)
143115,Fang,2007-12-16 16:32:00,1330,"Jiffy's worth every penny  Don't see too many operators up north using anything else.  That being said my buddy bought the 8"" Strikemaster at BPS - Gonna give that one a work out this year  We always have the 6"" normark manual as back up"
143130,addict,2007-12-16 17:06:00,475,manual ones always start
143191,Sinker,2007-12-16 19:46:00,8692," Only time my jiffy hasn't started was when it was out of gas. I haven't even changed the plugs or anything in it. Put gas in, prime it, pull it, drill holes......its really that easy. I've got a newer 2hp with the 9"" blade as well, and it runs great, but seems to take a couple minutes to warm up. The model 30 with the 10"" bit is kick ass.  Sinker"
143193,PERCHER,2007-12-16 19:50:00,787,"Wallmart has the Jiffy 30 9"" for $419.00.Thats not a bad price for one of those."
143194,Guest skeeter99,2007-12-16 19:57:00,0,just to let you know  if you know anyone with a costco membership they have a eskimo 3 hp 8 inch power auger for $249.00  not a bad deal  they are down the aisle against the wall were the automotive stiff is same wall they keep fridges freezers etc.. on
143195,raysfish2005,2007-12-16 19:57:00,163,"I have the 2hrs strikemaster 8"", love the auger 63 holes per tank!!!, it goes threw ice like a champ!!"
143213,young_one,2007-12-16 22:08:00,620,"thanks for everyone's input. Skeeter, which Costco are you talking about? When was the last time you seen it? 3hp under 300 sounds like a gd deal."
143214,Guest skeeter99,2007-12-16 22:10:00,0,"at the costco in ajax  but pretty much all of them have em, it is just how many make some calls to the stores nearest you  oh forgot it was about a week and a half ago"
