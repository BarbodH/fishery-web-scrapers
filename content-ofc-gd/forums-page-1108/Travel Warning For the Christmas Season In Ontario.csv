I just wanted to give you a warning that if you are planning on visiting Ontario, and are heading up toward the Toronto area on the 401 highway this week.  The Ontario Provincial Police are cracking down on speeders.  For the first offense they are giving two tickets to the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game.  If you are stopped the second time they make you use them!!!!  "

142551,kennyman,2007-12-14 15:09:00,737,"I'll be the one going 120mph in my Buick Roadmaster wagon (yes,Grandma's on top). C'mon Leaf tickets. What a great Christmas present that would be!"
142555,keram,2007-12-14 15:16:00,585," You should not post this info. Ticket scalpers will be doing 200 km/hr + to get four instead of two. After paying fine and other court charges they will still make some money selling them to ""leafs fans"""
142567,Tybo,2007-12-14 15:42:00,1373,I can't afford to go to a leafs game!!  Going to put a restricter on the truck.  No more super cruise.
142570,Terry,2007-12-14 15:52:00,14456,LOL  the ticket may be free but who could afford to buy a hotdog or drink while you are there
