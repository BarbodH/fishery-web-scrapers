143005,bigfish1965,2007-12-16 06:33:00,3382,Weather is bad and expected to get worse. Don't come if you can avoid it.
143008,Dondorfish,2007-12-16 06:54:00,1000,"Just got in - came from Scarborough to St. Catharines - just under 2 hours. It's not as bad as I was expecting, but I sure wouldn't drive it if I didn't have to! Think Sunday will be a good day to spend some quaulity time with the wife - this way she won't complain when I head out ice fishing or snowmobiling!   Don"

143231,charlied,2007-12-16 23:10:00,584,ya good idea not heading out....about 8-10 inches in Fort Erie for me....shovelled the driveway twice today and will have to do it again soon.  But I love the snow so no big deal...stay at home and have fun.
