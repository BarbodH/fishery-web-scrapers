Nothing huge, but we each got about a dozen keepers, could have been more, but we were picky, waiting for the jumbos that never came.   A strange surprise on the walk out, I guess this girl went on a little bit too early, and the coyotes found her   A shot at the end of the day."

143248,steverowbotham,2007-12-16 23:51:00,1800,"never saw less than 4 inches, saw as much as 8 inches"
143250,steverowbotham,2007-12-16 23:52:00,1800,"that being said, there is still open water, stay away from it.  There were ATV's out there, but I wouldnt recommend it, ice thickness fluctuated greatly"
143410,DANIMAL,2007-12-17 16:06:00,215,"It was nice meeting you out there steve, a fun day for sure. A few more jumbos would have been really nice though."
