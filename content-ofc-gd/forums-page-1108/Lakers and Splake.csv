It will probably be guess work but any suggestions you have would be greatly appriciated  thanks!  James"
143402,irishfield,2007-12-17 15:53:00,26272,You may just wanna have a real close look at the regs before going for Lakers THIS TIME OF YEAR. Not too many opportunities out there... but I see oldphart found one.
143405,kingjames_2nd,2007-12-17 16:01:00,72,All of today's potential lakes are in the  additional fishing opportunities section with year round fishing allowed*.  Thanks for the concern though.  *except dec 24!
143408,Raf,2007-12-17 16:03:00,3495,"lakers can be anywhere in the water column this time of year.  wherevere there is food, you will find them.  they could be eating bugs/larvae/perch in the shallows or alewife out deep.  the key is to move around if you're not seeing anything - because they move around a lot."
143414,fishindevil,2007-12-17 16:10:00,6254,"Well for splake,i like to findthe edge of some weeds near deeper water,if you can find them,and set up right there,sometimes they act just like walleyes....around 15ft seems to be where they like to be in small tio medium sized lakes in the bancroft area ,and well for lakers,either keep moving around or find a point,or shoal,or dropoff,and set up there if you cant move around !!!!now anymore secrets and im going to send you a bill,for services rendered!!!!..LOL..LOL"
143429,oldphart,2007-12-17 16:36:00,665,"~~~Was out on Saturday after Lakers, there are lakes that have an open season on Lake Trout, not many but a few. the lake we hit the Trout we were hitting about 2' off the bottom, and we were marking them at 15' down tp 40'. They were hitting our Shiners hard and fast"
