The lake will remain closed to all activities until the first week of January, 2008, when ice depths will be surveyed. Check this site for updates on ice conditions and permitted activities.  Anyone caught on the ice before it is officially opened will be fined. Please note that snow machine travel anywhere in the Binbrook Conservation Area, including the reservoir, is prohibited at all times.  Please be patient as we wait for safe ice conditions and the start of another family program brought to you by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.   Please Note: The above ice conditions are provided for information purposes only and should not replace your own observations at the site. Ice conditions on the reservoir may change without warning due to weather conditions or reservoir operations. The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority recommends that all visitors make themselves aware of the existing ice conditions before venturing out onto the reservoir and practice ice safety at all times.
