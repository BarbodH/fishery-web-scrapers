Stayed in motels Saturday nights and parked the sleds right at the front doors.  I had to give it up about 10 years ago because of an injury but would sure like to be out there again in this kinda weather."

Rode it around  a country block almost back to the shop, it stopped, broke drive chain maybe. 15 minute ride, hour and a half putting on trailer and taking back, so back to reading forums. But I like the challenge, and better here than the middle of Lake Simcoe. Great day for snowmobiling."
143153,JohnF,2007-12-16 18:06:00,3494," Man, I hated doing chains on the old Skidoos. I always tried to hide whenever someone brought a sled in for a new track or chaincase work. And to make matters worse it was always a rush job so I was working on a cold wet sled. Wasn't so bad if we could bring it in the night before and have it all nice, warm and dry for the next day. Of course warm and dry was never an option at the race track.  JF"

143168,Tybo,2007-12-16 18:59:00,1373,Back in my race days. We would carry sheets of plastics to cover the hotel room. So we wouldn't get grease or oil all over the place.
