143098,bucktail,2007-12-16 15:43:00,1857,"Ver heavy in Burlington right now. Heavy drifting 200 yard visibilty. Hard to tell how much is snow and how much is blowing. Ice pellets this morning for ahile now its fluff snow, but man that wind is cold!"
143101,JohnF,2007-12-16 15:49:00,3494, Ditto. It seems to be building in intensity. Sure hope she has a cell phone.  JF
143118,ccmtcanada,2007-12-16 16:34:00,7971,401 Westbound at Kennedy Rd....all lanes closed!!! Be careful out there!!!
143121,JohnF,2007-12-16 16:44:00,3494," Just cleared about 10"" out of the drive but the drifts were deeper. It seems to have let up for now, still some drifting though. The wind is turning, I think. It was sorta southeast this morning which is rare for us. Normally it's out of the west. But it was tough figuring it out while I was blowing. Didn't seem to matter which way I aimed the chute it still blew it away, which I'm not complaining about.  JF"
143124,johnnyb,2007-12-16 16:58:00,3413,The flight is cancelled and so is my white knuckle trip to Hamilton Airport -- woooohooo!  Phase one of shovelling is complete and now it's time to take the rugrat tobogganing
143135,lew,2007-12-16 17:15:00,12767,"Well, I shovelled all the snow outta my driveway, trouble is, now it's all on me  "
143139,irishfield,2007-12-16 17:20:00,26272,Saved that picture for another day bud! LOL  All I care is that we can get out daughters boyfriend to Barrie in the next two hours....and that the bus is still running to get him back downtown Toronto!
143172,Clampet,2007-12-16 19:07:00,1947, I sense the the pull out bed is coming.
143178,Fisherman,2007-12-16 19:15:00,7201,"Heck, just keep him busy, cut the snow shovel in half, he should be pretty much burned out by bedtime, no hanky or panky left in him."
143179,Tybo,2007-12-16 19:16:00,1373,Got called in this moring. Had to boost a machine. When I was bring the other machine to boost from. I went around the corner and the machine went into a slide. Nothing like having a 267 thousand pound sliding out of control.
143209,Handlebarz,2007-12-16 21:58:00,3790,Yep it was a great excuse to miss the family Xmas party heck at 7am my daughter and I were off to buy a new tabogin it was going to be a santa gift but this could be all we get this year so I had to get it early well its time to head to work and clean my truck off and get it ready for 4am to battle the people in the am be safe out there blowing snow is worse then the fresh coming down.
143215,Mike the Pike,2007-12-16 22:12:00,3421,  Now I know where Bigfoot Lives  We are just getting pounded here in Quebec I was out for 2 hours this afternoon round 1 with the snowblower 2 hrs later and it looks like I was never out there.  I have to leave at 5:30 to take my daughter to soccer practice I thought for sure the coach would have cancelled but no we will be going  Hey Joey can I borrow your new toy
143249,Greencoachdog,2007-12-16 23:52:00,8163,  I've got a heavier jacket than that with a hood if you need to borrow one 'til Spring Lew!
143267,motv8tr,2007-12-17 00:36:00,2587,"Huh, is that you Lew???   I went to Toronto today, had a great time and got to see my little man   While the roads weren't great, I didn't find them horrible, and had no problems with visibility other than when I got stuck behind the plow coming home     Stopped at my friends on the way home and dropped off houses for her boys to decorate since they couldn't make it today.  I'll leave cleaning my driveway out until tomorrow morning.  Maureen"
143277,lew,2007-12-17 01:03:00,12767," Thanks  for the offer Dawg, but I'm fine with my coat, but would you happen to have something to keep the icicles off my moustache"
143278,Rizzo,2007-12-17 01:12:00,4754, We won't have visibility that good until april here in Barrie!  Its still snowing here and at a good pace too. My guess is we're closing in on 40-50 cms.  There were areas in my driveway that were in the 60 cm range already.  Shoveled 3 times plus the neighbour took a run at 'er with his snowblower.  I'm afraid what the morning will bring
143281,Greencoachdog,2007-12-17 01:15:00,8163,"  Funny you should mention it Lew, Granny just finished a brand new batch of the ""Medicine""!... It'll melt them icicles from the inside out!"
143023,lew,2007-12-16 12:45:00,12767,"I shovelled the snow about 5 this morning, but now it's coming down much harder and it looks like I never even touched it.  Sure hope nobody needs to travel too far on the hiways today.  Of course you all have good snow tires on your vehicles............don't you ??"
143024,nofrills,2007-12-16 12:49:00,89,"I'll be off to work in the morning. It will be interesting to see what effect this weather has on business. Sometimes bad weather makes for a slow day, sometimes a busy day. Considering that it's only a couple weeks till Christmas, I suspect we shall have a good day regardless! Mike"
143025,misfish,2007-12-16 12:49:00,29133,"Didnt get the snow as bad up here Lew,but the wind is making drifting a bit of a problem. 400 hwy seems to be in good shape as I took a drive this AM for something to do."
143026,Clampet,2007-12-16 12:50:00,1947,"I'll leave most in my dust (snow dust) with o'le worn out summer tires, cause I'm a true Northerner, have an itimate relationship with Mother nature an 'er ways."
143029,motv8tr,2007-12-16 13:01:00,2587,"Well I have plans to head into town to see some family and friends at an anuual gingerbread house decorating party for the kids.  Was supposed to bring my friend and her boys, but it looks like her husband has decided she can't go.  I'm also hoping to see my great nephew Ryan   If his mom decides to pass then so will I.  I don't need to leave here until 11:30-12:00 and figure by then the plows will have the highways clear...snowing here now, but a little snow never hurt anyone,  Maureen"
143030,fatherof3,2007-12-16 13:01:00,1769,just got back from a walk and the snow is starting to come down harder mixed with ice pellets so take it easy today
143033,Fisherman,2007-12-16 13:04:00,7201,"I applaud her husband for making an informed intelligent decision, especially when travel has been indicated as not advisable"
143035,motv8tr,2007-12-16 13:11:00,2587,Well no one ever accused me of being intelligent   I prefer to wait until it's closer to my departure time to make my decisions and a lot can happen between now and noon....I'm pretty sure Toronto has plows    and I think they plow the highways first    that's where most of my driving will be if I go.  maureen
143040,lew,2007-12-16 13:21:00,12767,"Hey Mo, have a close look at the Toronto forecast before you head down this way as I think were sposed to get another 6 - 10"" of snow today on top of what we already got overnight. It's also very windy and there appears to be some heavy drifting, infact I've got about 2' in my driveway and it was just shovelled a couple hours ago.  Just a heads-up for you."
143042,Crazyhook,2007-12-16 13:29:00,1154,"morning Lew!  everyone be careful out there, perfect day to stay home and watch some football"
143045,Chuck Best,2007-12-16 13:38:00,308,"It's snowing here in Alcona,and we got a couple of inches overnight......Gonna go out and clean up around here ,then it's off to do the parade thingy with my lions club..........TC all........"
143054,Greencoachdog,2007-12-16 14:17:00,8163,So I guess this means I shouldn't look for any Bananas with the little blue stickers that say Toronto this year eh Lew?
143057,OhioFisherman,2007-12-16 14:20:00,6623,"Not really a lot of snow here 3 inches maybe, it changed to rain, more snow expected later, for now we have the black ice warnings, nice!"
143058,Woodsman,2007-12-16 14:20:00,1286,Getting hit pretty hard down this way. Lots of snow. Low visibility & heavy drifting. They just closed most of the hwy's north & west of London due to the weather conditions.  Stay Safe: Rick
143063,Gerritt,2007-12-16 14:27:00,6129,"Hamilton mountain is getting slammed at the moment... Hamilton is set to break snowfall records with this storm, we are expected to receive more snow then most because we are on the west end on Lake Ontario, so we have to deal with lake effect snow as well...  Looks like I am going to have a busy ahead of me... 4 elderly neighbours and a single mother... Snowblower is going to get a workout...  G"
143065,Photoz,2007-12-16 14:34:00,792,"I live in the northeast end of the city . . . .    went across the road about 05:30 for my paper . . . . .     breathed a sigh of relief as the 6"" to 8"" we were supposed to get overnight was about 3""! However . . . .     about 09:00 I happened to look out my front window (14th floor) . . . .    it was like EVERYTHING disappeared . . . . .     the top of the school 300' away was barely visible!!    I got my coat & boots on, went out to the parking lot . ...    musta got another 4"" in the last few hours . . . .    shoulda done my grocery shopping YESTERDAY . . . . .    I thought maybe TWN had got their forecast from Vaselena . . . .   so I didn't pay much attention! Gonna be fun deliverin' the mail tomorrow! Neither rain nor hail nor sleet nor snow BE DAMNED!"
143072,lew,2007-12-16 14:48:00,12767," I believe the Toronto banana crop will survive this storm OK Glen, but we may have to do a bit of extra digging to get at them"
143075,Clampet,2007-12-16 14:50:00,1947,"I just got back from the No Frills, a mile away.  I was one of two people in the entire store. Made it back, by pumping on and off the gas pedal.  The side roads was a combo of keepin  enough speed tempered with the right braking. My Winter Driving Course begins soon. Enroll Now.  "
143080,motv8tr,2007-12-16 14:59:00,2587,"I'll be heading out in about an hour or so.  Talked to some relatives down there, and while there is snow on the roads, they haven't had any problems....just taking it slow is all.  Most of my driving will be on the highways so i'm hopeful that the plows would have been along a couple of times by the time I get down there.  Maureen"
143082,Clampet,2007-12-16 15:04:00,1947, Life is a series of choices we make. Enjoy yours.
143085,johnnyb,2007-12-16 15:09:00,3413,"Of all the days to pick my brother up at the airport, it has to be today.  And of all the airports it has to be Hamilton!  Ahhh well....I've got the flight status page bookmarked, and he's not supposed to land until 5:00pm, so maybe we'll get lucky and have a clear stretch of highway to get there and back."
143087,JFR,2007-12-16 15:17:00,498,"It's quite heavy now in Stroud.  When I got up at 600 this morning, other than wind there was no snow to speak of.  I just shoveled 4"" off my walkway, and the missus is shovelling the same amount from the back deck.  She is clearing away the BBQs so I can cook her supper  Stay save and don't drive unless it is absolutely necessary.  John"
143088,Grimace,2007-12-16 15:18:00,2020,"Guelph is getting hammered over here, don't think it is as bad as Hamilton, There has to be a foot out there already.   I was the only 1 in the Tim Horton's line this morning."
