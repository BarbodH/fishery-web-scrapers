142759,Rich Clemens,2007-12-15 12:14:00,3131,"They've already put up winter storm warnings for us here in south-central PA.  Not sure how much of the white stuff we are to get ... depends on which weather station you listen to.  Snow and sleet.  Looks like a mixed bag for us.  Up-state New York and New Englad, I believe, are looking for about 1 foot of snow.  Looks like a pretty big storm and covering a wide area."
142769,keram,2007-12-15 13:18:00,585,"latest update (snowfall)     Saturday Storm Snowfall Update (from accuweather blog) Saturday, December 15, 2007 Major snowstorm in the works from southern Ontario through southern Quebec and into northern New Brunswick. The expected track of this storm puts much of the region in a very favorable area for widespread heavy snow. Increasing northeast winds will cause moderate to heavy drifting through Sunday night. This will probably be one of the heaviest snowstorms in quite some time for parts of southwestern and eastern Ontario. Here are the new updated snowfall accumulations going up through Quebec. If anything, these updated forecasts for the London to Toronto to Ottawa region may still be not enough, but I want to see the next model run this afternoon. I will update areas farther east and northeast later today........   Windsor, Ont.......15-25 cm Saturday night into Sunday morning London, Ont.....15-25 cm Saturday night into Sunday am St. Catharines, Ont....30-40 cm Saturday night into Sunday, major blowing and drifting issues as well Hamilton, Ont........26-36 cm Saturday night into Sunday, major blowing and drifting. Kitchener, Ont......15-27 cm Saturday night into Sunday Toronto, Ont....23-35 cm Saturday night into Sunday Port Elgin, Ont......12-18 cm Saturday night into Sunday Barrie, Ont.....16-28 cm Saturday night into Sunday Bracebridge, Ont......14-24 cm Saturday night into Sunday Peterborough, Ont...24-35 cm Saturday night and Sunday Kingston, Ont....25-35 cm Saturday night and Sunday Ottawa, Ont.....20-30 cm late Saturday night into Sunday evening Cornwall, Ont......30-45 cm late Saturday night into Sunday evening  Montreal, Que.....28-40 cm Sunday and Sunday night Cowansville, Que...30-45 cm Sunday and Sunday night Sherbrooke, Que.....24-32 cm Sunday and Sunday night, higher elevations to the east 30-45 cm.

142780,ccmtcanada,2007-12-15 14:11:00,7971,YIKES!!! Thanks for the update Karem...I notice the increased forecasted amounts when I checked environment canada and the weather network.  Gonna be a fun one!!!!
142784,Greencoachdog,2007-12-15 14:38:00,8163,"The Gulf of Mexico moisture that is fueling that storm is our ""payback"" to y'all for letting that cold air creep down here!!!  Our high is only gonna be +6C tomorrow... y'all are screwin' up my fishin'!!!  "
142786,Beans,2007-12-15 15:01:00,3339,"I'm sort of half-assed looking forward to it...I'll get to use the new snow thrower Sandy Claws (my bro and sis-in-law) left in my garage last weekend...  They were afraid I might have a heart attack or screw up my back by shovelling snow this winter...  Earlier this week it only took me one hour to clean 5 inches off two cars, the whole driveway, open up the front of the driveway where the plow plugged it up and clear a path to the garbage box and to the propane tank out back of the garage...  BTW...25 cm divided by 5 then multiplied by 2 =10 inches...  Is that +6*F or C...Dawg"
142790,cranks bait,2007-12-15 15:17:00,721,"Woo HOO!!!  We're in the 30-45 range.  Jumped from 15 thismorning.  Love it.  Time to get out the snowshoes and shovel to build forts.  I mean, yucky snow what good are you...  If it's gonna be cold, might as well have the snow to go with it.  I miss the big snow days from when I was a kid."
142795,bucktail,2007-12-15 15:33:00,1857,Looks like they have really cranked the amount up. Now calling for 40-55 cm by monday for Burlington-St Cats and Hamilton. Problem is in the city there is no where to put the snow! The new FJ will make this a fun week. If you dont have to go anywhere sit at home and enjoy a good old fashioned Canadian blizzard!
142828,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-15 16:40:00,2585,Here in Oakville the snow is starting to build up.  Just started coming down heavier the last 20 minutes or so.    Cant wait I hope we get 2 feet!  lol be safe if you have to drive in this though!  Cheers!

142945,OhioFisherman,2007-12-16 00:50:00,6623,  LOL enough snow to build another Fort Erie!
142946,Greencoachdog,2007-12-16 00:57:00,8163,  I thought those were extinct?... killed off by Global Warming....
143001,HTHM,2007-12-16 06:07:00,4082,Oh no it is gonna snow BD We're in Canada accept it and go on!
143012,huntervasili,2007-12-16 08:40:00,1604,"Snowing good in Burlington now... Just got back from my shift... only about 3"" but its coming down heavier every hour... started as small compact icy flakes but is now fluffy like. Drive safe all... It can be dangerous out there"
143253,Mike the Pike,2007-12-16 23:59:00,3421,The weather channel says we are getting 50cms now here in Montreal.  its Brutal outside I spent 2hrs clearing snow earlier today and it now looks like I have done nothing.  Living in Canada never a dull moment.I bet they don't sell many shovels in ALABANANA  
143257,Greencoachdog,2007-12-17 00:08:00,8163, Shovel?... what's a shovel???
143274,Clampet,2007-12-17 00:50:00,1947,I beleive the 'mericans only use farenheit.
143309,douG,2007-12-17 04:29:00,2693," I have a feeling that Glen meant 6C.  After all, he said 6C.  Very unlikely to see 6 F in Alabananas, although it did dip to -27F way back in '66,  so it could happen.  That would be around -33 C, the rednex musta been putting on t shirts all over the place."
142510,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-12-14 13:33:00,0,"Hi guys,  just a headsup that 25cm snow is coming to Hamilton & Toronto Area ...  Damn it, I was planning to go fishing @ Niagara Region this weekend ... Who else is crazy enough to go!"
142512,ccmtcanada,2007-12-14 13:36:00,7971,Yep...here's the weather watch from Environment Canada....no driving for me Saturday night/Sunday!  Stay safe!  =================================================================== ..Major winter storm approaching Saturday..  This is an alert to the potential development of dangerous winter weather conditions in these regions. Monitor weather conditions..Listen for updated statements.  A major winter storm will develop in Texas later today and make its way north towards southwestern Ontario Saturday afternoon. Significant snowfall accumulations over the regions are likely Saturday night through Sunday. It is possible winter storm warnings will be issued for some regions due to snowfall accumulations of 25 centimetres in less than 24 hours. There will also be significant blowing snow and possibly freezing rain over the regions.  The snow will spread northward over most of southern Ontario Saturday night and through Sunday morning. This will make travel on the roads extremely hazardous and travel should be postponed or alternate travel arrangements should be considered.  The winter storm watch may be extended northward and eastward once the exact track of the storm and the extent of the snowfall is determined.
142513,Raf,2007-12-14 13:38:00,3495,cool. get to try the new tires on the heep.
142517,solopaddler,2007-12-14 13:51:00,8605,"Saturday should be fine, Sunday looks a bit iffy though..."
142518,Greencoachdog,2007-12-14 13:53:00,8163,My goodness that sounds nasty!  It's going to be XX*F (censored) here to day!  Would 25 cm be anywhere near 9 13/16 inches? Or is it closer to 2.5 decimeters?.. but I know it's not even close to 250 mm.  My head hurts!!!
142521,fishing n autograph,2007-12-14 13:56:00,2540,"great, nothing like a snowstorm and a night shift....lol...another 2+ hour drive home!"
142522,Gerritt,2007-12-14 13:59:00,6129,Toronto will be spared... Windsor to Hamilton though is a completely different story according to the news..  G
142523,Terry,2007-12-14 14:01:00,14456,well we don't need any snow here  we need clear skies and calm winds to make lots of ice
142525,Headhunter,2007-12-14 14:03:00,5703,"Well that kicks the crap out of my Sunday plans to try and hit the Q again... I wonder how the ""Warden"" would feel about fishin on Xmas Eve! LOL HH"

142591,motv8tr,2007-12-14 16:57:00,2587,"psht, how many times have they said this and then nothing happened?  Even their idea of a ""bad"" storm isn't that bad...sheesh.  If it comes, it will come and likely won't be as bad as they are saying..heck, they'll likely change their minds 4-5 , more times...won't know for sure until Sunday morning...no matter what, my plans won't change  Maureen"
142594,Gerritt,2007-12-14 17:07:00,6129,  Get the dogs hooked up to the dogsled moe! the world is coming to an end! LOL
142603,iceguy,2007-12-14 17:43:00,341,"I notice it is not usually as bad as they predicted, or it's a lot worst then they predicted(this is years of snowremovle experience) I hope it's 5cm of lightstuff. 25 cm is army calling kinda of snow fall."
142605,keram,2007-12-14 17:50:00,585,"Considering accuracy   of the forecasts, I'm going to predict tht we will have somwhere between 5 - 55 cm . But I can be wrong"
142628,Guest Fishing For Life,2007-12-14 19:20:00,0,"Hi there,  just curious about one thing  how do you guys meet up in real life? I have got so much information from this board and havent had a chance to actually meet you guys in person ...  lets say i am going Queenston .. how do i know who is who? should I have a book in my hand?  Cheets!"
142629,ccmtcanada,2007-12-14 19:26:00,7971, I usually wear this hat when I'm fishing with others from this board.....   I will usually meet up with the other person at a pre-determined time and location...do some introductions and then head off to fish.  I'll tell them what kind of car I drive etc...  Good luck!
142639,huntervasili,2007-12-14 20:20:00,1604,"you're not wearing a hat in that picture Cliff, come to think of it you're being held by a guy I saw once at one of the fishing shows...  Believe me it can  be tough, everyone is less pleasant looking in real life  thats what I noticed with the guys at the BOQ G2G anyway... Pixels really help hide hideousness"
142653,Headhunter,2007-12-14 20:56:00,5703,I resemble that remark Bill! HH
142706,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-15 00:23:00,2585,im looking forward to it!!!!  tomorrow is a home day and sunday my wife and i are doing a cpr course like 10 minutes from home.  It sure will be nice to be close to home for a change when snow comes.  Cheers!
142717,Greencoachdog,2007-12-15 01:56:00,8163,  ... said the boy known as Pixel Parker!
142738,lookinforwalleye,2007-12-15 04:07:00,4399,25 cm`s thats pretty close to Canadian Forces time for you city slickers.  With all the people I see driving in the GTA without winter tires and worn out summer tires It will in no doubt be an adventure.  If you have to drive have a care and say a prayer to those that are too cheap to buy some snow tires.
142758,OhioFisherman,2007-12-15 12:09:00,6623,25 cm? LOL you guys were in trouble when you ran out of feets! Up to 10 inches (5/6 of a foot) expected here.
