143400,pikehunter,2007-12-17 15:50:00,1659,"LOL, not too many holes to be drilled down in your neck of the woods is there?  A drill would get awful rusty waiting for the ice to form."
143413,wallyboss,2007-12-17 16:09:00,1095,"Most places don't rent augers, because people used to rent them for a weekend and just go around and charge 2.00 per hole and make a killing and damage the shops augers."
