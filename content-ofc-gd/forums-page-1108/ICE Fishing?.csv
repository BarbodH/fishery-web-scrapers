142584,huntervasili,2007-12-14 16:29:00,1604,"Simcoe perch action can be pretty fun. Its nice to be catching a bunch of fish to keep you warm as they arent the toughest fish to catch or find... Cooks bay will hopefully soon have huts out on it, by the new year it should be really safe with all operators going, at this rate anyway..."
142600,PERCHER,2007-12-14 17:37:00,787,I second Simcoe perch for a  first timer.Lots of action.
142618,wuchikubo,2007-12-14 18:13:00,1114,"Although I don't normally target perch, Simcoe's perch will get my vote for the first time ice fishing experience. I believe Virginia beach area has huts out right now on 5+"" of black ice (I heard reports)."
142625,Rich,2007-12-14 18:47:00,3927,Could try Binbrook C.A. if it's open this year for ice fishing?
142687,misfish,2007-12-14 22:57:00,29133,Quick turn on the A channel ICE FISHING
142697,Fisherman,2007-12-14 23:50:00,7201,I think she said up around Bancroft somewhere.  And then the little tart is riding with NO helmet on the skidoo.
142724,sonny,2007-12-15 02:24:00,511,"I second binbrook conservation for the simple reason is that they won't let you on the ice untill it's definatly safe,,or go with a hut operator up at simcoe,,,,no need for beginners to be heading out on new ice,,,just my opinion,,,,don't want to see anyone hurt is all"
143463,hi09,2007-12-17 17:57:00,46, you are refering to binbrook over in hamilton area right - yea i called they will start fishing later on in january
143518,kellyann.nicholas,2007-12-17 20:40:00,6,A great place to try is little Puslinch Lake as well as Big Puslinch Lake.  I was out there on Saturday with my husband and there is a good 6 inches of clear ice and another 4 of white ice. and there was a lot of Pike action all day as well as some perch.
