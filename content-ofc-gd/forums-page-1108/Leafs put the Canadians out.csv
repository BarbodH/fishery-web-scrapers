142900,misfish,2007-12-15 22:18:00,29133,"Well they did in game five,1963. I just watched a great classic April 04th 63. A year and 13 days, before I was born.  Boy could that Shack fly.  Stars of the game  Dave Keon Johhny Bower Dick Duff  I would say the boys in Montreal are a bit worried now."
142903,charlied,2007-12-15 22:35:00,584,"Well if the leafs can stay out of the penalty box which they have been as of late, then they should have no problem tonight."
142912,vance,2007-12-15 22:49:00,719,To bad you missed the game it was a goood one.watched it with my friend who was a habs fan  vance
142918,muskymatt,2007-12-15 23:13:00,2608,Wasn't that around the last time they won the cup  Losers Even After Forty Seasons
142942,holdfast,2007-12-16 00:19:00,1813,"Clash of the Titans tonite.  Hard Hitting, Fighting, End to end action, few penalties only Majors.  Great Canadian Hockey.  Flashbacks."
142943,Mike the Pike,2007-12-16 00:27:00,3421,  Ya I was 2 when the leafs last one the Cup.  I was at the Stanley Cup Parade in 1993 before the Habs fans thrashed the city of Montreal.  Its always a close game between these 2 teams.
142944,Clampet,2007-12-16 00:33:00,1947,Yeah...you had me goin' there fer a minute.
143007,carp-starter,2007-12-16 06:53:00,253,"Ya, the Habs and Leafs games are close games. Yesterday, the Leafs at the end of the game had to score only 4 more goals to win the game. I am calling it a close game -  Now muskymatt, do not say ""Losers Even After Forty Seasons"". We must be nice to the Leafs. Let us say that the Leafs have been ""re-building"" since 1967 (their last Stanley Cup). It really gets interesting when the front office has also been re-building during most of this period of time.  But muskiematt, you are correct - they are losers. When a team is a loser 40 years ago, losers today and losers for 38 years in between, one can hontstly say - LOSERS  carp-starter"
