142682,Vanselena,2007-12-14 22:33:00,269,LOL Rizzo too funny!
142908,Vanselena,2007-12-15 22:41:00,269," Hey Photoz I think you need a hobby,,,lol"
141990,Vanselena,2007-12-12 17:29:00,269,Saw this post and thought I would share it!  http://gofishont.com/wowbbforum/forum1/664.html
141994,Terry,2007-12-12 17:40:00,14456,"maybe it's just me  but I would rather see someone post the info  rather then a link to another website.....  it makes me ask,  are they posting  to add to this website or to get people to the website at the other end of the link....a different website, which I am sure would like move hits....  but that's just me"
141997,keram,2007-12-12 17:45:00,585,"This reminds me a methods perfected by "" Peter Pike"""
142002,misfish,2007-12-12 17:57:00,29133,"Terry didnt you say you had shares with them????????????????LOL  I WOULD SAY JUST POST THE INFO NOT THE LINK.  WHAT EVER,THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP."
142005,Terry,2007-12-12 18:04:00,14456,"hey, I could be wrong but it's starting to look like a pattern we have seen before  I was wrong once before what year was that...LOL"
142006,Vanselena,2007-12-12 18:10:00,269,Sorry but it's easier for me to post a link then to copy the image then photobucket it ...etc besides it was simply a heads up of something I saw and thought would be nice to share.
142012,Terry,2007-12-12 18:39:00,14456,"see, like I said I could be wrong  but I am sure you can see our point that it can become more about getting people to a different site ....  ... it's a  fine line and slippery slope.....LOL"
142014,keram,2007-12-12 18:48:00,585," Psychic or what  . I just hurt my arse (I love this censorship - original version was changed to ""donkey""   )walking a dog on an ice covered sidewalk"
142028,bassman,2007-12-12 20:00:00,384,Boy are you guys sensitive or what..god forbid we go to another site.
142030,Terry,2007-12-12 20:06:00,14456,no but there are lots of people and we have sure seen it before where people just post to link to other sites to get traffic and try to take visitor/members from this site. or to promote their services ......   let them build their own membership OFC doesn't need to build it for them  as I said this may not be the case here but I thought that I would get the heads up........  there are guys that pay for the great bandwidth that this site uses and to maintain it and I would hate to see it become a portal to everyone elses wet dream site...
142033,misfish,2007-12-12 20:08:00,29133," I just was at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Never mind.It,s not important.LOL"
142036,bassman,2007-12-12 20:15:00,384,Sounds like someone needs to get out fishing.
142044,misfish,2007-12-12 20:29:00,29133," LOL Soon,very soon."
142071,Rizzo,2007-12-12 21:42:00,4754,I hear Simcoe is hot right now
142080,irishfield,2007-12-12 22:06:00,26272,"LOL.. click his profile and see what he's posted lately. I think Terry is spot on, on the traffic sway.... and he already fishes more than most around here I may add!"
142086,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-12 22:25:00,1351,"Luuuuccyyyyyyy, you got some explainin' to do!"
142107,bassman,2007-12-12 22:58:00,384,hmmm..... 
142110,irishfield,2007-12-12 23:02:00,26272,Hey I recognize Terry on the right and me on the left... but who's the hotty in the middle...is that Joey?
142114,Beans,2007-12-12 23:14:00,3339,Strange you mention that Terry...way back in early 2002 (I think it was) through someone posting a link to the OFC site on the original Fishing Lake Simcoe board is how I dicovered this site...I wonder how many of us found our way here via that way...  I do understand what you are saying and have noticed some of the other sites now veto posting of sites altogether...so times have changed but I don't think OFC has anything to worry about...  OFC is the first site I go to after I've checked the weather and read my mail...then maybe check out a couple of other sites if time permits...
142186,Mike the Pike,2007-12-13 01:54:00,3421,Who bleached those white perch
142188,FishFinder,2007-12-13 02:00:00,481,"  LOL, im sending you the bill for my keyboard!!!!"
142235,Greencoachdog,2007-12-13 04:27:00,8163," Yeah, I hope those things have been scaled... if not they're in pretty rough shape, not something I'd wanna eat.  Have they been setting in a 5 gallon bucket in the hut all day???"
142244,Photoz,2007-12-13 09:35:00,792,I'm surprised there wasn't any mention of the Vaseline Flasher (the one that 'for sure' that would be in production this year?) those perch were likely located with . . . .    likely on full power & it whitened them up . . . .     oh yeah . . . .     lets not forget the Vaseline Weather Predicting Service . . . . .    forecasts-while-you-wait! The best is yet to come though . ...   we still haven't had a 'report' from 'Musky Pete' eh?
142343,cityfisher,2007-12-13 17:53:00,959,its too early and unsafe for me right now .. i wont be on the lake till after xmas.... i aint one to risk my ass over some perch
142408,Rizzo,2007-12-13 23:46:00,4754, hmmm...a naked dude running around with vaseline.  Definitely staying out of his way
