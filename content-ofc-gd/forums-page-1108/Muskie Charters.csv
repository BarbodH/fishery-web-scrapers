135522,mistaredone,2007-11-21 15:54:00,913,Can anyone recommend a good muskie charter?  What should I expect to spend?  I'm looking to get out maybe next Wednesday or the one after that with a buddy.  I cant wait to get off the river banks and back onto solid ground (a boat) lol.  Thanks for any help.
135523,irishfield,2007-11-21 15:57:00,26272,Not sure of any that will get you out on that short of notice. Where do you want to go...that will help people point you in the right direction. Single days outing....approx $400 to $500
135532,Pigeontroller,2007-11-21 16:29:00,2793,The Kawarthas are closed so that rules out several in that area...
135541,lew,2007-11-21 16:51:00,12767,"Don't know if either is still guiding this time of year or not, but if you want to travel to Montreal, Marc Thorpe is an excellent choice.  I can't get the link for him to work but you can contact him thru this board.  Richard Collins is in the Ottawa area and is also a great choice  www.trophymuskiecharters.com  I've fished with both of them, would recommend them both,  and either one can put you on monster fish."
135546,Gerritt,2007-11-21 17:02:00,6129,I hear that there is a guy named Lew that sure knows how to boat em  G
135547,misfish,2007-11-21 17:02:00,29133,"I hear the best deal is on ST.CLAIR.They use many rods and you up your chance,s 4 fold. Sorry,Im just in a good mood today.LOL"
135550,hawkeye,2007-11-21 17:12:00,162,Try Stacy at http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/  Haven't seen him in a few years but he always gave me a good solid 8 hours somewhere around $300 but that might have gone up
135552,lew,2007-11-21 17:14:00,12767,"  And I hear he works for free, too"
135559,Sebastian,2007-11-21 17:29:00,208,"My good friend Simon is a guide. He guides for all species but a serious muskie fanatic. I know he will guide on short notice for a good price. Just give him a call at 416 255 4739.  We fished together on Sunday for some muskie and we found them with tough conditions. Got a few muskie, some pike, a rainbow plus a few monster muskie follows. Here are a few pics.  Small one   Nice surprise   and the fatty of the day:    Sebastian"

135564,Bob Devine,2007-11-21 17:40:00,251,Lake St. Clair is open until Dec 15. I guide and so does Jon Bondy www.lakestclairfishing.com. Jon casts and jigs I also include trolling with the casting and jigging.

135715,Pigeontroller,2007-11-21 23:36:00,2793,"Contact Stacy Ash, he's in your area, and there are some nearby Muskie lakes that I think are open till Dec. 15  www.protacklemuskyshop.com"
135722,Dave Frasso,2007-11-21 23:47:00,20," Collins Lake, is out Division Street approx. 14.Kms north of 401 Lake Ontario in front of Kingston Rideau River (most of it) St.Lawrence River just east of Kingston St.Lawrence River Gananoque area  Lots more I'm sure   Good Luck"
135723,Dave Frasso,2007-11-21 23:47:00,20,"  Collins Lake, is out Division Street approx. 14.Kms north of 401 Lake Ontario in front of Kingston Rideau River (most of it) St.Lawrence River just east of Kingston St.Lawrence River Gananoque area  Lots more I'm sure   Good Luck  Dave"
135754,Smokey,2007-11-22 00:45:00,1278,"There are quite a few guides out your way just have to search a bit on the net and you'll find there info. From there it's just a matter of picking a body of water you want to fish give it a go.  The only guide I have experience with out that way is Richard Collins out of Ottawa as Lew suggested, I had a great few days on the water with him and would recommend him.  Good Luck and I hope you boat some fish, there sure is a few being caught lately."

135802,mistaredone,2007-11-22 02:10:00,913,"I'm willing to travel so lake choice is not a factor.  I thought Kawarthas muskie season went till Nov 30th but I am probably wrong.  Thanks to everyone for the great response, I now have a lot of research to do on everyones tips.  I appreciate the help."
135865,moemoe,2007-11-22 05:32:00,352,"Go lake st.clair and I'll second Bob devine, He put us on fish and decent rates too"
143119,Clausewitz,2007-12-16 16:34:00,19,"Depending on where people are going, I'd like to give a shout out for Kert Lavigne who guides for Muskie on the Ottawa River.  http://www.muskiestalker.ca/    I've gone out with Kert and he is both a great guy and very knowledgeable.  Clausewitz"
