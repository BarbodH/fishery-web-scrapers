When I was a single mom many years ago...25 in fact...I had taken in my younger brother who was in bad shape..anyhow, we were down to one pickle in a jar and one can of baby formula...it was January 1983, I had overspent on Christmas.  We laughed about the pickle but at the same time I was worried about feeding my baby.  It would be another week before the government check came... I was proud, too proud to ask for help...so I prayed instead. It was a day or two later that I received a letter in the mail.  It was from a guy I had met the summer prior and when I told him at that time that I was pregnant, I never heard from him again until that day.  He wrote me an apology letter and sent a check for $40.00 I was floored.  God does work in mysterious ways."
