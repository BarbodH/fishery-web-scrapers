451397,Sinker,2010-04-03 18:22:00,8692,  Are you talking about me
451405,fish-miester,2010-04-03 18:38:00,864,ya I found 3 crappie through the ice this year.. and already have x that by 100
451412,Big Cliff,2010-04-03 19:13:00,6899,"Good news sure travels fast. I went there this afternoon after fixing the marine railway and getting the boat out of storage. When I got there, there were already 5 other boats all in a small area. I didn't bother staying, I'll get out early tomorrow and get a nice feed of them."
451577,buckster,2010-04-04 13:29:00,530,Nice haul!   I know where that is lol .... Who wants to go?
451588,Big Cliff,2010-04-04 14:13:00,6899,"Blue gills were hitting like crazy this morning, crappie were few and far between, I think the high wind and cold front might have slowed them down a bit. I did get a few for a feed though. Saw two other boats in there about the same results."
451601,dave524,2010-04-04 14:50:00,4508,"Nice haul and great size. I always do best over a black bottom very early, the waters warm more quickly there especially on a sunny day, look shallow and over black muck bottoms."
451777,Big Cliff,2010-04-04 23:09:00,6899,"Jer, thanks for sending me that recipe, I will be trying it this week."
451243,Sinker,2010-04-03 03:33:00,8692,"I took my son and a friends daughter out for some spring slab action this afternoon. Once we got on them, it was non stop action. These two had a blast. They wanted to do everything themselves today, so other than a couple tough hook removals, I let them have atter. There was quite the competition going on with these two!! We kept 30 12""ers, and released many more that size and bigger! Great action and a ton of fun for the kids.......we had a great day!!    Awesome average size!!    Great weather, great company, some monster slabs, and a HUGE fish fry at the end of the day.......does it get any better???  S."
451244,irishfield,2010-04-03 03:36:00,26272,Great stuff Shayne.. love the hold! Saw the pic earlier and thought they were brother/sister !

451292,Big Cliff,2010-04-03 11:33:00,6899,"Nice haul, did you get over to the place we talked about? I'm thinking of trying there today."
451295,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-03 11:55:00,1362,Nice slabs!!
451302,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-03 12:15:00,2582,"Nice pics of the kids and the ""cooler o slabs"". Sounds like an awesome day. Heading out the door at 9 for Scugog to try and find some slabs ourselves.  Thx for sharing your day Shayne. I never get tired of seeing Jacob smiling and holding up fish for a picture."
451306,limeyangler,2010-04-03 12:26:00,5204,"What a result!  great report there Sinker, nice haul of slabs!"

451314,Jer,2010-04-03 13:08:00,1426,It's really nice to see an early crappie bite. We were on Buckhorn yesterday and did fairly well once we found the right spot.  The fruits of our labours:    Yummy...
451315,canuckjack,2010-04-03 13:09:00,121,"That's really cool, always great to see such happy kids."
451316,Sinker,2010-04-03 13:11:00,8692,"Atta boy Jer! Nice work!!  We found them to be pretty isolated too. If you weren't casting within a 15ft circle, you didn't get bit.  It took a while to find them, but once we did, it sure was fun!!! Couldn't catch one to save our life anywhere else, just this one little hole.  S."
451328,fish-miester,2010-04-03 13:59:00,864,awesome ! good to hear every one had fun ! I was out there the past two days and the bite has been pretty good. just gota find them!
451373,skeeter,2010-04-03 16:00:00,1907,nice catch !!!!! wait till all the kawartha ice fishers read this post---LOL they were hunting for them all season long and you go out with 2 kids and slam them... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
451376,Sinker,2010-04-03 16:36:00,8692,"Hey, I'm a kawartha icefisherman too!! I couldn't find the little buggers through the ice though!!! They're a lot easier to find when you have different temps in the water!!  S."
451380,ehg,2010-04-03 16:41:00,2666,Great report! Looking forward to the same thing now the ice is gone.
