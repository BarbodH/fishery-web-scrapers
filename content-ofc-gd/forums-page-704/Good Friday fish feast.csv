I have some pics, but the camera is being as fussy right now and doesn't want to download.  Nevertheless, suffice it to say, if you get a chance to get out on this wonderful weekend, go for it! The bite is on.  Why were we denied this opportunity for ice-out crappie for so long?  I figgered out the camera:      ...on the BBQ:    ...mmm...bacon wrapped crappie delights:  "
451121,misfish,2010-04-03 00:39:00,29133,"Today was an AWESOME day to be out. Sounds like you had a great day and a feed to boot.  We had Cod filets and fries. Oh, there was malt vinigar and gravy.LOL    Thanks for sharing Jer."
451133,Beans,2010-04-03 00:51:00,3339,"After taking a couple of pics (see going...going...going...GONE !) on this beauty of a day the good Lord has given us, I wet a line for half an hour but it was too windy to notice any bites so I wandered home and baked some sole fillets with some pan fries for supper."

451148,Mykester,2010-04-03 01:05:00,241,"Same, I also had some luck with a few crappie, didn't take any pics though."
451183,GoneFishin,2010-04-03 01:51:00,349,"I finally got out today for some and we had constant action the whole time. Got a couple nice ones. Was an awesome day day, except for all the crap hawks! ie. people in boats moving in on your spot 10 feet from where you are fishing after seeing you catch fish!!!.... give me a break!!..    "
451335,fish-miester,2010-04-03 14:07:00,864,"good stuff guys ! me and my 4 buddies caught our limits.. and had a Fish FEAST! some bbq'd some deep fried.. cut up some potatoes to make some home fries  = Dee-Lish !  and ya ""Gonefishin"" I hate that .. happend to me twice the past two days..lets just say I wasnt a happy camper..!"
451372,GoneFishin,2010-04-03 15:55:00,349, I just wish I had a casting outfit on me lol. They would have lost a couple lures lol....

451433,Big Cliff,2010-04-03 20:44:00,6899,"I hear you on that one, two years ago no one fished the spot where I like to go. This year I get there and there are 5 boats, I guess they figure it is their spot now. I didn't bother staying. I'll go when there is no one else around.  BTW, I wouldn't mind that bacon wrapped recipe! Boy that looks good."
451445,fish-miester,2010-04-03 21:09:00,864,   agreed ! it looks delicious
451744,Jer,2010-04-04 21:33:00,1426,"   It's really quite simple, roll up your panfish fillets (or you can cut up walleye fillets into smaller strips), wrap them in a 1/2 a slice of bacon, pin with a toothpick, and spritz them with some Italian dressing.  Bake them at 350 to 400 on the BBQ for about 15 to 20 minutes or until the bacon is cooked to your liking.  Enjoy."
451751,splashhopper,2010-04-04 21:51:00,2931,"  That sounds so simple that I might be able to cook that....  Now, if I can just find the stove"
