When the ice goes out, the big northerns come into spawn and I had my camera and ofc sign ready to add to the team 3 total.  I only got one fish and I was going to take it's picture to add to the team total but when I put it beside my sign , the sign was bigger and I don't know if our team captain has a sense of humour, so I just released the fish. Anyway, I don't know how many points you get for a 5 inch perch.  Just the same, I feel like I have started the spring fishing season, just a little slowly thats all."
