450381,Aaron Shirley,2010-03-31 14:50:00,655,"I just logged on to OFC with my Blackberry, and got redirected to OFC mobile. This is great, as most of my time to get on-line these days is with my phone. I don't have much time to get on-line at home anymore. Most large sites have this feature now, but I think this is a first for a fishing forum.  Well done boys!  Aaron"
