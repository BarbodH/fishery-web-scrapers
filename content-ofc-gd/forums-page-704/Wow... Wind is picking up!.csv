451476,Fisherman,2010-04-04 01:24:00,7201,"Ya, went from a light breeze to over 70k winds in two minutes.  If you were done raking the lawn, better look again in the morning, probably inherited the neighbours pile of leaves. Only a light rain now, temps went from 26 to 16 in short order."
451477,irishfield,2010-04-04 01:33:00,26272,Yep.. went from 26C to 12 C in a matter of minutes.. from no wind to I thought I was gonna lose the hangar in the snap of the fingers just before dark. Rained enough to say it did.. not enough to wash my truck or make the ground stay wet. Stars are out now.. Hope nobody got a tornado.. it had that look to it earlier..
