As I was setting up my float rod in typical fashion on his 2nd cast I hear ""Fish on"". His namesake showed up.    Such nice colors.    We drifted roe and marabou jigs and enjoyed the sun and finally some superior steel.      I can't think of a better way to enjoy a hot spring day."

451636,TDunn,2010-04-04 16:00:00,680,Nice work boys! Mixed bag of chrome and brookies is always nice. What a weekend we are having. I havent fished much this weekend but its game on starting tomorrow for a few days... We just installed a Garmin 400c in my cousins boat and are about to begin installing a 70# minnkota bow mount this week sometime. I havent posted a report in sometime so I'll work on getting one up for the board soon.  Next weekend the rivers will be in prime conditions by the looks of things....    TDunn
451638,Kinger,2010-04-04 16:06:00,351,I can't wait to hit the rivers after this rain we FINALLY got.  I definitely needed a little water in my waders to deal with the heat!
