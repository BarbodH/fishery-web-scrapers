Today I finally got around to starting on the project.  I went and tore the benches out of it today and tomorrow I will be buying some wood, sealer and carpet to replace them with.  I also plan on painting the inside of the boat using some rockerguard.  I snapped a few pics to try document the progress of the project.  This is how it sat before I got into it today.     My girlfriend got a pic of me while I was working, at least she got my good side!!     After getting the seats unscrewed and torn out.    All ready for powerwashing, scuffing/sanding and painting.     That's all I got done today, stay tuned for more ""in progress"" reports.  Hopefully I'll have it ready to hit the water in a couple of weeks.   Ryan"

451879,SBCregal,2010-04-05 02:13:00,688,"yeah... i know it wont be DONE in a couple of weeks, but it will be READY for the water in a couple of weeks hell, if i had plans to get out anytime soon i'd toss the motor on it as it sits and head out! heeheh  i know it never ends  ryan"
451920,HTHM,2010-04-05 03:02:00,4082,"Before the discouraging words start, keep up the good work, and do not let the naysayers on the board bring ya down. I would suggest that the seats are a part of the structure of the hull. They need to be in the boat to maintain the ridgity of the hull in rough water. How are you planning to address that?"
451929,SBCregal,2010-04-05 03:19:00,688,"I'm not worried about any naysayers, I know how projects like this go.  I've had several project cars over the years, one even got finished!  I know the seats are part of the structure and need to be in there.  I was kinda joking about taking it out.  I took the seats out today to use them as templates to cut new seats.  This was just a ""part one"" of the process, the work I got done today  Ryan"
451957,GoneFishin,2010-04-05 04:26:00,349, Lmao!!! I've been thinking about all of that and more the last couple weeks.... I just want to fish!! lol.....
