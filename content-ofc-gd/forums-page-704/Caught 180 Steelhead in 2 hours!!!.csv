451457,laszlo,2010-04-03 21:42:00,487,To be completely honest...I got skunked in the morning but then Fidel and I headed to help CRAA lift a bunch of Steelhead at the dam. Hats off to everyone involved. Some serious labour to get those fish where they need to be.   PREP        That's me in the green shirt 'working very hard'                 Fidel was in Steelhead Heaven. I was afraid he would never leave the depths of fishy maddness.     Another wicked day outside. Love it! Would say more but I'm exhausted. Thanks for reading.  Laz

451509,laszlo,2010-04-04 02:44:00,487,I think the longest fish measured 80cm and was in the 12-14lb range. Many between 8-10lbs and most were 5-7lbs.  My arms are going to kill tomorrow.
