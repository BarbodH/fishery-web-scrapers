450989,pikehunter,2010-04-02 16:18:00,1659,"Good lookin' perch Dave!  I think I'm very familiar with that location, actually I thought it may be a little early for perch at that spot but guess I was wrong. Wife and I were going to go down this morning, got the boat all ready for the season yesterday, except for gas that is, but something came up around the house and we never got moving.  Thanks for sharing the mouthwatering pictures."

451277,pikehunter,2010-04-03 10:04:00,1659," Thinking   the same thing Dave. Maybe Sunday, gotta go to work this morning for 7.  Damn! If I'd only listened to my father I too would have been retired by now"
