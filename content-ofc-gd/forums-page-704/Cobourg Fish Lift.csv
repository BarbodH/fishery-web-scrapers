Too bad I didn't know you were coming or I would have said ""hello"".  Had a great turnout once again. We lifted 200 rainbow between 9 and 11. Keeping in mind, the first hour was to rush the river up to get the bows in the pool.  Went like clock work once again!  Thanks to all that helped.  Cheers, Ron..."

I had to guide the basket from the bottom and entertain the biologist. (they get bored easy)  Here are some of my photos, you will notice the ATV Ron sat on all morning while everyone else worked.  http://s867.photobucket.com/albums/ab233/Angler_friend/Cobourg-Fish-Lift/  Thank you to all the helped.  Some beautiful fish went up and over today and lots left in the pool when we finished. 200 fish lifted over, not a single clipped fish...all naturals."
