451387,The JAY,2010-04-03 17:40:00,239,"I love canoe fishing for pike! You can always tell how good of a fish it is by how much it pulls the boat... Hehehe... We always frive 7 hours North fir pike. Maybe I'll start looking in the back yard for them! They're obviously there. Nice fish, and great pictures."

450336,4thgen,2010-03-31 12:50:00,157,"Nice pike!  The girth on that thing is unreal.  Looks like that tail treble is down in the gills -- I know that sight well, that fish must have just inhaled it.  I can't wait to get out and get some great lakes pike of my own. Last year the ice was gone about a month from now, this year we've had a warmer spring so I'm keeping my fingers crossed!"
