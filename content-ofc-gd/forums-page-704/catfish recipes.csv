451560,oxcowboy,2010-04-04 12:34:00,544,"As stated above, you cant go wrong with fish crisp.  I also like it wrapped in tinfoil with butter and lemon pepper seasoning cooked on the grill. good luck and enjoy.  jason"
451657,Big Cliff,2010-04-04 17:00:00,6899,"We use to just cut down the back to the ribs then out to the skin. Cut the skin away then slice the fillet cross ways so you have chunks sort of like scalops (about 1"" thick). Soak them in cold salted water over night in the fridge. Drain and rinse in cold water then drain well or pat dry.  Dip them in an egg wash, then toss them in a bag with seasoned flour (season to your liking). (or use fish crisp) Pan fry on medium high until golden in a little oil or margarine (butter burns to quickly), serve with lemon wedges. make about twice as much as you think you will need or you'll run short."
