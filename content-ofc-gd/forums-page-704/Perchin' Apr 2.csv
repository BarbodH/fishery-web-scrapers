I decided to go into a little deeper water since the temp was up 10 degrees from last week and we hit the jackpot. In a few hours we got 150 perch with enough keepers for a couple massive feasts. It got to the point where we didn't have time to grab a drink or anything and triple and quadruple headers were a common occurrence.  We got quite a few in the 11-12 inch range that were FAT!!!                    Did I mention that it was hot out and I got a sunburn  Today I took the family down to the cottage and went on a boat ride from Long Point to Port Ryerse. It was a great relaxing ride. Next weekend I plan on doing it all over again
