They have this ""grandkid's pond"" there stocked with bluegill (and the odd non-stocked gator).  Here is a few pic's of the one day fishing for about 1 hour.  At one point my daughter turns to my wife and says ""here mom, let me use his rod so I can get a fish hooked as I catch a fish every cast""...  LOL!  Ya know what, she did too!    I swear she got a fish every cast.  We spent more time putting on worms and taking fish off then we did fishing!  With that said, here are the pic's and short videos.  You have to listen to my daughter in the one, LMAO!  Cheers.  Geoff  The start to the day:    First cast:    First fish:   Second fish:    More fish:         Daddy sneaks in a cast with my daughters rod (I left mine behind):    A few videos for you:    "

451928,GBW,2010-04-05 03:14:00,8460,"Thanks guys.  It sure was a good time fishing with them.  My daughter asked every day if we could fish, is was so fun.  I have a brand new rod and reel sitting there back in FL as I didn't get to use it as they were on the fish all day every day.  Cheers."
