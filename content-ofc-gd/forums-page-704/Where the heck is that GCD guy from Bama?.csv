451383,GoneFishin,2010-04-03 17:10:00,349,Didn't he say he was going to be gone for a couple weeks or something? Maybe I'm thinking of someone else?
451420,Whopper,2010-04-03 19:48:00,2174,  :lol:  He is alive and well kicking some crappie arse close to home
451423,Terry,2010-04-03 19:53:00,14456,if this was a hockey game  he is in the penalty box
451517,archie_james_c,2010-04-04 03:05:00,618,  Did GCD join the band?
451575,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-04 13:26:00,2038,Hey Dawg.......  Stefanie is looking for ya...
451609,douG,2010-04-04 15:13:00,2693,"Somebody pm me with Grant's info, or ask him to give me a call.  Thanks."
451630,highdrifter,2010-04-04 15:51:00,2534, Grant might be a little awol but doing just honky dory!!  I still get frantic girlish calls from him every time he takes an afternoon off..  I'll send ya his new digits.
451968,douG,2010-04-05 05:16:00,2693,"Thanks very large dere, Fidel.  I really enjoyed the few times Grant and I got out, and fish would have been a bonus.  I would guess.  The Dawg can be a little prickly, but a real likable character, and generous as hell.  One of my favourite afternoons was rowing Glen around the channels south of Lakair on the west arm of Lake Nipissing.  I was determined to put Glen onto his first pike, and I did it too."
451024,bassman,2010-04-02 19:32:00,384,What ever happened to our hillbilly friend from the south?  Anyone hear from him?
451051,gdelongchamp,2010-04-02 20:49:00,199,I have been wondering the same thing. Hasnt posted since mid Feb.
451055,Ziki,2010-04-02 21:15:00,128,  He probably got banned for constantly stirring the pot with his annoying posts.
451057,misfish,2010-04-02 21:22:00,29133," IYO.   Guess you have to be one ,thats ""not politcally correct"" to like Glenn."
451062,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-02 21:53:00,0,I think he's in the new intervention episode....
451081,skeeter,2010-04-02 23:18:00,1907,"Glen is sarcastic sometimes but thats his sense of humor. and if you ever met him you would probably like him. i met him at 1 of the OFC g2g and liked him right from the start. he will help anyone that needs help, thats the kind of guy he is.  ---------------------  -------------------------"
451119,Leecher,2010-04-03 00:35:00,7832,"He's one heck of a character, I'll give him that but most importantly, a very generous / good / kind person.... never met him and wish I could be closer so we could meet  I call him my friend     and I miss his presence on this site Leechman"
451143,TC1OZ,2010-04-03 01:01:00,987,I miss him making fun of me always wearing my Arkansas shirt in pictures lol...   Holler at us if you hear us!
451151,pike slayer,2010-04-03 01:07:00,1177,whooooo????
451156,Rich Clemens,2010-04-03 01:11:00,3131,"  I'll second that.  Met Glen a couple years ago at the summer GTG.  One heck of a nice guy and will quickly put a laugh on your face.  He was up at Lakair 2 years ago for a mini fall GTG in September. Patsy and I was at another camp nearby at the same time, so we took an afternoon off and drove up for a visit.  I dropped Glen a PM a few days ago to check up on him.   Haven't heard back yet.  Really hope everything's OK."
451162,archie_james_c,2010-04-03 01:21:00,618,Ya I've been missing that redneck around here. I used to think he was being sarcastic to piss people off. But that's just his sense of humour. Very funny guy  Hope nothing bad happened to him
451181,solopaddler,2010-04-03 01:48:00,8605,Yep hopefully he's okay.  While we're on the topic what the heck happened to Snag?  Hope Grant's okay as well.
451184,camillj,2010-04-03 01:51:00,1988,Hey Dog ... if you're watchin .. chime in .. got me concerned now too ...
451186,GBW,2010-04-03 01:56:00,8460,"Glen's busy with the spring fish I guess.  Grant on the other hand, well, I'll have to txt him when I'm home as I'm ready to get into some TO pike (WHEN WE CAN)."
451200,Sinker,2010-04-03 02:21:00,8692,The Dawg will chime in when he's ready. I'm sure he's fine  S.
451203,archie_james_c,2010-04-03 02:25:00,618,"  I heard he took a triple dose of Viagra and went on a ""binge"""
451209,Daplumma,2010-04-03 02:31:00,1961,"I'm sure he is fine.Lots of fish to be caught.Maybe a few in Alabama,prolly Crappie.Should be a forum for that or sumthin ,you would think.Would be nice to hear from him again here. Joe"
451241,bigfish1965,2010-04-03 03:25:00,3382,Glenn is on forum hiatus.
451242,Leecher,2010-04-03 03:31:00,7832, Really.... or is it M.... ah never mind    but how long does hiatus last??
451251,Sinker,2010-04-03 03:51:00,8692,  
451265,Ben_Daniels,2010-04-03 08:15:00,435,"I'm sure he'll chime in on this post soon enough, GCD is the man! He razzes you but its in good fun, definitely a good balance for the board...then again I did spend a chunk of my life in the south  -Ben"
451329,SlowPoke,2010-04-03 13:59:00,2984, Well said; one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I roll my eyes at some of his comments but always look forward to seeing him at the GTG's.
451356,OhioFisherman,2010-04-03 14:49:00,6623,"LMAO a southern boy, probably chasing his cousin? Glen is welcome here anytime! Might even cook him a possum so he feels at home!"
451366,skeeter,2010-04-03 15:20:00,1907,"i think we should PIN this post to the top , so glenn gets to read this when he signs back on.  who's with me on this? come on guys, throw your names up here !!!!!!!!!!"
451382,ehg,2010-04-03 16:53:00,2666,[quote name='solopaddler' date='02 April 2010 - 09:48 PM' timestamp='1270259287' post='451181' While we're on the topic what the heck happened to Snag?  Hope Grant's okay as well.  Was wondering about these two as well. Were both positive contributors to this community for many years.  No problem getting creative fishing reports and opinions from them in the past.
