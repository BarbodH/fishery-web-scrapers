451452,Handlebarz,2010-04-03 21:25:00,3790,Dang Tj that sure looks good now how many hours of turning the bird did that take and when we should show up?
451453,irishfield,2010-04-03 21:25:00,26272,No burning ban there... lol
451468,TJQ,2010-04-04 01:02:00,7806,LOL.. ya  a burning ban. whatever.. and ive got hot turkey sandwiches tomorrow.. my place noon.. ya get here .. ill feed ya1....
451469,TJQ,2010-04-04 01:04:00,7806,Oh ya...  takes 4-6 hours.. depend in on how cold the bird is when ya start and how hot the fire/wind is...  It a great way to force yourself to take a day off.

451479,irishfield,2010-04-04 01:38:00,26272,..Noon eh??
451482,maybo,2010-04-04 01:41:00,86,how can you make it keep turning around?
451490,TJQ,2010-04-04 01:53:00,7806," Witchcraft,,, and the proper twine...   "
451492,Ron,2010-04-04 01:54:00,1683,"Looks awesome as usual TJ.  I recall watching your video of this last year of the year before. You should post that again. It had great detail on how you did it.  Cheers, Ron..."

451513,TJQ,2010-04-04 02:50:00,7806,  Dammit...  
451538,pikehunter,2010-04-04 10:06:00,1659,Looks good! Probably a lot safer and healthier than deep frying a whole bird.
