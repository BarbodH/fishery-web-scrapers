Holy crap it's going to be a lot of work! haha  I thought I'd have it all slapped up in a couple days, looks like it's going to take me all week.  We're also replacing the front door and putting new vinyl around the door and above the window's but that'll have to wait a little while...        Thanks again for the birthday wishes!  Have a great long weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"
