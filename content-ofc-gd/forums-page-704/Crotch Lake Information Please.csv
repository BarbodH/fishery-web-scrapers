Interested in walleye, perch, bass and pike. Will be with son-in-law and two grandsons and will rent a boat from the Land O' Lakes Lodge where we are staying."

All I can say is it's a tough lake to fish, beautiful and scenic, but tough. My best luck was for smallies around the rocky reefs and points. The rare weedbed will hold some largemouth.  Enjoy your stay, it's a fun lake to fish, tons of promising looking structure. I just fond the bites are hard to come by, but still, we'll be back in August."
