451930,scuro2,2010-04-05 03:20:00,904,   Fished a new location yesterday and went into the local fishing store. Always like to give my patronage to those who offer advice. Picked up this williams spoon. Looks to be about 20-30 years old. Still had the old price tag of $6.95. Thought I might be able to use it for pike later in the year. Checked up on the lure on the internet and apparently it is used for lakers. Seems that some people don't even use this lure to fish with but use it as a flasher. One would take off the hook and then attach a much smaller lure with a leader to the back of this lure. Apparently this lure has a big wobble. Learn something everyday.
