Thanks to all of you that came out it was an awesome crowd and I had a blast! Everyone was great and it was fun talking to you all on and off the stage. Sorry I could not stick around too long after I would have loved to have a few cold drinks and catch the show from your stand up comic. Once again thanks. Dave Mercer"

Sorry we didn't get to chat much but you were quite busy with the good folks who wanted to bend your ear and I was kept busy with my duties selling beer tickets.  Imagine trusting me with the beer tickets....LOL  You did a stellar job and I'd like to thank you again for making it out, I know you had an incredibly busy weekend which I'm sure you're now glad is over.  I hope you're now well rested so you can get back to some Dave time out on the water.  Be well."
