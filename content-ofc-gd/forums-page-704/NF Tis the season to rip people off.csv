451443,Handlebarz,2010-04-03 21:07:00,3790,Well its that time of year again when the low life's come out to play I just came back in from my boat to find that my Charger was stolen. I guess we have been lucky over the years that the asses of the world have missed us but it started already I just thought I would post this for a reminder to all to have there stuff under lock and key.  Go figure I just put a new lock on the gate (it is hidden so that it does not give the idea to people I some good stuff here but to keep my dog from getting out of the yard) I hope they make good use of it as its a booster pack that is dead and just the charger works so it will look good on them when they are dead on the road.
