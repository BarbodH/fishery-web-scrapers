451615,jediangler,2010-04-04 15:24:00,1923,"Excellent link Joe. After searching through a few pages I even found my bike, a BMW R65. Of course mine is set up for touring and looks nothing like the custom job in the pic. I'll be passing the link on to my father who raced in the 50's and will be excited to see the Norton Manx and the street racing version of the Greeves, which was his last bike. We usually go to Paris, Ontario for the vintage bike show which is held on Father's Day just to see what bikes will show up."

451824,Daplumma,2010-04-05 00:59:00,1961,"Art (aplumma) and I have had quite a few bikes over the years.Yes Joey ,we love them Triumphs I had a couple of Tigers and Art had a Bonnie.All of them the wrong side shifters.Messed us up when we would get on the dirt bikes.Lately we have been busy with some vintage(read cheap)jap iron.We have a pristine 1978 kz650,a 1981 yamaha xj bobber we built,a 83 750 virago that is waiting for inspiration and a 77 kz 750 2 cylinder that we are making a cafe out of.That sight has some of the greatest works of garage home cooking that I have ever seen.Does my soul good to see that us gear heads/artists are not on an island here.
