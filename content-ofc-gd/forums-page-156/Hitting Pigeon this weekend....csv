936056,T-Bone,2015-09-23 16:33:00,160,"Haven't been up to Pigeon Lake since 1999, but me and a couple buddies are finally making our long-awaited return there this weekend for mostly relaxing, but of course some fishing too. Will be up a the north end out of Trails End Lodge.  Not asking for locations or anything like that, but what can we expect in terms of finding walleyes and bass (either smallies or large)? Any general insights like 'suspended', 'deep', 'hugging breaklines', etc. would be helpful. And, if we're using live bait, would minnows, crawlers, or leeches be the better bet? Not even sure if you can still get leeches this late in the year. Plan on hitting Mark's Worm Warehouse on the way in to get our licenses and bait.  We're going to try running some baits for muskies, but we're not holding our breath there...just hoping for lightning to strike in the form of a 'ski if we're lucky enough.  Weather forecast is looking awesome...early-autumn at its best. We simply can't wait to get there...  We're driving 8-hours each way for this and hopefully can pick-up some general tips so our time on the water gives us the best chance for some level of success.  Thanks in advance for the insights. "
936062,Gregoire,2015-09-23 17:24:00,1397,You've got a good chance at a ski if you're fishing for them with the super moon and the warm fall so far. Make sure you bring a big net and proper release tools.
936073,lew,2015-09-23 18:00:00,12766,Troll JailBird Believers over the deep water in the N/E corner of the lake and there's every possibility Mr. Musky will come pay you a visit.
936080,AKRISONER,2015-09-23 18:07:00,5558,"as a rule of thumb the bass fishing on pigeon/buckhorn has been fantastic for numbers this year but really tough on size. One of my best friends has fished buckhorn/pigeon close to 100 days this summer and hasnt caught a bass over 4 yet which is unheard of.  I spent a couple weekends on buckhorn/pigeon this year and we caught a whole pile LM , but not one over 3.5. Numbers were somewhere close to 100 over 2 days.  The walleye fishing this year specifically has been really good, lots and lots of eaters, we were catching them on crankbaits on shoals. they were even hitting plastics.  As far as musky goes, ill let you know! ill be most likely on pigeon this weekend for skis with pete!"
936083,Dara,2015-09-23 18:10:00,3052,I'm going to Gordon...never fished it before...not sure the program...you have fun on yours though
936087,T-Bone,2015-09-23 18:23:00,160,"I have two Believers in my box...and one of them just happens to be a jailbird. Thanks Lew, and thanks guys...appreciate it."
936091,lew,2015-09-23 18:29:00,12766,I have two Believers in my box...and one of them just happens to be a jailbird.  I get more muskies on Jailbird than any other colour.  When I'm trolling that's always the 1st one clipped on.
936136,esoxansteel,2015-09-23 20:59:00,1307,will be busy with musky anglers this weekend esp on Pigeon
936140,Gregoire,2015-09-23 21:18:00,1397,"I was out on Pigeon last weekend, and there were boats. but not what I would call busy. Definitely don't have the lake to yourself though."
936174,Sinker,2015-09-24 00:43:00,8692,"Lost a big one at the net tonight on pigeon. A real heart breaker! 45""+.....it was in the net for a second......I still want to throw up.  Magnum M&G spinnerbait. Gold blades, yellow bucktail trolled 4mph along a weededge on an inside corner.  Good luck!  S."
936204,scugpg,2015-09-24 10:23:00,1373,Good luck and say hi to Norm for me! That area you're staying is a good spot and also a bit further east at least for muskies. watch the rocks in the n/e end there are a few underwater islands that aren't well marked that go out a ways.
936215,lew,2015-09-24 11:49:00,12766,watch the rocks in the n/e end there are a few underwater islands that aren't well marked that go out a ways.  Those rocks also hold muskies and are definitely worth casting to.
936231,T-Bone,2015-09-24 13:52:00,160,Great info guys...thanks so much. I'll let you know how we do...
936245,ehg,2015-09-24 14:55:00,2666,Hopefully you have a depthfinder. There is great fishing in the area to the east of Trails End at this time of year. Find the area of 45-60 ft. deep water and use 3/8 to 1/2 ounce jig with slv/blk curly tail or paddle tail with worm and stinger hook (worm is important). The walleyes are deep along bottom there now.  This time of year in morning/ evening bass are all over topwaters. Casting topwaters or spinnerbaits along shorelines or at rocks works. 5 lb. bass are around.  Trolling that Jailbird Believer or perch Supershad Rap along 20-25 ft breakline to east of Hurricane point or throwing musky size spinnerbait at rocks in area gives good shot at decent musky.  This is best time of year for these depths outlined in that superb spot. Had a place there for 30 yrs. and did well at this time of year. Good Luck.
936260,jimmer,2015-09-24 15:55:00,2730,"I would say that you are better off targeting muskie at this time of the year. The bass seem to have a small window for the feed, first thing in the morning would be best for them, then switch over to the lunge. Don't underestimate a jig on the weed lines for muskie."
936423,fishindevil,2015-09-25 08:57:00,6254,Or just troll a double bladed worm harness with a big fat dew worm in it on a bottom bouncer & catch walleyes & a Muskie and if it's fire tiger color ya a Muskie for sure !!!    Lol
936445,davew3,2015-09-25 13:29:00,430,Take a trip to Gannons Narrows.  Fish the down side.  Jigs with twisters tipped with worms.  Use your fish finder to find the bottom breaks.  good luck
