936119,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 19:30:00,11391,Thats insane Lew!  Fish of one cast???
936121,lew,2015-09-23 19:32:00,12766,"Thats insane Lew!  Fish of one cast  Nope, just too much time on my hands LOL"
936122,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-23 19:34:00,10439,I had a large musky attack the prop on my first boat back in the early 80's. I had a 12' tinny and 5.5 Ob. As soon as I popped it into gear and started forward there was a thump. I saw a 30#+ ski come up and roll in the prop wash. Never had a pike do that.
936124,lew,2015-09-23 19:48:00,12766, I saw a 30#+ ski come up and roll in the prop wash.   I love trolling a bait  in the  prop wash right beside the motor. They come up and hammer it so close you can almost reach down a grab them without reeling in any line LOL
936125,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-23 19:59:00,8243,"Fantastic Lew, you da man. Maybe I should book a charter with you if I want to get another before my clock ticks to zero."
936128,lew,2015-09-23 20:12:00,12766,"I seldom fish any more Johnny, 3 weeks a year up on the West Arm of Nipissing is about all I do now."
936252,Rich Clemens,2015-09-24 15:22:00,3131,"I seldom fish any more Johnny, 3 weeks a year up on the West Arm of Nipissing is about all I do now.  I'll bet the Ontario musky populate is happy to hear that."
936255,lew,2015-09-24 15:32:00,12766,I guess you could call it semi retirement from fishing now Rich and I'll leave all those pretty girls for the new musky fishing generation
936297,Gallie,2015-09-24 18:37:00,1215,You have my gracious appreciation!
936379,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-25 00:31:00,956,Theirs no doubt in my mind that Lew has some primo spots on the Kawarthas for musky.  Why don't you be a good buddy and tell us where.
936034,Gallie,2015-09-23 15:09:00,1215,"The one thing i didnt understand about that episode was there was no mention of it possibly being a big pike, pike get to 50+"" and can be incredibly aggressive. They have the same basic shape of head and mouth full o teeth yet its just assumed a muskie bit someone? Lol I guess it doesnt make for good tv to have 2 possible suspects..."
936036,BillM,2015-09-23 15:18:00,17367,"The one thing i didnt understand about that episode was there was no mention of it possibly being a big pike, pike get to 50+"" and can be incredibly aggressive.

This is the same show that did an episode about 'killer sturgeon' up in Alaska, lol."
936055,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 16:32:00,11391,"Haha yeah wasnt that the ""its attacking our boat prop"" one?  Killer sturgeon lol"
936057,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 16:33:00,11391,Thats cool. But alot of fish that size come outta both lakes.  Just a preference I suppose.
936058,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 16:34:00,11391,And uncut angling is an awesome show btw
936067,BillM,2015-09-23 17:46:00,17367,"Haha yeah wasnt that the ""its attacking our boat prop"" one?  Killer sturgeon lol  Yup, pretty sure that was it!"
936070,Gallie,2015-09-23 17:52:00,1215,"Valid point bill, i guess i just cant help but try prop up poor old pike against the big bad musky lol"
936075,BillM,2015-09-23 18:01:00,17367,"Valid point bill, i guess i just cant help but try prop up poor old pike against the big bad musky lol  I love giant snakes, I'd rather catch them then muskies any day of the week!!!   He really has no idea what that fish could have been.  Most likely a pike to be honest."
936082,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:10:00,11391,"Bill, i too love fishing big pike.  I just started on musky this year and have yet to get anything decent.  Is there a big difference in the fight?  My pb pike is 47"" and i cant imagine any other freshwater fishing (aside from the great lakes) fighting like that fish did, other then sturgeon, which are insane 45 minute battles even for small ones lol"
936088,Gallie,2015-09-23 18:25:00,1215,"To this day the best fish fight ive had was my pb 44"" pike, this thing gave me everything! It jumped a few times, it took a couple twisting runs, she lifted just her head out of the water and shook violently and to top it all off when i got her close to the boat she went into a gator roll and the hooks popped out just as my buddy slid the cradle under her. That fish took about 2 1/2 min to get to the boat where as the big musky i just caught probably took half that. Mind you, the sheer power of the musky is something else, seemingly turning around on full drag and meandering its way to the boat on its schedule not mine lol. Imo both are strong aggressive predators with a few tricks up their sleeves so i give them both due respect, however i will reserve judgement on which is better until after i put a couple hundred musky under my belt to get a better sample size."
936090,Blue Lk,2015-09-23 18:28:00,337,"Rick,if you have any doubt about Eagle Lk's ability to produce world class muskie action check out North Shore Lodge's website. North Shore is 1 of the resorts in that episode of River Monsters"
936092,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:32:00,11391,Oh I dont doubt it one bit!  I used to visit the area often when I worked in ear falls.  All im saying is LOTWS is on par IMO.  I was in eagle lake when that tornado hit about 13 years ago
936093,lew,2015-09-23 18:34:00,12766,Imo both are strong aggressive predators with a few tricks up their sleeves  You have to watch those big ole pesky muskies cause they'll keep fighting you even when their in your boat and off the hooks  
936094,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:35:00,11391,"Hahaha Lew, great pic!"
936095,BillM,2015-09-23 18:35:00,17367,"Lew, he was trying to give you a kiss!"
936096,lew,2015-09-23 18:37:00,12766,"Lew, he was trying to give you a kiss!  I've been kissed by uglier Bill  LOL"
936097,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:45:00,11391,"But that pic scares me lol.  Bout 7 years ago I was fishing mainville with my pops and his friend.  We stopped for shore lunch and i went casted off this rock edge. Caught a 41"" pike(which is hyyyyu√πge for that lake).  For some reason I grabbed it with my left hand? I never do that, always my right hand.  I got the hook out and my dad came for a pic. She flopped insane and I dropped that fish on the rocks(my bad I know)  But on the way down her gill plate caught my thumb, right in the webbing.  By the amount of blood i though she almost severed my thumb clean off lol.  But it did cause nerve damage and I couldnt move my thumb for a few weeks, thankfully it healed properly and no issues now, just a scar"
936098,CRUD150,2015-09-23 18:46:00,87, I've been kissed by uglier Bill  LOL I doubt that musky said the same....  Cheers!
936099,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:47:00,11391,Zing!???
936100,lew,2015-09-23 18:49:00,12766,Zing!  Was it ever hahaha
936101,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 18:53:00,11391,  Just a kiss???
936105,lew,2015-09-23 18:55:00,12766,
936107,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-23 19:02:00,8243,"Lew do you know how many Musky you have boated over the years? It must be many and for sure more then my 3.  I'll take a Northern over a Musky any day. I know how to catch Pike. But seriously a 40"" Pike on light line is far more exiting than a 40"" Musky on a cable and a come along."
936110,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 19:12:00,11391,"Lol.  I do still use 20-30lb braid pike fishing  Anyhow I think it was on rainy lake I got a 40"" pike while crappie fishing.  4lb mono on a 5'6"" light rod  Didnt end well for the pike  That was a good 10-12 minute fight. Fish gassed out and couldnt revive.  In retrospect I wish I had just broke it off"
936117,lew,2015-09-23 19:24:00,12766,"Lew do you know how many Musky you have boated over the years? It must be many and for sure more then my 3.  Nope, no idea Johnny, I used to somewhat keep track for around 10 years and was averaging 80 -100 a year but that got to be like work so I stopped recording everything. Best year though was 115 in the boat and best day was 9 fish in 2 hours.  Been chasing after them toothy critters over 40 years though so yeah, I guess I have your 3 beat"
935695,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-22 01:21:00,10439,Jeremy is in Ontario on Eagle Lake. Looking for a serpent. Waiting for him to let us all know it's a MUSKY!!!!
935699,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-22 01:24:00,10439,HAHAHA!! There it is!!!!!!
935702,Gallie,2015-09-22 01:30:00,1215,"Yea im watchin it too, hope he gets a big one!"
935706,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-22 01:43:00,10439,HAHAHA!!! Baby pike beat down!!!! Nothing like a 2# pike driving the hooks into your arm!!!!
935710,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 01:53:00,11391,Always wondered why he choose eagle lake(it is a beauty lake)  Why not LOTWs??? Its only a few hours away and way better chance at a giant ski
935713,Gallie,2015-09-22 01:59:00,1215,"Good reminder that musky can frustrate anyone at times, funny he gets it on the light gear."
935714,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-22 02:02:00,10439,"Good reminder that musky can frustrate anyone at times, funny he gets it on the light gear.  I figured he was gonna poke an eye on that!!!"
935720,Gallie,2015-09-22 02:17:00,1215,Hahaha
935734,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 03:22:00,8243,On again at 12:00 AM eastern time on Discovery Channel.
935736,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 03:27:00,8243,"Rick it all comes down to production costs. From traveling schedule to a camera boat, all to do with budget."
935739,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 03:35:00,11391,"I suppose but its like a 3 hour drive away, dont see that being a huge budget buster to get way better quality fish.  Plus im sure he could stay for free at big grassy or big island and get the aboriginals involved.  The camps at eagle lake are beautiful but expensive"
935743,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 03:47:00,8243,"It's amazing what details go into a TV production, so I have been told by my sis-in-law. They do not have limitless funding. It could be as simple as not being able to get a quality guide at that particular week. I have seen many shows where the local FN folks were very involved. The shows coming on."
935752,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 04:31:00,8243,"These people can make 14"" Perch sound like a school of Piranha. That Musky skeletal head was very big. Approximating the fish to be 6' Lew big.  Lets see what he catches with that light spinning outfit?  Well I hung around to find out. A nice Esox on 6 pound test and a small jig tipped with a dead minnow. It can happen and it just did, lucky or what?  All in all I enjoyed it regarldess of the cliff hangers before going to commercial.  You will be happy to know Rick that the FN band was featured well in the production. Wade actually offered tobacco before heading out.  Huzzaba, guess what? Jeremy Wade snorkelled around an Island to look for fish. He fishes primarily from shore all across the globe."
935768,BillM,2015-09-22 11:37:00,17367,"Rick it all comes down to production costs. From traveling schedule to a camera boat, all to do with budget.  I don't think budget is the problem, have you seen the amount of time that guy spends in the middle of nowhere?  North Western Ontario should have been cheap in comparison.,"
935850,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 18:16:00,8243,"Well I don't know why, it usually comes down to money and or timing. Maybe someone up there bent over backwards to accommodate the shoot when someone else wouldn't."
935867,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 19:16:00,11391,Yep OI thats probably a big factor.  I know when my friend got gord pyzer to come do a fishing lecture in Emo ontario it costs 5 grand.  He probably went to red lake on a deal to advertise the fishery. And since its a pretty big/popular show he was either taken care of for free or was actually paid
935868,PikeMolester,2015-09-22 19:21:00,428,Always wondered why he choose eagle lake(it is a beauty lake)  Why not LOTWs??? Its only a few hours away and way better chance at a giant ski Not even close to the same chance at a giant ski. You will put up better numbers of fish on LOTW but Eagle has way bigger average fish.
935869,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 19:25:00,11391,Your opinion  I disagree
935873,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-22 19:49:00,956,"His guide said he had two 50"" muskies that followed his lure at the same time.  Oh man that would be awesome.  I'm sure my knees would buckle and over board I go haha."
935875,lew,2015-09-22 19:57:00,12766,"His guide said he had two 50"" muskies that followed his lure at the same time.  Oh man that would be awesome.  I'm sure my knees would buckle and over board I go haha.  I always chuckle at the number of folks who claim to have had  50""ers follow their bait but never seem to hook one."
935880,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 20:11:00,11391,I had four 50+ follow my umbrella rig!   ???? yeah right
935892,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-22 20:47:00,956,My first twenty pounder that followed I said was the size of a truck.  Trucks don't follow your lure up to the boat.
935964,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-23 01:51:00,470,"YES YES! And you jumped in the water with yer Home Depot tape measure and got a pretty accurate measurement of it too...... 50.4375""!!!! Or was it 50.375""........... ?!"
935966,manitoubass2,2015-09-23 02:13:00,11391,"The tape measure was cheap and rusted, wouldnt work!  50"" was a low ball though, and trust me I know, ive boated many muskies over 60""s  ????"
936030,AKRISONER,2015-09-23 14:50:00,5558,"Uncut Angling recently fished Eagle lake, with the local bait shop owner saying, we can fish Lake of the woods and catch a 50, or we can fish eagle and catch a 55+  sure enough they caught a 56."
