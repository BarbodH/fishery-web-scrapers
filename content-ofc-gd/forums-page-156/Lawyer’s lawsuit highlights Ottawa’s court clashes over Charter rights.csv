I guess Harper is hoping that he can stay in power long enough to nominate enough supreme court judges who will side with him on these issues. Hopefully that plan won't work out. This seems to go hand in hand with what the conservatives, and Harper specifically have tried to do to charter rights and freedoms, only support the ones they like. If I remember correctly a few years back the government of Canada ended a program to help individual Canadians who are fighting charter issues pay legal fees."

Great journalism Globe and Mail. In high school almost 50 years ago we were taught answer the 5 W's. Who, what, when, where and why?  Shawn Fine hasn't answered those questions well."

""... an issue that has received little notice thus far in the federal election campaign: the Conservative government’s frequent clashes with the courts over the Charter of Rights.  The Justice Minister is required under a 1985 law to tell Parliament if a proposed law is not “consistent” with the Charter. To Mr. Schmidt, a law is either consistent or it is not. But his superiors in the department didn’t agree.  “Oh, that’s not what we do,” he says he was told. “We ask ourselves whether there’s an argument.” And even if the argument has less than a five-per-cent chance of success in the courts, it can still be “credible” – in other words, consistent. ..."" Basically, he is supposed to say whether or not a law is constitutional or not. But the way the current government wants it enforced is even if you have a 5% chance of winning the argument that it is constitutional he is supposed to say that it is 'credible'."

936031,wkrp,2015-09-23 14:54:00,656,It is Harpers Charter . I remember before he got elected it was being said that he had a scary agenda in store for Canadians and it has come to pass. He is a  scary leader and will become a lot worse if re- elected. Canadians beware!
936064,Gregoire,2015-09-23 17:30:00,1397,"His total disregard the charter and the constitution is troubling. It is almost like he thinks a majority government has given him the authority to change the constitution, a shocking power grab for someone who has never had anywhere near the majority of Canadians vote for his party. He knows exactly what he is doing, forcing his political and ethical agenda onto Canadians through back door channels. Hopefully enough Canadians have realized what he is doing to remove him from power."

936172,John Bacon,2015-09-24 00:30:00,3277,How many vets in Canada ? Not one will vote for him.  My father is a vet and he will be voting Conservative.  I am sure he is not the only one.
936188,manitoubass2,2015-09-24 02:26:00,11391,Great to hear!!!!
936191,Woodsman,2015-09-24 02:44:00,1286,"I'm a vet & I'm sure not voting for Harper. Notice how I said ""Harper"". It's no longer the Conserative Party but Harpers Micro Managed Party. Make no mistake that Harper is currently calling all the shots and has been for years."
936250,KLINKER,2015-09-24 15:13:00,256,It never was the conservative party they just wanted the name to get the  conservative base that vote conservative no matter what. After Mulroony killed of the PC they weren't using it anymore anyway.
