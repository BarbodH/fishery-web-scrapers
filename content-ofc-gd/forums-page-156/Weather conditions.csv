935845,Cloudy15,2015-09-22 17:52:00,141,I am thinking about taking sometime off and heading up to the cottage to put some real work into figuring out these fall fish. So it looks like the next two weeks are in Hastings(trent river) are suppose to be very consistent with highs of 18-22 or so and lows between 10-13. Does this long stretch of consistent weather sound like prime time to go for certain species? Or perhaps I should wait for lower temps/ anything else.  Thanks
935980,fishindevil,2015-09-23 08:13:00,6254,The fall feedbag is ramping up for many species and it's a stretch of stable weather it's never a bad time to go fishing anyways !!! Lol ... Just go and figure them out at least now in the area you mentioned the boat traffic will be less and less as fall rolls on  just fish for different species at different times of day to increase your odds !!!
