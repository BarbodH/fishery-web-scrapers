922635,BassMan11,2015-07-01 01:49:00,583,Tank of Seafoam is going through it now. I will get it fixed for free one way or another. I am glad it is narrowed down to something not major. Thanks to everyone who has given advise thus far. It is much appreciated.
922638,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-01 01:53:00,10439,It is still possible you have a crappy fuel line. The layers tend to separate and the lines collapse on the inside due to ethanol degradation.
923086,Mike the Pike,2015-07-03 20:28:00,3421,Had a 2000 Honda 50 HP 8 yrs old  not one problem .....had a 26 yr old Honda 7.5 hp always started first crank and use a little 2 hp Honda as my kicker motor ....bottom line they are reliable and cheap on fuel
923436,Gerritt,2015-07-06 03:15:00,6129,Bingo
923476,Fisherman,2015-07-06 15:33:00,7201,Already done on the 23rd of June and posted.
923494,BassMan11,2015-07-06 18:07:00,583,Got a call from my buddy the mechanic today. He pulled the carbs again and cleaned them thoroughly and made sure the jets were clear. Told me that lots of fuel is getting to the carbs so it doesn't look like a fuel line issue to that point. If it still didn't run right he talked about possibly drilling out the jets a size bigger?... I guess that is something he had to do before on a Honda 25 he was working on that was having a similar issue. Going to take her for a rip tonight to see if the problem is still there.  Fingers crossed.
923500,BillM,2015-07-06 18:36:00,17367,Ehh.... how much of a mechanic is your buddy?   Boring out jets is not something you do (or should ever be a requirement)
923506,Fisherman,2015-07-06 19:31:00,7201,"I would rather  try a factory larger set of jets than have someone start reaming out holes and trashing a good set.  In 17 years of running mine, never ever had a fuel problem, other guy with the same SS 30HP is about 14 years and no problems without carb tinkering."
923518,BassMan11,2015-07-06 20:17:00,583,Well he is pretty reputable. He has worked at a major boat repair shop here in Ottawa for probably 10 years and he has done work to my old 1978 9.9 seahorse and had her running like a top so I do trust him. I think he would be trying to save me money.  All this talk about how great Honda's are just makes me more frustrated. lol. The thing should be bullet proof.
923576,bigbuck,2015-07-06 23:38:00,2449,"You should not need to mess with jets. Now that the carbs were cleaned out nicely, run some more Seafoam through it. Do not rule out the fuel lines unless they were checked out properly. Do a search on iboats.com in the forums. There is a honda section. Onebof the gurus there may be able to steer you in the right direction. Once your carbs get drilled out, there is no going back."
923579,BillM,2015-07-06 23:41:00,17367,"Swapping all the fuel line can't be that expensive, I'd rule that out before doing anything else."
923620,Sinker,2015-07-07 03:08:00,8692,"Yep, id toss the old fuel line, and giver a good dose of seafoam. Have you seafoamed it yet??  The carb might be getting fuel, just not enough. Seafoam will clean everything from the tank, right thru to the exaust.  S."
923641,BassMan11,2015-07-07 11:50:00,583,"Hey Guys,  First off I am on my second good douse of seafoam in my tank and it hasn't made a lick of difference. He had also checked the fuel lines and delivery and it seems to be fine.  I had to work late last night so I didn't get a chance to run the boat but my mechanic buddy did and I think the problem is fixed. He had the carbs apart this weekend and said they looked immaculate so he decided to drill out the jets. Now..... he knows that isn't the ""proper"" thing to do but he has actually had to do this on 4 other Honda motors in the last 10 years when nothing else short of ordering new carbs would work. He literately took a drill bit that he could thread through the jet hole and bored it out a tiny tiny bit.  The boat now jumps up on plane immediately and is hitting 24mph at 3/4 throttle while wide open hits the rev limiter (prop to small now I assume).  It looks like my troubles might just be coming to an end with this motor. I will need to get myself and the wife in the boat to get the true performance and speed. Regardless it's a step in the right direction."
923642,BillM,2015-07-07 11:57:00,17367,I wonder if there was build up on the jets themselves?  I can't see Honda installing the wrong jets from the factory (Although weirder things have happened I'm sure)
923661,Sinker,2015-07-07 13:11:00,8692,Just be careful now that you don't over rev the engine and fry it!  Good news though!  S.
923697,MrSimon,2015-07-07 16:37:00,217,"Sounds like he didn't actually make the jets bigger .... basically he just cleaned them out with brute force.  If bad gas sits in the carbs for a long time, it becomes almost impossible to clean everything with just solvents and thin wire.  I'd definitely put new fuel hoses/filters on for good measure.  All it takes is one small piece of gunk from the inside of the hose to break loose and lodge in the jets."
923794,Mister G,2015-07-08 00:28:00,1429,Sorry to hear you made a big mistake by buying this Honda outboard. Seen many at the docks over the years and I can tell you they are not normal outboards that most of us grew up with.........  These foreign built outboards are so damn quite that you will not even know they are running while you will continue to try to start them. Either you will be pulling your shoulder out of place or wearing out the damn battery and or starter trying to get these damn thing running while they are running.  BTW I'm a E-Tech guy through and  through ! ! ! ! !
923814,2 tone z71,2015-07-08 02:21:00,1311,That Honda will be running for many yrs ..long after your beloved E Tecs in a box under a workbench somewhere
923817,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-08 02:25:00,10439,"Good to hear you got it sorted out. Now, you need a prop with more pitch to finish things off!!"
923983,BassMan11,2015-07-09 01:33:00,583,Got the boat out for an hour tonight. The wife and I in the boat. That's how Honda's are supposed to run.  
923986,Fisherman,2015-07-09 02:08:00,7201,"One hint that worked for me, a shot of Seafoam in every tankful, at the end of the season, drain the carbs dry, change the fuel filter.  Princess Auto has small ones that will fit in place of the outrageously overpriced OEM ones for about $5.  And drain the tank hose too, put a small nail in the output end and push down on the ball bearing at the other end."
935379,evster,2015-09-20 13:21:00,367,"How has it been running?  I have pretty much the same motor in 25 hp and feel the same way.  It will plane up with just me, gas, tackle and a couple batteries, but when I add another person or my wife and daughter it doesn't plane.  Add a 3rd person or some more gear and it plows.  I figure the boat with all gear is about 1000 lbs or so.  I am considering buying a different boat and motor but maybe I should look into this a bit more.  Maybe its a fuel problem as well.  When you played with the choke while running what exactly did you do?  Did you just pull the choke out and it sped up?"
935404,BassMan11,2015-09-20 16:43:00,583,Hey Evster  Motor has been running fine all year since the jets were drilled out. About 1000lbs in my boat as well and I will be running at 25mph with a 12 pitch prop. When I was fooling  around with the choke I just opened the throttle all the way and slowly pulled the choke out until the motor started to run better.  Now after saying all this mine was really bogged down. Very low rpms when there was problem. What max hp is your boat rated for?
935484,evster,2015-09-20 23:24:00,367,"Boats rated for a 30 hp.  I have a 9 pitch prop on there now, maybe I should try something else.  I also need to fiddle with the pin and try it set at different spots.  Its the only motor I've had, but it seems like its running ok based on sound, etc.  Maybe its all I'm going to be able to get out of this boat."
921221,BillM,2015-06-23 14:36:00,17367,Compression should be the same no matter how the engine is started (pull or electric).  Should be around 200..   What you want to make sure of is that all cyls are within 10% of each other.
921253,BassMan11,2015-06-23 15:58:00,583,OK i'll check that tonight. Hopefully it will be up around those numbers. What numbers does the compression start to be a concern? 150-100?  Thanks for everyone's help so far. I hopefully didn't buy a lemon.
921258,porkpie,2015-06-23 16:07:00,2521,"If it's running at 100 psi, it won't matter how close the cylinders are compression wise, you probably have issues.  Keep in mind I'm quoting numbers for a 50HP, but I imagine the 30 would be similarily high.  Remember to advance your throttle when doing the test.  Good luck."
921293,BassMan11,2015-06-23 18:49:00,583,"If it's running at 100 psi, it won't matter how close the cylinders are compression wise, you probably have issues. Keep in mind I'm quoting numbers for a 50HP, but I imagine the 30 would be similarily high. Remember to advance your throttle when doing the test. Good luck. So open the throttle in neutral when testing?"
921294,porkpie,2015-06-23 19:02:00,2521,"Yes, I think the factory spec calculates it at 500 rpm.  Most ATV's need to be tested with the throttle open as well.  If you run it until warm on the muffs before the test, you''re likely get your best readings.  I'm sure it will turn out ok, but it just rules out one more thing.  Good luck."
921340,BassMan11,2015-06-23 21:41:00,583,Didn't have the room to pull out the boat and throw the muffs on. But I did a compression test on all three cylinders. Top - 136 Middle - 133 Bottom - 135  Are these numbers ok from a cold start? Can I rule out compression being an issue?
921352,Fisherpete,2015-06-23 22:27:00,1814,"Just for comparison my 16' Legend with 30 Honda gets 27.5mph when I am solo, 24.5 with a 200lb passenger. Boat weighs around 1000lbs with motor batteries etc. included."
921356,BassMan11,2015-06-23 22:41:00,583,Thanks Pete. That's what I figured. My boat is 1000 with 2 people included. I was looking to get  close to 30 so when I was struggling to get 15-17 by myself I knew something was up.
921361,porkpie,2015-06-23 23:13:00,2521,"I really am not sure with the 30, so I am talking out my proverbial behind here.  When I bought my 50, compression from a cold (it was minus 8 out at the time) was around 175 across all cylinders.  Factory spec called for 199psi.  I was satisfied because the engine was cold, and it was a 1999.  It runs great and carries a 16 foot boat with full interior and console, 2 guys at 230lbs a piece, 3 batteries and full of gas and gear at 30mph in perfect conditions with a tail wind.   I likely wouldn't have bought the boat with 135 on all cylinders.  BUT, it's not a 30hp.  I suggest you call a honda dealer, explain the situation and see if they will give you the factory compression for your motor.  They should be able to help you out with year also.  Hopefully your compression is good for the year/motor.  Good luck with it."
921409,BillM,2015-06-24 11:09:00,17367,Those compression numbers are fine according to a few Google searches I've come up with.
921417,BassMan11,2015-06-24 12:43:00,583,Those compression numbers are fine according to a few Google searches I've come up with. I agree Bill..... reading just about everything I can on the interweb the general consensus is they are pretty good. Plus I talked to my mechanic buddy yesterday and there is a feature on the pull start Honda outboards that lower the compression when starting so it is easier to pull so that's why I don't see anything near 200. It's called auto decompression I believe.  Going to dump a bunch of seafoam in the tank and give it a good run this weekend. Next week I will start looking at flushing all the fuel lines and possibly change the fuel pump. I think we have narrowed it down to either a fuel issue or an air intake issue.
921418,Sinker,2015-06-24 13:09:00,8692,"It would help if you knew what RPM's you were running.  A buddy at work had a similar issue with a 25 merc 4 stroke. Boat wouldn't plane, and lack of power. Turned out it was his prop.....over propped.  Try the seaafoam though, and I would try it with a new fuel line as well. I had one do something similar on mine, and it was the fuel line. It was eaten up by the ethanol in the fuel. The line looked fine, and seemed to work fine, but after replacing it and having a look at the inside, it was all gunked up with crud and hardly any fuel was getting by.  S."
921419,porkpie,2015-06-24 13:13:00,2521,If the engine has a decompression feature that would account for those numbers.  Most quads with a rope starter have a decompression lever or you'd tear your arm out of the socket trying to turn one over.
921423,BassMan11,2015-06-24 13:31:00,583,"It would help if you knew what RPM's you were running.  A buddy at work had a similar issue with a 25 merc 4 stroke. Boat wouldn't plane, and lack of power.

Hopefully it is as easy and changing the fuel line(s)."
921509,Wagoneer,2015-06-24 19:12:00,118,"Sounds like a fuel issue. I'm guessing the connector at the motor is sucking air. When you squeeze the primer do you notice any hissing from the engine? Or any air escaping at all? I had a similar problems with my Suzuki 2-stroke outboard. Idle was fine, but anything above half throttle it would bog really badly. Turned out the fuel connector (brand new) was sucking air and not fuel under any sort of load. I swapped it out with a much simpler (and this will be the only time I'll admit to using merc parts) Mercury connector at the engine as well as at the tank and it seals up perfectly now. Even though the Suzuki connectors never leaked fuel when disconnecting/connecting but the mercury ones spill fuel all over the place when you disconnect them, at least the Mercury connectors seal properly under suction.  Doesn't really matter what prop you're using, that motor should get you on plane no problem on a 14' boat."
921601,BassMan11,2015-06-25 11:20:00,583,Next week I will be troubleshooting fuel components. Thanks again for everyone's help. I will keep you posted.
922311,BassMan11,2015-06-29 14:10:00,583,"Hey Guys,  Got out on the water this weekend and played around with the motor. After reading a few reports I saw someone say if you played around with the choke it might do something. I did that and immediatley the boat launched up to 20mph. Is this a carb / jet issue? At least I was up on plane with two people!"
922319,BillM,2015-06-29 14:47:00,17367,"Yup, something is clogged.    My guess is old fuel was left in it..   Simple fix as well."
922331,Fisherman,2015-06-29 16:15:00,7201,"If you're pulling out the choke and it's running faster, then you definitely have carb issues, the jets need a thorough cleaning.  I just did a lawnmower for a lady a couple doors down,  run for 2-3 seconds and quit, over and over.  Pulled off the bowl and it was full of little gummed up gas balls.  Took out the main jet, ran a very thin piece of copper wire through it and pushed out more jello gas.  A little more cleaning, put it back together and it runs like new.  She even said she used stabilizer regularly.  I showed her the can of Seafoam for future use."
922339,BassMan11,2015-06-29 17:00:00,583,Thanks guys. I'll get my mechanic to look at it. I took it to a marina to have the carbs cleaned but I guess they weren't cleaned good enough? Paid a pretty penny for it as well. Makes me a little upset but at least the problem is diagnosed now and I can just get it fixed properly.
922340,BillM,2015-06-29 17:07:00,17367,"I'd go back and get them to do the job properly.  I wouldn't pay for it again either, that's Bull."
922350,Beavertail,2015-06-29 17:46:00,331,"Don't let them off the hook so easy, I would definitely go back and talk to them about it. I have limited experience dealing with marinas but so far they all have been serious let downs."
922351,MrSimon,2015-06-29 18:01:00,217,"I agree.  Don't let it go.  Cleaning carbs isn't all that hard, but it's one of those jobs that people often don't do properly .... especially the jokers some marinas hire to work in the shop.  If at all possible, take the boat out on the water and show them what's happening, then after the fix it, take them back out to make sure it's fixed.  Also, I believe the carbs on that motor need to be synchronized ... which should have been included in the work they already did."
922444,Sinker,2015-06-30 01:53:00,8692,Have you given it a good dose of seafoam yet? I bet that will clear a lot of it out.  S.
922453,ecmilley,2015-06-30 02:58:00,2163,3 carbs with all the same problem is unlikely pulling choke still makes most of fuel come through main jets. Be looking at fuel lines/connectors /pick up first then check fuel pump diaphragm

Fully loaded with 2 people the boat weighs 1000lbs and I am only getting about 15mph at full throttle. This can't be right can it? I have already brought it in to get a full tune up and all 3 carbs cleaned. Also I have changed the prop from a 10 pitch to a 9 pitch to see if this would increase the RPM's but it still sounds bogged down.  Anyone have any idea's of what else I should be looking at?  Any information or advice would be much appreciated.  Thank you."

921031,glen,2015-06-22 14:05:00,2641,Tune up or down.   Check carb linkage at all three carbs to make sure they are opening all the way.  Or maybe it's only running on two
921032,Sinker,2015-06-22 14:07:00,8692,Does it have  power trim?  Where is the pin set for the trim? Maybe bring it up a notch and try again.....  S.
921033,Fisherman,2015-06-22 14:09:00,7201,My 25 Honda was on a 16' Princecraft and with 2 people I could get 37-38kmh or about 25MPH.
921041,BassMan11,2015-06-22 14:39:00,583,"It is a manual trim and I have tried all of them and it doesn't make a difference.  The Boat is a 14' Sylvan and I would think at least 25mph would be my target speed.  Glen, The carbs are opening all the way but I would agree that it does sound like shes not firing on all cylinders but I thought maybe that is how a 4 stroke sounds (my first one)?. Either that or a fuel delivery issue would be my guess."
921042,MrSimon,2015-06-22 14:45:00,217,"Are you saying that you already had it professionally tuned up and had the carbs cleaned?  If so, then I'd assume it's running properly on all three cylinders and your problem is most likely motor positioning ...mounting location or trim settings - as was already mentioned.  Any chance you have a long shaft motor on a short transom ... it kind of looks like that could be the case from the photos."

The mechanic is actually a friend of mine that works at a place here in Ottawa. He has looked at it again and thought it was a prop issue (which I replaced) but it didn't fix it. The motor is defiantly a short shaft and I have the cav plate at the proper location after doing some research."

Like someone else mentioned you may be only running on 2 cylinders.  Friend of mine has a Princecraft 14.5 Fisherman similar to yours with a 30 Honda, that thing goes trans warp. Just for chits & giggles,  while you're tied up at the dock and in neutral running, pull each one of the spark plug wires off one at a time and see if you notice any difference."
921137,BassMan11,2015-06-22 23:57:00,583,Pulled each plug and the motor would run rougher. Not a carb issue. It must be fuel. Is your fuel filter supposed to be full of fuel at idle? Mine looks almost empty until I squeeze the pump on the hose.
921144,Fisherman,2015-06-23 00:20:00,7201,"No it doesn't have to be full, mine never was at any time, it sort of lay there at a 45 degree and always had a small air pocket.  I don't suppose you have the specs to check the timing?  There's marks on the flywheel and cam that have to line up,"

921148,BassMan11,2015-06-23 00:30:00,583,That is something my mechanic said he would check. It looks like a new belt so maybe the timing is off? Wouldn't the motor idle rough though if the timing was off?
921152,ecmilley,2015-06-23 00:37:00,2163,"yes if the timing belt was off a tooth it would idle rough, if compression was good timing is most likey good, belt out will give a low steady compression reading usually and a low and steady vacuum ready while running"
921194,MrSimon,2015-06-23 13:05:00,217,Make sure your mechanic takes it for a water test.  Sometimes it's hard to diagnose a cylinder not firing in the shop.  I had an issue with the same motor where the fuel connector at the motor was letting some air in ... causing it to stall out sometimes.  I'd double check all your connections.
921205,BassMan11,2015-06-23 13:41:00,583,Going to do a compression test tonight to rule out that problem (hopefully). Any guess on what the readings should be? If the compression checks out then it must be a fuel delivery issue. Agreed you can't really fully test the motor unless it is ran out on the lake. You can only do so much in a tank at a shop.
921218,porkpie,2015-06-23 14:30:00,2521,"My 50hp calls for almost  200psi factory new, but it is electric start, I believe the electric start honda 30 would be somewhere close to 200 as well.  Don't know about a manual start, might call a honda dealer, or try iboats."
880536,BassMan11,2014-11-13 13:20:00,583,"Just about to pull the trigger of buying this motor for my ""Big"" 14' aluminum (rated for a 35). Anyone have experience with this motor or Honda 4 strokes in general? I heard they are great motors if taken care of properly.  thanks guys,  BassMan"
880538,BillM,2014-11-13 13:35:00,17367,"We had a 2000 40hp 4 stroke Honda on the back of our 15ft Legend, one of the best motors we've ever had.  Absolutely zero issues, never left us stranded, it also sipped fuel.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy one."
880539,MrSimon,2014-11-13 13:42:00,217,I had a 30HP Honda fourstroke and now have a 40HP Honda fourstroke ... both from the late 90's.  Both are excellent motors!!!  They run smooth and quiet.  It's easy to change the oil.  They do need a good five minutes to warm up on cold mornings.  Here is a video of my 30HP before I sold it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIffFz_s1E4
880540,LucG,2014-11-13 13:44:00,779,"Hey BassMan,  I have a 2007 Honda 30 HP 4 Stroke BF. I have had absolutely zero issues with it thus far. *knock on wood*  I run it on a 16' Lund and get about 25 mph. Mind you have have it fully loaded most of the time.  It has never let me down. Very little maintenance. To store it I simply run some stabil through it on my last trip out, and drain the gear oil just in case water has entered, which it never has. Then replace the motor oil in the spring. This year I changed the fuel filter for the first time, and it was barely dirty. Always starts up perfect in the spring. Like others have mentioned, its amazing on fuel!!!!  If the motor is in great shape and the price is right, I'd say go for it!  Oh and it runs very quiet too!  Goodluck"

Goodluck It is priced well compared to other 25-30 hp motors I have been looking at that is for sure. It always makes you wonder why it is so ""cheap"". The guy said it just had $350  worth of work done to it and will run it for me when I head out there. I would assume I would be running around 30mph in my boat. Sounds like I am making the right choice here.  thanks guys."
880559,LucG,2014-11-13 15:11:00,779,"I would find out what kind of ""work"" he had done. Regular maintenance? Or was it more serious?"
880566,BassMan11,2014-11-13 15:48:00,583,"Regular maintenance.  New engine oil, gear oil, spark plugs, fuel filter, carb clean etc..... Sounds like a regular tune up from a shop."
880569,irishfield,2014-11-13 15:59:00,26272,Electric or pull start? Hoping electric or you'd better learn the exact spot of throttle to start it.  We have a 2000 x 25 HP on our steel boat at the lake. Runs flawless and it had been stored improperly (basically just pulled up on shore) for over 3 years before we bought the camp that it came with. 3 carbs and have never had an issue with it period. I've changed the plugs once in 10 years and probably didn't need to.

880573,irishfield,2014-11-13 16:20:00,26272,"Hopefully the handle is still marked with the throttle location for starting. I borrowed a 30 x 4 stroke Johnson from the marina a few years ago, late in the fall... and the handle markings were worn clean. Damn near had a coronary trying to pull starting it the next cold morning... and when I finally did and took it back, the owner said ""did you turn it to here""?"

880579,BillM,2014-11-13 16:44:00,17367,I never noticed a mark for starting on our 40hp.
880581,irishfield,2014-11-13 16:45:00,26272,Ok... maybe it was just the Johnson..
880582,BassMan11,2014-11-13 16:50:00,583,Ok... maybe it was just the Johnson.. I know my 9.9 1978 Seahorse had to be on that start mark on the handle that is for sure.
880585,MrSimon,2014-11-13 17:18:00,217,"When my 40 Honda is cold, it certainly starts better if I have the throttle right at the ""choke/start"" line .... although better is relative, this things always starts easily."
880641,Fisherman,2014-11-13 22:51:00,7201,Probably 1/8th of a turn from idle.
880643,Terry,2014-11-13 22:54:00,14456,even my 5hp honda has a sweet spot for starting
880799,jimmer,2014-11-14 18:47:00,2730,"This might be insignificant, but is the motor a short or long shaft and is it compatible to your transom. I have a 14' wide body with a walk through floor, but a short transom. I don't think I would put a 30hp 4 stroke on it due to the weight of the motor. I have a 25hp 2 stroke and the water level can get scary when rough, any added weight would make it dangerous."
880839,Fisherman,2014-11-15 00:28:00,7201,"I don't believe he'll have any weight issues at all, 12footsprigbok has a Lund 14 and inherited my '96 Honda 25 L/S, no problems.  I don't think the 30 is that much heavier."

880847,BassMan11,2014-11-15 01:02:00,583,"its a 30 short shaft and I understand the concern. Again the boat is rated for a 35 but I also plan to counter balance the weight with some more weight in the front (i.e. battery, gas tank). I also rarely head out alone so again that is more weight in the front of the boat. I am curious on the weight of the motor though… any guesses?"

Might want to get a handle extension, Minn Kota  extensions work great. Much nicer for standing and cruising.  Edit- this motor was electric start. Sweet spot was on the choke start spot lol no issues with starting. Can't comment on hand bombing it  TDunn"
