935490,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-20 23:52:00,956,Just wondering how would I obtain a license plate for my boat and trailer if I buy a used one on kijiji?  Do I need ownership papers to give to Service Ontario and what happens if they don't have any papers to give to me.  Thanks
935494,Paudash,2015-09-21 00:10:00,273,"Go before you buy, go to and say you want to register a home made trail, pay $35.00 I think then you can walk out with plates and go pick up your boat"
935495,huzzsaba,2015-09-21 00:28:00,884,"I had a similar question. I think it depends on the size of the boat and size the motor.  Suppose I get a 12 foot aluminium boat with a 9.9 motor without a trailer, do I need to register and/or get it licensed?  I think in this case the only thing that needs to be registered is if there is a trailer??"
935496,HTHM,2015-09-21 00:51:00,4082,"Every trailer if plated , will have an ownership associated with the plate. If the seller wants to retain his plate, then you take the vehicle portion to Serviceontario and get the trailer transferred into your name. http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/vehicle/used.shtml"
935669,Joeytier,2015-09-21 22:54:00,3990,This plus any boat with less than 10hp outboard does not need to be registered . You only need to worry about your trailer being registered
