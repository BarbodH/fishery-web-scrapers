934407,Pigeontroller,2015-09-15 01:41:00,2793,"Totally agree haha. Probably going to get the Frabill Big Kahuna.  For your boat I'd recommend the Frabill Big Game, a bit smaller and not as deep than the Kahuna, better for lower boats! The Kahuna would also be a beast to wield solo...Thats where the Beckman was nice, it was the lightest Muskie net on the market...Sadly no longer available..."
934427,PBenson,2015-09-15 03:57:00,154,Makes sense. Thanks for the info!
936289,PBenson,2015-09-24 18:13:00,154,"If anyone wants to learn more about jigging for muskies check out this months edition of Musky Hunter Magazine, which features an article from John Bondy, the maker of the baits I use in this video."
933056,PBenson,2015-09-07 20:21:00,154,"I filmed some of the Muskie jigging I did over this past summer, check it out & tight lines!  "
933078,grimsbylander,2015-09-07 22:27:00,3016,Great video thanks for sharing it
933080,davey buoy,2015-09-07 22:35:00,5505,"Very nice,that would be a blast with that sudden hit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
933083,dave524,2015-09-07 22:44:00,4508,"Nice , great video, I'd consider a shorter rod for jigging, especially if you are fishing alone, netting the first 2 looked awkward."
933102,mistaredone,2015-09-08 00:46:00,913,Cool vid!  always wondered if that worked in the summer
933108,Gallie,2015-09-08 01:16:00,1215,Nice job man!
933112,Moosebunk,2015-09-08 01:36:00,3970,Jiggin' skies is something I usually have to wait ti'll November for... Living on the Detroit and doing it all year round would be a blast.  Nice little vid dood!  Get's me itching to maybe road trip that way next month.
933142,PBenson,2015-09-08 12:37:00,154,Thanks guys
933144,chris.brock,2015-09-08 12:44:00,4053,"Great video, I enjoyed it!"
933145,solopaddler,2015-09-08 12:50:00,8605,Now THAT was super cool!
933282,emjay88,2015-09-09 05:25:00,70,Great watch!!!
933431,misfish,2015-09-09 22:38:00,29133,"You have detroit river jigging, we have simcoe jigging, but no Musky.LOL  That would be a blast. Very cool."
933445,Rizzo,2015-09-09 23:53:00,4754,Give Simcoe a couple more years Brian! Great video. The river is never calm like that when I am there. That actually looked quite pleasant.
933495,singingdog,2015-09-10 10:45:00,1047,Nice vid! I have had a couple of skis jigging small bulldawgs along deep weedlines. I wondered if anyone else was doing it in warm water.
933675,mike rousseau,2015-09-11 04:59:00,4661,I know I keep saying it but man I gotta try jigging here on the st lawrence...
933687,PBenson,2015-09-11 12:16:00,154,"You guys have some giants up there, it would be epic to get one of them jigging haha"
933692,Brettiop,2015-09-11 13:12:00,279,Thats a sweet video man!
934163,Joeytier,2015-09-13 22:29:00,3990,Awesome.  I can see how that would be addicting...
934171,musky666,2015-09-13 23:04:00,126,Very nice! I actually purchased a 6' handle for my Beckman for when I fished alone- only way to reach the fish with long rods (RIP Beckman ...)
934176,PBenson,2015-09-13 23:56:00,154,"Might have to do something like that. As you can see in the video my musky net is a POS, I need to get a new one anyway."
934213,ccmtcanada,2015-09-14 02:10:00,7971,Great job on the video and great fish too!!
934226,Pigeontroller,2015-09-14 02:55:00,2793,"Might have to do something like that. As you can see in the video my musky net is a POS, I need to get a new one anyway.  Yup, if you can afford the rod, reel, Iphone and fancy Go Pro...No excuse for for not having a quality net.  Cool video though."
934252,PBenson,2015-09-14 11:52:00,154,Totally agree haha. Probably going to get the Frabill Big Kahuna.
934257,mikeh,2015-09-14 12:44:00,824,"Nice video, never knew you could jig for them in deep rivers or chanels"
934336,lunkerbasshunter,2015-09-14 20:44:00,2585,great video!  Thanks for sharing it
