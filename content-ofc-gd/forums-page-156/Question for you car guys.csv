936132,netminder,2015-09-23 20:36:00,514,"Well I just got the owner's manual out and located the filter and removed it in under 1 minute. I'm going to get a filter and keep it in the house so I have a new filter to throw in the car whenever it goes to the dealership or whenever the one in there starts to stink.  I just hate the games the dealership plays. Buy a new car from them and they offer 5 years of free oil changes. GREAT. Then every time you take it in for your FREE oil change they are ALWAYS pointing out things while they are doing the oil change.  When I phone to book my appointment I specifically ask is there any other service pending. If they say ""yes"" I get it done. If they say ""no"" I expect to only have the oil changed and not have them poking around the car looking for something else to charge me for. Service is where most dealerships make most of their money. A lot of times they get very little markup on the cars they sell, unless they're used. They're relying on the fact that you'll come in to the dealership for all that work. Not saying it's right or wrong, but that's generally how it is.  As for the OP, It's basically the same concept as the air filter on your furnace. Just keeps the air clean in your car. Mike Holmes would probably cry a single tear of pride if you changed it."

936268,Mister G,2015-09-24 16:26:00,1429,Is $90 for a cabin filter a money grab.......NO it's highway robbery ! ! !  When they can be purchased from RockAuto.com for $7.43 for that particular vehicle. Purchase 3 at a time as the shipping is the same.  How long do cabin filters need to be changed. That is a variable question/answer because it all depends on your local environmental surroundings that said vehicle encounters.  Dusty roads or parking under a tree makes a huge difference then driving on clean highways and parking in a garage when not in use.  Most are located behind the glove box which takes 2 minutes to remove and replace. I recommend replacing the cabin filter once a year or sooner if you smell a musty odor when you turn on the A/C or heater. And at $7.43 each you have no excuse not to.

936353,John,2015-09-24 21:41:00,2956,"Firstly, as far as maintenance, even under warranty, you have the right to maintain your vehicle at any competent shop. If you follow the manufacturers recommended schedule and have documentation then you will have no issue with warranty.  Air and cabin filters have been an issue for a while where some dealers and some independent shops have been charging crazy prices and recommending way to frequent replacement intervals. In general terms, air and cabin filters should be replaced annually or every 20,000 Km. More frequently in severe operating conditions. Typical prices in my shop are in the $20 to $30 range for a quality filter, installed. (we do not charge for installation).  For those that want to do their own oil changes and think that they are saving money, think again. We charge $39.95 for a regular oil change and $79.95 for a synthetic oil change. Most weeks I have a special that is $10 off. This gets you up to 5 litres of oil, a standard oil filter, labour and a written 30 point vehicle inspection. Price out a 5 litre jug of QUALITY oil and a Quality filter and see how much you have left out of the above prices.  There are very good, average and not so good shops in this industry. The best advice I can give is find yourself one that has fair prices for quality work that you can trust."
936355,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-24 21:46:00,10439,You can't get a regular oil change up here for $80!!! And synthetic is $150-$200 to have done here. It costs me about $50 to do a synthetic oil change with a good Fram filter. Some times less depending on if my oil is on sale or not. I usually pick up a couple of jugs when it comes on sale @ CT.
936358,porkpie,2015-09-24 22:32:00,2521,"While obviously there are some shops that charge less for oil changes, in my neck of the woods it's at least $100 last I checked for synthetic oil change.  I buy in quantity when I find a good sale and come in at way less per oil change.  While a dealer is not required for service of an on warranty vehicle, I've found it removes all wiggle room from the dealer when a warranty issue comes to light.  To each their own.  It doesn't matter to me if folks want to pay through the nose for things, but not me!"

I have changed my own oil for my whole life and all of my vehicles just keep on running all while I have read about people having their oil changed at dealerships, quick oil change places and privately owned shops that had MANY problems too numerous to mention afterwards.

935810,crappieperchhunter,2015-09-22 15:22:00,2582,I bought a 2013 Hyundai Sante Fe in March of 2013. In the 30 months I have owned the car they have told me 3 TIMES my cabin filter is dirty and is due to be replaced. Today when I went in for my free oil change they even brought the dirty filter out to me in the waiting room and with everyone there looking on  mentioned how bad it was and strongly suggested having it changed. I declined as I really don't see it as an important thing just a money grab. In the 30+ years I have been driving this is the only vehicle I have owned that they have even mentioned a cabin filter to me. Before this I didn't know such a thing existed.  My understanding of it's function is to provide cleaner air for the interior of the car. My view is rolling down a window does the same thing. Can anyone with knowledge give me some insight on this. Is it a necessary filter  or is it a $90 cash grab.
935815,Raf,2015-09-22 15:38:00,3495,"13.49 on ebay, replace it yourself."
935816,DanD,2015-09-22 15:44:00,2223,"A cabin air filter does help with people that have allergies; it will filter out most of the pollen. Yes 10 or so years ago there were no such a thing as this filter; unless it was a very high end vehicle. What I'm seeing with these filters, is that the AC evaporator external fins are not becoming plugged up with crud; the filter is catching it. So to answer no it's not a money grab; but it's also not necessary to be there. If you wanted too, take it out and throw it away; just don't leave a dirty or plugged up one in there. It'll turn itself into a compost box and stink like somebodies business, once the dead flies and leaves start to rot.  Dan. "

Today, fans are plastic (housing and blades) as well as several fittings and bearings for air blending doors.  A cabin are filter is not a needed item, but it's nice to have to filter the air and protect components from contaminants.  $90 seems steep, as mentioned above, there are other options to having it replaced.  Your Owner's Manual should tell how to do it yourself, typically by unclipping the top runner on the glove box."
935837,adempsey,2015-09-22 17:07:00,1498,"That exact thing happened to me a couple weeks ago.  I went to my Mazda dealership for just an oil change, which is reasonably priced IMO, and they took it upon themselves to bring my air cabin filter into the waiting room to show me how horrible it was.   I said ""no, it's fine"".   They did the same thing to another customer that was waiting, but she bit.  I was pissed off that they wanted to charge me $60 for a $10 filter.   I never gave them permission to even touch anything else in my car.     Even worse, they obviously already did the labor and took the damn thing out and want to charge a ridiculous fee for putting in a  new one?    I decided to do it myself, which I have yet to do, lol.   So, timely post =)  I love it when they show you your brake pads too.  I will never go back there again.  They also dented my door the last time I was there to switch out my winter tires.  Luckily I have two good local mechanics that I've used and will just go back to them.  Is eBay better than going to APC or NAPA etc???"

Any filter can be purchased at CT or online for peanuts compared to the dealership.  Same with windshield wipers, go to costco.  The whole waiting room thing is just to try and shame you into agreeing to the $90 filter in front of other people, god knows you wouldn't want a dirty cabin filter."

Plus my time to do it. Plus the disgarding of the filter and oil. I pay $54 at the dealership to have it all done and just drive away in 20 minutes.Plus, I get to talk to the young fella doing it and learn about things that are going on with the new trucks. Yes, they let me stand there and watch them do the change. Also, I dont have the place or the new tools to do the job on these new models.  Now for your cabin filter  question.

935945,Bernie,2015-09-23 00:33:00,3190,It's an easy way for the guy doing your service to make a couple of bucks. They are pretty much giving you free labor to do the oil change in the hopes of making it up on some other items. Any filters I have seen in the HVAC are mounted before the evaporater core so they don't normally get wet. And it usually takes a long time in normal driving areas to plug them up. I find that many places want to change them far too early.
935955,FrankTheRabbit,2015-09-23 01:14:00,479,"I just wanted to bring to light to the fact that people want to be paid for what their worth and what they've spent time to be trained to do what they do. Too many people scoff at paying, what they feel, are ripoff prices. If you feel it's too much to pay for a service, it's certainly more than within your right to decline and shop with your money elsewhere. But to criticize the price and then say, ""I can do it for a whole lot cheaper!"", may indeed be fact, but it's just not being respectful to that person and their trained profession. It's not like they got their certification through some online course.  Imagine if your employer/boss said to you, ""You know what? I could just hire some Joe Shmoe in a 3rd World country to type out the reports that you do, for a fraction of what you cost. You know what...don't think I will pay you your wages because I think you're ripping me off.""  Some food for thought.  And no, I'm not an auto mechanic, but have dealt with people who feel that they should be paying less for the services that one offers."
935965,Smokercrafty,2015-09-23 01:51:00,227,"Good topic as I've also been hearing this ""cabin filter"" grab. I had a friend call me and tell me that the dealer wanted to change her cabin air filter every oil change she went in for. Asked me if this was right. Two sides to this whole situation..... I'm a truck technician myself, and do a lot of AC repairs at my job. For the truckers who run solely highway miles (long haul), it can be compared to a cars cabin filter, in that, you probably won't find it too dirty on an annual check, BUT, the vocational guys (dump trucks, construction based work), I've seen guys come in, with almost zero air flow through their vents, complaining how their AC isn't working. Well, after a quick look, their cabin filters may have well been a piece of plywood. They become so plugged with the AC moisture, and constant dust from job sites. A new filter, and presto, ice cold AC once again. So, all in all, it really depends on the conditions you've been driving in. If you're a construction site super, using your own vehicle and frequenting these areas, yes, you'll probably need a filter more often than your buddy working downtown Bay and Bloor. Normal city driving habits, once a year should do ya. What I try and do myself, is if I'm going through dusty conditions, I'll throw my HVAC system on recirc air until I'm clear of that area. A tip for you smokers, DONT smoke with your car in recirc mode!!!!  Or better yet, DONT SMOKE!!!!    lol."

935986,DanD,2015-09-23 11:29:00,2223,"I keep hearing dealership for oil changes, while the vehicle is still under warrantee? Have so many people been told that they'll void their warrantee, if it's not done by a dealership and OEM filters/parts? If so then you have been lied too; anything that is ""customer pay"" can be done anywhere you want. As long as you have proper documentation that the parts are SAE approved (the part number will tell them that) and the vehicle was serviced at the proper intervals; you've more then safe having the work done elsewhere or by yourself. The manufacturer cannot void the warrantee, if the servicing has been done properly.  Dan.  Here's a copy & paste after a short google search.  Car owners seeking to save money on maintenance costs may turn to independent mechanics and aftermarket parts as an alternative to typically pricier dealership service and factory parts. But the rules governing how these money-saving strategies may affect warranties can be confusing. Of course, all new cars come with a limited factory warranty. The specifics vary from company to company, but warranties are governed by law requiring full disclosure to the consumer of coverage and duration. Typically, there is a bumper-to-bumper warranty that provides three years or more of coverage, augmented by a long-duration powertrain warranty and/or corrosion warranty. The purpose of warranties is to ensure consumers that the product performs as promised, with the manufacturer taking responsibility for problems during a predetermined period. Included in the protections for reasonable use in the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is the right for consumers to have the vehicle serviced at a business of their choice and the option to use aftermarket parts, meaning potentially money-saving alternatives to those that came on the car, while retaining the original warranty. The automaker is not allowed to void a warranty just because a nonfactory part is used. Where things can get sticky is when the work or parts are associated with a problem are deemed by a dealership as not performing correctly or are otherwise defective. You have the right to seek alternatives to the dealer for repairs or parts, but remember that good work and good parts are key to a good ownership experience. Should something go wrong, the warranty provider will need to determine the cause of the problem. The Federal Trade Commission says, “The manufacturer or dealer must show that the aftermarket or recycled part caused the need for repairs before denying warranty coverage.” That means if the dealer can prove (the burden is on the dealer) the problem was caused by the wrong viscosity or a poor quality oil filter, your warranty can be denied. Warranty protection would still be in effect for other parts of the cars.   "
