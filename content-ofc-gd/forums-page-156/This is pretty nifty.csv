935774,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 12:00:00,8243,It's funny you show that Lew. I stopped to see a fishing partner before he moved to Paisley the other day. He made basically the same thing but it doesn't attach to the trailer. It has 2x12 inch tires on with ball at one end and bicycle handle at the other.it and we moved his welding machine easily. I never noticed anything like this an now 2 in a few days.
935775,DanD,2015-09-22 12:08:00,2223,"Looks neat for sure; but I think the first thing i'd do with it, is rig a power window motor to it and throw the hand crank away. LOL  Dan."
935776,Bernie,2015-09-22 12:14:00,3190,That's cool Lew.Haven't seen that before.
935779,captpierre,2015-09-22 12:33:00,2521,Slick. And handy for sure. Wonder what it goes for?
935781,OhioFisherman,2015-09-22 12:38:00,6623,Cool! I'll bet the blonde with the boat is pricey! LOL
935782,Fish Farmer,2015-09-22 12:41:00,2234,"Thats a great idea Lew for us old young guys. Now if I could get something to pull my boat back into my garage up a grade in my driveway. Thinking of a electric winch mounted in the back of my garage with a remote, old arm is not what it used to be."

935786,lew,2015-09-22 12:56:00,12766,"$340 sounds like a good price for that Dan, course it'd probably cost a bunch more when converted to Canadian funds.  Still be good for anyone who has trouble backing a truck up to a hitch though."
935787,Fisherman,2015-09-22 12:56:00,7201,"I had a similar contraption from P/A, 12V powered dolly.  It was ok on cement or pavement, once you hit soft ground or grass, it had absolutely no traction."
935876,davey buoy,2015-09-22 19:59:00,5505,"For a guy like me who mostly hooks up on his own,with the Xterra now i don't want to hit the bumper or license plate.Can take me up to 4 times to line up . Great idea,Thanks Lew,may well be a option for next season."
935877,wallyboss,2015-09-22 20:07:00,1095,Back up camera is fantastic just for that reason.
935883,davey buoy,2015-09-22 20:14:00,5505,"Back up camera is fantastic just for that reason. Another option ,that would sure help !"
