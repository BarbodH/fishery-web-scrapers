I have a 2011 Hyundai Tucson and it has factory rails but looking on kijiji has given me zilch and at least in the preliminary looking for a crossbar and j rack could cost me close to $500 after shipping, so being located in Hamilton does anyone know anywhere in the gta that will be able to set me up?  Any other input is always welcome too!"
936572,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-26 00:19:00,10439,I bought my crossbars online for my Honda Pilot. When I got my yak I purchased as set of Malone Saddle Up Pro kayak saddles that fit on my Honda cross bars. Got them off Amazon while I was in the US last year.  http://www.maloneautoracks.com/saddle-up-pro.php  Had a set of the J racks and didn't like them. They kept coming loose on my bars and almost fell off on the interstate because of it.
936574,bow slayer,2015-09-26 00:31:00,1074,"for my scanoe I use to use 2 2x4s bolted down to the roof rack with u bolts. It may have not looked pretty  but it worked perfectly for about 5 years with never an issue. It cost me about 20 bucks for wood and hardware and 2 bucks for pool noodle for some padding. That was way better then 300 bucks for a crossbars for my sv6. They should work for a kayak also,maybe with a notched out padded support ."
936577,fishing n autograph,2015-09-26 00:43:00,2540,I bought my crossbars at Sail for $115
936588,leaf4,2015-09-26 01:27:00,2466,"I'll have to check out sail... I've been perusing the interwebs during the intermission of the leafs game and came across these and I happen to have some 1"" tubing at the shop "
936591,porkpie,2015-09-26 02:12:00,2521,"I had mine welded up out of 1 inch tubing.  They work great, I also had eyelets welded on each end for ratchet straps."
936592,leaf4,2015-09-26 02:31:00,2466,"I could definitely do something along those lines... I like the eye bolt idea too, thanks"
