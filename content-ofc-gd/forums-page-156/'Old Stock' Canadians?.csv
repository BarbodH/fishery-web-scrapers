I just hear the provinces complaining so I thouht maybe there was a reason I need to pay closer attention  This is what they are complaining about. The Government of Canada announced in December 2011, that the CHT will continue to grow at six percent annually until 2016-17. Starting in 2017-18, the CHT will grow in line with a three-year moving average of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth, with funding guaranteed to increase by at least three percent per year. In addition the CST will continue to grow at its current rate of three percent annually in 2014-15 and beyond. The CHT and the CST will be reviewed in 2024.  I don't think it matters how much he gives the provinces; they will still want more.  They want to have a minimum increase of 6% per year.  The Liberals cut health and social transfers from $18.9 billion in 1993 to $12.5 billion in 1997.  The Liberals came to power in 1993 and it wasn't until 1999 they gave the provinces their first increase in funding after several years of cuts.   2003 was the first year that funding finally exceeded the level that is was at before the Liberals came to power.  If the Liberals had provided 3% annual increases it would have amounted to an extra $57 billion in transfers in the first 10 years.  Yet, they complain about Harper's plans to give them a minimum 3% increase (more if GDP growth supports it).

From my experience, the welfare leeches and good-for-nothings would tend to be categorized as ""old-stock"" Canadians. So please, let's re-examine who is feeling ""entitled"" here.  I'm not saying to just throw the doors open and let them all in, but to just shut it down is unacceptable.

Why should someone who has been in the country for five minutes be entitled to things I am not, when I have paid taxes here my whole life?  He didn't need to shoot himself in the foot.

Vs spend but don't tax then spend even more and don't bother taxing... 156 billion in red ink to give corporations the lowest tax rate in history and after 9 yrs here we are. 400,000 manufacturing jobs gone forever, highest trade deficit in Canadian history, dollar near record lows, infrastructure deficit almost as high as the national debt...  Shall I go on or are you bored with the facts of what the current government has actually done with our money so far? Trying to scare people of what other's MIGHT do worked for a while but when the above is what Harper and Co have done, I personally find it very difficult to see how anyone could do worse. LOL  The Funniest thing though is will all those tax cuts, is that Canadian corporations have an estimated 200 Billion hiding in tax haven banks doing nothing to contribute even to their shareholders as they aren't paying it out in dividends...

Being of Italian decent back then I was a visible minority. The first non WASP attending our grade school I leaned early what it felt to be treated differently. I actually had teachers and others speak very slowly to me so I could understand them. That was a long time ago. I received a failing grade in health habits. My parents were called in to explain why I wore the same cloths more than a few times a week. My American born mother went ballistic on them as my clothes were washed before every time I wore them. She went on to become the Prez of the Home and School association the next year.  Old Ironmaker , my point was that in the post war years what you experienced and  I too,  as I'm of eastern Soviet controlled European decent although born here was done because it was the right thing to do and no recognition was expected. Somewhere it started to be motivated by political gain and media coverage , both getting good or avoiding bad . In those days also there was not the sense of entitlement that a lot of them come here with lately and we are so eager to provide for. ( NOTE!! see political gain and positive or negative media coverage )"
