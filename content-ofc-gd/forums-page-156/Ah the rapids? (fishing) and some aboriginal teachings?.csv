935347,manitoubass2,2015-09-20 02:03:00,11391,"On a lighter note...  Not sure about skat bunk but in treaty 3 the humour is unreal! Even at the workplace its non stop jokes and everyone from chief down is fair game.  I will say IMO aboriginals have the best sense of humour  Heres another story to showcase that.  When I worked maintenance I always plowed this one elders driveway first. She was a sweet old lady and her husband had passed maybe 12-15 years ago.  Shed always invite me in for a quick cup of coffee and chat when i was done. Shed show me all her husbands fishing pictures etc because she knew I fished.  She was pretty incapable so I found myself taking out her garbage and just doing lil things to help her out.  Then one day after a coffee shes askes me to grab this garbage bag, so i do.  She tells me its full of her husbands underwear and she wanted me to try it on and if it fit i could have it???  Anyhow I quickly answered a work txt(ahem) and left.  At lunch i was at the band office with my boss and the chief and a few others. I told them the story and we are all just laughing.  My boss says"" $100 right now if you go there in your undies and give her a quick show""!  Nah man Im good lol  The chief backs it up.  4 others back it up  Others get back from lunch and back it up  Anyways by 2pm im up to like 1200 bucks and im all "" ah what the hell""?  Let me go have a a beer first and loosen up haha.  No prob, but you got dance for her on the lawn so we can watch???  Anyhow i head over there, lead her outside(she lives like 4 doors down from the band office)  Pull off my pants and shirt and give her a dance I hope she has forgotten.  After a few minutes she gives me a quick hug and just laughs. ""Your wife is watching""  Yeah i know, shes cool lol.  She thanks me for the laugh and i head back to the band office to collect my money.  I dont even think anyone worked that afternoon?  All we did was laugh"
935352,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 02:57:00,8243,"Sorry Rick, we drove out to Norfolk today to find some and all the tobacco is gone. Next year I will get some as long as I don't get any rock salt in my ass. Maybe I'll just ask. I think it is great to raise the kids immersed in their Mom's culture but make sure they know the other mosaics of your mixed DNA. I have a niece that anglicised our last name and do not like that one iota. She is Irish Italian but didn't like our Italian name I suppose. I have cousins that did the same to get a leg up in the 60's. We all  love her but I can't condone that. With your Mom there she can be a positive Nona. Don't lose who you really are in the conversation. You forgot the American part."

Its kinda weird cause its so blended and we teach the kids everything we can, but it all comes back to nature and thats what the kiddos really focus on so thats their decision.  We dont force anything on them(nona sure does hahahaha)  And ya know OI, those italian roots are very similar to aboriginal roots.  Yeah there is differences but alot of it is very very similar"

Even miigwich is spelled about 10 different ways lol. 45 minutes from me my spelling would be wrong lol, in big grassy its miigwetch"
935040,Moosebunk,2015-09-18 17:42:00,3970,"Miigwich bunk!!!  Im sure you've got experience to add as well!  I know it varies from area to area but is it similar in the skat?  Even miigwich is spelled about 10 different ways lol. 45 minutes from me my spelling would be wrong lol, in big grassy its miigwetch   Meegwetch!  Wa-chay or Wah-chay  Just on the James Bay coast alone are three different dialects of Mushkego Cree.  The R, L & N dialects.  R is more east where the language changes most.  Skat is N, Albany/Moose more L.  My name in Cree in Skat is ""Andano.""  Down in the Moose it's ""Andalo.""  Money as an example too, shooneeyan or shooleeyan.  Outside of the four in the healing cirlce (sage, sweetgrass, etc) feathers I find have a significant place in many ceremonies, as do other things from the land itself.  One example of something my brother-in-law did for our Uncle Stan's burial, eagle feather in the casket, as well as bringing hockey bag loads of sand and earth from Lake River (north of Attawapiskat) several 100 miles south to Moose Factory so his uncle could be laid to rest first on this soil and sand of his favorite place on earth, before his grave was filled.  That sort of ceremonial practice isn't just tradition to some, it's very cultural.  Before 12 months is up since last fall, I'll have been back six times for work.  Looking forward to working in Nunavut this fall or winter as well.  Plenty people come and go from the north only staying short periods, it's easy to walk away that way.  A decade and family later, time is too invested and I can't stay away.  These places have their issues, but they are better natural worlds, often without the different issues more urban places have elsewhere.  It's cool your path Rick keeps one foot on each side..."
935046,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 18:04:00,11391,"Thats awesome bunk!  Money here is shooneyah.  Yeah feathers, especially eagle feathers are very sacred. From traditional burials to smudging to regalia its all very important.  Also other items such as wolf teeth or bear teeth or claws, porcupine quils too!  Its a whole other way of life and I enjoy it very much! Its so much more respectful to nature and people then ""most"" other areas and im not saying that to disrespect anyone.  So many examples.  Where else would a bear, hit by a train, stop a work day? I noticed the bear, placed the call to an elder. Work was shut down and me and 3 other friends buried the bear with a tobacco offering of course, with almost the whole rez behind us in support. Thats a pretty common thing around here.  Also, you'll never starve or go without on the rez. If you have tough times everyone chips in to help basically. I sprained my ankle badly and had to take two weeks off work, guess who mowed my lawn? The cheif lol.  Its just an awesome way of life.  Ive never been a religous guy, but ive always been spiritual. And when I met my wife our ways of life just combined very harmoniously?"
935048,AKRISONER,2015-09-18 18:20:00,5558,"hey manitou,  without spreading more information than youd like to, i was wondering what your situation started out like with your wife. I.e. I dont think im entirely clear on your status vs your wife?  Did you grow up on the island/reserve or did you come back to it, or perhaps you are living on the reserve because your wife is full status? or maybe you are both full status and have been there your entire lives?  just curious as i find your ""process"" very interesting and inspirational. Even more special is from what it sounds like that you have strayed but come back to being at peace with the world. I sometimes really struggle to describe the personal connection that I have with nature and in a lot of ways envy your way of doing things. I think in a lot of ways I totally understand the connection your culture maintains with nature and our surroundings and feel that its unfortunate that a white kid like me can really only maintain that appreciation and understanding individually. Pretty sure id be thrown in the loonie bin if someone saw me laying tobacco lol."
935051,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 18:39:00,11391,"Im italian/german/norwegian. Im not aboriginal at all.  My wife is 100% and is from manitou(rainy river first nations)  All my kids are status and go to ojibwe classes rather than french.  But ive always walked my path with nature.  So when we met I was accepted in the community very quickly.  I was raised in fort frances which is a pretty rascist town towards natives. But wven in high school I always got along with all the natives(there is 6 reserves in the area)  I was a skateboarder/hockey player so I got along with everyone. Which was really cool.  Haha they used to call me white nanabush teasing me.  I struggled with PTSD later in life(im not gonna get into that) but that led to alcohol use and benzos to cope( only for about a year but what a crappy year lol)  But ive always been so close with nature that I guess, like bunk, you just fit right in.  And its a really beautiful, respectful way of life. I really dont know how else to explain it???  We dont hardly watch tv(baseball football golf and hockey are the exceptions lol)  Bit a typical night here is eating well, fishing/hunting with the dogs, my wife beads and does leatherwork for tobacco carriers etc. The kids go to bed and I make harnesses while she beads/stitches/sews etc  Lotsa foraging in the bush too. Hanging herbs and making teas.  My wife is elk clan so she cant eat elk or deer/makes her sick. Big nono to eat the animal of your clan."
935054,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 18:48:00,11391,"  Here is a lil story that kinda shows the point.  5 years ago our lovely boxer, pheonix, was poisoned to death with anit freeze. It was tragic to us and our kids.  Our kids are fluent in ojibwe and take classes at school so they have a good understanding of nature/along with our teachings of course.  They asked to lay her(not bury her) near oneof our favourite shore fishing spots where she would accompany us( yes same spot I just posted in my thread but up the hill)  We layed tobacco and thanked her for all ahe had given us and wished her a speedy recovery back into nature.  We went for a visit in the winter months and tou could see that rodents etc had fed from her.  Thats when our kids started to understand the ""shes gone but shes not gone philosephy"", she contributing to other life.  We visited again in spring and all our kids cried. She was surrounded by wild lilies(my wifes favorite flower) and we were also pregnat at the time.  So when our daughter was born, it was a no brainer, she was lily.  Things come full circle.  Just thought id share that with you  Miigwich(thank you)  Rick  This is a little story I shared via pm that kinda shows abit of our beliefs"
935056,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 19:02:00,11391,"What I do for work disturbes me however.  I do have a large family to support(including my mom, our dogs and cats)  I really struggle with it(mining)  Ive never layed soo much tobacco in my life.  I hope the earth understands our dilemma, but im a huge hypocrite along with many other band members.  Im not a fan of raping the earth(but I do realize on many levels of societal issues its a necessity. If it isnt me itll be someone else.  I try to justify it by telling myself im educating others along the way and im there to make sure earth is respected.  Our last project I had 200 guys of all races laying tobacco down every morning before shift started lol  There is 12,000 15ft holes in the ground with tobacco at the bottom of each one.  One day i arrived and a redtail hawk was next to our work trailer. It was awful sick, just sitting there with its head buried in its chest.  One guy tries to grab the bird and about 8 white guys gave him crap and said respect that bird, let it be. Its bad on you to damage an already sick piece of nature.  I almost cried lol. They had mostly all become much closer to the earth and nature on that project and that was really cool!  We had 6 guys from kenya working there too and we hit it off right away. Awesome people with massive respect for the earth. Amazing cooks too!  Anyhow look at me ramble???"
935058,AKRISONER,2015-09-18 19:19:00,5558,the story about your pup and lilly brought a tear to my eye...i hope i can pay similar respect to my buddy when his time comes
935059,Steve,2015-09-18 19:26:00,2075,"m2, awesome stories.  thank you again for sharing."
935068,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 19:47:00,11391,"Thanks guys!  Here is a crazy story(also explains why Im in so tight with local Co's)  About 4 years ago I was bass fishing the rapids with my kids.  Two natives were attempting to spear stugeon. 2 well known drunk guys(yes the rez has its problems like bunk said)  Well they finally get one, good one too about 60lbs, perfect for smoking.  They asked if I wanted it. I said no thanks i dont have a smoker and its illegal for me to possess that fish.  Ah they said then will give it to your wife.  Thanks but no thanks, my wife is in toronto on business and i have no use for a sturgeon.  Ok well see ya later rick. Okay guys take care and off they went in a truck with the sturgeon in the bed  Me and my kids finish fishing and walk home.  That friggen sturgeon is on our front lawn!!!!  Now im freaked cause if I get caught with this im losing my license for sure, not to mention the fines and the ""poacher"" label.  I call three different sturgeon smokers and nobody want just one, just not worth the time, ughhh.  So I pick up the sturgeon and start the 250 yard walk back to the river. Trust me that was hard.  I get the fish back in the water and start trying to revive it. Now these are tough fish but that fish sat on my lawn mid summer for a good two hours.  So yeah im having trouble reviving it.  Guess who comes? Yep, MNR. Im thinking oh my gawd im never gonna be allowed to fish again  They pull up. Introduce themselves and ask me what the .... im doing?  So I explain and plus I got no rod or anything so they know im not lying.  They get outta the boat to help. Took an hour to revive that fish and it did swim away(i hope it lived)  The COs gave me cards and thanked me a whole bunch for doing the right thing.  Of course I lied and said I didnt know who left it on my lawn(i know i know but I still believe if was a nice gesture gone wrong)."
935069,Steelheadphycho,2015-09-18 19:50:00,470,Your a special person Rick. One of the main reasons I enjoy these forums so much!!  Miigwich for being YOU!
935070,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 19:51:00,11391,Makes me cry just to read it.
935087,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-18 20:24:00,627,Did you ever think of putting your thoughts on paper for publication? Your way with words and explaining a tranquil way of life have opened a lot of eyes and minds in the last little while. My own understanding has been changed regarding the rice situation on Pigeon Lake.  Miigwich as well.
935099,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 21:00:00,11391," Thats is truly appreciated?  My intentions here are just to bring a little bit of teachings and ""bridge the gap"" between aboriginals and all settlers.  And just keep things interesting of course.  My love for nature includes humans lol, I think its important to educate or just share some perspective so others can understand.  Like my wolves vrs husky thread lol, i got a little blasted on that but hey, thats how we live. I love my dogs just as much as anyone! I would never ever do them unjust harm, they are family.  I know my posts can be a little ""alien at times"" but its all good. I hope people understand or I can help them understand at least. Life here is different then the cities, and even small towns for that matter.  Its really cool though when I get questions on a thread or via pm and 99 times out of a hundred we have great talks both ways.  OFC really is special too and ive never seen a community online be so awesome!  Many posters dont agree with me but thats cool too! It opens up discussion and hey, we all love nature/fishing/hunting/food etc. Its a real cool bond and I wish people outside this community have the same/similar experience.  Moosebunk is hands down one of the best posters here. And hes basically right on the same level as me(but he catches way better fish lol)  Thats kinda off topic but its just awesome to see people interested in our culture. Really makes me happy?"
935100,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 21:05:00,11391,"Never ever thought of that.  Maybe I should? Who knows?  Personally id rather see a book from solopaddler lol, or even moosebunk.  So ill take your post as an extreme compliment.  I dont think im good at writing or storytelling myself.  Who knows? Maybe one day"
935166,smitty55,2015-09-19 04:14:00,928,"Well this thread has surely morphed nicely. Last time I was here it was only a dozen or so posts. Very cool the turn it has taken. Rick and Drew I hope you keep it going. It's so refreshing to actually hear of the good side of the native culture and lifestyle for a change.  Rick, I too really enjoy your posts. It's great to get a little peek in to your lifestyle from ""northern Ontario"" as well, native or not. Truth be told, IMO many ""big city"" folks from southern Ontario don't really have much of a clue about actual rural lifestyles, and just don't understand. Not a fault for the most part, it's just hard to conceive for some people if they've never lived it or maybe had family members that did. Urban living hunters would have more of an idea. Hell, I only live 30 minutes west of Ottawa in bush/farm country and hearing gunshots anytime of the day or night even, any season, is no big deal at all usually. If A Bear wanders by, that's cool, neat to watch. If you really want it to hurry on just make some loud noise for the most part is all you need to do. Or maybe in season get the gun out and fill a tag. Right on!  One more thing Rick. When you say ""Many posters don't agree with me"", I for one think you're totally wrong. The odd one maybe, always will be, but not even close to many. I'd wager that by far most folks find your character and postings quite refreshing and kind of unique on a ""Fishing forum"", if you catch my drift. I also appreciate how you say ""but that's cool too! It opens up discussion and hey, we all love nature/fishing/hunting/food etc.""  Kinda laid back, easy going feelin...  Hopefully this threads keeps growing. Cheers guys."
935167,manitoubass2,2015-09-19 04:44:00,11391,"Thats awesome smitty! Miigwich!  Yeah maybe the times are a changin' lol.  I used to get alot of flack around here at times from a certain few. In fact I even left once outta frustration lol, came back and couldnt remember my password and thats why its manitoubass2 now ????  I hope moosebunk chimes in more too!  As far as laid back that pretty much nails it. Whether its on the board or in person thats just my character. It wasnt always that way though.  Again thanks for the kind words and I hope this thread keeps ""morphing"" too lol."
935169,manitoubass2,2015-09-19 04:56:00,11391,"Here is a funny lil story.  After the oilfields i really needed a break. So I took a job on the rez as a maintenance manager. Job was cool(pay sucked lol). And I basically did like 6 jobs at once. In fact it was so bad, we had a 35 hour work week and i was constantly in trouble for working 80 or 90 hours a week lol( but i was used to that because the oilfield)  Anyhow i was just new to the rez and I was accepted right away like I mentioned.  In my downtime I would plow every driveway on the rez, bring food to elders etc, you know, just be good to people.  Ine day im plowing this elders driveway and she comes out yelling at me(shes pretty well known for being a pain lol)  She shouts""your not plowing my driveway right! You shouldnt even work here white man, taken jobs away from our people!""  I was shocked! First and only time I had been subject to racism on rrfn.  Anyhow, I jokingly said ""ok kokum(grandma), grab a shovel!""  I backed out and drove off.  Next day I get called in from the chief and im thinking oh my here we go.  He tells me she complained, asked what happened so I told him.  He says well good, its all settled!  A little shocked I said um ok? Thats it?  Yeah, i just got back from town, i bought her a shovel  ????"

Last week, each day, before my line hit the water, I'd reflect on how fortunate I am, look at the remote landscape around me, and give tobacco. Some people in this world don't have enough food to eat but I'm lucky enough to be able to take two planes to get to a special place to go fishing. How does that work?  Nice smallies Rick, great post."
935337,Moosebunk,2015-09-20 00:59:00,3970,"Just finishing a two week orientation to the hospital in 2000 and beginning a nightshift.  Quite green still to nursing with only a little E.R. experience.  No significant training at all to Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Trauma practices.  Other nurse attending the ward patients...  Ambulance drops a 21 year old man on the single stretcher in the E.R.  He's been clothes-lined by a telephone pole guy wire doing about 80km/hr on his skidoo.  Onto our monitor and checking responsiveness...  One pupil reacts, the other doesn't.  FTW!!?  Check again, neither respond.  Monitor shows a heartbeat, patient is pulseless.  FTW!!?  Call ""CODE BLUE.""  (in Skat this means, security starts phoning on-call RN and anyone available at home and willing to come in and help)  Four days of the month an MD comes to town, he happens to be in the Doctor's suite and is called in this time as well.  Despite 50 minutes of effort we lose the man... likely to hemothorax.. or cardiac tamponade.. maybe combined with some other sort of hypovolemic shock.  When I came out of the ER room the hospital waiting room and reception area was full with people.  Probably 100 or more.  As many as could fit in the doors.  So many crying.  The Catholic Priest soon arrived and a long ceremony took place on the spot.  All the words he spoke were in Cree.  The people sobbing... even howling some of them.  The impact of this incredible.  A mourning unlike anything I had ever witnessed, and extremely powerful in that moment...   Couple days later the town laid that young man to rest.  It was my first funeral in Skat.  The Stores, School, Offices... EVERYTHING shut down during those hours.  The entire community stopped to pay respect.  The church exploded with people and the community channel broadcast the entire thing.  From the church the Pallbearers carried the casket down the road to the grave site, while so many walked along with.  It is always like this.  Nearly 10 years later when my wife lost her sister, it was even more cogent...  Despite hardships known from isolation, past repression and also, many peoples personal choices and attitudes as well, one thing which I have learned to really quite admire of the northern Cree culture through years spent is, the incredibly deep roots to community and family.  My only wish would be that I could see it more often from even more people, and see this more often too from outside of tragedy and loss, and instead in everyday normal life."
935344,manitoubass2,2015-09-20 01:33:00,11391,"Man bunk thats horrible but so true.  3 years back we had a horrible year for community losses. Seemed like every other month a respected member was gone.  All funerals here are traditional, no priest. The funerals can be very very long. And i mean long18-20 hours.  That year we lost two war vets. One was natural deathe the other was hit by a train. I was first responder with the fire crew then and i didnt even need a call, i could hear the screams from my doorstep. He was cut in half and his family was there and lets just say in my shock, i did the best I could to hide the body from his family  I dont know how you do it bunk? Itll haunt me forever listening to the screams and cries as we try to find half a body with body parts scattered  That year my wifes cousing also had a stillborn.  All maintenance was off on vacation so it was my first funeral I had to do and it was so overwhelming. After the funeral it was pouring rain and he didnt want anyone to help but family, so after a whole was dug and we dropped her in, tobacco layed, everyone but me and my brother in laws stayed and it was so wet and muddy we buried that pour girl by hand. Not like shovel in hand i mean literally by hand.  Ugh i have so many stories  Next one wont be so bleak"
934698,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 21:27:00,11391,"Had an hour to spare today and the weather seemed perfect for a topwater bite at my favorite shore spot, so off I went.  Only had and hour and the weather changed as I drove in so I was kinda hesitant.  But an hour is better then nothing?  Got there and it was dead calm and muggy as heck. It went from sunny to cloud cover right away as I lay my tobacco down in the water    The scenery was a beauty as always! Lotsa stugeon jumping as well as bass, so I knew I made the right call to go topwater!    The bass were smashing my bait! Only used that one lure the whole time?     After a few missed fish I slowed my walk the dog and left longer pauses. It payed off with 5 good bites. All shorter fish but starting the feedbag! And its only gonna get better! Even a 2lber fights like Mohahmed Ali in the rapids!  This fish smashed me 15ft from shore and boy did it have shoulders!    All in all it was a great hour but boy did it go buy fast!  Soon they will go from NFl footballs to CFL footballs???  Ill be there all day tomorrow?  Miigwich"

934719,Gerritt,2015-09-16 22:24:00,6129,Nice!!!!! I'd like to understand the importance of laying tobacco down though as an offering.....  I'm sure you'd have a more detailed description then what Google could offer

934723,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 22:30:00,11391,"Tobacco is the most sacred of all medicines in aboriginal culture.  Its an offering to the creator to give thanks and appreciation as well as pray for the health of whatever it is you might be doing. In my case Im praying for the health of the river and its bounty.  If you ask an elder for teachings or advice you always offer them tobacco as well, as a way of appreciating their help/guidance.  Before you bang a pow wow drum you must feast it, offering food, tobacco and sage. Drum carriers must also be sober.  If you encounter a dead dear say(as per my husky thread) you lay down tobacco as a thanks, and a speedy journy to its next life.  Tobacco and sage, sweet grass and red cedar, very important to the natives. To us it is medicine, it is prayer, it is spiritual..."
934724,ketchenany,2015-09-16 22:58:00,3229," Thanks, lesson learned. Always want to know different cultures.  On the lively side  I don't smoke, what now?"
934725,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 23:06:00,11391,"Pouches of loose tobacco lol, not smokes"
934726,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 23:09:00,11391,"Smoking is only done for cultural use at traditional funerals (through a pipe, its passed around and you take one or two puffs)  Hunting, similar as funerals, and at healing cerimonies like powwows and sweat lodges"
934731,Gerritt,2015-09-16 23:26:00,6129,Thanks M2..... So this is cured tobacco leaf? The stuff put into cigarettes? Or is it something else? Very interesting... Thanks for taking the time to answer..... Sorry I don't mean to derail this thread.... Pm me if you prefer! Some nice fish BTW
934732,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 23:42:00,11391,I did pm you gerrit  No cured tobacco leaf is just not available for the most part.  Unfortunately its come to using processed tobacco.  Id grow some but id be in jail rather quick
934738,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 23:49:00,11391,"And your not derailing gerrit, my pleasure to help educate?  Many aboriginals to not follow""the straight path"", much like other cultures.  So teaching feels good to me. Maybe help some board members understand why I do what I do??? Never know  But I get great pleasure knowing when people understand how far some go to be apart of and protect this earth.  Im not perfect. Ive strayed as well. But I do my best?"
934739,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 23:50:00,11391,Thanks davey!!! Yeah it went by way too fast!
934741,Steve,2015-09-16 23:56:00,2075,"I'm going to be honest M2, I believe your posting has made me a better, more tolerant person.  Due to the Caledonia situation(s) here in the Hamilton area, not to mention the Hagersville thefts of trucks, I've had a HORRIBLE attitude towards natives.  Many times I've read your posts, whether they are related to your family (again, who are beautiful), your cooking, your dogs, your practices, and now your customs, as a result I've become a much more tolerant person.  Thank you for taking the time to share your culture, and even more so, thank you for being patient with the intolerance on this board (which I more than contributed my fair share towards).  My very best friend is half native (mom is 100%, dad is not), and he himself has separated himself from everything that is native....however, rather than do the same, you embrace and do your best to change (or at least, help us understand better).  You're a good person.  Thank you for taking the time to post.  Cheers.   (edited for grammar)"
934742,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-16 23:59:00,627,"It would be nice if some folks around here (both white and native) would take the time to try and understand each others thinking on the rice situation. For now it has kind of gone on the back burner, but I believe it will smoulder until next years growing season. It's a shame for sure."
934744,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-17 00:01:00,8243,I live 20 minutes from Tobacco country. There are still a few farms here. Shall I send you a few leaves if they are still in the fields?  I don;t think so though as it should all be hanging in the sheds by now.  Steve spend some time out on the rez. have a meal or a coffee (tax free). It is 10% of the goofs out here causing 100% of the problem. Most of the militants don't even live here.
934751,manitoubass2,2015-09-17 00:15:00,11391,"Wow steve that actually made me tear up.  That means alot?  Old ironmaker, sure if ya can do so. Thats would be very nice and a great gesture.  And yes, the ricing. Ughhh this one bugs me, just like the nipissing overharvesting.  Im not gonna say much(but OI said it pretty well), if aboriginals would live on the straight path you'de almost never see these situations take place.  But its very complicated. Many of the generations we live with now are very damaged for numerous reasons( im not gonna get political here).  I wish they would get back on path for the sake of themselves, their families, nature, and relations with all north americans"
934803,gordy28,2015-09-17 11:23:00,638,Great report and the custom info is awesome - like others have said i learn a lot from your posts Cheers Gordy
934807,Acountdeleted,2015-09-17 11:47:00,2562,Nice! I don't know if there is anything better then too water bass.
934808,wkrp,2015-09-17 11:48:00,656,Interesting information about tobacco and your culture.
934810,DanD,2015-09-17 11:56:00,2223,"I did pm you gerrit  No cured tobacco leaf is just not available for the most part.  Unfortunately its come to using processed tobacco.  Id grow some but id be in jail rather quick  It's more then legal to grow tobacco for personal use; but there is a weight limit of 200lbs (I think it's 200) of cured leaf tobacco in your possession at any one time. I grew up on a tobacco farm and yes there are licenses and quota that a farmer is required too have, to grow it commercially. So next year, head down South here to the Simcoe, Delhi area and buy a few hundred plates from a farmer; while the greenhouses still have the plants in. Mid April to early June would be about the right time to get mature seedlings ready for the field/garden. When My dad was still growing; we'd always had people coming too us wanting to buy seedlings. They'd plant them in their gardens and flower beds. Believe it or not they're a very nice looking plant; when you;re not looking at them in a 50/100 acre field; with thousands of them a foot and a half apart from each other. I'm also talking tobacco tobacco, not wacky. LOL Dan."
934827,manitoubass2,2015-09-17 13:19:00,11391,"Thats very cool! Learn something new everyday!  I guess I made the assumption based on pure nicotine, which is one of the most restricted compounds around.  Man if I could get some alot of people around here sure would be happy about it!!!"
934843,DanD,2015-09-17 14:43:00,2223,You could also start from seed if you wanted; you can get it super cheap on Ebay.  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Spicy-Acres-500-Del-Gold-Delgold-Organic-Heirloom-NON-GMO-Tobacco-Seeds-Cigar/111766416848?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140620091118%26meid%3D3d18c572284f4b35acb6e428ec360be2%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D151813186166  Put together a make shift greenhouse and you could likely google the growing process of how to get the plants started. They are a very fragile plant and the slightest ground frost or insect infestation will kill them easily.  Dan.
