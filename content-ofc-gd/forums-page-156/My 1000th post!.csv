I read this board every day at least once and often more so. I don't often post or comment, so this is why it has taken me so long to get to this milestone.  I don't fish nearly as much as I used to, so my my boat gets used much more for family day trips and cottage rentals on my favourite body of water, GBay. I have camped and fished the Moon River Basin and Massasauga PP since 1988 and just love the whole area. As a teeager, my buddy had a cottage on 12 Mile Bay just south of the Moon so that was when I first got to know and fall in love with the area. We have since been renting a cottage on 12 Mile from 2002 to present.  I don't have many pictures to post because this BB limits the file size so it is not easy to put pictures up to link to a post here.  Enjoy!  Me and the Legend!   Tubing many years ago on 12 Mile:   Fun time rock jumping with our dog Sandie lifeguarding:   Swimming out at O'Donnell Point:   The lighthouse at O'Donnell Point, notice the big line of quartz:   Sneaking into the camera shot:   The flat rocks of American Camp Island:    "
