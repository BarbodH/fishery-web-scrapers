935502,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-21 01:45:00,8243,"Lew I just read what you wrote, that's tragic. It just shows how fragile life can be.  Rick you must be dumping your chamber pot out the window for all those critters to stay away. Why you don't have those pests is beyond explanation. Where are they? Inside the puppies?"
935505,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 01:53:00,11391,They could be lol.  But id imagine something critter could get in there.  The bushline is like 10ft from the back of the shed where the holes are.
935506,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 01:53:00,11391,And yes Lew thats a brutal story?

935512,cram,2015-09-21 02:43:00,1733,"Pee on the garbage, and take a crap in the groundhog holes.  "
935530,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-21 05:43:00,8243,The critters really don't bother me much unless I have to clean up after them. I just like saving water from not flushing.
935532,dave524,2015-09-21 10:29:00,4508,"Its a christmas miracle I dont have skunks, groundhogs or raccoons here.  I store my garbage in the shed and it has holes in the walls lol.  No garbage service here so I only do one dump run a week about 15km away  I thought for sure skunks would be a huge issue when we moved in here  I would think the bears, wolves and dogs would keep them away."
935536,lew,2015-09-21 11:05:00,12766,A few of the homes on my road are using these steel critter proof garbage bins now. Very expensive at around $600 and up but they sure keep the animals out. I've seen them rolled over several times by bears trying to get in and not even a mark on them.  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCoQFjABahUKEwiQ8Mm5_IfIAhWJS5IKHfHVDWQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftyedeebin.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNG0VZLV-dmtSDvq6l-DufdZGS7W6g
935572,muddler,2015-09-21 14:39:00,623,When I used to grow sweet corn in my garden the coons ate most of it before I had a chance. I read in a gardening magazine once to get fox urine sold at hunting stores.  Figured what the heck and gave it a try. A few drops on some of the out side row plants. Worked like a charm. Reapplied after a rain. Never had anymore coon problems after that. Used it for years then I started having squirrels getting my corn. It didn't seem to faze them  If you can still get it try the fox urine.  How do they get the fox to pee in the bottle?
935575,crappieperchhunter,2015-09-21 14:46:00,2582,  How do they get the fox to pee in the bottle?  Not sure.....but I think it's put out by the same company that puts the caramel it those caramilk chocolate bars
935577,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 14:51:00,11391,
935581,Headhunter,2015-09-21 15:01:00,5703,I had a problem with coons getting into my green bin... until I got a dog. Just put the dog poop in the garbage and the coons will not go near it. HH
935358,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 04:57:00,8243,I was telling a pal that I have to lock my garbage up in the shed and he asked why? Why? Because they dig around and leave only the bones for me to pick up. He says he leaves his garbage out and urinates around it and doesn't have a problem. It actually sounds logical. So I did this today. Does anyone else piss on their garbage? I hope Mrs. Richter next door doesn't call the cops.  This isn't a Johnny D Corleone buster. Straight goods ????
935381,Gallie,2015-09-20 13:44:00,1215,I might have to try this and get back to you...
935382,NAW,2015-09-20 13:49:00,4022,"I can just see it now.  Put my garbage can out on the curb the night before garbage day...  Whip it out, and give her a good soak.  Neighbors kids down the road putting their garbage out at the same time.. . .  Officer, I am trying to keep the coons away.  Trust me!  I read it on OFC!!"
935384,FloatnFly,2015-09-20 14:05:00,1640,"I built myself a garbage box out of plywood, and painted it with a water proof paint for this reason, skunks and racoons were getting into it. holds easily 6 bags of garbage, plus 2 recycling bins and a green bin.  now my only problem are the flies and resulting magots.  hate this 2 week schedual to get rid of garbage"
935386,Joey,2015-09-20 14:25:00,9122,"Hmmmm, wonder if woman pee works as I'm the one who does the garbage.  Think my neighbours may wonder why I'm squatting on the corner though  I'd probably for sure get arrested.  Think I'd rather pick up bones"
935387,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 14:39:00,8243,"I'm thinking about just putting it in a spray bottle, like my BBQ flair up water. Hold on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,my wife's saying there's something sticky on the concrete pad by the shed!  Ooops."

935406,Big Cliff,2015-09-20 17:06:00,6899,"We have a family of coons that moved in to our area this summer, the keep pulling our composter apart and also come up on the deck to get the feed we put out for the birds. They are so bold that even when I try to chase them away they just sit there. The other night I threw my shoe at one of them to try to get him to leave, within a minute he was back with three others. I walked back in and got the .22 figuring I'd shoot one of them and they'd get the idea, opened the door and never even got the gun up to my sholder all four of them were gone and didn't come back the rest of the evening. let me know how the pee thing works!"
935408,fishing n autograph,2015-09-20 17:43:00,2540,Hahaha.... I'll look forward to the Hazmat call lol

935428,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 19:48:00,8243,Actually it is a good point labeling stuff. I had a guy on my crew that actually kept gas in Coke bottles in his garage. You can guess what happened when his kids saw the Pop bottles. Idioto. The kids came out OK as they both played ball for Mac and one went on to play in the CFL. Thank God it didn't turn out tragically. I reuse spray bottles all the time and mark them with a Sharpie. I better mark the urine spray clearly or our BBQ might have an acrid taste to it.  Note: don't put gas with 2 stroke oil in the lawnmower or in a pop bottle.
935429,Rodbender,2015-09-20 19:50:00,1027,I can't say coon here let alone say I'm peeing so a coon doesn't come and eat my garbage (ajax) they throw me away for being Prejudice Might have to add the RA before coon
935430,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-20 19:51:00,8243,"Fox urine, that is my theory with my urine. It can't be very attractive to critters. I can see me on Dragon's Den. There will be plenty of people willing to make money at home without leaving the bathroom."

935433,lew,2015-09-20 20:02:00,12766,Actually it is a good point labeling stuff. I had a guy on my crew that actually kept gas in Coke bottles in his garage.  A long time friend of mine who's been dead now for many years  was in his garage one night with 3 buds. They were all drunk and looking for more booze. They found a gallon bottle on a shelf marked alcohol and they drank it.  My friend woke up hours later totally blind and his 3 friends were dead.  Turned out it was wood alcohol (methanol)  My friend never regained his sight but he was the lucky one.

I have a solution for the red squirrels but it doesn't just repell them. We had a good relationship until they decided my attic was going to be their new home.
935488,Moosebunk,2015-09-20 23:45:00,3970,"Late June found this guy hanging around the side of the house...    Today...    They're crafty rodents.  Bren snared the first, the momma.  Today we got this one.  Still thinking there's one more around.  Critter ridder, moth balls, vinegar... nothing like that gets them gone.  Even this trap it managed to get in and out of many times without setting off the door.  Last fall it was skunks digging up the grubs over the septic tank and bed.  Destructive but not as worrisome as a family of groundhogs burrowing around at the side of the house."
