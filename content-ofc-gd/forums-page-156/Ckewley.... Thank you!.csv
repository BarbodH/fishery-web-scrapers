934857,ckewley,2015-09-17 16:16:00,699,"Thanks, you didn't have to publicly thank me, thought I sent some chocolate habs too.....probably not dry at that point, I'll rectify that"

934872,Dan668,2015-09-17 17:28:00,1120,"Sweet. Where abouts you pick them up? I planted some red habeneros i believe which surprisingly came out great this year, looking for something a notch up."
934882,Gerritt,2015-09-17 18:40:00,6129,"Lol try a hundred notchs up...... I used to eat habeneros as a snack.... Right off the plant just to see my friends cry..... (This was years ago!) I was immune....  These peppers are no joke, and shouldn't be taken lightly.  G"
934885,manitoubass2,2015-09-17 18:53:00,11391,Yip. Habies are just a joke when it comes to heat(scoville scale)
934888,Dan668,2015-09-17 19:04:00,1120,"I know.  I eat them whole all the time. i usually buy hotter stuff, but this year was my first time growing my own.  That was the hottest seed i seen at the supermarket sadly.  I tried ordering ghost peppers at work,  but they never show."
934890,ckewley,2015-09-17 19:17:00,699,Ok Dan PM me your addy & I'll help you out with some seeds. I got my last harvest coming up soon & will sort you out

935121,davey buoy,2015-09-18 22:53:00,5505,"Nice score there !!,I have a 1 ounce bottle of Flashbang.3.5 million on the scolville scale.One drop to a full pot of chili lol.Will last a lifetime.Has all the hottest peppers pretty much in the world,and then some.To give a comparison,Franks red hot is 450,not even a 1000.Cost was $30 a ounce from pepper palace at Casino Niagara.Was just given some Indian and New Zealand hot peppers,quite a burn from them as well.Will be planting them next year. This site sure has the best members.!!!!!!!!!!"
935203,ckewley,2015-09-19 15:00:00,699,"You guy's are making me feel all warm & fuzzy. I generally don't spend allot of time in forums because they usually boil over into crap pots. I do have one movie forum & pepper forum (whiteboard actually) that are fantastic & the more I spend around this place it is becoming my first stop, this place does have some really good folks easily the best for fishing forums that I've come across.  Davey buoy which Indian & New Zealand peppers did you get? Flashbang is some deadly stuff, as far as superhots go it had less of a metallic taste than most extract's which is a huge plus in my books."

Not really sure ,as they were given to me semi ripened.Will have to dry out and remove seeds eventually.Very ,very hot close to the stem.will post a picture later if your interested of the two?.Brings a tear to my eye, the Indian seems just a tad hotter,but the burn goes away quite quickly.As for the Flash Bang,just nasty,really can't enjoy imo."
