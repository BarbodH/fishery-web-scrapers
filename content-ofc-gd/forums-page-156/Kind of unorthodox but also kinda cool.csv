935808,adolson,2015-09-22 15:03:00,783,"I need one of these! Probably thousands of dollars out of my price range in this lifetime, though.  Edit: looks like they'd cost around $2000US to deliver to Canada."
935812,netminder,2015-09-22 15:24:00,514,"My dad was telling me about this on the weekend. Interesting concept... but if I'm about to buy something in this price range I'd rather just get a used tinny. On the website they're listed $1,595 (but sold out). My only question is how do you transport it?"
