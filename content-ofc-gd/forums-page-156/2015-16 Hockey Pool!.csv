935969,FloatnFly,2015-09-23 03:00:00,1640,"pm stoty and get him your email address, he'll add you in, and we can run the draft anytime before the season starts"
936193,Stoty,2015-09-24 02:56:00,2910,We've now got our 8 teams. Thanks everyone.
931240,Stoty,2015-08-25 17:01:00,2910,It's that time again! Annual OFC hockey pool! Open to the first 16 people who reply with their email address.  Wonder how high Kessel will be drafted this season?! LOL
931244,BillM,2015-08-25 17:37:00,17367,While playing besides Sid?  Top 5.  He is going to rack up the points this season.
931249,Stoty,2015-08-25 18:22:00,2910,With the amount of Kessel lovers on here...I wouldn't be shocked he goes #2. Lol Or....are they all Kessel haters now?!
931251,hutch4113,2015-08-25 18:29:00,374,"Sure...what are the details on it (costs, etc.)."
931252,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 18:32:00,11391,Yip im in  Whats the details?
931256,Stoty,2015-08-25 18:50:00,2910,"No cost or anything, just for bragging rights.  Head to head scoring - you're against a different opponent each week. The teams are compared in various stat categories and you get a head to head record from it. (8-1-1 for example if you beat your opponent in 8 categories, lose 1 and tie 1). Your records are year-long and each week is added to the previous total.  Example Week 1 - 8-1-1      Week 2 - 4-5-1      Week 3 - 5-3-2 Overall record would be 17-9-4  Anyone that wants in, please PM me with your email address and I'll send the pool invite."
931262,manitoubass2,2015-08-25 19:43:00,11391,Sounds fun!
931285,muskymatt,2015-08-25 22:18:00,2608,I wonder how many laffs will be chosen
931437,chris.brock,2015-08-27 00:01:00,4053,"Good to have you back running it, lots of glitches last season   I'm in."
931438,Stoty,2015-08-27 00:11:00,2910,When would be a good time for everyone for the live online draft?  Mid Sept? Any week nights that people can't do?
931439,grimsbylander,2015-08-27 00:19:00,3016,While playing besides Sid?  Top 5.  He is going to rack up the points this season.  Gee I hope so. My aunt could get points playing with Sid. We'll wait though and give Kessel the credit. LOL
931588,LostAnotherOne,2015-08-27 20:36:00,956,"The talk about Kessel being on the same line as Crosby reminds me when Heatley signed with San Jose and he was going to be paired with Thornton.  I think and hope Kessels gonna finally get 50, but when it comes to the pool I wonder whos gonna take the chance and pick Edmontons 1st overall pick.  I remember Crosby and Ovie getting 100 points there first season."
931592,Stoty,2015-08-27 20:43:00,2910,"I run another pool as well, which is a keeper pool and I have 1st pick this year. McDavid is going #1. Lol"
931595,manitoubass2,2015-08-27 20:49:00,11391,Damn i gotta set up a yahoo account lol  This gonna be fun!
931731,tb4me,2015-08-28 19:07:00,3295,Count me in again this year.. [emailÂ protected]
931733,leaf4,2015-08-28 19:54:00,2466,"I'm in a pool with work on this site, works well. You pick at the beginning and have 2 trades to use during the season. then let the season begin  http://hockeydraft.ca/standard.aspx"
931981,FloatnFly,2015-08-30 21:11:00,1640,"Finished fourth in this last year, only cause i was hospital for 5 days and couldn't get the right players in, damn emergency surgeries.   hopefully will do better this year"
933053,Stoty,2015-09-07 20:11:00,2910,"Still a few spots left. We currently have 7 teams, but need an even number to run the pool.  LIVE ONLINE DRAFT Mon Sep 21 7:30pm  Please PM me your email address and I'll send out the invite!"

935677,FloatnFly,2015-09-21 23:51:00,1640,"still need one more team, not able to start the draft yet"
935678,hutch4113,2015-09-21 23:53:00,374,Ok.  Did not realize we were down a team.  Too bad...I was all setup (no....not really....)
935682,tb4me,2015-09-22 00:12:00,3295,someone should just create a second team
935741,chris.brock,2015-09-22 03:40:00,4053,"I was at work and assumed I would auto-pick,  So what happened? It looks like the draft got buggered up?"

935935,Jigger,2015-09-23 00:06:00,1237,Count me in if there's room! Missed out last year...
