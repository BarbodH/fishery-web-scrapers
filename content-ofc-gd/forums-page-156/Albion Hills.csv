935588,sneak_e_pete,2015-09-21 15:28:00,540,Thinking of taking my 3 boys there this weekend camping.  Cant find anything about the fishing there on the net.  Panfish for them would be great  Anyone have any info or recommendations for another spot close to Brampton / Oakville area?
935596,shimano19,2015-09-21 16:00:00,196,I used to catch lots of suckers and bluegill there when I was younger. Also some decent smallmouth around
935600,sneak_e_pete,2015-09-21 16:12:00,540,Ok...bluegill would be great for them.  Thanks!

935605,Acountdeleted,2015-09-21 16:32:00,2562,I reccomend Heart Lake or Island Lake over Albion. The rec centre at Albion is beautiful and the trails are nice but the fishing is sub-par.  Sometimes big bass come out of Heart Lake. At Island the Bluegill and Pumpkinseed are the size of a small dinner plate. Sure to entertain.

I go to Island Lake with my wife who is definitely not an angler, but I set her up with a worm and a bobber and she can't keep the sunfish off her hook (which I inevitably had to remove unless she remembers her ""fishing gloves""). Some of them are definitely dinner plate size. The perch seem undersized there (at least the ones I catch), and there are definitely a good number of smallmouth and rock bass to be caught. Just keep in mind they are into their ""fall"" operating schedule so the gates don't open until 8."

935662,misfish,2015-09-21 22:11:00,29133,I reccomend Heart Lake  Sometimes big bass come out of Heart Lake.   That lake still produces fish? I remember catching rainbows there and lots of cat fish and the odd lm bass. Many summer vacation days spent there fishing as a young fella. Would ride my 10 speed up there.
935731,Acountdeleted,2015-09-22 03:17:00,2562,They still stock 1000 rainbows a year. Usually when I go fishing there I'll land a largemouth or two over a pound and a half.  First time Nikki ever went fishing there she landed a 5 pound monster. It's a surprisingly good lake.
935758,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 09:23:00,8243,"How about lake Niapenco, Binbrook conservation area on the outskirts of Hamilton. Blue Gill, Crappie, Bass, Pike and Perch. It's close to home and once out there you would think you are up north but 10 minutes to civilization, well Hamilton anyway."
935788,sneak_e_pete,2015-09-22 12:59:00,540,All great suggestions!  Thanks!  Will let you know where we go and how we make out
