Checked on them today and the first had 38 videos (2 minutes each in length.) Much to my surprise, videos 1 and 2 showed two bucks sparring! Definitely my best trail camera capture to date.  Definitely a 'feeling out' kind of tussle. That will change in a few weeks when it will be an all out war.  Cams were set up on the NCC Greenbelt here in Ottawa.  Will be back to check the cams again in a couple of days - looking forward to seeing what I've captured this time!  (watch in 1080p HD for best quality)     Cheers,  Justin  "
