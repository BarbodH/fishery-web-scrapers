935696,kickingfrog,2015-09-22 01:22:00,8333,"My brother and I were on the road extra early and made the drive north for some birds. All along it was likely going to be too hot, too green and too thick, but a day off is a day off and this way if the trip was a bust we had 3 easy excuses.  The area we tried first is closed to all vehicles which is great... later in the year when much of the growth has died back, but this early it was silly with growth over our heads in many spots. It was a tough go and really hot. We weren't seeing or hearing any birds. The decision to head back was made and maybe take a chance on one of the atv trails instead. On the way back I did get a single and maybe things would get better.      Back at the truck while we had our lunch the weather started to cool a little. Off to another trail and we're having an easier go of things but still not seeing any birds. Then, the day changed in a wingbeat. We are surrounded by birds and they are flying everywhere. We get some, miss some, find some more, get some more, miss some more and after it's all over we had five birds, I've got one shell left and we're not sure how many birds there were in total.    Back at the truck for more shells and to put the birds on ice. We'd used up all of our luck as the last 3 birds we see are still in the woods and only one of them even heard a shot and a jack pine was the only thing hit.Great start to the season and the hunger has been satiated for now but the colours will come, the air will turn cold and I will hear the frost under my boots."
935708,Beavertail,2015-09-22 01:48:00,331,Very nice! What a great start to the season. It would be nice to get some cooler weather now.
935716,irishfield,2015-09-22 02:10:00,26272,Good shooting!  I just reach and touch them to make them get off my deck !
935719,kickingfrog,2015-09-22 02:17:00,8333,I was in your neck of the woods but I'm pretty sure none of them were your pets.
935724,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 02:45:00,11391,Awesome!  How ya gonna cook em up?  Some of the best tasting meat out there IMO  Great trip!
935735,irishfield,2015-09-22 03:24:00,26272,If you want to go out to the island Rob you're welcome to them... they leave an awful mess! The 9 of them usually hang out around the slide...
935755,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 05:30:00,8243,"What does Grouse taste like? I've had 1 good Duck the rest  not good, Goose was as dry as a 2X4 and greasy. Quail I find really nice but I need 6 to make a sangwich."
935756,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 05:42:00,11391,Unreal good OI.  Nothing like duck
935771,pics,2015-09-22 11:50:00,1268,Grouse is very good.. pound the breast flat and roll in bread crumbs with parmesean cheese and fry in butter... Spruce Grouse isn't my favorite though..
935777,Rod Caster,2015-09-22 12:23:00,5784,"We were camping/fishing/hunting up in that area as well this weekend. I wonder how close our paths crossed?  We scored a few spruce grouse, but no ruffed."
935806,highdrifter,2015-09-22 14:26:00,2534,That's awesome.  Looks like it's gonna be a great fall for upland birds!
935887,misfish,2015-09-22 20:29:00,29133,Nice shooting by you and your brother Rob. Im going to miss shooting those fine eating birds.
935890,manitoubass2,2015-09-22 20:36:00,11391,Chop em up and cook em in mushroom and wildrice soup with celery and carrots   Mmmmmmmm
935895,NAW,2015-09-22 20:53:00,4022,"Good stuff Rob!!  My hunting partner bought a dog this year and is working on his NAVHDA certs.  Next year is going to be fun!!!!  They went out last weekend and flushed two birds, but he couldn't get a good shot off."
935912,dave524,2015-09-22 22:09:00,4508,"Good shooting!  I just reach and touch them to make them get off my deck !  Tie some string to a stick and prop that box up with it, spread some seed under the box and run the string back through the patio door or is there one already under the box"
935915,irishfield,2015-09-22 22:31:00,26272,"No need, they're not scared of us, we can walk up and grab them by the neck!"
935924,Weeds,2015-09-22 23:04:00,782,Wow. Nicely done! The grouse in the public lands I hunt around Peterborough are incredibly difficult to get. Still looking to get my first. They spook so easily you rarely get anything resembling a shot.
935926,Beavertail,2015-09-22 23:06:00,331,"Complete opposite of southern birds...avian spooks. Flushed birds are more often heard than seen, the ones I do see mostly flush out of shotgun range at Mach III. I consider myself very fortunate when I harvest a Ruffie!"
935930,kickingfrog,2015-09-22 23:58:00,8333,"Yes, big difference between northern and southern birds in Ontario.  I hunt grouse in southern Ontario because it's where I live and it is a real challenge. I make the occasional trip north to eat some birds and remind myself why it is worth it in the south.  I like to cut the breast into strips and soak them in buttermilk with a little kosher salt added (iodized salt is not good for this, I've been told). Drain and roll in panko or regular bread crumbs (sometimes I use crushed cornflake just like we did when I was a kid). Fry in a cast iron pan with a little oil."
935948,Moosebunk,2015-09-23 00:45:00,3970,"Great shooting Rob.  Sitting here with my old hunting and trapping buddy Abel who hunts plenty too, he says they're nice ones!"
