935627,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 18:13:00,11391,Loose fit might be correct because it comes on and off. More off then on but still
935634,DanD,2015-09-21 19:04:00,2223,"To many variables to give you any real direction; would need a proper scan tool connected to read sensor live data and that's just to begin diagnosing this issue. That being said does the transmission (assuming its an automatic) still shift normally when the speedo is inop? If not it could and I mean could be the vehicle speed sensor on the trans/transfer case? As for the ABS, yea it's likely one of wheel speed sensors; but which one? Again a scan tool would be needed to monitor each wheel watching if one of the sensors are dropping out? Now don't go out and buy one of those cheap code readers; thinking it's a scan tool. A code reader is just that it only reads emission related codes. Most cannot read ABS, body computer or anything other then powertrain  ""P"" codes. Places like crappy tire sell them in the hope you'll plug it in, see a code for whatever and then run in and buy the sensor that the code is related too. Sorry for your luck, you bought it, you plugged it in; its now yours forever; no return on electronic parts once plugged in.  Dan."
935638,DanD,2015-09-21 19:14:00,2223,Wayne I'm pretty sure the speed sensor in the differential is for the ABS; the vehicle speed sensor is on the rear of the transmission or the rear of the transfer case if it's a 4X4  Dan.
935639,manitoubass2,2015-09-21 19:25:00,11391,Thanks dan!  No i was told for the sensor theyd need to use a chip while driving the vehicle.  It wont show unless your driving.  Does that make sense?  Like i said im no mechanic and i have zero issues paying for it to be fixed properly
935644,DanD,2015-09-21 20:14:00,2223,It wont show unless your driving.  Does that make sense?  Yup
935647,irishfield,2015-09-21 20:33:00,26272,Lots of confusion with Jeeps... took me days of wasted reading to determine that on this vintage of Jeep libertys the speedo is fed off the rear diff sensor or at least was on the 2005 I was working on with no ABS. Many jeep forums have guys going in circles swapping out transfer case senders only to find out their rear axle sender harness was grounded out against the e brake cable. Owner had no speedo at all when I told her I'd look at it and it's still working 5 months later is all I know. First replacing the sender and repairing some wiring (which made it intermittent) and then fixing the quick plug contact for a permanent fix.
935657,DanD,2015-09-21 21:40:00,2223,"You're 100% right on this one Wayne; the rear wheel speed sensor is the the signal for the speedo; after the signal is sent to the body control module. From there the signal is converted from analog to digital  and sent to all of the devices that need to know vehicle road speed. It took a bunch of reading in the service manual and checking wiring diagrams but I do concede. LOL  Rick there is a self test that you can try; that will or should prove out the instrument and whether the speedo issue is in the cluster or an input to the cluster. Ignition off, press and hold the trip odometer button. Turn the ignition on but do not start the engine. Release the trip odometer. This will put the cluster into a self test; meaning it will sweep all the gauges, turn on and off different cluster functions. Once done all you need to do is shut the ignition off and that will cancel the self test. What you're going to be watching for is whether the speedo can sweep its full travel;  the speedo needle will stop during the sweep at calibrated check points but it should go through the full scale.  Dan.   "

Everything is amazingly good EXCEPT the electric fans wont come on, the electric fans are original 05 part  Replaced temp sensor still no luck,  all codes are clear but it is sensing the engine is cold when its not, just been doing small trips around town''  Any easy fix like a relay etc, to all the back yard mechanics and full time thx in advance John"

934886,DanD,2015-09-17 18:54:00,2223,"What does the temp gauge read on the dash? If the gauge is functioning that tells us the the PCM (computer) is receiving and properly interpreting the coolant sensor's signal. Both the IPC (Instrument panel) and the PCM use the same sensor signal (kind of). The PCM will not turn the engine cooling fans on until engine temperature reaches approx 98C (210F) and then it'll only turn on the one fan. At approx 105C (210F) then both fans are commanded on by the PCM. If the truck has a functioning AC system; the one fan would be commanded on as soon as the AC pressures reach a certain pressure. Without a proper scan tool, there's no other way to force/fool the PCM to turn the fans on. Has the truck actually overheated? Get your hands on one of those infrared thermometers and test the actual temperature of the engine. Princess Auto sells them for about $25.00. Take temp readings at the upper and lower hose to engine connection housings. You may have a thermostat that's stuck open and the engine has not reached the cut point for the PCM to command the fans on? If the engine is actually getting hot enough for a fan request; you should be able to hear one, two or all three relays click on. If so then it will be time to see if one or both fans are getting power. Use a test light connected across the two terminals of the disconnected cooling fans (both) connectors; one at a time. The engine will need to stay running; the PCM will shut fans off when engine is turned off. If the test light lights; then you likey have burnt out or seized fan motors. Again if the test light lights, plug the fans back in electrically and then lightly hit the fan motors with a small hammer (Don't beat the crap out of them) Sometimes the motor""s brushed will get stuck and not make the internal connection to the armature; this light tapping may jar them loose and get the motors turnning again? I know more questions then answers and now that I've likely confused you completely; try and answer the ones you can.  Dan."

934930,mr blizzard,2015-09-17 23:39:00,1589,"hey dan. this is this guys son. Im working on the truck. The code I get off the code reader is po118. This is saying the ""engine coolant temperature circuit high input"". Now it still says this after I replaced the coolant temp sensor. My buddy was saying to check the relays (replace if I have any kicking around) and then try it again. Ill take the truck down the highway for 5 minutes, sense its getting warm, pop the hood and then disconnect the sensor. The like a whirlwind both fans come blazing on, I look at the temp gauge in the truck you can watch it spike right up to about 3/4 hot then instantly fall right down to the 75ish mark (lowest setting) on the dash. I will see if I can round up some relays and go from there. if that doesn't work the other option is to gut the electric fans and put on 1 big clutch driven fan like some other models had, which will delete this issue. Ben."
934931,davey buoy,2015-09-17 23:44:00,5505,"I.m thinking like Dan here,have you changed the thermostat yet?,Does your rad have a lot of the fins folded over?."
934933,mr blizzard,2015-09-17 23:55:00,1589,"Davey bouy  we replaced the thermostat when we replaced the engine, the fins are totally straight no folds"
934940,Freshtrax,2015-09-18 00:34:00,2215,Simple fix it to run the power from the fans to an ignition hot power supply ie .   Daytime running lights ect .  That way the fans would always be on while the truck is running and the thermostat could do the work from there.    It's a fix that would get the truck back on the road until you track down the gremlin.
934948,mr blizzard,2015-09-18 01:34:00,1589,"Thanks Freshtrax, never thought of that"
934960,huzzsaba,2015-09-18 03:42:00,884,I would suggest starting with replacing the thermostat  again in case the one you replaced is faulty and then make sure to get all the air out of the system by burping the system when filling. Not sure if these engines have a bleed valve. If it does make sure to bleed the system of air. Also check to see that all wiring related to the cooling system and fan are plugged in.
934982,DanD,2015-09-18 12:12:00,2223,"hey dan. this is this guys son. Im working on the truck. The code I get off the code reader is po118.

Ben.  Are you sure that it's not you that's setting this code P0118? If you unplug this sensor with the engine running for any longer then 20 seconds, this code will set. The PCM will go into a form of limp in mode and command the fans on. The PCM also defaults to 80C which in turn drops the temp gauge in the dash to just off the cold mark. When you say that you can sense the engine is getting hot; what does the temp gauge say? Don't bother with the relays, you say the fans come on when you unplug the sensor; so we know they're OK, along with the wiring to the fans and the fan motors themselves. I would like to know what the voltages are on the signal return wire, at the temp sensor connector. Ignition off disconnect the temp sensor; turn the key on engine off (KOEO) measure the voltage at the signal wire (yellow wire) it should be around 5.2 volts. Making sure that the ground lead of the multi-meter is connected to a known good ground. If the voltage on the yellow wire is way above the 5.2v start looking for a short to power. If voltage is way below 5.2v start looking for a short to ground or an open in the circuit. Open meaning a broken or corroded yellow wire; somewhere between the sensor and the PCM. There's more tests we can do but let me know these results before going any further. Depending on what you tell me, we may need to stat back probing the PCM and disconnecting the PCM to continue the test.  One last thing make sure that the engine is actually getting warm/hot. Let it sit & idle, it can take up to 20 minutes before a fan request can happen. If the engine does actually starts to overheat; you know what to do; UNPLUG THE COOLANT SENSOR LOL or have a hose ready and soak the rad down, until the engine cools. Driving down the road there's air flow through the rad; so even on a hot day while driving the fans will rarely come on. Not unless there's a mechanical issue causing the engine to become hot.  Dan."

I am no mechanic when it comes to cars, I never have been this all sounds like rocket science to me. But the funny thing is I had a similar problem and I tapped it with a small hammer to get it to work. That I can do. When in doubt smack it!  Good luck on the truck Blizzard."
935005,DanD,2015-09-18 13:42:00,2223,"Yea I know what you mean. LOL You should see my electronics work bench; scan tool, oscilloscope, multi meters, amp clamps and a HAMMER! To tell you the truth there is a prescribed test that all manufacturers use; it's call the tap test. You connect up the oscilloscope to lets say a mass air flow sensor, start the engine and then hit the sensor. If you see a glitch in the sign-wave replace the sensor.  Dan."
