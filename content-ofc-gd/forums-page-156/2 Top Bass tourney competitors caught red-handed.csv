935760,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 11:15:00,8243,"Great question Steve. I'm interested too besides guiding, rec fishing and tourneys. I think it's great to have tourneys, especially kids derby's. Derby's are great for kids introducing them to fishing. As well everyday Joe's like myself might get lucky and take a few grand from the pro's in my lumber jacket sans logos in a weekend local tourney. Some young gun local guys took top prize at a Pro Walleye 444 tournament on Erie this summer. Those with boats worth 100K or more all decked out like a Nascar driver and car shed so many tears that the lake went up an inch. Oh guess what? A few thought they must have cheated to take top prize."
935785,OhioFisherman,2015-09-22 12:54:00,6623,"http://www.ibassin.com/2015/09/caged-bass-reveals-cheaters-at-2015-top.html  "" The two anglers who allegedly planted the basket of bass were not at the tournament meeting. On Saturday morning, day 1 of the two-day tournament, the accused two-angler team arrives but had yet to officially been checked into the tournament. While on the water, competitors quickly confronted the two anglers.  The alleged cheaters broke away from the pack of boats, loaded their boat and left."
935790,SmokestackLightnin,2015-09-22 13:02:00,390," Go on......I've yet to hear what bass tournaments do for the fishery.  Well the first one that comes to mind is the Stoney Lake Combo which only pays back 60% of the entry fees.  Yet year after year it sells out with 135 boats with all the money raised going to the Dummer Douro Fire Department.  Now the money does not go into the fishery but the money raised over the years, and we're talking over $200,000, benefits the entire community.  For specific fishery related benefits you may have to look at the anglers and not the tournaments.  Just like PGA tour pros do so much for local communities and charities, the tournaments themselves are to showcase the golfer's talents.  Oh, and there are numerous examples of cheating on that stage as well.  Use Google, type in Ontario Conservation Projects and you will see many local BASS and other tournament groups cleaning up streams, rehabilitating spawning beds, adopting highways and taking pride in winning conservation awards.  From there I would suggest you look at some the anglers, many of whom post on this board and Google their names.   One would be Dave Chong and his Catch a Dream Fishing Derby, it doesn't directly benefit the fishery but man it sure does a lot for Big Brothers/Big Sisters.  This event has a huge positive impact on kids and adults but Google will tell you Dave does a whole lot more."
935793,porkpie,2015-09-22 13:16:00,2521,"I think there is a small segment of tournament anglers who do lots to promote the sport of fishing and certainly there are side benefits to some communities and some youth groups etc.  I don't think there is any real benefit to having 100 bass boats ripping around a lake all weekend though.  I don't think the majority of the ""tournament pros"" do much for the fishery.  I'd call most of them wanna be pros to be frank.  There are very very few real ""pros"" in Canada who actually make a living at the sport, and those few that do have have a finger in a lot of pies, not just tournaments.  A lot of those bigger names do actually spend quite a bit of time doing special events, working with kids, and promoting the fishery and they have my respect.  But a dude with a bass boat and an ego just gives me gas.  As for the cheating, well it happens in lots of sports, that's the nature of man.  I can't say I love tournaments, but I'm not against competition so I can't see why the fishermen can't have them.  At least these guys got drummed out, and it will likely be quite a while now before someone try's again considering how these dudes got hammered by the court of social media."
935794,OhioFisherman,2015-09-22 13:21:00,6623,"http://www.ohiobass.org/Board&Officers/Conservation/conservation.htm  Some of our lakes here have big draw downs in the fall, it is pretty common for bass clubs to get involved with the state and plant habitat for fish, it doesn't just benefit the tournament angler."
935833,farsider,2015-09-22 16:55:00,456,"I would think the MNR should get involved. The ""witness"" screwed the pooch in his excitement for any chance of a fraud, cheating, or anything related to the tournament type of criminal charge.  There is a violation of ""not having your name and particulars"" on any type of holding pen.  If they (tournament officials) retained the fish, there is a slim chance they could discover if they were moved from one body of water to another which is also a violation.  Other than that, public shaming might be it.  Cheers, Mark"
935836,Old Ironmaker,2015-09-22 17:05:00,8243,Thanks for the information Smoke Stack. I know of many tournaments that have 100% payout to attract the money guys. Besides a small economic boost to the Marina and local area not much if anything is put back into the resource.  That Musky guy from the Detroit River that was caught on video killing Musky then latter went on TV shedding Crocodile tears sure wishes he had simply paid a fine and no one is the wiser. Humiliation through social media is the 21st Century's public flogging in the town square for all to witness.

Well if you look at the entry fees I am guessing some have a partner and enter bass tournaments to reduce costs. If you have a non paying observer you may have to reduce entry fees and payouts, which may reduce interest?  Draw tournaments where you draw for a partner might help, it would make planting fish a lot harder if you have a partner that you don't know? One of the bass clubs I fished with had boat owners and non boat owners, boaters drew from a non boater pool for a partner. I never had a non boater partner put a legal sized fish in the boat though, some would not even accept tips, offers to use lures I was catching fish on. When you get to choose your own partner you also get to pick one that has a clue?  I don't see any easy answers, it would be nice if people were honest?"
934619,lew,2015-09-16 13:09:00,12766,"8 or 10 years ago myself & a friend entered an on-line musky tournament thru an American musky board. It was for anyone in North America and each month you were matched against a different team. There were 48 teams and  each month the winning teams  would advance to the next round and the losing team was eliminated. The tourney went from June thru November and you were awarded points for each musky caught.  The only stipulation was you had to show pictures of each fish caught and give the size of each one and other than that you were taken on your word for your catches. Each picture had to have an item in it with a different object each time and you were only told the day before the match what the item would be. It could be a basket ball, beer glass, stuffed toy or whatever. This was just to prevent anyone from posting an old picture of big fish.  The best part was there were absolutely NO prizes awarded to the winning team other than bragging rights and the 2 years we fished it there was never even a hint of anyone cheating...nothing at all.  We beat out 47 other teams the 1st year and came in 1st place and the 2nd year we came in 4th out of 60 teams.  I think as soon as there's prizes, specially big money purses, your gonna have cheats and I don't know how you can eliminate that.  Stinks that it happens, but that's life and ain't nuthin gonna change that.

There has been only two other recorded incidences within thirty years in Southern Ontario, both with convictions. The CSFL’s expectation of its anglers is to maintain the highest level of professionalism just as they can trust the CSFL to do the same in upholding its position as an organizer to maintain the integrity of the sport, in deterring this type of behaviour and ensuring that the CSFL is not opposed to utilizing the lie detector test and working with law enforcement to make examples of those who think they can take advantage of the dedicated anglers and organizer’s trust. This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and will not be welcomed in any CSFL event or any CSFL supported events.

But they will lay in wait to charge a couple of guys having a lite beer on a boat, I don't agree with beer on a boat for the Capt, but jeeze, a guy has 2 beers and they nab him or her. Sad.  I understand by the reports the MNR was called and they advised if they get involved, they would only release the fish .... much like the coppers, they wouldn't do anything"
934402,Gerritt,2015-09-15 01:22:00,6129,"Steve is right, a lot of fishermen are talking about it....  The more we place this under the spotlight the better.  There are eye witness accounts of what happened on that day.... Some of them want to see charges brought... Can't say I blame them!  Tournament fishing will always be around, so it's best to expose those that break the rules and cheat for gain.  I for one hope these fellows get charged, given eye witness accounts I'm sure they have more then enough to lay charges.  Time will tell..... This is blowing up in FB right now, and the other competitors that fished this tournament are upset.....  And rightly so.... Remember the musky guy??  G"
934404,Steve,2015-09-15 01:25:00,2075,i'm not on FB.  i know of the one FB post (shawn i believe) where it was originally reported....  any other FB posts on the subject?
934410,OhioFisherman,2015-09-15 02:02:00,6623,"I didn't see anything else Steve, but I did find this.  https://www.facebook.com/bassfishingcheaters?fref=ts  This kind of thing has really been going on a long time, it's really no different than poaching or keeping over your limits? Money makes it worse?"
934413,Dutch,2015-09-15 02:18:00,831,"This thread isnt about banning tournament angling. It has been around for decades and isnt going anywhere.  The more people that see this thread, the better. It will serve as a deterrent to those thinking about making a quick buck.  Lets get back to the topic at hand.  Anyone know these guys or have any idea if they are saying anything?  I think their only move is to come clean, pay back the money they ""won"" and then go hide under a rock and never try to compete again.  Top Bass hasnt said anything yet. Im assuming they are consulting a lawyer,which will take some time."

934270,OhioFisherman,2015-09-14 14:18:00,6623,"Summary of the situation from my third hand knowledge:  -2 alleged cheaters (and an assistant) were observed laying down in their boat in the reeds.  They were pulling up reeds and such and laying it over an area as a canopy.  This was witnessed by a competitor who just luckily happened to be driving along a road.  They saw something weird as they were driving so they parked up the road and snuck back down on foot to observe.  They then recognized the boat of the competitors who had come out of nowhere to win 3 events and finish 2nd in their 4th event.  They waited for the perps to leave and then went to investigate - found a basket device holding bass and contacted OPP and MNR.  OPP said that no crime had been committed as yet so they could do nothing.  MNR was just going to let the fish out of the baskets.  The basket were 2 laundry baskets zip-tied together.  They were then weighted down and covered over with reeds and such and placed in an area unlikely to be encountered by other anglers.  After finding the first basket, they were able to find 2 others in the area (presumably since this was a multi day tournament they were going to have to come back on day 2).  The perps skipped the meeting the night before where the attempted cheating was addressed.  They did show up on the morning of day 1 of the tournament - when confronted - they turned tail and ran and will probably never be heard from again in tournament circles.  However, they stole close to $20,000 this year if they cheated in the 3 events they won plus the 2nd. Based on the situation, I personally find it hard to believe ANYONE could give these clowns the benefit of the doubt though at this point.  The pictures of the fish they are holding up in their victories are consistent with fish damaged by being held in basket type devices.  Fin damage, scale damage etc.  Unfortunately everything is circumstantial.  I doubt the anglers that were cheated of close to $20,000 will ever see their money which is a shame.  Yes it would have been much better if feasible to somehow mark the bass, set up cameras, put the crime scene back together, say nothing and then wait for the guys to bring the fish in each day and then try to collect the 5 figure payday.  I'd think a $10,000+ theft or fraud would carry serious implications.  BUT, I also understand the emotions of the guy who found the basket and understand that the organizer when contacted would have been somewhat at a loss as to how to act on a somewhat unprecedented scenario.  Really tough pill to swallow for me that these guys got away with it.  Regardless it's a sad day and black eye for a sport I love.  Charles    It is unfortunate they weren't caught red handed, the whole deal sounds to me like they were cheating. Just from my experience in tournaments it is rare for some one to win two back to back, I personally wouldn't have entered one that had someone in it that had been accused of cheating.  It also puts the people running the tournament in a tough spot? Can they legally refuse to allow an entry from someone accused but not caught? Hopefully peer pressure will prevent that from ever happening, plus the risk of a beat down if they do?"
934272,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-14 14:24:00,4399,I don`t think you have to worry about that...I don`t think these two idiots will show there face around the tourny circuit anymore!

934285,glen,2015-09-14 15:45:00,2641,Thanks for all the good info people. The guy that found the fish should have called the tourney director.

934289,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-14 16:18:00,4399,I would imagine the embarrassment that these two asses will suffer will not be worth the paltry sum they stole....I hope this story trends for a while yet....perhaps some news/magazine coverage....

934293,mattybculp,2015-09-14 16:29:00,388,"Well as an angler present at this weekends top bass tournament, as well as all of the other tournaments in the schedule this year, I was taken back when evidence was brought to light as was every other angler I spoke too. it was quite the chat around the launch and boat inspection area and at the Friday night pre tournament meeting (which I was not present, just got a phone call Friday night informing me of the news ). All of us were disgusted with the news, we all rely on the honesty and integrity of all the teams, however unfortunately when there is significant prize money on the line some individuals will go to any length, it isn't the first time this has happened and sadly wont be the last. The individual who discovered and witnessed the first basket, I cant say I know him well, but I believe is a credible individual. Could this stand up in court with how it all went down? probably not. There was talk about how it all went down and different guys had different thoughts on how it should be handled. When they discovered the baskets apparently a call was made to the director, whom I am made to believe (hearing third person of course) requested the baskets be left and discussion on how to deal with this would be made. However the angler decided to bring forth the evidence. Like I said that is what I heard from fellow competitors Saturday and Sunday. Some were saying to clip each of the fish let them fish and allow them to weigh in, and then contact OPP and present all of the evidence at that time. We were all saying there is no way these guys will show up to fish Saturday morning, as what was to be a secret by Saturday morning amongst the field, was no secret. I believe contact was attempted to be made with the accused Friday night, and during the confrontation Saturday morning well lets just say you had to be there to form your own opinion on there reactions. Can you pin all of there other wins on the season on cheating of course not, but don't think I'm not skeptical. Everybody here can have there opinions, I have mine just like the 73 other boats and anglers there this weekend."
934295,mattybculp,2015-09-14 16:31:00,388,Maybe there are some other anglers on here from the tourney who could chime in.
934296,OhioFisherman,2015-09-14 16:33:00,6623,"It's a mess, they fished 2012-13-14-15, they didn't do bad before 15 in a large field, but all at once consistent winners? How long had they been cheating?  Like Steve says, you need proof to start taking things way? and even if you got the cops involved there has been plenty of time to hide or destroy evidence that a search warrant might reveal, if you could find a judge to issue one?"
934297,GbayGiant,2015-09-14 16:36:00,1780,"There's a long list of ""pro anglers"" who cheat. It's nothing new to the, sport?"

The MNR should take a long look at these ridiculous bass tournaments and get more involved!"
934306,FrankTheRabbit,2015-09-14 17:04:00,479,"There are some warped minds out there when people fish. They'll convince themselves any way possible to justify their methods to get that extra edge.  Some ProBass fellas have the mindset that it's ok to target bass before the legal opening date, as long as they catch and release. If people think like that, it's no wonder they will convince themselves to cheat and be able to sleep at night.  Even instances where anglers fishing above the CNR on the rivers, before trout opener, and telling themselves they're targeting suckers.  Go figure..."
934307,manitoubass2,2015-09-14 17:07:00,11391,"Yeah I dont think anything will come of this other than embarrasment.  Nice to hear from some of the anglers and get their insight.  Imo, even if you clipped the fins and let them fish and weigh them in, and decent lawyer would destroy that as evidence."
934309,moxie,2015-09-14 17:47:00,1566,Aside from the practices mentioned and considering the challenges Ontarios fishery is facing i'd like to see the day all tourneys are banned.  Just a sponsor checkout girl fest.
934314,jimmer,2015-09-14 18:22:00,2730,I would say that it's 99.9% probable that they cheated in all the tournaments this year. Why would they cheat with consistent weights like they had weighed in during the past 3 tournaments.
934316,Steve,2015-09-14 18:41:00,2075,I agree.
934324,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-14 19:25:00,4399,What Moxie said would suit me just fine!!!
934327,Steve,2015-09-14 19:41:00,2075,"most would agree, but there are die hard fisherman that need competition (and the chance of money) in order to fish....  whether it's bass, walleye, or trout/salmon.  I certainly am not one of them."
934330,LucG,2015-09-14 19:53:00,779,"Aside from the practices mentioned and considering the challenges Ontarios fishery is facing i'd like to see the day all tourneys are banned. Just a sponsor checkout girl fest.  I completely disagree with your statement and find it insulting to those who enjoy tournament angling. Competition is everywhere, live with it.   As for what this topic is really about, its a shame things like this happened, but just like most any competition, there are always some people trying to cheat."
934339,Steve,2015-09-14 21:26:00,2075,"Ok, I'll bite LucG - let's see how you play this.  You find the statement ""insulting"".  What specifically about the statement is ""insulting""?  Only two points were made by Moxie. 1) Ontario's fishery is facing challenges. 2) Just a sponsor checkout girl fest.  Now, Ontario's fishery IS facing challenges.....just look at the lakes that are getting pounded by bass tournaments every weekend...I'll use Muskrat Lake as a prime example. Tournaments every weekend from opener to October, and not a single bass gets restocked in the lake....just stuck, toured around the lake, some die, then released.  Now, number 2, even you have to admit it. Someone gets a free pack of senko's and as a result is willing to SELL his soul out for more tackle. I'd wager 90% (screw it, 95%) of tournament anglers who wear SPONSOR clothing aren't getting paid a dime for wearing the logo's. Being a ""pro staff"" angler in Ontario does not mean a ""professional angler"" rather, a ""promotional angler"".  Cronzy said it best....tournament fisherman in Ontario look no different than a Nascar driver, lol.  I've never agreed with anything Moxie has ever written on this board.....but I can't see how what he said was ""insulting"".  In fact, I'd say it was rather accurate.     edit: didn't know w.h.o.r.e would be auto corrected to ""checkout girl"", lol."
934358,lunkerbasshunter,2015-09-14 22:52:00,2585,I love competition when fishing.  A little side bet here and there but when tourneys get into the thousands of dollars then I think you bring out the cheaters and scammers.  Keep it small and fun and you would eliminate this kind of thing I would think?

Of course another competing angler could have framed them but that would involve them placing the fish there to frame them, which is crazy risky because if they were seen it would make them look like a Cheater. What is the most likely scenario."
934256,beertech,2015-09-14 12:43:00,118,Things look obvious but all im saying is whoever put them there  could have been caught red handed.   The tournament organizer owes it to everyone who got payed their entry fees to catch and convict.  not just ask them.

934204,glen,2015-09-14 01:46:00,2641,"""Lots of proof in other peoples shares of that of identical fish being held up at the end of the day (weigh in) on different lakes too.""  I'd like to see the pics.  Lol."
934205,manitoubass2,2015-09-14 01:48:00,11391,"Yeah, true.  But youde think youde know WHERE to place your eyes after numerous complaints/picture evidence"
934206,OhioFisherman,2015-09-14 01:49:00,6623,"No clue, it doesn't seem like it was handled properly to me? Years ago at a tournament at an area lake two guys pre fishing snagged a piece of wood with a line attached. At the end of the line was a live bag with a limit of good sized bass in it.  They clipped the fins on the bass slightly, lowered the bag back down and reported it to the tournament director. The next day, day of the tournament, the would be winners tried to weigh in fish with their fins clipped.  Both were locals that lived on the lake and had won there before and rarely did well elsewhere. They got booted and never showed again.  In this day of cell phone cameras? A bit more concrete evidence? Anyone can make an accusation? Or plant alleged evidence?"
934207,Dutch,2015-09-14 01:49:00,831,"Read the FB post above, but cant see any of the other posts about it.  Any other evidence?"
934208,Dutch,2015-09-14 01:54:00,831,How can the same fish be held up at different tournies?  Dont they go back in the release boat?  Wouldnt they have to catch and transport the bass to multiple lakes?

934215,GBW,2015-09-14 02:14:00,8460,I'm not part of the 'event' to say I have seen it with my own eyes but there are so many involved in this Top BASS club I respect and know that I take it as a valid situation. More so when the 2 'guys' run and turn tail not to return after being confronted. Sign of guilt maybe when you have nothing to say after being accused?
