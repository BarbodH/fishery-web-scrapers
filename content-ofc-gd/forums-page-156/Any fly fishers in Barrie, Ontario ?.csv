I have spots I can share, but have others that I am sworrn to never tell. Come fall, it,s pin time. Maybe we can share the pin and fly fall fishing. I havent figured out the fall fly thing yet.  Welcome to BARRIE."
933122,BillM,2015-09-08 02:50:00,17367,To be honest I usually do all of my fly fishing well outside of Barrie.  Grey/Bruce is probably my fav place (besides the upper Credit)
