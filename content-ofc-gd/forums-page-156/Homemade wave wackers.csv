Guys got 16 sheets for sale.... So I was gunna make a few sets for me and my dad...  I know an aluminium guy to maybe make brackets...  And dad thinks he may have access to a hydraulic press to bend it...  Seams simple enough...  And cost would be next to nothing compared to the comercial guys... Biggest expense would be the aluminium brackets...  Let me what you know and pics are very welcome...  Mike"

Mike  yes I have  and I assume you are talking about splash guards installed on the transom to stop waves from coming in when backtrolling?"
935078,misfish,2015-09-18 20:16:00,29133,"15 bucks for a sheet of Lexan??????? Im not doughting you, but that sure is cheap. Are the sheets still covered with the thin film ? Dose it say lexan?  Lexan is pretty flexable as plex glass is stiff. Make sure your getting what you are told.   As for making them, they look pretty straight forward to make. Using lexan, you can bend it on a break press. Thats another nice thing about using it."
935080,jimmer,2015-09-18 20:18:00,2730,I think about making something like that every year. Sounds like a great price if it's the right stuff.
935140,mike rousseau,2015-09-18 23:52:00,4661,Yup  Still has the lexan protective film...  I think we are gunna buy everything he has and resell...
935141,mike rousseau,2015-09-18 23:53:00,4661,Yes...  Me very fall I wish I had them....  This seams like a great deal to get some cheap
935145,porkpie,2015-09-19 00:24:00,2521,That is a great deal.  Do it!!!  Wave wackers retail for $300 or so starting.  Huge savings and shouldn't be hard to do.
