As to the OP's head scratching as to where the hitch is... sounds like Dodge has followed GM's farce of a ""trailering package"". A blue wire.. and an orange wire run thru the frame for you to hook up and a tranny cooler, nothing else.

I have had it plugged in (has a built in block heater).  But a couple of times I did forget - so it sat overnight at -15 or so - started up first try.  Generates heat pretty quick (for a diesel).  When I plug it in, it is even better.  With the -20, I still had heat in a couple of minutes of driving.  So far I have no concerns about cold starting."

However I did get with the Hitch, and Trailer brake.  One thing I really like is the built in plugs for the trailer - in particular where RAM put them.  They are on top of the bumper, unlike most that put them down by where the Hitch is.  I can see these plug ins lasting a long time, as they are actually somewhat protected by where they are located.

To see what I am talking about see this link  http://www.homedepot.com/b/Electrical-Electrical-Tools-Accessories-Electrical-Test-Meters/Infrared-Thermometer/N-5yc1vZboffZ1z1180y  The idea behind it is not so much to see what a temperature of each wheel or brake is since it changes with speed and temperature but to see if the other wheel on the opposite side is within 15% of the other side. That means the front left VS front right , rear L and R and trailer L and R. By reading the caliper thru the wheel openings you can spot a dragging brake pad. By reading the tire sidewall it will give you an indication if it is over heating from something as minor a a low pressure condition. Usually I also shot the hub of the trailer it will tell you if a bearing is seizing up. To check all 6 tires 2 hubs and 4 rotors is less than a minute with this tool. While I do not do this most of the time I drive I try to check the vehicles once or twice a month and so far it has helped spot a hung caliper and a dry set of bearings from a blown seal. Both would have been survivable on a road failure but when I am up North and heading into cottage country it can take a day or so to get the parts to fix. It is why I pack my bearings yearly and replace my tires on the trailer every three years no matter what the tread left is.   Art"

I have owned Gas,Diesel,Turbo,Supercharged, 4x4, 2x4, 2 and 4 stroke over the years. All of them have had shining points and all have a bad side no matter who makes the vehicle. I have built motors that have been turbo, and supercharged  and some have had their horse power doubled or better. With this said I prefer turbo engines both fuels work excellently and when driven correctly can get better mileage than non turbo engines. Gearing is another thing most people overlook, you can take a one horsepower engine and with gears move 1000 lbs not fast but it can be done. Maintenance is also very important to keep things working smoothly it will make any mechanical item work correctly and last longer. When I buy a vehicle I order it with lower gear sets and tow package for the cooling and the heavy up of key components to make it's work load easier to handle.

891605,aplumma,2015-01-11 13:38:00,6896,I actually own both an in line5 Mercedes as well as the eco boost F150. Both are very good vehicles and both have been stellar in durability and reliability. The offset of the additional cost as well as the cost of diesel fuel down here .90cents a gallon makes diesel less attractive. As far as the eco boost you can love them or you can hate them it will not change the way Ford is heading and if the eco boost technology is not for you then you have quite a few other options to chose from.  It is kind of funny how different Mechanics in different areas have a favorite Brand and Engine. One garage I repair their plumbing at cringe when a Toyota comes in but everyone fights to work on the Honda. The mechanic that works on the Mercedes HATES the vehicle not because of the engine but because of the difficulty of getting parts in a timely manner.  Art
891626,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-11 17:10:00,8243,"I have been destroying vehicles since I was 14. Have owned everything from Audi and Alfa to a 240Z and Zephyr. From micro cars, MGB, Triumph, Coopers to Caddy land barges and everything in between. Almost every brand truck manufactured including International Harvester and Range Rover. Each have their pluses and minuses. They say they don't make things the way they used to, thank goodness because the vehicles today are so much better engineered to last than then. I know I might get flack for this statement but I still say if you got to 100,000 miles in the 70's the body was most often rotten along with the frame where we lived.  It's an argument we have regularly in the back yard garage. For reliability I'll take my wifes 3.5 liter close to 300 horse Altima with 350,000 kms over any car I had for everyday reliability. Sure not sexy, fast, actually it's scary fast, and can't take a corners apex like my Alfetta but has taken nothing more than regular maintenance. But then again she drives it not me."
891653,ecmilley,2015-01-11 20:11:00,2163,Well art up  here anyway the eco boost isnt returning the fuel mileage as expected and longevity of the turbos is a problem other than that its a f150. All trucks will work and all trucks have an Achilles heel  being there is plethora of choice to build a truck that suits  you. I work pretty much on everything and dont really see one sticking out as the clear leader
891657,aplumma,2015-01-11 20:55:00,6896,"I am torn on the mileage thing see while Ford statements of the MPG of the motor was exaggerated it is hard to blame it all on Ford. The MPG on a turbo can fluctuate quite a bit driver to driver and even to ambient temperature. If you buy a pickup to get good gas mileage then you need a truck/engine that is small displacement and tall gears. If you buy a truck to tow with then you need a big engine and shorter gearing which means less MPG. The EcoBoost is an attempt to meet the demands of both classes by basically making a variable displacement engine from the 3.5 to a 5.0 (14 lb Boost) engine. To me it is more important to fit the ""tool"" to the job meaning I tow heavy boats long distances and  the trade off of having the ability to start run and stop with authority costs me more in fuel when I am not towing. People need to take these things into account when they critic a vehicle if someone complains that a truck gets poor fuel mileage but does not tell you it has a tow package with 3.73 gears they their comment has no validity. EC  as a mechanic I value your input because it is based on what you have seen and had your hands on so your comments are supported by facts. The people I depend on to repair my vehicles when it is past my understanding/ tool availability have been very happy with what a well maintained Eco Boost engine and drive train runs like. I still feel no matter who makes your vehicle if you maintain it you will get a good and happy life from it. If you only make repairs you will never find a vehicle that makes you happy.   Art"

It warms up very quickly and seems warm faster than the F150 did.  I've only gone 200km so far and sat idling for long periods trying to figure out all the toys so it's kind of premature to judge fuel economy but it's averaged 10.1L/100km since I picked it up.  I drove from Waterford to Hamilton today and it seems like it gets between 8.0 and 9.0 or so on the two lane highways but we'll see over time.  It is a nice riding truck and has lots of nice features but it will take a bit of getting used to after 20+ years of Fords.

When I want my V8 and it's 300 HP merging onto the 403 while towing a ton of boat I want it and I want it now and I don't care what it costs if I can avoid a collision with a wanna be SUV with a 6 cylinder diesel or gas sewing machine. I'll pay the extra penny or so a mile for my V8.  Wow 1 zip Canada, 23 seconds in. Well not pointing fingers, but merging is an art and there's a lot of eraser drivers out there."

890534,Raf,2015-01-06 01:38:00,3495,maybe but you gotta rev the snot out of that sowing machine.  the previous gen gc diesel was quicker up to about 35 mph out of the hole than the v8.  then the v8 took over.
890536,Raf,2015-01-06 01:47:00,3495,straying off topic but v6 turbos are more than capable vs their v8 counterparts in the drag race game. remember the 80s grand national?  it ran the 1/4 mile quicker than v8s of that time.  cubes are nice but there's more than one way to make power.

890601,scugpg,2015-01-06 11:59:00,1373,From test driving both versions of the Jeep I can't disagree either but it's not night and day. However the diesel feels more powerful in everyday driving due to the 400lbft of torque at low rpms. Hemi is faster if you tromp on it but imagine it gets really thirsty.  Isn't the 0-60 times only about a second apart?
890603,manitoubass2,2015-01-06 12:15:00,11391,"Wow, doods take this very seriously!  Carry on, I think I'm learning something???  ???"
890614,hutch4113,2015-01-06 13:00:00,374,"The Hemi is faster - no question.  I test drove both before I bought.  But it is really difficult to compare the 2, as the feel is different.  The diesel feels like an unstoppable force, particularly when you catch it right.  The Hemi is a beast.  For that matter the Ecoboost is blast to drive to.  The only thing that would make the Diesel better is a few more HP.  Like the way it was described to me - Torque = Power -> HP = how fast the power is generated.  If the Diesel had maybe 15 to 20 more HP ---- whoo baby.  But I think the main point now - is at least there is an option, which did not exist before.  It is high time it was done - and all things being equal, RAM did an excellent job - in the short term at least.  Time will tell......"
890655,aplumma,2015-01-06 15:28:00,6896,"Art, I have an old 04 Cummins and regularly get 11 -12 L/100km, that's with a truck that probably weights over a 100 more than yours.  You claim to get 16.8 L/100km with a 6000lb trailer at 65-85 mpg?  One of my sons has a '13 Ecoguzzle, towing a 17' all aluminum enclosed trailer with 2 snowmobiles, we averaged between 22-28L/100km at no more than 70mph. The big difference is that I am pulling a custom covered bassboat and a covered bed so my wind resistance is a lot less. On my meter it shows 14 MPG if my googled converter is correct .

890225,Raf,2015-01-04 20:40:00,3495,"I don't see why not, they are both oil based and fluctuate with the price per barrell.  Diesel demand fluctuates seasonally due to it also being used as heating oil.  The links you provided illustrate the gaps summer vs winter."
890229,aplumma,2015-01-04 21:01:00,6896,Historically diesel was cheaper for many years here. The new sulfur content marked the change over to more $ for diesel. It is not that the process warrants the price it is just because they can. Most of the oil companies profits are made on diesel and heating oil due to the laws of economics and the gas crowd makes more noise than the diesel consumers. With the introduction of the Eco Boost and other more efficent gas engines it makes the US move even further from being major diesel consumers.   Art

890266,Joeytier,2015-01-04 21:55:00,3990,2013.  I average between 14.5-16 l/100
890297,Fisherman,2015-01-04 22:51:00,7201,"The only time an Ecoboost will get rated mileage is when the box is empty, put any weight or a cargo trailer behind it and it can't pass a gas station."

I had a cop at a ride check call me a .... ...... after sticking his head in and reading my 5.0 coyote fuel read out that was sitting at 11.8 l / 100 km when he stopped me,  as his ecobust (as he called it) was going through 18+ / 100 km.  Since then, now 2 years, mine has crept up to using about 13 / 100 km on average highway city. Highway only is still about 11.9.. pulling the 2150 Lund Leah keeps it below 16 l / 100 km. I can't do it.. but she always seems to."
890381,hutch4113,2015-01-05 13:39:00,374,"The thing with a boosted vehicle is the power is great - but it comes at a price.  I traded in a Car that was a turbo - when I just cruised it had great mileage - but what is the fun in that?  If I had the Ecoboost Truck - I know my mileage would suck, because of the way I drive.  In Truth - there really is no ""Eco"" in the Boost - unless driving style is changed.  Even the Diesel does not get the best mileage if it is driven aggressively.  Case in point - the Truck I am driving now, gets about the same mileage as the Car I traded in, when comparing only City driving.  It may have something to do with my acceleration from stop lights....  ."
890386,Terry,2015-01-05 14:05:00,14456,Exactly and the one I looked at used premium gas on top of poor mileage. So diesel won two fold

The milage drops to 15.5 l per 100 while towing a 17' bassboat.  Lately with the sub zero temps it is difficult to stay below 12l The only milage surprise I have found is that accelerating very slowly in city driving actually uses more fuel.  It is best to accelerate about the same rate as average car drivers do, then let off as you approach the speed limit.

Just kidding barrysts; I couldn't resist!  My last 2 F-150's both had 5.4 Tritons  and neither could do better than 15.0 L/100km when babied and were over 20 L/100km towing my 18' boat.  They didn't however use much fuel when they were in for repairs which was a good thing because they were there often; thank god for extended warranties.  I have driven 8 Ford trucks over the last 20 years and couldn't have been happier but the last two are the end for me so I bought the new Laramie diesel.  Hopefully I'm not disappointed......  time will tell.  Also, when I traded in the F-150 the Dodge dude told me they would not accept it on trade if it had the Ecoboost; not sure why exactly but that's what I was told."
890425,KLINKER,2015-01-05 18:24:00,256,"Ecoboost truck engines had a bad habit of blowing up,  if you search them you will find a guy in Alberta whent through 3 or 4 of them ."
890433,aplumma,2015-01-05 19:09:00,6896,Wayne I am getting 13.8L per 100 kilometers mpg combined and 13L per 100 kilometers highway. The towing of 6000 lbs gets me 16.8L per kilometer mpg when I run to Canada but remember we are doing 65-85 mph all the way. I am very happy with the Eco Boost and so far have had 0 issues with it. For the people who say they blow up or have issues usually it is the way they are driven rather than the engine having a design flaw. All companies have an off day on the build but so far Ford has always stood behind any of their products and made things right for me at least. Premium gas is not needed if you are driving it normally so it is not an additional expense that I have. I also have a 3.72 gearset instead of the normal 3.31 so I run 500 rpms more at highway speeds than the stock units. I have a new Transit van coming in the next few weeks so I will be the owner of 2 Eco Boosts now. I am for the most part a Ford man rather than a Dodge person because I have over the years made friends with the auto shop and the dealer so I get treated better than average. Once you decide to spend 40-50 thousand on a vehicle for towing the cost of fuel really does not make or break the deal of getting it. I have motorcycles that can burn up to  10 l per 100 kilometers and a few boats that get between 1.5 and 3 MPG so to grump about my truck would be foolish lol.   Art

Anyhow, fact is they are all too expensive and they all break.  So far the Ford eco boost engine has been worth its weight in gold for me. The pick up has towed and preformed excellently with runs up to 14 hours straight towing a boat and a weeks worth of gear.. The gas millage has been on average 17 MPG with a tow package and geared for towing at 3.72. The upgrade from the 3.7 to the eco boost is $1800.oo on average and was the first upgrade I did when I ordered my new van. While I like diesels and have owned/own them in the past the surcharge on fuel makes Gas a better choice. The 17MPG VS 22MPG is negated by the .70 cents average over charge on the diesel.  Art"
890168,hutch4113,2015-01-04 15:10:00,374,"The oil change on the Diesel is expensive (Truck).  It is about $200 or so, due to the amount of Oil - and it is a particular Synthetic (if you are handy, you can do it yourself for 60 to 80.00).  However the Oil change is 16000K, or roughly twice a year depending on how you drive, KM's, etc.  There is also DEF - but that is a requirement for all Diesel vehicles.  That works out to about $20 a year.  At any rate - if you tow - really anything on a regular basis the Diesel wins hands down - against all engines (until you hit the payload limit on the Truck that is.... ).  I've seen almost 20MPG towing which is awesome.  I like Diesel - so the price point for me was not that big of a deal.  The premium when I bought was also not as big.  I knew Diesel would be more expensive in the Winter - but cheaper in the Summer (tracking it - it was almost a 6 month split, so it is a wash in my mind).  My break even point from fuel savings over the Hemi came out to about 4 years (ran some numbers, based on my driving patterns, KM's, etc. before I purchased).  We just did a drive from Kingston to Santee SC in my Truck.  3 Guys, full load in the tailgate.  We averaged 27MPG or so - with a pretty heavy foot (mileage drops - pretty much for all vehicles once you go over 100K/hr) - I would say we probably did between 120 -> 135KM/h most of the way.  The compliments I got on the vehicle were great - to a tee they thought it was the most comfortable vehicle (not just truck) they had been in, and that it was a great long distance cruiser.  No regrets from me on the purchase."
890181,Raf,2015-01-04 16:35:00,3495,"while it applies to you Art, that surcharge does not apply to 99% of the members here.  gas vs diesel over a 12 month period is about a wash for us canadians -- they are the same price with diesel being more than gas in the winter and the opposite in summer.  the us market gets screwed and the arguement for diesel is a little harder in the states."

It's got a lot more with it being a half tonne chassis then it does the engine.  Also, if you are pulling a trailer with that much weight, you're buying a Duramax, Cummins, Powerstroke..  Not a 1500 series truck. I used the word ""carry"" but, I properly should have used the word Payload.  I agree that I would rarely ever be pulling that much.  Thats why I was referring to payload capacity.  RAM 1500 Laramie, V6 Diesel, Quad, auto, 6.4, 4x4 gives a payload of 1,076 lbs.  Towing of 8,000.  Two guys, an ATV in the bed and you are already near Max.  Thats before your gear or any tongue weight. Apparently, some hunters could easily be dinged.  Some other model Diesels with same specs had a max payload of close to 1,400 lbs and a towing of 7,800lbs.

It is exactly half of what was being used before. BUT, the difference is the RAM equally outfitted cost 10k more. Now we pay fleet for our trucks so the numbers are a little different, but the idea is the same. So in the lifetime of the truck with me as a driver, It would only break even on cost after 250,000km. Similar to the Eco-boost, when they first came out. It seams it is strictly a pay now or pay later scenario. Considering that we will probably deal this one at 150... it would have never paid off.  Of course fuel consumption is different for everyone and every vehicle, you mileage may vary. Although I really enjoy my new(to me) f150, I was really excited to try the ram with the baby diesel.

876615,hutch4113,2014-10-14 12:51:00,374,"I know some have asked about the mileage I have been getting, so thought I would post an update.  Did my annual drive to visit family. They are 4 hours away - KM showed 956KM round trip - Barrie to Manitoulin (Little Current). In the past we have taken our SUV (Hyundai Veracruz) which get's pretty good mileage. Generally speaking when we took the SUV it was one fillup to get there, one fillup to get home, and then one more once we were home. It was usually around $80.00 per tank - so * 3 -> $240.00.We took the truck because - well because I wanted to. Filled up as we were leaving from just over 1/4 - > came in at $84.00. Drove there and back on one tank (still stoked about that), and filled up at home for 101.00. So that comes in at 185.00, driving a bigger/heavier vehicle, or a savings of $55.00. Driving style was the same (I am pretty much a lead foot). Fuelly tells me 27 mpg."
876621,BillM,2014-10-14 13:29:00,17367,Can't complain about that!
876623,misfish,2014-10-14 13:36:00,29133,"You still have a full tank to empty,so really it cost you the 85 or so buxs for the round trip.  Dang, that's nice.  Im loving the mileage Im getting from the new truck. I have put in 85 bux so far and have just reach the 800 km mark. That's darn good in my books."
876924,Wagoneer,2014-10-16 08:21:00,118,"I sure hope manufacturers start giving us the diesel options that other countries have been getting for years. 27mpg in a light duty truck is awesome, especially if you weren't being careful. If I can get about 31mpg with my 4cyl 2.0L gas engine in my lifted suzuki SX4 with big A/T's, imagine what I could get with the 2.0L turbo diesel that's available everywhere else in the world. The mileage wouldn't even be the best part, the heaps of usable torque would be greatly welcomed! Wringing out the gasser to get anything out of it gets old sometimes. I love dropping gears with the 6spd, but it would be nice to once be able to just keep it in 6th and be able to climb a hill on the highway.  How's the tranny with that engine on the highway? I hear it loves to stick in top gear and takes a lot of throttle input to downshift."

I hear it loves to stick in top gear and takes a lot of throttle input to downshift.    It is in a word - Awesome.  The transmission is the main reason the setup works to well.  It does not need to downshift for the most part - just push the pedal down and it accelerates - different from a Gasser - more like a freight train (unstoppable...lol).  It has more than enough passing power.  It is neat to be doing 120, and have the RPM's sitting at 1900...."

In about 35 years of driving diesel here, I've never had to change a filter because of clogging, waxing or water contamination.  Heard some horror stories further south."

877209,Sharkbait22,2014-10-18 15:50:00,297,"I have an interest in a new vehicle so I'm interested in this post. I've been holding out to see if Toyota makes any changes in their Tacoma or 4runners, but this Ram has my attention too.  I've been reading a bit and found a comment from someone that seems to know some things aside from the sometimes higher maintenance costs and purchase price for a diesel.  ""The current European ""Euro 5"" standards for emissions are not as strict as those now in the force in the U.S. That means that all makers of diesel vehicles sold elsewhere in the world have to incur considerable time and effort, not to mention expense, modifying their vehicles to meet tougher North American standards. Given the small size of the passenger diesel market here--which has historically been limited to German imports and heavy-duty trucks--most makers weren't willing to make that investment. Moreover, diesel fuel is tax-advantaged in many European markets, so not only were the cars more fuel-efficient, the fuel was cheaper too. That and the high cost of fuel in general largely offset the greater cost of a diesel vehicle against the gasoline equivalent. In the States, however, fuel is cheap in general, diesel fuel is usually MORE expensive than gasoline, and diesel engines remain more expensive than to build than gasoline engines. That all made the business case for selling the cars here much harder. However, when ""Euro 6"" rules arrive starting in 2015, European diesels will be essentially as clean as what's required for legal sale in the U.S. (All but Mazda will go to urea injection for the exhaust aftertreatment.) That considerably reduces the cost for any maker that sells diesels in Europe to certify them for the States."""

Tier II Bin 5 emission regs are tough to meet compared to the current Euro 5 standard.  Like you said however, once those vehicles are required to meet Euro 6, it should make meeting the current North American standards extremely easy.  Mazda would also be the last company I'd be buying a diesel from, you should read up on the debacle that CX-7 owners had to deal with in Australia with their new engines, lol.

877220,Raf,2014-10-18 16:36:00,3495,I'm not sure I see significantly higher maintenance and definately no higher fuel cost of a diesel compared to gas?  From Apr-Nov diesel is 1-4 cents / litre cheaper than gas where I am.. and 1-4 cents higher in the winter months. Lets call it even.  The oil change runs 150-200 at the dealer - ~100-120 if you did it yourself (10 quarts of fancy stuff)  but the change interval is 10000 miles (16000 kms).  Glow plugs can go.. as can spark plugs.  Fuel filter is supposed to be changed out a little more often on a diesel than a gasser.  The new diesel require the urea be refilled which is pretty cheap.  Everything else pretty much equal?
877221,BillM,2014-10-18 16:42:00,17367,"Raf, don't forget resale, longevity and mileage, lol.   If you have a drive that suits a diesel (ie  a lot of highway miles) you're silly not to consider one."
