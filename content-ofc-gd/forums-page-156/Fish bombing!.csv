935949,BillM,2015-09-23 00:56:00,17367,Those lakes look like awful trout habitat.
935951,irishfield,2015-09-23 01:03:00,26272,"Why Bill... I thought I was riding along into my Temagami Brookie lakes with the guy. Same shapes, shorelines etc.  We now have comments going on two identical threads though..."
935953,BillM,2015-09-23 01:11:00,17367,"Looks muddy, shallow and warm.  Unless the Forty Creek has taken over my eye sight tonight  :)"
935957,irishfield,2015-09-23 01:15:00,26272,"There was a couple weed ringed ""ponds"" that were off, but the long narrow zig zaggy lakes are usually deep folds in the rock. That said, we always catch the brookies in less than 5 feet of water when ice fishing and I don't think the main lake we fish is very deep in the middle."

936579,mike rousseau,2015-09-26 01:02:00,4661,I don't understand...  Why not land then release the fish?  I would think a fair amount are injured or killed like this...

The more take-offs and landings you do, the more you increase the chance of something going wrong. Better to risk a few fish than an aircraft and crew. It also would take a lot more time. There's also the possibility that some of those waterbodies would be too small to land or take-off."
