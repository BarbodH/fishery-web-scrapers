934941,Sinker,2015-09-18 00:40:00,8692,"This will never stop. People who have never seen fish that big before just cant resist the urge totry and catch one. Its human nature. I was down by the dam today, and the amout of people there that had no idea about the fish was mind blowing. They just dont know any better, and no enforcement doesnt help. The chances of seeing a CO down there is so slim that these guys can get away with anything.   Closing the season from sept 1st to Nov 1 st is a great solution, and makes the most sense. Like Steve says, why is it even allowed....it makes no sense.  Just imagine the carnage if the walleye season was open during the spawn!! Its rediculous to even have an open season while these fish ate trying to spawn.  And the guys who are saying there are no wild fish......right. More ignorance. The ganny is damb close to 100% wild fish. All species. When the fins were clipped, you would be hard pressed to get one out of the ganny. They are wild. Leave them alone!!  Dont get me started on atlantics. Ive caught one in ontario, and it came in like a bag of water.   S."

People who are turned away from fishing Ganny will only pressure and leave even more garbage/rotting fish corpses in surrounding tribs.  It's really unfortunate that people don't know any better...it's common sense and common decency to not litter or poach.

I will be copy and pasting your thoughts to give to the mayor and council they are at wits end and do not know where to go next they like the idea of people coming to port hope and breaking even or even costing a little but what has been happening the last few years is costing the town lots . ( two pick up trucks full of carcass from the FREE fish cleaning station in one day )  The enforcement that we had appeared to be a gimmick from talking to people he picked the ones he wanted to check .. he checked 2 people then walked by 4 people of certain decent then chose a white person with a pin reel with a 14 rod for his licence then walked by 7 other people of a certain decent then asked another white guy for his licence then called the town thursday morning and said he was down at the river early evening and seen no violations and every one checked had a fishing license .

Yep....on the banks...but they continue to serve a purpose of feeding the wildlife along the banks and fertilize the vegetation...the circle of life ....get the weekend warriors and bo Bo's under control and enjoy the Chinooks for what they are ...a put and take industry generating money for those fortunate enough to have a stream or River readily available....my 02

The stocking target for Chinook on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario was recently increase from 540,000 to 600,000 per year; I think the U.S. stocks about three times that many.  Many of the rivers, such as Credit, Highland, Don, Bronte, are stocked with Chinook each year.  So the north shore is not entirely wild Chinook.  There are also steelhead stocked on the north shore.  The Credit and Rouge rivers are both stocked with steelhead.  Other rivers, such as the Ganny, have self sustaining populations.  Brown trout are stocked all along the northern lake shore.  The MNR is reviewing the stocking program for browns and are considering concentrating the stocking into fewer locations.

I  hope the Hope  can make it happen and other municipalities follow suit .

Passing new rules to limit this annual travesty will be a great step forward, It will be enforcing it that will be the challenge. The poachers wont care about getting up at 3:00 am to do the desecration. Will the by law officers be there ? And will the punishment be enough to make it hurt?

On a side note though, I think I need a history lesson on the issue with the salmon. Can someone enlighten me on this?  I read this years ago so some info I may get crossed, but beside over fishing & environment changes in the river systems alewives which were always native to lake Ontario by the way of the St. Lawrence river began to explode in the lake which had very detrimental effects on the Lake Trout populations & when the canal system was put in place they spread like wildfire to the other lakes, specifically Lake Huron & Michigan. Can't remember the man's name but was a world class fisherman from Michigan that saw a opportunity to introduce Salmon to the lake. After a few years of getting approvals he stocked Coho smolts into Beer creek & another river that escapes me right now(around the mid 60's). These fish gorged themselves on the overabundant alewives creating the world class fishery he envisioned, which was his only goal.  Now with the ever dwindling alewives population the lake trout & walleye populations have rebounded big time in those lakes which to most lake fisherman ""once the salmon are gone I'm selling my stuff"" is a common response I hear.

Through a municipal license scheme or It shut it down completely (barricades)  Either way this cannot continue as is.....  I say let the municipality charge a per day fee to fish, upon proof of a valid fishing card. All regulations from the province are to be enforced. Pay an off duty enforcement officer from the fees raised. Use the remainder to pay for the port-o-potties, enhancements, trash collection etc....  This will drive away the unsavoury, knowing that one, they have to pay..... Two they have to show proof of a license... And three there will be 24/7 enforcement.

Personally I haven't used. roe or any live bait for steelhead in well over 25 years. I do very well in most outings. Good fishermen adapt and still manage to catch fish. Time to make very difficult for the pigs to get away with the carnage they feel they have all rights to. Time for some real stiff fines for snagging, poaching and over limit fishing too.   100% agree, I love fishing the Ganny, but I avoid it like the plague in the fall just cause of the Bull, I haven't used roe or live bait for that matter for steel head or salmon for 5 years myself, have gone over to fly fishing for them instead"

934756,Steve,2015-09-17 00:30:00,2075,"yep. that way we can all catch lakers and atlantics....just the way it was intended.  LoL (again )     I fish for every single species of fresh water fish in Ontario (except carp) and nothing beats the excitement of spring kings.....you can get them from shore, a kayak, or even waders walking the shorelines....no need for a big fancy boat....  Have a 20lbs fresh spring king peel 400' of line off in one run....or spool ya if your using an undersized spinning reel....far from dead kings in rivers...  Just close the rivers down until November....the loogans will be gone, then the river will be ready for the hard core trout guys...."

Can someone enlighten me on this?  the issues are people snagging, fishing illegally for them, ie bare hooks, people with rope and 3 giant trebles on it, the gutting of the fish on shore, discarding the carcass in the bushes to rot, the shear volume of garbage left behind by these people, the disregard of any and all fishing regulations, including bag limits.  The town has been on the fence about allowing people to fish on town property for quite some time, and its always been to good fisherman that have swayed them back, this time, this year, they have had it, they are tired of the smell of premature rotting corpses, they even went the extra mile this year and provided multiple porta potties for the fisherman to use to along the river, only to have them used as a garbage disposal for fish heads, the number of ppeople that show up to 'fish' the run, is downright stupid"

NY still stocks their rivers, but we don't get very many NY fish here in our rivers.  anyone that wants to read about the lake ontario history, heres a great read  http://probeinternational.org/library/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0824_001.pdf"

G  since the river is town property, all they have to do is put up no trespassing signs along the shores, but they've been reluctant to do so in the past years, now, i think thats one of many things they are going to do.
