One word Raf AWESOME. The pad on the 89 ranger was what I fell in love with and why I rebuilt it instead of buying a new one. This was the last year before they changed to a different design and it feels rock solid. The weight of the older boats makes for a solid ride with out flexing when you hit a wake and keeps the pad from rocking on and off when passing thru a wake.  Art

935020,Bernie,2015-09-18 15:45:00,3190,Made a world of difference in the performance. The previous model year of my boat the complaint was that that it porpoises too easily. So the next model year they actually put a slight hook in the hull to make it run flatter. Trouble was it overdid it and it wouldn't come up. So I had heard the Viper prop would help and put it on. I can actually get it to porpoise without blowing out. Gained 5mph. Nothing but good things to say about it.
