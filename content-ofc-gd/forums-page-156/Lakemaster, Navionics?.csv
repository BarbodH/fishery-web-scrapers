935447,DaveRoach,2015-09-20 20:30:00,202,I've just purchased a Hummingbird 899 SI HD Combo and was wondering what card would be best with this unit. I will be using it for Ontario lakes. Lakemaster? Navionics?  Thanks in advance for any thoughts or suggestions.  Dave
935478,landry,2015-09-20 22:53:00,1005,I have the navionics. Great detail on inland lakes like Kawarthas... Not so detailed on St clAir and Erie.
