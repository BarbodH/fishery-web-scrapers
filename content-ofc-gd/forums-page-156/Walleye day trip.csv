934708,Joeytier,2015-09-16 21:59:00,3990,"Been trying to force myself to take more pictures of my backlake escapades.  No photographers in my group of buddies so bear with my cellphone pics.Spent the day on a back lake about 65 kms from town on the Kip river watershed on Monday.  We ended up going in baitless which is never a good idea this time of year but we made it work and ended up locating some active fish.  I was still sort of expecting fish to be spread out in their summer haunts, but this was definitely not the case as almost every fish we caught (and even marked) were in one exact spot.  Not surprisingly, this was the mouth of the main inflow into the lake...33-37 FOW.  I should've snapped a picture of the graph because they were stacked up like nothing I've ever seen before.  I know we would've boated far more fish with worms or leeches, but we still boated somewhere between 15-20 walleyes using split tail minnows (Gulp and Impulse minnows mostly), and we missed both the dusk and dawn bites so I'm happy anyways.Had a few KMs of this to get to our destination lake, even had a brand new beaver dam to contend with...Doubled up on 14""ers...The lone big boy of the trip (20.5"")Not bad for a few hours on a brand new lake!"

934721,davey buoy,2015-09-16 22:25:00,5505,"Looks like fun!!!,"
934823,Rod Caster,2015-09-17 12:53:00,5784,Cool. One of a million new lakes and waterways for you to explore up there.
934834,mike rousseau,2015-09-17 13:47:00,4661,Looks like a fish fry to me...  I know this will sound weird but I'm jealous... I have a hard time catching small tasty walleye like that... I can find them spring and fall but not in the summer...  Looks like a beautiful lake too
934871,mr blizzard,2015-09-17 17:26:00,1589,"Well done , looks like a gorgeous spot"
934883,Cast-Away,2015-09-17 18:42:00,790,That is awesome that you can go to a place so close to where you live and looking so uninhabited to boot!
934908,spincast,2015-09-17 21:53:00,3279,beauty spot. great day on the water.
934911,ckewley,2015-09-17 22:11:00,699,Awesome stuff man!
934959,sleepjigging,2015-09-18 03:26:00,207,cool
935104,misfish,2015-09-18 21:31:00,29133,"I enjoyed that.  It,s simple fishing with friends."
935108,Joeytier,2015-09-18 22:16:00,3990, I'd rather put more time and effort (and fuel) into getting to a remote spot for a few productive hours than pounding it out on pressured fish any day
935135,limeyangler,2015-09-18 23:22:00,5204,"That's all I do:)  I'd rather put more time and effort (and fuel) into getting to a remote spot for a few productive hours than pounding it out on pressured fish any day You are an inspiration!  Must get into the remote places more often, just need to find someone up for it round here."
935142,MJL,2015-09-19 00:08:00,2427,What a gem of a spot. Just beautiful.  Great looking walleyes too
935147,Joeytier,2015-09-19 00:57:00,3990,"That's usually an issue for me as well.  My day trips are early mornings, no cell reception and very likely I wont see a soul as soon I get off the paved road.  Not for everyone I guess.  I end up going solo fairly often, much to the girlfriends dismay haha"
935326,chris.brock,2015-09-19 23:22:00,4053,"Nice country in your backyard Joey.Too many lakes, not enough time."
