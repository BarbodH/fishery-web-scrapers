If this includes you Southern Ontario guys, I'm sorry to hear about your weather. It has cooled down a lot here in Yuma AZ. too, it was only about 75 here this afternoon. I finally got out fishing with my friend from Dick, from BC. We went to Martineze Lake, which is a flooded backwater of the Colorado River.  Bass Club guys down here have been telling me that shallow running crankbaits are the thing to throw right now, so I picked up a few the other day.  We caught a few fish, 6 or 7 nothing over a pound and a half...and had a very good day on the water.    A stiff breeze in the morning turned into a heavy wind by noon, We tried to stay in the lea of islands etc, but we called it a day around 3PM. I checked my new boat's speed with a GPS...I hit 55mph on the one open place that I knew was safe, and we were still gaining speed when I shut it down...I can't wait to get a nice long run on Jack's or Chandos where I can really wind it out...grin.
