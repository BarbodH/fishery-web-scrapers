137567,dsn,2007-11-28 00:38:00,1018,Yeah around 3pm into 3:30pm a massive snow storm moved into the GTA. With  whiteout conditions. It past me by and was heading towards the city of Toronto. Reports have it that there are blackouts in local areas. The system cleared up at 3:45pm as I watched the sun break through the white fallin snow.  It moved very quick. And did some damage.   dsn

The Brantford man, 45, was still in his kayak when his body was discovered around 9 a.m. near Grimsby, said Hamilton police Acting Staff Sgt. Chris Wills.  Concerned individuals in Fifty Point Park first called police around 3 p.m. Tuesday when the man left shore despite treacherous weather. He was wearing a wetsuit.  A search team, including members of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Hamilton and Niagara police marine units, set off in winds gusting up to 90 km/h and waves three to five metres high, but had no success last night.  “We had to pull our boat back because it was starting to ice up,” Wills said, adding a helicopter from Canadian Forces Base Trenton searched until the early hours of the morning.  Police haven’t yet released the man’s name."
137734,tonyb,2007-11-28 17:46:00,1637,Honestly...what did he think the outcome would be?  Kayaking on Lake O in November with a gale force wind warning in effect...
