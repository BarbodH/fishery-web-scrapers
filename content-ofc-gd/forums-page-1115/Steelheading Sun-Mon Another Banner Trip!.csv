137192,solopaddler,2007-11-26 21:11:00,8605,"After fishing for so many years I'm just not into punishing myself anymore, fact is I just can't stand the cold. Was supposed to fish last Thursday but bailed for obvious reasons, Friday and Saturday were possibilities, but the weather still looked cold... After seeing the weather forecast for Sun/Mon with both days reasonably warm I made a couple of calls. First to my co-worker who was happy to cover for me on Monday, then to my steelheading buddy to see if he was game for an overnighter. He was of course, so the plan was set. Over the course of the last 2 days we put a lot of miles on my Honda and fished a variety of different trib's. Sunday was fun as we caught a mixed bag of Browns and Steelhead. Started out the day though with the breakfast of champions  .    I thought this sign was a hoot!    Some fish...                  Today was interesting....very surprisingly it rained overnight which blew out the river we had it in mind to fish. Fortunately there's always a back up  . We made our way to the estuary of one of my favourite rivers under a leaden sky with light rain falling. No wind to speak of and temps well above zero, just perfect! We found a decent little push of fresh fish, all full of pure evil  , with lots of spunk. We had some epic battles today!                        We did catch a few real booty looking ones, obviously they'd been in the river for awhile. Some though, like this nice buck had just gorgeous colours...      All in all another 2 solid days of fun.  Cheers,  Mike"

Fished locally Sunday at the mouth of a Lake O trib and got skunked...  I wish the ON government would do more for the ailing Lake Ontario migratory fishery.  I live 10 mins from a great tributary, but travel hours just to catch some fish..  Tony"

137329,discophish,2007-11-27 04:47:00,392,Great job!  I love the colours in those fish.  You just may have insipred me to get out on the rivers.  The boat thing just isn't working when ice is covering the lakes up north.

137559,MJL,2007-11-28 00:23:00,2427,"Fantastic report as always.  Each report you post is a dagger to my motivation to do well at university. It's been 67days, 10hrs, 25minutes and 33 seconds since I last drifted for steel...You can probably tell, I'm a little restless for the next report."
137566,fishindevil,2007-11-28 00:38:00,6254,"WOW...Amazing fishing trip & report !!!!!  1 those browns look so nice,and so do those fall steelhead,well done...."

137640,solopaddler,2007-11-28 09:37:00,8605," Hey, glad I can help ease your pain  . It's not looking great weather wise for the foreseeable future though, won't be long before the rivers are all locked up anyway. Don't fret over not being able to fish, just worry about your studies. If I could turn back the clock that's what I'd be doing....  Cheers"
