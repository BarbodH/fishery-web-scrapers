There are days when others would stay home in front of a warm fire and we venture out no matter what the weatherman says, we are adventurers.  We have confidence found in skill, drive, need, and desire to be one with the outdoors.  These are the things that make us human.  Fault aside, our judgement is not always based on safety or forthought, it is based on feeling.  Serge was doing what he loved, what filled his heart and sated his desires... for that I admire him...  For his family and friends I am sad.  May his memory make you smile, his drive give you inspiration and his spirit stay with you always.  Condolences and my heart felt sympathies...  Jen"

138076,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-30 01:04:00,835,"Time to require flares on any vessel in open water. On the east end of LO a group of kayakers got in trouble and the first one to make it to shore burned down a building because he didn't have flares.  Open water kayaking is getting more popular and yet the least visible boat on the water and often operated by the least experienced people is not required to carry flares, makes no sense to me."
137901,discophish,2007-11-29 04:12:00,392,"I'm sorry to hear of such a tragic accident.  I heard about the sad news this morning and felt a sense of familiarity with how it's like to be on rough waters in a kayak.  I paddle white water in a 6 foot playboat, and follow the read of the kayak communities, and there are always tragedies.  We love what we do, and people will remember the passion that Serge kept for himself and others that experience with him.  He enjoyed his life and lived it well, and is honored and highly regarded in many ways."

I didn't know him, but to those that did, take some comfort in the fact that he lived his life the way he wanted to and experienced more in his short life than some will in ten lifetimes."
