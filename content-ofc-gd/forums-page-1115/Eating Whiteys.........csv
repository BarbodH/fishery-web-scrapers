Never eally cared for them until I  learned how to filet and de-bone them and since, I have to admit, I love getting my eat-on. ( I respect the limits....dont worry ).  I was reading on ""another board""...( I know....What am I thinking???) that there is a limit to the amount of Whiteys one should consume out of Simcoe.  Anyone have more info on this ?? Thoughts???
