Kayaker found dead near Grimsby  A kayaker who went missing on Lake Ontario yesterday amid snow squalls and high winds was found dead this morning along the Niagara shoreline.  The Brantford man, 45, was still in his kayak when his body was discovered around 9 a.m. near Grimsby, said Hamilton police Acting Staff Sgt. Chris Wills.  Concerned individuals in Fifty Point Park first called police around 3 p.m. Tuesday when the man left shore despite treacherous weather. He was wearing a wetsuit.  A search team, including members of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Hamilton and Niagara police marine units, set off in winds gusting up to 90 km/h and waves three to five metres high, but had no success last night.  “We had to pull our boat back because it was starting to ice up,” Wills said, adding a helicopter from Canadian Forces Base Trenton searched until the early hours of the morning.  Police haven’t yet released the man’s name.  Guy's first name was Serge.  Check out Fish-hawk.net for the story and a pic of the guy.  One of those Kayak anglers.  Sad"
