138001,Entropy,2007-11-29 18:55:00,747,How do I get my directions to be in km's not miles??  Entropy
138002,davis,2007-11-29 18:58:00,128,"should be a ""settings"" link under the logo...make the change there"
138011,Terry,2007-11-29 19:33:00,14456,I could never find it so I do it the old fashion way....1 miles = 1.609344 km
138012,bassman,2007-11-29 19:42:00,384,use google maps
138013,kickingfrog,2007-11-29 19:43:00,8333,"Yep, settings right under the Mapquest logo, don't forget to save the new setting. Personally I've been using Goggle maps more lately. The detailed satellite photos of the some of the ""bigger"" cities are quite amazing (in a peeking through the neighbours window sort of way)."
138014,addy79,2007-11-29 19:54:00,573,"google maps buddy, mapquest blows"
138020,Entropy,2007-11-29 20:18:00,747,"Found the ""Settings"" button.  Will take a look at googly maps next time  Thanks all.  Entropy"
138044,Beats,2007-11-29 22:36:00,543,  I couldn't have said it better.  In alot of places Mapquest doesn't even show rivers and lakes.  It's extremely poorly detailed for a map site.
138092,JohnF,2007-11-30 01:43:00,3494, Go to NYC and zoom in on Manhattan if you haven't already. Very cool.  JF
