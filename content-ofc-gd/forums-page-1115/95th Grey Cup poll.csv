136957,misfish,2007-11-25 18:52:00,29133,"Next to Bills,I like the Green Machine.LOL"
136970,kingjames_2nd,2007-11-25 19:57:00,72,"It's all about the blue bombers!!  I have to root for them because they are the RAT-BAST***S that took out the Argos.  (granted the argos sucked out the last game)  However,  having lost their starting QB to a broken arm,  I feel any betting man  should place money on SASK.  Never the less;  I like a good under dog story.  Here's to the Bombers!    also   LETS GO ARGOS  .....  because I can."
