Here is the link: CANTIRE FLYER   This product helped my wife IMMENSELY!!!  She has suffered from scoliosis for years.  I've bought some for family members too.   It’s cheap and actually comfortable even if your back doesn’t hurt.  It’s portable too. Carol takes it everywhere. (in the car, restaurants, movies. uh...anywhere you sit?) We bought a couple and kept them at our parents houses too.   Basically, your tail bone sits in the semi-circular cut-out and this relieves some of the pressure on the nasty lumbers/lumbars.  Simple but effective.  BUY ONE!!!  THEY ARE ON SALE!!!!! $15 cdn tire  (Thanks Cliff, LOL)  Ciao!"

136294,Gerritt,2007-11-23 16:42:00,6129,No doubt shawn... after spending all day on the water with HeadHunter.. my back was toast the next day..  Perhaps it could be the cheap BPS (70.00) seats as well.  I will certainly look into it!  G
136299,snag,2007-11-23 16:57:00,1932,My wife kept them on most of the seats at home (instead of moving one from room to room) and I have to admit that I've grown accustomed to them.  They have little handle on them to carry them easily (they only weigh about a pound)  My mom put a soft cover on hers for aesthetics and comfort.
136434,dsn,2007-11-23 23:22:00,1018,I just checked the weekly flyer couldn't find anything. Then I went on thier main items and found this.  Is it this one?   or is it this one?    None of the above are $15 bucks.  dsn

136447,ccmtcanada,2007-11-23 23:42:00,7971," Hey Shawn....I have one that I no longer need.  Tell you what...I'll trade you the cushion for your extra transom saver....hehe.  I used to use it all the time, but now that I'm using the Corolla all the time my head hits the ceiling of the car....LOL."
136449,dsn,2007-11-23 23:47:00,1018,  ahhh ok. I got it.  thanks
136815,Beans,2007-11-25 02:00:00,3339,These are a helluva lot cheaper ($15) than the coccyx cushion I bought at Shopper's Drug Mart Health Centre ($60)...  Mind you the receipt was tax deductable as a medical expense...
137433,dsn,2007-11-27 16:04:00,1018,I was at CT today and picked up two. Feels good to finally sit on something a bit more firmer.   Thanks  dsn
