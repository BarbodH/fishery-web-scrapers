136911,ranger520vx,2007-11-25 15:55:00,164,"Wow what a long wait for my favourite Steelhead River to get fishable this fall- BUT the wait yielded one of the greatest QUALITY days I can remember with NON STOP ACTION on WILD STEELHEAD all day long.  You cant put a price on not seeing another soul but your fishing buddy over 2 miles of H2O, no garbage left behind by loogans, deer stopping to look us down and hundreds of Geese flying overhead.  All fish caught floatfishing roe with 4-6lb flurocarbon tippet just about everywhere we had 3 feet of water or more. Pools, runs, bend,overhangs,undercuts, pockets-DIDN'T MATTER.  Its gonna be a great 5 weeks of open season yet for 2007 and cashing in some lieu time to punish my elbow and shoulders some more. STAY TUNED for more reports.   Enjoy the    Caseysâ€™ first bow of the day    Marks First bow of the day    Average Size all day long    Hard to take    PERFECTION!!     "
