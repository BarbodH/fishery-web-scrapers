137568,fishindevil,2007-11-28 00:55:00,6254,"Nice Fishing machine !!!!   and its a LUND.  ...now you have to get her all rigged out,and get her all ready for the spring !!! man its hard when you get a boat this late in the year and have to put her away into storage,it happened to me last year as well.great looking ,boatand it looks spotless,they sure took care of her,great decision to buy her,well done...cheers"
137569,icefisherman,2007-11-28 00:57:00,952,"Doug,  you are much closer to the target this time my friend ;-)  And your quoted text is in the same spot (the target) as well. As soon as I do all the CT certification formalities, licensing, plates, swing tongue....I'll take the boat to the 401 in Milton and ask those truck weight station to tell me what is the total trailer/boat/motors weight...then I'll do the bathroom scale test and hope I am within limits...it does feel much heavier on the tongue then the old boat but it is also much easier to pull with the Pathfinder...so I am a bit confused on this one....maybe the trailer/wheels/bearings are nicer/better hence the easier tow...?!!?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
137570,icefisherman,2007-11-28 01:00:00,952,"  Thanks Bud. I've already filed my application for acceptance in the Lund club with Wayne ha ha ha  Waiting on his approval shortly, so I can join the proud LUND owners  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
