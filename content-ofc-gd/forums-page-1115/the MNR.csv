137429,Terry,2007-11-27 15:44:00,14456,"ok I tried to get my 3 year card and licenses online..no you can't do that....  yesterday I got the renewal card in the mail so $136.77  later it's back in the mail..wonder how long it will take to get the new one back to me...any bets   OK 2006 was the last time they changed the regs, because they couldn't get the 2007 regs. out in time..so they said  does anyone think they will have the 2008 regs. out before 2008 before 2009  or maybe just early Feb. 2008...  I mean they have had 2 years to get the regs together and up on the website, how hard is it............     there I feel better already"
137430,Mike Pike,2007-11-27 15:52:00,1332,"Sorry Terry, how come you couldn't get your licence and card on-line?  Cuz I got my 3 year on-line just last night!"
137432,Terry,2007-11-27 15:57:00,14456,well I tried about a week ago and it would not let me I sent an email and they replied that they were not set up to do next years licenses on line yet  so I guess it's ready now...LOL
137434,Mike Pike,2007-11-27 16:11:00,1332,"Ya, give 'er a go Terry.  Pretty convenient.  You can print out your license right away and stick it in your wallet 'til your card arrives( they say in a couple weeks )."
137441,bigfish1965,2007-11-27 16:49:00,3382,"THe new regs are tied up at the Federal level right now. The province finished them awhile ago, but since many of the laws cover two jurisdictions, both levels have to sign off on them.  Why is it $137 for you Terry? Should be about $71."
137442,Roy,2007-11-27 16:51:00,13728,"Terry I got my 3 year sport lic. online on the 15th of November, prior to going to the BOQ G2G. I'm good till Dec. 31st 2010. It took all of a minute and a half."
137448,irishfield,2007-11-27 17:26:00,26272,Also note anyone with an apostrophy in their last name can't renew on line. They don't have a smart enough programmer apparently to avoid the syntax error that generates. I had to renew by mail last year because they couldn't work around that one (and it's 5 minute programming fix) !
137449,Terry,2007-11-27 17:29:00,14456,outdoor card 3 year sport fishing 3 year small game...never know when I want to go after beaver  cost of the  licence total 136.77  beaver......... priceless
137451,Terry,2007-11-27 17:32:00,14456,"and it was the 10th of nov. I tried here is the email they sent me  Greetings,  Unfortunately our systems are not yet set up for renewal, which is why it did not give you the option online. You will receive a renewal package towards the end of the month, and at that time you can go online or on our automated telephone system to renew, and you would get your new card within 20 days.

137453,bigfish1965,2007-11-27 17:39:00,3382,None of my credit cards have an apostrophe either. All that is needed is for the field to aoutmatically parse the apostrophe into Â’ so that it doesn't mangle the input. Unfortunately this often results in a /' instead of just '.

137485,Headhunter,2007-11-27 19:20:00,5703,"Got my renewal form in the mail on Friday and renewed via the phone system. It was easy and fast... the only potential draw back being, I have to wait for the card to come in before I can fish in 2008. They said on the phone that it would take up to 20 days for the card to arrive. I hope they have their poop together as I may/will want to hit Quinte again early in the new year and would prefer to be ""legal"" at that time! HH"
137489,aniceguy,2007-11-27 19:25:00,1094,"look for new regs for 2008, DFO has given perliminary approval, lots of changes about to come with some additional major changes to come mid cycle as pertaining to the GL's"
137490,KyleM,2007-11-27 19:27:00,218,"Why dosnt the entire online community for Ontario set-up some big protest at Queens.  The new minister has got to go, major changes in the system need to be done."
137495,Mike Pike,2007-11-27 19:42:00,1332,"HeadHunter, you should have gotten a temporary license e-mailed to you.  Print it and stick it in your wallet.  Pretty sure they do that will all renewals.  They did with me anyway..."
137522,bigfish1965,2007-11-27 21:05:00,3382,It isn't the MNR holding up the regs it is the federal government. Try and give the new Minister a few weeks on the job before we arrange for a tar and feather.
137525,kickingfrog,2007-11-27 21:17:00,8333,  I've never needed a licence for beaver.
137527,dsn,2007-11-27 21:41:00,1018,What is the price now for a 3yr sportfishing license and conservation license by the way?   Thanks  dsn
137576,KyleM,2007-11-28 01:09:00,218,"Rick, I wasnt reffering to the Lic. aspect of it.....just the general overhaul of everything. Last year I didnt have my card on me (my own fault) and was stopped by an officer. She called in my name and number and said it wasnt in the system yet for the year, keep in mind this was October.  I know the feds wont put anymore money into it but we atleast need to try.  Theres no need to wait for the tar and feather, she should have never been given the job in the first place.  I guess its the same situation as Mr Fergusson and MLSE.  Why wait for things to go further in the wrong direction?"
137693,Marc Thorpe,2007-11-28 14:50:00,621,oops
137701,bassjnkie,2007-11-28 15:18:00,1101,"I renewed online a week ago, before even getting the papers in the mail. Thats funny you couldn't get it Terry. Maybe the site was messed that day.  Daniel OCH"
