138115,Sinker,2007-11-30 03:58:00,8692,I could see a boat wash working to stop spreading mussels......maybe.  Gobies have been in rice for longer than what they state in that report. The whole trent severn is going to have them.....its just a matter of time........  Sinker
138116,irishfield,2007-11-30 04:05:00,26272,"Zebras.. spinny water flea..and I know the livewell on my old boat could hold minnows even when it was ""drained""...as the drain plug went out the side, not a back corner so Gobies could live in it..but you'd have to have scooped them somehow I guess. Mind you that is where I'd put my minnow bucket to run down the lake."
138117,Greencoachdog,2007-11-30 04:14:00,8163,Gobies are a good forage fish and Gobie imitations are good lures. If ya can't beat them... join them!
138131,OhioFisherman,2007-11-30 05:19:00,6623,Isn`t Rice Lake on the Trent-Severn waterway? Locks? do they really expect them to lock out gobies?

138147,Blake,2007-11-30 12:15:00,418,"We have had them for a while down in the Hastings end of the lake, but with more and more coming in and them reproducing they will be all over the lake in droves.  It will be interesting to see what this prolific lake will sustain over the next few years."
138149,Roy,2007-11-30 12:36:00,13728,"Just think of the business opportunities! Mini rod pods,  micro line out alarms, miniature corn....shore fishing space will be at a premium!"
