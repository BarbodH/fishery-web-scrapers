137732,Dartee,2007-11-28 17:37:00,47,"After the long anticipated wait, the new 2008-2009 regs are out in print Of cource the on-line version is not yet available"
137737,Terry,2007-11-28 17:56:00,14456,did you see them at a store  I would like to pick up a copy
137738,ccmtcanada,2007-11-28 17:57:00,7971,Could you scan the pages and post here??? hehe
137741,keram,2007-11-28 18:24:00,585,"I dod not know why they wasting paper, because there are only 2 pages of changes for 2007 (ends in 30 days )  See here  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html  maybe I've missed something, but I do not see any regs for 2008/2009"
137743,FinS,2007-11-28 18:30:00,463, He said they are out on paper its not available online yet
137744,keram,2007-11-28 18:38:00,585,"  Like I've said ""maybe I've missed something"", but on the MNR website I could not find any references to 2008/2009 regs ( in print or online)"
137745,ccmtcanada,2007-11-28 18:41:00,7971, That's because they are working at the speed of government.  It'll be available online a month before the 2010 regs are to come out.
137746,keram,2007-11-28 18:44:00,585," Youp, I've forgot about the obvious  . At the same time it looks that Dartee has some ""insider"" knowledge"
137747,Terry,2007-11-28 18:47:00,14456,"they never do give much info on the printed regs. they just show up at stores and beer stores and what not...  and as stated on line regs. not  published yet so you will not see anything on line , till the online regs are on line...LOL"
137751,keram,2007-11-28 19:20:00,585,"I've just finished conversation with MNR in Peterborough. For whatever it is worth.....  Q. Are we going to have printed version of fishing regs for 2008 ? A. Yes. It will be available on Monday  Q. What about on-line Version. A. It should be there already  Q. Will it cover 2008/2009 or just 2008 A. I'm not 100% sure,  I'm 95% positive that it will cover only 2008"
137755,Terry,2007-11-28 19:30:00,14456,"good, I do hope to get a copy ..  it will probably be one page and state  ""see 2005 regs and make these 5 changes"""
137769,SlowPoke,2007-11-28 20:26:00,2984, I'm willing to beer the check store daily for the new reg's. I'll let you guys found if I know them. <brrrappp!)  
137772,keram,2007-11-28 20:30:00,585, You know that from time to time they show up in the Liquor Store too
137783,Dartee,2007-11-28 21:19:00,47, Some one I know had picked up a copy at LeBarons in Ottawa.
137785,Dartee,2007-11-28 21:21:00,47," CMTC ,,I was thinking the same thing when I saw that they were not online."
137787,keram,2007-11-28 21:53:00,585," I was thinking hard, cleaning my back yard, what stopped you to include this info in your first post"
137788,misfish,2007-11-28 21:55:00,29133, Why ? Do you catch fish ?  J/K Buddy. Guess thier good til 3045 ?
137789,Terry,2007-11-28 22:12:00,14456,"no I don't catch any fish  but you never know maybe one day I will and if I have the regs, I will know if I can eat it or throw it back"
