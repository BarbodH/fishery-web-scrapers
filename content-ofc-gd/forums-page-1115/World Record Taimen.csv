Worlds largest salmonid, and what's truly amazing about these fish is the small shallow rivers they inhabit. Definitely one of my dream trips would be flyfishing for these beasts...  Anyhow check this out, an excerpt from the I.G.F.A. newsletter:  "
137828,highdrifter,2007-11-29 00:40:00,2534,"Excellent!  That's a huge taimen.  Good to know it was released, considering where it was caught.  I've seen reports of such fish being caugnt, one such report in the Post, to which the angler had claimed to land on tackle, but it had the obvious scars from a gill net, so I don't think the brute made it back to the water...  An encouraging sign..  Thanks Solo!  cheers HD"

138035,Kirk,2007-11-29 21:45:00,347,I've fished taimen waters...got skunked but plan on going back to take a second shot at them within the next 2 years.
138037,Moosebunk,2007-11-29 21:50:00,3970,A dream  Looks like a cross between a brown and laker.  Which in that part of the world could have been some long shot possibility eons ago.
138055,glen,2007-11-29 23:41:00,2641,Nice looking fish.   There was a show on fishing taimen a few days ago.  The guy got one nice one.  Heck of a trip for one fish though.
138091,Greencoachdog,2007-11-30 01:40:00,8163,I've read about fishin' for them. They use the rear end (hind quarters) of a local large rodent for bait!
