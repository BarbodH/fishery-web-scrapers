136594,Woodsman,2007-11-24 10:06:00,1286,"Not really. Too much talking about fishing for her tastes. I told her sorry "" but this group is not likely to be up on the soap opera scene""."
136704,taper,2007-11-24 20:07:00,611,Brian I am pretty sure I will be there as well.
137166,SlowPoke,2007-11-26 19:17:00,2984,I just got off the phone with Terry at the Final Score to confirm our reservation - we're all good! Reservation is under OFC or Ontario Fishing Network.  I reminded Terry about the half price wings and $10 pitchers. He mentioned to me that with larger groups they add a 10% gratuity on the bills for the servers. When you receive you bill have a look for it and tip accordingly or in case they forgot!  -Brian
137918,SlowPoke,2007-11-29 09:50:00,2984,"Okay, Taper had something come up and he will not be attending. So, if anybody was on the fence about attending but didn't want to go because Taper was going to be there.... Just kidding Taper, I just wanted to bump the thread! -Brian"
