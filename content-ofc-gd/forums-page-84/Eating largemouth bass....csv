I couldn't waste it, so I brought it home, filleted it, and sprinkled my special fish spice I brought home from St Martins on both sides.  Left it over night in the fridge then prepared it as I do panfish.  It was amazing. I sure hope that bass don't become the next table fair target though!"
1011136,crappieperchhunter,2017-08-11 20:30:00,2582, Pike virtually never have grubs.  I think mid sized (2 to 5 lbs) pike is one of the best eating fish we have in Ontario.  I agree with this 100%.  Never get out for pike much...but when I do I'm more then happy to keep a limit of 2-5 LBers. Lots of good eats there.

I don't like to waste meat so I filet the ""normal"" way and leave the y bones in.  Just take them out while you eat.  They are easy to find because they are all in a row.  Its easier on larger fish.  On a smaller one, they are small and fine so its a bit of a pain."
1011211,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-12 17:30:00,8243,"We would take the strip of Y bones from a Northern, put them in a food processor with egg, bread crumbs and spices and blend it.

1009668,akaShag,2017-07-22 13:33:00,2073,"I am an unrepentant eater of fish.  Yes I release fish, but yes I keep fish to EAT.  Largemouth bass are DELICIOUS and I have eaten many hundreds of them over the years, from dozens of lakes.  I used to go every year to a cottage on Desert Lake north of Kingston, and we would have a community fish fry of all the cottagers, 25 to 30 people, and we would do fish and chips in a propane deep fryer.  And ""EVERYBODY"" loved the largemouth bass.  I suggest keeping smaller fish, two pounds or less, since they will be the tastiest.  You could batter them, but then what you are tasting is pretty much batter.  A better choice, in my view, is to take the skinned fillets, shake them in Fish Crisp, and pan fry them in hot vegetable oil.  They are cooked when you can insert a fork easily into the thickest part of the fillet.  Drain on paper towels, and enjoy!  As for the grubs, just remove them with the tip of your filleting knife.  They won't hurt you even if you eat some - you will never notice them in a cooked fillet.  If you also catch crappies, they are even better eating.  Cook them the same way.  That ""mud line"" to which reference is made has stayed in all of my bass fillets, with no noticeable effect on taste.  But all of the above comes with one caveat:  if it is stinking HOT, and the water is WARM, take any fish you plan to eat, kill it immediately, and get it onto ice.  Under no circumstance should you drag fish along in warm water on a stringer - that will surely cause your otherwise tasty treat to be less palatable and less firm.  And don't feel guilty about keeping some fish for a meal or two!!!  Doug the evil eater of fish"

Many people who dislike bass have dragged the fish around on a stringer for hours in 30 degree weather until it was dead and changing color before filleting it. All of my fish get bled and tossed on ice ASAP whenever possible and result is definitely worth having a cooler/ice on board."

Like all fish, they need to be kept alive until cleaning, or killed and iced immediately.  I don't bleed bass, pike, walleye.  I do bleed trout and salmon though.  If I can see a lot of gubs on the fins of a bass, I don't keep them.  I will pick out a couple grubs, but if a fish has lots, its too ""ick"" for me.  Pike virtually never have grubs.

The taste of fish , like animals, depends on their food and their environment. I once caught a pike at the base of a big rapid. It leapt in the air when I hooked it. It was quite muscular with firm flesh, quite unlike those couch potatoes that hang around weed beds waiting for the next easy meal.  I grew up catching small brook trout. You could pretty well tell where they came from by their taste."

1010696,Canuck,2017-08-05 20:00:00,491,"Ok, I have another recipe for you that I learned down in Florida for redfish and any other relatively firm fish that you can grill on the BBQ.  Soft fish it wont work on.  This REALLY works.  You pat dry the filets and then sprinkle old bay on them (works with salt and pepper too).  Let it sit for about 10 minutes.  Then coat the filets with a decent amount of mayonaise. Not salad dressing, and not the ""lite"" mayo.  The good old Helmans kind.  Then you grill on the BBQ.  the mayo has oil in it that helps keep the fish from stciking, but it browns and grills up nice.  It works great on firm fish that can be grilled right on the grates.  Give it a try and let me know how it works for you.  (I have done fresh GBay salmon and its fantastic.)"

1009460,sauce,2017-07-19 22:26:00,219,I believe the biggest reason that people don't eat bass is because they are notorious for the yellow grub parasite. I have heard of people keeping them and picking the odd grub here and there from the fillets. I've also heard of people being very disappointed to find that their fillets are so grubby that they end up throwing them away.
1009461,chris.brock,2017-07-19 22:36:00,4053," Back in the day we used to eat them quite often and they are good.  I'd bring some oil, cut the fillets into chunks, batter, heat the oil on the fire and deep fry'em."

A big 3lb small will have much better meat than a 3lb large.  Ideally those nice little eater size fish around a 1.5lb  are pretty similar in size and taste.  I ate a 5lb large from a deep lake a year ago. Wouldn't do that again, flesh was too soft.  None of this worm stuff but I don't think I eat fish from south of say Huntsville very often."

I prefer not frying fish which I haven't done with bass so I should probably give it another chance before saying it's bad.  The thing is, there is usually better fish to be had for cooking.  Is there pike where you're going?  If so keep the hammer handles, take out the Y bones and they are as good tasting as walleye imo."

I've never fished for crappie but I would sure try, and we'd try eating some for sure. There are walleyes there to but they are out in deeper water, and we are canoeing in to an island. Lots of shallow water around and looks like a ton of lmb spots. I think we'll try to cook some lmb in the 1.5lb range as a few people here suggest. I'll remove the mud line as well. I guess it all comes down to the personal experience you've had and what your own taste buds tell you. We'll give it a try (and hopefully survive to tell the story haha!) I will look more into crappie fishing since I've never targeted them before. Between a few nice crappies and a couple 1.5lb bass we should stay nicely fed. Thanks for the help everyone!

It has been  sometime though, so maybe this fall once the water cools down, I will treat my pop to a few 2 pounders.  After all, they are there to catch and eat."
1009590,aplumma,2017-07-20 22:12:00,6896,My favorite is Crappie followed by Channel Catfish in the 1-3 lb range. Both are deep fried and sanctified. I don't eat bass because I find them mushy for the most part. It might be because of how warm the water is down here. Crappie will bite small jigs trolled just below the light level penetration no deeper than 30% of the waters depth. I usually put 2 jigs 1/16 to1/8 oz jigs below a float (legal here) and slow troll till I catch a fish. I then throw out a marker and then a second marker 5ft further and back off the school. The floats will point to the place you caught the fish and then you can fish the edge of the school and work your way in till they scatter. Crappie will move up to feed but rarely move down to find food. Overcast days and night are the best time bright sunlight tends to drive them deep and are harder to catch. A light hand is needed when hooking and playing them they are nicknamed papermouths for a good reason. Enjoy the fishing and the meal.   Art
