That was until this noisy tooner , with a gas engine came buy. WHY , WHY WHY ?. LOL   I wish I had a way of zooming in on my GP, it was a stunning sight to behold.      As for the fishing part, I had double and triple chasers. I could not get any of them to commit.  125 fow down to 100 fow.  I was blown away. Some even chased for 2-3 minutes. Go up, fall back, Drop the bait, and they would come screaming in again. Even down sized my presentation. Same results.  So you,ll be happy to hear, there was no WACKING, going on today, on the toon.     "
