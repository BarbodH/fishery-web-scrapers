1011863,Squid,2017-08-22 17:09:00,1656," I'm trying to wrap my tired old brain around this, why would looking at the sun during an eclipse be any worse for your eyes than looking at it on a normal clear day?  I believe that it has to do with the sunlight being mostly blocked giving your pupils a chance to dilate thus exposing more retina to the suns rays.  From the net:  You actually can safely look at a total solar eclipse while the sun is _totally_ blocked by the moon. It looks like the moon has a fiery white aura, and it is one of the more spectacular things I have ever seen. So why do people say it's dangerous to look at a solar eclipse? Well, in general (during non-eclipse times), you've probably been told not to stare at the sun. This is because the sun simply outputs more power than our eye is designed to handle, and exposing our eye to that kind of power can damage the retina. And in a nutshell, solar eclipses are dangerous because the sun can come out from behind the moon and ""surprise you"" before you have a chance to look away. And this is actually even worse than when you normally look away from the sun because during the total eclipse, it is dark out, and your pupil therefore dilates so that it can let in enough light to get a good picture. Then, when the sun reappears and starts flooding the area with really bright light, not only are you staring straight at it, but your eye is in a state where it is wide open, and actively trying to let in as much light as possible. This explains why it is easy to damage your eye when watching a total solar eclipse, and why you should either be sure to time it very carefully (and allow for a good margin of error), or just view the thing through one of those sets of cheap ""dark"" glasses they sell for the express purpose of looking at the sun without getting hurt."

ATV versus bicycle, no helmet, picked his little body up off the dirt road with a GCS of about 7.  He may not see the sun or moon again.  Heard the eclipse was a little anit-climactic though."

1011989,hotsky,2017-08-24 01:03:00,400,I was out kayaking on Monday and if I didn't know about the eclipse I would have not even noticed anything. :/
1011630,bobowski,2017-08-18 21:47:00,360,On Monday August 21st at approximately 2pm we will be experiencing a solar eclipse. A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the Earth and the Sun causing an Eclipse. I will be out fishing at this time. I was thinking about this and wondering if this will have any affect on the fishing during the time of the eclipse. On Monday it will be a new Moon phase so this in particular should make it a decent day for fishing but do you guys think that the eclipse will alter this in any way? LOL Maybe I'm just over thinking this but in my head the fish will just be jumping into the boat during the eclipse (joking).
1011631,misfish,2017-08-18 22:00:00,29133,"Heard today on the radio, those special glasses that make the watching safe, have been scooped up fast and hard to buy at a local store. They are sell for up to $30 on Kijiji. $3 glasses . LOL  Money to be made on anything these days.  UNREAL  At 2 pm, I,ll be too busy working, and probly fixing some machine."
1011632,MJIG,2017-08-18 22:02:00,227,"The path of totality nearest to us will be from Nashville over to South Carolina. It will actually get dark like night there for a couple of minutes.  Around here, where it will be a partial eclipse, an approaching dark thunderstorm probably has a more dramatic effect on the fishing. Please do let us know if you notice any change though."

1011703,pics,2017-08-20 13:42:00,1268,I have been seeing these warnings about keeping your pet inside so they don't get eye damage.. Lol.. As if they would actually look at the sun to watch it.. The only species on the planet that is dumb enough for that is the human one..

1011727,MJIG,2017-08-20 16:58:00,227," In the path of totality during the eclipse (not in Canada this time) it will actually become fairly  dark during totality and your pupils will dilate in the darkness. If you aren't careful with the timing, the sun is then going to instantly pop back into view from behind the moon, and you can certainly experience eye damage under those conditions."

1011791,glen,2017-08-21 14:43:00,2641,Clear sky so far today.  Might be able to see the effect.  I would expect it to affect the fishing but by how much?
1011799,AKRISONER,2017-08-21 15:58:00,5558,co-worker booked a meeting at 2 lol were going to the park to check it out....not a cloud in the sky here.
1011804,captpierre,2017-08-21 17:11:00,2521,I'm betting that it won't be as good as the hype. Only 70 % coverage. Like a dark cloud kinda day. Saw the last one 30+ yrs ago. Disappointed We get 100% coverage with next one in 2024
1011805,AKRISONER,2017-08-21 17:52:00,5558,"we went for a quick peak as it started, its friggin cool...weve got the glasses. Ive never looked at the sun before...it was neat enough to just do that."
1011810,dave524,2017-08-21 19:12:00,4508,"Pretty much a non event here , even at the height of coverage it was sunny and distinct shadows, it gets darker out with a cloud passing over the sun. All the hype leads you to believe you'd have to turn on headlights and the streetlight would come on   ."

1011815,grimsbylander,2017-08-21 19:44:00,3016,"That was very close to unnoticeable. There was a very slight ting of gray in the light when looking outside but honestly, if I didn't know about it, I would not have even noticed. I drove to Hamilton between 1:45 and 2:15 and couldn't tell the difference."
1011817,manitoubass2,2017-08-21 19:49:00,11391,"Probably see some cool pics from the Midwest US. From Ontario it would only be partial anyhow.  Here it's cloudy and raining so I didn't see jack, not even in a Limeyangler video"

1011826,TennesseeGuy,2017-08-21 21:24:00,957,Got the full blown deal in Central Tennessee where weather was ideal.   There were lots of free glasses and also some stores gouging the public by charging high prices.  I enjoyed a similar experience in Florida during March 1970.   Not as much hype and excitement for that one as it was prior to Facebook and our having 5 year old youngsters going through graduation ceremonies from kindergarten.

Did notice a slight darkening at the max but not much great thing to see though weather was great hopefully next time the weather will co-operate again. Tried taking photos with my Ipod but could not get the exposure right very tough to do.  Kawartha Kev
