1011088,manitoubass2,2017-08-11 03:30:00,11391,He won!  Wow! Huge upset
1011109,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-11 16:25:00,8243,"Around here it's hockey, baseball ( when the Jays are winning) and fishing in that order. Good for him and Canada."
1011121,Headhunter,2017-08-11 17:48:00,5703,"We watched that match last night and I gotta say that it was some of the most entertaining tv we have seen in a long time! Talk about David vs Goliath! So proud of the way this youngster has represented Canada and most likely will continue to do so... unlike a certain young lady who see's herself representing her country as a ""burden"". HH"
1011124,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-11 18:32:00,8243,don't know if we all know how big an upset this is? This is almost Buster Douglass beating Mike Tyson type of upset. If this kid can keep his head on straight he has a great future in international tennis. He is already the Wimbleton Jr. Champion. As long as he stays away from pretty young female Olympians he will be big.   http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/inside-post-match-celebration-denis-shapovalov/
1011128,manitoubass2,2017-08-11 19:08:00,11391,Oh it's a huuuuge upset!  Nadal is a god in tennis. I hope this young lad continues to progress!
1011169,John Bacon,2017-08-12 01:16:00,3277,He won again.  He is the semi finals now.
1011171,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-12 01:21:00,8243,"Good on the kid. Another great Canadian athlete, born in Israel of Soviet parents."
