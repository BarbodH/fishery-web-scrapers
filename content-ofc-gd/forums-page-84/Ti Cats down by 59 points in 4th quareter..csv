1010475,grimsbylander,2017-08-02 18:40:00,3016,If I were a QB I would want the guys in front of me to not want to see me flattened. Hope there's harmony there at least.
1010604,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-04 04:17:00,8243,"A real letter given to the team by a ""true"" fan. Was it you Fish Farmer?   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ticats-letter-1.4233429"
1010612,Fish Farmer,2017-08-04 14:25:00,2234,"A real letter given to the team by a ""true"" fan. Was it you Fish Farmer?   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ticats-letter-1.4233429  I think they felt the fans embarrassment. They better win tonight against a team that has all their best players on the injured list. If they don't win, I'll feel like a Leaf Fan. Got to check out Value Village for some T-Cats wear."
1010660,Fish Farmer,2017-08-05 12:58:00,2234,"Anyone want season tickets, cat wig, face paint, and jerzey. Next home game I'm going fishing for Sheephead, can't lose. Johnny, fill me in, where's the Sheep hiding. I can tell you where a fan will be hiding. "
1010668,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-05 15:45:00,8243,"I'm down in Missouri for the weekend, picked up the end of the game on the TV. Even down here they can't win for losing. I can't bring myself to watch CFL this year. I don't recognize but a few names on each team. QB's are the only constant, same guys different teams every 2 years. Not good to develop a solid fan base. Once the NFL cuts start the revolving door is going to need a grease job.  Dave, can you name 10 players on the Cats, without looking?  And by the way, leave all my trophy farm animals alone, none in Lake O?"

Bring back #1 Bruce"
1011235,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-13 01:18:00,8243,"Only down by 16 at the 11 minute mark of the 3rd quarter. Better than 17 I guess.  June Jones Fish Farmer, June Jones? And they fire probably the best coach on the team they had. Not fair to blame Reinbold, not fair, set him up to fail."
1011250,Fish Farmer,2017-08-13 17:03:00,2234,"And who failed last night, who they going to blame now. Austin, Ptaszek and Zack would be my choice. Should have put Masoli in."
1011263,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-13 20:07:00,8243,"Zack hasn't been Zack since he tore up his knee. How is he going to be able to play well when the defensive line and backers are in the backfield by the time he takes 2 steps. Something like 4 sacks in the 1st half. I don't know who he is but that right tackle is atrocious. He is pushed backwards 2 yards on every play on the snap of the ball. 63 I think. On the other side where's the safety? He's 10 yards from the play when the corner is man to man. That's his job, support the corner on man on man when the middle is clear. At least they dressed Gable, and he played well but, he is however a terrible pass blocker and that was proven last night. . He has been a healthy scratch, not even dressed, which is football talk for being benched.  Kent Austin's head is going to explode on live TV, poor guy I feel for him and you Dave, me too a bit because I'm an Hamilton East Ender no matter where I live.  But hey they are only 0-7, go 9 and 9 or even 8 and 10 and they are in the playoff the way the east is playing. Go 11 and 10 and they win the Grey Cup.  I gotta go, packing the boat to go FISHING for 3 days."
1011284,bigugli,2017-08-14 10:07:00,6138,I hope they can at least redeem themselves on the long weekend? Oh the shame!!! if they can't
1010209,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-30 04:21:00,8243,It will be announced Monday afternoon July 31st 2017 that management is going in a different direction and that Head Coach Kent Austin has stepped down and Defensive Co-ordinator Jeff Rhinebolt will assume the position of interim Head Coach until the Hamilton Tiger Cats can find someone that can win a game.
1010215,Fish Farmer,2017-07-30 11:51:00,2234,I wouldn't want to wear any Ticat garb around town. I'm scared to face my buds. Our best players that are on the other teams are cremating us.

1010220,Toronto_Angler,2017-07-30 15:01:00,698,When does the NFL season start again?
1010221,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-30 15:28:00,8243,Not soon enough.
1010298,Mike Pike,2017-07-31 13:22:00,1332,They keep announcing a sell out at Tim Horton's field but the place has looked half empty on tv.  That tells me that even those who have paid for tickets don't want to go and watch 'em now.
1010300,AKRISONER,2017-07-31 14:00:00,5558,lol...CFL  has the league folded yet? or are they going to continue to keep letting it die off  in alignment with the fanbase that is dying off of old age.  I dont know a single person under the age of 50 years old that watches the CFL.
1010306,DRIFTER_016,2017-07-31 15:43:00,10439,Mike Borger will be crying in his rum while catching giant fish!!!
1010314,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-31 18:06:00,8243,"The CFL has been dead for the last 30 years, they just forget to lay down and go quietly. It's like your very first lover, there is always a special place for them in your heart."
1010315,manitoubass2,2017-07-31 18:15:00,11391,Oh don't let ticha read that lol
1010321,Mike Pike,2017-07-31 18:56:00,1332,"I actually prefer watching the CFL game over the NFL.  With less downs, more is at stake on each play.  Also with CFL, the game is never over, unless of course it's 60-1 ( lol )."
1010322,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-31 19:03:00,8243,"Yea, as if I were her first. She still visited his Mom when she was alive. I encouraged her, I'm 62 not 22."
1010323,manitoubass2,2017-07-31 19:06:00,11391,Good stuff. Just saying that can be dangerous territory
1010324,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-31 19:07:00,8243,I actually enjoy Jr. and NFC Football better than both. These kids do if for the love of the game. Guys get shift changes to attend practice and play on weekends. You might get a Cop playing on the line next to the guy that has to get signed out of the Barton St. Pokey to play.
1010341,misfish,2017-07-31 22:28:00,29133,"It,s ARGO time again. And the Bills will follow. Thats all I got to say about this thread. LOL"

1010352,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-01 00:18:00,8243,"Is it just me but my impression is that OFC'ers are generally only Baseball and Hookey fans, and some fishing."

1010376,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-01 03:41:00,8243,"I think coach Austin is 1 generation too far removed to relate to his players today. That's one reason he has failed. He is the boss of a friend and have had him her for a meal and he is a good guy, but he is strict even to my standards. I see most head coaches in the CFL aren't too far removed from the game these days. Call me racist but I believe if a players number can't be read because his hair or dreadlocks covers it should be illegal, I don't care what race you are. Most players in the CFL today are all about the air time, just watch the after play antics. You made a tackle kid, pretend you have done it before, you didn't just score the winning TD in the Grey Cup. Man am I turning into my father? He threatened us to cut our Beatles hair cuts when we were sleeping at night. We were the ""Pepsia Cole generashina"". And he cut my brothers hair one night after afternoon shift!!!! I swear."

1010400,Mike Pike,2017-08-01 16:00:00,1332,"I don't think the Cats problem is the coach, Old Ironmaker.  I think it has more to do with not knowing who all these new players are?  I've never heard of most of these guys.  And as mentioned before, the guys you HAVE heard of are all playing great on other teams.  lol"
1010445,Fish Farmer,2017-08-02 11:27:00,2234,"I don't think the Cats problem is the coach, Old Ironmaker.  I think it has more to do with not knowing who all these new players are?

As you say NFL is a girls game. small field, 4 downs, no end zone.can't run after kick, what's with that?. NFL Players come up here, they need a GPS Don't want to say I'm a Cat fan because of MOD-Q"
1010448,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-02 12:12:00,8243,"Fist fight breaks out yesterday between QB1 Collaros and his O line and members of the defense. And Austin is laughing it off this AM on CHCH as normal, it's not. I understand a coach can only work with what's given him and he doesn't have much but the revolving door that is the CFL teams all have the same problem, player turnover. Disrespecting the so called leader on your team by teammates and physically trying to hurt him is just ridiculous. There's a reason he wears a red shirt at practice. The coach has lost this team."
1010461,BillM,2017-08-02 14:37:00,17367,"There were two scuffles according to TSN.   First one was some yapping between the QB and the D, on the next play a O line man and a D line man got into it.   Although it does happen more then people realize I'm sure."
1010462,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-02 15:00:00,8243,"Happens during camp, of course, but not 5 games into the season. At least not with teams that are not 0 and 5. I take it back, Kent won't be fired. He wears too many hats, VP of Operations amongst others. I want the team to do well. Since almost every team in this 8 team league makes the playoffs they still have a chance to be in the Grey Cup believe it or not. Go Cats Go."
