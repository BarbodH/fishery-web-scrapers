Does anybody have any local insight into species, lures or techniques for the area?? I will be in a 14ft boat, which means sheltered fishing within the bay and canal from a local marina launch. We will have a fish finder and broad selection of equipment to combine with 40 years of fishing experience for bass, walleye, lake trout etc."
