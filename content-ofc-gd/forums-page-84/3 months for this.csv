1010934,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-09 04:06:00,8243,The book wasn't heavy enough.
1010954,kickingfrog,2017-08-09 14:37:00,8333,Which 3 months?
1010956,jimmer,2017-08-09 14:42:00,2730,The administration involved in the fines and court costs was probably more than $1300.
1011004,grimsbylander,2017-08-10 01:21:00,3016,Guys like that will view the 3 month licence suspension as 25% off next years licence.
1011037,dave524,2017-08-10 17:37:00,4508,"Think there are two set of scales for overlimit fines, one for locals who just want to fill the larder for the family and another for out of town tourists. Well maybe a third set too,  but we won't discuss that."
1011039,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-10 17:46:00,8243, Only $1300.00? I bet my bottom dollar it cost much more. And the second guy's case hasn't come to trial yet.     
1011042,jimmer,2017-08-10 18:19:00,2730,I just saw a guy was fined $2500 for taking one hen turkey out of season with a .22 calibre on private property.  Karma was he got in a car accident leaving where he shot the bird and the police found the bird and his gun. I guess fish and birds aren't comparable.
