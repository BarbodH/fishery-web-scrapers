For 19.99 you get 4 store made subs,a choice of macroni,potatoe or coleslaw salad,350 gram package of store baked cookies,a family size store brand bag of  chips,and either a 4L bottle of water or 2L bottle of pop and then a day pass for any provincial park.  Great deal for a lunch and use the pass until October.  I used one it covered lunch for the day for the family and then paid for the ramp fees i used inside a provincial park."

1010940,Big Cliff,2017-08-09 07:53:00,6899,Free park pass? I thought there was no charge to get into any of the parks this year. Sounds like a great deal on the food though!
1010948,GBW,2017-08-09 13:29:00,8460,Free park pass? I thought there was no charge to get into any of the parks this year. Sounds like a great deal on the food though! If you signed up for the pass giveaway then yes.  If you didn't or don't have a pass to borrow then yeah you are paying.
1010950,SylvanOwner,2017-08-09 13:56:00,266,No charge for National Parks if you order a free pass on-line.  Covers entry only.  Good deal from the OP.
1010957,porkpie,2017-08-09 14:54:00,2521,"This is for provincial parks, not national.  The free pass giveaway at the start of the year was for Parks Canada national parks only, not Ontario parks."
1010958,John Bacon,2017-08-09 14:59:00,3277,Free park pass? I thought there was no charge to get into any of the parks this year. Sounds like a great deal on the food though!  It's federal parks that are free this year.  The OP said provincial parks.
