1011523,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-17 13:41:00,273,Went to Mark's the other day and the ones on sale I mentioned earlier in the thread were all gone and they didn't have much left on the shelves of other brands.  It's the time of year.  They would be phasing out their spring/summer clothing now for winter.  They did have the Helly Hensen (HH) brand and it looked like very nice rain gear at a fair price.  Went to Canadian Tire and the one near my location had SQUAT when it came to rain gear.  But I got lucky.  They had just a few pairs of rain pants (I already have a jacket) on an end display and it was just what I was looking for.  Rain paints that have zipper pockets and a pouch to store the pants in (which allow me to pack them in the little pouch and store them on the boat very easily).  The brand name is Woods and they were $50.
1011700,bow slayer,2017-08-20 13:11:00,1074,"I know it is a short drive for you but forest city surplus in london has some descent wetskins rain suits for about 150 bucks,,,,,i have had one for about 20 years looks good and still keeps me dry of course 20 years ago they were about 75 bucks lol....bibs and jacket.  also columbia makes some really good rain wear at a descent price.....again there is a wearhouse for columbia in london at the 401 behind the flyin j.....everything is at least 40 percent off retail.....downside is you need a invitation to shop in there but maybe a member on here from london could hook you up as they hand them out regularly to area workplaces"
1011702,Joeytier,2017-08-20 13:28:00,3990,"Viking suits are generally less than $150 and are a great product for the price.  Ive had my jacket for at least 5 years and everything works perfectly on it, no rips or tears and I dont baby my stuff."
1011741,mike rousseau,2017-08-20 18:27:00,4661,I love my cabelas guidewear  They go on sale at cabelas Canada for $250 per price ($500 for bibs and jacket/parka)  Usually free shipping over $99 too  Very good suits and if you take care of them they'll last you a long time
1011757,fish_fishburn,2017-08-20 23:54:00,1311,My brother put me onto to this concept. He is an avid motorcycle rider and his raingear for his bike puts all fishing raingear to shame. And the best part is its way way cheaper in price. Go to a bike shop and check out there rain gear. Anything made for fishing is over priced and we all agree with that.

1011814,Terry,2017-08-21 19:34:00,14456,"But lots of motorcycle rain gear does not have hoods or have crappy ones you pull out of a pouch on the collar, fisherman needs good hoods"
1011831,mike rousseau,2017-08-21 23:27:00,4661,Or a good sou'wester lol
1011870,Moosebunk,2017-08-22 18:47:00,3970,"When it comes to fall fishing and you might get soaked out there, I just put a cheaper rainsuit over my reasonably priced wet gear.  Have the Bone Dry pants... Have the BPS Qualifier jacket.  Both older now, both a little leaky here and there, but when it's pouring I pull out a Coleman rainsuit kept in it's own little baggy in the boat, and put it on over top. Nothing gets ya then.  If it's a warm rain... who cares.  If buying a single fall suit I'd just go Viking.  You'll sweat wet before you get rain wet, but it'll be a warm sweat. lol."
1011236,fishing n autograph,2017-08-13 01:31:00,2540,"Hey All,   I'm in the market for a rain suit. Can anyone recommend one that's not too expensive that's a decent quality? I got wet way too many times this week and decided that I need one lol  Thanks"
1011237,dheitzner,2017-08-13 01:51:00,314,"It's quite expensive, but the BPS 100MPH is tough to beat.  I have had one for 4 years and every time it rains, I'm reminded that (for me) it was money well spent.  Dry as a bone no matter how intense the downpour, even ripping at 50-60mph.  Like anything, it's all about being able to justify the expense to yourself so cheaper options are out there, but something with a Goretex (or similar breathable membrane) is really where it's at for keeping the rain out while still allowing any moisture from your body to escape.  For what it's worth, I also love wearing the bibs on cooler summer or fall mornings: they're 100% windproof as well?"
1011238,vance,2017-08-13 01:57:00,719,Frogs toggs are fairly good as long as you dont sit will it is raining   wet ass syndrome.
1011240,smithy97,2017-08-13 02:25:00,70,Cabelas has their gore-tex guidewear series of bibs and coats on sale right now. Look like they are worth the money
1011245,Dutch01,2017-08-13 13:29:00,1431,"I love my BPS Pro Qualifier Bib, it's truly amazing. But it's too warm for this time of year."
1011249,DanD,2017-08-13 16:30:00,2223,"You hard core guys are going to laugh at this; but for 75 bucks, Canadian Tire's wetskins have worked very well for me. I use the jacket all the time, as a wind breaker; the inner liner allows it to breath; so I'm not soaked from sweating. The one I'm using now is on its 6th year; other then a couple of hook catches in the pants; it's in good shape.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/wetskins-waterproof-2-pc-rainsuit-navy-0783358p.html#srp  Dan."
1011253,manitoubass2,2017-08-13 17:41:00,11391,No one seems to look at stormtech either  My suit is great and it's very affordable.
1011254,sofabed,2017-08-13 17:48:00,119,I use the brand Costco sells. I am not hard core fishing either.

1011270,zeeter,2017-08-13 23:28:00,92,The CDN Tire Wetskins suits are great for the money.  I ve also had mine for quite a few years.  They go on sale every couple months.
1011273,BillM,2017-08-14 00:37:00,17367,Frog toggs if you aren't sitting in the boat are probably your cheapest bet.
1011279,J Roelofsen,2017-08-14 02:41:00,84,Another vote for Cabelas guide wear here...  Josh
1011280,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-14 02:53:00,8243,"I just packed my Stormtech jacket and pants for a trip. It's 17 years old and looks and works like new. I don't even know if they still make them, I haven't had to replace it."
1011283,manitoubass2,2017-08-14 03:40:00,11391,"My ol man distributes for them.  So if anyone wants, i can hook up a great cost  The gear is great, but OI would you agree the jackets fit small?  My large pants fit great, but my jacket at xl was too small. Mind you im fat  But I had to go xxl"
1011293,jimmer,2017-08-14 15:14:00,2730,The wetskin from Canadian Tire is a good one for occasional use.  I did the research when I was looking and just could bring myself to purchasing the more expensive brands for what I do.
1011294,GBW,2017-08-14 15:30:00,8460,"The wetskin for Canadian Tire is a good one for occasional use.  I did the research when I was looking and just could bring myself to purchasing the more expensive brands for what I do. I too have the same one's, one set at home one set at my folks cottage.  For the price they do what I need.  Yeah sitting you will get wet but still better than nothing"
1011331,gordy28,2017-08-15 01:26:00,638,"I had an old wetskins that was a hand me down for a few years.  Was great for keeping dry and for a day of fishing When we started doing week long trips I found it very hot and uncomfortable over the course of a week and not very warm on cold rainy days so I upgraded to a bass pro pro qualifier suit.  I love it, and it's much more comfortable than the wetskins but it was also about 6 times the price lol So I think it depends on your needs.  On our trips you've paid a lot of money to fish so sitting in the cabin isn't an option but for a day trip here and there is didn't mind the wetskins.  One big pita on my wetskins was no zipper on the bibs   make sure you have a zipper. Cheers Gordy"
1011334,chris.brock,2017-08-15 02:39:00,4053," The OP said he wanted a not too expensive suit, I don't know why you guys are talking 100 mph and Guidewear.  I have an older Wetskins suit from Costco (I think it was $50) and for the money it's been great. I use the pants even when it's not raining to break the wind when it's fairly cold."
1011335,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-15 04:07:00,10439,What are those suits that Charlie Wray flogs on his show like? I believe they sell them at Sail.
1011337,loadie933,2017-08-15 10:21:00,11,"Charlie Wray wears ""Viking"" rain gear.  I have the tempest II jacket and pants.  I never did find them at Sail.  Got them at Marks Work Warehouse.   Not as expensive as the Bass Pro or the Cabella's gear.  Good quality."
1011345,woodenboater,2017-08-15 12:47:00,2277,...use the pants even when it's not raining to break the wind when it's fairly cold.   sorry but the twelve year old in me was thinking like beavis and butthead lol
1011350,boombap,2017-08-15 14:17:00,310,I use a frogg toggs anura jacket.. really nice for the money.
1011359,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-15 15:33:00,273,"Mark's has the Windriver rain pants on sale for $25 at the moment.  But I think it expires in a day or two!  But even when not on sale, they are only $35 and the nice Helly Hansen rain pants are $45 @ Mark's.  They are nice and well reviewed (both Mark's site and Amazon.ca)  They have matching jackets."
1011448,limeyangler,2017-08-16 16:17:00,5204,"I bought the guidewear bibs and jacket, it's the lightweight one so good for summer and enough room to put over layers in the fall. They were a lot of money for me but I won't say expensive cuz they have been well worth it."
1011449,BassMan11,2017-08-16 16:25:00,583,Another vote for BPS 100MPH suit. Expensive but have never been wet... sitting or standing.
