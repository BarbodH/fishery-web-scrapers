1011778,mistaredone,2017-08-21 12:17:00,913,I'm looking for a vehicle to plow a small parking lot at my wife's business. For the past few years I've been using my Polaris Sportsman and it's been fine but I'm looking to simplify the process. I know 2500 + size trucks are ideal for plowing but I'm not going to be driving around with it all day or working the truck around the clock. It will be a 10 min job pre snowfall. The truck will be my primary vehicle all year round so I really want a 1500 size Silverado or F-150 with a light commercial blade like the Sno-way R-26 or similar. Has anyone had any experience?  I don't mind a little extra maintenance and repair but I also don't want to trash a 30k truck either

My driveway is about 22x180 with a 40x25 foot parking area, the area gas station convenience  store and the local diner were gathering places for the snow plow guys. It was pretty easy to connect with them and get some numbers to have and get my larger than normal drive plowed for 20-30 bucks, might be cheaper than beating up or buying your own?"
1011789,mistaredone,2017-08-21 14:39:00,913,I'm looking at 5k + for the contract plus $100 per salt.  I paid for my Polaris the first winter.
1011790,mistaredone,2017-08-21 14:41:00,913,The truck and plow will be a business expense but I'm eyeballing a bigger boat this spring so I'll need the truck anyways and it will be my daily driver

1011800,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-21 16:22:00,10439,I used to plow commercially with my full size Ford Bronco with an 8' Fisher plow. You'll be fine with a 1500 series and a plow.
1011801,DanD,2017-08-21 16:35:00,2223,If you're going to be driving on the streets with a plow/can opener hanging on the truck; you'd best check what your insurance will be?  Dan.
1011809,mistaredone,2017-08-21 18:44:00,913,The plow would stay on site
1011828,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-21 21:37:00,8243,I have a close friend and Bro in Law that are in the landscape/plow business have more than a few guys that use a 1/2 ton. A 1/2 ton 4X4 will be just fine if you are only doing 1 small lot. As long as it's a Silverado! Not as much bling as the other 2 but as I always say it's just a truck. I don't need coolers under the rear floors. A back up camera would be nice plowing though.
