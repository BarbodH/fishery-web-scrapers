Both sets of my Grand Parents were born in Italy, my last name is Italian, am I more apt to be in a not so secret criminal organization? Not all Italians are mobbed up and not all Asians are poachers. Why not just say Asian, would that have been more accurate and less racist than foreigner, I'm not sure, I wasn't there? This political correctness has gone to far. But our friend in Washington is changing that.  After thinking about it why not just say ""poachers""."

I understand people were leaving carcasses, but don't salmon die naturally after spawning??? LOL  I'm sure the other reasons included public urination, drinking and littering They said they were going to increase enforcement and if caught fishing, it will be a $150 fine.  I'm sure it will increase if you're doing other illegal activities. Not sure I like these kind of moves."

1011444,Garnet,2017-08-16 14:20:00,2056,The last couple years has been much better. Don't think the town has given increased enforcement enough time.  I think it's a racist thing. The locals see lot's of lesser skilled anglers show up and would like to blame them for slicing fish and dumping carcass. These lesser skilled anglers want the whole fish.  It's the skilled slob anglers that slice and dump. I've seen it over and over.

They and I, are on the same page. It is so pleasant to fish with these guys. A couple  of them are young, the rest older then I. Great stories shared , The banter of ,cloths line reels vs the coffee grinder reels, is a hoot. Fish are caught and released 90% of the time. Odd one kept for roe and yes, they eat the fish. Most of them smoke their catch and share during our gatherings. Even the share of the wealth of roe, will be shared. Not one takes more then they need.  Best bunch of fellas I have ever met. Sure glad I just walked in to stir up a chat way back.   So if the ""real issue"" is ""a length of rope with 5 gaff hooks tied to it"", why the ""focus"" on ""a family of foreigners"" ????Your post is ""offensive"". & so is FloatnFly's.Give your head another shake.   Yup  Simon, when I first moved to Barrie, I got the low down on the hot spots to fish. I also got a real good  look at the LOCALS, ripping fish out of the water. Yes LOCALS. YAHOOS. I was like, WT %$$% IS THIS. I got some real serious looks. Like, you just keep walking and never mind what we are doing. Line as thick as cloths cable, huge trebles with a bit of white yarn. Guess they thought the yarn was a safe way of saying, they are hitting it.  Knowing now what I know, they were collecting eggs to sell. This is why now all roe sold, has to be from licensed  fish farms.  It is all walk of nations, that make this crap show ruin it for those that truly enjoy the salmon season."
