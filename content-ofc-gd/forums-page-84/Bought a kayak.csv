I got a call from my wife saying that there was a big sale at Sail so I drove over to Sail in cambridge and saw one that I was looking at $200 off.  So I now have a Pelican Maverick 120. A nice 12'. I was told because of my size and because I'll be fishing from it, a 12' was necessary so I have a more stable base.  Can wait to take it out!"
