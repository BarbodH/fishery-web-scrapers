It is sad but there are places here in Ontario not just south that just isn't safe to be sometimes at 3AM, to me anyway. We have control of that, don't go there at 3AM. Safe is a state of mind sometimes, not a reality. Just because you can keep and eat a Musky doesn't mean you should."

As the old saying goes ""just because you can doesn't mean you should"".. Sadly when pandora's box was opened and allowed handguns for everyone it did not specify that only the good people would have them. I find it creates an environment that is now balanced when after a background check and a safety course a person can own and carry a pistol. Few people will walk up to a 230lb muscular guy wearing a shirt that says "" I am drunk and like to fight"" it is a visible deterrent to someone that was going to mess with him for his own pleasure,open carry does the same thing. Even more effective is not knowing IF the 150lb guy is a worse target than the big guy because he is concealed carry which makes him a 250lb guy instantly. I have found that if the belief the worst thing that can happen is a fist fight which is Not life threatening you will enter into it a lot quicker than if you have the chance of it becoming life and death. Kind of like high school and a bar fight in your local badass dive.    EXACTLY!!!! I have a couple of buddies that shoot long range competitions down in the states and they ring the bell out to 1,200 yards with them.  I have a few friends that have some beautiful works of art in the 50 caliber range. The large bullet is needed in that range to give it a flat trajectory that wind has a less effect on deviation. The charge behind it is brutal and if not held correctly or set up poorly will bruise you and feel like a mule kicked you in the shoulder. The realisation that at that range the difference on a hit and miss is less than a 1/4 inch of your chest rising and falling makes hitting the gong that much more reason to be proud of your success. The down side is it is 5-7 bucks every time you pull the trigger.  Art"
1011149,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-11 21:59:00,8243,"Thank you Art.  Again off topic a bit. When I was in Italy once a old gent that pals with my Father when they were kids I met had a Sharps hanging above the fireplace. It was sent to his father by an Uncle back in the late 1800's. It was a piece of Artwork. The cool part of the story was that we met in passing, I didn't know him or he me. He had an old King George dollar bill in his wallet he carried since the 50's when Dad sent it to him, Mr. Martini, I'll never forget him.  And you are right 40 or more pounds of muscle with a tight shirt on no one would think of bothering me. So I thought but a small guy with a small gun has a huge advantage. When in Fla. years back I was told to wear a fanny pack when out. They sold fanny pack holsters at the bait shop down the road. It has worked, so far."

Is there a point that a round will begin to tumble rather than rifle through the air? My thread, my digression.  Boat Tail ammo for less drag and turbulence, jacketed hollow point for stability, and larger calibers for momentum.

We were out on the town last night and saw a man with an AR 15 slung over his shoulder walking his dog. Just strange for us to see. It really frightened my wife to see this. It's the way it is. Off to a Riverboat Casino cruise. Should be fun, if I don't loose my shirt.

1010781,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-06 20:48:00,8243,"I have seen Dunnville change in the last few years. You can judge a place by their real estate sales. Places have doubled or more in the last year, a place may sell within 3 days for above asking. Yes the same is happening all around the GTHNA but I would never have thought that would happen in old grungy grimy Dummyville. The same thing in Cayuga is happening. Many are choosing to retire there. It's right on the river and 10 minutes from Erie by water, both hunting and fishing are still great. They are starting construction on a new Market and waterfront park by the bridge. We would have never, ever considered moving there but we would now.  It was a cesspool of crack heads 10 years ago for sure. You know what they used to say about people from Dunnville, they all have 9 teeth and 6 are in their pocket. Or, they can eat corn on the cob through a picket fence. In Dunnville when you get divorced you still love your ex because after all, your sister is still your sister."

We had a place in south Florida when the Cocaine wars were on. What I wanted to comment on was how strange it felt walking around in a public place and seeing men walking around with side arms and in 2 cases a semi-automatic weapon slung over their shoulders. People still walk Fifi in the parks. It's not a police state or in the middle of the hood.  According to Michael Moore during his film Bowling for Columbine Canadians have far more fire arms per capita than Americans, and they are the guns registered. I would double that number, not everyone handed in their guns nor do they register all the new ones with the serial numbers missing."

1010959,aplumma,2017-08-09 15:05:00,6896,funny how u let some political threads slide. dont mention a pontoon boat though Some threads are doomed from the beginning due to the negative wording and subject matter. This thread has not gone wrong and I have not had to watch it. Many may know I run a plumbing company and a farm along with family matters. This keeps me busy and I usually have a limited amount of time to read the threads and make corrections when they go wrong. It is easy for people who have more time than me to not see why I am not here all the time to moderate all of the threads. If I stick to the rules tightly then many threads would be dead on arrival. When I do go out on a limb and let the ones that are edgy run people complain. The easy path would be to shut a lot of them down but when I take the harder path people complain. So if I am going to listen to people complain either way why am I taking the hard  path? I think the board is pretty liberal on what you are allowed to discuss it is very rare that I get people P.M.ing me with bent feelings. If you want a board that allows free for alls I am sure it is somewhere on the internet but it is not here. If a thread is locked and you want to know why then feel free to ask me as a P.M. I will gladly give you my reasoning.  Cheers  Art
