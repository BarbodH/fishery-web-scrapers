When I re- installed the unit ,I cant get any power. I have double checked that the power cable has been connected properly. Any ideas ? Thanks"
1011303,Sinker,2017-08-14 19:45:00,8692,Fuse good?
1011312,Terry,2017-08-14 21:13:00,14456,Fuse or dirty connectors
1011313,misfish,2017-08-14 21:33:00,29133,Broken peg or pegs in the connector plug. Corrosion.

1011341,msp,2017-08-15 11:57:00,1336,I got it figured out. I put the unit in the front to see if it was the unit. Power came on. Traced the wires back to the battery and found a blown fuse and bad connections to the battery. Cleaned the terminals and replaced the fuse. Thanks guys
