1011849,Beans,2017-08-22 14:09:00,3339,"Many years ago, I used to take my grandson's mom and uncle fishing...then I used to take him fishing.  Yesterday he took me fishing on Sturgeon Lake on a rented pontoon...Would have been nice if we caught some bigger fish but we did manage a half dozon or so 1 pound smallies...  Next week he will be taking my great-grandson fishing at the same place...      I guess that is what you call payback !"
1011852,DanD,2017-08-22 14:26:00,2223,Good stuff!!!  Dan.
1011853,GBW,2017-08-22 14:28:00,8460,that's great you got out with family
1011855,Big Cliff,2017-08-22 15:09:00,6899,"  Glad to see you got out my friend, there are no better times to be had than fishing with family!"
1011856,Sinker,2017-08-22 15:11:00,8692,"Full circle, Beans! Good stuff!"
1011862,Hank Jr,2017-08-22 16:44:00,146,Great report sounds like a great time . I'm going through the same thing helped one of my grandsons catch his first Muskie last year this year getting ready to take my great grand kids bobber fishing for bluegills .
1011866,Moosebunk,2017-08-22 18:30:00,3970,"Can only hope others will do the same for all of us, in our futures.  Nice!"
1011869,Loonietoon,2017-08-22 18:46:00,1450,Good for him and you Norm...
1011875,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-22 19:54:00,8243,"Excellent dear Sir. Like Moosebunk said I hope to have someone to do the same for me, soon. I took a 40 something year young with me for 3 days fishing, I'm grooming him to be my guy, I hope. I showed him how to clean a fish and he cleaned all the fish for us old timers and did a great job. A great start.  By the way were you able to stay dry out in the boat?"
1011881,misfish,2017-08-22 21:33:00,29133,"Bye dat jeeperz bye, you havent changed a bit. Still looking like that cool cat I met so many years ago. Nice to see ya out and aboat, No, I spelt that right daddyooooo.  "
1011882,Rich Clemens,2017-08-22 21:46:00,3131,Best fishing times there are.  Make the memories
1011887,Beans,2017-08-22 22:04:00,3339, By the way were you able to stay dry out in the boat   Funny you should ask...there was quite a bit of spray when we were underway...my jeans were soaked at the back but I wrote that off as sweat but I guess the spray was running down the back of the seat...LOL   Just realized that you might be referring to the incident I had with Albert on Sturgeon...But yes...I managed to stay in the boat...LOL
1011925,AKRISONER,2017-08-23 12:27:00,5558,you could catch nothing and its still worth going out.
1011926,Beans,2017-08-23 13:10:00,3339,you could catch nothing and its still worth going out.  You're right...the fish are a bonus !
