1011416,Pikeslayer,2017-08-16 00:08:00,1443,"I posted a few weeks back looking for an outboard manual. I ended up getting the screen shot I needed (thx to Big Cliff & BC Jr) but I continued my quest to obtain the entire manual for '91 Merc 115. So after continued & dogged determination, I found the following site deep in my google search results and happy to share with everyone here.  The site: http://boatinfo.no/lib/library.html  The facts: - Original OEM service manuals in their entirety - Owners manuals & marketing manuals as well - No sketchy registration required - NO COST  except for cost of printing - Does not work on mobile devices. You'll need to acces via desk/laptop - Download & print max 25 pages at a time - Print to PDF to save $$ but still restricted to 25 page limit - All major OEMs available for HP & years back to 50s/60s through current (I think?)  I am a happy owner of a 379 page printed & bound manual @ zero cost  :) Printing & binding was no cost as a major printer OEM is a client of mine  Cheers"
