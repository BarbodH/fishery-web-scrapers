I hadn't paddled a kayak in 20 years but it was like riding a bike.  I had a bit of success and caught 2 snot rockets. One was about 18"" and the other was 16"".  Not a bad day  http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/GraphingAddict/98A6E58B-5455-478B-BE8D-0A9E49FD9E71_zpsaaiw6unq.jpg  http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/GraphingAddict/A31D0ECC-0743-469A-9025-109EC09171AC_zpssbwr4jky.jpg"
