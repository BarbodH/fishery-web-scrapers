I get more nervous when I have to bring a vehicle in with something I can't do, than when I get result from a medical test. No disrespect to the licenced guys on this forum, just had way to many bad experiences over the years. Oh, I also won a battle with a dealership in the 80's when I did my own oil changes and the release bearing went in my manual transmission.  They didn't want to honour the warranty, because there was no record of oil changes with them.  I just stood up to them and they honoured it, but what about the others that don't stand up to the dealer.  This is what really gets me. I also wish that Dan would move his business east of Toronto and into the Kawarthas!"
1010899,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-08 20:57:00,8243,"Toyota has always been a great manufacturer. Dad had a early 70's Corolla, he drove it in and out of the plant everyday. If he was on nights I drove it to school, once it was in the driveway I drove it. I got it in grade 11 for a good price. When I git my own car my brother bought it, he sold it to the youngest brother a few years latter. We kicked the bejeezus out that thing, you just couldn't kill it. I looked at a new Tundra when I bought the Chevy 4x4. It was 20 grand more, that's a big chunk of change. I think they can afford to throw a few freebees in at the dealership.  We complain about the bad service guys. I highly recommend Mike, Tyson and the crew at CALEDONIA TIRE on Argyle St. in Caledonia Ont. 10 years now and I have never had a single issue with them. My wife's 07' Nissan Altima just turned 330,000 KMS. It runs and looks like a 2 year old car, they have serviced it since it since 08'.  I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop when dealing with shops. I have never done my own work. I leave it to the experts. Every time in the last 45 years of destroying nice vehicles in my experience it's ""Pay me now, or pay me latter."" It seemed I would find a good place and the next thing I knew I was getting the shaft, or a wire repaired on an alternator and they paint my old one and charge me for a rebuilt for only 1 example.  If you are in our area or south Hamilton give Caledonia Tire a try. I think they have a shuttle service now for Hamilton."

My vehicles go in to our local shop at least 2 to 3 times per year either for an inspection or some work I won't mess with.  I have no complaint paying someone for skills beyond my reach, but I enjoy doing my own basic maintenance and save some bucks as well.    To each their own!"

Right on the money!  We have a shop here in Lindsay, John's Quality Auto that seems to operate on the same principals. They have a wonderful reputation for being fair and honest. When we moved South of town last year I wanted a shop that was closer to home and after reading a lot of very positive reviews I decided to give them a try, they have earned their reputation!!!!!  Just one example:  I was busy with work so I asked Sue to take my Nissan in and have them give it a check over before I left on my fishing trip in June. I just wanted them to make sure there were no issues with belts, hoses.......When she went back to pick it up and asked for the bill they told her there were no problems and it was no charge!  There are some wonderful places out there, you can usually tell who they are, they don't need to advertise, they are always busy, and they seem to have a very low employee turn over."

I found out the hard way.. Plus it gives me a chance to have a look under the vehicle.. I wouldn't have spotted the transmission leak in my wife's car before the warranty ran out. Took us a year and a half to get it properly fixed but only after we went to a different dealership where it was diagnosed right away.. I sometimes wonder why certain dealers hate doing warranty work.?? . We will be talking to GM Canada about our experience on this since they like to track the good and bad dealerships..

They have some high school kid doing it for them at minimum wages and you might be his first customer ever....think about that for a while.  I have NEVER had anyone do a oil change on any of my vehicle, all done by me and I was NEVER was refused warranty work by any manufacture.

I will also do my own after the 175,000 KM warranty is up. If you have it done from someone that isn't qualified according to GM, Ford or whoever you void your warranty."
1010664,BillM,2017-08-05 14:53:00,17367,I'd love to see GM or Ford deny a warranty claim because you changed your own oil   Nothing but a PR stunt to get you in for service (Which is where they make their $$$)
1010667,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-05 15:35:00,8243,"They have few more lawyers than we do Bill, they win. Buddy next door has his motor blow on his mid life crissis Camaro 6 months new. He had to fight to get them to honor the warranty. They claimed he didn't break it in right, on board computer showed high RPM's before 10,000 km or some stupid thing."
1010669,Garnet,2017-08-05 15:49:00,2056,"If you are buying new GM you should be negotiating in exacter oil changes, the most I've got is 6. Couple hats maybe a jacket or a shirt. That's why those sales rep are wearing those shirts.  I go to jiffy lube an pull the hood and get and watch buddy take off the filter and watch the new one being installed. I can see buddy go get the synthetic. If buddy says you need a new plug and washer it's no charge Jiffy lube did it.  I did plenty oil changes I just don't do them anymore. I've also showed my wife the process. She was mad in the beginning but takes great pleasure in knowing how to check level ect now."
