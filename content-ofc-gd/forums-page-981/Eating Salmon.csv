237810,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 18:18:00,7971," So if the Air Management Officer finds you breathing out of season, do they take your lungs?  Watch out for those exceptions in your zone!"
237811,Rich,2008-08-08 18:20:00,3927,I hear in some of the states breathing is open year-round!
237829,highdrifter,2008-08-08 19:40:00,2534," Holly Shnikes I hope you didn't pull those fish from the harbour.  Not only are the ressources limited, but the accumulative toxins would be high in the larger fish.  I'm talking HARD metals here man.  I can only think of one time of the year where the flesh of these fish would be eadible, and that's at ice out, when the fish are about to spawn.  I understand that the law allows to keep them, but from the harbour, I'd let them go!  dang I'm feeling queezy just thinking about it.  HD"
237835,bushart,2008-08-08 20:19:00,2628,Back to the breathing licence.................I heard the breathing conservation licence is half price but your only allowed to exhale..  Bushart
237836,cplummer,2008-08-08 20:24:00,165,no wayyy   where????????
237837,tibbs,2008-08-08 20:26:00,650,You can also breath south of the Cn tracks all year!
237842,Rich,2008-08-08 20:36:00,3927,Yeah but who'd want to?
237896,fishindevil,2008-08-09 00:07:00,6254,"Well our member musky & specks said it all,earlier on in the season the fish are so firm& silver,and in perfect health,but as they prepare to spawn,man they turn black,and are already starting to rot,and to decay !!!! the meat goes mushy and they taste like crap,but a nice silver 8lb chinook or coho,or even a nice rainbow,taste really good,i have cooked many up for lots of customers,when i was on the charter boats,and everybody thought they were so good,they all thought the same about eating a fish from lake ontario till they tried a nice silver medium sized fish !!!! so it does depend on when you eat the fish as well as what size too !!!  cheers"
237934,Clampet,2008-08-09 01:32:00,1947,
237978,John Bacon,2008-08-09 03:44:00,3277," Actually, that depends on they types of contaniments that are present in the fish.  Organic compounds such as dioxins, pesticides, etc. do tend to accumulate in the fatty tissue.  Avoiding the high fat belly area of the fish will reduce your exposure to these contaniments.  Heavy metals such as mercury accumulate in the flesh.  Cutting the bellies off won't help if mercury is an issue."
237981,yo_guy,2008-08-09 04:27:00,111,Here's another one for yall... how about drinking tap water?  I heard the best time of the year to drink tap water is early spring? LOL
238037,Canuck,2008-08-09 13:22:00,491,"I used to keep my boat in Bronte and fished Lake O.  Its up on GBay now.  I found the Salmon in Lake O did taste different from the store bought spring/kings and also from the GBay versions.  I attribute it to a diet of mostly alewife in Lake O vs mostly smelt in GBay.  I didn't find them bad, just not the same.  I only kept small ones though.  I kept a 30lb one I caught in the Tournament once.  Kept the big fillets in the freezer for two years before I tossed them.  Could never bring myself to eat it.  My daughter who spent most Saturdays from age 5 to 9 on Lake O with me, always called Salmon ""two-meal-a-month-fish"" because I had to explain why we never kept the big ones we caught.  It'll probably stay with her for life."
238190,Billy Bob,2008-08-10 01:24:00,5865,"RED MEAT is MUCH more dangerous than any fish from Lake Ontario or Erie.  As I have pointed out once before, there is no Great Lakes lobbyist to ward off these Bull reports.  How many people do you know that died from eating fish from ANYWHERE. However, there are THOUSANDS that suffer from harding of the arteries, heart disease, strokes and heart attacks from eating red meat. BUT there are NO warning labels on the meat you purchase.  Good point about the drinking the water.  What about the precipitation that come off the Great Lakes and feeds our farms and gardens.  Again, not in the good interest in the government to warn you about that Bull.  Eat all the fish you want, you will probably live longer than those who SMOKE, drink and do drugs"
238195,Tacklebuster,2008-08-10 01:35:00,303,"Every now and then I trick myself into believing that the small ones are going to taste good.  Especially in the spring when the water is nice and cold, because for some reason they should be less contaminated and should taste better.  So last year I reminded myself why I never keep anything I catch out of L.O.....they simply taste like crap.   I just had a small laker from Simcoe that I cooked on the BBQ, and it was fantastic.   The summer is the worst time to eat any trout or salmon out of L.O. becuase of the flees.   Anyone who has had them on there line know the smell, and it gets into the meat, Nasty is all I can say.  Have fun catching them, but throw them back its not worth the trouble.  I would be interested in hearing about how the trout taste from GB or Huron."
238198,Billy Bob,2008-08-10 01:44:00,5865,You are not tasting any contaminates but rather the forage they are feeding on as you pointed out yourself.  Any large trout and salmon caught on the Great Lakes make great smoking fish   I will take all you have to offer
238233,Greencoachdog,2008-08-10 10:32:00,8163,  Uh... isn't that how predatory fish become contaminated?... by eating contaminated forage???     Keep on eating them... but when you start to glow in the dark... back off just a tad eh!
238251,Spiel,2008-08-10 12:56:00,9065,....What would be the synergistic effect of eating Lake Ontario salmon with Grand River walleye? Just out of curiosity.
238273,Canuck,2008-08-10 13:41:00,491,"GBay Rainbow Trout taste great.  Even the lakers are great when they are small. The larger lakers are the same as anywhere, a bit oily, but that makes them better for the smoker.  GBay salmon are fantastic to eat.  They have much less of an oily/fishy taste compared even to the Farmed Atlantics that the grocery stores have. Its too bad they are not looking like they will be around for long in GBay."
237651,Cudz,2008-08-08 12:09:00,2652,I see people keep the salmon from Lake O. How safe are they to eat?  Can you eat on specific sized fish?
237652,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 12:14:00,7971,"Here's the guide to eating sport fish for Lake Ontario.  It's done by location, size and number of meals per month that is deemed safe.  http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/publications/590b13-LO.pdf"
237657,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 12:29:00,8163," Thanks for posting that Cliff, I've wondered about how safe they are too.  The way they do the consumption advisories by meals per month, pregnant women, and developing children kind of creeps me out... I guess older men can eat them because we're tougher... or they're trying to kill us off???"
237663,bushart,2008-08-08 12:44:00,2628,I think there's a footnote under atlantic salmon say under 24 inches...  Not how many you can eat but how fast  Just kiddin boys and girls---always obey the law and listen to your mom and dad and make sure you major in biology to tell your salmonoids apart.  OK I'll stop now  Bushart
237682,ketchenany,2008-08-08 13:42:00,3229,"CCMT I do that book and it's a 'PITA' to do, but information is good, the next one may really get hacked with some new studies they have done. Happy reading!"
237684,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 13:57:00,8163,It makes me wonder... if you're only supposed to eat 2 meals a month of a certain species from a certain area... is it really good to eat that fish at all?
237687,danbo,2008-08-08 14:04:00,2646,You should always cut-off the belly strips. The fatty areas is where the toxins accumulate. Grilling lets the fat drip off too.
237689,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 14:13:00,8163,  You forgot to mention that you should eat smaller (younger) fish because toxins are cumulative.
237691,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 14:16:00,7971," I know what you mean Glen.  I grew up in the 70s on Lake Ontario.  I still remember the warnings NOT to eat ANY fish from Lake Ontario due to contamination.  I know that the health of the lake has improved by leaps and bounds, but I still cant bring myself to eat anything from it.  What I dont quite understand is if you eat multiple species of fish.  So, if it says I can eat 2 meals of Salmon, and 4 Walleye, what can I eat per month?  One Salmon and 2 Walleye?  Maybe ketchenany can answer that for us!"
237693,danbo,2008-08-08 14:17:00,2646,"Yep, but I only catch bigguns when I go!  I've noticed a lot of Quinte Walleyes with ""growths"" on their face, yet guys eat them! Yuck..I'd rather throw a Shaker Chinny on the barbi myself.."
237702,smbhunter,2008-08-08 14:26:00,186,"I tried a salmon from a lake ontario trib a few years back, (can't remember if was from bowmanville or wilmot), that was a nice silver 4-5 lbs fish. I figured if I was going to try one, I'd try a smaller one for better taste and quality. Boy was I wrong. I swear I could taste the chemical in that fish. I'm not sure if this was an isolated bad fish or not, but I never tried another salmon since. I've had mixed results with rainbow up to about 3 lbs from lake o, but if I want a fish to eat, I'll hit a gbay trib and get me a very tastey trout or salmon up to 5 lbs."
237706,danbo,2008-08-08 14:30:00,2646,Lake O fish are mushy & pale looking meat.
237708,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 14:31:00,8163, What're you doing with a shaker Chinny if you only catch big ones???
237711,bushart,2008-08-08 14:38:00,2628,I'm thinkin the shakers are used for bait to catch the big ones  Bushart
237713,ketchenany,2008-08-08 14:47:00,3229,  If you read the upfront section starting at page 2 of the book it goes into detail regarding consumption etc.  Hope this helps
237716,ccmtcanada,2008-08-08 14:52:00,7971, That's a nice way of telling me to read the book...LOL.  Thanks for the tip!

237723,Greencoachdog,2008-08-08 15:13:00,8163,  Read it and tell us who dies at the end Cliff.
237728,tdotfisherman,2008-08-08 15:28:00,317,"I've eaten a few Nothern Pike from Lake Ontario. They were all in perfect health, and the meat tasted amazing.. I wouldn't make it a weekly habbit, but a few a year wont kill anyone.."
237732,Musky or Specks,2008-08-08 15:36:00,2710,What they dont tell you is that the sample taken is from the shoulder of the fish which is the leanest and therefore the cleanest part of the fish. Just imagine how bad the fattier parts of the fish are. If I want to eat salmon Ill go fish Colpoys or Thompson's hole in the spring. I would never it a late summer or fall salmon. The hormonal changes that the fish quickly progress through are incredible as they get ready to spawn and die.
237758,POLLIWOGG,2008-08-08 16:23:00,835,"Go outside , take a deep breath,....when your done coughing your guts out stop worrying about what you eat. go back inside and have a few beers."
