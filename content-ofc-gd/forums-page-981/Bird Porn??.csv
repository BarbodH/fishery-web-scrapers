238123,bushart,2008-08-09 20:56:00,2628,Was out anglin today and seen this fellow sitting on a tree-----This probably should go in photography but in all my years have never seen a white one--this is in Ottawa Valley---anyone ever seen this?    Bushart
238124,bushart,2008-08-09 20:58:00,2628,  Bushart
238125,JohnF,2008-08-09 20:59:00,3494, Gotta check my books but that guy looks like he made a wrong turn whilst flying around Florida. Is this what global warming is doing?  JF
238128,Leecher,2008-08-09 21:06:00,7832,Never seen a completely white one before bushart..... they are usually greyish. Great shot.... truly a beauty  Thanks for sharing Leechman
238137,Joey,2008-08-09 21:45:00,9122,"There's a white one that lives in a marsh on the 407 as we travel from South to home.  I wish I could get a pic, but have not been able to yet.  Great pic.  Joey"
238139,JohnF,2008-08-09 21:48:00,3494,"Looks to me like a Great Egret (darkish legs, orange bill). This area is a tad outside it's normal range but not too far off.  JF"
238140,fishing n autograph,2008-08-09 21:48:00,2540,i do believe it's a great egret
238142,4thgen,2008-08-09 21:49:00,157,Looks like a Great Egret Ardea alba to me. They occur fairly regularly in Southern Ontario but cool to see.
238148,Greencoachdog,2008-08-09 21:58:00,8163,Looks like supper to me!!! mmmmmmmmmmm Great Egret!!!   I wonder if they ever get hit by cars???
238159,Leecher,2008-08-09 22:53:00,7832, Do you seriously eat those??
238163,bushart,2008-08-09 22:58:00,2628,"Thanks guys---I was guessin it was an albino heron lookin for a shrimp dinner.  My Dad has been gone a long time now but I think I remember him telling me about people eating some kind of crane---not sure though--we're talking my memory from the 60's (just a kid, not what you think)  Bushart"
238164,Leecher,2008-08-09 23:04:00,7832, Thanks Bushart for the info
238166,Greencoachdog,2008-08-09 23:12:00,8163,"    nah, it's a running joke on the board that I'm a redneck from Alabama that eats roadkill.      Those would be Sandhill Whopping Cranes and they were nearly slaughtered to extinction by people eating them... They're a protected species now."
238169,Leecher,2008-08-09 23:31:00,7832, Somehow I don't believe you G.......................  Just kidding....... I hear ya!! LM
238180,JohnF,2008-08-10 00:33:00,3494, Only when they're dead.  JF
238223,Leecher,2008-08-10 03:55:00,7832, OMG....you are weird LOL LM
238230,Rich,2008-08-10 10:15:00,3927,Egret. Sugarpacket and I just saw one the other day while we were carp fishing.
238231,Greencoachdog,2008-08-10 10:17:00,8163, The first rule of eating road kill is that it still has to be wiggling when you pick it up!!!
238282,JohnF,2008-08-10 14:02:00,3494, I suppose just being warm doesn't mean much down yer way.  JF
238303,Carp,2008-08-10 14:48:00,1488,  .......and here I was thinking rednecks don't care if their meat is fresh.
238311,JohnF,2008-08-10 15:06:00,3494, They're just practical. Roadkill is already tenderized. Ya just gotta ignore the tiretread pattern.  JF
238313,Roy,2008-08-10 15:13:00,13728,I was in the south and couldn't understand why some roadkill was so expensive.....then I found a Mercedes hood ornament in my roast.
238322,JohnF,2008-08-10 15:38:00,3494, They hang the better pieces like that. A 3 hour trip on a hot highway with lots of diesels in front does wonders for pre-tenderized baby possum.  JF
238330,jwl,2008-08-10 16:40:00,1056,"looks like a Snowy Egret, in the late spring there are lots of them around my neck of the woods....see 5-6 of them every year in Black Creek off the QEW, and lots of them out on the Upper Niagara by Navy Island.  I think they migrate and  nest in those spots, pretty cool you got a shot of one with a Heron"
