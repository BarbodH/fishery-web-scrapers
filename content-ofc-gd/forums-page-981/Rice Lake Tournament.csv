238029,canadian_copper,2008-08-09 12:44:00,925,can ya post a start and finish time bro
238042,Stoty,2008-08-09 13:39:00,2910,Sorry about that! Its now posted on the site  7am - 2pm
238071,Bass Tard,2008-08-09 15:27:00,128,"I might be up for this, I just have to see if the girlfriend is up for camping that weekend!  (too poor for a cottage)"
238080,Roy,2008-08-09 15:53:00,13728,Dang! That would be fun...I'll be at Lakair that weekend :-(
238150,Stoty,2008-08-09 22:11:00,2910,"Don't worry Roy, there's always next year! If this year is a success, then I will for sure organize another for next year!"
238182,GoneFishin,2008-08-10 00:59:00,349,Any exceptions for boats of 4? I might be able to talk my girlfriend and her parents into registering. They aren't into competitive fishing but I'm dieing to join a little touney and they are usually on love sick lake so I could probably be able to get there with them.
238227,gone_fishin,2008-08-10 06:01:00,481,i'm gonna try my damndest to get the day off work and find a partner with a boat... hahaha  i've got some smallies out of rice topping 6lbs in the past... i'd love to get out there for a mini-tourney like this...
238239,Stoty,2008-08-10 11:59:00,2910,"Forgot to tell you all, tournament rules are you must share your best spots with me (especially with smallies over 6lbs), in order to register for the tourny!!  "

238425,Stoty,2008-08-10 21:55:00,2910,"Just an update:  There are 7 boats registered so far, which means only 13 spots remain. There are only 2 rental boats remaining. Registration and rental boats are first come, first serve.  www.stoty.com/tournament"
238450,vance,2008-08-10 23:24:00,719,We are registered but it might be A GOOD IDEA to start a new thread about the tournament so that everyone knows that it is a go.   vance
238451,PatrickGG,2008-08-10 23:29:00,562,"Count me in, Maybe the mods should Pin this thread??"
238457,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-11 00:01:00,0,WHOA!!!!Live bait permitted???Maybe someone should organize another tournament with no live bait.....
238474,Stoty,2008-08-11 00:43:00,2910,"This is just a ""fun"" tournament, with anglers of all skill levels. So yes live bait is permitted."
238481,PatrickGG,2008-08-11 00:54:00,562,"Live Bait, Forget about it, count me out."
238483,Stoty,2008-08-11 00:57:00,2910,Patrick....did you already register via the website?
238596,duber,2008-08-11 13:18:00,220,Would love to be in your tourny but thats opening weekend for ducks.Next year the weekend before or after and I'll be in for sure.Good luck to all.
238611,misfish,2008-08-11 13:42:00,29133,just seen the other thread. Good call.
237562,Stoty,2008-08-08 02:12:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  My buddy and I are thinking about holding a small Bass tournament on Rice Lake in September and were wondering if anyone would be interested in fishing it?  $15/team winners take all. 3 Bass limit  Preferably have your own boat, but not recommended.  Its nothing serious or anything, just an excuse to get out of the house and enjoy a days fishing.  PM me if you're interested or want more info.  Cheers, *Jamie"
237625,gone_fishin,2008-08-08 05:31:00,481,I'm on Rice the weekend after labour day...  i just sent you details... check your PMs
237656,evster,2008-08-08 12:22:00,367,I'd be up for it if I could find a partner (with a boat).
237670,Stoty,2008-08-08 12:55:00,2910,"I talked to my buddy and if the tournament is to happen, it will be Saturday, September 20."
237683,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-08 13:52:00,0,"I may be interested but we will see(its too early now). I wanted to join a bass club and do some tournaments but I talked to the club leader and wasn't impressed to say the least.  Would like the feel of competitive bass fishing. I don't know Rice lake that well and I don't expect to win, but I like the pressure!!And the price is right.Sounds like fun.  Post it again a week before.  Maybe OFC should start its own Bass Club. And have Tournaments."
237715,muskymike,2008-08-08 14:51:00,772," Johnny, that actually sounds like a good idea. The planning and prep work would be tremendous for those willing to undertake it, but I think the turn out would be good. I am not a huge Bass guy anymore either, but it would be fun to participate in something like that."
237722,Dutch,2008-08-08 15:12:00,831,"Hey - fun tournaments would be great - $20-$30/boat is a good price and gets the competitive juices flowing.  As for Rice - don't think I have anything on that week in September, so it may work out."
237729,Stoty,2008-08-08 15:30:00,2910,"Sweet!  I am working on a little website for the tourny, which will have all the details. It should be a good day for sure! I will post the link once the sites done.  Thanks for the responses guys!  *Jamie"
237731,mikeh,2008-08-08 15:36:00,824,"sounds like fun, $15-20 for a team entry, depending how many teams, maybe have 3 payouts, that would help people at least pay for the gas in there boats and vehicles for a day."
237742,Rich,2008-08-08 15:58:00,3927,"Planned on taking that weekend off for a kawartha trip anyway. Will be in the area, so I'll probably be at the tourney!"
237755,Stoty,2008-08-08 16:08:00,2910,"Awesome, sounds good guys.  If we get a good turn out this year, we would like to make it an annual thing."
237756,cranks bait,2008-08-08 16:09:00,721,Ah man.  I wish there were more tournies that happened on Sundays.  I won't be able to make it.  Rice is however just down the road from the inlaws so it is a great spot for me to go to.  Sounds like a lot of fun.
237760,e-z-out,2008-08-08 16:30:00,1052,count me and my buddy in for that weekend.
237774,Fang,2008-08-08 17:12:00,1330,"Keep this post alive with update info, sounds like a great excuse to dust the old tournament gear off. It's been 10 years since my last one and Rice was one of my fav lakes.  Bewdley launch??"
237784,cpguy29,2008-08-08 17:26:00,148,Sounds like fun. I just need someone to tow my boat there.
237824,trophyfish,2008-08-08 19:18:00,16,I am in. Please post final details. Matt
237826,mbac31,2008-08-08 19:25:00,904,I'm in for it as well.

237867,vance,2008-08-08 22:08:00,719,Definite maybe for at least one boat or  two.  vance
237906,misfish,2008-08-09 00:32:00,29133,"If theres a boater,that needs a non for this,Im game. Keep this thread alive"

238014,brickNblock,2008-08-09 11:38:00,598,"Stoty, Are you considering the 27-28th..of Sept. If so, you can pencil us in at the moment provided we survive the Stoney Lake Combo the week before without any propbs witht teh boat."
238016,Stoty,2008-08-09 12:00:00,2910,"It will be September 20. Most likely out of Gores Landing as of right now. Just finalizing the details, and will post them soon."
238026,Stoty,2008-08-09 12:36:00,2910,"Ok guys, I believe we are good to go with the tournament.  For the final details and to register for the tournament, please go to www.stoty.com/tournament.
