238353,John Bacon,2008-08-10 18:43:00,3277,I am interested in the Transducer Mounting Plates from Cabela's.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...=4887&Nty=1  Has anybody ever seen these for sale in Canada; preferably in the Eastern GTA?  I would prefer to purchase from a store here rather than order.  I would also consider a Portable Transducer Bracket.  I have never seen these sold in Canada either.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...=4887&Nty=1    
238359,Fisherman,2008-08-10 18:59:00,7201,"I'm pretty sure Lebaron has them, maybe BPro too. Check this: http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp08/fishing/tite_lok.pdf  The board may also be available there, some call it Kingboard, special laminate, maybe at West Marine, bring lots of money to that place.  Bass Pro also has the mount: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_200-1-6"
238360,Guest lundboy,2008-08-10 18:59:00,0,Some boats come with them already install now.  You can just go buy a kitchen plastic cutting board and is will work too.  Just be sure to get a thick one.  Did you try West Marine?  http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/store...;section=stores  Or  http://www.boatingstore.com/ca/RobinsonMar...late-c2132.html
238519,John Bacon,2008-08-11 02:45:00,3277,Thank for the replies.  I will try a couple of these places this week.
238536,forrest,2008-08-11 05:55:00,1032,"List of places that do not have transducer mounting plates:  Lebarons Bass Pro (Canada) Gagnons Tightline   Cabelas does have them, a marine shop might have them. Most guys are saying: go to Canadian Tire they cutting boards...$10 not on sale.  I build a brace, but the brace does not work when doing more than 15mph.  forrest"
