238862,forrest,2008-08-12 01:22:00,1032,IF the storms let up I am planning on a Scugog evening fish and figure that lake drainage/filling is going to play a factor.  I am guessing that it flows in from North and North East of Ceserea and flows out where by Highway 7/canals.  OR  should I just wait a few more days?  forrest
