237697,misfish,2008-08-08 14:21:00,29133,"Not sure if this is true,can anyone here confirm this?"
237737,Guest gbfisher,2008-08-08 15:47:00,0,I think it will happen on all lakes before long but I dont know if it is true on Six Mile.....
237750,Musky or Specks,2008-08-08 16:03:00,2710,Call the local MNR. Thats what you should do whenever there is a question about regs cause only they can give you the proper answer.
237764,cram,2008-08-08 16:48:00,1733,"likely easier to just get non-lead at your local store then to get an MNR person on the phone.  Besides, using something other than lead is a good thing."
237782,Cudz,2008-08-08 17:22:00,2652,good luck finding spinnerbaits with no lead
237801,steverowbotham,2008-08-08 17:58:00,1800,"tungsten spinnerbaits are pretty popular now.  Most lead bans are for lead under a certain size, such as split shot.  But I cannot confirm six mile's lead ban"
237806,Musky or Specks,2008-08-08 18:01:00,2710,Call during business hours there is always someone in the office who can answer these questions.
237809,cram,2008-08-08 18:13:00,1733,"Am not positive but i think lead bans apply to sinkers, not lures.  Loons ingest split shot but not likely to ingest spinner baits etc."
237812,steverowbotham,2008-08-08 18:24:00,1800," Not just loons, but waterfowl in general.  Ducks and geese ingest small pebbles to help with digestion.  Small split shot just happen to be about the right size."
237813,Fisherman,2008-08-08 18:34:00,7201,"Yes, waterfowl ingest small pebbles to aid in digestion(no teeth), but I don't think they're ramming 1/8 and 1/4 oz split shot down their throat.  Then again, unless you're fishing in a foot or two of water and lose some split shot, maybe it's a good story.  I haven't seen any fowl with scuba tanks and masks going diving for lead lately.   One of those flawed ""government studies"" finally admitted the death rate caused by ingestion was a lot lower than previously reported."
237817,camillj,2008-08-08 19:06:00,1988,I once saw a loon come up with a minnow off bottom (on a fishing line) in almost 20' of water ...the Loon escaped unharmed... but you'd be surprised how deep they dive.  And I believe the issue is that dead birds keep showing up with lead shot in their belly and signs that lead poisoning was the cause of death ... thats the kind of thing that gets everyone upset.
238469,cram,2008-08-11 00:28:00,1733," I have no idea about the toxicity of lead, but many birds (like loons) dive quite deep."
