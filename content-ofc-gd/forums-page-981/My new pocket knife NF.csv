238174,ChrisK,2008-08-10 00:10:00,2772,"Not a pocket knife but a custom made knife with grip constructed with antler that was deformed from a buck my buddy shot.  Definetely one of my favourites in my collection. This knife also showed up in the""Guns and Amo"" magazine about 10 years ago I figure may be more...  Cheers !!!"

238317,outdoorguy61,2008-08-10 15:21:00,220,"There are a few shows where Ontario knife makers often have assorted knives on display. I believe a  gentleman by the name of Ron Post is one of the more prolific knife makers back home to  note. Nationally, there are two companys in the maritimes that make knives with little Pictou Nova Scotia having the most production history.  Knife collecting is of course roughly 1/10 the size of what occurs in the United States. We are such a spread out country, with some collectors of various outdoors items being far moe priveate tha our American neighbours.  I have a few knives, with my personal favourite being a Leatherman ""Clip"" or some such name, simply because it is so practical for my uses. I am now comically on my third or forth, with one being stolen at a show, one being lost and me thankfully finding this one at a retailer in western Canada. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the son of a US based friend is going to get around and make me a lovely Damascus steel type knife, that he has hinted around about over the past few years.  outdoorguy61"

237819,danbo,2008-08-08 19:10:00,2646,"Thanx RAF, I wonder why there's so little interest in knife-collecting here?"
237822,douG,2008-08-08 19:13:00,2693,"I've got four or five knives, Danbo.  I don't think of myself as a collector, tho.  Your new one is a beauty for sure."

237911,danbo,2008-08-09 00:42:00,2646,I just got a couple good Buck fixed-blades recently..The Simonich Raven Legacy & the Kalinga. If you want a folder I would suggest the Cabela's offerings in S30V steel..it's that good. Otherwise LeBarons is decently priced Brian.

That Henchels is kinda cute Dan'l...  ... but if you want to peak my interest, you need to talk Case pocket knives. I call what I have my ""collection"", but to a real collector... they would consider it an accumulation.  I like to request sexy Case knives for Christmas and birthday presents. Here's a few:  Abalone handle Trapper Case   Mother of Pearl handle Whittler Case   Peacock handle Doctor with Damascus steel blade   Chestnut handle Doctors with Damascus steel blade   Texas Toothpick with Barbwire carved handle   This is a Bulldog brand Big Canoe with engraved Bluegill on the blade   Just remember... if it aint a Case, it aint crap!!!"

238090,Mattones,2008-08-09 16:51:00,587,Not so much a Pocket knife But I use this on hunting trips up north. Cuts through deer like nothing. 
238099,Leecher,2008-08-09 17:30:00,7832,Like Mattones said....not a pocket knife but hunting.... Won this beauty in a door prize draw a few years back. It's hand made and unique in design.    Use it all the time when deer hunting..... not too big and light weight. Leechman
