Then the clouds piled up, sky looked wicked funny and you could see the clouds slowly start to roate like the makings of a funnel cloud.  Then it rained like 90, and the hail started like crazy..the kids thought it was funny, my nephew was cracking up saying ""hey it's like it's snowing in the summer"" my 5 year old was amazed that it was raining ice balls"

It was july or august. Biggest storm i've seen."
