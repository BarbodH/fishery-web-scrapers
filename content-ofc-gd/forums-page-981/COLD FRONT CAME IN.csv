238345,bassfighter,2008-08-10 17:50:00,366,"The temp has been dropping, quite cool in the morning and cold at night less than 15 degrees. Constant rain and thunderstorm.  Has the Cold front been affecting your weekend fishing?  Todays weather a high of 20 degrees felt like Fall temp, some anglers are already thinking about Fall Salmon shore fishing. I am still very much into summer bass fishing.  I read the river fishing is probable more consistant than lake water fishing , with this constant change in temp, should drive the cold Blooded creatures crazy."

238382,Big Cliff,2008-08-10 19:49:00,6899,"Spent what I could of the weekend trying to put people on fish, I wasn't very successful apart from some pan fish and a few SM. The weather made it hard as every time anyone tried to get out, it would start raining again. Winds shifting all over the place and a cold front sure can make it tough.  Still had a fantastic weekend though! Catching was tough but the company was incredable."
238390,sonny,2008-08-10 20:08:00,511,It sure shut down the salmon out of bronte!
238395,Canuck2fan,2008-08-10 20:26:00,1444,"Might as well of put a closed sign on my favorite bass hole. I fished for 3 hrs to finally get one smallie yesterday. I was NOT leaving until I didn't have the reek of the white striped weasel on me..... Now, my record is still in tact. I sure earned that little fish though. Usually I have one in the first 3 casts there this year. It rained while I was there and even the rock bass stopped biting for a bit."

238426,cplummer,2008-08-10 22:17:00,165,the fish will adjust after 3-4 days of cooler temps.. on the bright side the salmon fishermen will start their chucking  of spoons as they come closer to river mouths..
238548,cpguy29,2008-08-11 10:42:00,148,"Managed to put 5 bass in the boat on Sunday. 1 smallie over 3lbs and 1 nice largie, the rest small, lake Scugog."
238587,JohnF,2008-08-11 12:58:00,3494,"Tried the very spot where Marko caught all those smb's the other day and saw nary a sign of a basslike critter. Several very large carp, and a few smaller models, cruising around me but no bass at all. That water's shallow so it's not hard to see what's there with the right glasses on. Was wading down under the bridge to try the other spot when the skies opened up. With the rains I moved above the dam to stand under a willow tree and chuck weedless worms and plastic frogs at the lily pads. Again nothing. I know there were fish out there because something rather large splashed a few times just off the lily pads.  Couldn't get out yesterday as we were celebrating my Mom's 90th birthday with about 148 other folks.  Today the temps seem to have dropped even more. I'll try to get out to see what that brings, or takes away. Of course one can't catch fewer than zero fish, can one?  JF"
238616,goodtimer,2008-08-11 13:59:00,53,"fished balsam all weekend, not much to show for...a few small bass, largest being 1.5lbs.  lost what i thought was a smaller musky, only caught a glimpse.  tough fishing."
238643,ozaibak1,2008-08-11 15:17:00,401,"Hmmm was thinking the cold front would make for a tough fishing day, however it turned out to be the best performance so far this summer! Fished Stoney lake, and boy was the bite ON!!! Hopefully will post a report on it soon..."
238679,cranks bait,2008-08-11 17:21:00,721,"Only effect it had on me is I waited till 7:30 to go out instead of 5:30.  Hadn't had enough coffee to go out in the rain that early.  I caught a bunch of fish.  Nothing huge, some four pounders mostly two.  All in all a great day on the water."
