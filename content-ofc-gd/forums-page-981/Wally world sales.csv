I picked up 6 packs of the Shamano rod wraps for 4 bucks each (2 in a pack). 3 dollar savings. If your looking for some closed face reels for the young,ns,they got the Spirix for 5 bucks. The reel seems to be well made for what it is. As for the boating thing,the seats are marked down 20 bucks,theres pumps and fuel lines, saftey kits."

238386,misfish,2008-08-10 20:03:00,29133," They seem to be like the rest. If you get 4 years out of them for the price,I cant see how you can go wrong.  Clamp-it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clamp-it.LOL"

238432,Kerry,2008-08-10 22:32:00,383,Any wally world's in your area with the seats having a green/grey motif.Here in Orillia it's just red/grey & blue/grey.There's still some here.As well the bushline fishing vests are marked down.Some as low as 12.49. Kerry
238458,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-11 00:07:00,0,Rod Wraps? Did they have lure wraps? You know... The ones that probably cost less than $1 to make and they charge you $8!!
