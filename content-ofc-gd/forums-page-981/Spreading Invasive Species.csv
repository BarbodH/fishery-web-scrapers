Some times I'll have my boat in a lake like Simcoe for a week, vacation ends....trailer home and following weekend could be a buddies cottage in Haliburtons. I like to shoot the hull, jet pump etc on my boat with hot water at do-it-yourself car wash-overkill?  I see guys pull their boats to head directly to another lake for a day trip....then read thread of Quebec lakes that charge you for a wash before allowing boats to launch.  Really curious how long even things like algae live....how much water crap like that needs. More and more wakeboats ARE adding Fat Sacs, basically a ballast system. Those boats fill ballast  after launching (increases boats wake size) then dump the water at days end. Of course not all water and whatever exits the sacs(or tanks on factory installed boats)....they smell foul. Boat then launches on another lake....and I'm worried about my bilge? Owners can run bleach through their ballast system-hard on the pump rubber seals etc."
