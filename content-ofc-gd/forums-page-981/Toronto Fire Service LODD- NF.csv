The FIRE FIGHTER'S PRAYER When I am called to duty, God Where ever flames may rage, Give me the strength to save some life Whatever be its age. Help me embrace a little child Before it is to late Or save an older person from The horror of that fate. Enable me to be alert and hear the weakest shout And quickly and efficiently To put the fire out I want to fill my calling and To give the best in me, To guard my every neighbor and Protect his property. And if according to my fate I am to lose my life Please bless with your protecting hand My children and my wife."
