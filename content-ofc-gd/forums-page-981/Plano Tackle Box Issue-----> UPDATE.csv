Now that's what I call service and backing your product up!!  .....I also have a Plano Guide Series hard box and Soft Side box....needless to say, that I will continue to buy Plano products in the future!  Here's some pics of the damage...    "
234471,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-30 20:16:00,3761,I think every tackle box i have had to date has been Plano. My rod case is also Plano and it is good to know that if something was to go wrong there is good strong customer service to back it up.
234573,ccmtcanada,2008-07-31 00:25:00,7971,"Always great to hear about great customer service!  There are enough bad stories going around, that these posts are refreshing."
234589,BillM,2008-07-31 00:53:00,17367,Any chance you have the model # of that box?  I need something to put my muskie lures in....  keeping them in a big cardboard box is getting a bit old
234611,Rattletrap2,2008-07-31 01:26:00,1652,"Troutandmuskiehunt, That is good customer service and product support. Nice to know some companies still provide this.  As a side note, it does look like the sun has done a number on your box. The blue is all faded out and turned white."
234616,tibbs,2008-07-31 01:45:00,650,It's always great to know what company's stand behind there product!
234740,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-31 11:05:00,1362,"BillM ....it's a great box....it's Model# 7915...Le Baron sells them for $52.94...it can hold up to 40 12"" baits....   Rattletrap2 ...you're observations are good as this box has seen many hours of sunshine...(maybe not this year though as it seems to be cloudy and rainy everyday  ).....I have a feeling that the plastic became brittle from sun damage, but hey, I sent the pics to Plano, and they didn't even question the condition or fading of the box...."
234760,Billy Bob,2008-07-31 11:46:00,5865,"YEP, You can't beat Plano with a Ugly Stick  Don't know if they are still made in Plano, Texas but they guarantee their products for LIFE. They don't advertise that but it's true."
238730,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-11 20:35:00,1362,Here's an update..received the replacement cover last week via courier free of charge!!...NOW THAT'S SERVICE...  Kudo's to Plano Tackle!!!!!  
238910,John Bacon,2008-08-12 02:48:00,3277,  How has the card board box performed in the rain this year?
238914,Leecher,2008-08-12 03:01:00,7832, Great news Steve    Good on Plano's service for sure Jacques
