Has anyone ever owned or have experience with this model. I have googled it and from what I can determine it is more common down south. Actually didn't find anything with Canadian content.  oh yeah and theres LOTS of buttons that I am sure is going to take me many pints to figure out as the manual did not come with it!!!!!!  Any help would be good.  Thanks and tight lines"

This 7520 has capabilities to upgrade and add GPS.  You can also tie other units together and read from the same transducer.  I currently am running the TR-320 with a 7420. Dash and rear deck respectfully. I have added the Mapserver for the GPS and it is a great setup. Google the Mapsever for more info on that. I am currently looking to add one more for the bow. either a 7420, 7520 or another TR-320 Let me know how you like it. Brian"

They carried models which would track a specified distance from shore, or a specified depth.  This required a transducer in the motor, so they starting offering fish finders that worked with their motors.  I beleive that they were bought out by Brunswick who make Mercury, Moterguide, and quite a few different boat lines."
