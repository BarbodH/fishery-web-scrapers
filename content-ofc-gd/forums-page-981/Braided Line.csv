231884,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-23 23:32:00,4399,"After using mono all my life I have finally decided to give braided line a go, I am going to spool one baitcaster with Power Pro and one spinning outfit with Stren Super Braid The guys at Lebaron say I will love it and never go back to mono... we`ll see."
231887,cpguy29,2008-07-23 23:36:00,148,"It has its advantages. More sensitive, less birdnesting, good hooksets. But I always wonder if the fish can see it underwater. Im now experimenting with a small mono leader at the end of my line."
231895,Smokey,2008-07-23 23:52:00,1278,I switched about 10 yrs ago and haven't looked back since.
231940,GoneFishin,2008-07-24 00:56:00,349,I just put braid on my baitcast reel and it is ALOT more sensitive then mono. I was scepitcle about using braid but I think I'm hooked now. Ive been using mono leaders aswell. Braids just to hard to break or even cut lol.
231954,steve_e,2008-07-24 01:27:00,1,"  I like to use a black sharpie and color the last 5 feet of line, seems to work and the black lasts as long  as the 5 feet of line does!!   steve!"
231959,BabyHerc,2008-07-24 01:29:00,285, Why black?  It's just as visible as the green.  And it doesn't blend into weeds.
231990,Rich,2008-07-24 02:06:00,3927,"I don't know about ""not going back""... I have braid on some rods, mono on others. There are times for both.  I strongly believe that the visibility of braid makes a huge difference in clear, calm water. I won't even touch my braided rods in those conditions unless I'm tossing surface baits."
238685,lookinforwalleye,2008-08-11 17:31:00,4399,"Well after a couple of weeks of using braid I don`t see what the big deal is, I found it to be a little more sensitive and yes it`s strong I managed to hook a submerged log that weighed at least 50-60 pounds and I just pulled it to the boat.LOL The thing that bothered me the most about it was I had a hard time seeing it and I am a line watcher so thats a problem.  I could see it being useful for Musky but I can`t see using it extensively."
238693,ricoboxing,2008-08-11 17:37:00,398,"but the disadvantage is the cost!! $15 for 150 yards of pp @ walmart!  and when you set the hook, the fish goes flying outta the water too! lol"
238750,mikeh,2008-08-11 21:50:00,824,I am a big fan of pp. Its great for flipping in pads as well as musky fishing. When the colour starts to fade you can use a marker to colour the last 6 feet of line or so.  pp is more expensive than mono but you can get more years out of the pp before you have to change it.
238835,Leecher,2008-08-12 00:40:00,7832,I just switched to PP braid this year on my spinning reels and love it..... I find it more sensative and get a good hook set when get a strike.....I don't think I'll go back to mono after this experience  Leechman
238900,mepps,2008-08-12 02:23:00,1301,"I recently tried going back to mono on a couple of my spinning reels, next season I'll be goign back to braid - unless this biodegradable stuff is any good...  "
238904,Leecher,2008-08-12 02:30:00,7832,"Lets just say that since I switched to PP, I did not have to respool my reels....with mono....had to re-spool every 2 - 3 weeks depending on the amount of time I was fishing.  Leechman"
