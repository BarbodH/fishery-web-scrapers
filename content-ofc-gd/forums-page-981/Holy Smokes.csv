238791,Rizzo,2008-08-11 23:35:00,4754,"What am I gonna do? Just sold my boat tonight and I have a big gaping hole in my garage. I've had a boat for over 20 years now, and usually bought the new one before parting ways with the old one. Might have to hook up with some OFC'ers to get me out! At least now i can really start the search for the next one...exciting times. Looking for something in the 16 foot range, 40-60 hp 4 stroke and newer than 2000. Kijiji has been a regular site for me since I decided to sell a few weeks ago. First guy who came to look at it snapped it up."

238899,BillM,2008-08-12 02:19:00,17367,Save yourself some $$$ and look at picking up a boat in the US.  Can get quite a boat for your buck down there.
