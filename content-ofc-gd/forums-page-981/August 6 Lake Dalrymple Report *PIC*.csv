Our first stop was at G-Pool, but we had to weigh in at noon due to prior engagements and only had 7 pounds, I missed the second tourney as I was in New York for our 6 man team tournament.  This was my first full tourney this year.  We started the day off with a bang as I hit a 5.12 pounder on a lizard.  I then proceeded to hit a 3 pounder on a frog up shallower and Cal landed a few keepers on a senko.  We moved out to deeper water and started carolina rigging lizards and 7"" worms where Cal hit a 4.84 pounder on his C-Rig worm.  We landed a bunch more 3 pounders on the C-Rigs and flipping jigs in 9-14 fow.  The bite died around 10am and we caught only a few small guys after that.  We weighed in at 18.56 pounds to win the tourney and set a new record for the associate series.  We had big fish util the last team weighed in with a 5.48 pound PIG!!  Fun day had by all.

The Carolina Rig, we run 14lbs XPS fluorocarbon line on a Johnny Morris Elite Baitcast Reel and a 6' MH Johnny Morris Casting Rod.  We had a 3/8oz Bullet sinker, 1 red bead and a swivel with a 24inch leader (still 14 pound fluoro), a 3/0 Owner wide gap hook.  Cal was using a 7 inch red shad Berkley Power worm, I was using a 7 inch Black/blue Yum Zellamander."

I had taken the lake out of my Sibbald camping run, but Misfish told me the lake has some decent bass and it seems he wasn't kidding! I never fished the south end of Dalrymple though. Congrats on the win and thanks for sharing."

237854,smbhunter,2008-08-08 21:31:00,186,Good job Steve. Those fish are hawgs. See you on balsam.
237940,bpsbassman,2008-08-09 01:50:00,941,"That was an impressive performance Steve!!  :worthy: But if you caught all those 3 lbers, how come you only weighed in 4 fish instead of 5??  No more room in the livewell?? I was certainly humbled by all the big fish brought in.  Eva's LM almost weighed as much as my five!! Can't wait for Balsam."

238728,Spiel,2008-08-11 20:24:00,9065,"....Good job Steve, congrats to you both. Dalrymple is one of me favourite little lakes, always been good to me for bass and eyes. I hope I can fit a few days in up there before the summer's over."
