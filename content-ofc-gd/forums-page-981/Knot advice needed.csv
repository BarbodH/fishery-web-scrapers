238599,spooner_jr,2008-08-11 13:21:00,193,"You should be able to use a Palomar; just run the end of the line through the eye, then run it back through leaving a loop on the other side."
238608,PatrickGG,2008-08-11 13:31:00,562,Like spooner said use a Palomar knot and the excess line is used for tying on your drop shot weight.   
238609,Mark Kulik,2008-08-11 13:31:00,348,"Thats also what i do tie the palomar then pass, the tag end down thru the eye-these hooks do have an amazing hook-up %-this is the hook I use when moneys on the line! I use the 2/0 , one thing about them especially the 1/0 is that they bend-you don't want to horse fish in with them."
238614,ecmilley,2008-08-11 13:58:00,2163,"thanks guys I'll retie the set up tonight, i have been tying clinch knots for 25 years trying to remember to tie the palomer is worse than actually tieing it. This was my first time trying to use drop shots system fishing, it pained me to leave my regular jig, crankbait and worm harness on the shore, but the advantages were immediatly apparent with the cold front coming in. 2 small eyes in the 14 inch range dozen smallies nothing huge 2 lb max some duker bluegills. set up was a 7'3"" drop shot carrot stix with a stella reel and 10 lb seagar"
238617,Mark Kulik,2008-08-11 14:07:00,348,"Well EC I can tell you from personal experience that this rig works-not just for smallies, walleye and largemouth also like em, its not always the best deal-but when it is , its really tough to beat!"
238974,ecmilley,2008-08-12 13:11:00,2163,got the problem all figured out now- thanks again be going out after work with some gulp and bass magnent baits and see how my luck is
