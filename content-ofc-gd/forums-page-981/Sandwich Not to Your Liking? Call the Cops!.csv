Reginald Peterson called the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office in hopes that police could have his sandwich made to his satisfaction.  A short time later, Peterson contacted JSO again to complain that police still had not shown up.  When police did arrive Peterson told the officer he had ordered two sandwiches, checked out, and then walked outside to find the subs did not have ""everything"" he ordered.  He told police he became ""very upset"" and ""belligerent"" because the employee making the sandwich was not doing it correctly.  Witnesses inside the store say Peterson eventually started screaming at everyone inside. When Peterson went outside to call police. Employees closed the store and locked the door to keep him from returning.  According to the report, the officer tried to calm Petterson and explain to him the proper way to use 911, but he would not cooperate.  Peterson was arrested and at his request the sandwiches were thrown away."
