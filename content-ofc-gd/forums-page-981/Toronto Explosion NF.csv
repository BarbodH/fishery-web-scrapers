238276,douG,2008-08-10 13:47:00,2693,A series of explosions at a Toronto propane facility sent balls of fire and plumes of black smoke into the early morning sky Sunday and forced police to order the evacuation of a large number of frightened residents.  Witnesses who live near the Sunrise Propane facility in the northwest Toronto neighbourhood of Keele and Wilson said they were awakened by a thunderous explosion and saw the sky light up bright orange before it turned black with smoke.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV5udSWJcZo  http://canadianpress.google.com/article/AL...MhTAetoUpz7_yWQ
