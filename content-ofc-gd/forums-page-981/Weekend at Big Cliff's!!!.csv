He told us all that later in the summer, he'd have everyone who helped back over for some fun as a thank you for helping.  Well, this past weekend was that time.  We (Bly, my youngest and I) headed up on Friday afternoon, and stayed the whole weekend.  The others would arrive on Saturday.  Anyhow, we arrived there around 530pm, and sat and chatted with Big Cliff's wife, Sue until he came home.  As soon as he arrived, my little one jumped up and was all excited!  Big Cliff bbq'd some chicken for us for dinner....just as it was about done, the rain poured down!  My little one was a little disappointed because she wanted to head to the docks to fish.  After dinner, the rain had stopped, so we got a little dock time in.   I managed my only walleye of the weekend....a cute little guy...   We headed in, chatted for a while, had some ice cream and then headed off to sleep...it was an exhausting day!  Saturday morning, Bly took the boat out to do some fishing while I stayed back and occupied our little one.  Beans showed up with his carp gear and went down to the dock.  Well, as soon as Sydney saw this, she suddenly wanted to fish too and proceeded to catch lots of panfish.  Bly came back in from her outing mid morning...the bite was tough, but she did manage a few fish, including this bass.   After coming in, we were treated to an amazing brunch....pancakes, sausages, bacon and eggs....mmmmmm.....they really hit the spot!  The weather was touch and go all day long, and when it looked like we had a few hours before the rains started again, Bly, Sydney and I headed out on the lake.  My little one outfished us yet again, jigging for fish....   The rains came about an hour earlier than expected so we headed off to the local marina, where we had our boat slipped in a covered area, and there was a ton of large panfish in there.  Since the rain was coming down hard, we decided to let our little fish some more....she proceeded to get about a dozen of these guys.   We headed in, and saw that Jeff (Jeffbornfishin), Don (Tracker), Nanook (Jack) and his wife, and Beans' better half had all shown up while we were out!  It was great to sit and chat with everyone again to catch up on our lives since we last met.  I hope the Tangled Lines is feeling better Jeff...we missed her there.  Here's a group shot of most of us from that day.....   After everyone left, we watched some Olympic events and then headed off to bed.  Sunday morning was weather perfect!  Big Cliff and I decided to head out on the water.  We had a feeling the fishing would be tough....the unstable weather and big cold front that came through overnight didn't point towards a good day on the water.  At 6am though...the lake looked inviting!   As expected, the fishing was VERRRRRY slow, so we packed it in and came back to the dock to see my little one fishing yet again....LOL.  She cant get enough of it.   Here she is with her new fishing partner....Andy!   Big Cliff and Sydney decided to feed some ducks before we...you guessed it....went out in Big Cliff's boat to see about catching a fish or two.   Once again, the fishing was tough, but Sydney did manage to catch an OFAH worthy Sunfish...measuring in at 9"".   Here's a nice shot of Big Cliff and Sydney discussing fishing strategies.   At one point, her little jr. rod bent right over....she said that she had weeds, so she pulled and suddenly there was nothing.  She reeled in her line and it was sliced right off!! Wonder if it was a muskie or walleye?  I guess we'll never know.  We headed back in and it was time for us to leave.  As you can tell here, my little one was a little sad to have to say goodbye and she wouldn't let Big Cliff go!   Thank you so much Big Cliff and Sue.  We had a wonderful weekend...the fishing was tough but it's always great to spend time with you guys.  We'll do it again soon!!"
