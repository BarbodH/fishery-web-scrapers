Every try searching for something on Kijiji and you have to keep switching locations? Can't find it in the city you are looking and want to look elsewhere.  Well thanks to Google, you can search ALL areas of Kijiji.ca or .com by typing this into Googles search bar.  site:website.com/.ca ""search term""  ie. if you want to search for Shimano for ALL locations on Kijiji without switching cities, type:  site:kijiji.ca ""shimano""  click search and there you go. (you must type the word ""SITE:""  You can use it on other sites too such as ebay and wherever else has location based services. This is not anything new but I have never seen anyone post it.  There are a ton of ways for searching google a lot more efficiently, this is just one really basic one I use all the time.  So hopefully it helps you guys out."

238268,Rizzo,2008-08-10 13:32:00,4754,"my worry about that route is you find what you want...but its 8000 km's away! I guess that's ok for small stuff, but I'm in the market for a boat that I can look at first before buying. For me, I just do the old ""change city"", and it quickly grabs what you're looking for, don't even have to enter your price range etc again."
