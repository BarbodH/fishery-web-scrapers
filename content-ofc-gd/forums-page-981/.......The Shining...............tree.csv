238805,mistyriver1,2008-08-12 00:06:00,600,Great report Terry.  Nice looking pike !!!
238192,Terry,2008-08-10 01:29:00,14456,"well another year and another vacation at shiningtree I wasn't as excited as most years because I don't have an ATV anymore so it cuts back on the number of back lakes I could visit, I was going to go to one of my best lakes because the logging company was making a road close to the lake so I figured I could drive most of the way and walk in the rest well as it turned out the logging company make the road too close to some lakes, so the MNR has banned all travel along the road and it's a $5000.00 fine so they tell me if you get caught..so much for that.  go to the cabin around 3 and on the water by 330 started catching walleye, looked like it was going to be a great week after dinner we went  out again and couldn't buy a fish next day same thing, everyone in camp had the same complaint..no fish that night about 930 and only one walleye for the day. we started to troll back towards the camp...my buddy got a fish..we figured it was a good size pike , it stayed down and made a few good runs but as it broke the surface I saw it was a big walleye..big for that lake anyways..not Bay of Quinte big, but still big and his personal best it was bigger then the one the lodge had on the wall, that they said was 8lbs it was bigger then the picture on the counter of the one they said was weighed  and was 9.9, but who knows no one could believe he let it go but were impressed by the picture... I didn't ask if I could show his picture <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=happy1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/happy1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  well that was exciting but short lived as the fishing didn't pick up till late WEd. night, so there were a few days of me cursing the fishing world and asking the fishing gods what I did to offend them. the fishing did pick up and we did well after all saw Cory and Heather putting a boat in at the public ramp on  the lake, they were staying at another camp that allows dogs.  all in all it was a good week and I always love going there.  first fish of the trip <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3290.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3290.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3310.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3310.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3312.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3312.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   never hurts to throw in a sunset <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF19331.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF19331.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF2411.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF2411.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF1929.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF1929.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=terry-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/terry-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
238199,Rizzo,2008-08-10 01:47:00,4754,"nice looking fish! Good on you for putting the big 'eye back (although I would hope most people would, I'm kind of surprised that people would expect you to keep a fish like that). Either way, nice looking fish and good to hear the big one is still out there making babies."
