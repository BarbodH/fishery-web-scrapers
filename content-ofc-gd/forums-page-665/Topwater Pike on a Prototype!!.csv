WE didnt have much time today, so we went up to lake Tomiko this afternoon to have a quick looksee. I havent fished there in a while so we started poking around for topwater bass and Bammo.. if we didnt nail this.. right out of the water as soon as it hit. That was fun!!    Dunno where were gonna go tomorrow. WE were gonna head to camp for a week, but Mioniques not feeling well, and it sposed to rain alot, so were gonna put it off a few days.. but that don't mean I can sneak around here!!"
