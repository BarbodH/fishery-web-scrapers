479798,Rich Clemens,2010-06-27 00:15:00,3131,"Just pulled in around 4:30pm today. Total catch - 9 Pike for me and 1 for Patsy. Not very good odds, figuring we were up there for 9 days."
479870,Joey,2010-06-27 03:55:00,9122,"We pulled in around 4:30 aswell Rich.  It was a hard go out there with that stained water and the low levels.  You'll get the big gal next time, you've put in your time now, its your turn I know it.  Joey"
477576,bigfish1965,2010-06-20 22:09:00,3382,"Let us all know you are safely home. Good trip, bad fishing, nice weather, viscous mosquitoes.  Ohh..and that which has been seen...cannot be unseen!"

477602,TJQ,2010-06-21 00:04:00,7806,Were alive....
477610,Radnine,2010-06-21 00:20:00,1538," Now there is something you don't see every day, an OFC'er admitting that the fishing was bad. It must have been extremely bad. Jim"
477614,Jewelbee,2010-06-21 00:29:00,422,"Those of you that missed it......so sorry for you. Try for next year. These people are amazing. I had a great time and everyone made me feel so welcome!!! Thanks guys, already can't wait for next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Many thanks again Roy for giving us the use of your boat....It was a pleasure fishing with you!!!"
477616,irishfield,2010-06-21 00:33:00,26272,Wish we could have met you Julie... and the rest of the clan! Wasn't in the cards for the first time in 6 years! I can see TJ any day of the week by just dropping in on the Montreal..... the rest of the gang I'm kickin myself that we didn't get there. Joe and Art... what can I say.... at least I didn't have to deal with them trying to steal my wife... lol...
477640,John,2010-06-21 02:02:00,2956,"We're home, great time as usual. Great to meet you Julie. Will leave the comments to a minimum as we all know what goes on at Lakair.........well you all know the rest. Will post some censored pics tomorrow."
477643,BillM,2010-06-21 02:17:00,17367,So where are all the fish?  (I assume still swimming in the lake?  )
477645,Jewelbee,2010-06-21 02:34:00,422,Yup....Pretty much...LOL
477647,BillM,2010-06-21 02:39:00,17367,"  LOL!!!  Ah well, I've been on a few fishing trips that I didn't do much fishing on either   Glad you folks had a good time."
477652,Rattletrap2,2010-06-21 02:58:00,1652,So.........no fish were hurt in the making of this trip? LOL
477667,SlowPoke,2010-06-21 05:22:00,2984,"The best Lakair trip yet! It was short but sweet. For those that haven't been, it's not really about the fishing. It's not really about the weather. It's about putting faces to names and catching up with those you don't get to see often. Special thanks to Art and Joe for extending an invitation to their cabin to douG and I. They even went to the trouble of adorning our room with a Canadian flag!!! Two of the finest people you'll ever meet. Some new faces this year and I'm already looking forward to seeing them at Quinte or next year back at Lakair. Thanks again to those that supplied prizes, food and great mammaries!  And now for exclusive Lakair photos...      ... okay perhaps they're not that exclusive. Anyone that has been to Lakair probably has a few of these photos over the years."
477672,TJQ,2010-06-21 11:14:00,7806,LOL.. those have been retouched!!!
477678,corvette1,2010-06-21 12:09:00,1765,made it home at 8.30 i was making great time until i hit the 400 what a joke a parking lot
477708,bigfish1965,2010-06-21 14:06:00,3382, Wow..the second one is a rare pic...no bottle in your hand...maybe it is retouched...lol.
477709,Harrison,2010-06-21 14:08:00,2202, I wonder what the bottle replaced then?
477798,Gerritt,2010-06-21 18:05:00,6129,"Just walked in the door, It was nice to see old friends again, and meet some new ones!  Good times were had by all!  TJ you should of seen Jackie's Bed Head this morning!!  G."
