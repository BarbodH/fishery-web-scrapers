480142,Fang,2010-06-28 00:47:00,1330,"Landed back in the city Friday night and just getting some time to put up a report. Six of us stayed at WIshing U Were Fishin's Diamond Lake outpost cabin for a week. As a paying guest it's nice to sit back and just fish for a week and have some fun with they guys. We flew out of Temagami and within 15 minutes touched down on Diamond Lake. It's been 4 years since I was in here fishin and boy was it good to be back. Saturday threw us a mixed bag of weather with a wild lightening storm forcing Rob(Family Guy)and I to take cover on shore. After a 15 minute downpour we mad it back too camp a little wet and got ready for day 2.  The week was full of walleye and a few trout. Bit was slow and we had to work for fish with slip bobber and worm rigs, jig and worm and trolling bottom bouncers. The trout were active and we got 9 small ones trolling frozen anchovy in meat rigs. 117 walleye, 9 Lake trout and some pike for 6 guys. Almost all our walleye were on the top end of the slot limit. It was hard top get a 16"" under to keep. Had another good meal of walleye and a couple of the guys took home a few fish. The last time I was there the avg size was 23"" so they are getting bigger.  Dean got the longest walleye at 29"" and to get 2 fish over 28"" in this lake (known for numbers not big ones)is a good sign that the size limits are starting to produce bigger fish.  Enjoy the pics, Rob's nice trout   Distracting scenery   A typical trout   My Big Walleye 28.75""   close up on a clone 23-25"" fish   2 Trout came for dinner   The meals were A-1, here we polish off the lakers and 2 lbs of shrimp - nap time right after   The empty drum, I drink Macklays   A couple walleye we caught had vivid blue fins on dorsal and tail. here you can get a glimpse but the shot just doesn't show the blue as good as in person.   Probably back up on Temagami the end of the month for smallmouth."
