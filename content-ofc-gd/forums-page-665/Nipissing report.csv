478424,Daplumma,2010-06-23 02:00:00,1961,"Water was down,weed beds were hard to find.Art and I managed a few the first night out.Got some OOS bass and some snot rockets Friday.Saturday was not so good.Sunday one tiny one.Nothing worth taking pics of.Well maybe a few of the fine folks that made their way up there.If anyone wants full size copies of any of the pics PM me. Joe                        Sorry about the no fish pics.Left out a bunch of incriminating ones also."
478425,Jewelbee,2010-06-23 02:04:00,422,Nice pictures guys! So nice to meet you. See ya next year eh? LOL!
478427,irishfield,2010-06-23 02:06:00,26272,"Thanks Joe! Make me miss it more....  Shame to see the dock shot getting smaller instead of bigger.. and I could have done without ""harry bum crack"".. affectionately known as TJ !  Glad you all had a good time!! Tell that Art fella.. my brother from another mommma... diet pepsi !  Kevin even put in the perfect dock for me to pull up beside! Too bad we couldn't get there...  "
478433,pikeguy,2010-06-23 02:17:00,195,some great pics you got there.   That was a great weekend lots of fun made some new friends from way down south and in ontario great bunch.   We may have been tied on saturday but i went home with mine  so i guess i won that   (oops that was for Art)   And Shorty said thanks for the beans they were great
478441,corvette1,2010-06-23 02:43:00,1765,awesome pictures it was nice to every one from the board i had a great time
478449,Gerritt,2010-06-23 02:59:00,6129,"Joe, some real good shots there! Sad to see you guys leave early though  Glad to hear you made it home safe and in one piece, hopefully we will see you and Art next year.  G"
478485,lew,2010-06-23 10:05:00,12766,"Thanks Joe, lotsa good pictures there. I really missed being there this year but like I said earlier, I'll be heading up there in 11 days so that sorta takes the sting out. Looks like Kevin has done a good job of extending the docks to deeper water.  Seems like a much smaller group this year.  Hard to believe how low that water is compared to other years and I'll bet you and Art were the only 2 that felt safe running around there with the jetboat, eh ?? That rig of yours would shine in that skinny water.  Did you get up into the Muskrats or West Bay area at all ??.... just wondering if the weeds are sparce up there as well."
478487,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-23 10:19:00,1183,Nice pictures..... Where was GCD? Are Joey and Roy fighting?  Is that Art posing like a poser in that chair? Anything DIET is not good for - stick with the the real thing or not at all.  Thanks for posting.
478495,Daplumma,2010-06-23 11:05:00,1961,"  We brought a Ranger bass boat this year and spent a couple of days avoiding rocks just like everyone else.Some weeds in Jennings,some in both Muskrats.When I say some I mean a very few.They may be up by the time you get there.Bring a spare prop,lots of new freinds there now.We had to learn how to get to our old spots with a prop boat,only banged it up twice and that was at low speed "
478496,lew,2010-06-23 11:14:00,12766,"Never thought of you as a bass boat kinda guy Joe, always picture you in the camo Jon  That spare prop is already on the shopping list."
478502,John,2010-06-23 11:45:00,2956, Ya mean this is not full size already!
478504,Spiel,2010-06-23 11:50:00,9065,It was a great weekend right up till the attempted dog napping.....
478507,lew,2010-06-23 11:54:00,12766, I was wondering why your pooch was in Art's truck
478513,motv8tr,2010-06-23 12:05:00,2587,"Great pics Joe, it was good to see you, maybe next year we'll get a chance to go fishing....  Maureen"
478590,ccmtcanada,2010-06-23 16:25:00,7971,Thanks for the pictures!  Sure missed being up there this year...looks like a great time was had by all as usual!  Glad to see the southern contingent made it there and safely back home.  The one good thing about this is that no one can blame me for the lack of fish caught!! LOL.
478606,aplumma,2010-06-23 17:17:00,6896,  Nope real Pepsi all the way I look fat on the camera all slouched over... I am not posing we don't sit in campin chairs here much boy are they uncomfortable.I was much more comfortable in the bass boat. Thanks again to all for the wonderful time and if you can make it to the Lak Air G2G next year it is well worth it.   Art
478609,Terry,2010-06-23 17:23:00,14456,"good report, right up to the butt photo  didn't need to see that..LOL"
478611,Spiel,2010-06-23 17:26:00,9065," No one needs to see that Terry, nor should they be exposed to it without warning.....LOL  ""Just saying"".......   "
478831,Jewelbee,2010-06-24 00:54:00,422,"No worries Spiel,,,,she would come home, just like Lassie"
479539,Spiel,2010-06-25 22:03:00,9065," I believe you're right JB, but it would be a harrowing trip for her.   "
479572,aplumma,2010-06-26 01:23:00,6896,who are you kidding if we kidnapped Brook you would come to get her and never leave  Faux Farm. It's like Disney land on crack down here.   Art
479583,kickingfrog,2010-06-26 02:07:00,8333, Disney land or never land???    Sorry I missed this year.
