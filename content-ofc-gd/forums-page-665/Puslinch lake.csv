478966,Jaymerica,2010-06-24 12:27:00,12,"The GRCA own a large portion of land on the South West end of the lake. There is a over grown road  but it is gated off with no trespassing signs or no parking, I can't remember which. I am sure the only reason the GRCA haven't opened it to the public is because of $ and demand. I don't believe it would be ideal beach/swimming location. I am more then willing to raise money if they would consider opening this to the public. I am a concert promoter and would be willing to organize a series of local concerts (NOT LIKE LAKE ALIVE) to raise funds to have this location opened to the public.

If they were to set up a parking lot and an out house such as mountsberg C A and Burns C A,that would suffice with a little ramp as well.Thats all that is needed.Camping is available at shade mill ca,if Im correct. Thanks everyone,I know its gonna be a long trek.So any support would be awesome,from who ever. Everyone Ive spoken to has had the same issues as well. I am still waiting for a respone from a few higher ups. When I do depending on the response,I will give a co worker a heads up.He is a ski instructor for the place in question(no names being mentioned on my part for now).

479231,danbouck,2010-06-24 23:56:00,4380,There is no camping at Shades Mill.  The GRCA owns a lot of property that they do not plan on doing anything with. They buy the land for the sole purpose of conservation. I asked them when they bought a chunk of my Grandfathers land.

The lake is probably close to 75% private shoreline. its not a big lake. But its basically owned. Not by the ski school or any one person. Opening a CA / public access at puslinch would be great but there will always be power boating. If you're looking for a quiet wave free day of fishing, shades mill and the grand river are both very close. There's lots of good fishing available in the kw region. Spread your wings. Fish puslinch in the morning and another spot in the aft."
478068,Shaner,2010-06-22 06:36:00,7,Just a thought but a well written letter to a local paper such as The Cambridge Times or Kitchener Record might be in order. It may get through to these idiots when their actions are publicly called into question. There was a drowning on the lake fairly recently that gained some attention and a well worded letter could be perfect for getting the point about boater safety out there.....
478069,Shaner,2010-06-22 06:37:00,7,oh and I also agree with the video idea....
478087,jediangler,2010-06-22 11:43:00,1923,"Puslinch lake is the largest ""Kettle lake"" in North America. Maybe we should start an organization to protect it by banning all gas motors. Then the water skiers will have to go somewhere else. It's even worse in the winter with guys racing snowmobiles up and down the lake. Seriously the problem is MONEY. Those that live on the lake and the family that has run the waterskiing on the lake for 3 generations have it, and those of us who cartop canoes and kayaks there to fish, don't. If you called the cops they would probably ticket you for something instead of the guy being an idiot."
478118,Jaymerica,2010-06-22 13:46:00,12,Below is a facebook group I started to try and get the Grand River Conservation Authority to consider opening the lake access they own to the public. Why do we keep getting asked for donations to a lake that we aren't welcome on? This is why I stopped fishing the lake. If the GRCA would consider a public access I would consider donating money. In fact I would even organize a fund-raiser myself. http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=107233949325170#!/group.php?gid=107233949325170&v=wall

478392,sauce,2010-06-23 00:26:00,219,"Puslinch, just grin and bear it. Only thing you have on the water skiers is that some of them don't use spotters. There's somethin to watch for. Tellin the cops that they're makin waves isn't gonna get much attention. It drives me nuts sometimes but its worth it."
478403,Syn,2010-06-23 00:47:00,519,"Pull out the camera and film what they are doing. Write a letter to the instructor body who governs water ski instructors (if there is one), marina operator, and report to police. Post video on youtube.

As for the fund raiser,I beleive its to fund their own pockets!Concert,big shin ding!Ive only seen a dredger/silt cleaner for two seasons!Then disappeared! I like going there to fish then go for a bite to eat!Then some fishing behind the restaurant,before the old one burnt down.The niciest hosts youll ever meet.Ive even fished ad was called when my diner was ready! Hows that for service!But next door!!!!!!!The oposite! Mods can you keep this open,please!I want to talk to the grca and the mnr.If this lake is a kettle lk i would like to see some protection.No different than rockwood ca,and kettle lakes pp outside of timmins.Many others as well.

Keep ontario beautiful Lets protect what we have!

If they insist that you pay make sure that you insist that you pay in the office and watch the money go into the till. Ask for a reciept to put on your dash too. Make it an inconvenience to them."
478856,Dave Bailey,2010-06-24 02:07:00,1641,"Keep in mind that if you run a tournament you will need a place for a weigh-in station and associated activities. That means that you'll need either permission from the GRCA to run it on their property, or you will need it from a private individual, and it certainly seems that they might not want it. If you get permission from the GRCA then there is a major question - access. If there isn't any way to get into their area other than by boat that makes things difficult. The scales I have are expensive and heavy, and I would hate for something to happen to them while transporting the unit in a canoe. Given the way the other 'boaters' treat canoes the possibility of getting swamped is increased, especially if they know that we want to run a tournament.  But if you can easily access the site then I might seriously consider offering my services, I run the Gals 'n' Pals tournaments so I know what's involved."

But if you use their property and didnt pay!Tresspassing!So Pay first and get a hand written note signed and printed by the attendant!For liability sakes! The money they receive goes where ever!When ice fishing and you uproach the laneway, they are there to collect! No Invoice! Keep in mind,I didnt start this to shut down a family business,Its the safety fact for us joe blows that do enjoy going there! I am waiting for a response from the grca,then I will make a venture out there again to tape it.And see what happens!Remember,Im not the only one with this concern!

Well, A water skiing instructor started his daily lesson with the students.I know from exp that they dont care for other boaters on the lake,esp an outsider.Ive fished this lake for many years,more ice fishing than anything else.  Any way the other boater left and I was out there alone in a canoe.I stayed well clear of their run.But did he,NO!!!!!!!!!he aproached within a hundered feet at full throttle doing figure 8s!!!!!!!!No once but twice.So I ventured closer to shore to give him the rest of the lake.Then again!!!!!!!!After that another local coming back from the shop,decided hes gonna go full throttle within 30 feet of me. Perhaps they want this lake to themselves,no out siders wanted!Lets see what happens next week! Every year the same Bull!Ive seen it happen to others!  So all in all if your in a small boat/canoe in that lake.KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN! Cause there is no call for that at all for what they do!"

477856,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-21 21:22:00,932,"This happens all the time and it can result in dangerous situations.  You're only ever a split second away from being a front-page news story in those situations and I think you should lodge a complaint.  Being in a canoe you're more susceptible to their idiocy and people like that should lose their license.  That behaviour doesn't wash anywhere else in our society - it shouldn't on the water either.  Some recent things that have happened to me (albeit not dangerous).  16 Kayakers coming down the Grand.  One guy is in the group yelling ""go behind the fishermen!""  We move over to protect our hole that is full of rising, active fish.  One guy goes right in front of us, the other 15 go behind us.  As the guy is going in front of us he asks ""Are you guys getting anything?  Does boat traffic effect the fishing?""  4 kayakers decide to go out onto a busy Steelhead river in awful weather and land themselves right in my casting lane to battle the rapids in front of me.  They sit there for 30-45 minutes.  I was definitely considering running a spoon by their boats, but my better judgment won out.  Belwood and Conestoga Lakes (also GRCA) are full of donkeys like the water-skiers that you just mentioned.  I guess the GRCA lakes need some serious unsafe-boater attention.  Go get 'em V."
477861,alexcba,2010-06-21 21:28:00,634,ryan your a better man than i. id do something to scare the crap out of them or get them out of my hole lol. a nice bell or egg sinker right on the side of the hull usually get their attention. if they wanna discuss things on shore they would be more than welcome.

I just stood up, and yelled a few expletives, and waved my arms like a mad man....I pointed to the wide open lake they could be using as opposed to shooting the narrow channel between an island that I happened to be fishing along with another boat.  They got the message apparently as they went out to the lake and stayed there.  Sometimes you just have to let them know your pissed off. Unfortunatly a lot of these people acting like idiots don't actually know they are being disruptive. Alot of these people don't fish, and have no clue that whipping around you is hindering your efforts.  Heck a lot of these people are looking for waves to bounce off, and don't realize the waves they are sending. Its not exuse, but sometimes being a bit more vocal, and visually upset might help?
