MOst of the time we were fishing in the rain!   But to the pike anglers this is the best time.    sly with his PB    snakes wwre hitting hard on the swimbaits.    C& R is the only way to go guys!!    this 10 lbs pike nailed my STORM perch patern on a 10 FOW cobage bay.    Then it was bass openner is QC.    They fight like a TRAIN!    flipping the cray fish from YUM is a must in this lake.    As we are entering pike bay,  sly pulls out this gator out of a deep 15 FOW weed bed.    WELL what do you know........ pike like crayfish also.    As night falls the pike and smallies come back to life....        this pike has a tear in its eye.  the next day.  smallies on the list .    4 ish from sly on a cotton cordell ..... cray fish patern.    flipping the deep rocks and logs produce massive smallies.  LAST but not least.  2 onces form a nickel.    a huge gurl... beat up from the spawn. but swam away strong.   see ya in the fall beauty!"
