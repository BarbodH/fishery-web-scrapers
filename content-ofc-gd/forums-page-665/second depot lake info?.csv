Second Depot Lake  Not a super busy lake although it can be, If you're staying at the campground there are some seasonal campers that you can ask about the fishing.  I've fished it once when I was camping there and seemed to do good with bass to the south and west of the island with campsites 1, 2, 3 on it, didn't have a lot of time to explore the lake though.  Third Depot Lake is a short drive (or paddle) away and might be another option for you although I've never been there  jjcanoe"
479982,shan&jay,2010-06-27 16:30:00,55,thanks for the info. im actually stayin close by on a small river i think but we might stay a few days right on the lake if its decent enough for a campsite. staying on a family members property not the campground
