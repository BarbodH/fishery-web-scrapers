There hasn't been much time for any heavy fishing beyond sitting at Hammy harbour while the bride goes for treatments. Yesterday I finally got to do a little road trip fishing. Kicked the chauffeur outta bed  and off to 3 spots in just over 5 hours, and all were producing. Great way to mark the passing of another decade.    Had to cut the road trip short as the family had something up their sleeve. Caught a good number of bass, WGSF's, even a bowfin. I would have stayed out til dark, but the cold beer was calling."
