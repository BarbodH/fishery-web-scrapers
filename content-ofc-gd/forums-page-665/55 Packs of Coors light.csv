479300,Hooked,2010-06-25 03:32:00,891,"  That's a crazy deal!  Never understood why they stop selling Coors in Ontario beer stores?  From what I remember when they did, it was pretty good. Now if they brought back to Ontario Coors, 55 packs, and Oscar Meyer Hotdogs, things would be so much more live-able in Ontario."
479304,pike n' whities,2010-06-25 03:43:00,131,"  holy man, you need to live on the border!
