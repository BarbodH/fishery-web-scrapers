479594,Handlebarz,2010-06-26 03:00:00,3790,A friend of mine has two Cannon's hand for sale $250 for the pair they have the breakaway (QuickDraw Cabela's)rod holder on each one and both have quick release bases (not swivel) with a lot of wire I don't know how much wire or pound it is but there is enough to call them full of wire.
479642,Spiel,2010-06-26 10:32:00,9065,Perhaps a quick perusal of the classified rules would explain things.....just sayin.  http://www.ofncommun...ction=rules&f=5
479656,fishinfool,2010-06-26 14:11:00,366, Hey Fireman  I have two Big Jon electrics I am looking to sell. They both have swivel bases and I have cannonballs and some flashers etc that I can let go with them. I am looking for $400.00 for the works. Call me if you like. 905 239 8119 Stan
479660,Fish Farmer,2010-06-26 14:29:00,2234, Stan are they long arms or capt. paks. I'd even be interested
479666,fishinfool,2010-06-26 14:58:00,366," Hey fishfarmer  I think they would be the Capt Paks, they are only about 20"" or so long. I can send some pics a little later if you like. I am just heading out to Pigeon to try for some Wallies. I will check back here when I get back hopefully with some pics and dinner.  Stan"

480222,thefireman,2010-06-28 02:23:00,51,Thanks guys I'll be in touch. Still researching which make I want to invest in.  I hear the Cannons are #1 with Scotty coming in 2nd? Lots of crap to read through.  But again thanks
