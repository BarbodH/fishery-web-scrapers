479529,shan&jay,2010-06-25 21:16:00,55,"bought this unit a few months ago just installing it now and noticed it has 3 plugs in the back and the one in the center is supposed to be for temperature but there was no wire in the box for it is this something i have to pay extra for or was my package just missing the wire? it said ""temperature included"" on the box"
479545,limeyangler,2010-06-25 23:00:00,5204,"Hey Shan &jay,  I'm not quite sure about all the wire stuff you mention, but usually the transducer reads temperature , already built in, no need for anything 'extra'."
479546,Roy,2010-06-25 23:12:00,13728,I just read the manual and it seems the cord is needed but is not an option and comes with the unit. You might want to call the people who sold it to you.
479558,CLofchik,2010-06-26 00:11:00,854,"The stock temp is built into the transducer, you don't need the middle temp slot.  You can however purchase a separate temp input sensor and use it with your unit (i.e. you use the transducer in a shoot-tru-hull installation, but still want accurate temp so you install an optional temp sensor on the transom)  Caveat Empor-- It has been known for Ebay'ing Craigslisters to replace a more expensive dual beam transducer w/temp with an El Cheapo generic transducer.  To replace a 'ducer is almost the cost of the entire unit."
479565,shan&jay,2010-06-26 00:48:00,55,"hmm mixed replys, guess il have to see if the transducer reads temp when i put it in the water"
479623,a.cortellessa,2010-06-26 03:55:00,142,the fish finder functions without that cord? Just the temperature doesn't work?  
479883,Woodsman,2010-06-27 04:54:00,1286,I have a 170. CLofchik's answer is the correct one. Transducer reads the temp. Mine worked fine on Lake Erie yesterday with surface temps of 69 degs. F.  Rick
