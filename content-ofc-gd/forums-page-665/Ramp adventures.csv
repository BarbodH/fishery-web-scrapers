Its so shallow that most people avoid it but with my 12 ft that I just push off and winch back up, no prob or so I thought.  I drive a front wheel drive Toyota Matrix - standard transmission and the right wheel is spinning.  So this is what I did:  1. Take the boat off. 2. Disconnect the trailer and tie it to a stump so it does not roll back. 3. With a lighter load I was able to drive out. 4. Back in again on a diff angle. 5. Re-attach the trailer, put the boat on and was able to pull the whole rig out.  Some anxious moments for sure.  I think my next car will be AWD!  KawathaGuy"

479720,Handlebarz,2010-06-26 20:07:00,3790,glad to here you made it out alright.  heck people always looked at us like we were crazy when they would see dad and I pulling the boat down roads not meant for a truck and here would be the good ol caravan tracking on and then hit them crappy launches but if you take them like you did most are do able. I think Buster might have been with us on the groomed trail ride but that's a different story for another thread.
479725,lew,2010-06-26 20:26:00,12766,"Funny, but I'm just the opposite when I'm looking for a boat ramp.  I've got a huge amount of $$$$ invested in my boat & truck, a small fortune in fishing tackle, plus whatever I spend on gas for both the truck & boat, along with whatever other expenses are required for a day of fishing.  After all that, the last thing I'm concerned with is another $15 to launch the boat. A decent marina will normally have a parking lot, a nice level concrete ramp, a good dock to tie the boat to while I move the truck and often gas pumps if required.  I always scratch my head at the many times on this board where folks will plan a day on the water but will ask where they can launch a boat for free.  Maybe it's just me, but the fee for a good ramp is the smallest expense I'll incure all day, but is one of the best investments."
