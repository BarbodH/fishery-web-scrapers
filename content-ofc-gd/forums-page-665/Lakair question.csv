478649,corvette1,2010-06-23 18:00:00,1765,yes they do have a concrete ramp
478654,Gerritt,2010-06-23 18:09:00,6129,they do... but the water level is below it. My problems came when I got my 2 front wheels off the concrete.. (my fault) and had to try to pop the truck up over the ledge of the pads... anyways I had to be towed out... if you have 4 wheel drive you will be ok. Thanks again Tybo!
478663,bassman,2010-06-23 18:18:00,384,"Thanks, I've got a mini van without 4x4. I'll check with the lodge or you guys before I go up."
478684,SlowPoke,2010-06-23 18:35:00,2984," This might be one of the times a front wheel drive might help at a ramp! The water is low but your front drive wheels should still be on the concrete. In any event, I'm sure Kevin's big Dodge won't be too far away to lend a hand."
478691,Gerritt,2010-06-23 18:45:00,6129,"agreed Brian, just make sure you're drive wheels are on the concrete pads and you should be fine! As I found out the hard way LOL"
478701,SlowPoke,2010-06-23 18:51:00,2984," Were you trying to qualify for the next ""Boat launch bozo"" thread?"
478712,Gerritt,2010-06-23 19:02:00,6129,"I was not qualifying, I was winning the race!"
479337,irishfield,2010-06-25 05:34:00,26272,Stay in line with the patio stones.. DO NOT tuck in beside the dock. that cost me a $100 lamp last year... there is a boulder in the water there that you can't see! Mark the thang Kevin...
479353,danbouck,2010-06-25 10:35:00,4380, It is out of the water this year
479793,Rich Clemens,2010-06-27 00:04:00,3131,"Yeah - you can see the rock out of the water now.  There are two rows of concrete slabs, but ya got a few feet of sand before hitting the water.    Check out my other post, where I described some of the water hazards that I had found - mostly out in South Muskrat and on the way out there.  Even from the launch, it is a gradual incline going out into the water.  I had to float mine off this year."
