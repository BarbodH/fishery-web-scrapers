478538,NAW,2010-06-23 14:01:00,4022,"Dave could have just tossed this Motor/Tank on his curb and let the first Joe Blow driving by take it.  But instead he posted it on the OFC as FREE.  Man I love this Forum.  Not only do I learn something new every day, but I also have a chance to get free stuff  Thank you so much Dave  Check out the pic.  Sweat eh!! Definitly worth the 3 hour round trip to the city. "

478716,NAW,2010-06-23 19:11:00,4022," It needs a $200 pinion gear.  And I had one on an old evenrude that I sold for $150  two months ago!!  After it's running, it'l be worth atleast $900 eh?  Someone was trying to sell the exact same motor on Kijiji for $1250 last month, that seems a little high."
