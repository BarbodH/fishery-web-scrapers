478932,Billy Bob,2010-06-24 11:18:00,5865,If for nothing else you Canadians can be proud to say we have the best concentration of mosquitoes in the world...them little buggers especially love me and my O-negative blood.  All my proven combative ways to fend off mosquitoes have been defeated by the Canadian Air Force. They can NOT be defeated.

480251,irishfield,2010-06-28 02:48:00,26272,All this rain the last week.. the blood sucking vampires are out in full force and the deer flies are bad as well.
480254,Roy,2010-06-28 02:56:00,13728,Lots of BIG skeeters here today. They could stand flatfooted and rape a turkey.
480255,irishfield,2010-06-28 02:58:00,26272,Dang... wait 'till the spiel mod gets that one! lol
480291,Rich Clemens,2010-06-28 10:27:00,3131,"  That's what we found at Lakair.  Land or water, the deer flies found us during the day.  Sitting with John and Barb at their cottage in the evening, putting your ear to the screen, sounded like you were next to a bee hive.  Oh well - that's the north country.  I guess they have to eat too."
