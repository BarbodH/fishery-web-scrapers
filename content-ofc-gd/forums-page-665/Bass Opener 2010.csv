479962,danbouck,2010-06-27 15:20:00,4380,"Well I left work early on Friday at 3:00, picked up my buddy James and went home to load up the boat. Got everything together and said bye to Sam and the kids.  We got to paris and it was a duplicate of the drive to Lakair lol it was only a few hunded feet.    This year we took James' new puppy Flint. It's a cross between a German Short Haired Pointer and a vizsla (it's not a lab lol)    After stopping at Sobeys for some water and lunch we arrived in Long Point and had the boat loaded at the dock by 6:15. I dropped the trailer off at the cottage and headed over to Port Rowan to spend the night on the boat. Shawn (SRT) met us there about 15 or 20 minutes after we arrived.  We spent the night chatting about everything and anything over a few beers. Just after 9 Ryan (The Urban Fisherman) called me up to tell me his list of chores he had to do before heading out (Sorry bud lol) and that he wasn't making it out until the morning. For some reason no pictures were taken Friday night  We headed to bed around midnight. The mosquitoes were eating me alive and I couldn't sleep so I pulled an all-nighter fishing the peir and put about 10k on the leg odometer. Shawn was sleeping great according to his snoring  This is the first pic from opener    It wasn't that hard to stay up until we had to go, At 3am Ryan sends me a text saying good morning. He then said the magical word ""COFFEE"" but unfortunately it was closed. So I drank a red bull and hoped that would do it.  At 4am after we saw the biggest Dave Mercer fan ever driving past  (This guy wrapped his Jon Boat like Daves   lol) We then pulled out of Port Rowan . This was my first experience driving my boat at night, I know the lake very well but the boat traffic was already crazy! Lights everywhere and closer than you thought.  We were on the lake to watch a great sunrise    We found a spot away from other boats and started drifting minnows. By 5:30 I had caught 2 smallies and lost 3. I headed over to my favourite spot and caught a quick smallie, largie, a pike, rock bass and bluegill.    I tied on some flouro and threw on a powerbait heavyweight worm and tossed it in the weedbed, moments later my rod doubled over and I felt some big head shakes. Before I could get excited it bit me off. It was either a musky or a BIG pike   For the next couple hours it was slow. I wanted to hit the north channel but I didn't want to deal with the boats, we can catch a ton of average smallies another day. So we decided to troll for a bit.    James hooked into his first smallmouth and wanted a picture, at the same time time Flint wanted to go to the washroom  I did get a pic as it was going back into the drink lol    From this point on we were slaying everything that was in the lake including a ton of massive rock bass and perch on J-11's. James got another hit and said it was fighting like a huge bass. I had a thought that it was a sheephead and sure enough    After some more rockies James got another big one on. I saw a bit of it in the water, it's a pike... no it's a long skinny bass???...it's a ling! but I was still wrong after I googled it. It's a Bowfin!!! 1st from LPB    About 5 minutes later a couple CO's come up to us in their boat. I put the boat in neutral and reeled in my line. Half way in a pike slams my lure   The Co's started laughing when I asked them to come back every 20 minutes for the rest of the day.  Ryan texted me around 1:30 saying he was outta there and we left shortly after that.  I am excited that bass is open and hopefully will be out in the boat every weekend. I was great meeting up with you Shawn (SRT) and chatting. Good talking to you Ryan (The Urban Fisherman). It's too bad we couldn't meet up but you were far too busy signing autographs"
