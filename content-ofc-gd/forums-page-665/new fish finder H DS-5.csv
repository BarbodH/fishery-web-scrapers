479924,Terry,2010-06-27 13:04:00,14456,"if nI remember right, the yellow one that is with the red and black wires is if you want you can hook it up to an Acc. switch and it will work as a wake up button for the unit the other group of wires is for data connections..just tape them up you don't need them......."
479927,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-27 13:23:00,1362,"Like Terry said, if you're just using the sonar and GPS, make sure you tape each unused wire seperately and then tape them up as a bundle....I didn't do that when i first bought mine and I was getting intermittant issues with losing my GPS coordinates and water speed....I called Lowrance and the first thing they asked me was if there were any wires not being used and if so, did I tape them....I've never had any more issues since I did that..."

479932,walleyedreamer,2010-06-27 13:34:00,101,
479933,walleyedreamer,2010-06-27 13:35:00,101,yes there is two yellow wires doi tape all the do i only use the black and red all other taped septerated with electrical tape. hope that right. i have lot;s of places left on my fuse panel use the yellow with the red and black goes to the battery.still not sure what the silver wire bare one is for.
479935,irishfield,2010-06-27 13:44:00,26272,Manual is available here..  http://www.lowrance.com/en/Downloads/Manuals/  Just be sure to put the +12 from the battery thru a switch.. or the console master.. Do NOT wire it direct to the battery as shown!
479938,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-27 13:53:00,1362,Just use the RED and BLACK wires and don't forget to use an in-line fuse for protection....
479950,Terry,2010-06-27 14:45:00,14456,"the black red and yellow are on one cable..cut the yellow just where it comes out of the black cable and put some electric tape there  take the other cable cut the silver wire right where it comes out of the black cable, leave the green one, take the orange one and shorten it by a 1/8 of an inch shorten the blue by 1/4 of an inch shorten the yellow by 3/8th of an inch now take all of them and fold them back against the black cable, each one will be a different length now tape then there and never give it another thought and enjoy the HDS unit"
479951,walleyedreamer,2010-06-27 14:47:00,101,thank's it all clear now am sure am going to enjoy this unit compare to he x125 thank's again for all the tip's what would with out you guy;s on OFC
479985,gaspumper,2010-06-27 16:37:00,393,"If the unit was new there should be a manual with it that tells you where the wires go.I would follow the directions in it,to expensive a unit to hook wrong color wire to the wrong place and fry it.Thats my thoughts."
479989,bucktail,2010-06-27 16:49:00,1857,"Irishfield has a very good point, if you dont put the power thru a switch the GPS receiver will continue to draw power even when ""everything"" is off. Alot of tutorials online on the HD-S series, congrats...... Im trying to save for one now!"
