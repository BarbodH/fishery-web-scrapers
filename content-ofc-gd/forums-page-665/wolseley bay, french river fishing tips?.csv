I should have some posts and reports for others who were asking.  I really don't think there is a map of the lower French that shows the water depths and contours.   You can stop at the French River Trading Post out on Rt. 69 and get a map of the French River.  It wil show the river, fishing camps, cottages, etc, and a general outline of the river itself.  YOu may inquire at the lodge to see if they have any maps and some ""hot spots"" noted.  I know we can get one at Wolseley Lodge, but this may only be available to their guests.  I'd think the lodge owners could lead you to a few locations to try.  Not sure what the low water levels will do for fishing in that area and basic navigation.  Be very careful.  The French River is known for making a mess of a motor in a heart beat.   I just came back today from Lakair and have the scratches and dings to prove it.  Good Luck and be sure to put up a report when you get back.   Curious what I may be in for - in 2 1/2 months."
