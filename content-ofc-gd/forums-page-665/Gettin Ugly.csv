What they are doing is no different then a Kid Throwing a hissy fit.  And supporting that kind of behavior is Just ridiculous. Conspiricy this, and conspiricy that...standing behind the charter of rights whilst lighting a Police car on fire is just plain stupid.

The news only portrays what they want you to see and in all actuality, it did not go down like they say it did.

With all the money spent on security and the many thousands of police present, it was obvious they allowed the black bloc to trash Yonge St. It could have been stopped but didn't. Corrections and security is the largest growing industry in North America over last decade or so.

I watched a TV special on Womens Health Issues that was being protested. It was done very well but the demostration didnt educate anyone and really was a waste of time.  Matbe its time these demonstrations were ended because the important voices are being lost by the media and because of this group of idiots that are set on destruction.  Maybe take the billion dollars , allow the protest to commence, violence breaks out you surrond the protest ,allow the legit protestors conmtinue into another area, extracxt the jack asses, let the horses and police dogs play with them and then throw them in prison for domestic terrossim.

I am sure if a shop keeper defended his property and well being with a firearm, the police would be there in a second. 1 billion dollars and you couldnt protect vulnerable citizens property, utterly shameful!!!

Perhaps my opinion comes across as bios however I reside in Brantford and deal with violent protests on a monthly basis (or so it seems) I find it funny how people protest in Toronto like this and its news. Research what happened in Caledonia and it was tucked under the carpet like it doesnt happen. Why is this ok in Brantford and Caledonia but not ok in Toronto? There were border guards removed from their car, the car was stolen and driven into a hydro control centre destroying everything at an unbelievable cost.. Roads blocked and tries light on fire in the streets. sound familiar? at least the ""Black Bloc"" didnt bring in excavators and dig up the roads..My reactions are not ""knee jerk"" they are factual and my opinion."

The police could have stopped the person. They know who the person was. The police sat and watched only a 100 feet away. The reporters got their good shots.

I really liked that when the press quoted erroneous ""facts"" he straightened them out, very forcefully. It was well done on his part. CBC cut it off before it ended. I assumed they didn't like the way it was going. I guess they prefer their politicians to sound crooked and stupid in interviews. Mansbridge still seems determined to paint the police and the politicians in a bad light over this. I want to hear one of them ask him why he's so pro those using the black bloc tactics. If we was honest I suppose he'd have to say that it's making for a great story.  I'm impressed with a few of the people who've been interviewed. There was a Toronto city councillor whose name I missed who was very articulate. Fact is some of these interviews have made the interviewers and/or the press look kinda biased, or worse stupid.

This seems to be the result every time.  With video conferencing and the technology of today, conduct your business in this fashion.  These so called meeting cost the taxpayers billions and could be conducted so much more efficiently in other ways.  At the very least, conduct them somewhere in secret and announce the results of your meetings somewhere publicly after returning to your respective countries.  Sure you would miss a few photo ops and a few free dinners, but considering the disruption to the host countries I thin it would be well worth while.

It's really unfair to lump the Black Bloc into the same group as the legitimate protesters. The Black Bloc will do far more to undermine their efforts to be heard/taken seriously than a Billion dollars worth of Police/security. The violent forms of protest steal the limelight and obscure what could be some very meaningful protests when people start lumping all the protesters into one category. Pepper spray everybody!! G20 meetings offer a wide range of groups the opportunity to protest economic development that comes at the cost of human rights.

Far better than the media imnsho.  As I said last night I'm particularly disappointed in Mansbridge. I always thought he was one of the better talking heads but yesterday he was getting way too much mileage out of ragging on the politicians and the police. I kept wishing one of the folks being interviewed had asked him which side he was really on. I get the feeling the police chief might have given the opportunity. Mansbridge may have been trying to be subtle but he could only sneer so many times that the Mayor actually called the boys in black with masks and hammers thugs before he outed hisself. There were a few moments late in the afternoon when he almost recanted. I was wondering if perhaps someone had pointed out that he was being too obvious in his zeal to embarrass the powers that be, but then he pretty much got back on form. Seems to me a more responsible position for him to have taken was to support the police actions against the thugs and hooligans and leave the government bashing for another day. I suppose now that he lives in Stratford he's okay with Toronto as a war zone. There might even be a nice raise in it for him if he stirs the pot enuf.  In any case cudoes to you guys for acting like responsible Canadians and standing up for the good guys in this mess. Cop and politician bashing seems to be a reflex for many these days.

I have no idea what their cause is and I'm sure the majority of people don't.  Unbelieveable...and they will wonder why they get gassed and complain to anyone that will listen.  Where has common sense gone?  www.thespec.com/News/BreakingNews/article/796927  Hope nobody gets hurt  Cheers  Craig"
479735,Tdel,2010-06-26 21:08:00,393,"  Sad day for Toronto, for Ontario, for Canada.  These people are not protesters they are terrorists and should be treated as such.  You can't tell me everyone didn't know this was going to happen.  Tom"

They declared war on Toronto a long time ago and had officially stated that this weekend they will be there to destroy the fence and harm all of the police..."
479738,yakpiker,2010-06-26 21:13:00,160,They look like vandals and punks to me.  And the crowds of onlookers and media are just adding to the situation.  Hopefully only property gets damaged and nobody gets hurt.

479754,Gman,2010-06-26 22:10:00,126,This whole G8 & G20 should've been done via video/web conference like any fortune 500 company would've done and saved the tax payers billions just like it saves the companies and the investors money to help increase ROE.  That's all I've got to say on the subject.  Cheers G.
479755,ctranter,2010-06-26 22:19:00,543,"They are cowards.  The group hid amongst the peaceful protester, disguised in ""street"" clothes.  They sneak off from the group in street clothes, make a swap to all black clothes, and cause petty violence.  The goal is to promote fear and violence, not any cause or reason.  After they smash a few windows, torch some police cars they swap back to their street clothes and continue to mix in the calm crowd.  Nobody cares about their cause because nobody respects their voice.  To the men and women of the Toronto Police that keep our city safe everyday, break out that sound cannon and deafen some ""anarchists"" the next time they decide to do this."
479758,splashhopper,2010-06-26 22:28:00,2931,"just got a call 15 minutes ago from my wife and daughter all freaked out. They came out of my daughters Taekwondo tournament at Ryerson and were in the middle of it. They got in to a cab and the cab was immediately surrounded by ""protesters"" !  ""protesters"" started rocking the cab,.... the cabbie got the hell outa there  Cabbie got them to the subway system and they are now enroute to their car in North York via subway  I hope CHARGES ARE LAID AGAINST THE ""PROTESTERS"" AND ALL POWERS AFFORDED BY OUR GOVERNMENT TO THE POLICE ARE USED TO THE FULLEST WITH THESE"
479759,JohnF,2010-06-26 22:33:00,3494,"I'm more than a little disappointed in Peter Mansbridge today. It's almost like he's speaking out against basic law and order. I know it's popular for the media to be hard on the establishment but this goes way beyond simply ""speaking for the little man"" - the little man who coincidentally pays for all the tv marketing and indirectly Mansbridge's huge pay cheque - and amounts to siding with a few avowed masked anarchists who, as has been said already, have a declared purpose only to disrupt Toronto in any way possible.  He was thrilled when he got Miller to call them ""thugs"" and is now dropping it into every second line he spouts. I want someone to ask him how he would characterize the anarchists. I suppose he might call them ""entertainment"".  I'm impressed with the restraint the cops have shown. How hard do you think it is not to slap down some of those clowns as they taunt. I have no idea how the one cop (he looked Asian) didn't give the goof getting in his face a quick jab in the horn. It's obvious the anarchists want the police to retaliate or even take counter-offensive steps. They really just want to get things started and hope the ""soft"" demonstrators will get pulled into the resulting mess. Then the press can have a ball criticising the powers that be for beating up on the poor innocent peaceful demonstrators. And all the poseurs and thrill-seekers really need to rethink their prancing around in front of the police barricades and security lines. They're really just helping the anarchists to accomplish their useless ends but they're having too much fun to get it.  I wonder how many of these yahoos would show up if this conference was held in the middle of the Sahara or even on the Canadian tundra.  JF  JF"

479778,Guest gbfisher,2010-06-26 23:34:00,0,  I think you misinterpret what I have been sayin dude. I'm all for you guys busting heads of idiots who turn a somewhat tame protest into the fiasco. I've already stated I wouldnt want to be down there riot or no riot...and also stated that it give everyone the right to be a jerk....   ooops....I dint read what you said after this quote....

479781,Tdel,2010-06-26 23:42:00,393,"  Just wondering, if they declared war on Toronto a long time ago and said they would be there to destroy the fence and harm all police why doesn't the police know who is involved with this group. On the news they said that CSIS had vehicles driving around while the ""protesting"" was being done.  Surely CSIS has a file on these guys too.  So how many were arrested? I guess we will have to wait until tomorrow when they show up again.  The ""protesters"" that were jabbing police with flag staffs in the head and face were not dressed in black.  I guess these are the peaceful ones you are talking about. The only peaceful ones I saw were on the sidelines watching the terrorists do their job and doing it well.  I have a lot of respect for the police and wouldn't want their job but lately in Canada if you want to break the law just get a large group of people together and you will get away with it.  Tom."
