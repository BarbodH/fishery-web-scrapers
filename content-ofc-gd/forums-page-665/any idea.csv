479225,Pangle,2010-06-24 23:29:00,64,"there used to be a free launch right at the mouth of the gan river beside the gan inn (i havent used it in 10yrs).  Also, the marina beside the Gan Inn probably has a launch for a fee (the name eludes me at the moment, Gordons?).  40 acres is about 5-10 min from ""downtown"" Gan. depending how fast your boat is."
