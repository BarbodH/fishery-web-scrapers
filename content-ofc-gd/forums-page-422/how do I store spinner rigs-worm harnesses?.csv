684017,northernpike56,2012-04-05 19:54:00,717,"Hey guys I purchased a few spinner rigs/worm harnesses for walleye yesterday, and I was wondering how you are supposed to store them? I now have 6 spinner rigs and if I were to just put them all in my tackle box they'd be a mess and pretty well unusable. Does anybody have any suggustions/methods they use?  Thanks!!"
684021,davey buoy,2012-04-05 20:00:00,5505, I would think another tackle type box where you could lay them flat.I use different trays for different lures I use.Really no way to get around that.
684022,Nipfisher,2012-04-05 20:01:00,2449,"  2 options I use.   1) store them in the plastic sleeves that they came in (or ones from snelled hooks, etc.)     2) Lindy sells a round foam rig holder that keeps them well organized. I bought a set of 3 of them that come in a box. Each one holds about 10-12 rigs.   Here is the link to the Lindy Riggers."
684023,dave524,2012-04-05 20:02:00,4508, wrap'em around a pool noodle
684026,DaveMc,2012-04-05 20:08:00,89,right here.       
684030,ecmilley,2012-04-05 20:17:00,2163,"storing them in the package they come in or tiny zip locks is a cheap and easy way to store lots or harnesses it's when you change em up it can get messy, i store them in bulk in small zip bags and when i change them up i wrap on a lindy rigger or pool noodle ect, in the boat, I also tie up my drop shots before hand and wrap em on a rigger"

684034,Terry,2012-04-05 20:33:00,14456,"I thought you were going to tell me how to store them, not ask the question      how to store spinner rigs/worm harnesses implies you know   how do you store spinner rigs/worm harnesses is a question  even    how to store spinner rigs/worm harnesses? would help     I am not putting you down or complaining  just pointing out how many times I go to a thread and by the subject expect one thing , only to find it is something else.....   "
684035,mercman,2012-04-05 20:38:00,7054, Yup Been doing that for a while now. Works great too!!!
684043,Rod Caster,2012-04-05 21:11:00,5784,"I also purchase bulk 8x3 ziplocks from luremaking com (canadian) and put my spinners back in a bag everytime. If the bag breaks, just replace with another 5 cent bag"
684072,adempsey,2012-04-05 22:20:00,1498,"Many people use pool noodles or the Lindy Snell Holder and put those in a Plano box.   Works well, but not very compact.   I've seen others use a piece of insulation styrofoam sheeting as well.  I picked up some of those Plano harness boxes not that long ago, but didn't really like them much.  Just not compact enough for me.  In the end, I just use the small baggies from the dollar store.  Very light and much more compact.  If you want either a Lindy Snell Holder or one of those Plano harness boxes I will send one to you if you pay the postage.  I have no use for them."
684094,Nipfisher,2012-04-05 23:22:00,2449,  Here is the system I use.     Holds 36 quite nicely.
684098,Ralph Field,2012-04-05 23:33:00,1018,I will have to get the Lindy rigger kit to hold my pre tied bead set ups for steelheading. I didn't know that they made a plastic box to hold them. I have just stuffed them into my fishing bag.
684099,kickingfrog,2012-04-05 23:35:00,8333," I've used lots of different options and this is what I use now and I keep them in their own ""plano"" case. I like these because you can store extra wights and blades inside the roll (the yellow cap pops off on these, but not on some others). I use a lot of quick change clevises.  In the end you may have to try a few options because what works for one person, may not work the best for someone else."
684100,bassjnkie,2012-04-05 23:40:00,1101,  Saw this at Sail today. Great setup for sure.
684103,Nipfisher,2012-04-05 23:52:00,2449, Only holds 18 though???? I have at least 18 in chartruse.
684136,northernpike56,2012-04-06 00:53:00,717,  oops fixed that  this kinda thing is probably why I got a 76 in my english course last semester...
684137,northernpike56,2012-04-06 00:54:00,717,jeez thanks for all the quick replies guys it will really help me out!
684213,Sinker,2012-04-06 04:18:00,8692,"Yep, the lindy rigger is the only way to go.  A pool noodle with toothpicks works good too....   S."
684239,wormdunker,2012-04-06 11:37:00,1711,"Add me to the list of pool noodle users.  The Lindy rig costs approximately $10.00 (if I remember correctly) a pool noodle is only $3.00 at WalMart & U can cut them into 10"" pieces giving U 4 separate harness holders.  Pack the holders into a large tupperware container.  Works for me!"
