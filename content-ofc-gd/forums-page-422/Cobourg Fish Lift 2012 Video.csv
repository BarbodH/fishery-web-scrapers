Best of all, brought my girlfriend with me and she really had a memorable experience!  Thanks to Ron for informing the OFC(N) community with the details on the fish lift. I'm sure the Steelhead God appreciate all the good work done by the MNR staff, Ganaraska conservation staff and all the volunteers who came out to help.

Next time, introduce yourself and I will let you take video footage on the work involved above as well!  It's nice to see the documentation like that.  Cheers, Ron..."
