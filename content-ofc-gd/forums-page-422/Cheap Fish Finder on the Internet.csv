683586,rhymobot,2012-04-04 15:29:00,174,"Hi.  I have an inflatable boat with a trolling motor and only fish on small lakes that aren't too deep. Like Mountsberg, Valens, Wilcox, Little Lake (Midland), Orangeville Reservoir, Heart Lake, Fairy Lake (Acton), Puslinch, Guelph, etc.  Never used a fish finder before and since I'm not serious enough to spend on a proper boat and all my rod combos cost $20-$25, do you think this is good value for $36?  http://www.aliexpres...holesalers.html   I wonder if all fish the sonar finds are gonna show up as the exact same size on the screen. Meaning it could have found me a school of sunfish instead of the bass and pike I'm looking for. Do good fish finders differentiate in the size of the fish?   I've ordered stuff from this site a few times and for this product there's been a lot of people who've bought and a lot of positive feedback.  Thanks."
683594,Raf,2012-04-04 15:37:00,3495,"fish finders (especially in that price range) don't find fish, they tell you how deep you are and (hopefully) the water temp.  they should really be called depth finders.  yes, a more expensive unit can differentiate between the size of whatever it detects."
683600,johnnyb,2012-04-04 15:59:00,3413,"All you need to know is where the depth changes, where any humps are, so if it tells you the depth and is easy to use, for $36 I'd say go for it."
683742,d_paluch,2012-04-04 22:46:00,343,"I'm with johnnyb!  I have a Humminbird piranhamax 160, and realistically all I use it for is depth/structure and water temp. It does see fish...but that's really only useful when vertical jigging or icefishing. The only problem with that sonar is that there is a possibility it just doesn't work, that or it eats batteries"
683743,d_paluch,2012-04-04 22:50:00,343,"ps*  good luck using a finder properly in Mountsberg come mid summer, the weed growth is unreal, that and there really isn't any need to use it @ Mountsberg..I mean you can see the bottom almost everywhere you fish"
683748,Terry,2012-04-04 23:05:00,14456,I think you would be better off looking at garage sales for a real used fishfinder  I think a string with a weight on the end would give you more info then cheap finders
683749,Woodsman,2012-04-04 23:05:00,1286,"Save your money. Spend a little more & you'll be far happier. For between $100 - $150 you'll get a unit 10 X more capable. A new $100 unit today is better than a $300 unit from 10 years ago. More power, more pixels and better processor. The $36 unit you posted list none of these specs. Screen size is also quite small. About 2"" by 2""."

683824,googie,2012-04-05 02:57:00,23,  I agree
