Something tells me its a shakespear trolling rod from around the 1950s or so. Ive been browsing the net and havent seen any like it so far, perhaps I wasnt on the right pages.  Any info about it would greatly be apreciated, thanks in advance. "

684289,camillj,2012-04-06 14:15:00,1988,Looks like and old-school ice fishing rod to me ... how long is it ?
684290,skeeter99,2012-04-06 14:18:00,109,   nothing special at all from late 50's to early 60's very very common it is a down rigger/trolling rod I have 14 of the exact same ones from my wifes grandfather from trolloing on lake O they are worth at best $10 a peice or if you can find someone that thinks it's old and worth something you might get $20  there are some on kijiji  http://northbay.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-other-Old-Trolling-Rods-W0QQAdIdZ363225264
684300,Spiel,2012-04-06 14:46:00,9065,"Hard to tell from the small pictures but best guess is it appears to be an old trolling rod (not downrigging) for copper/steel line designed to drag gang trolls (Christmas trees, Cow Bells) for Lake Trout.   Very common and easy to find at most flea markets."
684335,OhioFisherman,2012-04-06 15:52:00,6623," Yep, old school and quite common to see at flea markets."
684364,Leecher,2012-04-06 17:53:00,7832, That was my first though too... looks similar to this one    I have 2 of them and use them for ice fishing... it's 20 years old and still kicking
