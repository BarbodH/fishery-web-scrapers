683437,Roy,2012-04-04 00:11:00,13728,You really should read a few of the other threads before posting.
683438,Joeytier,2012-04-04 00:15:00,3990,"Quick, go get it while it's a steal!  If my tank was bone dry, it would make less than a 4 dollar difference for me"
683450,BillM,2012-04-04 01:14:00,17367,"70 litre fill you'll save $2.80.  So hurry up, go wait in line idling for an hour!!!   People crack me up."
683453,Rod Caster,2012-04-04 01:18:00,5784,"You should have hoarded gas in December 2008, much better deal."
683456,NANUK,2012-04-04 01:23:00,797, That's pretty funny to watch people bent out of shape and line up at the pumps so they can save a couple of $$ on a full tank of gas Then they go inside and buy a 500ml bottle of water for $1.49
683473,irishfield,2012-04-04 01:55:00,26272,  I use to almost fill the '69 Bee's tank for that $2.80 Bill.. with nice red leaded premium! That said.. I always get a good chuckle when there's a 10 minute back up on the CTC pumps at $127.7 and nobody is slowing me down across the street at Zehrs for $127.9 !
683481,Rizzo,2012-04-04 02:07:00,4754,"what a world, put over $150 in the truck a few days back. Absolutely criminal"
683528,Whitespinnerbait,2012-04-04 09:41:00,2038,Even if Gas goes to $ 2.00 a liter....I mean really who cares !!!
683540,jedimaster,2012-04-04 11:35:00,3472,"Sorry roy, I was on the mobile version and did a scan and didn't see anything, when I got home I saw the other thread... On the mobile version the second line of the posts don't show up. ""Here we go again"" is not very descriptive....  Anyway when I filled up the jeep from a 1/4 tank it took 70 to fill. Better than waiting to friday and putting in 75 or 80. Why give them more if I don't have to?  Funny thing is I moved to the city to cut down on the commute, I went from 1000km's a week just to work and back 5 days a week to 80km's a week. 8km's one way. I decided in the summer would try riding the bike to work, I am a bit hesitant due to the fear of getting flattened by a driver, but I think the gas price change will motivate me to make the change....at least for one day."

683808,danc,2012-04-05 01:49:00,4677,Lowest price in the province is 5 minutes from home at $1.14. And I get another 20 cents or so off of that price.
683816,LefroyFisherman,2012-04-05 02:13:00,602,well said Kipawa Jim! absolute crap! I drive about 5000kms a month for work. The oil companies are making billions in profits!
