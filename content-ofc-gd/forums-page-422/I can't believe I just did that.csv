683825,ch312,2012-04-05 02:57:00,1590,"the front yard has been 100% green for over a week and ive cut the grass 3 times in the last couple weeks and it'll be due again this weekend. really sucks as i'm not a fan of grass.  unfortunately, it won't be long and it'll be back to mowing the lawn twice a week. any ideas how to get it to slow down some? seriously."
683848,Billy Bob,2012-04-05 09:40:00,5865, YES......one year I sprayed the back yard with Roundup thinking it was WeedBGone.........in 2 weeks I had a lot of brown areas that didn't need mowing the rest of the year...
683610,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 16:25:00,5865,"Wow.......I just finished mowing my lawn and it's only April 4th....  ...I should of mowed it last week but I try to put off as LONG as possible....because we all know that once you do it, it grows faster and faster....I was hoping to put it off at least another week and (I always try to get to May 1st but never do) Vegas is calling me this week and I didn't want to come home a millionaire and have to use a sickle on my lawn....  So, any of you guys from the Great White North mowing yet....or do you still have the snow blower on stand by..."
683611,captpierre,2012-04-04 16:26:00,2521,Nope.  Not yet in Stouffville.  In TO likely
683612,tb4me,2012-04-04 16:28:00,3295,Same here Bob..Should have cut it a week ago but still havet..lol Have to get the mower out tonight..
683613,mercman,2012-04-04 16:31:00,7054,"Not here yet either.Hardly any snow cover this winter, so the frost went deep, and probably stunted the early growth. soon thought."
683614,Court R,2012-04-04 16:37:00,213,"Cut mine last week, i'm in Niagara.."
683621,Pikeslayer,2012-04-04 16:52:00,1443,I think my wife is planning on cutting it this weekend.
683622,Lunker777,2012-04-04 16:53:00,866,I could have cut mine 3 weeks ago... The lawn mower business has been INSANE this year due to the weather.... We cant keep up with servicing mowers and keeping the new ones delivered on time !  I still need to get on my lawn though... trying to go as long as possible ahhaha Im in Chatham
683629,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 17:22:00,5865," Oh, I see you are living by the Redneck rules....wife does all the mowing during fishing season.....and she does EVERYTHING during the hunting season..."
683635,Pikeslayer,2012-04-04 17:57:00,1443," Nope, not Redneck rules Bob. She just loves cutting the grass (and blowing snow). Works out well though because I really appreciate her letting me look after the laundry. I just love laundry. And baking. Oh, and don't get me going on crafting!!! Crafting, crafting, crafting. I love crafting."
683637,shane,2012-04-04 18:02:00,652,I just water mine with beer and it comes up already half cut.
683641,bigugli,2012-04-04 18:09:00,6138,An occassional spritz of B-9 on the lawn should keep it from growing for weeks (lol)
683642,whiskywizard,2012-04-04 18:17:00,305,  Can mine get lessons?
683649,BillM,2012-04-04 18:35:00,17367,"BB, wanna come up and help me thatch this weekend? LOL!"
683650,Spiel,2012-04-04 18:38:00,9065,"A female dog ensures I never have to cut the back lawn, truth is I can't even get to to grow."
683680,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 19:34:00,5865," Let me see.........on one hand I could help BillyM thatch his lawn and hope he would give me FREE beer.....I'm pretty sure he would...  But on the other hand I could be here getting FREE drinks all day long...   What to do....what to do this weekend....  Sorry Billy.......Lady Luck and her 4 sisters are calling me to Sin City, U.S.A.  But good luck on that thatching......sounds like a real fun day...."
683681,jim,2012-04-04 19:36:00,124,Geez!!    You guys haven't been cutting your grass?!
683683,HTHM,2012-04-04 19:38:00,4082,"With 1.5 acres to cut, I don't worry about thatching or aerating or fertilizing even. So long as it is green."
683685,OhioFisherman,2012-04-04 19:44:00,6623,"I did mine last week, my dog is short and was getting lost. I have leaves on my willow and maple trees. All the shrubs in the back field have leaves on them."
683688,Rattletrap2,2012-04-04 19:58:00,1652," Trust me Bob, them drinks ain't free!! If you are not paying for them....someone sure as hell is!!"
683689,capt bruce,2012-04-04 20:02:00,820,"""I can't believe I just did that NF "" Thought this was a post about Billy helping out an old lady across the street, or giveing a small child some candies or just being NICE in general ... lmao ...."
683691,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 20:08:00,5865," HEY, don't mess up my mojo......I fly THOUSANDS of miles each year to get them there FREE drinks....."
683692,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 20:09:00,5865," I do that EVERY Tuesday as I drive around our senior citizens to the bank, grocery store and doctor appointments....when was the last time you did something similar...."
683703,capt bruce,2012-04-04 20:36:00,820,"Every Time I drive my fat ASS to the store or dont fall down crossing the street , I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN .. LOL ...
