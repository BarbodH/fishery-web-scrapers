683925,BITEME,2012-04-05 15:34:00,1968,"LONDON - Jim Marshall, who helped shape the sound of rock with his groundbreaking amplifier designs, has died. He was 88.   His son Terry Marshall said he died in a hospice in England on Thursday morning after suffering from cancer and several severe strokes.  Jim Marshall was known throughout the music world for founding Marshall Amplification, which produced the amplifiers that rocked music halls and arenas after their introduction in 1960.  Photographs from the era show many of rock's most illustrious guitarists performing in front of stacks of Marshall amplifiers.  Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page and others were drawn to the rough, loud sound produced by the English-made amps.  Rest in Peace.....Thanks"

683990,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-05 18:19:00,0,100% HH.  it's not uncommon for gents like be to use the 1965b 4x10 as a 6 string rig.  the GL10's are a great speaker although i had to replace one side at one point. http://c0.dmlimg.com/1fc1c1c2db5852e08ffc380475e263363ce38ea221336ea6fa5c75bb230f49ca.jpg

683993,Ainsley,2012-04-05 18:42:00,142,RIP a true legend. I've played many Marshall amps but never owned one. My Bogner Shiva is modeled after a hotrodded Marshall and has an amazing tone.
