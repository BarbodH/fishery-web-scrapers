683147,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-03 03:32:00,0, is that why we keep shipping jobs overseas?
683152,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-03 03:47:00,0,"we aren't just shipping out manufacturing jobs anymore either!  as sad as it is, recently a call centre company (yes you heard me right) in sault ste. marie/st catherines shipped their call centres overseas.  apparently we can't even keep minimum wage jobs in the country!"
683153,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-03 03:48:00,0, it's those tiny hands the kids have... they are so good at delicate work!
683171,outllaw,2012-04-03 09:25:00,1232,"competition is fine. dumping from asia is not. i will buy here in canada, if not available or built here i buy u.s. products. as for border crossing that is a stopgap to appease peasant shoppers.  goverments and corporations are controlling masters..as for quality for dollar value i am still laughing. i dont put any value in the dollarama,s lol."
683176,Billy Bob,2012-04-03 10:44:00,5865, RECENTLY.....  call centers have been working out of India for about a decade or more...you're spending too much time fishing steelhead with a magnet....
683182,danbouck,2012-04-03 10:58:00,4380,"If anyone here actually ordered parts or whatnot from China you would realize that you can get whatever quality you want. I get better quality parts from China for half the price. If anybody wants proof you are welcome in my shop any day.  I'm all for keeping jobs over here. Ordering from China allows me to keep mine.  Thanks BB, maybe I'll come over and do some shopping."
683532,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 11:00:00,5865,"BTW Boys and Girls........you to Fisherman.....LOL....the word must really be out as I was at the Galleria Mall yesterday and a HUGE Trail Lines bus from Ontario was there with a whole bus load of your fellow citizens buying everything in sight....then while I was sitting in the van a nice middle age lady came up to the van window to ask me a question.....she wanted to know where Kolh's is....when I told her to take Walden Ave, right on Transit Rd and keep driving a ways until you pass Walmart, she said GREAT we want to go to Walmart too.....  I think I just felt a small bump in our local economy...."
683534,Fisherman,2012-04-04 11:06:00,7201," Sure thing BB, Buy amerinese, keep shooting yourself in your feet, pretty soon you'll fall flat on your donkey and wonder what happened."
683779,grimsbylander,2012-04-05 00:44:00,3016,"I think it's fantastic a few people on this site have managed to buy all their home electronics, clothing, cell phones and fishing tackle without having to waste money on offshore junk."
683895,bigbuck,2012-04-05 13:53:00,2449,"It's unfortunate that our retailers can't compete with their brethren just south of the border. We need to get our act together here in North America. We are losing all of the good paying jobs to Asia. One of the big problems now is who in their right mind would want to TRY to build a manufacturing plant in North America, with all of the red tape, environmental regs, etc... the cost is way too prohibitive. Our bureaucracy has run amok and is hindering job growth. It has gotten to the point of waaaay too much regulation. I wonder how much radiation I take in now crossing the border. All of those x-ray machines, bomb sniffers, nuclear material detectors, etc.... can't be good for us. It's unfortunate that a few bad apples have ruined it for everyone."
683911,Billy Bob,2012-04-05 14:57:00,5865, BINGO.....Thank You for recognizing that.....and the worst part is there are even more government regs in the works.....between union demands and government regulations you can stick a fork in us in North America...were done....
682846,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 10:30:00,5865,"Come one, come all for deals up the wazoo....LOL.....  http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article791390.ece"
682852,Fisherman,2012-04-02 11:13:00,7201,"Same Chinese junk your store or mine, save the gas and stay here."
682854,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 11:20:00,5865, TRUE......but now you will no longer pay the 4% sales tax on your footwear and clothing here.....
682882,outllaw,2012-04-02 13:25:00,1232,deals where. when you haveto deal with border gestapo why.the detroit tunnel or ambassador bridge homeland idiots have taken the adventure out of the equation.
682900,Fisherman,2012-04-02 14:18:00,7201,"Unless you are pedalling your    to get there, it still takes gas which is a lot more than the cheesy 4%.   $4 on $100, waste of time, gas, wear and tear on nerves."
682906,Roy,2012-04-02 14:30:00,13728,"Thanks for the heads up, Bob. It's not really worth my while because of the distance but for the times when I might already be there, it could be worth my while."
682907,Beans,2012-04-02 14:34:00,3339,I believe the Federales budget increased the $ amounts you can purchase in the US without paying duty...
682916,John,2012-04-02 14:57:00,2956,"Thanks Bob, I pretty much always buy my clothes south of the border. Much better selection, sizes that actually fit and generally 50-60% of the price of the same stuff here.  I am a big buy in Canada supporter, but, there is a limit...."
682919,bubbles,2012-04-02 15:05:00,591, True story  I find it interesting that the US economy suffers along with ours and both our govenments are focused on fixing the US economy and no one is fucused on Canada.  How can allowing Canadians to spend more money in a foreign country tax free help the Canadian economy in any way?
682923,woodenboater,2012-04-02 15:14:00,2277, ^ This. Can only hurt border towns even more.
682925,bigugli,2012-04-02 15:15:00,6138,It doesn't
682971,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 18:49:00,5865," Beans, You got that correct as you must of read the article I posted....where many just pissed and moaned instead of taking the time to READ....  I agree it doesn't make sense for many who have to travel a long ways to get over the boarder...however, if you you're making a trip anyways....well then it does make sense....And ""Fisherman"".....you can also buy LESS expensive gasoline here on the same trip....that's like double dipping partner...LOL...  Back in the 70's I use to buy less expensive gasoline in Fort Erie...sometimes even see the Canadian Ballet while I was there, as I really enjoy the fine arts that Fort Erie had to offer..."
682974,Grimace,2012-04-02 19:01:00,2020,We are getting shafted by the stores up here.  The government upping the daily limit to 200 bucks will hopefully smarten our merchants up and force them to compete.
682985,Uncle Buck,2012-04-02 20:15:00,1000,nobody show this to my wife please!!!!
682990,Fisherman,2012-04-02 20:26:00,7201,"Yes, I understood that in our last budget we now have a higher tax free limit. Let me rattle your head a bit.  I have to drive about 150 Miles one way, 300 round trip, plus a bit around town add about another 30 miles or so.  330 miles or about 11 Imp gallons, maybe 14 or so US, about $65.  That's to get me there and back, no food, no lodging for the two days (48 hours) I have to stay across the border to get the benefit, add a couple hundred for food and lodging.  So I spend about $260 at a minimum just for the trip, I haven't bought anything yet.  Are you beginning to see..I'll keep the $260 and spend it here and support MY country."
682995,misfish,2012-04-02 21:01:00,29133,"Both goverments need to work on this passport crap.After all,we are neighbors."
682998,bigugli,2012-04-02 21:21:00,6138,"YOu know the old saying....""Fences make the best neighbours"""
683003,woodenboater,2012-04-02 21:30:00,2277,"Reading all this, I have no idea how spending money in the states, tax free, is helping our economy. The cynical would say this is a covert way to keep wages low, if our dollar can be stretched then we don't need proper, fare wages. Kinda like shopping at the Big Blue store with greeters. People can cross border shop with fewer taxes, but at what cost to our communities ?"
683004,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 21:31:00,5865, OK....I get it...your cheap.....LOL....  ...just kidding..  But you do realize when I post something like this there are many members here that live right on the boarder or come to the U.S.A. for many reasons....so I didn't just post this for you....
683006,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 21:33:00,5865, I believe you guys now have the Enhanced Driver's License thing....Right...  ...I don't have a passport either but I do have the EDL thing...
683009,misfish,2012-04-02 21:36:00,29133,"  My point is ""WHY"" should this be BB? Were not the bad guys."
683012,Fisherman,2012-04-02 21:51:00,7201,"Not cheap, just frugal enough to believe that I'm #1 and have to look out for my interest.  If I support your country through buying and taxes, does your country support my pension, highly doubt it.  That's why I tend to slightly dissect things and make them look the way they really are, not just the polished exterior that so many people get suckered into.  Those that are border dwellers may profit in the short run, in the long run they don't do us any favours."
683013,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 21:53:00,5865," I agree 100%......so next time over, just tell them you know me...  As a matter of fact we were discussing of taking down the custom inspections at work one day....that was about 3-4 months just prior to 9/11....my one buddy has race horses in Fort Erie and I mentioned what a hassle it is to stop and tell them where I was born and how long I'm going to stay in Canada....I thought ""who cares where I was born, etc..."" but then 9/11 happened and now we live in this era...."
683016,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 21:56:00,5865, SO....when is the last time you purchased something that was NOT made in China.....it's a global economy....at least they keep telling us that....so make it work for you.....not you work for it.
683144,blaque,2012-04-03 03:20:00,2419, Imagine that
