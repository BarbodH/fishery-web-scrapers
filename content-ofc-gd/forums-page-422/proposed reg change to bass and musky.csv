684192,Rich Nelson,2012-04-06 02:54:00,332," Ill take that bet. How exactly is it making people suffer,or change their lives? And every study shows there is a mortality rate? Maybe 1 in 100 fish for a true Musky angler. As top of the food chain, they exist in low numbers. Same as lions, tigers etc. absolutely no Good reason to ever keep one, and there should be no possession limit all across Ontario. Guess you shouldnt comment on things you know nothing about...."

All kidding aside ... last time I killed a Musky was before I knew how long they took to reach the trophy size (and back in the day they were still considered a pest likely to harm the pickeral populations ... seriously, how could anyone want to kill anything that takes upwards of 50 years to reach legal 'table' size ... thats just not sustainable."
684232,Terry,2012-04-06 10:36:00,14456,"   show me a study that shows 1% you just made this stuff up and you say to me ""Guess you shouldn't comment on things you know nothing about..."" LOOK WHO IS CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK show me your study that state 1 %..... come on don't be shy  but lets just say you are right  1 % .... would he get 100 fish;; so he killed 1 fish the average guy..does he get one muskie a year so 1 fish 100% mortality ..both killed 1 fish  well that's a tie no one wins but if a gill is ripped , that he has not control ..if a fish gets away..he didn't carefully cut the hooks out and baby that fish ..it will die ...  sorry you statement that you just made up doesn't hold water.....  and I stand by my statement that the right to keep fish for the table should never be removed...      trophy muskellunge. Average annual mortality rate in trophy muskellunge populations ranged from 16% to 26%, which corresponds to maximum ages of 26 to 16 years, respectively. • Data from the Cleithrum Project indicate that, over the past 16 years, maximum age of trophy muskellunge may have decreased two years (23 to 21), reflecting an increase in annual mortality rate from 18% to 20%. • If annual mortality rate of record-sized muskellunge 25 to 30 years old were increased by 2%, it would be necessary to double recruitment to compensate for this change. • Harvest reduction and catch-and-release procedures, which reduce mortality, are an easier and more cost-effective way of maintaining and restoring trophy muskellunge populations than trying to supplement recruitment by stocking. If the mortality rate of large muskellunge 21 to 23 years old can be decreased by only 2% (20% to 18%), this is comparable to increasing their initial recruitment by approximately 70%.   How exactly is it making people suffer,or change their lives  my point was if you like to eat muskie or any other fish and they put a ban on keeping them it can, it will affect their lives..surely you can see that..for some people fish in the bucket is money in the bank and they fish to help put food on the table,,there for it affects their life...this person has to change his life in some small ways to be a good conservationist..... you understand... and then you have a muskie guide...if they make it c/r only... he has more fish to catch he has happier customers , he has more money in his bank.. this guy has to do nothing to be a good conservationist....it puts money in his bank it's a self-serving act...and it is pretty easy to say lets make these great changers when it does not adversely affect you if he said lets quit fishing muskie to help protect this great fish..then he is hurting his bottom line and you can respect that...if he said lets have a 5 year clsed season on muskie fishing then he's a conservationist but his statements are self-serving wallet building propaganda"
684252,farsider,2012-04-06 12:52:00,456," Even with the associated low mortality linked to C/R efforts, Muskie mortality will continue to occur.  Unless the body of water becomes a sanctuary which I think we can agree is not what anybody would prefer. Incidental catches, lost lures from walleye/bass anglers, commercial by-catch, natural causes, and nefarious means will still contribute to annual mortality.  One argument I think you could make is the annual mortality rate (even for meal fisherman)would eventually go down if consumption goes up because catch-rates including incidental would plummet.  I never argued for banning consumption.  I personally think you would have to be brain-damaged to eat a legal-sized Muskie(which incidentally is a sympton of Mercury poisoning) but, I wouldn't argue for an outright ban.  I think both goals are achieved with higher minimum limits and thus agree with the proposed reg. changes.  I just think they didn't go far enough.  My goal would be an 80"" minimum.  Here is a study with a 0% mortality rate.  C/R Mortality study  Granted it was ""average"" Muskies Canada anglers with the education, tools, and experience to properly handle Muskies but it does show that it is possible if unlikely.

683940,mike rousseau,2012-04-05 15:59:00,4661,  zone 20 is a lot bigger then just the lower niagra...  and someone has to take the first step...
683956,Musky or Specks,2012-04-05 16:42:00,2710,I guess my point is fish don't recognize borders. The St Lawrence is also a border water that fish probably migrate frequently from one side to another. I agree all musky fishing should be C&R but I'd hate for our waters to become the nursery for an American trophy harvest.

684151,pooch,2012-04-06 01:28:00,139,"Here is a little background on the bass regulation change for FMZ 17. I sit on the advisory council for FMZ 17. Below is my interpretation of data that was presented to council.  Bass are climate change ""winners"". Over the last century temperatures have increased and these increases have translated into ice out dates on average 10 days earlier. Extra days of soft water means longer growing cycles for bass before winter sets in, and bass populations are thriving especially in FMZ 17.  Also, research shows that when spawning season begins there is a bias towards large fish, meaning the largest fish in the population (the ones that need the most protection through regulations) spawn before the smaller fish. Any nest that is still occupied by the opener are most often small males guarding empty nests. Current regulations protect bass almost entirely throughout their spawning season in FMZ 17.  Two of the main reasons we have fishing regulations are: 1. protect the resource and 2. to provide fishing opportunities. In short, the biologist that presented for the FMZ 17 council concluded that opening bass one week earlier would not negatively impact the spawning season of bass and it would provide increased fishing opportunities for anglers; a win, win situation so to speak.  One side benefit of opening bass season one week earlier is that it may give the walleye another week ""off"", as many bass anglers often target walleye before the bass season opens.  I hope that answers many of the questions that may arise."
