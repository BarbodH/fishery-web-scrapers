I tried my first time out of Chrystal Beach in the summer and had a blast but not sure ""when the bite starts "" or where they start.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.    Darren"
684279,Woodsman,2012-04-06 13:57:00,1286,Most eyes in Erie run to the west end of the lake & then up to the Thames to spawn. Generally not a good spring bite. Good bite moves east as the year progresses.

A shallow inshore fishery exists at this end of Erie that seems to start b4 the typical suspended fish offshore Erie walleye pattern in late May early June. This end typically produces better earlier and by August you need to move west."
