My buddy Garnet came along...we got a limit, a few swapped up and not as big as the other day but fish for supper...cant be beat.  Another good thing is my I-pilot arrived while i was in Winnipeg and it worked seamlessly! Locking on the spot and just fishing is amazing, i still dont trust it even though it held us withing inches of our spot all afternoon. All this effortless fishing will take a little while to adjust to.  I now have the lock spot function figured out and am getting to like the Advanced auto-pilot feature (auto-pilot with GPS assist). We had fun saving a lock spot...moving a few hundred yards away then making the boat find it...cool. Next time out i am gonna familiarise myself with recording tracks....will be awesome on a few weedlines i know when the weeds arrive.

Very nice work on the fish sir....next time maybe you won't hesitate so long when you have a chance to leave work so early"
