They went last month and had a ball.  She recently entered another radio contest and has won again.  This time it's an another all inclusive trip for 2 and now she's off to Los Angeles. They get airfare, limo service, hotels and all meals, plus $500 cash.  While there they take in the seasons final taping of The Big Bang Theory and then go back stage to meet the cast of the show.  I think I better get that girl to start buying me some lottery tickets"
