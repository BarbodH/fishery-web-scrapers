681575,captpierre,2012-03-29 16:25:00,2521,That's crazy.  I need to use bigger lures!  peter
681578,mike rousseau,2012-03-29 16:28:00,4661,  yeah... the added stress of taking pictures and measurements of the fish out of the water wasnt great for the fishes well being...especially in this situation...  but then again neither was the 5 pound drum stuck in its mouth...lol  hope it survived

681582,DoubleDigits,2012-03-29 16:31:00,140,how about this one for a case of eyes bigger than the stomach

683994,davey buoy,2012-04-05 18:59:00,5505,"Good for you guys,the sheephead will be picked up by a bird or something?. The fact is if you did nothing the musky was done, I would think anyways."
