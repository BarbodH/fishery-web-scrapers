684000,JustinHoffman,2012-04-05 19:19:00,482,"Hello All,  For those that read yesterday's report, I ventured out once again this morning in search of grouse to photograph...and hoping for another deer shed.  Headed back to the area that I found the previous shed. Begin doing a grid search in a 100 yard radius, but came up empty handed. Did see three ""live"" deer, though...as well as a few turkey.  On a hunch, and after doing some research and taking some advice from those that posted on my thread yesterday, I headed to an area approximately 600 yards due east. This spot is a thick (up top at least) area of evergreens, and if I had to guess, would be the ideal bedding area for deer. I began searching the perimeter, then the middle, and finally the outside edge. Then, as I walked along the edge....I saw it! Another beauty shed, glistening in the sun, right at the edge of the evergreens and adjacent to a marsh. (And less than 200 yards from Highway 416!)    This shed is much darker than the first, and, although I am no expert when it comes to scoring, would appear to be six points. One tine is broken, and there is a drop tine coming off of that. Amazingly, their is not a single nibble or gnaw on this shed!  Here is where it was found - it is in the lower right hand corner:    And here are the two - side by side for comparison. The latest is much stockier than the first, has more points, is more aged, and the ""ball"" at the end is larger. Leading me to believe these came from two different deer. Any expert opinions out there??    Hiked a total of 26.4 km's the past three days. Had some incredible interactions with grouse...and found my first two deer sheds! I'm pretty much on cloud nine  Cheers,  Justin"

684049,richyb,2012-04-05 21:44:00,774,Yep 2 different deer for sure. That Big one sure would be a dandy to see walking around with that cool kicker sticking out the back. Those 2 deer could be father and son. They are similar in shape and that little bit of a paddle near the tips.
684086,farsider,2012-04-05 22:55:00,456,"Sweeeet!   Wtg Justin!  Very cool non-typical six point.  I am no expert but, I agree that these came from two different bucks.  Large difference in mass, colouration, and brow tines.  Cheers,  Mark"

684132,JustinHoffman,2012-04-06 00:46:00,482,"Thanks, guys! Now I am excited to try to find the other two to make the matches. Few other spots I haven't checked yet, including a corn field and another field with long grasses that they feed in/possibly bed down in.  Equally excited to head to this spot come fall - with camera in tow to try to get some pics of these brutes...  Cheers,  Justin"
