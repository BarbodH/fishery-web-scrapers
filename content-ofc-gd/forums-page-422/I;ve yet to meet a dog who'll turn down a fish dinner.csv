683452,bigugli,2012-04-04 01:16:00,6138,Sorry for the lopsided pics. I pre edited and rotated the pics but Photobucket seems screwed up at the moment.

683569,limeyangler,2012-04-04 13:44:00,5204,LOL......nice Bruce.  Cute pups.  my dog is definitely giving the cats a run for their money at walleye cleaning time!
683633,bigugli,2012-04-04 17:47:00,6138,"It was necessary to return the beagle to the shelter. Her previous owner must have beaten the dog a lot because it was terrified of my cane, and would yelp and howl with every bump and noise. Not the best circumstances in an apertment. The fellow running the shelter did not realize she was that badly spooked either, but Molly was happy as all get out to be back at the shelter."
683702,Ralph Field,2012-04-04 20:28:00,1018," I'm sorry that Molly didn't work out for you. Our rescue dog,a look alike to Molly, can't be left alone in the house so we have to hire a dog sitter whenever we go out together."
