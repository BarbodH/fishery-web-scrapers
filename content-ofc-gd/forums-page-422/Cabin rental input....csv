Nice package deal for two nights with boat/motor for $380. The second is Harris Lake Marina. A little cheaper, but can't find any info on fishing reports or reviews. The time of year will be second last weekend in May or first 2 weekends in June. Target species will be pike, and some attempts at walleye although neither of us at all experienced with them. Thanks for your help, Jesse  "

I'm also open to other suggestions up around the same area.  We're big fans of the famous G-Bay sunsets/sunrises and experienced with that sort of structure etc. so we would like something in and around the Bay.  But again, all suggestions will be researched. Thanks again,"
