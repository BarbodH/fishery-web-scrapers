Also read somewhere that some motors have thermostats that open up and allow water through...  not sure if this is the case with my motor? was down out the marina talking with them.  mechanic wasn't in and lady didn't know...  i did blow air through the pee hole a few times, so it shouldn't be blocked...  any ideas?"

683740,Rizzo,2012-04-04 22:42:00,4754,depending on temps some motors take a bit of time before they pee out. When I'm out in freezing temps I've seen it 30-45 seconds (which feels like an eternity when you're watching).
