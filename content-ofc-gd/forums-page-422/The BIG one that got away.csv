683001,camillj,2012-04-02 21:24:00,1988,"We were ""mugged"" by a few Humpbacks while in Maui last week ... I got some really cool video as one of them decided to show off right underneath our Zodiak on a 2 hr whale-watching tour ... BEST EXPERIENCE EVER ... if you have a choice definitely go on the Zodiak over the bigger boats .. NOTHING comes close to this ... we had whales playing around us for the ENTIRE 2 hrs !   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uooozoV9LyI&feature=relmfu  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xa7Oc5o0OlQ&feature=relmfu"

683320,BITEME,2012-04-03 18:51:00,1968,Use to love sitting in the sonar room and listening to them communicate. VERY VERY HUMBLING!!!!  We are not alone!!!!!
683333,fishnsled,2012-04-03 19:31:00,3520,Very cool!
683431,Moosebunk,2012-04-04 00:01:00,3970,Whales were cool but you being in Maui is even cooler.
683746,camillj,2012-04-04 23:01:00,1988,"Thanks folks ... Lew, they should be around for another few weeks at least ... Between Maui and Lanai was AMAZING (about 25 miles from the big island of Hawaii... definitely a lifetime experience.  I didnt post these because we didnt actually catch em .. but for your viewing pleasure here's a link with some nice fish we saw come in ... and managed to steal a photo-opp ...  http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=10151478990145019&set=a.10151478986860019.840400.845145018&type=3&theater  http://www.facebook.com/#!/photo.php?fbid=10151478997365019&set=a.10151478986860019.840400.845145018&type=3&theater  By the way for $165 I spent a QUALITY 6 hrs (6 AM - NOON) chasing Blue Marlin with a couple of the most seasoned guides on the island (Pier 7 in Lahaina on the island of Maui)... worth every penny ! (and Whales/Dolphins were a bonus for viewing pleasure)."
