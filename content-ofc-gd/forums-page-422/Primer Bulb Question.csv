681929,Uncle Buck,2012-03-30 13:30:00,1000,I'm gonna be starting up the boat pretty soon...  Is there any trick to getting the gas up quicker with the primer bulb?  I gave her about 20 squeezes yesterday and still didn't see any gas in the filter...  It's a built in/inboard gas tank...  the primer bulb was new last year and this is my first time with an built in/inboard gas tank...  any help is appreciated

681963,whiskywizard,2012-03-30 15:21:00,305,"If you've got the fuel line connected at both the tank end and the engine end, there's no way the ball seals can be stuck shut. The tank fitting and engine fitting both are male fittings that force the balls back from the o-rings mechanically.  If you've got ample fuel in the tank and you've pumped it a lot and it's not moving fuel, the check valve in the bulb may have failed, or you hav e asuction leak at the o-ring on the tank-end fitting. The o-ring can be replaced. You can buy just the bulb, or a complete set. If the old hose is stiff or you've had leqaks at the fittings, I'd suggest a full hose set"

682016,davey buoy,2012-03-30 18:17:00,5505,"Check the directional arrows on the primer ball,and as said make sure every thing is tight"

682920,Garnet,2012-04-02 15:06:00,2056,If it's efi they have a fuel pump just turn key on and you will hear the pump.

683195,fish_fishburn,2012-04-03 11:34:00,1311,"Hmmm my 175 Merc EFI has a primer bulb. A couple of pumps before the initial start up and I am usually good for the day. But every once in awhile, usually on a really hot day it will need to be primed again for easy starting."
683722,Uncle Buck,2012-04-04 21:28:00,1000,boat was on a sloped driveway... wasnt sucking in any gas...  turned it around in the driveway with motor on the lower side and a bunch of squeezes and all was good...
