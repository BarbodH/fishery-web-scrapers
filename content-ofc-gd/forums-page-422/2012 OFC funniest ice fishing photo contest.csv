657342,Roy,2012-01-17 12:25:00,13728,Up to Vince of course but I'd say a caption would be gravy..sometimes even funnier than the pic itself.

662386,Roy,2012-02-01 02:16:00,13728,"Afraid not Mike. Interest brings it to the top. I'm sure it'll live long and flourish. It's a great thread and it was a great thread last year as well. Your participation and everyone elses for this season will bring it back next year. This, so far, has not been the best ice fishing year because of the weather but I'm sure that the next month and a half should bring us a few priceless photos."
662676,vinnimon,2012-02-02 01:35:00,2593,"  Muskie Mike, I am afraid not. As roy has mentioned there is little ice and once it it develops so will this thread. Last year was a blast and I am only doing this out of my own heart, a thank you to all OFC members. Also to keep winternet more interesting with a smile / many laughs here on OFC, last year was a blast.   Here is one I can add, but it doesnt count at all. The funny thing about this is the scent I put on my bait attracted the dog. A couple of drops ended up on the ice. "
