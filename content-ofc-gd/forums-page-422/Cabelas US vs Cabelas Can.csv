Secondly I'm getting 2 catalogues, one from the US, one from Winnipeg, I'm polite and try and get one canceled, save paper, call the US customer service, sorry can't help you, Canadian catalogue.  Okay, call Winnipeg, sorry you have to call the US, listen, been there done that, I guess I'll just throw another tree in the blue box. Unfortunately it seems Cabelas is getting worse as time goes by. Looks like they are trying to loose another faithful customer."

684015,Oggie,2012-04-05 19:50:00,588,Weird.  I've always had good service with Cabelas anywhere. I like the selection in the US and they ship USPS so I don't bend over for the man in Brown or his buddy Fed Ex.  I wish Cabelas Canada had some selection. Dan O.
