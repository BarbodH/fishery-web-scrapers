563655,Rod Caster,2011-03-20 13:44:00,5784,I was speaking to someone in a cafe and they told me they are looking (desperately) for junior engineers for a nickel smelting plant in Newfoundland. They are a large engineering firm and pay handsomely.... The mine manager called me and left me a contact number.  Starting pay is 140 000/yr. !  PM me and I can hook you up.
