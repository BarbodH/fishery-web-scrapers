563157,shimano25,2011-03-18 21:36:00,31,I was wondering if anyone here knows whether the Pond at Centennial Park in Etobicoke is permitted for fishing. I heard conflicting reports that it is a wildlife habitat and prohibited for fishing. Others have said that people are allowed to fish there. Does anyone know whether this pond is open or closed for fishing?
