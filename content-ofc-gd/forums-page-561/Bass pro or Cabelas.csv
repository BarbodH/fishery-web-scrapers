563825,kickingfrog,2011-03-20 21:29:00,8333,I thought there was one or the other near Pittsburgh???
563830,Billy Bob,2011-03-20 21:34:00,5865,"Only Cabela's in PA is in Hamburg, PA...nowhere near the Steel City...and no BPS near Pittsburgh either....closest would be Harrisburg, PA and that's a drive also...Sorry...  Bob"
563835,kickingfrog,2011-03-20 21:38:00,8333,I don't know why I thought there was one near there? Neither shore's websites show any stores in the area. I was wondering if a store had closed.
563836,Roy,2011-03-20 21:38:00,13728,I'd drive the extra 100 miles to go to Cabela's but that's just me. Just for a change.
563844,Rich Clemens,2011-03-20 21:50:00,3131,There is a to be a Cabelas in Wheeling WV I believe - not all that far from Pittsburgh.   Never been there - but it's in the area.
563851,solopaddler,2011-03-20 21:57:00,8605,"Hey Rob, if you go to Cabelas let me know.  I have a shopping list."
563878,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 23:09:00,4399, Can I add a few things to your list Mike?
563927,tomO,2011-03-21 01:31:00,363,yes there's a Cabelas in wheeling west virginia I 70 west out of Pittsburgh. bout and hour or so away.
563971,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 11:17:00,5865,"Last year while visiting the Harrisburg Sportsmen Show (weekend) we visited both BPS in Harrisburg and the HUGE Cabela's store in Hamburg, PA...my recommendation would be the Cabela's store hands down. Both were nice....the BPS store in Harrisburg is connected to a mall that was offering free bus shuttle rides to the Sportsmen Show 7 miles away because of parking restraints there. The next morning (Sunday) we arrived at the Hamburg,PA (40 miles)Cabela's store 20 minutes after it opened...already about 250-300 cars in their MASSIVE parking lots....It's 250,000 sq feet store which I believe is their largest of stores. It had 2 restaurants within the store....and NO TAX on any clothing....  When I visit my son Billy in Cortland, NY I drive right past the BPS store in Auburn, NY and often stop there....but that is a scaled down in size store (85,000 sq ft) compared to any other BPS or Cabela's I have ever been in....but still MUCH better then Expensive Mountain that we have here.
