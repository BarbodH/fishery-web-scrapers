Things only got better as the season went on and we ended up with a pretty good season.  Not quite as good as last season as far as numbers, but nothing to complain about, these things happen and we skunked just twice all season.  We fished the majority of our short-windowed perch season in 34-55 feet of water as I find the better fish are deeper, and it gives the opportunity to get some lakers/whities as well.  As for the lakers/whities, we caught them as shallow as 39 feet and as deep as 107, though the majority of our action throughout the season were in 78-82 feet.  Our best perch baits were tungsten spoons, teardrop/maggots, strike zone pan slammers and a small jigging rapala.  Our best laker/whitie baits were spoons, tubes, strike zone swammers and got some good fish on the laker taker as well.  Enjoy the pics, and as usual, if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  Cant wait to take a month and a bit off, steelhead a little bit and get back into the pike fishing!!!  Kelli with a good feed of perch  Mike shows the surprises that lurk the perch grounds...  Tough day for BUSTER, but we managed a few  Fat Laker!!!  Kept this one, and she had 16 smelt and 1 goby in the belly... talk about the ""feedbag""  A little bright... We release 90% of our fish, but a few times a season, theres nothing like fresh fish!!  Long whitie  I've had many questions about this spoon, it's a Michigan Stinger ""Dirty White Boy""  Lots of Solid fish swimming around out there...  I prefer laker fishing, but whities can be so reliable...  Quasimodo...  Solid fish for Cal  McKee with a nice laker  Chunky fish caught just 20 feet down  Client with a few nice ones!  Nice fish!!  Even though theres about 671000 in use at all times, the williams still puts fish on the ice...  A hefty reward courtesy of the Strike Zone Swammer  This was a beatdown!!  Kyle's PB Laker on the swammer again  Solid...  Chunker to end the season   Hope you enjoyed, cant wait for May 1 to be posting more reports!!"
