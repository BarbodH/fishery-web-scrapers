563945,BassMan11,2011-03-21 02:26:00,583,So i have finally put some  money aside for this spring and have decided to buy my first boat for the 2011 season. Just a little 14' with a trailer and a evinrude 9.9 for a very reasonable price. I am picking it up next week but am having a problem finding a place to put it because i live in an apt building and the property owners will not let me store it in the covered and locked parking lot. Just wondering if anyone knows a place close to Ottawa (nepean) area that has a reasonable price? Its only about 20' total with trailer and really dont want to pay an arm and a leg to park it somewhere fairly safe.  Any suggestions on what i should do? thanks  BassMan
