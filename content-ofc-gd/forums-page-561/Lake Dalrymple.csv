563302,Rattletrap2,2011-03-19 04:01:00,1652,"I also fished the lake every week-end for 21 years and still have a trailer there. My pattern for this year will be to try and follow Gord around the lake! I don't mind ""sloppy seconds""! LOL"
563316,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-19 11:46:00,4399, Hey Brian if you want to catch something you might want to follow someone who knows what they are doing I`m still trying to figure that lake out.
563642,Spiel,2011-03-20 12:55:00,9065,"I've heard that there's a few fish in there, I may have to head up and check it out this year.  It's been a while, right Brian."
563650,bigugli,2011-03-20 13:27:00,6138,"Usually get up 3-4 times a year.  Easy lake to figure out, really."
563757,Rattletrap2,2011-03-20 17:55:00,1652, Yes Chris...too long. Let's set a date and i will do all the work so you can rest your back! Deal?
563793,misfish,2011-03-20 19:37:00,29133,"Last time I fished Daly,it was during a BASS tourny. Buddy fished shallow,I threw tubes to the deep end. Guess who caught fish?  Great bass lake. Brian or lookinforwalleye , Im up for a day or two on the lake with yas.Just shoot a pm."
563887,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 23:47:00,4399,"  Hey Brian anytime,Brian and I have trailers in the same park it would be great to have a couple of Off`ners up for a fish, burger and a beer!!!"
563891,Rattletrap2,2011-03-20 23:53:00,1652,"  Yeah Gord, Lets make this happen this year. I have fished with Misfish in his boat, but never had the chance to return the favour. Layzee Acres was the first place I met Spiel as well, but we have never shared a boat together yet. For that matter, WE have not even fished together! LOL"
563893,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-21 00:00:00,4399,Sounds good we`ll leave the wife`s at home one weekend and have boys weekend!!!
