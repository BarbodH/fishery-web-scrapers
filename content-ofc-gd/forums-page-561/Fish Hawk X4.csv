563447,Grimace,2011-03-19 20:52:00,2020,I am a proud new owner of a Fish Hawk X4.  I have been eyeing this beauty up for a while and grabbed Radioworld's last unit at the show today.  Picked it up for 550 bones.  Pretty good deal.  The cheapest I saw them on the web was 630 plus shipping and handling.  I am pretty sure Radioworld will honour the price if you want one and go to the show.  I think they just call you when it comes in.  I think I heard him say that anyways.  Look out Salmon.  Anyone else have one?  How do you like it?
