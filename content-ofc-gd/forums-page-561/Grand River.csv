When I seen the Grand River I was surprised at how high it was I haven't seen it this high ever I know when the ice moves down river it backs up in Cayuga but this was insane. It looks like it will be awhile before the water level comes down. An all I caught at Lake Erie was something I have never caught there it was a Gizzard Shad about 13 or 13.5 inches I have a picture of it so I will post it when I get time to load the camera. In all my life growing up on Erie I have never caught a Gizzard Shad there. Has any one else caught any on Erie."

Gives a great indication on when the river is fishable once you have used it a few times. GRCA River Flows  "
