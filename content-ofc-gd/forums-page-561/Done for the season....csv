Still lotsa ice on the lake but access at the shoreline is getting real sketchy. My dog, Moosy, managed to find a soft spot as we were leaving the ice and went for an unexpected swim. It was only in two feet of water but enough to soak her from head to tail.  Overall, we had a decent season. Got into a lot more crappie this year, but a lot less perch.  Here's to hoping for an early ice-out...last year we were crappie fishing in the boat by April 1."
