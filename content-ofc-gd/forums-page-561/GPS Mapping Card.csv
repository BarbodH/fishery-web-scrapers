562749,Billy Bob,2011-03-17 19:12:00,5865,I have a 2008 Navionics Premium East Card that I use for most my areas and it was also good for Stoney Lake 2 years ago.....but now with a trip up to Cliffs on Sturgeon Lake this year I was hoping it would cover me there also...but guess what...the card stops at Pigeon Lake....  So my question is....does anyone have a card that covers Sturgeon Lake and what card is it ?  Bob
562755,Roy,2011-03-17 19:29:00,13728,What's the number on your card Bob?
562775,fisherboy,2011-03-17 20:30:00,48,My Navionics Great Lakes SD card covers Sturgeon Lake. I think the number is 14XG Gold+. I'm pretty sure that my HotMap Premium 08 also covers it...
562967,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 13:20:00,5865,"Roy, on the card it reads as follows:  HotMaps Premium East SD/PREM-E4 V01.20  SN000600553426"
562989,John,2011-03-18 14:22:00,2956,"Hi Bob,  I know that Cliff bought a new Lowrance unit for his Princecraft last year. I am sure he has the right card for Sturgeon. Knowing Cliff I am sure he will work something out for you."
563039,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 16:48:00,5865,"After pulling the EAST card out for the numbers that Roy requested I was going to put in a card that covers the French River but this card doesn't have depths, etc......LOW and BEHOLD I found the CANADA HotSpots Premium card purchased about 3 years ago and it in deed covers all the Kawarthans including Sturgeon Lake...DUH !  !  !"
563051,John,2011-03-18 17:07:00,2956,Good stuff Bob! Now you only have how long to wait...?
563119,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 20:19:00,5865,That's if I don't forget to go.....
563130,Big Cliff,2011-03-18 20:55:00,6899,"You don't need a card for Sturgeon Lake, we just sit on the dock and catch fish"
563134,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 21:01:00,5865,Sounds like my kind of fishing....and I'll bring the beer....errrr bait...
563181,John,2011-03-18 22:33:00,2956,Can you rent me a spot on the dock next to Bob for a few days......
563208,bassfanatic25,2011-03-18 23:27:00,36,"I have got the latest Navionics Hotmaps Canada card(MSD/HM-C).  It does have Sturgeon Lake and it is in HD, which means more contour lines and detail compared to the older Hotmaps Premium cards."
563210,Billy Bob,2011-03-18 23:31:00,5865," Problem is my ""old"" LMS 520c unit will not compute anything above a Premium card."
563420,bassfanatic25,2011-03-19 19:10:00,36,The most recent Hotmaps Canada card will indeed work on your LMS-520.  I know a few friends that run that card on that exact unit!
563472,Billy Bob,2011-03-19 22:00:00,5865, Yes and NO......Hotmaps and Hotmaps Premium will work in the LMS 520c but NOT Hotmaps Platinum as per Navionics own website....http://www.navionics.com/MarineCompatiblePlotters_PlatinumPlus.asp?GuideType=1  So be careful what you buy....taking the map cards can be almost impossible to take back once opened.  Bob
