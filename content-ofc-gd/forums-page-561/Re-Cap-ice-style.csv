I've seen more ling this year than ever, which is cool because I made a point of keeping some for table fare....it's always nice to target low-pressure species; poor man's lobster anyone?  Lakers are now on my mind... I'll give it a few more shots if the ice holds up, but my streak of 0 for at least 25 for lakers is both punishing and embarassing. Some people say practice makes perfect, but I'm beginning to have more confidence in blind luck    Early feed of perch    Night fishing for ling    First 5-ish pounder of the season-24 inches    Can you guess who this is, it's not the Jackalope.    Pike bait    Big ling of the season    Table fare!    Jim Jigger with a laker from Temagami    Big girl...down the hole she went    More taster samples.    Big perch of the season    nosobonsing beauty    Another big ling    I'll leave you with a pretty sight  "

563269,Nipfisher,2011-03-19 01:58:00,2449,Good job buddy. If you want to go one morning this week (Thurs or Fri) for lakers I'll guarantee you one. I know a lake where they are slaying them right now. Close to town and just a little sled ride.
