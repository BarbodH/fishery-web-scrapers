563966,lew,2011-03-21 10:43:00,12766,Calander says it's sposed to be springtime but somebody didn't get the memo cause it's snowing like crazy here with about 1/2 an inch in the last 30 minutes and no let-up in sight
563969,Spiel,2011-03-21 11:00:00,9065,"LOL.....It may be spring according to the calendar Lew but we're still in ""The Great White North.""  I've been out on the trout opener at the end of April and had snow falling on me."
563972,lew,2011-03-21 11:19:00,12766,Sad but true Chris and I can recall fishing Quinte in May one year when we had snow flurries.  The Great White North indeed
563975,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-21 11:27:00,35,"I remember a may 24 weekend in Huntsville where we had 1/2"" of sleet in the boat lol. And dont even mention fall muskie fishing in ottawa"
563976,Garnet,2011-03-21 11:37:00,2056,When I was about 17 we had a 4 day blizzard on April 10. We still had to get from Columbus to Port Perry to feed horses.
563979,OhioFisherman,2011-03-21 11:45:00,6623,"Spring? Even here it doesn`t happen until sometime in late April or Early May. The snow is off the ground here, but it doesn`t mean it won`t be back.  Muskie season is open though."
563984,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-21 12:21:00,1622,"We use to Camp out for Trout opener & we woke up a few times to snow on the ground, young & foolish, I'm thinking I'm too old for that to be fun now SBK"
563986,perchslayer666,2011-03-21 12:42:00,280,It will snow again. Mark my words.
563987,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 12:44:00,5865,It's 45 degrees here this morning....I think it was Thursday we had 65 degrees and lots of sunshine......the wife and I sat on the back deck drinking beer and toking on a stogie.....  Hoping 7-10 days to be crappie fishing on Chautauqua Lake...
563993,Headhunter,2011-03-21 13:08:00,5703,Sounds like a good time BB! HH
564008,Joey,2011-03-21 14:04:00,9122,"Yes Lew, Canada tends to like throwing in those snow days in Spring.  Heck you're not even safe in May sometimes"
564012,TDunn,2011-03-21 14:20:00,680,May long = snow up here... not always but every 2-3 years tho!  Now I have to go shovel my driveway
564017,bigbuck,2011-03-21 14:48:00,2449,It's 4deg in Oakville and raining. Gray miserable day. Thankfully I'm sitting at my desk working away and don't have to be out on the road today.
564044,John,2011-03-21 15:23:00,2956,When I was a kid we used to walk barefoot to school in the snow..........uphill both ways!
564059,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 15:52:00,5865,It's officially Spring here.....I just seen a nice juicy nightcrawler on my driveway from the rain.
564079,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-21 17:01:00,10439,It's sping up in the far North.    :thumbsup_anim: I can tell because my retina's are sunburnt!!!!  
564081,Whopper,2011-03-21 17:01:00,2174,  I believe this was May 14th 2009 waiting out a snow storm in Balmertown to fly into Little Vermilion  The day after  One of the best catching trips ever
564095,jimmer,2011-03-21 17:32:00,2730,"Everyone gets a spring in their step around this time of the year, when a few warm ones tease us. I remember a few years back hooking up the boat and heading up to a buddies for opening trout in the Bancroft area. We got there on the Friday night and slept in a Volkswagon Westvalia, woke up to snow on the ground and thought we would wait it out. Well, the snow didn't stop until there was about 6"" on the road.  We decided to pack up and head home, but probably should have stayed.  It was the worst white knuckle drive I ever had, trying to tow the boat with a Cutlass on unplowed roads, while my buddy followed in his Westvalia.  We were both all over the roads until we hit the Apsley area and things had turned to rain. This Canadian weather gets you when you least expect it! That's what makes this a great country :-)"
564132,bigugli,2011-03-21 18:43:00,6138,"It is still March, and we have not had the annual March nasty yet. You know, the heavy, wet sloppy snowstorm that usually lasts 1-2 solid days. March has been a lamb so far."
564149,Beans,2011-03-21 19:20:00,3339,"I white-knuckled it down to Peterboro this morning at 08:30 am and most rivers and creeks were open and flowing but Pigeon, Buckhorn and Upper Chemong  lakes were ice bound...doubt we will be boating on April 01 like last year..."
