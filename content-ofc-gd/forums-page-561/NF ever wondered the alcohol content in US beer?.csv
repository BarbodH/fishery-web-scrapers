563585,chris.brock,2011-03-20 02:58:00,4053,"I have always wondered the % of alcohol in US beer since they don't post it on the can/ bottle. I was at a restaurant where the menu stated the alcohol content. Everything was over 4%. Even stuff like Bud Lite, and 55 calorie beer was 4.2 and 4.4. I found this interesting, I always wondered if that stuff was 2% alcohol.  cheers"
563600,chris.brock,2011-03-20 03:33:00,4053,"for $15 a case it can be near water, it's cheaper than water up here"
563611,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 04:37:00,4399,There`s alcohol in American beer! Who knew!
563614,Jonny,2011-03-20 04:49:00,1380,American beer could be 2% and it would still be cheaper than ours for getting a buzz on.
563660,aplumma,2011-03-20 14:03:00,6896,Yup the beer is 2% if you add to much alcohol it spoils the taste of the beer.   Art

563667,kickingfrog,2011-03-20 14:28:00,8333,My understanding was that the percent alcohol was measured differently. As to the quality???
563684,Gregoire,2011-03-20 15:13:00,1397,I believe bud is considered a high alcohol beer in the states.
563707,Fisherman,2011-03-20 16:25:00,7201,"And now we know why 'merican beer's cheaper, you have to drink so much more of it, they have to keep the price down. Otherwise there's be too many Billy Bobs not getting into trouble and nothing for the Leos to do."
563738,Pigeontroller,2011-03-20 17:17:00,2793,"Yup, its scientifically proven that 'rednecks' like Billybob can't hold their liquor, if the US breweries but any more than 4% in the beer there'd be more rednecks in the streets shoot'n their doublebarrel shotguns than the police could handle!"
563777,fish_fishburn,2011-03-20 18:40:00,1311,they dont know how to make good beer....that goes for whisky as well. just saying.
563821,Billy Bob,2011-03-20 21:21:00,5865, Don't know about all the Redneck Billy Bob's but this one is a 35+ year volunteer firefighter and we are required to keg up when the call comes in...  Remember....Budwieser is the KING of BEERS...  
563823,mercman,2011-03-20 21:26:00,7054,yer a GOOD Billy Bob.....Billy Bob!!!! And dats da troot  Love the shrine....is it in your living room
563829,Billy Bob,2011-03-20 21:30:00,5865, Hell no.....it's in every fire hall down here...
563833,mercman,2011-03-20 21:37:00,7054," Good ole Red, White a Brew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
563954,adempsey,2011-03-21 02:58:00,1498,I am pretty sure there are A LOT more brands of beer in the USA than in Canada.  Most of the smaller breweries make some great beer.  It's not just all Bud and Schlitz.
563958,John Bacon,2011-03-21 03:57:00,3277," Yes, Americans measure their alcohol content by weight while we measure it by volume.  They will get a lower figure (alcohol is lighter than water) for the same amount of alcohol.  I can't answer about quality either ;-)"
563968,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 11:00:00,5865, Actually the #1 beer sold in WNY is Labatts Blue Light...so much that Labatts has moved their corporate HQ here in Buffalo.
563978,Garnet,2011-03-21 11:42:00,2056,I went to Vegas to find out I like Millar Lite.......could have been those girls standing on the bar..........na I like Millar Lite and girls standing on the bar.
563983,Pigeontroller,2011-03-21 12:19:00,2793,Rolling Rock...
563985,dave524,2011-03-21 12:30:00,4508,On the other side of the coin they have many overproof rums and vodkas where we are limited to 40% alcohol.
563992,Spiel,2011-03-21 13:03:00,9065," My neighbour brings Rolling Rock back for me every now and then, good stuff."
