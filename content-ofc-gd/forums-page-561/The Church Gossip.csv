Several members did not approve of her extra-curricular activities, but feared her enough to maintain their silence.  She made a mistake, however, when she accused Frank, a new member, of being an alcoholic after she saw his old pickup parked in front of the town's only bar one afternoon.  She emphatically told Frank (and several others) that every one seeing it there would know what he was doing!  Frank, a man of few words, stared at her for a moment and just turned and walked away.  He didn't explain, defend, or deny. He said nothing..  Later that evening, Frank quietly parked his pickup in front of Mildred's house .... walked home .... and left it there all night."
