I have a couple of quick questions for you fishing gurus about fishing in the states/Cali..  Firstly, has anyone fished the coast of Long beach? I am headed there for a conference in two weeks and am very very tempted to take a rod and reel and some top water poppers with me. However i have not had much time to research about the fishing down there as well as any regs and license info...I was wondering if any of you know of any such information.  For those who have had a chance to cast from the shores of longbeach.. is it worth it to take a rod down for possibly an evening of fishing...  Any info would be greatly appreciated!  Cheers, Nigel"
563402,Twocoda,2011-03-19 18:13:00,4130,Ive fished Point Loma and San Diego....if your limited to just one or two trips to the water for fishing ...then i would suggest just jumping on a charter....and heading out for some sea bass and such....they are fun and really good eating ...last charter i took out was only 25 bucks per person...and a very enjoyable experience...if you do take a rod ...youll be into the extra expence of a non resident fishing licence ....but if you hook into a Maco itll be worth the price of admission ...  Good Luck and dont forget your camera...   Cheers
