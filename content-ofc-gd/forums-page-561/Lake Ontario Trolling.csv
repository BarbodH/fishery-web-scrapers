563645,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 13:08:00,3761,Thanks again for the reply's everybody! Sure was fun out there and the weather held up nice for us. Looks like a little rain early week and things should be warm and sunny for next week   Finger's crossed!!
563647,ehg,2011-03-20 13:19:00,2666,"Nice very chrome like  brown there. I have a feeling i now where you were at. If you could get there right at first light in the morning it could be intense fishing. You really have to pay attention to the winds, north and light is the safest. Stay really close to shore at all times. Good Luck and be careful!"
563673,glen,2011-03-20 14:46:00,2641,Great post.  Open water people.
563692,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 15:33:00,3761," It was just after 11am maybe when we got onto the right stretch, after that we mad multiple pass's and didn't get a bite. Earlier is the key I think."

563453,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-19 21:23:00,3761,"Hey Guys, well my buddy Gone Fishin caught the bug and decided to put his boat and motor together last night so we could get out today for some fishing on Lake Ontario...It was awesome, we bundled up and had little trouble launching out boat, lot's of ice but we had maybe 6 feet on either side of the boat from shore to ice. Once out of the bay we got out on Lake Ontario and slow trolled Rapala hard baits behind the boat, both stickbaits and jointed ones. Didn't take long on the right stretch before I got the first and only fish for out outing but was well worth it. Here is my first brown and not my last, going to be doing this lot's more haha, was soo much fun.  Only had my frog rod but did it ever put it to work  Here's my PB and wicked fish    Till next weekend's report comes  MTBF"
563454,Grimace,2011-03-19 21:25:00,2020,That is a beauty.  Well done!!
563455,kickingfrog,2011-03-19 21:30:00,8333,Nice fish!
563459,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-19 21:32:00,3761,"Also, forgot to add the fish was from a hatchery, had the adipose clipped on it."
563460,irishfield,2011-03-19 21:33:00,26272,Nice fish Mike.. now do up the darn life jacket!
563463,Joey,2011-03-19 21:38:00,9122,Awesome
563464,GBW,2011-03-19 21:40:00,8460,nice fish!
563466,Joeytier,2011-03-19 21:43:00,3990,Nice brownie.  Don't usually see too many naturals out there.
563468,TDunn,2011-03-19 21:47:00,680,Great fish Mike!
563470,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-19 21:58:00,3761,"Thanks for the prop's guys. The life jacket I thought was buttoned up all day, the excitement made it open up haha...Na we play it safe while out there"
563471,bpsbassman,2011-03-19 21:59:00,941,Gotta get my boat out of storage!!!
563473,esoxansteel,2011-03-19 22:05:00,1307,"When are your going to change your name, on your avitar, the initials can still same the same now how about that and you can fish them all year long to boot  "
563502,spincast,2011-03-19 23:48:00,3279,nice fish!  gonna try hunting a few of those down myself in the nesxt couple weekends.
563504,Cudz,2011-03-19 23:51:00,2652,nice fish!  Time to invest in a survival suit if you are going to make a habit out of going out this time of year.
563542,dave524,2011-03-20 01:32:00,4508,"Very nice brownie  a little longer and leaner than most and a nice broad tail, nice change genetically from the football strain."
563546,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-20 01:35:00,3761," Ya I definitely wan't one man, I'll make due for the next little while but once work for me start's up I'll be grabbing one...after all the fall will be very long and full of trolling I hope!  As for the comment on the fish, this fish was great looking with a full belly still on it...Can't wait to get into some more of these fish as the trips pass by."
563556,camillj,2011-03-20 02:00:00,1988,Nice .. looks like an Atlantic to me
563559,fishnsled,2011-03-20 02:04:00,3520," Dang, beat me to it. Nice fish Mike, be safe."
563568,ctranter,2011-03-20 02:26:00,543,"Nice fish Mike.  Definetly looks like an Atlantic, but I'm sure the experts on here can make the call.  With all of the trib action these days I love the occasional big lake report.  Keep em comin!"
563577,camillj,2011-03-20 02:42:00,1988,Actually I was only joking .. it could be an Atlantic .. but in that colour phase you really need to be counting pyloric cecae to know for sure ... and by then a live release is kinda out of the question
563604,Ricky Bobby,2011-03-20 03:46:00,35,brown - square tail and wrong markings and head for atlantic. Nice brownie - were you off St Cath Jordan or Niagara R?
563617,BillM,2011-03-20 04:52:00,17367,"Look at the square tail on that bad boy, that's 100% brownie..  Way to many spots to be an Atlantic anyhow.  Good job Mike!"
563635,dave524,2011-03-20 11:32:00,4508,"I like to look at the position of the jaw in relation to the eye, the difference is much the same as large and smallmouth bass. With Browns having a eye-jaw relationship much like a largemouth and Atlantics are the smallmouth."
563636,spinnerbaitking,2011-03-20 11:39:00,1622,"Nice way to start the year off, keep them coming SBK"
563638,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-20 11:47:00,2050,Nice fish buddy!  Very jealous!
