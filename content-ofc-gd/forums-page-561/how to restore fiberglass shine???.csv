562903,shurik_muff,2011-03-18 03:15:00,35,"hello guys. i have a black fiberglass ""bass fishing boat"" that lost its shine. i do not have financial flexibility to just give the boat to specialist and pick up a good looking candy. decided to do it myself. i been reading on internet about some ways to restore the colour, but there are million ways and products. most of them are in the states. i live in toronto. to me, it seems like ""vivilon"" have beter looking results. it could be the case, or they really know how to show of their stuff. some sites recomend clear gel, some clear coat. from my understanding, gel is a temporary fix (up to a year). clear coat might be good for longer. as i will keep my boat for longer, i would prefer to apply the beter finish. i have spray gun/compresor if spraying required.  if anyone have some tips, an idea what is beter to buy, and maybe even some address it would be great.  thanks alot  "
562914,HTHM,2011-03-18 03:43:00,4082,"Do not spray anything on it! You can do a labour intensive, but very effective procedure called wet-sanding. For very detailed instructions send me a PM and I will send you a link to another board that has a very active restoration forum."
562936,bubbles,2011-03-18 11:32:00,591,"Wow, how bad is it?  Too far gone for some rubbing compound/wax?"
562941,shurik_muff,2011-03-18 12:06:00,35,"basically, the boat is black with golden/silver spots. when i wash it, it darkens for a a bit (a few minutes). on the sun, it looks flat/mate, with little to no shine at all. visually, from little knowledge i have, i dont think waxing would help. i have a story behind the boat. me and a best friend of mine bought the boat end of august last year. we had a nissan 60hp motor on enother boat, that had zero problems. we kind of upgraded.... this boat had a 90hp nissan, fishwell, beter trolling motor. to make the story short, motor was gone. didnt have compresion, didnt pull the hull. so we had to rebuild it. changed all 3 cilinders, and bantch of other stuff:). worst part is that we lost our fishing fall season. now when the motor is like new, i would like to spend a day to bring its look back. i dont think wet sanding is necessary, but after reading, it might be the best way to go. just more time consuming. what i notice on the body, some spots have ""original"" or might be not, clear coat pealed off. i guess there is a gel i need to apply to fill it up? is wet sanding will remove clear coat all together? anyways, thanks for repplies."
562944,Roy,2011-03-18 12:16:00,13728,"You know, a few pictures would really help with this assessment."
562945,dannyboy,2011-03-18 12:16:00,367,"If you haven't already give it a good cleaning to get the water scum off, this will let you see how bad the oxidization is. Get a decent polishing compound 3M has marine specific systems, Meguiars is another source. Start with a compound you can use by hand and be careful if you need to use a powered buffer as it can quickly burn through the top coat. Check out Youtube as it has many videos on using polishing compounds.  If the clear coat has peeled you will need to repaint, you can't sand a base coat without changing the colour.  Wet sanding is a fairly drastic way of removing damaged paint and is best left to someone with experience.  Dan"
562950,aniceguy,2011-03-18 12:32:00,1094,"agree on the wet sanding, if you want to try and do this, post a pic to see how bad it really is but starting with say an 800g wet to a 1500 wet should clean most of the haze up, then forget the cheap buffers go get a high speed buffer and use the products the last guy said, make sure you understand EVERY process you can do it your self but at the same time you can destroy it too"
562976,bigbuck,2011-03-18 13:47:00,2449,"Use some rubbing compound. I found the 3M works well when I took the haze off of my boat last fall. Get the rubbing compound with no wax, go over it good with clean rags and then use wax. Where there is no clear coat left, I'm afraid it will have to be redone. Check out iboats.com. There are discussion boards that might be able to help you out."
563205,IndySKS,2011-03-18 23:19:00,134,Read this link it might help also  http://www.bbcboards.net/zerothread?id=311487
563206,shurik_muff,2011-03-18 23:19:00,35,"thanks for replies. i made a few pictures. the more i looked at the boat, i star noticing that the bottom of the haul still has noticable shine. i would love to make it all look at least close to it. also when i vipe the fiberglass with water, it apears shiny for a bit, then when dries, loosing it. with poor knowledge and a bit of common sence, i believe waxing may do the trick. problem is i bettter ask before making it worse than it is. please look at few pics i made, and tell me what you think.... thanks   "
563232,dhickey,2011-03-19 00:47:00,1038,you might want to try going to Nohas. i have had great results.  they helped repair my small fiberglass/great results! their down buy kipling @ six points/reasonable prices and rock solid advice! i see your boat is still on the trailer/take it down and see what they think? just a thought.
563268,HTHM,2011-03-19 01:56:00,4082,"That is a very good example of oxidized gelcote. The finish can be restored by wet sanding IMHO. You just got to get sanding. It will be a heck of a job, but nothin good comes easy."
563282,BUSTER,2011-03-19 02:25:00,1336,"Quick wet sand with  800 then 1000, finish with buffer and polish. done, Blow your mind how easy it is."
563318,IndySKS,2011-03-19 11:54:00,134," Thats what it looks like to me too, I did my boat cap last spring and it took about 40 hours from start to finish or me piddling around in the evenings. i wet sanded with 1500 grit. It's not perfect but i was afraid of going too far. I went from something that was driving me crazy not being able to make it shine to receiving comments of wow nice shinny boat. PM me if you want any more info on how i did mine."
563334,BUSTER,2011-03-19 13:31:00,1336,"I'll add pics in a minute, mine was 10 times worse than your boat, mine was very rough to the touch now is smooth as a waxed buick. I used 3M Perfect It Rubbing Compound # 05973 and 3M Final Glaze # 06066 and then gel coat polish to seal it. After wet sanding."
563348,BUSTER,2011-03-19 14:32:00,1336,"This was a test spot when I first started, right is done once really quick then buffed and the left side of pic was sun beaten rough to the touch, felt like sandpaper. "
563353,shurik_muff,2011-03-19 14:52:00,35," can you please tell me where can i purchase 3m products. i searched the net, came across this products as well. the only thing i am not a big fan of ordering online. if anyone knows store or a supplier in toronto, please let me know. thnks"
563377,BUSTER,2011-03-19 16:34:00,1336,"I bought it at the Auto body supply shop(Guelph), Maybe ask a local body shop who they order their products from in your area. get some 800,1000,1200 wet paper buy it at CTC or home hardware,I ran down to sears and picked up a craftsman buffer,then bought the buffer pads at body shop."
563380,BUSTER,2011-03-19 16:37:00,1336,Oh I remember watching 3M videos on you tube.
563557,shurik_muff,2011-03-20 02:00:00,35,"ok guys, thanks for advices and tips. couldnt get the 3M product no were. one of my bodies is working for honda dealer, and does paint work for them. they are usung the 3M stuff, but i would not be able to get the compaunds earlier than month or so. i have found a product called ""buff magic"" and ""pro polish"" by SHURHOLD. for both compounds paid about 50 bucks. i did a sample on the boat, and couldnt believe my eyes. basically in a few minutes area became like new. for a moment i was more excited than going for muskie opening. i was trying to avoid wet sanding as many recomended, just because i had no clue how to do it corectly, and had no desire to spend few days for restoration. i will try to finish tomorrow and will post pics. hopfully it will help some one as well before season starts."
563640,bigbuck,2011-03-20 12:48:00,2449,"Canadian Tire sells the 3M rubbing compound and it sells the 3M wax in the boating section. Every store I've been to has it in stock. It'll cost you around $40 for the compound and the wax. It's there, take a look, otherwise ask an associate for help."
