564243,dhickey,2011-03-21 23:07:00,1038,i agree. but they should take a good look at what prompts these guys to do things like this. a good hit is a good hit but i certainly dont remember not knowing the differance between hitting some one or trying to hurt them so bad that they cant play /or make a living .  i love the game /  just dont agree where its going.
563889,chessy,2011-03-20 23:51:00,610,this guy should be gone for the rest of the season or year .. he is out of control   
563892,brifishrgy,2011-03-20 23:57:00,559,Charas hit was way worse but this elbow will definitely get Cooke at least a few games
563897,Joeytier,2011-03-21 00:11:00,3990,"I'd be surprised if he didn't get the rest of the season, at least.  One of the worst repeat-offenders in the league right now."
563898,Grimace,2011-03-21 00:12:00,2020,Cooke is garbage.
563900,GBW,2011-03-21 00:19:00,8460,"Mario as owner needs to put a ""stop paymet"" on Cooke's $ and fire him."
563921,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-21 01:16:00,0," considering the self righteous rant he went weeks ago, he should do something!"
563929,Pikeslayer,2011-03-21 01:33:00,1443,This guy is a piece of trash. He needs to be banned from professional hockey. Maybe they can get rid of grapes too
563931,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-21 01:35:00,0, amen brother.
563933,GBW,2011-03-21 01:37:00,8460,full out!  stand up and FIRE the goon!  how does that affect the cap?
563935,muskymatt,2011-03-21 01:58:00,2608," What?????  Are you kidding, Chara's hit was only bad because of bad rink design. Cookes hit was a deliberate elbow to the head, premeditated, intentional, and a complete example of goon hockey.  Comments like yours are whats going to have hitting banned from hockey.  "
563936,Pikeslayer,2011-03-21 01:59:00,1443,"Time for the league to ""fish, or cut bait""."
563937,Grimace,2011-03-21 02:02:00,2020,I didn't like the Chara hit but you can not compare them.  Cooke is a coward and a thug.  With the NHL's lack of suspensions and the new mandatory 15 minute break for someone with a head hit you can look forward to more of this.  Bettman is a parasite to our sport.
563942,brifishrgy,2011-03-21 02:17:00,559,"  Charas hit was just as deliberate, premeditated and intentional, if you don't believe it watch it again.. he sees the stanchion coming and deliberately pushes his head into it  Chara got away with his hit because they could blame the rink design  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zq7b6QhVdA  I am not defending Cooke at all .. he deserves a suspension but so did Chara and the NHL dropped the puck on that one too so don't be surprised if they drop it again and again and again"
563952,muskymatt,2011-03-21 02:53:00,2608, Habs fan no doubt!   That said I'm not getting into that debate again  .....good luck with it.
563988,tb4me,2011-03-21 12:44:00,3295,lol here we go again....
563991,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-21 12:58:00,4399,"Not getting dragged into it this time,I`ll get my revenge when the Habs beat Chara and his band of bullies in the playoffs"
564033,brifishrgy,2011-03-21 15:10:00,559,  worse then a Habs fan ... I'm a leaf fan
564189,blaque,2011-03-21 21:07:00,2419,"Ya this cooke hit is unquestionable though. Theres no.....hmmm let me look at it 20 times to decide. He shows full intent. This guys missing some brain cells.  I dont care if the intent is there or not to be honest. If you unintentionally high stick a guy, you get two minutes in the box. Ya get punished. If he bleeds, from the high stick, again.........intentional or not, you get a stiffer punishment. More time in the box. Why, because the injury was worse. Personally i think chara should have gotten hit with something, and it should have been stiff because of the severity of the injury.  At least it was more of a hockey play than coming across the width of the ice with your elbow crosshaired on a guys face"
564194,ADB,2011-03-21 21:19:00,444,Cooke's suspension: the rest of the season + 1st round of the playoffs.
564197,Rod Caster,2011-03-21 21:25:00,5784,"Agreed, brutal hit indeed.  I would not be proud to have him as an assistant captain. What a doofus."
564201,muskymatt,2011-03-21 21:32:00,2608,  Not enough imo....should have been the rest of this year plus playoffs and 25 games next year...
564204,ADB,2011-03-21 21:35:00,444," They could kick him out forever, for all I care.  He is not needed in the NHL at all."
564225,kickingfrog,2011-03-21 22:12:00,8333," Not long enough, but more then I thought he'd get."
564230,dhickey,2011-03-21 22:19:00,1038,yeh he deserves it./no cheques either.!
564235,kickingfrog,2011-03-21 22:35:00,8333,Players stop getting their salary during the play-offs. That's why I would have liked to see him miss a cheque or two next fall as well.
