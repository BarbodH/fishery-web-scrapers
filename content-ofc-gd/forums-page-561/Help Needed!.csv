564112,Pigeontroller,2011-03-21 18:06:00,2793,"Hey Everyone...I really need your advice on a serious problem:  I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs: if the phone rings and I answer, the caller hangs up; she goes  out with the girls a lot. I try to stay awake to look out for her when she comes home but I usually fall asleep.  Anyway last night about midnight I hid in the shed behind the boat. When she came home she got out of someone's car buttoning her blouse, then she took her panties out of her purse and slipped them on.  It was at that moment crouched behind the boat that I noticed a hairline crack in the outboard engine mounting bracket.  Is that something I can weld or do I need to replace it?   "

564122,Nipfisher,2011-03-21 18:28:00,2449,Divorce her...take half the money and buy a brand new boat package. More time for fishing. lmao that was a good one PT.
564126,daryl0815,2011-03-21 18:36:00,225,"  That is definitely a serious situation, I think that you should dig a little deeper and look closer into it, and maybe even hire a professional to investigate!  I would say that you should move on and get a new part(ner) that wont let you down.. sometimes things just cant be fixed!   "
564130,Billy Bob,2011-03-21 18:40:00,5865,Does He/She have a better boat that you borrow while the wifey keeps em occupied...  You have to look at the positive sides to everything...

564178,Big Cliff,2011-03-21 20:41:00,6899,"Fix the boat, keep the wife, she'll never complain about you wanting to go away on fishing trips and won't mind you spending a few bucks on fixing the boat or buying new gear."
