563597,chris.brock,2011-03-20 03:28:00,4053,"We did Parks Fly-In, went to Cam Lk/ Little Miss., we were happy with the trip but you get what you pay for, we paid $650 per guy, we had to spend a couple hours cleaning the cabin (1st goup of the year) of mouse crap, sealing window screens, and little odd jobs. Most of our gas cans had been punctured by bears and were empty. It seems to be bear city around those Chapleau Game Preserve outposts. On the whole, we were happy, we paid about 1/2 price to fish Little Miss., never met Martin but he sounded like a good guy. PM if you like  what did solopaddler have to say about the outfitter?"
