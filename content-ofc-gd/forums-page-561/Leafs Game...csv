563498,jedimaster,2011-03-19 23:34:00,3472,OMG LUKE SCHEN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
563501,ctranter,2011-03-19 23:48:00,543,Luke looked a little more like Braydon on that one.  Great goal for sure
563517,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 00:22:00,4399,"Nice close up of Lucic,nice scratch on the end of that thing he calls a nose must of got it caught in a door!!! Thats one damn ugly dude!!!"
563519,jedimaster,2011-03-20 00:29:00,3472,OMG It must be the Super Moon
563522,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 00:31:00,4399,go leafs go!!!  Bruins should start to goon it up any time now!
563531,ctranter,2011-03-20 00:48:00,543,"lol, Lookinforwalleye, I thought of you when the fans at the ACC boo'd Chara whenever he touched the puck.  Despite our oldschool rivalry, Leafs fans clearly have your back.  I don't know why or how the bruins failed to show up tonight but this game is very fun to watch from a leaf perspective.  As soon as Leaf playoff hopes are lost, the next best Canadian team becomes my focus.  Hopefully the first round matchup is Habs v Bruins that would be awesome."
563538,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 01:03:00,4399," All`s well, I made a packed with myself to not get to wound up about hockey threads anymore!!!  And yes a habs bruin series would be awesome,nothing better than beating bruins!!!"
563539,jedimaster,2011-03-20 01:08:00,3472,HABS SUCK!!!!                   haha just gettin yah goin....

563547,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 01:39:00,4399,Dion Dion!!!
563548,jedimaster,2011-03-20 01:42:00,3472,Haha chara took a good one for yah.

563578,chris.brock,2011-03-20 02:42:00,4053,"I watch alot of hockey, come playoff time, any team could win, Bruins and Flyers don't look as good as their records indicate  Milan Lucic won't score 25-30 goals ever again Thomas and Miller are good, but they can be beat players that need a whoop'in- Souban, Ovechkin and of course, Kaleta"
563582,tibbs,2011-03-20 02:52:00,650,I was just at the game. I had awesome seats.  It was a great game.
563610,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-20 04:33:00,4399," Ya P.K. is even getting on my nerves, good young hockey player but his antics are bush!!!"
563710,tb4me,2011-03-20 16:33:00,3295,"I thought that was a Great game. If wilson had of not put giggy in net VS florida we could have been tied for the 8th spot.The boys def play like a totally different team with Reimer in net. The leafs need a good old Canadian coach, not some second rate american bum. Go Leafs Go!!!"
