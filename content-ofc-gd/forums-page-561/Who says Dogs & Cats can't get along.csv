563808,Muskieman,2011-03-20 20:41:00,2472,"Rats.. that's about the size of 'em..  Tiny is awesome with the kids has a heart of gold and is as big as a St Bernard (in her little head anyways).. she hunts snakes, frogs and bugs..  Paris... well let me tell you ,If you don't know the breed.. Min Pins were the first bred vermin hunting breed .. ""King of the Toys"" She has yet to be caught or intimidated by any dog.. scares off bears, chases Squirrels, Hares and Partridge even brings them back (not the bears)...10 Lbs of pure muscle.. 4th fastest breed on the market.. she thinks she weighs  200lbs  and so do I sometimes...  As for Tiny .. we got her when we were in an apartment... we rescued Paris from an abusive family at 6mos old... Now that we have property and room for a bigger dog.. later this year we will be getting a large breed.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonberger  Randy "
