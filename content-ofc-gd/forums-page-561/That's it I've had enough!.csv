563761,Terry,2011-03-20 18:00:00,14456,picked up mine from winter storage today.........  the best sign that spring has sprung
563764,irishfield,2011-03-20 18:02:00,26272,I just walk by mine and rub it every day Dan... I've never got around to covering it since the last Muskie trip !!
563766,Fisherman,2011-03-20 18:06:00,7201," I can just see it now, Terry and Brain and Muskymatt standing beside your boat waiting for a little rub.."
563769,muskymatt,2011-03-20 18:15:00,2608," I'll have plenty of the hands on experience before the first launch of the season. As soon as I get it out of storage, I have to take the kicker off, rebuild the transom wood with marine ply and then take it in for the new etech 115 to be installed, then it's repair the carpet, install a new center console seat, all the electronics and then fishy time....  lots of work but it'll be like new so it's worth it..."
563796,John,2011-03-20 19:53:00,2956, That's just wrong................
563801,mercman,2011-03-20 20:18:00,7054,"Just uncovered my old one to get things out of it.Took out the MinnKota, and the seats.Brought the motor to Thomas Marine, the boat will go next week maybe. April 30, the new ride comes home, and i start getting her ready for the water."
563834,d_paluch,2011-03-20 21:37:00,343,Just finished building a floor for my inflatable. Carpeted and everything. Can't wait
563838,danbouck,2011-03-20 21:41:00,4380,"Turns out installing the new sonar/gps isn't a quick job   Just gotta get her all loaded back up and she's ready for the water, might hit Lake O next weekend."
563896,Rattletrap2,2011-03-21 00:08:00,1652,"  Wayne, I long for the day when i can keep mine indoors and give her a rub every now and then! LOL"
563904,HTHM,2011-03-21 00:35:00,4082,"Disregard the PM, I wanna come too...."
563914,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-21 01:02:00,1107,I don't have a boat my driveway looks naked  only 13 more days and I will be   the bays wide open and I know 1 launch that is clear for sure
563917,danbouck,2011-03-21 01:06:00,4380," If it happens, I'll let you know.   I won't be hitting the bay until then and all the channels should be clear in a couple weeks."
563946,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-21 02:31:00,2690,"I'm lucky that I can store mine at work for free, so, get to see it everyday...well every weekday...and, yes, she's coming out real soon!!!!!!"
563963,spincast,2011-03-21 09:33:00,3279,"  Aint that the truth!. 3 hours to remove the Garmin and put in the Lowrance on Saturday.  - BUT I did get out on Lake O sunday with Vinnimom and get a chance to check it out.  Couple hits, but nothin' to show for it other than a great feeling being on the water on a sunny day in March   - and a good chuckle over the seagull that took my Storm crank bait from 2 foot under the waters. Fortunately, with the help of the weight from the in line planer board we managed to shake it off without bringing it all the way to the boat. Bring on the sun and double digit temps......."
