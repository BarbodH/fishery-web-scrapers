I thought it was for the high test. NOPE  when I did get gas I found it in Dryden at $1.28 a litre.  looks like i'm gonna be running the 20 horse mercury on the little boat more than the 150 merc on my big boat (40 gallon capacity) this year."

You look at all the other prohibitive taxes on fuel in Ontario and it could get ugly for a little.  Ben Bernanke even went as far as to say that extended high oil and fuel prices could cause a reversal in the economic recovery and push us ""back"" to recession.  Maybe we should kick mcsquinty out this october"

This unrest in the Middle East has to end soon. If the price of fuel continues to rise, we will see the economy slow down and maybe the US will slip back into recession and that is the last thing they need right about now."
