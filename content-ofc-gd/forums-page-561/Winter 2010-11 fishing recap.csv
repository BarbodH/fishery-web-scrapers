Not a spectacular year by any means, but I did manage two PB's and a healthy amount of bent rods, so I can't complain.  My first hardwater trip this year was out on Quinte.  Got out a couple times in mid/late december for some chunky, early-ice eyes.  Managed 6 walters over 2 trips, with an impressive average size, including a monster 10 + pounder my friend landed.   A nice quinte snack   The majority of my January and February was spent out on Nipissing.  Fishing was typically fairly good, producing plenty of 10-14"" walleye, a few herring and excellent jumbo perch fishing.  My most productive perch and herring days were in 13-16 FOW and all of the walters came out of 28 + FOW.  Slightly worrying that I wasn't able to scrounge up at least a couple slot-sized walleye, but apparently others were finding them just fine.      One of the more interesting trips of the year was a trip up north to a small trout lake with a natural population of brookies.  I managed to land my first ever brookie through the ice, even though he was only a baby.  Still a beautiful fish.  We landed another one around 17"" that hit a tip-up right before dusk.    Also managed to make it down to Simcoe in early March to give the whities a try.  After hours of running and gunning in the morning we ended up hitting a nice school of whities in about 100 FOW.  Iced one, lost 2 more at the hole, and missed 2 more hits in about a 30 minute time span on a foxee.  Marked schools steady for the rest of the day, but they had a serious case of lockjaw.  Despite the insane wind, we perserveared and stuck it out for a few jumbos on the way in.   One of the more memorable trips this year was spent out in the boat chasing after brownies on the big lake.  Had two great days, landing 35 + brownies and two incidental walleyes, one of which being a personal best, or at least very close.  This little bullet was an average sized fish    Sayonara, winter...
