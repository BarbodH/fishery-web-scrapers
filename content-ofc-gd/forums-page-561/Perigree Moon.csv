563482,Twocoda,2011-03-19 22:52:00,4130,There are going to be some strange effects on the water levels this weekend due to the Perigree Moon...some waters are going to be high and some extremely low...  This Photo was taken saturday afternoon at the north side of Port Elgin Harbour on Lake Huron and these two boulders are normally underwater except about 12 inches of the top of each one...the boulders are roughly 4 feet high and i actually walked out to them ...its an oddity !!!!      The last time Perigree Moon was in 1993..
563483,Grimace,2011-03-19 23:01:00,2020,That is really cool.  The moon can really pull the water around.
563488,irishfield,2011-03-19 23:08:00,26272,Don't be so quick to think that's the moon... them rocks are gonna be real high out of the water this year regardless !
563489,Terry,2011-03-19 23:14:00,14456,I don't know I pulled a moon and the wife said the rocks were high     I don't know what that means but it seemed funny in my head
563492,Twocoda,2011-03-19 23:22:00,4130,I know what your saying Wayne...but all the years of looking out of this harbour i have never seen it this low that i could actually walk out to the rocks...here is another pic of a rock that is normally completely submerged...seems the seagulls have a new landing spot...the black rock on the right hand side is where the water levels normally are this time of year....i read Splashoppers thread on the water level of Lake Huron and thought i would check it out for myself...there is still two miles of ice on the Lake yet to thaw  
563493,irishfield,2011-03-19 23:25:00,26272,Yah.. but that thawing ice won't raise the water level.. only snow pack in the bush and spring rains can.
563499,Fisherman,2011-03-19 23:35:00,7201,"Just took a look at the Great Lakes water level charts, Huron is definitely down below last year and below the mean average.  Prop builders rejoice..pay attention to the hidden shoals."
563520,Joey,2011-03-20 00:29:00,9122,Moon is up and its a biggie
563565,camillj,2011-03-20 02:21:00,1988,Alright .. Alright .. I just went out with a Camus XO to admire the sooooooooo raaaaaaaaare occurence of the perigrine mooonie .... to be honest she was almost as bright as you could want ..... but not nearly as big as I expected ... oh wait .. that's what SHE said
563571,irishfield,2011-03-20 02:28:00,26272,So close I think I saw the American Flag fluttering in the none existent breeze...
563580,mercman,2011-03-20 02:47:00,7054,The moon is not the only thing thats high in retrospect you are right Jon.
563581,camillj,2011-03-20 02:49:00,1988,okey ... just a little toooo much information
563626,Twocoda,2011-03-20 06:40:00,4130,Heres the moon at 2 AM ...i shouldnt have had a nap today...now ill be up all night  
563627,KGuppy,2011-03-20 06:47:00,18,"you can see the water level on that rock, and yes the moon plays such a huge difference in tides and water levels..its amazing...i had a nap to, now im going to look at this giant moon."
