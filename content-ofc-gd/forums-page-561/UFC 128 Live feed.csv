563532,Marko,2011-03-20 00:51:00,854,not sure about the quality of the feed  http://www.firstrowsports.eu/watch/55319/1/watch-ufc-128:-shogun-vs-jones.html
563545,Governator,2011-03-20 01:35:00,879,"Great card tonight, looking forward to several fights.  I really hope Jones takes the belt, he's such a class act for a 23yr old and would make a great champ."
563563,msp,2011-03-20 02:08:00,1336,Thanks Marko. Works great for now.
563583,Handlebarz,2011-03-20 02:55:00,3790,freezing up here is there another link???
563587,Marko,2011-03-20 03:02:00,854,http://veetle.com/index.php/channel/view#4d823c61675dd  Try that one....how good is your internet connection? You need at least rogers high speed cable or equivalent to be able to stream most feeds these days
563612,ironstone74,2011-03-20 04:40:00,201,"Thanks for the link Marko!  Great card, Jones is amazing!!!  Paul"
563613,Governator,2011-03-20 04:47:00,879,"DOMINATION....  WOW  So much more than I had hoped for, Jones is the man."
563620,Handlebarz,2011-03-20 05:00:00,3790,I reloaded it and it worked fine.  Great fight Jones was killer I can not wait to see him again  Thanks for the reminder here of the fight it helped pass the night for putting together baits.
563648,ehg,2011-03-20 13:24:00,2666,"Yeah, the link worked. It is an european feed since the American ones were shut down.  Shogun looked terrible against Jones"
563652,Mark Kulik,2011-03-20 13:38:00,348,"So far everyone who's fought Jones has looked terrible against him, -his only loss was also a total domination of Matt Hamill a couple of illigal downward elbows caused a DQ , otherwise he would be undefeated , now one has been able to figuire him out -his superior wrestling, reach and power have been too much.  I believe he will be champ for a while, the fact that he's 23 and getting better is scary if your a light heavyweight in the UFC."
563658,Cudz,2011-03-20 14:02:00,2652,"True Mark Jones is such a well rounded and strong LH.  Last night I was trying to think of anyone who might be close and couldn't.  He has made everyone he has faught look terrible.  Ironically the fight he dominated the most was his fight with Hamill.  He made Matt look silly and ended up getting DQd (pretty much after Hamill couldn't even get up).  23, big, and strong, wonder how much longer he stays at LH?  Give him a couple years and see if he moves to HW"
563663,steverowbotham,2011-03-20 14:13:00,1800,"So many people are going off about how Shogun looked bad, the fact of the matter is that Jon Jones is an incredible fighter.  Watch his post-fight interview on www.mmafighting.com about him and his coach chasing down and catching a mugger in Jersey a few hours before his fight.. The kid is a superstar and will continue to dominate for years until the ""next generation"" of MMA stars come up.  Give him some time to put on some mass and he will be laying the same beatings in the heavyweight division."
563744,[emailÂ protected],2011-03-20 17:29:00,119,"as good as he is as a lightheavyweight, to consider him having any chance as a heavyweight is delusional IMO.  looked great last night, and Rua looked equally terrible"
