Just wifey & myself at home now, so 2 vacant bedrooms!  Oh, I have 2 beer fridges!!  Just in case you get thirsty after a day of hauling in 7,8 lb walleyes!  Perching is rather boring cuz they're only 13, & 14""!  LOL!  I just like to rub it in a bit.  Keep your rod tip up!  Sadly the smallies range from 4 - 6 lbs.  My PB smallie is only 5.5 lbs!"

992941,akaShag,2017-01-28 00:14:00,2073,"You need to fish backlakes like mainville, or a bunch of lakes Im not naming on here lol.  Go with locals knowledge and now lodges. I was SUPPOSED to fish with a guy from Emo, but then he had to work so I booked time at a lodge...........  and then that guy's work schedule got changed AGAIN and I could have been fishing with him!!!!  ""Work is the curse of the drinking class.""  Doug"
992942,manitoubass2,2017-01-28 00:15:00,11391,Its all just joking around at this point bud.  But the concensus seems to be the drive.
992944,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-28 00:40:00,8243,"Like brickeygetter said that drive is about the same as going to Florida. 7 hours shorter is Myrtle Beach and its ""all you can eat"" Calabash for less than 15 $ CDN, kids eat for free usually. Unless the entire family hunts and fishes one is more likely to drive south where everyone can enjoy it."
992955,wormdunker,2017-01-28 03:37:00,1711,"All good points guys!  We have monster walleye, bass, muskie & rainbows right in Erie no matter which side of the lake you fish on.  Oh did I mention we also have 15"" perch!  We are on the north shore of Erie near cities such as Fort Erie, Port Colborne, Port Maitland & Nanticoke.  On the south shore Erieau, Leamington & Colchester are all great walleye factories also rainbows & jumbo perch.  A bonus if you travel to Fort Frances you'll have a top notch guide with Manitoubass.  Buy a round or 2 of beers at the Emo Inn & you'll have a knowledgeable guide for the day.  1 snag however, is when travelling through the small town of Emo & Rick says turn right at the Shell station to get to his house -forget it!!  LOL!  There is no Shell station!  I'll leave it at that??"
992958,Ron,2017-01-28 03:45:00,1683,"I have a question for my fellow angles from southern Ont. Every fishing season we see hundreds of American anglers come into the area to enjoy the great fishing & beautiful scenery we have in the area. We see people from as far away as California,Texas,Arizona,Florida and all states in between,but very few from southern Ont. Is it the distance,cost or other factors?  With as many lakes as I have to fish in Southern ONT, I have trophy sized fish of each and every species in my back yard and plentiful at that. I don't have to drive more than 3 hours to fish them. It's not only NWO that has great populations of fish. Within 3 hrs of driving, I can catch: 16"" Crappie 15"" Perch 34"" Walleye 56"" Muskie 48"" Pike 50"" Long nose Gar 6lb Small mouth bass 5lb Large mouth bass 30lb Chinook Salmon 20lb Rainbow trout 30lb Lake Trout 15lb Brown Trout 28lb Carp  The only species I can not catch big locally is Brook trout in the open water. For that, I have to drive 4 1/2 hours. I don't get charged American funds to do this either."
992967,akaShag,2017-01-28 12:45:00,2073,back to Ron...............any hints as to where a person might find those first two?Doug
992969,pics,2017-01-28 14:29:00,1268,22 hours is a bit too much for me..  14 to jellico and you are in a great area to fish and hunt.. Not so much for moose anymore but lots of grouse.  The lakes have pressure but if you go off the beaten track you can find fly in quality fishing.  Our last moose trip cost less than $350 each for 13 days because we stay in a trailer in the bush.  We know of at least 4 groups from the Binbrook /Hamilton area who travel to the same places to hunt and fish.  We head into town every 4-5 days to get more food from the freezer or have a shower at a house one of the groups own...
992982,scuro2,2017-01-28 19:19:00,904,"Many southern lardarses won't go beyond the Sudbury Northbay line. Just too ""far"" a drive. I on the other hand won't look for a spot south of that line. I'm sure there are some great places but I'd rather be in the north proper. Americans on the other hand don't consider a drive too far until you hit the 24 hour mark.  I once came upon an American with three small children sitting at the side of the road, I thought I'd offer assistance. His children needed to be fed...he'd only driven 18 hrs and was disappointed with his time. They are so hardcore that way. I've got my eye set on the big lakes of the NW and that will happen with retirement where you have the time to drive and fish. It's a time thing...the NW really requires some time and that isn't always possible with work and family.In the past when I looked at flying, BC wasn't much more then Winnipeg and it's a little more exotic...or if you are flying to Winnipeg it's hard not to get tempted going into northern Manitoba."
992985,craigdritchie,2017-01-28 19:53:00,1586,"For me, northwest Ontario has good fishing for a lot of things, but it really doesn't have the best fishing for anything. By the time I look at travel costs to NW Ontario, the reality is that Saskatchewan or Manitoba isn't much more and both of those have far better fishing for pike, walleye and lakers.  For everything else, I find I catch bigger fish here in the south.  150 walleyed a day is fun, but when they're all the same cookie cutter 15 inch fish, it gets dull fast."
992988,manitoubass2,2017-01-28 20:11:00,11391,"LOTWs bro.  But thats totally fine. I now realize its much better the southerners stay south.  The rare few that do come, I look forward to meeting you and sharing some adventures!!!!  Hopefully Chris Brock will come one day. I know we'de have an epic adventure!  Wormdunker hurry up and make plans brotha!!! When ya visit this time, its time for some hardcore fishing!!!"
992999,kickingfrog,2017-01-29 02:26:00,8333,Northwestern Ontario really needs some of you to start writing their tourist adverts.
993000,manitoubass2,2017-01-29 02:36:00,11391,Lol. Its not serious Rob. Just ribbing.  Ontario is full of great fishing and we all know that.
993003,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-29 05:04:00,8243,"Doug aka Shag, I have caught a 18"" crappie and more than a few 14.75"" yellows here on Erie. I just can't get that 15"" perch though. Others have. When you get a big perch like that you would swear it was a Walleye at first glance. My pal we call The ""Crappy"" hunter lost it when I caught that Crappie. 1st time ever targeting them. Just after ice out around dock piers, no boat. There were still piles of snow in the marina parking lot. No way to get into that marina now, even with a boat it's all locked up. The marina does not own the water. It is totally illegal to put cables across the opening. I don't know if they have since removed them. If you PM me I will tell you where the crappie were then, the perch can be anywhere. It's hide and seek."
993004,ch312,2017-01-29 06:03:00,1590,"I love heading north and being on lakes where it seems you're the only soul on the lake, but those trips are few and far between when you throw the time and money (cost of trip + lost wages) into the equation. In the end, it's just not worth heading far north very often.  Erie alone can keep a fisherman happy with it's amazing fishery. After dozens of trips I have not caught a single walleye under 16"" with the average being 24-28"" and charters reporting 4-5 man limits of these 24""+ fish before noon is a regular occurrence. Then there's the perch where bringing home limits of jumbo's form the main lake is almost expected. Pike? My best outing was 20+ fish by 11am with many missed and lost fish. You can easily go all day on the tribs without seeing a single angler while targeting steelhead.  You can hit Ontario where trolling the shallows in the spring results in brown after fat slob brown smashing the cranks. Then it's salmon and rainbow time where catching a dozen or two before noon is common practice. Sore arms are to be expected while trolling this great lake.  Then there's the Grand River for the smallie and channel cat fans. Catching dozens of smallies up to 3-4lbs each outing is easily doable if you know where to go and the huge cats with good numbers will keep you coming back for more.    All within 1 hour of my house. Why spend hundreds of dollars a day to fish when I can spend $10-40?"

It has been a long time since I have fished, and even longer for intentionally fishing for Walleye on Lake Erie, but catching very small Walleye usually didn't happen, even when Perch fishing. 2-4 pounds was an average size and it could double that at times easily.  I think the smaller ones stay away from the bigger ones, some areas are known for producing 8# plus fish depending on the season. On Lake Erie the success of the spawn seems to be the main factor in maintaining a "" sustainable fishery ""."

I have got smaller pickeral in the evening trolling at a few near shore locations. The larger fish of the offshore fishery seem to be comprised of one maybe 2 age classes. Erie seems to have a really strong reproductive year every 3 years or so and those fish drive the fishery until the next strong age class comes along, not an ideal situation but seems to be working for the last 30 years."

It seems many smaller fish are caught in the west end while here in the central basin they're mostly the big fish migrating west to east. I've caught maybe 5 fish under 20"" while trolling in the 45-60' range with the biggest being 32"". I prefer the smaller fish for eating and as odd as it may sound, it's sometimes disappointing bringing in big fish after big fish. Erie is a trophy walleye factory."

After your arms are sore we'll head back in to shallower water and have some fun with the perch, pike and smallies. Maybe even head over to Lake O for some trout and salmon. It makes for an awesome day hitting one lake for the morning and the other for the afternoon.  Then you'd realize why many people from the southern end of the province don't feel the need to head north to fish...."
993326,scuro2,2017-02-03 05:24:00,904,Yeah...but I'm from the south and when you fish the big lakes and a lot of the other water on the south end of the province it only reminds you of what nature should be like. The water is never as it should be...these waters have become an environment that has adapted to mankind.  There still is a thrill to be on a lake where the influence of man is next to nil.
993327,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 06:10:00,11391,"Exactly!  There is some hypocrisy going on on this board.

I can't recall how many times I have launched or loaded up without a soul in sight. Heck, it's a bit unnerving heading out on Erie some days as you're the only boat on the water for miles. As for problems with waterfront owners and blown out spots, 9 times out of 10 that's a direct result of the person complaining about it bringing it upon themselves.   Obviously the landscape is much nicer in Northern Ontario, there is no disputing that. However, don't bet the farm that fishing is better up there"
993329,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 08:42:00,11391,Fishing is good everywhere lol
992847,wormdunker,2017-01-27 07:23:00,1711,"I have to agree with most of the guys stating their opinions of great fishing to be had with a 6 ,7 or 8 hour drive of the GTA.  Areas north of Sudbury, Folyet & Chapleau have some outstanding fishing opportunities, for many different species, so why spend 2 days to fish Lake of the Woods??  I was fortunate to be in the area working anyway so why not include a trip to one of the best fishing areas in the world?  A quick breakdown of my expenses to get to Rainy River. Travel time 22 hours from St. Catharines Gas expense for one way trip $325.00 Hotel in White River $95.00 Dinner the first night $45.00 Breakfast next morning $15.00 Arrive in Rainy River late the 2 nd day So $480.00 X 2 for the return trip = $960.00! Now add the cost of your cabin for the week which can range any where from $750.00 to $2500.00 Return flight to Thunder Bay $600.00, car rental approximately $350.00 for 1 week.  Same expenses as driving but only a fraction of the time spent on the road.  For those who have never been there you'll find the closer you are to LOTW it's rather expensive. Cabin rental for the week which usually includes a boat & motor can be anywhere from $1500. to 2500. per week.  I found if you were closer to Vermillion Bay, Eagle Lake, Ear Falls the rental fees are substantially lower.  I will never regret the time spent driving as I love the scenery, it's outstanding!"

992865,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 14:06:00,11391,Move to Kenora??? Geez man I hope your daughter is well off financially.  Kenora is a dump full of crime. Id rather walk the northend of winnipeg than downtown kenora
992879,kickingfrog,2017-01-27 14:54:00,8333,"Pros and cons.  Driving/accommodation costs can be split. Flights are per person, not to mention the hour drive (x2) to the airport (more driving from the destination x2) and all the fun luggage requirements of rods/gun for modern flight."

Beer store was dirty, grocery store not much better, drunks lying on the sidewalk.  All in all not a pretty site.  Cops had 1 guy in hand cuffs who had trouble walking!  This was in broad daylight.  I wouldn't want to be there at night!!  I understand mouth wash & shaving lotion are under lock & key in the pharmacy!  Get away from Kenora in places such as Nestor Falls, Vermillion Bay, Ear Falls much more friendlier & cleaner."
992906,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 19:24:00,11391,Yep. Kenora has massive alcohol and drug issues. Probably the highest per capita ive ever seen.  At night youll get stabbed for ten bucks.  Not a week goes by without a massive drug bust.  Its the only place ive ever seen that has a 100 person line up at the LCBO 2 hours before it opens.  The towns a mess in every way
992907,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 19:26:00,11391,"And yes any anti bactial hand rinse, aftershave, moushwash and spraypaint are all under lock and key town wide"
992908,grimsbylander,2017-01-27 19:36:00,3016,"I'd love to go there just for the whole vacation experience and the scenery. But I'd be leaving fish to find fish and for that, it's just too far. Imagine travelling that far and being disappointed with a 5lb smallie or a 8lb walleye? Now, a fly-in trip to a quiet remote lake is certainly on the bucket list."
992909,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 19:50:00,11391,Thats the thing. You can do one or the other or both.  There is SO MUCH LAKES its unreal. Im not joking when I say you can fish 3 lakes in a day no prob
992911,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-27 20:06:00,8243,"It simply isn't worth the expence. For far less money plus not wasting 2 days of my life on a plane I can get world class fishing right here in Ontario. I just can't justify the expense when I have world class fishing right here in my backyard. I mean right in my backyard, I'm watching the waves break on the beach right now. At my age I have to ask myself would I go if it was free and I have to say no. Ask me 20 years ago and you will get a different answer. Just the other day friends asked us to join them at their new place in Vegas, we only need to get there and back and we respectfully declined."

992919,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-27 21:45:00,8243,"Ricardo, I misread the OP's question. When I saw NWO my dyslexic mind said to me North West Territories. So any of my other post can be disregarded like many of my other posts. Of course I would love to get to North West Ontario, as long as I don't have to drive with Wormdunker for 22 hours. He can pick me up at the airport and I'll flip him a few bucks for gas. Actually that isn't a bad plan.  No you won't catch 150 Pics in a day. But 15 of ours will weight the same as 150 of yours, as Al Pacino said whoooorhaaa!!!  Kenora sounds like what I saw in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Regina and Vancouver. I didn't stay long in Calgary but I'm sure it's there too. Very sad, most were 1st Nations folks. We have a huge problem here in Canada that most Canadians don't know about or care to know about. The first time I was made aware of it was in 81' in Long Lac. The local in and out store had an electronic gate with a barbed wire fence covering and surrounding it to keep those addicted from robbing them. The guy that ran the store told us that without the security he would be robbed all day and night long. I told him he should call it 24/7 instead of 7/11."
992920,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 21:47:00,11391,"Yeah, but we catch a 100 then switch gears and get 10-12lbers in the same day???"
992922,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-27 22:03:00,8243,"C'mon man! Our average Walleye is 34"" and weigh no less than 10 kilos. You need a Salmon net to get the smallies in them. Stringers of perch have been known to sink a boat. I can wade in and pick up 25 pound Carp with my hands, that's actually not what  POTUS's people call ""alternate truth""."

The ONLY reason I do not go back is that it is 22 hours straight and I feel that probably deters most from down south...you can make it to the Florida border in the same amount of time it  takes you to get to Fort! As for the caliber of fishing and hunting it is simply second to none...the only species missing are the salmon and bows. You can leave Fort get 5 different species of of fish, shoot a moose, a deer and a handfull of bushchickens before its dark! And that's no poop! Everything would have to be perfect but it is possible. I miss that country badly and someday when I am done with work down here I will be back. So...point being its a long drive and unless your gonna stay its just to far of a haul when the fish are here as well."

Collin the owner stated that only 5% of his business comes from Southern Ontario, most of the others are Americans.  I have already started some plans to head that way again next spring.  Another bonus I was able to meet up with Manitoubass in Emo.  I really liked the area around Vermillion Bay & I'm sure you would be able to put me on some good fishing.  I'll get in touch as we get closer to spring fishing.  PM me if you would like to share some local info.  I know it's a long ass drive but I do enjoy the scenery.

992811,kickingfrog,2017-01-27 00:06:00,8333,"The 75 cent dollar and the fact that for some of them in the mid west NWO is the first great ""remote"" fishing.  During the 18plus hours driving to get there we pass hundreds (maybe thousands) of lakes that have great fishing. I've been to the north west once to fish Lac Seul. It was incredible and I will go back but the 4ish days it takes to get there and back really eats into a fishing trip and the gas budget. It's 6-7 hours for me to get to the Timmins area (or North of the Sault). I can fish/hunt the day I leave my house and the day I get back without a marathon redeye drive. Now, if I had my own float plane...."
992812,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 00:21:00,11391,"Never come here. The fishing sucks lol  Except wormdunker, HURRY up and get back here"
992813,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 00:25:00,11391,  Probably cheaper if booked in advance.
992814,Blue Lk,2017-01-27 00:25:00,337,"Come on guys! Where's your sense of adventure? I think I knew what the response would be,totally understandable. This area is a fisherman's paradise,one could spend weeks in the area & fish a different lake everyday. Lakers one day,walleye or muskie the next. It is amazing the amount of fishermen come here from south of the border,I spent 2-3 days a week as the PTOG (part time old guy) at the local tackleshop the last couple of summers.Some Saturdays we would sell between 150-200 fishing licenses to non-resident fishermen. The LOTW area (Kenora) also get lots of Manitoba anglers/"
992815,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 00:28:00,11391,"From kenora, to rainy river, fort frances, dryden, vermillion bay, ear falls to souix lookout is no doubt in my mind the best fresh water fisheries in the world.  Shame most canadians dont come. It almost exclusively locals and americans"
992816,OhioFisherman,2017-01-27 00:37:00,6623,""" California,Texas,Arizona,Florida ""  I'm from Ohio, in those states you would be fishing a long time to catch a walleye, pike or ski? A lot of the in between states also don't have those species or limited numbers and size."
992817,TennesseeGuy,2017-01-27 00:39:00,957,"1470 miles, one way, for me.    Worth it, every time."
992819,Joeytier,2017-01-27 00:50:00,3990,"NWO is way more vast, remote, undeveloped and fish-filled than 99% of NE Ontario, and once you cross over the big river into QC, you're back into NWO levels of remoteness.  The hwy 11 corridor starting in North Bay goes from beautiful but busy and generally tough fishing (compared to elsewhere in the north) to flat, boggy, boring terrain in the far north.  There are some really amazing places in the NE, but there really aren't any outfitters in NE that can compare to the premiere destinations in the Northwest and QC."
992821,akaShag,2017-01-27 01:06:00,2073,"<<<<<AHEM>>>>  a little ditty from memory, which at this stage of my life, may not be accurate....................  ""In Canada's North, where the moose go forth and there's little but frozen sod, all the people stink, and are given to drink, and make mock of the southern folks' God""  or something like that.  yes it is a beautiful part of the world and Lord knows I have been there more than once.  Did not know it was as cheap to fly as that example from m2b2, I might have to fly up for the LOTW kids derby!!!  And BTW, m2b2, have you put that ad about the kid's derby back up here lately?  You should have received a goodies box from me by now for the kiddies prizes!  But to answer the OP, I think most of us from the south (Ontario, that is) shudder at the VERY freakin' long drive up there, and most of us have very good fishing within a much shorter drive.  Doug"
992824,porkpie,2017-01-27 01:21:00,2521,"Come on guys! Where's your sense of adventure?   My sense of adventure crapped out on me when all the kids showed up.  In my 20's I traveled all over the province, and a good chunk of the northern states to hunt and fish.  Then kids came along, and I've got em from driving age to age 2.  Add to that, what Raf said, with limited time available, I can be at the doorstep of some pretty awesome fishing with less than a 3rd of the drive.  I would love to get back on Lake of the Woods though.  I had some amazing fishing there in my late teens and 20's.  I still remember catching bass after bass, with a heavy dose of pickerel mixed in right off the docks in Kenora.  Never mind the good times once the boat was in the water!  You live in a beautiful area.  I will get back there one of these days!"
992825,Fang,2017-01-27 01:23:00,1330,"A big part of it is pure marketing and advertisement. NWO has to be up there as one of the top TV destinations for all those fishing shows. Muskie hunter, Linders, Nipigon, Lake of the woods - you can't sit down for an evening of fishing shows without bumping into some segment from up there. Plus with lodges it's so much easier to cross the border and attend some of the big fishing outdoor shows in the US. Can't say I see a ton of NWO lodges down in Toronto for the spring shows anymore"
992826,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 01:24:00,11391,"Your MORE than welcome to come doug!!!  Funny story, and yes I meant to email you a thank you letter for your kind donation! Sorry about that!  It came in last week. And my wife decided to take a look. And hooked herself in the finger lol. Not bad but I gotta few swears out of her lol.  Thanks again buddy!!!"
992827,akaShag,2017-01-27 01:35:00,2073,"Back to m2b2, sorry your wife got her finger caught on a hook, there were a few hundred of them in that box!And you should re-post your notice about that derby so that other folks here might contribute also!  And finally, be careful what offers you make!  Looking at that cheap air fare, a LOTW winter trip might well be on my radar.  Last winter when we had crappy ice down here, I flew to the Yukon for ice fishing.  This year it might be NWO...............  Doug"
992828,Blue Lk,2017-01-27 01:36:00,337,"Just to let you know,Wpg Man is a little over 2 hrs to Kenora (LOTW) & 3 to Vermilion Bay. ThBay is 4 1/2 to V Bay & 5 1/2 to the Kenora area.The drive to TBay sucks,the drive from the Manitoba border to our area is very scenic. I advise all my visitors flying in from the east to take the Winnipeg route."
992829,Raf,2017-01-27 01:39:00,3495,"we may not have the 'numbers' lakes that you do up there but we have no shortage of trophy waters and varieties of species. all accessible by hooking up the boat to the truck and driving a couple of hours.  no flights, no car rentals, no boat rentals, no 20hr drives.  wanna catch a 20-30lb lake trout or giant chinook? fish lake ontario wanna catch a 30"" walleye? fish erie or boq wanna catch a trophy muskie? fish georgian bay or st lawrence wanna catch 5 muskies in a day? fish st. clair wanna catch a 6lb smallie? fish simcoe or erie wanna fill your bucket with perch? fish simcoe  i think we're a different market than the american customers you see who may get out fishing 1, 2 or 3 times a year.  we have good fishing in our backyard and we do it often, just like you locals to NWO.  would you guys fly up to yellowknife to fish lakers or pike? propably not because you can fill your boots with those fish in your own backyard."
992830,kickingfrog,2017-01-27 01:41:00,8333,Glad I took the time to respond.
992831,Whopper,2017-01-27 01:48:00,2174,"I've been all over Ontario except to the Timmins area and north of there. To me hands down NWO is hard to beat and I live less than three hours from one of the best walleye lakes around, Lake Erie.  Raf has some valid points as far as catching fish but each of those places has a bit more traffic"
992833,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 01:58:00,11391,"Yeah i posted that just to show how cheap a ticket is.  Winnipeg is the better route no doubt!  Way more scenic as well  For rainy lake though,  go tbay route  To vermillion souix lookout kenora ear falls def. Go winnipeg route"
992834,manitoubass2,2017-01-27 02:01:00,11391,"Fly. Its obviously faster and cheaper.  But yeah, for some if ya got great fishing in your area its kinda hard to justify.  Until ya spend a week on LOTWs and catch trophies of 6+ species"

Just kidding, mostly and I've been up there many, many times. I like it. It is probably tougher to measure Southern Ontario visitor counts  because we get to use the same license up there as we down here. Americans have to pick up a non-resident license."
