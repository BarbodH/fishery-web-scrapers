Anyway, here is the first of a few videos I have to make , feel free to ask questions, Looks like you found a good spot in Jamaica with decent fish. Enjoyed watching you fish. You were hoping to bring in a large Cuda without a leader?"

Actually its Antigua, not Jamaica. Lol...no was not expecting to get one without a leader, but forgot the wire at the house that morning....DOH!"
994105,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-11 20:40:00,8243,"Simon, one of my favorite video's from you so far. Epic. I have yet to land a Cuda. Looking at that rough Coral all I can picture is me talking a header on it, Coral hurts bad enough then the 24 hours of Coral Flu."
994209,Woodsman,2017-02-13 13:41:00,1286,Nice video.
994213,Headhunter,2017-02-13 14:27:00,5703,"Simon, I always look forward to this report! It looks like a blast! i can see it now, the family is frolicking on the beach and if they needed to findme, well, they would know where i would be! I could spend an entire week fishing that spot! Thanks so much for the report! HH"
