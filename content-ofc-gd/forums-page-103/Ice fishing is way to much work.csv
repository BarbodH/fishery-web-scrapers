992478,grimsbylander,2017-01-23 15:04:00,3016,Ever trolled when ice fishing??  https://www.theweathernetwork.com/us/news/articles/extreme-weather/inventor-transforms-ice-into-spinning-carousel-see-it-here/78222/
993369,John Bacon,2017-02-03 19:08:00,3277,Here is another option for hard water trolling.  You don't need a hold big enough for a boat.
993371,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 19:17:00,11391,"Yeah that won't fray your line lol  ""Here hold my beer"" moment lol"
993372,Acountdeleted,2017-02-03 19:44:00,2562,"I love ice fishing at least as much as soft water.  I don't think I could choose one over the other.   I'm the same. I'd never catch Lake Trout, Burbot or Whitefish if we didn't have frozen winters in Canada.  All the change in temp means is its time to start targeting another species. Works out well too. November 5th I start thinking about ice fishing. Begining to end of April I have had my fill and can't wait to break out the long rods. Wouldn't trade where I live for the world to be honest."
991369,aplumma,2017-01-16 18:39:00,6896,I don't know how you all have the energy to go ice fishing I was too tired to even wet a line.     Art
991373,OhioFisherman,2017-01-16 18:54:00,6623,"LOL, all that rowing is tough work!"
991374,manitoubass2,2017-01-16 18:56:00,11391,Lol
991376,Acountdeleted,2017-01-16 19:11:00,2562,The motor wasn't much help at all.
991380,CJGuelph,2017-01-16 19:38:00,16,Your doing it wrong;)
991381,captpierre,2017-01-16 20:10:00,2521,How was getting it up on plane?
991402,grimsbylander,2017-01-16 22:26:00,3016,Ok until someone wants to troll.
991403,irishfield,2017-01-16 22:34:00,26272,I think Art is trolling.. from the warmth of Virginia !!
991422,manitoubass2,2017-01-16 23:58:00,11391,I wonder if they are jigging???
991430,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-17 01:17:00,8243,That is not ice fishing. It was the May Walleye opener in the near North 2014. Remember?
991435,GBW,2017-01-17 02:30:00,8460,That is not ice fishing. It was the May Walleye opener in the near North 2014. Remember? That's part of Simcoe still from the looks of it...
991448,LeXXington,2017-01-17 03:20:00,1928,At least they have life jackets on
991561,SylvanOwner,2017-01-17 22:29:00,266,Do you wait until spring to change spots?
991723,aplumma,2017-01-18 19:25:00,6896,We actually do not ever get safe ice here. The best I have seen is pond skating. We do get ice that forms near the shore and will break off in sheets and damage docks on the river. We put a triangle of steel on the upriver side of docks to break up and redirect the sheets of ice in the spring. It is just enough to keep you off the water but not enough to fish thru. As we speak we have clear water and can launch a boat on any of our water right now.  Art
991729,OhioFisherman,2017-01-18 19:41:00,6623,"No ice here either, one of my neighbors has a half acre pond in his front yard and I don't think it has had more than sheet ice on it all winter. Temps in the 50's for the next few days, some of my friends may be having mid winter bass tournaments!"
992239,Dara,2017-01-21 04:33:00,3052,"You're   And for you southerners.  How can you live without ice fishing ?  I have friends coming from Ohio,Indiana, Kansas and Florida just to play in the snow next week."
992241,manitoubass2,2017-01-21 04:54:00,11391,I love ice fishing but if I had perma soft water I certainly wouldnt complain!
992242,GBW,2017-01-21 04:57:00,8460,but if I a had perma soft I certainly wouldnt complain! Huh?
992244,Dara,2017-01-21 04:59:00,3052,The only reason I snowmobile and ice fish is because we have snow and ice and I'm not going to skip a quarter of my life.  Oh yeah. Also. Ice fishing is the best
992247,manitoubass2,2017-01-21 05:11:00,11391,Glad you enjoy it that much! I do too but Ill still take flaccid water over viagra water. Although I heard from geoff cialis water is the best water.  Fishin is fishing and it all fun!
992248,MJIG,2017-01-21 05:12:00,227,"And for you southerners. How can you live without ice fishing ?   What's the furthest south that people do ice fish in a normal year, I wonder?"
992249,GBW,2017-01-21 05:22:00,8460,I do too but Ill still take flaccid water over viagra water. Although I heard from geoff cialis water is the best water.  Fishin is fishing and it all fun! Huh?  Never tried it or heard of it.  I'll be around for the next 4 hours hammering out things...
992278,Dutch01,2017-01-21 15:04:00,1431,I love ice fishing at least as much as soft water.  I don't think I could choose one over the other.
992301,OhioFisherman,2017-01-21 17:35:00,6623," What's the furthest south that people do ice fish in a normal year, I wonder?  I live about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland Ohio, about 25 miles due south of Lake Erie, defining a normal year here can be a problem! Ice here is known to be suspect most years, although "" safe ice "" seemed to more common in my youth.  The local weather has the high temp today at 62 f and we get wide swings in our temperatures that make you question the safety of the ice. It gets even worse as you move south from here, it's not unusual for Columbus Ohio to have temps in the 50's when ours are in the low 30's.  There is no ice here, there was a bit of thin sheet ice on some of the local ponds a while ago, but it disappeared. Once you get into Kentucky? Finding safe ice becomes even more of an issue.  https://www.glerl.noaa.gov//res/glcfs/glcfs-ice.php?lake=e&type=N&hr=00  Lake Erie lack of ice conditions!"
992335,aplumma,2017-01-21 20:31:00,6896,In Virginia we do not get safe ice on anything except shallow ponds. In Michigan we could go ice fishing. We get enough ice to make it at times impossible to launch boats at most places. The thing that stops us is mainly the damage that water would do if you didn't winterize the boat after each outing from dec to mar. I could go down to the river and shore fish with no issues right now. We also could get 36 inches of snow in the next two months in one storm. I had the motorcycle out today to warm it up to change the oil go figure.   Art
