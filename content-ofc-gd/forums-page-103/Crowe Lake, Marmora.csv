Would anyone know of a marina or someone who might rent boats and motors on Crowe Lake? Also does anyone know what species of fish are in the lake so I can plan accordingly?  Thanks in advance,  Dave"
994143,porkpie,2017-02-12 13:35:00,2521,"I've caught pickerel, pike and bass it was decent for all species.   Also got one musky In Crowe, but I don't really fish for them so for all I know the musky fishing is good.   Haven't fished it in years, I did ding a prop pretty good in there once ion an unmarked submerged Boulder. Watch for obstructions!"
994167,John Bacon,2017-02-12 19:33:00,3277,I used to fish the lake when I was a kid.  At that time it had good populations of walleye and muskie; and also had bass.The walleye fishing really dropped off; and now there are pike in the lake; so the muskies may be hard to come by.

994204,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-02-13 11:46:00,535,Haven't fished it but I was told there's lots of pike which has dropped the musky population drastically. I imagine walleye are harder to come by too than in years past but that holds true for many lakes unfortunately.
