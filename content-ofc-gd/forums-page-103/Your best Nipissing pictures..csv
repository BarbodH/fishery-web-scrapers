993555,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 16:38:00,8243,"If that place was The Mo Z On Inn, I was never there either a few times. What was the name of the place downtown, dancin' girls during the day and a singles bar at night that I was never in either if the weather blew us off the lake during the day.  I have some Bear Creek pictures but they are either faded or are in black and white."
