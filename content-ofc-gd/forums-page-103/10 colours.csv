993410,spincast,2017-02-04 01:43:00,3279,I'm ready... this cold stuff can go away any time now  
993413,Fisherman,2017-02-04 01:52:00,7201,Well it hasn't been really all that cold so far.  Bit of a dip coming and then it warms up again.
993430,Freshtrax,2017-02-04 08:37:00,2215,"Soon buddy spring browns are around the corner , and if you want to hit niagara any time you have my number."
993434,spincast,2017-02-04 12:00:00,3279,"Soon buddy spring browns are around the corner , and if you want to hit niagara any time you have my number. yup, count on it. -I'll let ya know once she's out of storage. Installing a new motorguide with spot lock soon - once that is good to go so am I.  Just need some sun and plus 0 temps to make it workable for my fingers."
993441,Fishwilly,2017-02-04 14:29:00,206,Love to see the young lads enthusiasm! One of the reasons I go fishing.
993442,manitoubass2,2017-02-04 14:52:00,11391,Lol g is just that!!!  He's def. Not gonna be a problem at the launch ramp!  Kids a boss!
993445,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-04 17:03:00,8243,"Can I borrow your 1st mate, or hire him? The kid knows his stuff. It won't be long now."
993447,dave524,2017-02-04 17:29:00,4508,"Young lads need strong arm muscles, let him wind in the ten colours. That's the rod nobody jumped for when I fished the Big O."
993453,spincast,2017-02-04 21:25:00,3279,"Young lads need strong arm muscles, let him wind in the ten colours. That's the rod nobody jumped for when I fished the Big O. LOL - we take turns - when the 10 colour hits sometimes we say - isn't it your turn?   I got a 600 copper. I hardly ever run it  for the same reason."
993460,misfish,2017-02-04 22:11:00,29133,"If you reeled real fast, and G put it in reverse, that fish would be to the boat alot faster. Just saying.  We have yet to see anything cold here. Even you could fish in the open up here."
993473,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-05 01:30:00,8243,"When the rod with 10 colours out fires the conversation is usually, ""It's your turn,,,,, nope your turn,,,,, I don't think so it's his turn."""
993479,NANUK,2017-02-05 03:56:00,797,"10 colors is always ""The guest's rod"" in my boat ?"
993485,porkpie,2017-02-05 12:20:00,2521,Picked up 2 saltist 50's this winter for leadcore and 300 copper.  The higher retrieve should make the junk lines more bearable.  I'm ready for open water also!
993881,Moosebunk,2017-02-10 02:14:00,3970,MY GOD!!! The young fella was so cool to watch!  A mind for every little detail.  Well done!
993903,spincast,2017-02-10 10:34:00,3279,"yeah, he knows his way around a boat better than most folks we see at the ramps, regardless of age. Most ramps, by the time I have paid the fee he has the rod loaded, the fish finder ready, the radio on with the antenna up and all the straps and transom saver off and put away. He sets up the riggers, the trolling motor or plays the fish like a pro. Got his boat license 3 years ago now, and we are working on how to tell when the motor is trimmed properly by ear and feel. I know if he's in the boat we'll play the big ones to win."
993918,BillM,2017-02-10 14:02:00,17367,"Can't wait for spring, planner boards and shallow water browns! (The lakers aren't too bad either)"
994012,spincast,2017-02-10 22:54:00,3279,"x2 - ready for some sun, and the backward slide of the planer boards western end temp transects were looking promising for some early season hunting last time I checked - 42 degrees still"
994016,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-10 23:00:00,8243,"You are very fortunate to have that kid spincast. I have to say young fishermen, he ain't like no kid like I know around a boat. You are both in that rare zone where no one has to tell the other what, when, where or how to do something. Imagine the skills in 5 years from now."
994025,spincast,2017-02-11 00:09:00,3279,"you're right, OI I am fortunate. We have been fishing together now for 5 years, and  when it comes to the teamwork in the boat, we are actually pretty well always talking to each other when we are hooked up. If you look  you can see G identify a boat that is gonna cross our path about half way through and we discuss changing heading and speed,  a quick flick of my arm for direction and we start to cut to port, and a few seconds later we go to dead slow. Its a pleasure to work that well with anyone in the boat, to be fortunate enough that it is my son just makes it all the better. right now we are both in count down mode till the first spring outing."
