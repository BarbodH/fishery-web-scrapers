993651,charlied,2017-02-07 16:14:00,584,Can anyone recommend a hut rental place and area catching lots of perch? Got a hut rental from a family member for Xmas and wanna take my 3 year old fishing. Was near Snake island on Simcoe on Saturday and only got 1 perch till an hour before we left and hard to keep a 3 year old from going crazy. LOL. He had a riot once we started catching fish and it kept him busy. Of looking for anyone's secret hole and I don't keep any fish so I won't be depleting your fishing area. LOL Can send it personal message if you want as well  Thanks guys

993680,huzzsaba,2017-02-07 20:45:00,884,"I second Tim Hales.  A little pricier than others but well worth it. The ride, huts and very well insulated, and the fishing is great.  Minnow off the bottom works great."
993682,Acountdeleted,2017-02-07 21:20:00,2562,Terry Goy out of Gilford has always put me on perch. Nothing big but you'll tire your arms out reeling them in.

993685,misfish,2017-02-07 21:34:00,29133,"Is there ice?   Yes, when are you coming up? I got a long weekend this weekend. That means off friday. Oh wait, your off fridays toooooo. LOL  Terry Goy gets my vote as well."
993720,charlied,2017-02-08 04:04:00,584,Thanks guys. Just have to find out when I will be able to get up to that area.
993724,Big Cliff,2017-02-08 11:29:00,6899,"Tim Hales, kids under twelve are free with a paying adult (one child per adult). They also have floor boards that you can drop in so that you have 7"" holes in the floor which makes it a lot safer for really young (and old LOL). You will have to call and make a reservation though, they are super busy."
