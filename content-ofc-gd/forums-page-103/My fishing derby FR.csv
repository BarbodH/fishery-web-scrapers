My injury is a big factor, but also my team of volunteers are just busy doing other awesome things (EMTs etc)  I just want to apologise to all you that donated gifts for the event.  Its massively appreciated how much gear was sent. Very humbling. Amazing people here on OFC  I'm not sure if I should mention names? So feel free to pm me  My question is...  Would you like your donations returned?  Would you like me to donate them to another local event for fishing/family day?  Or possibly drop off the donations to some kids that I know already fish?  Whatever you choose is fine by me.  I can take pictures and email you, just where your donations went.  Really sorry I have to cancel. And thanks so much for your generous support.  Miigwetch,  Rick"

I would like you to donate my contribution to a local fishing derby for the kids.  Perhaps your community will be doing something special on family day.  I know you will do the right thing.  Good luck & dammit, GET WELL SOON!"
993456,manitoubass2,2017-02-04 21:35:00,11391,"Okay Brian! There is another local event the same weekend in memoriam to another friend that passed away. I've been donating my old gear to them the past 2 years when I could. It's a great event, and much like my event, supports the young anglers.  Thanks again Brian!!! Super appreciated that you sent a great donation!  And I'm doing my best to recover bud!!! I wish you the same speedy recovery!!!!"
