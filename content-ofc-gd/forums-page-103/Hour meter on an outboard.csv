994078,Spiel,2017-02-11 14:59:00,9065,I had one installed on mine Brian when I had it in for it's first 40 hour service appt.Handy for sure.
994079,aplumma,2017-02-11 15:28:00,6896,Brian it is just an inline meter that is tied into the key armed switch it is energised as long as the motor is running. The meters are around 30.00 and using a test light you can find the correct wire to tap into. It will be the one that will be energized when the key is in the run position and off when the key is turned off.   Art
994086,Rattletrap2,2017-02-11 17:02:00,1652,"Thanks guys! I have never seen them in any of the stores, but I'm assuming they can be found online? Would it just mount under the cowl on your tiller Spiel?"
994088,Fisherman,2017-02-11 17:25:00,7201,"Thanks guys! I have never seen them in any of the stores, but I'm assuming they can be found online? Would it just mount under the cowl on your tiller Spiel? You may be interested in this, I have a similar one.  Simple one wire attachment that wraps around any of the spark plug wires. No power required.  You can stick it to the tiller with 2 sided 3M tape. http://www.outdoorpowerdeals.com/tt2am-hour-meter-by-tiny-tach-reset-able-job-timer-for-marine-engines/"
994089,captpierre,2017-02-11 17:43:00,2521,I understand the timing meter  only measures time running. Nothing to do with RPMs. Not a great indicator of use of engine when buying used or wear and tear.

994100,aplumma,2017-02-11 19:52:00,6896,Tiny tach works well I have one on my Merc. It has a wire long enough to go from the engine to the helm.  https://www.tinytach.com/gasoline-tinytach   Art
994103,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-11 20:27:00,8243,The total running time that is shown when my GPS unit is turned on gives me total time to date and individual trip time. It gives me an idea how many hours I have used the boat since I installed the combo and the time I have been out for a single trip. I might zero it this year and see exactly how much I use the boat for the year. It is turned on before I leave the dock. Unless an hour meter has been on the boat since new it won't help a perspective sale some day.  I like that Tiny Tac unit Art. Sounds like I can even install it.

994151,lew,2017-02-12 14:56:00,12766,I picked this one up at the local Yamaha dealer for mine Brian and it worked well for the 6 years I had the boat. Forget exactly how much it was but it was somewhere around $40-$50 I think.  Just attach to the block with velcro and run the wire back and wrap around a spark-plug wire.    
994168,barrystrs,2017-02-12 20:27:00,75,I purchased a couple of units from ebay that are similar to tiny tack and the yamaha unit.  They were under $15. from china and worked great with free shipping.
994179,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-13 00:47:00,10439,I also picked up a cheap Chinese hour meter off ebay for my generator at the cabin.

My fisrt on a 25 Yamaha four stroke lasted almost ten years. My second is on my 40 hp Mercury four stroke. Handy gadget for prop selection as well.
994191,Rattletrap2,2017-02-13 03:36:00,1652,"Pretty good Lew that Yamaha has one made with their name on it. If it was only $40 - $50, that would be great."
994192,Rattletrap2,2017-02-13 03:38:00,1652,Looks like ordering one direct from tiny tach might be the best option. I'll try the place Fisherman mentioned in Mississauga too.
