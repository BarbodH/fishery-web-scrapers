993500,Smokercrafty,2017-02-05 22:24:00,227,"My worst ever fear of dying...... I don't care for anything here except for the fact that all the lives were saved. After that, I do commend the operator for implementing the safety measures required for such an unfortunate catastrophe."
993553,Sinker,2017-02-06 16:21:00,8692,"There aren't many operators out there that would know better than this one. Simcoe is a big lake,and the ice has been ""safe"" in that area for over a month. Stuff happens. Kind of like a car accident. You just never know.  Most other operators on the lake would have went straight to the bottom of the lake. This one has extra safety measures in place in case something bad, like this, happens. They did a great job making sure everyone was safe.  S."
993579,Dara,2017-02-06 19:48:00,3052,I hope the MNR is investigating
993582,Mister G,2017-02-06 20:43:00,1429,"I hope the MNR is investigating YES, results of the investigation should be done in 6-18 years."
993583,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 20:57:00,8243,I'm not in favour of legislating small businesses out of business but in a case such as this I recommend that all operators install these inflatable bags on these big heavy machines. They most likely saved a life here. As driving down a highway at 100 KPH is deemed to be safe accidents happen that many times result in fatality and thus we are always looking to improve highway safety by engineering safety features in automobiles and in the construction of roadways. If driving on an ice covered body of water can be made safer I'm all for it.
993584,Sinker,2017-02-06 21:04:00,8692,For what?
993585,Sinker,2017-02-06 21:05:00,8692,"Just to be clear, the airbags didn't stop the machine from going through. He got hung up in the crack. Had something happened and the machine went down, the airbags would keep it afloat."
993589,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 21:18:00,8243,The machine looks to be 1/2 under water from the few pics. The person that was in the machine said his stuff sunk to the bottom. I consider that to be more than hung up Sinker. You are right about the Natural Resources folks investigating. For what? Maybe a fuel and oil spill if there was any but other than that what's to investigate? No personal injury or major water contamination thankfully.
993591,Dara,2017-02-06 21:26:00,3052,They seem to be hauling people out on thin ice for money. Its one thing for a single private sled to go through but when you have a load of paying customers you need to take a bit of care.  They should at least be looking at the situation to avoid future catastrophie
993593,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 21:32:00,11391,"15"" of ice. I'd place the blame on an ice heave.  Pretty self explanatory IMO"
993597,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 22:18:00,8243,"Dara, there really isn't much to investigate. The machine hit a crack and broke through the crack and or got hung up on it. Was there operator error? Mechanical error? Was the operator under the influence at the time? The purpose of any investigation is to determine the root cause or causes and then make recommendations in an effort to ensure it doesn't happen again. Not much to investigate here."
993600,DanD,2017-02-06 22:36:00,2223,"I understand what Dara is saying; an investigation to determine that there wasn't any form of negligence on the operators part. Things like possibly the operator new it was chancy to cross the crack there; but decided to trim off an extra 15-20 minute ride to where it was known to be ""safe""? I have a good friend, that there's no way in the world I would get onto a sled if he were driving. The guy is nuts, taking way to many chances. Who knows, the driver of the bombardier might be related to my buddy  and should not be driving anything with passengers? LOL  Dan."
993601,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 22:45:00,8243,"You and I must know the same guy Dan. If he isn't going 140KPH on land, ice or sea he isn't going fast enough, he is actually a dangerous guy and I refuse to drive in a car with him. I don't think he will die of old age. But I have told him if he takes out an innocent person some day I will personally dole out some justice.  As far as an investigation maybe the OPP did talk to Hale's. I just don't see the MNR being involved here. I know Hale's wouldn't have anything to hide, there reputation is very good based on what I have read."

993642,Sinker,2017-02-07 13:57:00,8692,"MNRF has no jurisdiction here at all. Really, it was just an unfortunate accident that everyone walked away from. Lets not get in a huff about it and call in the authorities for nothing. Sheesh.  S."
993644,ketchenany,2017-02-07 14:08:00,3229,"We dropped a hut in a pressure crack years ago didn't go in that deep, they passed by looked at and drove off. Didn't even offer to help"
993647,Ronzo,2017-02-07 14:51:00,124,"Simcoe pressure cracks are wacky things. Spudded my way out the other day, got to the big pressure crack here and had to poke around for a spot where I felt comfortable crossing on foot. The ice under the pressure cracks hasn't frozen up either, it's just floating below."
993653,porkpie,2017-02-07 16:22:00,2521,What no inquest?  . Some people get freaked out over stuff like this but to me it just demonstrates that Hales is a good outfit and spends a few bucks to keep their clientelle safe!
993654,Terry,2017-02-07 16:37:00,14456,"Yup a pressure crack can open up in a few seconds any time of the day. and if the area has fresh snow. You can't see it No one in the world can predict them.   There would be no hut businesses if someone had to 100%  wait for. ""Safe ice"""
993660,Salmonidstalker,2017-02-07 17:46:00,265,I wonder what insurance rates are for these guys. Can't be cheap for liability insurance as an ice hut operate I would think....if some even do carry it lol.
993666,Sinker,2017-02-07 18:43:00,8692,"I'm sure lots don't. That's why I stick to a select few. The only way I ride in a bombardier is if I'm last in, and right at the door. I don't trust those machines packed with 10 or more people. I""d rather take my own sled and portable and skip the cracks like they aren't even there.  S."
993692,Mister G,2017-02-07 23:00:00,1429,"I wonder what insurance rates are for these guys. Can't be cheap for liability insurance as an ice hut operate I would think....if some even do carry it lol. If they have to purchase insurance they would go out of business in one season because none of their clients would like to pay 2 to 3 times what it cost now to rent a hut.  You want more unemployment in the fishing industry, just keep demanding more government interference until ice fishing in a rented hut is a thing of the past you tell your grandchildren about."
993384,Tjames09,2017-02-03 22:09:00,664,"Wont mention the operator (its a popular one), but their Bombardier went through the ice on the weekend.  Lake Simcoe still not super safe.   "
993385,davey buoy,2017-02-03 22:16:00,5505,"Not good,glad the two were ok."
993386,grimsbylander,2017-02-03 22:18:00,3016,That would scare the daylights out of anyone. Glad they're both ok.
993390,John Bacon,2017-02-03 22:28:00,3277,I glad they have the floatation.  I doubt that many people would get out before it went down if it didn't.
993395,Fisherman,2017-02-03 22:53:00,7201,"They managed to drag it back out with a couple other Bombies.  Ya, I can imagine without floats."
993400,captpierre,2017-02-04 00:07:00,2521,"Was going to post the question ""Will Simcoe freeze over this winter with the current cold snap?"" Seems unlikely"
993414,Fisherman,2017-02-04 01:54:00,7201,If the wind isn't too bad it might but how safe is another situation.  Close to shore fine but I wouldn't hit the middle.
993416,chris.brock,2017-02-04 02:05:00,4053," I don't think it's a huge deal what happened, but no need hiding the name the outfitter if the story is true.  Who do you want to protect, the outfitter or the guy thinking of taking his young kids out for an afternoon of ice fishing?  Most importantly, I'm glad everyone is ok, it could have been a sad story."
993418,Tjames09,2017-02-04 02:21:00,664,"Not good,glad you two were ok.  Wasnt me. I saw this on another forum. I was out with a operator near this one though."
993423,wormdunker,2017-02-04 04:11:00,1711,"Terrible situation!  In all the years of reading my fav forums, I have never heard of an operator going through.  Thank God for the flotation bags as seen in the pic.  I'm very happy everybody is OK."
993424,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-04 04:15:00,937,I never knew those things have flotation devices on them
993425,mikeh,2017-02-04 04:19:00,824,were they going to the perch grounds or the whitefish/laker areas?anybody know  very happy everybody is ok
993426,GBW,2017-02-04 04:25:00,8460,I never knew those things have flotation devices on them Yeah same here so good on the company for the added safety!
993435,Salmonidstalker,2017-02-04 12:25:00,265,"Wow. Glad everyone is ok.  They are lucky though, and it's a sign for people to stay off the ice. I'll never understand people and their need to be the first on thin ice or venture out the farthest. Some of these YouTube videos are of guys ice fishing Simcoe on no more than two inches. Nuts."
993436,Terry,2017-02-04 12:59:00,14456,"Lots of operators have their transportation go through the ice I got kicked off a forum that caters to cooks bay for posting photos and warning people , their people hauler broke though and was stuck  They do try to hide this stuff but a camera on every phone and social media. Nothing is hidden anymore"
993438,RickOnt,2017-02-04 13:35:00,669,"Terry is definitely right on.  There has been quite a few incidents over the years.  Even this one if it was not for social media, would you of heard about it ? The operators got together and had it out early afternoon  No ice is safe ice!!!   Things do happen"

993472,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-05 01:25:00,8243,"I as well had no idea those things have floatation bags. Do they all?  I am glad to hear no one died. I have ridden on a few on Nipissing and it always amazed me that they didn't break through. But it was always 8"" of ice at least not less. I as well have no idea why it would be such a secret not to name the operator. Did this incident ever become public? This doesn't happen everyday, does it? I personally would like to know who the operator was especially if I was someone that ventures out with these operators or intend to. Why the hush, hush?"

He didnt just suddenly break thru the ice either. The story i have is there was a new crack he had to cross. There is 15"" of ice there. Plenty safe, but stuff happens.   S."
993488,Salmonidstalker,2017-02-05 13:20:00,265,"I don't think anyone can honestly say that any ice over water is safe. ""Safe ice"" is a bit of an oxymoron.  Saying ""stuff happens"" implies right there that no ice is safe."
993489,Terry,2017-02-05 13:51:00,14456,I agree Fresh snow and an open pressure crack is one of those things you have no control over
993494,porkpie,2017-02-05 16:49:00,2521,"The back end of my quad collapsed through the ice on 22 inches once, fortunately the front end stayed up.  Stuff happens.   Floyd Hales is an excellent operation!"
993497,lunkerbasshunter,2017-02-05 18:42:00,2585,Operator should know better.  Even though they have those floatation things attached it has been said a lot this winter that ice is unsafe on simcoe.  Glad everyone got out safe this time.
