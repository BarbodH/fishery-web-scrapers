993411,farsider,2017-02-04 01:44:00,456,Nice!  Thanks guys.  That looks great!
993412,GBW,2017-02-04 01:51:00,8460,I've been and gotten some great deals hence the share.  To bad this year it's not on a kids weekend so I'll more than likely be working but will be trying to trade the day off to get there.
993429,manitoubass2,2017-02-04 04:54:00,11391,I'm envious.
993432,Garnet,2017-02-04 11:27:00,2056,It's at the high school this year. Just a little west and behind Home Depot.
993443,Ron,2017-02-04 16:01:00,1683,"I will be helping out at 2 booths there this year. Gremlin's Custom Baits and Handlebarz.  For a 1 day swap/show, it is very very busy!  Admission is the best, bring a canned food or 2 or 3, afterall, it is for the unfortunate."
993450,Crazy Ivan,2017-02-04 20:45:00,184,"Sounds like fun, is this an actual tackle swap or vendors selling their products?"

993587,Sinker,2017-02-06 21:13:00,8692,This ALWAYS happens on my weekend to work. I haven't made it yet. DAMN!!
993618,Ron,2017-02-07 02:36:00,1683,"Sounds like fun, is this an actual tackle swap or vendors selling their products? Last year, there were many swap miesters there. I sold a dozen used reels and at least 6 rods myself. I don't recall many used lures but a good number of rods, reels, nets, downriggers, cannon balls."
993810,206,2017-02-09 02:42:00,563,I've been going since the downtown bass anglers ran this outa the back of a bar at Iroquois Park in whitby....Altho it has become somewhat commercialized  there are still some swap guys and I have found some super deals over the years. I enjoy attending this show Pete puts on and has worked to grow. Work permitting I'll be there again this year!
993826,oldphart,2017-02-09 13:00:00,665,"~~~~This swap meet gets bigger and bigger every year, and it's a blast seeing old friends and putting faces to name you met on line"
