He used to manage the old Fishing Plus store on Ronson Drive in Etobicoke before it changed to JB's. He was also somehow involved with Bob Izumi i think. He was a great guy to deal with while he managed the store. i just wonder if he is in the fishing industry somewhere  today?"

It was long out of warranty and I went in to talk to Ron about what he would recommend as a new replacement. He said this should never happen and he called Eagle/Lowrance to arrange for me to take the unit into their office in Mississauga. They told me to choose whichever unit I wanted within the same range of unit. Replacement was no charge! I chose a Lowrance X-60 with speed and Temp. For this reason, I remain loyal to the brand. Ron could have easily sold me something else, but chose to go to bat for me. I will never forget Ron or the company for that. I never even knew the man prior to that visit. Speaks volumes about his character though."
