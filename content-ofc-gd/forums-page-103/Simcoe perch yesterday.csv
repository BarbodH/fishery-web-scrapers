994206,turtle,2017-02-13 12:34:00,274,Walked out of Sibbald Point PP yesterday morning ($10.25/day to park).  1-2 feet of snow on the ice & at least another 6 inches fell while I was out.  Tough walking but good for sleds.  Almost whiteout conditions at times but I was in a portable hut.  Ice estimated at least one foot closer to shore & a few inches less going further out.  Only caught  12 perch but 8 were nice jumbos.   MNR doing creel survey in the parking lot.  Area of bad ice/slush right in front of boat ramp -on foot should go around it.
