993576,Sinker,2017-02-06 19:26:00,8692,"I had a guy give me hell for launching to the side of the concrete pad one time, because he was taking too long getting his boat out. I gave up on waiting and just backed down the gravel, dropped the boat in, and he went nuts saying that I was launching out of turn, I was wrecking the gravel...blah, blah, blah.....I didn't say a word, just parked and hopped in the boat laughing while he struggle to line up the rollers on his fully submerged trailer.  S."
993592,Fisherman,2017-02-06 21:26:00,7201,"That's why I have a self centering roller at the back, marvelous item."
993596,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 21:48:00,8243,"For entertainment get a table on the deck at Hoover's Marina in Nanticoke on any weekend. Prime time is on the Sunday of the Pottahawk bash weekend watching hung over boaters try and retrieve their big Go Fast boats. One youngster put a 15 foot long gouge in his shiny Cigarette boat. His buddy says ""your father is gonna kill you"", he replied ""he doesn't know I took the boat"", ouch.  I am still seething about that ramp, I go and park the trailer and my wife (her 1st time putting the boat in) who I left on the dock is holding the bowline, the boat is now on the opposite side of the dock with the engine against the shore, lucky it was grass and not a wall. There are at least 6 guys standing there holding their drinks watching her struggle and a restaurant patio full of people 25 feet away. I ripped into those guys and they slithered away. My fault 100% for not tying off the boat myself and shouldn't have put her in that situation on a weekend. I was wrong thinking she would tie off the lines. I was in a hurry too. So the moral of this story is to make sure you and the 1st mate know what each have to do and know how before launching and don't be in a hurry launching a boat. What is an extra 5 minutes to the guy waiting? I have seen fisticuffs over 5 minutes at that ramp. Hoovers Marina has the worse launch in our area and it is the most expensive too. Besides the idiots, yes me too that day, those steel docks will leave a mark on the boat if you aren't holding the boat, they don't even have cleats or rings to tie off to just steel posts. Terrible, ask Fish Farmer. Eh Dave?"
993598,grimsbylander,2017-02-06 22:20:00,3016,"Any regular running bass tournament series you'll see 60+ boats prepped, inspected, launched and trailers parked in under 1 1/2 hr. Quicker on a dual ramp."
993599,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 22:36:00,8243,"Yes Grimsby, I have seen it and the organization of those involved is fantastic, even the amateur tourneys like the 444 it goes like clock work. But these guys launch almost everyday not once a week or a few times a month.  The more you practice the luckier you get.  The best ramp is at North Erie Marina in Pt. Bruce. You are in and out in no time, 1 worker gets in the water and pulls your boat to the dock, a second person follows you to the parking lot in the Golf cart and gives you a ride back to the launch. By the time you get back the next boat in line is in the water and the guy in the Golf cart follows him etc. Smooth operation. These guys know the faster in and out the more money they make. Most marinas are there to take your money and that's as far as they go."

Port Maitland is also nicely set up to chew up boats if not tied off properly.  Your story reminds me of when HTHM took me out and while waiting to load we watched a kid drop his parent's boat off the roller trailer because he had unhooked everything before backing down the ramp. Quick tap of the brakes and it's off!"
993614,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-07 01:07:00,8243,"It sure is a Zoo at Hoovers and yes that free steel dock at Maitlland can put a nice dent on your boat especially if the wind is up. For that reason I go to Fishmaster's up river a few miles.  I saw a boat slide off the trailer 4 feet from the water. The guy had put that slippery plastic stuff on the bunks like Fish Farmer has and unhooked before he was in the water, I learned a good lesson that day. They sure are slippery. He snapped the bottom end off his new Yamaha and tore the transom off the boat. Man I felt for the poor guy."

993699,SuperDave,2017-02-07 23:58:00,204,"My fishing partner have it down to a science. My boat or his, One backs boat in the other is in boat. If you have 2 experienced people piece of cake. Fire the boat in and don't take up dock space. Truck gets parked, partner picks you up at dock, bass start biting and all is good. A bit tougher on your own but if you plan properly and take your time its only a few minutes. Crystal Beach launch is a great place to have a picnic if you want to watch some boat launch follies."
993711,chris.brock,2017-02-08 01:57:00,4053," My brother and I used to pride ourselves on our launches at Bronte, Port Credit and Queenston etc.  I'd be backing in quick, he'd be on the tiller and dry start it a bit early, I'd hit the brakes and off he'd go and I'd leave a little rubber on the ramp on my way up."
993101,captpierre,2017-01-31 16:28:00,2521,Thought this might be interesting  http://www.scout.com/outdoors/wired2fish/story/1744765-8-unwritten-rules-of-boat-ramp-etiquette
993103,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-31 16:47:00,10439,Saw that in my FB feed this morning. Agree 100%. Should probably print it on a 4X8 piece of plywood and put it at all boat ramps. Lot of people around here could do with reading it.
993105,manitoubass2,2017-01-31 17:15:00,11391,"I dont even wanna look lol.  Here is mine  Stay to the side until everything is ready  Stay to the side to chat about the 26lb walleye you lost at the boat.  Deploy fast. If you're new to launching, wait for traffic to slow down before taking up the ramp for 20 mins  Unload the same way you deployed, up and out of the way. Everything is fine in the boat until your moved  At a wide launch, dont launch in the middle.  For gods sake unplug your lights before launching. I dont wanna hear about your lights being blown out again"
993113,Garnet,2017-01-31 18:09:00,2056,I lay the blame at the door step of marine dealers.  They just want to cash the check and fix what people break.  Can't tell you how many times I've offered assistance to be told they just picked the boat up down the street.
993115,GBW,2017-01-31 18:14:00,8460,"I recall my dad and I out for a walk with my kids and we were passing the ramp and 4 guys waved us down asking for help to launch the boat.  My dad hopped in the suv and was in the water ready to go in under a min to have the guys say ""hey Mr how you so good at that?"".  Not to sure how they got the boat out later that day..."
993116,NANUK,2017-01-31 19:11:00,797,"This needs to be posted on all boat ramps, specially at Bluffers."
993162,Gallie,2017-02-01 02:20:00,1215,Dont get me started on bluffers... Nothing like several hours of combat trolling followed by seeing those people in action at the launch lol.
993174,NANUK,2017-02-01 13:03:00,797,"Not much better in the morning either, guys with boat/trailer backed in the water, headlights on and still offloading $hit from the truck. Launching in the middle of the double ramp, Boat tied on the ramp while they are gone to park their truck and trying to figure out the parking meter or looking for some change ?"
993177,Mister G,2017-02-01 14:06:00,1429,"I lay the blame at the door step of marine dealers.  They just want to cash the check and fix what people break.  Can't tell you how many times I've offered assistance to be told they just picked the boat up down the street. You can't fix stupid...........dealers are not to blame, boaters are.  Now, I like the action at the boat ramp. Many times when I don't want to fish I take the bride down there to see all the stupid things that happen there. Sometimes we have a picnic while waiting for more action to show up.  One time I ran into one of my fishing buddies that had his girlfriend out with him on Erie. He was forced in early because she got sick in 1' waves.......LOL  But anyways he was pulling the boat out and no one else was around. I parked about 100 feet from him as he was struggling to get the boat on the trailer straight and he was yelling at the girlfriend. I sat there and laughed for about 2 minutes before he looked up and recognized me. Then he started to yell at me and I laughed even louder before going over there to help him. I will never forget that day."
993180,Ronzo,2017-02-01 14:53:00,124,"Not a religious man, but reading that article all that I have on my mind is a loud ""AMEN!!"".  Launch is also not a place to crack beers and talk about last night's party.. had fun with that one last year at Balsam."
993181,Garnet,2017-02-01 15:05:00,2056,Yes dealers are to blame. They know when people have zero experience launching boats and they take the money a send out for us to deal with.
993184,Sinker,2017-02-01 16:26:00,8692,"Well, there should also be something in there with regards to helping someone who is having trouble. I know I have helped many people at the launch, simply because I could tell they didn't know what they were doing, and were under pressure making it worse. If you see someone doing something wrong, or you know there is an easier way, offer to help them.  Biggest mistake I see is people trying to load their boats with the trailer too far in the water.  S."
993186,manitoubass2,2017-02-01 16:31:00,11391,Yep. We've all been there.  Nothing wrong with helping and giving some pointers!
993188,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-01 16:58:00,10439,"The best advice I give people is to put a set of these on your trailer.  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-5-Bunk-GuideOns/product/1309251421/  When set up correctly all you have to do is drive straight on and hook up the winch, tighten her up, tilt motor and drive away. I can launch and load faster by myself than pretty much anyone I have seen up in the NWT. When my buddy and I used to fish together in Ontario we could launch or load in under 30 seconds. It's not rocket science. A little practice goes a long way."
993189,Fisherman,2017-02-01 17:12:00,7201,"Get in, get out, Quit farting about.  If I can't launch or retrieve within 2-3 minutes, I'd be ashamed."
993190,BillM,2017-02-01 17:33:00,17367,"I've attempted to help people and have been told that they've got a handle on the situation, lol.   I just stand back and watch the show."
993192,AKRISONER,2017-02-01 18:21:00,5558,thank baby jesus for owning waterfront property...
993202,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-01 21:33:00,8243,Check your cranking battery before leaving home too. Mine had enough power to tilt the outboard to remove the transom saver but would not turn the engine over once in the water. If I told you a nut on the battery was loose would you believe me? How does a nut on the battery loosen on it's own? Now I check the nuts before I put it in the water.
993203,BillM,2017-02-01 21:36:00,17367,"My oldman likes to leave the radio on and the master kill switch, lol.  Luckily it doesn't take the kicker too long to charge the battery enough to start the big motor."
993205,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-01 21:52:00,10439,Had a dead starting battery on one trip last summer. Hauled out the trusty jumper cables and boosted off one of my TM batteries.
993206,BillM,2017-02-01 21:54:00,17367,"Good idea Dave, I should put some jumper cables in the boat."
993209,Mister G,2017-02-01 22:29:00,1429,"I've attempted to help people and have been told that they've got a handle on the situation, lol.   I just stand back and watch the show. Been there done that, so now I just watch.........  As far as jumper cables I have a short set made just for the boat for over 30 years and thank God never had to use them."
993210,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-01 22:47:00,8243,"I invested in a battery booster pac after the second time I had a battery issue. Remember Wormdunker?  Especially now since my kicker doesn't recharge the main battery and my accessories are all on my booster battery and I run my kicker for long periods. No need for cables and a good battery to boost from. People with dead car batteries and other boaters have needed it, luckily not me. It will charge a cell phone too as well as being a bright emergency light. Now they make them so small you can fit it one hand. If you have a boat you should have 1 onboard. It's the cost of a 24, and a 40 pounder."
993254,Garnet,2017-02-02 13:44:00,2056,My funniest launch assist was on Couch. We where staying at that camp just up the Longford rd. Day campers are in that parking lot beside hwy. Just brutal.  The launch ramp is in a creek nice and calm no wind. Buddy can back in when he finally gets there the winch is under water. I'm still patient. 10 try's later I walk down and offer assistance buddy curdy said No. The said yes please and just rips buddy.  I jump in his van pull out move trailer over and not in the water so far.  Told buddy to get in and drive on . He starts protesting wife tells him to shut up. One minutes later I have hook and out of the way.  She made him come over to our camp to thank me later that day.
993260,grimsbylander,2017-02-02 15:16:00,3016,"On two occasions I've launched my boat down the middle of a dual ramp launch site while guys are standing waist deep in the water, pushing and pulling on their freakin boats trying to line up the rollers. Drives me nuts."
