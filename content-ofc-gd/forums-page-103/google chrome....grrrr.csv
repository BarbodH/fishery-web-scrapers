Not to be confused by the red and white ""Red Devil"" made by ""I can't remember"".  I have many of those brand lures now."
993687,tb4me,2017-02-07 22:01:00,3295,So i switched to google Chrome.. supposed to be nicer faster and blah blah blah.. Every site works well except for this one.None of the links top left are accessible. I can see them but cant click on the view new content tab..Is there a fix or am i going to have to use firefox just for this site?.

993697,tb4me,2017-02-07 23:46:00,3295,Personally I love using Firefox. I had to quit using it.. far to many browser freeze ups constantly on windows 10
993702,misfish,2017-02-08 00:17:00,29133,Windows 10 here and no issues. No problem anywhere.

Chrome on Win10."
993735,Beans,2017-02-08 13:51:00,3339,I have google chrome...my complaint with it is getting rid of V9.com that downloads with it...grrr
993736,Ralph Field,2017-02-08 13:55:00,1018,I use goggle chrome and had to change themes as well. I never heard of V9.com.
993740,Beans,2017-02-08 14:50:00,3339,I use goggle chrome and had to change themes as well. I never heard of V9.com.  V9 seems to come with Google Chrome if you download recently but...all is good...followed the instructions to uninstall V9 and it is gone (for now)
993788,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-08 22:36:00,8243,"I too try to switch browser to Chrome on the advice of many here because I can't even cut and paste here let alone use the quote feature for some reason after they did a Win 10 update a few months ago. I couldn't even get it to load. My sis-in-law, our family computer Guru, loaded it for me. Before she left I asked hr to switch back to whatever it is I have, Explorer I think. I couldn't even get a page here to load properly and it was slow as molasses plus many other sites started going wonky. So I am going to live with it for now. My head is ready to blow up thinking about trying something else. One person loves Fire Fox the next person says don't even think about it. I know what a V-8 is, no such thing as a V-9."

993824,Sterling,2017-02-09 12:44:00,477,"I posted a solution to this problem here.  Essentially the site has a spot for ads, but the forum's content was accidentally put in this spot too, hence why so many browsers block the content.  It's not a problem with the browsers, rather, with the site . Easy fix too."
993838,John Bacon,2017-02-09 15:49:00,3277,"I started using firefox after I found out about on this board, bye netscape! LOL That is going back a ways.  But Firefox is essentially the second coming of Netscape.  I think it was codenamed Phoenix at one point, which does seem appropriate."
