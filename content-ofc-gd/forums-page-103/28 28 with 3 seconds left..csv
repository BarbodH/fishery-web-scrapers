993610,Rizzo,2017-02-06 23:58:00,4754,I missed the whole game except the last 5 minutes and overtime...apparently I chose the right time to turn on the tv.
993613,leaf4,2017-02-07 01:02:00,2466," Actually I just came across a funny article pertaining to the halftime show... Did anyone find it political at all? I didn't but this article I read seemed to think so and I thought it was laughable considering none of the ""political statements"" made were ever made in connection to any of the songs when they were released, until now apparently they're political statements haha  I should add, a simple yes or no will suffice, pm me to discuss if you feel the need lol don't want to stir the pot!"
993615,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-07 01:14:00,8243,"Everything is a political statement today, including the SB commercials yesterday according to the Whitless House.  This is NOT a political statement that I am sneaking into a OFC thread, it may be alternate truth however."

993626,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-07 03:40:00,8243,^ that is a good one Dave.  I have self deleted what I just wrote. It was political.
993630,FloatnFly,2017-02-07 05:17:00,1640,"Perfect timing! It's all a snoozefest to me  Actually I just came across a funny article pertaining to the halftime show...

993632,Mister G,2017-02-07 11:16:00,1429," yes, the songs she chose were meant to deliver a message. from singing america the beautiful to this land is our land, to born this way, whos lyrics alone are a statement, the song choice was 100%a statement All from a little rich girl from upper Manhattan, NY."
993721,mikeh,2017-02-08 04:06:00,824,"I am sure that a lot of coaches from all sports are going to use the fact that the Patriots and Tom Brady didn't give up , to motivate their teams if they are down in the fourth quarter or third period of their games.  great game"
993726,FloatnFly,2017-02-08 12:27:00,1640,"All from a little rich girl from upper Manhattan, NY.  and the point of this comment was what?"
993511,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 03:13:00,8243,"I might loose another 100 bucks, What a game."
993512,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 03:16:00,8243,The 1st OT in 51 Super Bowls. Oh my!
993513,LeXXington,2017-02-06 03:26:00,1928,great game!!! just wow
993514,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 03:27:00,8243,"I loose 100. Oh my! What a game, worth a 100 to watch it. No doubt who is the best ever team."
993515,woodenboater,2017-02-06 03:27:00,2277,Atlanta let that slip away ala Toronto Maple Leaf of old
993516,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 03:30:00,8243,Down 25 freeking points.
993517,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 03:31:00,11391,Unreal. Wow!!!!!
993518,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 03:32:00,11391,Brady is finally rid of the Peyton Manning debate. GOAT
993520,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 03:36:00,8243,"He is the best ever, no debate."
993521,PUMP KNOWS,2017-02-06 03:56:00,937,Crazy game
993522,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 04:13:00,11391,How about Edelman catch?  Gonna see that on the highlights for a month or more
993523,FloatnFly,2017-02-06 04:14:00,1640,what did we just witness......wow. and people are still wanting to burn brady at the stake for his so called 'cheating'
993524,wormdunker,2017-02-06 04:19:00,1711,"Wow!  Is all I can say.  Most exciting game I've ever seen!  My niece & her husband were here watching the game.  He was talking various bets, odds etc. which I don't really follow. During all the pre game chatter  I said about 2 hours before game time, I stated  - DON'T BET AGAINST BRADY!"
993525,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 04:28:00,11391,"Good day to be a pats fan lol.  I kinda feel bad for for the falcons.  I bet the parade had already started lol  Brady 5th championship in a league that caters against dynasties. Yet he does it time and time again with totally different teams.  Billechecks 5th taking over the the man who's name is on the trophy he was handed  Brady's 4 Superbowl MVP  It's no stretch to say the NFL is one of the hardest leagues of any sports.  Tom Brady might not be just the best QB of all time, he might be the best athlete of all time."
993532,AKRISONER,2017-02-06 13:47:00,5558,Good day to be a pats fan lol.  I kinda feel bad for for the falcons. I bet the parade had already started lol   being a leafs fan i know that feel man...that boston game on saturday had me feeling some type of way as well...yeesh
993533,SirCranksalot,2017-02-06 14:02:00,3291,"Don't follow football, but how bout dem leafs, eh?"
993535,Moosebunk,2017-02-06 14:12:00,3970,"Pay no mind to football all year long but if all games were scripted and played out like that, I'd be a huge fan. What a cool moment in sports history to watch."
993541,John,2017-02-06 15:27:00,2956,Great game and great outcome for Pats fans... NEVER EVER GIVE UP!
993544,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 15:43:00,11391,"It's not like they had an easy year either, Brady's suspension and missing gronkowski.   They just continue to find a way.  Scary to think 2 more wins against the Giants and they'd have 7 rings which is rediculous in the NFL.  Brady is on a rediculous training regiment as well. Funny people are talking he'll retire now. Nope, he'll play ""until I suck""."
993545,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 15:44:00,8243,"All Atlanta needed to do was kick a field goal and the Pats don't come back 11 points down. 3rd down and 1 and idiot OC Kyle Shanahan goes with an empty backfield and Ryan gets sacked putting them out of FG range. Run he ball, kick the field goal and the Falcons win. What an idiot. He has signed on as Head Coach for San Fran next year. His name will never be uttered in Georgia again along with the name Sherman."
993546,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-06 15:51:00,8243,"I just watched the presser with Brady and Belicheat introduced by the Commish, that was embarrassing, and Brady said he was always battling pain when he was in his 20's, now he has no pain. He will play until injury won't let him. Belichick can coach for 10 more years. Marv Levy was in his 70's when Buffalo went to 4 consecutive Super Bowls, Belichick is 62 I think. He has his 2 sons on staff coaching, mentoring them is number 1 for him now.  I begrudgingly have to say those 2 guys are the greatest player and coach of all time.  Brady is arguably the greatest athlete of all time, you are right M2B2.  Ali at 34 looses 3 of his last 4 fights. Jordon is a mere image of his former self playing for the Wizards. Jetter is a middle infielder batting .257. Tiger Woods is walking around with wobbly knees and a bad back no longer making cuts.  And Brady isn't done yet, he is an ALIEN."
993551,manitoubass2,2017-02-06 16:15:00,11391,Yep exactly! One of the worst calls ever. Your up like that you run the ball and it's all about possession time to protect the lead.  That's what makes it so hard to come back in the NFL.  Not to. Mention the falcons took a horrible penalty as well
993557,Mister G,2017-02-06 16:47:00,1429,Now that's why I watch NFL Football and not hockey. . . .
