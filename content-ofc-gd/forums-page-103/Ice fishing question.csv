I was wondering, would fish be attracted to the open water? I would assume there would be a large amount of oxygen with the wind and all."
993406,GBW,2017-02-04 01:17:00,8460,I'd be a bit worried about the ice safety around the open water vs trying to catch a fish.

Frenchman's Bay always used to have open water on the east side.  Sometimes there would be ice fisherman and boaters using the bay at the same time.  The east end has been getting ice since they build the new piers at the mouth.  I have not been there this year though."

994128,pics,2017-02-12 02:19:00,1268,We can cast a line into open water all year long here in Hamilton. Sometimes within sight of the ice fishermen...
