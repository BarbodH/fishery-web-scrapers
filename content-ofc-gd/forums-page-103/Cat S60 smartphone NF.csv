993279,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-02 17:33:00,8243,"Oh surface temps, I was thinking it doubled as a rectal thermometer. Ouch. My phone is only used to CALL people. I won't pay for data usage. That's what my laptop's for. If I was out in the world earning a living I'm sure it would be different. Just the other day I said if we still had a VCR it would be blinking 12:00/12:00/12:00/12:00. I don't know exactly when it happened that I turned into my parents."
993280,Raf,2017-02-02 17:33:00,3495,stop posting your links in bold font and your links alluvasudden work.  it's odd but none of your links work for me in chrome.  the odd time you don't use bold they work!
993281,wormdunker,2017-02-02 17:55:00,1711,"Thanx buddy I just bought a new iphone ES.  Same as an iphone 6 but smaller, same size as my 5S was."
993285,manitoubass2,2017-02-02 18:13:00,11391,Nice!  I know it's all personal preference but I could never switch from Android back to IPhone.
993290,wormdunker,2017-02-02 19:38:00,1711,"Yah I don't want to ""learn"" another phone either.  Had a hard time learning iphone!  This my 4th iphone & I can almost use the texting feature!  LOL!"
993295,manitoubass2,2017-02-02 19:50:00,11391,Lol. IPhone to any Android is tough to re learn.  I got this phone down in two days which is a darn miracle lol
993299,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-02 19:57:00,10439,I just googled it lol.  Your links never work for me.   You need the secret code!!!
993301,Headhunter,2017-02-02 20:22:00,5703,"Wait, you thinking of a different phone finally Joe?!?!?!?! Nah, I still have the Samsung Galaxy or what ever the heck it is... haven't turned it on since October! I'm just a fan of anything that say Marshall on it... especially if it is full of tubes! HH"

993333,Headhunter,2017-02-03 13:29:00,5703, 8 6550 power tubes 4 four preamp tubes 90lbs  of chest slammin joy! HH
993337,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 14:11:00,11391,Nicer than my phone! And certainly sounds better lol
993339,Headhunter,2017-02-03 14:23:00,5703,I rent it out to clinics on weekends I am not using it. Seems to do a pretty good job of sonic ally crushing patients kidney stones! It's actually one of the loudest/powerful bass tube amps made... HH
993340,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 14:46:00,11391,"Hahaha sick!  My brother in law plays guitar, I showed him your pic and he just shook his head and said ""I wish"".  I'm guessing that amp is highly sought?"
993341,Headhunter,2017-02-03 15:07:00,5703,"Hahaha sick!  My brother in law plays guitar, I showed him your pic and he just shook his head and said ""I wish"".  I'm guessing that amp is highly sought? It was only manufactured for a few years in the mid 90's, it was Marshall's answer to the Ampeg CL/VR and their last foray into the big power tube market for bass amps. They are rarer then hen's teeth as they did not sell well when introduced. The asking price at the time could have had something to do with it... $3k+ US! I picked it up from Craig's List a few years ago, for a much better price than it originally sold for... as for being highly sought after, i know I could sell it quickly, should I decide I am too old to move it around anymore. Metal band bass players would likely jump all over it. 250 watts at 4 ohms 400 watts at 2 ohms- to get to 2ohms, one would likely have to run two, four ohm cabs... that is likely to produce 125-135 db... equal to the volume of a 747 taking off! I've seen a few bar owners go white when they see me dragging that thing into their bars! I just tell them it has a volume knob. HH"
993344,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 15:48:00,11391,Thats awesome HH! Thanks for the lesson!
993346,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 15:59:00,11391,"More updates on the phone.  Battery life is incredible. Well over 24 hours while using.  If using solely as a phone, I bet it would last 3-4 days  Processor is not the best on the market, but it's incredibly fast. Videos play very nicely  It has a SOS button, which apperently works outside of cell phone service areas.  The speakers are loud, but it's not as smooth sounding as my Galaxy s5  Picture quality is great. But it takes weird pictures if you have a TV in the background. You get a ""halo"" type effect.  "
993348,lookinforwalleye,2017-02-03 16:01:00,4399,Ah the latest must have feature on a smart phone thermal imaging....  .....does the phone work I mean can you make and receive a call....
993350,manitoubass2,2017-02-03 16:04:00,11391,"It's incredibly useful.  But I bought this phone for it's durability and waterproofing.  I wouldn't expect thermal imaging on your everyday phone in the future. This is marketed towards industrial workers.  And yes, the phone works great!"
993182,manitoubass2,2017-02-01 15:25:00,11391,"Well I finally bit the bullet on a much needed new phone.  I had a Samsung Galaxy s5. Great phone, definitely served me well.  What I was looking for in a replacement was durability. Of course storage, function and a good camera were ony list too.  I had eyed up many phones but the Cat S60 kept coming back on top. So I pulled the trigger.  It took about of getting use too as one would expect. But not nearly as long as when I switched from IPhone to Galaxy s5.  Super easy to use, camera works great and  Finally a phone that doesn't feel like plastic!  If you work in industrial work or fish and hunt, I think this is about as good as it gets.  It's waterproof (yeah I tried it last night) up to 5m. Scratch resistant outta the box. No LifeProof type case needed.  And it's got a FLIR camera. For those that don't know what that is, it's basically a very expensive thermal imaging camera. Which if ya think about it, has alit if practical uses both at home and work  My son is sick today and it accurately told me his fevered temperature?  If your in the market check this phone out. Lots of YouTube test reviews available"

993221,manitoubass2,2017-02-02 01:26:00,11391,EC I'd bet youde like this phone better.  Doesn't hurt it's darn near 300 gigs of storage too.  And the battery life is crazy. I haven't charged mine since 5pm last night and it's still over half.  The weird things is it's machined. So you can't remove the battery
993223,leaf4,2017-02-02 01:53:00,2466,"Reminds me of the sonim XP7, though hopefully better specs... The XP7 is big and rugged but terribly slow for a smartphone  https://www.cnet.com/products/sonim-xp7/review/"

993231,manitoubass2,2017-02-02 03:05:00,11391,It's the infrared camera that measures temps. So it's not really an intended use.  Just thought I'd check it for accuracy
993232,manitoubass2,2017-02-02 03:07:00,11391,I don't know much about processors etc. But it's faster than my Galaxy s5.
