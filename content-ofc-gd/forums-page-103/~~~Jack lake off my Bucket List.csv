My uncle has a place on the lake there haven't been in a few years but the fishing is very particular, last time I went in October 2 years ago we did OK for bass, caught a small muskie and had no luck trying at the basin where it gets really deep.  Lots of panfish in the corner bays in my experience though. So much structure there I would love to spend a week or two combing through it"

994250,Big Cliff,2017-02-13 19:04:00,6899,"When we fished it in the past we would head straight out from the launch and typically fished in around the 30' mark. That said however without a flasher or fish finder you can miss a lot of fish in that lake. I remember one time we were fishing and not catching, then we started marking fish about 12-14' down, we quickly adjusted our depth and started catching some nice crappie. Sorry to hear you didn't do so well but better to be fishing than sitting at home watching fishing."
