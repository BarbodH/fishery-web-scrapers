I know about placing the numbers on the hut; but should I keep a copy of the registration confirmation in the hut? It has all my contact info on it and it would be proof that I didn't just make up the numbers? What do you people think? I would get the conformation letter laminated, if the consensus was to have it with me.  Dan."
993669,Terry,2017-02-07 19:25:00,14456,"on simcoe i only had numbers on the hut, never any other paperwork at one time i had 2 huts out both used the same number never been asked for proof of numbers or ownership"
993671,Sinker,2017-02-07 19:35:00,8692,"Yeah, you only need one number for any number of huts. I have used the same number for like 25yrs on several different huts. Right now I have the number on two huts....but neither are on the ice LOL....go figure!  I wouldn't worry about it. As long as there is a number on it you won't have a problem.  S."
