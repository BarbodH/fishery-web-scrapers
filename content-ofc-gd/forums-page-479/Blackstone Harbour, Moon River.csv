630209,addy79,2011-10-12 20:55:00,573,"I would launch out of Woodsbay Marina, right next door to Moon River Marina. Moon River Marina is a RIP OFF! James Grisdale runs the show at Woodsbay Marina, hes an awesome guy with plenty of knowledge to share on the fishing. PM for his number. The fishing can be tough for most species at times, but I tend to find the occasional bigun in Captain Allan Strait heading into Iron City Bay. the boating in this area is about as sketchy as it gets so proceed with caution!"
630212,Rich Nelson,2011-10-12 21:01:00,332,"The moon river basin is one of tge toughest spots around to hook a musky... Very low density, but still some big fish. Fished there on the weekend... Few nice pike on weedlines, and smallies on rock structure. ( be careful, that part of Georgian isnt charted, and loves to eat props!) can go from 80 fow to 3 ft Real quick...."
630334,backbay,2011-10-13 00:30:00,773,"I would definitely fish Woods Bay on the way over to Blackstone. You might remember to be careful of the entrance to Blackstone, it's a little tight. I fish jerkbaits about 90% of the time, and they work for me but won't tell you what to throw, so you can make up your own mind, but white, silver and perch colours work for me for bass and pike in those waters, and black for big fish. Good Luck!"
630342,spinnerbaitking,2011-10-13 00:51:00,1622,"Hey Guys This is great exactly what we were looking for, we don't want to do any damage to the Boats & this will give us places to watch out for & starting points Thanx & Tight Lines SBK"
630853,spinnerbaitking,2011-10-14 17:36:00,1622,"Hey Addy79 Do you have Woodsbay Marina phone number, I've tried to get it from Yellowpages.ca but no luck so far, even tried James Grisdale with no lick Thanx & Tight Lines SBK "
