629985,Moosebunk,2011-10-12 02:16:00,3970,Couldn't jam much more into that report Dan without having to have it hauled into place here by a monster truck driven by Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  Loaded dood!  Thanks for doing that up!
629994,ccmtcanada,2011-10-12 02:30:00,7971,"Loved this report.  A fun filled weekend with family and good friends!  May be a closer for this year, but something tells me there will be plenty of great times in the future!"
629487,danbouck,2011-10-10 23:22:00,4380,"Bittersweet Symphony  First off I couldn't have asked for a better weekend to close the cottage; perfect weather, friends, food and fun!  I got a late start to the weekend and got to the cottage around 6:30PM. We headed out to Neighbors Restaurant to have some dinner and came back to sit by the fire and warm up the cottage.    I decided to head out and try and get some night pics. It was a nice clear night and the lights from the US were nice and bright.    Saturday morning we slept in a bit and heading out on the water after a nice big breakfast. Homemade pancakes mmm... The water was perfect and so were the temps.    I went out to a pike spot to get some casting out of the way before the kids started to complain. First time this year that I didn't even get a follow. So off we went to get into some non stop perch action. I only wanted about a dozen keepers so I headed to a spot that would be non stop action all day but smaller perch.  Jacob didn't want to fish at first so he was in charge of the fish counter    So began the action. turned out I was wrong about the sizes that we would be catching, we caught a lot of decent fish.  Sam's 12""    Jamie's 12.5""    Jamie's 13.5"" that was too big for him to hold    I even managed some MONSTER    bass    After a bit SRT8 arrived and The Urban Fisherman shortly after that      Talk about stealing a guys fishing spot  Some random pics        I managed to get a catfish with a 4"" Gulp Alive, slimy disgusting things!      It was time to head in around 2PM and our perch count for 3 hours was 206 perch, not bad. Definitely hit my yearly goal of 1000 fish in the boat  We headed in and did a bit of work at the cottage. Jacob was pretty quick to hop on his ATV and start booting around.    My German Shepherd will follow him around until she passes out!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8HPGJQIx9E  I invited Ryan, Averie and Luke over after they were done fishing. We had some burgers and sat and enjoyed watching the kids play.  Jamie finally has a partner in crime    Jacob has a new good friend      We all headed down to the water to take some pics and to let Averie have a dip in the lake      Sunday was the boring day. We worked around the cottage all morning getting things cleaned up and organized. The kids sat down and watched ""The Rescuers Down Under""          We headed out for lunch and I taught the kids how to properly behave in a restaurant        So after lunch Jamie went down for a nap and Sam took Jacob for a bike ride. I was a little bored and was about to start working on things again. That is until I walked to the truck and seen these faces      I said, ""Boat Ride"" and they almost knocked me down to the ground. It made me think, since the kids were born they really don't go on any trips anymore. So we heading over to the boat and they went for their first boat ride in about 2 years.  I think they enjoyed it!        I was reminded when I got back to the cottage that the Simcoe Fair was on all weekend. I checked the events calendar and seen that the Tractor Pull was that night  I haven't been to a pull in a few years and this would be a first for the kids. The trucks and Tractors were amazing!                  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfPkV3ZEKmc   We walked around the fair and had a look at some animals and rides. I forgot how great the Simcoe fair is, WAYYY better than Cambridge, Paris or Rockton          Monday was a pure work day, we got everything boarded up for the winter. It was time to say goodbye to the cottage until May 2012. I took some scenery shots before we headed out for the year.            It was an amazing weekend that won't be forgotten and I hate saying goodbye to the beach for the winter! Bittersweet if you ask me.   Dan Bouck"

629497,Musky or Specks,2011-10-10 23:32:00,2710,Thanks for that report Dan. What no ice fishing out of the cottage?
629498,danbouck,2011-10-10 23:33:00,4380, Ice fishing in the bay but the cottage isn't winterized. It would take 12 hours to heat the place up to 10 degrees.
