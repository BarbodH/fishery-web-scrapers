630161,rocheleauc,2011-10-12 18:29:00,205,"Went out to a nearby trib this morning by myself for a few hours.  There was a large amount of people in the area I usually start at, so I immediately went up stream to try my luck/test the waters.  Water was very low and clear, but I guess I did alright, went 4/4, and hooked into a few salmon.  Can't wait for some heavy rain/more fish.  Anyways here's a few pictures.  Crappy phone camera,   I really need a proper camera.  Cheers.        "

630257,davey buoy,2011-10-12 22:24:00,5505,Nice fish! What about the guys who put their pins in the water while taking pictures with the fish? That can't be good either? That could be another topic later.
