630146,saneryin,2011-10-12 17:06:00,39,just wondering...where is 'Catt'?  is it a city name? I cannot find it in google map.  or is it an argot in this forum?  appreciate for any hint.
630170,tipupesox,2011-10-12 18:51:00,167,"The ""Catt"" is Cattaraugus Creek in the southern Tier of New York State.  Sorry for the confusion.  Tom"
630469,Billy Bob,2011-10-13 12:10:00,5865," Damn, there goes my secret spot...  ...I thought that was against the rules..."
630478,saneryin,2011-10-13 12:55:00,39,"thank you funny guys!  checked the map, the 'catt' city is 40+ km inland away from the river mouth/entrance city (silver creek). I doubt that is the city you are referring to  just curious, so, if you are going fishing on US side, you have to follow their regulations. but I saw discuss the quantity of Ontario rules....does that mean the NY fishing regulations is not so tight as that of ON?      "
629476,Billy Bob,2011-10-10 23:07:00,5865,The Lake Erie Jumbo's are still biting.....42 more today and 9 walleyes but only 1 was a keeper (3 pounder).....but the bite seems to slow down to almost a stand still by 10am......we fished to 11am only only caught 3 in the last hour.....The lake laid down like a big pond by then...
629676,tipupesox,2011-10-11 13:14:00,167,"Fished off the Catt on Sunday, 63 foot of water.  Took home 25 but released quite a few.  We were releasing 11 inch fish looking for anything close to 12.  Off the water by noon as it started to slow down around 11 am.  Emeralds were the bait of choice."
629695,corvette1,2011-10-11 13:59:00,1765,"nice day guys i went to the catt on tuesday had a good morning we got 42 great size all over 12"""
629898,Billy Bob,2011-10-11 23:35:00,5865, The Catt has been hot.....been getting my fish in 48-50'...however after the bite slowed up we did hit that spot in 63' and did catch a few but some were below the 11 inch mark where the fish in shallower were much bigger.
629899,mercman,2011-10-11 23:40:00,7054,Nice going Bob !!!
629916,Roy,2011-10-12 00:07:00,13728,"What size freezer do you have, Bob. Maybe I should send a memo to the perch community?"
629970,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-12 01:30:00,1107, I don't think to many make to the freezer Roy
630020,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 09:06:00,5865, It's a BIG Redneck freezer..... similar to this one... http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pictures/view/974270/
630029,Skipper D,2011-10-12 10:04:00,1970,"  How many pounds put away Bob? I have thirty six filets so far , my wife says we probably ate that much this summer also . I was hoping when i started fishing this year i could put away a hundred filets , i still  might if i can stay at it ."
630032,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 10:18:00,5865,"Good question Skip.....a question I really can't answer as I vacuum pack and freeze by fillet numbers...and that depends on fillet size....those puppies are so big that 6 fillets is a more then a meal for 2...in just the last 3 trips out I have froze over 100 fillets of perch and the odd bonus walleye here and there....  Speaking of walleyes, last year I caught a 8 pounder while fall perch fishing.....now this year we have caught several small walleyes just under the limit (14-14.5"") with the odd keeper in the bunch....prior to this we NEVER caught walleyes while perch fishing...can't really explain it..  ...but the walleye hatch must of been good a couple of years ago and next year looks like a banner year on Lake Erie..."
630034,Roy,2011-10-12 10:33:00,13728," You might want to check the regulations then edit your posts accordingly. This site is monitored, just sayin'."
630035,Skipper D,2011-10-12 10:34:00,1970,"To look in our freezer you'd think we had more , Beverly makes them up in packages big enough for a meal for two also . I'd like to start catching some thing other then perch , i hate trial and air , would much rather learn it first hand from some one all tho i 'am notr bad at fly fishing , find it to be very relaxing , some bigger lake fish would be nice one day ."
630051,Burtess,2011-10-12 11:28:00,901," I believe we have a 50 fish possession limit, so that would be 100 fillets, so I would think he would be OK  Burt"
630053,Roy,2011-10-12 11:33:00,13728, I wasn't talking to Bob.
630054,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 11:35:00,5865,Old Skip's wife might have a fishing license......and or they might have devoured a mess of them perch already.... ...or maybe he's donated some to a neighbor that's out of work....
630057,Roy,2011-10-12 11:39:00,13728,"Yes Bob, I'm sure ol' skip only has a few fillets. My comment was made so that noobs to fishing would read the regulations before thinking they could make a commerce of it, yanno?"
630058,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 11:43:00,5865,So what is the perch limit for Old Skip ?
630059,mercman,2011-10-12 11:48:00,7054,  Judging from his GIRTH....not near enough     JK Skip
630060,Roy,2011-10-12 11:51:00,13728,His is probably 50 perch with a sport lic. and 25 with a cons. lic. (Simcoe) That's not very many pounds of fillets.
630061,Skipper D,2011-10-12 11:54:00,1970,"There's nothing better then awarness that hepls in the saving  assets Boys , and cornering to the market on empty Highliner box's don't stand a chance if you get what i mean . The numbers are the numbers ."
630065,Skipper D,2011-10-12 12:03:00,1970,  all you can eat BB
630066,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 12:05:00,5865,I just had the wife weigh a package of six fillets on her weight watcher digital scale....13.2 ounces...thought they would weigh more.
630067,Burtess,2011-10-12 12:07:00,901,Aha.... I missed the pounds and thought he meant fillets.... thats a lot of perch!!  Burt
630068,Skipper D,2011-10-12 12:10:00,1970,14% more sales in scales today i can see after this one Roy
630070,Billy Bob,2011-10-12 12:15:00,5865, NO...no scales...we skinned all of them....
