630440,ChrisK,2011-10-13 06:20:00,2772,Thanks all for the kind words. Even though we knew this was coming there's was really no way to prepare for it until its here. Just one of those things I guess.
630441,motv8tr,2011-10-13 07:18:00,2587,"Sorry for the loss Chris and Carol, Arnie was a good fella....  Maureen"

630548,Ralph Field,2011-10-13 17:26:00,1018,Loosing a dog is a terrible thing because they become part of our family. Loosing a sister or brother is more upsetting however.

630270,Jewelbee,2011-10-12 22:42:00,422,"I'm so sorry for your loss Chris.  THE DOGS WHO HAVE SHARED OUR LIVES  The dogs who've shared our lives. In subtle ways they let us know their spirit still survives. Old habits still make us think we hear a barking at the door. Or step back when we drop a tasty morsel on the floor. Our feet still go around the place the food dish used to be, And, sometime, coming home at night, we miss them terribly. And although time may bring new friends and a new food dish to fill, That one place in our hearts belongs to them... and always will.  ---Linda Barnes ---"
630277,Remastered,2011-10-12 22:53:00,143,Sorry about the loss. I'm sure there was good reason for putting him to sleep. Take care
630287,Sawyer,2011-10-12 23:09:00,48,"ChrisK,  As you know, it's tough to see old friends go.  When one relationship ends, a new one begins.  Take all the time you need before you start a new one - that's the best advice I can give you.  Sorry for your loss and deep down, as most members have wrote, it was the right decision for your best friend.  Till you meet him again on the other side...  -Sawyer"
