629187,spinnerdoc,2011-10-09 17:55:00,556,"Got some encouragement to try this system out and so i did. I tried different flies, roe...pink worm took her    It was my first time in this area and didn't quite know what to expect. I was happy 1 for 1 not much but i didn't go home empty handed, plus i got to break in the rod Properly. Now i know how this rod feels fighting fish."
629188,misfish,2011-10-09 17:58:00,29133,Nice reel. Oh nice fish.
629189,spinnerdoc,2011-10-09 18:00:00,556,Thanks. She went back in...What i meant was going home not catching nothing sorry for the confusion
629240,rocheleauc,2011-10-09 22:05:00,205,very nice
629296,spinnerdoc,2011-10-10 01:49:00,556,Thanks
629306,Rod Caster,2011-10-10 02:31:00,5784,That's one fine looking catch! I'm hoping for some flame-sided speckles tomorrow.
629480,spinnerdoc,2011-10-10 23:12:00,556,"Good luck bud, them speckles are fine looking fish. Let us know how you make out"
629553,Leecher,2011-10-11 01:10:00,7832,Nice one spinnerdoc   Congrats Leechman
629554,spinnerdoc,2011-10-11 01:11:00,556,Thanks Leechman
629598,northernpike56,2011-10-11 03:19:00,717,nice  were you using a pink berkely worm? how do you rig em up? I have 3 of them and they seem to be catching the big guys  
629623,solopaddler,2011-10-11 09:27:00,8605,The pink worm strikes again!  Nice fish.
629697,Ralph Field,2011-10-11 14:05:00,1018, I rig pink worms many ways. I like to rig them wacky style most of the time. I also like rigging them on Mustad slow death hooks. I've also been known to rig them on a jig hook with a cone head weight pinned to the front of the hook and I also hook them through the nose. I only use the wacky or nose hooking with the smaller 3 inch worms.
629748,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-11 16:27:00,2690,  No need to apologise either way...nothing wrong with keeping one fish.  Unless you are fishing in a catch and release only zone. Nice bow
629864,spinnerdoc,2011-10-11 22:26:00,556,"yes it was, hooked a little offset from the middle"
629866,spinnerdoc,2011-10-11 22:28:00,556,"Thanks bud, Spiel had a hand in it. He suggested it bef i left to fish"
629867,spinnerdoc,2011-10-11 22:30:00,556,"Thanks bud, the section where i was was not catch and release. i was tempted but opted not to....a little oeffering to the river in the hopes it'll be nice to me again."
