630744,skinny,2011-10-14 12:58:00,442,ok was out last night fishing with Rich. well out banging against stumps in the pond we managed to break the mount on my trolling motor. we made it back in by tieing the motor up with rope (pic's to come). so anyway this is a Johnson Trolling motor I purchased a small pile of these a while back . What is broke is the clamp part for holding the trolling motor. I'm just not sure where to go looking for parts for this unit.

630748,skinny,2011-10-14 13:06:00,442,oh man the part was on that page but that is more than what I paid for all the units I bought going to have to look into this maybe fabricate one
630757,danbouck,2011-10-14 13:35:00,4380,post a pic of the part
630765,Roy,2011-10-14 13:50:00,13728,You could also part your Johnsons out and buy a Minnkota or MotorGuide. During the winter would be a good time to do that.
630782,Rich,2011-10-14 14:51:00,3927,"  lol          Good times, despite the bust! Tho Tim I'd suggest just fashioning a metal brace to the mount if you cant get the part."
630988,Dutch,2011-10-14 23:16:00,831,Try Emerald Isle Marine near Ennismore.
630990,Muskieman,2011-10-14 23:21:00,2472,Just replace the whole unit 100$ on sale @ CTC or Wally*World.... use it as a decoration... I think that it's served it purpose.  R.I.P Johnny..   Randy
