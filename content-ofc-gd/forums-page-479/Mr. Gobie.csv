630003,Remastered,2011-10-12 03:15:00,143,Mr. Gobie wont let me pier fish with worms  Mr. Gobie bad boy...
630007,mike rousseau,2011-10-12 03:32:00,4661,Use gulp...
630011,adolson,2011-10-12 04:47:00,783,"You're supposed to kill them, right?"
630014,Remastered,2011-10-12 06:19:00,143," Yup. Toss em on to the pavement. No need to step on them there are ""'tourists"" enjoying the view lol   What's gulp?"
630015,adolson,2011-10-12 06:24:00,783, 
630016,Remastered,2011-10-12 06:28:00,143,Oh. I think I see how that can help me catch more fish. If I drink it I'll have more energy to cast lures instead. Brilliant!
630099,mike rousseau,2011-10-12 13:49:00,4661,berkely gulp or gulp alive...  you can get almost any color or shape you want...  its a biodegratable bait... that looks and feel like a soft plastic...  the gobies cant get it off your hook as easily...  i put gulp on my worm harnesses and catch just as much walleye... and 1 gulp can catch a bunch of fish... most nights i can get up to 10 on 1 piece of gulp
630189,northernpike56,2011-10-12 19:28:00,717,"I catch monster gobies on gulp 3"" minnows  and jigging spoons"
630196,mercman,2011-10-12 20:03:00,7054,"  Ya but they dont eat it like with a real worm.You can use it over and over.And, once you get Goby juice on it, it becomes more attractive to other fish"
630263,northernpike56,2011-10-12 22:31:00,717,"  yeah I gotta agree with you there, but it just bugs me that I could have been getting a perch or a smallie instead of the infamous round goby. And I heard the gobies eat native fish eggs"
630408,mercman,2011-10-13 02:59:00,7054," They are definately a pain in the Butt But no matter what we do, they are here to stay.I usually drive the hook through thier brain before throwing them back."
630410,adolson,2011-10-13 03:06:00,783,"""Usually""? What do you do the rest of the time? Whack it with an oar? (Stop invasive species!)"
630414,Remastered,2011-10-13 03:13:00,143,Yes. Invasive species certainly don't help an already fragile fishery. Just look at how clear Lake Ontario has become from the Zebra mussels.
630416,northernpike56,2011-10-13 03:19:00,717,  Heard the zebra mussels cost the government millions anually trying to unclog water intakes. They have also claimed over $100 of my tackle
630422,Remastered,2011-10-13 03:31:00,143,I guess everyone has a unique sense of humor. Here's one: I'm a master-baiter
630455,mercman,2011-10-13 11:27:00,7054, the rest of the time.....i let my imagination take control of me
630514,Fisher_1,2011-10-13 15:04:00,22,"i havent caught a goby in years( yey). the last 1 i seen some kid caught it so i told his mom that she has to toss it on shore. well the little boy thought it was funny, the little girl on the other hand cried for about a hour. i was laughing a bit not gonna lie"
630547,adolson,2011-10-13 17:24:00,783, Stick 'em in Skipper D's pockets..
630598,mercman,2011-10-13 20:18:00,7054," Come on Man !!! I'm not that cruel .....sheesh, what a way to go."
