628907,Photoz,2011-10-08 16:35:00,792,"Depending on what area you are looking at, what you expect to pay, and what size apartment you are looking at, for you only, or a family . . . . .   if you're interested in Victoria Park & Finch area, let me know. I've lived in this building since 1974, it's still as spotless as it was when I moved in. Very quiet & family oriented. About 5 minutes away from either #404 or #401. I also know pretty well what areas to steer clear of!"
628912,nofish4me,2011-10-08 16:50:00,404,"Here's a tip; while cruising around the area you're interested in, ask a police officer where the good places are."
628916,esoxansteel,2011-10-08 17:02:00,1307,"Also check out BedbugRegistry.com to see if the building your lookin at has had any Bedbug issues, if it has the address and somtimes unit numbers will show, and stay clear  unless you want to be a blood donor"
628917,fishing n autograph,2011-10-08 17:09:00,2540,I think my buddy still has his condo for rent at yonge x eglington
628927,jedimaster,2011-10-08 17:40:00,3472,Just looked at 4 places. I think one had bullet holes in the elevator. One condo was nice. Do you know how much he is renting his condo for?
628929,fishing n autograph,2011-10-08 17:49:00,2540,"Nope, but I can ask"
628932,lew,2011-10-08 18:01:00,12766," If the bullet holes are only in one elevator, that'll be one of Scarberia's better buildings"
628947,fishing n autograph,2011-10-08 18:45:00,2540,"sorry jedi, my buddy just sold his condo, i didn't think he had because just the other day he was complaining about not getting a renter...oh well"
628974,jedimaster,2011-10-08 20:20:00,3472,I was trying to figure out if they were bullets coming in or going out. I think it was both...
629008,jedimaster,2011-10-08 22:15:00,3472,"I think we found a decent place, a bit more than what I wanted to spend but, it looks like anything under 1300 and your putting your safety at risk..."
629096,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 09:39:00,5865, OUCH.......I feel for you guys.....$1300 a month buys a large home with a 3 boat garage here.
629731,jedimaster,2011-10-11 15:41:00,3472,"yah, its pretty painful, but the money we are getting from the sale of the house is going to buy use some acreage up north. SO I plan to build a small bunkie and a giant garage."
629829,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-11 20:42:00,4399,  Ya but...nevermind!!!
629841,rocheleauc,2011-10-11 21:07:00,205,"Also just to add, if you have time check the stairwells for any signs of illicit activity.  They will tell you alot about the building from my personal experience."
629955,jedimaster,2011-10-12 01:06:00,3472,"good idea, never thought of that."
