630879,kickingfrog,2011-10-14 18:28:00,8333,How about the islanders and DiPietro? He has 9 years left on 15 year contract. He's played a handfull of games in the last few years and is out with another concussion.
630941,kickingfrog,2011-10-14 21:17:00,8333,"  There are cap provisions for long term injuries.   http://www.capgeek.com/faq/how-does-long-term-injured-reserve-LTIR-work.php  ""Teams receive cap relief when a player is considered to have a ""bona-fide long-term injury"" â€” injuries that cause a player to miss at least 10 games or 24 days. This is one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects of the CBA. Just because a player is on LTIR does not automatically grant the team extra cap space. In the event a player is placed on LTIR, his cap hit still counts toward the team's overall cap payroll. Relief only comes if replacing the player's salary pushes the team's cap payroll to date over the cap. The amount of relief is limited to the amount the team has gone over the cap (less the amount of payroll room the team had at the time the LTIR transaction took place), not the entire amount of the injured player's salary.""   http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11058/1128133-61.stm  A couple of paragraphs from the article: ""But there's a quirky little wrinkle in the NHL's collective bargaining agreement that shouldn't be forgotten, even though it's highly unlikely the Penguins will seriously consider trying to exploit it.  Shero was able to make the Neal-Niskanen trade because Evgeni Malkin is on the long-term injured list, and his $8.7 million salary-cap hit is off their books. Remember that Sidney Crosby, who has missed nearly two months because of a concussion, is on the LTI, too, which means the Penguins could bring in people to replace his cap hit, as well.  And this is where it could get interesting: The salary cap is not in effect during the playoffs, which means that, in theory, Shero could add players by using Crosby's cap space, but still be allowed to use Crosby in the playoffs without removing anyone from the roster to get down to the $59.4 million cap ceiling."""

630682,Rizzo,2011-10-14 01:39:00,4754,"refers to a debate we had a few months back when the Leafs signed him. Some of us felt he was too injury prone, others felt he had an unfair label as fragile"
630683,misfish,2011-10-14 01:42:00,29133,"Sry,thought you said Tim Conway."
630684,mercman,2011-10-14 01:43:00,7054,  Me too
630685,Rizzo,2011-10-14 01:43:00,4754,right now I'd take Dorf on Leafs over Connolly
630686,motion,2011-10-14 01:45:00,403,I think the Leafs signed him too!
630687,Rod Caster,2011-10-14 01:46:00,5784,"Yup, I defended him. Win some, lose some."
630688,Rizzo,2011-10-14 01:48:00,4754,"haha don't give up yet rod caster, I'm truly hoping he makes me eat these words, its still early."
630697,Rod Caster,2011-10-14 02:11:00,5784,I'm a PHX/Jets fan... I'm used to disapointment and loss. Hahaha I still remember when Buf was at the top of their conference a few years ago and Connolly was a key player on that team. Looks like he might not have a chance to prove himself this year... But here's hoping he can get healthy.
630701,kickingfrog,2011-10-14 02:39:00,8333,"Some else on the board used a statement a few weeks ago that seems appropriate in this case.  Don't know if this is verbatim but the gist was.  ""That's like shooting rats at the dump and then bragging about it'"""
630702,Paulus,2011-10-14 02:47:00,522,"I'm with you on him being injury prone and wishing we were watching him play (instead of reading articles about his injury being worse than they thought).  A couple of things to remember about Connolly though:a - he's better than Bozak even if he only plays 60 or so games and b - he was the best that was left in the free agent pool when they signed him.  I'd personally rather see the Leafs pay him what he's getting now, for two years, instead of the huge contract that the Rangers gave to Richards.  Plus it's not like Connolly's breaking the bank or part of the Leafs long term plans. And with him around, even when he's not playing, it does take a little bit of the pressure off Bozak - who knows, maybe that'll be good for the kid.  p.-"
630707,Miracon,2011-10-14 03:29:00,200," I thought so too! Loved him!  ""Lonely...Weenie!"""
630714,Billy Bob,2011-10-14 09:15:00,5865,I believe most fans in Buffalo loved Connolly at first but then loved him again when he signed with Toronto. He's the most talented hockey player in any hospital...
630724,solopaddler,2011-10-14 11:03:00,8605,"  Nice spin Paul, but it's still 4.5mil for 2 years against the cap for what?  I disliked him in Buffalo and was appalled when Burke signed him. And no I don't believe he's currently any better than Bozak.  If Connolly was the best option available to Burke last summer he should have passed.  Here's hoping Lombardi stays healthy."
630731,kickingfrog,2011-10-14 12:00:00,8333,"I believe the cap hit is only if/when he is on the 23 man roster. If that is the case, I would think that is way the leafs were willing to give him a contract when many other teams were not."
630738,blaque,2011-10-14 12:34:00,2419,"Buffalo has/had the tendancy to hang on to guys way too long. Gave them way to much time to come into their own, or back into their own upon their return if they were injured for a long period of time. Connolly sure was part of this Buffalo trend. Cant say Buffalo didnt try with him thats for sure. Im glad he is the Leafs problem now. Dont get me wrong, Im actually rooting for the guy.......theirs alot of talent in there and i hate to see that go to waste.  Jochen Hecht is the next Buffalo experiment that i wish would go to someone else."
630739,solopaddler,2011-10-14 12:35:00,8605," Nope, his salary still counts against the cap whether injured or playing."
630741,K_F,2011-10-14 12:38:00,107,let the haters hate when were out of a playoff spot  the buds are undefeated and the flames popped 4 on price last night- life is good last time i checked  id say we need to wait a little longer than 2 games....then make judgements

630874,Paulus,2011-10-14 18:19:00,522," As usual, you always have a good argument  But it's a cap hit on something better than what the Leafs had before, for about 60 games a year. Is there a better scenario? for sure, and that's why you go with only 2 years. Sorry, but you do get a guy who's better than Bozak, and you get depth: I don't think you can go wrong with depth.  And the byproduct of having Connolly as the #1 is that there is less pressure on Bozak, which is great since pressure is usually what causes a lot of these kids to crack.  No argument whatsoever regarding Lombardi. Better forward. Lower price.  p.-"
