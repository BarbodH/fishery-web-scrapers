She lives in Tampa and gets pissed off at me when I refer to it as gator bait. Women just have no sense of humor.  By the way, the Pomeranian has a storied military history. In 1807 the during the siege of Kolberg, the Germans sent wave upon wave of snarling little orange dogs out of the city to attack the French and piddle on Napoleon's boots. ;-)"

But i bet none of us really mean what we say.Thats what makes it HUMOR.The ad is humorous for sure,no question about that,but definately not something i ,as a fisherman want to be associated with, to a non-fisher,or a child. So let me finish with this, My panties are not in a knot,i wear briefs  I'm not even that upset about the ad.I can roll with the punches, and be as crazy or even crazier than anyone on this board.I can take a joke, and i can dish em out just as fast, and when i'm wrong i will look you in the eyes and apologize sincerely from the heart. It is MY opinion that the company shows poor taste in the use of a house pet of anykind, as a symbolic musky bait. We who have dogs, cats, rabbits and yes, even guinea pigs, love our pets dearly, and would never want them hurt in any way.Its MY opinion that any kind of lure would have gotten the point across just as well as the dog. When i first glanced at it, i didnt even know what they were selling.I have no doubt that St Croix rods are among the best on the market, but there are better out there, and they are the rods that I will use in the future.MY choice. This is MY Opinion which i felt compelled to share with you.Sorry, it wont happen again on this subject at least, i garantee it. Thank God, J.Bass is in hibernation.I'm sure his scatheing comments would have embarrassed me more than i already am."

531215,scuro2,2010-12-23 03:55:00,904,"Best fishing story I ever heard, and it was probably true, involved an elderly polish immigrant, a squirrel, a plank, and a truck. He wanted to catch a muskie and he saw one take down a duckling so he improvised and came up with his own method to catch a pike.  He attached a giant hook onto a live squirrel by wrapping enough rope around the squirrel and the shank of the hook so that hook would stay in place. He had about two hundred ft of rope and he attached that to the back of the truck and the hook on the other end. Next he attached a second rope onto a plank, put the squirrel on the plank and let the river current take the plank and squirrel out into the middle of the river. When he got it out far enough he yanked out the plank from underneath of the squirrel and pulled it in fast so it wouldn't tangle with the main line. The squirrel started thrashing and sure enough a muskie hit it, at which point he backed up the truck until the muskie was on shore. The squirrel did not survive."
531226,John Bacon,2010-12-23 05:17:00,3277, Sounds fishy to me.
531227,adempsey,2010-12-23 05:56:00,1498,"I have no opinion either way.   I just want to say you should still feel OK about being offended by it and not waiver just because most people aren't.  Although, I would have thought St.Croix would have come up with something less gimmicky for marketing their products than that."
531246,solopaddler,2010-12-23 11:51:00,8605," That's a good story indeed, but definitely false.  As I can attest to squirrels can swim.  The following is a true story that happened to me a few years back.  Several years ago while soloing in Quetico I approached a perfect island campsite on Kawnipi Lake and decided to pull in and set up camp as it was getting late.  While unloading my gear this angry little psycho red squirrel with a black slash on his forehead raced around me excitedly, chattering and shrieking like he was rabid (obviously I was on his turf!).  Anyhow, after awhile he left and I went about my business. A little while later I had a fire going and was about to start eating a potful of rice when out of the corner of my eye I spotted the little demon seed sitting on the log next to me mesmerised by my rice.  Very very slowly I grabbed the pot lid in my right hand and held it poised above the pot which was resting on my knees. It took a looong time, probably 15mins of sitting motionless like that, but finally the little buggar hopped into my pot and started gobbling up my rice.  I slammed the lid down to capture the demon and all hell broke loose! He was scrabbling at the pot trying to get out all the while making these weird gurgling noises LOL!  Well, as much as he was bugging me I didn't want to kill him, I just wanted him gone.  I looked around and noticed a tiny rockpile in the lake about 400yds from the island. Aha! I thought, Alcatraz it is for the little beggar!  I put the still shrieking squirrel into my canoe and pushed off for the rockpile.  Upon arriving, I VERY carefully placed the pot on the rocks, then leaned way over with the paddle, completely unbalanced, and flipped the pot lid off with the tip of the paddle.  What happened next is kind of a blur it happened so fast. In my minds eye I see the squirrel shoot straight up in the air about 3 feet, do a 360 to see where he is, then shrieking, he launched himself horizontally right at my face LOL! He was like the Chuck Norris of squirrels.  All 4 of the demons little claws sank into my face drawing blood. I freaked (obviously  ) and capsized my canoe into the lake.  The demon squirrel springboarded off my face and hit the water like he had an outboard in his butt making a beeline back to his island.  Squirrels are REALLY good swimmers, who knew? All I could do was laugh, I mean what else could I do?. I gathered my wits (and canoe) and made my way back to the island. Thankfully the demon squirrel seemed to be in hiding, the ordeal was over! (or so I thought!)  The next morning I packed up early as I wanted to get going. The canoe was loaded and I was just finishing my morning oatmeal when, you guessed it, I spied the demon squirrel about 2 feet to my right staring intently at my pot of oatmeal!  I knew it was the same beast 'cause of the distinctive black slash on his forehead (sign of the beast?)  Anyhow, this time it took at least 1/2 an hour...my arm was getting REALLY tired holding my pot lid in the air motionless.  Finally, his hunger overcame his fear and he tentatively hopped in. I slammed the lid down on him with a vengeance!.  Man the bizarre, otherworldly noises that came from that pot sent chills down my spine!  Without really thinking, just reacting, I grabbed the pot and started to shake it as hard as I could (sorry squirell lovers, don't condemn me 'till you've walked a mile in my shoes  ).  I shook that pot 'till my arms were sore then threw it down on the ground. Amazingly the demon landed on his feet, standing upright. His eyes were closed though, and he was wobbling around like a drunk.  I grabbed my pot, thinking, huh, that'll teach ya!. I was still watching the beast as I turned to my canoe, when suddenly the wobbling stopped, his beady eyes snapped open clear and bright and full of hate!  He let out a blood curdling shriek and launched himself at my leg!  If any of you remember the killer bunny rabbit from Monty Python and The Holy Grail, well this was pretty similar.  Frantically I tried to get to my canoe and safety as the creature attacked. He latched himself onto the cuff of my pants as I ran to my boat. Realising he was attached to me I kicked my leg out and he flew off (I could have split the uprights at 60yds with that shot). Anyhow, I made it to my boat and pushed off, finally escaping the beasts wrath.  By far my most memorable wildlife encounter!     Merry Christmas"

Of course they were outraged and we had them hooked big time when we got Kevin in on the act by having him send an e-mail to us  indicating he would arrange for the ducklings to be available upon our arrival.  This went on for a couple weeks, and I knew my wife was very disturbed by this because she would bring it up at the oddest times. ""Is it legal?"" ""Don't you feel badly?"" ""How do the harnesses work""?, and on and on. My buddy and I work together and every day we'd get together and share our wive's questions and indignation over coffee. At some point I went down to the pet shop and bought the smallest pet harness I could find, brought it home, tied on a couple monster hooks, and laid it on the kitchen table. My wife came home,looked at it and announced she wasn't going if I was going to kill a baby duck just to catch a fish. So I told her the ducks don't always die, especially if you don't cast them. Just set them in the  water and let them swim around. At some point I knew she was really getting upset so I came clean. Then there is a period of a couple hours where I don't remember much. We still joke about that one."

We have all seen or heard horrible stories of this kind of thing happening in real life, so you would think that St.Croix would be a little more sensitive about this.  The disclaimer in very fine print states the following 'No animals were harmed in the making of this ad, and st croix company in no way endorses or suggests the use of live poodles as musky bait(besides, who'd want to spend a day in the boat with one)  Give me a break !!! I hope the spca jumps all over their  about this.  Thats all  thanks"

530637,Burtess,2010-12-21 20:19:00,901,The only thing that peeves me off about that ad is they should have used a yappier dog like a shih tzu or a bichon frise......  Burt
530642,Terry,2010-12-21 20:26:00,14456,"what colour was the bait I mean dog   it is a standard joke about the dog for bait  and it this day of political correctness, I insult someone almost ever time I speak  even if I am the only one in the room"
530643,BUSTER,2010-12-21 20:27:00,1336,I'am sure if it was a Cat you'd have on issue with it  they make great muskie bait i hear.  ....well ! thats what i heard i also heard its hard to get them 3 feet below the surface too.    those are your comments mercman.....
530644,blaque,2010-12-21 20:27:00,2419,Is there a zipped lip emoticon?
530645,solopaddler,2010-12-21 20:35:00,8605,"That ad's been around for a while, it's great.  It makes me want to buy a St. Croix."
530646,SmokestackLightnin,2010-12-21 20:38:00,390,"It's a joke and it's kinda funny, see for yourself:  https://www.causewaybaitandtackle.com/popuplargeimage.asp?strImage=1830.jpg&strImageType=product&strPageTitle=St. Croix Poodle Poster  There is a space in the link so you may have to copy and paste it into a browser."
530647,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-21 20:42:00,2690,"  Okay, it did make me laugh...should have used a cat, though!!"
530648,mercman,2010-12-21 20:50:00,7054,"I fully agree with you all who find it funny. It is kinda funny.And i have no problem with joking about it with you guys and bantering back and forth about it.The rant is about them using it on the back of a magazine featuring stories about fishing for musky, to sell thier rods. Most of us know each other enough to know that when we joke about something, its just that.Its not necessarilly the way we trully feel.At least thats they way i approach the type of humor i have seen here. Now that its been mentioned, i may have posted a bit differently  if it had been a cat, who knows.    "
530650,Harrison,2010-12-21 20:54:00,2202,"Humour has many tastes.  Persoanlly, I think it is a great ad.  Some people don't like or get the movie Napoleon Dynomite, I can't get through the first 3 mins without busting a gut."
530653,cram,2010-12-21 20:59:00,1733,Its on the back of EVERY musky hunter magazine.  Personally I think its a great ad and is clearly a joke.   Hardly a dog with a hook through it.   If you're offended by this you probably need to lighten up.
530654,solopaddler,2010-12-21 21:01:00,8605," Nope, that's the way I really feel."
530655,tb4me,2010-12-21 21:02:00,3295,i too thought it was funny.
530658,Lunker Larry,2010-12-21 21:05:00,122,"That advertisement has been out for years. The first one was just a white poodle. They followed that up with a firetiger sweater on it. Personnaly I loved it and, being a muskie fisherman, had it hanging in my office for years. Mind you, some of the women weren't too fond of it, but it didn't offend anyone."
530666,walleyejack,2010-12-21 21:26:00,358,"Where can i get a dog like that, I think i have a shirt that will fit him !"
530667,lew,2010-12-21 21:27:00,12766,"I never thought anyone would actually take offense with that ad and as has been mentioned already, it's been around for a long time. I've even used that picture on this board several times over the years when we've been joking about musky baits and one of our members even used it as his avatar picture for quite awhile.  It's just a bit of humor, nuthin more."
530670,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-21 21:36:00,3761,"I have a mag with that ad on the back, thought it was good...have you seen the shirts with that on it?? Maybe I should buy one for you."
530674,mercman,2010-12-21 21:47:00,7054,you are right it is funny. i have never seen it before because i have never had a subscription to a fishing mag.I guess i haven't been exposed to this type of advertising as often as some of you. i guess there arent many poodle lovers in this crowd either.  
530677,Gregoire,2010-12-21 21:49:00,1397,That ad is the reason why my girlfriend won't let me take out dog fishing. I think it's funny. She does not.
530681,mercman,2010-12-21 21:52:00,7054,"  sigh......you too eh ?  My wife freaked when she saw it, and the only way to calm her down was post this stupid rant thing in here.dumbest thing i've done in a long time"
530682,Bill Shearer,2010-12-21 21:55:00,456,"Mercman At the end of the day, you really have to laugh at the ad! I'm a dog guy,and I'm not offended at all! Of course my dog is a Lab! Much bigger than those yappy little balls of fur! I fished a St.Croix rod for about 20 minutes once, but in spite of that, they have a good product, with a great guarantee. Give them a break.  We need to relax about this type of thing. Political correctness is contagious! And that's my thoughts."
530683,jedimaster,2010-12-21 21:56:00,3472,poodles eh? I always thought people used guinie pigs?
530692,esoxansteel,2010-12-21 22:28:00,1307,"A great add, and a smart business move, they should change the add to nothin throws a Taliban like a St Croix and have a 10/0 mustad coming out of their"
