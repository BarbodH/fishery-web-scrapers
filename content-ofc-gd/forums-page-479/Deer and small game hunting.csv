So I have no where to hunt. So was wondering if anyone around the Barrie area had a spot I could bow hunt for deer and if also possible small game with small calibre.  Or does anyone want to team up with me.  Respect for land has always been my goal and sharing of game is also important.  If you have any opportunities please let me know and we can get in contact  Thank you"
