630132,skinny,2011-10-12 16:14:00,442,I was talking to a friend of my Dads he is from Texas. He was saying they use a under water green light to fish with. They go out at night to fish rather than during the day due to the heat. He says the green light is just off bottom and attracts small fish that attract the bigger ones.  I'm just wondering if these methods are legal in Ontario as I always thought fishing with a light directly on the water was wrong
630145,hammercarp,2011-10-12 17:01:00,964,"Page 8 of the regulation summary.  It is illegal to: Use artificial lights to attract fish except: – to fish for smelt, or to fish for lake whitefish or lake herring with a dip net – if the light is part of a lure attached to a line used in angling.  So it's illegal to do what your friend does, here. Here's some fishing trivia. In Texas you can use up 100 hooks and shoot cormorants."

630166,tb4me,2011-10-12 18:43:00,3295,Im sure your ok Bill. I see night fishermen use launterns all the time while walleye fishing at night. I think its ok as long as your not using it in or on the water..
630264,skinny,2011-10-12 22:32:00,442,I saw a boat with bright green Led's down the side like navigation lights I'm sure it helped out
630304,OutdoorDan,2011-10-12 23:21:00,325,"Lanterns that you use to illuminate the immediate area around you are fine, the intention of the law is to prevent people from hanging lights outside of their boats/very edge of the dock for the purpose of attracting fish."
