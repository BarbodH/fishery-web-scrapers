I did'nt catch on right away what was going on til i felt my skin getting wet and reached back to feel a dam tail sticking out my pocket and him roaring his head off , you know you just can't pull a fish out of your hip pocket when its in there head first , its not that easy , when he saw me getting a bit ticked when i was'nt able to pull it out with my hands he offered to help and pulled his plyers out of the tackle box and gave it a pull till i stoped him , the dam points on the back fin stuck right in to the skin . Well theres only one way to take it out if you ever have it happen and thats drop your pants . With him being a bit nevus while out in big water and not likeing it i gave him a good ride back to the launch and i had the last laugh listning to him beg for me to slow down and stop jumping the wakes . Dam kid brothers ."
