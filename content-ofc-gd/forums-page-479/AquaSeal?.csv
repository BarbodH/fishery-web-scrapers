630795,GBW,2011-10-14 15:34:00,8460,Did you try The Fishin' Hole?

630803,DRIFTER_016,2011-10-14 15:47:00,10439, Go to Canadian Tire and buy a tube of Shoe Goo if you can't find any Aquaseal locally.
630816,Paulus,2011-10-14 16:09:00,522,"I usually order mine online at Mountain Equipment Coop. They are not usually on back order. Plus, MEC has tons of other stuff, like Gore-tex patches, that can come in handy.  p.-"

630836,cuzza,2011-10-14 16:55:00,467,First Cast/Hook Line and Sinker (same shop) in Guelph will almost certainly have some  Give 'em a call - http://www.hooklineandsinker.ca/

630839,jrego7,2011-10-14 17:07:00,37,Thank you all for taking the time to answer my question and posting links. Appreciate it! So many places to choose from now
630849,cjgraham,2011-10-14 17:24:00,104,Try a local scuba diving store thats where I get mine
630859,Fisherman,2011-10-14 17:42:00,7201,"I think some guys here are thinking you have a hole(s) in your boots or are you trying to water proof them?  Nik wax is another excellent product, I do my work boots twice a year, keeps the leather supple and waterproof.  I get mine at Sojourn in Barrie, MEC might also carry it."
630887,jrego7,2011-10-14 18:58:00,37,"A pair of steel toe rubber boots suffered a small crack near the steel toe. Sad to see, was the best pair of boots I've owned. I would have never guessed that they would crack before me being an idiot and stepping near a nail putting it through the side on accident. I also bought a new pair of Terra work boots that I would like to seal and make them more resistant to water. I hate working all day outside with wet feet and try to avoid wearing rubber boots when possible. Another option I thought about buying is a neoprene boot liner, but a no leak solution sounds better."
630917,GBW,2011-10-14 20:33:00,8460,"Oh man, shoe-goo will fix your current boot no prob!  As for the new boots, there are some good sealants out there too to spray on a few coats and you are good to go.  just reapply more the more often you wear them."
630953,Sinker,2011-10-14 21:46:00,8692,"Go to canadian tire and get a tube of GOOP. The marine stuff will seal anything you have, including a boat. Its awesome stuff, I love it!!  S."
