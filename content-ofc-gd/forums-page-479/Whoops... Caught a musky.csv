629356,mike rousseau,2011-10-10 12:47:00,4661,Was doing some night trolling with my brother for walleye when this nice musky grabbed his 3-4 inch crank...  No tape on it cause I didn't have my musky gear...  But she was big... Not 50 inches but not far off... I guessed at 48

629360,mike rousseau,2011-10-10 13:09:00,4661, Yup...  Almost spooled him... We had to chase it with the boat...
629362,mercman,2011-10-10 13:17:00,7054,  Awesome Should send that pic to them.Maybe get some freebies
629363,ccmtcanada,2011-10-10 13:23:00,7971,I did an oops to yesterday fishing for walleye too!  Your fish was much bigger though!!
629367,lew,2011-10-10 13:41:00,12766,Nothing gets the ole ticker fired up quite as much as night time muskies !!  Goodun Mike !!
629373,SlowPoke,2011-10-10 14:22:00,2984,"Where was the walleye you were targeting, inside the muskie? Very nice fish!"
629377,Rich Clemens,2011-10-10 14:34:00,3131,Sometimes an accident is a good thing.
629379,mike rousseau,2011-10-10 14:44:00,4661,  We let them go last night...  But we didn't get any where we got the musky... For obvious reasons...
629390,Joey,2011-10-10 15:36:00,9122,"Well that's the nicest ""Oops"" I've ever seen!!  Well Done!"

629474,GBW,2011-10-10 23:01:00,8460,"sounds like me on Sat.  12LB nanofil on my med action jigging rod right as it got dark.  I'll post a report rather then say more here.  Nice ""ooops""!!!"
629562,Handlebarz,2011-10-11 01:24:00,3790,Very nice Mike I hope it was from a area you don't target musky so it gave you a new place to look for them.
629566,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 01:37:00,4661, Kinda...  A new spot on the spot if you will...
629569,adolson,2011-10-11 01:46:00,783,"Wow, congrats to him on landing that on 10lb PP!"
629620,spincast,2011-10-11 09:21:00,3279,sweet fish - that would be a blast bringing in on a walleye setup- well done on keeping it on
629703,Jigs,2011-10-11 14:31:00,136,I had a couple oops too this weekend but they didn't end so well.  I got bit off twice! Hey he didn't have my lures did he by any chance?   Nice fish!
