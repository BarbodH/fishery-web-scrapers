630628,lew,2011-10-13 22:13:00,12766,This fella is a good guy to fish with so you may want to give him a try.  My picture is on his website but I have no affiliation with his company and have never hired him as a guide.  We used to fish together but just as friends and he's a good musky fisherman.  http://kawarthafishing.com/
