629895,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 23:29:00,5784,"I just want to comment on how great the reports have been lately. I haven't seen this many nice weather/nice fish/family reports in a long time! The Musky reports have been especially epic lately! I'm looking forward to the fall BOQ and other walleye factory (Musky Mike, Limeyangler and others) reports.  OFC is pure gold sometimes; the past few days have proven that!!"
