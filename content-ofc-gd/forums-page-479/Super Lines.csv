630397,Skipper D,2011-10-13 02:27:00,1970,"  I don't seem to have any trouble with it tho , i never asked what others are useing that are in the boat but its always unanamis after words that i out fished every one that day in the boat , you mention sensitivity , could it be that its the rod that dose that part and not the line ?"
630398,OutdoorDan,2011-10-13 02:30:00,325,Yes of course the rod is important as well.  Again though I only fish for perch in the winter and thinner line just lets you know more about what is going on down there with a small bait.  Plus if you get something big on it's going to be a rush!
630400,Skipper D,2011-10-13 02:37:00,1970,"Sorry there i forgot the smaller baits , up til now i am still using worms on a perch set up ."

There will be no ice fishing for me , starting the first of November til the end of March here our days and nights get reversed , sleep in the day and work the nights .

630463,dwc67,2011-10-13 12:00:00,140,"i use fireline crystal in 4lb for deep erie perch. it's so thin you can scale down on the weight and it will transmit a goby nibble in 65ft. watch for fraying around the knot after an hour or so of catching. best of all for you, you just need a gentle sweep to set the hook."

I myself am an old time mono guy but I think the nonstretch and sensitivity of the super line may be to your advantage presenting baits to those deep water perch."
630517,Headhunter,2011-10-13 15:26:00,5703,"Hey BB,  Just buy a spool of 4lb Floro and be done with it! I'm a mono guy as well and have developed a real fondness for this line. Yes, it is expensive, but it will outlast  a normal mono line. Virtually no line stretch, invisible once in the water and holds up to cold temps very well. Also, it is very much abrasion resistant, so the Erie zebra's won't cause you grief at all. I have been using floro for a few years now and it has held up very well, from summer fishing all the way to -35 up at Temagami (Which has no fish of course!) HH"
630792,snowdown,2011-10-14 15:21:00,24,i only use powerpro.
630808,BillM,2011-10-14 15:55:00,17367,"The line twist flouro is famous for drives me crazy.  I spooled up with it once, never again.  If I'm jigging whities and lakers in 100ft of water, 4lb-6lb Fireline Crystal with a 24-36inch flouro leader.  For perch in the shallower stuff I find the Berkley Ice line works pretty good (The blue stuff).."
630866,Ron,2011-10-14 18:10:00,1683," No special knots required. I use a uni - uni or the triple surgeon for joining braid to floro. You can use the palomar or improved cinch on the business end.  High lb test lines 65 or more, a friend of mine, (lets just call him 36"" BOB) has shown me a knot system for joining braid to your leaders. Take and form a 12"" loop with your braid, do the double or triple surgeons knot. To connect your leader to your main line simply pull your braid through the loop of your leader and pass it back over. (It would look like a palomar knot when finished.) Easy to change leaders when needed and the surgeon knot will actually catch the floating weed as opposed to fouling your lure.... sometimes.  Cheers, Ron..."

After looking at Cabela's site, my head is spinning...the only Super line I use is Power Pro on my Dipsy rods as I like mono.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/browse/fishing-fishing-line-super-lines/_/N-1100386/Ns-CATEGORY_SEQ_104612580?WTz_l=SBC%253BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104719680"

630188,bare foot wader,2011-10-12 19:26:00,1354,"I've been a fan of power pro since it first came out, run it almost every rod now, from 8 lb up to 130  just spooled up some 832 and too soon to tell but it seems pretty damn good, better than power pro...slightly more durable and better casting  use fireline on some ice fishing reels because I think it holds less water/subsequently ice than power pro but frays easier, more like floss, not as round as 832 or PP, bunches on the spool easily if you don't stay on top of it  have used tuff duracast and hated it, frays easily and didn't sit good on the spool  you can't go wrong with power pro or 832...I use 8lb on a light action rod, works great jigging  haven't found that new berkley nano stuff yet but that might be good for you as well"
630191,DOS,2011-10-12 19:53:00,119,"Check out Berkley Nanofil (sp?) the 4lb is the thinest line I have ever seen, 0 stretch, cant wait to try it  on the perch this winter.  RED"
630193,mercman,2011-10-12 19:57:00,7054,"For what you need Bob, try Nanaofil.I like its strength, but not the spool memory it seems to exhibit. Its strong like braid, but very smooth and easy to retrieve. For perching, the spool memory shouldnt affect you at all, but i dont like it for casting even though it comes off the spool effortlessly.When the line is slack, it sits there curled up on the water.Thats my experience with it.  "
630217,fish_fishburn,2011-10-12 21:22:00,1311,"832 is the cats meow... Double up the strength of your bifocals cause man, that 10 lb is skinny."
630224,GBW,2011-10-12 21:40:00,8460,the nanofil is a good line but I'm sticking with my spider-wire when it comes to light braid.
630237,Roy,2011-10-12 22:01:00,13728,"Bob, if there were 1,000 line brands you'd get 1,000 suggestions on this thread. Here's my suggestion. You seem to favour brand loyalty in your purchases (Fish Eagle II)...you're already using PowerPro for other applications and you like the stuff. Go to your friendly neighbourhood tackle shop and get yourself  some of this. It's available in 5, 8, 10 and 15lb test. You'll be glad you did and again, there's something to be said for brand loyalty."
630252,registerfly,2011-10-12 22:18:00,198,the new PP they are selling now I find is not as good as the last one.  but yeah PP
630278,adempsey,2011-10-12 22:56:00,1498,"Whatever is on sale.   I use PowerPro, Sufix 832 and Fireline.   My brother likes Spiderwire Braid."
630340,OutdoorDan,2011-10-13 00:51:00,325,If I'm using braid it's PP -- from the 50lb I use on the dipsy rods to the lighter 10/15lb on my jigging rods.  On a separate note since this doesn't deserve it's own thread: I'd like to start using braid for ice fishing applications particularly when I am fishing deep water.  Anyone have experience with nanofil in these situations?  I took a look at it today and judging by the texture it shouldn't hold water and freeze up.  Anyone have experience with it?
630344,manitoubass2,2011-10-13 00:58:00,11391," I used it(Naniofil) for a small part of last season. I'll be testing it more this season as well (as I think the product I received wasn't a production ready version?)  I didn't mind it, but it wasn't amazing either. It did coil for me quite abit, and it still froze, but it took longer and was of less extent then other lines, which is a good thing. After my firs spool of use, my initial thought was ""maybe a line this thin is actually too thin?"" It seemed almost ""slippery"" off the reel, which was of some annoyance in certain cold weather situations.  I'm still open minded though, and I'd like to try it for some other applications more thoroughly.  oh, and man is it white, like snowblind white, lol"
630348,OutdoorDan,2011-10-13 01:05:00,325,"Thanks, manitou.  Yes, the colour is going to be ridiculous for seeing against the ice...I didn't realize it was the only colour they produced, but I just checked their website and the only colour is ""crystal white"" as they call it."
630353,adolson,2011-10-13 01:09:00,783,"I, too, am a mono fan, but this year I've used PowerPro, Fireline Fused Crystal, and Tuf-Line Duracast, as far as super lines go. So far, I've preferred the Duracast. I was using the green 12lb line (diameter was about the same as 6lb mono I guess), and I still caught three small brook trout with it (and lost others). It's smooth like mono, so it doesn't make the noise that PowerPro does going through the metal guides on my rod and it doesn't lose its color. Quantitatively, I didn't have as many issues with memory or wind knots or fraying as I did with other lines (including monos like Suffix Elite), but I'm now casting to the end of my spool so it's time to get a new line. I am going to keep trying other stuff, but so far I've liked it. It feels and acts somewhere in between mono and braid, I find. I'm sure there's someone here who has some horror story about it, though. (Edit: I just glanced back over the thread and yeah, someone already posted they don't like it. )  I need to respool before the weekend trip to go for trout (weather permitting), and I'm not sure if I'll just put 4lb Trilene XL on there for that, or try out something new like NanoFil, Suffix 832, Fireline Fused Original, or Spiderwire."
630362,manitoubass2,2011-10-13 01:26:00,11391," No problem. I should also mention the ""new knot"" is abit of a hinderance, but not of any real issue after a few ties. If I remember correctly, I used a 4lb version, and some of the issues I had may be corrected by simply using a larger diameter.  Dana, those metal eyes are generally referred to as ""guides"", lol, but we got ya  My apologies if you were talking about that ""look"" the girls give Eddie Vedder at a  concert"
630365,adolson,2011-10-13 01:30:00,783," HAHA, yeah, I knew that. I don't know why I wrote eyes."

630370,GBW,2011-10-13 01:44:00,8460,"Dana, try spiderwire in moss green.  it's round and casts well."
630375,Ron,2011-10-13 01:50:00,1683,"I have had the opportunity to try out some of the NEW ""Super Slick"" made by Power Pro. I gotta tell ya, I was very impressed with the stuff. I am trying the 15 lb for walleye and smallies. Thinner diameter than regular PP and very very very quiet through the guides. I am ordering a 1500 spool of hi vis yellow to spool all my reels with.  You won't be disappointed with the 6lb for perching.  Cheers, Ron..."
630379,Roy,2011-10-13 01:56:00,13728," I'm already a PowerPro user Ron but I was looking at their slick line and was going to wait until enough people had used it to get a good feel for the line's quality or lack of but with this testimonial coming from you, I'll stock up. Thanks."
630380,adolson,2011-10-13 01:57:00,783," Prodigy? Hahah, hardly. I fished a lot from ages 5-15... I just didn't know rules or proper presentation. Mostly did what the adults were doing.   Hmm, cool. I'll see if it's at the shop when I go and give it a try.   This Super Slick PP also sounds good to me, too. I'll add it to my own list to try out."
630386,Skipper D,2011-10-13 02:07:00,1970,"Are we just talking about whats the best thing ""line and rod"" for fishing perch Bob ? Because i fear i could'nt handle losing a fish due to a snaped line , i use trilene 10 pound test on all my rods , i know its sounds crazy but its been works for me so far and i like to belive i have it all covered because you never know whats going to get on down there . For hooking perch i use a 6""6"" medium action rod , if i don't want tocome home after a long day of non stop perch action with sore sholders i taught myself to just pull off to the side lightly , and so far so good but what do i know .  "
630389,OutdoorDan,2011-10-13 02:11:00,325,"Skipper,  10lb for perch can get really annoying if you are using smaller baits because you lose sensitivity.  Also in the context of ice fishing lighter baits go down faster with thinner line."
630390,manitoubass2,2011-10-13 02:13:00,11391,"  Of course. But I find it enjoyable to see how fast you are advancing, thus my enthusiasm."
