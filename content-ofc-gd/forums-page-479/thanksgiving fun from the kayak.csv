629536,miller,2011-10-11 00:46:00,223,"after eating my turkey feast earlier in the afternoon i couldn't sit around at home i had to hit the water. tossed the gear in the car and the yak on the roof and off i went. started out on a good note getting one largie on a topwater. worked around a couple areas until i found a hotspot loaded with them. picked off quite a few on different cranks and spinners. decided to troll a crank along a shoreline and on the first pass i hooked into a jumbo perch which shook off at the side of the yak. second pass i hook into something big which starts peeling drag and ends up shaking the hooks too. third times a charm, i make another pass and bam rod hunches over and drag starts peeling out. after a solid fight and getting towed around i managed to get my first salmon from the yak and also realized i need a bigger net cause i couldnt get that thing in it. perfect day on the water capped off with some nice fish. happy thanks giving and enjoy the pics.

629921,miller,2011-10-12 00:10:00,223,"thanks guys, definatly a rush getting a salmon from the kayak. when i pulled the rod out of the holder and set the hook it spun me haha. the lake was like glass all day and i was hoping for maybe a pike or trout on the troll back but i was definatly quite pleased when it turned out to be a salmon."
629933,spincast,2011-10-12 00:34:00,3279,"nice going   pretty sure I saw another one of those, or maybe even that one, jumping in the harbour on Saturday.  Came right out of the water in front of 4 guys fishing for bass. The look on the one guys face  was priceless"
