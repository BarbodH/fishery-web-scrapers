2499,Rizzo,2006-11-20 02:34:00,4754,that will make the next time out all the more sweet
2500,silvio,2006-11-20 02:35:00,433,cc I hit 2 fish today I was also going to get skunked when I decided to try one last spot the pool holding the most fish was full with snagers I decided to go for a walk hit 2 nice 7 + pound bows in a small pool. I was also east. I didn’t have a cell so I didn’t report them but they said they were going to be there again next week at 6:30 all be calling the mnr and notifying them. These guys had 7 bows 3 over 10 pounds and 2 female browns I tried by casting my line over there and hawging the pool but it didn’t work. I was called an idiot for putting my line on there’s when they had fish its funny to see grown men call 14 year old an idiot because he actually cares about the future of steelheading. I hope theses guys get busted next weekend.
