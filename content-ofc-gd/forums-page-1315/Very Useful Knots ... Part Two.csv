Draw knots as tight as possible. 4. Trim tag ends close to the knot. =====================================================================   Egg Loop The Egg Loop was one of our most requested knots - so here it is. Steelheaders and salmon fishermen rely on this knot to attach a cluster of eggs or yarn to a hook. It works best with hooks that have turned-up or turned-down eyes.   Float Stop The float fisherman uses a running float for casting and general handiness, and stops the float from running up the line by using the Float Stop. It has the advantage that the stops moves readily over the rod guides, but grips the monofilament nylon so tightly that it will not slide over the line.  It should be made with about 12.5cm of nylon, usually the same diameter as the line itself.  Take 2 turns (3 if necessary) around the main line at the chosen point. Bring both ends around to form a Surgeon's Knot. Tighten into shape bringing the coils close together.   Hangman's Knot There are at least 6 variations of the Hangman's Knot, - all of them excellent for terminal tackle, swivels and hooks. The ""standard"" Hangman's Knot holds only five turns when tied in monofilament nylon. If tied in rope, and used for its stated purpose, it takes eight turns.  Pass a 15cm loop of line through the eye. Bring the end back on itself, passing it under the doubled part. Make five loops over the doubled part. The formed knot is worked into shape. The knot is sent down the line, against the eye of the hook or swivel.   Improved Clinch Knot The Improved Clinch Knot is has become one of the most popular knots for tying terminal tackle connections. It is quick and easy to tie and is strong and reliable. The knot can be difficult to tie in lines in excess of 30 lb test. Five+ turns around the standing line is generally recommended, four can be used in heavy line. This not is not recommended with braided lines.   Jansik Special Knot Another beautifully simple knotthat can be tied in the dark, The Jansik Special is a high strength knot tied as follows:  Put 15cm of line through the eye of the hook. Bring it around in a circle and put the end through again. Making a second circle, pass then end through a third time. Holding the three circles of line against each other, wrap the end three times around the circles. Either hold the hook steady with pliers, or make it fast to boat's rigging or safety lines. Holding strain on the hook, pull on both ends of the line to tighten.   King Sling Knot "
