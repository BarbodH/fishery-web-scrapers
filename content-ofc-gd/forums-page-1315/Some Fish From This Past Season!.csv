2076,Rattletrap2,2006-11-19 05:03:00,1652,"I haven't posted too many pics lately, but here are some fish from my 2006 season. I mainly fish for Bass (Mostly Smallmouths this year), but one decent Pike thrown in as well.  Most of the time I fish alone, so no pictures of the Largemouths!       Thanks for taking a look!"
2111,Greencoachdog,2006-11-19 12:07:00,8163,"Those are some real nice smallies there RT  , but if it was really summer... wouldn't you have your shirt off? I'm thinkin' about writin' an instruction manual on how to take fishin' pic by yourself with the self timer feature on various cameras... would you be interested in buying a copy?"
2122,Smokey,2006-11-19 13:07:00,1278,"Healthy looking smallies, thanks for the great fish pics."
