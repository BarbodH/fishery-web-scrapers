We caught some nice trout and lost so nice ones My biggest trout waz 12 pounds and i got my very frst trout there so my curse is over i can land trout. and i lost a big old lake trout  That waz my biggest trout it took me 500 yards down stream and 15min to reel him in what a tank.    There is a nice pic of the river.    There is my big one that is the same fish as in the first pic man that fish waz born eating bait fish    There is a nice one my friend caught    That waz my very first trout i have ever caught my first drift at Deeny`s Dam he took me way down stream we never usually fish there but i had to try a drift because there waz not many people there    And there waz some lunch And my campsite those were the fish we keep it waz my first fish so i had to take it home and the second one my friend caught she had fought herself to death    here is a close up of them nice fish a    hope u enjoy looking at the pics  Sorry for showing dead fish  p.s those are just some of the fish we caught  jordan"
