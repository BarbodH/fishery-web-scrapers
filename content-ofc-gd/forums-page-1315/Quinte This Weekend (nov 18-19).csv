Waited too long, last minute, no space, all booked, ..... Guess I may have to sacrifice my body in the name of fishing and shack up with the local cougars if I can't get a floor spot. Ahhh, life is good in Canada....no ???  I'm waiting to hear back from blackfish88, so I'll have room for 1 or possibly 2 in the boat. Let me know if anyone needs a boat to fish in. Anyone want to fish with the best walleye guide in the world ? Well, he's probably busy, so you can fish with me instead.   By the way, I like the look of the new site. Nice job guys."
