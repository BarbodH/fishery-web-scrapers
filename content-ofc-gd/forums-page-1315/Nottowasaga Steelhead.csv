So I wanted to share my photos to show that there is still some good action on the Nottie....  Oct 10th Good day, got into three but only landed this one...   Oct 15th The only bow the entire day.   Nov 12th Again, got into three, but only one landed.   This past weekend, due to rain, the Nottie was chocolate milk.  Hopefully everything will be clearer this Thursday.....  All fish were caught using 6lb main and 4lb leader, and released.  Just seeing the float go under and the fight of a steelhead is enough...  Nick"
