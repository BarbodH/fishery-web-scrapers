Let's continue the planning/discussion of this fine event.  Last I recall we were aiming for the Tuesday Dec 26th (Cheap wings) or Friday Dec 29th (Reg. Price wings)  GMAN, did you handle the booking last year? I recall you mentioning something about knowing the owner there, maybe he can throw in some free wings or something for our repeat business?  Looking forward to this event. Tony"
1546,setomonkey,2006-11-17 23:16:00,872,"Tony,  Will this be at the Bronte firehouse like previous swills?  Mike"
1591,PatB,2006-11-18 00:51:00,104,"Mike it will be at the Firehall as always, we just have to find out what the best day is for everyone. Tuesday's are the cheapest 2 for 1, but this time of year shouldn't really matter. Monday to Sunday is good for me. ( execpt the 30th this year got the family thing up at Dave and Busters)"
2693,tonyb,2006-11-20 15:47:00,1637,"Yeah the Bronte Firehall seems to have pretty darned good wings, no need to change a good thing  Only 5 weeks until Christmas, holy crap!  Tony"
2698,setomonkey,2006-11-20 15:52:00,872,"So was a date picked, or is it still up in the air?  Friday is better for me than Tuesday, though I do respect the importance of cheap wings!  Mike"
2700,bpsbassman,2006-11-20 16:03:00,941,"Hey Tony, maybe the best thing would be to put up a poll with the available dates and let majority rule (or something like that it)."
2712,tonyb,2006-11-20 16:32:00,1637,"I was thinking about the poll thing, but you get people voting that don't even show up so it is hard to gauge it that way.  It would be better if people responded with a definate yes and what dates they could make it for.  That way we would be working towards trying to accomodate the most people that are actually going to show.  Tony"
2733,robin,2006-11-20 17:13:00,46,Friday I am in if its Tuesday I wont be able to make it I would suggest everyone just put when they can attend and what ever majority is make it that date.. I kinda like the idea of a poll as well... Most of the people who wont attend wont vote this is the OFC board its not like others Just my 2 cents Robin
2870,Handlebarz,2006-11-20 20:44:00,3790,Well the Friday would be best for me also the 26th is a write off as the wifes side of the family are coming over for dinner and I will be too drunk to get upther for the wings and back home again heck I hope the woife comes along this year.
