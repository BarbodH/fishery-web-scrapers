Brass weights and glass beads are preferred by professionals when they want to maximize attraction. The leader length from the swivel to the hook will vary as the fishing conditions. Typically, the leader length is 18""-24"". This technique is effective when fishing submerged weed beds and weed lines, it allows the bait to float above the weeds.   TEXAS RIG  The ‘Texas Rig’ is the main line threaded through a worm weight and tied directly to the hook. The free sliding of the weight allows the bait to fall with control.   SPLIT SHOT RIG  The ‘Split Shot Rig’ is used in conditions that require finesse techniques. Use the split shot, crimped onto the main line to determine line length between lead and the hook. This technique is very effective around timber or docks, the rate of fall is controlled. Finesse fishing allows the angler to keep the bait in the strike zone longer.   DROP SHOT RIG  The most popular rig of late, gaining popularity among weekend warriors and professionals alike.  The two weights shown are distinct in the type of terrain they should be fished in.  If the bottom has a lot of chunk rock and is quite variable, then the round ball is your choice. These weights will not slip between the rocks and get caught as easily as the finesse weights.  As far as the hook is concerned, the split-shot hook is the hook of choice. I use our New Eagleclaw Pro Series L7226BPD Drop Shot hook in a # 4 or # 6. Tying this type of hook directly to the mainline using 6 lb. Monofilament and a polymer knot with the hook point facing the rod tip is recommended. A trick when tying the knot is to feed the tag end back through the eye before attaching the weight. This simple application will keep the hook facing the surface reducing it chance to get hung up.  At this point all you have to do is tip a plastic worm or tube and cast it out. When retrieving this rigging technique, shake the rod tip and then reel until taut. The bite will be as much as a tick then a spongy feeling. Set the rod finishing with the rod tip high and then reduce your drag so that you do not over exert the line.  I would also recommend either a #1 or #2 Pro Series X-Wide Gap L7013BPG hook, or a #2 or #4 Split Shot Hook.   WACKY STYLE  Basically this type of presentation relies on the weight and shape of the plastic baits to determine the rate of fall and action. If you use a stiffer bait, like our SinkSlo, then the action will be a lengthy side to side. However, if you use our Tickle Worm, then the fall will be more like an undulation action (definitely more lifelike). There are so many baits to use but the best ones are skinny, soft and 4” or longer.  All you have to do is tie a small X-Wide Gap or Drop Shot hook directly to your mainline.  I recommend either 6 or 8 lb. Extra limp monofilament.   BOTTOM BOUNCING  Bottom bouncing is a very effective technique for fishing deeper pools more methodically. Although the leader length may vary from 36・to 12・depending on the type of water and the species of Salmon you are targeting.  This technique allows the angler to use a multitude of baits, the most popular being cured or treated roe.  The idea behind this rigging is to offer the bait as natural as possible while maintaining control of the rig with your rod tip. After you cast slightly upstream, maintain in contact with the weight/bottom by reeling in any slack line (until line is taut) and lifting your rod tip slightly allowing the weight to bounce off the rocks. Keep in mind when offering any bait maintaining proper drifting speed can be crucial to whether or not you hit a fish or not.  When the fish strikes your bottom bouncing rig, your rod tip usually drops with a spongy weight, set the hook and hold on. Take a look at our Leader Savers which will save you time and money while bottom bouncing for salmon or other large fish. "
