Rather than roll the dice on being able to cross the lake InOctober from Sturgeon falls to fish the upper French River area, I,ve been told that there are a couple of marinas/lodges in Dokis that rent cabins/cottages/boats. That way we could run down the river from there.  If anyone has any info that they'd like to pass along - i.e. names etc, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks."

2810,steve_paul,2006-11-20 19:19:00,658,Also Chaudiere Lodge - www.chaudierelodge.com but I am not sure they are open in October.  Could try Lunge Lodge as well.
2840,Daplumma,2006-11-20 19:57:00,1961,Casa Blanca is right there by Lunge Lodge.I haven't stayed there for a few years but it was exellent when I went. Joe
2885,rob v,2006-11-20 21:01:00,535,Hey thanks a bunch for the info !!  Greatly appreciated.  I'm told its about a 20 minute +/- boat ride (15 foot tinny going 15-20 miles an hour) down the river to the lake.  Does that sound correct ?  thanks again.
2887,Raf,2006-11-20 21:02:00,3495,up-river  and that sounds about right.  no need to leave the river though!
2895,Daplumma,2006-11-20 21:18:00,1961,Maybe a few minutes longer than that.Down river would be ugly!!There are lots of great areas to fish on the way to the lake.I never had to leave the river in the 5 or 6 times I stayed there.Marty knows that area pretty well. Joe
2962,steve_paul,2006-11-20 23:14:00,658,"I agree, lots of great fishing right around there.  I have not been up there in October before but our aunt says it is pretty quiet up there that time of year."
