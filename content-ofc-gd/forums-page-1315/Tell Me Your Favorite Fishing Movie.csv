1893,Weeds,2006-11-18 20:57:00,782,I'd have to say Big Fish (2003) with Ewan McGregor. Good flick. Only a little bit of fish'n but still cool.

2012,Rich,2006-11-19 02:59:00,3927,I agree with Grumpy Old Men
2013,FISHEYEZ,2006-11-19 02:59:00,49,"gone fishin is a good one,   surprised only one other mention for it.....   a river runs.... is another good one,"
2014,Garyv,2006-11-19 03:00:00,547,Well there not fishing movies however some deal with water.  1.  Master and Commander...The far side of the world  ( one of the few I purchased and didn't download )  2.  A Prefect storm  3.  The Shipping News  ( watched it 5 times so far )  4.  American Beauty  ( Kevin Spacey is one of my favourite actors )  5.  Napoleon Dynamite  ( don't ask me why )  6.  Man In The Wilderness  ( old but a classic )  7.  A Man for all Seasons  ( Thomas Moore had scruples )  8.  Driving Miss Daisy  ( See it more than 10 times )  And probably 10 or there about others.

2098,jediangler,2006-11-19 07:07:00,1923,"Put up another vote for ""Old Man and the Sea"". Can't beat Hemmingway. Best character in a fishing movie goes to this guy.  Gotta love when the fisherman becomes fish food. Best fishing scene is in ""Waterworld"" where Costner uses himself as bait, trolling behind his boat."
2100,BabyHerc,2006-11-19 07:53:00,285,Gotta agree with Express168 on this one: Gone Fishing with Joe Pesci and Danny Glover.

I read some of it on the internet and found it very interesting. I will check it out for sure. I also found a movie called Jeremiah Johnson that you may find interesting.  http://videodetective.com/default.asp?fram...ublishedID=1778"
