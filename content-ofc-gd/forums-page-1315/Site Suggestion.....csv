I just realized that I'm forever looking one up online, and it's not adjusted for Ontario.... I dont know if they actually work or not, but they're fun to look at....  Rick...if you're not too busy...hehe."
2744,lilkynan,2006-11-20 17:33:00,173,I use the GPS timer for fishing and hunting all the time. It works great - the calender does a fine job also - I like it.  Bare
2922,urbanangler1990,2006-11-20 22:20:00,933,"yeah that would be a great idea. I also look all over for it on the web, hard to find, i usually dont find any good ones, or any for ontario."
2926,misfish,2006-11-20 22:22:00,29133," I also use my GPS,so far it is wrong.LOL"
2932,fishindevil,2006-11-20 22:35:00,6254,"yes cliff i think it would be great,i look at mine on my GPS,but its still good to have one on the board as well,good idea"

2966,pameladallaire,2006-11-20 23:24:00,470,I like the idea. It is very hard to find one for the whole year.  Pam
