2823,Northwoodslivin,2006-11-20 19:29:00,2,A fine hunting dog he will make one day if trained cute!
2880,Handlebarz,2006-11-20 20:53:00,3790,"Well Im glad to see that you guys stayed away from bait sized pooches that could get interesting next summer having him looking off the front of the boat when your getting ready to next a 50""er congratz on the sleepless nights guys later Mike"
2940,Carp,2006-11-20 22:43:00,1488,Cute and cuddly.  Congrats.  
2943,Pigeontroller,2006-11-20 22:51:00,2793,"Very cute puppy! I'm not sure if I like you using my name though, Diogenes Alejandro Xenos is quite a handle for a dog!"
3092,Rattletrap2,2006-11-21 02:39:00,1652,"The crate was a great tool for us. Ours slept all night in his crate (cage) and spent his days there if we were out. Now that he is older, he still sleeps in his cage a lot, but the door is always open now. He loves it! We keep a cover over it in the kitchen and I guess the darkness gives him some security and comfort."
2188,graftongal,2006-11-19 15:42:00,145,"After a long wait Reefhawg and I finally picked up our new baby on Friday night.  He's been an incredibly good puppy thus far, no separation anxiety from being away from his family.  He seems very observant and is even walking well with a leash for his first time.  I have never seen such a docile puppy before!  Things will probably be a far different story though on Monday morning when we have to go to work.  We picked him up from Baby Duck Labs in Chatsworth near Owen Sound.  Mike Lafond is the guy's name and he was excellent, really knows his stuff.  He's still got a couple of pups that are unspoken for and is offering them at an excellent price if anyone is looking for a pup.  Feel free to message me and I'll give you his info.  Here he is, Baby Duck's Esox Masquinongy ""Dax"":    "

2687,Joey,2006-11-20 15:34:00,9122,What a cutie.  Hopefully he's not too destructive the first couple of times you leave him alone.  My sister used to leave the camcorder on in the corner of the living room to see what the dog did while they were away when they first got their puppy.  Maybe give that a try to see what he gets up to so you can hide valuables he's sniffing out  Joey
2718,1leggedangler,2006-11-20 16:52:00,364,"Congrats to the both of you,  One beautiful pup for sure. Our chocolate lab was the smartest dog we ever owned but be forwarned make sure the garbage is always put away because they can be worse than goats!!  Cheers, 1leg"
2725,OhioFisherman,2006-11-20 17:05:00,6623,"Nice puppy! Are those stuffed ducks in the picture? LOL they last maybe 10 minutes here, our 2 Bostons have a tug of war with them, and then with the stuffing."
