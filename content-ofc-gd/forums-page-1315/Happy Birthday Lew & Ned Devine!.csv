My son Paul (Ned Devine) stopped into Bass Pro with my Daughter-in-law and my Grandson and later Saturday night I joined a great group of OFNers to wish Lew an early Birthday greeting (I'm sure Robin will post more on that later). Two great people and I wish them both all the best on their big day. Oh, by the way Ned, Mom wishes you a Happy Birthday and she loves you very much"
