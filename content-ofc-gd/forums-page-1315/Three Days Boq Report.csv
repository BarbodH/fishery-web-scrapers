2776,icefisherman,2006-11-20 18:08:00,952,"OK Guys,  I see others have already reported their results, so let me do mine. Started last Friday with terrible weather and gusty winds/rain mixture. Not very pleasant and tough to fish. Came empty handed after 3 hours of trying hard. Speaking of what a difference a day makes. Saturday was as calm as BOQ gets - about 10km/h and walleye were hungry. Started early fished for most of the day and our boat did good. One came in the boat. One was released at the boat. And two more were hooked and lost before getting to the boat. Day was full of excitement and laugh. Decided to give it an other try bright and early on Sunday for just few hours before heading back home. Doug decided to rewind a bit, sleep later and chat with good old friends at the cottage, so I went alone. Started fishing about 7:15. 30min later had my first for the day. Two hours later got one more. By then it was time to head back and start packing. All my fish were caught on Rapala (glass clown) and bleeding tiger. Sizes were: 2 x 29"" and 1 x 30"". Doug's fish was considerably bigger, maybe 30+""... Sorry Sam, I gave my best shot to the lures I bought from you (Mann's Doctor - Death and Blueberry muffin and Reef Runners - Cheap Sunglasses and Errie Descent) but could not get even a sniff on them. On the other side Rapalas were kicking ass big time. Fish caught were about 30' deep in 50-75 few. Trollong at 1.6-1.7 mph. Combination of planner boards and flat lines.  It was nice meeting tons of OFC guys. Great memories for ever. I'd like to thank Wayne for letting me stay at his cottage and Dan and Terry for the company. Doug, it was pleasure as always. I may miss some names so I won't mention the other 10-15 people I've met with at the cottages. Here are few pictures.           Cheers and see you next year same place. Ice Fisherman"

2832,SlowPoke,2006-11-20 19:42:00,2984,"Nice fish Emil !! Some wild reports coming out of BOQ... I'm putting it on my ""to do list"" for next year. -Brian"
2837,Nemo,2006-11-20 19:51:00,727,Nice fish you're doing well this year.
2900,Joey,2006-11-20 21:30:00,9122,It was great meeting you Emil.  Look forward to doing some ice fishing with you this year.  Joey
2934,Carp,2006-11-20 22:37:00,1488,Nice to meet you Emil. You did well out there.  I fished hard Sat and Sun with only one hit and nothing to show for it. I finally gave up at dark on Sun night.  Maybe we should have fished together. I was alone all weekend. Next trip bud.
2972,tjsa,2006-11-20 23:34:00,1578,"Nice report, too bad I will in all probability never make this event, work related reasons, and the damn flight expense, lol. The cost of the flight would be more than putting out the cost for the cabin, launch, food, etc. etc."
2974,fishindevil,2006-11-20 23:46:00,6254,"very nice report & pic,glad you guys did well on the boq"
2988,irishfield,2006-11-21 00:07:00,26272,GREAT stuff Emil ! You are more than welcome on the cottage use...at least you didn't snore us out of the F'n place like Buster did Sunday night after we made him stay the night after his Grey Cup festivities! LOL
2994,GNODDY,2006-11-21 00:18:00,163,Nice fish congrats
3123,icefisherman,2006-11-21 03:18:00,952,"Clampet,  we were actually doing 4 lines (east of the ferry). Two with planner boards and two flat lines. Flat lines were over 200'+ back and boards were 185' from the board to the lure and 100' from the boat to the board. We were marking fish all over the water column but the ones 25-30' deep were the actively feeding ones. Hope this helps.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
3127,fishnsled,2006-11-21 03:21:00,3520,Great report and nice to have met you Ice Fisherman
3135,DT10Sam,2006-11-21 03:30:00,480," Great report Emil sorry that the lures did not work for you, this is the BOQ and as I mentioned it seems that at times someone just turned the switch off and the bite is off and then at times it turns on and everything works.  Great to have met you and I will see you at future functions.  Best regards, Sam"
3138,Mike the Pike,2006-11-21 03:33:00,3421,Good report nice fish.Nice meeting you.see you next year.Mike the Pike
