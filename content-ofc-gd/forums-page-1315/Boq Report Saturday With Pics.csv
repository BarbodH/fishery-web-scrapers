3093,irishfield,2006-11-21 02:40:00,26272,"Great meeting you too Mike! And you are right..and the word ain't ""brave"" for the wack jobs in the canoe with Electric trolling motor...going down the center of Adolphus Reach. Not even wearing life jackets that I could see."
3105,Mike the Pike,2006-11-21 02:53:00,3421,Oh the people in the canoe had life jackets on but what good would that do in 44 degree weather  There were two boneheads escorted back to merlands by the OPP for having no PFD's on board.These are the people you read about in the news.
3118,PERCHER,2006-11-21 03:15:00,787,  WHOOPS  
3133,Dondorfish,2006-11-21 03:28:00,1000,"Mike the Pike - It was nice to get to finally meet a bunch of you guys in person. Sure wish we would have stayed at Merland Park. It seems like it was hoot judging by the short time I was there at the fire. Sorry I didn't get to meet some of you other guys. Even thou we were skunked this year, we really enjoyed the trip - Already making plans to attend the event next year. Was it just me or does Roy seem taller on the board?    Thanks again ALL     Don    "
3134,fishnsled,2006-11-21 03:28:00,3520,"Nice report Mike the Pike!   Looking forward to seeing a pic of that 11.4.  I couldn't believe the pic the first time I saw it of the clowns in the canoe and I still can't believe it.   Not a place for a canoe that time of year, perhaps anytime of the year IMO."
3147,Mike the Pike,2006-11-21 03:43:00,3421,the 11.4 is the one caught in the dark at 5pm.also a shot looking down his mouth.check out the teeth.
