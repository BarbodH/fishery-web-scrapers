Draw knots as tight as possible. 4. Trim tag ends close to the knot. =====================================================================   Specialist Fly Knot   Spider Hitch The offshore fisherman often have a need to tie a double line - a long loop of line that is obviously stronger, and easier to handle, than the line itself. In accordance with International Game Fish Association Rules, the double line may be up to 4.5m long in lines up to 10kg, and as much as 9m in heavier lines.  The double may be tied by means of the simple Spider Hitch with lines to 15kg. The big game boys use the Bimini Twist, a double that is normally formed by two people who make the intitial twenty twists. The Bimini is obviously beyond the scope of this little book. It's smaller brother, the Spider Hitch, is a much faster and easier knot for the light tackle fisherman.  Form a loop of the desired length, say 1.25m. Twist a section into a small loop. This is the only tricky part - hold this loop with thumb and forefinger, the thumb extending above the finger, and with the loop standing up beyond the tip of the thumb. Wind the doubled line around the thumb and the loop 5 times. Send the rest of the long loop through the small loop, and pull gently to unwind the turns off the thumb. The knot is now formed and worked into tight coils.   Surgeon's End Loop The Surgeon's End Loop forms a loop at the end of a line. This provides a means to quickly attach leaders and other tackle. This end loop is very easy to tie and very reliable, but it is slightly more bulky than the Perfection Loop.   Surgeon's Knot One of the quickest and strongest knots for joining leader material to line with unequal diameters. Some people get confused when looking at drawings of this simple knot because the drawings do not show the full leader length. Just remember to pass the end of the line and the whole leader through the loop twice.   Trilene Knot The Trilene Knot is a strong reliable connection that resists slippage and premature failures.  The Trilene Knot is an all-purpose connection to be used in joining monofilament to swivels, snaps, hooks and artificial lures. The knot's unique design and ease of tying yield consistently strong, dependable connections while retaining 85-90% of the original line strength. The double wrap of mono through the eyelet provides a protective cushion for added safety.   Tucked Sheet Bend Usually employed by the fly fisherman, the Tucked Sheet Bend is commonly used for joining the backing line to the tapered line. It is not an especially compact knot, but has a very strong attachment which cannot be said for the more aesthetically pleasing Perfection Loop.  Make a Blood Bight at the end of the backing line. Take the end of the tapered line. Pass it through the Blood Bightand make a simple Sheet Bend. Now pass the end of the tapered line back through the closed loop of the Sheet Bend. Hold both ends of the tapered line to tighten and draw into shape.   Turle Knot I have included the still-used Turle Knot for old times sake. Also known as the Turtle Knot, and Major Turle's Knot, it is simplicity itself to tie, but is one of the weakest knots.  It should never be used for light lines, and there are better knots for use with heavy ones.  Pass the line through the eye of the hook. Make a simple loop. Carry the end of the line on to make a Simple Overhand Knot upon the loop. Pass the loop over the hook. Draw up into shape.   Uni Knot The Uni Knot is a good alternative to the Improved Clinch. It is very reliable and very easy to tie. This is a good knot when it is getting dark or if your eye sight is less than perfect!   Wedge Knot "
