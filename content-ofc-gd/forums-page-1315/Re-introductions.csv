2814,lunkerbasshunter,2006-11-20 19:22:00,2585,i joined the board april 2005 i think.  I am from oakville.  i mainly fish lake nipissing as i have lots of family up there.  This year i did a fair amount of fishing but since i have a little one at home that was added to the family april 2006 i did not get out as much as I would have liked this year.  Can't wait for the little guy to get a bit older so I can take him fishing!  Love the board and reports!  Cheers!
2964,douG,2006-11-20 23:19:00,2693,"I joined this board in 2003 when I decided to join my Dad and Bro on their twice yearly trip to Algonquin park after a friend's father passed away.  My friend spoke to me about his regrets over the lack of time that they had spent together, and I decided that I had been a fool, and that it was time to fix this situation.  I used to fish lakers north of Peterborough and into Algonquin park with my family when I was much much younger, but gave up the whole fishing thing for about 30 years.  I then started to join the old man's crew in May and September in Algonquin.  I joined this board around that time to try to learn about fishing.  Since then, I have accumulated a huge amount of clothing, camping gear, and fishing gear and tackle.  I have met some lifelong friends here on OFC, and I look forward to meeting many more.  Now, I fish for lakers, whitefish, walleye, perch, muskie, salmon, and steelhead, all over southern Ontario, four hours from Toronto all year round.  This is a wonderful community, distinguished by a love of fishing and the outdoors, and a sincere desire to help and support our hobby and our friends."
2982,mepps,2006-11-20 23:55:00,1301,"My name is Clive. Born in the British Virgin Islands, where my father was a deep sea fisherman.  Spent my younger years fishing catfish and panfish in Virginia.  We moved to Canada in the late 80s. Spent some time fishing in BC for salmon.  Spent most of my life in Port Credit Ontario and spent summers at Jack lake fishing bass and musky. For the last 2 years I have lived outside of Canada, a year in Mexico, anda  year in the Virgin Islands.  I am back in Ontario, currently residing in London right beside the Thames river.  I make spinner baits in my spare time.  One of my favorite things about growing up in Ontario was easy access to several great fishign places like Toronto Islands.  "

3265,Fly Me In Scotty,2006-11-21 14:31:00,34,My name is Chris I am now back on this site as haulinbass because of my annual fly in trip to Lake X which I have done for about 10 years now.  I love to fish and camp. I bought a junker of a boat last year and have alot of work to do to get it up to standard as misfish would know.  Live in Brantford and work in Mississauga. Recently married and yes still am able to fish. I hope to get out and enjoy the company of some of you fine folk from the board one of these days.  I have been to 1 swill and it was a great time.
2089,Rattletrap2,2006-11-19 05:29:00,1652,"I can't say for sure, but I believe I have been around here since the first version of the board! Many, many changes, and every one of them for the better. I used my own name (BrianS) at the beginning, but changed over to Rattletrap2 somewhere along the way.  My main species is Bass (both Largemouth and Smallmouth), but I do fish for Walleye, Crappie, Pike, and whatever else comes along.  In my younger days, I did some stream fishing for native Brown and Rainbow Trout, but I have not done that for a long time around here. I did get to do a little this year in North Carolina, and that brought back some memories. I am looking forward to the hard water season again now, and that is something that hanging around on this site did for me! I used to hate winters between Bass seasons, but really enjoy the ice fishing now. Sure makes the winter more enjoyable! "
2094,danc,2006-11-19 05:59:00,4677,"I'm not sure how long I've been on OFC, but I made the ""old members"" photo thread, so it's been a while. Born and raised in Thunder Bay, I became obsessed with Steelhead fishing in the 70's. I could hardly sleep when the run was on back then. But the first fish that I ever caught was a Brook Trout, when my father took me out to a few local creeks when I was probably 7 or 8 years old. My passion for Brook Trout fishing took a serious turn about 15 years ago when I started fishing them seriously. I haven't looked back since. I still do some Steelhead fishing and dabble for Walleye, but come late August and early September I'm totally focused on the Brook Trout. I've met some great people from OFC that I wuld have never met otherwise and hope to meet more in the future.  OFC really does rock!!!  "

2138,Chris,2006-11-19 13:50:00,405,"Hi, I've been lurking on this board for a long, long time. Had some fun with some members quite a while back under the board name ""The Perfect Angler""....anybody remember???   I've been fishing for over 40 years. A mult-species angler all of my life, I was hit with the muskie bug in 1989 and have been fishing for them ever since. Just started to get back to fishing some other species again last year, but still have a passion for the mighty lunge. I was the editor for Muskies Canada's bi-monthly publication, the ""Release Journal"" for three years from 2002 to the end of 2004.  Here's a pic of my bro' with a typical Ottawa River muskie: "
2232,setomonkey,2006-11-19 16:55:00,872,"Hi everyone, my name is Mike (setomonkey here) and I've been on the board for a while, not sure when but it was two versions ago, so it's been a few years.  Really enjoy the board, I've learned a lot and I've had the chance to meet some OFNers too.  I never fished as a kid and only started fishing about 7 years ago, after a friend of mine who's fished all his life finally convinced me to go out with him for an afternoon. We fished his parents' lake from a 12' tinny and I still remember how excited I was when I caught my first fish (sunfish).  Caught a bunch of panfish and small bass that day on jigs & worms, and I was hooked. Got my first rod that Christmas, along with a small tacklebox that I was sure would be more than enough for my needs. LOL. Now I've got 6 or 7 different rods & reels, and a big tacklebox that my wife affectionately (I think) refers to as my ""tackle suitcase"". Quite a lot more than I ever figured I'd need, but not as much gear as some guys have!     Still waiting for the right time to get my first boat...  I like fishing for lots of different species, but my favourites are bass, pike, muskie, & trout, though I don't do much musky or trout fishing.  I travel as part of my work and whenever I can I try to find some time to fish wherever I'm visiting.  So I've had a chance to fish in California, Illinois, Florida, New Mexico, & Utah (so far).  This is the first and only striper I've ever caught, on a reservoir in New Mexico a couple of years ago.    Mike"
