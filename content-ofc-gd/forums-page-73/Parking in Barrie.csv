1020995,tender52,2018-01-10 02:58:00,270,I looked on line and it says municipal parking for $15 a day. My question is where to park with lake access? I have never been to Downtown Barrie and I want to bring a buddy who's never been ice fishing in Ontario. He's a Nova Scotia boy. Any advice is greatly appreciated

If you look on the city of barrie website, you can likely find a map of all the parking lots down town."

1021013,farsider,2018-01-10 17:40:00,456,Can't you park on sidestreets after 7am?  As long is there is no weather coming?  I believe there is no overnight parking allowed.  (wouldn't want any visitors?) 
1021021,misfish,2018-01-10 19:02:00,29133,"They have posted no parking at one well known area, but I seen no tickets on any of the cars or trucks. All other areas I know really dont have road access here. Parking lots that charge $15 for a day or $3 an hour."
