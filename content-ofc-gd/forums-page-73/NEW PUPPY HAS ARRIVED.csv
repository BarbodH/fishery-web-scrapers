1020288,lunkerbasshunter,2017-12-25 08:47:00,2585,I posted before about a new puppy coming soon.  We finally picked her up last wed.  She is a sweet Mini Golden Doodle.  Her name is Whiskey.  My other dog loves her.  She has been sleeping well (just woke up to go pee 3am) but other then that she has slept through the night since Wed.  She is crate trained already and knows basics commands like sit and come already.  Smart girl! We can't wait to get her out on the water in May! Cheers!    IMG_1297.m4v  IMG_1297.m4v
