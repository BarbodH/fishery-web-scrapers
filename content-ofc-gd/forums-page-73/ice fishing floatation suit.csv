1020612,PUMP KNOWS,2018-01-02 00:46:00,937,Any good deals out on a floatation suit or ice fishing suit? I would like to give ice fishing a try this year.
1020617,SirCranksalot,2018-01-02 02:05:00,3291,Check Can Tire in-store clearance items on-line 
1020618,PUMP KNOWS,2018-01-02 02:19:00,937,I've been checking and calling but they're mostly ghost stock 
1020620,SirCranksalot,2018-01-02 03:05:00,3291,I find on-line the best way. I can check several stores within a reasonable drive. I got an outfit last year for less than 1/2 price.
1020625,Dutch01,2018-01-02 05:21:00,1431,I think what PUMP KNOWS was saying is the computer shows stock but there really isn't. It's happened to me with couple of CT clearance orders. I boughtonline for in store pickup which was confirmed but then they sent a cancellation. When I went back to the website it then showed zero stock.
1020627,Acountdeleted,2018-01-02 14:55:00,2562,Get one used. Here or Kajiiji. Just as good as new.
1020628,AKRISONER,2018-01-02 14:56:00,5558,bought mine used off of a board member saved myself a few hundo $$ and the thing is awesome.
1020631,SirCranksalot,2018-01-02 15:08:00,3291,PK and I exchanged a couple of PMs. I understand the issue he's having. I have had that prob as well. It might be the 'third time lucky' sort of thing!!
1020640,Dutch01,2018-01-02 17:12:00,1431,Roger that
1020660,Woodsman,2018-01-02 23:38:00,1286,If used for icefishing with no intensions of using it as your floation device in a boat than Department of Transport (Canada) certification is not required. For these suits Royal Distributing have some good floating snowmobile suits. I prefer a 2 peice suit.  
1020676,Dara,2018-01-03 15:38:00,3052,I'm not going on any ice where I might need a flotation suit. A half decent snowmobile suit should be all you need
1020709,PUMP KNOWS,2018-01-04 18:34:00,937,Thanks for the tips guys. 2 piece would be great and I don't plan on going anywhere with sketchy ice.
1020761,Shloim,2018-01-05 14:12:00,515,Sail had some no name brand suits on sale cheap. Less than 200. And rapala 2 pc suits for around 400 on sale
1020776,Dara,2018-01-05 16:09:00,3052,You don't need the greatest suit. Lots of layers underneath is the key so get it big enough to fit stuff. and let you move comfortably.A nice high collar that zips right up is a good feature and big pockets
1020782,PUMP KNOWS,2018-01-05 17:02:00,937,"I'll have to check Sail again.  Were they flotation suits for less then $200? Gotcha.  Do you size up?  From the ads I see on kijiji, they usually say it fits a size smaller then whats labelled."
1020787,SirCranksalot,2018-01-05 17:37:00,3291,"Bear in mind that the more 'normal' clothes you wear, the more water will soak in and weigh you down when trying to get out."
1020815,Dara,2018-01-05 21:29:00,3052,"Walmart..marks workwearhouse...try one on Sorry, I just don't shop on line except for tools at Lee Valley"
1020816,Shloim,2018-01-05 21:41:00,515,"Hey Pump I remember you from the kayak site, Sold my yak, bought a small boat. I believe they were floaters, the brand was some initials. The Rapala stuff was not float but ice fishing wear and it was $400... now the ice is pretty good everywhere, but if you were to ever go through ( I pray its never) How much would the suit be worth to you then? Just saying, there's alot to be said about perspective...."
1020823,SirCranksalot,2018-01-05 22:15:00,3291,Yup---don't cheap out on safety eqpt!
1020847,PUMP KNOWS,2018-01-06 14:14:00,937,I just saw a pic of someone falling through a pressure crack...scary stuff.
