She is a prop designer in our studio and the sister of a famous Canadian designer!"
1020746,lew,2018-01-05 10:20:00,12766,"WOW, you dug back ALOT of years to find that one Norm  hahaha"
1020749,AKRISONER,2018-01-05 11:48:00,5558,"great job guys, woulda been awesome to get out with you guys...i guess we will see what happens next year. gotta love a pic of a guy out in the winter, no hut, bare handing, with tear aways on....beast mode.  Hoping to fish tomorrow but the forecast for the morning looks absolutely stupid...perhaps some of the coldest weather I have ever seen in PAB. Right now the forecast is -32c with 40kmh winds...calculated out thats -50c   forget it...hut or anything thats just impossible to try get sleds to run and then get a pop up set up...Ill probably wait until the afternoon when the forecast greatly improves...Jesus you know its friggin cold when -25 with no wind is literally twice as warm as it was in the morning...insanity for Ontario. We didnt even fish in that garbage when i lived in Northern Manitoba."
1020753,NAW,2018-01-05 12:07:00,4022,Jeez AK...  Your hands not toughened up for the ice season yet?  Mine are all dry and cracked already!.. Ready for -50 fishing!
1020759,Acountdeleted,2018-01-05 14:07:00,2562,Never happy. +5 no ice. -60 too cold.  When i was in Alberta we always found a way.  got out yesterday and it sucked. But I got out.
1020760,AKRISONER,2018-01-05 14:11:00,5558,hey i already told the boys...if it hits -25 im going. Yesterday was a toasty warm day compared to what they are predicting for tomorrow morning.
1020766,Acountdeleted,2018-01-05 14:40:00,2562,Actually I'm loving this cold weather. Getting out on spots I never thought I would have before. (Hint: Yesterday I could see the CN tower while I fished.) Was just too damn windy to get anything set up. If we get the warm weather they are predicting in 7-10 days I may be ice fishing in shorts and a t-shirt.
1020769,NAW,2018-01-05 15:02:00,4022,I love fishing in the extreme cold.  There's something about the extra sense of adventure when your out there in extreme conditions. It's just impossible to get my kids out there when it's so cold... Which sucks.
1020818,Shloim,2018-01-05 21:45:00,515,Was a jew? did you convert her or is she still one? lol I work in film a bit too. We are electricians and practical wiring experts
1020826,misfish,2018-01-05 23:40:00,29133,"Saturday is the last real cold snap. I,ll be out. Once Im set up though, thats where Im sitting. Heater will be on full the whole day. Bacon and eggs to get the morning started. Old habits are hard to break.   Notice the date, and the auger . Finbor 3, 6""."
1020827,misfish,2018-01-06 00:03:00,29133,"Man, I cant believe you dont like this winter sport. Look at that SMILE."
1020850,Beans,2018-01-06 16:18:00,3339, February 2003 at Innisifil Big Cliff and I got fined for not wearing helmuts driving back in on his ATV...LOL
1020853,lew,2018-01-06 17:08:00,12766,"Yeah, I remember you guys getting dinged Norm. I think that day was the 1st ever winter get-to-gether we ever had on this board. "
1020856,misfish,2018-01-06 18:57:00,29133,"Nope, this was the first one at the 2nd line of Oro Norm. The year next was at Innisfil."
1020914,AKRISONER,2018-01-08 15:07:00,5558, this is dope always wanted to try this out.  Got out on Saturday -26...no hut...did two hours and my hands went completely numb and i could feel the tips of my fingers starting to get frostbite...got skunked and i called it. Rode the sled home going 35 and frostbit my face...ridiculous. 
1020237,misfish,2017-12-23 17:47:00,29133,"Positive report today. I,ll be out . Lew, my hut has 2 seats. Just saying."
1020242,lew,2017-12-23 18:54:00,12766,You know the answer to that one Bud hahaha
1020245,misfish,2017-12-23 19:42:00,29133," I know Lew, but there wIll be that one time when you will say,,,,,,,,,,  Hey, you didnt ask me to join,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Just covering my ass.  LOL  "
1020246,Fisherman,2017-12-23 19:50:00,7201,"you just haven't found the right bait for him, lol."
1020247,lew,2017-12-23 20:12:00,12766,They haven't invented a bait yet that could entice me to spend a day staring into a frozen hole
1020250,misfish,2017-12-23 21:34:00,29133,"I never look at the hole, unless there Is a fish in it. I look at the graph. Yes, I yell at it a bit. Stupid fish are there, yet wont bite. LOL"
1020252,SirCranksalot,2017-12-23 22:09:00,3291,define 'stupid' !!

1020259,NAW,2017-12-24 01:50:00,4022,Well things are looking great for a christmas morning jig! Must say I am looking forward to it!
1020262,woodenboater,2017-12-24 02:37:00,2277,most of my Jewish friends will be in Chinatown chowing down as they have since the dawn of time 
1020263,Shloim,2017-12-24 11:55:00,515,"Yes, but that is tonight Chinese food and the movies are our only options"
1020281,GBW,2017-12-24 22:14:00,8460,Good luck to all that get out.  I may later in the day do some searching around here.  I know I won't be on my folks lake as I was there yesterday and most of today and it's 4 hit's with the spud and through and the ice is all white too.
1020321,Shloim,2017-12-26 12:39:00,515,Had I great day out on the ice with Nick. Thanks to him I got out and got my first though the ice pike! It was all good except for the torture it was dragging my overloaded sleigh. Starting to work on my smitty today! 
1020322,Terry,2017-12-26 12:40:00,14456,nice going
1020329,GBW,2017-12-26 15:18:00,8460,Nice and good to see you guys got out
1020333,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-26 16:16:00,10439,I was having vision problems on Christmas. I couldn't see my butt leaving the house!!!! 
1020337,Fisherman,2017-12-26 17:58:00,7201,That's beyond rude temperatures.
1020338,misfish,2017-12-26 18:14:00,29133,Nicely done. What is your thought on the auger set up ? I see it in the back ground.
1020352,akaShag,2017-12-27 01:41:00,2073,"I actually quite like the cold, and very much enjoy ice fishing.  And I do not have nor do I use a hut. But minus 38 F is FREAKIN' chilly!!!!! Rum and eggnog weather there Dave.  Doug"
1020353,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-27 01:50:00,10439,"Yup, chillin' at the crib. -25C with no wind and I'll fish outside for days. -50 windhills have me hunkered down. I will fish @ -40 windchills in my hut."
1020357,NAW,2017-12-27 03:30:00,4022,"We had a great time out there!  Nice to meet you Shloim!  Good luck with the Smitty build! Sam worked a night shift last night,  I picked her up at the hospital at 6am.  We where on the ice and jigging by 7am.  We did good today, but caught way to many dinks!   Brought home two dozen nice eater perch between the two days.  Going to have our family christmas tomorrow and fry them up with some chips and a ceasar salad!  Keep it easy!  As for the cold Temps there Drifter!  Man, I used to love the cold.  Been out in sub 40 windchills several times.  Always open holing it too.  You know its cold when you need to start a fire to keep your beer from freezing..."
1020360,Shloim,2017-12-27 12:07:00,515,Here are some photos NAW  took while out there. Notice me way back in the distance.....lol Very humbling pulling that one man hut. Thanks again  Nick it was a great day. I'm all over the sled build. Hope to be using it tomorrow....    
1020362,Fish Farmer,2017-12-27 12:43:00,2234,How was the parking at Lefroy?
1020371,misfish,2017-12-27 19:08:00,29133,What snow are you talking about ? Thats just a dusting. SHEECH.
1020733,Beans,2018-01-05 00:15:00,3339,Just saying 
1020008,NAW,2017-12-20 15:06:00,4022,"Just a random question because I have been pondering it myself.  My girlfriend works at the Hospital in Barrie.  And she has to works every other year on Christmas day.  We have 3 kids between the two of us, and both have joint custody.  So this year, my GF is working 12 hour night shifts Dec 24 and 25.  And the kids are all at their other parents house. Anyone else here need to deal with this sort of messed up schedule?   Not having your family with you on Christmas.... The only thing I can think of to do Christmas morning, is to go ice fishing!! Does anyone else here love ice fishing so much to go out on Christmas morning...alone..? I've gone out Christmas eve before (with Jer I think..)  But never actually on Christmas day,  I'll be going out for Crappie, if there's any other loners out there that want to join!"
1020009,bigugli,2017-12-20 15:11:00,6138,My son and I have gone out in the afternoon Christmas Day. Had nothing better to do as the family had planned the big dinner for Boxing Day.
1020010,AKRISONER,2017-12-20 15:22:00,5558,"Nick, its becoming a tradition of my own the last couple of years with the christmas falling on the weekend to go up north that weekend with a couple of buddies. My christmas' fall on off years, so this year its on christmas day, Last year it was boxing day. Last year the guys went home on christmas eve and I spent christmas day by myself at the lake...it was a really cool feeling getting up at 7am and going out on the ice solo on christmas morning. you may never hear a quieter time, even the distant highway noises completely subsided. As it got a little later i started noticing a bit more movement around as people were going to visit families etc but it was a morning well spent. Unfortunately I have to be back in Toronto for 12 on Christmas day this year or I would be joining you for some crapolas for sure."
1020012,Shloim,2017-12-20 16:21:00,515,Where are ya going for em? I'm available as it's hard to be a jew on Christmas.. ...
1020013,Mike Pike,2017-12-20 16:40:00,1332,"I  used to enjoy walking out to drill a few holes for perch on Cook's Bay every Christmas Day.  Mind you, that's years ago when our winters used to be colder and more stable.  Anyhoo, it used to be me and a bunch of Russians and other ethnic fellows who celebrate Christmas on January 7th."
1020015,NAW,2017-12-20 16:48:00,4022,"I don't know where I will be going yet.  Somewhere within a 45 minute drive from Barrie. The weather over the next 4 days will determine where I will go, or if at all... I'll PM you in the near future if my plans come together!  "
1020016,NAW,2017-12-20 16:48:00,4022,I bet it gets really quiet out there on Christmas morning!  I never thought out that.  True piece and quiet for a few hours.
1020020,misfish,2017-12-20 17:29:00,29133,"YUP, Like you, weather will be the deciding factor. Ice or river. Either way, Christmas fishing here."
1020021,Fisherman,2017-12-20 18:11:00,7201,"There are reports of people fishing the lake across from RVH, parking might be a head scratcher.  The south end of Cooks Bay also has people out fishing already, parking is a lot easier on Gilford Rd.  A couple more days of cold and it should be ok."
1020023,Sinker,2017-12-20 18:20:00,8692,"I used to always fish on xmas day, before I had kids. I always got some sort of new fishing gear I just HAD to try out that day....lol I plan to fish as many days as my body can handle from boxing day to jan. 4th though.....  S."
1020025,BillM,2017-12-20 18:31:00,17367,"Nick, I'm off until the 2nd should be back the 26th.  Let me know if you wanna get out."
1020044,Joeytier,2017-12-20 21:06:00,3990,"This was the first year since starting a family that I didnt volunteer to work Xmas, and I end up having to work from the 22nd straight thru to the 27th...d'oh"
1020047,NAW,2017-12-20 21:29:00,4022,"WoW!  I thought I was going to be one of the crazy guys out there who would consider fishing on christmas!  I'm going to have to show this  post to my girlfriend so she will stop thinking im nuts!  I have some pondering to do now, and a few PM's to send."
1020048,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-20 21:45:00,10439,"I'm alone every Christmas morning unless I travel 6,000 kms to be with family. I crawl out of bed late, cook myself a kick donkey brecky and chill on da couch watchin' TEEVEE with a rum in me hand!!!! It really sucks!!! I don't advise it.  When I lived back in Mississauga I used to go and spend a few hours drifting for steel on the Credit on Christmas. Early and late with the fam and fishin' in between while the feast was cookin'."
1020056,GBW,2017-12-20 22:48:00,8460,"Hey Nick, I have my kids on the weekend but they are back at their mothers house on Christmas eve so depending where you go I may be in so keep me posted too if ya want G"
1020060,SirCranksalot,2017-12-20 23:19:00,3291,"You mean as opposed to the rest of the year!!!. Happy Hanukah, shilom Shloim!!"
1020063,Shloim,2017-12-20 23:53:00,515,I mean especially then! the rest of the year usually isnt too bad...
1020071,porkpie,2017-12-21 01:21:00,2521,"As a shift worker all of my life, I have fished xmas day in the past.  Since children, absolutely not.  Now if I an not at home on Christmas its because I am at work."
1020080,Acountdeleted,2017-12-21 01:54:00,2562,Not Christmas Day but New Year's Day...... and New Year's Eve for that matter.  Actually this will be the first time in 4 years I won't be fishing Christmas Eve. Good luck bud. Hope the fish are good to ya.
1020105,NAW,2017-12-21 15:07:00,4022,So my GF wants to wake up early on Christmas and do something with me.  So I will need to be home for noon.   But she is happy that I am going to get out on the ice Christmas! Now I just need a firm up my plans for what lake I am going to hit.!  PM me if you want to join.
1020117,pics,2017-12-21 19:19:00,1268,If I fished Christmas day I would probably be single by boxing day.. Working 12hr nights both Christmas and boxing day this year... I should have been a school teacher...
1020123,misfish,2017-12-21 21:18:00,29133,"Atleast you know , that if you do, you know what to do. Hasent worked for me, and been doing it for many years."
1020124,Fisherman,2017-12-21 21:19:00,7201,"I did the shift stuff for 25 in the CF and another 10 years as a dispatcher,  you end up working one or the other.  Those with kids and singles were always given first choice, rightly so.  I do the cooking at Christmas so I'm home..but looking at the fishing reports."
1020129,huzzsaba,2017-12-21 21:42:00,884,If I was in town I would take you up on that offer. Maybe in 2019 lol if you are solo
1020130,lew,2017-12-21 21:47:00,12766,"I was something similar, between the Navy and then the Fire Dept. I seemed to work either Christmas or New Years for most of 35 years.. We were pretty flexible with our shifts though as far a switching with other guys so plenty of times the single guys would take a Christmas shift for the family guys then he'd he'd take New Years Eve off and the family guy would cover for him."
