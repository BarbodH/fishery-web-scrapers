1020945,DanD,2018-01-09 09:03:00,2223,Nice! Thanks for the report. Dan. 
1020947,b2kptbo,2018-01-09 11:39:00,1505,"Some nice ones, good stuff..."
1020948,NAW,2018-01-09 13:00:00,4022,"Good job!  I know they are in that shallow.  But for some reason, I can't stand fishing that shallow.  I need that 15 - 40 ' on my fish finder or I get this mental block....   Plus I usually fish a few holes, and my humminbird doesn't mark multiple lures that shallow..."
1020951,Acountdeleted,2018-01-09 14:33:00,2562,With all the perch in Simcoe I find my flasher shows me one of two things. 1) perch aren't there and I see my lure and nothing else 2) the school of perch came in and all I see is one massive red bar on my sonar.
1020980,sleepjigging,2018-01-09 23:12:00,207,"I agree. The first jumbo snuck up on me. Nothing on the sonar before he hooked himself. I hate staring at an empty screen (just my jig up and down), and then a tug. But they do come in schools.  I walked around, drilled a few holes. On the way back, retracing my steps and trying the holes a second time, I got lucky and found one, and then the bunch."
