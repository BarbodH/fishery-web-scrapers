1020644,fishsevern,2018-01-02 18:21:00,112,We meet up in Minett if that narrows it down a bit
1020656,SirCranksalot,2018-01-02 22:23:00,3291,Use minnows.  the fish are small and don't often go for spoons and such.
1020723,fishsevern,2018-01-04 21:40:00,112,Thanks for the tip. We'll have minnows.  I saw a you tube video of guys jigging spoons and catching small lakers so have to try it if that fails.  Anyone else been there on ice?

1020730,SirCranksalot,2018-01-04 23:51:00,3291,Some of us use a slip float for their light bite. The smaller ones tend to nibble a bit before swallowing. 
1020735,BillM,2018-01-05 00:57:00,17367,"Those little 2lbr's on Joe smash emeralds like they've never eaten before, lol.   I'm always the one running for  the tipup!!  lol"
1020777,fishsevern,2018-01-05 16:25:00,112,Thanks again guys.  Great tips!  I'll let you know how we do.  If there are any other tips i'd like to know. Cheers
1021237,fishsevern,2018-01-15 16:39:00,112,We had some success Friday-Sunday catching 14 Lakers averaging 1-3 lbs (well 15 if you count the little guy I lost at the hole).  Medium minnows with a small jig or treble off the bottom worked better than anything else.  No ling pike or eyes.  Was a fun weekend.  Thanks for the tips guys.
