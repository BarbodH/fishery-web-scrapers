If it is on their site I highly recommend it. Watching old grainy film it is so strange to see a goalie not wearing a mask. Just as strange as when they all first starting wearing helmets. Jacques Plante was 1st I think to wear a mask, or was it Gump Worsley?  Watching Bower play seems like a lifetime ago. We were all Leaf fans when they won those 3 Holy Grails in the 60's. Don Awrey's brother and nephew George who was our age lived across the street from us in Hamilton. Don Awrey watched us one afternoon play on the 10X20 foot backyard rink with old Sears magazines stuffed down our leggings. He suggested I stick to Football. I wonder what that first Jacques Plante mask would go for? He would draw a line and stiches on it every time a puck hit it. Rest In Peace Mr. Bower. You gave us some thrills watching and learned from you how to be a gentleman."
