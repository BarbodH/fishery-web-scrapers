1020529,misfish,2017-12-31 01:50:00,29133,They are a fast club. Enjoying it. Could be 3-2 not 3-0.
1020530,dave524,2017-12-31 01:56:00,4508,"There was a transport truck fire that had the Niagara bound QEW closed at Bartlett here in Grimsby for hours before the game , bet a lot of fans missed the start of the game.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/grimsby-qew-transport-truck-fire-1.4467450"
1020532,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-31 02:42:00,10439,Natasha Staniszewski from Sportcentre left at 10:45AM and got there in time for the overtime. I wonder how many other people got burned by that wreck? At least she got to watch the game on her cell while stuck in line at the border!!! https://www.bardown.com/sportscentre-s-natasha-staniszewski-hilariously-documented-her-traffic-filled-wjc-trek-to-buffalo-1.955513

Took us 5 hours we made it in time for the first intermission and our tailgating plans got completed scrapped."
1020655,misfish,2018-01-02 22:08:00,29133,"The boys are keeping them pined in the end. Wow. Fast, but yet a bit sloppy."
1020657,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-02 23:10:00,10439,I'm watching at work.
1020659,misfish,2018-01-02 23:33:00,29133,"Games over, back to work. LOL Next game will be a good one. Think the USA have it ?"

1020771,grimsbylander,2018-01-05 15:05:00,3016,"Looking at the previous game stats, the final should be a very good game. My two favorite teams squaring off."
1020831,misfish,2018-01-06 01:32:00,29133,WOW This is a great fast game. ENJOYING IT.  
1020832,lickmyarmpit,2018-01-06 01:34:00,359,
1020833,grimsbylander,2018-01-06 02:19:00,3016,I agree. The right two teams are in the final for sure!
1020834,grimsbylander,2018-01-06 02:19:00,3016,Ouch...I hate shorties lol
1020836,bigugli,2018-01-06 03:26:00,6138,"That was one intense, well played, 3rd period. The best hockey I've seen for some time."

1020840,grimsbylander,2018-01-06 04:38:00,3016,"I can't say that despite the score, Sweden didn't deserve the win. I think they outplayed Canada for the most part but Canada's goal late in the 3rd was the killer. If this was a best of 3 or best of 5, I'd be very concerned. Good on Canada for going hard right to the end. It paid off in gold."
1020845,FloatnFly,2018-01-06 13:00:00,1640,"I hope that Swedish captain gets a good talking to,  poor sport throwing his medal over the glass"

1020135,misfish,2017-12-21 23:35:00,29133,"As every year, I look forward to this tourny. I would think Canada and the USA have the easiest pool to finish 1st 2nd. Whom finishes where is up to them. I would love to see a CAN vs USA final. Atleast, the games are at times we all can watch. Now to find a live stream site that will showing them. GO CANADA GO"

1020347,misfish,2017-12-26 23:43:00,29133,"Nice win Need to watch some of the other teams/games, to see how they compare."
1020387,fish_fishburn,2017-12-28 13:58:00,1311,I haven't been able to watch a game yet but the hilites are good. This team is very deep with good speed Have you noticed the crowds. There not even getting half full attendance. Ah big greedy corporations have ruined another good thing.
1020389,dave524,2017-12-28 14:40:00,4508,Not sure if it is the game you are referring to but heard on news this morning an outdoor junior game is cancelled in Ottawa because it is too cold .

1020425,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-29 03:07:00,8243,"I don't follow the NHL any longer, that doesn't mean I don't like Hockey. I don't remember the exact year Copps Coliseum opened in the 80's, 86, 87 or 88 maybe, but I do know the first major event. Hamilton held the World Juniors. We took in at least  8 games including the final. I lived 3 blocks away. The Hammer was a rockin'.  If I'm not mistaken Canada won. Those guys are all retired old men now. What I do remember best was Shane Conlon.  He terrorized the Europeans and if I remember right Japan had a team in the tourney. There was a short little Japanese ref in the games and he could hardly skate. We razzed the Bejeezus out of the poor guy. The joke was I could skate better and  I couldn't skate for more than 5 minutes. That Conlon kid beat up anyone that dared skate on his ice and went after that Japanese ref when he gave him a game misconduct. A fight in international Hockey just didn't happen much back then unless between Canada and the USA. If the games weren't in Canada he would have been tossed from every game including that time when he chased this poor 5 foot nothing Japanese ref down the ice, he literally chased him. He should have been tossed for the entire tourney. Conlon came into a few bars downtown acting like Shane Conlon. He was lucky to get away virtually unharmed because he had to play. Good luck to Canada. Let's have a good clean tourney boys. Can't wait for the Canada/USA match up. Maybe not so clean for that one. "
1020433,misfish,2017-12-29 11:18:00,29133,"WOW, USA GOES DOWN 3-2 TO  SLOVAKIA  "
1020443,Rodbender,2017-12-29 16:45:00,1027,Can't wait for todays game too bad ticket sails suck hope they are better for todays game
1020454,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-29 20:31:00,10439,"HOLY MOLY!!!! Are these guys ever fast!!! It's like the video has been sped up!!! 45,000 tickets sold for today's game. Lots of peeps stuck in line at the border."
1020455,G.mech,2017-12-29 20:52:00,830,"The year was 1986, Soviet Union won gold, Canada got silver.  There was nobody named 'Conlon' on the team but I think you may be thinking of Shane Corson?  If so he was a pretty decent hockey player with some grit.  I remember him playing with Rob Probert for the Brantford Alexanders back then and it was pretty entertaining to say the least!"
1020456,misfish,2017-12-29 21:29:00,29133,Just turned it on. Had to work. They cant move on that 3 on 3 rink. STUPID.  
1020458,G.mech,2017-12-29 22:47:00,830,"It's an NHL size rink it just looks bad due to the camera angle.  What's bad is playing an important game in 4"" of snow."
1020460,misfish,2017-12-29 22:55:00,29133,Really ? WOW Looks like I could do 6 cross over steps as a D guy side to side. LOL
1020462,G.mech,2017-12-29 23:11:00,830,I thought the same thing but my kids corrected me>>>>>
1020465,Pikeslayer,2017-12-29 23:37:00,1443,2 selfish Canadian players cost Team Canada this win. They should be benched for the next game. Very disappointing ?
1020466,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-29 23:41:00,956,Good on the Americans for sticking in there.  Could of gone either way
1020467,misfish,2017-12-29 23:43:00,29133,I agree Simon.
1020468,John,2017-12-30 00:03:00,2956,Yep stupid undisciplined penalties!
1020526,misfish,2017-12-31 01:19:00,29133,WOW Look at all the empty seats.
