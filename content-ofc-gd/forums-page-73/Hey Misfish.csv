We walked out set up and didnt open the door til we were ready to leave. Even with the heater on full, the hut was frosting up still.  Finder battery was dieing quick. Sun came up,hut warming up , and battery coming to life again. Enjoyed seeing you again Paul. Enjoyed your tunes and your singing.  BTW Terry, Paul takes out more crap then you."
