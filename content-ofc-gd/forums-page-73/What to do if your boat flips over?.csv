1020459,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-29 22:51:00,956,"Hey guys.  I know were months away from throwing the boat in the water, but this is just something I've thought of and was hoping to get some of your expertise or better yet experience.  I have a 14' aluminum and have hit some choppy waters over the years.  Came close once, but somehow got lucky."
1020463,Cosmos,2017-12-29 23:13:00,588,Cant give you a good advise - i am trying to stay out of water if it's rough. When i am fishing alone - i always wear pfd with tether cable from my outboard attached to it. I hope other members can help.
1020464,OhioFisherman,2017-12-29 23:35:00,6623,"Don't go out if the water is cold if you're going to push your luck. Stay with the boat, it makes bodies easier to find."
1020469,Fisherman,2017-12-30 00:27:00,7201,"What the above said for sure.  Pay attention to marine weather forecasts, they sell cheap receiver radios.  Let someone know where you're going and return time.   If it's borderline bad,  I'll err on the side of smart.  I could tell you a story of a bunch, probably 6-7 boats that went out during the Owen Sound Spectacular about 6 years ago.  Flat calm sunny afternoon that turned into something like the perfect storm movie in a very short time.  Poo pooers that didn't believe the forecast."
1020483,Garnet,2017-12-30 11:43:00,2056,Buy a bigger boat.
1020491,SirCranksalot,2017-12-30 15:04:00,3291,I think the std advice is to cling to the boat. For this and other emergencies there are little waterproof cases you can get for a cell phone that can be hung around your neck or from a PFD.
1020493,DanD,2017-12-30 15:30:00,2223,That's good advice right there. Next would be to confirm that if the boat does flip or become swamped; it doesn't dive like a shovel to the bottom. If unsure add more flotation to the boat. Pods  Like these examples or you could easily make something along these lines yourself.  Dan.
1020498,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-30 17:22:00,956,Thanks guys.   I know about staying off choppy waters and all that safety stuff but i was just wondering if the boat does flip over is there a way to flip over if i get it to shore somehow.  I like the idea of putting some floats under the carpet to keep it upright instead of sinking to the bottom.
1020500,G.mech,2017-12-30 17:55:00,830,"Any relatively modern boat would have been constructed with secondary flotation as required by Transport Canada Regs.  Unless the foam or other material has been removed, the boat shouldn't sink even when fully swamped and carrying it's maximum load.   If the secondary flotation material was removed it should be replaced.  There really shouldn't be any need to add flotation if the original stuff is still there.

1020504,Fisherman,2017-12-30 19:03:00,7201,"If the boat is upside down, there's a pretty good chance there's a big air pocket helping it stay afloat too, just stay with it."
1020511,John Bacon,2017-12-30 20:48:00,3277,"The foam can also become water logged.  Especially if the boats is often stored at the dock.  Although, I have been told that the foam used in newer boats is more resistant to becoming water logged. 	My 1994 Alumacraft sank in 2008.  Prior to that, I did notice that a loose piece of foam in the bilge sank right to the bottom."
1020528,grimsbylander,2017-12-31 01:49:00,3016,Loosen the clamps on the outboard and let that sucker sink. Lol

1020559,grimsbylander,2017-12-31 17:37:00,3016,Lol! That was great....how did I not see that???!!
1020664,FloatnFly,2018-01-03 03:52:00,1640,"If possible, stay with the boat.  Always wear your pfd with a plastic whistle attached.  Always stay within view of shore, if your boat does go down, make your way to shore.  get some expanding foam pumped up under the seats for extra floatation. And if you want to get creative, pool noodles around the lip  waters can get rough just from boat traffic alone, can be dead calm wind, but rough waters.   Those that boat in the st Clair river can appreciate that."
1020667,Acountdeleted,2018-01-03 13:16:00,2562,Buy an E-Perb. (Electronic device. When it gets wet sends out an SOS with the exact GPS location to the local authorities)
1020677,irishfield,2018-01-03 15:48:00,26272,I still have about a dozen of these. $15 and the ride.. 
1020685,LeXXington,2018-01-03 19:33:00,1928,Far from shore stay with the boat .. flipping a boat in deep water is next to impossible.
