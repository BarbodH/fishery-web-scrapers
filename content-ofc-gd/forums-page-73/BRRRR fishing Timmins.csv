Lickmyarmpit was a great host. Him and his missus and I slaughtered the fish on day 1 out on a little mud flat in 12FOW. We were after pike/walleye/perch, and we pulled up all 3 species. I had my PB walley. Temperature was -15C by the time it turned dark. Wasn't too windy so it was comfortable just being outside. Lickmyarmpit brought up this beautiful pike. The next day was -16C but with a wicked wind. We forgot the scoop for the minnows and paid for it with burning hands. Different lake - man made by a mining company, to relocate the lake from across the road so they can mine the lake bottom. It was -36C with windchill. BRRRR. We caught only 1 pike. There were some light strikes that didn't stick. We called it after the icicles had formed all over everything. Timmins was cold. -32C without the windchill on some days. Those days, I stayed indoors. Beautiful scenery and 500 lakes in the neighbourhood. Gotta come back and fish it some more. Many thanks to Lickmyarmpit and company. The people are so friendly up here.  "
