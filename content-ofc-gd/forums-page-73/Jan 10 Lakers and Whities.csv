Got into a decent number of both, though it certainly wasnt fast and furious.  Marked a ton of fish in the 50ft range, but the shallower fish seemed to be biting better.  Not a hut to be seen where I was fishing and I love that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmtme7wVXL4&lc=z22odji5emr5jpzmxacdp435h032yb3dqfil1ti4ahlw03c010c"
1021055,Dutch01,2018-01-11 04:44:00,1431,That was fun to watch (except you losing your trout) - thanks.

1021090,AKRISONER,2018-01-11 18:00:00,5558,"watched cause i follow you on the grams...great vid...jealous of your knowledge of simcoe, you seem to have the lake on lock"
1021092,steverowbotham,2018-01-11 18:39:00,1800,"Definitely not on lock.  It is constantly changing.  I moved to Innisfil from Mississauga 23 years ago and have been fishing it ever since.  I saw the lake change with the zebra mussels, I saw it change when smelt and herring all but disappeared, I saw it change when gobies were introduced, I saw it change when herring made a come back.  The lake is in a constant state of change, and we as anglers need to adapt also to be successful.  It's not that I have it on lock, I'll be the first to tell you that there are a hundred guys out there that can catch em better, or have more knowledge of it.  I am just constantly experimenting and I think thats the best way to learn."
1021102,AKRISONER,2018-01-11 20:06:00,5558,I think that this is also something that I need to get better at. Its difficult to break old patterns when they worked before.
1021104,Dutch01,2018-01-11 20:48:00,1431,Same here....
