1020819,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-05 21:47:00,8243,"Found my password for OFC but don't like using sis in laws PC. Call me what you wish, I'm not freezing my corleones off. From Tallahassee to West Palm beach where we are right now is like comparing Sault St. Marie weather  to Niagara Falls, a big difference between northern FLA and southern FLA. No it isn't T Shirt weather, not yet, historically winters are getting colder here in FLA. Right now it's 60F and going into the mid 70's the beginning of the week. We disinvited ourselves from the New Years party at Uncle Donalds. No fishing so far, I blew my back out lifting the tongue of a boat  trailer out a few days before we left. I dare not get pounded in a boat for a bit.  I think I'm 33 not 63, even 53, big difference, like the opposite of 10 years and 20 years old. . Off to a camp on Little Deer Key Sunday. When I get a rod in my hands I'll report back, I can only lift a Rolling Rock so far. In the meantime put an all nighter on the fire and stay warm all."
