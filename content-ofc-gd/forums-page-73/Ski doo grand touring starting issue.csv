1020705,super dave,2018-01-04 16:30:00,323,Im not a sled person but my brother in law is having some issues.  Carb was cleaned and new gas.  It starts sometimes but wont stay running.  He was saying something about a des switch.   I know this isnt a lot of info but any thoughts?   Could it be des kill switch? I know there are some sled guys here so thought i would throw it out there.  Thanks
1020725,Joeytier,2018-01-04 22:09:00,3990,"'wont stay running' is kind of vague...how long will it stay running for before it dies, and does it idle well before sputtering out?"
1020748,buckhorn250,2018-01-05 11:14:00,85,The DES switch will not kill the motor if its not seated properly...you will hear a constant beep until its positioned properly. if the carbs were cleaned it could be a low idle setting. there is a knob on the center of the carb assembly that you can turn with your hand...start the machine and give it a turn and you will hear the revs increawe or decrease...try raising the idle revs a bit.
