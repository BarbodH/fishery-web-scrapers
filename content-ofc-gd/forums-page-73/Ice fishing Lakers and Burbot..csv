I had work that afternoon so only managed a couple of hours but fish were caught and a buddy turned up on his sled and came in for a chat which added to the fun. Was hoping to get a couple of trout for my neighbour's smoker, got one but it was a decent size, and the ling showed up in force which made for some action despite being a slow morning for lakers.
