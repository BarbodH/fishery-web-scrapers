I have eaten it before and consider it one of the best, it's just I did not know how to clean them properly, then I watched a Youtube video, it's actually very easy, slimy, smelly, but easy. Wanted to experiment beyond the poor man's lobster and beer batter options, although those are good too. Had the chance to get in the kitchen yesterday, and Jack was all over the idea of helping cooking and making a recipe video. So here goes............  Lemon Crusted Burbot on veggie spaghetti with a Moroccan chilli sauce.  "

1021286,Fang,2018-01-17 01:07:00,1330,That sweet chili sauce is a staple in my house. I put that on everything top uses as helping binder when making homemade burgers 1:1 As base brine for when I smoke trout Topping on scrambled eggs/ bacon weekend breakfast is absolute heaven
1021288,Acountdeleted,2018-01-17 01:56:00,2562,Yes! Was wondering if you kept any. That looks sooooo good.
1021291,manitoubass2,2018-01-17 02:36:00,11391,"Our grocery store had frig all for produce so I just improvised, made a few small changes but cooked the walleye exactly how you did the ling. I also made oven bannock too My hats off to you Simon! The fish is unreal good!  Everyone loved it.  I had no chilli sauce so I used franksredhot in mayo with dill lemon zest and mustard, amazing! Used the left over on a baked potato and it too was awesome!"
