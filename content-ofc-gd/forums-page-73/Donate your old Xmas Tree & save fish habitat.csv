1020849,BillM,2018-01-06 15:53:00,17367,"Now if we could only get the idiots who drop Xmas trees in the water before the ice hits to stop, lol."
1020851,manitoubass2,2018-01-06 16:31:00,11391,Two lakes here get hit hard with that bill  Drives me nuts. More than once I've hit buried Xmas trees with my sled. Not cool
1020852,BillM,2018-01-06 16:58:00,17367,"Happens on Simcoe all the time.  I see guys out there drilling holes, peaking down, moving 5ft and drilling again.   Seriously do you think there's a lack of perch in Simcoe that you need to drop Xmas trees down in order to provide cover?    Should be charged for that crap."
1020858,Rodbender,2018-01-06 19:54:00,1027,LOL one of my birding spots
1020915,AKRISONER,2018-01-08 15:50:00,5558," Are you saying some idiots are throwing christmas trees in the lake to make ""artifical"" structure and then going back and trying to find them come winter time?"

1020919,manitoubass2,2018-01-08 18:41:00,11391,"That's exactly it. Same with soft water too. Drop trees, mark a way point.  Idiots"
1020921,grimsbylander,2018-01-08 19:07:00,3016,"""Just make sure your tree doesn't have any decorations on it."" That was the line in the article that convinced me just how stupid people can be. LOL It's ok to sink a tree, just make sure you leave the lights on, it attracts more fish."
1020944,BillM,2018-01-09 05:30:00,17367,You bet.
1020963,manitoubass2,2018-01-09 18:30:00,11391,I'd have to clarify with MNR but I do believe it to be illegal bill
