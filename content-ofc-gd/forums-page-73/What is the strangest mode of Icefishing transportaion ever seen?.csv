A Horse, the size of a Moose without the horns, antlers, yep antlers, no horns on a Moose. I didn't stop to ask him if he rode the horse out or just led it. We thought about asking but didn't want to spook it with the machine. Plus I didn't think it such a good idea to share the ice with about 1000 pounds of flesh on it. I have a grainy 35MM pic of it somewhere deep in a box of other grainy old pictures. It looks like a dark spot on the foto, no zoom. That is one of the strangest things I have ever seen and I've seen some crazy stuff over the years. I would have been worried about the horse slipping on clear ice and breaking a leg, for sure, this guy wasn't I guess. Sitting by the pool guys in 77F weather waiting for the 2 Sisters that haven't seen one another much since April to get ready for dinner. I told them dinner was for 6 so we should be there by 7:30. Man I need more Sunscreen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm rubbing it in, how's it feel? I'll be back to reality sooner than I thought. I see it's +6 home and this weekend -15 when we land, say it ain't so. Again, can't get pics from phone to PC. It's my phone for sure. "

1021045,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-11 00:09:00,8243,"Yep, it could be the looser. When it comes to electronics ""operator error""  was generally what I wrote down in my lost time reports, then I came up with ""Faulty field device.""  I had many people I could blame it on back then, not anymore. I'm the guy that needs an electrician to change batteries in my flash lights. I had no less than 6 of 6 outlets upstairs that didn't worked since the day I wired them. One day they miraculously came to life, the day Ticha asked a friend when I was at work one day to do them right. I buy those crank lights now."
1021107,floater,2018-01-11 20:56:00,220,I was fishing Simcoe a few years back and I saw a home made helicopter land. Two guys got out. They had lawn chairs and everything else. They fished for two hours then off they went.
