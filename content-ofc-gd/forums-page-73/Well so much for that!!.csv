1021185,Moosebunk,2018-01-13 15:16:00,3970,"Thursdays windchill was -52C.  Fridays windchill was -54C.  School canceled for the kids because some children's faces will suffer frostbite just walking the few minutes to school.  Warmed up to about -40C something in the afternoon and while sitting in my office reviewing charts I look out the window and see a girl, mid 20's ish pull up on her skidoo.  Two kiddies on with her, she had to stand cause there was no space on the seat.  She's got a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, her face totally exposed with just the hood up and I'm thinking, EVER HARDCORE THAT CHICK! Today is breezy out.  Gonna warm up to a -40C windchill this afternoon.  It's my only day off to get out there but the skies are dreary.  Chased caribou last Saturday but the light was bad, the bous were fast and after a couple hours the sweat was starting to freeze.  Was invited to seal hunt at some point but exposed and standing still for hours out on the ocean at the floe edge would likely kill with these temperatures.  Looks like best option is a day of movies, internet, cooking stuff and snoozing.  Same for you Matt and everyone else.  The extremes man, they're tough to play with... except for the EVER HARDCORE THAT CHICK!"
1021187,Joeytier,2018-01-13 19:24:00,3990,"...on the plus side, we have an absolute buttload of ice now.  -29 tonight on bare ice.  Gonna need the auger extension on Nipissing before February this year if this keeps up.  Snow took a beating north of 17, but still enough to ride.  Never had much to begin with this year though, too cold to snow 90% of the time."
1021188,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-13 20:07:00,8243,"Geoff, PM me if you get a chance. I am having problems sending a PM for some reason."
1021189,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-13 20:13:00,8243,"That's cold, even cold enough for ""fog"" to freeze? Where are you working Mr. Bunker? I hope you aren't home. For a minute I thought you were home. It gets brutally cold along the Ottawa but that's even too cold for there. We had that camp near Westmeath years ago, urine would freeze before it hit the ground. Urincykles."
1021193,misfish,2018-01-13 21:50:00,29133,The lake harden up just nice. Easy walking. Not so easy fishing though. The ice was cracking and booming so loud. Would mark fish at times and then a BIG KABOOM. They gone. I was to at noon. 
1021194,chris.brock,2018-01-13 22:00:00,4053, Here's the Ontario snowmobile trail system map. The red trails are closed.      
1021212,GBW,2018-01-14 16:54:00,8460,PM sent
1021217,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-14 20:25:00,8243,"Thanks, G, got it."
1021129,muskymatt,2018-01-12 16:09:00,2608,"In 36 hrs it has gone from 2 ft of snow to bare trails, flooded lakes and flooded stream and rivers. I guess I can put the sled away for a while and no chance I'm going to go stand in shin deep water on the ice. What a bummer. I absolutely hate January thaws. Weatherman says its going to hit negative temps around noon here in eastern Ontario and will be -10 by 5pm. We will get a trace of snow but it will take lots more than a trace for the snowmobile trails to reopen. Stay safe folks, don't risk your life for a fish. Hope for winter to come back!!"
1021130,Terry,2018-01-12 16:12:00,14456,Already minus temps here and freezing rain lakes might be ok Sunday but I don’t think tomorrow will be a fishing day
1021132,chris.brock,2018-01-12 16:22:00,4053,"We hit record temps here in the GTA yesterday, 13.2C. It was a nice change but yeah, the snowmobile trails took a beating. Next weekend looks good for ice fishing. Things should freeze back up this week then comfortable temps on the weekend."
1021133,OhioFisherman,2018-01-12 16:24:00,6623,"It was like 60f here yesterday, the snow is gone, but only to make way for all the winter storm warnings out for today and overnite."
1021134,irishfield,2018-01-12 16:34:00,26272,-6C and snowing here in Ptang.. gonna be -15 by 6pm. We lost a good 2.5 feet of snow from Wednesday to 7am this morning.
1021136,grimsbylander,2018-01-12 16:59:00,3016,Snow is 100% gone and though I don't like what the flaw does to the ice fisherman and snowmobilers......YEAH!!!!!
1021139,misfish,2018-01-12 17:33:00,29133," OK  More fish for me Saturday. LOL All will be good Saturday buddy.  You know where I,ll be if your skating out."
1021141,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-12 18:11:00,8243,See that this AM +12 and tomorrow AM -12C. 24 degrees C is a huge drop in temperature. It should smooth out the ice for you die hards.
1021142,LeXXington,2018-01-12 18:20:00,1928,Just getting down to -0- in GTA  -9 tonight..
1021143,DJGeneral,2018-01-12 18:22:00,163,"More fish for both of us on Saturday Misfish, Im renting a hut with floyd hales ill keep an eye out for you if you're in my area "
1021148,irishfield,2018-01-12 18:55:00,26272,"Not sure on that Misfish... I've never seen so much water. My laneway.. in my own laneway, not the concession Rd.... culvert is full to the top with water, water has overflowed the other culvert inside the gate and is running across the end of my laneway, etc. Until that stops flowing under the insulation of the remaining snow it's gonna be a mess!"
1021151,misfish,2018-01-12 19:05:00,29133,I was out after work Wayne last night. It was not that bad out there. This north wind is going to firm it up real nice. If it hasn't already. Walk is not far. Fish are shallow. And my new korkers are so nice for walking on that stuff.  
1021152,misfish,2018-01-12 19:07:00,29133,You will need a satellite shot to find me. Not even close to there DJ.
1021153,Tjames09,2018-01-12 19:31:00,664,"the snowmobile trail in Kawartha Lakes is completely gone down to the dirt.  The lake looks really sketchy right now, Ill be careful the next time im out there"
1021156,DJGeneral,2018-01-12 19:53:00,163,"ah i see i think i know where might be, way more north of me im guessing its my first time with floyd hales, im pretty sure its good as Tim's right?"
1021158,Terry,2018-01-12 20:09:00,14456,a buddy was out from ibp on his atv  the water was up to his foot rest on the bike so thats like a foot of water
1021159,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-12 20:26:00,10439,Beauty day here!!! 
1021160,grimsbylander,2018-01-12 21:10:00,3016,"^^^^Freezing FOG!!! It's not enough to have freezing rain, freezing lakes, freezing feet, freezing ur azz off....even the dang fog freezes!!! lol"
1021161,ONbuckhunter,2018-01-12 21:51:00,39,The thaw is good for me.  Now the lakes don't have snow and will be perfect to access with atv by tomorrow aft.  Even sleds should be able to get around on the ice with the snow were getting now.  The bigger lakes may take a another day to tighten back up though.  Its a win for ice fisherman but not so much for snowmobilers.
1021162,misfish,2018-01-12 21:56:00,29133,"It,s a win win for us walkers."
1021163,DRIFTER_016,2018-01-12 22:03:00,10439,What? Y'all don't get any ice fog down thar?
1021164,GBW,2018-01-12 22:28:00,8460,This thaw flooded part of my basement yesterday.  Found a new crack in the foundation too.  Now to see if I can fix it outside before I rip apart the finished walls in the basement so we know where my fishing time is now going...
1021169,Raf,2018-01-12 22:51:00,3495,"we had it a couple of weeks back here in your ole stompin grounds of grand valley.  admittedly, i did a ""W TF"" when i read it."
1021170,SirCranksalot,2018-01-12 23:02:00,3291,Not too often and I sure do miss it!!!
1021176,Gallie,2018-01-13 01:05:00,1215,Ill be out tmw as well however it will be an exercise in caution to get out where i want to be. Im hoping for 8+” of good ice still
