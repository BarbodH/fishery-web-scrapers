Congrats to everyone who won an award, and especially to the guy who raised the most pledges, absolutely amazing! He will be getting spoiled by Dave Mercer thats forsure!  Thanks again and can't wait for next years event, its growing exponentially!"

717080,Acountdeleted,2012-07-23 02:47:00,2562,"Thanks to Dan and Ryan for hosting a truly amazing event. I had a blast and was able to spend the entire day fishing with my cousin which is somthing I always love as he and I both have the same goofy sense of humor.  Don't know why you hold the fish-a-thon on a lake with no fish though.  I kid I kid.  Seriously though, I'll be back next year, with hopefully more friends and family. Hats off to an awesome event."
717486,Rich,2012-07-24 16:21:00,3927,Can't wait for next year's event. Though I think next year I'll likely spend sitting on shore next to a cooler with a live worm out. lol
715186,Handlebarz,2012-07-17 02:29:00,3790,That's awesome I need some more stickers. Phil that looks like a big box you got there kudoes.
715261,Harrison,2012-07-17 12:31:00,2202,"I could use some stickers too guys.  I can send some out with my packages.  Cancer hits really close to home for me.  When I add up all cancer and the ""scares"" that turn out to be benign in my family and friends the numbers really add up.  I actually have a form of pre-cancer that was helped along by many hours in the boat without sunscreen or other protection over the years.  WEAR YOUR SUNSCREEN AND COVER UP.  Tans are not cool."
715332,nautifish,2012-07-17 14:53:00,1416,I Just recently lost a friend to Cancer 4 months ago we grew up together and known her most of my life. Lost two aunts to the Desease also...I will be there.

715371,Harrison,2012-07-17 17:01:00,2202," Already picked up and on route Will, thanks for the offer though.  However, there is a couple other ""thing"" that wouldn't fit.  If your around let me know, plus have something for ya too."

We're only days away and have had some amazing prizes donated from our sponsors to show their appreciation and support of what you're all doing here! We have most pledges awards this year for both the adult and youth divisions!    Don't forget - it's a Fishing marathon, but it's also a derby... we have awards for Big Fish (adults and kids) Big Bass and the Deer Creek Grand Slam!

715722,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-18 14:51:00,2690,"Just received a pretty cool idea for a pledge from one of my sponsors.  She has pledged $1 for each inch of the biggest fish that either myself, Juli or one of the boys catch.  Won't be the largest of pledges, but, creative for sure. We weren't planning on fishing too much this year, more of a working role, but with incentive like this might just have to shoot for a big carp, lol!!"
715760,fishnsled,2012-07-18 16:53:00,3520, So I need to bring my carp stuff eh?  Cool pledge Frankie! I just receive a pledge (on-line donation coming) from the island of Borneo from my friends that are sailing around the world.
715776,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-18 17:29:00,2690,"  Nice Will!!! She modified that pledge to make it even better.  Ten bucks flat rate + a dollar for every inch of our largest fish caught. See you on Saturday! Once we get everyone launched, Juli and I will head out in my Legend for a bit of fishing and ALOT of picture taking, lol!"
715850,danbouck,2012-07-18 21:10:00,4380,I received a big box from E-Tackle today as well as a box from Luremaking.com  I may need to take two trips to get everything down there!

715891,danbouck,2012-07-18 23:26:00,4380," Nope, I'll have the 2WD this year. Ryan should have his durango nearby."
715902,Handlebarz,2012-07-19 00:17:00,3790,Cool I will need a tow out as I have to bring the van the wife said she is not riding in the truck with out A/C.

716189,fishnsled,2012-07-19 20:41:00,3520, Is your brother fishing or working behind the scenes?
716231,HTHM,2012-07-19 23:17:00,4082,"That is the reason I am boatless, my tow vehicle is booked elsewhere.   :angry:  I am coming in the Jetta."
716256,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-20 00:57:00,2050, Derek is a punk - haha he's gone to a cottage on holidays as of this evening for a week!
716258,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-20 00:58:00,2050, I'm sure we can figure something out buddy!
713724,Acountdeleted,2012-07-11 15:35:00,2562,"Hi guys,  Ok so my girlfriend and I are offically signed up, as well as my cousin but I had no idea he was signing up and vice versa (which is kinda cool)  If someone could point me in the direction of a pledge sheet or e-mail me one ([email protected]) that would be awesome so I can get to work.  I have one question though, my girlfriend really wants to participate in this tournament but at the current moment is not able to move her right hand at all. The poor thing has been going through radiation for cancer in her hand and they warned her it may get to this, we just didn't realize it will be that bad. They say it should return to normal as her therapy finished today but if she's signed up and has collected donations and isn't able to hold a rod on the day of the tournament is it ok if she comes along in my boat and spectates? I'm pretty sure she would probabally still enjoy that, just not sure how things go.  Anyways both of us are really excited for this fish-a-thon. Can't wait to see everyone."
713729,danbouck,2012-07-11 15:54:00,4380, What's cool is your cousin in standing right beside me lol  Your girlfriend can spectate or sit on the beach. Lots of stuff to do!  I just emailed you a pledge sheet
713730,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-11 15:58:00,1107, Your GF is most certainly welcome to accompany you in the boat the tournament aspect of this event is very laid back .
713758,Acountdeleted,2012-07-11 17:15:00,2562,"  Thats awesome, thanks guys.  Dan, that just blew my mind. Hahaha."
713933,Rich,2012-07-12 03:02:00,3927,Are there any OFC'ers coming from simcoe area that could tow my boat or throw my car topper in their truck box/on roof rack?
713937,d_paluch,2012-07-12 03:47:00,343,"went to Deer Creek and fished for about 5 hours or so. Caught tonnes of good size rockbass, and 1 nice largie. The girlfriend caught some nice gills. Majority of fish were caught within a 2-2.5 hour span. Even caught a Goby...didn't know those stupid things were in this lake too...  Pics:      "
714145,danbouck,2012-07-13 00:22:00,4380,"Nice Gill and Bass!  I'll now be camping there all weekend  Rich - I'll see what I can do, maybe grab it this Saturday and leave it at Ryan's?"

714160,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-13 01:02:00,2690,"   Don't beat yourself up Mike. It will happen.  What you and the mrs. Did with your auction was amazing!  Really looking forward to seeing you both again. Juli will be hobbling around snapping mega pics, and my ""orders""from Dan Are dock duty, so I'll be helping get everyone launched in a timely manner. Fingers crossed for good weather, guess Ryan has been in the same boat as me this week, so we should both be healthy for the event!"
714162,danbouck,2012-07-13 01:07:00,4380, They did an amazing job with the auction but they also have one more thing coming that I am excited about! I am not spoiling it yet though

714512,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-14 15:33:00,2050,"Hey Guys - A couple quick copy and paste posts that I just put on the facebook page!  It's supposed to be high 20's to low 30's next saturday guys! Laurie Davidson from Dixie got Coke to Donate a bunch of pop and my Mother and Father in law pitched in and bought a bunch of water - But remember to bring drinks and stay hydrated throughout the day!    As usual we're going to be stuffing our faces! ;o) Big thanks do DanD of OFC and his wife for providing burgers and getting Ricco foods to hook us up with Hot Dogs! 200 of each! We have a special surprise for desert    and my mother-in-law and wife will be heading up the rest of our FEAST!    Dan Bouck has over 150 prizes at his place and they're still coming in thanks to all of our amazing friends and sponsors. He's worked tirelessly with them to make sure everybody goes home with something for their efforts! Prizes like this great aerated bait bucket from Erie Bait, Spiel's wicked rod, other fishing equipment, tools, tv's, gift certificates and weekend getaway's are all up for grabs! We'll be posting a prize thread to thank everybody who stepped up and donated something for our cause!    We ran down to the lake to go over a few things this morning and we're all set at the park.... For those wondering about the lake conditions... it's been dry and sunny so the lake is slow moving and CRYSTAL CLEAR. Weeds are coming in thick and so are the shiners... I don't know if the fish are eating them, but I wouldn't come armed without some sort of minnow style bait... Drop Shots, Waky Rigged Worms, Topwater frogs, Jigs, Crayfish Imitations, Minnow baits... Come armed and ready to catch the winning fish!!!  "
714611,fishnsled,2012-07-15 01:13:00,3520,Thanks for the update Ryan and to all who have been working their 's off make this the success that it will be. Looking forward to a great day!!

Like I said the genny is only on for a bit here at the camp, I’m on the Atawapiskat at Eddie’s camp right now, so I’ll keep it short. Ryan there’s 250 dogs and 200 burgers; you got too keep count man. Hope that the little freezer works out on site to keep drinks cold after the food’s been pulled out? Have fun everyone; I’m not missing next year’s event; not going to plan any form of trip around this date that’s for sure. Dan."

We'll have a couple of BBQ's on site if you bring anything that you'd like to cook up for lunch.

712464,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-07 14:23:00,2690,"Two weeks from today everyone! Juli, the boys and I are all set to pitch in where needed. Looking forward to seeing everyone again, as well as meeting some new participants."
712828,d_paluch,2012-07-09 01:55:00,343,"Going to be going to Deer Creek either Wednesday or Thursday of this week. If I feel ambitious enough I will post some pics of my fishing!  Hope its not as hot this year as it was last,  can't wait!!!!"
712831,d_paluch,2012-07-09 02:00:00,343,"also, I have been repping the fish-a-thon decal on my car for the past few weeks, will grab a pic of it tomorrow!"
712953,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-09 16:20:00,2050,"WHADDUP FOLKS?!?!?! I've been hybernating and by hybernating I mean I've been taking on more then I probably should right now but that's the way it goes.  Thankfully the Fish-A-Thon has become a group effort, headed by Dan Bouck who has truly taken this to a whole new level.  If it weren't for the efforts that all of you have put into this, both the folks who've publicly posted here and elsewhere, an those who've been in touch with Dan and I in the background this really wouldn't be able to happen.  Helping with this event has really put into perspective how many people are directly affected by this horrible desease and I really believe that the efforts you guys are putting forth will make a difference.  Like DanD said - it could be your loonie that makes the difference.  We've got new and old sponsors stepping up to the plate and doing their part, and Dan has been doing an exceptional job with the website and getting people signed up.   We've got posters up in a few local shops and are still taking participants and donation up until the event!!!   So if you or somebody you know are on the fence about taking part in the event as a participant or a sponsor please go for it - I promise you a REALLY fun time with family and friends and the cause is the icing on the cake!  It's never to late to take part - we had a man hear  about it on the radio the morning of the Fish-A-Thon last year and he showed up with his son with whatever donations he could wrangle up that morning.  This year they're joining us in full force!  I think that he took the time to rush out and get pledges that morning, spend the day making memories with his son, and teaching his son the importance of helping others is just as noble as those who have the ability to go out and get a thousand dollars in pledges.   Every penny truly counts, big or small, we want to see you out there!  Updates to follow right up until the big day!  Thanks Dan and everybody here for all you've done.  OUR event has become something more then any of us ever imagined.  Ciao for now, Ryan"
713081,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-09 20:57:00,2050,"Hey Guys,  Dixie Tackle in St. Thomas said that anybody who show's up at the shop with a pledge sheet will get a guaranteed pledge from them!  If you're looking for some pledges  and a great place to check out some tackle pop by and see Laurie and she'll hook you up!  She's always been a huge sponsor and a great friend to the Fish-A-Thon and everybody involved!  Last year she provided every kid at the event with a tackle filled back-pack!  51 st. Catharine St. St. Thomas, ON  Can't wait until the 21st!  Cheers, Ryan"
713284,Rich,2012-07-10 13:01:00,3927,"Got my dc season pass, been hitting it hard lately! Fishing is good, though those monster largies still evade me, plenty of smaller fish are readily willing to bite. Cant wait to see and hear about everyones interesting catches at the event!"

702566,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-04 01:47:00,1107, The trout are a mix of stocked fish and reident

705661,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-14 03:20:00,2690, Looking forward to seeing you and the family again Mike.

706113,fishnsled,2012-06-15 14:40:00,3520,"Great news Frankie! My campsite is booked and looking forward to a great weekend.  Just a thought. We have 8,074 members on the board, wouldn't it be nice if everyone threw in a buck or 2 for the cause. Now I know that will never happen - go ahead a prove me wrong!! I dare you!! But I encourage everyone here to find someone that is a member in your area that is involved in this event and drop off a loonie. (or more if you can, tax receipts are issued for donations of $20 or more.) It will give you a chance to meet someone new perhaps and help out this great cause. Better yet, sign up and come on out for the day."
706816,DanD,2012-06-18 13:57:00,2223,"Bump  I’ll be up in Beteau so I won’t be able to make it to the event; timing is not on my side. But it’s too good of a cause not to do something; so here’s my offering for the prize table. What boater wouldn’t have a higher comfort level knowing they have one of these tucked away in case of a dead battery? You can’t win it without showing up people; Ryan & Dan need our support, plus it sounds like a good time, with a free BBQ at the end of the day!  Dan. "
706929,Acountdeleted,2012-06-18 18:56:00,2562,"This event looks fantastic, and I love lakes where my kayak doesn't get swamped by gas motors. If I'm not going to my buddies cottage on Quinte that weekend I'll be coming with a guest (TBD if its the girlfriend or a buddy.) Just a question, I'll be trying to raise as much money as possible but I didn't see anywhere on the website, is there a minimum amount to be raised for the event to enter?"
706943,danbouck,2012-06-18 19:16:00,4380," There is no minimum to be raised, we trust that everyone will try their best and raise what they can. it is THE lake for kayaks!  When you know if you are coming or not go to http://www.fish-a-thon.com/registration.htm to sign up  "

707908,DanD,2012-06-21 11:13:00,2223,"Cancer has just put another notch in its belt. I lost my niece to stomach cancer yesterday. She was diagnosed a little less then 3 months ago and everything went down hill from there for her.  Below was taken from the Simcoe Reformer obits.  SKINNER, Stephanie (nee Berdan) - Of Port Dover, passed away at Juravinski Hospital, Hamilton on her 41st birthday, June 20, 2012, surrounded by her loving family. Much loved wife of Ronald. Devoted and proud mother of Sean and Shannon. Stephanie was a Child Welfare Supervisor for the Children's Aid Society. She had a wide circle of friends and co-workers that will miss her, but will hold special memories of her loving spirit. She was an inspiration to her family for her strength and courage. Friends are invited to meet with the family to share their memories of Stephanie on Friday, June 22, 2012 from 2 pm to 4 pm and 7 pm to 9 pm at THOMPSON WATERS FUNERAL HOME , 102 First Ave., Port Dover (519) 583-1530. A Service to Celebrate Stephanie's life will be held in the funeral home Chapel on Saturday, June 23, 2012 at 2 pm, followed by interment at Port Dover Cemetery. For those wishing, donations to the Canadian Cancer Society would be greatly appreciated. Online donations and/or condolences can be made at www.thompsonwatersfuneralhome.ca11472635   Her kids are 8 and 10 years old and this frigging disease took their mom from them on her birthday.  Maybe not the right place to post this or if it belongs anywhere on a fishing board; but its just another reminder of how important it is for all of us to pitch in however wherever we can and help beat this disease.  Thank you for the FISH-A-THON Ryan & Dan.  Dan."
707977,danbouck,2012-06-21 14:28:00,4380,So sorry to hear Dan

708084,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-21 20:41:00,2690,"Sorry to hear Dan, but, don't apologise for posting.  Let's all hope that events such as this eventually do put an end to this disease that takes so many of our friends and family. Just over a month everyone, time to start working on those pledges."
708105,DanD,2012-06-21 21:25:00,2223,  X2  You never know it might be your looney that broke cancer's back. Lets make this year's event the best one yet.  Proud to put my name on this thread!  Dan Durnez AKA Dand I'm a cancer victim without having cancer myself; are you?
708184,Handlebarz,2012-06-22 00:16:00,3790,Dan I agree with you i am to. Last summer it took my uncle Don short notice he lasted months after finding out. Dad lost his battle last november on the 20th. A amazing friend and kinda mentor to myself had a short battle that he lost two weeks after dad. Then June 4th my wife just lost her dad after a 7 day fight for his life with brain cancer he did not know about until may 26th.  So cancer can flip off anytime.  Dad always donated his time and efforts to the fight and I have been and will continue to do the same
709414,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-26 15:42:00,1107,less than a month away we have 60+ regestered particapants this year if you want to come out and help us raise money for Cancer research go to http://www.fish-a-thon.com/ and sign up this is a great day on the water and lots of fun for the kids with a free BBQ afterwards and lots of prizes for the particapants .

696806,The Urban Fisherman,2012-05-16 13:26:00,2050,"Hey Guys!  I'm going to keep it short this morning and maybe let a few of our amazing participants step in and post as well!  We'll add a whole bunch of photos, info and sponsorship links as this thread and planning of this years event unfolds.  First and foremost, I really have to mention something here.  I started this Fish-A-Thon with short notice and amazing support from many folks here on OFC and the first year exceeded my expectations.  Fish-A-Thon 2.0 almost didn't happen because of my schedule that summer and just my general lack of being able to balance everything going on my life.  Lucky for me a few good friends stepped in and gave me the shove I needed to make it happen - once again, thanks to everybody it was a great success.  After that a really good dude decided to step up to the plate and really take charge of this whole thing.  Sure he doesn't always catch the biggest fish in the world, but he does know how to take an idea and turn it into something HUGE.     I really want everybody to know that without Dan Bouck this event wouldn't be half of what it has become.  He's donated many hours of his personal time, worked selflessly on this and really deserves a big round of applause from everybody!  There's a ton of amazing people involved in this event, members here, sponsors, the list goes on and it just wouldn't happen without the amazing support with get from all of you!  This years event is scheduled for July 21st 2012 @ the Deer Creek Conservation Area near Langton, ON.  Pledges can be as small or large as people are willing to donate - every penny counts towards finding a cure for Cancer.  We've all lost to many friends and family members to this and it's about time we put cancer where it belongs... in the history books!  We've raised over $20,000 with your help and support and with any luck we'll be over $30,000 by July 21st 2012!  Please if you're interested in being a ""Fish-A-Thoner"", sponsoring the event or if you're just looking for more info, hop on over to the website that Dan has built and fire us an e-mail!  Thanks again to EVERYBODY - I can't wait for this years event - it's going to be an amazing time, with big fish, tons of prizes, great memories and we'll be FISHING for a cure.... it doesn't get any better then that!  Just to give you an idea of what goes on - I dug up Frank and Juli's photo journal from last year... you can see it via this link : http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55621&st=0&p=605806&hl=cancer&fromsearch=1entry605806  Ciao for now, Ryan  ps. For those who've participated in the past, feel free to post any pics or info here.  We're just a big group of friends putting on an amazing event.  You're all part of it and are more then welcome to take part here in this thread!"

696840,DanD,2012-05-16 15:20:00,2223,"Hey Ryan. I have that prize table donation I promised Dan Bouck and I plan on bringing it down to my trailer. I’ll be in Normandale (Hidden Valley camp) as of tomorrow till Monday and I don’t mind going for a ride to get away from the chores I’m suppose too do down there. You’re not far from Dear Creek from what I gather; if so send me a PM with your address and directions. If this weekend is not convenient no big deal I’ll keep the donation at the trailer until we can meet up?  We still haven’t pinned down the sponsor that wanted the letter; but if he doesn’t come through; Cathy and I will and that’s a promise. So you can forget about where the burgers and dogs are coming from; they’ll be in my freezer, waiting for you. Dan said something around 150-200 of each?  I’ll have to miss this year’s event; my one brother (another cancer sufferer) and I will be on route back from the Attawapiskat River and our week’s stay at Eddie’s camp. I wanted to be there this year and help out where I could but I'm not missing this trip with my brother; it mybe his last; frigging cancer.   Dan."
