717017,buckhorn250,2012-07-22 23:32:00,85,I started fishing in Upper buckhorn over 20 years ago...I remember targetting bass and catching walleye on a regular basis. Six years ago we bought a cottage on UB and have had great success with bass...but have yet to catch a single walleye. If Im honest I really dont target them but would have thought I would have hooked into at least one over the years. Also hearing alot from neighbours that the walleye levels are no were near where they once were.  Any comments or insights ?
