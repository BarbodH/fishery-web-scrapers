717334,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-24 01:04:00,2050,"The Fish-A-Thon has become a family tradition for us and my kids very much look forward to it each and every year.  That being said, as the case with many of our amazing volunteers we don't actually fish it anymore, but have an awesome time working as a team to make sure everything goes off well and that the group has a great day!  Friday night after we figured we were all ready for the big day a few of us sat around the fire and caught up with one another.  It was a great time spent with good friends and family -  times that I cherish most in life.  We were so busy just hangin out that nobody thought to stop and take a photo.  All we managed was a sneaky picture of Averie and Dan's boy Jacob passed out in the trailer together... I'd say I'm keepin' an eye on Jacob, but I'm pretty sure it's Averie that we have to worry about! lol    Sunday afternoon was our time to kick back and relax as a family!  We chilled out, did a little fishing, and just enjoyed some quite time at the lake.  I don't know how anyone can get through life without times like this!  I love every second of it - and it's less then 10 minutes down the road!        little rockie..             Luke and baby Claira fell asleep early so Averie and I went out for the evening bite... they were on pretty good but after 20 minutes a lightning storm moved in so mom was texting us to get the heck off the water! lol    the kiss   Mom gave me crap for not washing her face... but we just wanted to catch fish...    Safe from lightning in the distance I let hte kid fish from the dock for a couple more minutes   And it was finally time to call it an awesome, and very successful weekend!   Thanks again to everyone!  It's my favorite weekend of the year!  Cheers, Ryan"
