715835,ricardo,2012-07-18 20:21:00,26,I've caught 2 dozen worms this way the day before I went fishing and the worms still lasted me all day. After putting them in the fridge over night tho
715836,Christopheraaron,2012-07-18 20:23:00,3525,Maybe I'll do this more often then!
715855,aplumma,2012-07-18 21:21:00,6896,Be careful doing this in a neighborhood if you treat to large of an area the neighbors will call the police from all of the screaming noise the worms make from the soap burns....  Art
716009,Fish Farmer,2012-07-19 12:49:00,2234,"Can't say what Malcolm would charge now but in June a flat was $30.00. Did anyone call? With this drought, could be more?"
716013,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 12:54:00,3525,"Don't want to hijack this thread but does anyone have tips on catching bloodworms and sandworms out east, I want to try them for striped bass and pollock. I have a very large sand/mud flat in front of the cottage. I also want to try trapping eels, for the same purpose."
716051,G.mech,2012-07-19 14:20:00,830,I usually stop at Billy Bob's bait in North Bay on my way up so I don't have to worry about melting them during the trip.  He has flats for $45 and the size and quality of the worms is second to none.  Crappy worms really P me off especially when you buy a whole flat.  He is only about 300 yards west of Hwy 11 on Lakeshore Road.  I am going up next week so I just called to confirm and he has lots.
716052,Hooked,2012-07-19 14:22:00,891, I stopped by there the other day and he was charging $35.  Still a solid price for sure.  I'm picking up 2 flats at end of the month.

716074,Christopheraaron,2012-07-19 15:13:00,3525," That's really cool, and I know where there are walnut trees nearby!"
716227,ricardo,2012-07-19 23:00:00,26,That's a great video. Gunna try that.
716343,fisher,2012-07-20 11:45:00,451, Care to share where they may be?
716434,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 15:25:00,3525, Black market?
716471,fisher,2012-07-20 16:35:00,451,I wonder if the walnut method ruins the ground in any way?  Will it kill the grass if you were to do it on that?
716481,Christopheraaron,2012-07-20 16:59:00,3525,Just incase maybe don't pour it on the middle of your front lawn.
716510,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-20 18:13:00,336," Yea, go to the golf course and try it on the 18th green.  I don't think anybody would mind."
716880,express168,2012-07-22 14:02:00,327,"Just confirming what Hooked mentioned, I got a hold of Malcolm by phone and price is currently $35.00 per flat of 500 but prices could change by the time I need them in 3 weeks."
716881,dave524,2012-07-22 14:09:00,4508," Grass seems to be not affected but there is some herbicide properties to it , very little else like other species seedlings will sprout under a walnut tree cause of chemicals that wash off of them.  edit: this explains it  http://earthfriendlygardening.wordpress.com/2006/11/30/allelopathic-plants-natures-weedkillers/"
716896,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-22 14:33:00,336, Very cool Dave!  Thanks for the science lesson.
716897,Fish Farmer,2012-07-22 14:35:00,2234,"Thanks Hooked, Ill be needing some for the Harbor Front kids fishing day"
716912,Beans,2012-07-22 15:41:00,3339,Throwing this out there for anybody heading to Apsley or Bancroft...  The new tackle store in Bobcaygeon has a sign for worms $1.90 a dozen...  Just east of the four-way stop signs at the north end of town on the north side of Hwy 36...

717188,Christopheraaron,2012-07-23 18:23:00,3525,"Hey, just realized how lucky we are, striped bass fishing out here is mostly bait fishing, and so far I have yet to find more than 1 bait store, and that one doesn't even sell worms!"
715373,express168,2012-07-17 17:07:00,327,"I will be heading up to Lake Onaping for the week of Aug 11-18 and have heard that the bait pricing is pretty expensive. I stopped at Bills Baits on Hamilton mountain and they sell a half flat ( about 250 worms) for $30.00 or full flat ( about 500 worms) for $45.00. Sounds like a good price to me, anyone recommend anybody else in the area that sells flats or half flats for a decent price?"
715380,Ralph Field,2012-07-17 17:15:00,1018,"$45 for 500 worms seems like a good price ,compared to what you will pay up north. Cheaper still would be going out after a rain and picking them yourself, however with the lack of rain you may be better off buying them."
715396,adempsey,2012-07-17 17:48:00,1498,Paid $65 for a flat near Sault Ste. Marie a few weeks ago.  I'd say $45 is a good deal.
715398,Christopheraaron,2012-07-17 17:51:00,3525,"Don't bother trying to pick them up yourself, I watered my lawn at night for 3 hours straight the other night, when I went out to pick them up I saw nothing and when I started digging the ground was dry about 3 inches down!"
715407,Harrison,2012-07-17 18:09:00,2202, Isn't that supposed to be 7.6 cm to our youngsters today?
715411,Hooked,2012-07-17 18:13:00,891,"Since you live in the Creek, check out a guy who sells bait from his house.  I believe he supplies Grimsby Tackle....he's on Barton St just past Fruitland Rd on the left.  He has a sign out front and it's perhaps 3 houses east of Fruitland Rd.  Let me know how it goes, I'll need to pick up 2 flats soon."
715412,Spiel,2012-07-17 18:18:00,9065, His name is Malcolm but I'll be darned if I can locate his phone number.

715420,Hooked,2012-07-17 18:39:00,891," Thanks Chris, for the life of me I couldn't remember his name.  Think I might stop by there this evening.  I'll pm you his # if you can't find it."
715421,Spiel,2012-07-17 18:40:00,9065," Thanks Bud. I know Fish Farmer has it, if he happens to see this thread."
715482,express168,2012-07-17 20:30:00,327," I know where your talking about, I have seen the sign but have never stopped in. Thanks for the reminder, I will pass by there tomorrow and let you know."

715662,smally21,2012-07-18 12:18:00,993,i usually buy from the Stoney creek guy when heading up north. great value vs. little styrofoam containers. they are usually a great size.  and delicious.
715693,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-18 13:38:00,1022,"Could of sworn I saw signs on that Malcolm guys property in the past saying that a dozen was like 2.50 or 3$. I would assume a flat would not be cheap in that case. $45 sounds like a great deal, I payed $60 a couple weeks ago at Danny's Live Bait on New Mountain Rd. They were the fattest worms ever, although it was $50 last year . She sells half flats too for 30$. Lady claimed lack of rain is causing prices to increase, which makes sense.  Let us know where you find them cheapest, I'm hoping to sneak one more fishing trip past the wife this year ."
715694,moose,2012-07-18 13:42:00,266, I have two places in Toronto 30 cash for 500 worms
715704,Christopheraaron,2012-07-18 14:10:00,3525," Actually very rarely will rain affect night crawlers or trout worms or even red worms. Most people just buy some worms throw them in a dark container filled with dirt and compost and they're supposed to multiply like rabbits. So I doubt that the lack of rain is affecting her, more giving her a reason to up the prices."
715705,mercman,2012-07-18 14:17:00,7054,"This heat is affecting the prices of many things.The guy at the local fish market said crabs are going for 10-12 bucks a piece. I said ""Shake hands with a millionare"""
715711,UglyBug,2012-07-18 14:28:00,148,"Ok Paul, given this info your in the garage Friday night at my place  "
715750,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-18 16:22:00,1022, This was my impression after talking to her. I herd some places pick worms at golf courses because they are watered daily. Must be an agreement with the club.
715755,Pikeslayer,2012-07-18 16:41:00,1443,"   And while you're at it Paul, you can 'scratch' 9/27 off the list"
715768,smally21,2012-07-18 17:12:00,993,"hmmm, that is alot of worms to pick. the worms all look like clones and the big dirt tubs are all over the property....in this case."
715782,bassman87,2012-07-18 17:49:00,586,i know for certain the worms from dannys live bait are picked from farms in the stratford area
715821,ricardo,2012-07-18 19:49:00,26,I have been getting upset with the worm prices here in cambridge (3.50 to 4.50) so I've found a way to pick my own worms from the ground. First get a fairly large buck. I use I five gallon. Add a cup of dishsoap and fill the rest of the way with water. Spread it out over an area of dirty. I tend to look for places that get a lot of shade. Sit there with a bucket with topsoil and pick away. Works well. But like fishing the spots are hit or miss. Best of luck.
715833,Christopheraaron,2012-07-18 20:16:00,3525," This does work, I don't do it very often because I'm worried it will shorten the lifespan of the worms. Don't know if thats true though."
