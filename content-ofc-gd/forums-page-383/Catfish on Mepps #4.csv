716738,oates,2012-07-21 15:57:00,151,"Managed to bag a decent cat whilst fishing for bass in the river. I'm new to working Mepps spinners - caught pike and bass, is this a rarity or can this lure catch cats too? Mepps #4 silver"
716740,kickingfrog,2012-07-21 16:09:00,8333,Spinners are super versatile. Under rated and not sexy enough for some but they work for just about anything that swims.
716749,funfishing,2012-07-21 17:18:00,147,"Catfish do indeed hit spinners regularly. I caught one this week on a spoon too.  Funny you say that spinners are underrated, as many anglers I talk to say it's their #1 lure. I've caught more game fish on spinners than any other lure. 50c spinners from the dollar store to boot."
716763,hotsky,2012-07-21 20:52:00,400,"I caught a nice Bullhead with a Mepps Syclops, didn't expect that either."
716810,Lunatic,2012-07-22 01:30:00,536,"mepps #3 black fury catches everything. sm bass,lm bass,pike,rock bass,docks,logs,rocks,boats,weeds. i replace them often and just replaced one today"
716847,pikehunter,2012-07-22 10:05:00,1659,"Nope, not at all a rarity. Caught many cats and some big fiesty ones too in the Lower Grand on Mepps. My favourite, which is hard to find, is a dressed Brown Trout Mepps #4, tipped with a piece of worm was always my go to lure. Can't find it everywhere but Bass Pro and LeBarons usually had them in varous sizes."
716858,Live2fish85,2012-07-22 11:42:00,1633,I as well have caught catfish on Mepps.
716929,oates,2012-07-22 16:52:00,151,Heres a look at him with the gobbled up spinner! Good to know it can work on Cats! 
716930,oates,2012-07-22 16:54:00,151,"side question: I have caught cats between 1-5lb in the grand and thames. I heard there are 10lb ones in there or maybe more, is there a more proven technique to get the big guys or is it just rare to find them so big?"
716932,funfishing,2012-07-22 17:17:00,147,"Spinners work, but they are by no means the most consistent way to catch catfish, which you probably already know. Seems they will readily take just about any organic bait.  I would assume the bigger ones are coming upstream from Lake Erie to spawn."
717086,northernpike56,2012-07-23 03:12:00,717, AGREED
717241,bobowski,2012-07-23 20:27:00,360, A big chunk of sucker meat on a a circle hook. Use a heavy sinker and let it sit on the bottom. This is what most guys use on the grand for big channel cats. The fish in your pic is a bullhead catfish. They wont get much bigger then a couple of pounds.
717243,oates,2012-07-23 20:30:00,151," Cool! Bullheads are just smaller or do they look different. Which tastes better BTW? With most fish, I find the small ones taste better than monsters anyway. He did fight like a little Bull driving down into the water digging his head left/right."
717359,Cudz,2012-07-24 02:08:00,2652,We accidently got a 12 pounder and a 27 pound catfish on the same day ytolling a orange j-11 rapala in a river.  Was surprised at this. those are some pretty strong fish. I actually have some pics somewhere with the lure still in his mouth.
717367,oates,2012-07-24 02:24:00,151,"  12lb fish on the end of the line, serious bicep curl!"
717372,Cudz,2012-07-24 02:29:00,2652,Try a 27 pounder!! It was a load. Here is what a 27 pound catfish looks like with a J-11 in its mouth 
717374,oates,2012-07-24 02:32:00,151," ahh...my 10lb test may not win that one. I think i'd panic with that monster on the line, amazing catch.   "
717414,Cudz,2012-07-24 12:01:00,2652,It was caught on 10 pound test mono. 7ft rod.
717739,mrdylan,2012-07-25 15:31:00,111,   Mepps black fury and Blue Fox (3 or 4 diff ones) are my go to lures caught everything on em including many many Musky!!  Every spring these are what I buy as well as Gulp and jigs.
