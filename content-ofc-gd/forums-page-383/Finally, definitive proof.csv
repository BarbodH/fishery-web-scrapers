716065,lew,2012-07-19 15:04:00,12766,Years ago a woman came to see friends in our trailer park and brought her pet cougar along for the weekend. They went out to visit somewhere and left the cat tied to a tree on the front lawn.  My daughter was dozing on the beach getting a suntan   and woke up when the cougar started to lick her face after pulling free from his leash  The cat took off after that and was found later wandering thru backyards half way down the lake.  The cat was banned from the park permanently after that.
716069,kickingfrog,2012-07-19 15:07:00,8333," Forget the cat, ban the nutjob with the wild animal as a pet."
716075,lew,2012-07-19 15:13:00,12766, I agree Rob and we all complained to the park owner about it and that was the reason the cat was no longer allowed back.

When i mentioned it to a couple friends they said they could believe it but I might have seen a panther and not a cougar. REALLY, they told me that a few years before i saw this animal a train had derailed south of that area and it contained circus animals, some escaped and were never re captured.  then 2 years ago i was going into work for a midnight shift and one ran across the road in front of my truck and it was really motoring/.  I initially thought it was a bob cat or a wolf, but it was just too large and i haven't seen a wolf with a 4 foot tail. when i told my co-workers this one girl told me her husband was out by our place checking on some forest fire damage and there was a cougar tracking him just inside the tree line and he was quite scared. the mnr up here have had several reports of cougars, mine included, and they readily admit they are around."

717162,Roy,2012-07-23 16:25:00,13728, I'd say that this was seeded by someone who doesn't want anyone fishing the Otonabee for the next few weeks while he's there.

713135,danc,2012-07-09 22:38:00,4677,I know that I saw one in the 70's while Grouse hunting. Not 50 feet away from me. It took off down the trail away from me and cleared a fallen tree across the trail with a 15 foot high leap like it was nothing. I'm positive that it was a Cougar. Nobody can convince me otherwise.
713150,wallyboss,2012-07-09 23:05:00,1095,Maybe they tought it was declawed but a cougar's claws are retractable. They would've had to pull back on teh skin of teh paws to see the claws.
713155,Toad Hunter,2012-07-09 23:17:00,261,I would  think who ever examined the cat would know to check between the toes for claws but their are some real winners out there so who knows :s

He has a number of large cats, and one escaped in the last couple of years and was shot.  From what I understand he has a fairly good reputation for caring for these cats, but, there's no way this isn't going to look like one of his got out.  He says he would never declaw a cat....but could he have taken one in as a rescue/adoption? Or maybe the cat was in the area simply because of the other ones he has on his property.  Interesting story, and I'm curious to know what comes of it.  My parents are 14kms away, by road, from where this happened.  Many years ago their neighbours claimed to have witnessed a cougar drop out of a tree onto a pair of racoons on their porch."

715922,brkygetr,2012-07-19 01:17:00,425,"When I saw the headline in the paper I was relieved that finally the government would have to acknowledge that the cougar exists. After reading the article with it's possibilities of being an escaped cat I was almost saddened. As I understand it the cougar is an extripated species in Ontario according to the species at risk guidelines. I do not beleive that for a minute. Ontario is HUGE, just travel across it a few times a you will know what I mean. That journey spans a direct line across a signifigantly favourable habitat for the only animal that most of us will never see. That line has A LOT of bush above it that most of us will also never see. I have never seen a cougar or anything I would ever say was possibly a real big cat. That being said I have seen sign (tracks) of cats that I have had a hard time convincing myself was made by a Lynx.  Its unfortunate that this article states that the proof is in the pudding at the expense of a cat, wild or not.  As others have stated they have no doubt of what they have seen, I do not not question this. I have posted pics of critters on here that some have only tried to convince was something else. To each their own.  The day I see one I will let everyone know, I hope to hell I have camera!!!!  So....any pics???"

Yes, cougars are generally fearless (for good reason), but they're also incredibly elusive and avoid getting anywhere near humans.  Regardless, I wouldn't be calling some trigger happy smokies to my house in an instance like this.  If they weren't on site when the attack happened, then obviously they tracked the animal down after the fact."

Police shoot cougar after attack on German Shepherd  UTTERSON - Police shot a cougar over the weekend after it viciously attacked a German shepherd in Utterson, leaving it for dead.  Hearing her family dog Indy scream shortly before 10 p.m. on Saturday July 7, Middaugh Road resident Doreen Rick ran outside to find a cougar mauling the pet. The cougar didn’t budge when her grandson’s girlfriend attempted to scare it off.  “She let the air horn off and it didn’t affect it at all,” said Rick. “She screamed because he picked the dog up — and she’s a small white German shepherd — and dragged it across the lawn and just laid on him and chewed on him.”  The vicious attack left the dog clinging to life.  “It chewed on its head and went right down to the skull,” said Rick.  Rick phoned police while the attack was going on, who told her to stay indoors and to keep all windows and doors closed. The cougar then turned its attention to Rick’s other pets.  “It came right up to my screen after seeing my cats sitting in the window and started pacing,” she said. “We closed all our windows, took the cats away and it went back to the dog again.”  Rick said police arrived within minutes and shot the cougar. Even then, the animal did not go down easily.  “It took six shots to actually put it down,” said Rick.  On the morning of Monday, July 9, OPP Const. Maureen Tilson confirmed that officers had shot a cougar over the weekend, and that crews from the Ministry of Natural Resources were also called. The cougar was taken away by ministry crews after the shooting.  Although few other details were disclosed, Tilson said police would release an official statement on the incident later in the day.  Despite the attack, Indy proved more resilient that his attacker.  “The police were standing there, they had shot the cougar … they wanted to know what to do about the dog, and all of a sudden they said ‘oh my god he jumped up,’” said Rick. “He jumped up; he was dazed of course because he was all chewed in his head.”  Indy was taken to a local animal hospital, but in the end was also dispatched.  “We just had him put to sleep, because he was chewed right down to his skull above his ears and his head,” said Rick.  After the attack, Rick said both she and police approached the owner of Guha’s Tigers and Lions, an animal farm in Utterson that features wild cats. Rick was convinced that because the cougar is declawed, it did not come from the facility.  “It’s got nothing to do him with him whatsoever; he said I would not declaw a wild cat like that,” she said. “He said ‘I would never declaw a cat,’ he said that is cruel. He swears that it is not his cat.’”  The incident has left Rick both shocked and stunned. She said she hasn’t even seen a deer in the area for years.  “It wasn’t scared of people and we kept saying, what if there was a kid out there playing and not just a dog? That’s the scary thing,” she said.   ."

I can't say that I have ever SEEN a cougar but I can tell you that about a year ago we had something in the yard right next to ours at about 4:30 in the morning.  It was big, it wasn't a wolf, bear, or anything I had ever heard or seen before. I couldn't get a clear look at it because of some trees but the moon was bright enough to see that it was large and the sound it made was unlike anything else I have ever heard in the bush. I am convinced that it was a couger just by the way it was moving."
