I was planning on going out of Port Bruce tonight but all I know is to go out to 50ish FOW and start trolling. I have a few spoons to try out but im basicly shooting in the dark when it comes to anything else. Does anyone have any tips that could help me get a few in the boat?  Thanks  "

Most of the guys are fishing in 58 to 60 fow and set your riggers around 35 fow. If you are just using riggers, I would set one at 30 fow and the other at 35 and see what happens. You might even want to try around 40 fow. Go about 2.7 to 2.9 for speed on GPS, that is what I usually run. Good luck and let us know how you make out."
717593,Bassaholic,2012-07-24 22:03:00,74,Dont go to Burwell! The channel is very low and needs to be dredged. Was there about a week ago and got stuck on our way out!
717594,Woodsman,2012-07-24 22:09:00,1286,Use cheaters on your lines that are off your downriggers. Leadcore and/dipsy's also help add to the spread.
