Does anyone target them in the middle of the summer?  Or even late fall?  I have a lake that has whitefish.  It's a big lake, lots of deep water (up to 400-feet), lots of shoals, ledges, humps, deep flats.  I'd like to try and find some of these tasty critters, but would like to try and narrow the search down a bit.  Where do they go in the summer?  Keep in mind, this is also a lake where even winter and early spring whitefish fishing isn't part of the tradition, so there aren't any well established whitefish grounds from which to start searching.  I also assume the same baits in the winter and spring would apply in the summer?"
