713914,Gregoire,2012-07-12 01:46:00,1397,"I'm heading off to LOTW tomorrow with cowanjo for a week of Musky fishing. We will be doing the Musky Hunter University of Esox. We are going to try to get there a day early to do some pre-fishing, which will make for a long drive tomorrow, but I think adrenaline will keep us up. I cannot remember the last time I was so excited for something. It takes me back to my football days. Tomorrow is like the first day of a road trip. Riding the bus all day, staying in a hotel along the way, getting ready for the big game. I still have a bit of packing to do, but the amount of musky stuff I have is unreal. I definitely will be doing a tackle purge when I get back. Anyone looking for some musky rods and reels, plus a wide assortment of baits, keep your eyes peeled to the classified forums at the end of the month. I have decided that I will be selling the stuff that I am not using."

713929,Joeytier,2012-07-12 02:40:00,3990,That trip will certainly be a good way to figure out what musky stuff you need and what stuff you can part with...
