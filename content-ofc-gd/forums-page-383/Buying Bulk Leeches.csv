717544,Ben_Daniels,2012-07-24 19:44:00,435,I'm heading up to a friends cottage a little north of Tweed next week. Last time I was up there leeches were really expensive. Does anyone know where I can buy leeches in bulk for a decent price somehwere between Toronto and Tweed? Any help would be appreciated!  -Ben
