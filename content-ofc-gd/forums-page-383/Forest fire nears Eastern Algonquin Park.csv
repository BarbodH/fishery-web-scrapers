717169,Luke V.,2012-07-23 16:51:00,286,Is there anychance you found a map of where the fire is and where it is headed? My parents are in AP right now and and pretty close to that. My cousins are staying in radiant lake this week aswell. I have no way to contact them either   EDIT: Further investigation shows me they should be fine. About 40km from where they are staying.  Thanks for the link tho
717232,Dozer,2012-07-23 20:12:00,896,"Yikes, theres been a fire ban for quite sometime around there.  We are situated 1 hour south from there, had the police and fire fighters drive up to the cottage a couple weeks back because someone reported a campfire.  Pray for rain, water levels are lowest I've seen in years, the grass is dead, the well is running very low, plants are starving for water.  Its been a very hard summer...  Hopefully these thunderstorms bring lots of rain, we need it"
717294,Broker,2012-07-23 22:31:00,482,"In AP last 2 weeks where they had a ""fire restriction"" where you could only have it between 7-10 pm. I thought it was kind of silly to have it partially banned imo. On the last day we were there they fully banned fires."
717496,Dozer,2012-07-24 17:03:00,896,Reports are saying they are out
717508,kickingfrog,2012-07-24 17:24:00,8333,That's good. Hopefully Monday's storms didn't start new ones.
