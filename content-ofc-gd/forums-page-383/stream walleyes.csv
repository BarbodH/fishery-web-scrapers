Anyway, went up this long bay and right to the mouth of a stream that was rushing down into the end of the long bay.  I nosed my aluminum boat right up into the stream where there was about 2 to 3 feet of water.  Wham....the walleye were hitting like they were brook trout.  I had to put some back because in my area, I can keep only the ones that are 32 to 47 cm long.  This same thing happened a few years ago but did not happen last year.  It was late afternoon but the sun was high.  The trees are full and tall on each side of the stream so there was lots of shade.  If there was a way to fish from the bank, I would try that because I'm sure that my boat did spook some walleyes.  So if you see any streams dumping into your walleye lake, it is worth a few minutes to explore well up into the stream."

716868,Billy Bob,2012-07-22 13:04:00,5865,Walleyes LOVE Current.......
716871,Rod Caster,2012-07-22 13:08:00,5784,"I've seen walleye doing this in the late spring, chasing the baitfish into the shallow creeks. Only once have I caught walleye in a small stream, mid-summer. Very cool to see."
716933,tb4me,2012-07-22 17:27:00,3295,Thats the secret to my sucess..I have a hydro outlet right at the end of my dock. On the Trent river.I just anchor and jig the back of my boat..Its so easy its like taking candy from a baby..The water levels are low now and the hydro output is off ..I have to work 12 feet of water in the weed lines to get them them now..I find that once dialed in walleye are almost too easy to get..but they are good eats!
716953,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 19:10:00,4661,  Well your a lucky man.... I catch a LOT of walleyes and I have plenty of days were I have to work hard for my fish.... Some days it seems like you can't do anything wrong... Other days are pretty humbling....
