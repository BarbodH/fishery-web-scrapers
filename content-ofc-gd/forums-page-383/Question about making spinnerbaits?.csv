716991,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-22 21:57:00,166,Was out at a garage sale and came across a bunch of lure making stuff for $5 so I decided to grab it. Just looking for somebody to tell me what I have here and if any of it is useable. If anyone has a good link to a page about making spinners or lures that would be great too!  Heres some pics of what ive got...  All the colourful things are sheets of rubber legs I believe     What are the little springs for?             Thanks
716998,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-22 22:14:00,166," Forgot to mention, it came with a small cardboard box of spinnerblades, but the skirts are all kinda busted or ugly, so gonna cut em off and start again. probably have 15 spinnerblades to work with. What do those blades and stuff cost new?"
717034,cheaptackle,2012-07-23 00:29:00,849,Go to luremaking.com for info on both the items you STOLE ($5.00 is an incredibly great buy!) and how to use them.  Should find everything you need to know there.  Have fun!  (don't forget to figure out how much you saved!)  Michael

717063,kickingfrog,2012-07-23 02:10:00,8333, Never heard of it.
717069,cheaptackle,2012-07-23 02:21:00,849,"No, he should check out a .com site that deals in lure making!"
717076,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-23 02:43:00,166,"It seems the general consensus is that I should check out luremaking.com, so I will do that, thanks a lot guys"
717085,DundasSteelheader,2012-07-23 03:11:00,166,"without counting everything precisely, which would take forever, (lost count around 300 colorado blades and 100 willowleaf blades) it seems that the total of the stuff would be like $50-60. I didn't factor in the skirt sheets because it seems they have changed the style and the guy I got the stuff off of made baits a long time ago. There are about 1000 sheets (takes 1 or 2 sheets to make a good skirt) in 15 colours. No idea of the value of those. Thanks again to everyone who replied"
717103,singingdog,2012-07-23 10:34:00,1047,"Use the springs as spacer to separate other components on the wire. If the skirt material is the old ""living rubber"" material, it would be great for making jig skirts. Some pretty funky colours in that mix."
