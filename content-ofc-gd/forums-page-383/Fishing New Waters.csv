717184,UglyBug,2012-07-23 18:10:00,148,The gloves were for the fish not me. Pauls net was small  and I could not get a clean hold of the fish to remove the hooks. I did not want to damage the fish by letting it flop around on the floor  thus the gloves. So a saved fish is worth the ragging.   
717185,UglyBug,2012-07-23 18:12:00,148,"You are correct if you have the regualr style vests in the boat you are not required to wear them, however I have no idea why you wouldn't. just like seat belts. If you need them and your not wearing them its to late. I always buckle up and always wear mine.     "

716940,mercman,2012-07-22 18:07:00,7054,"My Brother and I decided to hit some unfamilliar waters on the nearby St Lawerence River.We chose a spot ""near"" Morrisburg and headed out yesterday at 5am. I recently added Navionics to my Humminbird and we launched the boat, and scanned the map for what our experience told us should hold fish.We new it was going to be a long morning, and we tried tubes, jigs, plastics, and trolling.We were out for smallies or walleye, what ever we could find.We planned to be off the water around 1PM, to avoid the biggest heat.By 7am, we were taking off the sweaters and long pants, and settleing down in shorts and our lucky matching,fishing shirts About 2 hours into it, my Brother hooked into this 8 lb Beauty of a Pike.It totally destroyed the Rapala we had been using for the Smallies. I have never seen a lure be destroyed like that before. Ripped the tail hook out, all the way up the center to the middle treble.Check out the bite marks on the side of this fish.I can just imagine the beast that tried to have it for lunch  Then nothing for 3 hours Finally, just as we were getting frustrated, i took out my Cell.Brian asked what the heck i was doing, and i said Watch this Got Musky Mike on the phone, Told him where we were and he said you see that ------- due west of your position on GPS? I said yup, sure do. He said go there, wait till you see the depth go sharply from --to-- feet, and start trolling in the current,with what we use for walleye. 10 Minutes later i had this 5lber on . We weighed it.It was a hog.I am a big dude, and my arms are not extended, and it was as wide as me   I guess sometimes, its not what you know, its who you know Thanks for the tip Mike. You saved our day out there."
716952,lew,2012-07-22 19:10:00,12766," Sheesh Paul, 1/2 the fun of fishing new water is figuring it out, finding the structure and what the fish are looking for.  If your gonna call a buddy for help as soon as you can't find a fish, you may as well sell your sonar and call a seafood distributor and order some fish for delivery   :lol:"
716954,spincast,2012-07-22 19:18:00,3279,nice fish. there Merc. Looks like you might want to troll for some big muskie where bro caught the pike?
716955,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 19:19:00,4661,"  It's actually a super tough area they were in... Dangerous rocks... Deep structure... The flooded areas of the seaway are a whole different beast because a lot of the stucture under water is man made and whatever isn't is still ""young"" and hasn't been shaped by the current as much as non flooded areas...  Most guys I know there target walleye in 80 feet of water... It's weird....     Glad my advice helped Paul... Hopefully you get to fish the other area I told you about... Loads of fish there..."
716956,Pikeslayer,2012-07-22 19:20:00,1443,"Paul, how many times do you need to be told? CLIP YOUR PFD  ps. Check your pm"
716961,Rod Caster,2012-07-22 19:53:00,5784,aww brothers wearing matching fishing shirts  That bass is a football!!
716962,UglyBug,2012-07-22 19:54:00,148,"It was a fun day for sure thanks  Mike. It's actually a different type of fishing than I usually do so, even tho the numbers were low it was some fun trying something new with my brother. As time goes on we can do one thing, drift apart or take up fishing together   I choose fishing  As a side note, if you only have PFD style life vests on board you MUST wear them to be legal. I carry both in my boat and leave it up to my partner to choose if they want them one when fishing, when I fish alone they are always on and clipped    when main motor is running everyone vests up.  A slow day fishing is better than a day at work... Who knows what week end will bring  Cheers and enjoy yourselves on the water with those who mean something to you"
716963,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 19:58:00,4661,I wanna know where you got that pike...  I wanna go find the musky that tried to eat it...
716964,UglyBug,2012-07-22 19:58:00,148,
716965,UglyBug,2012-07-22 20:02:00,148,Let's just say we weren't Kansas any more   Paul had trouble seeing the red line on the GPS    give him a shout he will give you the area  
716966,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 20:02:00,8333,Hey some of us are a bit squeamish.  How about a warning for ugly shirt pairings in the tag line?
716967,UglyBug,2012-07-22 20:06:00,148,Hey your just jealous that you can't look this good.. 
716968,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 20:08:00,8333,  I'm just thankful the fish were big enough to cover most of the pattern.
716969,UglyBug,2012-07-22 20:09:00,148,Me too! 
716971,mercman,2012-07-22 20:13:00,7054,  I'm too bloody fluffy !!!!!
716973,UglyBug,2012-07-22 20:16:00,148,Fluffy is that what they call if now   Me too  
716975,mercman,2012-07-22 20:20:00,7054,"  Like Brian said, as far as i can tell, we caught it on the Americain side, (they should make that red line thicker so geezers like me can see em LOL) You know that religious island?? on the shoreline south of that island is where he was. As soon as i realized we were in the states, we booted it back across that little red line"
716986,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 21:28:00,4661,  Gotcha...  Been cut off over there before...
716994,BillM,2012-07-22 22:03:00,17367,"I doubt something tried to eat that pike, most likely spawning wounds."
716996,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 22:07:00,4661, I had a musky grab a 5 pound walleye a couple weeks back... So a 6 pound pike being hit by one doesn't sound out of the norm to me...
717151,mercman,2012-07-23 15:46:00,7054,The fish was marked on both sides like that.Seems like a good assumption that something grabbed it.
717166,Roy,2012-07-23 16:31:00,13728," Look at it carefully, Mike. Those marks were done by a Honda 9.9, 4 stroke kicker."
717179,mercman,2012-07-23 17:43:00,7054, Hey Sin....  No comment on the gloves ???  I think it may be hereditary:w00t:
717180,Leecher,2012-07-23 17:45:00,7832,Good   time Paul & Bro    That's what it's all about
717183,mercman,2012-07-23 18:01:00,7054,"LOL !!!!! Like i said, since he is my brother, it must be hereditary  :rofl2:"
