717848,FishAbout,2012-07-25 22:48:00,106,My parents will be retiring next summer and want to put a trailer up north at a campground or lodge for the summers.  Up to 3-4 hours north of North Bay would be fine.  There not expecting great fishing but would be nice to able to go out and catch a few walleye for supper when wanting to.  Pike and walleye lakes are what they are looking for.  Lake trout in the lake would be a bonus though. If anyone knows of any good places that you would recommend it would be great.  If you want you can just PM me.  Thanks Justin
