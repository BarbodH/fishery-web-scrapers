717825,nautifish,2012-07-25 21:08:00,1416,Good afternoon Everyone We didn't have as many teams out this year. This was due to the water conditions and bad pre-fishing. The anglers that did come out braved the wind and waves. A thank you goes out to all the anglers who participated. We had 35 teams entered.
