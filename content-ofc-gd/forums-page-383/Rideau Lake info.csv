The area around Rideau Ferry is not all that deep and we have weeds just about everywhere.   Rubber worm and a 1/8 oz weight and just jig as we move across the weeds.   Typically have good luck with this approach.  There are some rocky shoals around and great for smallies - and we have caught some nice sized ones.  Large/Small, we can get some in the 3-5 pound range.  Don't forget some topwaters.  Early am and late evening, we have a blast with them over the weeds.  We were on the Rideau last September and brought a couple nice sized one back for some fresh fish."
