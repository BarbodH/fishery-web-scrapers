717140,Jarfish,2012-07-23 15:06:00,20,Hey guys!  I'm in the market for a new fish finder and I'm wondering if you have any suggestions. I do mainly deep water fishing for salmon and rainbow in the Collingwood area so depths are pretty much from 100ft in summer to around 10ish in spring and fall for flat lining  and I dont think I need a DSI or SI just a plain old 2d I think will be fine. I'm only really looking to spend around 200.  I've been looking at the  Lowrance Mark-5 http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Mark5x-Fishfinder/product/10215747/143070  Humminbird 570 Sonar http://www.basspro.com/Humminbird-570-Sonar-Fishfinder/product/53521700/249833  Lowrance Mark-4 fishfinder/chartplotter (If I can get Canadian waters on it) http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Mark4-Fishfinder/Chartplotter/product/11090805011714/247264  and maybe the Lowrance mark-4x Colour Fishfinder (still dont know how great Colour is) http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Elite4x-Color-Fishfinder/product/11090805011713/247263  Also I`ll be using it sometimes with my Gramps who has been using a 2d greyscale fishfinder with Fish ID for as long as I can remember so hes not great at learning new technology and I want him to enjoy it as much as I will. And I`m leaning towards a bigger screen size for his eyes also.  I`ve looked around other sites at reviews and what not but I want to know your guys opinion!  Thanks alot  Jake

You can run it in a basic AUTO mode, it sets all the parameters for you, or you can choose an advanced set up. Which allows you to set all of its parameters. I have found that its really good at finding the depths of the lake, but its hard to distinguish schoals and structure from weeds and sand bars etc.  But all being said, for less than 200 taxes in, you cant really beat it.

717146,dave524,2012-07-23 15:22:00,4508,"I'd upgrade the Lowrance Mark 5 to the pro version for more power in your deep water application, would still be under 2 bills.  http://www.basspro.com/Lowrance-Mark5x-Pro-Fishfinder/product/10215765/48135"
717154,NAW,2012-07-23 15:57:00,4022,I run the 570.  No complaints.
717155,Jarfish,2012-07-23 16:00:00,20,Thanks for the quick reply guys! Dave I was looking at the Mark 5 pro but the lower review score kind of scared me off..Have you had any experience with this unit?
717157,dave524,2012-07-23 16:04:00,4508," No, is it not the same unit except for the power?"
717159,Jarfish,2012-07-23 16:09:00,20,"It looks To me like the same unit but the pro has a 3.3 score, while the regular has 4.2 so who knows?"
717324,Joeytier,2012-07-24 00:35:00,3990,"From your choices I'd choose the 'bird for sure!, but for all the deepwater fishing, I'd seriously reccomend you upgrade to a slightly higher-end Lowrance."
