716788,spincast,2012-07-21 23:36:00,3279,"Couldnt make the Fish a thon today due to the usual commitments - but they were over by 11:00 so decided, after the let down of Friday's weather cancelling the scheduled  meet-limey-and-show-him-Lake-O- fishing day I was in serious fishin' withdrawal. The web showed a short window of low wave action off Lake E this afternoon so decided to go for it., Haven't hit P Burwell all year. 1:00 by the time we're in 58FOW - best time of day for fishin walleyes as we all know an hour and half into it and we have 2 knock offs, and G has a sheepie. the winds start to pick up from the west and with them, the reports of fish being bagged on the radio About 15 minutes before we pull up and I notice the dispey rod twitch - twice - then nothing, The winds were starting to pick up so I put it down to boat bounce When I go to pull in the dispey I whip it to make the dispey release. Weight.  I pull again. Weight. Thinking - well, its a new dispey, maybe I tightened the release screw too much and now have to fight the dispey the whole 250 ft in? I felt for headhakes, just in case - but nothing. So, I start the pull, raise, reel; pulll, raise , reel routine. you can do that a lot with 250 foot out. About 30 foot from the boat, all of a sudden a flash of gold behind the dispey - ""G GET THE NET!"" Then a walleye gob opened wide broaches the surface  The poor thing was too tired to be revived. Normally I would never bring one this big home.      measured 27 inches and was FAT. Chris - I will send the team 7 passport photo through shortly.   "

716960,Rod Caster,2012-07-22 19:49:00,5784,That's a BIG walleye!! SOunds like it fought like a wet-sock though haha.
717006,spincast,2012-07-22 22:34:00,3279,"  yeah, pretty good description Chad - at least three times I thought to myself ""could this be a fish? Give me something to say you're a fish"" Absolutley nothing till he came to the top, and then a couple hearted head shakes. When he hit ( assuming those twitches were hits) he didnt even change the angle of the rod - I watched it as I almost yanked the rod out of the holder on the twitches.  Can almost imagine him swimming along whistling  "" and talking like Homer -"" hmmmm perch snack.""  If a 27 inch bow or salmon that fat had hit that the rod would have been a-rockin and the drag a-clickin."
717047,zamboniwaterboy,2012-07-23 01:26:00,126,"Rick Nice fish!  They are all that big out there.  Next time you go down instead of Burwell go a little further west to Port Bruce and give Greg at North Erie Marina a try.  He and his staff are truly awesome...$10 launch and the get wet not you, $5/scoop of minnows for mega sized perch, usually get 3 dozen minnows/scoop. Have not been down there yet.  Maybe 2nd week of August!  http://www.weblocal.ca/north-erie-marina-trailer-park-ltd-aylmer-on.html  Michael"
717050,spinnerbaitking,2012-07-23 01:46:00,1622,Nice looking Walleye & a big Smile to go with it Tight Lines SBK
717141,johnnyb,2012-07-23 15:06:00,3413,"Very nice surprise there!  I remember reading one of the guys post on here that they loosen the drag (and of course leave the clicker on) so that you are hearing about one click every 5 seconds.  If the clicking speeds up at all, reel in the walleye.  So weird that they can hit a moving lure that gently"
717283,spincast,2012-07-23 22:03:00,3279,"  interesting idea - may have to try that next time out. I'm used to  setting it so that a salmon or bow will be able to drag it and still set the hook. Could make hooking a 'bow up a lot more challenging? But hey - worth a try, thanks"
