717785,Hooked,2012-07-25 18:57:00,891,Doing my annual trip to Rice Lake soon and was hoping for some walleye\pickeral updates.  How about the water visibility?  I know when I was there last year the water was pretty muddy the entire 2 weeks I was there and fishing wasn't the greatest.  Not that I'm complaining or anything.

When the weeds got too thick, pick up the other rod and start rippin the jig through....weeds clear up...switch back to the crank.  Good luck, and make sure to post a report for all us pic-hungry lurkers"
