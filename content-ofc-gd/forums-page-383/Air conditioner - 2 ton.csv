717297,fisher,2012-07-23 22:49:00,451,"My dad's AC in his house went and it's pretty old.  Can anyone tell me what is a fair price on a new unit about 2 ton, installed?  He is in Vaughan."
717306,Ralph Field,2012-07-23 23:51:00,1018,My guess would be between $2500 and $3000.
717321,pylon,2012-07-24 00:29:00,68,Two ton enough ? One ton per thousand square feet of house. Staff mans about right on price depending in how old the furnace is ( us it adaptable to a newer air unit )
717360,NANUK,2012-07-24 02:08:00,797," That's about right in the middle of this summer's heat wave, less in the fall or early spring Things always break when needed the most"
717363,gogu392,2012-07-24 02:12:00,142,"Just replaced at my house. 2 tons, York brand $2300 include tax. Works very fine. Using the new refrigerant R401 (Ecological)."
717408,fisher,2012-07-24 11:35:00,451,"Just had solmeone come by last night and was  highly recommended by a friend.  Getting a 2.5 ton Goodman AC unit for $1800 plus tax (includes install).  I read up on some reviews and Goodman is owned by Amana and as with anything, there were some good and some bad review - in this case, there were many more good reviews than bad.  Anyone have experience with them?"
717445,gogu392,2012-07-24 14:31:00,142," I have the furnace Goodman. A decent product for that price. Best brands: Carrier, Lenox, Trane (Very expensive if eficiency is high). Goodman, York not so expensive but it will do the job.  IMO is not worht to spend more than 2k on a AC unit that has to be replace again in 10/15 years, but if your walet if fat go and spin the economy/crisis. Same with the cars, some buy cars of 50k-100k some just 10-20k. Is a matter of taste and power. Ultimaley all of them in 10-15 years become rusted cans in a crashing station. Have fum."
717716,ryan,2012-07-25 13:03:00,19,"  $1650 plus tax for a Keeprite or Goodman 2 ton installed. What is the house size, age and window condition?  http://www.thermalcomfortheat.com/specials--promotions.html"
717718,scugpg,2012-07-25 13:35:00,1373,"check around for rebates etc, likely looking at 2000-3000 for a good unit installed.  I would suggest you buy a reputable brand and ensure that the warranty is a manufacturers P&L warranty, not just the local dealer's P&L. That way you can choose who fixes it and if someone happens to go out of business you're still covered."
