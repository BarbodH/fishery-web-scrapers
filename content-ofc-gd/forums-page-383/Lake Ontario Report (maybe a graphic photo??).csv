717023,danc,2012-07-22 23:51:00,4677,Geez. Maybe we should open a new forum for these types of incidents? They don't seem to be that uncommon. Most of my fishing is done barbless. Something that you guys might want to consider??
717049,whiskywizard,2012-07-23 01:44:00,305, Is this a poll?  What happened to the photo?  I want to see the gore.
717054,Pikeslayer,2012-07-23 01:52:00,1443, Fixed for you WW.
717057,mercman,2012-07-23 01:58:00,7054,"I saw it,  it was awesome !!! Simon, you really do things all the way!!! No half measures for you  eh?"
717082,craigdritchie,2012-07-23 02:51:00,1586,Dang Bill .... I'm not squeamish but that one under the fingernail just makes my hair stand on end. That's majorly nasty.  Muskie fishing tomorrow .... sure hope I can avoid renewing my membership in this club. I have enough scars on my fingers as it is.
717101,whiskywizard,2012-07-23 10:13:00,305,"Geez, Slayer, that's a nasty one.  No way to push the hook through, and a good heavy hook too.  That's going to smart for a few days."
717278,Tybo,2012-07-23 21:44:00,1373,Nice hook set Simon.
717279,dave524,2012-07-23 21:53:00,4508,"Ouch   Every single spoon on my boat has a single stainless Siwash on it, less tangles in the box and  net, most fish can be released boatside and a 66 % less chance of impaling oneself. Big thing I find less long distance releases midway through bringing it in. Only disadvantage is you sometimes brain or put an eye out on a shaker."
717296,Pikeslayer,2012-07-23 22:45:00,1443,"Good advice. I'll have set on board before the next outing  You did it twice Terry?  Actually, I have to take the rest of the week off Whisky.  Sure was Tybo  wouldn't of made a difference Dave. Just a dumb     mistake on my part.  The happy ending.. "
717303,krixxer,2012-07-23 23:22:00,274,all the empathy.... 
717312,tb4me,2012-07-24 00:09:00,3295,Lol thats funny..
717319,Billy Bob,2012-07-24 00:20:00,5865,You guys are doing it ALL WRONG.... Here is the best way to remove a hook in someone.......you can thank me later...     Bob
717323,manitoubass2,2012-07-24 00:31:00,11391," I forgot all about that BB, thanks for posting! Had me and the kids hooting and hollering for a few minutes, hahaha   We were having  a family outing on Porters inlet this weekend and you guys wouldn't believe where my son ALMOST hooked himself with a 5"" Rapala subwalk!!! First hour of the trip too, man am I glad he didnt actually get hooked, cause I'm sure it woulda required surgery and caused some mental issues... (for both of us)"
716884,Pikeslayer,2012-07-22 14:09:00,1443,"Well, I got 2 hrs until the clinic opens so thought I'd do a quick post. But I can only type one handed so I'll let the picture speak for itself.       Slayer"
716887,Rod Caster,2012-07-22 14:16:00,5784,i bet you put up a good fight
716888,Live2fish85,2012-07-22 14:18:00,1633,"Ouch. Thats a bummer, hopefully you got some nice ones before this happened."
716890,bushart,2012-07-22 14:21:00,2628,Is that one of those new fangled bleeding hooks ???  Sorry man---that probably smarts a tad
716891,lew,2012-07-22 14:23:00,12766,"I guess ""OUCH"" would about sum that up  That's not the way it's sposed to be done Simon"
716895,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-22 14:32:00,2690,"Yikes, Simon!!  Thrashing fish??"
716899,kickingfrog,2012-07-22 14:45:00,8333,"Sucks!  If you haven't already, I'd cut the other hook points off while you're waiting."
716901,Dozer,2012-07-22 15:05:00,896,"Yes, the barb is in there."
716904,Joey,2012-07-22 15:20:00,9122,"Ouch, been there, done that."
716905,Leecher,2012-07-22 15:23:00,7832,It's painful to look at
716916,spincast,2012-07-22 15:57:00,3279,  X2 - did it trying to set up a cheater about a month ago - into the meat of my thumb.
716917,blarg,2012-07-22 16:01:00,289,"I haven't done that to myself yet, really hope i never do, i dig hook my brother in the nose once, but in my defense i was roll casting a fly rod and told him not to stand there."
716920,Roy,2012-07-22 16:11:00,13728,I wish people would indicate in the subject line that there was graphic matter involved. I'm not that squeamish but I really hate to see someone hurting. I hope you're feeling good now and it's all fixed up.
716927,gino,2012-07-22 16:44:00,400,"http://i633.photobucket.com/albums/uu58/gino197/DSC03908.jpg  that's my foot, 3 weeks ago at 5:30 am, ready to go fishing...went to Parry Sound hospital instead"
716931,Skipper D,2012-07-22 16:59:00,1970,"Simon  , some people pay good money to be able to wear jewellry like that ."
716936,Dave Bailey,2012-07-22 17:40:00,1641, And you came here looking for denial of that?
716939,vinnimon,2012-07-22 18:05:00,2593,"ouch!!! The worst Ive seen was a few treble hooks stuck in someones cheek, not mine but I dug them out."
716946,Pikeslayer,2012-07-22 18:41:00,1443,"Yep, fought with the crew to stay on the water for another hour. It was only 0700!!!  It's tough out there Chris. Temps and fish are scattered. The Outlaw did lose a potential derby qualifier though. He horsed it to the stern still full of P&V and it bolted under the boat. Prop cut the leader.  Apparently. Never caught a thing until today.  I now know Lew. Next time pliers!!!  Tangled spoon (still under downrigger load) with wire dipsey Frankie  Rob, we were debating to leave it in for 'dramatic' effect/faster service at the walk in. Ended up using the bolt cutters on board.  Not any more!!!  My 'wound' pales in comparison to yours Joey.  Actually it didn't hurt much as it was in between skin & bone. Removal was a different story!!!!!!  Subject post edited Roy. Actually didn't think it was too bad but your right, some people are squeamish. So I pm'd Mercman a whole bunch of photos  . Wonder if his keyboard will still work."
716948,Pikeslayer,2012-07-22 18:46:00,1443,"It's called BLING Skip. My first piercing.  Actually Dave, I am here for OFC Group Therapy/Rehab ""My name Simon and I am a fishaholic..................""  Now that would HURT Vince."
716950,lew,2012-07-22 18:55:00,12766," Get yourself a set of Knipex cutters Simon, you can easily cut any sized hook with one hand.  Kinda spendy but well worth the $$$$ when your hung up with a thrashing fish on the other end of the lure and you need to get free in a hurry."
716951,Terry,2012-07-22 19:09:00,14456, X2
716959,mike rousseau,2012-07-22 19:47:00,4661,Yeeeeoooowwwch
716977,mercman,2012-07-22 20:24:00,7054,  Dang !!!!! That sucks big time !!!!
716980,BillM,2012-07-22 20:51:00,17367,I wanna play to!!  
716984,GBW,2012-07-22 21:08:00,8460,oh so true.  my dad just got a set a lowes the other day for only $50 (or less) and they cut like a hot knife through butter
