717325,farsider,2012-07-24 00:42:00,456,"I did the exact same thing for my sister. 16' of pole above ground.  Do all your rigging before you raise the pole(especially the line itself)  Check your distance.  I ended up having to get the 200' length of clothesline.  Use the largest pulley wheel you can find.  I think I used 10""(really easy to use, even when full).  I put in a cross bar and two 45 degree supports at the top that resemble the older hydropole setups -- thinking of running two lines total.  Three average sized dudes should be able to lift it up.  The tallest guy farthest away from the hole, and walk it upright.    The strongest guy, closest to the hole, lifts and repositions as it slips into the hole.  The last guy is standing on a strong step-ladder, pickup bed, scaffolding, etc. alongside the intended raising line, and helps bring it the last bit vertical.  Fun, fun, fun.  Cheers, Mark"
717326,mercman,2012-07-24 00:44:00,7054,"Geez, by the looks of that pole, just pick it up.Cant weigh more that 70-80lbs.it looks like cedar, and dried like it is, it must be lite as a feather"

717370,Skipper D,2012-07-24 02:28:00,1970,"  The best advice i can offer would be , take off your pants and put on a skirt , up right the pole and grab the butt end firmly in both hands and toss up wards with all your might ........... thats how the Scots do it in Maxville ......... lol ."

717378,Raf,2012-07-24 02:40:00,3495," 21.5' long and 10"" diameter.. my guesstimate was off -- I updated the post later on.  Still, I think 3 guys should be able to manhandle it into place like farsider mentioned (thanks).  ..and y'all are welcome for the comic relief."

Good luck let us know how it goes    Ian"
717381,mercman,2012-07-24 02:56:00,7054,oh...so its an actual telephone pole.ok. A couple of Musky guys should be able to man handle that pole.

717389,Sinker,2012-07-24 03:24:00,8692,"Raf, you and a couple buddies can lift that pole up no problem. It might be a little awkward, but totally doable. Dig a big hole and drop it in. Concrete if you want, but I wouldn't bother. Just tamp it in as you back fill it.  s."

717447,fishnsled,2012-07-24 14:32:00,3520,"One of the most impressive things I saw my ex-father-in-law do, was to replace the hydro poles on his property by himself. Well he did have the aid of his tractor. Dig the hole (by hand) and with a series of ropes and pulleys he'd use the tractor to guide the pole to the hole and lift it into place. Amazing thing to have watched, wish I had some video of that."
717189,Raf,2012-07-23 18:27:00,3495,"I need to put up a pole (for a clothesline).  I have a wood pole that looks like it will be perfect for the job, I'd guesstimate it at 15' tall.  My understanding is I need to dig a hole 3-4' deep.  Renting a post hole digger would help this but I suppose it can be done manually.  I plan to dig a trench leading to the hole where the pole will rest then pull the pole up using my truck and some helpers to guide it.  Idea is the pole will wedge against the wall of the hole and 'stand up' then fill it back up.  Stop me before I kill myself or damage something  I'm in the Erin/Orangeville/Fergus triangle if you'd like to stop by & watch the show. (or offer to help!)  edit: it's a 21.5' long pole, 10"" diameter"
717192,smally21,2012-07-23 18:35:00,993,"how big is the pole that requires a truck to lift it? can't you just lift the end, other end falls in the hole, stand it up, brace it with 2x4 and a stake...  you got this idea from the eqyptians or something, but those were 40ton blocks.."
717194,Raf,2012-07-23 18:40:00,3495,"smally that might work given enough hands.. it's a fairly heavy pole but you're right, i may be overthinking this.  crude diagram not to scale, when pole hits opposite wall it pivots, falls into hole and stands  "
717196,BillM,2012-07-23 18:42:00,17367,"Do it properly with concrete once and never worry about it again.  There's also no reason you need a trench or anything in that pic, lol!!  Dig the hole, put the post in it and fill with concrete.  Some stakes and some 2x4's will keep it straight until the concrete hardens."

717198,Raf,2012-07-23 18:46:00,3495,LOL.. glad I could provide some comedy for you all.  This brilliant plan was devised on a napkin at lunch.
717201,smally21,2012-07-23 18:53:00,993,"its not a barn raising Raf, stick it in the hole. A belly full of coors light should help things go smoothly."
717202,Spiel,2012-07-23 18:58:00,9065,"I'm no expert Raf but my thoughts are, dig/auger hole large enough to accommodate a Sono tube about 3"" to 4""s larger than the base of the pole. Plant it at least 4' deep (or more if you can) with a little concrete at the base of the hole, insert Sono tube, center and back fill then get some muscle to insert the pole, center pole and fill with with fast set concrete and Bobs your Uncle."
717203,BucktownAngler,2012-07-23 18:59:00,582,i agree with the concrete method

717221,misfish,2012-07-23 19:43:00,29133,"Don,t forget the mushroom out the bottom of the hole.Will help from heaving."
717227,HTHM,2012-07-23 19:56:00,4082,"First thing to do is to call for locates. Digging into a cable can be very expensive, and possibly fatal. http://www.on1call.com/ Secondly, I would suggest that you use a 3"" diameter pipe, into a 8"" diameter hole at least 4' deep. And as Misfish says mushroom / \ the bottom of the hole to prevent lifting. If you decide to use the wood pole, it would be best if you can have a minimum of 4"" of concrete around the pole. To lift, tuck the end of the pole in the hole, lift at one end with a couple of guys and let 'er drop in. Plumb, brace, and pour concrete. Good luck."
717231,Roy,2012-07-23 20:05:00,13728,"Yes, in the Erin area you need 40"" plus to ensure it doesn't heave with the seasons. I'd also set the pole at a very slight angle away from the pull of the clothesline......there's no telling what a boat tarp, a tent and 2 sleeping bags will do.   edit: If it's wood you're using, you might want to treat/seal it to prevent rot."
717237,Handlebarz,2012-07-23 20:23:00,3790,Dang and to think I just took a 6' 2X4 and nailed it to the deck and then put a anchor bolt into the corner of my shed to run my 50' clothesline. I just took it down last week as per the real state guy he said it did not look so good. But like red green would have said it was handy

717304,tb4me,2012-07-23 23:43:00,3295,I think everyone here is missing the point..He is trying to put a hydro pole in the ground to use as a clothes line. Im not to sure how to do it myself but simply lifting it into a sono tube isint going to happen..RAF try looking it up on you tube..Thats my go to when I need help with somthing..

717308,Terry,2012-07-23 23:53:00,14456,if it's that long and heavy you may want to go down 5 ft and if you don't cement it you should use a cable and rod to support it
717310,Raf,2012-07-24 00:03:00,3495," that's mostly correct.. it could propably be used as a utility pole.  we have an elevated deck, the clothesline needs to run from the house out to the pole, a good ways up above the ground and it has to run parallel with the deck so we can put clothes on it without falling over the railing.  here's what I am up against      "
717313,kickingfrog,2012-07-24 00:11:00,8333, Looks like someone has already put a clothes line pole up for you.
717317,Raf,2012-07-24 00:19:00,3495,The angle you'd have running the line to that pole would mean you'd have to lean over the railing quite a ways in order to put clothes on -- maybe even out of reach.
