715751,Marty,2012-07-18 16:36:00,873,"It was a great week at Sandy Haven Camp.   We didn't get to fish for muskies much but the walleye fishing was on fire.   We could have limited each day if we tried.   It was Dirt's 3rd trip to Canada and if he keeps catching fish at this rate, he may want to move up there.  Here's his first walleye:    Here's his second:    First smallie:    Stringer of walleyes:    Stringer of jumbo perch.   They were unusually large:    Then Dirt went off.   He ended up nailing the biggest smallie, sheepshead, perch and walleye for the week:           It was a fantastic trip.   Can't wait for next year."

715759,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 16:50:00,8333,How the years fly by eh. 
715769,Rod Caster,2012-07-18 17:13:00,5784,Holy cow! Good job fishing out nipissing. Any left? Haha. I'd say he'll definitly be back to nipissing at some point in his life... Some great memories were just made.
715773,lew,2012-07-18 17:26:00,12766,"Great trip Marty, looks like you've got some competition on your hands these days....but Dirt ??....where'd that one come from ??   :lol:  Can't believe how much he's grown in the last couple years.  I think that pic Rob posted was when ""Dirt"" grabbed the tackle box off the table thinking it was his prize....that was priceless"
715779,Roy,2012-07-18 17:41:00,13728,"That's my Dawson Bud. Without him, you guys would have starved! Well done."
715780,Squid,2012-07-18 17:44:00,1656,Nice report Marty glad to see dirt catching all the fish!
715851,Marty,2012-07-18 21:14:00,873,"Thanks guys.   ""Dirt"" is the nickname his baseball teammates gave him two years ago.   It has stuck.  He's really becoming quite the fisherman.  When the adults all wanted to come in to play cards and have a refreshment, he complained that there was fishing to do.   Todd at Sandy Haven has already planted the seed for Dirt to be the dockboy up there some day."

717709,Rich Clemens,2012-07-25 12:30:00,3131,He sure had a great time and cathing fish is all the better.  I too remember the year Dawson was up for the OFC GTG.  A number of folks gave their prices from the table to Dawson and that boy was in heaven with all the stuff he got.  Truely a memorable moment.   Thanks for posting Marty and give our high-fives to Dawson on a great trip.
