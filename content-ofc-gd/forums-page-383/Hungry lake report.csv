717300,archer379,2012-07-23 23:03:00,277,We bought a cottage type thing on this lake up near kaladar last feb. this was the first weekend we didn't have a ton of work to do so we got out for some fishing  Saturday evening and Sunday morning we didn't have to go far from the creek the cottage is on when we were on the fish. With the my nephew and daughter useing just worms she is 11 and he is 3 they caught a ton of small bass and the biggest rock bass I have ever seen . The nephew caught his first fish ever with his lighting McQueen fishing pole (from the movie cars) as we moved along we started find less fish but bigger were out till about 930 and had a great time  Sunday morning was more of the same was catching fish in about the 2pound range considering we only hit a couple of spots this lake shoud produce some quality fish the only problem was  the launch when I went to leave I sunk up to my axle about half way out. Any one have a dozen patio slabs they don't need for the next time
