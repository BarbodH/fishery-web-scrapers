717554,Joey,2012-07-24 20:41:00,9122,"This could go in the photo section, but I thought I'd share the cool pics of before and after yesterday's storm.  The before clouds I had never seen before (anyone ever seen these clouds before?).  We sure got a good slammer and I thought our birch tree was toast for awhile there.  Here they are, hope you enjoy:          And then after:     "
717557,Joey,2012-07-24 20:49:00,9122, Me neither.  I was thinking more the stay fresh marshmallow man from Ghostbusters
717560,misfish,2012-07-24 20:55:00,29133,"  HAHAHAHA Ya me too.  Cool shots J.  I was going to take some last night,but the rain was crazy.Did,nt want to get the camera wet."
717564,davey buoy,2012-07-24 21:00:00,5505,"Weird weather,and never seen those types of clouds either.B nothing but a drop here.6-8 km maybe?. Funny how these storms hit."
717575,Roy,2012-07-24 21:20:00,13728,"They're called ""mammatus"" (Latin for ""udders"") and form at the base of a storm cloud.  Great pics, Joey!"
717576,ehg,2012-07-24 21:21:00,2666, Those rounded finger like clouds are called mammatus. The after pictures were further storms that didn't come to fruition.  Mammatus are seen on the back end of severe complexes after they pass. My guess is that weather that was stronger passed to your northeast. Only see mammatus about once a year in around GTA.  We only had a FEW drops of rain in downtown Toronto but we had stormy looking clouds and a bit of mammatus as well. The main storms were northeast of here.  Nice pictures!
717577,lew,2012-07-24 21:23:00,12766,Crazy looking clouds for sure and some great pictures Joey.  We got some heavy rain over this way for awhile too and it was very welcome as it was the 1st rain in 15 days.  Could still use a bunch more though.
717580,Joey,2012-07-24 21:32:00,9122," Cool, thanks for the info.  I must agree, even though we got a good storm, I think the bigger portion was either northwest or south of us."
717583,Billy Bob,2012-07-24 21:36:00,5865,We have a PHOTO SECTION.....
717585,lew,2012-07-24 21:46:00,12766,Here's a picture I took a few years ago Joey that shows clouds looking similar to yours.  
717586,Joey,2012-07-24 21:51:00,9122," Actually I remember that now Lew.  They look the same, but there are definately more in your photo!!!"
717587,misfish,2012-07-24 21:51:00,29133,"I remember that cool pic Lew.    BB ,Start from the top of the thread."
717589,Roy,2012-07-24 21:52:00,13728,"That's a great example of mammatus, Lew."

717604,Sinker,2012-07-24 23:12:00,8692,"Love a good storm! Nice pics, Joey. I wish I had my camera with me yesterday. I had skies similar to what lew posted. We still need a lot more rain though.  Great pics!  S."
717625,solopaddler,2012-07-24 23:56:00,8605,"As a weather guy I love these kinds of spectacles.  Last night at the Hamilton airport the show in the sky above was unreal. Great billowing purple/black clouds with multiple bolts of lightning shooting out from inside. When it passed directly overhead I thought maybe an alien spacecraft was landing LOL!  Very cool pic's both of you guys!  (And they're not mammatus, they're cumulosarcoma   )"
717627,danc,2012-07-25 00:07:00,4677," It's a photography forum BB, not a photo forum. Big difference.  And does anyone remember this shot that Limeyangler took a few months back?? Some nice udders in this one.  "
717658,Leecher,2012-07-25 01:58:00,7832,"Nice pics Joey and Lew     We got hammered pretty good last night... actually twice with heavy rain, extremely strong winds and hail (some the size of toonies).  My cousin who lives 15 minutes away from me, his neighbor's house got hit by lightning and caught on fire   I saw him on the 6 o'clock news and he said that he immediately called 911 after he saw the bolt and smoke coming out of the roof... while they we were waiting for the fire fighters, they used their own water hose but it wasn't enough    The fire was spreading fast     The good thing is that no one was injure."
717667,pics,2012-07-25 02:45:00,1268,We got at least 5 or 6 inches of rain judging by the amount of water in all the buckets around my garden. Our road was closed due to flooding and the local timmies was surronded by water...
717681,motv8tr,2012-07-25 03:23:00,2587,Very cool pictures Joey...  Maureen
