717190,krixxer,2012-07-23 18:30:00,274,I keep my eye out on the charters and they seem to be all over the place.
717200,SlowPoke,2012-07-23 18:50:00,2984,We've been getting blue zone action a mile off shore. No need to go out there in my opinion.
717205,capt bruce,2012-07-23 19:02:00,820," With the early showing of 30+ chinnys in close and off the drop no one had to go out very far (not to talk about the stupid cost of gas).. Now with the water all mixed up , its hard to find an area with good water and the bait has scattered, if I have regalar customers and want to make sure of fish i have in the last two weeks gone out to 350-400 feet but not off the credit more over off the islands , water plant .. 25 feet to the flat lines have been bringing in the rainbows in double digets all day .. But if you want a big chinny for the derby fish the drop  early morning or east of the bluffs in 80 to 150 in the afternoon , not big on numbers but the biggens are there , scattered tho lots of miles lots of gas BUT !!!! ... tight lines"
