I get the goat horns tonight as last night Tyler had a snag and I tightened his drag to break line.  Yep you guessed it, I forgot to loosen it back off for tonights fishing.  He had a great fish on jumped several times looked to be all of 4 lb smallie.  About 1 foot from shore as I am running to help him I hear the deafening snap of his line breaking.  I felt like crap when I realized what had happened.   We did manage to land some fish.  My first fish was around 2 1/2 lbs and when I got it about 3 feet from shore in about 2 feet of water i noticed 5 more fish identical in size, give or take a few inches, swarming around the hooked fish.  I have seen 1 or 2 fish and several small ones follow a hooked fish but this is the first time I had seen so many large fish like this.  We managed several smaller fish before I landed the twin to my first fish.  Later on my wife got in to the act with a fish similar in size 2  2 1/2 lbs.  All in all another great evening.               Thanks    Ian"
