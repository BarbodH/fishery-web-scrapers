182157,mikethespike,2008-04-05 04:31:00,51,"just checked the zone maps and google earth,  if you meant Lake Ontario Shoreline, Lynde Shores then that would be zone 20, but if u were referring to Cranberry M a r s h, Lynde Shores Conservation Area then that would be zone 17.  of course it wouldn't hurt if some1 verifies this also  hope this helps  its funny how it changes the word ""m a r s h"" to ""whats his name"" took me 3 edits b4 i figured it out lol"
