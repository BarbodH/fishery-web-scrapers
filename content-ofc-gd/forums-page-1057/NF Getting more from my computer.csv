I always feel that I am not getting nearly as much as I can from the internet. Does anyone know of the best way to get and view movies, TV shows, etc. from the net? Thanks!"

As far as downloading movies it takes a long time and there are many sites to do so, I use limewire. You can view them on windows media player or burn it onto a disc. TV/Satellite you can get a DVB card and hook a satellite dish up to your computer but your on your own there. Or Youtube has many interesting videos to watch all the time as well as old shows, movies ect.. better then regular TV anyway. Theres pay sites and free ones, I use the free limewire for most music, movies.  But remember the more you download the more problems your computer starts having, and you'll need to scan and clean you computer more often, it can slow things down. I do download lot's though, get yourself a external hard drive and save/download all your media on that instead of your main hard drive."
