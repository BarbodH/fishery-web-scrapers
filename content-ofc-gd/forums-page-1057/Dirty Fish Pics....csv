181868,Gerritt,2008-04-04 21:45:00,6129,  I think Steve should start posting Musky reports!... the difference being grow men are attacking you... not hormonal teens...  G
181899,maybe,2008-04-04 22:31:00,307," Dirty, but the fish gets clean.  Standing ovation for the on-topic double header, and a good laugh!  "
181901,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-04 22:36:00,1183,"  I think that I may be one of those although I don't whiz...I just reply on a lot of posts.  I enjoy it.  I don't get out to fish near as much as I would like.  I am new at it.  I have posted my fishing highlights in the past but they were removed at my request.  I guess I will just remain the occassional lurker and when I actually do have a fishing report then I will post it....or maybe not.  I envy all of you who can get out and enjoy the fishing.  Some of us are not so fortunate, but we like to feel that telling someone that we enjoyed their report would be contributing to this community.  I guess I was wrong.  But you know what...I was never made to feel that I shouldn't be here until now. Ya...I guess I too am sensitive...and I see where insults can be thrown every which way. Anyway...it's phucking snowing here.  I hope to have a post in the next few months.  Cheers  Also...I will come back one more time to send someone a PM that a promised...I hope that's okay."
181902,Greencoachdog,2008-04-04 22:38:00,8163," Crappies are just skillet fodder anyway, so it doesn't matter how you hold them!!!"

181907,Greencoachdog,2008-04-04 22:43:00,8163," All nice replies are appreciated!... and the idea of bringing the towel along to lay the fish on was a good one. If you're not whizzin' on folks reports, I wasn't talking about you.  It's the PEANUT GALLERY that never has anything nice to say and is aways critical that I was talkin' about."
181908,muskymike,2008-04-04 22:45:00,772,"Jeez, here I am thinking I was going to post pics from all of my trips this summer, now I am thinking better of it. Especially the Musky ones.  Hmmmm, on second thought, nah, I am still going to post (if i catch anything). Now if I can dig up my Musky Photos, the ones where Gaffs were used in the gills, on the bottom of the boat with my foot on the fish with my hands in the air proclaiming I am the worlds best Musky fisherman, Vertical Holds, OOS fish...damn, where are these pics.

181912,highdrifter,2008-04-04 22:49:00,2534," They might get plenty of fish, but they're probably recluses who don't get enough kuna.  HD"
181926,aniceguy,2008-04-04 23:16:00,1094,"it must be springtime and cabin fever is at an altime high.  Silt off a bank can lead to gill rot, infection on and on   holding it by the gills can cause infection or worse a broken back, a fish left out of the water for extended time can do harm too. I think we can offer a lot of other reasons why mis handelling a fish  is not a great thing.......... what the heck maybe we dont fish anymore, for fear of a P3TA groupie jumping from the bush.  If the aim of the fish on the bank or in the boat is a picture and releasing the fish is the end result the least anyone can do is pay a bit of respect to the fish and compose a picture that shows off the fish, saved a memory of the day and in the end did the least amount of harm to the fish over all..  The internet is a great resource to learn how to compose a terrific picture and its always nicer to see an interestingly composed shot then one that leads to controversy and beyond.  a pic from a while back from a high silt environment, a bit of time to land the fish and a few seconds more to think about the composite shot...

181980,Roy,2008-04-05 00:30:00,13728,"Tiller? beer? wings? Dang? Common carp?....you forgot Mod Q.  We have the best fishing discussion board in North America right now. We are a community of folks from all walks of life with a common bond called fishing. A few people have been a little less than civil in the last while and for that reason, most of them now have the read only privilege. A lot of people put a lot of time and effort into making this community what it is today. I don't think that any of those people would like to see our community become what some of the other fishing boards have become. So, to you detractors who still have posting privileges I say, keep'em coming, I have loads of time and am used to dealing with children.  Have a great evening everyone."
181718,highdrifter,2008-04-04 18:08:00,2534," Bashing posts is no fun, but seriously.  You post quite a bit, and everytime, it's the same thing.  Muddy trout.  People will see this, so you best leave yourself open some level for critizism.  Doesn't this look better?  And wouldn't you think it gives a more positive impression?    cheers HD"

181726,brickNblock,2008-04-04 18:14:00,598,"Glen, Thanks for starting this 2nd thread sorta on the same topic. I'll not apologize for my poor choice of words that were put out into the internet in response to somebody elses reply earlier.  They were borne out of the lack of respect shown to a member here who has ENTERTAINED US ALL over the years. I'd rather see a pic of a fish straight from the water, dirtied or whatever knowing that is was freshly caught only to be quickly released and not overhandled and prepped for a photo. There has been many large fish Ive caught that spent too much time being brought in that simply had to be released immediately...NO TIME FOR A PIC,  This is another great reason for the superBraids insert:(PowerPro), it still happens tho but, is greatly reduced. As you stated Bud....it takes alot of time and effort to post w/pics and to post as many as CC does is a big contribution to this board. I know Scott and this wont deter him from posting further....(someone reffered to his lack of real toughness...what a joke). But...someone new...may be deterred if happened to them and that is not good for us at OFC. Ive seen some here a tenth of the time Ive been here,  with twice as many posts as me (and more)...but wheres the pics and or contribution. This board is great for many reasons and one of them is the mods for allowing a wide variety of topics and we have now become a community.......Most of us are great friends. Keep up the good work Scott. Glen, thanks for starting this thread. bNb  Its getting tiring listening to some folk complaining about CC's caps. Get over it will Ya's. We did along time ago."

181786,maybe,2008-04-04 20:02:00,307,"Looks like I've stuck my foot in it.  I apologize!  The caps lecture is a reflex with me.  Adminning tech Listservs, I get the same problems over and over again.  Caps-typer feeding frenzies are one of them.  If a caps-typer joins any of the lists, I can set my watch by how long that group will take to declare it an   and rip its head off.  If I don't jump in to explain what's happening to the newbie, and help them smooth it over in lower case, they don't survive long in the group.  Anyway, kafuffle + the ""victim"" is a caps-typer = auto-pilot try to help.  Again, I'm sorry.  I'm sure CC is a great guy underneath it all, but I don't think I'll ever read all-caps with triple exclamation points without wanting to hide under my desk.  Could we please wander back closer to on-topic now?  No sarcasm, I'm honestly trying to figure out this washing slime off thing.  Would hate to harm a fish because I didn't know something basic."
181810,highdrifter,2008-04-04 20:39:00,2534, I'm sure you have rules and good practices and abide them everytime you hit the tribs.  It's just hard sometimes to not think objectively.  We've probably just been couped up for too long.  I'm also a tad envious of your knowledge and success.  Respect brotha.  Hope to see you in action someday.  I'll no doubt learn something.  peace HD

181477,Greencoachdog,2008-04-04 13:10:00,8163,"Does it hurt the fish? I'm not sure, but I don't think it really helps them either.  To be honest, a clean fish is much more photogenic than a dirty one. How much trouble is it to give the fish a couple swishes in the water to clean it off just before a pic? Or maybe just hold the fish out at arms length to take the pic so it doesn't have to flop around in the mud or grass?  Bleeding fish can be cleaned up too, or maybe just not post that fish. Human blood on a fish however is most desireable, it shows the fish got a good lick in during the fight and landing process!!!  I'm not condeming anybody for taking or posting these pics, I'm sure they have the fishes best interest at heart and just want to take a quick pic and get the fish back in the water as soon as possible.  Instead of whizzing and moaning about something like this in a persons report, I don't reply at all. Remember! It takes time and effort to post a report and the people that take that time should be commended not whizzed on!!!  I've also noticed that most of the people that do the whizzing, rarely if ever have posted a report... and to you I say ""Shut the Hell up!!!"

181534,canadian_copper,2008-04-04 14:31:00,925,I'LL TOUCH SOME BASE ON THIS ONE SINCE IM THE ONE TAKIN THE HEAT LATELY. DIRT WILL HURT A FISH IF IT GETS IN ITS GILLS. SO WILL FINGERS BUT WE NEVER HEAR COMMENTS ON THAT. HANDLING THE FISH YES WILL REMOVE SOME OF THE SLIME. WASH THE DIRT OFF YA WASH THE SLIME OFF. THE PIC WITH THE BLOOD I WAS JUST SHOWING YES SOMETIMES FISH HAVE TO BE TAKEN . YA CANT HELP WHERE THE HOOK GOES SOMETIMES.I COULD OF RELEASED THAT FISH BUT IT WOULD OF JUST DIED SO WHY WASTE IT. IM NO STEELHEAD GOD AND NEVER THOUGHT I WAS. I HUMAN JUST LIKE THE REST AND SURE I MAKE MISTAKES TOO. MY RELEASES ARE DO VERY FAST!!! CAMERA IS ALWAYS READY AND DONT WASTE TIME TRYIN TO GET THE PERFECT POSE AND ANGLE.  EAST SHORELINES ARE ALL MUD AND IT IS HARD TO DEAL WITH AT TIMES!!! I DIDNT HAVE MY WADERS ON SO I COULDNT WALK INTO THE WATER LIKE I NORMALLY DO!!!  ITS FUNNY HOW STEELHEAD GUYS GET THE WORST ON THIS TOPIC!!! IVE SEEN SO MANY PICS ON HERE OF FISH BEING HANDLED IN A POOR MANNER BUT THEY NEVER GET COMMENTS!!! FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS.  ALL SAID AND DONE WE ALL TRY TO DO ARE BEST AT TIMES.

The percentage of members that actually do post reports on this board is pretty low in comparison to the overall membership... and afterall, isn't that what we're mainly here for?

I don't see much difference between that motion and fish swimming.  Could someone please explain to me how gently moving a fish through water to knock the salad off is different than what'll happen when it swims away?  I'm confused.  Please bear in mind that TYPING ALL IN CAPS MEANS THAT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS.  If you actually intended the post as a hostile screaming diatribe, no problem.  If it's normal conversation, caps should be reserved for special emphasis, or differentiation.  It's a lot easier to be sympathetic to someone who isn't shouting at you.  I could really use a hands-up, submissive-or-at-least-non-threatening smiley right about now."

181689,largemouth,2008-04-04 17:41:00,112, do you go around yelling to everyone in real life or just from behind your keyboard?  In my opinion your confusing your internet ingnorance and rudeness for real life toughness and strength.
