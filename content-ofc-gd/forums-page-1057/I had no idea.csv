182543,Stoty,2008-04-06 01:46:00,2910,"Ya man, thats awesome!!!!  Congrats to Alex, and the rest of the Caps! They deserve it."
182556,OhioFisherman,2008-04-06 02:11:00,6623,"LOL Joe, been some kind of rumor there was a football team in Cleveland too."
182567,charlied,2008-04-06 02:35:00,584,yep..they did awsome the second half of the season....It would be a tragedy if Ovechkin doesn't get MVP.  He deserves it for sure.
182577,Mike the Pike,2008-04-06 03:09:00,3421,And now you have a great goalie for your team.you should watch Hockey it could get your american blood flowing
182582,sturgman,2008-04-06 03:31:00,249, Lew Franceschetti is awesome!
182584,Raf,2008-04-06 03:35:00,3495,for sure check out that Ovechkin kid.. he might get you hooked on the Caps again.
182618,jughead,2008-04-06 10:14:00,92,"That Ovechkin kid looks solid, I think he's going to stick with the team.  On a much sadder note, after spanking my Sens in all 4 meetings this year it looks like the caps and sens are set to meet in the first round with the sens missing Alfredsson, Fisher and Kelly. I am not swimming in optimism. On the bright side, my wife will be happier with me not ignoring the family and cursing loud enough for the lake to hear trying to get decent TV reception on the deck at the cottage in the middle of June, Guess I'll have to do things like, I don't know, talk to my family and stuff. The things I do, I should get a medal."
182643,Tinman,2008-04-06 13:43:00,376,"My cousin plays for them, Matt Bradley, glad to see the caps make it thats for sure!"
