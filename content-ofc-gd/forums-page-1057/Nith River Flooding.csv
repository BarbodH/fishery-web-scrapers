181799,fatherof3,2008-04-04 20:17:00,1769,I got some pics in my email of recent flooding in the town of New Hamburg.I thought it was amazing the difference from a pic I already had.Here are the two. This one is from a couple years ago.  This is the same area from a couple days ago.  The water-wheel is just to the right in the first pic.from the other pics I was sent a lot areas in town were flooded.Here are a few more to share.

181807,Cookslav,2008-04-04 20:34:00,1457,"The Nith is such a shallow thin river it doesn't take much to burst her banks.... It was bad this week period. Not been at those levels since the big flood of 1973.  Heck I've seen the Nith rise a foot over her banks only a few hours after a heavy rain, let alone in the midst of a flash thaw, with record snow falls.... Could have been much worse considering we didn't get all the rain they called for. The Nith is really flood prone because It collects a lot of run off from the vast farming areas surrounding it(large non regulated spill ways). That and the fact that it is pretty much all clay out there So not much is absorbed, it simply runs into the Steams and river and WOOOSH! Away it goes....  I can't wait to see some of My fishing spots from last year LOL....they won't be there any more That river litteraly changes shapes and depths every spring....this year it should be very interesting. Thats what I like about it...Makes it kind of sporting"

181842,tbayboy,2008-04-04 21:31:00,1497,"I heard it was bad but wow, thats pretty nuts.  Wonder if the x-rap I left hung on the far retaining wall of the nith is free now?  Richyb - what a genius idea"
181851,jjcanoe,2008-04-04 21:35:00,744,Passing by it several times a day along the 401 you can really see the ups and downs of the water levels. That also means the high waters can receed just as fast  jjcanoe
181879,fatherof3,2008-04-04 22:07:00,1769,"The Nith in Paris dropped over a metre overnight but still very fast. Tbay,that retaining wall was a good foot under water yesterday so I think your x-rap might be free.lol."
181883,canadian_copper,2008-04-04 22:09:00,925,GOTTA BE SOME STEEL HIDING UNDER THAT TRANSPORT  LOL COOL PICS TX
182483,misfish,2008-04-05 23:31:00,29133,"I know tat spot of the river in New Hamburg. Back in the late 70,s I seen some high waters there. Boy thats alot of water. Thanks for sharing."
182517,danbouck,2008-04-06 01:00:00,4380,It's like that on the grand and speed around Cambridge too! They say if the new flood walls were not in place that it would be flooded worse than the flood of 74.
182534,Rich,2008-04-06 01:33:00,3927,"WOW, that sure is a difference. The plus side of course, would be that you could fish for carp and get beer at the same place, LOL"
182544,fatherof3,2008-04-06 01:52:00,1769,"lol,very true Rich"
182546,Cookslav,2008-04-06 02:00:00,1457,"Drove by the Grand and the speed today.... they were high alright, but I've seen them much worse?  Seems odd to the the Nith so high yet the Grand seems to be round normal ""high"" sping levels? Is it just me?  Belwood was closed for fishing this year due to low water....maybe the Belwood resevoir did the tirck?"
182563,fatherof3,2008-04-06 02:23:00,1769,"I agree Cookslav,the Grand around Paris was not as crazy as the Nith was.There was flooding on the other side of Brantford though."
182610,Cookslav,2008-04-06 07:32:00,1457,I guess the Flood controls are doing their job then
182623,danbouck,2008-04-06 12:13:00,4380,The levels have dropped quite a bit now up here.
182624,danbouck,2008-04-06 12:14:00,4380,  GRCA Filled ALL the resevoirs to control flooding.
