Still haven't taken it out of the thrown , LOL .......great read, once you start you can't stop. That was my problem. Nice other gifts too.......the best chapter in my eyes was the chapter regarding fish positioning in a river...I had no clue that fish held in some of these places and how they move to different locations of the pool in turbide conditions.... the chapter on roe tying colors has also helped me a lot lately !!!"
