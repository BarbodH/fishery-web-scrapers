182269,Ramble,2008-04-05 15:42:00,713,"that was a nice little report, and some beautiful chrome.   I HATE when the wallet goes MIA. I lost mine on the Train last year, and VIA mailed it back after it was found....and a year before that it fell out of my coat in the mall and it was turned in. I've been lucky so far. I now keep a LOT less important stuff in it.  I hope yours turn's up...  -R-"
182369,MJL,2008-04-05 20:27:00,2427,Pure beauty those fish.  Thanks for posting this report.
182423,Sandbag,2008-04-05 21:52:00,533,Hey Mike...congrats on the house  Grimsby is a great little Town that I'm sure you will like.  PM sent  Cheers  Craig
182597,Mike the Pike,2008-04-06 04:20:00,3421,Great report Mike. Sorry to hear about the lost wallet and I would hate to miss your state side steelie report.Hopefully all returns quickly
181495,solopaddler,2008-04-04 13:36:00,8605,"First off the highs:  I had a last minute invite to join an old friend steelheading. First trip of the spring for me with my work schedule so I jumped at the chance. Honestly it was a perfect day, the weather was amazing and the fish cooperated in a big way. I've only got a few lame pic's of the outing but it was a day of huge numbers. The water was way up with a perfect green tint to it and there was huge run of chrome fish. Nothing big, they were all on the small side, but full of spunk and lots of fun to catch.  My buddy with a typical sized fish      It was a fantastic spring day for a tramp through the woods  .    A couple more typical fish        After my ice fishing trip in Feb when my camera froze I bought a new one that's supposedly shockproof, freezeproof and waterproof. I definitely plan on fooling around with underwater shots this year, but this pic was my only attempt yesterday. Pretty lame I know, but I figured I'd show you  .  .  Now the biggest high of the day: I called Joanne on the cel enroute home last night and was told that our firm offer on a house in Grimsby was accepted. We've been on pins and needles waiting to find out if we'll get the house and are pretty pumped at the moment  . It's a huge upgrade on where we're at now!  Now the lows: Shortly after calling Joanne I realised that my wallet was gone with all my I.D., bank cards, papers etc.. I honestly don't know how I lost it. Actually I'm thinking maybe it was stolen, just don't know really. It's not the end of the world though BUT I've been anticipating a 4 day trip to Michigan to fish steelhead for months now and I don't think I'll be able to cross the border. I've go zero identification. Called the passport office at 9 and they can get me one with a temporary drivers lisence (no problem) plus my birth certificate (big problem as it was in my wallet). Don't think you can get a birth certificate quickly. Not totally sure, but I guess I'll find out....  (Have to say though, the good outweighs the bad in this situation, nothing is ever the end of the world  )  Cheers,  Mike"

181501,Bitsmith2k,2008-04-04 13:42:00,396,"nice report mike..  dont know when your trip is, but i managed to get a birth certificate & a passport in < 2 weeks (prolly around 4 years ago though)..  mike"
181502,ranger520vx,2008-04-04 13:42:00,164,Hows Fergie doing anyways?
181503,douG,2008-04-04 13:45:00,2693,"Hope it's found and returned, Mike.  That's the sorta thing you deserve.  Congrats on the real estate stuff, it's all coming together now."
181512,trapshooter,2008-04-04 14:02:00,1234,"As always Mike, great report and pics.  That will be fun with the underwater feature on your new camera.  I hope everything works out for you with the new house and your trip to Michigan.  I know you've been looking fwd to that trip for a long time."
181538,canadian_copper,2008-04-04 14:36:00,925,NICELY DONE BRO!!!!
181547,tbayboy,2008-04-04 14:48:00,1497,Sorry to hear about the wallet .  Congrats on the house though and what looks like a beautiful day of fishing.
181566,irishfield,2008-04-04 15:10:00,26272,Some nice clean pics there Mike... wallet..where you took your waders off..or got out of the vehicle.
181569,jonnybass,2008-04-04 15:12:00,346,Nice report. Congrats.  This is one loooooong a** fish!  
181582,Whopper,2008-04-04 15:20:00,2174,"Congrats on all the highs Mike  As far as the wallet goes, my son is going through the same thing, had someone break into to his locked garage and into his locked car and steal all his identification including his birth certificate and social security card along with two check books, he's not a happy camper.  Thanks for sharing!"
181585,ccmtcanada,2008-04-04 15:27:00,7971,"Mike...great report!  The waters looked mint!  Happy to hear about your new house....but that wallet thing sucks.  I got a birth certificate immediately at the office here in Toronto.  I think it cost me $20, but it was worth it to me at the time.  Just go to the office, take a number, offer up a few pieces of ID and they'll print it right off for you.  I'll try to get some updated info for you and PM it."
181608,snag,2008-04-04 15:59:00,1932,"Great as always.  Is that the olympus that you got?  If so, I purchased the same one. It's O.k. I'm not thrilled about the video though.  Bummer on the wallet. Double check your car!!!!"
181613,fatherof3,2008-04-04 16:05:00,1769,congrats on the fish and house
181640,solopaddler,2008-04-04 16:45:00,8605,"  Thanks everyone! As it turns out I ""might"" be okay for next week. Turns out I can get a passport without a birth certificate since my old one expired less than a year ago...  Yeah Snag, it's the Olympus 790SW. Too many buttons and functions on it to figure out for my liking, but overall nice little camera"
181678,Bly,2008-04-04 17:28:00,1556,Nice outing!   Congratulations on the house!  If you are going where I think you are in Michigan....I will be sitting around green with envy awaiting the report.....hope you are able to make it!!

181685,bpsbassman,2008-04-04 17:36:00,941,Great report Mike. Sorry to hear about the wallet. Welcome to the neighbourhood.  You will love Grimsby!
181729,Joey,2008-04-04 18:18:00,9122,Super report Mike.  Love the pics.  Now take a word of advice from my mother     Always take a copy of your ID and put it in a safe place.  It makes life much easier when it gets lost of stolen.  Joey
181747,huntervasili,2008-04-04 18:48:00,1604,WTG Mike...  too bad about the wallet but Congats on the new house and fish. I will anticipate some cool underwater photo's in the future

182182,Jeff R,2008-04-05 10:34:00,94,Congrats on the photos and the house solo....good luck withthe trip to Michigan and the wallet.
182192,mcallister.grant,2008-04-05 11:58:00,327,"Hey Mike,  Congrats on a great FISHING day. With respect to the wallet, you can go to the passport office and have them issue you an ""emergency passport"". It is usually done within 24 hours. I know a few people who have done that with no problems!"
182195,solopaddler,2008-04-05 12:14:00,8605,"Thanks to everyone for the kind words  . The wallet issue is now a non issue thank goodness. My new passport will be ready for pick up Tuesday morning, leave for Michigan Wed morning. Can't wait!"
