Pretty insane when the pro's are complaining of pulled muscles!!   http://proxy.espn.go.com/outdoors/bassmast...ournamentId=832"
182019,eye-tracker,2008-04-05 01:22:00,89,Wow... 10th place has an average bass size of 6 lbs and first place is averaging 8 lb per bass. They look like walleye tournament weights on Lake Erie.  :clapping:  -sheldon

182127,eyefish,2008-04-05 03:11:00,135,I've fished bass tournies for about 10 years now...and man wha a rush it is to catch a 25 lbs sack....25 lbs yesterday would have put you 15 lbs behind the leader...absolutely incredible!!!!!! Aroon martens said he threw back 2 sacks over 30 lbs....all I can say is WOW!
