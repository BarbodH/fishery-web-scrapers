182381,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-05 21:06:00,278,"With the nice forecast, Iceguy and myself thought it was a good day to take the boat for a wash in the lake.  Met at Iceguys house for 5:00, loaded up the boat and we were off.  Day started off slow, Then about two hours in,  Bang. Iceguy gets a nice laker off the dipsey diver.    The Release...    Then we did a whole lot of watching rods, and washing lures for about another two hours      Iceguy kinda laughs at me when I pull out an 8"" Magnum Williams Whitefish, but not 10 minutes after I do,,,     Biggest of the day, and my new personal best.  Approx. 18lbs.     Had two knockoffs as well, so overall, not a bad day.  couldn't ask for nicer weather!!  Thanks again Rob for a great day!!  Stay tuned for his video report.   Sorry about the date of the pics.  Didn't reset camera"
