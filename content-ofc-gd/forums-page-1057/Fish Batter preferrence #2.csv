179519,bbog,2008-03-31 21:08:00,665,"Yes, I use ground up Fritos BBQ corn chips when I am out of Cajun Fish Crisp. For more delicate fish I stick to Original Fish Crisp.  Anyone notice the second ingredient in Cronzy's? SALT! followed by MSG - no thanks."
179535,Bob,2008-03-31 21:39:00,370,I mix corn meal and whole wheat flour with some seasoned salt (no msg) and garlic powder for my base and then get experimental from there.

179606,Lakeshore,2008-03-31 23:12:00,56,"I really liked the original recipe Club House fish mix, but it seems like I can not find it any more on the store shelves.  I dont mind the cajun one from CH, and I am not much for the beer batter recipe or the english version. I just may have to try the Chronzy's mix."
179607,irishfield,2008-03-31 23:15:00,26272, I'm just curious if the ingredients stay the same each year ! Maybe we should compare the formula... LOL
179623,Big Tex,2008-03-31 23:45:00,18,"Give credit were credit is due,Daryl Chronozy has done a heck of a job for the last 50 yrs,I watch his show every sat and sun Breading and batter mix,he's got a winner and as far as him taking his buddies fishing,I do that everyweek  Dan Gaben Sr,guest on the show is a real gentleman,good for the sport and the Going Fishing show Keep up the good work Daryl"
179684,Guest lundboy,2008-04-01 01:18:00,0,Wow no one has voted for Shake & Bake
179692,bassmaster4,2008-04-01 01:29:00,801,i have only tried one of these and it sthe choronzy one and it was pretty good something i would buy again
179830,fishinggeek,2008-04-01 13:21:00,325,"  Salt and MSG as the 2nd and 3rd ingredients, respectively?  No thanks.  I'll pass on that considering I do not have a palate for salty foods, which my blood pressure thanks me for.  Thanks for the info.  You saved me a needless trip to the store, plus the cost of a box of breading if I wasn't careful enough to read the ingredient list.  I'll stick to my egg and buttermilk dip, then the coating of seasoned cornmeal.  Last night on WFN, Chronzy was fishing for muskies on LSC.  If anyone saw it, you'll remember he was mentioning how good muskie was, and that he preferred it to both walleye and pike.  He did bacon-wrapped fish on the BBQ and said it would work with muskie as well.  He did mention eating mortally wounded, legal length fish as well."
179937,Guest lundboy,2008-04-01 17:06:00,0," I don't call him ""the Hungry Fisherman"" for nothing.  He's never met a fish he couldn't/wouldn't eat.  Muskies are the sacred cow of fishing, he should use a little common sense."
180009,douG,2008-04-01 18:17:00,2693,I eat mortally wounded legal length cows too.
180019,Headhunter,2008-04-01 18:38:00,5703,I'd eat a vegan if there was any meat on them! HH
180026,CLofchik,2008-04-01 18:43:00,854,"Corn meal catfish fried in an iron pan on the bbq is my favourite eating fish, but that's more like a breading than a ""batter"" strictly speaking right? </batter nazi>  I like Bisquik & beer seasoned with paprika (real Hungarian paprika plzkthx) & lemon pepper.  But whichever mix you use remember the more bubbles the more flavour.  Beer or club soda gets plenty of carbonation in the mix."
180411,duber,2008-04-02 15:35:00,220,"I prefere my own , 1/3 flour-1/3 cornmeal-1/3 bread crumbs with Italian seasoning and pepper.  But I have nothing against Original Fish Crisp.  I will have to try Cronzeys mix sometime.  Will the MSG will make me taste better to the worms when I'm gone?"
180412,Headhunter,2008-04-02 15:38:00,5703,No Duber... you won't taste any better when your gone... the worms will simply get sleepy and have a long lie down! HH
180419,mustfish,2008-04-02 15:53:00,32,crushed pretzels and walleye mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Walleye!
181376,maybe,2008-04-04 04:34:00,307,"Kept an eye out while I was grocery shopping, and I didn't find any of their mixes.  Not sure which version you mean by ""original recipe.""  If it's still in production, it'll be on this product page and you can see which stores carry it by using their product locator form.  Seems Walmart handles all of their batter mixes, but other stores only carry some of them.  Good luck!"
181603,Guest lundboy,2008-04-04 15:50:00,0,"Hmmm...  McCormick now owns FishCrisp, they also own Clubhouse.  Maybe the discontinued the Clubhouse batter when they bought FC.  http://www.food-business-review.com/articl...40-8E432F348A25"
182612,verno,2008-04-06 08:25:00,178,Panko bread crumbs with grated parmesan cheese and pepper.
179116,Guest lundboy,2008-03-30 23:28:00,0,"Hopefully this one works, lets try again!   Since the season is almost here I thought it would be a good idea to get some experienced taste tester opinions on commercial batters. I'm always thinking of trying one, but I didn't like the FC Cajun when I tried it.  I usually just use seasoning salt and flour."
179122,mistyriver1,2008-03-30 23:37:00,600,I actually take a whole bunch of flavours of the FC or the Uncle Bucks stuff from Bass Pro and mix it with Bread crumbs.
179123,Greencoachdog,2008-03-30 23:38:00,8163,"I don't care for commercial batters or mixes. I prefer my fish rinsed patted dry with a paper towel and dredged in a seasoned flour made from all purpose flour, garlic salt, and black pepper.  Ol Yeller makes a pretty mean fried fillet with patted dry fillets dipped in beaten egg and then rolled in Progresso Italian seasoned bread crumbs!"
179128,pikehunter,2008-03-30 23:51:00,1659," Now you went and done it!    Not available up here, at least where I shop,   so now you're going to have to bring some of those Americanized Italian bread crumbs north with you to Lakair for the gang to have a taste. Sounds good, betcha if you went and mixed a little Parmesan cheese in with the crumbs it would have a nice zing to it.  Oh yeah, I had to vote for my own secret recipe because I've never tried the commercial ones. Might try Chronzie's one of these days, after all, a guy that eats as much fish as him must have some good ideas"
179129,fishindevil,2008-03-30 23:53:00,6254,"Hey dawg you stole me recipe !!!! man i love fish done that way too!!!!!....man im gettin a hungry on with all this talk about breading,  egg,flour,milk,garlic,saly & lemon & herb pepper....then into a fry pan with about 1/4inch of hot sunflower oil ....man its soooooo goooood that way !!"
179143,danbouck,2008-03-31 00:20:00,4380,I love the beer battered fish crisp!
179149,steve barrett,2008-03-31 00:25:00,142,Hi guys.Has anyone tried old Cronzy's  fishing batter mix.Been fifty years mixing it .Might be kind of crusty by now .I like the old mixes of flour salt spices crumbs and beer. Dont forget the hot oil  and beans.Like watching old Cronz  Hate his old reruns .Seen one run eight times in a row over a few weeks .He talks in his rants about taking kids out fishing .But he never takes any out .He takes out his old buds or the lodge owner who supplies him with a free or cut rate to push their lodge.
179150,Fisherman,2008-03-31 00:27:00,7201,"I use only Choronzy's mix now, even if your oil isn't quite hot enough, the fish won't stick in the pan."
179158,joefish,2008-03-31 00:48:00,165,I like Trackers Fish Crisp best!!!  Since it was free!!!
179161,waterwolf,2008-03-31 00:55:00,556," he's getting worse with each show . eat what? eat when?  eat your ego !!!  that otta feed you .  used to tolerate the show ,,, but the batter push is too much.  like the cajun F. C. with flour to soften it a bit ,,S & P ,,lemonseasoning ,,  try to keep as much fish flav. as i can."
179162,Deano,2008-03-31 00:59:00,767,"Prefer my own recipe, but for the last year, I have been drooling over Kraft's TarTar sauce. Guess I've eaten so much fish and tried so many batters for so long that the only thing I never ate with fish was TarTar sauce."
179174,Zubris21,2008-03-31 01:25:00,563,"I like to make my own batter as well...  I found fish crisp was way too salty for my liking, the original anyways, I had another flavour that wasn't too bad but I don't remember which it was.   I'm also curious to know how Cronzy's batter is, but I can't  justify buying batter when it tastes just as good, and is a lot cheaper to make it yourself!"
179220,HTHM,2008-03-31 02:42:00,4082,You forgot one option......just pure unadulterated unbattered fillets. That is my favorite.
179230,Casey123,2008-03-31 02:59:00,461,"I love the Fish Crisp Beer Batter, we tried the cajun stuff.........No Thanks!  My wife has been making killer batter with almond flour and spices.  As for the Cronz, he is funny as they come, havn't trid his batter but his ranting and raving is good for some laughs."
179282,DanTheMan,2008-03-31 11:20:00,257,"Since I switch over to Daryl Choronzy's Breading & Batter Mix, I will never turn back.I must say, He has  made a great product and I love it.  If you guys havent tried, give it a shot."
179288,Gerritt,2008-03-31 12:00:00,6129,I personally like the batter I make  G
179308,Whopper,2008-03-31 13:08:00,2174," Surprise, surprise I kind of figured you to be a cornmeal guy!  I make my own"
179314,dheitzner,2008-03-31 13:26:00,314,"i have heard from someone ""in the know"" that Cronzy's is the best stuff ever.  not a huge fan of him personally, but on this persons reccomendation, i'll try his mix."
179321,Stoty,2008-03-31 13:44:00,2910,"Fish Crisp is darn good stuff and I love the cajun and beer batter, BUT  CRUSHED UP ALL-DRESSED CHIPS......  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  Has anyone else used Chips as their batter? If not, give it a try!! YUMMY!"
179336,Headhunter,2008-03-31 14:26:00,5703,"I like Gerritts batter too! Did a fine job on the fish up at Bernies! Normally, I just do the flour, egg wash and spiced bread crumbs and cook it all up in Lard! Mmmmm lard! HH"
179347,fishinggeek,2008-03-31 14:41:00,325,"I might have to get me a box.  I usually don't like commercial mixes because they're crazy expensive relative to the ingredient list, as well as being way too salty.  What's in Chronzy's mix that doesn't make it stick?  I'm guessing lecithin but I hope it's not some sort of trans fat."
179377,walleyejigger,2008-03-31 15:57:00,876,"i prefer to use a pancake batter, homemade or storebought powder, and use beer for the liquid, it tastes great and doesn't absorb much oil"
179388,doubleheader,2008-03-31 16:35:00,497,I had made my own until last year when we tried Uncle Buck's.  That stuff is really good.
179389,maybe,2008-03-31 16:37:00,307,"There's a copycat recipe being posted around.  Couldn't tell you how accurate it is, but if you're feeling adventurous it might be worth a shot."
179481,huntervasili,2008-03-31 19:49:00,1604, I will second that... Also like it with beer instead of water though...
