179310,JohnF,2008-03-31 13:11:00,3494,Is kissing a fish really all that much different than eating sushi?  JF
179356,douG,2008-03-31 14:51:00,2693,"A friend of mine bought some sushi once, took it home and cooked it up.  Said it tasted a lot like fish."
179370,wuchikubo,2008-03-31 15:31:00,1114, If you're eating good sushi there's no slime.  Now would the fish's slime have more bacteria or the person who's sliming the fish have more??!! We might be endangering the fish's health with a slimy kiss.
179416,Rich,2008-03-31 17:42:00,3927,My wife won't give me the chance. She's got the lip lock on them 2 seconds out of the water.

179019,Greencoachdog,2008-03-30 20:49:00,8163,"I don't kiss them, but they do get the privilege of having their pic taken with me!"
179029,brickNblock,2008-03-30 21:13:00,598,"NOPE Just a quick pat on my reel for hanging tough and, another to the rod for standing up like a man for the task at hand."
179034,forrest,2008-03-30 21:18:00,1032,Can a person get sick from kissing a fish?  forrest
179038,irishfield,2008-03-30 21:22:00,26272,If you kiss the Mermaids (or any other species for that matter) you can get Beaver Fever.  No different than drinking untreated water.
179068,Greencoachdog,2008-03-30 22:16:00,8163,  Does this qualify as sick to you? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery  Had it when I was 12 and spent 4 days in the hospital.
179069,camillj,2008-03-30 22:16:00,1988," Ya know Wayne, I can honestly say I have never associated Beaver fever with kissing fish ... but then again its probably all in the technique ... and who's"
179084,mistyriver1,2008-03-30 22:41:00,600,Nope.    and neither does Ben.  
179101,steve barrett,2008-03-30 23:01:00,142,
179107,Guest lundboy,2008-03-30 23:06:00,0,"See what Jimmy Houston started, now everyone does it. Should be careful using tongues though.   Never have kissed one, and I hope I never have to."
179160,forrest,2008-03-31 00:52:00,1032,"  Yep, having dysentery would definitely qualify someone as sick.  I think I will stick to kissing clean babies and the wife.  forrest"
179271,jediangler,2008-03-31 05:14:00,1923,I only kiss smallmouth bass and any largemouth that tells you different is a LIAR!!!
179272,scuro,2008-03-31 05:20:00,386,  With smaller fish I sometimes open my mouth and stick their head as close to my mouth as I can...then I growl. It's a warning to the fish that he keeps on going with his ways...sooner or later he will be my dinner.
