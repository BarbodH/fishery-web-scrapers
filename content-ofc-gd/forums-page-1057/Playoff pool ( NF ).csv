181730,Puckhead,2008-04-04 18:19:00,377, I couldn't agree more...  Got to admit it was satisfying watching McCrap taking a pounding last night...
181732,Stoty,2008-04-04 18:23:00,2910,"HAHAHAH, yes, yes it was! Turtles for the first 10 seconds, then the refs jump in...and OH BOY..he wants to fight now. (Typical McCabe) I guess he didnt think the refs would let them go..but they did, and he got pounded, hahahaha.  Hey look at the good side...he didnt run into the net, or score on his own net last night!"
181791,blaque,2008-04-04 20:05:00,2419, Exactamundo! lol
181795,silveradosheriff,2008-04-04 20:12:00,1025," Right on the mark! Until the league gets it's act together, the players will have to do the policing....  Quick Recall  1. Questionable Hit 2. Marginal Player 3. Headshot 4. Superstar target  Hmmm.....why does the name Steve Moore come to mind?"
181796,kemper,2008-04-04 20:12:00,2232,DETROIT will always look good on paper..but they arent too great playoff wise lately.  ANAHIEM is going to come out on top of the west...maybe not because they are the most talented team...but because playoff is a different game and they have the grit to grind out every game.  the east is hard to call...too many teams close.
181822,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-04-04 21:01:00,39,YEAH YOUR RIGHT MARK BELL IS A SAINT.DRUNK DRIVING CHARGE AND A RAPE CHARGE WHEN HE PLAYED FOR THE 67'S.FIVE GUYS GANG RAPED A GIRL AT A PARTY..... FITS RIGHT IN WITH THE TORONTO HISTORY(HAROLD BALLARD INCIDENT IN MAPLE LEAFS GARDEN !!!!!!!) HOW SOON WE FORGET.OTTAWA WILL STIL GO ON A RUN IN THE PLAYOFFS.ONCE AGAIN NO CLASS LEAF FANS
181845,jjcanoe,2008-04-04 21:32:00,744,Eastern conference sleeper team.........  NY Rangers  however their 1st round match up might be a low scoring affair against the Devils but Lundquist has beaten Broduer seven 7 stratight times this year.  jjcanoe
182039,muskymike,2008-04-05 01:45:00,772," Sorry I can not resist. This opinion is based on experience not a fan based opinion. I played Tier II Junior A and have a few friends in the NHL and the AHL.  Bell's hit was by no means dirty at all. He did absolutely nothing wrong. He did not leave his feet, his elbows were tucked in and he did not lunge. He actually dug his feet in and braced if you watch it again.  Alfredson should not have been admiring his pass and should have been aware that he was in the high slot with only 3 blue jerseys in front of him. It is his responsibility to be aware.  I have hit a lot of guys the same way, and have been hit the exact same way. Never once a dirty hit on me or from me. Its part of the game.  I know people are going to cry head shots, but it wasnt a head shot at all. Because he hit his head, does not make it a head shot. By the book: A head shot is a deliberate motion/intent to go out of one's way to hit his head, not complete the check.  I am not a fan of Bell at all, but this was a very clean solid hit.  Sorry guys, talk to the players across the NHL, other then Ottawa, most guys would agree.  Remember, its an opinion, to each his own, just my two cents."
182180,jughead,2008-04-05 10:28:00,92,"I'm a huge Sens fan and have no problems with the hit. It was clean and within the current rules. Yes it was a head shot. Yes it was from the blind side but the league has ddemed this type of hit, intentional shoulder to head, as legal.What I do have a problem with is Bell is also the player who took out Fisher hitting him knee-on-knee away from the play, along the boards as both players were going for a line change. Then later in the game he took out Redden's feet on an icing call and sent him into the boards.  The guy is a 4th line plug who spent the game running players and throwing cheap shots knowing he wouldn't have to back it up because of the cage. Then again, no one should be surprised since he has a history of hitting from behind and running away from the scene."
182185,Stoty,2008-04-05 11:00:00,2910,C'mon Washington.........just need to win or tie to get in!!!!
182256,Maverick,2008-04-05 15:12:00,371," If they get in, watch out!! They all have something to prove in the playoffs, from the pipes out."
182257,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-04-05 15:12:00,39,Hey muskymike let me explain something to you.You must have sat on the bench when you played because if you think that was a clean hit you need your head checked.Not only did he intend to injury Alfredsson he tried to take out Fishers knee and after watching TSN slow it down and actually show the hit for what it was you can see that he tried to take out his knee.I blew my ACL on a hit like that when I played Junior and it wrecked my career.I played on the same line as Marc Savard in junior so I will let you figure out where I played.So as a player MYSELF that was a dirty hit no respect from a guy WEARING A BIRD CAGE NO GUTS.Obviously an ignorant Leaf fan so keep your comments to yourself and enjoy the golf .I will say this though you have a small point when you say he shouldn't have been watching his pass but Bell came from behind him and it was an OBVIOUS ELBOW GET A GRIP!!
182266,walleyejigger,2008-04-05 15:39:00,876,"what a flawed system, when in one game a team can be out of the playoffs to 3rd in the conference, or 3rd in the conference to out of the playoffs,  but that's a whole new discussion  i'm pullin fir washington on that one  as it sits montreal would play ottawa  hopefully the leafs don't ""try"" and injure my habs tonight  GO HABS GO"
182281,muskymike,2008-04-05 16:08:00,772,I dont feel like stirring the pot so i deleted my post hahahaha
182314,Maverick,2008-04-05 18:25:00,371,"I love how we all get so ticked off when it comes to controversial hockey incidents!! It's like this on every site I go to hahaha.  Oh, can I say ticked?? They say it on cable, don't see why not. HAHAHA I wrote p*issed and it censored it to ticked, censorship at its best WOW!!!!"
181679,blaque,2008-04-04 17:29:00,2419,"Hmmm, i didnt see the hit last night but you tubed it. Looked clean to me. I think alfredson was his own worst enemy on that one......looked like a situation where He ran into Bell alot harder than Bell ran into him. Alfie had the momentum, Bell just stopped his momentum. It wasnt like Bell ran him, bell was coasting and never changed direction and daniel came in his direction so he stiffened up his shoulder and brick walled him. I dunno, any hit like that where a helmet goes flying and its a star laying on the ice is going to be questioned, i thought it was on teh side of a good hit.  Im not a leafs fan so i dont know Bells reputation."
181691,Stoty,2008-04-04 17:43:00,2910,"I totally agree that Alfredsson cooked his own goose on that hit, and that it wasnt a dirty hit at all. I just think that being the meaningless game it was for the leafs, there was no need to purposely crank a guy like that. But being a marginal player, he obviously doesnt have the respect that he should towards a team that is entering the playoffs.  I didnt mean for it to sound like special treatment for a certain player, because no I dont agree with that at all. I meant it on a team basis. The leafs know they arent going anywhere, so there is no need to play like that against a team that is going into the playoffs. If you want to hurt Ottawa, then beat them on the score board. Thats hitting them where it hurts. Especially with Ottawa being on the brink of elimination.  Maybe jail will teach Bell some respect."
181702,Maverick,2008-04-04 17:49:00,371,"Puckhead you must be a leafs fan with your asinine comments. Heatley's accident was controversial but it has been overcome by him, the league and Snyder's family. You sound like the stereotypical leafs fan though with the ""My team sucks and has sucked for the last 50 years but I still cheer for them in hopes of them finishing 9th (2006), getting a lousy draft pick, signing players to stupid contracts* and sinking the team even further only to finish 9th(2007) again and repeat the process**"". * Kubina, McCabe, Tucker. ** Blake. Ok I know Blake has leukemia but enough being a hero, if you can't play worth a crap, take a seat and let some of the younger guys develop. But, Puckhead, I can see how cheering a losing team for your entire life must take its toll. I'm not a huge Sens fan but nothing p*sses me off more than Leafs fans and their deranged thoughts on hockey. Bell's hit was a little late and clearly to the head and it is pretty easy for a player to run around the ice hitting everybody with a cage on.The leafs will never make it anywhere until they get rid of 90% of the team because you can't win with just one good defenseman and one 1st line scorer with the rest of the team suitable for a 4th line role on any NHL squad. The whole team has hid behind Sundin's bald head and sickly skin with yellow stains around his mouth. It's time for Sundin to take a lesser role and let some of the younger guys play, who knows they might actually develop some skills if they get the ice time.  As for my picks. The East is funny. They all have their ups and downs. NJ can win if they can manage to score goals. Pitts can win if Fleury or Conky plays well. I don't see Montreal going far, to many soft players for the playoffs, but you never know. Rangers, Boston, Philly, Carolina are streaky. Sens haven't seemed to find themselves aside from the beating they laid on the leafs last night. Washington could be the dark horse if they get in, but they don't have much playoff experience with their top scorers, Ovie, Semin, Backstrom are good but they still need to prove themselves in the playoffs.  The west is a bit easier. Sharks, Wings and Ducks are favored. I would pick the Sharks to come out on top of that one. I wouldn't count out Calgary either. Nash will have their hands full with Detroit. Min is a tough read, they have good defense. It remains to be seen what Colorado can do with a healthy squad, assuming it will be healthy come playoffs. Would have been nice to see Edmonton get in, they would have had some good momentum riding into the playoffs.  Final picks, Pitts out of the east and SJ out of the west with SJ winning because Nabakov will beat Fleury in a goaltending dual and the Sharks defense is better than Pitts."
181707,walleyejigger,2008-04-04 17:56:00,876,"i'm not saying washington is great or even good, but IF they make the playoffs they have a good chance of being an ""upset"" team for the first round, no matter who they play, (especially montreal)  I call Montreal    and SJ for the long haul  Detroit is too hard to read as they're division is so weak  With the news in sensville i wouldn't take the chance on them  Godd Luck"
181714,Puckhead,2008-04-04 18:01:00,377, Woah !!  Do you feel better now getting all that off your chest?
181722,Stoty,2008-04-04 18:10:00,2910,"Aside from the comments based towards PuckHead, I do have to agree with him about the Leafs. They rely on Sundin way too much. As good of a player as he is, he is WAY past his prime, and they need some new (young) talent to step up.  What they need to do:  1) Get rid of that useless twit Bryan McCabe. Talk about the biggest waste of money in the NHL. Not to mention the biggest panzy in the league as well. 2) Use their draft picks for once, instead of trading them away for goalies. 3) Choose a goalie, and get rid of the other to free up room for a young goalie to come up (Pogge), and free up salary cap space to sign someone decent up front. 4) Get rid of Kubina, unless you think taking 248 penalties per game is a good idea. 5) Sign some GOOD UFA's this summer. They missed out last year for Briere."
181727,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-04 18:16:00,4399,"  Unfortunately there are players that skate around looking for the opportunity to KO a unsuspecting player and this is nothing new and until the league bans head shots it will continue. And for the Ottawa fans please don`t scream too loud you have a guy on your team that is one of the worst offenders in the league who loves to run around and deliver the same type of hits and I seem to recall he KO`d a Boston player last week with the same type of hit and his cheap shot on  Drury last year, of course I am talking about that punk Chris Neil."
