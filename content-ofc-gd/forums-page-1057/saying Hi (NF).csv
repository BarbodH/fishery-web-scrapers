We are moving June 1st to a farm between Hagar and St Charles on June 1st. 160 acres, hunting in the back yard, moose and bear, they say no deer but we have seen signs of them in the hay fields. I haven't been posting much because I haven't had time to get out fishing but still come to catch up on every one else. Family's all good and doing great. Troy is graduating this year, Tyler has gone to live with his father in Guelph and Katrina is almost 7 now. Time flys doesn't it?"
