Great opportunity to see  lots of steelhead, help with a major conservation project  the craa message board will give the specifics www.craa.on.ca _________________"
182076,aniceguy,2008-04-05 02:26:00,1094,"Lifts will be every night at 5 pm. However we will not lift in heavy rain and cold weather (below 7 C). The reason is fish will not come into the fish ladder. They will only come in when the water temp exceeds 6C in big numbers. Today we only had 3.5-4 C so only 6 fish. Sunny warm days are prime. If we have a warm, sunny day (as forecast for most of next week) we could be lifting over 100 fish a night. Or breaking last years record of 370 fish in one night. Then we will need tons of help!!!!   We will be lifting steelhead Saturday and Sunday"
