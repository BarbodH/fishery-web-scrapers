I usually take a couple of handfuls of almonds and an apple to have with my morning coffee on the way. For when I get back to the car or lunch time I usually take a couple of cans of pop. Some presliced marble cheese, pepperettes and another apple. (sucks not being able to sandwiches anymore due to a gluten allergy)  Yeah I have trouble eating stuff with dead bits from bait and fish on my hands too so that is why I wrap everything in saran or a paper towel so I can eat it... being in the food industry I just have to wash my hands before I can eat. I tried that waterless hand santizer one time that was worse tasting than the crud on my hands, so never again."
