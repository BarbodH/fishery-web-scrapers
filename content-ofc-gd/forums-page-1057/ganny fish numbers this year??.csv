182520,fishindevil,2008-04-06 01:02:00,6254,"I talked to a conservation officer a few days ago,in bowmanville and he said they expected a great run this year due to higher water levels,than we have had in many years,as well as increasing numbers of natural reproducing trout,and of course thanks to new york state releasing a big number of trout several years ago !!!!  so lets hope he is right,so far theres lots of fish around,i hope they get at least 7-9,000 that would be great      oh ya and so far he said most people are following all the rules with a few fishing in closed area charges,but overall compliance seems to be pretty good,so thats good news"
