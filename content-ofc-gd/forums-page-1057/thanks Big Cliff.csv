181897,aniceguy,2008-04-04 22:30:00,1094,"I had purchased a swing a way tongue, and after a few initial start up issues on the install I got to talking to Cliff.  After that conversation I felt really comfortable in the install and went and did it.  I was concerned on torquing it to 100lb but Cliff assured me not to worry and explained it to me again thanks..  Any how I havent towed so I cant confirm it wont fall off on the 401 or anything but it seems fine.  One thing someone mentioned about the flexing, with the insert plates it  looks very stable, and as for the 3/4 bolts being a bit tough to snug, a hint..Just have the flange nuts protrude in the tube as far as possible tip them downrards and with a bit of time you ll be able to sung them.  I had 1 that was almost impossible but in the end managed.  As for re routeing the wires I saw a flex coil attachment at Canadian Tire that looks sharp and seems to be able to do the job so I dont think I ll snip and extend the wiring but rather use this neat extension to run the wires  Anyhow Cliff I appreciate your help big time!!!!"
