181944,OhioFisherman,2008-04-04 23:39:00,6623,"LOL Bill, typical 19 year old, made of steel, wasn`t wearing the leg immoblizer they gave him on his emergency room visit, after the doc checked him out, fitted with another and told it doesn`t come off for 2 weeks, until the next visit.  Doc was busy, didn`t get much time to talk, but the accent was obvious even though slight. Brain drain? Ya one of my thoughts too, we are soon to become a nation of geezers with the baby boomers starting to age, health care field will be strong here for 20-30 years at least. First doc I have met that was obviously from Canada."
181950,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-04 23:45:00,2585,doctors can make way more money down there then up here.  especially the surgeons.  cheers!

Although he was busy, he had people skills, a very good explanation of the problem and corrective measures. Some doctors here come up short on that test."
