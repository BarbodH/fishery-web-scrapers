Only started ice fishing a month or so ago and can't get enough  Got out on the ice around 10 and went to a spot that worked last week. It didn't produce much and so we found ourselves moving around - alot.  Caught many fish with most being 7-8"" but did manage two over 12. Both of these females were released. Also caught the odd Rock Bass but nothing else. Here is a shot of the difference between the more common and the odd big one.    The ice was deteriorating rapidly during our time out. Arriving at the shoreline revealed open water. I made my best to step from good ice to good ice only to .....slip! Found myself up to my waist but refusing to let go of my pail. Water was a bit colder then the last time I was in it. Oh well, better to get wet on the way out then the way in,  Had a great time. Thanks for reading."
