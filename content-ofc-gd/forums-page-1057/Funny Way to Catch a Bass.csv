180476,Maverick,2008-04-02 18:11:00,371,"I love Ike, he is hilarious to watch fish. That 2lb bass could have been the tourney winner, I wouldnt have any problem doing that for $100k +"
180480,irishfield,2008-04-02 18:15:00,26272,Guess that's the end of that line sponser... 2 lb bass !  What's he trying to be .. the next Bill Dance
180490,Anatz,2008-04-02 18:25:00,74,nice find!
180500,steverowbotham,2008-04-02 18:48:00,1800,"that tourney is worth 100 grand, i'd be jumping in too."
180508,Ben_Daniels,2008-04-02 18:55:00,435,100 grand you say....yea I'd prolly be in the water too lol  -Ben
180691,johnnyb,2008-04-03 00:24:00,3413," Right on the $$ with that reference, irish!  I am genuinely impressed though -- catching the broken line AND keeping his one hand on the boat.  He's definitely got skills!"
180815,OhioFisherman,2008-04-03 06:24:00,6623,"Losing one over the side cost one guy a classic win some years ago, like a 1 pounder? They show it as a low light film pretty often. Never done that! The only time I have been in the water for a fish was wading."
180859,jediangler,2008-04-03 12:44:00,1923,"I was trolling for walleye on Chesley lake many years ago when my buddies line broke after a hit. We backed up the canoe until we found his line floating on the surface. He grabbed the line and hand landed a nice 16""er. It wasn't worth $100,000 but it sure tasted good."
180953,Ramble,2008-04-03 16:22:00,713,"GREAT video.   i had 41""er escape the cradle after i had the hook out my 1st year guiding...i leaned as far as i could and managed to grab the northern by the base of the tail...my guests grabbed me by the belt and we got the fish back in the net....only 40+ inch fish of their trip.....i earned my keep that day!"

181167,Mark Kulik,2008-04-04 00:00:00,348,I wouldn't even think twice about jumping in for the right amount of $$$!
182140,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-05 03:36:00,33,"Well folks I wasn't in any tournament when I was fishing Semiwhite Lake up by Elliot Lake but I was out on a warm July morning at first light and the water was piss-warm. I reeled-in after working the edge of a drop-off and then paddled my canoe over to work another spot.  I had my Shimano Aero 1000 / Lightning Rod combo laying lengthwise in the canoe with the soft-body jig dangling over the edge and skimming the water. All of a sudden my rod bent and began to leave the canoe. Miraculously the canoe didn't flip but I did take on some water as well as a good soaking when I threw the paddle and lunged to salvage a rod and reel that I couldn't afford to replace ""just like that"".  As I tussled the fish I caught the first glimpse and thought it was a small pike. Think again! When I netted it, it turned out to be a 2 lb laker that had charged up from the deep to smash my jig. I came back soaked to the bones with the rod and reel, the canoe, and the paddle (which I had to propel the canoe by hand to recover), but that fish sure made a delicious shore breakfast.  I am pleased to announce that my above-mentioned fishing rig continued its service life as the luckiest -and deadliest weapon in my fishing arsenal. I do regret to inform you that there was nobody there with a video camera to capture that bit of drama or I'd be sharing it with you.  Cheers!"
