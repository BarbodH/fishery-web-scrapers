Although this does not guarantee your spot (only a deposit or full payment can) it will secure it until payment is required.  Please feel free to contact me at dmil[emailÂ protected] should you have any additional questions.  Sincerest regards,  Dave Millard WFN Tour - Event Manager"
181696,Stoty,2008-04-04 17:46:00,2910,"Wow, thats cool. Thanks for the invite!  I just wish I had an extra $3,100 sitting around. That would be a fantastic learning experience, thats for sure."
181763,bassman,2008-04-04 19:23:00,384,"Thanks, I'm looking forward to watching the tourney on the tube.  It's too bad the AM's aren't fishing for cash though."
181968,Mark Kulik,2008-04-05 00:17:00,348,"I hope you get to do at least one Stoty-great experience, I will be fishing Simcoe 90% Midland and hopefully Kingston, hope we draw, and Bassman , I know it's not cash prizes for ams, but I'm pretty sure the prizes will be worth something! WFN is serious about this series and won't dissapoint!"
181973,muskymike,2008-04-05 00:23:00,772,"I agree with Stoty, $3100 would be nice to have sittin around to be able to participate."
181998,eye-tracker,2008-04-05 00:50:00,89,It is great to see this caliber of tournament in Canada for the bass anglers. Best of luck to all the pros and co-anglers this season. If you can't compete in the tournaments try to make it out to the weigh-ins as they are very fun to watch and experience. I am sure the format will be very exciting and I look forward to watching them on WFN.  -sheldon
