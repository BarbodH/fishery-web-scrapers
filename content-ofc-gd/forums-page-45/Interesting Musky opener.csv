We aren't chasing giants, just want to catch fish, so we fish smaller, unpressured waters. One of our spots is a very small lake fed by a fairly small, but paddleable river. Couldn't find them in the lake. Went up the river and found loads of fish: 12 fish the first trip up, another 6 the next morning. They were in 1-2 FOW, fairly fast flow, ignoring typical musky lures and hitting bass-sized spinners and body baits. Once we found them, it was a blast: almost like trout fishing. We fished 2 other lakes, and all the fish were on smaller offerings as well. The only thing I could get hit on was a size 5 marabou inline."
