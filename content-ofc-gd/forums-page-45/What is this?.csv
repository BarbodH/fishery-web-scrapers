1045584,iFish4real,2019-06-09 04:10:00,386,We had a couple walleye and few perch in the livewell today and when we got to the shore I saw a bunch of those flat white whatever they are floating around in the livewell. Does anybody know what they are? I've never seen them before. Thanks! 
1045586,porkpie,2019-06-09 10:51:00,2521,Tapeworms.

1045589,iFish4real,2019-06-09 14:46:00,386,I've read on internet that the fish should be ok to consume if frozen and cooked property but I'm still a bit skeptical ? Had I known it was contaminated I wouldn't have kept it. Is it common for fish in Ontario?
1045591,porkpie,2019-06-09 16:27:00,2521,Yes fairly common.  A lot of oour kawartha fish had tapeworms this year.  You’ll be fine.
1045592,iFish4real,2019-06-09 16:33:00,386,Thanks ?

1045602,dave524,2019-06-09 19:45:00,4508,just don't do sushi and you're good ?

1045648,Rattletrap2,2019-06-10 17:08:00,1652,Mmmmmm.....sure sounds apetizing! Just cook em' thoroughly.......NOT!
1045649,bigugli,2019-06-10 17:17:00,6138,"A lot of that wonderful seafood like cod, haddock, etc... perch, walleye, have tapeworm. You just never knew about it. Cook properly and you will be fine."
1045650,Fisherman,2019-06-10 17:19:00,7201,You ought to see what's crawling around inside the human body. ?
1045663,Squid,2019-06-10 19:56:00,1656,"That it,  walleye off of my list. YUK"

1045714,dave524,2019-06-11 16:06:00,4508,"It was probably the perch, I've seen lakes where the black spot is so thick on perch they feel like sandpaper but Pickeral in the same lake are virtually clear."
1045715,porkpie,2019-06-11 16:23:00,2521,Guaranteed it was the pickerel.  A lot of our kawartha pics had some tapeworms this opener.
