1045081,jimmer,2019-05-27 20:15:00,2730,"Sometimes you just happen to hit one of those special days. Was out on Sunday with a buddy and we probably caught 25 walleye along with a number of incidental bass, muskie and crappie. Kept one of the smaller walleye for dinner.   "

1045085,misfish,2019-05-27 21:11:00,29133,"You can have the pikeral, ,I,ll take the crappie. Deal ? LOL  Nice outing  "
1045086,AKRISONER,2019-05-27 21:13:00,5558,"good stuff, my buddy has been saying the tri lakes are finally starting to get going."
1045087,BillM,2019-05-27 21:31:00,17367,Nice man!
1045088,GBW,2019-05-27 21:53:00,8460,"Well done man!  I mean the fishing, not cooking wise..."
1045090,misfish,2019-05-27 23:09:00,29133,
1045094,chris.brock,2019-05-28 00:51:00,4053,You're season is off to a great start! Did you get a surface temperature out there?
1045111,jimmer,2019-05-28 13:25:00,2730,60-61
1045125,David Chong,2019-05-28 16:58:00,836,Sounds like a great day! Good stuff!
1045126,lew,2019-05-28 17:51:00,12766,Fantastic beginning to your season Jimmer and hopefully it continues for you.
1045142,jimmer,2019-05-29 12:53:00,2730,"Unfortunately those spots dry up fast, but then it's on to bass and muskie once they open."
1045156,Hank Jr,2019-05-29 17:01:00,146,Good day on the water thanks for the report . Good luck with the Muskies .
1045158,jimmer,2019-05-29 17:53:00,2730,"Population seems good, have been getting incidentals while fishing for the walleye."
1045239,Cando,2019-05-31 06:50:00,90,Nice opening catch. I have to edit my pics and hide my spot lol. Is there a size limit for posting pictures or a place I can read on posting photos?
1045243,misfish,2019-05-31 11:32:00,29133,Just drag pic from your PC to your post. We really like to see back ground. It makes the pic more real. LOL
1045258,Sinker,2019-05-31 19:53:00,8692,They have been  biting good for me too. Snuck out before work this morning and kept 3 for breakfast. Been getting lots of over slots. Its going to be a good year!  S.
1045288,Dutch01,2019-06-01 19:47:00,1431,Chris I was on Balsam last night it was 59 degrees.
1045291,Cando,2019-06-01 20:11:00,90,Thanks Misfish. Most of the pics are in the dead of night and you can't see any background lol. Just want to crop out the houses and keep the water in the pics. That way people can't say I went fishing at the St. Lawrence Market in Toronto lol ?
1045408,aplumma,2019-06-03 23:24:00,6896,Very nice trip and some pretty fish for sure. Art
1045426,AKRISONER,2019-06-04 14:25:00,5558,Things heated up yet there Jimmer? I’ve got a bass derby next weekend on the opener. Thinking things are still very behind.
1045432,jimmer,2019-06-04 16:32:00,2730,"Jeez, the bass are still on the beds. It was 65 on the surface on Sunday."
1045435,AKRISONER,2019-06-04 19:58:00,5558,they usually are but then get off of them just in time. Although we might be so far behind that some bed fishing may be happening.
1045505,Cando,2019-06-06 04:26:00,90,I don't know if this is much help but my friends grandson caught to bass on the may long weekend. I'm not as experienced as most of you guys and I haven't been up to my cottage to see if the bass are protecting where they spawn by my dock.
