1046105,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-21 03:24:00,8243,When I venture out in water I'm not familiar with here on Erie I use my drive lines to come back to port. If I didn't come across a shoal going out I doubt I will hit anything coming back. Sandy rivers and Long Point inner bay however can fool you. I got hung up on a sandbar in the inner bay that definitely was not there when we headed out. Crazy winds on shallow water can change the bottom in a few hours or less. We must be nuts Akri fishing G. Bay and Lake Erie. I have friends that have fished up north on back lakes their entire lives that won't go out in my boat here.
1046109,AKRISONER,2019-06-21 12:09:00,5558,"Re: bass on beds i think people forget that bass spawn anywhere from 0-10 fow. Sure we all know about classic sight fishing but that only represents a piece of the picture. furthermore if you have ever surfed, you realize even bigger waves expel most of their energy above the surface of the water. When you dive beneath them you hardly move at all. Yes if there are waves crashing on the beds in a foot of water, they are definitely taking a beating. Remember bass also spawn in waves, only a particular subset of fish will be doing the deed at any given time. The only time using a gps failed me and scared the heck Out of me was the time I decided to go adventuring into a giant shoal/sunken island field on the western outskirts of pointe au baril. The area is basically totall uncharted and impassable and therefor sees quite literally 0 boat traffic or fishing pressure quite literally ever. I figured I was going to be slick and slip my tinner through the gaps in the shoals and fish the deeper areas between the strips of rocks keeping a driveline to focus on where i was going. Simple, troll out and then follow my driveline back home. Sure enough I made my way out heading south west through the rocks (it was glass calm by the way) slipping through the doorways. Caught a few fish but nothing to write home about, then made my way back when I realized that even while sitting on my drive line, those 4 foot wide gaps in the rocks I had slipped through on the way out were now far more difficult to spot and were in many instances my only way  to make my way back north east to safety...and even worse, at some point I had clearly taken the wrong “doorway” and what this meant was that I was now probably 10 feet away from my way into the maze and had no idea how the heck to go out. Admittedly I’m pretty sure by the end of my way trying to make it through the maze, I gave up and smacked the TM off of some rocks and scraped the bottom of the boat over a shoal just to make it out. In hindsight I was really really stupid. Had a lake breeze kicked up or anything the waves could have built very quickly out in that open water and put us in an area unnaccessbile to help, and in a small boat stuck. We easily could have swam to safety (there was rocks above water everywhere too), but I definitely could have lost the boat that day "
1046110,Terry,2019-06-21 12:29:00,14456,You guys using the word driveline i take it that’s tracks or trails your talking about  I have just never heard them called driveline
1046113,BillM,2019-06-21 12:39:00,17367,"Me either, lol."
1046119,moxie,2019-06-21 13:14:00,1566,"Ill preface my comments by pointing out i rarely catch and keep and ethically follow rules set out by authorities entrusted to manage our resources. That said, We fished them last wknd and will be fishing them this wknd as well and as such time as dates and rules change, we'll keep fishing them in the future. Ethical? Yup."
1046120,misfish,2019-06-21 13:25:00,29133,Will be tossing my goby fly in the morning for them. Open season.
1046142,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-22 03:39:00,8243,"Akri used ""driveline"" so I did too. Better than other names, it's self explanatory, I like it. I will know if the Smallies are still on the beds in exactly 17 minutes. Rod, reel and top water are all set up. Akri, I too have been caught in water I had no business being in. Nipissing in Purgatory Bay lost at night, (should have been more frightening, but at 23 invincible) and here on Erie (a strong 2nd place)."
1046145,Sinker,2019-06-22 13:31:00,8692,"Muskie are off the beds, I know that for sure. Bass? Who cares .....lol"
1046146,misfish,2019-06-22 14:51:00,29133,"Not a single fish to be seen in 3 hours, 5am - 8 am. Never even seen a bed. This area was my go to for years. It,s finished.Ruined by sand build up. Made it back to shore just in time though, before one of the toons went completely flat.  Think I will walk some creeks Sunday morning."
1046152,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-22 20:59:00,8243,"Bass are not on the beds here at least. We got a few hog females about 50' off the shoreline. Hit very aggressively. One took a spinnerbait into the upper jaw and into the skull. She was north of 5#'s. Cut off the hook, she swam away strong, hope she made it. I put a small Black Fury on an ultralight and the small Greenies were hitting it steady. I couldn't care less about Trout and Salmon either, smell like fish but don't taste like chicken."
1046154,AKRISONER,2019-06-22 22:33:00,5558,Today was just another classic Georgian bay opener. Sack just shy of 20lbs but close to 40 fish boated between 8am and 2. Average size high 2’s and 3’s. Spent the high sun period site fishing in 7<fow watching schools of smallies seek and destroy our ned and whacky rigs. Gonna try for some largies in the pads just to shake things up this evening.
1046155,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-22 23:01:00,8243,"I will never get tired of catching Smallmouth that size Akri. I find they fight harder than a 5 plus pounder. One Smallie fight = 10 Walleye being tugged ib like a rubber boot. But they sure taste good, and not like chicken like Walleye. They want 18 bucks now at the Lake Erie tourist traps for 3 Pickerel Tacos and the fish in each is the size of your thumb. Almost 10 bucks for a footlong death dog. I kept 6 Greenies, Smallies about 12 to 15 inches, emerald green fish, maybe year old class. Flesh is rock solid. Fish Tacos tonight."
1046026,johnnyb,2019-06-19 15:14:00,3413,Hahaha maybe it is..... ?
1046027,BillM,2019-06-19 15:28:00,17367,Shouldn't be fishing steelhead or salmon on the beds either.   So sporting!  lol   Difference though is salmon and steelhead don't stick around.   One and done.
1046028,Headhunter,2019-06-19 15:48:00,5703,"But they are still on their spawn and they have to run the gauntlet to do the nasty. As a result, we end up stocking the lake so that fisher people can catch them while they spawn. Seems like a double standard to me... HH"
1046039,grimsbylander,2019-06-19 17:25:00,3016,"Agreed. I’ve raised that question many times in the past and nobody can give me a reasonable explanation. Personally, I think it’s a case of tradition and what we were all raised to believe. Just imagine catching a big female bass, massaging her eggs out into a jar and tossing her back in. Guys would loose their minds....rightfully so too."
1046040,Headhunter,2019-06-19 17:32:00,5703,"Agreed... can you imagine the uproar that the ""Spotted Carp"" crew would raise if they closed the trout season until well after spawn? They wouldn't be able to refine their flossing techniques or a s mentioned, toss the eggless body back in the drink. Where would the fun be? HH"
1046045,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-19 19:25:00,8243,Not a Salmon fisherguy. I have never understood what would justify killing one Salmon and perhaps hundreds of off spring to go and catch another of the same species then releasing it for the sake of conservation. ??????????.
1046046,Rattletrap2,2019-06-19 20:11:00,1652,"I measured the temperatures in the pond last week-end and we are barely at 64 deg.F. Past years it would have been at least 74 deg.F by the end of May and all spawning would be long over. Bass and Bluegill are heavy into the spawn now, but nowhere close to being done. Everything is just so much later this year!"
1046047,misfish,2019-06-19 20:13:00,29133,"Hmmmmmm, I been working on some bluegill fly,s Mr.B."
1046065,Inkman,2019-06-20 11:38:00,19,"Bass are a very prolific fish, I've been fishing them for 60+ years in Bruce/Grey county, Saugeen river watershed and many tributaries. Catch and release, very few people keep and eat these fish. As a former Wilderness Hunting/Fishing lodge owner in Western Quebec for 20+ years I've seen nothing but a healthy, increasing population of smallmouth bass. As for the comments made trying to link this to Cod in the north Atlantic, Moose in Northern Ontario, Deer in southern Ontario, that is just nonsense, ""apples and oranges"".....Come to Grey/Bruce and talk to me and lots of locals with thousands of dollars damage to our vehicles due to the ""bambi"" population! As mentioned I'm  60+ years in this area, the ""good old days"" are now! Never so many deer, or bass for that matter in my lifetime.......just sayin eh!"
1046080,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-20 17:04:00,8243,"Inkman, welcome to OFC. Your real world experience and knowledge is very welcome here. I always say the good old days are today."

Truly the ""good old days"" are now. Regulations are tight, the lakes are the cleanest they've been in hundreds of years, there is no commercial fishing going on and the fish are plentiful and fat."
1046082,Headhunter,2019-06-20 17:46:00,5703,"And we have technology today that not only shows us detailed pictures of everything underwater, we also have technology that will drive us to our spot and put us within 10ft of it every time. And it will hold us there as well. HH"

I've never seen anyone use electronics to make fish hit a bait?......just sayin"
1046088,Headhunter,2019-06-20 21:43:00,5703,"Now don't get me wrong, I think that if it's available to you and you want to use it, have at 'er. I see nothing wrong with using technology and no, I've never seen a fish caught on electronics. That said, I have used electronics to my advantage and will continue to do so, but to say that the playing field is better now than in the past, I'm not so sure that can be substantiated. I think better equipped fisher people are putting more fish in the boat.  HH"
1046089,Inkman,2019-06-20 22:01:00,19,"I hear ya and agree, electronics are wonderful, great new technology and are good tools to ""have in your box"" These are truly ""the good old days"" there were no salmon in great lakes  when I was growing up, brown trout were ""phantom fish"" now they are everywhere,  and that's great.  Sure more fish are being caught,  but people now practice catch and release, that was very rare when I was coming up,  sign of the times and we manage the resource like never before. It's a total sustainable fishery that we've created over the past decades....and that's good for us now and future generations of anglers."
1046091,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-21 00:07:00,8243,"The crazy thing about all the electronic toys available to newbie fisher persons is that after a season of talking advantage of and having the ability to use it properly they can attain several years of experience in a few weeks. People don't have the time or ability to spend their lives on  a few bodies of water to learn it. Before we got our own sonar in the late 70's we generally went to 3 different areas for our 2 weeks of fishing, spring and fall. The Ottawa, Nipissing south shore and Big Island on the Bay of Quinte. And in those 3 areas we didn't venture far from our local spots until we got sonar.  I remember one afternoon my Uncle insisted on heading east from our spot on Nipissing. I warned him that after 8 years fishing at the in-laws cottage for a few days in summer we never ventured far from our regular areas. It took the 4 of us a few hours to get his old 20 foot wooden lapstrake off the shoal we came to rest on after it took a huge gouge out of the keel stem to stern. I didn't know how heavy those old wooden barges were, I did after that day, heavy, really heavy. Our GPS was our arms outstretched to line up the blue cottage with Hollywood Beach for Smallmouth. Start our troll at the burning bush until we got to the Osprey nest, landmarks were our GPC co ordinates, I'm sure they were yours as well. Fishing Lake Erie or Ontario, forget about it. But the stacks at Nanticoke helped a bit when they built the Hydro plant. The old joke then was to answer ""Strait off dem dere stacks brudder, straight off dem stacks"" When someone asked where did you get dem beauties? We still tell them the same thing and they took down the stacks 2 winters ago. When we hit the fish we earned it the old fashioned way, by working hard. I have a couple of thousand bucks worth of electronics on my boat now (don't want to add it up), and still get kyboshed by the good old Skunk Gods. edit: by the time you get the new gadget out of the box it's outdated."
1046094,Inkman,2019-06-21 00:59:00,19,"Oh I agree whole heartedly, electronics are wonderful things....great to fool around with also when the fishing is slow, and we who fish know all about that. They certainly can help to speed things up but only practice, process of elimination by trying different techniques and presentation and learning the habits of the species you seek on any given day will put them in the boat. No substitute for experiance in anything you do in life, and fishing no exception. That's what makes fishing the great sport that it is, you never stop learning and you never stop trying different things to try and establish and pattern out your quarrie......such fun....."
1046097,Cando,2019-06-21 02:27:00,90,I hate those things. I wish it was legal to shoot holes into them when they go whipping too close to shore in front of my cottage. lol
1046098,Cando,2019-06-21 02:30:00,90,My buddies grandson caught 2 bass on the May long weekend somewhere in the Kawarthas.
1046099,Cando,2019-06-21 02:38:00,90,My cottage is on Canal but I haven't been up there because they couldn't get in to put in my new septic tank. But they seem to spawn early by my dock. I watch them protect their nests long before opening season.Then those damn bass tourney guys come in and catch my fish. lol.
1046100,Cando,2019-06-21 02:55:00,90,Has the fishing come back in POB since they stopped the commercial fishing? I haven't been up there in a few decades and remember how great the pike and walleye were their. We would catch up to 50+ inch pike there.
1046101,Cando,2019-06-21 02:58:00,90,I'm old school. I don't use electronics. I throw my friend overboard and get him to spot the fish lol
1046103,AKRISONER,2019-06-21 03:07:00,5558,"There’s 0 doubt that electronics are extremely handy, especially when it comes to navigating. Certain times of year/patterns rely a lot on utilizing your sonar and even more specifically down imaging. Smallies in September like to sit on bait, for the most part the bait they feed on is barely visible on chirp sonar, but on down imaging you can see the fish chasing bait. I still have no friggin clue how people used to get around on Georgian bay prior to having a gps. I mean sure you could learn the way through some of the main channels through experience, but there’s no way in hell you’d venture off of them unless you were paddling. heck I still run into rocks with some regularity while standing on the deck running the trolling motor. I’ve been lucky enough that to date (knock on wood) I haven’t hit the lower end of my outboard off of anything. I basically 100% owe that to having a gps to guide me on my way. As a rule of thumb I stick to drive lines and charted areas and when I want to explore I throw in the bow mount and make my way carefully. I’ve learned a lot of water this way."
1046104,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-21 03:17:00,8243,"What I am trying to say is the electronics today shortens the ""experience"" factor greatly. Finding the fish is one thing, getting them on the line is another. I saw a few guys head out in their $100,000.00 brand spankin 20 plus footer Lund. What I did notice was a few rods had wire leaders on them. Good luck chaps. I too am not a fan of those water rockets they have today. But I would think these huge breakers we get here when a south west wind howls must kick up the eggs and fry on a Bass bed too. These waves we get, not often in spring as fall, has to effect the beds, but we still get them. I had water splashing up on the deck 25' above the beach, or I should say where the beach used to be. I have seen Zebra mussels in the driveway a good 70' from the lake in the spring before. Those beds if there were any had to be destroyed. I think we have had something like 5/ 100 year storms in the last 10 years. Global weather change, specifically high water levels must be a bigger factor effecting Bass spawn than marauding fish feeding on Bass eggs and Fry. A question I need to get answers to. Any thoughts guys?"

1045947,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 01:20:00,8243,"Just last week I saw some nice size males cruising along the shoreline looking for a nice place to have babies. So they will still be on the beds here. I have been watching Smallies make beds, spawn, sometimes a single bass will try to entice a lady fish 2 at a time. Watching them do the nasty is very interesting. People somehow believe if you throw a cigarette butt on a bed with a male there the fish will hit it, not so. I have seen them torpedo Gar, Sheepshead and huge Carp. Small Gobies don't seem to be a problem for them. They eat them as fast as they encroach on the bed. I have seen the fry the size of coffee grounds make a ball the size of a large beachball on a single bed. For the time being Small mouth at least are healthy in great numbers here. My favorite freshwater fish to catch is definitely Smallies. It's all catch and release unless we decide to keep what we call here are ""greenies"". Probably year old class, about 12 to 16 inches long and are a brilliant green. However after the 1st or 2nd week of July it's only Walleye for us and the occasional Perch hunt for the table. They can't even come close to the exhilaration of catching a 5lb Smallie and trolling around for 4 hours can be as boring as watching paint dry, until you latch onto a 30"" Pic. They go back, the 3 to 5 pounders find their way to a table tout suite. Don't forget it is legal to catch and release Smallmouth in Lake Erie during spawning season now for many years. Studies have shown that it has not impacted the population whatsoever. And don't forget Erie in Ontario is still commercially fished. Those nets can't tell the difference between a 5 pound Smallmouth and a 5 pound Walleye. We have trolled through dozens of big Bass belly up after the commercial guys have pulled their nets."
1045949,grimsbylander,2019-06-18 01:45:00,3016,In US waters only!! People will read that and go berserk. lol
1045956,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 02:51:00,8243,"Yep, a small detail I omitted. It's been a while since I have posted here. If someone gets caught  fishing here in Ont. before opening they can say Johnny D told me it's OK. I don't think our fellow OFCers would misinterpret  but the hundreds of guests, well maybe. Thanks Grimsby. See you at the Peach Festival. It might rain on our parade."
1045981,AKRISONER,2019-06-18 13:38:00,5558,"sure enough, went to the north end of the lake and there were fish protecting fry...go figure south end of the tri lakes didnt see a single bass up on a beds, mostly just other fish cruising around checking out the spawning blue gills and sunnys. Then headed to the north end and sure enough there were largies protecting clouds of fry. Let me tell you, we had boats on all three lakes in the tri lakes and the largemouth fishing saturday and sunday was not good at all. Piles of dinks and males around and not a single bigger fish to be found. Our biggest fish from 3 boats was a 2lb smallie on sunday, thats rough! A couple of 4lb smallies were caught over the weekend but they were definitely cruising shoals for food and not bedded up."

1046006,johnnyb,2019-06-18 23:08:00,3413,"2 really great articles that talk about how yeah, in fact, the c&r seasons have impacted the fish populations.  Definitely worth the read, but if you skip it, here's the nutshell version: 22 years of study has been completed on closed lakes in Ontario,  and the evidence overwhelmingly shows a negative impact on fishing during the spawn.  Also, the fishing on the Canadian side of border waters like Erie, St. Lawrence and Niagara is consistently better  yielding bigger fish, as evidenced by the tournaments on these waters. https://www.outdoorcanada.ca/ontario-now-has-the-worlds-best-smallmouth-fishing-heres-why/ https://www.outdoorcanada.ca/fishing-for-nesting-bass/"
1046008,BillM,2019-06-19 01:10:00,17367,You'd think it would be common sense to leave the fish alone when they're spawning and protecting the fry.
1046009,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-19 01:49:00,8243,"Thanks for the links johnnyb. I have to say when Gord Pyzer speaks everyone should listen. To the counterpoint of the above data I attended a fishing seminar at the University of Buffalo with a few of my friends and relatives that live in western N.Y. They live and breath Smallie fishing. Often coming to our place for the Ontario opener. All C&R. Of course the speakers also had data showing no negative impact to the fishery on Erie in western N.Y.. That was about a dozen years ago. We live right on the north shore of Erie. Where we are is an outcropping of limestone with a scattering of beach stone on sand from the shoreline to about 30 feet out where it is approximately 6' deep. I have been watching the Small Mouth spawn here every spring for the last 23 years. In late May and June of 2018 I did not see any beds as the waves crashing on the armour rock wall due to high winds and high water making the water very cloudy. I can't imagine any beds would survive those conditions. There are beds that can be seen this year. Just late last week I saw meandering males looking for a good spot to make their beds. They are on the beds today. Our deck is 25 feet above the shoreline and the beds can be clearly seen in the crystal clear water. I use binoculars to get even closer and have snorkelled with my wife watching this amazing time, in our backyard. Some beds are as close as 6 feet from the shoreline. I have counted 10 beds just scattered across out 75' lot. Those are beds I can clearly see close to shore, I am positive there are beds beyond what I can see. I can tell you that those Bass regularly leave their beds unattended. Around 7AM and again around 7PM, twice a day like clockwork. They roam the area to feed at those times. They can be off the beds for up to 5 minutes at a time. We can see them gorge themselves on Emerald Shiners top feeding. The minnows beach themselves so not to be prey for those males. The predatory fish that meander through the beds are primarily  a gill net can't tell the differCarp and Gar Pike and from the times we have watched them I have yet to see those fish feed on the baitballs of Smallmouth fry that are left unattended. They look like coffee grinds the size of a beachball. I know there are other fish in the area however they, Gar and Carp, are right in their spawn activity when the bass are guarding the beds and those other fish could care less feeding when they spawn. They are spawning at times within feet from the beds. Once those fish have finished their spawn I have seen Carp primarily encroach on the Bass beds. The males torpedo those big carp. Those Bass are unbelievably fast in a short run. I am not a scientist, just an observer. Above is what I have observed for the last 23 years. I don't know if fishing on Bass beds is right or wrong, I do know that it is done across this shallow pond and the regs aren't about to change anytime soon. Remember it was on the U.S. side that commercial fishing was banned years ago to protect the sport fishery. We still commercially fish here on Erie and those gill nets can not differentiate between a 5 pound Walleye and a  5 pound Smallmouth. We have trolled for Pics through areas where the nets had just been pulled and have seen many dozens of very large Smallmouth in the wakes of the commercial boats belly up or floundering on the surface.

1045813,akaShag,2019-06-14 00:11:00,2073,"A buddy of mine was out a few days ago on a local lake, looking for some walleye.  He was saying (and I believe him) that the bass were just spawning. It is an early season opener, in fact the earliest possible date for a third Saturday in June, and it is a VERY late spring here in the Kingston area.  I do not intend to fish this weekend, but I am guessing that a lot of folks will be pulling bass off their beds.  Will it be a massacre? I'm all for opening up new fishing opportunities, but sometimes the biologists have to get out of their offices and raise hell when conservation is at stake. JMOYMV Doug"
1045815,BillM,2019-06-14 00:14:00,17367,"I won't be fishing them if they're on beds, but you know some guys will do whatever they can for those double fisted Facebook and Instagram hero shots."
1045816,akaShag,2019-06-14 00:15:00,2073,yes and that is what worries me sick...............?
1045822,Canuck,2019-06-14 01:54:00,491,Bumper crop of gobies next year i expect with bass pulled off the nests.  Lots of bass egg fodder.
1045832,singingdog,2019-06-14 11:37:00,1047,"It's not the first time this has happened, and bass are somehow not extinct."
1045833,porkpie,2019-06-14 12:07:00,2521,"They’re bass.  There are plenty of them, they’re prolific and durable creatures.  I don’t really spend much time fishing for them, but I can say with some certainty that they will be just fine!  If they didn’t hold tournaments for them, people would just consider them big sunfish."
1045835,akaShag,2019-06-14 12:55:00,2073,"People said this about the cod on the Grand Banks, the West Coast salmon, moose here in Ontario, caribou in northern Quebec/Labrador, etc.  For that matter a decade ago Ontario's biologists allowed up to six deer tags per hunter, and did not turn off the taps when the numbers started to crash.  We had two bad winters in a row, and the deer, at least here in Southeastern Ontario, are only now getting back to a normal population.  We humans are pretty effective harvesters of fish and game.........and when we KNOW that something is a poor practice conservation-wise, even if it is legal, we should try to help out the species when we can.  Just sayin'..........."
1045836,jimmer,2019-06-14 13:44:00,2730,"The first mistake was changing the opening to a week earlier a few years back. Maybe the crappy weather will provide some relief. However, bass seem to be resilient to the pressure for now. I also understand akaShag's point of view. No resource is endless."
1045838,singingdog,2019-06-14 15:16:00,1047,Some of the most prolific bass fisheries in North America are open year-round. Bedding bass are not near as easy to catch as folks think they are.
1045839,captpierre,2019-06-14 15:37:00,2521,Was catching tons of incidental bass accidentally for 2 wks after walleye opener. Including a PB smallie. Was thinking then they were spawning and on nests. Have caught very few lately. Hopefully they’re done now.
1045843,BillM,2019-06-14 16:22:00,17367,I haven't found an easier fish to catch then a bedding/nesting bass.
1045847,Blue Lk,2019-06-14 17:48:00,337,"I wish somebody would catch the jerk nesting under my dock.Everytime I try to do a little dock leveling he attacks,& also goes after the dogs if they wade in for a drink. Only a bump on the legs but scares the crap out of us every time?"
1045849,msp,2019-06-14 17:51:00,1336,"Very true however, many of the US lakes are stocked like crazy"
1045853,Sinker,2019-06-14 22:52:00,8692,Northern ontario is open all year and they are a pest up there. Tons of bass. I'm just waiting for all the bass prostaffers to leave the musky and walleye alone so I can fish them in peace. lol  S.
1045861,BillM,2019-06-15 12:58:00,17367,"I've never seen bass fishing like I have in NW Ontario, just ridiculous.  Locals hate them."

1045863,BillM,2019-06-15 14:25:00,17367,"Yeah, I remember Opeongo in Algonquin before it ever had smallies in it, lol."
1045865,porkpie,2019-06-15 16:11:00,2521,When did opeongo not have smallies?
1045866,pics,2019-06-15 16:14:00,1268,One bad year class shouldn't affect the population too much.. happens with most species..
1045867,BillM,2019-06-15 16:17:00,17367,Never caught/saw/heard of a smallmouth being caught when I was a kid.   So almost 40 years ago?
1045868,grimsbylander,2019-06-15 17:02:00,3016,"Whether someone decides to target spawning bass or not is a personal decision and if it's done during the open season, not a legal issue. Getting sick over it?? Please. The damage to spawning fish/fry caused by severely fluctuating water levels, shoreline construction, pollution, or cormorants, are vastly worst for bass vs catch and release of a bedding bass. Personally, I avoid them if possible. The funny thing is, people think by fishing out in deeper water and not sight fishing, they're good Samaritans. Truth is, in clear water, smallies spawn out in as much as 25' of water...and at that depth they usually spawn later than shallow fish. So while the deep guy is throwing tubes and judging the shallow fisherman's ethics, there's a really good chance he's sticking active fish and bring them a lot further off the bed. Just saying...people are quick to judge based on what they think they know. Then go happily off to the river in the spring and catch bedding rainbows and milk them for bait because, well, they're ok with that. lol Because of the late spring and cooler water temps, If you're concerned about catching a spawning bass this year, better leave the rods in the garage until mid July. ?"

1045875,misfish,2019-06-15 19:14:00,29133,You forgot the ripping around seadoos. I watched 3 of them last weekend ripping around over an area I know the smallies spawn.  They don't have a clue.
1045876,Weeds,2019-06-15 20:05:00,782,"Well, read this thread and was almost worried it might be like shooting fish in a barrel but squeezed in an hour this morning shore fishing the Otonobee river. Bass weren’t biting, none caught or seen. Mosquitoes were much more obliging and showed up in droves."
1045877,AKRISONER,2019-06-15 20:15:00,5558,"Live update from the kawarthas the bass are not on beds and the fishing is tough. Bites are around but you gotta work for them, they sure as hell aren’t up shallow enough to see."
