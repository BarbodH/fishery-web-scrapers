1045933,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-18 00:16:00,10439,From my OFC homies. Need some votes on a contest pic of my pooch. Would be much appreciated if y'all could throw a vote or two. https://contest.mypetsies.com/entries/182231631
1045934,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 00:26:00,8243,I can't seem to be able to open the link. I select it and it brings me back to this thread?????
1045935,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-18 00:28:00,10439,Try it now OI.
1045937,akaShag,2019-06-18 00:30:00,2073,"Looks like it already has a name?  	If not, Chief Crazy Eyes."
1045940,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 00:48:00,8243,"That's more better. Beauty pooch. The hat though? My former wife used to dress up my puppy and I didn't appreciate it. She got my dog in the settlement, not even visitation rights and she didn't like the dog!!!"
1045941,smitty55,2019-06-18 00:55:00,928,Done. It seems you're allowed to vote every 25 minutes. It says I can vote again after the countdown timer. I wonder why they allow that? Good luck Dave.
1045946,Terry,2019-06-18 01:15:00,14456,Done
1045953,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-18 02:29:00,10439,Once every 24 hours actually.
1045954,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-18 02:30:00,10439,Thanks guys.

1045966,DanD,2019-06-18 11:16:00,2223,How bad am I going to get spammed after giving them my email addy? LOL Votes In. Dan.
1046024,BillM,2019-06-19 14:58:00,17367,"Give them a fake one, lol."
1046034,Terry,2019-06-19 16:35:00,14456,Done.  Done
1046035,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-19 16:46:00,10439,
1046036,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-19 16:51:00,10439,Gonna take a miracle to win this one. An ugly  half blind 3 legged cat has over 2000 votes.  ?
1046037,smitty55,2019-06-19 16:55:00,928,That won't work as you have to respond to an email to confirm your vote. 
1046043,cheaptackle,2019-06-19 19:04:00,849,"Did it a couple days ago, responded to confirm and waiting for spam.  Pleased to say none yet!  If it were gonna happen it woulda happened by now, so no happenin' is a good happenin'!  Shoot the cat Dave, y'alls dog is a much better candidate!
