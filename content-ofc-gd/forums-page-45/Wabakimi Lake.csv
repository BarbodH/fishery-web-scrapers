1029640,Pikeslayer8,2018-06-12 16:34:00,336,"Wabakimi Trip June 2-9 This years trip is with my brother Bob, son Brett and newcomer plucked of the board over at Walleye Central, Rob.  Missing is #2 son Bradley.  Flew in to Wabakimi on June 2 a day earlier than planned.  Find out that we probably wouldn't of got in as scheduled.  Thank you ""Northern Wilderness Outfitters"", always looking out for us! Lake level was down 2 1/2""-3""  Water surface temps started at 51 and ended at 61 degree.   Brett's 43""  Walleye Taco...  I cooked the fish!  Brother day!  I like the way my pike frames my head.  Lol  A group from another outfitter Pipestone we have got to know a bit over the years being on the water together.  One of those guys I've gotton to know pretty well above and beyond just a fishing acquaintance, but a good friend of mine who lives in Oklahoma and I consider him a class act of the highest order.  This is David Campbell  In the middle of the trip, at 3:00 in the middle of the night, Bob got up to take a pee and hears something which turned out to be a boat from Pipestone that overshot our dock as it was the middle of the night and the guy was navigating by the stars.  He says that he wants us to use our satphone to call for help as our friend David Campbell was suffering a heart attack.  Well we did and first light me and Bob head to the Pipestone camp where we see the Pipestone float plane and David Campbell looking beat up all to heck and walking gingerly with assistance from Tom to be flown out to Armstrong and evacuated to Thunder Bay. After the plane left, Larry and the other David (the remaining 2) were in complete shock.  We asked them if they would like to fish with us that day.  They asked Where?  We said West End.  They said, never been there.  We said it's a must.  So, we go to the West End and the fishing was absolutely on fire! Took these 2 back to our camp where I made just the very best Walleye Tacos for lunch and back to camp for these two stellar crappie guide fishermen from Tulsa Oklahoma. Been a pleasure to hang with these guys for a day as we were all just hurting for our friend. Ran into these guys the last day and they had the report back that David Campbell did not have a heart attack, but a blood clot in his chest which was treatable.  Praise the Lord!  My peace  Pierogies  I'll put my fish up against all comers.  This is a Panko/ Parmesan batch  Trappers Camp 2018.  Was abandoned in 1982.  This piece of china was discovered for it's value by my brother in the old Trapper Camp rubble.  We brought it back to camp, cleaned off 40 years of bush crud and offer it to our camp as the new ""camp ashtray"".  Comes with meaning and a story.  See ya next year, God willing "
1029642,Jds63,2018-06-12 17:37:00,1365,Thanks for posting .. hope your buddy gets back out there again  .. that Penko/parmesan batch looks great ....

1029650,Sterling,2018-06-12 19:52:00,477,"Pikeslayer8, I just read the previous pages and saw a mostly complete recipe for the panko/parmesan. I would still like a more detailed recipe for the cooking challenged like myself. But most importantly, how is your wife holding up? If she finding the chaga beneficial at all? If so, I can send you a boatload of it. My parents drink the stuff daily and swear by it. We've come up with many ingenious/hilarious ways to harvest it over the years, including grappling hooks, tree climbing kits, etc."
1029682,lunkerbasshunter,2018-06-13 12:13:00,2585,Those are some great fish and what an amazing fish dinner you got there.  Looks yummy. Cheers!
1029748,Pikeslayer8,2018-06-14 16:32:00,336,"This breading is not overpowering the flavor but enhances walleye with a spectacular crunch. In the picture, shows the bowl that I made the wet batter:  I think a cup of flour covers 6 fish or so.  So flour, lemon pepper, mixed with club soda, hit hard with Tobasco, mixed till relatively thin. Dredge the fillets through the wet batter, just covered but not too thick.  If I think I have it too thick I'll strip my fillets with my hands.  Yes it's messy work. For Walleye Tacos, I keep a gal. ziplock bag for crushing Nacho Cheese Doritoes.  Mix in the crushed dorito in with the Panko.  Run your wet batter laden fillet through the Panko concoction and set in a container.  The Panko will absorb the wet batter so give it a few minutes to rest before frying.

I just have this particular trip as a priority in mine and my boys life.  Sure beats going to Disneyland any day!"
919299,Pikeslayer8,2015-06-10 00:31:00,336,"Another stellar trip to Fabulous Wabakimi!  We had good weather for fishing even if a few fronts rolled through. We arrived in the Fort on Saturday for a flight on Sunday so we took a walk over to Rusty's Flying Service.  My room with a view!   Saw a cool Church and cemetary   Saw their new plane and a few old ones that I'm sure I've ridden back in the day.  Flew in Sunday.  On the lake in good shape with Bradley my youngest.   I even lucked into a niceun   What we began to notice right away is that we are catching Blue Walleye.  We didn't know why at the time.  But after researching , it appears to have been the ""Blue Walleye bacteria"" that has entered the lake system to produce beautiffly blue colored walleye.  The pigment was getting on a towel rubbed on one of the walleye. Here is my oldest son Brett with a good one.     Here is my good friend Dave with one.   Dave, (Mr. Lindy Rig) catches a nice pike on 6# test on a Lindy.  Cool pictorial!                The other fine gentleman on our trip is Bill Wallace.  My dad (RIP) and Bill were best of friends and having him along seemed to bring a piece of my Dad more .  We have been on a lot of trips together back in the day and he was just amazing to me how tough this man can ""run with the big dogs"".          Bill with my BIL Pat    The chow was awesome.  I did our regular menu so the pics are like last years (It's in this thread). Walleye Chowder pictorial!     I cooked up some jalapeno bacon crispy and put all the bacon grease in the big pot!   Added celery   And then the onions, peppers and 1 jalapeno   Added the canned cream of potatoe soup with heavy cream and milk     5 walleye cubed    Wants to stick to the bottom so simmer and stir often.    Add the bacon crumbled and plenty of tobassco!    Bam    Apple Cherry Grilled Banana Pie    Grilled Beef Tenderloin   Blue Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye   Walleye Wings     I feel that my Walleye breading for Walleye Tacos and any fryed walleye is perfected.  First I make a wet batter with flour, baking soda, club soda, lemon pepper and tobassco.    I dredge the fillets through the wet batter, put um in the pan and sprinke a mix of regular Panko, crushed Nacho Cheese Doritoes and the kicker ingrediant is Lime and Chipolte Panko. Cover your fillets completely and let em sit for a few minutes to let em soak in real good.    Bam    Bam Bam!      Went to the Old Trappers Camp again.        Bout over!    http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd399/Pikeslayer8/th_167_zpsevpmavpd.mp4  Our group in front with the other party from our little hometown in Iowa!    Thanks for watching!   "

1008302,Pikeslayer8,2017-07-06 00:52:00,336,"This years trip was different in so many ways.  First off, my brother and my 2 boys and I typically go on this June trip with my brother-in-law and my nephews.  My youngest nephew Bob, just graduated from medical school, so my BIL asked if he could have our regular week to take up his entire family so we got with our fabulous outfitter, Northern Wilderness Outfitters, and they slotted us in 1 week earlier.  We did take a detour from our normal route to visit my BIL and family who were celebrating such a wonderful occasion, however, Bob the new Doctor in the family was not back yet, and not in the picture yet.  I was privileged to meet my nephew John's son James for the first time.  Long overdue!  We drove the rest of the way to Ft. Francis with no issues and no issues at the border crossing.  We spent an extra day in the Fort relaxing and getting final foods and baits.  We flew out on Monday, May 29th at 7:30AM.  Was raining and half way there,  we had to put down at Moose Point Lodge on Shikag to wait it out.  Well this wasn't so bad for me as Moose Point was where I had my honeymoon 26 years earlier and I enjoyed walking around reminiscing.  Wish I had my camera.  My new friend Jeromy who was going to Tew lake with us, had his, and took this picture.  Ironic as this was one of the last flights for this particular plane before if was flipped in a waterspout in Dryden a few days later.  Well we got into camp after dropping Jeromy off at Tew and it's raining hard.  We got camp set up and on the water late afternoon.  Well, I did forget my camera and most of us caught our biggest fish of the trip, high 30's pike.  We did catch enough for walleye dinner.  Water temps were 55-57.  The next day the weather was worsening rain and wind, but we were out at Rusty's Back Door when the rock guard broke on my motor and had to be towed in as the guard was sprung and the prop was jammed.  Cost us several hours, lucky my boys are good mechanics and got another bolt where the first sheared off.  Had Walleye Chowder for lunch on this cold day.  Fishin with Bradley  Smoked pork chops and lasagna with garlic bread for dinner.  Water temps were 51,52.   The next day was way worse.  The wind was straight from the north and whitecapping our secluded Narrows.  We caught no fish and settled for leftover lasagna for lunch, but Brett made his biscuits and gravy for breakfast so no worries of starvation this day.  Lol  Got out to the Trappers in the afternoon where a mayfly hatch was just beginning, the weather broke and plenty of fish caught. Had steaks, potatoes, mushrooms and finished off with brownies.  Water temps @ 53. Brett  Now, one of the big changes on this trip for me was that my wife was dealing with breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes.  I had heard of Chaga and knew it grew in Northern Ontario and have seen it before without knowing what it was, ,so my family took it as a challenge to find mom some Chaga, The Miracle Mushroom to help her fight the cancer.  First we looked behind camp and located this.  Chaga only grows on birch trees.  The next day, cool and sunny, we went to the West End.  We kept our eyes peeled for a nice birch grove on the way and Bradley spotted the biggest strand of birch on the lake.  I took note of this and after we caught many nice fish, we pulled in for a major Chaga harvest off of Budner Bay.  We got the Chaga home and my wife has been drinking it as tea ever since we got back.  We completely gorged ourselves with Walleye Tacos with Buffalo Sauce for lunch so much so, we were unable to have dinner.  That's a first!  Fished Trappers till dark!  Water temp of 54.   The next to last full day was another nice weather day.  We went to the West End in the morning, more Walleye Tacos and finished at Trappers again.  Fishin with my brother.  Water temps back up to 59.     The last full day, the weather stated to turn for the worst.  At the West End in the morning catching more in the mid 20"" range finishing up at the Waterfall.  Back to camp for a late lunch of Blue Cheese Burgers and were pleased to meet up with my Facebook friend from Oklahoma and some of his guys who stopped by for a drink.  What a great gentleman David Campbell is.  The rest of the day was a wash.   Blue Cheese Linguini with Buffalo Walleye was dinner.  Nice rainbows though!  With walleye at the end of the rainbow!  The boys got their Brother Day and net up a snake.        Couple of hooligans!  and a couple of Loons!   and the biggest Loon!   Till next year!  The Bennett's and the Dolan's  I will say that this trip was the easiest I've been on with just us 4.  Everyone knew what was expected of them and the chores went by fast.  The sleep that I needed was had as I had the Penthouse to myself.  These guys are the best! "

788872,Pikeslayer8,2013-05-28 16:15:00,336,"It's been awhile since I've said hi to my Canadian friends on this forum. Hi everybody!  This year I'm doing a little 1 day charter on Devils Lake on my way to Wabakimi. We will leave Denver at 3:00am on Friday May 31 and drive 880 miles to Devils Lake and we will be staying outta Haybale Heights. Matt Taylor,  FLW Walleye Tour pro, will take myself, my brother and my 2 boys out for a chartered day on Devils Lake on Sat. June 1.  Can't wait!  Sunday, it's back in the rig for another 350 miles to Ft Francis where we meet up with the rest of my crew and then Monday we all fly in to Wabakimi.  This year marks my 40th trip to Wabakimi and 45th Canadian adventure. Yea, I love it!"
791886,Pikeslayer8,2013-06-11 03:09:00,336,"This year, my brother Bob and my 2 boys, Brett and Bradley  left Denver at 3:00 am Friday May 31st, for what was a very cool fishing adventure.  We arrive at Devils Lake at about 7:00 pm and get checked in at Haybale Hts.  They had a very nice trailer/cabin that we stayed in.  Cost 175/night.  Not bad for 4 guys.  I would definately stay there again.  The owner, Luke, is very cool and is also very accomplished sportsmen in his own right  He has this very cool trophy room where he had dozens of deer mounts as well as his South African safari mounts.  Nice fish mounts from Devils as well. The next morning, June 1, we met Matt Taylor at our cabin at 6:30 in the morning.  The weather was not promising as the wind was gusting up to 35-40 mph,   but we still went anyway.  So Matt shows up with his big 250 truck with Matt Taylor prominently displayed on his truck pulling a nice Ranger boat, awesome!  We all pile in for a ride to Pelican Cove to put in the boat.  Well, as Matt put in the boat, he asked if I would park the rig, extremely cool of him.  Of course, with all that wind, the boat ramp was completely empty.     We only had to go a mile or so till we got to what Matt said was the only fishable spot on the lake, what with the wind and rain sputters, and we were the only boat there.  We were fishing on the protected side of a small low clearance bridge.  This bridge was covered with barn swallows nests by the hundreds and was neat to fish so close to them.  They sure came in handy a few hours later when we were in the midst of a midge hatch.  Even in a more protected area the wind was still an issue so it was verticle jigging with the spot lock on his trolling motor.  We caught pike after pike all morning ranging from 23""-28"" all very thick, stout fish.  Was later in the morning before the walleye bite started.  We caught lots of 16""-17"" beautiful healthy almost translucent walleye.  I wish I took pictures from my time on Devils, but I was too fired up for fishin   .     Matt Taylor was magnificent and we all truly enjoyed our day spent with him.  He even took us by his house on the way back to show us his pet bobcat he has in this very elaborate cage in his side yard.   The guy is nothing but a class act and I wish him well this season fishing the torneys.        June 2 Left Devils Lake early and began the trek to Ft Francis.  Hey, did ya know that speeding tickets are only 20$ in N Dakota?   Yup.        We crossed with no problems at Baudette and made it in to Ft. Francis mid-afternoon, did our grocery shopping at the Safeway and got 2# of leeches at the Can Op.  We joined up with the other 4 guys,  Brother-in-law Pat, and his 2 boys, John and Bob and another nephew from Arizona, Matthew.   We settled into the Rendezvous Hotel and again had a great meal there for dinner.  I ordered the Con Pollo using the Canadian pronunciation.  (Con, rhymes with Ron and Pollo rhymes with Rollo)  eh!   This year our conditions were Hot Calm and Pleasant.  We were the first party in camp as the prior party's got iced out.  Brad, one of our favorite bush pilots spent the day and night prior our arrival setting up camp. I find out that the 3 days prior our arrival a big nasty cold front dumped lots of rain and the night before, was snowing.  The lake was as high as I've ever seen it.  Large stretches of our dock was under a foot of water. rendering our dock unusable.  The fillet table is on the dock.   The skeeters hatched on day 3 but weren't bad.   June 3 Northern Wilderness Outfitters wanted us at their airbase at 9:00 am for a 10:00 flight.  They were able to fly 6 of us on the first flight so I left my 2 boys to go on a 2nd flight that dropped off a party on Bishop Lake.  By the time the 2nd flight arrived with most of my gear and provisions, it was around 4:00 by the time we hit the water runnin. The water temperature was 52* and highs were mid 60s.  No clouds in sight.  We started out at The Corner, I'm with Bradley and we found the fishing tough..  We spent a couple of hours there and only caught 1 fish for dinner.  Pat did catch a 35"" pike.  John a 23"" wally and Matthew a 20"" which we threw back.  Scary.     Decided not to risk it anymore so we went to the Narrows close to camp where we caught enough for dinner.  We keep 3/boat so we needed 12 fish and caught well more.        The next day   Fishing with Bradley, water temps 54* Calm, Still.  Went to my favorite morning spot and found the fishing good but not great by any means.  We caught several nice walleyes and the highlight was Bradley catchin a 34"" pike on the ole walleye trick.  Of course it took a good net man.      Came in for a fried fish lunch with our special Buck's Baked Beans and Pasta Salad. In the afternoon, we went to Rusty's Back Door and again it was hot and still. The walleyes were not biting that well but Pat catches a nice 36"" northern.  We then got into Armada Formation for a beverage and a cigar with a little vertical jiggin.  My nephew, Bob catches a first ever eelpout this day.     For dinner was 1 1/2"" thick cut smoked pork chop lightly kissed on the grill, fresh asparagus, hollandaise sauce, sweet potato fries.  Brownies for desert.  (Not the Pot Brownies either just because I'm in Colorado)     The next day   With Matthew, Hot Still and Calm.  Water temps are definitely going up, now 56*.  Went to Lower Wabakimi to explore some areas that I wanted to try with minimal success.       Went to Trappers and The Corner in the afternoon and it was still pretty slow when we got there but that the water was so high on the lake we were able to get ""Behind The Corner"".  Normally very unaccessible water this spot is truly a hidden gem not seen by very many people.  High cliffs and stunning waterfalls completely hidden.   Dinner was my Flavor Burgers with Blue Cheese and Onion foil pack, salad and Wildberry Pie.  I made all the burgers monstrous but the one I made for Matthew was probably a 3 pounder.  Gotta look after my boat partner!     The next day   I get the pleasure of fishing with Pat.  We've been going together for 30 years but haven't fished together for any but the first as he's always been runnin his boat as I do mine. Let me tell ya, Pat can flat out fish, and he's got his whole family trained to kick my ass in pitch.     Hotter Stiller and even more calm.  Water temps of 58*      Slow morning at the fav morn spot.  Don't say that very often.  I broke out the frozen ciscos with moderate success.   Walleye tacos for lunch     In the afternoon we went to fish a rarely fished spot on the lake we call Retarded Rabbit and did not do well there so we headed back to The Corner.  Hotter than ****!  Pat and I are really workin it and not having much success when we look over at John and Matt's boat.  Well, John is up on the bank screwin around takin a crap or something and Matts jiggin in a foot of water when, bam, a big pike is on.  Matthew fights the fish nicely and John leaps back in the boat and grabs the net and does a masterful job of netting the fish and was lifting her in when the net split and bye bye the pike.  Gotta hand it to Matt, he handled the disappointment well.   Dinner was great.  We prepped this at lunch in no time and was ready for us when we got off the lake other than the mashed taters.  Ribs n Kraut.  Made bread for this but didn't have anything for a bread pan, so I had my son make one out of a box and foil.       The next day.  The last day.    Brother Day!     We go to fav. morn. spot, really pleasant day.  Water 59*  The bite has picked up.  We just sat in a vortex and had a blast.     Lunch was Walleye Chowder    We finished out the trip up River Bay at the Outlet where my brother and I trolled cranks with moderate success.  Bradley caught a good 33"".      Finished the trip out at the Narrows and the bite was good.   The last night meal was perhaps the finest meal I've ever had fishcamp or not.  Took a whole beef tenderloin and cut it up in giant steaks.  John grilled them to perfection.  We also had salad, Fettuccine Alfredo and sweet potato.    All in all, it was another great trip.   Numbers were down a bit and we did have some motor issues but I was proud of my sons who were able to fix the problem and stave off fishing 3 to a boat on brother day.  The NWO camp on Wabakimi is almost a magical place with many, many wonderful memories, however, the boats and motors leave something to be desired.     Thanks for watchin!"

857380,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-10 00:11:00,336,"2014 Trip My brother and I left Denver @ 4:00 am for yet another very cool fishing adventure.  We arrive at Devils Lake at about 7:00 pm and get checked in at Woodlands Resort.   The next morning we meet up with our guide for the day Tanner Thomas for an excellent day of fishing.    He started us out slip bobbering with his boat tied to some flooded timber.    We caught a lot of fish, but the technique wasn't really my cup of tea.  We limited out (5 ea) in an hour and a half so we went out casting cranks and finished the day with some vertical jigging.    Tanner Thomas was a lot of fun and is just starting out being a full time guide.  That night we had a great meal and the pleasure to have the company of Tanner and his mentor, the legendary Pete Harsh.  What an awesome man, I could listen to this most accomplished angler tell stories all night.    Devils Lake was great.  This lake is just teaming with walleye, pike, perch and white bass. It is nice to be surrounded by the most awesome demographic in all the land, the fisherman!  We had a blast.  June 1 We left Devils Lake and finished our trek to Ft Francis, but first we picked up the other 2 guys from Colorado that my brother invited at the International Falls airport as Denis has his own plane.    Another border crossing without incident, but we did have to pay some extra duty.  We had lunch at the Harborage restaurant and the pierogies were great.  Finished it off with their desert specialty ""butter tarts"".  I had 2.  Extra yummy! Picked up my leeches/ciscos & Cuban cigars at Rainy Lake Sports as I always do and then bought my perishables goods at Safeway.  Dinner at the Rondesvoux was a bit of a let down this year.  June 2 We get to the Northern Wilderness Outfitters at 7:30 but it starts raining heavily and the ceiling dropped.  We got delayed by 3 or 4 hours but made it in to Wabakimi about 3:00 pm.  Got to hand it to Brad our pilot and the NWO staff, they did everything possible to get us in.  As it turned out, Brad couldn't even make it back to base and got weathered in for the night at Savant.   We got on the water about 5:00 pm after a lunch of bratwursts. Fishing with Denis, we found fishing tough this first afternoon.  Water temps were ranging from 46-54 and it was cold and stormy.  We decided not to try a fish fry in the rain and instead opted for Walleye Chowder and fresh baked bread.        John did catch a couple of nice pike of 35"" & 37"".  June 3 Again fishing with Denis,  and again we were dealing with the cold front.  Air temps were high of 50 and water temps were ranging from 48-54.  Started off this morning with my brother's scrambled egg dish we fondly call Bob's Eggs.   Stayed close to camp and fished the Narrows.  Pat with a nice pike   Fish fry for lunch consisting of Buck's Baked Beans and Pasta Salad (I made large batch of each for sides for the rest of the week) and our fish breading we feel is perfected.     Fished Rusty's Back Door after lunch and the weather started changing for the better as did the fishing.  Came back through the Chute via some tainted area.   We had dinner prepped at lunch and in the oven so when we come draggin off the lake, we had Country Ribs & Kraut with mashed potatoes waiting.  Great on a cold rainy day.      June 4 Breakfast of Corned Beef Hash and eggs.    Today I'm fishing with Snakehound Eddy.  Weather continued to get better.  High temps of upper 60's and water temps rising to upper 50's.  Winds light 5-10 mph.  Went to the West End for a spectacular morning of fishing topped off with a great Shore Lunch.  Great way for John to celebrate his 31st birthday!  He also catches a 41"" pike and is the first of us to ever catch a big ass sucker though I'm not sure how good that is.          In the afternoon, we went chasing pike at Bill's Bay.  Caught several but nothing of any real size.  Finished the day at the Corner and Behind the Corner.  Denis caught a 27"" walleye on his fly rod with a pike fly.  Dinner was Flavor Burgers, Fettucine Alfredo and Blue Cheese Onion Foil Packs with a Blueberry pie for desert.    June 5  Breakfast of fruits and yogurt.  We are starting to finally get full, time to go lighter.  Weather was ever changing.  Started with a light wind out of South switching to SE then blowing hard from the East @ 30-35 mph.  Water temps up to 62. Fishing with my brother Bob at the West End.  Fishing was decent in the morning.  I lost a descent pike when it bolted under the boat and my brothers lure catches my line.        We ended up getting blown off the lake for some of the afternoon.  Walleye Tacos for lunch.    Smoked Pork Chop with fresh asparagus and hollandaise sauce with sweet potato fries with Brownies for desert.    June 6  Again breakfast of fruit and yogurt and again fishing with Bob.    Nicest weather day of the trip, high of mid 60's, winds light outta West, water 62-64. Caught the pike I lost the day before and got my jig back.  Looked like this medium sized pike just returned from the piercing and tattoo parlor with a jig in each corner of his mouth.  Lol      Fishing was great this day as often happens on the last day of a trip.  Our new bait was very successful. (More on this in another thread upcoming) Lunch was Blue Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye.    Final night's dinner was giant Beef Tenderloin Steaks with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Apple Pie.      Ended the day pulling up the camp boats to empty our gear and to thoroughly wash them out..  Epilogue This year was hard on me as I could not take my boys with me.  One had school that he could not miss and the other got himself in some trouble that couldn't be rewarded with a fishing trip.  I somewhat felt like I lost my mojo without my boys and I vow it never happen again if I can help it.  This year with the late ice-out, the walleyes were in full blown POST SPAWN statis.  We caught loads of 16"", 17"" males but the big gals were not very cooperative.  The ones we did catch were lethargic and recently spawned out.  The skeeters were not bad at all and were just coming out mid-week.  I never used any bug dope and got out with just one bite.  I guess they don't like the taste of caffeine and nicotine.  Lol  OPP plane landed on the lake close to where we were fishing.  They were setting out a buoy in the deepest part of the lake anchored to the bottom and had water temperature sensors at about 8 ft. spacing's.  Again, I can't sing the praises of our outfitter, ""Northern Wilderness Outfitters"" enough.  They got us into camp as best they could and had to bring in an additional overflow flight with most of our beer which they put into there coolers and iced it all down.  Class move!  We signed up for next years same week in which the outfitter announces that there no longer will be a prior group.  We will now be the first group in camp.  Owner Vic Davis said that if we wish, we can now fly-in the afternoon prior to our scheduled trip date, in essence giving us a free day.  Hooray!   Well. I guess that about sums it up.  The NWO camp on Wabakimi is a rustic mystical magical place that we love dearly.  Thanks for watching and drooling over my camp chow food porn.  Can't wait for next year!       "

603979,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-18 17:17:00,336,"When fishing on the last day of my trip to Wabakimi the King lake of Wabakimi Provential Park I caught this 27"" pick with just minites to spare.  Interesting story, so we have lunch that day at the cabin and I made my famous ""Bleu Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye"" and ate 6 fish as a camp.  So we needed just 6 to close out our trip.  i decided we should go to the outlet up river bay.  We don't usually go there much even though it is the main outlet and consider going there a pleasure cruise or sight seeing trip.  We get to the outlet and begin fishing now we've been catching em like crazy all week but couldn't get a nibble here.  What we did see was smoke!  Off the point leading to the outlet appeared to be smoke.  I thought somebody must be camping there so I sent my sons to go investigate and see whats up.  They discovered lightning had struck a tree days before and beaver house next to it was now fully engulfed in flames.  They gladly spent the next hour putting it out with my soft side cooler.  With the wind change that day the fire would have spread throw that part of my beloved lake.  Still needed 6 fish so our boats split up.  I took my boat with my brother and my sons boat to another spot on the lake we don't go to much we call Rusty's back Door.  At the precise moment of arrival I catch my personal best wally.  I believe it was God's will that he sent us to put out the fire and rewarded my accordingly.  Slayer8 "

692849,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-04 03:37:00,336,"When my group first started going to Wabakimi in the mid 70's, we came across the Trapper's Camp in all it's glory.  This camp was well constructed.  The trapper built many smaller huts as well. One for storing traps, One for curing hides, nice crapper, and a very cool sauna. Also, he built this awesome live well(close to the boat) with live bait traps.  The camp was locked the first few times that we would snoop around.  In 1983 we did access the cabin as we could tell that the camp had been abandoned.  We respectively looked around and saw some old books and children's toys and we lucked upon an old paper with a name and Armstrong address on it.  A man from my hometown who regularly comes into camp after us wrote to the trapper asking him what is the story.  The trapper whose name is Joel writes back and tells us that he is from Council Bluffs Ia. and built the camp when he got back from Vietnam.  Disillusioned from the reception he received, he married an Ojibway gal and worked this trapline based in Wabakimi.  This is all that we knew till recently.  On my anniversary trip this past fall to Caribou Lake, I had the pleasure of spending an extra day in Armstrong.  Ever the snoop, I asked around town about Joel the trapper.  I found out that yes he lived in Armstrong all these years after leaving Wabakimi working his own business as a forester but had just recently moved to Thunder Bay.  Dead end. I was told that ""the trapper's wife"" name is Mary and that she lives near Dryden in Dinorwic.  Upon arriving back home I did a google search for both Joel and Mary (out of respect I am not including last names).  No luck on Joel, but I was able to find Mary.  I found out that Mary is an environmental scientist for Independent First Nations Alliance.  We have exchanged many emails since.  I found out many interesting things about her life.  While yes, she is an Ojibway woman and, I believe, very beautiful in her Wabakimi years, she did have 2 young children whose names are Jason and Sarah.  The children of Wabakimi.   This Wabakimi family lived there for 5 years from 1976-1981. An excerpt from one of her emails: "" I have wonderful but also sad memories of life there.  Joel would be running his line sometimes for 5 days at a time.  Me and Jason and Sarah would take care of the place – you are right it was home school every school day morning and then splitting and hauling in firewood and water in  the afternoons.  We lived there from September to spring breakup with a trip out in the winter to visit family.  All our food for those months was purchased ahead – I made bread every Monday. We did spend parts of the summer there also – but we had to go out and work at tree planting and working for outfitters near Armstrong for extra money.  Basically, at Wabakimi,  I think I lived like the many women in my family who  have been in North America since the late 1600's and the Native American women in my line.  My parents were both from Iowa and came from farm families.""  Since they left, Mary and Joel's daughter Sarah died in a horrible skiing accident in 1994.  In 1995, Jason paddled his way back to Wabakimi to spread her ashes.  On my last correspondence, Mary related that the Wabakimi Park superintendent told her that they either had, or will, burn down the remains of their old trappers camp.  The picture is the oldest one I could find.  I believe it was taken in 1990,  9 years of abandonment.  The boreal forest is very hard on such a structure!  In a month I will find out if it is still there.      I sure hope so.  "

692900,solopaddler,2012-05-04 12:07:00,8605,"Thanks for posting that!  It's kind of funny though...  I was paddling down the Allanwater river heading into Wabakimi lake a few years back. At the time much of the shoreline on both sides of the river was on fire.  At one point, because it was impossible to line the canoe through the rapids and stay in the river, I did an 800 meter portage right through the forest fire.  The first trip wasn't bad as I was carrying the canoe and my upper body was protected. The gel coat on the outside was blistering and peeling though...  I had to go back for my second pack and have to say that was interesting LOL!  Anyhow long story short I made it to the lake, paddled directly across then ironically camped on the first major point on the left at the mouth of the Ogoki river outlet. Same spot?  That night I stayed up late and watched the entire south shore of Wabakimi become engulfed in flames. Quite a show."
692928,woodenboater,2012-05-04 13:14:00,2277,Terrific story and great legwork getting the backstory to the cabin. Hopefully it hasn't been torn down yet and they could see fit to keep it as part of  park history (relatively recent as it may be). But I also see letting it slip back into the land it came from as a fitting end as well..

692977,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-04 14:58:00,336," Truly one of the most amazing and harrowing stories to have ever come out of Wabakimi!!!!!!!!!     Was there much fire on the leg between Granite and Wabakimi? The portage you describe is called Sturgeon Falls.  When I first started going to Wabakimi, there used to be a partial built tiny cabin type structure on the west side just past the falls.  I believe that it was built be a canoeist who could not make it through the falls intact.  Back in those days, I found more than one canoe snapped in two in the bush.  Shooting those rapids could have been a fatal mistake in a forest fire.  I'm sure as you are running back to get your second pack, you were questioning your decision of not just shooting the rapids.  I'm glad you did what you did because the alternative could have been............. In relation to the Trapper's Camp location from where you camped,  The trappers camp is about 7 km due west.  If you were to look on google maps, it would be center lake north at the bunny tail.  (the bay shaped like a jackrabbit)  Hey, if ya feel like doing that crazy assed paddle thing again next month, I'll be there.  Wouldn't that be cool.  This is what the camp looked like last year.   "
692988,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-04 15:31:00,336," Woodenboater, You are right on the money.  I sent an email that was unanswered to the park superintendent.   I tried to relate my thoughts about destroying this somewhat historic structure.  To look at it now, yes, it is not much to see.  One needs to think about what kind of person has the fortitude to not only build a structure like that, but to live in it during the winter months.  The isolation and seclusion has a magical charm all of it's own. The cabins that Wendall Beckwith built on Best Island on Whitewater lake are an even better example.  This was truly some of the most classic of all of Ontario's recent history that will fade into oblivion.  This is one of my favorite you tube videos of all time featuring Kevin Callun I'm guessin from Toronto.  Kinda silly in parts, but the Beckwith Cabins at the end of the video are truly remarkable. Solo, if you haven't seen this already, its a must see!   "

704938,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-12 02:30:00,336,"My Report   At Northern Wilderness Outfitters at 4:45 am for a 5:00 flight on June 4th 2012.   I gave everyone at the outfitters some of my homemade mustard.  Got to camp by 7:30 and on the lake by 10:45 after enjoying some brats and packing some lunch meat sandwiches for on the lake.  The lake level rose some 2' in the last week or so and was over the dock.  Tremendous influx of water had me worried about the fishing not to mention the early spring and ice out.  Fishing with youngest son Bradley.    Went to a favorite spot on the lake and we were not disappointed.  We laid into scads of 14""-16"" good eaters and the action was nonstop.  After a shore lunch of sandwiches, we headed off to a spot over by the trapper's camp to see if they were in there.  No walleyes to be found.    Went around the corner to another spot and got into some bigger gals ranging from 20""-25""ers.  We closed out the day at the narrows where the fish weren't exactly jumpin in the boat but felt like we had a pretty good handle on where the action is for the rest of the week.  Winds were predominately from the SW, temps were 65-75 and water temp was 58*.  Came back to camp to find a propane issue where the fridge and freezer were not working.  They had a different 4 tank propane setup whereas 1 of the 4 tanks was empty and it took a bit to figure out.  Fish fry tonight was awesome with the pasta salad and baked beans.    Day 2 on June 5th brought a wind change out of the east at 5-10 mph, partly cloudy, temps 65-75*.  Again fished with Bradley.  Fishing was still pretty good, but we had to work a bit harder.  In the morning, we went back to my favorite morning spot on the lake and did well.  Had an excellent fish fry for lunch and went back to the Corner for pig walleyes.  On the way back to camp, I stopped over at the old Trapper's Camp just to find out if it was still there or if it had been destroyed like the park superintendent had suggested earlier.  Pleased to report that it is still there, untouched.  Also found that Brad, our pilot, lives very close to the Trapper's wife in Dinorwic.  Small world.  Dinner was smoked pork chop with fresh asparagus and hollandaise sauce with sweet potato fries.  Apple peach pies topped it off.    Trapper's Camp           Day 3 on June 6th with similar weather as the day before.  Today, I'm with older son Brett.    Back to my favorite morning spot only to experience something new for me.  Within ten minutes of arrival, I hooked into a sturgeon.  Man o man, what an epic battle!     Of all my 6 rod setups that I had in the boat with me, I was using my lightest ultralite with 6# fireline.  This monster fish was lugging me all over this fishing hole.  I got it up to the top twice and got a good look at it.  She was snagged in the side and appeared to be between 60""-70"" and I would guess between 40 and 50 pounds.  At one point, she exploded clear out of the water and almost landed in my son Bradley's lap in another boat.  I fought this beaut of a fish for 45 minutes and I thought I had her till her last bull rush of a run.  Snap!     Luckily, I was able to enjoy the magnificent Walleye Tacos for lunch.  Muy bueno.  After lunch, we fished a main lake reef only to lose my alabama rig, right away.    Hey, I've never professed to be a good fisherman.  Dinner was giant hamburgers (flavorburgers) with fettucinne alfredo and foil wrapped onions with bacon and blue cheese.  Yummy.  Day 4 on June 7th was hot, I mean blazing hot with winds out of SE.  Fishing with my brother Bob and again at my fav. morning spot, I'd bet we both caught 80 fish apiece starting off with 6 doubles.      Lots of fun!  Lunch was the Blue Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye.  Went to Rusty's Back Door in the afternoon and had good success.  Fished some new to us spots over there that panned out nicely.  Dinner was a new dish for us.  At lunch, we quickly prepped some boneless country pork ribs with some canned tomatoes and sauerkraut and put it in the oven at 250* so it was ready when we got back, allowing for more time on the lake.  Great idea of my brother.  Day 5 on June 8th was much cooler, 55-70*.  Again fishing with Bob and again starting out at my favorite fishing spot and again just catching hand over fist.  It was rumored that my nephew John had caught 300 fish this day.  I would not be surprised.  For lunch, we had Walleye Chowder and for dinner we had Beef Tenderloin Steaks 3"" thick.  Day 6 on June 9th is fly out day.  Scheduled for a 2:00pm flight.  We got out for a few hours fishing in the Narrows with my nephew Bob.  By this time, our anger level at the fish was a bit low and was just good to be out on the lake.  (Is that what one says that just caught 2 fish all morning?)  Back at camp at 10:00 for a big breakfast before camp teardown and cleanup.  We clean out boats and mop and scrub cabin and were ready by 1:30.  After waiting till 4:30 and no sign of plane, we used the sat phone to call the outfitter.  Found out of a big fog bank between us and them delayed things for about 4 hours.  Got my butt kicked in cards.  Baby Loons   Addl. Photos  Netting a pike 4 boats away                   I felt honored to leave this picture of my Dad who so loved this place.      We were catching walleye in 5'-20' of depth mainly fishing eddies on moving water. As far as colors go,  I feel that white on white and white on pink were the best colors for the first few days.  Green was better than chartreuse and when it was overcast and darker, I felt that orange was good.  I really liked using my homemade salted minnows.  Thanks for watching  "
704970,spincast,2012-06-12 09:29:00,3279,excellent report and some cool background history on your favourite locale- I remember reading your earlier post on the old trapper set up - cool you managed to find out some history on it. Congrats on the PB - that is one dark walleye.
704976,solopaddler,2012-06-12 10:21:00,8605,"Excellent report, although some pictures would be nice.  Man, you guys sure do eat well in the bush!   This really deserved a separate post."
704996,Jacob,2012-06-12 11:47:00,186,Great report and stories.
705016,Roy,2012-06-12 12:49:00,13728,"Yes, a great report for sure. Glad you all had a good time. I'm glad that you added this report to the older one as it makes the historical parts even more interesting....especially to the folks who hadn't read the original thread."
705019,johnnyb,2012-06-12 12:59:00,3413,Fantastic report....loved reading it....but seriously...did you have a separate plane to fly your food in?
705097,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-12 16:48:00,336,"   Solo, I considered a separate thread but I wanted my Wabakimi thoughts all in on place and yes I need pictures.  Or it didn't happen.  Spincast, I will email these and all the other pictures to the Trapper's wife.  She asked me to get some before I left.  Thanks for the kind word Catch and Johnnyb.  Johnny, you know I love to cook in the great north.  Roy, I hope my adventures that are so very important part of my life continue in Wabakimi and yes I do want to document it here."
705102,solopaddler,2012-06-12 17:01:00,8605,Fantastic photos of one of my favourite places!
705103,Musky or Specks,2012-06-12 17:03:00,2710,Seriously now I'm hungry. That was an excellent report and I really enjoyed the back story. Kind of reminded me of Traplines North. One of my favourite books on the Canadian wilderness
705424,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-13 16:27:00,336,"I've been saying all along that this story would make for a good book.   Mary says that she still possesses old pictures and letters from her time on the camp.  She is currently married to George Kenny who is an Ojibway writer and author of the book ""Indians Don't Cry"".  My brother is also a writer and author of the book ""Love . Com"" by RW Bennett.  I think that a story of 2 completely diverse backgrounds as the Trapper and his wife who spent 5 years of their life in Wabakimi and a family of American Canadian fishing enthusiasts can have a connection that is Wabakimi so ingrain into the fiber of their being.  Of course, there would have to be a few boat chases in the book."
