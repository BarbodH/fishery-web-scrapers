1045387,Squid,2019-06-03 17:32:00,1656,Yes there is a dewildt in Peterborough also.
1045390,Sinker,2019-06-03 17:59:00,8692,I priced a new yammy at Dewilt in PTBO and they were off their rockers. I went to  Tuckers and dealt with them instead. S.
1045417,Squid,2019-06-04 11:00:00,1656,I just got a second quote and its the same ballpark of 2500 dollars. I am struggling with why it is so expensive a part.
1045418,lew,2019-06-04 11:41:00,12766,"Pete, try Buckhorn Yacht Harbour, they've got a great reputation for repairs and may offer you a cheaper price on that part. I've never dealt with them but have heard good things about them. https://www.buckhornyachtharbour.com/"
1045424,Squid,2019-06-04 13:53:00,1656,Thanks Lew
1045513,Sinker,2019-06-06 13:07:00,8692,Give some specs on the engine and I can ask around as well. S.
1045517,Squid,2019-06-06 13:35:00,1656,thanks Sinker. It is a 1999  115 HP 2 stroke mercury optimax. I need to get to the boat and take some pictures of the engine serial number and the part number of the power trim.
1045528,Sinker,2019-06-06 20:08:00,8692,"Yeah, i will need the serial number. I can still ask around though. "
1045560,fisherman7,2019-06-07 15:50:00,325,Try Walsten Marine. They are an hour away from me and I'll drive there anytime. Great folks to deal with.
1045633,Squid,2019-06-10 13:20:00,1656,thanks
1045757,mikeh,2019-06-12 16:42:00,824,"Ever consider upgrading the motor a few years, look for a 2010 and up. Do you know the value on the 1999$$ I know this has nothing to do with musky opener"
1045761,Squid,2019-06-12 18:17:00,1656,that might be the next option. the motor is not worth more than 3 grand and I am paying 2500 for a power trim??? Doesn't sit right.
1045773,outllaw,2019-06-12 22:55:00,1232,squid. try u.s. dealer prices.
1045781,Squid,2019-06-13 11:21:00,1656,I have been looking at US prices George. A new unit is roughly 1000 us. Used on Ebay is about 400 to 800 usd.
1045814,BillM,2019-06-14 00:12:00,17367,"Buy used, get a US shipping address and go get it."
1045854,Sinker,2019-06-14 23:07:00,8692,I think I'd be considering an upgrade. That part is going to cost you no matter what route you go. Its actually ridiculous. I'm not sure I could stomach paying that for such a simple thing.  It might be worth talking to some hydraulic shops. They can sometimes get the same sized parts and install them for much less money.  S.
1045856,misfish,2019-06-14 23:49:00,29133,"This here makes the best sense. If not Pete,buy another motor. Hell, buy a whole new rig. Toons are the fashion these days."
1046223,Squid,2019-06-25 11:00:00,1656,"Well I finally got the boat back yesterday.  I decided that ,after weeks of searching for a way around going new or paying those USD price, new was the way to go. Actually cost under 2K to buy new and have them install it. Very happy to be back in business and will be hunting those toothy critters in short order. Thanks for all of the ideas on replacing the old one. Much appreciated. "
1046259,BillM,2019-06-26 14:29:00,17367,Nice man!  Hopefully you get the boat slimed soon.
1046261,Squid,2019-06-26 14:44:00,1656,Taking her out tonight for a run and then try for som e walleye slobs in Hamilton harbor.    
1044567,Squid,2019-05-15 18:37:00,1656,I have been watching this stain on Lake St.Clair for a few weeks now and it seems to be stagnant in the eastern part of the lake. I sure hope it moves out and the lake clears up for opener!! Water temps are coming up to the 50 -54 F range lately.    
1044568,Canuck,2019-05-15 19:10:00,491,It is so strange that the surface water temps can get into the mid 50s when the air temperatures have barely gotten there and there has been almost no sun this April/May so far.
1044573,Squid,2019-05-15 20:02:00,1656,yeah and Erie and Ontario are in the 30's (F)
1044578,AKRISONER,2019-05-15 20:21:00,5558,"insane up on G bay at the moment, water is about 48 in land but 38 once you hit the main lake. When you drive out of point au baril channel towards the big water its like hitting a wall, the air temperature drops 10 degrees with the water. Everything is so blood far behind, the pike arent even biting yet and its usually prime time right now."
1044587,Rizzo,2019-05-15 21:53:00,4754,ya I am shocked its in the 50s already. But the sooner it gets to 60 the sooner those muskies want to eat again so bring on some warm temps! The water out there only takes a couple days to clear so not too worried about that. Plus that dark water heats everything up a bit faster!
1044590,misfish,2019-05-15 22:07:00,29133,3.4 C on Simcoe surface this past weekend.
1044602,OhioFisherman,2019-05-16 02:34:00,6623,"I used to live about 1/2 mile from Lake Erie and now about 25 mile due south, that lake is a giant heat sink in the spring, it's usually around 10 degrees F warmer here than along the lake shore in the spring."
1044896,outllaw,2019-05-22 20:33:00,1232,"squid. expect wsrmer water that way. its shallower near st lukes,mitchell bay region. as for cleaner .not until zebra mussels start filtering at 59 degrees and up. plus were in hi water flood stage. what was 5 ft is now 8ft..."
1044915,Squid,2019-05-23 10:55:00,1656,That is where I start in normal years. Water is very high still so it will be interesting how the increased level impacts the fishery.
1044929,OhioFisherman,2019-05-23 14:37:00,6623,"That was a great question Squid, just from what I could find high water levels may be beneficial in a lake, maybe not so in a river? https://thesouthern.com/sports/outdoors/flooding-has-negligible-effect-on-fish-spawn/article_c96a2fd8-12d8-54c7-9fed-22ec84435375.html https://www.timesleader.com/sports/715518/outdoors-high-water-could-mean-a-big-impact-on-fish https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0075951108000418"
1044934,Squid,2019-05-23 14:54:00,1656,Very interesting read Paul. Thanks for the links
1044943,OhioFisherman,2019-05-23 15:17:00,6623,"High water helping makes sense Squid? More choices of spawning and feeding areas? as long as they aren't having to spawn in chocolate milk? and I could understand excessive current affecting a spawn? LOL, I woke up to pouring rain again!"
1044950,Squid,2019-05-23 17:19:00,1656,Yeah it was pouring here in Burlington one hour ago!

1044980,Squid,2019-05-24 10:47:00,1656,Water levels are very high on lake Ontario and I heard that it was going to crest in June sometime.
1044990,misfish,2019-05-24 14:24:00,29133,"Simcoe was up,but this morning I noticed it,s dropping already. Not sure how the system works from Gbay to lake O."
1044992,Squid,2019-05-24 15:11:00,1656,There is no stopping the water from flowing out of Erie and into Ontario. the dam at Cornwall and Beauharnois dam in Montreal. These have seen their water flow reduced in order to save the Montrealers from some serious flooding. Lots of my friends back home are under water but it could have been worse save the dams closing up. I read that Lake Ontario will not start dropping its water level until the end of June and it is still rising.
1045023,outllaw,2019-05-25 20:47:00,1232,"the biggest problem on spawning fish in great lakes is silt over laid eggs..hi-water and winds can ruin a spawning year,especially in southern ont. sand/mud bottoms."
1045030,OhioFisherman,2019-05-26 02:49:00,6623,"Oh I agree Squid, like with the walleye spawns here on the Sandusky and Maumee rivers, those two get muddy very quickly because of all the farming activity south of the spawning areas."
1045062,Squid,2019-05-27 11:34:00,1656,5 MORE SLEEPS!!!!    PICTURE IS FROM 5/23. All the other days show cloud over st clair.  
1045155,Squid,2019-05-29 16:52:00,1656,3 more days!!!! I hope I get my boat back in time for opener. They did say that it would be ready before June 1st!! ?
1045353,Squid,2019-06-03 12:20:00,1656,Must have been a tough go on LSC this past weekend. Water is/was pretty muddy.  
1045370,BillM,2019-06-03 14:46:00,17367,Where are the muskie pics?
1045381,Squid,2019-06-03 15:55:00,1656,"Had the boat at dewildt to check the power trim and they came back with the ram is cracked. So now I am looking for a used power trim for my 115 merc 2 stroke.  New replaced is 2500 bucks and that is a bit rich for my pocket. I figure either new or used, I will install it myself to save some dollars."
1045383,lew,2019-06-03 16:17:00,12766,Just by coincidence Pete I came across hwy 7 east of Peterboro this morning and there's a new Dewildt dealer there now. Never heard of the company before and now twice in a couple hours.
