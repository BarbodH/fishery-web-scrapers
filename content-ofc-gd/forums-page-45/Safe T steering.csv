1045389,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-03 17:45:00,10439,That's normal from the vibration. Years ago I changed over to their NFB helm which has clutches in it to lock the steering in place until you turn the wheel. Just what I needed for when I'm dropping the riggers down. Just point it straight and leave it. This past weekend I just removed the NFB and installed hydraulic steering.

1045429,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-04 15:57:00,10439,I know all the smaller OB's I've had have a tension adjustment on the motor but once you get into the larger OB's they are not used. Even on the 30's at the lodge I worked at they had the adjustments. The 60 on one of my boats doesn't have the ability and neither does the 90 that was on my boat or the 115 that's on it now.
