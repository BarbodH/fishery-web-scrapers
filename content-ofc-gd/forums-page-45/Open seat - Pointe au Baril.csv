I think by fishing day 4 I might be getting a bit lonely lol. to bring - your own transportation to PAB, food, gear and a pleasant attitude I’ll take care of the rest."
1045187,Musky Plug,2019-05-30 12:06:00,398,I would’ve jump in but I have a wedding on Saturday.
1045188,AKRISONER,2019-05-30 12:08:00,5558,"I’m here all week, could do Friday or a shorter Sunday too"
1045197,NAW,2019-05-30 15:59:00,4022,"If I wasn't going to be on 6-mile all weekend, I would definetly come!!  Dang it!!!"
1045207,Rattletrap2,2019-05-30 19:45:00,1652,Hope you find me some Crappie out there? Never mind the Pike! lol
1045208,Musky Plug,2019-05-30 20:19:00,398,Tomorrow I'm booked to go fishing. Sunday I don't think I'll be in operating condition lol. Thank you for the offer. Need to meet up there and do some fishing.
1045216,SirCranksalot,2019-05-30 22:35:00,3291,I'm working on it---will let you know.
1045228,chris.brock,2019-05-31 02:53:00,4053,cool thing to do Akri
1045248,SirCranksalot,2019-05-31 13:59:00,3291,Sorry--not gonna work for me---drat!
1045250,AKRISONER,2019-05-31 14:55:00,5558,Darn! i finally figured something out yesterday too. Got a mid 30’s northern. And a more consistent bite going switching some things up.
1045278,BillM,2019-06-01 14:58:00,17367,"If I wasn't laying flooring today, we'd already be knee deep into the snakes    Goodluck kid."
1045309,AKRISONER,2019-06-02 02:15:00,5558,"There will be more opportunities. im spending more time up here than ever. bite was pretty good on Friday, not so great again today as the water cooled off again. Pretty crazy seeing the water drop 3 degrees overnight and not warm up. We’re still stuck at 58 in the back bays and it’s june! Insanity"
1045325,BillM,2019-06-02 13:11:00,17367,Water temps are wreaking havoc this spring.
1045346,leaf4,2019-06-03 00:44:00,2466,"Yuuuuupppp, just spent a week in Quinte area and some days we would slay them and others it was like someone turned a light switch off.  Not just Walleye, pike, perch anything. We saw anywhere from 57° to 66° depending on where we were."
1045365,AKRISONER,2019-06-03 13:55:00,5558,"At least i am not alone. Ive been fishing an absolute ton lately 4-5 days a week and its so hit and miss its ridiculous. The fish are also very very clumped up, if you are lucky enough to be fishing during an ""on day"" you might think its an ""off day"" until you run into some fish and all of a sudden you are going to get 2 3 or even 5 fish on 5 casts. Its crazy."
