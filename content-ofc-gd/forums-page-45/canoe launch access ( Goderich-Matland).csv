1045990,moses,2019-06-18 15:07:00,36,Hi. I always launch my kayak at the marina. I just dont use the parking area. I park at the road near the Maitland trail site. Doesn't make sense to me to pay 18$ to launch a kayak or canoe.
1046057,squirrel761,2019-06-19 22:24:00,30,I launch my fishing Kayak in Auburn below the south side of the bridge as well as the marina in Goderich.

1046084,moses,2019-06-20 20:14:00,36,Haven't been out on the Maitland lately. Been out on the North channel on the French river. There are walleye to be had at the mouth of the Maitland. Caught a nice 21 incher last year. Just haven't had much time even though im retired now. Go figure
