Can someone tell me which pond that might be and if people actually catch non bass fish in it? A map showing which pond it is would be really helpful. Also, I noticed a bunch of fishing at the ponds today. Is there a different regulation for bass season at the ponds? Thanks for all the help!"

Some years ago it was almost fished out due to heavy pressure from out of towners. Sorry.  There are no exceptions for Bass season in Ontario. There was for stocked ponds holding trout but that was 35 years ago or more."
