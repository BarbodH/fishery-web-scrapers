I have seen where it is written that the bobbins should be replaced every three years, but I could not find it in the actual Safe Boating Guide. I think mine have a 2016 date on them. If they never go off, I can't see why the CO2 cartridge would have to be replaced. The bobbins might be another story, but they come as a kit for about $30.00. Thanks"

1045506,Cando,2019-06-06 06:03:00,90,Do you need a federal boating license to operate a boat or are you good to go with just the PCOC card?
1045510,BillM,2019-06-06 13:00:00,17367,No.  PCOC is all you need.
1045515,akaShag,2019-06-06 13:14:00,2073,"The point being made is the BOAT needs a federal licence (conditions apply, eg motor 10 hp or bigger).  Since 2010, boat licences only have a ten year life span, then must be renewed.  The operator of the boat needs a PCOC, which is good for life."

The boat you are on .. has numbers on the front ..   Below is what they are charging people .. expired, wrong address etc.. easy money if not completed correctly!! You buy a boat and forget to call and update address... Licensed pleasure craft Due to recent changes to Section 106 of the Small Vessel Regulations, pleasure craft licences are now valid for 10 years. If there are changes to your name or address in that time, you must update your licence.

1045544,Cando,2019-06-07 03:21:00,90,Thanks akashag I asked my old man about that as he is in charge of the boat licence. He or I didn't know they needed to be renewed. We could have been boating without it for years lol.
1045546,Cando,2019-06-07 03:27:00,90,"Thank Lex. I read this after my post.  My dad, who looks after that part or myself didn't know they snuck that in on us. Going to have to pay more attention to the government changing the boating laws. I guess they are running out of things to tax so they generate revenue on fining us for petty things. I can see if a life jacket is torn but a faded label is going to far. I'll have to check all my jackets whenever the put my new septic tank in and I can use my cottage."
1045549,dave524,2019-06-07 12:27:00,4508,"I believe depending on the age the boat was first registered it may not need to be renewed, at one time they didn't expired in 10 years. How long has your dad had the boat?"
1045565,Cando,2019-06-07 19:03:00,90,We got the boat n 1998. He said that he doesn't think you needed to licence a boat when he bought it.
1045569,akaShag,2019-06-07 22:05:00,2073,"If the motor is 10 hp or bigger, YES the boat needs to be registered, and it was ""probably"" done at the time of purchase.  My reading of the regulations is that boats registered before 2010 are ""grandfathered"" for the ten year renewal, but it behooves a boat owner to be certain.  Doug"
1045580,Cando,2019-06-08 17:49:00,90,"Thanks Doug, I was going to look into it before we splash the boat. We still have to put the dock in once they decide to finish putting in a new septic tank.  Ron"

I thought I knew most of the regulations, but one thing I over looked with my new boat a couple of years ago was to have a copy of the Boat Registration from Transport Canada on board. I always had a laminated copy on my last boat, but not this one. I just laminated it today and will put it in my boat tonight. I always have my PWC operators card in with my fishing license.

No rips or tears, zipper buckles and straps all work. But the tag had faded so that makes a perfectly good lifejacket that works.......a 240.00 ticket. No warning given and the officer was waaaaay too excited by the sight of a lifejacket that he might be able to give a ticket on. Could not get the jacket into his hands fast enough so he could check the label. Just sad the tax grabs needed by the OPP If the jacket was in terrible condition I would understand, but just because the writing has faded on a label? I would gladly have put it on and jumped overboard but we werre in 4' of water lol At least we didn't leave empty handed. A 35"", 32"", and 30"" pike mean about 3.60 an inch lol. "

1045328,lew,2019-06-02 13:14:00,12766,I've always been 100% pro-cop but sometimes they can be real jerks like the guy you encountered. Couple years back we were at a cottage resort and two of the guests were out in a boat when they got stopped by the OPP. They were both wearing lifejackets and there were 2 more clearly visible on the seats. The driver had a rip in his jacket so the cop gave him a ticket somewhere over $200 saying the jackets had to be in good condition and his wasn't. The guy explained to the cop that legally he didn't even have to be wearing a jacket but the cop said that didn't matter because he WAS wearing one that was torn. No wonder so many folks have total disrespect for cops.
1045329,BillM,2019-06-02 13:20:00,17367,I'd take that ticket to court.
1045331,nlpaintballer,2019-06-02 13:46:00,122,"I would love to take it to court, but between gas and lost time at work, it's not worth it. Just hope my crappie experience helps someone else avoid paying a ridiculous ticket."

1045360,bigbuck,2019-06-03 13:00:00,2449,"They need to justify their being on the water. The OPP up north really burns my biscuit with things like this. A WARNING would suffice. They sometimes forget that they work for us, as do all public servants. I was issued a Bull ticket on 169 a few years ago. As the officer walked away, I told him that I would see him in Boss Hogg's court. He stiffened but went back to his cruiser. I was pulled over for supposedly speeding. I had the cruise on at 80, the limit. He then proceeded to give me a ticket for 'fail to obey sign'. I showed up in Bracebridge court a few months later with a 4 page statement. I met the Crown Attorney and let her know I was taking the ticket to trial and that I would be defending myself. After waiting 4 hours, my name was called, I stood and the Crown moved to withdraw the charge as there was insufficient evidence. I really wanted to read my statement but did not have the opportunity to do so. As I walked by the Officer, I looked him in the eye and said 'Have a nice day Sheriff Roscoe P Coltrane, eehuu eehuu eehuu' I ruined his day."
1045366,AKRISONER,2019-06-03 13:58:00,5558,well...going to have to tell the old man about this one because all of our jackets aside from in my boat are all from the 90's and i guarantee most of them are totally faded out.

If the PCOC is lost or destroyed, the individual can request a replacement from the accredited course provider that issued the card. Course providers charge a fee for this service. If the course provider is unknown or no longer exists, the person should contact the Transport Canada Boating Safety Infoline at 1-800-267-6687 or e-mail to: [email protected]. The agent will check the individual's name against a national database of PCOC holders and then provide instructions on how to get a new card.  This having been said, one of my hunting and fishing buddies was in his boat near shore on the St Lawrence, was hailed to come to shore by an OPP officer and did so, thinking there must be some issue.  The officer checked him for everything including his fishing licence and PCOC.  He had recorded his PCOC on his cell phone but could not find it in the phone's memory.  He also received a hefty fine.  The OPP officer told my buddy that there was ""zero tolerance"" for any infractions."" So the take-away from all of this is know the regs and follow them.  And no, there is no expiry date on your PCOC.  But (EDIT HERE) I see that pleasure craft licences issued after 2010 are valid for only ten years> Doug"
