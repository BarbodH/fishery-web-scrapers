A couple of skunkings on walleye, a broken trolling motor, many km and plenty of hours on the water. Finally found some active fish. Got them on a variety of baits with the big swimbaits and soft plastic jerkbaits getting most of the fish. They did not want the jerk bait at all for some reason. The new Minn Kota maxxum performed flawlessly. I should have got one long ago. Love the responsiveness of the cable rive        "
1045186,lew,2019-05-30 12:00:00,12766,"Outstanding, bunch of nice fish for sure !!"
1045189,AKRISONER,2019-05-30 12:10:00,5558,"Holy crap, very very nice. I’m still struggling like heck to find active fish. I had one window one morning and since then I can’t seem to get much consistency going at all. Interesting comment about the jerkbait, maybe I need to give the swimbait more of a dunk.  Well done!"
1045194,wantabigone,2019-05-30 13:41:00,97,Nice colours on those fish. Congrats
1045198,NAW,2019-05-30 16:00:00,4022,Some really nice fish right there!!!
1045206,kickingfrog,2019-05-30 19:43:00,8333,Our pike fishing has been slow as well. We put it up to the wet cold spring in these parts. Also unusual is we've not caught any fish over 33 inches but at the same time we've only caught one hammer handle. Just about all out fish have been on husky jerks (14cm) but that is our goto bait so it also gets used the most.
1045209,Musky Plug,2019-05-30 20:21:00,398,Some beauty gators right there! Nice job!
1045212,misfish,2019-05-30 20:58:00,29133,Thats some real healthy fish there. Love the deep green colors. Well done.
1045214,scuro2,2019-05-30 21:47:00,904,Nice to see the spring pike posts. That damn winter is over!
1045219,chris.brock,2019-05-30 23:36:00,4053,"Looks like you guys persisted and got some biggies. Beauties! Telly forgot to tie his draw string, lol."
1045222,Hack_Fisherman,2019-05-31 00:40:00,720,"Sweet mutha, those are some great fish. They don’t make them like that around here!"
1045224,AKRISONER,2019-05-31 00:57:00,5558,Gave the big white paddle tail a dunk this afternoon and success! Got my first half decent fish of the season. Thanks for the tip!
1045226,Rizzo,2019-05-31 02:23:00,4754,wow those are some serious pike. I am gonna assume that is NOT southern ontario
1045229,Duckie,2019-05-31 02:58:00,305,amazing fish. well done.
1045233,BillM,2019-05-31 03:15:00,17367,Lots of big pike in gBay/Muskokas      Just gotta work for them.
1045242,Hank Jr,2019-05-31 10:38:00,146,Great day on the water we only catch them that size on fly -in trips  . Thanks for the pictures and report .
1045245,AKRISONER,2019-05-31 12:44:00,5558,"Maybe more spread out because the Great Lakes are big, but there are absolute monsters around. Craziest one, have you seen the pike coming out of lake O right in Toronto?"
1045246,JoshS,2019-05-31 13:16:00,729,Nice buddy! We didn't make it back out. Might do some local during the week next week. Hopefully you get back out this weekend.
1045257,Sinker,2019-05-31 19:50:00,8692,Nice fish man! You certainly have a knack with them water wolfs!  S.
