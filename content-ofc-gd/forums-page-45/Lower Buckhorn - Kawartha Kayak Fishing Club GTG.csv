If anyone would like to join us please see the link at the bottom of this post. Lower Buckhorn is a gorgeous lake, with great fishing. Unfortunately there are no public launches so there is a $10 fee per vehicle (car/truck not kayak) to launch and park at the private resort we're meeting at. Please consider this an open invite to join us. There is no club cost, we only ask that you join our FB group and complete a liability waiver (this can be done on site on Saturday). I hope to see some new faces there! If you can't make it and/or you're fishing somewhere else, good luck and tight Â lines! Dutch https://www.facebook.com/events/2254357191470926/?ti=icl "
