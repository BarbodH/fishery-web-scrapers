What is going on here?  Press time and correction cost thousands. we had a standard Ontario map we used  with major highways but all of the sudden a “let me look good” person  who pushed for  the road decided the map had to be changed, never mind the cost, the map got changed. Lost little sleep on that one. hope it’s well used!"
