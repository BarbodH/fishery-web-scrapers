1045948,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 01:43:00,8243,"This is a great thing for kids as well as the game of Basketball. There is a future generation of Canadian players out there that will be positively affected by this historic win. Kids can play and all they need is a 20 buck ball and a hoop on a pole. I know there are plenty of OFCers here that have spent many thousands of Loonies putting their kids through hockey. I have more than a few friends that had very talented kids playing hockey. Before they went to the next level the parents were interviewed and told what the financial burden would be. Before the kid hit the ice if it wasn't in the family budget the kid wasn't given a tryout. I don't know if it's the same today. There are many kids that would have been NHLers in Canada and other countries that will never have even learned to skate because they can not afford it. Basketball is affordable to those that are underprivileged, like I said a ball and a basket is all they need. And it's huge for the NBA that wants to go internationally. I'm happy for the fans, real and bandwagoners. That parade was insane. The fanaticism leading up to the championship and post win celebrations for the Jays when they 2 peted the World Series wins didn't come close to the fervor we have seen in the last month. Good to see. Enjoy."
1046219,cisco,2019-06-25 08:52:00,597,"I remember when lotteries were going to help fund sports for kids, wheelchair ramps and such. That's how the 'evil' lottery was sold to us. Then shortly after starting the $ all went into the same place our other tax dollars go. Nowhere. Would have been a great thing to set up a way to help pay for kids playing hockey and other sports."
1045657,David Chong,2019-06-10 18:42:00,836,"Would be shocked if Durant comes back! Remember he is going into free agency and he's not going to risk a potentially massive contract to play in a game when he's not 100%. Can't wait til tonight, a good friend of mine who is a season ticket holder & I are going! Should be a blast!!!!"
1045671,AKRISONER,2019-06-10 20:22:00,5558,"lucky duck! durant says hes playing...as they are saying online  If durant is durant at 100%, curry and thompson are hitting their threes, cousins is a defensive beast, i can see the raps winning in 5  LETS GO RAPTORS"
1045693,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-11 01:11:00,10439,It's go time!!!!  
1045697,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-11 02:21:00,10439,Seems I was wrong. I figured KD wouldn't make it through the 1st quarter. At least he gave it a go and was playing well until..................
1045706,AKRISONER,2019-06-11 12:42:00,5558,"Man...the close up of his achillies bursting is wild  jeez when they went up 6...I actually got the feeling, the actual feeling of omg this is it, I was actually shaking. I’m 31 years old and I’ve never seen my team win it all...I guess I’ll have to wait"
1045712,jimmer,2019-06-11 15:24:00,2730,"I think everyone was thinking the same thing, but then again it's the GSW's they're playing."
1045723,dave524,2019-06-11 20:44:00,4508,"That was the biggest let down by a Toronto sports team since May 13th, 2013. Just hoping now it doesn't go 7 games, cause I got a bad feeling on how that will turn out"
1045732,chris.brock,2019-06-11 23:24:00,4053,"Akri, you mentioned KD will probably be out of game shape after being injured for so long, I was thinking that makes sense, then right out of the gate, his first three 3's were all net I was thinking ""omg, this guy's awesome, we're screwed"", lol"
1045744,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-12 02:56:00,10439,I told my buds that KD shouldn't be playing and if he did he would get hurt and be gone in the first 10 minutes. It took 14!!!  ? Now he's most likely gone for the entire 2019\2020 season. Not what you want to have happen on your contract year.
1045746,cisco,2019-06-12 04:04:00,597,IMHO the Raps have to up their 3-point percentage average and or drop the Wars 3 point percentage. The Wars win with 3 pointers. Last game the Raps were 25% and the wars 47%. Raps also need to keep drawing fouls by pushing paint and doing more double pumps before layup lift offs. Raps need to give the Wars foul trouble concerns to soften the D while gaining free throw line 3s nearing game end. Also making them lose rythm and gaining stiffness in their joints standing by for free throws slows and stiffens the Wars.
1045821,chris.brock,2019-06-14 01:10:00,4053,"I got a beef. The start times for the games. If a team has home court, the team should set the start time, not the league. My wife had a B Ball scholarship in the US, she stayed up north and played varsity, she coaches high school girls B Ball, she loves B Ball. She's caught Raptors fever here in the GTA but she hasn't watched a single game because of the late starts. She's either too dedicated to her work to stay up late during the week, or too tired from her work to stay up late on the weekend and watch a game. It pisses me off. oh yeah, go Raptors! "
1045824,chris.brock,2019-06-14 03:04:00,4053,"with that klay thompson drama queen crap, I'm turning it off, I'm out, I don't watch WWF, soccer or now the NBA"
1045827,glen,2019-06-14 04:03:00,2641,Wtg raptors.   Right down to the wire.  Great game.
1045828,David Chong,2019-06-14 04:05:00,836,"An awesome finish to a great year for the Toronto Raptors, 2019 NBA Champions! A truly resilient team that played as a team! Congrats to all!"
1045829,Chuck Enwinde,2019-06-14 04:28:00,247,I agree.  Home court should dictate the start times but it's all about TV.  I'm sure Golden State would prefer games that start at 10:30 eastern when at home just as we'd like 7:30.  9:00 seems like the compromise.  Oh and WHOOOOOHOOO!!!!
1045846,mikeh,2019-06-14 17:42:00,824,"Great game by the Raptors and GSW, went down to the last few seconds"
1045851,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-14 21:32:00,10439,This is gold!!!! ?? 
1045855,cisco,2019-06-14 23:11:00,597,Great game and outcome for sure!!! Raps got their 3 point percentage up to same as the Wars... 47% or so. Fred IMO took them over the edge with his last buncha 3 pointers after others were too tired to be accurate long distance anymore. Hope he gets a big contract raise and extension over the two year deal he started with. 
1045860,smitty55,2019-06-15 03:52:00,928,"I can't not see them giving  Sr. a good contract, he's the perfect off the bench point guard. If Kyle was injured they would have no problem starting Fred."
1045917,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-17 15:01:00,10439,Quite the turn out in TO for the parade. https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/watch-live-toronto-raptors-championship-parade/

1045921,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-17 16:07:00,10439,LOL!!! The Gardiner is down to one lane because people are getting out of their cars to watch the parade. https://www.bardown.com/people-are-getting-out-of-their-car-on-the-highway-to-catch-a-glimpse-of-the-raptors-parade-1.1323952?fbclid=IwAR339EFjjEZ6CK6p_9lXws_pKLm8G2hZalyLBLEpetgVmqBFuXci_yr0LnU 
1045924,Squid,2019-06-17 18:09:00,1656,The crowds could reach 2 million today according to the reporters covering the parade.
1045925,BillM,2019-06-17 18:48:00,17367,Crazy!
1045931,captpierre,2019-06-17 21:48:00,2521,I must have been the only person working today based on the crowds. ?
1045035,captpierre,2019-05-26 12:09:00,2521,Never followed Basketball.  Gotta admit it’s been fun to watch. Mainly the last 10 minutes. ?
1045037,dave524,2019-05-26 12:30:00,4508,"At halftime I was thinking , CRAP, they are going back to Milwaukee and will probably lose the series, Superman Kawhi Leonard came through yet again, that guy is by far the best player on any team so far in any of the playoff series, definitely a front runner for MVP."
1045040,davey buoy,2019-05-26 13:34:00,5505,"It was awesome,they always seem to make it hard on themselves with the rough starts !!!!"
1045047,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-26 18:55:00,8243,"Followed Basket Ball closely when I played in High School. Not since. I have seen 1 game live when they had their rookie season and haven't seen more than 1/4 since. I always said they should just make the score 85 all and play the last 5 minutes that takes about 25 mins to play.  I'll check in on the score and watch the last 5 minutes. Hope they win, we can use a big win for Canada even though I don't think there is a single Canuck on the hardwood and it's great for the die hards, Raptor fans can be rabid. I bet many of the players couldn't find Toronto on a map before they landed there, still might not."
1045048,captpierre,2019-05-26 19:00:00,2521,I think the Jays winning the World Series made an impression on lots of Yanks. It put Toronto/Canada on the map for many ignorant Americans that thought we live in igloos.  Ditto Raptors. Perhaps.
1045050,misfish,2019-05-26 19:31:00,29133,WE THE NORTH   GOT THIS ONE
1045053,colin519,2019-05-26 23:24:00,101,"i don't mind admitting that i'm just jumping on the bandwagon. it was fun and it is meaningful to the player and the fans and that kind of sports event is always exciting to get involved in. It's great that we play lots of organized basketball in school in Canada, i think it makes it easier for people to pick up the game and get deeper into it as you watch. actually wish the MLS would get rid of the playoffs in North American soccer so the regular season games would matter like in English football. that would get us another entertaining product from MLSE. anyway, great game very entertaining and i'll be on the wagon for Game 1. Gotta say that bringing in Lieweicki for a bit really seemed to kick start things a few years ago for MLSE. He hired Ujiri, Shanahan and Michael Bradley and Sebastian Giovinco on the football side."
1045056,Rizzo,2019-05-27 01:41:00,4754,Been a big fan since the first season but great to have some bandwagon jumpers on for the ride!
1045058,chris.brock,2019-05-27 01:53:00,4053,notice the start times for the games? Having the Raptors in the final is like having the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup final. The NBA is hoping for some west coast viewership with the later start times. Go Raptors! .
1045067,AKRISONER,2019-05-27 12:20:00,5558,glad this happened for this city...couldnt rely on the friggin leafs to do anything. In the grand scheme of things this is bigger than hockey anyways. You think americans dont care about the raptors...imagine how little they care about the leafs lol
1045083,colin519,2019-05-27 20:23:00,101,"wow 96, i remember that. i wish they'd go every other day. 18 days to play a 7 game series"
1045091,David Chong,2019-05-27 23:30:00,836,"Been a huge fan of the Raptors since their inception 24 years ago! Kawhi Leonard, whether he stays or goes has helped them make history and hoping they can beat the Golden State Warriors. They beat them twice in the regular season but this is the playoffs! If they can play defence as they did against Milwaukee then they definitely have a good chance, VanVleet, Ibaka & Powell need to keep producing off the bench and Danny Green needs to find his shot! #WeTheNorth #LetsGoRaptors "
1045234,chris.brock,2019-05-31 03:37:00,4053,Siakam!
1045235,David Chong,2019-05-31 03:43:00,836,History made again! Let’s go Raptors!
1045236,glen,2019-05-31 03:47:00,2641,Great game.  Go raptors.
1045369,mikeh,2019-06-03 14:38:00,824,"Tough loss, if they made some of the shots near the end of the game ,it would be 2-0. They really need Lowry taking some 3 pointers at the end of the game."
1045372,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-03 14:52:00,10439,Their FG% was abysmal in game 2. If they hit half of the shots they missed they would have won by 20 points or more.
1045373,AKRISONER,2019-06-03 14:52:00,5558,"GS is good...im glad the raptors are hanging with them. Their D is keeping it close and giving them an opportunity to win every night. Hopefully the series goes long. Win or lose I am loving watching this happen and what its doing for the city. I still say it every game, ""i cant believe this is finally happening during my life time"" Now if only the leafs could do it too...man its a fun ride, and I think we have all already won watching them get this far."
1045376,LeXXington,2019-06-03 15:29:00,1928,Hard game to watch in the 3rd.. The entire bar yelling noooooo every time they tried to go for a 3 point shot.
1045388,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-03 17:42:00,10439,"My favorite Toronto sports moment in my life so far was the Jays winning their first world series. I was at the dome with my buddy and 35,000 of our closest friends watching the game on the jumbotron. We then went to Young Street and joined in the best street party ever."
1045507,misfish,2019-06-06 10:55:00,29133,"Nothing like taking it right to them, in their own barn. Raps in 5"
1045542,Rizzo,2019-06-07 01:20:00,4754,"if Durant and Klay stay out Raps might do it in 5....but I don't see that happening. If its just Klay back I still like Raps odds, but if KD comes back, itll be tough"
1045547,chris.brock,2019-06-07 03:30:00,4053,"Hey Kyle Lowry, this is how to deal with annoying fans   "
1045550,AKRISONER,2019-06-07 13:19:00,5558,"Kd isn’t coming back. He was supposed to be back games 1-2-3 and 4 and still isn’t back. It’s all mind games not allowing Nick nurse to adjust his rotations at practice due to not knowing whether Durant will play or not.  even if he does come back, and same goes with Thompson at this point, they are going to be in rough shape. Both have bad strains, which if you’ve ever pulled a hammy, a calf or a groin...good luck  you want to play NBA finals caliber basketball like that? Good luck"
1045606,pics,2019-06-09 20:56:00,1268,I have to work Monday night.. hopefully I can watch a bit of the game on my break.. it would be fun seeing them win at home..
