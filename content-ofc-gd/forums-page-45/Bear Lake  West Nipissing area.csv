434864,Muskieman,2010-02-19 21:52:00,2472,Bear Lake?  Highway 805 North of River Valley? or South of Lavigne  on Hwy 64?  North of River ..... Splake  crystal clear waters.  South of Lavigne .... Walleye ... Perch.... Pike ..(smallies and muskies and panfish)...stained waters   lots of weed beds and rocks ... mostly private property.  Buddy  has been doing well this year with some fish in the freezer ... enough for his Good-Friday fishfry.  Good Luck!  RFS
