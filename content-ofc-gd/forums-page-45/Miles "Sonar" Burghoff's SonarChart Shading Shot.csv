It definitely gives a different look hi-light the underwater topography. Miles is a rookie this year on the FLW Tour and is having a tremendous rookie season. Another interesting note, Miles is the son of Gary ""Radar O'Reilly"" Burghoff of MASH fame! "

1045998,Mike Pike,2019-06-18 19:37:00,1332,"Hey David, Miles must be a chip off the ol' block, as they say.  I remember one of the very first Bob Izumi fishing shows( maybe the first season )when Bob fished with Gary Burghoff.  I never forgot it because I used to love MASH as a kid."
1046003,David Chong,2019-06-18 21:59:00,836,Gary was on Bob’s Show a couple of times! I’m pretty sure that Miles was on as a child as well! Awesome that he’s grown up and fishing the FLW Tour! Great kid!
