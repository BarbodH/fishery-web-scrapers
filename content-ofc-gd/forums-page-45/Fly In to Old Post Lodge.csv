1045797,squirrel761,2019-06-13 17:52:00,30,Just got back from a fly in to Old Post Lodge On Lake St Joseph near Pickle Lake. First time up there this early. Usually go in July when it's warmer. Fishing was amazing. The guide put us on Walleye and Pike very day. Didn't seem to matter where we went we caught fish. I walked to the back of the island the lodge is on and fished off the rocks. Caught and released 35 Walleye in 1 1/2 hours. Best ever back there. Was cold a few days in the morning but we dressed for it. Definitely a great place to go if you like to fish.  
1045801,NAW,2019-06-13 20:19:00,4022,Sounds like a great trip! I spent the first 4 years of my life in Pickle Lake.  Would love to return for a fishing / hunting trip one day. My dad was the LCBO manager up there for 10 years..
1045802,misfish,2019-06-13 20:21:00,29133,Nice. What kind of boat is that ? It looks nice and wide.
1045803,squirrel761,2019-06-13 20:32:00,30,The boat is a 18' Kingfisher. They are new this year. Come with 50 hp Yamahas
