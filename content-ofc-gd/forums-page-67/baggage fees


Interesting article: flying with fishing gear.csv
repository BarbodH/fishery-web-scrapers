1025626,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-03 16:09:00,8243,It isn't the cost of extra baggage that worries me it is the good chance they lose my stuff on the way to my vacation destination. I travelled a lot and on more then a few occasions either my tackle or my Golf Clubs were either late 3 days into my short trip or never showed up at all. I started to Fed Ex my stuff ahead an lug it back on the plan. Never a lost anything again.
1025641,kickingfrog,2018-04-03 20:33:00,8333,I've been going back and forth on what I'm going to do this summer for the family trip to Florida. I'm leaning towards shipping it beforehand but since this isn't a fishing trip and much more of a family/Disney trip. I've got some travel rods so I'll look into the airlines policy on sports equipment.
