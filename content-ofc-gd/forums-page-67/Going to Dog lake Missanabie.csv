We are going on the first week of July. Trying to do early research as only one of the friends coming has fishing experience. Any experiences and tips to share. All advice would be appreciated!"

I never did figure out the lake trout, which were suspended in good numbers.  A manual downrigger would have been a good idea to bring along. 5. Avoid the cabin above the dock and to the left as you look at the lodge.  (Cabin #6) The stove in that one could hardly boil water, and it was a DISASTER for trying to fry fish.  Even with all the windows open it is dark and dreary as well. 6. There is a bay to your left as you head away from the dock.  Fish the left shore of that bay for walleye in good numbers (but not much for size) 7.  Don't cheap out on rain gear.  That lake whips up BIG and chances are good that you are going to get wet at least once. 8. There is one funny turn up there on your way to the launch at Missinabie.  I forget exactly where it was, but the highway numbers are tricky, probably 651.  If memory serves me, the sign pointed one way but the road went another. Good luck! Doug"

1026262,chris.brock,2018-04-12 14:14:00,4053,"I've never been but from what I've heard over the years, the fishing may be a little tough. I'm guessing to get some bigger walleyes it might be a good idea to troll crank baits after dark, that's what I would try."

1026284,akaShag,2018-04-12 18:55:00,2073,"I do not recall the names of any of the bays.  I had a rental boat from the lodge and did not venture more than maybe eight kilometres from the dock, and mostly less than that.  It was the first week of August.  Doug"

(private messages) SOMEWHERE you can set your board preferences, and ask for an e-mail notification for private messages.  If you get that e-mail, you can then just click on the highlighted text, which will take you to the most recently received private message.
