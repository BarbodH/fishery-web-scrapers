1025499,fish_nut,2018-03-31 09:26:00,3,Great job. Those Kawartha walleye do respond well to the bucktail!!
1025557,Stoty,2018-04-02 01:16:00,2910,Thanks very much! Can’t wait to feel that thump!
1025566,msp,2018-04-02 13:41:00,1336,Nice. Cant wait for the thump as well !
1025705,PUMP KNOWS,2018-04-05 01:00:00,937,Nice!  I wish I had those skills.
1025806,Stoty,2018-04-06 13:03:00,2910,"lol, thanks. Just picked up a bunch more Perfect Jig heads to tie a bunch more, from Gagnon's Yard Sale! Can't wait for walleye season!!"
1025880,camillj,2018-04-07 20:30:00,1988,I'll take ten green and ten yelllow !!!! Name your price !
1025884,misfish,2018-04-07 21:14:00,29133,"You seem to have the walleye covered. NIce. I was looking at jig heads today for some ties. Opt out to get supplies for nymphs and caddies. I wanted to tie some mouse fly's as well,but Cabelas sucks here for supplies. Not a single rabbit fur bag on the racks. Guess I,ll make the drive down to to sails in woodyville in the morning."
1025889,Tom S,2018-04-07 22:12:00,362,"What pattern are you tying? Mouse makes me think deer hair, not rabbit fur. Unless you are using rabbit strips for tails.  Why not save yourself the gas and order from Flymart? Support an Ontario business, get the exact material and colour you want, not compromise on what Cabelas or Sail has in stock."
1025896,misfish,2018-04-07 23:32:00,29133,Master splinter   Or the Morrish  Will look into flymart. Thanks Tom
1026022,Stoty,2018-04-09 11:54:00,2910,PM sent.
1025307,Stoty,2018-03-28 15:42:00,2910,"As any parent of young children knows... finding the time to get out on the water can be challenging. Since I need to release my ""cabin fever"" somehow, I decided that I was going to start making my own custom (walleye) bucktail jigs. Just thought I would share some of the ones I've done recently. A couple of my buddies told me that I should start selling them, but as of right now it's just for my own use and enjoyment. If there's demand... I might considering selling them.         "
1025312,limeyangler,2018-03-28 16:33:00,5204,"Wow those are cool, you have a talent! Oh, and is it just me or have you been quiet on here for a while, nice see see you again btw."
1025313,Stoty,2018-03-28 16:36:00,2910,Thanks Limey! I find it very relaxing and can’t wait to use them now. Lol
1025319,AKRISONER,2018-03-28 17:50:00,5558,seems like you are cut out for fly fishing lol  
1025321,Stoty,2018-03-28 18:35:00,2910,"Haha, I've literally never even touched a fly rod. The Kawartha Walter's love their bucktails!"
1025323,Sterling,2018-03-28 19:29:00,477,Very rewarding catching fish on tackle you made yourself. I'm working on some worm harnesses of my own now. Only time I ever caught anything on my own tackle was an awful painted spoon. Trout naturally ate it anyway.
1025327,Sinker,2018-03-28 19:44:00,8692,"Nice. What weight are they? I like the bullet heads myself, they seem to rip thru the weeds cleaner and easier.  S."
1025330,Stoty,2018-03-28 20:23:00,2910,Haha Stirling! Custom worm harnesses are cool! Haven’t done those before. I pour my own dropshot weights and used to build my own rods as well but haven’t done that in a few years. Cant wait to feel the “thump” of a walter on these jigs though!  sinker - they’re 1/4 and 3/8 oz. The metallic heads are Northland Tackle and the orange heads are The Perfct Jig.
1025335,LeXXington,2018-03-28 21:04:00,1928,Wow nice work!!!
1025336,misfish,2018-03-28 21:10:00,29133,"It,s fun  "
1025340,grimsbylander,2018-03-28 21:15:00,3016,Nice work Stoty and good to see you around. Hopefully see some wally pics soon too.
1025346,Tom S,2018-03-28 21:53:00,362,"Come to the dark side... we have scotch. But seriously, looks good. Hint with the bucktail - I had a a dyed tail that was a PITA to work with - wouldn't stack nicely, wouldn't tie in nicely. Upon someone else's recommendation I gave it a wash in warm water and a couple drops of Dawn. Make sure to dry it out completely. It's now a really nice tail to work with."
1025349,misfish,2018-03-28 22:18:00,29133,Jamie  Try using UV clear finish on the thread work. I have found it makes a nice finish and will help the longevity of the wrap.
1025353,bigugli,2018-03-28 23:48:00,6138,Nice looking jigs
1025354,Stoty,2018-03-28 23:57:00,2910,Thanks for the tips guys! I’ll def try them out! Misfish - I bought some thread hardener from a local tackle store that I’ve put on them all (3 coats of it). Most of the pictures were taken before I had done that.
1025361,Rizzo,2018-03-29 02:22:00,4754,right on those look great. Now make em ten times bigger and add a safety pin spinner you got a $35 musky bait
1025364,Stoty,2018-03-29 03:03:00,2910,Hmmmm......lol
1025365,Carp,2018-03-29 04:13:00,1488,Very nice work. 
1025368,Stoty,2018-03-29 10:09:00,2910,Thanks Carp
1025372,Stoty,2018-03-29 12:09:00,2910,Few more I tied up last night 
1025380,mamona,2018-03-29 13:45:00,597,I love those redheads. The heaviest you make are 3/8oz? What is the length? I would use them for pike
1025389,Stoty,2018-03-29 16:02:00,2910,I can make them in any weight and in any head. I’ve just done 1/4 & 3/8 oz cause that’s what I use for Walleye.
1025395,TJQ,2018-03-29 16:47:00,7806,Thats some nice looking stuff right there!!!
1025408,Stoty,2018-03-29 18:07:00,2910,Thanks TJ! Much appreciated.
1025412,AKRISONER,2018-03-29 18:17:00,5558,wanna tie me some streamers lol
