Tessa spoke to the insurance officer and said, “We had that garage insured for sixty thousand, and I want my money.” The officer answered, “Hold on there, just a minute. Insurance doesn’t work quite like that. An independent adjuster will assess the value of what was insured, and then we’ll provide you with a new garage of similar worth.” There was a long quiet pause, and then Tessa answered, “If that’s how insurance works, then I want to cancel the life insurance certificate on my husband.”"

Little Johnny's next door neighbours had a newborn baby that was born without ears. The neighbor's invited Johnny's family over for dinner and to meet the new baby. Prior to leaving the house Johnny's father pulled Johnny aside and warned him that if he even so mentioned anything about the baby's missing ears that he would get the lickin of a life time. Johnny obliged Upon arriving at the house everyone gathered around to admire the new baby. Johnny piped up and stated ""wow what a beatiful little baby, how much did he weigh?"" The mother replied ""a perfectly healthy 6lbs 14oz"" Johnny said, ""perfect...and look at his cute little feet, hes so cute isnt he?"" The mother once again replied ""yes hes our cute little ball of love"" Johnny then inquired ""he has such beautiful blue eyes, is his vision expected to be ok?"" The mother replied, ""the doctor thinks he will have 20-20 vision"" Johnny blurted ""well that's excellent news because if he needed glasses hed be f-ked"""
