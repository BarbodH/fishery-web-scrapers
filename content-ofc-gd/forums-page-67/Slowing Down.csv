1025925,stasbrute,2018-04-08 15:14:00,206,",Hello People, I am looking for tips on slowing down my boat for trolling, without resorting to a kicker motor.  I recently replaced my boat, and the new one has a 90 Honda, on idle I can't get much below 2 mph. I was thinking of two drift socks off the back, If anyone on this board have any suggestions I would love to hear them.  Thank you Greg"
1025927,lew,2018-04-08 15:35:00,12766,Back when I had a 90 HP Merc I used a Happy Troller and it worked great for very very slow trolling. https://www.davisnet.com/product/happy-troller-large/
1025928,Pigeontroller,2018-04-08 15:36:00,2793,Drag a pail.
1025929,BillM,2018-04-08 15:36:00,17367,Pail or a few IKEA bags out the back.
1025934,RickOnt,2018-04-08 15:46:00,669,"Drift sock, pail, trolling plate  They will all work Just which one you want to deal with"
1025935,BillM,2018-04-08 15:48:00,17367,"Silly question Greg, I'm assuming you need to get down slower for walleye?   Cause 2mph is about the absolute minimum out in Lake O even in the early spring.   Those browns/lakers will chase down anything."
1025936,Sinker,2018-04-08 15:53:00,8692,"I drop my bowount in and run it backwards against my main engine if I have to, or just use the bowmount.  S."
1025945,porkpie,2018-04-08 17:20:00,2521,"If you use trolling bags hang them off the bow cleats on either side.  I inherited 2 of them with my new boat last year and found them a pain when trolling.  But they just got in the way at the back of the boat. Long story short I now have a kicker, but definately hang them off the front if you use em!  I gave up and just used my bowmount to troll pickerel speed last season on smaller waterbodies, but that doesn't work so well on Erie when the wind is up."
1025946,kickingfrog,2018-04-08 17:43:00,8333,Yes I like mine on the bow as well. I'll use one or 2 depending on the time of year and the speed I'm looking for.
1025948,moxie,2018-04-08 18:47:00,1566,I use a trolling plate and to help with steering I've added a notch between full up and full down position. For added maneuverability you can also drill holes on the face of the plate.
1025949,stasbrute,2018-04-08 18:56:00,206,"Good tips guys. thanks. i never thought about dragging the bags from the bow cleats, i already have the drift socks, so I will try this out.  ."
1025959,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-08 20:55:00,8243,"I prefer a trolling plate over drift socks. I found drift socks were harder to control in choppy waters. The best solution is a small kicker, good to have back up power too just in case. I bought a kicker even though the 115 trolled just fine."
1025970,captpierre,2018-04-08 22:53:00,2521,I use a Minn Kota drift sock on the bow cleat on one side with a short rope extension. But not too long or it will get to the prop. Steering is challenging as the boat pulls to one side.  Just a tip. I’ve wrecked several drift socks by taking off without pulling them in. By the time you notice they’ve ripped apart. ?
