I recently sent an Rv9 in for warranty and Raven needs to send a new rod so I now have the option to pay the difference and upgrade to the RPX. The Rv9 was a pretty good off the shelf rod IMO but looking for something better. Wondering if the RPX is worth it and that much lighter and more powerful. Or maybe I get the new Rv9 back, sell it and go for the custom I always wanted. Decisions!!!"

Also I didn't know upgrading was a option."
