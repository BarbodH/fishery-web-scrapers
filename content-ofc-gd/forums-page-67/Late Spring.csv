1026327,JoshS,2018-04-13 14:35:00,729,I fish lake O so don't have that issue lol And some central ON lake. Gbay you may get some fresh ice out big fish still super shallow. Hopefully post spawn and ravenous!
1026328,BillM,2018-04-13 14:36:00,17367,"Yeah, those water temps dictate everything.   Gbay is always a good time on opener."
1026329,dave524,2018-04-13 14:41:00,4508,Late spring means more steelies in the rivers come opener  .
1026330,BillM,2018-04-13 14:43:00,17367,"That's unfortunate.  I like when it's a warm spring and all those fish are done and gone instead of  being ganked out of 4ft deep pools...    I'm not a huge spring steelhead guy anyhow, give me residents please."
1026348,misfish,2018-04-13 17:36:00,29133,"More time to get some flies tied which is whats  on the agenda this weekend. Going to be tying those 14-16 size hooks.  BUT That said, I cant wait for these open water beauts  "
1026353,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 19:13:00,8243,"There have been reports from out here they are getting fish, Walleye, Perch and even Pike. I was invited to go out a few times. I would love to get out there and get the cob webs off my stuff but no way I want to bad enough to dress like I'm going ice fishing, no way whatsoever. This weather is going to put me in a wheelchair I tell ya'. It takes me at least 3 hrs every morning to get me moving in an upright position, and no embellishment. It just sucks."
1026202,captpierre,2018-04-11 20:35:00,2521,Well below average temps after tomorrow for rest of April ???
1026203,lew,2018-04-11 20:38:00,12766,They're also talking about the chance of a big ice storm this weekend too.
1026205,TJQ,2018-04-11 20:41:00,7806,Im dieing... Maple Syrup hasnt really started and its mid april.. lolo.. I wont be done and to camp till june!!!  aghhggg!!!
1026206,AKRISONER,2018-04-11 20:45:00,5558,I dont think we are going to have ice out for opener this year...stuck not fishing the best walleye and pike fishing of the season.
1026212,OhioFisherman,2018-04-11 22:03:00,6623,"https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/44253 We seem to be having March weather here in April, except for the next couple of days I don't see much change."
1026214,akaShag,2018-04-11 23:11:00,2073,GLOBAL WARMING.
1026216,Joeytier,2018-04-12 00:31:00,3990,"Snowmobile trails are still awesome and lakes haven't lost an inch of ice yet, with 20 to 30 cm of fresh white stuff expected over the weekend.  I won't complain about an extended spring ice fishing season.  At this rate, I may be able to walk on water in the month of May."
1026222,BillM,2018-04-12 01:17:00,17367,I hope my end of May trip doesn't get canceled but it's not looking good so far!  Need some heat!
1026237,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-12 03:11:00,10439,"Yeah, it's cold here too!!!"
1026239,Freshtrax,2018-04-12 03:21:00,2215,At this point I'm getting nervous about nipigon first week of june
1026245,akaShag,2018-04-12 12:35:00,2073,But it's global WARMING...........
1026246,grimsbylander,2018-04-12 12:39:00,3016,I guess one cold spring totally debunks the global warming trends of 25 years.
1026247,HTHM,2018-04-12 12:40:00,4082,Look here for some more information: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/global-warming-arctic-colder-winters-climate-change-spd/
1026250,AKRISONER,2018-04-12 12:43:00,5558,lol its cold where I am right now so the world definitely isnt warmer https://climate.nasa.gov/  Science....  Those guys heading far north late may/early june for fishing trips...eeek Pointe Au Baril hasnt even started to thaw at all yet...if anythign its been making ice up until today basically...3 feet of solid black ice and its supposed to be cold all next week?
1026266,lew,2018-04-12 15:42:00,12766,Freezing fog over this way earlier today and now it's snowing. This silliness can end anytime it wants LOL
1026273,grimsbylander,2018-04-12 17:36:00,3016,I just know it'll go from snow to +20 in one day and it'll be summer.
1026279,AKRISONER,2018-04-12 18:34:00,5558,"There is one bright side to all of this. If pickerel and pike season and then bass season are all closed for x period...and then the natural cycle is pushed way back because there is still friggin ice on the lakes...we are in for a ripper of a spring fishing season. We are pushing 3 weeks to a month behind. Unless it gets really really hot really really fast, we are going to be fishing fish that have barely spawned yet/will be insanely ravenous post spawn. This is especially true with the Bass opener being at its absolute maximum earliest point in the month. Last year the day before bass opener we were seeing bass still up on the beds, but the day got really hot and by the next day they had all but vanished. Im thinking much of the same this year...time will tell.  The Browns are basically just starting up on the south end of lake Ontario and its almost May!"
1026282,akaShag,2018-04-12 18:45:00,2073,"Heck, yes!  But if you believe that stuff, you probably also believe that the world is ROUND, and that the moon landings REALLY happened!  	As Sir John A MacDonald wrote:  ""It is a grate pitye that the Internette hath caused so maney citizenes to believe in straynge tayles."""
1026291,AKRISONER,2018-04-12 20:35:00,5558,are you a flat earther...if so....awesome   
1026299,Sterling,2018-04-13 00:49:00,477,Super nervous about my trip up in James Bay in early June.....
1026305,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 03:20:00,8243,"It's not that Spring is late, it's Winter that refuses to leave. We celebrated a friends Birth Day 6 years ago to the day yesterday, backyard BBQ, shorts and T shirts. It snowed here yesterday."
1026309,lew,2018-04-13 11:48:00,12766,"I've got a link to the weathernetwork on my puter and now they're calling for 6-8"" od snow for this area. The fun just continues."
1026321,Tom S,2018-04-13 14:02:00,362,"Right. It snowed, and then warmed up to 15C in the afternoon. Just gave a glimpse of what we’re missing before back to cold this morning."
1026324,JoshS,2018-04-13 14:24:00,729,"I like a late spring. Some of my best springs have been late years. But it's probably because I concentrate on spring pike and a bit of bows until musky. Late spring is bonus for big pike after opener. We always crack 40"" more on late spring years. I like a late spring early on, then have it speed up mid may. On the other hand I don't like going to the river and seeing spawning bows all over the place after opener... and I do enjoy a good spring patio beer."
1026326,BillM,2018-04-13 14:31:00,17367,"I don't like a late spring, that usually means my spring pike spots are still covered with ice, lol.   Ah well, maybe I'll fish Muskoka on opener instead."
