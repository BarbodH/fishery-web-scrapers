Lake O now has a gale warning out with waves building up to 2 meters tomorrow. Plan B looks like launching somewhere out of the south end of the lake. I know that the launches down there close up for the winter. Can anyone guide me to an open launch somewhere between Burlington and Niagara Falls?  let me know what you guys have got! Thanks!"
1025474,Loonietoon,2018-03-30 18:44:00,1450,I believe Fish Farmer launched out of Grimsby a few weeks back... at a Forbes Marina I believe its called
1025476,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-30 18:47:00,8243,"Forans Marina maybe. Come out to Port Maitland, launch for free and catch a Walleye too."
1025478,porkpie,2018-03-30 18:51:00,2521,Port Dalhousie.  Forans is the marina in Grimsby.  I would take port Dalhousie launch over Forans any day.
1025479,BillM,2018-03-30 19:06:00,17367,"Dalhousie, Forans, etc etc.  Lots of them are open.   Bring your planner boards!"
1025483,leaf4,2018-03-30 19:45:00,2466,"I'm with OI, Usually when lake O is blown lake Erie is ideal, and vise versa, Maitland is a great spot for walleye too."
1025486,G.mech,2018-03-30 22:30:00,830,S-W 20 plus knot winds doesn't sound like a good day for Port Maitland.....
1025502,BillM,2018-03-31 14:00:00,17367,"Southern shore of Lake O will fish, problem is that wind is going to push any warm water out.  Fish will scatter.   I'm going to give it a few more weeks before I pull the boat down there for some fun. After looking at the wind forecast today, I don't think I'd be out in a boat anywhere."
1025510,Old Ironmaker,2018-03-31 16:14:00,8243,Not a good day out here today. SW winds 2 to 4 footers.
1025527,spincast,2018-04-01 13:12:00,3279,not a day for either shore - withthat wind 
1025538,Fish Farmer,2018-04-01 16:39:00,2234,"50 Pt. is open as of yesterday but launch fee is $24.00. Launch at Forans 2 weeks ago was free, not sure now. Sign there says $15.00. Was out there yesterday from 9 am. to 4 pm. Nada. Stayed in close fishing the shore 10 to 15 FOW. Water was to murky and very windy from the south. I trolled from 50 to just passed Grimsby and almost back, had enough."
1025565,AKRISONER,2018-04-02 13:12:00,5558," If that was you that launched out of Forans on Saturday morning then that was me in the bass boat ripping around there... The wind was absolutely nuts ripping from the south. I went out maybe 500 yards off shore to test the boat out and there was already a 3 foot chop rolling. Was great for testing out the new boat in though!. A warning to anyone launching out of Forans, a sand bar has formed at the entrance to the marina, water wasnt much more than a foot deep. I ended up bumping the sand with my outboard in a bass boat. If you have a big draft you could end up stuck on the hump there."
1025573,FishFinder17,2018-04-02 17:49:00,139,"Hey AKRI, Where abouts do you usually launch to fish humber bay? I recently moved to a condo at lake shore/park lawn area and am looking to get my boat out there in the next couple weeks. I've had success fishing lakers and browns in the stretch between Grimsby and St Catherines but hoping I can stay closer to home and find them near the mouth of humber/credit/bronte. Feel free to PM me if easier. Thanks, FF17"
1025612,Fish Farmer,2018-04-03 12:27:00,2234,I launched at 50 as they opened the launch early this year was great because I have a pass there. Like you say it was very windy so I stayed in close.
