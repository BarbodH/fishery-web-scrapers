My ropes pooched but ive never really messed around with paracord. i figure i could switch it out each year if it starts to wear down?  Im considering making my own G force handle at some point using a lawn mower replacement handle and Dog tie coated cable. Lil DYI project.,"
1026320,Sinker,2018-04-13 13:52:00,8692,Go to a small engines shop and get a replacement pull cord for a lawn mower. Para cord will only let you down in a short time.  S.

1026344,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 16:26:00,8243,Replacing the broken cord on my Motor Guide was fairly simple really. I think if I remember I used a stiff piece of wire leader  as a fish line with the cord tapped to it. I always keep some cordage and a roll of electrical and duct tape on the boat. It took all of 10 minutes. I always intended to change it to a better quality cord but it is still there. Now I have another to do when it stops snowing.
1026346,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-13 17:21:00,10439,They have pull cord @ Canadian Tire.
1026355,Lape0019,2018-04-13 19:28:00,647,$13.00 for the same handle on amazon and a couple of feet of aircraft cable and you are good to go!
1026357,AKRISONER,2018-04-13 19:40:00,5558,"i found the right handle, they make them for lawn mowers and now all of a sudden i cant find it!"
1026407,OhioFisherman,2018-04-14 03:29:00,6623,"I used parachute cord from Walmart to hold down the tarps on my wood piles, that stuff seemed to deteriorate quickly when exposed to sun  and weather. I replaced one once and use braided nylon similar to light anchor rope."

1026615,AKRISONER,2018-04-15 23:56:00,5558,"I know they do, and they want $50 for an 8 dollar handle and $4 worth of coated cable...i think this should make for a nice DIY project when I have a moment. Thanks for finding me it again lape!"
1026619,akaShag,2018-04-16 00:00:00,2073,"as others have said, paracord is not a good idea except in an emergency.  The ""REAL THING"" has 550 pound breaking strength, but the sheath around the nylon fibres is apt to separate. I think this is one of those areas where the OEM part is a good idea......... Doug"
