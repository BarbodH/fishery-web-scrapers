1026083,Alumacraft,2018-04-10 02:17:00,139,Found out today that my oldest son is springing for Penguins game 2 playoff tickets.?. Awesome kid. We're planning on driving up Friday and staying overnight. Just wondering if there are any tackle shops worth stopping at in Pittsburgh or on the way down. We'll be crossing the border in Buffalo and traveling on the I-90W and I-79S into Pittsburgh. Thanks in advance Rob.

Not much out of your way, maybe 20 minutes from the Peace Bridge. Great selection and they may have sales on. Do the math before you pull out your Visa Card. Some items may be the same price or actually more than here."
1026086,GBW,2018-04-10 02:46:00,8460,Dick's Sporting goods is an option if close.  However I have see a LOT of WalMart finds in the US on a facebook page for bass fishing on some crazy deals.  So don't over look the big box stores too.
1026087,Fang,2018-04-10 03:00:00,1330,"Field and stream in Erie , mill creek mall. In same complex there is a dicks sporting goods. Only 10 mins from I90 I did some damage on hunting and fishing clothing there. Just passed Erie is a fishusa warehouse and I had heard a while back you could order and possibly pick up if you made it there during open hours"
1026089,OhioFisherman,2018-04-10 03:07:00,6623,As I recall Field and Stream stores are owned by Dick's stores.
1026118,misfish,2018-04-10 15:52:00,29133,Can you stop into a walmart and buy me a pontoon ? They dont carry them up here. LOL  Thats a nice thought by yer boy. Enjoy the game and time.
1026120,Lape0019,2018-04-10 16:07:00,647,Is this location up and running again? Gander Mountain went bankrupt last year and a new owner bought them out of bankruptcy. The new stores will be named Gander Outdoors but only a handful of the locations are currently open from what I have read.
1026125,OhioFisherman,2018-04-10 17:25:00,6623,https://www.ganderoutdoors.com/store-locator/list/ They are showing a Tonawanda location.
1026127,Garnet,2018-04-10 17:32:00,2056,I thought all the Gander mountains closed. Not for this trip but a resonantly went to  Angler Sports in London Ont. should be a must stop. And Angler Outfitters in Woodstock is another one.
1026211,Alumacraft,2018-04-11 21:48:00,139,Thanks for the replies I'll be sure to check out a few of these shops.
1026252,Lape0019,2018-04-12 12:47:00,647,"Yes, it shows the location but states opening in July."
1026255,OhioFisherman,2018-04-12 12:59:00,6623,"LOL, MS must be effecting my brain now! How did I miss that?"
