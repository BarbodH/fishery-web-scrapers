1026447,kickingfrog,2018-04-14 17:54:00,8333,Looking for recommendations for service for a 50hp Johnson outboard in the Barrie area.Â I think I've asked before but with all the changes I can't seem to find the info I'm looking for.
1026449,misfish,2018-04-14 18:02:00,29133,You can try Brentwood marine Rob.
1026460,Cosmos,2018-04-14 19:41:00,588,I would like to recommend Leatherdale in Orillia. Its longer drive but outstanding service.
1026531,Rizzo,2018-04-15 12:18:00,4754,Nothing wrong I hope Rob?
1026532,Rizzo,2018-04-15 12:20:00,4754,"Marsh's marine I think its called in Port Severn sells Suzuki, and if I remember correctly that Johnson you have was made by Suzuki. Maybe they would be an option"
1026533,porkpie,2018-04-15 12:29:00,2521,How far are you willing to drive?
1026638,kickingfrog,2018-04-16 01:16:00,8333,"Nope, but I feel that after 5 seasons of flawless use it's due for more tlc than I'm capable of."
