1025568,muskymatt,2018-04-02 14:19:00,2608,Yup. I don't think it would have been cleaned up had he not been caught and called out.
1025570,grimsbylander,2018-04-02 15:17:00,3016,"Imagine smacking one of those propane tanks with your boat?? wow I'm glad this came out and was brought to everyone's attention. This is how we protect our resources and defend against the people who simply want to exploit them for personal gain. As destructive as the internet can be, 30 years ago this would have never received the public awareness level it has and would have most likely repeated next year. Making sure that people breaking the law are forced into the public spotlight is far more damaging than quietly shuffling off to court and receiving Ontario's customary slap on the wrist fine. The fine's are simply the fuel which ignite the desire to make more money, cut more corners, cheat the system. The only way fine's work is if they are substantial enough to force the owner out of the ""resources for money"" business because obviously, they cannot be trusted."
1025571,muskymatt,2018-04-02 15:26:00,2608,And then there is the simple fact that some people are just pigs who think they have no rules and can do whatever they please whenever they please.

1025585,chris.brock,2018-04-02 21:18:00,4053,"Exactly. The cool thing is no COs or cops were involved, just an average Joe fisherman posted it and it has since been (allegedly) cleaned up and the outfitter likely won't do it again.   "
1025587,wkrp,2018-04-02 22:45:00,656,I cant help from wondering what went down the holes of this operation during the season.

1025592,chris.brock,2018-04-02 23:32:00,4053," He probably is an a hole, but if he has the slightest clue about running a business, he likely won't do it again"

1025519,grimsbylander,2018-04-01 04:05:00,3016,I hope they find the person(s) responsible and make sure they never fish again. This really ticks me off. https://www.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1360450&playlistId=1.3866423&binId=1.810401&playlistPageNum=1&binPageNum=1
1025520,John Bacon,2018-04-01 04:41:00,3277,I saw a post about this on Facebook earlier today.  The poster seemed to know which commercial hut operator left the garbage but didn't mention their name. 
1025523,Terry,2018-04-01 12:16:00,14456,The owner of KS Fish Huts has posted an apology on facebook saying he was unaware of it
1025524,Rizzo,2018-04-01 12:28:00,4754,yipes. I would imagine (or hope) that this is the handiwork of lazy hired help rather than an owner
1025525,lew,2018-04-01 12:34:00,12766,"It's so sad that we have to share this planet with slobs like this and when whoever left that mess is caught I hope they nail him and all others like him with the harshest punishment available. I live on a beautiful country road near Burleigh Falls that runs off hwy 28 and along Clear Lake and it's unbelievable how much garbage people throw here.  They come in off the hwy after dark when nobodies around and dump all the garbage they're too lazy or cheap to take to the local landfill / recycling site. Just off the top of my head I recall piles of aluminum siding, tires, a surfboard, construction materials, bicycles, mattresses, regular garbage and all sorts of other crap. Last year someone ever discarded an 18' sailboat & trailer after they removed all identification. It was posted here the other day about someone being fined $11,000 for keeping too many fish, maybe if those kinda fines were issued for tossing garbage everywhere it may cut back on some of it."
1025526,Fisherman,2018-04-01 13:05:00,7201,"Agree Lew, judges are far too lenient when it comes to getting people to straighten out their lives.  Owner issues apology, wth, owner should be issuing a pink slip to the employee(s) and then kicking himself in the azz for failing to check that the final outcome was right."
1025529,muskymatt,2018-04-01 14:05:00,2608,Wow.....some people have no shame. Sad!
1025530,woodenboater,2018-04-01 14:13:00,2277,"good to see this has already been posted. if it was this operator, they shld lose their biz license to operate huts. wonder what else they left on the bottom of simcoe over the years."
1025531,woodenboater,2018-04-01 14:15:00,2277,that's very generous and possible but an owner not realizing he's missing a ton of lp tanks ? not buying. they should have gone back if they noticed the count was off.
1025532,John Bacon,2018-04-01 15:23:00,3277,"Here is the owner's response.  	Even if he is telling the truth, I don't consider a propane tank to be an appropriate marker.  Hopefully he was honest about it being taken care of... "
1025533,OhioFisherman,2018-04-01 15:34:00,6623,"Dang Lew, much more scenic than my country road! Mine has drainage ditches on both side, they seem to be a collection area for fast food trash, soda and beer containers."

1025544,DanD,2018-04-01 17:50:00,2223,"You're 100% right there! Try running a small business in a city; where you need a dumpster for the business's waist. Especially for an automotive shop. People think I'm a dumping ground for all their waste oils and anti freezes. If I lock the dumpsters lids, they throw the garbage bags on the ground next to the dumpster. The waist oils and anti freezes, are left in old 1 gallon containers or open 5 gallon pails. Not a word of a lie, I get close to 20 gallons of waste oil and anti freeze, every month. The waste oil costs me a varying amount of 25 - 40 cents a liter, to have it disposed of properly. The garbage at the dumpster is a mix of building materials and household garbage. When I'm in a crappy mood, I'll rip the garbage bags open. The idiots usually will leave something in there with their address. I've tried calling the cops; but they're not interested. So when I do find an address, I deliver it back to their doorstep and empty the bags on. The look on their faces and the stumbling voices, is well worth the gross digging through the bags. Sorry end of rant. Dan."
1025545,bigugli,2018-04-01 17:58:00,6138,"We se the dumping right at the rear driveway to the farm. Caught the one fellow and chased him back to his house. Police response "" We have to catch him in the act""."

1025554,Rattletrap2,2018-04-01 23:50:00,1652,Apologies are not enough!!! Let's see some proof that this Hut Operator took care of business and had this mess cleaned up! Absolutely disgusting! No way in hell this operator should be allowed to put huts out any time in the next few years. The mess should be cleaned up and he/they should pay the bill.
1025559,HTHM,2018-04-02 02:43:00,4082,"His Facebook is still up, and he has indicated that the mess has been cleaned up.  Now, if only they would clean up the bridge that was dumped into Port Bruce...."
1025561,Fish Farmer,2018-04-02 12:09:00,2234,"Tell me, the guys removing the huts couldn't put the trash in the hut while removing them. Thats Bull. Not to bright if you ask me."
1025563,AKRISONER,2018-04-02 13:05:00,5558,"I call total Bull on the ""oh i wasnt aware"" you do realize that when you are the CEO of a large corporation, when your company breaks the law you are legally responsible for your business...as such the owner deserves to be charged. The ""i didnt know"" excuse doesnt matter...did you commit the crime of leaving garbage on the ice? Yes...therefore you should be charged."
1025564,Terry,2018-04-02 13:10:00,14456,"from his facebook page;= Hello everyone, just an update that all of the garbage and propane tanks have been cleaned up and removed from the ice earlier today. I would once again like to apologize. This should not have happened. I would also like to clarify that I am not putting any blame on my employees. When I said I take full responsibility, I meant it. It is my responsibility to make sure everything that needs to be done is done properly. ICE CONDITION: As per Tom Carr's post stating that there is 25 inches of ice around the area where our huts were....this is NOT the case. This area of the ice is inconstant and UNSAFE for people to be roaming around on. For the other experienced operators who have claimed they are heading out there tomorrow, I highly suggest avoiding the area, or please tread very carefully. Tom Carr has told me personally that he will be posting pictures of the cleaned up area tomorrow."
