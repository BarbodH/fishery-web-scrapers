1025767,Headhunter,2018-04-05 18:22:00,5703,Each financial institution has it's own limits on e-transfer amounts. Cash is king and the cop shop is a good idea. I understand that they have designated a number of divisions to accommodate cash sales. Good luck with the sale. HH
1025771,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-05 18:47:00,8243,"I had 2 weapons back then on me at all times, even sleeping. They were left and right guns, get it, guns. Junkies were no more or less visible back then too, they were smarter though. Those were the days in Steel City that differences were settled in the parking lots at the plants or hotels, no guns or knives etc. The odd ball bat could come into play however, actually a nice piece of washing machine hose with a ski pole grip was more effective and much lighter. I had an old Compare that when asked by the Police why he had a baseball bat in the back seat, he told him in his broken English ""Just in case I see a game and I want to play too, you never know."" Then they asked ""What about the shotgun, in case you see a Deer playing on Burlington St?"""
1025773,G.mech,2018-04-05 18:59:00,830,Call your bank and see what they say the best and most secure method is.
1025777,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-05 20:19:00,8243,"Sounds similar to this Bitcoin thing. It is something my dear Lady is looking into, I don't like the idea. Actually I don't like any idea that can't be explained to me and my simple noggin within a few days, especially when it comes to MY money, her money too."
1025778,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-05 20:31:00,273,"Not really.  Bitcoin is a currency, like USD and Yen and Euro.  It is just not recoginized by most governments and thus isn't controlled and regulated like a countries currency. PayPal works just like online banking with our own 'legit' currency.  The problem is if something goes wrong with a transaction you can't just pickup the phone and call someone.  That is part of the risk with PayPal.  I'm a PayPal user and have a 'verified' account (means it is linked to my banking savings account ... so I can make a payment either from my credit card or my savings account).  And in reverse ... when I take money out of my PayPal account it goes to my savings account at my bank.    Other than the one time I had a problem and could not transfer money out of my PayPal account, it has been quite handy.  But when I had that one problem ... I just couldn't pickup the phone and call someone and get an answer.  I had to read lots of FAQ and HELP pages and read other peoples same problem before I finally found what I had to do (I had to 'reset' my account). If I had thousands sitting in my PayPal account and could not transfer the money out and had no one to contact for help ... I'd be very upset.  From my experience ... I only use it for online shopping.  I have received small $ transfers to me ... but I keep them rare and small because of the problem I once had."
1025781,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-05 21:22:00,8243,"So as a Bitcoin or e commerce user I can wake up the next morning and find it has devaluated to zippo? That's all I need to know about e commerce. I have a total of 1 experience buying on line, I needed a flight to Arizona the same day. I'm old school, if I use a bank or credit card and the purchase is say 200 bucks I have 220 cash in my pocket. Believe it or not where we live there isn't a cable connection from retail stores, only dial up so using a bank card etc. is hit and miss."
1025782,Garnet,2018-04-05 22:10:00,2056,You go into a bank these days with more than 10k and you are answering questions signing document and generally the 3rd degree. All money laundering.
1025794,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-06 01:55:00,8243,"All you need is a copy of the sales receipt, that will keep you clear of a money laundering charge. I sold a 76' Vette in 79' for 7800 bucks, the guy gave me a big old well worn paper bag full of 5's, 10's and 20's, no questions asked back then, a few raised eyebrows raised for sure though. Definitely the guy was washing his dope money. Someone set it on fire a week later according to the Cops that paid me a visit. I need to write that book. edit: before I forget what really happened, what is embellished or what I think really happened."
1025802,Garnet,2018-04-06 11:12:00,2056,I took a large amount of money out to buy a boat. I wanted cash to negotiate and it was a distance away. The bank was adamant the government would be this and that. My simple statement I'm not doing anything wrong just buying a boat. I did put money back in bank in smaller amounts to avoid signing documents.
1025816,mikeh,2018-04-06 19:33:00,824,I agree asking your bank is the best bet. What kind of boat are you selling?
1025832,aplumma,2018-04-06 22:46:00,6896,"You might want to remind the person that if you want over $ 8,000.00 cash that it has to be prearranged for the bank to have the money on hand for them to pick up.  I needed 19,000 for a piece of equipment and they had to have it delivered but asked next time to give them a weeks warning the next time. Art"
1025844,Dutch01,2018-04-07 05:19:00,1431,It's just a regular fishing boat (under $10K). It all kayak fishing for me from here on. I think if possible I will meet them at their bank to get a certified cheque and settle the sale. Any ideas on a good deposit to ask for on $6-7K sale? $500? 
1025846,DanD,2018-04-07 10:10:00,2223,Sorry but if that's all you're talking about (7K) then there's no question.   CASH!!!!!      Shake the guy's hand and walk away. Not to brag but I make weekly business deposits of that plus amount. Take the cash and don't flount it. Dan. 
1025851,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 11:34:00,8243,"7 grand, we collect far more than that in cash at our annual Golf Tourney. You can tell today is a cashless society. Don't sweat it Dutch, cash is King."
1025855,OhioFisherman,2018-04-07 14:13:00,6623,"I just viewed a deposit as a definite show of interest, most people won't just give you a couple hundred bucks on a sale like that and walk away or not show."
1025911,Dutch01,2018-04-08 05:13:00,1431,Just got home from a long day getting the boat out of storage and had a chance to catch up to all the replies. Cash is king sounds good to me. Thanks!
1025940,Garnet,2018-04-08 16:17:00,2056,I never take deposit unless they are substantial.
1025977,Dutch01,2018-04-08 23:19:00,1431,"Luckily it didn't come to that, I sold it this afternoon and they paid in cash!  "
1026014,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-09 04:47:00,8243,"Congrats dutch. Was it really a happy day? You know what they say about the 2 happiest days in a boat owners life. It will be a sad one for this guy I tell ya'. What are you going to do with all that $$ you save on owning a boat? Yaks are good for 2 things, fuel and health. Health as long you stay on it not under it. JAJ."
1026024,Dutch01,2018-04-09 12:00:00,1431,"Thanks, it was a bittersweet day of course. I had a lot of great times in that boat. But it was too costly to store (I live in an apartment) and I didn't use it enough to justify it. The money all went to debt so no happy windfall for me. Having said that, I expect to do a lot more fishing this year. My kayak is free to store and I can throw it in my truck and go whenever and wherever I want."
1026028,grimsbylander,2018-04-09 12:59:00,3016,"Sell a boat??? What's that?? I can see buying another boat, but sell one?? LOL Glad it worked out. Cash is good."
1026265,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-12 15:15:00,273,
1026335,BillM,2018-04-13 14:57:00,17367,"Perhaps.  Still never a way I'd purchase a boat.  Been burned with e-transfer before, lesson learned"
1026343,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 16:13:00,8243,"I get it now. The Knights Templar created the first banking system based on Gold, Silver and Jewels , Bitcoin is invisible. they didn't accept Bitcoin during the crusades. As far a Pay Pal, taking to a kid yesterday they were supposed to take $80.00 from his Pay Pal account and they took $800.80 from it. He has been trying to recover his money for 2 months. The seller has disappeared and there is no human to talk to at Pay Pal. I'll stick to going to the store to buy my stuff ."
1025711,Dutch01,2018-04-05 03:17:00,1431,"For those that have sold a boat privately, how do you like to transfer the funds? You hear so much about scams these days, not sure if I should ask for cash (that's a lot of cash to have on me at one time) or certified cheque (can someone counterfeit those???) Thanks!"
1025715,16 Footer,2018-04-05 10:01:00,191,A bank draft maybe safer. A certified cheque can be faked.
1025716,Garnet,2018-04-05 10:39:00,2056,if you are lucky and both party's deal at same bank you can just transfer money . Both go to branch in minutes it's done.
1025717,Dutch01,2018-04-05 10:40:00,1431,That's kinda what I'm worried about but not sure I could tell a fake bank draft from a real one either ? If I go cash I'd like to meet at the Police station where they have a place for safe exchange but still a little uneasy about carrying thousands in cash.....
1025718,Dutch01,2018-04-05 10:41:00,1431,That WOULD be lucky! my fings are crossed ?
1025719,Tom S,2018-04-05 10:50:00,362,If you bank online you should be able to do an e-transfer even between different banks. Secure and easy for both parties.
1025720,Garnet,2018-04-05 11:14:00,2056,A certified check only means the money is in account at that time. It doesn't put hold on funds the person can transfer funds else where any time. Certified check are useless .
1025724,Fisherman,2018-04-05 12:29:00,7201,Bring along a couple of guys from Woodbridge.
1025725,AKRISONER,2018-04-05 12:37:00,5558,bank draft is how I would do it... When i just purchased a boat the guy was keeping it for me for a week until I could come and pick it up. That way he knew he had the money and I knew exactly where he lived and his legal name. I guess nothing is perfect? Could you not agree to go to the bank with him to cash the cheque...heck tow the boat to the bank cash the cheque with him there. Then you both part ways into the sunset.
1025728,chris.brock,2018-04-05 12:59:00,4053,Definitely an option. An e-transfer isn't instantaneous though. I bought a snowmobile on a Sunday evening (banks closed) with an e-transfer. I had to wait in my car for over an hour until the email showed up in the seller's inbox.
1025729,BillM,2018-04-05 13:10:00,17367,Cash.
1025730,Lape0019,2018-04-05 13:14:00,647,"They can all be faked these days. I took a bank draft and had to wait for it to clear as the bank it was from was closed for the day. It came in the next day. Now, I sold my boat to a buddy so I was not too worried. If it would have been to someone I did not know, he would be coming to the bank with me and would not be hooking my boat up to his tow rig until I had confirmed the money was in my account."
1025731,grimsbylander,2018-04-05 13:18:00,3016,"If you're that concerned, meet the guy at his bank while he gets his bank draft. Then take him to the boat and do the deal."
1025732,Dutch01,2018-04-05 13:31:00,1431,"It seems like this should be more simple....I like the idea off going to the guys bank, but even banks can get fooled I guess. I like email transfer but what do you do if it doesn't come through right away like Chris said..... Looks like cash might still be safest, ironically. I though selling my boat would be hard but I've had a dozen offers already. Who knew ""money changing"" would be the hard part...."
1025734,John Bacon,2018-04-05 14:03:00,3277,The cheque could still bounce.  Going with him to his bank to get a bank draft is a good idea though.
1025736,OhioFisherman,2018-04-05 14:36:00,6623,"A different country, but I sold my boat, a tandem axle utility trailer, and a compact diesel tractor back in 2009 off of craig's list. I asked what I thought was a fair price for each, specified no haggling and cash only, they were all gone in 2 days. Now if you're selling a boat or something involving a lot of cash going together to the bank might be a better plan."
1025748,Canuck,2018-04-05 16:12:00,491,"This is the best route if you do a bank draft.  the bank can verify the draft for you. You can also have him to an interac eTransfer by email to you if you have on line banking.  Once it is in your account, there can be no scam and he can't pull it back."
1025749,BillM,2018-04-05 16:22:00,17367,E-transfer has a 2k limit.  And there's no way I'd ever use e-transfer as a buyer.   So easy to get scammed.
1025750,jimmer,2018-04-05 16:36:00,2730,Cash only in my books.  I don't care how much it is.
1025752,Tom S,2018-04-05 16:41:00,362,"Or exchange via PayPal, it has a $10K limit on unverified accounts and a formal dispute process if anyone tries something fishy."
1025753,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-05 16:41:00,8243,"I want to see cash but if not comfortable go to the guys bank with him and get a cashiers cheque from the teller. I once sold a house and went to my bank with a bag with $195,000.00 in it. It took me 1/2 an hour to count it. That I don't recommend to the faint of heart. I was young then and had 35 lbs more of muscle, but looking back I was an idiot."
1025759,AKRISONER,2018-04-05 17:31:00,5558,In the hammer in the 80's carrying around 200 racks without a weapon? you are a mad man. I bet those junkies could smell the fear leaking from your sweat glands lol
1025760,Dutch01,2018-04-05 17:34:00,1431,"Lmao! Having >$100K in cash to count is a ""problem"" I wouldn't complain about having right now!  So it sounds like cash exchange (at the  police station is my preference) or his bank and have them verify the draft."
1025763,John Bacon,2018-04-05 17:49:00,3277,That must be the daily limit on your account.  I have done a couple of email transfers for $3k each.
1025764,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-05 17:50:00,273,"Going through PayPal is a very bad idea. Just Google people having trouble with their PayPal accounts and not being able to withdraw money from their PayPal account and into their bank account due to an odd 'tech' problem and to learn just how ineffective their dispute service is.  This happened to me once.  I speak from experience. PayPal isn't a brick and mortar business you can walk into and help get a problem resolved, unlike your local bank."
