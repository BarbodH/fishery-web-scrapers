1026298,captpierre,2018-04-12 23:56:00,2521,Took a drive to the cottage today. Scugog causeway. No ice. South Pigeon. No ice.  Gannon Narrows. No ice. Bridgenorth causeway. Just a bit of wind blow ice. Rest clear.  North east Pigeon still iced up. Water levels rising but still 1 ft below summer levels.
1026311,Stoty,2018-04-13 12:20:00,2910,On behalf of everyone... thanks for the updates! I live across the street from Scugog and the Caesarea side of Scugog has been clear and open for almost 2 weeks. Guys have been out almost everyday the last week and a bit.
1026354,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-13 19:15:00,273,I live on Buckhorn Lake.  Just ask me and I'm happy to give an update.
1026359,GBW,2018-04-13 19:45:00,8460,I was just at 4 mile lake and it's still covered.  *sigh*
1026363,jimmer,2018-04-13 20:18:00,2730,"Man, that lake gets hit hard and early. At least someone is getting out on the open water."
1026368,Tjames09,2018-04-13 20:45:00,664,"I saw a boat in the scugog river last week..............Not sure what they were doing, river is sanctuary until mid May."
1026382,Stoty,2018-04-13 23:47:00,2910,It sure does Jimmer. I live across the street from it yet barely ever fish it cause launching a boat is such a pain once the bass season is open. Heck I’ve been down to the pier at night a few times wanting to take my little guys fishing and I can’t because it’s literally PACKED. And the garbage that’s left all over the place...is crazy. I usually always choose to drive a bit to get away from the crowds. Gas companies sure love us fishermen. LOL
