1026023,Sterling,2018-04-09 11:58:00,477,"Maybe we used a different technology or something, but there's no way I would be able to interpret SI 240ft out. Disclaimer: I don't have SI on my boat but my fishing partner does. Where it really shined was checking docks for fish (bass) which was in very close quarters. Then again it looks like you're using SI for locating structure while I'm using it to find fish."
1026027,grimsbylander,2018-04-09 12:55:00,3016,"Agreed. I don't target suspended fish so rarely ever use electronics to look for fish. I'm not sure how you use it for fishing docks either? Do you drive past all the docks first to decide which ones hold fish? I catch fish all the time that don't show up on my electronics and that's on a clean bottom...not sure how reliable it would be with weed growth under a dock?  I'd like to hear more about your process. As for the 240 ft per side....not my numbers. I have HDS units and get great data out to about 150 or so. That's a 300' swath and like previously mentioned, I can spot structure, zoom in, lay down a waypoint, and circle back on it. I also have a Point 1 antenna so I know exactly where I'm facing and how far out the waypoint is. This is extremely handy in water 15+ feet or more. This is my method for breaking down large targets areas such as points. Instead of fishing the ""point"", I'll do a 5-10mph fly-by and lay down a bunch of waypoints on any good looking structure that on the point. Then fish those waypoints only. Makes breaking down a point, saddle, hump, etc much quicker and I only fish the good structure on the structure."
1026029,Sterling,2018-04-09 13:17:00,477,"Not 100% sure of the details but at the bow of my partner's boat is a helix (I think). We swing around near a dock, say 25-30ft out and with the proper orientation SI scans under the dock. The dock pillars will show up strong and are easy to interpret. Using the dock pillars as reference you can easily see whether there are larger fish hanging around. Then it's just a matter of knowing where to cast. Where this was used (Temagami) weed growth isn't a big problem as the lake is very rocky. Every dock and structure gets a few casts regardless, as you mentioned fish can hide..."
1026030,AKRISONER,2018-04-09 13:44:00,5558,"im sure I am just repeating what everyone else said...I never cared much for si until I really thought about it and started using it.... Traditional sonar and down imaging allows you to see whats going on under your boat...the odd time, ya you may see a fish suspended, but what you are really trying to figure out is what the heck is going on down there....with si you drive down the lake and all of a sudden you can say wow, there is a weed edge 70 feet to the right of the boat...or hey there is a pile of rubble 80 feet to the left of the boat. I think to all of the times that I have been driving down the lake using 2d sonar and i notice some crazy feature or drop off and decide that its probably worth fishing that pile of boulders...and sure enough catch fish...imagine being able to scan 200 feet of the lake all at once. I also totally disagree with sterling...deep water is when Si really shines IMO. cruising along the lake in 30 fow you will see everything around you. I guess ""deep"" is a relative term, its not going to help you in 200 fow for salmon IMO its totally worth it.  Edit...dont overlook down imaging either...This fall I was driving along and notice a pile of what looked to be just garbage/weeds on the bottom in 20 fow, pretty much just a clump of whatever...Ya ok it may be fish? flip to d.i. sure enough there are 20 perfect siloutes of individual perch with a big hook below them, drop shot down...this guy comes up   Like most things, its all about how comfortable you get with them. A lot like baits...if you feel good about what you are doing it will work for you. If you are wary of the technology you probably wont use it. My dad has an si unit...he literally had the DI screens shut off because according to him ""they are useless"" lol"
1026034,Lape0019,2018-04-09 13:59:00,647,"Garnet, While I agree that SI on a TM will blur when you turn, it does have its advantages if you know what you are looking for. I have been in scenarios with my buddy where I was monitoring the unit at the console and he was monitoring the one at the bow with SI and we could determine the length of rock piles to narrow our drift. It all has a use, the cost is what determines how much you have to have it.  As for 360, my tournament partner had it for a while and sold it. He did not like the imaging on it unless you were stationary. He found that even small waves would disrupt the view and just got frustrated with it. He felt that if he was in shallow water and had a talon or something to hold his position, it would be better at getting what he was looking for with regards to clarity of the screen but, it was not worth it to him so he sold it."
1026037,Lape0019,2018-04-09 14:02:00,647,"Great post. When we were looking for those rock piles/boulders, we were in 40 FOW. It is most definitely not just for shallow water."
1026049,Garnet,2018-04-09 18:05:00,2056,All I'm pointing out is 360 and SI are not the same. I would never turn SI on if I had 360.
1026052,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-09 19:40:00,8243,"I am amazed at some of the fishing machines decked out. 2 guys came out to our little community fundraiser for a local volunteer Firefighters family that died in a kitchen fire in his own home. A Walleye tourney and won it. That Walleye boat had to be well over 100 Grand. If there was technology available on the biggest screens available they had it. I counted 4, plus the Talon anchors, power everything, a loaded 12 rod tower etc. etc. Not fair I say, just not fair. The grand prize was $500.00, and ask me if they donated any back to the Firefighters kids like the winner usually does? Are you kidding?  No one knew these guys, not a soul. I'm off topic of course sorry guys. It just irks me."

Once you see how that works ... you'll want to sell your kidney on the black market to buy one of these amazing units.  Attach it to the trolling motor and use it to scan not just down but in front of the boat ... in real-time instant feedback up to easily 100ft away ... pretty slick!  There are YouTube vid's demoing how these new units work. Myself, I have a DI Humminbird G2N unit on my bow and a SI Humminbird G2N unit at the console."
1026105,AKRISONER,2018-04-10 14:03:00,5558,"Panoptix is a total game changer...but is also $2,000 for a base model unit. Big difference between a Helix 5/7 si and a panoptix system. I literally think panoptix is even more valuable for ice fishing...its absolutely insane."
1026110,JoshS,2018-04-10 14:23:00,729,Get the si and learn how to use it and you will be happy you did. If you fish structure it's a valuable tool. Example: you can troll past a weedline and lay down waypoints along the entire edge marking all angulations accurately - then you have your spot well mapped to cast or troll next time. Much more effective mapping structure with side imaging opposed to regular sonar when you are on top of it.
1026112,G.mech,2018-04-10 14:29:00,830,"Bingo.  The biggest problem with all this stuff is that people buy it, install it, and never take the time to learn how to use it effectively for their application."
1026130,Garnet,2018-04-10 17:43:00,2056,I was at a seminar maybe 15 years ago and 1 of the guys started with his first slide saying. This is the most important thing about SI and he flipped the switch to a picture of the power button.

1025939,Garnet,2018-04-08 16:14:00,2056,What kind of fishing are you doing. If lake trolling not that important. It's important to know that you either side image or fish. Trying to do both a cluster .....! 
1025944,porkpie,2018-04-08 17:16:00,2521,"I like having the option.  I troll a lot, but a lot of it is in water 30 foot and under so I sit in the drivers chair and mark rocks and other underwater features as they come up.  Then I can turn around on them and make a pass.  When I'm on the Great Lakes I don't use it at all but I've heard some guys use it to find bait balls. I may try it sometime.  It's sure not mandatory, but worth the few extra bucks if your upgrading anyway in my opinion."
1025947,Sterling,2018-04-08 17:54:00,477,"Incredibly useful when going after bass around docks, for example. Useless when fishing deep water."
1025964,Musky Plug,2018-04-08 21:42:00,398,"I think it’s worth the extra money, it can be useful for trolling in my experience. I use side imaging in addition to the other views on the graph. I use it to mark structure and bait when trolling for musky. It only reads until about 20’ or so."

1025984,OhioFisherman,2018-04-09 00:27:00,6623,"I watched the 2018 BassMaster Classic, props to Jordan Lee for the back to back wins. There was some discussion  from the commentators during the event on the number young guys in the field and their ability to grasp the technology that they have grown up with. The ability to see 240 feet or so off to either side gives you a huge advantage if you are able to decipher what you are seeing. These kids are fishing in high school clubs and college clubs, they are learning the technology early. You're in 30 feet of water and seeing a 10 foot circle, that guy that can see 240 feet off to either side has an advantage, how many fish do you miss, or how much more time do you have to spend locating them?  "
1025998,chris.brock,2018-04-09 01:13:00,4053,"I agree the younger generation is better with the tech stuff. I still don't think having SI is a totally clear picture of everything going on 240' to either side of the boat, even for the young guys. It doesn't really work like that. In the ads they have for SI they show images of standing trees and sunken bridges. That stuff rarely exists (at least where I fish). I can see logs or boulders on my SI but they aren't anything special that would hold fish."
1025999,grimsbylander,2018-04-09 01:23:00,3016,"It's my opinion that it is a very good tool but it's not a replacement for 2D sonar. There are so many variables on individual lakes, depths, and fishing techniques that side scan is just another tool in the box. If I'm fishing up shallow(<10), I never turn it on. On Lake Erie I use it all the time! Just a couple of boulders in the middle of nowhere can hold 2-3 big fish. There's just so much water that having the ability to scan a wide swath of water can mean a world of difference. I use a good map, 2D and side/down scanning together to find fish holding structure, not fish."
1026001,OhioFisherman,2018-04-09 01:47:00,6623,"chris I have no experience at all with them, and even the two I had on my boat were old technology. The ability though to see anything that might hold fish farther off to the side of the boat just seems to be a plus to me, a rock pile, change in bottom contour could be a difference. I think that they use the standing trees and sunken bridges as examples? but weeds and weed beds? Schools of baitfish or larger fish off to one side? Just getting a hint that there might be something on the side to checkout saves time and gas?"
1026002,chris.brock,2018-04-09 01:47:00,4053,"What unit do you have GBL? My Helix 5 SI is only good to about 30 FOW max. I don't like DI either. I get way more definition and information on regular sonar. Maybe it's the Helix 5, maybe it's me, lol.   "
1026003,Lape0019,2018-04-09 01:52:00,647,"There’s a place and time for everything and having used Si with a buddy a few times was enough to convince me to get it on the new boat. Unlike 2d, you have to be moving at a slower rate to take advantage of si but the imaging it can produce can quickly cut down the time of searching for structure. You can find bait apps and structure as well as fish but finding fish isn’t what most use it for. The fish holding structure is what you are looking for. Find it, and you’ll find the fish."
1026007,John Bacon,2018-04-09 03:42:00,3277,"I think you may be confusing side imaging with the old side view transducers.  I doubt that you are going to see 240' off to the side with side imaging.  	Years ago, many of the sonars had a transducers pointing horizontally to side.  They may have give a view 240' to the side.  I don't think any of the manufacturers even make those anymore; so it probably wasn't that useful.  	The new side imaging technology shows a lot of detail down and to the side of your boat; not 240' off to the side. "

However I can see me getting back to Bass fishing in shallow water sometime in the future, and unless the unit with side imaging is much more than standard down imaging I would go with it. I have a question for all. What is the difference in price?"
1026011,OhioFisherman,2018-04-09 04:09:00,6623,http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Humminbird_Helix_10_Sonar/descpage-HTS.html Here is a link to prices on a helix 10 with different features.
1026013,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-09 04:38:00,8243,"Thanks Ohio, I'll be sticking with what I have for the price difference. I only was on a boat that had it once here on Erie and past 30 feet I couldn't see much, again I am a rookie at it. Same as the Capt. new to him too. Once we get past 5 mile reef at the east corner of the Long Point Elbow the bottom is flat, flat as the Salt Flats on all sides. If there is a bump on the bottom at 80 feet most likely a body with Woodbridge loafers."
1026015,OhioFisherman,2018-04-09 05:01:00,6623,"Watching them guys fish the classic was sort of an eye opener to me, they probably have more cash tied up in their electronics than I did for my last boat new. 15 inch displays and such? I didn't see any budget electronics and there was references made about video game fishing. Just from my smallie days on Lake Erie? finding them when you are seeing a 6 to 8 foot wide piece of the bottom at a time was time consuming, especially when the area with the rocky bottom was  a few miles long. It's a lot easier to justify the expense if need it for your job?"
1026016,boombap,2018-04-09 08:28:00,310,Still waiting for the day for a side imaging unit with no gps.. should help the price.
1026017,porkpie,2018-04-09 10:41:00,2521,"That kind of defeats the purpose.  I don't know what the hummingbird units are like, but I know that on my lowrance I can locate some rocks to the side of my boat, and immediately press my finger down on the screen over the rockpile.  This stops the screen and let's me put a waypoint down immediately so I can swing around on it and do my next pass either right beside it or right over it.  I would find it far less useful without GPS."
1026019,Garnet,2018-04-09 10:55:00,2056,"Si on a trolling motor is mostly useless. Every time you turn the screen blurs. Si you sit at console and drop way points on rock piles weed edges  , ledges so trolling with rods in holds would work, you need to stay at 2 mph and drive strait or it blurs. Lake Ont useless. Bacon has a pic of 360 much different than SI. It's like a radar circling your boat and takes some practise to intrepid. Works well on trolling motor when fishing. Price $1500 for transducer , a 9-10 inch  dictate unit  to 360 and then you can network with other units. Price 4k. Then we could talk about Garmin Panotics wick expensive."
