If anyone is willing, please click the link below, and then give a thumbs up on the review from S. Leistra. Shouldn't take more than a couple seconds. I am hoping that if there is enough traffic on this review it will wake them up a bit. The review is actually an interesting read if you have the time. Lots of other unfavourable reviews there too, many regarding the same person, if you have time to scroll through what others say. Thanks for your time, it is much appreciated! https://www.google.ca/search?source=hp&ei=6zfRWsC8HKuMjwSDnpLgAQ&q=waterloo+dodge&oq=waterloo+dodge&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0l10.3284.6243.0.8275.15.12.0.2.2.0.264.1585.0j9j2.11.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.13.1637.0..0i131k1j0i10k1j0i131i10k1.0.egr_NUdaAbc#lrd=0x882bf47cecaf195b:0x7f17a5b58982b258,1,,,"
