If I read this correctly, I could fish for crappie anytime of the year.  I just cannot fish within 100m of the causeway between Nov 16 and the 2nd Sat in May...  Lake Scugog - 100 m (328 ft.) on both sides of Hwy. 7A (causeways) - Scugog Twp.    -     Fish sanctuary - no fishing from Jan. 1 - Fri. before 2nd Sat. in May & Nov. 16 - Dec. 31."

1025826,GBW,2018-04-06 22:05:00,8460,Yeah John you can fish it all year for crappie and perch.  Just make sure you are not in the closed areas and good to go
