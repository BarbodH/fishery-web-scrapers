A local fishing tackle store might also provide some info? If you're new to it a club isn't a bad starting point, it can open up new waters and opportunities, they can also be a place to learn."
1025803,Garnet,2018-04-06 11:15:00,2056,Tournaments every weekend on Rice . CSFL did have a couple Wed night tourneys not sure about now.

1025809,Stoty,2018-04-06 13:11:00,2910,"CSFL is doing the twilight event on Scugog this year, according to their website. July 14 & 15th are the dates on Rice for CSFL."
1025811,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-06 14:08:00,273,"The Peterborough Bassmasters tournaments are for club members.  They have no entry fee and no winning $.  The evening tournies they run are rare and are for the club members to be social.  Their weekend tournies are more frequent and no $ to enter and no winning $. They are for gaining points for an end of year score and club party.  Their philosophy on the tournies are to be casual, social low pressure events. The annual Rice Lake Open the Peterborough Bassmasters host is that ... a one day event and the club simply hosts it.  It is open to anyone.  http://peterboroughbassmasters.ca/rice-lake-open/ There are some groups that do casual evening tournies that anyone can join for a few $ and possible win a little $.  I don't know about Rice Lake but I do know about ones that run out of Bridgenorth (stopping in at Bridgenorth Sports and asking about these is a good start) as well as Mike Williams of Williams Outfitters runs casual weeknight tournies on different lakes.  He has a Facebook page you can join for announcements on when and where they are going to happen.  Here is his Facebook page -> https://www.facebook.com/groups/1132031450187547/   His dedicated website is -> http://williamsoutfitters.com/"
1025813,OhioFisherman,2018-04-06 15:37:00,6623,"It's sort of like networking? Get yourself involved and you can find more opportunities by word of mouth? There are electric motor only lakes here, limited horsepower lakes lakes and bass clubs to fit the laws and budgets. Some guys from the club I was in started having Wednesday evening pick up tournaments once a month at a small local water supply reservoir. It  was electric motor only and 20 bucks entry fee per person, winner takes all. Fun fishing with a payout?"
