1025824,GBW,2018-04-06 21:55:00,8460,I recall seeing others saying happy with them for the price
1025828,bigugli,2018-04-06 22:13:00,6138,I'll be buying a new pair of script polarized lenses. They do make a huge difference.
1025876,camillj,2018-04-07 20:13:00,1988,Yes Ive used em and they are fine ... and for $20 you cant go wrong
1025878,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-07 20:22:00,8243,"I had a pair of Tommy Bahamas that were dark reading glasses too. Around 300 bucks. I was afraid to take them out of the house. I can't find them but the dozen or more pair of cheap sunglasses are all accounted for, should be a song. They may be on the boat, I doubt it. I am becoming my mother ad father. 5 layers of plastic on the good furniture and blankets, never saw it until we moved them."
1026169,Canuck,2018-04-11 10:06:00,491,Costco on line has the Maui Jim Legacy glasses in Brown/Bronze and Black/Grey for $129.  Web site says that they may be in your local store too.  They will be cheaper than that in the stores but they don't last long until they are gone.  I think I will grab a grey lens pair if they are close to $100. https://www.costco.ca/Maui-Jim-Legacy-Sunglasses.product.100388228.html
1026175,BassMan11,2018-04-11 14:22:00,583,"Been through the whole array of polarized glasses. Cheap CT Rapalas, and Strike Kings, Oakley's, and now Maui Jim's. For me the difference was night and day even between the Oakley's and Maui's. 0 eye fatigue at all being outside all day.... and also great for driving or anything else. Personally I have matte black Maui Jim Pheai with the glass HCL bronze lenses and they are fantastic. Easy to clean and good for all around sunlight conditions. Also the Maui Warranty is second to none in the sunglasses world. If you can afford quality sunglasses...... get them."
1026176,G.mech,2018-04-11 14:45:00,830,I see on the Costco site that the manufacturer's warranty does not apply...not sure how that would work..??
1026387,Canuck,2018-04-14 00:36:00,491,Costco refunds your price almost no questions asked.   You cant get a repair though.
1026406,Dan668,2018-04-14 03:25:00,1120,"For me they are definitely worth it. I use 580g Costas, green lenses on Sunny days, sunrise silver lenses in lower light. My brother strictly uses Oakleys, and after trying the green lens from my Costas, he wanted a pair. No fatigue, easy to see what i am fishing in shallow waters, and it protects my eyes when fishing with multiple people on my boat."

1024084,Lape0019,2018-03-06 20:36:00,647,"I know I wrote a book on Oakley's but I have tried a few different brands. Oakley, I have had multiple pairs in both regular and polarized over the years. They seem to be the most comfortable and their lenses are great. Maui Jim (since the were mentioned. I had the sport with ruby lenses. Great pair of indestructible glasses and are super light, I did not however find theym great for fishing. Great for day to day though Ray Ban (no idea the model) Great clarity but nothing better than Oakley and because they were open around the sides, let a lot of light in. Revo. Guide small. These are my current day set. They have great clarity, shed water like no tomorrow (no waterspot. I have the blue water lens They also come with a float that goes around your head (I never used this). The downside is they are not very comfortable.. In all honesty, I would still go with Oakley over any of these other ones. They just work better. I will either be going back to another set of Oakleys or buyng some Costa's. The biggest thing to look for is that the frame does not allow like onto the backside of the lens. This just seems to help with seeing deeper into the water column."
1024087,misfish,2018-03-06 21:47:00,29133,"x3. I cant be out with out them. I do get caught from time to time and I feel it pretty fast as my left eye reminds me, hey stupid, get your shades on. dumbass."
1024089,craigdritchie,2018-03-06 22:10:00,1586,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet but the other big reason to always fish with glasses is safety.  A few years back I had a steelhead shake off as I was about to beach it ... hook popped out, the bend-over rod recoiled and a split shot cracked the lens of my (prescription) polarized lens. If I hadn't been wearing the glasses, I would have caught that sinker with my eyeball ... not a pretty thought. I won't fish without them. Ever."
1024094,misfish,2018-03-07 00:46:00,29133,Someone did.  Keep in mind that they are also a safety device for incoming or outgoing lures.

1024096,grimsbylander,2018-03-07 01:13:00,3016,"Haven't we all!!?? lol When I was young I got a big 'ol plug snagged in a fallen tree. You guessed it...one good tug too many and that this came back to the boat like a rocket; smacked me right between the eyes. Mono stretches really well and those double trebles help it fly!! LOL My glasses saved me and I wear them constantly now. I knew a guy that fished Lake O for salmon and used to joke he didn't need good glasses because he didn't need to see the fish! At the end of every day his eyes looked like pee holes in the snow from squinting all day. Finally he wore a old pair of H2O's I had...the joking stopped and he bought decent glasses. Miraculously, he said he doesn't get headaches now when he's out too long! geesh"
1024097,SirCranksalot,2018-03-07 01:50:00,3291,Do they fit over your glasses?
1024098,dave524,2018-03-07 02:03:00,4508,"Yes , They come with the eyeglass frames when you get glasses, they are polarized and attach with magnets. go down to easy clip video https://aspexeyewear.com/en/technologies/"
1024107,Mister G,2018-03-07 11:21:00,1429,"Walmart use to sell Berkley Polarized Sunglasses for believe it or not..........$5 . . .  I purchased 7 pairs over several visits there. My boat has 2 pairs, my truck has two pairs, my wife's car has one pair, the fridge on my back yard deck holds one pair and the last pair is in the house."
1024109,limeyangler,2018-03-07 13:28:00,5204,"Interesting, thanks for posting, I don't do much wading, but yeah, when climbing over rocks etc, you could easily miss a step with the reader part at the bottom. I'm just waiting till next year when my benefits renew, then I'm getting a pair of decent prescription graduated bifocal polarized shades."
1024110,Fisherman,2018-03-07 13:38:00,7201,"Definitely worth it.  A long time ago I ended up with sunburned eyes from not wearing sun glasses, felt like my eyes were full of sand.  I don't ever want to go through that again."
1024111,dave524,2018-03-07 14:00:00,4508,"Yeah , when I got my first pair of bifocals I thought I had shrunk a foot the ground seemed much closer . My uncle was a mechanic, he had a set of prescription bifocals with the reader at the top over 30 years ago for working under a vehicle up on a hoist.  edit; somewhere I have seen flip down readers that you can attach to glasses maybe a Lee Valley catalog that would work for wading."
1024114,Jon,2018-03-07 14:03:00,209,Polarized sunglasses are an absolute necessity in my mind. I can't remember the last time I went for a walk along a stream or fishing without them. I have always bought smoke grey lenses so I can't speak to the benefits of other colours. The safety aspects have already been mentioned but I would add that sunglasses will also help getting branches in the eye when walking through the woods to your favourite trout spot. I also use circular polarizing filters on my camera to cut the glare in the sky or through the water. The difference is amazing and much better pictures.  Jon
1024115,AKRISONER,2018-03-07 14:32:00,5558,"been very happy with my Spy Discords, ive had them for 4 years they are very comfortable and dont make you look like a middle aged white guy or guy fieri"
1024118,manitoubass2,2018-03-07 14:48:00,11391,"Lol. That's funny because it's true  Heaven forbid I ever wear these backups I have lol. Most are nice slim fit glasses, lightweight. Then I have one pair that makes me feel like I'm wiz khalifa ?????"
1024119,msp,2018-03-07 14:51:00,1336,Yes ! 100% I wont fish without them. I always have a couple extra pairs in the boat in case I forget mine. A must have
1024128,AKRISONER,2018-03-07 15:55:00,5558,"theres a changing tide in fishing fashion...a buddy and I clued into about 5 years ago that there was a market of fishermen who were somewhat hypebeast/street fashion conscious with absolutely no one catering to them.  yes of course bass pro trucker hats and flannel shirts will still dominate fishing fashion as long as folks from texas, alabama and georgia have anything to say about it...  But check out the likes of Bass Brigade, Bassers United and Warbaits...  My buddy and I made a little bit clothing under the ""trophies fishing"" banner check the logo on the hat, flat beaks, normal sunglasses lol you get the idea   "

1024145,camillj,2018-03-07 17:19:00,1988,Me three ... as much as I love my Maui Jims and do feel they were worth the extra $$ ... my most important thing for use in fishing is the polarized part ... you'll know they are good if you turn your head sideways and look at the clouds ... if the clouds don't change hue the glasses are no good ... and the other most important thing is clean and unscratched lenses ... I go through so many I normally buy the $20 pairs for fishing (and always have an extra pair on hand for anyone who comes along with me and realizes their fancy-schmancy glasses aren't worth a crap (no matter how much they paid) because they aren't polarized or are too scratched up.  I also agree with the safety ... been saved more than a few times when a boating partner got a little carried away on their hook-set (its not just when the pike decides for one last head-shake - just saying)
1024147,BillM,2018-03-07 17:54:00,17367,Fashion and fishing what has this world come to lol
1024155,Lape0019,2018-03-07 20:43:00,647,The unscratched lens part is very true. That is why I am considering the glass costas. They do not scratch as easily.
1024163,SirCranksalot,2018-03-07 22:38:00,3291,Thx--I'll check it out.
1024168,GBW,2018-03-07 22:51:00,8460,Yes very true. For fishing I like an amber lenses and driving a light grey
1024027,LittleWorm,2018-03-06 07:21:00,122,"Well as the title says, are polarized fishing glasses really worth it? I have never used them so I don't know anything about them. I would take it though that the more you pay for a set the better they will be? Please let me know what you think, worth it or scam. Thanks"
1024028,scuro2,2018-03-06 10:10:00,904,"It depends on the fishing. I wouldn't bonefish without them. If you like to do the majority of your fishing trolling or jigging it wouldn't be worth a good pair. Ditto if you are fishing low visibility water which would include some cottage lakes.   	But, if you stand when you fish and the point of contact isn't too far away AND the water is clear you may see fish before they see you and you can sight fish and target them. You'll also see some hits which I don't know if it increases your hook up rates but it makes the whole experience that much more fun.  	Also if money isn't too much of an issue a great pair of glasses just makes the summer that much nicer."
1024029,buckhorn250,2018-03-06 10:11:00,85,Polarized glasses are a huge benefit. Allows you to see into the water column rather then just surface reflection. Any good quality pair of polarized glasses will do...the wrap around type that block all light from coming in from the sides are best. 
1024031,dintymoore,2018-03-06 11:18:00,62,"100%. I've had the same pair of Maui Jim's for about 5 years. Like others said, sometimes you'll spot fish before they see you. Oh and you'll see rainbows more clearly - now who doesn't like to see a rainbow?"
1024034,limeyangler,2018-03-06 11:47:00,5204,"They cut the glare from the water too, so even if you are not needing to see the fish....after 12 hours on the water on a bright day my eyes are grateful too."
1024035,G.mech,2018-03-06 11:58:00,830,I like them but find they make your electronic screens almost impossible to see.  The bent glass on my windshield becomes hard to see through as well when you have them on....
1024039,chris.brock,2018-03-06 13:48:00,4053,"It's not a scam at all, they work.

1024040,G.mech,2018-03-06 14:00:00,830,But MEC sells other stuff that's marketed by a supplier who also markets guns....can't shop there or the profits from these sun glasses are effectively going straight to the NRA right?

1024043,jimmer,2018-03-06 14:09:00,2730,I can't fish without them. Helps to see under the surface and protects your eyes from the glare; just as others have said.

It's great when they help see in the water column, but as others have said, it's eye protection. Against the sun, glare and possible incoming lures. Once you use them there really is no going back  "
1024050,Lape0019,2018-03-06 15:21:00,647,"Polarized glasses are good for anything and not just for fishing. They cut the glare out everything. I wear a pair every day driving to work. and have a set in the boat in case I forget the others in the car (kept my older pair). If you're not convinced, buy a pair of cheap ones to start. No matter the price, they still work. Once you're convinced, step up to a better pair. I prefer Oakley sunglasses for comfort and clarity. They are still a ""plastic"" (for lack of a better word) lens but have some of the best clarity out there. I use the Shallow blue lens for shallow water. They also offer a deep blue lens for deeper water (see where this is going? LOL). There is a third lens but I do not know if they make it anymore. I suggest you go on their website and check out the fishing specific glasses. Look at the lens information and go from there. I personally do not like the styles of their fishing glasses but you can get most of the lens options in other models of frames. If you really want to treat yourself, the ones that get the most positive reviews seem to be the Costa's with the 580 glass lense. They will be heavier but anyone I know who has used them, absolutely loves them for comfort and clarity. If you haven't guess by my response, I 100% believe you get what you pay for in a polarized lens. yeah, they make a profit but the R&D of these things have to be paid somewhere. Plus, you only get one set of eyes so you may as well take care of them."
1024054,BillM,2018-03-06 15:57:00,17367,I always have a grey pair and bronze pair of Maui Jims on me at all times when in the boat.  Absolutely  indispensable.

1024062,Snidley,2018-03-06 16:41:00,620,Not only for fishing but polarized glasses really help with reading a green in golf. Yellow lenses for that application.

1024066,limeyangler,2018-03-06 17:25:00,5204,That is so true. I do however have a solution for that for those that wear reading glasses. The sunglasses with the reader lens built in at the bottom of the lenses are great because the magnified reading lense part is not polarized.
1024068,DRIFTER_016,2018-03-06 17:38:00,10439,These are my river fishing glasses. The readers at the top are way better for this purpose.

1024073,Freshtrax,2018-03-06 18:24:00,2215,My maui jims are worth their weight. In gold.  If you have health benefits can likely get a pair from the optometrist.    I drive 5-6 hours a day for work and have the slightest prescription.   They really help with fatigue  and helping spot fish.
