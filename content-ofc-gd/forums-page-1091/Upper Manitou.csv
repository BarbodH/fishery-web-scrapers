We have been to Nielsen's on Rowan Lake several times and have had a great experience and would highly recommend it to anyone.  However, some of our group want to explore some place new.  Can anyone tell me about the Upper Manitou and Green Island Lodge in particular?  I appreciate your help.  John Steffens Arlington, Texas"
