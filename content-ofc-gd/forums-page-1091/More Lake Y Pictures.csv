154958,Casey123,2008-01-28 23:38:00,461,"Sorry Jen  ,  We don't like sharing our fishing spots, especially when there as good as the river in front of your place.  Had we known we would have saved our selves a trip to Dog Lake last year.  Anyways you guys have a great place and we will be back again soon(When I get back on the 23 of Feb)"
155044,Jen,2008-01-29 01:56:00,833," I don't mind sharing my fishing spots, it just means more people will have the opportunity to enjoy great moments.  Thank you for the compliment on our place.  Both Steve (fishmaster) and I are enjoying it greatly... a little piece of paradise in an otherwise hectic world.  Look forward to seeing you again!  Cheers,  Jen  p.s.  I got my first walleye through the ice today... I think you will know exactly where that was."
155054,Casey123,2008-01-29 02:03:00,461,"Very Cool, The river channel out from that little bay was the ticket for us.  Steve said he wanted to try figuring out the night bite on the river, when i get back home I am going to try to do exactly that.  We marked and caught more fish in three hours there then we have at many places further up North.  Congrats and my wife and I will see you in a couple of weeks."
