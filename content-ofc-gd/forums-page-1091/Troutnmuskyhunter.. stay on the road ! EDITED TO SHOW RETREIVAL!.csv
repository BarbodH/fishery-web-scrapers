154969,taper,2008-01-29 00:15:00,611,Wayne I thought you were a good guy before that comment.  :blahblah1:
154970,irishfield,2008-01-29 00:17:00,26272,
154987,Joey,2008-01-29 00:58:00,9122,Very cool Wayne.  No aquaview pictures?  Joey
154990,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 01:08:00,3421,Wow that was great of you to post that Wayne.  Oh and Terry that was funny what you said about pictering TJ in front with a crew of Hunters and their rifles
155055,Sinker,2008-01-29 02:04:00,8692,You'd think those fella's have done this before.....pretty slick rigging!  First time I've seen that system. Looks like it worked great though....  Thanks for posting that!!  Sinker
155161,SlowPoke,2008-01-29 06:11:00,2984,The truck has to come out regardless. If left in there and discovered it would be pretty easy to figure out who would foot the bill. I would imagine the fines and recovery costs would cost more than his house. -Brian
154050,irishfield,2008-01-25 03:33:00,26272,"Steve...if you haven't left yet, be careful. Don't wanna these guys to be fishing your truck out as well. Don't have the full story yet... but figure the truck went down earlier and the ice is finally thick enough to support trying to haul it up. Looks like these guys have done this before!       "
154051,Sinker,2008-01-25 03:41:00,8692,Thats one hell of a tripod!!  I hope the truck is under it......LOL!  Don't forget to post the results!  Sinker
154052,irishfield,2008-01-25 03:43:00,26272,"I'm just waiting to see who the lucky diver is. Not sure my realestate agent, that recoved my camera in the spring from 35 FOW, can get into his dry suit anymore after packing on his winter ""coat""!"
154054,huntervasili,2008-01-25 03:54:00,1604,"Thats going to be one heck of a truck recovery... Neat pics, will definitely be awaiting the results"

154057,irishfield,2008-01-25 04:06:00,26272,Who washed that one Andy?
154058,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-25 04:14:00,0,Was from a member on another site who posted it from this season. Works like a charm that fishing rig does.
154063,Musky or Specks,2008-01-25 05:12:00,2710,Helped use one of those rigs before on Temagami to bring up an Alpine that went through the ice back when Paul and Julia use to run Temagami Lodge. I hope it wasnt one of the big plows they use up there cause I dont think that tripod would be big enough.
154098,solopaddler,2008-01-25 13:17:00,8605,That's incredible! I can't wait to see the ending.
154103,Smokey,2008-01-25 13:31:00,1278,Great shots. Would have been something to see in person. I bet thats a costly job.
154141,irishfield,2008-01-25 16:04:00,26272, It's just a pick up with a plow on it.
154194,PAZE,2008-01-25 20:30:00,132,Try explaining that one to the insurance company
154196,irishfield,2008-01-25 20:40:00,26272,"""Got lost in a white out and next thing I knew I was swimming.....""  There is nothing in the fine print of my vehicle policy, that I can see, that says I can't drive on the ice. Especially a maintained ice road."
154200,irishfield,2008-01-25 21:28:00,26272,I'm told that the dive to hook onto the truck will be at Noon Saturday... in between hockey games.  Maybe TroutnMuskiehunter will get us some first hand pictures while he's there!
154271,fishindevil,2008-01-26 03:14:00,6254,"That system is really cool..  .i have never seen that done before !!! looking forward to the raising, thanks for sharing guys....cheers"
154922,irishfield,2008-01-28 22:17:00,26272,Here's the retrieval shots ! Another reason to have a class IV hitch on your truck ! Back up / Safety diver getting Mat ready is my Realestate Agent Barry Graham. Also shows how clear this lake is...using the aquaview in 50+ feet of water.           
154926,Whopper,2008-01-28 22:25:00,2174,Wild stuff Wayne!  I wouldn't have wanted to be the guy next to the whole that is bent over though
154929,irishfield,2008-01-28 22:35:00,26272,The part that surprises me the most is the pulley anchored into the ice..instead of the cable just going up directly to the top...but I guess that keeps the pull angle below level so that the pulling trucks don't get there ass end lifted and it also negates pulling the tri-pod over.
154942,glen,2008-01-28 23:05:00,2641,Did they find any fish in it?  Look they caught a 20'er.  Thanks for the pics.
154945,solopaddler,2008-01-28 23:09:00,8605,"Wow, cool! I think I've got a better understanding now how the pyramids were built."
154947,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-28 23:15:00,1362,Wow Wayne.....awesome pics....we didn't get to see the excitement but were told to be careful out there because a truck had gone though in ~80' of water at Bear Island!!!  What I got a kick out of was watching the tandem plow truck plowing the ice rd between Bear Island and the access rd....couldn't pay me enough to do that!!
154948,Terry,2008-01-28 23:16:00,14456,I don't know why but every time I see this one I expect to see TJ and his friends posing with there rifles infront of the hanging trophy 
154952,FishFinder,2008-01-28 23:29:00,481,wouldnt it be cheaper to buy a new truck
154954,Casey123,2008-01-28 23:33:00,461,Thats a preety big Accu View Tripod!
154962,irishfield,2008-01-28 23:51:00,26272, Truck's owned by the lads that built the whole thing. Doubt there was any direct financial cost to anyone other than the hours lost off of a cottage build that should have been going on... in a community like Temagami it's like a Menanite barn raising... you just show up and work. Divers... it's an opportunity to practice and doubt a $100 changed hands if that to cover the air in the tanks.  Plow is worth $7500 alone... GM truck.. not much I agree! LOL
