155163,BENNY,2008-01-29 06:28:00,37,It is a very nice package with a nice price but I really want the wrap around windshield.....Not just the dual console..
155165,SlowPoke,2008-01-29 06:32:00,2984,"I can understand that, just wanted to make sure you didn't overlook Aaron's boat. He'd probably be the best person to talk to about the pro's/con's.... shoot him a PM. Good luck! -Brian"
