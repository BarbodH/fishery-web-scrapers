Make sure you run the auger for a minute or two after you finish and make sure you clean out any wet stuff that is still in the blower. If you don't, it'll freeze and that can cause belts and friction discs to wear out much faster than normal the next time you go to use it or even break a shear pin."

Just moved the two feet of snow that came crashing down off most of the roofs around here and slop 'ing the slush out of the laneway. Remember that bent storage trailer of mine...well it is now a garbage compactor !  And here... now it's a fishing post...
