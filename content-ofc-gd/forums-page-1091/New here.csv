154988,gekhunter,2008-01-29 01:02:00,61,"Just want to say hi to all, been checking out for a couple weeks but have yet to post.  I fish as much as I can which is not as much as I want of course...when I get out Walleye is usually prime target but I also enjoy LMB, SMB and Pike from time to time and perch on the ice (report to come).  Looking to explore other species as well, such as musky, lakers and whitefish and hope to learn more from the people here.  Here are a few pics from last year...  Week in Nippissing in early June.  It rained like I have never seen it rain before.  I am actually happy with these eyes but too cold and soggy to smile!  also, had to put 'em back due to the slot...not to complain since they might not be there without.  anyway, the best morning we had we got 10  around this size off a nice nice shoal over about 5 or 6 hours.       And, my PB 7.2 lb walleye, caught in BoQ in late sept casting my trustee canadian wiggler into some thick weeds...not much of fish for quinte but i have never been out there and never caught one this size.     Cheers,  Greg"
