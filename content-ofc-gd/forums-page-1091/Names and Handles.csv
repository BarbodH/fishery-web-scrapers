153512,kennyman,2008-01-23 16:46:00,737,"My nickname is pretty simple. My first name is Ken and my buddy LJ (Little John), speaking of nicknames, often says in a cool tone ""What's up Mr. Kennyman"" or something very similar (different variations) and since it was the only nickname I really ever had (other than lardass,idiot etc.) it sort of stuck. That and if you try to use Ken,Kenny etc. it's usually been taken. This reminds me ........... hmmm ..... how about a little story here?   Has anyone ever done this?Remember this is a LONG time ago.  I'm out of town with a long time friend Scott (no nickname) on one of our spur of the moment ""missions"". We come out of a coffee shop and right above where we are parked is a street sign for ""Little John Lane"". Needless to say, we couldn't get out the wrenches fast enough. That sign was brought home with us and donated to Little John. He still has it to this day. Man, to be young and foolish again ............ or at least young."

I'm in the heattreating business. I had to FISH out parts that fell off hooks and into a 4ft deep pot of 1400 F molten salt with a long stainless steel hook. You couldn't see the bottom so you had to feel around with the hook to locate the missing parts. Although I wore the silver suit and other appropriate heat resistant gear, my face would get cooked looking into the molten pot. I covered the shield on my helmet so that I was blind (kinda like Luke Skywalker with his blast shield down while practising his light saber). I always managed to out fish the other guys by Fishing with the Force."

Anyway the next day my buddies started calling me the chicken thief. About a week later I got my first CB radio and since everyone used handles I had to come up with one. It ended up being ""The Northern Ontario Chicken Thief"" which I used for years. There are still some collector cards around from way back then somewhere.  When I started getting into message boards, that handle just didn't seem appropriate any more and since my name is Cliff and my son's name is Cliff our friends often refered to us as Big Cliff and Little Cliff..... Big Cliff just sort of stuck."

152892,Bernie,2008-01-21 23:38:00,3190,"The thought occurred to me over the weekend ""how did the name handle thing get started?"". In the past in my old Citizen Band days (CB's for those are too young to remember) we used ""handles"" instead of our real names or our license number. The reason we used handles back then was because many were not licensed or would run more wattage than we were allowed to talk further away. Has this tradition carried to discussion boards in some manner? Mostly none of us here have little or nothing to hide from so I suppose it is all just for fun. Some people here use their real names Rick, Lew, Joey , Gerritt, Roy, Corey, Dan, Terry and so on. Then there are some folks who use their trade/profession for a handle; hometownhandyman, aplumma, daplumma, Hearingfish, Headhunter, BPSBASSMAN and so on. Then comes the possible appropriate ones. The first one that comes to mind is ""misfish"" Now I have never fished with Brian but why did he pick a name like that?  . Solopaddler is known for his forays into the wilderness on his own and his great posts on them. Moosebunk is also a great story teller with a fun twist to them. Now last but not least is the one that sticks out from all the rest, yes you guessed it, Greencoachdog   ????  What is that? Just thought I would toss in a little fun topic here."

My first internet handle was ""fret""...which is a part of a guitar...not someone who worries all the time.  It morphed into ccmt because many sites years ago had to have at least 4 characters to a username.  I added the 'canada' part because believe it or not, ccmt was taken already when I joined yahoo.  Some people thought I worked for the hockey company ccm, and others thought the cmt meant ""Country music television"".  If you've seen my band's videos, you know this is NOT the case...LOL."

I've been known to ""get into it"" with other posters from time to time(not here to many mods, LOL) and I would never hide behind some alias...But when I discovered the fishing sites like this one most people seemed to have a ""handle"" so I picked Pigeontroller since I have a trailer on Pigeon Lake and have spent many hours trolling for the elusive Muskie(I actually prefer casting).

You don't want to spell out to the Enemy that there are Engineers in the Area, or Starlite meaning Medic, Watchdog MP, Sunray your Commander.  Kind of Gives it away on what might be happening.  These days the nicknames really don't matter anymore with today's radio security, however nicknames still exist.  As far as using my real name, I don't think so unless I know someone.  I figure whilst using a public forum, probably better not to advertise who you are.  For example  being called a racist or getting someone angry because of my opinions or views as there are sensitive people who take things really personal or out of context.  There are weirdos out there."
