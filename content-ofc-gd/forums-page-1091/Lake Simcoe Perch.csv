It was my first trip up there but I had the benefit of going with some experienced anglers who had been before so I was dreaming of some biguns...and wasn't dissappointed.  Fished all day with 3 others on Thursday and Friday from about 8:30-4:00.  The bite seemed to be hot from 9-11 and 2-4 each day, not sure if that is coincidence or what but when it was hot it was great, couldn't get the line back in fast enough and also got plenty of double headers.  We were in 20 FOW and fishing right on the bottom.  Nothing exceptional as far as jumbos are concerned but definitely what I consider a great outing.  Also, on Friday in particular, we noticed a school (about 6 at a time) of another species roaming around just as far as we could see at about 17 FOW.  We figured they were whitefish?  Any other guesses?  Anyway, couldn't get em to hit,  though one did attack my split shots.  Here are some pics  Double header...    The biggest we got- 12.5"" fatty    Thursday's reward...    Friday's reward...    My future perch slayer...    Finally, dinner (what a job it is cleaning those after being stuck in toronto traffic after a day on the ice- but well worth it!)        Greg"

155286,Jen,2008-01-29 15:04:00,833,"I see your little one likes to watch then in the sink when you get home as well.  Last year mine kept bringing the perch back to life in the sink before I had to clean them... Can't buy that kind of fun for kids, can't wait to see your post with his first fish!  Cheers  Nice catch  Jen"
155292,Sandbag,2008-01-29 15:19:00,533,Good stuff Greg  I saw a video report on another board of a school like you mentioned swimming around.  The concensus there was that the school of fish were herring.   Cheers  Craig
