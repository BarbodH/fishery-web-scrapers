154995,jhm,2008-01-29 01:13:00,15,Well after a tough morning ( zero fish) I asked Steve for some advice where to fish this evening ............And man did he come threw for me............We hammered them............8 fish caught kept 7..........The bite is on go see Fishmaster he'll put you on them.........Most of the fish we're caught on small buckshots (silver and black was the hot ticket) unfortunately for me my brother had the only one......... glows only caught a couple fish..........I hope you have some in stock I'll be needing some in the morning............ See you bright and early.........Here's a couple pics...............JHM ;D ;D ;D ;D
