152740,ccmtcanada,2008-01-21 16:15:00,7971,This is why I dont ice fish....LOL.  Hope it gets fixed soon....haha
152742,jedimaster,2008-01-21 16:23:00,3472,ccmtcanada...so what yor saying is the open water regs are easier to understand?
152743,ccmtcanada,2008-01-21 16:26:00,7971," Not at all jedi...just that I hate cold weather, so I thought I'd just use this as another excuse not to icefish...."
152744,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-21 16:29:00,1362,I'm still walkin around with that e-mail copy in my pocket and don't what to do wit it
152762,jedimaster,2008-01-21 17:35:00,3472, Thats what I figured but I thought I would give you the benifit of the doubt.
153249,lovetofish,2008-01-22 21:18:00,500,"Still didn't get an emails from the MNR, but went out today anyways!!!  The perch love this snowy weather!!!!   lovetofish"
153276,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-22 22:33:00,253,I dont want to muddy the waters again but I called the Guelph MNR office yesterday to enquire about this reg . She informed me that it is not a miss print or error in the new regs I had to register my portable Clam hut because it was lager than the stated size in the reg.I think its a stupid rule but really it only took 5 minutes of my time and its better than a fine.
153284,Terry,2008-01-22 22:41:00,14456,I am still waiting for my reply from the MNR
153301,misfish,2008-01-22 23:11:00,29133,"It,s simple,.    JUST SAY NO"
153531,jedimaster,2008-01-23 18:29:00,3472,Still waiting....Maybe I'll call again and put some of that tax money to work.
153538,jedimaster,2008-01-23 18:45:00,3472,"Ok, so I talked to the person in charge and they said that someone from the aurora office will call me later today to confirm but she thought that anything over 21.5 square feet needs to be registered. I told her that I talked to the aurora office last week and they said if we remove it daily it doesn't need to be registered. She said hmm thats strange, I'll have to call you back.  Damn that BUS."
154883,Joey,2008-01-28 19:39:00,9122,"I just called to get my registration number and the MNR told me I did not need one if I took the hut out with me and brought it back with me each day.  She said it was NOT enforceable!!!  I got one anyhow, don't need an argument on the ice with an MNR officer.  Joey"
154886,buckster,2008-01-28 19:52:00,530,"i was out on sat off of IBR and i ran into an mnr officer checking licenses (nice to see them out)  I asked him about this whole portable regisrty deal since im the proud owner of 2 portables.   He said not to worry,  the mnr on simcoe are not gonna enforce this silly law.  I know its not in writing but thats what he said."
154894,huntervasili,2008-01-28 20:33:00,1604,Well it may not be enforced and it may not be the brightest of all laws but I was told by a CO that it should be registered this was on saturday on Simcoe
154912,huntervasili,2008-01-28 21:24:00,1604,"Well all, It takes all of 3 minutes to register your hut... Might as well, Just have your outdoors card on hand and know your address, DOB, and name. To make it easy for ya here is the number (I am pretty sure you can call any office) to Aurora (905) 713-7400. The lady said the # is good for all of Ontario, and that if it is taken off the ice no registration is necessary but there is a lack of communication between the CO's and the district offices. But to be safe I registered mine."
155073,skeeter,2008-01-29 02:19:00,1907,"ok heres my 2 cents worth on this issue!!!!!  for the amount of time it takes you to post you could have registered your hut.. put the numbers on a piece of board just large enough to fit them, throw it into your hut .   Dann"
151971,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-18 18:34:00,1362,"This is absolutely hilarious  ......I just called the Pembroke MNR Ice Hut registration clerk to register my Clam and she said seeing how my hut is portable and I'm using it for day trip only, I don't need to register it...  Call Nancy at MNR for more info...(613) 732-5502"
151974,irishfield,2008-01-18 18:42:00,26272,"This one sounds as well dictated, to the enforcers, as the fishing muskie with a conservation license Bull !"
151975,Terry,2008-01-18 18:43:00,14456,maybe rather then a bake sale for gas for the CO's trucks we need to have a bake sale to raise money to put in phone lines so each office and personal can talk to each other..... get it together......please
151978,jedimaster,2008-01-18 19:05:00,3472,Surely they have to have email. I mean really what the heck are they doing? sending out the reg updates by pigeon? This is really shameful  in my eyes. I mean this is such a clear cut yes or no answer. Do I register my portable hut that I don't leave on the ice or no? It should be yes or no every time you call not random.
151981,wuchikubo,2008-01-18 19:24:00,1114," That was funny, they sound like they do and the probably have a pet hawk to keep the small wildlife population down, taking down the pigeons at the same time  Time to email Minister Donna Cansfield and let her in on the joke of the communication situation.  Oh, just thought, she probably has been the one sending out the messenger pigeons from Toronto thru Lew's pet hawk area."
151985,mistyriver1,2008-01-18 19:44:00,600,.
151986,Terry,2008-01-18 19:46:00,14456,"well it's free and take 5 minutes to register, so I did it ,problem solved  well the problem is not solved but I have protected myself from MNR stupidity"
151988,jedimaster,2008-01-18 19:53:00,3472,Everyone should flood the MnR Tips line with calls saying there is unregistered tarps on Lake Scugog.
151995,lovetofish,2008-01-18 20:53:00,500,just got off the phone with mnr aurora office and she told me not to register my hut because i don't need to!!!!  She said they are working on changing that because it isn't printed properly.  I asked for an email in writing and she said that she doesn't have anything in writing!???  whatever that means.  I told her about us getting different answers from different places and she was aware of it.... guess we will still have to wait  lovetofish
151999,jedimaster,2008-01-18 21:03:00,3472,Friend of mine called the aurora office yesterday about getting a number for his portable she said he needed to have one. He got his AU number and has it on his guide as of yesterday.
152000,Terry,2008-01-18 21:05:00,14456,and the wheel goes round and round
152002,irishfield,2008-01-18 21:10:00,26272,Yah.. but it's a short bus afterall....
152003,jedimaster,2008-01-18 21:10:00,3472,I am on hold right now with the Ministers office. Donna Cansfield. I will post back the results....
152005,jedimaster,2008-01-18 21:13:00,3472,They are going to call me back next back next week sometime. The person in charge of that area is gone for the day.
152007,misfish,2008-01-18 21:13:00,29133," Thats the wheels on the bus go round and round,get it right will ya.LOL  Im not doing it,no way, no how. It BULL CRAP. I say,  register this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
152017,jedimaster,2008-01-18 21:37:00,3472,"Lets face it the wheels on this bus fell off and caused a fiery 100 car pile up many km's back, long before the exit, in fact it didn't even make it fully off of the on ramp...."
152027,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-18 21:59:00,1362,"I received a return call from a senior CO this afternoon to talk about this controversial reg...we both had a few laughs during our conversation...he said that word was spreading quickly among the districts that this reg was the ""hot potato"" of the week  Technically, the way that it's worded in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, ONTARIO REGULATION 664/98, a CO could issue a citation for anyone not having a registration for a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric that has a basal area of two square metres or less when erected. O. Reg. 409/04, s. 1.  The probability of this happening to someone using a portable hut (this is his example) is compared to a police officer charging you with speeding, if he caught you doing 1km over the speed limit...  He also said that they have better things to do than walk around a portable ice hut with a measuring tape to see if it exceeds the 2 square metres ...  The bottom line is that they use common sense when it comes to issues regarding regs as this one...the whole intent of this reg is to ensure that they can contact/charge a person using the registration# in their database in the event that the ice shelter is NOT off the ice in accordance with the date for hut removal for that particular Zone.  Here's the link to the e-laws:  http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isys...es&context="
152034,wallyboss,2008-01-18 22:20:00,1095,"I sent an e-mail using the link that was put on this afternoon, then I saw the 1-800 number and I called it so I start asking him all the things I want to know but I am pretty well reading off the e-Mail I just sent and out of the Blue the guy calls me by my first name. He was reading my e-mail as I was talking to him.   So I think we will have this story straightened out pretty quickly. I warned him that I won't be the only one calling because it is going around on at least 3 Fishing Forums beside s OFC.  He told me that the reply that TMHunter received and that I printed should be good for this weekend and that he will definetly be looking into this.  Yes I know that it is easy to just get a registration number and be done with it , but that is not the point we are trying to make here.  If they expect us to follow rules and regulations it would be nice if the regs were clear and concise."
152043,Terry,2008-01-18 22:42:00,14456,if nothing else it shows the power of the internet
152045,misfish,2008-01-18 22:51:00,29133," LOL BUD Now if we could just do something with the lug nuts on the bus,s wheels. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
152051,Terry,2008-01-18 23:23:00,14456,LOL
152069,Fish Farmer,2008-01-19 01:19:00,2234,"MAN did I stir up the CRAP. This also sounds like the 2 guys fishing together coming off the ice with there catch of 51 perch in one pail. The guy with the pail in hand will be charged with 1 over his limit even if there brothers. The tires just feel off the BUS. LOL Good job we got the CP to occupy our time waiting for the ice.  Anyone reading this thread must be laughing there head off. Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes>>>>>>>>>>> You no, this is pitiful or I should say SHAMEFUL   of our goverment  . Were did my money go!!! I'll be fishing Lefroy tomorrow with my clam with no number. Brian I'm with you, they can KISS my Good luck to all you guys fishing tomorrow  . See you out there."
152078,lovetofish,2008-01-19 02:02:00,500,"If anything else, we definitely got there attention about this.  The lady that i talked to said she received at least ten phone calls today all regarding portable fish hut registrations  (that was at 3:30pm)  She also said something about it being a misprint and that the head office is in Peterborough and they are looking into it.  Kind of frustrated that she sounded so sure that i didn't need to register my hut, but wouldn't give me anything in writing   :dunno:  I agree with Brian, register this!!!   lovetofish"
152732,jedimaster,2008-01-21 16:03:00,3472,Still waiting for my phone call from the Ministers office.
152737,Terry,2008-01-21 16:13:00,14456,LOL  and I am waiting for my email reply

Yesterday when is was talking to the girl at the 1800 number, she told me if you have an issue get a hold of the fisheries biologist of that area and tell him your complaint. As ""Gronz"" says they don't even own a fishing rod."
151697,Terry,2008-01-17 15:22:00,14456,"on another website, it has been reported that it is only if being left over night  and that the MNR has said they  will be putting out a statement to confirm this  I hope it's true"

151701,Entropy,2008-01-17 15:31:00,747,"I agree registration numbers on a portable hut really don’t make sense.  I could see if the hut was going to be left set up for days on end then, yes.  But I have to ask .... “What’s the point of hut registration numbers?” ... To hold people accountable for those who – let them sink in the spring, – leave a line in the water when they are not there,  – litter.  The person who is using a portable hut is always with the portable hut, thus, accountable at all times.  Registering portable huts does not make sense.  Or am I missing a good reason to register them?  Entropy"
151712,Entropy,2008-01-17 16:11:00,747," Your CRAZY !!  Going out in an unregistered tent !@!!!!!!  Your just asking for it aren’t you!?  I think we should ban unregistered permanent huts just to be on the safe side.  My jacket is very large and poofy, perhaps it too should be registered.  “It’s like wearing a portable hut!”  LOL  This is stupid.  Entropy"

151880,camillj,2008-01-18 05:32:00,1988,Wow .. I cant believe I read this whole thread ... what a big to-do over nothing. It took me all of 5 minutes to get a LIFE-TIME registration number for my portable hut ... I got one last year because I didnt feel like taking it down everynight ... the darn thing got stolen (but thats another story) .. anyhow the number they give you stays with you forever ... I just printed mine on the 'puter and stuck it in one of those high-school plastic page protectors (like the one I use for my OFC logo (for the big derby) ... then I stitch it to the door (mine is tent like material) .... anyhow whats the big deal ....  I swear sometimes we make so much noise over the petty issues we wont be heard when we have something really important to complain about.
151885,Clampet,2008-01-18 11:01:00,1947,Register this...

151901,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-18 13:50:00,1362,"I received this e-mail from MNR this morning which clarifies the ""portable hut registration"" issue.  Hi Steve,  Please accept my apology for not sending you that email yesterday.  I got swamped and totally forgot!  I'm not at work today, but checked my voice mail this morning.  Thanks for calling back with a reminder.  So here goes:  For the 2008 ice fishing season, portable ice huts that are removed off the ice at the end of the day do not require a registration number.  As well, any shelter erected for storage or eating purposes that are removed at the end of the day also do not require a registration number.  Hope this is what you need.  Again, I'm sorry for not sending this out to you yesterday.  Happy Fishing and be careful out there.....ice conditions/thickness are not consistent.  Diane  North Bay MNR District Office 3301 Trout Lake Road, P1A 4L7 North Bay, On (705) 475-5550"
151907,wuchikubo,2008-01-18 14:00:00,1114,Thank you Steve.  (It pretty much just confirms what I've said from the beginning   )
151911,wallyboss,2008-01-18 14:17:00,1095,Thanks Steve!!!
151915,Terry,2008-01-18 14:34:00,14456,yhanks  that helps but without a last name  or email address it may be iffy  could you cut and paste the  whole thing  with your question and their answer along with email address from the MNR and just  XXXXXX@ whatever your name and address but keep theirs..  it will just help to legitimize  it  to any CO that questions it
151917,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-18 14:40:00,1362,"Terry,  The email address won't do you any good because it was sent from her home ie..Yahoo.com  Her direct line at MNR is (705) 475-5569 and the name is Diane Jenner....."
151921,Terry,2008-01-18 15:00:00,14456,thanks I sent an email so I am hoping they reply with the same answer and I will post it so it can be printed off  thanks for the info
151928,Uncle Buck,2008-01-18 15:49:00,1000,I know my FishTrap Pro has a slot where you can slide a registration number in...  most huts should have the same provision...  it's a pain in the donkey none the less though....
151931,Terry,2008-01-18 16:01:00,14456,"yeah it really is that big a deal only some people who asked the MNR were told no you don't need them and others like me were told yes you do need them....  I just want a clear in writing from the MNR office answer that I can carry with me, so when the same CO sees me on the water ,I can show him why I did not get a license"
151934,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-18 16:25:00,0,This guy said that you need to register. I called the Parry Sound District office.  Carl Woods 1-705-773-4208 His direct line.   Im sure he could FAX  what you need to know.
151935,Terry,2008-01-18 16:28:00,14456,"thanks  I guess I will get the numbers, no reply to my emails yet"
151938,Terry,2008-01-18 16:45:00,14456,"OK I called the Aurora office got my number, they need your address and your  outdoor card number and told me the number is good for all of ontario........  well better safe then sorry it could be Donny checking me out"
151940,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-18 16:48:00,1362," I just talked to Carl and he is the resource desk ""clerk"" for Parry Sound....he said that he was just going by what is printed in the 2008 regs.  ..I asked if I could speak to an enforcement officer and he informed me that they were in a total different building elsewhere in Parry Sound.."
151944,jedimaster,2008-01-18 16:53:00,3472,"I also spoke to the MnR office in Peterborough and in Bancroft and they both read the internal regulation to me word for word and both said that you NEED to have a Licence number on portable huts. The regulation States Any Tent Shelter or Object with a base of greater than 21.5 square feet that is erected, placed on, fished from or under needs to have a registration number.  It makes no mention of huts being taken off the ice exempt.  The numbers are now tied directly to your OOD card number and are permanent. Your number is your number for LIFE. You put it on all huts you have no matter what area or lake its on. You only need to register for a numebr once. You just re use the number. Btter get your number soon before the number get into  20 digit long things. I have a 4 digit number, but many areas are already giving out 8 digit ones. Just wait in a few years your gonna need a 3 foot long card with your 30 digit number."
151946,Terry,2008-01-18 16:58:00,14456,see  see this is the crazy thing about the MNR that bugs the heck out of me  they are never on the same page  they should all now whats what and communicate with each other enough to interpret the regs the same way  if they can't clearly understand what is going on..how the hell can we
151670,Terry,2008-01-17 14:32:00,14456,"yeah, I think it is just written wrong, but what if they decide to fine you not warn you..$150.00 isn't cheap in my world, so I don't want the fine  and I am not sure about huts but with boats the numbers on a piece of paper will not cut it they need to be a certain size and permanent in nature and fastened in a permanent way to be legal ...I don't know but I can see huts having somewhat the same law.....and I can see them not excepting a piece of paper and tape holding it to any fish hut on the ice......  but you are right it may not be a big deal but if we don't approach them with the attitude that it's a big deal, they will not respond and the best end to this is they rescind the law"
151674,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-17 14:44:00,1362,"This is very strange....I just received a call (today at 09:30) from the North Bay MNR Enforcement Supervisor who was returning my message I left regarding this Fish hut Registry issue yesterday...  He informed me that portable huts (he used the example of ""Clams"") that are out for day outings only, do NOT need to be registered..  The reg states: You do not need to register an ice hut if it is a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric that has a base area of two square metres (21.5 square feet) or less when erected.  This reg is more for the individuals that set-up tents (canvas, plastic..etc..) and leave them out on the ice for extended periods.  I'm in total argeeance with this reg. We have had repeated issues year after year with having to go out on the ice here on the Ottawa R. after the season closes and drag back other anglers remains of makeshift tents made from 2x2s and vapor barrier and even big tarps that they left to rot on the ice!!"
151676,Terry,2008-01-17 14:51:00,14456,"yes the same regs has been posted here about 10 times ,but in no way supports what you are stating  and ""This reg is more for the individuals that set-up tents (canvas, plastic..etc..) and leave them out on the ice for extended periods."" says you, not the regs..I agree  that is what it should be but the regs do not state it  and if you read all the post you will see that we have had  many other MNR officials give different answers so it is still up in the air..we need it in writing to protect our selves from COs that don't know"
151678,Fish Farmer,2008-01-17 14:53:00,2234,"Terry, well said.  Brought this up last night to a few buds. One of the guys said the word portable is not there. Push comes to shove, he says it's a portable FISH HUT not a ice hut.  They say there is no ignorance in the law.  I hope he's right."
151682,wallyboss,2008-01-17 14:59:00,1095,TMH  you should have asked him send you an e-mail and then you could've posted his response. Becasue I would print it up and carry it on me when out fishing and if they want to give me a ticket I will see them in court!
151683,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-17 15:01:00,1362,I called the North Bay MNR office again and asked for a reply back in writing via mail and e-mail...I will post it as soon as it arrives!!
151684,Terry,2008-01-17 15:01:00,14456,"I have asked for a written reply and I will post it so we can carry it  I still believe that this is just an over sight but till all the COs know it, I don't want a fine"
151686,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-17 15:04:00,1362, Great minds think alike
151487,huntervasili,2008-01-16 22:58:00,1604,"Well I used your link Terry and sent em an E-mail and would think any of us who ice fish whether or not with a portable should do the same... If ya let the Gov't or Ministry push too much the will keep going, and eventually affect you whether or not you see it now... soon it will be special licenses for vehicles including cars, and Ice fishing licenses. Lets all speak up OFC has a voice lets show the Ministry.  Heres my message:  Hello there, and good day to you. I am writing about registering fish huts in zones 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The new registration rules seem to be somewhat ignorant as even portable collapsible huts must be registered. I enjoy frequenting many lakes and want to understand how it is reasonable to ask those of us who have portables, not much over regulation size (being 21.5 sq. feet), are supposed to go about fishing the many lakes we are fortunate enough to have in Ontario without making our huts covered in 2.5"" lettering specifically on cloth, where stickers or paint are not an option and the numbering would cost near or over $100 per license number. Hopefully this was some sort of oversight, which is clearly in need of re-evaluation. I appreciate any response.  Bill Parker"
