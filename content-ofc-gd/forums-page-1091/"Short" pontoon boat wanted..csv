I have seen them before and was wondering if anyone has experience with them and/or suggest a manufacturer of one.  Parents are looking for a ""knee-friendly"" means of transport.  TIA"

154901,gforce,2008-01-28 21:00:00,63,How much?
154906,danbo,2008-01-28 21:08:00,2646,free to good home!
154908,irishfield,2008-01-28 21:12:00,26272,They really are a great way to extend time on the water as mobility gets less and less. Walk off the dock to the same height boat deck. I'll be there in no time! Temagami Marine had a little tiny one in the sales storage area when I left in the fall. Will check for you to see if it's still available.

Take the wife and the dog out to some quiet cove or bay on the pontoon, anchor the pontoon and go out in my Tinny; fish, go back and relax. Or maybe just leave them there.      To think, 12 years ago I wouldn't have dreamed that a pontoon would sound kinda nice."
