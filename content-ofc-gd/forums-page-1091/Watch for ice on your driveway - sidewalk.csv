155241,Greencoachdog,2008-01-29 13:29:00,8163,Thanks for the heads up Lew... I'll keep an eye out!
155247,motv8tr,2008-01-29 13:47:00,2587,"Thanks Lew, does Marv have ice pics for his paws   No freezing rain up here, just rain...clearing off the roof for me  maureen"
155250,wuchikubo,2008-01-29 13:51:00,1114,"I agree Lew, I almost wiped out beside the garage this morning carrying things to put in to the vehicle. Threw a little alaskan melter on the spots and it was okay for the rest of the family to head out to school this morning.  Stan"
155314,irishfield,2008-01-29 16:04:00,26272,"Yep... as Maureen points out it just rained up here and rained HARD it did. Gonna be some collapsed roofs in the area for sure with over three feet of snow compacted into 18"" and soaking wet."
155316,wuchikubo,2008-01-29 16:13:00,1114,"Maureen and Wayne, you folks be careful up your way then!  Let's not hear about any accidents from you."
155317,irishfield,2008-01-29 16:18:00,26272,No problems Stan... it's gonna be when the flash freeze comes that it's gonna get interesting. Thank God I shovelled the wings off the three airplanes out in the tie downs yesterday... when I saw it was starting to look like good iglo building snow. Estimate I took about 5000 lbs of snow off each airplane and I think today they would have collapsed with the added moisture content.
155475,Rich Clemens,2008-01-29 22:25:00,3131,We had a thin layer of ice on the walks down here too.  Nice and click.   Got out there early and threw some salt down before the wife came out.   It didn't last long ... rain showers now.    Calling for falling temps overnight and high winds tomorrow.   About 38F on the way home from work a little while ago.

155484,Rich Clemens,2008-01-29 22:39:00,3131,"My uncle works for the US postal service and just slipped on some black ice about 1 week ago.   Result:  Two broken ribs, punctured lung, and a broken collar bone.    He was is the hospital a couple days, until his lung healed up.   Good news is that there is no need for surgery to correct the breaks.  Now just sit back and wait for everything to heal up again."
