I have heard too many stories of people purposely breaking a rod after a few years in order to get a new one. I myself have broken several rods ( car doors, windows, trying to seperate stuck joints etc.), never on a hookset, and I almost feel guilty sending it in when it had nothing to do with manufacturers quality. This unconditional warranty thing does nothing but drive up the cost of new rods. Those that take care of their equipment are the ones subsidizing  those, like me on occasion, who are not as careful. Seems to me, if you break a rod thru carelessness, you ought to pay for that carelessness. As for lifetime itself.....how ridiculous.....I say 5 years, and prorated after one year."
