153935,bassman,2008-01-24 21:48:00,384,"How about a couple of free passes for an OFNer?  Also, when you guys do the free seminars at the ""run of the mill Sportsmen's Shows seminars"" are you not bringing your ""A"" material?"
153949,Mark Kulik,2008-01-24 23:00:00,348,"I believe I can answer this one Bassman, when we talk at shows with general admission, a lot of the people are beginning or recreational anglers, getting too in-depth can be overwelming, I think I can speak for all the basstalk speakers -we basically put our heart into Every talk, however, the Basstalk series just gets more detailed, and with the aid of power point we can use personal illistrations to aid our audience, not to mention the open forum at the end , all questions go! I personally take every seminar seriously, I feel if people are willing to listen, then I have the responsibility to put as much into it as I can! to tell you the truth, I intently listen to other speakers as I always try to learn as much as I can! Hope to see you there. Mark Kulik"
153966,bassman,2008-01-24 23:43:00,384,How about some free passes Mr Kulik?
153995,Mark Kulik,2008-01-25 00:49:00,348,"I would love to if I had the authority, Bassman-might make for a good contest-will speak to Dave, I spoke at 2 last year-the year before I Paid to attend the Hamilton one, I learnt lots! I went on to have an awesome season including winning the CFT team of the year-coincidence, maybe, but I know that knowledge is power, the more you can posses the greater your success!"
153996,Roy,2008-01-25 00:52:00,13728,Good answer Mark. Most people who know you guys would pay the entry fee no problem.
153997,bassman,2008-01-25 01:21:00,384,"Are you guys raising money for a charitable cause this year? I thought you did that last year.  BTW, great show Mark!"
154027,Mark Kulik,2008-01-25 02:23:00,348,"Yes Bassman we have a silent auctionfor some cool stuff, which goes to Big Brothers and Sisters and Casting for a Cure which hits close for me as my Mom is losing her battle with cancer, and thank-you for the show Kudo's, we really appreciate it! we have a great season comming up in a couple of weeks, and I think that you  will like it."
154044,David Chong,2008-01-25 03:20:00,836,"Thanks Mark, Great reply! We do spend a great deal of time on these presentations, in fact I'm still working and tweaking mine right now! We keep the topic at the Bass Talk seminar sessions very specific and detailed. Many past attendees have told us that it's the best $75.00 they've ever spent on fishing. We are very proud of the fact that we have raised close to $10,000.00 for Dave Mercer's ""Casting For A Cure!"" and the ""Catch A Dream!"" Kids Derby over the last couple of years! Mark, you know that Dana's and my thoughts are with you and your family at this trying time! I look forward to seeing you tomorrow! Dave"
