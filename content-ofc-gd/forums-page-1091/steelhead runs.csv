155471,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 22:09:00,7971,"After rains or melt from snow/ice, and while the waters are still elevated.   That triggers them running up rivers and creeks.  Numbers are not as great now as they were in the fall or spring, but some come up all winter long.  You'll have to time it right and alter your bait depending on water clarity."
