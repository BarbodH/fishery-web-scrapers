154972,Rizzo,2008-01-29 00:28:00,4754,I see some big ponds on either side of the road out highway 90 between Barrie and Angus.  Anyone know if there is any fish in them?
154975,Fisherman,2008-01-29 00:35:00,7201,"No fish, just gravel pits, although there are some whales in there in the summer."
154977,Rizzo,2008-01-29 00:40:00,4754,hahaha I have seen some people over there before...wasn't too pretty.  does that mean they are quite deep? They actually look pretty shallow and flat.  Would be a shame if a bass or two found their way in there  :rolleyes:
154983,Meegs,2008-01-29 00:53:00,249,"There's Pike in the one on the right if your heading from barrie to angus.   Nothing huge, but still some decent numbers! great place to trap some minnows !"
