You can see the bone handle of a knife on my right hip, and I've still got it and it still travels with me on all my camping trips.  Not bad for 50 years eh ??  "

153051,Burtess,2008-01-22 13:16:00,901,Gotta be the Benchmade Outbounder.  Holds a great edge and fits my hand well.  http://www.benchmade.com/products/product_....aspx?model=180  I had a Kydex sheath made for it as the leather one was a bit cumbersome.  Burt
153089,1northerner,2008-01-22 14:59:00,17, For just around the camp I like to use my Gerber... looks like the pic but mines silver...  but for walking around the woods I like to use the big knife my surrogate dad gave me before he died when I was 16.  That one's got to be 7 inches long.. black handle... old and not very stylish but it's still sharp and solid.
153103,Garyv,2008-01-22 15:32:00,547,I may have a bigger one somewhere with me but this is all I carry in the boat.  Done it for 15+ years with no problems.
