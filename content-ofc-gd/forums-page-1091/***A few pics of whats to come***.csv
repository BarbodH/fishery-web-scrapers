154938,Ryan Landry,2008-01-28 23:00:00,128,"No problem, I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like a good deal (myself included).  It's all good!  Ryan"
155050,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 02:01:00,7971,Hey Ryan...cant wait to give them a try!  Very excited for spring now!!!

154654,danc,2008-01-27 23:12:00,4677,Very nice Ryan. The Protege is my fav..
154655,Ramble,2008-01-27 23:13:00,713,I know just the place to use that pop-hopper...it's size and taper look deadly for smallmouth. Is that K-9 a topwater?
154657,Greencoachdog,2008-01-27 23:18:00,8163,Some good lookin' baits there! I really like the Pink Eyed Ghost and Pink/Black tiger color patterns!
154659,irishfield,2008-01-27 23:26:00,26272,Some great looking stuff there Ryan and an arm and a leg in tooling costs to boot !
154661,woodro,2008-01-27 23:29:00,168,"sweet looking baits, what price range are they in? My fav is the K-9"

154666,medmart,2008-01-27 23:46:00,587,Great looking baits Ryan i personally like the protege  rob
154676,brickNblock,2008-01-28 00:43:00,598,"Ryan.......some nice looking lures there Bud......(& partners). I got to say this as well,.............Nice touch of class......

Mo does and done an exellent job for this family and how can we not but co-operate with that. WTG man.........WTG.  Living on a waterbody that holds smallies in some abundance We've got most of the top waters by way of style that you have shown with one diffeence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, They werent made yby ou fellars and.............the monies didnt go to as great a cause so I have to have a few.....................them topwaters look SA-WEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeer! Exellent Gesture Bud...............exellent! I had read that someone had something similar but............. It just isnt the same.........Regardless.  Dont know if we can make the tourney this year or not....(Dont tell Maureen) but if it is available to purchase some of those exelent lookng topwaters.......I'm in for sure. The Popper with the Orange/Red with Green (perch,walleye) under belly is truly a decent looking bait and I'd love to have one. We'll be in touch Bud...................We'll be in touch. WTG on the FishingForTyler Event.......AWESOME. pete"
154695,Ryan Landry,2008-01-28 01:42:00,128,"First off I would like to say that there are many lure companies out there, and sure there will be similar and even exact same lures out there in terms of shape/style.  But you can't forget about an equally important aspect wich is quality. Quality of the plastic, paint, clearcoat, hooks, assembly, ect.  My partner Devon and I are huge fans of Rapalas (they catch fish) and in my opinion are very well built lures of high quality. We own hundreds of them each.  I give you my word that our lures are up there with some of your favorite brands.  As for the price range the 12 types listed here will start at $5.49 - $6.99 there will also 5 more types in that price range.  Thanks everyone for your feedback!"
154698,huntervasili,2008-01-28 01:50:00,1604,Awesome looking lures and great gesture... Glad to hear they are affordable too... guess ya were trying to hit right under many competitors prices... looks like an excellent product to me. K-9 will definately be on my list of to-buy lures... are you going to be in stores or  off the net only?
154715,Ryan Landry,2008-01-28 02:39:00,128,"We will sell from our website until we feel our products are eaisly accessible to everyone. But our main objective is to get them in stores.  Since the K-9 seems to be popular here are 3 more colors.  This is a topwater bait, that will ""walk the dog"" almost effortlessly. It's 4'' long.      Thanks,  Ryan"
154729,huntervasili,2008-01-28 03:24:00,1604,Hey Ryan do the K-9's have rattles in them? If not do you plan to add that to them? Liking the last colour... can almost feel a big toad eatin' it now
154730,Ryan Landry,2008-01-28 03:27:00,128,"Yes they do, most of our lures have rattles in them.  a few more of the Protege.   "
154735,Badger Shark,2008-01-28 03:56:00,291,It would be cool if you make a deep diver in the red counter strike model.  There are similar lures out there but quality and price is always the bottom line and you look like you have a good thing going there.
154737,huntervasili,2008-01-28 04:10:00,1604,Can't agree more Badger Shark. They could definitely make good BOQ eye lures... Really cool colours you have too!
154785,b2kptbo,2008-01-28 12:56:00,1505,Good stuff Ryan...
154799,fishinggeek,2008-01-28 14:25:00,325,"drwxr, which Dollarama store has those?  Can't beat 99 cents a lure!"
154820,drwxr,2008-01-28 15:47:00,453,moved
154897,huntervasili,2008-01-28 20:43:00,1604,"Guys... This thread is not meant to see dollarama baits... Ryan began the thread to show us his great looking new product, I figure you might as well respect him and keep your clutter out of here... nothing wrong with the content just maybe start a new thread or PM each other... Please take no offense, I am just putting myself in his position... And BTW you going to bring some of those lures to the fishing for Tyler G2G, Ryan?"
154898,Terry,2008-01-28 20:57:00,14456,I must agree people should not be posting about dollar store lures on a thread like this...   real nice looking stuff there Ryan...most of us understand the difference in workmanship
154907,bassmaster4,2008-01-28 21:11:00,801,that stinger looks awesome for bass in that hot pink pattern
154911,fishinggeek,2008-01-28 21:23:00,325,"Sorry if I offended anyone, especially Ryan.  OFC seems to be a really good forum for deals, and I just really get excited over good deals!  But I agree the colours sure look catchy Ryan.  Keep 'em comin'!"
154917,tonyb,2008-01-28 21:37:00,1637,"Ryan, those are some great looking lures! and some interesting colour schemes that I haven't seen before either.  I'll be looking forward to visiting your site when it comes online.  2 questions for ya...  1.  What hooks are on the baits?  My common complaint with most crankbaits is that the hooks typically need to be replaced right out of the package.  Some companies are catching on, and I think it's a step in the right direction.  2.  Will we be able to purchase these lures from your website?  I have to agree with bricknblock, a classy gesture of you to get your lures into the hands of some quality anglers at the Tyler event.  Tony"
154930,Ryan Landry,2008-01-28 22:41:00,128,"Tony,  The hooks on the lures are manufactured in the same facility as the lures are. In my opinion they are pretty good hooks, they are very sharp. With that being said, there are better hooks on the market but they cost more $$$. I think a large percentage of people will be happy with them right out of the box.  We will sell from our website until we feel our products are eaisly accessible to everyone through local fishing shops.  We are also doing the Halifax sportsman show in march and working on getting our lures in the Toronto show aswell.  We also have many other types of lures to come such as:  Freshwater  -spinners -spoons -swimbaits -musky lures -termenal tackle (steel leaders ect.) -and a line of tungsten products (split shots, jigheads ect.) -ice fishing jigs  Saltwater  -Mackeral/cod jigs -squid jigs -sabiki rigs -Tuna lures  Thanks,  Ryan"
