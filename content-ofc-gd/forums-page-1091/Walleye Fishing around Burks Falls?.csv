154546,Casey123,2008-01-27 17:07:00,461,"Another member helped me out so I will do the same  Restoule Lake is a good place to start.  Go to angler atlas and get the map.  Find the 20 foot hump by the islands, late afternoon, off the hump in 25 to30 FOW. Oh yeah, sledding - 10 minutes from the park gate, walking 1 hour.  We walked, nice time|!!!!"
154586,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-27 18:39:00,2585,"take a look at a map and pretty well pick a lake.  most lakes in that area are part of the magnetawan river.  and lakes that are part of it all have walleye in them.  Sand, horn, bartlett, deer, ahmic, cecebe, 3 mile etc etc.... all have walleye.  good luck.  Cheers!"
154622,fishless,2008-01-27 21:39:00,82,hi not all lakes have walleye sand lake does not have them.jamie
154628,fishindevil,2008-01-27 22:00:00,6254,"Hey fishless, SAND  LAKE DOES HAVE WALLEYES !!!!! and thats the lake i would be fishing first...good-luck cecebe as well,they are not usually big but you will get some nice 16,19 inchers....great for the frying pan !!!!"
154796,mikemcmillan,2008-01-28 14:08:00,50,"Cecebe has some nice walleye, one of my guests caught a 9 pounder just after thanksgiving weekend. You can park and walk out from Rockwynn Landing on hwy 520. Out around the islands is a good place to start. There are some huts out there now so you can see where guys are fishing.  Good luck if you try.  Mike"
154804,fishless,2008-01-28 14:50:00,82,hey fishindevil in all the years i have fished that lake myself and everybody else has never caught an eye.i think we should be talking about the same lake.the one you speak of where is it.the sand lake that i speak of is on 518 east past kearney are you thinking the same lake?
154807,Flappn,2008-01-28 15:13:00,245,I have been on Sand Lake for 12 years. I have never caught or seen any one come out with a walleye. Doe Lake and Lake Cecebe do have Walleye though.
