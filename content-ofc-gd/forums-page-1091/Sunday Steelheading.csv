The creek was free of ice, but the water level was low considering that the mouth was wide open.  Apart from one other angler, I had some feathered company.    Using a yellow and orange lure of my Dad's creation (it's called the ""Cheese Omelette"" pattern) I made a half-dozen casts when I got a strike. The fight was about five minutes long and pretty enjoyable, especially since I hadn't caught a steelhead for about a month.    Once I snapped the one quick photo, the fish was released none the worse for wear. Didn't take any effort to revive -- took off like a flash.  With more warm weather for this week, I anticipate some good steelheading if the runoff doesn't muddy up the picture too much.  Eric"

154949,elee886,2008-01-28 23:17:00,9, I have to admit that it's not my first colour choice for a sunny day -- that would be black with orange spots. It just goes to show: always listen to your old man.  Eric
