This was my third trip to Scugog this year, and so far, i've got 1 perch, 1 walleye, and 3 largemouths... 2 of which were 2Lbs.  So, anyways, last night i decided that i wanted to do some fishing, and i decided to go to Scugog again, becuase my buddy has a cottage there, and he was up for the weekend. although he never actually came out fishing with me, him and his buddy were out on a snowmobile trek.  the day started off with me crawling my sorry @ss out of bed around noon sunday, had some leftovers from dinner last night (chicken and steak), GREAT start to the day! Left the house around 1:00 and with a short stop at the Causeway baitshop, i was fishing by about 2:30ish. It took about a half hour to get my first bite, a respectable 9"" perch... and within the next hour and a half i had 5 perch (all the same size) on the ice. the next 30 minutes were really slow, and i didn't even get a bite.  so, i changed my lure from a jigging rap to my new swedish pimple. stuck a minnow on that, dropped it down the hole, BAM, 11"" perch on the ice... i thought i was on Simcoe for a second. re-baited the pimple, dropped it down the hole, BAM, WOW, this fish has some weight! It starts taking some drag, the next thing i know, my tip-up rod is almost down the hole, which was about 10 feet away... of course it was the fish that i was fighting that wrapped itself up with my other line. i managed to get over to the other line and release the bail on the reel. and after a great 5 minute battle i landed this monster...  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/gone...pg?t=1201497948  This is all i could fit into the picture, my camera was a full arms length away from me.  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/gone...pg?t=1201497972  I couldn't believe the size of the thing when its head popped through the hole. it was 20 inches and between 4 and 5 Lbs. back she goes into the drink. another 10 minutes of fishing...  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/gone...pg?t=1201497994  1.5-2Lb Largemouth, again, back she goes.  By this time the sun starts to go down, but before it could i end up with a nice walleye, about 19"" and a couple crappie both around 9 or 10 inches. the rest of the night i had a pretty steady crappie bite until about 6:30. most of the crappies were about 10"", with one being 11"", and one being 12"".  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b75/gone...pg?t=1201498016  i also ended up with another largemouth and a small rock bass before the night was done."

154763,Blake,2008-01-28 12:01:00,418,Great report and good fishing for Scugog
154801,tonyb,2008-01-28 14:37:00,1637,"Wow those are some excellent Green Pickerel!  Was there yesterday morning  with my brother and he managed 1 eye was well with a couple of panfish in the mix.  We were on the water fishing by 7am and off the water at 10:00am then off to Simcoe for a Perch feed out of Virginia Beach.  The walleye bite has drastically died-off since before the big melt a couple weeks ago on Scugog.  I think the pressure has diminished the #'s on the lake.  You figure about 100 people per day and everyone was limiting out early on so that is !1200 fish/day!  I'm not sure how productive the lake is but I don't think too many walleye populations can handle that type of pressure for too long.  The first time I was there is was non-stop action with the walleye, even double-headers, not anymore.  Tony"

154822,cork soaker,2008-01-28 15:59:00,23,"tonyb  that could be because you fished the morning.scugog is traditionally an evening fishery.  it is extremely productive,  but yes, fishing can die off a bit, just like anywhere."
155128,gone_fishin,2008-01-29 03:43:00,481,"Scugog is generally better late afternoon and into dark. i've never caught anything more than a few perch in the morning. unless we're fishing in the summer, and that's another story all together."
