8736,nautifish,2006-12-06 02:29:00,1416,"Well the house wwas on the news today....$150,000 worth of damage they are still investigateing.  I must have got their after the worst had happened.   Was their this evening outside and the smell of smoke is really strong even stood outside the home. The windows are all blown out and whats left of them are black....They are saying it started from the basement........THAT HOUSE HAS BEEN THEIR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.  When we renovated the kitchen two yrs ago we found newspaper lined on the plaster & lath dated 1816.  The attic was lined with old newspaper dated from early 1909.....and up on to the mid to late  thirties.  One paper had a full center spread page of the quintruplets all dressed in toronto maple leafs uniform from way back when..and they are probably around six months old....I do not know much about hockey......But the center spread is all in colour and still looks like it was just published yesterday.  We kept everything and have it stored away.  Will be a real shame if they have to knock that house down.....Been their along time  long before  Capt'billys or the arbour and i had alot of good,happy memories their."
8741,Rich,2006-12-06 02:32:00,3927,"Wow that house was in my friend's family for over 50 years, that really is a shame."
8745,nautifish,2006-12-06 02:38:00,1416,"Yeah i know rich i am feeling kinda sickened by it actually.......Not my house anymore...i know...But ya kinda hope that the next person will love it and take care of it as you did.....Not that it was anyones fault.....  but it really is sad...  All the fish frys and parties we had their.....Recently my birthday party which was great ran my business from there , All the memories renovating...Man and all the money i put into that home too.........lol  Trust me if they end up knocking that house down i will be pretty upset......"
