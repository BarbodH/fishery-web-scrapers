7557,Greencoachdog,2006-12-02 01:03:00,8163,"   That is a very good question Express 168, and I was wondering about that myself... maybe Specktacklure would care to elaborate?"
7558,irishfield,2006-12-02 01:15:00,26272,$40 fuel burn vs $135 Not in your dreams from the most fuel efficient injected engine ever built to the most miserably tuned/carburated POS ....when installed on the same boat. There is not a huge %age difference in lbs fuel burn/Hp in a combustion engine from WWII technology to present day fuel injection. Different boats..different burns. 2 strokes historically burned twice as much fuel as 4 strokes as they sucked fuel both on compression and exhaust strokes for cooling and their simple design. Todays fuel injected 2 strokes now of course shoot it in on the compression stroke only and why they are competing with the fuel burn of 4 strokes. But the $40 to $135 fuel burn comparision is...I'll be nice...specks opinion. Had same engine in a 26' fiberform that would take $150 to get to Honey harbour and back from Midland and a 26' Tempest that would make it to Manitoulin on the same fuel. All depends on how the boat rides or pushes water.  Everyone has their favouries and opinions no different than Ford/Chevy/Dodge/Toyota. No need to insult those that have chosen a different manufacturer than your favourite...   Exactly Express...you'd have to be leaking or neglectful as very minimal is going out as blow by in the exhaust. Compared to a 2 stroke that is using oil in the fuel mix and like my 2003 115 Johnson (Everrude/Bombardia(sp)) that spits oil out the exhaust into the lake while idling
7559,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 01:18:00,3421,well said Wayne .this was a question asking about 2 different technolgies.Not brand preference and name calling.
7563,Jigatollah,2006-12-02 01:50:00,53," The circuits in the US will have a motor company as a sponsor and the majority of anglers who fish that particular circuit will be running those motors. If you look up here in Ontario, the circuits are mostly Mercury sponsored and that reflects back with what the anglers use. It's more of a Merc showing here. Prefernce is mostly on what the consumer thinks as every company will push out a lemon once in a while. I prefer the Opti because of it's track record in reliability."
7564,Spiel,2006-12-02 01:51:00,9065,"....I also ballked at the etec when I discovered the price of their oil is about $50 per gallon (and I've been an Evinrude/Johnson man all my life). Which for my boat added roughly $15-$20 more for every tank of fuel. I was also told that not using their oil would invalidate the warranty. And yes my 4 stroke oil is self contained, it's not in the lake.  As for hole shots, well my 17', 91.5"" beam gets on plane in about 2-3 seconds.  Seems pretty good to me."
7566,Terry,2006-12-02 01:52:00,14456,you are right Wayne
7569,irishfield,2006-12-02 02:00:00,26272,"I'd just finished a PM and stated exactly the same.... why all the ""sponsored"" guys are running Evinrudes in the US is because it's easier to get their sponsorship/cheap deals/ to try and sell their engines to the general public based on preception. ""Pros"" run the sheeet out of their engines and don't care about longevity...as they are someone elses problem next year."
7571,ecmilley,2006-12-02 02:06:00,2163,"hmm brp can't seem to keep the engines in the ski-doos from coming apart, how they managed that with the e-tec engine? pretty much identicle technology. as for all the arguements, it won't be to many more years untill its all 4-stroke anyways maintenance costs will be similar and you won't be buying 50 a gallon synthetic 2 stroke oil. both engines have there advantages, 2 strokes seem to get out of the hole better and will have better top end, part throttle cruising will be to the advantage of 4 stroke engines,remeber 2 strokes have a 400 rpm power band while 4 strokes around 3000 rpm (the diiference between max torque and horspower). Generally for a bass boat i would select a 2 stroke, just because you are usually running and gunning. If I were going to but an outboard 2 stroke it would be a yammy with hdpi , most reliable and usually best resale."
7595,bigfish1965,2006-12-02 03:17:00,3382,"I think the ski doo is a rotax engine isn't it? Nothing like the E-Tec. Anyway..if you can give up the weight, go with a 4 stroke, but if you can't, go with a 2. My boat couldn't afford the weight difference, so I went with a 2 stroke. I would have loved to get an e-Tec, but the 25's weren't available yet. Any brand new 4 stroke and brand new 2 stroke with have similar efficiencies. Two stroke will always have a better whole shot by the nature of their firing twice as often as the 4 stroke. What I really want is for Mazda to make a rotory boat motor. 8,000 RPM's baby."
7604,Greencoachdog,2006-12-02 03:36:00,8163," ... but you wouldn't want to feed that thing Rick (10mpg). A friend of mine had a rotary RX7, said he loved the performance... but hated the fuel consumption."
7914,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 06:02:00,3421,Ok hookset after all these opinions let us know what you purchase.Pay now or pay later!
7928,Fish Farmer,2006-12-03 13:43:00,2234,"It will work out in the end, resale. You'll get more for a 4 stroke package. It's going to be 4 strokes in the long run. But I have a few friends that have an Etec and there very happy, as for the oil price for them it is expensive, but you don't use as much as the old 2 stroke tec."
8282,Hookset,2006-12-04 21:43:00,367,"Hey Guys thanks very much for all the input. As usual the members on here blew me away. As for what I want for power it's gotta be a Merc. For one it's a package so I have to pick a Merc, but it was a Merc that I want to run anyway. I know that E-Tecs are reportedly good motors but I still have issues with O.M.C. from previous motors I have owned and I just don't have faith in them even though they are Bombardier now. On the package that I want to buy I get a ""power back saving"" if I run an Optimax. To run a 4 stroke is close to $3 grand more. If the price was closer it would be 4 stroke but it looks like a shakey old 2 stroke is what I'm gonna run. But as I type this I gotta admit A 4 stroke sure would be sweet. In other words I don't have a clue. Yet....  Thanks again for all the help,  Hookset."
8287,irishfield,2006-12-04 21:55:00,26272,Leave the LCX110C off for now and go 4 stroke ! LOL  Like I said early $3000 +/- was the difference to go Verado on any of the Lunds I had quoted compared to the Optimax. Different Merc Smart gauges etc all taken into consideration.  Tough choices and nobody can make the final call but yourself.  Good luck with 'er.
8291,Fang,2006-12-04 22:10:00,1330,$3000 more for a 115 4 stroke  How much $ for a 135 Optimax or even 150  Spend the extra on horsepower man!!!! (grinning from ear to ear)  Doesn't that Nitro take up to a 150  Thats 40-45MPH to 55MPH upgrade. Go with speed  I wish I had been able to max out the HP on my crestliner but it was a new to me and came with the 115.
8294,irishfield,2006-12-04 22:16:00,26272,With Paul now reminding me of HP...$3000+/- was the difference when talking 225 and 250 engines. Don't think there should be that much spread on a 115.
8298,NBR,2006-12-04 22:27:00,163,Based on the size of your boat I would guess it is rated for 150HP or more. I'd go with a 150 Optimax. You will run at lower rpm at the same speed and use less fuel. In the boat reviews I have read the new generation 2 strokes are darn near as fuel efficient as the 4 strokes plus you have the advantage of lighter weight to push and the reliability of many years of improvements in the 2 strokes.  In a big motor used mainly for speed I wouldn't even think of a 4 stroke. A 75 hp or less would be a different issue.
8495,Gerry,2006-12-05 16:12:00,257,"""a shakey old 2 stroke ""  You won't see that on an Optimax Hookset, they are as smooth as a 4 stroke. As to fuel efficiency, several mags have run tests that show quite clearly that the new DFI's are as efficient or even better than 4 strokes. Frankly, I see no benefit to owing a 4 stroke in this HP range.  As to statement that 2 strokes will disappear and that all outboards will be 4 strokes ..... ain't gonna happen in my lifetime. Old carburated 2 strokes, yes I'll agree, but that won't happen with the DFIs' because they are as clean. If memory serves me correctly (there' no guaranty on that), I recall reading an artcile in Bass and Walleye Boats magazine that claimed the DFIs' are cleaner than the 4 strokes; I think it was because the DFI's have a more complete fuel burn, if that makes any sense. I'll try to dig it up.  A few guys have the Verados on the bass circuit ( a supercharged 4 stroke) and they all report that are less fuel efficient than the Optis' at WOT."
8499,Hookset,2006-12-05 16:24:00,367,"""Shakey"" old 2 stroke was just a humerous response to an earlier post. The Optimax has been at the top of my list since I started looking at new boats. All your points on the Opti were bang on. The 4 stroke would have needed to be far superior for me to choose it. As for the difference in price of 3 grand that I stated, it is accurate due to the ""power up"" savings that were offered on the Optimax. Basically it works out to the same price as a 90 Opti. I'm choosing the 115 hp because it allows me to fish in certain circuits that are limited to 115 hp. And at around 50 mph I would be happy and not too far outclassed on the bigger circuits.  Thanks again.  Hookset."
7443,Fang,2006-12-01 20:59:00,1330,"Hookset  Ran last summer beside 2 other 17-18 ft aluminums Lund and Princecraft.  my 2 stroke just edged out a 4 stroke yamaha (Lund) but we both got left behind by the optimax (Princecraft) off the line and 2-3 miles down the lake.  I was impressed  OPtimax 115 is 375 lbs only - 4 stroke is 399lbs no biggy  One spec I saw  was the Optimax has a built in 60 amp altenator pushing 756 watts. Nice for keeping the battery topped up. Lights, livewell, sonar all day. I've run the battery dead once before. Not fun.  The 4 stroke is ony 50amp/630 watt"
7447,specktacklure,2006-12-01 21:15:00,56,wouldn't touch either.Evinrude etec is by far the best motor on the market ! 150 hp merc 4stroke 562lbs 150 etec 427 lbs come on now.Etec has a safety feature with the oil intake that allows the engine to run without oil for 7 hours .Emission tested until 2008.Better hole shot faster to plane.Quite as a mouse you won't even know it is running.Can't say i ever remember seeing a Merc not smoke.You poor people who think a merc is better than an evinrude .The only reason mercury does so well is that they own 90% of the boat lines now so of corse you are going to see more mercs because most boat lines are pre rigged with them.Do your homework and you will see for yourself.Just trying to educate the public.My two mechanics (who are both bass pros) won't put anything but an evinrude etec on their boats.Just my opinion !
7456,Jigatollah,2006-12-01 21:47:00,53,"  Most boats aren't built to handle the extra weight of a 4 stroke of comparible HP. The problem lies when you shut the big engine down, the amout of back wash that will hit the boat. You can get around this a bit by giving some gas just as the back wash is about to hit, but you will feel the weight push down on the back of the boat. There are some boat manufacturers that are compensating for this now."
7461,irishfield,2006-12-01 22:11:00,26272,"That's what I thought on the low bass boats jig...not an issue in my boat choice with a 25"" transom and 53' mid ship..but could make or break some bass boats and something Hookset will need to consider."
7464,fishindevil,2006-12-01 22:32:00,6254,"wow...very interesting guys,i was checking and even on WFN..all the wal-mart,guys and all the big pros all use evenrude outboards. and the stats do stack -up i think that the evenrude is a better engine.....but there doesnt seem to be any around here i never see them at all and i do alot of hours...how come they are not around,where would you get them serviced ????lots of pros & cons   for sure......"
7502,Mike the Pike,2006-12-01 23:25:00,3421,"Depends on what you do with your boat.Some folks fish and Ski,tubbing wakeboards.The 2 stroke is great for pulling people out of the hole when waterskiing.Do you really need the quicker lift to get from point A to Point B for fishing........NOT.I have a 50 fourstroke Honda my last boat had a 2 stroke.I will never go back.I have had  my four stroke for 3 seasons and still have the same plugs.Ever try and talk to someone when your wide open with a 2 stroke forget it.don't know what song is playing on the stereo.Yes I agree a large 2 stroke will troll slower but it shakes alot.Anything loose in the boat tends to give an annoying rattle.My cousin has an optimax 115 and he prefers to troll with his 9.9 Merc.4 stroke .He does go through more than one set of spark plugs per season.When the plugs need to be changed the boat looses performance and the motor can start Jerking when full throttle.  go for the eviroment friendly 4 stroke.  Gonna be tough for you to decide."
7528,specktacklure,2006-12-02 00:00:00,56,"one more thing about the etec no scheduled 20hr inspection.3yrs before you have to bring in for maintenance ,no break in time put in water and go .As far as environmentally friendly your fooling yourself if you think a fourstroke is better.where do you think all the oil that isn't used go IN THE WATER.Maybe you missed the 2008 emition tested part.All the oil in the etec is used for power nothing left to drip into our beautiful lakes.Anybody who thinks a four stroke merc is better than an etec is doing a diservice to themselves as well as our river systems.there is no arguing this guys the facts are the facts.The verado is like an anchor on the back of your boat the thing weighs a tonne !!200 etec blows the Verado out of the water it really isn't even close .Use one compete against guys with the Verado and i always leave them in the dust no questions asked.Oh yeah and don't forget about fuel efficiency.Lets see my $40 to there $135 HHMMMM...... you do the math.Don't be fooled by the masses .Just my opinion"
7531,Fisherman,2006-12-02 00:04:00,7201,Maybe you should try selling freezers north of 60...
7538,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 00:18:00,3421,Well Wayne I think we won't be able to see your Verado on the new boat.You'll be smokin with that. So much HP you might be keepin up with the bass boats.this thread is starting to sound like the hockey poll.Mike  
7544,express168,2006-12-02 00:25:00,327,"Just a question, How would oil from a 4 stroke end up in the water if it is a circulated oil system like a car and not burned with the fuel like a 2 stroke? Unless you have an oil leak or somebody dumps their oil in the lake after they do an oil change."
7555,Mike the Pike,2006-12-02 00:54:00,3421,I just googled outboards 2 stroke vs 4 stroke.You will have plenty of articles to read.  One that caught my eye was.www.deepscience.com/articles.engines.html  Read and read and read and oh   Mike
