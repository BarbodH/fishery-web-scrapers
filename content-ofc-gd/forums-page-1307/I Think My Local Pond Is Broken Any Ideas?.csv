8567,aplumma,2006-12-05 19:24:00,6896,I was driving to my first call this morning and stopped by a little pond I fish. I noticed that it looked really calm with no rippling on it and when I cast a crankbait out it floated on top. I guess someone must of dumped something in their because the top of the water was all hard. I Called Glen in Alabananas to see if he had any ideas but he is stumped too.  Art
8569,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 19:30:00,7971,Hmmmm....sounds like an ecological disaster!!!  This has something to do with global warming or pollution!!! I just know it!!!
8571,Bly,2006-12-05 19:36:00,1556,"Funny you mention this, I think it might be a fairly wide spread problem.....I too noticed a local pond that wasn't right.....this one was all covered in white stuff????  I was afraid to venture near enough to examine it closely...sure hope someone can fix this......  blyght"
8576,Whopper,2006-12-05 19:47:00,2174,LOL Art  Get a heavier bait!  Whopper
8578,douG,2006-12-05 19:50:00,2693,"I think you should see if that crusty stuff on top of your pond tastes funny.  Give it a lick tomorrow morning and get back to us with your observations.  I for one am very curious how this taste test will work out.  Stick to it, Art, you'll get it figgered out."
8582,walleyejigger,2006-12-05 19:58:00,876," try walkin on it, that should be heavy enough,  maybe it's a mirage"
8632,tjsa,2006-12-05 22:25:00,1578," NO, NO, NO, Art, at this time of year the only body bait to toss out is the CIL Wobbler, lol. And, in the business Glen is in, he should have access to a good supply."
8633,snag,2006-12-05 22:28:00,1932, Always the scientist.  I bet it tastes like chocolate.

8868,aplumma,2006-12-06 13:51:00,6896,Funny thing I went out their today and it was soft again. I guess someone else came along and found it and was smart enough to fix it. Sure hope it does not break again to soon... I will keep your test in mind if it happens again DouG I can always trust and rely on  the advise of a socket rcienist.  Art
