7770,lew,2006-12-02 19:11:00,12767," Your right Chris, Jamies definetely the Dawg King when it comes to toothies, he even brought his talents with him when we fished the K-Lakes this summer"
7807,Crazyhook,2006-12-02 21:45:00,1154,LOL we caught two in the spot last week Chris!   that fish was on the legend perch bait...  thanks Lew!
8103,kennyman,2006-12-04 01:57:00,737,"Why is everything top secret????? Only a few guys actually say where or how they caught the fish. It'd be nice if people expanded on their story (at least when asked). I'm not looking for GPS coordinates. Maybe what lake or area and especially conditions,water clarity and what you used to catch them (equipment ,live bait or crankbait,spinner etc.). If it was lure,what type,colour,pattern etc. ? How's a guy supposed to learn? I'm not looking to steal ""your fish"", just learn how to catch my own."
