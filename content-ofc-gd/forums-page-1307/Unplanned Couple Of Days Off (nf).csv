8358,Fisherman,2006-12-05 01:36:00,7201,"Wayne, let us know what it is/was.  Not knowing what year Mo's car is, there are a couple other things, that could come into play.  Usually injector pumps on those don't go from one second to the next, they go bad slowly, fuel mileage going down,  lower power, etc."
8361,irishfield,2006-12-05 01:54:00,26272,Yep...I hear yah...no different than the one on my Zetor tractor. The one that dies instantly is the John Deer 410 hoe as it has electric input (on/off) and I sure hope that her mechanics first the glow plugs and now the pump weren't just a loose fuse that was mentioned previously....as no matter what at this point they'll be stickin her with the bill. They are letting it sit all night to be sure it starts cold in the am and then she's gonna call me for a ride again.
8375,Fisherman,2006-12-05 02:47:00,7201,"Ya, hopefully nothing expensive.  I know that after a couple hundred starts the fuse (looks like a piece of tin) would expand and shrink so many times, it would form a hairline crack, and finally on the colder days, no contact, but the relay would cycle like normal, lights and all go dim, but no power to the glowplugs."
8386,pameladallaire,2006-12-05 03:22:00,470,"Poor Maureen, I know how you feel, been there, done that.     Thank goodness we have a newer vehicle now.  As the saying goes, and this too will pass.  Keep us updated.  Pam"
8419,Carp,2006-12-05 10:27:00,1488,Sorry to hear about your recent bad luck Mo.  Get through it and keep going on with life. Time will heal the wounds.
8422,motv8tr,2006-12-05 10:50:00,2587,"Thanks for all the suggestions guys, it's appreciated.  As Wayne said the car has been worked on, and a fuel injector pump has already been replaced.  My mechanic tested the old one, and I trust him.  I've been taking my car to him for a few years now, and I've never been steered wrong.  The car is a 93 Golf, so no new fangled electronics getting messed up.  If I can help it I will not buy newer than that, if I do, it won't be a VW, I hear the newer ones are nothing but trouble.  Maureen"
8757,motv8tr,2006-12-06 02:57:00,2587,"Well thanks to Irishfields taxi service, I managed to pick up my car today, thanks again Wayne.  Turns out the fuel injector was leaking fuel as well so it's just as well it was replaced.  Drove down to innisfil this afternoon to see my brother and his family, and it feels like the power in the car has improved.  Hard to improve on the mileage, but I won't complain if it does  .  With any luck that will be it for a while, although in the new year I need to get a small oil leak fixed.  While he was at the car, my mechanic checked the timing belt and thankfully all is well, but I'll likely get that changed in the spring.  Maureen"
8772,fishdawg,2006-12-06 03:17:00,912,"tough go Mo (and Glen as well) neither of ya's are quitters though, good on ya  going through a fairly tough time myself with some things - but thats life  chin up everyone"
8865,brickNblock,2006-12-06 13:40:00,598,"Mo, sorry to hear about all these friggin' situations that entered your life. They always have the most inappropriate timing. Right now Im watching our account dwindle which holds the closing and moving costs for a new home as Charmaine requires a new vehicle. Its making me pull my hair out, she would have needed it eventually anyway but, Timing Suxx.!!!!!!!!! I just semi-retired this past November. Everything will work out for all, it always does. Good on ya Wayne for your assistance.......Exellent! Chin up Mo.....one step at a time!"
8885,Whopper,2006-12-06 14:21:00,2174,Glad to hear you got your car fixed Maureen!  Good on Wayne for helping out  Wayne has gone beyond the call of duty with his generosity and his helping hand this past year along with others OFC'ers.  Whopper
8224,Fisherman,2006-12-04 17:56:00,7201,"Okay, at 320K I can see an injector pump, just that I've seen some folks get hosed when not properly diagnosed, I almost had that happen, when the diesel mech showed up and said to the other mech, did you check the 50 amp fuze on the firewall for the glowplugs,  50cent piece almost cost me $700. New fuze $.50, put the old pump back in and ran from 1979 to 1990."
8268,kennyman,2006-12-04 21:08:00,737,"Man, I guess I'm not the only one. Two batteries (two vehicles) and a starter in the last couple weeks. Sorry to hear about everyones pet problems. I can't believe the the person didn't stop to check the dog after they hit it. Unbelievable! Anyway about the deisel. Okay, 99.9% says this isn't your issue (not sure what yours is doing) ,but I had to mention it just incase. I didn't want to read a week down the road that this was the issue and I hadn't mentioned it I would have felt terrible. Had a buddy with a Golf who was having fuel delivery problems. Turned out the intake manifold was almost completely plugged. I'd never even heard of this happening,but apparently it's not totally uncommon with Vdub deisels. He ripped it apart himself,unplugged the manifold and the car came right back to life. His mileage etc. increased from really good to phenominal again and all is well. He said he'll have to do it after another couple hundred thousand k's. Could be worse, most cars don't even last this long."
8330,Fisherman,2006-12-05 00:19:00,7201,"Yor're right on that one, the newer ones have an EGR valve that can really get plugged and cause greeat havoc."
8332,irishfield,2006-12-05 00:25:00,26272,For Maureens sake...I hope your suggestions are both wrong... as her car is done and I'm picking her up to go get it in the am.
