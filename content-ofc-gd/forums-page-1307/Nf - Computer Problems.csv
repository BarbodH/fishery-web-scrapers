If I can find the same model it should be an easy swap... trouble is, I can't find one.  Looking for an ASUS P4P800SE  Board is still under warrenty... anybody ever deal with ASUS?  Any help is appreciated -Brian"
8272,setomonkey,2006-12-04 21:14:00,872,"Brian,  If it stil under warranty shouldn't you be able to get a replacement from where you purchased it, or a local ASUS dealer?  Mike"

8412,SlowPoke,2006-12-05 09:17:00,2984,"setomonkey: it is under manufacturers warranty but the supplier only offers 1 year. In other words, I pay the shipping and labour for re/re. It would be cheaper to go the warranty route but it could take a month - maybe more with holidays.  terry: thanks for the link, have you dealt with this company? It worries me when they say;  Price: $111.18 CDN Status: In Stock (will ship as soon as possible)  I shouldn't be so paranoid but I'm still waiting for an order of reel parts from BC that said the same thing on thier website ... I ordered in October and they won't return my emails or calls. That reminds me, I should go to PayPal and initiate a claim."

8424,motv8tr,2006-12-05 10:53:00,2587,"I didn't know you could swap out mother boards.  I have a computer here that needs a new Motherboard, and was told by a repair place that it would be cheaper to replace the computer...mind you there could also be a problem with the power supply, said he won't know until the mother board is replaced.  I was going to do this for my Great Nephews mother but will have to wait until after Christmas.  Maureen"
8435,SlowPoke,2006-12-05 12:19:00,2984,"Terry, thanks for the reply.  Hey Mo, your repair place should be able to test the power supply in about ten seconds. You don't need a functional mo-bo to check it. Swapping in a new mo-bo is easy provided it is identical to the one you're replacing otherwise the computer will not know how to handle the new hardware. A different mo-bo would require booting to the windows cd and re-installing the operating system. Your repair place is correct that it may not be worth replacing the mo-bo if a compatable board can't be found. In my case I require a ""socket 478"" motherboard... this socket is what your processor plugs into. If I were unable to find a socket 478 board I would have to upgrade rendering my processor and most likely my memory useless. Thus in essence, building a new computer. If your computer is more than 2 years old, it's likely not cost effective to repair it. You may be able to salvage the hard drive and video card, but not in all cases. They keep building a ""better"" mouse trap. -Brian"
8443,motv8tr,2006-12-05 12:36:00,2587,"Thanks for the info Brian, good to know, this computer is about 6-7 yrs old I think, so ya, after the holidays I'll work on getting her a new one.  Maureen"
