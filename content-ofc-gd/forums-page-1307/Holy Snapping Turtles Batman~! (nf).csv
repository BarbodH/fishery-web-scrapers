7948,Cookslav,2006-12-03 15:29:00,1457,Wow..I knew they were quick but not that quick? Lucky Guy(or Dum?)
7951,Mike the Pike,2006-12-03 15:34:00,3421,"That is one nasty turtle it could replace the Doberman guard dog at home.  Reminds me of when I was a kid my parents took us camping in Peterborough some where .I think it may have been lake Scugog but I am not sure.It was a shallow lake well known for its Muskie fishing.So I was ten years old fishing from shore doing the Pan fish thing and wam I think I am stuck I reel in with all my might and a turtle appears above the water and he is snagged in the front paw.He decides to go back down in the water and starts pulling me in.This had to have  weighed 20 to 25lbs.So the stupid kid that I am ,I would not let my rod go no way I was not going to lose my rod. I'm getting dragged in the water.So I started screaming for help but it took awhile before a man came and helped me he unhooked the turtle and saved my rod..Man you should have seen me I was ballin my eyes out.I wouldn't go fishin until the next day .I wonder if the guy  who helped me is still around .This was 31 years ago.Mike"
7953,Carp,2006-12-03 16:08:00,1488,"That turtle looks hungry for human flesh.  I hooked a hugo turtle in Georgian Bay years ago. Got it near within 20ft of shore where it stopped my retrieve and started hissing. At one point, it sank over the edge of a drop off and snapped my line. Probably close to 2ft. across the back. Glad it didn't get any closer."
7955,ccmtcanada,2006-12-03 16:14:00,7971,Man does that turtle look pissed!!!! :LOL
7966,Rizzo,2006-12-03 17:24:00,4754,"man I hate those things, got a couple in our lake that I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw them (like a discus of course)"
7999,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-03 18:38:00,2585,if i was enclosed in a little box like that i would be pissed to.  not a fan of anything that bites people but dude kinda deserved that lol poking it with pliers what was he thinking?  Thanks for the video i did get a good laugh at it!  CHeers!
8040,huntervasili,2006-12-03 21:44:00,1604,"Those things really are a pain... i had one guy who ate some panfish i had on a stringer... and just tore em apart, didnt realize how big he was till i went to get him a couple weeks later with a net and he wouldnt fit... They eat too many of the fish in there and hes killed at least two beavers in the past year... Gotta get rid of him but i aint gonna let my hands get anywhere near him..."
8043,Terry,2006-12-03 21:49:00,14456,"oh yeah  there use to be lots of them in the rivers and creeks off lake simcoe  saw one crossing the road , a 10 ton truck ran over it and flipped the turtle didn't feel a thing just kept on walking"
8044,aplumma,2006-12-03 21:49:00,6896,"What..... dont you all eat other things with teeth???Some of the best eatin in the world is in that bucket. When you got to fight for your dinner you tend to appreciate the meal even more.  ""9 fingers Art"""
8092,huntervasili,2006-12-04 01:36:00,1604,ROFL... I dont particularily like wrestleing with things that can take off a hand or worse....
8235,Big Swede,2006-12-04 18:29:00,23,  The sight of snapping turtles always fills Cookslav's heart with fear and loathing. Somebody post something about spiders quick.
8240,jason27fish,2006-12-04 18:35:00,90,that is one pissed off looking turtle
8246,JenTavolacci,2006-12-04 18:50:00,68,Hey I don't know if anyone is interested but last summer while fishing we had some unwelcome company....and I had my camera...... Check out those nails   and his tail had a huge moss buildup...    -Jen
8344,Big Swede,2006-12-05 00:48:00,23,Cookslav and I crossed paths with a bruiser a few years back in one of our favourite lakes and it was a jaw dropper. Let's just say the days of dangling our toes in the water are long over.
8357,JenTavolacci,2006-12-05 01:27:00,68,"amazing.....they are so prehistoric too, look at the armor on the one in the photos....pretty cool even though they are a pain."
