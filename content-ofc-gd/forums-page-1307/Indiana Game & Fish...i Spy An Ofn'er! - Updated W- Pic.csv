I'm looking through the ad and I see a picture of this kid holding a nice Smallmouth bass (in a mini-ad for www.sunsetcountry.net). I look closer, and go, ""Hey, I recognize that hat....and the kid wearin' it!""    Sure enough, there's the President & CEO of Jumla Lures, Avery Quesnel....at least they know which male faces the Quesnel family to publish!   Sorry for the bad scan, but it's the best I could do late last night:       Congrats, Avery....and I'll drop the magazine in the mail tonight.  dk"
