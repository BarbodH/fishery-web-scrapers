8253,Terry,2006-12-04 19:54:00,14456,here's what the area looks like today      here is the link to see your lake is frozen or not   ice maps
8266,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-04 20:56:00,0,"Hey Terry,  Perhaps a dumb question on my part    but what is the green on the east side of the lake ??  Lake turnover ??"
8271,Terry,2006-12-04 21:10:00,14456,"you know, I don't know    I don't think that is what it is too late to be an algae bloom  might be where it can see bottom, or the zooplankton  might show up like that, sure someone will know"
8276,Entropy,2006-12-04 21:24:00,747,"Shallow, suspended sediments, glare ... ?  Entropy"
8283,urbanangler1990,2006-12-04 21:44:00,933,nice! when does cooks bay freeze up? for safe ice fishin.
8286,Terry,2006-12-04 21:51:00,14456,well this year it will be Dec 20th     lol   who know    most years before xmas you can be on  part of the bay for perch
8311,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-04 23:30:00,2585,looks like muddy water??? not sure either though. is there a river in that area that may still be flowing high from the rain the past week?
8316,jeffw,2006-12-04 23:51:00,267,The grren is shallow water like the shoals and the colour changes are shallow to deep or vice versa. Cheers jeff and by the way I was at the bottom of cooks bay this morning and it has approximately a inch of ice out a few hundred feet. Won't be long now before some shallow water first ice perch. Cheers Jeff
8320,Greencoachdog,2006-12-04 23:57:00,8163,Green stuff looks like shallows to me... but what the hell is all that white sheyit on the ground around the lake???
8329,Terry,2006-12-05 00:18:00,14456,well much of the area is under 35 ft but the green part out from the long bay is over 100ft
8336,irishfield,2006-12-05 00:29:00,26272,I know the ice shots give an idea of thickness based on colour of blue. Would it be thermal imaging from the satellite that is giving the green to the shallower spots as they cool off first compared to the deep stuff.
8408,JFish,2006-12-05 06:08:00,29,"Hey guys, looks just like muddy water.  You'll see the same thing if you look at the niagara and Lake Erie.   With that crazy rainy weather it looks like mud coming off some of the islands and shore and then just mixing into the lake.  JFish"
8418,Carp,2006-12-05 10:17:00,1488,Pretty chilly last night/this morning. Should be a different picture today.
8442,SlowPoke,2006-12-05 12:33:00,2984," Hey Jeff, I haven't seen you in a while! Out marking your holes this morning? Don't forget that secret hardwater lure you were testing this summer... it's bound to bring in the big perch this winter! -Brian "
8679,jeffw,2006-12-05 23:58:00,267,Shhh your not supposed to tell people the secret weapon Musky spinnerbaits. How have you been we will have to try and get out on old lady simcoe this winter. Cheers Jeff
8717,urbanangler1990,2006-12-06 01:40:00,933, Thnx Terry! i cant wait for first ice!!!
