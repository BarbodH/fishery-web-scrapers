8226,alexw,2006-12-04 18:01:00,74,"Hi all,  I am planning a Xmas get away for 2 or 3 families with kids. Once again I am turning to this great forum for help.  It will be from Dec 23 to Dec 26. Preferred activities include: ice fishing and skiing although none of us has any experience in ice fishing or skiing.  Questions:  1. Is Xmas too early for ice fishing? We live in Toronto and are willing to drive up to 5 hours. I called a hotel in North Bay and was told there is no ice in Nipissin yet. So when does the ice fishing normally start?  2. Does anyone have any good destinations / getaway packages to recommand?  3. What are the do's and don'ts when first time ice-fishing or skiiing?  I know this is a lot to ask, any info / comments would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!  Alex"

8248,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-04 19:07:00,2585,"nipissing is out for you man.  season does not open untill jan 1.  lots of other places to go though, as for ice.....depends on how cold it gets.  norammly by christmas lakes are frozen up north but that is not 100% by anymeans.  Good luck!"
8256,Terry,2006-12-04 20:04:00,14456,"well something around barrie, you have horseshoe valley for skiing and simcoe or cooch for perch and if they are not safe little lake should be fine...........if you want hut operators  to look after you then go north........"
8390,alexw,2006-12-05 03:31:00,74,"Thanks for your inputs so far. Hope we can get some safe ice by Xmas.  lunkerbasshunter, when you say nipissing ""season does not open untill jan 1"", is that based on the regulations or is it because ice hut operators choose not to open until jan 1?"
8410,tapout,2006-12-05 06:42:00,166,Its the MNR regulations.  No fishing until Jan 1st. I am heading up to Nippissing on Jan 1st and spending 3 nights there.
8438,Bob,2006-12-05 12:25:00,370,"We usually have enough ice to walk on for the trout  season opener on Jan. 1 and there are some species here that have an all-year open season, ie pike and rainbows. I'd advise care going on the ice before January, depending on the year.  I'm not, however, within your 5 hour drive, closer to seven."
