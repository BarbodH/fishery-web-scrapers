Apparently if they receive a request in a field box they are not programmed for, they enter random text. I've created a new mandatory field in which anyone who registers now must enter the number 987654321. It tells you to do exactly that...but somehow this baffles the bots. We've had several spam bots lately and apparently the internet is being besieged by them. Hope this can slows the my mom hates me down a bit at least."
