8392,nautifish,2006-12-05 03:51:00,1416,Well from feeling like early summer a week ago to a crazy wild storm three days ago and i got to come home to this from work tonight......... Snow snow snow and my poor baby sat covered in snow.....    
8394,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 04:05:00,7971,We've only had a few flurries here on the east end of the GTA.  Nothing like the snow you have there!!!!  Spring will be here soon right???
8396,Joey,2006-12-05 04:16:00,9122,"Wow, looks like you got way more than us here.  Although its accumulating pretty fast right now.  Morning rush hour should be fun  Joey"
8406,Deg,2006-12-05 05:39:00,51,"We aren't the only ones feeling the shock.  I called Ohio tonight and my fishing buddy says it is cold there and the guide we use in Kentucky is freezing his butt off guiding clients for crappie and stripers.  The fish are in shallow and biting but the temps are making for a long day.  Even Mobile, Al registered 34F this morning. Hope GCD had enough sense to put his shirt on. lol"
8407,Rich,2006-12-05 05:57:00,3927,"I just went out for a walk about an hour ago and it was awesome to be walking through snow again, seriously. The non-fun part was shovelling my way to the street... a sign of things to come :S"
8416,Carp,2006-12-05 10:11:00,1488,"I don't mind the snow or even a few super chilly days, but the wind is what gets to me.  I can handle -30 Celcius all day with no wind. I can handle snow falling down all day with no wind.  Add wind to cold or snow and now it gets nasty.   Thanks for the report and pics nautifish."
8417,Greencoachdog,2006-12-05 10:17:00,8163,"  The low here was 24*F yesterday and it's 22*F this morning, as for the shirt... everything I own i got on!  BTW... I really like your new Signature Don!"
