They will photograph it there for me, for the people waiting for prints.  ""Midnight Bandits"" 16 x 20 acrylic on canvas with trompe loeil (fool the eye) painted window frame edge.    Pam"

8353,pameladallaire,2006-12-05 01:19:00,470,"Thanks everyone, I took it in to the museum today and the director of the museum thought it was in a frame! LOL  It's painted to look like a window frame with a handle.  The triptych landscape ""Rushing Waters"" won't be in the show but they absolutely loved it.  Made me feel good anyway.  Pam"
