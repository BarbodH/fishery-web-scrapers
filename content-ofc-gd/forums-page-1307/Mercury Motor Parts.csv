8027,Dondorfish,2006-12-03 20:49:00,1000,"I went to change the gear oil and i noticed the rubber ""O"" ring on the plug screw had deteriated past what I feel safe using. Is there any place in the Niagara Penninsula that I can purchase these from. Think I'd like to change the whole screw plug and O ring. I used to get parts threw Port Pier Marine - but I hear that they have closed shop.   Anyone local have any other suggestions?   Don"
8061,Fisherman,2006-12-03 23:38:00,7201,"Take your screw along with the rubber ""O"" ring to your local Car Quest or other auto parts store(maybe NAPA), they should be able to match up the part."
8062,irishfield,2006-12-03 23:40:00,26272,I'd toss the O-ring and go with a plastic washer...but that's just me!
8063,lew,2006-12-03 23:48:00,12767,"My Merc came from the factory with the plastic washers (at least I think their plastic) and I change them every year when I do the lower unit.  One of the least expensive parts on the engine, but good insurance against leaks  I get them at the local marina when I buy my winterizing stuff."
8082,PERCHER,2006-12-04 01:03:00,787,"I am with lew,I do the same thing.New washers every time."
8432,Chris Cross,2006-12-05 12:07:00,46,"You should change the washer everytime. Some O.M.C. motors came with plastic washers. There are reusable, but they don,t seal as well as the other. Some units have O ring built in to the screw.They are reusable but you got to put on really tight. I prefer the single use fiber type. They seal the best are the cheapest. CX"
