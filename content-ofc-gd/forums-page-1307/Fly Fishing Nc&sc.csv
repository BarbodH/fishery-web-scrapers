I have a good bit of info as of now for the areas but wanna confirm some of it. I havent really fished too much there, only 3 times before, and figure midges are going to be the best bet for winter hatches. Anyone have any recomendations for rivers in the area?...I know field and stream ranked several rivers in the top 100 trout waters... Thanks for any response,  Bill"
8124,BabyHerc,2006-12-04 04:37:00,285,"Not sure about the Carolinas, but a lot of Colorado, Tennessee and Arkansas waters have large ""hatches"" of mysis shrimp, which you probably have already read about.  That's all I got, sorry."

We just used small spinners and stuff. A whole day permit is $7.00 to fish the streams in that area. They stock the rivers with trout on a regular basis.  Lot's of stopping off points along the highway to fish.  Beautiful country there. The mountains all through NC and Tenessee are beautiful."
