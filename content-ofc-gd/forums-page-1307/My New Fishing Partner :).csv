She is 11 weeks old and has been with us since last Wednesday and already fetches, sits when on a leash and goes to the door when she needs to go the washroom  Although she's pretty sneaky. Last night she was sleeping in her kennel and when I left the room she would get up and go on the couch LOL!  When I'd say down and put my hand in her kennel and say bed she'd huff and climb in and go back to sleep LOL!  This is a pic of her last time on the couch once we figured out she wouldn't sleep in her kennel if she was allowed up on the couch LOL! Man it's hard to say no to a puppy hehe! "
8460,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 14:09:00,7971,Awwww....great puppy!!! She's gonna love being out on the water with you!!!
8462,OhioFisherman,2006-12-05 14:16:00,6623,Pretty puppie!

8464,nautifish,2006-12-05 14:18:00,1416,Man it's hard to say no to a puppy hehe!   You'll be wishing you had though in six months time....lol  She is adorable......
8466,Whopper,2006-12-05 14:30:00,2174,Nice looking pup  Whopper
8488,Garyv,2006-12-05 15:54:00,547,"You MUST establish who is the Alpha dog, once done you will find it much easier to do what she tells you to!  As far as being on furniture heres Amy in the truck camper and trailer....and I could care less!   "
8500,Bly,2006-12-05 16:25:00,1556,"Too Cute!!   Awww let him on the couch    Being practical, I understand the ""no dogs on the furniture"" thing but I just love curling up on the couch with my dog at the end of the day.....I compromised, just taught mine to ""ask"" first, when we have company he rarely tries to get up on the furniture with them.  I say rarely cause I don't want to jinx myself and he is still in training.  bly"
8511,RangerGuy,2006-12-05 16:50:00,564,Your right MistyRiver! We have been looking at pups for sometime.. this one just became affordable at the right time  I'll let her up again when she's done training and out of the chew stage LOL!  Tina and I are already fighting for who gets to go home at lunch and let her out for a pee LOL!
8523,setomonkey,2006-12-05 17:12:00,872,Cute puppy!  They are adorable at that age...  Mike
8540,motv8tr,2006-12-05 17:54:00,2587,"All puppies are adorable and hard to say no to, trust me I know what of I speak lol...but then they grow up to be dogs  .I have three that are on the furniture and in my bed, and I wouldn't have it any other way  Maureen"
8543,graftongal,2006-12-05 18:01:00,145,Hmmm... she reminds me of someone....
8545,snag,2006-12-05 18:04:00,1932,Look at those cute widdle eyes! How can you not pander to her and give her everything she wants??  Woof

8563,aplumma,2006-12-05 19:15:00,6896,Yep my cute little lab puppy used to fit right next to me in my easychair and we would fall asleep together...... Now she lays on the couch with her 10 lb head attached to a 90 lb body on my wifes lap and puts my wifes leg to sleep. I would not have it any other way though.  Art
8871,RangerGuy,2006-12-06 13:56:00,564,LOL! No worries.. she'll be let up on the couch as soon as she's house trained LOL!  HAHAH! That's a great pic Lew!
