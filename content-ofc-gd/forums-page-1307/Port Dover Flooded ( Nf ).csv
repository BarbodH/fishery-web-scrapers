I don't think a year has ever gone by where I haven't been for an Arbor dog at least once or twice (I think you can still see them around my waistline LOL). Anyway, all I'm saying is that it really hit home when I watched the video. I guess because I recognized everything it was different. I couldn't believe the pier was covered. Yikes! Normally the water is WAY down. I had no idea this happened every few years. I guess I just never thought about it. Thanks for posting the video. I'm looking forward to seeing the next one. Also thanks for the lesson on the ""Lake Erie seiche"" Rick."

But i will admit i do love the new look of the arbour & the palm trees that were added to the beach this yr...That was a really nice touch."

I had a cop car sat in my drive way plus two hydro trucks and a few other trucks which were the guys waiting to start removing the tree.  And they were their till around 5-6am the next  morning....  XWRAP CCMT  Thankyou, Glad you enjoyed the video but i hardely find my self worthy of a CNN Reporter.  Cookslave i have seen a few storms over the last four yrs here in dover but nothing compared to friday night.......The wind was so strong could hardly stand and when trying to talk, the wind would just take ur breath away.  I am downloading the second lot of video footage i took friday night....So hope to get it posted before i retire for the night."
