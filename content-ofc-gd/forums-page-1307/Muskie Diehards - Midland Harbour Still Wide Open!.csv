8498,irishfield,2006-12-05 16:21:00,26272,After playing Penetang Taxi service for Maureen and doing my stops in Midland I checked out the Pete Peterson Ramp and channel this morning on the way back home.  No ice on the Bay at all...a very small amount of slush/ice half way down the channel. Ramp/launch area is clear thanks to the current from the stream and someone even hand shovelled the ramp and salted it to boot...so if you're in the mood this week...now you know!
8533,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 17:38:00,7971,Gotta love ppl who look out for others...good on him/her for shoveling and salting the ramp!!!
8534,irishfield,2006-12-05 17:41:00,26272,Might have been the town works guys..but I suspect it was more than likely someone that's goin fishing this afternoon.
8686,fishindevil,2006-12-06 00:12:00,6254,"yes when fishing in the late fall i try to have some salt in my car for just the same reason,i have been stuck at a boat launch before,so been there done that....but just the same its nice that someone did that for us die-hard fisherman"
8707,setomonkey,2006-12-06 01:07:00,872,"diehard is right, it's chilly out there!  Mike"
8709,Mike the Pike,2006-12-06 01:16:00,3421,"Wayne now that the Glastron is gone why don't you throw in your port a boat.This would be be pratical for you .you can avoid backing up this boat no salt at the launch ,no need for 4 wheel drive.Just flip flop fold the top, add a motor and your off Muskie Fishing.What do you say Wayne we are due for some homegrown Muskie pics.  Mike"
8719,irishfield,2006-12-06 01:42:00,26272, Sunny and -1C..the odd passing blizzard ! What you gonna do when winter gets here Mike! LOL  Mike the pike...some vessels better not used this time of year. Port-a-bote on Gbay is right up there with a Ganoe on BOQ !
9099,setomonkey,2006-12-06 22:35:00,872," Bear it with dignity, like every year!  Seriously, winter's okay but I'm happy to see the thaw come March/April...  Mike"
9192,camillj,2006-12-07 01:00:00,1988,I'm there Wayne ... just say when
9198,Crazyhook,2006-12-07 01:06:00,1154,"hmmmmm what ya thinking? i have a few "" personal"" days left"
9221,irishfield,2006-12-07 01:33:00,26272,I'm thinkin it would look a tad different after 6 inches of wet snow last night...rain late this afternoon and freezing rain..now snow.  You'd have to be bringin the boat as well....I'm boatless 'till spring.  Jamie...if you came would you bring an OFC logo or would I need to supply the darn thing....
