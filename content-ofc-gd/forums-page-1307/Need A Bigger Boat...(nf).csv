7936,Carp,2006-12-03 14:11:00,1488,NUTS !!!  I think he might require a diaper for that situation. I know I would.
7943,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-03 14:53:00,2585,sucks to be that guy!
8032,Pinch,2006-12-03 21:26:00,231,"I just recently purchased a kayak and am waiting to collect it at the end of the month.  In the mean time I've been reading everything I can about fishing from them.  I had been getting really excited about it, and since the family and I are going to Florida for the month of July next year I thought that I'd take it with me and go a couple miles out into the Atlantic to catch a few fish.  Then I saw THAT picture and now I'm not so sure!!!  Really, how unlucky would I have to be for that to happen to me.....    lol"
8034,ccmtcanada,2006-12-03 21:34:00,7971, The bottom of your kayak doesn't look like bait to a fish does it??
8039,Pinch,2006-12-03 21:44:00,231,"  Well the thing is I think it sorta does.  I bought one from hobie and it has these pedals that you use as well as paddling.  The pedals are connected to a set of fins that push you through the water!!!  Oh well, if Im not heard from after July then I looked a bit to tasty for the sharks!!"
8046,Terry,2006-12-03 21:53:00,14456,bout the only thing he could do is put his head between his legs and kiss his @$$. goodbye
8047,irishfield,2006-12-03 22:03:00,26272,"Paddle boards, sail/surf boards and I presume Kayaks look like seals to them big toothy critters from below...  Govern yourself accordingly ! You may want to tow a ""trailer bait"". Maybe offer to take someone behind you on a floater board or make up an artificial bait with a 6' styrofoam floater board and a couple fake flippers hangin off the sides! LOL"
8051,JEREMY,2006-12-03 23:02:00,300,I am with carp i would need a diaper for that.
8052,Rattletrap2,2006-12-03 23:03:00,1652,"Gives a whole new meaning to ""topwater"" fishing!"
8055,Roy,2006-12-03 23:11:00,13728,"You didn't happen to get it in Firetiger, did ya?"
8059,irishfield,2006-12-03 23:32:00,26272,Leah's probably wouldn't be a good idea then Roy...  
8088,Carp,2006-12-04 01:27:00,1488,A canoe from the 60's........cool Wayne.
8131,GbayGiant,2006-12-04 05:21:00,1780,Fairly tense indeed.
8150,Pete Maina,2006-12-04 12:21:00,213,Wonder if he's using spinner blades on his paddles  Pete
8151,SlowPoke,2006-12-04 12:26:00,2984,... or a bucktail on the stern!
8425,brickNblock,2006-12-05 11:06:00,598,"Bill, Truly........Seriously S-C-A-REEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!"
8428,Roy,2006-12-05 11:46:00,13728,What I find amazing about these pics is that there's always a photographer on standby not more than 100 feet away. It's uncanny I tell ya.
