8249,Pete Maina,2006-12-04 19:13:00,213,"Hi all,  Wanted to stop in and say hi here. I was going over a bunch of stuff on the phone with Jen the other day - and she told me about this and her conversation with you Joey.  Congrats! Shirt looks great on you  Best Wishes,  Pete"
8251,Joey,2006-12-04 19:35:00,9122,"Hi, thanks Pete.  If you have any other shirts you'd like me to model  But a great product is a great product right  Cheers.  Joey"
8301,aplumma,2006-12-04 22:39:00,6896,"Dang I was getting ready to laugh at TJQ because he called the ""freebie"" offer of $5.00 off on a  small order (50.00)  and free shipping on a large order(150.00). Then I clicked on the link and found the free shirt contest. I guess that qualifies as a contest o well maybe I can harrass Roy about being short......again till I can get a jab in on TJQ.   Art"
8333,Pete Maina,2006-12-05 00:26:00,213,"Hey Joey,  Absolutely ... you just have to accept the fact that you're a great product.  Huh? Roy's short  ... he musta had a tall stool when I met him"
8346,JenTavolacci,2006-12-05 00:52:00,68,ooohhhhh boy........
8604,TJQ,2006-12-05 20:49:00,7806,Hey Art.....  Ill be gunning for you ....
8711,Pete Maina,2006-12-06 01:21:00,213,"Hi,  Still just trying to verify whether or not Roy is actually short"
8714,Terry,2006-12-06 01:30:00,14456,well last time I saw him....     kids were running up to him trying to steal his lucky charms
8752,Roy,2006-12-06 02:52:00,13728,"Thorpe was over tonight. Pete's right, I'm not short."
8756,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-06 02:56:00,621,"Roy is right,we are not short Were just grounded  Everyone just taller ,thats all"
8787,Pete Maina,2006-12-06 03:33:00,213,OOOOOH man ... I love this deal. Fun and laughs are good.  I've heard rumors here on the US side that Roy is 8 foot tall ... not certain on girth ... has anybody taped Roy lately?  Pete
8806,Joey,2006-12-06 05:18:00,9122,I taped him (up) not too long ago  Joey
