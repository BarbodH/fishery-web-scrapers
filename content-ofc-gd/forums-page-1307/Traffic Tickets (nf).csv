8293,Gerritt,2006-12-04 22:12:00,6129,Firstly thank you for all of your advice...  I have decided not to go the xcopper route.. they want 400.00 but promised my points wont go up... I read over the contract and it says if they cant get rid of the points then they pay the ticket and retain the rest... how is that a gaurantee? I am still on the hook for the fine or a portion of it regardless and sill have demerit points on my record... not interested....beside I felt a bit like OJ. Simpson going that route.  I have now decided I am gonna go down to the courthouse and see what they are willing to do for me in terms of working out a deal.. If I am not satisfied with it I will take it to trial.  I am guilty of speeding yes.. I agree. But I do think I have a valid reason regardless of others agree or not.. put yourself in my shoes for just a moment if you disagree.  again I want to that everyone for their input  Gerritt.
8326,Fisherman,2006-12-05 00:17:00,7201," I'm not beating on you Gerritt, but if you look at the big picture and had smoked some poor child darting into traffic, how then do you justify that, what do you say to that parent? I was in a rush to save my child, the hell with yours... I'd be more likely harping on the child care provider you have to make an intelligent decision. If your boy needed medical care, there's always 911 that will get you an ambulance. No fight, no flames, just honest thoughts."
8458,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 14:06:00,7971," You posted the same thought twice in this thread....once was probably enough.  Who said he was driving at breakneck speed recklessly?  He was speeding yes, but was he weaving in and out of traffic, cutting people off, hitting mailboxes on the side of the road?  I dont know...and the only one who does is Gerritt.  A more sympathetic cop may have even given him an escort.  Give the guy a break, the point is that he didn't cause an accident, he didn't hurt anyone else.  He was concerned and probably freaking out and not thinking straight...I know I would be if I had previously lost a child.  I personally would do EVERYTHING in my power to help my own child....absolutely!  I cant even imagine what he was thinking and feeling at the time.  He posted on this board to get some advice...he knows he broke the law and was speeding...let's not tear a strip off the poor guy...."
8492,lew,2006-12-05 16:03:00,12767,"..............  This is in NO way directed at Gerritt  ...................  ccmtcanada, I stated my feelings about reckless drivers earlier in this thread and had no intentions of saying anything else about it, but I honestly am very concerned about your last post.  .........You said ""He was concerned and probably freaking out and not thinking straight"".........  Do you honestly want to share the hiway with somebody in this state of mind, as I know I certainly don't, and this is also the last person in the world I would want to see speeding. It's dangerous enough on the roads with people who are in a normal state of mind, but you seem to be condoning speeding by people who are freaking out and not thinking straight.......pretty darned scary if you ask me.  ..........you also state that ""A more sympathetic cop may have even given him an esccort""..........  Police officers are well trained in hi-speed driving on city streets, plus they have the advantage of red lights and sirens to assist in getting motorists out of their way.  Police officers DO NOT give escorts to other drivers, especially ones who are freaking out behind the wheel of their own vehicles and not thinking straight.........that stuff is strictly out of Hollywood movies.  We have a VERY good system for emergencies in this country........911  Call that # in a residential area and you'll have police, fire and ambulances at your door within minutes and no need for freaking out drivers to be rushing to hospitals and possibly causing more carnage on our roadways.  Fisherman is a 911 dispatcher and could probably tell you tales that would make your blood curdle, so I don't think you have any right to chastize him about either of his posts on this subject.  On a final note, you also said to Fisherman........""You posted the same thought twice in this thread....once was probably enough""..........we have moderators on this board to make the decision as to when something has been said enough.........that's not up to you, or anyone else."
8493,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 16:05:00,7971,Please accept my apologies.  Everyone has points to make here.  I'm sorry if I ruffled feathers on the board.  Cliff
8561,Fisherman,2006-12-05 19:12:00,7201,"Cliff and I sent a couple of PM's and I believe all is well, just different opinions from both sides of the coin. Sometimes my submissions may look horribly misdirected, I assure you, they are not, I have no benefit from ragging on anyone.  I'm just trying to show both sides of what could have happened but fortunately didn't.  One must often visualize events and possible repercussions from different angles so to speak.  I worked for 25 years in enforcement, almost another 10 completed in dispatch like Lew said.  I've seen enough carnage to last a lifetime, that's why I made the comments I did.  Let's go back to fishing, shine up the auger and sharpen hooks, tie on new line, wax the runners on the sled, just got back from town and dang the ponds are frozen, if this keeps up, Little Lake will be hard soon.       Hey MODS, we need a ""Frozen Fishing"" icon."
8564,ccmtcanada,2006-12-05 19:17:00,7971,"Agreed...Fisherman...all is well.  I also PM'd Lew as well, and I believe we are all good.  Never tried ice fishing....I think I'll have to try it out this year....at least once anyways!!"
8592,irishfield,2006-12-05 20:19:00,26272," Come to Maureen's  ""Ice fishing for Tyler"" event in Feb Cliff...it's where I got my first taste of ice fishing last year and had a good time..for a great cause. From today's lift I gave her I'm pretty sure she said Feb 24th was the date in mind for this year."
8600,Spiel,2006-12-05 20:42:00,9065,....I think this one has come to it's conclusion.
7721,hawkeye,2006-12-02 15:58:00,162,"I used X a few years ago for my wife. She could have gone to court or the crown but English is not her first language and sometimes she gets rattled.  Anyway two things it pays to go to court often times the cop won't show or the case gets drawn out so long that they toss the charge  it's not the points that matter to the insurance companies it's the conviction, BUT they have to check your driving record to find it, it's not an automatic notification"
7817,Fisherman,2006-12-02 22:29:00,7201,"Number one: Amen Lew, extremely well said, Number two:  Not picking on anyone, however the next time anyone is doing breakneck speed by recklessly rushing to the scene, think of how many other people they have put at risk trying to save another.  Imagine hitting someone at more than one and a half times the speed limit, or ""T"" boning someone, taking out a couple of other people and destroying someone elses family.  Like Lew said, ""pay the fine and get on with it"" Or maybe you want some graphic details of the last one I got to first, simply because of speed."
8018,medic,2006-12-03 19:57:00,16,"Gerritt,  Just a little advice, go to court ! My friends all wear blue, and any time they have to go to court for a speeding ticket they will encourage you to talk to the crown to have it lowered so they dont have to go through the lengthy procedure of testifying . The crown will usually drop the points and fine, in agreement with the officier if the officier actully shows to the court day ! Hope this helps!!  Medic"
8036,drufis,2006-12-03 21:39:00,45,"Gerrit  Quickly I like you went through this a month ago, never had a ticket, I received one in a pretty good radar trap in Toronto (you would not believe how many cars were pulled over and being pulled over)  the cop told me to go to court and fight it and they would probably knock the points off.  1)  Go to the address on the ticket and request a first meeting with the prosecutor, she will listen to your story, bring something from the daycare and doctor about where you were going.  2)  the prosecutor will then make a reccomendation, they will either do nothing for you or will knock down the speed you will travelling to no points and just a fine or something like that)  3)  then it is up to you to either take what they offer or you can then request a trial in front of the Judge.  You will then have to go back at a later date to go in front of the judge and the cop if he shows.  Go the first meeting route first you have nothing to lose, they normally won't throw the ticket out but will reduce it to something you can live with.  Note - losing points is important but now your insurance can go up for just getting a ticket.  I had a perfect record and that ticket cost me $300 dollars for just getting a ticket which after all was said and done go knocked down to doing 10 over an no points but because I did get a ticket I no longer qualify for the best rate.  I hate the whole insurance industry no tickets or accidents in 17 years of driving and I no longer qualify because I got one ticket?  But that's a rant for another day."
8178,OhioFisherman,2006-12-04 13:59:00,6623,"Sorry Gerritt, I hope your son is OK!"
8179,JerseyDog,2006-12-04 14:01:00,190,"NEVER PLEASE GUILTY WITH AN EXPLANATION FOR ANY MOVING VIOLATION BECAUSE ONCE GUILTY, THEY CANNOT REDUCE THE POINTS, ONLY THE FINE.  ALWAYS PLEAD NOT GUILTY AND THEN DO THE DEAL WITH THE CROWN."
8219,robin,2006-12-04 17:43:00,46,Yah what the grummppy fart said LOL... Cops just here way to many stories and if they beleaved everyone they would never give a ticket. So in defence to him he just didnt know if you were lying or telling the truth.. Goto court explain the situation and hope for the best. Good Luck Robin
8247,Kirk,2006-12-04 19:03:00,347,"Don't plead guilty with explanation, or have a pre-trial meeting with the Crown, set a trial date, hope for a no show from the cop or explain your circumstances to the cop if he attends court or the crown (basically the info in your initial post on this thread with respect to your children), your good driving record, your age and tell them your financial dependents.  That should either a) get the charge tossed out if the cop doesn't show up or  get it reduced points and fine wise to something bearable.  If the cop is not there on the trial date, DO NOT agree to postponing the date, have it withdrawn.  [ Having said that, I also agree with Lew, being a new dad has made my gas foot a bit lighter, my philosophy is I won't be much good to my family killing myself in a wreck, or killing someone elses child or dad.  AND, I'm not a doctor so seconds don't count for my arrival.  If it were a true emergency, god forbid, they'd be dialing 911 for quick trained help, calling me means its something that 'eventually' needs to be done based on safe driving arrival times ]"
8250,Vanselena,2006-12-04 19:34:00,269,"This is my first post.  Not all tickets are justified.  My wife got a ticket for careless driving that I still don't think she should have been charged for.  She was driving when she felt faint. She tried to pull over but went unconscious befor she could stop. She hit another vehicle. I arrived and took her to the hospital immediatly, and after some tests found out her blood Oxygen level was very low.  I brought the hospital report to court and pleaded not guilty for her.  Bottom line is she was still charged with careless and with the accident her insurance went from $1600 a year to $4200 a year.  She had no previous tickets for the past 10 years. After 3 years her insurance has finally started to go down.  So if factual medical proof doesn't help, I don't see how your reason for speed will either.  Matthew"
8254,ehg,2006-12-04 19:57:00,2666,"As others have stated above set a trial date. You will get a trial date in the mail. Usually it is 7 months to a year from occurence. The cop won't show up. The fine will either be withdrawn or really slashed down. I've done this a few times. Even argued my way out of a photo radar ticket by adamantly insisting it wasn't me but other cars. You have a solid honest reason for speeding and evenually you will pay little and not lose any points.  Good luck,  ehg"
8258,ccmtcanada,2006-12-04 20:07:00,7971,"The trial thing doesn't always work.  I was told by a cop who pulled me over to do that....as he said he never shows up in court.  So I did that, and guess what?  He showed up."
8274,solopaddler,2006-12-04 21:14:00,8605,"Wow, IMO if there ever was a case to justify speeding, yours is it. If I was in the same situation I'd have likely been clocked at a lot more than 81km....When it comes to the safety of your child, well that comes first and foremost as far as I'm concerned. Can't believe the cop wrote you a ticket, by all means fight it!"
8275,douG,2006-12-04 21:20:00,2693,Welcome to Vanselena.  Great to have you on board here at OFC.
