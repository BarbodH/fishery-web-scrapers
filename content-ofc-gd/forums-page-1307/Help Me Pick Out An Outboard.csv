8624,glen,2006-12-05 21:51:00,2641,I see a motor i want online but i aint so sure about the options.  It is a 20hp honda.  It has power tilt but no trim.  Can the tilt be used to tilt the motor a little for shallow water drive?
8637,Mike the Pike,2006-12-05 22:31:00,3421,Well Glen you have made the right choice I myself have a Honda BF50 with power trim .I had a quick look on the Honda website it says it can be put in any position but this could be optional.I am not sure if this feature is available in tiller model.Check out the specs on     www.hondamarine.ca.   Mike

8645,glen,2006-12-05 22:36:00,2641,I am getting the remote model.  So the tilt is not just full up or full down.  Is the tilt control on the remote trottle control unit?  Thanks for the help.
8664,Mike the Pike,2006-12-05 23:28:00,3421,I would thank fisherman Glen .Just press the link in his post and you will see the demonstration in the video.The control seems to be located on the tiller handle.My BF50 has one up and down control just below the motor cover.I also have a switch loacated in front of my seat for trimming when running at high speed.It all depends on what year the motor is.My is 2001.Find out from whoever has it for sale what it has.good luck.Mike
8668,glen,2006-12-05 23:44:00,2641,I was looking on the canadian site.  the site  fisherman gave me is better.  It says you can run at speed while tilting the motor.  I will get a remote switch if it dosnt come with one.  Ok problem solved.  I will order it tomorrow.  thanks.
8879,aplumma,2006-12-06 14:14:00,6896,The tilt feature is for trimming the motor 22 degrees positive and -3 degrees negative angle while you are under load and running on plane. The rest of it is used to raise the motor out of the water or high enough to clear the bottom off of plane. The above numbers are from my Mercury 40 Hp jet drive so check the manual for yours to see if they are the same.  Art
