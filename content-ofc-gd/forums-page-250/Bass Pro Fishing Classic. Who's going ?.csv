841283,Dan668,2014-03-14 23:04:00,1120,Ended up picking up the Pro Qualifier suit. Only thing I've ever purchased from bass pro. Not sure if I'm going to keep it. Torn between it and the 100mph. Missed the bonus points though. Ended on the 12th. Was a day late. Damn school tests and the snow storm!
837852,tizfun,2014-02-23 01:26:00,292,Got my Flyer in this week and saw some deals in there that will make me head out on Friday morning..  Anyone else heading out ?  Tiz  
837853,bassfighter,2014-02-23 01:34:00,366,They are also having their free Shipping weekend .
837865,Dan668,2014-02-23 02:13:00,1120,"May go, interested in the pro qual rain gear. Still undecided which to get though. Other than that, didn't see much else."
837866,wkimwes,2014-02-23 02:18:00,76,"I'm going Friday evening just to grab some line and some lures that were marked on sale.  Other than that, I wasn't blown away by the sales."
837869,tizfun,2014-02-23 02:55:00,292,Was there today and I too was looking at the BPS pro qualifier suits.. Not much of a selection unless you're wearing sizes XL and up. Lot's on 2XL & 3XL. Spoke with a lady there and she indicated that they will be getting more in for the sale.. Sale prices are the lowest I've seen them since this store has opened..  You'll be saving over $100.00 on the complete suit.
837876,steelhunter,2014-02-23 03:24:00,81,Can you view the flyer online I never got it

I know Cabelas usually has their gore-tex rainsuits on sale too a couple times a year, and I have been told they are even better than the BPS ones. Anyone have any info on a date?  thanks Pete"
838130,BucktownAngler,2014-02-24 15:23:00,582,"was thinking about it for the reel trade in, but it seems like Sail's no tax sale works out better then the trade in"
838133,BillM,2014-02-24 15:28:00,17367,You gotta spend a lot of $$$ on a new reel in order to make that trade in worth while...   Still always nice to walk around and look at all the new gear.
838149,206,2014-02-24 16:49:00,563,"i might go to grab the Abu Garcia Revo SX, and some small lures for crappies and walleye, but sail also has no tax and 15 % off of everything right now so i might go there as well, looking for a spinning reel. Sail has No Tax AND 15% Off??? Can you point me to where you seen that please.  I hate going its so over whelming i forget half the stuff i went for lol  Is the Curado for 115 a good deal?"
838152,BillM,2014-02-24 17:03:00,17367,"No, Sails '15% sale' is a no tax sale.... oh wait it's really a 2% off sale!"
