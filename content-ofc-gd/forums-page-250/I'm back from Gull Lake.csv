377438,Muskieman,2009-08-28 15:32:00,2472,"Here goes ... We left early on Tuesday morning and headed towards HWY 805..the first 85 kms is very accessible by car but then it gets rough...the last 10 kms are brutal it takes 1 1/2 hours...washouts and boulders abound. 4x4 only or ATV.  We got to Gull in 3 hours ..set up ""Camp Kirkwood"" in under 2 hours..then it was time for a Beer or two.  I decided to go fishing but there was no camera to be found..""thus no fish pics"" it was later recovered by the beach my daughter was snapping pictures and left it there. I managed to boat 2 fair Lakers around  4lbs  and 30 or so Smallies... but alas no Walleye. we kept ""I can't beleive I'm gonna say this "" SMALLIES for shore lunch!!!  they weren't bad  and the trout was very good.  All in all we had us a great time..but kinda froze our butts off at night as the temps plunged to 3*.  I hope this works..testing one pic....see what happens                         RFS "

377445,Nemo,2009-08-28 15:47:00,727,Just use the insert image tool in the tool bar  and insert the file location URL from http to the .jpg  as below  http://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x268/su...Gull2009001.jpg
377450,Muskieman,2009-08-28 16:19:00,2472,This is how my Min-Pin enjoyed her holiday...sometimes I swear she's part beaver.     RFS 
377519,Jonny,2009-08-28 21:34:00,1380,Reminds me of a few of the trips I used to take before we moved to the lake. That one pic showing water on the road and the lengthwise logs looks like a real killer!  And scratches on that nice truck! Hopefully you can buff most of them out.  What we won't do to get a good camping spot and some good fishing!
377527,tjsa,2009-08-28 22:25:00,1578," I swear that that looks like where I was going to go this weekend, but the bugs are brutal up here right now. And, no, I was not going to go into Gull lake, because I am on the west side of Lake Superior, but that picture looks exactly like one place up here. I can even picture the 2 1/2 year old bull moose with his head buried in the water last time there. His eyes got really, really big when he pulled his head up and we were there not 20 yards from him,   :lol:  And whats wrong with eating smallies, I love eating them, they have a slightly sweeter taste than walleye to me.  Thanks for sharing."
377531,solopaddler,2009-08-28 22:37:00,8605,"Quite a trek, did you get any big eyes?"
377540,Muskieman,2009-08-28 23:00:00,2472,  No ...no big eyes..     unfortunately..I tried but failed maybe in September..   RFS

377557,Muskieman,2009-08-29 00:33:00,2472,  3 x  coats of McGuiars and some Mother's Back to Black..before leaving should have done the trick..I'll find out Sunday when I wash it. The guy with the Excursion had the right idea with his .Maybe a rental?.. He put some body man cling-stick prep mask film on his ..  This guy was from Ohio he got a good Idea...I'll try to get some of that film for September.  RFS    
377567,Greencoachdog,2009-08-29 01:11:00,8163,No fish pics = skonk!!!
