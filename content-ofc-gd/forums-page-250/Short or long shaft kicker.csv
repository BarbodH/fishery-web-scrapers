840993,fisher,2014-03-13 12:30:00,451,"I bought a new smokercraft 16 foot pro angler and am getting a 9.9 hp mercury kicker to go with the 115 main motor. Should I insist on a long shaft for the kicker or would the short shaft be fine?  Not sure if it was specified in the contract one way or the other (I have to check tonight when I get home) but if it's a short shaft that I am getting, would that be okay(and not worth insisting on the long shaft)?  Or should I definitely get the long shaft?  I will be using the kicker solely for trolling Lake Ontario for salmon.  Never back trolling (I read that may be a consideration for a long shaft). Thanks in advance for your input/experience."

841005,dave524,2014-03-13 13:08:00,4508,"Always go long shaft on a kicker, lets you troll in  bumpier water without cavitating or drowning it. Especially if it is mounted on a bracket off to the side."
841006,BillM,2014-03-13 13:12:00,17367,Long shaft for sure.
841010,fisher,2014-03-13 13:22:00,451,Ok. I just got my wife to look over the contract and it's an elpt 9.9 merc pro kicker. So an internet search seems to suggest that means E-electric L- long shaft PT - power trim.  Please correct me of I am wrong.  Don't want to call the dealer if I don't have to.  Thanks again.
841012,BillM,2014-03-13 13:41:00,17367,That would be correct.

No dealer would be upset to answer a question regarding a purchase, the only stupid question is the one that is not asked. If we give you the wrong information, then you won't be able to dispute the supply of the motor if it turns out to be the wrong one for your needs."
841019,Fisherman,2014-03-13 14:08:00,7201,"Lets put it this way, if you have a 20 inch transom and put on a short shaft, you'll be doing nothing more that blowing around a bunch of foamy water."
841024,mattaw,2014-03-13 15:12:00,162,"Long shaft for sure. And yup, you're spot on with what ELPT means"
841031,fishindevil,2014-03-13 15:25:00,6254,yes ELPT means just that....and yes long shaft for sure.... ...
842021,c10,2014-03-19 07:13:00,131,The consensus will be long-shaft no doubt! It really is necessary out there
