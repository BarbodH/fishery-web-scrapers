840870,jimca11,2014-03-12 18:31:00,34,Does anyone know where I can get a copy of a map (or purchase one) of Jack Lake near Apsley. I know it is fairly popular but could not find anything on Angles Atlas or at Adventure Fishing Maps. Heading up in the fall and from looking on Goggle Earth it looks like it could be tricky with all the rocks and Islands.

Not 100% accurate, but gives me a good idea of what's going on and places to try to scope out (plus there are some people that add community edits letting you know things too). I think I paid like $20 for it.  The only other one I found quickly was this: http://www.backroadmapbooks.org/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=93_126_140_1808"
840926,ONbuckhunter,2014-03-12 23:55:00,39,"Just an fyi.  There are  a lot of shoals in middle of the basins that are not on maps or navionics.  I use navionics a lot and two shoals I fish are not marked, and not on navionics yet will ruin a boat.  Kinda surprising considering they are right in middle of travel ways."
841026,Consigliere,2014-03-13 15:16:00,121,This lake is available on Navionics+.  1ft contour detail throughout.  Best $30 you can spend on your Iphone.
841044,jimmer,2014-03-13 17:24:00,2730,"Call Jack at Adventure Fishing Maps. He has one for sure. 705-292-6175 It came up with I googled it. Not necessarily showing the map, but it's listed, so he has one."

841066,adempsey,2014-03-13 20:30:00,1498,"Trak Maps sells one.  I have a couple, but I need to clean them up.  They are a mess.   PM me your email address or I can post a link to a pdf version if you want.  You can also view it online for free with the Navionics WebApp."
