Big bonus with that place is there always seems to be an attractive female working the pumps."

840018,turtle,2014-03-06 11:26:00,274,"I also recommend the St. Ambrosie oatmeal stout-my favourite.  There are many tasty ""craft:"" beers out there.  Any many tasty beers out of Quebec.  Guiness is boring in comparison but I'll drink it.  For the hot summers I switch to the hoppy IPA style beers."

Not a fan of the Brooklyn Dry Irish Stout, won't be buying that again..  Sinha isn't bad, nothing great but it's not bad..  Had some of the Tom Green Milk stout lastinght, it's about on par with a decent stout."

The best stouts I've had have been from the US, but my favourite local pick is from Hockley Valley microbrew.  They make a few varieties that are a little different but the stouts are my favourite.  Anyone else try/enjoy em?"

I don't know if it is sold at the LCBO orif you would have to go on a road trip to ST. Thomas which is near London to get some. They do have a website , if you are interested."

I've been making regular trips down to NY to pick up a few of my favs (Sam Adams Cream Stout, Left Hand Brewing Co Milk Stout Nitro, Bells Kalamazoo Stout, and about a dozen others)...   Most if not all of these beers aren't even available in Canada, which really sucks.  "
839762,leaf4,2014-03-05 02:25:00,2466,"I like the Sam Adams, I don't venture too far into the stout, but if you haven't already, I suggest giving Innis & Gunn a try (original) it's not a stout but it's cask brewed and delicious, if possible get it in the glass bottle, tastes better to me than when it's in a can."

839768,Fang,2014-03-05 03:11:00,1330,Can't tell you if it's readily available but R&B from BC have a Bacon stout that was hard to put down. A buddy brought some over at Xmas and I never asked where he got it.  I have to be in that perfect frame of mind for stout but bête noir out of QC is good and one that I have not found but read great reviews is from Yukon brewing company
839777,Joeytier,2014-03-05 10:59:00,3990,"Lots of great stouts coming from the upper states, especially the east coast.  Wish there was more distribution.  The muskoka cranberry stout was always a favourite of mine but it's just a seasonal of course."
839779,singingdog,2014-03-05 11:33:00,1047,"I'll second the Muskoka stout. Don't let the ""double chocolate"" put you off, it's not sweet at all. It is also one of the best rib braising stouts I have used. Ontario microbrew: check out Whitewater Breweries MIdnight stout....very tasty. http://whitewaterbeer.com/"
839795,solopaddler,2014-03-05 13:16:00,8605,"Muskoka Dark Billy, but then I do believe you're already familiar with that one.  What I'd like to know is why do you always bring swill on all of our trips?"

839844,homie66,2014-03-05 16:48:00,3,I second the Tom Green beer.  Beau's makes some excellent beers.  I also liked a milk stout I tried at Christmas LA VACHE FOLLE IMPERIAL MILK STOUT.  LCBO site says it's discontinued so grab a bottle if you can find it.

Another of my favorites is the Highlander Blacksmith Smoker Porter by the Highlander Brewing company located north of Algonquin park. I also like to stop by the Church Key brewing company north east of Campbellford in the summer for free samples. They make some great beer for taste testing. Ross"
