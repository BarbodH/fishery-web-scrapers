Both Burtess and I have been trying a few times this hard water season,,but always seem to be going other ways. I seen he was heading up this way today,and since I had the day off to go fishing as well,I hooked up and confirmed a meet on the ice.  Another first meet with another OFC member . Super guy. .  The other first to this outing,Kevin nailed his first white fish. He brought that fish to the hole like he had caught many of them. As it popped it,s head out the hole,I wasnt going to let it get away. I bury my hands down the ice cold hole and flip the fish out.  Nice popping of the white fish cherry Kevin.    As always,nice to meet up with a OFC member.  As for me and fish. On then off. Marked lots had a few chasers.  Oh well,back at it again for the last day for whities and lakers in the morning."
