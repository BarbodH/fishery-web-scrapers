I fund some open holes way over on the other side of where we were fishing and decided to try it out, after a few rips, i feel the rod bend and that beautiful sound of the drag fire up, unfortunately it was a bit loose and the fish managed to get off, it felt like a nice one, darn it! I jigged some more with no luck and we moved over to that spot, i started jigging again with a minnow head and finally a fish on the line! Felt like a nice laker but to my surprise a ling pops his head out of the hole! Ive never had this happen before so was kinda surprised a bottom feeder would chase a fast action spoon. We put one set line down each and one jigging, i was using a wiliams for a few hours straight and tried every open hole i could find, from 40-160 feet, with nothing but that single ling to show for. Switched over to a batboy and as soon as it got down there i had a bite, there were tons of fish down there through the hole water column but very picky, they would only hit live minnows and they HAD to be jigged as well!! We released around 15 fish all together, not too bad for the evening considering its usually almost dead after noon. Most were caught on the bad boy with a small orange glow in the dark tube tipped with a shiner, second biggest producer was the set line, which i landed the 2nd ling on just before dark, as well as some nice lakers, i released a few of the bigger fish and kept some smaller ones, for a little fish fry, biggest i kept was 21 inches biggest caught was 23 inches. Not a bad day out bit really cold and windy had to hide behind some points, lol! heres a pic for you guys, also had another pic of the ling but i swiped the screen by accident and dang phone deleted it, can't find a way to get it back."
841771,Joeytier,2014-03-17 21:35:00,3990,"Great fishing.  Ling are not exclusively bottom, and are typically very aggressive and piscovorous during the winter!"
841776,BowSlayer101,2014-03-17 22:38:00,296,"thanks for the kind words! I never knew they come off bottom that much, all i get them on usually is set lines with a huge chunk of minnows lol!"
841784,Maverick,2014-03-17 22:59:00,371,"Nice fish. I've only fished there once and got skunked, a buddy of mine fishes there quite often and has never been skunked, guess I should have gone with him."
841788,Acountdeleted,2014-03-17 23:48:00,2562,Great day of fishing. Glad you had success.  Man do I ever love fishing Lake Joe.
841805,BowSlayer101,2014-03-18 02:11:00,296,"thanks guys!! Oh ya its an awesome lake, always produces for me, best laker lake i can think of as far as numbers go!"
841845,gino,2014-03-18 13:35:00,400,wow!!! look at that!!!  :clapping:  awesome job!!! that's good size ling
841893,BowSlayer101,2014-03-18 19:46:00,296,"Haha, thanks Gino, those ling sure were tasty!"
841905,misfish,2014-03-18 20:17:00,29133,"Haha, thanks Gino, those ling sure were tasty! How did you cook them up?  Nice haul.  I was planning on heading there saturday."
841906,BowSlayer101,2014-03-18 20:21:00,296,"i just boiled them, then fried them like i would normally fry any other fish, some flour, pepper, salt, and sometimes milk and eggs. The hardest part for me is cleaning them, hard to get the skin off nicely to do the fillet, always have some meat go off wight he skin, lol. Make sure you are there early, big lakers in the morning then after noon just little guys up to 24"" i found that fishing deeper produces bigger fish and they are in big quantities, saw lots of herring go by, darn things wouldn't bite though!"
841908,misfish,2014-03-18 20:58:00,29133,"Thanks for the reply.  Sorry meant to ask,ice thickness? Can I park on the ice?"
841913,Rod Caster,2014-03-18 21:10:00,5784,Ling and lakers; a good combo!
841932,Christopheraaron,2014-03-18 22:26:00,3525,"Thanks for the reply.  Sorry meant to ask,ice thickness? Can I park on the ice? Hey Brian, I was up there last weekend and the one before, we were on about 25"" of ice (complete guess there), most of it was good but there was about 5"" of white stuff on top. I did see a pickup out but that ice is deteriorating fast, check before you go out."
841938,tb4me,2014-03-18 22:50:00,3295,Nice catch! I bet dinner was awesome!
841941,SirCranksalot,2014-03-18 22:57:00,3291,"I'm told to clean them like a catfish, but I've never cleaned a catfish so that doesn't help me!  .....but it might help you."
841945,BillM,2014-03-18 23:15:00,17367,"Thanks for the reply.  Sorry meant to ask,ice thickness? Can I park on the ice?  That's one lake I wouldn't be driving out on..    Lots and lots of current."
842008,Joey,2014-03-19 02:54:00,9122,"Great report, nice catches!"
842014,BowSlayer101,2014-03-19 04:02:00,296,"thanks for the kind words!!, at the spot i was on ice varied from 30-35"" and there was a truck that passed me, you can park on the ice for sure, ice is still very very thick!"
