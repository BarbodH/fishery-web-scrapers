Snow was average 3' deep all over the lake, with drifts unto 5' deep with heavy slush underneath.  Packed down a 1 mile track with the skidoos yesterday, the one heavy slush patch we encountered was froze solid this morning as it was -30C last night (crazy weather).  Was like iceshack racing with the grizzly with it's tracks and the 1200cc skidoo in low gear, the darn thing was catching air! Good fun….more fun than i managed to have with that shack all year as i never even managed to fish in it once….come to think of it i never managed to fish that lake at all this year….what a messed up winter!   Enjoy the video of this morning's antics, don't forget to select 720pHD.     "

Would they still give you a ticket if you were using your wooden permanent style hut on a sled as a makeshift portable hut and towing it around with a machine hooked up? I can see leaving it out overnight being a risk as ice can break up and degrade quickly making for some garbage in the lake, but if the ice is safe I can't see the harm in doing this if you take it with you at the end of each day?    You do not need to register your ice hut or abide by specific removal dates:"

I'm in zone 5 so don't register  LOL….and you answered your own question no?   I'd stick with the clam, save a small fortune in gas and snowmachine belts…..lol."

We tackled it early this morning with -24 temps. No slush and once we got it out of the drifts that were around it then we had smooth cruising. Still close to 40"" of ice on the lake."
