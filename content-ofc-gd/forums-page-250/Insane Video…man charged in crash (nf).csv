840863,Steve,2014-03-12 17:48:00,2075,"to confirm, yes, insurance companies use what is called ""fault determination rules""....these do not follow the highway traffic act.  so hta and copper can say your ""not at fault"" while the fdr will place you at 100% at fault.  i don't agree with it one bit.  also, the insurance adjuster DOES NOT have to review any dashcam footage.....you'll likely have to hire a lawyer to get the insurance company to review any applicable footage."
841041,SHAD,2014-03-13 17:12:00,134,"They should look at the police report Bill, but to match the post above....... the lady that parked her car in the middle of the 6th and started walking home... and my son found the car in the white out. Police charged the lady and it's in the report... the insurance company from some magic ""table"" say he's at fault for hitting her from behind and have doubled his premiums already despite the fact they haven't even come to a settlement on his rode off car yet. As for a dash cam... in his case all you wouldn't have seen was white.. lol  If you can prove that there was no visibility to see the veh parked in front then your son should be able to get the fault overturned and coded as zero percent so it's not counted as an ""at fault"" claim on his insurance record.  Escalate the situation to the insurance company's claims manager or ombudsman's office for fault review.  Last recourse is in section 6 of the Ontario Auto Policy on what ya need to do if disagree with the fault ruled on the claim.  Cheers."
841043,fisher,2014-03-13 17:23:00,451,Dash cam with separate hd 270 degree front and rear mounted cameras costs less than $100 on ebay (includes cost of a 32 gb micro sd card). I'd say it is worth it.  I have had one on my car for over a year and it came in handy once when someone reversed into me when stopped at a parking lot exit.  He was sticking too far out into a live lane and decided that he wanted to reverse - only I had driven up behind him already.  He didn't dispute reversing into me but then again easily could have said I hit him from behind.  I just got a second unit for my wife's car.

Since I live in dead-center redneck-ville, there are some stoooopid people who drive the same roads as her.. one of my to-do items today is to confront one of the drivers who was driving 70 on the highway and didn't like that my wife passed him so he her rode her butt for 5 mins at 90 and then passed her and did 110 the rest of the way. He's getting a piece of my mind today I'll tell you."

840422,Moosebunk,2014-03-09 12:26:00,3970,"Not unbelievable at all... just the way it is everyday out there now.  First on scene to an accident last fall outside of Westport.  Guy (I'm pretty sure) was on cell phone and driving wrong side of road hit big truck with trailer as well.  He was in and out of consciousness a couple times but while awake wanted me to find his cellphone... Adamant about it at times.  Was thinking more about keeping him still as his glasses were impregnated into his forehead and his hip was mushy from his dash crushing his femur into it.  When he got that phone he appeared to be trying to clear his history.  The other accident a few hundred meters from where my kids stand out and wait for the bus each day, police on scene when I stopped (friend of mine) explained guy simply drove off the road while texting.  I guess he tried to clear his history and even called his girlfriend after the crash to have her try and clear hers, but the police have a way of finding things out otherwise.  Different time a little further down the road... and who knows???  Cellphone fines should be $1000's.  Not kidding.  Three offences and total loss of license for years.  Not kidding."
840425,lew,2014-03-09 12:56:00,12766,"No cell phones involved in this story, but a whole lot of stupidity.  It was on hwy 28 south of Burleigh Falls 2 years ago and if I hadn't seen it myself I wouldn't have believed it.  Guy was driving southbound in a real hurry and wanted to pass the car in front of him but because of the heavy northbound traffic couldn't do it. Instead of waiting for an opening he actually went onto the soft shoulder and passed the car on the right side, doing at least 100 kmh.  Gravel and dirt was flying everywhere, the moron was fishtailing all over the place and the guy being passed actually had to move over towards the northbound lane and on-coming to get away from this moron.  I was just waiting for this jerk to roll into the ditch, infact I was actually hoping he would before he killed an innocent family but sadly he kept it together and roared on down the hiway.  "

I'm not saying people shouldn't be more careful or that cell phones are OK...because they certainly are not. I'm just saying that if you honestly think you couldn't have caused an accident at some point in your life while behind the wheel...I think your only fooling yourself."

If there are no witnesses it basically comes down to your word vs the other drivers and how the cop perceives what happened. If both people tell the truth then there is no issue. But, if the person who caused the accident is good at story telling and convinces the cop that something besides the truth happened or you mix up your story and/or facts you could be found partially at fault which means you get to pay your deductible and the insurance company will likely increase in your rates. Insurance adjusters will definitely believe the cops report before believing what you tell them.  So basically insurance just tries to screw you 100% of the time, lol.  No, not really. Over the years I've heard many stories from people who've been ""screwed"" by insurance companies when in reality the people complaining were partially at fault. Irishfields incident is an example of what I'm talking about. While the person who parked in the middle of the road is a complete idiot, the driver who rear ended the parked car could definitely be found partially at fault because he was traveling too fast for the conditions to be able to see the parked car and stop before hitting it. The only thing a dash cam would have shown in that situation was he was driving too fast for the conditions.    In just over 2 years we've been involved in 3 accidents and our rates have continued to drop with each renewal because we were found 0% at fault each time thanks to crystal clear stories, pictures, and witnesses. Dash cams would have helped each time by providing video evidence to show that the other drivers were flat out lying. Seeing as you're on the hook for your deductible if the other driver flees the scene and can't be identified, a dash cam would have saved me from paying my deductible after the one accident."

Was heading home from a walk with the kids and dog today and a white panel van shot right through a sideroad from my right to left without even slowing down. I came within a hairs breadth of t- boning him. First thing I thought of was this video.  So close....   It was the same damn sideroad where I had the incident last week in the whiteout.
840312,Joey,2014-03-08 04:26:00,9122,"Well hopefully only one more near miss MIke and you're in the clear!  Honestly, after watching that video and driving to work today, I was thinking, there are just soooo many bad drivers out there it is insane.  I mean what is wrong with people, why can't they be careful and pay attention?  l live just over 5 klicks from work and every single day I have to slam on my break, swerve to miss or do something evasive to save myself and my van from impact of some sort.  Today, for example, I'm in the left turning lane and across the intersection, someone is in that left turn lane.  Nobody coming straight so I start my turn.  Well the lady in the left turning lane on the other side decides, oh, I think I'll go straight instead so as I'm turning she starts coming straight at me and barely misses me and I can see her hands going up like I'm in the wrong.  The other day someone just decided they wanted to be in my lane without looking so I had to swerve and slam my brakes on, making sure I didn't hit anything or another car and every, single day someone pulls out of a gas station or side road in front of me when they clearly don't have the room to do so, making me slow down or literally stop.  It is very frustrating and I could go on, but I'm sure everyone here deals with the same on a daily basis.  What is the answer, I don't know but lives are at stake here and there's got to be a solution."
