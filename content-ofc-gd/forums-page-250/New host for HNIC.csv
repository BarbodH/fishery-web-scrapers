840645,Pikeslayer,2014-03-11 01:15:00,1443,It's all about the next generation/social media of hockey fans. Curious to know how many twitter followers Strombo vs McLean vs Cherry or anybody else on HNIC?
840650,Pigeontroller,2014-03-11 01:25:00,2793,More drivel from the NHL.  This has nothing to do with the NHL...
840661,HTHM,2014-03-11 02:15:00,4082,"Wow!!! One person posts something without all the facts and everyone jumps on the bandwagon like they been of that opinion forever. He's not replacing McLean. You're right, I did not have all the facts, I simply posted what information I had. However we have gotten a good discussion going now. Isn't that what is nice about this board?"
840673,SirCranksalot,2014-03-11 03:29:00,3291,Don Cherry is an idiot!!!
840700,jedimaster,2014-03-11 13:12:00,3472,"Don Cherry knows the game, the extra weird parts of his personality are just that. Weird. I rarely disagree with the actual hockey opinions he has. As for Strombo being on HNIC. I don't like it at all. It doesn't fit imo. I could think of a dozen people off hand I would rather here  and see on HNIC other than him. Actually if I started making a list I doubt he would even be on the list. No offense to him personally as I have met him a few times and some of my good friends are close to him. On HNIC though? No thanks."
840706,BucktownAngler,2014-03-11 14:17:00,582,I could think of a dozen people off hand I would rather here  and see on HNIC other than him.  do tell
840775,Steve,2014-03-11 22:54:00,2075,"Boss, ron mclean has been in hockey before he was on coaches corner.  where did you get that idea?"
840875,jimmer,2014-03-12 18:50:00,2730,Wasn't this a CBC decision? They're good at making the right decision! LOL
840878,kickingfrog,2014-03-12 19:00:00,8333,Rogers is calling the shots now. CBC will be involved for 4 more years but the Roger's contract is with the NHL for 10 years and they will decide who will be involved.
840936,HTHM,2014-03-13 01:04:00,4082,Here is 22 minutes take on the change: http://www.cbc.ca/22minutes/videos/clips-season-21/strombos-hockey-night-in-canada
841038,moxie,2014-03-13 16:09:00,1566,"What the hell??? I don't like this at all. Who is his partner gonna be? Justin Trudaeu? :rofl2:  ...... George ain't the guy. ""Nice guy"" just not ""The guy"". Justin on hockey? If his foray into politics have shown us anything thus far, he wouldn't be able to get many words out of his pie hole cause his foot would be firmly lodged in it most of the time. I'd almost wanna pay just to see it."
841042,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-13 17:16:00,2582,I actually think Strombo will do fine. Just something the hockey folks will have to warm up to.
841057,kickingfrog,2014-03-13 19:18:00,8333,I find it interesting how many hockey fans ate worried about someone who has zero to do with what they watch during the actual game. When do they get a beer and walk the dog?
840505,HTHM,2014-03-10 03:45:00,4082,"George Stroumboulopoulos  is going to be the next host of Hockey Night in Canada replacing Ron Maclean. From the Spectators web site: George Stroumboulopoulos will reportedly be the next host of Hockey Night in Canada. TSN reporter Bob McKenzie tweeted that the CBC host of George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight will become the face of the show when Rogers Communications Inc. takes control of Canada's NHL broadcasting rights next season.McKenzie also reports the Coach's Corner segment will continue another two years.A spokesperson for Sportsnet declined to confirm Stroumboulopoulos is the new host.McKenzie says Ron MacLean, who has hosted Hockey Night in Canada full-time since 1987, will still be involved with a reduced role.But he makes no mention of commentator Don Cherry, who has popularized Coach's Corner since first appearing on it in 1980.  Way to go Rogers!"
840506,BillM,2014-03-10 03:46:00,17367,"Is it April 1st yet?  If that's the case, I'm done watching Coaches Corner."
840507,porkpie,2014-03-10 04:35:00,2521,"pfft, strombo, no thanks.  way to ruin hockey!  coaches corner won't even be worth watching without Cherry and MacLean"
840508,John Bacon,2014-03-10 04:38:00,3277,"If ""Coach's"" Corner is going to continue for two more years; shouldn't they have an actual coach?"
840509,Gerritt,2014-03-10 05:00:00,6129,"Horrible choice, if indeed this is true..Might as well get rid of Coaches Corner all together.  G"
840510,davey buoy,2014-03-10 07:44:00,5505,Just can't leave a good thing alone can they?.Pretty bold move to change things up that much if true.

840527,glen,2014-03-10 13:46:00,2641,More drivel from the NHL.
840531,grimsbylander,2014-03-10 14:37:00,3016,How about Howie Meeker? He's is 90 years old and would still be better than George!
840534,jedimaster,2014-03-10 15:08:00,3472,Maybe Howie Mendel
840538,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-10 15:25:00,4399,Yes  those were the days!!!

840546,BucktownAngler,2014-03-10 15:55:00,582,dont understand the hate for strombo. hes just the host.  ron maclean didnt have a hockey background before hosting.   plus they announced ron & don will still be doing coaches corner.....so u can relax
840550,Squid,2014-03-10 16:17:00,1656,The hate is that Strombo is a HABS fan and the coachs corner was a lea leaning group just like the TSn and CBC crew. All for the laffs drink the pink koolaid!! LOL

840561,Hooked_On_Bass,2014-03-10 17:46:00,7,"I don't understand where Strombo will fit in? (He won't )  From the article: The outspoken and iconic Cherry, who has been featured on Hockey Night in Canada since 1980, will continue the tradition of Coach's Corner with MacLean as the duo jostle for elbow room — as well as the last word.  “I knew that Rogers would never mess with the greatest segment on television,"" Cherry said."
840574,kickingfrog,2014-03-10 18:47:00,8333,"Hey, I'm still not over Dave Hodge being canned. … Flips his pen and walks away.   What the heck is with the black on white????   I remember when Strombo was on the FAN590 (might have been before it was at 590???). He has done sports, but as the host knowledge of sports isn't really the highest priority. It's setting up after coming back from commercials, going to commercials, setting up guests and panelist. He will also interview some guests, he can do that. He won't be doing play-by-play so you can still watch the games."
