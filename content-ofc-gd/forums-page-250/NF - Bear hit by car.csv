841072,davey buoy,2014-03-13 21:17:00,5505,Man that was a hard hit.Wonder if he made it after the shock wore off?
841073,SuperDave,2014-03-13 21:18:00,204,Holy crap!
841077,atvaholic,2014-03-13 21:33:00,271,Doubt he made it through the night. Just my 2 cents.

841202,Tim Mills,2014-03-14 13:54:00,476,Lucky he didn't run out when first car was passing could have caused a bad accident.

841231,ch312,2014-03-14 16:21:00,1590,"I`d say the bear likely died after that. Many hit animals will run a short distance before either dropping dead or laying down to bleed out. But, I guess it`s possible his rear end took the brunt of it and protected his vitals.   Who knows, maybe he got lucky?"
