842044,bushart,2014-03-19 16:19:00,2628,Yeah...I was asked to help a team with some bass ideas that had entered that tourney  Definitely some honker smallies in there  My buddy does really well on Rainy in the fall for Willy's
841808,manitoubass2,2014-03-18 02:54:00,11391,"Well i had to go get rid of that 2oz walleye that landed me a derby win, lol. So me and a great bud headed out on to rainy lake. Day started with getting the truck stuck. A few phone calls and we got out okay. But change of game plans as the drifts wouldn't allow us to drive out. So we check navionics and change the game plan.  Drill ten holes 400 yards offshore on what we agree looks like promising grounds. Payed off big time! First fish 5 mins in, 17.5"" keeper. We marked fish like crazy, big ones too!  We alternated holes and continued to absolutely hammer walleye from 16.5"" to 26"". Missed a few at the hole but luckily dove in to catch them haha. All fish but one came on buckshot jigging spoons in orange/yellow tipped with frozen shiners. One fish came on a deadsticked jig. Amazing day, great time!  I'm waiting for him to send my pics, but here are a few in the meantime:)my keeps for the day!"
841809,manitoubass2,2014-03-18 02:56:00,11391,Oops sorry for the double pic. Here's another

841814,manitoubass2,2014-03-18 03:38:00,11391,A few more
841817,manitoubass2,2014-03-18 04:20:00,11391,"One awesome thing that i seen twice today was BIG pike swoop in from just under the ice to 20 fow to hammer fish i was jigging up! On one hand it sucked, on the other hand it was awesome to see. Those pike were hammering 18"" walleye on my video game screen, so cool. Wish i had the gopro through ice to tape it. Oh well maybe next time"

842025,bushart,2014-03-19 12:09:00,2628,Yup  Sometimes it's all about makin lemonade when your given lemons  years ago my son and I were in a bass tourney----long story short-----started into the day---I hit a rock with my prop and mangled it really good.  We could still move but like 2mph tops  Well I told him (who was very dis-heartened) that we'd keep fishin and stay put and try and make the best of it---well a couple hours before weigh in-----we started catchin huge smallies-------I gave us enough time to limp into the weigh in  Guess who won? Including Big fish of the tourney  I'm thinkin that had my prop been good----probably would not have stayed in that spot
842028,manitoubass2,2014-03-19 12:26:00,11391,
842029,bushart,2014-03-19 12:43:00,2628,PS  I was gonna start a Pro-Staff Tourney team--- With past tourney winners---but the bar was set with your last win at 3oz  Just kiddin Dude  Nice catch on Rainy---I fished that lake years ago but for a pre-fish for that big bass tourney outta the Fort
842040,manitoubass2,2014-03-19 15:34:00,11391,"Hahaha. Hey thats cool, fort frances bass championship is a pretty big event around here. Always a good time. Rainy lake is awesome, i love fishing it. NW bay is about a 35 minute drive from my house, so we fish there quite often. Even up to the cascades or porters inlet. Big lake, lotsa big fish"
