839329,Gerritt,2014-03-02 19:46:00,6129,"Welcome from just down the ""bore01"" from you. I live In Brighton and work in Belleville, I also drive to Kingston often to hit up Costco and to visit the best crappy tire I have ever been in.... I had no idea crappy tires had giant fish tanks at their gun counters until I visited the one in Kingston. It's a sweet location.  If your ever in quinte and I am free send me a pm  G."
839506,akaShag,2014-03-03 20:09:00,2073,"Thanks for the welcomes, folks.  Looks like a great site!Doug"
840880,akaShag,2014-03-12 19:01:00,2073,"OK I have been here a few weeks now and have learned a few things:1.  Most of the folks here are polite and respectful of each other's opinions.  2.  To see where number 1 is not necessarily true, follow threads about Conservation Officers and/or Lake Nipissing.  3.  My machine will not let me use the QUOTE button, nor can I make any ""hot link"" button work.  (yet...)  4.  When I enable html for a response, the spaces that I carefully insert for reading clarity disappear.  So far, so good, but I really do need to figure out some of these computer glitches.  Doug"
840895,aplumma,2014-03-12 20:29:00,6896,Doug please post what you are doing to quote as well as what operating system you are using. I would suggest you download Chrome and try to use the features it seems to be one of the easier glitch free programs. We are aware that IE is not friendly and as they change there versions it has been problematic at best. You can also start a thread in the Computer section and others will be happy to help you.

840901,akaShag,2014-03-12 20:42:00,2073,"Thanks Art.  I am using Windows 7 Professional, and do not have these problems with quite a number of other Internet sites....  When I push the ""Quote"" button on  a post that I would like to quote, essentially nothing happens, and it does not show up in my reply box, neither on the first page nor on a ""more reply options"" page.  I can cut and paste by enabling html on the latter page, but then the text appears with no spaces.  And on a hot button, usually I get a little yellow star with an ""X"" in it (which leads me to think it is a pop-up blocker problem).  That one I think I can fix if I fart around with it long enough................  Ah, the heady challenges of an Internet Adventurer!  Doug"

839039,moxie,2014-02-28 19:08:00,1566,Welcome aboard Doug.
838548,akaShag,2014-02-26 18:41:00,2073,"Well, if there is an ""introductions"" forum or thread I missed it, and I have been hijacking other threads (notably Tyler's Derby pictures) for newbie questions and comments.  So my real name is Doug, but that user name was already taken here.  And my old nickname is Shag, so I went with akaShag (aka = ""also known as"")  I am retired old fart and have been fishing for over fifty years.  I am happy wetting a line for practically any species, but I did have a spell when I was a fairly dedicated steelhead addict, and have been known to pursue bass with some enthusiasm.  I unapologetically keep some fish to EAT and consider fresh fish to be one of the great benefits of the sport.  You want to practice C&R, go right ahead, but please don't slam me when I keep a feed of crappies or perch (or whatever).  I moved around a bit with my career but now call Kingston home and I like it here.  Yes that is my picture in the avatar, taken during a road trip I took in 2011 when I fished and hunted my way to the Yukon and back.  It was a great trip (and I did it solo).  I have friends in every province and territory, and several states, and like to visit them and share fishing and hunting adventures.  My big trip this year will be to Great Slave Lake with a couple buddies, one of whom lives in Yellowknife and has all the kit we will need.  I hope to bring a ""mature"" perspective to this site.  So far I like the tone (as in, NOT rude!) and I see some friends both old and new amongst the membership.  I look forward to being able to figure out some of the technological problems I am having, but did not grow up with computers and admit to some technophobia.  Now back to regular programming, and I promise to hijack less threads.   OK once more on the Tyler thread to link here, if I can make the machine do that.......  Doug "
838557,davey buoy,2014-02-26 19:43:00,5505,Good to see you jumped on board!Your input is more than welcome.
838568,12footspringbok,2014-02-26 20:21:00,459,"Nice reading your input Doug. That is some impressive hair you had there, I hope to grow a beard that impressive one day, but I think the one I have now will be gone once the ice and snow leaves. I read your comment in the Tyler thread, about getting out on Simcoe. I certainly don't guide but would be game to hook up and giver' out there any day.  Martin"
838573,akaShag,2014-02-26 20:38:00,2073,"Thanks Martin!  It would be good to meet up again, it has been a while...........  Do you still have a snowmobile that does a hundred miles an hour?  Doug"
838576,12footspringbok,2014-02-26 21:10:00,459,No doug I had another sled that would do 110 mph   until I sold it last night... Still have my other  sled though (old Betsey) that carries all my ice fishing gear and hut in tow at a decent speed.

838590,NAW,2014-02-26 22:07:00,4022,Sounds like your going to be a great addition to OFC Doug!  You should post up some pics from your past trips!  We love fish porn here...
838591,Big Cliff,2014-02-26 22:20:00,6899,"Well Doug, I have to tell you if that really is a picture of you, you have a double named Dennis (my first wife ran away with him and he's been trying to bring her back for over 30 years now). All kidding aside (and I am serious about the double) Welcome to the board! There are several of us old farts on here that were brought up in the days when fishing and hunting were for food not for sport as it is today.  I still carry a lot of the old values with me; don't take more than you can use and if you do get more then you share it. Always give a man a hand up rather than a hand out, Well from the posts I have seen so far we share a lot of the same ideals! I hope we get an opportunity to share some time together this year! I'm up on Sturgeon Lake in the Kawarthas, if you are ever inclined to head this way give me a shout!"

838593,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-26 22:31:00,8243,"As a junior member here I know you won't be disappointed with the tone and membership here. No trollers and people acting like babies. There are disagreements here like everywhere and usually never get silly. I would love to read and see more about the cross country trek, sounds fantastic. Is there a book and eventually a movie in the works?. Grissley Adams could play you but he's too old and may not even be alive today.  I lost my cat a few years back, take a look in your beard and let me know if you find it. I don't use acronyms or smiley faces, if I say something stupid I may be trying to be funny or are saying something stupid.  Welcome."
838612,akaShag,2014-02-26 23:46:00,2073,"Thanks folks.  No cats in my beard although there have been other things and since this is a G-rated site we won't go there.  I did eat cougar a couple times of course, both times the four legged variety and found it surprisingly good.  I had believed that people hunted cougars for sport and trophies only (like grizzly bears), but cougar meat is delicious!  And I did hear, last time I was in the Yukon, that ""some"" folks do eat grizzly bear meat, but that is very rare indeed because most grizzlies live on carrion and the rotten flesh they eat imparts a similar flavour to their flesh.  Apparently, I do not know...................and have zero intention of finding out unless somebody offers me some when I have seen them eating it already and from the same pot!  I wrote a blog while I was on my trip, and that is basically most of the writing I plan to do about that.  Back when Darryl Choronzey had the Ontario Fisherman magazine, I did write for him on a freelance basis and that was fun...........  Doug"

Kind of like skateboarding but it is much slower and thankfully does not usually involve broken kneecaps and black eyes.............so where was I again?  Oh, yes..........the Science Centre...........  Yes you are correct, that is indeed the Van De Graaf Generator look, I thought it was pretty awesome myself.  When you build up a sufficient static charge, however, you want to be exceptionally careful just what part of your body is sticking out, if you catch my drift, because that is where the shock comes aboard.  On most websites, posting pictures involves incantations and black magic that I have not yet mastered, only having attended my first three years at Hogwarts before they threw me out.
