841455,leaf4,2014-03-15 23:15:00,2466,"Hey all, in the coming months I'm more than likely going to be looking into a newer car, along with that I'm not going to want to car top my scanoe so I'm going to want to do a trailer setup for it.  Does anyone have any experience in either the fabrication or know of a suitable reasonably priced trailer?  I've found one online for a steal at $400, but it's only available in the states and doesn't ship to PO boxes unfortunately.  http://www.harborfreight.com/600-lb-capacity-boat-trailer-with-8-inch-wheels-and-tires-5002.html  I have welding experience and can do the fabrication but to be honest I'd probably spend more than $400 on the materials to put one together which is a shame.  Thanks for any input anyone has to give it will be much appreciated, Lucas"
841464,skdds,2014-03-15 23:48:00,195,Perhaps try Marine Cradle shop in Sutton..need to google details and for website. I'm working on a similar project for a Kayak and they were helpful when I spoke with them..skdds

841479,porkpie,2014-03-16 00:50:00,2521,"I wouldn't go the trailer route for a scanoe either, but if your set on it, there is a harbour freight just across the border near the walden galleria mall.  You could probably ship to store for pickup if they dont have it in stock.  You could also send it to US adress in niagra falls.  I have gear delivered there from time to time for $5 a package!"
841484,leaf4,2014-03-16 01:31:00,2466,"thanks for the input everyone! It won't be a decision I make anytime soon, but I will mull over everyone's advice. the reason I'm looking into it is more or less I'll more than likely get a sedan (looking at elantras) and currently owning a protege 5 the car topping is easy with the space available with it being a hatchback and I'm a bit unsure of how I will like driving with it on a sedan with a small roof surface. thanks again everyone appreciate the advice  Lucas"
841499,trevy727,2014-03-16 02:21:00,351,Install a roof rack.
841503,leaf4,2014-03-16 02:32:00,2466,"Yeah I have one for my protege 5 but don't use it for anything other than my snowboard, the beam on my canoe is 48"" so it's actually about as wide as the roof is, but the rails that the rack clips into come in a couple inches each side so it actually goes over my racks and such is the way with most unless I was to go about adding extensions myself or get a Thule that extends a bit past each side but then I'm probably looking at spending $400 on the roof racks lol, even buying used those things hold their value"

841530,solopaddler,2014-03-16 12:33:00,8605,Why a specialized trailer like that? A simple box trailer will suffice. Added bonus being you can put your gear in it and free up space in the car.  Slickest way to handle a canoe is to weld a small rack onto the frame like this:      
841531,Tim Mills,2014-03-16 12:50:00,476,The added benefit  of either trailer mentioned is that you can launch by yourself.  Scanoes are awkward and difficult to get on and off a roof rack by yourself.
841536,akaShag,2014-03-16 13:22:00,2073,"back to Fisherman, guilty as charged.  Although the time that BOTH wheel bearings blew out, and molten bits of bearings shredded BOTH my tires, I had loaned my big boat to Marcel for the open water season.  Seems he was fond of launching ""Watchdog"" and leaving the trailer in the water at the ramp while he got rigged etc........  And Marcel is harder on equipment than I will ever be.................  The fact remains that a trailer is another thing that can go wrong, especially if a person is technically inept like me.............  Doug"
841537,leaf4,2014-03-16 13:24:00,2466,"That was also a concern, if my memory serves me, my scanoe weighs around 110lbs. So during the loading unloading process in certain situations I may be a little weary of the well being of my paint LOL, that box trailer with the brackets is a possibility too.  Just wondering what sort of length I should look for if going that route being that my scanoe is 16'. that was my main reason for looking at that one from harbor freight, I like the idea of it being a more fixed placement on the trailer"
841538,Sinker,2014-03-16 13:33:00,8692,"Id be looking for a box trailer too. It will come in handy for lots of other things, as well as the canoe.  S."
841546,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-16 14:47:00,2582,Although I never owned a canoe I drove  VW golfs since 1986 and have always had a box trailer. It has paid for itself many times over with all the stuff I have hauled in it. Racks on a box trailer would be the route I would be looking to go.
841551,davey buoy,2014-03-16 15:14:00,5505,"I have a 8'x40"" box trailer.Paid for itself many times over as mentioned.When I had the canoe,strapped it on top,and put the rest of the gear in the trailer.Made the sides 2' high.It's the way to go if you have the room to store it.Good luck!"

A lot of roof racks do not provide enough clearance for canoes.  I took some 4"" PVC and wrapped in outdoor carpet.  They are now about 8"" in diameter and prevent the canoe from contacting the roof."
841640,SBCregal,2014-03-16 22:35:00,688,you wont even have to rig anything up.  theres a product just like johnbacon was describing.  http://www.extendatruck.com
841644,solopaddler,2014-03-16 22:59:00,8605,"you wont even have to rig anything up.  theres a product just like johnbacon was describing.  http://www.extendatruck.com  I had something very similar made for my old shortbox Toyota pickup back in the day.  Nice thing about mine the T-bar swiveled and was locked in place with a pin. With the pin pulled loading was a breeze. Just place the nose of the canoe into the T-bar grab the other end of the canoe and swivel it around to the truck cab, foam blocks in place already. Reverse process for unloading.  A local welding shop made mine for around $60 and it was 10x more heavy duty than anything commercially available."
841687,Entropy,2014-03-17 02:38:00,747,you have my vote for the box trailer with the racks.  you will use it more than you can imagine.
