There's virtually no snow cover left and with tonights temps it's going to be something between a skating and curling rink out there.  No cooling for liquid cooled sled and track sliders.  Walkers would be smart to bring cleats or golf shoes.   That's if anyone is going to brave the retarded cold temps tomorrow.

It was a bit cold (-16), little wind,but toasty warm in the hub enjoting  hot chocolate and tim bits.  . Walking was great on the bay here. Packed up,cuz the divers were sawing a hole 50 ft from us.   For a 3 year old,she did well and she loved watching the finder. Once she got the hang of it,she loved watching the fish chase here jig. No hook ups but she had fun."
