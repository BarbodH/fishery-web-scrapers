841288,Joeytier,2014-03-14 23:48:00,3990,This was me and Chad's hell Tuesday AM...I shudder at the sight of this photo...  
841289,NAW,2014-03-14 23:53:00,4022,NOT fun!!  That pic brings back some horrible memories...
841290,BillM,2014-03-15 00:03:00,17367,"Reminds me of trout opener on Joe last year, lol."
841316,Moosebunk,2014-03-15 02:30:00,3970,Blaaaaah!  Remember getting the Bravo bogged down in slush like that while giving a pregnant woman in early labor a lift to the hospital.  I had to kick her off and make her walk with wet boots the last few hundred meters along the riverbank.  Her phat arse off the back I got the sled out and off the water. lol.  NAW said it... No fun.

Stompin' Tom could have made a song about that I'm sure!

841338,Joey,2014-03-15 03:24:00,9122,Reminds me of a video I made a few years ago  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVoFL_JakaE
841340,BillM,2014-03-15 03:34:00,17367,"Joey, that looks miserable, lol."
841348,Nipfisher,2014-03-15 06:54:00,2449,That's what you guys get for chasing Trout. Walleye lakes are all solid.
841351,Joeytier,2014-03-15 09:26:00,3990,Blair we hammered the specks though...NOT!  Bunk if I had a bravo there'd be nothing to complain about....just pick er up and be done with it
841358,Rod Caster,2014-03-15 12:17:00,5784,The slush was garbage. The fishing was garbage.  Luckily the weather was nice.
