I was able to score some new Taildancers, Manns Stretch +25, A Storm Lure and some new Husky Jerks.Laker John made a real score on a Lindy Drift Sock as well as stocking his tackle box with a bunch of Smithwicks (can never have too many of these in the box  :roll: )After the show we headed to the County to check out the ice conditions. First stop was the Wellington Ramp - a big pile of  snow and FYI - the LCBO is closed there......A walk on the dock beside the Swans and Ducks and Geese.A quick drive to Beach Road to see beach.......OMGIt will take some warm weather and favourable winds to knock down the 7-9 feet of ice built up against the shore. As Grizzly said looks like 80 - 100 yards off the top of the beach.Well, we know we won't be going there for a a couple weeks or more.  Headed off towards Sandbanks and the Salmon Point Road to have a gaze at Athol Bay --- OMG!!!!!!And looking across towards West Point this is what you see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are some blocks of ice off the shore that appear to be 8 to 10 feet high, they're 75 yards off the shore.Are we gonna need some heat and soon...................We are really hoping that we will be able to get the boat out and over to the county in April.Not being very optimistic about the weather with cold forecast til the end of the month  Stay Tuned.David  aka  SuperdadPS  To see a larger image, double click- takes you to my Photobucket Album"

841658,Joey,2014-03-17 00:01:00,9122,"Yup, there sure is alot of ice this year.  Don't expect a warm summer if the ice is that thick on the lakes.  They will probably stay pretty cold, making it colder all around.  Just my opinion though, hope I'm wrong,"
