Bamboo  The following is an interesting read, it's a diary of a Mark IV Carp rod he has recently finished.  Part 1  Part 2  Enjoy!"
83289,Zib,2007-06-13 16:06:00,369,"It's funny that you posted this. Just last night I was watching the cable show ""How it's made"" & they were making rods just like this. Interesting stuff. I think they said it took anywhere from 40 to 80 hours to make them."
83294,wolfville,2007-06-13 16:23:00,396,"May I ask.....how much is that 10' Mark IV carp rod? Not that I can afford it... And to match a rod like that you need to get a vintage reel from the 50'.  After watching a few video of Chris Yates, I've been wanting to try one out.... at least in my dreams."
83755,fishnsled,2007-06-14 16:17:00,3520,"Hey Zib - I wish I had seen that episode.  Would have been cool to watch.  Wolfville - Malcolm started off doing it as a hobbie,  in fact it still is.  He does a few of rods a year and that is it.  Mainly for himself and friends.  Doesn't want it to cut into his fishing time or to become a second job.  Because of some postings on a couple of boards showing the work he does, he has be asked by a few people to make either rods or wading staffs.  As for costs it varies on the rod and how much time goes into it. As Zib said it is 40-80 hours.   If I remember correctly the Mark IV went for $1000.  I've heard of bamboo rods hitting the $5000 mark depending of who has made it.  I've got a 4 weight fly rod that Malcolm made for me a few years ago and I just had to pay for the supplies.  Very good friend I'd say."
