83552,Mark.O,2007-06-14 07:03:00,15,"Heya all,  So tomorrow I have no work, no plans and nothing to worry about. So i'm going fishing. Now, the problem is finding a place to go fishing. I live in Mississauga so I try to stay in a 50 km radius from where I live, which pretty much means the GTA area (or Halton region). I've been to the Toronto Islands plenty of times fishing for pike, been to Guelph lake twice with little success, to Fairy lake in Acton twice now, and to the dam near Wild Water Kingdom with little success. It's not bass season yet so i'm not going after any bass but I do want to go pike fishing. And I want to try a new location.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me? Or am I better off staying with the locations I have now?  Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.  Thanks alot  - Mark  (p.s I'm stuck fishing from shore since I don't have a boat)"

83594,jediangler,2007-06-14 11:18:00,1923,Are you limited to shore fishing or do you have access to a boat?

83662,Fishmaster,2007-06-14 13:40:00,920,Grand River lots of Walleye & Perch right now ..
83720,Mark.O,2007-06-14 15:29:00,15,Where abouts on the Grand River is the walleye located?
83724,Jen,2007-06-14 15:37:00,833,I tend to agree with Fishmaster and snoil... The Grand River is definately the place to go...
83746,Mark.O,2007-06-14 16:05:00,15,What about Bluffer's Park? Anyone ever heard anything about the fishing there? Apparently Pike and Walleye are possible there?
83863,Weeds,2007-06-14 19:10:00,782,I've fished Bluffers Park alot of times before and never caught squat. I too was targetting pike there. I've seen a few bass and carp there but never seen anybody catch anything. It's also pretty weedy fishing. I think you could probably do better.
