We need somewhere in the Iron Bridge or Blind River area to catch some walleye this year.  Could anyone give me some ideas where to go and what to use.  Sorry for the late post but we have yet to catch any walleye up there.  Thanks for the help!!  Shane Fort Wayne, IN"

That's a little farther East from the area you're talking about but I would guess that the Mississauga River by Blind River is giving them up as well.  The Mississauga flows through Iron Bridge as well.  If I was looking for walleye, I'd look for deeper holes in the river and drift a jig and worm or go-getter and worm.  Other than the big tribs that flow into Huron, this is more of a trout area.  Some of the lakes up through the Blind River system have some walleye as well."
