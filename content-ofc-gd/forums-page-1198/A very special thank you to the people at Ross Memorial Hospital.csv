83735,Big Cliff,2007-06-14 15:48:00,6899,"Ahhh, thanks for all the kind and encouraging replies! It means a lot!  I don't know about Lacair, I see the surgeon on Monday afternoon and he will let me know then what I can or can't do. Right now just getting in and out of a car is quite uncomfortable, I have no idea what a 4+ hour drive would be like for me. I guess I'll just have to play that one by ear.  As for the fishing.... well, as long as I don't try to bend over to net anything I should be OK, I may give it a try tonight."
83742,Entropy,2007-06-14 15:58:00,747,"Yikes, how quickly things turn bad, eh.  Glad to hear all worked out well."
83745,motv8tr,2007-06-14 16:01:00,2587," Well Cliff it would really stink if you couldn't make it....you would would be missed greatly.....but I certainly would understand it.  I hope you're feeling up to it, but if not, I'll try to find my way to your place at some point.  I will have Sundays off for the summer.  Maureen"

83988,Loonietoon,2007-06-15 01:21:00,1450,Glad all went well Cliff...   But ha What a way to get a back rub
83989,Marty,2007-06-15 01:25:00,873,Kudos to the hospital and its great to hear you're doing well Cliff.
83998,Nanook,2007-06-15 01:49:00,565," Good to hear all went well Cliff,smart move going to Emerg. Great places when ya need 'em.  After my Hernia fix, they said ,no heavy lifting also. Even told me to sit down for a pee  Take it easy and get well soon."
84091,Spiel,2007-06-15 10:32:00,9065,....Well that's a hell of way to spend the weekend. Glad it all turned out for the good Cliff and that you're now on the mend.
83692,Bly,2007-06-14 14:36:00,1556,Not exactly how you planned to spend the evening/night I am sure!!   Glad to hear that you are all fixed up and about the good treatment by the staff     Speedy recovery!!!   Bly
83706,Flyboy,2007-06-14 15:06:00,26,"Hi Cliff,  Good to hear you received the royal treatment at the hospital. I think the system is great when you're actually in it. It's just the wait that's not acceptable. I agree the nurses make the huge difference. The practicing ones from the college/university are the most accommodating and are not jaded or burnt out from the heavy workload yet.  God speed in your healing. I hope the fishing rod is not too heavy to use in your condition  Flyboy"
83714,bigbuck,2007-06-14 15:19:00,2449,"Ouch Cliff!! My father in law dealt with that last summer when we went up to Kenora to visit. However, they did not operate on him for 2 weeks and he had a couple of very painful attacks along with a couple of hours each time in the emergency for us and a couple of overnight stays. The surgeon was so booked that even with something that serious, dad had to wait for the surgery. Be thankful that we live in Southern Ontario where there are quite a few hospitals and doctors around. In Northern Ontario, it's a different story. I hope you have a speedy recovery."
83716,fishnsled,2007-06-14 15:23:00,3520,Speedy recovery Cliff.  Good thing you didn't put it off much longer.  Take it easy and enjoy the pampering.
83718,motv8tr,2007-06-14 15:26:00,2587,"Glad you got it all fixed up Cliff, glad they took you in so quick, didn't give you enough time to get good and worried about it.  How's Sue doing?  Was she ready to put you back in the hospital for not calling her and letting her know what was happening...I know I would have  .  Ya know, this could be someones way of telling you you are not taking enough time to fish....so hopefully you'll still make it up to Lakair and say hello, and spend some time fishing off your dock would ya  Take care Maureen"
