83135,fishdawg,2007-06-13 03:23:00,912,hot rumor is that Dale is going to sign on with Hendrick's next season! I am a huge Hendricks (and Jr.) fan  - hoping that none of the chemistry/momentum that the team currently haswill get lost if this happens - and who woulndt want to see Dale finally drink champagne after Homestead one year?

No number yet ,and not sure about Budwisier coming with him.  This is where loyalty has to come in.   I hope to watch the whole announcement on my PC when I get home."

83684,bowshep,2007-06-14 14:24:00,378,"Ah Carp. l'm not a Jr. fan. Jr has no dedication behind the wheel and if he wasn't holding his fathers cape he would be pushing a wheel Barrel. Gordan has been pushed down from the fan's for a long time about having a silver spoon, like Jr. is poor, or when Gorden won a championship by haveing a car to go around the track for a lap (l would have done the same thing) Well l have no say so here we go.  Peace Ken"
