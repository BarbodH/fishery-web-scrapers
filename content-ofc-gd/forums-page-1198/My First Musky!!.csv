83124,Weeds,2007-06-13 02:33:00,782,"Well, I managed to catch my first musky this evening, so as you can imagine I'm pretty pumped. I was chucking around a slopmaster of all things when it hit and I immediately started yelling musky, musky! I knew it wasn't a a bass but for a split second I was disappointed because it occured to me that I might have somehow foulhooked a carp as there are tons here. Even when it broke the surface I still wasn't convinced because after what must be close to that 10000 cast number you start to think you are never going to get one. It wasn't  all that big by musky standards, maybe 36"" tops and lean,  and it probably looks smaller than that in the pic  because I was too busy trying to keep it from hurting itself (or me) to pose with it arms extended but it was really awesome nonetheless. From start to finish, hooked, landed, photoed and released must of been  3 minutes tops.  Swam away as strong as it came in. Really cool to know that you can get them without a boat too. Thanks both to all those on this board who have given me advice either directly or indirectly and to all the local anglers who unselfishly pointed me in the right direction. I have a crappy cell phone pic which I'll post once I figure out how. "

83454,dsn,2007-06-13 23:05:00,1018,Ahh nice going weeds.  Can't wait to see the pic.  dsn
83530,Kev,2007-06-14 03:32:00,54,Congrats on your first musky Weeds
83531,Carp,2007-06-14 03:47:00,1488,Nice going dude.  Congrats.
83733,bigbuck,2007-06-14 15:45:00,2449,Congrats on losing your cherry!!! I guess that the local tackle shops will be seeing more of you over the next while as you have been bitten by the BUG!!! I hope you catch tons more.
83741,lew,2007-06-14 15:56:00,12767,"Congrats on your 1st ever musky.  The 1st one is always the hardest to catch, it gets alot easier from now on !!"
83759,fishnsled,2007-06-14 16:22:00,3520,Great job there Weeds!  Congrats!
83954,hydro,2007-06-14 23:31:00,24,Hey man thats a great first ski!  Gotta love the colors.  Youre hooked now - man that green is beaut!
84198,Rizzo,2007-06-15 16:42:00,4754,"well done!  Lew is exactly right.  Next one won't be as tough to find.  I took 4 straight days on GBay with nothing when I first started musky fishing, then went to Nipissing and caught 2 in a day!  Keep at it and you'll get your hours down."
