I was drifting Berkley Power Trout worms and I managed to track down some resident bows but couldn't seem to get any takers.  As if getting skunked wasn't bad enough, one bow decided to mock me:  After a few drifts didn't seem to spark the interest of the above mentioned bow, it retreated to an undercut bank. I tried a few more drifts close to the bank but ended up getting hung up on an overhead branch. Since it was obvious that the bow wasn't interested i waded into the creek to untangle my line rather than breaking it. I figured that would scare the bow away but it didn't even move when i was standing only 2 feet or so away!! I couldn't believe that a fish that is so known for being easily spooked would just sit there so after a minute or so of marvaling I tapped it with my rod tip which finally made it move... about 4 feet. haha. I just lauged to myself and left the ""bad ass"" of all bows for another day.  I just thought I'd share this story because I still can't believe it happened!  If anyone has any ideas on what to use to coax such picky resident bows into biting I would appreciate it."
