83786,tonyb,2007-06-14 17:35:00,1637,"I don't think they have coverage of Nippissing, unless they have released it recently.  Garmin Bluecharts do provide coverage.    Tony"
83791,Roy,2007-06-14 17:38:00,13728,Lew it's in the Hotmaps section.
83792,lew,2007-06-14 17:39:00,12767,"Thanks Tony, but I understand Navionics has come out with it this year, although I believe it only covers the waters east of 64"

83797,Roy,2007-06-14 17:42:00,13728,"Yes Lew, I was told the same thing."
83801,keram,2007-06-14 17:45:00,585,On the NDI charts (Digital Ocean NW14) Lake Nippising is split in three sections:  Chart 6035 Eastern Chart 6057 Iron  Island to west bay Chart 6058 West bay to west arm
83802,tonyb,2007-06-14 17:47:00,1637,Yep you're right (Good to know too!)  Map Code: PREM-C3  http://www.navionics.com/PremiumLakeList_07.asp?RegionID=5  Tony
83837,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-14 18:30:00,655,"Yep, you got it.. Hotmaps.  I have the new Hotmaps Premium card, and it is awesome!  Most in-land Canadian lakes I fish that I never thought would be available with Navionics are on that card.   I can't live without Navionics cards.  They allow me to fish new watersheds with confidence!  Cheers,  Aaron"
83894,Guest lundboy,2007-06-14 20:39:00,0,"  This is true.  It does NOT cover Nippissing west of 64....  So if you want it for Lakeair,  it won't do it.  Great coverage for the rest of Nippissing though."
