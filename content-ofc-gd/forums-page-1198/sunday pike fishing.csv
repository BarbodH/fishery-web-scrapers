83036,pikeie,2007-06-12 23:48:00,380,"well after some helpful tips and pointers on fishing lake couchiching. tinbanger my bro and i decided to give lake couch our best shot. got up nice and early and off to the lake we go. get to the launch around 7:00 and out fishing as quick as we could.  so we start off fishing a nice weed flat in 10-14 feet of water and i got a hit on a inline spiner, not the fish we were after but it was a nice 11-12"" perch lol, keep fishing that spot and not one pike seen. we move over and start fishing a shoreline and only seen 2 bullheads, water was getting a bit to warm for the pike i think.  so we take a bit of a ride over to a spot were i was told would produce, first few cast out and i got a very large pike following my spinner bait it sat under the boat just looking at the bait but wouldnt hit then took off that was one pain in the @ss. the fish was definatly close to 40"" long. 1 cast later my bro gets a follow but agian it wouldnt hit. fish the rest of that spot with no sucess and after a troll by that spot we went decided to go to a spot on simcoe we always have some luck at, this was more just to avoid a skunk then anything else lol.  we got to our pike spot and there were 5 boats there   lol. so we start fishing and guess what..... NO FISH lol. so while everyone is fishing shallow water we move out deeper into some colder water and we are still getting no fish. we all agrie to head over to the other side of the bay, electric moter turned on high i grab a sndwhich and by bro throughs out his spoon and right away bam fish on. he first thought he hooked a bass because it woasnt fighting like a pike but then it jumped out of the water and it was a nice pike. after a nice fight and almost loseing it under the boat i got the net under it and then we saw it was a very nice size fish. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691648  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691673 the fis was very beat up and had some open wounds on it.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691719  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691747 the fish measured out to 37"" his and our biggest by far. his still doesnt feel comfertable holding bigger pike  here are some release shots  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691831  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691874  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1181691893  so for our only fish of the day it sure was a nice one."
