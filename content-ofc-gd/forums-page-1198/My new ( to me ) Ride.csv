83095,Dondorfish,2007-06-13 01:30:00,1000,"Well after humming and hawing and looking around, I finally broke down and gave in to temptation. For at least 20 years I have wanted to get an Islander and I figured now was as good a time as any - so with some help from my buddy skeeter, we were off to Ottawa on Saturday to water test the boat and tow it back to Peterborough. It will stay docked in Peterborough for the rest of the summer and then be taken down to Quinte for the fall fishing . I had posted requesting info on the Islander and got lots of good reviews - so I figured what the heck! Only down side to the new boat is that my wife is making me sell the Tracker! ( It will be posted soon in the clasified section ) - I was hoping to keep it here in Niagara to fish during the week, but she had other plans! I will definately be sad to see it sold - been a great boat, but I really wanted something bigger. As far as towing - My Rav 4 ( 270 hp ) handled the job with flying colours - as my buddy skeeter will atest to. The boats name is  "" Playin Hookey "" . Drop by and say hello if you see me out there!   Don"
83096,silveradosheriff,2007-06-13 01:32:00,1025,Sweet ride - you'll have plenty of years enjoyment!

MTP
83107,fishindevil,2007-06-13 02:06:00,6254,"Looks great don,im sure you will enjoy fishing/sleeping overnight in it,too bad about the tracker though,it was a good trade off....cheers"
83108,skeeter,2007-06-13 02:08:00,1907,and a sweet ride it is!! and shiny as the day it was built. hey tracker/islander if i buy your tracker can i keep it in your drive way ?????? 
83110,LipDip,2007-06-13 02:12:00,39,Awesome rig man! But you'll be shopping for a new truck this time next year after towing that baby with any regularity/distances with a Rav 4 I can almost guarantee you.
83113,PERCHER,2007-06-13 02:18:00,787,"Don that is one nice boat.You could be out on Qunte when others are shore bound due to weather,Heck you will even save money on a motel room.If you need a first mate in the fall let me know.Best of luck with your new ride.Dan"
83207,tipupesox,2007-06-13 12:30:00,167,"Being an Islander owner myself, enjoy your new ride."
83211,JFR,2007-06-13 12:35:00,498,"Sweet boat, enjoy it. But I agree with Lip Dip, consider upgrading your tow vehicle."
83214,pikehunter,2007-06-13 12:36:00,1659,"Nice boat. Should be very comfortable and the saving on accommodations will more than cover the fuel costs as I think you may be using a little more with this boat. Be nice to fish from in damp weather.  As said, be careful pulling it with a Rav4, it might seem like the tail is wagging the dog if you catch an unexpected wind gust the wrong way."
83234,Joey,2007-06-13 13:26:00,9122,That will be something you will enjoy for a long time I'm sure.  Very nice indeed.  Joey
83335,bpsbassman,2007-06-13 17:22:00,941,Congrats Don. I can totally relate to your feelings about the old Tracker.  Great boats.  I'll be seeing my old one this weekend up at Dalrymple.
