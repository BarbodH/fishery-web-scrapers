After we decided to call it quits, they invited us for BBQ, which was a really nice treat.  After dinner, as we were just sitting back ejoying a couple of cool ones and relaxing in his backyard, my wife mentions that she has the day off on Tuesday.  Almost instantly and jokingly, I replied ""great, then I am going fishing"".  The look on Puckheads face was priceless, and although I don't think our wives took this suggestion seriously, there was no indication of any sort of objection.  I look at Puckhead, he looks at me, and then its ""so what time do you want to go?"".  I guess at that stage our wives figured it was too late to say anything, and so on Tuesday, off we went.  I picked up Puckhead at 0430, and after one pitstop for coffee, we had our lines in the water by 0630.  I must say we were full of anticipation, especially after our past few trips.  Our plan once again was to go for the tripple header (pike whitefish and lakers), this time giving ourselves more time for lakers and whities.  The surface temps were quite a bit warmer compared to our last trip, so we decided to fish the deeper edges and weedbeds, which paid off almost immediately.  The bite was a bit slow and lite, the pike were not slamming our bait as they did previously.  In fact, of 4 pike the hook came out 3 times as the fish were netted.  Happy with our results, we decided to stick with the plan, and at 0900 decided to target whities and lakers (but not before going back to the launch...the coffee was really working on me).    Much to my surprise there were quite a few boats out there.  After about an hour of jigging and nothing to show for, I suggested we put the riggers to use and troll for lakers.  We couldn't have been trolling for more than 10 minutes, and we had our first laker in the box.  We trolled around, and then jigged again, but no more luck.  By 1300 it got really hot (thank goodness for the bimini top), and the gnats were getting quite pesky too, so we decided to call it an awesome day, and headed back home.  Gotta love it when you unexpectedly have an opportunity to get out on such a beautiful day, and even bring some fish home.  "
