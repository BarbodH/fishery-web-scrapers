84035,ccmtcanada,2007-06-15 03:28:00,7971,"I decided to head to a different spot tonight....my usual fishing hole has been hit and miss lately.  Basskicker and I have been in touch all week about hooking up, so he joined me just after 8:00pm.  It was a little crowded there tonight...cant blame everyone...it was perfect weather to be out fishing!  Anyhow, the spot I wanted to fish was occupied all night, so we had to cast our lines to a spot that has never produced a fish for me.  We had a great chat about his fishing trip up north a while ago... had a few line bumps, but finally, at 10pm, Basskicker packed his stuff and went home.  I decided to wait and see if some of the others would leave as well!!  Finally, at 10:30, the majority of people left and I inched my chair closer to where I wanted to be.  I was able to cast to the area I wanted, and wouldn't you know it, 10 minutes later, I hooked into this one!  It was tricky to get in because the fish swam straight for shore.  As I was reeling madly, the fish unfortunately crossed one of the other guys lines and we both ended up having to bring it in.  He thought he had hooked it, so the moment of truth came and lo and behold my hair rig was firmly embedded in it's mouth.  He was a great guy...he wanted to learn about hair rigs and feeders, so we had a great chat as I was packing up.  I told him where to find the feeders and I gave him a hair rig and off I went.  I didn't bother to measure this guy, but I estimate he was a 15 or 16 pounder.  It looks bigger in the pic because he came up close and I did that great ""arm extend""....LOL.   Who knows how many I could have hooked into if I had the spot I wanted...oh well...what can ya do right?  I was just happy I got one!!!"
84040,Victor,2007-06-15 03:33:00,1609,"Great report as usual. it is something i look forward to every night at around 11 30 indeed haha. So please keep them coming Cliff, i might not be able to sleep one night if i don't see one  nice fish btw! the head looks so much bigger than its tail section"
84041,Badger Shark,2007-06-15 03:34:00,291,"Man Cliff I wish I could get out as much as you do and have the success you have.  Great report as always, looking forward to the next one.  Come on now and break the 30lb mark."
84043,MJL,2007-06-15 03:35:00,2427,"Sweet report...Nice fish too  I'll probably be spot-hopping around your neck of the woods tomorrow trying a few places.  Gotta test out a few new toys...If you see someone studying for an Economics final exam while fishing, say hi."
84044,Mike the Pike,2007-06-15 03:36:00,3421,This is why I can't go to bed early at night anymore I am waiting for the last report of the day and that my friend is fresh fish report.  WTG Cliff   MTP

84048,MJL,2007-06-15 03:42:00,2427, You're actually not the first person I've heard of doing that.  I know of someone else who religiously sits at his (or her) computer and presses the refresh button every 2 min awaiting for Cliff's carp reports to come through...Cough cough Victor...Cough cough.
84052,Mike the Pike,2007-06-15 03:55:00,3421,  LOL MJL so true   MTP

84129,ccmtcanada,2007-06-15 12:26:00,7971, LOL...it took Victor a whole 5 minutes to post on this one though...I was very disappointed in him....haha
84178,RobHall,2007-06-15 15:41:00,261,Congrats Cliff!     Yet another nice sized Carp.  Thanks for sharing.  Keep those Carp reports coming.  I always look forward to the Carp King and Queen's evening reports.  Cheers.  FOTB 
84195,Bernie,2007-06-15 16:35:00,3190,"Hey Cliff, hope we can find some pike that size next weekend (or bigger). Nice catch! Looks like some fun to reel in."
84202,ccmtcanada,2007-06-15 16:53:00,7971, Bernie...now that the water's have warmed they are a LOT of fun to land.  It helps to have 30 pound Power Pro mainline and 20 pound leaders too!! LOL.  Yep...hoping the pike are as big next weekend!  Really looking forward to it...
