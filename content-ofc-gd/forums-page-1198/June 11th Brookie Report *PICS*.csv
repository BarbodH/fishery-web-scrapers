They are a relatively short life-span fish with a taste many would argue cant be compared ... so dont feel bad about some success .... and certainly take great pleasure in the opportunity to eat a few !  The truth is they are hard to come by for most and as such their whereabouts are normally a jealously guarded secret but if you are lucky to have a few near to you ... feel lucky .. you are !  C&R on specks is a little bit overatted in my opinion as they are not that hardy of a fish ... although I did catch one a couple weeks back with a snelled hook (taken deeply) still hanging out of its mouth ...   Any how, if I had creeks with 12+ inchers nearby I'd be there too !   Enjoy !  My 2 cents"

The ones we have to look out for are the guys who have zip-lock bags full in the freezer and you don't sound like that type. So good fishing and enjoy"
