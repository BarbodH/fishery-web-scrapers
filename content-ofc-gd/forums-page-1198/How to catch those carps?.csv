Is it possible to catch those carps?  Some sort of fly top water ?   Heck even all the catfish I seen was swimming around topwater.    -- Off the topic a little but...  Whatever you do, avoid flying out from or connecting from Philadelphia airport. It is just nightmare there...  that airport is the place to be if you want major delay for no reason."

So what i decided to do was put some corn on a hook and get a float and just cast it between them. Very first cast,  i have a fish on and i lose it. I am a  fairly superstitious guy and whenever i get a fish on on the first cast and i lose it, i never seem to catch anything else. But anyways i kept on casting, couple of times they hit a float but they wouldnt touch my bait. Maybe you`ll have better luck."

I'll usually try for them for a while, and then give up and cast further away in deeper water....I find the ones cruising the deeper waters are more likely to be feeding.  Carp experts out there...am I off base here?  I hope so, cause I'd like to get the ones that I can see RIGHT in front of me like that!!! LOL."
84169,wolfville,2007-06-15 15:12:00,396,"There is a theory: if they see you, you won't catch them. Always applies to me (applies even when they don't see me   )  If they are close to the surface, they are probably not in the mood of feeding. You can try a few things to trigger them to hit. A lot people have had great success free lining bread. (squeeze the bread into a small ball, hide the hook in it, cast it out without any weight or float). Normally you want to try to cast this thing to where they will pass, not where they already are.  Or you can throw some sweet corns where they are but don't throw your line in there. Observe their reaction. If they don't feed, there's no point trying. Sometimes the food trigger them into feeding mood. When that happens, almost everything catches.  Disclaimer: me no expert, just like to share the little thing I know and get your feedback."
