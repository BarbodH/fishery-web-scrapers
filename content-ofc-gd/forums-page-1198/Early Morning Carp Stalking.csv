83866,dsn,2007-06-14 19:18:00,1018,After a few weeks of craziness I had to go back and refresh my fish towel with carp scent. Got to the location around 8am. Since I live closer now to the fish. When I got there I saw lots of bubbles everywhere. The fish were searching for food in groups. And they were right up against the edge of the pond. This one I caught took a rig I just dropped about 2 inches from my feet. But with that it also spooked the rest of the fish.           I caught 3 -4 in total. I had to do some other stuff rest of the day. So I didn't stay for long maybe 3-4 hrs and left. Snapped this shot below. I thought they were swimming in a neat pattern before they scattered and mess up the shot.    For some reason they look nicer in formation.     dsn

83898,dsn,2007-06-14 20:47:00,1018,  It's impossible to get skunked now at this time 007. They are feeding like mad. You might have to do walk about like unbanangler and I did.  It works everytime. Hes the pro now.  dsn
83900,dsn,2007-06-14 20:49:00,1018, We gotta meet up and beat them again. LOL Or if the island isn't too pollenated I might be able to head out there.  dsn
