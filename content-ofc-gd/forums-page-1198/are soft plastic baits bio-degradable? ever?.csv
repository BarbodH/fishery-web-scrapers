83516,mudball,2007-06-14 02:27:00,5,I was asked by my wife and I don't know the answer. I do know that various plastic worms and grubs and such can become a gooey mess in the tackle box. Can we plan to hand down the Gulp! baits to the grandchildren in twenty years?  :rolleyes:
83522,Greencoachdog,2007-06-14 02:41:00,8163,"Plastic is NOT!!! However, the Berkley Gulp and Food Source line of soft baits is bio-degradeble.  Gulp is the most famous, plastic baits are injurious to the wildlife that eat them, they cannot digest them and the lodge in the digestive tract and cause illness.  http://www.fslures.com/product-info/problem-with-plastic.php"

83627,mart,2007-06-14 12:41:00,93,The downfall to Gulp is they dry up quick.  You can't  re-use like other soft plastics. Once you rig one up if you let it sit out of water they start to shrink and dry up. The plus side is they are bio-degradable in water which is better for the environment.
