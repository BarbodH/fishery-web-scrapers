83699,RobHall,2007-06-14 14:44:00,261,"Since the summer of 2005, I have been reading the threads/posts about the much anticipated Lakair g2g's that have occured every year for the past several years.  As the old saying goes...a picture is worth a 1000 words.  It's too bad you can't do a search now and come up with lakair threads of previous years.  I'd sure like to see some older group pics, etc of the g2g, from the very first time and as the years have gone by.  Does anyone who has been going since the very beginning, have pics they could share?  Or can any point me to where i could find these threads/pics?  I know the group has gotten bigger over the years, as new members join in the fun.  I wonder who has been going from the very beginning.  I also wonder about the story behind the following pic of TJ holding a monster ski.  Is this a Lakair record?  When was the pic taken?  Who was there that year?...etc.    Cheers  FOTB "
83700,Roy,2007-06-14 14:47:00,13728,That fish wasn't taken at a get together
83702,Joey,2007-06-14 14:49:00,9122,"Tybo and I didn't go to the first one, but went to the second annual and every one since.  I'll dig up some old pics and post some if I can find them.  Joey"
83705,TJQ,2007-06-14 14:57:00,7806,Hmm... I caught that fish with Cory.. in August of 2003 I think..  hand lined it in on a broken reel and 8 foot downrigger rod...  Im sure there were only a dozen of us the first time around...
83708,Roy,2007-06-14 15:09:00,13728,"There were 17 of us, Boss."
83709,Roy,2007-06-14 15:10:00,13728,23 if you count the dogs.
83712,TJQ,2007-06-14 15:14:00,7806,LOL.. well... i wasnt in much shape for counting.....
83715,lew,2007-06-14 15:22:00,12767,"I missed the 1st one, but have been to all the rest, and it is definetely  the OFC social event of the year. Matter of fact, I'm packin my gear as we speak   TJ caught a musky ???? ..... don't think I've heard that story........OH wait a minute, I think it's all starting to come back to me now......."
83722,Roy,2007-06-14 15:33:00,13728, That's only cause you were moving around too much. I could count more easily as I was sorta tied down to my job.
83731,Joey,2007-06-14 15:44:00,9122, How many pound test was that again Roy?
83770,RobHall,2007-06-14 16:56:00,261, The lakair g2g sure has grown over the years.  What started with 17 and has now grown to a group of 44 and counting.  Should be a real blast.  I look forward to all the lakair reports in 2 weeks.  FOTB 
83909,Rich Clemens,2007-06-14 21:07:00,3131,Me too ... I just hope I have something to report.
83912,Roy,2007-06-14 21:18:00,13728," Rich, didn't you get the memo? What happens at Lakair STAYS at Lakair!"
83931,tjsa,2007-06-14 22:39:00,1578,"Roy, where is the picture of the very first GTG? You sent me the pic, and  I HAD it on my pc, but I think I deleted it. At least, I cannot find it now."
83965,Rich Clemens,2007-06-15 00:00:00,3131, I saw something to that effect ... .thought they were kidding.   What do I know
84008,douG,2007-06-15 02:02:00,2693,Someone has the photo post from the Lakair Crayola Invitational tourneys #s 1 et deux.  Pretty darn sure that this would be a great place to stick it / them.  Seeing a snoozing Mod trussed like a turkey is a very special thing.   I personally won't be the same after that.
84020,thecraftyprince,2007-06-15 02:39:00,37,I'd like to request the video of Maureen's bellybutton please.
84021,Joey,2007-06-15 02:40:00,9122,"Okay, as promised, I dug up some old photos.  They're poor quality from a *gasp* disposable camera and scanned, but I had them on disc.  This is from the second annual in or around the unsociable tent.  Enjoy...                    Cheers,  Joey"
84022,Dondorfish,2007-06-15 02:45:00,1000,  HA HA HA HA - Thats funny Joey!!!  Looks like quite the time - gotta quit my job so I can make time to go  - well - maybe next year!  Thanks for posting the pictures   Don
