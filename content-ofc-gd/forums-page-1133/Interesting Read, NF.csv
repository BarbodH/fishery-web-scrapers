The solution side has far less documentation in our media so I thought I would share a story I read this morning in my lovely Edmonton Hotel room.  Globe and Mail Article  I thought this to be a fun way to start the day on a positive note.  Mayhaps we could build a local fishing pond in a grocery store parking lot where ""snaggers and poachers"" could have a great time.  hahaha"
