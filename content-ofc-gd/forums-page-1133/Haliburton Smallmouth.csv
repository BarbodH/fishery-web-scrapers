123570,Aaron Shirley,2007-10-15 17:43:00,655,"I had the pleasure of fishing with Jimmy Dodd in the Haliburton Lakes on the weekend. Chris, Bob and Jeff were also up there with us, and it was a blast. Thank you to Chris Giles and Jim Dodd for the invite at the last minute, I look forward to next year already.  Good smallmouth fishing during the day, great company, cards and beer at night     What else is better than that?  How did you guys make out on Sunday???  I will mention though, that I showed up north dressed very lightly and wearing sandals.  Holy crap was it cold up there at around 3 Degrees C.! It's a good thing I brought up insulated Kodiak boots and my Lund Gore Tex rainsuit! We live in the banana belt here in Southwestern Ontario!  I had a great time on the Haliburtons, and I would like to personally thank you for having me out on your boat Jimmy. It was nice to get out on someone elses boat for a change. It was a Husky Jerk, X-Rap, carolina rig, drop shot and tube jig bite up there. We got them anywhere from 6-feet to 25-feet deep along rocky and weedy shoreline. Here are some shots from the Haliburtons...  Jeff with a nice fish   Jim (left) caught this smallie on a jerk bait, and Jeff (right) jumps into the pic   Jimmy with a great northern bronzeback   Jim with a slightly bigger than typical sized bass for the Haliburton area in the fall   Jimmy Dodd pretty much put on a clinic for me on his favourite fall watersheds. Jim had a hot hand with several fish over 3, a few close to 4 and one close to 5-pounds. We all caught many fish from 3-pounds and under to keep us all busy.  Here are a bunch of nice pics from day two with Jim and his bass. Just awesome colouration on these true northern bronzebacks                Thanks again boys!  Aaron"

123598,solopaddler,2007-10-15 18:16:00,8605," Havn't you heard, there's a handy little thing called weather forecasts, usually pretty accurate a day or two in advance.  Wicked report, and gorgeous fish Aaron!"

123631,Aaron Shirley,2007-10-15 19:14:00,655," LOL, yeah I was a dumbass not to check the forecast that far north.  I wasn't thinking.. but you can bet your biggest smallmouth I will be more prepared next trip!  Blaque, thanks, I do like to get creative with photos.  The fall colours in the background make for some really nice shots  Good fishing!  Aaron"
123634,misfish,2007-10-15 19:20:00,29133,Love the colors on them. I see your throwing wieghtless. Love that that way of throwing plastics.  Great report.
123677,Jigger,2007-10-15 21:22:00,1237,"Nice shots Aaron! Sounds like you guys covered some water looking for those smallies. Were you guys on one lake the whole weekend? Thanks for the report. BTW, what was the water temp?"
123718,Aaron Shirley,2007-10-15 22:44:00,655,"Thanks for the comments guys.  If I remember correctly, the surface water temp was between 56 F. and 58 F.  We spent time on different lakes on the weekend.  Cheers,  Aaron"
123806,Dano,2007-10-16 01:29:00,719,Nice fish man! I just love those big fat fall smallies.
123813,fishboy,2007-10-16 01:47:00,550,"Great fish & pics; making me wish I was up on my ""home water"".  I hope they raise the water levels a bit-we're entering prime lake trout spawning time."
123829,007,2007-10-16 02:13:00,537,"Wow, those smallmouth have amazing markings!  Is it a new sub-species - a leopard bass!"
