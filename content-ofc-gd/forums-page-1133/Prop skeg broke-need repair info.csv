123610,bassfighter,2007-10-15 18:33:00,366,"The skeg on my Motor Guide 36lb trust trolling motor just broke.  Do we need to take the internal motor out before getting it fix due to potential overheating of the external housing during re-welding of a replacement skeg?  My prop skeg broke yesterday when my boat was coming in a little bit too fast and hit the boat ramp on our way in, and the trolling motor skeg ends up hitting the side of the deck first.  Any prop repair recommendation.  Thanks for advice."

It is called COMMUTER.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...skegcloseup.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...centeroring.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../insidewire.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...skegcloseup.jpg  I am not sure if I can just use a fiberglass and glue a piece of hard plasic to it. Will it stay put?  There is a black rubber or soft plastic in the middle and I hope it will not melt after getting the amount of heat from welding."
123856,Guest skeeter99,2007-10-16 04:04:00,0,"I would just leave as is  I had one break off my old motorguide, ran it for 3 years no issues  that skeg is really only there to protect the prop, you can never get your boat moving fast enough for that skeg(that is missing) to become a steering issue"
123859,irishfield,2007-10-16 04:09:00,26272,"I was just gonna say that skeeter...it sure didn't save anything but maybe a plastic prop... with it breaking off. Can buy a handful of props for what repairs would cost. Just hope those wires and insulation aren't screwed..looks a tad out of shape now and it's a ""commutator"""
123862,Guest skeeter99,2007-10-16 04:34:00,0,"one thing though bassfighter  when you go to but that thing back together, make sure the brushes are aligned  I found this out when i got mt friend to shorten my shaft by about 9 inches   it goes together real easy except the last 1/4 of inch when the magnet slams the 2 part housing together and brushes get put ion their sides  my motoguide started acting funny after that would work fine then stop then work, until I heard it humming funny in the water, took it apart and the brushes were on their sides, quick replace and solder job and off to the races again  never did like motoguide**unless u can find a 4 blade machete prop** they outperformed minnkota's by far  but the new motorguides IMO are crap get hung up in slop way to easy, were a minnkota just chugs away"
123884,misfish,2007-10-16 10:02:00,29133,To bad I wasnt closer. I got a big roll of duct tape that could hold that baby together.LOL  OUCH
123891,Terry,2007-10-16 10:54:00,14456,I would find a piece of pipe the same size as the housing cut just under half  the pipe off weld or solder   a home made skeg  to it and hold it on with 2 or 3 pipe clamps  as it has been stated it is just to protect the prop
