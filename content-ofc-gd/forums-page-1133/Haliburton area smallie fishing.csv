Im finally going to have some time to get out on the water next week...its my reading week   I had quite a few places in mind to chase some smallies and eyes but am really interested in the haliburton area because I would also like to do some grouse hunting..  anyone fish this area this time of year for smallies on here? Also which lakes hold good numbers of smallmouth? Am looking at kashaga lodge in lake kashawigamog but not sure how the smallie fishing is in that lake. Any advice on a lake to choose  would be apprciated....also any other areas or lakes you could suggest would be great....feel free to pm me ...thanks guys
