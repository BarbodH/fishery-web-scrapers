124071,cranks bait,2007-10-16 19:38:00,721,I was given a spool of Vicious to try this summer.  It was the new Ultimate not the floro.  I personally did not like it.  It had no feel to the line at all.  I caught several fish and didn't even know until they were at the boat.  I know someone else who tried it and had the same results.  He though it was just him.
