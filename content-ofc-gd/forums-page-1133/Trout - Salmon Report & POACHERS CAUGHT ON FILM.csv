123974,Bly,2007-10-16 14:01:00,1556,Well done and Thank you!
124002,Fishnfiend,2007-10-16 15:14:00,357," If they were starving, it's not like they could sell their car for much $ to buy food..."
123070,mikeymikey,2007-10-13 20:23:00,376,Dont' know anyone who goes for a walk with a pitch pork.  How does driving a specific car matters here ?  Charge the rich? Let the poor go?  Please keep us updated with the result.
123076,chickenhawk,2007-10-13 21:12:00,612,yeah if you look close on one of the other pics there is some blood on the garbage bag so yes i do think there is enough evidence there to have a case on these 2.  bout time these ppl get caught.
123077,Photoz,2007-10-13 21:29:00,792,"After I read your post I decided to go for a drive and try out my new(est) camera at the Old Mill dam. There was about a half dozen fishing the sanctuary, casting right to the base of the dam, but after spending an hour or more from a good vantage point, I never saw ONE fish caught, or even missed. Nice to have a 36mm - 432mm lense . . . .    ya can count nose hairs from a good safe distance! Although I got good clear looks through my lens at about 5 of 'em (all young & W.A.S.P.y looking), I didn't get any opportunity for a good action shot. Woulda been REAL nice to get more of what you witnessed, some clown actually spearing the fish . . . .     date & time stamped on the shots to boot!! The bonus here . . . .     IF a charge is laid (the Crown has last say on whether to proceed) all I need is a subpoena in hand, I get full pay, for however long the case might take. This is the way to go though if you're serious . . .    a good long lens, very recognizable photo of the offense taking place & your camera card . . . .    so there can be no claim of 'Photoshopping' the pic. Good hunting bro . . .    keep us informed on what happens!"
123090,Fisherman,2007-10-13 22:11:00,7201,"Here's part of the issue, what were they doing with something that can be construed as a spear... â€¢ Possess a spear for the purpose of fishing on or within 30 m (98.2 ft.) of the edge of any waters except when fishing in accordance with the regulations (refer to Non-angling Methods, page 7)"
123092,danc,2007-10-13 22:17:00,4677,Nice work ranger520vx. Don't let the naysayers discourage you. We need it to be known that we are watching at all times. And we have cameras and a huge support group. Let's nail these guys.
123095,Moosebunk,2007-10-13 22:22:00,3970,So many would have just watched it go down then ranted about it later.  Good to see you tried and hope it does put the numbnut terds in some trouble.
123155,mattyk,2007-10-14 03:12:00,2110,good work!
123161,DMASSE,2007-10-14 03:35:00,420,"Good Work,  but with no pictures of them actually fishing in the water, I would have to say that it would be hard to prove anything..  I would think all he would have to say is that he was gathering dead fish for his garden,  But no to discourege you, keep it up.  I know I have taken live videos and sent them to the MNR with no results...  I think its better to let them know that we are watching  Dave"
123165,Joey,2007-10-14 03:51:00,9122,"I'd certainly like to see the outcome of this.  Keep us informed please!!  And good job, I think if they even get a warning, it might stop them from doing it again, maybe......   Joey"
123178,wolfville,2007-10-14 05:03:00,396,"It takes me and others next to no effort to reply and express whatever view point one may have,  but it takes a real hero to actually do things like what you have done. I thank you for doing the right thing."
123179,redfin,2007-10-14 05:05:00,79,"Holy crap...how desperate do you have to be???  I read about this on two different Chinese fishing sites and most of the members are furious regarding these poachers  :angry:    .  A picture is worth a thousand words, I hope these guys get what they deserve."
123184,solopaddler,2007-10-14 10:52:00,8605," That was funny Terry thanks for the laugh  .  Well done ranger, regardless of the outcome at least you tried, something most people wouldn't do."
123191,Zamboni,2007-10-14 12:39:00,235,"Great work with the pics, mnr can certainly make a case against these characters. When first confronted/contacted they will probably further implicate themselves-especially if shown the pictures."
123193,Muskieman,2007-10-14 12:54:00,2472,"I can't beleive he's actually smiling in that picture  !!  And if his wife were to have fallen forward she'd a speared herself in tha face...  Good For You !!!   PARTICIPACTION!!!  If we all do our little part , something might actually be done by the MNR..  REPORT A POACHER"
123197,Clampet,2007-10-14 13:17:00,1947," Go to the freeking store and buy a box of .99 Kraft Dinner, sheesh!"
123768,ehg,2007-10-16 00:03:00,2666,Wonder how this turned out? Eating that skanky nearly dead salmon is probably enough punishment.
123827,007,2007-10-16 02:07:00,537,"Good job Ranger.  It's about time more people did more than look the other way when it comes to illegal fishing.  You did the right thing in my book.  I hope its enough to get a prosecution.  I don't understand why the MNR are not down at these very obvious places checking licences and infringements in restricted areas.  We all know its happening, so where is the CO to show people that they can't do it????  Nowhere to be seen and therefore they do it and will continue to do it - rape the fisheries of whatever species is easy pickings at that time of year!  It's a disgrace."
123875,wuchikubo,2007-10-16 08:00:00,1114,"Good job Ranger, I commend your efforts as a law abiding angler. It is truly revolting to see that there are people doing this and having a smile on their face as they leave. I hope the get the heavy handed reward from the MNR. I hope this makes the newspapers (especially the Chinese ones). Truly sad and disgraceful."
123882,misfish,2007-10-16 09:59:00,29133,"  What ever,  chut up u.   Well the way it was done is not right and do they have lic,(fishing) Although I havent aggreed with alot of the PF comments latley,if they were hungry well,I say ok,but make sure they DO get fined and then edumacated. Buddy sure does have a big smile on his face.  I applaude your effort Mark.   BTW, what color stage are the browns at ? I like it when the males get that big kyp on them."
123886,Terry,2007-10-16 10:19:00,14456,took long enough  it was a joke.....LOL if they were driving a dodge I would have said dodge instead
123889,misfish,2007-10-16 10:33:00,29133,"Come on a dodge,they wouldnt even make it out of the drive way. HAHAHAHAHAA"
123900,pigeonfisher,2007-10-16 11:22:00,696,"  Just playing devils advocate, Brian.  For fear that everyone would judge me for seeing me in a photo without knowing the circumstances behind them.  I do not agree with what those folks are doing, at all...  Also my F150 is just fine, Terry."
123916,bigcreekdad,2007-10-16 12:19:00,546,Good for you.
123941,Parisite,2007-10-16 13:18:00,66, Hahahaha!  The Whitebucket Scandal!
123962,Terry,2007-10-16 13:45:00,14456,"without knowing all the facts it could be a problem but he saw what he saw and he reported what he saw with photos , but  who knows it may turn out that these people are Inuit and have their band number and was harvesting fish according to their treaty with the Canadian peoples...  it is up to the police and courts to decide what is lawful or not  but one thing we know for sure  ....they were driving a ford....enough said....LOL"
123024,ranger520vx,2007-10-13 16:43:00,164,Well it was a nice morning to take a few drifts close to home at the Humber River. landed 2 nice Brown Trout both about 6 pounds and released along with 4 Chinook.  My day soon went for dump when I witnessed two folks SPEARING Salmon just upstream of me with a pitchfork type lawn instrument.  The guy kept 2 fish inside of 5 minutes and left.  It was also the day the movie function on my camera didn't seem to work. I and an independent other party watched it all go down in front of us from above hidden in some trees.  I have still photos of the 2 culprits here and have notified all authorities. It will be my 3rd time being involved with these types of crimes as a witness.  Evidence  I wish one day the respect for all wildlife can be better entrenched in our laws and better education be available.
123027,mikeymikey,2007-10-13 16:59:00,376,"Oh wow...  wish I could have seen the actual action on video too.  Hope they can charged heavily!  Wish there was a shot of them with a salmon visible and not covered by that white bucket plastic bag.  Maybe some picture of pitch pork striking the water.  Oh yes,,, that sure isn't a fishing rod.  You can clear see some pork alike spear in one end."
123028,Rizzo,2007-10-13 17:03:00,4754,hopefully this will lead to some charges and a conviction!
123029,KyleM,2007-10-13 17:05:00,218,Good on you.  Did these dolts not say anything to you when they realized you were snapping pictures of them.  What a pair of goofs.  I dont care if they knew they were breaking the law or not. Its everyones duty to KNOW the law when heading out onto the rivers and streams.
123031,Fishmaster,2007-10-13 17:09:00,920,I think you will need better pics then that to have them charged ..for one you can't tell whats in there bag ..or if thats a spear or just a walking stick ..
123034,KyleM,2007-10-13 17:12:00,218,In one of the pictures you can make out that it has spears on the end of it.  They should atleast be contacted and questioned.
123035,Photoz,2007-10-13 17:13:00,792,"Although I applaud your effort, what you have is photos of a garbage bag & an impliment a thoughtful citizen could be using to pick up garbage along the park trails. A Ministry rep wouldn't even present this as evidence to the Crown to lay a charge, as you could never get a conviction on what you have. If by some miracle, a C. O. was interested, as was a Crown Attorney, NOW it would be your word against the 2 culprits who's only interest was to clean garbage from the park. (Have you any proof there was illegally caught fish in those bags?) Recognizable shots of the guy actually USING the fork to spear the fish, and taking the impaled fish off it would have had a slight chance, but law enforcement people are very leary of doing all this paperwork, only to find their witness is not prepared to donate a few day's work to sitting in a courtroom And last, but not least, can you AFFORD a day or more off work, to attend court as a witness? You get about $10.00 witness fees, outta that comes your parking, gas & lunch? Been there . . . .     done that! Like I say, you are applauded for dutifully being a good citizen, taking the time to do something, too bad it's been wasted!"
123037,ranger520vx,2007-10-13 17:18:00,164,"I wish the video was working on camera as I said because all speculation would be set aside. And, there is another concerned citizen who was not an angler provided contact info and will serve as witness.  I hope this doesn't become the white bucket thing because its not my intent."
123038,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-13 17:23:00,0,"Nice pics of the ""PERPS""  ...but how about a pic of the fish you caught???? You did have your camera with you and it works quite well........  "
123042,ranger520vx,2007-10-13 17:30:00,164,Went solo GB so no pics and I don't shoot them laying in the mud either.   Just got off the phone with CO and they are following up.
123043,KyleM,2007-10-13 17:31:00,218,"Photoz, I dont believe the COs need to make a case to the crown to initially lay the charge. It happens quite a bit in enforcement, people who are outright guilty with next to no proof will still be charged and its used as a slap on the wrist.  Dont forget, if these people have to show up in court they also lose a days pay.  If you are charged and still found not-guilty, the initial charge stays on your record."
123046,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-13 17:36:00,0,in the mud? You use a net? You took your camera to shoot poacher shots??  ah well ...........rather would have seen fish in the mud instead of what you see everyday on any river in southern Ontario this time of year....
123048,luv2drift,2007-10-13 17:47:00,147,hmmmmm I wonder why people are being pushed into the lakes.........might be vigiante justice I understand why now.
123050,Terry,2007-10-13 18:14:00,14456,"I can see the pitch fork and the tail of the fish in the bag, no rod on them and walking up from the water.....sounds like a fair case to me     thanks for taking the time hope they burn in hell"
123051,pigeonfisher,2007-10-13 18:19:00,696,"Illegal, yes.  I wonder if they were hungry and needed the fish for food?  Burning in hell is a strong wish, they might just be hungry."
123052,Terry,2007-10-13 18:32:00,14456,"well , they were driving a ford..so I guess they could be down on their luck"
123053,Sandbag,2007-10-13 18:32:00,533,"Although some people don't believe there is sufficient evidence there for charges to be laid, I would disagree.  The photos you have obtained certainly will assist in identifying the pair which is usually the most difficult part of a prosecution.  The photos's, coupled with a detailed statement from yourself as to what you observed them doing is no doubt sufficient evidence for charges to be laid.  I applaud your efforts as I'm sure every other ""Sportman/Sportswoman"" on this board will  Well done  Craig"
123054,jediangler,2007-10-13 18:44:00,1923,"Ha, ha, good one Terry. Driving a Ford and eating those Salmon should be punishment enough.  I applaud your efforts ranger, keep up the good fight."
123055,Golfisher,2007-10-13 18:49:00,586,I sure hope they get what they deserve.
123056,keram,2007-10-13 18:59:00,585," I'm with JA on this 100%. You did your part  If I see something like this, I will do exactly same thing, regardles of the opinion of armchair ""experts""   (lawyers, attorneys, COs and others)"
123057,fatherof3,2007-10-13 19:11:00,1769,good for you for not just sitting back but doing something productive/positive about it.
123063,fishindevil,2007-10-13 19:40:00,6254,"Well i comend you for doing that !!!!!   i hope when you forward all that evidence that its enough for the MNR to lay charges.  ..but lets see what they do about it...i was once told they have to be caught in the act,and that 3 witnesses wasnt enough   to lay a charge...you know the way the law works????"
123065,Fisherman,2007-10-13 19:54:00,7201,"Pictures worth a thousand words,  can't wait to see the outcome of this one."
123066,steverowbotham,2007-10-13 19:58:00,1800,"i wonder why they get pushed into the lake, i have many asian friends that abide by the laws, but way too often do i see this."
123068,brifishrgy,2007-10-13 20:15:00,559,"Problem I see is once they get home they could say there 3rd friend was carrying the rods or they were given the fish by an anglers and they were just there for a walk .. when I used to fish Bronte (10 or so years ago) people would ask to keep your fish without even fishing (always threw em back ) .. without ""caught in the act"" pictures or video they will prob get off .. your word against theirs . you done good though .. keep it up .. and get that camera fixed while your at it"
