Would anyone be willing to give up any inside tips on location, structure to look for or specific techniques.  I wouldn't mind taking my kids out for one last shot at a big one for the year.  Never fished simcoe before so if somenone could somewhat point me in the right direction that would be great.  Bill"

123908,Blake,2007-10-16 11:36:00,418,Bill ant of the rock shorelines and deeper rock piles mid lake and islands on the map should hold some quality fish this time of year.  Going out of Beaverton area is probaly best or out of Orillia then if its too windy you can always fish Couch.
123928,B Diddy,2007-10-16 12:47:00,33,Thanks Blake!!  Hopefully we'll hook into some good ones.  My 2 boys are young (7 & 9) & have really taken an interest this year......a great thing for a dad that likes to fish!!
124013,misfish,2007-10-16 15:46:00,29133,  Words to take notice of. It is true.

124076,misfish,2007-10-16 19:41:00,29133,"Thats a nice first photo. Can I use it some time? The boat I mean,say next Saturday."
124102,B Diddy,2007-10-16 21:15:00,33,Thanks for the advise guys.....good point about the water conditions.  My ol' ship plenty sea worthy but I'd rather be safe than sorry for sure with the kiddies!!
