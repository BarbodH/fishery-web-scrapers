123680,Rich,2007-10-15 21:30:00,3927,Who needs steelhead!        I think I'll be targetting carp for most of the fall with that float rod. What an awesome fight!

123716,FinS,2007-10-15 22:40:00,463,how do u like your okuma i bought one 2 weeks ago been playing around with it since then i like it so far but im thinking of upgrading the bearings looked like fun congrats
123719,Rich,2007-10-15 22:44:00,3927,"I'm lovin' it FinS.. This will be it's 2nd season and I think it works just great. Since I don't float fish that often (maybe more often now!) I don't see a point in upgrading. I also like my new Browning Six Rivers rod.. much better than the old Quantum Cold Water I had last year. A little shorter though but that comes in handy on the smaller creeks.  Thanks for the comments guys hopefully sometime this week I will do a more in-depth report on how to float fish for carp. It's really similar to steelheading in shallow creeks. Sight fishing them with worms or doughballs.. I bet a roe bag would even work, lol"
