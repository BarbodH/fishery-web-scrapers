41149,irishfield,2007-02-28 17:00:00,26272,Connie...all that matters right now is that you have that roll of bills in your pocket for a spring trip to Geary's. Nothing else!
41174,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-28 17:44:00,957,Right Wayne.  My fishing money is so well hidden that it sometimes takes days for me to find it.
43714,SlowPoke,2007-03-06 10:32:00,2984," ""Next Monday"" Market.... Change....... Value S&P/TSX -152.02...... 12,711.25 DJIA -63.69 ..............12,050.41 S&P 500 -13.05 .........1,374.12 Nasdaq -27.32 ...........2,340.68  You're a trailblazer Rick!"
43717,Big Cliff,2007-03-06 11:09:00,6899,"I do all my buying on line through Royal Bank but if I buy in today before 3:00 pm, I get the price based on the CLOSE of todays market.  Rick's advice was right on the money.   Yesterday was an excellent day to buy in as overnignt asian markets recovered significantly which means that NA markets will likely follow suit today.  I'm not sure that we have seen the bottom of the barrel yet but even if the market just recovers you stand to make some nice returns on investment.  Remember, buy when it is going down, sell when it is going up (so many people do it the other way around!)"
124028,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-16 16:54:00,957,"Bought two Roth IRA effective March 1, 2007 @ $5000 each  TG  $5000 in Vanguard Emerging Markets Fund worth $7362.17 on October 15, 2007  Ms TG  $5000 in Vanguard Global Equity Fund worth $5910.06 on October 15, 2007  If I live long enough and the market stays strong I might someday amount to something.  Or maybe not.  I'm having fun."
124041,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-16 17:27:00,0,Its a good day to sell!!!.....  Hold and prosper???......  Ah well....WHO REALLY KNOWS....RAMA's a good bet!!! lol
124053,tbayboy,2007-10-16 18:31:00,1497,"You buggers revived this thread just to give me a heart attack didn't you?  I've been in meetings all day and haven't looked at the market - my first stop was here and I see this 400 point correction thread -   .  Now I've gotta go fishing to get my blood pressure back down, thanks guys"
40766,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 20:06:00,2984,I'm sitting here watching my investments disappear... DOW down 500 TSX down 440  Ouch.  Need to stop looking.  Can't stop.  Ouch.
40772,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 20:18:00,2585,china's stock exchange was down 9%.  You had to know today was not going to be a picnic in north america too.  Its a pretty big correction.  The big question is will the rest of the week follow suit or like I tend to believe will the market gain wed-fri?  Hope your not losing to much today!  Cheers!
40784,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 20:35:00,2585,ps.   tsx -363 so its gaining some ground hopefully it keeps up!
40795,SlowPoke,2007-02-27 20:50:00,2984,Yep... I read about the China correction and thought it was a drastic NAmerican reaction and figured there would be an afternoon rebound but around 2:50PM markets took a further swan dive... 100 points on both markets in about 10 minutes. I have seen nothing to substantiate it. The rebound since then will only get us back to 2:00PM levels at best where otherwise we might settled back to 150+- losses on both markets. I really shouldn't be watching it... I don't plan on selling anyway. Ouch.
40810,bigbuck,2007-02-27 21:20:00,2449,"Look at it this way, it's a good day to buy..........."
40811,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 21:20:00,2585,if your in the market it hard not to watch lol  Cheers!
40818,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-27 21:33:00,957,What we have is a buying opportunity.  Selling at a 3 or 4% discount.  Count me in.
40819,bigfish1965,2007-02-27 21:35:00,3382,This correction was predicted quite a few weeks ago. Lots of bargains available now.
40825,sturgman,2007-02-27 21:55:00,249,And here I was thinking this was a thread about Captain Canada Ryan Smyth getting traded away from the Oilers today on the trade deadline.
40830,irishfield,2007-02-27 22:08:00,26272,You're only losing if you pull it out.....let it ride.....or like Connie...Buy some more ! LOL
40837,moemoe,2007-02-27 22:19:00,352,I thought this thread was about the OIlers too.......
40841,fishforfun,2007-02-27 22:26:00,105,I thought there was a beer strike! Thak god
40844,Rich Clemens,2007-02-27 22:33:00,3131,"The way the market was climbing over the past few months, a correction was inevitable.  I don't even want to look at the hit I took today.   With some low prices out there, things should start to rebound a bit.  (I hope)."
40850,Big Cliff,2007-02-27 22:42:00,6899,"Chill out and relax.  Unless you just bought into the market in the last few weeks you are loosing what you had yesterday but you were gaining at an incredable rate anyway so you have only lost part of what you gained. Anyone who invests should be prepaired to see things like this happen, it will recover! it always does, it's a fact! The biggest mistake you can make is to sell when it is going down and buy when it is going up.  Two years ago the TSX was at about 11,400  It closed yesterday at somewhere around 13,400. If you have been in the market for a while (and if you are going to invest in the market it should be long term) you are still in good shape. If you invest in the market short term you need help or one heck of a lot of luck!"
40853,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-27 22:52:00,2585,good points big cliff.  hold long and prosper works ask warren buffet!!  but you can make money short term also.  its just alot harder to find the gems when you invest short term.  It will be interesting to see what happens the rest of the week.  Cheers!
40857,Frankypro,2007-02-27 23:01:00,63,Gas was 99.9 in the Cambridge area today...prolly didn't have the guts to hit the $ 1.00 mark (looks bad and all)  BUT you know it's going to come in light of today's trading.  Doesn't take them much to infuse panic these days.  Even if it's only their own minds.
40972,bucktail,2007-02-28 01:59:00,1857,I bought yesterday.................. I am serious! DOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
40979,irishfield,2007-02-28 02:21:00,26272,Could be worse Bucktail...you could have done like my wife did a few years back and invested large into a CI mutual fund right after the markets closed...and then immediately after and on the same night Nortel announced their huge 1/4ly loss that turned their stock certificates to toilet paper. Lost 16% in one night. BUT she let it ride....and the same mutual fund is now worth 168% of her original investment.
40986,Guest gbfisher,2007-02-28 02:34:00,0,Losing?   It's only on paper!  Time to throw a few more darts.
41028,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-28 03:51:00,957,"All we lost was house money if we've been invested for any length of time.  Alan Greenspan did his part for today's drop by talking about the end of a cycle and a coming recession.  IMO he's been greatly over rated.  I see him more as a cause of crashes in the market rather than a predictor.  He's had too much power and has played with us at our expens, in many cases.  We seem to all be in the same boat with our investing in the stock market.  We don't have a lot of money and need to bet on the market to make our investments grow.  People with big money go into safer places such as bonds.  They don't have to grow theirs.  Just need to protect it.  China is down again on the 28th and tomorrow's going to be a little early for me to buy.  My wife and I are eligible to buy two Roth IRAs for 2007 at the catchup amount.  I think anyone over 50 can buy a $5000 Roth if they have earned income for the year.  I don't have to sweat the age requirement."
41030,bigfish1965,2007-02-28 04:15:00,3382,Next Monday will be a good 'buy' day.
41077,ccmtcanada,2007-02-28 12:35:00,7971,"Well, China ended up 4% at the end of close today....S&P futures are WAAAY up....they are looking for a big recovery today."
41089,hawkeye,2007-02-28 13:11:00,162,"What goes down will come up eventually, at least that’s what my third wife told me  Bad news yesterday. Alan Greenspan just can’t keep his mouth shut. This guy has had a string of  bad economic calls so it’s a gloomy Greenspan versus a happy Ben Bernanke.   And then the Taliban missed Cheney"
41091,OhioFisherman,2007-02-28 13:19:00,6623,"Just curious, China already has been said to fix the value of their currency, can they fix their stock values? In a dictatorship or communist country how is the real value determined?"
41100,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-28 13:53:00,957,"Armed with blind faith in our global economy I bought 2 Roth IRA first thing this morning with just two clicks on the keyboard.  Just like the guy on TV, except I wasn't charged a fee.  We'll soon know how smart I am.  Or the other thing....................................  Didn't make a big buy because I don't have big money."
