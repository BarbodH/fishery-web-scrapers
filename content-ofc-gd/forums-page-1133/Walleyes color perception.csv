123290,fishindevil,2007-10-14 21:53:00,6254,"I thought this would be an interesting piece of information that all us die-hard walleye guys should know...about how a walleye sees different light in the color spectrum its no wonder that the ones they see the best are my fav colors of crankbaits & worm harnesses....so check it out,im trying to find the chart for musky,and their best color is red they see that the most...."
123293,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-14 21:55:00,1183,That is interesting...thanks for posting that.
123314,Beats,2007-10-14 22:53:00,543,They did a big piece in either Ontario Out of Doors of Outdoors Canada a few years ago about this.  I still have it somewhere but it had the same result that orange was the best colour.
123353,GbayGiant,2007-10-15 00:55:00,1780,"What about white ? I like white and chartreuse, every time I put orange on the damn bass go crazy a steal all my bait,  I like perch patterns for walleye, you got white,green,orange all in there maybe that has something to do with it."
123464,Seaweed,2007-10-15 12:32:00,135,That's kinda like the vision I had one nite in the Seventies at a Supertramp concert.  Wow finally have something in common with the Walleye.
123966,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-16 13:54:00,0,Very Interesting. Orange is my best colour for walleye also.
123981,pigeonfisher,2007-10-16 14:18:00,696,That looks like it would show you where to put different baits depending on where the Walleye are in the water?
123987,Roy,2007-10-16 14:27:00,13728," The reason white is a good 'colour' is that white is the combination of all colors of light. In other words, the color white is seen when the red, green and blue channels all send signals to the brain."
123990,Terry,2007-10-16 14:29:00,14456,in different light conditions and water  depths colours and the way fish perceive them change.. so knowing  that info  on the chart is only half the puzzle...plus shiners would never be bait if colour was the main factor in walleye feeding
124086,GbayGiant,2007-10-16 20:31:00,1780,"Good point Roy, ya a crome shiner is always good to since it would reflect all colors."
124087,douG,2007-10-16 20:33:00,2693,"Steve, the angle of the colour bars don't indicate anything, just their relative length.  But, you've probably hear that before."
124109,irishfield,2007-10-16 21:38:00,26272,Thanks Shawn...but it doesn't mean they correlate a colour that they see better with food. I see a red canoe from a further distance on the lake than say green one...but it don't mean I want to eat it. LOL
124263,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-17 03:37:00,0,same color where ever I go. From 50 to 7 fow.......works very very well...
