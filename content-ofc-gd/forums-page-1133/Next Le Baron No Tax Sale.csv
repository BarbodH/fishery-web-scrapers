124457,LeXXington,2007-10-17 20:01:00,1928,I always go to LB's and another big box store.. I price compare.  LB's is still small enough that you do not have to search around for help.  No tax sale is over christmas

I'm even told BPS can't bring Shimano stuff up from their US warehouse, it has to be bought from Canadian distrubution...BUT that said they don't stop them from shipping to Ontario Customers...my Calcutta700B just arrived from BPS online order service in the USA. They bulk ship to the border and then Xpress post it out of Windsor so no extra surprise at the post office when you pick it up..BUT my online order was $301.99US with the $22 shipping charge in. Now that it's here..the slip in the box is the original $301.99 + $29.40 Duty + $18.56 GST for a total of $349.95 The numbers don't add up %age wise to the value and I also presume this is still US funds that are being billed to my card...that the banks will do their magic and make 4% on doing the exchange. Still cheaper than the over $500 it would cost me anywhere in Canada right now. I believe in supporting our economy, but it's darn hard to do so at these prices. Just be cautious of what you are ordering online and if it includes taxes/duties etc or not. Stuff that's made offshore does have an import duty of usually 4.5% on it + the 8% PST and 6% GST.  Correction...thefishinhole.com out in Alberta has lowered their prices quite a bit I see. This is the current cost in Canada for the 700B so I'm still saving $90 or so and if they were in Ontario there'd be another 8% on top!

124461,fishinggeek,2007-10-17 20:09:00,325,"Wow I thought it was such a simple question!  Thanks for everyone's info and opinion.  I will definitely be looking into Cabelas now.  I just assumed the shipping would wipe out any savings that could be had but I should have looked into it myself.  I see how small retailers sometimes must charge more money, but as a consumer, I don't feel I should pay so much more for the exact same product.  And as far as fishing advice and spots and stuff like that, that is why I come onto here, watch shows, read magazines, have fishing friends, and get experience.  I know they are local, but personally I would not pay for fishing advice, which is really what I am doing if choose to buy tackle at such inflated prices from local stores.  That is just my opinion though, and I fully respect others who choose otherwise."
124462,mooseroo,2007-10-17 20:12:00,80," Hey cranks bait,  Thanks for the comments. I grumble about the prices up here as much as anyone but I do understand the retailers can't instantly shift their prices. It's the smart retailer that knows the point in time where they can make up for this loss by dropping prices at just the right time to attract a new larger customer base with price cuts, cover the costs,  and gain on the customer upswing.  Have your suppliers prices for next year started to reflect the changing dollar? If not, I'd start harping on them to cut prices. They need to do the same with their producers."
124388,Gerritt,2007-10-17 16:09:00,6129,"In the News......  Canadian retailers should lower prices, consumers, bankers say  Wednesday, October 17, 2007 - 09:04 AM By: Jaime Pulfer and 680News staff     Toronto - You've no doubt heard the advertising sell-line ""We pass the savings on to you!""  No retailer has ever attracted a single customer by saying, ""We're keeping bigger profits to ourselves!""  But it appears that's what they'll be doing despite the financial windfall from the high dollar.  With the dollar soaring and retailers sitting on their highest profits in years, you might anticipate some price trimming for the upcoming shopping season.  Yes, you might. But it likely won't happen.  Consumers questioned at Union Station Wednesday morning say it would definitely help if retailers on this side of the border would adjust their prices to reflect the lofty loonie.  Retailers like Sears Canada, Lulu Lemon and Reitman's say they don't plan to cut prices, suggesting the cost of doing business in this country means those prices will stay the same. Some insist their prices are already in line with those of their American counterparts.  It may be holiday shopping time, but a National Bank financial report says if retailers don't make a few adjustments, there will be no way to prevent Canadian shoppers from running for the border.      Count me amongst those that refuse to be gouged.. want to make money? be fair.... pretty simple... great service only goes so far, especially with the middle class shrinking more and more every year...Negotiate better prices from your suppliers and pass the savings forward.. Retailers are reporting record Profits... think it is from cost cutting measures?? it is a direct result of the buying power of our dollar... companies like Sears, FutureShop, BestBuy are buying stock on a weekly if not daily basis to replenish inventory... are we seeing those savings??  Until we do I will do whatever it takes to keep more money in my pocket  Sorry if some of the small retailers cant compete but that is the reality in todays global market... But MANY MANY Small retailers are still surviving .... in fact I have seen small retailers with better prices that large retailers on more then a couple occasions..   I am just tired of being screwed pretty simple.  Gerritt."

124433,tonyb,2007-10-17 18:12:00,1637," Agreed CB, but aside from the recent strong dollar, prices are still WAY more than what can be had from the U.S.  Example: I wanted to purchase 2 Shimano 4500 Baitrunners for Carp fishing earlier this year (4 months ago).  Price at local tackle shop $179 each - Price in U.S. $109 each.  No dollar difference in history can match a $70 difference for the exact same product  Cleary something isn't right.  Same with the Rapala example I gave in my last thread $5.99 in U.S. - $9.99 at local tackle shop...  I agree about the service comment, but 99% of the time I know exactly what I want to buy and 50% or more of the time when I drive to the local tackle shop they are out of stock on the things I want or are awaiting their next bulk shipment.  They can have the best customer service in the world, but what good is it if they don't stock the product that I specifically went there for?  Brick & Mortar businesses are great, but they need to embrace and adapt to the efficiency of the Internet business model at the same time.  Offer your service and local knowledge as a bonus, but compete with other businesses for our hard earned dollars.  All that service and local knowledge is useless if your buyers refuse to enter your doors because they can buy a new rod or reel with the savings they can achieve by doing business over the border.  It would be great to hear from tackle retailers on this.  Are you guys being had by Canadian tackle distributors or what?!  Tony"
