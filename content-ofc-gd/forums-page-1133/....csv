123530,john vail,2007-10-15 15:26:00,67,"Glen, its been years but we used to go to the redneck riveria , as a foamily we used to go over Easter and camp right on the dunes, used to catch Pompano right off the beach, and back then we would come back from the charter with a ton of snapper, Id show you some pictures, but I dont have my shirt on."
123567,Badger Shark,2007-10-15 17:32:00,291,"Wow great report!  My mother lived down there in Pass Christian Mississippi until hurrican Katrina destroyed it and everything she had.  I remeber always looking forward to my anual trips down there.  I always love to fish there from the shore and out at the rigs.  Lots of redfish, little tunnie and many many other types of fish, always a good fight when you get a shark on.  I really miss it there.  We were last there this past winter and it looks like people are starting to get things going again but still alot of cleanup to do, many things still left the way they were when the Hurricane hit.  Thanks for the report hope there are more, brings back memories!  Don"
