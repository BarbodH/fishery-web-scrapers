124209,Bear,2007-10-17 01:46:00,106,"just wondering if the folks on this board does an ice fishing get together.  thought i remember something from a couple years ago, just wonder if it still goes on and when and where  would like to meet up with some OFC'ers someday, already thinking meeting up at Lakeair next summer  Bear"
124327,ccmtcanada,2007-10-17 12:23:00,7971,"There is an annual ""Fishing for Tyler"" fund raising event that takes place in February on Lake Simcoe that many OFNers participate in.  Last winter I think there was an impromtu ice fishing mini-G2G on the Bay of Quinte."
124370,Terry,2007-10-17 15:01:00,14456,"yeah, the yearly Misfish icefishing M&G turned into the ""Fishing for Tyler"" fund raising event most years there are G2Gs on the ice but last year conditions were not very good , so they never happened hopefully something will happen this year I would love to see a willow beach/jackson point  area whitefish  G2G for OFC if conditions are good"
124382,fishindevil,2007-10-17 15:37:00,6254,"We could all go to deseronto and all stay at the bayview inn...hgas about 40or so rooms ,and fish all around forester island and around the big brige are in the deep 25ft trench....its a great ice-fishing spot and for people that dont have a sled its a 10min walk...that would be fun too....just an idea....cheers"
