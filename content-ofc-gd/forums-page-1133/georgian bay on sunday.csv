124177,mikeh,2007-10-17 00:56:00,824,"I decided to do a little musky fishing Sunday on Georgian Bay. Arrived at the Victoria Harbour launch at about 8:30 and decided that the water wasn't deep enough to launch , so I decided to launch at Pier 69 in Waubeshene ($15).The weather forecast was for 5 km winds and they were right as you could tell by this first picture.  it was like this until around noon and then the wind picked up a bit.  The first 3 hours I trolled then did some casting around some shoals and had no luck. Moved to a more sheltered area from the wind , I was casting my spinnerbait in 8 feet of water over a weed bed and this 38 inch Musky attacked my bait right beside the boat. Some people fishing the area took these next two photos and e-mailed them to me. Had one other fish hit in the same area beside the boat but I missed it and that was it for the day.  "
