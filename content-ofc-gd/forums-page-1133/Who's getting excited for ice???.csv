124557,Badger Shark,2007-10-18 03:05:00,291,I hope its like last year and we will be out on the boat on Jan. 7 or later again.  I HATE WINTER!
124302,jeffw,2007-10-17 11:53:00,267,I've noticed that walmart and bass pro shops are getting all the ice gear out already. Hopefully a month and a half and I will be on a little splake lake. Anyone else looking forward to ice. Cheers Jeff
124303,ccmtcanada,2007-10-17 11:54:00,7971,"Ummm....lemme see.....lemme think....  NOPE!!! LOL.  I tried ice fishing for the first time last year....first time without a hut on Simcoe...the second with a heated hut on Scugog.  Cant say I liked it.  But...I'm sure by early Feb, I'll be going thru fishing withdrawal again and I'll be out there....LOL"
124305,joefish,2007-10-17 11:56:00,165,The only ice I'm thinking about right now are the cubes that will be in my drinks tomorrow when I get to Hawaii!!!!
124308,Terry,2007-10-17 12:02:00,14456,no    but when winter does rear it's ugly head   I will make the most of it and enjoy my time fishing  but I don't need to rush it
124315,Riparian,2007-10-17 12:08:00,269,Yes. I look forward to the winter... it cant come soon enough.
124331,irishfield,2007-10-17 12:38:00,26272,58 days of Muskie season left....let me think...NOPE !
124332,lew,2007-10-17 12:42:00,12767,The only ice I get excited about is the stuff that's melting in the spring
124337,Wes Bender,2007-10-17 12:57:00,105,I always look forward to the ice. But not the same ice as most of you. I will be climbing my preferred ice not fishing through it. Gave up ice fishing long ago.
124339,wallyboss,2007-10-17 13:02:00,1095,"The sooner, the better!!!! Hopefully we have a long cold winter this year not like last year.  I did about 100 hours less of ice fishing compared to the previous year. 2 years ago I put in 240 hours on the ice"
124341,Moosebunk,2007-10-17 13:06:00,3970,"I'm kind of looking forward to a break from fishing.  But once that starts and I'm about a week into it, I'll be looking forward to March.  Everything inbetween is bitter cold."
124342,Golfisher,2007-10-17 13:10:00,586,"If it means next spring is coming closer, sure, why not get excited for ice?"
124356,Fishnfiend,2007-10-17 13:39:00,357,Bring on the ice and the snow!
124363,wallyboss,2007-10-17 14:31:00,1095,The less snow we get the more ice we'll have.
124445,jedimaster,2007-10-17 19:33:00,3472,Just picked up my ice fishing companion last night. Alaskan Husky. It will be pulling me and my ice gear out for me. well not this year but next year it will be pulling me. I sold my boat so I am totally read for ice fishing. Although not til I fill my hunting tags though.
124448,Fisherman,2007-10-17 19:42:00,7201,"Like wallyboss said, don't need the snow until later in the season, that crud we've had over the last couple seasons is bad, a couple inches of ice then a foot of snow, a bit of rain to make a crust on top,  gives ""mushing around"" a whole new meaning.  Cars/trucks/snowmobiles and atvs having a beatch of a time getting around."
124450,misfish,2007-10-17 19:47:00,29133,  This from a guy that has a new ATV and  a PLOW to do his drive way. Nice.   Lets get the deer season over first then we can talk about the next season.
124480,wuchikubo,2007-10-17 22:05:00,1114,Bring on the cold and ice (I don't need the snow and messy stuff in the urban areas though)! Hopefully a nice cold season will help stop or at least slow down the winter evapouration of the great lakes. The water levels are ridiculously low.
124485,Muskieman,2007-10-17 22:28:00,2472,"WWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!   HELL YHEA!!!  I'm so dang' anxious...just got a new Jiffy 10""...new to me 1 season old for 100.00$  I'm usually the ice tester out on the little lakes for specs and splake....  Gonna put my hut out on Nipissing before opening hopefully if we have a normal winter...?  or i'll go out in the boat ON JANUARY 1ST LIKE LAST YEAR..  can't wait to cross nip in the truck with the family."
124488,fishdawg,2007-10-17 22:44:00,912,what Terry said
124489,irishfield,2007-10-17 22:44:00,26272,Dang Jed...thar ya go scarin me with them thar pictures again !
124491,addict,2007-10-17 22:53:00,475,"have u been eatin paint chips??????.ill take open water any day, fish those dirty tribs till they freeze over.then maybe ill think about ice fishing.hope winter is the same as last year.steelheading was great.when we finally got ice it was a waste of time haullin the hut out on the lake.only made 3 or 4 trips out to the hut.did go to the bog in a desperate attempt at the dreaded pail fishing.dont get me wrong ice fishing can be fun but its not my cup of tea i just do it because i cant go without fishing for to long.all work and no fish makes me a dull boy."
124499,Shelley Cooper,2007-10-17 23:02:00,394,"Yaaaaa, bring on the COLD... but keep most of the snow...  Once Lady Simcoe is FROZEN.. I can go fishing ANYTIME...."
124523,troutologist,2007-10-18 00:12:00,951,  I hear ya I cant wait to ice fish for trout. hope the 1st time out on the splake lake has more ice than last year. That got a bit sketchy.
124537,Bear,2007-10-18 01:09:00,106,Boat sat on the trailer way too often this season (luv that motor of mine  )  Bring on the ICE  :thumbsup_anim:
124549,kemper,2007-10-18 02:04:00,2232,cold weather? SURE rain? PLEASE steel? BRING IT ON!  ice? please no!
