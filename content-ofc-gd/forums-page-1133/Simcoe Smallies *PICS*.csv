Being so calm today, the main lake was open to fish and we werent so restricted to the north end.  We all started dragging tubes, and Brent picked up his first Simcoe smallie, about a 4 pounder.    We got onto some good fish in deep water, 32-42 feet fishing breaklines on a mid lake shoal. Most came on tubes and jigging spoons.   Brent with his first Simcoe experience.   Me and my cousin show some off   Cal, the spoon master."

123832,007,2007-10-16 02:20:00,537,Some great looking smallies.  Congrats!  One question - how far south in Lake Simcoe (roughly) can you catch decent smallies like that?  I'm guessing renting a boat from the south end (Cooks Bay/Barrie) means a long boat ride? (I guess that's two questions! LOL  007
123833,stasbrute,2007-10-16 02:27:00,206,"Very nice, good job !!!!"
123838,steverowbotham,2007-10-16 02:34:00,1800,"cooks bay is relatively close to good smallie fishing, once you pass roaches point, you're there.  cooks also has trophy largies (saw an 8 pounder caught there this summer by a 14 year old from shore) and trophy pike."
123885,misfish,2007-10-16 10:05:00,29133,"  You know you can have 120 boats on simcoe and maybe see 2-3 boats all day.  When Im out prefishing,I push the invisable wonder women plane button."
123935,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-16 13:10:00,0,Nice bag of smallies.!!One question.... Whats a breakline????
123947,trapshooter,2007-10-16 13:24:00,1234,"  A breakline is where the depth changes relatively quickly.  Eg. ""I fished the 20-25  foot breakline""  A breakline can be gradual but it's usually the one's where the depth drops quickly that fish associate with.  Nice Smallies too, btw.  Good luck in the tournament fellas."
123998,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-16 15:00:00,0, Oh so its the line of a drop off? Thanks!
124007,trapshooter,2007-10-16 15:32:00,1234,"Yeah, drop off = breakline"
