124389,mikeymikey,2007-10-17 16:10:00,376,Hello.  I am just wondering if this is it for pier (river mouth) fishing for salmon? Can I still fish there for different types of trouts soon? now? or Should I pack up my pier casting gears away already?  I really haven't fished at the pier as much as I wanted and time has already gone past.  Any informations would be helpful.  Thank you!

124405,skz,2007-10-17 16:55:00,15,Didnt you ask this last week?
124406,Bassloadingzone,2007-10-17 17:00:00,32,"Some said last week its eems they havent come in yet, but they must have by now, if they have the numbers were very low this year"
124434,mikeymikey,2007-10-17 18:12:00,376, I just realized it.  I thought it was a different forum.  Ooops!
124435,mikeymikey,2007-10-17 18:16:00,376,Well... all the major runs are done during our unusually warm?hot? end of summer.  I have to say... I had the best time during end of Auguest & early September.  I thought it was fall fishing but this year was more like end of summer!
124497,addict,2007-10-17 23:01:00,475,east tribs a done except for straglers.but those bows are here and will get better with the cold.
124548,mikeymikey,2007-10-18 01:55:00,376,"One more question...  Do these trouts, Steelhead, Rainbow & Browns... do these fish stage by the river mouth like salmon does and run up at certain condition? Or do these trouts just slowly & randomly come up the river?  Could you just give me a quick info on it?  Thank you."
124595,ccmtcanada,2007-10-18 12:06:00,7971,Trout will stage and then run when there's a good rain.
