Feeling somewhat hungry, he sat down and looked over the menu .  * Tourist: $5 * Broiled Missionary: $10.00 * Fried Explorer: $15.00 * Baked Liberal or Grilled Conservative: $100.00  The cannibal called the waiter over and asked, 'Why such a price difference for the  Politician?' The cook replied, ""Have you ever tried to clean one? They're so full of shiet, it takes  all morning."""
