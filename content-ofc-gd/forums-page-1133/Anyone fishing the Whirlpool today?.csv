I'm in Niagara falls today for some work seminars but may have an hour or so of free time, I won't be fishing but was looking to see if any OFNer were around to say ""hi"" to. I've never fished the whirlpool before and may have my kids with me today.  If you are still fishing around 3 pm to 5 pm, I may look for you.  Stan"
