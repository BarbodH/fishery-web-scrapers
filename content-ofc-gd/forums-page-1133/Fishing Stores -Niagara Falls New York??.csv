124409,Fishn Technishn,2007-10-17 17:12:00,198,"Misfish, joefish, Fismaster thanks. Never heard of Gander Mountain! Don't seem to have much in the way of info on the web. Is there much emphasis on fishing/boats etc?  FT"
124411,bpsbassman,2007-10-17 17:16:00,941,I don't think you'd be disappointed in Gander Mountain.  Much like a small BPS. Worth the visit.
124422,tipupesox,2007-10-17 17:45:00,167,"Gander has hunting, fishing, camping and outdoor apparrel.  They probably have some good deals on hunting, Fall gear.  I would say it is the best all around outdoors store in the Buffalo area for outdoorsman.  About a 20-30 minute drive from the casino, take Robert Moses Parkway to I190 to the I290 and get off on Colvin Blvd.  Tom"
124425,mattyk,2007-10-17 17:55:00,2110,gander has a real nice fishing section.
124436,misfish,2007-10-17 18:32:00,29133,And you can pick up the guns and see how they feel without an attendant . Wow only in AMERICA. LOL
124446,lazybum,2007-10-17 19:34:00,142,I was at Gander Mountain two weekends ago and found they re-organized the store.  Inventory of their fishing stuff might be a bit low at this time of the year.  Was looking for fishing line and the rack didn't have as much selection as previously.  End of season I guess. But lots of hunting stuff.
