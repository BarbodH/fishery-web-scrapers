On the way to the lake I've seen nice colors of the sunrise     Sunrise from the boat launch     Fishing was tough I've managed to land only 2 pikes   (worst performance this season ), lost one on the ""long distance release""  No pictures of pikes due to a fact that...........Oh forget it ( I was on the party on Saturday night)  Anyway,  cedar planks pike is very tasty"

You still landed 2 pike, gotta look at it that way.  Sometimes the LDR is a good thing.  You don't get yourself and your boat all smelly;)"
