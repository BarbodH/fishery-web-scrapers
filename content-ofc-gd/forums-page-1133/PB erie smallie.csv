123903,bucktail,2007-10-16 11:30:00,1857,"Beauty fish with nice colours dude! Congrats! It seems to be the year of the smallmouth. A few interesting articles in In-Fisherman over the last year  on global warming and smallmouth growth rates and range expansion over the last 15 years. Coupled with a good ctach and release ethic, I have to say its the Golden Age Of Smallies!"
