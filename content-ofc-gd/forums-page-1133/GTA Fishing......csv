123255,Billy - Curtiss,2007-10-14 19:40:00,241,"Hey gang. I just recently got back into fishing and was wondering if anyone knows of any great places to fish in and around the downtown Toronto area. I don't have a boat, so heading out into Lake Ontario isn't really an option. I've tried Grenadier Pond for bass and pike to no avail and I also tried the Humber River a bit south of Old Mill with much the same result. I'm primarily interested in bass. Any insight that anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated."
123301,FishHeadRic,2007-10-14 22:11:00,226,"Hey Billy,  I could set you up with some spots to try out. Are you from TO or did you just move there? How much did you fish before? Ya up for a little tassle with some nice sized pike?   FHR"
123404,sharper,2007-10-15 02:49:00,279,Try Humber bay park west/east. There are some bass lurking around as well as pike. Also Leslie spit but bring a bike for that! I learned the hard way.

124037,Billy - Curtiss,2007-10-16 17:15:00,241,"Thanks for the input gang! FHR, I'm totally into fishing for pike. I'm 34 and fished a fair amount when I was a teenager. I've been in Toronto close to a decade, but grew up in the North Bay area and fished Lake Nosbonsing mostly. I just really got back into fishing after a 10 day trip this summer 100 km north of Webbwood near the headwaters of the west arm of the Spanish River. Talk about pike fishing! And not a soul in sight it's so remote."
124065,FishHeadRic,2007-10-16 19:07:00,226,"OK Billy, Give me a bit to find my old pics and maps and I'll shoot ya a pm of some of the prime shoreline spots for this time of year.  FHR"
