Planning to head up to Stony on Sunday and was looking for any rental advice, I've rented from Burleigh Island lodge before and while the boats and people were nice they're a bit pricey so I'm hoping someone can recommend another place (not a huge deal but hey, can't blame a guy for being cheap right  ).  More importantly I'm also looking for any advice on October patterns on Stony - I was there a couple times earlier in the summer but without a whole lot of success and I know the rules will be a different this time of year.  We're hoping to find a muskie or two and some smallies.  If anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it (PM me if you'd like and I'll swear to any level of secrecy you want)  Thanks in advance everyone  Sean"
