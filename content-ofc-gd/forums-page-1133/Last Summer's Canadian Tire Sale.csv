123872,Stern Rules,2007-10-16 05:34:00,342,Did anyone have problems with last years Abu Garcia rod and reels Canadian Tire had on? It was the green ones. I gave my brother one and he said about six inches of the tip broke off. Has this happened to anyone else? I gave it to him this summer and it wasn't used 'til then and he didn't use it that much yet. Just wonderin'?

123905,Blake,2007-10-16 11:33:00,418,Take the rod back to CTC.  They have a one year warranty from the manufacturer.

124158,Hooked,2007-10-17 00:09:00,891,"Bought that combo and only have a problem with the reel, the drag will loosen itself, so I gotta check it often and tighten drag."
124186,Mike Pike,2007-10-17 01:05:00,1332,"My cousin picked one up.  Wish I had too 'cuz it's terrific for what they had the combo priced at.  Anyhoo, he doesn't fish anywhere near as smuch as I do but I know he hasn't had a problem with his."
