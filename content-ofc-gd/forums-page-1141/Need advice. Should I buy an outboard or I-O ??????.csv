Sorry I took a little longer to reply this time. I came down with a nasty cold yesterday and am under the influence of Neo Citron right now. Thanks to everyone here I learned a fair bit and can hopefully make a better,more informed choice. . I guess now (thanks to you guys) I'm leaning towards either an 80's bowrider with an outboard or a 16 foot aluminum with a decent outboard. I guess a Starcraft aluminum bowrider with a good sized outboard would fit the bill very well. Anyway, thanks guys. IF anyone out there has more advice/suggestions please don't be shy."

OMC = Garbage Mercruiser much better, and more power/reliability in the price range your looking at. The one thing people are missing here is a 16 foot alluminum with a 50 or 60hp OB is a great fishing rig no doubt, but try finding one in decent condition for the price he is looking at.  My only thing is that in the sub 5k market a late to mid 80's bowrider is likely gonna be in better shape as far as the outboard goes.  You may want to consider just buying a brand new or near new 25hp OB and buying a poopty old 14foot alluminum then in a few years get a new 16 foot alluminum.  .  My boat is a bigger boat better for trollling, or casting from the front. The rear has a casting deck and I have fished with a partner in a few Derbies with no complaints from the guy n the rear.  If you do get a bowrider in the early to mid 80's its definatly gonna be deeper than mine. The picture is a bit decieving. My 6 year daughter has no problem fishing from the back.  Yes you don't want to drive around all day with the motor trimmed right up if you can help it. Not only can it wear the gimbal and Ujoints, but if your that shallow you will be sucking up dirt and crud into the water pump.  When you get shallow switch to your bow mount trolling motor thats what its for. When I launch mine I hop on the trolling motor and drive away from the dock and start the engine away from the dock.  Get a bow mount trolling motor for whatever you buy. They are great when your fishing in any type of boat.  If you want to go with an OB there are plenty of mid 80's Bowriders available with OB's instead or IO's.  You should be ok towing a 17 foot fiberglass check your manual for weight ratings, you may have issues on wet or gravel ramps though without a 4x4.  Front wheel drive is actually better to get out of the water than rear wheel drive. Since the front wheels rarely get wet, and if they do your screwed anyway.  One thing to keep in mind.  Alluminum boat are like Diapers. Everyone starts out in them and everyone ends up in them in the end.  Fiberglass boats are fun and look better, but alluminums are just plain better for most types of fishing and are far easier to launch and draft much shallower"

But still, its cheap, and I use  it at least twice a week, from early april until well into december every year.  When I bought the boat, it was decked out, but a tiller. Its still a tiller, I just took some of the stuff out that made it look nice......I just wreck all that stuff doign what I do in it....lol. Duck hunting late in the fall will wreck a nice boat quick! You could call it a utility  now.....but with a nice floor and lots of storage. I don't need anything bigger or better.....I'd just wreck it anyways.  Its just a starcraft.......16wb I think.....can't remember....I painted over it  Its deep and wide, rated for a 40, but the same hull with a console is rated for a 60.  Edit: There was one just like mine for sale in the classifieds, but a console.  Sinker"
