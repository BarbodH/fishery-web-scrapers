118595,tonyb,2007-09-28 18:56:00,1637,"Yeah I hear ya, me and a buddy played through the whole campaign in 2 nights co-operatively over Xbox live.  Sounds like your boys are pretty hardcore to finish it so quickly  The good thing is that there are so many online features, the game won't get old for a long, long time.  Lexxington, you're going to love the storyline, all the loose ends get tied up and a great twist at the end, but I won't say anymore  Tony"
