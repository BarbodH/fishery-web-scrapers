He had found this great field and with the farmers permission we set up before dawn... If you read my previous post from the weekend you are aware that I have this thing about learning and watching... when it comes to shooting I wasn't doing so well.  This morning changed all that.  I figured I had paid enough attention and today , waste of shells or not, I was going to shoot...  The pictures are not great, but atleast they tell the story.  Thanks Zoe for fetching so beautifully today! And Thank you to Steve for your patience and being my Guide... I couldn't have picked a more patient person.  Although next time do you have to bring so many decoys???LOL      It is a start and helps with the motivation to have actually managed to drop a bird from the sky...now more practice for me!  Squirls maybe??  Cheers,  Jen"
