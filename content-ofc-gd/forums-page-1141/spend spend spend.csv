118672,Terry,2007-09-28 22:05:00,14456,"I have been looking at the SHIMANO Calais DC Digital Control Baitcasting Reel, thinking I really need one but them I found out they cost with tax in about 900 bucks 900 buck CND...that's nuts  they are only about 700 bucks in the States....like that's going to help      well I found a new one on Ebay but the Japanese model same thing but the manual is in Japanese...I could live with that  and the starting bid is 399.99...well that's well under half price...I could do that   but no one has bid on it...so I wait a few days..still no one bid..I put in min. bid...aday later  and just a few hours to go and no one else has bid I am thinking, did I read it wrong..is it a different reel or are they only selling the case for the reel..why is it so cheap   so the last few miutes you keep refreshing to make sure you are the high bid....   dang I got it  for the price I wanted plus shipping and ins.  so then..what will I have to pay for duty and tax at the border....  well today at lunch I got it at the post office..I had an extra 200 bucks in my pocket..just in case   the lady said 16 dollars please for duty....  that was it it was the reel I thought it was  the reel to beat all reels and I go it here for under 450 CND..what a deal....  but why do I really need this thing.............    now I need to tell the wife  don't I  well"
118676,motv8tr,2007-09-28 22:16:00,2587,"Well Terry, no matter how it works it sure looks pretty   Good luck with the Mrs.  Maureen"
118677,misfish,2007-09-28 22:18:00,29133,"Thats a great gift for the wife,even if she dosent need it.LOL  Nice one bud."
118680,glen,2007-09-28 22:29:00,2641,Terry it is the wrong hand.  It is used cause there is line on it.  Do you want to sell it.  How much do you want.  I will give you $10.
118682,JohnF,2007-09-28 22:33:00,3494, Yes! You do!  It was on special at BassPro for $29.99 wasn't it?  JF
118684,SlowPoke,2007-09-28 22:35:00,2984,"Terry, Be very careful with those DC reels, those tiny little built in computers are prone to hackers. I'm not worthy of a reel like that! I had a hard enough time justyfing the cash for the Curado DHSV but I'm glad I did. I'm sure you will feel the same way when you have a chance to use your new Calais. -Brian"
118686,wuchikubo,2007-09-28 22:41:00,1114,"It's a Japanese chip inside and isn't region coded for North America so it won't cast properly without recoding.  Being such a nice guy, I'll trade you a non-computerized model for it.    LOL!"
118687,ccmtcanada,2007-09-28 22:42:00,7971,"900 bucks??  Wow...for that price I'd want it to choose my lure, locate the fish, and hook it automatically.....I'd like to still fight the fish though....want fishing to still be a sport.  LOL  Great deal....good for you for shopping around!"
118691,Terry,2007-09-28 22:50:00,14456,"ahhhh,,yeah,,thanks for your concern.....LOL  here is a clip of lindner casting it into heavy winds without thumbing the spool not even when it hits the water   video of my reel...mine mine mine"
118699,Raf,2007-09-28 23:10:00,3495,"well it sure is pretty.. and it sounds like you got a good deal.  but.. forgive my ignorance, what is so speshul about having a computer chip in it?"
118700,tbayboy,2007-09-28 23:12:00,1497,As someone who's using bait casters for the first time this year all I can say after watching Lindner in that video is where the hell do I get one?  Thats pretty impressive stuff even if they do list for $800+
118702,irishfield,2007-09-28 23:13:00,26272,But Terry...what the hell you gonna do with that at Quinte in November...........
118706,Terry,2007-09-28 23:22:00,14456,"most reels cast at 15,000 rmp this thing will cast up to  50,000 rmp the chip adjusts the speed of the spool 1000+ times a second so it will not spin faster then the lure is moving = it can cast 300ft...which is unheard of.. and you can play xbox 360 games on it.........ok  maybe not...LOL  it will stay home when I go to Quinte.....other toys for that trip"
118708,ranger520vx,2007-09-28 23:27:00,164,kewlest thing is you can comb your hair staring at it just like a mirror.  VERY NICE!
118709,SlowPoke,2007-09-28 23:28:00,2984,"You can email with it. As I interprete it, the digital control is an active brake system for the spool. Most have a variable braking system which is passive and ultimately shortens your casts. The DC gives you brakes when you need it most to prevent backlash and eases off to prolong your casts."
118716,irishfield,2007-09-28 23:54:00,26272,But Terry....you're getting so damn old can you reel in 300 feet at a time ?
118720,Terry,2007-09-29 00:07:00,14456,sure I can reel it in  once or twice a day.........getting old...dang.........I try not
118724,lazybum,2007-09-29 00:23:00,142, Sounds a lot like my wife and her shoe purchases... many many pairs of shoes.  Oh and let us know if it works as advertised.
118727,Zib,2007-09-29 00:32:00,369,I could buy a lot of Lucky Crafts with $450.  Me jealous. Enjoy your new toy.
118735,pigeonfisher,2007-09-29 01:06:00,696,does it drive you to the fishing hole?
118744,JohnF,2007-09-29 01:44:00,3494, Nah. It just tells you if you made a wrong turn along the road.  JF
118752,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-29 02:17:00,698,WOW! Sweet deal! I've been dying for one of those. Have to save my pennies
118760,Golfisher,2007-09-29 02:46:00,586,That is one hell of a deal!
118776,danbo,2007-09-29 03:22:00,2646,"Dang, I thought my Daiwa Advantage ST was special! I got reel envy now!! Fish on bro!"
