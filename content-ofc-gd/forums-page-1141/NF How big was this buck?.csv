118666,chilli,2007-09-28 21:38:00,199,How big do you think this buck was? The entire skeleton was there so I'm guessing it was either wounded or died of old age.   Dan

118717,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-28 23:56:00,835,Yep depends on if he was raised on fruits and vegetables or acorns and rocks.
118830,bucktail,2007-09-29 13:14:00,1857,Only thing I can tell is that it probably went in the 140's rack size that is.....body who knows?
118915,chilli,2007-09-29 20:31:00,199,Actually I thought the thickness of the skull would be a good indicator. I've found a few of these on Navy Island (complete skeletons) but this one seemed like it had allot more mass than most. A buddy told me the best indicator is the wear on the teeth but as you've pointed out it depends on the diet.  This one isn't from Navy Island however. I found it near my tree stand (200 yards) in Fort Erie. Thanks for your replies.  Dan
