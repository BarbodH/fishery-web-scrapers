118367,ntgrk,2007-09-28 01:27:00,16,WHAT EXCACTLY does gear ratio mean I just prchased a sahara 2500fb with a gear ratio of  6.2:1 . What does this mean?   thanks
118377,vance,2007-09-28 01:45:00,719,My guess would be that for every turn of the handle the spool turns 6.2 times which is a fast return.   vance
118384,Pigeontroller,2007-09-28 02:00:00,2793,"The higher the gear ratio, the faster the retrieve. The lower the ratio, the more power you have. For example, a 4:1 levelwind is a good trolling reel, 6:1 is great for burning baits fast. If you check out a Bass pro catalogue or Cabelas they quite often  give the line retrieve in inches per turn of the handle for the different reels."
118385,stuntman,2007-09-28 02:01:00,96,I am pretty sure that 6.2:1 gear ration means that for every gear ration question you ask you will get 1 good reply and 6.2 replies giving you the gears.
118446,OhioFisherman,2007-09-28 05:51:00,6623,"Different setups between a spinning and casting reel, revolving spool on a casting reel, fixed on a spinning the bail assembly moves to wind line, gear ratio deal is the same though, just a different method.  Sahara is a decent reel, 2500 a popular size for all around fishing, 6.2 to 1 higher up as retrieve ratios go, faster retrieve, 1 turn of the handle should equal 6.2 turns of the bail assembly."
118459,Terry,2007-09-28 10:29:00,14456,"Yup 1 turn of the handle , 6.2 turns of the spool  but that doesn't tell the whole story on gear ratio , it's the number of inches of line it takes up per turn of the handle that really counts and that depends on the size of the spool plus gear ratio"
118555,Tybo,2007-09-28 16:47:00,1373,One turn of the handle X 2 turns of the pinion gear X 6 turns of the bevel gear or spool.
118587,JohnF,2007-09-28 17:59:00,3494, And the amount of line on the spool?  JF
