118419,irishfield,2007-09-28 03:33:00,26272,"Thought I’d break the summer down into Months and post what we’ve been up to up North. We had a great summer, with Leah only taking ill a couple times during the rainy/cold times in July and earlier in September.  I succeeded in doing some firsts, both on the fishing front and renovation fronts. Taught my two young nephews (Leah’s sisters kids) how to cast successfully and safely. One even caught a “BIG” rock bass from around the dock. Fished with my 81 year old mother and my 50+ year old sister for the FIRST time in my life. Targeted Lake Trout all season and got pretty good at figuring out where they go when it’s calm and when the wind blows. Had numerous guests up this season and not one went home without putting a Laker in the boat…or four for that matter. I learned how to split rock to any thickness I desired and hell I even managed to make it stay on a wall. May not be to Bricknblock standards…but I’m happy with my creation. Thanks to a good friend/customer (another reason why you should treat customers like they’re a king), who picked me up at the end of my dock and flew me into the back country one day,  I finally got a comfortable enough feeling to explore the back country solo and over the last couple weeks did some exploring and fishing on the back lakes of Temagami.  Here’s the month of July  Got heavy into ripping the living room apart.     Came out one evening and found this little guy left behind by his mother. A few hours later he/she was gone again and appeared again late in September eating in the front yard every night at exactly 7pm with his mother/father.   Slapping down some ceramic floor for under the wood stove. I think I get to go fishing soon….    Teaching my nephews how to cast their new spincast reels. Jim at Dad’s outfitters deserves some thanks here. Took the lads over there for a couple rods, line, etc that totaled 85+ dollars and he asked me for $35 !      and their mother wonders why she’s broke !  Think he’s happy ?   Had the father-in-law out on the arm when this nasty looking think dropped down like a submarining Muskie….   Common site on Temagami…I’ve seen as many as 42 loon swimming together out on the open lake.   How many of you have a wife that will climb on a roof….let alone lower the chimney liner down the masonary so you can attach the tee thru the wall inside?   Father-in-law didn’t have a very good hold on this one…lol    Drove home with the father-in-law so I could get my airplane. Took a better shot of Sandy Island while crossing Nippissing for you Marty!   Back out on the arm downrigging with my younger (than my older one) sister   waiting for her fish…   and here’s the first   and with both she reeled in   and Dang they were good! "
