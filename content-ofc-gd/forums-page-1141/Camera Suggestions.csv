118645,JohnF,2007-09-28 20:36:00,3494, It occurs to me that this part of the post comes off like some kind of bragging. It wasn't meant to sound that way. Truth is most of those setups were purchased very very cheap (and feel like it) or I got 'em used somehow.  Fiddling with mechanical things is a hobby of mine. It's fun trying to make a cheap reel work something like decently and then to match that reel with a cheap rod to get a somewhere near decently balanced setup. One of my favourite combos is a $9.95 reel bought from a bin at Dick's Sports mounted on a $10 rod found in a clearance sale at Gander Mountain. A little fiddling with the reel to make the drag work better and voila - a pretty nifty & very light rig for peanuts.  It's kinda light in the action but great fun for Bass and panfish.  JF
118698,Moosebunk,2007-09-28 23:05:00,3970,"http://www.panasonic.ca/English/audiovideo...ill/DMCTZ2.asp#   Gone through a few in recent years.  Fuji...... OK but sharpening pics lead to striations in skylines worse than any other.  Weird.  Canon....... OK but crappy image viewer.  More expensive models take nice shots as I'm learning, and have better veiwers.  Pentax Optio....... garbage.  9-12 shots per 2 AA's.  Sony... think it was, maybe it was a Kodak.  DanC has/had something like it.  3MP and one of the older digi models.  Anyway, always liked that camera.  I now have my second Lumix.  This one is $349 at Futureshop Buck and so far is mint.  A must have now for me is the Lithium rechargeables that last waaaaaay longer than any AA's and charge quick.  I also need batteries that work in the cold and AA's are totally unreliable once the camera comes out of the pocket for any length of time.  My Lumix on many days I just leave wrapped in a towel in the fishing box when on the ice.  Leica lenses rule too IMO.  My older 4MP Lumix has never steered me wrong, so far I'm liking the model above as well.  Will be posting big reports soon with some pics from both Lumix cameras."

Canon S3) in its class is that the wide angle is not as wide as I'd like.  With the Panasonic (I am sure the manufacturers as well), they offer an add-on wide-angle lens for a premium."
115110,mooseroo,2007-09-18 19:50:00,80,"Anything in the Canon Powershot SD line would be my suggestion. They are small enough that you can fit them in a breast pocket (fishing vest) or slip into a small compartment in your tackle box. They take great picks, have great battery life, and are at a nice price point.<br><br>  Here are some samples from a recent houseboat trip in the Kawarthas.

115133,lazybum,2007-09-18 21:19:00,142,I have a Pentax Optio 50 with 5 mega pixels and I don't like it.  It's a battery eater and very poor in low light conditions.  My old Canon 2 mp A40 is still better than this newer Pentax.  I would buy a low price Canon again.  I also have a Nikon D40 for $1k plus that is bigger and too pricey for playing around the water and Carp slime.

118586,JohnF,2007-09-28 17:55:00,3494," I'm looking too. I have several cameras now but I want something compact enough to carry when fishing, economical to buy and operate, and with decent lens components and reasonable optical zoom, resolution & processing speed.  I'm a Canon fan because of the lenses they use in the slightly higher end cams (dunno if they use 'em in the little bitty models as well), but my family members have convinced me that Fuji and Panasonic are doing good things too, although the Panasonic fan has admitted that he'd go Fuji if he got to do a rerun.  For this camera my non-negotiable terms are AA batteries and SD card (great deals available these days and most new laptops have readers built in) and a price of less than $200  Water resistant would be a plus, or the option of a reasonably priced case (not likely) but for the price I'll pay I'm willing to take my chances with dunking it. The same features will be available a year from now for less than $100.  JF"
118591,irishfield,2007-09-28 18:35:00,26272, I had that attitude in the spring too....buy the waterproof case ! LOL

118610,bpsbassman,2007-09-28 19:35:00,941,"I have a Canon IS3 and it is fantastic.  About six friends and family have the same camera and all are extremely happy. Its a little over the $200 mark, but well worth it, but I know how hard it is for you to part with your $$$"
118614,poobah,2007-09-28 19:41:00,39,"I have an Olympus Stylus 770SW It's 7.1 meg, has image stabilizer, waterproof to 33 feet, crushproof up to 220lbs, and freeze proof to -10 C. I've had it since, March, and I have no complaints.  http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetai...4717&catid="
118626,JohnF,2007-09-28 20:01:00,3494," I'm probably the saddest guy you've ever seen whenever I break (or drown) one of my toys, but hey, it's a great excuse to buy a new one. You're talking to a guy who took up fishing last summer, has caught nothing but little bitty river Bass and short skinny Pike (and a few weeny critters that don't qualify as real gamefish) and I already have 14 reels hanging on my den wall, and at least one rod for each of 'em. On the floor there are two largish tackle boxes (full), so don't get to thinking I'm inclined to be fearful of acquiring new toys. If you asked my wife you'd see something like this -  Actually, now that I think about it, I have several more rods and reels loaned out that I forgot about. I even have a big ole trolling rod and monster level winder reel hanging there and I haven't been near a boat for anything but diving in the last 6 or 8 years. I really should find a better home for it so it can get some fresh air and exercise and not just whither away here in my landlocked basement. Someday I may get a boat and then I can get it back and put it to use myself. Any volunteers? Perhaps it will cadge some invites for me on it's residence vessel.  I'm familiar with drowning camera gear from my diving. Mebbe I'm more cautious than most because of that. I keep a neck lanyard on my cameras when I'm fishing now and just tuck the camera into the bib pocket inside my waders. That's why I want a slimmer cam. The ones I have are kinda bulky for carrying there.  JF"
