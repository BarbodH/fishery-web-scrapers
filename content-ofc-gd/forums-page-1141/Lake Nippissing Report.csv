We rented at 21' pontoon and we were 6 friends. The first day it was pretty windy, and in 8 hours on the water we only caught 1 pike, 1 bullhead, and 1 small perch. Day 2 was a little bit better, we hooked 5 pike and 1 bullhead in 11 hours. The last day, we managed to catch 2 pike in around 6 hours of fishing. The biggest pike of them all was 4 pounds.  This is probably the least amount of fish we have ever caught in that amount of time. We tried every type of lure, and every part of the lake. I don't think we'll be going back there next time."

118861,myst,2007-09-29 15:27:00,57,We stayed at Deluxe Camp which I believe is in the West Arm. Is that the bad part of the lake?

Muskies were had there last week.. I hope that it did,nt deter you from trying again next year... you were so close.."
