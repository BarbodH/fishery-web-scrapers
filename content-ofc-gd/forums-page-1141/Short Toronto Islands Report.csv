I headed straight to the spots that have been producing big bass so far this fall.  Because I was fishing after a cold front with cool conditions I wasn't very confident so started with live bait.  I float fished worm in all the usual weeds/docks but caught nothing.    So I changed tactics and started casting xraps for pike - no hits or follows - well other than baby bass that seemed to like to chase lures that are almost bigger than them!    I then turned my attention to salmon - as I had seen a number of fish jump that I presumed were salmon.  Cast my little cleos for an hour or so but nothing!    So I continued walking along the shoreline and spotted a few carp, so tried to catch one.  On about three occasions I could see a carp around the bait but each time they got spooked.  It was obviously not going to be my day, but I didn't give up as I wanted to avoid the dreaded skunk.  So I continued fishing with small bits of worm as bait under a float.  In the end I managed to catch a few sunfish, small bass and perch.  Not quite the day off I had hoped for but I guess it was better than being in the office.  The highlight of the day was watching an incredible fiery sky unfold over the City Skyline as I waited for the ferry back.  Maybe if I get time tomorrow I'll post some of those pics.  Hopefully I'll have better luck next time.  007"
118401,007,2007-09-28 02:34:00,537,Just downloaded my photos from today and will try to add some incredible shots of the evening sky tomorrow.  However there was one I just had to post now.  It sums up my day!    When I set up the camera for self-timer shots (in case I caught a decent fish) I took a test shot holding an imaginery fish but didn't delete it.  Sure summed up the day!!! No big fish in my hands or this report!  Cheers 007
118407,sharper,2007-09-28 02:53:00,279,"Haha funny pic! I always see the fishes around the island but can't always catch them. Well like they say ""a bad day fishing is still better then a good day at work."" How is the crowd like on the island during the weekdays?"
118411,fatherof3,2007-09-28 03:05:00,1769,"nice pic lol, we all have days like that"
118447,dsn,2007-09-28 06:34:00,1018,Yeah the carp in that area are really smart and spooky. Thanks for the update on the fishing.   dsn
118475,ccmtcanada,2007-09-28 11:53:00,7971,Great report 007!  You summed it up well...better than a day in the office.  Love the shot of you and your imaginary fish...LOL.  I get skunked quite a bit....even when there isn't a cold front...but you gotta get out and try.  Your next PB could be your next cast!!
118487,007,2007-09-28 12:35:00,537,"Sharper.  At this time of year the Islands on a weekday are pretty deserted, which is one of the reasons I wanted to take some time off work and fish there.  I'm not one for fishing with crowds and at weekends that can happen.  Although now we are almost in October it shouldn't be that busy at weekends either and the boats will start to decrease too.  I should have picked a better day to go.  dsn - the carp are still there but more spread out and very spooky (I need to improve my stalking tactics).  All day I saw about 5 carp close-in ranging from about 8lbs to 25lbs!  CCMTCanada - You're right about the next cast.  I was pretty fed up by early-afternoon but I just couldn't leave early as you never know when your luck will change!  Hopefully I can get a couple of good days in in October.  007"
118493,Golfisher,2007-09-28 12:57:00,586,What a fish!
118494,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-28 13:07:00,698,  007 I found out myself that the islands can be frustrating but also very rewarding  I think night time would be better to catch the carp because they would be less spooked...But don't miss the last ferry!
118530,ccmtcanada,2007-09-28 15:13:00,7971," Or DO miss the last ferry....and just ""happen"" to have enough bait for the whole night, food, water, sleeping bag and a pillow with you....LOL"
118538,tbayboy,2007-09-28 15:38:00,1497,"Thats a great pic, glad you didn't delete it.  Heck a bit of time with photoshop and you'll never get skunked again"
118539,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-28 15:44:00,1183,"Great looking fish - I imagine one in each hand.  You and Bowshep have a lot in common, seems the fish disappear when the flash goes off.  You two should get together...on second thought better not."
