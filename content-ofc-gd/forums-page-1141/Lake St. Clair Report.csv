118065,Wendel,2007-09-27 04:35:00,213,"A little late, but thought I would post some pictures of our recent trip to my old pond, Lake St. Clair. We got on the water by noon, we were targeting small mouth bass, unfortunately the bass were few and far between. We left the shallower water and headed for a deeper part of the lake, that's when the fun started! We could see some big hooks on the fish finder, no sooner did I say ""I think those might be musky down there"", then I had something heavy on the end of my line, unfortunately for me it was only for a few seconds. No sooner was it off of my line then it decided to hit Nicole's line! After a minute or so with a some help from me the fish was in the boat, briefly for a photoshoot. Here are the results... The pre-landing shot    Of course I could tell everyone I caught it, because there was no way she would pick up that fish for picture...    The Revival    And the fish swimming off to fight another day!    This was Nicole's first time on the lake, and her first musky.... many more to come in the fall... better get more lures though nicole, worm harnesses aren't going to cut it all the time lol"

Hope she doesn't read this lol  Actually I'm kinda glad she got one the first trip, she can't wait to go again, and she's already been asking what kind of rod/reel combo she needs lol The water was so clear that day, it got a little rough in the afternoon, but over all it was a great day, we are going back in a couple more weeks... The fall fatties should be gorging by then..."
