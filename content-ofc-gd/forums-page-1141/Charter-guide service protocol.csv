They're charging us a flat rate /day / person for boat, fuel and bait.   He's got a  20 ft boat so it should be able to take a fair amount of weather. The boat owner/guide is a friend of a friend.  My question is,  what is standard protocol relative to payment when the weather gets bad enough where it's not safe &/or comfortable to go out.   Are we still obligated to pay him something for his time ?  I've never experienced this sort of thing before and I,d be curious to know what the proper thing to do is ?  Thx."

I's not yours or the Captains fault that the inclimate weather is bad. Down here the Captain makes the call, and a good Captain won't take you out on a rough day."

117335,Whopper,2007-09-25 15:47:00,2174,It's the captains call and if you don't fish no pay.

118712,irishfield,2007-09-28 23:33:00,26272,Hopefully you get out....   as it will be cheaper than watching the peelers at Fannies if you don't!
118726,rob v,2007-09-29 00:32:00,535,Irishfield - you're absolutely correct on that point !!
118728,aniceguy,2007-09-29 00:39:00,1094, LOL fine northern entertainment just a skip off the highway  that was funny
