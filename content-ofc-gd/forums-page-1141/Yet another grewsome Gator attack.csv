116269,Muskieman,2007-09-21 20:47:00,2472,Check this out!!!  I think it's pretty cool...now should that pike be tracked down ?   
116272,fatherof3,2007-09-21 21:02:00,1769,that was wild
116276,evster,2007-09-21 21:26:00,367,I think i'd have one pair of pants that would need to be changed thats for sure!
116282,Greencoachdog,2007-09-21 21:38:00,8163,"I don't think he was familiar with handling Pike or how ill tempered they can be. I'll bet that bite leaves a mark that won't soon go away, just think of all the little teeth that broke off in there and the infection that probably set in!"
116286,wuchikubo,2007-09-21 22:05:00,1114,That should remind him why not to use live bait when hand fishing! LOL  That's going to leave a mark.
116294,ecxstriper,2007-09-21 22:39:00,343," GCD you might want to see your eye doctor soonÂ ,lol . The pike that bite him was going after the fish he was releasing. I know you are getting old but you aren't that old yet or are you."
116301,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-21 23:15:00,2585,lol that was awesome.  i can see the pike down in the weeds telling all his pike buddies how he bit back lol  CHeers!
116315,Daplumma,2007-09-22 00:38:00,1961,Looked to me like he was noodling for pike or sharks ar whatever.Them overgrown minnows are nothin but bait for real fish!
116399,glen,2007-09-22 15:17:00,2641,Do you know where i can buy a bait with hand attached to it.  I hear pike love them.

I called my buddy Bud who owns the place where It happend , he confirmed that it's true, It was his nephew and little cousin 12 & 14."
