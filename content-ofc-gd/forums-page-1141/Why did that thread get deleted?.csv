118634,jedimaster,2007-09-28 20:08:00,3472,I am very dissapointed that that thread got deleted. Even with that last barage of posts it had some extremely intering viewpoints and comments. Overall I think there is a very mature crowd here. I applaud those that shared there feelings on that topic.

118653,steve_paul,2007-09-28 21:00:00,658,It was an OFC Gene Pool Cleansing.  Sadly the human race gene pool is not so easy to cleanse.
118655,jedimaster,2007-09-28 21:06:00,3472,The gene pool got a little thin at the end... I wonder what the very last post was.

118657,wuchikubo,2007-09-28 21:10:00,1114,It was a jaw dropping remark that wasn't going to sit well with a lot of people (my opinion only).
118663,ecmilley,2007-09-28 21:23:00,2163,didn't realize ther was a thread that was getting nasty and i was on OFC all afternoon
118668,wuchikubo,2007-09-28 21:42:00,1114," BTW steve_paul, I was trying to quote your response in the deleted post as ""ditto""."
118669,Terry,2007-09-28 21:47:00,14456,"yeah, it had to go"

118738,Greencoachdog,2007-09-29 01:12:00,8163,Well if y'all would ACT civilized (even if it is just an act) things like this wouldn't happen!!!

118798,ccmtcanada,2007-09-29 04:48:00,7971, Wasn't you!!!  There was a post from this afternoon that got a lot of ppls heads shaking. No need for an apology Randy.
118826,jedimaster,2007-09-29 12:26:00,3472,"When I first read the post that got the snow ball rolling I was flabergasted. I thought at first it was a joke. Its good to see that so many were offended so quickly by it and I don't hold anything against anyone for pulling the the thread, but I would have think an edit and lock would have been appropriate as well. Overall it really serves to show how many fishermen on this board have great attitudes."
118833,bigfish1965,2007-09-29 13:23:00,3382,"Editting isn't always the best or sometimes easiest option. Often, someone says something stupid, then there are replies with quotes and replies tot hat and it just becomes too much so deletion is the best situation. It is still possible for one of us to clean it up and replace it All deleted threads  go to a hidden folder that admins have access to."
