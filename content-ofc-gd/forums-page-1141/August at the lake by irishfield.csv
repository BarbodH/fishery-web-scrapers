118745,Carp,2007-09-29 01:50:00,1488,Great pics Wayne.  Nice work on the cottage.
118751,Joey,2007-09-29 02:12:00,9122,"Another super report Wayne.  Really great pictures.  I just love the one of you mother tubing.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, that one is worth a million  Joey"
118428,irishfield,2007-09-28 03:57:00,26272,"Thought I’d break the summer down into Months and post what we’ve been up to up North. We had a great summer, with Leah only taking ill a couple times during the rainy/cold times in July and earlier in September.  I succeeded in doing some firsts, both on the fishing front and renovation fronts. Taught my two young nephews (Leah’s sisters kids) how to cast successfully and safely. One even caught a “BIG” rock bass from around the dock. Fished with my 81 year old mother and my 50+ year old sister for the FIRST time in my life. Targeted Lake Trout all season and got pretty good at figuring out where they go when it’s calm and when the wind blows. Had numerous guests up this season and not one went home without putting a Laker in the boat…or four for that matter. I learned how to split rock to any thickness I desired and hell I even managed to make it stay on a wall. May not be to Bricknblock standards…but I’m happy with my creation. Thanks to a good friend/customer (another reason why you should treat customers like they’re a king), who picked me up at the end of my dock and flew me into the back country one day,  I finally got a comfortable enough feeling to explore the back country solo and over the last couple weeks did some exploring and fishing on the back lakes of Temagami.  Here’s the month of August  Funny how there’s work to do each month before I can go fishing. New laminate floor going down…green carpet gone!     Got that all done just before this wonderful couple dropped by the dock. Dano and Fern off for a week of houseboating on Temagami   Iguess all women are the same when it comes to pictures!   ..and off they go to have fun!   Here’s my customer, that has become a close friend, dropping in to pick me up and take me on a tour of the back country of Temagami       Was really happy our son made it up this summer. Leah was happy to have him around for a few days as you can see in her face..   The view from Caribou Mountain if you’ve never been up there…you should go.   Can you tell he’s mine?   About says it all !   Son tugging on a Laker up around Racoon Point in the North Arm    The Eric Lindros hold on another one..   Shot I thought was neat off the engine cowling   Dang…more work..     Ready to play   Maple Mountain fire tower…looking South   Took Leah into Florence Lake for some exploring and a swim     My buddy Tom came up and I put him on 4 lakers in a couple of hours. This was his best at 27 inches and fat.   His wife Sheila helping me flip the grill over and can’t wait to try Lake Trout for the first time.   And my Daughter with the biggest of the season..32 inches long    Got my 81 year old mother and older sister out fishing. Have never fished with either of them in my life! Why do we leave this stuff so late in life?   Sisters big Laker…better than a boat skunk!   And the highlight of my summer! My 81 year old mother, quad bypass at 66, three aortic anurisms beyond operating size out tubing ! "
118429,bpsbassman,2007-09-28 04:11:00,941,Great report Wayne.  There are some awesome experiences there to remember for a lifetime. Your son is the spittin' image of you.  Does he talk as much too??
118430,Mike the Pike,2007-09-28 04:12:00,3421,I love it your Mom tubing at 81 now thats what you call staying youthful.A bonus you got your son out fishing how did you convince him.He must like the new boat.Looks like the summer was half work and half play.  MTP
118436,kennyman,2007-09-28 04:40:00,737,"That is awesome (mom tubing LOL). I had an elderly gentlemen come in the store a couple years ago looking for parts for a 427 big block chevy (it was NASTY too... easy 500hp!). Curious, I asked him what he had this in and he said a flat bottom boat, then proceeded to go grab some pics out of his truck of him standing this thing right up. I was shocked. I asked him how fast he had it and he replied 104mph. I grinned from ear to ear and asked if I could shake his hand. Boy, I hope I'm like that when I'm in my eighties."
118438,irishfield,2007-09-28 04:44:00,26272, NO he's really quiet...like I use to be !
118443,OhioFisherman,2007-09-28 05:26:00,6623,"More great pictures, looks like a great summer. Jugs in the water, rocks or mooring point for the plane?"
118450,Terry,2007-09-28 09:26:00,14456,"81 and tubing..wow  nice pictures, are they from the camera that went in the drink"
118453,misfish,2007-09-28 09:44:00,29133,"Great report Wayne,nice job on the floor.  81 eh,ok Terry,your turn,will use my boat.LOL"
118457,mcallister.grant,2007-09-28 10:23:00,327,Great report. Looks like you are a getting a lot of things done that you dodn't get a chance to do earlier on on life. Way to go!!
118470,ccmtcanada,2007-09-28 11:42:00,7971,Before the shot of you and your son side by side the first thought was wow....spitting image of Wayne!!  Love the pictures....is your daughter puckering up to give that fish a kiss??? LOL.  Great shots of your mom too...she seems like quite the lady!!!
118478,Whopper,2007-09-28 12:01:00,2174,"Damit Wayne I was all set to come to work this morning and get some real work done, go figure  Love Leah's tee shirt, tell her that none of us are normal lol.  LOL Roger that's funny.  Catching up is better than regret  Thanks  Whopper"
118480,Crazyhook,2007-09-28 12:07:00,1154,Awesome report!!! need any company up there!
118484,John,2007-09-28 12:26:00,2956,Great report Wayne. I am too aware of the fact that we leave the best things too late in life having lost both parents quite recently. Do more of it and lots of it......  J...

118491,BrianV,2007-09-28 12:54:00,35,What does you 'walking-Mac-ad' of a son study?
118498,LeXXington,2007-09-28 13:28:00,1928,Excellent report Wayne.  Glad too see you had an excellent summer.  Love the pics
118503,irishfield,2007-09-28 13:33:00,26272, He's done..just figures he should get my 80 grand worth out of the shirt! Computer/Electrical Engineering.
118505,irishfield,2007-09-28 13:37:00,26272," Yes Terry Canon A570IS  I hope I'm still moving at 81, but hope I'm not the ticking time bomb my mother is afraid that her next step's her last."
118508,irishfield,2007-09-28 13:43:00,26272,"Thanks for the comments so far guys! Even got some PM's from a couple of the younger guys thanking me for the inspiration to work hard but enjoy life, and those mean a lot to me.  I bugger off the whole summer now to keep Leah in cleaner air and keep her out of the hospital, but the penalty for me will be 6 or 7 months of 12 to 16 hour days in the shop all fall/winter...as long as I stay of OFC (said that last year didn't I!)"
118547,misfish,2007-09-28 16:21:00,29133,"Wayne I believe fall started a couple days ago,what are you waiting for,get to work.LOL"
118575,Moosebunk,2007-09-28 17:28:00,3970,Super report Wayne.  Awesome laker fishing and an 81 year old tubing is one heckuva feat.
