Really looking forward to it as I've never been fall walleye fishing or to Stony before(heard it's awesome).We reserved the bassboat at the resort. Anyone been up there before? How's the resort and cottages? Is the fishing good at that area of the lake?"

We nailed bass all day and even hit a surprise musky while bass fishing. The lake is full of ski's and bass, and walleye too if you know where to look. good luck!"
