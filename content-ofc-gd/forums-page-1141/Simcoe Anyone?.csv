118689,wuchikubo,2007-09-28 22:44:00,1114,"Would all of you stop, you're all killing me with all of these wicked offers to go fishing. I have to work Saturdays and this doesn't help.  Good fishing to those who can make it"
118690,ranger520vx,2007-09-28 22:48:00,164,15 minutes passed...no ringy on my phone. Must be all afraid of the speed?
118692,misfish,2007-09-28 22:54:00,29133,"LOL Stan. You who fish during the working week of the normal man, should not complain .L M A O  Mark. If I get out,it will be with the wife,who is not away for so many days.LOL  I,ll be hitting the milk run/running and gunning. She  likes the ride  and the perch fishing at the end makes up for my days away."
118694,SlowPoke,2007-09-28 22:58:00,2984,I'd be on that offer like a fat kid (me) on a smartie but I don't think I can get away all day and a half day wouldn't be worth a trip from London. I'd love a bass tutorial on Simcoe some day however! Bump for a good offer! -Brian
118695,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-28 23:01:00,0,Dang! I already have my regular partner for Saturday! Though I might be taking tuesday to friday off next week!!!
118697,ranger520vx,2007-09-28 23:04:00,164,Johnny Bass...it was a trick.. I wanted to fish your spots dude. You didn't take the bait!! i got some sick days coming with this weird strain of Eurasian Strepococucus I've caught from tans-atlantic ship ballast discharge in the Great Lakes.
118703,ranger520vx,2007-09-28 23:14:00,164,45 minutes..no calls. I feel like the last kid picked at dodgeball.
118704,irishfield,2007-09-28 23:16:00,26272,"Really makes ya wonder...don't it ! Everyone cries they never get out, don't have a boat..    and then when an offer they can't refuse is thrown in their face..they're no where to be found."
118707,bassman,2007-09-28 23:23:00,384,"That's a great deal people, I can't believe no one has taken you up on the offer. I'm with my fishing buddy tomorrow, but if you ever want to hook up during the week, please let me know."
118713,ranger520vx,2007-09-28 23:40:00,164,SOLD!! Took 68 minutes!!
118714,tbayboy,2007-09-28 23:44:00,1497,I'm not sure if I should be happy that I'm going fishing with Mark or sad that I'm at home on a Friday night hanging out on computer forums but I'll go with happy for now
118719,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-29 00:07:00,0," Huh???? What I meant was that if I didn't have to go with my regular partner on Saturday I would have come fishing with ya, and sure I would have shown you SOME of my spots.  But I may be taking tuesday to friday off and no I wont pay $60 to fish for anywhere less than 8 hours."
118810,motv8tr,2007-09-29 07:08:00,2587,"Have a great time guys, I'll be thinking of you while I'm at work   Don't forget the camera  Maureen"
