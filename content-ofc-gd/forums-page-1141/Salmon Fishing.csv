We met up at about 7am and were launched shortly after... after a while out there trolling we see one of the rods bounce and get released from the rigger... Fish On! and sure enough it was my first Salmon.  Not huge, but very fresh and healthy..., and great to have finially gotten one.   some more time passed and the same thing happens, and the rod is released, Yet another FISH ON... this was to be my first bow this fall and after a couple nice leaps in the air we got it boated for a quick pic, and then back into the drink it went... this one had a lamprey on the side as you can tell from the mark in the flesh.    It was a great day on the water, not a cloud to be seen and comfortable water conditions, and air temperatures all morning long. Again thanks Percher for gettin' me on those fish and my first salmon."
