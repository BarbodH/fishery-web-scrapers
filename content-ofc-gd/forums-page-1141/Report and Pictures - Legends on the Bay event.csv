117903,Shaun Rickard,2007-09-26 21:01:00,144,"What a great weekend with some truly great, fun loving and down to earth people, including our Pro Anglers and the NHL Alumni guys, all of whom turned out to support a great cause on their own time - For more information on the Legends on the Bay event in support of SickKids Foundation go to: http://www.legendsonthebay.com  Despite some very nasty looking weather and high winds on Saturday morning the tournament side of the event went off without a hitch, even after consideration of canceling the tournament by the Directors when a small craft advisory was announced. My hat is off to Andy Pallotta of the CSFL for managing the event flawlessly. Thankfully the winds settled and the skies cleared and after a 1-hour delay the blast off went ahead – Pictures below.  Our film crews and hosts had their work cut our fighting 30+ KM winds, not an easy task shooting boat to boat in those conditions. But like true professionals and with the co-operation of the 10 competing teams the shoot was a success. Keep an eye out for updates as to when the ‘Legends on the Bay HD Special’ will air on Rogers Sportsnet, we’ll keep you posted.  Despite the cold front and extremely challenging fishing conditions all ten teams weighed in their 3 fish limits, well almost, Tony Dean had the crowd howling with laughter when he attempted to sneak a pike through the scales, nice touch and a good try Tony – Pictures below.  Here are the final results – Congratulations to all! Everyone is a winner at an event like this.  Pro Angler and NHL Alumni 1. Paul Castellano and Mark LaForest --- 10.74 lbs 2. Danny Maw and Wendel Clarke --- 10.40 lbs 3. Craig Butler and Darryl Sittler --- 9.68 lbs 4. Jimmy Dodd and Bob Probert --- 8.34 lbs 5. Rob Laframboise and Mike Gartner – 8.10 lbs 6.
