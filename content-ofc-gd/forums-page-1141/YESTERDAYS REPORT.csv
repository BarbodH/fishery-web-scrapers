118274,fatherof3,2007-09-27 20:35:00,1769,well said Kemper
118275,GNODDY,2007-09-27 20:41:00,163,I think all of you have way to much time on your hands. Its almost like discussing politics there are to many views. I have one though I was just fishing on the Miramichi river on the weekend and similar to the chinook or coho these fish do not feed when running tribs. They do however hit whatever you are using roe and flys out of instinct and I vouched for Dave he's a great guy and great sportsmen.  Cheers and get over yourselves  Gnoddy
118284,Milty,2007-09-27 21:23:00,121,"  All Fish were released properly and took off with a splash,..so whats your point ?"
118363,bucktail,2007-09-28 01:18:00,1857,"Have to agree with Terry, sorry everyone doesnt live up to your moral highground. Dmasse has done nothing wrong and doesnt deserve to be publicly judged by you. Intolerance of other people and there beleifs is what leads to mans worst behaviour. As the the wiseman once said. ""Let him without sin cast the first stone""..... funny how it still rings true 2000 years later.......and I am not even religious."
118369,bowshep,2007-09-28 01:33:00,378,"First of all never yap about a person you don't know who he or she is. Dave took me their so l can catch fish. l have the worst luck when it comes to the bows. l have had my center pin for almost a year now and l still have the vice like grip on it   but l cant learn unless l fight them. l have to start somewhere, Right. l have seen Dave stop his fishing and help a newbie out with out hesitation. He has given more tackle away than most of you loose. He is not only helping me fish but he is helping me to be a gentlman on the water treating everyone with respect and honer. It is easyer to covert a snagger by showing them a different way. Milty showed me that first and Dave just continued it. l have seen no one in my life care for his pray so much as Dave, he has removed more hooks and pocketed more lost line (Ash polls Pick Up Your Line).  Now the sand box stuff:  Aniceguy we chated on the river l was teaching Chrome Hen how to cast with a center pin. We were on a east trib fishing with Dave and Paul (Owner of Raven)so ether 1. You were Slumming 2. You were lost 3. We were fishing in the right place (for your standards)  Look lm in all perposes a Newbie and l want to learn as much as l can Aniceguy and Highdrifter you have information that you have to get out so why not use Daves approch and teach the right way. You have valid points that are to be expressed but yas got to use more sugar when you do it. Peace Ken"
118390,DMASSE,2007-09-28 02:16:00,420,Kemper  Yes we did meet in the past and I believe it was on OSHAWA  YELLOW14 (FrANK) you got cheesed on  HA HA HA  DAve
118394,aniceguy,2007-09-28 02:19:00,1094,"Ken  craa is running a session to teach anglers on many of the points of river fishing come to the site and check the date Im sure you ll pick up some great pointers, never lost but slummin can sometimes lead to a wicked walk"
118395,Gerritt,2007-09-28 02:20:00,6129,"Here it comes...  once again... the purists show us that they are elite and the rest of us are the green algae that muddy the waters...  I cant wait to see the pictures of fish being held up by the CN Tower, or Loblaw's... tis the season for the elitist's amongst us .... BTW... this only happens during ""their"" season.... I tend to say things as they are.. some care for it some dont.. so here it is... scrap your holiest then thou bull and fish for the sake of fishing... that is all it is about... a tug on your line... not how pretty you look, not how much your centrepin is worth, and not how hot your ass looks in your 1500.00 pair of waders... it all comes back to basics... the tug on your line.  I am tired of seeing kiddies posing for pics while landing fish... I have also seen these so called purists clean fish on the banks stuff them into their 300.00 camo backpacks and head further upstream.. after posing for pics BTW...  I remember when I was young... I fished out of a piece of crap boat, had a cheap Johnson closed face reel and only God knows the name of the rod.... and you know what?? I wish I could fish like that again today... That was fishing when I was young... being out there with my dad and grandfather just to be out there... Not to host a fashion show!  Has technology advanced?.... Yes!  But to some onto forums bragging about how hot your ass looks in your waders  or your 900.00 centrepin is stupid in my opinion.. nothing but sheep... seriously...your nothing but sheep.  Have fun with your over glorified fashion show on the rivers and creeks...  I hope your making those 50'ish guys on the other side of the trib sweet on you... as they are the only ones your impressing with your hot ass in your hot waders...  I promise I will not make another post about the elitist's as I am tired of God like Bull... another year another elitist catching fish in the ACC  Gerritt."
118398,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-28 02:25:00,1183,"  Really, my ass looks hot in my hot waders...gee thanks.   lol I'm just fooling, couldn't resist - didn't think anyone noticed.  hahahaha"
118402,Milty,2007-09-28 02:37:00,121,"Shep,...$50 we get into chrome this weekend!!!!"
118404,DMASSE,2007-09-28 02:46:00,420,MILTY  I know Ken is due....  And the conditionsa re perfect fro sat...  Wish I could go..  But remember FRANK got cheesed on LOL on his first time out....  He will always remember that now for as long as he fishies for salmon  Dave
118406,Milty,2007-09-28 02:52:00,121," Gerritt,...Besides my Islander centrepin,..this is what my stuff costs when i go up river.....$100 floatrod, $100 waders,...$40 chest pack and maybe $150 of gear inside,....thats probably less than the gas on your boat for a few weeks..but I catch dozens and dozens of steelhead in a beautiful natural setting with noone around,...I'll go head to head on a stretch of river that I fish (which takes effort and knowledge to find..hence the lack of pressure)..with any guy in a  $3000 get-up... any old day of the week!!  For everything else there is mastercard!!!  ,...Quality is quality same as boats,..but it doesnt make the ANGLER!!!!"
118408,Milty,2007-09-28 02:57:00,121,"  Dave,..Too bad your workin,..maybe sunday or next week,..i got some spots to show you,.....'Frank got cheesed',..whats that mean,...?  these are real guide waters as u know..,..i share with you,..but after that it costs for others,..and that price is toooo high fora anyone...lol,......  ..you know how it goes..."
118409,bowshep,2007-09-28 03:00:00,378,afissin l will go  afissin l will go   high hold the rainbow   a fissin l will go Peace Ken  and Milty the CP is the cheapest thing you have lol
118418,kemper,2007-09-28 03:19:00,2232,"So I was right, see you out on the river DMASSE. Probably when its far too cold for any so called 'sane' people to be fishing, but no matter, more steel for us!"
118422,Roy,2007-09-28 03:36:00,13728,Glad you all have an opinion. Good stuff. I have something I want to say about all of this but it's getting late and I fear I may offend a few so I'll wait till morning. People come here  to read what's happening fishing in Ontario and for other information as well. They don't want to hear about someone's petty antics up a trib. You have a problem with an individual on the board...take the high road and PM/email the person.  That's all I have to say about that for now.  Sleep well everyone.
118424,Milty,2007-09-28 03:43:00,121,"  Actually shep its the most expensive,..by far,...thanks for buyin it ,..im sure its the least u could do,..after me getting you hooked for life!!!...lolol  Still not sure why u keep wanting to go east over north,..even though what you've seen me do and where..which is nothing compared to previous years....,...dont worry i got a tripod...LOL!!!..but you are the shep of sheps!!!...  see no M,...lol"
118221,highdrifter,2007-09-27 17:48:00,2534,"  I'd invite all consciencious and ethical anglers to put their 2 cents in here.  I fish because it's my in blood, and I grew up around the outdoors.  However, I was also taught respect.  You wanna get down to the nitty gritty of laws and ethics, COs and P3TA members would agree on the same thing.  There's a time and a place for everything.  This report's got neither. PERIOD."
118229,Headhunter,2007-09-27 18:15:00,5703,"Interesting response given the pic in your avatar... certainly doesn't look like that Steelie (Non native fish) was caught 15 miles out on Lake O or Huron... What exactly is it that makes it ok to fish Trout in streams and not Salmon? I'm sure that trout, a beauty by the way, was just minding it's own business, lookin for a female to do it's business with and the next thing it knows, it's ""feelings"" are being ruffled! I guess I just don't get it! HH"
118232,highdrifter,2007-09-27 18:23:00,2534,"Is there an echo in here??  Look at my folder and avatar, then look over to the shots taken on the thread.  Don't tell me you can't see the difference.  Bows will strike legit while they're upriver.  That shot was taken in November, and the fish was released with nothing more than a sore jaw.  Released, to do whatever it wanted.  Some people don't get it, I call those people SIMPLE."
118239,blaque,2007-09-27 18:45:00,2419,"Like shooting fish in a Barrell    Sorry, my poor attempt at lightening the mood here. Go easy guys"
118240,Headhunter,2007-09-27 18:46:00,5703,"Being the simple minded fool that I am, the only difference I see in catchin a trout in November, vs catchin a Salmon in September is that you will have most of the river/stream for your self! Otherwise, these a fish that are trying to do mother natures work, just a different times of the year! I find it interesting that the trout guys say salmon don't bite when they are in rivers or streams, yet I see reports daily, that people are catching them... legally! A trout is a fish and it has no more value than a rock bass or a musky for that matter. It's just a fish! I guess that if I wasn't so simple, I'd give up on this! LOL HH"
118242,Terry,2007-09-27 18:51:00,14456,the law states they can fish the river this time of year...so they are within the law...so you personal beliefs  don't mean anything and really shouldn't be posted in someone elses thread..starting your own thread..fine jumping in to a thread asking for your opinion..... go for it...but there is no place here  for people bashing people fishing within the law   IMHO......  hate the law not the fisherman
118267,kemper,2007-09-27 20:18:00,2232,"So now we even attack people who post reports that are perfectly within the law?  Ya, theres lots of people snaggin salmon this time of year, but to me it looks like DMASSE is NOT one of them. I believe I met DMASSE one day on the Oshawa in the middle of the winter fishing for steel and if he is who I think he is, its a great guy and one who really knows his stuff.  Read the report and lay off if you dont like it, and if you dont like reading reports about september salmon THEN DONT READ THEM  Thanks for the report DMASSE"
