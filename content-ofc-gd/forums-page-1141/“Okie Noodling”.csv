118388,vance,2007-09-28 02:02:00,719,I guess you guys missed the video of the well endowed women doing the same thing and I don't think they where wearing gloves ether.And NO they were not  -a la apluma(neked).  vance
118439,Musky or Specks,2007-09-28 04:45:00,2710,They are absolutely crazy. I saw them doing this on In Fisherman years ago. Then one spring while doing musky sampling in the spring up at Moon River Basin in Georgian Bay we got a huge channel cat in the fyke net and couldn't get it out of the trap. Being a smart ass know it all I mentioned the technique and proceded to demonstrate. Catfish only have vomerine teeth but when 23 pounds of thrashing mad catfish clamps down and doesnt let go it freaking makes a mess of your hand in a hurry(think two piece of 80 grit sandpaper clamped down and thrahed around on your hand) My knuckles looked like hamburger after it was over. Lesson: Dont be a smart azz-dumbazz!!!!

118521,Zib,2007-09-28 14:19:00,369," I've seen guys catch them without the wussy gloves. Mike Rowe of Discovery channels ""Dirty Jobs"" did that without using gloves."
