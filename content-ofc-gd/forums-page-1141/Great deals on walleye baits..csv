As a result of our Canadian currency getting stronger we felt that we would pass the savings on to our customers. All of our hard baits Rapala, Bomber, Arbogast, Cotton Cordell, Heddon, Rebel, Storm, Renosky and more have been reduced by a minimum of 10% and others have been reduced up to 30%. These price reductions will be in effect until the end of December and then turn our efforts over to the ice fishing season.  Effective immediately we have the following great prices on the following walleye lures.  All Manns Stretch 20+ baits including Dr. Death and Blueberry Muffin on for 7.49  All Reef Runner lures Ripstick and Deep Divers on for 6.99  Ripstick 700 series and Deep Divers 800 series  All Yo-Zuri deep diving lures on for 7.99  R539	Deep Divers and R540 Deep Divers  We will have our minnows in stock in approximately 2 weeks and our price will be 2.50 a dozen (taxes included) right through to the end of ice fishing season. I will not be putting our boat away until we have ice on the bay this year and I look forward to seeing everyone on the bay and we will be pleased to report on the progress of the fishing on the Bay of Quinte. During the ice fishing season we will be opening our store at 5:30 am for all of the out of town  ice fisherman arriving in the area.  When you come into the Bay of Quinte area drop in and visit and we will have the coffee on.  Best regards,  Sam and Laurie  "
