118215,ccmtcanada,2007-09-27 17:25:00,7971,"Try the mouth of any river or creek that runs into the lake.  Piers are popular locations.  If you head down to take a look and see lots of anglers then go and join them.   I'm not from that area, but this is where the fish head this time of year.  I'm assuming you meant shore spots?"

I don't think there is a run at the mouth of the little creek off the Kosa plnat (there used to be a good flow and good runs of fish)  People often are seen at Kingston Mills, near the power outlet, looking for stray salmon.  The water in the Napanee River is LOW and I wonder if they'll make it up to the falls.  Hope that helps  David  aka  Superdad Kingston / Hay Bay"
