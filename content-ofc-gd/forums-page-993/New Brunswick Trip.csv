230048,Stern Rules,2008-07-20 02:34:00,342,Went to New Brunswick for 2 weeks and we had NO rain while there and it was hot as hell so not a lot of brookie fishin' done. Creeks were low and the spots I did hit were crap except for the first one. Went to go out on the boat with the brother-in-law. Got the boat in the water but motor didn't start. So that day was shot. The flounder trip fell through. I was not impressed. Did get out for some perch and chain pickeral. Only got out a couple times but hammered the pickeral both times. Not really big ones but bigger than I usually get when I'm down. Tried some new lures and spinners I got from BPS and they worked great. Here's a few pics.
