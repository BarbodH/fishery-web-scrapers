230211,aplumma,2008-07-20 17:40:00,6896,now alls you need is a M16 to mount that thing to and your ready for the invasion. I actually have a tactical light that does not have the fancy glass breaker but the one I have is an LED that puts out 115 luminaries which is really bright. The bad side is the lithium batteries are 10 bucks a wack and are good for about an hours use. Not for everyday use but it is a nice bright light when you need it and it has a 10 year shelf light. I I think it might be the boat light everyone is looking for.  Art
