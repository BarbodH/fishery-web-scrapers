230265,ccmtcanada,2008-07-20 20:04:00,7971,WOW!!! IS THAT REAL??? COOL!!!
230266,forrest,2008-07-20 20:04:00,1032,That pic is a summer rerun.....2 pike+ 1 string leader + 1 person who forgets to bring fish in boat before heading to dock = that pic
230268,Meegs,2008-07-20 20:06:00,249,"from the same fourm,    quote ""That picture is real. Although it looks like a siamese pike it isn't. This picture is very old by internet standards.  These are two different fish. The pike on the left side was caught first and looped on the stringer. The pike on the right was caught second and placed on the rope by sliding the metal end up through the gill plate and through the mouth. When this pike slid down the rope the pike head on the left slid right into the other pike's gill plate making it look like a siamese pike.  The dead give away? Why is there only one end of the rope coming out of the mouth? Because the other pike is looped on the stringer preventing the other pike from coming off of the stringer. Also look at the pike's eye (weird looking) and follow the gill flap. It's hard to do but concentrate on the left gill flap and you will see it flare out to accomodate the other pike's head.""    saves me from explaning it!"
