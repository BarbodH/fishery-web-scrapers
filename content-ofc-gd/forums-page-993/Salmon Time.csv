Best thing about this week is that I was able to get 4 people into their first salmon.  My wife, my student, a coworker and his brother who was visiting from Albania.  What a blast seeing people feel the power of a King for the first time.  Here are some pics.                              I even managed a few...       Good times..  Sherriff"
