They said to cover up open wounds, but then they mentioned the digestive problems, bladder and prostate infections etc.  Is everyone swimming without any problems?"
229780,forrest,2008-07-19 02:36:00,1032, Dang....well if the province is saying to cover up open wounds that would be enough to stop me swimming.  I know that totally sucks but if there are a large amount or rotting bodies around then why chance it?  Find something else to do or place to go in the short term.  It will be over soon enough.  forrest PS....if a bunch of people are doing something risky does that mean its safe for you to do?
229794,LouChris,2008-07-19 03:16:00,3,"Well, we swam in Pigeon Lake during the die off last year without any ill effects.  I figured we've built up the same immunity as the locals so I would see what they are doing.  It's not like we can change our plans, we are locked in for the week as I'm sure many visitors are."
229826,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-19 11:17:00,1362,I'd be more worried bout the younger ones than the adults....they are the ones that seem to always get a scrape or cut here and there  ....they also tend to inhale more water then us when playin in the Lake...

I remember a few whoppers when my brother and I were younger, but none after we got into our teens.  I'm hoping for the best, we have really been looking forward to visiting Rice Lake.  I saw it once as a kid when my parents took us to the Serpent Mounds and it looked pretty impressive like it might have a big fish or two in it!"
