Thanks"

228764,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-17 03:23:00,4399,Nobodys been to Limerick lake lodge? nothing to say about Limerick lake?  I guess my son and I will just wing it.  Thanks to Beans and Solo for managing a response.

229117,snag,2008-07-17 21:43:00,1932," Limerick you say?  Here you go:  The bass is a mighty fine fish— As a dish, it is really delish— Or a musical sound That's the lowest around, Or the tastiest ale you could wish!   Sorry, never been there."

229142,cpguy29,2008-07-17 22:30:00,148,I've heard its really good up there. I think the boys at FishnCanada did a fall show up there. Might be on there website. However like most of the lakes up there just throw spinnerbaits or senkos towards any shoreline.
229913,woodro,2008-07-19 16:29:00,168,"Limerick is a decent operation. He has a few cabins which I have never stayed in but the main lodge is clean. The owner is a retired Yankee and has done a good job turning the marina around for all the cottagers who use it for lake access.  Stick baits, flippin jigs, and plastics in cover will work. Be patient and you eventually find some fish. The only ""problem"" that I found with the lake is that there is so much cover. You just need to pick through the small ones to get the big guys to hit.  Good luck"
