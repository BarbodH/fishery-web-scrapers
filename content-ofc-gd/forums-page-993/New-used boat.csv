My question,s are, for the ones that bought brand new and one,s that have bought used with remaining warranty. How many of you have had to use any part of your new full warranty?Type of boat and motor. Motor size would help also. How many have bought with remaining and was there a way to buy extended?  I got an eye on a couple that have remaining,and will be looking to see if theres extending or not.  Thought I would just ask here to see whats what.All boats have mercs except one,the other is a yammy. HP ranges from 90 to 175. All used boats are with,n 5 years old.  Thanks  Brian"

A talk with the owner then a run on the lake should do it. I've never had to use a warranty so I guess I'm not the guy to ask. I KNOW you'll do well me brudder....life owes ya. Good luck."

I am trying to sell my boat as we speak and asked about the warrenty.  My dealer said no worries just bring it in.  If it's a good company they are going to back their product, regardless.  I never buy into the extended warrenties, they are for the most part just another revenue source.  On of our dealers for bikes wants us to do this, but I refuse because I cannot justify charging a customer more for something that they do not need.   Did you get the PM I sent you?"
