229931,Leecher,2008-07-19 17:09:00,7832," Glad to hear that you can still go fishing even with a bad bruised finger   As for color, I noticed lately that chartreuse produce a lot of strike and that color is my favorite one  Good luck on Nipissing and report the results of your outing.  Leechman"

My buddies always slay the eyes up there with something called a Swedish Pimple tipped with a live minnow, but that is in January. They usually just try fishing with different colors until something works. Btw they are tendons not tenants LOL."
