229407,bushart,2008-07-18 12:49:00,2628,I fished it years ago with a little success---found it better up the other side of Paris for smallies if your mobile  Bushart
229408,davew3,2008-07-18 12:55:00,430,"Good day,  under the bridge is not shallow.  Good though.  Just down the is a small riffle.  Being carefull you can walk out there.  Ckeck each step so you don't step into a hole or crevice.  Also drop a minnow into some of the pockets. You nevr know what is hiding in there. Have fun"
229429,modny,2008-07-18 13:34:00,502,"yea  i'm new to wading, but i use a pole and wear a lifejacket just to be careful.  it looks like it could be a fun time out there..."
229447,bushart,2008-07-18 13:53:00,2628,Kinda have to caution you a bit------you don't want to fill those waders in strong current and hope that life jacket will keep everything good---liken those waders to 2 huge pails---hard to swim in---remember also in current that if you are inadvertently swept downstream to keep those feet as high as possible--cause if you lodge a foot under a limb or rock the current keeps pushing you down.  Don't want to deter you but couple things to keep in mind.  Bushart
229497,davew3,2008-07-18 15:51:00,430,"I agree.  Don't need waders with the water this warm.  Just wear high top good shoes and shorts.  If not a good swimmer and inflatible pdf would be a good investment. The pole is a good idea as well.  Take along a small silver mepps as well.  Cast down and bring back slow, just ticking the bottom. But keep your pole up to avoid snagging up Good luck."

229591,Rich,2008-07-18 20:05:00,3927,"Same as Caledonia for species. Bass, Walleye, Pike, Crappies, Carp and catfish all readily available if you're up for a day of wading.  I gotta say ditto on the wading stick though. There are a lotta deep spots that way, they come up on ya quick."
229636,modny,2008-07-18 21:40:00,502,"rich, do u likve out that way?  we should hit it up some time  i love a nice stringer full o strawberry bass"
229903,DANIMAL,2008-07-19 15:36:00,215,"I have only fished that spot once in mid summer, cought lots of smallmouth up to 1 pound and some cigar size walleyes."
230157,CLofchik,2008-07-20 14:25:00,854,"In the fall it can be a sleeper steelie spot if you catch them moving through. Summer, small bass & pike.  I used to throw a few casts around there passing through, biggest I ever saw was a 4lb. pike. There's also schools of mooneye around, a few guys flyfish for them.  Very scrappy & tasty bbq'd if you find the 12""ers."
