229883,limeyangler,2008-07-19 14:13:00,5204,Those do look awesome Danbo....but ya better use a wire leader at over $50 .

229899,Bassaholic,2008-07-19 15:29:00,74,These have roughly the same design as the HMNG popper and they're half the price. I have a couple and they're absolutely stunning. They're a functional piece of art.    http://www.tackletour.com/reviewmbpopmax.html
229917,Rich,2008-07-19 16:44:00,3927,"For the Japanese, creating lures is art more than it is to catch fish. I highly doubt those 60 dollar poppers would work any better than a Pop-R. Something to put in a display case more likely."
229920,GoneFishin,2008-07-19 16:50:00,349,"Wow I want one. but I would probably be to scarde of loosing it!! They are a bit pricie but I'm sure they are worth it, looks like a lot of work went into making them."
229979,forrest,2008-07-19 22:10:00,1032,"The lures seem to have a noise feature to them too; they take water in the mouth and exit via the ""gills"".  Untested and for $59 I'll leave it to the millionaires to test them."
