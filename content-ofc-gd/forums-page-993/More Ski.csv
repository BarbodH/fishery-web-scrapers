229785,pokerdemon4,2008-07-19 02:41:00,135,After working a long day yesterday I decided to do some musky fishing today.  On the water by 9:00am and the conditions were perfect all day.  I saw three fish and boated all three.  I had a great day.  The fishing gods smiled upon me.  Enjoy.

I'm yet to hook on a ski    Wish me luck for the next outing  Again great job boating these 3  Leechman"
229934,pokerdemon4,2008-07-19 17:16:00,135,Thanx for the response leechman.  It took 9 hrs of casting to convince these buggers.  Sometimes its very frustrating.  The two guys that went with me had one follow each but no hooked fish.  They never gave up though.  Thats what it takes.  I can't wait to do it again.  Too bad gas is so expensive.
229938,Leecher,2008-07-19 17:22:00,7832, Yeah gaz sure is expensive and the suspense is a killer but when someone finally hooks one.... reward is sweet  Can't wait to see your futur reports  Tight lines Leechman
