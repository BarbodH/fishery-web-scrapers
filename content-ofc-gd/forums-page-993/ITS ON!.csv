192459,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-25 21:58:00,3761,"Well i'm just glad he loves to fish. That makes two of us, he seemes like he is good at what he does but im tellin you he has some stiff competion and it will be a good battle."

193517,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-28 20:53:00,3761,Pfff
193875,Black_Blade,2008-04-29 17:29:00,258,"I'll have to put my bets of Mike...he is my son's best friend and came camping with us last year.  We got ourselves a little competition going at that time and I must say he amazed me with the fish he brought back to camp...just from some shore fishing!  Two of them were over three pounds, one over 4.  This was shore fishing at a provincial park, and you know how many people pound the shores at PP's!!  He actually did better from shore than in the boat...but he did say that he was not used to boat fishing.  LOL  I can imagine once he catches onto boat fishing techniques  He will be with us again this year, but at a different lake.  Not sure if this is the trip he is using for this little tourney here or not tho.  Excellent to see such enthusiasm, sure would have been neat to have the internet when I was a kid to have fun like this...good luck to both!!"
193923,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-29 19:47:00,3761,"Thanks for your comments  , and no im gonna have it when i go up to my grandma's for the second week of August. I would  do it with you guys but were goin for 2 weeks......i think so anyway."
194782,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-01 02:13:00,3761,"Well i got some very nice lures from Ryan, Co-owner of Hammer Head Lures. A huge thanks goes out to him and the other members giving away prizes.

230361,Mike the Pike,2008-07-20 23:06:00,3421,Ok its been along time I see Mike seems to be more active than the little Angler who unfortunately has a broken finger.

230362,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-20 23:11:00,3761,The thing is Little Angler does not get out at all that much. His only time to catch fish is during hid week long trip. Therefore we are only going to judge those fish caught in that time period.The same day he gets back i am heading out for a week to my grandmas fishing. I am only going to judge those fish.
