One is the intro hockey night in canada song (gives me chills) and 2 is coaches corner.  1 is gone and with grapes getting older both may be gone.  guess i will take up ice fishng if they both go one day.  Cheers!"
229740,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-19 01:29:00,2585,"ok this bothers me so much im going to comment again.  Not have the hockey night in canada theme song is like fishing in your driveway, its just not normal.  Cheers!"

Maybe some bored politicians will make this a discussion topic during parliament meetings and force TSN to give the song back.... they've done similar stupid thing calling in Hockey Canada about why getting Doan as captain.... this song thing is even more important!
