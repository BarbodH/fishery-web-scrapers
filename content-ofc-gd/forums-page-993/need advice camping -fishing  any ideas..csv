I just got back from 2 weeks at Restoule and I am hoping to find something similar but closer. I was thinking about Emily PP. Any feedback would be great. I am willing to travel about 3 hours from London so if any one could suggest a PP,private campground or even a conservation area in the same area or somewhere north past Barrie.Belleville area,or north of Peterborough  please post.  I will be bringing  the 16ft boat so good boating is a must and would like to fish walleye.pike/musky and bass.. Thanks for all replies. If you know of a good private campground(similar to Lakair Lodge) on a lake with some descent privacy on the sites in these areas please post."
