229685,oldphart,2008-07-18 23:07:00,665,"~~~Back on the 6th. Slug, Winston, and I decided to hit Sturgen for Bass, had a good drive up with lots of talk, as to where to launch, and where to start. Headed out this island, and sure enough Slugs has the first one, but I said I'm not going to be the camera boy on this trip, here's the cameras someone else take the pics, so Winston got Slugs phish as he released it  Winston wasn't to be out done Slug got this pic  Slug seem to have the hot bait while I slulked on the bow  action shots of another of his    Then it was Slugs turn on the camera  I tried to hide this one, but no one of the shutterbugs caught me  I actually had a good hit, and should have kept quiet, because Winston was fast on the cast, and stole him CAK CAK  So you know there was a lot of swearing, and some sugesting about his parentage, and if he wasn't in tight with a certain police officer, he might have gone missing with my anchour. O well there's always next weekend, he better be a light sleeper"
