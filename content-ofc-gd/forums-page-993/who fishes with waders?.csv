227027,super dave,2008-07-13 15:06:00,323,Another thing to consider when purchasing waders is to look into the warranty.  My first higher end waders were the Bare Blackwaters.  Very comfortable waders but they leaked every year.   Bare has a lifetime warranty so I would return them every year and get a brand new pair.  Some COs only have one year.  All waders will leak eventually so find a brand that will cover the repairs or replace. I've said it before in this thread and I'll say it again.  Look into purchasing from LL bean.  They have an amazing warranty policy. I also own simms g3 and I believe they have lifetime warranty as well.  Haven't had to send them back yet so I don't know what their customer service is like.
227049,limeyangler,2008-07-13 16:08:00,5204,"I bought my waders cuz the water levels on the Lake here was so low a couple of years back(before i moved up here permanently)i had to drag my uncles boat through the shallows before i could even begin to use oars /paddles to get to deepr water. I thought at the time it was a bit extravagent...even though they only cost me $39 from W-Mart. However i left them at my uncles when we returned to England, and they were waiting for me there when we eventually moved here. I am so gladi bought them....i take them in the truck when putting small 12' boats into hard to access lakes, i use them to get my boat out when i'm on my own, i use them when i'm doing work on the shoreline, i've been very glad to have them just recently when un-sinking my boat, they are excellent when i'm in our small foresty bit clearing downed trees as you dont get soaked, i have not used them to fish yet, but i'm sure the opportunity will arise one day .........BUY SOME!!!!!"
227079,Cookslav,2008-07-13 18:24:00,1457,"I got stern neoprenes, with a nice set of Hodgmans Wading boots...well worth every penny I seriously have not EVER been overly Hot in them even in the summer months, although mine are not Snug on me either, so they hang open enough to breath above the water line, and anything below the water line  generaly stays comfortably cool, be it 1 degree water or 70 degrees.  The nice thing about Neoprene is the versatility...you can use 'em all year round, and are more durable them other materials, and easily Patched I might add if you have an accident. All I'll say is this...  Good luck with a set of cheapies in November or May LOL...you'll freeze your you know what off"
229824,modny,2008-07-19 10:51:00,502,"i'm looking into a set with a lifetime warranty. buy it once, buy it for life.   simms G# sounds good. i'm not really a fan of the neoprene ones, the remind me of pajamas and i could imagein them being tight and restrictive/clunky"
226218,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-11 14:49:00,2050,"I'm hardly a wader pro - but the one thing I've learnt is to stay away from felt bottoms if you're fishing muddy banks.  I lived in the sauga and fished the credit which is rocky so felt bottoms were awesome for sticking to slimy rocks, but i've since moved to the country and all my local creeks are mud-holes......man do the felt bottoms suck here.  They collect mud and your feet end up weighing 10lbs each!"
226222,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-11 14:50:00,2050,"if I could go back I'd get stocking foot waders and two pairs of boots, 1 felt bottom and 1 rubber bottom."
226228,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 14:57:00,7971," I hear you John, and if I used them in warm weather, I'd get new ones.  I only use them to fish for steelhead from October until March....waters are quite cold.  I don't feel constricted when wearing mine and I'm actually quite comfortable in them, even when fishing all day long.  Perhaps I'm lucky...LOL."
226235,troutologist,2008-07-11 15:04:00,951,"If youre going to do any measure of cold weather fishing like fall winter steelhead id suggest a neoprene wader. But as soon as you do any walking with them in the summer you are going to sweat. Ive got pair of Simms breathables and they are the best I have ever owned.  Cliff definitly hit the nail on the head with the underlayers, in warmer weather something like dryfit or helly hansen will keep you comfortable and remove the sweat.  Spend more on good wading boots, the ankle support and comfort will make it easier stand for long periods and walking in rocky streams. I personally try to fit my boots as tight as comfortable, it seems to make walking in rapids easier for me...no sliding of the foot in the boot. I lace up tight for walking and loosen off if im fairly stationary in cold water."
226237,Meegs,2008-07-11 15:07:00,249,"Bass Pro shops sell Corkers wading boots...      they actually come with 2 different soles!    their interchangeable!     one set is felt, the other is a rugged tracked sole, like a hiking boot!      pretty sure i picked them up for under $100 but well worth the $$$ regardless!     had them 3 years now, they work great!     as well you can always buy cleats and or spikes to put in the soles.    i wouldnt think about wearing the felt soles if i didnt have the cleats during the later fall months once the snows on the ground!    Last thing you need is to go for a swim when the waters that cold!   on another bit of a side note...    REGARDLESS of what kind or brand of waders you decide to go with, Make sure you wear a wading belt!     even if its just a regular belt that you have lying around.   put it around your waist over top of the waders any time your fishing any water deeper than your hips and or moving water.    this will prevent the water from filling up your waders and becomming a REAL problem if you were ever to fall in or over!      You ever tried to get out of waders once the've filled up with water???     its not fun!    for the sake of putting a belt on, it could save your life!"
226241,highdrifter,2008-07-11 15:12:00,2534,"Waders?  Heck, if I could wear mine to work, I would.  Happy time for me would be splashing in the tub, playing with a rubber ducky, imagining I was Jacques Cousteau, all the while wearing my breathable simms..  I place high demands on my equipment, especially my waders.  I remember bying a good pair of gortex waders in 1999, and they lasted me for 6 years.  Finally had to retire them a couple years ago and bought a new pair, and I luuuvv them.. They were the Simms Guide Model Gortex.  Back in 99, I paid over $600 for them.  When  I replaced them last year, I paid half the price.  And you know what?  They were worth every single penny then, and they're worth every penny now.  I put alot of hours in them, so nickle and diming waders is not an option for me.  If you're planning on more of a conventional use, I'm sure $100 would get a pretty decent pair...  Hope this helps.  Cheers! H to the D    "
226243,Jigster,2008-07-11 15:12:00,33,"Well if you want the best value for the money the answer is easy: buy online from LL BEAN (http://www.llbean.com). The best deal is their house brand breathable Emerger waders (see link below), which retail for $99. I have them and they are quality, but the REAL KICKER is that they're GUARANTEED FOR LIFE! Even if you're ""not satisfied"" with them in 5 years time, LL Bean will get you a new pair of waders no questions asked! LL Bean's ridiculously liberal customer service policy is famous, and for good reason. They also sell Simms waders if you want high-end, and the best part is that even the Simms products are covered by the LL Bean unconditional life warranty - it's a no-brainer!  http://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/se...934-tn&np=Y"
226249,Rich,2008-07-11 15:29:00,3927,"Waders are a great investment. Go neoprene or insulated at least (neoprene is 100 times better) for cold water wading. Once you have them, you'll use them all the time and if treated right they'll last ya forever."
226308,bassmaster4,2008-07-11 17:48:00,801,be careful while wading in caledonia it could get pretty deep unexpectedly
226366,modny,2008-07-11 19:21:00,502,i think i might get a outcast pontoon boat instead. and use the troller to get up close at caledonia then drift down to york then troll her back etc..  do u think a small gas outboard like 2 or 5 hp is too big for the back of an inflatable pontoon?
226369,Rich,2008-07-11 19:23:00,3927,Check the rating on the boat. It will tell you the max horsepower restriction. Most are 2hp.
226956,BabyHerc,2008-07-13 04:28:00,285," A little off-topic, but that is an awesome picture, and would still be if the bass weighed only a pound.  Very well done."
