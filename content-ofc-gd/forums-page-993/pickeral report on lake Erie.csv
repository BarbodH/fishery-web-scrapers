230141,jeff24,2008-07-20 13:43:00,35,"Hi Don.  You'll do good. I was out there on Tuesday night.  I'm going to head back out for the day Thursday.  Here's my report from then.  There's pics if you search the post.  Hope it helps you and good luck !   Well, I picked sweetie up right from work Tuesday @4 and we headed for the lake. We were on the water by 5:30 and first fish came at 6:30. We fished SE of Port Maitland in front of Mowhak, 52 -68 Fow, running leadcore, jets, dipseys and riggers with harnesses, ripplin redfins, nk28's. Went 3 for 4 (3-7Lbs) off the water by 9pm(work night). Lead core out 6-7 colours on an inline board took 3 with a copper coloured worm harness, a rigger 40'down out 150' took the 4th. Lost one at the boat but what a awesome night on the water with a great fishing partner!"
