Okuma Induron 250 LXa.....w/ 6'-8""  Okuma EV-X..""spinnerbait"".. rod in 1 pce. Fairly reasonable in price for a total cost of $266 taxes in...spooled w/ #17 fireline crystal. Man, I really enjoy this setup..took 'er for test drive this evening... I believe the reel to be gauranteed for 5 yrs and the rod for life whatever that means. Just the same..a sweet deal if anyone is considering a baitcaster other than the low profile ones out there. I should add that included in the price was a few bags of Rage Plastics, some wide gap hooks, 4 flippin jigs and.....Bass, Lookout."
