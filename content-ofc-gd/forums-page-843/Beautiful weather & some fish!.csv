So I let them settle in before pulling anchors and moving again...  Finally found some space out away from the crowds and had a consistent screen full of fish on the sonar.  Working them on screen in real time was like playing a video game, and we had about a 10:1 ratio of fish that would commit and strike versus the others that would just follow the jig up and down the water column, sometimes up to 20 feet at a time!      A great day to be out on the water!    Tony"
344639,Roy,2009-05-25 13:50:00,13728,Beautiful fish Tony. Congrats to you and your wife.
344640,Zubris21,2009-05-25 13:56:00,563,Healthy looking fish!  thanks for the report.

344697,Jay T,2009-05-25 17:02:00,282,"Some good looking fish there, congrats. I was out there on Saturday and got 2 whities and a laker."
344701,John,2009-05-25 17:06:00,2956,Great looking fish Tony. Thanks for the report.
344704,Slyatv,2009-05-25 17:16:00,45,Wtg Tony ! ! Was great to see your New boat some day I'll get a ride in it ! !
344777,tonyb,2009-05-25 23:47:00,1637,"For sure sly! if not up there on Simcoe then I would be glad to put you onto some Salmon and Trout out on Lady O...  I forgot to mention, fish were taken on Bad Boy jigs, half n half hammered williams ice jig, and the Blue Fox jig"
344827,Leecher,2009-05-26 01:19:00,7832,Excellent job you guys Beauty lakers Thanks for sharing Leechman
344836,Joey,2009-05-26 01:24:00,9122,"Guess I should have listened to you Tony  We hit Lake O and got nada  You did great, enjoy your cucumber fish  Joey"
344839,Dara,2009-05-26 01:26:00,3052,"Good deal...we been having crappy weather and no fish. The weather is picking up now, hope the fishing is too."
344844,solopaddler,2009-05-26 01:28:00,8605,"Great stuff Tony!  You're motor looks freakin' huge man, exactly what is it? LOL!"
344859,tonyb,2009-05-26 03:28:00,1637,"Mercury Verado...quiet, clean and refined.  At idle the stream of water peeing out of the engine is pretty much the only sound to indicate the engine is running.  At WOT you can have a regular outdoor conversation"
344869,solopaddler,2009-05-26 08:28:00,8605," Sweet. So what is it, like 500hp?"
344871,rhare,2009-05-26 09:45:00,387,Some beauties there Tony good shootin'  PS: nice shirt!
344890,Greencoachdog,2009-05-26 11:28:00,8163,Some real nice fish Tony!!!  Looks like the Whitefish are headed for some hot oil eh!!!
344920,CLofchik,2009-05-26 12:52:00,854,Question:  Why don't more people give jigging a shot on Lake O greasers and do you think it would work for a smaller boat?
344924,tonyb,2009-05-26 12:59:00,1637,"Solo - 225HP can get you to a spot at 51-54MPH depending on who is in the boat  GCD - I had a fish fry last night, with 5 more meals remaining (each fillet is the perfect amount for me and Amanda)  Clof - People do jig for Lake Trout on Lake O...it is very popular at the Niagara Bar, even in smaller boats on calm days, and I don't see why it wouldn't work elsewhere...just more efficient to troll for 'em."
344936,Joeytier,2009-05-26 13:28:00,3990,Great report.  That laker is a hog!  I've still only managed whities out of simcoe.
