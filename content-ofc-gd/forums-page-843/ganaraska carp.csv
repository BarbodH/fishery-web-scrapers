Just using canned corn for those who care. Bonus a Large mouth nailed my corn as it hit the water. no picture as it's out of season so quickly released."
345008,Victor,2009-05-26 15:30:00,1609,"That's a nice sized carp, and looks like a decent day to fish as well. I've yet to have a largemouth that smashed my ""top-water-corn"" but I have heard it happen, pretty funny indeed.  Just a side note though, if you're not planning to keep them, try to avoid holding them by the gill plate.  Thanks for the report."
345010,fishing,2009-05-26 15:34:00,167,Nice fish and thanks for the report.

345052,forgottofish,2009-05-26 18:35:00,8,"Your right Victor. Usually I don't even take them out of the water, I just reach down with my pliers and remove the hook, We just did this for the pics The area is just south of the cn tracks it's pretty boring to look at really"
