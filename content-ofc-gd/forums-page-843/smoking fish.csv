Prop up the grill either high enough over the fire or more usually off to the side a bit, (downwind of the smoke). Butterfly fillet the fish, spread it out on the grill skin side down and baste occasionally with a mixture of honey garlic and butter. Takes a bit of time, usually 3-4 hours without letting the fire get too hot. Definitely worth it though, very yummy."
