These things fight so hard. I was using a Zara Spook and they totally demolish the bait. Its a fun way to fish for them! I lost a really big one right at shore that was pushing 10lbs. I went to drag it on to shore and the hooks popped out. Oh well, i let them go any ways.     "

345281,Greencoachdog,2009-05-27 02:27:00,8163,"Great report and pics Matt!!!  ... but I believe those 2 in the pics are actually White Bass, the Wipers lines are a lot more broken up and darker than on those fish.... but I could be wrong.  There are 2 different crosses for the Wiper, one uses White Bass milt and Striped Bass eggs (that's the Wiper we have here) and the other uses Striped Bass milt and White Bass eggs which is also known as the Sunshine Bass and may be what those fish are."
