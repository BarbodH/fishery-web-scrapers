Anyways my better half and I fished mostly for crappie and eyes and caught these decent keepers.   The Crappie was in my self-imposed keeper slot (9-11"") and the Eye was 15"" both swam the livewell of death. Several perch have been caught and released from the killer livewell in the past and again a 10"" perch was released to swim and be caught another day. Ended the day with 4 perch, 3 bluegills, 1 sunfish, 1 crappie, 1 walleye and gently released 2 largemouth and 1 smallmouth at boatside. Had a great multi-species day. Not bad for only a few hours in the afternoon."
344922,jediangler,2009-05-26 12:53:00,1923,Way to go guys. Most of the Bog reports this past weekend have been pretty fishless. All this talk about a new moon or something turning the fish off. Glad to see you could find a few biters.
344934,Joeytier,2009-05-26 13:21:00,3990,Good going.  That's about as big as the eyes seem to get in the bog nowadays.  Probably because their caught and kept before they get any bigger.

345348,Leecher,2009-05-27 13:17:00,7832,Sounds like you guys had a blast out there.... great job on the multi species Thanks for sharing Leechman
345390,limeyangler,2009-05-27 14:30:00,5204,Definitely not bad for a couple of hours.  Good report.  Cheers.
