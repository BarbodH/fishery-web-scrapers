344812,Dara,2009-05-26 00:48:00,3052,I got it  a week or so ago and finally got some pictures.  First the old one. She was a good rig.  
344817,Dara,2009-05-26 00:58:00,3052,"Last weekens I took the kids out for a first trip.    Needed downrigger mounting spots. I grabbed a bit of stainless steel from work and had the guys cut and bend it for me. Then took it home and marked, drilled, and polished it with an orbital sander. They came out pretty nice. I think I should scrape the green paint off the mounts from the previous boat.    I didn't want to add any holes and they fit right where the cleats were so I just matched the holes. I went with 1/8  thick rather than 1/4 so I could even use the same bolts.  "
