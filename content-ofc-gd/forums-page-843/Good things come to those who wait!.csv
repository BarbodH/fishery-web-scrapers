343940,tonyb,2009-05-22 15:13:00,1637,"Congrats! You already know, but you are going to love the comfort and fishability of that boat.  You will be amazed at the smoothness of the DTS shifting and how quiet the Verado is  A very well-informed decision and like most things in life it is better to wait and do it right than rush into something you won't be satisfied with.  If you PM me your email I can send you a great document about care, maintenance and general info for your Verado, some great information in it.  Cheers, Tony"
