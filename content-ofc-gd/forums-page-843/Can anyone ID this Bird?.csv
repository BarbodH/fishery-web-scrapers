344081,Cudz,2009-05-23 01:46:00,2652,looks like a barn swallow
344084,Fisherman,2009-05-23 01:50:00,7201,Swallow..and they swallow lots of flying bugs.
344085,gogu392,2009-05-23 01:50:00,142,It is a swallow. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow for more details. These birds are masters of acrobatcis in air. They fly very fast and with short turns. The diet is mostly flying insects. They show up in Spring time from south and disaper in fall. The nest is made from mud and hay.
344095,Silo Buster,2009-05-23 02:08:00,81,"Swallow for sure...  Everyday for the last week when my son gets off the bus from school,walking in the lane he gets bombarded by a couple of them.He's 10 ,but is kinda freaked out by them."
344099,GoneFishin,2009-05-23 02:16:00,349," Lol, every day I walk down to go fishing I have swallows flying in circles around me trying to catch bugs that are trying to use me to hide behind."
344103,Gerritt,2009-05-23 02:25:00,6129,Looks like a Swallow to me as well... I have a pair of tree swallows occupying one of my bird houses...They are pretty birds... but can be aggressive..  G
344392,singingdog,2009-05-24 11:16:00,1047,"Definitly a Barn Swallow. They are the easiest of the swallows to ID, by the long, forked tail. Should be fun to watch them raise their young."
344475,Greencoachdog,2009-05-24 18:28:00,8163,"It is indeed a Barn Swallow, I ID'ed it in my Audubon Bird book before posting it.. and posted it because it's a pretty good pic and to see who would take the time to ID it here.  They're amazing little birds that spend more time in the air than almost any other bird! They winter in the tropics, some as far south as central Argentina and come to North America to nest and raise their young.  They're very active and industrious!  This a pic of the nest, I think it's either almost finished or finished:    They take the mud from my vegetable garden in the mornings after I water it!   They're kind of messy little buggars, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of bugs they'll eat!    A couple minutes with the powerwasher will clean that up!  I aggravate them a little by sitting at my picnic table so I can watch them fly around me."
344567,holdfast,2009-05-25 01:53:00,1813,"AHA, you are a NERD.   BIRD WATCHING are We?"
344573,Greencoachdog,2009-05-25 02:14:00,8163,"Hey now!!!... I really like my birds!  If you want to see a good fight, watch a male Mockingbird pick a fight with a male Killdeer and get his    whooped!!!  It really tickled me, first time I'd seen Mr. Mockbird lose a fight!!!"
344642,Rattletrap2,2009-05-25 14:00:00,1652,I always thought Bama WAS in the Tropics! Why would the little fellow want to winter anywars else? LOL
344652,motv8tr,2009-05-25 14:15:00,2587,very pretty indeed....could use a few bug eaters up here...  Maureen
344663,limeyangler,2009-05-25 14:58:00,5204,Thats a musky!.....what do you think your doing posting pics of out of season species!!!!!
344958,legacey,2009-05-26 14:16:00,127," They can be really aggressive as Gerritt wrote. I had a nest of them above the front door of my house one year. In the morning when I'd sit on the step and have my coffee before work, they'd dive bomb me.  I'd be running around, flailing coffee and screaming like a banshee....when they left for the season, I took it down and will never let that happen again.  Cheers"
