Got out to our usual starting point on the Bay and decided to use minnows first off.  I went with large minnow set down about 5 feet with a bobber, nice and lazy fishing.  Eric set up a lindy rig with a large minnow.  Well Erics Lindy seemed to work right off the bat with what turned out to be the largest pike of the day at a respectable 30"".    We caught 7 pike in total and a large oos smallie.  And the capper of the day was a real nice eye caught while trolling in 5 ft of water.  It measured just over 20"".     Not to bad for a couple of hours.  One thing that is starting to get on my nerves is the wind! :evil:   Man it seems like everday is windy.  I really hope it isnt like this all summer. I HATE WHEN IT IS WINDY! :twisted:  Anyway not a spectacular report but better than nothing."
