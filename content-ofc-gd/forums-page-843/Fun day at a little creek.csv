344667,brifishrgy,2009-05-25 15:10:00,559,watched Facts of Fishing Sat morning (fly fishing for Gar) with my son and he says he wants to try fly fishing .. I dug out the rod and cleaned off the dust (been sitting for years) and showed him how to cast it .. he was practicing in the yard for a half hour on Sat afternoon while I got the boat all ready to go for Sunday morning .. we were planning on heading out to Dunnville for some eyes and cats Sunday morning but he wanted to fly fish .. took him to 16 mile creek for some practice  short video (couldn't figure out how to put in in the post )  http://s602.photobucket.com/albums/tt108/b...nt=P5230008.flv    he even managed to catch a few creek chubs    and in typical Dave fashion we had to end the day with Subway
