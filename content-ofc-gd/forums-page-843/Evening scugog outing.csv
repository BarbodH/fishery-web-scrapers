Moved quietly along weed edges with the electric looking for target fish. Didn't end up with much though. Managed one decent bog eye at about 16"" and a crappie about 10-11"". Caught some chunky largemouth released at boatside and a handful of other panfish. I could not believe the colours that the sky presented us that evening. Unbelievably relaxing...just sitting back, staring at the sky and letting the cool breeze carry us.... all this while eating a spicy chicken sandwich with a coke from Wendy's  Here are some pics... didn't get any of the fish cause it was pretty dark already.

344975,frozen-fire,2009-05-26 14:37:00,542,"My fishing buddy (one who took the pics) and myself both have the same camera (Canon Rebel XSi). On our outing, he was using his new lens, the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5. I am crazy jealous, but don't have the coin to drop on a lens like that."
344994,frozen-fire,2009-05-26 14:58:00,542,  Your steel reports are getting to me. Perhaps I should take the plunge into river fishing. You'll have to teach me everything you know though.
345006,Victor,2009-05-26 15:27:00,1609,"Amazing pics man, so this is your maiden voyage on the sportspal? Congrats for sliming up the new-to-you canoe!  Actually, I don't know if I should believe you or not, since there was no fish pics, and the few times that i went to scugog i only caught small WGSF   haha, thanks for the report."
345013,frozen-fire,2009-05-26 15:43:00,542," No... maiden voyage was a few weeks ago, got a lot more crappie and some oos bass. dad managed to land this big muskie. it never touched the boat though as it was released immediately. I still remember clearly cause I got soaked by the huge splash as it took off... was freezing the rest of the outing haha  Hard to imagine a 40"" fish going for a 1.5"" tube under a float!  I hope to take it out on muskie opener and get it slimed for real"
