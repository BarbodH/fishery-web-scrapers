343222,Law grad,2009-05-20 14:08:00,1,"Mike, Not sure if you are still considering the Natural Resources Law Enforcement Program at Fleming or not but I thought I would give you some incite as a recent graduate of the program. The NR law program is indeed a great program. If you are interested in pursuing a career in Natural Resources Law Enforcement this is the best program to take. This program is highly regarded though out Canada for its ability to produce knowledgeable graduates. One of the big bonuses of this program is that it will give you a great base for any law enforcement job. Students that graduated in my class have found work as Park wardens (in both Provincial and Natural parks), RCMP officers, Environment Canada officers, Correctional officers, and some such as myself have found employment as Fishery Officers. (In fact out of the 8 Fishery Officers in Ontario, 6 of them graduated from this program) I would recommend that you not limit yourself to CO Jobs in Ontario as these are very difficult to get. If however you are willing to move, or consider law enforcement positions other than an Ontario CO, this is by far the best program to take. The courses field work and class room portions will prepare you for the realities of a Law Enforcement career. If you have any interest in talking to any of the programs past grads I would highly recommend that you contact Mark Riemenschneider (705) 749-5530 ext. 3394 the program coordinator. He would be more then happy to connect you to a past grad. Good luck in your studies Mike!"

Great school, meet and I'm still friends with some great people, teacher are good, its a community unlike any other college I've been to and I've graduated from 3.  Its the only collage I went that had around 2000 students and could put together 20 intramural hockey teams and each team had to have 2 girls. A community is a great way to describe it at least it was 15 years ago it was.  Even though I never worked a day in aquaculture after a graduated I don't regret spending the time or the money.  Look at it as a place to start building a career, because after you go there other opportunities and ideas will come forward you never even thought of.  Education is never a bad idea."

I love the hands on work and everybody was really enjoying their self.

After graduating, the harsh reality presented itself in the job world.  Low income salary or contract work was the norm in ON.  You need to ask yourself what range of salary you can realistically live with, and then work back from there.  A $25-30K salary wasn't exactly the payoff I was hoping for after investing 2 years into something I am passionate about.  I love it, but the cost of living the lifestyle I wanted was too rich for the meager earnings possible with that education.  The following fall after graduating I went back to college in a completely unrelated field, IT, and it has afforded me the lifestyle I want.  I still love fishing and outdoors, and now I can enjoy it on the weekend and afford all the toys that go along with it!

289087,kingjames_2nd,2009-01-07 19:37:00,72,"I am currently at Fleming, Frost Campus taking the 1 year Post-Grad GIS Cartography  program.  I am extremely happy with the way I am treated by the instructors.  The quality of the education seems to be very good too.  I would rate my experience so far as 9 / 10.  In contrast, I earned a BA at university before coming here and feel that I am treated like more of a human here.  The administration still treats me like a pile of money though, which I hate.  I never felt like anybody cared whether I succeeded or not when I was at university.  At fleming they seem to care (or pretend to?).  In addition, I worked out in Alberta this past summer and met a number of  Fish and wildlife officers / CO's / ""Guardians"".   2 or 3 of them had come from fleming within the last few years; they were doing seasonal contracts.  The impression I got was that it is hard to get into full time work right away."
289116,Sherriff,2009-01-07 20:34:00,252,"I went to Fleming in 97 or so and wanted to be a CO like many others.  Luckily, they offer a common first year program where you take a class in everything they offer.  I hope they still do this.  It was a great experience.  I was also told about the % that get jobs after graduation in the many courses they offer and I believe they were fairly honest.  After thinking things through, I went into Cartography and GIS.  This allowed me to still be involved somewhat in Natural Resources and also have a decent opportunity to find employment as well.  The bonus for me was that I was not computer savoy at all and Cart/GIS was some manual map production and tons of digital map production.  This forced me to learn to use a pc.  By doing this I was always able to find work during my summers off and after graduating.  I think that working in your choosen field during your summers off is a HUGE advantage over others.  Many of my classmates graduated with 2 dilpomas like I did but I had three summers of work experience and that gave me the edge for jobs.  I also worked for very low hourly wages and would travel anywhere I had to for work.  Some classmates stayed local and worked in factories making a ton of cash but sadly they were not able to offer anything on top of a couple dilpomas when it came time to look for a career.  So even though I was not able to be the CO I wanted to be, I was able to work in forestry while in BC, at Fisheries and Oceans here in Ontario, the MTO and now I work for a municipality.  I think that we have 20-30 Fleming grads working here in our Public Works department alone.  If you want to still go into F&W, then do it but try to get as much experience before graduation as you can.  And, be willing to move anywhere you need to for work.  I am sure you will find something......  As far as Fleming goes, I really enjoyed my time there and think it is a great school.  When it comes to  GIS, at the time I was at Fleming they were the experts in training GIS professionals.  I think now every college and university offers it so employers now have many more applicants to choose from.  Hopefully, Fleming is still highly regarded by employers in GIS and other courses so that they can help grads find jobs...  Good luck.  Sherriff"

I came into this program with the view that there was some sort of hiring for that, but theres not really one. When you put in an application for one of the CO jobs when they pop up, you have to remember that theres probably hundreds of resumes flowing in at the same time. You need countless hours of related volunteer time and related work, or, be extreamly luckey and get in after college. Your best bet is to really deeply evaluate what you want to do, if you had to do something, everyday for the rest of your life... problem is a CO job sounds f-in great. Some good advice for you though, look on monster.ca or workopolis.com and look at job postings for related FW jobs, look at their qualifications section, and try to start meeting as many of those as you can (eg: first aid, drivers licence, boat licence, familarize yourself with fish and wildlife conservation act, get your hunting + firearms licence, VOLUNTEER, ect ect ect).

Then I went to Lakeland College in Alberta and got an Applied Degree in Environmental Management. I found work with as an Environmental Consultant remediating contaminanted sites and Co-ordinating geotechnical surreys and construction projects. I'm in a different environmental field now with a much larger employer. The money is good and the hours are better.  A friend of mine from common semester became a CO shortly after Fleming. He was successful because he wasn't afraid to go where the job was. I ran into him in Kenora when I was doing a job up there about 7 years ago and then just last year he checked my fishing party on Mitchell's Bay by Chatham - small world. Expect a lot of contract and short term positions when you start out. Eventually, the stability comes. When I worked as a student at a provincial park the Assistant Park Superintendant told me he worked with the MNR for 20 years before getting on fulltime. That's something to think about too.  The Fish and Wildlife Tech program is really geared for goverment and especially the MNR and Conservation Authorities. Government is hiring a lot more now and this is a great time to get in. The baby boomers are retiring and jobs are opening up."

I would take a look at ET or EM closely before taking fish... And in reality the best course offered there for work is Drilling...LOTS of work. Just my opinion.

I have two post secondary diplomas and havent found anything in that field. i ended up managing construction projects in florida and just recently moved back to ontario. either way you look at it, if want to make a good amount of money you are going to move around quite a bit.

I did, however get accepted into the U of Guelph F&W biology program.  I stuck it out for 3 semesters, but it wasn't for me.  I moved to Thunder Bay and did the aviation program at Confederation College.  While in Thunder Bay and other spots in NW Ontario, I met and worked with a lot of SSF grads, all of whom had nothing but accolades for the school and F&W program.  They all tried to convince me to reapply to SSF, but I never did.  Despite the fact that I had great fun working as a bush pilot for a few years and then spending 27+ fantastic years in the Air Force, I still sometimes regret not following my dream and going after that F&W program at SSF.

You have to work at anything, if you want to do well. I was lucky, I had years of work experience before I went back to college, a solid resume, and I'm also a huge fish and wildlife nut.

One of my best friends took that program. He is currently the manager of a drilling and blasting company and he will tell you that the work and money is not there for everyone. The big money is hard to comeby and always far away in remote places like the arctic. New hires don't make a lot of money and the hours are long and the work is often boring and repetitive. Don't take drilling if you are looking for a big money career and certainly don't take it if you don't have an interest in the work. Of course, if you think $14 an hour is big money then ignore what I just said.  I should also add that my friend just laid everyone off before Christmas and he has no idea when he can bring guys back or how many he will bring back."

I do however need to agree with Gerritt, the chances of turning it into a career are kinda slim.  None of my friends that have graduated are currently doing anything related to that field.  If I could make one recommendation, I would look into some programs that are more directed towards forestry management, and environmental sustainability.  I think there are more career opportunities and you're still focusing your education on the outdoors.

They should put that program on hold until there is a viable market for that profession in Ontario.

It should also be noted that there is a TON of competition out there for very few positions that do arise??.... having a simple diploma from a community college will probably not be enough to ""beat out"" the other applicants....

288967,jonnybass,2009-01-07 16:16:00,346," I know this all too well. I changed programs after my first year in University when I found out from talking to recent grads what the real market value of the degree was. lol Needless to say, the program is still being offered because of the perceived value of the degree. In that case, most students realize after they graduate that the perception was based more so on the prestige associated with this particular degree, rather than real-world demand. My ex stayed in the program and never started a career in finance as she had expected.  In this kid's case, you gave an excellent example in comparing his diploma to a humanities degree. Equally worthless.  But, he is taking a program that is highly specialized unlike a humanities degree. He has or should have a reasonable expectation for employment in that field. Colleges have a reputation of excelling in this arena, and that's why kids attend them. Sadly in this case, his expectation is based on a false perception.  Now, there was probably a healthy demand for this diploma when the program was first initiated, but as we see, demand for this diploma (available jobs) have all but dried up.  If students will pay, of course the college will fill it. It's good business sense. However, you end up with 500 grads fighting for 5 CO openings and a program director telling his prospects that ""a lot(not all) grads get jobs as CO's etc..""  The college is essentially selling him a lottery ticket, when he was expecting a meal ticket.  Although it may not make ""business sense"", it makes common sense for a college to suspend a program that does not fill a demand in the current job environment. After all, that's what colleges are there for. Or so I thought."
288972,Sinker,2009-01-07 16:23:00,8692,"I graduated from Fleming in a different program. I thought long and hard about taking the F&W program too, but there is just not as many jobs out there in that field. If your willing to travel around and keep doing contract work here and there, by all means.....go for it!  I took the Environmental Technology program, and got a full time permanent job as soon as I graduated. ET is basically everything you need to know about water. There are lots of jobs in the environmental field, take a look sometime.  The ET program has a breat job success rate, and most of the work is outdoorsy/field work.  Check all your options first. I know a lot of people took the 2 yr F&W, then opted to take the one year ET program, and ended up working in an ET related field. I have lots of buds who took fish and they aren't doing any field related work at all.  Fish is a great program, and you'll really enjoy it, which helps with your marks, but the jobs are hard to come by. You'd prolly end up at Trent U for more biology, or related coursed in order to get a good, permanent job.  Just my thoughts,  Sinker"
288973,jonnybass,2009-01-07 16:24:00,346," I didn't see this post before I made my last post.  That's cool, if there are other jobs other than CO that you are interested in that you can fall back on, then it's a little less risky!  I had the impression that all you eggs were in the CO basket so to speak.  I wish you all the best and good luck!"
288974,steverowbotham,2009-01-07 16:28:00,1800,"Here goes...  I just graduated the program, the third year of FW.  I love the program and everything about it.  Jobs.... there are jobs, but not many CO jobs if thats wha your looking for.  I know 2 people from my time that got CO jobs.  If you're willing to move, theres a ton of work.  I have friends in BC, AB, YK, NWT, TX, MT, QC, WY all of whom have awesome jobs that they love.... notice a pattern??  If you stick to Ontario, its all contract work."
288979,Sinker,2009-01-07 16:33:00,8692," Did you get a field related job when you were done?  As much as I am a fish and wildlife nut, I'm glad I didnt' take the program. I'm sure I could have walked right through it with straight A's, but with a young family, it just wasn't the right thing to do!! I went back to school to get a full time permanent job........mission accomplished!  Sinker"

288991,anders,2009-01-07 16:50:00,1168,"Flemming Sucks!  Sault College Rocks!  Sorry...had to throw that in.  Good for you for continuing your education.  Like many of the previous posts here, i completed th F&W program at Sault College, and then decided to go for my GIS diploma.  There just wasnt the jobs in Fish and when they were they were contract jobs.  Not really the living i wanted.  My job now is GIS.  Keep your options open when you complete your degree.  Also, food for thought, after college, look at universities to see if you can use your diploma for university credits and get a degree.  Good luck in whatever you choose.  Anders"
288994,Ramble,2009-01-07 17:02:00,713,"Ahhh Fleming. I graduated 2 years of F & W. Best teachers i have ever come accross. I live with a 3rd year grad currently, we are both at trent furthering our studies. He is an Enviromental science major, and im doing a joint major between Enviro Sci and Biology. The CO route is a kind of a joke in my opinon. But to each their own. I know of guys who got the job they were looking for, but not in Ontario. A few even landed jobs with the DFO. Those guys have a real budget. Don't let a few nay-sayers crap on your goals, if you want it bad enough you can get it. But you should also remain flexable. Ontario F&W life work is a lot of contract stuff. But i have a friend who got in with the MNR at a hatchery and has fulltime work and good pay. The jobs are out their, but you have to be flexable. My room mate in college did 2 years of fish, found out about the contract work and took a year of forestry. 3 years of college 2 diplomas. You will be far better off in the wildlife field then any of these kids who just do straight University. Uni doesnt teach you much in the way of identificaion and management the way fleming does.  College Diploma and Uni degree are a killer double team. If you do 3 years of fish you can get your honours in Biology in 2 years from Trent. How awesome is that? The reports you do in 3rd year at Fleming are harder then 4th year university class, so you will be well prepared.  Good luck man, some of the best people i have ever met went to that school. There is no where else like it in the world. Anyone else here ever skinned a 500lb black bear with their prof on a class room floor?  -R-"
288999,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-07 17:11:00,3761," Thanks for the advice, the thing is i would love to move to another province and get that job that i need. There is nothing wrong with change and i would love to do something like this. But im pretty sure this fish and wildlife technology program is a 3 year program now...and my plan was to take the Natural Resources-Law Enforcement program as my ""2nd step"". I think i was misunderstood by people thinking i want to be a conservation officer and nothing else. The good thing with these programs is that they open the door's to very many oppurtunities and options once completing college. And after every year working as a summer student with CLOCA would be a great deal of experience for myself. I have only done about 40 hours of community service with CLOCA and i have loved every minute"
