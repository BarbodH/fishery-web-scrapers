345276,jediangler,2009-05-27 02:19:00,1923,That would be Deihl Point according to the map I looked at. There are only 7 cottages on that island and three of them are facing Fenelon Falls. Where's the closest public launch? Let's get this WGSF derby going   .
345280,spinnerbaitking,2009-05-27 02:24:00,1622," I haven't fished cameron in a few years but I would go with you or take you with me, a tourney sounds good, everyone needs a rod with a 3"" dardevle on it and when they come out let them have it, likely won't do that again it worked for me in a different incident Richard Definately report them, GPS co-ordinates please"
345286,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-27 02:41:00,835,Never be afraid to call a cop to come do their job. We have so many here that they are bored stiff looking for something to do.
345294,holdfast,2009-05-27 03:28:00,1813,"  LOL, You're absolutely wrong Sherlock,  Nope, I'M a pretty good guy and mind my own Business most times.  However I do have my pet Peeves.  Not knowing what a racist is Pulling the Race Card Jumping to conclusions Ganging up Not standing up for one self and Cry Babies Dissing the Military, Police, or any other Canadian Authority figure Lemmings Left Wing do gooders that think all of us should be like them.  But Pick on people of different Color, Race, Language, Gender or what ever.  I think not.  But force me to Change my ways for theirs, or tell me my way is wrong, Call me a Racist because Im a Passionate Canadian. Yea Ill say something."
345302,pikehunter,2009-05-27 10:06:00,1659,"The tale makes me want to ask. If they were being harassed in such a way why did they not offer to call the police themselves? That is if they had a cellphone at hand. The threat of them calling the cops on the harasser would have turned the table on him. Just a quick call to 911 to report that their safety was being threatened just might have sent him on his way. A threat is a threat and if he pulled a knife to cut an anchor line is enough to put anyone's safety in jeopardy.  We had a neighbour in an apartment years ago. I went and asked him in a polite way to cut the noise out one evening. He jumps over to the kitchen drawer and pulls out a cleaver and waves it at me hollering something in whatever language. Did it faze me? No. I laughed in his face, shook my head then went back downstairs and called the cops. In minutes 3 cops show up. I asked them to just go and talk to the guy and the sight of their uniforms would be enough to get the message across that you just don't do that on this side of the world. Never had an incident with him again."
345304,Randy,2009-05-27 10:37:00,115,"HearingFish, as an angler of Asian decent born in Canada I understand the predicament you guys found yourself. For those who are not of a visible minority really don't appreciate the level of racism in Canadian society because they don't face it on a daily basis. Granted the racism is not as obvious and pervasive as in many other countries, but the innuendos are pretty hard to miss.  Nipper Tipping in Lake Simcoe occurred for many years because it was a local accepted practice and until recently, the light of racism wasn't shone on it. Now that is has been exposed, people are now learning what was happening in the shadows. So until these things are exposed, they will continue. So I would suggest that the incident be reported. I suspect that there are many others who have been affected and they may come forward, just like at Lake Simcoe. Maybe the Human Rights Commissioner will also look at incidents on Cameron Lake as she did at Lake Simcoe."
345317,big guy,2009-05-27 11:57:00,414,"I came in kind of late to the discussion obviously, but just a thought here.  Maybe the incident was sparked because the gentlemen who were fishing were keeping everything they were catching (or more than what the man deemed adequate) and it has nothing to do with race at all.  I know they or anyone is well within the law to keep all of those types of fish, but it has been brought up on this board a few times, that even for panfish, maybe there should be limits. Maybe the guy has strong beliefs about keeping the fishery in tact on ""his"" lake and went about it the wrong way.  I don't know what the man's motivation was and I'm pretty sure that until he was asked to his face none of us on this board know either. Sometimes it seems all too convenient to bring out the race card to try and rationalize someone's behaviour, maybe the reason he never approached the boat filled with caucasions is because they weren't keeping many of the fish they were keeping. Maybe the incident has more to do with conservation than race."
345325,big guy,2009-05-27 12:12:00,414,"  Seriously?  Wow, simply wow."

345331,Marko,2009-05-27 12:47:00,854,"Even if they were keeping everything they were catching, as long as they are within the regs its none of his business. Nobody has right to go up to you and threaten you because you are fishing on a lake, thats not privately owned, if they were trespassing then that's another story. If you cant call the cops to come and help you from a lunatic who the hell do you turn to then?"

345046,cram,2009-05-26 18:07:00,1733,"Uninformed and ignorant, sure....but aren't you kind of being racist by implying the white guy was being a racist?  Did he say anything that seemed racist, or are you assuming?   I honestly don't think the police will/can do anything now.   Maybe they should go back to that spot, fish again, and call the police if the guy comes out again."
345047,lunkerbasshunter,2009-05-26 18:28:00,2585,i would have called the cops for them and let the cops tell them there were being you know whats  cheers!

The guy was being an idiot and interfering with someone else enjoying the fishing, it wasn't about race. The cops should have been called then and there,  there's point of whining about now."
345114,Sinker,2009-05-26 21:30:00,8692,"Well, I'll tell ya, if some guy came up to my boat, and even laid a hand on it (or my anchor line) while threatening me, I'd go into self defense mode. I don't care if he's white/yellow/black.....or pink!  I think he'd be paddling with his ass back to shore.  reporting it now is a waste of time though if you ask me. Too little too late. They should have been on the phone while this guy was threatining them. I'd be going back there every chance I got though, thats for sure!!!!  Sinker"
345116,holdfast,2009-05-26 21:32:00,1813," Sorry Dawg, I'm with Cram on this one.  The Cops have better things to do than Deal with the Big Bad White Guy and Marital disputes.  Ive met Big Mouths like that think they own the Joint down there, (Cottage Country) but I always figure if you cant fend for yourself Back Off.  As far as bringing in the media and stuff, lets not make this a Race Issue of which it can easily be or already is.  You know what side the Media will sensationalize.  Been there done that.  The problem is in these small cottage lakes,  EVERYONE, white Black or Asian is treated like an outsider.  Maybe Honkey thought the (Asians, Humanoids, Newbies, Intruders, were really illegally fishing).  Gad I hope we don't have this Racist, Cry-baby crap like this infiltrating Northern Saskatchewan. Bad enough with our First Nations.  What a bunch of Cry Babies, Betcha The White Mouth Piece would of backed off if the Asians threatened KUNG_FU.  By the way, is anybody else having problems with getting through on the Board."
345118,JohnF,2009-05-26 21:43:00,3494," Somebody tells me to produce a licence better be prepared to produce proof they're an enforcement officer first. When they can't I start noting details of their boat, appearance etc, and advising them that I'll be going to the authorities with the idea of getting them charged for impersonating a leo. Hopefully they aren't bigger and tougher than me.  Is this why serious fisherpersons have such huge motors on their boats - to escape?  JF"
345119,JohnF,2009-05-26 21:45:00,3494,Another alternative occurs to me - why not gather up a huge herd of large sized friends and take them to the same spot to fish. See who comes out - or doesn't.  JF
345120,kickingfrog,2009-05-26 21:50:00,8333,"Loudmouth bullies want to tell everyone else how they should act and fish.

Or he kicks your butt and sues you because he hurt his hand hitting your face. Lose, lose.  Police officers are peace officers, at the very least a phone call would start a paper trail of behaviour that may be useful if there are further incidents."
345122,JohnF,2009-05-26 21:52:00,3494, Sorry. I see that a number of folks already suggested that.  As for whether or not it was racially motivated - does it really matter? It's still wrong. If race was at issue then perhaps even worse.  JF

345149,yo_guy,2009-05-26 22:28:00,111,Sorry to hear about that Stan.  The perfect solution is to oraganize a RockBass Bonanza on July 11 & 12 which is the next Free Family Fishing Weekend.

This is regardless of ANY difference (skin color, accent, religion, gender, etc...).  Best thing to do with these people is leave them alone / ignore them. Ignoring people is very rewarding although very hard to do! But it is very satisfying.  You will not change this by reporting it, but next time tell them to get lost! You are as much a Canadian as they are, if not more so probably by the way they are acting.  It's funny how so many people think this land is theirs, just because they / their family have inhabited it for a few decades after decimating the original tenants, and then have the gall to discriminate on others. Despicable, it's a shame we will NEVER get along, not all of us at least, and not in this lifetime."

345263,danbouck,2009-05-27 01:43:00,4380,I'm in for the WGSF tourney!
344982,wuchikubo,2009-05-26 14:50:00,1114,"I'm asking for a friend.  My friend and colleague who fished Cameron Lake for the first time with another friend on Saturday were out fishing for crappie but found none ended up fishing a bay for sunfish and rockbass. Both of these guys have fished for many years without incident until this past weekend. One is a senior and a resident of Ontario, the other is licensed with sport fishing license and a resident of Ontario.  The details as it has been told to me:  As they were fishing in their boat in a bay area beyond the casting range of some cottages they were approached by a local fellow of non-Asian decent who rowed his boat out to them and proceeded to tell them to release all of the fish and leave as the fish they were catching and keeping (about 20 between the two of them) were undersized (large bluegill and about 1/2 -3/4 lb rockbass). This fellow then threatened to call the police, if they didn't comply. My friends who are aware of the fishing regs mentioned to the fellow that the fish kept were panfish and that they were not doing anything illegal then told the fellow to call the police. This individual then started shouting and got more threatening and raised his oar and threatened to cut their anchor line if they didn't leave immediately.  My friends decided to release the fish and leave than to escalate the situation. This local fellow didn't approach other boats with some younger Caucasian anglers nearby but a little further out in the bay.  They decided not to call the authorities immediately and to shrug off the incident.  Question:  Should my friends consider reporting the incident, as it seems to me that the individual that approached them was in the wrong in terms of obstructing their peaceful fishing. Or should they let it slide and consider it an isolated incident?  My concerns are more for the safety of future anglers that may come across this individual.  I don't really wish to play the racism card but it sure sounded like a case.  I've re-checked the regs fro FMZ 17 and didn't find Cameron lake to have any exceptions to the regular limits (none for sunfish) or for slot size for such panfish. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Thanks,  Stan"
344985,frozen-fire,2009-05-26 14:54:00,542,"Wow... As an asian angler, it hurts to read stuff like this. I was thinking of trying Cameron, but I think I'll avoid it now. I would contact authorities."
344988,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-26 14:56:00,0,If it went the way you said it did. They should have told buddy to call the police and when the police arrived your friends should have had buddy charged with uttering threats.  but who's to say how it went.......
344991,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-26 14:57:00,10439,They should definately report the incident. What that person did was against the law and as such he should be charged. Call both the MNR and the Local Police to report this persons activity.
344992,blaque,2009-05-26 14:58:00,2419,Youch.......sure sounds strange............i cant even muster up a comment on this one

344998,Banger68,2009-05-26 15:06:00,157,Report him and hopefully save somebody else from having to go through the same thing.
345002,capt bruce,2009-05-26 15:12:00,820,"The crime as I see it (if things did happen as stated), is that your friends did not call the police and have this red neck charged .

345021,Weekend Warrior,2009-05-26 15:55:00,27,"I doubt there is much point in reporting it now since you have no way of even knowing who the guy is that you will report.

345022,johnnyb,2009-05-26 15:56:00,3413,Definitely worth calling his bluff..but hard to think calmly in a situation like that.  Sounds like a nutjob that needs to have his reality adjusted by the law.  Sorry to hear it.
345024,wuchikubo,2009-05-26 15:58:00,1114,"Thanks everyone, I've instructed my friend to report the incident. He's agreed to seek police advise and report the incident with details. He has had some hesitation and doesn't want to stir up trouble.  After further conversation with my friend, I've been told that a lady also came out in a canoe while the fellow held the anchor line uttering threat of cutting the anchor line. She also said that sunfish had a 3"" minimum size limit, but the fish caught were well larger than that but didn't even want to look at the fish just demanded all the fish be released. Then were told to go home and read up on the regulations. Apparently she had no idea of what kind fish were caught.  On the side the fellow also requested to see licenses, my friend presented proof of age over 65, the other friend then asked the fellow holding the boat for his ID to prove his identity and he said he had none with him. He refused to show him his fishing license.  My friend and colleague thanks everyone for their input and mentioned that all of the cottage owners but this one were very nice and polite to them as they went by and that the people at boat launch were equally nice. He doesn't want people to think Cameron Lake area have all bad people and to stop fishing there.  Hopefully this will allow both of my friends some peace of mind at night. Apparently they've been a bit shook up by the incident.  We'll see what response the police will have.  Thanks a bunch,  Stan"
345025,cram,2009-05-26 16:00:00,1733,"What's the point now?   It was argument.....the police have more important things to deal with.  Tell your friends that next time something like that happens to just offer to call the police then, while its happening.   The angry cottager will probably back off.  Also, why assume it was racially motivated?  The two younger caucasian anglers could have been their kids, or simply someone they knew."
345032,wuchikubo,2009-05-26 16:09:00,1114, My friend did see which cottage both (same cottage) the fellow and then the lady in the canoe went to when then left but the cottage doesn't have a number visible from the water.
345033,frozen-fire,2009-05-26 16:15:00,542," There have been attacks on asian anglers for the last couple years now. It has actually gotten pretty serious.  If I were in the situation, I would assume it to be racially motivated as well. The two complaining clearly have no idea of regulations. They saw a couple of asian people fishing and keeping some fish, they then row over and make up rules on size regulations and whatnot...and also utter threats? What's the point? The point is that no one should experience what those two innocent anglers did. Especially a senior. What if thing went out of hand? I feel really bad that the victims are still shaken up by the incident."
345034,fishnsled,2009-05-26 16:29:00,3520,Something similar like this came up a few years ago.

If it happens again and someone lese reports it and then again and again, it can't be ignored. If everyone fluffs it off , nothing will definitely happen.  2. If it was me, i'd be takining a ton of pictures with a camera/cell phone. Pictures speak louder than words. Then charge him with assault, harrassment and whatever else I could get to stick. 3. I'd be putting his paddle into a body cavity that he would need to have  sugurically removed. Just kidding but it was a nice thought. I like 'perodimi' and his idea too.

You should try to convince your friends to go back out there armed with cell phones and a camera, preferably with video and sound!!!  I know your friends don't want to cause trouble, but that idiot needs to be taught a lesson and prosecuted for his actions!  It would be the law abiding citizen thing to do... and I'm sure the local police and courts would be very interested in this case.  I also believe the media (newspaper and TV) would be interested too!"
