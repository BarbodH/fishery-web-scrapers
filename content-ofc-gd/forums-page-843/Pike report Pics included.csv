344757,Devious,2009-05-25 23:06:00,49,Whats up fellas...used to be a member here but haven't posted in a while....Been having some success this week fishing for pike so I thought id share a report with everyone here.  These fish were all caught over the past two days (Kingston area).  First day my buddy jesse and I went out and caught quite a few fish and ended up keeping these two which were just over 5lbs    Today I went out with my buddy kyle and fishing was relatively slow until I hooked into this dandy.....I look half retarded in the first pic haha..       9.11 lbs and I can assure everyone that this one was released    Chochi pissed he was napping when I got the big one  hahahah  Thats it for now but ill try and post more reports in the future.
