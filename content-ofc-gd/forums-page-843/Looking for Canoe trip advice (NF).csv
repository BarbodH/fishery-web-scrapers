I've heard about the Mississipi river/watershed from a couple of outdoorsy people and decided I may give it a go.  I haven't done much research yet, so I'm starting here, does any one know this route and things I should watch out for?  hard to find portages?  difficult ones?  tough rapids? damns? treacherous swamps? or even nice sights not far off the path?  Any advice would be really appreciated.  -Andre"
