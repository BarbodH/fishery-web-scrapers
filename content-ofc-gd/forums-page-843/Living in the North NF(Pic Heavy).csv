Last Monday one of the other teachers and I hiked up a mountain not far out of town.  Here is some scenery for you...      Found these tracks along the way and can't figure out what they are... any ideas?    Same tracks, for some reason there was 1 small section with these odd lines.    Close Up..    Shortly after we saw this guy... could they be his??    A while later we came across these as well.  I know what they are, but can you figure out which elusive animal they belong too?    Yesterday we headed out to scout out some fishing spots for the upcoming salmon run.  Decided along the way to hike part way down the Grand Canyon of the Stikine.  More scenery for you...        While eating lunch we spotted this white spot across the canyon...    so we zoomed in, and saw what we thought was a nice sized Billy...    After waiving our arms and shouting it finally stood up for a pose.  Turns out what we thought was a Billy was actually a Nanny with a small Kid, probably less than a couple weeks old.    After a while they decided to amble on...    Ended up driving a lot further than we expected and made it too the small town of Glenora where we found this nice beach.  Glenora is famous for its small population of hippies that lived here during the draft dodging days.  Met up with a fellow from Dease Lake who took us on a jet boat ride to check his salmon nets but unfortunately they were empty.    This morning I got a call from another fellow teacher.  He told me a truck had gone over and to get there quick.  Turns out the semi was filled with frozen Sockeye salmon on its way South from Alaska.  The driver swerved to avoid a car and ended up on his side.  Fortunately no one was hurt, but something had to happen with the salmon.  If it was left it would have gone bad, and given our remote location getting another truck there just wasn't feasible.  So the whole town was out emptying this truck.  People were leaving with pickups filled.   Ended up with 8 full sized frozen Sockeye.    -Andre"

344510,kickingfrog,2009-05-24 23:24:00,8333,"I hate trying to id tracks from photos, but I'll say yes, the first ones were a porcupine. Did they look pigeoned toed?  Or a wolverine with a set of antlers tied to his back."
344513,ozaibak1,2009-05-24 23:36:00,401,"Wow, great report and amazing pictures, thanks for taking the time to put it up, its HIGHLY appreciated! I especially like the pictures of the Billy Goats, I've watched a few documentaries about them and find them to be quite amazing."

344587,Zubris21,2009-05-25 03:06:00,563,"  I was wondering the same thing... or if it was a bird that decided to spread its wings for a bit.  Couldn't tell if the first tracks were pigeoned towed or not, could not see any definite foot prints, it was more like a shuffle.  The second set is indeed a wolverine  great work!"
