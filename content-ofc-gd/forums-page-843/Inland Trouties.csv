344972,blaque,2009-05-26 14:33:00,2419,"Some may have read my ""inland browns"" report from a week or so ago.......where me and the nephew were seekin out little inland browns..........as that day ended, we saw some bigger fish (bigger for inland trout anyway) and couldnt get a sniff outta them. Well i went back this weekend and found them willing to not only sniff..... but literally attack, unfortunately my nephew couldnt make it this time. Just as unfortunate.........i didnt bring the camera and had to rely on what i hate most.........a cell phone camera lol..........and even MORE unfortunate........i relaized i had the camera set to black and white on the brown pic. Anyway, heres a couple marginal pics of two of the bigger ""handfuls"" yesterday.........  This guy picked me up 3 drifts in a row before i finally got a hookset on him lol    And this lunatic came out from under a downed tree and did his best impression of a flying fish as he jumped eye level with me "
344977,MJL,2009-05-26 14:39:00,2427,"The pics turned out great. The black & white has a nostalgic look to it.  Beauty fish!  Like you, I didn't know rainbows could jump eye-level till one of them almost took my head off this spring"
344981,blaque,2009-05-26 14:49:00,2419,"lol, yeah he def. would have taken an eye out if he was on my side of the stream"
344993,Banger68,2009-05-26 14:58:00,157,Beautiful fish!  What were you using? Drifting worms?
345001,blaque,2009-05-26 15:10:00,2419,"used many presentations, from bead head nymphs.......to san juan worms....to pink worms."
345336,Leecher,2009-05-27 12:51:00,7832,They are certainly bigger than the ones you caught last week.... love the black & white pic Great job Blaque and thanks for sharing Leechman
345352,wuchikubo,2009-05-27 13:30:00,1114,"Although colors are nice, that first pic in black and white would look good printed in a scrapbook"
345387,limeyangler,2009-05-27 14:28:00,5204,"Thats preety cool to have seen them the week before hach a plan to get them another day, and watch a plan come together, gotta love it when that happens.  Good job on some really nice fish."
345405,blaque,2009-05-27 15:09:00,2419,"Thanks........this will probably be my last ""creek sneakin"" outing as the boat will finally be ready hopefully this weekend. So long to the streams till fall."
