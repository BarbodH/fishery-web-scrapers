344419,Roy,2009-05-24 13:21:00,13728,"J and I had the pleasure of having Big Cliff, John, his wife Barbara and Marc Thorpe  over for the evening yesterday. What a great time with great stories and hugs all around. It's Sunday morning and they're out on the water as I write this. I hope they do well again today.  These are four very generous and hospitable people. It's so nice to know that this board can make it possible to meet and make such great friends as these guys.  We should get a nice report when they get back home. OH, and Cliff (CCMT) I was on the phone with Big Cliff a couple of minutes ago from the boat and told him that you went to visit Sue. Told him of the super pic of Sue and Sydney that you posted...I'm sure he'll enjoy it as I did. He had to hang up...fish on!"
