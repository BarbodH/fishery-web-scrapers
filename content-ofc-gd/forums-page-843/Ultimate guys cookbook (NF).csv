I made a very strong suggestion on what Dad would like for Fathers day  just a couple of pages to drool on  Cedar Planked dinner rolls Planked sirloin burgers with blue cheese Smokin beer planked St Louis Ribs Cedar planked sweel potatoes w/ bacon, beer nuts and flaming marshmallows Planked chocolate chip cookies"
