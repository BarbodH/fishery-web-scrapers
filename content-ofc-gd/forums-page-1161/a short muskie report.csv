105310,ccmtcanada,2007-08-20 01:07:00,7971,"Nice muskie!  At least you hooked into that one.  The waters looked a bit rough where you were...and you did look cold.  We went to the place you recommended, and caught a few small fish, but at least there was no skunk today.  Thanks for the tip by the way!  Next time we'll go there without the little one...we had to find places between the thick weeds for her to plunk a worm on a bobber down.  I'd have like to have fished the thick weeds a little more.  Oh well...still had a great day out there."

105371,jediangler,2007-08-20 04:21:00,1923,"Great pics. You do look like you're freezing in the second one. GCD's right though, August or not, gotta dress for it. At least in the kayak you can warm up by paddling."
