105461,Lummy,2007-08-20 16:49:00,1,New to board.  Doing a fly-in in 08 at Kabinakagami Lake in Ontario out of Wawa.  Just wondering if anyone knows much about the lake.  It is a big lake - 25 mi long. Staying at Pine Portage Lodge. Supposedly lots of walleye & nothern and great accomadations.  Any help would be appreciated.
105540,Garyv,2007-08-20 21:03:00,547,A fellow I know went there a few times in the mid to latter 90's and had a good time.  The Watson's have owned it for a long time and it seems to have repeat customers every year so they and the lake must be doing something right.  As far as accommodations you definitely won't be roughing it.

The fishing for both pike and walleye was spectacular. We were there for two weeks and I can honestly say that I have never since been on a fishing trip where I have seen more wildlife. My sister is 57 years old now and still talks about it. The hot patterns then were Dardevles and Williams for the pike and original floating Rapalas for walleye. :-)  Hope this helps. hahahahahaha."
105564,Zib,2007-08-20 22:16:00,369,I went there back in 2004. Had a great time & caught a ton of fish. We stayed at Pine Portage lodge as well. There were 12 of us in the group & we slayed the walleye. The food was really good & great service. Great staff too. We ran the place out of beer in 2 days.  They will give you a map of the lake when you get there. We mainly fished the central part of the lake. For walleye try the south side of Elmer's Island. There's about 4 or 5 other islands next to Elmer's that produce just as well. We caught a lot of walleye there & some pike. Caught most walleye there drifting a Lindy rig with a minnow on a plain hook. Jig/grubs worked well too.  For pike you should go north of Elmer’s Island. Look on your map & you will see a weed bed by Sandy’s Rock & No Fish Bay (there is fish in that bay). That weed bed produced a lot of 24 to 28 inch pike. Go north of there you will see Rapalla Island where you can catch some pike there as well. The best spot for pike that we found was just off the southern tip of the island that’s west of Rapalla Island. On the southern tip of that Island is a rock/weed hump that comes up to about 4 feet. It’s probably around 20 meters across & isn’t marked on the map.  If there’s a strong wind out of the west or east the mouth of Agamik Gap is really good for bigger walleye (5 to 7 Lbs). Fish the drop offs close to shore. The walleye ambush the bait fish by the current breaks. There’s a nice little bay off of Dick’s Point that we caught a bunch of pike up to 32”.  For Perch try the rock piles by Simon’s Bay.  For shore lunch be sure to do a broil one of the days because it’s awesome!  Be sure to post back of how you did. Be sure to take GOOD rain gear with you & extra shoes.
