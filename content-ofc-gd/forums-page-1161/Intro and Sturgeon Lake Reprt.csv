I just recently got back into fishing after being away from the sport for almost 10 years and I've fallen back in love with it again! This weekend I went up to Sturgeon Lake to a buddy's cottage and took the boat out for some fishing. After the cold front passed through Friday night I didn't think I would have any luck but the opposite was true. I was fishing where the rocks meet the weeds around Hawkers Bay and the smallmouth were hitting hard. My buddy was using live minnows and I was using white berklys power grubs on an eerie dearie. Must have caught about 10 nice size smallies within a couple of hours in the morning and got the same results when going in the evening. Wish I took some pics but I forgot my camera at home.  This is a very informative site and I'm looking forward to becoming part of your community and picking up some tips along the way.  Cheers"
