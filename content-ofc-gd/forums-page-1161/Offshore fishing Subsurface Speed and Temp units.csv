104681,Vanselena,2007-08-17 17:07:00,269,Would you use these units if they wern't priced so high?
104724,Guest gbfisher,2007-08-17 19:29:00,0,I'd definitely buy one before I would even consider a fish finder Now there's a new invention for ya Vans!!!!

104786,Handlebarz,2007-08-17 22:09:00,3790,what are they?
104787,Tacklebuster,2007-08-17 22:11:00,303,"no doubt, its the only reason I still dont have one, and why I still use my fishhawk.  I already have an invention, anyone want to buy it?"
104862,Vanselena,2007-08-18 01:45:00,269, They show the speed and temp at your cannonball
104863,fishdawg,2007-08-18 01:59:00,912,"a down speed & temp unit is to trolling what a flashers (Vexilar) is to icefishing - once you use one, you just cant fish without one again - i have afew friends how have them on their boats    very slick indeed  - its pretty high up on my wish list - auto inflate PFD's first tho....."
104881,Handlebarz,2007-08-18 02:45:00,3790,  OK I was not shure what you all were talking about I dont use riggers so am green to them all together
105423,Vanselena,2007-08-20 13:31:00,269,so far looks like everyone would want one
105429,tonyb,2007-08-20 14:01:00,1637,Until they realize they are $500...Vanselena.  Tony
105456,Squid,2007-08-20 16:19:00,1656,"Nah, don't need one if you know what you are doing."
105457,live2fish,2007-08-20 16:25:00,70,Squid you dont need one if you know what your doing? You can be the best fisherman in the lake but you still dont know what the underwater currents are doing and that can throw off your speed which leads to poorer results. There is also no way to tell the ideal temperature without one of these which can leave you guessing teh whole day. Some days you catch fish no matter what but on the days the currents are screwy or the fish are feeding in their temperature they help alot.   Bowen
