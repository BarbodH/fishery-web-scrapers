104228,supernaut,2007-08-16 10:29:00,46,"I need to top up my battery with water. Should I be putting in distilled or deminerlized water?  Where can I buy water for my battery, at the grocery store ?"
104229,Roy,2007-08-16 10:31:00,13728,I've always used regular tap water but you can boil the water first if it makes you feel better. Let it cool before putting it in the battery.
104233,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-16 11:03:00,4399,All the articles that I have read say use only distilled and yes you should be able to get it at the grocery store.
104234,rick1117,2007-08-16 11:20:00,2,Distilled water only...............so I have read
104235,Tacklebuster,2007-08-16 11:22:00,303,"every article as well as the battery care and maintenance manuals I have read indicates that you should only use distilled water, mainly becuase it doesn't have any minerals or other contaminants in it."
104239,BITEME,2007-08-16 11:37:00,1969,Tap water!!!!!!
104276,supernaut,2007-08-16 13:03:00,46,"Just got back from Loblaws, and they had 4L of distilled water for a $1.99 Thanks for your replys guys.. Woohoo!"
104407,addict,2007-08-16 19:13:00,475,i used tap water and my battery lasted for 5yrs
104415,misfish,2007-08-16 19:34:00,29133,"I use RO,since I can get it here for free at work.LOL"
104501,John Bacon,2007-08-17 02:20:00,3277,  Why would you want to boil the water?  I think that would be even worse than using water straight out of the tap because it would increase the mineral concentration due to water lost through evaporation.
104617,Tacklebuster,2007-08-17 14:30:00,303,"why would you boil the water, just buy a bottle of distilled water, right beside the spring water"
104940,BGis,2007-08-18 14:30:00,15,"Hi  whats ? RO . I here you can buy a conditioner for batteries, is that one of them. If it is can you send me a few gallons"
104966,Muskieman,2007-08-18 17:20:00,2472,"distilled water , with 2ml,of bleach diluted for every 100ml in your Distilled water[bottled steam] pre-mix a bottle and keep it in the shop..my batteries are 10  & 9 years old and still work like new. I read that in an old issue of In Fisherman Mag. alot of people here do it , works for me."
105097,PERCHER,2007-08-19 05:12:00,787,Tap water......
105204,nomadfisher,2007-08-19 19:28:00,20,"demineralized & distilled are pretty well the same thing.. just the process of getting to the end is different  demineralized usually passes though a set reverse osmosis filters to extract the minerals, while with distilled, there is a evaporation / condensation process.  actually to be precise, distilling is just one method of demineralization.  whether to use tap or demineralized is also debatable and somewhat of a judgement call... in the  ""good' old days, evaporation cycles in lead acid batteries were more severe and thus the buildup of minerals on the battery plates was more significant...under normal charge cycles with newer batteries, the mineral deposit becomes less significant and the battery life is limited by other factors.  kinda agree with johnbacon that boiling the water will just increase the mineral concentration.  interesting about the chlorine... never heard of that before... what does this achieve ??     .... nomad  ......"
105205,Burtess,2007-08-19 19:50:00,901," You are incorrect.  Boiling reduces temporary hardness (hardness caused by bicarbonate ions).  Roy was suggesting this to reduce the salt content of the water.  Deionized, distilled, or reverse osmosis water is preferred however.  Burt"
105376,John Bacon,2007-08-20 04:41:00,3277,"  Boiling the water to reduce temporary hardness will only work if you remove the precipitate that forms when it is boiled (preferably before it has cooled).  Even than, impurities other than calcium carbonate will have increased in concentration."
105476,misfish,2007-08-20 17:45:00,29133, reverse osmosis
105524,douG,2007-08-20 20:23:00,2693,"Ya.  Roy, what would boiling water do?  I think you do that if you want to drink it, not put it in your batteries.  As for adding bleach, wouldn't that tend to neutralize the acid electrolyte necessary for the battery to work?  I would stick with the distilled water, no worries."
105530,jedimaster,2007-08-20 20:33:00,3472,"Distilled water is captured steam. The steam is 100 percent pure H20. The junk left behind is all the calcium, salts etc... If you put boiled water in it all you have done is further concentrate the minerals. If your boiling your water your better off just dumping pure tap water in it. RO is Reverse Osmosis. I used to use that for my fish tank, RO is water that is forced through a filter at high preasure. This will also remove most of the junk similar to distilled but RO is not as clean as Distilled. Many people in the fish tank world consider RO as good as DI(Distilled). SOme of the more fanatical will use Distilled water and put it through an RO filter before filling there tanks with water. This is only common ammong saltwater fish folks. They then add minerals, salt etc...."
