105180,tbayboy,2007-08-19 16:55:00,1497,"Just a quick report this week.  After last weeks rental debacle PatrickG and I decided to try a new lake.  I was thinking Stony but kept hearing about Lovesick (next door) and I knew a cheaper boat rental on Lovesick so the decision was made.  We flew up there, in fact arrived before the owners were expecting us, so we setup our gear by the car.  Damn it was cold - we were parked in the shade and damn near froze setting everything up.  We met the owners of the place (Marricks landing) and got a little map and a tip on where to start for the bass.  Nice people and a fine boat (nothing fancy - 14'er with a 9.9 but no problems with it and no crazy sign your life away forms or anything like that).  Off we went into this smaller lake (didnt realize how small it was til I got there) and we found our way to the spot recommended by the owner and pretty quickly Patrick gets hit off a dock.  We'd like to call it the first of the day but...  The catch  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1227/1171504739_f801827b5b.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_1679"" /></a>  The lift including a wonderful last second mid air leap... <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1178/1172369906_569f2d7a4c.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_1680"" /></a>  That leads to ... the release  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1396/1172373940_692856df76.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_1681"" /></a>  Ah well it was a start and I quickly followed with a similar fish.  So a couple small guys pretty early, good start right? Yeah well it was a good start but also a finish of sorts.  Though we found loads of great structure with wonderful deep weed lines, weed patches, docks, pads, drop offs and other kinds of spots that we knew had to hold fish they were all taking a little break during the cold weather (at least thats the excuse we stuck with).  Even the wacky rigged worms didn't entice much more than the odd perch and rock bass.  Eventually we moved onto the other side of the lake and noticed lots of guys fishing in one spot that the map showed as being a big hole and judging from the style of fishing we saw the target was pretty obvious - jigging for 'eyes.  We weren't ready for walleye fishing yet so we worked the shoreline and I had a nice 2 fish in 4 casts moment, here's one of them:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/1171520439/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1336/1171520439_dea158a686_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1686"" /></a>  A bit later Patrick points out that we're drifting into a rock so I kick the engine into reverse and apparently this little guy had been watching Patrick's bait and the sudden jerk launched her into action, surprised the heck out of both of us:  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/1172397532/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1429/1172397532_6bdc4efaca_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1703"" /></a>  The same spinner bait soon caught what it was aimed at:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1235/1171536017_766f3552e8_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1704"" /></a>  I told Patrick it was my turn and flipped a my spinner under an old branch:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1261/1172400564_f3ed0a1c0d_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1705"" /></a>  Don't you love when you call them.  As you can tell from the pics the sizes were pretty small.  We didn't see a decent sized fish all day  Later in the day I tried jigging a bit and managed this monster:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1244/1171543627_58bb1f5618_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1706"" /></a>  Then we switched to trolling.  We worked all over the big hole that everyone else seemed to be working but I marked only a couple fish and though I had a couple taps there weren't any takers.  At least thats what I thought as a few minutes later I dragged in my line to clear some weeds and found a 3 inch bass hanging off the back hook of the harness.  No idea how long I'd been dragging the poor guy along but he seemed no worse for the experience as he leaped from my hand before I could get a picture of my HUGE trolling catch.  We started heading back to the docks and just outside the docks we saw a guy catch a smallie so turned off the motor and let the current take us the rest of the way while we tossed.  Sure enough, just a few feet from the return point Patrick gets the last of the day and tries his best to make it look big for the camera  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1305/1171507697_a4dfd41f38_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1707"" /></a>  I liked the lake overall.  It's a bit on the small side and I might prefer stony just for the variety but I can see why people like Lovesick (especially if you have a smaller boat like a canoe) and I'd like to think if the weather was better we'd have done well (or at least caught one or two fish with some size to them).  I'll definitely go back again sometime just to see if it was me or the weather that didn't perform well (probably a bit of both) so if anyone wants to head out there just let me know - I know a good rental place  Sean"
105187,MJL,2007-08-19 18:05:00,2427,Great report with some very nice pics.  Love the markings on that little muskie  WTG
105200,PatrickGG,2007-08-19 19:10:00,562,"Hey Sean the weather sure feels like it changed today i really wondered if today would have been a better day to be out on the water, Maybe we should arrange a day where we can get at least four of us up there since i got a van we can split up the gas costs get two boats and pair up and do a mini tourney making it a challenging day and one good of report.  P.S The true meaning of fear: Look at the rock bass and his eyes can say it all."
105241,Greencoachdog,2007-08-19 22:39:00,8163,"Great report and pics!!! Fell free to send some of that cool weather down here anytime between now and the end of September, after that... you can keep it to yourselves!"
105242,bbog,2007-08-19 22:48:00,665,"Nice report and pics, I'll have to take my canoe up and give Lovesick Lake a shot."
105260,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-19 23:42:00,0,Thanks for the report. Small fish is better than no fish!We were actually thinking of trying Lovestick this weekend but changed our mind. There are some decent musky in there I hear.
105292,Joey,2007-08-20 00:24:00,9122,Great report and pictures.  Some half decent fish there.  I'm sure it was the weather  How do you get your pictures to post on here when they're that big     I always have to minimize mine to a size that takes away from the beauty of them.  Joey
105293,ccmtcanada,2007-08-20 00:25:00,7971,Great report Sean!  Bly and I were looking in a book we have about this lake and wondered about it.  Your comment about canoes makes me think we'll try it out this year.  Great pics and story as usual!
105323,tbayboy,2007-08-20 01:26:00,1497,"I think you'd like it Cliff - with a little trolling motor you can get into just about anywhere (I'd just be careful around the main channel from the buckhorn to stoney locks as some guys fly through there.  Joey: I host my pics on flickr which takes full size pics and then I just link them in (vs uploading the pics to the site directly).  In fact you can click on any of mine to see the whole gallery and the original sizes and what not, if you want some more details just drop me a pm."
