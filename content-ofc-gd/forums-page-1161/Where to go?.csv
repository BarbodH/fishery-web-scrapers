105240,kuhaman,2007-08-19 22:32:00,503,I'm sure this question has been asked a billion times before but I'm gonna ask anyway. I'm looking for a spot within 5 to 6 hours from St.Catharines where I can rent a cottage and boat for a weekend in September. I've been searching the web for a spot I can catch some pickeral and the choices are just overwhelming! Any suggestions?

It's a fly-in outpost thru Lakeland Airways.  They have 4 lakes you can fly into but I've only been to Aston Lake.  It's a fairly small lake but your cabin is the only one on it.  I actually like that the lake isn't huge because you get to know things the lake quickly.  Anyways, the rates are great.  Only $550 per person for a week.  The cabin is by no means luxury but it does the trick.  If you're  interested in seeing some pics let me know and I'll post some up."
