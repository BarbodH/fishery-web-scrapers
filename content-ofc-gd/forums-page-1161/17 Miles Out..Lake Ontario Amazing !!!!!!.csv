105329,caper,2007-08-20 01:37:00,210,"that's awesome, thanks for the report. I was out today out of Whitby and got skunked but from the chatter on the radio it seemed guys were doing ok aout in very deep water. I might have to venture out there in my small boat this week if we can get some very calm days!!  Good luck the rest of the week. I can't seem to get anything of any size to get anwhere near the board.  Craig"

105407,solopaddler,2007-08-20 11:50:00,8605,"24 for 30? That's amazing, what an incredible day!"
105408,ilario,2007-08-20 12:01:00,166,  the big spawners wouldn;t be out that far... i used to fish out there too years ago..always dependable and lots of cooperative rainbows and coho..but the big chinooks were not usually caught out that far - and this is evident by his excellent catch which is most coho/bows  the cohos spawn later too...  I remember having rainbows follow my spoons right to the boat a I retrieved my lures to reset lines...they're fearless out there...i guess they don;t get much attention out in that deep water!!
