I obviously would be interested but I had to get clearance from my wife. A quick call and I find out that she will be going to a friend's place for a bbq, she gives me the okay to go!  I finished work at 4:30pm on Sat, get home at around 5pm (I've been walking to work this month when it's nice out). A quick change of clothes (figured showing up in a shirt and tie would look ridiculous). Quickly grab a few rods (5 to be exact), I probably only needed to take two and got into the car to head to the fishing spot.  About 40 mins later, I arrive at the spot, my fishing friend and her family have already been fishing for the past 2 hours and landed 8 trout (6 of them). Now since I've been to this spot before, I went back to the lures that worked before, but this time only light taps on the line. My friend and her family were using live worms on a float. After about an hour of fishing with only a couple more landed fish by her family, they decide that it was time to pack up and take a couple of fish to the restaurant for preparation and dinner.  I passed on the dinner invite as I hadn't landed a fish yet. Determined to land a decent fish without live bait I start changing my set up every 10-15 mins. It was about 8 pm when I was getting frustrated with no hook ups. Make the decision, one final change of lures and if I didn't hook anything I'd go home.  Put on a blue and silver reef runner (this one was new and hadn't ever had a fish on it yet) and casted it out, reeled in about 6 ft and then BAM, fish on! A nice little rainbow about 15"" with roe spewing out. Unhooked and put into a container (this one is dinner!).  Casted the lure again, BAM within 8 feet of where I was standing. This time a very pretty looking natural speck about 13"" (sorry no pics). Unhook the fish and then notice my bail on my Daiwa Regal Spinning reel had come apart and pieces must have fallen into the water   .  I say to myself, okay this must be the sign for me to pack up, so I did.  Got home at about 9:10pm, fillet the fish, breaded and panfried. Fresh fish always tastes good to me.  Now I have to wait until next Sunday to fish again.  Thanks for reading.  Stan"
