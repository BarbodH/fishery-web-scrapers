Rinse fish  Mix a brine using 1 ltr of Teriaki sauce, 500ml of soya sauce, 2 cups of packed brown sugar, 1 cup of honey, 1 squeezed large lemon, a bunch of bruised basil. Put fish (I used about 30lbs) into freezer bags and pour mixture in, then burp the bags and seal and put into the fridge for 48 hours.  Place on smoker trays right from the brine and let air dry then place in the smoker.  I smoke 2 pans of chips until the fish is done.  "
