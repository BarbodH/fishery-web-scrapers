105172,boatman,2007-08-19 15:37:00,350,That's a heck of an offer. Good for you. That's a lot of extra work you are taking on!  I do a lot of tinkering with small engines and outboards as well. If you don't mind I may drop you a PM for some advice if I ever come across a problem I can't figure out.  Good luck with the new career/hobby.

105175,boatman,2007-08-19 15:50:00,350,I might take you up on that Big Cliff. I go up to Lindsay every month or two to see a friend and go fishing.
105178,Jen,2007-08-19 16:28:00,833,"Wonderful offer Cliff,  If anyone from Hamilton is running up your way and are willing to take something for me I have a Small Generator sitting in my garage that I broke the pull start off of.  Can't seem to find the parts anywhere.  Would love for you to have a look at it!  Cheers  Jen"
