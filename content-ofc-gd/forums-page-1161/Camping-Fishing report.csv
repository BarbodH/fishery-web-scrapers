104839,Spiel,2007-08-18 00:56:00,9065,"....Now that I'm finally able to view the board I'll give yous a small report of the camping/fishing trip[ the kids and I took a few weeks ago.  We left on a Monday morning to a near north adventure where I've been taking the kids since they were in diapers. It's a small lake but it has a decent warm water fishery though I'd only get a few mornings to test my rusty talents. Anyway I'll keep it short.   The campsite.   The docks. Which is where my boy spent a great deal of time harrassing the local panfish population. The docks is also where I met Karl Kolanka (Extreme Angler) on the first morning I got out for a quiet (solo) fishing adventure. Nice guy that Karl, we traded tales about fishing the lake from past adventures and I filled him in my mornings success.   I'm willing to venture that Karl's boat may be a tad quicker than mine.  My success was limited to a handful of smallmouth bass which I found interesting since I was targeting largemouth. The area I was fishing was 2 to 3 feet deep and thick with weeds. Surface temp was 82.5 and deep water was a few hundred yards away. The sun had already been up for near two hours but I wanted to toss top water baits in an effort to avoid the heavy weeds. It was a good choice as the smallies were on the bait often before the splash subsided. Here's a couple of the better ones.   The big'n was 19x13, what a fatty! Yes they were all released.  The afternoons were spent boating and swimming in order to quell the stifling heat, man it was a hot week.        On the second morning I awoke early to a very bright moon. It was just past 4:30 and I was on the water before 5. This time I couldn't find a smallie? I did however manage a dozen or so largemouth. Most were running an nice 2 to 3lbs. But is was the 2 that broke me off that left me shaking. I'd guess both to be over 7lbs. I had a good look at both only 20 feet from the boat when they busted my Chug Bug. The first one actually came back out of the water after I broke him off in the weeds, shook his head and sent my lure flying about 10 feet away. Thanks!   The moon   and the bass.  My boy who continued day in and out harassing the dock fish also managed a nice bass.    I also got my son tossing some top water on our last evening and he got his first surface busting bass. However he didn't think it would be to flattering to take his picture with a 6 inch fish after his prize dock bass....lol        Well that's it for now. Another adventure is just around the corner for the kids and I. Should be a blast!"
