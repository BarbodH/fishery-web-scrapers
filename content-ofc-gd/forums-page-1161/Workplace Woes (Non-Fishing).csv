105670,Dutch,2007-08-21 02:23:00,831,"Take a listen to Headhunter's advice.  From a bosses standpoint, which I am (but I would never do what he did), you need to heal things over.  He isn't going to come to you probably, so you need to hatch things out with him.  Let him know where you were coming from and tell him you just didn't understand his point of view.  Hopefully he will elaborate.  You may want to say you know it was wrong to go to the pres. (even if you don't believe it).  He will probably say he was wrong to deny your early leave.  This is a give-give type of talk.  Hopefully the boss will take the bait.  We probably spend as much time with our co-workers as we do with our families.  Work is not a place for personal problems to get in the way.  You and your boss should realize that and bury the hatchet.  As a boss once told me - in a struggle between bosses and their direct reports, the boss will always win, we are management for a reason - may be mean spirited, but it is true and should be taken with a grain of salt."
105722,Clampet,2007-08-21 10:59:00,1947," If I were the boss, I would praise my workers for work well done, and encourage them to share ideas for improvement.  Too many bosses only speak to you when there is an issue, always finding fault, never praising one for their jobs that are well done.  They are not true leaders, and no one respects them.  A worker will bend over backwards to please a boss they respect, but will do the bare minimum when his back is turned to the boss that is a task master. "
105247,holdfast,2007-08-19 23:01:00,1813,"First of all, I would of done the same thing.  If you don't get satisfaction go up to the next chain of command.  Good thing they don't think the same.  As far as your boss is concerned he certainly needs to hone up on his man-management skills.  I bet you now he may realize how stupid you made him look for making a bad decision.  Health and safety should always be a priority.  Yup a bad decision.  Now for some facts, unfortunately  Too many people take advantage of I'm sick or I have a family emergency.  A smart manager will know who is a malingerer and a waste of rations.  But unfortunately it has hurt persons that will only take time off when they are in dire straits.  Next time get a doctors poop to cover your hillbilly A$@#%##$"

105473,Headhunter,2007-08-20 17:30:00,5703,"If your company has a H.R. department, that should have been you first stop. HR is trained to deal with these things and will go to bat for you, assuming you are a valued employee. If you have a history of ""tummy aches"" well, you've cried wolf too many times. Again, assuming you have an HR department, I'd let them know what has transpired, to ensure that it's all properly documented by them... so you've covered your behind for the future. As for your current manager, I'd sit him/her down once your back to 100% and ask him what he thinks you could have done differently, in order for him/her to understand your situation more clearly. Should that discussion not net you any results, again consider talking to HR and or you manger's boss. PS... it never hurts to have your resume up to date!LOL HH"

105539,aplumma,2007-08-20 21:02:00,6896,Without back round how can you all call his boss an A hole. He really may be an A hole but it is only one side of the story we see. Most employees won't cut themselves to get off of work but a few have taken sick days because their company takes them away if they are not used. The bosses reasons could be that a certain deadline had to be met ....An example is my wife had a deadline that unmet would cost the company 2.3 million dollar so she worked Sat and Sunday with 4 others to get it done. While the boss should not of said he could not go he should have required a doctors note that explained the ailment so he could justify any overtime the other employees had to spend catching up the days labor. I agree with HeadHunter that you should document the incident since the Boss did not ask for a note.Rest assured getting into a peeing contest or aggrivating the boss by going over his head will not help you climb the ladder to sucess. Next time you have a disagreement after you have talked to the boss then schedule an appointment with him and request a joint meeting with him and his supervisor if you feel he is in the wrong. You did win the battle and got home to help you feel better it is best not to turn this into a war.......unless you are looking for a new job.  Art
