105125,vanillagorilla,2007-08-19 12:43:00,46,It was pretty slow off the drop at Bluffers on Saturday morning so with the advise of Riley Salmon (Chris Currie) we went out to 300+ FOW.  The action was much better.  We went 8 for 8 with one 18 pound king and the balance being made up of Coho & Steelhead.  Paul Bordo with a 13 pound Steelhead that came off the Wire with a Spindoctor & Fly    Paul with a 12 pound Coho that came off the Riggers with Flasher & Meat    Thanks for the heads up Chris!!!!

105155,ilario,2007-08-19 14:35:00,166,gorgeous coho... they are such nice fish and they fight amazingly... I used to catch tonsd when I'd head out to the blue zone off bluffers.. a dozen in 2 or 3 hours wwasn;t uncomommon... I find they're more cooperative than chinooks..i wish there was more stocking of coho. Most today are either natural or NY fish... i guess the natural stock is a good thing..
