104679,Vanselena,2007-08-17 17:02:00,269,Would you use these units if they wern't priced so high?
104701,Uncle Buck,2007-08-17 17:49:00,1000,"are you talking about the downspeed and temp units like the fish hawks/subtrolls/depth raiders??  If so definitely, once the boat is done, that is one of the items on the must buy list...  when fishing with one you'd be surprised at the difference in surface speed compared to the down speed"
104704,Vanselena,2007-08-17 17:54:00,269,Yes that is exactly what I am talking about...  Thanks
104719,tonyb,2007-08-17 19:03:00,1637,I've talked to some of the 'pro' salmon guys that fish Lake Ontario and the common theme is they would rather be without a Sonar before losing their down speed and temp.  Tony
104835,fishindevil,2007-08-18 00:42:00,6254,"Tony you are right i have a FISHAWK 840 THERMOL TROLL,  and yes its a mandatory peice of equipment to have ,and yes there is sometimes a huge differnce in your speed at the probe and the surface speed,as well as the down temp,its a great unit and for the great lakes as well as for lake trout,anywhere fish will suspend,or follow bait to their prefered temperature,its a must have......it ups your catch ratio big time.....if you are seriuos about fishing for anything other than bass, you must have one......cheers"
104838,Roy,2007-08-18 00:55:00,13728,"I agree that  those units are good. But Van, weren't you building a super sonar unit last year? How did that work out?"
104858,Vanselena,2007-08-18 01:43:00,269,Still working on the sonar unit. I am thinking about adding this onto the unit as it wouldn't be that difficult and would likely be a $100 option.
