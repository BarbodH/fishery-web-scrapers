105481,Anatz,2007-08-20 18:03:00,74,"I went fishing @ Little Lake, Barrie and I finally got to use my Berkley Power Honey Worms and I caught around 50 pan fishes which included sunfishes and perches within 30 minutes. This bait is worth the money and you don't have to change the bait. I never had to replace the honey worms and I think you could probably reuse it again in the future by putting it back into the jar. This beats worms. And also I caught 1 LM, but it was a small guy =]"
105485,pikehunter,2007-08-20 18:10:00,1659,"From your report I would say that it works!  Haven't tried it yet, saw it on the shelf at Trombly's in orillia last week and thought it was rather pricey since I haven't really read a report about it. I think the price was around 19 bucks? for the small and 50 for the large bucket? If it works then it's worth it!"

105497,wallyboss,2007-08-20 18:47:00,1095,"Pikehunter , these are not the expensive ones.  Anatz they're incredible for Panfish thru the ice also.  I won't leave home without them when heading out for crappies."
105500,bassmaster4,2007-08-20 18:57:00,801,do you have to move them around somehow or do you chuck em out with a bobber or something
105505,wallyboss,2007-08-20 19:13:00,1095,I've used them on jigs and i've used them under floats.
105522,canadianguy33,2007-08-20 20:17:00,121,"I haven't used this exact type of powerbait, but I've found success with nearly all of the powerbaits I've used and I use them quite a lot over the years.  Personally, I like the Berkley Gulp baits better because they're more like live bait and the fish can actually eat them. If I were trying to catch pan fish I'd use the 6"" pumpkinseed nightcrawlers and cut them into thirds.  Also, sometimes I'll save the baits if I've only used them for a couple of hours, but I never put them back in the bag/jar with the new ones.  Even though I don't think panfish are particularly sensitive to smell, I just don't like the idea of possibly contaminating the new baits."
105693,Anatz,2007-08-21 03:27:00,74,thats true...lucky I didn't put it back. I used a float with it.
105727,pikehunter,2007-08-21 11:24:00,1659," Oh yeah....  Now that I have taken a second look at the picture I see that this is not the product I was thinking of.   My mistake, thanks for pointing that out.  Glad the honey worms and grubs worked for you Anatz."
