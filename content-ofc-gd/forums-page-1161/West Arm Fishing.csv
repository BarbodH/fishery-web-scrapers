The weather was interesting, we got hailed on twice, a couple of freaky summer storms, overall it was cool, fresh, and nice. No musky this year tho, not even a follow-up…we cast and troll with bucktail spinners and plugs daily with no avail  :dunno:  . Robyn trolling…  On the other hand, the bass fishing was just fantastic…lots of fish in the covers, we caught many bass and few of them were in 3-4# range.  texased worms and the spinnerbait worked   The orange/black spinnerbait produced a few of the usual suspects on the West Arm this year…  …and a few slot eyes…tried out the celphone camera…didn’t turn out too nice  followed the rainbows home…celphone picture…not too good…  We had a great time!  Be back again next year…  :thumbsup_anim:"
