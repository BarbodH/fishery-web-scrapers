105525,Green,2007-08-20 20:26:00,20,"Want to take the family camping for this long weekend. Are there any campsites at Silent Lake that you have to canoe to? We are looking for a campsite to ourselves, hence the canoeing. If not do any of you know a good place to camp where you canoe out to your own site and has decent fishing?  Tks"
105528,douG,2007-08-20 20:32:00,2693,"Give 'em a call at Silent Lake PP at 613-339-2807.  If you are looking for remote camping, try Algonquin Park.  Here is a message board all about Algonquin.  There are lots of trip reports there for your enjoyment. Especially look for reports from Marcus and Salvelinus.  Barbara hangs out there too."
105531,jedimaster,2007-08-20 20:35:00,3472,"No, not in Silent Lak PP, they are all drive up camping. Go to Algonquin instead if you want to canoe to a campsite. If you want good fishing you'll have to make one or two portages. Tea Lake is an easy portage."
105532,Green,2007-08-20 20:44:00,20,Thanks for the phone number doug. I called them and they do not have a secluded site. I took the family to Algonquin a couple years ago and was hoping for a change of scenery.  Will keep looking to see where I can find another site.  Tks
105543,tbayboy,2007-08-20 21:06:00,1497,Bon Echo park has some canoe in sites as well.  I haven't been there personally but wanted to try it for just that reason.  I'm sure some of the guys on the board can point out some more details on Bon Echo if you're interested.
105546,Green,2007-08-20 21:14:00,20,Did some net searching and found a place where you can canoe out to your own site. It is called Long Lake which is just north of the Kawarthas. Looks decent. Lets hope the fishing is good too. Tks to all for your help.
105559,kennyman,2007-08-20 22:10:00,737,Murphy's Point is a really nice PP and has canoe in sites as well.
105580,douG,2007-08-20 23:21:00,2693,"There are many lakes you can access from Long Lake.  The trip to StopLog Lake has a portage that takes you by a beautiful waterfall, and  has a great cliff for jumping / swimming.  That was a trip I did 38 years ago."
