105215,Terry,2007-08-19 20:49:00,14456,"well another year has come and gone...I base my years on my fishing trips to bay wolf camp shiningtree, so I have to wait another year to go again   it was a tough year for fishing conditions couldn't be worst at times it was hard to get a bite, but when the fish turned on we did pretty well I played with the underwater camera and it worked well turns out there are lots of old logs on all the humps we fish  I did 3 ATV trips to back lakes  and that's always a blast, I did tip over the atv and broke the bracket that holds the folding boat, my buddy I had with me is over 65 and he survived the fall, so all is well and he trusted me to go on it again the next day  One morning I went down to the boat and noticed all my minnows were gone…thought maybe the door didn’t close right…yeah  Got more minnows  and went fishing Back for dinner and ready to go again  pulled the minnow bucket  out of the water and it felt real heavy I started to open the lid and something was looking out at me… I jumped like a school girl and trough the bucket back in the water. the guy with me thought I was nuts I took the paddle and pushed the minnow buckets lid open and a mink/weasel or what ever it was jumps out and swims off..I whacked the water beside him as he was swimming away and he never came back the rest of the week but he was well fed that day Saw some big cat tracks and wolf tracks and moose tracks but didn’t see any animals this year  But even with the wind all week the rain and the cold weather we had a good time                 now back to work on Monday.........................................crap"

105220,Carp,2007-08-19 21:03:00,1488,"Too bad the fishing wasn't what was expected, but it's always better than sitting around the house.  Wish I was where you were."
