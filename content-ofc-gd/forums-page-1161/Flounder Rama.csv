105571,ecxstriper,2007-08-20 22:56:00,343,"I finally got out to do some salt water fishing. Went out on a head boat ( a large boat that can take up to 50 people). Day was overcast but really nice no wide or sunburn,. I ended up with some keeper, one blue fish(snapper blue size and several Sea robins which have an armored head . "

105579,Roy,2007-08-20 23:18:00,13728,"Great report, Alex. Flounder....such a great eating fish! Glad you had a good time. Hope you and Ric can hook up."
105589,ecxstriper,2007-08-20 23:50:00,343,I'm a New York subway sized surf rat . I would be more than happy to hook up with you for some fishing .
105596,Greencoachdog,2007-08-20 23:57:00,8163,Beautiful Flatfish!!! That Blue fish will cook up nicely too! I hate those bait stealing Sea Robins!!!  Thanks for posting!
105603,ilario,2007-08-21 00:05:00,166,i fnd it interesting that we have quite a few members here from outside of Ontario...especially U.S.  those flounder are probably good eating..!!  enjoy!
105604,Gerritt,2007-08-21 00:06:00,6129,I watch a cool documentary on Flounders... how they start off life with eyes on both sides of there head... the eye eventually migrates as the hug bottom more and more... pretty unique! Ohhh and that robin thing... looks like me after a good night at the local watering hole.... scary!   Gerritt.
105605,Bly,2007-08-21 00:09:00,1556,Nice fish Alex!  Looks like a nice dinner for you and the cats!  lol
105629,ecxstriper,2007-08-21 00:53:00,343, The cool thing is we have left side flounder called summer flounder and right sided flounder called winter flounder  
105645,Daplumma,2007-08-21 01:32:00,1961,"I think them US guys should find their own fishing group!Nice flatfish there,some of the best eatin fish around.Didn't know that there were winter and summer flounders.I can remember as a kid gigging flounder and collecting softshells at night in Bay St Louis Mississippi."
105647,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 01:36:00,7971,WHat??  Wait a minute...is this an actual fishing report with fish in it?? LOL.  Great job out there bro in law!  Those are some pretty strange looking fish (at least to me).  Great to see you getting out there.  Cant wait to see your next report.
105702,ecxstriper,2007-08-21 04:37:00,343,That would be because I didn't go fishing with you !!!
