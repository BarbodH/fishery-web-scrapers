105416,Mike the Pike,2007-08-20 13:16:00,3421,Got out yesterday on the Richelieu River launched in a town called Sabrevois 10 Miles from the US border.Felt good to be back in the comfort and safety of my 18 foot Lund after flipping my 12ft tinny on vacation. Decided to go out with a coworker of mine and he brought his son and I brought my fishfinder my son Ryan. Here are some pics.   Double header of Perch.They were hungry Sunday.   Ryan doing what he loves.     Julien who is ten caught his 2nd fish of his life took him awhile but the boy was happy.   This is what I came for there are plenty of Pike on the Richelieu River. The boys actually saw 2 pike checking out their jigs beside the boat.        Gerard far back my son Ryan on the left and Julien on the right.   Ryan caught some crayfish while we took the boat out of the water.   Stopped of at a farm to pick up some vegetables while the boys enjoyed the animals.  A great few hours on the water between father's and son's.  Mike the Pike

105424,Roy,2007-08-20 13:34:00,13728,WTG Mike and boys. I haven't been to that area in a few years. I used to launch at Noyan. Thanks for the report.
105442,bbog,2007-08-20 15:20:00,665,"Nice father/son report MTP, and a bonus that you got into some fish."
105459,Greencoachdog,2007-08-20 16:30:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics there Flipper!!!! Those Shellcrackers (Redear Sunfish) are pretty good size! I also like the over-and-under grip on that Pike, I sometimes use that manuver myself."
105460,Roy,2007-08-20 16:48:00,13728,"That's sometimes referred to as the ""undecided' hold."
105467,fatherof3,2007-08-20 17:03:00,1769,great father/son report.those are the best times
105633,Greencoachdog,2007-08-21 01:00:00,8163," I prefer to call it the "" you can't bite me now you little bugger"" hold."
105638,solopaddler,2007-08-21 01:15:00,8605,"Great report Mike, that's some happy looking kids there  ."
105639,Mike the Pike,2007-08-21 01:15:00,3421,Glen.  I no longer hold pike through the gill plate inside the mouth near its tongue.I have been cut too many times by those toothy critters so the small ones are held like that and the bigs ones get held with a glove.I am a woose when it comes to pike.So be it no more cuts for me.I now prefer the 2 hand slime hold.

105646,Gerritt,2007-08-21 01:36:00,6129,Mike... I dont know why the pics are not working... but thank you for the report... I look forward to your reports whenever I hear you are out fishing!... I have to make it up to Quebec sometime next year... I have friends that fish in Val d'or (sp?) and they tell me the fishing is amazing!... care to show a useless non french speaking guy  around for a few days? lodging is on me.. perhaps we can get our families involved? I have a young son that @ the age of two is very interested in fishing... seems like we could have a great couple of days!  Thanks again for sharing..  Gerritt.
