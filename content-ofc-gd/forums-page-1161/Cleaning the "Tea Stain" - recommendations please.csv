But - when I pulled the boat out, it had the notorious Tea Stain - tried the following  Goo Gone White Mr Clean Eraser Crud Killer Water Soap  What works to get this cleaned off??  Any one who knows what works best??  Thanks  Greg  Going to post my report this week with pics - fishing was slow but we got a few"
105207,PERCHER,2007-08-19 20:04:00,787,Javex Bleach and water.Spray it on and let it sit about 2 minutes and then wash it off.Works great.I pour it in the hull of my boat mixed with water and leave it in while i go fishing for the day and when I get home I pull the plug and rinse it all out.It leaves the inside of the hull looking like new.No more slime.

105237,marvin,2007-08-19 22:07:00,37,"Go to Canadian Tire or Walmart and buy spray nine cleaner. Spray it on and leave it for a while. Will remove any stain, road grime but do not spray on carpet."

105401,Blake,2007-08-20 11:42:00,418,Try vinagar and water and if this doesn't work spray nine or toilet bowl cleaner.
105412,Jer,2007-08-20 12:05:00,1426,"  There's a Swish store in Barrie at 526 Bryne Dr. (unit A). The toilet bowl cleaner does an excellent job on both fibreglass and aluminum. You can try Tuby bathroom cleaner as well for something a little less corrosive. Spray or brush on, let sit for a few minutes, lightly scrub and rinse well.  Both are available in smaller 1L bottles as well, you don't need to get a gallon."
