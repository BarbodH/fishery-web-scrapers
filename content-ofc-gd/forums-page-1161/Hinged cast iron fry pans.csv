The lids have ribs with slots in between them. I would post a pic but have no knowledge as to how to do that. Any help would be appreciated in finding out what use these lids did. Rick,"
103866,Fisherman,2007-08-15 00:26:00,7201,Are the slotted ribs on the inside of the lid?

Good bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

105334,Roy,2007-08-20 01:50:00,13728,TOILET!
105345,Greencoachdog,2007-08-20 02:33:00,8163,Okay Okay! ............I'm sorry!!!  They're actually hinged together so it can do double duty as a minnow trap on a camping trip!!!  Geez Loweeze!!!  ... doesn't anybody have a sense of humor anymore!!!
105366,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-20 03:25:00,1183,"  Well you should be!  I got in trouble because of you - and most likely will again.  Rick, OFC, is great.  A sense of humour will add years to your life.  Stay and enjoy it....don't fret over the small stuff."

105697,Greencoachdog,2007-08-21 03:52:00,8163, This is true! One for the bacon and the other for the eggs... also does double duty as a shallow dutch Oven.  I'm sure there are other uses for this device that're only limited by your imigination.
