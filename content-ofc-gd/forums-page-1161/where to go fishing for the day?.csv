105438,walleyebob,2007-08-20 15:05:00,27,How is the fishing in the Midland area this time of year. Me and a friend are going fishing tommorrow but have no idea of where to try. I only have a 12 aluminum boat so big water is out of the question. we are in the barrie area and don't want to travel much more than an hour or so since it's only a day trip. Any lake suggestions would be appreciated.
