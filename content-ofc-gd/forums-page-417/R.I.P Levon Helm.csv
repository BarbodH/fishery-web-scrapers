688438,SmokestackLightnin,2012-04-19 20:39:00,390,Sad to see him gone. Saw in the paper last week that he was in the final stages of his battle. Never saw him with The Band but did take in a number of club appearances in Toronto he did a number of years back with Rick Danko. And now they're both gone.
688439,Jigger,2012-04-19 20:43:00,1237,Wow. Thats a bummer. Gonna have to throw on some vinyl in memory. Rip Levon.
688440,bushart,2012-04-19 20:46:00,2628,I'm a big fan of The Band  It was sad to hear of this news
688474,esoxansteel,2012-04-19 22:32:00,1307,"Seen Levon Helm at the Pines in Bridgenorth, and it is truly said to see these legends disappear, one of the greatest bands that ever formed and played, although it was much too short, and the Last Waltz was a legendary performance, with great artist, and was tyhe end of an era for the BAND"
688508,scugpg,2012-04-19 23:16:00,1373,Definitely worth checking out the last waltz its a great movie...rip levon

688540,superdad,2012-04-20 00:27:00,353,Saw him with Dylan at the Old Montreal Forum when Dylan and the Band toured in the 'Before the Flood' Tour. In fact we waited from 0500 outside the Forum to get our tickets and we got 32 tickets in a single row on the floor. We all lite sparklers (beforethey were banned from concerts).  It was a great night....  Levon will be missed  David  aka  Superdad
688543,bushart,2012-04-20 00:29:00,2628,Also should be noted that Richard Manuel--(Piano) passed away some years ago  Leaving Robbie and Garth---who is a neighbor to some of ya down in the Dundas-- Waterdown hood  The Band had a few Ontario connections---I believe Rick Danko was from Port Dover and Robbie from TO also had ties at 6 Nations
688548,Roy,2012-04-20 00:47:00,13728,"I met Lavon I think it was at the Riverboat in Yorkville. A good yak with him about Ronnie Hawkins...the dude was a champ. He lost his voice many years ago but his daughter worked with him to make it better, and it did come back. That was after the Band years. I have almost everything he ever did. The Band's last concert is a classic that I watch from time to time on DVD. RIP my friend....."
688550,dave524,2012-04-20 00:54:00,4508," Same tour I saw Dave, only in T.O. they did a lottery for tickets at the extravagant sum of $20 each I recall. They did 2 shows Jan 74. at the old Maple Leaf Gardens."
688630,turtle,2012-04-20 10:21:00,274,I saw Levon and his band twice at Massey Hall in the last 2-3 years.  Glad I did.  The last time he looked more frail than the first and had a humidfier blowing on him at his drum kit. Still a great showman and both great concerts.
