688729,Harrison,2012-04-20 16:05:00,2202," Holy!! Ha, have to think of a caption for that!"
617474,Harrison,2011-08-31 18:25:00,2202,Need a picture of someone kissing a fish I can use for eTackle.ca  The ones I took did not turn out (too much tongue)  It would be appreciated.  Thanks.
617475,solopaddler,2011-08-31 18:29:00,8605,"I don't have one in my files, but I can get you one tomorrow."
617477,ccmtcanada,2011-08-31 18:31:00,7971," Tongue?  That's a real problem when you are kissing walleye, pike or musky I'd imagine!!!  Pretty sure Rich has some pics like that?  But do carp count as fish???"
617478,Roy,2011-08-31 18:32:00,13728,I take Moniques.

617503,solopaddler,2011-08-31 20:15:00,8605,"  Close Dan, but that's just a tease."
617507,ChrisK,2011-08-31 20:30:00,2772,"Dan,that doesn't count...You got to swap spit like in the commercial with the Lg mouth bass."
617510,Harrison,2011-08-31 20:32:00,2202,I dunno.  I am liking it Dan.  Can I use it.
617511,danbouck,2011-08-31 20:35:00,4380,Ya you can use it. I thought I had better ones but they have too much tongue as well
617512,fishnsled,2011-08-31 20:36:00,3520,"  You should be more careful Dan, ever see the show 1000 Ways to Die? Girl had a fish caught in her throat and died. Better keep those lips closed and no tongue."
