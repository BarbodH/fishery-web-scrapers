688604,Peps,2012-04-20 03:01:00,191,"Mercman,  Our dryer is putting out some serious heat. It normally doesn't get very hot in our laundry room  when it runs but the last couple of times it has been very warm in there. So could it be over heating? I have checked the vent hose and it is still attached.........    Peps"
688607,Dondorfish,2012-04-20 03:05:00,1000,Turn the dryer on and go outside to the vent - make sure that you are getting a good flow of air coming out. The vent and vent hose could be plugged and the heat is staying inside.  Tracker (Don)
688608,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-20 03:06:00,10439,Definately!!! Don't use it until you check the vent line as it could be blocked. You might want to take the back off the dryer too to check for lint build up. The last place I lived in I don't think they ever emptied the lint trap and there was nearly a full garbage bag worth of lint packed up inside the back of the dryer.  They do have a system in place that shuts doen the element if it gets too hot though.  You might check to see if the vent line has come loose as well. This would be dumping heat into the laundry room.

They are the worst lint collecters. Run the entire vent system with either aluminum or galvanized pipe."
688620,Peps,2012-04-20 03:48:00,191,Thanks fellas will check it in the morning
688646,mercman,2012-04-20 11:54:00,7054,"Normally there are thermostats that stop it from overheating.Even if the vent is blocked, the thermostat will stop the element from heating past a set safe temperature, usually around 220-240 degrees.Definately check the venting.Birds may have built a home in the end of the pipe. Detach the venting from the back of the dryer, and run it.If it still overheats, the problem is in the dryer itself.  Let me know make and model number."
688707,Peps,2012-04-20 14:42:00,191,"checked the venting this morning, all clear.  It was blowing pretty good. Mercman i will post the model# when I get home later tonight, I do know its a Kenmore.  Thanks guys...... Sandro"
688855,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 23:50:00,5865,Merc know his stuff....at least he told me he does...LOL...no really he does.  But we do entertain a dryer fire now and then in the town because the vent was plugged.....so don't take anything for granted.
688866,Terry,2012-04-21 00:13:00,14456,This s what happens when a dryer catches fire in a basement  
688923,spud7378,2012-04-21 02:51:00,68,"yeah i have been to a few dryer fires, get that checked before you use it again, it may be just so dirty inside that there is no air movement, you may have to take the back off and have a good clean! i do that at least once a year!"
688931,mercman,2012-04-21 03:14:00,7054,"  Excellent advice. First thing is to disconnect the vent pipe at the back of the dryer. Run it and see if it still overheats.If it doesnt, then get a dryer vent cleaning brush the length of the vent and clean it really good, you have some kind of blockage."
688932,Peps,2012-04-21 03:16:00,191,Ok it's a Kenmore C84052  I  will take the panel off tomorrow and have a look.  Thanks again guys  Peps
