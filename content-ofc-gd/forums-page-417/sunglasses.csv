688225,alphaalpha,2012-04-19 02:24:00,475,"Hey all, I have been looking for a pair of thin armed polarized sunglasses for a while.  I want the thin arm as the normal thicker arms under my hat usually give me a headache after fishing for a couple hours.  Maybe I have an odd shaped head or I just like my hats a little tighter but I am finding it hard to find a pair of glasses that fit nice with a hat (which is needed to protect my balding head  ).  I have seen a couple online but can't seem to find any polarized ones to try on at stores that have thin arms.  I would also like them rather dark.  If anyone has any personal preferences on makes/models I would love to hear them before buying something online.  I don't want to go too crazy as I am usually pretty hard on my shades but anything in the sub $100 range would be cool.  Thanks,  AA."

688236,GBW,2012-04-19 02:37:00,8460,Did you check out the new ones by Sundog?  Mark Melnyk Signature Series might have what you are after but I don't know the price range.
688242,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-19 02:55:00,10439,How 'bout these? You be lookin' cool 80's style!!!!    Actually Rayban  has a bunch of wire frames that might fit the bill and a lot of vision places carry them.
688243,GBW,2012-04-19 02:59:00,8460,I like my Rayban's a lot!
688247,alphaalpha,2012-04-19 03:08:00,475," I do have an optical plan but as I have perfect vision I have never gone to an optometrist.  It would be great to take advantage of that (maybe say I need them for my commute   )   @GBW most of the sundogs look to have fairly thick arm bands.  @drifter and GBW the raybans do look nice actually, any idea on a good place to get a deal on a pair and do you find the aviator types ok when driving the boat at higher speeds?  I have a pair of aviators that are a little larger on my face and I find the wind really comes in on the sides....The problem is the ones I have are not polarized.  Thanks for the quick replies!  -AA."
688248,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-19 03:17:00,10439,Here are thier Polarized Glass Models. There are several that have wire frames and 3 are wrap around types that will catch less wind. Plenty of deals on ebay. Go to your local optometrist/eye glass place and find a pair you like and hit up the auctions for a deal.
688255,manitoubass2,2012-04-19 03:41:00,11391,I love my blueblockers
688271,Gregoire,2012-04-19 10:21:00,1397,They sell ray bans at costco
688273,fishindevil,2012-04-19 10:23:00,6254,only one kind bro  maui_ jim    !!!!! the best there is anywheres from $100 to $300 you will never want another pair !!!!
688278,whiskywizard,2012-04-19 11:02:00,305, ^ l l This!
688284,Christopheraaron,2012-04-19 11:34:00,3525,You could also get a pair that has a strap instead of arms?
688293,Nipfisher,2012-04-19 11:55:00,2449,"  Yep, you could get them for driving. My prescription Oakleys are polarized and have the anti-glare coating. I'm guessing your plan will cover the 1st $250-$300."
688312,Raf,2012-04-19 12:54:00,3495,"just be aware that the thin arm glasses will allow light into your eyes through the sides.  you're probably thinking soo what? but it makes a big difference and a reason the wraparounds with thick arms are favourted for fishing.  you have a sail close to you in oshawa, maybe check them out to try on different kinds."
688376,JoshS,2012-04-19 16:40:00,729,"If you want a quick cheap fix, berkley sells those cheap ones (around $15) that have super light frames.  They're cheap glasses but very light on the face. I sometimes switch to them when I feel the pressure of the other frames on my temples."
688386,Fish4Eyes,2012-04-19 17:20:00,1022,Maui Jim has real thin arms that are made of titanium on some glasses. They are pricey. See PM for more details.
688573,alphaalpha,2012-04-20 01:46:00,475,Thanks so much all for the suggestions and advice.  Always great to get the opinions of fellow fisherman instead of just relying on online reviews.  Hopefully I will have some new shades soon and will let you know which I pick up.  Thanks again!  -AA
