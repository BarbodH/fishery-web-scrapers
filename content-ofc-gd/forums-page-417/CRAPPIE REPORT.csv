688059,Pikeslayer,2012-04-18 20:58:00,1443,"I played hookie for a few hours today and visited a little urban lake (somewhere in Zone 16   ) that is literally minutes from my home. I didn't expect anything other than a relaxing break from the day. Heck, I've rarely been known to fish from shore let alone for panfish. There was quite a few (a couple of dozen?) other fisherman there as well and when I saw them landing fish upon my arrival, things were looking up. I had a line in the water within 5 minutes of arrival, and a fish on 10 seconds later. A decent crappie. Very surprised. Within the hour, I had landed 2/3 of my possession limit. All good sized crappie + a couple of decent sized blugill. Another surprise.  So here's a couple of pics. Left out any of the lake and surroundings even though I don't think this place is a big secret.    These were 'typical' size wise. A few a little smaller, a few a little bigger.    Looks like I've found a nice little lake (more like a big pond) that I can 'retreat' to when I have an hour or two to pass the time.  Slayer"
688062,Terry,2012-04-18 21:01:00,14456,"nice going, I need to get into a few of them myself..."
688068,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-18 21:09:00,2690,Awesome Simon!!  I'd love to get into a few of those babies
688071,misfish,2012-04-18 21:16:00,29133,  Cold water they are awesome.Summer water thier crap.  So do you marinade them in the Crown? Nice brand BTW
688074,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 21:19:00,5784,"Nice suprise find! Who needs a boat, eh?  Sin... I tried some rock bass and they were terrible, they stunk and everything. Might have something to do with the water they were caught in."
688092,Pikeslayer,2012-04-18 21:49:00,1443,"Not too sure Sinclair. The bottle was full when I started to clean them. Not so much when I finished As far as taste? Not sure there either. Everything went into the food processor together for another batch of cat treats.   Actually, I was celebrating your belated birthday Brian. Looks like you had a good oneand many more to come  Tried it but not the same flavour. Decent enough though. 3 out of 5 in my book."
688107,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-18 22:17:00,2582,Nice haul. I have a little crappie/mudcat honey hole close to our house as well. When I work the afternoon shift I sometimes head over after an early lunch and fish for 2-3 hours before I go to work. Love it.  BTW I have a friend who loves rock bass. Whenever we catch any in the spring he throws them in my basket. After a few trips of this I kept a few to try myself. I actually liked them better then crappie.  If they are coming from cold water I would highly recommend you give them a try.
688113,Pikeslayer,2012-04-18 22:30:00,1443, I thought you just filmed fish Terry  JK
688116,krixxer,2012-04-18 22:44:00,274,since we are talking about fish how would you rate single barrel JD.
688123,mercman,2012-04-18 22:58:00,7054,  Cats seem to like em
688140,crossover,2012-04-18 23:34:00,172,"I caught some huge rock bass at Bonnechere and they tasted pretty good when eaten alone, but were very mushy and crap when eaten alongside a perch."
688142,Christopheraaron,2012-04-18 23:39:00,3525,I just walked in the door from a secret crappie spot that I didn't know existed until 1 hour ago! (I'm sure a few of you know where it is)
688144,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-18 23:42:00,2582, Perch are by far my favorite fresh water fish. Nothing measures up to them head to head IMHO.
688146,lovetofish,2012-04-18 23:43:00,500,"The cleaner and colder the weather, the better the rock bass taste(just like most other fish).  Try not to keep the very big  fish, better to keep the medium to large fish.  LTF"
688148,SirCranksalot,2012-04-18 23:45:00,3291,Nice report---I don't see anything crappie about it!
688150,Billy Bob,2012-04-18 23:45:00,5865,CAT TREATS....you're feed those tasty crappies to friggin CATS...  I going to report you to....to....to someone....I know there a law against this....there must be...RIGHT...
688165,Pikeslayer,2012-04-19 00:05:00,1443,"   Yuze guys must be 'dog people'     used to have one myself. Sega, a golden. She used to get venison treats. Now I make them for my neighbours dogs. They love 'em."
688263,Big Cliff,2012-04-19 08:16:00,6899,"That does it, I'm coming down to your place this weekend, I can't seem to find any decent numbers of crappie up here. Nice catch!"
688269,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 10:18:00,5865, If you do Cliff......don't bring your dog....he's not a dog guy....on the way maybe pick up a possum or something along the road and maybe Pike Slayer will share his spot with you....
688340,Leecher,2012-04-19 14:25:00,7832,Nice haul of crappies Simon   Some good eats in that bucket
688379,mike rousseau,2012-04-19 16:46:00,4661,"nice catch buddy...  our crappie bite shut down after that warm weather came to an end...never really got into any GOOD days of fishing...     our walleye HERE taste as good as perch in my opinion...and e few other ""perch lovers"" have said the same...i gave a guy a pack the other day....it was his first time eating anything other then perch.... he said it was just as good...  little trick is to cut your fillets lengthwise to create 2 thinner fillets when eating bigger fish like bass...walleye...pike...etc...then your butter...batter...garlic...lemon...whatever you ad in has the same ratio to perch..."
688506,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 23:11:00,5865,Now Simon...if you would of kept a few tasty tasty tasty.....let me say it again...TASTY Crappies....I would of traded some perch for them...  .....but now I have to deal with the friggin cat....
