688272,Fish Farmer,2012-04-19 10:21:00,2234,"Miller, your the MAN Congrats on the Big Brown. Imagine catching that baby in the Yak. Check your PM Josh"
688280,miller,2012-04-19 11:23:00,223, usually just 2/5oz cleos do the job
688303,johnnyb,2012-04-19 12:17:00,3413,Beautiful fish there....especially that monster brown!!!   Great report....keep'em coming
688310,torco,2012-04-19 12:50:00,656,Congrats that brown is just a pig!
688311,Steve,2012-04-19 12:51:00,2075,"yep, she's a pig!  Only the second 20lbs'er I've seen since 2004.  She's longer than my big girl, just a little less girthy.  22lbs even looks like an exact weight.  Congradulations - a huge accomplishment. Released?  I released mine, but still kick myself for doing it....would have made a great wall mount!  Miller - again, congradulations. A huge feat to top 20lbs with a brown. ESPECIALLY WITH A LAKE BROWN - not a port D ditch brown.  AMAZING."
688316,Headhunter,2012-04-19 13:00:00,5703,Awesome! What a pig! HH
688319,bucktail,2012-04-19 13:02:00,1857,Great fish man!!!
688322,miller,2012-04-19 13:20:00,223, yep released. i never keep trophy fish i'd rather them carry on that gene pool
688327,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-19 13:40:00,310,"Awesome brown dude, congrats on your PB."
688343,Leecher,2012-04-19 14:30:00,7832,Congrats Miller on that beauty hog
688359,Steve,2012-04-19 15:36:00,2075,great news Miller.  Yours looks like a male as well.  Mine was a male.  Males have a better chance of growing that large - due to some anglers need to kill/rape browns for bait.
688374,JoshS,2012-04-19 16:36:00,729,"That's a beast!! Gotta love how aggressive browns can be at times. One of my favourite spring fish to go after for sure.  My buddy and I have been hitting them at night on topwaters when they're finicky during the day... We've only hooked 5 or so out of probably 30 blow ups, they're definitely not designed to take in topwaters easily. Give it a shot if they're not on in the daylight and it's relatively calm. You'll hook more on cranks though but the excitement keeps at least one of us throwing the topwater.  No 20 pounders like that one though, beauty fish!!"
688404,Skud,2012-04-19 18:17:00,739,Great Brown. Many fine fish have been caught while not paying attention to a dropping lure dockside or boatside.
688447,misfish,2012-04-19 21:36:00,29133,Thats one nice hog of a brown. Well done.
688451,bobowski,2012-04-19 21:52:00,360,"Wow, congrats on catching that beast. Nice to hear that it is still swimming as well."
688468,miller,2012-04-19 22:26:00,223," the 19lber i caught in january was actually a hen, i made damn sure she got back to drop those eggs though"
688554,Twocoda,2012-04-20 01:01:00,4130,nice shooting Miller....Good on ya
688562,Moosebunk,2012-04-20 01:18:00,3970,"OK... I'm totally green with envy over here.  That's a heckuva trout in any species... being a brown like that, just wicked!!!  Congrats."
688601,miller,2012-04-20 02:49:00,223,thanks guys
688602,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-20 02:51:00,2690,Congratulations on a beast of a brownie!
688605,danc,2012-04-20 03:02:00,4677,Awesome fish for sure. Good job Mr. Miller.
688922,Mike the Pike,2012-04-21 02:46:00,3421,Always love pics of Browns.Congrats on that lunker!!!!!!!
688124,miller,2012-04-18 23:01:00,223,"made it out friday before work for a half hour and luckily managed two browns.      had the day off today and made the best of it. went chucking spoons into the wind. at the end of a cast i reeled my spoon in and let it drop a bit as i was talking to a buddy when a monster brown smashed it. ended up beating my old pb of 19lbs 1oz with this beast at 22lbs even.    afternoon went float fishing on a river i havn't tried before and managed to hook into a couple fish, got one shaker, one nice bow, lost another, and landed a sucker too. the bow i landed had some deep cuts on one side and scratch marks on the opposing side so it looks as if a eagle or something tried to grab it.    "
688128,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 23:15:00,11391,"Congrats, what superb catch!!!!!!!!"
688130,davey buoy,2012-04-18 23:21:00,5505,"Nice fish:thumbsup_anim:,but those holes are nasty."
688131,Bassnbows,2012-04-18 23:22:00,58,
688134,tb4me,2012-04-18 23:29:00,3295,Nice fishin! Thanks for sharing..
688138,northernpike56,2012-04-18 23:32:00,717,could those holes be the work of a great blue heron?  
688143,Christopheraaron,2012-04-18 23:41:00,3525," I don't think herons go after fish that big, and usually they only take one strike. Nice fish all around!"
688147,rocheleauc,2012-04-18 23:44:00,205,"Wow, what a monster! Very nice!"
688149,Ralph Field,2012-04-18 23:45:00,1018,My bet would be that those holes were the result of a sea gull attack in shallow water.
688151,Joeytier,2012-04-18 23:46:00,3990,"Wow, amazing brown.  Definitely an excellent week of fishing for you, sir!"
688153,lovetofish,2012-04-18 23:49:00,500,Nice Brown!
688155,dave524,2012-04-18 23:51:00,4508,"Lived a 5 minute walk from that pier for 28 years and that is the best brown I've seen taken from there. The marks on that bow, I'd say you are correct, talons from a Eagle or Osprey, probaby too big for it to make off with but sure left a mark"
688156,Gregoire,2012-04-18 23:52:00,1397,"Wow that is a huge brown, congrats!"
688161,fisherman7,2012-04-18 23:58:00,325,Those bites are the mark of a vam-pike! (vampire pike)
688166,solopaddler,2012-04-19 00:06:00,8605,Wow what a slob of a brown! I fished that pier twice this spring with my son and caught squat LOL!
688187,Live2fish85,2012-04-19 00:49:00,1633,Josh that was awesome being there to help with that. The pictures don't do justice.
688189,Grimace,2012-04-19 00:51:00,2020,Great Brown. That is insane.  Congrats!
688191,vinnimon,2012-04-19 00:53:00,2593,"  I was told that you ended up in the drink trying to net it Chris  Just kiddin around, nice haul"
688210,miller,2012-04-19 01:40:00,223, quite often i go down and get skunked. definatly hit or miss but when they are in it sure can be great
688218,atvaholic,2012-04-19 02:03:00,271,Nice Fish! I think the one was attacked by a vampire though...
688245,craigdritchie,2012-04-19 03:05:00,1586,"Beauty brown, congrats! That's a real horse!  Marks on the rainbow look like they were made by a frog spear, or possibly even part of a pitchfork. I've seen native guys spear pike with a frog spear up north and the dual holes from the barbed spear look exactly like the marks on that 'bow."
688261,mike rousseau,2012-04-19 06:28:00,4661,  They eat big fish if the opportunity presents itself... We had a cage in the river when I was younger for keeping minnows... Well one day we got a bunch of smallies... So we tossed em in the cage to clean later.... Later never came... The blue herons emptied the cage... 12-15 smallies up to 3.5-4 pounds...
688262,young_one,2012-04-19 06:46:00,620,What size and style of spoon do you use for Browns? A little smaller than the ones used for Salmon in the fall?
688266,spincast,2012-04-19 09:12:00,3279,Wow - that is a tank of a brownie. Congrats!
688268,fishindevil,2012-04-19 10:13:00,6254,awesome browns !!!!   i think someone was using a huge treble hook and snagging !!!!
