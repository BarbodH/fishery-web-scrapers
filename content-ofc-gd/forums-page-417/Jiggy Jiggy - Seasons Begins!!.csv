687994,TJQ,2012-04-18 18:36:00,7806,"Its been a while since I posted, its been a pretty crazy winter for me. Anyone whose ever had to put their parents in an Old Age home will know what I mean. (Nuf said about that.)  It had been three weeks since there was any snow in Sturgeon so we figured that it would be a safe bet to get into camp. I coudnt believe the snow that was still up there.. a few spots in the road. (Normally I dint even try till May 1st)  Heres some pics from Camp.. I cant wait to get back!  As always Spring Fishing is tough.. we did (WELL I DID) manage tp pull a nice pike off the bottom with a big deep diving crankbait.  Pond behind Camp    Jaden and Jamie   Creek Beside Camp   Very Happy everything was on one piece.. hadnt been back since Nov.   Jaden inAction   Saw our first moose     The boast was nice.    A sight for sore, tired eyes!    Another sight for sore tired eyes.   The trail in.   Fishing in PJ's    TJ 1 - Everyone Else - 0 So far Im in the LEAD!!   Ahh the old snow in the wheelbarrow cooler!!  "
