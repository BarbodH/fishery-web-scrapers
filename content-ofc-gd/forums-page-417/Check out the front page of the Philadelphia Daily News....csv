688332,doubleheader,2012-04-19 13:51:00,497,"Would have loved to have been in the Pens locker room before the game. I'll bet Mario ripped them a good one and then challenged them to start acting like pros. Long way to go to get this back to a series, and I don't think the Pens will come back, but, would love to have been in that locker room."
