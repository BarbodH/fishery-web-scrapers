688671,tb4me,2012-04-20 13:04:00,3295,My wife works all day tomorrow..I was thinking of taking my daughter fishing..Question to the locals or anyone that may know are they being caught there yet? My daughter is young and has a short attention span if she is not catching fish..Thanks folks!
688674,Roy,2012-04-20 13:08:00,13728,Hedge your bets. Bring a bucket of minnows and she'll be able to keep herself occupied between bites.

688799,northernpike56,2012-04-20 21:42:00,717,  maybe port maitland has them?
688814,Twocoda,2012-04-20 22:08:00,4130,Ron with this year being a bit ahead of itself i think you might stand a chance in Port Bruce...you should most definatly get some sheephead and spring suckers that are fun to catch for your daughter...but i doubt very much they will taste very good...if that fails...Port Stanley
688818,tb4me,2012-04-20 22:12:00,3295,well it would appear that my daughter still wants to go..Where can I grab some minnows in the am? Our local tackle shop is closed now..
