688677,lookinforwalleye,2012-04-20 13:15:00,4399, I am sure the Rav is a fine vehicle but when it comes to this segment of the truck group the Liberty is more of a truck than the Rav is and of course that is IMHO! As far as short comings in my life not sure but if I find one I`ll be sure to buy a Tundra!!!
688688,craigdritchie,2012-04-20 13:43:00,1586,That's because the Rav4 isn't a truck - it's built on the same basic platform as the Camry.
688695,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 14:01:00,5865,"Be careful of the Liberty as the tow rating is deceiving with that 5K limit....it requires the following....  Class III receiver hitch has a 2-inch opening and can handle loads of up to 5,000 pounds of gross trailer weight, if a trailer is equipped with a load-equalizing hitch. Check Owner's Manual for hitch types, load capacity and heavy-duty equipment required. Do not exceed rated tow capacity of vehicle as equipped. Towing may require some items not supplied by Mopar®.  Also at that weight you must have brakes on the trailer."
688701,lookinforwalleye,2012-04-20 14:23:00,4399,"For me the Liberty is as close as I could come to the perfect tow vehicle in my price range and for what I am towing, my Stratos 176xt and the 75 Opti come in at 1600 lbs add all the other weight that goes into the equation and I am well under the 5000 Lbs. If anybody is at the 5000 or close to it should not be talking about Liberties or Rav`s as tow vehicles!"
688709,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-20 14:46:00,535,"I bought a new ram quad cab last Jan (with a 4.7 V8) and it gets the job done quite nicely. Towing my boat (which isn't  as heavy as yours) makes a difference in mileage but it isn't a drastic difference, that I've noticed anyway. For $26,000 it's a pretty good deal.  Either way you're going to be shelling out a lot of money for gas while towing with these gas prices. Thankfully I live very close to work so I just walk there which gives me more money to tow the boat around."
688734,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 16:53:00,5865,Forget the RAV4 and get the BIG BOY Tundra....gas prices are coming down here...went from $4.14 per gallon to $4.09 per gallon...  Another reason I like to fish out of the Catt is the Res gas is $3.71 per gallon...
688756,doubleheader,2012-04-20 18:12:00,497,Mine's a 2010 Double Cab.
688920,Mike the Pike,2012-04-21 02:44:00,3421, Actually Smally they can be good on gas but it all depends on how you drive them.  I know 4 people who have these F150 ecoboost. 3 out of the 4 get between 9.5 to 10.5 litres per 100kms on the highway.Thats on cruise at 100kph they tend to hit the 13 litres per 100 in the city.One guy well he is just a lead foot!!!!!  I have the same motor in my 2011 Ford Taurus SEL minus the Turbos.If I drive on cruise on the highway at 100kph I get 8 litres per 100 very good mileage for a 4200 pound car.Much better than our Honda Odyssey.  If I drive the car slowly in the city I can average 11 to 12 litres per 100kms.Get aggressive with fast starts and high rpm's then my average goes to 13 or 14.  all depends on how one drives.Now I wonder how much a fiberglass box hinders the mileage?
688085,atvaholic,2012-04-18 21:37:00,271, Heres a good read on a midsize truck shootout. Includes the taco and ridgeline.

688132,Billy Bob,2012-04-18 23:25:00,5865,The Honda Ridgleline is a great mid size almost truck....if you decide on getting one make sure you hook your boat up and fill it with money on the way to the dealer....those puppies are EXPENSIVE...
688195,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-19 01:10:00,10439, Honda Ridgeline is a Honda Pilot with a pickup bed. So it is the same as a Pilot. And it will pull you boat just fine. Cost on the Pilot and Ridgeline is about the same.
688277,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 10:45:00,5865," Did you know...(you probably do) that Honda doesn't make a vehicle with a V-8 engine.....with the way gas is going, they may be on to something..."

688295,Fish4Eyes,2012-04-19 11:56:00,1022,"My buddy has a Ridgeline and says he really likes the truck. He did mention that when he towed his boss's bass boat to Simcoe it guzzles but does the task effectively. When not towing he was pleased with the fuel economy. Having been in the truck, it is very roomy, even in the back seat. Be warned, they are expensive. Let me know if you want more details pertaining to this truck and I will inquire with my buddy.  I would be calling a few Toyota service manager's to confirm if the V6 in the Rav eats cams like mentioned by one of the previous posters who was told this by a Toyota tech. Have you read any reviews on the Rav from people with high mileage?"
688371,JoshS,2012-04-19 16:22:00,729,"Looking for a used, less expensive tow vehicle too and was checking out the Liberty's. The price is right..  Does anyone else have input on the liberty?"
688405,Guest nuker,2012-04-19 18:18:00,0,I have  ford flex limited awd ecoboost with the class 3 hitch. rated for 4500 lbs  i towed my smokercraft millentia 192 with a 150 on it and does just fine.  i haven't loaded up the car with gear and obviously you'd only be launching at perfect boat ramps!
688411,danbouck,2012-04-19 18:39:00,4380," I had one as a rental and took it back after 2 days. Poor mileage, no room and no power"
688415,JoshS,2012-04-19 18:49:00,729," OH no, doesn't sound to promising. Reviews online are mixed as usual. Room I'm not to concerned about..  the specs seem to look good in terms of power but I'm far from an expert.  Anyone else?"
688421,lookinforwalleye,2012-04-19 19:21:00,4399," Well I have had mine for more than two days and I have no problem with the room and I have no problem with power, I guess if you normally drive a vehicle with 300-400 h.p the 210 h.p of the Liberty might be considered tame but for me and I would suspect for most drivers it`s fine! My Liberty tows my 18 foot Stratos with very little effort in fact you hardly know it`s there, I did a round trip last fall to Nakina and back and the Liberty was jammed and averaged just a hair under 30 mpg and the vehicle is pretty comfortable no sore back or butt after that Nakina jaunt. I am more than happy with my 2008 Liberty and you couldn`t beat the price I think I paid 15K or so and that was with a real nice extened warranty a set of snows and 32k`s on the odo. Comparable vehicles from other mfg`s were running 8-10 grand more and I figured that money buys a lot of gas.  Did anyone mention a Rav 4 is not really a truck a but a grocery getter!!!  Judging by Dan`s avatar he looks like a pretty big boy and I can understand his comment on the room but I am only 5-7"" so I fit fine!!!"
688425,jedimaster,2012-04-19 19:52:00,3472,"I have a 2005 liberty, and I am very happy with it. It doesn't have V8 power, but the 3.7 V6 is plenty enough. Its very comfortable on the highway given it has independant front suspension. I haven't had any issues with mine, but I have only had it for about 3 months now. Pulls a boat with no issues, has a REAL 4x4 system, not an awd. It will get in and out of the hunt camp, pull the boat out of the water on a wet gravel ramp, and its easy to park in the city. The only issue I have is that it is no better on gas than some bigger vehicles. However I knew that as I wanted something heavy and stout enough to safely tow with, but I didn't want the size of a truck as I live and work in the GTA core. Whats good for me may not be good for you. If your primary concern is fuel, than you aren't looking to tow anything serious."
688434,dave524,2012-04-19 20:22:00,4508,"Ditto on the thumbs up for a Liberty, got a 2006 with 52,000 km on the odometer a little over a year ago. Tows my 3500lb capacity  landscape trailer with a yard of topsoil just fine and a 18 foot aluminum with a V4 fine. It is rated to tow 5000 lbs  , realistically 3000 would be my personal max. Price was right and like others have said it is a real 4 wheel drive compared to others in its class. Gas mileage, well being retired I really didn't care as I'd be lucky to drive 10thou km a year now, but it don't seem any worse than the GMC Safari it replaced. Someone else got a 2006 CRD Diesel Liberty same time I got mine, think it might have been Terry, could be some fuel savings with that model."

688441,jedimaster,2012-04-19 20:49:00,3472,"If you get in a good groove on the highway  and don't pass anyone I get about 25 ish I would guess. My durango was rated for 15mpg on the highway and I drove from Cochrane to Port perry on a full tank a few years ago, with 2 adults, 3 kids and lugga loaded to the max, no trailer. Had maybe an 1/16th left in the tank. so I think I got a good 4 or 5 mpg more than the rated amount. Sticker rating aren't real world. It depends on how you drive."
688445,lookinforwalleye,2012-04-19 21:26:00,4399,"  I think your numbers are for the itsy bitsy US gallon and I don`t know how 29/30 mpg is 1000 km`s a tank perhaps that new fangled new math   , 16 gallons x 29 = 464 miles or 742 km`s the 2008 Liberty is rated as 29 mpg hiway and has a 16 imperial gallon tank and if memory serves I did indeed average 29-30 miles per gallon which in all honesty surprised me...but I wasn`t driving 120-130 kmh or passing a car every 5 minutes pretty easy to getgood  mileage figures on that stretch of hiway. City mpg is another story!"

688454,lookinforwalleye,2012-04-19 22:03:00,4399," I think 25 mpg on the highway in the south would be about right but up north on those long stretches without stopping is a different story,set the cruise for 90/95 and relax! Fuel mileage ratings vary obviously but under ideal conditions can be attained unfortunately ideal conditions are rarely a reality, I am assuming the 22 mpg the op stated was a US figure and of course the US gallon is 20% smaller."

688640,SlowPoke,2012-04-20 11:09:00,2984,Just because you can carry two more bags of groceries in your Liberty doesn't quite elevate it to truck status. Is there perhaps some short comings in your life that you are compensating for?
688652,12footspringbok,2012-04-20 12:04:00,459, LOL  I downsized last year from a full sized ram to a grocery getter similar to  Rav4. It was nice having the big truck but I have little regrets about trading it in almost a year later.
688653,doubleheader,2012-04-20 12:06:00,497,"I don't know how many miles you drive/year, let alone how many are pulling a load, but it has been my experience that I get about 20% better fuel economy pulling my boat with a V-8, in my case the 5.7L Tundra, than I did pulling my boat with the V-6 Honda Ridgeline. Pulling the boat I got 12mpg with the Ridgeline and I get almost 15mpg with the Tundra @60mph. Open highway miles without a load I get 19mpg with the Tundra if I keep in under 70mph, and with the Ridgeline about 20-21. City miles with the Tundra is really bad, maybe, if I'm lucky, 12mpg, I don't remember what it was in the Ridgeline but it wasn't good either. I don't drive a lot of miles, less than 10,000/yr, and about 2,000 of those are towing so mileage isn't a huge consideration for me. Cabin noise in the Tundra is about 50% what it was in the Ridgeline. Sorry I can't comment on the Liberty, but if it's rated for 5,000lb you'll be fine, just don't expect better mileage than you'd get from a V-8."

688667,Raf,2012-04-20 12:52:00,3495," This is an important point that I may have mentioned earlier but I'll mention it again, I saw the same mileage improvement on the hwy when I switched from a 6 Cyl Cherokee to a V8 Grand Cherokee.  My mileage on the highway towing and not towing is actually better in the V8 than it was in the I6.  In the city, the V8 is a little worse."
687798,John Bacon,2012-04-18 03:24:00,3277,"My understanding is that the towing capacity is for combined weight towed and in the vehicle, which included passengers. Thus, if you have 700 pounds of people and 300 pounds of gear then your 3,500 capacity is down to 2,500 pounds. I am not sure where curb wheight comes into play.  My wife owns a Rav4 and it has been a great vehicle. However, I wouldn't consider towing 1,300kg with it. I consider it to be pretty good on gas but my other vehicle is a GMC Jimmy so that is relative."

687926,smally21,2012-04-18 15:43:00,993,"just some reading likely been stated already..  . A vehicle's GCWR is a specific weight determined by the manufacturer to be the maximum weight of a loaded tow vehicle and its attached loaded trailer. The total weight of the tow vehicle and trailer should never exceed the manufacturer's listed GCWR [source: Ford Motor Company].  Similar to a vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating, or GVWR, the gross combination weight rating is a specific maximum weight limit determined by the manufacturer. The major difference is that the GCWR takes into account two individual (yet attached) vehicles -- the tow vehicle and the trailer. However, the gross combination weight rating definition doesn't really state how the weight rating is calculated. According to Ford Motor Company, the GCWR is calculated by adding the following weights together: The vehicle's listed curb weight, allowable payload, driver and passenger weight and trailer weight [source: Ford Motor Company].  It's important to remember that the GCWR is not an actual measurement of the weight of a tow vehicle and a trailer, but rather the combined maximum weight limit that the manufacturer has set for the two vehicles once attached.   We towed all of our trailers and boats with half ton trucks. exceeded gcwr's daily. sometimes out spare ""pathfinder"" would join the cause and it was a very capable tow machine...vacationed with our 27' Doral in tow much more than it should have."
687929,Flappn,2012-04-18 16:00:00,245, The only thing I have heard about the Rav4 v6 is that it shares the same motor with the v6 Camry which was rushed for Nascar and blows Cams. I have a friend that works at Toyota who services our 4 cylinder Rav and tells me every time to be thankful I purchased the 4 vs the 6.  Toyota tacome is ROCK SOLID!! Nothing else to say.  I have a 1998 Toyota 4runner with 406K and still going strong.....
687956,icefisherman,2012-04-18 17:26:00,952," Lot of people have said good words about the towing capabilities of Toyota Tacoma, but none of them has said anything about its fuel economy....and I am afraid they cannot say lots of good things about that? Possibly as bad as my old Pathfinder , i.e.gas hog big time....lots of vehicles out there have huge towing capabilities, my problem is almost ALL of them are terrible on gas unfortunately though...  So we need to compare fully all characteristics not just one....  with gas soon to be $1.50/l I am not sure what I value more....couple thousand lbs towing capacity that maybe ovekill considering infrequent and short haul use on my side, or much much better gas mileage that keeps money in my pocket weekly....different priorities, I guess....

687974,craigdritchie,2012-04-18 18:04:00,1586,I wouldn't consider a Rav4 for towing anything bigger than a 14 foot tinny.
687980,Fish4Eyes,2012-04-18 18:17:00,1022,"You simply can't get the best of both worlds icefisherman. You compromise safety for fuel economy if you tow with a vehicle that is cutting it close to the max tow rating or you spend big money at the pumps if you buy something that can tow the boat with ease.  Not sure how well it does on fuel when it tows or how reliable it is but the Cherokee 3.0 CRD might be a good option for you and there should be plenty coming off lease as we speak. It has a benz diesel in it and If I remember correctly its rated to tow 7000lb+ and is rated at 29ish mpg (not towing). Stay far far away from the liberty CRD, the motors were a nightmare. A simple google search will back up what I'm saying.  I thought of you yesterday when I saw a Rav4 on the highway and thought, that hatch sure as heck does not have any room for anything. You could barely fit the weeks groceries in the hatch. Something to consider when going on longer trips with the kids. I'm not a big fan of storing anything in the boat when trailering, especially considering I do not have a proper snap on cover."
687982,smally21,2012-04-18 18:23:00,993,"my tacoma averages 19-20 MPG combined, as do most on the toyota nation forum. a full highway run doesn't show much improvement.  drops to about 15-16MPG pulling a 3000lb load. handles it well but not like the 1500s i had before.  owning the tacoma has resulted in moderate savings over the full size im used to driving. considering its smaller bed, interior and reduction in overall towing ability its unlikely i would do it again over a full size.  but nothing but good things to say great vehicle.  all the research in the world isnt going to unlock the gas company handcuffs. drive what you like, what you can afford. EVERYBODY has tried to find a cheap way to get their boat to the lake. if their was an answer youd have it by the fourth page.  fishing trips all start at the gas station. the long ones often end there too."
687983,icefisherman,2012-04-18 18:26:00,952,"Fish4Eyes,  I have a feeling most people when talking about RAV4 are making comments based on what they've seen or know of the 4 cyl version....heck many don't even know it comes with V6 as well....and may have never seen one on the road....not that ,many of them really....night and day difference in size, power, towing everything....in most cases people driving on the road see a car from the back...and you can not tell easily if it is a 4 or 6 cyl. RAV4 only looking at the back....at the front it has a small V6 attached to the radiator grill area...and it does look bigger but it may not be easily seen from the road. Definately has a lof of room compared to the 4 cyl one....If you Google it and read some reviews you'll see nothing but great reviews of the V6 version....extremely high resale value too...I think most people commenting against it here might be suprised when they see me towing my Lund with it.... ;-)) By the way I was loading the Lund with camping stuff even when using the Pathfinder to tow it with ;-)  I've suffered so much at the gas pumps in the last 5-6 years with the PATHFINDER that if anything I am ready to error on the side of the fuel economy this time....paying $200 for a trip for Erie eyes is simply unsustainable....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
687984,Lunatic,2012-04-18 18:26:00,536,"The way I see it is if you want to Save gas towing go with a v8 because it will take less effort to do so. Want to save gas in town with out towing go 4 or 6 cyl. So the question is which do you do most often? You said earlier you go short distances so I'd just go with the smaller engine. I wouldn't over look GM SUVs or trucks, they've been doing this a long time and all of mine have been great. My 93 full-size had just over 500,000km on her before I sold it. It's worth looking into all options and most companies."
687991,jedimaster,2012-04-18 18:33:00,3472,"I mean seriously, I don't think you are going to find ANYONE, including a rav owner(I asked one) that would say its safe to tow 3k pounds with a rav, v6 or 4 cyl. For a short one off, yah maybe, but for a regularly planned event, not even close to safe.  Plain and simple 3000 pounds is a good chunk to tow, add your family to mix and some luggage and you you are into a 4 runner, Pathfinder, Xterra, Liberty, wrangler, cherokee, Pilot, highlander etc... These are all capable of safely towing that much weight.  Here is a perfectly acceptable comparison. I used to have a Durango. Rated for 10,000 pounds towing capacity. I  once towed a 7500 pound trailer with it. Would I have ever considered towing 9000 pounds? or 9500 pounds or 10,000 pounds.... HELLL NOOO!!! Not a friggin chance.  When you reach to limit of your towing rating you are asking for trouble. Yo may be fine on a few trips, but that one time you are going down a big hill at 80km's an hour, and you have no choice but to ginger your brake a few times becaus eyour engine revs can't keep your speed in check, then at the bottom of the hill a jerk in a honda civic cuts you off and you grab a mit full or brakes and there is nothing there, your life and passengers lives will flash before your eyes right quick.  If you're towing 3,000 pounds, look for a tow vehicle capable of pulling at least 4500 - 5000 pounds. This will give you enough headroom to have passengers and luggage. Of course if your priority is to go strictly by whats on the sticker versus whats generally accepted as safe go ahead and do it and don't look back. If your primary concern is to save gas, then your primary concern can't be towing 3000 pounds. The two objectives just don't meet up. To tow that much weight around is going to put you into the 20mpg or less grouping. Some mid size crew cab trucks may hit 20mpg on the highway or maybe even some hibrid style gas cars, maybe a diesle. The reality is you are facing physics. Weight being pulled needs to be supported by suspension, tranny, coolers, stronger axles, steering systems, big vented brakes, strong frames etc... All of this leads to poor gas mileage.  As much as you quickly dismissed a libery. That is exactly why I went with one. It gave me the ability to seat 5 passengers, Tow a boat safely, and had the best fuel mileage of a city streetable(means no big trucks) vehicle. A Highlander is the one possible option as I believe they have a 5k pound towing capacity for some models. They unfortunatly are out of my price range. Thats why I went with a Liberty. They are dirt cheap. I bought a 2005 with 105km's on it for 5 grand. I was looking at 10 grand for a similar spec higlander, That 5 grand difference is a whole lot of gas money, and by the time I turn the liberty around in a few years I won't have saved nearly that much on gas.  JMHO of course, take it for what you will.  My last word on this thread is posted here on this link... its a list of vehicles that can two 5000 pounds. This is my rec based your your requirement of towin a boat that weighs 3,000 pounds...  http://autos.aol.com/car-finder/style-suv/5000-lb-towing-capacity/5-passenger/  EDIT  You can add in a price match, hit under 30 grand, and then sort by MPG Highest to lowest. and go from there."

Making up one's mind doesn't mean agreeing with any particular opinion...just considering them in the process. Not ignoring any points, just trying to compare all options fully....not just the towing capacity and not just the economy....but all of the various characteristics. It is obvious more powerful vehicles have much worse economy....and the economical ones suffer with the towing parameters....so finding the golden middle for ME will mean I have then made up my mind  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
688061,jedimaster,2012-04-18 21:01:00,3472,"The more I dig into this, and to be honest this is the last post I am going to post in here, is in reference to this thread. Some very good points to read in that thread here are just a few...  1) Manufacturers don't account for any passengers or fuel when determining towing capacity so you MUST take that into account. 2) Plan on 80% of your rated towing capacity for the safe weight limit of your trailer, as this will give you room to fill up your tank of gas, passengers and luggage. 3) Go on the side of caution when towing.  Perhaps consider selling the boat and getting a lighter one.  This will save you money on the water as well as when towing.   http://www.airforums.com/forums/f463/how-much-can-i-safely-tow-with-my-99-lincoln-navigator-19039.html  As for my rec, it sounds like you have your heart set on a toyota, no biggie they make great vehicles. Grab a highlander and your off to the races."

P.S. Just to provoke you to post again ;-)) what about Honda Ridgeline? No one mentioned it so far but it seems capable towing vehicle...again fuel economy aside  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
688078,jedimaster,2012-04-18 21:25:00,3472,"Yep thats why I ended up with a liberty and not a highlander, or else there would be a higlander in my driveway. I considered a Rav but, I just didn't feel safe having that as my primary to vehicle.  For me it came down to this. I expect to keep my Liberty for 3 years. I currently spend about 200 per month in gas with it.Now a highlander would have saved me maybe 10 percent on fuel. Thats 240 dollars a year savings over 3 years, thats 720 dollars. an equal year and km higlander would have been about 5,000 dollars more. The way I figured it, I  bought the liberty and I am sticking 120 dollars a month more in my pocket every month including the extra gas I spend over the highlander for the next 3 years. Thats enough for a couple new rods, some extra rsp money, and a new gun for the hunting season, as well as more gas for the boat. Just something to consider. You could even put that extra money buying a domestic, and stick it in an TFSA until you need it for repairs and you will still come out ahead.  As for the ridgeline its a pretty decent looking vehicle, not sure if it came before the chevy one that looks similar. Mind you the honda is a unibody truck so its not going to be a like a turck but likely much better than an suv."

I'd never consider a rav4 to be a serious tow vehicle unless we're talking a utility trailer to your neighbourhood yard sales.  Tacomas are nice and a great choice but be prepared to pay, unbelievable resale.  cityfisher, there's something wrong with your jeep or your right foot.  I get between 10-11 l/100 on the hwy (not towing) if i keep it under 115 in my 02 Limited v8.  Towing my 1000lb rig, I'm around 12-13 keeping it ~100-105km/hr."

I pull my dads 18ft Princecraft around with no problems. Prior to the FJ I was in an '07 Dodge Durango with the Hemi in it. The wife wrote it off (not her fault) so with the insurance $$ we got the FJ. HUGE difference in the rides. I also use the FJ for back lake fishing trips as it's a super capable off-roader right out of the box. Yes, you'll pay more, but you might as well get exactly what you want when you purchasing a vehicle."

687468,icefisherman,2012-04-17 15:44:00,952," Is your friend's RAV4 the 4 or 6 cyl version?  I am confused a  bit here guys...if a vehicle is rated officialy for 3500 lbs towing and I am about 15-20% less than that...I cannot understadn why it will not be able to tow it? Yes we all wish we have double of tripple towing capacity but it is not always possible nor in the cards for many reasons. Again my Pathfinder is 3500lbs as well and I remember many many people telling me how it's pushing it with my 2800 lbs boat/trailer combo but I've personally done if for last 5 years not one issue ever. So now I am looking at considerably more powerful vehicle (100 HP more than the Pathfinder) and certified to tow 3500 lbs...so really don't see why it can't do it, what are those tow rating for then?!?....if anything I'd expect to do it bestter/easier than the Pathfinder...and save me ton of money in the process on mileage. It may not tow as powerful as some V8 engine but sure enough it should not have any issues with meager 2800 Lbs. behind itself ;-) We are not talking here about some 25 feet fiberglass boat that weights tripple than  mine guys ;-)  Anyone here who owns a RAV4 V6 Version using it to tow who can share personal experience on it?"
687470,BillM,2012-04-17 15:45:00,17367,"It's not the towing that gets people in trouble, it's the stopping (or lack thereof)."
687477,johnnyb,2012-04-17 15:52:00,3413,"It WILL be able to tow it...that's what the ratings are for.  The ratings don't necessarily take into account how frequently you tow though.  It may not hold up as well as the pathfinder or a beefier vehicle...but there are things you can do to help it last longer and put up with the extra strain.  Heavy duty engine and transmission cooling can be added on, and sometimes they will come as part of the vehicle's tow package.  Also trailer brakes I'd say would be a must in this case. The only other thing I can think of that you should look at is the torque difference between the Rav and the Pathfinder.   The extra horsepower will be useless if there isn't enough torque."
687486,icefisherman,2012-04-17 16:25:00,952," All good points Johnny. But they are not new to me as I've done it for years with the same boat and the Pathfinder. Should have mentioned tow use is average of once a week for say 6-7 months/year...most towing is 25km/25 min from home to Lake O.....maybe 7-8 longer trips per year of say 300 km round trip average. Hardly anything too exsessive that will kill any vehicle. I know stopping is something to consider ...again have plenty of experience and know how to stop with the trailer behind...done it zillions times, nothing super special there really...just take it easy on the brake pedal and think well ahead, keep distance etc.  By the way...246 lb-ft of torque for the RAV4 V6 vs. 196 lb·ft for the Pathfinder....so 25% higher than the Pathfinder in that department. And I have seen RAV4 V6 coming originally wth included heavy duty towing package... You wouldn't believe how often I see people towing bigger boats than mine launching at Port Credit behind a sedan like Toyota Camry, Suburus, etc. ;-)))  Best thing is to hear/read someone who owns one of those RAV4 V6 beauties to see how he likes towing with it...."
687487,jedimaster,2012-04-17 16:27:00,3472,"Yes its a v6 rav. ad as the others have stated its not the pulling its the braking, the shocks, the suspension componets, the unibody frame. Over time that much weight puts alot of stress on things. Will it pull it. My corolla will pull a 10,000 pound skid steer. That doesn't mean its safe and good for the vehicle long term.  V6 or V8 Isn't as much of a concern to me when pulling anything. I am concerned about the brakes, suspension, weight and frame.  You are like a teter toter when you're towing and your hitch is the bigfat guy jumping on the other end, your rear wheels are the center and you are sitting on the bumper...  We all know that the most braking is done with the front wheels, as well the steering. so when you are bouncing down the road and your trailer pushes down on the back, you effectively have less weight on the front wheels, and less traction and braking ability. On dry pavent not such a big deal, but in the rain, snow etc... this can make a huge different. Also almost all AWD vehicles do NOT have a locked center differential meaning you only actually have traction on one wheel at a time unless you have an LSD. with a 4x4 you lock the front and back giving you traction on one front and one rear wheel(again unless you have an LSD, posi, sure grip etc..) Some have a snow mode or something like that to temporarily lock or clutch te front and rear axles together...  This makes a huge difference when you are trying to tug your boat out of the water on a slippery, steep or gravel launch.  Can you do it? yah no doubt. you can pull your boat with a rav or any other small compact SUV. Is it entirely safe? Well thats really up to you to decide. For me, I always like to have more towing capacity than what I need."
687489,Grimace,2012-04-17 16:38:00,2020, Great point.   You don't want that Lund pushing your Rav4 around when you are on the brakes in a hurry.  Good luck with your choice and make sure you have some fun with the test drives.  It is always fun to watch the salesman squirm a bit.  :-)
687491,icefisherman,2012-04-17 16:41:00,952," Very good discussion so far...by the way my point remains...when the licensing body certifies a vehicle for 3500 lbs towing capacity I logically assume such vehicle can and should be able to tow up to that much. Under all normal road conditions and those include rain and snow... And organizations who certify them must be considering towing includes stopping as well....otherwise it doesn't make any sense...why would a vehicle be rated for 3500 lbs if it cannot tow that much or cannot stop with trailer behind that is that heavy. All I am trying to say is RAV4 V6 rated at 3500 lbs by the authorities MUST be able to tow AND stop with such weight behind. And  I am sure it is certified to do it in rain and snow (not that I'll be towing the boat in the snow;-) or slippery roads. Yes frequency of towing is the only thing that cannot be calculated in advance but as I said I don't do it that often or that far...   Jedimaster, RAV4 V6 trully is an amazing vehicle from what I've been reading about it over the last 5 years. It actually has that option. What Toyota calls Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC). Here is a quote I just found:  ...this compact crossover come available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive with a locking center differential. The optional all-wheel-drive system uses electronic control to send power rearward when slippage in front is detected, and it offers a lock that fixes the front/rear torque split at 50/50. This last feature should score the RAV4 high marks with the four-wheeling crowd as well as some true capability in slush, snow, and mud. Its improved stability (from its wider track) and smoother ride (from its longer wheelbase) make it, once again, top of its class, thanks to an all-new suspension and stiffer chassis."
687521,blarg,2012-04-17 17:40:00,289," Its rated maximum is not the same as what it can comfortably do, under ideal conditions it will likely do more, when those conditions are less than ideal the weight it can tow comfortably will be less, if you want something that can tow comfortably you want the tow rating of your vehicle to easily be able to handle the trailer.  If it stops only adequately on dry pavement, it will stop something less than that when its wet, if it does the job adequately on mild grades it will do less on steep hills, if the cooling system of the vehicle keeps up on the average day how will it do on a very hot day, long trip, uphills, etc etc.  You want headroom, you will in all likely hood be fine with something rated close to you trailer weight, but there may be times you wish you had more, I could be rated to bench press two hundred pounds, but its near my limit and it isnt easy, i can do 150  all day (kinda), rating me for 200 would be a little exaggerated.  My mini van pulled my trailer, but you could feel it, and it didnt stop easily, it didnt manage hills easily, it strained coming up the ramp, backing into my driveway, but it worked, just not easily/comfortably."
687522,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-17 17:46:00,10439, My vehicle is a little larger (Honda Pilot) than the Rav4 you're looking at but I can say that pulling my 18 footer is like it's not even there. My popup camper is another story but it's very near the towing limit of the vehicle while my boat is at about 50%. You definately know the camper is there but it pulls and stops fine. My vehicle has the same type of all wheel drive system including the center locking diff and the only thing you need to be aware of is you start off in front wheel drive and if the front tires start to slip it shifts some power to the rears. This is all fine and good and it works fine but you need to make sure you do your tire rotation. The reason is the little bit of slippage on the front before it brings in the rears tends to wear the fronts much more quickly than the rears. If you never rotate the fronts will be slicks before the rears show any wear at all. Just a little something you will need to be aware of.  One more thing to check is the Rav4's maximum tongue weight and the actual tongue weight of your trailer. My boat is well below the maximum but the camper is very close to maximum and it squats the rear pretty good even with after market air bags.  I think the Rav4 will be fine for your needs. IMHO
687524,Headhunter,2012-04-17 17:52:00,5703,"Or, you could consider moving closer to the Lake (LakeO)as that is where the majority of you fishing time is spent. I hear Oakville has some nice places! Good luck Emil... and one word of advice... just because the ""specs"" say something, doesn't necessarily mean that it will do it well!  HH"
687535,Fish4Eyes,2012-04-17 18:11:00,1022,"My 96 4Runner is rated to tow 5000lb. No chance in hell it could actually do it safely. My boat and motor MIGHT weigh only 1500lb and I really feel the boat on the back when towing and especially braking. I wont even get into when I have it loaded for camping.  icefisherman: we all know that keeping a safe distance should be practiced when trailering a boat and you will be ok driving mostly any vehicle, but consider yourself lucky that you have never had to brake suddenly and be required to come to a complete stop within a short distance. I don't know about others, but my truck sure as heck swerves to one side due to the weight of the trailer/boat when I brake hard (as light as it is). If your really stuck on the Rav4, get trailer brakes put on your trailer and your gold.  PS: friends of mine have a 4 cylinder rav4 and complain that it is a pig on gas, so ensure you inquire on a rav4 forum or something with regard to the realistic fuel economy. My buddy claims it wastes more than his 330 v6 bmw."

687555,jedimaster,2012-04-17 18:32:00,3472,"There is alot more to consider than just the towing capacity.. Curb weight 3677 lbs GVWR 4720 lbs  This leaves a payload of 1043 lbs  Your trailer is 3000 pounds, so yout tongue is 300 pounds. that leaves 700 pounds for your occupants and luggage. This puts right at the tip toe end of the rated GVWR...   Now another thing interesting to note is the GCWR. If a number is not explicitly specified it is assumed that the GCWR is The Curb weight plus the towing capacity. The payload is subtracted from the towing capacity. In other words you are not supposed to load the vehicle to the max GVWR and then tow the max Towing rating.  So if you  load a 1000 pounds in the car, your 3500 pounds is now 2500 pounds.  Interestingly I saw references to the GCWR for a V6 Rav being only 4950. Now you may ask yourself well it weighs 3600 pounds and the GCWR is 5000 pounds so that leaves only 1400 pounds for payload and trailer. How is this possible that it could have a towing capacity and curb weight higher than the GCWR... Well the answer is that the RAV is not designed to tow that much weight.  Anyway, be safe no matter what you drive or buy."

If your pushing the limits of your tow vehicle I would highly recommend a tranny cooler.....you can install it yourself for about $150......CHEAP tranny insurance....  On the stopping concerns.....just add electric brakes if you suddenly feel this new vehicle cannot handle the job......about $300  Or you can get a full size truck that will cost you more and more each time you fill up......if you go that route the Toyota Tundra is highly recommended by Billy Bob......

Tacoma GCVW is 8100 vs 4950 for the Rav.  If I understand you should be pulling much more than 1500lb.  Perhaps 3500lbs towing is with trailer brakes. Truck chasis can tow much more than car chasis.

687317,icefisherman,2012-04-17 02:28:00,952," I would love the Tacoma but am scared of the price tag even for a used one...  Couple years ago I almost bought the new (then) RAV4 6 cyl version...this is trully my dream SUV love the look of it....super sexy ;-))...amazing engine, great economy both loaded and not, perfect for in town....perfect for me all around....but those damn things NEVER EVER seem to go down in price even 2007 or 2008 are still well over $10K...but yes if I manage to find one of those at a good deal I'll be set for a looooong while ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
687333,kickingfrog,2012-04-17 03:25:00,8333,I was just reading an article about 2009 Toyota highlanders. That might be our next tow vehicle.
687337,blarg,2012-04-17 04:05:00,289,"I was pulling my boat with a mini van, it only weighs about 1800lbs all in, but the van definitely didnt like coming up the ramp or backing up the driveway, have a new ram now, i moved the boat last week and it was so odd backing up a small grade idling and not feeling it at all."
687338,cram,2012-04-17 04:09:00,1733,"Highlander - tow rating of 4900lbs, i believe.   Great vehicle in general."
687362,danbouck,2012-04-17 11:30:00,4380,I just got a 2012 Dodge Caravan for a tech at work and it's great on gas. It's completely loaded with tools and parts and currently sitting at 10.2L/100km. I was never a minivan fan but it's great. It has a 3600lb towing capacity.
687368,jedimaster,2012-04-17 11:57:00,3472,"Well to tow around 2900 pounds on a vehicle rated for 3500 pounds is stretching it. The suv's in the 3500pound towing range are generally car based suvs, with small trannies, no tranny oil cooler, small brakes and no real 4x4.If you tow your boat regularly ou will want the extra headroom provided by going above the 3500 pound (class 2) towing capacity. A Pathfinder is a fairly stout vehicle, so don't be mislead that because your pathfinder is rated for 3500 pounds any other vehicle rated for 3500 pounds will also work fine.  Be pracicle you are going to have to eat up he gas to pul that kind of weight safely. Don't forget you not onley need to get your boat to and from the lake safely you will also need to actually be ablt to pull it out of the water. and on a gravel ramp, an awd is not likely going to cut it.  I would say your top bet is a liberty diesle, or a truck of some sort, maybe a dakota quad cab, or a 1500 of brand X.I have always liked th tacomas but they had some major frame issues in the late 90's and got a bad name. These issues were resolved though."
687381,Fish Farmer,2012-04-17 12:53:00,2234,"You said you want a TRUCK SUV go all the way and by a Ford F150 Crew 4X4. Brian ""Misfish"" I thought you would have chimed in on this one??? Just yanking your chain bud, But I do like that Dodge Ram Laredo. Towing a boat and trying to save on gas, I don't think your going to win."
687383,Raf,2012-04-17 12:58:00,3495,get a v8 for towing.  my grand cherokee v8 gets better mileage towing (and on the highway not towing) than my previous 4.0L I6 regular cherokee did - it is slightly thirstier in town.  the v8 does not have to work as hard -- you're at the upper end of 6 cylinder towing limit which means they'll have to work pretty hard.
687385,BillM,2012-04-17 13:00:00,17367,"Towing and mileage really don't go together.  We get about 9mpg pulling the 5th wheel and the boat with my oldmans Duramax, can easily pull 15-16mpg with the boat only.  But that's way overkill for what you're looking for."
687386,Roy,2012-04-17 13:00:00,13728,My next one will be an 8 cyl. if they still make them by then.
687387,scugpg,2012-04-17 13:05:00,1373,Ford explorer v6 eco boost 4x4 if/when it comes out. Really nice looking ride and should be good in gas with the eco
687388,BillM,2012-04-17 13:10:00,17367, F150's with the EcoBoost have been a bust in the mileage department.  I doubt the Explorer will do much better.  Replace that silly V6 turbo gasser with a small displacement turbo diesel and then you'd see some nice mileage numbers
687426,icefisherman,2012-04-17 14:13:00,952,"Well guye appreciate all the input and opinions here...so far based on your suggestions and on my list of requirements it seems the three top choices are:  1) Toyota RAV4 V6 - no one has said anything bad about it. Glowing reviews everywhere. And I have been following this vehicle ever since it came out in 2006. Amazing top quality engine, 269 hp, and 246 lb-ft of torque. Very economical too...with about the same mileage (19 mpg city and 27 mpg highway) the 4 cyl has, but much much more powerful. Very good look (wife should be happy;-) 4WD so no problem pulling the boat at any ramp under any conditions. By the way I have never had issue with the Pathfinder in that department. With that motor and 35oo Lbs towing capacity I should be laughing pulling my boat and I bet it'll have much better economy than the Pathfinder. Only if I can find a good deal on one. Maybe from the US....as they seem much cheaper there though made next door in Woodstock.  2) Toyota Tacoma. Most of the above applies here as well. Very highly regarded vehicle...never had a truck before but if any this maybe the one I feel good about. Towing shouldn't be a problem with 5000 lbs towing capacity. And again I am sure the millage will be better than Pathfinder. Same applies here though - good finding a good deal on one.  3) May have to consider going back to Pathfinder or XTerra mainly because of the lower prices...hope they have improved their economy in the last 10 years though....  I have heard some horror stories about the Jeeps...good things about the Ford Trucks but it'll be a huge jump for me to go to that kind of a vehicle, not to mentioned it is US made...which is not that big of an attractant in my books...so...not much other choice left really....    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
687442,cityfisher,2012-04-17 14:34:00,959,id recommend my jeep but its a pig on gas.. its an 04 v8 limited... i get avg on the hwy 15l/100km .. NOT towing... towing my buddys ranger... 18l/100 on the hwy  100$ to drive to the cottage and back
687448,ratherboutdoors,2012-04-17 14:46:00,132,"I have had good luck with my Tundra, I pull an 8000lb fifth wheel.  You don't want to know how much fuel it goes through though.  My theory, what I save on repairs I spend on fuel... so far anyway!"
687453,cram,2012-04-17 14:58:00,1733,Does a Rav4 have the weight to tow a boat like that?
