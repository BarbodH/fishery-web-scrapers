I am hoping to do some fishing while I am there. Does anybody know what fish are available in this area?  A Google search indicates that there are brookies, bows, browns, and smallmouth in the river. It is a long river and I will be in lower section near where it flows into the Delaware so I am thinking that smallmouth would be more common than trout in this area."
