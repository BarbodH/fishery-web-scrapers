689143,vinnimon,2012-04-22 01:47:00,2593,Nice shooting Dave
689167,northernpike56,2012-04-22 02:26:00,717,nice fish! can you eat them in moderation out of lake ontario?
688551,Fish Farmer,2012-04-20 00:55:00,2234,Took my stepson out for a little fishin time this morning. Picked up 4 Browns this morning east of Grimsby plus one small Coho. 1 Brown missing in the pictures because of a big Lamprey hole in the side. All fish caught under 15 FTW   
688553,chris.brock,2012-04-20 00:59:00,4053,"nice looking, fat, healthy fish, way to go"
688556,Twocoda,2012-04-20 01:04:00,4130,Nice shootin FF....Guide service in the makin
688566,Fish Farmer,2012-04-20 01:22:00,2234,"Thanks Guys, Trolled by this place. I didn't want to get to close. "
688567,solopaddler,2012-04-20 01:28:00,8605,Nice Dave!
688570,Moosebunk,2012-04-20 01:31:00,3970,Great browns.  There such cool fish and the spring reports are always appreciated.
688571,Joeytier,2012-04-20 01:33:00,3990,Great fishing.   Those are all real chunky brownies to boot!
688572,dave524,2012-04-20 01:42:00,4508," Nice fish  , but a ""guide service""   he said he was east but the pics look like west of Grimsby .  Surprised the pier is so empty"
688578,Fish Farmer,2012-04-20 01:57:00,2234,"Hy, your good, no pulling the wool over your eyes  . I never thought of the back ground. Those pictures are west, almost to the rifle range. We had them in the live-well, my stepson wanted fish for the smoker plus his picture taken to show the boys at work. But to be honest we did catch them east of Grimsby"
688587,Leecher,2012-04-20 02:31:00,7832,Nice work Dave    Great looking brown   Congrats
688590,danc,2012-04-20 02:39:00,4677,They're very nice looking fish. Wish we had them up here. Good job Dave.
688592,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-20 02:39:00,2690,Beautiful!!  You guys are killing me  Can't wait to get out there again!
688593,dave524,2012-04-20 02:41:00,4508," To be honest, I've always found the area of the pics better for browns than east of Grimsby, maybe in a little tighter than the pics appear. Even shore casting there better than the now famous pier, the pier for me seems to have a lake trout jinx East seems to be better for spring kings though, out deeper than you find the browns though and look for structure."
688619,rocheleauc,2012-04-20 03:43:00,205,awesome
688624,misfish,2012-04-20 09:35:00,29133,Nice clean fish Dave.
