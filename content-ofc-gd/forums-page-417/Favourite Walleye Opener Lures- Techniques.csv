688014,robfrawley,2012-04-18 19:27:00,25,"Hey Guys,  Just wondering what everybodys favorite technique or lures for walleye opener are?  I'd have to say jointed cotton cordells and rapala countdown at night along island shorelines in one of my favourites.  During the day I'd have to say drifting chartreuse worm harnesses along deeper weedlines"
688030,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 19:58:00,5784,I'll be fishing with Dana at our walleye spot on opener... Most likely a jig and grub will be my go to. I have several fovortie gurb types as well as some new ones to try.
688041,johnnyb,2012-04-18 20:21:00,3413,For years I would troll original floating rapalas around....then started ripping jerkbaits around weedbeds....have to say it's a lot more exciting...although I still troll from spot to spot
688048,manitoubass2,2012-04-18 20:38:00,11391,"shakeyhead/worm combo, jig/grub, jig/minnow, or bass style spinnerbait  13 FOW on the west side of an island on NW Bay, Rainy Lake  I can already see it in my head, and it's magical!  We land 30 walleye over 30"", and everyone limits out on eaters.  I get home just as my girlfriend cracks open my beer and hands it to me  We enjoy some company/stories from the adventure, and after a few more cold beers and some fresh walleye, my lottery number hits and the pot is 30 million.  I'm so amped for opener!!!!"
688056,Rod Caster,2012-04-18 20:48:00,5784, This is my favorite post of yours! Haha good stuff
688259,mike rousseau,2012-04-19 06:15:00,4661,Jigging spoons during the day...  Trolling deep divers at night
688270,fishindevil,2012-04-19 10:19:00,6254,trolling one of my homemade worm harnesses over and around emerging weeds and shoals !!!
688296,Nipfisher,2012-04-19 12:06:00,2449,Drifting a jig/minnow across the rippled sand flats at the mouth of the French River. Trolling or drifting a chartruse in-line spinner tipped with a minnow. Taking some time to target Silver Bass in the Sturgeon River too.
688304,trapshooter,2012-04-19 12:20:00,1234,Lindy Rigging is tough to beat if the fish are a bit sluggish.  Otherwise I like pitching jigs tipped with minnows or 3-4 inch plastics.
688305,Harrison,2012-04-19 12:26:00,2202,"Rip Jiggin.  I can't wait, have the ice pack and A535 ready.  Always sore the eve of walleye opener, but I love getting fish rip jiggin.  Will video some of it this year."
688348,Targa01,2012-04-19 14:53:00,46,"Jigging rock piles and pitching jigs to shore lines, if the weather is ahead of schedule I like to pull bottom bouncers with harnesses or slow death, But in the cold weather nothing beats a jig tipped with a minnow."
688372,JoshS,2012-04-19 16:25:00,729,"Depends where you're fishing. I usually do a little better the following weeks after opener but this year might be sped up a little. I usually throw jigs like the rest.  I have good luck at night fishing grubs, swammers and shallow cranks too."
688446,jeffw,2012-04-19 21:33:00,267,mostly use the live target perch and if the fish are finicky then i will go with a jig and 2 twone berkley chartreuse grub
688542,superdad,2012-04-20 00:29:00,353,Fish high in the water column on the opening weekend for the large fish still there after the spawn.  Just my thoughts  David  aka  Superdad
688738,Dabluz,2012-04-20 17:09:00,701,"In my region, walleye opener is a the end of May.  I (and a bunch of others) will be fishing a bit upstream in one of the rivers that flows into the Lac St-Jean.  Water depth is from 10 to 1 feet.  Many use bottom bouncers with a crawler harness but I prefer using 1/4 ounce jigs baited with nightcrawler.  I've tried plastics and they just don't work for the walleye in my region.  If I do any trolling in the river where I go, I catch landlocked salmon and a few walleyes.  For trolling, it's any good minnow bait that does not go very deep or even large streamers on fly rod equipment.  The landlocks are in the fast flowing parts of the river where there is a maximum of 5 feet of water.  The walleye also frequent this part and their numbers increase as night starts to fall."
