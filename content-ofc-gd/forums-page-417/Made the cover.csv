686880,Homer Is King,2012-04-16 03:48:00,305,Your underwater photography is awesome!! I'm glad it's paying off for you!!
687181,misfish,2012-04-16 21:20:00,29133," Thanks for the offer Mike,but I dont want to jinx it."
687213,spincast,2012-04-16 22:40:00,3279,Very cool. Some nice Karma there
687216,ccmtcanada,2012-04-16 22:50:00,7971,"Mike...huge congrats are in order here!!!  Amazing news!  Hey everyone, I've fished with Mike...yep, the guy who's pics have been published!  Seriously though, your photos have always been amazing...this is very much deserved."
688631,Spiel,2012-04-20 10:24:00,9065,"Cool, and to think I knew him when he was just Mike."
688775,fishnsled,2012-04-20 19:21:00,3520,That's awesome! Congrats Mike!
688899,MJL,2012-04-21 01:27:00,2427,"Cheers and thanks again guys   Steve, I don't think there are any book stores or tackle shops in Canada that have a copy of it. One of the writers gave me this link where you can order the book online from the UK:  http://www.booksoncarp.co.uk/  Still waiting for my copy of the book to arrive (I'm guessing it should be in my hands in a couple weeks).  Mike"
686424,MJL,2012-04-14 18:54:00,2427,"Last summer I posted a carp fishing report with a few underwater pics. Someone out there spotted them and contacted me asking to use a couple for a book he wanted to publish. I didn’t think much of it but after a couple e-mails, a deal was made. 9 months later, who would’ve thought?     The fish in the picture was landed by Frozen-Fire using his 13’6” Diamondback float rod and centrepin...The hair rig in the picture was tied by yours truly so technically, that makes it my fish too    Pretty cool to say the least. I don’t have the book in my hands yet but I’m definitely looking forward to reading it when it makes it over from the UK. Contributing writers to the book (like Ken Townley) have been instrumental to the way I fish for carp myself - I've been reading his articles since I was 6.  Unlike one former fishing magazine editor on this forum, I didn’t splurge and buy a car.  I did buy a new underwater housing though...Hoping to take some timelapse pics of salmon & steelhead migrating up rivers as well as carp feeding close to shore    Cheers  Mike"
686427,misfish,2012-04-14 19:03:00,29133,"I was fishing with a famous angler,and I didnt even know it.  Well done Mike."
686429,Leecher,2012-04-14 19:07:00,7832,"That's just AMAZING Mike    With your writing & photography skills and not to mention your great knowledge of the species, it's no surprise to me to see you land that kind of deal  Congrats TE"

686659,tb4me,2012-04-15 17:35:00,3295,Awesome Mike! I hope you get a cut of the book sales!
686761,MJL,2012-04-15 21:58:00,2427,"Thanks guys   Not quite Dave...But I do have to admit that the guy on that cover page is one handsome looking fellow   Bill, Risk = Reward...Totally worth it! I've been watching various online vids on youtube for the Canon 1D X...That, along with perhaps the new 24-70mm f/2.8 II L would be the ULTIMATE combo to dunk"
686763,misfish,2012-04-15 22:03:00,29133," I fished with the famous one today. I didnt get an autograph,I just got to fish with another great angler."
686856,MJL,2012-04-16 02:11:00,2427," Brian, if you want an autograph, I can sign the new float stick that Spiel is building for you and he can epoxy right over it. It'll last forever that way"
686872,Photoz,2012-04-16 03:18:00,792,"Next we'll see a shot of you & Justin Beiber,on the front page of the Sun, with HIM holding your fish up! Where would a person pick up a copy of the book . . . .    it looks VERY interesting!"
