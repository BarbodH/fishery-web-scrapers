Obviously not asking where....just if it can be done successfully, or are all the fish out over deeper water most of the time.   Thanks."
686921,bigugli,2012-04-16 12:46:00,6138,There are a few night spots that produce.
686958,ccmtcanada,2012-04-16 14:47:00,7971, Yep there are    I've caught a few nice ones from shore
686978,Harrison,2012-04-16 15:26:00,2202," Pfft, what do you know... how about some proof buddy..."
687019,johnnyb,2012-04-16 16:56:00,3413,Was a fella who hooked one once.....came the closest to landing it that anyone ever has.....went by the name of Homer  
687112,northernpike56,2012-04-16 19:26:00,717,I've seen a guy and his daughter pull a 5-6 pounder out of hamilton harbour a few years ago from shore. Caught on a white spinnerbait. Me and my friend ended up landing it for them.
687113,Sinker,2012-04-16 19:29:00,8692,"It can be done, but you may have to spend a LOT of hours trying.  I've even caught small ones in my smelt net.  Night time is really your only chance, unless your fishing the pickering Nuke plant, and that's not happening from shore anymore. My PB came from shore there though!  Most of them are caught accidentally while fishing something else.  S."
687147,limeyangler,2012-04-16 20:30:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies, topic came up in conversation with a buddy...was just wondering."
687194,Joeytier,2012-04-16 21:51:00,3990,"Most deepwater bays [most bays with marinas] get decent numbers of them at times, but it's very hit or miss at best.  Some real big girls though!"
687203,Roy,2012-04-16 22:11:00,13728,"Piers would be the best places for night fishing and if you could find a wooden pier or two, bonus, you triple your chances. Slim baits such as Reefrunners and walk them all around the pier as though you were trolling. That'll be your best shot."
687438,ccmtcanada,2012-04-17 14:25:00,7971, Night time shore walleye proof...LOL 
687441,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-17 14:30:00,310,Funny that you mention this 'cause my buddy thought I was crazy when I'd walk crank baits along a pier... until I began to catch some eyes... then he was doing the same thing...
687450,Harrison,2012-04-17 14:50:00,2202," LOL, theres one of those monsters!"
688219,WeedLine,2012-04-19 02:04:00,322,"Like Sinker said, the nuke used to be great but no access anymore. Lots of piers and spots on Quinte and some great shore fishing on the south shore of Lake Ontario. Big ones around rivers and rivermouths in western New York. I think the season is open all year on the U.S. side"
688413,JoshS,2012-04-19 18:45:00,729,"You can probably do better towards the east end. I can't speak for the south but around the GTA is TOUGH!  I've heard of them being caught by the spit and have seen the MNR shock a few. They are always nice sized eyes but far and few in between.  I even thought I found a prime spawning ground this spring, went in with flashlights at night and could not see any golden eyes down there. I know there are a few spots on the TO islands where they spawn and they have been seen in rivers. Targeting them is still a mystery to me.."

688622,mike rousseau,2012-04-20 06:37:00,4661,I'd imagine some rivers dumping into lake O have walleye in the spring...  I know on the st.lawrence we have 2 different spawns...  1 in the tribs 1 on rock/gravel flats on the main river....  I'd think lake O has some trib spawn walleye...
688926,ehg,2012-04-21 02:57:00,2666,Just thought i would mention that the big walleye in my avatar was caught in western Lake Ontario. Was a cast length from shore but in a boat at the time. Big walleye from 15-20 lbs are swimming around out there but night time and lots of effort is a must for shallow Lake O estuary walleye.
688999,dave524,2012-04-21 14:39:00,4508,"Here's another big shorecaught L.O. eye, from a somewhat surprising location. Remember this one of a few years ago  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=37791"
689006,manitoubass2,2012-04-21 15:48:00,11391,"Anywhere there are walleye you will find them shallow this time of year.  So, IMO, if you can find the right structure or location, of course you can catch them from shore.  It's just gonna take a little bit of work.  and MM, I'd bet you are right on the money with your comments.  We also have lake walleye in the river at certain times of the year, and some remain in the river year round. No way to tell for certain, but I've always thought the color differences could tell part of that story."
