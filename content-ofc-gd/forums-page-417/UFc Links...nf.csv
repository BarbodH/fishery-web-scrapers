689185,woodenboater,2012-04-22 04:14:00,2277,reading liveblog on mmafighting and Rory's fight sounded insane. hope JBJ loses
689187,BillM,2012-04-22 04:38:00,17367,Rory absolutely destroyed him...  The main is a snoozefest.
689188,woodenboater,2012-04-22 04:54:00,2277,"It's been repeated ad nauseum everywhere but Jones should be made to jump a class. Yeah he may make weight for LHW but his body structure makes a huge difference where he is now. He wouldn't dominate if he was moved to HW which is where he really should be.  Was hoping Makdessi would've gotten the win but he was up against, who I thought in this fight, was a boring leg slapper."
