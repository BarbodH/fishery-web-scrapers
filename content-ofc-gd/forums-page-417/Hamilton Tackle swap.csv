688197,mercman,2012-04-19 01:11:00,7054,"I went to 2 local ones sponsored by Muskies Canada,this month, and there was some real good deals to be had.These swaps are great way to meet people and find some bargains and rare tackle."
688201,adempsey,2012-04-19 01:20:00,1498,I am guessing this is it?  
688203,hirk,2012-04-19 01:24:00,571,"Im going to have some tables there, you too bigugli with lots of jigs im guessing?"
688205,bigugli,2012-04-19 01:31:00,6138,"Jigs, harnesses and weights."
688209,Fish Farmer,2012-04-19 01:37:00,2234,I'll be there looking for a 40LB electric transom mount. Got a few new bait caster combos to sell.
688212,Jer_H,2012-04-19 01:45:00,25,Looks like a great place to find some deals.  Wish I was closer.
688397,Snidley,2012-04-19 17:46:00,620,"A buddy of mine is going and he has 2 tables with a ton of high end Japanese lures like Lucky Craft, Jackal, OSP etc as well as some mint G Loomis Steelhead rods. I'm going and hope someone is bringing some vintage Balsa crankbaits like Bagleys or some customs."
688401,cuzza,2012-04-19 17:57:00,467,Maybe a daft question - how big/busy is this event? I have to be in downtown Hamilton by 10 at the latest so will probably only have 30mins but I'd like to swing by for a quick look if I can.
688409,Snidley,2012-04-19 18:30:00,620,I heard last year was pretty good.
688706,I'mHooked,2012-04-20 14:38:00,525, Any salsas or sauces Bruce?  Thanks for pointing this out. Going to check it out and say hi.
688715,cynmar,2012-04-20 15:10:00,169,"Damn , this is the 2nd swap meet that I can't get to go to this weekend. Sometimes you hate owning a business. Was going to look for a good used C3. Crap  Bill:"
688722,cisco,2012-04-20 15:21:00,597,Going to be some good but inexpensive musky tackle and tackle holders there.

688741,misfish,2012-04-20 17:18:00,29133,"Looks like I,ll be there for door opening.See ya there."
688886,Handlebarz,2012-04-21 00:57:00,3790,Wish I could but would have to leave to early to get home before my daughters skating banquet. Hope everyone has a great time there is always next year.
688974,vinnimon,2012-04-21 12:34:00,2593,  Ive got one that fits a 32lb minkotta
689017,tknohpy,2012-04-21 16:24:00,162,"Went to the swap today, busy place!  Got a few of BigUgli's harnesses and an Eyecon rod for 80 bucks.  Lots of stuff to look at!"
689025,d_paluch,2012-04-21 17:10:00,343,I really wanted to go but had to work.  In the end it might have been a blessing...can't afford to spend anymore money for at least a few weeks  Might need to get in contact with someone who makes their own jigheads...I hate buying packs of 5 only to lose them in 1 outting
689030,misfish,2012-04-21 17:47:00,29133,"  Yep, some great deals if you dig through the boxes. Spent about 40 bucks for around 120 bucks worth. It,s a stop for me next year for sure.  Met up with a few members,Ciso,FF,Uncle buck,Jose,Hirk and Bruce. Cant wait to dig into the salsa."
689033,I'mHooked,2012-04-21 18:24:00,525," Figure I did about as well with about $100-$120 worth for about $40. Sorry Brian I couldn't be on your ""have met"" list as well!  At least I figured out which table was Bruce's Going to get into some of his 'Oh My' grade salsa tonight! (Good to meet you Bigugli!)  Definitely was worth the visit and some pretty good deals to be had."
689034,misfish,2012-04-21 18:31:00,29133,"If you seen a guy with a nascar AMP jacket on,it was me.LOL"
689079,tknohpy,2012-04-21 21:21:00,162,Bigugli had a ton of jigs for sale
689111,bigugli,2012-04-21 23:52:00,6138,What a great day. The swap meet was very busy.  So many familiar and new faces. Glad to have been able to have at least a few words with every one. Casey sure enjoyed all the attention and was plum tuckered out at the end of it all. Hope you guys enjoy the salsa  Thanks for making it a good day.
