108934,lew,2007-08-30 09:09:00,12767,"Prices are back up around 99Â¢......at least in Toronto  Gee, whatta coincidence that the prices jump again right in front of a long weekend.  Couldn't be price fixin though, cause we've got the assurance from our government that everything is on the up & up with the  thieves....er, oil companies....and they wouldn't lie to us.......would they ??"
108938,Rich Clemens,2007-08-30 10:21:00,3131,"Must be those Americans and their last official holiday of the summer.   Sorry Lew ... I'll stay home and keep the demand down    .   I haven't noticed the prices around here going up yet, but historically they do.  Hopefully they'll come back down again before I head to Ontario again in a couple weeks."
108948,Blake,2007-08-30 11:35:00,418,Gas is 96.9 down here.
108950,mcallister.grant,2007-08-30 11:40:00,327,Your right Lew.. I find it remarkable how apparently there is no correlation with the long weekend and gas prices going up... Yet several politicians warned of higher gas prices yesterday. Isn't it amazing how some of our politicians can forsee the rise in oil prices (which affects gas prices). Maybe they should be working on Bay St? It makes me ill!!
108961,rickster,2007-08-30 12:18:00,495,$1.12 here in the great northwest
108962,John,2007-08-30 12:19:00,2956,Both politicians and oil companies forecast a month ago that gas prices would be around $1.00 per litre by Labour Day.  Maybe this is a way for them to say that they gave us a break of $0.01 a litre!
108965,Mike the Pike,2007-08-30 12:35:00,3421,Yup gone up to $1.06 from 96 cents here.Every year labour day weekend we go camping and I have to pull my heavy tent trailer so the oil companies always make sure it cost's more to tow that weekend  CRIMINALS
109017,Beans,2007-08-30 14:02:00,3339,I filled up at $0.95.7 this morning...  I guess they nail you on Monday on the way back home...
109018,TennesseeGuy,2007-08-30 14:03:00,957,"Hey Rich, we're at $2.52 a gallon and it's cheaper in some places.  It's been holding there for about two weeks. Earlier in August I paid a lot more in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario."
109080,fishindevil,2007-08-30 18:02:00,6254,Yes that sucks ...they said it was going to stay down around the low 90's for a while as there was no hurricane threat in the gulf...  ...dam liars..  ..  its  $99.5 a liter here in Oshawa....
109085,English,2007-08-30 18:40:00,90,Up to 99p per Litre here some places are down as low as 96p but it is pretty much a level playing field with a country so small  Regards Clive
109091,Canuck2fan,2007-08-30 18:57:00,1444,I KNEW it I felt pretty good this morning when I saw the price at 98.7. I crammed in as much as the ole Neon would hold yesterday. I was ticked because when I was on my route in the company van I saw it for 93.5 but when I got back with my car it had gone up to 93.9.... Anyhow I all but jacked up the corner of the car to cram in 13.00 bucks worth LOL. I felt sorry for the guy driving the SUV in front of me in line his was 105.90 then he said forgot to fill the 3 x 5 gallon tanks he had for his lawn tractor and boat so he would be back to pay some more.... the 3 cars waiting for his spot at the pumps were not looking impressed either.
109099,Mike the Pike,2007-08-30 19:18:00,3421, Now its up to $1.11.Real thiefs i say.
109100,Zib,2007-08-30 19:20:00,369,Yet another way that the rich get to take money from the poor.
109120,pikehunter,2007-08-30 20:12:00,1659,"Gas stations, casinos, tackle shops...they all take our money. Too bad I can't avoid at least one of these places."
109122,Riparian,2007-08-30 20:16:00,269,"I gave up watching the prices of gas a long time ago and just accepted the fact that gasoline costs somewhere around a buck a litre. I got sick of trying so hard just to save a few bucks a tank.  Price gouging sucks, but I think gas should be expensive to aid in conservation and make people use less. Someday, we wont have that resource to complain about."
109155,Roy,2007-08-30 21:53:00,13728,The only thing that amazes me about this is that noone has started a gas boycott thread yet this week.
109239,holdfast,2007-08-31 03:23:00,1813,"Went up this morning from 1.09 to 112.  I was shocked as I heard nothing at all about it.  Obviously because of the long weeknd.  What bugs me is how we are programed to expect it and take it.  These hikes had no warning or no excuse for the reason,  Fantastic marketing."
109254,Riparian,2007-08-31 05:31:00,269,Thats price gouging for you. No reason except marketing.
109288,mgrieve,2007-08-31 12:59:00,20,"Governement won't do anything about it, cause they make a killling in taxes as well when the prices go up on long weekends!"
109292,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-31 13:03:00,698,"The gas companies get us conditioned to higher prices so when it goes ""down"" to 91cents we think we are getting a deal. A couple of years ago 91 was considered highway robbery. I wish they would invent a solar powered car with some power but the oil lobby will block innovation."
109336,Cheakamus,2007-08-31 15:58:00,6,"We never see it under a buck a litre out here on the left coast. Lowest I've seen recently is 1.01, but usually around 1.07 to 1.15. I was out in Bamfield last week and paid 1.40 a litre - not surprising considering how remote it is. Here's the ultimate solution to the high price of gas - if you can afford it in the first place  In the mean time I'm just happy to drive my prius past the pump..."
109337,rana,2007-08-31 16:08:00,13,Yes prices are high but that won't stop me to go  Have a marvelous long weekend everyone
