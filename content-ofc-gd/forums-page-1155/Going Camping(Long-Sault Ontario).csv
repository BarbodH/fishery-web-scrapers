We are off to Long-Sault Parkway campground in Ontario.You know that place where MJL gave that fabulous Carp report with his Dad.I was going to try my Luck at Carp but I won't bother since JPD our team mate on team #4 just caught us a 38 inch carp .Check it out in the Tourny section what a monster.I don't think I can top that one.  I am Limited to my canoe this weekend so hopefully I will have something to report and I will try very hard not to flip the canoe as I just replaced my camera that was toast when I flipped the 12 ft tinny.  We will be 12 couples with kids should be a grand time.My brother in law is itching to fish, also my 16 year old nephew and I have 2 new kids to introduce to fishing.Pan fish here we come.  Have a great and safe Long weekend everyone.  MTP"

109225,MJL,2007-08-31 02:23:00,2427,Good luck with your trip MTP. Hope you have as much fun that I certainly had.  It's always worth a few casts for those St. Lawrence carp.

109275,Crazyhook,2007-08-31 12:13:00,1154,"you better fish for carp when you are there, it would be like going to vegas and not playing a few rounds of black jack"
109283,Seaweed,2007-08-31 12:40:00,135,Good luck this weekend.  The area offers some great fishing.  The bridges have produced fish for years so don't be afraid to try from shore too.
109296,tonyb,2007-08-31 13:15:00,1637,You're going to Longsault and you're NOT fishing for Carp!???  I don't think there are any other fishing opportunities around there that can compare to the World Class carp fishing...you may want to reconsider  Tony
109344,Mike the Pike,2007-08-31 16:19:00,3421,Well I am outta here.Be safe everyone and have a great labour day weekend.  Mike the Pike
