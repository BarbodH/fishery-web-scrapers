How rough does it get in the harbour?  What winds should I avoid?  Just looking for some input to see if I should even consider it or not.  Thanks! Evan"
109315,Uncle Buck,2007-08-31 14:50:00,1000,"pick your days and you'll be fine... you'll probably want a bow mount if you're goin for largies...  in general if the lake is a mess, the harbour is fine, if the harbor is a mess, then the lake is fine..."
109316,evster,2007-08-31 14:56:00,367,"I don't have an electric so maybe I should choose somewhere else.  I am taking a friend out who hasn't been fishing in a while and using my bro's boat who lives in Beamsville so I was thinking either hamilton harbour or jordan harbour.  I might go to Jordan then if it is calm and drop the boat in at the launch by the beacon, is there a spot there to hand-bomb the boat in do you know?"
109330,Uncle Buck,2007-08-31 15:34:00,1000,"apparently jordan is only 3 feet deep... and it's full of weeds... i've never fished it, but a guy i talked to said it's not worth the time...  you could still fish hammy harbour even without a bowmount... it's not a necessity..."
109335,evster,2007-08-31 15:56:00,367,I've caught a couple decent fish in Jordan.  You just gotta put the bait right in it's face since there is no visibility in the water.
109345,pikehunter,2007-08-31 16:24:00,1659,"Just as Uncle Buck said.  The bay (harbour) can get nasty, just like any waterway can. A North, Northwest wind and LaSalle in Burlington is OK to launch from. Wind from the South, Southeast and Bayfront Park is a better bet.  If it is windy the waves in the bay can become quite steep, straight up and close together. Should be fine in your 14' if the conditions are decent, better if it isn't a shallow boat. I have been out there in a 12' and survived.  If you decide to go through the canal and out into the lake the passage trough can be very rough. The larger boats kick up big wakes and those guys   don't care about you in your small boat. The combination of incoming waves and the boat wakes and the resulting waves rebounding off the pier walls can be seriously terrifying.  Better wear dark pants and take a change of underwear with you!  Give it a try you can have a good day there.  Now Jordan Harbour I don't know, I have thought of it when driving past. I am fearful of launching in Lake O. and the wind turns around and then getting trapped all of a sudden in Jordan because of large waves. I know, I'm a chicken."
