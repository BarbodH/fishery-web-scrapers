I threw a bunch of lures out with nothing so decided to walk the river for a bit. Was still not getting anything so decided to put on the old red devil. After a few casts I get a hit and have a fish on. I figure it is a bass as always but instead it turns out to be this guy. Not exactly what I was expecting but still better than a skunking.  After that I went back to the pike spot but still nothing.Here is a couple more pics of their spot.   Anyway,will be out exploring the Nith on Saturday armed with the tips from my other post so hopefully I will have some pike pics on the weekend.Thanks again for the help."
109171,Rizzo,2007-08-30 23:27:00,4754,persistence will pay off...even if you have to get out the auger to get at those pike!
109173,Riparian,2007-08-30 23:33:00,269,Try drifting a frozen smelt along in the current...
109186,ccmtcanada,2007-08-31 00:40:00,7971,"Keep at em!  You'll get one eventually...like I said...it took me 5 straight days...fishing in daylight, sunset, dusk etc... before I got mine.  Good luck and good on you for getting out there!"
109191,Rizzo,2007-08-31 00:48:00,4754,"after reading a different thread, may I suggest a muskrat or other filthy rodent for bait?"
109201,fatherof3,2007-08-31 01:11:00,1769,"lol, saw that as well Rizzo.I think I will save that to try last"
109248,Mike the Pike,2007-08-31 04:35:00,3421,Hey man hang in there try throwing your lures near some weeds.Use some suspending rapalas and try the pause technique.Twitch side to side and pause 4 to 5 seconds.Try some mepps and even white tubes.Do the time and the pike will be prime.Good luck.  MTP
109265,fatherof3,2007-08-31 09:09:00,1769,"Thanks for the encouragement.MTP, where I saw these 2 there are no weeds but there is a large,submerged tree branch running along the bridge support and lots of rocks on the other side with an open channel in the middle. I figure they are around the branch.For sure will hang in there as I have not caught a pike for years.I am going to get some new lures today and walk the river.I will get them,lol"
