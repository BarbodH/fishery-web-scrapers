Ive heard salmon were caught all the way up to angus, but I went there and the water looks dead. Is that how the notty always looks in that area?   Hoping for a response from some tonight, hoping to hook into some fish tommorow.     If anyone has any other fishing reccomendations for the area that would be cool too   Feel free to PM me   Also how is the access to the river in the provincial park   peace   Mike"
109456,glen,2007-08-31 22:57:00,2641,Fish are there all you have to do is catch them.  The river runs right though the park so lots of places to fish.  Good luck and post a report.
