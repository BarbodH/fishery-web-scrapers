109504,danbouck,2007-09-01 03:23:00,4380,I need to replace the thermostat on my outboard. Can I run without one for a short period of time? Is it going to damage anything?
109508,didoban,2007-09-01 03:35:00,65,better to install a replacement when you remove it.  but it can run without it but u will not get temp/optimum performance ur motor is designed to run...
109515,danbouck,2007-09-01 04:09:00,4380,It's just that it's an old Chrysler and the parts are impossible to find and I'm going to Temagami next week for a couple weeks so I don't want to cancel it because of this problem.
109520,banger,2007-09-01 04:25:00,95,"IMO It can be run.But it won't run great.It will never get to the operating temp, needed to run smoothly.ANd it will be hard on gas. Was the old one totally screwed. You could test it, in a pot of boiling water.Just watch it untill the spring opens.If it does'nt open, then she's toast!.    I would try hard to find one, but I would'nt cancel my trip. Maybe bring it into CT or Nappa, and try to match it up.You might get lucky, you never know.   Good luck.  Shawn."

109526,danbouck,2007-09-01 11:09:00,4380,"Thanks Guys, I will give Nichol's Marine a call. Yes the old one was completely screwed when I did the boiling water test."
