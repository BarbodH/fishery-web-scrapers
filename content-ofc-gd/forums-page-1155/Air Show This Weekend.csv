109016,HIMTI,2007-08-30 13:58:00,33,Have a look at the lineup.... F-22 Raptor is coming. Fishes will be spooked...so dont fish Lake Ontario waters this weekend...LOL.  http://www.cias.org/lineup.html
109019,lew,2007-08-30 14:03:00,12767,The Mustang has always been a very impressive plane in my mind..  It played a huge role in turning the tides in our favour during WW11
109039,blaque,2007-08-30 14:39:00,2419,"Is it worth the 2 hour ride to come check out from the states. Or is it just a major ZOO and ill be stuck in traffic and butts to sweaty elbows all day. Ive been wanting to come up for it for years, but a week in rushford lake for years has always overlapped that weekend. No rushford this year so im free and looking to come check the show"
109042,bigbuck,2007-08-30 14:47:00,2449,"It's a great show, you can go spend a couple of hours at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) then head over to see the airshow, consult the schedule to make sure you see the planes you want. I've been a few times and the power of the military jets never ceases to amaze me. 9 years ago a buddy and myself met the aircrew of the USAF F-16C that was there and we had a chance to get up close and personal with the plane (I have pics of me in the cockpit with the canopy down). Post 911, I don't think you'd get a chance to get within 100 metres of the flightline."
109045,bowshep,2007-08-30 14:54:00,378,"All depends on if your tall then someones elbow is on your bum. lol   Its a free event in Toronto. People will be stopped on the side of the highway, the transit will be packed. With a clear sky and warm temps it will be great l cant wait to hear the raw power and the sight of them dissapearing into the horizon hehehehehehehehehehe lm so   ""Off we go into the wild blue yonder. Off we go into the sky"" Peace Ken"
109053,HIMTI,2007-08-30 15:26:00,33,"I agree with BigBuck. The show starts at 1pm....so you should come in a couple of hours early. enjoy the rides at CNE and then head over to the lake. Not that much push and shove , its alright."
109070,blaque,2007-08-30 17:13:00,2419,"Yeah, i just want to see those fighter jets buzzin somewhat close up. Ive never been too close to a jet fighter whizzin around and imagine its gotta be pretty sweet.  ever been to an NHRA drag event?........those top fuel funny cars rattle your eye balls when they go down the track. I love things that are loud fast and obnoxious LOL!! (i see some comments coming my way after saying that lol)"
109177,malonzi,2007-08-31 00:03:00,5,"My dad's been to every show since the mid-sixties, I've been there every year from from the time I was in a stroller and I'll be there this weekend for the 29th time.  Political views on military, war, etc. aside, it is amazing to see how powerful those jets are.  The only thing that can top it is seeing the space shuttle launch (seen that too, you're about 7 miles away and it shakes you body from the inside out).  Check out the show if you can, it's free but if you drive down parking will be around $25."
109187,Clampet,2007-08-31 00:40:00,1947,"One of dem Jets buzzed over the house around 7:15 PM (Britannia Rd in Mississauga), and trust me it was loud.  Made the cat run in the house, from outside."
109255,lickmyarmpit,2007-08-31 05:48:00,359,Those f-16's were buzzing around alot today I work right by the airport in brampton saw them doing manuevers.  Very cool wonder what its like to fly one!
