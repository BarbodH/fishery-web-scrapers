108286,Jay T,2007-08-28 14:14:00,282,I wish I could get this right the first time lol.

108315,fish_finder,2007-08-28 15:29:00,370,"Hey all, I'm kinda new here....been lurking for a while though.  Thats a nice spot you've got there outdoorsman.  Please, keep it secret.  I've been up here for the last 2 decades, and each year there is more and more garbage to pick up from the slobs that end up there.  Its bad enough with all the new signs and all!  Good luck out there.....further downstream I nailed a 18"" Brown last year....released.  Dave"

109257,Stern Rules,2007-08-31 06:03:00,342,Nice to see brookies being caught in Ontario. I'm only used to them in New Brunswick.  Their fun to catch no matter how small.
