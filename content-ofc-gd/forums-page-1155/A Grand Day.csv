Was trying for catfish and had no luck so finally tried my worm rig with a Gulp and got this beauty, my biggest ever and the only thing I caught. And by the way, the Dream Theater show the day before at the Amphitheatre was totally awesome. Video is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbB_iGSqK0Y  "

109256,Stern Rules,2007-08-31 05:54:00,342,"Kennyman and Smitty, I believe it was around 16 inches, can't remember. Just remember it was about 3 1/2 lbs. I got it on one of those samples I got of Gulp 3 years ago and haven't used yet. I was a green worm and was getting pretty hard but managed to get it on the hook.  Thought it was snagged at first but then it moved. Video is here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbB_iGSqK0Y"
