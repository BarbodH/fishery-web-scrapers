108771,fishdawg,2007-08-29 21:19:00,912,"I remember somebody called out somene for posting the same message on ""mulitble boards"" before"
108784,Corey,2007-08-29 21:55:00,355,"You know guys... Steve catches fish, and is always willing to help other people catch fish. If you ask him where on Erie to catch fish, he'll point you in the right direction no questions asked.  He posts pretty much weekly with what is being caught and usually with what they are catching fish on, yet all we hear from some people is spam spam spam.  Why don't we just enjoy the posts and pics from someone who is dedicated their whole life to fishing and does it pretty much everyday.  It's funny how other professional guides who post reports on here always get a pat on the back, even though they have all their ""contact info"" in their signatures.  Really guys... stop all the fricken whining and go out and catch some fish. I think some of you are just jealous personally.  cd."
108803,Dondorfish,2007-08-29 22:40:00,1000,Ya - what Corey said. He is always the first to give tips for Lake Erie and Ontario. I personally do not feel this is spam - I love to read his posts.  Keep up the good work Fishmaster! Look forward to your next report   Don
108825,PatrickGG,2007-08-29 23:45:00,562,Is it me or does anyone here see the guy with the corona t-shirt holding a Walleye with bugged out eyes?  The 7th pic down from the top.
108838,Roy,2007-08-30 00:02:00,13728,"Depending upon where you put your fingers under the gill plate, it's easy to bug their eyes out. Those fish aren't being released so I guess it doesn't matter. Good catch."
108864,fishindevil,2007-08-30 01:03:00,6254,"WOW !!!!!!  right on steve...thats what i call goin walleye fishing...lol..lol.  . looks like some real nice erie eyes great pics as welland you can tell in a few pics she was rough out there,and some happy customers....dont worry steve we dont think you are spamming.they obviously dont know you..thats bull.  .anyway thanks for sharing,man i would love to get down there and fish with you someday soon...i cant wait in a few weeks to go to quinte, there is a great catch of resident fish ....take care ...cheers"
