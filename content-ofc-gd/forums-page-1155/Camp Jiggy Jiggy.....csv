108675,wallyboss,2007-08-29 15:57:00,1095,"The movie that you were showing was it a home movie, cause those tracks sure look like big ones!!! Or you were watching Jurrasic Park!!!!!"
108677,TJQ,2007-08-29 16:15:00,7806,Yup.. it was Jurassic park!!!
108679,bbog,2007-08-29 16:18:00,665,Great pics and post - a place many would die for (me included).
108680,TJQ,2007-08-29 16:23:00,7806,I gotta say.... we looked for a long time before stumbling upon this property in the Dignam Catalog - http://www.dignam.com/  The property came available in March and there was no way to get in to see it during break up so we bought it unseen.  we took a risk but it turned out great... I imagine that as we get older the urge to finish the road in there will become greater... but for now 4 wheeling in is fine.   The whole time weve been up there we have seen three boats total come our way.
108683,bowshep,2007-08-29 16:33:00,378,Thats a slick Redneck Hilton. Peace Ken

109334,Cheakamus,2007-08-31 15:50:00,6,"Hey Cuz! Great report on the camp. We'll have to plan a trip out there next year. I like to see y'all are drinking martinis at camp  Also looks like you had some good pocket pool action going on in your ""favourite position""   Heh... Anyway the Chinooks and Coho are stacking up at the mouth of the Cap. Hasn't rained in a while so the river's low. Planning to head out tomorrow with the bro to see if we can hook into a few. Landed a couple of Pink's off Cate's Park two weeks ago on trout gear. Give the wife and kids hugs from us. 18 years. Good thing you're so ""hot""."

I guess people have to stop saying you never catch anything...I see you caught a baby bass there...hehe.  Good on Grandma to outfish everyone with the big fishes for the weekend too!  Happy belated anniversary to you and Monique...and also happy birthday to Avery as well.
108599,Spiel,2007-08-29 12:03:00,9065,"....Congratulations on dat der anniversary thing. Fine, fine women you got there boss who's willing to spend it working and relaxing in a bush camp.  And the camp's looking great as are those fish. Guess I shouldn't be surprised that it took a 77 year old women to show you where the big ""eyes"" be hiding."
108601,Smokey,2007-08-29 12:04:00,1278,"Looking great TJ. Will be nice during hunting season, bird season is not far off now. Have you seen any other big game there yet?"
108604,Bitsmith2k,2007-08-29 12:23:00,396,congrats on 18yrs... i'd kill for a place like that..
108611,oldphart,2007-08-29 12:41:00,665,"~~~fantastic report, and Pics~~~Talk about hammar handles, more like wood splinters"
108645,TJQ,2007-08-29 13:58:00,7806,"Thanks for the congrats everyone, I have no idea why she put up with me for so long, must be my good looks ....  Its a 4 km quad drive in, most of the rpoad is old logging road and in great shape, the last 700m is trail I widened, pretty rough.  Ive seen plenty of Moose tracks at camp, and deer as well, though I don't think there is a deer season there.  Theres a bear or two around as well.. lol... thats a fact.  There is plenty of small pike and bass, Ive caught some nice big bass and a few decent pike, theres no shortage of fish, but finding the bigger ones is proving to be a challenge. Theres rapids above and below the camp, I wonder how much migration there is, ie how far up and down do the fish range??  I drove behind a family of 5 partridge on the road in that were two stupid to get off .. lol.. it was pretty funny.  Last year I didn't see very many during the summer and last fall the hunting was fantastic, Ive been seeing alot this year so I'm hoping that with the very mild winter we had last year, it will be even better!  We spent alot of time there this summer, which was the plan, I still have to upgrade the crapper, (sorry Roy porcelain id just about outta the question....)  and I want to put a nice shower room/sauna in,  theres nothing like a shower/sauna at camp.  As for the fishing, I generally don't get a chance, when the kids and/or grandma are in the boat I'm usually the driver/guide/fish remover...  OTHERWISE I'D SHOW 'EM!!!!  Interestingly enough the pickeral was caught on my favorite lucky strike spoon, which I though was odd... we've still fished/jigged for them without much luck... now I know the big ones are in there.... oh boy.. look out!!  Im anxious to got back up on the 15th for partrdge opening, and check out the game camera I set up to see if what I think is hapening..is happening!!  "
108650,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-29 14:10:00,0,Looks like the camp is coming along fine! Congrats to your Grandma for the nice pickeral!
