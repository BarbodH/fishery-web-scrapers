109270,Corey,2007-08-31 10:09:00,355,Tell me that's not just a waist strap around him as a safety harness?
109302,chilli,2007-08-31 13:32:00,199,No there's a 5 point safety harness on him as well (black with grey tether). He can't fall or stand up. Problem is if he has to go NOW!!! he's going to have to get the stand wet
109397,Corey,2007-08-31 20:03:00,355,Good stuff... I am going to be picking up a crossbow soon... I can't wait for my week in Dec. but until then I am gonna crossbow it.
