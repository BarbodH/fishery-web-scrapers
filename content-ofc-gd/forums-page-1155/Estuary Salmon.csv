Wasn't overly optimisic (it's usually better at night this time of year), but did manage one decent fish on a fire tiger Mepps Cyclops spoon. What a rush, that fish took off on several long blistering runs and took at least 20 mins. to subdue....  Here's the fish boiling shortly after the hookset   Couple of action shots    Beaching it...   Got it!   For those that are considering the night shift the next couple of nights should be very good. There was tons of fish rolling in the lake just beyond casting range...  cheers,  Mike"

Now that was a rush...try brining in a nice salmon while trying to make sure your chair, cooler, net and tackle box do not blow away."
