Plan to hit some beaches and kid friendly attractions. Planning to leave from Markham on Saturday morning and perhaps stay the night up there before returning Sunday.  Anyone have any suggestions on where to stop for activities? Any shore fishing spots for panfish would be nice for the kids. Please PM me.  Some considerations so far:  1. Owen Sound has a salmon derby going on and they have a weigh in tent set up with a fish fry (so I've been told).  2. Grey Roots (something like Pioneer village).  3. Sauble Falls beach.  4. Bruce Trail light houses and rock beaches.  5. Tobermory (maybe, likely not)   Thanks,  HearingFish"
