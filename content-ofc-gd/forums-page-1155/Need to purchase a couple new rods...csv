108721,Gerritt,2007-08-29 18:59:00,6129,"Well... the title pretty much sums it up..  I need to purchase a couple of trolling rods, something that can handle dipsey's etc..  Anyone know of a half decent rod within a resonable budget?  Looking forward to your advice!  Gerritt."
108723,Joey,2007-08-29 19:04:00,9122,"Yes Gerritt, the Pete Maina Combo's are great and don't cost very much.  We use them on Quinte and for Salmon.  They are at BPS.  Joey"
108726,Raf,2007-08-29 19:09:00,3495,"shimano tdrs, cabela's depthmaster are examples of dipsey rods that don't break the bank.  I don't know what the bps house brand is.  you don't need anything fancy."
108735,Roy,2007-08-29 19:36:00,13728,For that application I'd go TDR as well. Prolly could pick them up around $35 now.
108736,ccmtcanada,2007-08-29 19:38:00,7971,Gerritt...not sure if you've checked out the classified section yet...but this is on there....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=10416
108737,Gerritt,2007-08-29 19:38:00,6129,Thanks guys! I will swing by BPS next week as I need to grab some marine carpet as well.. Thanks again!  Gerritt.
108738,mcallister.grant,2007-08-29 19:58:00,327,"Hey Gerritt,  Is there anything I should grab?  Grant"
108740,PERCHER,2007-08-29 20:06:00,787,"Dont forget BIG crank baits.Like Stretchman 20s,or 30s,big Walleye divers and even some nice size spoons.Planner boards and even some keel weights or clip on wiegths."
108742,SlowPoke,2007-08-29 20:20:00,2984,Cheap linecounter dipsy setup... Daiwa Heartland 8' Dipsy rod with a Daiwa Accudepth PLUS will run you around $100. The Accudepth PLUS model is leaps and bounds better than the old Accudepth reel. The Heartland rods are an excellent value. -Brian
108765,fishdawg,2007-08-29 21:08:00,912,"I agree   Heartland & TDRs are reasonably priced & bullet proof The Accudepths & Okuma Magdas will do the job, but if your gonna do a little more trolling then just 2 trips a year to Quinte,  do yourself a favor & get Convectors or Sealine linecounters - speaking from experience"
108787,Jeff R,2007-08-29 22:05:00,94,Are Shakespeare's any good? never used them...not sure what the reel was....cruised into LeBaron's today to start getting an idea of what I'll need and they had a couple of combos for $40-$50. just wondering if I'll get what I pay for...hate to cut a weeknd short because of junk
108794,Gerritt,2007-08-29 22:19:00,6129,  follow the seasoned Quinte veteran advice... I know I will be!
108795,Gerritt,2007-08-29 22:20:00,6129,  any colours to look for?  I will look at linecounters as well.  Thanks guys!  Gerritt.
108806,Mike the Pike,2007-08-29 22:47:00,3421,You need planer boards for sure.MTP
108856,Gerritt,2007-08-30 00:35:00,6129,OK Planer boards for sure.... is there any other way of mounting them without a mast? as you guys can tell... this is all new for me...  Gerritt.
108863,Tybo,2007-08-30 00:52:00,1373,"Gerritt, In line boards with flags. They attach toyour line. No need for a mast. Flags take the guess work out. The TDR's are a great rod for the price."
108869,fishindevil,2007-08-30 01:19:00,6254,"Gerritt,the guys got everything covered...i sent you a pm about some stuff you need,as well make sure you get at least 2 in-line boards,if they are the offshore brand there is a left and a right....as well as a selection of snap-weights,they are a must,and if you get the precision trolling book,it will give you dive curves and for how much line gets certain lures to what depth...its amazing,make sure you get your reels spooled up with 10lb trilene clear big-game with at least a 25ft flouro leader,its a deadly combination thats what pound test the book uses for all the lures...its the 8th edition...i can show you some other things once we get to merland park as well....cheers"
108871,Gerritt,2007-08-30 01:23:00,6129,  Holy crap... I think I am getting in over my head.. LOL... Thanks Shawn!  Ok... my shopping List...  TDR rods.. Clamp on Rod Holders Planer Boards Assorted Lures Snap Weights Fluoro 10lb Trilene   Basspro does not know what is going to hit them!  Gerritt.
108879,Tybo,2007-08-30 01:32:00,1373,If you 're going to run divers. I would get 17# test. I run 30# on the real big divers.
109389,Jen,2007-08-31 19:08:00,833, Don't forget those planer boards have a left and a right and you may want a worm harness or two!  Sounds like too much fun planning this!  Calling Easton tonight!  Cheers  Jen
