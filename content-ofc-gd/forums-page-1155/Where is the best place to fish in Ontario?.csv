108932,myst,2007-08-30 06:24:00,57,"Hi, I'm new to these forums, been fishing for many years but far from an expert. Me and a couple of my buddies are looking to go on a weekend fishing trip a few weeks from now, and I was wondering if you guys could suggest some of the best spots with the biggest fish.  I live in Ottawa and we are willing to drive pretty far. We will also need to rent a boat.  Thanks in advance for your help!"
108933,motv8tr,2007-08-30 06:29:00,2587,"Welcome to the board, hope you enjoy it, as for your question...What kind of fish do you want?  From what I understand you can get some good sized fish in your own backyard.  I don't know from personal experience but I hear BOQ is excellent, West Arm of Lake Nippising is a good place, there are in fact too many to mention.  If you read a few of the reports from the others you'll get a good idea. I  Maureen"
108940,Rich Clemens,2007-08-30 10:24:00,3131,"I hear the Ottawa River west of you has some very nice, trophy-sized Musky.  Just make sure you have the proper gear for catching, handling, and releasing them.   West Arm and West Bay has some great fishing with a variety of species to keep you occupied.  Please forgive me:   Welcome to the board.  Don't forget to post a report and some pics following your trip.  We'd love to share your outing."
108947,Blake,2007-08-30 11:34:00,418,Welcome to the board.  BOQ or even Rice Lake would be a great trip with fishing for bass and walleye.  Quinte will be better for numbers and size of almost all species.  You could also look at going out on a charter with someone to get on some big eyes on BOQ.  Have a great trip.
108953,mcallister.grant,2007-08-30 11:46:00,327,"I agree with BOQ. If you're coming down in a few weeks; it may be a little early for the big eyes. I would recommend the Kawartha Lake region. Many different species, decent size and scenic. Good luck!"
108966,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-30 12:36:00,2585,"your in a pretty decent area already with the ottawa river!  but the bay of quinte, st larence river, rideau lakes.   your only a couple hours drive to algonquin park!  Lots to choice from!  Good luck!  Cheers!"
108970,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-30 12:41:00,698,Welcome to the board. I think if you haven't fished in Ontario before and have a little extra money it is worth it to hire an experienced guide. They know all the spots and what works.
108973,Raf,2007-08-30 12:45:00,3495,Anywhere but your couch and OFC.
109007,joonmoon,2007-08-30 13:40:00,528,West Arm Nippissing......   South Shore Nippissing.....   Kawarthas.....   Dunnville......    Nakina.......    Orangeville.......    French River......    Anywhere there is water is a good place to fish...lol
109008,BLACKFISH88,2007-08-30 13:42:00,191,BOQ!!!
109030,TJQ,2007-08-30 14:24:00,7806,It also depends on what you want... less population - more population... 5 star lodging - el cheapo camping......

109076,fishindevil,2007-08-30 17:53:00,6254,OTTAWA RIVER.....amazing & awesome!!!!!!!.  ..cheers
109098,Canuck2fan,2007-08-30 19:17:00,1444,"Welcome to the board. A question like that has NO right answer. It is kind of like asking who is hotter Jessica Alba, Scarlett Johansson, or Meagen Fox. Seriously what guy wouldn't have the time of his life on a fishing trip with any or all 3 of them? The fishing in Ontario is so varied, and so are the spots for catching most species.  I know one thing for sure though if you tell the folks on here what kind of fish you hope to go after you will probably get about a 100 different answers on what works best and where to go LOL."
109102,Zib,2007-08-30 19:22:00,369,The BEST place to fish in Ontario is Lake St. Clair.
109251,Mike the Pike,2007-08-31 04:46:00,3421, Yup I agree the Bay of Quinte.  MTP
