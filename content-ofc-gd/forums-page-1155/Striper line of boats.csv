I'm looking around the 20-21ft. range for various reasons and thought they looked appealing. Any year or history to avoid or any comparables? New is out of the price range so thought a good used might do. Thanks!"

109293,Seaweed,2007-08-31 13:05:00,135,Stripers are good boats for sure but check out the Nitro center-console and the Triumph also... they are the same type of boat and might be a bit less $$?  Only downside to this type of boat is that you have limited space for guests to sit on the boat.
109307,tipupesox,2007-08-31 14:08:00,167,"I researched the Striper boats before settling on a Starcraft Islander.  Being from the states I nearly purchased one from a delaer around the Turkey Point area, I want to say Durham was the town.  The 21ft. Striper/walk around cuddy model was $10,000 cheaper than one I could purchase in the states, year end close out.  Only draw back is it had a Johnson FICHT outboard, which had a ton of service issues.  I enojoy the Islander but would of much rather had the Striper, just could not justify the cost.  I have fished with a gentlemen that owns one, very deep and seaworthy boat, the boat does have limited sitting in the cockpit area.  I assume this could be resolved by adding a cooler with a seated cushin top, same as a jump seat."
