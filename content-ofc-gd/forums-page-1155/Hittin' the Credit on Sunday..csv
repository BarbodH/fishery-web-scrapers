I'm in town this weekend and am heading down to the credit from about 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.  Does anybody know if it's been crowding up yet?  Also, I'd love to have some company if anyone is interested!  I've got the long handled net and all necessary lures/spoons!  Cheers, UF"

109061,The Urban Fisherman,2007-08-30 15:58:00,2050, Sleep is for the weak Snag!  I usually fish those hours because my fiance can't complain that I'm not spending time with her and my daughter - sometimes I even make them breakfast when I get home to really butter up the situation! Keeps her happy and keeps me fishing!  Have a good one dude!  Ryan
