Got 9 Rainbows but only one keeper, the action was steady but only little ones were biting for the most part.  Picked up a Fenwick ice rod, med-heavy and put a Rapala R-Type on it with 6lb ice line. Worked like a charm!    2nd lake was walleye, got 3 smaller ones during the day and surprisingly the night bite was non existent. Never had that spot not have a really insane night bite before, wonder why!  Was also the first run on a skidoo I picked up, a 470 BRP Safari, 1992 but in excellent shape. Good enough to get me in to the back lakes and out again. Pretty much all I will be using it for.  Nice day out except for the rain that started around 1:30 and lasted for about 4 hrs. Going to have a frozen solid Frabill hut in the morning   "
892798,Joeytier,2015-01-19 02:16:00,3990,"Good job!  What were you using for the rainbows?  I'm always curious since my winter success has been limited for them...  That sounds like a nice sled.  Those 470 liquids were really fast motors, could wipe the floor with 500 and 550 fanners, lets see a pic!  I just got my 90 Safari 377 rebuilt, love it!"

892805,muskymatt,2015-01-19 02:38:00,2608,"It was well maintained, runs awesome. I'm going to baby it as it's only a one purpose machine....in and out of the back lakes. I have a Frabill 2 man hut with a tow bar and it follows along quite nicely.  "
892811,muskymatt,2015-01-19 03:30:00,2608,"For rainbows on this particular lake I was using a bait hook, small not sure which size with a 2'-2.5"" red dace minnow.  I have a splitshot about 12"" above the minnow which is hooked parallel to the spinal cord mid way on the back.  I also use a white scented micro jig which works well."
