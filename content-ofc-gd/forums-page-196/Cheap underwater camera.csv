892005,Freshtrax,2015-01-13 21:34:00,2215,I would like to get some downrigger footage this year but I am nervous putting a 300 dollar camera on the end of a downrigger cable.   Anyone seen anything else out there on the market other than go pro?  I guess I could shop used.   I don't need the real time like an strikecam. I just want to be able to view it when I get home.
892042,moose,2015-01-14 00:24:00,266,picked up a vivitar  at Canadian tire for 49.99 same as gopro
892050,Freshtrax,2015-01-14 00:43:00,2215,I was looking at that but it was only rated for 3m  underwater I think.    I need at least 60 or so ft.
892154,John Bacon,2015-01-14 18:29:00,3277,I got a Muvi brand camera from AirMiles points.  It is the same concept as GoPro just a different brand.  I have not tried mounting on a down rigger; but the case is rated for 60 metres or so; so it could be done.  I am not sure what the cost would be to buy one.  I have also seen some cheaper ones from Canadian Tire; I am not sure out depth ratings for them.
892186,dwc67,2015-01-14 23:42:00,140,it's not cheap but this is what you want. run your release behind it  http://www.waterwolfhd.com/en/#thecamera

Came with the waterproof housing, a couple mounts and the usual connections.  used a groupon deal to get it for $50.00 It works great for his purposes, although the battery life is limited, and it only has an internal battery.  I wouldn't go with the model I got G, but the  1080 resolution model looks workable. If you can get a spare battery with it, and the remote,  might be worthwhile. http://www.amazon.com/Pyle-PSCHD90BK-Hi-Res-Action-Camera/dp/B00I33XD96"
