I'm going to keep it very short and just share the photos. Lots of big walleye were caught this season, I fished mostly Horwood and Ivanhoe with a couple trips to Kenogamissi. Near the end of the summer I decided to upgrade from my 14 ft lund fury to a 18 ft Tracker Targa 1900 which will help me out next season when I join the Walleye Trail.  Here are some pics to sum up this year. For anybody that want's info on fishing around Timmins feel free to post here or message me and I can help out as much as I can!!"

Shining tree was a blast but, lottsa smaller walleye.  I'll be seeking info for accomodations etc as we get closer to open water.  Thanx"
