892511,ketchenany,2015-01-16 23:43:00,3229,"I don't think so, it was FREE registration. I believe it was only to track you if you did not remove your hut by the given day. if it was at the bottom of the lake or it burned, which a few did!"

892513,misfish,2015-01-16 23:58:00,29133,"I would like to have a perm hut again. Take the kiddies out where they will be warm and comfortable. The problem is dealing with the ones that feel the need to break into them and damage it. Thats the draw back for me. Nothing like having a small house on the hard water where you can take your coat off,put a pot of coffee on and do some fishing. Start to heat up the pan for a fresh fish fry for lunch.  Just might giver another go.  Thanks for the thread e."
