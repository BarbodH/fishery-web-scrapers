891135,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-08 19:39:00,4399,"I to bought a 2008 Uplander, no complaints, got it for $14,500 couldn't beat the price, kids loved it, lots of room I hope you paid 14,500 for it in 2008...."
891155,John Bacon,2015-01-08 21:01:00,3277,I think the Chrysler vans are the only ones were both the 2nd and 3rd row seats fold down into the floor.  The 3rd row folds down in most other brands but the 2nd row would have to be removed and stored if you want use the cargo space.  That would be a big selling point for me.  My dad drove Chrysler minivans from about 1986 to about 2012.  He never had any major issues.
891214,xxgoaler,2015-01-09 02:06:00,106,"I hope you paid 14,500 for it in 2008.... That's exactly what I paid, through in the extra's and a $500 gas card , tried to get the roof rack thrown in , but they couldn't do it."
891229,craigdritchie,2015-01-09 02:42:00,1586,"As you said Mike, all manufacturers have their pros and cons ... people who love them and people who hate them.  At the end of the day, it's a vehicle ... which means it will only depreciate and lose value. Unless you can think of a legitimate reason to do otherwise, spend the least you can get away with, and save your cash for things that will actually hold their value or appreciate."
891258,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-09 04:33:00,4399,good advice there.
891262,mike rousseau,2015-01-09 06:00:00,4661, But the wife wants a few options...  And I can't blame her cause she is responsible for the kids 6/7 days of the week... Nor can I argue with MY boat parked in the driveway...lol  Hopefully we can get the base with a couple extras thrown in or something...  We are checking ford Chevy and dodge this weekend...
891459,huzzsaba,2015-01-10 17:00:00,884,"I own a 2004 Volvo xc90, and it has been great.  Nothing different as far as maintenance than others, and gas mileage is similar to a minivan.  If you find a trustworthy mechanic who specializes in Volvos, or can do the work yourself, then they are not at all expensive.  I have worked on many cars, and they are by far the easiest to work on.  they are uncomparable in the snow, seat 7, and they can tow quite a bit and plenty of cargo space.  If you would like to look at them, then I would strongly suggest a 2006 xc90 2.5t with lower mileage. Stay away from any T6 models.  You will never have to worry about having a rusted car, as they don't rust.   Out of the rest of the bunch, I would suggest the Ford Flex.  I think they are pretty roomy, and gotta love the styling."
891463,Steve,2015-01-10 17:25:00,2075,"ugh,  ford flex.  we had five of us in that thing (the stretch version at that) to head from hamilton to montreal for my bachelor party.  not a comfortable drive at all.  i bought my suburban shortly afterwards....wish I had it for that trip."
891464,manitoubass2,2015-01-10 17:25:00,11391,the only thing missing on a ford flex is the wood panelling hahaha.  nice on the inside but ugly as hell.  i still say check out a traverse. waaay more functional
891465,fishing n autograph,2015-01-10 17:28:00,2540,"I have a Honda odyssey and bought it used. My van was a lease out and the first owner took care of it. I've put probably 100,000kms on it and not one problem with it other than wear and tear. We love it. Buy used if you need a van"
891472,huzzsaba,2015-01-10 18:15:00,884,"it may be nice to some and ugly to others.  Personally I like the styling  of the Ford Flex (I guess I like the boxy style since I'm a Volvo guy lol) and the fact that it has quite lot of trunk space compared to other crossovers.  For sure you cannot beat cargo space and roominess of the traverse or Acadia.  if I was in the market for one of those, I would go straight for the Enclave."
891474,msp,2015-01-10 18:34:00,1336,We had a 2002 caravan for years problem free. Lasted till 320k. Stated to rust out pretty good and was having a hard time starting. We did lots of research on various minivans and decided on a 2007 Toyota Sienna. It drove great for about a year and then we blew the tranny $3800 later. The van has been great. In hindsight we should have gone with the caravan again. Good luck with your search

Lol  And turns out now that my company was purchased by walmart... And I now work for part of walmart... I get some kind of special deal... I haven't talked to the dealer to see what the special deal is yet... Maybe discount... Maybe free add ons... BONUS!
891968,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-13 14:50:00,4399,"There is a long list of companies that get special discounts...you will basically get preferred invoice price and dont forget you still get what current factory incentives are on as well, essentially you get the vehicle at a little above cost. You have to get a control number and fill out some paperwork someone in your company should know about this."
891038,mike rousseau,2015-01-08 05:36:00,4661,Hello  So the wife and I are just starting to shop around for a new or slightly used van for the family... The G6 isn't cutting it anymore...  In no way do I wanna start and brand battle on here with negative arguing between everyone... That won't help me at all...  I'm looking for your feedback about the van or vans you have owned and what you liked or didn't like in your opinion...  I have no preference of brand... All brands have issues in their line up somewhere...  So please... Good or bad I like to hear about your personal experience and opinions on your vans...   Thanks a lot for the help...  Mike
891050,ecmilley,2015-01-08 12:06:00,2163,When it comes to mini vans tough to beat the quality of toyota or honda but you pay for it. That being said.the chrysler vans are inexpensive but you n ciyld buy a new canada value package for $22k with a 3.6v6 and the difference in money buys lots of repairs . Gonna have to drive em though everyone is a.little different
891051,lew,2015-01-08 12:15:00,12766,"When it comes to mini vans tough to beat the quality of toyota or honda but you pay for it.   Never owned one but have driven the Honda vans a few times and must admit, their pretty darned nice.  My daughter is on her 3rd Honda Civic and it's a very solid and well built car and I'd guess the van would be as good."
891057,DanD,2015-01-08 12:50:00,2223,"Like you said, everyone of the manufacturers have issues with their vehicles; some big, some with annoying repeat visits to the dealer for upgrades or reprogramming. What I've been telling my customers is, road test as many as you can; once you've narrowed it down to a couple of maybes; research the crap out of them. If you've found issues with the vehicle you've researched, go talk to the service manager of that vehicle's dealership and ask if that issue has been resolved. Don't ask the salesperson; they're there to tell you what you want to hear. Warranties and what they cover, would be the first thing I'd check into; today's vehicles are rolling computers and we all know about the strange things computers can do without warning. Maybe think of a 3 or 5 year (Dependent on warranty length) lease; then flip it back for another new vehicle at the end of the lease period? Yes you'll pay a bit more but you'll never be paying for repairs; like you would owning, once out of warranty.  Dan."
891058,BillM,2015-01-08 12:57:00,17367,"Definitely pick up a used minivan and let someone else take that 30% depreciation hit..  Toyota, Honda, Chrysler really can't go wrong.  You can get them loaded with pretty much everything."

Mike There are forums for just about every vehicle out there Mike as well as Edmunds, Consumer Report(theres a fee to join) and kelley blue book that point out year to year and generational model issues, recalls,TSB's, fixes and so on and so forth. Theres a www. of info out there to help refine and/or further confuse you.  One thing to remember is that with changes in plant relocation and off shore manufacturing of parts, especially after 2009, newer vehicle quality has in most cases become suspect across the brand market so you might want to consider an extended warranty no matter your choice.  Good luck in your search."

I did the regular maintenance and have had no engine or trany problems. There have been other repairs but where reasonable considering the kms.

It was the top of the line loaded and we took that thing on many family trips and at first it was my wife's daily vehicle and then it became mine as much as I did not like the thought of driving a mini van I drove it till it did not make any sense to even fix the brakes. When I finished my basement the things that we put into that thing to haul back and forth was crazy, the space was really nice to have when we need it.  FLEX"

I have a 2009 now with 200k and again no problem other than reg maintance of tires, oil and breaks. Both vehicles were bought 3year old American off lease. I found that to be the best value around. I've driven the new Chrysler and it's very nice but I'd worry about the money id put into it down the road. Hondas a great but top price in the class range. My next vs will be another Sienna"

No complaints really but we bought it used and the under rusted badly fast.  We replaced that with a 2008 Montana. Again nice vehicle. only fit 7 though so that sucked. Used it for abit with no issues.  Then we bought a 2011 chevy traverse and it is awesome! not a mini van but worth checking out. gets good mileage, all wheel drive, tow package, and it fits all of us. Believe it or not it has more room then a mini van. fully loaded with 8 of us in we can still load in my sons hockey gear and get a few groceries"

I get about 500km per tank, it rides like a Town Car  and has virtually every bell and whistle you can ask for!
