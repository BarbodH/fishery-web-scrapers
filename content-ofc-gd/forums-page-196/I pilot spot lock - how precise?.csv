892630,landry,2015-01-17 22:02:00,1005,Debating adding this to my V2. How have people with the V2 liked the I pilot feature. How accurate do u find the spotlock feature and what other features do u use often and like? Thanks Landry

892769,grt1,2015-01-18 23:45:00,638,"i have a terrova with the I pilot and use the spot lock all the time. just love it . it doesn't hold you completely in the same spot but I would say it keeps you in a 20 foot radius of where you set it. seem to triangulate and if you watch your gps, the display should show you how you move about. I just love it and if you can adapt it to your motor, go for it."
892782,fishdawg,2015-01-19 00:51:00,912,love it especially for perch fishing deep water... funny watching other boats using anchors as they slowly drift/drag past us while we hold our position
892784,Terry,2015-01-19 00:55:00,14456,"i am interested too, I can't try mine till spring"
892785,Dan668,2015-01-19 01:02:00,1120,Mine works good. If its not real windy it does a great job.  Only concern is noise.
892793,landry,2015-01-19 01:53:00,1005,Pork pie- I appreciated your response. Thanks
892807,Lape0019,2015-01-19 02:50:00,647,I did a lot of research in this before buying my terrova. Minnkota states it will hold you within a 5ft diameter of where you turn it on.  Here is a video.  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/i-Pilot/ it's about halfway down the page.
892826,landry,2015-01-19 05:20:00,1005,Thanks everyone. Gonna add it to my V2 or just save up and switch to a Terrova next year.
892840,BillM,2015-01-19 13:46:00,17367,Save up for the Terrova.
892843,AKRISONER,2015-01-19 14:17:00,5558,"i use it constantly, the only dowfall is that when the wind is really ripping, the head can get over twisted when it is constantly trying to make corrections. I love it though when I am cruising close to reefs or shoreline. Ill be tossing baits out and get a hit or a miss, hit the anchor button and boom im right back on the fish"
892855,RickOnt,2015-01-19 16:39:00,669,"Spot Lock on the Terrova is the ""Best""  Works as advertised.  Just make sure your forward motion has stopped before hitting the ""Spot Lock""  With the boat moving forward the Terrova turns backwards in search of the ""Spot"" and will get you going in a zig zag pattern  Terry   You will love it for deep water jigging.   No more dealing with 150 feet of anchor rode!!!  Makes moving a whole lot easier  Terrova is very easy to deploy and stow,  Also with the I Pilot on the Terrova you can use either the remote keyfob or the foot pedal"
892860,BillM,2015-01-19 16:46:00,17367,"Yup, also the Terrova will 'unwrap' itself if it starts to go more then 360 degrees."
892875,bare foot wader,2015-01-19 17:57:00,1354,"I wouldn't say my terrova keeps me within 5', especially not windy days, but it is an awesome feature/awesome motor"
892882,Lape0019,2015-01-19 18:29:00,647,On windy days it may be a bit more than five feet but not much. I overpowered my boat when I upgraded the TM so it holds pretty good once it figures out the drift pattern.  I just provided what Minnkota states and nothing more.
892884,bare foot wader,2015-01-19 18:34:00,1354,"yep, just sharing what my experience was  I would also recommend a kipawa prop for anybody regardless of make of trolling motor, the best $50 I ever spent on the boat"
892895,RickOnt,2015-01-19 19:27:00,669," re AKRISONERS post      ""the head can get over twisted""   As Bill said It should unwrap itself   "
892902,AKRISONER,2015-01-19 20:09:00,5558,"Yup, also the Terrova will 'unwrap' itself if it starts to go more then 360 degrees.  is this a terrova exclusive feature?"
892918,aplumma,2015-01-19 21:19:00,6896, is this a terrova exclusive feature? No the xi5 is also made with anchor lock it is rated as being better than the Minn Kota however it is all about what brand you like. The xi5 should be considered as it can also be linked to a lowrance HD2 or newer unit. This also comes with a wireless foot control as well as a hand fob. With the link up with the Lowrance you can plot a course and it will navigate the plotted course.  I researched it and upgraded to the xi5 because of the support and features that are now and in the future possible with the lowrance  motorguide union.   Art
892923,landry,2015-01-19 21:24:00,1005,I may just save up for the Terrova as I have added a transducer and cable to mine which will likely snap of it spins too much!???
