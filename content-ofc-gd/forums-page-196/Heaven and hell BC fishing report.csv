We went to Quesnel lake BC in late July. We had problems with the trip right from the start. It was a bit of a gamble to take my 80 year old mom across the country to a remote BC fishing camp. My mom is losing her eyesight and wanted the opportunity to go back to Rockies 50 years later...[VIDEO]"
891638,scuro2,2015-01-11 18:09:00,904,"The canoe in the pic came from the Polley lake campsite.Lake Quesnel is a 100 km long interior BC lake known as a trophy rainbow lake. High season may well start with the August holiday weekend when the first of hundreds of thousands of spawning salmon return back to this watershed. Up the lake at Elyssia resort all the best cabins were rented. Tragically on this holiday Monday in the early hours of the morning, Imperial Metals huge tailings pond collapsed. Seventeen million cubic meters of water, more then the the equivalent of 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, along with 8 million cubic meters of potentially toxic effluent roared down Hazeltine creek. What may have saved the lives of campers asleep on Polly lake just a 1/2 km away was that the tidal wave of slurry made a sharp right hand turn away from Polley lake sparing it of most of the effulent. Even so runoff from the collapse raised the level of Polley lake 5 ft. Even from 10 km away Likely residents could hear the roaring of effluent which continued to scour the creek bed down to Quensel lake. The 4 ft wide creek was now a 150 ft wide torrent of frothing brown liquid. This continued for hours into the later part of the morning. The force of that much liquid snapped large trees in half and blew out two bridges. Communication of the disaster happened by word of mouth and did not happen in an orderly way. Employees on site first phoning relatives. Some town residents only found out about the disaster through the media.When the disaster occurred we had just returned from BC and couldn't initially make sense of the news reports about Mount Polley lake near Likely BC. As we saw the news reports and referenced that information to what we knew of that area we were stunned to learn the lake we had just fished was now contaminated. Even so I probably would have put this in the memory banks except that the very people who locals were to trust were not believable. How could that much pollution not show up on the Ministry of the Environment's tests for drinking water quality? Welcome to Mine friendly BC.Three days after the disaster B.C. Premier Christy Clark met with Likely residents concerned for their water safety. She said the chief medical health officer would be making the decisions about whether the water is safe for residents to drink...""Everybody across British Columbia, our hearts are with you. This is a pristine resource for everybody, but for nobody more than you. And I know it's just been a terrible, terrible heartache. We are going to be with you, shoulder to shoulder, to do everything we can to return it to the real pristine beauty we all know this lake is for our province, because this is just such an incredible, incredible asset and so important to all of you."" Clark shared the initial water quality test results which showed no contamination.Four days after the disaster, B.C. Environment Minister Mary Polak announced the second set of water-quality testing results. The samples were taken on the 2nd day after the disaster at five different locations along the Quesnel River, to determine potential impacts on drinking water quality and aquatic life.  Jennifer McGuire, also with the ministry, said there was still no expectation that aquatic life would be impacted by cadmium levels. ""We do feel comfortable in the context of risk for human health rescinding the order (in those areas),"" said Corneil. ""It meets the Canadian drinking water standards, as well as standards for potable drinking water in multiple systems."" ""Analysis of these samples indicate that none of the chemical and physical parameter concentrations exceeded B.C. or Health Canada drinking water guidelines,"" said a memo that was distributed with the results.  All tests showed little to no contamination. At the time I wrote, ""I am at a loss about the testing. Results for the 5th are in. The (second day) results still looks relatively really good. They have taken the drinking ban off for Likely....How do you have that much sediment flow into a lake and not see it in any form of the testing? Things like turbidity or suspended solids"". That's right, the MoE removed the drinking ban for the town of Likely 4 days after the disaster.I decided to check for myself. Looking at the MoE's results the original two days of tests occurred approximately 7 km or more away from where the slurry entered the water and only 6 samples were taken. All initially reported testing was done near the surface. More startling to discover a week later was that the MoE tested near Hazeltine creek at different depth levels during the first two days but chose not to release these results! Those results especially below the water surface exceeded provincial standards. One can not help but be highly cynical that how the government handled this was no mistake. If you don't test where the containment will most likely be is it any surprise that the results would show little to worry about. Ten days later a lot of the contaminated water would have flowed down the Fraser river or would be settling on the bottom of the lake. Out of sight, out of mind, out of the news cycle. But water movement is counter intuitive especially on such a big wind swept lake.The claim that the drinking water was safe was as bogus as the initial claim that a majority of the contaminants had been contained by a log jam at the mouth of the Hazeltine creek. Less then two weeks after the disaster the MoE stated, After today, the province will no longer be providing daily updates on the Mount Polley tailings pond breach in Likely. The people and businesses in the area are “on the road to recovery.” We were to also learn that the spill was 70% bigger then first estimated. Cloudy plumes began surfacing on the lake. Further testing results began showing elevated level of contaminants. A water ban came back into effect and then residents of Likely were told once again not to drink cloudy water. Some slurry particles are no bigger then a micron. Bacteria is about two micron's wide. The naked eye can't see anything under 40 microns wide yet cloudy water was the sole criteria to determine if water was safe to drink? Also while the water within the tailings pond was neutral your stomach is acidic. Can the MoE state with any authority that slurry granules containing these chemicals ( Manganese, Copper, Vanadium, Cobalt, Antimony, Arsenic, Lead, Selenium, Cadmium, and Mercury ) pose no health risk to ingested? The Engineer of Record for the Mount Polley Mine, Knight Piésold, describes itself as the ""former engineer of record of the tailings storage facility at Mount Polley,"" and said that it informed Imperial that it would no longer continue in that role as of February 2011. Knight Piésold commented that during the time it acted as engineer of record, the tailings storage facility at Mount Polley ""operated safely and as it was designed,"" and was subjected to multiple third-party reviews. The firm said that since Feb. 10, 2011, it ""has not had any responsibility or knowledge of any aspects of the design, modifications or performance monitoring of the tailings storage facility at Mount Polley. The original engineering done by Knight Piésold Ltd. accommodated a significantly lower water volume than the tailings storage facility reportedly held at the time of the breach. Significant engineering and design changes were made subsequent to our involvement, such that the tailings storage facility can no longer be considered a Knight Piésold Ltd. design.Upon completing all assignments as the engineer of record in 2010, Knight Piésold wrote to Mount Polley Mining Corp. and to the Government of British Columbia’s Chief Inspector of Mines and stated that ‘the embankments and the overall tailings impoundment are getting large and it is extremely important that they be monitored, constructed and operated properly to prevent problems in the future.’ A formal handover of design, construction and monitoring responsibilities was conducted on March 8, 2011, when AMEC Earth and Environmental was acknowledged as the new engineer of record for all future work at the Mount Polley tailings storage facility."" And the final washing of the hands: ""Knight Piésold Ltd. is not familiar with, and therefore cannot comment on, the details of the incident, or on the design, construction, operations, water-management practices or any other aspects of the Mount Polley tailings storage facility.""The University of Victoria’s Environmental Law Centre warned in 2012 that environmental assessment certificates for mines issued by government are often “vague and unenforceable.” It said that by 2008 the number of mine inspections had fallen to half what they were in 2001. Small wonder — Ministry of Environment staff shrank by 25 per cent. The chief mining inspector said he had insufficient staff to complete the annual mine monitoring reports required. “This ramshackle enforcement regime is not good enough for an industry that can create environmental and financial catastrophes,” the study said.The president of Imperial Metals, Brian Kynoch stated the water is close to drinking water but the silt is the issue. A summary of material dumped into the tailings pond last year was filed with Environment Canada. It said there was 326 tonnes of nickel, over 400,000 kilograms of arsenic, 177,000 kilograms of lead and 18,400 tonnes of copper and its compounds placed in the pond last year. Mercury has not been detected in the water and arsenic levels are 1/5th of that of drinking water. According to Kynoch the water is not toxic to rainbow trout. The water use ban was apparently more to ""Err on the side of caution"" than a requirement...""Yes, I would drink the water, but it's of no consequence,"" the company head replied. ""I would drink the water once the solids come out.""In a news release the MoE stated, ""Often areas where mines are located have elevated levels of metals, meaning naturally occurring metal concentrations are often much greater in this region than elsewhere in the province. ""Scientific evidence tells us that the metals are not likely to readily move from the sediment into the water, and are therefore not likely to present a risk to future water quality,"" it said. Leachability tests, to be conducted in the next few days, should confirm this. Interior Health continues to assess sample results provided by the ministry for any potential human health risks. These results provide further reassurance to the decision to partially rescind the ""Do Not Use"" to the impact zone involving Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek and a small part of Quesnel Lake"".With Imperial Metals and the tailings pond, what was put in tailings pond is the rock that has been ground down to get at the metals. The left over material is finer then sand and is mixed with the water and other chemicals used in the extraction process. When they talk about toxins within the pond, these toxins are not in liquid form but bound to tiny granules. Leaching happens when the acidity within the environment strips toxins away from the granules. No one really knows about the degree of potential health impacts of such large scale contamination, and if any of the contaminants will leach into the water over longer periods of time or be absorbed by other methods into the food chain. Lake Quesnel has become one giant science experiment.Skeed Borkowski runs the Northern Lights fly fishing lodge on lake Quesnel. He comments, they killed my beautiful lake. “They can’t take those toxins out,” he said. “They’ll dissipate. They’ll disappear. But I will never, ever, ever drink out of this lake again. You couldn’t convince me. But the reality of it is, we don’t even know what’s going to happen to this. And the unknown is what’ll keep people from coming here. If you had the choice would you want to take your kids swimming here?”. The attached link below contains an interview with Skeed.http://www.desmog.ca/2014/08/26/last-cast-northern-lights-lodge-dims-early-after-mount-polley-mine-spill  Imperial Metals does not have a cleanup plan for the lake, or know whether it will be necessary. To determine what needs to be done in Quesnel Lake, the company is awaiting results from its consultant Tetra Tech EBA, which has a 37-foot research boat on the lake carrying out bottom sampling and water testing, Robertson said. Tetra Tech EBA is part of a coterie of consultants — including SNC Lavalin and Golder Associates — hired by Imperial Metals to work on a cleanup plan.The B.C. Ministry of the Environment has ordered the Mount Polley mine northeast of Williams Lake, B.C. to stop discharging effluent into Hazeltine Creek. The provincial order comes only a day after (Sept 8th) residents said they witnessed slurry being pumped from Polley Lake near the mine downstream into Hazeltine Creek and Quesnel Lake. In an emailed statement, the environment ministry says it also witnessed the tailings pond effluent being discharged into Hazeltine Creek during an inspection Sept. 4. The province says the mine has not discharged any more slurry into the creek since then and it has ordered the company not to do so in the future.Energy Minister Bill Bennett said he has authorized the company to start repairs so that the dam can hold back water resulting from the snow and ice thaw next spring. As much as two to three million cubic meters of water is expected, according to the company. “It doesn’t authorize them to reopen or begin to put tailings in that pond,” said Bennett. “That obviously would not happen until we have our investigation reports back. The government has three investigative reports due into the collapse, which could be done as early as January. Imperial Metals started rehabilitation and also guarded the disaster zone based on the local state of emergency. Many were outraged that they couldn't visit the disaster area. On Dec 4th the Cariboo Regional District (CRD) has rescinded the State of Local Emergency declared in Electoral Area F, the Likely Community Area.Imperial Metals does not believe it will make sense to remove sediment and tailings from the creek, an expensive proposition that the company says could create more damage. The company’s belief is predicated on its position that the tailings are relatively benign and will not produce acid that would release heavy metals into the environment. While the rock that has been milled in its mine does contain acid-generating pyrite, the acid-generating potential is neutralized by the significant amount of carbonate in the rock, says Robertson. “It’s the same thing when you think of your stomach acid and Tums. Well, we don’t have one Tums, we have a whole box of Tums — so it’s a very, very neutralizing environment,” he said.MPMC ordered 900 25kg bags of fast germinating grasses, which have been applied to exposed areas in an effort to provide vegetative cover. A specialty equipped helicopter was brought to the site to help with the task of seeding exposed areas. MPMC has seeded the entire TSF, which was previously covered by water, the exposed areas downstream of Polley Lake and throughout the Hazeltine Creek channel, except the canyon where the seeds would not be expected to germinate. While the fall season is approaching, we expect to get germination soon. The seeds have already started to germinated. We will monitor the seeded areas follow the progress of the vegetative cover. A pic near Likely around xmas, since turnover the water has been cloudy.Premier Christy Clark: ""Things looked bleak in Likely when the Mount Polley tailing dam breached. This was a tragedy – one I am determined to make sure is never repeated. But the response, bringing together my team with the Cariboo Regional District, local First Nations, and residents, showed what we can do when we work together to get a community back on its feet.""Williams Lake has been through some ups and downs. But the work ethic, perseverance and spirit of its people will be on display to the world again when the second season of Timber Kings hits HGTV, reaching millions of viewers. And odds are good Stampede will set another attendance record next summer.""An expert panel examining the disaster received a 47-page UVic law centre report — entitled Not an Act of God which raises concerns about the role of government oversight and the B.C. government’s reliance on professionals who are employed by the mine to conduct inspections. The report, authored by UVic law students, said it was important the panel “recognize that engineering design, mining operations and regulatory oversight issues are not merely questions of physical causation but occur within a legal and regulatory context that govern behaviour.” The report said a key problem is the B.C. government relies on the expertise and diligence of professional engineers to inspect and report, but gives them no power or authority to require that the mining operation make changes. The report said the problem is compounded by a lack of timely followup by government. It pointed to the lack of action on fixing dam instrumentation and problems with dam construction at Mount Polley raised in inspection reports between 2008 and 2010. “There needs to be a legally effective mechanism for these recommendations to be followed; failure to do so should have a legal consequence and should be considered non-compliance,” said the report. The UVic law centre recommended following the example of oversight at contaminated sights, where a roster of qualified people appointed by government, and at arm’s length of the companies, conduct inspections and reports."

891880,RDR,2015-01-12 23:46:00,125,"Nice report scuro!  Beyond sad, best describes what has happened there. I spent some time in the early 80's in that exact area. A great part of ""OUR"" country has been lost and who in government or business really gives a damn? Very bad news for every living thing in that once beautiful area.......  Thanks for taking the time to share the before and after. Those are some beauty fish!!!"
891918,scuro2,2015-01-13 03:08:00,904,"First off...this was bad but may be not as bad as some of you think. The few fish that died with the spill probably didn't die of the toxins within the tailings pond. They were not in liquid form but rather in a naturalized form...more further down.I am giving some thought to visiting the lake again this summer to support that community but also to see for myself how things are. Luckily the spill into Lake Quesnel was near the outflowof the lake. Still, who knows what percentage of contaminants have been washed down the Fraser river. What is know is that large a plume was sitting well under the surface of lake and now is finally clearly visible with lake turnover. I'm sure that those in charge were counting on most of it to be sucked down river before appropriate water testing was put into place and they probably thought their plan was a success...out of sight out of mind. But as the good fishermen amongst you know, underwater wind currents do the exact opposite of what you think they will do.The toxins are in a neutral and natural form within particles some being smaller then bacteria...floating throughout the water column and who knows how far up this 100 km lake. What happens when those particles enter gills or your stomach? What happens when plants absorb them? Who can state anything with certainty? My brother who is hydrologist agrees that this is like a huge science experiment without a thesis statement. My guess is that next summer things will be a lot like they were this summer except there will be less tourists. Perhaps you will see the odd cloudy plume. From the lake Hazeltine creek may even look normal to the outsider. Personally I don't think I'll living off of fish for my week visit or chugging lake water.One thing that should have never have happened was the BULL offered up by the company and the MoE. Get in front of the problem honestly so that the public sees that you as trustworthy. Do your best to fully acknowledge the problem by being totally transparent and getting the best people in to assess if your people don't have the skills. Then solve it to the best of your ability. Too late for that now and the end result is a divided community with what appears to be a ""move-on"" ""pro-mine"" majority and a minority who rightly has no trust in those in charge and wants real answers. As we have already seen Imperial Metals states it is afraid to remove the contaminants along the creek and on the lake bottom. Personally I believe that is because it will cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to do a good job. Luckily there are a few outside players like a UBC research station on the lake who may offer to be a voice of reason/authority/trustworthiness."
