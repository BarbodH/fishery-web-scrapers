892130,wkrp,2015-01-14 15:52:00,656,Is anybody using their outboard engine to charge their 12V trolling motor battery. I have read that it is possible to do this by hooking up the cranking battery in parallel with the deep cycle battery with an isolator between the two batteries
892135,irishfield,2015-01-14 16:28:00,26272,"IF the motor has enough amperage output sure. Go into Canadian Tire to the motorhome parts section and find the dual battery isolator. It will charge both.. and only drain the one being used. Just make sure you put it somewhere high and dry, the real marine ones are sealed.  Now that said... unless you have a LONG boat ride back to the dock, it's not going to completely charge a run down trolling battery."
892136,John Bacon,2015-01-14 16:31:00,3277,"An electric motor will drain your batter much faster than your outboard can charge it.  Most people probably use their trolling motor more than their outboard.  If you are the type of person that uses their outboard for five minutes to get to a spot and then uses the trolling motor to fish the spot for an hour, then the minimal charge that you would get from the outboard probably wouldn't be worth it.  It may have some merit for those you usually troll with their outboard and only occasionally use there electric motor.  It works in theory but would be too beneficial to most people."
892148,c10,2015-01-14 17:53:00,131,"Like the other guys said, you wouldn't get enough power from the run to your spot.  You would be better off just buying a better battery or hooking up a bank system in my opinion"
