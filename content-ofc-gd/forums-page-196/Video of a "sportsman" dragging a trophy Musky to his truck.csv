886729,Gallie,2014-12-15 12:09:00,1215,"I love eating pike in the 1-3 lb range, as good or better then picies in my own opinion, this pike weighed 18 lbs and was probably 20 years old so it wasnt the tastiest morsel ever."
886766,bigcreekdad,2014-12-15 14:50:00,546,"I prefer pike over walleye for eating.  As for keeping big muskie.....A well known, but usually kept secret, fact is that tomato plants balloon when planted over muskie parts. The bigger the better. Just cut the whole fish into inch thick steaks....dig holes precisely 8 inches deep, and 18 inches apart. You'll get the biggest darn tomatoes you've ever seen."
886773,manitoubass2,2014-12-15 15:36:00,11391,I absolutely love tomatoes but no way am I harvesting a fish for fertilizer lol  I've heard of this alot though is it true? or just some long running joke?
886775,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-15 15:44:00,8243,"It's true, but we used to use fish guts not meat. If too many used the tomatoes tasted like fish."
886778,jimmer,2014-12-15 16:11:00,2730,"Isn't it against the law to catch and release fish in some countries over in Europe? It's all catch and keep to avoid torturing fish. I actually have a neighbour who loves to fish but won't go bass fishing because he won't eat them. He will only fish for panfish or walleye, sometimes lakers. It's always a tough pill to swallow when you see a trophy fish kept, but no one is breaking any laws. Now if they have a freezer full at home, that's a different story."
886781,Headhunter,2014-12-15 16:40:00,5703,"Uhm, just a thought, but at what size generally do musky stop effectively spawning? I know that with pickereye, once they reach a certain size, their ability to create eggs diminishes. Would that also be true of muskies? Are we protecting the wrong fish? HH"
886817,c10,2014-12-15 19:25:00,131,"Well that's up for debate, I talked to a fisheries biologist prof who did a guest lecture here not long ago and he said all of that size of fish to ratio of good and bad eggs for walleye stuff is bull, none of their studies have shown anything to suggest that walleye eggs are less fertile as they get older.  He said because the bigger ones lay more eggs it is likely that more eggs go unfertilized because of the satellite spawning, ie. some just don't get fertilized in natural spawning areas because the semen doesn't get to the egg in time and whatnot.  So I don't know, just passing on what I was told..."
886830,jimmer,2014-12-15 20:43:00,2730,"HH, muskie vary so much in size from one body of water to another, who could possibly know. I would have to say a 52""+ fish in the kawarthas is getting near the end of it's life cycle, yet one from Georgian Bay might be in it's prime at that size."

We get WAY too carried away with this IMO. I don't keep them, but absolutely no issue with those who  keep them to eat , vs those that keep them for show, or to mount. I stuffed a muskie 25 years ago....and still regret it. Had I eaten it, with relish, or to feed my family, I'd have zero qualms.  I, for one (and maybe only one), am awful tired of how we hold this fish so freakin high on what we consider sacred.  I chase this species with a passion, and release all of them (exception noted above)....but they are still just a freakin fish.  Ban me if you'd like"

I was not specifically referring to this muskie incident but more so towards  seeing people catch 30 bass off season and keep them all. Same with pike/walleyes and salmon. My opinion is people need to be better educated on limits and what the different species are.

The kawartha's are loaded with them, and 99% of them are released. I don't see what the big deal of keeping one is at all. If its legal, go for it.  My dad used to keep them when the slot was 36""....they were OK eating, but still a little big for my liking.  I'd take a 16"" walleye over a 3lber anyday.  S."

Even the ""Y"" bone meat can be processed into fish cakes. The former father in law wouldn't even let a pike into the boat, called them snakes. During the weekly fish fry at the cottage we did up a pike and put in on his plate. He said ""now that's what I'm talking about"", "" It's one of those snake fish Dad"", he didn't believe us."

Doesnt do much to protect the fish. I really like the approach Michigan is taking. You want to keep one, then you have to buy a tag, and limit it to one a season.  There is zero good reason to ever keep a Musky (outside of survival situations) same goes for killing a steelhead for its roe."

886393,SuperDave,2014-12-13 16:37:00,204,"Unfortunately, some muskie fishermen develop a holier than thou attitude. Probably due to the endless amount of time and money they invest in catching a trophy muskie. I am one of them. However, if its legal for someone to possess a trophy fish of any species, then so be it. Most educated fishermen know a trophy fish is a very old fish, and should be released. What irks folks is those of us not yet lucky enough to catch a trophy of such size after years of chasing them, only to see someone catch ""that fish"" and harvest it. Now imo Lake St. Clair is a different case. The muskie population has exploded and you have to think that some ""culling"" can't hurt. That big fish i'm sure will be quickly replaced by another. I only began to experience this muskie fishery this year. Had a great time this fall and caught plenty of 40"" plus fish. I don't really see it causing a problem when LEGAL size fish get taken. As long as the regulations are followed. Now places like the French River or West Arm, are a different story. A lot less muskies so harvesting would definitely hurt. I was shocked many years ago when I stayed at a lodge on the West Arm. They pulled out all their pics for us to look at, I guess to pump us up for muskie fishing. I could not believe the number of photos of big muskie taken from the dock or actually frozen from being in the freezer. A guy standing there holding a frozen 45"" muskie, and the lodge owner says "" oh ya that's so and so, he comes up here for 2 weeks every year"". Now that's concerning."

Yet they should always select the smaller specimens of whatever species they are catching to eat - as long as they are legal according to the Ontario Fishing Regulations - and release the larger ones.  In almost all species the larger fish are the prime spawners and if released provide the best hopes for a sustainable resource.

I practice a live release on trophy fish of all species. (Especially all muskie). If I'm going to keep a couple fish I'm not going to choose a fish in the trophy category, I prefer a little younger and smaller. I have found for walleye that I enjoyed a walleye in that 19 inch range. I have eaten larger eyes in different zones and just noticed the mid range age fish just taste a little better. I would prefer a 2 1/2 pound bass to a 5 lbs but that's just my opinion. Although it is not the way I choose to harvest fish, and I would never do it, it is legal and at the end of the day, and can be a tough one to debate when you know you can't win, the law is the law. But I never like to see trophy muskie killed ( if your feeding your family then you do what you have to do ) but I unfortunately have seen instances where the fish was killed to be brought in for show and tell and ended up being fertilizer, I thought this day in age technology and cameras would cut down on that.

It harms fish for no good reason, gives them ""infections"" and is a pointless waste of time.  He certainly doesn't agree with ""sport""fishing and when I brought up tournament fishing to joke, he nearly got up and walked away.  ""Terrible thing the White ego,"" he said.

I suppose my main question would be availability of the species - if there is enough of a constantly reproducing population (natural, stocked or both) to sustain the pressures of a harvest, then its really not wrong to take your legal limit and not waste the fish without damaging the ecosystems.  I do tend to get upset when I see trophies in the guts bucket up north or guys pulling out a stringer full of kawartha 5 pound eyes or pictures of 150 jumbos in a cleaning hut.  I eat fish don't get me wrong, I just think it is interesting to see other people who have totally contrary views to mine, but in many cases neither side is truly morally wrong if the ecosystem isn’t being abused/ balanced and properly reproducing.  I personally think our first concern should always be ensuring that there will be a fishery for the nest generation to selectively harvest a healthy reproductive population, i mean we can all sit here and argue that it was his legal right to take the fish, sure, but just because you could chop down the whole forest doesn't mean you should lol The way I see it this video isn't a legal way to catch fish as he is breaking a bunch of traffic laws in the process lol just my two cents."

Would people feel better if that was a pike instead?  It's too bad people aren't 'outraged' when loads of fat salmon are roped up and dragged along the bank by steelheaders looking for free roe...

That should outrage anyone who fishes, I've heard of guys in cambridge throwing 5lbs eyes on the bank to rot because they areeating the guys trout flies, seriously?  But whenever I saw somehting to them i'm a member of P3TA or just a liberal activist fool.  Really!? Why am I being vilified for being concerned with the fisheries future? lol, I understand it is their right to 'keep' the fish, but seriously, its okay to keep any fish as long as our faulty regs say its okay? lol - may be why so many of our pressured lakes are in decline.  sorry for the rant(s) guys and gals"

Maybe he likes to eat them? The clubbing them to death was tossing them in the water for the hawks to eat..Big difference...Its a slippery slope when we start thinking one fish should be eaten and not others..I know some guys that like to eat moose does that mean they shouldn't hunt deer too?"

886323,bigugli,2014-12-13 03:15:00,6138,  Can't beat a breakfast of eggs taters and bass cooked in bacon grease. My arteries are cracklin just thinking about it.
886324,manitoubass2,2014-12-13 03:21:00,11391,Ive never tried musky but two fish I care not for are bass and catfish.  if its legal what can ya do?  some people just have different morals. you cant change that. why worry about it?

I can't believe a fish that old can taste any good anyway. Just my opinion.  Actually had Deer and Walleye today and it was great. And no I don't belong to P3TA."
886327,manitoubass2,2014-12-13 03:39:00,11391,I hear ya dood. I dont keep trophy fish nor would I want to. Ive kept one big bass and one big walleye because of deep hooking crankbaits.  I did not enjoy it one bit.  but it is what it is  maybe the guy has ten kids at home to feed? lol

It's funny, I actually sat with an old Native friend just this afternoon who's point of view is, there should be no such thing as catch and release fishing at all.  It harms fish for no good reason, gives them ""infections"" and is a pointless waste of time.  He certainly doesn't agree with ""sport""fishing and when I brought up tournament fishing to joke, he nearly got up and walked away.  ""Terrible thing the White ego,"" he said.  He's obviously in a minority as well."
886333,manitoubass2,2014-12-13 04:03:00,11391,yep. ive seem that on my rez. fish for a meal and any more then you can eat go to elders  I have zero issue with that
886336,irishfield,2014-12-13 04:16:00,26272,"Yep.... my step father can't even comprehend why we spend hours out fishing and then let them go. Fishing was ""invented"" as a food source."
886338,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 04:19:00,8243,"Yea I thought maybe he had a bunch of kids to feed too, that I understand. But the late model SUV tells me different. I have had to keep a few big smallies here, but gave them away, I watch them spawn from my deck. No way I could eat one of my pets either. If it was a matter of not having food, watch what I will keep to feed my family. And I hear Sheepshead are good done right. I have a neighbor that will take any I catch and appreciates it. If the price of meat goes any higher who knows what we will be chomping on soon. Lots of squirrels here, for now! Hey honey, squirrel,,,, er I mean Rabbit tonight."
886364,sauce,2014-12-13 13:26:00,219,No offense iron maker...  but keep in mind you are trying to get people to discuss the morals behind why this guy or anyone else would keep a trophy fish. A discussion about morals will bring out a lot of opinions. Now there's guys saying that sport fishing is a waste of time. Who in their right mind would even suggest such a thing? People who say things like that should have their opinion taken away.  Then people who agree that fishing isn't a waste of time can comment on whether they agree on someone's decision to keep a legal catch.  They should start a petition to ban people from eating any fish that is deemed morally wrong.
