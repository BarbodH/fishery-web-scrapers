892648,Raf,2015-01-18 00:02:00,3495,its a good deal unless you plan on networking them
892674,BFSC Kevin,2015-01-18 03:44:00,1351,"Yup,  like Raf mentioned.  The elite 7 can not be networked to the hds.  The elite doesn't have the capability. Considering the retail price of both units is about $2000 including tax,  seems like a decent deal.  Is the hds a gen1 of gen2? That will affect the value.."
892824,Afraz,2015-01-19 04:45:00,250,HDS Gen 2 Kevin
892835,Yellow Fever,2015-01-19 11:59:00,139,"It seems like a fair price and both have warranty, the Gen 2 HDS 8 are available for $1000 so for a little bit more you may be able to get new stuff with full warranty...."
