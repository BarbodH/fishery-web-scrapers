891672,Raf,2015-01-11 21:49:00,3495,i wouldnt hesitate to buy used on kijii if you are looking to save a few dollars.  some guys must have the latest and greatest and upgrade all the time.  if you arent one of those guys you can find a decent deal.
891676,Raf,2015-01-11 21:55:00,3495,show us a pic of how the speakers are connected at the source.. you said earlier that you only have one wire going from the receiver to the sub then the signal gets split out to each speaker at the sub?  that's a little unusual and the bad news is you may or may not need speakers too.
891686,davey buoy,2015-01-11 22:50:00,5505,"show us a pic of how the speakers are connected at the source.. you said earlier that you only have one wire going from the receiver to the sub then the signal gets split out to each speaker at the sub? that's a little unusual and the bad news is you may or may not need speakers too. Without pulling everything out again Raf,it's a powered sub woofer,with a cable looking somewhat like a flat ,1"" wide plug that goes to the back of the receiver. On the back of the sub there are 5 sets of speaker wire connectors.Strip the wire and push them in. Push on the clip to pull out.Standard speaker wire connectors I believe.5 sets,giving you the 5.1.Definitely not a hdmi plug."
891687,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 22:54:00,4399,Sounds like a good idea to upgrade the receiver....you can get a Denon receiver for a 150 bucks at futureshop these days.
891689,davey buoy,2015-01-11 22:56:00,5505,"Sounds like a good idea to upgrade the receiver....you can get a Denon receiver for a 150 bucks at futureshop these days. Not bad,good name,should do what I want.Thanks,I'll swing by tomorrow and check it out."
891690,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 23:00:00,4399,Sounds to me like we have one of those all in one home theater in a box thingy...speakers should work with a new receiver not sure about the sub though.
891691,Raf,2015-01-11 23:00:00,3495,sounds like your speakers will work provided they are the correct impedance.  most receivers can accept speaker of 6-16 ohm impedance.   your sub won't and you'll need a new one.
891707,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 23:29:00,4399,And a new sub will set you back another 150
891710,davey buoy,2015-01-11 23:40:00,5505,"I hear you  lol,time to bite the bullet I guess .Thanks guys again."
891714,Raf,2015-01-11 23:50:00,3495,definately shop around and go used if you can.  I bought my JBL sub off kijji for less than that and its a pretty good unit.
891841,davey buoy,2015-01-12 20:49:00,5505,"Found my better sub,model Technics SB-AS40.In this picture shows RCA cables from Receiver's sub woofers out.Input to sub.Think this will work.?. Thanks again guys,this worked well with my Harmon Kardon system a while back."

Thanks again guys,this worked well with my Harmon Kardon system a while back. I still know I need a receiver,but if this can work,will save me half the price.It used to pound pretty good I must say.Hope to hear from you guys soon.Thanks."
891843,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-12 20:59:00,4399,If your receiver has a sub out it should work...I am thinking it does not.

891857,ccmtcanada,2015-01-12 22:04:00,7971,I don't see a sub out rca in the pics you posted earlier....unless it was on side not shown in your pic....
891858,davey buoy,2015-01-12 22:11:00,5505,I don't see a sub out rca in the pics you posted earlier....unless it was on side not shown in your pic.... I'm buying a new 5.1 or better receiver.Forget about the old pics as I have determined it's time to upgrade.The last picture today was to find out if the newer receivers have sub woofer out rca hook ups to work with the sub I posted a little while ago.Thanks
891865,ccmtcanada,2015-01-12 22:55:00,7971,Any new receiver should have sub output!  Great reason to upgrade your audio system by getting that Roku.  Good job with that!! Lol

Lol Great tv,free for the most part,Netflix is what started all this lol.Thanks.I have pictures when I go in to get a receiver ."
891898,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-13 01:22:00,4399,yes it will I was referring to the old one not having a sub out.
891902,Raf,2015-01-13 01:39:00,3495,ya that sub will work with any newish receiver you will buy.  most receivers will have 'only' one channel out for the sub so you'll hook up to either the left or right input on the sub -- shouldn't matter which one.
891940,davey buoy,2015-01-13 08:03:00,5505,"Thanks again guys,you made my day.I'll let you know what I end up getting as a receiver.  Dave."
892164,davey buoy,2015-01-14 21:21:00,5505,"Went to get the Denon as recommended.No stock,went home decides ok I'll order it ,back up I go.Out of stock,sold last one while I was gone as I did not know when I was in there earlier. Raised a bit of a stink,not much really lol and they gave me the Pioneer VSX-524-K . In stock,saved about $150 bucks on that one which they matched with the Denon.Set up,works really well all around.The HDMI connections sure make thing easy.One more HDMI cord and I will change my dvd set up as well.No Rca jacks except for the sub.140 watts x 5,has a good punch as well.Thanks guys,glad I upgraded ,had to be done at some point soon."
892166,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-14 21:50:00,4399,Glad it worked out.
891493,davey buoy,2015-01-10 21:03:00,5505,"Working amazing on my 40"" lcd Phillips tv. Nice picture,streams flawlessly.The stick resembles a usb memory stick,but maybe twice as big and HDMI.Plugs directly into one of the ports.For me HDMI 3 is the easiest to get at. My surround sound system is a older Panasonic 5 disc changer that works in 5.1.Works great with the cable PVR and dvd player .The surround sound receiver does not have HDMI.I use one pair of rca jacks from the out put to the input of the tv.That's it.Cable box to HDMI #1,Roku to #3.My problem is when I switch the tv to #3,there is no surround sound.The only way I can hear it is through the tv.speakers. Called Roku,the technician new less than me. I understand it's 2.1,but why won't it come out the surround sound speakers?. One thing I did notice was if the cable box is left on,sound still will come through the 5.1,surround. I Can see the Roku picture on #3 hdmi,kinda weird.Switched them up and still does the same thing so I believe the hdmi ports are working properly. Looked on line and the terms they use are a little overwhelming to me. lol.Any ideas?thanks for any help in advance guys. The streaming stick is wireless,with a power cord attached to the stick.That's it."
891554,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 00:46:00,4399,"It works when the cable is on because the cable box is processing the audio, it does not with the stick because your tv is processing the audio...does that make sense??? Your going to have to get the 5.1 that is coming from the Roku to TV via HDMI TO your surround sound.  So I would think audio output on your TV would have to go to the Panasonic.  With my streaming box I use a digital link from the TV to the sound bar to get stereo.  That's probably as clear as mud...Lol"
891557,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 00:55:00,4399,Also what Roku do you have and I am assuming you went to the Roku menu to set up the audio. Not all Roku stream in 5.1

891568,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-11 01:22:00,4399,I wonder if you could just put the roku into a port on the cable box..it's been awhile since I have used electronics without hdmi.  in order to hear stereo you are going to have to get that 5.1 that the Roku is give you to your receiver try audio output on tv to audio imput on the receiver.
891569,Raf,2015-01-11 01:58:00,3495,"you;re gonna want a hdmi capable receiver sooner than later  the way most people have it setup is all their devices connect to their surround receiver via hdmi then one hdmi cable to the tv.  the receiver handles the switching between devices.  i'm surprised you get anything out of your rear speakers the way you have it (if i am understanding it right -- devices into the tv via hdmi then tv to receiver with rca left and right for the audio) and i suspect it's just a copy of your front left and right coming out of the rear, not real surround.  the old way of 5.1 surround sound before hdmi was with 5 (or 6 if you have a sub) cables, one for each channel (the two fronts, front center and the two rear channels)."

891628,ccmtcanada,2015-01-11 17:43:00,7971,Do you have headphone jack on the TV?  Patch that thru to  vcr audio in on receiver or get y adapters and patch thru to existing TV audio in jack.  Anything going thru TV audio will go to your receiver that way.

I think upon closer viewing I have been mistaken.That red and white on the tv goes to the dvd player.The cable box and receiver are together by rca jacks then the hdmi up to#1 hdmi.I believe no headphone jack.Sorry about the confusion,but I don't use the dvd,so really the rca cables to the tv are not being used."

From what I can tell you need to take the audio OUT from the TV and put that into your receiver.  The audio should go through the HDMI cables to the TV and then out from the TV to your receiver.    You shouldn't need the audio OUT from the cable to the receiver after that.  You have two options for that.   On the TV, the RCA out that has the cable in it (I assume it's an OUT??) or the Digital Audio Out next to the service port.
