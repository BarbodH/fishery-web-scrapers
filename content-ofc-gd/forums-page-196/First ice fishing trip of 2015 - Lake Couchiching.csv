891405,ctranter,2015-01-10 02:04:00,543,"Great production value here! You take ice fishing vids to a new level , thx for sharing it"
891594,BFSC Kevin,2015-01-11 06:12:00,1351,"Thanks all again for the positive feedback!  Good stuff man! How are those spring bobbers treating ya? Which bobbers?  It is nice to be young and talented. Now I know why the old timers way back when invited us to ice fish with them, drill the many holes for them with manual augers and set up the old Army tent. My 1st ever ice trip was on Couch. Ever thought about getting a few sled dogs?  Don't want to sound like a broken record but cool video guys, keep up the great work.  I have to say you guys sure fit a lot of equipment into that little red SUV you drive. Thanks again! Its always great to hear.  Did you travel in one of these?   It was a mazda 3 hatchback"
892083,gkasko,2015-01-14 04:13:00,2,We had pretty good luck last week. Landed at least 25-30 fish each per day. Would have been S.O.L without the fishfinder though!

890871,Hooked,2015-01-07 17:18:00,891,"Great video once again, that looked like fun, minus the lugging of the equipment.   Btw, I really like that portable fish finder setup, is that a custom build?  Or did it come that way?  Would like to make the exact same setup as that.  Any info would be appreciated.  Your other video's on your channel are cool too."
890875,Acountdeleted,2015-01-07 17:43:00,2562,Great catch! Chris K and I were there too yesterday in about 7 FOW. lots of 5 inchers and enough in the 8-9 inch range for a small snack. Was still a great day.

890913,gkasko,2015-01-07 21:42:00,2,"Wow great first trip of 2015. How thick is the ice at Couchiching? Cool video, by the way."

Your other video's on your channel are cool too. The portable fish finder was a mod I did myself. This lowrance unit is from my boat but I use for ice fishing during the hard water times. I guess I could make a video of how I have it set up.  great job on the video, that must have taken a lot of editing and a few cameras .... I did bring a few cameras to shoot this. And it did take several hours to go through all the footage and edit it.  Very cool video... I'm more and more impressed every time you post one.I'm not sure if it's the camara angle or not.... But that hut looks like a mansion! Especially the inside shots.What a great day of fishing guys.As do St. John, where did you check on the ice? Usually St john freezes up before the coochG Having a 6 man hut is pretty spacious  but it is a bit heavier and cost more to heat up. I didn't check out St John myself, it was the guys I bumped into at Couch that told me that.  Wow great first trip of 2015. How thick is the ice at Couchiching? Cool video, by the way. Ice was at least 6"" where I was."
