892008,mercforever,2015-01-13 21:42:00,67,"just crossed the credit north side of 401,sure looked like one perched in a tree.seen plenty as a kid growing up on the margaree river,cb.we didn't need a rooster when you had them screeching at first light"
892010,AKRISONER,2015-01-13 22:04:00,5558,"Word around Ontario is that since the ban of DDT, they have began to make a recovery. There are natural Bald Eagles nesting in the Hamilton Botanical Gardens. The government actually closed part of the park to ensure that they were not disturbed while nesting.  I personally saw 2 bald eagles on seperate occaisions in the Parry Sound area for the first time in 16 years just this fall. I am sure others would attest that yes Bald Eagles have been in this area a while, but speaking with my parents sightings are becoming more abundant. My hope is that with their return, they put pressure on the booming comorand population, from what i could see the one bald eagle that decided to land on a small reef out in the middle of a bay sure pissed off the resident comorands but also had them scrambling the heck out of there."
892014,cram,2015-01-13 22:36:00,1733,Have seen them in Oakville twice.
892015,lew,2015-01-13 22:45:00,12766,They've been moving into the Kawarthas for the last few years and they sure are nice to see.  Took this picture from my boat 6 or 7 years back north of Peterboro.    And had these 2 circling above my house near Burliegh Falls 2 years ago.  
892017,Rodbender,2015-01-13 22:52:00,1027,Yep making a come back nice to see got this one saturday froze my knackers off 
892018,mercforever,2015-01-13 22:56:00,67,"when I was a kid,they used to walk to this big sandbar across from our house when the tide was out.me and my sister used to see how close we could get from them.my buddys dad had a small farm up river,aftr butchering a cow,theyd bring the gutpile down on the enterval,nothing to see 20 at a time"
892020,Meegs,2015-01-13 23:01:00,249,I've seen them 5 or 6 years ago off big bay point... aswell as parry sound and north bay.  Pretty cool and a pleasure to watch
892026,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-13 23:17:00,8243,"They were certainly here in Haldimand County in good numbers cruising the north shore of Erie. So abundant apparently that the MNR gave Samsung the OK to cut down an occupied nest across the road from us on Fisherville Rd.  to erect 3  Wind Turbines here in the fall a few years ago. I still want to scream when I think about it. Money and politics can make anything happen. I used to see them every other week before that cut down that nest, not now. I've not seen a single Eagle last year and very few since the hundreds of turbines went up. I have no scientific quantified numbers, just not many sighting by us since, must be co incidence."
892027,solopaddler,2015-01-13 23:19:00,8605,"Beautiful birds, they're very common a little further north in Ontario. Always have been."
892029,bare foot wader,2015-01-13 23:26:00,1354,"very cool to see them making a comeback in southern ON, saw a few around port Stanley growing up  I have a love/hate relationship with baldies...tend to be better fishing when they're around, but they are sometimes bold and very keen on salmon gut piles....also entire salmon if you're not careful and have it tied to the drift boat lol"
892037,woodenboater,2015-01-13 23:57:00,2277,Saw one over Wolseley Bay a few years back. Cost was a mangled prop but worth it
892038,richyb,2015-01-14 00:02:00,774,I have seen them the last 2 years on the trap line. This year there are even a couple golden eagles hanging out with them.
892053,Old Man,2015-01-14 00:56:00,822,"There are so many of them out this way, that I hardly notice them sometimes. Counted fifteen sitting in a group on the ice one March day a couple of years ago. These two decided to take a rest on my front lawn a few years back. "
892090,tender52,2015-01-14 06:07:00,270,"We have a nesting pair for the last 5 yrs now at Bluffers park in Cambridge. Last spring when the die off happened on Pushlinch lake, I can attest to the possibility of 3 hanging around the lake."
892091,tender52,2015-01-14 06:09:00,270,"Just read my post.  Not 3 pairs, but 3 were circling the couple times i passed by"
892129,Beavertail,2015-01-14 15:43:00,331,"Just happened to see an adult Bald Eagle today while driving to work...just north of Waterloo. It was standing in a farmers field eating something the farmer must have discarded, along with a bunch of crows. They have become more common here in the last few years, especially along the Conestogo and Grand rivers. I never seem to get over how large they appear, surprises me every time!"
892131,Beavertail,2015-01-14 15:57:00,331,"Do you think they were Golden Eagles or could have been juvenile Bald Eagles? Juveniles are overall dark brown and don't aquire the characteristic adult plumage ""white head and tail"" for several years. Just a thought."
892138,Muskieman,2015-01-14 16:43:00,2472," There's a very healthy population on Nipissing / French River , quite common up here and farther north. ."
892140,Joeytier,2015-01-14 16:51:00,3990,The ottawa river valley up here ia just silly with Balds.  During the summer i see them almost daily!
892141,NAW,2015-01-14 17:21:00,4022,I saw two together in a tree in Orr lake last winter.  And then many many single sightings.  There are lots around for sure.
892149,hutch4113,2015-01-14 17:58:00,374,"Glad to see the posts...I thought I was seeing things a few months ago - saw 2 up in  Severn Bridge, just past the canal.  Was on the highway, so did not get a good look, but I could have swore they were Bald Eagles.  Had no idea they used to be in this area - be really cool if they are back."
892150,Gallie,2015-01-14 18:08:00,1215,"Theres a couple right in the south end of simcoe, i usually see them a few times a year flying around the swamp"
