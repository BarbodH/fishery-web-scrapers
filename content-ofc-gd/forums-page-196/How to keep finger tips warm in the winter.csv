891831,Old Man,2015-01-12 18:52:00,822,I use one of these. Keeps my fingers warm and my beer cold 
891847,FloatnFly,2015-01-12 21:14:00,1640," I worked outside my whole life and always found wool mitts worn inside good leather mitts were warmer than anything else I tried, even when they were wet.  Not much good though if your trying to do any fine work.   no. not god for fine work, but even with gloves, you gotta take em off to re tie or re bait.  mittens work by using your own body heat, where gloves have to rely on layers"
891851,adempsey,2015-01-12 21:28:00,1498,What about those chemical hot packs like Hot Hands?  Toss them in your mitts and keep'em toasty!
891864,Canuck2fan,2015-01-12 22:51:00,1444,"Surprised that no one mentioned these reusable hand warmers. They do work great, but a couple of things to keep in mind.  1 Keep them in their own hard sided container until you want to use them as they will sometimes activate in a pocket.  2 Once they are activated they do get fairly stiff so unless they fit into the pocket on your gloves before you activate them they won't be much good to you for that.  http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=52295&cat=2,40725,45454  The biggest advantage though is they are the perfect excuse to go visit your local Lee Valley store LOL."

892007,Sinker,2015-01-13 21:39:00,8692,"Dip your hands in the water, or scrub them with snow. They will stay warm once they warm up again. 99% of the time my hands are bare, the rest of the time I wear thin WOOL gloves. The only time I wear proper gloves is when running a machine across the lake or through the trails.  Sounds weird, I know, but trust me, it works.  S."
892011,aplumma,2015-01-13 22:21:00,6896,"I did some research and the only time I found in print was from 1900-1920 medical journal to rub the affected area as well as rub snow on the area. As medical knowledge advanced the standing practice today is to not rub the area or to get them wet in water or snow. Here is a cut and paste of the ddynamics of bodies reaction to cold.  Thermo-receptor cells, less than a millimeter below the surface of the skin, are what cause us to experience changes in temperature, says Michael Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth. Normally, the skin is kept at a comfortable temperature thanks to blood pumping through the capillaries — tiny, branch-like blood vessels that make up our microcirculation.  But when the thermo-receptors detect cold, they react by causing the capillaries to shut down, diverting blood flow — and warmth — to the heart, lungs and other internal organs. This process is called vasoconstriction. Incredibly, when we’re cold the amount of blood flowing into the skin in the extremities can become as low as  0.02 litres per minute (the maximum rate is two to three litres per minute). ‘It’s a bit like placing a blood pressure cuff on the arm,’ says Professor Tipton. ‘It’s the hands, face and feet that tend to be coldest and that’s partly because they’re exposed, but it’s also because the body will sacrifice these extremities to keep the internal organs warm.’ That’s why our hands turn white, and even blue, in the cold, and why those who survive extremely cold conditions lose fingers and toes to frostbite.

892105,aplumma,2015-01-14 12:28:00,6896,"The mechanics behind the snow dip or rub is that your body perceives a warmer temperature after the snow dip. Which triggers the ""repair"" mechanism ""flushing"" to occur so the nerve cells that sense the cold not the thermo receptors which control the smaller capillaries to open to prevent damage to the hands/feet from frostbite. It was the reason given why frostbite treatment has changed so dramatically from yesteryear. The human body has so many fascinating tricks it does to survive I am sure we will continue to be fascinated by what we learn for many years to come.   Art"

892258,dhickey,2015-01-15 03:18:00,1038,I all ways have a dry dish towel in my gear it's simple but very effective. I also have 2 pairs of good snowmobile mitts along with water proof work gloves. The long and short of it is that if your body is warm and dry your feet and and hands will be warm. As I have grown older it has become more of a challenge to keep my hands warm but the main thing i have noticed is that once my hands get numb they will then warm up to the point of steam rising off them if they get wet any thing under -15 is not a problem over -15 caution is important.  My Great Grandma always told me to keep my feet and hands dry and the rest of my body would look after itself. And never go to bed with cold feet.! That has never failed me.  Mind you the outer ware we use today is far superior to what she lived with but the basic principle still exist.  Just our 2 cents.
891017,okumasheffield,2015-01-08 03:49:00,318,Looking for tips to keep finger tips warm in the winter.  Have no luck after trying all kinds of gloves/mittens on the market.  Thanks in advance
891020,manitoubass2,2015-01-08 04:07:00,11391,"get severe frost bite on your finger tips. not enough to have them cut off, just enough to cause nerve damage j/k.  I find some gear better then others but nothing is perfect for my hands. its give and take.  one thing for sure is avoid alcohol or stimulants of any kind  I find the best thing is to keep moving. Ive fished without a shack in -40's and stayed plenty warm just by moving. drill a few extra holes even."
891021,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-08 04:07:00,10439,"I use the heated grips and thumb warmer on my sled!!! That and the 15,000 BTU heater in my hut."

891028,Joeytier,2015-01-08 04:26:00,3990,"Frabill FXE Gauntlet gloves...by far the warmest I have ever owned.  I don't like fishing in portable huts so my cut-off is -30 but up to -30 these gloves are friggin awesome, and very durable!"

891044,wormdunker,2015-01-08 09:40:00,1711,I use the metal hand warmers.  The type you add lighter fluid and light them.  I also have artic armour mitts - but they're too bulky to fish with.
891053,aplumma,2015-01-08 12:36:00,6896,My pops has a big issue with his hands hurting when they get cold. He has frost bitten them as well as burned them so even 40F is enough to cause him pain. I have tried all of the toys but they are either to heavy/ bulky or for some reason failed. I bought him a set of these  http://www.ventureheat.com/battery-heated-gloves/26-heated-glove-liners.html  They are not bulky and you can wear them under a set of gloves including rubber ones. So far they heat up within 45 seconds and the high temperature will drive your hands out in less than a minute. The battery packs work very well and with intermittent use on low or medium last longer than an eight hour trip.  Art
891056,Beavertail,2015-01-08 12:48:00,331,"Yup, I agree with Manitoubass2...movement helps a lot. One of the reasons I like using manual augers is they warm you up in a hurry. If my hands get cold, sometimes just swinging my arms around like a windmill a few times gets the blood flowing back to the finger tips as well...if other fisherman are around though they just might look at ya kinda funny!"
891059,BillM,2015-01-08 13:27:00,17367,"If I get super cold in the winter while ice fishing or steelheading, a quick dip of my hands into the water usually solves the problem."

891062,ccmtcanada,2015-01-08 13:29:00,7971,"Keeping moving around helps warm your whole body, but when ice fishing I find lots of time when I'm staying put in one place for a while.  I use those hot shot warmers and put them right in the palm of my hand.  You can put them on the outside of your hand as well if you find it impeded fishing. They sell them for boots too if your feet get cold as well.  I've used the metal hand warmers too but find them a bit bulky."
891065,Sinker,2015-01-08 13:41:00,8692,"This! Believe it or not, it works. Best way to warm your hands is to start off by getting them really cold. That gets the blood pumping to your digits, and they stay warm. "

That gets the blood pumping to your digits, and they stay warm.   I was skeptical at first as well, but man it works! lol!!   Like you said the blood starts to pump (they turn bright red) and after about a minute back in my gloves I'm golden."
891072,manitoubass2,2015-01-08 13:57:00,11391,it doesnt have to be a dip in the water either.  just intentionally getting your hands cold quickly works.  i did it all the time in the oilfield too.  its funny cause your hands stay waaaay warmer waaaay longer this way.  works with your feet too
891074,Fang,2015-01-08 14:03:00,1330,For ice fishing I always hit the dollar store/canadian tire before each season. I pick up a full box of the hot packs that go in your boots as they are really thin and I find the inexpensive thin knit gloves but they have to have some wool content. I use these gloves all ice fishing season under my heavy gloves. I buy several pairs and just swap a pair out if they get wet during the day.  When it's really cold I slip into the palm a thin hot pack. I can jig right handed or left handed while I put the other hand in my pocket to let the hot pack warm everything back up.

When I was a kid my dad used to say make a snow ball, or dip them in the water. All of the above works for me.  But in truth I find if I tough it out...they come just ""come back."" its like and adjustment period or somthing??? Now that being said, I don't recommend just toughing it out if you're going numb.
