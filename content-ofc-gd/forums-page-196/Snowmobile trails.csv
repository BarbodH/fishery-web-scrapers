891302,Dan668,2015-01-09 15:09:00,1120,"I bought my first new to me snowmobile last month, decided on a skidoo modular 3 helmet. Its main use was for ice fishing,  but since the ice is still sketchy, can somebody recommend me a place 1-2 hours north of Toronto where i can take it out, from my understanding everything that i can find requires a trail pass which i have no problem picking up.  Thanks"
891308,Joeytier,2015-01-09 15:29:00,3990,Go on the OFSC interactive trail map.  I heard that trails are starting to open up and are in good shape around minden/dorset
891310,Dan668,2015-01-09 15:32:00,1120,"Thanks for the link. Didnt know about the interactive map. Still a lot closed,  may be trying my luck for perch instead it seems"
891311,fishnsled,2015-01-09 15:36:00,3520,"There is not a lot open right now and with the few limited trails that are, it will likely be a circus this weekend.  This map will show you the trails of Ontario, just pick an area to ride and see what is open.  http://ofsc.mapbase.ca/viewer/  This is the home page for the OFSC.  You do need a trail pass to ride the trails, most sled dealers will have them although you can order online but it won't get to you before the weekend.  http://www.ofsc.on.ca/  The other option would be to go up to the Haliburton Forest and ride for the day, it's $50 I think.  Call ahead  though, it can be a very busy place.  http://www.haliburtonforest.com/activities/snowmobiling  I hope this helps."
891314,AKRISONER,2015-01-09 16:06:00,5558,remember when on the OFSC trails to use the applicable hand signals. They are a must when riding.
891327,ecmilley,2015-01-09 17:31:00,2163,Not much open but you can park in kinmount and do a ride to haliburton on b103. Easy ride for a shakedown and lunch at mquecks. imagine it will be busy. I I'll  stuck to lake running this weekend
892151,bdox,2015-01-14 18:09:00,329,"I recommend checking the Ontario DooTalk subforum for for updates. Lots of guys asking and lots of locals or guys who've been up for a tour answering.  Seems like if you don't want to go too far north, staging from Dwight puts you into the best conditions right now. Hali forest is an option, but they only let 100 sleds a day in, and you have to reserve early."
892155,irishfield,2015-01-14 18:43:00,26272,Midland / Penetang trails are open from what I understand..
892157,Rod Caster,2015-01-14 19:43:00,5784,My dad may still have an Ontario Pass for $50 less than current price. Let me know if interested and I'll ask him.
892161,Dan668,2015-01-14 20:39:00,1120,"Thanks for the updates. I'll keep that forum in mind Bdox. I'll definitely have the sled out this week, some trails are starting to open."
892188,ecmilley,2015-01-14 23:52:00,2163,Stick with the ofsc interactive trail guide for trail openings on official trails just cause a local says it good dont mean its open lose enough trails to trespassing. For more direct info call the local club for the area you wanna ride links at ofsc homepage
892239,i2cool2fool,2015-01-15 01:34:00,349,"OFSC site is certainly where to go for official trail status. In the past, I would review trail / trip reports on the forum at ""Ontario Conditions"". Google it. You'll be glad you did.  Happy trails."
