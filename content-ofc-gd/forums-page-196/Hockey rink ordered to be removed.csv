888538,misfish,2014-12-25 00:16:00,29133,"If It was not for out door rinks,I would not of know how to play the game of hockey. I remember skating at an out door rink when I was real young.Pops hood. Campbell Park  http://campbellpark.ca/wiki/wiki.php. I see it,s still going strong to this day.After a few times out there,I told my pop I was scared, cause I was not as good as the guys that were out there playing. I was able to skate up and down the boards without being bothered. That was the rule back then. The puck would come near me, and they would just pick it up and go on their way, and play their game. It took one,two years when I was skating good enough to finally play the game with them. I can tell you  this day,there is no other greater feeling, then playing a game of shinny on an open rink with guys that share and respect each other..  This makes me want to grab a pair of blades and head down there."
888540,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-25 00:38:00,10439,No shortage of rinks up here. The big ball diamond up the street is turned into a hockey rink surrounded by an outdoor speed skating oval by the city. By my place there are a couple of rinks on Kam Lake and there is one down by the houseboaters in Yellowknife Bay. Probably more I don't know about as well.  The city closes down the road 2 over from work for the winter so the kids can use the local granite hill as a sliding hill that ends up out on the road. They also have a gravel pit on the edge of town that is fenced in and is used for the kids to snow board on.

888614,mike rousseau,2014-12-25 19:22:00,4661,This rink is in my neighborhood...  My son got skates for Christmas and we were planning on walking over to teach him to skate there...  When I was a kid the local rink was so close we would walk over with our skate guards on... I was excited that my son was gunna be able to do the same...  Oh well...  Guess I'll have to pack him up and drive cross town to one if the few rinks left...
888620,dave524,2014-12-25 21:10:00,4508,"We didn't do rinks as a kid, I grew up in Pelham Township, Niagara in the midst of fruit farm country. Ponds were the ice surface of choice, used for irrigation and filling of sprayers . One farm even supplied benches for changing skates. I didn't skate on artificial ice in a rink till I was 19 and went to University in 69."
888628,bigugli,2014-12-25 23:46:00,6138,"  Nothing like good old pond hockey. Learned to skate, and play hockey, at the farm pond. When there was a heavy snow the one neighbour would come over on his lawn tractor and plow the pond for us. One rink for hockey. One rink for skating. I sure missed that when we moved to Toronto."
889292,Mike Pike,2014-12-30 14:32:00,1332,I think the real problem was building the rink on city property and so close to the road.  So there was no way the city could look the other way when the neighbours complained.  I wonder what would have happened if they just shortened the dimensions and kept it all on their own property?
889302,Steve,2014-12-30 17:38:00,2075,neighbors would have found another reason to complain.

889308,Steve,2014-12-30 18:18:00,2075,"it's generally not a good idea to have children playing beside the road...  not often do you see playgrounds beside roads either...  and really, a public ice rink is just a playground on the ice."

889314,Mike Pike,2014-12-30 18:35:00,1332,"I guess that's what I'm saying too.  I'm all for kids going outside and having some fun but I honestly think that rink is too close to the street.  It was creatived with the best of intentions, I know, but it can't stay up.  I know how the media likes to make villains out of people and say; ""Well the Grinch came early this Christmas,"" but I'd be siding with the City.  Sorry.  My Counsin and her neighbours maintained a neighbourhood rink a few winters ago just down the street from them but it was at a park well away from traffic."
889317,mike rousseau,2014-12-30 18:47:00,4661,Considering this is on a cresent/cull de sac... Whatever you wanna call it...  There's only 20 or so houses on this street and there is no exit... Only traffic would be local residents on this street  I understand they broke a bylaw...  But most arguments here are invalid cause they could rebuild if they want within bylaw restrictions and the kids are only a few feet further from the road and pucks can still fly...  The issue is a meathead neighbor... They apparently complained about an rv parked in a driveway too long as well...  Just someone with nothing better to do then cause problems for others...
889323,ch312,2014-12-30 19:28:00,1590,Anyone can stand in front of council and ask to be exempt from municipal bylaws. People do it all the time and often win giving them special permission to break the rules. It's my understanding that bylaw officers always give a warning before taking action which suggests this family had time to deal with the issue properly (relocating or speaking to council) before being ordered to remove it.  It was likely multiple complaints and lack of action by the rink owners which led to the closure...
891040,Reel Man,2015-01-08 07:41:00,80,"Yeah kids, go outside and play...but no hockey rinks, no skating, tag is banned on schoolyards and now....wait for it...let's ban tobogganing!!!  No tobogganing in Hamilton parks where kids have had their best times of the winter blasting down the hills!  Yeah, kids get hurt sometimes, used to be part of growing up.  Now it's cause for a lawsuit!!  Today you risk a $5000 fine for sledding in Hamilton.  Have fun kids, let me grab the bubblewrap before you go outside and wrap you up good..."
891098,AKRISONER,2015-01-08 15:49:00,5558,"the park across the street from me also has ""no tobogganing"" signs with threats of fines as well. However it seems like everyone ignores them, which is a good thing. I hope that the sole purpose of the signs is to remove liability, so that when someone does get hurt their parents dont try to sue the city for millions.  I would pray that the by law would never actually be enforced.  Theres two ways that i see this, I know that in St. Catherines people build their own private ice pads under the big hydro lines, clearly on Hydro's property but not one seems to have an issue with it. Personally Anything that gets kids out of the house is worthwhile."

888455,bigugli,2014-12-24 17:01:00,6138,"Back in the late 70's we used to put together a public rink in Scarborough. Sat on lands held by the school and the city park. We'd go out late in the evening to  scrape it, flood it, do minor repairs. All was good. Then one fall the community association received notices from the school board and the municipality. There were complaints from folks neighbouring the park.  Therefore the rink could only go up if certain conditions were met. Such things as providing mandatory adult supervision on the ice. Portable chain link fencing with a locked gate for when there were no adults available to supervise. $10,000 security deposit to be left with the municipality. That was the end of the rink, the playground fund and the association. You try and do good and end up getting pissed on by bureaucrats and politicians."

Oh I agree, there are definitely solutions to whatever concerns people have that are far better than putting the kibosh on the rink. I'm just saying that bylaws don't exist simply to annoy people, there are (arguably) valid reasons for them and cities can't really pick and choose which ones to enforce."

888471,Cookslav,2014-12-24 17:52:00,1457,"I have been a volunteer with the city of Kitchener for 25 years, helping to maintain a community rink. I am still listed as a volunteer but I moved away from the neighborhood nearly 6 years ago but I still drop in from time to time when I visit my parents.  See, my Father petitioned the city for the rights to do this rink when I was a kid and the neighborhood was just being built. It started as a patch of Grass in a feild next to a playground that My Dad (and I helped) flood with his own hose and water. He got his own boards and we'd put them up every November.  A few years later the city gave us a shed with big high pressure hose and a heater. Then they tore up the grass and gave us a gravel lot, and they supplied the boards. Then a few years later they laid down an ashphault pad and a flood light. Thay even gave us nets make of welded pipes and chainlink fence. Then came an expense account...we got a snowblower, Shovels, and some newer larger flood lights, and Dad no longer had to pay for the gas and use his snowblower. Some basket ball nets went up for summer use and that park was the highlight of our neighborhood for many kids. My house was more like a community center lol... Between myself and my 4 brothers and our freinds I can safely say that at any given time there were enough skates, sticks and gloves stored in my basement to equip a full shinny game of 10-15 guys. Fast forward 20 years...  A new neighbor 3 years ago complained about the Flood lights...it kept him up and he works mornings. (the light was timed to go off at 10:30pm but the city made us drop the light to go off at 8pm) Then it was another neighbor 2 years ago who complained the sound of pucks hitting the boards all day and it was an issue because this guy works nights....So the city removed the full size boards and left only the ankle breakers.  We of course protested saying the boards keep the pucks in the rink, and removing them poses a danger to people walking by, including parked cars, and the full boards actully prevent falls and cushion impact....it fell on deaf ears and the next year a kid broke his leg on the small boards. There was also a passer by who got nailed with a puck in the leg as they walked by....just a bruise but there was a complaint. Several parked cars got dings from pucks gone astray...so the city installed Snow fencing near the road to stop stray pucks this year....if we ever get winter we'll see how that works.  Bottom line, and the point I'm trying to make. all it takes is one or two bad apples to spoil the bunch. We had a successful rink that kids loved, and after a few changes the rink is hardly used as it used to be. It used to be like clock work. Young kids would play all day, and after dinner...the older kids and teens would be out plaing till 10:00-10:30....now its more of a recreational skate. No boards...no hockey, no hockey...less use. It is what it is.  You would think the city might have their volunteers backs after 25 years. When a complaint like these come in maybe they could respond with... ""its been here 20 years...you should have thought of that BEFORE you moved there."" Or ""We should punish the enitire community so you can sleep???...buy some ear plugs, and get a sun shade""  Its Sad... Last year when the weather was perfect for almost 4 months of use...That rink was nearly empty every time I drove by.    And for the record FreshTrax....my rink is on that list"

888416,vance,2014-12-24 13:08:00,719,As I told my one neighbour when she was complaining about a back yard rink near her   would you rather have them running the streets and up to no good or playing hockey in a fenced in yard !!!!
888417,Big Cliff,2014-12-24 13:12:00,6899,The problem is; no matter what you do or say someone will take offence to it!
888418,bigugli,2014-12-24 13:20:00,6138,"Welcome to suburban conformity. Your yard must be green, grass kept to under 2"" height. No more than 2 licensed vehicles on the driveway. White picket fences made of same material, style, and dimensions as all your neighbours. No clothslines. Must only BBQ with propane. Dogs must not bark. Babies must not cry. Children must not be spanked. Ritalin replaces discipline.  Etc, etc,..... ad nauseum.  There is not a single municipality in Southern Ontario that is without such rules."

888425,woodenboater,2014-12-24 14:33:00,2277,"Growing up in the city with a small backyard rink and as someone who broke enough windows of the home beside a park rink, this is a minor problem really. Make the rink smaller and problem solved, don't encroach on city property. I don't see this as a big bad city hall bureaucracy vs kid rink. My guess is, the puck on boards noise is a big issue that wasn't mentioned. Solve that with foam padding or insulation between the board and poly. They know what the problem was and next year there won't be a problem with the rink. and make sure the neighbours are on board"
888430,Terry,2014-12-24 14:50:00,14456,"I will bet the city came because of complaints from neighbours and if they were tired of dents in their cars or broken windows or noise all hours , then they had every right to get it removed  but if it was just the city flexing it's muscles  then shame on them"
888431,irishfield,2014-12-24 14:52:00,26272,"A 50 x 10 ""rink"" would be called a lap pool wb!"
888433,big guy,2014-12-24 15:10:00,414,The REAL reason the neighbours wanted the rink down is to get rid of all those hab sweaters polluting the neighbourhood.

888436,fishnsled,2014-12-24 15:18:00,3520,"Blame the politicians who voted for the bylaw, and the whiny little b!tches who complain about these things. If you are one of those whiny little b!tches, go flush your head in a toilet somewhere! Couldn't agree more!  I will bet the city came because of complaints from neighbours and if they were tired of dents in their cars or broken windows or noise all hours , then they had every right to get it removed  but if it was just the city flexing it's muscles  then shame on them  Well if the neighbours had some sense they wouldn't park their vehicles beside a rink and park a couple of doors down.  (If they feel the need to park on the street.)  As for the noise, I can't imagine it being that unbearable during the time they are playing but I'm not there to witness it.   3am might be a problem but guessing those kids are in bed.  Or vandalizing the neighbours house that called the city to complain next month.  lol.  Unfortunately it is the one or 2 squeaky wheels that get grease.  In the next election I'd be voting for someone else who has a set to stand up to these whiners."
888437,zenon11,2014-12-24 15:22:00,75,A puck could go over the boards and hit a car that's driving by. There's a reason bylaws are put into place.
888439,big guy,2014-12-24 15:28:00,414,"Wow, just wow to some of these comments. Did you all watch the video? Did you see the age of the kids? Did you see where the rink is, on what type of street? I would be shocked of more than 1 puck a day ends up going over the boards. Lighten up a little, go outside, take a deep breath and relax and have a Merry Christmas."
888441,Terry,2014-12-24 15:39:00,14456,"the neighbours driveway could well be only a few feet away from the rink, also their home and windows  and noise is noise   hours of the same noise can be enough to drive someone crazy  listen to a neighbrous dog bark for hours, they say but listen he doesn't even bark that loud, they can close their windows or sit inside the house rather then on their deck....no, noise is noise and everyone has the right to live happily within the laws and bylaws  with in reason   but I don't see a video when I bring up the story  that could change my mind"
888442,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-24 15:45:00,3761,"I'd crap on the neighbours door step for complaining....we hear kids all summer on the street outside my house on skate boards. We have never complained and never will. Most likely some old retired guy/girl with nothing better to do than ruin a good thing for the community. I hope they keep the boards up and I hope the kids continue to enjoy the hockey, most people can't afford to enrol the young ones in hockey these days. I would love to see 5 or 6 city workers show up and look at the faces on those 10 or 15 kids...   MTBF"
888443,dave524,2014-12-24 15:47:00,4508,"Kudos to my Town, I was just over to the town hall getting my dog license and I see they have an outdoor ice surface with boards there. Thinking it was a flooded rink and in danger of melting yesterday I asked and it does have refridgeration  , that's what in the small bulding adjacent,  the guy said it will keep ice up to 7C  and appears to be free for use.  edit: I'm guessing it is similar to the setups there use for the winter classic NHL games"
888444,MCTFisher9120,2014-12-24 15:53:00,3761,"A puck could go over the boards and hit a car that's driving by. There's a reason bylaws are put into place.  Yup, it could.........  Would you call on these kids and the 2 parents if you lived 15 houses down? We need more people like the parents who put that together and less people worried about there car taking a dent on the 1% chance something could go wrong if it happened...LOL"
888445,manitoubass2,2014-12-24 16:01:00,11391,if my driveway is ten feet from a rink Ill put up my own net to protect my vehicle. quick and cheap fix.  as soon as I finish on that project im putting my skates on and going out on the ice to play some hockey myself.
888446,manitoubass2,2014-12-24 16:05:00,11391,I grew up in my grandpas house and on a street filled with eldery folks.  my friends and I skateboarded all the time.  sure it bothered a few people but we used to make apple pies with my grandpa and bring them to the neighborhood.  guess what? you get to know these people through nice gestures and now your the nice kids on the block just having fun. no more complaints  getting rid of a hockey rink is a horrible idea IMO
