892401,lew,2015-01-16 13:41:00,12766,"Hope your friend finds shelter for his animals soon Albert, that's a sad story in these cold temps."
892419,HTHM,2015-01-16 14:51:00,4082,"The animals are sheltered now, but it is a temporary solution at best. He needs to find a long term solution while the rebuilding happens. It was quite a sight to see all the smoke coming out from the eaves of the barn and then to realize that there were over 20 goats inside and other assorted animals as well. We were fortunate to get the pony out, my other neighbour has to be credited with that rescue, I hightailed it to my house to get proper clothing on after realizing there was nothing to be done until the fire department arrived."
892426,HTHM,2015-01-16 15:12:00,4082,Solution found.
892456,lew,2015-01-16 17:32:00,12766,"Solution found.  Good to hear Albert.  On another sad note, a house just down the road from me burned to the ground yesterday morning but fortunately everyone got out safely."
