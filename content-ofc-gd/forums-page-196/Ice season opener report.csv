Thanks for the invite last night Emil, always a fun time fishing with you I think Rylee (my dog in the pic) is going to sleep for three days after all that exercise! lol We'll do it again in a few days buddy, see you soon!"
891923,bigugli,2015-01-13 03:45:00,6138,Well done. Hope to get up therein the next week or so.
891935,c10,2015-01-13 05:51:00,131,"Oohhh, nice fish! I am going to try to get my first whitefish this winter if time allows!  Thanks for the posting!"
891942,wormdunker,2015-01-13 10:43:00,1711,Nice fish - congrats!  I really like the shots of them coming up the hole.  I hope doggie wasn't cold.
891949,Fisherpete,2015-01-13 11:33:00,1814,"Wow - awesome! Nice to see whiteys, they were few and far between for me last year."
891955,Beavertail,2015-01-13 13:08:00,331,"Sounds like a great day on the ice! Gets me excited to chase some whities too, really looking forward to this season. Thanks for the pics."
891990,NAW,2015-01-13 19:35:00,4022,"Very well done Sir!!!  I think I am finally going to kick the old Williams to the curb, and start fishing with some of those Jigs.  I know where I can steel a couple old originals.."
892000,icefisherman,2015-01-13 21:01:00,952,"NAW, I do have few Williams spoons in my tackle box but have not used them at all for the pat couple years. Only use them when I cannot get them on the Meegs. And I usually do get them on Meegs. Much more pleasant and faster way to fish. Once one figure the jigging action of the Meegs no need to bother with the Williams. Let me know if you need I can hook you up with James himself the maker of those lures. He just did a large batch...drying out as I write this. Shouldn't be a problem to get some directly from him.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
