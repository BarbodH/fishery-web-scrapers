891991,jimmer,2015-01-13 19:48:00,2730,"I'm another one that won't freeze whitefish. The taste gets stronger and not as enjoyable. I also make sure I take off the dark fat deposit between the skin and the fillet. You can try BBQ on a cedar plank with your favourite spices, maybe a little hot pepper jelly spread on the fillet."
891992,Acountdeleted,2015-01-13 19:54:00,2562,"I salivate every time I read this recipe. If I land a whitefish, this is happening."
891506,Pikeslayer,2015-01-10 21:27:00,1443,"Got my first whitey today and have never cooked/baked one. Would appreciate some OFC recipes.  Thx, Slayer"
891507,misfish,2015-01-10 21:30:00,29133,"Well done Simon.  I just cut mine in 1"" strips. Coat with fish crisp and fry."
891508,chris.brock,2015-01-10 21:30:00,4053,"Not the healthiest way to go, but I like deep fried with an English style fish and chips beer batter"
891509,misfish,2015-01-10 21:34:00,29133,"Not the healthiest way to go, but I like deep fried with an English style fish and chips beer batter   Thats why I use fish crisp. It repels the oil off. But I do like your way Chris."
891511,Fisherman,2015-01-10 21:41:00,7201,"A bit of PAM on aluminum foil on a cooky sheet, lay the fillets down, baste with a stiff mix of mayo, real lemon juice and dill, bake for about 25 minutes at 325.  Don't forget to trim the dark mud line off the skin side."
891512,manitoubass2,2015-01-10 21:44:00,11391,"I caught/cooked my first one last year and it was delicious!  I gutted mine and cut out the blood line. stuffed with 3 garlic cloves, an onion and some potatoe chips.  I cant remember exactly the temps though???  Oh I baked it lol"
891514,bigugli,2015-01-10 21:51:00,6138,"Left whole, scaled and gutted. Rub cavity with salt and butter. Make a standard poultry stuffing, but add a can of crab meat or cocktail shrimp to the mix. Stuff the cavity and truss it shut. Drizzle lemon juice on outside. Wrap in foil. Bake in oven at 350F for at least 20 minutes."
891520,Pikeslayer,2015-01-10 22:18:00,1443,Definetly leaning toward baked so far. Mud line for sure will be trimmed.
891593,tender52,2015-01-11 06:07:00,270,"My recipe is fillet it. leave the skin on. This may sound stupid, but 3 drops of lime spaced out per fillet, a light dusting of cayenne pepper, pinch of onion salt. Tent in tinfoil, bbq 400F on top rack 20 min."
891596,Big Cliff,2015-01-11 09:43:00,6899,Smoked!

891611,Big Cliff,2015-01-11 15:07:00,6899,Out for more with Troy today Cliff. Got get more than one to bring to Lindsay;) Boy have I got some treats lined up for your next visit  Working on making bacon now!
891612,NAW,2015-01-11 15:14:00,4022,"I have to say fried up line Misfish stated is my favourite way.  Never tried smoked, but would really love to.  I have also backed the fillets on a cookie sheet.  But a point I might add about baking Try using parchment paper.  Nothing sticks to that stuff.  No Pam needed.  When I bake them I usually try different things.  Store bought rubs.  Italian dressings, home made rubs or maronades.  Google ""ginger glaze"" and see what comes up.  Tatsty"
891651,Motojoe,2015-01-11 19:56:00,21,"You can try to clean the fish first, put some olive oil, layer Fish Crisp-Jamaican Jerk slices of lemon, wrap with two layers of Tin Foil. Put in Oven for 20 mins( depends how big is the fish ). Oven - will smell very good, Grill - will have BBQ taste."
891663,akaShag,2015-01-11 21:15:00,2073,"BBQ fillets, skin on, or smoked.  Either way, leave the skin on, and skin DOWN for the whole process.  I don't think there is any bad way to eat whitefish, it is just lovely.  Doug"
891692,wallacio,2015-01-11 23:01:00,475,This recipe is amazing.   Simple but very tasty!  https://www.pinterest.com/pin/488218415827842660/
891700,akaShag,2015-01-11 23:16:00,2073,"back to wallacio, and warning to other users:  that link just attempted to do a malicious attack on my computer, detected by Norton 360.............."
891716,wallacio,2015-01-12 00:00:00,475,Thanks...I saw that after I posted.   Fixed with a link to a different site with the same recipe.
891735,irishfield,2015-01-12 01:15:00,26272,Just fillet it like any other fish.. EXCEPT... you MUST then cut the dark meat (blood line and muscle) off all the pieces. Then coat / batter / how ever you like your pickerel or any other fish and deep fry. Tastes like anything else if  you get rid of that dark mush!
891776,Freshtrax,2015-01-12 07:18:00,2215,Battered and cooked like cod!      Looks like the whitefish are cooperating this year!    Of course  I don't live near the lake any more.
891892,Sinker,2015-01-13 00:56:00,8692,"I find the trick with whities is to eat them fresh. Once you freeze them, they just arent the same. Even when they freeze on the ice I find they arent   as good.  I usually batter and deep fry them.  S."
891903,Pikeslayer,2015-01-13 01:40:00,1443,"Got 3 more Sunday my friend. Time for a trip to Sturgeon  Thx Wallacio. Big fan of JO. Going to try that with fillets from 1/2 the fish.  For sure Wayne. Gonna deep fry the other 1/2.  Dang!! Their cleaned & frozen but I've learned that baking partially frozen/thawed, results is much better after freezing??  Results to be posted."
891922,Algoma Guy,2015-01-13 03:36:00,19,I think there was a post that said lather it in mayo.  I totally agree but take it a step further and add mustard and cheese.  Dosent sound or look good but it tastes amazing.  It's great for kids or people who don't like a fishy taste. Either bake or wrap in foil  and bbq it.  Mud line removal is a must. Also don't forget to remove the pin bones especially from larger whiteys.
891924,Dara,2015-01-13 03:50:00,3052,"I like them stuffed and baked.  Bread in 3/4"" cubes, celery, salt and pepper, a couple squirts of lemon juice, diced onion.  bake uncovered whole with skin on.  Get rid of the mud line when you peel the skin off.  The crispy part of the stuffing is good but it gets mushy towards the middle"
