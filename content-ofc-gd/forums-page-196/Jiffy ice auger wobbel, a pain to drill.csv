892172,Bluegill,2015-01-14 22:22:00,197," Ya, tnx you guys. Just comming back from the basement... Bent it back and I think it looks way better now. Since I know now that the angle is not normal I bent it back. Here is the pic now. Will test it the next days and will write the result.  Tnx all for help!   "
892173,misfish,2015-01-14 22:27:00,29133,Awesome.
892322,ch312,2015-01-15 16:45:00,1590,"    Weird how mine appears the same as yours in the first pic and drills great yet yours works better after you bent it? At least you got it working, that's all that matters."

890465,misfish,2015-01-05 22:21:00,29133,"if you look close. it looks like the threaded shaft is bent,not the ripper.  The nuts dont run in a straight line. Anyone else see this? Maybe they came loose?  For sure, there,s something not right there.  Can you post a straight on shot as well?"
890469,Fisherman,2015-01-05 22:30:00,7201,"I'm going to throw this out, isn't the chipper blade supposed to go on the other side where the red line is?"

The nuts never came loose. Will try to make an other shot.  Tnx."
890473,misfish,2015-01-05 22:37:00,29133,What I see. 
890474,misfish,2015-01-05 22:39:00,29133,"I'm going to throw this out, isn't the chipper blade supposed to go on the other side where the red line is?   Im thinking the same thing. The blade should be protected by the shroud. Yes?"
890478,Fisherman,2015-01-05 22:58:00,7201,"Brian, take a close look at where the red line ends at the top of the photo.  Right there are the stamped ridges on the chipper blade.  If you install them on that side, the ridges don't allow that surface of the blade to lay flat against the bottom of the auger plate."
890480,misfish,2015-01-05 23:09:00,29133,Yup. See that. A front shot and another side shot from the other side would be nice to see.
890488,Bluegill,2015-01-05 23:38:00,197,"Yup. See that. A front shot and another side shot from the other side would be nice to see.  Orger was in the truck full of ice, took me a while :-) Here are 2 additional photos.  And tnx to the other guys. But there is no way to install the blade at the opposite site. Look at the knob and the ribs... there are extra openings for the ribs     "

890493,misfish,2015-01-05 23:46:00,29133,  It looks bent to me.
890495,irishfield,2015-01-05 23:48:00,26272,"Not disputing that Brian... looks like someone hammered it into the ice, but that should only change the blade angle and make it not cut right. I'll look at mine when I get home... but that could be Thursday or next week... unknown at this time!"
890497,misfish,2015-01-05 23:51:00,29133,Not disputing that Brian...  Just relaying what you said bud. The side angle looked like it was off as well.  Hope alls going well down there.

Wobble is generally the center peg being ice or dinged.. not the ripper.  Yes, that's why I ask if the kink is normal. I can see the whole kink up to the welding. If it's normal then I try other things. Never ever bumped it, the blade is fine as anybody can see.  "
890502,bare foot wader,2015-01-05 23:56:00,1354,"blade is supposed to mount on top, correctly as shown in the pic, that little bead prevents mounting on the bottom  a friend had one with similar issue, wobbled and cut poorly, but he was also rough on his auger, redrilled holes, put his body weight on top of it, so I blame him  ask jiffy if they will give you a discount on a new auger blade (no powerhead), doesn't hurt to ask  "
890505,bare foot wader,2015-01-06 00:02:00,1354,"those nuts are definitely fully tight? maybe sheared a bit and sitting funny?  I'd take the blade off, clean up the surfaces with a wire brush, maybe new nuts/bolts and remount...it looks like it is angled for sure"
890509,Fisherman,2015-01-06 00:08:00,7201,"Ya, mines on top, no space between the blade and mounting surface.  Look at the space and angle between Bluegills blade and mine.  Mine is more open, his is narrower.  I could only say that his has been wacked upwards.  [/url]"">http://"
890513,chris.brock,2015-01-06 00:34:00,4053,"Since Jiffy doesn`t seem too cooperative, I`d give it a little pry with the bar to be more square like Fisherman`s  Terry`s looks a little wacked too, it doesn`t wobble, it spins smooth?"

890672,ch312,2015-01-06 16:40:00,1590,"My 3 year old 10"" Jiffy stealth xt is the exact same as what the OP posted in the first picture. It's only seen 4-5 tanks of gas and I know it has not been banged on the ice as I am literally the only person who has used it after it left the factory.  When looking at the same angle as his first pic I can see that the bottom of the auger, where the ripper blade bolts on, is twisted slightly just like  in the first picture. in the middle it starts square with the shaft and twists slightly as it progresses towards the outside. It's easy to see this when looking at the bolts as one is on a slight angle as BB pointed out.  When looking at the sharpened edges of the ripper blade I can only assume this angle dictates how aggressive the ripper blade will be. The lower angle will ""rip"" into the ice less (original pic) where as more angle (after OP bent it) will mean more ""ripping"" into the ice?  More aggressive cut means faster drilling, but increased mechanical wear?     My auger burns through the ice with zero wobble..."
890673,ch312,2015-01-06 16:43:00,1590,"After looking at Terry's, that's 3 Jiffy's with the exact same twist. I'm gonna say it's supposed to be like that and you likely have a bent shaft causing the wobble.  Might want to test it on some local ice to see if it still works properly before heading off somewhere far just to find out you can't drill any holes..."
