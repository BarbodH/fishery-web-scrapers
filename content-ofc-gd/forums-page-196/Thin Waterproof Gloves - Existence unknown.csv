None of them worked for me.  1 XL was too tight and therefore cut off the circulation, couldn't keep them on long enough to find if they were waterproof...  2 the next pair was slightly bigger great fit, but every time I wore them they seemed to freeze solid after a while of gettting wet. I fell asleep wearing them in a snow storm fishing off a pier one night. I had wrapped the line around my hand in case I got a bite while I was out. I woke up and the line and glove were frozen together LOL. I almost broke the line getting it off the glove... When my fishing buddy showed up the next morning I was covered in 8"" of snow snoring away,  3 Great fit everywhere but the cuff so water would pool inside the glove and not run out  NO MORE neoprene gloves for me...."

They all either leak on teh back side of the hand, or my ""ice fishing"" neoprenes have holes cut in the finger tips for line tying...kind of stupid because the minute you catch a fish your gloves drain water straight into them rendering them useless.  It would be tough to purchase online as they would need to fit pretty perfectly.  Have I just discovered the so called golden egg idea...a concept that no one has ever solved?

I would suggest that before you address your glove problem, you consider looking into your circulation issue. Have you tried using a squeeze ball? Maybe consider taking up an instrument (guitar/piano) to help increase your circulation.

Looking at the way his hands move in them seems to make me believe they are the real deal.    As a footnote, I was at Al Flahertys on Monday and they had some sealskinz waterproof cotton gloves. Unfortunately they only had size XL, but they seem very very promising as well. I need to try some that are actually my size and see how the feel is. From what i could tell though, for the most part they felt just like your standard cotton gloves but slightly thicker."
887431,wormdunker,2014-12-18 10:54:00,1711,Not gloves but how about a waist muff which you slide your hands into when they are cold.  I just read another post about eglisheepfarm.com  They have a sheepskin muff which looks awesome.  I've been told there is a battery powered heated muff available.  They operate on the same principle as the heated jackets available at Home Depot & Marks.  When operating your gas auger make sure you point the exhaust away from your body.  I melted my previous muff by not paying attention!

884349,AKRISONER,2014-12-02 17:53:00,5558,"Hey Guys,  So as a lot of us here, I am year round fisherman, and very little weather scares me away from time on the water. Unfortunately I have suffered from terrible circulation in my hands my entire life.  Its so bad that half of the time I my body is radiating heat, yet my hands are ice cold. I am that guy you see wearing gloves with a t-shirt in the winter time.  Anyways, long story short, I typically wear gloves whenever I can because if my hands are warm, I dont even have to worry about what else I am wearing because I am going to be comfortable.  This past fall, i found a pair of underarmour running gloves in the winter mitts and touques bin at the cottage, so I started wearing them a lot. These gloves are perfect for fishing. They are tight, have fantastic dexterity and with the rest of my cold weather gear on they kept my hands relatively warm. Here is the only problem, they arent waterproof.  Non waterproof gloves and fishing, dont mix that well.  Here is where I am stuck...ive seen some stuff advertised on hunting websites, for all weather shooting gloves, however everything seems to come with a liner in them that makes the gloves have no feel. Other waterproof gloves are big and bulky or they dont have a nice tight stretchy fitment. Ive looked at some motocross gloves, but even the ones i have found seem to have a big liner in them, because i guess for most people if its warm out, who cares if your hands get wet.  So here I am reaching out to everyone here, is anyone aware of some thin waterproof gloves? Maybe some of you hunters out there are aware of a stretchy waterproof glove? Price doesnt even matter! I see Underarmour has a few things, but even then they all seem to be lined and heavy.  Id literally pay whatever someone is asking to solve this life long problem of cold wet hands. It can make for a really really long day of fishing when i cant use my fingers."

The closest I have found are 7.00 bucks a pair the surplus store here in town. They are camo, but not military. They windproof and 95% waterproof... I carry 2 pairs and switch to the second one when the first ones get damp. I just looked at them and they have no name on them so I can't tell you what brand they are. The have plastic dimples on the fingertips for grip and all the fingers made with the same material, so they all stay warm.  Unlike my 50.00 waterproof hunting gloves, they are great except for the trigger finger on each hand is a different material and it stays dry but that part of your hand freezes because that part must have less thinsulate or something to make it more flexible...  I have found though that most of the dampness I get in any good glove is from being stupid and not using a towel to dry my hands before I put them back into the glove after I have been baiting up or dealing with a fish."

I have taken to using the Hot Paws brand of fleece gloves for cold weather centerpinning. They are not waterproof. I also use the chemical toe warmers, with the adhesive that holds them in place. I use them stuck on the inside palm of the gloves. My buddy sticks them on the inside back of the gloves. Either way, they keep our hands toasty warm for more than 4 hours. I also carry a towel on my fishing vest, and make sure the hands are dry, after landing a fish. the old adage of ""an ounce of prevention, etc"" is correct."

If it's cold enough outside, you're looking at a layer of ice freezing onto the glove, and you're back to being cold. Only solution is to ensure that your gloves are taken off when landing a fish, and wiping dry before putting your gloves back on. At that rate, you can use any fleece, wool, or fancy glove you'd like that fits your requirements for warmth and dexterity The latex glove solution may work, but it might be too many layers for me to deal with."
