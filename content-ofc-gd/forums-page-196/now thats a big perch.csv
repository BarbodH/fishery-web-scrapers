892649,HTHM,2015-01-18 00:13:00,4082,"From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_perch The world record yellow perch (18 in., 4 lb. 3 oz.) was caught in 1865 from New Jersey, and is the longest standing record for freshwater fish in North America.[1] Anglers often refer to large yellow perch as ""jumbo perch"" or ""jack perch"".  Looking at that one makes me wonder."
