Being back in southern Ont has really put a damper on my abilty to get into quality fishing...but like everyone else this weather has got the itchy's goin to the point where I might get a rash soon! I am heading to mighty Simcoe in search of some decent weight on the end of the rod for Friday morning. Having never truely fished Simcoe for lakers I am going to go with obvious and head to Kemp  (also most direct for me) From all reports I have read it would appear that I am pretty safe to trek out anywhere from the south side...my only concern is that being a tourist to this mighty and formidable body of water I do not want to impose on those that sleep and eat beside her magnifigance on a daily basis... so can someone PLEASE clarify the parking rules and what not on this side.  I have several locations picked that look to me to be legal access (public areas,points, right of ways, traditional access points ect)...I am not concerned about parking a ways away and walking, thats part of the game. Just dont want to impose... Its been a long time since I have got to watch the video game and jig a tube...I will post the pics on Friday eve when I get back.  Cheers and hello to all again..  Dale"

I was on Couchiching around the same time some of the other guys were posting reports and had 5-8"" of ice but was told that Kempenfelt was still open, that was a few days ago though, things may have changed, just curious I suppose as I know the perch grounds and cooks bay had people on it"
892075,brkygetr,2015-01-14 03:26:00,425,"Easyfish, Thanks for the map. Do you have one with parking rules? Just joking..... those bullets are actually quite helpfull!! Basically I want to know if my truck will still be there when I get back if I just randomly park on a local street. Going to try to stay away from the main access points if possible...if not I guess I will join the crowds."
