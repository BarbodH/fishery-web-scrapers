891886,Guidofisherman,2015-01-13 00:26:00,206,"I finnally got around to tabulating the tagging results for the past year and will likely be the last such report. It ended up being a bit of a frustrated rant, but I decided to post anyway.          Brook Trout in the Nipigon system have gone through significant changes over the past 100+ years. Since the glory days of the “Gentlemen Anglers”, populations reached an all-time low in the 80’s due to anthropogenic factors like increased fishing pressure, habitat destruction, and introduction of exotic species. While it would be great  to return to the pristine brook trout fishing of the past, we must work together as fishermen and biologists to establish practices and conditions to ensure the future of this marvelous fishery for all to enjoy. Whether we like it or not, these fish are managed by the MNR and regulation changes need to be based on facts and data to protect the species from us. Regulations went from 15 fish or 10 pounds  prior to 1979,  to 2  over 18” , then 1 over 20” in 1997 and eventually to 1 at 22” in 2005.            I chose to be a part of the solution and gather the raw data through the tagging program (formally known as ‘The Co-operative Angler Program’) to see if the regulation changes made a positive impact. Although the program started in 1997, for the past 11 years, I and a few other brook trout enthusiasts have been gathering data about the fish we catch and forwarding it to the MNR biologists for analysis. Recaptured tagged brook trout allowed for the calculation of growth, movement, recapture rate, and population size. Generally, the data gathered included if possible: fish length, girth, weight, date, general location, sex, and fish health.Here are the combined results of the 2014 year for several of us only and does not represent the total data gathered by other anglers or the MNR.2014 data: (red graph)    120 fish tagged    20% of the population measured 20"" (highest spike)    43% of the population measured 19-21 "" (3"" range spike)    18.8” is the average length    27 recaptures or 22.5% of the annual population    9 fish recaptured multiple times within this year    8% of tagged fish were 22"" or greater    5% fish had mouth damage,hooks removed or lost maxilla plates     My tagging results of all 11 years are located here:http://members.shaw.ca/amuir/catchcharts.htmlThanks to the MNR biologists and staff that compiled this comprehensive 74 page document called,“Update on Brook Trout Rehabilitation in the Ontario waters of Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, and the Nipigon River:Public Workshop Proceedingshttp://www.thegreaterlakesuperiorfoundation.org/pdf/2011CoasterWorkshopProceedingsFINAL.pdfThese are a few of my personal highlights and interpretations of this data for South Bay in Lake Nipigon and the upper stretches of the Nipigon River since the 2005 regulation change to 22"":       87% of the spawning population is now protected     catch rate has improved in certain areas     the number of spawning fish has doubled yet remains at 25% of the management levels from the 1930’s     95% of all fishermen now use some form of “catch and release”     high recapture rates show brook trout in these areas are vulnerable to angling, but also indicates that these fish respond well to catch and release when performed properly.       an increase in the number of fish caught that have mouth damage, hooks removed or lost maxilla plates     generally, there are more fish and they are bigger          There are still a lot of unanswered questions and challenges for the Nipigon brook trout without even getting into the plight of Lake Superior Coasters. History has shown over fishing, environmental abuse and decline, and while the species is still fragile, there are  signs of improvement.Here are a few recommendations from the report:  participants expressed concern over limited information available for Lake Superior brook troutcollect more information on both brook trout populations (abundance, size, & distribution), and their associated sport fisheries (angler catch & harvest)brook trout in the upper reaches of the river and Lake Nipigon are a separate population and therefore, should have its own management plana formal research plan should be developed that includes a brook trout life history study and sustainability goalsgoals should be prioritized for monitoring, assessment, research and management actions for long term preservation of the speciesrefine and expand programs like the Co-operative Angler Program, Creel Survey studies and Education programs         These can’t be answered without planned actions, research and programs to ensure brook trout sustainability. Since the 74 page report was released in 2011, to my knowledge, no additional information has been released by the MNR or communicated actions taken on the recommendations. The MNR continues to experience cut backs to programs and personnel and I want input as part of the fishing public. With the retirement of Nipigon biologist Rob Swainson after 30+ years, The Co-operative Angler Program seems to have run its course and is now in limbo.  It has been a lot of work for me and others, but I felt it was necessary to contribute rather than just sit back and complain about the condition of our fishery. After all, what is the alternative for making sustainability decisions? The program was about gathering data to make informed decisions and educate, not about personal glory or bragging any more than someone who publishes a “grin” shot, as we all do from time to time.         I tried to do my part and contribute, but now it is time to just enjoy the fishing.  …and what are you doing?   "
891891,Sinker,2015-01-13 00:50:00,8692,"OMNR is a pretty sad set up these days. Its not the mnr staff, but the politics behind them. It maddens and saddens me at the same time. Such a waste of resources in this province, and always put on the back burner until its too late.  Thanks for your effort. I thoroughly enjoyed reviewing your report. Interesting to say the least.  S."
891893,chris.brock,2015-01-13 00:59:00,4053,"Very cool that you are putting the effort into helping that unique fishery. I can tell you're pretty passionate about that system.  A couple questions- Is a recaptured fish a tagged fish?, from that same year, or from the length of the study?  Do you think angling samples all year classes equally? Baits and techniques might be more appealing to certain sizes of fish.  This could be the way of the future, guys like yourself, doing the sampling and working with the MNR."
891926,Algoma Guy,2015-01-13 04:16:00,19,"Very interesting and kudos to you for putting all that info together.  I have a couple questions as well but after you have answered Chris's questions first of course.  Do,you think there will ever be a fishable coaster brookie population around the Sault ste Marie area?  I thought I read somewhere once that 50 fish days were possible back in the day."
891946,wormdunker,2015-01-13 11:08:00,1711,Thanx for your efforts!  Very informative.  The pic of you holding that brookie in such a beautiful setting is the best pic I've ever seen!  Awesome!
891967,Guidofisherman,2015-01-13 14:48:00,206,"The recapture rate that I posted is for fish caught over multiple years, sometimes over 3 or 4 years. This has often shown a growth of up to 3 inches per year, but it tapers off as the fish matures and puts more energy into bulk rather than length. The MNR biologists however, determine recapture rate from within the same year. I am told this provides a better determination for population estimates. Yes, I think angling samples most year classes equally, although I doubt for the smolt or younger fish.  In this habitat, it is rare to catch a fish under 8 inches. Basically, the baits and techniques have remained constant over the years, but if you look at the graphs, you can see the average size changes from year to year in a cycle of growth. Most fishermen don't purposely target smaller fish with their baits or techniques but, it is beneficial to tag the younger fish in the hopes of recapture to determine population estimates of size, numbers etc. The one thing I have noticed that is not in the MNR report is that my data clearly shows that the larger fish get the better feeding locations. Because I record the specific locations of each fish caught, when it is caught again, I can track its movements.  Generally, as a fish grows, it moves to the better spots ...a real pecking order. It just proves something that most fishermen already know. I'm talking over multiple years, not just seasonal shifts or water temperture changes.   Do you think angling samples all year classes equally? Baits and techniques might be more appealing to certain sizes of fish. "
891969,jayess,2015-01-13 14:53:00,187,"For what it's worth, I appreciate the published results of studies. I was extremely disappointed when results from the angling surveys for Algonquin Park first became limited in content (namely, the removal of comments) and then the entire study became limited in distribution/collection (only running out of Opeongo). I don't know where it's at now, but it's certainly not as story-telling for me as it used to be.  Just to be clear, no hard feelings on the folks running such surveys and studies. I understand logistics, funding, etc. get in the way of intentions."
891972,Guidofisherman,2015-01-13 15:19:00,206,"Opps....forgot to hit the multquote button. The state of the MNR has degraded significantly over the years. We have allowed politicians to reduce budgets and change priorities from sustainability issues based on data to an organization forced to justify those political decisions. It is up to the fishing clubs and organizations to influence change and hold those in charge accountable. Volunteers like myself can be helpful, but we are not biologists. As for the brook trout fishery in the Sault area...I can only agree that there once was a significant popultion there at the turn of the century. Regretably, I suspect we can only hope for a minimal improvement if we address the anthroprogenic issues that got us into the decline."
891975,solopaddler,2015-01-13 16:57:00,8605,"Interesting, thanks for posting. Looking at your data from last season it seems that there was 9 really dumb trout thrown into the mix. As far as the amount of damage, torn mouths, etc, I've seen that myself elsewhere. On the upper Kenai in Alaska pretty much every fish you catch has grossly mishapen mouths from having been caught numerous times. Kind of put a damper on the experience for me, but then the alternative - no trout left - is even less appealing.  If I had any input in what's going on up there I'd stress the impoprtance of proper fish handling more than anything else and push single barbless hooks."

Same thing on the Miramichi River in New Brunswick. It makes you wonder just how many times some of those salmon are caught over the course of a season. And that's with using single barbless flies."
892380,Moosebunk,2015-01-16 01:55:00,3970,"Why we have still not sat down for a scotch together Al is baffling me right now.  Your efforts are certainly personal for you, and quite interesting and of course important to others.  Enjoyed reading this post very much, and thanks for putting it together.  The efforts and regulations must be helping, for it seems every year the speck fishing on Nipigon gets better.  You are right though, some beat of fish caught from time to time but, at least they're being ""re-caught.""  Hoping it keeps getting better over the next decade."

You are absolutly right that the key is proper fish handling and that includes the amount of time you play the fish, time out of the water, grip and revival.  It even includes equipment choice like trebles vs singles, and line weight so you are not just haul'n them in'. About the 9 dumb fish...as Craig questioned, ""just how many times are these fish actually caught?"" I have often wondered that myself given that my recapture data is only for 2 'taggers' and doesn't include the times that fish is caught and released by other anglers.  Why we have still not sat down for a scotch together Al is baffling me right now.  Your efforts are certainly personal for you, and quite interesting and of course important to others.

We do need to make a point of getting together next year for a sit down chat rather than just pass each other in our boats whispering, ""look at that, he just caught another one!"" I also agree it is as bit disappointing to catch a fish with recap damage or even a tag in it, thinking we are in pristine waters, but at least we seem to be catching more and bigger average fish. Now if I could only find that world record fish???"
892506,trevy727,2015-01-16 23:21:00,351,wonderful report. Very good information.
892564,fishindevil,2015-01-17 10:18:00,6254,Great readers of information !! And yes too bad the MNR keep getting their budgets slashed as well and you are very passionate about your work thanks for doing it !!! I agree barbless hooks no trebles  and proper handling is critical !!!
