891957,Garnet,2015-01-13 13:11:00,2056,The pallet factory in Bowmanville puts out scrap wood that includes pallets sometimes. East of Liberty on baseline.
891965,DanD,2015-01-13 14:43:00,2223,"If you're thinking of picking up pallets from any of the places mentioned; make sure you get permission to take them. The one store I share the building with, has had a number of people charged with theft and trespassing, while they were trying to take pallets and other items; that the store owner keeps outside behind the building. The private security company that patrols our area usually catches them midnight shopping.  Dan."
891997,jedimaster,2015-01-13 20:51:00,3472,How many are you looking for? I get them free here but I am in BC. We have a warehouse in woodbridge that would also likely have HT pallets for free. We use them a few times and when a piece cracks we have to pay to dispose of them. I use the for kindling and building some outdoor type stuff.

892170,lakerguy,2015-01-14 22:15:00,224,"If you can get them from a brick company,they would be hard wood skids then just a thought"
892180,DanD,2015-01-14 23:15:00,2223," of course, i emailed a couple local places early this morning, just waiting to hear back from them  Sorry I didn't mean that you wouldn't ask first; it's just some people think these skids are junk, going to the landfill. Some skids have deposits on them that the supplier that sent whatever product on these skids wants them back. My post was meant as a heads up; so you or anyone else didn't get in trouble for such a small thing.  Dan."

892386,FloatnFly,2015-01-16 03:20:00,1640,"I think that you will need pallets like this .   its not the shape of the pallet or size, you have to disassemble them, its more the distressed wood look that your after, and since pallets are a little roughed up, it makes them really nice for making rustic furniture"
