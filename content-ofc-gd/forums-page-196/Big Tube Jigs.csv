892550,adempsey,2015-01-17 04:04:00,1498,"Those are huge!  They look like they should have come in a non-descript brown paper wrapped package, lol.    Wasn't Canyon Plastics the first to come out with a plastic tube jig?"
892553,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-17 04:26:00,10439,"Yep, they brought out the original Gitzit."
892556,4x4bassin,2015-01-17 04:58:00,1025,"I like those , might have to be getting me some !"
892565,misfish,2015-01-17 10:26:00,29133,"Thanks Dave,  Not sure I need tubes that big here,but that jig on the right would work nice."

892583,solopaddler,2015-01-17 13:31:00,8605,"Excellent, so I'll be geared up nicely when I visit in April."
892593,OhioFisherman,2015-01-17 16:16:00,6623,Might be a decent thing to use for pike or skis?
892598,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-17 17:02:00,10439,"Excellent, so I'll be geared up nicely when I visit in April.  I'll rent to you at a reasonable rate Mike."
892599,solopaddler,2015-01-17 17:29:00,8605, I'll rent to you at a reasonable rate Mike.   Trade   This     For This  
892606,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-17 18:37:00,10439,"Nope, the bottle is worth less than the jigs. Even at my prices up here."
892610,misfish,2015-01-17 18:59:00,29133,"Dave, the jig head that I like,the one on the right,will it slide into a four inch tube or are they to thick for that?  I bought these jigs. I thought they would of slid right in a 4.5 inch tube,but I had to warm it up and stretch it over it. Ending up splitting the back tail end. The weight is 1 oz.  I had three chasers this morning, but no hook ups.     "
892615,lew,2015-01-17 19:30:00,12766,Might be a decent thing to use for pike or skis?  A friend of mine does very well with them for muskies Paul.
892657,akaShag,2015-01-18 01:57:00,2073,"Did you not catch any ciscoes with the spring run up there?  1.  Or are ciscoes illegal for ice fishing?  2.  Or do you forego ciscoes in favour of artificials?They sure played hell with the lakers on Great Slave Lake last July.................our biggest was 42 pounds, and I forget how many over 20 pounds but several dozen...........  Doug"
892660,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-18 02:17:00,10439,"OH, I have a freezer full of ciscoes. The run is in October.      I always have a dead stick with a cisco going and jig with my second line."
892699,akaShag,2015-01-18 13:46:00,2073,"Understood.  I had wrongly assumed that the ciscoe run was a spring time thing, like smelts down here.  My buddy up there had a limit of ciscoes in his freezer for the summer GSL fishing.  Doug"
