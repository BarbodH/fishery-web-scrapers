They moved a ways away and were circled again and had to leave. Read the article  Anybody want to head to Long point Bay and go aboard their boat?
109439,Riparian,2007-08-31 22:02:00,269,Theres alot of people that live in this province that dont even realize that over half of the electricity we generate is from coal. They think its all nuclear and hydro electric.  No wonder our air quality sucks.
109462,pikehunter,2007-08-31 23:20:00,1659,What slogan should we paint on their boat?
109469,Clampet,2007-09-01 00:27:00,1947,Busted!
109476,fatherof3,2007-09-01 01:10:00,1769,saw that on the news
109502,danbouck,2007-09-01 03:21:00,4380,I'm thinking that we clean some fish and dispose of the guts on their boat!
109503,Douger,2007-09-01 03:22:00,116,the arctic sunrise will be in toronto harbour this weekend and is open for tours.
109592,Greencoachdog,2007-09-01 23:49:00,8163,Damn Hippies!!
109595,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-01 23:57:00,2585,well we can shut the plant down.  but then we would have to electricity for the gas pumps to work.  which would leave us on shore instead of fishn=ing in our gas powered boas.  On another note.  There used ot be a greenpeace pain in the a-- that lived a few streets from me. (always coming by with flyers and crap) His wife sure looked smoking hot in her gas guzzling escalade!  Arrest them and through away the key!  Cheers!
109626,pikehunter,2007-09-02 02:52:00,1659, I am not surprised!
109946,holdfast,2007-09-03 19:11:00,1813,"They should be arrested for being STUPID.  Really, Isn't there a law for crossing private property.  IE Rappelling up a ship.  What would I be charged with if I dangled off the side of the CN Tower.  First of all they would put me away to get my head examined, what about those Idiots that chain themselves endangering themselves or the cost of removing them.  I say Jail them. Get their heads examined, and sue them for every penny that is wasted on their shenanigans.  If not cut them off social assistance"
109989,lazybum,2007-09-03 23:03:00,142,They will just get more donations from the bleeding hearts to bail them out.  I guess that their own ship doesn't use fuel that emit gasses and pollutants into the air.
110135,BITEME,2007-09-04 13:09:00,1969,   ARE YOU SURE WE WERENT SEPERATED AT BIRTH
110143,Headhunter,2007-09-04 13:17:00,5703,"What disturbs me most about these morons, is the fact that they don' t EVER offer viable alternatives, they only complain and disrupt! Oh, that and the fact that they target younger people for money and support, when in reality, the younger people following them have only seen one side of the story... GP's side! A little creative torpedoing will help to solve the problem! (PS... they must have been having a fit over the weekend as those fuel guzzling jets in the air show flew over head!) HH"
110153,LeXXington,2007-09-04 13:34:00,1928,"Find all the activist and cut off everything that is powered by electric.  Water, has to be pumped and cleaned Heat etc.  Wonder how long it would take before they complain.  I read that they new this was going to happen and let them board rather than stopping them because the negitive publicity would be worse.  Could be worse, could have been P3TA"
110205,Gerritt,2007-09-04 16:39:00,6129,Funny how people love David Suzuki... but his foundation works with GreenPeace etc... then they are up in arms about GreenPeace.. but still love David Suzuki....   Gerritt.
110220,Riparian,2007-09-04 17:49:00,269,Do you think thats biodegradable paint they are using to paint the side of the freighter?  http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/recent...-arctic-sunrise
110251,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-04 19:35:00,957,They're not for anything and produce nothing.   Just a bunch of blood suckers against Capitalism.
110308,Gerritt,2007-09-04 23:53:00,6129,Just see what their executives get paid... mind boggling...   Gerritt.
