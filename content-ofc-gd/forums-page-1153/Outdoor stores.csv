109972,MJL,2007-09-03 21:52:00,2427,"The times I was down in Buffalo, I stopped in at Dick's Sporting goods and Gander Mountain."
109978,silveradosheriff,2007-09-03 22:34:00,1025,I like Gander mountain.
109985,lazybum,2007-09-03 22:49:00,142,Dick's Sporting Goods is in the Walden Galleria Mall. Gander Mountain is about 15-20 minutes from Walden Galleria.

110008,Fishnfool,2007-09-04 00:09:00,1,Dick's Sporting Goods is in the Walden Galleria Mall is better choice (old Galyans purchased by Disk's). Gander Mountain is in the middle of moving store around for fall season. Fishing department is being moved hunting dept. is intact.

I would call them to see if they are back in the swing of things......but sounds like your closer to Dicks anyway. There are many Dicks locations in the area, but Galleria is the largest with the biggest selection"
