It is full of pictures and the system does NOT allow me posting ""so many pictures""?!? Not sure what the ""limit"" is but maybe the admins can allow me one time exception considering I haven't posted anything in last 20 days and am now simply using all my pictures allowed in one shot??? It is very detailed report with some great photos and I am sure many members will enjoy reading it. It wouldn't be right to start deleting pictures. So........please give me a break once  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

I do use photobucket but provide direct links and it shows here on the board as the pictures themselves instead of the links to them. Anyhow....I'll try splitting the report in two...hope it goes this way.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
