110456,bigfish1965,2007-09-05 14:14:00,3382,"We were just having some routine maintenance done. Every two weeks we have the guys at IPS do a bunch of load tests and stuff. Usually only takes them an hour to finish. I also have them try and brute force attack the site once a month and since we have a few settings looser here than what is SOP, that takes them longer. If you've ever seen a site destroyed by a hacker you'll know why we go through this. It is a minor inconvenience and gives some people something to talk about."
110457,lew,2007-09-05 14:16:00,12767,"Everything is back up to normal speed again on my end, so thanks to whoever is responsible"
110459,lew,2007-09-05 14:17:00,12767,"Thanks Rick, we were posting at the same time."
