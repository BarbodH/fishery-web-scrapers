109988,lazybum,2007-09-03 22:54:00,142, Where are you located?
110002,Targa01,2007-09-03 23:32:00,46,"I am located in Timmins, But I am going to Toronto Tommorow and can stop anywhere in between to get leeches."
110011,bassmaster4,2007-09-04 00:35:00,801,i was in timmins a couple of weeks ago and asked for leeches in a bait store in gogama and the clerk told me leeches are done all over ontario for the rest of the year
110014,stuntman,2007-09-04 00:43:00,96,"Can't say for sure who has leeches and who doesn't.....don't they sell leeches in Timmins?  If you are coming down the 400 try Bass Pro Shop.  On the way you will also hit a few fishing tackle stores on the North bound side.  There is a Lebaron's on Woodbine avenue, I know they have a vending machine for worms.   If all else fails....try Gulp Alive.....  Stuntman"
110017,MJL,2007-09-04 00:50:00,2427,Angling Specialties in Scarborough has leeches but only in small sizes with possibly a few dozen medium ones left.  Jumbos were gone a month ago.  Best to call ahead.
110025,gone_fishin,2007-09-04 01:04:00,481,"i believe Tightline in Pickering has leeches, don't know if that's too far out of the way... you should call in advance first though."
110027,2kj,2007-09-04 01:15:00,77,"I love fishing with leeches, live ones, but the Gulp Alive works almost as well, good enough for someone who does not use leeches to notice any difference.  Bass Pro Shops."
