Unfortunately the fish had other plans. We did end the day with fishin a 10' deep weedline and hammered a pile of jumbo perch, huge WGSF, a few Blueys and a giant Sunny. Called it a day by 3pm. I would like to thank Rich for his input and we will definitely try it out again. Headed to Sturgeon on Sunday am. Launched, fished hard for Skis in an area we know produces but NADDA. Trolled and drifted back to our launch and started hammering the jumbo perch and picked up a few table fair eyes to boot. Had a great weekend out with my wife and hope to get back to Sturgeon L. soon.  "

110130,ccmtcanada,2007-09-04 13:05:00,7971,Great report!  The bite on Saturday was tough....I'm thinking that cold front probably had a lot to do with it.  Looked like a great time out there!
