Can anyone offer some tips on techniques at this time of year? I'm still pretty green (especially with fly gear) and would like to increase my odds on catching a larger fish this time around as I don't get the chance often. So far I've only managed smaller fish in the 6"" range.  The Saugeen doesn't have the strict regs, so I wouldn't be opposed to casting/drifting tips if I get up that way...  Thanks in advance C2F"
