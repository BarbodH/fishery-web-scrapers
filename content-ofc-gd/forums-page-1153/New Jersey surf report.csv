110506,ecxstriper,2007-09-05 16:02:00,343,"Holiday weekends provide me much need fishing time as I work  6 days a week. I decided to head down to Sandy Hook to do three days of surf  fishing. It is not far about an hour drive. I went down Saturday night to fish  the incoming tide for Blues and Strippers action was slow but steady caught  several Sea robins and two Blues, forgot camera phone in the truck sorry.  Sunday I went down to late again to fish over night with a  night pass (Sandy Hook is a national park and closes at sundown) but the park  service cancelled night passes for Sunday night. I was able to fish for 3 hrs  but only had one hit.  Monday I got up at 5:00 am Low Tide was at 6:49 am and I  want to be on the Beach fishing before the tide switched to incoming. Incoming  tide in most places is better fishing the tide brings baitfish close to the  beach. Stopped off at my favorite bait shop for squid strips, finger mullet,  clams and peanut bunker. The weather was great sunny and warm prefect with an  on shore breeze. The beach was crowded but not to bad I only had to walk about  Â¾ mile to find a spot to set up .New Jersey allows anglers to fish as many rods  as they want so when surf fishing I use 3 rods with bait and keep a 4th  rod with a plug or spoon ready if the blue fish decide to run the beach chasing  bait fish. Unfortunately this never happened I did however see several shoals  of peanut bunker (a type of bait fish) feeding on the surface though out the  day.   The action started  as soon as I got my third rod in the water first fish was Sea Robin, which I  kept up for more bait their filets work really well for blues. I fished for 11  hrs ended up catching 60 + Sea robins (stopped counting after 60), 4 flounders  (kept one for dinner), 1 Skate and 2 severally sun burned feet  , note to self  wear water socks next time. I also remembered to bring lucky spoon which I  received as a Christmas present from Bly, if I don't bring this I don't catch  fish oh and one more note to self talk on phone to girlfriend when fishing.  This always brings good action and keeper size fish to the shore, all flounder  where caught while I was talking to her.    I ended up using most of my bait and gave the rest to two kids fishing  as I left. I took several pictures but could not find them in my phone once I  got home. I had a real nice shot of a Sea Robin with the New York skyline in  the background. I find it pretty cool to be fishing in the Atlantic Ocean with  in sight of New York, if I where to swim east the next land mass would be  Spain.                     All in all it was a great weekend with surf, sun and  fish. "
