110180,Seaweed,2007-09-04 14:50:00,135,Does anyone really understand this whole onboard Battery Charger issue.  I thought I did.  Recently I have just somehow managed to mess up my second battery charger in 5 years.  I had a ProMariner12 for three years.  Worked great.  No hassles.  Then one day the charging LED light refused to come on anymore.  Long story short I was never really confident that my batteries were getting fully charged anymore so... out it came and I installed another unit this year to replace this old one.  I did keep the old one though... why I don't know I hang on to old stuff.  Long story short... this past weekend after a run to Belleville and back where I had the unit plugged in at my Son's place and I verified by checking the lights .... out we went fishing...no problem.  I trailer the boat home.  Go to plug it in.... no lights...nothing not a Power light and no Charging light either.  I checked all the connections and fuses.  Everything looks good.  Checked the power cord and it ran a fan fine.  So my question to you folks is.... what the heck am I doing to these charges or are they just a prone to problems?  I run two Deka Marine batteries in a 24v series to a Motorguide 67 Brute Electric motor.  This is all that is connected to my chargers.  Any help or info would be greatly appreciated.  I have contacted the maker of the chargers and will post any reply I get from them.
110186,Billy Bob,2007-09-04 15:22:00,5865,Sorry to hear you are having problems with the onboard charging systems. I have had this one for 4-5 years now without a problem and it has definitely extended both my batteries. When the boat is in the garage I have a extension cord hanging from the ceiling and it will automatically disconnect when I forget to disconnect manually (MANY TIMES) in the morning since I will have the boat hooked up to the truck the night before.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true

If you charge the battery(s) for 24 hours, then unhook them from the chargers and let them sit for 12 hours, not hooked up to anything, a fully charged battery should still read 12.65 volts with a good digital meter."
110264,Tacklebuster,2007-09-04 21:12:00,303,"My charger gave up on me last year, it was good while it lasted.  I spoke with the marina, and he told me that they really only last around 3 yrs.  I had mine for about 4 years so I guess it did its job.  I don't know why they don't last longer, I think they should.  Perhaps the pounding they get is too much, and over time they can't handle it.  Its not as convenient, but I just decided to replace it with a portable charger.  I figured I need one anyhow for storing the batteries over the winter, and for the price those on board ones need to last longer than 3 years."
110269,Terry,2007-09-04 21:32:00,14456,my on board charger lasted 9 years and it was still working  when I sold the boat.... mine was called something like guest pro 2 or along that line
110277,lew,2007-09-04 22:33:00,12767,"I purchased my boat new in 1999 and installed a Guest 2611, dual bank charger for my 2 deep cycles and it's still working flawlessly to this day and I charge my batteries constantly.  I'm still on the original bateries too."
110343,John Bacon,2007-09-05 01:23:00,3277," The pounding has hurt my 15+ year old portable charger that is stored in the front of my boat.  I had to put a new plug on it this year, but it still keeps my batteries charge.  I have seen some of those on board charges selling for $500+ ... I would be pretty upset if it only lasted three years."
