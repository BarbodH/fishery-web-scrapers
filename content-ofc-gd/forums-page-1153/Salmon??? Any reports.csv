110240,ccmtcanada,2007-09-04 18:53:00,7971, An article in today's Star...we had the driest summer in 50 years...and forecast for fall is drier and warmer than normal....  http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/252979
110243,ranger520vx,2007-09-04 19:11:00,164,Maybe you can do a raindance and get the river volume up to get these Salmon moving?
109101,kellyann.nicholas,2007-08-30 19:21:00,6,"Ok so yes I am a chick and absolutely love to fish.  Any reports on where the action is best for Salmon fishing?  I am from north of Hamilton and normally head out to Port Hope this time of year, which is where I caught my 40 lbd salmon two years ago, and even when the fish aren't bitin....I catch my limit.  Any reports would be really great  Thanks a buch guys Kelly"
109104,Canuck2fan,2007-08-30 19:32:00,1444,"Welcome Kelly, I don't know about the salmon on Lake Ontario, there have been some scattered reports but it seems to be hit or miss. I can say that on Lake Huron if you don't have a boat bring your bass gear if you really want to catch fish...  That could change though if we get a string of 10 degree nights though....."
109114,Mike Pike,2007-08-30 19:47:00,1332,You must be a pretty good angler because you have no problems stretching the truth!  lol  Welcome to the board Kelly!

109147,kellyann.nicholas,2007-08-30 21:28:00,6,"I will upload pictures later to verify the story, Ok so I told a little white lie my husband just informed me that it was 39 not 40, but I'll still add the picture later.  Plus I was just out fishin for the fun of it and was not aware of the derby...sucks to be me I would have loved a new truck, boat and trailer.  I'll keep that in mind for next time.  Can't wait to get out there this year and show the boys how it's done! SMILES"
109153,Canuck2fan,2007-08-30 21:49:00,1444,I thought one of the rules for the derby was that the fish had to be caught on a boat out of the harbour?
109162,fatherof3,2007-08-30 22:47:00,1769,welcome to the board
109163,setomonkey,2007-08-30 22:55:00,872,Welcome to the board.  I'd like to see the pictures of that big salmon when you get a chance to upload them...  Mike
109178,glen,2007-08-31 00:03:00,2641,I dont have a problem with you rounding off 39lbs to 40lbs.  Where is the pic?
109204,danbouck,2007-08-31 01:26:00,4380,I've got room in my boat if you catch your limit every time!
109226,stuntman,2007-08-31 02:23:00,96,I was down at the Oshawa pier a few nights ago 9:30-11pm. They were turning and 1 out of the 5 people fishing caught one that looked like 7lbs to me.  Everyone was using those glow in the dark cleo's.  On the topic of glow in the dark cleos.  Is it legal to illuminate them with artificial light and then fish with them?  Stuntman
109228,MJL,2007-08-31 02:30:00,2427," Provided that the light is part of the actual lure, it's legal.  You can't use lights (like lanterns or powerful flashlights) to attract fish to your area.  From what I've been told, the light (from lanterns) attracts small bait fish which in turn attract bigger fish to your area."
109230,stuntman,2007-08-31 02:52:00,96,So does that mean if I get one big honking lure (with a minnow trailer of course).  that would be legal? Anyone know how to water proof a coleman lamp and ad hooks to it?  Stuntman
109391,kellyann.nicholas,2007-08-31 19:42:00,6,"Gonna be hittin Bronte tonight boys, there are sure to be some new pictures for yous tomorrow along with the pics that I have promised...have to dig them out and scan them for you.  Thanks for all the welcomes...yous are a great group.  Stay Tuned..."

109461,Roy,2007-08-31 23:18:00,13728,What's the drinking water like in Waterdown?
109559,.goneFishing.,2007-09-01 17:32:00,10,How is Salmon fishing from shore in Port Hope ? Any reports ? Have they started coming in ?   
109701,mikeymikey,2007-09-02 17:53:00,376,  Still wait for some pictures!  Including that 40lb'er
109747,.goneFishing.,2007-09-02 21:58:00,10,I think its taker her that long b/c she is using photoshop to enlarge that 40lb salmon.
109749,CLofchik,2007-09-02 22:15:00,854,Did it look something like this?    Bronte between 03:00-6:00  has been decent for the last week.
109808,mikeymikey,2007-09-03 03:11:00,376," Oh nice,,, that is one beautiful fish you got there... Were you the only one who caught that nice/morning ?"
110215,lazybum,2007-09-04 17:16:00,142, Where's our new friend KellyAnn?     Waiting for DouG to personally kya is just killing us.
110216,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-04 17:20:00,698,Nights are getting cooler. Looks like the lake's cooling down as well. Prime time coming up for river mouth salmon fishing.  http://www.coastwatch.msu.edu/ontario/o1.html
110228,.goneFishing.,2007-09-04 18:34:00,10,No rain forecast.   We need some damn rain. The other problem is that in other areas where i fish for salmon have low water levels and the Natives have put up the nets.   The salmon is probably chilling in deep waters and waiting for colder temperatures and higher water levels.
