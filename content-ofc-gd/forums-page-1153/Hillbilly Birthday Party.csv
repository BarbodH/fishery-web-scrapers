110355,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-05 02:13:00,957,"My son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter Caroline spent part of Saturday climbing Mt. LeConte, in the Great Smoky Mountains.  Their hike up was around seven miles, with a 3800 foot gain in elevation.  The camp is at 6593 feet.  Caroline rode up in Spencer's backpack and Lori carried diapers, toys and food for Caroline.  It was hot and humid at the beginning of the hike.  They went up the mountain for a private birthday party for Caroline who turns one year old September 12.  Here's a break to rest and tank up on fluids.   They were still drenched with perspiration when they reached the top, but the much cooler air temperature had them bringing out warmer clothing.   I can walk, but don't want to until after my birthday.   I'm on top of the world.   Caroline is ready for her ride back down the mountain.  They spent the night in camp where their meals were served.  There's no road to the top.  Supplies are brought in by surefooted llamas.   Going down is easier.   Lori crossing a creek.  Either I got the photos out of order or Lori changed into lighter clothing as they neared the bottom of the mountain and ran into hot, humid air.   little c feeding a squirrel near the bottom.    They made it to the bottom of Mt. LeConte midafternoon on Sunday.  Little c and Lori headed home to complete a work project and Spencer stayed behind to make a solo whitewater paddling trip down the Ocoee River.  His canoe trip was going well until he had an urgent bathroom call while heading downstream.  He found a calm stretch of water and quickly got off the water and out of sight of other paddlers.  He squatted and did his business, and then did some more business.  Then he noticed movement directly under his bottom and he was not causing the movement.  Looking down he saw a three foot copperhead slithering away.  Fortunately copperheads are not aggressive."

110502,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-05 15:58:00,0,"That's a great report Connie, nothing hillbilly about that at all.  The smokey mountains are one of my favorite places.  Is Leconte one of the highest mountains ?...I can't remember.  A few from our trip there this past easter....It was a little cool this night..       Ran into this guy through the park...   and saw this mother and her cubs...a good distance away though.. "
110510,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-05 16:27:00,957,"Mount LeConte is third highest in the Park.  Clingman's Dome is a bit higher at 6643 feet.  Not a hillbilly report?  You should see where my son lives.  In his younger days he fished Roaring River in nearby Jackson County.  He later bought a bottom farm that ran along the river.  There was no house so he converted the tool shed into living quarters and lived there until the farm was paid for.  Then he built a house and got over being a hermit by taking a bride.  They do a lot of paddling, hiking, biking, running and horse back riding.  Their house is located in a valley near the river.  Dogs, chickens and birds start looking for a place to bed down around 4 in the afternoon when the sun drops down over Overton Mountain.  When their road is closed due to flooding, my son takes his canoe downstream to the first bridge and hitch hikes 18 miles to work.  When he was converting his tool shed into a place to live, he'd walk a 200 feet to the river and catch a couple of fish to fry on his Coleman stove.  Then back to work.  Roaring River was also his bath tub for a couple of months.  I wonder what the poor copperhead thought as he looked up?"
