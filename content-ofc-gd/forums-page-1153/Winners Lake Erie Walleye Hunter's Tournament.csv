109925,Fishmaster,2007-09-03 18:06:00,920,"Lake Erie Walleye Hunters 1st annual Tournament was a great success...  We had 20 boats turn out for the event which began with a 6:00am shotgun start from the Port Maitland Pier.  Still dark, running up the river in a light fog was the perfect way to begin the day... Kudos to Bill for stopping to help a fellow fisherman on the way out!  A big thanks to Riverside Marina for allowing us to use their facilities at the public docks! Next year will be even better.   Prizes were awarded as follows,  1st Place $600.00  went out to ""Icebreaker's Team"" @ 32.2lbs  2nd Place $300.00  went to ""Sonny's Team"" @ 29.37lbs  3rd Place $100.00   went to ""Fishmasters Team"" @ 27.50lbs   Calcutta $340.00  was awarded to ""Sonny"" @ 10.06lbs   Great bunch of people!  Look at those fish!  Well done!   Winning Box went to the guys from the USA, nice catch guys!   All the boxes were close with fish like this coming to the scales.   Day full of smiles for everyone!   This was one of those days when you couldn't keep the rods in the water, it was one fish after the other.  A great fish fry afterwards and a nice freezer full for the cold months to come.   Looks like our Lake Erie Fisheries are healthy.  Looking forward to next years Tournament..."
