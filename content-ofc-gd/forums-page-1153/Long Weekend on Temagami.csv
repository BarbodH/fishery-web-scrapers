110166,TJQ,2007-09-04 14:20:00,7806,"Just about every long weekend, I journey up to the north end of Temagami for some time with some really good friends... (they put up with my shinanigans... lol)  We couldn't seem to find the lakers this year but we did manage to find the pickeral, and even a couple of pike, which is odd for the area we were fishing... I didn't do to well.. I spent quite a bit of time ""resting"" in the front of the boat..  The weather was nice and it was gtreat not to spend the weekend working on something...  It sure is beautiful up there....    I love the fish that are smaller than the lures ya catch them on.    AHH!!  Lunch....  of champions... Beans, Eggs, Toast and Pan Fried Pickeral!!    It takes a expert angler to catch small fish!    Contemplating my next move (ie GQ photo shoot...)    Fantastic Rainbow...  The cleaning hut...    A couple of nice ones...    Another one...   Recycling at its finest... ie ""dammit I forgot the funnel.....""     AS always I had a blast... good friends,  good fish... fantastic wings and a couple of really good sleeps!!!!"
