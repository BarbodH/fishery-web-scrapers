In 4hrs, I caught 3 small bass, he caught 23 raging from 1lb to 4.8lb(4lbs 5oz). I think this guy will out do any pro I know. For fishing with Pat again, I will have to say yes, he taught me that if is you don't have a horse shoe up your A**, you won't be a productive fisherperson. Just my rant.  Thanx, Daniel OCH"
109339,Jay T,2007-08-31 16:12:00,282,"He taught you that you have to have hourseshoe up your ... to catch fish. WOW that is great info  . Not to be rude but, I think we all know that you need a little luck on your side to catch fish, and also the proper baits to be used in certain conditions, time of year ect........ Just my rant."
109341,bowshep,2007-08-31 16:16:00,378,"l will take a horse shoe. PLEASE. OH PLEASE, USE A SMALL HORSE!!!!!! LOL. Peace Ken"
109405,danbouck,2007-08-31 20:17:00,4380,Well that explains a lot. I don't bring my horseshoe with me fishing!
110183,bassjnkie,2007-09-04 15:19:00,1101,"I'm going to buy a horse shoe like fishtank's, he's a true ball breaker and bass buster. Fishtank where are you, did that 40# Goby get you. LOL"
110188,Pasquale,2007-09-04 15:25:00,29,"Hey I can't say I have horse shoes. But ontariocarper is right. I""ve had some crazy luck this year.  But trust me there no horse shoes any where."
110252,TJQ,2007-09-04 19:40:00,7806, hahahahahaha... lol.. I know a guy like that too...
110253,.goneFishing.,2007-09-04 19:46:00,10,"What a load of crap. Fishing is all about decent gear, luck and common sense."
110259,Pasquale,2007-09-04 20:18:00,29,"Hey gonefishing. these were just for a laugh. what ontariocarper is saying is that yes you do need lady luck by your side sometimes and yes good gear and know how . But maybe I don't have horse shoes maybe I have a 4 leaf clover, hey maybe even a a rabbits foot. What ever it is lady luck is on my side this year.  Keep fishing! ""fish tank"""
110266,smokinall4s,2007-09-04 21:16:00,89,"I too have a horseshoe, my son. He is always out fishing me."
110267,stuntman,2007-09-04 21:27:00,96,My question are........  1) after it was very clear that fishtank was outfishing you by 7 to1 did you switch to a buzz bait too? 2) how massive is massive?   stuntman
