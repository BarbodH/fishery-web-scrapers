109801,bassboy,2007-09-03 02:32:00,161,"HI Everyone.....  My wife and I were out on Sturgeon today (did not see Cliff on the dock again) and did not really get into much. Some perch, and I missed 2 decent fish....figuring 'eyes by the chunks missing out of my senkos.....  However....at the end of the day, I was pulling in the anchor and lo and behold......Look what I got!!!    Talk about hook line and sinker........somehow it managed to wrap itself, along with a 36 inch leader and about 25 feet of PP around my anchor. So the day was not a total waste, and I can say that I did not get skunked!!! Looks like it has been there a while.......a lot of the varnish/head cement holding the wraps around the bucktail was weathered/gone.  Perhaps Ill be off to the bog in the morning to try it out......   Bill"
109806,mikeymikey,2007-09-03 02:57:00,376,wow... that is one scary looking spinner
109816,jediangler,2007-09-03 03:39:00,1923,"Wow, it's got a trailer hook, on it's trailer hook. I wouldn't want to unhook the musky that inhaled that giant beast."
109832,OhioFisherman,2007-09-03 05:23:00,6623,"LOL, enough lead on that lure to use for an anchor."
109840,muskymatt,2007-09-03 10:27:00,2608,Thats looks like a fudelli spinnerbait....nice spinnerbait.  Dry it out add more head cement and any muskie guy would like to add that to his collection.   Want my mailing address???  M.
109880,bbog,2007-09-03 14:08:00,665,Don't think I have the confidence yet to be meeting the fish that is attracted to that lure!!
109908,joonmoon,2007-09-03 16:01:00,528,"Can you say ""FREEBIE""...gotta luv when ya make an accidental find like that."
109909,Dozer,2007-09-03 16:05:00,896,Hey! Thats my lure!  Just playing.  Now you can tell your wife that you need another fishing trip to test out the lure.
109917,lew,2007-09-03 17:12:00,12767,"I've got a couple of the same lure as that one, one is the same color as yours and the other is chartreuse and orange.  They make an excellent trolling bait and run well at higher speeds."
110005,Pigeontroller,2007-09-03 23:43:00,2793,That would be a 4 or 5 oz Beaver Lures Spinnerbait made by Tony Gallucci of Brampton. An excellent trolling spinnerbait as Lew mentioned!
110010,evster,2007-09-04 00:22:00,367,"Nice catch!  I was out on Lake Erie today dragging tubes for smallies and all I ended up with was a dog leash and a cowboy hat, i'd take your catch over mine any day!"
110012,Crazyhook,2007-09-04 00:37:00,1154,Pigeon troller is correct.. thats a beaver!
110042,bassboy,2007-09-04 01:44:00,161,"Honestly....there is more lead in that thing than my whole spinnerbait box  LOL.  Glad to know I got something decent though....and Pigeon troller got the weight right on. Looked at it tonight and it has 4 oz written on it. I dont even think I have anything that will take it   LOL  Evster.....at least if you get a dog, you will be able to walk it in shade   Thanks for all the info everyone!    Bill"
110124,Seaweed,2007-09-04 12:49:00,135,That is too funny.  It isn't mine... but I have left a few out there over the years.
