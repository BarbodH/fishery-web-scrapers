He had the first fish,good size for him.   After that I caught one about the same. I said five more minutes and we would go when this guy took my worm.   Not as big as yesterday but way more fiesty complete with jumps.I had told the little one he could hold the fish for a picture.As he is bending down the fish jumped one more time smacking him in the leg.He freaked out and started crying,calling the fish bad and mean.I tried not to laugh as I calmed him down.Even after that he wants to try again tomorrow so I hope I have another report for you.Sorry the pics are so dark as I forgot to change settings on the camera."
