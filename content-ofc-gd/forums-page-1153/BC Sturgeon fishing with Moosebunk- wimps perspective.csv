109846,scuro,2007-09-03 11:42:00,386," The story is told from my perspective. The biggest fish were caught in the other boat while we were on the Pitt river which happened on day three. I decided to leave that for the second report. It is told in a chronological manner although not strictly so, that would break up the flow. In the first report I showcased the PB of 3 of the 7 people on the trip. Moosebunk would catch one that was one inch bigger then the Sturgeon displayed in this report. There are easily enough pictures and stories for two reports.  Personally, I wouldn't do another strictly Sturgeon trip again. I'm not exaggerating about the power of these fish. Some people get off on that in a Hemingway manner...others don't. Diane whom you may know as ladyfish refused to fish Sturgeon after day three. She was done like dinner."
109860,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-03 13:34:00,0,"Excellant report, nice fish and great pictures. Sounds like a great experience! I have to agree.... I dont know if Sturgeon is considered sports fishing or work.lol I wonder if Tarpon are harder to bring in!"
109887,Moosebunk,2007-09-03 14:51:00,3970,"Very nice start Chris.  I'm missing the fish and food already.  Bull Trout, not to be confused with Bullheads.  Your sockeye and Bulls were the best catches on the Pitt for sure.  The hotstick man."
