I come from Niagara and really don't want to trailer it every weekend. Does anyone know of any place that rents slips at this time of year? I have tried Picton Harbour Inn - but without any luck. I would like the Picton area - but a short boatride away is ok to?   Anybody got any ideas?  Thanks  Don"
110294,lew,2007-09-04 23:07:00,12767,Maybe try Pickeral Park on the south shore of Hay Bay.  They've got alot of docks and there's probably a few empty ones now that Labor Day has passed and many boaters have taken the boats outta the water.  www.pickerelpark.com

110592,Fang,2007-09-05 20:38:00,1330,Don  I spent over 15 years with a trailer on BOQ and would suggest you find a place that you can store your boat on the trailer and then put it in when needed. Most places have marginal docks and even such the bay can get awful nasty.  Try the marina at Deseronto for storage or any of the campgrounds like Pickeral Park outside of Napanee. From there you're on the right side to launch at Picton Ferry in the morning. Won't have to wait for the ferry to cross from Picton to north shore.
110633,PERCHER,2007-09-05 23:02:00,787,Good point .Leave it on the trailer.You dont want the lower unit to freeze up.You never know when we will get a cold snap.
110644,Dondorfish,2007-09-05 23:49:00,1000,"Thanks for the info guys - and Fang - thats a great idea!  Now I just have to find storage, and that should be a whole lot easier!   Thanks again guys  Don"
