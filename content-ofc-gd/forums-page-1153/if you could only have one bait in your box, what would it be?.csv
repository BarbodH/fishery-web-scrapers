109648,El Daveo,2007-09-02 12:51:00,7," It's a simple, pre-rigged, scented platic worm made by this a little company in Ft. Wayne Indianna. You can get them in a few tackle shops up in Canada (Grimby Tackle for one) but the best colours sell out very quickly. I can't explain why, but this platic worm outperforms any other I have even seen or heard of. It falls better, crwals better, smells better, etc. And although the company promotes them for for bass, I have found that any fish that would ever contemplate biting a real worm will bite this one."
109662,banger,2007-09-02 13:37:00,95,This Kelly baiy sounds pretty good.I might have to pick one of those up.   Spinner bait vs. Jig...    I should have made a poll   
109700,Burning Babies,2007-09-02 17:35:00,150,"Those pier boys are excellent.  I use them mostly for picking bass off specific pieces of cover.  As far as a top bait goes, for all species combined, I would have to go with a jig.  For bass (90% of my fishing), it would be a dead heat between a spinnerbait and a tube jig."
109718,ChrisK,2007-09-02 20:00:00,2772,Not shure if anyone has mentioned this bait yet but if I had to use one bait alone it would have to be the Rapala Rattletrap.  Fish it deep or fish it swallow..In weeds or bump it across rock shoals this bait is pretty tuff. Only problem I find is the finish will come off if too many toothy critters get ahold of it.....  Tight Lines !!!

110122,Seaweed,2007-09-04 12:47:00,135,Good ole  White BigO  Catchs fish like no other bait.
110141,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-09-04 13:16:00,0,"  Before I started fishing muskies only back in '94 I was a firm believer in the white Big O, man did I catch a lot of everything with it. I used to carry a rod in the truck with me and whenever I would pass over water on my way to work I would try and take some time to fish it on my way back home. And when I worked on a near water I would fish at lunch. And naturally if a fish swims in there a minnow would let you know but if you don't have live bait then the white BigO would let you know."

109094,Guest mistyriver1,2007-08-30 19:08:00,0,   Another vote for spinnerbait here....either white or yellow.
109095,mattyk,2007-08-30 19:10:00,2110,i would also have to go with a spinnerbait.
109097,Zib,2007-08-30 19:14:00,369, That is so true. I know a few guys that will put out marker bouys in fishless spots just to get people to fish by them while they're fishing the spot that has the fish.

109107,jedimaster,2007-08-30 19:40:00,3472,I mean I think we have all missed the REAL question here. Why would you need a box if all you had is one bait? Why not just tie it on an leave the box at home?
109130,banger,2007-08-30 20:42:00,95,"    LOL.  good one, oh wise Jedi."

109185,Mike the Pike,2007-08-31 00:36:00,3421,#1 Red Devil  #2 Mepps  I have caught more fish on red devils and mepps than all other Lures.Pike bass and walleye  My newest favorite is the suspending Pink Rapala X-Rap what a freaking lure.Fish magnet.  Rapala husky jerk  Yozuri hydro minnow  Moss Boss  Jitter bug  oh so many I like.I never keep the same lure on for long.  MTP
109189,addict,2007-08-31 00:44:00,475,i want to say spinnerbait but if its only one lure i would say a 3 inch grub works fast and slow and all fish it them.

109260,banger,2007-08-31 07:04:00,95,"Maybe it would have been more fun to pick your top 3.   But as it stands, it's just one.It was a close call for me, between JIG & spinner bait.I've picked up more fish on spinner baits then all other baits.But when it comes to a tuff bite, cold front, heavy heavy cover.It would have to come down to a JIG for me.   I know if your fave fish to fish for is Muskie or Pike.Then maybe a JIG is'nt gonna be your most common bait  to pick.I don't get to fish for skies much anymore.( maybe twice a year, now:)  But for the fishing I do. Bass, Pike, Crappie, Walleyes. Jigs seem to work very well, under all conditions.This makes it my personal #1 pick.   I wish I had made a poll, at the start of this topic.It would have been interesting to see the findings on the Votes.   And when you guys or girls, pick your fave #1 bait to use.Please give a detailed reason why, it's your fave bait to use.I think the reason for the bait, is as important as  the pick itself.   Shawn."
109269,singingdog,2007-08-31 10:07:00,1047,"Bucktail or a rabbit jig: fairly weedless (spoons and bodybaits are for open water), durable, and catches lots of fish.  Spinnerbaits are great when the bite is on, but the fish have to be fairly active for a spinnerbait to work.  Grubs are great but wear out fairly quickly.  If you can't fish a jig from bank, you are confused about how to fish them . You can swim a jig just as well as any other lure.  Pike and Musky? Give me a big bucktail for them anyday."
109362,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-31 17:47:00,0,Jig and Grub or Jig and tubes.
109403,El Daveo,2007-08-31 20:15:00,7,"Kelly's Pier Boy Special - natural.  Everything bites it. Everything stays on. Can use them almost anywhere.  I've caught so many bass on these that it's almost unfair to them. Great for the kids too since little sunfish, bass, and perch around the docks go absolutely nuts for them."
109442,Handlebarz,2007-08-31 22:08:00,3790,"after this last year I would have to say 6 1/4"" woodie it has landed me many musky,Pike I have gotten Bass pickeral and even a Salmon last fall. I know that if the little Fker's that follow it could open there mouth wide enough then I would have pearch and other pan fish on them also. Dogs Balls would be the choice color.   If not a spinner bait not as big as others this way I can catch them smaller fish to use to get the musky if the bite is slow you have to impervise dont jig it just use your pickeral for bait it works trust me I have pics."
109443,andrey7474,2007-08-31 22:12:00,47,  same here
109449,Tacklebuster,2007-08-31 22:31:00,303,"Although its not my goto lure, because I love fishing with spinner baits, but if I was only allowed one lure it would have to be a jig.  Its probably the most diverse lure, can be fished in pretty much any condition, and I don't think there is a fish that won't hit one."
109517,banger,2007-09-01 04:14:00,95,  what is this Kellys peir boy special ???
109530,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-09-01 11:39:00,0,"Did anybody say spinnerbait?  Hands down the number one lure for spring/summer and early fall fishing.  I caught 320 inches of muskies on one yesterday ( well it actually was 3 spinnerbaits ), no monsters but 8 muskies from 36 to 43 inches and 6 of those were all caught casting during one hour around the morning moonset.  It's not only a small fish bait as I've caught a lot of 54 inch fish on them, at least 9 or 10 that I can remember off hand.  I'll also second the floating marker as they work great, but sometimes they are just a 1 fisherman lure though."
109538,The Urban Fisherman,2007-09-01 13:27:00,2050,Silver and Black X-RAP.  sure you might catch more on a jig but it's SOOO boring fishing jigs!   UF
108920,banger,2007-08-30 03:59:00,95,"Well, like the title says. If you had to choose only one lure, out of all the types of lures out there.  What would it be? And why?  For me, it would be a jig!  Because under any fishing condistion,for any kinda fish, it will catch you fish.I love to jig.And have been using jigs for man many years.I find them to work under the tuffest of fish'in days.Tube jigg'in over rocks for Bass is one of my fave ways to fish.And texas rigg'in a 10 "" purple lizard in heavy cover is hard to beat.Or Caralina rigg'in for Walleyes just off bottom can be deadly at times.  You can drag, snap, bounce, hop, wiggle,Drift, swim,or troll a jig.  What more could you ask from a lure.And they are cheap, compaired to hard plastics & other baits.So when you lose them.No big deal, your not out 10 or 20 bucks.  I've also caught some of my biggest fish on a jig.A few years ago, I landed a 20lbs Muskie on a Storm paddle tail jig with 6 pound test.I found when you hook a fish on a jig.The fish has a hard time throwing the hook.They don't have the leverage to throw the bait.Like most hard body baits.And tend to stay in the fishes mouth better, after the big hook set.   Hats off the JIG.  The #1 lure in the World. IMO.    Just my 0.2 worth.   lol"
108924,Sinker,2007-08-30 04:17:00,8692,"For me it would be a 4"" white grub on a 1/4 oz head.   You can catch anything on that.  Sinker"
108925,Anatz,2007-08-30 04:20:00,74,"Shrimp. Smells good to the fishes =], I'm joking.. it would be the Rapala Original Floater F5. Catches most of the different species."
108972,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-30 12:43:00,2585,i would say a jig and grub.  you can catch any type of fish in it.

Not even so much because I manage to catch alot of fish with them, more just because I love fishing with them! Pretty weedless, good castability, fish em shallow or deep, fast or slow and the single big hook makes for easy releases."
109088,Canuck2fan,2007-08-30 18:48:00,1444,"If the intent is to just catch a fish of any kind I would have to say any small spoon is going to give the best bang for the buck. In a boat I would agree with a jig but for fishing under any conditions and to bring fish in a perch paterned 3/8"" spoon would be my choice. I have caught huge pike, salmon, medium perch, catfish, walleye, buckets, smallies and even rock bass on this color of spoon.  If I was in a true survival situation I would be looking around for a way to trap/catch minnows, leechs, worms or crayfish  to use. If I could find ANY of the those live baits I would take the treble hook off the spoon and use it with the live bait because NOTHING works better than live bait in my experience....  After reading this I hope I am NEVER dumb enough to wind up with just one choice in my tackle when I am fishing, because I am the type who takes 2 or 3 rods rigged for different styles of fishing and I generally like to have tons of lures and 2 to 3 types of live bait along when I hit the water."
