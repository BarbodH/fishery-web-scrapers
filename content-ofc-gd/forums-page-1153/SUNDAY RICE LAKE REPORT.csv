110114,DMASSE,2007-09-04 12:09:00,420,"Hello  I havent posted a fishing report in awhile.  Sunday I went fishing with FRANK aka YELLOW14 and one of my other friends Claudio.    We decided to goto Rice Lake out of Whispering Pines resort,  Frank reserved the boat and we arrived there around  9....  By the way what a great deal,  a 16ft tinny with a electric 15hp motor for 10 hrs $70..  Anyway we went out to the northern part first where we caught some bass,  perch, and a few panfish...  I think the finall totals were    FRANK  3 perch 3 Bluegills  all caught on his Mepps Black fury.   Claudio  with 2 good bass on a tourny style spinnerbait,   And  myself 9 Bass with 2 in the 5 pound mark  all on my fav spinnerbait  Here are some pics Claudio with a nice bass http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w12/dma...pg?t=1188907595 http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w12/dma...pg?t=1188907671 http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w12/dma...pg?t=1188907689  All in all an great day on the water with good company  Dave"
110115,ccmtcanada,2007-09-04 12:34:00,7971,Great report and pics!  Wow....$70 for 10 hours is a sweet deal!  Good to see you got out there and did some catching this past weekend!
110120,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-04 12:45:00,698,Nice catch and great price on the boat! At least someone had better luck on Rice than I did.
110151,Golfisher,2007-09-04 13:27:00,586,Some nice bass there.  Any sign of algae boom yet?
110161,Yellow14,2007-09-04 13:57:00,29,"It was a great day on the water. I figure Dmasse would have caught more had we stayed in the weeds in the northern part of Rice lake, as it was we tried a few other spots but no where was as productive as the area just to the weedy area to the north-east of Serpent Mound where we started out."
110163,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-04 14:03:00,0,Nice bass!Did you get them deep or shallow?
110179,DMASSE,2007-09-04 14:45:00,420,"Most of the fish were caught in 5ft or lest, usually under or close to the lilly pads  Dave"
110182,tbayboy,2007-09-04 15:17:00,1497,"Great job guys, nice looking fish there."
110197,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-04 16:16:00,0,Thanks dave. I personally have had limited success this year fishin the pads for some strange reason.
110214,fatherof3,2007-09-04 17:14:00,1769,"some good fish,good job and can't beat the price of the boat"
110268,gone_fishin,2007-09-04 21:32:00,481,"most places on Rice have similar prices... i guess they have to, just because there is so much competition from other rental companies and resorts."
110272,snagmaster,2007-09-04 22:07:00,250,nice fish man ...rice is a tough lake for me...why didnt you post the pics of the 5lbers tho...all i see is two to three lbers...show us the biggins...lol
110292,Smokey,2007-09-04 23:02:00,1278,Nice fish. Congrats and Thanks for the report.
110372,sharper,2007-09-05 03:01:00,279,Nice catches on Rice lake. I didn't have much luck there this summer. Whispering pines is pretty good really close drive distance from T.O as well.
