110304,Roy,2007-09-04 23:37:00,13728,"Gerritt, when I put carpet in my old boat, I looked around at different makes and models of boats to see what they had. I liked the look and feel of the carpet that Princecraft was using in their boats so I bought the quantity I needed directly from them. Same with vinyl or any other flooring. Look aroung to see what you like in the new boats then, approach the manufacturer for the quantity you need. The worst that could happen is that they send you to the boat dealer. I preferred going this route than going to a ""Home depot"" kinda place and getting something that wasn't exactly suited to my needs. The boat dealers usually have quantities of flooring in stock for insurance claims, repairs, touch-ups etc. You'll probably pay more than indoor/outdoor carpeting kind of stuff but it'll be exactly what you want and the dealer/manufacturer will also tell you how to install it and which adhesive products to use.  IMHO...."
110306,Gerritt,2007-09-04 23:40:00,6129,"thanks for that advice Roy. I will swing by Bay City Marine and take a look at their boats as well and see if I am comparing apples to apples.. Good sound advice, I appreciate it!!  Gerritt."
110319,PERCHER,2007-09-05 00:26:00,787,Gerritt Roy is right.Find what you want and be done with it.Marine grade flooring will out last the others and you wont have to do it twice.My Lund classic has a vinyl for thats not slippery when wet and quite durable.
