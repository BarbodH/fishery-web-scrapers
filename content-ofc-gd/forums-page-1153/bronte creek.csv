109551,chewy,2007-09-01 16:12:00,40,this is my personal opinion but i was down fishing the peir last night and desided to have a peek at the creek not to fish and i hope the mnr goes down there and shuts the park down if not there is going to be a lot of fish not even reach there spawning grounds and the god dam snaggers and poachers will have a slaughter house there i havent seen that creek that low in 4 years. lets hope the mnr or somebody does something or were in trouble.
109567,gone_fishin,2007-09-01 20:01:00,481,"i don't think it really matters, Lake Ontario Salmon only have a 2% hatch rate anyways. also, the fish generally come into the rivers after a rain, so the water will be higher and muddier when they enter the river. this year wont be any different than past years."
109568,chewy,2007-09-01 20:26:00,40,it will be different if we dont get any rain there is barly any water past the rebbecca st bridge
109580,xrap,2007-09-01 23:06:00,683,Why don't they make the sanctuary past the rebecca bridge not before it? would make more sense since it's more deeper and harder to snag and doesn't give snaggers a big chance.
109593,addict,2007-09-01 23:51:00,475,"river fishing for chinooks is a waste of time unless your a snagger,or sorry a liner.rarely do those fish bite once in the river try for em at the mouths then let em do thier thing upstream this is my 2 cents"
109594,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-01 23:54:00,2585,fishtat2=  they are hard to catch but they do bite.  I used to catch them when i was a kid without snagging them.  Cheers!
109602,Dozer,2007-09-02 00:27:00,896,Just create a scene and pretend to call MNR.  Perform well!
109609,Canuck2fan,2007-09-02 00:46:00,1444,Due to the low reproduction rates as mentioned above the MNR would smarter to have a rotating shift of CO's just writing fines and seizing equipment for auction. Now if the money from those fines would stay in the MNR coffers for gas and enforcement that would really be something.
109678,xrap,2007-09-02 14:28:00,683,   I like to river fish for nooks and i often bottom bounce but last year i caught 3 nooks drifting. I can't really imagine  the spawn going directly into there mouths and I wasn't even fishing deep. Some people say they don't eat during when thier in the river then how come the best bite is always at night? Last year durignt he day nada. Night time and we had over 25 hookups and 9 landed.
109688,FishFinder,2007-09-02 15:38:00,481,because they have a harder time seeing your line
109696,xrap,2007-09-02 16:40:00,683,"Yea my line. Then why do they choose to still run into the roe bag, or marshmallow or w.e your using."
109702,FishFinder,2007-09-02 18:05:00,481,"try using a bare hook, works just as well"

109708,elusive,2007-09-02 18:41:00,77,bare hook would be illegal then =(
109710,bbnotty,2007-09-02 19:24:00,93,"first , yes they do bite out of anger and instinct and for those that think the rivers are a slaughterhouse you should see whats been going on in the real slaughter house - the lake fishermen kill way more than the river fishers do.  bb"
109723,chewy,2007-09-02 20:21:00,40,who gives a poop it is illegal in the cricks and more should be done to those idiots
109724,danbo,2007-09-02 20:22:00,2646,"Coho & Chinook Salmon were originally stocked back in the '70's to help control the Alewife population in Lake Ontario. The Charter fishery grew as the salmon populations blossomed. The Salmon became a Sport Fishing industry that filled the void of the long gone Lake Trout. River fishing is just a ""bonus"" that the survivor's attempt to reproduce. The USA does the majority of stocking in the big lake. Bottom line is..be grateful we have this fishery and help utilize & protect it. Join a fishing Association to get involved. Legally, all snagged fish must be released. Accidently or not, it happens..."
109807,mikeymikey,2007-09-03 03:10:00,376,"I remember back few years ago when I first started salmon fishing... I really didn't know anything other than casting lures from the pier. But what I also did from bronte creek was use a original floating raps F07.  In one of those pools where salmons were in... all i did was let the rapala flow with the river and when i got near those pool, i just stop and let the lure swim with the current on a spot and salmon would most of times swim up and bite the lure. And due to slower river current lure doesn't dive much,,, so you'll see salmon head coming out the water."

110211,Mmagic76,2007-09-04 16:53:00,7,"LOL, that was hilarious!"
110222,addict,2007-09-04 18:00:00,475,"i will agree salmon bite out of anger while upstream u would to if u seen the same ugly fly or roe bag drift by your face a million times.as for hooking them bottom bouncing they bassicaly swim into your line mouths gaping and gasping the line slides down to the hook and hey it looks like it ate it,ever notice alot of the time the hook is just on the outside of the mouth.as for bottom bouncing working better at night this is because the fish move under the cover of darkness.if u do fish like this dont waste your time with roe use ear plugs or marshmellows or a piece of foam ive even used a cigarette butt with success."
