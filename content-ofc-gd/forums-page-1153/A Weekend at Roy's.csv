110041,Joey,2007-09-04 01:41:00,9122,"We headed out to Roy and J's house Friday after work at about 5 p.m.  We knew we had a long trip so we loaded  up the truck with pop and chips and nibs and headed east .   Traffic was pretty crappy for the first couple of hours from volume and construction but wasn't at a stand still too many times.  Snapped the big apple on the way.    We arrived around midnight and da boys stayed up til 4 a.m.  That' didn't stop them from getting up at a half decent hour for coffee and we caught up on life and Roy showed off his homemade baits    After coffee and a wonderful breakfast made by J, we hit the Larry.          We weren't out long when Paul yells ""Fish On"" and Roy grabbed the net.  Now we left the house with full intentions of catching musky and maybe a few Pickerel, so the only net we brought was the BIG one, so try not to laugh at the net job          It wasn't the musky or species we wanted, but hey, it was a fish  That was it for fish for the day, not including watching the sturgeon do their acrobatics in the water, and one just about into the boat that made Paul almost scream like a girl, or should I say scream like TJ  J had supper prepped when we got back and some company was there, Joanna and Jean-Paul, whom we had met before, and we had a wonderful supper and great conversation.    We headed out again Sunday morning and mostly did some sight seeing and exploring new waters.  Found some neat spots and some not so neat spots, one only 6 inches deep that almost swamped us, and a few unfortunate rock dings, but we had fun and shot the bull, and made fun of boaters who came too close when they had hundreds of yards on either side of us to zoom past, but chose to come within a few feet of us  I took some pics of the many sights that I thought were neat.      The sundial at Roy's club.    Some flowers in J's garden.      We had another wonderful supper Sunday night and then we gave Roy a tutorial of Nascar Nextel Cup and made him pick a driver so the race would be more exciting for him.  He chose Martin Truex and we enjoyed the race, although it did end a little late.  I think we've converted him to a Nascar fan  I think Paul is making fun of Truex in this next pic, or it could be the happy juice, I don't know    But once again it was a fabulous time and I really want to thank you Roy and J for having us, it was a pleasure and also thank Helene for letting us use her bedroom.  The three of you are awesome     You don't cook too bad either  Cheers,  Joey"

Too bad I missed you guys but I was camping in Ontario.  Glad you enjoyed our Belle province and the great time at Roy's.   Mike
