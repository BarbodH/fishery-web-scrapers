It was not really fighting until it swam towards my pkie spot.the line starts peeling out and I watched the carp swim by with a pike right behind it!Couldn't believe it.The pike chased it around until I got the carp on shore.Here are a couple pics.   Hate how I look in the 2nd one.After letting the carp go I figured I would try again.The line starts moving again but this time it is a small bass.Again the pike comes out and follows it around.Of course when I decide to try for the pike again it has no interest.Have to get some live bait.Anyway,still don't have my pike(really getting on my nerves) but did catch a fun fish."

110039,MJL,2007-09-04 01:39:00,2427,It looks like a species of redhorse to me.  Great write-up
110051,fatherof3,2007-09-04 01:55:00,1769,"MJL,you might be right after looking up red horse.My bad."

110058,tbayboy,2007-09-04 02:05:00,1497,"Those pike are going to torment you til the end of your days.  I love the ongoing soap opera of you vs them though, I'm sure there'll be a big season finally when you finally get them"
110064,Mike Pike,2007-09-04 02:28:00,1332,Carp or sucker.. they're both ugly!  lol  Hope you got a little fight out of it anyway.  And good luck on your quest to conquer those pike.  Cheers!
110065,Greencoachdog,2007-09-04 02:28:00,8163,That is a World Class Red Horse Sucker!!!
110083,Beats,2007-09-04 03:26:00,543,"the first pic definately looks like a sucker.  the colouration and size of scales in the 2nd pic make it look carp-like, but its a really big sucker"
110126,ccmtcanada,2007-09-04 12:55:00,7971,"Great report!  You got into some fish, so at least that was exciting.  As for those pike, they'll continue to taunt you...dont give up.  I find that by telling them (yes, shout it out), that you'll promise to release them, the nice ones will take your lure.  Give that a try next time, and if you get a few strange looks from people, just start screaming and hitting yourself...they'll likely just leave you alone."
110155,The Urban Fisherman,2007-09-04 13:36:00,2050,"holy crap that's a huge redhorse!  I used to fish them in the Thames in the spring, when they come in thick it's non-stop action.  Good job dude!  Cheers, UF"
