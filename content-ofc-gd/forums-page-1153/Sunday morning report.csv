Skip had never fished before, so Saturday, took him to CTC to get a license and we were ready. Sunday morning was a bit chilly, but calm, we are good to go! Launched out of New Castle and headed for 300+ ft of water. After the 14 mile run out, rods in the water by 7:30am. Running two riggers, two dipsey's and one lead core, 10 colours out off an in-line board. Since SKip had never caught a fish before, he got to be the first up. 1/2 hour in, rigger goes off with a 6 lb steelie going ape poop! Skip had a ball! Next fish was a 11 lb Kohoe, really fat little football... caught on the lead core and it was my turn up. Silly thing fought hard at first, then starting running at the boat, from 300ft out! Man, talk about alot of reeling, my arm was aching by the time it saw the boat and made a U turn away! Stayed out until 12:00pm, with our total going 6 for 11(one salmon, the rest Steelies). Most fish lost we on no-stretch (Dipsey's), with one ""self release""boat side and a 10lb plus fish. I have some pics, but lack the ability to post them. (computer dumbLOL) I believe that Skip would be pleased as all you know what, to do it again! Conditions on Sunday were great, slight chop and warming as the day went on! Question for you Trout guys... the Steelies and Kohoe I filleted, had eggs in them. Should I have saved them for some later season shore fishing? Are they too early at this time to be useful? They seemed small to me, but then again, I'm not really a trout dude so... any thoughts for next time? HH"

As the season progresses the eggs will really increase in size (think about 3 to 4 times what you saw) and won't be as tightly packed in the membrane.  At this time they can be scraped out or left attached to the membrane and can be used for bait.  I actually prefer using skein or eggs scraped from the skein as opposed to loose eggs that fall out of a fish.  My theory is that it contains much more scent and the eggs are softer.  You could have certainly kept the eggs for bait though, good to know for next time.  Tony"
