109810,Blake,2007-09-03 03:21:00,418,Well went out on Erie for some smallmouth action this afternoon and this great fishery produced.  Weather was beauty with clear skies and just a little breeze on the lake.  We fished numerous areas from shallow rock edges from shallow breaks and some deeper rock piles.  The fishing was on in almost all areas.  The best techniques were jerkbaits from Jackall and Lucky Craft.  Phenix tubes 3 1/2 inch with 1/8oz tube jigs were the ticket with also drop shotting Phenix drop shot worms and also Berkley Gulp minnows.  We caught over 30 fish and had a great afternoon.  Here are a couple of pics of some of the bigger ones caught:    This one was 5 lbs 11 oz on the scale
