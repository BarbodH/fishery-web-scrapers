There must be 25 people running in circles here today and we have yet another day of this stuff Thursday. Apparently at least some of the ""actors"" are famous as they were attached by fans out on Yonge Street during a break. I managed to watch a couple of takes today... man, I haven't seen that much cheese since my last visit to Kennsington Market! HH"

There was one in a bookstore by my office at Yonge & Eglinton (South west side...it's not there anymore...I think it was called Edwards).  They had those ""train tracks"" set up outside the store on the sidewalk for the cameras.  People were everywhere trying to catch a glimpse of Kelly Preston or Kelly McGillis (always got those two mixed up)."
