351711,mpagnan,2009-06-13 20:18:00,84,"I was wondering if anyone who's fished Whiteman's can offer me some advice on where to go?  Now, I'm not looking for your hot-spot but just general locations (where roads meet the creek) because I'm heading out tomorrow morning and I don't have much time at all to scout and then fish.  Thanks, MJP  P.S. If anyone wants to go PM me."
351729,laszlo,2009-06-13 22:12:00,487,there are special regulations on whiteman's so read up in your reg. book. or online. i've fished the creek as a kid for many years back in the early 90's. it's not nearly as good as it once was. over fishing and everyone keeping their limit (back then i think it was 8).  i would suggest getting out as early as possible to increase your chances and don't keep any you catch out of respect for the locals. the great thing about it though is the scenery.  take hwy 53 and just before you get into burford from brantford turn north on one of the sideroads.  that's all i'll say for now. the rest you'll have to figure out yourself.  good luck
351733,purekgw,2009-06-13 22:54:00,585,awesome creek single barbless hook and no live bait if i remember right any spot is good just find deep holes
351735,mpagnan,2009-06-13 23:07:00,84,I saw some of the creek today and there are many deep pools out there.  I just don't know what to go with?  All spinners or try some flys with a float bubble.

351765,JohnF,2009-06-14 01:35:00,3494, Is electrofishing done with a spinning rig or a baitcaster?  JF
351766,Musky or Specks,2009-06-14 01:36:00,2710,A magic wand
351768,JohnF,2009-06-14 01:38:00,3494,Ahhh! I've been hoping the good fish fairy will leave me one of them in my stocking. There are days when you just can't buy a fish. Mebbe that wand thingy will make all my fishing dreams come true.  JF  JF
351770,purekgw,2009-06-14 01:41:00,585,"TNT does the same thing but leave nothin alive, your choice"
351772,JohnF,2009-06-14 01:42:00,3494, I like to be alive after the fact. YMMV  JF
351774,n8tivebigguy,2009-06-14 01:54:00,30,I know i'm a burnt cookie for asking but is there only trout that inhabit whiteman's creek? It's a noob question. lol
351775,Musky or Specks,2009-06-14 01:58:00,2710,They are the apex predator for most of the creek but there are some pike and smallmouth around.
351827,laszlo,2009-06-14 10:27:00,487,i've caught:  rainbow brown chub sucker
351898,mpagnan,2009-06-14 14:28:00,84,Yesterday I caught 3 small Bows and what appeared to be a pretty rough around the edges Steel.
357585,bennetkd,2009-07-01 22:11:00,1,Is any of Whiteman's on private property?  I've been hesitant to fish other than in Apps Mill because I'm not sure if I'd be trespassing.  Am I okay as long as I stay in the water?  Thanks!
357621,danbouck,2009-07-02 00:03:00,4380,Most of it is private. Some owners have dropped trees so you can't get downstream.
357684,Wendel,2009-07-02 03:05:00,213,"I've always found blue fox spinners to work well there. I also did fairly well with single eggs...  It's been about 6 years since I fished it, I used to fish mainly between cleaver and mill street, sometimes I'd head up the between mill and bishopgate, but always did better the other way..."
