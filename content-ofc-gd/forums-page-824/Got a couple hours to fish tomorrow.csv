I live in Milton, and the wife says I can go at 6 (speaking of which, I gotta say I am pretty lucky to have a wife that encourages me to fish 3-4 times a week, even if only for 2-3 hours at a time even though we have a 2 year old and a 2 month old baby at home) so I want to stick to 30 minutes or so of driving max.  If anyone wants to meet up tomorrow evening for some river walking and show me all your honey holes, I would be willing to accept that too!!  Cheers"

I just want to land some fish! My dilemma is always that I get stuck in a rut because with only a short few hours to fish, I want to go where I know there is a chance of catching something, as opposed to experimenting and trying new spots. Although I know that I have to try new things to find good spots, so its a catch 22 I guess."
