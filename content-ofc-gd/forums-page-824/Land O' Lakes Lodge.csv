It says they have serviced sites, and a playground for the kids. Their website isn't really that helpful, any info would be fantastic."
358052,Mike01,2009-07-03 02:11:00,378,somebody has to know something about this place....what about you Temagami folk??
358153,Ksword,2009-07-03 12:29:00,40,"Hi Mike - I have never stayed there, but I have driven thru it..  We camp at Marten River PP (which is right across the river) every year - it is a great park...  To me, it seemed like the camping area at Land O Lakes was mostly seasonal campers who leave their campers there all year.."
358166,Mike01,2009-07-03 13:08:00,378,Did you see any kind of playground??
358284,Ksword,2009-07-03 20:09:00,40,"Yeah - If I recall,there was a pretty big multi-coloured playground by the beach..?"
