357898,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-02 19:47:00,10439, These work just as well to keep you cool on a hot summers day. But I would replace the Mountain Dew with something a litte better. 
357899,NAW,2009-07-02 19:53:00,4022,Not a post that I expected to see on Canada day.  The one day in the year that raging patriots can go wild with their attire.  I think it's a good thing. It would be a little weird if it were like that every day of the year.  I expect and welcome it on Canada day though.

You cannot change my mind. You can  convince me to change my opinion based on new information. But you haven't given me any. Yes it is the mods' call to lock a thread but so far, there is no reason to. And the learning curve? You've been here 6 months under that user name. I consider you an intelligent individual and reckon that 6 months is plenty to learn the rules. Pay special attention to the part about 'baiting'.  All is good here so far."
358005,Fishnwire,2009-07-03 00:21:00,983,"As little as 20 years ago, you'd have a hard time finding pictures of a lot of people decked out in that way.  We as a nation had a real identity crisis for a long time.  The fact that more and more Canadians are moved to show their ""patriotism"" in a way that possibly borders on tacky is a good thing.  I say ""ROCK ON!"" to whoever wanys to show their national pride in whatever way they see fit.     BTW - Wearing an ACTUAL flag, not a representation of one, might be considered disrespectful.  Somebody drying themselves at the beach with a towel that looks like a flag and using an actual flag are two different things...that said, a door mat that looks like a Canadian flag would be unacceptable.  I think the distinction is usually pretty obvious."

358085,bigugli,2009-07-03 03:20:00,6138,"To quote an old sweat ( veteran of WW I ) I once knew. ""The flag is no more than a rag on a pole. Shot through, soiled, worn and bloodied.   But men have fought and died for that flag and all it represents, and to this day, dutifully offer there loyalty to all that it represents ( whether the Maple Leaf or the Ensign).""  It may be only a rag on a pole, but it is mine to hold and cherish. Mine to uphold and respect. Today, we are still fortunate to have men and women in this country who would give up there lives for it. Who cares how we display or wear it as long as we hold it dear."

358116,Jonny,2009-07-03 06:21:00,1380," Don't go assuming too much by the start date. I only started regularly reading and posting in this forum a few weeks ago. I had a total of six posts from my join date til June 1st, and rarely visited the site.  There seems to be enough leeway in the rules, judging by what I've seen here on EI, Welfare, the GM bailout, trashing unions, etc.  The difference between principle and practice.   NP, then. I imagine your skin is as thick as mine. I don't mind people holding a different opinion from my own. And I don't expect every person to be a friend, or friendly, just as I wouldn't expect it in real life."
357781,Jonny,2009-07-02 14:51:00,1380,"We see pictures like the ones below all over the news.  Why do people have to dress so goofy for Canada Day? It makes us look like a bunch of clowns. And it reduces the status of the Maple Leaf to that of a logo for a hockey or baseball team.  Want to celebrate Canada Day? Fly a flag on your boat, your vehicle, on a stick, whatever. By all means, join in the festivities but do so with some taste.  "
357784,Raf,2009-07-02 14:55:00,3495,how utterly un-canadian of you  The True North strong and free!
357786,wallyboss,2009-07-02 14:58:00,1095,Check the news on July 4th and you will see a lot of Americans doing the same thing as those people.  What they are doing is nothing else but being Patriotic. They don't want to carry the flag around all day so they wear it.
357788,Cast-Away,2009-07-02 15:01:00,790,"I have to disagree with you here. Canada Day is a celebration of our great nation and the freedom that we enjoy and are privilaged to have. If anything I don't think that Canadians are patriotic enough. If you drive through any community in the United States, you see the American flag flying on at least one in five homes. It would be nice to see more of that here.  The pictures that you posted are a great encouragement to the younger generation of Canadians like the kids shown, to celebrate our great country! Stand up and be proud. Don't roll over and be another one of those complacant Canucks."
357792,Rattletrap2,2009-07-02 15:18:00,1652,"hmmm.... I would have to disagree with you on this one Jocko!  I think we need a whole lot more Canadian patriotism....in whatever form we can get it. Those folks are just having some fun celebrating the great country we call home! What harm is there in that? At my home, we fly the flag all year round and really go all out for Canada Day!  If I was an American, I would be more than proud to fly the Stars and Stripes as well. They are both great nations that we are proud of. I'm sure our friends south of the border will be doing just that in a couple of days!"
357797,POLLIWOGG,2009-07-02 15:36:00,835,"So we got some of people that know what color the flag is, its a long way from understanding how we elect a government but its a start.  I would imagine somewhere in flag rules its a no no but a little civil disobedience is a good thing."
357798,markiemark70,2009-07-02 15:37:00,158,Put me down for respectful disagreement as well. I like to see this kind of celebration of our great country!!

357800,tipupesox,2009-07-02 15:39:00,167,"Being from the states I don't under your beef about people wearing patriotic items or clothing.  I myself will be wearing a US Flag proudly on my shirt and will have several flags out around my home.  My father-in-law was a pretty close look alike to the Uncle Sam character in American History.  He would proudly march in the 4th of July parade for the town.  He passed a few years ago and I can still remember him telling me every year, this is a great country we live in.  Be happy that you have the choices and freedoms of a free society.  Tom"

357815,JohnF,2009-07-02 16:42:00,3494," I think we agree on this one. I'm all for celebrating our great country, but doesn't our flag, as one of, if not the greatest symbol we have, deserve to be treated with a modicum of respect. We deplore folks who deface our flag in any way, and it just seems that this is the thin end of the wedge when it comes to disrespecting the flag as a symbol.  It's fairly obvious none of these folks mean any disrespect but given the breakdown of so many of our old traditions of showing respect I'd like to see at least a few of them saved. I wonder how those same folks would react if the Queen or the Governor General appeared in public in a clown hat with the Canadian flag as decoration? I'm sure there'd be some indignation expressed.  All that being said I have a Bass Pro teeshirt with the Maple Leaf on it. Mea culpa?  JF"
357817,douG,2009-07-02 16:57:00,2693,"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  I'm just sayin'."
357838,JohnF,2009-07-02 17:34:00,3494," Here's something I found on the Canadian flag specifically. Admittedly nowhere does it say in so many words that it should not be used for silly hats etc, but the intent is clear.  JF"

For the record....i dont fly a flag on my lawn or own any canadian flag clothing....i rely on the people of ""over the top"" to pull my weight for me Does this make me unpatriotic??? i think not.. my heart is as warm as theirs ...but the decision is mine to make because of the flag they wear  I suppose you dont own any hockey jerseys or go to any games either ( especially away games)  just my 02 cents"
357857,blaque,2009-07-02 18:14:00,2419,Everybodies intent is good here..........i personally dont see an issue with these specific images at all. Thats my opinion..........
357862,Jonny,2009-07-02 18:26:00,1380,"I expected that my post would get some negative response. I stated it more negatively than I feel; at least people are showing their pride, though IMO in sometimes odd ways.  Please don't jump to the conclusion that I'm unpatriotic because I question how the flag is used. I'm as proud as the next Canadian of that flag. I was around when it was first adopted and even drew a picture in grade school of what I thought the new flag should look like (that was a big thing for kids to do at that time). I also remember that it seemed most people thought the new flag would never catch on. Well, it sure has --- a classy emblem for a classy country.  ""Am I even Canadian?""  ""Am I narrow-minded?""  I liked the responses better that just disagreed."

In fact, I am slightly offended when I see our flag all torn and faded waving in front of a home or business. I believe that the intent of the law in the US was to prevent the actual flag from being disrespected.  As already mentioned, those kids do not seem to be disrespecting anything at all. Jocko, I would imagine that you are very patriotic indeed. I also respect your opinion on the clothing items.  Wishing all in the US a very happy Independence day on Saturday!"
