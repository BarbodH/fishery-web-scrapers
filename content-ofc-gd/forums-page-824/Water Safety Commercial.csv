357525,Jer,2009-07-01 18:56:00,1426,What part of staying away from a hydro dam did you not understand?
357528,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-01 19:05:00,0,  hahahahahahahaha  i think you gotta watch it again dara...hehehe
357538,Dara,2009-07-01 19:34:00,3052,"That would generally be the power dam owners running an ad like that.  but hey, we gave em away, so our tax dollars may as well go for this too"
357548,Jer,2009-07-01 20:24:00,1426,"""This message is brought to you by the Ontario Provincial Police & Ontario Power Generation""  Sounds like a partnership, and besides, it's the OPP that will be giving you the fine."
357552,Dara,2009-07-01 20:43:00,3052,  Public service ads eh  I guess they have the statistics and know where the safety money should be spent

357567,danbouck,2009-07-01 21:31:00,4380,  Is it just me or does it sound like Mike Rowe in that
357578,Jer,2009-07-01 21:56:00,1426,"  I recently saw his show working on an Alaskan fishing trawler...I wonder if he wished he had his ""wonder boner""."
357787,Rattletrap2,2009-07-02 14:58:00,1652,"The OPP cop reminds me of Bill Murray in Caddy Shack!!! and......it's good to hear Steve Smith (Red Green) getting some work in his retirement as ""the fish""!!!"
357822,douG,2009-07-02 17:01:00,2693,"I was thinking the same thing, Rattletrap.  Red Green lives."
357823,Governator,2009-07-02 17:01:00,879,"  lol, cracks me up everytime"
357829,JayZ,2009-07-02 17:17:00,18,"  legally, you don't have to wear a life jacket in a seadoo boat.  you don't have to wear one on a pwc either if you have the proper equipment on board.  not a smart idea, but that is the way the law is written."
357972,Jer,2009-07-02 22:52:00,1426,"You also don't need paddles if you have an anchor...and vice versa.  I've never understood that.  I had an OPP safety check once, and the officer saw my anchor with an indiscriminant amount of rope (probably not enough, it's pretty shallow around here) and said ""Oh, I see you have an anchor so you don't need any paddles"". I had paddles in a side compartment but he didn't want to see them.  Seems to me, one is for moving and the other is for staying put. How are they interchangable?"
