I'm not sure of the year but its pretty old, probably from the '70s.  I have access to the boat this weekend but need to fill it with oil. I did it several years ago but can't remember exactly what oil to use. I do remember it being blue and the container resembling the narrow cylinder bottle of gear oil.  If anyone is familiar with this older motor and can help identify what oil I need to fill it up with, that would be awesome.   Thanks in advance,  -j"
