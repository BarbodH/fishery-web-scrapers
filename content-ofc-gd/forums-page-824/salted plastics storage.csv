358276,NAC,2009-07-03 19:44:00,369,Can different coloured tubes be stored in the same pkg without the colours running?  or is it dependant on what colours? Thanks.
358281,timmeh,2009-07-03 20:06:00,609,If they are wet at all there's a good chance the colors will run (ie gulp). I've kept dry ones together without any problems but only for short period of time.  Though sometimes you create really interesting color patterns when plastics run together.
358288,JohnF,2009-07-03 20:34:00,3494,Some dry plastics run. I have some multi-coloured tubes to prove it.  JF

358308,JohnF,2009-07-03 22:15:00,3494, Fer sure I didn't throw 'em away. One never knows when one might happen upon the next greatest lure. I'll be throwing some very odd coloured plastic this summer.  JF
