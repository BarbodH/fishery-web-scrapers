358196,capt_hooked,2009-07-03 14:31:00,212,I am thinking I would like to post a new page in Lakair's new photo gallery dedicated to the OFC G2Gs.  If you could please send me a few of your best photos and I would be most grateful and  happy to post some of the them on this new page.  Perhaps we could make a contest out of this...  with a prize going to the best photo...?!  Please send photos to: [emailÂ protected]  Try to keep the file size small  if you can?   I would also like to take this opportunity to say how much Leslie and I enjoyed having everyone up here again this year... amazing.. 8 years already..!  How did that happen...?   Thanks.... to all.........   the cap't (and his much better half).....

I do look pretty good for 90 .. don't I...?   Hey.. the other day... some old customer.. was celebrating his birthday..
