They were calling for pretty crappy weather for us but i think we got extremely lucky. We stayed at my uncles place in scarborough, and fished july 1st in the evening and july 2nd in the morning. We managed to get three rainbows and one salmon at the 15lb mark. It was a good go and we hope to get down once more hopefully in august. Heres a few pics from the action.    "

358064,tambo,2009-07-03 02:37:00,85,"I'm just playing, I'm sure you were playing it safe  I've heard of a lot of guys giving up on gb and huron.  Owen sound harbour is a ghost town.  My dad and i have fished the notty religiously for decades, and even tqhe bow run is getting later and later.  I didn't even bother fishing last year........spend time hunting partridge instead.  From what i've hear, the demise is baitfish related........alewifes disappeard. tambo"
