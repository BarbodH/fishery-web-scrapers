I have no complaints as these lures were fished and hit hard, mostly pike and muskie.   It was suggested that I seal new ones before fishing with them if I want them to last a bit longer.  Great idea but I haven't a clue how to do this.   Suggestions??   Thanks!"
358104,jace,2009-07-03 04:42:00,472,"they probably meant a tough urethane or epoxy clearcoat.   choose one from a real auto paint shop, not ctc and walmart."
358115,Guest skeeter99,2009-07-03 06:04:00,0,  easy to make your lures more durable  get 2 part clear epoxy from ctc or walmart mix together and to make it more thin(brushable) put a drop or 2 of varsol/thinner mix well  brush on lures and let dry  (24 hour is better than the quick setting stuff)  that coating will be hard as rock  repeat 2 or three times  automotive clearcoats chip very easily  when used on fishing lures trust me !! been down that road
358122,outllaw,2009-07-03 10:12:00,1232,the problem will be. the husky jerks will be to heavy. they are not designed for heavier top coats.. if you must try circa new lustre 55. mix exact.
