357124,NAW,2009-06-30 14:48:00,4022,"Wow,  The guy holding that wolf if really small eh!  Like wallybass said, the wolf is big, but not freakishly big."
357125,oxcowboy,2009-06-30 14:51:00,544,very true rick especially for sheep and goats.  i have my pup on order currently for our coyote problem.  not sure how they would work for a pack of wolves.  jason
357129,Jer,2009-06-30 14:57:00,1426,"I've got a similar pic...     ...key differences:  the dog weighs about 100 lbs I weigh about 190 lbs, 5' 10"" the dog is still alive"
357131,bigfish1965,2009-06-30 14:58:00,3382,"My parents breed Pyrenees just for that problem, Jason. Most go to Colorado and Minnesota. They do quite well against wolves and none have been taken down by a wolf yet. They are quite a bit smarter than the wolves and make the target too much of a risk. Wolves are smart enough not to risk a dangerous take down. They need each member of the pack healthy. Without a full healthy pack their hunting ability is greatly diminished."
357132,MillerPhoto,2009-06-30 15:00:00,147,Even passed a wolf joggin down the side of the 401 around Grafton on Sunday at 6:15am   He was about the size of large German Sheppard.  They are gradually making their way into residential areas..   Well I suppose technically Residential areas are moving into their territory.. But eaither way.. Even a friend was out on a quad last week up in Castleton area and seen a Black Bear.
357133,cambo,2009-06-30 15:00:00,62," True, our biggest problem was the racoons. They would devestate our corn, little buggers would push down the stocks and take one bite out of the cob. Even with hunting them with our coon dog we eventually gave up the battle and stopped growing corn, poor cows. Stuck to growing grain after that but still had to hunt them to keep them out of there"
357163,BillM,2009-06-30 16:09:00,17367,"80kg's is 176lbs..  I don't think we have many, if any at all 176lb wolves walking around Ontario"
357182,archie_james_c,2009-06-30 17:07:00,618,  What I meant was MOOSE Calves...and yes they do. More people in Ontario need to get into predator hunting to thin there numbers out a bit.
357185,archie_james_c,2009-06-30 17:10:00,618,  It was killed in Alberta. There is a big write up on it on canadiangunnutz.com and huntingbc.ca. Apparently one of the board members actually saw the hunter and the wolf in transit going home from the hunt.
357206,Chris,2009-06-30 18:31:00,405," Maybe they are rare in the more populated places, but out here in rural Ontario the MNR have actually put bounties on wolves for that exact reason. I can remember one year some local hunters took 10 wolves out of the bush near my parents farm and were paid for doing it."
357211,BillM,2009-06-30 18:39:00,17367,"  There are news articles that prove otherwise.  No way that wolf was shot in Canada, or North America for that matter."
357215,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-30 18:48:00,835,"My bud was duck hunting south of Fort McMurry and just about stepped on one. It was a hot sunny day and it was sound asleep, they both must have jumped 10 feet.  I put up an electric fence to keep the coons out of the corn but this year I'm hoping the coyotes have got them all. Last year you could see the tracks between corn rows where they were hunting coons and skunks but the coyotes ate off one batch of corn they took a liking to.  A few years back we had an old Siberian husky living in the corn fields, no coons that year."
357270,johnnyb,2009-06-30 21:33:00,3413,"Well the guy that sent it to me was of course,  one of many in a chain of ""FWD""s..but the note attached said it was taken in Edson, Alberta, over a bear bait.  He is also the same guy that sent me a pic of Ewout Bloum's ""massive canadian record pike"" we are all so familiar with...like I say...I just thought it was a cool pic."

358097,Twocoda,2009-07-03 04:09:00,4130,I guess we will have to wait for the video to come out...im sure there will be complete details in the interviews  the second photo with the shooter puts a better perspective on the animals size....still an incredible beast but not that uncommon in Alberta  Congratulations to them...they got what they were after....sales of their scent bait shall increase
358108,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-03 05:17:00,10439,  I have seen a number of very large wolves as well. The last really big one I saw was in the winter of '07 and it was the size of a Great Dane.

357043,Cudz,2009-06-30 04:22:00,2652,Pretty sure that is the proper hold for an 8ft long wolf.

357049,Cudz,2009-06-30 05:22:00,2652,Are you kidding me?  I am pretty sure when that woodcutter opens up that wolf he will find Little Red Riding hood and her grandma inside and the wolf wasn't even full yet.  That is a fact!
357053,archie_james_c,2009-06-30 06:42:00,618, No.      One reason Alabama man...  CALF KILLERS.
357057,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-30 10:19:00,2038,  That's just an old Myth.....
357073,cambo,2009-06-30 12:08:00,62," No myth, predators do take live stock, i personally know farms that have lost  sheep and the odd calf to bears and wolves. People in the city want you to believe that these animals prance around the bush eating berries what a bunch of crock. Why is it a waste he more than likely took a really nice pelt off this animal and who is to say he didn't use the meat. I really don't understand when fisherman bash hunting, your doing the same but instead of animals with fish. If someone was holding a trophy fish I wouldn't bash him on it. I would say wow nice catch good for you. Oh by the way, nice wolf"
357084,blaque,2009-06-30 12:56:00,2419," Ive heard of catch and release........im not so sure shoot in the face and release is as successful. I would guess that if he tried to release that wolf, iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit proooooooobably aint going anywhere.  Cant you hunters just use tranquilizers, get your pic, and hang it on the fridge?"
357094,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-30 13:22:00,2038,"  I also enjoy hunting , But i don't believe in lets say taking down a Bald eagle cause it swooped a chicken or so.."
357096,BITEME,2009-06-30 13:24:00,1968," Not wolves but just ask some of the farmers in Milton how much livestock they lose to coyote""s. I would'nt dart a wolf unless I was in peril but coyotes are fair game and good hunting practice. Peter"
357102,Handlebarz,2009-06-30 13:49:00,3790,I have never owned a gun bigger then my pellet guy and dont hunt at all (well musky hunting) I say that is one huge wolf and I dont think its wrong to share the pic like was said he could have used the meat or skin even if it was for the wall.  When I lived in Sudbury we had alot of problems with Brush wolf's they would send the female into your back yard and lure out your dog then have the pack jump on them we chased one away from a friends house across lake Ramsey (winter time) it ran to bald rock and up the rock and stood there we could see others in the trees it was kinda freaky there was alot of small pets missing usually they would just find the ball of fur from where it was ripped from the leash it was on.  If the wolf or other animal is in season then go for it.
357103,wallyboss,2009-06-30 13:52:00,1095,"First of all the guy holding the wolf is 5'1"" and weighs 120lbs.  Most adult timber wolves would be that big."
357106,cambo,2009-06-30 14:03:00,62," I got it I'll stick a sharp hook through a corn cob,wait for the deer to take it. I will then set the hook through the deers mouth and upper jaw. Then I will reel it in with the attached rope,once close I will net it,then take out the hook and release. lol   i don't think it is quite practical when dealing with animals"
357109,bigfish1965,2009-06-30 14:18:00,3382,"Well I'm not much for the killing of top predators like musky or wolves, but if it is in season it is their right. It certainly is not a Canadian wolf..they don't get anywhere near that size. That things looks to weigh about 120 to 140 pounds. We have programs to compensate farmers for livestock lost to wolves. Used to to inspections for the MNR on wolf kills..very few, mostly young sheep and at the time the farmer got more for the compensation than he would have got at market....yet some of them still wanted the wolf shot... I think others left the lambs out on purpose. Coyote kills are more common and leave a much bigger mess behind...but by and large predator attacks on livestock are extremely rare. Animals like deer, birds, mice and gophers do much more damage to farmers pockets than the canines ever could."
357114,troutologist,2009-06-30 14:26:00,951,"Rick,  I have seen quite a few wolves that would be in the 100-150lb range. I understand the tendancy to exaggerate the size, but just this spring myself and 2 others saw 2 wolves that size. We took quite a while to come up with an estimate on the size and weight, comparing it to a moose carcass they were feeding on. These wolves were not far off of a deeri n height and mass. However the pictured animal looks much fatter than many I have seen.  I suspect though it is a very large wolf in the picture, the gent holding it, as stated is not an O lineman in the NFL"
357116,oxcowboy,2009-06-30 14:30:00,544,"i assume that this wolf was taken legally, therefore i have no problem with it.  as far as the livestock predation, yes it is a fact that these animals will take a calf from a farm.  to most of you that may not seem like too big of a deal, however if someone was to come and steal your paycheck once or twice a year im sure you wouldnt be to happy!     to the farmer, that is exactly what that calf represents without it to sell in the fall or spring they may not be able to pay their bills or farm payments just like you may not be able to pay your electric bill or car payment.  jason"
