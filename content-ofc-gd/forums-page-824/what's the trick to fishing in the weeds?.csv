358390,commie,2009-07-04 03:58:00,29,"I am still a fairly new fisherman, mostly going for Bass's...Having some success by using soft plastics with jigheads..(grubs, worms, senko's, gulp minnows,etc...) in the edge of weedbed.  but i can't seem to figure out how to fish inside the weedbeds.  Every cast, and I retrieve my hook/liine gets lots of weed...Tried texas rigging, or using weedless hooks, and I still get tons of weeds, and don't get the fish?  What is the trick to fishing in the weeds, without pulling weed out or managing to catch fish?"
358391,markiemark70,2009-07-04 04:08:00,158,"Never tried the weedless hooks myself, but when fishing inside weeds I usually go for a texas rig WITH a skinhook (im sure there is a videa on the web, but basically it is just burying the point of the hook back into the plastic slightly)  Also find that weights or the knots where I tie on a leader can catch weeds if I am not careful, so I usually go weightless with Senkos in the weeds."
358414,Greencoachdog,2009-07-04 10:21:00,8163,"  The same here, except I prefer a big plastic Lizard rigged weightless and ""skin"" hooked. I also use the 30 lb test green spiderwire, because when you catch a big fish in the weeds you're usually going to have to haul in just as many weeds as fish... 5 pounds of fish and 5 lbs. of weeds!"

358441,Sawyer,2009-07-04 12:38:00,48,"Hi Commie,  All the techniques that folks have mentioned thus far will work in the weeds and needs to be accompanied by patience (lots of it).  You will get hanged up quite a bit but with persistence will pay great dividends.  -Sawyer"
358446,jediangler,2009-07-04 12:58:00,1923,"Sawyer's right, PATIENCE. Just keep pulling those weeds off and casting back in again."
358450,dheitzner,2009-07-04 13:15:00,314,"Another consideration is the action of the rod that you're using.  A soft rod will not pull a bait through the weeds as readily as one with a stiffer action.  With a stiff rod you can kind of rip through the weeds.  If you are texas rigging or using a flippin' jig, go heavier than you would when fishing just the edges: the bait needs to get down into the strike zone quickly."
358451,ChrisK,2009-07-04 13:23:00,2772,"I guess it all depends on what your going after ?? I use  spinnerbaits in weed cover when angling for bass,pike and muskie due to the single upright hook on the bait which makes it slip through the weeds easier.You can add a single stinger hook to a spinnerbait as well to increase your hookups if they are hitting short..Now fishing for walleye in heavy weed cover is a little different...There is a method called rip jigging.. Heres the link just in case your interested.. http://www.ontariofishing.net/news/nov2006-2.html  Cheers !"
358490,Tdel,2009-07-04 16:07:00,393,When looking for bass use a Moss Boss.  Found it great in the weeds.  Drag it across lily pads slowly and let it drop off.  You can put a lot of erratic action into it to by twitching the rod.  Tom.
358501,johnnyb,2009-07-04 16:54:00,3413,"When fishing thick weeds, you're either going to take weeds off your hook, or a fish    My approach is to just work the spot that my lure lands in...if I'm using a texas rigged worm, I let it sink right down in there...twitch it a bit here and there, but mostly leave it and wait for something to pick it up.  If nothing happens, and I can't pull it out without hanging up on a pile of salad, I just rip it hard, hoping to get the weeds off.  I've caught walleye in the middle of a sunny summer afternoon doing this...they like to bury themselves in there.  And you'll get lots of hits as your rip the lure free...as mentioned above, a relatively stiff rod is a big help in this situation."
