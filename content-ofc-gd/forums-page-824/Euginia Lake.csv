357195,jediangler,2009-06-30 17:40:00,1923,It's a crystal clear water lake so I usually use natural looking presentations. Caught my first drop shot fish from there last year.

357254,charlesn,2009-06-30 20:43:00,551,"Don't run wide open behind the island unless you are a gambler, some deadheads and stumps around just under the surface that could do some damage.  It's a good little lake, but it's gonna be chock full of boats (it always is on Canada Day) and when a lake is heavily pressured, finesse techniques can outproduce the more traditional techniques that work better on active fish.  Good luck, you'll need it with that line up of good sticks on the water!"
