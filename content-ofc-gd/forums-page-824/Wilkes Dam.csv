I was hoping to try fly fishing from there and possibly down stream. What sort of fish could one except to catch?  I was ""googling"" the river (satellite view) of the Grand and thought I would ask before heading out. Thanks for any information."

Fishing can be pretty good there at times, but is fished frequently at the dam.  Theres some good stretches down river, then gets really shallow, but you got a good walk before you hit the shallows.  I've caught smallies, pike, rockies and mooneyes there.  It's definately worth a try though, let us know how you did and good luck."
