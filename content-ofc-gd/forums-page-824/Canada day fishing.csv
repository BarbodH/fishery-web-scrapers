I got frustrated and decided to go for some smallmouth. We caught lots of good size perch (dinner) and a bunch of small smallies (which is a good sign) but only one nice one.  I managed to coax a 3.4 pounder to hit my crankbait.  Got home and it was still fairly early in the morning.  A fun start to Canada day! Lots of nice perch out there  loads of these little bass which tells me that the resident population seems healthy.  These little guys will hit lures about the same size as them.   This is a nice 3.4 pound Simcoe smallie. Not a huge fish but a nice one. "
