I hooked up with a buddy who actually outfished me with numbers today. He caught a total of 6 fish, 3 Sunfish, 1 Rock Bass, and 2 Smallies that were in the 6-7 inch range. He was targetting panfish with his light gear so that is why he was landing the small ones.  I only managed one fish all day and it came at 2:30pm. Only took me 7 hours to land one. I had numerous bites all day and actually lost a couple of small ones.  It was well worth the wait as it was a nice 18 incher that weighed in at 3 lbs 4 oz. After I landed it, I thought it would weigh a bit more so I was disappointed with the weight. I really thought it would be in the 4+ lb range. Put up a nice fight and peeled some line off, tightened the drag and brought him in from the weedy depths. 9FOW to be exact. Caught on a CAROLINA RIG.  The day started out very cloudy and overcast, had a bit of rain for less then 5 minutes but then it cleared up and was a really great day.  Action wa slow. Not many fish landed by other boats. OPP cruised by near Margaret Island but did not stop anyone. They rolled up and some boats out of the way that may or may not have been drinking. If you are heading out, stay safe and don't drink and boat because the POLICE are out there.  All in all a nice day, well worth it after landed an 18"" monster. Gonna make a nice dinner.
