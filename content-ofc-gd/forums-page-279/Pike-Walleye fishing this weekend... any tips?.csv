Any tips for catching walleye and pike at this time of year? Certain depths or lure selections that I should consider? If you are familiar with the area and wish to know the name of the lake, shoot me a pm. Having a sort of fishing competition between the group of us, and haven't ever fished out that a ways. It does look like a very interesting lake with many islands and rock piles, shallow bays and narrows.  Thanks for any help fellas."
