810623,Sinker,2013-10-03 00:25:00,8692,"Yeah, lots. Got one yesterday LOL  S."
810628,Christopheraaron,2013-10-03 00:38:00,3525,"Those feathers are still around, I don't use them too often but they look great when I do use em  and I'll definitely take duck and goose, probably just not the plumage, but wing/shoulder/tail is always good. The barred teal feathers would be great, as would any out of the ordinary stuff."
810642,Sinker,2013-10-03 01:07:00,8692,I just took some wooducks and teals to the dump today. Never even thought to keep some.  I'll. Save some from my next trip for ya.  S.
810653,NAW,2013-10-03 01:28:00,4022,I still have a coon tail in my freezer for ya Chris!
810654,Rod Caster,2013-10-03 01:31:00,5784,"Sending a PM, Chris.  Saw another couple birds tonight on a short walk but nothing killied. Next week should start freezing the greenery up a bit."
810656,Sinker,2013-10-03 01:35:00,8692,I saw a grouse in my yard tonight. Seems to be lots around here this year. More than usual. I'm gonna have to go for a walk with the shotgun.  S.
810693,Christopheraaron,2013-10-03 04:28:00,3525,"Yup, and I may be back up that way Sunday, ill let you know."
808751,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 18:43:00,8333,Anybody else getting wound up for chickens?  I'm sitting here on a rainy day thinking about how I can best use my free time to get some more fishing and hunting trips in the next few weeks.  I feel a bit like a huntin' dog the day before the season starts.
808753,misfish,2013-09-21 18:52:00,29133,"Tell me about it Rob. When the rain started last night,and continued all day,I was not a happy fella. I did go and pick up a nice river combo from a member today though.  I got  7 days vacation coming. I,ll be making the best of it.  Im wondering how the float tube will be shooting some water fowl?"
808768,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 19:50:00,8333,Is the tube camoed?  Never thought of useing a float tube for ducks. I think I'd borrow my brother's gun for that.
808773,misfish,2013-09-21 20:01:00,29133,"  I,ll let ya know how it works out,,as Im going to be doing it on saturday out in Oro."
808783,Rod Caster,2013-09-21 20:34:00,5784,Its a good weekend to be taking my hunting and gun safety course
808798,SBCregal,2013-09-21 23:12:00,688,I can't wait.  Headed up north next weekend!
808802,NAW,2013-09-21 23:23:00,4022,I was pounding local woodies this morning in the rain.  But would love to table a few chickens this year!  Do you travel far to hunt them?  And Brian..  Good luck with the tube.  Should work out nice.  Could have used one today...
808805,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 23:34:00,8333,"I haven't hunted them in this area before but I've been out scouting a few spots this summer with mixed results. I've also been using google maps, topos and some land use maps to find some new spots. I don't have the days/time to drive up to North Bay like the ""old days""."
808822,Nipfisher,2013-09-22 02:26:00,2449,Took my boys (4 and 10) out for a drive tonight in the rain. No birds but the boys fired the pellet gun and the oldest shot my .22.  With the pellet gun my oldest was 3/3 on pop cans from 25' and went 4/5 after I backed him up to almost 40'.  Me and the oldest are going in the morning.
809313,little mountain,2013-09-24 22:26:00,16,i was north of Northbay this past week lots of chickens. about an equal amount of spuce as rughed grouse this year. never saw the spruce numbers this high befor. Lakers were biting too
810182,SBCregal,2013-10-01 02:46:00,688,"Didn't manage to get any birds this trip out, the bush is still pretty thick.  Hopefully some leaves will drop in the next few weeks before I go back up thanksgiving weekend."
810186,kickingfrog,2013-10-01 03:02:00,8333,"Didn't manage to get any birds this trip out, the bush is still pretty thick.  Hopefully some leaves will drop in the next few weeks before I go back up thanksgiving weekend. Ya, thick is one way to put it. They'll start to drop soon."
810188,Sinker,2013-10-01 03:11:00,8692,"I've been seeing good numbers of grouse this year. I haven't been out for them yet, but the ducks have been cooperating nicely  S."
810256,Rod Caster,2013-10-01 15:53:00,5784,"I know the ruffed grouse are around, but the bush is so thick that we can't get any clear shots or we keep spooking them. Oh well, lots of time left and the leaves are really starting to drop now."
810442,little mountain,2013-10-02 01:40:00,16,just reading another post about 22s. do any of u grouse hunters one? i use a 20 g over/under with #6 shot.but the 22 sounds like fun
810455,bare foot wader,2013-10-02 02:28:00,1354,"I use a 22 and 17hmr on grouse quite often, with the new rimfires (wmr/hmr)  you need to be careful of your backdrop, the 17 is chrono'ed at about 2300 fps and will pass through and keep going, something to consider.....strictly neck/head shots  I've also seen many breast shot birds with a 22 fly or stumble away, hard to recover without a dog....I really like the cci skived tip ammo or hornady xtp I think it's called...the breast will be salvagable if you hit it, not unlike the ammo marketed as 'varmint'...don't use that stuff on grouse, with a bad shot you won't get much left other than training bird or fly tying supply   I know the ruffed grouse are around, but the bush is so thick that we can't get any clear shots or we keep spooking them. Oh well, lots of time left and the leaves are really starting to drop now.  when they spook, are they completely gone or will they rest in a nearby tree? if they take cover in a tree, shoot from the bottom up first, less likely to flush the rest that way"
810458,bare foot wader,2013-10-02 02:38:00,1354,"here's a poorly hit bird, entry and exit hole, a little shot loss but overall not bad....would be very different a varmint round LOL   "
810476,Nipfisher,2013-10-02 04:57:00,2449,I generally use a .410 for birds but I have brought my .22 out the last 2 times. I like the .410 better for birds but the .22 is cheaper and more fun to fire at pop cans.
810496,BillM,2013-10-02 12:32:00,17367,20g for birds and the 12g as well.   Still way too many leaves up on the trees for us to go out.  Need some cool weather so those leaves will drop!

The wind helped yesterday, but the low-lying green stuff needs a few frosts to knock it down."
810516,Christopheraaron,2013-10-02 15:08:00,3525,"Little off topic, but as usual I will take any feathers or fur off anything you guys kill"
810521,Rod Caster,2013-10-02 15:49:00,5784,want rabbit hair? Give me a few months and I'll have more rabbit hair than I know what to do with.
810542,Christopheraaron,2013-10-02 18:16:00,3525,Yes please! Does the skin come with?
810612,Sinker,2013-10-03 00:03:00,8692,"Chris, if you want duck or goose feathers, let me know, and let me know what specie of duck too....I get a mix of everything. How'd the turkey feathers work out for you?  S."
810619,NAW,2013-10-03 00:18:00,4022,Have you ever shot a widgeon before Sink??  In this area...
