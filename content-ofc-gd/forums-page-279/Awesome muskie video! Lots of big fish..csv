808850,limeyangler,2013-09-22 12:11:00,5204,Good vid Ben. Still at Moosehorn?
808851,Rich Clemens,2013-09-22 12:18:00,3131,"Gray work Ben Love the shot where your lifting the first fish out of the net ....  The size of the head on that beast.  WOW.  I have to ask, what kind of a net are you using there.  Looks nice and big to handed those fish ??"
808856,Handlebarz,2013-09-22 12:50:00,3790,very cool Ben thanks for taking the time to put that together I know it takes a lot of time to do it.

809036,Moosebunk,2013-09-23 02:54:00,3970,This has been watched more than once.
809131,trapshooter,2013-09-23 18:47:00,1234,Thanks gang.  Simon - hope to see you on the ice this winter.  We need to get caught up and catch some fish together again.  Rich - The net I own is a beckman Pen FinSaver.  It's the one with the green hoop.  There's also a Frabill Big Kahoona in the video.  Both work well and are probably the most important release tool you can have.
809257,Believer,2013-09-24 17:03:00,40,Great vid especially the one at 3:17  Soo pumped to go to LSC in a few weeks
809265,cram,2013-09-24 18:10:00,1733,Great video.  Provided a really nice mental escape from the office this afternoon.
809540,trapshooter,2013-09-26 11:59:00,1234," I had to go back and see which one you were talking about.  That fish at 3:17 is the only hit I've got on camera... and it was  a F8 fish no less!  That was near the end of a tough day.  The kid who caught it was ready to pack up and go in but I talked him into another spot or 2.  Glad I did.  I completely missed the boat side jump after he hooked it as I turned for the net.  It's never easy, but it's always exciting.  Good luck at LSC!"

810344,trapshooter,2013-10-01 19:41:00,1234,Great vid and love that band. Trampled by turtles. Turtles are solid!  Had you heard of them before my video?  Not many have.  They are from Duluth.
810348,landry,2013-10-01 19:51:00,1005,I discovered them earlier this summer by chance on youtube and bought two of their albums. Nice vid.
