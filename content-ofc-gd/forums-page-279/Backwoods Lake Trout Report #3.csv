The weather can be hit and miss at this time of year in central Ontario but this year on our trip the weather was sunny, warm and calm for most of the trip. The trail ride in on the quads was uneventful and we made it to the lake in good time . I was quite surprised to see blackflies or small skeeters in some of the open areas of the trail (trade off to the beauty weather) but once we made it to the lake they were gone. At the end of the trail at our destination lake the sight is something to see especially at this time of year . I will let the pictures do the talking .  The water colour in this lake is a blue/green colour that can only be described as ""Wow"" compared to all surrounding lakes that are tea colour        The lakers in this lake are mostly planktivorous which make them smaller but they are all great looking fish and fight hard . The lake trout average around 2-3 lbs with the odd 6lber caught every trip . The smallmouth are abundant especially out in open water cruising around in large schools following the pods of baitfish around . They were quite easy to locate on the finder and all it took was a drop of a gulp minnow into the pack below and you had a smallmouth on (lots of fun) with a couple always following it up boat side . The lake trout were all jigged out of 40-60 ft of water with the odd one up shallow (15ft) on top of the shoals . The smallmouth were all caught suspended in 10-20ft over 40ft . The water temps. were a little warm for this time of year (61 -64F) but it didn't bother the fish . The bait of choice was 1oz white bucktails or darter head jigs with a gulp minnow or white/silver flukes. The lake trout were mostly hitting light which made a trailer hook a must . Here is a couple pictures of some of our lake trout .      This lake trout has been caught by 3 different people in our group in 3 different years , you can tell by the marking on the side and tail . I guess live release does work and no fishing pressure helps as well .You don't see that every day if ever !    The sun sets on another great year at this spot but we will be back in May 2014 for some great laker action . Let the planning begin    Cheers "

810487,solopaddler,2013-10-02 11:00:00,8605,Outstanding! I find it pretty interesting for a tiny inland lake that the smallies were suspended in schools over deep water. Interesting pattern!
