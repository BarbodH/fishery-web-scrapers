809806,aplumma,2013-09-28 21:15:00,6896,Thank you as always Roy for getting invision to get rid of of a few more glitches. We have unfortunately had to keep our upgrades up to date which changes the way the board looks and works to keep us from getting hacked and viruses. I am impressed with the way invision has keep us out of deep trouble over the years they seem to be worth all of the money we pay them.

809768,Twocoda,2013-09-28 03:45:00,4130,(More Reply Options) ...is there something i need to upgrade to work with the new software update?
809770,fishindevil,2013-09-28 09:52:00,6254,Don't know if it's related or not but I'm always on OFC with my iPhone 5 and it usually always stays signed in and at 3am this morning it would not accept my password and took about 5 tries before I could sign in ??? That has never happened before ?? Like I said might not be related but I never ever have a problem with always being on my smartphone .... Hope we didn't get hit by a hacker or a virus ?? Huh ....
809775,Rod Caster,2013-09-28 11:42:00,5784,"I still can't view OFC mobile properly on my Blackberry. Same issues I had months ago, if I switch the mobile page on my phone, then it defaults to the mobile page next time I go on my laptop, then I change it on my laptop and some weird pseudo-OFC shows back up on my phone...round and round I go. It really sucks navigating OFC on the phone, even a Z10 model."
809778,kickingfrog,2013-09-28 12:19:00,8333, I've had the same issue with my android phone.
