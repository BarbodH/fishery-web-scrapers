810098,mistyriver1,2013-09-30 18:16:00,600,They have them at Lakair.  Good luck !
810108,irishfield,2013-09-30 19:52:00,26272,"Yah, just ask Kevin or Leslie if they have the chart in stock. Navionics shows NOTHING West of the hwy 64 bridge so you can't depend on your Lowrance..."
810112,lew,2013-09-30 20:18:00,12766,"Navionics shows NOTHING West of the hwy 64 bridge so you can't depend on your Lowrance...  Your Navionics will show most things EAST of 64 but be aware that 1/2 the channel markers show the WRONG colour on your screen, at least on my Hotmaps, and if you go by your GPS in the fog or after dark, you could be sitting hi & dry on the rocks."

810114,Raf,2013-09-30 20:21:00,3495,"wow, that's some dodgy detail.  always a good idea to lay down a 'track' in ideal conditions and follow it when they are not ideal.  helps a lot esp. in completely uncharted areas."

810131,Whopper,2013-09-30 22:12:00,2174,"That is some sound advice Raf, just wished the guy I was following would have waited on me lol"
810139,aplumma,2013-09-30 22:35:00,6896,Lay your track slowly in areas that Kevin will tell you about. You also can follow the veteran Joey and Tybo to get your tracks laid.   Art
810160,Daplumma,2013-10-01 00:58:00,1961,They no longer maintain the buoys west of the bridge.We had to learn how to get around after we quit bringing the jet boats up and had to use a prop.Its not that hard but lay down a good track and stick to it until you are comfortable. Joe
