810095,fishinfool,2013-09-30 17:51:00,366,"This is my first year hunting bear, we put out 5 big rotten salmon out of Bowmanville and man did they stink. We also put out a big green garbage bag of old Timmie's donuts and they did not touch any of it. I've been told that a bear can smell about 100 times better than a man, I think they were smelling the human scent either connected to the rubbermaid container that we had the fish in or they smelled and were aware of our guy in the stand 50 yds from the bait. They didn't even go near it at night which really surprised me. Any thoughts from people in the know?"
810096,glen,2013-09-30 18:08:00,2641,Do you see sign of bears in the area?
810099,anders,2013-09-30 18:29:00,1168,"Lose the fish...go to a restaurant and find some old greese...grab a bunch.  When you set  the bait up take 1 five gallon pail and splash it on the trees and and a small area around it.  If you can also find someone with an apple tree (crab apples are good too) that aren't using them grab a lot, the ones on the ground are good to.  When you do go hunting and I am assuming you are in a blind, take a tin with some honey and sugar in the bottom of  it and burn it using a propane torch.  You will know it is working when the smoke from the tin just starts throwing out the white smoke...let in burn for a little bit, this smoke gets around and will stick to the trees as well as go with the wind and will bring the bears to you."
810103,NAW,2013-09-30 19:24:00,4022,"There are a million tricks.  Try googling it, or watching some u-tube videos.  Definitely don't use rotting fish.  You used TSC cheap cheap dog food last year for my main food.  And then added cheap Walmart maple syrup, and juice/jello mix power, molasses.  They eat it up!!     "
810104,misfish,2013-09-30 19:29:00,29133,Good luck FnF  Good eats.
810128,Rod Caster,2013-09-30 22:01:00,5784,"Training them usually takes a bit a time. Start baiting at least a couple weeks (every few days) before you want to sit in your blind. They'll get used to your scent and your activity...at least to some degree.  I put out dog food, donuts, cheap syrop and any grease leftovers from cooking. I've had something hit the bait 4 out of the past 5 days now...that's after about a month of fairly regular baiting. I've also made it a point to visit the baiting area late at night sometimes; apparently too much activitiy during the day can push them nocturnal.  Good luck!"
810187,Twocoda,2013-10-01 03:05:00,4130,Chapmans strawberry ice cream    tim hortons apple cinnamon tea (triple triple)     and just in case you dont get to see one....here are a few for ya                    There that should give you something to think about while you wait for your shot...good luck with your hunt...
810553,fishinfool,2013-10-02 19:09:00,366,"Lots of great information here guys, I will press on and keep trying with all of these. There is bear scat everywhere with lots of berries showing in the scat. They are feeding hard on the junipers and berries all over this 100 acres. I guess I need to be patient and trust what I have been told. I will let you know when we bag one.  SS"
810563,glen,2013-10-02 20:07:00,2641,Did you put up a trail cam to see what time they come to the bait? Good luck.
