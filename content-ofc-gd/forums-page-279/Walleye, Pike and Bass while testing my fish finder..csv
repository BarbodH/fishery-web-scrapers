Went down to Williams Bay on Lac Seul this morning and got to test out my 'new to me ' fish finder', works pretty good.  Time was a major factor in my success rate today. Although i caught a nice mixed bag of species, the usual walleye tally was way down, I did not have time to head up the lake and I had in my mind that if I ran into issues there were no other boats around, cant say I would be too bothered about spending a couple of days on an island waiting for pick up(i go prepared) but Jack would not be impressed when nobody showed to pick him up  .  Here is a video from my morning.  "
