810214,2 tone z71,2013-10-01 12:23:00,1311,something decent for target and bird ..teach the boys how to shoot...any suggestions ? new or used don't matter
810226,Fang,2013-10-01 13:48:00,1330,As a learning tool I'd suggest staying with a bolt action. Allows a bit more control between shots. Another aspect for safety and teaching kids to shoot is having a magazine. Very easy way to teach safety with a loaded gun - bolt action vs tube feed when you can open the bolt and remove the magazine to check if gun is still loaded  Lots of options out there and some very interesting choices can be seen on sites like Epps in Orillia. They have a Tyrol 22 right now at a very good price. This is a very well put together rimfire rifle but may be a little unknown if you need it worked on.
810228,NAW,2013-10-01 13:55:00,4022,I kind of want one of these for playing in the bush...  http://www.mossberg.com/product/rifles-autoloading-rimfire-international-715t-flat-top/37207  
810239,OhioFisherman,2013-10-01 14:40:00,6623,"There are a number of decent ones out there at a low price by a variety of different manufacturers. It's basically a chevy ford chrysler market, everyone has their preferences and price range?  You can see reviews of different models and brands on youtube."
810248,ch312,2013-10-01 15:23:00,1590,"How old are the kids? Which action do you prefer? Bolt, lever, semi, break... Do you plan on mounting a scope or using iron sights?"
810260,GbayGiant,2013-10-01 16:00:00,1780,The Ruger 10/22 all around great rifle that will last for years of Plinking.  http://www.ruger.com/products/1022/
810288,Rich Nelson,2013-10-01 17:11:00,332,"Agreed. Ruger 10/22 is a great gun, with tons of accesories"
810307,bare foot wader,2013-10-01 18:27:00,1354,"I'm a big fan of savage rimfires (not sure which models are still made in lakefield though), the accutrigger I find helps new shooters with trigger control and is a decent trigger, easy to adjust"
810397,bare foot wader,2013-10-01 22:22:00,1354,"just because I bought a new rimfire a few months ago, and after I found out which ammo it shot best, I showed my buddy the difference between ammo in the same gun.....100 yds, 3 types of ammo, 2 shooters (me on the right)  super accurate, love it for grouse and rabbits.....my dog gets jealous when I take birds on longer shots, he'll sit beside me while i shoot, but he voices his unhappiness...until he gets the command to go get em LOL  grouse from last night, 130 yds  "
810403,krixxer,2013-10-01 22:46:00,274,"Guns; I like me some guns! and since I like you I'd suggest NO: 10/22's or Savages., Yes they shoot and yes they are prices to sell but you'll never love them.  starting at $250 https://www.canadaammo.com/product/detail/norinco-em332-match-sporting-rifle-22lr/  around $500 you can have http://www.wolverinesupplies.com/details/9061/CZ-452-American-22-LR-Bolt-Action-American-Style-Beech-Wood-Stock-No-Sights.aspx  and then at 1k you can break into Anschutz and I'll guarantee they are worth it!"
810405,kickingfrog,2013-10-01 22:54:00,8333,I've been kicking around what to get myself. I've been using my dad/brother's 10/22 but I want my own.  It will be a bolt action but other than that I haven't narrowed it down much.
810412,bare foot wader,2013-10-01 23:37:00,1354,"krixxer, where do you find Anschutz in Canada? I couldn't find one when I was looking to buy  that's a good looking website, never seen it before, thanks for linking it, afternoon productivity has haulted...  here's a deal for the OP, if the gun wasn't cool enough on it's own, you got skull camo for the kids lol  http://www.wolverinesupplies.com/details/14737/Savage-93R17-Bolt-Action-17-HMR-Skull-Camo-21-Barrel-Synthetic-Stock.aspx"
810422,krixxer,2013-10-02 00:14:00,274,"The crown jewel of my collection is a Anschutz 1712 Silhouette.  find the model here: http://www.anschuetz-sport.com/  then call Peter: http://www.targetshootingproducts.com/   entry price is 1k,  they get good closer to 2k and 3-4k buys you a biathlon rifle"
810426,NAW,2013-10-02 00:28:00,4022,"grouse from last night, 130 yds  That sounds like fun!!!"
