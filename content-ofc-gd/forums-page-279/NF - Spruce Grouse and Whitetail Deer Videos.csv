Was lucky to find my first spruce grouse the other week while searching for moose in Algonquin Park. Very cool birds. Have also been spending a lot of time at my deer spots here in Ottawa, shooting both still images and film of whitetail behaviour, etc. The bucks are beginning to show themselves, so the real fun is just beginning. Here are two short videos for those that enjoy nature and wildlife."

810245,ehg,2013-10-01 15:06:00,2666,Well done videos! Not a hunter but those birds and deer look like they would be good eats.  Good stuff!
