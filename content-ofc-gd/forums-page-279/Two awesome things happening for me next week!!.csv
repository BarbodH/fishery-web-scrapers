809840,danc,2013-09-29 01:02:00,4677,"As a Leafs fan, this one is obvious. Reg season starts Tuesday. I'm pretty pumped about the Leafs this year. Let's see how the Leafs and my buddy Dion do this year.     But the most exciting thing about next week for me is my annual trek to Kansas City for NASCAR chase race #4. This will be year #11 for me. What a fun week this is. Besides the race, we'll be attending the largest bbq competition in North America. The American Royal. It's just another big party. But before I leave on Wednesday, I have to get through two 10 hour days working along side tanks of huge Brook Trout, Lake Trout and Steelhead in a hatchery. Damn.  "

809847,danc,2013-09-29 01:31:00,4677,"Yup, be kind to your liver this week so it can keep up with you next week  Have a blast bud, which I was joining you!!!  ** Tony Stewart pictures please**  lol. Thanks Joey. Not sure if I'll be able to get any Tony in his wheelchair shots, but you never know."
809849,Joey,2013-09-29 01:50:00,9122,"Oh jeez, I haven't been watching lately, wheelchair???  Must google that!!!"
809850,danc,2013-09-29 01:55:00,4677,"Oh jeez, I haven't been watching lately, wheelchair???  Must google that!!! Wow Joey. He broke his leg in a sprint race about a month ago. He's done for the season. Mark Martin is driving his cup car for the rest of the year. Tony is in a wheelchair now."
809851,Moosebunk,2013-09-29 02:03:00,3970,"Have fun Dan.  Understood how much you look forward to your annual trip... and don't you worry about the Leafs while you're gone, because unlike you, they won't be going anywhere again this year."
809855,danc,2013-09-29 02:09:00,4677,"Have fun Dan.  Understood how much you look forward to your annual trip... and don't you worry about the Leafs while you're gone, because unlike you, they won't be going anywhere again this year. Ha ha Drew. They may not be going to the Cup finals this year, But they'll be a fun team to watch for sure. Still waiting for your mid September report by the way."
809865,Joeytier,2013-09-29 06:37:00,3990,"Man i hate nascar, but id go back to NC for those massive tailgate parties in a heartbeat."
809870,wormdunker,2013-09-29 10:30:00,1711,Leafs?  That's like cheering for the Bills!
809885,Bernie,2013-09-29 12:37:00,3190,Have a great time Dan! Going to a NASCAR race is much more than the race itself.
809906,aplumma,2013-09-29 16:25:00,6896,Go forth and enjoy my friend. Art
809924,misfish,2013-09-29 18:49:00,29133,Dont forget yer 88 flag bud.  You are a lucky fella.  Enjoy the race and party.   PS. Thats a strong looking car today.
809927,Guidofisherman,2013-09-29 19:31:00,206,Enjoy the race and don't take your spinning rod to work.
810193,danc,2013-10-01 03:52:00,4677,"Have a great time Dan! Going to a NASCAR race is much more than the race itself.  Thanks all for the well wishes, but Bernie's comment sums it up best. Four hours of Cup tire testing upon our arrival on Thursday, after we stop in at the Cabelas next to the track, Cup and NW practice and Cup qualifying followed by an ARCA championship deciding race under the lights Friday, Nationwide race Saturday, American Royal BBQ Saturday night, and the Cup race Sunday. Oh yea. Almost forgot wings and beer in Des Moines Iowa Wednesday night on the way down. And a night at the Hinckley Minnesota casino for prime rib and some blackjack Monday night on the way home. Then back to work over the Trout tanks on Wednesday."
