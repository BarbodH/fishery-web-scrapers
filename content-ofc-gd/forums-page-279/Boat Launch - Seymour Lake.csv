Being new to the lake can anyone tell me where I can launch my boat, either from a free launch or pay at a marina? Doesn't matter to me. I have a Lund Explorer 1675 with a Evinrude 90 E-Tec. So a launch where one has to carry the boat to the water wouldn't work for me.  Also any tips or hints for Largemouth and Pike? I plan on finding remaining green weeds and fish the edges or just over the weed tops with spinnerbaits and crankbaits.  What type of structure is found within the lake?  Thanks."
