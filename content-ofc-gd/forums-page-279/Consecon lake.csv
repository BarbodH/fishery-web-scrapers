809985,Hud,2013-09-29 23:37:00,140,Went and looked at some land on the west end of the lake.   The water looks really weedy but it was hard to tell how deep it is.   Anyone spend time on this lake?   People seem to say decent things about the lake but I can't tell if it's deep enough to dock a boat
810029,DT10Sam,2013-09-30 02:58:00,480,"I have spent some time on the lake fishing and the fishing is actually not bad. The deepest part is approximately 22 feet deep. Lots of pan fish and pike. Consecon flows into Weller's Bay and then out to Lake Ontario.  Regards, Sam"
810048,fishindevil,2013-09-30 07:42:00,6254,Have not fished it for about a dozen years but it did have lots of bass and did even have walleyes in it !!!! Pike as well !!  And yes you can have a boat on it no problems !!!! We fished it out of a 14ft tinnie with a 15hp !!! I remember the launch being off county rd 1 ?? Near the west end of the lake by the dam I believe !! And there is awesome fishin only a few clocks away as there is west lake and Lake Ontario and the bay of quinte. All right there !!!!!!  It was a nice spot as I remember it !!  Hope this helps !!! Been a while since I was there
