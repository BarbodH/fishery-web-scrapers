809458,fishindevil,2013-09-25 21:08:00,6254,"Buddy was there last weekend on Sunday !!! Said around point Anne hitting the weed edges and first drop offs with Texas rigged worms and was dropshotting swammers !!!!! 8-15ft he said !!! Depending on where you are launching there is the upper bay,middle bay and of course the lower area !!!! If you are hitting the middle bay try around foresters island and mowhawk bay and green point for smallies !!!! Good luck.   Cheers"
809557,gotfish,2013-09-26 14:40:00,53,Thanks. I will be fishing around big bay and towards telegraph narrows. might get down trenon way as well. I know were point anne and foresters island is but not sure about mowhawk bay and green point.
809561,Luke V.,2013-09-26 15:21:00,286,Weedeges are your best bet 7-10 ft Dropshot Senkos And crank baits Tons of fish there keep moving around the Weedeges and ull find a concentration of them for sure.
810071,gotfish,2013-09-30 13:37:00,53,Thanks for the tips guys. Caught alot of LM on the weekend thowing spinner baits in 6 -10 FOW. Got a few SM on a jerk bait at the mouth of the trent river. All in all an amazing weekend at a great fishery. Sorry camera pouched out on me so no pictures just memories.
