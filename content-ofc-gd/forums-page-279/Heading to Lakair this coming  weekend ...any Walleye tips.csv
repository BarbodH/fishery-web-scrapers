808958,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 23:28:00,2984,Slooooow drift with a Lindy rig. Extremely light bite. My best results are the last hour before dark. Know your slot size.
808959,Nipfisher,2013-09-22 23:38:00,2449,Walleye are still deep but moving in. Start around 22-25 fow and move in from 5:30 till dark. Worms are still catching lots of fish.

809119,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 17:38:00,8333,"I had good luck fishing neck-down areas between islands, or islands and the mainland provided there was deepish water (>10ft) between."
809431,2 tone z71,2013-09-25 18:43:00,1311,Lew ..how long are ya staying ...Id like to get lil momma into a Muskie up there Sat
809579,Fish4Eyes,2013-09-26 17:41:00,1022,"Some very good advice above. Like others, most of my fishing is done in narrows lindy rigging. Set your trolling motor to the slowest speed possible that will keep the boat moving. White, orange and pink are my go to jig colours, white being the preferred. Good luck."
809597,lew,2013-09-26 20:43:00,12766," I'm already home Darrell, it was just a quick trip for a change of scenery.  I fished 5 hours Tuesday & all day yesterday but things were pretty quiet with just a mid 40's musky and a few pike.  Water is quite cloudy compared to only a month ago with visibility about 3 feet and temps range from high 50's to low 60's.  Sorry I'm gonna miss you guys but good luck and enjoy your trip."
