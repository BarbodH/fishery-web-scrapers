It is a fairly large lake that has a good population of lake trout and receives very little fishing pressure due to it's remoteness . Anyways , one of the lake trout that I caught was the same one as a friend of mine caught last year which was the same one that was caught the previous year . Yes , the same lake trout caught by 3 different people in 3 different years . You can tell by the scar on the side and deformity in the tail . This was found out last year while I was going through some pictures and noticed the scar on the side of the fish , so we were on the lookout this year and sure enough I caught the same fish for the third time . I have never heard of this happening , yes twice but never three times . I guess live release and good handling works. You guys be the judge  August 2011    September 2012    September 2013    "
810478,Muskieman,2013-10-02 09:38:00,2472,wow ! that's something else !
810482,Musky or Specks,2013-10-02 10:20:00,2710,Amazing. Proof positive of a fish is to valuable a resource to be caught only once.
810488,Sharkbait22,2013-10-02 11:00:00,297,"Likely means the population is pretty small or you always catch most of the fish, and catch and release can work very well."
810504,jimmer,2013-10-02 13:50:00,2730,That fish didn't grow much in three years. Live release works obviously!
810507,mistaredone,2013-10-02 14:07:00,913,Wow!  That's loto odds
810512,RDR,2013-10-02 15:04:00,125,"That's unreal! I hope your ""Pet"" will be waiting for you next year."
