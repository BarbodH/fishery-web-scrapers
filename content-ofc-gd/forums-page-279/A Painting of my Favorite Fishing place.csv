809858,pidge,2013-09-29 03:09:00,438,Thats a pretty cool thing she went and did for ya. I like that.
809863,Old Ironmaker,2013-09-29 04:59:00,8243,"As an individual that struggles to get paint to canvas I must really disagree as to the quality of the painting. Some have refereed to it as pretty slick, pretty cool, pretty neat, really neat, life like, etc. etc.  I would say the recreation of the moment captured in the photograph could only be described as a both brilliant an successful journey that the artist made. She should be very proud of her work and I must say it does remind me of a world renowned artist from Burlington Ontario. He is now known for his work of natural settings of wildlife. In his earlier works his lifelike realism took us into the world of sports. One being his portrait of a young Ken Dryden. He is Robert Bateman. This artist work is worthy of an early Bateman. Hold onto it my friend like it is a bar of gold."
809882,Rod Caster,2013-09-29 12:29:00,5784,"My Dad does a lot of paintings (actually painted with Robert Bateman years ago) and I can see that this is a great painting! I'd put that on my wall in a heartbeat! Congrats, and great decision to commission Lew for a photo! haha."

As I mentioned before, I'm very pleased with it and will certainly have it for as long as I live."

809677,mistyriver1,2013-09-27 16:02:00,600," Hi all.  Just over a month ago while I was up at Nipissing, I met up with Lew on the water and he snapped this picture of me. I was really pleased with the way it turned out and since i didnt have any other pictures like it I decided to have a lady I work with paint it for me. I'm really pleased with the way it turned out and thought some might enjoy it.  Jim       "
