The question, is a floor necessary? Without a floor (lawn chairs on the ice) the hut would be a lot lighter, has anyone had experience with a permanent hut without a floor? Disadvantages?  thanks  Chris"

809973,Fisherman,2013-09-29 22:57:00,7201,The big thing I would question is dragging it around on the ice with no floor unless it's only going to one spot for the whole season.

I'm not worried about when it's set up so much as about when you go to move it.  Also, getting your boots up off the ice makes a big difference in keeping your feet warm.  IMO, the weight you save isn't worth it.  Bah!..what do I know?  My hut weighs about a ton."
