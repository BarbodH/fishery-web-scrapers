809822,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-28 23:01:00,4399,"Just wondering how to get Navionics charts up and running, I was out on Simcoe and could not get any detail. I have the chart set to Navionics but no detail..any help would be appreciated."
809824,kickingfrog,2013-09-28 23:06:00,8333,I think I had a similar thing when I tried my Lowrence after using a hummingbird. I needed to go into settings (or something similarly labled) and choose Central Ontario or some such.
809827,irishfield,2013-09-28 23:18:00,26272,"Yes as Rob says.. you need to go into settings and pic the correct map data location as a starting point, at least I do on my LCX112C"
809828,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-28 23:18:00,4399,"Yes Rob there is a settings option of...lowrance charts, navionics canadian coastal and I think navionics inland, couldn't get detail with any of them."
809836,aplumma,2013-09-29 00:39:00,6896,ditto   Art
809839,Terry,2013-09-29 00:49:00,14456,i dont think simcoe is on the inland lake chip
809897,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-29 14:50:00,4399,"I think the bundled chip that was included is pretty much useless for me if it does not have one of the most popular lakes in southern ontario Simcoe, not sure what lakes are on this chip but as it stands now this chip is good for picking your teeth."
809931,Luke V.,2013-09-29 20:12:00,286,Good luck finding any chip that has detailed mapping for simcoe They don't exist
809943,BillM,2013-09-29 21:31:00,17367,"Good luck finding any chip that has detailed mapping for simcoe They don't exist  Sure they do, Navionics Gold+, G2 Vision bluecharts, etc etc."
809956,miller,2013-09-29 22:23:00,223,Elite 7 comes with a gold card that has the whole Trent-Severn system. Select Navionics coastal Canada for the map data.
810068,Raf,2013-09-30 12:50:00,3495,"what miller said, simcoe is on the chip.  user error."
810082,Luke V.,2013-09-30 15:25:00,286,I don't see on the Navico website anywhere that shows a Gold+  How current and up to date are these chips??  And I'm talkin about a HD/3D chip
810107,davey buoy,2013-09-30 19:41:00,5505,You would think other than the great lakes Simcoe would be next in line if nothing for it's size at least.
810153,Sinker,2013-10-01 00:24:00,8692,Mine has simcoe.......
