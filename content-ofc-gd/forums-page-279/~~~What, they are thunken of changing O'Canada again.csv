810510,oldphart,2013-10-02 14:43:00,665,"~~~I'm a widdle peed off that they are thunken of changing the words to O'Canada again, we were taught the song in the 50s, then later in the 70s it was changed, never liked that versions.so even if they do decide to change it again, I won't bother"
810513,ch312,2013-10-02 15:04:00,1590,"Yeah, because changing the lyrics will surely make a huge difference in the lives of Canadian women   This is what happens when overzealous do-gooders have nothing better to do."
810535,BillM,2013-10-02 17:24:00,17367,What are the proposed changes?
810538,lew,2013-10-02 17:52:00,12766,"What are the proposed changes?  Rather than ""all thy son's command"". they want ""all of us command""  They claim women are being ignored in this country."
810573,fishindevil,2013-10-02 20:45:00,6254,Another whiny group of activists will get there way !!!! ....
810574,davey buoy,2013-10-02 20:52:00,5505,"I have to believe you ask 100 women,I'm sure 100% would say leave it the way it is. Why are we the only country that has to change something to be politically correct?. Everyone gets it imo."
810579,Bill Shearer,2013-10-02 21:18:00,456,"Margaret Attwood the author has requested the change. I hope the various levels of checks and balances tell her it is not in the beSt interests of the majority of Canadians. In spite of the fact she is a worthy Canadian, she isn't any more worthy than the thousands of military folks that have protected and preserved our rights and freedoms since the last change. I'm old enough that I still proud ding the original lyrics. No change from the altered version is necessary. IMO"

810660,Fisherman,2013-10-03 01:48:00,7201,I could tell you why but it would be deemed a politically incorrect answer and I'd get banned from this website. Why are we the only country that has to change something to be politically correct?.

Don't they have anything better to do?? We are becoming a nation of chronic victims. Everyone feeling they need to a victim of one thing or another, and everything bad that happens to us is someone else's fault. ""My coffee is was too hot so I deserve compensation"", ""I'm not yet a citizen of this country but I don't want to pledge allegiance to the Queen so I'll take the government to court"", ""I'm offended by Christmas trees and the Lord's prayer."" ""The government spent a small fortune saving me from the war torn country I was stranded in, but they had the nerve to give me crappy (not crappie because they would be delicious) sandwiches for free"". It goes on and on and on. Gets me all worked up."

810720,dave524,2013-10-03 14:04:00,4508,"Heck , going to elementary school in the 50's I recall we did  ""God Save the Queen "" every morning  along with the Lord's Prayer, I think ""O'Canada"" didn't beome the norm untill late 60's.  Bet the lib-left would choke on those if they brought them back."
810737,Rod Caster,2013-10-03 15:43:00,5784,"Suprised they haven't pulled the god crap out of it yet either. But I dont' really care, it's part of the original lyrics, so keep it.  Margaret attwood is quite annoying and extremely condescending. Not suprised this is stemming from her.  ""all thy sons command' isn't even a male/female reference, it refers to god's son, lil' baby jebus...so any correction of the line wouldn't even provide any sexe equlity in the song, it would just remove a jebus reference..."
810741,Rich,2013-10-03 15:49:00,3927,The fact that we are talking about this means they got what they wanted. We are sufficiently distracted from any real issues.
