Im not saying it,s a bad show,  Hell,it can be a great aid to those that feel they need for help.  Blessing in black.   Enjoy. I need help,only on 3rd episode of season one lol.Only 59/58 left on the pvr lol."
810106,leaf4,2013-09-30 19:36:00,2466,"it was 75 mins long, unreal episode had my heart pounding the entire time from thinking what his next move was.  spoiler alert don't read past if you haven't seen it  As soon as I saw him in the coffee shop and Lydia had the only pack of sweetener I knew he had poisoned it and the ploy of methalamine free meth was fake overall I was pleased with the way it ended, with him finally coming to grips with the reasoning as to why he did what he did, at first it was for family as he persisted for so long, but he lost that part of himself as soon as he let his ego get in the way, the final song baby blue by bad finger summed it all up and I loved the way how he went out the way he wanted to, albeit by his own bullet but in his creation being the lab as he lay there dead, he looked like he was at peace  Guess I got what I deserved Kept you waiting there too long, my love All that time without a word Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget or I'd regret The special love I had for you, my baby blue"

It was appropriate Walt was all about his perfect creation. Dude bleed blue."
803063,BillM,2013-08-13 14:26:00,17367,"Walt goes down guns a blazing, that's the only good ending to this show.    Do you guys forget the M80 he was pulling out of a trunk of a car at the end of last season?  lol!"
803065,BucktownAngler,2013-08-13 14:29:00,582,ya he dies for sure. if he doesnt get killed it will be the cancer
803068,mattybculp,2013-08-13 15:01:00,388,I believe its ricin in that capsule. question is whom is he going to use it on ?
803069,Dozer,2013-08-13 15:17:00,896,"It is ricin - the public knows its him, housed got seized so police involvement, he's carrying heavy artillery in the back of his car, grew hair and a beard ( or bought it ) to change his identity... man on the run.  Jesse is becoming more and more unstable, Hanks situation is just unfolding, Walter White wouldn't kill himself, the writers like throwing curveballs... my guess is Walter dies but I'm not sure how.  He's getting to confident in himself and he's bound to slip up.  Can't wait for the next episode, the writers are doing an amazing job at keeping me interested in the show.  What an awesome show even though some parts were a little overboard."
808060,darsky,2013-09-17 00:59:00,586,I knew it about Hank.  TV at its best right here.
808061,leaf4,2013-09-17 01:03:00,2466,"Awesome episode, I missed it last night but thank god for PVR's I didn't have to wait for commercials!"
808084,Stoty,2013-09-17 02:54:00,2910,UNREAL show!!!!! UNREAL episode last night!  Can't wait to see what happens in the last two!  Agree that Jesse & Skyler need to go. Throw in Marie as well... she drives me nuts!
808090,tb4me,2013-09-17 03:03:00,3295,That was awesome..Hank finally got it..Walt is going to go all out in the end.Guns a blazing.Hard to believe there is 2 episodes left..
808143,ccmtcanada,2013-09-17 13:57:00,7971,I started watching this series on Netflix and got hooked!  Incredible episode last night....things seem to be unraveling towards an awesome finale!
808144,Believer,2013-09-17 14:02:00,40,I dont think Skyler dies. Didnt you see how he knew the police were listening in and pinned everything on himself so she wouldnt go down?  
808149,ccmtcanada,2013-09-17 14:32:00,7971," Unless Walt goes crazy and kills her himself....he said Jesse was ""family"" but he was prepared to watch him die.  Edit:  Weird...the last several posts are in bold...I know I didn't do that..."
808152,jedimaster,2013-09-17 14:59:00,3472,"Glad that slob of a DEA agent died. The big question is who is the ricin for. What one person dyeing will give closure to the series. I am going to say Walt does it himself after turning himself in. As much as I want Skyler to eat it along with he stupid sister. I have a feeling like they will both be standing at the end. As for Jesse. He escapes and gets away. There must be some time that has passed so perhaps in the next one, Jesse gets offed in the next one after cooking up some blue. and one of the bobsie twins or walt gets it in the finale."
808231,darsky,2013-09-17 21:28:00,586,I did hear that there WILL be a spinoff-           BETTER CALL SAUL !!!
808273,Canuck2fan,2013-09-18 01:50:00,1444,"Walt had to burn Jesse because he ""RATTED"" what else would an empire building crime boss do? LOL Too bad Todd decided to keep Jesse as his new pet. Notice Jesse didn't get a hazard suit to cook with Todd better watch his suit's air hose.....  Apparently Vince Gilligan is amazed that team Walt still thinks Walt is basically a good guy according to Dean Norris, so he is writing Walt up as the best/WORST anti hero in tv history. He had my vote until, Walt's over the top get out of jail free card for Skyler that just happened to be conveniently recorded by the police. No jury in the world is going to convict Skyler of anything after Saul plays that recording in court... Unless Ted shows up....  Did anyone else think the ""knife"" fight was staged so Jr could get up on the stand and say my dad attacked mommy and only I saved her. Giving Skyler even more leverage to stay out of jail? I think the look of shock on Walt's face from the cut was because it was an accident and not how he and Sklyer had rehearsed it...."
808285,Stoty,2013-09-18 03:28:00,2910," Ya, apparently its going to be a ""prequel"" to the series. Focuses on Saul before he met Walt/Jesse."
808290,adolson,2013-09-18 04:58:00,783,"When did they have time to rehearse this? She couldn't reach him, Marie said he was arrested... She seemed to believe that until she ran into him. I doubt she would have told her kid about his father if she knew he was still walking the streets. Walt's involvement in Hank's death - family - I think crossed the line for her. I don't think anything was rehearsed...  She obviously understands her husband well after years of marriage that she quickly caught what he was doing on the phone, and she still loves him enough to just go with it - especially since it gets her off the hook - despite (what I feel was) her honesty just minutes earlier, with pulling the knife and all that.  Exceptional writing in this show, particularly this season, that rivals the best (Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, The Killing, etc). There was only one season that I felt was too slow, and while many applauded it for character development, I felt we already had extremely well-developed characters by that point and saw it as slow-moving filler. But still, even that was a cut above many other shows on TV and the final few episodes really redemed the season."
808292,fishinguypat,2013-09-18 05:27:00,547,"With two episodes left I have to say there will be someone walking away with the money, playing walt as the anti hero to root for has to lead to him being successfull in some way... prediction jesse doesn't die.."
808324,Believer,2013-09-18 13:33:00,40,My Prediction is Walt gets back to producing meth in Latvia or where ever they were shipping it too.
808407,ah_long,2013-09-18 21:50:00,354,"I wish there's more character development to Todd, and what would come out of Todd's crush on Lydia"
808432,Canuck2fan,2013-09-19 00:50:00,1444," I think the possibility exists that Walt figured if he did get caught, even after he and Skyler made the tape, they needed other options. So he or even she might have come up with fighting in front of Jr to help keep her free to raise Holly. They had plenty of time after Hank let Walt know he was on to him to come up with lots of scenarios.  Sure Walt has been steaming for awhile, and he made a HUGE mistake going out to meet Jesse at the money....  However, this is STILL the guy who figured out so many situations before hand and had ways to deal with them that were creative to say the least wouldn't you say? Also, I didn't see Skyler being nearly as broken up about Holly being ""taken"" as she should have been, so that could have been planned too. Or maybe Anna Gunn just can't act..."
809799,leaf4,2013-09-28 19:48:00,2466,"last episode tomorrow, I really have no clue to who or what Walt is going to do, with that pre cursor of him as mr lambert getting that gun makes a lot of things possible"
809838,anders,2013-09-29 00:45:00,1168,Soprano style ending...fade to black
810090,lhousesoccer,2013-09-30 17:23:00,442,"It's Monday the 30th and I realize the show aired last night.  I got it on PVR and I have no idea what happened.  This is my guess:  Walt's going to blast the crap out of the Neo-Nazi camp with that big gun we saw in the flash forward at the beginning of the season, free Jesse, give him all the money they stole from him, and make him promise to get it to Skylar.  And then he will kill himself with the Ricin because he doesnt' want to go down from cancer.  Does anyone know if the show was 1 or 2 hours long?  I hope the PVR got it all.  I can't imagine tying up all the loose ends in 1 hour.  Hank's death/funeral/his wife.  Walt Jr.  Saul.  Lydia and Todd."
810100,anders,2013-09-30 18:31:00,1168,its 1 hour long....watch it..answers many questions
810101,misfish,2013-09-30 18:59:00,29133,"Yer all like a bunch of women watching DAYS OF OUR LIVES.  LMAO   I dont watch due to personal family reasons.  Im not saying it,s a bad show,  Hell,it can be a great aid to those that feel they need for help.  Blessing in black.   Enjoy."
802501,darsky,2013-08-10 01:53:00,586,I have not been this excited about a tv event since the final season of Lost. I predict Hank gets it.
802561,BillM,2013-08-10 15:20:00,17367,Can't wait!  Been looking forward to this...
802567,Canuck2fan,2013-08-10 15:56:00,1444,Here is hoping Jesse gets away clean... Amazing show and it is good they are going to end it while it is still going strong. Too many shows hang around for that extra year or two and it just ruins the whole experience.
802569,landry,2013-08-10 16:09:00,1005,Best show ever. Love it.
802777,big guy,2013-08-12 03:03:00,414,I suggest you tread lightly  Lol
802803,BillM,2013-08-12 11:29:00,17367," Couldn't have scripted that last scene any better!   I'm also sick of the whiney Jessie, Walt needs to off him."
802809,mattybculp,2013-08-12 13:02:00,388,"Yeah I was looking forward to this season as well I don't watch a lot of tv, but over the years I have been a big fan of lost and the walking dead. I don't know who annoys me more jesse pinkman or walts wife I think he should have offed her seasons ago. haha"
802819,Angler management,2013-08-12 13:55:00,280,Gonna make interesting news when residents report stacks on their front porch... CRAZY!!!
802820,BillM,2013-08-12 13:58:00,17367,"Those 'resident's aren't going to report anything, lol"
802822,Angler management,2013-08-12 14:10:00,280,"Hahaha ya, i certainly wouldnt... But fingerprints are all over them!!!! Man jesse drives me nuts lately!"
802832,BucktownAngler,2013-08-12 15:04:00,582,wow. amazing episode last night.  one of the few shows that keeps getting better as it goes on.
802848,msp,2013-08-12 16:12:00,1336,Is it only on HBO ? Im not sure what season I left off at. The end of the last episode I saw was when Walt blew up the main dealer guy. Am I up to date ?
802851,mattybculp,2013-08-12 16:16:00,388,No you have 1 more season I believe to catch up on to be current.
802852,BillM,2013-08-12 16:16:00,17367, Correct.
802855,Wendel,2013-08-12 16:35:00,213,"I love how they got right down to it.  Oh, and Skylar still needs to go..."
802858,BucktownAngler,2013-08-12 16:52:00,582," Its on AMC, youre 1 season behind.  you can use couch tuner to catch up   x 2 hate skylar"
802866,highdrifter,2013-08-12 17:17:00,2534, HAHAHAH!!
802871,danbouck,2013-08-12 18:08:00,4380,Season 1-5 is on Netflix
802873,mattybculp,2013-08-12 18:13:00,388,not too change the subject but does anyone watch game of thrones ? its pretty good! language is a little coarse and some nudity but im ok with that .
802907,Angler management,2013-08-12 21:19:00,280,Last i checked it was only 1-4 but season 5 just got released recently so maybe it is now.
802913,leaf4,2013-08-12 21:46:00,2466,yeah it's 1-5 but only the first half of the season since its the second half is now airing
802916,Angler management,2013-08-12 21:52:00,280,"Oh cool, it was only 1-4 few days ago. Second half of season five is called ""final season"" i beleive."
803017,Dozer,2013-08-13 02:53:00,896,Predictions?  Would love to hear what everyone thinks.
803018,Angler management,2013-08-13 02:55:00,280,"Hank takes down walter, goes into witness relocation program for ratting, then hal from malcolm in the middle is born."
803059,tb4me,2013-08-13 14:02:00,3295,"We too enjoy this show.. They did show Walt coming back to his house all fenced up and destroyed. Walt came back for the pill, cant remember what it was exactly.. So either he disappears or as some others have said he went into witness protection. Another possibility is that the Russian woman takes him into custody to get the ship righted"
