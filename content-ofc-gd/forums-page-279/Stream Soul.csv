810409,krixxer,2013-10-01 23:16:00,274,"brilliant, thank you!"
810420,MJL,2013-10-02 00:12:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you enjoyed the pictures  The last few weeks I've been feeling great (pretty much back to feeling like normal again aside from my sense of taste - besides sour & spicy I really can't taste anything else except for cheese). Yay for poutine  Rank with some of the best I've seen.  What are you using for gear? Wow.  Thanks SB22. I used 2 cameras for the pictures in this report  Above water: - Canon t3i +17-50mm f/2.8 lens - it's a fairly light combo (as far as DSLRs go) that I can wear around my neck and tuck inside the top of my waders when I'm hiking through the bush. Maybe one day I'll invest in a micro 4/3 or mirrorless system that fits in a pocket much better.  underwater: - Canon 7D + 8-15mm F/4 fisheye lens inside an aquatech surf housing + dome port.  Cheers   I can see I need to trade in my old camera guy in for a new one. LOL  Them there are some purdy fish Mike.   WOW.  The best camera is the one that's on you. haha. You can bring it next time we fish together  Although if you really want to upgrade, you can send me your credit card info and I can put together a camera package that will never become obsolete...It will cost $9,000 but it will last you a life time  Thanks again  Mike"

810566,spinnerdoc,2013-10-02 20:21:00,556,Mike how about a calendar for all your awesome pics. It would be really cool.
810569,MJL,2013-10-02 20:29:00,2427,"Thanks again guys  Mike how about a calendar for all your awesome pics. It would be really cool.  I would first have to photograph fish that are meaningful/relevant to each month.LOL  It wouldn’t make sense to put pictures of me carp fishing in shorts & T-shirts for the month of February.LOL  Don't know your background sir, but if you aren't a professional photographer/videographer you missed your calling. Absolutely amazing images. Thanks for sharing.  For a few years I used to take product photos for Whirlpool/Maytag/Kenmore (of washing machines and dryers). At the beginning, when they said I'd be taking photos of 'models', I was thinking of something very different.LOL"

810247,MJL,2013-10-01 15:22:00,2427,"A few months ago, as sure as the sun will rise, the salmon made their annual return to my local streams. Fed by cold springs, the salmon pushed through despite scorching day time temperatures. I left the fishing gear behind and hiked the creeks with my camera. The water was low but not as clear as I would’ve liked. I mounted my camera onto a net handle and probed the pools to document this great migration.

I found my way through gravel and dirt roads winding through valleys, before going onto sketchy trails ridden with pot-holes and fallen branches.  Alone, I stalked the streams with ghost-like stealth carrying my fly rod and camera gear in hand. I had miles worth of river to wade without another person in sight. At the end of the journey, I eventually found freedom.
