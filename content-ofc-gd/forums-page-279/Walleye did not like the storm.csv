A few showers were forecast....lol....so no surprise when i got to the launch lighting and thunder, torrential rains and near hurricane winds. I waited for an hour and the storm passed. The walleye were there in the hundreds. I could raise them off the bottom....but holy moly...could not get many to commit.  Good way to refresh after a long night shift, but frustrating to watch that many fish on the finder and not get bit!  "
