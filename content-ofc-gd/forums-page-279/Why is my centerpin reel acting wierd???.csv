809859,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-29 03:17:00,10439,You have a little bit of sand/grit in it. Remove the spool and give the spool and backplate a rinse with water.
809860,Richie Razor,2013-09-29 03:17:00,536,What kind of noise is it making? Is it a grinding noise? Most likely it is caused by sand or grit in between the spool and the backplate. Take of the spool and use a cotton swab or an air duster to get rid of and grit that might have been trapped in the reel.  Try not to dunk the reel in the river and you won't have this problem.

809918,BillM,2013-09-29 17:33:00,17367,Probably dirty.  A good dunk in some clean water will fix it right up.
