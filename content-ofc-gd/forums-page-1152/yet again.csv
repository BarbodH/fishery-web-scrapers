He was the first to catch a fish.   He was really rubbing it in until...   This pretty much shut him up,lol. Started getting dark after this so we left.   He has already challenged me for tomorrow so will have another report."

110690,fatherof3,2007-09-06 02:38:00,1769,"I hear ya Tbayboy.I think I have been out everyday since you were down.I was really missing out by not taking a 5 minute walk. Yeah Xrap,I think I made him mad,lol and as far as his smile,it will be when he is holding the bigger fish"
110730,motv8tr,2007-09-06 06:29:00,2587,"While I may not reply to all of them, I do enjoy your posts, it's good to see you getting out with your boys....and ya, it doesn't hurt that you're so close to the water  Maureen"
