The thing with the bass in West Lake is they will be heavy in one spot and the next year they have moved to another, so if your not getting them steady your  in the wrong place. There are a few big smallies if you know where to look for them."
111310,Rizzo,2007-09-08 01:44:00,4754,"great report and photos.  I used to fish east and west lake all the time.  My yearly  trip with the grandparents when I was a wee one we stayed at either Martin's Outlet Park or Log Cabin Point at the mouth of the outlet river.  Both are great lakes, but a good haul from Toronto when the average fish usually aren't too big.  Funny thing is, East lake has even better numbers than west, west tends to have the bigger fish (proximity to the big lake affects that I'm sure)"
111311,Joey,2007-09-08 01:48:00,9122,"Great report Frozen-fire.  Looks like you had a nice time and caught lots of fish.  I'm not a firm believer in the morning bite myself.  I'm not really a morning person, but when I do drag my arse outta bed to fish early, I don't usually catch anything  Good stuff.  Joey"
111349,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-08 04:47:00,835,"Well I'm not to happy with West Lake right now, I whacked that pile of rocks early in the year. The drive started getting noisy  last couple times out so now I got it all apart with a chewed up drive gear and the pieces ruined the bearings.  Water is so low right now the guys are pulling the docks out."
111350,frozen-fire,2007-09-08 04:48:00,542,  Anybody ever try Consecon? It's the lake northwest of West Lake. I've been told the piking is excellent there.
111351,frozen-fire,2007-09-08 04:50:00,542, It's true... the water is unbelievably low right now. I was warned many times by the people staying at the cottage and the owner. Heard last year was worse though.
