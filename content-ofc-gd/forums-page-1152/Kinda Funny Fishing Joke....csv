After an hour, the following conversation took place:  First guy: ""You have no idea what I had to do to be able to come out  fishing this weekend. I had to promise my wife that I would paint every  room in the house next weekend.""  Second guy: ""That's nothing, I had to promise my wife that I would build  her a new deck for the pool.""  Third guy: ""Man, you both have it easy! I had to promise my wife that I  would remodel the kitchen for her.""  They continue to fish. When they realized that the fourth guy has not said a word, they asked him. ""You haven't said anything about what you  had to do to be able to come fishing this weekend. What's the deal?""  Fourth guy: ""I just set my alarm for 5:30 am. When it went off, I shut off my alarm, gave the wife a slap on her butt and said: ""Fishing or Sex?"" and she said: ""Wear sun-block."""
