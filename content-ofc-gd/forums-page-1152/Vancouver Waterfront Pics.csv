Anyways tonite I waited till it got dark and drove across the bridge from Vancouver into North Vancouver.  My goal was to take photos of the Vancouver waterfront.  The hard part was finding a place on the North Van shoreline where I could do this from.  Eventually after dead end upon dead end I found a nice little park.  While I was there I saw some seals playing out in the water and they were headed towards this marina that was attached to the park....it was private though....anyways one day while its light out I'm going to try and sweet talk my way into that marina and photograph some seals.  But enough rambling........heres the photos...  This first one is Canada Place.  I tried a bunch of different shutter speeds and settled on 20 seconds.  I really like how the long exposure time gave every light it's own streak in the water.    And this next one is just a shot of the marina I previously mentioned.    again sorry for this not being fishing/nature related but hopefully you enjoy......thanks for reading  oh and if you feel like it please vote for my photo ""say whaaaaat""...just click on this link.....all votes are greatly appreciated  http://www.picture.com/voteforme/photovote1.asp?PID=2335336"

110813,brandon,2007-09-06 13:44:00,857,just a Canon EOS digital rebel SLR 6.1 megapixel.  I think it's the first digital SLR that Canon came out with.  I bought it used a few months ago and It after it being 4 years old its still workin great.
