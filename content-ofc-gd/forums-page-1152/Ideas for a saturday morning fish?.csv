I guess we could rent a canoe or fish from shore, but they aren't my favourite.  Does anyone have ideas of a place we could get a boat?  I need this to be as close to Kitchener as possible to since we have to be back around 2 in the afternoon.  Thanks! Evan"
111083,Golfisher,2007-09-07 12:56:00,586,Might want to give Belwood Lake a try.  Closer than Island Lake.
111085,evster,2007-09-07 12:57:00,367,"Oh...I should also add...none of the conservations areas in the area (conestoga, belwood, guelph, island) are renting motorized boats anymore."
111087,Golfisher,2007-09-07 13:03:00,586,For good or just for this year?
111090,evster,2007-09-07 13:10:00,367,"Just for the year, i think its because of the low water levels."
111099,ricoboxing,2007-09-07 13:36:00,398,"4get about a boat, go shore fish @ the grand, and get some waders. don't think theres anything other than the cons. areas  near kitchener."
111190,jediangler,2007-09-07 17:17:00,1923,You could try Shades Mill conservation area in Cambridge. Close to Kitchener and they rent canoes. It's also small enough you can fish the whole lake in 4 hrs. The other option might be Valens conservation area. They rent 12' aluminum fishing boats (no motors) as well as canoes and tandem kayaks.
