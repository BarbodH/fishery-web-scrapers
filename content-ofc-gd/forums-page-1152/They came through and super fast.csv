P.S. just incase you did not read my thread before on this they had a problem a few years back when they switched there pins over they had shortened them up to 1 /38"" instead of 1 1/2"" so that is where the problem was I just bought these two rod holders this spring so the old ones are still out there if you buy a new Down-East salty you might want to check the lin length before you use it.  Down-East web site  Here is what they sent thanks again "
