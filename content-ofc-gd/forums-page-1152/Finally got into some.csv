110939,Kerry,2007-09-07 00:29:00,383,Haven't had much time to do any fishing this year so having a couple of early mornings this past weekend was perfect. Sat: &  There were a couple more bass and a huge walleye I lost at boatside on saturday so I figured early sunday morning I'd give it another go. Sun: &  & this guy got the day started  I ended up catching 7 eyes and 4 largemouth and home by 10am.Kept four walleye for the table between the two days.A perfect long weekend.  Kerry
