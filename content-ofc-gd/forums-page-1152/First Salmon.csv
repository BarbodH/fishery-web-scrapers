111400,scuro,2007-09-08 15:25:00,386,Awesome when you do something new with no prior experience and you pull the rabit out of the hat. Good on ya!
111097,Golfisher,2007-09-07 13:31:00,586,"Popped the cherry this past weekend.  My first salmon, and what a feeling!  Threw glow-in-the-dark cleos for nearly four hours, and all that work finally produced.    I noticed pier fishing is somewhat akin to carping--both require a lot of patience and both species put up a great fight--but also very different--one involves sitting around chatting with friends until the alarm goes off, the other, well, you have to chuck that spoon time after time until the arm is about to fall off.  The pier was quite crowded; pretty much anywhere castable had a guy throwing spoons, but it got thinned out around 2 and that's when the fish began to bite.  I hate living in TO, but fish like this makes it a bit more tolerable."

111111,silveradosheriff,2007-09-07 14:12:00,1025,Very nice - congrats!
111112,Joey,2007-09-07 14:13:00,9122,"Well what a treat for your first Salmon, she's a beaut.  Congrats.  Joey"
111121,wuchikubo,2007-09-07 14:35:00,1114,"Congrats on your first Salmon, definitely a nice one to start with.  Stan"
111122,lazybum,2007-09-07 14:37:00,142," Oh Yeah, for sure.  The sudden burst of speed and power from salmon is absolutely incredible.  You do need a good drag on your reel to manage the sudden pulls towards Niagara.  Good work   ."
111124,snag,2007-09-07 14:38:00,1932,Outstanding.  Where did you live before? I was happy to move out of the city but do miss some conveniences.
111127,SlowPoke,2007-09-07 14:45:00,2984,"Well done, a fine speciman indeed! Pier fishing can be a blast when your properly equipped for it... lawn chair, ottoman, shoulder pads, timbits and a BFN. -Brian"
111129,mattyk,2007-09-07 14:50:00,2110,"very nice fish, good work!"
111130,tonyb,2007-09-07 14:58:00,1637,"Sweet!  It's all about the GLOW!  The thing that always amazes me is that you can catch Salmon casting lures at night, but try trolling for them and it's a real challenge to get fish...  Tony"
111132,danbo,2007-09-07 14:58:00,2646,atta boy!
111133,Golfisher,2007-09-07 14:58:00,586,"Used to live in Ottawa and Kingston, both of which are a lot greener and cleaner than TO.  But it could be worse; I could be living in LA!  LOL"
