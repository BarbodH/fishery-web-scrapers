110868,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-06 18:22:00,698, What's the story behind it?
110884,Guest skeeter99,2007-09-06 20:04:00,0,"there is and was a explosives dumping ground in the lake in wellers bay, mostly from the second world war, it is by the what they call the ""beach"" the peninsula land/sandbar that seperates the bay from the lake. I would not worry about fishing and blowing up, it is a very popular area with several campgrounds and trailer parks"
110886,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-06 20:07:00,698," Wow, that a neat story."
