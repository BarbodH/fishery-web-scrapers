106605,lew,2007-08-23 13:38:00,12767,"Thanks again everyone, I awoke this morning still amazed at the generosity and kindness of so many members of this board, both my personal friends and also the many I have never  had the pleasure of meeting.........yet.  I figured I'd show you the original photograph which was taken several years ago on a cheap camera, and then the painting along side of it for comparison.  I've been looking at the painting closely today and find the detail absolutely amazing, and Pam captured Ed exactly as he looked, which goes to show her talent as nothing really shows up that well in the photograph.  You can even see the cooling water discharging from the pee-hole......unbelievable !!  I'll be taking the painting to show my mother today and I know she'll be as moved and impressed as I am myself.    "
106616,dustink,2007-08-23 14:02:00,526,Amazing & Awesome....    Proud to be part of OFC!
106631,RobHall,2007-08-23 14:26:00,261,"Wow!  What an awesome painting.      I was anxiously waiting to see it and the wait was well worth it.   When I received the PM from Joey, I was happy to contribute.  I may have never met you personally Lew, but i feel as if i have known you for some time.  That's one of the great things about this community.  I can't think of a more deserving person.  I look forward to meeting you next year at lakair.  A big thanks goes to Pam for putting one of Lew's favourite pictures of fishing with his brother Eddy to canvas.  You did an awesome job Pam.  Joey...a big    up for you to, for bringing this all together.  A big thanks also goes to all those who contributed.  It's just goes to show once again, how great a community this is.

109246,bpsbassman,2007-08-31 04:03:00,941,"I've been waiting to see this picture for quite some time.  I have said it before, but Pam, your work just keeps on getting better!! Very moving Lew. By the way Lew, once you covered up, is that the same shirt that you were wearing in the picture??  I am flying out to Edmonton on Sunday to join my older brother who drove out west two weeks ago and to take a week and drive home with him.  This is something we've talked about doing for years.  My brother means the same to me as Ed meant to you, and I will be thinking of you and Ed along the way and savour our time together that much more. Be well my friend."
109271,musky_man,2007-08-31 10:14:00,159,"Lew,  What a wonderful keepsake to have.  Like you, my bros is my long-time fishing partner and I can not begin to imagine not having him in the boat each year.  Pam -- great painting ... love your style.  - Mark"
109277,DT10Sam,2007-08-31 12:24:00,480,"You are an amazing individual Lew and I wish I would have met your brother.  Lew you seem to have an effect on everyone on this board that I have never seen displayed anywhere else. You do have abilities of bringing out the good in everyone and whenever you see something that does not really sit well with you you find a gentle manner in which you can be subtle in getting your point across and you also have your notorious smile which is your trademark.  After all Marvin things your an okay guy so that is good enough for me to be in your corner.  To everyone on this board that were involved you leave me speechless........don't know what to say......what a gesture of friendship.  OFNer's are the best.  Kind regards, Sam"
110927,irishfield,2007-09-06 23:10:00,26272,"Looks great Pam and WELL worth the wait for us that knew it was all in motion.  Lew, I'm glad that we, the OFC'rs, (with Joey, Pete and Pam's footwork) could add that glimps of ""yesteryear"" to your home, to bring a smile and/or tear to your eye as you reflect on memories with your best friend. I know what a great feeling it is to share a boat with you for even a day....I'm sure Eddie enjoyed your company as much as you enjoyed his.  Cheers, Wayne"
106489,douG,2007-08-23 03:39:00,2693,"Thanks to JoAnne and Pete, and to Pamela too.  Very fine and true folks here all around.  Best to you, Lew."

106538,aplumma,2007-08-23 10:56:00,6896,Thank you Joanna and Paul for spearheading the effort I knew it was a good idea from the start. Pam as always your talent is great and the uses you put it to are a tribute to your soul.  Lew I know what a powerful force 2 brothers can generate between each other to have a picture that shows that is a rare and precious thing. I am sure that a place of honor will be found and the memories will last for many years to come.   Art
106548,brickNblock,2007-08-23 11:30:00,598,"Talk about..""Under the Wire""..or,..""By a Nose""... My donation was sent in yesterday....sorry for my tardiness Joey.  Lew, Your brothers passing effected all here, for many different reasons, coupled with our affection of You, for all the many, many things you have given of yourself and time, knowledge and experiences shared this was the least friends could do.......Enjoy Lew.  Pam, Ive seen much of your work but this will remain my favourite...wonderful.

106569,John,2007-08-23 12:19:00,2956,"A great tribute for a most deserving man.......  We all have or will experience life at it's very best and it's most challenging times. The support that we receive from OFC's, some whom we know well and others who we have never met, is truly overwhelming. The fact that we share some of the best and worst times of our lives with one another attests to what we actually have here.  Each time you look into the painting Lew, you will discover new intimate details that bring back fond memories. Something that only an artists rendering can provide.  Be well Lew, Diane and Sheri......  John.."
106570,Squid,2007-08-23 12:20:00,1656,"Awesome is all I can say. Great work Pam   . Lew as always, you are a great man and I consider it an honor everytime we share a boat. Joey great work hon on getting this project off the ground. As mentioned, the OFC is a family for sure."

106460,Gerritt,2007-08-23 02:42:00,6129,Looking at the picture now.. I am still moved.   Look at the transom.. an OFC sticker...   Lew.. you are a great guy... and deserving of this... Albeit everyone wishes it was under different circumstances..  But that sticker on your boat is what binds us..  we are all OFC'rs... yes we may not agree with one another 100% of the time... We may not even talk to each other... but we are OFC'rs just the same...  I for one am glad that we have a OFC'r like you on the board... we have exchanged greetings etc.. and while we have not been in a boat together you have let me see a little bit of of your life...  alot of us have been there by your side... weather it be your triumphs or your heart breaking disappointments..   Just always remember...  You have some friends here and it certainly was shown here via your post.  Thank you for bringing me to reality too... I take this place for granted every once and awhile..  I hope you find solace  and a bit of peace my friend... May the fish be world records and the chatter comical..  Gerritt.
