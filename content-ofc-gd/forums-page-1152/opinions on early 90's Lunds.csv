110980,stuntman,2007-09-07 01:43:00,96,"Hey guys, still looking for my first boat.  Misted an alumacraft with motor that sutied me well and a heavy duty crestliner that was too far to travel for.  I have see an early 90's Lund utility boat with a good motor.  Are the older Lunds solid?  I know I have had a few posts on buying a bot here.  I hope is OK to ask this type of stuff here, I know you guys have some knowledge and experience with boats.  thanks,  stuntman"
110998,2 tone z71,2007-09-07 02:27:00,1311,"depends alot on where and what type of water it was used in,the ones up here get alot of pounding in the G bay area and leak early in life,best bet now a days is an all welded aluminum boat,cant beat them,may cost a lil more but will make up for it in the long run"
111000,Sinker,2007-09-07 02:41:00,8692,"I have a 93 aluminum, and no leaks so far. I use it twice a week at least. It takes a beating......I break ice to get in, in the spring, and break ice to get out in the fall. I fish and hunt out of it.  Sinker"
111005,Greencoachdog,2007-09-07 02:55:00,8163,I've heard thru the grapevine that Lunds are for Losers:  Especially the tiller models... avoid them at all costs!!!  All big name consoles are pretty close.. with Tracker being the best!!!  I really like Trackers!  I own a Tracker!  Trackers are the BEST!!!!
111015,Dondorfish,2007-09-07 03:25:00,1000,"  Truer words have not been spoken!  And yes, I own a Tracker also - and love it!   Don"
111264,stuntman,2007-09-07 21:19:00,96,"oh no a boat war....as long as a boat is solid, I dont care much.....there are a few models I am keeping my eyes open for.  stuntman"
111268,Mike the Pike,2007-09-07 21:35:00,3421, Glen are you trying to open a can of worms again its bad enough you can't find shiner minnows.Come to think of it you could save alot of time driving by calling all those bait shops before setting out.Trackers are for guys who make tracks all over hells achres looking for shiners  Tiller is the best way to catch a wall-ice.The Walleye in you avatar was caught in a tiller boat EH Glen  By By Glen
111271,Mike the Pike,2007-09-07 22:00:00,3421, Ya its too bad Don the wife wants you to get rid of it to make room for the new boat.
111273,Dondorfish,2007-09-07 22:04:00,1000,   LOL - MTP  -  ain't gone yet!!!!   You see any adds from me selling my Tracker? Told her the best time to sell would be the spring!!   Don    
111294,Greencoachdog,2007-09-07 23:41:00,8163," HA! I knew that would get a rise out of you Mike!  Don't forget, I live in Alabanana Mike... we're only allowed 1 telephone per 5 mile radius ( that's like 3000 Canadian kilometers... no wonder y'all think your country is so big!)  The only reason that Wall-ice in my avatar bit is because i took the steering column out of the rental car and mounted it in the cedar strip so the fish would think it was a console!!!   BTW... I got me a little cast net today, and I'll proly snatch this $8K worth of dental work out of my head the first time I throw it... but I'm gonna try to get me some Shad so's I aint gotta search all over hell and half of Georgia to find the Shiney Minners!"
111322,Mike the Pike,2007-09-08 02:29:00,3421,I knew the tiller sheet was for me Dog you knew I coudn't resist  So dog are you coming to Quinte or what?  You could have a chance at changing the wall-ice in your Avatar.   Oh and thanks for the laughs as usual  MTP
111394,douG,2007-09-08 14:36:00,2693,"Glen,  your transport from the airport to the BoQ is on standby, awaiting scheduling info."
111419,specktacklure,2007-09-08 18:10:00,56,Be hard pressed to find a used Lund from the 80's.Early 90's changed a bit but still best aluminum on the market.Definitely better than a Tracker !!!
