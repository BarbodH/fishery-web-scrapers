111208,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-07 18:02:00,835,This might be a good time to ask.  I want to get this into the power squadrons boating coarse.
111209,jedimaster,2007-09-07 18:03:00,3472,Do yu ean take two canoes and make a raft out of them?
111215,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 18:24:00,698,Have one boat paddle up to the leader and hold on to his boat. The next paddler paddles over and holds onto the canoes already in rafting position until everyone is together. This creates a stable based for giving and recieving instructions.
111219,ccmtcanada,2007-09-07 18:28:00,7971,Oh...I thought it was a fishing technique to make your canoe more stable...LOL
111248,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-07 20:37:00,835,No I want to know how to rope them together for crossing rough water. Tied together you get the stability of a multi hull.
111254,jedimaster,2007-09-07 20:56:00,3472,"You kinda have to see it to get it. but you need to get an extra set of paddles. put a paddle across the bow of two and the stern of two, wedge a lifejacket between the middle where they touch and tie off the front paddles on the outside of the front and back and tie the middle together on the inside. I did this a few times on Opeongo when it got whicked wavy and it worked well."
111255,jedimaster,2007-09-07 20:57:00,3472,If you have 4 canoes you can make them into a diamond this also works well.
111346,Sinker,2007-09-08 03:40:00,8692,"We have rafted 4 canoes  together and put up a tarp and sailed back to the launch.  4 canoes lashed together is a pretty stable craft. Put up that tarp, and you can really fly"
