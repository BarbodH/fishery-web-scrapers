111143,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 15:26:00,698,There's a discussion in this thread about them  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry111128  Seems to have a great reputation from the guys here. I'm going to be ordering a spinnerbait kit from them
111144,TJQ,2007-09-07 15:27:00,7806,Ive orerded a ton of stuff from them.. great service great products!
111149,Roy,2007-09-07 15:35:00,13728,"Very friendly folks at luremaking.com. I order from them and have never ever had a problem. They are fast, efficient and really know there stuff. As far as junk is concerned, I think you'll have to go elsewhere for that cause I'm sure they don't have any in stock."
111151,Terry,2007-09-07 15:37:00,14456,I have been ordering for them for years and they are great
111155,Dano,2007-09-07 15:53:00,719,No complaints here either.
111162,jedimaster,2007-09-07 16:15:00,3472,On the same topic how difficult is it to put together the spinner baits if you buy the kit? I was thinking of buying a kit.
111202,Fishn Technishn,2007-09-07 17:46:00,198,"TOP NOTCH! If you look on their site the even have instructions. The Musky size stuff is great & has never let me down. Although my PB is only 44""-30LBS. Give yhem a try & you won't go elsewhere, in my opinion.  FT"
111218,Terry,2007-09-07 18:28:00,14456,"I don't like ""kits"" if you are going to put together your own lures..I like to buy the different components and custom make the lures the way I want ...but... if it's the first time you are going to do it, it is a good way to get your feet wet"
