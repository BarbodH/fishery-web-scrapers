110675,evster,2007-09-06 02:00:00,367,"Just wondering if anyone touches up the paint on weights, and what you use?  I just have a lot of spinner baits, jigs and just plain slip sinkers that have been dinged off rocks and logs and all the paint has chipped off.  They can still catch fish, but I like having nice looking lures   .  Any tips?"
110875,addict,2007-09-06 19:13:00,475,sometimes i steal my ol ladies nail polish to touch up baits
110880,Roy,2007-09-06 19:45:00,13728,The powder paints do the best job. You can get them from  luremaking.com.
110883,Handlebarz,2007-09-06 19:58:00,3790,I get funny looks when I am buying nail polish also.  But 99% of the time I use powder paint it is awsome and easy after you bake it you can bounce it off alot of rocks it will last over any other. And Luremaking.com is very fast shipping and good people give them a call and ask as many questions as you have they will answer them all.
