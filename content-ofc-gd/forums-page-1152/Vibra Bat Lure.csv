110667,Gerritt,2007-09-06 01:21:00,6129,  Maybe you need to be fishing the ol' Ceeement pond! LOL  Gerritt.
110722,OhioFisherman,2007-09-06 04:55:00,6623,"LOL ya I had one, same success with it as Rick."
110723,danbo,2007-09-06 05:00:00,2646,"How about the old ""Blood Lure"" that came with a vial of powdered blood to pour into the clear/hollow minnow?"
110745,Fishn Technishn,2007-09-06 08:53:00,198,i still have one of those!!I don't dare use as I don't think you can buy the blood powder anymore. Also have a Popeil Pocket Fisherman in the bag with instructions!
110847,hawkeye,2007-09-06 16:33:00,162,same results as Rick too
110890,jedimaster,2007-09-06 20:17:00,3472,I used to have a spoon the shape of a pair of boobies. (.Y.)
110937,Clampet,2007-09-07 00:25:00,1947, Ahh yes..  
111019,Fishn Technishn,2007-09-07 03:45:00,198,I got  a unique one for my Birthday a few years ago. Literature went on how the biggest fish of most species was the female & this lure targeted females...yup it was  COCKSHURE LURE and you can imagine what it looked like!! It has been good for a few laughs!  Ft
111118,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 14:30:00,698,  Looks more like a butt to me
111123,brandon,2007-09-07 14:37:00,857,well no wonder you guys aren't catching fish with it........its clearly made to lure bats not fish
