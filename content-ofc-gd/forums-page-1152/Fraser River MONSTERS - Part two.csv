111167,Tacklebuster,2007-09-07 16:27:00,303,WOW!  What a trip!  The kind of fishing adventure that you only see on TV.  Definately gets my vote for best report of the year.
111172,Dano,2007-09-07 16:36:00,719,"Very cool stuff scuro!!! Those breaching shots are awesome, thanks for sharing your excellent report!"
111178,myst,2007-09-07 16:49:00,57,Simply unbelievable. I've wanted to do something like this all of my life.
111247,Ladyfish,2007-09-07 20:37:00,2,Poor Dean.    Thank heavens for him that afternoon.  That was when the brute was going out and down for the millionth time and I was really debating what the heck I was doing here.   He was making sure that I didn't follow it out of the boat    And kept me motivated right after when I saw that the shore was no where close
110376,scuro,2007-09-05 03:06:00,386,A good section of part two was told to me second hand and in parts I took the liberty to fill in the dots to make a better story. I hope that I got it right in the spirit of what happened and also in the details.
110379,tbayboy,2007-09-05 03:14:00,1497,"Damn, I didn't think you could out do the first part but those breaching shots are just amazing.  I thought seeing a muskie jump was something but thats just incredible.  Trip of a lifetime in my books for sure.  Thanks for all the wonderful details."
110383,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-05 03:25:00,698,Wow....Just Wow!

110653,Ladyfish,2007-09-06 00:32:00,2,Excellent post Chris!  Definitely was a pleasure to fish with you.   Thanks for all the help with the bar fishing............ Still say that rod was taller than me along with that being my first time using such a reel.   And yes I admit I was still very stiff from the other day.  I think the bruising is finally starting to lighten up..   But with all that said I have never felt the rush I had when I was tangling with that bruiser!  Dean was a help making sure I stayed inside the boat when it decided to peel out for the millionth time and the other major part.... BREATHE!!!  I was on pins and needles on the way back to the lodge after our day out at the Pitt while you guys were out fighting the sturgeon.  I wanted you all to have the fun of tangling with one that size............but in the back of my mind I was also hoping to beat you guys with the biggest  Hopefully there will another chance to head back when all the species will be open and better opportunity.  Thanks again
110657,Joey,2007-09-06 00:42:00,9122,"Now that was worth the wait, excellent report.  Beauty fish for all, wooohooooo   Joey"
110658,Cast-Away,2007-09-06 00:42:00,790,"Wow, the trip of a lifetime for sure!"
110662,fishindevil,2007-09-06 01:10:00,6254,SIMPLY INCREDIBLE !!!!!!!!   great report & pics of those HUGE FRASER RIVER STURGEON .  ...trip of a lifetime....cheers
110684,scuro,2007-09-06 02:31:00,386,"  I guess you can literally call your fish a bruiser . I know what you mean about getting a rush and for me it was sometimes even before I was fighting the fish. When my turn was up my adrenaline would sometimes start pumping when the rod started bouncing. Sometimes there would be no Sturgeon and it would be a  squaw fish or the lead rolling but my heart was in my mouth often anticipating what could possibly come. I can only equate fishing sturgeon to getting into a fight. One moment things are normal in the world and the next moment you are in a physical drag down fight in which your heart is racing and you can feel the blood pumping in your head.  Good on ya that you caught the biggest one, I can only imagine what that would have been like. I never saw a fish caught larger then 6 ft. We briefly talked about the possibility of being beat by a girl before we went fishing on that last day. It was funny, first someone said that would suck but then someone piped in that you earned it and we all got contemplativly silent and then agreed in reverent tones. When you can get a group of guys to be quiet and think about your fish you have really accomplished something.  ""Getting lifted off of your feet""...I heard about that from Dean and was hesitant to put it in the story because it didn't really sound plausible. Yet after looking at Simon's series of pics of the battle more closely tonight I see that your hat has come off and that both Dean and the guide are hovering around you. This pic looks like a romantic snapshot of a couple looking out on the water. You are wedged in-between Dean's legs and he has his arms around you. Really what he is doing is anchoring you to the boat! Tell me more, I didn't hear this part of the story! "
110876,addict,2007-09-06 19:16:00,475,im more than a little jealous sweet trip man.

110911,wuchikubo,2007-09-06 21:40:00,1114,"Awesome Part 2!  Welcome to the OFC Diane. You've set the bar high.  I must agree, that sounded like an amazing trip. I definitely thank Scuro (Chris) for such a great post. Now to finishing dreaming and get back to reality for me. LOL  Stan"
