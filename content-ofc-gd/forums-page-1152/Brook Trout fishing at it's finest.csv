110330,huntervasili,2007-09-05 00:46:00,1604,Looks like an awesome time out there and some really good looking pictures too.. Thanks for sharing
110334,danc,2007-09-05 00:51:00,4677,"I didn't expect to see this report so soon Ron. But I'm glad that it's up. I didn't get to see a lot of your fish when they were caught, but the photos are almost just as good. The videos are awesome as well. The people viewing the videos have no idea how much current that you are running your boat in. And you sure know your way through there too. There's a few obstacles to avoid. It was great seeing you and Keith once again Ron. Sis and I enjoyed it immensely. Let's do it again some time."
