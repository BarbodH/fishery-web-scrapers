111267,camillj,2007-09-07 21:33:00,1988,My (almost) instant cure for most types of sore throats is a good old fashioned salt gargle (mix 2 tablespoons of table salt in hot tap water - about half a glass) and gargle until its gone .. dont swallow as it WILL make you barf ... anyhow most sore throats will subside very quickly (if not immediately) ... the sickness will not be cured but the throat will stop getting more and more inflamed .... I find in flu/colds it moves from what would normally be a day or two of sore throat straight on to the next stages of the cold ... nice thing about it is that it doesnt interfere with your 'other' medications ...   Anyhow as many have said .. best to go see your doctor about it especially if it persists ....

If you see pus and spots at the back, no gargling or garlic or chicken soup is gonna help.  You need a doctor and antibiotics.  If you are snotting straw coloured or green goo outa yer shnozz, you have a sinus infection.  You need a doctor and antibiotics.  Call the TeleHealthLine  to talk to a registered nurse 24/7.  It's free.  Or at least available at no additional cost.  No good reason to take any advice  from a fishing board other than the above.  Please, it's a sore throat.  Soaring is what birds do."

111261,wuchikubo,2007-09-07 21:12:00,1114," Now that is an impressive list of items, two of which stands out to be to be a bit stretched.  Ear infections and Ebola. Ear infections I know very well of since I'm in the hearing industry, that said, I know of another item that claims about the same amount of effectiveness with the same range but I've personally tried it and has not lived up to it's claims. It may very well depend on the type of infection but that's a broad sweeping statement above.  Ebola , well that's an untreatable virus as I recalled but maybe that changed so I googled it and found:  ""... Because Ebola is potentially lethal and since no approved vaccine or treatment is available, Ebola is classified as a biosafety level 4 agent, as well as a Category A bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""  Now if they had HIV and cancer in the list, I'd know it would have be too far fetched but I don't know, it may be worth a look.  Be cautious of wild claims.  HF"
