111160,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-07 16:05:00,0,What can I say other than that I would recommend any one who would ever consider a Musky trip that they try it at least once in their life. I'm going back GUARANTEED!!!! Great set up! Well taken care of. The fish co operated and both me and my buddy caught fish. Was a trip to put in the books that's for sure. I learned more in 2 days than I have in 35 years fishing on the bay. There are differences but what I learned will DEFINITELY put more fish in my boat this season. Out tomorrow to try new found knowledge. I had a blast as did my buddy who has never caught a Musky or thought much about Musky fishing in general......... He's sold!  Thanks Marc !!!!!  Was a pleasure....Your new 08 calendar is in the mail with dates marked down on it ..ha ha  ...
