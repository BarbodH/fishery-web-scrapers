If you are planning to come north this weekend there are some fish in at Southamton, not many but if you walk the river and fish only the good water you will find them.  I would like to go tomorrow, I have a personal pontoon boat and I'm planning to drift the river tomorrow morning.  If anyone is interested let me know.  Tight Lines....."
