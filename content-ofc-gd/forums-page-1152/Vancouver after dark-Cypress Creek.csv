110395,brandon,2007-09-05 06:12:00,857,Today after work I headed back to Cypress Creek to take some photos of the same area I was in before but from a few different angles this time.  A few turned out alright but it was such low light that my auto focus wouldn't pick up anything so most of the pictures weren't as sharp as they should have been because the focus was manual and again in low light.        I also stopped at Cypress Provincial Park on the way home and parked a lookout and waited for the sun to go down....   This is the Lions Gate Bridge leading from Stanley Park to West Vancouver.  Ambleside beach is in the foreground with Downtown Vancouver in the background.   And this is the Lions Gate Bridge again as it leads into Stanley Park with the Vancouver Downtown/Waterfront in the background

110572,addy79,2007-09-05 19:23:00,573,how do you get the water to turn out like that?? shutter speed??
110655,brandon,2007-09-06 00:34:00,857,Yeah I slowed the shutter speed way down for those.  It was dusk so I dropped it down to 6 seconds.  The night Shots are also with a slower speed anywhere from 3-6 seconds.
