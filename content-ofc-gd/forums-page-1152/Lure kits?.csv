110891,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-06 20:19:00,698,"Hi All, I'm looking to build up my lure repertoire and was thinking of grabbing a couple of kits from Basspro (31 piece jig kits, 16 piece spinnerbait and trailer and 5 piece crankbait kit). My question is are these pre-built kits worth the money or are they just junk that they try to sell by packaging them together?"
110895,tonyb,2007-09-06 20:29:00,1637,"I'll go out on a limb, since I'm not sure who makes the kits, and say they are junk.  You're better off selecting lures and gear targeted towards the species you intend to fish for, rather than miscellaneous kits.  Tony"

110902,Pike_Nut71,2007-09-06 21:21:00,18,"I agree with tonyb, I think the kits are junk. Best bet is read up on what is working and try it out. But don't be aftraid to mix it up. As you can see for yourself on several post here, trolling for lakers and nail a bass, going for pike and come up with cats...  Fish are werid some times..."
110908,mistaredone,2007-09-06 21:33:00,913,"Its always nice to have a selection but I prefer to do the shopping myself.  Once you find a good bait reach for the back of the shelf and pull.  Meps 3 long works in green, orange and yellow works the best on my lake and I clear the shelf every time I hit the store."
110916,aplumma,2007-09-06 21:58:00,6896,Look at the kits and decide which parts of it are really useful to you and check the prices of the components you want. Add them up and subtract from it the cost of the units you will never use.Some companies offer good discounts on bulk purchases if it can save a buck on packaging.   Art

110991,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 02:12:00,698,Thanks for the advice and for saving me money! Not sure if I'm ready to make my own lures yet but I'd sure like to give it a try.
111017,Fishn Technishn,2007-09-07 03:42:00,198,I will second the Luremaking.com suggestion. They have some amazing hardware/blanks etc. Check out their site  FT
111106,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-07 13:52:00,0,"Another vote for luremaking.com.  Great people to deal with and you get your order very fast.  Made a ton of muskie baits last winter, lots of fun, it does save you money, but I do it more for something to do during the winter when I'm not icefishing.  Good luck"
111115,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 14:16:00,698, There seems to be a consensus on making your own lures. Would it be too difficult for someone like me who is a relative newbie or would I be able to pick it up easily?
111126,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-07 14:40:00,0," It's just like anything else, practise makes perfect.  I found that I learned something different each time I would make one.  I primarily made spinnerbaits and bucktails.  (Mistytails   )  I initially was using bucktail and then started using marabou as well.  Marabou is alot easier to work with.  I just use my workbench in my house and got a flytying vice and bought different parts as needed.  I actually go to different stores and look at the baits to get ideas, also I use previous experiences in what colors have worked for me before. My father-in-law was even getting rid of a stuffed pheasant he had had for years so I grabbed him to use his feathers in some of the bucktails.  Anyways I suggest giving it a try, I'm not sure what type of fish you are after but I found it to be very enjoyable.  Here's a few I made last winter...       There's quite a few guys on this board that make their own stuff.  I picked up some great pointers from Teamemptypockets (Jef), and recently JP."
111128,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-07 14:48:00,698,  Those are really cool. I might pick up a spinnerbait kit (Love spinnerbaits) and give er a go. The good thing is it's not that expensive so if I screw it up it's not a big deal
111235,Uncle Buck,2007-09-07 19:46:00,1000,"making crankbaits is much more involved...  you never need to tune a spinner...  as for crankbaits, you have to water tune them to perfection..  make sure they land/float/swim belly up, also that they track straight etc...  there are some fine looking baits there Jim!!"
