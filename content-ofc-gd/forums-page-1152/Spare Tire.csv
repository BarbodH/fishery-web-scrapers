111174,Gerritt,2007-09-07 16:40:00,6129,My Trailer has 5.30x12 - 5bolt wheels.... I can pick up a spare tire assembly from BPS for about $90.00...  but would a 4.80x12 - 5bolt work as a replacement?? as they are on sale @ princess auto...  I assume the first number is the tire width??  also are the centre hub sizes standard?  Thanks in advance!  Gerritt.
111187,Whopper,2007-09-07 17:08:00,2174,"Gerritt the first letter is correct and yes the 5 bolt pattern should be standard. IMHO and this is from experience, if you are going to trailer your boat a lot buy quality tires not the cheapest ones you can buy. I'm not saying the one at BPS is the best because it's $90.00 you have to make sure of the number or plys and the load rating. Keep properly inflated. Bigger the better in my book. My boat is a lot heavier than yours and I run Good Year Marathon steel belted radials and after years of using Carlilse's I'll never go back if I can help it. Trailer maintenance is critical if you don't want to have any problems. Hope this helped  Whopper"

111220,Whopper,2007-09-07 18:35:00,2174,"Sorry     Gerritt I forgot that you asked about a spare, Terry's info is correct but I still stand behind what I stated about trailer tires in general."

111277,Gerritt,2007-09-07 22:19:00,6129,thanks guys.. I headed over to BPS as I am slowly stocking up on stuff for Quinte.. I picked up the proper tire 5.30x12 for 95.00...it is a better tire then the princess auto one as it is 6 ply vs. 4  As for what I picked up @ BPS I grabbed a Shimano TDR and a couple of Manns Stretch 20's  5 minutes to spend a 175.00 god help me having BPS so close...  Gerritt.

111285,fishindevil,2007-09-07 23:03:00,6254,"Right on gerritt,good thinking on that spare....what colors of manns stretch 20's did you get i will pm you there is a few you must have...as well as 1 color of reef runner...it will put fish in your boat....cheers"
