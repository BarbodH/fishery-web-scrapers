323056,Leecher,2009-03-28 01:15:00,7832, Glen it's for Windows XP.... New version free for download off the net!!
323057,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-28 01:19:00,10439,I did some testing when it was in beta and it had some issues then. I see they are now in RC1 so I guess I'll have to try it out again.
323071,bigfish1965,2009-03-28 01:56:00,3382,Its supposed to even be W3C compliant !! Hmm...we need a fainting emoticon. As long as it is still tied into the ActiveX I won't touch it unless I have to.
