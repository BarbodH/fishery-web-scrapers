322555,hammercarp,2009-03-27 00:26:00,964,Snakehead- non native but they are breeding in the states. Guys fish for them like bass. Supposed to be real tackle busters.

322665,timmeh,2009-03-27 04:02:00,609, That article you're referring to was very interesting. I had no idea that species such as peacock bass have established sustaining populations in Florida. And those clown knifefish look like a wild battle.
322920,waterwolf,2009-03-27 20:03:00,556,"had an african snakehead for a couple of years. extremely aggressive fish. fun to watch at feeding time.  he was getting close to 30 in. long and pretty thick.  i walked past the tank one day and for no reason , he  went wild. the 90 gallon tank was shattered by his head {nice gash} ,,water everywhere . what a mess.  got a net and fished him out of the broken tank but he chewed thru that on the way to the bathtub.  now i'm  trying to grab this thing with bare hands . finally got it into my biggest cooler and took it to big al's aquarium .  they offered me some other things on trade .. i declined ,, i was just happy it was over.  you can't purchase them in ontario anymore ,, by law ,, they are banned."
