323030,irishfield,2009-03-28 00:31:00,26272,  You can't be serious Marc! Are you saying you lied when you told Dano and I how great those childhood feeds of Muskie were????
323036,Lunker777,2009-03-28 00:41:00,866,"So I guess I'm not the only one ! hahah I get it from people all the time .... "" you don't eat fish... but you fish ??? "" they say it as though the world is going to come to an end hahah I just tell them I sport fish, I don't fish to eat !  If I go out with friends that keep fish, As long as we are fishing for perch or pickerel .... Ill keep a couple for them. But I NEVER will keep a bass, muskie, pike... etc. I put those ones back to gain a few inches or pounds for the coming years"
323048,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-28 00:54:00,0,"  How could ya resist them nice, white, sweet, flakey meat chunks......"
323063,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-28 01:38:00,10439,When I'm guiding I eat fish 6 days a week. When I'm not guiding just once or twice a week. There is nothing better than some good fish to eat.
323068,crappieperchhunter,2009-03-28 01:46:00,2582,Same at our house! Except for sushi...gotta buy that.
323070,maybe,2009-03-28 01:55:00,307,"Can't stand the texture of fish.  However, the batter from Jeff's fish & chips magically appears on my fork when he's not looking.  I swear I have no idea how it gets there."
323136,Marc Thorpe,2009-03-28 08:41:00,621, ya but wayne look what it did to me  He who eats muskies wakes up being snarly
323163,Radnine,2009-03-28 12:27:00,1538,"I never was a big fish eater of any kind, and I too had a bad experience with gagging on fish bones. Hanging with my B-in-Laws though has got me hooked on eating perch and walleye. What I am not good at yet is cleaning them (only due to lack of practise). I am watching them closely when they clean and when I get some confidence will take knife in hand. First Walleye trip is at the end of May and I can't wait Jim"
323173,lew,2009-03-28 12:41:00,12766,"It's funny cause I really enjoy eating fish, specially a shore lunch, but I just don't have the heart to kill anything, so I seldom have any. I don't mind going out and doing all the catching, and as long as someone else does the killing I can totally pig out on fresh caught & fried pickeral.  hmmmm, now that were on the subject, how many days left before Tombstone Rock in June ??"
323179,Handlebarz,2009-03-28 12:54:00,3790,  WOW them must be some HUGE crappie and pan fish if there biting when your musky fishing I guess you dont need to keep may for the pan then.   I am also one who does not eat fish and I love it when everyone has there own style of fish that I will love. I think its the texture more then the taste I do give it a fair try each time and yes in most cases the batter is great but I just cant bring myself to get past the texture of the fish.  One thing when your out on fishing trips you dont have to fight over the fire for cooking a steak when the fish fry is on.
323185,Greencoachdog,2009-03-28 13:18:00,8163,"Those that don't eat fishe just leave more for those of us that do!!!  I learned when I was an itty bitty young'un to chew my fish carefully before I swallowed it to check for bones! If you know a fishes anatomy, you can eat whole cooked fish without fear of bones!  I freeze my fish in the ""Vac-Loc storage system, keeps them fresk with no freezer burn for up to a year."
323195,bigugli,2009-03-28 14:12:00,6138," I  think the longest my fillets have been in the freezer might be 6 months. They go into a big wicked pot of Gramma's  ""Fish head soup"" if they're that old."
323218,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-28 15:13:00,260, Yeah and for whatever reason it is only when we are out for dinner and not what I have caught and kept  She does eat calamari and scallops  I usually keep some nice eater sized walleye and crappie.  Mnnnnn.
322909,Lunker777,2009-03-27 19:35:00,866,"Just curious to see who here doesn't eat the fish they catch ??  I know of a couple anglers that won't eat fish ! Im one of those people. I had a bad experience when I was a youngster ( choked on a bone ) and to this day I CAN'T bring myself to eat fish.  Ive forced myself to try it pretty well every year and I can only handle a piece or two and then I have to say no more ! Its funny when you here people say "" Well you haven't tried it how I cook it ! "" Each time Ive tried it ""their"" way, I still can't handle it !  I don't look at it as a bad thing though... I just ALWAYS practice catch and release I guess !!! hahah    Have a good day !"
322918,xeon,2009-03-27 19:58:00,350,Hopefully you dont have the same problem if you hunt  .
322921,blaque,2009-03-27 20:03:00,2419,"I eat my catch once a year........literally, thats it. I do a spring trip once a year (walleye) and its the one week i will keep a bunch of fish for my belly. (if things go well that is lol) I duno, i enjoy it, but i just dont do it, too much work i guess. lol"
322922,Terry,2009-03-27 20:07:00,14456,"I eat 2 maybe 3 meals of fish a year  ..cause that's all I can catch..shut up Lloyd, I beat you to it...LOL  no really not a big fish eater, but I do keep a few more fish because my wife like fish"
322923,jediangler,2009-03-27 20:07:00,1923,"I'm with Blaque, once a year when we have our boy's weekend musky trip, we fry up a few crappie, perch and bluegill for lunch."

322926,Joeytier,2009-03-27 20:23:00,3990,"I eat fish with regularity, but I'd say 90% (at the very least) of what I catch is released.  I do really, really love fresh fish, though."
322937,ColdH20guy,2009-03-27 20:43:00,312,"We love it! walleye and bass are awesome..would eat it 2-3 times a week if I could...crappie as well!  I'm not sure who likes it more, me or my wife!"
322941,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-27 20:51:00,0,i'll keep a walleye for table fare but i'm not huge on the salmon and trout.  the odd one that is hooked poorly is kept for my grandmother but the rest go back.  whitefish are also quite tasty.
322942,Fishnwire,2009-03-27 20:55:00,983,"I keep fish to eat about 3-8 times a year.  About half the time it's because the fish appears wounded and live release is entirely unlikely.  The rest of the time it's because I have company at camp and they want a fish fry.  Maybe around 2% of my catch ends up on the table.  I only keep fish if I plan on eating it within a day.  I NEVER, EVER, EVER take fish home just to put in my freezer.  Some people can't seem to tell the difference between fresh and frozen fish, so if they want to keep fish to freeze...that's fine for them.  Like a lot of people though, I sure as heck CAN tell the difference (regardless of how it's packed) and wouldn't waste a fish or a fillet by letting it spend so much as a couple of hours in the deep freeze.  Just like in an army mess hall, anglers should keep in mind that they are free to take all they want (within legal limits of course)...but better be darn sure to eat all they take.  If you've ever cleaned out your freezer and discovered forgotten fillets that are now ruined...remember them the next time you're debating whether or not to harvest a landed fish.  I had a bunch of laker bones stuck in the back of my throat when I was about 7.  My Dad plucked them out with a set of needle nose pliers while I was blindfolded to surpress my gag reflex.  I still eat fish...but it HAS to be totally boneless.  If I'm chewing a piece of fish and detect a bone, I immediatley spit out the entire mouthful."
322963,rapala14,2009-03-27 21:51:00,44,I find i only keep fish when i'm ice fishing.  something about freezin my ass off for hours makes me think i deserve a nice fresh caught fish dinner when i get home.  But in the summer i only keep fish if they're mortally wounded or if a buddy wants a few for home.
322964,Maverick,2009-03-27 21:51:00,371,"I love to eat fish, fresh is preferred but I'll throw some in the freezer without hesitation. If I lived closer to where I fish I might not have much in the freezer but when you are limited to your time on the water, I'll take frozen fish that I caught over captain highliner any day. Also, if I don't end up getting enough for a feed I'll throw them in the freezer and add them to the fish I get the next trip and have a good feed. I also love wild meat and most types of game, in fact I'm having deer chops tonight, can't keep them fresh lol."
322966,OhioFisherman,2009-03-27 21:54:00,6623,"Enough fish dinners for me as a kid, I will eat fish but don`t care to. Usually a  diet thing for me , sardines, tuna, salmon out of a can. Usually kept one fish a year, decent sized walleye, steelhead for the wife and kids."

Call me finicky but I still won't change my mind over it....  The species targeted is walleyes, barbotte (catfish) and brookies.... this year got my first white fish and truly enjoyed it.   I release the fish that I catch all the time except for the bleeders and those that won't make it.  My wife won't eat them but my daughter does and makes for a real enjoyable moment. Leechman"

322980,SlowPoke,2009-03-27 22:28:00,2984,"I've always said ""I don't eat anything that swims or flies"" to which the usual reply is ""You don't like chicken?"". Perhaps I don't hang with a bright crowd. I've tried many species of fish from out of the can, out of the deepfryer to out of the livewell. I just don't have a taste for it to enjoy a meal. I don't have a taste for much out of the ordinary but I will say I loved the deer sausage Pete and Bill forced upon me at Lakair last year. I'm usually willing to try new things. -Brian"
322986,2 tone z71,2009-03-27 22:44:00,1311,"I like to have a few walleye @ pike dinners a summer other than yet back in the lake they go ,sept for them 45 inch plus muskies mmmmm mmmm they dammm good smoked"
322990,Dnthmn,2009-03-27 23:06:00,128,Thanks to Dad we regularly had fresh caught fish and game on the table for our dinner while growing up. In the fall the freezer always got stocked with walleye and perch for the winter months as well. In the water that morning and on the plate that evening is always preferred but thanks to the old man I start feeling like I'm missing out if I don't eat fish I caught about once a week.
322994,ColdH20guy,2009-03-27 23:10:00,312,"speaking of freezing fish,,,do you guys freeze them in  a zip lock bag & suspended in water? thx"
322996,bigugli,2009-03-27 23:19:00,6138,"I too, know only too well the experience of having bones caught in the throat. Ended up in the hospital to have them removed some 30 years back. That scope was the most horrible experience. Everytime I get the feel of fish bones in the mouth, that old gag reflex starts to kick in.  Despite that, I love fish. Got to have it twice a week or so, and I am perty finicky about my fillets. Offspring love it as well, but not the Mrs."
323002,irishfield,2009-03-27 23:42:00,26272, Add water to submerge and squeeze all air out by rolling the zip lock. Stops freezer burn.
