323010,pigeonfisher,2009-03-27 23:58:00,696,Brian...You are eager aren't you.  I was considering buying a new Chrysler but think I am going to wait until the fall to make a decision on a vehicle.  Want to make sure that the businesses are around.  Great deals to be had right now though.  I wish I knew I was having another kid when I bought my accord in August!
323021,misfish,2009-03-28 00:10:00,29133," Steve, I dont see much happening for awhile.Myself, I will be looking at a new truck this June.Dirt cheap from what I have been hearing ,and the gas will always be up and down.  So hows the work outs going bud?  Been swimming all week.Great workout.Up at 5 am and swim from 6 til 7."
323032,pigeonfisher,2009-03-28 00:32:00,696,"I have had a pretty good week, Brian.  I was travelling this week so it was harder to watch the food.  Tomorow should be a good one.  I will start swimming soon."
323034,LeXXington,2009-03-28 00:37:00,1928,"Told a long time ago, If I wanted your opinion I would give it too you.  ~Quote dad."
323128,Zebco,2009-03-28 05:00:00,123,You 2 guys into that fancy Syncronized swimming thing?
323269,POLLIWOGG,2009-03-28 17:55:00,835,I might be able to get a picture of a dock covered with smallies that should get er locked up.
322564,Radnine,2009-03-27 00:45:00,1538,Is it my imagination or have there been a lot of locked threads as of late? Jim
322567,irishfield,2009-03-27 00:47:00,26272,Less than most springs Jim!
322570,bigfish1965,2009-03-27 00:50:00,3382,Just the time of year. Normal stuff. We have extra staff on hand for it...lol.
322572,Terry,2009-03-27 00:52:00,14456,but none are my fault   I'm slipping
322578,kickingfrog,2009-03-27 00:55:00,8333,Even better... the threads that just... disappear
322584,e-z-out,2009-03-27 00:59:00,1052,Yes Terry your slipping bud
322589,danbouck,2009-03-27 01:04:00,4380,How can we get this one locked? I've got a few ideas but I better not!
322609,kemper,2009-03-27 01:43:00,2232,theres at least one more lock up brewing as we speak
322615,Pigeontroller,2009-03-27 01:57:00,2793,"Jim, I can't believe you're holding that poor Bass vertically in your avatar pic!!! You obviously have no regard for the poor thing!!!"
322641,GBW,2009-03-27 03:11:00,8460,but just look at AILE GOBY as he has been lit on fire!
322648,Sinker,2009-03-27 03:24:00,8692,Ha......just wait until next week!!!

322679,Fishnwire,2009-03-27 10:17:00,983,"I find it really funny when the original poster has something along the lines of ""in my opinion, anyway"" right in the sub-heading of the thread...but people still feel the need to jump all over and personally attack the guy, as though he doesn't have the right to a different opinion."
322690,Billy Bob,2009-03-27 11:15:00,5865,The way things are going pretty soon you will be allowed a opinion.
322694,Roy,2009-03-27 11:22:00,13728,"Sorry guys, we're doing the best we can."
322704,steverowbotham,2009-03-27 11:48:00,1800, when certain posters make assumptions that all fish in pictures are slaughtered ... people react
322708,Spiel,2009-03-27 12:14:00,9065,(is this week a record?)   Not yet.....
322742,irishfield,2009-03-27 13:29:00,26272, Great to hear... a wonderful improvement over my days as a child when I WASN'T allowed an opinion Bob ! lol
322962,Radnine,2009-03-27 21:50:00,1538," Steve is right dude. There is a time when you have to look within and say ""did I screw up?"" and when you are outnumbered a bajillion to one, the answer is usually ""YES"". Jim"
322989,Billy Bob,2009-03-27 23:04:00,5865, LOL..... it was suppose to read NOT allowed but my fingers don't go as fast as my mind. As a matter of fact my mind has been GONE for a long time..
322991,Greencoachdog,2009-03-27 23:06:00,8163,I guess if we would all behave ourselves....

323003,misfish,2009-03-27 23:42:00,29133," Now Steve,stay off them darn wings bud.Hope thats light beer BTW. LOL   I was going to start a CAW/CRYSLER POST,BUT GUESS FOLKS CARE MORE FOR THE BIG BUCKS AND NOT THIER JOBS FOR A LIFE."
323005,Greencoachdog,2009-03-27 23:46:00,8163,  Do you really wanna flog that dead horse???
323007,misfish,2009-03-27 23:48:00,29133," Dead,is what they will be ,if they dont take thier pay cuts."
