323046,Beats,2009-03-28 00:52:00,543,That's a really cool video.  Thanks.
323081,msp,2009-03-28 02:24:00,1336,"Cool video. Growing up my grandparents lived within walking distance of the dam on the Ganny. Every easter it was a family ritual to go for a walk and  ""watch the fish jump"". Pretty amazing stuff. It was funny how a crowd would gather and cheer em on."
323121,Sinker,2009-03-28 04:19:00,8692,I like standing right where you took that vid from. The ones that jump aren't nearly as impressive as the ones that just power thier way up the flow........without ever leaving the water. Friggen awesome!!  Sinker
