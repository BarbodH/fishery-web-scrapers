Was out off cooks bay during march break found it  partially frozen in the ice & vandelized . pulled it off the lake with my son called local police filled a report with them . I have it stored with care at my residence . This is a very new unit 2008 or 09  plastic shipping was still on some poles  . only the owner would be able to discribe contents left inside  . you can contact inisfill police or respond to me . I am sure somebody is looking for this . any help would be apprieciated .
322931,Woodsman,2009-03-27 20:32:00,1286,You have done the honest thing reporting to the police and on the forum. Maybe a note on the Simcoe Board also. I'm on other boards & if I see anything I'll let you know. If you don't get a response at least you tried and than the gear is yours to do with as you please.  Best Wishes: Rick
