322511,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 23:27:00,207,"I wonder why they didn't use a SRT with a 6.1 and a RK Stang since they used a Camaro with 6.2 vette engine. We are witnessing the hp wars similar to late 60's, I was to young to enjoy it then but not this time!"
322515,irishfield,2009-03-26 23:33:00,26272,stop this now George.. before I have to go over to Chrysler and order an SRT. Wonder how many they'd give me for my 'bird ??    Nope.. just something about the old curves I can't go without...
322517,fishinfool,2009-03-26 23:38:00,366,Here's an interesting shot. Look at the difference in sizes of tires and rims. 
322519,musky66,2009-03-26 23:38:00,273,"Don't do it Irish, can't replace old school! They are pretty sweet though!"
322520,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 23:40:00,207," I'm trying to stay neutral here, isn't it working? Truth is my first new car was a 1979 Black Z28 with a 4 speed, had it for 9 years. If I could own anything I wanted now though it be a SRT 10 Viper powered truck!"
322522,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 23:45:00,207, What do you have any idea what that's worth? very nice irishfield I'd say one of the most desirable muscle cars in the world!  what else you got hiding around there?
322526,irishfield,2009-03-26 23:48:00,26272,And to think they couldn't get them off their lots in late '69 for $3400 !!   ..well I've got that old Southwind motor home peaking out behind it that needs a good home.. that '77 Ramcharger.. chopped 6 inches in the background...
322529,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 23:56:00,207," ... and you   fish too, I'm pretty sure your my newest most favoritest person!"
322575,outllaw,2009-03-27 00:53:00,1232,no matter what they say mopar has created the most desirable muscle cars. the hemi 426 and its other big blocks were the sweetest.. its hard to imagine seeing a 68 roadrunner with a 426 do a wheelstand. my buddies was incredible.. and no my other buddies mustang 428 cobrajet did never beat the hemi.
323109,fishinfool,2009-03-28 03:40:00,366,another nice shot for the bowtie lovers. 
322039,purekgw,2009-03-26 01:24:00,585,well after seeing mattones new truck it reminded me of the 2010 dodge charger and i must say if the come out looking like this ill sell my soul to have one  
322040,Maverick,2009-03-26 01:29:00,371,looks sweet can't wait to see them on the road!
322041,BUSTER,2009-03-26 01:29:00,1336,thats really nice!
322048,rbaquial,2009-03-26 01:38:00,968,Great... I gotta change pants now!  hahaha ITS A BEAUUUUT!!
322050,Mattones,2009-03-26 01:44:00,587,A site Super I work with has an 08 Charger SRT-8. He put in 10- 15k into it in Mods. The thing is FAST. But the 2010 looks just as mean.
322055,Mike the Pike,2009-03-26 01:52:00,3421,Now if I was going to spend my money on a Dodge it would be on the Challenger.  I think the Charger is a nice looking car from the front end but Dodge seem to design the rear end Fat looking.  Challenger is the nicer car.  
322060,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 01:55:00,207,I work in Chrysler Research and Development and usually know of new models well in advance of production and I have no knowledge of a 2 door Charger in the works. The Challenger is the only 2 door muscle car for now.
322061,purekgw,2009-03-26 02:01:00,585," ahhhhhh party pooper lol i was really wanting this to be realistic car its a really good design, and yes the challenger is really nice but like you said i dont really care for the rear end still nice tho"
322062,irishfield,2009-03-26 02:01:00,26272,"Well in that case George... put some true Dodge ""Hips"" on the next ones then would ya..."
322067,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 02:11:00,207,"nice, I have fond memories riding around in my friend's Dad's 69 Super Bee, 383 4 sp. It would hall ASS!"
322160,outllaw,2009-03-26 10:56:00,1232,"irishfield its memories. everytime i see that picture i think of drive threws, carhops on rollerskates.i love mopar muscle."
322172,babaganoush,2009-03-26 12:05:00,105,new the pic wasnt real when i saw the copyright date of 2006 and when i went to the website
322174,blaque,2009-03-26 12:17:00,2419,"""creating the lie"" as the website name is a bit of a tipoff as well lol  The guys got skills though, maybe dodge should be visiting his websites?"
322179,Mike Pike,2009-03-26 12:32:00,1332,"Thanks for that George!  Ya know, that's always been my beef with the auto industry.  Take for example this thread.. a guys post a pic of a vehicle that has everyone salivating and Chrysler isn't making them!  I really seems like all the major manufactures have been offering us their uninspiring designs for years and the ones consumers get excited over are just 'concepts' they unvail at autoshows."
322181,outdoor,2009-03-26 12:37:00,19,I'll keep my '66 
322225,irishfield,2009-03-26 14:05:00,26272," Sacrilege... them wheels! lol But them I'm one to talk with my Bee's CTC mags from the late 70's, but only because someone stole my originals. Beauty Charger outdoor!"
322238,outdoor,2009-03-26 14:27:00,19,"I hear ya, I did a disc brake conversion on it and the original wheels wouldn't fit back on so I had no choice. I'd love a Bee but looking for a 'Cuda. With a two car garage it's a shame to have an empty stall."
322239,tinbanger,2009-03-26 14:30:00,1028,"Dam,,,shoulda kept my 74 vw bug !  Neighbors older brother friend had Super Bee ( not sure what year ) but it was lime green ! That thing was fast ,was in it once , scared the crap otta me . he soon totaled it , but walked he away without a scratch.  TB"
322255,Raf,2009-03-26 15:20:00,3495,sex on wheels.. wow
322403,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 19:06:00,207,"the concepts are displayed to try out new ideas, the public's reaction to these concept vehicles is closely observed. If a concept gets enough attention at shows over a couple of years it has a chance to make it to market. The amount of market for that vehicle is what ultimately decides if it will be produced. The mustang , camaro and challenger were all concepts that got a lot of attention and are being produced, but these cars will not be big money makers, they are a image builder, the Viper is even a better example of a image builder and not a money maker. People's taste in cars varies a great deal and it's hard to satisfy all appetites especially in these times of making more profit rules."
322412,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 19:21:00,207,"Here is a couple of pics of my old Mopar, 1960 D100. I brought it in from Georgia last February, it is currently undergoing a frame off restoration. It took me years to find, I specifically wanted a 1960 same year I was born, short box and of course it had to be a Dodge. Dodge did not sell many pick ups in the 50's and early 60's making them very hard to find especially with enough left to rebuild.  "
322423,misfish,2009-03-26 19:47:00,29133,"Boys and thier toys. Dodge aint got nothing on this. Shelby  still got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RIGHT.    I still love the super bee though."
322428,GeorgeJ,2009-03-26 19:57:00,207,"aaahhh just wait, I wish I could tell you"
322484,fishinfool,2009-03-26 22:13:00,366,"I would have to say that I would prefer this Chevy hands down, way better lookin and more ponies to boot.  http://www.chevy-camaro-2009.com/ "
322489,musky66,2009-03-26 22:23:00,273,Not a ford or chevy guy but you gotta hand it to ford for keeping the 'stang goin strong all these years. Love my 66 too Outdoor.
