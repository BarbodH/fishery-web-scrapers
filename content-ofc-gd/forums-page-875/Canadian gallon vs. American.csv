323166,lew,2009-03-28 12:32:00,12766,My new boat holds 40 U.S. gallons & I'm thinking that is equal to roughly 32 gallons Canadian.  Am I correct ??
323170,ccmtcanada,2009-03-28 12:36:00,7971,"Here's the conversion...  1 U.S. Gallon = 0.83267 Canadian (Imperial) Gallons 1 Can Gallon = 1.201 U.S. Gallons  So, 40 US Gallons  = 33.3 Canadian Gallons."
323174,lew,2009-03-28 12:49:00,12766,"Thanks Cliff, I figured I was pretty close."
323178,Greencoachdog,2009-03-28 12:53:00,8163,"... but since they sell gas in Canada by the liter, you can expect to pump 152 liters into that baby the first time you fill'er up!!!"
323180,Guidofisherman,2009-03-28 12:54:00,206,"Yes, you are fairly close. Actually, 33.3 gal or 151.4 litres.  Here is a link to a program I keep on my desktop to do all sorts of conversions. This free little application will convert things like: volume, flow, temperature, mass, distance, etc. I find it very handy.  http://joshmadison.com/article/convert-for-windows  I also checked it with McAfee SiteAdvisor first.

323197,lew,2009-03-28 14:15:00,12766," The dealers paying for the 1st tank for me Glen and then it's my $$$$ after that, but I'm old school and still work in feet, pounds & gallons, and it definetely sounds cheaper when you only need 33 gallons compared to 152 litres  Thanks for those other links fellers, some useful stuff there."
323220,Beans,2009-03-28 15:18:00,3339,Let's talk dollars Lew...  152 liters @$0.80 per liter = $121.60  $121.60 divided by 33 Cdn gallons = $3.68 per gallon  Cripes ...whatever happened to that gas station out on Kingston Road near West Hill that used to sell gas for $0.29 a gallon ???

323372,irishfield,2009-03-28 23:13:00,26272, and it was RED !
323387,Billy Bob,2009-03-29 00:11:00,5865,When I pumped gas as a 18 year old kid the Exxon I worked at right in front of the Buffalo International Airport was charging 36 cents per gallon and we were the HIGHEST around. We charge a lot more because we were more interested in repair jobs and the owner wanted to make it our worth while to get out from under a car and pump gas.  BTW our gas has been rising lately. The Noco by my house is now $2.15 per gallon but I went crappie fishing today and got gas at the Res for $1.99 per gallon. The Indians are NOT discounting it very much now for some reason. We usually get between 30 - 40 cents off per gallon at the Res.
