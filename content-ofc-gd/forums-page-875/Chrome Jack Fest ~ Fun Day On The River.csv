322785,solopaddler,2009-03-27 15:37:00,8605,"Yesterday BillM and I ventured forth to a local trib in search of unpressured fish. Seems recently I've been faced with either high and dirty water or low and gin clear, no in between. Thursday was a nice change, the water was nice and high with a perfect green tint to it. Upstream the pools were filled with fish visibly spawning (left them alone). Downstream near the lake in the slower estuary water we encountered pod after pod of fresh, aggresive bright chrome fish. Almost all of them were immature jacks in the 3-4lb range. An absolute ton of fun to catch as they were by far the hardest fighting fish so far this spring. Pure muscle, just quivering with energy and almost impossible to hold when landed... Besides innumerable jacks there were a few larger specimens that surprised us now and again...  While fresh roe was pretty hard to beat  this type of water is perfect for jigs and flies:    If any of you old timers have fished Cobourg over the years you should know Henry Lee. He's been fishing there since time immemorial, usually throwing his very cool hand carved plugs. Years ago he tied me a handful of flies that have proven to be deadly fished under a float in slower pools. This is one I've got left and it bested several bright fish yesterday:    I hesitate to post all the pic's 'cause most of the fish looked virtually identical  . To avoid being redundant here's just a smattering including a few action shots of both Bill and myself:                                           Cheers,  Mike"
322791,troutologist,2009-03-27 15:49:00,951,Looks like a good day Mike. A good warm up for the Michigan trip I suspect.
322795,BillM,2009-03-27 15:54:00,17367,"Awesome day as usual Mike!!  I am still looking forward to the vis clearing up on the first river we hit.  Those l ittle jacks had as much energy as the early fall steelies I nailed in the Notty, completely non-stop!!!  Good luck in Michigan dude, can't wait for the report!  I'm sure you and Ferg will slam them."
322799,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-27 16:00:00,10439,"Hmmmmmmmmmmm, them flies look familiar. Didn't I tie you up something similar?? ?? 'em are good eatin' size chromers!!!!"
322802,solopaddler,2009-03-27 16:07:00,8605," You're right!, sorry about the slight.  (Dave tied me some a few years back copying Henrys pattern)"
322804,solopaddler,2009-03-27 16:08:00,8605, You got that right bud.
322805,Roy,2009-03-27 16:18:00,13728,Excellent report Mike. Congrats to you and Bill. Good luck in Michigan....as though you need it.

322819,jdmls,2009-03-27 16:51:00,575,"I almost regret PM'ng u Wednesday   .... I knew I was missing out. Unfortunately I get owned by my desk on Thursday's !!! Anyhow sweet report...Those jacks are a blast, especially on the initial hook set... Let me know about what we discussed so I can make plans for the weekend.  Bill...Get back to the notty for a couple weeks.... You need a taste of stealheading reality like the rest of us  Good job boyz...."
322841,BillM,2009-03-27 17:31:00,17367,"Dave, it's funny you mention that.  I stopped and fished  a Lake O trib on the way home just for the hell of it.  Hooked into an acrobatic 10-12lb bullet on my first drift in this really nice pool.  Had a good 1-2 min battle before the Raven flouro decided to come undone and off he was"
322850,Leecher,2009-03-27 17:44:00,7832,Great report and pics Mike  Can't beat a day like that!!  Congratulations to both of you Thanks for sharing Leechman
322856,tipupesox,2009-03-27 17:50:00,167,Looked like a great outing.  I pulled an identical fly out of the dorsal fin of a steel head I caught last Fall from a Lake Erie tribs.  I may have to tie it on one day and see what it can do.
322877,solopaddler,2009-03-27 18:20:00,8605, A dozen should do.
322878,solopaddler,2009-03-27 18:21:00,8605, It wasn't mine I swear!
322889,Ramble,2009-03-27 18:46:00,713,Nice Job Solo. Can't argu with non-stop action.  -Dave
322898,blaque,2009-03-27 18:59:00,2419,"You guys are killin me, Id run into you guys on this side of the lake one of these days if i was ever able to get out during the week lol. Would be nice to meet a couple steelhead folk from the board. Then you could show me once and for all how you guys fish that slack water so productively. A PM and 2 days notice would suffice lol"
322900,River Rat,2009-03-27 19:07:00,161,wow...way to go....you got into em alright.  Those pics weren't redundant at all...  RR
322930,Joeytier,2009-03-27 20:29:00,3990,Very nice report.  Those fresh jacks are unbelievable on float tackle.
