322829,Bernie,2009-03-27 17:07:00,3190,Heading to south to the International Center this weekend. Going to take in the Cottage Life show. Never have been to it before. Looking forward to seeing it but not too crazy about the drive down anymore. Anyone else going?

323083,Bernie,2009-03-28 02:26:00,3190, Yes it will all add up but haven't been anywhere for a while and ya gotta get out sometime! It has been a long winter. Thank you for your input barbless fisher.   Not much for crowds but it may be a good place to take the family for a day. Hope to see a few interesting things. Thank you for reply George.
