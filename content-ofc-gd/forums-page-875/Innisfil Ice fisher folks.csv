322945,mikeh,2009-03-27 21:09:00,824,"How much is the launch in Innisfil?  down in Bluffers Park they have a paved lot and spots for trailer parking, if a car parks in these spots they will get a ticket. When the paid parking is in effect(only certain months) it is heavily ticketed. I think the parking there is $6 per day"
322954,luv2drift,2009-03-27 21:31:00,147,If this fee really burns people......................It is common knowledge that the innisfil by-law officer gets a portion of the tickets he writes!!!!!what the heck is that?????  My point whether or not people agree with these strange cash grab fees such as Essa or Innisfil...........................DO you really want to have to pay lots of cash in ten years to fish at four or five places?  Some smart guy out there needs to come up with a solution???? anybody got any ideas?

322698,kickingfrog,2009-03-27 11:34:00,8333,Oh Oh!
322702,steverowbotham,2009-03-27 11:45:00,1800,makes sense
322703,babaganoush,2009-03-27 11:48:00,105,thats Bull i park there every weekend and have yet to witness any garbage left  behind or anyone riding anything on the grass. im pretty sure everyone rides on the road than access the ice from the launch i would agree with the paying if there was indeed damage to property and garbage left behind  but this is just Bull
322723,tributaryhunter,2009-03-27 12:46:00,108,"ha ha ha i seen that coming, not making a joke but i think there sick intired of the crap with the vehicles going through constantly this year."
322730,Gerritt,2009-03-27 12:58:00,6129,"Makes sense to me, if the city is on the hook to provide services for patrons who use the park in the winter months ie. plowing and garbage pickup..  then why should we not pony up a few buck to guarantee access to the resource?  better then the alternative of shutting the park down and gating it.  G"
322744,irishfield,2009-03-27 13:35:00,26272,They make enough every weekend from the $40 parking fines off the last 10 spots closest to the water !
322752,Woodsman,2009-03-27 13:58:00,1286,"As those spots near the ramp are clearly marked ""NO PARKING"" I have no sympathy for those ticketed. If the fees imposed are reasonable I have no problem paying. I was there 3 times this winter. It would only work if it was charged on entrance to the park. This could be costly as it would require an attendant or a pay as you enter type of gate. The second option would make it hard not to charge the locals. They could issue resident swipe cards but this would also add to the cost. If they tried imposing a machine to get a ticket to put on your dash than only more would opt to park on the ice only increasing problems. Also how do you identify local residents. Township stickers or dashboard cards issued? Or would you have to register your plate # with parking enforcement. All added cost."
322769,Mike Pike,2009-03-27 14:59:00,1332,Cash grab.  Nothing more.  And how do you sell it to the locals?.. Only NON-residents will charged.  Pretty soon the locals will have their lake all to themselves just like they want.
322776,Beans,2009-03-27 15:20:00,3339,I believe the locals already get a couple of stickers to put on their windshield for free parking during the summer...
322777,Fisherman,2009-03-27 15:23:00,7201,"Ya, always the few idiots that will screw it up for the rest who respect the free parking and don't leave their garbage around."
322778,Joey,2009-03-27 15:25:00,9122,"I have never seen garbage or the lawn torn up, so I'm going to say cash grab too.  Most people pull up, park, unload their snowmobile or atv, transfer stuff from the vehicle, change clothes and they're off, then reverse the order when done.  Where is this garbage coming from?  They ride their snowmobile or ATV down the dirt road to the launch, no grass involved.  Joey"
322780,LeXXington,2009-03-27 15:27:00,1928,Makes sense... pay to park but provide bathrooms  2-3 bucks please
322782,Zebco,2009-03-27 15:28:00,123,"Let me get this straight.  The whole world around Innisfil litters, but the Locals are perfect,  they never throw a cigarette butt on the ice, they never kept too many fish and never go back out when there limit is in the freezer.  I think All the towns surrounding the Great Lakes and the Niagara River should do the same to you guys coming down for trout if that's the case."
322784,Zebco,2009-03-27 15:35:00,123,"One more things, why would the Locals need free parking if they are local they can walk to the Lake or drive there skidoo's or quads.  Isn't it the tourist that put money into your little towns?  I stopped going to simcoe last year cause this Bull, used to go few times durring Ice Season and a few in the Spring and summer, but I would rather take my parking money and keep going down the road to a town that appreciates the money!  You guys that live around the lake should start voting in some Politicians that care about the Lake not raping the tourist!"
322794,Tybo,2009-03-27 15:53:00,1373,"Hey Terry, You hear this. They say they plow. The only thing that gets plowed down their,is you plowing through the parking lot to get out. They leave a open area so the locals can drive down and sit."
322811,edmichit,2009-03-27 16:36:00,145,"get used to this guys. We are headed into a user pay society. Towns, Cities, Provinces, Countries cant afford to offer very much for free these days."
322858,luv2drift,2009-03-27 17:52:00,147,WEll....WEll....Well......I hate to say I told you so but.....I posted a topic about the essa fishing permit a long while back and mentioned Innisfil doing this.  Half the people on here thought I was out to lunch with essa charging a fee and now innisfil is going to do it.  2020 should cost the average person fishing a pretty penny!
322861,luv2drift,2009-03-27 17:54:00,147,oh I am a local!  It is a totaly cash grab!  Locals litter! and Innsifil employees many employees who clean the area frequently.  The garbage debate is bull crap!  It's not even an issue.  Its wrong people litter but there is already staff on the pay roll who have the whole place cleaned up before noon on the first warm day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
322865,motv8tr,2009-03-27 18:01:00,2587,"Might mean the end of Fishing for Tyler...will have to look into that.....very sad, but lots of areas are doing this...  Maureen"
322867,irishfield,2009-03-27 18:03:00,26272, Don't think it would mean the end Maureen... but it might be worth a phone call or email to plant the seed to have them add a subsection that waves the fees during a fund raising event.
322883,misfish,2009-03-27 18:35:00,29133," Im sure Wayne would be willing to add some trout to his pool and even have a turkey fry.    It seems they think this will solve thier problems.NOT. So if I,m going to pay a fee,can I rip up the grass?  CASH GRAB ,just like Essa."
322902,Terry,2009-03-27 19:20:00,14456,"yeah right if you call that plowing then, I should send them a bill for towing charges..then I would forward the money to Paul and Joey ....for helping....me  it's a cash grab for sure  Welcome to unfriendly lake simcoe home of no parking no lake access and greedy towns "
322914,kickingfrog,2009-03-27 19:46:00,8333,"This type of thing really burns my berries.  Instead of looking for opportunities to encourage the large number of people who chose to recreate on and near the Lake to stay and spend even more money in their community they want to make the problem (out of towners) go away. The main reason this type of thing happens is because the people who run and are voted into positions of power are only concerned with the short term (the next election) and easy solutions (in this case taxing people who have no vote) to complex multi-levelled ""problems"".  I'll buy my supplies elswhere.   The best options would be to remove the park and the parking lot. That way there are no maintenance costs, no grass cutting, no snow plowing, no garbage clean up. Problem solved. If the people don't get the hint then put up a giant wall around the lake the, keep all the smelly people away."
322939,edmichit,2009-03-27 20:49:00,145,"Guys, take a left, and then a right hand on the next line......park on the ice. It's free. On the weekends or on a nice day, in the summer, unless you get up early.....don't bother trying to use the launch or the park.....it's full. I guess they don't charge enough."
