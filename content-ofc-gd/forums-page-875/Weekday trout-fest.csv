322631,Joeytier,2009-03-27 02:45:00,3990,"Decided to hit the lake and try for some trout, since the conditions were perfect.  NO wind, incredibly overcast skies, and a day after a strong east wind (which means off-colour water) meant perfect conditions too good to pass up.  We were fishing by around 5 and found some action right off the bat when I hit one on a twitchbait, only to have line break at the knot.  The fish proceeded to dance around on the surface with my bait in its mouth.  The next 70-80 minutes or so were quite slow.  Things started to pick up once we found a productive trolling pattern.  The majority of our fish came while bringing our baits over a steep drop off tapering off from 9 to 14-15 feet trolling crocodiles and cyclops in natural finishes.  We ended up finishing 9 for 11.  I was more than happy.  There is nothing that compares to the bone jarring hit of a brown.  The biggest fish, weighing in at almost nine pounds exactly.   The bigger of the two we landed on a double header right at dusk.  From this view, it only looks about 4-5 pounds, but it was incredibly fat, that it was closer to eight.   The fog was extremely thick, and coming back after dark was a chore, and saw a boat out there running without lights on.  Not a very good idea.  Now, back to the tribs with me."
