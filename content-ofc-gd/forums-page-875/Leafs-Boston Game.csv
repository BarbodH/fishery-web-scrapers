323055,ColdH20guy,2009-03-28 01:12:00,312,Hi guys Curious if you can help in referring a parking lot in downtown Toronto? Was lucky enough to get a couple tix for tomorrow's hockey game so my son and I are heading down from near Orillia..I have been down several times for different reasons(Jays games etc) but would also like to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame as well while we are down there..I was just wondering if anyone could refer a 'good parking lot'  ( was also looking at underneath the HHOF at Brookfield Place?..I know it will be busy after the game so a short walk is okay too to avoid the crowd and get back on the QEW/Gardiner... thanks guys Richard  Happy fishing to those going on the weekend.....

323065,ColdH20guy,2009-03-28 01:40:00,312,yeah that might be an option..havent done that for years thx!

Trip to T.O. from North Bay  Subway ride  Street car ride  Golden Griddle right down the street from the Gardens  pancakes for dinner  NHL game  Maple Leaf Gardens   Man when those tv lights came on after the anthem I nearly crapped myself... The ice was so white, the uniforms so bright.   Priceless... thanks dad."

323077,danbouck,2009-03-28 02:10:00,4380,I park right @ union station almost underneath the tracks. Gotta get there early though
