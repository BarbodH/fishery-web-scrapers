Any how, we put on some heavy weights to bust through and start getting perch. Lost a few on the ice , oh well.   After 1 1/2 hours the ice finally was gone and the perch shut down. We moved around  a bit to relocate the school and found a few more perch. That was it. Toss out a fresh minnow and before I've got the slack up, the rod bounces. No wonder the perch were gone. Pikies.    Then Bill got the monster.   Between the two of us we got a decent feed of perch and one pike joined the chowder club   I know what the puppies and I are having for brekkie tomorrow"
