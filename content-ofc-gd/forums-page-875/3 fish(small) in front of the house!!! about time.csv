Not much has been out there this year, but fishing is fishing for me...love it....and being a bit busier now (and for the rest of my life...lol) its convenient, if not very productive when the ice is here.  I'm kinda hoping that this year with the early melt we had, the lack of snow on the ice etc....that it will be as good as the 1st year we were here 2 years ago, the fish had definitely come in to spawn in our bay....and the fishing was HOT for walleye from the end of March till closing day mid April....anyway..................    BYE DADDY.....TIGHT LINES!          GOT SET UP 100 YARDS FROM OUR SHORE........3 SMALL FISH IN 15 MINUTES         THEN IT WENT QUIET WHILE THE SUN STARTED TO GO DOWN.......going.....going        GOING..........         CHARGE MY JIG ONE LAST TIME BEFORE ITS GONE.............         GOOOOING.................................          GONE          A COUPLE MINUTES AFTER SUNSET A FEW FISH STARTED SHOWING ON THE GRAPH...SMALL ONES          A FUN HALF HOUR OR SO....AND AN EVEN BETTER WELCOMING COMMITTEE ON MY RETURN FROM THE ICE  "

323264,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-28 17:38:00,2050,"haha what a great report man - I had a smile the whole way through!  I've got a baby boy due any day now so that video you took was just perfect!  I'm SOOOO stoked for my little man to be born.  Awesome vids of your sonar to.  I bet it'll help alot of folks on here who've never used one on the ice before!  I'm jealous that you guys live right on the water, but I sure heck wouldn't be living  that far north.... The fact that you're still ice fishing gives me chills!  Thanks for the report.  cheers, UF"

323376,smokin joe,2009-03-28 23:32:00,226,"Great post Simon, man I would love to be able to fish like that just outside of my house!   Man take all the pictures and video's that you can of your son growing up, it happens to fast.  Before you know it he'll be all over you about how he skunked you fishing, like mine does to me.  And he's only 8!! and I've been hearing it for a few years now  It's a great feeling for sure"
