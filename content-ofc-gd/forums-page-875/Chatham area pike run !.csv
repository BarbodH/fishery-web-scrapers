Never seen anything like it, though it would be pretty interesting....  Does anyone know if they are runnin yet ? or where a good spot to go see some would be ?  Sorry if this seems like a VERY dumb question hahah  Thanks"

322893,bassman,2009-03-27 18:49:00,384,I'd hesitate to answer this question because I'm sure some people would bring out the spears.
