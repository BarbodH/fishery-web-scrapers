Spend most of my time fishing a private, stocked bass lake just out spragues road on the country side, but am very interested in taking out the canoe around shades and throwin spinners all day long for some pike (heard there was a decent population of them). Having no knowledge of the lake, I was wondering if anyone could direct me to any 'hot spot's on the lake for pike ie. do pike hold at the mouth of the river, or should i concentrate more around the islands casting towards shore and so on? also, are there any lurres that produce more efficiently than others? much help would be appreciated!"
