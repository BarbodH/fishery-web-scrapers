322725,holdfast,2009-03-27 12:49:00,1813,"Just wondering who pays for disibility.  Both short term or long term.  Wondering if we the tax payer forks it out, or is it only the employer, or is it the insurance company.  Just wondering where the money comes from.  Trying to see if Im right or my wife.  Example my wife is getting short term disibility for an operation from her company If I was getting the same operation, would I get disibility from my place of work. Then there is Workers Comp.  Hurt on the job.  What are the differences"
322727,Gerritt,2009-03-27 12:52:00,6129,your both right.. The Gov does pay long term disability benefits.. IE.. Handicapped child etc...  or if you have private insurance through work.. and you injure yourself at work... then your benefit provider pays...   PS... the wife is always right..  G
322770,gdelongchamp,2009-03-27 14:59:00,199,"If you injure yourself at work and your employer pays WSIB then you are covered by Workmen's compensation.  If you injure yourself at home or for some medical reason are unable to work, if you have private insurance coverage through work and if your policy so states then you are covered by private insurance up to a pre-determined maximum. The government then will top up the rate to the amount required to continue to provide for yourself and your family."
322773,Beans,2009-03-27 15:14:00,3339,"When I worked for a living...(CBC)...The company paid for short-term disability insurance and everyone had long-term insurance deductions from their pay so in effect we paid for those on long-term but the insurance company monitored them...  If there was no hope of ever returning to work, the CPP would pay disability until age 65 when the pension plan and Old Age Security would kick in...OAS must be applied for...  Not too sure how long Worker's Compensation lasts...Haven't heard of too many good reports of them..."
322775,Joey,2009-03-27 15:18:00,9122,"If you have private disability through your work, YOU are paying for that by way of a deduction on every paycheque.  So basically you are paying yourself almost.  They take the money from your cheque and then when you need it, the insurance company that your company paid with the funds they deducted from your cheque, pays you back (although no matter what you have paid, they have to pay you until you are well enough to work again).  You also do not have to claim it as income on your tax return as it is not income, it is money you have already paid to the insurance company.  Joey"

Here in the states I had short term disability as part of my employer funded union run health insurance, it would only cover 26 weeks of disability and if the doctor didn`t word the request properly you couldn`t get it.  To give an example I was put off of work completely April-June of 2003 by the doctor, no problem they paid. For us a set benefit, 300 bucks a week, less than 1/3 what I made working.  Returned to work in June 2003 and not right worked 2-3-4 days a week, managed about 3, 5 day weeks until October when the doctor put me back on restrictions, but not off work completely. More or less a vague statement that I could work no more than 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week and at times a lot less, depending on my need.  Company would not allow my return to work under those guidelines, union work rules prevent my return to work under those guidelines, and union run health insurance refused to pay because the doctors statement didn`t specifically say I couldn`t work. Appealed, fought with them for a couple months, then decided if they didn`t want to pay 1200 a month they could pay me 3000 a month retirement.  Here in the states government run Social Security, part of it is Social Security Disability Insurance(SSDI). After 10 months off work my wife convinced me I wasn`t going to be able to return, might of been after she had to help me off the floor?  Confusing diagnosis from the doc`s, all agreed I was sick, but no clear reason why, nothing was showing up on the tests they performed that would give a clear diagnosis, maybes. 2 denials from SSDI on my claim for disability. A common practice here 60% are denied the first filing, lower number the second and I had to go before an Administrative Law Judge hearing(ALJ) to present evidence on why my claim should be approved.  Evidence presented, including finally a diagnosis from a specialist that took the time to run the proper tests needed to make the correct diagnosis, and I was approved back to the last day I had worked 29 months ago.  A lot of people here complain about Social Security, but have no real idea what it covers, and most of us are just one accident or illness away from disability.  Most long term disability insurance plans here are a trade off, you can get paid from them or Social Security but not both, SSDI won`t consider you unless you have been off of work at least a year or possibly terminal. Just guessing that most average workers can`t afford to carry an outside source disability insurance plan.  SSDI here pays based on income level and a portion of lifetime earnings, the more you work, the higher you income level the more SS taxes paid up to like 106,000 bucks, so the more they pay.  Workers comp? Here the trend is for the companies to fight all claims unless your broken and bleeding on the job."
