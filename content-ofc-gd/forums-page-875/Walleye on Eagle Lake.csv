PICKED MATT UP ABOUT 4pm         WE DRILLED A LOT OF HOLES FROM 28' to 12', I GOT THE FIRST RESPECTABLE FISH            AFTER NOT MUCH LUCK FOR 3 HOURS MATT GOT A NICE 19"", BUT IN THE SLOT SO BACK IT WENT....YOUR CHICKENS COULD BE IN TROUBLE MATT!        MATT GOT ANOTHER SMALLISH KEEPER AND I ADDED THIS TO OUR FEED.        BEST PICTURE OF THE DAY GOES TO BABY LIMEY THOUGH  "
