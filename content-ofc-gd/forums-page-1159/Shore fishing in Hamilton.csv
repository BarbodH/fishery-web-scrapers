106587,evster,2007-08-23 13:10:00,367,I'm going to be in Hamilton from Friday night to Sunday night.  I don't know if i'll have time to get out but most of the time when I am there I am just sitting around doing nothing.  Are there any good places to do some shore fishing?  Ideally i'd like to fish for bass but anything would do really.  Thanks! Evan

Lots of access along the length of this bay on both sides, so give it a go.  Plenty of weeds, so consider some weedless presentations in your attack."

If you are in the west side of hamilton, go down to princess point. lots of ppl fish around the trail there.  Note: you will be catching TONS of channel cats, before you can even see a bass...well, at least that's my experience..."
