It is suppose to rain tomorrow and I don't know how well we would fish tomorrow.  Does anyone have any experience on this small lake??  We are going to rent poonton and looking for Bass.  Thanks.

107118,pikeie,2007-08-24 16:52:00,380,"little can be good at times. lots of bass and pike to keep u busy, i like to fish the edges of the reed beds for the largies. lots of fish in the 15""- 17"" range, senkos and horny toad type baits will work great. inline spinners and rattle traps are great baits for the pike, most of them are 24"" and under but ive seen some 30""+ pulled out of there. a good spot was allredy said by Anatz the north east weed bed will get u lots of both pike and bass. good luck!"

107222,ace10002,2007-08-24 20:17:00,12,"I didn't know they had a web site. It's the first rental/camping ground on Duckworth St off HW400. Supposly, $60 or $70 per day for 14 footer and $100 for the pontoon."
