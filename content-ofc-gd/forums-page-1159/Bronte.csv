105747,Douger,2007-08-21 13:03:00,116," i bought a $25 Mr. LongArm painting handle at home depot.  it extends to 12'.  i cut 1"" off the end of the handle of my net to get rid of the plastic plug.  the net handle fits perfectly on the end of the LongArm.  i simply drilled a 2 holes and got some stainless steel nuts & bolts.  works well and fits in the car."
105877,mikeymikey,2007-08-21 19:42:00,376,"Ok, I understand what you guys have done with the customizing the nets but... could I see some pictures? so I can visualize."
105878,mikeymikey,2007-08-21 19:42:00,376,"Douger,  I remember you talking about getting some gears for pier fishing. Are you ready now ? What gears have you bought ?"
106022,henryko,2007-08-22 01:30:00,41,"Hi, I am new here. Can you please tell me where in Bronte did you fish? I have only been fishing in hamilton and only been catching catfish and small bass. I'd love to try out for some salmon fishing in Bronte.  I've heard ppl use marshmallow as bait for salmon. Does it really work?  Thanks in advance!"
106060,huntervasili,2007-08-22 04:00:00,1604,"lotsa people will fish with spoons (cleos and such) off many of the piers along the lake and particularily by river mouths... IF you look at these spots you will find salmon... I saw a pile of em jumping around when I was out tonight, and I got two good strikes but none were hooked... ohh well maybe next time"
106069,Golfisher,2007-08-22 05:06:00,586,"News travels fast.  Neither BPS nor LB had any 3/4 oz glow-in-the-dark little cleo's left, not even one.  LOL"
106228,henryko,2007-08-22 17:38:00,41, Thanks for the tips. I've never been to Bronte b4. so i should go at night for the salmon? like around sun-down? and where should i park when i drive there?
106276,tonyb,2007-08-22 20:05:00,1637,"Well after dark at this time of year Henry...at least an hour after sunset.  Early morning is good too, 5am when it's still dark.  Glow in the dark or rattling lures will be your best bet.  Tony"

106280,mikeymikey,2007-08-22 20:22:00,376,"I use Shimano Convergence 10'0"" Medium Power - Slow Action spinning rod.  Do you think the problem of not being able to bring in 'larger' salmon fast enough is due to my rod's SLOW action characteristic ?  Would a Medium Power + Fast Action help me bring in the fish faster ? or should I be using a Medium Heavy rod ?  (Couldn't find any rod longer than 8'6"" which isi MidHeavy)  (Slow Action = Entire rod bending) (Only Shimano label their rods with action characteristic of the rod)"
106282,tonyb,2007-08-22 20:24:00,1637,"You can get away with light line (8lb mono) if you have a long rod... 11'+  Otherwise run heavier line, like 30lb power pro (8lb diameter)...but use a uni-uni knot and tie on a section of mono or flouro (12-20lb) to help absorb some of the shock when the fish hits or you'll end up cracking off fish if you set the hook like you normally do when fishing with mono.  I don't think they are that line shy, you're fishing after dark anyway...  As for fishing the creeks, use the lightest possible line you can get away with (again longer the rod, lighter the line as the rod can absorb energy from the fish)  Tony"
106290,mikeymikey,2007-08-22 20:42:00,376,Thanks for the inputs!
106291,FishFinder,2007-08-22 20:46:00,481,"no offense mikeymikey but perhaps some things should be found out through trial and error, isnt that half the fun?"
106511,henryko,2007-08-23 06:22:00,41," Thanks a lot, Tony! Well, seeing as it's already almost 2:30am, maybe I'll just hit the pier tonite around 4-5am like u said!  now I just hope my 6' medium action rod with 10lb test line can handle the fish...lol"
106554,Burtess,2007-08-23 11:52:00,901, LOL I stocked up about two weeks ago and cleaned out the LB in Mississauga  Check around at different Walmarts as they carry them as well.  Burt
106816,salmon,2007-08-23 21:54:00,334,"I also hit a store on the internet a 2.00 each for glow in the darks. At that price I bought 22 of them, so I'am good for a while Last time I checked he still has some. Jose"
106821,mikeymikey,2007-08-23 22:07:00,376," Oh WOW, $2 each ?  Could you please share which Internet Store it was ??"

104951,dobee,2007-08-18 16:08:00,301,"Hey Everyone,  I got out to the Bronte Area last night and managed to get one fish in on a 3/4 oz Glow in the dark ""Little Cleo""  Weighed in at 21 lbs 6ozs On my Berkley Digi Scale.  Saw 6 fish hooked in and 3 brought in.  See you guys out there...    dobee"
104959,mikeymikey,2007-08-18 16:35:00,376,"Man... that must felt real good  I remember you've been talking about pier fishing sometime ago...  Yes, Last night was very chill night.  Have you baught yourself a new gear for pier fishing?  So there are a lot of fishermen out there at the pier now? or just on cold nights?  Do you guys think Medium Action rod is good enough?  I've been using Shimano Convergence 9' MediumPower SlowAction and feel little too soft for these big powerful fish.   I am thinking of a MediumHeavy,,, what do you guys use and what do you recommend?"
104962,Canuck2fan,2007-08-18 16:43:00,1444,Nice Fish!!!   Just about the same time as last year too. Good to know!!!
104985,Tybo,2007-08-18 19:07:00,1373,"Very nice.  What a sweet fish from shore.  Hey Mikey Mikey, is that your foot in your Avatar, and if so, what happend to it?"
104988,jediangler,2007-08-18 19:41:00,1923,Great fish. Good to know they are in the area. Thanks for the heads up.

105062,addict,2007-08-19 01:04:00,475,nice to know that they are close enough to get from shore.should be stagging real good in a week or so thanks for the report
105085,mikeymikey,2007-08-19 02:43:00,376,"Is that a normal skin color ? seem dark for this early, no?  What should be the minimum fish net handle when netting fish from pier?  96"" ?  Mine is only 48"" long and it seems to be too short.  For those who have made your own longer handle bar, what material did you use ? Would be nice if it can be removable for travel purpose. & or to fit in a smaller vehicle."
105086,mikeymikey,2007-08-19 02:45:00,376, Yes that is my foot and nothing really wrong with it... other than my pinkie toe laying on side.
105090,ilario,2007-08-19 03:47:00,166,"  actually, it;s not that dark...  i think its the pic, but they do tend to get bronze-coloured right about now"
105121,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-19 12:38:00,0,Nice fish!
105421,tonyb,2007-08-20 13:25:00,1637,Nice fish!  I'll remember to pack the shoulderpads next time out  I wish they would pave along the front (lake side) of the rockpile on the east pier to create more space for anglers.
105526,Canuck2fan,2007-08-20 20:28:00,1444, I made mine but going to the Restore in town and finding a length of cold rolled tubing that would go over the outside of the top handle. Drilled a hole and put a long bolt with a wing nut into the top handle. I then drilled a couple of holes for the inside handle with the press in button to fit into. I screwed up though and the cold rolled was a bit too heavy so the inside handle broke when I was pulling up a big bow hen. So I then looked around for something to go inside that was a little heavier. I lucked out and found a shower curtain rod would go. So I drilled a hole for the press in button and now I have a 13ft net. Two 5ft pieces that come apart and store inside one another and the original 4 ft section with the net that I leave a foot of inside the cold rolled tubing so it won't break there hopefully.... Landed about 20 heavy fish with this setup so far.
105535,Pigeontroller,2007-08-20 20:45:00,2793,Nice Chinook! Seems early for Pier fishin!
105547,mikeymikey,2007-08-20 21:24:00,376, Would love to see some detailed pictures of it...
105575,gusher,2007-08-20 23:01:00,1,were you also useing row
105615,mikeymikey,2007-08-21 00:29:00,376,Are salmons sensitive to line color ? Like Green color of PowerPro ?  Or should I use Crystal from FireLine if I want to use braided line?  Than again... Fireline Crystal is only up to 20lb test.
105663,salmon,2007-08-21 02:09:00,334,I use 40 lb braided line with 3 ft flouro leader and have no problems. I use a 10 1/2 ft St. Croix and a 250 Calcutta. 20 lb Crystal should be fine.  I had the Stren super Braid and the dye from the line was all over my hands. Never had the problem with power pro or Suffix SPB Jose

105668,camillj,2007-08-21 02:20:00,1988,  Mine was a really simple solution ... I got an extensible paint roller handle from home depot for about 15$ ... then drilled a hole through it and the original handle (about a foot up the shaft) and viola ... a 8' extensible handle for my net which can be removed or just twisted down to 4'.. fits right in my trunk
