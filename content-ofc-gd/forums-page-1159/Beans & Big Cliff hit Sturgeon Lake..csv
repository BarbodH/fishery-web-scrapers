We managed to sneak away for a few hours fishing yesterday afternoon. Started off with a small SM, then I lost a reasonable walleye, then not much of anything for a while, a few small sunfish, a couple of good hits but no hook sets. I finally checked my hook.... DULL. The winds were out of the East and starting to pick up a bit and we decided to try a point where the wind was blowing on shore.  We ended up hitting a school of nice size perch and kept enough for a feed, then just as we were getting ready to head home for some supper Beans managed a small walleye. that summed up the extent of our fishing.  MB came over and we had a nice dinner and a wonderful evening. Thanks to two very special people, we always enjoy our time together!"
