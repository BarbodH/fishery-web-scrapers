All of the bass were quite small so I didn't bother to take any pics of them.  On my way home I saw a very rare animal basking in the sun.  It was by far the largest soft-shelled turtle I have ever seen.  I've now seen 3 in my life.  One at the lower dam of the Sydenham in Strathroy about 15 years ago and one at the lower Pittock Dam in Woodstock about 2 years ago.  Both of these turtles had shells about the size of a CD, the one today was easily 4-5 times that.  I didn't know they got this big.  I took 2 pics of the turtle before it saw me and shot into the water.  I was way up on some sort of concrete breakwall off the beaten path.  The 2 other baby turtles appear to be snappers to me.  Odd shaped shells on them.  Unfortunately the pics aren't too detailed since I was so far from the turtles.  I'll be going back soon to see if it frequents that spot for basking.      "

Since I was a boy, that creek has held soft shell turtles, painted turtles as well as some massive snappers! Nice pics, thanks for posting! HH"
106599,MJL,2007-08-23 13:21:00,2427,Really cool pics!  I don't think I have ever seen one of those in the wild before.  The only one I ever saw was at Big Al's in their goldfish pond years ago.
