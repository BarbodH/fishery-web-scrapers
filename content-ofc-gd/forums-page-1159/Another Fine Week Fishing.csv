106227,Fishmaster,2007-08-22 17:35:00,920,Another fine week of Walleye & Salmon fishing and   ...both lakes seem to be on fire this summer .. the big kings are starting to get there staging colors and are getting bigger 4 days left to try to get a Sun Derby Winner .. Walleye fishing off Port Maitland should be still hot for my Tourney on Sept 1st  ;D we had big catches all week long with double digits of fish being landed  ...lets hope it keeps up for another few weeks before i end my Great Lake Charter's for the season ..then it will be Niagara River time  8-)
