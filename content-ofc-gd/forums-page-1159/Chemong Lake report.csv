106657,LeXXington,2007-08-23 15:58:00,1928,"Well, after some seriously stressful couple weeks of work I decided I needed a little R&R.  What else do you need to relax but some fishing  We did not want to head too far and with a little baby camping was out.  We decided to try Chemong lake http://www.lancasterresort.com/welcome.htm  Very nice little resort, with amazing staff and cottages,  The beach for the kids was in a little need of sand (in the water part) but the over all area was well maintained and super friendly people.  We stayed at number 9 cottage, this cottage was very comfortable with everything you would need for a nice week with the family.  The area bay was weedy, shallow. Super for kids fishing, etc but not for swimming or other activities.  I would stay at this place again and recommend it if asked,  Now for the quick report.   Fishing in the area was mostly Bass and pan fishes' lots, and lots of both. Nothing too big but good for numbers.  Walleye were there but hard to catch, I did manage to get one for the pan but that’s about it.  The real treat for the week was my little 4 year old catching her first Muskie. Ok you ask sure, sure..  Well here how it went down, Me with my high prices fishing rod, etc fishing for walleye with a Erie deary and my daughter with her $20.00 combo fishing with an Erie deary.  She said she had a fish, I set the hook and gave it back too her, that lasted for about 4 min as the fish stayed deep and dogged left and right, I thought she had a nice walleye no issues. Well the fish thought ok enough of this and started running that’s when my daughter nearly followed it into the water and I took over.  As soon as I felt the power I knew it was either a big walleye, or something else.  Fighting a Muskie with 12lb test, a simple push button reel and no leader was tough. Landing a Muskie with no net as our walleye net was too small. (used both hands too lift it in) was a chore to say the least.  So, a great week and here are some pics.    "

106660,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-23 16:10:00,698,WOW! Glad your daughter didn't fall in! You are the second person this week I've heard of who caught a muskie on an Erie Dearie. Did you tip it with something or just straight?
106663,fatherof3,2007-08-23 16:15:00,1769,great report and nice muskie
106664,mcallister.grant,2007-08-23 16:22:00,327,Nice muskie! I think I will try out that resort with my wife. Thanks for sharing!
106673,Rizzo,2007-08-23 16:35:00,4754,gotta love that.  I put my 34 year old brother onto his first musky yesterday...but that doesn't really compare.  Daughter and dad must be so proud!
106677,ccmtcanada,2007-08-23 16:41:00,7971,What a great report...complete with a muskie!!  I fished Chemong for the first time a few weeks ago and it's a pretty nice lake!  I'll have to keep that place in mind.  Thanks for the great report and pics.
106717,tbayboy,2007-08-23 18:47:00,1497,This boards gonna get a reputation for having kids that outfish their parents pretty soon .  Sounds like a nice vacation Lexx.
106766,joonmoon,2007-08-23 20:21:00,528,Your daughter has proven it can be done on low budget equipment. WTG guess she didn't wanna hold the fish for a photo...can't blame her though. Nice job.
106767,Pigeontroller,2007-08-23 20:21:00,2793,Its not cool to lay a Muskie on the floor for a photo...
107024,fishindevil,2007-08-24 14:01:00,6254,"Nice report  &  musky !!!!!!!! yes you sure did have your work cut out for you....thats for sure,great size and color on that muskie as well....cheers"
107042,LeXXington,2007-08-24 14:36:00,1928," Sorry, Dog is not a good picture taker and daughter would not go near it.  Told the muskie after removing the Hook we were fishing for walleye please leave the area. Then let him go"
107045,lew,2007-08-24 14:42:00,12767,"Good to hear you enjoyed your vacation Paul, Chemong is a favorite  lake of mine and I spend alot of time fishing there..  Congrats to your daughter on her 1st musky too"
107047,jedimaster,2007-08-24 14:49:00,3472,"Totally don't want to hijack or start a debate but, yes occaisonally when fishing for something else you are unprepared for a musky, and yes sometimes you need to do things you normally wouldn't do to a musky.  A stern talking to before releasing should keep all the other musky in the area away.  Great fish. Last time I went out my duaghters and wife out fished me. Its great that way because then they want to go out more.  Great fish, congrats to your daughter."
