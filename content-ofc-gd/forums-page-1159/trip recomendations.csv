106566,taper,2007-08-23 12:17:00,611,I want to try a different area for my family trip next year. I am looking at Bay Wolfe camp and am intrigued but want some other options. Prefer cottage not the Hilton but enough the wife won't kill me. Preferably Pike and Pickerel but any and all other species a bonus. Trophy not as necessary as numbers to keep family entertained. Prefer 8 hours or less from Toronto. I am also very interested in the Quebec Ontario border area and North from 401. Any area where wildlife sightings are a good possibility are an added bonus as well. Need to be accessible for my 18 foot bow rider aluminum or possibly a rental. Any one have any good experiences at camps they would like to recommend.
106650,tonyb,2007-08-23 15:19:00,1637,That's a pretty wide area with thousands of camps/resorts.  I wouldn't know where to begin...Lakair?! hehe  Tony

106788,FinS,2007-08-23 21:00:00,463,taper i might beable to help you out pm me with more info
106988,taper,2007-08-24 11:46:00,611,Thanks FINS pm sent. Seems hard to believe your the only one with a camp they would recommend.
107003,tonyb,2007-08-24 12:43:00,1637,"Oh ok taper, yeah I haven't fished the French much myself.  I'll be giving it a shot on the West Arm at Lakair this September, heard only good things about the area.  I think a lot of people haven't responded because the initial request for trip recommendations was pretty vague.  FinS, Solopaddler are your guys for the area in NW Quebec/Ontario border.  I think they both have family cottages up there.  Good luck in your search, let us know what you finally decide on.  Tony"
