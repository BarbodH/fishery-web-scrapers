106023,JustinHoffman,2007-08-22 01:34:00,482,"Hello All,  Spent the last two days of my holidays down at my folk's place just south of Ottawa. Hit the Rideau River for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon to gusting winds, cool temperatures and only one largie to show for our efforts.  Headed out late this morning to try to redeem ourselves...  The temps. were warm and the winds were down, but the fish still didn't seem to want to play. Worked a bunch of new areas that had excellent slop, undercuts and pads. We connected with a couple of small fish, but the miles that we covered left us scratching our heads.  I began to think that the cold days and nights of the last week had shut the fish down, or driven them to deeper water...  Here is a decent fish that was hiding under some shoreline slop, situated in 2-feet of water..    Headed to the back of a new bay I had never fished before. The shoreline was sporting some nice shade, deep water and overhanging trees. One flip of the jig and the fight was on! She was long and lean - can't wait to see her put the feedbag on come fall.  A nice 3lb 13oz largie..      The release shot..    Some action shots of the areas we covered..        My Dad lost a nice largie after a brief tussle, and only brought a small pike into the boat. I ended up with 7 largies and 2 pike. Not a banner day for this stretch of the river, but the 3-13 is a good fish to come out of this area...  Was certainly a fun day spent with Dad.  Until next time..good fishing!  Justin"

106027,fishdawg,2007-08-22 01:39:00,912,"some ""cool shots"" there Justin"
106030,Roy,2007-08-22 01:44:00,13728,MAN!  That's a super report Justin. Thanks so much for taking the time....I appreciate it and I'm sure everyone else does too! Great action shots also!
106035,Golfisher,2007-08-22 02:00:00,586,"As usual, a joy to read.  That release shot is amazing."
106036,Dano,2007-08-22 02:01:00,719,"Man that sure is some slop your fishing in! Looks like good fishing, good company and good weather. Hard to beat that."
106045,Deg,2007-08-22 03:03:00,51,I loved those shots of the slop Justin.  It brings back some memories of throwing topwaters like the Scum Frog and waiting for those brutes to burst through the pads.  I haven't done much of that since I started downrigging.  Sure miss it though.  Great report .. thanks.
106099,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-22 11:16:00,0,"I agree. I usually work that stuff with plastics. Maybe I will give the jig and pig a try. Anyways, great report. Too bad you fish alone most of the time. Would be nice to see some video!"
106106,Tacklebuster,2007-08-22 12:05:00,303,Those are some great shots.
106134,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 14:06:00,7971,Awesome report and especially the pics!  I caught my first topwater largie this past weekend and it was a rush that's for sure.  Thanks for posting..makes me want to get back out there this weekend again!
106383,JustinHoffman,2007-08-23 00:39:00,482,"Hey Deg,  Maybe we can swap techniques? I miss doing the downrigging thing back in the day when I lived in Whitby...  Johnny - the jig and pig gets thrown absoultely everywhere..  Good Fishing,  Justin"
106385,fishindevil,2007-08-23 00:47:00,6254,"Great release shot man !!!!!!! thats cool  ,great pics,good fishing too WTG   cheers"
106388,Rich Clemens,2007-08-23 00:55:00,3131,Glad you had better luck on the Rideau than I did back in July.   Love that last pic .. Did you pose for that one ?
106391,solopaddler,2007-08-23 00:59:00,8605,"Another good one Justin, great pic's!"
106392,JustinHoffman,2007-08-23 01:00:00,482,"Hey Rich,  The Rideau can be a changing fishery, that's for sure...  As for the last pic - my Dad was just shooting a bunch of film from the back of the boat.  Captured a real hookset, but alas, I failed to capture the bass...  Good Fishing, Justin"
106394,Rich,2007-08-23 01:03:00,3927,"Justin, great report as always. Beauty bass and awesome action shots!"
106397,canadian_copper,2007-08-23 01:06:00,925,AWSOME PICS BRO
106503,Deg,2007-08-23 04:27:00,51,"Sounds good to me Justin.  As much as I like the 'Big Boys' (salmon, bows and stripers), I do miss the largemouth whacking the top water.  It just gets the adrenalin pumping.  I have to ask .... how long is the rod in the last pic?  Lew ... if you read this, notice I didn't say muskies. LOL"
106584,JustinHoffman,2007-08-23 13:04:00,482,"Hey Deg,  The flipping rod in the pics is a BPS ""Tourney Special"" 7' 6"" Heavy Action....  Good Fishing,  Justin"
106590,MJL,2007-08-23 13:15:00,2427,Those are great pics.  Really like the release shot.  What type and how heavy of line are you using to winch out those bass?
106595,JustinHoffman,2007-08-23 13:18:00,482,"Thanks, MJL...  Have always stayed with Mono line for my flipping applications. Never had any real issues. The type I use is BPS Excell Mono, 20lb strength...  Good Fishing,  Justin"
106653,Pasquale,2007-08-23 15:29:00,29,Awsome report. Great pics and Nice fish. Don't you just love hunting the pads for buckets
