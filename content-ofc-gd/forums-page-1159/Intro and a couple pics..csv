106275,Shaun98si,2007-08-22 20:03:00,9,Hey guys just wanted to give a little into after lurking around most of the year. Names Shaun from the West Island in montreal. 27 years old been fishing since I was a little kid up @ my parents cottage. I took quite a few years off during my troubled years as I was too high and drunk on weekends to even think of fishing.  This year I got back into it hardcore and have been going out weekdays by myself on shore and weekend with my dad in his boat. Fishing sure does bring people together. me and my dad have never been so close. Anyways just wanted to let you all know I love the site and especially the trip reports. I will try and put a couple of them together from my adventures this summer.  Ill leave with a couple pics of a 5 day tent camping trip me and my dad took in july. If I get some time i'll put together a nice report. Lots of cool stuff happened. These 3 fish were all caught at the strike of midnight right off our little island we were staying on. Never took more than 3 casts to the exact same spot everynight. In one of them I was a bit loaded. I'll let you decide which on that is         Shaun
106277,Roy,2007-08-22 20:12:00,13728,Welcome aboard Shaun. Nice fishies. Glad you're back at fishing and closer to your dad.  I can't tell which of the three pics....I don't know much about that.
106281,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-22 20:23:00,0,"Welcome to the board. Its great to hear you are spending quality time with your dad. Those are nice smallies, but as far as which pic you look loaded in? I'd say pic number 2.  And number 3 you look a little buzzed also.lol"
106301,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-22 21:17:00,1183,"Welcome!  Let's see, pic number#1 could be possible - actually I think it is pic #1.  Number 2 you are just too darn happy.  And pic #3 nahhhhh.  Actually you look so different in each one...but I'll stick with pic #1.  Looking forward to more reports.  Nancy"

106322,Rich Clemens,2007-08-22 22:03:00,3131,Looking good Shaun.   Welcome to the board.  Pics like that ... you'll fit right in ... keep 'em coming.
106327,Mike the Pike,2007-08-22 22:10:00,3421,Welcome to the board neighbor and I think you look buzzed in all the pics.I have alot of shore fishing spots in Montreal if you ever want to hook up.  MTP
106334,Shaun98si,2007-08-22 22:26:00,9,LOL I guess it is harder to tell when you dont know me. Its #2 with my squinty eyes and crooked smile. That fish made my trip bigtime! I hadn't caught a large smally in years and I let out a good yeehawww before the pic got taken. My dad says its around 5lbs but I think hes being a bit optimistic (and a couple caesars too many). I'll dig up a couple more pics of her in a second.  Mike the Pike what areas do you fish? I been mostly going around ile perrot/vaudreuil/les cedres as their within 10 mins of my appartment but it hasnt been that good since the water has gone down a couple feet.

106341,Shaun98si,2007-08-22 22:42:00,9, Mike that sounds cool I been reading alot and have found guys mention you can catch all types of fish in the rapdis and even the odd salmon?? Id love it if you could show me around 1 day. I'm good for halfsies on anything. If you ever need a partner for a day drop me a line and Id be happy to join you if I have no set plans already.
106344,Mike the Pike,2007-08-22 22:46:00,3421,"Sounds like a plan .I mostly catch Walleye in the Rapids but I have caught bass and one Gar Pike,I have seen some Drum sheeps head,Muskie,Pike and Sturgeon all come out of the rapids no salmon though.All you need is a good pair of hip waiders.  MTP"
