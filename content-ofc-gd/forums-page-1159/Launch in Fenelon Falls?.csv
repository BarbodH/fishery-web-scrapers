A park or beach picnic type area would be all we need. I know the marina is there but prefer not use it, usually too busy especially on the long weekend. Any help or ideas would be appreciated."
106399,Rich,2007-08-23 01:07:00,3927,There's a free ramp right in town buddy. Not usually too busy. Just take a left right after you go over the bridge in town. Good luck!
106577,pigeonfisher,2007-08-23 12:37:00,696,Also the town park is a good spot to launch your VERY SMALL boats.  You would have to carry it though.
106697,douG,2007-08-23 17:32:00,2693,"Better directions to the ramp in town would be to take the first street north, just east of the bridge.  Dad launched his 1750 deepV there no problem.  If you continue north, the next street east of the bridge ends at the beach with lots of free parking nearby."
