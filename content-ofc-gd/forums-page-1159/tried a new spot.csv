What a long walk with a 6 year old. Anyway, got to the spot,waded in and started fishing. The water was higher here than in Paris so my hopes were up.To sum everything up my son fell in the water 3 times, refused to walk across shallow rapids and whined for the half hour walk back to the car. understood and felt for him. Went 3 for 4 with 2 tiny bass and this guy that put up a great fight. Want to try this spot some more when I do not have kids with me as it looked promising.Anyway, going back out in a bit to try some more.    "

106872,ccmtcanada,2007-08-24 00:07:00,7971,Half an hour?? Ouch!!  Been there and done that with my little one...you know it's not their fault and you feel sorry for them.  Good luck when you head back!  Hopefully with another report!
106874,pikehunter,2007-08-24 00:09:00,1659,"LOL, sounds like your son had a day he won't soon forget. I hope he had on his bathing suit. Looks like you found a nice spot to fish."
106947,Mike the Pike,2007-08-24 03:03:00,3421,Oh I can relate to that kind of a day kids whining sounds familiar thats why I take 5 trips per year with the boys no wife no kids no problem.
106974,Rich,2007-08-24 06:05:00,3927,"Great spot! Your son is a trooper, I've done a similar walk (actually from looking at your pics it may have been the same spot). If it is the same spot, then I've caught some really decent smallies out of there.. this one being the biggest:    (crappy cell phone shot)"
107013,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-24 13:27:00,698,I remember when I was a kid doing a similar walk with my dad. Only he was the one doing the whining
107144,fatherof3,2007-08-24 17:32:00,1769,"seeing that fish Rich makes me hope it is the same spot,lol. Ya, he was a trooper and wanted to go out again after a change of clothes. Maybe a different spot with him next time though."
