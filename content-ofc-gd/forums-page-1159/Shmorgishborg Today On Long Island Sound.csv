106707,setomonkey,2007-08-23 17:58:00,872,"Great seeing reports from you again, Ric!  I'd have to agree about the bluefish, I never caught big ones but even the little guys I caught in Florida hit hard and put up a nice fight.  Mike"
106710,Raf,2007-08-23 18:14:00,3495," Ohh I'm not interested in eating them.  You called them EVIL and great fighters, that's all I needed to hear."
106713,Whopper,2007-08-23 18:34:00,2174,"Great report FHR!  Bluefish are my fish of choice for catching off the piers in FLA. Although they don't get as big down there as they do up north they are great fighters. I had a 3 pounder about five years ago try to remove my right thumb while trying to unhook it, it was like a pitbull. I never kept them for table fair until someone asked me to keep a few for the BBQ, bled them right away and kept them on ice, fired them up on grill a couple hours later and they were delicious.  Thanks for sharing!  Whopper"

106852,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-23 23:21:00,1183,That was an excellent report!  Great pics too.
106871,ecxstriper,2007-08-24 00:06:00,343,"Blues are very oily but taste well when broiled and served with drawn butter. Nice take Ric . I  have been sitting out on a surf broad watching bait fish explode from the surface being chased by blues ,all around me . Pull up your feet !!!!!! I do love fishing for them in the surf when the strippers aren't running. I'm heading out to Sandy Hook on Sunday for Blues and Strippers"
106964,2kj,2007-08-24 05:02:00,77,"""Tasting like a used paint brush"",  LOL, awesome report, so different from fresh water, at least in the North......now the Amazon, love to see a report from there, Anyone?"
107097,ehg,2007-08-24 16:01:00,2666,"Very nice report! Nice of you to bring some salt-water fishing to the board. That fluke would be mouthwatering delicious cooked the way you describe.  Thanks for post,  ehg"
107113,Kirk,2007-08-24 16:38:00,347,"Great report, I've caught alot of bluefish the one time I was in CT, they were good eating, trim the skin off.  Some locals said they only kept them for cat food LOL.  Based on their numbers in schools and the way they hit and fight, I wouldn't be in a float boat with blues around, but thats just me, plus a stringer full of other fish...shark chum, again, thats just me. Thanks for the great pics."
106633,FishHeadRic,2007-08-23 14:28:00,226,"Thanks Guys! Joey, They arn't good eating especially at that size.  Their major prey is a fish called Bunker.  These bunker are actually caught and harvested for the amount of oil in them. The oils are used for oil based paints and things of that nature so when the bluefish get this big they just end up tasting like a used paint brush. Raf I' was talking to some of my friends the othere day and it's funny cause we consider them a scurge, especially when we're targeting other species. I was stating the fact that if you haven't caught a bluefish before that they really are an amazing fish to catch. But I guess it's kind of like those ole' timmers that'll just cut their lines if they get a muskie while fishing for walleyes. Grant, Wish that was my hood! Actually no, i don,t ... They're probably paying close to a hundred grand in taxes a year. CCMT, I figured the probability of seeing another OFNer there was at a minimum so.... Maureen, It's funny cause I really didn't give it too much thought until after the porgie got gobbled up. I actually had them on a 3 ft leash but tightened them right to the boat cause they kept gettin' in the way of my kickin'. Good thing eh?  GCD, Ive always wanted to catch a Jack. One of my friends worked the rigs and he used to tell me stories of them catching them on their lunch breaks and always getting into trouble cause they were lated getting back. :/  Fidel, Yeah It's so good to be home...  And thanks to everyone for all the replies. I'll try to keem em coming.  FHR"
106637,FishHeadRic,2007-08-23 14:33:00,226,"Oh By the way Dano,                                I've taken good care of her!  hehe   FHR"
106640,Tacklebuster,2007-08-23 14:41:00,303,"What a Great report!  Not that I didn't enjoy reading your pike reports from TO but that takes the cake, glad you moved... haha.  Those bluefish are like piranha's.  You got some ba!@'s dangling your foot in the water with those things and whatever else swimming around....not for me....boat only."
106645,tonyb,2007-08-23 14:55:00,1637,"Those blues just look MEAN  Great saltwater report, thanks for sharing."
