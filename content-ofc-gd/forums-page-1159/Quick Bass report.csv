The day started off great with a bunch of little 1-2lbers taking senko's and soft jerks and we caught them through out the day taking pictures only of the better fish   my little brother managed to pull in this guy here and it was his biggest of the day... not huge but a healthy little largie  Now it was my turn... Got this one on a fin-s shad  As we trekked the lake we met up with a pair of swans which have infact attacked my brother on a previous trip... But posed nicely for this shot  There were also a couple beavers too which werent pleased that we were so near their dam...  And this guy here is the big fish so far of the year out of the lake...And on a topwater to make it even better The last two pics give you an Idea of how unsafe the mud there really is and if you step in the wrong place or dont step there properly what can happen Before: After:  Lastly a nice shot of the area:   Overall an enjoyable day landing two pike as well one in the 20"" range The other a snot rocket being about 14"""
