106411,Dondorfish,2007-08-23 01:17:00,1000,"On the north end - there is a public (free) launch right in the town of Buckhorn - just down from the lock.  On the south end, there is a public launch on Chemong Lake - at the causeway - just south of where Chemong and Buckhorn join.   Hope this helps  Don"
106483,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-23 03:19:00,0,  Thanks alot Don!
106484,Dondorfish,2007-08-23 03:23:00,1000,"No prob! The one on the north end is kinda rough, but the one on Chemong is real nice - with lots of free parking.  Don"
106542,Blake,2007-08-23 11:08:00,418,Yes the causeway launch is better and easier for the launch and parking.

If you have a beater tinny I wouldn't worry but if it's a nice boat, don't bother. At the yacht club, there is a nice launch but it'll set ya back I think 10bucks."
