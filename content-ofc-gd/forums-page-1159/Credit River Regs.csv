106308,danbouck,2007-08-22 21:30:00,4380,I'm wondering if there are any gear restrictions on the Credit River for when the salmon are running.
106323,solopaddler,2007-08-22 22:05:00,8605,"Restrictions? there sure are Dan! DO NOT use one of these rods   With one of these reels mounted on it   And one of these tied on the end   While these types of rigs are commonly used on the Credit river by what I like to call, ""drooling, knuckle dragging bank mutants"", they tend to be frowned upon so steer clear!  (sorry Dan, couldn't resist  )"
106662,danbouck,2007-08-23 16:11:00,4380,lol any actual restrictions?
