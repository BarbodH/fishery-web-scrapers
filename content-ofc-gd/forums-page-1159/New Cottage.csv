106381,solopaddler,2007-08-23 00:24:00,8605,"Not mine, but it is in the family. My uncle just called to let me know he's closing the deal on this place as we speak. I'm pretty happy for him, I've been helping him in his search for the last 4 years now and he's been frustrated so many times at not finding exactly what he wants. He really likes the area my place is at in N/W Quebec and has focused his search there. As it turns out this place is in Ontario, 15 mins. from my landing. A lot of reno's on the horizon, but at least this place has road access, makes things a bit easier. When I rebuilt my place every single piece of material had to be hauled over in my little tin boat. Soon as I get off work tonight I'm gonna stop by and see him for a couple of pops and some congratulations. He's one happy man  .  Here's a shot of the cottage from the lake. Can't see it too well, but he's got over 200' of frontage including the little beach where he drove down to launch his cartopper last weekend.   Here's the view from the dock "
106384,fishindevil,2007-08-23 00:44:00,6254,"Looks awesome !!!!!!!! wow,  i can just imagine how good the fishing is ??????  i bet you 2 will be right out there as soon as you can.  ..i know i would,so enjoy and we are looking forward to seeing how things are progressing...congrats to your uncle    cheers"
106386,pigeonfisher,2007-08-23 00:48:00,696,Where is that?
106393,solopaddler,2007-08-23 01:02:00,8605, Larder Lake area.
106395,Dano,2007-08-23 01:04:00,719,"Yea, thats beautiful man, congrats to you and your uncle. What kind of fish are in the lake? Maybe a few lake trout, walleye and pike?"
106402,solopaddler,2007-08-23 01:12:00,8605," Bang on, it's got all 3, plus smallmouth and whitefish. Some really wicked back lakes 5-10 mins from the lake as well."
106406,FinS,2007-08-23 01:14:00,463,Mike your uncle has it made there that actually is my favorite lake when im up there the fishing is very good before moose season  ill send you a pm later
106412,solopaddler,2007-08-23 01:19:00,8605," I knew this one wouldn't slip by you Rene, that's pretty much your backyard!  ."

106428,pigeonfisher,2007-08-23 01:41:00,696,They have a great big GIANT TROUT at the north west end of the lake.  I always remember the big animals throughout Ontario.
106429,ccmtcanada,2007-08-23 01:43:00,7971,"Wow...one day I REALLY hope to have something half as nice!  This kind of reno is pretty rewarding...yeah it's work, but it represents relaxation and good times.  Congrats to your uncle on the purchase!"
106435,solopaddler,2007-08-23 01:51:00,8605," Yep, you're right. Whenever I'm giving people directions it's always kind of cool to say either ""turn left"" or ""turn right"" at the giant trout, LOL!  Have you seen the statue in Hearst of a bunch of wolves attacking a bull moose? That's my favourite, very cool!  Thanks everyone else for the congrat's, I'll pass them along shortly to my uncle."
106473,Joey,2007-08-23 03:10:00,9122,"Wow, only in my dreams.  Looks beautiful.  When's the party  Joey"
106523,Dano,2007-08-23 09:50:00,719," Yea, saw that this spring for the first time, it is cool!"
106526,OhioFisherman,2007-08-23 10:04:00,6623,"Congrats to your uncle, very nice looking area."
106530,Rich Clemens,2007-08-23 10:16:00,3131,Some day. I'd like to have my own cottage somewhere up in Ontario ... even though I'm from the states.    Congrats to your uncle SP.
106535,motv8tr,2007-08-23 10:31:00,2587,"Very nice, congrats to your uncle  Maureen"
106558,solopaddler,2007-08-23 11:59:00,8605," Hey, if there's ever gonna be a party it'll be at my place, BYOB (bring your own boat)   ."
106560,dustink,2007-08-23 12:02:00,526,Looks like my dream.......congrats to your Uncle!  dk
106627,TJQ,2007-08-23 14:21:00,7806,"Very nice!!  Now the ""work"" begins!!!"
106696,blaque,2007-08-23 17:30:00,2419,A dream spot indeed. I also hope to achieve my spot on the water someday.......but im in my 30's and it certainly doesnt look like its going to be anytime soon
106702,rob v,2007-08-23 17:49:00,535,"That sure looks like a beautiful spot.  I'm another one of the ""dreamers"" on this board that would certainly have something like this at the top of the list if the loto numbers ever went my way.  Without telling too many tales out of school, what would a typical property (fixer upper) like this fetch on the market?  Again, I,m not trying to be nosey, I'm just not familiar with property values of this type.  Thanks and pass along congratulations."
106716,tonyb,2007-08-23 18:41:00,1637,"Good stuff solo, nice of you to be so helpful, I'm sure your uncle is grateful!  Now, when do we get to come up and get a 'tour' of the lake *ahem* property  Tony"
106720,solopaddler,2007-08-23 18:49:00,8605," Headed up with the Miloman sometime next month, you're welcome if you'd like Tony!  To Blaque and Rob V: You'd actually be surprised how cheap some of these properties can be if you're willing to drive far enough north. I bought mine 5 years ago for 25K.... My uncle spent a bit more than that, but then my place is in Quebec. For whatever reason prices seem to be a wee bit more in Ontario."
106731,rob v,2007-08-23 19:27:00,535,thanks - that gives guys like me hope.  I did a quick google search and found this.   Even at this price it isn't completely out of the question.   I guess I'll have to start looking north !  http://www.nt.net/getin/Northeastern_Ontar...s_property.html
