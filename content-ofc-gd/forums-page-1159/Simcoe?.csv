I was wondering if any one on here knows whats biting good in there... I need to find a place with rental boats as well so if someone knows of a good launch near some fishing spots it would be greatly appreciated...Any species is great and if someone knows a perch spot thatd be awesome too..Shoot me a pm or message on here with any info...  Thanks for the help, Bill"
106886,Sinker,2007-08-24 00:40:00,8692,"I'd recomend  you stick to the west side of the lake.....they're calling for some crappy weather to be fishing simcoe tomorrow.  Unfortunatly, I don't know the west side of the lake at all....  Sinker"
106895,discophish,2007-08-24 01:07:00,392,"If you start off in Lefroy there is a public boat launch there, with a parking lot just up the street.  You should park in the designated parking lot.  Work south past the first point on the West side, and find that 15 foot break contour.  Follow it south into the bay until you lose it.  Not sure where the perch are hanging out, but I was fishing between snake and fox island in 55 fow bouncing jigs on the bottom not too long ago, and caught a couple.  Took me by surprise.  Never caught perch that deep before.  Good luck!"
106913,huntervasili,2007-08-24 02:08:00,1604,should I stick with one of the two main bays.. I wanted to stick to the southern part of the lake if possible... any one know how rough the waters gonna be tomorrow?
106917,ccmtcanada,2007-08-24 02:11:00,7971,"Hard to say about the waters, just be on the watch for thunderstorms.  There is a 60% chance tomorrow...can kick up high winds and waves in a matter of minutes.  Oh yeah...I hear lightning isn't that much fun either...  "
