106295,danbouck,2007-08-22 21:00:00,4380,1 inch. Depends could have a nice time to fish then downpour or just a steady rain all day. But I'm not a weatherman
106298,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-22 21:04:00,0,I guess either way its going to rain alot... DANG!!!!
106305,lew,2007-08-22 21:25:00,12767," Not really any of my business Johnny B, but I'm just curious as to why you'd cancel a day of fish'n just because it's gonna rain.  Some of my best days of catching have been on some of the most miserable days of weather.  The day will be dull with probably a nice chop on the water and most of the other boaters will be at work, so you'll have the waters to yerself. Put on your rainsuit, preferably Gore-Tex, and go out and enjoy the day."
106307,solopaddler,2007-08-22 21:29:00,8605,Being in the weather business I can tell you it's not an exact science  . Go fishing!
106309,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 21:31:00,7971,AND the fish dont mind if it rains
106321,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-22 22:03:00,0,Yes Lew but its not only the rain... Its calling for thunderstorms.....
106328,Milty,2007-08-22 22:10:00,121,"I been waiting for a good rain for a while,..BRING ON THE Nooks!!!!"
106403,Rich,2007-08-23 01:12:00,3927,"Johnny, Johnny.. I thought by now you'd have a rain suit!"
106446,Greencoachdog,2007-08-23 02:15:00,8163, 'cause they're already wet!!!
106453,Nemo,2007-08-23 02:21:00,727,Johnny go fishing it's not like your shirts gonna get wet..
106455,ccmtcanada,2007-08-23 02:27:00,7971,"The equivalent in snow is 20 to 25 centimeters.  So, I'd say it's a lot.  I just looked at historical weather for Toronto...June and July each had about 45mm of rain total....so if we do get 20 to 25mm, then that's half that amount...all in one day."
106458,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-23 02:34:00,835,"Project for tomorrow is to set up irrigation, I've  watched rain miss us all summer."
106459,Garyv,2007-08-23 02:36:00,547,1 millimeter = 0.0393700787 of an inch therefore 20mm is 0.787401574804 of an inch and 25mm is 0.9842519685050001 of an inch
106461,pameladallaire,2007-08-23 02:43:00,470,"In other words, 1/2 as much as we will get tomorrow, 50 cm. and it's been raining almost every day this summer!  Pam"
106481,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-23 03:18:00,0,Looks like I am going anyways!  I hope I dont get hit by lightning or the boat sinks!!!
106488,POLLIWOGG,2007-08-23 03:37:00,835,Leave the rod up in a holder so your head isn't the highest thing in the boat.
106563,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-23 12:09:00,2585,SOme people say there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.  Although if there are t storms i would stay home for sure!  Cheers!
106572,OhioFisherman,2007-08-23 12:28:00,6623,How much is 20-25 mm of rain? What? Americans aren`t supposed to know! LOL Closet Yank?
106573,bowshep,2007-08-23 12:28:00,378,"Hey Milty wecome to OFC. Milty is the person that got me fishing again and for that l would like to thank him for all the quite times on the water, With me thinking of gaffing myself or chucking myself off a pier. lol Peace Ken"
106693,Canuck2fan,2007-08-23 17:17:00,1444, I don't know how big his boat is but having been on a pier one morning where lightning struck a lamp-post about 25ft away I can safely say I sure wouldn't want to be on anything less than the QEII using that strategy.....  LOL
