Your make your cast, or your trolling, and you get a good hit, set the hook, and its Fish On!  Before you know its like the karate kid, Fish Off!   So the question is, which type of lure you have lost more bass?  I forgot to include surface/top water baits, so if you wish, you can just mention it in your reply.  Thanks for you responses, and of course, Happy Fishing.  Oh ya, my choice was spinner baits."
106070,OhioFisherman,2007-08-22 05:47:00,6623,"I didn`t vote, surface lures, whether a buzzbait or hard body. You are waiting to set the hook until you feel the fishes weight, but does the fish have it in it`s mouth? A hook caught slightly in a fin or other body part? Their miss or my loss? If I stick them I don`t lose many no matter what the lure.  Just harder to get a good hook up with a surface lure, they miss."
106083,Terry,2007-08-22 10:13:00,14456,if there was top water as a choice I would vote for that
106101,Tacklebuster,2007-08-22 11:23:00,303,"I realized after I set up the poll that I forgot to include top water baits, and I don't know how to or if I can still add it.  Thanks Terry, and OhioFisherman."
106102,misfish,2007-08-22 11:32:00,29133,My vote was spinner baits.They like to spit them out WAY to often.LOL  Good poll TB.
106119,charlesn,2007-08-22 13:05:00,551,"Given the choice between any single big hook lure (spinnerbait, buzzbait, worm, jig, etc. usually on heavy line) or a multi-little-treble hook bait (popper, jerkbait, rattlebait, crankbait usually on lighter gear)...  Gimme the big meat hook every time.  If you fight it for 3 seconds versus 30 seconds, there's less chance of something going wrong.  Charles"
106171,tonyb,2007-08-22 15:05:00,1637,My vote would be for topwaters too.
106174,kissmybass,2007-08-22 15:07:00,36,i voted for spinners... but top water is also works very well  you gearing up for bass? i know i am... monday will be my first outting to kick start the trophy season
106204,jedimaster,2007-08-22 16:14:00,3472,Have had more misses on a jitterbug than anything else but I love he little blub blub blub.
106220,fishboy,2007-08-22 17:18:00,550,top water
106231,huntervasili,2007-08-22 17:54:00,1604,Yup... Topwater for me too.... The other day I was out and missed so many on the frogs cause the fish just wouldnt bite down on it and instead just tried to swallow it or would miss them by striking too far behind
106264,Mr Twister,2007-08-22 19:23:00,71,Top for sure!!!
106325,singingdog,2007-08-22 22:07:00,1047,"Depends on what you really mean.... 1. fish that you have on then toss the lure, or 2. solid hits that don't end up in hook-ups  Plastic frogs are the all-time high for #2. So much so that I don't use them anymore. Otherwise, spinnerbaits and jigs are right up there for highest percentage of hookups that result in lost fish."
106410,Rich,2007-08-23 01:16:00,3927,I just never lose fish... HA RIGHT!  Most of my lost fish are on buzzbaits. Not really lost fish so much as missed hits.
