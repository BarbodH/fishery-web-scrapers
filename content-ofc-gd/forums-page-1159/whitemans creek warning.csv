105836,fatherof3,2007-08-21 17:24:00,1769,"August 16, 2007  Anglers asked not to fish for trout in Brant area streams The Ministry of Natural Resources is asking anglers to voluntarily refrain from fishing for trout in several streams in the Brantford and Burford area. Fish populations, particularly brook and brown trout, are under stress from this summer's low water levels and higher than normal water temperatures. Species such as brook and brown trout need cold, clear water to survive.  Anglers are asked to voluntarily stop fishing on Whiteman Creek west of Brantford, Mount Pleasant Creek south of the city, and upper MacKenzie Creek - upstream of the town of Oakland until conditions improve in these cold water streams.  Water levels on these streams are at or near record low levels. The low water levels combined with elevated in-stream temperatures have put trout populations in some reaches or sections of the streams at risk. It is possible that the low flows and warm temperatures have already resulted in the loss of some fish and the situation could worsen if the hot and dry conditions continue.  The ministry asking anglers to use other water bodies and to fish for species, such as large and smallmouth bass or carp, which are more tolerant of warmer water and reduced flows.  Just thought I would share this in case anyone had thoughts of going to Whitemans and with time of year.This was taken right from the GRCA website."
105838,Roy,2007-08-21 17:33:00,13728,Thanks for the heads up.
105840,Mike Pike,2007-08-21 17:35:00,1332,"A good post Fatherof3.  Thanks for that.  Times like this, the resident brookies and brows really suffer."
105848,ADC,2007-08-21 17:51:00,82,Count me in or out... meaning... I wont fish there for trout!
105886,chewy,2007-08-21 20:01:00,40,i wont fish there either but others just dont give a crap and will fish there anyways.i will let others know what the ministry are asking
105890,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-21 20:06:00,698,They should get a sign up there as most recreational anglers would probably have no idea.
105904,aniceguy,2007-08-21 20:27:00,1094,sad part is that by mentioning certain creeks lurkers now have an additional area to google earth and pull trout out for dinner.......sorry for the rant just came outa no where
105910,canadian_copper,2007-08-21 20:52:00,925,WELL YA KNOW HOW THE POWER OF THE INTERNET WORKS LOU!!! TRY AND DO SOME GOOD AND THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE A BAD SIDE TO IT!!! JUST LIKE HELPIN OUT AT FISH LIFTS!!! YOUR TELLIN REGULAR LOOGANS WHERE THEY CAN CATCH THEM!! DONT THINK WE'LL EVER WIN  LOL  STILL GOOD TO SEE POSTS OF PEOPLE TRYIN TO HELP!!!
105913,Riparian,2007-08-21 20:55:00,269,"Why do they ask? Why not just close... I mean they dont ask us to voluntarily stop having fires during a fireban. Its like they are saying that they would like people to not fish for trout, but cant really do anything to stop it."
105915,aniceguy,2007-08-21 21:01:00,1094,  because the OMNR doesnt have the capacity to enforce a closure due to stressed thermal regime
105917,misfish,2007-08-21 21:02:00,29133,"If the MNR is SO WORRIED,then post NO FISHING SIGNS.   IT,S THAT EASY.  They are the LAW after all.  All the creeks and streams and rivers in this area,are WAY DOWN.Some are even a slow trickle. They are in a VERY SAD STATE.  The Mad is 1/2 of what it should be,the Bear, well I have not seen it this bad ever. The fall salmon run is going to be DEVISTATED ."
105926,Riparian,2007-08-21 21:19:00,269,That is exactly my point. They are the law arent they? They have the capacity to enforce all the other laws that protect us and our resources.
106007,huntervasili,2007-08-22 00:44:00,1604,yup I took a drive up to whitemans two days after I returned from Quebec and I was suprised at how low it was in some spots... It didnt seem particularily low where I was but It was particularily warm... After checking it out and seeing how the temp was I headed out to the dam where you can catch bunches of smallies... no need to kill trout when you can have fun with otherfish too
106016,Greencoachdog,2007-08-22 01:04:00,8163,I thought it was already like freezin' cold up there?
106031,pikeie,2007-08-22 01:52:00,380,"the local creeks i fish are very low now, i was at a creek later on today and the water has droped a foot. i still fished it but only in the deeper and colder pools. i infact saw some very nice brook trout today in some very shallow water and didnt bother to cast to them as i figured they were under to much stress as is. i still got some nice brookies today in the deeper pools and they still took off strong"
106136,ccmtcanada,2007-08-22 14:12:00,7971,"Was talking to a guy the other day about trib fishing.  He said he caught 3 in an east end trib recently and released them all.  They all swam away, but when he walked down stream, he noticed 2 were floating.  He packed up his stuff and left even though he could have likely caught all day long.  It's always refreshing to hear this from fellow anglers."
106356,fishindevil,2007-08-22 23:12:00,6254,"Well thats to bad,but like mishfish said why dont they just put up NO-FISHING SIGNS AND CLOSE IT FOR A WHILE ?????????? and yes right now our eastern tribs are so low its unreal....on the news they said its the driest summer since 1959...dam we need rain  and lots of it....."
106859,JerseyDog,2007-08-23 23:34:00,190,"Interesting.  In BC, if the MNR there feels like a river is under stress, or there is a run on that is OOS and there is too much risk for incidentals catches, they will just close it.  MNR in Ontario should have the same power."
