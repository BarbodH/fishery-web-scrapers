105174,TJQ,2007-08-19 15:46:00,7806,Im more familiar with the north end of the park... im pretty sure douG will be able to help you out.
105515,douG,2007-08-20 19:57:00,2693,"Sure thing, Boss.  I've got some experience on Opeongo for lakers, mostly in the north arm.  Try the trench in the bay near Hailstorm creek, and also the north shore near the portage to Proulx.  You will need to fish 20-40 ft down for the lakers.  I don't usually target the sm bass, but I understand that there's plenty.  It's a very beautiful place - I hope you enjoy your trip, fish or no.  Good Luck."
