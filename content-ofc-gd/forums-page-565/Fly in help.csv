543190,taper,2011-01-24 22:29:00,611,"I want to take my dad, mom wife and son on a fly in in 2012. I remember seeing one that flew out of Goderich Ontario for a week each year but can't seem to find it now. Also if any one has any suggestions I would love to hear them. I am looking for Pike and pickerel mostly but extra species are a plus. I want American plan with a good reputation for food and service. It can be fly in or drive to. I am leaning toward staying in Ontario just to keep the costs down. I am planning for something around $2000 per person for 5-7 days. Any help you guys can give is greatly appreciated."
543288,grt1,2011-01-25 01:14:00,638,"check out stormer lake lodge on google to get their web site, it's north of Red Lake and it's a drive to camp but it has american plan and the fishing is excellent for walleye and northerns. Everyone meets at lunch at a spot on the lake for a shore lunch everyday. the boats and motors are in great condition and the meals are delicious.  I don't know what their prices are like but their website should be able to provide them."
543293,BillM,2011-01-25 01:20:00,17367,Should have lots of choices in that price range!
543294,danc,2011-01-25 01:20:00,4677," That entire area is full of fish. I spent an evening fishing off the Golden Hook dock (Gullrock)and couldn't beleive the fishing. Long story but I actually caught a 23"" Walleye before I even started fishing. And I caught bigger ones after I actually started fishing. If you don't mind driving for a while, the Red Lake area is awesome."
543295,thebigcatch,2011-01-25 01:23:00,138,Look in ur pm
543313,Hubbard,2011-01-25 02:07:00,22,"You are looking for www.oldpost.com, they fly out of Goderich direct to Pickle Lake.  John Grace is the one who runs it."

543536,taper,2011-01-25 21:27:00,611,Thanks for all the great info guys. I have some deciding to do.
543566,adempsey,2011-01-25 23:49:00,1498,"These are the places I would check out if I had $2k to spend:  http://www.hawk-lake.com/index.htm http://www.leuenberger.ca/landing.html http://www.birchislandresort.com/rates http://www.kesagami.com/ http://www.liddles.com/ http://www.esnagami.com/default.asp  Haven't been to any of them though, but want to go to all of them.  There are probably plenty more.  One of my other favorite spots is on Lady Evelyn Lake.  Several boat to lodges that are all good:  http://www.garden-island.com/ http://www.island10.com/ http://www.redpinelodge.com/  Good luck!"
543580,thebigcatch,2011-01-26 00:24:00,138, Well at last you have the best 1 frist lol that's where I do my guiding
543587,solopaddler,2011-01-26 00:39:00,8605,I can recommend a bunch that I've been to personally. Shoot me a pm if you're interested.
543723,corvette1,2011-01-26 12:58:00,1765,been to leuenbergers 5 times awesome fishing would go back in a minute
544173,taper,2011-01-27 13:02:00,611,Corvette1 I noticed on the Luenbergers site you need to provide your own life jacket and boat safety kit. This seems very odd on a fly in.Did you have to supply these items?
544254,Tom McCutcheon,2011-01-27 16:27:00,627,"I can vouch for Esnagami. It is a very comfortable and well run camp. More than enough walleye to keep you occupied and for shore lunches. Monster pike and Eric also will provide a guided day trip to a remote speckle river/stream for spectacular natural trout drift/wading fishing. At the end of the day there is a sauna to relax in before lights out. A lot of other good choices have been mentioned also. Book early, these places fill up quickly.  Good luck and have fun."
544274,solopaddler,2011-01-27 17:00:00,8605," Not sure about a safety kit, that's a bit odd, but pretty much every fly in operator except the fancy lodges require you to bring your own pfd."
544462,adempsey,2011-01-28 00:38:00,1498," That would be for their outpost camps, I am pretty sure it would not be required if you stayed at the lodge."
544636,corvette1,2011-01-28 14:16:00,1765,all my trips were at keg lodge not at a outpost camp i allways bring my own pfd i like the zipper pfd and they don't weight much
560780,taper,2011-03-11 21:14:00,611,"I finally sat my parents down and hammered out a decision. My dad is not big on flying so we are going to look for a drive to American plan lodge. We are going to look at a trip of roughly two weeks, one week at the lodge and 2 or so days travel each way. I am in London so I think this can get me into some very good fishing in North Western Ontario. Do you have any recommendations for lodges that would fit the bill? I want to keep everyone interested with decent numbers and again the chance of large pike for my fathers personal best would be great. Thanks again. Mike"
560786,adempsey,2011-03-11 21:33:00,1498," edit: missed that you would be willing to drive to NW Ontario - in that case there are probably a lot of places.  Lac Seul, Minnitaki, Eagle Lake, Lac Des Mille and Lake of the Woods are very popular and I am pretty sure have a lot of drive to camps [most are large lakes].  It's probably in your best interest to try some of the US fishing forums since the majority of guests at these lodges are from the US."
560788,Live2fish85,2011-03-11 21:37:00,1633,I did a Fly in trip to from Temagami they have a bunch of different cabins on small lakes that are just packed we did 2 days and caught over 200 pike it was a great trip. They supply you with 2 boats all the gas and it was beautiful there seen some bears the one day on the other side of the lake I would recommend them for sure. They were great people and it wasn't bad at all on the costs. I would check them out for sure. It's Called Lakeland Airways. Great Fishing Specially Pike.
560797,solopaddler,2011-03-11 21:53:00,8605,"Lake Nipigon is potentially the best multi species drive-to destination in the province.  Not too many outfitters though.  There's a few few guys that run trips on massive boats with sleeping berths, pulling the fishing boats behind.  I'm sure a google search would unearth a few.  These guys are located on the east side and offer access to Nipigon as well as some great back lakes:  http://www.onamanriverresort.com/"
560837,Blue Lk,2011-03-11 23:53:00,337,"There are lots of resorts in this area,Lac Seul is very good fishing. Here is a link to most lodges in NWO  http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/accom.cfm"
560897,taper,2011-03-12 01:56:00,611,Thanks again guys for all the options.
