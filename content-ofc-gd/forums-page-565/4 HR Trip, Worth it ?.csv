Thanks in advance,  Pepe  P.S. if you are more comfortable you can pm me."
560907,Ron,2011-03-12 02:18:00,1683," If you wanna fish HIGH water the color of Chocolate milk, come on down. The Ganny for an example was about 2ft from going over the banks. Still more rain in the forecast. It will take at least 4 days in my opinion to be fishable.  Cheers, Ron...."
560910,irishfield,2011-03-12 02:21:00,26272,..and Ron's not   ya... because he'll drive 13 hours EACH way to fish a lake for 3 hours!
561106,Pepe,2011-03-12 17:45:00,21,"Thanks guys for responding, I checked the water levels online, and they seem to indicate a drop in water level. I'm going to make the suicide run anyway and try to make the most out of it. If you have any more info feel free to post.  Thanks  Pepe"
561147,Handlebarz,2011-03-12 19:52:00,3790,If Ronnie sais stay home it must be a bad day for fishing like Wayne said he will drive anywhere just to have a shore lunch then head home
561171,esoxansteel,2011-03-12 21:39:00,1307,"Went to my office on Friday, the long way their via the Ganny, water was coming 2 feet over the dam, there was actually steelhead in the fenced off area where people stand at the ladder, the lower water was moving high dirty and extremely fast below the CNR, all other creeks were checked to Oshawa and were in the same condition. There are some options though check your pm      	And the post by Ron ill 3rd it as authentic and very much true"
561206,Ron,2011-03-12 23:26:00,1683,"Crippies!  What's this, pick on Ron day??? lol   Cheers, Ron...  Just for the record though, yes it was a 14 hr drive.... one way.... We did however put a couple of 43"" Pike and one almost legal Brookie in the boat in those 3 hrs of fishing! Don't ever believe Environment Canada when they forcasted 4k winds for the weekend and ended up with wind gust up to 90k!"
