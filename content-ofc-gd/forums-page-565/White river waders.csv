560592,misfish,2011-03-11 12:18:00,29133,  OK TY  Shouldnt you be fishing? LOL
560594,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-11 12:27:00,0,i owned a pair and they were comfy but i patched a lot of holes.
560596,solopaddler,2011-03-11 12:32:00,8605, We're leaving tonight. Bailed on today because of the weather.
560607,cuzza,2011-03-11 13:25:00,467,"I have a pair of White River waders and they seem decent enough especially for the price, I think they're s tep down from the ones in the flyer (based on the price).  I think the key is getting the right size, if they're tight, they'll hole more easily although if they're too big they'll rub."
560841,buckster,2011-03-12 00:01:00,530,I wouldn't bother with those waders even for free.   Lucky if you get a season out of them without any leaks.  
560842,misfish,2011-03-12 00:04:00,29133,Thanks all.
560948,Live2fish85,2011-03-12 03:40:00,1633,Thank you for asking that question Misfish I was going to get them Sunday when I go to bass pro shop but after seeing they're comments I think I am going to save my money now and wait.
