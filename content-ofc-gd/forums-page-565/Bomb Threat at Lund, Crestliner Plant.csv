According to the story, published yesterday, NY Mills Police Chief Jim Van Schaick explains “At 1:27 p.m., a 911 call was placed and a male caller said ‘There is a bomb in the factory,’ and hung up.” The building was evacuated immediately, and searched by police.  No bomb was found, and production resumed the following day.

It wouldn't have been pretty. It could force some people out of the dark ages though and into a proper boat. Jim"

560455,Roy,2011-03-11 01:00:00,13728,"A bomb threat is a cowardly, terrorist crime. While I understand some peoples' reaction to fear, I don't think it's really anything to joke about. But hey, that's just my opinion."
560539,tonka-toy,2011-03-11 03:35:00,139,I thought the jokes quite good and since no bomb was found i even laughed
560543,mercman,2011-03-11 03:46:00,7054,"I Think the point Roy was making, is that in this world we have become aclimatized to this type of thing happening every day, and that we should remember that an idle bomb threat is still that...a threat, and therfore a terrorist act."
