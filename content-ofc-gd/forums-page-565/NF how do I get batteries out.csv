561163,skinny,2011-03-12 20:35:00,442,ok my son found my big mag lite (I though it got tossed out long ago) anyway when I opened it up the old batteries are stuck in side and very corroded I have banged it had on a hard surface (with soft top) and still no budging. thinking of either putting a long screw into the batter and trying to pull it out or drilling the battery center out and colapsing the stuck battery.  looking or ideas or someone to tell me not to try the stuff I'm thinking
561166,bassjnkie,2011-03-12 20:56:00,1101,Happened to me a few years back with a 5 cell. I took off the light assembly carefully. You will be left with a tube with batteries in it. Put it in a vise and gently hammer out the batteries with a dowel. The tube will be full of acid and corrosion. For that I used a Dremel tool with a modified grinding bit and cleaned it out. If the contacts are corroded a piece of sandpaper will do the trick. Hope this helps.

561173,Muskieman,2011-03-12 21:44:00,2472,I put a wood screw into my batteries and pulled them out with pliers..  sprayed wd-40 on the inside and wiped it clean with paper towels and let it dry... dropped in new Duracell (14.00$  )batteries and it works like a charm. I love my Mag-Lite   Randy
