I usually clean, lube and maintain my own gear, but I might need a pro for these two reels.  I guess I have two questions.  1. Is there a place locally in the GTA where I can buy these bearings? 2. Is there a place locally in the GTA that's a top notch reel servicer?  Thanks."

560362,bdox,2011-03-10 20:35:00,329,"riverfisher is right, and the Boca Orange Seal are pretty well the best bearings you can get. I have them for my Calcutta TE100GT spool and they cast a country mile with a nice light lube."
560365,bigbuck,2011-03-10 20:37:00,2449,A Aikmann On Novar Rd. in Mississauga. You can either buy the bearings or have him service the reels.
560369,goteeboy,2011-03-10 20:40:00,175,Hey bdox Regarding the boca orange. do they require oil or no? thanks.
560373,bdox,2011-03-10 20:51:00,329,"Literally one drop of oil is all I put in mine, and that is good for the whole season. During the winter months I will take them out and soak them in lighter fluid, dry, and add a drop of oil. (make sure to remove the seal before soaking, as they are synthetic). The balls are ceramic hybrid, so they will never corrode."
560555,Garry2Rs,2011-03-11 04:51:00,1425,"If your reel uses the Shimano anti-rust bearings they are already about as good as it gets. A skilled reel mechanic can polish the working surfaces IE spool shaft etc. to make the reel even better.  Changing the bearings without a good polishing job might be just mental masturbation. I know a guy in Wistuffa Kansas who is very good, but it means mailing the reel to the USA... PM me if you want details. Garry2R's"
