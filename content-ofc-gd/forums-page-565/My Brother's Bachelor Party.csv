We drove down to Florida and stayed in Orlando. The morning of the cruise we went fishing with a bass guide on Lake Toho and got into some largemouth bass. The area had had a cold front not too long ago, which shut down the fish.  Using golden shiners, we were still able to get some fish.  Here are some pics.       And of course, this 9 lb monster!    It was a great time, punctuated by a Florida giant!  Hope you liked the pics."
