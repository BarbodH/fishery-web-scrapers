My heart goes out to Japan!"
560685,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 17:10:00,5865, The Ark thing is MUCH more complicated now a days.....if you collect 2 of each animal and one is gay does that count....just saying....not that there's anything wrong with that.....  BTW it would take 80 days and 80 nights of rain because now we have sewers...LOL

560705,Governator,2011-03-11 18:25:00,879,"Our world is falling a part, I'm just so thankful to be here.  Such a sad state of affairs.  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks and civil wars.  Japan earthquake/tsunami, Indonesia tsunami, Haiti quake, hurricane Katrina, hurricane from south asia a few years ago, plenty more of course.  From hurricanes to quakes & tsunamis, milllions have died over the past decade.  We have wars all over the globe right now too in Afghanistan, Iraq, & civil wars in the Middle East that need international aid too."

560794,Jer,2011-03-11 21:44:00,1426,"   The more things change...the more they stay the same.  These things have always happened...and always will. The sky is not falling. Fewer people die in war today than at anytime during the past century. In the 30's we had Stalin, 40's we had WWII, 50's we had Korea, 60's we had Viet Nam, in the 70's there was blood shead all over the Middle East in numerous wars and Idi Amin and Pol Pot in other parts of the world.  Storms, earthquakes and volcanoes have always plagued humankind, even wiping out entire civilizations at times of history.  It really isn't anything new..."
560810,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 22:31:00,5865, What's NEW is we have 24/7 New Channels that are run by Liberals....so to them it's always doom and gloom.....plus it sells....
560811,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 22:32:00,5865, You got that right....LOL.....  :rofl2:
560820,Jer,2011-03-11 22:55:00,1426,"   Unfortunately, it doesn't really matter the political stripe...you're right though, the doom & gloom sells and the hyper news cycle leads to information overload.  It's obviously a terrible situation in Japan, and we all should be concerned for those affected, but the world will go on."
560825,ah_long,2011-03-11 23:06:00,354,"hey guys, rmb when millions of fish just died off Redondo Beach in LA... the two events are so close in terms of time frame, it's just eerie.."

560997,lew,2011-03-12 12:53:00,12766,It's terrible what's happening in Japan and it just seems to keep getting worse.
561005,OhioFisherman,2011-03-12 13:25:00,6623,"They shouldn`t have messed with Godzilla! Ya sad to see, there is a reason that area is called the ring of fire though."
561021,fishing n autograph,2011-03-12 13:54:00,2540,i guess it was Japan's turn....the ring of fire has seen devastation forever...it just hasn't really happened on our side of the pond too often...
561042,HTHM,2011-03-12 15:00:00,4082,"Watching the news, I realize that getting out on the water is not as important as we think."
561079,Twocoda,2011-03-12 16:49:00,4130,I think the OP should change the name of this thread to Japan Devastation....now the are verging on a nuclear meltdown...my brother inlaw was in Tokyo last week ...there is a large sigh of relief he is back in Korea right now...

561091,Live2fish85,2011-03-12 17:14:00,1633,Yea this Tragedy mother nature throw at us really makes you think. I hope that's it for them now. I really think a lot of people realize how good we have it in Canada we have our storms but I couldn't Imagine something like that.
561092,Cookslav,2011-03-12 17:14:00,1457,"Its just getting warmed up... The death toll will take weeks to finalize, some islands, and costal towns have not even been checked on yet. And worse yet...if that nuclear reactor goes they are pooched. They already had an explosion this morning in trying to cool the reactors with sea water (hydrogen based explosion) And it failed so now its a ticking time bomb right now. Evacuation area is 20km around the area....I think I'd be going as far away as possible if it were me.  One of my Best freinds linves in Nagoya and was spared the veroctiy of this event being he's on the other side of the Island....luck of the draw i guess. Fourtunate for him and his family...but not so much for many."
561130,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-12 19:04:00,3761,"text Asia to 30333, it automatically will donate $5 to the red cross. I read this off of City News last night a few times. It's not much but hey at least ""technology"" makes it easy to help.  A true devastation and something we will never be able to know what it feels like. Never."
561135,Twocoda,2011-03-12 19:12:00,4130, Darlington is on  fault line ....so NEVER say Never
561146,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-12 19:52:00,3761," I didn't know that but my point here is we do not know what it would be like to be in there shoes right now, we have never had a disaster that compares to there situation...Not going to argue it's a waste of time. Let's just hope for the best and see our government put some money to them.  MTBF"
560570,BUSTER,2011-03-11 08:54:00,1336,Wow biggest ever  and a tsunami....
560571,lew,2011-03-11 09:36:00,12766,I'm watching the news now and it looks like they got hammered by that 7 meter wave with all the buildings and cars being swept away like toys. Sounds like there's even bigger waves heading for other locations too.
560572,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-11 09:37:00,1107,I just read that google has a warning on their home page crazy stuff going on
560580,chefboi17,2011-03-11 10:51:00,128,watching the news cast of the tsunami is tough. seeing the cars driving down the road and getting completely blind sided by the wall of debris and water was hard to see. very scary stuff. it seems like the frequency of large earthquakes is increasing world wide too.
560586,OhioFisherman,2011-03-11 11:51:00,6623,"Tsunami watch out for Hawaii and the west coast of US, Mex, and Canada. Heck aftershocks of 7.0? that`s a good quake on it`s own."

560593,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 12:25:00,5865,Just another challenge mother nature throws our way.....you never know what you will wake up to some days...
560597,fishing n autograph,2011-03-11 12:35:00,2540,Wow...at least Japan was ready for it. Apparantly the BBC news was saying that the best place in the world to be during and earthquake and tsunami is japan. There emergency preparedness is beyond any other country. Everyone who has a cell phone gets a notification that an earthquake is coming...  Its sad though. I wonder who is next? The entire pacific rim is under a warning
560601,Muskieman,2011-03-11 12:50:00,2472,"Ya gotta feel for everyone affected by this quake and tsunami.. You also gotta wonder when the ""BIG ONE"" will hit our west coast seems that it's well overdue... hoping that it won't happen in our lifetime but it isn't looking good.   Randy "

560619,oldphart,2011-03-11 14:03:00,665,"~~~Yea everyone laughed at the Mayan's and their calendar, but with the Mid-East in turmoil, changing weather patterns, more active volcanoes, and this massive tsunami, this could be a wake up call. But what are we to do? Build and Ark??"
560634,fishing n autograph,2011-03-11 14:55:00,2540, I'm thinkin there are a few ofners that still have the original plans for noahs ark lol

Japan- terrible news!!!!!!!!! i hope the casualty numbers are not staggering...
