560355,Cosmos,2011-03-10 20:25:00,588,Boat was on the same spot since last fall - never got any issue until now. Will move it to garage for now to prevent any problems.
560364,smally21,2011-03-10 20:37:00,993,"there are height limitations too, 8'6"" in alot of places. i had a customer pay me to cut the top of of his bayliner cruiser to meet storage requirements!"
560938,John Bacon,2011-03-12 03:25:00,3277, What exactly has to be less than 5.2m?  My boat is less then 5.2m; my boat and motor combined are probably over 5.2m; the entire rig from back of the motor to front of the trailer is definitely over 5.2 metres.  I haven't had any complaints so far but I would like to know where I stand if an issue comes up.
560950,Dara,2011-03-12 03:47:00,3052,WoW  a man can't even park his boat at the house now...gotta have something to do with wimmin
560964,Uncle Buck,2011-03-12 05:18:00,1000, Can i park my boat on your front Lawn?
560999,Billy Bob,2011-03-12 12:57:00,5865, You can on my lawn.....only problem.....it might not be there when you need it......
561025,Handlebarz,2011-03-12 14:10:00,3790,I had this problem years ago when I first started driving transport I had no house so I would just pop into mom and dads when I was in town every 2-4 weeks and use that as my home for the time being. I would bring the truck home after 10am and only for the days I was not leaving early in the am. I had a city guy come over due to a compliant about the truck being there I was looking at the same driveway as him and asked if he could see the truck he said NO I then told him it only comes here to be cleaned out and if I am getting home later in the day and not leaving early so I did not bother the neighbors. He gave me a warning anyway even thought he did not see the truck there but had 1 compliant. two weeks later I was cleaning out my truck in the drive way and a local cop showed up due to a complaint and asked me in a funny manner his words (you dident just drive your truck up this road did you???) I was puzzled and he asked again but this time he was shaking his head side to side trying to get me to understand him I answered NO Sir I did not he was relieved and said He had to ask me and hopes that I am not leaving when he passes through the street or he would have to stop me due to the compliant.  This OLD BIRD is not long dead but before she could she had one last stand with our neighbor hood she called the cops as she did daily or at least weekly on Bull stuff but this last one was the best new people had moved in and were having one Heck of a party the cops showed up and were looking to have a great time dad said as they went to bust a retirement party for a cop non the less the party did not stop.  Sorry for the long read I guess I was just trying to say there are    in every neighborhood.
559562,Cosmos,2011-03-08 18:14:00,588,"Hi everybody,  I bought a boat last fall and parked the trailer with a boat close to my townhouse doors (I am living in the corner unit) leaving space to park my cars. Today, unfortunatelly i wasn't at home, some guy showed up saying that he got a complain from somebody in the area about boat standing in front of the house. He said that boat must be removed in 2 weeks or i will get ticket. I need some advise - i don't really know what to do actually. I can't understand what is the problem. Does it mean that during summer time i won't be able to keep my boat in front of my own place?  Any advises will be really appreciated.  Thanks."
559566,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-08 18:28:00,390,These are great questions and I would suggest you speak with whomever administrates your local bylaws in order to get the right answers.  
559567,xpedx789,2011-03-08 18:30:00,11,"Unfortunatly that is exactly what will happen...Lots of cities will not permit you to park a boat in your drive , or even in the front or side of your home...It usually goes unnoticed untill some busy body gets a bug up their rump and turns you in...Couple suggestions. Do you have one of those storage places in your area where people rent a small garage ? Sometimes they ares where you can store large items like RV's or boats..Also, when summer does come, you will be allowed to have it in your drive if you make it look like you are working on it...Most cities will allow you to have it there for a reasonable amount of time if your repairing it, or if looks like you are repairing it...*wink* Last option is to just dock it if you can afford it...Hope this helps!"
559568,HTHM,2011-03-08 18:31:00,4082,"Check the bylaws of your condo corporation, typically they do not allow storge of boats or unused cars for longer than two weeks."
559569,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-08 18:31:00,4399,"A lot of jurisdictions have by-laws regarding the parking of,boats,motorhomes,transports etc. on residential lots and I can understand why. I will use this as an example back in a previous sub division I lived in there was a guy that would park his large moving truck in his driveway and of course start the noisy diesel up at 4:30 am disturbing everybody especially in the summer time when everybody has there windows open,on my old street in Shelburne there was a guy that stored his RV in his driveway and it blocked the side walk forcing people including kids and mothers with strollers out onto the street.And that is why they have by-laws because you know there will be some guy that will want to park his RV, his boat his snowmobile and his ice hut on his front lawn!!! I have on occassion left my boat in my driveway for a few days at a time with no problems but all it takes is one phone call to end that."
559570,Cosmos,2011-03-08 18:33:00,588,Thank you guys for quick response. I will try to contact that person who was at my place today. I just found out that he left his bussiness card. In the main time i will have to figure out something.
559598,Pikeslayer,2011-03-08 20:46:00,1443, Call 311 (from your home phone). That is your city's hundred million billion dollar customer information hotline. You should be able to get an answer over the phone. Or at least you might be entertained  Slayer
559617,pics,2011-03-08 21:49:00,1268,"I'm glad to live in an area just outside the city where I can put my pop up, boat and utility trailer in my driveway. I don't like being told what to do on my own property... I keep things neat, not junky though....."
559623,aniceguy,2011-03-08 22:25:00,1094,pretty simple rule thats generally in all by laws in the province of Ontario any trailerable object more then 5.2 m in length can only remain on your dirveway for no more then 72 hrs per calander month.  An RV that is driveable can remain on the driveway regardless of size ( as I was explained In mississiauga) I had the call on my 6.5 m boat and now have a 10k extension of the garage to house it in the works.... I know who complained and they will get thier just desserts
559633,perchslayer666,2011-03-08 23:00:00,280,"It's a lot easier  to store your boat at a remote access facility, where you can go anytime you want to pick-up your boat.... Sucks, but unless you can store it in your garage your outta luck.  It's Bull, but if your neighbor hadn't seen it, someone else will and complain about it....  If I were you I'd host Hell's Angels meetings at your place on a weekly basis and then no one will mess with you. Plus you might get some nice extras out of it..."

559924,pics,2011-03-09 17:26:00,1268,"I don't hear too much about this problem just outside of Hamilton but in the new Binbrook subdivisions there seems to be a lot of rules on what you can put in your driveway, not to mention satelite dishes, clothes lines and older cars etc..whatever dosen't ""fit"" with the neighborhood standards....status symbols seem to be ok though..."
559925,Cosmos,2011-03-09 17:26:00,588,  What if the boat with trailer is less then 5.2 m?

I beliive that the new council and Mayor, have decided that a drive way is a driveway and that as long as you stay within the boundries of a lawful drive, you can do what you want with it. HH"

Where I had it wasn't really on the lawn but it wasn't on the driveway neither, it was like a landscaped area with stone paving. Either way I was told you can only park your boat inside the garage.  So I ended up moving it into the garage and make my parents park one of their cars outside. I may have to sell it since we're getting another car soon"

Ihad the boat in the back yard and got complained. Now the boat is in the back yard with pato stones under the tires, no complains yet for over a year. Screw this neighbor."
