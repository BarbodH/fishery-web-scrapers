When a user gets out of hand and posts things that they should not, they are given a warning, and told to think about what they post before they submit.  If they can't manage to contain themselves, and continue to post things that we find offensive, then they get put on""ModQ"". This means that they can still post and when a moderator gets the time, someone will read the post and either approve or dissaprove it. If the user can maintain some sort of sensibility in their posts this restriction is eventually removed and life goes on. Seems pretty fair to me.  So while on ModQ you can post away, but they won't likely be visible right away. Berating a moderator is a great way to make sure that the stay on ModQ is longer. And if you can't handle being on ModQ, I'm sure there are plenty of other fourms around for you to go sully. Some dont think this is fair, and that's fine as well. Nobody is being forced to be here."
