We set up some lines and waited... first fish was a Smalleye and went back... so were the second and third ...hmmm  Then a Perch and another...hmmm  Then a little Ling.  finally a good hit..17.5"" Walleye..  and then another few Smalleyes...  needless to say I came home empty handed and soaking wet but had fun nonetheless. Total count...8 Walleye , 2 Perch and a Ling in about 2.5 hours  Besides, I needed an escape from my wife ,for when she got home to find a 2037.66$ HYDRO BILL/62 days of usage.  on the kitchen table .  :wallbash:      Randy "
560477,Rod Caster,2011-03-11 01:49:00,5784,Right on!  
560480,Nipfisher,2011-03-11 01:52:00,2449,8 walleye in a couple hours is good. Why the Goose Islands? I thought you were heading to Blueberry Island in the mouth of the French?
560484,Bernie,2011-03-11 01:56:00,3190,Nice to see you pick up a couple Randy.
560485,Muskieman,2011-03-11 01:59:00,2472," We went out to my buds shack ... where we could have shelter from the rain , we took the chance of missing out on lunkers vs maybe catching a few legal limits... Nipissing won this time 'round but I'll head out on Saturday when I have more than a few hours and try a few spots around the mouth by Brown Island and Franks Point."
560492,Nipfisher,2011-03-11 02:04:00,2449, We'll have to try that area together this spring with my boat. I'd like to mark a few drop-offs and shoals with my HDS and then visit them in the winter.
560498,Muskieman,2011-03-11 02:20:00,2472,for sure Blair!!

560677,highdrifter,2011-03-11 16:31:00,2534,Nice going bud.  What's up with your bill?!  Ch'pensais que tu chauffais au bois!!
560781,Muskieman,2011-03-11 21:18:00,2472, Last year's big winter bill ( I heat with Hydro) was 750.00$ this winter was much warmer than last winter so I assumed I used less energy... but my bill just about tripled?  I have no idea why.. come Monday they're sending a technician to inspect my house for faulty grounds that may be the reason for the hike?
