He put them in the bed of his pickup truck and was about to drive home when he was confronted by an ornery Conservation Officer who didn't like Newfies.  The Conservation Officer ordered the Newfie to show his hunting license, and the Newfie pulled out a valid Ontario hunting license.  The Conservation Officer looked at the license, then reached over and picked up one of the ducks, sniffed its   , and said, 'This duck ain't from Ontario.  This is a Quebec duck.  You got a Quebec huntin' license, boy?'  The Newfie reached into his wallet and produced a Quebec hunting license.  The Conservation Officer looked at it, then reached over and grabbed the second duck, sniffed its   , and said, 'This ain't no Quebec duck.  This duck's from Manitoba.  You got a Manitoba license?'  The Newfie reached into wallet and produced a Manitoba hunting license.  The Officer then reached over and picked up the third duck, sniffed its     , and said, 'This ain't no Manitoba duck.  This here duck's from Nova Scotia.  You got a Nova Scotia huntin' license?'  Again the Newfie reached into his wallet and brought out a Nova Scotia hunting license.  The Conservation Officer was extremely frustrated at this point, and he yelled at the Newfie, 'Just where the hell are you from?'  The Newfie turned around, bent over, dropped his pants, and said, 'You tell me, you're the expert.'"
