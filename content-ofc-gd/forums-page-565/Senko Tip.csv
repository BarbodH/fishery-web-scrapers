560462,bucktail,2011-03-11 01:22:00,1857,"Just a quick little fact that popped into my head after reding about Gary Yamamoto baits on sale at LeBarons.  The exact center of gravity of a Gary Yamamoto   senko is 7 ribs to the middle of the egg sac. I think I picked this up on Jarrett Edwards fisihng show , not sure but really handy! Not usre if its true for clone baits but interesting enough. I was spring cleaning my brain and found this tip!!!   Darren"

560529,SlowPoke,2011-03-11 03:13:00,2984,Have you found this to be true for all sizes?
560551,4x4bassin,2011-03-11 04:25:00,1025,"Thanks , good to know"
560558,EC1,2011-03-11 06:27:00,930,"Sorry if this sounds dumb, but should I be wacky rigging right at the centre of gravity? I've been doing it at the smooth part of it all of last season.  And let me contribute a bit (Although I'm pretty sure most of you guys know it). If you are fishing senkos/imitations deep and don't want to wait, you can wacky rig with a jighead, which gives a different action too. You guys can look up flick shake on youtube, and they have a different plastic by jackall-BPS has a good imitation for half the price. These worms have slight bends in them.  Instead of shaking a tight line, shake your rig with a bow on your line. the jighead becomes the pivot point and a whole different action is made."
561202,hirk,2011-03-12 23:20:00,571,were you hook it depends on what you want it to do.Good to know where to hook it for neutral fall though.
