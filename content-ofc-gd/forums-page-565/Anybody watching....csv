Few days ago they were showing another Les miserables on PBS.  Colm Wilkinson, Canadian singer looks old without his makeup on. I heard he will be in town soon to promote his CD and two day show.  Never got tired of that Broadway show! Only saw it live twice.  PBS was showing the HIT MAN few days ago, David Foster was bringing back famous singers from the 80's and 90's together with today's famous singer all in one concert. Saw Donna Summer singing with Seal. This is the third series on Hit Man, Good concept, reviving the oldies.  I got a DVD of it."
