560659,fishing n autograph,2011-03-11 15:32:00,2540,Hanging out with my 3 year old daughter....   Since the weather is really bad down here I decided that my little one and I would curl up and watch a few Disney Classics until its time to go to Nana's and eat pancakes for a belated pancake Tuesday...  My wife is away for the next 7 days and we're home alone and bonding over the March Break!  I cherish these moments since I'm not around as much as I'd like to be...and she's growing faster than I could ever imagine!  Have a good one guys!

560945,jediangler,2011-03-12 03:34:00,1923,I loved my time as Mr.Mom as well. Too bad it doesn't pay more or I would do it full-time. Time speeds up drastically once you have a little one around. Taking mine to the Niagara Outdoors Show tomorrow.  http://www.niagaraoutdoorshow.com/  We'll also stop to check out the falls as my 10yr old thinks the only thing in Niagara Falls is Marineland.
