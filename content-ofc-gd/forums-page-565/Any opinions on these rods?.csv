If you are a Lake Ontario salmon fisherman I would think the longer 2 would make a pretty good rod for running dipsey divers with braid line or if you add a twili tip with wire, the diameter at the tip would make them too stiff for me anyway in a downrigger. Could make a muskie trolling rod I guess but no experience with that."
560954,Dara,2011-03-12 03:58:00,3052,Its a 50 dollar glass rod. Pick it up and feel the action. Then pick up the 40 dollar eagle claw and take what you like best for the money.  I always hated that yellow sticking up behind the salmon trollers though...maybe if it was green or brown
