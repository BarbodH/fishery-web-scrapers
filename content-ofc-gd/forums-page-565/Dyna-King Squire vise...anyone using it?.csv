560766,cuzza,2011-03-11 20:36:00,467,"Well the Dyna-King is around $175 and there's plenty to go at in that range. Do you need a rotary?  FWIW I was in Bass Pro at the weekend and the Peak rotary the have seems like a nice solid piece of kit and is $160, I ended up with a Terra Silverado for $50 as I don't need rotary and can't justify spending loads on a vice that won't see that much use.  Did a quick Google on the Dyna King and it gets good reviews (all their stuff is good) so if you like it and it's in budget, go for it"
560775,FishTracker,2011-03-11 21:03:00,47," The rotation ability is definitely a nice addition.  I'm currently using a kit vise without that functionality to tie all my flies.  I hope to upgrade the least amount of times as possible so I'm looking for something that will suit me for many years to come.  What I like about the Squire is the pedestal base (although optional on many vises), and legendary grip.  The owner of a local shop told me he has had his Squire for nearing 20 years and still loves it!  It just seems hard to justify the price for a piece of steel"
