560830,GBW,2011-03-11 23:39:00,8460,"As per the title, what are your thoughts on these Abu Garcia Vendetta Trigger Rods? I'm thinking the 7' M or 7' MH for crankbaits and jerkbaits. Thanks in advance. Geoff"
560877,Gregoire,2011-03-12 01:07:00,1397,"There was a post about these rods recently. I was at gagnon's the other day and picked one up and it felt nice and light. I own one as well, and find it a bit stiff"
560883,ah_long,2011-03-12 01:18:00,354,"they are nice.. but to me, they're not as refined as a Shimano Compre...  on the side note, I also find the Veritas tip heavy as well"
560885,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-12 01:19:00,3761,love there looks and design...too bad it's a abu

560895,GBW,2011-03-12 01:52:00,8460,"I'm looking for the 7' M or MH action for trolling in the tinny or casting jerkbaits.  TKS!  TKS  TKS for the review!   One thing to keep in mind is, this is a back-up rod so that is why the price point is where it is.  I don't want to spend more then $100 on a rod for it to sit in my boat and or boathouse unused.  Cheers.  Geoff"
560900,Gregoire,2011-03-12 02:04:00,1397,"what species are you targeting? These rods run about 80 bucks. If you can get 20 bucks off, as shimano seems to be offering as a trade in rebate why not try a compre?"
560952,ah_long,2011-03-12 03:50:00,354,the compre has a lifetime warranty as well
560956,Dara,2011-03-12 04:06:00,3052,"The last Abu I got, when my kids were 9 and 12 they used to fight over it. My daughter at 12 generally won and my son had to use it."

561048,Gregoire,2011-03-12 15:17:00,1397, I prefer a really stiff rod for jerk and crank baits so the vendetta might work. Depending on your preference you may find this rod too stiff. From what I have read a lot of people seem to prefer a softer rod for the techniques you mentioned.
561090,GBW,2011-03-12 17:13:00,8460,"looks like I will have to test out a few when I get the reel to see what's a nice fit then.  as for the compre, I don't have anything to trade in right now to save me the $20."
561190,Rombo,2011-03-12 23:03:00,39,"Just bought one at bass pro. 6'6"" med. It is a little stiff but should suit my needs.  Now just need some soft water, hopefully next weekend!!!"
