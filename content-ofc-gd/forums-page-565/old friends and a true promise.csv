Huddled up in the no smoking section lighting up fireworks and smokes and having a great laugh, for the teachers to be sort of entertained juring lunch hour. .  Do you recall the promisary notes that you told your buds, if that in the future if you need anything, Im here for you.  20 or so yrs later, that did come to life and as promised to him. Delivery in two days and I hope he sleeps well, hes going to need it! 5 kids, a house and a divorce. And its not his fault by any means! A futton bed is on its way for my old friend  I just wanted to share this with all of you And another apple may have fallen very close to this particular situation"
