241249,keram,2008-08-19 15:00:00,585,"After hauling the tent trailer home, I've hooked up the boat  . We've rented the cottage on one of Kawarthas lake. I was warned by the owner of the marina that the fishing is slow due to unusual abundance of bait fish.. And he was right. The only fish I've landed was between 9-9:30 pm on shoals around this island.    Average size    The shoals around the island occupied me for a whole week At sunset   Just before sunset    And in the fog    Finally the island was claimed by my daugters after lengty( about 5 min )  voyage on the paddle boat   Again the dogs had lots of fun  Couple more scenery shots   "

241298,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-19 16:22:00,0,Great report. Good to hear you got some dinner! Thats usually the magic hour in the Kawarthas. The 1/2 hour before dark. The lake looks nice and calm. Thanks for sharing.

241552,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 13:13:00,8163,Nice report and pics Keram!!!  I just knew we were going to see some action pics of the homemade lures in this report  ... maybe next time eh?
241617,keram,2008-08-20 15:35:00,585," I was hopeing for this too Glen  The lake did not hold Muskies, but I did not waste time at all. Did some ""fine tuning""   of the lures, to make them run the way I like. the quality of the clips is not perfect, but you can get an idea. Just keep in mind that for the recording purposes they are on a pretty short ""leash"" (about 5 yards). In reality they can go much deeper. (it depends on the trolling speed)    And when the rain was pouring like he$$, with very limited   tooling I've carved some more.   Just need to make them look ""nice"""
241639,ehg,2008-08-20 17:14:00,2666,"Nice walleye  I guess you caught more walleye than that one? That island seems to be a main feature of that lake. Nice variety of conditions in the pictures, ehg"
