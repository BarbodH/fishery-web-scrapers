241678,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-20 19:10:00,0,"OK, today must be my luckiest day ever in my life  One co-worker who I rarely talk to ask me whether I go steelheading or not all of the sudden. Apparently, he has not tried it before since no one he knows does.  Not only that he also wants to try salmon fishing .. so I promise him that I will show him the rope if he is into river & shore fishing (I dont have a boat ... as you guys know already)  Out of nowhere, he mentioned he has a boat (jeez, now you know how rarely I talk to him) and wonder if WE can catch salmons from the boat!  OH YEAH OH YEAH OFCOURSE! -------------------- I said  The plan is to go either this weekend OR the one after due to the fact that he has to spend time with the family ..  I would like to know where those Lake-O salmons are at now so that I can place my bet accordingly!  Any advices are WELCOME!  OH YEAH ~ BOAT SALMON FISH! no more sore-arm-spoon-casting!"
