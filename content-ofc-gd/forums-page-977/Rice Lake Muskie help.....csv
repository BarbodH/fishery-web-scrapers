From what I can gather is a more shallow lake with a lot of weeds.  I have heard that the South end should be my main focus, but I really have no idea.  Never been out on the water here so I was just wondering if anyone had any tips for hitting this body of water.  No need for honey holes or anything, but a general location to focus my efforts on would be great!  Thanks for the help,  MuskieWannabe"
