241193,Andy,2008-08-19 12:33:00,330,"When the kids were younger, we camped at a number of provincial parks, and our favorites were Arrowhead and Grundy. It's been a number of years since I've been. I do recall we had our bikes up there to ride the trails. I thought the beach was good for a shield lake. (Anyone else notice all the sand in the area when they are working on the roads?) We took our canoes and in the evening had great bass action (small fish) near the reeds across from the beach. There is a second small lake we explored as well. Huntsville is close by if you need supplies. Hope this helps. Like I said earlier, it was one of our favorites. Andy"
