The saugeen was unfishable due to high water levels and my daughter was so looking to fishing even at 6 months pregnant so we decided to fish Wilmer ponds for a fun day.. This place is loaded with rainbows,browns,brookies and even has a bass pond!! there are 20 ponds with fish there...When we were there they were working on a pond with their heavy equip .. Awesome place to bring the family for a fun day and the owner is a super lady.. Full of information on what to use and what ponds to fish..I highly recommend this place.. We ended up with 10 bows 12"" and up and although we didn't get into the huge ones we sure seen some that were really big.. Fishing there can be tough in the summer but spring and fall is best according to the owner.. check this place out... http://www.ontario-fishing-ponds.com/  here are a few pics of our vacation  this pic is the sign you look for off highway 6 one mile north of Durham..   my son concentrating on getting a few    the reason my daughter couldn't hit the saugeen for a long hike   what to expect for fishing....   the sign from the barn off highway 6   my sons way of saying he had fun ....
