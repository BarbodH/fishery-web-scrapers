Pulled out this guy using a small spinner bait.    Had about 3 more hits but couldn't connect with the fish. Moved to the next spot...Kings bay. Tossing senkos and Flukes again had several boils but kept missing fish on the hookset. Next came the bluebird skies and the fishing seemed to slow down for a few hours. Later in the day working a weed flat with spinner baits we had some cloud cover come in. We could'nt keep the rockbass of the hook. Curt was catching some with really fat bellies on em. Then he got into this decent largie.    Now on to another area with lots of thick slop. Fishing was now on fire. Fishing blowing up on the baits everywhere. Bass jumping all around us.
