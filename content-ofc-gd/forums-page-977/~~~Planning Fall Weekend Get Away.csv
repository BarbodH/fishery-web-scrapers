Cottages are $99/day for 2 bedrooms which has bunkbeds in the second room so can sleep 3 to 4 people if you include the pull out couch.  3 bdrm is $125/day  There is camping too but no running water after September for the campsites.  The lake has walleye, bass, pike, and lake trout.  If we can get enough interest then we might be able to get some sort of discount.  The trip will be in late October or early November.
