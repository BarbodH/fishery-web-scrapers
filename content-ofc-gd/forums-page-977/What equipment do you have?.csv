241535,ccmtcanada,2008-08-20 12:49:00,7971,"Our first watercraft was a 14' canoe....donated by fellow OFNer Basskicker....we use it for small marshes, or protected bays where no boat launches are nearby.  We got this in the summer of 2007.   Our first ever fishing boat (bought in Oct of 2007) is a 1983 14' Sea Nymph, with a 1983 Merc 18hp.   Truth be told though....our biggest fish have been caught from shore....probably because we are still learning to fish from a boat....or maybe it's cause we just suck at it....LOL."
