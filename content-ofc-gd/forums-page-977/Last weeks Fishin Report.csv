Mon. was on the water by 06:00 and did a scouting run to different spots and checked for hits, which was a few little smallies and lotsa rockers. 10:00 came in, had a bite to eat, started on a few chores and about noon the thunder and rain started and didn't stop till morning. Tue. afternoon Darren (Dutch on OFC) rolled in, after a little chat and a bite to eat we headed out, but after the storms it was pretty tough fishing.  Darren started out with his first ever Pike.  (have to mention Dutch is 25 feet tall)  Then I hit this slab crappie jigging for pickeral.   Woke up Wed. morning to the sound of lashing rain, back to sleep till about 08:00, had some breakfast, watch some Olympics and around 10ish it looked like the rain was stopping so we grabbed the rain gear, pumped out the boat and we are off. Started off deep trolling around shoals but after an hour or so nota. The weather was breaking so I suggested running up the river and use the electric coming back, as I was reeling in from the troll this one hit.    It was a nice ride down the river but not much action, mostly rockbass, did catch a pan sized pickeral and tried that area for another hour or so but only the one (cleaned it straight from the livewell forgot a pic). Caught a few small bass at the mouth, here's a couple pic's of the average sized fish we were getting into.      Most of the catches came from rock with a bit of weed around so we headed to a string of shoals wth a small island the had a good drop off. I started with a spinnerbait then changed to a jig, had a real good one on but lost'em, retied again. After a bit another good hookup, this time I had'em was a decent size pike, a few jumps and pulling drag, when I got him to the side of the boat the line was wrapped around his bottom jaw and was just about to glove him, tall dance, retied again. Darren was leaving after the evening fish so we head in to chow down.  After dinner we headed to another river mouth with a rockie dropoff and was hitting small ones, moved around the point and into a calm bay. I switched to top water and that when it started. First one missed and went clean over the lure, Darren through his senko to the area and came back with this one.   Then he changed to a top water as well and for the next 45 minutes it was none stop till dark. These river smallies were strong and bulldoged to the boat all the way. This one in the next picture bent the split ring and landed on the deck.    Didn't stop from the action for many pictures but Darren did get a nice 4 pounder which would not give up.  And the last one for the night.   Darren it was good to fish with you again and I enjoyed your company, hope you had a good time and we'll have to do it again.  Needed to get caught up on chores so didn't fish till Fri. and did all right but no trophy and had to leave early Sat. All in all it was a good week, ya had to work for the fish but thats what it's about I guess..."
240800,Leecher,2008-08-18 13:44:00,7832,Great report and pics b2kptbo  Real nice smallies for sure  Thanks for sharing Leechman
240815,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-18 14:29:00,0,Thanks for the report. Sounds like a great lake with a lot of different species. Its been a tough season with the big ones in hiding! Looks like you did ok! Thanks for sharing.
241412,Dutch,2008-08-19 23:06:00,831,"Good being out on the lake with ya, definitely have to do it again.  Nice being up there during the week - not as much boat traffic and the lake was just like glass.  That topwater action was the best I've had in a long time - those fish were coming up from 15+ feet and just hammering them.  B2K is being a bit modest on that slab - it was 14+ inches and real thick across the back.  Biggest I've seen, the picture doesn't do it justice.  I'm glad I got my PB pike - nowhere to go but up I guess.  We also had a visitor - a young raccoon made an appearance by the patio about midnight and stuck around for about 5 minutes - quite comical, I think people must have been feeding it as it definitely wasn't shy - got within 2-3 feet.  Also saw a ""flying"" squirrel for the first time.  All-in-all a great couple of days."

241510,ccmtcanada,2008-08-20 12:00:00,7971,"Great report!  The great thing about catching a pike that sized for your first one, is that PB's will come pretty quickly!!"
