My bud from across the pond called and said he was going up to his favorite fishin' hole today, so, even though I won't be doin' any carp fightin', nothing says I can't watch. The Brit landed about 5 & Rodpoly another 3 . . .     I got a chance to play a couple of 'em for a few minutes, but didn't push my luck.  The first one was small . . .     10  -  12 pounds, but did splash around the surface, and made good account of itself.    Steve finally got 'im under control, and he was soon in the net . . . . . .  .     And soon was on his way, to fight another day.    The day was PERFECT . . .    the bite was steady, the fish good & healthy . . .     no sign of any more of the 'carp plague,' but over-all, not very big."

We met for the first time on Eastport several years ago. You showed me how to tie a hair rig. I am now the provincial chairman. Beans regularly posts on our forum. What happened to your eye. I wish you a speedy recovery. Great post, nice pictures."
