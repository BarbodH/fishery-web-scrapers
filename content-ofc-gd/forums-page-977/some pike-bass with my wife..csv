This is usually non-stop action on topwaters and mepps spinners but was relatively slow yesteday. We caught some fish , but the usual fish a cast was not on yesterday. It has been getting colder here in the mornings, and despite the high temperatures in the afternoons it was definitely chilly on the way out at 11am....should only be about 8 weeks before first safe ice for fishing is here  ...anyway...here's some pics and vid from yesterdays outing.    FIRST CAST, FIRST PIKE.....HAD TO APOLOGISE FOR ALMOST HITTING MY WIFE WITH THE ROD WHEN SETTING THE HOOK.....OOOOPS!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1800.flv"">      I MANAGED TO CAST A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO SHORE AND SPENT 10 MINUTES ON SHORE RETRIEVING THE LURE              COULD NOT HELP HAVING A RUMMAGE AROUND WHILE I WAS THERE, AND FOUND THIS LITTLE CRAYFISH             AFTER OUR SHORE DETOUR MY WIFE HOOKED INTO THE BEST SMB OF THE DAY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1809.flv"">    WE HAD A FEW MORE 1 AND 2 POUNDERS       AND SOME PIKE.........ALL MEDIUM TO SMALL SIZE              AND SOME VERY SMALL        AND A BLUE/SILVER PIKE        All in all an enjoyable few hours on the water , but the fishing was slow....i did get a couple small walleye on the way home, but they went back as we've been eating a lot of fish recently."
241584,goodtimer,2008-08-20 14:18:00,53,Thanks for the report...hopefully fishing heats up a bit for when i head your way in a couple weeks.  The reflections on the fish look wild....cool shot.

At first glance, thought it was a bass head only and was waiting for you to say that a big pike had come up and chewed the body off of it  I looked at it again and it's just the way the shot was taken  Again great job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
