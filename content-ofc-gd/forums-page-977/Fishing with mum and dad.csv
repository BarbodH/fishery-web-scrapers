240907,limeyangler,2008-08-18 18:25:00,5204,"Hi Y'all,  After moving from England to Canada just over a year ago my Mum and Dad finally made it over from England to visit us. We did spend a couple of days with them in South Haven, Michigan before the long and tiresome drive back up to Northwestern Ontario.  Never again will I take the route through Illinois, and Wisconsin and Minnesota, because despite being some 300kms shorter than the drive up through Michigan to Sault St. Marie and round Lake Superior through Thunder Bay....it is nowhere near as scenic, and the traffic and road works actually ended up making our journey longer, not good since my parents' joints and muscles aint suited to long distance driving and my wife's morning sickness has just started to kick in! THANKS A LOT MAPQUEST......LOL.   WE STAYED IN CHICAGO LONGER THAN WE WANTED OR ANTICIPATED....LOL     We finally arrived back at our place at 3pm the Friday before last at 3pm and the folks and wife all went for a nap. I set about getting my boat straight back in the water...priorities right? When everybody had had their nap and some refreshments, and we had done a quick tour of the property and house, i suggested a boat ride...all thought this would be nice so off we went...LOLOL....my dad was too funny and just held onto his hat the whole time, anyone would think i had a 250hp strapped to the transom instead of my adequate 30hp Yamaha.......     HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS FOLKS!!!!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v1.flv"">    I was really keen to show them just how beautiful it is up here and thought the best way to do this was to go on the lakes where i fish, of course this would mean fishing too  . So that same afternoon i took them to Mile and Trap Lakes as it is very scenic, close to home and a good introduction to the species of fish available. I did not fish but my wife did the honours and pulled in some nice pike and bass as an intro. We ate the bass that night, and my folks were very impressed with the 'Living off the Land' aspect of our supper...city folks...so easily impressed....lol. The lake was not deserted as usual which was a shame and was quite 'crowded' by normal standards as all the PWT guys were out doing their pre-tournament fish, but Team Canada did beat the Americans in the end....GO CANADA!!     PWT GUYS GOING OUT PAST OUR HOUSE ON THE 1st DAY OF THE PRO-AM TOURNAMENT  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1694.flv"">     PWT RETURNING FOR WEIGH-IN ON FINAL DAY     The next day we had social engagements, that is to say we had a lot of people for them to meet in the 9 days they were here. But on the 3rd day i had planned to go and get some walleye (my dad's name is Wally...so their were plenty of jokes made that day) and we were joined by my wife's cousin Darton, and my wife’s other cousin's husband Matt...phew...extended family can be complicated but bare with me....lol.   We found the walleye no problem that day and for the 2 hours we spent out it was non stop, and we got our collective limit no problem. My dad said he had never fished before...which surprised me, but he was a natural....and he caught the first fish too....WAY TO GO DAD! he was also in the lead with the biggest fish until genetics played a dirty trick on him and let his son(me) get the biggest of the day.....i cant put into words how great it was to fish with my dad for the first time ever!!.........     DAD GOT THE FIRST ONE  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v2.flv"">      THE REST OF THE CREW        DADS A NATURAL......SO THATS WHERE I GET IT FROM....LOL       WE GOT OUR FISH SUPPER FOR THE NIGHT            The next day we did some sightseeing and food shopping and were back at the house by 4pm. Everybody was just resting, so i thought I’d go for a quick spin in the boat to relax.....to my surprise my mum asked to go fishing!!!!! ok...lol...twist my arm...lets go! We got into the boat and headed off to my mid water reef mark and the Lowrance again lit up with fishy arches everywhere. My mum also said she had never fished before, but she needed very little instruction. In fact i was very, very impressed.....its not easy to judge bottom and jig for walleye...it took me well over 2 months to get it anywhere near right and I’ve been fishing all my life, but my mum had it all but mastered on her first cast.....she also hooked into a fish on the first cast....this is what happened    THIS WAS SO COOL TO SEE  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v3.flv"">    My mum was definitely more into fishing than my dad, i was surprised at this as my dad is/was a professor of Zoology, but mum is a born natural....she was doing all the things a seasoned fisherman does on her first ever fishing trip....she was talking to the fish...saying ""here fishy, fishy, fishy""........cursing when a fish got off.......coaxing and willing the fish to bite out loud when it started to bite......and last but not least, when the sun started to set was insisting on “one last cast""....too funny     NATURAL BORN  FISHER(wo)MAN        AFTER AT LEAST 10 MORE 'LAST CASTS' WE WENT HOME       We had a couple more days rest from fishing after that and went to a lot of BBQs and did some more sightseeing on land. My dad had requested before he even arrived to go and catch some Lakers so on Friday we went to Thunder Lake with the downriggers.....the fish cooperated that day too...although we were our own worst enemies that day as i had set the release clips to hard and we ended up dragging 2 of the 3 fish we caught around the lake for half an hour a piece when we could have had them off and been catching more. Once again...my dad enjoyed it...but my mum was doing the whole 'one more cast' syndrome thing....i think she likes fishing!!! She was awesome cuz she took control of the boat perfectly as i reset the downriggers after catching. ALL the trout came on a gold and silver Williams spoon and a larger blue and silver Nasty Boy between 42 and 29 feet deep in 60-70 FOW.     MORE THAN JUST COMPETANT FISHING BUDDY, MUM TAKES THE HELM        MUM WITH HER FIRST         DAD GOT ONE TOO        I ALSO GOT AN UPGRADE OF 3"" FOR TEAM 4      On Saturday, the day before they left  , my buddy Chuck had arranged for us and our other friends Mel and his wife Sandra and son Pat to go to Tallman Lake to give my folks a taste of the whole shorelunch experience. Tallman Lake is a bit more remote than our usual haunts, and involves 45 km drive to  a 30kms drive on a logging road , then a 7km along a very narrow rocky and hilly trail, then a 4 km trip with motors up shallow along a 2' deep creek strewn with large boulders and fallen logs out to the main lake. I was a bit apprehensive about taking mum and dad into rough terrain like this, but they wanted to go, and what better way for them to get a real feel of where we live, work and play....so off we went......     AFTER THE LOGGING ROAD ITS 7kms ALONG THIS NARROW TRAIL  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v4.flv"">    FINALLY MADE IT TO THE PUT IN.....        I THINK CHUCK WAS SCARING MY DAD A BIT WITH THE GAFFE HOOK       ANOTHER 4kms UP THE SHALLOW CREEK  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v5.flv"">     WORTH THE TRIP JUST TO SEE MY FOLKS ENJOYING THE SIGHTS LIKE THIS BEAVER DAM        FINALLY REACHED THE MAIN LAKE        MY DAD WAS IN CHUCKS BOAT.....THEY TOOK SECONDS TO START FISHING ON REACHING THE MAIN LAKE      I did not get any action shots of our first fishing instalment of the afternoon as the action was fast and furious Once again mum struck first within minutes. My wife was also with us in the boat and she was doing a good job of keeping all the jackfish off our lines and was catching one after another of the slimy little guys. Because it took so long to get to the lake  it was not long after we had started fishing before chuck was calling us all in to start shorelunch, we were all using walleye spinners with live minnows, hammered gold were the best, with the fish all being taken mostly between 5 and 12 FOW along the shorelines facing the wind.  What followed was just the perfect shorelunch...weather perfect, excellent cooking, sandy beach, clear water, only a few bugs...and of course EXCELLENT COMPANY....I’ll let the pictures tell the story......     WAS NOT LONG BEFORE CHUCK CALLED US IN FOR SHORELUNCH        CHUCK AND ME WITH SOME OF THE FISH WE HAD IN THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF       I SET ABOUT CLEANING THE FISH             CHUCK TOOK CHARGE OF COOKING        THE UMBRELLAS CAME OUT       MY DAD, I KEPT TELLING HIM HE DID NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS WEAR THE LIFE JACKET, LOL, GUESS HE JUST LIKED IT       MY WIFE       CHUCK, SANDRA, MEL and PAT ENJOYING LUNCH       CHUCK DEMANDING MY DAD EATS MORE FISH(just kidding)        AFTER LUNCH AMBER WENT FOR A SWIM       MEL JOINED IN       THEN MEL'S SON AND CHUCK JOINED IN       THATS WHEN THE HORSE PLAY STARTED          After lunch we all went fishing again, after all we had made a dent in our limits so far....however the sun had taken its toll and my wife cleared the front deck and slept, whilst my mum caught one more and then decided she was content just watching the scenery whilst i replenished our stocks. Again i was using a hammered gold walleye spinner, and again the Lowrance located a pile of fish sitting just of a rocky shoreline in 8 feet of water. It took me just over an hour and a half to get our boat limit of 10 fish, and i must have thrown back at least 15 more small walleye and too many jackfish. I had marked the spot with the marker buoy and it was a fish a cast for the whole time.     SUN AND FOOD TOOK ITS TOLL ON MY WIFE, BUT SHE HELD UP WELL ALL DAY CONSIDERING HER MORNING SICKNESS HAS JUST STARTED      MUM GOT ONE MORE THEN SAT BACK AND TOOK IN THE SCENERY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v6.flv"">     TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GET 10 LIKE THIS       After around 2 hours we had caught enough fish and Chucks recoil rope had broken so it was time to head back. I was happy to get going too as it was around 6:30pm and we still had to get 3 boats out at a very cramped area in the middle of the bush. I am also pretty bad at reversing my trailer, especially in rough terrain, and today was gonna be no exception...lol, plus we still had to pack all the stuff away and do the group photos.    HAD A LITTLE RACE ON THE WAY BACK IN  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/v7.flv"">     OOOOPS....I'M STILL PRETTY BAD AT REVERSING       MUM, DAD, MY WIFE AND ME        THE WHOLE GANG        My mum and dad thoroughly enjoyed their stay with us, and i will treasure these memories for ever, cant believe I’ve fished nearly all 41 years of my life and never before now with either mum or dad! I HOPE THEY COME BACK SOON!!!!!!"
