Did most of our fishing at the mouth of the severn in the south end of the lake.Plenty of small pike caught on spinnerbaits and inline spinners. My buddy John switched over to a chugg bug and caught his new personal best largemouth out of 4 feet of water on a weed flat. Didnt get a weight but it was 21 inches long        Obligatory new world record poses      Have a nice day everyone"

Thanks for the post, very timely as i am heading off with the wife this morning for a day of bassin and pike with spinners and topwaters......i had great success with my chug bug last year....but only one bass on it this year...you have renewed my faith in what has been a hot go to lure for me in the past for both pike and bass.   TY for sharing."

241202,fishnsled,2008-08-19 13:00:00,3520,"Nice fish!!!    I caught a 21"" bucket a couple of years ago and it weighed in at 5 pounds 12 ounces to give you a ballpark weight.  Congrats to John on his PB!"

241226,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-19 13:46:00,0,Very nice bucket! We were going to go to Sparrow twice and both times we chose another lake! Sparrow has a lot of pressure but there are some good fish in there of all species.Thanks for sharing.
