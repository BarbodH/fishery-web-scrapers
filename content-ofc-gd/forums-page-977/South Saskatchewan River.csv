241494,HTHM,2008-08-20 04:40:00,4082,"I may have an opportunity to fish the South Saskatchewan River within the next 2 weeks. I would be about 1/2 hour north of Saskatoon. Anyone know anything about species, tackle, techniques?"
241496,holdfast,2008-08-20 05:21:00,1813,The North Saskatchewan runs through Saskatoon.  North is not the South.  In the North Saskatchewan you have a chance to catch Monster Walleye and Pike.  There is also Goldeye and Sturgeon as well as Ling.  They say that fishing the weir is your best bet in Saskatoon.
241537,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 12:52:00,8163,"If you have the time or oppertunity, try to make it to Cold Lake on the Alberta/Sask border. Excellent Laker and Pike territory!!!  I can give the name of an excellent charter service, I highly recommend them!"
241545,holdfast,2008-08-20 13:01:00,1813,"Even better is Meadow Provincial Park or Lake Diefenbaker.  If your near North Battleford-1hr 15 min West of Saskatoon, give me a call.  Just PM"
241556,HTHM,2008-08-20 13:16:00,4082,PM sent
241568,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 13:34:00,8163,"Here's a pic of a Cold Lake Lake Trout that I reeled in, most fish landed that day were close to this size... and there were a lot of them!!!    Just to give you and idea."
241575,Roy,2008-08-20 14:00:00,13728,Lake trout are considered a nuisance fish in Alberta. I'll bet that that one was even caught while trolling on a charter boat?
241578,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 14:08:00,8163," Yeah, pesky damn things!!! Always attacking the trolled frozen Anchovy and hooking themselves before the Yellow Perch could get to it!!!  I almost got sick of reeling those things in... almost."
241580,Roy,2008-08-20 14:10:00,13728,"I hear ya. No blues nor spots and you probably missed the shade of the wall too, eh?"
241644,HTHM,2008-08-20 17:29:00,4082,YEE HAA I goin'!  I hope that I will have time for fishing as I have a lot of work to do out there.
241673,douG,2008-08-20 19:01:00,2693,"Lake Dief has some nice bows.    Nice laker there, GCD."
241751,Greencoachdog,2008-08-20 23:24:00,8163," The Lakers and Pike made up for no Blues or Spots!  That was over the 4th of July weekend back in '04 I think. I welcomed the sun and warmer temps!!! Did you know the run their heaters up there at night in the summer time?... and for a dang good reason too!!! It was 49*F that morning and I had a sweatshirt, a vest, and a jacket on... the Hosers were running around in short sleeves and shorts!!! When it finally got up to the high of 79*F that day, I pulled my shirt off... just as the BIL was complaining of a Heat Stroke!!!  Nephew-in-law was thinking about taking a swim when he got ""accidentally"" bumped in to 50*F water by Ian... after gasping for breath for about 3 minutes he said the water felt GREAT!"
