This halved the allotted fishing time. So....left right from work and 1.5 hrs later we were getting up towards the lake. Its about 20km of dirt roads before the portages and we were hustling to get there...  Got into the lake after stepping over, around and between bear scat on the trail. fished for a few hours and landed 2 and lost a few more...10pm=Miller Time.  After a brutal truck sleep we were up at 6 to pursue a lake full of smallmouth.  After some initial disappointment on topwater the white spinner bait hit a chunky bass off a rock point. Few cast later another.   Then nothing...it turned out that the go to bait was a 3"" yum grub (chart.) on a 1/4 unpainted jighead. Location a timber choked shoreline dropping into 10-12 fow. Fish were then caught at breakneck speed. I ended up with 19 and the big fish being around 5lbs. Good morning for sure even had a pike come up and attack a smaller bass on the hook. After a few double headers and a celebratory beer we were en route to reenact FUBAR.   Great day on the water!"
