240755,Sugarpacket,2008-08-18 04:12:00,82,"There was a a great fishing couple with there fishing prodigy son who wanted to fish in a far off land but had no way to get there.  The great fisherman's old partner had refuse permission to let them come to his land to fish and would not carry them in his ""Ram"" cart to his ponds, so they had to find another way.  They found an old map with a secret trail leading from there land to his but it was a long journey (13 km) So they woke up at the crack of dawn (well lets not kid anyone 10 am) and set out on there long journey. They crossed the path of the most unholy evil omens, the dreaded black cat... and to top it off it was dead. Even tho they knew this was hexing their trips bounty they pressed on and met up with two dark wizards from a far off land that blessed them with the sacred words "" Ya mon Peace"" Taking this sign as a blessing they made there way across the border into the forbidden land.      They discovered that the fisherman's partner had be put under an evil love spell by the ice witch so instead of trying to help him they went to complete a much more important task... Fishing.  As they made their to the pond they ran into some slave smugglers who offered to take them to the forbidden land when they returned from helping the slaves escape, they exchanged  numbers and went their seperate ways not wanting to attract unwanted attention.  The trio finally made it to there destination to find out that the pond they were fishing was home to a rare fish that was hard to catch and would grant you one wish if you released it. They tried and they tried to catch this fish and it did not prevail they caught bluegill after bluegill after bluegill.    With a glitter of hope in his eye the fishermen pulled up the fool bass (rock bass) this was not the fish that would grant him his wish so he threw it back and set out once more.  The couples son had awaken and was reaady to try his hand but after a few cast his luck had not helped either.  Hope was dwindling before the light had and they tried every technique they could think of ( almost every one in the sugarpacket tactic handbook) Eventually the winds changed in their favor and the fisherman spotted a 6 pounder but within a blink it was gone.  They began to understand why the fish was so sought after and hoped that its magic was true, time was ticking.  The fisherman tossed his beloved spinner bait and missed a small 1 pounder, luck was not on their side that day.  They decieded they would fool the wish fish by pretending not toe fish for them but to fish for the blundering bluegill instead, they tossed a spinner and a super duper and jigged and jigged. After another 100 bluegill were caught the fisherman brought up the smallest wish fish he had ever seen! Surely if he made his wish this small fish could not grant it?! So he closed his eyes made his wish and tossed the fish back into the river.    Not long after the fisherwoman brought up another small wish fish (slightly bigger than the mans but who's keeping score?) and made her wish too. She tossed the lucky fish back in to the water from whenced it came.    As they made their way back to the trail they had taken their magic ball/phone sent them a message of a ride coming to take them to their land.  The fisherwoman turned to the fisherman and exclaimed her wish had been granted! On their journey a rock had injured her foot and made walking painful torture. Then the magic ball had revealed a second message their ride would be bring a picnic dinner for them to enjoy before going back to their land. The fisherman lit up with excitement, his wish had been answered too! FOOD! Now the couple was not selfish they knew that their small fish could not grant the wish of freeing their partner from the spell so why waste a good fish? The day went on and they did not catch another wish fish nor any other kind of fish for that matter so they returned home with full bellies.    THE END"
