With wife two daughters and two dogs i was busy anyway  . Most of the time we were ocupied with our ""youngsters"" ( 1 year old Rosie and 5 month old Sahsha. I wish I could learn swimming in 15 sec like they did    Well, the swimming lessons were tireing  Rosie  Sahsha   We've visited our friend (and his private lake )   Waiting for a dinner    Not much fishing, but quality time with family and dogs. Second week will be better"
