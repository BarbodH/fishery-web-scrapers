810852,Rod Caster,2013-10-04 01:11:00,5784,"There's a reason governments and military's use BB... now, once they start hiring teenage girls that may change  The biggest issue with BB is that it's is/was hugely integral in our Canadian Pension Plan. I can't imagine the losses we have ALL realized due to the collapse of its share price and eventual buy-out. You can bet the government spent a lot of money trying to prop it up too... Good thing Jim Balsilie didn't buy a hockey team several years ago!"
810860,irishfield,2013-10-04 02:30:00,26272,"Oh Jim's not down to eating peanut butter sandwiches just yet... unless he wants to do so!! I'm waiting for the share price to become ""Motorola toilet paper"" and then I'm gonna buy a bunch!"
810881,Lape0019,2013-10-04 11:50:00,647,Do you have any idea at what type of plans the bug 3 have for BB's for the government? Let's just say that I pay about 3 times the amount for my iPhone than they do for a single blackberry. The other issue is that it takes for ever to approve any other phones in the government networks and I don't believe the want to spend the time or money to approve an iPhone or android device. The only reason BB is still around is because of the government and other smaller businesses using it.
810886,jedimaster,2013-10-04 12:02:00,3472,"BlackBerry Bold and q10 is still by far the best productivity tool. I support about 500 handhelds in my company. Currently using a z10, was on an S3 as well iPhone. the few people here that went to iPhone all switched back after a few months and Android after no more than one month. IPhone has the most apps, lots of games, navionics etc.. intuitive for kids, very closed design.. EG you can't even use it as a thumb drive if you need to transfer files to it quickly. The calendar is barely tolerable and typing is very poor.  Galaxy/android more powerful than the iPhone not as intuitive and still buggy even on the latest release if software. It is also prone to virus and lots of malware. Will need to be rebooted daily.  BlackBerry, even the new os is very intuitive I find the touch typing screen far easier to type in the z than the galaxy or iPhone I had. The q gives you the comfortable feedback that many like.  Not to mention blackberry is still a Canadian success story and most of the naysayers here have posted in the ""Canadian made"" thread wishing for more Canadian born business success. No doubt that we will be switching to something within the next few years and most likely it will be the iPhone because the presidents kids have iphones. Some will like it and most will just stop using it for email as they can't type on it. Even most iPhone users tout how much they love and will freely admit that they rarely type emails longer than ""yep""  Btw the z and q both support full flash in there browsers making the Web experience much better.  Having said all that would I put my personal money into a blackberry. I don't think so. Not until it's been decided where the sale is going. I would wait or if needed one right now go on a month to month with a Kijiji phone or look elsewhere."
810887,Rod Caster,2013-10-04 12:04:00,5784,"nothing to do with gov approvals. Its the BB network. the other phones has unsecured networks that can't handle the military/governmetn needs. The canadian gov just (or will soon) approved I-Phones/samsungs for their employees, but they all use the BB network. Basically it would be walk and talk like an I-Phone but use the BB software so google or any other amateur hacker doesn't access and sell all their data to the highest bidder.  I know this because I have a family member who basically decides what the Feds use for computers/phones."

Samsung phones are getting top ratings on android platform and pretty hard to not like all the stuff I can do on an iphone.

810781,Lape0019,2013-10-03 20:13:00,647,"I love my iPhone 4 and will be upgrading to a new one when my plan is up for renewal. I have not used a BB but from what everyone has told me, the only item it excels at is their mail system. Mine only pushes to the phone every 5 minutes  ( this is the fastest setting but I just check whenever I feel like it) where the BB will do it instantaneous. Other than that, I understand why they are having troubles competing.  For your carrier, I used to be with Rogers but switched when my term was up. I was on a three year term and had a phone under my familly plan for my mother. When she passed away, they would not let me out of the contract unless I forked over something like $400.00 so I just kept the phone I until my term was up. When I called to cancel and switch to Telus, they told me they would have waived the cancellation fee for my moms phone. Honestly I felt the right hand didnt know what the left hand was doing. My other issue is that my cottage is near Cornwall and with Rogers, I would get charged roaming when I was still in Canada because the closest tower was in the us. With Telus, this is still a bit of an issue but he phone allows you turn on and off roaming so u haven't had any issues. Coverage in my area is also better with Telus. I still think Vell has the best canada wise coverage but Telus has never given me issues."

810793,tb4me,2013-10-03 20:59:00,3295,I havent read any of the other replies..Here's my input.. I own 2 new Blackberry z10's They both work great! They run just as good as my sons I phone running IOS7. If your considering an older BB platform then you wont have to worry about service from BB as they are bullet prof and very affordable..Heck if you want I have a excellent shape BB curve you can have for free if your into paying for shipping. Its locked to the rogers network..Its white and like new. Let me know if your interested..
810797,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-03 21:05:00,10439,"For me, I can't stand touch screen keyboards. My fingers are too big and I never know what letter is being hit until it's too late and I have to backspace and retype. I have a BB Torch 9810 which is a touch screen with a real keyboard. I have a much easier time with that. I also deploy and maintain a BB server here at work so we have a bunch of devices out there.  I really love it for email and texting. Not really one for doing a lot of internet surfing or game playing on my phone but I do use it for weather, directions etc.  I've tried to use iphones and have a terrible time with the keyboard.  My pay as you go Alaska phone is just a cheap LG but it also has a slide out real keyboard."
810799,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-03 21:10:00,4399,Ditto...used a BB for years for business nothing better imho. I phones and the like are great for texting/apps etc. And of course for teenage girls taking selfies and posting for all world to see.  If your using it for business I would say make the change if not stay with android.  Check out koodo.
810801,fishindevil,2013-10-03 21:19:00,6254,Well over the years I have had 2 BB and 2 iPhones with this one being an iphone5 and for the bang for the buck my BB's were awesome but for speed and apps and surfing the web the iPhone is better IMO !!!! But if you are just going to be texting and don't want games and all the fancy stuff go BB for sure !!! And you can save money
810805,Rod Caster,2013-10-03 21:28:00,5784,"I slam out dozens of emails each day from my phone and sometimes I gotta do it quick and very wordy...the BB bold (touchscreen with keypad) was GOLD for typing with confidence. Unfortunately work sent me a new Z10 without a touchscreen pad. The operating system is nice and the antenna is WAYYYY better (i get reception at my house now!), but I don't like the touchscreen typing and I can't understand why anyone would want this or any other touchscreen for work...all they care about is being cool and having games and stupid apps?? I get horribly typed out emails all the time and I know why!  Now when I need to send important emails from the field, I'd rather log in to my computer...really wish they sent me a Q10.  Funny, that my company is partially owned by Fairfax, so technically, BB may soon be part of my family of companies! kind of cool, but whatever. . If you email/type a lot in the field, the keypad is KEY. No substitute.  Blackberry is going nowhere, they will have support for your device for many years, I wouldn't worry about that."

810847,porkpie,2013-10-04 00:15:00,2521,"I use an iPhone 5, I am not a teenage girl, nor do I have any game apps on it.  What I do have is a bunch of useful functions for work, navionics and a GPS, a pretty good pocket camera, a photo editor that can turn even marginal pictures into half decent ones, google maps a calender and a few other useful apps.  I can also put some music on it for the ride to work, and get a couple different email accounts in one place.  The blackberry can do some of this.  The blackberry itself is not bad, but the usual BB apologists trot out the teenage girl stuff, which is tired and overdone.  There is a reason that BB is steadily losing market share, and android and apple are gobbling it up, and it ain't teenage girls!!  All that aside, whatever poison you choose, be it BB, apple or android the only advice I would give is to try and get away from Rogers.  Wind is great if your service area supports the wind home network, if not have a good look at virgin.  Yes bell owns them, but their plans are less expensive, they have Canada wide calling and decent packages, and of course it's on bell network so you have service nearly anywhere!  As for upgrades etc, I wouldn't bother, just go buy a refurb and don't get stuck with a particular provider.  I simply buy whatever device I want now, and I'm free to take my business elsewhere at the drop of a hat.  Good luck!"
