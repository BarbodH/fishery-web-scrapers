If not there is a few launches around but that is the one is suggested seeming you mentioned Emily pp."
811454,jimmer,2013-10-07 14:51:00,2730,I personally would launch at Nogies Creek in the north end and fish up there rather than the river or south end. The water is very clear in the lower end which can make for some tough fishing. At least you have some depth up the north end.
811456,lew,2013-10-07 14:59:00,12766,When fishing Pigeon I often use Gannons Narrows Marina to launch the boat.  It's just east of the actual lake on the south shore of Gannons Narrows.  It's getting a bit rough but still usable and they've also got gas & washrooms if needed.
