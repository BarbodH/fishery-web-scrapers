810869,nexstar,2013-10-04 04:25:00,63,I was out fishing for largemouth bass in the Kawarthas last weekend and brought my new Gopro camera with me. Manage to catch some action on video. The fish are still in the shallow stuff and they are very active. The bigger fish were caught in the evening when my Gopro went out of batteries but still got some good footage.  Enjoy!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6KPKjtu8j8
