811162,BillM,2013-10-06 13:26:00,17367,Get a hold of Mr.Dunn..  That would be a worthwhile investment..
811172,Parisite,2013-10-06 13:59:00,66,"Thanks Bill. Thought about that but I don't have a ton of free time as it is a work trip.  Also, I hope he sees this post because the link to his website in the OFC business section is broken.  It took me to a website written in Japanese (I think)."
811276,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-06 22:01:00,0,Be careful!  In the main rapids they have a bunch of gates open so beyond the concrete berm is pretty well unwadable.
811304,TDunn,2013-10-06 22:37:00,680,"Thanks for the shout out Bill! Doc is right also. 4 gates are open in the rapids and will be for at least another few weeks. I waded in a few weeks ago to check it out and it was something to see let alone stand beside. Although there is some water you can fish, it is extremely dangerous down there. On a good note the rivers north are an option. I've been fishing and guiding up there for a few weeks now. Coho and bows.  Here's a link to my temp website http://tylerdunnguiding.wix.com/tyler-dunn-outdoors  Hit me with a PM or email if you would like"

811487,Lake Ranger,2013-10-07 18:55:00,70,"Hi, just letting you know I cross the bridge every day and see a ton of guys fishing down there! A dozen or so at any given time! Good luck!"
811554,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-07 23:57:00,0,"Getting a guide in the rapids would DEFINITELY be ideal if you only have a few hours.  they'll put you into fishy water faster, and help you navigate through the rubes. tyler would be an excellent choice.  there's also a local fly shop on gore street that offers guiding (http://soonorthflyshop.shawwebspace.ca/ ) and local guide John Giuliani. not sure of John's contact info, and he's  probably pretty busy this time of year."
