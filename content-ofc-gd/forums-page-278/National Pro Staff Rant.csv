811233,Terry,2013-10-06 17:52:00,14456,"don't disagree with you  but we are talking about ethics  and  ethics in fishing is really just ones own opinion over anothers , anything beyond what the law states is just opinion   I know  people who when fishing keep everything legal and when they have their limit they quit fishing, they keep telling me hurting fish for sport is cruel and they only fish for food. that is their ethics, their opinion well it is the same for people who need to give every detail and photos and waypoints..they think they are doing a good thing. I do not believe that any thing posted here is going to change their minds...and they are not breaking any law, so they see  no reason to listen to peoples rightest rants"
811235,Salmonidstalker,2013-10-06 18:07:00,265,"They may think they are doing a good thing, but the reality is that they are doing it for swag.  And just because its legal, does not mean its good practice or morally and ethically right.  I could go down the river each day and kill two rainbows, eat them, and get two more the next day....and so on and so on. It's perfectly legal, but the reality is eventually the river suffers.  It's posts like these that make it easier for anglers to get their limit or even worse, poachers to take him far more.  I actually do think it will change their minds if they do read this.  They may think twice about posting the day or day after they fish it.  these guys must love fishing the rivers, and they are young and they will grow out of their ways.  And you're right, it's just my opinion. But guys who care about migratories, and river systems in general understand what I'm saying."
811236,Terry,2013-10-06 18:13:00,14456,"I don't disagree, but I have had discussions with people like that and I know it falls on deaf ears  this type of thread is just to vent and to gather with people with the same opinion, in my opinion"
811281,RJackson,2013-10-06 22:13:00,113,Here's a different opinion. Close the rivers to this onslaught.  Solved.  RJ
811286,Salmonidstalker,2013-10-06 22:23:00,265,"Interesting opinion but I I'll assume you don't target migratories predominantly.  For a die hard migratory angler and conservation minded individual,  they understand how sensitive the dynamic of a river fishery is and what it needs to sustain itself.  It wouldn't be cool if someone posted pictures or burned whatever fishery you are in to, or even worse, close it down.   I love all fish but I have a passion for migratories, in the lake and in the river.  Closing the fishery is definitely not the answer. Even a little common sense, like not posting backgrounds goes a long way."
811287,porkpie,2013-10-06 22:23:00,2521,"I think that is an excellent idea.  Further, we should also ban any recreational or stakes based tournaments, and perhaps guide services as well.  I believe they take a serious toll on our fisheries, I am sure you will agree!"
811294,RJackson,2013-10-06 22:27:00,113,I knew I'd get a reaction!  I'm kidding fellas.  I do a little bit of steel heading myself.  I enjoy the peace and quiet of the river as much as you do.

811301,SirCranksalot,2013-10-06 22:34:00,3291,"Fair point. But if the pic is more than a few days old, which it often is, then it's a bit late to rush out in hopes of 'hitting a run""."

Trying to get any of the tackle companies to spend a dime on advertising is pretty much impossible,   I've met a thousand  (well dozens) people who have said.. i could do a fishing show or be a tourney pro, without realizing that the whole process is likely more about business than it is about fishing.  Just ask anyone trying to hold on to sponsors .... seems to me like having pro staff post pictures everywhere is great ""pretty much"" free advertising.

Its about up to date reporting of spots, giving anglers more info than they should ever have handed to them.  And all for internet fame and a crappy rod or tackle that most anglers would pass on it even if it was given to them.  Are you one of those spot burners? Your location says Oshawa and thats fairly close to all of the tribs being shown in the pictures.

It’s their decision to do so. But it’s naïve to think that everyone who reads the report on OFC follows the regulations (and many of the gut & chuckers don’t even use fishing rods – let alone bait - on the smaller creeks).  For me, if I want to post a report, I could always do it from a massive body of water where pin-pointing the exact location is impossible, I could wait a week or few, I could wait till the river is blown and unfishable, I could wait till the season closes, I could post pics from a large stretch of private property that I have exclusive permission to fish, I could wait till the river freezes over, etc."

810760,MJL,2013-10-03 17:53:00,2427,"Eastern ditches..... What a crappy little term. I have never understood why steelheaders speak of these creeks with such derision, yet they will all flock to them as soon as a run is in. It's like sucking all the enjoyment out of something that you can, and then running it into the ground!   I can look at a few pics posted on NPS and say, ""when I was his age, I was drifting right where he is standing now."" Plus where else in Ontario can you drift for chrome steelhead, catch a new PB condom, snag a bottle of vodka floating down river and look next to you and think, is this Deliverance part 2? (seriously though, you meet some strange people on the rivers there). 15yrs ago, there was 2.5 times more water flowing through those creeks before development took hold.  For me, I'd rather spend my time and gas money fishing where I'd want to be the most, even if it means fishing far less often. I have missed out on amazing spring runs in my local creek because I didn't want to deal with the crowds. I do far less fishing now in spring because the rivers I enjoy fishing the most are blown. If I'm miserable while I'm fishing, what's the point of going there in the first place?  I grew up fishing the eastern ditches. I still go for walks along the rivers with my camera. Perhaps when my nephew who's 18 months gets older I might break out the rod again and fish.  I too fished South Hampton  over 40 years ago ,The gentleman described it to a T. I never went back. This same stuff is starting to pop up in the carp angling scene here. If you can believe it. The most under exploited fish we have in Ontario . found virtually every where in Southern Ontario and guys are getting into it for the same reasons that are talked about in this post. Monster egos, greed, selfishness, jealousy and even violence are starting to creep into the sport. We also have the added incentive of the sport being relatively new to a lot of anglers. So we get the guys who think they are writing them selves into the history books. Even though the book has been written and they are not in it. These guys are relatively few in numbers but they can cause a lot of problems because carp angling here is a very social recreation. Half a dozen guys fishing together is fairly common here. Pro Staff are mainly used by bait manufacturers in carp angling. You can actually get one man band operations that make carp baits and use pro-staff. The term ""swim jumping"" is being bandied about. We call a spot that we fish for carp a swim. So the words are a take off from the old gold rush days "" claim jumpers"" . Different pot but same old stuff in it.    It’s the same yearly cycle Lorne "
810779,kemper,2013-10-03 20:02:00,2232,"It's the show-off factor - nothing else.  I haven't read the whole thread, but I can guess that all the bases were covered.  I understand to a point, in that I used to like showing off shiny silver steelhead as much as the next guy. That said, I always tried to hide locations out of simple logic - if I tell everyone where I was, I won't be alone tomorrow.  Some of the gbay tribs have seen an absolute explosion of traffic over the past 3 years, and it is directly attributable to sites like NPS and Facebook heros.  Public shaming has worked well with the kids (yikes, did I say kids? It seems like only a few days ago I was a 16 year old steelhead hero...) around here.  It's unfortunate that some tackle companies (one in particular) feel the need to string along a whole whack of young anglers with promises of free gear and ""prostaff"" titles if they blast hero reports every which way."

Anyone who has ever owned a cottage will know what I mean. It's a summer Saturday morning, you're sitting on your dock with a coffee, and you watch a parade of idiots in bass boats pulling up to your dock one after the other, some of them even give you the death stare because you're out there interrupting their fishing.  I mean, dude, it's my dock. Buzz off.  There are countless stories of tournament guys (some of them probably PRO STAFF ... LOL) who blatantly cast around swimmers. The complete lack of courtesy and sense of entitlement isn't restricted to people in waders.  Sorry to say.    this I do not understand  the cottager has no more rights to the water then the boater  if I tried to stop people from parking their cars in front of my house or if I tried to kick skateboarders off the sidewalk near my house people  would think I was crazy  well it is no different with cottagers, how dare they think they have rights to the land or water around them that they do not own"

I don't care if someone wants to fish the dock. I fish docks too. But I do find it unacceptable when some guy comes roaring up to the dock, cuts the 225 hp about two boat lengths away, then proceeds to give me a dirty look for simply being there at all - as if my mere presence had somehow ruined his day.  It isn't about who has rights to this or that or whatever. It's about common courtesy and consideration for others. Too many fishermen have neither. And often, the worst ones are plastered from head to toe with various tackle company logos.  As I said, I like to fish docks too. But I won't fish one if the people are around. There are many other docks to fish, so I back off and respect their privacy.  Am I wrong to expect the same in return?"

Hi Lew, I totally agree with you on this and I have certainly seen my share of disgruntled fisherman fighting over their lines in the river and their spots etc. The last time I did anything like that was 44 years ago at the Saugeen River in Southhampton and I watched guys then fighting and shoving each other around.

Thanks, but I'll gladly stick with the solitude of my boat.  Lew, it applies to every species of fish. I’m sure if you (or anyone) was looking to get some walleye for dinner, you wouldn’t motor your boat to the local shoal where 40 boats are drifting/trolling around that 1 spot. The reason the eastern ditches are so popular is because they’re in close proximity to the largest city in Toronto. The paths along the rivers have been worn for over 60yrs by anglers before us and now, many of those paths are paved for easy travel. As far as reading water goes, at this point in time when there is no water, it’s easy to spot fish in water knee deep.  I still enjoy my steelhead fishing because I’m not fishing with the crowds (usually I’m just alone or with a close friend). I looked at a map, sometimes knocked on a few land-owner’s doors, pushed my way through a bit of forest and found no one at the other side. I can fish a stretch of river and never see anyone else the whole day.  There’s a lot more to steelhead fishing than those eastern lake O ditches. On that note, I value those streams even though I don’t fish them much anymore (I mostly just hike along with my cameras)…They have wild populations of trout & salmon. My license and tax $ weren’t spent to stock any of them with steelhead. My $ goes a longer way when they are not getting raped and exploited by other people (and so does yours)."

810740,craigdritchie,2013-10-03 15:47:00,1586,"Wow, go fishing for a day and look at all I miss ....    It’s not 'where' that’s the issue, it’s 'when'.  Mike, I couldn't agree more. My big beef with internet boards has always been their power to expose entire runs of fish to instant and concentrated pressure. I always hate it when someone posts a picture or a description that identifies specific spots (especially those ""I went 18 for 26"" posts) because you know the next day there will be 50 new vehicles parked at that very spot. If 100 guys read their post then each tell two or three friends ... and they tell two or three friends ... well, you know how it ends.  I have no beef with magazines or TV shows ... yes, we all know the spots. But to Mike's point, we don't all descend on the place when the fish are heavily concentrated at that precise moment, and at their most vulnerable. By giving away the 'when' the internet has the power to seriously damage those fish populations, in a way that magazines or TV shows never could.   Getting sucked in s'what happens when you wannabe a wannabe. There are very few bona fide professionals in that gang but hey, that's just my opinion.   There have always been attention hogs who would do just about anything for a couple of free jigs ... or just to feed their own egos. They seem to need attention at any cost. Maybe their moms didn't pick them up enough when they were infants.    It's not about exact spots though, it never is..   It's about providing thousands of your new best friends with up to date river conditions.   Yup, what he said. Trout and salmon populations are fairly fragile things. It looks like a lot of fish when they're crammed into a little stream, but when you start harvesting those fish, it cuts the number of breeders very quickly.  It isn't just about angler harvest either. Three years ago a run of salmon came up the Credit really, really early. There were about a dozen of us who knew they were in, and we had a blast fishing for them. Then some idiot put a post and photo on a message board (not this one). The next day, there were no fish left in the pool I had been fishing, but probably 30 slit carcasses all along the bank. Goes to show, you cannot control who sees your post. It isn't always the people you necessarily want to share it with. So thanks, idiot. Hope feeding your ego was worth it.   I've never fished a river and I have absolutely no plans to ever do so, and reading posts like this one only re-affirms my feelings.  I have NO idea how any of you guys can find enjoyment in this type of fishing when your shoulder to shoulder with guys, ducking under each others lines to land a fish, and actually getting into fights with each other.  Thanks, but I'll gladly stick with the solitude of my boat.   It's not just in rivers though Lew, it's a behavour problem that goes farher than that. Anyone who has ever owned a cottage will know what I mean. It's a summer Saturday morning, you're sitting on your dock with a coffee, and you watch a parade of idiots in bass boats pulling up to your dock one after the other, some of them even give you the death stare because you're out there interrupting their fishing.  I mean, dude, it's my dock. Buzz off.  There are countless stories of tournament guys (some of them probably PRO STAFF ... LOL) who blatantly cast around swimmers. The complete lack of courtesy and sense of entitlement isn't restricted to people in waders.  Sorry to say.    Word is right, theres plenty of this to go round when the snow starts flyin. Not a footprint to be found .....My favorite time of year    I love that photo. And that particular spot. I have a similar picture, in fact, taken more than 30 years ago. Except mine isn't as pretty as your picture.   I don't really understand the whole pro staff thing. I totally get someone wanting to make a living in the fishing business. I did, and I put food on the table for more than 25 years by writing about fishing as a full-time job. I totally understand that to do that, you have to pay your dues when you start out, and do a lot of work that isn't exactly lucrative.  Everyone in the industry has, at one time or another, worked their tail off for not very much reward - me, Bob and Wayne Izumi, Big Jim, Mark Kulik, Mark Krupa, Al Lindner, Dave Mercer, John Kerr, Bill Dance, Ang Viola, Pete Bowman ... I can name names all afternoon. But while we may have all worked hard for humble rewards, we never gave it away for free.  There's a huge difference between paying your dues, and paying out-of-pocket to be a product shill. These pro staff guys just don't get it - they don't understand that by paying to work for nothing, that's all they'll ever make. There is no career at the end of that road.  The only other reason to do it, then, is ego - pure and simple."

This same stuff is starting to pop up in the carp angling scene here. If you can believe it. The most under exploited fish we have in Ontario . found virtually every where in Southern Ontario and guys are getting into it for the same reasons that are talked about in this post. Monster egos, greed, selfishness, jealousy and even violence are starting to creep into the sport. We also have the added incentive of the sport being relatively new to a lot of anglers. So we get the guys who think they are writing them selves into the history books. Even though the book has been written and they are not in it. These guys are relatively few in numbers but they can cause a lot of problems because carp angling here is a very social recreation. Half a dozen guys fishing together is fairly common here. Pro Staff are mainly used by bait manufacturers in carp angling. You can actually get one man band operations that make carp baits and use pro-staff. The term ""swim jumping"" is being bandied about. We call a spot that we fish for carp a swim. So the words are a take off from the old gold rush days "" claim jumpers"" . Different pot but same old stuff in it.  "

Or instead of putting $50 into NPS, why not donate to an organization like CRAA, Nottawasaga Steelheaders, MEA or the like or even joining a fishing club (like the Scarborough casting club or a bass fishing club) and make personal connections that way?  All the people I know who tried to pro-staff various products ended up spamming online message boards. At the end of it all, no one really cared for the products or the person.

Blame   Technology    I guess I'm one of the few people that doesn't use a cell phone  I think if there’s anything Ironic about it all, while attempting to take underwater shots of salmon (unsuccessfully…The river was a little too stained), I overheard one of the pro-staffer wannabes complaining about the crowds while taking hero shots of his friend (for over 4 minutes with the fish out of the water, possibly killing it in the process) and posting the pics to a facebook group…If only there was an emoticon to describe the level of my bewilderment."
