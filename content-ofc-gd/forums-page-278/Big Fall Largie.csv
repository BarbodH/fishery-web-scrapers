811445,Roy,2013-10-07 14:21:00,13728,A really nice one Rich. Topwater?
811446,Rich,2013-10-07 14:22:00,3927,"Thanks sir, nope it was the dead slow spinnerbait death roll that was annihilating them. Couldn't rise a fish on topwater. Though I can't figure out why as they were indeed surfacing like crazy that evening."
811447,BillM,2013-10-07 14:27:00,17367,"Thanks sir, nope it was the dead slow spinnerbait death roll that was annihilating them. Couldn't rise a fish on topwater. Though I can't figure out why as they were indeed surfacing like crazy that evening.  Probably chasing shad.  Next time break out some spoons and try vertical jigging, it can be absolutely insane when you stumble onto a big school    Nice fish man!"
