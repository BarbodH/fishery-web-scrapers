811479,Slayingm,2013-10-07 18:06:00,204,The emerald shiners are really starting to stack up at the river mouths of Simcoe and the big perch are right behind them.  There are literally 1000's of perch schooled up in the 22 to 35ft range and Jigging Raps and small spoons along with drop shotting Pan Slammers have been the ticket to good catches!Get out there and enjoy the family fun.Be safe and good Fishing!
