811948,pidge,2013-10-10 01:01:00,438,Wow wild story. I highly doubt they wanted to start a war with anyone. Seems like there willing to write there wrong and go to the ceremony. Throw a human in the mix and there's always room for error. Everyone makes mistakes how else you gonna learn.
811955,Cookslav,2013-10-10 01:24:00,1457,"They didn't know it was somthing sacred to the native tribe and they've put their best foot forward trying to appologize by giving the pelt to the tribe....thats pretty solid effort if you ask me. They really didn't do anything wrong, immoral or illegal and they certainly didn't ""need"" to do anything but they took the high road regardless so I think its all good..."

811796,turtle,2013-10-09 10:46:00,274,In certain WMU's in Ontario hunting white/albino moose is prohibited.
811798,outllaw,2013-10-09 10:59:00,1232,"no laws broken. they had tags. whats the deal. do we not eat white cows,goats,sheep."
811801,turtle,2013-10-09 11:39:00,274,"The debate is law vs. ethics and ethics is personal. If the white moose is legal, its a question of ethics killing a more rare variant.  In Ontario you can shoot a turkey on the roost as long as it's legal light.  I won't, mainly because I don't want to hit the turkey's rear end and don't want to miss the best part of the hunt bringing the turkey in.  If I have a doe tag I'll shoot a 100lb button buck but not a 65lb skinny fawn.  I mostly fish for species that I'll eat and keep what I need, stop fishing and eat what I keep, not catch and release. The law says I can catch as many as I want as long as I don't exceed my catch limit."

811811,aplumma,2013-10-09 12:08:00,6896,The albino gene is a recessed gene that is actually a mutation. If it produced lets say a crippling effect on the animal we would shoot it out of compassion. It however does produce a beautiful oddity that I personally like so I have let all albino deer walk on when I hunt. Art

Anyhow..."

But that's just me  The leader of the native group called and spoke to the hunters.  Upon explaining the importance the hunters now understand and gave the hides for spirtal ceramony.  All is good.  I think the issue was not the complaining but complaining to the wrong people.. They went to the media first if they just contacted the hunters first this would be a non story."

They're ""jerks"" and ""jackarses"" because they took advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity while following the law? Albino animals are rare and beautiful specimens, but how is this any different than shooting a record non typical moose (which would bring nothing but praise and $$$) which is also just as rare or possibly even rarer?  The point is I just don't see why shooting one rarity is okay, but the other is frowned upon."
811859,Bernie,2013-10-09 16:57:00,3190,An albino moose is actually a defect. Has a missing gene.Still a moose.No laws against shooting one that I know of. Fills the freezer.

Once you start treading on their beliefs and not acknowledging their culture then you have effectively indicated that you fail to recognize them as a distinct culture or race period.  That is when the trouble will start!  What ever happened to words like respect and  sensitivity?  JMO"
