811250,John Bacon,2013-10-06 19:15:00,3277,"Actually looked at a Magellan at my local CT store this morning. It was $80 off. Was hoping for some feedback on those units. Seems Garmin and TomTom are more popular. Garmin being the leader in this mini poll. If the weather tomorrow is as nasty as they say, I'll do the circuit. Future Shop, Best Buy, Costco and CTC.  Thanks again to all.  I have used both Tom Tom and Magellan.  They both work but I found the Tom Tom to be a little more user friendly.  Or, perhaps that is just what I am used to because I owned the Tom Tom first."
811253,davey buoy,2013-10-06 19:54:00,5505,"So these automobile units ,can you use portable?,or do they need to be plugged into a 12volt supply?(cigarett lighter)all the time?. Do any or all have a charging battery built in?.Sorry for the side track."
811254,Bill Shearer,2013-10-06 20:01:00,456,"Most run on battery power for a while. They are also small enough to tuck in a pocket. About the size of a large pack of smokes. (it's been 40 years but I still remember them).lol IMO the cost is well worth it. I have had them for many years, and actually paid $1200 for my first Garmin when they came out! Now they are $100, and so much more user friendly!"

So if you were going on a hike by foot for example,you would most likely need a portable battery pack?,or buy a Iphone or similar where the battery time would last a lot longer I would think. Woud like to have one for the truck,boat,ice fishing etc transferable.Thanks."
811291,Bill Shearer,2013-10-06 22:25:00,456,"There are several hours of operating time on my Garmin, before you need to plug in. I have used it for at least 4 hours before it needed a power source. Certainly depends on the unit, number of times recharged, etc. But I would check out the latest/greatest. They change for the better all the time. Another consideration is that the GPS will work whether or not cell phone reception is available."

Do any or all have a charging battery built in?.Sorry for the side track.  They have an internal battery that will power them for a while.  However, they are designed for navigating official road ways.  I am not sure how you intend to use it; they don't have lake maps nor waypoints that make marine units usefull to fisherman.  It may help you find the nearest road if you were lost in the bush."

810905,Roe Bag,2013-10-04 14:10:00,246,Looking for advice on a GPS for my wife's car. Doesn't need to be the best of the best. Just accurate and user friendly. Thanks in advance.
810909,John Bacon,2013-10-04 14:21:00,3277,"I found the TomTom to be a little more user friendly than my Magellan.  However, the TomTom did stop working a little after one year... that may have been caused by an issue with my trucks electrical system.  I found that they are both pretty accurate for North America.  I was sent the wrong way on a one way street once.  Most seem to have life time updates now."
810911,BillM,2013-10-04 14:41:00,17367,Garmin for the maps alone.
810912,coolwater,2013-10-04 14:54:00,43,"Got two Garmin Nuvi's, have had them for a couple of years, work great, excellent nav features, eg: favourites, auto home, places of interest, etc. Purchased lifetime updates for both, can update maps several times per year."
810928,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 16:30:00,10439,Garmin Nuvi user here too.
810946,aplumma,2013-10-04 18:22:00,6896,I am a contractor and use the tom tom it has lifetime maps and the updates are frequent and accurate. (US maps).   Art
810949,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-04 18:49:00,4399,I use a nuvi  as well with no complaints but the samsung smart phone works very well too.
810952,Rich Clemens,2013-10-04 18:55:00,3131,"Farmin Nuvi is what I have been using for years and has yet to steer me wrong. I have the 5"" model wiht Lifetime Maps and Traffic Updates."
810955,craigdritchie,2013-10-04 18:59:00,1586,"Garmin Nuvi for me too. Lifetime map updates, great screen, easy to use. I'm very happy with it."
810980,MJL,2013-10-04 22:36:00,2427,"I’ve been a Garmin Nuvi user even before I started to drive. I’ve been extremely happy with it. With that said, there was one time I was instructed to do a U-turn on the 401 while going eastbound after entering the city of Oshawa (jokes aside, I’m being serious).  I’m also not a fan of the newest narrator on my dad’s latest Nuvi unit. She sounds way too demanding and doesn’t seem like she finds satisfaction in her line of work.LOL"
810984,Canuck,2013-10-04 23:00:00,491,"Costco has Garmins at a good price. i got one with a traffic feature that uses FM traffic signals to choose least traffic routes. Seems to work OK in Toronto.  i have used both tomtom and garmin  They are both good.  I like tomtom interface better, but they are both easy to use.  Get one with lifetime map updates."
810999,Roe Bag,2013-10-05 01:09:00,246,My wife has had a TOM TOM for several years but it bit the dust. Seems to be internal. Won't power up. With her sense of direction she can get lost in a parking lot. I guess it's time to go shopping. Thanks for the replies. Much appreciated.

I have had Garmin for years now and find it very helpful but not always 100% accurate. The ""fastest time"" isn't always the fastest time but it is really good at getting me where I want to go."
811034,nofish4me,2013-10-05 12:34:00,404,"Just did a trip and here's my results for GPS's. I always take my Garmin and another fellow always takes his TomTom. My garmin showed us on the road the whole time, the Tom Tom usually showed us as off the road, but in the general area. On this trip we had no Cell service for days and days, so the smart phone thingy is not for me. Now where we were was pretty hard to get actually lost, as there was really only one Hwy, if you could call it that. Never been on a Hwy that was all gravel and mud before. Hahaha."
811038,Roe Bag,2013-10-05 13:38:00,246," My garmin showed us on the road the whole time, the Tom Tom usually showed us as off the road, My wife's TomTom did that often as well. Seems the Garmin just went to the head of the class. Nothing but wind and rain here today. Good day to go shopping.. Thanks again guys."
811042,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-05 15:20:00,10439,My Garmin even has the ice road to the diamond mines on it.
811058,mistaredone,2013-10-05 20:17:00,913,Put the money toward an iPhone. Beats any GPS on the market
811061,Bill Shearer,2013-10-05 21:05:00,456,"I have an iPhone, and absolutely love it.The Maps feature is ok when pre-planning a trip. But I have to say that it does not replace a good GPS in any way. First off you can't be watching it all the time while driving. 2nd it does not announce turns etc. 3rd it does not give re-routes when you screw up, and lastly my GPS displays the speed limits where I am. I have a heavy foot, and have saved money when it warns me. (Fines) That happens often when I'm heading to the GTA. Plus, I have taken it when traveling to Florida, NY, PA, Ohio,Hawaii, or Alaska, and it has been extremely accurate. So for my money, I still rely on the GPS. I have had both Garmin and Magellan. I prefer Garmin. Thats my .02c"
811063,mistaredone,2013-10-05 21:19:00,913,"You need to update you iOS. Voice command and voice directions, traffic and construction alerts etc. way better"
811065,Bill Shearer,2013-10-05 21:32:00,456,"just did ios7, I will do that! Thanks!"
811066,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-05 21:43:00,10439,Your iphone won't work worth a tinkers damn where I am unless you just want to use it in town. Most of the areas up here have no cell service at all. Unless iphones now use satellites to get their fix instead of cell towers.
811068,Bill Shearer,2013-10-05 21:57:00,456,I was 50 miles outside of Terrace BC this spring. iPhone didn't work there either! Also unless you are willing to pay crazy roaming fees in the USA  GPS is still the better option
811089,Raycaster,2013-10-06 00:46:00,528,"Picking up a cheap or used 7"" android tablet with NavFree. You get free GPS that works without DATA fees etc. You also have a fine e-reader, movie viewer, email etc.  I have an older Nexus 7 which works awesome for GPS. Once out the car it comes with me and then its Navionics time for the boat!"
