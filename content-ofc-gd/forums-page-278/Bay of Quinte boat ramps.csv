811723,big daddy,2013-10-08 23:30:00,15,"Got a new (for me) boat set up for walleye fishing - so where do I go?  Bay of Quinte sounds hard to beat. I'm trying to plan a trip to BOQ before freeze up and will probably be staying in Picton, so can anyone tell me where the decent boat ramps with parking are in the area?  Thx."
811739,Cudz,2013-10-09 00:56:00,2652,Right in Belleville near the hospital. I think it is $6 Sorry.  Just saw you were in picton.  I know there is a marina on Big island with a ramp.
811741,Terry,2013-10-09 01:02:00,14456,"isn't the ramp beside tip of the bay still there, it was a  good ramp. just has to watch where you park and don't lock your keys in the truck"

811788,fishindevil,2013-10-09 07:18:00,6254,There is also the launch at Glenora right where the ferry crosses as well as McFarland conservation area and there is pryners east of pic ton as well and you can launch also over by bath !! Now listen closely !!!! The water level is down big time and most of the ramps have big drops at the end and guys are hanging up their trailers !!! Be careful !!!! I have crossed on the ferry many times and launched right there for years but depending on what direction the wind is Comming that can be an unpleasant place too !!!!! Or you can launch in deseronto and make the run down long reach !!!! Have you ever been to the BOQ before as it can get nasty in the fall down there quickly ?? If you need any more info you can shoot me a pm !!!!
811810,big daddy,2013-10-09 12:01:00,15,Thanks for all the info guys.  Got some choices at least.  Where would you say is the best ramp and parking anywhere on the Bay?
811823,Headhunter,2013-10-09 13:20:00,5703,"The best ramp at BOQ is the ramp least affected by that day's wind. Simply put, there are a number of ramps available, but you must choose the right location based on the wind that day. Another option to consider is the ramp on the north shore of Hay Bay. That ramp ""typically"" can be used most of the time as it is somewhat sheltered from the predominate west/northwest wind. Lost of parking and I believe a $5.00 honour system. Where you launch is also determined by the time of year you are fishing. Late November into December, you will most likely be fishing up-stream from the ferry... one line out per angler. HH"

812023,superdad,2013-10-10 15:14:00,353,have a look at this one:  http://www.fishingbayofquinte.com/maps/boat-ramps/  The Black River Ramp is closed.  The McFarlene park ramp has been comprimised by earth removal - take care - if it works at all.  David  aka  Superdad
812027,lew,2013-10-10 15:44:00,12766,"We  camped at Bass Cove Park for our annual spring Quinte trip for many many years and they've got a decent dirt ramp but I'm not sure when they close for the season.  Take the Adolphus Hiway a couple miles east of the ferry dock and turn north on hiway 8, then go 1 mile north to Dorland.  The camp is on your left side."
