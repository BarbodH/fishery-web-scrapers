Any first hand recommendations would be helpful. It's 2 couples (sans kids) and yes, post game shopping is on the ""menu"" as well.  Thanks gang."
811297,Sandbag,2013-10-06 22:30:00,533,"Hey Rob  Guess it depends on what you are looking for.  If it is Pizza and Wings type food, we quite often head to Mister B's in Niagara Falls, New York.  It is very close to the Military Road shopping malls etc.  It's not fancy, in fact it is an old house turned into a restaurant, however the food is very good.  Its located at corner of Hyde Park Road and ontario street.  Lot will be full of Ontario plates..hahaha  Cheers  Craig"
811302,kickingfrog,2013-10-06 22:36:00,8333,"I'll keep that place in mind. We're not tied to a ""type"" of restaurant but we'd prefer a non-chain or at least something different then what we can eat at in Ontario."
811413,blaque,2013-10-07 12:18:00,2419,"Duffs right down the road from the stadium at 5 corners. Hot wings, and hotter waitresses"
811415,F7Firecat,2013-10-07 12:31:00,347,Pearl Street Grill down by the arena is an awesome place
811417,Renegade67,2013-10-07 12:36:00,86,Mmmmm  Duffs wings.  Yum!

811482,blaque,2013-10-07 18:19:00,2419,"You can also check out Tony Rome's down the road for this bad boy. Ask for the ""beef and brew"" special.  Big ole' sammich, homemade chips, pickle and a big draft beer for $9.99   "
811484,blaque,2013-10-07 18:22:00,2419,"btw, i got three meals outta that thing. Grab some costanzas rolls down the street from the restaurant , your gonna need em for the leftover beef lol"
811485,Fang,2013-10-07 18:37:00,1330,"Two I have checked out from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives - Buffalo edition  Mulberry's cafe - Spectacular Italian and close to the stadium. Do not buy the regular Lasagna unless you are sharing for 2.  Grovers -  probably a bit far from stadium and line up was way too long for a burger - OK but the hype was bigger than the food"

Reason for never eating there, as you stated........it seats what seems like 12 people max lol (exaggerating....a little) and theres always at least 10 people waiting out front to get in.  Little history on the place.........It was originally Grover Clevelands hunting cabin"
811493,kickingfrog,2013-10-07 19:08:00,8333,Thanks for the ideas guys. It's good to have some options.
