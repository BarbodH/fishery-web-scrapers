I do miss the ice fishing for the last 10 years. Then around the middle of January I'll keep in touch by looking at the tablet after a round of golf sitting by the pool. Then I'll hit the Snook off the pier after supper, or Sea Trout or Amber Jack or ........ That should be hardware, this touch tablet thing is acting up again and I can't edit. Only on this site for some reason."

812082,Terry,2013-10-10 21:18:00,14456,this thread should be locked  using 4 letter woulds     snow   cold    can you even say that here  lets wait another month or so to speak the words and sing the traditional songs   oh winter net oh winter  net
812086,Bernie,2013-10-10 21:58:00,3190,Thats a good sized doghouse Chris I'd prefer a cold winter. At least it makes good ice and one can travel on the lake.That half rain/snow type weather is no good for anything.Too much snow also makes for slush on the lakes and that can be a real pain in the butt.
812087,misfish,2013-10-10 21:59:00,29133,"No winter net this year,,,,,,,,  Above norm temps for the next three months.  Sorry,me fault. New floater suit."
