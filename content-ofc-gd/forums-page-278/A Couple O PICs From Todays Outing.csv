Picked up a few good fish and a few little guys. Biggest fish of the day were over 20#'s  Only a few pics as my internet is super slow tonight for some reason (been uploading pic's for over an hour and they still aren't all uploaded yet).  First things first, got out to my new leased property to get some shots with my new UWA lens I just got for my DSLR. This first one is a 5 shot pano from the  boat of my lease.    Another pano taken from the location I intend to build.    Another pano from the highest spot on the site.    My favorite of the day. A 360* pano shot from the high spot on the site.    Looking West from the high spot. Looks to be some critter trails in here.    The Subhunter sitting where the floating dock is going.    Now some fishing related pics. This is me heading out this morning in the balmy +2C temps.    And a few fish pics. First fish of the day a 20+# pike.    And another in the 20# class. I landed this fish while the CO's were waiting to check my license and that my barbs were crushed.    OH, I got a trout too.    "

811399,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-07 03:05:00,10439,"Yep, it's a buzz bomb. They do work well fer de troots. I ended up getting most of my fish on it when I went camping in July."

811409,Gallie,2013-10-07 11:04:00,1215,Nice gators man!
811414,Rod Caster,2013-10-07 12:23:00,5784,That's quite the good looking rock on your lease. Daaaamn!  Sweet fish too. that trout easily weights more than all the lake trout I've ever caught.
811418,Renegade67,2013-10-07 12:44:00,86,Looks like a wicked lake.   Good luck with the build.
811443,solopaddler,2013-10-07 14:17:00,8605,Nice fish and beautiful spot. More importantly I can hardly recognize you! You really are losing a lot of weight aren't you? (It appears as though that jacket I mailed you a few years back fits perfect now  )
811450,TJQ,2013-10-07 14:37:00,7806,Your gonna be king on the hill!

It's funny 4X4 say's your lucky, well he's right, but it always seems the harder you work for something the luckier you get.  As for the fish? I hate ya, nice haul. 2C, it was only 24C here on the sunny north shore of Erie yesterday afternoon. I,d love to make you a trade for a few weeks one summer!"
