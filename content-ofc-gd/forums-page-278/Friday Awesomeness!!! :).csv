811049,Roy,2013-10-05 16:49:00,13728,"your so lucky i hope one day i get to enjoy my own land like that  And the smarter he works, the luckier he gets."
811124,BillM,2013-10-06 02:46:00,17367,Awesome Dave!  Looking forward to the build thread of the dock/cabin.
811191,Twocoda,2013-10-06 15:20:00,4130,Dave a few questions if you dont mind how big is the lot that you are leasing how much is a lease per year will the lease go up in price when there is a cottage on the property is the real estate and lease transferable to family or can it be sold outright to another person  Congrates on your new acquisition !!   There may be no grass to cut but granite is high maintenance to keep clean
811381,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-07 01:27:00,10439,Dave a few questions if you dont mind how big is the lot that you are leasing how much is a lease per year will the lease go up in price when there is a cottage on the property is the real estate and lease transferable to family or can it be sold outright to another person  Congrates on your new acquisition !!   There may be no grass to cut but granite is high maintenance to keep clean  70 meters X 70 meters (the nearest other allowable lease is 300 meters away) $152.50 No Yes Thanks
811398,Twocoda,2013-10-07 03:05:00,4130,wow im surprised the lease wont go up in cost once the building is erected (are you dealing with the canadian Gov or Natives ...is there an area on the property for installation of a septic system...how far away from civilization is the property...solar power ? wind gen? are you going to draw water from the lake or is a well possible? sorry man i dont mean to pry ....you dont have to answer...im just really curious as i would love to find something for the future when the time comes to break free from society as i know it now...but ...will still require some essentials like internet and cell service ....was there an initial cost of the land or private tendered bid? is there a website you found this property or just your own personal journeys led you to it ?  Thanks
811402,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-07 03:19:00,10439,"The lease is through the Federal Govt as it's crown land. They are transferring management to the NWT over the next few years and then the lease will carry over to the GNWT. No septic (outhouse) as it's all granite. No well, will draw from the lake like most Ontario cottages. Those of us who were following things new that the Feds were reopening leases after being closed for many years due to native land claims. I went out and searched for a spot and applied as soon as they started taking applications again. The few spots that were available on the lake I wanted to be on were gone quickly and if I had not been in the loop I would not have had a chance. It was like a gold rush when it reopened.  The lake is the biggest (other than Great Slave) lake close to town. My lease is at the far end from the launch about 14kms down the lake.  I only saw 3 boats out there today. 2 fishermen and the fish cops. They had to wait while I landed a 20# pike before they could check me out. "
811438,solopaddler,2013-10-07 14:10:00,8605,Maybe Solo will drop by and install your wood stove for the simple benefit of fishing your lake! It's been discussed Wayne.
811601,Twocoda,2013-10-08 05:18:00,4130,Thanks Dave ...i bet it was like a gold rush....well done ...now i need to get my arse in the loop ...lol...might mean ill have to delete my facebook account though if i want to make political friends...nice catch with the fishes (seen them in your other thread) and nice property...im going to assume 14 k to the boat launch is where the closest town is for supplies...im happy for ya ...when are you planning to start the build? Is there land access to the property in the summer months or will you haul your material in the winter over the ice
811608,RangerGuy,2013-10-08 11:45:00,564,Wow! Paradise! I can't wait to see how the cabin turns out...Congratulations man!   My wife an I were saying how nice it would be to have a  cabin/cottage!
811628,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-08 14:38:00,10439,Thanks Dave ...i bet it was like a gold rush....well done ...now i need to get my arse in the loop ...lol...might mean ill have to delete my facebook account though if i want to make political friends...nice catch with the fishes (seen them in your other thread) and nice property...im going to assume 14 k to the boat launch is where the closest town is for supplies...im happy for ya ...when are you planning to start the build? Is there land access to the property in the summer months or will you haul your material in the winter over the ice  14 km is to the highway. Yellowknife is  another 15 or 20 km. I can leave my place towing the boat and be at my cabin within an hour. No land access just boat in summer and ice road/ snowmobile in winter. The plan is to transport materials in early spring before the road disappears for the summer. Hoping to install dock and do foundation next year and close in the following year. Then I get to do the interior after that but will be able to work during the winter then.
811634,solopaddler,2013-10-08 16:19:00,8605,Best part is you'll have a substantial asset to sell when it finally comes time to leave Yellowknife. Very smart move!  On my end It'll be a nice place to visit.
811635,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-08 16:22:00,10439,"Best part is you'll have a substantial asset to sell when it finally comes time to leave Yellowknife. Very smart move!  On my end It'll be a nice place to visit.  Yep, should pay for my retirement property in the Bulkley valley in BC with enough left over for a jet boat and a drift boat."
811641,fishnsled,2013-10-08 16:33:00,3520,Looks fantastic!  Congrats!!
811650,Twocoda,2013-10-08 17:56:00,4130,sounds like you have a plan intact...Rome wasnt built in a day ....i can only imagine the price of building materials all the way up there...but im sure youll be capitalizing on any sales you come across...putting in a foundation should prove to be a challenge in itself (even with blocks) given the location and terrain...looking forward to following the thread along as your dream materializes
811736,Ron,2013-10-09 00:45:00,1683,"Very nice Dave!  As others have said, looking forward to the dock and cabin play by play.  Cheers...."
811749,pike slayer,2013-10-09 01:38:00,1177,all i can think of when ppl want to see play by play of the build is this old thread of the famous shed. http://www.bcsportbikes.com/forum/showthread.php/146566-Build-to-Fail-Fail-to-Build.-What-is-this-I-don-t-even..... you better take notes drifter and print out pictures.
811761,danbouck,2013-10-09 01:52:00,4380,If I can get there I am down for a good ol barn raising party
810971,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 22:09:00,10439,So back in March the Feds reopened the NWT to recreational leases and I applied on one of the best lakes near town. I got my lease papers to sign today and filled them in and returned them to the Feds for processing. Next week I will have binding lease in hand and can start the process of going broke building a dock and cabin to spend my free time at.  Here's my spot from space.   A view towards where the dock will be.   Good solid place to bolt the land end of the dock ramp to.   A view from the water to where the cabin will be.   A closer view.    Time to start running up the old credit card this winter.
810973,Christopheraaron,2013-10-04 22:13:00,3525,"You lucky bugger, LOL. Pike or lakers?"
810974,davey buoy,2013-10-04 22:13:00,5505,"WTG Dave,looks nice and quite there. Don't envy you putting in a foundation though.That has to be tough?.I hope you keep us updated."
810976,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 22:21:00,10439,"You lucky bugger, LOL. Pike or lakers?  Yes Whitefish too."
810977,Roy,2013-10-04 22:24:00,13728,"Now ya went and done it, Dave. The background is a dead giveaway....now everyone and his dog'll be pitchin' and flippin' under your dock!"
810978,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 22:25:00,10439,Foundation is yet to be determined. Probably going with short concrete piles anchored into the granite with epoxied in rebar. Then a permanent wood foundation set up on grade. This will be a crawl space under the cottage which will be 2 levels. Gonna be some work for sure.  Y'all wanna come and help?
810979,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 22:26:00,10439,You're  probably right Roy. I'm gonna have to put a bunch of old bed springs under there to help fill up my tackle box.
810981,Christopheraaron,2013-10-04 22:41:00,3525," Yes Whitefish too. Nice, inconnu aswell?  Foundation is yet to be determined. Probably going with short concrete piles anchored into the granite with epoxied in rebar. Then a permanent wood foundation set up on grade. This will be a crawl space under the cottage which will be 2 levels. Gonna be some work for sure.  Y'all wanna come and help? I'll come if you pay the ticket"
810982,kickingfrog,2013-10-04 22:45:00,8333,That would be awesome.
810983,irishfield,2013-10-04 22:48:00,26272,Looks like a gem Dave.. for the two months you won't be drilling through ice!  ...looks like a great place for a water slide as well!
810985,Rod Caster,2013-10-04 23:05:00,5784,"Hope it'll have  an ice road.  Congrats that is one sweet piece of real estate!!  Like Chris said, u pay the ticket there and I'll help you build whatever the heck you want."
810986,Musky or Specks,2013-10-04 23:13:00,2710,Sounds like a dream come true for you. You are a lucky man
810987,TJQ,2013-10-04 23:16:00,7806,Good... im gonna need a place to crash...
810990,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 23:43:00,10439,"Aye, she has an ice road bye. It runs right past the cabin about 1km out. I can park there in the winter and ride my sled into the cabin. In the open water season it is a 14km trip from the launch.  If you look to the right of this picture you can see where the road goes into the bush and behind the spindly tree is a car on the road. This pic was taken the end of the first week in March this year when I was scoping out places to put a cabin.  "
810992,adempsey,2013-10-04 23:52:00,1498,"Nice!  Unfortunately, it's now taken!    Looks like a great spot though.  Looking forward to your build thread."

811012,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-05 02:16:00,10439,Pretty clear Any time Nope only 5ft long auger.
