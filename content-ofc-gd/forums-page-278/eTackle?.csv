810857,BillM,2013-10-04 02:01:00,17367,"I don't think Phil has shut down Etackle, I'm sure he'll chime in.  Website still works, etc."
810858,Sinker,2013-10-04 02:03:00,8692,"Yep. I've never ordered anything from there though. Doesn't sound like something he would do, so who knows what's going on.  S."
810865,Roy,2013-10-04 03:00:00,13728,Talk to their Pro Staff advisory team.....they should know what's going on. http://www.etackle.ca/pro-staff-advisory-team/
810866,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-04 03:07:00,10439,I've ordered a bunch of stuff through Phil and always had great service. I don't have one bad word to say about him or his operation.
810874,singingdog,2013-10-04 10:22:00,1047,"The site may still be up, but is pretty much non-responsive in my experience: no returned emails on several occasions."
810875,Lake Ranger,2013-10-04 10:47:00,70,"Copied from E-Tackle Deal Dock on Ebay.        No doubt about it, something is going on. Great guy and all, but I've been duped big time and it looks like others have been too. Unfortunately, just because someone is trying hard to do a good job, doesn't always mean they will. Honesty is the best policy. If you can't provide a product or service someone is expecting of you or paying for, don't take the money and run. At the very least, keep the lines of communication open, most people will understand if there is some sort of upkeep with contact to show the intent to come through with the goods."
810891,MCTFisher9120,2013-10-04 12:38:00,3761,I believe the women in the family tell me they have a table at a Flea Market here in the GTA...can't remember what one but they were there most weekends earlier in the summer.
810901,206,2013-10-04 13:46:00,563,"Sorry to hear you had a bad experience... But Positive  270  Neutral  4  Negative  5 Positive Feedback (last 12 months): 97.7%  I don't think that's bad, lotta scam artists out there claim not to receive things  No control over mail system.  I fail to believe Phil has intentionally try'd to rip anyone off!!"
810907,Lake Ranger,2013-10-04 14:14:00,70,"I too, honestly don't believe there's any 'intention' of ripping anyone off. I just wish people who make promises will at least try and make the effort to communicate, explain and make arrangements to resolve the situation."
810916,Sinker,2013-10-04 15:15:00,8692, Sounds a little sketchy to me.....yikes!  S.
810936,irishfield,2013-10-04 17:16:00,26272,"A family comes first situation that isn't anyone's business here and I'm sure Phil will come good for product / answer emails / etc when time permits. Bad mouthing him while he works out some other stuff isn't going to help anyone, or get people product any quicker."
810938,Roy,2013-10-04 17:21:00,13728,"So far, I haven't heard of anyone on this site complaining about Phil's service. As this comes from somewhere else, let's give him the benefit of the doubt for the time being and if anyone here IS getting the runaround, then you know where to reach him."
810939,BucktownAngler,2013-10-04 17:22:00,582,"peo  A family comes first situation that isn't anyone's business here and I'm sure Phil will come good for product / answer emails / etc when time permits. Bad mouthing him while he works out some other stuff isn't going to help anyone, or get people product any quicker.  im sure most people dont know phil or his situation. they just know etackle isnt coming through for them.  no different then ""bad mouthing"" sail or BPS"
810945,aplumma,2013-10-04 18:15:00,6896,Phil made sure I had a few special lures before I went up to Canada this year in August. If you think you have gotten less than stellar service contact Phil he is a stand up guy and will make it right I am sure.   Art
