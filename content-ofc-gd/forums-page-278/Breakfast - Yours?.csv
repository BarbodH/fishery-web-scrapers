811268,ketchenany,2013-10-06 20:54:00,3229,"Light coffee while I read the epapers. At work yogurt with cut up fruit, different every day. Snack on fruit all day long. Occationally on the weekend toast and eggs."
811270,woodenboater,2013-10-06 21:21:00,2277,"Weekdays is usually PC Ancient Grains cereal or peanut butter (crunchy) on multi grain toast. If I'm camping, there will be two sunny side eggs, runny with bacon (chewy)  or sausage. Tea or pressed or perk coffee with Baileys.  Like others, green tea but rotate it out with Chinese black tea or Jasmine tea.  Chad, try Yama Moto Yama green tea (sencha or genmai-cha), very nice."
811279,Rod Caster,2013-10-06 22:09:00,5784,"Funny you say that, my wife's favorite green tea is genmaicha. Apparently the rice in the tea was originally used as a filler in times of austerity or when green tea was in short supply.   We eat a lot of that PC AG bread as well. A squirrels favorite."

I make a little of my own real maple syrup, but I actually prefer the cheap no-name brand stuff, even Aunt Jemima doesn't cut it, that's just me though  I also prefer cheap beer (no Moosehead or Sleemans etc), homemade wine  to LCBO stuff, cheap rye not Crown Royal,  I don't know if my cheapness has influenced my perception, or I'm just a red neck"
811393,Burtess,2013-10-07 02:24:00,901,"During the week some kind of toasted bagel / toast / English muffin with peanut butter.  Weekends its easy over eggs, and I have become one of the hot sauce bunch...... a really good one, although not very hot, is the Chipotle Tabasco.  A really nice smokey flavour.  For added protein I like peameal bacon or a thin cut med. steak (don't like blood on the eggs!!!).  Burt"

Don't usually eat it until I get to work so I take it in a tupperware container with a jar of milk and the banana then make it at my desk.  And a Coke Zero of course or a decaf coffee if the guys at work go pick up coffee.  Now when I'm on Vaca, I love two eggs, sunny side up, hash browns made with real potatoes and fried in butter with spices, bacon (peameal or regular) and toast."

Also I typically eat my morning food ASAP, like minutes after I wake up. Can't imaging waiting unitl lunch like some people do!!  #1 morning food - Three sunny side up eggs with lots of pepper, three pieces of toast the last one with PB and jam,  #2 three egg omlett cooked in olive oil, no bread, tons of veggies and spices and seeds like turmeric, pepper, chia seeds, hemp seeds, sesame. This is my healthy Brek.  #3 if I'm short on time, some goofy kids cereal mixed with another cereal with actual substance like Oatmeal Crunch.   Morning Drink: Green Tea! I use the loose leaf stuff from David's Tea and it just so damn good compared to the sticks/dead leaf green tea from the bags.  "
810879,lew,2013-10-04 11:44:00,12766,Normally toast & cereal but this morning I'm having one of my favorites which is poached eggs on toast with cheese whiz on the toast before the egg.  Don't cringe until you try it

810895,NAW,2013-10-04 12:58:00,4022,"A coffee gets chugged immediately upon waking up.  But I have to wait at least an hour before I eat something.   By that time I'm at work, so it's usually just a cereal bar and a rice crispy square, or a muffin.  On the weekends, I love pancakes with local maple syrup. I stock up each spring at the Elmvale maple syrup festival.  The odd time I'll go all out.  Eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, hash browns and fruit...  But that's usually only the day after a big party, in attempt to get the hung over people out of my house!"

Home made Waffles with cinnamon and maple syrup 4. Poached eggs on toast with bacon 5. Toasted western sandwich 6. Scrambled eggs with hash browns , sausages and toast 7. Fruit breakfast, bananas, apples and grapes. Add any seasonal fruit also  Those are my regulars. Always a coffee when I wake up(can't find the planet without it) and one more with breakfast. Fruit breakfast is a must at least once a week. I always eat a good breakfast and then have a light lunch(usually fruit).  Muddler"

Breakfast like that you don't have to come off the lake till dark, no lunch or supper, just a few beers before bed time. Some days when I feel health conscious, Red River cereal or Oatmeal Porridge with brown sugar. Put like some mention just a coffee on the run and make it happen, get the boat on the truck and lets ""GO""   , lots of time to eat latter, times-a-wastin, fishis to be caught And make sure the boat tank is full, dark is a long time off.
