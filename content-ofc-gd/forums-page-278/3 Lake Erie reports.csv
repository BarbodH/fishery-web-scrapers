810406,corvette1,2013-10-01 23:02:00,1765,Two weeks ago we went walleye fishing on Lake Erie.  Kevin and I got 16 walleye.  Last Wednesday and Saturday we went perch fishing and got 100 perch each trip out. Wednesday was the best perch fishing I ever had....got 100 perch in three hours.  Perch fishing has been on fire.

810469,Moosebunk,2013-10-02 03:46:00,3970,That was short and sweet with tonnes of meat.  Some solid catching out there man!
810517,ch312,2013-10-02 15:12:00,1590,"but who likes to clean all that perch!   With an electric fillet knife it takes about 30-40 seconds per fish to have boneless fillets...   Besides, it's a perfect excuse to have a few beers with your buddy after a day of fishing. "
810811,Rod Caster,2013-10-03 21:32:00,5784,I could use 100 perch just about now! But I'll have to wait for Nipissing to freeze over.  Enjoy the awesome fishing!
