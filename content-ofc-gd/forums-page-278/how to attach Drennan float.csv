811576,redpearl99,2013-10-08 01:04:00,259,"I found a 6.4g Drennan Loafer float in the water today but I dont know how to properly attach it.  It has a small place on the bottom of the float for the fishing line to go through, but there isnt a spot on the top of the float.  Im use to the redwing tackle floats where you attach the line at the top and the bottom"
811579,BillM,2013-10-08 01:09:00,17367,":EDIT:  Burtess is right, I was thinking of the Drennan Zepplins."
811580,Burtess,2013-10-08 01:11:00,901,You can rig it at the top and bottom like the Redwing floats you have used.  Just need larger tubing or elastic for the top.  Burt
811586,MJL,2013-10-08 01:38:00,2427,"What Burtess said. Many tackle shops in the GTA sell those packs with multiple diameter/size tubings specifically for the Drennan floats. On that note, you can save some $ by buying generic tubing in the diameters that you just need (tackle shops and many hardware stores carry it).  I sold off all my Drennan Loafers for almost nothing mostly because I couldn't stand using 2 different sizes of tubing.LOL"
811598,redpearl99,2013-10-08 03:50:00,259,"well that sucks, im not gonna go buy different tubing for one float"
811604,misfish,2013-10-08 10:44:00,29133,"I have used those tiny little clear hair elastics. it works,thats all that matters."
811734,Ron,2013-10-09 00:34:00,1683,I use the balloon animal balloons. Cheap at the dollar store. Cut piece off and roll it up on the float. Works great.
811742,Canuck2fan,2013-10-09 01:05:00,1444,As mentioned you can buy packs of tubing with all different sizes. I found it to be one of the better investments in fishing tackle. Mainly because I have found just as many floats as I have lost over the years. The found ones don't always come in the size and shape you purchase LOL...
811809,porkpie,2013-10-09 11:59:00,2521,"Loafers are a pita and I don't buy them.  Avons aren't bad, but you need a little larger diameter tubing for them, but it will work top and bottom so I can live with it!  I carry 2 styles of tubing bought in bulk.  If it won't fit into those 2 styles of tubing, I won't use it!  Loafers don't fit so their out!"
811989,Joeytier,2013-10-10 11:20:00,3990,Yup.  Take a walk down the smaller GTA tribs in July and you'll never buy floats again.
811995,BillM,2013-10-10 12:05:00,17367,"Yup. Take a walk down the smaller GTA tribs in July and you'll never buy floats again.  I love finding floats, it's like Xmas!!  LOL!"
812006,steelhedrmatt,2013-10-10 13:11:00,278,Yup. Take a walk down the smaller GTA tribs in July and you'll never buy floats again. We used to use a canoe and an extendable tree trim pole.  works awesome.
