811591,nancur373,2013-10-08 01:58:00,1211,Hey guys. I want to challenge the hunter exam. I had my license in NFLD but need to take the test here. Does anyone have a Hunter Education Manual kicking around I could buy or borrow? Thanks  Curt
811599,Sinker,2013-10-08 04:05:00,8692,If you had your license down home you will easily be able to challenge the test and pass. No need to take the whole course.  Do you have your firearms license?  S.
811609,nancur373,2013-10-08 11:57:00,1211,I do have a PAL. I just want to go over the book. It's been 15 years since I did the course.

811631,ch312,2013-10-08 15:13:00,1590,"I had no clue that anyone was able to challenge the hunter exam. Ya learn something new every day...    Q. I have moved to Ontario from another jurisdiction (i.e. Nova Scotia), I have resided in Ontario as a permanent resident for more than six consecutive months in the previous twelve and I have a license issued to me from that jurisdiction, does that help? If you can produce a Resident License or Hunter Education certificate, issued to you after January 1, 1968 from another jurisdiction, you may challenge the Hunter Education examination one time without attending the Ontario Hunter Education course. If you fail to successfully complete this examination, you will be required to take the Hunter Education course and be reexamined."
