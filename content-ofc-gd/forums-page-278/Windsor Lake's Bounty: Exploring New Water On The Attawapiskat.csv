Lots of respectable pike and some of the pics remind me of a big widened area around Bear Island waaaaaay down river by the town.  There just aren't many places if any at all that aren't beautiful to view along that river.  Camp looks better than envisioned.  MNR... what can ya say???  I found it odd for ya dood for as I said, they came in on us every year on the Kesagami ice, and were always awesome.  One thing to be said about ya Mike, you're a handy guy out there with these camps.  You seem to get in and out of things easy, and in a good stride.  Cool to see Ricky & Julian tippin' some drinks and deep frying fishy dinks with ya.  Another gem of a trip under your belt Mister!"

809922,solopaddler,2013-09-29 18:20:00,8605,"Poring over maps has always been a favorite pastime of mine, especially when planning trips in Ontario's far north. Looking over a detailed topographic map of Windsor lake, a widening of the fabled Attawapiskat River, the opportunities seemed endless. It encompasses thousands upon thousands of acres of fishable water, and with the obvious potential for trophy fish it's a destination that's long intrigued me.  Last year Eddie North acquired an older outpost camp on Windsor lake, his goal being to open it up to anglers in 2014. Life, not unexpectedly, tends to throw us a curve every once in a while, and when a proposed September trip to northern Saskatchewan fell through Eddie stepped up to the plate.  ""How would you guys feel about fishing Windsor in mid September? The camp isn't completely ready for guests yet, but it's in decent shape and I'd love to see what the fishing is really like before I open it up next year!""  Pretty easy decision for me. A call to my friend Joe, and two other board members, Rick and Julian had the cast of characters quickly pinned down.  We'd be fishing Windsor on the week of September 13. With the full moon on the 20th and blessed with a favorable weather forecast expectations were running high...    An Inauspicious Start  As the otter banked and began its descent onto Windsor I was struck by two things: Water, its course convoluted in nature and littered with islands, stretched in every direction as far as the eye could see. Also evident were thousands upon thousands of rocks. The river was obviously low and presented a literal mine field of hazards.  The pilot, a capable young woman, circled the camp and merely shook her head. ""No way we're landing there!"" With nothing else said she dropped the plane onto a rock-free zone and taxied over to a beach a good kilometer east of the camp.  With the wind blowing she hopped out barefoot with a rope as we watched.     We quickly followed suit shedding our shoes and socks and jumping into the frigid water to help unload the plane. Visions of Castaway popped to mind as in short order our gear was piled high on the beach along with two motors and a drum of gas. Of course we had no boats, they were at the outpost camp.  ""Good luck gentlemen, hope you have a great week!"" And with that she revved the engine and was quickly gone, a tight schedule to maintain.    Rick quickly set out along the shoreline heading for the outpost camp, his goal being to get one of the boats and paddle or pole it back to beach.  We busied ourselves organizing gear and donning dry socks and boots, and in no time at all it seemed we heard a whoop from Rick as he turned the point with one of the boats.    We quickly had one of the outboards clamped onto the transom and began loading our gear. It took a couple of trips to complete the task, but we were soon unloaded at the camp and quickly set about unpacking and settling in.  As promised the camp was in decent shape, and with a bit of work it has the potential to be great. Still, there were a few issues that needed attention. First order of business being installing the woodstove.    A bit of sweeping and  cleaning, some screening tacked up onto a couple of open windows in the screen porch, some dry wood cut and split and we were good to go, we were home for a week. The dock, while in good shape, was left mostly high and dry with the low water so we had to improvise there too. Fortunately for us there were two old log boat ramps set back high on the bank and buried in the weeds. With a bit effort we dragged them both down to the waters edge, one on each side of the dock. They would prove to be an ideal substitute.     With our chores out of the way we put our tackle together and readied the boats, it was time to fish.    A Plethora Of Pike  When I'm fishing a location that has the potential to produce a trophy pike on any given cast I find it difficult to fish for anything else and this trip was no exception. The problem was where to find them? With such a vast amount of territory to explore and fish eliminating unproductive water and quickly establishing a pattern was essential.  Being familiar with the pike in this system I knew that bays or feeding shelves directly adjacent to main river channel and associated current were key. A large percentage of this waterway is comprised of backwater areas, some kilometers away from the deeper water and current. While I'm sure they'd be hotspots early in the season, it was an easy task eliminating them in September.  Still there was a lot of water to cover, and cover it we did exploring every inch both upstream and down from camp.   Not unexpectedly we were somewhat constrained by the low water. Many channels which would otherwise be navigable, were high and dry.     Still, the navigable water was endless and we enjoyed every minute spent exploring it.        Being September and in the midst of a prime moon phase I wasn't anticipating finesse to play a big role and that proved true.  Casting spinnerbaits, inline bucktails, a variety of spoons and occasionally 6 inch twister tails along deep weed edges and always adjacent to current we found success. Copious amounts of large, aggressive and willing pike came to play.                             ​                                     A Windfall Of Walleye  With such phenomenal pike fishing the walleye by and large took a back seat. That however doesn't diminish the quality of the fishery. Elsewhere on the Attawapiskat I've caught trophy sized fish, many in the 7-10lb class. While on Windsor we never did capture any behemoths, but the numbers were unprecedented. Windsor in a nutshell is a bona fide walleye factory. If you strictly concentrated on them you could easily catch 100 a day. Mostly in the 17-21"" range, with a handful larger, Windsor's walleye are fat, feisty and will seemingly hit anything.  As always I brought a flat of worms with me, but they were completely unnecessary. Ultimately we mostly used 4"" Fin S Fish and Northland minnows. Run clean on a 1/4 or 3/8 oz head they inflicted grievous harm on the walleye population.  Every single current area, and there were lots of them, held scads of hungry walleye.             ​    ​  ​                           Breathtaking Vistas And An Unexpected Visitor  The terrain at Windsor is something special. Mile upon mile of convoluted twisting water interspersed with countless islands, neck downs and current areas all set in a backdrop of northern taiga. It has a wild feel, a true sense of remoteness and quite easily gets under your skin. It's a special place.                   ​   Late one evening around 7:30 Joe and I were working a small rock pile not far from camp when we heard the unmistakable drone a float plane drawing closer. With less than an hour of light left and being so far north we were surprised to say the least.  It circled it overhead then quickly landed about a kilometer away.  I knew it wasn't Nakina Air and honestly didn't quite know what to expect as I fired up the outboard to drive over and greet them. It never dawned on me for a moment that it was the MNR, I honestly would have been less surprised to see a pink unicorn land on the lake.  They were on a milk run that day hitting up all the remote outpost camps to check on the occupants. Windsor being the furthest north was their last stop of the day before flying back to Geraldton. With the sun sinking fast they were polite enough gent's, but a bit rushed.  When asked if they could check our cabin for fish, I told them sure no problem, but you'll have to hop into my boat if you want to.  ""Why's that?"" asked older guy in charge.  ""Water's too low, you can't dock your plane at the camp"" says I.  ""Never mind then"" says older guy in charge.  After checking our boat thoroughly as well as our licenses older guy asks what's in the thermos?  I had one beside me in the boat filled with coffee as the day had been cold.  He unscrews the lid, smells it, then says ""I think we have a problem.""  ""Really, why?"" says I.  ""It appears as though there's Bailey's in your coffee sir!""  I explained to him that it was actually French Vanilla flavored Coffeemate.  ""How sure are you that's Coffeemate sir?""  ""100% sure, although I wish I had some Bailey's right about now.""  He looked at me kind of dubiously as he handed the thermos back. My impression was that I had just narrowly escaped some big trouble.  Nevertheless we chatted pleasantly for a spell before they went on their way.      Tax payers dollars hard at work!   The Camp And A Tip Of The Hat To The Boys  As I've said the Windsor outpost is nice, but has the potential to be truly great with a small amount of cleaning and fixing. For our purposes it was an ideal venue, and being a single cabin outpost on such an outstanding body of water I'll definitely be back.  For those of you interested in a trip to Windsor I shot this short video tour of the camp:     The outfitter is Eddie North out of Nakina and his contact info can be found on his website at eddienorth.com  Once again a big thank you to Eddie who has always been a pleasure to deal with, especially this time accommodating us at the very last minute.  You're a good man my friend and I'm sure we'll do it again!   Finally I'd like to thank Joe, Rick and Julian. You guys made this trip extra special and I'm sure there'll be more.   Cheers boys!         Hope you enjoyed,   Mike       "
