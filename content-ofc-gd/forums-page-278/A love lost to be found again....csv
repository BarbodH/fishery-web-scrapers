811134,irishfield,2013-10-06 03:51:00,26272,Can we get through fall first please.... 2.5 months of Musky hunting yet before any ice cometh !
811138,fishindevil,2013-10-06 07:11:00,6254,Ya for sure Wayne !!!! Still lots of open water to fish yet with no citiots & sea doos !!! Fall fishing is just starting to get good !!!!! Then it's snowmobiling season !!!!! Awesome .... When you are a multi species fisherman like myself it's alwAys game on !!!!! And when the boat gets put away its sledding time !!!! I know some bass tourney guys that only fish from June bass opener till Labor Day weekend !!!!! They miss so much fishing and only target bass !!!!! I'm just getting geared up for fall walleyes yet !!!! Tight-lines guys

811198,ehg,2013-10-06 15:48:00,2666,"  Anyone else fighting the same feelings???  I would rather spend my time with a REAL sweet girl by a fireplace in winter.  Maybe it's just me but icefising is kinda overrated. Stuck in one place, no casting, freezing, etc...."
811203,BillM,2013-10-06 15:55:00,17367,Steelheading has barely begun and we are worried about icefishing?  Not to mention fall bass season!
811205,Moosebunk,2013-10-06 16:12:00,3970,"Gimme time in the boat to January 1st.  Then skip that month entirely, giving Feb & March only for ice, then back into the boat April 1st.    And umm ohhhhhhh.... DON'T ever post that background of my spot EVER AGAIN."
811223,lew,2013-10-06 16:48:00,12766,"I'd like to see winter & snow on Christmas Eve then jump right into Spring the next day.  Ice belongs in my COKE, not under my feet"

811230,lew,2013-10-06 17:25:00,12766,HAHAHA
811231,misfish,2013-10-06 17:37:00,29133," Being the manly man that Lew is, he doesn’t need anything to keep warm from the cold  You been watching the old Spice commercial to much.LOL"
811234,MJL,2013-10-06 18:07:00,2427," You been watching the old Spice commercial to much.LOL  No Brian…But if that was the case, it would go something like:  ""Hello Ladies. Look at your man. Then back to Lew. Then back to your man. Then back to Lew. Sadly, your man isn’t Lew.  But if your man started using a Shimano Calcutta for a muskie reel, he could be like Lew. Look down. Then Back to Lew. A 65lb Muskie in your hand. But wait, that 65lb muskie is now 75lbs. Anything is possible when you’re Lew. Lew’s in a Lund.""  And to the OP, while I'm definitely looking forward to this coming ice season, there's still a ton more steelheading to be done!"
811242,lew,2013-10-06 18:48:00,12766," Anything is possible when you’re Lew. Lew’s in a Lund.""  Actually Mike, it's a Skeeter, but your story is hilarious"
