810590,super dave,2013-10-02 22:27:00,323,Does anyone know what the water level is at mountsberg?   I know they drain it in the fall.  Wondering if that happened yet.

Usually it is not too bad but I seem to recall last year, around this time, it was quite murky?  Perhaps it was caused by the fall drain that Super Dave eluded to?"
