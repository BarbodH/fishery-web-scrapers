82187,jediangler,2007-06-11 04:01:00,1923,"Welcome to the board. Try a 6"" piece of electrical tape on your spool after you make your first cast. Wind the tape on the spool as you reel in. This way you can't cast past this point and shouldn't have any problems. Other than that, keep adjusting your brakes/magnets until you get the hang of it. If it gets you down, go back to a spinning rod. You can pick up the baitcaster again later on. If you are frustrated you won't enjoy yourself and that's what it's all about. Good luck."
82220,motv8tr,2007-06-11 07:56:00,2587,"Welcome sunfish, you picked the right place to start your fishing addiction  .  As for your baitcaster, set the drag so that when you release the line, the lure will fall at an easy steady speed and the reel will stop spinning once the lure hits the water.  Also, try not to have too much of a ""flick of the wrist"" action, try to make it a smooth cast, this has helped me.  I'm sure others will do a better job of explaining, but I hope this helps.  Again, welcome to the board, Maureen"

82869,ccmtcanada,2007-06-12 16:55:00,7971,"Sunfish...welcome to the board!  I too am recently back into fishing and purchased my first baitcaster myself.  They are not easy to learn that's for sure!  I figured out how NOT to get birdsnests, I just have no distance to it right now.  I'm a little paranoid about them, so I find I thumb the spool to much....haha.  Just have to get out there and practise....twist my arm!!! LOL"

82897,setomonkey,2007-06-12 17:43:00,872,"Welcome to the board...  One more tip, when you are first learning to cast a baitcaster, there's no point in investing in good (expensive) line, b/c you will get birdsnests and sometimes will have to cut line out.  I put on heavier mono at the beginning as I found it was easier to learn how to cast with it, and then switched to thinner lines with experience (but I still birdsnest sometimes!)  The only other thing I can recommend is to practice. I put on a heavy jig and cut off the hook, and then took it to a local park in the early spring to practice with it. I got some pretty good looks but it meant I was better prepared when I was actually on the water. I wasn't doing any fishing in Feb or March anyway so it did give me something fishing related to do as well.  Mike"
