82979,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-12 21:12:00,4399,Just bought my new power drive and the sales guy suggested I try the quick nuts to fasten it down so I took the bait. So my question is has anybody used them and what do you think about them?  TIA
82992,Roy,2007-06-12 21:45:00,13728,They are handy for when you don't have a lot of space to work with but I think they are plastic also and I'd worry about the torque on the base. IMHO
