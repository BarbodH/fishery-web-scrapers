83388,Fishnfiend,2007-06-13 19:43:00,357,Awesome pictures.  Thanks for sharing.  I have seen them MANY times and have never even attempted taking a picture.  Perhaps next time.  I usually just stare in amazement and never think to take a picture.

83401,MJL,2007-06-13 20:12:00,2427,I'm sure there's a few people out there thinking that they must be high on some form of illicit mind-altering drug.  Those pics are amazing
