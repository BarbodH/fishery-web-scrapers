82849,misfish,2007-06-12 16:35:00,29133,A couple grand at the most. You can buy that type of boat anywhere these days.

82855,tizfun,2007-06-12 16:43:00,292,Trailer looks a bit small..  $3000.00 tops..... I'm being gererous here....  Tiz
82868,Zamboni,2007-06-12 16:54:00,235,"Looks clean-its value depends on engine and lower end condition. Test drive, if that goes well then pay a mechanic to look it over, at very least do a compression test yourself.  Lots of fun in a boat like that if its mechanically sound-fish,ski, tube-swimming platform for kids....great for family. That bimini is nice to have-I need one. There are lots of boats like that around, make sure you choose one without major problems.  What is asking price?"
82875,Billy Bob,2007-06-12 17:05:00,5865,It looks HEAVY to tow and launch.
82876,Bernie,2007-06-12 17:07:00,3190,How much gas is in it?   JK
82879,misfish,2007-06-12 17:09:00,29133, Must be yer boat eh Tony. LOL
82880,Terry,2007-06-12 17:10:00,14456,"looks like it's been looked after boat cover, top, good looking trailer but the trailer is way to short for the boat.............. is it a bowrider?"
82883,misfish,2007-06-12 17:13:00,29133," Looks like it,I see a 3 piece WS.  Yea that trailer looks a wee bit small there,then again,maybe thats the way it is.Never know.Rollers are supporting the transom pretty good."
82953,FishFinder,2007-06-12 19:49:00,481,"Would it be suitable for trolling on lake O, or is it too small/old/unreliable"
82960,douG,2007-06-12 20:10:00,2693,"That depends on the wind strength, direction, your launch point etc.  It looks fine for most fishable conditions, but would have some difficulty fishing those six foot swells we get if the wind is from the south, or worse, from the east."
