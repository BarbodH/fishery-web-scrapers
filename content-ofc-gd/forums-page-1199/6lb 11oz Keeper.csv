For those that I've met at the London Swills, you know she definetly gets her looks from mama! Lack of sleep?  I'm a Truck Driver, I get used to it pretty quick!  Lack of fishing?  I had planned to take the boat out for a short cruise today (Sunday) but I think I'll save it for the Sunday of Bass opener.  I already got the OK from the wifey. BTW the above picture contains one of the few things in this world that a truck DOESN'T deliver! (OK maybe the lack of sleep is getting to me)  jjcanoe"
