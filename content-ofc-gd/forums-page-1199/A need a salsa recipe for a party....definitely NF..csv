83183,aplumma,2007-06-13 11:07:00,6896,"This is  a vinegar based salsa that is not overpowering .  3 tomato's seeded, chopped, strainer rinsed and patted dry.  1 large onion chopped  2 plum sized Timoteo's ( optional green mexican type vegetable)  1- 4 oz fresh cilantros, minced add to taste preference.  1/2 oz of  minced chipolta if you want it spicy but try it without first.  1 oz lemon juice mix together and add to above for desired liquid content 3 oz  apple vinegar  set for at least 3 hours or overnight for flavor to blend."
83185,Billy Bob,2007-06-13 11:11:00,5865,"OK, I have a salsa recipe but the aplumma gave you looks fine. What I need to know is what does ""NF"" in your post mean. I have seen it several other times and I finally had to ask."
83217,JFR,2007-06-13 12:45:00,498," Billy Bob, the ""N/F"" stands for non fishing topic.  It alerts the readers, and they can read or ignore.  Pam, that recipe sounds fantastic."
83266,douG,2007-06-13 14:56:00,2693,"I like this one Pam.  It uses lime rather than lemon, essential to salsa imo.  Blend jalapeño, cilantro and garlic until fine.   2 jalapeño peppers, to start with 4 sprigs of cilantro 2 to 3 garlic cloves   Add the onion and bell pepper to above mixture and whirl until chunky.   ¼ onion, coarsely chopped ¼ green bell pepper, coarsely chopped   Next I add tomatoes to above mixture and blend until chunky.   4 to 5 roma tomatoes   Lastly I add lime juice and salt to taste.   juice of ½ a lime salt, to taste    The salsa has a bit more body if you remove the juicier bits of the tomatoes first.  A nice partner to the salsa if you are serving with nachos is guacamole.  YUM!"
83319,Kirk,2007-06-13 16:59:00,347,"I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, canned are softer and more suited to salsa (my taste anyways)  Lets not forget green onions as well"
83320,mpt,2007-06-13 17:01:00,158,Definately use the tommatillos. It really adds a unique flavor.
83405,Weeds,2007-06-13 20:15:00,782,"Non traditional but good- Mango and pineapple diced, a few limes squeezed, a little red onion and red pepper for colour and cilantro (corriander) if you like it. Salt and pepper to taste. Hot peppers if you wish (Jalapenos, chili's, whatever) Tastes fresh, looks good.  More traditional- Pico de Gaillo- Tomatoes (whatever you've got) diced, a little onion, garlic, cilantro and lots of lime juice. Chipotle peppers in adobo if you happen to have em or whatever hot pepper you've got.  Simple and good."
