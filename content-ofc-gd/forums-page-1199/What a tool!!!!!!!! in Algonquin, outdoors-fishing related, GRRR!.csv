83077,Nemo,2007-06-13 00:43:00,727,Funny Story but it was in Quetico not APP.  Just like the idiots that spray painted Maple Mountain in Temagami.  They caught them sort of.. the same way.
83132,holdfast,2007-06-13 03:05:00,1813,Kind of brings up a question I have.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  There was a huge old Pine tree that was famous as a one of Tom Thompson's famous portraits.  A unique Canadian Treasure.  I believe this tree was on Grand Lake in Achray.  Can somebody shed some light on how this tree was cut down.  Apparently campers.
