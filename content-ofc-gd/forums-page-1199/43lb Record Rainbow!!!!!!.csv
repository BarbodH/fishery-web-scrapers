82817,Terry,2007-06-12 15:04:00,14456,espn has old news  ofncommunity.com beat them by a week  record rainbow trout  but it is a pig
82824,mart,2007-06-12 15:37:00,93,I remember reading the post here. I just missed seeing a picture of the beast. That must of been a blast catching it on 6lb test.

82898,setomonkey,2007-06-12 17:46:00,872,That thing is grotesque!  But it would have been a helluva fight I bet...  Mike
82905,HookNrelease,2007-06-12 17:51:00,85,"well i have some real nice photos of the fish from the night it was landed, however at this time ESPN among a whole host of other sponsors have signed up all the rights to all pictures and info, so unfortunately without the right logos on each picture i cant post them as hoped, ah well im sure they will all come out sooner or later"
82906,Fishmaster,2007-06-12 17:59:00,920,Farm raised fish i would have to say ..
