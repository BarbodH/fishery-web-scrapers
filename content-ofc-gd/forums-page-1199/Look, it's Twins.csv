81710,Spiel,2007-06-09 18:27:00,9065,"....Well as most of you may recall we had a announcement back in February titled A Summer to Remember to which we would make this summer a special one for Speedtroll's (Rob) son Chris.  I promised to build a rod for Chris and I have but I also built one for his daughter Nicole as I felt she was also deserving of having something special to share in the joy while on those family fishing trips. Now I was prepared to do this on my own accord but as it turns out my good friend Lorne Greene owner of Loomis Canada donated me the materials for Chris' rod and our very own board member Skiel offered and sent me a cheque covering the material costs for the second rod. A tip of my hat and my sincerest thanks to these two gentlemen for the extreme generousity. So for me it was just finding time to assemble them and I finally have them both completed.  In fact Rob was hoping to come by today with his kids to receive the rods but unfortunately it'll have to wait for another day.  So here's a few pictures of the rods Chris and Nicole will be using this summer. They are identical with the exception of color, graphite grey for Chris and candy apple red for Nicole and signed with ther respective names. The  rods are Frontier 6.5ft rated for 8-15lb test line and should do well for walleye, bass and pike or anything else they may encounter short of musky and salmon.      "
