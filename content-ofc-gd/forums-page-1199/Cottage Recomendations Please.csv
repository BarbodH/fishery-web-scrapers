Manor Park Cottages is the name and we have exactly what your after. It's a nice little place with a clean, weed free beach and swim area. Clean cabins, nice docks and a good ramp. I'm told the fishen is good with pic's, pike and lots of bass. Prices are $750 and down. Send me a PM and I'll follow up with some pictures if your intereted.  Sorry for the spam but I was hopping for a spot to brag a little. We are all a little on edge and can't wait for the hard work to start. We've been looking for a place for a  few years and now that it's only a few days away it's hard to believe it's happening. Anyway thanks for the thread. I guess the next step is to buy some ad space on a great fishing site. lol.  KW Mike"
