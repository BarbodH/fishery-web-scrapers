82443,Roy,2007-06-11 18:01:00,13728,"I got a new smoker on the weekend and would like to know if any of you have a recipe (method) for smoking walleye. I tried some yesterday and while it's very tasty, it's not  quite what I'm looking for.  I did it with wine, lemons, parsley and cayenne pepper.  Thanks"
82452,misfish,2007-06-11 18:16:00,29133,This is where Rien/Rein is needed.
82454,Roy,2007-06-11 18:20:00,13728,"Yeah, Rein certainly knows his fish."
82456,Kirk,2007-06-11 18:21:00,347,"Soy sauce and brown sugar are key ingredients with mine, with walleye being so lean, keep the smoking time shorter to avoid drying out the meat, although drier has a longer shelf life.  I can email you the recipe, its at home, the standard big chief instructional recipe plus a few modifications.  (dill is a nice add on if you like the taste)"

82744,gussser,2007-06-12 10:50:00,85,Tried smokin Walleye once---couldn't roll them very well & they don't stay lit.
82762,aniceguy,2007-06-12 12:20:00,1094,"good liquid soak in 2 tbs of kosher salt, white wine, some molassas and brownsugar soak for 45 minutes then cold smoke ( if possible with apple chips) for 45 minutes.  ( Cold smoke is under 180 degrees) and off you go"
82765,ccmtcanada,2007-06-12 12:37:00,7971,I thought the thread was about this!!!  
83348,BryonG,2007-06-13 17:45:00,52,"In my humble opinion,walleye (because it has little oil or fat) does not lend itself to smoking.Trout,salmon,white bass,and my favorite carp take to the smoker more naturally.Walleye is my favorite eating fish by far,but there are farr better fish to smoke"
83393,Billy Bob,2007-06-13 20:00:00,5865,"Camp Chef is correct that walleye are not on the top of the list when it comes to smoking but I do smoke LARGE walleye that I catch from Lake Erie and did some just yesterday.  Here is a VERY easy fool proof recipe that I use for ALL different species of fish including the walleye and pike I did yesterday.  1/4 to 1/3 cup of KOSHER salt to about one gallon of water and 1 cup of brown sugar. Mix well and pour over your fish in a NON metal container. Seal with a lid ( I use a LARGE TupperWare container) and place in the fridge overnight. Just before smoking rinse off the fish (very slimy) and set on paper towels with the skin down. Try off the fish more by dabbing with more paper towels.  I use MAPLE wood for this smoke job, any Maple even Silver Maple will do very well. This works very well with any fish.  Good Smoking, Bob"
