82990,misfish,2007-06-12 21:42:00,29133,"Rob and I have been talking now for about 2+ months and I got the feeling this guy is a good person that has a great vision on fishing baits and supplies. Well today he we finally met in person and I must say TJ,you got yerself another great banner sponsor. His vision and expectations of his anglers is simple. Use the product and give your honest opinion on it. From what I had already recieved from my first shipment, I liked what I had seen and after today, and seeing the rest in person, I was totally blown away. The rods are of great quality and there are so many baits I didnt even get ,that I  could use.  We hit it off with a good chat and talked about what we both expect from each other. Im still new at this prostaff stuff and he made me feel very comfortable.  He was very generous once again with his donations with 3 new rods to try out,not just for bass. I got this great ice fish jigging rod that I cant wait to try out next winter. I feel very fortunate to have met this man and his company and Im sure he will have a great succesful carrier with his company.  For those that seen my post in the classifieds and then removed it was because it was in good bussiness,but after talking to Rob,I have been asked to put back the advert and pass on the savings to any member at any board I am a member to.  I am not a sales men I am just trying to help both sides, the supplier and the buyer.  Rob also donated shirts and hats and baits for the up coming Big Brothers and Sisters event.  I cant wait to get out there and give them green fish a taste of the Komanchi baits.  "
