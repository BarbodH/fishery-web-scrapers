83153,Mattitude,2007-06-13 05:27:00,155,"I was just checking this site out and saw this on all the lakes.  Is it pollen, if so that's crazy!  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/dat...io.143.250m.jpg"
83156,SlowPoke,2007-06-13 08:36:00,2984,"Pollen LOL! If you're refering to the white clumps scattered about, it's snow. The ice should be in any time now! Or, it might be clouds. -Brian"
83157,Rich Clemens,2007-06-13 08:50:00,3131,Nah ... it be clouds.  Cool satellite image.
83199,blaque,2007-06-13 12:14:00,2419,"DOnt think hes referring to the puffy clumps over land, Think he means the smoky looking areas on the lakes......and only on the lakes. If it were clouds they would continue on land......but they dont. Strange.....unless its a reflection of something overhead. BUt that doesnt make sense either. I dunno, i was just on the east end of Lake Erie a couple days ago and it had kind of a chalky green tinge to it. May just be the water clarity differential. But still , looks odd."
83200,mepps,2007-06-13 12:15:00,1301,"I'm inclined to think he is referring to the lake, not the land. Perhaps its discolouration from rain and sediment."
83206,Sinker,2007-06-13 12:30:00,8692,"I'd say it is indeed pollen on the water. Light winds this week, so its all over the lakes.  Sinker"
83208,pikehunter,2007-06-13 12:30:00,1659,"An algae bloom? Maybe, if this is a current picture then maybe not as I don't think blooms happen till later in the season. I don't think it's storm runoff as the murky water looks more in the middle of Lake O. Storm runoff is usually observed closer to shore."
83225,snag,2007-06-13 13:02:00,1932,Alien spores.  The white clumps are pods.  Don't go to sleep.
83239,BLACKFISH88,2007-06-13 13:41:00,191,I would have to say it's a mixture of smog and pollen especially with the high humidity we have been experiencing as of late. If you go to google earth and look at sat imagery of the lake near toronto it is unreal and it is no doubt that it is smog. So hop in your suv and take a drive.
83242,Tacklebuster,2007-06-13 13:45:00,303,I think its algae
83246,bigfish1965,2007-06-13 13:53:00,3382,I was out there the other day and the algae is pretty bad.
83249,Sinker,2007-06-13 14:03:00,8692,"I don't think all those lakes are having an algae bloom in the same week. I was on the kawartha's yesterday, and the surface was COVERED in pollen. I still think its pollen. Light winds all week will build it up and not mix it into the water.....it just floats on the surface.  Sinker"
83300,POLLIWOGG,2007-06-13 16:35:00,835,"Pollen. Check out the south shore of Prince Edward County, Thats all rock shoreline, see how bright green its become from the south winds."
83337,Mattitude,2007-06-13 17:23:00,155,"I'm thinking it's pollen only because it's everywhere this week.  It's all over my car like a fine yellowish dust and you can see it in the air as well.  That stuff on the lakes is on a few of the daily pictures so I don't think it's an anomoly in the picture.  I thought it was interesting, kind of gives a neat perspective of nature at work if that is what it is.  Thanks for the comments."
83340,bbog,2007-06-13 17:31:00,665,Pollen is my bet! All over the lake I was on last weekend and my car as well.
83342,Nanook,2007-06-13 17:32:00,565," Definately Pollen, dont know where from, but its the worst I can remember.It's covering the lakes, cars, my White window trims are Yellow.Tired of cleaning it off.....hope it rains soon LOL"
83352,ccmtcanada,2007-06-13 17:53:00,7971,I was fishing the shores of Lake Ontario last night.  I shone the flashlight after it was dark and the amount of pollen in the air was unbelievable!  It was almost like it was snowing out there.  There was a yellow film on the water where we were fishing.  I guess I know why my allergies have been acting up in the past 3 or 4 days.
