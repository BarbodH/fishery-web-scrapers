It was great over the weekend and slow today. Got two Chinooks but had to work really hard for them. Both under 10 Lbs. Tried the cut meat for 4 hours  - not a touch.... Same goes for the flies. The only (relative) luck I had was on Spoons on the riggers - 20-30 down in 120 fow. Purple and watermelon. Did run all over from 80 to 230 fow....back and forth...and back again.....just those two. Was a nice day and got out before getting really hot. No pictures today - forgot the cell phone home.  Hope next time I get the timing right ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
