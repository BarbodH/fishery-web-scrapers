83169,Marc Thorpe,2007-06-13 10:20:00,621,Looks like you had yourself a wonderfull day Lew Very nice photo of your nephew Cool pics of the Eagle
82262,lew,2007-06-11 11:15:00,12767,"I've heard of some Bald Eagles being sighted in the Kawarthas in the last couple years but haven't been fortunate enough to spot any myself.....until a couple days ago.  I spotted the bird sitting on top of a dead tree but just figured it was an Osprey, until I got close enough for a decent look.....absolutely gorgeous and majestic birds !!!!!  The female was in another tree about 100 yards away.  Unfortunately I couldn't get close enough for a close-up shot and my camera's only a 3-X Optic zoom but he shows up pretty good nontheless.  I shoulda had DanC along with his photo skills  Sitting on the tree    Just after I took this picture he dropped down to the water and grabbed a fish.    She's hard to spot, but you can see the female  sitting on a branch, just slightly below, and to the right of center.    I had my nephew in the boat....Eddyk's son....and he was able to land his 1st ever musky too. It was only a tiny fish but the 1st one is always very memorable and he was more than happy with it.  All in all, a great day !!  "
82263,Roy,2007-06-11 11:21:00,13728,A great day for both of you Lew and I'm sure that there was a third occupant in your boat.
82266,solopaddler,2007-06-11 11:25:00,8605,"That's great to see. Both the eagle and you getting out with your nephew...  cheers,  Mike"
82267,Jer,2007-06-11 11:33:00,1426,"Funny you mention the eagle, Lew.  Just yesterday, my neighbour and his wife were out for a boat ride in the afternoon and said they had seen an eagle on it's nest among the islands across the lake. I nodded and said how neat (and then whispered to my buddy next to me ""osprey"").  Where did ya spot the bird? Was it on Buckhorn near the passage thru the islands?  The number of ospreys around lately is astounding...it would be great to see a few pairs of old baldy around as well."
82269,fishdawg,2007-06-11 11:48:00,912,I remember seeing those osprey in that nest Jer - last time was about 4 yrs ago
82273,Guest mistyriver1,2007-06-11 11:58:00,0,"Eagles are my favorite birds.  That is awesome that they are starting to turn up.  Congrats to your nephew Lew, great report.  Jim"

82283,nofrills,2007-06-11 12:21:00,89,I hear theres 1 or 2 mating pairs of bald eagles living along the Otanobee river. Something I'd like to see in person!
82291,jediangler,2007-06-11 12:43:00,1923,"Great pics Lew. There's nothing like getting someone into their first musky, well done."
82299,musky66,2007-06-11 13:07:00,273,"Damn birds- soon Osprey and Bald Eagles will be a nuisance like the Cormorant! LOL, I was riding my sled on Cook Bay this winter and am positive I saw an Eagle flying- it was way to big for a Hawk! Way cool"
82300,b2kptbo,2007-06-11 13:08:00,1505,"Good going Lew, thanks for the pic's..."
82317,Randy,2007-06-11 13:51:00,115,"Lew, a couple of years ago I reported seeing a bald eagle's nest on Upper Buckhorn. Last year when I returned, there was a couple of young'uns in the nest.  So they can be spreading to other lakes in the Kawartha's."
82322,RobHall,2007-06-11 13:58:00,261,"Excellent Report!!  Congrats to your nephew!!     Thanks for sharing.  I'm sure it feels great to get your nephew into his first ski.  Too bad you weren't as lucky.  I'm sure your first ski of the year, will be boated soon.  FOTB "

83054,Jigatollah,2007-06-13 00:17:00,53,I've seen that pair of bald eagles in the same lake Lew. They were a bit south of that lake during the late winter. Watched them chase the ducks on the exposed water as the ice was melting this spring. Good to see they are coming back.
