83067,crappiesteve,2007-06-13 00:27:00,220,Yes you ARE Tom  Steve
83069,motv8tr,2007-06-13 00:31:00,2587,"You guys don't need any tips, just put a hook in the water and the fish will come  See you soon Maureen"

83219,Mike the Pike,2007-06-13 12:53:00,3421,Cliff here are some of the lures that have all caught pike now don't go out and buy them all or you won't have beer and gas money for Lakair.  The hottest lure in my Box right now the pink Rapala X-rap the pike inhaled that in Quinte.  The red devil and silver and gold Mepps have always produced when fishing gets tough.  Good luck I hope you catch a PB.MTP      
83224,Headhunter,2007-06-13 13:02:00,5703,"The up side of the chalk outline, is that you can always sweep it up and gulp it down, to try and control some of that nasty after beverage heart burn! HH"
82886,ccmtcanada,2007-06-12 17:20:00,7971,"Bly and I will be up at Lakair in 10 days!!!  This will be the furthest north we've fished...actually, anywhere north of Lake Scugog fits this bill!! LOL.  We want to be prepared for when we fish with Nipissing on Saturday for the Pike Tourney.  We have some things, but just wondering what the experts out there think....  We have:  A few Husky Jerks Assorted Crank Baits A few Spinnerbaits A bunch of plastics Leaders  Any other suggestions...or colours choices?  Thanks....cant wait to get up there!!!!!  PS.  I was going to get put this on the pinned Lakair thread, but didn't want to hijack it...there's some hilarious stuff in there!!!"
82889,Roy,2007-06-12 17:26:00,13728,"Cliff and Carole, the pike there (or anywhere else for that matter) hit anything that moves. You seem to have a good enough assortment to pull off a win at the tourney. See you up there."
82891,AzuluSpookd,2007-06-12 17:29:00,348,Hey Cliff....  One of my favourites for late morning until mid afternoon........  as soon as the sun spits out of the clouds.....throw on.....  a GOLD Williams Spoon.....  always a sure bet
82895,Gerritt,2007-06-12 17:35:00,6129,"Cliff, Black and Silver #12 HJ. All you need.  Gerritt."
82899,Terry,2007-06-12 17:46:00,14456,"I have never been able to go to the Lakair G2G   but from what I hear....no one really goes fishing  it's one long party...the last one standing Saturday night wins the p.i.k.e. tourney   p.i.k.e...stands for Pukes In Kitchen Everywhere, or something like that     well that's what I hear.......not many will talk cause what happens  at Lakair..stays at Lakair    hope that helps....LOL"
82903,Nanook,2007-06-12 17:49:00,565,
82909,RobHall,2007-06-12 18:04:00,261,"Cliff,  For whatever it's worth.  I've hooked into many pike and my PB ski on this rapala original floating minnow #13.  Not far from Lakeair heading north toward the elbow and Muskie Island.    GL  FOTB "
82915,Spiel,2007-06-12 18:10:00,9065,".....For me can't beat a Mepps zero (gotta be gold) tethered to 4lb test but I really shouldn't be telling you this. Oh and one other thing, leave the leaders at home."
82918,blaque,2007-06-12 18:15:00,2419,"To back up Gerritt's suggestion .............Saw guys at the camp a couple weeks back in South Bay come back with lots of Pike, and some BIG fish at that......all caught on a #14 Silver and Black Husky Jerk. Im not one to pick out a special color or lure and say it was the be all end all of baits for a certain species or lake. Just relaying what the guys told me was ""the lure"" for them. I didnt do much pike fishin.......but when i did, i caught a bunch of hammerhandles on smaller husky jerks and floating rapalas. Again......i dont think color, or presentation mattered much as they attacked lots of colors sizes and retrieves."
82919,tipupesox,2007-06-12 18:16:00,167,I myself am a fan of the Mepps Black Fury for the snot rockets up in the West Arm/bay area.  I have made a spinnerbait in the same color pattern and it works fantastic.  Tom
82920,ccmtcanada,2007-06-12 18:17:00,7971,Wow...great suggestions guys....now....gotta think here....who's going to lakair and is maybe trying to sabotage me....LOL.
82921,Spiel,2007-06-12 18:19:00,9065,
82927,Roy,2007-06-12 18:30:00,13728,"Cliff, if you can lock on to an area holding pike, what you throw is irrelevant. That's a fact. There won't be too many in the actual tourney this year anyway. Most of the crew will be at Art's cottage watching the authorities draw chalk outlines.  :-)"
82930,Spiel,2007-06-12 18:33:00,9065,"  ....HaHaHaHa, ain't it the truth....LOL"
82932,Kev,2007-06-12 18:38:00,54,You can never go wrong with a red/white daredevil spoon or a 5 diamond yellow/red spoon. (plus they're usually cheaper than alot of other lures)

82935,aplumma,2007-06-12 18:52:00,6896,  Just as long as we all stick together and have the same story we might get away with it.   Art
82940,Joey,2007-06-12 19:09:00,9122,   Keep an eye out for Avery and his Jumla lures for sure  Joey
82950,Golfisher,2007-06-12 19:31:00,586,"I learned my lesson after my trip to Shining Tree a few weeks ago.  When fish bite, they dont' care what you are throwing at them; when they don't, well, let's just say that I sunk in hundreds of dollars into new lures, and all that they got on the last week of May, 2007, is a good bath in the cold, clear waters of the West Shining Tree Lake.  But, be that as it may, X-Raps have always been my favourite lure to wash, and occasionally catch a pike or two, here and there, but not at Shining Tree.  Dang."
82958,spanky,2007-06-12 20:04:00,195,if i had a boat and the wife some vacation time.. i tell ya'... i'd haul the wife up there for a couple days... never been and sounds like alot of fun!!
82962,Rich Clemens,2007-06-12 20:34:00,3131,"Probably my best pike were caught on spinnernaits (about 1 oz or so) with a 5-6 inch twister tail as a little extra incentive.  Last year, on the French, I caught a very respectable pike on a shallow invader - also raised a couple muskies with it as well.   I'll have these baits with me at Lakair as well.  Great post ... I don't think I have enough in my wallet for this Lakiair thing to buy a pack of hooks.  Only 5 more sleeps ... this must be what a little kid feels like waiting for Santa Clause."
82963,John,2007-06-12 20:38:00,2956,"Hey Cliff, look forward to seeing you two up there. As everyone has already said, when they are on you can pretty much throw anything. Two years ago I was catching 12"" 'er after 12"" 'er on Super Shad Raps and a buddy hooked into a 40"" 'er on a tiny spinnerbait 4' from the boat.  You are fine with what you have and if not come and raid my tackle box anytime...  John"
83004,Daplumma,2007-06-12 22:11:00,1961,"Now thats funny,I dont care who you are!Hope Tom doesn't see this thread. Joe"
83035,Muskieman,2007-06-12 23:46:00,2472,"when are ya gonna be here? i fished Lakair on this past sunday and did very good ,, GO BIG OR GO HOME!! . they were hitting   3/4 os --1 /oz spinnerbaits, light colored with a red/white colorado blade, add a singer hook and a 4"" gulp twister tail for good measure. i also did good with a williams wabler with an added weedless triple hook. it's a light spoon for it's size it can stay above the weeds. if you' re gonna use any body bait remove the front hook cause there are alot of weeds.  p.s the water is very stained after 13 days of rain and pollen.. so use a louder bait try to cast spoons high up so they hit the water with a slap.  Muskieman  Good Luck !"
83038,fishindevil,2007-06-12 23:51:00,6254,"My tried and true pike weapon is.....a BLADE DANCER...... they are wicked made by berkley and they just cant resist them,cliff you guys got what you need except one of those trust me please go get a few......you will thank me for it.....take care"
