82823,Maida_gc,2007-06-12 15:32:00,5,"Well hello. What an awesome & active forum... I see a few people at work today browsing around.  I'm 27, been getting into the sport a lot more the past few years and starting next year (curtousey of a New house North of Whitby coming soon) will be heading to either Lake Scugog or Rice lake more often as they are fairly close by. I mainly fish bass right now, but would like to add to my portfolio the next few years.  For now, I head to the Cottage in Presqui'le on Brighton Bay for the odd weekend and get some fishing in. Brighton Bay the past few years has become much better fishing as the fish have finally made the swim down the Canal from the Bay of Quinte (a great fishing location), and for the guy who asked about Brighton Bay, the safest bet to entertain the Grand Kids would be the mouth of the Canal (Both small & large mouth & rock bass).  Anyway, wanted to say hello, and say thanks for providing me one more place to visit to put off actually working.  I also had a question regarding the opening of Bass Season for Brighton Bay, I'm planning on going Saturday June 30th, but assumed that was opening weekend? Am I off a week? Thanks gang."

82902,snoil,2007-06-12 17:49:00,139,Typically it is the last Saturday in June but being it's the long weekend i beleive that's why it's been moved up a week.
