82956,Jen,2007-06-12 19:59:00,833,"Thanks everyone... I am still thinking of all the beautiful places I forgot to or missed taking pictures of.  Recently someone said to me.  You see beauty around you everyday, it is only when you catch it with the lens of your camera that you become aware of it.  That comment is so true!  Now onto the next adventure...  Cheers,  Jen"
82465,Jen,2007-06-11 18:45:00,833,"The weekend started Thursday night at midnight... I can never sleep the night before fishing, so I figured I would do the drive while it was dark. This way I could watch the sun rise at the lake while waiting on the world to wake up. Although as you can tell by the picture I didn't get there by sunrise.    This was my first time in Tamagami... and wow, I now understand why ppl will drive for hours to spend time there.  Arrive at the camp      With just enough time to grab a 2 hour nap before everyone else arrives and we head out on the lake for a tour and a little walk through the bush.    Moose tracks    After a little tumble, yes I fell on my hike. I decided it was time to go back to the boat.  I hadn't really considered the ramifications of wandering through Tamagami wilderness without anything but your camera till after I was sitting fishing for a while...What if I did see a moose or a bear for that matter?  I pondered on that for a short time.  A couple of hours of checking out the lake, trolling, jigging, casting and just unwinding,  one fish caught and a huge storm blows in.  Thankfully there was an unused boathouse just around the other side of the island...    And of course I still had to fish while waiting out the rain and high winds... one rock bass added to the list of catches...    Storm blew over within an hour.  My first Tamagami Sunset    The next morning , up not so bright and early... off to another lake North of Tamagami.  Rapids along the way      Heading out for a day of fishing which will include a shore lunch.      Guess who forgot the stringer at home?    Perfect place for a shore lunch!    Everyone Arrives!    Island resident and her babies    My first ever shore lunch...mmm was it ever good.      Fully Tummies, back to fishing   .   Then this beaver shows up, having a real fit ... coming up practically to the boat before slapping his tail on the water and diving.   The entertainment he provided lasted atleast 30 minutes.       Last pike Saturday being released    As night approached several pickeral were caught...although my numbers when it came to how many I got in the boat in comparison to how many I lost were not looking good.   Heading back to camp after 10 hours on the water.    Minus the pike that got eatten at lunch, this was the catch for the day!    Sunday morning!  I had planned on heading out on the water by 5 am... although it was more like 10.  Off to a new lake, and they said the boat launch was decent... hmmm nope    It wasn't a moose or a bear, but it was alive.      Muskie fishing wasn't happening, even though I did try a lure... which happens to be the only lure I did not come home with this weekend    Three days in wonderland are now over.  Even though it was extreamly hot and sunny on Sunday, I just did not want to pack up and head home.  The sun set on the way home.    A special THANK YOU to Bob, Bill, Marilyn and everyone else I met on the weekend.  You guys are amazing! From the food, fishing, laughter and fun friendships are made.  It truly was a weekend spent learning new things, enjoying the company of great people and seeing the world in a different light!  Cheers, Jen"
