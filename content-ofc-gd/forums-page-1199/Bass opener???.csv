82612,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-11 23:07:00,4399,"Judging by the number of guys in bass boats I saw on Scugog this weekend pitching and flipping the weeds I almost thought bass season was open, apparenlty the regs are ignored by many!"
82613,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-11 23:09:00,4399, Fishingguy you could always get to Simcoe early and get the good spot before the blast off! LOL

82632,bbog,2007-06-11 23:55:00,665,"Hi fishingguy28,  I do most of my fishing from a canoe (except when trolling deep for big fish) and was thinking a smaller back lake as well. I have my favorite lake just south of Parry Sound - but I think I'm going to try something different (and away from the crowds) for the opener. I'll post my results.  Barn"

82803,charlesn,2007-06-12 14:28:00,551,The Big Brother Big Sister Catch a Dream event is on opening day in Orillia.  A very rewarding experience to take a Big and Little out on the lake for what may be their one and only trip of the season.  There's a BBQ after and sure to be lots and lots of smiling little faces.  That's where I'll be.  Charles
