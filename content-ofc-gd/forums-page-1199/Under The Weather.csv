83066,Bob,2007-06-13 00:24:00,370,"I've been a sick puppy for a while, doing battle with bronchitis and some kind of virus with it.  Kept me flat on my back for weeks but I'm feeling much better now. This afternoon, Peg lit a fire under me and said, ""You have to get out and do something."" so what better than to trip down to the local dock and throw a line in. Started tossing a husky jerk and 4th cast, hit a pike.  Few more casts and another one.  I missed 2 more after that and we called it quits, man, it was hot out there.  Work up a sweat just drawing breath.  Nice to be out though.  Pike were just snot rockets but big enough for a meal for two and they were nice on the barbecue.  Didn't bother taking pix, no bragging stuff there."
83073,motv8tr,2007-06-13 00:36:00,2587,"Sorry to hear you were under the weather Bob, glad you're up and about now.  Nothing like a good sweat to clean out what ail's ya  .  Maureen"
83079,Carp,2007-06-13 00:49:00,1488,Being sick really bites. Glad to hear you still managed to get out and catch a few.
83088,OhioFisherman,2007-06-13 01:03:00,6623,"Go easy Bob! my first diagnosis was broncitis, LOL and it went to heck after that!"
83143,pameladallaire,2007-06-13 03:36:00,470,"I'll hold off on the diagnosis/prognosis.  See your doctor if you are having trouble breathing, I know how you feel.  They are still coming up with more reasons for my breathing difficulties, they just called today to tell me my blood work is out of whack.  Back to the doctors.  Pam"
83146,SBCregal,2007-06-13 03:57:00,688,"Sorry to hear Bob, Glad you're doin better! Tell Aunt Peg I say hi  Ryan"
83222,Headhunter,2007-06-13 12:59:00,5703,Take 'er easy Bob and get well soon! HH
83232,Joey,2007-06-13 13:20:00,9122,I'm glad you're coming around Bob.  I've had bronchitis many times and it does pack a wollop.  Hope you feel better soon.  Joey
