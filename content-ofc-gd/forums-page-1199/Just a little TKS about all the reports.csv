83049,Marc Thorpe,2007-06-13 00:12:00,621," At least I were a shirt  when I do it  Depends who's rear I smooch   Its been a good wet sock year once again,caught some King Kongs getting ready to wrap up one last shoot on thursday then Muskies ""Fish with attitude""  The opening wet sock season was good with lots of "" Mud Puppies"" (Sauger)being caught. At times the bite was ridiculous,on the water at 7 and off by 1-2 pm,then kinna relax and do it all over again.Pike bite was pretty good,we had 24 pike in 19 minutes with triples and quadruples  Then my fun time started,short linning wet socks (walleyes)  and yaking King Kongs,although the top end did not reach last years high the overall size was really good with 20 something fish in the 6 to 9 pound range.The beauty of it all was looking guest in the face and telling em ,its gotta go back Once the emotional scaring healed they were fine with it  Spent a wonderfull evening with Roy one night and Few hours with Darsky and enjoyed the time Also got to fish a couple of evenings with my cousin and niece and my dad So overall was a good spring with smiles on shore  Some people cant wait to get to bed after work I cant wait to get up"
