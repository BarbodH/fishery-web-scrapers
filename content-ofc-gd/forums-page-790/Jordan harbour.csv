Probably need another bushel yet with all the salsa we make. The reward was a quick trip down the road to the harbour before dark. No problem finding the bass. They were hitting spinnerbaits, tubes and 6"" twisters. Most were dinks.   one decent bass.  Spent a little time looking for perch, but they hadn't moved in yet. Only caught a couple.  Great way to blow 2 hours."

Funny, I was thinking about hitting there a couple days ago, looks like I'll definitely be checking it out now.  Hey Bigugli, next time yer down there, bring an extra jar of salsa, just in case I run into you.   And if I'm not asking too much, spaghetti sauce too."
381184,Mike Pike,2009-09-09 12:45:00,1332,"Good fishin' as usual Bigugli.  And a nice haul of tomatoes.  I always say. if someone hasn't eaten a freshly picked tomatoe, they've never tasted a tomato!  Isn't it funny how the ones at the grocery store are bland and tastless comparitively.  Anyhoo, hope to run into ya one of these days down in the Pennisula!"
381195,bigugli,2009-09-09 13:04:00,6138,We all have a choice. The tomato ripened in the truck    or the one ripened on the vine  We must have sold well over 1000lb at the market Saturday and another 200lb+ of fancy cherry toms. The stuff I was packing was what was left from the last 2 weeks picks and too ripe for market now. I've got no more room in the freezer til I boil some down
381202,Mike Pike,2009-09-09 13:23:00,1332,"Hey, what market do ya sell at?  It wouldn't be Ottawa Street in Hamilton would it?  I go to that one all the time."
