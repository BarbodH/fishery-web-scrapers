380729,scuro2,2009-09-08 03:17:00,904," I spend a week with my mom each summer. This summer I convinced her that we should see something new, no matter how nice Mary lake is by Huntsville.   My mom has an eye for beautiful things.   My daughter Sara came along and we both appreciated it. 3000 k's gives you lots of time to talk.   The furtherest west we stayed was Rossport.   And on a day trip we got just outside of Nipigon to a lookout that I had been to 3 years ago. I've travelled all of the major highways of Ontario, except west of Thunderbay. Some other time.   We saw a lot.   I'd like very much to return to this area and stay for a week or two in a few choice areas.   This area has a way of soothing your soul.   Of course I did some fishing in the mornings.   Pike were easy. They hammered rainbow spoons.   Harder was fishing river mouths. Simply because there was a mouth, didn't mean there were desirable fish. I did hook into a silvery white bodied fish near here. Dark blue and green on the top. I would have flung it up on the shore but I would have killed it, as we were not making our own meals at this location. This fish was not dogged, but athletic and spirited. I hooked the same fish, or same type of fish several times over two mornings, all looking to be around 5 pounds. Only ever brought it close enough to shore to keep once. Anyone have any idea what sort of fish that could be? Caught it on a cleo. No other fish were biting at the mouths. Lots of fun in a beautiful location."

380769,anders,2009-09-08 13:08:00,1168,"Scuro...very nice pics!  Did you throw any spoons in at old woman bay??  the coho's start hitting them right about now.  The last pic looks like the mouth of the Michipicoten?  Correct or no?  If it was at the mich...most likely a chinook...no real run of the ho's yet, but an abundance of Chinooks in the 4-8lb range"
380780,BillM,2009-09-08 13:28:00,17367,I would assume that silvery fish was either a coho or a steelie.  Maybe even a whitie?
380874,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-08 19:09:00,0,the green makes me think coho...
380920,Dano,2009-09-08 20:43:00,719,"Nice pics, looks like a beautiful trip. Thanks for sharing."
381029,Carp,2009-09-09 01:19:00,1488,Chinooks that close to shore would be getting dark this time of year. I agree it was probably cohos or bows.
381051,NAW,2009-09-09 01:31:00,4022,Thanks for the report.  Nice pics of your journeys.

381150,scuro2,2009-09-09 04:24:00,904,"A humpie? When I saw them in BC they didn't have that white silver look to them.   Looking at this pic from the net, I'd guess coho. That blue green top is what I saw. These fish were totally fresh, very lively, and jittery. The chinooks I've tangled with have all been dogged."
