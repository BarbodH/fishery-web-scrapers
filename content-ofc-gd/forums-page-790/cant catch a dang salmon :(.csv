381478,[emailÂ protected],2009-09-09 22:45:00,2,i live in barrie but i was visiting sault st marie and i pulled in a 19 pounder off the shore of garden river . do u know where echo bay is?
381491,redneck666,2009-09-09 23:03:00,563,yessir
377480,redneck666,2009-08-28 19:19:00,563,"hey folks, heres my story:   I went fishing a couple days in a row including last night. i watched a few people bring in some nice salmon (one was brought in on a spoon of some sort and i dont know the rest). one guy brought in a very nice walleye on a rapala (he was hoggin all the fish! lol).  anyhow i was just wondering whats working for you shore fisherman in sault ste. marie on the st. mary's river, for 'eyes and salmon? i had my cell on me too, shoulda took a pic of that beautiful walleye.  i've also tried a 2/5oz little cleo, a spawn sac with a hildabrant spinner, plain spawn sack and hook, glow in the dark and pink/white twister tails.   JP"
377481,BillM,2009-08-28 19:24:00,17367,You should have no problems chucking spoons or even using giant skein chunks down there.  That place is full of fish.
377483,redneck666,2009-08-28 19:27:00,563,"lol well, what kind of spoons?....... and what the heck are skein chunks and how do you fish with them and rig them? (i think some guy yesterday was usin it? and got a nice salmon)"
377492,danbo,2009-08-28 20:11:00,2646,1/3 oz Lil' Cleo...Silver/Chartruese for daylight..Glow-in-the-Dark for nights. Use a flashlight to charge it up!
377493,Hooked,2009-08-28 20:15:00,891,"Try throwing some jointed Rebel Fastracs in 5 of diamonds or some J-11's or 13's in orange or fire-tiger, or blue, they all work.  They catch anything that swims."
377497,redneck666,2009-08-28 20:27:00,563,"  lol, i've never heard of any of that tackle...... explain?"
377499,Marko,2009-08-28 20:31:00,854,"Open the the link and first 3 are commonly used off piers http://www.fishusa.com/ACME-Little-Cleo-Spoons_p.html GLB, GLF and GLG, just need a flashlight to get them glowing. As of roe skien i am sure its used with the float set up."
377507,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-28 20:59:00,0,"with the salmon i'd recommend a combo of heavy cleos and buzzbombs for shore fishing...it's not the strong year for the pink salmon (they run stronger every 2nd year)...that's a shame because pinks are a little easier to catch than chinooks from shore...  you could also try some larger sized rapalas/bombers...  i spent a lot of time fishing walleye downtown...  the key is finding the current breaks near points and backeddy's...  suspending crankbaits like the husky jerk and x rap work very well...especially in clown, ghost colours....  do this after dark as in the evenings they come so shallow they are almost right at your feet sometimes.  there are TONS of walleye downtown... when i used to go down there all the time 10-15 fish evenings were not uncommon."
377508,redneck666,2009-08-28 21:11:00,563,"  wow, lol thank god for guys like you!  i havent had the greatest fishing season since ice-out, i always seem to embarras myself in one way another when im out haha.   thanks for the info. guys!   JP"
377510,redneck666,2009-08-28 21:13:00,563,"hey, Dr. Salvelinus, is skein another word for roe? if so how would i fish with it from shore from downtown?"
377513,Kinger,2009-08-28 21:15:00,351,I've caught 17 walleye in the last 4 sessions this week from shore downtown.
377518,redneck666,2009-08-28 21:26:00,563,"oh nice!..... with what?.... rapala?    you think a shad rap rs in perch would work good?.... it dives a little deep though, im a little concerned about snags.... oh well if you wanna play you gotta pay!"
377522,Kinger,2009-08-28 22:01:00,351,As mentioned before the hot patterns are glass and clown. A recent favorite is Blue with white belly and orange under the lip. They will hit jigs n' rubber when the crankbait bite is off.
377528,Cudz,2009-08-28 22:29:00,2652,"Salmon.  Marshmallow big hook.  Feel something and reel like snot. If that doesn't work try a big weighted trebble hook.  You don't even need bait for this one.  lol! On a more serious note. I usually throw cleos. If you want to change it up and be different, try this.  chrome and blue rattlin spot or rattlin rap.  I know it sounds weird but I have caught several using them.  I think the noise of the rattles bothers them."
377532,Twocoda,2009-08-28 22:47:00,4130,all i have to say is ....ITS DOESENT MATTER WHAT YOU PRESENT .....MAKE SURE YOU PRESENT IT PROPERLY ....then and only then ....you will find the difference between catching fish ....and taking pics of other peoples phish....  presentation ....presentation ...presentation ....need i say more about presentation????
377537,redneck666,2009-08-28 22:55:00,563,  lol! well ive snagged them in the rapids before with a big spoon.... almost got caught so needless to say i fish for them properly now. and i've heard about the marshmellow thing for steelhead but does it really work for salmon?  and im gunna try  a spawn sac with a slip sinker and see if that works.    JP

377563,Cudz,2009-08-29 00:57:00,2652,"Yes people do it for salmon as well, but don't do it.  It is dirty indeed."
377571,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-29 01:22:00,0,do you have a vehicle and are you willing to drive an hour or so to catch a salmon?
377574,redneck666,2009-08-29 01:26:00,563,well... im 16..... and the furthest i'll be goin in the next few days before september is st. joe's island for 'eyes.

377580,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-29 02:04:00,0,garden river and bridgland ck.
377594,redneck666,2009-08-29 02:23:00,563,"my dads bud from work is supposed to be out at garden right now, and wheres bridgland ck?"
