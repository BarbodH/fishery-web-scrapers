379891,Uncle Buck,2009-09-04 18:05:00,1000,I'm blowing Fuses on My trailer lights?  I unhook the wiring harness before i back the boat in  i've blown them 3X only one of them... Left Tail i believe  any ideas?
379893,Roy,2009-09-04 18:11:00,13728,"I'd replace the whole unit, Goran. The socket and connections are probably bad. They're not expensive."
379898,bubbles,2009-09-04 18:31:00,591,"Yep  Short somewhere, hardly worth looking for it, just replace."
379906,Uncle Buck,2009-09-04 18:46:00,1000,we're talking about my plug on the vehicle correct?
379910,Terry,2009-09-04 18:55:00,14456,no if the short was on the plug on the vehicle it would blow a fuse when the trailer is not hooked up most likely...very small chance  but it is a short some where  you can spend a heck of a long time finding it but if you think it's left follow the yellow wire and the left light but replacing everything is faster
379911,Roy,2009-09-04 19:02:00,13728,Replace the left tail light assembly Goran.
380046,moparhawk,2009-09-05 01:40:00,146,"Fought that battle for a long time, could find no nicks in the wires nothing. Finally unhooked my side marker lights, replaced the fuse and bingo no blown fuse ever since. Quick fix but worth a try"
380114,Greencoachdog,2009-09-05 11:36:00,8163,"I'd replace both rear assemblies, like mentioned earlier... they're not that expensive. I't doesn't take that long to do either. I replaced my old ones last year with the new sexy LED's!!!"
380117,Roy,2009-09-05 11:45:00,13728,"Yeah, the Dawg is right. The right assembly is the same age as the left one so it's just a matter of time."
380159,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 14:44:00,3382,Yeah and might as well go the LED route while you are doing it.
380376,smally21,2009-09-06 23:48:00,993,"blowing fuses in my experience is almost always pinched wires.  check the wires where they enter and leave the trailer and around the mounting points (screws, rivets) to make sure nothing is pinched or grounding to the frame  - this is assuming they did work before. if not you may have wired in a short.  leaving your lights plugged in does not blow fuses, not sure where this idea comes from.  always quicker to replace than trouble shoot, but could be something simple!"
380382,Greencoachdog,2009-09-07 00:14:00,8163,"  That's right!... if you have the proper submersible sealed unit tail lights, you don't have to unplug before launching!  I think some folks may ""cheap out"" and just buy the regular unsealed trailer lights... and that's where the ""unplug"" comes from!"
380395,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-07 01:12:00,2038,     It should be illegal to sell those cheapy tail lights...
380412,Fang,2009-09-07 02:26:00,1330,Goran  if you're gonna replace buy LED. Princess auto has deals almost monthly on LED submersibles. Ever since I replaced mine never had any problems. Oh and buy the way I'd say you've got a grounding problem somewhere. They're like needles in haystacks
380415,Greencoachdog,2009-09-07 02:32:00,8163,  Ha!!! what do you know?... you can't even tell the difference between a Groundhog and a Woodchuck!
380451,Jer,2009-09-07 12:25:00,1426,"...how much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck would chuck wood..."
381424,boatman,2009-09-09 21:08:00,350,"Hey Goran,  Since its only blowing when the light gets wet it is likely due to a bad seal on the light bezel. The wiring is probably fine. Unplugging the lights is fine, but the problem is that the bezel fills with water and doesn't completely drain before you plug the lights back in. It may not blow immediately. Sometimes, water sits at a level below the blub and doesn't short out the socket until you turn a corner or hit a bump etc.  I'd replace both bezels as mentioned. Solder the new connections and use waterproof shrink tubing on the wires. Actually, I'd replace the whole thing from the 4 wire plug on back."
381427,Terry,2009-09-09 21:13:00,14456,where did he say it happens when the light is wet
381430,boatman,2009-09-09 21:18:00,350,"Sorry, my mistake. I just re-read the post. It doesn't say it happens when wet just that he unplugs before getting them wet. Ignore some of what I said."
