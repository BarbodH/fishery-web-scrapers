381433,TJQ,2009-09-09 21:22:00,7806,"I was going over the hill!!  LOL..  Monique and I headed up for what turned out to be an incredible long weekend.  Left the kids at home and although it was in August we celebrated our 20th anniversary.  I couldn't imagine a better p[lace to do it.  The weather was fantastic and the nights were so bright we took our first ever midnight run up the river.  I even caught a decent pike on topwater at 11pm.  Here's some pics from the weekend.   We also used a pink lucky strike lure from http://www.highlightsforhope.ca/ a project a good friend of ours is working on (plug - plug)  it was pretty hot all weekend even up north, I installed an umbrella in the boat to stop my lard from melting into butter...  lol.  and there were mosquitoes.. which is odd for this time of year.  The beavers were hard at work all weekend, and we saw our first otter on the river.  I did a little bit of work, I put in a new built to spec - custom bush electrical panel for the multitudes of stuff we run/charge/watch and listen too, and put the splitter to work for the afternoon as well. I love that thing.   We even managed a feed of pickeral, small, but super tasty.  We're catching small ones in 40 feet of water.. and I still can't find the larger ones.. but I'll keep looking.  That it till next time.  (Partridge opens soon so watch out...  Monique also got an antlerless deer tag for our area, this is the first year they even have a season in our WMU)                          "
