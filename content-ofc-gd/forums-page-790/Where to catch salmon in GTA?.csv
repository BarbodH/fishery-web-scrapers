381185,Victor,2009-09-09 12:46:00,1609,"I would try trolling in Sobeys/Metro or even Loblaws ...  On a serious note ... check out MNR's ""Urban Fishing Opportunities"" document ... in there it lists a bunch of spots where you can catch whatever fish. At this time of the year, find river mouths or lower stretches of those rivers.  Remember to let us know how you make out."
