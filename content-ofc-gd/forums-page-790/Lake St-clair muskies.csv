380417,Greencoachdog,2009-09-07 02:43:00,8163,"Let's face it, guided trips count for little next to nothing!!!... all you're doing is reeling in the guides fish for him!!!  Guides are prima donnas, they won't reel in fish, they won't clean weeds off the hook... all they wanna do is drive the dang boat!!!... HELL!, I can do THAT!!!!  If it was me, I'd ask they pay me 100$ to take the trip!!!"

380456,fishingisliving,2009-09-07 12:57:00,170,"LOL  guiding = babysitting  Guide: have you fished before? baby: yes! I am pretty good at it... Guide: alright, take this baitcaster, tie on this lure and go stand at the front. baby: how does this snap work? Guide: here, bring it over, SNAP, done ok now go at the front. baby: ok Guide: see the weed bed, throw the bait 5 feet off it to the right, as we work down weed line, and reel in as fast as you can. baby: ok * baby winds back (sideways) fires the bait in the air, half way through it goes pop, lure comes crashing down in the water* baby: what happened? Guide: backlash, give me the rod, quick. Guide: there! now try it again, keep your thumb on the spool this time *baby winds the rod back again swings the lure in the air.. * Guide: easy, keep off the weed b... *lure lands right in the weed bed*  Guide: ok let's go trolling  * FISH ON!*  Guide: pick up the rod Baby: ok ... ...

380901,scugpg,2009-09-08 19:53:00,1373,I had the opportunity to fish with Bob in the spring on the DR. He's a great guide had a blast. Love the Ranger boats as well
381148,Bob Devine,2009-09-09 04:17:00,251,"Musky fishing has been good this yr. In 2006 VHS hit the musky population hard but like always mother nature came back. We are seeing a lot of small fish 24""-30"" and the ones that beat the virus are big, healthy and have an attitude(similiar to GCD) but muskies have teeth. LOL This trip could be casting, jigging or trolling. I will let the winners know what is best at that time. "
