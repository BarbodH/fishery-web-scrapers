To connect the frame together I want to use pre-fab’d metal brackets.  I was hoping to use the same brackets that most boat cover frames are made from.  I’m trying to find some old junker boats that I can use to salvage parts.  I need 8 “T” joints to assemble the frame.  I also need 8 mounting brackets to mount the frame to the boat.  Does anyone know where I can find a few old boats to salvage parts from??  I heard there are a few boat wreckers in the area (Simcoe County).  I did a quick Google search but didn’t find anything.  Thanks,  Tightlines, and straight shootin"
