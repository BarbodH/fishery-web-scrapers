381294,Dara,2009-09-09 17:26:00,3052,"and why.  I mean the ones cast on the spring thing. They come with a snap swivel at one end, and a curled eye in the centre, then the weight and a wire poking out. I have always  attached a 3 way to the snap swivel one eye to my line, and a worm harness (long one) to the thrd eye. I am seeing people attaching their line to the eye in the centre and the harness to the snap swivel.  Whats the proper way?  PS. I have been outfishing these guys 4 to one"

381301,Roy,2009-09-09 17:46:00,13728,"I attach my mainline to the ""curled eye"". Then to the snapswivel attach a length of mono/fluoro of weaker test than the mainline...usually 24"" to 48"", then to that attach my bait/lure/offering. Usually, the length of the leader depends on how far above the bottom you want your bait."
381368,doubleheader,2009-09-09 19:26:00,497,The method Roy described is the better one. If you're running harnesses it's much easier to swith them out.
381417,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-09 20:57:00,53,"Roy and DH have them figured out the same way I do. Tie directly onto the wire eye with your main line. I always tie up a number of different bait lines ahead of time using various line strengths, types and lengths with different hooks or harnesses. Also I tie an additional swivel to the end of the bait line that I attach to the snap swivel on the bottom bouncer. This eliminates line twist. Most of the bouncers have pretty low quality snap swivels on them. I wrap these pretied bait lines around a piece of a kid's swimming noodle to keep them organized in the boat. I've also had better luck using coloured bouncers than my buddy using the standard lead grey ones. I vary the length of the bait line to suit finicky fish as well as what Roy said about the distance of your bait off of the bottom. Jack."
381421,Dara,2009-09-09 21:05:00,3052,"Ok. I do all that with the line to the harness, short, long, extra swivels. I just don't use the hole in the bend of the sinker wire. With the 3 way swivel it hangs down sorta. I'll try it the other way and see how it works. I just never thought about it. From when I first picked one up, I rigged it that way. Now I'm seeing guys do it the other way and got to wondering."
381464,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-09 22:31:00,0,"I understood that you knew how the rig worked......lol  just that you used it differently is all. If it works better for you that way, perfect. I was pointing out that you would have a better feel of the bottom if you did it the way everyone else did."
