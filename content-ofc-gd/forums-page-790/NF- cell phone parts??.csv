380976,bigfish1965,2009-09-08 23:59:00,3382,Anyone know where to find used or inexpensive cell phone parts? My g/f bought a new LG 5500 and the battery cover fell off somewhere. We called LG and a new cover costs 50 bucks. The phone costs $100. Apparently half the value of the phone is tied up in the three square inches of plastic on the back of the phone...
