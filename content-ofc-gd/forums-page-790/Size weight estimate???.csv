380827,hoot33,2009-09-08 17:23:00,93,"I caught this guy up at my cottage at 2 am 1 foot off the end of the dock while pulling in a jitterbug, scared the crap out of me and my girlfriend but he was hooked pretty bad(no gill action) so wanting him to get home asap I didnt weigh or measure him, can anyone give me some estimates.  I was thinking around 4lbs 22 or more inches. Anyone else?     "
380845,BillM,2009-09-08 18:13:00,17367,"Kinda hard to tell by the pics, but I would say a good 2.5-3lbs."
380847,LucG,2009-09-08 18:19:00,779," I'd second that.  Nice catch, but it looks a few onces short of 4 lbs"
380850,Muskieman,2009-09-08 18:22:00,2472,length x length x length  divided by 1700 works great to figure out a Bass's weight   RFS 
380853,hoot33,2009-09-08 18:26:00,93,I didnt get a measurment either 
380859,LucG,2009-09-08 18:32:00,779, Really?!?!  That's pretty cool. How acurate is this calculation?
381013,splashhopper,2009-09-09 01:05:00,2931,"  That looks pretty close to the O.F.A.H fish estimator calculator..  I caught my PB smallie( by weight) this weekend.. and a guy weighed it for me on an old scale he had in his tackle box... it came up just over 6lbs...  I took measurements of the fish and checked it against that link I put up here and it showed a little over 6 lbs too..  I used the method described earlier in this thread..  L x L x L / 1700... 22 x 22 x 22 / 1700 = 6.26... a little over six again..  the only question I have of the method above is that I caught a 23"" smallie earlier this year and it didn't weight anywhere near the football one I caught this weekend...  compare these two pics for an example...  23"" caught a couple months ago >   and then this 22"" one I caught this weekend >>    BIG difference in weight.  I will take measurements and hope i get a digital scale for my birthday..  Splashhopper"
381043,Syn,2009-09-09 01:26:00,519,"You could get the length and height of your fish by taking a known measurement from the picture (say the distance between the center of you pupils) and by using a ruler and a math formula.  a is measure between you pupils in the picture. photo aspect ratio must be not altered in printout or on screen. b is the measure of the length of the fish in the picture.  divide a/b and you get a ratio.  then measure the distance between your pupils in real life using a mirror or a buddy with the ruler. This will give you value c.  so you have a/b=c/d.  cross multiple and you get d the length of the fish.  Use the same method to work out the figh height.  You could also work out the length and height of the mouth using your thumbnail as value a.    I painted small 5"" intervals on my bass rod so I just hold my rod by the bass to get a quick measure. or just carry a tiny dollar store 3ft measuring tape in your pocket. Its keychain size."
381095,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-09 02:03:00,2038,3lbs 13 ozs....
381101,badman187,2009-09-09 02:12:00,28,Just buy yourself a measuring from a store that sells fabrics or you can get them from pretty much anywhere.When its rolled up you wont even notice it in your tackle box.
381108,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-09 02:31:00,3761,Looks like a 3lb 8oz bucketmouth!  Congrads dude
381113,Cudz,2009-09-09 02:56:00,2652,"very close Mike.  It is actually 3.4 pounds or approx 3 pounds 6 and a half ounces. Largemouth always looks so big because, well, they have large mouthes."
381151,hoot33,2009-09-09 04:39:00,93,Ya I thought it was close to 4  either way my PB.
381162,singingdog,2009-09-09 10:41:00,1047,"I have been stuck like that a few times as well. I take a pic with the fish next to my rod handle, and use it for a length comparison later on. Nice fish!"
381168,otter649,2009-09-09 11:41:00,118, The formula I have for calcuating a fish's weight is :   Length x Girth x Girth divided by 800 =..............
