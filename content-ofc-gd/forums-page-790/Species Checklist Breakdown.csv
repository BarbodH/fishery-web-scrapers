380985,angrypigeon,2009-09-09 00:24:00,31," list contains many errors, which would be resolved if you read the book i recommended: 1. first of all ""sunfish"" is not a species.  it's a family of fish, to which sm bass, lm bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, warmouth belong 2. sucker and carp are also not species, but families 3. 30) king salmon = 31) chinook salmon = double-counting.  also, i assumed you meant ""chinook"", as there is no such thing as a ""pinook"" salmon  if you are doing something, pls do it right.  stop the spread of the invasive species known as ""misinformation"""
