We brought along the ""PenFishingRod""  to give it a try for some Largemouth and shot a short video for fun. I'm using my ""French Canadian redneck "" accent.    took a pic as well.     Tyler caught about  8 Largemouth of about the same size and a few sunfish. He also missed ""THE POND MONSTER""..  there a few LM's over 8lbs in that PRIVATE pond and my son had it on  It broke the ""PenFishingRod"" in half .....Got that on video too     RFS "

381539,Muskieman,2009-09-10 00:30:00,2472,"  The OFC T-Shirts were out on the line....  Sure is a nice pond.. the whole property is for sale 245.000.00...  22 acres .. private pond ..river water front small 3 bedroom house , barn style 2 door garage with loft .. and 4 serviced lots that are already severed. And a good bass fishery.  If someone buys it .. I'm afraid to lose my permission slip to C&R the pond... I just hope that the current owner puts in a good word for me.  RFS "
