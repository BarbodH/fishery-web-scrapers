380833,LucG,2009-09-08 17:41:00,779,"I was out fishing walleye this weekend and did extremely well with this rig.  I was using a single hook, 6 lbs flurocarbon leader, swivel, bead, sinker, then 10 lbs braided. As shown below:    But I had a small issue with the sinker. Once we would drift out of the deep water and into the shallows, the bass would start hitting. When they would put up their typical fight, I would lose the sinker.  This is the sinker I was using, and due to its key ring hole, I noticed it wasnt hard to remove it using a circular motion (like the fighting bass). After losing approx 5-6 sinkers, I switch over to the egg sinker. So my questionis... Is this supposed to happen, or is this a design flaw?    I also managed to hook onto this personal smallest pike. It bite a crankbait twice its size.  "

381087,pike slayer,2009-09-09 01:53:00,1177,should have used him as bait hahaha!
381186,LucG,2009-09-09 12:48:00,779,116 views and nobody has used these sinkers?
381191,Fishnwire,2009-09-09 12:57:00,983,I've used those sinkers and haven't had a problem.  I think all for walleye (with a rig simular to your) and I can't remember whether or not I fought any bass with one on.  They're made with that O ring like that so that they can come on and off without retying but I used to buy them made out of solid lead.  Once you put it on it couldn't come off unless you broke or cut the line. Try to find some of those.  They're more snag resistant than egg sinkers.   I once caught a pike that would have been quite comfy in my fish tank.  It too hit a minnow bait fully twice it's length.
381204,Garry2Rs,2009-09-09 13:27:00,1425,I have also used those Lindy type sinker with a solid eye instead of a split ring. It appears that the thin 10 pound braid is the problem. Use a heavier running line or a drop of Krazy Glue on the split ring.

381364,LucG,2009-09-09 19:15:00,779," Surprisingly enough, this little guy was sporting a very nice sharp set a teeth."
