381302,l2p,2009-09-09 17:48:00,346,"First of all im stating this now in the beginning of the the post.... i will not tell anyone where i fished. This is because i went out on my own time with my friends and put in our leg work to find these fish, and i feel everyone should do the same. Anyways just ENJOY the pics....   Ho ho's for days            some chinney love, one and only fish to bite the dust this year..      So i start working again tomorow after a two and half weeks off, everyone have a safe a fun salmon season!"
381307,tonyb,2009-09-09 17:53:00,1637,Stellar early season tribbin' lads! well done.  You put your legwork in and it paid off!  How was the elbow-room on those drifts? lol  Tony
381308,Roy,2009-09-09 17:53:00,13728,"Yeah, I'm with you, let the Gatorade flow! That was a pretty negative way to start a thread but thanks for the great pics. You did really well."
381310,BrownTown,2009-09-09 17:54:00,103,Nice work. Wish i wasn't working overtime this week!
381313,l2p,2009-09-09 18:00:00,346,"haha i guess it was kinda negative... i just didnt want a full inbox of ""where did you go fishing"" or  ""hey your my friend right?"" msgs... i felt like it was a valid point to put out. thanks for the comments! the early bird gets the first worm!"
381321,PMack,2009-09-09 18:14:00,9,"Hate hate hate hate hate.....   Nice fishin!!!  CHeers,  PMack"
381323,Syn,2009-09-09 18:23:00,519,Very cool fish  pics. What program did you use to make the swirls?
381328,johnnyb,2009-09-09 18:26:00,3413,that looks like a really sweet mixed bag there...thanks for the pics to get us drooling   Are you above at least sharing with us what the hot tactic was?
381332,Greencoachdog,2009-09-09 18:31:00,8163,You can tell me where you caught those fish... I promise I won't tell anybody else!
381333,highdrifter,2009-09-09 18:31:00,2534,Nice work guys!!  I hope to do some violating of my own this sat...   Photoshop!!    cheers HD
381336,Syn,2009-09-09 18:35:00,519," ok thanks, I suspected that was the culprit. I might have need of  it soon for muskie fishing.  I'd ask my buddy in Forensics to see if he can ""unswirl"" those pics above of the fish. lol j/k hmmm... "" If you can postulate the degree of the swirl effect used. Entering the exact negative amount will yield and ""un-swirled"" picture as if it were new but slightly pixilated."""
381338,highdrifter,2009-09-09 18:38:00,2534, 
381339,dobee,2009-09-09 18:39:00,301,beauty fish!
381340,Greencoachdog,2009-09-09 18:41:00,8163,"  Looks more like the ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" program to me."
381342,ecmilley,2009-09-09 18:44:00,2163,Nice fish thanks for sharing
381347,Leecher,2009-09-09 18:52:00,7832,Some good looking ones in those pics!!! Congrats Leechman
381361,highdrifter,2009-09-09 19:14:00,2534, Yeah the skies do seem a bit marmalade!  Am I giving you flashbacks dawg??!
381370,l2p,2009-09-09 19:26:00,346,actually if u just upload your pics through photobucket and click the edit button there is an option to let u blurr out objects or in this case backgrounds! && secret tactic was float fishing with bright coloured flies and roe
381380,CLofchik,2009-09-09 19:42:00,854,"Lol, how do I ask the guy where he caught the fish now?  If it's not the river I know still has a run of coho it would be good info for egg collection later on.  No really, it's for the greater good of the resource, really really!"
381387,aplumma,2009-09-09 20:07:00,6896,All of that work just to take the steeples out of the backround...... Nice fish wish we had them down here in Virginia  Art
