If any of you have ended up moving out west for work shoot me a note.  I must do some searching for CrappiePerchHunter if he's still around here.  The fishing in Northern Alberta is quite productive although a lake out here is what you would call a pond back home.  I thought Id stop by and say hi.  Heres a picture of the pooch on the Peace River cooling down. "
380634,chinookhunter,2009-09-08 00:29:00,68,I hunted in that valley

380662,Cookslav,2009-09-08 01:06:00,1457,"Hey bud,  Nice to see your still kicking around! You hit up Lesser Slave yet?  Not too far, and worth the drive I'm told?"
380695,KyleM,2009-09-08 02:05:00,218,"Yeah, its worth the drive aslong as you catch her on a friendly weather day!  You still have my old boat?"
380698,splashhopper,2009-09-08 02:07:00,2931,No pics of fish from the west ? welcome back..
380708,holdfast,2009-09-08 02:21:00,1813,"Say Hi to my buddy in High Level.  By the way, where abouts is the Picture of the Peace.  Closest city or town, just curious."
380731,crappieperchhunter,2009-09-08 03:21:00,2582,I PM'd you Kyle. Thx for the letter and thx for stopping to visit my old man. BTW did you manage a stroll down to the Grand for some Brown's when you where back in Fergus?  Also...love the picture.
380743,KyleM,2009-09-08 04:08:00,218,"No problem steve, I think he came down the road to visit me actually! It was good to see him again.   holdfast, the closest town to that picture I suppose would be Rycroft... I live between there and Sexsmith in the Saddle Hills, its about a 25 min drive."
380758,Joey,2009-09-08 12:01:00,9122,"Nice to hear from you again Kyle.  Hope you are enjoying Alberta.  Even tho their lakes are ""ponds,"" I found the river fishing to be fantastic.  Have you tried the Bow River up near Canmore yet?   Besides the fantastic view, the rainbows are just gorgeous, and tasty.  I learned how to fly fish on that river and it was an experience I won't soon forget.  Joey"
380864,wuchikubo,2009-09-08 18:43:00,1114,"Good to hear from you, but where are the fishing pics?!!  Beautiful country out that way for sure, I was out there at the beginning of July."
381103,holdfast,2009-09-09 02:16:00,1813," My all time favorite lake is Wolf Lake, between Lac LaBiche and Cold Lake.  A couple of Hours NE of Edmonton."
381274,Cookslav,2009-09-09 16:15:00,1457," Yup, Still treating me well too Lots of miles on her, as if she didn't have them before LOL!"
