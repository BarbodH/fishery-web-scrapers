377016,John Bacon,2009-08-27 02:48:00,3277, Permits are required to repave a driveway in Toronto.  This is the first year that is being rigourisly enforced.
377097,Cookslav,2009-08-27 13:47:00,1457,"Ya...Bylaws & Permits can be ridiculous sometimes.  I installed a Woodstove this year, ""somebody"" didn't like the look of my Chimney(beatuifull stainless, double wall stove pipe...) So the Bylaw guy came by, said I needed a Permit...news to me, as I've installed 2 before. So down to City hall I go... Apparently the codes have changed and now I need to install an HRV unit in order to install wood stove.(heat recovery vent) So in other words a simple air return system to equalize the pressure is no longer good enough...I need to HEAT my return air. I battled with the office for a while and eventually found a loop hole. I needed to PROVE with an EXTERNAL licensed vendor that I had adequet return air as it was not code that the air must be heated. So I end up paying R.E.E.P to come perform a Blower test and all is good($350 later, but it beats the heck out of a $3000 HRV)  So the Inspector comes...looks at the blower test result, looks at the placement of the stove and approves me! No Clearance meausurments, the guy didn't even have a measureing tape on him, no chimney inspection...nothing  So riddle me this Batman... If I need the Fire dept to inspect my stove for safety certification before the insurance company will insure me, what business does the city have with inspecting my fireplace?  Nothing but a cash Grab...$100 permit, and $350 to R.E.E.P (both operated by the municipality) and they appease the tree huggers by making an HRV part of the code(to bad for them I found a loop hole!)"
377113,Headhunter,2009-08-27 14:27:00,5703,"Well, if they force me to get a permit, even though it was a simple replacement, nothing added, I guess I'll invoice the city for the amount I paid to have the boulevard portion of the driveway paved... because let's face it, I don't own that portion of land! HH"
377133,Ziki,2009-08-27 15:55:00,128,"Not surprising this is the first result when googling ""paving permit""  $127 paving permit called cash grab"
377136,Cookslav,2009-08-27 16:15:00,1457,"Yup... They won't pay on some exuse that it wasn't approved or somthing like that. I swear the Bylaw officers get commision in K/W LOL....  This same Bylaw officer that came also checked to see if I had a permit for my Deck while he was here(luckily I did get one) And also nailed our Neighbors for their deck which must now be basically torn down to make a long story short...  I don't beleive Permits are required for Driveways here though? If the do they would be sitting on a gold mine should they come back to my street... I organized the Paving of 8 driveways, and in turn they ended up selling their services to 4 more homes on this street, non of which was done with a permit.  I want out of the city so bad... But the Wife is a city gal so I'm stuck.  My Property taxes go up and up on a yearly basis, yet services are cut... When I was young we raked the leaves to the curb, and the city picked them up...not any more. Now yard waste must be bagged and is only picked up every 2 weeks. They used to send the street cleaners through almost monthly through the spring, summer and Fall...I have not seen one in 3 years They used to plow my street after every major snow fall...now it sometimes takes weeks to clean up the mess.  What I don't understand is the increasing taxes, and permit fees etc...? As more and more homes are built, more and more people are moving into the city and paying taxes... There are WAY more tax dollars comming in, and less services? A single neighborhood street with 100 homes paying $3000/year in taxes gives the city $300,000 in YEARLY taxes. There is NO WAY snow removal, hydro for the street lamps, garbage pick up, general yearly Maintence of the street, storm Water/sewer services is going to cost any where near $300K a year... And truthfully My taxes are actually closer $4,000/year, and there are 300 houses on my street.  And then I get dinged with Useless Permits to boot... I get that ""some"" bylaws, and permits are valid for protection of public saftey, and perhaps even the potential Devaluation of neighborhood homes but geeeze....a Permit for a wood stove when you have to have it inspected by the Fire dept any way? Thats a cash grab  Like I said...I want out of the city."
377158,LeXXington,2009-08-27 17:18:00,1928," They are making by-laws now just to make you conform too someone else standard.  ~YES COMRAD  There was a big joke on the radio today that some towns have by-laws for using power tools outside on Sunday!!  You think its only bad in the city,, I bought some land, the town provides NO services too me other than maybe plowing the road yet I have too conform to by-laws for the local town??  Problem is goverement is over stepping their bounds,  and have the law too enforce it. When that tell you too pay more try telling them no."
377161,Lunatic,2009-08-27 17:23:00,536,"We've been going thru the same crap for years. used to get snow removal now we dont etc.  Here is an interesting story... a few years ago we got hit hard with snow during the night. I wake up early for work 5:30am,look out the window...wow,lots of snow. have a shower,start making breakfast,look out the window,lots of snow...no plows,hmm...oh well, go to leave and 4 or 5 neighbours are  stuck on the street trying to go to work, hmmm ,whats one more car, i launch out the drive-way and make it half way down the small road we live on and i get stuck, all of us end up stuck for about 3 hours and in the end we shoveled ourselves out and we had all called in to work not gonna make it today. i finally get off the road and i park it, i walk back to the house sit around for a few hours, still no plows. so i call a friend and decide to go to a high performance car part store,pick up some stuff, as i drive to his place to pick him up i drive by many roads and none of them are plowed...hmmm the main roads are plowed. i have to drive by a welfare neighbourhood (anyone in hamilton will know Oreol cresent) its completely cleaned out and plowed, townhouses,and apartment.......what the hell. the roads around it...plowed, what the hell? i pick up said friend and tell him about it and he says its like that all the time no one can figure it out. so we decide  to drive to another welfare area, and its cleaned up and plowed.  I remember this to this day because these people have no jobs. most,no cars. Where do they have to go that they become first priority?  btw- we didnt get snow removal untill the 3rd day after the snowfall.   other notable cash grab Bull artists: lawyers/dentists/insurance compaines, oh and my new enemy, conservation areas lol"
377168,bigfish1965,2009-08-27 17:47:00,3382,"When I lived in Fonthill, it was all pretty straight forward stuff..nobody really cared what the neighbour did and likely most of us were violating an ordinance or two, but we all had big lots ( 1 acre ) and backed onto farms. The town actually go tired of responding to burn complaints for people burning leaves or having bonfires, so the legalized it instead... just had to do leaf burning during daylight hours and bonfires were fine as long as you had a designated pit or chiminea. Now St Catharines has more rules, but everyone on the street seems to be on the same page. We each have a small fire pit, we all keep our dogs in after 11 PM, we don't care how tall your fence is, we check with our neighbours before we build anything and basically keep the town out of it. We have bylaws for building new things but not much for replacing or repairing existing things. The city came by after my neighbour redid his porch and asked me what was there before...I said looks the same to me....the officer said their records indicate the porch was much smaller before...I said it probably looked that way cause of the trees...lol. He left satisfied with that answer, even though it made no sense."
377172,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-27 18:01:00,1022,"Its a good thing you have good neighbours Rick. We started to build our shed and the neighbour complained that it was too close to her fence, so we had to demolish it, good thing we only poured in the concrete on the posts."
377183,bigfish1965,2009-08-27 18:33:00,3382," Yes....the only worse than rules that make no sense are people that don't. IMHO my neighbours property is his own, to do with as he pleases. What difference can it possibly make how close a shed is to a fence? Isn't it better closer so you don't have to worry about that little strip of land growing huge weeds cause you can't mow it?? Manure is legal in almost every town since they banned most pesticides and fertilizers. Maybe a fresh coating of well aged manure on your flower beds is in order...lol."
377186,SBCregal,2009-08-27 18:40:00,688,i believe most of the bylaws regarding buildings near the property line have to do with water runoff and drainage etc.  i'm pretty sure you can build closer to the property line if the shed/building has eavestroughs for the rainwater.  ryan
381382,fishermccann,2009-09-09 19:45:00,655,"Lots of things that you don't see are paid out of your taxes,  eg. civic nursing homes, animal control etc."
381385,CLofchik,2009-09-09 20:04:00,854, ...Welfare and social services that have been downloaded...  Lol the reason the subsidized housing folks get plowed first is because those are the people that know how to play the system.  Heck one minute past the deadline for snow removal there would be a down right bottleneck of slip & falls from people trying to sue the city!

376504,BillM,2009-08-25 23:00:00,17367,  Common sense and law rarely go together in the same sentence..  Did the contractor who did the driveway have a permit?

376566,JohnF,2009-08-26 01:25:00,3494,"Zoning bylaws are definitely a pita when they work against your wishes. But what about when they do their job and protect the quality of life you enjoy, and more importantly perhaps when they protect your property's value by setting the bar for what your neighbours can do with their properties. Tn thehe problem with letting you bend the rules is that the bylaw can't be enforced against your neighbours either, and who knows what could happen to the neighbourhood if everyone made the rules to suit themselves. How would y'all like a slaughterhouse being built on the next door property? Or have the neighbour start selling adult entertainment stuff from his livingroom and having his pervy customers park on the front lawn and ogle yer daughters as they head in for a little shopping? These are extreme examples but without bylaws who knows what would pass for an acceptable standard with some folks?  That's why your ""minor"" exception has to be addressed properly. You may well get it passed as a minor variance (if you go thru the proper channels).  JF"
376568,bigfish1965,2009-08-26 01:31:00,3382,"I agree with you fully John, but I think the part of having to pay $400 for a variance request is far beyond reasonable. These people already got paid. It is not a pay per service idea, it is a deterrent. It reminds me of the towns that don't let you park your boat in your own driveway. Good ideas completely blown to heck. Nothing makes people dumber than to put them into an organized committee..."
376582,JohnF,2009-08-26 01:40:00,3494,"  Yup. That's a tad greedy, but it is what it is, so methinks he'll just have to suck it up and ante up if he hopes to keep the drive the way it is. The municipality cashgrab is a fight for another day.  JF"
376634,John Bacon,2009-08-26 02:52:00,3277,"Are in one of the cities that were amalgamated into Toronto?  I.e. Scarborough, North York, etc.  I am in Scarborough and I remember reading that Scarborough began requiring permits to pave driveways in 2007.  The date that you have may be the date that permits became mandatory for paving, not when the by-law was created.  It is only this year that they had the man power to enforce the law.  A lot of people have illegal driveways in Scarborough because there was never any enforcement of the rules.  I imagine that other former cities such as Etobicoke and North York are in the same situation.  I am surprised that they would bother you now; I would have expected them to wait until you repaved to enforce the rules.  Maybe one of the neighbors complained.  To anyone else in Scarborough; the city now has employees that drive around looking for driveways that are being paved and make sure they have permits.  We can no longer get away with paving in front of the house etc.  Plan your driveway accordingly, and budget the extra $100 or so for a permit."
376638,John Bacon,2009-08-26 03:00:00,3277," I am not sure where he is, but I know that Scarborough only began requiring permits to pave a driveway in 2007.  They have only begun to enforce it this year.  So that comment may be unfair."
376684,Lunatic,2009-08-26 08:41:00,536,"Thats right. I remember years ago,a main sewer pipe had cracked (from age it was clay) It happened 1 foot in on the front lawn from the road.Naturally since the city claims something like 10' of your property from the road,My dad called the city and told them about it. They own that property,so they should be responsible right?? wrong! They said its not their problem,so we had to go thru insurance,which wouldnt cover it( act of ""god"") So we were on the hook for 7g worth of work and damage.  moral of this story is,Its the cities property only when its conveiniant for them,but if someone breaks their neck or something goes wrong within that 10' its your problem. double standard. what can ya do."
376687,Lunatic,2009-08-26 08:47:00,536,"I may be completely wayyy off on this one. but i remember hearing once that if you maintained a piece of property for something like 3...5..or 10 years? that it becomes yours. i have no idea if there is any truth to this,but i remember my friend getting mad any time his neighbour mowed over his line into his  (about 2 feet or so) because of that theory. I also know another friend who lives next to a nice bit of land (enough to plant another home) that the town has ignored for more than 10 years, and it became 5 foot grass, so he had been maintaining it for the past 5 years or so. So maybe it will become his by default.  this could be some crazy myth,but it may be something to look into, since it went un-noticed for so long.  could be a different situation tho. i know that there are zoning laws and such that do not alow you to build garages and shed etc. within a foot of your neighbours property,so maybe your drive way falls under that area? who knows."
376701,TC1OZ,2009-08-26 11:59:00,987,  lol squatters rights? That doesn't make any sense.  And to your earlier post...obviously the law only applies when its in the cities favor! (I had assumed that was understood...same with insurance companies)

I wonder if fees like this aren't another by-product of a lack of funding these days, another form of user fee.

The widening really bothers nothing. (as far as I know) The by-law was likely made to keep people from making huge driveways. The way the law is written it is all encompassing and will now cost $400.00 to get around when it was never written for the reason at hand. There should be some attachment to these laws as to why they were made in the first place to make them reviewable and non applicable in certain instances. Discresion of the by-law officer or whatever. I know this opens a whole other can of worms, but darnit, its our country, our city, we pay the taxes and should get something for it. Not just treated like a piece of crap and told it will cost us money every time we need an explanation as to why were are being ripped off.

Then they said its actually cities property...something like 4 Meters from the center of the road, onto the front of your property isn't technically yours....

Due to a rogers cable box on our lawn the only way to accommodate a 2 car wide driveway was to put the extension on an angle. Due to this angle the driveway is now too wide for zoning regulations. Now my problem is that I don't have $400 to give to a special committee of seven, to explain this to them and then HOPE they understand and approve my application. Can I wait for the MLEO to take me to court and then explain myself then and there?  TC1OZ what happened with your unplated car?"

They own the end of my property that I pay taxes on...I have one of those L shaped drive ways...and I guess to park a car at the end of my property (base of the L 5 feet away from the shoulder of the road) it has to have plates on it. Since its technically city property the rules of the road apply to that part of my drive way.  I had to push it about a car length up the straight part of my drive way...now I just park half on the lawn with my van! HAHAHAHA! They don't own that part and it has plates! I could park my van at the end of the road, but then its a long walk to the house hahaha.  And it looks like you are screwed man. Any work on your property needs to have a work order created with the city to verify if you are breaking any zoning laws or encroaching on someone else's (their) property.  The only reason I know lots about this work order issue, is because I'm currently dealing with a lawsuit involving the house I purchased almost 2 years ago...the city has wiped their hands clean because they throw away records older than 30 years old, my title insurance doesn't cover it because they say its a structural problem but if I had paperwork from the city stating it existed before I got here then it would be covered....But now I am suing for non-disclosure of the issue and in their defense they say there was a problem but they got it fixed...THEY TOLD US THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS AND THATS WHY WE ARE SUING!!!! lol idiots...Court is a long process! Try to do what you can to avoid it...because if you have to pay your lawyer up front its not coming back to you unless you win...."

376369,Ziki,2009-08-25 17:41:00,128,Well I'm off to the store to buy some indoor outdoor grass carpet   I'll let you guys know how well it works out.
376375,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 17:53:00,987," Ummmm maybe if they take a peek from the road...but since you are in the system they are going to actually look into it and force the Work Order or take you to court and sue you for the cost of them to carry out the work order.  You might be better off just digging up some dirt and putting it on, a little more believable....but you are dreaming if you don't think they are going to bring a shovel to verify."
376386,Ziki,2009-08-25 18:12:00,128,"It isn't a driveway if it has grass on it, and there is nothing wrong with parking on your lawn.  BUT if you pave it so you don't have a dirt patch on your lawn your breaking the bylaw.  Refer to title"
376396,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 18:58:00,987,  Fake grass isn't grass....they will check to see if the structure has been removed.
376410,PAZE,2009-08-25 19:42:00,132,"From what I understand parking on your lawn is a by-law offence aswell, so since you got them going now they'll throw everything at you, work with them not against them. One of your neibourghs must have complained or someone down the street that was pist you had a bigger driveway, either way this might be a long battle, good luck and hope it works out."
376417,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 19:54:00,987," I suggested working with the guy, doesn't seem like he wants to take that route.  But that was obvious when they built the drive way without getting a permit for the construction. The city would of told the contractors before they even dug that this would not be legal.  Seems like the company you choose may have saved you a couple of bucks up front by not getting a work permit, but now this is the headache you have to deal with.  As for parking on your lawn it depends on where you are located. Its not always a by-law offense. In Fort Erie lots of people just park where ever on the lawn because they do not have any drive way...just all dirt or grass."
376435,LeXXington,2009-08-25 20:42:00,1928,"LOL, I think it's acutally a by-law office not too have a paved driveway in mississauga and yes there is a by-law too park on the grass.  By-laws are just a way too make money and let you know that although you may feel you are the king of your castle really you are just renting with the goverment telling you want too do.  best by-law!!! == NO MORE BY-LAWS!!!"
376436,Ziki,2009-08-25 20:43:00,128, Are you really surprised I didn't listen to your suggestion?    Not the ending I want for my story.
376450,TC1OZ,2009-08-25 21:13:00,987,  You are ignoring the facts...  You shouldn't of paved your drive way without a work permit legalizing the construction.  Simple enough...  Do things right the first time...and then you wont have to deal with this....
376463,Woodsman,2009-08-25 21:27:00,1286,Sounds like your contractor skipped a few steps & now your being held accountable. Contact the contractor who did the job and verify he had all proper permits & inspections at the time of construction. If not you have legal cause to hold him responsible. Now if you hired a non licensed contractor you may have got just what you payed for.  Rick
376486,Ziki,2009-08-25 22:13:00,128, You are ignoring common sense. My extra foot of driveway space isn't bothering anyone now more than it was for the last 5 years.  This is a blatant cash grab. $400 so a committee of seven can ponder if I can have an extra foot of driveway width on my property.
