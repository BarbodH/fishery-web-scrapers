381057,Greencoachdog,2009-09-09 01:35:00,8163,"Good to Know Cussing Is Good for You: A study by psychology researchers at Britain's Keele University in July showed that people who swear in response to a danger are better able to endure pain than those who use milder language. [Daily Telegraph, 7-12-09]   Maybe that's why I weave a tapestry of obscenities whenever I have to remove a fish hook from my flesh!"
381062,Carp,2009-09-09 01:39:00,1488,"So, if we cuss at you because you look like an ax murderer, it's good for us ?  I can live with that.   LOL !!!"

381068,Greencoachdog,2009-09-09 01:43:00,8163,"  I'd just like you to know, that is the nicest thing anyone has said to me in a very long time!!!"

381175,John,2009-09-09 12:16:00,2956," No, no Glen, you are supposed to have someone else remove the hook. It's much more effective cussin' at others. That's when you can use the really creative vocabulary."
381176,John,2009-09-09 12:17:00,2956, I figured that a creative guy like you used a chain saw. Much more efficient.
