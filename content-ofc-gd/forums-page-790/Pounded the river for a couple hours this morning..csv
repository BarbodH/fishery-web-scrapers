Not bad for G-bay fish.T he first one i caught had a nasty lamprey on him but was a trooper cause he had three other scars on him! Took his passenger off and let him free. Heres a few pics, enjoy!

381371,ciscokid,2009-09-09 19:27:00,52,"SOme nice fish.. hey wondering if u d let me know how u caught those cause u have a spinning reel and all, everyone i see salmon fishing has the fancy equipment and i dont so im just trying figure out how to catch salmon with my regualr bass rod and maybe spoons on jigs? never seen anyone doing it but i ve heard it can work."
381501,ehg,2009-09-09 23:31:00,2666,That middle fish does look quite fresh. Nice of you to remove the lamprey hopefully you expired the lampreys life.
381525,timmeh,2009-09-10 00:04:00,609,  You can get salmon on spoons as you thought. Make sure the rod you're using is strong enough though and you'll want to spool on some stronger line than you may be using for bass.
381617,steelhead hunter,2009-09-10 01:44:00,152,it looks like he was casting crank baits. you don't need fancy equipment to fish salmon you can float fish with a spining reel you just get a better presenation with a float reel
