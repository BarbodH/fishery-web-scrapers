380969,Fishnwire,2009-09-08 23:49:00,983,"The closest camp to mine is about three KMs down river.  It's owned by a guy named Omer who's about sixty, but in really good shape and still driving truck about 50 hours a week.  His house is a lot closer to our camps than mine is, so when the shackles connecting the leaf springs to my trailer broke on the way home, I dropped it off in his yard.  I asked if it was OK if I left it there and that I'd be back the next day or two to work on it.  He said no problem.  I called him today to see if it was OK for me to use his tools, or should I bring my own.  ""Oh that's all done,""  he says.  ""It's ready to go.  I can drop it off if you want.""  Then he goes on to tell me he didn't like how it was put together and made a change or two...manufacturing the parts he needed from stock.  ""You should be able to beat the hell out of it now,"" was what I was told.  Now what do you say about a guy like that?  He's just an amazing person.  I'm humbled to know the guy, because I realize that I'm selfish by comparison.  I know someone who's getting the biggest bottle of the best Wiser's on the shelf."
