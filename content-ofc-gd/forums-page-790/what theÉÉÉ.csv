Please do not tell me what it is, I paid attention in school, I just want it gone.  My key board works fine for word docs and other web sites.  IdeasÉÉÉ  Thanks for the help."
380902,LucG,2009-09-08 19:56:00,779,I remember that happend to me once. I had my keyboard set to the french setting.
380903,Terry,2009-09-08 19:58:00,14456,ןoן˙˙˙ sɯǝןqoɹd ǝʌɐɥ noʎ ʞuıɥʇ noʎ    change the keyboard language it might be on your task bar  or in your  settings control panel  change default language to english US and you will not have to deal with that again..it's french
380904,Roy,2009-09-08 19:59:00,13728,"Rob, bottom right of your screen there's an icon of a keyboard. Click on it and selct US   you're in French mode."
380905,kickingfrog,2009-09-08 20:01:00,8333,"I know what accent aigu and accent grave are. I want to know why this appears to be the only place that my key board now suddenly wants to use them, and how to switch my key board back."
380906,highdrifter,2009-09-08 20:02:00,2534,"Check out your system tray... bottom right hand side of your screen.  If you see a little case with FR (french), click on it and select EN (English).  And if youève got a francamophone using your puter, tell em to use their own!!  àààèèèéééêêêêÉÉÉ!!!"
380908,Terry,2009-09-08 20:07:00,14456,this is the only place that it does that  now that is strange......
380919,PikeMolester,2009-09-08 20:40:00,428,ya its french...press shift 6 for question marks
380929,kickingfrog,2009-09-08 21:27:00,8333," Now I feel more like a tool because I do not see that Icon.   I am the closest thing to a francophone (I am almost an anglophone  ) using this keyboard and it happened mid post.    Yes it is, and annoying.    Thanks, that works until I can figure this out. And I found the quotations and commas too."
380932,Roy,2009-09-08 21:41:00,13728,"Rob, the problem is that there's a short cut to access different language keyboards. The keyboard shortcut to access the French keyboard happens to be a combination of keys that are used often but you have to do a typo to get the keyboard. It happens to me often. I believe it's CTRL+something. BUT what you  (and I) probably want is SHIFT+ something so, the typo converts to the French keyboard. I'll look at it tonight to figure out which it is and which key combo brings it back to either US or Canadian multilingual standard."
380938,Terry,2009-09-08 21:49:00,14456,he can change it in control if it's not on the task bar but he knows that he says the problem is it only happens on this website so I would think it is more then just the FR setting  for the key board
