381536,Mattones,2009-09-10 00:27:00,587,My father and his friend agreed to both sign up so myself and his daughter could do the test and get it. My father did it that night which was a month ago and she passed. Now I'm here asking every other day if his friend has signed up yet and he still hasent.  gahh
381547,boatman,2009-09-10 00:39:00,350,That sucks. I'm signed up as a supervisor. If your friend can't do it drop me a line and I can supervise for you. I'm in Hamilton.

The had a booth at the Exhibition for the duration of the fair and I have also recently seen them set up near Bay and Front in Toronto.  If you pass, you pay and they will issue you your Card. - If you fail, you don;t pay.  Simple and no risk ."
