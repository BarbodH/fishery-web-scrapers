This kind of fishing requires some adjustments from the stained water fishing. Early on the wind was simply brutal and from the east generating ferocious waves which made things very tough. We knew the wind was supposed to die down then change directions around mid-day, or so it was forecasted. We moved out of the rough stuff to find some shelter, on some other areas we marked on the map that seem promising which also had some wind cover. We moved around for a few hours looking for just the right kind of vegetation and structure. Sometimes the maps show bumps that are not really there when you get over top of and this makes for some wasted time looking around. So we moved to a spot which seem to be in the middle of nowhere. Well middle of nowhere was home to a musky! Two of them actually. Two little guys, we did not even take a picture of one them because it was maybe 22 inches long and we just shook it off to save time in hopes to get a bigger while the bite was on.     We kept moving along looking for another area that might hold some fish, we cross an old man in a small boat trolling, so he asked us how the bite was and we said so so, he sais it he had not seen a thing yet. So we waved and wished him luck. Five minutes go by and musky number three shows up! Another little one!     These fish has nice colors that we wanted to take pictures of them anyway. We take a few shots then release the fish, and continue on our way through this area of thick vegetation. The the door bell rings, another fish? Yep! A better sized one this time. Maybe 40-43inches.     So finally we hit one the last areas where we are sure will hold fish, and strong fish given the current flowing through there. Oh and I did I mention the wind had just changed directions? Yup the wind had drastically turned around. This woke up another musky! The one we were looking for!  "
