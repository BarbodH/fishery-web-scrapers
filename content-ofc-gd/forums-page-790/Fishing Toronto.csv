I have just moved from Welland to Toronto to attend film school. My question for everyone is, are there any good bass fishing spots around Toronto from shore? I am living in East York. I have been looking at some maps and trying to find some posts on the matter but just can't seem to find too much. I don't want anyone to give me their secret spot or anything but just a point in the right direction. I read a few things saying that you can find some largemouth at the Toronto islands, but when I checked satellite images it seems like a big area I don't know where to start. And I couldn't find if you need a permit or anything to fish there. Any information will be greatly appreciated, and if anyone lives in the area and wants to get out and fish I am always looking for fishing partners!"
380940,Syn,2009-09-08 21:51:00,519,I don't expect much good bass fishing in metro lakes  but imo Toronto Islands should be better because lake Ontario is much bigger. Also godd salmon fishing going on in the Humber river (and Credit river in Mississauga).  http://www.wfn.tv/experts/protips/fishingtips114.html http://www.wfn.tv/experts/protips/fishingtips115.html  http://www.dailyxy.com/lead-stories/the-tr...ing-in-toronto/   and http://www.fishingfury.com/tags/toronto/

381155,ciscokid,2009-09-09 06:23:00,52,"Grenadier Pond in High Park has lots of good shore fishing for large mouths, lots of small ones but i know someone who's caught a few 4 pounders in there so they can get big, and theres some pike there as well. Its good if u dont have a boat cause theres paths leading most of the way around it and plenty of good spots to find.  Another good bass spot few people kno of, although its to late in the season now but theres always next year, is the credit river from the opener till the end of august. Lots of nice smallmouths ( some really nice ones) in the deep pools from the mouth till the dam."
381220,ehg,2009-09-09 14:08:00,2666,"Welcome to Toronto, the fishing can be had here but much legwork and some luck is involved. The Toronto Islands can be fished, some pike are caught in the spring and largemouth bass in the summer. Throwing inline spinners, jerkbaits even spinnerbaits can produce. Some people target carp and bullheads there as well.  Closer to where you live Ashbridges Bay has some fish even some salmon are caught there where it empties into Lake Ontario, on spoons.  Checking out any of the lakeshore and trying an assortment of lures might produce something. Need to put in the time!"

381341,Syn,2009-09-09 18:43:00,519,"guys I reported the useless post. Thats all thats needed. Please continue talking fishing.   I use to fish at the pond at eglinton flats, caught pike, small largemouth there.  But it was exceptional for fishing for panfish, sunfish and crappy using a thill bobber, 4lb test, ans worms. Good times with the ultralight rod."

381354,highdrifter,2009-09-09 19:01:00,2534,Where abouts in East York are ya??  The islands are a good bet for largies but there's some good smallie water in your parts too!!
381363,CrankbaitJon,2009-09-09 19:15:00,13,I had some fun trips at Grenadier Pond.  Where can I park my car if I want to fish for Smallies in Credit River?
