381282,Mr Mojo Risin,2009-09-09 16:46:00,17,So I'm going on a work fishing trip (only one night / 2 days ) and heading to Rice Lake this weekend.. Never been on this lake before and would like any tips for the walleye and musky in there. bass tips are appreciated too but will mostly be targeting the 'eyes and musky.  I've got the gear just need to know which lures / bait these guys hit. I know there is  alot of pressure on the water so any tips to increase MY odds would greatly be appreciated
381283,Mr Mojo Risin,2009-09-09 16:47:00,17,...oh ya... I'm staying near the Roseneath Area if that helps...
381298,Beans,2009-09-09 17:34:00,3339, Try casting the edges of mid-lake weed beds|humps...
381860,Mr Mojo Risin,2009-09-10 18:26:00,17, U mean plunking down over the edges ? or along them ? what baits ? bucktails ?
