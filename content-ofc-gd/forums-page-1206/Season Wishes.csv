78393,Pete Maina,2007-06-02 13:36:00,213,"Hey OFNers,   I just wanted to stop in and say hi here - to offer best wishes for the upcoming fishing season (I know, we're well into it, but us northerner-muskie-dopes are just now getting rolling)!!  It's raining a little here, so not in a big hurry to get out today, but expect the Maina-clan (son, dad ... possibly a brother) will be out to harrass a variety of species later today.  Starting Tuesday ... official muskie ready-set-go.  Best of luck to you all. Be safe and have fun!  Pete"
