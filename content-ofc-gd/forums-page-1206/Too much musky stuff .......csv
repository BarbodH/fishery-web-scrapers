77664,steve_paul,2007-05-31 17:28:00,658,"good luck this weekend Lew.  i figure as long as I have less stuff than my wife has shoes, I have a valid argument.  She has lots of shoes so I have room for a few more shopping trips."
77669,Joey,2007-05-31 17:47:00,9122,"Paul has enough lures thank you very much Lew, you just keep your believer  The best of luck to you this weekend  Go get em!!!  Joey"
77688,kennyman,2007-05-31 18:28:00,737,"Wow, now that's a pile!    Here's wishing you a great successful weekend. If anybody deserves a 50 incher this weekend it's you bud.  Have a good one."
77899,Mike the Pike,2007-06-01 02:44:00,3421,You need a bigger boat Lew.  This should hold everything.    MTP
77910,Greencoachdog,2007-06-01 03:07:00,8163,I'll adopt all of your Jailbird Believers if ya need to find a good home for them Lew!
77920,Nanook,2007-06-01 03:40:00,565,"Good luck this w/end Lew.If ya going near the Bridgenorth Causeway launch, I noticed its badly weeded up this year. Never seen it like that before.  As for excess tackle, take it to Lakair and have a 'lea market', Prolly pay for your stay at Lakair  G'luck to ya"
78024,Deano,2007-06-01 13:32:00,767,"I bought a soft storage tackle boxes 2 years ago, you just switch between the smaller stowaway boxes, according to the fishing you'll be doing. Works well except you just get more of the stowaways and keep filling them. Some of my stowaways look like there displays. So I know where your coming from. Good luck to ya, looking forward to your reports."
77570,lew,2007-05-31 14:05:00,12767,"Jeeez, I'm just getting all my musky gear together in the basement for this weekends opening and the pile seems to grow every year, even though I tell myself every year that I don't need anything else, yet I continue to buy  I gave away, plus sold  a bunch of stuff this year, yet I still seem to have more.  This doesn't even count the 80 odd bucktails that spend the winter in the boat, or all the stuff stored at the trailer.....good thing I own a Safari van.  Good luck to all youz other musky guys hitting the water this weekend.  "
77573,Puckhead,2007-05-31 14:08:00,377,Holy cr@p Lew!  Any room left for you on the boat?
77575,Guest mistyriver1,2007-05-31 14:09:00,0,"Good stuff Lew.  I see the new ""Boo Box"" is ready for action."
77576,Terry,2007-05-31 14:16:00,14456,boys and their toys you can never have too much tackle........
77577,Whopper,2007-05-31 14:23:00,2174,"Good Luck Lew and everyone else chasing the toothy critters.  Just got unpacked and started two piles, USED (needed) & UNUSED (don't pack no more) took some notes for future trips.  Whopper"
77589,irishfield,2007-05-31 14:52:00,26272,  I've got that problem already...and haven't been at it for a 1/15th as long as you Lew! LOL
77590,fishdawg,2007-05-31 14:57:00,912,enjoy Lew - i wish you an safe enjoyable season i'll keep an eye out for you
77593,Tybo,2007-05-31 15:00:00,1373,"I'll take those plows and the 10"" believer off your hands"
77594,misfish,2007-05-31 15:01:00,29133,"Oh yeah,want to see all the bass stuff I got. L M A O  Lew I have been in yer boat,lets just say,I was thankful you cleaned off the back casting deck.  May you catch many toothy critters this year.   BTW You need a carpenter to fix those drawers? LOL"
77597,mattyk,2007-05-31 15:10:00,2110,have a safe and fun musky season!
77611,lew,2007-05-31 15:44:00,12767," Actually Paul, that's a 14"" Believer and you can take it off my hands for $40  As for the Plows, I'll sacrifice them to you for $80 a piece  Sometimes I'm sooooooo envious of bass fishermen and their $6 baits"
77613,BFSC Kevin,2007-05-31 15:49:00,1351,"as a musky newb.. YEESH.. 14"" Believer.. I have never thrown anything that is over 6"".."
77614,lew,2007-05-31 15:49:00,12767, You know your always welcome to join me Brian and you know where the boat is......just gimme a call anytime.
77617,Raf,2007-05-31 15:52:00,3495,"good luck this wknd and season Lew.  I know all about this 'disease' too.  Funny thing is I can justify each purchase in my mind, but the girlfriend doesn't always get it."
77621,misfish,2007-05-31 16:04:00,29133," Hey they all arent 6 bucks,sometimes we pay 7 or 8 bucks.LOL   Im sure I,ll be up there this summer Lew.The wife has some working weekend this year so I might as well go fishing.LOL"
77624,charlesn,2007-05-31 16:11:00,551,"Lew,  $6 baits...  Maybe for some of them, but even for those, we need like 6 of each colour due to those pesky toothy critters of yours.  We also need about 30 rods and reels each for various applications.  There may be a more expensive fish to chase after, but the bass is certainly up there in terms of costs...  Losing something like a Megabass Vision 110 ($30 USD apiece) to a slimer is about enough to make a grown man cry.  Not because of the cost, but because of how hard they are to find up here.  Talked to a bassin' friend and his bait count was at 58 plano 3700 trays full.  Yup, FIFTY EIGHT!!!  That does not count the unopened stuff on pegboard.  lol, rather ridiculous and nuts and he's sorta reserved compared to some other friends.  Luckily I have much more self control than they do so I'm well under the 50 Plano tray mark if you don't count spinnerbait, buzzbait, flippin jig, tube and crankbait trays...  And I don't have a pegboard wall either.  Also if the wife ever complains, I just show her a photo of JP's tackle warehouse/room.  Sometimes the junk/tackle collection is half the fun.  Giving stuff away always feels good too.  Charles"
77626,jediangler,2007-05-31 16:14:00,1923,"You need to buy a kayak for musky fishing Lew. Then you only have room for half a dozen baits. Over the years I've fished with fewer baits every year. Moving more and more of them to take up permanent residence at home. This Saturday I'm taking one plano with 4 bucktails, 2 slopmasters and 2 cobra jigs with rubber on them. I have to save room in the kayak for lunch and drinks as well as my camera and tools for unhooking. Good luck to all."
77627,Puckhead,2007-05-31 16:15:00,377,58 trays full?  WOW>>>>>>>>>>>>
77629,lew,2007-05-31 16:18:00,12767,"Yeah, I know what your sayin Charles, were all addicted to fishin stuff. I've probably got 100 minnow baits for pickeral......and I fish for pickeral exactly 3 days a year.  Oh well, I spose we could all spend our money foolishly on less fun things"
77630,John,2007-05-31 16:22:00,2956,"Lew, have a wonderful weekend and a very fruitful season.  John"
77631,lew,2007-05-31 16:25:00,12767,"Thanks John and the very same to you, see you in a couple weeks."
77636,bigbuck,2007-05-31 16:40:00,2449,"Jeez Lew-eeze!!! Lew, that's a whole whack of stuff, how big did you say your boat was?? I guess you used to be a boy scout (be prepared). Good luck this season and I hope you absolutely slay the toothy critters."
77638,Bernie,2007-05-31 16:41:00,3190,"Take up pickerel fishing Lew. All you need is a couple jigs, one fishing rod and a box of worms."
77642,ecmilley,2007-05-31 16:45:00,2163,lew any musky gear you would like to give away i am sure i could find it a good home and have a great opening I'll be out on Sturgeon Sunday morning
77663,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-31 17:22:00,0,  From what I hear...It only gets worse as ya get older....lol. Its one addiction that Im not to clear on really but its ok. I can quit tomorrow~
