78304,Nanook,2007-06-01 23:54:00,565,"I heard, last week that all boats are required to have Compass on board. After digging around and putting in a few 'phone calls, I got this;  All vessels under 6m and out of sight of navigation aids must be equipt with a Compass.  Anyone seen this in print. ???"
78306,boatman,2007-06-01 23:57:00,350,"No, but I'm not going to have my 14 footer that far from shore."
78308,Nanook,2007-06-02 00:06:00,565,  I'm with you  Boatman!!
78311,Terry,2007-06-02 00:14:00,14456,only I have read  Power-driven pleasure craft greater than 8 m (26’3”) in length require a properly adjusted compass. If the voyage is more than 20 nautical miles (37 km) from shore a compass bearing device is required.
78411,POLLIWOGG,2007-06-02 15:07:00,835,"Page 10 of your safe boating guide.  Required if you are more than 20 miles out.  If you are using oars  you are exempt, I guess its OK to be lost as long as you do it slowly.  You are also exempt if you are within sight of navigational marks as long as you can determine a relative position."
78442,irishfield,2007-06-02 17:45:00,26272,For what they cost why wouldn't you have one anyhow? Tinny...in your pocket/tackle box in case the fog rolls in. Console...on the dash...    Just another hole I drilled in the bugger to make me feel better.....
78516,Terry,2007-06-03 00:23:00,14456,"well my GPS has a compass, so I'm good to go......"
78518,irishfield,2007-06-03 00:31:00,26272,'till the battery dies...gremlins arrive...
78530,bigfish1965,2007-06-03 01:08:00,3382,For five bucks you can get one at Canadian Tire. Very good insurance in case of emergency. If nothing else it will stop you from going in circles if caught out in the fog.
