Got a couple of little ones - 1-2 lbs - but first was a large one, 10 lbs+, which almost pulled my rod in the river - tight drag reasons  .  Without my buddy's help, I wouldn't have managed to land the ""monster"" so it'll be him posing for the kudos.    Later on the heat set in, and very little action whatsoever, so before 10:30 am we were back.      This time I'll try to eat my catch.  Have good weekend, everyone! Danubian "

78443,bassmaster4,2007-06-02 17:46:00,801,"nice fish, i dont think carp are very good eating fish lots of bones i think"
78448,glirw,2007-06-02 18:25:00,200,Report back on how they taste ! The little one will probably taste much better . What out for the nasty bones !
78454,PatrickGG,2007-06-02 20:42:00,562,Do you guys eat the eyes on them also?
78465,L.T.Stone,2007-06-02 21:54:00,3,"Wow, big fish, I bet it put up a great fight! What kind of line did you use? I took my daughter trout fishing with me the other day and she thought she had as snag but it ended up being a carp"
78531,Danubian,2007-06-03 01:12:00,65,"I just filet it, and there weren't that many bones. It tasted not that great. Indeed the smaller ones taste better (1lb..6lb); I ate them before.  Anyway, the fight was much higher enjoyed than the taste.  Line: I think it was a 10lb or 12lb line -the gear wasn't mine, my buddy's- and the fish put up a lot of fight, with splashes and all. Once hooked, they usually head in for cover - like dive in, or get in grassy areas - but for this one it wasn't any close by grassy patch, the water was shallow, so basically it was: give'm line, reel it back in, give'm line, reel it back, again and again until I managed to bring it close to shore where my buddy netted him. My only concern was to not get spooled, particularly that I didn't know exactly how much line I started with.  On a brute force confrontation, even with a stronger line, such a ""beast"" may win up breaking your rod or snapping the line."
