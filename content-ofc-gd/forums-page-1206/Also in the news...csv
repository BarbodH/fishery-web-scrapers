Some days I get no 'SPAM,' others as many as 20 messages wanting my banking info, so 'an error can be corrected,' or 'a new account has been set up for me,' even some concerning 'more info needed to keep my E-Bay, or 'PayPal' account current? I've never had accounts with either. Then of course there's the Viagara & Cialis 'deals,' too. Half of these come-ons have glaring spelling errors (didn't Nigerian schools teach spelling?) . . . . it would be nice to make all this crap illegal. With our 'junk mail' at the Post office, all you have to do is place a sign with minimum 1"" lettering that you don't wish to have 'unsolicited mail' (third class unaddressed) delivered, and you get no more. Most of the 3rd class addressed (""YOU HAVE JUST WON . . . ."") can be stopped by going to the Canadian Direct Marketing Association, and filling out a simple form . . . that will cut out 90% of the other solicitations. too bad Internet crap isn't that easy to get rid of!"
