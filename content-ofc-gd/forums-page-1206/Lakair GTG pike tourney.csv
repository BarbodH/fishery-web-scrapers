78240,Rizzo,2007-06-01 20:49:00,4754,"...just try to stay in your boat this time Spiel.  Its all we, or the poor fish that have to live in that water, can ask."
78278,crappiesteve,2007-06-01 22:43:00,220,"I,m with you on that one,I,ve heard of Chris,the way he runs a boat.  Chris,I,m LOL Bud.  Steve"
78286,irishfield,2007-06-01 22:52:00,26272,He runs them just fine Steve....just has some issues tying them up is all.....
78298,tjsa,2007-06-01 23:23:00,1578,"You guys actually fish for them, for points, or prizes???????????   WHAT FER???????   We just hit 'em over da 'ed with a piece of lumber and toss 'em bak,  Most of 'em recover.  JUST KIDDING!!!!!"
78334,Rich Clemens,2007-06-02 01:52:00,3131,"Sorry folks .. the pike tournament winner has just locked in. Good things come in threes they say.  1).  Won the Extreme Angler pack of goodies.  That's number 1. 2).  Received an E-mail today from Teresa that I had won a subscription to Esox Angler.   That's number 2. 3).  Next up, the Pike Tournament at Lakair.   That must be number 3 !  You may as well just sit back at the camp and put away a few cold ones.  (Watch you're shoes ... it's starting to get a bit deep now)."
78377,Roy,2007-06-02 10:10:00,13728,"Rich, you already have your three wins. As good as Esox Angler magazine is, you also got an email from Teresa! I wish you good luck in the tourney at Lakair and I'm looking forward to meeting you and a quite a few other new faces to the get together as well.  ps. Teresa likes bouquets of flowers...a bouquet of hops will put you in good stead with her."
75264,Daplumma,2007-05-26 00:30:00,1961,Do you have stuff that doesn't suit your fishing style but someone else could prolly use?Maybe a camp stove that you never used or a filet knife that you never used cause you dont eat fish(or catch fish)?Bring it up to the GTG no one walks away empty handed!What do y'all think?I saw a nice pair of snowshoes and a 10million candle power flashlight go pretty quick last year. Joe
75265,motv8tr,2007-05-26 00:33:00,2587,I think I might be able to scroung up an item or two...  Maureen
75266,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 00:33:00,8163,"I was thinkin' monetary contributions, because I plan on taking the cup this year!!!"
75267,irishfield,2007-05-26 00:35:00,26272,"Sounds VERY good Joe. I've got some XD-30 2 stroke oil, and some other things kicking around that may just grace that table. If not I'll buy something for it. I think everyone participating should put something on the table and relieve TJ from needing to add anything."
75273,Daplumma,2007-05-26 00:40:00,1961,"Dawg,If past performance is any indication of the future you wont have to worry bout changing that hoser dollar to usd this June! Joe"
75274,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 00:44:00,8163,"... but come to think of it... I do have a rusty ol' stringer I can't bring myself to throw away (it belonged to my Great-Grand-Niece... God Rest Her Husbands Soul!), a couple of Zebco rods with broken tips (they PAID me a DOLLAR to haul AWAY from a yard sale), and a Roland Martins Helicopter Lure Kit (as SEEN ON TV!!!... and great for twisting the line on your reel!!!) I could donate."
75285,Rich Clemens,2007-05-26 01:19:00,3131,"Being my first time coming, what if I pick up a nice musky lure or something similar.  Would that be appropriate ?  Oh yeah ... I may be coming up Sunday the 17th ... instead of Tueday the 19th."
75286,Daplumma,2007-05-26 01:22:00,1961,"That would work..Not a good idea to bring a handgun or moonshine,,err at least that is what I hear!!! Joe"
75287,Greencoachdog,2007-05-26 01:26:00,8163, Handguns ARE a NO-NO!!!

75830,Rizzo,2007-05-28 00:32:00,4754,"Hey Joey, how about that cooler you're sitting in?  Unfortunately I am about 95% certain I will not be at Lakair this year.  On the positive side, this means there is reason for people to fish the tourney, rather than watching the inevitable of having the trophy handed to me."
76068,BITEME,2007-05-28 14:19:00,1969,Hey Rizzo maybe you might want to consider 2008 seeing how im looking at a 2fer for this year
76102,Joey,2007-05-28 15:11:00,9122,"Sorry Rizzo, that cooler will be filled with all the monster fish I catch   , and other brown bottle type things  Joey"
76124,Rizzo,2007-05-28 15:39:00,4754,"Fill that cooler all you want, I guarantee Paul will have it emptied by Saturday afternoon"
76126,Joey,2007-05-28 15:42:00,9122, No doubt!!!
