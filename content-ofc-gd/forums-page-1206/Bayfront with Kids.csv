Easton, and my sister decided to join us, 5 children in total all had an excellent time. Although they are going to have to learn how to put worms on a hook they did a great job.         Finally we ran out of bait and it was time to come home...All and all an amazing night out with the family."

77906,Jen,2007-06-01 03:00:00,833,"  We caught them Mike, perch mostly and just let the kids reel them in when they were not busy with their own.  Kept everyone very very busy ... and happy of course."

Although I've heard of that spot and its abundance of carp, I've never been there . . . .      is there lotsa parking? How far to carry about 60 pounds of gear? I'm toyin' with the idea of hitting the spot you visited Saturday, today? Ah h h h  .  .   .      so many places . . .     so little time!"
77971,ccmtcanada,2007-06-01 12:14:00,7971,Great report Jen!  I love reading these family reports...getting the younger generation into the sport is a great way to spend time with them.  Kids always seem to have fun fishing!
78012,Hooked,2007-06-01 13:16:00,891," If I'm not mistaken Photoz, I believe Bob Izumi filmed a carp show there a few years ago.  Theres lots of parking available there, and you definately want to bring some sort cart with you, because there is some walking involved, alot depending where you want to go.  Give er a go.  Almost forgot to mention, nice report Jen."
78056,kennyman,2007-06-01 14:22:00,737,"Looks like everyone had a great time. I'm trying to instill a love of the outdoors,water, camping,canoeing, fishing etc. in my children too. It's something we can all do as a family and I believe it'll make them grow into better, more responsible people. I hope they pass it onto their kids too."
78061,easton13th,2007-06-01 14:28:00,371,"It was a great time, weather was fantastic for such a night. All the kids had a great time. It was interesting to see 6 kids try to figure out how to put a worm on a hook without touching it. Worms don't HOLD ON to the hook.  Photoz the carp were there for sure, we seen them moving threw from time to time. There was one gentleman carping closer to shore. Not sure but I don't recall him catching anything.  Another fantastic time spent with family.  Easton"
