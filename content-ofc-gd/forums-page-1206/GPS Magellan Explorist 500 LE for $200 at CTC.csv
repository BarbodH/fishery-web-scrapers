The latest version of their ""direct route"" (mapping) software was about $180 CDN, download from their website.  The latest version of the lake software for the Kawatrhas area was about $160, so you are looking at some additional costs.  It is virtually useless as-is out of the box with the base map included, but then again I wanted to use it for driving directions and with the lake map.  You will also need to buy at least a 1GB Sandisk SD card.  Some of the other brands apparently aren't recognized by the unit.  The LE model does not include a Lithium Ion rechargeable battery.  It includes a battery pack that gets power from 3 AAA size batteries.  It also does not include a charging cable, other than the USB one, but that does not matter as there should be a mail-in form for a free one from Magellan.  I really lucked out and there was a Lithium Ion battery with mine.  I don't know why, as it says right in the box what is included and that was not listed.  You can order one from Magellan for about $30-$40, which I reccomend if you don't luck out like I did.  Having said all the above, I like the unit.  I like the colour screen and the menu set-up.  It has always worked and not let me down.  It picks up a signal fairly quickly and the map response is quick as well.  One thing I didn't like is the customer service.  Long story (nothing to do with the unit) but I hope you never have to call.  The battery life from the rechargeable definitely lasts for a day on the water or in the truck.  I don't know how long the battery pack (with AAA's) lasts as I have never used it.  Keep the back light on low, it eats the batteries quick.  Great, phenominal, deal IMO at $200, but at full price - not so much.  Just remember about the additinal maps costs."

78466,bbog,2007-06-02 21:58:00,665,Another vote for Garmin. Have a look at the eTrex series (CX version comes with expanded memory capability). These units run on the more common AA batteries. Check out RadioWorld for best prices.  Cheers.
