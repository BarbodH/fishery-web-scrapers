77607,Terry,2007-05-31 15:30:00,14456,"here are the maps  topo canada  then gpsquebec           think I will be buying some maps from gpsquebec they sent me the screen shot from the area I want to buy,,nice of them"
77616,douG,2007-05-31 15:51:00,2693,"Ahhh, DanC.  Now I see what you mean about these GPSQuebec maps.  They have much more detail.  Fiendishly expensive tho, especially compared to the TopoCanada I borrowed from a third party for a handshake and a smile."
77619,Terry,2007-05-31 15:59:00,14456,"yeah, 80 bucks for one region is a lot... but 300 for all of ontario isn't that bad......  maybe a few guys could go in together and get them"
77841,danc,2007-06-01 00:48:00,4677, Excellent idea Terry. That's how I got my maps.
77925,brkygetr,2007-06-01 03:53:00,425,"Hey Terry/Dan C...  Are those QuebecMaps compatible with Garmin products, I like also like the detail, and how big is a region or map area??? for example how far does that Shining Tree map cover?  thanks Brkygetr"
77926,danc,2007-06-01 04:06:00,4677,"If you buy the cd, it automatically installs itself in MapSource. I have the entire province loaded on my Garmin on a 1 gig card. Nice, nice maps wherever you travel in the province."
77954,Deano,2007-06-01 11:41:00,767,"I tend to believe mapsources version of the 560, although I haven't been there. The other looks way to smooth for a road up that way. I've been using mapsource for a while now and for the most part it's really good, only newer roads are not updated, but for trails, it's pretty good. Also does it autoroute?, really like the autorouting in mapsource. It is expensive though, considering TopoCanada is under $200 and you get all of Canada"
78141,Terry,2007-06-01 16:41:00,14456,interesting       so I got my gps track points to see which was right...looks like GPSquecbec is closer to what is right    the road was moved and paved about 6 years ago  topo canada has yet to update it
78147,Deano,2007-06-01 16:56:00,767,"Yes I agree then, it does look more acurate.  My, you shot up and down that lake a lot. Terry. LOL  With Canada maps going free, hopefully we'll see more acurate maps and better prices also. For now, I'll stick to mapsource. Came in handy when I was out in B.C."
