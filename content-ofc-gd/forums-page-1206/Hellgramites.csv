77731,Cowman,2007-05-31 20:01:00,18,"Hey guys  Just wondering if anyone has tried these before? I heard they're popular up in the Kawartha Lakes. Hellgramites (dobson flies)  How do they work, and is it only Bass that hit them? thanks alot!  "
77746,mason05,2007-05-31 20:29:00,258,Excellent bait for specks.  Best presentation is to tie them to a tiny hook with super fine line.  Corn Nug
77757,Woodsman,2007-05-31 20:50:00,1286,As said earlier small trout love them. Also great for sunfish.
77766,Roy,2007-05-31 21:29:00,13728,I used to fish them quite a lot on the Otonabee. They were the bait of choice for bass. That was many many years ago. I seem to remember having read something lately about them being illegal as bait. You might want to check in to that.
77772,ilario,2007-05-31 21:49:00,166,eww! i can't imagine tring to tie one of those nasty's on a tiny hook...they bite hard!
77793,BabyHerc,2007-05-31 22:39:00,285,"If they are in fact legal, does anyone know where they can be purchased?"
77812,Cowman,2007-05-31 23:25:00,18,"When I was at the kawartha lakes last may for the walleye opener i was talking to a girl that worked in the bait shop in buckhorn, you can only purchase them in like july august, yea she warned me about not getting bit my them and before i go up to muskoka for labour day ill be sure to check into it  thanks a lot guys"
77862,luv2drift,2007-06-01 01:12:00,147,I used them one day for perch on simcoe through the ice and it was a non stop feeding frenzy.  they are just a pain to hook.
77868,Fisherman,2007-06-01 01:24:00,7201,"I don't know if this would work, how about using spider thread to wrap them to a small hook.  Same stuff for making roebags."
77878,Joey,2007-06-01 01:48:00,9122,"I used them on trout in a river.  Turned over some rocks, gingerly put it on the hook and fish on first cast.  Kept doing it, kept catching.  They love em.  Ugly buggers tho.  Joey"
77903,oxcowboy,2007-06-01 02:48:00,544,great bait around here for bass and even catfish.  just hold them right behind their head and hook them there.  they have a way to teaching you to hold them correctly   it usually only takes one time of being careless.  what a pinch for such a small critter.
77916,DrPhil,2007-06-01 03:18:00,30,Great for walleye and bass.  Takes two to catch them.  One guy spreads a sein at the bottom of a riffle the other overturns rocks above the sein with his feet and the little buggers will be swept into the sein.  Best way to hook them is under the collar.  They are pretty much unhurt and will live for a long time.  They have a tendency to crawl under rocks or logs and will snag you up so it is best to keep them moving a bit to prevent snags.  I have caught rock bass without hooking the fish.  The hellgramite grabbing the fish with it's pincers and holding on.
77918,boatman,2007-06-01 03:33:00,350,"Fish don't love hellgramites. They actually hate them. They hate them with such a white hot intensity that they try to kill everyone they see. That's why they are such great bait. Fish will hit them out of spite instead of hunger.  I use a Rebel Hellgramite for browns with great success. When I've used live ones for bass, I hook them through the tail like you would crayfish. Fish them like a live crayfish and don't be afraid to fish weeds. I haven't heard of them being illegal, but I can see why they would be."
77980,pikehunter,2007-06-01 12:26:00,1659,"OK then I read through all the replies and no one has said what the hell a hellgramite is so I had to Google it. Hellgramite  I agree, they look nasty!"
78038,wask,2007-06-01 14:01:00,174,"   They are a real small mouth bait of choice in the river.  You are right though, they don't want to eat them, they just want to kill them."
78090,Cowman,2007-06-01 15:03:00,18,"Awesome guys, might grab a bunch when there in season if they're legal!, does anyone know of any bait shops that sell these in the lake muskoka area?? and its there jigs that resemble these also?"
78099,wask,2007-06-01 15:13:00,174,"My understanding is that Rebel makes one that I woudl assume is still in production that is like a crankbait.  Otherwise, there are soft plastics available for jigging I have seen online.  Its not made anymore, but the company that Made Al's Goldfish made a metal spoon with red eyes in Helgrammite shape called Al's Helgy as I recall.  I have one somewhere I am going to tie on this weekend..."
78150,kemper,2007-06-01 17:02:00,2232,I got hosed into buying those things on buckhorn one year. WAY to expensive and all they managed to do was attract every damn sunfish for 40 miles around.
78204,mpo,2007-06-01 19:33:00,6,"We used them for trout ......go to a swamp and scoop the mud up on the bank, when the water drains off they start to come out of the mud."
78220,swahrer,2007-06-01 19:54:00,28,I am sure you can get some imitation Fly's that won't bite you back!
