77819,lookinforwalleye,2007-05-31 23:46:00,4399,  Can`t argue that it`s his picture!
77907,wolfville,2007-06-01 03:01:00,396," Couldn't have said it better myself. I mean, you don't have to like every post you read here, and you don't have to complain about everything you don't like here."
77913,ccmtcanada,2007-06-01 03:16:00,7971,That's why I fish at night...no background to blur out....LOL
77929,selcram,2007-06-01 04:33:00,26,"Congratulations on the great catches!  Kudos to you for wanting to keep your fishing spot private. There are so few areas in the urban center that can be fished without crowds.  Look at how the Toronto Islands have exploded in recent years....now you see pictures of people shoulder to shoulder at the shore.  When I was in my teens, I frequented Frenchman's Bay in Pickering, which was great for Brownheads, carp and the occasional Pike. As soon as the word got out, people came in droves. After two years.. you could barely catch a catfish. The garbage and empty worm containers were another issue all together. Disgusting."

77421,snag,2007-05-31 03:14:00,1932,"Nice one!  Great post!  Not a carp guy myself,(I think they should be culled by the thousands) but there are definately choice spots for better-than-average carp.  Good to preserve spots and share with friends. (but maybe humanely kill the odd one)  This is another successful example where 2 members felt comfortable to share spots.   DSN is holding the fish.  Stop harrasing Alex.   The mystery of the spot is the alure."
