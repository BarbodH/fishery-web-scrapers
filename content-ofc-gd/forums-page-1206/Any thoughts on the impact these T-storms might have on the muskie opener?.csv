Given all the bad weather in the Kawartha Lakes area yesterday and possibly today, do all the gurus on here have any reassuring words?"
77960,lew,2007-06-01 11:57:00,12767,Here's my outlook on post-thunderstorm days......hop in yer boat and go fishing and don't think about the weather.  Absolutely guaranteed 100% you won't catch a musky from your living room.

77981,Jer,2007-06-01 12:28:00,1426,"The storms missed us here on Upper Buckhorn as well...  My buddy and I were on my dock and watched the blackness pass by to the south, it got really windy for a bit, the temp dropped at least 5 degrees, lotsa rumbling thunder...and then it was gone...not a drop of rain.  Was a beautiful evening for fishing (even though we only managed 2 small pickerel amongst a bunch of small crappie)."
78011,kelvarnson,2007-06-01 13:11:00,15,Thanks guys.  Anybody know if the storms hit on or near Rice Lake? That's where I'm heading tomorrow...
78021,Jer,2007-06-01 13:29:00,1426,"Peterborough got hit...but my girlfriend said there was nothing in Port Hope or Cobourg, so your guess is as good as mine.  Probably doesn't matter anyway...today is a carbon-copy of yesterday. Every chance of severe storms again this afternoon...where they hit nobody knows."
78033,ecmilley,2007-06-01 13:52:00,2163,the only change I'll be making is to put my camera in a zip lock bag otherwise i'll be fishin as normal
