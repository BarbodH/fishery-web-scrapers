77823,Clampet,2007-06-01 00:11:00,1947,"Just wonderin' about this part..  ""For their study, the researchers grew a 4µm-thick p-GaN epilayer via hydride vapor-phase epitaxy on a c-plane sapphire substrate (Mg was the p-type dopant (hole concentration = 2.5 x 10[18] cm[3]), onto which was first deposited a 65nm thick SiO2 layer using PECVD, then a Ti/Al/Ti layer (thicknesses 30-100-30nm) using e-beam evaporation. Photolithography and wet etching yielded 300µm-dia circular, insulated metal contact pads with 500µm pitch on the surface of the p-GaN epilayer. A suspension of GaN nanowires in isopropanol was then dispersed onto the substrate with the insulated metal contact pads; the nanowires were aligned dielectrophoretically by applying a 10 V peak to peak, 1 kHz sinusoidal voltage to one post."""
77825,lew,2007-06-01 00:15:00,12767,"Yup, that's exactly the same way I do it........"
77828,keram,2007-06-01 00:26:00,585,"Yup, it is basic process, with time and some modyfications you can make it even better. But you have to hurry, Muskie opener is only 48+ hrs away."
77831,keram,2007-06-01 00:30:00,585,"One more thing. To achieve desired performance faster I like to use ethanol instead of isopropanol. Any leftovers won't be wasted.   Looks loke you were skipping school to much, it was in 4th grade"
77836,Fisherman,2007-06-01 00:42:00,7201,"Ya, like to see those guys try to get a minnow on the hook, that ought to be interesting...."
77838,Terry,2007-06-01 00:43:00,14456,so you could make a large scale led lighting system with very little voltage. very interesting is this theory or being done
77839,irishfield,2007-06-01 00:44:00,26272,Dang...where's douG when we need 'em ?
77840,Clampet,2007-06-01 00:45:00,1947, That thar is the science which will set the hook! 
77842,Greencoachdog,2007-06-01 00:49:00,8163,Lots to drink and real bored eh?
77850,Clampet,2007-06-01 01:00:00,1947," Well, after many hours spent behind the ceeement pond, Jethro and I with help from the U. of Maryland and Howard U., have devised a fabrication method that creates tiny ultraviolet light-emitting diodes from nanowires, and NIST says the technique is ""well-suited"" for scaling to commercial production. "
77941,Corey,2007-06-01 10:10:00,355,"Is it bad that I pretty much understand that? With the exception of some of the chemicals names, I know what they are trying to do.  Ethanol most likely will not work for that process like the isopropal will."
77945,aplumma,2007-06-01 10:30:00,6896,using chemicals and lazers to bond/etch is not a new process we have been doing this to computer chips for many years.   Art
77958,douG,2007-06-01 11:52:00,2693,Huh?
77991,tonyb,2007-06-01 12:38:00,1637,What the...
78127,cantermore,2007-06-01 15:55:00,49,is that the process they are lighting up the CN Tower with?  just to set up the gear needed to do all that production is about $ 4 billion fyi... R&D is a tad cheaper... someone has too much money here or access to a neat lab
