77963,ccmtcanada,2007-06-01 12:06:00,7971,"You are right...here's the info from the regs...  Who does NOT need to purchase a Fishing Licence? 1. Residents of Canada who are under 18 years of age or 65 years of age or older, and are in possession of their Birth Certificate. 2. Disabled Canadian residents, if they are eligible for and in possession of EITHER: • a Canadian National Institute for the Blind National Identity Card; OR • an Ontario Ministry of Transportation disabled person parking permit. 3. Canadian residents who are in possession of their Birth Certificate and who require the direct assistance of, and are accompanied by, another person to fish and to follow applicable fishing laws due to a condition of mental impairment or a developmental disability, a learning disability or dysfunction, or a mental disorder.  Those who qualify to fish without purchasing a fishing licence as indicated above, may fish with the same catch and possession limits as holders of a Resident Sport Fishing Licence tag. Additionally, they have the same responsibilities as those who have purchased an Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag and must abide by all regulations."

78320,irishfield,2007-06-02 00:42:00,26272,"I do as well...  Not a possibility anymore for the younger lads/lasses, as you can't plastic laminate them anymore. Thus good for nothing but drawer/safe storage."
