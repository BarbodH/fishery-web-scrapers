77959,Deano,2007-06-01 11:54:00,767,"Saw these things in my neighbors trees, flying around like hummingbirds, but more like bee's. Never saw them before and was wondering if anyone knows what they are. We were laughing and saying it was a humbug, hummingbird like a bug. "
77968,Deano,2007-06-01 12:12:00,767,"Well,  I searched around and found out it's a Hummingbird Clearwing Moth. A Daytime moth that commonly is mistaken for hummingbirds. Strange bug and they are pretty big, almost twice the size of those big bumble bee's. Learn something new everyday."

78003,Wes Bender,2007-06-01 13:01:00,105,Imagine catching that in the face flying down the 401 on a motor bike. OUCH!
78007,TJQ,2007-06-01 13:06:00,7806,I have several of them around our lilac trees as well.. this is the first year I have ever noticed them... very cool looking... it does certainly look like a baby hummingbird.

78009,skiel,2007-06-01 13:10:00,30,these thing's were always around when my dad had a bunch of 4 o'clock flowers planted on the side of the house. they are big.
78041,ilario,2007-06-01 14:04:00,166,i've seen those things a number of times in my yard over the years

Lew, i was looking at the old post (i think Gerrit posted a link) last week and went back to some of those (pics of the day) LOL I sure have a lot of pics since then, still like taking pics."
78048,easton13th,2007-06-01 14:11:00,371,"Never seen one before.  Scary looking things, glad they are daytime flyer's. I would not want one flying around me at the campfire!  Looks like might have teeth!  Easton"
