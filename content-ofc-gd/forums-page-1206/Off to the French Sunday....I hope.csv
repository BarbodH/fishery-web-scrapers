Saturday morning, 5 minutes into the mounting process and.....ping.....I pull a muscle in my back. No worry, just a little pain. Needed to go to hardwarefor a drill bit when pain REALLY kicks in......can hardly get back into car to go back to cabin. Spend next 4 days basically either in bed, or in a recliner. Forced to watch trout greadily slurping drakes below my deck......could hardly walk, much less wade. Finally able to drive home. Drving back up Saturday with my son and plan to leave for the French eraly Sunday AM. At least I think that's what I'm doing......back still hurts some, and trolling motor still needs to be mounted and wired. Wish me luck!!"
