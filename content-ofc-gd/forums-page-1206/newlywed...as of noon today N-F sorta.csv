(we buried her grandmother on Wed, so it's been an over the top stress filled week) .... and then we're off to Temagami (Jumping caribou) for 6 whole days of fishing fun (she picked it!!), some relaxing and a slower pace of life...  If anyone has any tips for either marriage or the temagami area (specifically jumping caribou or a small stream we can wet a line on... haven't been to the U.S. in a long time for my rainbow fishing and my local brookie spot hasn't sen me either) feel free to post it or PM me... so far my marriage advice consited of a phone call yesterday from my uncle saying ""you've got 28 1/2hrs to change your mind... 28 1/2hrs...."" *click* lol"

76224,douG,2007-05-28 19:39:00,2693,There are two rules for a successful marriage.  1).     Your wife is always right.  Always.  2).     Never forget rule #1.  Congratulations too.

""you're right, I'm wrong, sorry""  As told to me by my lawyer, who's wife was our office administrator(formerly called secretaries, lol).  All was good(or at least bearable) after those words were spoken, for at least 24 hrs.  Don't absolutely quote me on this, never been married myself,...............ummm.........fortunately???????"
