The annual Quebec Fishiing trip is scheduled to begin this Friday night at 12AM!  12 Hr drive to Belle Provence! (SP??)  We will be there for the week!  We have had a tough time with the Walleye in recent years, we typically jig plastiics or troll.  Has anyone come across some new rigs that have been working lately?  I will be sure to get a report together for your ""VIEWING"" Enjoyment once we return.  FISH ON!!  Couple video links from past trips below!    "
