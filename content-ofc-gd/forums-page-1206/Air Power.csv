77995,skiel,2007-06-01 12:47:00,30,I saw that on a cable channel once. cant remember which one. Looked pretty cool. I think they were testing in Asia on Fork lift's in busy market areas to cut down on emmisions in enclosed area's. I think this is the one I saw..  http://www.theaircar.com/  Not to hijack the thread but.... I also was just talking to a guy that said if you put acetone into your gas you pick up about 15%  to 20% increase in gas mileage.... VERY SMALL AMOUNT. something like 1 or 2 oz per 10 gallons. it works as a wetting agent and lets your gas vaporize better and hence is more efficient use of your gas.
