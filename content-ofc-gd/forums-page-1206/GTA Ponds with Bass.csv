77652,fishinggeek,2007-05-31 17:01:00,325,A while ago someone started their own board about GTA pond bassing.  Anyone have the link still?  I can't seem to find it.
77693,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-31 18:44:00,2585,i remenber that guy!  i think he got booted for asking the same question over and over again.
77702,snag,2007-05-31 19:04:00,1932,"Here it is: www.Ididn'tknowwhentoshut-up.com   If the link doesn't work just keep an eye open if you own a pool, they may be fishing it!  Actually, I'd love to know how they are doing!"
77720,dsn,2007-05-31 19:51:00,1018, Thats a good one. Snag
77827,Rizzo,2007-06-01 00:25:00,4754, oh man I had totally forgotten about that.  I do remember that my suggested bait every time the question was raised was HOT DOGS...and I stand by that.  Nothing beats a big honkin frank with a treble through it for GTA bass.
77911,mikeymikey,2007-06-01 03:13:00,376,"Hmm...  I don't know anything, so don't ask me."
77912,ccmtcanada,2007-06-01 03:15:00,7971,"I remember a pond messageboard that was posted on here...when I went there, there was a public board...with no info...but IF you got to the inner circle or something you had access to all the ponds with what was in them."
77949,Crazyhook,2007-06-01 11:19:00,1154,welcome back to OFC!
78036,RobHall,2007-06-01 13:57:00,261,"If all else fails....print this out and have fun fishing for bass, when the season opens.  Lots of bass ponds listed.  FOTB "
78138,Jon,2007-06-01 16:40:00,209,I think this is the link:  http://ontariofish.proboards84.com/index.cgi?board=general  Not very active.   Jon
78193,fishinggeek,2007-06-01 19:04:00,325,"Thanks for all the help!  Though I know many didn't appreciate his posts here, I have to give him props for coming up with some crazy spots to fish."
78198,snag,2007-06-01 19:27:00,1932,"Drool,  Look at this prospective bassin' hole!        "
78201,snag,2007-06-01 19:29:00,1932,You might find carp here  
78205,highdrifter,2007-06-01 19:33:00,2534, And peeving the locals right off with his spieling antics... yeeesh
78211,highdrifter,2007-06-01 19:43:00,2534," MUAH!!  Good one budday.  Actually, that wouldn't be too far off for some of the pools around these parts.   Fooeeeh, bass tend to like the dirtier, smellier spots anway.  The more floating turds the better!! gnawww"
