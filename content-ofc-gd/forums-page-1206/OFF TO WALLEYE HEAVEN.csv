78207,rickster,2007-06-01 19:38:00,495,Well off soon to the in laws again this weekend.  Going back to the rapids that we had such great walleye fishing on the long weekend.  Will be sure to bring the camera this time and take some pics of the scenery and hopefully of some nice walleyes.  Maybe can bump team nine up a bit. Report to follow on Monday to all of you that are going fishing this weekend Good Luck and be safe. And to those of you who are not. I am deeply deeply sorry.
