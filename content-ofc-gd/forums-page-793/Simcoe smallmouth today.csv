378591,Cudz,2009-08-31 22:25:00,2652,"Woke up at 3 am and was fishing by 4.  The night bite was not on at all but it felt like late Oct with the temperature hovering around 5 or 6 degrees.  Fish have moved already.  Had only 2 blowups.  Decided to try something else and moved to spot 2.  Managed a 3+pounder and then trolled with the dollarama outfit (could not cast it well but that is for another thread). Onto spot 3 nothing.  Now it is 11 am and I have 3 fish only and two of them are dinks.  Just when you think you have Simcoe figured out she throws a curve ball.  Onto spot 4.  Almost noon.  In a matter of 30 minutes I manage two fish over 4 pounds, a 2.5 pounder and lose 2 other pigs both around 4 pounds and one at the boat after a failed net job!  Should have stayed in bed until 10 am and gone directly to spot #4. haha.  Here are some pics that include 2 fat 4+ pound smallies (one is 4.40 pounds)    "
378592,misfish,2009-08-31 22:30:00,29133,  That aint going to work. I know them colors.LOL   Nice fish there bro.
378593,kickingfrog,2009-08-31 22:31:00,8333,Man! You are sure packing in the fishin' trips before going back to work aren't you?  Nice fish!
378597,Terry,2009-08-31 22:43:00,14456,man you're killing me I just haven't got out to fish for them yet.......  nice fish
378604,misfish,2009-08-31 23:03:00,29133,"  This weekend we should get out Terry. I think he,s hoarding my spots as of late."
378606,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 23:06:00,3761,"Great job dude! Now see that smallie beat's my PB SMB by .4lbs  We all excel at out favorite species of fish  Great job, would love to catch a nice 3lb smallie or so this fall!!   Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
378607,solopaddler,2009-08-31 23:06:00,8605,Beautiful fish! So what'd you get 'em on? Red Devil or 5 of Diamonds?
378608,Leecher,2009-08-31 23:13:00,7832,Man those are some beauties     Football size Great job Chris     Keep up the great work  I really thought you were going to say that you switch lures and give......  little...... well maybe you tried it and may be not  Again great job Chris on those hawgs!!! Leechman
378625,Pigeontroller,2009-08-31 23:49:00,2793,Nice ones...But are you perhaps trying to make them appear larger by the low camera angle...?
378629,ironstone74,2009-09-01 00:07:00,201,Nice fish man!  That's a good haul for an off day.  Paul
378646,Cudz,2009-09-01 00:39:00,2652,Not trying to do anything.  I fish the front of the boat on a platform and my buddy fishes the back and sits down. First fish 3.75 pounds Second fish 4.2 pounds Third fish 4.4 pounds fourth fish 2.57 pounds. You tell me.  Is that how big they look?
378649,Cudz,2009-09-01 00:43:00,2652,I tried it today.  At first it was runing on the side a bit but I just straightened the pull ring a bit and it ran true (i didn't change the lure at all just straightened the eye.)  I gave it a good shot and I will try it again soon.  The problem is that I tried it in a spot today that wasn't producing.  I will give it another shot very soon Jacques.  Tomorrow I am taking my kids out for a tube ride and I have a spot where I take them that I have a real shot at a fish.
378652,Cudz,2009-09-01 00:45:00,2652,You know I don't work Rob.
378657,Leecher,2009-09-01 01:01:00,7832," Right on Chris!!! Next time, try to slow down the retrieve.... I found by doing this it would go deeper and run smoother.  Will be keeping an eye out for your next report Jacques"
378665,Cudz,2009-09-01 01:13:00,2652,I was running it slow.  It was working fine in the end the problem was I was in almost 15ft of water and it couldn't get down.  I need to throw in about 6-10 ft.  Not my boat today but tomorrow I will take my boat.  I was actually impressed with the wiggle.  IT moved more than I thought it would.
378672,kickingfrog,2009-09-01 01:28:00,8333," Oh I know, I just wasn't sure if you knew."
378673,lpu_ofn,2009-09-01 01:31:00,29,Good job man! What type of lure do you use?   
378698,Joey,2009-09-01 02:28:00,9122,"Wow, those are monsters, way to go  Joey"
378701,Paully,2009-09-01 02:32:00,712,  Red Devil or 5 of Diamonds... I hear they kill it on simcoe...
378702,jaydub,2009-09-01 02:33:00,145,Those are some nice ones Cudz!  Were any caught on your Dollarama gear?
378717,Cudz,2009-09-01 03:01:00,2652,see dollarama post Jon. Did you get out today? 4.40 I laughed and so JT.  I guessed it was 4.6 as well but I was wrong.  JT fell in the water off the boat today as well. I will explain later.
378730,bigugli,2009-09-01 03:48:00,6138,"Had to go all the way to plan ""D""  to salvage the day eh?  At least you wound up with some fat smallies. Well done."
378785,Cudz,2009-09-01 13:07:00,2652,Both of those were not producing so went with a silver blue Northern King down 60 ft over 120 ft of water
378849,Slayingm,2009-09-01 16:45:00,204,Well done Cudz.... nice fish the frontal conditions the past few days.... they always bite... just got to figure out the depth and what to use.... Greg.
