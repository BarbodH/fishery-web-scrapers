I've been targeting chinook with the typical baits J-13 GFR, Buzz Bombs in various colors and Cleos in Blue/Silver, Green/silver, Green hammered gold, Glo- Orange, Glo-Green and haven't had any luck. Today I saw a number of pink salmon surfacing and swimming through the run i was fishing. Anyone willing to share some of their ""go to"" pink salmon lures? Thanks in advance."
