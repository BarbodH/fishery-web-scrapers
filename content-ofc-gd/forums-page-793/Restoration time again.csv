377995,Gerritt,2009-08-30 13:13:00,6129,They certainly are still in service! Lodges still use them all the time.. two come off the top of my head... Lakair and Welcome Lodge....
378033,Bernie,2009-08-30 14:46:00,3190,"Brian, the boats had a name plate on the dash board of the deck. The really old ones had a cast nameplate that I would love to find. I was hoping this one had one but unfortunately did not. Jocko, the boats are somewhat similar to the Peterboroughs in the fact they are both cedar strips. The Peterborough had rounded ribs and was a little more finely finished. But this also raised the price of them at the time and I believe with the arrival of aluminum boats it put them out of business. Our boats are more oriented towards camp use and are also built stronger because of that. They still remain very popular for use by the tourists at the camps. They are easier to handle in wind and waves and the wooden seats don't tend to get flaming hot in direct sun as aluminum can sometimes get."
378071,misfish,2009-08-30 16:44:00,29133,"Here it is Bernie. it,s 1950 era. Restoration has been started already on the outside as you can see. Not sure it,s one of yours.There was no name plate.  Think it might be a Jones?  Asking price with trailer,$3500.        "
378279,Bernie,2009-08-31 00:53:00,3190,Brian I am not sure who made that one. Several company's made cedar boats way back when and also lots of them were homemade. Looks to be in not too bad of shape although looks can be deceiving. A new one would be less than that $3500( minus the trailer).
378344,fishnsled,2009-08-31 03:23:00,3520,"Great find Bernie!  A sanding and lemon drop work day sounds great but do you really want that to happen Bernie??  JOE!! You are suppose to gently sand the entire area, not just the one spot that the sander went through.....  It's entirely up to you Bernie.   Looking forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks."
378355,Jonny,2009-08-31 04:37:00,1380," Thanks, Bernie. So I take it they are built along the same lines and would look somewhat similar to the untrained eye (like mine).  I saw a cedar strip a few weeks ago (cruising a few hundered yards from our shore) that looked to be in very nice shape but it was completely painted in a gray and white scheme with a name or logo painted in big letters along the side. Unfortunately I didn't get a picture of it. I enjoy seeing that kind of boat more than seeing fancy ""runabouts"", but spotting one is very rare.  Yes, from what I recall of my Grandpa's boat, these boats are great for choppy water because of their weight and their lines. They don't bounce or pound like a tin boat. They need a bigger motor to match the speed of an aluminum, but speed isn't everything, and in rough water you can actually travel faster with them.  Altogether a better boat for sea-handling qualities, but they require a lot more maintenance, I think. Would I be right in thinking that that's the main thing that puts people off them nowadays?"
378780,Headhunter,2009-09-01 12:59:00,5703,"You can't sand a boat with a lemon! Great find Bernie! She'll look great up beside your Dad's and Uncle's boat! Gerritt is correct... I recall fondly riding in a similar boat, in the 70's vacationing on the French with my family. It's look great when your done! HH"
378791,Bernie,2009-09-01 13:26:00,3190,"Joe, I borrowed a couple extra sanders and a handful of scrapers for next weekend. You may need to take the Monday off so we have time to fish."
378803,Headhunter,2009-09-01 13:57:00,5703,"Bernie, you sweet talker you! Heck, I'm sure I could try and find a way to take the whole week, ah, screw that, the whole month! HH"
377745,Bernie,2009-08-29 14:28:00,3190,"I have been looking for an old cedar boat made by my family for a while. Opportunity knocked and a very old one came my way. It's a 16ft Powassan special. Really, that's what it's called  . I talked to my uncle Pete yesterday who has a very good memory about most everything. I described the boat to him and he figures the boat is minimum 55 years old. The reason he knows this is that they stopped installing wood deck bands in 1955. The boat is in restorative condition and won't take a whole lot of repair, just lots of elbow grease. Next summer project. The bottom has been fiberglass coated at some time in it's life and doesn't allow a leak. The water in the boat is from sitting outside for a few weeks. I dug out a 5HP Viking I fixed up several years ago but never used it. It pushes it along but won't plane, so a larger HP will get put on next week. I would like to find a 1958 Johnson 10 or 15HP. I think it would suit the boat best. There may be one kicking around somewhere. Be a good one to troll out of and putt around with. The plastic seats will have to disappear.      "
377746,Twocoda,2009-08-29 14:37:00,4130,nice find ...good luck with this project....my uncle inlaw just hand built something very similar to this boat for shooting over to Chantry Island....his passion for it almost convinced me to do the same....( then my wife smacked me in the head and told me to finish the two projects i have on the go ...)
377754,Greencoachdog,2009-08-29 15:05:00,8163,I'm sure she'll be a beauty when you get her fixed up Bernie!!!
377756,Spiel,2009-08-29 15:11:00,9065,Neat project Bernie. Reminds of the rentals that we used to use on Lake Kipawa. When caught in the rain I used to bury myself up under the bow and let my friend drive back to camp.  Question: Do you you plan on removing the fibreglass?
377757,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-29 15:25:00,1362,That's a great looking boat Bernie!!....awesome find and I can hardly wait to see pics of it when you're done restoring it!
377766,danbo,2009-08-29 15:40:00,2646,Luv it!
377767,Billy Bob,2009-08-29 15:50:00,5865,Fixing up a old boat is a great idea but using OLD motors that pollute more then they push the boat is not IMOH
377779,bigfish1965,2009-08-29 16:52:00,3382," True, Billy, but when going for an authentic restoration, you have to try and go all the way. If you did the same to an old corvette, you wouldn't drop a 4 cylinder engine in it."
377781,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-29 16:58:00,0,gorgeous old boat.  there's a very old wood boat stored at my camp i've been eying up for a while!  i'd like to do soemthing similar with it!
377782,trapshooter,2009-08-29 17:00:00,1234,Sweet find Bernie.  Can't wait to see the end result of your restoration.
377829,Bernie,2009-08-29 20:30:00,3190,"Thanks for the comments guys.  Chris, the glass will stay, really tough to take it off if it was properly applied. Many of the boats back in that time had painted bottoms anyway so it isn't too much out of era. Besides that the soaking up period in the spring is a pain in the  Billy, some of the old engines were bad polluters but not all were poorly engineered in that manner. A big part of the pollution and oil slicks was the type and amount of oil added at that time. Modern quality 2 stroke oils have much better lubrication properties and are designed to burn away with the combustion process. The little engine I put on it is being run on 50/1 mix. No smoke or oil slicks were evident as it was being run but still has a slight familiar 2 stroke smell. I have run older models for several summers in the past at 50/1 without any lubrication failures. The larger engines that OMC produced (33hp and up) through the 1950's and 60's were notorious gas hogs and lots of hydrocarbons went out the exhaust unburned. Not sure of the Mercurys back then as there were not a lot of them around here at that time.  I may even start into sanding it down this fall if we ever get nice weather again."
377831,misfish,2009-08-29 20:33:00,29133,Nice project Bernie. Whats the name of the family again? Theres an old ceder for sale here that is for sale.
377864,Jonny,2009-08-29 23:26:00,1380,Great looking boat for its age. They need a lot of TLC but there's nothing quite like 'em.  I'd like to see how it looks when you get through restoring it.  My brother has a 1956  Evinrude Fast-twin (15 HP) that my Dad bought new in '56 and is still running and looks good. I don't know if he'd part with it though.
377869,backbay,2009-08-29 23:57:00,773,"Bernie, that boat looks to be really well constructed; good luck with the resto, I'm sure it'll look great!"
377877,Mike the Pike,2009-08-30 00:26:00,3421,Very nice can't wait to see the finished product.
377880,Leecher,2009-08-30 00:35:00,7832,Beauty Bernie I'm sure you'll fix her up real good Leechman
377882,Bernie,2009-08-30 00:41:00,3190,"Brian the boat was made by B Giesler & Sons in Powassan. Been building them since the 1920's and are still being built  today.  Jocko, thank you for the offer but I think there may be one kicking around at our shop. Just need to find one that runs."
377893,misfish,2009-08-30 01:23:00,29133," Bernie,is there a trade mark to look for on the boat?  I,ll be heading over there Sunday and take a pic of it. It,s bare bones.Just the wood."
377900,Jonny,2009-08-30 02:04:00,1380,"No problem, Bernie. If you had been interested I would have at least asked my brother, though I think he would probably want to hang on to it.  My father used to rent boats like this when I was a kid (before he built his own - not a cedar strip) and my grandfather had one for quite a few years, but I can't remember all that much about them, so this question might be dumb --- is the Giesler boat basically similar to a Peterborough boat?  I spent most of my life up around Timmins and the aluminum boat is king up there. I don't think I ever saw a cedar strip even once in all my years of fishing around Timmins.  I remember the solidity and good handling of these cedar strips, though. I've often had it in the back of my mind to want one."
377960,motv8tr,2009-08-30 09:07:00,2587,"Very nice Bernie, I know it's gonna look great when you're done!!  Maureen"
377971,Handlebarz,2009-08-30 11:57:00,3790,I love watching these projects come together nice find Bernie I cant wait to see her finished
377972,Gerritt,2009-08-30 11:57:00,6129,"Very nice B! You have been mentioning about doing this for a long time. Glad to see the dream come into reality!  You know if you need a hand, the boys will be there. drag it into the bunkie... we'll have a sanding/lemon drop party this winter!  Can't wait to see the final product.  See you in a couple weeks!  G"
377975,danbo,2009-08-30 12:22:00,2646,I wish I could afford one of those too! Now I see why those old motors had them funny colours! Very complimentry.  
377982,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-30 12:38:00,2585,i love the old wooden boats!!  that is going to be a real beauty when you get finished with her!!!  Cheers!!!
377994,Billy Bob,2009-08-30 13:11:00,5865,I haven't fished Lake Nippissing in about 30 years but when we did fish out of Sturgeon Falls all the rentals in that area were 18'ceder strip boats. Anyone know if any are still in service.
