378740,richyb,2009-09-01 10:05:00,774,i guess i need a smaller digital camera   ......   cool trick
378749,Fish Farmer,2009-09-01 12:02:00,2234,"Good idea, I think I would thread a peace of cord threw the hat and tie it around your neck. Just in case"
378860,Governator,2009-09-01 17:06:00,879,lmao brilliant..
378863,TC1OZ,2009-09-01 17:16:00,987,Works...or you could just pay a camera crew...that's what I do
378869,danbo,2009-09-01 17:37:00,2646,Too funny TC!
379014,Jonny,2009-09-02 03:42:00,1380,My wife thinks I'm enough of a techno-dork with some of the things I do. I'm going to have to pass on this one.
379015,irishfield,2009-09-02 03:46:00,26272,Hope it's a waterproof camera....and that's coming from a guy that dunked three of them in one year !
379016,Jonny,2009-09-02 03:53:00,1380,"I just had a thought...  If you used a Bob Dylan-type harmonica mount for your camera, you could mount it on your chest, fish hands-free, and maybe even see the view screen as you're recording.  It shouldn't be too hard to copy that kind of frame in heavy wire (coat-hanger?) and adapt it to hold a camera.  Your next project! "
379200,hoot33,2009-09-02 19:53:00,93,lol that might be an idea
