378851,Cudz,2009-09-01 16:47:00,2652,My hotmail is all reconfigured and it won't really let me get my mail.  Anyone else having issues at all?  Is there a fix?
378854,alphaalpha,2009-09-01 16:51:00,475,just checked mine...its working fine here.
378856,rbaquial,2009-09-01 16:54:00,968,Are you using Windows LIVE? or just regular hotmail? (via website)?  EDIT: I'm not having any problems.

MUCH better than Hotmail in EVERY respect, especially SPAM filters not to mention storage size.  Bob"
