379188,icefisherman,2009-09-02 19:16:00,952,"Started with a friend with lines down at 7:00am....by 7:20am we've had 6 fish in the live well.Quite a furry....then fish every 10-15 min...finished at 11:45am with 18 for 18, not a single fish lost today...all brought to the boat many released some kept for my friend's BBQ. Black/Purple did 60% of the damage with MJ the other 30% and watermelon remaining 10%. Best fishing was in 320 fow though we went all the way into the 375 fow. 40-65 feet down so fish did go a bit deeper then last week. 2.5 mph on the GPS. Size from few shakers to respectable 12-13 lbs. All bows and one Coho. First time out I didn't get a single Chinook...oh well....not complaining[]   A shot from the day:   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
