378594,KrUsTyX,2009-08-31 22:38:00,5,"Hey everybody, just found the website and theres a lot of good infos on it  I have few questions.  I will be close to Barrie and i am bringing all my fishing gear.  I wont have any boat since i am on a course but i would like to have few spots for offshore fishing.  I know theres some at Simcoe lake but i would like some precise informations since i don't really know the surroundings.  And from what i've read, nobody is fishing with top-water lures?  Frogs?  Poppers? Buzz Bait?  Not even in the little lake?  Cause here i am catching a lot of pike with top water lures (frogs especially).  I would like to catch a Bass since i've never caught any   Theres more trouts here than anything else!  Thank you for helping me  Marc"
378610,Leecher,2009-08-31 23:16:00,7832,Welcome to OFC Marc I'm not from that area and cannot help you with the info you need but I'm sure that someone will chime in.  Good luck with your bass hunt!!! Leechman
378618,misfish,2009-08-31 23:38:00,29133,"Off shore for top water on KBay is near none Marc.  Perch and  smallies here.  Theres a breakwall at the bottom of Batfield street. Good fishing there at times. Also the fountian can produce some big perch,smallies and pike. The odd eye has been taken there at times aswell.  If you want to try your hand for some river salmon,they have started to come up in Angus. Hot shotting a wiggler in the silver color, works best for me. Also casting a #1 vibrafox in silver works too. Just have plenty on hand due to snags.LOL  You will need a lic to fish the part in town. Maybe pm fisherman where to buy it.   If you would like more detail on the wheres,feel free to pm me.   Welcome. Brian"
