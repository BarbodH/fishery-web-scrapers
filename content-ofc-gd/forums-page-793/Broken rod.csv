378632,curlrap,2009-09-01 00:10:00,58,"I recently broke my Shimano compre baitcaster rod while fishing. I purchased it at Walmart, but i don't have my receipt anymore. The rod has a lifetime warranty, can i ship it back to Shimano?"
378634,misfish,2009-09-01 00:13:00,29133,Walmart should do an exchange.
378640,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-01 00:18:00,2038,Ship it back to Shimano ......I believe a reciept is not required.........
378710,Joey,2009-09-01 02:44:00,9122,"Call A. Aikmans.  I just had two rods replaced.  He'll order the one you broke if he does not have it in stock.  No questions asked, no receipt required.  Joey"
378738,fishinguypat,2009-09-01 07:05:00,547,if you have to argue all you need is the liftime guarentee signature on the rod ..they have to take it back...if they still don't i suggest writing how it happened
378743,BITEME,2009-09-01 11:18:00,1968,walmart will exchange it trust me even without a reciept you might have to argue for awhile but they will cave
378751,bassman87,2009-09-01 12:08:00,586,"Wal-Mart sells Compres? Lol, next we'll see Loomis rods there."
378773,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-01 12:50:00,947, I was gonna say the same thing you remember how much you paid for a compre at wal-Mart?
378776,Dara,2009-09-01 12:56:00,3052,How do you people manage to break all these rods? There must be some awfully big fish out there that I don't know about
378778,Roy,2009-09-01 12:58:00,13728," Believe me, they are BIG! About the size of a trunk lid I'd say."
378784,holdfast,2009-09-01 13:05:00,1813,"No, just bend the tip on some of these rods that they sell now a days, especially the Shimano rods.  You will be surprised how easy they snap.  But I really like their reels if you think I have a hatred for Shimano"
378797,curlrap,2009-09-01 13:39:00,58,"I broke the rod casting a jerkbait, i could feel something was wrong before it broke. It snaped about 2 feet above the butt. I did catch a 30 pound muskie in the spring wiht it. And yes they sell Compre`s at Walmart, paid 99$ plus tax."
378996,fish-miester,2009-09-02 02:58:00,864,was wondering the same thing .. i was given a compre and new they had life time warranties .. and always wondered what to do if it broke?
379021,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-02 04:02:00,1107,"  High quality thin wall blanks will break fairly easily its the price you pay for light weight rods ask your local tackle shop how many rods they warranty a month I've destroyed 2 this year and 2 last year and they always seem to break on small fish for me and I use high end gear. Gloomis ,quantum and shimano and they all break but I have a $25 ugly stick that's been closed in a door that's still got the origanal tip on it but it weighs a tonne and has the feel of a willow branch."
379041,sconceptor,2009-09-02 11:43:00,146,"Walmart in North Bay carries a lot of cool stuff, Clarus rods, Curado reels, musky series rods, musky tackle, and some neat walleye worm harness."
379043,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-02 11:49:00,1022,"After breaking a compre and avid, before purchasing my next rod (I only buy lifetime warranty from now on) I always ask, ""if I break this can you replace it here""? If they say no, I carry on and look for another store that does, even if it costs more. I payed $40 to ship my avid to Wisconsin, or wherever their headquarters is."
