378826,Roy,2009-09-01 15:07:00,13728,"Get yourself a copy of John Alden Knight's Original ""Solunar Tables"" and also get ""Moon up, moon down"" by the same author. He is the authority.  edited to add: If you can't find them locally, you can order them through Rollie and Helen's Musky Shop."
378828,cranks bait,2009-09-01 15:13:00,721,I plan my trips on whenever I can go.  I don't go much by the lunar.  Although when I am out night fishing it is nice to have the extra light to be able to see the dingy's and jet ski's running full out with no lights on.
378829,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-01 15:18:00,135,I'm going fishing this weekend and I just happened to notice it will be a full moon on the 4th.  Apparently fishing improves 3 days before and after a full or new moon.  Does it actually increase my odds of having a great fishing day?  Or is it just a myth?

378859,bigugli,2009-09-01 17:03:00,6138,"Moon phases play there part, but so do high and low pressure cells and approaching weather fronts. I don't rely on just the one source of info."

I'll also be on the water for moonrise and set, if possible. As others have said though, it's only one factor. The weather plays a bigger role, IMO."
