374452,johnnyb,2009-08-20 12:30:00,3413,"My avatar is my current pb Pike...37 inches from a back lake in the Temagami region...came from the first day I ever sight fished for them...very cool.  Favourite pike lure is still a #5 or 7 Mepps aglia, and occasionally I'll toss bigger stuff, like buchertails.  Also have a nice big green inline spinner with willow leaf blades that I put a white grub on...seems to work quite well. The sight fishing was totally different though...tossing minnow baits and just twitching them on bottom until the fish came over and grabbed 'em.  Oh, and my set-up is a 7 (maybe 7'6) MH Bass Pro shops rod, with a Shimano Corsair spooled with 65 lb. Power Pro."

374507,pike slayer,2009-08-20 15:02:00,1177,jocko that looks like a pic from the 80s haha!
374536,PikeMolester,2009-08-20 16:20:00,428,im pretty sure it is.
374561,Jonny,2009-08-20 17:02:00,1380," And your point is....?  Actually no, it's not that far back. Good memories, though. We used to have a crew of guys (8-12) from our gun club who rented a cottage for an ice-fishing weekend every winter and we had some dandy catches. This was one of the biggest.  I'm wondering what you keyed in on... the boots? Hey I still wear those boots even now!  It's a scan of a photograph. There was a pre-digital era, ya know, not that long ago!  This one goes a little further back... guess the year...    Sorry, no pike."
374571,PikeMolester,2009-08-20 17:20:00,428,pre digital? whats that ? lol uhmmmm Id say 1958-1963

374600,pike slayer,2009-08-20 18:36:00,1177,"haha you put a ""few"" years back i say that was quite a few years back but nice fish indeed, one to remember! also my mom has a pair of boots like the exact same from back then and still wears them haha, the whole get up is just screaming the 80s!"
374673,Jonny,2009-08-20 22:24:00,1380," At my age, ""a few years back"" is a euphemism.  But the picture was actually taken in the 90's. (Early 90's granted) That was one of my most memorable outings... that's why I dug back in the ""archives"". It was so warm that day that by sunset the bottom had gone out of the snow and we had a hard time getting back down the lake (7 miles) to the lodge. There was a foot of slush, topped by a foot of wet snow.  The whole get-up? Blue jeans, hooded sweatshirt, checkered flannelette shirt, ball cap. I still dress that way when fishing or hunting! Are you saying I'm old-fashioned?"
374682,K_F,2009-08-20 22:46:00,107,Thoese arent just any boots.....those are Sorels if im not mistaken very nice
374751,PikeMolester,2009-08-21 02:47:00,428,lol i had sorels in the early 90s too.....but I WAS 5 YEARS OLD!

These ones are from Little Vermilion Lake, about 6 hours north of Thunderbay Ontario. They were caught toward the end of May, start of June. All over these were well over 40, the biggest were over 45 inches. I use 50-65lb braided lien with 80lb fluro leaders for pike. Although you'll see some of these were caught while walleye fishing with 20lb braid...  2005            2007 - these three were all on the same lure - that I made myself!    Caught this one about 2 minutes after the one above...   "

373936,steverowbotham,2009-08-18 23:54:00,1800,I'll post pics from my best day this year.  Went out for an afternoon with my girlfriend and my dad.  We waited out the rain in the morning and got out around noon.  Best day of pike fishing I've had in Southern Ontario.  Fish caught on jerkbaits mostly.                      Can't ask for much better than that

374039,Dara,2009-08-19 02:58:00,3052,"We caught a wack of pike last week...20 or 30 anyway. All trolling 3 to 5' of water with 4"" gold and silver williams wablers. We could see the fish (40 inchers) swimming as we were trolling for them. (something to be said for a 4 stroke maybe)...I got tired of catching weeds so I went shallow. 50' back and 6"" down. I could see the lure and the pike were coming up and smashing it."

There is a abundance of Pike in there a whole lot of hammerhandles but a few in the 30's.  If you go in June or later hard to get anything.  This year when we went, my one buddy throws a Chartuese Mepps # 5 and I a black orange, he contunally catches fish I try a pile of others and nothing works, even others chartuese ones.  He out fishes like 25 to 5 on the day?? I now have a few of those in the box!! Happy fishing"

374399,ehg,2009-08-20 03:07:00,2666,Have not fished pike seriously for years but use to fish around Toronto a lot in the spring. Used a boat and trolled deep diving rapalas slowly with good results. Was named 'Pike angler of the year' for a couple of years by Canadian Sportfishing after a couple of trips down to Toronto Harbour in each late March some years ago. Days of a couple of dozen fish in the 35-43 inch range were happening then. Now i rarely fish.  All the same day     buddy caught first fish of day before the sun broke out and fish really started slammin' 
374400,ciceri,2009-08-20 03:14:00,535," I use a 6'6"" medium action rod with 10 lb fireline crystal for every fish I catch. Biggest I caught on it was a 47"" musky."
