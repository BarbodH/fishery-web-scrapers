378976,splashhopper,2009-09-02 01:57:00,2931,"was fortunate to get out for some after-work fishing tonight...  tried an 8"" PINK senko  It worked for me tonight   this one didn't fall apart so i tossed it back at the same spot... two more times and wham.. another one   tossed a (new to me)frog out in another spot on top os some THICK slop and got this one >   damned if i can remember the name on the package( it's in the van though)..  decided to toss ""one more"" before heading home... and bang ! another one..    I haven't had a night like this in over a month...  loved every minute of it,.,,  btw... it is almost a full moon... does that make a difference for the fishing ?  thanks  splashhopper"
379010,Paully,2009-09-02 03:29:00,712,i tried casting off a peir for some salmon..  I can tell you it dident work out the way it did for you..
379042,spinnerbaitking,2009-09-02 11:48:00,1622,"That's a good night, there are supposed to be more big fish caught around the full & new moon, but I just go when I can & don't think alot about it, but when canoeing at night it's nicer on a full moon Richard"
379205,Cudz,2009-09-02 20:05:00,2652,Good fish.  That is some serious slop out there.
379262,splashhopper,2009-09-02 22:34:00,2931,"  I fish when I can too... this was the first time i paid any attention to the moon being out though... When I am fishing for trout... they seem to hit at night whether the moon is out or not...  I might be canoeing in yer neck of the woods this weekend.... likely at your ""in-laws private lake"" again I will either be on a red canoe or an old white sportspal... with an electric trolling motor hooked up to either of them.    I fish the ""serious slop"" because somebody on this board mentioned ""the sloppier the better"" and that adage seems to be working for me too... top water of course.."
