The bite was slow, one of the toughest bites this year, but they still managed to put some semi-decent fish in the boat.    Monday I took out a buddy from work for some Simcoe smallie action.  The bite was tough overall but we did manage to find one pod of aggressive fish that were more than willing to smash some jerkbaits.  Here's our best 4 for the day.    Tuesday, with the weather, I couldnt pass up another day on the water.  I invited another buddy from work to test out the action.  The bite was even tougher but we managed to take about a half dozen fish on a combination of tubes and jerkbaits. Same as the day prior, all fish were in 12-18 feet      Tonight I took Kelli out to enjoy some of the action.  We have our ""Classic"" coming up at work and we want to do well.  I'm expecting a decent jerkbait bite and wanted Kelli on her game, what better lake to practice on!?!  "

379366,Cudz,2009-09-03 05:03:00,2652,Yeah I know what you mean about 12-18.  I hae been catching in 13 - 18 as well.  They are moving out a bit.  The topwater night bite is done completely.  Last 2 times I have ben out only 2 blowups and no fish at night.  They are getting fat.
