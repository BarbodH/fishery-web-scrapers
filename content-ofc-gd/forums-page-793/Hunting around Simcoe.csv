379181,fisher,2009-09-02 18:59:00,451,My dad and I love to fish together and have also spent some time the last few years hunting but with little success in the latter sport.  He heard that there are hunting opportunities in and around Lake Simcoe that is accessible by the public and wanted to know if I knew anything/anywhere to go.  In the past we have hunted around Shelbourne but that has been very hit and miss the last couple of years.  I am not familiar with the Lake Simcoe hunting areas so I wouldn't even know where to start looking.  I am throwing this out with the hopes that a member of the board can point me in the right direction.  I am looking for a guide or someone to go hunting with in and around Lake Simcoe for Geese/Ducks?  Willing to pay for a 1/2 days outing as this would make a perfect gift for my dad's 60th birthday coming up in a couple of weeks.
