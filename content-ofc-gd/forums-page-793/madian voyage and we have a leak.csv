378104,skinny,2009-08-30 18:20:00,442,ok so got up at 6am and headed to Waterford ponds to try out the boat and do some fishing I get there and have to wait for others to get in the water my turn I get un loaded and try to get going but we have some wind and i'm getting blown around a bit the old trolling motor that came with the boat isn't enough and looks like there is water at bback of boat. um should bail that. hey I know open up the orange thing I bought that has all the saftey stuff in it to bail ok bailed . hmmmmm wounder if it's the plug in the boat guy said it was new. back to sore and drag the boat to shore to check it's loose I tighten it and try to head out again . wind has gone and I'm getting some place things settle down I start to get it figured out and  darn water still in boat bail start fishing  and bail every once and while it leaks but you can bail it i also think it only leaks when sitting not when moving  so how do you check for leaks or find leaks when it's at home  was still good day got 2 bass in the boat and missed a bunch either i was going to fast or not paying attention
378108,Cudz,2009-08-30 18:28:00,2652,if it is a tinner then set it up on a wood stand and fill it with water.  go under the boat and check to see where it is leaking.

378197,skinny,2009-08-30 22:33:00,442,no this wasn't the one that was supose to be the great deal but it wasn't a bad deal yet after the boat dried from my trip it was still in the back of my truck with the front hanging out so I started to fill the boat up to look for leaks. I found them i'm guessing that the caulking  on the center rib has dried up because as you add water the more it leaks but seems it's not at a rivit location but inbetween them  So next question is how do I reseal this  looking for ideas and options
378235,Cudz,2009-08-30 23:48:00,2652,temporary fix.  Get a friend with a hammer and get him to hold it on the rivet that is leaking.  You go on the opposite side and hit the same rivet. THis tightens them for a bit.
378276,skinny,2009-08-31 00:46:00,442,i'm not so sure it's the rivet that are leaking like I said it apears the sealer has gone very hard
378284,Jeff Wiles,2009-08-31 01:02:00,55,spray in or roll on bead liner will fixer up nice and make it ridged as new.  :D    JW
378291,splashhopper,2009-08-31 01:11:00,2931, do u have a brand name for this stuff?  thanks
378430,Jeff Wiles,2009-08-31 14:33:00,55,Rino liner is the only one I can think of. call your local parts store thay will have it or point you to some one who will do it for you.I would take the boat to some one who does truck bed liners.   JW
378496,wask,2009-08-31 18:34:00,174,"  Line-X is good too, but there are a bunch of them now I think"
378504,solopaddler,2009-08-31 18:56:00,8605,JB Weld has worked well patching tin boats for me. The one I patched 6 years ago had a toonie sized hole in the keel and it's still going strong.
378505,Uncle Buck,2009-08-31 18:56:00,1000,J & J marine in hagersville re-riveted my bow...  It doesn't leak anymore and it didn't cost me much either...  http://www.jandjmarine.com/
378507,WeedLine,2009-08-31 18:59:00,322,I would put some epoxy putty on it.
378511,PMack,2009-08-31 19:04:00,9,"Go to a parts store and pick up some windshield sealer and gob her up. I also agree with the bed liner stuff. You can pick that stuff up cheap if you don't buy the name brand stuff.  Good luck  CHeers,  PMack"

378521,irishfield,2009-08-31 19:26:00,26272,"Just do it right the first time.......  Sikaflex and rebuck the rivets or replace and patch as necessary. Skip the ""magic"" sealers and the heartache that's gonna go with them."
378888,Uncle Buck,2009-09-01 19:16:00,1000, I did my boat right Wayne... I sent it out and the guy had at her... no leaks now... much better then what i originally had planned...
