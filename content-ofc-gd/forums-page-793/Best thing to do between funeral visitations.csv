The bridge is 97 years old. Wish I had of thought to take fishing equipment with us last month as well. This sport we all love so much made a huge difference in our moods for the works of us.              After the visitations are over for the day... a picture tells no lies! lol

378656,irishfield,2009-09-01 00:58:00,26272," In 1912 the Smiths Falls Bascule Bridge was built to carry the Canadian Northern Railway mainline over the Rideau Canal. It is a Scherzer rolling-lift railway bridge and is one of the oldest remaining bascule bridges in Canada. Originally designed to be run with a DC powered electric motor, in 1915 the bridge was forced to be operated manually for the next 63 years until it was closed in 1978. The bridge was designated a National Historic Site in 1983."

378995,Moosebunk,2009-09-02 02:50:00,3970,I'd still prefer that the next time you're in the area killing time that you and Leah do it at our place.
