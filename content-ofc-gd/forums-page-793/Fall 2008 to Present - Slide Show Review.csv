Wouldn't mind seeing a report of your trip   I use Windows Movie Maker that comes with XP SP2.   Thanks Dusky!!!   Thanks Will!!!   Thanks ehg!!!  Yes the other 2 amigos caught monster specks but did not have the pics on my camera.... that is why they are not in this slideshow.
379210,NAW,2009-09-02 20:27:00,4022,Nice rack on your Buck!  Good way to fill the freezer.  I like the shot placement    How long was the shot??
379280,Leecher,2009-09-02 23:48:00,7832," Thanks F to the Is-H!!!  That buck came onto the dirt road 400 yards away from me and made it's way at 60 yards and stopped to look behind him, that is when I raised the scope about half an inch and pulled the drigger for the kill in the neck.  It was the only target I had from my position in the tree stand because he was facing me.  He never even saw or smelled me.... Dropped him right in his tracks on the side of the road.... Biggest buck harvested for me and easiest to put on the truck tail gate  Here is a picture from my tree stand.... Looking at the dirt road, the fartest you can see is where he came onto it and started walking toward me in no hurry..... this is when I grabbed my 303, took the safety off and waited patiently    in front of the jimmy there's a hump and below the hump is where he stopped and look behind him  "
