I was reeling in and my reel fell off the pole. I checked the turn down thing on it and it was tight. What the hell ! Looked again and saw that the plasic reel seat had broken.  So what to do with it? Bought it at LB but since it is an hour drive from here and I no longer have the receipt, I tried Can. Tire for the heck of it. I didn't have the rod with me as I just wanted to inquire and told him I bought it there. He said NO. It still has the LeBaron price tag on it, if I get around LB's neighbouhood Ill drop in and ask them. Anyone else ever break a reel seat?"
