Or somebody near you sees you with a fish and then gets on the radio. Soon you are in a virtual marina 10 miles from shore. LOL
378616,Canuck2fan,2009-08-31 23:32:00,1444," I fish a lot with guys who have been bottom fishing certain holes in rivers for over 20 yrs. Lately the word got out about these spots on the net. Now we constantly have C and R guys drive up from the big smoke and try to take over the whole river. It never seems to matter to them that we there bottom fishing at 3:30AM while they got in just after light.... So then it becomes a contest of who can outlast the other. If the C and R guys hang around which is only if the fishing is good they will stay all day catching and releasing as many as they can. Where as us River meat hunters are only looking for one salmon and a maxium of two bows.  I always wonder who actually kills more fish in the long run? Someone who goes out 2 to 3 times a season and keeps maybe 6 fish max or someone who through the season catches well over a hundred but ""releases"" them?"
378666,StoneFly,2009-09-01 01:16:00,574," Well I think those fish are more resiliant than you may think.  Let me just clarify that I have no problem at all with somone keeping a fish for the table as long as they are doing it legally and legit.   Sounds like you are from some northern area to the GTA.  Down here, you see alot of peeps intentionally trying to snag fish because they want to eat them.  There are also those that slaughter for eggs and leave the meat to rot.  The simple long and short of it is that Lake O pacific salmon have been deemed unfit for human consumption.  Anyone that eats them is obviously doing it by choice and that is their right.  I have caught a fresh salmon in the mouth on a fly with 5 or 6 #4-6 hooks in its tail most likely from bottom bouncers and that fish fought quite well.  There is always someone down this way that wants to eat one, so I dont mind giving one or 2 away per year as long as its a female.  Regarding the catch and release argument killing more fish, how do you apply that to other species, like lets say, Bass, Pike or Musky?  and I should mention that much larger tackle and hooks are used on those ones which often causes bleeding.  Heck, there is a post on the front page right now of a 7lb largemouth that was caught, kept out of the water for well over a minute with videos and pics and running around between docks to find a camera in the dark.  Nothing but congrats were showered, and Bass are native fish, not stockers for pure sportfishing.  Just curious on the thoughts???  BTW,...no offence to MTB, I would have done the same..Lol...I just to see if the same argument here applies to more than one or 2 species.  Cheers,"
378760,cuzza,2009-09-01 12:20:00,467, Out of interest why would you keep the female but preumably release the males?
378763,Twocoda,2009-09-01 12:33:00,4130,females produce roe ( spawn) also sometimes known as bait....if you take roe from a fish it is your obligation to keep the fish regardless of how black it is ...
378779,holdfast,2009-09-01 12:59:00,1813,"Wow kind of gives me Memories of fishing for Salmon on the Vedder River in BC.  One side is DND property where I was, on the other side Public.  Seems people fish the holes and they have names.  Well I watched a great scrap and the guy I was voting for got the fish and won the fight.  He lands a salmon, and brings it back from shore to take the hook out and his neighbor parks himself at the very spot the fish catcher caught his fish.  After some yelling a good fight broke out and the smaller guy just laid it into him.   That kind of fishing doesn't turn me on, I like Solitude, Peace and quiet, but mostly fish that bite to eat.  No Im with you though, I would never thing of fishing where my rod may chuck someone in the mouth."
379066,Canuck2fan,2009-09-02 13:59:00,1444,"You are correct about me not fishing Lake O or its tribs.  Salmon are a put and take fish and whatever happens that is LEGAL is fine with me.  I think C and R for steel head is different from other species for a couple of reasons.  One, if you are river fishing for them they usually heading into spawning mode. That makes them more vulnerable and easier to harm, because they are under the stress that spawning puts on them. I don't know of too many musky fishermen who fish them during their spawning runs same goes for bass unless it is up north where they are a nuisance fish anyway so it doesn't matter as long as the ministry guidelines are being followed.  What makes me really concerned about fall fishing in the rivers for steel in recent years is the fact we are finding more than a few of the female trout are fall spawners on the Huron tribs. I have seen a lot of females that had loose eggs as early as November 1st in the past two years. Also just after ice out on a couple of rivers we have seen females dropping back that have spawned when the water temperature was not close to being high enough in the spring, in the second or third week of February in some cases. So one has to assume she spawned in the fall when it was and waited out the winter up river.  The other reason is I see a lot of C and R steelhead guys using new roe sacks every third cast if it doesn't get a hit it is torn off and new one is put on..... Where do they get all this roe from? I am sure most of them don't have a trout hatchery in their backyard and to buy it from a tackle shop would cost a small fortune at the rate they go through the stuff. So at some point they are havesting fish in most cases. I have seen some even milk a fish and try to release it. I told them to take the fish home as they have probably killed it anyhow, and it is the law. That gets a lot of blank stares.... I just don't get how they can act so morally superior to a meat hunter when they stand there all day and hook maybe 10 to 20 fish that even with a 10 percent mortality rate is going to mean they have killed more fish that the meat hunter who might take his limit of two home and actually use them."
379141,cuzza,2009-09-02 17:06:00,467," Makes sense, thanks"
379255,Twocoda,2009-09-02 21:59:00,4130,  No problem cuzza ....the worst question is the one that isnt asked...
379364,StoneFly,2009-09-03 04:53:00,574," I personally do not Kill Rainbow trout for meat or eggs, nor milk them for eggs, I also dont change a rowbag every 2-3 drifts.  I actually use salmon eggs for the most part if i even use eggs.  I tend to use alot of flies and pink worms.  In addition, I do everything in my power to release the fish properly so she takes off like a bullet.  I also prefer the G-Bay tribs, but its sometimes hard to argue with the numbers and sizes that some of the lake O tribs offer.  Im Not defending any of the tactics you mentioned. but I would still aregue more fish are killed in the pursuit of meat than anything else, ESPECIALLY on some of the northern tribs.  I guess we have each had our own experiences, hence the no kill zone that came into place along the notty.  Again, no issues here with anyone taking one for the table, I just dont prefer it unless I give it to a friend who really wants it and that might be once a year.  Regarding rainbows, I would much rather see that female make 1000's of little ones.  we should also keep in mind the reason the fish are here in the first place.  Regarding what you said about Fall spawning, it is my understanding that the majority of the fish the come up in the fall hold all winter and then spawn in the spring."

377431,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-28 15:08:00,0,"While steelheading this spring I had a man (who was an OPP officer) come up and stand in the centre of the riffle at the head of the pool i was fishing and start letting his float drift right in front of my down the entire length of the pool.  After a few warning shots across his bow I began hooking his line intentionally.  After a few ""accidents"" he still didn't get the picture.  Because there was 4 other pools within a few hundred metres I left, because I figured getting into it with a police officer wouldn`t work out in my favour.  That said, when I was leaving the parking lot my fishing partner and I left enough gobs of phlegm and snot on his windshield and hood that I hope he got the message.  Immature...perhaps...but damn it felt good."
377478,Hooked,2009-08-28 19:09:00,891,"Personally, I find it ignorant when people do that.  But I have to say, this time of year brings out the worst type of wanna be fisherman cuz it's pretty simple to catch the fish.  And some guys are just ignorant all the time, but its something unfortunately you'll have to deal with here in Canada. I'd rather fish a spot where my chances of catching a fish are slimmer, but have to deal with very little crowds.  On a side note, I fished on a pier where no one was fishing, as it turned out I caught 4 salmon, so it can payoff fishing the area's nobody is trying."

By the way I'm only 40, and got so fed up I just had to buy a boat  . If you can, try to ask people politely to move when they crowd you. As stated earlier, in a few weeks, everyone will be shoulder to shoulder on the banks. If you want to be a part of that bring the patience of a Saint, otherwise river rage might set in  ."

I admittedly don't know a thing about float fishing, but it sounds like it uses a disproportionate amount of water (you throw the line out and it floats down stream through the desired strike zone then you pull it in and do it again. Am I close?). So it requires a coordinated effort to have it work for everybody involved. But if buddy drives in from Upper Suburbia and wants to cast his Five-of-Diamonds out there 'cause that is how he thinks he can catch fish, he can't because the float types have staked a large claim in the river. I realize that the original post was not about float fishing, but is the whole thing not about just how much of the river do you own at that moment? I think that with so many people and so few spots, conflict is inevitable. Jim"

Didn't we learn anything from the ""nipper tipping"" nonsense. Regardless of any racial overtones, if you push someone in, at the very least, it is battery. More likely you can be charged with assault. If he gets hurt, etc....   the consequences will become very severe indeed. Unfortunately, the etiquette of fishing that some of us were raised on, has basically died. It has been replaced by the North American mentality of "" anything goes until you get caught"". It's not just fishing where you find this selfishness. It happens hunting, golfing, hiking the trails,  on the sidewalk, and worst of all, our highways."
377743,ChrisK,2009-08-29 14:17:00,2772,"My two cents worth....  Back in the old days when I subjected myself to the masses I had a system that worked for me when it came to this kind of thing....Patients and a good sharp pair of scissors. I spent more time handing piles of mono back to their rightful owners accompanied with all the swivels,lead and cleos to fill a dump truck.As I snipped and cut away all the debree from my rig to my best advantage a lot of this newly found swag would sometimes end up at my feet in the river (pending on the owners persistence) unretreivable due to current and depth . A kind apology to the owner for the loss of his hardware and I retie and carry on fishing. You see, its all about educating new and sometimes older fisherman on the river if you have the patients... Most of the time folks that are new to fishing around float fisherman just don't realize their are float fishing ethics and it goes a little farther than just chucking out a cleo and crankin it back in waiting for a hit. Timing between drifts so as to permit the float guy beside you get his drift  in and sometimes you can have as many as ten float guys doing their drifts all at the same time,some running the outside lanes and some running the inside... and then it happens...All it takes is one person to foul this fine balancing act of synchronized fishing talent....You can see the territorial state of mind at the river a mile away when the guys are all float fishing together or even as individuals......Its just human nature... So we as float fisherman(I am also in this group) must ""suck it up"" and use our brains and not our brawn to declare psychological ware fare against our most worthy opponents while fishing at the river which are supposed to be the fish by the way but sometimes ends up being just a little bit more,if you get ""my drift"".....Lets keep it fun !!!  Bottom line,no pun intended.....Know one owns the river and assault is against the law.  Cheers !!"

378073,StoneFly,2009-08-30 16:50:00,574,"Some interesting experiences and tactics LOL,  90% of the time I fish the less populated areas and still have a great day with many fish, although there is the odd time a couple buddies and I will hit one of the crowded holes at the beggining of the season simply because the fish havent made it up any further.  I have always found most guys get along, respect the space and when you hear 'Feeeeesh on' everyone reels in quickly and gives you room to play the fish.  There is the odd tangle but this is usually accidental and gets striaghtened out.  Upon approach to a hole, if things are tight, I usually ask if they wouldn't mind if I shared the drift, and noone has ever said no.  I find most river fisherpeople to be pretty friendly.  The most fun is when you see 20 guys fishing a hole with roe and not much action, so I start out with a fly and get a strike the first drift, Lol.  However, one thing that bugs me is when you get guys intentionally snagging salmon.  I always take some patience and try to help them fish properly and show the difference that every fish they hook into in the belly or tail and every one I hook into is in the mouth.  So if the guy keeps doing it, I have in the past done one of 3 things.  1)  Tell them that is illegal and there is a warden around the corner. 2)  Get in the river, tail the fish unhook it and release it. 3)  Pull out my scissors and cut his line.  Never had to resort to pushing anyone in, YET, Lol  One of the funniest things I have ever seen was taking BOWSHEP out for the very first time at a quiet little salmon haunt.  I loaned him a pair of my old rubber chestwaders and at the time he had a 46"" waste, so they were like spandex on him, Lol.  So after a few drifts he hooks into a good size fish and as he is fighting it (musky style), was pulling and leaning back so far that when the fish turned and swam straight at him he fell back flat on his ass in 2-3 feet of water and was nearly submerged.  I almost fell in laughing so hard and instead of reaching to help him, all I could do was reach for my camera, LOL.  Even funnier is that he should have been soaked inside his waders and out, but they were so tight that he was completely dry.  LMAO   Its almost time river people, lets all play nice out there and have fun!!!"
378243,Canuck2fan,2009-08-31 00:04:00,1444," I agree that things are getting out of hand but it isn't JUST because of the North American mentality in my opinion.... It is because there are a very few people from EVERYWHERE who are just plain ignorant these days.  What I always find interesting is that the people who will horn seem to have went to the same school of bad manners even though you know that is impossible LOL. I mean the scenerio is the EXACT same every time it happens to me and it goes like this.  Someone approaches with the gleam of a 49er hunting ore in their eyes because a fish was landed. As they wipe the drool from their lips you or the person fishing there tell them politely, ""listen I know you want to fish there but there isn't room and you are going to tangle the rest of us up.""  They reply word for word with, ""This isn't your river, pier or lake it is a free country, I have a licence I can fish anywhere I want...."" yadda yadda yadda. And bam first cast they have snagged everybody 3 people over on either side of them. Then they don't even have the moral decency to be EMBARRASSED about doing it.  Not much you can do about it when even after the third tangle up they are still sitting there fishing smiling just as happy as if they had a brain...  However having a cigar lit to use on the person's line each time they snag you can have a calming effect or your blood pressure ;o)"

The bonus is you can teach a Hack snagger how to fish properly while you do it.  if its Salmon,..no biggie..;  Steelhead is a different ballpark, get the scissors out..lol."
378354,Fishnwire,2009-08-31 04:25:00,983,"I have to admit I didn't read the whole thread...that said, people who think they own public property because they happen to be standing near it at the time are way off base.  If someone is standing so close to you that your lines become tangled in the normal course of fishing, that's one thing.  However, some posters on this thread have suggested purposely casting your line at your neighbour's, thereby intentionally causing a tangle to send them a message.  It would seem to me that purposely fouling another angler's line is a much, much bigger example of ""poor fishing etiquette"" than crowding others at popular public fishing areas could ever be.  Basically, if there are two anglers, one minding his own business and the other trying to tangle lines...the second guy is clearly the bigger jerk of the two.  No doubt about it.  You want to see a crowd?  Try smelt fishing during the spring run on the Magnetawan river, south of Sudbury.  It's shoulder to shoulder with almost no room to work your net...and if you don't like it, your only other option is to stay home.  Often times in this province, there are more anglers than there are desirable angling locations.  Unless you own lake-front property, or are prepared to travel off the beaten path, sharing space is a part of angling."
378356,Jonny,2009-08-31 04:54:00,1380,"Where we live on Nipissing there are no distinct shoals to attract spring fishermen in the first couple of weeks of the season. Fishing the flats off river and creek mouths can be productive too, but it tends to spread the boats out more so they don't get in each others' way. I recall times, however, fishing the Laronde Rocks with my Dad and my Grandpa, where the boats crowded so close together that they were in each other's way. If you started catching pickerel one after the other, other boats would sidle up so close that you couldn't cast, and sometimes even so close that you couldn't properly fight a fish you had hooked. There were some frayed tempers at those times too, as I recall.  The other thing I've seen often enough is somebody cutting across your troll lines, even if they can see that you're obviously trolling. It's aggravating but there's no percentage in getting too belligerent.  This talk of pushing somebody else into the water is too extreme for me, even though I can sympathize with the thought. It sounds like a great way to ruin your day, as well as possibly being charged.  I do like the idea of cutting somebody else's line if it gets tangled with yours more than once or twice because the other fellow isn't paying attention to ""personal space""."

Anyway, I have no problem with other people trying their luck and if it puts the fish off then so be it. I'm fishing in a 10-15 yds gap between the end of a line of boats and a load of rocks and some guy turns up and sets up in the space between me and the boats, if he'd had a 10ft rod he'd have tickled me with on every cast! To cap it all, every time I stopped fishing to change lures, there was a splash of this guys crankbait landing in front of me!

377095,Lunatic,2009-08-27 13:44:00,536,"Best answer.   I cant stand being crowded,and i dont hesitate to let them know. if i see someone coming and i think they  might try to squeeze in i will cast my line across the area to discourage them fro trying. but some people are just born ignorant,and punching them in the face may be very tempting,it turns your stress free fishing day into a nightmare day."
377098,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-27 13:53:00,0,"Side by side, shoulder to shoulder. The man with the biggest equipment wins!    Bigger Rod, heavier line, larger lures. .... A pair of scissors. One way to fill up your tackle box.  and make friends real quick."
377106,BITEME,2009-08-27 14:11:00,1968,"Well cuz since you were on my home turf and will really never know if it was me or not i can tell you this if i can squeeze into a spot i will and the space you referred to can hold 3 even if a boat is in the last slot personnely if you had of said something to me i would of told you whats the term in the UK ""SOD OFF"". anyway as has been said you better get use to that the time approaches its gonna get tight and if you cant play nice you will be told. Welcome to Canada!!!!!!  JMO"
377108,[email protected],2009-08-27 14:12:00,290,It gets like that at Wilkes Dam in Brantford every day.  Pisses me off too. Guy that was there on Saturday with me was fishing for minnows directly in FRONT of me while I was casting. I was like... what the hell?
377119,BillM,2009-08-27 14:54:00,17367,"I've never really had that problem, even steelhead fishing..  Maybe cause I'm not the most approachable looking guy on the banks?  However, after coming back to my spot after landing a fish I have found people thinking the spot I was some kind of gold mine.  I'll get right up besides them and start drifting away (not in tune with them of course)    But yeah, that's bull, I would have tossed a few casts his way for sure..."
377126,alctel,2009-08-27 15:09:00,26,"I guess Ottawa has something going for it after all, I hardly ever see a guy near any of my 'spots'"
377127,Dara,2009-08-27 15:11:00,3052,"That sounds like a real interesting place to fish. Lots of friendly people. If I'm within 100 yards of another boat on St Marys its busy.  well, cept at the Garden, then you got about 30 yards. just be trolling the right pattern"
377128,tdotfisherman,2009-08-27 15:24:00,317,"Yep.. you better get used to that kind of crap around the Greater Toronto Area.. as many people have already said.. there are a lot of fisherman, and not too many good spots (especially during Salmon/Steelhead season).  I'm not really too bothered by this kind of behavior because I'm not exposed to it as much.. I work odd hours and when I head out fishing the tribs for Steelhead or fishing the piers for Salmon its usually the middle of the night or early morning and its basically dead out there, and people don't usually push their way into a tight spot.  But hey, if someone's behavior has bothered you, or you think they've gotten too close feel free to politely talk to them about it, and maybe they will move."
377132,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-27 15:47:00,0,hahaha!  gross! that's why i avoid the GTA like the plague! if someone fished that close to me i would cast over his line EVERY cast until he found a more reasonable range.
377143,Twocoda,2009-08-27 16:55:00,4130,Im ashamed to say this but ....after several warning to a guy crossing my line and fishing literally right in my pocket ...after the third time ....i pushed him in the river ...needless to say he had to go  and change his clothes so i got to enjoy the rest of the day fishing with lots of room as everyone that was there shyed away from me ....lol...
377157,cuzza,2009-08-27 17:17:00,467,"Cheers guys, pretty much as I thought, it's silly season and it's in the middle of town, guess I'll have to look around for somewhere a little quieter.  Biteme - hope to see you down there at some point  As for 3 in that slot - to stand next to each other, yes, but what's the point if you have to cast straight ahead time after time?"
377165,Guest gbfisher,2009-08-27 17:37:00,0,You otta try river fishing there this fall if you like close comfort. It's truely a cesspool of comedy.
377239,timmeh,2009-08-27 21:49:00,609,The best thing to do is to start talking to the guy and just keep chatting away until he gets so annoyed with you he'll usually leave on his own. Really chat him up and bother him. It usually works.
377292,shane,2009-08-28 01:02:00,652,Ask him if he likes to go camping.  Then wink at him.
377347,GBW,2009-08-28 03:42:00,8460,AHHHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHA broke-back-fishing?
377390,Jonny,2009-08-28 13:06:00,1380,"Unfortunately the best way to solve your problem involves money... you need to (if possible) buy yourself a canoe or a kayak (and of course have the means to store and transport it). Shore fishing in populated areas always means ""competition"" with other people, especially in popular areas at peak times, and really goes against the grain of what fishing is all about - a relaxing time involving you, the water and the fish."
377404,cuzza,2009-08-28 13:44:00,467," I think you've hit the nail on the head there, Jocko especially with the last sentence. Those fishing kayaks looks great - rod holder and all that  I'm not meaning to moan about anything, being able to to drive 5mins from my house, setup by the lake on a nice evening and fish is brilliant, bearing in mind almost all fishing in the UK involves paying for a day ticket on top of your annual license - just trying to understand the etiquette really.  Broke Back Fishing   - I'll look for a pink cap next time I'm up at BPS"
377409,Jonny,2009-08-28 14:01:00,1380," Not taken as a ""moan"" by anyone, I'm sure.  I wish you hadn't mentioned day tickets.  Some government type will pick up on this and think it's a great idea to regulate fishing (a.k.a. grabbing more money out of our pockets)."
