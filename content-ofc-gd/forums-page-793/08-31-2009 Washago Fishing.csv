Up until this point, all we've ever caught was small mouth bass, perch and rock bass.  We woke up early Saturday morning and took off down to the Green River in the pouring rain.  We fished there for about an hour and only came up with a few small perch and bass.  On our way back the rain was really coming down, so we stopped under the 169 bridge. After a few minutes we rowed out and the current took us to the shoreline under a bunch of trees.  The water was really shallow, only about 5-6 feet, and there was a giant felled tree laying in the water.  So I took my trust white jig head, with a half worm on it and plopped it in the water, as it was on its way down.... BAM...  My first Pike ever!    On the way back, my girlfriends brother caught this monster lunker.   We decided to head in. Later that day around 4pm we took the boats out again just out from our dock and I dropped the Jig down again, this time the water was about 15-20 feet in the middle.  BAM.   First Walleye I've caught up there, and first walleye in almost 10 years! After that we called it a day.  Sunday Morning we woke up and took off to a spot just around the corner from the cottage. A Very deep hole. About 20-25 feet.  After about 5 minutes of jigging (I got my gf's brother hooked on it now) he pulled in these 2 fish.   and this one   Finished off the day a few minutes later with    I didn't catch alot of fish, but I was so thrilled to catch my first Pike, and a nice walleye that I didnt care.  I can't wait to go again!"
