I've used worms most of the times I've went fishing, and you pretty much catch everything with that.  If so, what are the best lures for each species? I would like to catch muskie, but from what I read on these forums it's pretty unlikely to catch one, especially for unexperienced fishermen. Maybe some big pike? It's Lake Nipissing.  Also, in your opinions, what are the best fish to eat? Thanks!"

112390,tinbanger,2007-09-11 10:41:00,1028,"we almost always are targetting a particular species ,unfortunatly  the fish don't always know that  We have however had interesting 'no targetted 'catches ,first muskie ( buzzbait bass fishing) first carp ( senko bass fishing).  As far as Muskie goes the fish of a thousand casts seems understated .but I will catch my first one this fall  Best fish to eat ,we enjoy pike and perch  fall thru to spring , one ot two feed of smallmouth while interior camping . Personally I find Walleye a bit overrated as far as eating goes and prefer the fight of 30"" plus pike or Simcoe smallies .  TB"
