111809,goby,2007-09-10 00:59:00,18,I have a 16' fiberglass canoe and now I have a 36lb thrust minkota. Does anyone ave any designs for a sidemount?
111851,Nemo,2007-09-10 02:29:00,727,Hi Dan I made one from some parts I picked up from Home Depot.  30 inches of aluminum bracket and some maple to bolt on to.  Laminated the maple and screwed to the bracket. Then used some j screws to hook onto the gunwales. The screws use wing nuts so all is hand tightened.  The 2 horse is 27 pounds. I took this rig into Big Crow in APP with a buddy in May. Ran fine.  Only changes I would make.  Would be to use longer lengths of maple to stop some torquing of the bracket.      Any questions let me know

Did you put the J screws through the gunwales of the canoe??...if you did, do you think it would be possible to rig something up that would clamp down on the bottom and top of the gunwales without actually having to go through them??  Thanks Smitty"
111858,Nemo,2007-09-10 02:47:00,727,I went through the scuppers on the inwales. So no holes needed. As for something that woould screw down no problems. Perhaps another peice of metal that is tightened up against the bottom of the inwale.  Also when testing make sure you tie the motor off to the mother ship. If not you may be missing something.

It would also be beneficial to have the aluminum piece be an angle rather than a strip.  My 2 cents.... If it works... use it."
112225,goby,2007-09-10 23:12:00,18,Ido like your design but I agree that it should be made with angle. Your design is simple and would be easily made.  Thank you Dan Boy
