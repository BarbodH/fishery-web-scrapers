Took 20 minutes of cranking with the battery (can't believe the battery didn't die) before it fired up again.  It has never acted up before.  I called Sandy Cove marine but they don't work on Johnson's, although they did refer me to someone in Stroud.  Unfortunately he can't look at it until next week.  Anyone know someone around Barrie who works on these type of engines?"
