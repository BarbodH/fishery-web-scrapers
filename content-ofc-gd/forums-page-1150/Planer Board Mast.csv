112729,Bob Devine,2007-09-11 23:15:00,251,Most planer board masts are about 6' tall. One of the easiest masts to use is the Riviera Planer board mast. You can buy the model to fit into your seat base at the bow. They also have a model with spring loaded reels(Kachman) You can find more about Riviera and Off Shore Tackle products at www.offshoretackle.com Off Shore is the maker of the small inline boards uded by many walleye fishermen and women.
