112208,Pigeontroller,2007-09-10 22:42:00,2793,Nice ones!
112211,Mike the Pike,2007-09-10 22:47:00,3421,Darren you are such a tease first you tell us about your successful fishing trips and then you make us wait for the pics.Oh by the way do you ever catch anything small?Or I guess you don't post them.  Is Marc being camera shy again?  Nice fish really beautiful.  MTP
112214,Handlebarz,2007-09-10 22:53:00,3790,very nice slimers for shure
112215,Joey,2007-09-10 22:55:00,9122,"Wow, beautiful markings for sure.    Joey"
112217,darsky,2007-09-10 22:58:00,586,"Just something to add......take note on the health of these fish. No split fins,very minimal redness on all fins.These are all indications that very minimal stress was imposed on the fish. On top of that,they didn't just swim off-they bolted. I applaud Marc's release and handling methods,second to none.If anyone here will have the privilege of fishing with him take notes on how he handles the fishies."
112220,Pigeontroller,2007-09-10 23:00:00,2793,Marc is well known for his excellent care of the Esox that grace his boat!
