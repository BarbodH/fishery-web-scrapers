Going fishing this weekend want to hit either simcoe or georgian bay (honey harbour,moon river) i just don't know of any launches.  Was also thinking of Go Home lake....I know JohnnyBass has fished here before and by the looks of your report you did pretty good   if you can help me out or put me in the right direction   that would be awsome.   Many Thanks  Peps"
