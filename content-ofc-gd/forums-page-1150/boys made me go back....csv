I actually made a mad dash after the carp but with no luck.He was pretty upset as this one was bigger than the ones I had this morning.After calming him down and setting up again I hook into another one.I hand the rod to the older boy,who wants to do it himself, and the fight is on.I am trying to offer tips but after 1 long run he lowers the rod just enough for the carp to spit the hook.Now we are 0/2.I told them that at least they now have a taste of it.Now it is my turn and sure enough...  This one took forever to bring in and the boys were amazed at the fight.We tried for a little longer but with no luck so we left.They are both already talking about when they catch one tomorrow.I guess I can force myself to take them out again,lol."
112284,Rizzo,2007-09-11 01:24:00,4754,nice looking fish!  How in the world do you find time to go fishing that often though?  I clearly need a different job (oh ya and a family that enjoys fishing)
112288,fatherof3,2007-09-11 01:32:00,1769,"hey Rizzo,my secret is simple.Be low man at work,get laid off and have nothing better to do.The free time will come to an end soon though."
112291,Rizzo,2007-09-11 01:44:00,4754,haha..low man on totem pole is the way to great fishing I guess! Unfortunately my wife's shopping habits prohibit me from taking this approach.  That's why I'm an OFC'er...to live vicariously through others' fishing adventures.  Thanks for all your reports everyone!
112297,wolfville,2007-09-11 02:02:00,396,That's a nice fish. I'm so jealous.
112435,Jay T,2007-09-11 12:28:00,282,"Good for you man, you have been into them carp good the past couple of days. Next time I am sure the boys will land one, at least they got to feel how strong they are. WTG"
112468,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 13:20:00,7971,Wow...fantastic results!! 3 hook ups in a short while is a great evening of carping.  Great job....it's an experience your kids wont forget and will make it all the sweeter for them when they manage to bring one in for themselves.

112520,Jen,2007-09-11 15:38:00,833,"The kids will figure it all out soon enough... Kudos to you for making memories with them that will last not only through their lifetime but be carried on through the generations.  Nice fish!  Cheers,  Jen"
