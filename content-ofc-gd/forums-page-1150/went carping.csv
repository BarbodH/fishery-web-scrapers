112029,fatherof3,2007-09-10 17:24:00,1769,"After last night this is all I was thinking about.I had an hour to kill this morning so went back down.After all the baiting of the area figured I might have a shot.I almost left home without my camera and man am I glad I went back and got it.I was down there and 3rd cast I get a solid hit and fish on.Fight it for a bit and line snaps! Here we go again I figure.I did put heavier line on but drag was too tight.I set up again and soon get another hit.No way am I going to lose this one.Here is the proof!   I was by myself with no scale or tape so the only thing I could think of was to use my foot(size 11) for comparison.Very next cast this guy decides to hit.   He put up quite the fight for his size with a few good runs.By this time I am really having fun.I cast out again and wait but nothing.I bait the area some more for later and cast out one last time before I head home. Just as I am about to give up and go home I get another solid hit.This one takes off for the other side of the river in one big run as I just hold on. The next thing I now the rod eases up and no more pulling. Great,I lost him I think as I start to real in. All of a sudden I catch up to the fish,who is still on as he is charging at me!The fight is back on and after a couple more runs bring him in.    So,after losing 3 last night I go 3/4 in an hour.I am quite happy right now and can't wait to show the kids the pics and get back there again.Here is one more pic for now. "
112040,tbayboy,2007-09-10 17:43:00,1497,Thats awesome.  Sounds like we have a new carp addict on the board
112041,Uncle Buck,2007-09-10 17:44:00,1000,That's a sweet mirror carp...  I still haven't caught one yet  Carping Rocks!!!
112043,MJL,2007-09-10 17:47:00,2427,Congrats on that!  You've managed to catch a beauty mirror carp.  Just as rare as a sober Irishman if you ask me.  WTG
112044,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 17:55:00,7971,Beauty mirror carp!! I have yet to catch one of those.  Carp are a lot of fun...it's a great way to learn how to fight a big fish.  The learning from carp fishing will take you into other even harder fighting fish...and make you more confident in landing them.  Great report and pics....great job out there!
