112358,Minnow,2007-09-11 05:25:00,177,Another report from this summer! Didn't keep up on my reports so catching up now!  Went carp fishing at night with my grandpa and hooked this nice fish on a sinker and corn! Great Fight!    Went again a couple days later and landed this nice one right under one of the trent river locks! These fish are amazing fighters! Great fun from shore! If anyone wants to hook into some nice carp visit any of the trent locks and they are stacked with fish!
