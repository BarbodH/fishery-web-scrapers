112183,mikeymikey,2007-09-10 21:56:00,376,Why not use your Carp gear?  I've seen one person using carp rod.
112186,wuchikubo,2007-09-10 22:01:00,1114,WTG on your first salmon!
112198,FinS,2007-09-10 22:16:00,463,very nice Cliff wtg its a rush isnt it
112219,DT10Sam,2007-09-10 23:00:00,480,"Wellllllll.........we all know if it wasn't for Bly you would not have started this thread  LOL...WTG Cliff nice salmon.  Regards, Sam"
112240,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 23:40:00,7971, I dont have real Carp gear.  I was using a 9 foot surf rod with a rather large spinning reel for carp.  It's a bit cumbersome using that rod for casting lures...I'd last maybe 10 casts before my arms got to tired...LOL.  It's good for me for carp...you cast and just let it sit there...maybe 10 casts in the entire outing...haha.
112241,canadian_copper,2007-09-10 23:43:00,925,NICE JOB BRO!!! CONGRATS!!
112243,Victor,2007-09-10 23:44:00,1609,amazing fish! thanks for the pics & report  definitely gotta try it out this year
112253,PERCHER,2007-09-11 00:18:00,787,WTG Cliff.Glad to see you nailed your p.b.Salmon fishing is a blast.They are total power houses.HOOK UP AND HANG ON!
112279,ecxstriper,2007-09-11 01:16:00,343,I use a shock leader because I throw 5>6 oz of lead plus a few more ozs of bait with a 12' surf rod. I can get 100 yrds every time and some times get up to 150 yrds. Cliff was using a shock leader to add some stretch to his line as he was using power pro which has no stretch to speak of .The shock leader allows for some forgiveness of braided line's lack of stretch without tacking up space on the spool. There are several knots used to join mono to braid I use 2 the double uni knot and the alberto knot (variation of the albright knot). alberto knot http://www.stripersonline.com/Pages/Articl...rtos_knot.shtml double uni knot http://www.marinews.com/Double-Uni-Knot-26...3958a6b4522e462 Last Monday while casting a 5 oz lead  my power pro snapped and sent the lead rocketing out to sea. I am verythankful that it happened over the water and not in mid cast as the lead would have shot down the beach where there were other fisherman!!!
112368,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-11 07:40:00,1183,Sweeeeeetttttt.  Congrats.
111922,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 11:25:00,7971," Thanks Joey...She didnt' buy a net.  I had a salmon hooked the other week, only to have it break my 30lb power pro.  She went out and bought shock leaders to try to avoid a repeat of that experience!  I must say that it came in very handy!"
111923,solopaddler,2007-09-10 11:26:00,8605,WTG Cliff!
111924,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 11:28:00,7971," I was using 30 pound power pro...with a shock leader.  Since power pro has no stretch, break offs can happen fairly easily...had one do just that last week.  Good luck and at least you had 3 salmon on...many nights I'm out there with not even a hit."
111934,BITEME,2007-09-10 11:45:00,1969,Nice CLIFF    WELCOME TO YOUR NEW FALL ADDICTION!!!!!!!!
111953,Golfisher,2007-09-10 12:56:00,586,  That's exactly what I had to do last week with my first salmon!  LOL  Congrats on your catch; I'm sure this is just the beginning of a long series of successful outings.
111969,Bly,2007-09-10 13:39:00,1556,"  Mike.......     Ya, what he said   All joking aside, it is a great fish, he deserves it and I am very very happy for him!!!!"
111980,Fishmaster,2007-09-10 15:07:00,920,way to go nice King
111982,Hedfish,2007-09-10 15:09:00,76,"Grats, man! Great story, made me wish to try for salmon as well."
111985,Headhunter,2007-09-10 15:27:00,5703,"Well done Cliff! I guess if you have to get out, a big Chinny is better than a few pannies! HH"
111987,lazybum,2007-09-10 15:40:00,142,Nice going.  You are certainly hooked now.  All that practice with Carp is paying off now.  I took a walk out that way on Saturday night for some fresh air but didn't fish.
111988,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 15:43:00,7971," I was actually saying to Bly that landing carp was GREAT practice for me.  If I had not landed them earlier this spring, I think I would have lost this one for sure.  They are similar in some regards, but I learned how to play BIG fish targeting Carp."
111991,mikeymikey,2007-09-10 15:49:00,376,"Is your hands still shaking ?  Are you still thinking about the fish?  Can't wait to go back tonight?    I've also had great luck at the Port Credit.  Btw... what is a shock leader?  Also, I am interested fishing gears used.  Thank you"
111998,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-10 16:07:00,698,"Hi Mikey, here's some info I found about Shock Leaders from another site  Shock Leaders.  Shock leaders were first used by Sea Anglers and adopted to Carp fishing by the first Anglers to start to fish for Carp at distance.  They consist of a heavier breaking strain Monofilament line usually between 18- 25 lb and enable us to launch heavy weights long distances with the aid of large test curve rods which could not be compressed with normal main line.  There are many knots that may be used to join 2 lines together here below are the 5 most common, starting with my all time favourite the "" Mahin knot "" this knot may seem complicated to tie but believe me after a bit of practice you will have it off to a tee, when this knot is tied properly you will have a very strong conned shaped knot that will glide through your rod rings with great ease. I would suggest you try them all however and see which one suits you and your type of fishing. Which ever knot you choose you should always make sure that all the components below the knot can slide easily over the knot in the case of a break."
112003,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-10 16:15:00,0,Congrats on your first Salmon and a nice one at that!
112007,TJQ,2007-09-10 16:25:00,7806,"wow!!!  WHAT A FISH, AND WELL DESERVED!!  GOOD FOR YOU!!"
112019,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 16:52:00,7971," Hey there!  That was great info toronto angler found, I had no idea it started with carp.  Anyhow, because I used 20lb power pro line, there is no stretch in it.  This can be bad as it's possible to have a line break because of that.  When a line stretches, it's able to absorb some of the ""shock"" from a quick run.  Simply make a heavy mono or florocarbon leader and put it between the power pro and your lure and you have a shock leader.  I was using a 6'6"" Shimano rod with a Pfeluger spinning reel."
112042,Hedfish,2007-09-10 17:44:00,76, How long was your shock leader?
112046,MJL,2007-09-10 17:59:00,2427,"Congrats Cliff on your first salmon.  No doubt took many hours of work.  I have personally never found the need for shock leaders when pier fishing for salmon (with 3/4 cleos, 2oz buzzbombs, J-13) but if you're casting lures 150 yards into the distance, my carping friends rate tapered mono shock leaders very highly.  http://www.bristolangling.com/ProductDetai...4f-ee7ede5067b5"
112054,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 18:19:00,7971,"MJL - I wouldn't have put a shock leader on if I didn't have a break off just the other day on a run...not on the cast.  I am using a small 6'6"" rod, so the rod couldn't absorb a lot of the shock...who knows, probably a combination of that and drag set a bit to tight....I just figured I'd try this to see if I could minimize the shock on the 20lb power pro if the fish took a quick run.  I caught this guy at the location of my home carp swim...you know the area, so in order to try to control the fish and not have it hit the ""abundant structure"", I had to thumb the spool a lot to try and cut those runs short.  I'm just rambling here...LOL"
112075,xrap,2007-09-10 18:42:00,683,"ccmt, that's freaking awsome. I remember my first slamon. I couldn't even talk I was so excited, congrats man. And just if you don't mind me asking how much yards of power pro do you have on your spool. Because I could only fidn the ones that come 200 yards in a spool and Saturday night I got spooled!! And no my drag wasn't to loose. After it was on it's last few yards  i tried to tighten it up and just pull it in well it stopped for about 3 seconds and zipped off again. But now i got 400 yards of mono on my reel. I'd like to see him try again"
112087,fishnsled,2007-09-10 18:59:00,3520,"WTG Cliff!!  Let me guess, it was really on the glow in the dark Vibra Bat lure wasn't it......lol!  Congrats on you PB!  I'm sure you'll break that record very soon."
112124,gforce,2007-09-10 20:00:00,63,where abouts were you fishing?
112125,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-10 20:00:00,655,"There is nothing like the feeling of hitting a nice Chinook from shore eh?  Congrats on your first... I'm sure you will be a regular spoon chucker like the rest of us now  BTW when I use braid casting for kings, I also use a mono or fluoro leader... I learned my lesson years ago with a few less lures.  I use a 6' leader myself.  Good salmon fishing!  Aaron"
112173,Hedfish,2007-09-10 21:29:00,76,"Guys, how much test should be the leader used for a 20LB braided main line? What's the logic here?  Thanks!"
112181,Jeff R,2007-09-10 21:52:00,94,"WTG Cliff....first one is the toughest, but you'll be bringing them in like a fishing trawler soon enough...."
111861,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 02:50:00,7971,"Bly and I have been heading out to a shore spot nearby for the last little while to see about all this talk about staging salmon.  In preparation, I put a post up this past week about ""how the heck are you supposed to land these things"" after seeing a guy lose one.  I received a PM from someone (you know who you are) to call them, and we chatted for a few minutes...him giving me some tips on lures and retrieves at night.  Bly also went out (after I told her not to spend any money at the tackle shop) and went in search of a shock leader since we use power pro on our setups.   She ended up bringing something home...just one thing...and it becomes important later on.   After tonite, she's forgiven and gets a lot of credit for helping me land this thing!  Anyways, on to the story.  We got there at about 7pm and began throwing lure after lure.  I tried crank baits and spoons.  After spending all day yesterday casting for bass with bly and fishnsled, my arms started to get a bit tired.  We hadn't seen the salmon jumping as much tonight, so I figured I'd head home without a fish yet again.  Evening turned to dusk and most of the people who were there headed home.  I put on a new spoon and decided to throw that for a while.  At about 8:45pm, something slams my lure.  I'm of course lazy and I was sitting down at the time.  I haven't gotten from a sitting position to a standing position that fast in my whole life!!!  I immediately set the hook and begin fighting this fish!  I had hooked it about 70 feet from where I was sitting.  After about 5 seconds, the thing went on a MAMMOTH run going out to about 120 feet from where I was!!  I slowly and methodically brought the fish back to where the fight started...then ZIIIIIINNNNNGGG....back out there...only this time even further!!  Once again, I play the fish....bringing it closer and closer...and just when I think it's time to bring it in....off it goes one more time.  This time, not quite as far.  It's dark out and I keep saying ""come on...come to the surface...I gotta find out where this fish is!!!""  It kept heading towards some structure where lets just say, if it got on the wrong side of it, he would have been gone.  As the fish gets closer, we see a SPLASH on the other side of that structure.  My heart sank for a split second, and then my fish finally surfaced in front of bly, who was waiting with the net.  My trusty net girl does a professional job and gets it for me.  We bring it to shore and begin the measurements.  This is the BIGGEST fish, other than carp, that I have ever caught.  Carp fight amazingly, but they paled in comparison to this salmon.  Here it is...my first ever salmon...measuring in at 35"" and weighing 17 pounds 3 ounces.....    I look tired in this shot because...we'll I was pretty exhausted...LOL.  What a rush this was...my hands are still shaking and it was caught almost two hours ago...haha.  I couldn't fish immediately after...I had to have a smoke and sit down for a while...LOL.  Well, there's my big fish story...the one that didn't get away."
111862,pigeonfisher,2007-09-10 02:52:00,696,"Very nice!!!  You deserve it, Cliff..."
111863,fatherof3,2007-09-10 02:53:00,1769,wtg! congrats on your first
111864,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-10 02:54:00,698,Wow what a monster! Did you get the measurements? Since it's your biggest fish maybe you could get a replica mount of it.
111865,dustink,2007-09-10 02:54:00,526,"Congrats!!  Very cool, and worth stying up for.....  dk"
111866,wolfville,2007-09-10 03:00:00,396,Hmm....worth the wait and I can go to bed now.....Thanks Cliff....and I will give that salmon thing a try this year.
111868,Deano,2007-09-10 03:04:00,767,"Awesome fish, I keep saying that salmon gotta be the strongest fish I've ever caught. I know exactly how you feel. The power, the excitement, the exhaustion, and the incredible feeling that you just won one with the greatest. Enjoy, you'll never forget."
111870,Joey,2007-09-10 03:07:00,9122,"That's great Cliff, way to go and congrats  What a beauty.  So what was the one thing Bly bought?  A net?    Joey"

111883,glen,2007-09-10 03:42:00,2641,People say that when you hook a muskie then you are hooked on them.  I say the same thing happens with salmon.  Nice fish.
111886,Mike the Pike,2007-09-10 03:49:00,3421,Wow Cliff Congrats on your first ever Salmon.Ya you look tired man.But that fish was worth it.I haven't caught a salmon since 1981 when I was 16 and I caught an 11lb COHO back then on Lake O out of bronte.  Carole whats this the hubby outfished you?Nice job with the net  Has to happen one in awhile.  MTP
111887,ehg,2007-09-10 03:57:00,2666,"Shorefishing salmon at this time of year is a blast. Congrats on landing that fish. I've been spooled a few times, at the mouth of the Oshawa Creek south of Simcoe St.  Fastracs w/ diamond pattern and Glo-Cleo's worked well.  Congrats again,  ehg"

111896,Mark.O,2007-09-10 05:50:00,15,Woooah nice salmon man. What pound line were you using? I lost three salmon today...I think it has something to do with the lb of my line.

111901,SlowPoke,2007-09-10 08:35:00,2984," LOL Mike, some things will never change. Carole still has Cliff in the salmon department... she landed a 36""er from my boat in June http://i147.photobucket.com/albums/r307/Sl...te/DSC00940.jpg  Having said that, catching a Chinny from shore is like nothing else... darkness, obsticles, lighter equipment... from panic to euphoria in oh, about 20 minutes LOL!!!  Congrats Cliff, keep at it - probably another 2-3 weeks before the inbound herds thin out. -Brian"
