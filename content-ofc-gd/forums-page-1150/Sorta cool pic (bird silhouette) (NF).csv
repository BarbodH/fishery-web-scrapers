112209,Joey,2007-09-10 22:44:00,9122,"Saturday morning I was drinking my coffee and reading the paper and noticed a large smudge on my front bay window.  I was kind of ticked as I had just washed them the week before.  Upon closer inspection, It was the outline of a bird, wings extended.  I looked for the bird on the ground outside but nothing was there.  It must have hit the window pretty hard as you could see details of each individual breast and tail feather, an eye and beak and the outstreched wings.  I tried to get a half decent picture of it with different settings, and this is what turned out.  Kinda cool, hope he's okay.        Joey"
112247,Roy,2007-09-10 23:58:00,13728,What a COOL pic! I'll bet you I can tell you the last thing that went through that bird's mind when he hit the window.
112249,Deano,2007-09-11 00:00:00,767,"""I was kind of ticked as I had just washed them the week before.""  Apparently you cleaned them all too well. LOL He probably just knock himself out and then flew away when he woke. Pretty neat though."
112287,fatherof3,2007-09-11 01:30:00,1769,that is pretty neat

A hummingbird had his beak stuck in the screen a few weeks ago, that was weird.  But mostly they survive, unless it is a high speed hit.  Pam"

112377,Spiel,2007-09-11 09:35:00,9065,....Looks like the ghost of the bird that hit your window....lol. Pretty interesting.

112467,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 13:18:00,7971,Wow...that is pretty cool!! I edited the image a little...took the negative of that last pic and darkened it a little.  It may be a little easier to see this way....
