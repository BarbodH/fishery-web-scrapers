111246,irishfield,2007-09-07 20:36:00,26272,"Thanks for your comments everyone. Just hope that some day that the little micochip in the back of your brain that stored this story might pop up a red flag for you one day.  Without any intention of being rude,...For those that keep plugging ""always wear your PFD that's the rule in our family,etc, etc""...... Don't fool yourself ! Part of why I shared this story is that's the way I've operated since the first kid was born 24 years ago. Long before a PFD was ""cool""! We used to slap a life jacket on our son when he was about three years old and tie him to a tree in Kelso Park, in Milton, to fish the reservoir. People used to go by and make rude comments that we were treating the kid like a dog and I used to tell them off and that it was better than a drowning!  I spent most of last night going thru my entire digital picture albums of holidays and all our photo albums and yep....there's not one picture of our son and two daughters in a boat without a lifejacket on. Heck in most I even have one on to set the example.....even the last camping trip at Finlayson PP in 2004 with my daughter and myself both standing on the dock with our days catch wearing out bright yellow PFD's.  Now like anything in this world, drop you kid off somewhere and turn your back. Five 19 to 22 year old young adults out for fun, hot weather and well you know the result.  Thanks and hope I've got you all thinking,  Wayne"
111249,motv8tr,2007-09-07 20:40:00,2587,"Hey Wayne, glad everything turned out ok, and I trust Leah's heart is beating again along with yours.  That sure was one heck of a wake up call for the kids...likely wont do that again.  Hope you guys have been enjoying your time up north otherwise.  Maureen"
111252,fishnsled,2007-09-07 20:42:00,3520,Glad to hear there was a happy ending to this adventure.  Thanks for sharing and I hope the canoes are there when you go to get them.
111259,camillj,2007-09-07 21:07:00,1988,Glad things worked out Wayne ... I have had a few 'experiences' and cant agree more about the communications aspect ... the thing is ... today at C.T you can pick up a pair or radios with 26km reach for under $100 bucks ... they work off of rechargeable AA batteries ... I always carry 4 of them to distribute to the gang ... and YES they can be life svers (literally) ... a little tip ... I tie each one up in a plastic (sandwich) baggie so even if they get wet they still work ... and float ... and the sound works just fine right through the baggie ...  Just make sure every one knows what channel to key in on ....
111288,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-07 23:12:00,2585,wow scary stuff!!!  Im very glad everything utrned out ok.  just goes to show you how you can never be totally safe and you cna never be totally prepared.  certainly an event that you all will never forget.  CHeers!
111304,Clampet,2007-09-08 01:03:00,1947,"Glad to hear ya made it out.  Even if it was by the skin of your teeth.  I know that feeling when you you see those big waves.  All of a sudden it ain't fun anymore.  Well, like you said, Satellite phones might make a lot of difference in the outcome."
111334,cisco,2007-09-08 03:01:00,597,"Thank heavens everyone made out OK Wayne. Temagami Lake has always been a bad mistress. Although you folks have only been up there a short time, the lake has already shown its dark side a coupla times.  Always have a backup plan pending weather.  Never have to be somewhere, 'weather be darned'.  You're a smart man and boatsman. Good job Wayne on gettin' the job done!  NEVER let that place lull you into a state of complacency. All the stories I've been told from guides/trappers/hunters/MNR about that place leads to the conclusion that Temagami Lake is within a wilderness region that can be a real killer on occasion.  Take care bud."
112477,lew,2007-09-11 13:41:00,12767,"Wayne, I was away for awhile and missed this thread, and just found it today while catching up on old news.  Wow, that's a scary story, but fortunately it had a happy and safe ending to it, but it sure could have gone the other way if you, and everybody else involved, hadn't done everything just right. Sorta makes you think somebody really IS looking over our shoulder sometimes, and steering us in the right direction, doesn't it ??  I enjoy fishing alone, and often it's in very nasty weather and very often it's after dark, but I NEVER wear a PFD.....until this year. I was fishing the West Arm of Nippissing alone last month in extremely rough water and decided maybe I should wear a PFD, and instantely felt safer and more comfortable, and since then I always  wear it when things get nasty.  Just last Friday I crossed all of Stoney Lake, then ran the entire length of Clear Lake alone in 50 - 60 KPH winds and 3-4' waves, and the 1st thing I did was don my PFD  Thanks for the reminder Wayne, and maybe now, more of us will think smarter  too after reading your post.  From one Dad to another, I know how you felt."
112510,Tacklebuster,2007-09-11 15:20:00,303,"Thank goodness all turned out well, and that you followed your intuition, which usually turns out to be the best decision."
112570,dannyboy,2007-09-11 17:40:00,367,"Hi Wayne: Glad to hear everyone ended up safe. I appreciate you sharing your experience, it brings a clearer perspective on how with nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are only consequences.  Dan"
112583,Spiel,2007-09-11 18:22:00,9065,.....Brutal! It could have gone tragic real fast. I'm glad everyone is okay and certainly much wiser for the experience.
111048,ccmtcanada,2007-09-07 11:31:00,7971,Wow Wayne...reading this scared the crap out of me...I can only imagine what you guys were going through.  I was picturing Leah jumping into the water...chaos all around.  I'm very happy and relieved that everyone was ok after this ordeal.
111063,BITEME,2007-09-07 12:01:00,1969,"REALLY GLAD TO SEE THIS WORKED OUT WELL FOR ALL!!!!! Very important life lesson I,m quite sure"
111069,Sinker,2007-09-07 12:15:00,8692,"Crazy story!  My kids will not get in a boat without their PFD's on......its just part of the whole boating deal. Even when we are out cruising in the 24 foooter, first thing is PFD's.  Before they set foot off the dock, they have them on. I no longer have to remind them, they just do it.  Maybe get that point across to yours as well. They will save your life!!!  I just can't believe they were out there with no life jackets....  .....never mind the sat/cellphones!!  Sinker"
111071,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-07 12:16:00,0,"I'm so glad everything worked out OK Wayne.  A parent's worse nightmare.  That big boat of yours whatever it cost you, has paid for itself already I'm sure in your mind.  Jim  ps. Glad to see you back Wayne."
111075,dsn,2007-09-07 12:31:00,1018,I'm glad evrything turned out ok. I guess we all should be like that eh? When we decided to meet someon make sure you meet them at the appointed time. And not be late. I'm usually an early person too when meeting anyone.
111084,Golfisher,2007-09-07 12:57:00,586,That is one scary story.  Something to mule over for sure.
111088,wuchikubo,2007-09-07 13:06:00,1114,"Wayne, Indeed a scary reminder of not to take Mother Nature for granted and to always caution on the safe side. I could feel the parental concerns from your post as I read them. And I'm definitely glad to hear that everyone is safe. The sat. phone is on my list now if I plan to go out of cell range for a trip.  Thanks again, be well.  Stan"
111092,ScarSnake,2007-09-07 13:17:00,20,"Glad it all worked out. A lesson they won't soon forget, and hopefully apply to other situations.  I was out canoing at Gurd Lake on Sunday, and nearly got tipped over when my gf had trouble keeping the canoe pointed into the waves (this was the day she decided she wanted to steer!).  I need to schedule these close calls for times when I have a PFD actually around my torso, and not under my ass."
111093,bowshep,2007-09-07 13:18:00,378,SuperDad and SuperMom. Respect. Peace Ken
111094,pigeonfisher,2007-09-07 13:19:00,696,Hell of a way to learn a lesson.  Glad it worked out OK.
111113,jedimaster,2007-09-07 14:14:00,3472,"Yah I gotta say. Everytime I go camping in a canoe, I leave an extra weather day. I won't do it any other way. Lifejackets are always on Kids AND Adults. There were many lessons to be learned. Over loaded canoes, in a rush, no communication with the person picking up, LIfe Jackets not on, no extra time for a fall back. So many bad things can happen canoeing.  A few years ago at Opeongo I took a group out with me and my son, as we were leaving the launch I pointed out a canoe with two adults, and I said look at those guys, they aren't wearing life jackets, and they don't even know how to paddle properly.  % days later when we returned to the Main Launch I found out both guys died 20 feet out from the dock the morning I pointed them out.  A year later my friend lost 3 friends and nearly two more canoeing in a river.  Canoes are extremly dangerous especially on big lakes.  I didn't read the other comments on this thread so I am probably saying something already said. Anyway a lesson learned thankfullly no one was hurt or killed."
111114,LeXXington,2007-09-07 14:15:00,1928,All I can say is wow.. the pit of my stomach dropped when reading this..  Glad all are ok and hopefully a little more aware what mother nature can do..  Sometimes she is nice and sometimes she can turn..
111120,Pete Maina,2007-09-07 14:34:00,213,"Wow. Glad it all worked out as it did.  As mentioned, Ma Nature can be brutal ... is to be respected.  Pete"
111135,mattyk,2007-09-07 15:03:00,2110,glad to hear things turned out ok in the end. Very scarry.
111138,tonyb,2007-09-07 15:17:00,1637,"Yikes! Glad to hear everyone is safe, but a scary moment indeed.  It's funny how we get complacent over time with things, yet 1 incident like that and you get snapped back to reality.  Safety is going to be on the forefront when I get my boat.  You want to go for a ride on my boat, sure...but you'll be wearing a lifejacket and will know where all the safety equipment is on board and how to operate it in case of emergency, no questions.  You should submit this story to Lund Wayne, not like they need the re-inforcement, but if it helps another family choose that boat over something 'cheaper' than you could very well be saving lives indirectly.  No other boat I've been on is as stable in rough water as a Lund with the IPS hulls.  Tony"
111145,SlowPoke,2007-09-07 15:27:00,2984,Most of us inspect our hulls and are reminded of our stupidity. When you inspect your hull it should remind you of your bravery. Wear it like a badge of honour. -Brian
111150,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-07 15:37:00,655,"I am glad to hear everything turned out well Wayne.  Thank you for sharing your experience, it is a good reminder for everyone how mother nature can turn ugly very quickly.  I bet you kissed your big Lund when you made it back to the dock safely!  Be safe out there!  Aaron"
111152,Dano,2007-09-07 15:49:00,719,"Glad it all turned out Ok, but jeez Wayne, you missed the perfect opportunity to do some gas money negotiating BEFORE you dragged their wet butts out of the lake....sheesh...."
111154,bigbuck,2007-09-07 15:52:00,2449,"W O W ! ! ! I was blown away reading this. Irish, thank everything that's holy to you for everyone making it back safely. All that have read this have learned a lesson or two regarding canoeing and boating in general, not to mention those that were there. PFDs ARE important, it's not a silly regulation, it's common freaking sense. I'm not a conoeing expert by no means, I've only been in one about a dozen times, my knees can be sore, I'll wear the PFD. In a boat, I keep it nearby in calm water, if it's rough, it's on. Wow!"
111180,TJQ,2007-09-07 16:55:00,7806,Wayne.. i was up in whitefish bay.. and yes it was windy... we stayed a camp most of the day... im glad everything turned out alright!!  a good scare makes ya think!
111191,Squid,2007-09-07 17:18:00,1656,Good to hear that all turned out Ok Wayne.
111226,ecmilley,2007-09-07 19:03:00,2163,"A boat can always be replaced, just happy to hear everyone is safe and that you all learned a big lesson"
111228,tinbanger,2007-09-07 19:11:00,1028,"Wayne glad t0 hear everyones ok . Things happen fast out there just glad you were a little faster.  Welcome back , look forward to my baby Lund meeting the grandaddy on GBAY this fall  TB"
111232,canadianguy33,2007-09-07 19:42:00,121,"Wow!  Really glad to hear everything turned out okay.  I think tonyb hit the nail on the head when he said that people get complacent out on the water.  I'm not out on the water much these days, so when I am, the 'fear' is present, but I can see how all this went down.  Thanks for sharing."
111233,Handlebarz,2007-09-07 19:45:00,3790,thats some scary stuff Wayne glad to here everyone is safe.
111038,Whopper,2007-09-07 10:50:00,2174,"I'm glad everything worked out for everyone involved Wayne. It looks like your investment in the big boat already has payed dividends. Like Ron said material items can be replaced but our children ""ireplaceable"". I'm sure the bottom of the boat will always be a reminder.  Whopper"
111041,OhioFisherman,2007-09-07 11:00:00,6623,"4 Kids myself Wayne, I know how scarey that must have been. If the kids are ok then everything is!"
111047,Roy,2007-09-07 11:22:00,13728,"Wayne, I could feel the fright in Leah's whole self reading that story. I can't even imagine another outcome to that near miss. Another learning experience is right."
