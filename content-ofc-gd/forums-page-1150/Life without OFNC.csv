Went for emission test to learn that my Buick Regal needs new engine (blue smoke symptom). For 12 years old car with 250 k  this was not an option. Time to get something newer. It took couple  days to find what I’ve wanted and here it is:       Then computer problem, still working on it.  On a positive note we have new member of the family.       Finally after missing two fishing weekends everything went back to normal  Weekend report shortly."
