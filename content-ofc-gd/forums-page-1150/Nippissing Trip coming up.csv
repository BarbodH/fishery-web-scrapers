112589,rob v,2007-09-11 18:30:00,535,Our annual Nippissing trip is coming (not nearly fast enough) up on thanks giving weekend.  Something I look forward to all year.    Hopefully the weather and fishing gods are friendly !  Anyone know of any message boards that I can visit (besides this one) where reports on local & up to date fishing conditions on Nippissing are posted ?  Thanks.
