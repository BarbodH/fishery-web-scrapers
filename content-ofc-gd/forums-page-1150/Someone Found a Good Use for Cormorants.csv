But here in Ontario, I say – get rid of them and $crew P3TA and all the good doers. I wonder why “friends of trees”, etc are not complaining about the damage the birds are doing.  http://phototravels.net/japan/ukai-cormorant-fishing.html  carp-starter"
111163,dsn,2007-09-07 16:24:00,1018,I don't get it.  whats the purpose of this? In return they take the fish out of the birds stomach and eat what the birds ate?  Yuck!! Is that the point of all this?  dsn
111165,highdrifter,2007-09-07 16:25:00,2534,That is soo kewl!  Makes me wonder how fast I can domesticate one...  I need a new method to make bait!  Thanx for sharing!  HD
111170,Pigeontroller,2007-09-07 16:31:00,2793,They should just save themselves the trouble and eat the Cormorants!
111181,Whopper,2007-09-07 16:57:00,2174,Oh I get it! soak them in kerosene and use them for light/heat
111188,wuchikubo,2007-09-07 17:08:00,1114,"Been there, watched it. It's a blast to watch. To those grossed out, well, it's like your hunting dog bringing back the bird you just shot. The cormorant doesn't eat the fish, it holds it in it's mouth as the Ukai fishermen have a special ring around the neck to prevent them from swallowing the tasty smelt like fish. The cormorants nip an area to stop the fish and to get a bit of the fatty oil in them. The fish have a sweet oil in them that make them so popular. Deep fried or BBQ roasted,  ummm  yummy memories.  Perfect scenario for the term work smarter not harder! Get the birds to locate and catch the fish for you!  Thanks"

111276,BryonG,2007-09-07 22:12:00,52,Wow!! Thats a blast from the past.I remember it too.
111278,Beats,2007-09-07 22:23:00,543,Ive seen this fishing in a few documentaries on Tv over the years and have always remembered it since its so unusual.  A particular skill is needed to get the birds back to the boat right after they catch a fish because after a while the birds learn that if they are fast neough they can manage to swallow the smaller fish before being pulled back to the boat.
111283,fishindevil,2007-09-07 23:00:00,6254,"ALL CORMORANTS SHOULD BE KILLED.  .....i try to hit as many as i can when im on lake ontario  ,caught one while fishing once,its too bad he was hooked too deep...poor little guy.  .lol..lol..lol   kill them all ....."
112452,Riparian,2007-09-11 13:00:00,269,I dont think all commorants deserve to die... but a respective cull is definitly in order.

112506,Tacklebuster,2007-09-11 15:14:00,303,"Looks very interesting, National Geographic material, I just don't understand why they don't use nets to scoop up the fish.  Is it just about tradition, or is there another reason?"
112553,wuchikubo,2007-09-11 17:02:00,1114, Although I believe it's mostly for tradition but if you think about the overall scheme of things there are benefits to this. There is a good balance of natural resource management here that could be learned elsewhere in the world.  If all the fishermen were out with gill nets then there would be overfishing without a doubt. Local area would suffer in the long run as the fish would probably not be able to rebound. It gives the fish population a chance to as the cormorant can only catch so many as the cormorants are on a type of leash. It also provides the local area a tourist attraction providing more money to the economy. I don't think it would be as interesting a picture to have a guy scooping up fish from a net. (personal opinion only) Cormorants population are then regulated by the fishermen and government.  It's all about balance.
