112605,mattyk,2007-09-11 19:13:00,2110,"Im planning on picking up my first trolling motor ever and im going with a minn kota. In general how long will the battery last during your day of fishing with average use?  I am planning on buying a Bass pro shops deep cycle marine battery, any feed back about these batteries? Thanks."
112607,OhioFisherman,2007-09-11 19:20:00,6623,"On a medium setting like 3 out of 5 all day maybe some juice for the next, depends on the motor, #`s of thrust and the size of the battery, lol and wind. I have a 52 pound thrust bow mount 12 volt. I did carry a spare battery."
112611,Gerry,2007-09-11 19:26:00,257,"It really depends on a lot of things like the size of your boat, whether your getting a 12, 24 or 36 volt unit, how high does your boat sit in the water (higher boats are more affected by the wind), and of course the battery/batteries selection. Ask the guys at BassPro for advice and have this info with you."
112613,Sinker,2007-09-11 19:35:00,8692,I can go all day no prob in a moderate wind with a 55pd on a 16 foot deep and wide. My batteries aren't the big ones either.  Sinker
112614,mattyk,2007-09-11 19:41:00,2110,i have a 14.5ft tinny with 15 hp. Im looking to pick up a 36 or 40lb thrust 12v unit.
112621,OhioFisherman,2007-09-11 20:04:00,6623,"Matty that motor 36 or 40 should be fine for that boat, now bow or tiller?"
112624,Raf,2007-09-11 20:06:00,3495,You should be fine for a full day no problem..
112628,ranger520vx,2007-09-11 20:09:00,164,"Get yourself a battery classified as ""GROUP 31"". They are the largest by size and have most reserve minutes and cranking amps."
112638,Whopper,2007-09-11 20:41:00,2174,"Matt get the 40lb if you can, the bigger won't have to work as hard and a battery should last you at least a day depending on the wind speed."
112661,mattyk,2007-09-11 21:14:00,2110,thanks for all the feedback guys!
112681,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 22:09:00,7971,"I just bought the Minnkota 30 lb thrust and used it on brickNblock's 14 foot tinny the other weekend.  We were out for about 6 hours...using it most of the time from medium to high speed.  When I got home and tested the battery, I still had about 50% charge on the battery.   The battery I bought was Canadian Tire's Nautilus deep cycle....the biggest one they had ($109).  The conditions were about 15km/h winds and it was a river...so we were going against the current quite a bit.  Good luck!"
