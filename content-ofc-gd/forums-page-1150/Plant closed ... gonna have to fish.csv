112114,ccmtcanada,2007-09-10 19:36:00,7971,"Sorry to hear about the plant shut down....but happy to hear you seem to be looking forward to more fishing!!  Things will work out...they always do...in the meantime, there's nothing wrong with wetting a line or two.  Good luck! (with both fishing and job)."
112116,fatherof3,2007-09-10 19:38:00,1769,too bad about the job.hope you find something else in the mean time enjoy your fishing
112120,SlowPoke,2007-09-10 19:43:00,2984,"Sorry to hear about the job but on the bright side, this is the best time of year to unencumbered by work! Give UncleBuck a shout, he's in the Stoney Creek area. If he doesn't have an opening, he can probably have an ear out for you. Hopfully you don't find work tooo soon! -Brian"
112128,Squid,2007-09-10 20:02:00,1656,Send me a PM.
112140,Canuck2fan,2007-09-10 20:25:00,1444,"Sorry about the job being lost, but if you aren't careful it looks like you might be working way too soon just by casually posting it on here.....  Good luck with both the fishing and job search."
112161,Smokey,2007-09-10 20:54:00,1278,Sorry to hear about you loss of job. I hope another job comes your way quick but enjoy a bit of time for you in your time off.
112237,brifishrgy,2007-09-10 23:38:00,559,  That was the idea .. would rather fish between work then fish because of no work
112276,TJQ,2007-09-11 01:10:00,7806,Im sure things will work out..... till then....   FISH ON!!
112308,Canuck2fan,2007-09-11 02:28:00,1444," I figured that. Last year the place where I work had a fire, so we kind of shut down so I went from working 6 days a week to four. Everyone of my customers kept offering me full time work and couldn't wrap their minds around the fact that I wasn't interested due to the fact that it was steel season..... Although I must say being on salary helped as I didn't lose any pay LOL. I am finding it tough to resume working 6 days a week just as the steel season begins this year."
112355,holdfast,2007-09-11 05:16:00,1813,Lots of work here and they're crying for machinists.  Local paper here had a letter from a reader with a good Idea.  The government train and (move grant) people out of work in the East that want to work.  Makes more sense to me than going outside the country.  Anyhow good luck and with your trade you'll do well soon enough.  Happy fishing
