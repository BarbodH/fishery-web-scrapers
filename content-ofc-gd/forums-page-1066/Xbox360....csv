174083,OhioFisherman,2008-03-20 13:40:00,6623,"We got a wi last week, pretty cool if your into that kind of thing."

174090,SlowPoke,2008-03-20 13:49:00,2984,"Picked up a Wii for the kids this week, haven't tried it yet but my wife loves it. Gerritt, do you remember the old Redneck Rampage PC games? They were pretty fun. There was also another version where the deer shot back...can't remember the name."
174091,BillM,2008-03-20 13:49:00,17367,Stoty: I play COD4 quite a bit online   Excellent game.  Infinity Ward is supposedly coming out with new maps in the spring sometime...  Really looking forward to that!

174179,Deano,2008-03-20 17:11:00,767,"I've just completed Burnout Paradise, awesome game for anyone who likes racing/driving/crashing games. Just have a few online challenges left. My son likes COD4, just uploaded the new update for it today actually. He also like Rock Band.  The game where the deer hunt the people was Deer Avenger, I use to play it on the computer years ago, pretty funny comments in that game.  PSN ID - simplyred4x4"
174185,walleyejigger,2008-03-20 17:25:00,876,"had my ps3 for little over 2 weeks now and i'm addicted, too bad games are so expensive, i've got NHL2k8 and medal of honor airborne, i enjoy them both  REALLY lookin forward to GTA4  PSN id powergrub, but i'm not hooked up very often"
174202,Stoty,2008-03-20 18:08:00,2910,"Ya GTA4, is going to be great. I should probably get my name on a list now, or else I wont be able to get it!  Feel free to add me as well (on PSN id = STOTY)"
174241,maybe,2008-03-20 19:48:00,307," Loved Redneck Rampage, but hadn't heard of the deer thing til I just went googling.  Did you mean Deer Avenger?  Bambo the widow goes to teach a lesson to those nasty hunters who offed his girlfriend?"
174249,JohnF,2008-03-20 20:07:00,3494," No kidding! My son gave me that one for Christmas (I've finished 1, 2 & 3) but I need a better video card to play it properly. I'm due for a new desktop anyway so it can wait till I get that running. In the meantime Matt gave me his old XBox with a bunch of action games. They'll keep me occupied for as much time as I can spare. I'm kinda partial to Sega racing & James Bond right now. I've almost learned to actually make the Mustang stay on the track while shifting gears manually.  Mebbe I should look for the Rapala game. Is there an XBox version of it?  JF"
174297,Gerritt,2008-03-20 23:30:00,6129,  LOL Yeah man!! that game was awesome!! some of the stuff they did were howls!  G
