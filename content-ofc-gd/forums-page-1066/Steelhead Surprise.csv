174060,silverstreak,2008-03-20 13:08:00,146,Was out the other day when I see a slight movement just downstream from me. Next thing I know this large deer jumps down from the high bank and swims to the other shore. Pretty cool end to a great day of fishing.

I suspect any fish that were in the area may have been a little spooked if it splashed a lot.  I was fishing an area last spring, when a dog jumped in the water....about 2 seconds later, I saw about 20 steelhead zoom by me...LOL."
