174184,ChrisK,2008-03-20 17:21:00,2772,Nice set up...Since that pick I had an adapter made for the grinder so it would mate up with my electric drill. Does speed up the process big time and saves alot wear and tear on you elbows and shoulders.
174292,sonny,2008-03-20 23:04:00,511,"  Hmm....someone who might know what they are talking about,,,,"
173447,pikehunter,2008-03-19 09:39:00,1659,"Personal decision on whether one desires to eat anything at all. Sure the fish from some bodies of water are not too healthy to eat but what really is? Fast foods are out and all the prepackaged processed foods are just nothing but poison in a box. Holy crap! you can't even eat bean sprouts, lettuce. How many other so called healthy foods have been pulled off the store shelves because it was toxic? And where do you think all that sewage sludge ends up????? Yep right on the farmers crops, that crap you flushed down the toilet last month is on the celery you ate yesterday. And that Chinese made toy your kid has in his mouth probably contains lead or some other toxin that it hasn't been tested for.  And oh yeah what about all the imported foods we get in the winter, not all comes from the southern U.S, a lot of it comes from Mexico, Peru, S. Africa, Chili and of course they have excellent trustworthy farming practices in those countries, gag gag. So no matter what you eat it carries the possibility that it too is contaminated. Even processed foods originating from N. America contain ingredients from some not too careful countries. And I haven't even hit on Americas favourite baseball park food, hot dogs!  We all worry too much and remember, believe nothing what you read and half of what you see. That goes for the both the good and bad reports. (Some may say what I just wrote here or this thread.) So don't fret over your neighbour chowing down on that salmon out of Lake O. or the walleye from the Grand or even the Pike out of the Montreal River everything is contaminated to a degree from something.  ....Oh yeah Hi Bosc and Fishmaster, how ya all doin'? See ya on the river. LOL Muddyriver."

173492,ch312,2008-03-19 12:02:00,1590," sounds good to me  ive been eating catfish, smallies, pickerel, and pike out of the river in the brantford area since i was a few years old. my dad and grandfather did the same. my grandfather is almost 80 years old and doing great and ive heard many stories from the days where you eat what you catch with catch and release being unheard of.  -people seem to feast on bass, pickerel, and perch from lake erie....where the grand flows into  -veggies are grown in soil thats full of animal feces and chemical fertilizers  -chickens sit in and often eat their own waste when picking up food. but that crispy skin tastes so good even though it was caked in crap before being slaughtered  -its difficult to breath in the summer in major cities due to smog  -people drink too much, smoke, do drugs, etc...   i dunno about you guys, but eating a few fish from the grand doesnt really have me concerned. we're all going to die sooner or later..."
173560,Fish Farmer,2008-03-19 14:45:00,2234,"You guys PH, Bosc, FM. STAY OFF my river, Thats my spot  . If you only new the politics on Tuna. Tuna, 5 times over the consumption in Mercury. Their ship to Japan, processed then shipped back for us to eat. I love that Mercury, makes me want to eat Walleye from the river and drink Coffee thats made from the water that comes from L. Ont. Gerritt, see you at the Awards Night. Spiel will be there March 25th. We'll have a few POP'S"
173575,Gerritt,2008-03-19 15:14:00,6129,sounds good! I will be there. Thanks for the reminder!  G
173653,ketchenany,2008-03-19 17:31:00,3229,drove down to the reserve the other day for smokes . . .    and these are safe?
173777,highdrifter,2008-03-19 21:36:00,2534," I always chuckle when I see that first picture.   There's no way a fish like that would survive if it had a conjoined fish in it's gill rakers.   It's simply two pike on a stringer, the smaller of the two with it's head stuck in the other's gills.  For the second, I've seen the same scenario happen many times if hatchery raised trout...  HD"
173785,highdrifter,2008-03-19 21:51:00,2534," I conquer.  I've read studies on the subject.  Chili, among other countries, has very lax policies on pesticide and fertalilzer use..  Makes you wanna cringe doesn't it??"

173995,livinisfishin,2008-03-20 06:16:00,661,"I have no idea where the grand river is and i have never even heard of it. So say I never even came on this website and read this article and eventually found out about the grand and fished it and caught a walleye and decided to eat it, as long as it looked healthy i would have had no idea and probably would have just been carrying on with my life unless i got sick....point being i would have just been better off not knowing."

174047,ch312,2008-03-20 12:44:00,1590,you need to rig something up like my setup for grinding alot of meat  
173137,Jen,2008-03-18 19:19:00,833," When you think about it......................................................................................................................  I had a lot more to say however decided to go with Roy on this one.  There are so many things that are killing us everyday, from the food we eat to the air we breath... To get a small amount of pleasure from the simple task of catching fish and then putting them on the table really outweighs the risks.  All the propoganda, all the political agendas, all the reasons not to fish or keep what you catch aside, life is what you make it and if we worried about absolutely everything than it wouldn't be a very happy place.  We are all here because we enjoy FISHING -  I said this a long time ago, it isn't about catching the fish, the biggest fish, or putting food on the table, what it is about for each and every one of us is different however in the same thought it is bigger than anyone can explain.  The statistics are what they are... the rest is ours to enjoy!"
173153,solopaddler,2008-03-18 19:48:00,8605,Hey guys here's a couple of fish I pulled out of the Grand recently:        What'ya think is this bad?          
173178,Jen,2008-03-18 20:45:00,833,Neat Pictures... weird how nature works!  We found disformed frogs in the pond behind our cottage for years just outside of Owen Sound in Oliphant... I always thought the animal that survived like that was pretty special as they beat the odd s.
173180,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 20:51:00,981,"How'd they taste solo?  J/K  Dang, that pike is a score - double the meat in one catch!!!  Lol.  That's crazy.   Please don't eat any two-headed or double bodied fish anyone."
173263,Gerritt,2008-03-19 00:06:00,6129,"Ok,  I will post some links to info on the Grand River please feel free to read them and smoke your crack while your at it if your so inclined....  Some of these links will be informational, others will be studies and some will just be interesting. Please view each to be as such. Yes you will be required to READ if you are able... no there will not be a test afterwards and there are no Coles notes. PS... Facebook cheating is forbidden and will result in expulsion.  Also understand I dont hate the Grand I fish it, I am just sharing information that I have garnered on the resource. I am sorry if you take exception to this and If you dont like my conclusion that is fine.. base your own hypothesis on the subjective and continue to ignore the facts.  Seeing as how I grew up less then ten minutes from it banks and pretty much learned how to fish there I have collected some interesting articles over the years and have based my choice on not consuming fish from the Grand River based on such. What you and your family put in your mouths is purely your choice.. I am not trying to change that, I an just trying to show you that things are not always what they seem.  Here is some of the information available... I emphasize some because there is ALOT of info available on the Grand River.. and I Just dont have the time to do the research for you. For those of you that can read, please research it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  Will I continue to fish the Grand River? of course! Will I consume a fish from the Grand River... not with your mouth and someone else chewing.  Enjoy the read.

172677,TAH,2008-03-17 20:24:00,133,"yes I was there also on Saturday afternoon, about 10 fisherman fishing."
172684,Gerritt,2008-03-17 20:46:00,6129,"The Grand can produce a mixed bag of fish, and can be productive. But the dam is not the only place you can wet a line, there are thousands of shore / wader spots to fish between the dam and York..  One word of caution though... it is Ontario's third most polluted river according to government studies and only gets worse as it heads towards Dunnville and empties into Lake Erie. Sewage, farm runoff and fertilizers appear to be the main culprits. It is only superseded by two Toronto rivers...  Keeping fish from the river for consumption is definably not advisable knowing this information and would be foolhardy.  Gerritt."
172711,Fishmaster,2008-03-17 21:56:00,920,90% of guys there are targeting fish that are outa season ...Walleye Closed Trout Closed ...as for the river being not safe to eat fish your on crack buddie ..keep reading your books ..
172714,Gerritt,2008-03-17 22:08:00,6129,  Maybe that is the problem.... I do read.  G

172723,Gerritt,2008-03-17 22:32:00,6129,Just one of many Pinch... but yes that is the one I referenced to in my earlier post.  Guess Environment Canada needs to read less books too......   G
172724,Fishmaster,2008-03-17 22:37:00,920,Maybe you need to stop reading and sitting around the computer and go fishing ...

172784,danbouck,2008-03-18 00:45:00,4380,Last year I kept a few bass from the Grand (Between Cambridge and Paris) and they were the best tasting bass I had ever eaten. Mind you I was very hungry
172804,steverowbotham,2008-03-18 01:20:00,1800, bass dont taste good
172814,Gerritt,2008-03-18 01:35:00,6129,  Thats because they were marinated in the Grand River.... called raw sewage my friend LOL!  If you want a delicacy.. try Carp from the Don River.... Even better with more marination!   G
172817,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 01:40:00,2540," isn't that the pot calling the kettle black lol......raw sewage....lol....Gerrit you're from the Hammer, you should know all about sewage in the water...."

I am in Hamilton and grew up in Mount Hope and have Fished the Grand more times then I can count...  as it is local to me... having said that there is still no way I would have a grand river fish on my plate.

172827,Gerritt,2008-03-18 01:54:00,6129,  LOL! Probably better off! (shudder at the thought)  For some reason the fish on The Simpsons comes to mind lol  PS. My intent of my original post was to help someone that wanted to fish the Grand.... it was in no way meant to prevent the loss in sales on a couple dozen worms...  G
172831,fishing n autograph,2008-03-18 01:58:00,2540,"don't worry, i'll be fishin all over the grand this year anyway...love some of the ponds up this way"
172836,pikehunter,2008-03-18 02:01:00,1659,"After all that has been said I do eat the occasional eye from the Grand, the lower Grand. As for the local harbour I have never eaten anything from there, yet. Many people do though and they seem to be in decent health, at least they aren't glowing green anyway.  I also enjoy Lake Erie perch and they are healthier looking than the worm infested ones I have caught in Simcoe or Couchiching.  As for eating bass. What's wrong with them? I find that smallmouth taste fine the occasional time I have eaten them and my son says that he likes the taste of silver bass. Either is OK and are no worse tasting than sole or ocean perch and then many people love salmon, I don't. Personal preferences I guess."
172846,Garry2Rs,2008-03-18 02:09:00,1425,"Once you get down to Dunnville the fish in the Grand River are coming out of Lake Erie. I don't eat my catch anyway, but they are probably safe for women and children. garry2rs"

But reading the stuff I do about the Grand and having pretty much grown up on it.... it is in bad shape..  Hopefully it will continue to improve.  The Grand Flows into Erie and there are alot of resident fish.. alot of what I have read and studied suggests things get worse as you go down stream... given this may seem obvious.. But it is better to be informed... then the other possible consequences...  This watershed is in trouble, if it wasn't there would be no need for The Friends Of The Grand or the GRCA etc.... The development going on along its banks will only make this waterway worse... The above clubs know that this river is not well and are working to raise the funds needed to correct/help it along... but the river cannot sustain the amount of pollutants being put into it, it cannot naturally absorb them in the quantity they are being released in.... it is just not large enough...  I apologize that some here may not agree... but to them I say Google is your friend. To the naysayers I say ""would you consume fish directly from a sewage outflow?"" well... all poop travels downstream and the Grand is recognized for being poor by Environment Canada based on these facts.. sewage is pumped directly into the Grand. From what I can understand there have been multiple lawsuits against these plants and developers.. but to be honest.... it is just the cost of doing business for them.   G."
