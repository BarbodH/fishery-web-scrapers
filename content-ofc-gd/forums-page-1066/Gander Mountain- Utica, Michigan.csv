173460,huey graphite,2008-03-19 10:37:00,362,"I'm in the area this week for work and plan to stop in on my way home. Anyone been there? Can I expect to find gear at better prices than in Canada. Just to avoid any backlash, until now in my 30 years of purchasing gear.....100% of my purchases have been at Canadian retailers.  Thanks in advance.  HG"
173462,Terry,2008-03-19 10:39:00,14456,yes great prices on most stuff...spend spend spend
173497,John,2008-03-19 12:20:00,2956,Haven't been to that one but go to the one in Watertown NY once in a while. Definitely worth a look around.
173503,Jeff R,2008-03-19 12:44:00,94,"Never been to that one Huey, usually shop the Port Huron one. I have found that there lures and soft plastics are pretty much the same price as up here. The past couple of times I've been there, there was good deals on rods and reels. The Gander Mountain Guide Series (tackle or clothing) that I have purchased, is great stuff. Have you tried checking their online fliers? ..They also usually have a bunch of instore sales going on...biggest difference is the 6% sales tax, and no duty for under 450 (per person), and 48 hrs to 6 days...makes for big savings...Happy Shopping"
173514,Bly,2008-03-19 13:06:00,1556,"Morning Huey.  Been to Gander Mountain many times, Port Huron and Lansing area locations.  The body baits I purchase there are usually $2-$3 cheaper vs. here and often have additional colors/patterns.  At Christmas time we loaded up on trout supplies and a few others things. saved around 40% (Lansing area location).  As Jeff mentioned, their private label is Guide Series (the GS reels are made my Pflueger) and I have been happy with any GS merchandise I have bought. With the dollar right now, you should do very well.  Just a heads up.....this past weekend, Port Huron crossing, parents were charged to convert their money back into US....they had never had to pay a fee before.  Have a great week and have fun shopping!!"
173518,Jeff R,2008-03-19 13:23:00,94," That bites, they did that to my g/f once, think it was right around the time were up 6 or 7 cents on the U.S dollar. We have started stopping at PT Edward Casino to do the exchange (coming or going). Have found them to have most up to date rates.. even manage to avoid tempation once in awhile....  ... Hope that helps for next time Bly"
173532,Bly,2008-03-19 13:50:00,1556,  Thanks Jeff...will pass that along.
173567,redfin,2008-03-19 14:58:00,79,"Hi, I was at the Watertown store last week...very good price for the fishing stuff.

173832,taper,2008-03-19 23:03:00,611,If your into trolling with inline boards the Offshore brand are about half price compared to here in Canada.
173935,Garyv,2008-03-20 02:37:00,547,"Go to the one in Port Huron Mich all the time.  Sometimes they have great deals, but like everywhere you have to shop.  For what it's worth there is also a Bass Pro Shop in Utica Michigan so have fun!!!"
