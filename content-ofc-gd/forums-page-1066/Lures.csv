172926,livinisfishin,2008-03-18 04:42:00,661,do the pink and purlple colored spinners and rapalas work her ein ontario?
172942,Spiel,2008-03-18 09:25:00,9065,"....Stats show most of them to be unemployed!   JK, sure all colours will work at one time or another. What, where and when?"
172946,Fishnwire,2008-03-18 10:09:00,983,"Occasionally, throwing something at them that they've never seen before is the ticket.  Best way to find out if they work is to try 'em."
172947,Terry,2008-03-18 10:18:00,14456,"for big walleye, purples have been the hot ticket for a couple of years I like purple worms under many water conditions......"
172952,Mike the Pike,2008-03-18 10:39:00,3421,Yes purple and Pink work very well just ask my 9 yr old son his favorite lure is a 3 inch Pink rapala x-rap.       These 3 fish caught on pink rapala X-Rap.     Pink X-Rap     Purple Yozuri  MTP
172968,tjsa,2008-03-18 12:04:00,1578,"I mostly troll worm harnesses in summer for walleye, and hot pink can be a killer some days. In very clear lakes up here that have walleye, dark purple w/red beads will out-fish any other presentation so far as we have experienced."
172977,addict,2008-03-18 12:24:00,475,the pink and purple worm catches the wife every time.
172982,nofrills,2008-03-18 12:40:00,89,"I hooked some nice pike on a HOT PINK Hawg Seeker jerkbait, and had a couple hits on a purple Depthmaster Jerkbait. They work."
172992,duber,2008-03-18 13:03:00,220,Pink white and blue is my goto colour on spinners and a purple crankbait can be hot on the BoQ in the spring and fall. So I would say yah those colours work here in Ontario.

173024,bramptonjerry,2008-03-18 14:27:00,132,use them all the time in Georgian bay for walleye and pike
173048,fishnsled,2008-03-18 15:06:00,3520, Don't forget about the Blueberry muffin either mixed with a little AC DC.
173101,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-18 17:31:00,2050,"pink xrap works great in the thames river - downtown London for smallies....I've also had great success with the dollarama pink jerk bait in the thames!! lol  Also, the purple taildancer is a great walleye bait in the bay of quinte....  Cheers, UF"
173129,setomonkey,2008-03-18 19:06:00,872,I've met a bunch of steeheaders who swear by little pink trout worms. I'd get some but they are always sold out when I look for them at a tackle store...  Mike
173143,Stoty,2008-03-18 19:24:00,2910,Pink Fin-S-fish do wonders on jumbo perch
173155,Canuck2fan,2008-03-18 19:58:00,1444,I find pink roe and worms work just fine and I don't fish out of Ontario....  Purple used to work just fine for walleye too.
173157,Puckhead,2008-03-18 20:05:00,377,Lures come in different colours?
173166,fishindevil,2008-03-18 20:22:00,6254,"I make my own worm harnesses for eyes,and pink beads,with a silver purple indiana #5 blade,works great !!!! i have caught walleyes in clear,stained & gin-clear lakes with that exact combo,oh ya and pink and purple either one is a pretty darn good lake trout color as well,in the top 40ft of water,  so theres a few options for you,as you can see lots of us use pink and purple...and king salmon just love purple too...  .man the list goes on,just experiment with colors on & at different times of the day & in different conditions too !!!! cheers"
173187,Rich Clemens,2008-03-18 21:04:00,3131,My wife has had some pretty good success with Bass on the Rideau Water system using Spinnerbaits with a touch of purple in them.    We are presently in the market for a few more.  Maybe the fishing gods were smiling on here or just lucky or that was the 'color of the day'.  I'm sure she'll be throwing on some purple the next go-around up there.
173210,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-18 21:51:00,435,"Real men don't fish with pink baits....they fish with bubblegum baits  I also like the pink X-raps, I've had a lot of success with them...Ciscoes/Lake Herring or whatever you want to call them are a major forage for a lot of fish, and they have a pinkish purple shimmer when the light hits their scales. Also Gobey's have a purplish shimmer to them.  -Ben"
173279,Crazyhook,2008-03-19 00:37:00,1154,Love purple and Black spinnerbaits for musky... gold blades!  also pink plastic jerk baits are awesome for pike and bass
173291,irishfield,2008-03-19 00:55:00,26272,I'm hopin so...  ...and the scale is correct 350grams/12.5 ounces !
174497,singingdog,2008-03-21 14:04:00,1047,This one does. A spinnerbait version of the 'Dr Death' pattern. Walleye like it in clear water. 
174502,DANIMAL,2008-03-21 14:17:00,215,"I havent used much pink, except for steelhead and salmon, and it works great for them at times. But purple has become one of my confidence colours in clear water for almost all fish."
