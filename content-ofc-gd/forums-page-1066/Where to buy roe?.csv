173323,ccmtcanada,2008-03-19 01:33:00,7971,Call around to your local tackle stores.  Gagnon's in Oshawa sells it both loose as well as pre tied in sacs.
173333,Pinch,2008-03-19 01:43:00,231,"There's Angling Specialties in Toronto, the only one Ive been to is on Kennedy south of Steeles.  www.anglingspecialties.com"
173344,douG,2008-03-19 01:55:00,2693,Do these guys need a license to sell roe?  Where do they get the roe?  Do their fingers get dry and crack from handling the roe bags?  Inquiring minds need to know.
173346,huntervasili,2008-03-19 01:58:00,1604,I believe you need a permit to sell roe but I know they MUST buy hatchery eggs from licensed distributors
173360,douG,2008-03-19 02:12:00,2693,Thanks Mr. P.
173382,tibbs,2008-03-19 02:36:00,650,Thanks for the feedback! Does anyone know if Al Flaherty's has any?
173383,waterwolf,2008-03-19 02:40:00,556,"i'm pretty sure BPS has roe . don't know which direction you're heading ,, might be out of your way.  sorry ,  that's a negative on the fresh roe . i thought they had some in the big cooler at the front of the store but that's not the case ."
173516,kentooley,2008-03-19 13:09:00,208,Fish On Line....Jane just N of Lawrence on the E side.
173678,fishermccann,2008-03-19 18:14:00,655,"Rerries Bait and Tackel  on Kingston Rd.  at  Morningside in Scarborough  Has info about fishing spots as well A good guy, give him your business!"
173725,elusive,2008-03-19 19:46:00,77, Agreed!
173846,tibbs,2008-03-19 23:23:00,650,Thanks. I'll go to one of the stores soon.
173909,PAZE,2008-03-20 02:05:00,132,Pro Line at Blackcreek and Jane has all kinds of roe
173914,DanTheMan,2008-03-20 02:08:00,257,"LOL, When I read your post fast, I though I read something else you wanted to buy"
173920,danc,2008-03-20 02:21:00,4677,"In the old days we used to use yarn until we were lucky enough to catch a female.  My, have times changed."
173985,MJL,2008-03-20 04:38:00,2427,"In Toronto area -Angling Specialties -Lucky fish & Tackle -FishOnlineCanada  If you're heading east, stop in at Tightlines in Pickering.  The stuff they sell either tied up in bags or loose is dynamite.  I've Been purchasing my roe from there for the better part of a decade - I choose not to harvest fish unless I plan to eat them... I don't eat steelhead. The eggs tie up well, fish well and are still fishable if you leave them in a wading jacket pocket for a week unrefrigerated"
174000,ChrisK,2008-03-20 08:50:00,2772,"I would go with Dan on this one especially this time of year . Steelhead will take fly presentations readily wether it be yarnies, wigglers or a number of other patterns......Catch a couple of hens, throw them in the smoker(first remove roe )  and you should have enough roe for the next couple of seasons."
