173693,davew3,2008-03-19 18:54:00,430,"Hey folks,  years ago I bought these down in Florida.  They are made of styrofoam (?) and have a lead core. I have found them on BassPro Florida but not so much luck up here.   But before I order some, has anyone seen them up here ? These are great for when casting from shore as they can weigh up to one once.  Cast a mile.  Any info would be appreciated. Regards"
