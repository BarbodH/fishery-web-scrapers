173418,Paulus,2008-03-19 03:45:00,522,"Got a chance to finally wet a line this morning, looking for my first steelhead of the coming Spring season. Landed one within the first few minutes, but it was quiet after that. I got two pics of the fish while I was fighting it, then my camera died...doh!  At least it was good to figure out the cure for the serious blahs I was having   One fish is always better than no fish!!!      cheers!  p.-"
173442,solopaddler,2008-03-19 09:07:00,8605,"Nice going Paul! I hear you about the blahs, as mentioned yesterday stay in touch and ""maybe"" next week I can join you."
173444,Greencoachdog,2008-03-19 09:12:00,8163,Great pics!!!
173464,fatherof3,2008-03-19 10:45:00,1769,nice shots
173541,Bly,2008-03-19 14:03:00,1556, Amen to that!!  Good for you!  Think the blahs are worse than normal for many this year.
173546,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-19 14:14:00,160,"Lucky you, the only fishing I've been doing is in my head at my office cubical!!! lol Great Catch"
173728,silverstreak,2008-03-19 19:51:00,146,Always nice to get a couple drifts in before work. I always find it hard to leave though.
173787,ccmtcanada,2008-03-19 22:02:00,7971,"Great stuff Paulus!  Before catching a few steelies recently, I hadn't caught one since November....WAYYY too long!  I have a feeling the spring run will be a good one.  All this snow this winter will bring water levels back up to almost...if not normal."
173974,Paulus,2008-03-20 03:35:00,522," Let's hope so! Today's rain will have helped a lot, and hopefully the gray, ""dreary,"" weather continues... So dreary, so depressing... while everyone else is complaining about the rain I'll be   planning the next trip(s). ROFL!  Weather permitting, I should be able to provide a new report soon  p.-"
173976,Paulus,2008-03-20 03:36:00,522," For sure! I motivate myself by telling myself that I could've gone to work WITHOUT fishing first... It works, sort of...  But always better than a kick in the  lol!  p.-"
