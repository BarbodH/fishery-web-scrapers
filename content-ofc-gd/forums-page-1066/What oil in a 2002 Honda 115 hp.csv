173855,Bernie,2008-03-19 23:40:00,3190,Don't be afraid of the synthetic. I used 5w30 Mobil or Castrol in mine all year. I usually plunk my boat in the water as soon as the ice is gone and don't pull it until freeze up. The lower viscosity range helped in the colder water. If you want to you can also go back and forth with regular and synthetic.

173882,Another Canadian,2008-03-20 01:02:00,41,"FishOn,  I had a 2000 Honda 115.  Good motor until it hit the rock under the water.  BTW, there was a recall on the 2000 115/130's for the fuel injection system, not sure if it affected the 2002 model year.  I replaced it with a 2004 Honda 150  .  My Honda mechanic says basically what the previous posters say.  Good quality name brand oil, 10w30 or 5w30, with no hesitiation about using a synthetic (his preference).  He actually tells me to buy it on sale, and I just leave it in the boat for him.  AC"
173883,NANUK,2008-03-20 01:05:00,797,"As long the oil meets the manufacturer's specs/ratings and it has SAE/API seal you will be fine, I figure what they charge for ""Yamalube""(same as Honda oil) I might as well use the best, so I use Mobil-1 (10w-30) in my 4stk Yamaha outboard, Mobil-1 synthetic is compatible with conventional oil and its safe to use without an engine flush, don't forget to use a quality oil filter too. like WIX, K&N or Mobil-1."
173986,mrpike,2008-03-20 05:00:00,151,4 STROKE MARINE ENGINE OIL IS ( NOT ) THE SAME OIL AS AUTOMOBILE ENGINE OIL  NEVER USE AUTOMOBILE ENGINE OIL  FOR ANY 4 STROKE MARINE ENGINE THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERANT.  MARINE 4 STROKE OIL HAS A LOW FOAMING AGENT IN IT.  RPMs ARE MUCH HIGHER ON A MARINE ENGINE THEN A AUTOMOBILE ENGINE.  MARINE ENGINES RUN AT HIGHER RPMs FOR A LONGER TIME EVEN LONGER THEN MOTOR BIKE. ASK A MARINE DEALER OR MECHANIC ABOUT THIS.  IAM ONLY TELLING YOU WHAT I WAS TOLD BY A HONDA AND MECRURY  MECHANIC.
