Was quite a bumpy ride down though, the moguls(wind-drifts) were 2 ft. high at times, and hard as rock it seemed.  Holes drilled, couple of set lines in, and the jigging starts. Mike hard at it:  Gord, changing presentations yet again, had some follows but nothing would commit to them:  Forgot how darned big this lake is:  Full zoom, 10X, another angler south of us:  The shoreline we last fished about 15 yrs. ago, maybe more, the SE shoreline.  One of the moguls in between me and my bud's sled, it was almost 3 ft. high, pic does not do it justice.  Wind shaped snow on the lake.   Again, pic does not do it justice, both of those had troughs almost 2 ft. deep. Shoreline pic, I guess when the ice was forming, and when the winds were up, ice falls off of the cedars. It was in the shadow of the sun, so the pic is a bit blueish.   Oh, fish pictures, have some. Mike's 2nd one, first was released, a small one. This one is a keeper, and has been tagged, info on its way to the MNR.     Oh yeah, I gots a couple also, photo taken after landing them, caught 15 min. apart nears about 2:15-2:30 pm, lost 3 earlier in the day, 2 on the set line, one jigging.   We had a couple of guys who were just out bombing around on their machines come up to us from the south end, and in the time we were talking to them, thats when I landed my 2 fish. Our other bud had gone off to check out some holes other anglers north of us had been fishing, then left, and he landed 2 also.  Almost all the fish came out of 60-65 ft. of water for us this day, the ones our bud landed north of us were in almost 90 ft. of water.  Hope you enjoyed the report.  Tom"

174514,irishfield,2008-03-21 14:48:00,26272,Another NICE report Tom.... keep them coming !!
174517,johnnyb,2008-03-21 14:54:00,3413,Wow -- nice fish pics -- and the shot of the ice underneath the cedars is amazing!  I had a day out on the ice last year that had us catching fish every time we fired up the sleds and ran them around a bit....I wonder if there's something to that....
174521,Hookset,2008-03-21 15:09:00,367,Great report and very nice pics. Looked like a great day. I always wondered about snowmobiles and such moving the fish around too. I think there is something to that...   Hookset.
