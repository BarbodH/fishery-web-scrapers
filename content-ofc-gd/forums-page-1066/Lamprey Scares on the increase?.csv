174078,silverstreak,2008-03-20 13:35:00,146,Noticing a lot more Lamprey scarring(fresh and old) this season. Also noticing male fish looking a lot thinner. Anyone else seeing this?
174098,ccmtcanada,2008-03-20 14:03:00,7971,I haven't had any lamprey marks yet this year...but I'm sure I'll start seeing them if others are.
174111,BITEME,2008-03-20 14:19:00,1969,I agree lots coming in with scars more then i have seen in a long time seem to be quite a few coming in with the slimy guests as well good concrete stomping fixes the issue for the offending slimer though now if i only had more feet
174120,DANIMAL,2008-03-20 14:39:00,215,"I've been really noticing this in the past couple of years too. This past fall I cought a silver chinook with a lamprey hanging off it. It was about 10 lbs, fought like a bullhead and just tumbled down stream when I let it go."
174194,aniceguy,2008-03-20 17:54:00,1094,Havent noticed the smaller males as of yet but ask me in about 4 weeks after we are done lifting and handelling a 1000 plus of fish...  As for the lamprey theory is that the lamprey are coming in tight and feasting on fish that are in a staging phase
174380,fishindevil,2008-03-21 01:56:00,6254,"Yes for sure,all last summer fishing lake ontario,we seen tons of them,and alot still on the fish as we bring them overboard !!!!...i killed many with my fillet knife,and needle nose pliers....thats from cutbacks to the program,and if they dont start it up again it will be like the 80""s all over again where almost every fish had at least 1 scar,and i have seen some barley alive with up to 3 lamprays sucking them dry !!!!  thanks to the cutbacks they are really growing in population again  DAM !!!!!"
