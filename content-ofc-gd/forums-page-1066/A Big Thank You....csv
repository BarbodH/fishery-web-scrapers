174051,Beans,2008-03-20 12:51:00,3339,"Maureen is having trouble with her phone and computer so she asked me to post this:  Hi Maureen,  We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the fishing fundraiser and auction for our son Tyler. Whether you helped, donated, participated whatever your part we thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. Words cannot express our gratitude. So many doors have been opened for Tyler because of everyone's generosity. There are really no words to convey how we feel. We just wish that Tyler could show each and everyone of you the progress he has made over the last 4 years and that is because of generous people like yourselves. When Tyler comes to the lake he is really out of his element and it is very hard for him to stand there especially this year because the sun was so bright on the snow and he has sensory difficulties. We wish that Tyler could talk to each of you because he can now. He can answer some questions.  He is learning to read. He is counting and recognizing numbers to 100. He can say and recognize all the letters in the alphabet. He is learning to print and enjoys it. He has tried Karate. He plays bingo and board games with us. He sings in the shower. He is a great kid.  Thanks everyone,  Elisa and Terry French  "
