Any ideas of where i should start looking for a job, or does anybody know anyone who is hiring in the heating and cooling or natural gas trade?"
171719,Gerritt,2008-03-15 13:21:00,6129,Go west young man.....   Where about are you located? in my trade I deal with mechanical contractors daily....  G
171721,livinisfishin,2008-03-15 13:24:00,661,I live in orr lake. Between barrie and midland just in case you dont know where that is Gerrit
171722,Gerritt,2008-03-15 13:25:00,6129,Sorry.. I am in the GTA.. but I will keep an ear out for someone looking to take on another apprentice.  G
171723,livinisfishin,2008-03-15 13:27:00,661,Thanks Gerrit that would be awesome!
171738,bushart,2008-03-15 14:28:00,2628,Direct Energy is usually looking for good tradesmen--I would get on the phone to construction contractors in the refrigeration/sheet metal installation companies.  Barrie is a bigger centre and will probably pay better than Midland---Like I mentioned in your west question--gas fitter will lead to other trades.  On long shot trades--every once in a while you can get into some industrial manufacturers--little harder as most are unionized and apprenticeships usually go internal with seniority.  Bushart
