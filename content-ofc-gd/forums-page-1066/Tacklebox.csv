173947,kickingfrog,2008-03-20 02:47:00,8333,Seeing those pictures reminds me of years gone by with my brother. We would spend hours in the winter organizing and then re-organizing our tackle boxes. We would trade lures back and forth waiting for spring. Memory lane.
173949,Domi Fish,2008-03-20 02:49:00,46,"Looks good to me.  The only thing that tackle box is missing, is a couple packs of YUM tubes."
173962,kickingfrog,2008-03-20 03:00:00,8333,"OK so the pink tackle box is your girlfriend's, but the red teddy bear is yours right? Sorry couldn't help myself."
