174137,BillM,2008-03-20 15:40:00,17367,"I wouldn't worry to much about a pike.  As it was mentioned before a decent grip behind the gill plates usually calms them down pretty quick.   Keep your fingers away from the mouth, especially if it's still got the lure inside, they tend to thrash around pretty good when out of the water.  If you can, leave it in the net as was previously stated, pull the hooks then get a quick pic.  Good luck!!!  If I get some free time this weekend I might head down and try my luck again."
174166,maybe,2008-03-20 16:25:00,307,"Don't blame you for being nervous, Anton.  Getting near a thrashing toothy thing with hooks hanging off it isn't exactly a day at the spa.    Good luck!!  While we're on the subject of newbies and pike, I've been wondering - are those cradle nets like Lucky Strike makes actually useful?  Or are they one of those ""sounds good on paper, but they actually get in the road"" things?  Anyone have any experience either way?"
174192,forrest,2008-03-20 17:51:00,1032,A long set of needle nose pliers and a fishing glove will help keep the hooks out of your hands: http://www.jacksonlures.com/Commerce2/Glove.htm

173583,bbog,2008-03-19 15:30:00,665,As others have said make sure you are prepared to handle these toothy beasts! Last thing you want is a hook or tooth encounter while handling these slippery buggers that are known to be docile one moment then go berserk the next. Don't rush them.  Another vote for a Husky Jerk in Perch colour.  Good luck and have fun.
173591,redfin,2008-03-19 15:54:00,79,"I'm with bNb on this one.  I even won a tourny a few years back with just a jig/grub combo when other lures failed to produce.  Countless Northerns were caught while rippin a jig through the weeds pickerel fishing.  And they hit really hard even on a day that you think you aint gonna catch a thing.  My fav colours are white, motor oil, black/orange.  Good luck."
173603,Reef Runner,2008-03-19 16:09:00,981,"Good selection of baits there for ya Anton.  Check the hook ups section as I listed off a couple lures and tips that'll help out.  Proper release gear is key, as others had advised.  Anyone around the Harbour know of the conditions? Ice?  Best of luck to ya, and keep a look out for me as I might be around Saturday as well.

173615,Bitsmith2k,2008-03-19 16:28:00,396, damn that perchy.. stocked up on them last week at bps.. lol
173619,smbhunter,2008-03-19 16:33:00,186,"Lots of good lure choices mentioned already, but one of my personal favorites is a lipless crankbait. You only need two colurs, silver/blue and gold/black. When choosing one of these lures, I always find it better to go with one that has a smooth, shiny finish and a loud rattle. The smooth shiny finish will reflect more light and get the attention of a fish from a further distance. Other lure choices would be, x-raps and husky jerks, sizes 10 and 12. Med to large Williams Wabler or Whitefish can be productive. Plastic baits such as large grubs, creature type baits, Senko's, and swimbaits. If all else fails, you can try a medium to large size minnow on a hook.  Hope this helps and good luck."

Since I never handled a pike, I am sure I am in for a surprise! 99% of the fishing I do is catch and release. I have read all the posts and do hope I do get lucky and make it back home with all 10 fingers attached. lol"
173709,mikeymikey,2008-03-19 19:27:00,376,"Regarding a leader, I personally just use a wire leader but a lot of times after one fish I would get a kink and need to replace it... sure it's fairly cheap but cost adds up. So yesterday I went to BPS to buy some tools & supplies to build my own 80lb Seaguar but they didn't have any crimping tools or even the sleeves.  Is there any other local fishing stores around GTA that I can buy all the needed tools & supplies ?"

174092,Reef Runner,2008-03-20 13:54:00,981,"Hey Anton,  Pike are slimmy buggers and tend to swallow baits deep as they are aggressive predators; here's a few tips for handling them when without a net.  When handling a pike, as with any other fish, try to keep her in the water as much as possible.  Play her a bit until she's tired and bring her in parallel  to ya. Have all your release tools handy.  If its managable, grab the pike by the ""ears"" (on each side of the head, just above the gill plates), don't squeeze to tight.  Pop out the hook and release.  If she's a biggun', best to shore land her or tail grab.  If you must, slip a couple fingers under her gill plates but being sure you don't harrass the gills.  take her out of the water to take a quick pic supporting the fish with a hand underneath the tail.  I'm no pro, and I'll probably get ripped up by some overzealous members here, but I hope that helps you if you catch, handle and release a pike this weekend.  reefrunner"
174129,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-20 15:19:00,160," I intend to release all back, since this is going to be my first time, I am a little hesitant or rather afraid. I guess with enough experience I could get better at it handling the guy."
173293,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-19 00:55:00,160,"Hi Guys,  As I mentioned earlier, I am going to try my luck with Pike on Saturday (First time). I went by the C-Tire and got some lures which I (with my infinite experience with Pike gear, which = zero) thought should do the job. So here it is, am I in the right direction or have I lost it completely?  Thanks,  Anton  missing pict is Daredevle five diamond sppon...   "
173300,setomonkey,2008-03-19 01:00:00,872,"Spinners, spoons, looks good. The only thing I'd add is a crankbait like an X-Rap or Husky Jerk that you can twitch and retrieve erratically.  Good luck, Mike"
173302,huntervasili,2008-03-19 01:02:00,1604,  Ditto. I'd also suggest grabbing a couple body baits... I like the X-Raps and have gotten many pike on em. Good luck to ya

173312,danc,2008-03-19 01:22:00,4677,"I'd add a few Johnson Silver Minnows to my arsenal. They can be fished shallow and slow, and few lures will flash more brightly. Perfect for early season cold water Pike."
173315,muskymike,2008-03-19 01:25:00,772,"Also see if you can pick up a Rapala 6"" Silver and Black floater. They are always my fall back and never fail.  Good Luck Anton"
173329,FisherMike,2008-03-19 01:39:00,108,"If you can find some Bucher Baits or Jake Baits, definitely pick up a couple.  They are my favourite for catching big pike. Good Luck"
173330,tbayboy,2008-03-19 01:40:00,1497,I'll add my votes Perch pattern x-rap and johnson silver minnows.  Perchie caught me most of my TO harbour pike early last year (around this time) then the spoons when the weeds got a bit much for the jerk baits later on.
173331,GbayGiant,2008-03-19 01:41:00,1780,"I'm a jiggin guy, I'd add some big 5-7"" Gulp baits or just live bait (suckers) specially in the cold water."

173363,ehg,2008-03-19 02:12:00,2666,"Forget about the Toronto islands until May. It's all frozen there and doubt the ferries are running. Your best bet would be Frenchmans Bay at the foot of Liverpool Rd sounds like there is a bit of open water there.  The lures below are prime early spring/ late winter lures for Lake Ontario shoreline pike. Especially the clown x- rap, perch finish ain't bad either.  Had lotsa luck with Rapala husky jerk size 10 or 12's. The lure on this fish worked well for T.O pike last spring. Husky Jerk size 10. "
173419,Jigger,2008-03-19 03:47:00,1237,"with the water being as cold as it is, I would use bodybaits like the Husky Jerk or X-Rap. I've only fished that area a few times, so the local guys can correct me if I'm wrong. But I stay away from blade baits(spinners/spinnerbaits) until the ice is long gone from the bays. you're better off finding potentially good spots and working them real slow. Take your time and don't give up. Good luck."
173469,brickNblock,2008-03-19 11:07:00,598,"Anton.... Never go anywhere without a selection of jig heads in various weights and colours. A basic jig tipped with a 6"" white  twister tail has caught me several pike at the islands and they're deadly  and in-expensive. Silver spoons/Xraps are also very good at different times...must haves. Make sure you have a steel leader..w/quality snaps........You dont want to be dissapointed with a bite off. Man....I'm hoping your outing is successful. Really looking forward to your report. Be safe out there  Anton.....do you have any release tools? A FIRST pike can be intimidating....you dont want any hook harm to yourself or the fish. Jaw Spreaders-Needlenose pliers-Cutters for sure.  Best of luck fella! bNb"
