174215,Zamboni,2008-03-20 18:42:00,235,"The reason the kite type inflatables were banned is because of people getting seriously injured. They are extremely dangerous, read up on them at dedicated boating sites....users strictly following speed and other mfrs directions were hurt."
174218,BillM,2008-03-20 18:46:00,17367,"That looks like fun!!!  I wouldn't put a kid on there, but hell I'd get on one."
174220,KyleM,2008-03-20 18:58:00,218,"Zamboni, the people that will be using it are well aware of the dangers. I dont think it would fizz on someone who jumps a snowmobile 100 feet.  Ive done some reading on them, they wouldnt pick up my 240lbs fat arse anyhow."
174269,taper,2008-03-20 22:11:00,611,"Ive done some reading on them, they wouldnt pick up my 240lbs fat arse anyhow  Don't bet on it Kyle. Wind pressure can surprise ya."
174284,forrest,2008-03-20 22:38:00,1032,"It looks like it would lift 240lbs easy, it just needs the speed.  Were the Sevylor guys drunk when they came up with the idea to market that?  Check out the disclaimers about cross winds and kids under 10 years old.  The Sevylor lawyers must have had fits!  No doubt that insane snowmobile guys will like it.  forrest"
174285,ShaunB,2008-03-20 22:41:00,73,They are also extremely fun!!!
174294,mepps,2008-03-20 23:20:00,1301,crazy!
174307,Gerritt,2008-03-20 23:40:00,6129,I know Bernie's son was pretty banged up from one of those.... Hate to see this gift put your friend in the ground.  G
174320,OhioFisherman,2008-03-20 23:56:00,6623,"LOL, my ex-wife would look good on one!"
