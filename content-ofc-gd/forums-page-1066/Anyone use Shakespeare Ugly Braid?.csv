174392,silveradosheriff,2008-03-21 02:34:00,1025,Gotta experiment once in a while. Will be running Steath on one of my dispey rods this year.....

174401,PERCHER,2008-03-21 02:51:00,787,Try a spool of Fins or Pline.I have tried lots of different brands of braid and like these the best.Out of the two I really like the Fins the best.I run 6lb test Fins on a 7ft Shimano Compre medium light action rod with a Shimano Sedon 2500 rear drag reel.It makes for a really nice jigging set up.
174448,outllaw,2008-03-21 11:19:00,1232,i have some high seas braid and floro carbon. it seems to be very good.
174485,Jigatollah,2008-03-21 13:14:00,53,"I have used the Ugly braid now for 2 years and love it. Not only does it hold it's colour well, it doesn't fray like PP. PP has too many inconsistancies from one spool to another. One spool will work fine and the next spool can snap like weak mono. On my flipping sticks, I usually spool up with 50 lb ugly braid and when I used PP, I had to use 65-80 lb braid just to keep the line from breaking on hooksets."
