174168,Bernie,2008-03-20 16:43:00,3190,"Last year I replaced all the windows in my house with those expensive,  Double-pane, energy-efficient kind.  Yesterday, I got a call from the  Contractor who installed them.  He said that the windows had been installed  a whole year ago and I hadn't paid for them yet.  Helloooo?  Now just because I'm from Newfoundland doesn't mean that I  should be considered stupid.  So I told him just exactly what his fast- talking  sales guy had told ME last year... Namely, that in just ONE YEAR these  windows would pay for themselves.  'Hellloooo?' (I told him) 'It's been a year!' There was only silence at the  t'other end of the line, so I finally hung up.   He hasn't called back,  probably too embarrassed about forgetting the guarantee they made me.  Never underestimate a Newfoundlander."
