173644,forrest,2008-03-19 17:18:00,1032,"I sometimes find people selling lots of 10, 20 or even 50  lures, brand new, out of the package and have bought a bunch of Rapala's and Rat-L-Traps and my non-expert eye thinks they are new.  How do these items end up being released from the manufacturer without packaging?   forrest"

173660,John,2008-03-19 17:36:00,2956,"  Or they are perhaps knock offs. Check the hooks, sometimes great copies will have very poor quality hooks. I got burned a couple of years ago. I changed the hooks and they are great lures."
173752,OhioFisherman,2008-03-19 20:47:00,6623,"I have heard warnings here about teams shoplifting from stores here to stock their flea market activities, usually small sort of expensive stuff razor blades and such like 10 bucks a package, they sell for 5 to 7."
173775,fishindevil,2008-03-19 21:30:00,6254,They say up to %80 of fishing stuff on e-bay is stolen!!!!! incredible isnt it
173789,forrest,2008-03-19 22:05:00,1032,"Wow, everyone seems to be of the opinion (or knowledge) that the lures are either knock-offs or stolen.  Well one of the bare lots I did get was a set of 30 Rat-L-Traps ( a very easy package to copy).  I compared it to one of my originals; hooks and all looked authentic. 30 would be a lot to steal and this dealer sold a lot of boxed and un-boxed items.  perhaps a second look is in order?  forrest"
173854,richyb,2008-03-19 23:40:00,774,I know a local fishing store buys lures straight from the manufacturer in japan and he gets them cheaper  if he buys them unpackaged .. He gets a box of lures and a box of packaging and he packages them himself ... says it saves him quite a bit of money !!
173888,mbac31,2008-03-20 01:11:00,904,"Some people buy direct. I buy from 5 different sources that are the Manufactuer. I dont steal them. Companies have to jack up the price when adding hooks, packaging, advertising and so on. I get my baits without the frills. I dont take the box with me and it does not end up in a landfill."
173941,forrest,2008-03-20 02:41:00,1032,I think I am going to go with richyb and smalliefisher on this one.  thanks guys!  forrest
174023,pikehunter,2008-03-20 11:28:00,1659," Incredible, yes. Surprising, no."
174045,OhioFisherman,2008-03-20 12:34:00,6623,"Didn`t mean to imply it`s all stolen, just something to be aware of. Haven`t seen many knock offs here. Guy at the flea market with a regular both buys up the closeouts from store, pennies on the dollar I guess. Zoom 6 inch lizards are like 2.39 a pack here in stores, he usually has them for a buck, Rapalas 4 to 8 bucks in stores here 2.50 to 3.50 usually at his both. Mustad wide gap BLN hooks around 3 bucks for 5 in stores here, a buck from him.  Deals out there, just have to look, and probably use a little caution at times."
