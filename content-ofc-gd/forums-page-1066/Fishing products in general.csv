173937,forrest,2008-03-20 02:38:00,1032," I agree, I am not big on plastic, but I have had great success with them.  What makes the fish hold on?  Is it some kind of jaw specific neuro-toxin?  forrest"
173939,kickingfrog,2008-03-20 02:40:00,8333,"I remember the pocket fisherman. I wanted one sooo bad, I was probably 5 or so, now I know why my dad would just shake his head and say ""NO"". Dad's get smarter as you get older."
173964,muskymike,2008-03-20 03:01:00,772,"I think there is a new Pocket Fisherman. I saw a commercial for some telescoping pen and reel. I laughed so hard, the infomercial showed them catchin 5lb+ on this thing. it was so amusing. If i am ever in the states and see one I will pick it up and see who wants it on here hahaah"
173969,Radnine,2008-03-20 03:15:00,1538,"The fact that you can still buy a Rapala minnow, or a red and white Jitterbug is proof that the fishing industry isn’t as bad off as some (as far as gimmicks go). Think about golf for instance that reinvents itself every year, or how if you find a razor blade you like you had better buy a hundred of them as they won’t be available in a year. I think what keeps marketing from completely taking over fishing is the fact that you could still catch a fish with a line and a worm. Like Lundguy’s boat post earlier, boats from all ranges of the size, shape, and cost spectrum, with one thing in common; they get you out on the water to fish. You gotta love that."
173973,DanTheMan,2008-03-20 03:25:00,257,"  LOL, Same here"
173979,GBW,2008-03-20 03:48:00,8460,"HAHAHA, my grandfather had a Pocket Fisherman, if I can find that old junk some time this year I'll use it!  Then I'll toss it in the trash after 2 tries like I wanted to do about 20 years ago..."
173981,Guest lundboy,2008-03-20 04:04:00,0, Your guys that still want one... here it is it's still available and in production brand new:  http://www.popeilfamilystore.com/ppf.html
173987,maybe,2008-03-20 05:15:00,307, The Coleman Fishpen.  Can anybody look at this thing with a straight face?
174086,Zubris21,2008-03-20 13:44:00,563,  Nope not me!
174191,muskymike,2008-03-20 17:46:00,772,"Yes, Thats it. Someone needs to try one of these out in a Tournament"
174233,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-20 19:24:00,4399," I remember those well I took my youngest brother out fishing one time and he pulled that thing out put on a red and white and about 3 casts later he was into a 45"" Musky after about 20 seconds all he had left was the handle it was a price less moment to see the look on his face."
173580,kickingfrog,2008-03-19 15:23:00,8333,"My fishing line post got me thinking about fishing products in general.  The tackle company's have ""us"" down. They know we're on the look-out for something better to out-fish our buddies, or the guy next to us on the river.  What have you seen in the last couple of years that you thought was hit or miss?"
173582,Gerritt,2008-03-19 15:29:00,6129,"Those over sized rapala lures.. I find I cannot get them to run true, and tuning them is a pain.  G"

173601,setomonkey,2008-03-19 16:04:00,872,"I'm kind of old school when it comes to lures, there are always new ideas coming out but I like using the tried-and-true like Rapalas, red & white spoons, white spinnerbaits, jigs & twister tails, etc. These lures have proven themselves over the years and I trust them.  Mike"
173684,Ramble,2008-03-19 18:27:00,713,"Hmmmm good question. most of the lures i buy are versions of old stand-bys that already work well. One of the biggest improvements ive seen in the last few years is in the buzz bait dept. Some of them have a piece of wire from the hook to the weighted body.....i have fewer fish throw these the ther regular ones. Twin prop baits have been a around the block, but they still run straighter then the new single props.  That's the 1st one that comes to mind. If any of you work for a lure company TELL them to market more buzz baits with flexable hooks....i have a hell of a time finding them.  -R-"
173689,eye-tracker,2008-03-19 18:42:00,89,The simple but effective Mustad Slow Death hook for walleye fishing is going to be huge in 2008. It has been kept quiet for years and now with a hook on the market many anglers will see how a bent hook can take walleye with a simple chunk of crawler pulled behind a bouncer.  -s

173726,muskymike,2008-03-19 19:49:00,772,"The Banjo Minnow.  It actually did work if used properly. Something about the soft plastic. I remember the first time I used it, I figured, wow what a waste of money. 2nd cast I had a bucket. We caught about 15 fish the first night using those things. The downside to them, they pulled off the screw too easy and didnt last long."
173758,Sandbag,2008-03-19 21:07:00,533,"MuskyMike beat me to it.  Man if those commercials didn't have you running to the phone, I don't know what would LOL  Cheers  Craig"
173813,douG,2008-03-19 22:38:00,2693,I think the banjo minnow was the original dropshot rig.  No?
173835,DANIMAL,2008-03-19 23:06:00,215,"A lot of the new ""ultra realistic"" lures that just look like a hokey cartoon version of the real thing. They catch more fisherman than fish."
173842,Greencoachdog,2008-03-19 23:16:00,8163," You too eh?... if ya thought that one was bad you shoulda tried Roland Martins ""Helicopter"" lure, talk aboot a line twister!"

173852,Muskieman,2008-03-19 23:38:00,2472,"Do you guys Remember "" THE LURE"" ?  looked like a curled up plastic rapala..that had spent a few hours in the oven.  The Mepps Double Cross with adjustable blade pitch?  How  'boot Bill Norman Rainbow divers... with hologram sides that wouldn't run straight.?  The Flying Lure.... Helicopter Lure.... Banjo minnow[ kinda worked ] for me I loved watching the pike take off with my minnow..or uh   my $$$.  Money down the drain..... I should've  taken 'em  right from the box and thrown them in the lake.  Like a previous post stated "" fishing lures are made to attract fisherman not fish"".  I stick with old faithfuls and still do pretty good.  Randy.  "

I use gulp and power baits, as well as a half dozen other scented baits and I'm curious about the new Alive products. I'm not about to taste the various bait brands so the scent differences are moot, I get what size, shape and colour I like or what suits the application."

Even though I've had a lot of success with these I think I might move more towards the Gulp and other biodegradable soft plastics out there.  I figure, might as well leave the lakes as pristine as possible.  I also just picked up some slug-go soft plastics at BPS.  Supposed to be the first soft plastic that you can work like a hardbody bait.  Has anyone tried these at all?"

I was only 9 or so but knew about fishing.  I said ""how come you have that and not a fishing rod?"" I think I unintentionally insulted him lol.  He told me that a back up was too bulky!   What happened to those lures that exposed the hook on a spring mechanism after the fish hit.....I never thought it would work so hot.....anyone buy one of those?  forrest"
