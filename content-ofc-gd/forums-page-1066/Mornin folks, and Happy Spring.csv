174003,DT10Sam,2008-03-20 09:21:00,480,"Morning Lew and yes it hardly feels like spring yet, I'm sure there are many just waiting to put their boats in the water, it won't be long now. Everyone have a great day.  Regards, Sam"

174032,Deano,2008-03-20 11:47:00,767,"Ice fishing doesn't close here till the end of March and then it's wait till 3rd sat in May before season re-opens, so it's still 2+ months away. But should be all downhill after we lose these cold days first."
174041,Roy,2008-03-20 12:10:00,13728,We still have 10+ feet of 'Spring' all around the house.
174043,OhioFisherman,2008-03-20 12:24:00,6623,"LOL birds are still here, an early flight? Stupid birds, call ahead! We got 1 1/2 -2 inches of snow yesterday evening. Just hope the high waters doesn`t hurt the walleye spawn in the Erie tribs.  Way to early to get too excited here, we have had some pretty good snow falls even going into early April."
174046,Big Cliff,2008-03-20 12:35:00,6899,"We usually have ice out here by April 15 but I think it might be a bit later this year as temps have remained well below normal for the last few weeks. There is a lot of open water at any if the places that feed into the lake, Fenelon Falls and the Scugog River but out in front of my place there is still at least 18"" of solid ice.  Anyway Happy Spring everyone!"
174049,Jeff R,2008-03-20 12:47:00,94,"Same to you lew...unfortunately, just heard Environment Canada say to plan for 6 more weeks of winter.  Wonder if the new DST's messed up those groundhogs..."
