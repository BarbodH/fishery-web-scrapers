174061,foggy,2008-03-20 13:12:00,38,I'm reading that the Nanticoke coal plant may convert to a nuclear plant.  Does anyone here fish around any nuclear plants? Do they allow you anywhere near it for security reasons? thanks

You can not get too close anymore, Years ago you could go right up too the discharge.  With increased security you can only get so close but still with-in the prime fishing spots"
