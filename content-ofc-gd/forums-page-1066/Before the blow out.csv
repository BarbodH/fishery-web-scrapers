174065,silverstreak,2008-03-20 13:17:00,146,The water had just primed then the rain came. Was great up to that point. Cooler temps and wind should help clear things up for the weekend - at least I hope so. 
174067,mikebuns,2008-03-20 13:24:00,12,i was thinkin about headin out  this weekend in search of some chrome  nice fish
174068,mikebuns,2008-03-20 13:24:00,12,it should be some good fishin after that rain yeasterday
174082,Stoty,2008-03-20 13:40:00,2910,"Ya, me too. Just picked up some roe, and those little pink worms! Might try in the morning (Friday), then again on Sunday.  Anyone in the Pickering area want to get together and try?"
174102,ccmtcanada,2008-03-20 14:05:00,7971,Great stuff!  They are calling for a wetter and cooler spring than normal....sounds like prime steelhead weather if you ask me!!!
174169,jdmls,2008-03-20 16:47:00,575,
174176,Stoty,2008-03-20 17:05:00,2910,"Ya, thats true. I just hope that the water clears up enough today/overnight, that it will be decent in the morning."
174177,ccmtcanada,2008-03-20 17:06:00,7971,Yep..lots of pressure...change up presentation...that could be key on a weekend like this!
174180,FishFinder,2008-03-20 17:12:00,481,Those Ravenâ„¢ steelhead jigs sure do work great on pressured steelhead
174207,Paulus,2008-03-20 18:28:00,522," Think again! I've seen no more crowded day than Easter. I tried it a couple of years ago, and there were so many people out that I swore I wouldn't to it again    It can be almost as bad as the opener!"
174212,silverstreak,2008-03-20 18:37:00,146,"Skelzwoods I like the Riverwood jig over the ravens...... they have Better, stronger Daiichi Hooks. "
174252,FishFinder,2008-03-20 20:26:00,481," I used to only use Riverwood jigs as well, made by Jim Butler I believe. But at a fraction of the cost and larger variety of colours Raven is now my go to choice. As well I had alot of the riverwoods bend at the shank of the hook while fighting a fish, resulting in the loss of some nice fish and a useless jig. I have yet to have this happen with a raven.  Dont even get me started about that sticky sharp finish that bends after one drift on any real rock bottomed river.  Ofcourse you could always make your own at an even lower price than the ravens"
174283,buckster,2008-03-20 22:32:00,530,how do y'all rig them............ how close would your last split shot be to the jig?
174288,silverstreak,2008-03-20 22:46:00,146,To each his own SW. Riverwoods are made right here in Canada and were the first to introduce the steelhead jig in this region. The Daiichi hooks they are tied on have never opened up or became dull in all the yrs I have been using them. Me thinks you have an alterior motive. No problem.....more for me.
174289,silverstreak,2008-03-20 22:49:00,146,Buckster Fish jigs same as roe. Personally I like to leave about 8  inches between my jig and last split shot. Peace
174290,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-20 22:53:00,278,"Been making my own for about 15 years now. Work great!!  Dont be afraid to experiment. If its ugly, they'll probably eat it."
