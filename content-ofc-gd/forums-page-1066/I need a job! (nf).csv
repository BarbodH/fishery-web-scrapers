173712,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-19 19:34:00,1351,"Hey there guys,  Well I'm unemployed at the moment and with only 1 year left, I really need to start looking for some experience that is related to my field of study (Environmental Science - Biology stream). If you know of a company in my field is hiring, please let me know! I have a car, so transportation is not much of an issue. Preferably within 30 min drive of GTA. Full time or part time. Please PM me!   Thanks for any help, Kevin"
173809,fishing n autograph,2008-03-19 22:35:00,2540,how bout policing? I went to the police college with 2 guys who were in the same position you are and joined OPP and York....not a bad option
173817,holdfast,2008-03-19 22:42:00,1813,"Or the Military.  You can always move.  Mayor of Oshawa told the Priemier of Sask that he would like his unemployed people work here for a week then go home on weekends.  We like the Idea here because we need the workers, but I dont think its practical.  Its not Fort McMurray yet"

173898,boatman,2008-03-20 01:38:00,350,"I don't know your particular background or schooling, but as an environmental professional I suggest you canvas local engineering firms. They are always hiring students and new grads. The bigger the company the more likely they will need entry level staff. Many professionals start in consulting and move on to other positions later. Environmental jobs don't commonly pay well at the entry level, but the money increases quickly after a few years. This is the time of year that  employers start looking for new hires. You should expect to see lots of job postings in the next two months for entry level positions."
173902,irishfield,2008-03-20 01:48:00,26272,Maybe someone's doing a new study on the Grand River that you can help with Kevin...  Good luck in your hunt for employement!
173921,boatman,2008-03-20 02:21:00,350," That would be the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA). Actually, most conservation aurthorities (CA's) will be hiring summer students, but those jobs usually start in May or June. You can also try volunteering with your local CA, which is probably Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) to get your foot in the door. TRCA used to pay volunteers $10 a day."
173928,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-20 02:30:00,1351,"I've looked into TRCA already, looks like a good first step. Aswell the consulting job does pay well after some years of experience! I'll keep looking.. and keep 'em coming!   Thanks guys  Kevin"
173929,Gerritt,2008-03-20 02:31:00,6129,   Yeah but then they will be called naysayers and crack smokers that can read..... we would not want that would we?  G

174028,Big Cliff,2008-03-20 11:41:00,6899,"You might try checking with the O.F.A.H., I know it is a little more than 30 minutes from the GTA but the experience would be worth it."
