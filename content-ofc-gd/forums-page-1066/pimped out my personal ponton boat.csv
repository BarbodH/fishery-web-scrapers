173998,SlowPoke,2008-03-20 08:26:00,2984," Well duhhhh.... downriggers of course! Nice job UF, I'll be looking for you in the bay... channel 68 on the VHF We'll have to hook-up this year. -Brian"
174004,Tinman,2008-03-20 09:21:00,376,"i think it needs those neon lights on the bottom, plus a tv stand and a brakcet to hold on a dish"
174022,b2kptbo,2008-03-20 11:21:00,1505,"Pretty slick, WTG..."
174133,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-20 15:29:00,835,"You have raised the center of gravity a long ways from the original design and might notice a change in stability, hopefully before its too late but probably better than standing on it. I take it the seat goes back to its original position for the 6' waves.  I bet thats a whole lot of fun, I want one."
174136,Stoty,2008-03-20 15:37:00,2910,"Ya man, thats pretty sweet for sure!  I saw the epoisode of ""Bass Techs"" that they did that to a pontoon boat like that. They cut a hole in the deck, added netting underneath for a livewell, and put a hinged cover over the hole for easy access to drop the fish you want to keep.  It turned out to be awesome!!  Other than the FishFinder(GPS) unit, and livewell, you have done very nice work! Good job!  *Stoty"
174138,Headhunter,2008-03-20 15:40:00,5703,"Satellite Radio! Wow, good job! A little more chrome and your good to pop it onto the back of a truck and cruise Yonge Street! HH"
174143,Hookset,2008-03-20 15:46:00,367,"Drift sock (small one) - I use one on my back lakes ""tupperwear boat"".  Stops you from spinning down the shoreline like a fart in the wind. And controls your drift nicely too.   Hookset."
174154,kennyman,2008-03-20 16:08:00,737,"We just need to get you a chain steering wheel, latino accent and some dingle balls and you'd really be cool. Nice job. I bet it'd be exciting on some fast water!"
174188,walleyejigger,2008-03-20 17:28:00,876,"that's some awesome pimpin', great job"
174206,snag,2008-03-20 18:23:00,1932,We have to hook-up!  That looks awesome!  and there I thought you sold it????  I can think of some areas where that would be the best unit to have.  Please post as many progress reports as possible.
174216,TJQ,2008-03-20 18:43:00,7806,Ya we need to get you a pimp hat... lol
174286,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-20 22:45:00,2050," Yeah good call hookset - last season when I was fishing twitch baits I'd end up going in circles from the pull! haha    Hey Snag - I had it up for sale for a while, and had a small boat lined up (all before the house came along) but the small boat deal fell through, the tuner didn't sell right away because it dropped in price from when I bought it...yadda yadda the rest is history.....  Got some PM's about the original boat - I paid close to $500.00 for it just over a year ago, and saw it on sale at BPS last week for around $250.00.  It's a solid little boat - and considering it's big brother is $800.00 you can't go wrong..  Cheers guys, UF"
174287,ravinerat,2008-03-20 22:45:00,64,It sure looks pretty sweet. I wondered about the triangle of stability being so high now too. I'm sure you'll enjoy the pontoon boat.  My buddy bought one for the back lakes we hit. I'm going to one because of getting too wet in the float tube. I'll have to show my buddy yours.  RR
174423,mikethespike,2008-03-21 05:32:00,51,"agree with the stability observation,  also looks like weight is concentrated to the rear,  not familiar with the motor's hp but you might consider putting the motor right @ the front to prevent backflip.  i would also suggest some kind of quick-realease clips or floating line for the rods, nets, etc.  they do look expensive and you wouldnt want to loose them in the event of a flip.  just my 2 cents..."
174453,musky66,2008-03-21 11:38:00,273,A Beagle seat! My beagle loves fishing in my boat with me- but it's got a bit more room than yours!
174457,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-21 11:52:00,2050," Yeah I was thinking of setting up some sort of clips for the rods, last year I used to just strap them down to the frame with travel straps.  As for flipping backwards, not a problem,I did many balancing tests prior to doing the mods. Even with the additions, the boat is only about 70 lbs, so the motor mount at the back does make it lean back a little in the photo but once you add my weight which is situated closer to the front of the boat it'll even out fine.  The seat also has the option to slide forward and backwards on rails which will allow for more balancing adjustments. Once I get it on the water I'm going to move around the battery until I get the balance PERFECT, than bolt the bracket down into place and I'm good to go!  I won't be using it in rapids of any sort, mostly resevoirs, shalow water back bays and slow streams/rivers.  I stood up on it all year last season without any balance issues also, so now I'll just be fishing with a little more comfort.  Any ideas for making rod clips?  The chances of the boat going down are slim to none but possible as anything in life!  Cheers, UF"

173794,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-19 22:15:00,2050,"Well I had high hopes that 2008 was going to be the year that I buy myself a new boat, but....  1 Wedding + 1 new to us house = No new boat!  We're buying this house off of my in-laws, the deal closes in a few weeks!  We're pretty stolked as it's our first house...    We put a pond in last fall to add a little scenery to our backyard wedding this summer. Still have to finish it off.   Anyways, down to the real project..... I decided as a consolation to not buying a boat this season I was going to make some additions to my personal pontoon.  This is the boat PRE-MODIFICATIONS   In short here's the mods....  - Front to back platform - room to stand at the front (made from plywood I had at the house) - New Seat & Adjustable Pedestal - 3 rear rod holders made from leftover ABS pipe I had at the house - 1 Net holder at the back made from ABS - 1 Front Rod Holder - 1 cup holder made from 3"" ABS, cut to be just the right size for a large double double... - Made a motor mount on the back by soldering 1"" copper pipe onto the existing steel frame, and bolting a piece of plywood to it.  Don't mind the basement - it's a work in progress...        What's left?  - Minn Kota Electric motor - Battery & bracket to hold it in place - Inexpensive graph  Does anybody else have any suggestions?  Cheers, UF"
173796,JEREMY,2008-03-19 22:19:00,300,All you need now is a pink pimp hat like Pete Maina.
173797,forrest,2008-03-19 22:22:00,1032,"That setup looks awesome!  How do you row with the seat so high, does it adjust all the way down?  Other ideas: lights? camera stand for self portraits? live well under the platform?  (I think that is the coolest of the 3)  forrest"
173798,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-19 22:22:00,1351,"Hey UF, pretty neat mods but i'd be a tad worried on the normal plywood you used? should've opted for some marine plywood, especially since i assume it will be soaked quite often..  kevin"
173799,Bernie,2008-03-19 22:23:00,3190,I love to see innovation UF.  Well done. The backyard is looking good too.
173803,Greencoachdog,2008-03-19 22:29:00,8163,That is a sweet setup you got there!!!  I think one of those floating wire mesh fish baskets would make an inexspensive livewell!
173804,bigreddog,2008-03-19 22:30:00,84,Beer fridge?
173810,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-19 22:35:00,1351,"oh, and if you're sticking a motor on it, don't forget all the other things you gotta bring along.. pea-less wistle, life jacket, bailing device, 50ft bouyant heaving line, paddles(i see you have them anyways), flashlight and pleasure craft operator card!"
173812,forrest,2008-03-19 22:37:00,1032," Yes, leaning back on that chair only to have the base rip out of the wood would suck (happened to me). Would it be hard to seal the piece of plywood?  That Marine plywood isn't cheap!  forrest"
173815,pidge,2008-03-19 22:41:00,438,"love it, good stuff. Whatd kind of motor you puttin on it?"
173820,irishfield,2008-03-19 22:46:00,26272," Motor or not... he probably needs all that stuff (less the operator card) just like a canoe or paddle boat. Paddle boat don't need the flashlight if you wear your life jacket.. figure that one out!  Great stuff there UF.. the boat.. the yard/house and the understanding of what comes first in life...Family !  PS... maybe that Mercer guy has a boat somewhere, for the bigger water, that he can lend ya!"
173823,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-19 22:47:00,2050," Thanks for the worries guys!  I went without marine grade plywood as I already had 3/4"" plywood at the house which I had used last year for the rear platform and it worked out great!  I also doused it in tremclad rust paint which helps keep the water out.  As for the seat ripping out, it ain't going anywhere as the bolts go through the plywood and into the pre-existing steel runners that are welted to the steel frame...  And yepp, you need your pleasure craft operator card with this boat, and that black pouch on the right pontoon holds all the necessary gear!  LIVEWELL:  I wanted one, but I rarely keep any fish except for panfish so I might just bring a small cooler along if I plan to keep any.  Lights - great idea, I'm hoping to add some as soon as they fit in my budget!  Camera Stand - I'm thinking of adding something to my net holder!  Thanks for the ideas and all guys!  Muchly Appreciated! Keep 'em comin'  Cheers, UF"
173824,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-19 22:49:00,2050, Just getting a 30lb thrust Minn Kota endura - had one for my inflatable boat back in highschool and was pleased with it.  Mostly getting it because it's dirt cheap and i'm on a budget! haha  cheers
173828,Puckhead,2008-03-19 22:54:00,377,Nice job!  That looks fantastic
173836,ccmtcanada,2008-03-19 23:07:00,7971,Very cool UF!!!  Looks like you'll be fishing in a little more comfort this year....with some nice little extras!
173844,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-19 23:21:00,1183,Where's the wife going to sit?  I think you have done an awesome job...no need to get a boat for many years to come.  haha  Congrats on the new home...and upcoming wedding....love the pond.
173856,highdrifter,2008-03-19 23:42:00,2534,That's just awesome!  All you need is an electric motor and you're set!!
173861,fishindevil,2008-03-20 00:10:00,6254,"Great fishing pontoon boat man !!!!   looks great,thats some great ideas you had there,how about a portable graph?? !!!!!that would be the icing on the cake for sure,so then you could be on all those lakes & rivers and know the depth,the weed beds as well as structure,then you would have it all....good work & job well done !!!!"
173863,setomonkey,2008-03-20 00:12:00,872,"Sweet ride, you have done a great job of customizing your pontoon boat!  Mike"
173868,Crazyhook,2008-03-20 00:27:00,1154,Fuzzy Dice and a barb wire license plate holder?
173910,splashhopper,2008-03-20 02:05:00,2931,not sure if this was mentioned yet...  Attach a fish finder / GPS unit ?  A cradle holder for the baby? lol
173968,kickingfrog,2008-03-20 03:09:00,8333,"Nice work, I never would have thought of all that. Have you tested it out in the pond yet? Maybe there is a new carer in store for you, or at least a tv show. ;-)  Soooo... What's in the pond???"
173970,Sinker,2008-03-20 03:18:00,8692,You ever fish Harcourt park? You look familiar.....as well as the boat. Pretty slick rig fer sure!  Sinker
173977,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-20 03:39:00,2050," The baby's already16 months old, walking and talking so no crib needed there! we did it all backwards...baby then house, then marriage! lol    I'd love to test it out in the pond but it's still frozen over - cept for the small hole I keep in it to add oxygen for the bluegills...   nope, can't say I've fished Harcourt Park...don't even know where that is!  I mostly fished a small conservation area near my place last summer, but I'm going to venture out into long point bay this season.... port rowan is just down the road...  A couple people mentioned graph's....  I'd rather not get a portable as they're a little more pricey than the non-portables, and besides i'm going to have the 12v battery already for the electric motor.  The only reason I MIGHT get a portable is so I can use it on the ice in the winter....still trying to figure that one out!  thanks again all!"
173984,discophish,2008-03-20 04:30:00,392,"A helmet, adrenaline, and some heavy white water to get that awesome boat surfing down some rapids!   I love it!  Great job on everything and a fine idea.  Congrats to all your accomplishments.  You should give 'er a name and stamp the pontoon!"
