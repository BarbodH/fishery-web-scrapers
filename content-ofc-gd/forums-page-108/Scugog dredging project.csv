988487,msp,2016-12-12 20:51:00,1336,"Sounds good to me. I think that Scugog needs all the help it can get. The creation of wetlands to filter storm water before it enters the lake can only be a good thing. Although a very small project ( footprint wise ), every bit will help. Im sure Ducks Unlimited will be all over it."
988552,OhioFisherman,2016-12-13 17:37:00,6623,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Scugog  Not a very deep lake for up north? Some dredging may help?
988565,quickme,2016-12-13 20:09:00,261,for the area that they are going to Dredge I think its a excellent idea.  that section of the lake is very shallow and during the summer months its just a pile of sloppy algae.   Deepening certain parts of the lake would be great and hopefully lessen the lake of some of the choking algae during June-July.
988570,jimmer,2016-12-13 20:53:00,2730,It's good for the people that will use that area.
