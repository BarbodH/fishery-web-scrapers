I've had previous repairs at this store and have nothing but great service.  I go in, tell the girl what happened and also that the frames are peeling a bit.  I sat down for about 30 seconds then she reappears with a brand new set of glasses.  I ask how much and she says 'Nothing'.   I told her the last time I was in, it was about $80 for a new set of lenses (Installed).  She said that she was happy I was still a Maui Jim customer and there was going to be no charge today.  Walked out with a brand new pair of glasses, as happy as a pig in ****.     I've got no plans on ever buying another brand of sunglasses.    Can't beat customer service like this.    "

980673,TheTallPolak,2016-08-29 18:18:00,26,"I am also informed that Maui Jim have the best lenses! Before buying, you should look up your insurance policy, there is usually some coverage that can be written off! I know the Maui Jims arent cheap!"

980682,woodenboater,2016-08-29 19:39:00,2277,"see, some companies 'get it'. it may cost them a few bucks here and there but I'm sure they will get that back in spades from the good word and will that will spread from such kind acts. can't buy pr like this.  btw, musky rod, uglystick or 3 weight fly rod"

988082,Headhunter,2016-12-07 19:59:00,5703,"Resurrecting this thread because I just had a similar experience. I busted the pair of Jim's I bought in the 90's a couple of years ago. Fast forward to last week and while picking up new reading glasses, I noticed that they carried Maui Jim's and told them of my busted glasses. They asked me to bring them in and see what they can do for me. $85 later, I have a brand new pair of Jims (they currently retail for over $300!). That's how customers should be treated. They could give lessons to a number of companies! HH"
988099,misfish,2016-12-07 21:25:00,29133,"Joe, do you have readers on yours? I love my pair. The readers make for easy tieing of the knots and so on. You dont even notice them from the outside. Great glasses."
988100,Headhunter,2016-12-07 21:28:00,5703,"No Brian, just the regular lenses. Back when I bought my original pair, I didn't need glasses! LOL Probably should have though.... HH"

988141,kenzy31,2016-12-08 12:42:00,261,"Great to hear Bill, I missed the first time around. I too recently had FANTASTIC service from Maui Jim. I bought a pair (non-script) from LensCrafters in July after having enough of the broken $15 jobs. Paid a good buck for the most comfortable pair of glasses I've ever owned and had been taking good care of them. Somehow got a pit mark on the right lens so I stopped into the store for advice. They sent them out for me to the Mississauga office an in 3 days got a call saying they don't cover impact damage, but would do a onetime replacement FREE OF CHARGE! I was floored! Never expected that at all, and now I will never buy another!"
988144,BillM,2016-12-08 13:11:00,17367,"Glad to hear you guys are getting the level of service I got.  Not surprised though!  Great company, great product.  I'll never buy another brand of glasses."
