987640,misfish,2016-12-01 22:59:00,29133,Yup. Maybe power down my pc too?
987641,J-M,2016-12-01 23:01:00,65,Not sure if the program has reset on you? I assume you were running some type of skin/build before which had a pre-loaded set of addons?  You may have to re-download your build. I use Ares Wizard to download a build. This link will help you set it up. Or it may be best to take the box back to to the seller and they might be able to reload it for you but it can be done yourself below......  https://seo-michael.co.uk/tutorial-how-to-install-ares-wizard-kodi/
987644,misfish,2016-12-01 23:10:00,29133,"I assume you were running some type of skin/build before which had a pre-loaded set of addons?   Yes, we had it pre loaded."
