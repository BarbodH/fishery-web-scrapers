987027,grimsbylander,2016-11-22 15:19:00,3016,No fish is safe from the Bunk... well done AGAIN!

987045,Moosebunk,2016-11-22 18:51:00,3970,"Bunk catches everything that swims, gonna read that one for sure when I get a chance  No fish is safe from the Bunk... well done AGAIN!  I was a newbie to this, still am. And during the week everything from carrying bags, towing carts, fighting fish, taking pictures, baiting, rigging, casting, driving, etc., was all teamwork.  I'd doubt any one single angler could safely land the 250+ pound bull sharks on their own, (especially in bigger surf) so it was good we had extra able bodies to help in every CPR way. The smaller sharks though, could see me wanting to return to cast topwaters for them and tarpon. They could be more manageable. Reeling in that bull from beginning to end was a single tug-of-war that was great fight, but not something that needs repeating anytime soon. It was actually a challenging trip in many different ways"

987059,RangerGuy,2016-11-22 21:25:00,564,Holy man! You must be retired HAHAHA!  Nice report dude!
987098,Moosebunk,2016-11-23 13:19:00,3970,"Holy man! You must be retired HAHAHA!  Nice report dude!  Work contracts. It's like being retired.    All work when I work, lots of play when I don't.    All that may change for the worse in the New Year though...  Must be a wild and fun fight,Thanks for the report !!!!,maybe one day here  The few I fought were, in different ways too.  The big bull was exhausting, like a big sturgeon but bigger and faster initially.  Only a marlin and friend's yellowfin has shown more power.  "" I rather despise looking at my aging, hairy, fattening self in the mirror ""   Ha. great line Bunk ! wicked report as usual   It's not always true.  Thanks for checking this one out gang.  Only a couple more to catch up on to end the 2016 then it'll be a long haul to the next.  During the down time over the winter, rewriting/editing some old reports to throw up on the site I may post a few here for any interested."

987737,misfish,2016-12-03 00:17:00,29133,"Cant say shark is on the top of my list, but Tarpon, oh ya. The number one at the top. I dought though it will ever happen. Those are some insane attacks on the pack of mullet.  Enjoyed the read Drew."
987773,limeyangler,2016-12-03 18:29:00,5204,"Awesome as usual Drew, i'm gonna try for some sharks at the end of January, gonna night fish this year in Antigua."
987811,Moosebunk,2016-12-04 14:19:00,3970,"Cant say shark is on the top of my list, but Tarpon, oh ya. The number one at the top. I dought though it will ever happen. Those are some insane attacks on the pack of mullet.  Enjoyed the read Drew.  They weren't at the top here either. Didn't figure on ever fishing them actually. Glad to have done so. With you on this Brian, tarpon are at the top, atlantics and roosters. Can see tarpon coming next. Hook up to landing them ratio is about 1 in 8to10.  Salt water kings!  Awesome as usual Drew, i'm gonna try for some sharks at the end of January, gonna night fish this year in Antigua.  Thanks Simon. Can't help with Antigua but if it's fishing like what was done in Florida I can maybe give a few general ideas that might help.  Good luck there."

987873,BillM,2016-12-05 17:41:00,17367,"Right on Bunk!  One of my fav things to do is shore fish in Florida, never know what you're going to tie into!"
