987395,NAW,2016-11-28 18:00:00,4022,I assume they are a 6 bolt pattern?  What are the specs?  I know a few tire guys that have lots of rims kicking around.  There's a slight chance they might have something kicking around.

Learn what's on your different vehicles and forget about the rest. I've been in the trade 30 plus years and I still don't know even half of the differences between rims/wheels.  Dan."
987537,CRUD150,2016-11-30 21:11:00,87,"Count me in for 30 as well. Customer brought in some steel Toyota wheels to mount on his brand new $80000.00 Suburban. I told him they will not fit because the bolt pattern is different on the wheels. He asked if we could change the bolt pattern on the truck to fit the wheels....  Reminding myself that there is no such thing as a stupid question, I was able to sell him some alloy wheels.  I become acquainted with a lot of KIJi buyers that have purchased misrepresented wheel/tire deals. There is not a lot of recourse, buyer beware."

They take in many write off of late model vehicles.  But for 88 bucks I would be pointing myself towards London asap. I paid more than that for the Altima wheels a few winters back and I was happy to.  Sorry but I never buy anything off websites unless I can see them in person."
