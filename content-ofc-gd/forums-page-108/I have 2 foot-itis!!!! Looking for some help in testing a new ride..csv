985663,RangerGuy,2016-11-10 16:47:00,564,"If anybody runs either of the boats listed below and wouldn't mind if I tagged along for a day or few hours. I would really appreciate it!  I'll cover food ,coffee and pitch for gas FOR SURE!.  Skeeter: WX2060, MX2040 Ranger: 621FS ,620FS Warrior: V203 DC or V21-21 DC Triton: 216 or 206 Fishhunter  These rigs are seriously expensive and we want to make sure the right one!  We spent a day in the Skeeter WX2190 and it was awesome!      "
985669,fishindevil,2016-11-10 18:39:00,6254,that's a very tough choice for sure.....some serious boats there...I have been in 2 of those and what you have to decide is whats best for you and what you want
985673,lew,2016-11-10 18:54:00,12766,"You probably remember my boat Greg, a Skeeter WX1880  It was a bit smaller than that WX2060 your looking at but it was a fantastic boat that handled big water with no problems and with a Yammie 150 it would run just over 50 MPH.  Can't comment on any of the others but I can guarantee you'd be happy with a Skeeter."
985703,grimsbylander,2016-11-10 23:14:00,3016,"Get the Ranger so you don't have to change your username! LOL  I'm a Ranger guy so I know which way I'd go. If I had the money, I'd be looking at the Z522D as well."
985704,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-10 23:28:00,10439,This is what you want right here!!!  http://www.hydrasports.com/5300-suenos.aspx  
985705,RangerGuy,2016-11-10 23:43:00,564,"Yup tough decision for sure and can't believe I'm making this choice again. I agonized for a year before we got our Alaskan, its a great boat. Perfect for the guy/gal that hunts & fishes.  This was me until this year, I've lost the urge to get up @ 2 or 3 am every weekend to hunt by myself every weekend. My dog and I are still gonna hunt but not nearly as hard.  Lew, I'm partial to the wx2190 but I think the wx2060 will be a better fit for us. Will u come out for a day when we get her?  Anyways, hoping somebody will help out with the test days. I really need to make an educated choice for a machine at this level."

Can't comment on any of the others but I can guarantee you'd be happy with a Skeeter.   I was really impressed with the ride on Lews Skeeter. It was a smooth comfortable ride. When I was an AM and a scrutineer, I got to be on many different boats. Sure each driver drives thier own way, but I was uncomfortable on some. One that comes to mind, was the Ranger walleye boat. My back was so sore after our day out.  I was also out on a champion. That thing was a rocket and never once did I feel uncomfortable. Then there was the legend bass boat. OMG.  IMO, the caddilac of them all. Just my thoughts, and I wish I was in your boat, sorta speak Ranger.  Good luck on your choice. Im sure it wont be easy."
985708,RangerGuy,2016-11-11 00:06:00,564,"Brian, I have read that about the Ranger Fisherman, also I've read alot about them spearing waves. Can be very driver centric though!  I loved my 680T, just a bit small when the waves kicked up."
985735,porkpie,2016-11-11 04:24:00,2521,Selling Alaskan?
985749,Garnet,2016-11-11 13:49:00,2056,Getting a great dealer would be huge for me.  That takes out Skeeter Canada but not Clayton NY.  Ranger also has bad dealers.  Triton has Hunters Bay in Calander and great dealer.
985763,Sinker,2016-11-11 15:00:00,8692,Ha...beat me to it! Love that boat!!  S.
985799,RangerGuy,2016-11-11 17:50:00,564,Thanks guys! I'll check those dealers out.. I will be selling the alaskan..can't keep 2 boats LOL!
985900,fishdawg,2016-11-12 13:17:00,912,Ive been in a few Ranger 621s... Would likely be my 1st choice  Good luck!
985902,grimsbylander,2016-11-12 13:46:00,3016,"BTW, I have two footitis as well. I started looking around for a mid 2000's 520 or 521 last month. Tough to find one with the options I'm looking for...lots of single console boats out there but this time I'm going dual. I've also been glancing at walleye boats like you. I fished a tournament on Erie 3 weeks ago and it was a killer. There's that other site that has a really good classified section for multi-species boats to check out. Don't know if I can post it here...shhhhh here's a clue...starts with Walleye....ends in Central.  Good luck! This is a good time of year to find a used boat stateside and drag it home."
985945,RangerGuy,2016-11-12 22:37:00,564,"Yup been to that address ;-) I'm also decide used vs new, 1-2 year old at this level are still super Expensive. I'm kind feeling if I'm gonna down that much might as well go new.    "
985953,OhioFisherman,2016-11-12 23:56:00,6623,  A couple of years old but a pretty smooth dry ride?
985954,RangerGuy,2016-11-13 00:07:00,564,Gonna have to try for a ride in one of these as well thnx! :-)
985955,dave524,2016-11-13 00:08:00,4508,  A couple of years old but a pretty smooth dry ride?  That's not even a decent walleye chop on Erie   let's see it in 3 footers
985966,OhioFisherman,2016-11-13 01:49:00,6623,"LOL Dave, I lived 1/4 of a mile from Lake Erie for a time, it was nice, I could drive up to the end of the street and decide if it worth going out.  South winds here were usually a lock, I didn't have to go far out to catch smallies or walleye."
986508,Sinker,2016-11-17 20:41:00,8692,Post that Alaskan up here when your ready. Is it a tiller?? I may be interested.  S.
986518,RJackson,2016-11-18 00:47:00,113,Another one to consider in this class of rides is the GL Lunds.  I've ran them for 3 years and they are quite the ride.  RJ
986550,porkpie,2016-11-18 14:22:00,2521,"He is, it's a good deal and a tiller.  I'm just not looking for a tiller anymore.  Check your pm, I'll forward what he sent me!"
986553,Garnet,2016-11-18 14:53:00,2056,I seen a Triton 215 on BFB 2007.
988283,Gerry,2016-12-10 11:54:00,257,"As you see in my profile pic, I have the Ranger 620 DVS. I've owned it for approx. 7 years and it's been very good. All of the ones in your list would be good rigs IMO."
