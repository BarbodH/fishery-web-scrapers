As soon as I pulled out of laneway onto Lakeshore I was met by blowing snow and high winds. Erie Ave. was white out conditions. I pulled into the lot at 4:25. 2 school buses had pulled into the Home Hardware lot, smart.  On the way home at 6 it was dead calm, no wind and no snow flying and it was as if every snow machine in the county waiting for the last 2 winters for white stuff were flying along the roads and fields under the bright light of the full Moon. I had to smile thinking about all the snow guys on this site having fun if they were here.  2 week old snow tires on the Altima passed the test. I had the road to myself to try spinning out and braking. My wife said the only tracks on Lakeshore Rd when she pulled in at 12:30 were mine and a few snowmobiles. I could hear a few up to 1AM going down the laneway. Have fun guys."

The crud left by the plow was a chore and a half. Without my machine, I'd probably still be out there still working on my own. Mild out now but if you don't get after it, it'll be a solid block of ice once the sun goes down. Think we got more snow in the last 24 hours than we had all last Winter."

We had a lake effect storm last night coming off the lake from the south, and it was blowing snow from the north too. Tich asked me if I was going to call my snow guy, he charges 25 bucks to do the 4 car drive, blow a 50' path to the door, path to the side door and 50 feet to my shed. I did the math a few years ago and it is far more economical to pay him than to buy a new blower, fuel it and maintain it. These past 2 winters he didn't plow once. The 2 winters before that he was here a total of 10 times and it was 20 bucks then. So a total of $200.00 for the last 4 winters. Do the math, cheap and I don't have to leave the cottage. I pay more to spider spray every year, actually more than double what it costs to pay the guy. He has a mini tractor with a blower on it. It takes him maybe 15 minutes. I didn't call him because I knew it would all be gone today, and it is. I don't know what it is about town folk, Dad used to go out as soon as the flakes flew holding his shovel in the air. When there was enough to snow blow he was in his glory. I tell everyone good high Sorrels beat shovelling snow.  I was always doing favours for folks and they would ask me what kind of beer I drank. I didn't have the heart to tell them a case of beer lasts 3 months here, I might have 1 a week, maybe, more for folks popping in . I would rather have a small gift certificate from CTC or the like, where I can buy anything from a Rappala to gas. Just something to consider Cliff."
