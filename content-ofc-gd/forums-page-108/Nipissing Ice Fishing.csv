988468,jimmer,2016-12-12 17:56:00,2730,Does anyone know of an operator on Nipissing that fishes in shallow water to target perch and pike?
988475,Joeytier,2016-12-12 18:31:00,3990,"Sunset Cove offers day huts in the shallow flats on the east end of the lake, very productive for jumbos and even walleye early in the winter  But some of the absolute best perch fishing in the lake is in the 'deep' holes offshore.  The waltonian offers day huts in very productive perch fishing grounds."
988485,Sterling,2016-12-12 20:51:00,477,"Like Joey said, deep is where perch usually hang out. My shack is stationed in the eastern flats and we get maybe 20% perch, 70% walleye, rest is a mix of everything else including pike.  If someone can suggest a way to ""target perch"" in shallow water, I'd be all over that!"
988489,jimmer,2016-12-12 20:55:00,2730,I'm just trying to find a place where we can avoid hooking walleye in deeper water if we have to release them.
988494,Joeytier,2016-12-12 22:29:00,3990,"Rent a hotel right in North bay and you can fish from sunset point right up to the mouth of duchesnay creek along the 'perch flats'.  Run and gun till you find fish, 90% of the water is 16-17 ft or under.  Use the hut clusters as general starting points and you will do well."
