987706,LeXXington,2016-12-02 17:03:00,1928,Really Nice fish..  Congrats on your catch.
987712,aplumma,2016-12-02 19:06:00,6896,Nice catch of fish thanks for the report and picture and sorry for some of our C&R people are not thrilled with your report. I will ask people to please read reports in the spirit that they are written and reply accordingly. Winternet is coming lets keep it to a minimum.   Thanks  Art
987715,dave524,2016-12-02 19:43:00,4508," Used to keep a few when ice fishing too. It was fantastic...you'd never know you were eating pike if you'd only eaten pike caught in July/August.  As a teen in the 60's one of the first rituals of spring was going pike spearing, they tasted pretty good in March too."
987720,jimmer,2016-12-02 21:04:00,2730,I am a support of C&R but also a supporter of filling my belly YUMMY. Pike are the perfect fish for doing that and are prolific enough in those sizes.  We can be our own worst enemies sometimes. Those pet@ people must just love it when they see outdoorsmen arguing about harvested fish.
987721,Joeytier,2016-12-02 21:33:00,3990,"People like controversy  In my opinion, if you have to justify legally harvesting non-trophy fish (on a fishing forum no less) based on nothing more than a picture, then there's something wrong with this picture.  I'm just jealous that he has a freezer full of pike and I don't"

987764,huzzsaba,2016-12-03 16:06:00,884,Nice Catch ReelingMachine!  Still looking for my first one.  Would love to catch my limit someday of pike!  Thanks for sharing!
987767,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-03 16:32:00,8243,"OK another convoluted possession/limit question. If I catch a limit of fish, go to shore and eat 1 can I go back out and catch another to fill my possession limit? Even though I will keep some fish rarely do we limit out on Walleye here. Not needed really because 4 nice fish in a morning of trolling or drifting would be close to or over 40 pounds. 4 or 5 fish between 2 of us is plenty. I don't want to be on the water at Noon anyway, too hot and that's when the winds on Erie pick up most days. Fish Farmer and Wormdunker can have the entire lake to themselves when it's 30C and you are covered in Mayflies. Even when we get into a good school of Jumbo Perch I don't relish cleaning 200 Perch. We have a lady at the Marina that will clean them but 200 fish might cost well over $100.00 at 3 bucks a pound."
987772,manitoubass2,2016-12-03 17:02:00,11391,No you cannot eat one fish then replace it later.  Its daily limit. If you got your limit thats all you can keep. Ie you cant go drop em off at home and catch another limit later that day.  You can switch species however.  I started off keeping pike because my family is huge and obviously 4 walleye isnt gonna feed us. So Id keep 2 or so northerns to add to the amount.  But now I actually prefer the northern and c&r most walleyes. The wife and kids dont mind one bit either.
987774,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-03 18:48:00,8243,"Nothing wrong with eating Pike as many here agree. They are a solid fish. I make a tomato pasta sauce with pike and Brandy. Simple toasted garlic on EVO, in go the fillets and sear on each side, a splash of Brandy, some in the pan too, chopped plum tomatoes, not pureed, finish with Parm cheese, lots of it, fresh Basil and Parsley. Of course the Pike will break up, you want that. Pour on any pasta, more cheese and drizzle with EVO. Best with a tube pasta so all the goodies get in the pasta. A new fave of ours is Pennoni lishe (no lines), 1/2 way between Penne and Rigatoni.  M2B2 bring up the cooking thread so I don't hi jack anymore threads."
987838,reelingMachine,2016-12-04 19:39:00,29,Tried the same spot yesterday. Caught 1.  It might be the new moon and few warm days that turned them on the first time.

987661,grimsbylander,2016-12-02 02:09:00,3016,"Great work! My bet is the OP is already regretting the post. It's just so damn hypocritical to look at one photograph and pass judgement on keep vs release. A guy could fish the whole summer while applying C & R and keep a limit of fish out the colder fall water just to get flack from the ""elitists"" on OFC. Unless someone is breaking a limit or possession law, please mind your own business. If the MNR wanted help, they'd ask.  Quick, someone start another ""Why doesn't everyone post fish reports?"" thread."

987671,reelingMachine,2016-12-02 03:56:00,29,"Thank you guys.  No regrets about it and knew that few people would not be happy about keeping the limit. Finally was excited and had something to share, so few posts about fishing this year. Having a one year old to take care of and the wife back at work fished not more than 10 times since ice out, not much luck as well, probably got skunk 4 times including the last two outings, few weeks ago on Sturgeon and about a month ago on another lake targeting pike (from shore). Not a person who keeps the limit for freezer. Kept another limit of pike on the opening day on another lake this year.  This time gave two to friends, the rest mostly for perogies, which are really nice, hope some are left to freeze for another day. If somebody wants the recipe let me know or google. That was Zone 16, the last day of bass season, would love to have a bass on the line, obviously it did not happen, so why not take the limit of pike and give bass and other fish a chance  Fished from shore, initially slowly pulling a rapala flat rap perch. Got 3 pretty fast, the smallest ones, then nothing. Could cast it just few meters beyond high weeds, so mostly fished in a foot of water above the weeds. Fortunately prepared the rig using one of two huge bobbers I bought few years ago for some reason. A big jig head and another bell weight attached directly to the bottom of the bobber, looks ugly, but I could cast it 15-20m farther. This brought the last 4 that were more chunky."

After the New Year go nuts and attack each other.  Every time I go out here on Erie I am hunting for food, no Walleye is getting released here by anyone I know. Smaller Perch, yes, the odd Smallmouth, yes. But I will not be ashamed to take my fish home including a Rainbow.  Nice catch reelingmachine. You go man.  Years ago I was shown how to take out the Y bones. Then one of the Yanks at the camp said ""We eat the Y bones."" Say what Buddy? The strip of meat with the Y bone is added to some fillets and done in the food processor to make fish cakes. Once emaciated with the crumbs, cheese, eggs and spices there isn't a Y bone to be found. My former Father in Law wouldn't let you put a Pike in the boat. Then one day my BIL and I kept a nice Northern for the weekly fish fry. Fed Dad the Pike and he never knew the difference and swore it was a Walleye and we were full of it."

Never a worm and a sore on them is rare. Talking to my kid brother just now and he reminded me we just cut the entire back off and then used that piece for the Pike Cakes. Cut into 2"" chunks and into the food processor. A few pulses and added salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, dried oregano, Italian bread crumbs, eggs, and Parmasiano cheese. If too dry added 1/2 and 1/2. Made burger size patties and then egg wash, bread crumbs and fried or baked to a golden brown.
