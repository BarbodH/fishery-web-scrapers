988794,porkpie,2016-12-16 01:40:00,2521,I remember nearly burning the hut down once cause we where so hammered we couldn't see straight to re-gas the stove properly with white gas.  I stopped on the beer after that incident!

Lots of chilli We've been going up to Temagami every February since 2001, and we all bring enough food for an army ... We actually tried ceviche on the ice one time using fresh walleye , it was actually delicious , I found out later that you shouldn't do that with fresh water fish only salt water fish but we were fine. Always went back out to the hut around 10 pm for the ling fest , as we called it ... brought cigars and scotch.... Great times for sure !!!"

You would be what we swarthy olive skinned garlic scented Mediterranean's would be referred to as ""Manga Cakes"".

He was being very official, while checking out our licenses and or catch; but he kept eyeing the burgers. When he was done and starting to put his helmet back on; we asked if he'd like a burger. It was funny the about face in personality, as he polished off a couple of burgers. LOL    Then there's the indoor cooking station, where the home-fries or whatever sides that we bring out.    We don't go hungry; for snacks we have kielbasa, deer pepperettes and enough different cheeses too plug-up an elephant.

988746,DanD,2016-12-15 18:43:00,2223,LOL guys about the hut. Thanks  You guys never head of Lox & Bagal? I make it all the time at home. It's done more or less the same way you would dry brine a salmon filet for smoking; but you don't heat smoke the meat. After the fillet has been in the brine for as little a 2 hours or up too 24; you wash the brine off in cold water and pat it dry. Then you slice the meat as thin as you possibly can. Coat a bagal with cream cheese and then load it up with the slices of salmon. I've also cold smoked the fillets after the brine; cold smoking doesn't cook the meat or change the tender flesh; but gives it that perfect smoke taste.  Dan.

Last year we ordered chinese food and did rock paper scissors for who was gonna ride the sled in to grab it. Basically, anything and everything on any given day, we have dragged out the webber and done a full charcoal barbaque so id say no food is safe nowawdays.

988657,NAW,2016-12-15 00:53:00,4022,Great post!  Lots of members are extra pumped for the ice this year!  I try to keep it simple.  I spend a few nights on nippising each year.  So we need to bring a few meals.  Usually we plan one night at the pizza joint in Calendar for a dinner and a few pints.  Quick and easy walk back to the hut after.  I bring my Coleman grill for the other meals.  Chilli is wicked easy to heat up. Usually made with goose meat from the past hunting season.  Irish whiskey.   Lots great memories.  My girlfriend peed inside the hood of her floater suite once...  Tragic mistake.  I almost died laughing.  Literally.  I almost died I was laughing so hard.  Ive never seen a look of such shame before in my life..   Can't wait for this season!  Make some more great memories!
988658,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-15 01:03:00,8243,"Man as my dear friend Len Malloni (rip)  would say "" You are a Man after my own heart."" Thanks for starting this thread npt1, it should be a good one. Food in the hut and ice fishing is what gravy is to Turkey, cheese is to burgers, eggs are to ham. One is great but even greater with the other. I was always more excited about the breakfasts, lunches and dinners when we stayed on the ice over night as I was excited to catch a fish. We never got skunked when it came to eating, ever.  #1 go to was always a pot of spicy Chile and 1or 2 loaves of round crusty fresh Calabrese bread. That would be for 2 guys. I remember giving a few guys in the hut near us a bowl and they came back and asked how much $ for a second bowl. No charge buddy, enjoy.  #2 was a fish fry from water to pan. Nothing better. I always brought my Wok that I still have had for her 30 years. One pot cooking. A zip lock bag of bread crumbs and a bag of pre mixed eggs with secret spices in it. No need to wash the Wok it is seasoned so well.  #3, Pea Meal, bacon, pre boiled tater home fries,and Calebrese bread toast for breakfast in the AM. Sometimes at 04:00 in the bungalow to soak up all the Crown and Coke.  We never brought Chip, peanuts, popcorn etc. Why fill up on stinky food not good for you when you can have a chunk of good Genoa salami or Prosciutto and a chunk of Asiago, Parmassiano,  Fontana or Friulano cheese with crusty Calabrese bread.  Ah man I almost forgot, sausage and peppers in the Wok, and guess with what, a loaf of crusty Calabrese. Calabrese bread was as important as minnows. Ooops almost forgot the zip lock bag of home made roaster red peppers. Nothing like a salszeech and peppers sangwich. Melt some Fontana cheese on it and fergid aboud it.  Then there was the time I breaded and fried up all the dead shiners laying on the ice inside the hut on the last afternoon once and Big Janko my good Hervatski giant of a friend ate them after I had a handful. Actually came out not bad, too much salt maybe. And that meal will never be forgotten. Janko once challenged a CO to race sleds for ownership after a bottle of Stock 84 disappeared before lunch.  I can't wait for our 35 year reunion this winter on Nipissing. We will probably all be in bed by 9.  We are going to miss you Lenny."
988660,manitoubass2,2016-12-15 01:07:00,11391,"I always bring fried bread and chilli.  Here is a dumb story.  About 5 years back a buddy of mine wanted to ice fish at night for ling and walleye.  I was game for an allnighter down at my shack, should be a great time.  He shows up with a case of tallboys and im just thinking ""ok, should be a fun walk home in the morning""  We walk down to my shack and get set up. Its pretty friggen cold, -25 or -30 ish. Propane is on and beers are going down good, we get into some decent fishing action around 11pm.  I cant drink like I used too, so after about 6 tall boys I gotta good buzz going.  Its all good times until the propane ran out.  Ah well we got beer right?  So we fish away and she starts gettig pretty darn cold!  Now drunk we decide we better head up. Its probably about 3am  Problem was by the time we were ready to leave, both of us drunk, and we are already frozen  Longest stumble home ever. Falling over gear and such like the 2 idiots we are  We get to my place and the unthaw begins. Not fun at all.  We finished off the case and I slept until like 3 or 4 in the afternoon.  Wife wasnt to happy either as I coukdnt fillet the fish so I just threw a limit of ling and walleye in the fridge as is???"
988664,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-15 01:23:00,10439,I generally don't eat when I'm in the hut. Usually too busy fishing. Occasionally I'll take a chocolate bar or two along. I do boil tea in the hut though and have several during the day.
