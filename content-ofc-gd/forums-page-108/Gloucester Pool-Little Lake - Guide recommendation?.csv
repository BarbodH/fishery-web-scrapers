987414,NAW,2016-11-28 21:38:00,4022,I know a few guys on this board who fish the lake quite a bit.  But they don't post much any more.  I've fished there are a few times.  Just head out on a weekend when there's a bass tournament.  The lake gets completely packed with bass boats.. Follow them around.. Most of them know where the fish are!  I don't have a specific guide to recommend.

987421,grimsbylander,2016-11-28 23:05:00,3016,I like the pool. I fished it 2-3 times a week for years before I moved south. You'll like it.
987429,Rizzo,2016-11-28 23:56:00,4754,...sounds like you invite grimsbylander up a few times next year!
987441,skdds,2016-11-29 02:47:00,195,"I fish the east end (near Big Chute ) a lot of times in the summer. Look for my reports. Good bass (LM and SM) and ok pike fishing (numbers) There is current, cover, rocks, weeds, drops offs etc. so adjust tackle accordingly. Senkos, topwaters, Spinnerbaits and drop shots have all been productive. Just try to avoid the summer weekends as LOTS of boat traffic headed out to the lock. I don't know of any guides for that lake. I'd be interested too for new spots. I've heard of guys hooking into walleye and muskie as well, but I've not had great success for those species."
987442,grimsbylander,2016-11-29 03:24:00,3016,^^^^ Hint...Don't try to avoid the weekend boat traffic going to the chute. Sit off the channel and throw your tube into the prop wash of the biggest cruisers. Those fish live in that environment and take full advantage of the disturbance. Those twin diesels are dinner bells.
987448,misfish,2016-11-29 11:48:00,29133,^^^^^ Aint that the true. I did that on Couch one tourney. It was one of my best days..
987449,dave524,2016-11-29 12:25:00,4508,"The party bass fishing boats on the Inner Bay at Long Point, there was a few in the 70's and earlier, used to drag a piece of heavy chain when drifting to stir up the sandy bottom to attract the bass."
987501,skdds,2016-11-30 02:47:00,195,..Well I'm glad I'm following this post I did not think of that perspective!

987630,MSBruno,2016-12-01 22:00:00,369,I've spent most of the day on Sparrow and Simcoe ... hopefully put my years of knowledge to work on GPool and Little Lake...but still looking for assistance to give me a good start.  Nothing beats a day or two on the water with someone who has first hand successful knowledge of the lake and the patterns.
