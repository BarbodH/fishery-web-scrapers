I am sure gobies have helped here but there were big smallies in Lake Erie before they became common? We used to consider it a bad day back in the 1970's if we didn't get at least one 5#er. Fish eat fish? Gobies are small and everything bigger is probably eating them? Walleyes, pike, and even sheephead?  In my younger days I remember catching perch at PAB that were full of crawfish, so every little bit of food helps? A local tackle shop owner and competitive bass fisherman here has been fishing the Lake Erie tournaments for decades, a good day weather wise and a good bite might mean a 30 pound limit for a win, it's really not a new thing?  Glen Lau, a former Lake Erie guide and writer had pictures of huge schools of Erie smallies he took while diving back in the 1960's, people just weren't fishing for them then except during the spring bite. When I had my bigger boat back in the early 1980's in the Erie island area every charter captain at the marina seemed to have a stringer mount of a limit of 4-6 pound smallies."
988075,AKRISONER,2016-12-07 18:39:00,5558," every charter captain at the marina seemed to have a stringer mount of a limit of 4-6 pound smallies. thats what nearly destroyed all of our fisheries in the 1980's  although i honest feel like within the last 10 years we have really turned the corner. Aside from the story in nippising where a commerical fishery has destroyed the fishery...most lakes seem to be recovering nicely and in large part its due to the tighter regulations in place and the exponentially growing sentiment towards C&R practices.  Ohio you fished PAB back in the day, word has it that the walleye fishery on GB is the best its been in 40 years...and im gonna say that I believe it.  No one is fishing smallies out there, but their numbers are ridiculous as well."

No one is fishing smallies out there, but their numbers are ridiculous as well.   I remember for a lot of years in the 60's and 70's there was a big commercial fishing boat ( netter) that was at the public dock by Kennedy's, I am sure that had an effect? I didn't see it there in the 80's as I recall.  Opening  of the walleye season and late fall used to be about the only time you saw walleyes being caught, it was a rough go any other time, although for me it changed in the mid 80's, I got them during mid summer when I bothered to fish for them.  My dad and one of my uncles went to PAB for the opener in the 60's, my uncle got 3 walleye all week, dad got the skunk, but my uncles 3 walleye went around 25 pounds, one was around 10 3/4 pounds. They were around but limited numbers? and concentrated pre and post spawn?"
