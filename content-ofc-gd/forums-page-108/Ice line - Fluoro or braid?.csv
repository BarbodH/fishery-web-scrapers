987533,Sinker,2016-11-30 20:34:00,8692,"What kind of set up?  I use straight (light) mono for pannies, and 15lb braid with a leader for everything else, generally.  S."
987535,jimmer,2016-11-30 20:47:00,2730,I always found that braid froze up on me and gave me problems if outside in the elements. I use something called floro ice by P-Line for pan fish.
987538,porkpie,2016-11-30 21:14:00,2521,"I generally fish from a shelter, unless it's really nice out.  I use power pro braid, generally 20lb with a fluoro leader for most pickerel/pike/laker fishing and 3lb mono on my panfish rods.  I do keep one medium action outfit spooled with mono in case I have to fish outside in the cold."

987541,manitoubass2,2016-11-30 21:15:00,11391,Braid is a no no outside the hut.  These days I like nanofil on the ice with a fluoro leader

987543,esoxansteel,2016-11-30 21:25:00,1307,"Problem with braid is the thin diameter, will burn a line groove in the ice when fighting large fish ie steelhead through the ice, fishing pannies shouldnt be an issue with braid"
987545,AKRISONER,2016-11-30 21:56:00,5558,"same as everything else basically, just altered slightly dependent on scenario   on my 500 series reel for walleye, pike and anything else swimming 15lb pp ice braid - Uni Knot - 17lb flurocarbon leader (too many 5lb+ pikes on GB)  for laketrout 1000 series reel, regular PP with a 10 lb fluro carbon leader.  if you are getting too much line twist...throw in a raven xxxs swivel instead of the uni knot."
987552,Tjames09,2016-11-30 22:22:00,664,OK thanks for the replies guys. It's for a medium rod and mainly for walleye.  Is 6lb fluoro leader good strenth?
987554,Tjames09,2016-11-30 22:30:00,664,Also do you guys use ice specific braid. I see suffix and powerpro make specific ice braided line
987563,DRIFTER_016,2016-11-30 23:12:00,10439,I always found that braid froze up on me and gave me problems if outside in the elements.   I found the same so I went to a coated braid and it's very similar to mono in the way it sheds water. The stuff I use is Tuf-Line Supercast. Used to be called Duracast. It's not ice specific so it comes in bigger spools which is nice. I use flouro leaders on my braid.  Flouro line is terrible in the winter. It gets really stiff and coily.
987565,adempsey,2016-12-01 00:22:00,1498,"Braid with leader, either fluorocarbon, mono or hybrid (e.g. P-Line Floroclear)  If I am fishing deep I use braid with fluoro or maybe hybrid line.  I rarely fish in a hut, and yes the line does freeze up, but it's manageable enough.    It's not like mono doesn't freeze up.  Braid is a bit worse in collecting ice though, but easy to clean off.   For shallow water  (<30feet) I'll use either braid or mono/hybrid.    Braid brands don't matter much to me, but I think I have Powerpro Ice braid.  They're all basically made of the same thing, some are just more round than others.  It's also the one time I will use Trilene Fireline, I find it's actually pretty decent for vertical jigging."

987707,LeXXington,2016-12-02 17:15:00,1928,I like PP braid for the deep drops when you need to feel bottom  Fish mostly from hut
987738,NAW,2016-12-03 00:34:00,4022,"For my walleye/white fish rig, I run 10lb micro-ice braid.  With a 8.5lb Raven flouro leader.  You feel every little tick.    I've use 6lb braid, with a 4lb raven flouro leader on my pan fish rods.   but I also run a few reels with light light mono and a light rod with and extra sensitive tiped rod.  I prefer that..  I have been fishing the micro ice for years, outside, in some very harsh conditions.   Dealing with the ice build up is worth extra sensitive action.  With my style of jigging, I need go be able to feel minisquel details about my lure, at 100' down sometimes.  You just can't get the same feel with mono, IMO."
987868,BillM,2016-12-05 16:34:00,17367,Fireline Crystal for me.
988008,Tjames09,2016-12-06 23:25:00,664,Fireline Crystal for me.  How is that for water retention? I was between that and PP.  The guy at BassPro just said he uses straight mono (trilene sensation) on all his ice fishing rods to avoid line freezeup all together.
988014,Dutch01,2016-12-06 23:53:00,1431,"I use Trilene Sensation for just about everything, it's good line."

The guy at BassPro just said he uses straight mono (trilene sensation) on all his ice fishing rods to avoid line freezeup all together.  I don't mind mono if I'm fishing perch or other shallow fish.  But 100+ft depths for lakers and whities, it's FC.    Water retention isn't too bad, won't notice it inside a hut but if you're outside and the wind is blowing I'll ice up the first few guides after a while."
988018,Raf,2016-12-07 00:36:00,3495,"I can't deal with braid freezing up outside so I prefer mono.  At deep depths you do have to become a line watcher instead of a line feeler though if you are using light lures. Anything looks odd, set the hook -- I usually see the strike before I feel it.  If you are aggressively jigging a spoon, it don't matter braid or mono, they usually smash it."
