988403,Terry,2016-12-11 21:29:00,14456,"yup, but i think all 5 baits  will need to be there to be balanced   and i know damn well the fish will bite the one with no hook  lol"

I like your idea of 2 pickerel rigs.  BTW, anyone know what type of line they use on on pickerel rigs? My guess it is regular mono?"
