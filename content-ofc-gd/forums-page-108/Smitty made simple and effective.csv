987270,misfish,2016-11-26 17:00:00,29133,"  I wanted to make this smitty more versitile. I wanted to add a seat and also have it in the hub with me to so all my stuff was still packed in a dry place.  Put the hub and auger to the back so there was no wieght in the front to drag down the front of the skis. Good call Terry.  Took the seat off the toon and the base just snaps on the lip of the tub.    Just turn the seat and it fits in the tub    Rod mounts, that I just slide on the tube to hold the rods. They slide on snug. Going to add those coiled liner cords and attach to the eye bolt and to the rod. Just encase.      Simple smitty that packs up quick and fits just nice in the truck.      Just need to paint it up."

988067,Headhunter,2016-12-07 16:28:00,5703,"A buddy of mine built a Smitty, not nearly as nice as your Brian, but what he did do, is put steel grate on sections along the lid, so he could put his portable heater in it and sit on it, in the cold. The Smitty was always warm and as everyone knows, a warm tush leads to a warm body. He never uses a hut. HH"
988077,AKRISONER,2016-12-07 19:22:00,5558,the fit in the back of the truck is nifty
