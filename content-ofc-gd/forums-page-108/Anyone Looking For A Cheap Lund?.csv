Crown Assets is listing a 2002 Lund 1650 with a Merc 50 four-stroke and a Shoreland'r trailer on its online auction site. Minimum bid is $1,000. There are only three photos, but it looks to be in decent shape. The description says they ran it this year.  Link to the auction here.  Just for fun, here's a link to a 2002 Lund catalogue with more info on the boat.  I expect it will sell for more than the $1,000 minimum, but this could still be one heck of a steal for someone. Boat is in Port Rowan, auction closes Dec 2. Happy bidding!"
