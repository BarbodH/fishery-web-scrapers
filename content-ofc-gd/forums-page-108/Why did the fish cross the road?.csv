If you are familiar with Youngs Creek , Norfolk County, there is a dam and a parking lot at the town of Vittoria. There had been a lot of rain one fall we figured everything else would be blown, it takes a lot of rain to blow Youngs with the sandy soil so we drove down , much to our surprise the parking lot had six inches of water in it and the crazy Cohos were trying to make redds in the gravel."
