988692,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-15 03:36:00,8243,"It really irks me when seasonal products warranties are really only 1/2 of what they say they are. A lawn mower bought in October and has 2 years on it the warranty is done after 12 months not 2 years. Same as blowers bought in spring on sale.  I'll stick with calling the guy to clear snow until it's not in the budget. We will pay a few hundred bucks a month for cell, internet and TV but kill ourselves clearing snow but won't pay a few hundred bucks a season to someone else and complain about the work. I can get an annual lawn and snow contract for $500.00, 1/4 or less than the TV contract price etc. And no shovelling snow is not exercise, not good pain, it's bad pain. Just the price of physical therapy, acupuncture and pain meds I won't need is worth it. Show me someone that enjoys clearing snow and I'll show you my scars."
988693,manitoubass2,2016-12-15 03:37:00,11391,I like clearing snow and look at me! 37 in picture perfect health???

988732,fishermccann,2016-12-15 15:25:00,655,"I must say that I have never had a problem ordering things from TSC online, and having them ship it to their Uxbridge store. Always there on time, and what I ordered."
988756,Garnet,2016-12-15 20:07:00,2056,Go into store and ask for 1 more of anything. Life is short.
988757,Big Cliff,2016-12-15 20:11:00,6899,That's the exact same snowblower that the manager wouldn't honor the sale price on for me last Sunday!
988493,Garnet,2016-12-12 22:16:00,2056,And on the 4th pull.
988495,SirCranksalot,2016-12-12 22:31:00,3291,"Big contrast with my local HH. A few years back we bought a patio set on sale there. A couple of days later there was a further price reduction. When I wandered into the store looking for a couple of nuts and bolts the clerk who sold it to us tracked me down and said they would refund the price diff. between what I paid and what it was now on sale for. Needless to say, they won a loyal customer that day! Mind you, the service is generally very good there anyway."
988497,GBW,2016-12-12 22:38:00,8460,"I always find TSC so unorganized.  Mainly no price tags or items not in the proper spot on the shelf. Same, I thought I was getting a good deal on an item to find out I wasn't when I got to the till..."
988499,SirCranksalot,2016-12-12 22:47:00,3291,If the sticker shows the low price they are legally bound to honor that price.

Thier effort to give thier customers the best they can is above and beyond IMO. Always looking to satisfy. They dont have it on the floor, they go searching and see if they can bring it in. It,s amazing the products they can get and for the price."
988505,GBW,2016-12-12 23:41:00,8460,If the sticker shows the low price they are legally bound to honor that price. The time I'm talking about they over stocked the one shelf and put a few more on the lower shelf and didn't take the tag away for the item that should have been there.  I needed the item either way but I thought I was getting a deal.
988506,manitoubass2,2016-12-12 23:42:00,11391,HH also has my vote.  Unreal good service.  This being a small town helps too. I know all the employees and they really will bend over backwards to please a customer.  Plus they give me an awesome sponsorship for my ice fishing derby. Scott(manager) basically lets me go through the store for anything I need or want within reason. I even snagged up 4 buddy heaters 3 years ago and thats pretty pricey.  They also give me jigs for free so thats pretty friggen awesome!
988508,GBW,2016-12-12 23:46:00,8460,I know all the employees and they really will bend over backwards to please a customer. Does the Mrs know that your location does that for you?!?!?!?!
988513,manitoubass2,2016-12-13 00:17:00,11391,"Yes, we get down like that???  Hahaha frig geoff"
988514,GBW,2016-12-13 00:19:00,8460,"Yes, we get down like that  Hahaha frig geoff "
988534,canoecarrier,2016-12-13 11:12:00,54,"Everytime I go to TSC  (Lindsay)  looking for something I walk out pissed off, alot of the time you can't even find an employee and when you do, they have no idea and try to go ask someone else. I will never go back, save yourselves the trouble and frustration. Peterborough is just as bad."
988535,Garnet,2016-12-13 11:31:00,2056,I appreciate the offer Cliff. I'm going to see what the issue is and decide.
988545,SirCranksalot,2016-12-13 14:05:00,3291,"Now that the OP has gotten his rant in, maybe a little 'topic drift' is OK.  IMO, in going to big box stores such as H Depot for a lower price rather than a local hardware store for better service we are trading time for money. Many have taken too literally the old mantra 'time is money"" Well, that's a lie! You can make more money but you can never, ever make more time!"
988556,Ralph Field,2016-12-13 18:08:00,1018,TSC has many one day sales. If you want it you have to buy it when you see it.
988557,jimmer,2016-12-13 18:14:00,2730,"Yes, they do have some good deals once in awhile."
988578,Garnet,2016-12-13 23:38:00,2056,TSC has high quality products.  Don't every try to order something into your local store. You could likely catch Atlantic salmon in the Scugog river easier.
988633,dave524,2016-12-14 19:47:00,4508,"FWIW  the new TSC flyer I got today, has a Bolens 22inch 179cc two stage snow blower with electric start on sale for $549.99, sale starting tomorrow, actually a little better than the original one in this thread as that one was a single stage I believe. If anyone wants to take a chance on them having one when the doors open tomorrow."
988635,SirCranksalot,2016-12-14 22:19:00,3291,and if you find one buy a lottery ticket  on your way home. It's your lucky day!!

988659,leaf4,2016-12-15 01:03:00,2466,"Bolens are nice, my dad has had his for 7 years. My brother ended up breaking something on the chute mechanism one time while loading and it was fixed under warranty, though I see the one in the flyer only comes with 2 years...

MTD makes them to a certain price point and quality for others , their own Gold machines are top notch."

988406,Big Cliff,2016-12-11 22:13:00,6899,"Saturday Sue and I stopped in at TSC here in Lindsay to pick up some Suet blocks that they had advertised at 50% off, only problem was that they had raised the price then advertised them at 50% off which was still higher than I normally pay for them not on special. Needless to say I didn't buy any.  While I was there I noticed a snow blower on special, nothing fancy but it would have done what I needed and it was only $529.99. We were on our way to a friends for our annual Christmas G2G and I didn't have room in the car so I decided I'd just stop in on our way home today. This morning when I got up there is a weather advisory; 10 to 15 cm of snow on the way, yup going to get me that snow blower on the way home!!!!!  We get to TSC before lunch and that exact same snowblower is now priced at $649.99. I talked to the clerk and he agreed that yesterday it was priced at $529.00 but maybe the sale had ended and only the manager could authorize it to be sold at the lower price.  They paged the manager, they phoned the manager, finally after about 15 minutes the manager called them back and told them he would not honor the lower price,if I wanted it I would have to pay the $649.99.  That will be the last time I shop at TSC for anything!  "
988408,ecmilley,2016-12-11 22:23:00,2163,Have all the luck don't u? Usually.I find.they don't have what's advertised but never seen.anything like that
988409,okumasheffield,2016-12-11 22:23:00,318,Looks like TSC has finally caught up with what most retailers do nowadays!
988410,DaveRoach,2016-12-11 22:28:00,202,"Based on your experience I will no longer shop there,  spread the word........"
988411,Old Ironmaker,2016-12-11 22:29:00,8243,That manager is answering to someone in an Ivory Tower in Toronto. He has about as much say in a discount once a sale has ended as the check out girl at the register. Now the franchisee could have honoured that sale price. The mgr. may have made the call and the owner said no. I don't know.
988412,woodenboater,2016-12-11 22:38:00,2277,was it in the latest flyer ? that would be a bone worth fighting over if it was. unless they have super fine print
988414,GBW,2016-12-11 23:21:00,8460,"When I got my BBQ there and knew I was 100% buying it I paid for it and said ""I'll pick it up tomorrow when I have the truck"" so I got the sale price and they put it together for me at no extra cost.  Went back on the Sun with the truck and it was $150 more as the sale had ended.  So I hear ya there Cliff.  IF you ever go back in there and you know you are 100% going to get it pay and tell them you will come back and get it later with a better way to get said larger item home. Now, some of the managers at the CTC in town are great and have been known to give ""the last sale price"" on some things. Do stores still do a ""raincheck"" if out of stock or explain why you cannot buy on the spot?"
988416,GBW,2016-12-11 23:25:00,8460,was it in the latest flyer ? that would be a bone worth fighting over if it was. unless they have super fine print I have the most recent flyer and no that one was not one of the 3 listed.  The lowest price unit in the flyer was $949
988418,huzzsaba,2016-12-12 00:02:00,884,"Looks like TSC has finally caught up with what most retailers do nowadays! I tell my wife, there is no point shopping on Black friday or boxing day since I don't really see any deals. Some stuff maybe, but for the most part, I think they just raise the price and give the discount and people blindly buy thinking they are getting a good deal.  Sometimes people don't look at the price, just the fact that they got a good deal, or so they think!  End of the season deals are the best IMO if you are quick to get them before they run out!"
988420,ketchenany,2016-12-12 00:16:00,3229,"50% off is  called a loss leader, meaning we will sell you this and hope you buy something else. And they are making a profit on the loss leader! I do work for a major Canadian retailer (not CTC) and if you ever read the ""fine print"" IF you can read it it has all sorts of as they say exceptions. The best I've seen is nothing with prices ending in $.99 or 00. Just last week I had an item at 85% off and if you use their credit card at 19.99% you get and extra 25%!!! Holi they are paying you! Does't work that way when I questioned them IT'S 25% off the price that is listed!!!  So I figure they are making a huge profit and just printing numbers for us to swallow and rush in!"
988421,woodenboater,2016-12-12 00:26:00,2277,"When I got my BBQ there and knew I was 100% buying it I paid for it and said ""I'll pick it up tomorrow when I have the truck"" so I got the sale price and they put it together for me at no extra cost.

When someone here posted about a sale on a Masterbuilt smoker at TSC, I called them up and paid over the phone to be picked up down the road. Too late for you Cliff but maybe call another store to see if they have it on sale and hopefully can ship to your local store."
988422,smitty55,2016-12-12 00:27:00,928,"I don't know how much say the TSC manager has in regard to sale prices, but one thing for sure is that no matter what store it is, all sales have an expiry date. In your case Cliff it seems like the sale date had ended, so I think you may be reacting overly harsh over this. Did you check the sale sign for an expiry or ask a salesperson if the blower was still on sale the next day. If not then I think you should take some of the onus on this. Just sayin'.  Cheers"
988425,bigugli,2016-12-12 00:40:00,6138,"TSC stores will have all sorts of in house sales. Not advertised, and ending when convenient for the store ( as in when inventory levels are acceptable) We do purchase farm supplies there, and know that you grab the deal the day you see it. The local manager told us that many of the sales are at the discretion of head office. Stuff moves too quickly, they just take the item off the floor."
988426,GBW,2016-12-12 00:53:00,8460,"Not advertised, and ending when convenient for the store ( as in when inventory levels are acceptable) We do purchase farm supplies there, and know that you grab the deal the day you see it. This is true for ALL bigger retail stores.  Example.  My parents got an outdoor patio sectional set from Lindsay CTC @ 45% off and the store closer to them had 1 left in stock at FULL price."
988430,porkpie,2016-12-12 01:57:00,2521,"Yep, TSC is crap for stock, and service is marginal, but if it's on sale online I've had very good luck ordering to the store.  I will agree that if the sale is over, well I guess it's not their fault.  I will say that often CTC will honour a sale price if it's within a couple days and you ask very nice, but CTC is pretty good about most things, and their clearances can be unreal. I cleaned up on tackle, electronics, floater suit etc. Last month!"
988438,crappieperchhunter,2016-12-12 04:11:00,2582,Sorry to hear Cliff....but I have had similar experiences at the TSC here in Bowmanville. Bottom line I won't do business with them anymore and don't even check there flyers anymore. Life's to short to deal with shysters.
988441,GBW,2016-12-12 05:05:00,8460,"Cliff, I'm done work at 530pm tomorrow and willing to go in on your behalf and see if they would be willing to help out.  I'd even put it on my visa and you pay me if so.  Your call but you have to TEXT me and you have my cell # if you want me to try for you."

988443,Big Cliff,2016-12-12 09:32:00,6899,"It wasn't advertised in the flyer or I'd have gone in prepared to buy it. It was sitting out side the front door whit a big ""Screaming Deal"" price tag on it, that was Saturday afternoon. By Sunday morning (and after the snow fall advisory had been posted) the exact same snow blower had a ""Screaming Deal"" price tag on it but it was the higher price.  As for CTC in Lindsay, they have always been awesome to deal with and will often honor a sale price days or even a week later.  GBW, thank you so much for the offer but my neighbor came over last night, he just got a new plow for his ATV and wanted to know if I would MIND if he cleaned my driveway this winter (just big enough to park 4 small cars). This place is amazing!"
988455,jimmer,2016-12-12 14:07:00,2730,I always find TSC so unorganized.  Mainly no price tags or items not in the proper spot on the shelf.

I've yet to run into any problems at TSC Barrie, although they never ever have any of the big sale items in stock - seems like it's always a week or two later that the product finally arrives."
988460,manitoubass2,2016-12-12 14:23:00,11391,Nice to hear big cliff! Thats certainly a nice gesture!  Our TSC is awesome so I dont have much to complain about. I might get a little special treatment though as I was the project manager building the new store about 13 or 14 years ago lol.
988462,Garnet,2016-12-12 15:20:00,2056,Put new gas in my snow blower this morning and on the 4th pull it seized.  I will have my guy check it. Likely in market for a nice new one.
988465,jimmer,2016-12-12 16:42:00,2730,The motor seized or the recoil seized? Weird how it would seize without running.
