988223,dave524,2016-12-09 13:18:00,4508,"That's pretty far south for a purebred wolf, even Algonquin Park wolves are a mix of Gray Wolf, Eastern Wolf and Coyote. I understand most of the southern Ontario coyotes have a bunch of Red Wolf genes in them they picked up on their eastward expansion through the midwest. I'd hazard to guess anything south of the French Mattawa river line is pretty much a Heinz 57 , maybe favouring one set of characteristics over the other."
988263,grimsbylander,2016-12-09 20:23:00,3016,"I'm not sure the location would be the limiting factor. 25 years ago I had a ""wolf"" tracing my steps along a path towards me in an area not all that far from Barrie. Not a agricultural area. I owned a purebred male male sheppard at the time and this thing dwafted it. Frankly, it froze me in my tracks. I was 5 miles from the nearest road in the middle of a wetland and carrying a recurve. When it walked, it's head hung low and swung back and forth. At about 12 yards I came up with the bow and it saw the movement...it made two leaps and was GONE! Two things I still remember... how massive the head looked as it approached and it's length as it leap to my right. Who knows but I still remember every detail of that animal."
988266,manitoubass2,2016-12-09 20:36:00,11391," Not sure if you remember my story I shared on here?  But ice fishing I was cornered by incredibly deceptive pack of timberwolves.  It was amazing! And incredibly scary as well.  I was ice fishing with my kids on RR. I was parked about 400 yards away up a hill.  Bout 330pm there was a lone wolf that appeared 100 yards west on the point. Howling away. No worries. Abit later 2 wolves howling.  Well dark is coming and I had to haul up the smitty by hand. So I gave the kids the keys and told them in the vehicle and sit put. Turned out a good call.  I unloaded one smitty and headed back down for more gear. Now its dark and those wolves are still howling. I get our stuff and notice the 2 wolves are gone. Now im a lil nervous and head up as quick as possible.  I get the gear to the vehicle, load it in.  I turn on the vehicle and my headlights reveal 6 wolves not 15ft from my vehicle in some brush!  Amazing plan of ambush? Or coincidence?  Not sure but if it was a plan or not but to me, its seemed an effective way to gather and surround us!  They never made a move though thankfully, and im sure glad nobody got out to pee or something  Those were some huge wolves!!!"

988301,manitoubass2,2016-12-10 15:57:00,11391," They are amazingly smart! Ive watched them hunt a deer on open ice and it was incredible what they did(at least do me)  Forced it near open water where one leg eventually fell in. Then 3 wolves reamained taunting it from the front, 2 snuck off and came back from behind.  One grabbed the upper thigh, the other the kneck.  It was over in 5 mins or so"
988303,Rizzo,2016-12-10 16:18:00,4754,I got $5 says its a Snufflepagus...and if you catch a picture of the elusive beast that's worth $10. Look for yellow feathers in the vicinity and you know you are on the right track.

988579,Carp,2016-12-14 01:12:00,1488,"I have no doubt there are large wolves in the Barrie area and around Lew's place as well.  Several years ago, I was bow hunting in Mt.Albert, just N/E of Newmarket ON. I was in a tree stand about 15 feet off the ground.  A large doe runs out into the field and followed the edge of the bush, which made a zigzag around me. She was winded and obviously being chased. She disappeared into a small gully, where a tiny stream ran out from the bush and into the field.  About 4 or 5 min. later, in the same corner of the field where the deer first appeared, I see three wolves pop out and stop and looking at each like they were having a conversation. One was about the size of a large German Sheppard, but the colours of a Husky. Two were all black and twice the size of the Sheppard sized wolf. Absolutely HUGE !!!  Amazing to watch them formulate a plan to trap the doe. One wolf doubled back to cut off the deer as it tried to circle around back into the bush. The other two followed it to push it towards the third wolf.  I walk through the forest in the dark all the time while hunting. Either going in at morning, or coming out in the evening. I don't give it a second thought, but I've never been as nervous as I was that day and it was daylight on my short walk back to my truck. Made as much noise as possible. Talking out loud, coughing and banging tree trunks as I walked quickly towards my vehicle.  I've seen moose as far south as Bradford, ONT. Yes, I know the difference between a moose and a horse. Definitely moose.There were bears spotted in Milton, Burlington and Newmarket, very recently as well."
988580,manitoubass2,2016-12-14 01:23:00,11391," I dont see alot of timberwolves as im basically in norther MN, but ive seen maybe 3 packs or so and they are ginormous! Id guess 160lbs or so but with that thick coat they look well into the 200s  An unarmed man would stand zero chance surviving  Thats cool Carp! Amazingly calculating animals. Cool you got to watch from above!!!"
987965,lew,2016-12-06 18:12:00,12766,"We had a fresh snowfall yesterday and this morning while wandering around the back yard I came across the tracks of several different animals but these ones got my attention because of their size.  Definitely canine but they're huge at about 5"" long including the claws and 4"" wide.  There's coyotes around here but not many and I'm thinking these could be wolf tracks but I'm just curious as to what others may think.  I had a critter on my front lawn a couple years back about the size of a German Shepard that I'm absolutely sure was a wolf.  FWIW I'm 3 miles south of Burliegh Falls  These are pictures of 3 different tracks to give you an idea.         "
987971,NAW,2016-12-06 19:35:00,4022,"I would say Coyote.  I think a wolf tracks is about as wide as it is long.   Those are elongated, which would make me think Coyote or a stray dog."

987984,kickingfrog,2016-12-06 20:58:00,8333,"Leaning towards dog or wolf and away from coyote for what that's worth. The pattern and path taken can also help with identifying as well. Wild animals are moving with a purpose, for the most part, while domestic ones have the luxury of wandering much more aimlessly. These apply generally of course but it does help sometime when you're trying to pice things together."

There's a trail that winds through the woods behind me Rob that goes about 1/2 a mile out to the hwy and this fella followed it without veering away. Nice easy walk for anything and I spose he was taking advantage of not having to step around things.  He definitely appears to have had a destination rather than just meandering  There was also fresh deer tracks on the trail basically parallel to the others but I don't know who was there 1st and he eventually wandered off into the trees.  Anyhoo, whatever the critter was it's good to have the fresh snow and see all the activity that goes on after the sun goes down.  Best sighting I've had so far though was this big ole bear that was sleeping in the yard when I wandered out on the back deck  one morning.  "
987988,glen,2016-12-06 21:24:00,2641,"The second pic is the clearest for me.  If that track is close to 4"" long that's a wolf."

987995,grimsbylander,2016-12-06 21:53:00,3016,"It's hard to tell the actual size from those prints. Snow always makes prints look larger because of the way snow recedes or puffs out during the entry and exit. Especially in snow deeper than 1-2 inches. The same animal will look different on snow versus dirt/mud. In this case, at best you'd have to measure down in the bottom with a pad to pad measurement and allow for some natural melt back. Any idea how old the prints are? If they're fresh...under a couple hours max, the fact it compressed the snow down to the fallen leaves indicates a heavy animal. If they from the previous day, the temperature would have played a part in that, and the size. It certainly looks like a large animal though."
987996,lew,2016-12-06 21:59:00,12766,Any idea how old the prints are?  We got 5-6 inches of snow yesterday so those tracks were made last night sometime....or early this morning. It was mild over night and above freezing today so there was certainly some snow melt.
987999,SirCranksalot,2016-12-06 22:29:00,3291,What makes it confusing is that the coyotes in S. Ont are rarely purebreds. Most have been crossed with wolves  as they came from the West and spread to Ont.

988062,jimmer,2016-12-07 15:30:00,2730,Maybe a Coy-dog.
988066,manitoubass2,2016-12-07 15:41:00,11391,KF has it correct IMO.  Thats a wolf.  A dog doesnt go point A to point B.  A coyote(brush wolf) will but youde likely see many more and frequent tracks
