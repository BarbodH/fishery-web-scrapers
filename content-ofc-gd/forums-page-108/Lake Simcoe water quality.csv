Area residents can do their part to help, according to Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change officials. The ministry released its annual Lake Simcoe Report this week and it shows the health of the lake has improved and some native fish are showing signs of recovery, according to spokesman Lindsay Davidson.  “This progress follows implementation of the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan which began in 2009 to improve water quality in Lake Simcoe and protect fishing, people’s enjoyment of the lake and the local economy,” he said. “The plan sets out specific commitments and actions by key partners to reduce phosphorus, restore the cold-water fish community and improve environmental conditions around the watershed.”  Davidson said the plan encourages everyone to help improve the lake and its watershed. “Whether you are a farmer, resident, visitor, boater or angler, you can protect Lake Simcoe,” he said. “There are plenty of tips on how you can do your part to improve the health of the lake. “Fertilize moderately; more is not better. Fertilizers can pollute the water, promote algae growth and threaten the fish,” Davidson said. “Apply fertilizer only as needed, avoiding pathways, roadways and driveways.” Minimizing winter salt use is also important, he said. “More salt doesn’t always mean more safety.” Leaving shorelines as natural as possible will help to avoid erosion of sediment and preserve the ecosystem, he added.  “Sediment can clog fish gills and smother aquatic life. It can also carry nutrients like phosphorus into the lake,” he said. “Help keep those out of the lake by maintaining native plants and trees along the shoreline, both on land and in the water. Plant native species instead of exotic or invasive plants.” Residents should have their homes’ septic systems checked on a regular basis and cleaned every three to five years. “Household wastewater can contain nitrogen, phosphorus and disease-causing bacteria and viruses,” Davidson said. “Don’t put garbage, medications or food waste down the toilet. Garbage and food will decrease the effectiveness of your septic system.” Directing roof water into landscaping to allow it to soak it in, as well as building up your soil with compost while planting gardens or lawns is also helpful, he added.

I can remember seeing nothing but rocky bottom. I now see green. Nothing but green growing algie slop.Then on your way back, travel along the south shore from say, Bear point, just down to say, a mile or two. Tell me how many new street out flows you see.  Talk about the salt thing. You should of seen the thick layer that was on the QEW. UNREAL. And there was no real reason for it."
