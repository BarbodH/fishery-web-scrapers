Yesterday I got an email showing my full name, address, postal code (I hadn't included any of that) ********************************************************************************************************************* From: ""Prime Minister/Premier Ministre"" <[email protected]>To: <[email protected]>Subject: Office of the Prime Minister / Cabinet du Premier ministreDate: Wednesday, December 09, 2015 1:22 PM    Dear Friend: Let me begin by thanking you for your kind words of congratulations.  I am deeply grateful to have this opportunity to serve you - and every Canadian across our great country. I was touched by the level of support expressed by Canadians on October 19, and I want to reaffirm my commitment to spend the next four years working hard to deliver on our promises.  As a Canadian, you expect to see your values and priorities reflected in your government - and we have listened. Our strong, diverse, and experienced team will be open, honest, and sincere in our efforts to serve the public interest.   Thank you again for writing. Yours sincerely, The Right Honourable Justin P.J. Trudeau, P.C., M.P.Prime Minister of Canada ************************************************************************************************************************** Interesting isn't it? Seems even our PM reads OFC  Maybe he isn't so bad after all!     "

948712,captpierre,2015-12-10 22:11:00,2521,Interesting Cliff Sounds like a standard email response that most would get. Somebody forwarded your post. But how did they get your info?

948740,cram,2015-12-10 23:41:00,1733,That's funny.  (and a bit crazy if it was truly in response to your post on here).
948743,bigugli,2015-12-10 23:55:00,6138,Your open letter to Justin would have popped up on any google search using his name. Every party has PR geeks watching public commentary through all social media
948744,dave524,2015-12-11 00:03:00,4508,"I was wondering why those black helicopters were hovering over my neighborhood lately, big brother must have been reading my posts here and mainly elsewhere."
948748,ketchenany,2015-12-11 00:19:00,3229,"maybe uncle Wynne will reply to your post about her destroying this place! I complained the that pervious idiot about Hospital Parking rates and got a letter on how much they spend on healthcare, not evn close to an answer. I Gues that I mentioned that our gamblers get free parking while we pay to watch people suffer."

948758,John Bacon,2015-12-11 01:46:00,3277,If like him you can donate $250 to his party he will send you an exclusive cookie cutter in his image.  I got an email about that offer not too long ago.  http://en.cijnews.com/?p=16140
948775,Moosebunk,2015-12-11 05:35:00,3970,"However... or whatever.  Purdy cool you gotta admit, to get THAT from THIS here!  A keepsake from your buddy the Prime Minister of Canada."
948783,Mister G,2015-12-11 12:08:00,1429,And you say you never get anything from the government. Well you better keep that email and treasure it because that's all you are ever getting from the government except for new and higher taxes.....
