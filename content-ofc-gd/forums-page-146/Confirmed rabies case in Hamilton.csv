948195,leaf4,2015-12-06 15:20:00,2466,"Read that the other day, If those were my dogs I'd be getting charged with something"
948209,Joey,2015-12-06 19:51:00,9122,"She loves the dogs so much, like her kids, but can't remember if they were vaccinated for rabies???"
948217,Toronto_Angler,2015-12-06 21:58:00,698,So much wrong here. How do you not keep your dogs up to date with their vaccinations? Especially with kids ???
948219,pics,2015-12-06 22:19:00,1268,"Putting a raccoon in a van with dogs probably isn't the smartest thing to do either... BUT, what if animal control was only planning to relocate the problem coon to a new area?? We would never have known about the rabies.. I'm going to have to be vigilant about them.. who knows how many around are rabid!!"
948263,OhioFisherman,2015-12-07 15:25:00,6623,My vet sends me a notice when my dog's shots need to be renewed? I also have a folder with his vet bills and shot records in it.  I don't like to see Racoons or Skunks wandering around my yard!
948701,pics,2015-12-10 21:38:00,1268,There's a helicopter flying over the house dropping vaccination baits in a grid pattern... I'm safe now!!
948702,leaf4,2015-12-10 21:39:00,2466,Yeah they found another 3 or 4 in doing some trapping
