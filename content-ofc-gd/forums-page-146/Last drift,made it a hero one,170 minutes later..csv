It,s always the same thing we all do. One more cast,one more drift. I decided to let my float go as far as it could on my last drift. I could see the bright green river master float very well. Well,even at 20-30-40-50 yards. Then it went down. Bottom,maybe, set,and wouldnt ya know it,the fish was way down the other way from where I was fishing.LOL  It just swam right up the river to me. A bit of bull dogging and in the net she went. Thats how a last drift of the day should end.    Seems the quit smoking is doing me well , and I need to work harder on my high blood presure. That I am trying to do by less work and more fishing.  B"
