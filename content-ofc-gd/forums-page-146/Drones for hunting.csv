943830,captpierre,2015-11-08 14:15:00,2521,Just caught a CBC Radio piece about the use of drones with cameras to spot prey or even herding them towards the hunter. Banned in Alaska and some western provinces. I'm thinking drones to be over the top. Then is sonar and now SI any different on the water? Gotta figure out how to herd  fish to the lure. ?
943833,porkpie,2015-11-08 14:33:00,2521,Hunting with a drone isn't hunting in my opinion.
943850,dave524,2015-11-08 15:21:00,4508,In several jurisdictions it is illegal to big game hunt the same day as you are in the air to discourage aerial spotting. Looks like drones are a way of circumventing that rule and should be banned as well.

943897,wkrp,2015-11-08 22:01:00,656,"Why use drones for spotting , when you can mount a rifle and go for the kill with GPS co- ordinates included. Too bad they arent powerful enough to deliver your kill to camp. Technology is blowing mind."
943904,dave524,2015-11-08 22:39:00,4508,unless it was a huge military type drone the recoil would knock it out of the sky

944123,bare foot wader,2015-11-10 19:45:00,1354,"In BC, the use of helicopters is already illegal for hunting, and the ministry classifies a drone as a helicopter based on the rotary blade. The synopsis has been amended to include specific wording for dones but not the actual wildlife act yet, so it would be interesting to see that case in court.  In terms of using drones to spot or herd game, it's already very popular for guide outfitters to use planes to scout or even herd sheep over a few ridges (and even interfere with hunters who are not clients)....drones don't have anywhere near the flight time that those planes do, so not too worried about that aspect.  In general I'd love to see more aerial enforcement of existing regs, but the mountains are big and hard to enforce that crap, ""evidence"" is typically hearsay  There's some pretty spectacular pictures coming from drones now, definitely cool devices with legitimate uses. I'd love to build one up, seems the older you get the more expensive your hobbies become haha"
944126,jimmer,2015-11-10 20:05:00,2730,"That's not hunting, that's just killing. Man, I think technology is taking the fun out of many outdoor sports.  This is coming from an older guy of course, so the young ones might feel more comfortable with the newer approaches."

Banned in Alaska and some western provinces. I'm thinking drones to be over the top. Then is sonar and now SI any different on the water? Gotta figure out how to herd fish to the lure. Good point on sonar and SI. Back in the 70's when a fish finder was a needle or flashing unit (I still have my old ones) I thought they were just tools to 'HELP' you find structures.  Now with the new electronic technology I watch as rich rookies simply go out with GPS coordinated and pinpoint spots that they bought. Then use the sophisticated sonar to isolate and zero in a spot. Beyond the skill of pressing a a few buttons, they are on fish immediately.  I put my electronics away many years ago and still fish old school. IMO drones for hunting are no different than sonar now for fishing.  I live in northern Ontario, and I watch truck after truck hauling ATV's into the bush. GPS coordinates programmed for known hot spots for deer hunting. Most of the spots are ""baited"" with apples to boot. And this is a sport? They all kill their deer and fill their tags. The tracking and ways of the bush are all but gone. without the technology most of these ""outdoorsmen"" couldn't shoot their foot. Drones are just the next phase in the slaughter.  I love technology, but when it removes the true skills of the outdoors, I object to it's uses. Fly fishing has remained simple for centuries. With innovations and improvements in the quality of the gear, you still make and tie on a imitation of and insect and you have to present it it naturally to fool the fish. No batteries needed.  Maybe it's time to push back the technology in the outdoors.  Just my 2 cents........muddler"

947608,tb4me,2015-12-03 01:14:00,3295,"I could see using a drone to find out if animals are around the area your hunting, but using one to shoot or even herd the deer (or what ever) is just wrong..Using a drone to check your area is no different then a trail camera IMO...."
947613,dave524,2015-12-03 01:31:00,4508,"Trail cameras are not live, big difference."
949250,jjcanoe,2015-12-14 23:18:00,744,Not legal in Ontario.  See ask the CO in the most recent OOD
949398,jedimaster,2015-12-15 20:21:00,3472,It is not legal in BC as well. Using a drone or even flying within the last 36 hours is illegal in BC. It makes a lot of sense out there with the mountains and remote areas. Scouting for sheep and goats etc.. As well in Mulie territory way up high it is a huge advantage but was seen as a no no some time ago there. Its not a surprise that using on here would also be illegal. I haven't looked to confirm but it wouldn't surprise me.
949399,jedimaster,2015-12-15 20:21:00,3472,Some trail cameras are live if you have 3g access to them.
949401,Jon,2015-12-15 20:32:00,209,"I'm not a hunter so please excuse my ignorance.  Are dogs not allowed to run deer in some WMUs? Aren't they also used to tree bears? If so, I'm not clear on the difference between using a dog and drone. I think it could be argued that a dog is simply an animal drone??  Jon"
949402,jedimaster,2015-12-15 20:38:00,3472,"Well, with dogs yes you can use them, but dogs have been used in hunting for years. I think its the whole technological aspect of it. Like in fishing where some tournaments have restrictions on underwater cameras, anchoring etc... Being a hunter I have no issues against them banning drones for hunting use nor do I have an issue with them banning people from using planes and helicopters for scouting and hunting. Seems a bit too much and takes away a lot of the adventure aspect of it."
