949127,shimano19,2015-12-14 02:22:00,196,Was fishing the river today and had an issue with knots breaking. I'm using froghair 6lb floro for float fishing. Smaller diameter than other 6lb in the market. I generally use a Davy knot and it holds up well but today I snapped 3 fish off at the hook or swivel and not horsing them much. What are some knots you guys use with good strength. Thanks
949130,SirCranksalot,2015-12-14 02:27:00,3291,"Palomar, but not sure about it on fluoro"

949144,chris.brock,2015-12-14 04:15:00,4053,"Sounds like garbage line  I'm no expert, JMO, improved clinch is what I do on flouro and mono, and I can't complain"
949146,adam lancia,2015-12-14 10:31:00,234,Have you tried a San Diego Jam...?
949149,muddler,2015-12-14 12:09:00,623,"Orvis knot. Changed over to this knot about 25 years ago. Used a simple test (below) and it beat EVERY other knot hands down. And , yes I tried them all.  Orvis tippet knot for joining leader to mainline. I now put the line through a piece of cardborad just in front of the leather work glove as the swivel shoots like a bullet if the wrong knot breaks. It is a very easy and simple knot to tie, great when your fingers are frozen.   "
949150,Sinker,2015-12-14 12:11:00,8692,Improved clinch for everything.
949154,bigbuck,2015-12-14 13:25:00,2449,Palomar knot for fluoro. It has never failed me. Trilene for mono and back to back uni for joinng lines. Those and the overhand are the only knots I know.
949155,Ralph Field,2015-12-14 13:39:00,1018,I also believe in the San Diego Jam Knot ( www.netknots.com )
949157,Lape0019,2015-12-14 13:47:00,647,"I don't float fish but seeing as you are breaking at a swivel or hook, it doesn't really matter. I use a uni 90% of the time with Fluoro but have never used line that thin.  If I am not using the Uni, I am using the polomar knot. They are easy to tie and just work for me..."
949190,BillM,2015-12-14 18:20:00,17367,Improved clinch for everything.  This is all I use for flouro > hook.   Not a fan of Froghair though.
949197,FloatnFly,2015-12-14 19:21:00,1640,"make sure you really moisten the line before locking the knot down, the friction is more then enough to weaken the line  I was the palomar for some lures, but everything else i use the improved clinch.  I use the surgeons knot for joining 2 lines together, great for replacing tippets."
949199,Dutch01,2015-12-14 20:01:00,1431,"I use improved clinch too, and can't recall the last time the knot failed. Maybe a bad batch of line?"
949201,manitoubass2,2015-12-14 20:10:00,11391,All I use is the palomar or double palomar  A rarely tie line to line I just use amall barrel swivels for leaders  Palomar works awesome on fluoro just make sure to moisten before cinching the knot
949207,jtracc,2015-12-14 20:54:00,97,Palomar knot all the way. The line is not junk please don't listen to some people. You also have to remember you need to lube the line before you sinch it down. Slow it down as the knot comes together and use your saliva to lube it up.  By not luberacating the line your creating weak spots in the knot that will fail.  Slow the knot down and lube it.  The old lub comes in handy for a few things eh...
949280,bobowski,2015-12-15 02:40:00,360,I use a Polomar knot all the time. Simplest and strongest knot IMO.
949299,Muskieman,2015-12-15 06:16:00,2472,"I might have to change my name name to "" Knot Man "" just gimme a chunk of rope and I'll show Y'a !"
949301,dave524,2015-12-15 11:09:00,4508,I use a uni knot snell for line to hook on all my steelhead hooks which are all up eye though. Improved clinch for all other connections. I really feel the snell on the shank improves success as opposed to tying to the eye on up eyes.
949303,Garnet,2015-12-15 11:44:00,2056,"The difference in all the knots mentioned is small, less than 5%.  Your most likely dealing with bad line.  Or poor knot tying. If your knot doesn't cense smooth and tight the first time it's a bad knot.   So throw that line out and watch how your knots cense."
949424,SirCranksalot,2015-12-15 22:49:00,3291,The drawback I find with tying a leader-to-hook Palomar is that it uses more line than some of the other knots.  I can do the improved cinch on a limp line like braid but on fine mono or fluoro I loose track of where I'm supposed to thread it back thru or that little 'gap' closes up. I guess it's the combo of my big clumsy fingers and my eyesight.  I wouldn't mind trying that Orvis knot but I can't fancy carrying that chair around!!
949426,mitch seguin,2015-12-15 23:01:00,98,Another knot to consider.
