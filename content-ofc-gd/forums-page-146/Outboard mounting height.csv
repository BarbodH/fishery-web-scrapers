948881,tomkat,2015-12-12 14:00:00,246,Anyone experimented with moving the motor up a hole or two? Mine came on the lowest hole and thought I might try moving it up one. 2015  Lund 1650 rebel xl sport 90 hp 17 pitch prop getting 41mph at 5500 rpm.
948884,NANUK,2015-12-12 14:31:00,797,"Sounds about right for that setup as far top end speed, are having any other issues like hole shot or Getting on plane ?"
948891,KLINKER,2015-12-12 15:58:00,256,I think the plate should be about 3/8 inch below the bottom of the boat.
948893,tomkat,2015-12-12 16:04:00,246,Great hole shot Lund says 43 mph top end. I'll try it 1 hole up see if I get more rpm maybe 1-2 mph more? I guess it doesn't really matter But I read the motor works less if it can get close to max rpm which is 6000 for my motor.
948896,NANUK,2015-12-12 16:28:00,797,Is motor's cavitation plate level with the bottom of hull ?
948897,FishAbout,2015-12-12 16:31:00,106,Most of the time on lunds you can raise the outboard to second hole. I have a lund fury it came lowest hole. I raised it one hole. Got a bit more top speed. Cavitation plate can be level with bottom of hull.
948909,tomkat,2015-12-12 18:10:00,246,First thing I did was go from a 19 pitch 5100 rpm 42 mph to the 17 pitch. That's why I thought the motor may be to low as I think I should have had more rpm with the 19.The hole shot was good but it seemed to porpoise a bit. The hole shot with the 17 is great no porpoising so maybe raising 1 hole is optimum as I should get 200 more rpm. If not drop it back down. I liked the boat with the 19 pitch but was really impressed with the improvement going to the 17. The cavitation plate does look pretty close to the bottom of the hull though.
948972,KLINKER,2015-12-13 04:46:00,256,Are you talking raising the mount or adjusting the trim?
