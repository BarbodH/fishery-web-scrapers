I can and have, for over 29 years, talked on my cell phone with the ability to fully see what is going on around me and IMHO is in no way ""distracted driving"" just having a phone against your ear. That is like saying Mom couldn't keep track of your ass while talking on the wall phone. As for cops doing it, I suspect most times they're updating their facebook status or talking to their girlfriend, they sure aren't talking to dispatch.

When I do a safety inspection on an average sized non commercial vehicle; the only rear light that must work, is the license plate light. As for signals and brake lights, they are not required; but the drivers window must go down (doesn't matter if it doesn't go back up) so that the operator of the vehicle can perform hand signals. That's not a word for word quote from the regs but pretty close. So I don't think the cops can charge you for the actual brake or signal light being burnt out; but likely for improper signal, by not using hand signal?  Dan."

When I first bought my 50 Chev, it didn't have (from the factory) signal lights, just brake lights and I was pulled over by a young cop, saying I didn't signal. I said yes I did, I used my left turn hand signal; he was to the right rear of me and probably didn't see my hand. After I showed him that the car was never fitted with signal lights; he said have a good day and let me go. I have since installed signals lights; I was tired of people waving back at me when I was making a turn. LOL  Dan."

Daoust says, after he replied to a text message while waiting for his coffee at a Beaumont, Alta., Tim Hortons last week, a police officer knocked on his window, asked him to pull over, and gave him a $287 ticket for distracted driving. ""I said, 'In a drive-thru? Really?'"" Daoust told CTV Edmonton. ""He was definitely within his rights…but to me this is ridiculous. It's just kind of heavy-handed."" The Alberta Highway Traffic Act restricts drivers from using a hand-held cell phone, texting or emailing while behind the wheel. The legislation applies to drivers on publicly and privately-owned property that drivers are permitted to use for the passage or parking of vehicles. Jeff Kasbrick, vice president of government and stakeholder relations at Alberta Motor Association, said it's up the discretion of the police officer when to issue a ticket. ""There's the classic, that we see all the time, which is at a red light people will sometimes pull out their cell phones,""Kasbrick said. ""That's considered a distraction."" While Daoust acknowledges what he did, he says he may try to have the ticket fine reduced in court. ""It's stupid,"" he said. ""It didn't have to happen, but I guess that's how it goes."""

People are always quick to assume a cop is on a power trip. Perhaps this gentleman pulled out his Facebook law degree and started acting like a tool and talked himself into a ticket?  Of course he's not going to run to the media and say yeah I was being an idiot and broke the law and lipped off. It's always the cops fault lol"

We had a member of this board a couple years back who saw he had a headlight burned out. On the way home from work the same day he stopped at CTC and bought a new one. He was stopped by a cop who gave him a ticket for the burned out bulb. He had the new bulb on the front seat of his car and the time on the bill proved he'd just bought it a few minutes earlier.  Tell us THAT cop wasn't on a power trip.

But I'll say this, I started almost ten years ago, back then we were allowed to use discretion and judgement. There are procedures now that tell us we shall charge therefore we have no more discretion. I still use it and give people breaks and I choose to deal with the consequences because the laws allow me to do that.  There are however people that are on the jobs that are robots and need to learn discretion etc. and the senior guys see it with the young guys all the time.  As well, with some cops it may not be what you think is a power trip, but a lack of common sense and discretion and it has to do with training. It's the thinking ""I see an offense and I'll give a ticket"". People perceive it as a power trip but it's really not and yes there are guys on the job that puff up their chests and walk around like they don't stink, and usually over time that's a self correcting behaviour lol"
