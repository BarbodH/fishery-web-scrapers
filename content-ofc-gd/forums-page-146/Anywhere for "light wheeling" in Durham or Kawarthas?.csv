948903,Dutch01,2015-12-12 17:03:00,1431,"If you don't want to share publicly a PM would be appreciated...  I'm looking for somewhere I can get my truck dirty. Nothing hardcore, it's my daily driver. I just want to get out in the woods since I can't fish (put my boat away early in anticipation of ice fishing- jokes on me!).  Thanks!  Dutch"
948904,lew,2015-12-12 17:08:00,12766,They used to have trails for dirtbikes in the Ganaraska Forest off the 115 at Kirby but no idea if they still allow it or even let trucks in or not.  I used to do some mountain biking in there but that was 20 years ago.  Maybe worth a phone call.
948905,Dutch01,2015-12-12 17:12:00,1431," I used to wheel my old truck just north of there off of Mount Joy road south of Blackstock but I think they are enforcing private property there now.  I also used to go with some buddies to Shiloh off Ravenshoe, but that place is too gnarly for my truck.  Heck even an old logging road would do. Just want to go for a cruise in the woods."
948910,Fisherman,2015-12-12 18:19:00,7201,"No motorized use after 1 Dec except snowmobile, other times ATV and dirt bike are allowed but you must buy a pass.  I don't think trucks are allowed there at all anymore.  http://www.ganaraskaforestcentre.ca/Motorized_use_FAQs_brochure.pdf"

948915,Dutch01,2015-12-12 19:26:00,1431,My truck is stock (for now). I do have a canoe so if you're willing to share that would be awesome.  Might be best to PM though since it's technically against board rules to post spots.  Thanks!  If anyone wants a good bass lake near Nipissing that they can wheel to send me a PM.

948942,Big Cliff,2015-12-12 22:00:00,6899,"There are some old logging/quory roads off 527 just North of Buckhorn that Beans and I explored in my 4X4 a few years back, they were just rough enough to need the 4 WD but we did manage to get through them without getting stuck."
948955,Dutch01,2015-12-12 23:26:00,1431,Thanks Cliff. ecmilley steered me in a similar direction!
