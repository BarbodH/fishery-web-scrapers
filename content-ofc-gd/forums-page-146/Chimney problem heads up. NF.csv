The mortar around the clay pipes is soft and worn.  Also the mortar that joins the 2 cement caps was loose. Water was getting through and freeze/thaw cycle damaged many of the bricks below. Talking to my engineer bro, seems this is a common problem that only gets worse and results in an irreversibly, badly damaged chimney that would need to be replaced. He told me to chip out all the loose mortar, clean with wire brush and re-cement after wetting old cement first.  Sloping the new cement so water runs off.  Also remove the loose brick faces and repair with cement where possible. Thought you all should know. Fortunately weather is still good enough to do the job. "
948959,wormdunker,2015-12-13 00:02:00,1711,Good point Pierre.  And also I like your cages to keep the rodents out of the chimney.  Another job I should get at.
948962,Fishwilly,2015-12-13 00:18:00,206,Best thing is to get a metal cap bent to cover all the cement then cut holes to fit clay flues. Then use a good polyurethane caulk and you're done.
949009,JoePa,2015-12-13 16:23:00,179,The way your chimney is topped off leaves much to be desired - as you say - the clay flutes should have been a little higher and mortar sloped so that water would run off the edges - the way you have it the water just sits on the top - but it's like everything else when you own a house - things keep needing fixing - a never ending job - my place is now 45 years old and I'm always doing something -
