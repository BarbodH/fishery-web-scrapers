I only use it in the summer when towing our travel trailer or for long trips. Not for daily commute to work. I average about 12 L/100 km without the trailer, but that drops to 22-23L/100 km towing a 5,000+ lb. trailer. I like the 2015 body style changes even more! Enjoy your new ride!"

948315,aplumma,2015-12-07 21:16:00,6896,"Ford F-150: Buyers who go for the 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine on the 2015 version of Ford’s best-selling pickup get a special auto stop-start feature that’s a little different than others out there. Like other systems, this one automatically shuts off the engine as a fuel saver when the vehicle is stopped, but not when the vehicle is towing something or when it’s in four-wheel drive. Without that feature, the tech could prove frustrating for pickup drivers who are hauling something in the rear or are inching along stop-and-go on bumpy or muddy terrain. During all other driving situations, “The engine restarts in milliseconds when the brake is released,” Ford promises.  Cut and pasted.  Art"

I am getting close to 1000Km's on a tank of fuel and man it’s a rocket. I tow a 5000 lb boat and towing is not an issue plenty of power.

Got the new 2015 w/5.0 and I'm much happier! Economy is 11.0 on average, and the truck has more than enough power. If you want to play with the tranny, just switch to Sport mode! Now we are talking! Has the power, sounds like it, and is cheaper than the Ecoboost!"
948491,aplumma,2015-12-08 22:09:00,6896,"The 5.0 is no longer sold here in the states only the 3.7 or the 3.5 eco boost. I personal find the eco boost more than enough power and the torque curve is way better than any normally aspirated motor. I now own 2 eco boost 3.5s one is the truck and the other is the Transit van. Watch for the new Raptor The 2017 is powered by an all-new high-output 3.5L EcoBoost® engine. This new engine gives the 2017 Raptor more horsepower and torque than the previous 411-horsepower, 434-lb-ft 6.2L V8 in the Raptor.  The 2012 eco boost is  365 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, besting Ford's 5.0-liter V8 (360 hp, 380 lb-ft) on both counts. But what really sets the EcoBoost apart is that all 420 lb-ft are available from just 2,500 rpm,  Looking at the numbers the potential of the eco boost tuned is going to be a force to be reconned with in the light bodied mustangs as well as the aluminum trucks.  Art    ​This means better towing as well as acceleration when you want it."
948517,ecmilley,2015-12-09 01:42:00,2163,"nice truck hope it serves you well. wouldnt be intrested in the ecoboosts either, to many issues with them, my dads f150 5.0 has over 200k on  it and really hasnt had any issues other than the cost of the tires, brakes and usual front end issues, has the big fuel tank so regardless how good he thinks the mileage is it hurts to fill it. lol newer tech shows as well, my hemi ram with the 545rfe trans averages 12.9-13.5l overall when not towing combined city hwy pretty good for 400 ponies the newer 8 sp equipped ones doing 11l average so imagine when the hemi gets updated it will get better mileage"

I'm trying to keep miles off the truck it's a 2011 with 160k on it. Hate driving the car but can't afford a new truck in the foreseen future and I don't think the neon will pull the 22 ft glass boat .  But if they actually put out a bronco I'm getting one.
948525,Raf,2015-12-09 03:00:00,3495," the other thing I've noticed in the two years of owning my diesel grand cherokee (mercedes motor not the vm motori in the ram) is how easier than a gasser this thing tows. By that I mean, loaded vs unloaded the difference in mpg is a lot smaller then in my v8 GC and, having peak torque right around hwy cruising rpms means no downshifts and power 'right there'.  i know the cost to fill with diesel is typically more expensive down south but for us here it's about equal to gas when you look at it over 12 months.  personally, i'm sold on diesel power for trucks/hauling.   stick that ecoboost in a mustang then we're talking.  but yes, the f150 is still a really nice truck."
948535,aplumma,2015-12-09 13:09:00,6896,"or you could just get an ecodiesel ram and have 420 lb-ft @ 2000 rpms at the crank & get 28mpg on the hwy to boot.  the other thing I've noticed in the two years of owning my diesel grand cherokee (mercedes motor not the vm motori in the ram) is how easier than a gasser this thing tows.

I ran diesel for 10 years without any issues the mileage was around 22 mpg while the gas is only 16. The hit we take on the price of diesel is harsh some times as high as 60 cents a gallon. Either way you go boosting is the technology that I think is the answer to getting the most out of your fuel dollar. People still remember the days where turbos were brass bushing and poorly balanced things that blew up frequently. The turbos of today are just about bullet proof and I have found people are replacing transmissions before their turbos have any issue. The secret to any mechanical item is to keep it maintained, lubricated and heat is the enemy. It is not to say the 5.0 is not a nice motor it is in my mind only 2nd because of the fine job Ford did building  and designing the eco boost. I have worked on 5.0 and the power and performance we used to unlock was awesome.   Art"

947467,Gerry,2015-12-02 11:59:00,257,"Nice truck, Gallie. When I was in the market for my 2012 F150 I had to decide between the Ecoboost and the 5.0L. Test drives showed equal power and real world reseach showed back then, and continues to show, that the mileage is about equal. So I was left to wonder why they wanted a $2K premium for the Ecoboost. In the end I couldn't reconcile that difference. And added to that, turbos are another thing to repair/replace.  Now, there is a world of difference bewteen the 5.0L and my 2006 5.4L. The new engines are much more fuel efficent and more powerful."

947475,lew,2015-12-02 13:47:00,12766,"You made a good choice with the F150 Gallie and you should be very happy with it.  As for the EcoBoost, I've got a 2013 Lariat with Eco and absolutely love it and my next truck will have one too. Really nice low end torque and that's why I bought it.  If your buying a truck to pull heavy boats and your worried about gas mileage, your making a mistake. If your not too concerned about mileage, buy a truck and enjoy."
947605,steelhedrmatt,2015-12-03 01:06:00,278, It will also tow a lot of weight. My buddy's boat as it sits is 10000# plus With fuel.  Pulled out of launch and towed no problem. I felt it that's for sure but it towed it fairly easy. Smart move on the V8. Mines the 5.0. Tried and true.  Like you I upgraded from a 6.0l ranger. I still miss that truck. Couldn't get it stuck if I tried. But I don't regret upgrading for a minute. Either will you. Enjoy your new ride. Love the colour.
947622,jtracc,2015-12-03 02:18:00,97,"It is a nice truck but does have many down falls.  It's horrible around town, the acceleration is not very good, lowest tow rating for a 1500 and the diesel comes at a premium. Dodge is close but just not there yet.  My buddy has 2014 f150 fx4 black edition with 5.0l v8. Sick truck, going to trade her in Monday v8 too hard on gas.  My boost average around town 13l per 100 km. Highway I average 9 if I drive like an old man 10 120km and 14 with my boat.  This thread is gonna get ugly.  All I know is I have owned v8 now have Eco boost will never go back to v8 (unless mustang  GT). Ford is putting all thier R&D in the ecoboost, there won't be a v8 option in a 1500 in next few years.  Even mustang going  ecoboost. Just is what it is."
947623,irishfield,2015-12-03 02:25:00,26272,I'm still averaging 11.8 l / 100km with my 2011 x 5.0. Add a trip into the city in stop and go and I come home at about 12.4. Worst ever that I cleared off the screen for truck on it's own was 13.8 and that was a summer in Temag with Leah pulling the boat both ways averaged into the equation.... and anyone that's driven with me knows I'm not light on the hammer!  If I pull my heavy flat nosed enclosed I burn 18.9 / 100km.  Had a cop at a ride check in 2012 call me a .... ...... because he'd read my dash. His Eco boost was going through 18/100km and I thought he was going to have a melt down seeing mine at 11.7 !

Also, consider changing out the tires, the wranglers are ok, but not great.  mine lasted 5 years, about 60,000km  switched them out to a commercial grade tire, firestone transforce.  couldn't be happier  for gas mileage,  $25 ~38L to gets me around 115-130km at city speeds with the 5.4L triton V8"
947210,Gallie,2015-12-01 01:32:00,1215,"Its a supercrew, the longest you can get is a 6 1/2' box so thats what i got, would have got the 8' if they put it on with the big cab. I weaseled a set of winter tires rims and sensors out of ford so the wranglers will only be on in the summer and when i kill them ill try find a decent set of tires. The motor is the 5.0l v8 so im not sure if its a big difference from the 5.4 triton"
947225,Rod Caster,2015-12-01 02:11:00,5784,I bet the mileage is better than the Rangers..? My old Mazda truck was awesome in the trails but a turd otherwise
947232,grimsbylander,2015-12-01 02:51:00,3016,"Beautiful truck, congratulations. You'll love driving full size.  You're not going to post your mileage every week are you?? lol"
947233,manitoubass2,2015-12-01 03:08:00,11391,Sweet ride!!!!
947250,Rich Clemens,2015-12-01 11:10:00,3131,"Looks identical to mine ...  But I love the Eco-boost engine.   Same year, same model, and yes - same color !!!     When I need the power it is right there.   Pulls my boat up the PA mountains with ease."
947259,BillM,2015-12-01 12:29:00,17367,You made the right choice picking the coyote over the 5.4.
947334,aplumma,2015-12-01 17:48:00,6896,Very nice truck the eco boost is not something to be afraid of though. I have the eco boost and it gets a full size Ranger boat and a weeks worth of gear from Virginia to Sudbury 14 hours straight doing 60-75 mph with no issues.   Art
947340,Joeytier,2015-12-01 18:28:00,3990,"First generation of Ford truck I can actually say I like the look of.  I would also stick with the v8, especially now with the better performance numbers this gen of trucks have."
947346,Gallie,2015-12-01 18:49:00,1215,"Ya im not gonna complain about 385 hp its more than i need, and no im not going week to week mpg lol, ive heard and seen the bad side of the eco boost and im too chicken to chance it."
