949104,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 01:06:00,296,"Hey guys, anyone use one of the float reels before? I was offered one for $180 ""like new condition"", also was wondering if the drag can be switched off? Thanks for any input."
949108,GBW,2015-12-14 01:27:00,8460,"I've had the Aventa and RawII (2)and both were good for the price. I got the RawII for $189 new so what's the diff with the sirata other than a drag system? Your hand and rod are the drag so why pay more IMO when you can get NEW for the same. After a quick search, it's just adding drag to the spool of the lower line Aventa."
949110,GBW,2015-12-14 01:32:00,8460,If I ever get another float reel I'll be checking the Streamside line.. Streamside Vortex Float Reel as I had a Streamside rod and for the price it was great! https://fishingworld.ca/products/8866-emery-vortex-float-reel-sv400-
949111,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 01:38:00,296,"Thanks for the input, i have a streamside but the startup is trash and handle positions aren't the greatest. Basically just want a reel with ok startup, I know the classic drifter is great but its 235 at least before taxes, where as I can get this one for 180 cash. Also seem a raw 2 for 175 but really dont like the looks of it lol."
949112,MJL,2015-12-14 01:40:00,2427,"Aside from the Angling Specialties Anti-reverse float reel, the drags on every other centerpin reel are just glorified adjustable clickers. The reels with drags operate just like any other centerpin out there. You have free-spool and with the flick of a switch, you have drag-mode (which usually is adjustable). Not really any different than a reel without a drag - ie. Freespool mode and clicker mode."

949122,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 02:07:00,296,"Agreed, looks aren't the most important thing but its nice to have a reel that is pleasing to the eye. Like i said, my biggest worry is startup, since i river fish in the winter quite a bit and the flow is not crazy, what i dont like about the sirata is the handle positions if i fight a fish without the drag, and of course startup!"
949124,GBW,2015-12-14 02:14:00,8460,"The RawII was a great reel for the price. the start up on the one I had was fluid, not a glitch. check the used section too as I'm sure there is a few very good reels out there in your $ range or others thinking of selling what they have may PM you with what they have. Good luck either way!"
949125,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 02:16:00,296,"Thanks, ya i posted a thread on the buy and sell page, i was offered a used classic drifter but still not aure, want to consider all ootions before purchasing."
949131,GBW,2015-12-14 02:30:00,8460,"No harm no foul for asking at all. Good luck with what ever you do. I kind of regret selling my Streamside rod and RwaII reel but I know the new owner will use it more than me rather then it collect dust. Be selective as you don't sound to be on a rush. I'm sure a hell or a deal will land in your lap from someone here should you be able to wait a bit... Remember, Christmas is almost here so some might sell off top gear at a great price due to gifts. Don't rush and find what you like the looks and feel off at your local retailers."
949135,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 02:50:00,296,"For sure, will wait a bit and see, hopefully aomething comes up."
949136,porkpie,2015-12-14 03:18:00,2521,"Nothing wrong with an okuma.  I haven't tried many, but my son asked for a raw 2 a couple years ago because he liked the looks.  Ended up he preferred fishing with one of my drifters, but the raw performed well.  I have a pair of float reels with drags.  I really like them, as sometimes it's a convenience when having to hustle down a steep bank to land a fish, or to get past some trees etc. or at the end of a fight while unhooking.  I've never tried the okuma dragged reels, but I'm sure it would perform ok for the price."
949141,BowSlayer101,2015-12-14 04:02:00,296,Thanks for the input! Does anybody know anything about the blackbird reel? What are your thoughts on it?
