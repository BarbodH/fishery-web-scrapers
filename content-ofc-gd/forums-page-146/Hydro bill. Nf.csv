948193,huzzsaba,2015-12-06 14:49:00,884,Curious why hydro is charged every second month instead of every month.  Or at least that is the way it is here with oakville hydro.  I feel monthly is easier to budget monthly expenses.

High efficiency furnace, hot water, gas dryer and 440 sq/ft detached garage all on NG.  BBQ is NG but that doesn't take much.  Just about all bulbs in the house are LED.  Counter top stove is 1/2 induction 1/2 radiant although we rarely ever use the radiant side.  I think the biggest saving was switching the dryer to gas, the electric bill dropped by about 30%. I would have to say last winter being by far the coldest I can ever remember in the houe, hydro jumped to about $120 for 2 months, but the furnace was really running and I had the truck plugged in a lot. You have basically the same set up as we have right down to the BBG on NG and my bills are very similar. My highest hydro bill is always in the summer with the central air running. Wife loves her A/C even at times when I don't think it's necessary. So with that said my highest hydro bill in the summer is around $120-$140 range, but it could be cut significantly if my wife would cooperate.  You gotta love a house that has been highly insulated and other measures taken to keep those utility bills down.......now my largest bill is the satellite bill but that's discounted as of December 13th......screw them too.....LOL"

946595,jimmer,2015-11-26 15:58:00,2730,I was always wondering about the delivery charges varying on where you live. It's not like I see a truck driving down the road every day to deliver hydro.
946601,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-26 16:43:00,4399,I wonder what the new owners of Hydro One will do  Probably ask/tell you to bend over and touch your toes.....

946617,wormdunker,2015-11-26 19:27:00,1711,Lottsa good info here.  Thanx for your input.  If I may do a little high jacking!  LOL!  Can anybody comment on the use of the on demand water heaters?  I noticed Dara has 1.  Are they worth the expense?  Right now I'm paying $28.00 per month for a rental.
946625,Dara,2015-11-26 20:13:00,3052,"My opinion of on demand water heaters.  They are not instant...you have to have the water turned on for 15 seconds before they fire up. This may not seem long but I find that with that and filling the pipe with hot water..I watch a bit of TV before the shower gets hot. It is a long wait in the kitchen for hot water. You learn to turn the tap on and do other things while waiting. They also don't heat on a really low flow, which can be good because you can use the hot thats in the pipe if you plan things right.   When the power goes out, you have NO hot water.  With a tank, you can get a shower by candle light in the morning  They are a bit pricey..I think its $40 a month rental but they bill you 3 times a year so its kind of a hit. I had electric before this but I think they are cheaper to run so that offsets the extra rental or cost With just 2 of us in the house now it must be better than having that tank heated all the time  They don't take any space and vent out the wall  As long as the power is on, you never have to worry about running out of hot water...great for company or lots of kids taking showers.  Its a personal decision...my wife really wanted it and and loves it and I am used to it..but I'm a miserable old fart"
946633,adolson,2015-11-26 21:01:00,783,"I'm on equal billing and pay a bit over $200/month.  I gotta find my Kill-A-Watt and find out what it sucking up all my usage, maybe put a few things on timers too."
946639,DanD,2015-11-26 22:28:00,2223,"This maybe doesn't sound like much power draw; but all the electronics in the house; that we don't give a second thought too, are constantly drawing power; things like your TVs that are instant on. Most of your electronics are on power bars/surge protectors that have an on/off switch. When we leave for the weekend or on holidays we switch them all off at the power bars. Down at our trailer we had a 25 year old (if not older) beer fridge in the shed. It crapped out and I found a deal on a scratch and dent new fridge; hydro bill at the park literally dropped in half. Comparing hydro bills is useless, unless we are also comparing what's hooked to the far side of the meter. I've been in an all electric home for the last 30 years and people ask me how we can afford the hydro. Our heating is radiant heating coils embedded in the plaster ceilings and the only cost of upkeep is changing the occasional thermostat and that's mostly due to cosmetics. A good friend that's always pipping up about my electric house, has had to but in 2 new gas furnace/AC systems in his house. So by the time you add his electric and gas bill, along with all the maintenance; I'm still hundreds if not thousands of dollars in savings compared to him.  Dan."
946766,Sinker,2015-11-27 19:30:00,8692,"My last place had radiant heat in the cielings. Worste heat I ever had in my life. Expensive, and inefficient. I will never, ever do that again.

When I borrow for a car, the payment is on the total amount I owe, all tax included  You don't get a loan and pay tax on the item as you make payments.  So why are we all paying tax on loan payments.  I could understand if Kate was dinging us a bit extra for provincial tax but she is giving 7% to the feds....for nothing"

947786,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 21:58:00,10439,My cabin is off the grid so my monthly electric bills over the span of the first 10 years (AVG life of batt bank) should be about $83/mo. Then the cost for the batt replacement every 10 years will be about $1500. The original $83/mo is the cost of the entire solar/gen back up system spread over 10 years. The only other expenses during that time will be the cost of oil and fuel for the generator (which will only need to be run periodically during the depths of winter or when running larger power tools).  The initial layout  for my system is in the $8-10K range and will be more than enough to power my cabin.

My actual usage last month was 28$ X2 but mine varies from $125-140 in winter.  I was away all summer at the camp and only my firdge and feezer were on. With delivery charges and usage the bill was $85 every month so that's the lowest I could ever hope for.

946207,Sinker,2015-11-24 20:38:00,8692,"Mine has been around $100/mo so far. Only been in this house since June though. 1500sq ft split level, gas heat, everything else is electric. I haven't turned on any baseboard heaters yet though....woodstove is getting installed next week! I hope to never use them. I'm a hydro nazi.......keep everything to the bare minimum, and stumble around in the dark a lot LOL  S."
946213,wormdunker,2015-11-24 20:46:00,1711,"Sounds like a lot of $$!  My house is 2200 square '.  Heat is forced air gas (Carrier furnace & A/C), dryer, hot water tank is gas.  Gas is 121.00 per month, electric bill is $125.00 average.  Only 2 older people in the house (oops forgot the dog), & we are rather miserly with the use of lights etc."
946216,Raf,2015-11-24 20:52:00,3495,"just checked our bills  gas is 60 / month equal billing - furnace and cooking stove we also heat with wood as a secondary source which keeps the gas bill down hydro is 100-140 monthly - hot water, a/c and everything else  1600 sq/ft  it's hard comparing cost of hydro across provinces/territories.  a hydro bill from quebec or manitoba (lowest in the country) means nothing against a bill in ontario."
946237,Rod Caster,2015-11-24 21:56:00,5784,Mid sized house. Propane cooking and hot water. Wood heat. Average is $120/Mth. My delivery charge is 67 + hst + debt fee. My actual usage last month was 28$
946239,crappieperchhunter,2015-11-24 22:05:00,2582,I don't know what any of you has to complain about. We have a 640 sq. foot one  floor cottage in Bobcaygeon that is all electric.  We have winter tennants and some monthly hydro bills in the winter get close to $700
946250,DanD,2015-11-24 22:37:00,2223,"I dont know how they do this ...?   If it's an older meter, you can (but don't get caught) hang a strong magnet to the side, top or wherever; that you see the spinning wheel slow down and it will be (Just saying) steeling hydro. The new smart meters are all electronic and will not be affected by a magnet. I knew and older electrician that was able to connect before the meter, with a relay system. When the breaker in the panel was turned on, that circuit was fed through the meter, looking 100% normal as far as hydro could see. If you turned the breaker off, the relays would trip and feed that circuit from before the meter. Very cool set up; but again it's steeling hydro and is it worth it for a few buck?  Dan."
946252,Big Cliff,2015-11-24 22:44:00,6899,"It's those darn grow lights they use to grow their ""tomato"" plants Steve.  Our place is 1500 sq ft on two levels, raised bungalow. Propane kitchen range, hot water heater, furnace, and fire place. We have friends staying with us so 4 adults, our average monthly hydro bill is about $184.00/ month"

946285,Fisherman,2015-11-25 00:24:00,7201,"Last electric bill, $68 and we aren't burning candles"
946299,Raf,2015-11-25 01:33:00,3495,That's incredibly low.  What are the details of your home and what is running off gas/propane/oil vs hydro
946300,crappieperchhunter,2015-11-25 01:37:00,2582,"It's those darn grow lights they use to grow their ""tomato"" plants Steve.   LOL...3 adults and 3 dogs in 640 sq ft Cliff...Don't know where the heck they would have room for any ""tomato"" plants"
