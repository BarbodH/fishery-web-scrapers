948925,icefisherman,2015-12-12 20:47:00,952,"Looking for ideas on either buying or making own power ice auger mount for the ATV...maybe a good idea to carry it on front rack and free up some space in the sled/rear cargo carrier. It'll be great if you can post some pictures/ideas.  Is anyone using this digger one Cabelas is selling:  http://www.cabelas.ca/product/66755/digger-ice-auger-carrier  Any reviews on it?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

948940,misfish,2015-12-12 21:59:00,29133,Better. LOL  
948945,Cosmos,2015-12-12 22:28:00,588,"Hi Emil,  I just installed cabelas one on my skidoo. It's really nice, except all coming bolts and nuts are garbage. Pretty simple to install specially on ATV."
948946,Cosmos,2015-12-12 22:31:00,588,Forgot to add - I was looking for different options for quite a while and that one is best one.
948947,icefisherman,2015-12-12 22:31:00,952,"Hi Costa,  is there a way to secure the auger head from spinning in upright position of the gas tank neck? Are you able to send me few pictures of your setup...say via PM?  Cheers, Emil"
948957,wormdunker,2015-12-12 23:29:00,1711,"If you mount it to your front rack, cover the power head with a green garbage bag.  With my Jiffy, gas sometimes spills out a little bit & blows back on to your floater suit.  Impossible to remove the stain."
948961,Cosmos,2015-12-13 00:13:00,588,"Emil, it has special bracket on side to prevent head from spinning. You will have to install it with tap screws for your auger."

Greg,  I believe the tongue weight is about 100 lbs only....loaded hitch mounted rack with much of my stuff in it will weight significantly more than that....I see people have been having problems when overloading the tongue weight.  On the other hand the rear rack is rated for 500 lbs....if I move the power auger to the front rack....the rear drop basket rack with rest of my ice fishing stuff, the 2 Up seat and one of my boys will not weight anywhere close to 500 lbs...again as long as I can mount the 2 Up seat on top of the forward portion of the meshed drop down basket rack.
