949045,Wade,2015-12-13 19:03:00,9,"In response to #26  Hi Brian,  We were bait-fishing shallow water - no more than 10 feet deep -  so we had to make accurate casts and try not to spook them.  I went out three times with him and finally got a 100-pound tarpon on the last day - they are a blast to hook up with - great jumps, long fight.  We lost plenty, too.  I went in April but I think it's better in May and June when they come into the Keys to spawn.  It was definitely worth the money- he really works to get you on fish.

949186,Garry2Rs,2015-12-14 17:21:00,1425,"I have only used braid on my spinning reels for the last 15 years.  The limpness of the braid can lead to problems with the line not sliding onto the pick-up roller and winding around the front of the spool.  I close the bail manually and as I do this, I move the line onto the pick-up roller and draw any slack line off the spool.  This eliminates most problems with loose coils on the reel.  I have read that this also helps to limit line twist, however, I doubt that is true.  Line twist is a built in problem with the design of spinning reels."

944464,SirCranksalot,2015-11-13 02:35:00,3291,To flip or not to flip---that is the question.  While trying to figure out an issue with my reel I ran across this thread from another website that suggests that it's best to flip the bail manually. I don't quite get it-----2 guys in the thread say they recommend it because it reduces line twist. I don't see why flipping manually would be any different from letting the bail spring do it. One guy suggests to do it also to reduce wear on the spring?!? Really? Why save the spring if you don't intend to use it? Nothing like buying a dog and barking yourself!!   Your thoughts? Maybe you see it differently.  http://www.wmi.org/bassfish/bassboard/rods_reels/message.html?message_id=316623

944470,GBW,2015-11-13 03:43:00,8460,I too flip the bail manually to avoid the reel failing at that point in time. I've had reels fail in the past and lost a fish or two so that's why I do it manually
944472,irishfield,2015-11-13 03:44:00,26272,Have never flipped the bail manually after the cast. My C4 I got in '83 still works flawlessly!
944478,manitoubass2,2015-11-13 04:30:00,11391,I do both depending on how im fishing
944489,singingdog,2015-11-13 11:55:00,1047,"Line problems can result from constantly using the bail to stop a lure in midflight: the immediate deceleration causes the line to dig into the spool, causing the dreaded ""loop jump"" that is often confused with line twist. Closing the bail manually is a habit that keeps you from using the bail to stop a lure in mid flight."
944496,hutch4113,2015-11-13 13:15:00,374,"I started flipping manually a few years ago.  I like it more for the control on the cast - distance, etc.  No idea about line twist - I just like it"

944502,Lape0019,2015-11-13 13:38:00,647,"I do it manually as well. I read something on the internet about it a while back and figured what the hell, it can't hurt anything.

944506,AKRISONER,2015-11-13 13:46:00,5558,"I have a stradic that has a wonky bail, it sometimes closes it sometimes doesnt. Prior to using this reel i always used the handle to close the bail, but because of the way the stradic does work and sometimes doesnt, ive conditioned myself to always close the bail manually now...the only downfall i find with it is if you are casting bomb casts with spoons or other sub surface heavier lures and your intent is to rip them hard on the surface i.e. a spoon over surface weeds for pike."
944508,sauce,2015-11-13 13:51:00,219,"I started flipping manually to eliminate ""wind knots"". Don't know what a wind knot is? It usually happens when fishing with braided line on a windy day. You cast, turn handle to close bail and the rotor turns winding line onto the spool. The very first wrap will sometimes end up with a small amount of slack that sticks out to the side of the spool. On your next cast, this slack will sometimes slip off the spool before the line laying on top of it. The end result is a tangle that may require scissors to fix. If you have 150 yards of line on your reel, you can empty it pretty quickly with a couple bad wind knots.  My manual bail flip is almost seamless. When my lure hits the water my right index finger grabs the line and pulls it tight. Left hand taps the bail arm closed and then quickly pulls the line tight as I release index finger and move my rod into retrieval position. Haven't had a wind knot in probably 7 or 8 years. I imagine the other manual flippers here are doing something very similar to what I described."

I do it all the time when making long bomber casts with spoons up on Nipigon for specs.   Although that really doesn't have anything to do with how you close the bail  :)  I feather too but use the tip of my index finger of the hand holding the rod lightly against the forward rim of the spool to slow the line coming off. Helps in heavy winds too to avoid excess belly in the line while casting. Only works when the bail is still open though

944537,captpierre,2015-11-13 17:11:00,2521,I was told the manufacturers recommend a manual flip.
944540,KraTToR,2015-11-13 17:37:00,506,"I do both depending on the situation but I'd say I let the bail close automatically most of the time, especially in a cast then retrieve situation (opposed to letting line out for a drop shot, bottom bounce, float, etc).  If the reel is of decent quality and in good working condition either shouldn't pose a problem.. its what they are designed to do."
944542,manitoubass2,2015-11-13 17:47:00,11391,"I agree. But its also a ""get what ya pay for"" scenario.  Most cheap reels the bail will eventually fail.  On better equipment ive never had an issue.  And i know most here hate okuma spinning reels( seems like it anyhow) but i have 4 okuma avengers that i think i paid 45 bucks per reel and they are workhorses, havent had one fail yet and they have a great drag. These are the reels i abuse the crap outta shorefishing lol"
