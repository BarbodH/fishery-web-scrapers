948808,wormdunker,2015-12-11 15:01:00,1711,"I was browsing Sail yesterday with no intentions of purchasing anything.  Damn Zac (sales rep) showed me the Lowrance Elite 4, on sale reg $400.00 reduced to $300.00!  Best part it comes with Navionics plus.  The navionics plus sells for $230.00, so I got the Elite 4 for 70 bux!  Woo Hoo!"
948813,206,2015-12-11 15:45:00,563,DSI ? I have a Mark4 and it works great for my lil boat. Crappy tire used to have them on sale 279 with hot maps
948825,wormdunker,2015-12-11 18:10:00,1711,"It's the HDI.  I was told it's also compatible for ice fishing.  I presently have a Humminbird 798 in the boat, has side imaging, down scan  & GPS.   My reasoning for the elite 4 is to operate it as a stand alone chart plotter.  I fish Erie a lot for walleye.  I want to see the depths ahead of time as there are many shoals on Erie that come up shallow very quickly.  You'll be trolling in 40 fow then suddenly you're in 14 fow quickly.  Imagine the tangles especially with 4 lines out!"
948831,Cast-Away,2015-12-11 18:53:00,790,It says it only has the US map bud.
948857,Viking,2015-12-11 23:59:00,39,"Tanks for the tip. Got it on my Christma list and wife went it got it. Not allowed to play with it till christmas though. Box says maps for US, Canada, Great Lakes and Alaska?"
948858,wormdunker,2015-12-12 00:02:00,1711,"Zac the sales guy told me it would show maps of Nipissing, the 5 great lakes, Simcoe.  Pretty much what I need.  I respect your statement, but, I hope ur wrong."

948954,wormdunker,2015-12-12 23:24:00,1711,"I haven't had a chance to open it & have a close look.  Can it be used for ice fishing, do I need an ice ducer?  Good to hear others are happy with it."
948965,Rich Nelson,2015-12-13 00:43:00,332,Does it come with a magnifying glass?
