948657,NAW,2015-12-10 14:14:00,4022,I've had that happen to me a few times.!  Kind of makes your hair stand up on the back of your neck!
948661,Sinker,2015-12-10 14:23:00,8692,You don't know how lucky you are to have that ice!!!  Sharpen your spud....mine would be through that in 3 pokes LOL  S.
948665,manitoubass2,2015-12-10 15:19:00,11391,"Lol!!!  Happens to me once a year at least, but on the river the ice drops.  And did I hear at the end ""at least 6"" to avoid divorce""?????"
948668,Tomcat,2015-12-10 15:52:00,395,Thanks for sharing Simon. Funny and informative.
948670,quickme,2015-12-10 16:13:00,261,"thats funny!   Have the happen a few times and you never get use to it.   Man, I can't wait for Simcoe to freeze!!"
948735,misfish,2015-12-10 23:30:00,29133,"LOL Simon.  Wait til your out there and the ice shifts and water comes up your holes. The funniest thing I seen, watching my buddies run out of a perfectly stable hut, not knowing what awaits them outside.LMAO"
948749,manitoubass2,2015-12-11 00:23:00,11391,"On the river, when water levels fluctuate, it would scare the s outta anyone!  Even on 30"" of ice. The ice crackes then drops sometimes as much as 2ft.  No matter how experienced you are you will do a 15 yard dash, laugh and return  Its just instinct"
948778,Moosebunk,2015-12-11 05:46:00,3970,"Didn't know it walking on the ice on the Attawapiskat River the first time in 2000.  Had never iced fish before then, nor gone out on any frozen lake.  Out on the river, see skidoo tracks and everything but walking along an island shore out in the middle the ice just thunders.  Does it again and again. Spooked the heck out of me for my first time. Walked back across to mainland a couple 100 meters carrying basically a dead tree stripped of its branches thinking it might help if I fall through.  Ice had to be 2-3 feet thick that time of year, maybe more.  Didn't come to realize it until sometime later, that the ice was just rising or falling with the tides off James Bay.  Anyways... funny little vid Simon.  Complete with the cuss."
