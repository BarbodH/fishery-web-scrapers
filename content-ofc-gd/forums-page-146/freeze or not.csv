947960,AKRISONER,2015-12-04 17:58:00,5558,"hey its no different than last year folks, and last winter was bloody epic  mild december, but the winter outlook calls for more vortex in February. Id take a hard freeze in Jan Feb, over sketchy snow covered ice that never freezes in december!  We didnt have ice in PAB until the second week of January last year which is unheard of but ended up having the best ice weve ever had!"

I was on the ice the first weekend in December, in Simcoe County on 3.5"" to 5"" solid black ice.   Same spot right now is obviously open water.  A very big difference from last year I would say  This is a very depressing season for early ice crappies."

Nick,  Terry and I were ice fishing on that lake in November, 2 years ago. I still remember reading posts about how we were seen from the hwy from passer bys. LOL"

LOL  You guys posted the 1st OFC ice report of the season, beating me out by a day or less. I remember that.  I am actually fine with this weather. November was a piece of cake, the long term forecast is warm, next weekend 11 degrees here.  I'll get out on the ice later. For now, I'm enjoying not freezing my nuts off."

948055,Freshtrax,2015-12-05 01:50:00,2215,hell or highwater i will be jigging lakers on simcoe jan 1st.....it just may be from a boat
948063,Consigliere,2015-12-05 02:41:00,121,Every year the last few have had the boat docked till Jan in the Larry then back in in April. This year looks good to be able to try to keep it in till Feb then back in in March. Hopefully not out at all. Soft water fishing in the winter is great.
948064,12footspringbok,2015-12-05 03:08:00,459,"Told myself other than maybe a perching or 2 I was going to take this winter off from ice fishing. Sold both my gas augers, and looks like I may have picked the right winter to take a break. Hopefully the fish get a nice break this year too, and we'll both be ready for the ice next winter."
