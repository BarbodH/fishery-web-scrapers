Then when I picked it up thinking, is this what I think it is, of course it was so loud dinging. I had to walk home holding the dinger part so people didn't look at me funny"

948415,Joey,2015-12-08 05:13:00,9122,"Why? Anyone would have just thought you wished Ralphie was a cow is all... Or you didn't want to get busted for taking it eh...   Hahaha, ya, I know all my neighbours, didn't want them asking questions"
948421,Ron,2015-12-08 06:18:00,1683,You just got caught playing with your own ding a ling!
948428,Acountdeleted,2015-12-08 12:50:00,2562,Should have just walked home shouting 'BRING OUT YOUR DEAD!'
948429,wkrp,2015-12-08 12:50:00,656,That thing must have driven more than one cow crazy. Cool find
948431,lew,2015-12-08 13:17:00,12766,"Great find for sure Joey  My dad grew up in Saskatchewan through the '30's and spent all summer, every summer, working on his uncles farm. They had a couple cows and they wore identical bells as yours.  Many many years later Dad went back to Saskatchewan to visit his now retired uncle and was given one of the bells as a gift.  That bell hung in Dad's den for years and after his death I asked Mom if I could have it but it had disappeared and nobody knew where it was.  I'd love to have it today to hang in my own den."

948468,Headhunter,2015-12-08 18:01:00,5703,"Joey, a little time invested in a stick and you could be doing this:  Or perhaps this:  HH"
948485,Cast-Away,2015-12-08 21:49:00,790,"Hey Joey, did any of your neighbours say that your face rings a bell when you walked past them?"
948486,Joey,2015-12-08 21:51:00,9122,"Hey Joey, did any of your neighbours say that your face rings a bell when you walked past them?   Hahahaha, thank goodness no"
948509,SirCranksalot,2015-12-09 00:04:00,3291,"Speaking of cowbells, why did cows wear bells back then but not now? More than a fashion statement I guess??"
948737,Muskieman,2015-12-10 23:36:00,2472,Great find !!
