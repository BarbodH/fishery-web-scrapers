Fish halibut, salmon.  Raise beef cattle. Cut lumber. Metal fabrication. Make anything. Lots of heavy equipment. 3rd generation original from Switzerland. Must be a little weird having a camera crew follow you around."

949005,ketchenany,2015-12-13 15:51:00,3229,Love the woman who is on the trap line with a toddlerstrapped to her back and carrying rifle. I she ever had to shoot that kid would get his eardrums blown out!
949007,JoePa,2015-12-13 16:06:00,179,"Yes - I watch this program and a couple others that have to do with living up in Alaska and living off the land - Live Below Zero - Yukon Men - Alaska Railroad - Gold Rush and others - enjoy them mostly for the scenery - the one thing that gets me with the Last Frontier program is the guys always saying that they won't make it through the winter if they don't get themselves some deer, bear or whatever - heck they got a hundred cows to eat if they had to - I know most of it is made up stuff but it is entertaining to watch -  There is another program called - Buying Alaska - people go around looking for a remote place to live - kinda interesting to see what you get for your money up there - no much that's for sure -"

949062,johnl,2015-12-13 21:59:00,197,Ya Yukon men is my favorite to but most of them are better than most of the other crap on TV.

949179,JoePa,2015-12-14 16:22:00,179,Watched it last night - looks like the one son got himself all banged up - that part wasn't made up - he will probably never be the same again - he is lucky to be alive - walked off a 40 foot cliff in the dark -
949363,Joey,2015-12-15 17:33:00,9122,"My fave is ""Live Free or Die"""
949471,chris.brock,2015-12-16 06:13:00,4053,  There is another program called - Buying Alaska - people go around looking for a remote place to live - kinda interesting to see what you get for your money up there - no much that's for sure -  Anybody else think a lot of those people have no clue what they are in for? The place will be for sale again after the first winter.
949480,pics,2015-12-16 12:41:00,1268,I watched live free or die last night.. the married couple is painful to watch... the guy who built the dugout canoe did a lot of work for a floating brick.. he probably could have traded some firewood for a decent canoe that would last another 20 years... it's all for the show I suppose...
