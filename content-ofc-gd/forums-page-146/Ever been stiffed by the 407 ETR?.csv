Being a very honest guy, he called them a couple of times to point out their error and was told it would be fixed. But it kept happening! They caught up with it eventually before the tax season, otherwise I guess they'd have to issue him a T4!"

Could be that the cameras can't catch my plate number on the truck or trailer. But, I have heard that some Americans have been billed. Lucky you Rich, it's not cheap. Do you have a front plate? I even got a bill one trip just from the trailer plate, a buddy of mine was pulling my boat with his truck, no bill for him but I was charged and paid  I doubt that there would be any consequences for Americans not paying their bills, where we as Canadians can't renew our licence plates if we have unpaid fees. I wonder what kind of kick back our liberals get for that service ? I pay up, don't want to chance being denied entry over a few dollars."
