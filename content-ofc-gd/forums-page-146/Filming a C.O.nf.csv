I'm pretty sure Simon has a GoPro on his head to capture his outdoor adventures.  Thanks Chris, as you say I am filming my outdoor activities like i've done for a decade now…..check out my youtube channel….subscribe……lol…just kidding .  I'm not out for confrontation. I was actually filming as the CO approached as my buddy was reeling in a fish. The CO was actually hiding in the bush watching us….lol…because he witnessed us catch and release a slot fish…which he thanked us for doing. I switched off the camera before he arrived because there is no need to film and it is just out of respect, I know it makes people uneasy, but to be told i'm not allowed to is a whole other matter…especially if it is not the case.  And who the heck is jtracc….""get a life""…..lol…whatever mate…..loving my life thanks all the same."

I film alot and never had an issue. Cops or co's.  As I said many times, dont break the law and dont be a prick.  Cops and COs are just out there doing their jobs. They have families and friends too. They arent out to kill innocent people or in most cases criminals either.  Yeah ya got your bad apples but thats just people in general regardless of their profession/status etc"
949175,JoePa,2015-12-14 15:55:00,179,Filming cops is a big thing down here - if you go on U tube the site is loaded with cops being filmed showing cops acting illegally towards citizens - just google police harassment and see what happens -  the cops don't like it but a citizen has the right to film them - and if the cops isn't doing anything wrong he shouldn't mind it - it is the only protection a citizen has against a bad cop - God only knows how police treated people before the cameras came along -

Some many members I've never met, nor fished with, but I've gotten to know them through their posts, whether its their trades, families, pets, food, pastimes etc.  So yeah we all fish and try to post as many reports as we can. Right now is that time the diehards are out fly fishing or toughing harsh softwater conditions, where many of us wait for the hardwater season to begin. So off topic threads come up more than usual.

949028,limeyangler,2015-12-13 17:47:00,5204,"This has come up a couple of times for me now, given I usually have my GoPro strapped to my head when out hunting or fishing. First time was in the summer when approached by a CO i'm on first name terms with, he asked if I was filming in an abrupt fashion , I told him I wasn't but even if I were it was a free country, I was in a public place and could film whenever I wanted, he changed his tune very quickly. It happened again yesterday out on the ice. The CO approaches, we have the usual pleasant conversation, I don't mind being checked, in fact it is a good thing. He sees the camera on my head and asks if I'm filming, I say no but even if I were I was entitled to do so. He then states that he is pretty sure I'm not allowed to film him, I restate….""oh I'm pretty sure I am""….he then says "" I don't think you are, if you are how come Google has to blank out peoples faces?"" I said that was different, lol…mumbled something about public/private/profit/i'm not a company etc…etc..I was making it up as I went along (i'm stubborn….lol). In the end I informed him I was filming until he came closer as my friend was reeling up a fish as he approached, but as I was a decent person I switched off the camera as he got closer. He said He appreciated it and it all ended amicably enough, but I was pretty mad….don't like being told what to do at the best of times.  I found a whole bunch of stuff online that would indicate I am within my rights to film police officers in Canada…but nothing on COs.  Here is the link to stuff about filming police http://blog.privacylawyer.ca/2012/08/photographing-and-filming-police.html?m=1  Anyhoo, just an interesting afternoon discussion on the ice, and to make it clear I'm not hostile towards COs (unless they are hostile to me) and appreciate the work they do…….lol….however………."

I try to be polite but if people get in my face, they get one or two chances at being nice before I give back same attitude. they can pound sand basically. don't want to be photographed ? stay inside.  one exception is kids. unless I know them, they're off limits."
949047,spincast,2015-12-13 19:49:00,3279,"There is a difference between filming and posting. Nothing to stop you taping what occurs between you two, especially in public. However, posting that on line without the officer's direct permission to do so may well be another matter.  If a legal action were to arise out of the officers visit, pretty sure that video would be accepted into evidence. Different with border guards though. Ya don't want to try that conversation with them."
