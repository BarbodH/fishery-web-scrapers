948850,icefisherman,2015-12-11 22:19:00,952,"OK...used my day off today to play with different options...even went and bought the Pelican 60 from CT to try it...on sale for $60 now but no runners/hitch/cover.... Here is where I am right now...  - Return the 75 to Costco and get my money back....it is simply too heavy too big too cumbersome to try to secure...on top, or in front of the ATV...tried it all...         in front is better option but it sits on top of the ATV dashboard and against the back truck window...it could crush either one. It is also so heavy I have hard time lifting and centering it myself (if no one around to help, as it could happen sometimes I fish or return alone). In the -20 cold when all plastics are brital and I start banging that heavy sled all over the ATV and/or rear window something will give..... Installing cargo carrier on the back of the truck and mounting the 75 to it will likely block my license plate and/or tail lights. It'll also stick on the sides.  - Kind of like Greg's idea with using the same cargo carier but on the ATV instead of the truck and get rid of the sled all together....have to think more about that and see if the space in cargo carrier is enough for all my stuff to fit in.  - And last but maybe best option - I tried fitting the 60 under the ATV....almost but not quite...so with my neighbor we did a bit of experimenting....lifted up the ATV and put two 2x4 joined together under the rear tires....bingo.....plenty of space for the 60 to slide under....then I can fill it in with all my heavy junk and carry it that way. Being under the ATV it'll go nowhere and I can double use that space. What I may do is go buy 4 pieces of 2x10 and join them together...slope the top one under angle so ATV can easily drive on top...cheap easy solution...the lift will not be that much so it should still be safe to transport the ATV on the HWY and the tail gate will remain close. By the time I equip the 60 with runners/hitch/cover it'll end up about same price ($140) as the 75 package was. Did put all my ice fishing gear in the 60...here is what it looks like...obviously loaded more than the 75 but doable space wise.      Now if I can use the cargo carrier on the ATV as per Greg's idea and it fits all my ice fishing gear from the pictures above maybe better on the long run to return both sleds and purchase the cargo carrier. It'll end up cheaper that way...just not sure of the usable space in it....Greg may PM you my friend.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
948856,FishAbout,2015-12-11 23:56:00,106,If you don't have to pull anything behind you are better off. The smaller narrow sleighs tend to flip on there sides.  The cargo rack is a better idea but would need to rig up some kind of mud flap to stop snow and slush from covering your stuff. You will be able to travel faster down the lake also. If you get in deep snow and slush the sleigh can bog you down faster.
948872,Joeytier,2015-12-12 02:34:00,3990,Be careful pulling the 60 behind the 4wheeler.  They are made of much thinner plastic than the 75.  At the very least put runners on it like the 75's have.  I cracked the crap outta my 60 in one season pulling it behind the sled
948721,icefisherman,2015-12-10 22:54:00,952,"Trying to get ready for the ice season I went and bought the Pelican 75 complete package (sled, towing hitch, cover) from Costco...what a BEAST that thing is...got it home...tried different ways with my ATV on the back of the truck (F150 SuperCrew cab with 6.5' bed)...no way to fit it, no how...not in the cab...not to the side or under the atv....will likely return it. Unless someone wants to trade me for one that fits in my truck bed....  Maybe someone can recommend different slimmer sled that can still be towed by ATV with solid towing hitch?  Wondering if the smaller Pelican 60 series will fit either under or on the side of the bike? If so where can I get a good deal on one? The deal on the 75 at Costco was fantastic but not much good to me if I cannot transport it to the lake.... Anyhow...looking for ideas and comments.... ATV fits nicely and I am able to close the tail gate. No one could believe it....loading the biggest Grizzly in the bed and closing the gate on it!! Want to keep it that way. So No I don't want to open it and somehow carry the sled on the tail gate....and I don't want to buy a trailer...with two boats and an ATV in my garage no room for another trailer...so got to get creative somehow.,...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
948722,MistyHollow,2015-12-10 22:57:00,21,what about a roof rack on the truck and put the sled up top?  Dan
948727,porkpie,2015-12-10 23:15:00,2521,"When I'm using the atv, I try to keep everything on the racks.  A Jet sled junior goes across my back rack, and everything goes inside it.  The auger and my pop up hut goes on the front rack.  If there isn't much snow, I'll sometimes pull a fishtrap guide, and this just fits beside my bike in the back of the truck if I push the bike over and use a couple ratchet straps.  I haven't found a sled that fit under my bike yet, beside yes but not under. At least not one designed for hauling a lot of gear."
948729,bare foot wader,2015-12-10 23:18:00,1354,"is there not room to turn the sled sideways and wedge it between atv and the bed rail? it'll stick up on the tailgate and need to strap it down but it works just fine....I used to have that same pelican sled I think you're talking about...it measures about 5 or 6"" longer than the box right? or I'd strap it to one of the quad racks even, it would only stick out a foot or so on each side"
948732,icefisherman,2015-12-10 23:26:00,952,"Can't fit on the side...sled is too high/deep...not enough room on the side even if I lift and move by hand the atv to the left or right....as I said this sled is MONSTER....never seen anything so big.... Should have said I need to carry Clam cube hut, power auger, Big Buddy heater, propane bottles, tackle, bucket to seat/fill up with whities, chairs, etc.....both my kids when they come with me (one in front of me on my seat, the other behind me on a 2 UP seat - separate post about that is coming ;-). So my rear rack will be taken by the 2 UP seat....and front one will not be enough to carry everything...hence need a sled...hmmmm...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

I have a reese hitch on my quad and if I'm travelling light I just put my cargo rack on the back of the bike and forget the sled.  You can carry all kinds of gear even with the 2-up seat on it.  If I still want to tow the sled or the tow-behind clam, I made a little hitch on the back of the cargo rack and tow it behind too.  You do need to make sure your exhaust is not blowing on your stuff though or things get melted....don't ask how I know.  The cargo rack comes off easy when you load the atv in the truck and takes up hardly any space at all.  "

We invested in a adjustable receiver extension to move the carrier closer to the ground so it wouldn't interfere with the tailgate even when loaded.

Wish I had pics to show you but I'm sure you know get the idea.  The cargo carrier is well below the tailgate once the sled is off it so it doesn't even come close to being in the way while loading the ATV into the back of the truck via ramps.  These hitch mounted cargo carriers are a gods send IMHO. I have move a LOT of extra stuff with them, mostly for my sons when they went to college, move out of college and move into a new house then again when they move to another house.

The second one that folds up looks just like mine but mine does not fold up. I really like the aluminum for lightness and non-corrosive reasons.
