948848,Bondar,2015-12-11 22:16:00,817,I will be attempting to change the upper crank shaft seal tomorrow on my 1999 Mercury 50hp 4 stroke. Anything I should look out for? Seems fairly straight forward. Just looking for someone who may have done this before Thanks

948951,hirk,2015-12-12 22:43:00,571,Before you touch it find a service manual online. I can tell you merc 2.5 litre blocks require you to split the block halves and possibly pull the pistons/rods for that repair.
