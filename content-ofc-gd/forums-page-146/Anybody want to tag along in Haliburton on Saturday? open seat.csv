949132,chris.brock,2015-12-14 02:32:00,4053,".........and??? Film at 11?  You should have come out.  I had a great day and can still say, I haven't met an OFCer I didn't get along with.  Kewley has the pics, he may put something together."
948516,chris.brock,2015-12-09 01:36:00,4053,"Chris Coolio and I are fishing likely brookies, if not, splake Saturday, Minden area.  We thought it could be fun to see if any OFC'ers want to tag along.  You would need your own boat and to be able to portage it and be ok with wearing a blindfold at times during the drive in."
948518,Gallie,2015-12-09 01:49:00,1215,"Although all of that sounds rather intriguing im busy this weekend, i would love to do a day of fishin with you at some point though! Good luck bud!"
948531,misfish,2015-12-09 11:51:00,29133,Dragging a boat is out of the question for me.  Can I swim and fish from shore? LOL
948534,Meegs,2015-12-09 12:58:00,249,If I wasn't in Florida till sat I'd be all over it.  The 12 foot tinners sitting there already to go
948536,Sinker,2015-12-09 13:11:00,8692,I need to find me a smaller tinner!!  S.
948540,chris.brock,2015-12-09 13:53:00,4053,If I wasn't in Florida till sat I'd be all over it. The 12 foot tinners sitting there already to go  Florida is a good place to be this time of year.  Tinners won't work. I was meaning a canoe or kayak that can be carried. I don't think your toon is an option Bri. Float tube would work.
948543,NAW,2015-12-09 14:25:00,4022,"Man, I would love to join, but I am going to be getting tanked any my company Christmas party!! That being said, I have lots of time off between now and Jan 11th!   So PM me if your looking for a fishing partner."
948545,mistaredone,2015-12-09 14:30:00,913,I've wanted to get into this type/style of fishing for a few years now. If December wasn't so busy I'd go buy a canoe.
948549,msp,2015-12-09 15:30:00,1336,Hmmm...... being led into the bush blindfolded with strangers. No thanks.
948550,AKRISONER,2015-12-09 15:51:00,5558,"Hmmm...... being led into the bush blindfolded with strangers. No thanks.  loll this is what I thought, hey guys make sure you bring all of your expensive fishing gear and at least $200 cash as well ahaha  I think (hope) chris is joking about the blindfold? internet is not so good for determining tone"
948551,NAW,2015-12-09 15:55:00,4022,"Oh, I'm sure he's quite serious.  As he should be.  I would also add, a strip search for a GPS unit before heading out."
948553,chris.brock,2015-12-09 16:15:00,4053,as well as signing a lengthy non disclosure agreement.
948554,grimsbylander,2015-12-09 16:26:00,3016,I heard they're filming Deliverance 2 up north this weekend...
948557,Acountdeleted,2015-12-09 16:47:00,2562,"Dang, this has my name all over it except Saturday is no good. Please keep me in mind in the future."
948563,chris.brock,2015-12-09 17:49:00,4053,"Dang, this has my name all over it except Saturday is no good. Please keep me in mind in the future.  yep, was totally thinking you might swing this  will do,"

948583,John Bacon,2015-12-09 21:15:00,3277, Florida is a good place to be this time of year.  Tinners won't work. I was meaning a canoe or kayak that can be carried. I don't think your toon is an option Bri. Float tube would work.  Is this the first time that you've been told that you can't come because your boat is too big?
948599,SirCranksalot,2015-12-09 22:32:00,3291,"I'll try to get a permission slip to go!   Have canoe, will carry!"
948602,mukluk,2015-12-09 22:42:00,196,"Believe ""brookies are closed as of Sept. 30 in Minden area.   Open for business Jan. 1 2016.            Splake is open all year."
948606,chris.brock,2015-12-09 23:02:00,4053,We are Freemen of the Land and don't abide by seasons and limits and such.
948616,ckewley,2015-12-10 00:55:00,699,"We are Freemen of the Land and don't abide by seasons and limits and such. Lmao, awesome!!!!"
948646,Meegs,2015-12-10 11:42:00,249,The canoe is beside the tinner... so that would be an easy swap... Florida is alright but I'd way rather be speck fishing!!!
948648,Meegs,2015-12-10 12:05:00,249,
948658,AKRISONER,2015-12-10 14:15:00,5558,ive got $10 bucks that the lake is actually in smiths falls and chris is just trying to get rid of the tale on the weekend.
