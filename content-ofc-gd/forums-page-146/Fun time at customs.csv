949506,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-16 16:20:00,10439,"Guess it depends on the border too  The international falls border is rediculous.  Google image it from above its a big american flag, even has one of those big xray type machines  Looks more like a small army base than customs  I've crossed at couple of real redneck border crossings. Portal North Dakota is a good one. Poorly laid out and you really have no idea where you're going. You drive around a few buildings until you find a little gatehouse where the agent is. Poker Creek Alaska is a great little border crossing. There is a sign there that says POP. 2!!! One US guard and one Canadian. It's also the most Northerly border crossing in North America. When you go into the US they ask you if you would like your passport stamped. The stamp is quite big (about the size of a business card) and has a large image of a caribou and Poker Creek Alaska in it.  The crossing @ Beaver Creek Yukon is more like a traditional crossing. The guards there on both sides are really good people. On year when I was pulling my camper to Alaska I had a rock kicked up by my tire bounce off the front of the trailer and smash my rear window about 5 miles from the US border. When I got to the border I asked the guard if they had any plastic and tape for the window I just broke. They hooked me up with garbage bags and tape as well as a garbage bin and broom to clean up. Didn't really ask me any questions other than where I was going, doing and how long."

949514,Walleye72,2015-12-16 16:54:00,156,"Okay, border stories.  I have one.   Now this is from 1992, so obviously things have changed a good deal in the 20 + years since this happened.  My good friend and I drove to Halifax, NS in April after finishing our first year of university.  I have a large extended family out there and he had never been so an inexpensive way to visit the East Coast.  We decided to drive through the USA to save some money on gas and also because he wanted to see Lake Placid.  We get to the border at Calais, USA /  St. Stephen. NB.  We pull up at about 4 in the morning and there is nobody around.  Like deadsville!!  If it happened like this today you'd think you were in a zombie movie or something. but I swear there was no one anywhere.  What do we do?  Do we just go through.  No I'm pretty sure we can't do that.  Okay we get out to investigate. Now this border crossing is no Windsor/Detroit or Peace Bridge but it's not tiny either.   There's this big building on the left with huge 10 foot tall windows going all across the length of the building.(A glass wall is what I'm trying to say. )  Oh there's the door.  Let's go in.  It's locked.  You have to be freaking kidding me.  Now remember, we're both just 20 years old and this is our first major road trip by ourselves.  Anyways finally I bang on the window with my fists to make some noise.  The place is way too big to knock.  Finally a uniformed person comes out from behind somewhere and come's over to the door.  Hi, where ya headed.  Halifax.  Okay, drive safe.  I'm totally not exaggerating, that was it.  We got back into the Chevette and drove on."
949515,lew,2015-12-16 17:20:00,12766,"We were fishing for muskies on the Upper Niagara at Fort Erie on the last day of the season a few years back. After we were done for the day I headed along the QEW and for whatever reason...still haven't figured out why...but ended up on the road to the Peace Bridge and the USofA and sure didn't want to go there. Just before the bridge I made an illegal left turn and came back to Canada Customs. He asked how long I'd been in the States and I then explained how I actually never left Canada. He said ""your not allowed to make a left turn there"" and I said ""yeah I know that but thought you'll be easier to deal with then US customs seeing as I don't have a passport"".  He gave me a goofy look and sorta laughed and said it was just crazy enough to believe but said I had to go to secondary to be checked.  Three guards came out and took my truck apart and kept asking about my fishing gear even though I told them the same story. Eventually they turned me loose and told to drive through the gate and pay $3.  Never left my country but still had to cough up $3 to get back in"

I used to cross freely on my bike to work with just a nod and a wave.  The same folks I had grown to know over the years drew guns on me after 9/11 for the exact same thing they had given me permission to do!  I was detained all day. Although i an an american citizen and its my RIGHT to pass the boarder.  They had cops escort me to the I falls courthouse to obtain my birth certificate records(i never used to carry it)  After proving my citizenship to guys that already knew I was american, they continued to detain me.  After 12 or so hours I was denied access(illegally) to enter my own country.  After filling out many forms, I was sent to canadian customs with the police waiting.  More forms, and questions. I knew these guys well and they were shocked.  But the paperwork had to be done so I did it.  I have not crossed the border since. It left me with a very bad taste in my mouth so to speak."

949491,Headhunter,2015-12-16 15:22:00,5703,"It was a number of years ago that a buddy of mine was getting married. His best man planned a trip to Niagara Falls New York for the 30 odd guys attending the stag. We were all there when the ""groom"" arrived at the bar with the best man. It took about ten of us to hold him down, so the best man could attach the bowling ball and chain to his leg. We then boarded a chartered bus, that was to take us to the falls that evening. There were a number of consumables on the bus, cases of beer stacked in the aisle. Needless to say, by the time we arrived at the border, most if not all of us would have no problem admitting that we were likely over served by that point. The best man told us to behave as he was going to exit the bus to talk to the U.S. border agents. After a few minutes, four border agents got on the bus, asking to see the ball and chain. Laughs were exchanged and they sent us on our way. I know things have changed since that time, but I thought it was a funny story to pass along. HH"

949364,mike rousseau,2015-12-15 17:38:00,4661,Sooooo....  I'm pretty anal about declaring everything I purchase in the good ol US of A and drive back through Canadian customs... I used try hide a few lures here and there but the stress wasn't worth the few $$ in taxes I was dodging...  So today I went to pick up a package of jigging raps cause all the local shops don't carry the size and color I wanted...  My dad asked me (by text) to pick up a package for him but I refused cause he didn't have documentation for the merchandise (like I said im anal about this stuff...) in the end he texted me saying nevermind they are illigal in Canada... (That part of the story in very important)  So I got to customs and the guy was extra thorough today... He asked why I was in USA... I explained I got a package of lures for $56...  I had my fishing gear in the truck like every other time I've crossed the border... He asked where it came from... I replied asking him if he wanted a specific breakdown of each item and also informed him I could prove the date of purchase on most of the equipment through my cabelas account...  He then asked about my 5gal gas tank in the back... I said it was full before I went over and I hadn't purchased gas while in the USA... It's so I'm never stranded.... He didn't believe me...  Soooo...  I get pulled in for a vehicle search... They check my phone and see the text from my dad (told you it was important) about the package of illigal flea collars... They asked about it and I replied that as the texts show I refused to pick up the package...  So they call the shipping/receiving store I send my packages to and they say I picked up 2 PACKAGES!!!! When I only picked up 1...  That's when things got a little interesting... The customs officers informed me the store said I picked up 2 packages and then they got more aggressive with me threatening to detain me all day... I simply replied that as long as I could call work I'll stay all day till we sort this out.... (I'm assuming that threat work on people smuggling merchandise?)  At this point we take things inside where I undergo a minor strip search/pat down and more questioning... I had them call the store back cause I knew that I picked up a package a week earlier and there was also my dad's package with the same last name still at the store... So maybe they made a mistake...  Sure enough the 2nd mystery package was the one I picked up and declared at customs Dec 5th... They confirmed my dad's package (illigal dog collars) was still at the shop and not in my keister... Wich was great for my keister's sake...  They let me go on my way after that...  I was a little surprised that they didn't apologize after finding out the store who supplies intel for them gave them the wrong information causing me to be detained longer and searched... The rest of the ordeal I'm ok with... They were being thurough but that mistake could have been really bad for me... They could have torn apart my vehicle based on bad info...  Anyways jigging raps are in my ice box and I have an interesting story to talk about tonight... Lol
