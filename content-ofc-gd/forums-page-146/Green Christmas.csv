949166,porkpie,2015-12-14 14:46:00,2521,I'm okay with it!
949168,irishfield,2015-12-14 15:07:00,26272,"I had a RUSH order come in yesterday for a set of hydraulic wheel skis... with some really weird size and rigging requirements on the supplied drawings. Thought it was one of those scams, as they paid in advance and are sending the military to pick them up! They must be done by this Friday so that they have a week to do the install. Maybe they'll take me with them to make sure everything works..."
949176,leaf4,2015-12-14 16:17:00,2466,My neighbor is a teacher in Taiwan and purchased me a new snowblower so long as I keep his sidewalk and side drive clear while he's away... Ok deal
949178,OhioFisherman,2015-12-14 16:19:00,6623,"It's 65 degrees here now, if it wasn't for the wind and rain it would probably be a good day to hit Lake Erie for some smalies or walleye, perhaps a steelhead or two."
949180,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-14 16:31:00,2582,Just went and dumped wood ashes from the woodstove on my veggie garden. It is so warm and dry I almost fired up my tiller to work them in. Never had a chance to do  that in December before. While out there I noticed yellow dandelions in my yard and my clematis vines are budding which probably isn't a good thing for them.  I'm getting real itchy for some ice fishing but I'm not minding no snow to shovel.

949212,Joeytier,2015-12-14 21:13:00,3990,"This has got to be the first time I've seen every lake wide open this late into the year.  Colder temps starting tomorrow, but still well above seasonal, I think we've had two days that reached -10 or colder so far this year, both were probably 2 weeks ago...ground is soft, unbelievable.  I doubt we'll have a green christmas but it's entirely possible at this point.  It will be interesting to see what the opener on Nipissing is like.  Wouldn't surprise me if operators aren't able to get their huts out."

Might give it a shot this year if I can pick some worms.  Thx for posting that.  I only switched to roe when steelheading in the fall when I couldn't get nightcrawlers anymore, often a first drift on a hole produced on pressured fish that had seen a steady progression of spawn sacks all day."
