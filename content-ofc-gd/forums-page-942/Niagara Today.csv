266777,jwl,2008-11-12 20:55:00,1056,"Hit the  Lower Niagara today with a couple fellow winter diehards out in my boat for a crack at some steel.   Fishing was slow to say the least, no good reports from anyone out there, we did a bunch of travelling around to try to find some fish and some good drifts.  The current was a bit goofy today and some spots had barely a drift in the boat,viz not the greatest either but water still green.  We tried everything...yarnflies,roe, and streamers and only came up with 2 for our efforts.   I was getting a bit worried as I have this ongoing joke that my boat has never seen a skunk day since it rolled off the lot in summer of 2003, but somehow we manage to avoid the black and white stinky every time. I don't even care if it's me who puts one in the bott as long as at least one comes in it.  Finally my buddy Niagara put a little steelie in the boat saving the day, quickly after I commented and commended him for keeping the streak going..pheww!!!  We fished it hard, didn't see any other boats in the spots we tried hook up on anything, I still think it's just too nice out...water has finally dipped into the high 40's but it's still a bit to warm for any big numbers.  After spending the morning out there and getting ready to go home, I managed one OOSer greaser for the day, too bad it's not December yet or else I could have added a few nice inches for the Slammers on that one...but hey, I am getting the boat out there and trying guys, I will get one any day now!!!!  Quick CPR and off she went back into the drink   "
