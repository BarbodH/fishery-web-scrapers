266613,jdmls,2008-11-12 02:44:00,575,"  Couldn't agree more...That's 3 systems this year that I have learned about hidden pools in the lower sections. Lower sections are bigger water and can be intimidating at first sight, but walk them when the water is low and you will be able to point out the deeper sections for when the water levels raise.... Then most of the time you will have them to your self, as others crowd the more popular easy sections up river, when conditions are prime."
266616,kemper,2008-11-12 02:48:00,2232," A couple of those pools looked real nice eh?  That one with the logjam in the back has produced big numbers for me in the past, looked pretty good when we went, I still cant figure out why nothing was hangin out in there..."
266622,jdmls,2008-11-12 03:02:00,575,"  Ya they were real nice !! The logjam looked like a prime holding zone and had good depth. Other than the HOBO and that DOE ,  nobody else will be down there come prime water, LOL .... Rain baby Rain !!!!!"

266876,Clampet,2008-11-13 00:54:00,1947," By George, I think you've got it!"
266287,kemper,2008-11-10 23:50:00,2232,"  I KNEW I didnt make that up!  Has worked well for me in the past, water level is usually a little higher down at the bottom and changes with the lake. Dave (JDMLS) and I tried that out this weekend and were not rewarded but it definatly has been a trend I have noticed.  good info Mike"
