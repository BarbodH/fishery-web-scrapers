266591,huntervasili,2008-11-12 02:03:00,1604,"Yup, buck has had a couple of really nice knives put out for collectors. It would make something neat to display no doubt, too bad I don't have 700$ USD burning a hole in my pocket. Thanks for sharing GCD, had yet to see this one"
266606,glen,2008-11-12 02:22:00,2641,It hard to tell from a pic but the guard on the handle turns me off.  It looks too big on a knife with a blade of that size.

266686,Greencoachdog,2008-11-12 13:34:00,8163,"It's an old WW1 ""Doughboy"" trench warfare knife, military issue."

266835,holdfast,2008-11-12 23:51:00,1813,"I kind of thought it was a Bayonet, but the knuckle Rings and the lack of Barrel clips, tells me its a Pre Rambo knife.  Was it ever GI issued?"
266856,Clampet,2008-11-13 00:30:00,1947,"Now ...that's a knife (knives)! Wonder why they call some of them neckers? And, why they are so wide at the blade?"
