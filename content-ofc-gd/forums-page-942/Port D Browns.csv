265926,Streamerguy,2008-11-09 22:09:00,121,"Saturday morning I was on my way down to the whirlpool to do some fishing when I noticed these ladies 20 ft away from the rope we use to get down there....     after getting a little closer i noticed 3 more down the hill side of the gorge,amazing!!!  I pulled up to the parking lot and it was ""FULL"" way to many ppl down there,so i'm off to Port D for some browns and bows!!! I caught 5 and lost 5   (no fish= no pics)  Today i decided to get there early to beat the crowd,but i guess everyone else was thinking the same thing!!Got there @ 6am to find it pretty much packed.It's pitch dark out and these guys are out there fishing with glow corkies for crying out loud.  I finally got a spot by the ""hole"" and started the day of really slow but the guy 5 ft away from me was on fire  .I made a few corrections and then I landed my first female of the day    Ya that's the guy behind me  lol  20 min after I landed this male    40 min later I landed another male and tried the Solo Style picture taking but the fish didn't co-operate    and only 7 min later I landed this little beauty    That was pretty much my weekend,enjoy the soft porn!!

265999,Mike the Pike,2008-11-10 00:12:00,3421,Wow can't believe the wall to wall fisherman .I love the shot of the trout turning.  
266000,Radnine,2008-11-10 00:17:00,1538,It looks like that one fish reared back and bent your smoke!
266001,solopaddler,2008-11-10 00:19:00,8605,Nice fish bud! How the heck did you manage to get that spot on a weekend? LOL! I've yet to fish it even on weekdays...always shoulder to shoulder.
266018,jwl,2008-11-10 00:58:00,1056,"good going on the fish, it's loading up in there for sure...was there in my boat on Friday morning for a go, we got 1 bow and one  male brown that was about 15lbs ole beater looking one that got all excited all over my buddy's shirt.....ummm...got milt ?  Looks like Saturday was a slow day, Friday I counted 36 people fishing in that spot alone   ..let alone the other 20 or so people spread out on both sides..was nice to be floating in the boat away from the crowds...4 boats out including mine, and we knew all the people in 2 of the other boats so it was cool....slow day in the boats though the current was totally goofed up and or non-exsistant.  looks like you hit a lucky spot and lucked out a bit on the crowds, I hate fishing there from shore"
266225,Marko,2008-11-10 19:13:00,854,Those are beatifull fish man!! Dont you hate when a guy beside you catches a fish every cast and you have to struggle to land a few
266249,misfish,2008-11-10 21:27:00,29133,Thanks for the hunting report.LOL  Nice fish bud. The building in the back ground sure brings back some old memories. Getting there before anyone else and trying to hold yer spot even after having to walk the wall to retrieve yer fish.
266251,johnnyb,2008-11-10 21:35:00,3413,"Nicely done, man!  No bottom bouncing required, eh?"
266306,Streamerguy,2008-11-11 00:42:00,121," Can you imagine trying to fish at night with that many lines being tossed in the water?No thanx.I have to be able to see my line and see where it's going/not going. There all nuts i tell ya...lol    I have gotten to know some of the local's or should i say loco's down there ,always a few kind words,bring a net and if you really want it bad enough? Always bring 2 Lg Timmies 1 black with cream and sugar in a bag ...  Just ask Mike,95% of the time they'll say sure,hope to see ya down there sometime.  I got a chance today to toss the line for 2 hrs in this crazy wind and cold today,got this male and tried my ""SoloStyle"" picture taking   Just looks so natural      Not after he gave me some brown roe...  naw j/k I get just as much a thrill if I catch it or the guy next to me does.  thanx for the comments everyone  Streamerguy "
266310,jwl,2008-11-11 00:51:00,1056,"hey good to see ya hittin em up again today, nice looking colours on that one, you sound like me, even if I am out in my boat I don't really care if I am the one catching them, or anyone else in the boat is hammering them, it's all fun to me, I don't mind being the net man once in a while as long as it keeps the 5 1/2 year never seen a skunk ever streak going in my boat, I may get skunked but as long as the carpet sees some slime it's all good...have to sell it if the unthinkable happens  besides even when you are fishing from the banks, the guy beside you is getting them and not you...if ya offer to net it, or just go check it out after landed, you get a good chance to see what they are using  river is starting to put out"
266498,Streamerguy,2008-11-11 22:36:00,121," That doesn't sound to good Jack,hope you get to keep her.  There's always shoreline fishing!!!   Streamerguy "
