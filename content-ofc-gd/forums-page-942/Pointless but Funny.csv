Somebody put a poster on the toilet in the staff bathroom that said ""IF YOU PEE ON THE SEAT, KARMA WILL GET YOU""  Well last night the night crew put a lifesize halloween mannequin behind the bathroom door with a sign around his neck that said KARMA  Man, it gave everyone a heart attack that used that bathroom.. myself included! LOL  Ahh... I need to fish."
