266750,luv2drift,2008-11-12 19:15:00,147,A question for the canoers.  I have a kevlar canoe and I have a small hole above the water line on the keel stern from wacking it off the ground on a steep portage. What's the best way to repair it.  The hole is the size of a nickle and is not through the entire hull. It is more like a deep chip. What should I do?

Our Outdoor Recreation dept. at my local university put them on ALL of their plastic/kevlar/fibreglass/etc. canoes. But they do cost money. The technician told me(at the time, which was 15 yrs. ago) they were paying $60.00 each for them. What they cost now I do not know."
