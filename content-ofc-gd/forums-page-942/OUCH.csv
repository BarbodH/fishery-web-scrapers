266825,Bernie,2008-11-12 23:17:00,3190,It looks like it will create a little bit more downforce on the back end. Adjust the left front trackbar and put in a little wedge.
266837,danc,2008-11-12 23:56:00,4677, Half a pound of air out of the right front would help too Bernie.
266840,irishfield,2008-11-12 23:57:00,26272,What ever you did to it Brian... reverse path and match the other side... otherwise it's gonna wanna pull for the guard rail when you head up the 400 extension.

267196,tjsa,2008-11-13 22:58:00,1578,"That's too bad Brian, seems like you are one of the guys that likes to keep impeccable care of your vehicles and equipment.  I am the reverse,    I beat the living crap out of it, fix it, and don't look back.  What actually did happen though??    I caved in the drivers side of my pickup box right behind the gas fill-up tube one time. One foot further to the right and all would have been good. My bud mentioned it to one of the CO's where it happened, and he said ""he drove in............................there??????????""  Hee, hee, hee, I am hard on equipment."
