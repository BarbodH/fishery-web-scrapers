I took her at 25 yards with a slug from a 12 guage. She went about 15 feet.  About a half hour later i saw a small 6 point but he never presented a shot.     Saturday another guy dusted a spike with descent body size, and about 2 hours after my doe sunday, another fellow took a doe at about 10 feet. She almost ran him over at his watch with a hound right on her tail. The rest of the group is hunting until saturday this week and there is already 3 hanging. SHould a be a good week for them.  It was a pretty nice weekend to be out.    -R-"

266862,oxcowboy,2008-11-13 00:41:00,544,"congrats on getting your first, now your bank account is in real trouble, cause you always want more things to hunt with, fishermen/hunter is kinda like a smoker taking up chewing.   good job,  jason"
