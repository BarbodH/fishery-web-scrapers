266709,limeyangler,2008-11-12 15:49:00,5204,"sorry steel,  i klnow very little about motors.....but just wanted tyo say that they look really cool!"
266711,jediangler,2008-11-12 15:50:00,1923,"Wow, that certainly is an old one. I thought my 74 Johnson 2hp was a relic. I'm sure someone will have some help for you. ."
266729,Bernie,2008-11-12 17:37:00,3190,That does look like a Johnson. Not sure what year. Dad is away hunting this week but can ask him when he returns about what year it was made.
266733,outdoorguy61,2008-11-12 17:56:00,220,"If you go to the Toronto Boat Show, there will be a collectors club that will have members interested in motors and classic boats. My own knowledge is marginal in this particular area.  outdoorguy61"
266803,Bernie,2008-11-12 22:08:00,3190,oops
266804,Bernie,2008-11-12 22:09:00,3190,I asked the guys here to have a look. I got shot down. Not a Johnson. Consensus among them is that it most likely is an Elto. The first pic the guys figure is an old British Seagull used for sailboaters.
266850,Glaucus,2008-11-13 00:21:00,48,The motor in the last picture looks like a 3.6hp Scott-Atwater 1-12.
266853,PERCHER,2008-11-13 00:28:00,787,I dont know what it is but I had one about 10 years ago.I think it is a 3 1/2 h.p.Maybe an old Scott. Dan

267252,steelhunter,2008-11-14 00:51:00,81,still looking for info in these motors
267359,boatman,2008-11-14 12:34:00,350,"These motors are out of my area of expertise, but just juding by the photos I'd guess the first is an Elto Ace and the second an Elto 3-5hp. If you posted on AOMCI and they said the first was a British Seagull then I'd take their word over mine. If it is, the serial and model number should be at the base of the motor. Both should have serial and model numbers. The second motor should have it on or around its transom bracket. You need some better photos of both motors. Front, sides, top, rear and lower unit. Take some close ups of the powerheads. You can email me the photos and I can try to help you out. If you can narrow down the models I can get you whatever info you need.  I forgot to add a line about value. Unfortunately, they don't have any significant monetary value. Price is completely subjective. What I see comparable motors sell for on the collector market and in the Buy/Sell maybe less than what one individual will pay. Someone is always willing to pay more. You just have to find that one person. The first motor may bring as much as $60. You'd be hard pressed to get more than $40 for the second one in its present state. Running and painted maybe $100 if you're lucky. I should also add that those are top prices. There is a market for Elto Ace's and British Seagulls, however, even restored these motors are only worth $200-300. More if its a rare model."
267426,boatman,2008-11-14 17:14:00,350,"On second thought, the last motor is a late 1940's early 1950's Scott-Atwater 3-5 hp. The colour threw me. I can't see it in your photos, but there should be a throttle lever above the carburetor that moves side to side. Sorry, I should have looked closer the first time.  Email me with any questions you may have."
