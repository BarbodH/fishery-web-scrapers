266718,Headhunter,2008-11-12 16:18:00,5703,"Hey folks, Just wondering if anyone who is coming from west of Quinte could tell me the best way to get to Perfect Vue. I know where it is, but I am wondering if I should take the 401 all the way to Napanee or should I take my usual route through Prince Edward County, to Picton, then the Glenora Ferry? Thanks folks! HH"
266722,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-12 16:55:00,1362,I would go the Napanee route...it's a lot quicker...exit 579 off the 401
266723,PERCHER,2008-11-12 17:08:00,787,I get off at Marysville RD and stop at the Indian store for tax free stuff then turn left at the lights into Napanee.

Lotsa Luck on the weekend, could be cool and windy"
