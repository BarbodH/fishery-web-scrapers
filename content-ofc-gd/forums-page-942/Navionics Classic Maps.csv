266808,Raf,2008-11-12 22:30:00,3495,"Have an older gps/sonar that apparently is only compatible with Classic maps, not gold, platinum or hotmaps.  I've seen the gold on a unit and it looks great, I am wondering how the classic maps compare? level of detail? I've been unable to find any screen caps on the 'net.  Can anyone offer insight?"
266842,cram,2008-11-13 00:03:00,1733,Raf -- You just brought up a topic i was going to ask about.  How do i found out what lakes are covered?  The ones i generally fish aren't exactly mainstream lakes......
266845,Roy,2008-11-13 00:08:00,13728,Which model do you have Raf?
266849,Raf,2008-11-13 00:18:00,3495,"this will be for an lcx-15mt.  cram, navionics.com has coverage areas for the different mapping lines.  first you need to find out which mapping line your unit will accept.  i'm guessing if it's newer it will take the gold & platinum lines"
