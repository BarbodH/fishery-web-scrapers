266763,anders,2008-11-12 20:07:00,1168,Its only a matter of time before one of the best GM's in hockey will be in Toronto..
266764,SlowPoke,2008-11-12 20:09:00,2984,"I hope you're right - it'll be a gong show! If the team still sucks, media relations will be a gas!"
266773,misfish,2008-11-12 20:37:00,29133, I think yer giving the boys less credit then they deserve there . They are doing just fine for a young team.The kids have spark.
266776,canadianboy,2008-11-12 20:52:00,83,im a leafs fan only when they win and i think thast brian burke is a terrible gm the team that won in anaheim wasnt even his it was more so the prevoius gms he just came in at a good time you want a good gm look at darryl sutter
266778,misfish,2008-11-12 20:56:00,29133, I can see that. Nice call CB.
266779,Stoty,2008-11-12 20:56:00,2910,"See what happens when you get rid of all the ""prissy"" players and have young, HARD working players who have to play that way to stay in the league!  None of this ""ya..i might try tonight"" attitude. These guys HAVE to play each shift like its their last just to say in the league. Just goes to show you how hard work pays off, even if your not the most talented team in the league.  Adding Burke would be the smartest move they could do.....there are a lot of great UFA's out there that will be moved (Mr. Kovalchuk for example) and he is the guy to make those moves!  If they make a couple moves and bring some highly-skilled guys in..... they might actually have a shot at the *gasp* playoffs."
266780,Stoty,2008-11-12 20:57:00,2910, Nuff said!
266827,JohnF,2008-11-12 23:21:00,3494,"Burke always seems to have a serious chip on his shoulder, or perhaps he's just trying to live up to his hardassed rep. And Toronto seems to be onto something right now. Perhaps a hardass behind the bench is enuf, and one more might just lead to an implosion from internal friction. Who knows?  JF"
