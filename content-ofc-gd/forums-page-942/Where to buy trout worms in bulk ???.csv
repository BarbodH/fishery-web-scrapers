267102,jdmls,2008-11-13 17:22:00,575,"Hi Guys  I am looking for a place to buy a bulk qty of  100 or more trout worms.  I am willing to buy more if I have to meet a minimum order qty.  In and around Toronto or GTA ...Also willing to order online, but most places over the border will not ship live bait.  Thanks in advance,  Dave"
267154,kemper,2008-11-13 20:20:00,2232,I can tell you where to get hosed.  Last time I picked up 2 dozen I counted SEVEN.  Thats right  SEVEN  thats a dang buck a worm.
267173,Bigfisherman,2008-11-13 21:45:00,100,"There is a bait shop at Jane & 401, right before 401 going south on the west side, I think its $4.30 per 2 dozen they open as early as 4am."
267176,kemper,2008-11-13 22:13:00,2232,just had a thought  I wonder if you went in and asked a bait shop to put you in touch with thier supplier?
267179,tjsa,2008-11-13 22:33:00,1578,"Are you talking about ""red wigglers"" or nightcrawlers/dew worms. Most places can sell you a ""flat"" of 500 dew worms. I used to buy them that way when I fished every weekend from May opener for walleye until opening of hunting(gun) season. Rarely ran out, even fishing both days on a weekend, and back then cost about $70.00."
267194,Roy,2008-11-13 22:58:00,13728,"For trout worms, (not nightcrawlers) go visit a farmer and if you ask nicely, I'm sure he'd let you run a pitchfork through an old manure pile and get all the trout worms you'll need for a season. It'd be a nice gesture to offer him some fish, a case of beer or a decent bottle of wine."
267256,steelhead hunter,2008-11-14 01:03:00,152,try www.centerpinangling.com they have what you are looking for
267261,BillM,2008-11-14 01:16:00,17367, Live worms?  I don't think so... or I'm blind and just can't find them on their site.
