One message from Gerritt and we are doing Quinte with `ya all..... Shouldnt take me longer then a quick whizz to re-rig the boat...and the gear.`  The wife and I have fished ""The Reach"",  quite a bit recently and last time out we lost a board and the other we lost a snap connectio""n on another board. ....no offence but...(fishing with my better half)...  Seems no one has anymore boards out my way... (I'd like to add that I live in Quinte....and there are no boards available....they have all been sold out at last I looked...and its no wonder)) Anyone have an extra set...I'd gladly purchase them.  Drop me a line and let me know...otherwise we'll see Ya'll at the launch. OK...Im begging now....I need a set of boards...Limit of $100 left/right....  Gerritt...bring them boots sir...bring Ã©m...if you didnt get my PM..lemme know where your staying..K bud.  Everyone have a very safe, fun and successful weekend. bNb"
