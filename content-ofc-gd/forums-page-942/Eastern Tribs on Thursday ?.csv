266653,camillj,2008-11-12 04:31:00,1988,I am considering heading eastward on Thursday ... just wondering if the conditions are right ... dont get me wrong ... I'm going out anyhows ... just looking for a reason not to sleep well tomorrow night  Besides its been too long since my last glimpse of chrome ... but then ... there's also those big fat girls puttin on the feedbag up on the bay ... and team four still needs some Musky-inches decisions decisions !
266659,kemper,2008-11-12 04:42:00,2232,"east is lowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Or at least it was on the weekend, and I dont think its rained enough to come back up to fishable.  I think there is some good rain coming this weekend, but if I was looking for fish I wouldnt be looking east right now"
266664,lew,2008-11-12 09:36:00,12767, It would seem the decision would be an easy one Jon
266696,fishnpro,2008-11-12 14:36:00,93,"I have to agree with kemper, with the low water conditions right now Id take my chances chasing toothy critters. If you can make it down really early you might be able to pop a few but it doesnt last very long. I landed my PB 50"" muskie last year at around the same time of year so I will be after some skies on friday mainly because of the lack of water in the east. Let us know how you do. Good Luck!"
266734,jdmls,2008-11-12 17:57:00,575,"without rain out east,  you will find few and far between .... temps are supposed to bump up into the double digits come thursday,  friday. I would launch the boat."
266740,fishnsled,2008-11-12 18:12:00,3520,"The way the skis were biting and following for me on the weekend, I'd be heading to the bay."
266807,camillj,2008-11-12 22:28:00,1988,Thanks Guys ... I think you know which way I'll be headed .... assuming Matt will still have aboat in the water for me to rent  Will let you know how it goes !
266892,irishfield,2008-11-13 01:29:00,26272,"Don't know who ""Matt"" is Jon... but I noticed Muskie Landing, at Port Severn, still had their rental boats in when I drove by on Monday afternoon."
