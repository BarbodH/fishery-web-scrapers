266705,ccmtcanada,2008-11-12 15:26:00,7971,Wow...my heart was pounding watching this...could only imagine his!!  Great video!
266712,misfish,2008-11-12 15:50:00,29133, Yep mine too. Great vid.
266714,bigugli,2008-11-12 16:10:00,6138,A neat video. Obviously a very well practiced and skilled hunter. It's amazing how close an animal will get to you if they don't smell you and you can stay silent and motionless
266717,BillM,2008-11-12 16:15:00,17367,He would have smelt the piss running down my leg if that was me.

266738,Pachone,2008-11-12 18:07:00,276,Damn... I cant see it.?!  Is there a youtube version?
266811,Ramble,2008-11-12 22:37:00,713,I saw a video yesterday of a moose who mouths the broadhead of a bow hunter who isnt moving.....it was CRAZY.  -R-
266821,Leecher,2008-11-12 23:07:00,7832,I could not get the vid working at work today but now..... HOLLY MOLY the guy looked invisible to the elk  He waited at the very last seconds to move and don't know if he was able to shoot at it.... if he did and was able to target a vital organ..... maybe was able to harvest it  Thanks for the video Patrick.... real awesome Leechman
