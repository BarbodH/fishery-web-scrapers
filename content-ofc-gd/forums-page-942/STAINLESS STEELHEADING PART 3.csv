267160,silvio,2008-11-13 20:55:00,433,I would like to dedicate this post to jdmls. sorry that you had to work bro was a ok day sure you would have put a few in the bag also.  The day started off good in my books I open up my garage to a down poor I thought mint I knew exactly were to hit up first. one the way to the  BBNOTTY house and the trib it kept pouring and I kept smiling. we got to trib number 1 were I see the water had some color but still clear manage one from spot one and it was a big fish.   We could tell the water didn't have enough color for these spooked fish to drop there guard so we went to spot 2 on trib 1. I cross the river and my dad asks me you think thereâ€™s any in here? well I answered his question with this lol. (no one on the side of the river with me to take the pic of me and the fish so I had to lay it down).   We stayed for awhile till my steely senses started to tingle I knew were we had to be so we packed up and went to trib 2. Last time we were at this trib on the rise we drilled them so I was sure it would be the same this time I was correct. BBNOTTY puts the first in the bag after a few minutes of being there.   Shortly after BBNOTTY smacks another one... but when he decided to wash the fish for the pic it released itself lol.( insert pic of 5 lb bow here).  And then another   I had enough and said I need one here now and wouldn't you know rod almost shoots out of my hand and this is what came in.    I ended the day with this fish we were at trib 2 for about an hour not bad for a few hours of fishing my dad got the skunk steelhead are never nice to him.    HEY DAVE IMX??? LOL
