266380,Paulus,2008-11-11 04:35:00,522,"Sorry to piggy-back off your post JDMLS, but I had to. It turns out that I had planned to hit the same trib as those young ruffians today ...  Knowing that steelhead can get pret..ty..spooky in clear water, especially after they've been stung repeatedly   ... I didn't expect quite the blast that Silvio et al. had this weekend.  Good thing, too!   The fish that I saw were extremely spooky and skittish. Generally they avoided the approach even of just the float coming down the river... and given the slight 50km/h BREEZE that we had today, fishing with small floats just wasn't in the cards.  However, a wily old veteran like me still has a few tricks up his sleeve. The best trick: perseverance. If you know that fish are around, keep looking for the one that doesn't know you're there.  Another trick, jigs from a friend of mine. They work!  I didn't get many, but I'm happy with my day   . The best moment came when I was cursing the wind for blowing loops of line off my reel (yet again   ), only to notice that my float had just been viciously tugged 6"" underwater. Despite a frenetic fit of fumbling, I was able to get him nicely hooked, and eventually 10 minutes later, get him landed.  Anyway, I am heading out again tomorrow, so it's bed time now.... here are the pics:              Cheers!  p.-"

266393,solopaddler,2008-11-11 09:44:00,8605,Nice job on the fish buddy.
266398,Billy - Curtiss,2008-11-11 17:09:00,241,Nice work dude! Where can a body purchase those jigs? I've never tried them before.
266418,jdmls,2008-11-11 18:20:00,575,No you didn't    But I will PM you next time I'm going down to fish YOUR pool.....I could use a good camera man  FYI....Everybody on FF.net lurks this board or is memeber... so reaaally......There is no need to post your 3 fish on both boards
266423,ccmtcanada,2008-11-11 18:34:00,7971,Aweome pictures again!!  Bly and I are thinking of heading out Friday morning if the rains on Thrusday don't blow everything out.  I can relate to fishing in the wind like that...the last time I tried my float almost hit me in the head after each cast...LOL
266426,highdrifter,2008-11-11 18:41:00,2534," LOL  It's our second official language...  I do it because I can!  Wasn't it you that passed along the message?!  And I always thought that Spanglish was a bit of a chick flick...  Last time I let a chick pick, I directed her to darkest part of the theater, just in case I got bored...  wuuuuut HD"
266432,Scott S,2008-11-11 18:52:00,203,Can we buy those flies somewhere or those handmade. Sure would like some of those jigs. Scooter

266598,Paulus,2008-11-12 02:12:00,522,"  woah! easy!    don't know what the issue is? To be truthful, only a couple of those fish came from that pool. The others came from some other spots on my river. By association it's ""my"" pool you fished only because it's ""my"" river  - but you're welcome to fish there any time      p.-"
266603,Paulus,2008-11-12 02:18:00,522," Rube = épais.  But Wallacio is referring only to anyone who didn't have anything nice to say, I'm sure .  p.-"
266604,TerryC,2008-11-12 02:21:00,196,"Awesome fish, at least your creeks out east have a little water in them. It's really screwed up down south."
266608,Paulus,2008-11-12 02:23:00,522," Actually, they are pretty dismally low here too. I was just lucky to find a few that hadn't been poked or spooked yet. It was hard work, and co-o-o-o-old...  p.-"
266610,wallacio,2008-11-12 02:28:00,475,"  Actually, I was just referring to you HeeHee!"
266629,figureight,2008-11-12 03:26:00,40,Don't see what the new hype is of people taking pics of every shaker they catch?
266639,Paulus,2008-11-12 03:54:00,522, Merci  Mais celle-là je l'ai prise au caviar  p.-
