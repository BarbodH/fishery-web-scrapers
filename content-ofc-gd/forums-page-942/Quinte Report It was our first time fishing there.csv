266073,Vanselena,2008-11-10 03:06:00,269,"Well we went down to the Quinte Area and fished where everyone else was fishing. When we got back to the dock all we heard from everyone was how bad the fishing was. No one was catching any fish. When we opened our box the questions from other anglers were flying...where were you? How deep you fishing? What were you using? Well it seems we were using the same lures as everyone else, same speeds too, only difference we could figure was we were using Torpedo Divers... Here are a few photo's from our trip. We went 4 for 7. Thanks DT10Sam for the tips, maybe next time we can get out in the same boat   "

266154,forrest,2008-11-10 14:19:00,1032,I heard bananas work a little better than the divers.  According to the pics they catch fish 3:2 when compared to divers! http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=25385

266654,jediangler,2008-11-12 04:32:00,1923,"Nice eyes, congrats. Personally I found the meat changed colour, and taste, when they exceeded 3lbs at BOQ. I respect your right to eat your catch though, enjoy."
266694,Pondo,2008-11-12 14:23:00,36,"""only difference we could figure was we were using Torpedo Divers""  Wow!  I've see them but never seen them used.  Exactly how do they work better than other lead weights?"
