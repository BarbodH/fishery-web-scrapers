266447,Ramble,2008-11-11 20:00:00,713,Went to the ceremony here in Peterborough.  -R-
266450,rickster,2008-11-11 20:12:00,495,just read this on tsn  http://www.tsn.ca/blogs/bob_mckenzie/?id=255515
266467,bigugli,2008-11-11 20:50:00,6138,"I remember in private those I knew who died peacekeeping or in training. Regretably, we also laid to rest a good friend today.  I admit I turn into a blubbering mess every year. We never forget. In that vein http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA4hxcdaMn0  The lament is called ""Flowers of the Forest"" it is played to mourn the fallen. The dead, the missing, the wounded who never heal. Those we knew. Those we would never have the honour of knowing."
266480,lew,2008-11-11 21:27:00,12767,"The Fire Department always has a contingent that marches to the Cenotaph behind the Vets and I took part in that parade for many years, and then even after my retirement I've still always attended the ceremonies, but unfortunately my wife had an 11:00 AM doctors appointment today that she couldn't get out of or change and I had to drive her.  I can't remember the last time I didn't attend the ceremonies and I actually feel guilty that I wasn't there today to honour all those that paid the ultimate.  I was certainly there in spirit though."
266486,Rattletrap2,2008-11-11 21:55:00,1652,"We stopped ALL classes and ALL students and staff took part in a short assembly this morning. We played the video of ""A Pittance of Time"" by Terry Kelly and stood for our two minutes of silence. I have seen this many times now, but it always moves me the same.  There really is no way we can ever repay these men, women, and children (many were not even old enough to be there) for their courage, valour, and in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom we all enjoy today.  For those still fighting for the cause, wherever that may be, I am truly thankful and wish them a speedy and safe return home.  Godspeed"
266491,Rich,2008-11-11 22:15:00,3927,We had the 2 minutes of silence at work. I was glad to see every single customer stop what they were doing and stop to remember as well. I hate when someone continues talking or doing what they're doing during the 2 minutes of silence. I find it a huge showing of disrespect.
266517,holdfast,2008-11-11 23:10:00,1813,"I know one thing I didnt do, That's Christmas shopping at Walmarts or any where else.  Totally disgusting, I don't ever remember Christmas Carols, Tree shopping before Remembrance Day.  The Kicker is that I didnt see anybody wearing a Poppy working there."
266545,bucktail,2008-11-12 00:15:00,1857,Remebering my recently passed father and his many tours to places in the world that didnt want peace but he stood up for it. Golan Heights Sinia Cypress Ismalia Egypt  Just hope those people in those contries even thank the boys with the blue beret  D
266547,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-12 00:16:00,3761,Our school had a excellent service today
266549,tibbs,2008-11-12 00:18:00,650,At school we had an assembly to commemorate the veterans that were former students at my school that served in the military.
266552,danc,2008-11-12 00:22:00,4677,I pulled my crew aside this morning and we had our remembrance on the job. I do this every year.
266726,kentooley,2008-11-12 17:19:00,208,I had one of the most moving experiences of my life yesterday. After taking part in the ceremony at Queen's Park in downtown Toronto I was invited to the Royal Canadian Legion (branch no. 66). All our troops are heroes but I met a veteran that blew me away. He was probably 80 years of age... (Dieppe)... was POW....had more medals than I could count. That man( Irwin ) actually thanked ME for the support!!! WOW!!!!  Chris
266900,chickenhawk,2008-11-13 01:56:00,612,i bought 3 poppies??? but as don cherry says..........the LEAST you can do is buy a poppy     Hawk
266928,TerryC,2008-11-13 03:06:00,196,"I was driving into work listening to the cerimonies on 1010 CFRB feeling sort of lousy that I had no way to stop for a moment of silence as I drove. Then I thought what the heck I'll just pull of to the shoulder and put on the flashers. So I did right on the 403, apparently I was not the only person with the same thought because within about a minute 4 or 5 other cars pulled in behind me. We waited about 2 minutes and the slowly pulled back on the highway.  It warmed my heart to realize that alot of other poor buggers on their way to work were having the same feelings as me.  Proudly Canadian."
266966,kentooley,2008-11-13 05:20:00,208, Every once in awhile I lose faith in humanity. It's guys like you that restore it!!  Thanx  Chris
