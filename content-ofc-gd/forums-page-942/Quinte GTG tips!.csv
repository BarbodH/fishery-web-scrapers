Here's mine: As most will be wearing Floatation Suits, here's a tip. If your returning to the cabin for lunch, take your suit off and turn it inside out.  Same for over night. You will be amazed at how much moisture builds up inside your suit, while you wear it. Can make for a very uncomfortable day on the water. Ok... your turn! HH"

If you are running a tiller bring some goggles or your tears will freeze. If its raining it won't hurt your eyes.Poor man's side console  Bring a bag of salt or sand to the launch if you don't have a 4 X 4 keep some metal traction aids in your vehicle.
