958420,G.mech,2016-02-19 11:53:00,830,"Just a heads up, SAIL has one of their 15% off everything sales going on until Sunday.  Somebody was looking for a Terrova a few weeks ago and they have the Terrova 80/60/US2/ with i-Pilot for $1750 (less the 15%) with another $100 mail in rebate which is a very, very good price.  Disclaimer: I am only giving this heads up for people who want to go buy something on sale.  I am not condoning purchases at a big box vs mom'n pop store and and not suggesting Sail is better or worse than Cabela's, Bass Pro, or Lebarons so please don't vilify me for posting this......"
958425,BassMan11,2016-02-19 12:56:00,583,"It wasn't me who inquired,  but I bought a Terrova 55/54/US2 w/Ipilot for $1495 all in with the rebate. Just a quick update.. it is a ""we pay the tax"" event and you get a dollar per thrust pound for a rebate... so my rebate is $55. Good deal regardless.  Thank you for the heads up. I am sure people will appreciate it."
958477,Raycaster,2016-02-19 19:48:00,528,G.Mech I appreciate the reminder but.... Bought yesterday and rebate sent today!  I was waiting for the 15% sale because I was loaded up with Gift Cards from there. The 80 also had US2 (not really needed but nice option) plus the $80 rebate. Sucks that the $80 rebate is in Canadian dollars if unit purchased in Canada... Now I'm just nitpicking! I'm a happy camper and have the 8' box secured away until spring.  Now time to squirrel away some loonies for the QUICK RELEASE BRACKET and 60A breaker too.
958480,Acountdeleted,2016-02-19 19:52:00,2562,Anyone know if Sail has the new live target stuff in yet? Usually I find they tend to get the new stuff in before any other place.
958486,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-19 20:37:00,937,^^^ I did see the livetarget sunfish at sail yesterday.
958492,AKRISONER,2016-02-19 21:25:00,5558,  I CAME FOR THE ANGRY MOB  but have been left disappointed by Mech's disclaimer
958493,G.mech,2016-02-19 21:45:00,830,  I CAME FOR THE ANGRY MOB  but have been left disappointed by Mech's disclaimer  That's exactly the group I was worried about.....it's not paranoia if you know they're out there to get you.
958495,BassMan11,2016-02-19 21:55:00,583,Ottawa store had them. Bought a handful. They are smaller then I thought they would be.
958502,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-19 22:20:00,937,^^^ Which size did you get?  They come in 2 sizes and my location only had the smaller version.  I passed for now
958534,BassMan11,2016-02-20 02:37:00,583,I believe the 3 inch. Larger size is only a half inch bigger I think. I am a sucker for a new top water lure.
