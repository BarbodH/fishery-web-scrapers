958315,Dara,2016-02-18 18:34:00,3052,Minimum bid $750.00...I don't think so...and why would they buy it in the first place to put 702 km on it in 15 years
958322,Fisherman,2016-02-18 19:53:00,7201,"Who knows, ex RCMP vehicle.  Maybe didn't suit their needs and stored away until someone opened a door surprised to find a couple of sleds."
958323,cheaptackle,2016-02-18 19:53:00,849,"Says it comes with ""no keys"" so I guess they couldn't start it...  Michael"
958327,irishfield,2016-02-18 21:20:00,26272,My mint '98 Skidoo 500 Touring only has 1543 miles on it. Father in law never used it.. I use it for ice fishing trips only.
958332,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-18 21:52:00,8243,It only went from headquarters to Tim Hortons and back once a shift.
958403,ctdd2006,2016-02-19 06:11:00,531,"Minimum bid $750.00...I don't think so...and why would they buy it in the first place to put 702 km on it in 15 years you wouldn't get my 95 with 2500 kms for 750.  Never.  Great lil sled.  I often leave my ""big sled"" behind on bushwhacking back woods trips behind and take my 10 y/o's 95 Bravo instead.  If you have kids and like punching into backwoods lakes....that's a steal.  I bought my boy one of those three years ago instead of the ""kitty kat"" and it's my fave.  Obviously we ain't the trail ridin types."
958404,chris.brock,2016-02-19 06:16:00,4053,"I could sell that for $2500 easy, all day long, next November, where I live."
958407,ctdd2006,2016-02-19 06:37:00,531,I've been offered 2k many times for mine.  I paid 5hundred for a cosmetic wreck but engine strong LT trapper and put a new track on it .... grinded/sanded and painted tunnel and skiis and recovered seat.  I turn down 2k often.
958491,Joeytier,2016-02-19 21:24:00,3990,My knees are starting to hurt just looking at it...great price though for a seemingly mint machine.  2001 is basically brand new for a Bravo.  Hard to find one newer than 1995 these days.
958573,porkpie,2016-02-20 14:15:00,2521,It won't sell for that price.  A lot of the GC surplus stuff goes for big bucks.  Sometimes there are deals though.  They do closed bidding to intentionally drive up prices.
959077,Dara,2016-02-23 16:03:00,3052,"I bought as 83 brand new and was continually stuck with it...was not impressed...others like them. On Simcoe where there is not much snow they are fine. I towed my hut with it lots, but in the bush in deep snow, no thanks"
959081,Sinker,2016-02-23 16:21:00,8692,You are the first and only person I have ever heard say that about a bravo. I have taken a LT bravo to some crazy places where other sleds wouldn't stand a chance. If they had one with a 440 in it it would be the cats meow.  S.
959082,Terry,2016-02-23 16:22:00,14456,The long track is pretty good. And if you get stuck you throw it over you shoulder and carry it.   Ok not really but even in deep snow you can swing the rear end right around. Try doing that with most of today's machines
959083,Sinker,2016-02-23 16:53:00,8692,"I won't be throwing my long track venture around that's for sure. Its pretty good in deep snow, but its no bravo.  S."
959084,Dara,2016-02-23 16:58:00,3052,I didn't have the long track
959090,porkpie,2016-02-23 17:23:00,2521,That there is your problem
959162,chris.brock,2016-02-23 23:14:00,4053,"I road a short track Bravo for 2 years, it was good in the bush with deep snow and better than any other short track sled available now.  I took my brother's newer 4 stroke Phazer, rider forward, into the bush last year, totally useless, had to turn back. With my buddies Nitro I would never even think of leaving the groomed trail"
959241,Joeytier,2016-02-24 03:16:00,3990,Yamaha's are front heavy cinderblocks off trail.  My voyageur will putt around on bottomless powder all day.  Doesn't have the jam to trench down and pull thru like an RMK but it breaks trail much better and can actually reverse without terrible trenching.
959252,chris.brock,2016-02-24 03:45:00,4053,"I've had and rode tonnes of sleds. For what I like to do, the BR LT is the best sled ever made. And I can admit when something I've bought is crap."
959254,irishfield,2016-02-24 03:50:00,26272,"Don't forget that a lot of sled issues are clutch set up. Terry and I have identical Skidoo 500's. Same track, same engine HP. I can creep away and even stop and then drive up a portage hill. Terry's could get stuck on flat ground as his clutch was set to engage late, at high rpm and spins the track.. while mine will just walk way."
959262,NAW,2016-02-24 04:16:00,4022,"I have a short track.  It was given to me for free.  Amazing little sled, but the short tracks do get stuck pretty easy.  I've investigated doing some modifications to it.  Buying a long track and long track suspension.  Building many of my own parts and sheet metal work...  But.  The reality is, I don't get stuck enough to make it worth all the time and effort  I would rather buy a quad .  Lake Simcoe (when it freezes) is great 75% of the winter with a quad."
