I haven't ever put in much time on the Thames. I fish the grand a lot. So far just 1 pike in 2016. No walleyes yet. Will be interesting to see how the last few weeks of the season play out. I remember having a few good days on the grand just before the season closed 3 or 4 years ago. Edit to add: I'm heading out to a spot on the grand right now to see if I can get a bite or two."
