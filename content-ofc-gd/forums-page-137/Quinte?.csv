958460,jimmer,2016-02-19 16:45:00,2730,I had a friend go there twice in the past two weeks. He went out around Belleville and Trenton. Skunked both times. I'm thinking the Picton area would be better.
958463,G.mech,2016-02-19 17:56:00,830,"From what I hear, the ice is very, very sketchy in most areas and with all the snow on Tuesday it would likely be difficult to get around.  I'm no expert on Quinte but I do know that the ice is very unpredictable at the best of times and this is certainly not the best of times....  If you go, I wouldn't venture too far from other fisherman without some local guidance."
958464,Sinker,2016-02-19 18:21:00,8692,"I haven't even fished quinte this year and I usually fish it once a week. I went down there one time a few weeks ago for a look and couldn't even get out to my spot so turned around and came home. Sketchy ice for sure. It may be better now, but I don't have any first hand intel. I could offer some access points and possible safe ice locations though if you'd like to take a trip and find out for yourself. Just PM me if your interested. They got nailed pretty good with snow on tuesday, so I would think getting around would be miserable at best, and taking a machine is not advisable IMO.  S."
958476,Acountdeleted,2016-02-19 19:48:00,2562,With the currents and warm temps Quinte is super sketchy this winter. I would avoid it unless you knew the area really well. Too many spots with 2 inches of 'white crust'
