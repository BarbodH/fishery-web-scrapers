958233,206,2016-02-18 03:17:00,563,"I missed the boat/fishing show this past weekend where apparently X-zone lures have been re-introduced, now owned by VRX Fishing Product (The Rod Glove)?  Anyone have any info?  Sounds like good news to me.  "
958234,Bondar,2016-02-18 03:21:00,817,Yes they are back
958243,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-18 04:30:00,937,"https://www.facebook.com/xzonelures/?fref=ts  X Zone Lures is back and better than ever! The #1 Drop Shot bait, the Slammer, is back. We are proud to say that we had a very successful product line reintroduction at the Toronto Spring Boat and Fishing Show this past weekend. The support from anglers that have come to trust X-Zone lures over the years was tremendous!  "
958244,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-18 04:31:00,937,I saw them at the show but I didn't realize it was them at the time. I got the booth confused with another company.
958262,misfish,2016-02-18 12:19:00,29133,"So if Marks mug is on there,he must still have some % of the company? Im glad they are back."
958265,bobowski,2016-02-18 12:50:00,360,Spoke to someone representing them and he said they will have new product available hopefully by May of this year.
958281,Rob,2016-02-18 14:54:00,467,I hope Mark did alright with the deal on selling X-Zone. He put a lot into that business and developed a great product. Plus he's a super nice guy.  Rob C
958290,Bondar,2016-02-18 16:04:00,817,Mark is no longer owner but is working with the company
958341,misfish,2016-02-18 22:40:00,29133,"Mark is no longer owner but is working with the company  That I know, I just hope they bring the same product. Im sure Mark, would want it that way."
958360,DropShot'r,2016-02-18 23:46:00,62,Quite excited to hear this news.  My cashe of Slammers and Swammers will do me till new product is available!!!
958444,shimano19,2016-02-19 14:39:00,196,Do you know who will be selling them again
958453,Floren Lukatsky,2016-02-19 15:52:00,23,yes Mark still makes the product but he doesn't own it. i imagine majority of the specialty shops will be carrying the product as they were before.
958598,Dave Bailey,2016-02-20 17:16:00,1641,This is great news! I was wondering how long my meagre stash would hold out.
958616,landry,2016-02-20 18:51:00,1005,I have already stockpiled over a Hundred swammers.
958620,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-20 19:14:00,8243,I had a package of original Swammers without the paddle tail and they worked very well for me. I'm going to stock up for sure. Great news.  Anyone recommend a specific X for Smallies? I'm thinking leech's for sure.
958848,riddickulous,2016-02-22 05:03:00,27,"I spoke to them at the Show, they mentioned they will be hand pouring the lures, resulting in a softer plastic."
958960,misfish,2016-02-22 21:56:00,29133,"I spoke to them at the Show, they mentioned they will be hand pouring the lures, resulting in a softer plastic.  Mark Im pretty sure, hand poured his baits.  If anyone see,s the shiver shad out any where, please let me no PLEASE. TY"
959074,Thrilla,2016-02-23 15:41:00,164,"Too little, too late imo. Many similar products that have taken over the market.  Anglers choice sniper shads are all that is in my box now.More action than the swammer too..."
959080,musky_hunter,2016-02-23 16:15:00,328,"mark is not doing the pouring, vrx is."
959093,adempsey,2016-02-23 17:38:00,1498,"Too little, too late imo. Many similar products that have taken over the market.  Anglers choice sniper shads are all that is in my box now.More action than the swammer too...  For me, it's about access.   I am not paying $15.00 for shipping.   I was able to find X-Zone products all over, but the others...not so much.  I'd buy them if I could find them and there are plenty out there being made.   Although, looks like Anglers Choice products are in a lot of stores, I'll have to go and see if I can find them.   I doubt it's too late at all if they maintained the same vendors.  I even came across some Strike Zone slammers at the Boating show last weekend!"
959096,misfish,2016-02-23 18:07:00,29133,"Yes I know. Mark is there to advise, from what I understand. I said he hand poured his baits."
959101,musky_hunter,2016-02-23 18:47:00,328,His initial products were hand poured
959118,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-23 20:19:00,937,"X Zone Lures Alert!As many of you know, X Zone Lures was off of the market for about 18 months. Recently, we, VRX Fishing Products, have purchased X Zone Lures from the previous owner and creator, Mark Kulik.  It is our intention that we work closely with Mark and bring this product back to the market as True Hand Poured lures.We want want to honor Mark and his legacy of this truly incredible line of baits.  After a very successful launch last week, we were alerted to the fact that someone was going out to retailers and individuals and offering fake X-Zone products in X Zone Lures packaging. While we can not stop people from duplicating our bait shapes, we can not tolerate someone using our packaging and brand name as that is trademarked in both the USA and Canada.  This is a very unfortunate situation but we will get through it.  I urge you not to purchase these fake products if they offered to you in X Zone packaging. These products are not hand poured and in no represent the quality of a True Hand Pour bait that we are offering to the market.  We will be releasing our products to credible retailers in early May of this year and we look forward to serving you as fans of the X Zone Lures brand.  I appeal to your sense of integrity in this matter and I want to thank you for your support of the X Zone Lures brand.  Thank you"
959330,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-24 17:32:00,937,Are you curious about some of the NEW Xzone hand poured lures and the colours? Here is a sneek peek of what will be available in May. ‪#‎bass‬ ‪#‎fishing‬ ‪#‎xzonelures‬ ‪#‎newproduct‬
