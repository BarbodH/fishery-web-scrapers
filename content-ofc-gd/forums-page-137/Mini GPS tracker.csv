Or even when lending the car to the kids for the night  Anyone ever tried these ? Say the battery life is 365 days? http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/trackr-trackr-bravo-bluetooth-tracker-3-pack-only-at-best-buy-tb001slv3pkeu/10396290.aspx?path=33789f1775a9ef3c548cebebda03c255en02  "
958569,Fishwilly,2016-02-20 13:29:00,206,I'm thinking if it's using bluetooth the range wouldn't be that great. So if a thief makes off with your goods pretty sure it's gone.

Better than nothing.  But I doubt that it will help you find your car topper that someone stashed on a back lake...  ""They also try to find your stuff when it’s farther away near you: Both of these products use the concept of “crowdsourcing” and GPS. Crowd GPS is based on the idea that if you can’t find something, say, your keys, maybe someone else can — as long as they also happen to be using the TrackR or Tile app (iOS and Android), with Bluetooth turned on and crowd GPS enabled. Your lost keys will give off a unique identifier that can be detected by other people’s apps, sending you GPS data about where they are."" http://recode.net/2015/04/01/trackr-vs-tile-the-lost-and-found-face-off/"
