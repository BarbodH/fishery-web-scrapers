Just so much more comfy and I hate wearing my one piece suit in the hut. Most times the last couple years I wear my duck hunting gear on the ice. Just more comfy and its nice to take the parka off in the hut and just wear the bibs.  I like the once piece on first or last ice, but for the most part, I hate wearing a one piece suit, and I don't plan on falling thru the ice.  S."
958522,Dutch01,2016-02-20 01:02:00,1431," Next up was the Mustang MS-195 Atlantic Class.  The suit fit perfectly, and I was sold. Great suit, perfect fit, and only $389.  Suits bought by 830, we decided to head for gilford to test them out.  Sadly we only saw dink perch, and caught a handful of them only.  The only issue I had was being too warm!. I will definitely wear fewer base layers next time.  Anyways, thanks for the help all."

I bought Arctic armor for my dad last year and it's awesome suit,  but for $200 this suit is a great deal. Brand is gks - Canadian company http://www.ganka.ca"
958537,Dutch01,2016-02-20 02:53:00,1431,What do you guys wear for base layers? Someone told me fleece is best.....
958775,John Bacon,2016-02-21 23:45:00,3277,"How did the guy drown in a floater suit???I've heard they lose buoyancy over time, maybe it was past its service life?  I didn't want to highjack the other thread so I thought I would post this here where it is more on topic.Many (most?) of the so called floater suits are not approved as a PFD.  That raises the question; just how much floatation does do they (non-approved ones) provide?  I suspect that if they don't have approval it is because the don't meet the requirement for a PFD (I believe that is a mimimum of 15 pounds of floatation).I wonder if people are getting a false sense of security when the where a 'floater suit' that is not approved for use as a PFD."
958779,Woodsman,2016-02-22 00:12:00,1286,Many of the unapproved ones don't have the certification due to the manufacturors not summiting them for Canadian DOT testing process. Some may very well pass the testing but due to predicted sale volumes certification may not be monetarily responsible. There are cases of PFD's getting US approval but not Canadian for this reason.
958780,Dutch01,2016-02-22 00:22:00,1431,"Mine is TC approved. Not to be morbid, but I kinda thought I'd have a half hour or an hour before hypothermia sets in...."
958811,G.mech,2016-02-22 01:49:00,830,"There are many classes of 'survival' and 'immersion' suits.  The best ones are the immersion suits (like you see on ""Deadliest Catch"") with built in boots, gloves, and hoods.  These will give you a couple of hours in icy water but can only be worn in an emergency and are donned just as you abandon ship.  They are totally impractical for walking around or working in.  The typical suits we wear ice fishing are not dry suits and whether they're one piece or two, you are going to get wet if you go in.  They keep you afloat and offer some level of hypothermia protection but it's really only minutes in ice cold water and are more effective in warmer water.  That said, they are whole lot better than nothing if you end up in the water."
958824,Dutch01,2016-02-22 02:14:00,1431,Well then I guess I better use those minutes to haul my butt back up on the ice!  I never have more than two pops on the ice. I hate to speculate but from the sounds of the story in the other thread I think alcohol may have been a factor. Regardless it's a sad outcome for a day of fishing.
958846,riddickulous,2016-02-22 04:53:00,27,"I have been running a salus endurance class float suite for about 6 years now, and am very happy with it.  One thing I would caution you on about salus. They don't seem to be designed for heavy set folks. and it's hard (impossible) to fit a pair of Baffin titans on and actually fully zip the ankle zippers.  My two cents.  I am a strong salus supporter. But you kind of need to be fit to wear one. +1 on this  I have the 1400TL pants for the 2 piece and the leg zippers are tight going over the boots however I've never tried going under the boots as I prefer the pants going over.  The Salus is built really well, I had a pair of Arctic Armour that I sold because I felt the Salus is built much better."
958888,BITEME,2016-02-22 14:35:00,1968,What do you guys wear for base layers? Someone told me fleece is best.....  to be honest my drawers and a tshirt
958889,BITEME,2016-02-22 14:37:00,1968,Good info here.  Thanx.   I've been favoring the Arctic Armour on another post.  But I'm the guy who wants to try it before buying it.  Where would I find a retailer for Salus comfort lite 1400 or the Odessy model.  Do you know the price of the 1400?  take a trip to waterloo and go right to the source
958900,riddickulous,2016-02-22 15:52:00,27,"What do you guys wear for base layers? Someone told me fleece is best.....  Moisture wicking base layer to keep the sweat off the skin. I wear a pair of fleece pants on top mostly because I prefer not to walk around wearing black tights!  Don't wear cotton/jeans, synthetics and wool are good for keeping the sweat away esp if you sweat a lot."
958903,Dutch01,2016-02-22 16:25:00,1431,"Yeah I wore a hoodie, and when I got back in the truck it was soaked with sweat and cold as ice when I leaned on the seat. Definitely need some fleece in there somewhere"
959044,Sinker,2016-02-23 04:24:00,8692,"A quality base layer is worth every cent. Spend some money on a good base and the rest doesnt really matter much. I wear fleece if its real cold, but usually just whatever pants and a hoody with a fleece zip up over top. If its really cold i break outthe hand knit merino wool sweater. Its like putting on a heater.  S."
959054,wormdunker,2016-02-23 12:35:00,1711,"Yup, X 2 on the merino wool.  I recently purchased Icebreaker 260 weight long johns & top.  Awesome under my floater suit.  Many advantages to wearing merino wool including - if it gets wet , it is still warm.  I could not imagine the price of a hand knit merino wool sweater.  I paid a healthy price for my icebreaker underwear & I only have 6 more monthly payments!!  LOL!"
959065,Sinker,2016-02-23 14:12:00,8692,Price isn't bad at all if you know someone who knits. I bet you could get a couple made for the price of your base layer.  S.

Most important are two pairs of socks.  I wear one polyester pair and a really good quality Merino wool sock over that.   Rarely have issues, and even if my feet get cold, I just walk around a bit and I am fine.   I am rarely in a hut."
958176,Dutch01,2016-02-17 20:45:00,1431,"I've finally decided to drop some coin on a floater suit. I'm stuck between two suits, and could use some feedback from owners of the following suits:  1) Mustang MS-195 (the ""Atlantic Class"" suit, NOT the Integrity suit) 2) Salus Comfort Lite 1400  I've always thought the mustang was the standard bearer, but read really good things about the the Salus.  I believe both are Transport Canada approved, which is important because I will use it in my boat in spring and fall.  Anyways any feedback (here or by PM) would be much appreciated.  Dutch"
958180,misfish,2016-02-17 21:06:00,29133,"Are you an open fisher or i a portable fisher?  I dont own one of these,but asking as if you are using a portable, a 2 pice would be my choice. Able to take the coat off and fish in comfort. I would still use a two piece in the open, but a one will hold your heat better.  I would go with the salus brand. it is moveable material.  I watched three guys on the weekend put on one piece suits right out of thier cars. They were fighting to put them on. They freeze up quick."
958186,Pigeontroller,2016-02-17 21:15:00,2793,Make sure its comfortable sitting!

I also would like to use it in my boat (16' side console) in spring and fall.  I feel like the one piece is safer, but I will have to sacrifice some comfort. I'm hearing the Salus may be more comfortable than the mustang. It's also a little cheaper....."
958189,smitty55,2016-02-17 21:52:00,928,"Not the brands you are looking at but I have an Arctic Armor suit that is great. Lightweight, very warm and comfortable to wear. Doesn't get all stiff in the cold. Insultex is waterproof, windproof and very buoyant. The amount in one suit will float 700 lb. Not coastguard approved but that's not an issue for me. Check out the videos on line to see it in action.  Cheers"

I bought the 195 and i like it...its the one to buy. If its cold enough for a suit than its 1 piece for me. I stuck with the Mustang because they make good stuff and its what i had. I wonder what would happen if you had a non approved suit and were not wearing it (or just the bottoms) and you got stopped by the ""MAN"" while on the water, dont imagine you need one on the ice"
958196,Bondar,2016-02-17 22:08:00,817,"Doesn't matter really if it's transport approved as long as you have the proper amount of approved pfds somewhere in the boat, I wear an auto inflate pfd  with my artic armour suit in the boat, I'd suggest the same if you go two piece and don't wear the jacket, last thing I want is pants on that float and not my upper body"

Try sitting, pretend-castng, twisting,etc. I have a 1-piece Helly Hansen (which is a step below what you're looking at, i think) and it's pretty comfortable once worn in..  You can also still hang the top off iwth the suspenders on (like a 2 piece), if you're too hot."

Comfortable, warm and you have an internal zipper for when you have to relieve yourself.   Used to be cheaper compared to Mustang (Salus wasn't really as common when I bought mine).  I would just try them on and see what's more comfortable.  They are all going to save you equally well.   I believe both Mustang and Salus products are made in Canada too."

Everyone carries the mustang classic and/or integrity, but I can't seem to find the Mustang Atlantic class in stock in my size, only a special order. It's great advice to not only try it on but move around, cast, sit, etc. I wouldn't likely have thought of that and I can't do that with a special order.  The Salus is cheaper and in stock so I will try that one on for size and see what happens.  Thanks OFC"
958220,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-18 01:17:00,8243,So what if it's not Trans. Canada approved. Does it replace a PFD on a boat if it is approved?
958222,Dutch01,2016-02-18 01:28:00,1431,"According to Salus website it is TC approved so it can be used in place of a pfd.  As I understand it, if a suit is not TC approved you must be able to put your  TC approved PFD over the suit on demand by a CO."

I did that and the bib on the pants almost reach my neck, allowing for lots of movement and heat retention up my back and front. When temps allow, you can take off the jacket and still be covered or you can un-zip the bib to allow cooling. It also allows you more range of movement. The down side, should you go in the drink, is that a two piece has a shorter window of survival, about 7 minutes less, then a one piece. HH"
