All you have to do is deliver it or arrange pick up from your hotel. He's easy to reach on his cell. I have more pics from an other outing. I caught 16 fish in 3 hours last December, went out with him 2x...  http://s1275.photobucket.com/user/Shloim1/library/ "

The picture of you wearing a winter coat isn't the weather I would expect though. I haven't been in over 10 years and have always wanted to fish there but so little time and it might cut into my poolside happy hours. I saw some monster Bass in a pond on a Golf Course in Runaway Bay. The smallest had to be 5 pounds. Thanks for the lead, you never know.  Johnny D"
