957822,manitoubass2,2016-02-14 21:16:00,11391,"Yep, eagles often go at fish that are too big to carry  But id bet its from an eagle( not that we will ever know)"
957874,BillM,2016-02-15 01:07:00,17367,"If it was a bird it would have puncture wounds, not scrapes.  I'd guess another big big fish."
957897,manitoubass2,2016-02-15 04:07:00,11391,I disagree
957909,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-15 10:15:00,8243,It has a puncture wound Bill. I would have liked to have seen the other side of Mr. Pike.
957912,Whitespinnerbait,2016-02-15 11:43:00,2038,Definitely not from a bird of prey.....scars are way too big.  Prop? Mishandling from humans
957917,sauce,2016-02-15 13:04:00,219,"I remember way back seeing pictures of a trout that had swam through a discarded six pack ring. The fish got stuck but didn't seem to mind. Eventually someone caught it and thought it would be a nice gesture to free it from the plastic. The cut/ scar that was left looked a lot like this pikes scars. If I had to guess, that pike has been swimming around wearing a plastic bag or with a piece of line wrapped around it.  It recently freed itself and now has scars as evidence. No one will ever really know what happened to this pike. If it's over 30"" long and escaped the jaws of something bigger??  Wow!  How big is that something bigger??"

957926,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-15 14:41:00,937,I'm stumped to what it could be.  Here's the other side...     Top side...  
957932,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-15 15:09:00,8243,"I like the 6 pac theory until I saw the other side, pristine, a plastic ring would go all the way around the fish I believe. The evidence leads to a prop now, but what about the puncture wound? I love a good mystery. The fish is talking but we aren't listening close enough."
957980,Ron,2016-02-15 21:56:00,1683,"If the pike was caught on the great lakes system, i would lean towards a lamprey."
957999,John Bacon,2016-02-16 00:51:00,3277,"If the pike was caught on the great lakes system, i would lean towards a lamprey.  How would a lamprey leave a long gash with its circular mouth?  Unless the pike cut it self trying to remove the lamprey."
958013,BITEME,2016-02-16 03:30:00,1968,Well after seeing the other side I would like to change my answer to big bird the reason the singles on the other side I would say it was in shallow and got the back talon in and two toes on the front lots of struggling probably tried to punch the back one though again and the front two ripped through and you caught it and the bird had to try again ???? Peter
958020,chris.brock,2016-02-16 04:37:00,4053,I'm guessing disease. The wounds don't look like a bird or fish attack. It could be the healing stage of lymphosarcoma    This stage is when the tumors are in the healing process. Sometimes this can be mistaken for things like lamprey hits or in this case maybe boat prop damage. About 50%+ of our pike caught this weekend had similar wounds. stage2.JPG http://hotspotoutdoors.com/forums/topic/44139-esocid-lymphosarcoma/

958033,Roy,2016-02-16 14:09:00,13728,"Kinda strange that reading through all of this, almost no one entertains the notion that a human could have caused it. Birds. other fish, and disease, but no props."
958036,Headhunter,2016-02-16 14:52:00,5703,Someone dropped a banana in the water... HH
958039,ehg,2016-02-16 16:19:00,2666,"40 HP Yamaha.... a four stroke I'd say. I could be wrong. Yeah prop. Pretty obvious . At least kinder, gentler winternet  meandering here now."
958040,manitoubass2,2016-02-16 16:27:00,11391,Yeah but what kinda prop/pitch etc?  I NEED DETAILS!!!!
958044,BillM,2016-02-16 17:58:00,17367,"Yeah prop. Pretty obvious . At least kinder, gentler winternet  meandering here now.  A prop would have ripped that fish apart.  Unless maybe we're talking a Minn Kota or something."
958047,ehg,2016-02-16 18:03:00,2666, A prop would have ripped that fish apart.  Unless maybe we're talking a Minn Kota or something. Obviously the prop just nicked the fish before it scooted instantly in pain. Surely you know best however.
958049,BillM,2016-02-16 18:14:00,17367,Obviously the prop just nicked the fish before it scooted instantly in pain. Surely you know best however.  I've seen what a propeller can do first hand (Loss of a childs leg).   You can think that was a prop all you want.
958142,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-17 09:50:00,8243,"It's been a while eh boys? Play nice, nice. Someones dog got a hold of the fish before it was released."
958317,jedimaster,2016-02-18 18:56:00,3472,"I don't think it would be a prop. I would say some sort of disease. I have personally seen prop scars in fish and the marks have always been perfectly parallel. The leading edge scar is at a pretty angle difference. plus there is some scaring healed up in between. Maybe an eagle but I dunno, I saw a few of those in BC as well they weren't scratches. Maybe a bull shark or gator attack. haha"
957394,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-12 16:54:00,937,I caught this recently and was wondering what could've caused it.  A bigger pike or boat prop?  Pike is about 33-35inches     
957401,captpierre,2016-02-12 17:50:00,2521,"If it was boating season, I'd say a prop. The cuts look fairly fresh so likely a bigger pike."
957402,farsider,2016-02-12 17:53:00,456,Anglers mishandling it?
957403,Roy,2016-02-12 17:58:00,13728,40 HP Yamaha.... a four stroke I'd say. I could be wrong.
957404,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-12 18:12:00,937,Majority of boats have been put away this winter in lake ontario
957409,BITEME,2016-02-12 18:39:00,1968,Another pike maybe even a muskie
957426,fishing n autograph,2016-02-12 20:22:00,2540,Ogopogo or Champ?
957427,Raf,2016-02-12 20:26:00,3495,osprey?

957497,KLINKER,2016-02-13 00:04:00,256,"Fish bite might leave a mark on the belly, I think your right osprey or eagle. It might have been too big for an osprey to handle."
957520,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 01:07:00,8243,A bigger fish but I like the Raptor theory too.
957522,manitoubass2,2016-02-13 01:13:00,11391,Those arent fish teeth marks id say talons imo

957657,NAW,2016-02-13 21:51:00,4022,Giant treble hook?
957658,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-13 22:06:00,8243,Especially when you see the single puncture wound. The longer wounds would be scrapes from closing the talons together. For sure.
