I caught one close to 19"".This is the first time this year I felt safe enough to take my truck out, and last year I didn't go out much other than callander bay. I've always done well at this spot but today was better than any other day in the past 4 or 5 years for me. ... I'm happy to reportI'm hoping to get on Nip several times before this season ends so I'll eventually post a couple reports with photosLame report over"

958240,NAW,2016-02-18 04:16:00,4022,Right on chad!  I may have to make an other drive up!!
958249,chris.brock,2016-02-18 05:58:00,4053,How much ice where you were Chad?  Sounds like a fun day.
958266,Rod Caster,2016-02-18 13:01:00,5784,"I'll guess 16 - 18. Elbow deep.   Anyone wanna go today with me? I'll provide the ride out. If work is slow, I'll be aiming to leave town around noon."
958297,Rod Caster,2016-02-18 17:04:00,5784,"Fine, I'm going by myself then"
958300,Acountdeleted,2016-02-18 17:24:00,2562,Dang it! Give me more notice bud.  it'd be good to see you again.
958313,Rod Caster,2016-02-18 18:21:00,5784,I'll be here tomorrow and Sunday too...
958405,ctdd2006,2016-02-19 06:32:00,531,Wow.  Unreal ice report and awesome fishing report...around here for the first time I can remember there are no trucks on any lakes and the most ever sled/atv recoveries ever.  Awesome for you guys.
958417,Rod Caster,2016-02-19 11:33:00,5784,I'm surprised that Algoma doesn't have similar conditions to us...  Nipissing is unusually well-suited for vehicles; the snow typically gets blown off quick and she freezes up quickly once you get some decent cold.
958546,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 03:55:00,5784,Best (or dam close) walleye fishing of my life today. Report tomorrow morning
