959034,mr blizzard,2016-02-23 02:52:00,1589,"I'm glad you are all enjoying the report!  And I sure hope the kids remember these little day trips. I know the 8 year old will. It's funny someone one mentioned earlier this this thread that at 3 years old, they will remember this trip. Because Sam and I had a bit of a conversation debating weather the youngsters will keep this in their memory for a life time?  I don't have to many memories of trips like this at the age of three. But I have punished my brain way to much in the last 15 years to have a healthy functioning memory!! With your math you are only 18, my son u have many years to recoup your memory lol"
959036,NAW,2016-02-23 02:59:00,4022,"Hahaha. No, I'm 32. But the brain punishment started when I was about 17! Approximately. I can't remember!"
958782,NAW,2016-02-22 00:27:00,4022,"I've wanted to get my family out on the ice all winter.  I had high hopes for family day weekend.  But it was just a little to cold to take (2x) 3 year olds, and a 8 year old.  This weekend, we tried to make the best of the warm weather, by making a massive snowman.  Then going ice fishing!!!  The snowman was the tallest I have ever made!  I needed a ladder to put the top 2 balls on.  And I had to cut some of them in to smaller pieces with a machete, then re-assemble them once they where in place.     A quick back ground.. My girlfriend and I rent the main floor of this house, and the upperlevel is rented by two girls.  After I built this epic snowman, I realized that is may have creeped out the poor girls in the upstairs apartment!  Peeping snowman!.        The fishing was great!  The ice conditions, not so much.  There was a solid 5"" everywhere.  Some places where 8"".  But it was a little wet.  I started out in 20' close to shore.   But we didn't mark anything.  So as I was pondering moving to the 30' range, what happens?  My 3 year old son jumps off his chair, and steps in a hole!!  He's soaked past his knee on his right leg.  And screaming his head off!!!         You can see me in one of the pictures, coming back from my SUV with a bag in my hand.  Which I used to put over his foot.  The little trooper didn't complain once.  After we got him calmed down, and everyone situated.  I took off to poke some holes and check the ice conditions further out.    Everything was OK, so we made the move out to 30'.  we set the hut up to get out of the wind.  This was the first time fishing with the entire family in the hut.  And it was GREAT!!  We where able to set up the chairs such that the kids could fish, with Sam's help, and I was sitting at their rod tips baiting hooks steady!     This is my view!     The schools of herring where coming through pretty good for an hour or two.  And we managed to catch our limit for 5 people in under 2 hours.  Tossed a few really small ones back.      The kids had an absolute blast!  And so did Sam and I! It sure is great to have extra hands for pulling gear in and out!       We had a great fish fry for dinner.  I have to admit.  I really love the taste of Simcoe herring.  Breaded and fried in oil.  As good, if not better than Crappie.  Still not as good as perch though....   And the kids loved it too!      This was the first time we have all gone out together, and actually had good fishing!  I think they are addicted now!"
