958957,davey buoy,2016-02-22 21:42:00,5505,"Where has Don been,another one mysteriously missing?"
958961,Rod Caster,2016-02-22 21:57:00,5784,"I believe it would, but obviously reading the policy or calling the provider would clarify"
959043,Sinker,2016-02-23 04:20:00,8692,Mine does. My vehicle is covered if i put it through the ice as well.  S.
771541,dhickey,2013-03-04 00:36:00,1038,So Ive had this conversation with a few people and seem to come up with different results?  Question. Do you have to have insurance to run a sled on the ice?  I say yes because lakes are generaly regarded as public property therfore it is no different than driving your car on a road? I have also talked to boaters that say they dont require insurance on a lake?  I can understand sled trails require insurance.  So back to the question. Do you have to have insurance to run a sled on the ice? 
771543,Terry,2013-03-04 00:43:00,14456,yes everywhere but private property
771544,Pigeontroller,2013-03-04 00:46:00,2793,Boats are not required to be insured.
771545,irishfield,2013-03-04 00:51:00,26272,.... which adds to the arguement that sleds shouldn't need to be or anything else on the ice.. it's just frozen water after all ! But try riding 50 feet without your helmut on and they'll be asking to see your insurance and ownership!
771549,BillM,2013-03-04 01:17:00,17367,"But sleds can and do ride on the roads, not very hard to figure out why insurance is required on them.  Try that with a boat!"
771551,spooner_jr,2013-03-04 01:20:00,193,"Boat licensing etc falls under the jurisdiction of the federal gov't, sleds fall under the provincial gov't, as does insurance, which is probably why you don't see a requirement for liability insurance on a boat."
771554,irishfield,2013-03-04 01:24:00,26272,My sleds have not seen a road in the last 8 years Bill. Unloaded at my dock on the ice and reloaded on the ice at my dock. Only time they get used. So as far as I'm concerned if you're on the lake it should be no different than a boat.... especially since our local OPP and CO considering drinking a beer in your hut no different than drinking a beer in your tent on the crown shoreline.  But that said.. yah Don.. you have to have insurance.
771558,chris.brock,2013-03-04 01:40:00,4053,"Who can issue tickets for insurance and liscencing of sleds/ ATVs, COs or the police, both?"
771559,BillM,2013-03-04 01:46:00,17367, Fairly certain only the Police...   I've never been asked by CO for proof of insurance for the sled/ATV.
771561,chris.brock,2013-03-04 01:52:00,4053," that's what I thought, but I also heard awhile back, that the COs were going to get the authority to check and ticket for insurance etc"
771562,BillM,2013-03-04 01:54:00,17367, It would make sense.
771586,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-04 02:48:00,10439,Here in Yellowknife you only need insurance if you ride inside the city limits. You also need plates for your sled to ride inside the city. Outside the city no insurance is required.
771630,wormdunker,2013-03-04 07:19:00,1711,"Yes insurance is required while operating an ATV on the ice.  Minimum requirement is liability.  Yes a CO can issue a fine for not having liabilty insurance.  I know this for a fact.  I was fined $145.00 for not having insurance by a CO three years ago.  Now I have smaretened up a bit, carry full insurance, liabilty, fire, theft, collison.  Fine was $145.00, Full insurance for a full year - $360.00."
958421,Rod Caster,2016-02-19 12:26:00,5784,"Warning: Old thread.  I got into this conversation the other day with someone; he swears up and down that if you are on a lake with a snowmobile, that you do not need insurance, just like a boat.  I would say otherwise, because who is expected to cover the lawsuit/damages when you hit a person or the sled sinks to the bottom. On the other hand, how come a boat doesn't need insurance when the same risks apply (enviro, property damage etc.)?  I'll call my insurance someday to see what they say.  Any new ideas from the community?"
958422,G.mech,2016-02-19 12:32:00,830,Insurance is required.  See tab 12 in this link:  https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90m44#BK13  It also states that CO's have the authority to check.  There is an exemption if the machine is being operated on the owner's private property.
958429,Sinker,2016-02-19 13:40:00,8692,"Yep, the only time you don't need insurance is to run on your own property.  S."
958451,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-19 15:40:00,10439,Only time you need insurance up here is when running in town. You need it to get your plates/stickers. 99.999% don't have insurance up here as they don't run in town.
958456,jimmer,2016-02-19 16:10:00,2730,"Insurance companies dictate everything we do, of course you would need insurance."
958457,Rod Caster,2016-02-19 16:15:00,5784,"Its somewhat of a valid question because boats don't need insurance, right.  Also, it's more so of a public interest to have everyone insured on public land because of the costs associated with injuries or damages; if someone isn't insured, they likely can't pay out of pocket for a sled recovery or property damage or potential lawsuits without first going bankrupt. That's my take anyway"
958458,DanD,2016-02-19 16:36:00,2223,"A courts judgement against you, is like taxes owed; they don't go away when you declare bankruptcy.  Dan."
958459,Rod Caster,2016-02-19 16:42:00,5784,"But someone still has to pay upfront to do the work/fix the damages rather than chasing someone forever. This is not a groundbreaking idea, it's why insurance exists in the first place"
958465,Sinker,2016-02-19 18:24:00,8692,"I think speed is the primary factor with snowmobiles requiring insurance. A lot of people are dead from going too fast on them, so I would think insurance claims are pretty common with snowmobilers. For what it costs me a month to insure mine, it is peace of mind at the very least. I think I only pay about $20/mo  S."
958487,jimmer,2016-02-19 20:45:00,2730,Just because you don't need boat insurance doesn't mean that you wouldn't be liable if you hit someone. Who do you use for $20/mth Sinker?
958539,Sinker,2016-02-20 03:08:00,8692,Caa
958955,Dara,2016-02-22 21:37:00,3052,Does liability insurance cover pulling it out of the drink if you go through the ice?
