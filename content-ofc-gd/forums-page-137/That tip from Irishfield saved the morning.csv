957989,misfish,2016-02-15 22:54:00,29133,I remember driving a propane van for a company. It always had problems. Got it. Thanks.
958090,wallyboss,2016-02-16 22:23:00,1095,Pouring hot water on vaporizer trick always did it for me.
958093,Terry,2016-02-16 22:31:00,14456,yeah but i needed the heater going to boil the water just saying
958139,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-17 09:25:00,8243,"That noise is me laughing. I like the idea of putting the tank behind the exhaust. From a vehicle I'm guessing.  When I did do the icefish thing, not too long ago, I always put a piece of Roxul in my bag. I put a chunk under the battery operated fishfinder on the ice. You could wrap a piece around the tank on the way out to I imagine. A nice size piece weighs nothing."
958170,jedimaster,2016-02-17 18:19:00,3472,I just keep the propane tank in my pants on the walk out.
958171,Terry,2016-02-17 18:33:00,14456,Is that a one pounder in your pants or are you just glad to be fishing
958182,jedimaster,2016-02-17 21:08:00,3472,No coincidence I met my last girlfriend while ice fishing.. haha
958185,misfish,2016-02-17 21:10:00,29133,"No coincidence I met my last girlfriend while ice fishing.. haha  Bet you fooled her. Then again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, LMAO"
958364,Mister G,2016-02-19 00:07:00,1429,And I couldn't find any ice to ice fish for the last week.............but I guess that's probably a constant problem down here in Florida......
958366,davey buoy,2016-02-19 00:12:00,5505,"Do the 20lb tanks ever get the same issues as the 1lbers freezing up ?,that would be one heck of a hole to dip that in to warm up."
958379,irishfield,2016-02-19 02:07:00,26272,"I've never had an issue with my 20 in -40, while the guys were scrambling with their 1's !"
958466,Sinker,2016-02-19 18:26:00,8692,"A 20lber is better for sure, but once they start getting low they ice up too. It doesn't have to be cold either. When I'm boiling sap, my tanks will freeze after about 2/3's of the way. Then I lift them up into the steam and they are fine again.  S."
958468,SirCranksalot,2016-02-19 18:31:00,3291,"yeah but i needed the heater going to boil the water just saying  At that point I'd say 'ah, piss on it'!!"
958485,Terry,2016-02-19 20:27:00,14456,lol
957793,misfish,2016-02-14 19:17:00,29133,"First time I have used the buddy heater in this -30 temp and only the pilot would light up. Turn to high and it would go out. Frustration set in after about 15 minutes of this, as I have not had an issue since I bought it.  Then an old post by icefisherman came to me like a lighten bolt.  Wayne had mentioned something about putting the bottle in the water to rise the temp of the propane.  Sure as hell, after about 10 minutes in the hole,I put the bottle on and I had that thing glowing red and in minutes, I was in a 90deg hub.   Thanks Wayne for that informative tip bud.  "
957797,cheaptackle,2016-02-14 19:26:00,849,That is so cool (pardon the pun)!  Great tip I never heard of nor would I have thought of it!  WTG for Wayne and Brian both!  Michael

957801,Terry,2016-02-14 19:33:00,14456,I was laughing too hard to get up and was too warm to get out of the hut to tell you  lol

957810,cheaptackle,2016-02-14 20:09:00,849,I'd charge him a lot more than that!       (good one Terry!)  Michael
957811,Fisherman,2016-02-14 20:09:00,7201,"Never heard of putting the tank in water but it makes sense, waters 0C, it was -37C here so that's a whole lot warmer.  In Manitoba I used to put the tank in the truck on the floor heat otherwise, nada."
957812,Rob,2016-02-14 20:10:00,467,That's what that cussin was all about?! I knew that too but I thought you was cussin about how cold it was! Mine did the same thing but mine is a 5lb tank but it is too big to fit in the hole. Just kept on clickin and it eventually lit. Good luck tomorrow Brian. Check ur PM.  Rob C

957821,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 21:08:00,8243,Another propane trick is to pour very hot water over the tank to see what the level is in the tank before you take it on the ice or the BBQ before you run out in the middle of cooking. You can clearly see the line where it is full to or you can feel where it's colder.
957840,irishfield,2016-02-14 23:02:00,26272,I'm here all week !!!
957842,GBW,2016-02-14 23:06:00,8460,"I never knew that trick till now.  Ernie, make a note for next time we have issues with heat...  HA!"
957849,mr blizzard,2016-02-14 23:40:00,1589,"another trick that works up here is make a couple of card board sleeves to fit around the tanks, do the base also, then they slide on and off  put them over room temp tanks, keeps the cold of them for a bit longer before they gel up  tried sliding a merino wool sock over then a slightly larger card board sleeve works pretty darn good  on the blue bottles and hang the full tanks , up inside your hut so the rising heat keeps the gas flowable when u need to screw on a new one"

957856,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-14 23:55:00,8243,"If I have to worry about my propane freezing I won't be going. That includes Qing outside 3 feet from the cottage. -27 here this morning my wife told me at 7AM, I took care of that easy. I slept until it hit -5.  I've been watching a marathon of Life Below Zero. I envy the strength those Artic fools have. I watch it so I can revel in the fact it's warm in here. That Sue Aitken is a freak of nature.  Brian, no fish report?"

I had no idea this could be a problem...but at least I now know the solution if I ever get brave. I will fish nasty conditions in the late fall, but come ice fishing season I am a ""fair"" weather kind of guy I guess"

I had two bottles on the floor of the truck getting warm before heading out this morning. Fired right up. I almost had to build a bridge to go over the mot outside.
