Bain & I make great time getting to Chris Brock's place, pick him up & head over for some breakfast @ Timmies. Hit the bait shop & then off to parts unknown, we were to meet up with Julian (sorry man don't know your OFC name) along the way.He was slightly delayed so we'd move ahead & he'd catch up later. Once on this lake it became clear that not many folks fish it, at least nowhere near the numbers other lakes in the area receive. There was a good 1.5-2``of water on top & about 8-10`of ice, mixture of white & clear. Julian catches up to us at our first holes & we move around to our next spot. Not a few minutes pass & Julian was on the board   Didn't know it at the time but this would be the biggest Laker of the day, nice fish. Anyway about 15min pass & Bain has one on the line, smaller but still puts him on the board.    His little guy was messed up, wrapped up in fishing line, a tear in his belly, he went back in better shape than he came up in. Now it's at this time that the tittle of this post gets it's name, Bain was feeling a little hungry so he pulls out a BANANA, I spot it & ask WTH is he doing bringing those blasted things on a fishing trip. Brock pipes in, Julian give him the thousand yard stare & it was also at this time the fish disappeared. The next 6+ hours we would put up with extremely light bites & lost fish. We dotted the landscape with holes.....BAIN!!!! Chris yells in his best Captain Kirk voice   Only after 6+ hours did I have any kind of luck, one laker took a good 2 minutes lightly playing with my bait before I set the hook home    Followed by a slightly bigger one a few minutes later, was really full of minnows not sure how'd he pack another one in    Chris would be cursing Bain's name all the way home. All in all though we had a amazing day among freinds & chalk up another OFC member that is a real pleasure to be around, Julian is a great guy.   "

959001,misfish,2016-02-22 23:37:00,29133,Nice report and look at the weather. PERFECT.
959011,sleepjigging,2016-02-23 01:18:00,207,Apparently banana can be used as a weapon. It causes bad luck on the water for everyone else. I have been able to avoid the skunk this year so far by having bananas every trip out. Not so lucky for my fishing buddies. Try it during your next fishing tournaments.
959012,Moosebunk,2016-02-23 01:23:00,3970,Add Brock to a days fishing and you've got instant fun.  Looks like a good time for all.
959017,manitoubass2,2016-02-23 01:35:00,11391,Ill take your word for it and cant wait to find out for myself!!!
959018,chris.brock,2016-02-23 01:40:00,4053,"If you come to the derby and pull out a banana, you'll be ingesting it in a different way."
959023,Jds63,2016-02-23 01:57:00,1365,"Hey guys it was a pleasure meeting you all. It was a great way to spend a Sunday on the ice / water. Trekking over the 3 inches of water all day I realized I need new boots, lol Hope we can get out again !"

959072,Rod Caster,2016-02-23 15:06:00,5784,Nice off-road boots in the one picture.  Someone needs to paint Chris' canoe bright yellow some day; watch his head explode.
