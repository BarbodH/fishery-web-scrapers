We are pretty new to backcountry camping so looking for some suggestions on potential campsites that are on good fishing lakes.  Would love to get into some splake and/or brook trout.  We are planning for mid July and will be canoeing in.  I tried using the parks ontario website to see availability and for some reason it gives you the checkin date option but doesnt give you a check out date, so it only counts as one night.  Is this normal or is it best to call them and book?  Kawarthas is an option as well, so feel free to recommend sites or lakes in Kawarthas.  Thanks"

958891,Oggie,2016-02-22 14:43:00,588,The general rule is the more portages you go over the better the fishing gets.  There aren't any lakes that are good fishing that you can just drive to IMO. You would be better off to enter the park from some access other than highway 60 as well.  The lakes in the corridor are pressured heavily. Just some food for thought.

958987,huzzsaba,2016-02-22 23:00:00,884,Thanks Chris.  I will talk to my friend and send you a pm.
959010,KraTToR,2016-02-23 00:43:00,506,"Check out Massassauga. All the sites are water access only and little to no portaging, depending on what access point you use."
959039,huzzsaba,2016-02-23 03:52:00,884,thanks for the suggestions so far.  Looking forward to trying out backcountry for the first time.
