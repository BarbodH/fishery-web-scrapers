958865,Fishwilly,2016-02-22 12:17:00,206,"Tried fishing the flow on east side of Cobourg Creek at the beach but this didn't last long as the owner that built the mansion there called the cops on us and according to the police officer the municipality of Cobourg is enforcing this as the owner is claiming he owns the land right to the water's edge. We were respectful and kindly argued that he only owns to the high water mark but she (officer) wasn't having any of it. If we insisted on staying she'd have to arrest us, so we packed up and drove home."
958875,ckewley,2016-02-22 12:36:00,699,"I fish there quite often, hit the other side of the mouth & you'll have zero problems. The owner was nice once upon a time as he would let you chase fish across his property but guess too many folks have treated his property as a dump thus him being prickish."

958970,Freshtrax,2016-02-22 22:18:00,2215,i would have been arrested.

959047,Ron,2016-02-23 05:26:00,1683,"Yes, his deed shows ""to waters edge"". One of the very few in Ontario. As one of the above posters said, done some hip waders and stand in the water. It will irritate the ell out of him. So, why bother. Just stand on the west side of river and get no flack.  Cheers, Ron..."
959051,Fishwilly,2016-02-23 11:57:00,206,Thanks Ron. Yeah that's what I've been told by a few others.

I'm going to ask my boss how that wording applies in the real world next time I see him.  I rarely bother with creeks and rivers that are anywhere near private property. Too many people think looking at their house from the road is considered trespassing.  Also, no need to get confrontational about it, because all you're going to do is make a bad name for the rest of us. I wouldn't be surprised if garbage, etc. was the reason for the hostility. I've been to a few popular shore fishing areas near where I live and it makes me sick the stuff I see laying on the shore."
959099,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-23 18:31:00,10439,When ever I fished there it was always from the West side. Better access and no stress.
959549,Fishwilly,2016-02-25 12:14:00,206,True to her word the officer that was involved emailed me last night regarding this issue and says that she was still trying to get to the bottom of things. Will keep you posted.
