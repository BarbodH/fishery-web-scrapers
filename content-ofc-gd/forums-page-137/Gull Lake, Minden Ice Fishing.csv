958178,guastels,2016-02-17 20:56:00,22,"Hi everyone,  We recently purchased a cottage on Gull Lake near Rackety Falls.  I am not an avid ice fisherman and do not know Gull Lake at all.  I understand that there are Trout and Walleye in the lake and curious if anyone can recommend any general location fishing spots and lures to use.  I am on foot so something close would be appreciated.  Again if anyone has anything to share, thank you!"
958195,solopaddler,2016-02-17 22:06:00,8605,Chris Brock might be able to help. Side note but I spent my youth on Gull Lake. There's an A Frame cottage on the lake near the mouth of Rackety creek that my uncle and dad and built in 1976. Is that the one you bought? LOL!
958204,Joey,2016-02-17 22:53:00,9122,Paul's parent's had a cottage on Little Gull.  We used to fish right where the two met in the little bay there on Big gull and caught trout.  Hope that helps!
958248,chris.brock,2016-02-18 05:41:00,4053,"Small world. I know exactly where you are talking about Joey. Pretty steep climb on the return trip back to Little Gull.  The wallies are pretty scarce and not worth targeting. Walk out to 60 FOW, live minnow, see what happens.  PM me if you want more specifics."
