Simular is an understament IMO. It,s a mr.champ thats been tweeked with a red fin. IMO  Was one of the best lures used on simcoe for all types of fish.Both hard water and soft.  Not meant to be a rude post,just MO on this.  Like said, you can buy knock offs of these and tweek them any way you want."
958998,misfish,2016-02-22 23:25:00,29133, Are they the same company that makes anvils etc for Wiley Coyote??  Now thats funny.LOL

959276,Shloim,2016-02-24 12:13:00,515,"Ok so as it turns out, the one I used trolling in Jamaica was a dollar store knock off. I left it for my buddy and he lost it. We also had another heavy lure like it, an expensive one from Lunkerhunt and it wasn't nearly as good. I'd like to help out my Jamaican buddy, I'm willing to invest a few bucks in some lures but the shipping to Jamaica is crazy expensive. Therefore my other post asking if anyone is heading down for march break or otherwise..."
958795,Shloim,2016-02-22 01:26:00,515,  Trying to find something simiair....
958801,Rizzo,2016-02-22 01:33:00,4754,is that a swedish pimple? Big time guess...I don't use anything like that but remember something like that from years ago
958802,glen,2016-02-22 01:35:00,2641,Not quite a cast master.
958805,GbayGiant,2016-02-22 01:36:00,1780,champ  Mr champ
958813,adempsey,2016-02-22 01:54:00,1498,Looks like an Acme Kastmaster or Luhr Jensen Mr.Champ with a flipper on it.
958818,John Bacon,2016-02-22 02:03:00,3277,"is that a swedish pimple? Big time guess...I don't use anything like that but remember something like that from years ago  No, a Swedish Pimple is quite different.  A Mr Champ looks like that; but I think there are some other brands with the same shape."
958820,manitoubass2,2016-02-22 02:06:00,11391,"Earily similar to my fav ice fishing lure, the northland buckshot jig"
958825,Roy,2016-02-22 02:35:00,13728,It's a Kastmaster by Acme.
958831,OhioFisherman,2016-02-22 02:56:00,6623,http://www.acmetackle.com/kastmaster-fishing-lure.html  My guess would be the same as Roy's.
958833,Rod Caster,2016-02-22 03:13:00,5784,Looks similar to a Deadly Dick
958834,manitoubass2,2016-02-22 03:38:00,11391,7 kids bro ive got that trademarked?
958837,NAW,2016-02-22 03:48:00,4022,Cast master Macho minnow  There's a few brands and names that are nearly identical
958838,Roy,2016-02-22 03:52:00,13728,But mine is not a guess...  http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/21g-silver-paillette-slice-catfish-fish-lure-esca-kastmaster-lure-accessrios-8-5cm-Bait-sequins-with/131399_32233704001.html  Mr. Champ is very similar.
958842,smitty55,2016-02-22 04:18:00,928,"Whether Champ or Kastmaster or whatever, they are all essentially the same design, like a diagonal slab through a metal rod. Mr Champ has been around for ever. I actually had a 6oz brass one at one time way back. It will always continue to be effective, as will some of the other classics like Cleos, Pimples, Williams, Hopkins and Rapalas etc that have been around for a real long time and still work well.  A buddy of mine exclusively uses champs for greys and whities at his cottage in QC and he's there lots in the summer. Funny enough, he's touchy about his colors, at one time was ordering bulk by the dozen of a certain pattern before it was discontinued. Go figure.  Cheers"
958852,adempsey,2016-02-22 06:11:00,1498,I am pretty sure it's a Chinese knock-off.  Kastmasters are stamped with their name.  
958853,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-22 07:37:00,8243,If there is a lure out there I would bet there is a cheap knock off from China. It sure looks like a Mr. Champ but I haven't seen one in that pattern. I say a knock off.  Doe's that pink attractor look too big for that hook?
958861,Big Cliff,2016-02-22 11:43:00,6899,7 kids bro ive got that trademarked

If anyone clicked on link you provide, they will see the EXACT same lure as OP.  So castmaster Europe style. Online purchasers were from Belarus and Russia."
958902,manitoubass2,2016-02-22 16:19:00,11391,The northland tackle series has a jigging spoon with a similar tail and it still works good.  Not half as good as the buckshot spoon at aleast for me.  The tail does look abit redonkulous
