958868,bigugli,2016-02-22 12:26:00,6138,"This kind of crime used to get swept under the carpet when I was growing up. Kids would be blamed and the teacher quietly transferred. I'm just glad to hear that the police are catching up to some of these bad apples. We had a deviant teacher in our high school back in the 70's. Teacher had molested some of the girls in the hockey team for a few years. Got away with it until he molested a cops daughter. The police came down on the school like a ton of bricks in a rare show of force back then. They went straight up to his classroom, put him in cuffs, and paraded him out the school during lunch for all the students to see."
