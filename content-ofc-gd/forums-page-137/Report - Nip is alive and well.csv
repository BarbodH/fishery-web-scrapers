958721,Canuck2fan,2016-02-21 16:08:00,1444,"If you are going to bleed it, where do you do it? Back into the water, or in a cooler, or...?  I strictly shore fish, so if I am keeping a smallie it goes on a stringer and back into the water and bleeds out there. Disclaimer I only keep smallies from a quarry that is 100ft deep in parts so the water is always cool a few feet down. Never seen one with worms from there in over 40 yrs. The difference was amazing though once an uncle explained you have to kill it right away if you want to keep it. Never take one over a couple of lbs max either"
958737,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-21 17:57:00,8243,"If keeping a few always bleed them out in the water then put them on ice immediately. With the crazy price for a bag of ice we fill large soda bottles with water and freeze them the night before. Throw them in the live well or simply a cooler. Lay the fish under the frozen bottles. I use the same bottles all season, just throw them back in the freezer. Rinse them off before re freezing. They will stay frozen all day in the summer and even overnight if in a cooler."
958739,manitoubass2,2016-02-21 18:07:00,11391,We do this for camping too. Last longer than blocks of ice and its free and re usable
959016,Moosebunk,2016-02-23 01:31:00,3970,Don't think I remember EVER hearing or reading of fishing nearly that good on the Nip.  Especially over just a few hours.  Great catching!
959027,Joeytier,2016-02-23 02:02:00,3990,"Nipissing has been producing big time this year.  Average size is up across the board, numbers are great and I've seen pics of plenty of giants being caught."
959040,manitoubass2,2016-02-23 04:05:00,11391,So nip revived itself in the matter of of a year(or so)   ???  Wicked  Musta hit the sweetspot chad or what do ya figure?
959041,Joeytier,2016-02-23 04:09:00,3990,"It's always been a walleye factory.  The only people that don't think that are the ones that don't fish it.  The only real notable change seems to be the average size has increased across the board, which is great!"
959048,wormdunker,2016-02-23 06:17:00,1711,"When fishing walleye on Erie I cut the gills with a pair of side cutters (wire cutters), hook it on to a stringer, put it overboard & let it bleed out for about 10 minutes while you continue trolling.  When filleting them you will see they are as white as paper.  No blood!"
959053,Rod Caster,2016-02-23 12:27:00,5784,"Sweetspot...yes. We've always done well there, but nothing like the action this day.  In my opinion, completely unscientific but based on some knowledge and history of the lake, I'd say Nip has recovered a bit since it hit rock bottom, but in a couple more years you'll see even bigger gains. If the keep rates stay low, in 4 years this will be an absolute fish factory again. Nip just keeps trying and trying to recover...it just needed some breathing space, which I think the new MNR and FN rules are giving it.  We need to remember that Nip was never known as a size lake. It was always a numbers lake. I hear lots of people this year catching 10-20 a day, which if you compare to any other lake in the area, is a great day of fishing."
959057,Acountdeleted,2016-02-23 12:51:00,2562,So this is why there was no G2G this year eh? Worried Nick and I would clean the place out?
959076,fishnsled,2016-02-23 15:58:00,3520,That sure is an incredible day and time well spent with your Dad.  Congrats!
959079,AKRISONER,2016-02-23 16:12:00,5558,"unreal, you guys sure did better than my buddy who literally rented a hut for 2 days and caught 2 perch and one tiny walleye."
959169,chris.brock,2016-02-23 23:25:00,4053,"Damn, I'd be out there any chance I could get if I was you Chad.  Some guys take and fry the pectoral fins too."
959244,Rod Caster,2016-02-24 03:29:00,5784,"I was out there again today with a friend, only 27 walleye and 1 keeper"
959246,jedimaster,2016-02-24 03:35:00,3472,I just cut the cheeks out of all my walleye dab some crazy glue on and let them go... just kidding. awesome report
959255,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 03:55:00,11391,"Darn dood!!! Nice shooting, ya gotter dialed!"
959261,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-24 04:13:00,8243,"I only had to loose 1 nice stringer of fish once when I clipped the stringer to the tinny and kept trolling. The combination of trolling and the river current had to pull the wire loose. Never again. We once bought those new fangled stringers from the Sportsman show years back with the plastic locking clips and our 2 buddies went to show us their catch and we said nice stringer, all the clips opened and they lost some nice fish while trolling. I cried too because it was supposed to be supper. I will never troll with fish in the water again. I will bleed them out when putting all the tackle away for the ride back in. No more stringers for me. A good line through the gills for only a few minutes. That blood also makes fish moist."
959264,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 04:36:00,11391,"I never bleed fish out. Just a personal preference, never noticed a difference to be honest.  Most of the fresh water fish taste the same or earily similar.  Cook a crappie, a pike, a walleye, a sauger, a perch without breading etc and tell me which tastes better.  The only on with flavour, imo is crappie.  The rest need to be breaded and fried, seasoned to impart any flavour.(or souped/griÄºled)"
959267,Joeytier,2016-02-24 04:55:00,3990,Chad ruined my lake for me.  Thanks to this post Nip is gonna have hundreds of huts on it next year
959269,manitoubass2,2016-02-24 05:12:00,11391,No walleys on nip but in chads spot lol
959271,Dutch01,2016-02-24 05:46:00,1431,Next year? Why wait? I'm on my way up Friday!  
959281,Rod Caster,2016-02-24 12:57:00,5784,"Don't worry Joey, if Nip runs out of walleye, they'll stock it with splake."
958568,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 13:21:00,5784,"Me and my Dad had a ridiculously good day of fishing yesterday. In 3hrs we caught 53 walleye. Only a couple were under 14"", the biggest was 21"" and we actually managed to keep our limit of 2 each over 18.1"". It was a workout running around tending lines and changing minnows.  Tons of fun!          "
958570,NAW,2016-02-20 13:51:00,4022,Wicked!!  What part of the fish are those small chunks of meat?
958571,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 14:05:00,5784,Cheeks
958572,woodenboater,2016-02-20 14:14:00,2277,let's hope this is an uptrend for stocks overall.
958575,manitoubass2,2016-02-20 14:30:00,11391,Medallions!  Great fishimg man!  Beauty walleyes!
958578,Acountdeleted,2016-02-20 14:55:00,2562,"Wow! What a haul! Glad to hear the fishing was successful and that you were able to grab some keepers.  Those medallions look delicious!  Also, you have to teach me how you clean a fish. Those are some great fillets."
958581,esoxansteel,2016-02-20 15:29:00,1307,"Your cleaning skills are excellent, esp for saving those scrumptious cheeks, boneless all the way fillets as well"
958584,Consigliere,2016-02-20 15:37:00,121,Bleed the keepers as soon as you catch them by cutting their gills and you're fillets will be perfect white.  Nice day crazy action.
958586,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 16:02:00,5784,I take pride in my fish-cleaning skills. Waste as little as possible with nice presentation.  I'll try bleeding the keepers next time. I usually only do that with rainbow trout so why not apply that to ther species
958587,Steelheadphycho,2016-02-20 16:02:00,470,That's some GREAT eatin'!  Congrats!!  And it's good to hear they come from Nip!
958590,Joey,2016-02-20 16:25:00,9122,Fantastic!!!!  Paul and a friend of ours and myself used to joke that we should sell pickled pickerel cheeks in a jar     Love them cheeks!
958595,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 17:02:00,5784,"That's pretty funny, and actually not a bad idea at all to Pickle them. Imagine that on a cracker, dam!"
958600,solopaddler,2016-02-20 17:18:00,8605,"Wow, that's awesome. I haven't had a day on Nip through the ice like that in a long time!"
958617,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-20 18:55:00,8243,"What a great day on the ice, way to go guys, fantastic report, thank you for some good news finally out of Nip. It's about time that a good report of fish came from Nippising. The changes in the commercial fishery is one reason why I hope. It is only about one single day of fishing though. Let's all hope it's not a fluke and we can look forward to the day that they raise the keep numbers for the sake of the businesses up there. The outfitters up there need this badly. Man Nip is where I caught my first non panfish. The in laws had a wonderful place at Bear Creek. I was so green I used my brothers spinning outfit and it was left hand reel so I turned it upside down to reel with my right. That was until a kind fisherman showed me how to switch over the handle. I hope my in laws had a good chuckle watching me fish upside down."
958618,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 19:09:00,5784,"Surprisingly, the outfitters are doing very well this year. I assume because of the lack of ice down south.  I did very well on Wednesday and Thursday as well, so I'm thinking it wasn't a fluke... But that's all at the same location."
958619,NAW,2016-02-20 19:13:00,4022,I didn't think they would be that thick!!  I'm never going to pass by s cheek again in my life!
958637,Steelheadphycho,2016-02-20 20:56:00,470,No doubt! I used to think my old man was nuts for bothering with them.
958641,manitoubass2,2016-02-20 20:58:00,11391,Cheeks are the best part of a walleye!  How is this not common knowledge with experienced walleye anglers???  Mmmmm medalions???
958643,spincast,2016-02-20 21:36:00,3279,sweet day  . cool mobile fish hut you got there too in the first pic
958645,misfish,2016-02-20 21:42:00,29133,sweet day  . cool mobile fish hut you got there too in the first pic  Did that make you want to go out know? LOL  Nice feed and report.
958648,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 22:13:00,5784,"Yep! It's a five man hut, but the queen seat sucks for jigging haha"
958658,porkpie,2016-02-21 00:51:00,2521,"It's not a fluke.   We murdered them in the summer as well.  Quality is poor, and it took us many fish to boat some nice eaters.  But on the other side of the coin, triple headers where common.  If the fish can gain some ground size wise, and the natives can restrict their netting a little bit, Nippissing will be great once again!"
958664,Joeytier,2016-02-21 01:09:00,3990,"Nipissing is dead, Chad."
958665,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-21 01:11:00,8243,"If anyone has never cut out the cheeks do it. Cut to the bone about 3/4 of the way around and simply peel them of the skin with the blade of the knife.  Has anyone tried Walleye wings? That is the meat behind the head to just past the pec fins, more meat than a cheek too. Use a electric knife or as we have giant Walleye here on Erie I actually use a Sawsall to cut through the spine and you get a salmon type steak. There's lots of meat there. The pec fins are left on so you hold onto them like chicken wings to gnaw on the cheek type meat."
958700,Canuck2fan,2016-02-21 13:10:00,1444,"I take pride in my fish-cleaning skills. Waste as little as possible with nice presentation.  I'll try bleeding the keepers next time. I usually only do that with rainbow trout so why not apply that to ther species  EXACTLY.... For people who think small mouth from cool water taste muddy. Next time if you want to keep a 2lber for a meal. Kill it immediately, by bleeding it, if you are keeping it for the table. So the fish doesn't release acids from the stress of being in the live well or on the stringer that change the taste."
