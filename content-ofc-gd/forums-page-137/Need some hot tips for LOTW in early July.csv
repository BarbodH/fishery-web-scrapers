This is our first trip here and to say I'm a little overwhelmed with the size and the amount of structure this lake offers is a bit of an understatement. The main species we're after are walleye. I'm not looking for any secret spots, but my question is: Are there certain areas of the lake that produce trophy size walleye? I have the maps on order from Map Town that I will be studying pretty hard. Feel free to PM me if you want. Any information received will be kept confidential."
958606,manitoubass2,2016-02-20 18:05:00,11391,Youll have a blast!  Not hard to find great numbers and big eyes on LOTWs.  20-25 fow and toss jigs off the reefs in july.  Bring some other tackle cause its unreal good for bass muskie perch lakers etc
958608,porkpie,2016-02-20 18:08:00,2521,"Last time I passed through Kenora, we caught 20 inch pickerel and a bunch of nice smallmouths off of a marina dock.  I haven't fished the lake enough to give any advice, but I think you'll do just fine."
958609,manitoubass2,2016-02-20 18:10:00,11391,Yep its a fish factory. I dont think you can do anything wrong
958610,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-20 18:20:00,8243,"We are hopefully getting up there too this spring and can't wait. Overwhelming is an understatement with 69,000 miles of shoreline. Manitoubass2 is our OFC Secretary of the Interior up in LOTW's. Good luck and have a great trip."
958612,manitoubass2,2016-02-20 18:33:00,11391," But mainly fish the south and east sides.  Kenora is a great place to launch and dont let anyone tell you you have to travel far!  Bring your confidence baits with ya, kenora isnt known for great tackle shops although there are a few. The canadian tire is decent but its strongly geared towards musky fishing.  Bring lots of jigs(i prefer 3/8 oz) in black, blue or pink.  4 or 5"" white swimbaits are a must as well  And black/silver potbelly spinnerbaits and white/silver for bass and pike casting shoreline structure  Ill drive up for a coffee and a chat if your game"
958667,67ZL1,2016-02-21 01:28:00,51,"Thanks guys! I was thinking of trying south side on Conney Island? Looks like some good spots. I've been reading on Walleye Central guys head to the west side by Oak Island but on Canadian side? Also was told Big Narrows? Big Narrows looks like a 20 mile run from Kenora, but I'm wondering why run 20 miles if there's just as good of fishing within 10 miles of launch."
958673,manitoubass2,2016-02-21 02:47:00,11391,There is wicked walleye fishing 2 minutes from kenora lol
