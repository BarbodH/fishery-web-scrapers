958694,Big Cliff,2016-02-21 11:27:00,6899,I am hoping to get out on Simco (Beaverton area) one day this week and I was wondering about the ice conditions after all the rain and run off we had yesterday. I know there is plenty of water and slush on Sturgeon lake. Any updates especially on the Beaverton area would be appreciated.
958702,FloatnFly,2016-02-21 14:13:00,1640,"from i've read lots of wind, big pressure cracks opening up, shoreline ice is shot, ton of water on top"
958741,misfish,2016-02-21 18:53:00,29133,"Lots of sketchy ice out there everywhere. Where I was this morning, I drilled 3 holes for my set up. The one to the right had 7"" the one to the left 5 ft away, had 4.5"". That was on clear black ice,"
958766,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-21 23:04:00,8243,Just be careful Cliff. I would be waiting for open water season now. We don't want to read about you in the paper. Even Manitoubass2 went through the ice last month and his next door neighbour is Mr. and Mrs. Clause.
958767,Terry,2016-02-21 23:15:00,14456,i think it will freeze  and be fine closer to next weekend call the operator there  they would not send clients out if it wasnt safe
958769,davey buoy,2016-02-21 23:27:00,5505,"Yesterday on the west side,as Brian said 7"" one side of my hut 5' away 5.5"".,I have a 7'x7' inside space.We actually had drain whirl pools going with the heat on. Forgot to mention 2"" of water on the way out,3"" around 3pm on the way in.Crazy season for sure. Other then all our boots full of water first thing,great day to be out.Check for sure before you go."
958843,Sinker,2016-02-22 04:25:00,8692,"Over a foot in beaverton cliff. Your good to go.  I dont know why people feel they should add their opinion when it comes to ice conditions.  I was 5 miles out of port bolster on 11"" just the other day too.  S."
958856,wormdunker,2016-02-22 09:16:00,1711,"Hey Cliff - we were 3 km out off Beaverton last Thursday.  There was 11"" of solid ice where we fished.  I saw lottsa reports in the last 2 days & saw the pix where guys were riding their atvs, water splashing all around them!"
958857,Big Cliff,2016-02-22 10:28:00,6899,"Really appreciate the reports, thanks!"
958864,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-22 12:02:00,8243,"I just said be careful. I got a concussion when I slammed the back of my head on the ice when there was a few inches of water on the ""thick"" ice when I slipped. It's not always how thick the ice is, there are other conditions to be careful of, like water on the ice. At our age we aren't as sure footed as I at least once was. A thick skull helps."

Did the same thing myself last year, only takes a second and you don't even know it's happening, now I have a pair of ""ice"" boots with cleats and don't go on the ice without them."
958886,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-22 14:30:00,8243,"The wind knocked me down like a feather, it can happen that fast. Just like when you slipped on the wet floor in the store. The scary part was I drove home and didn't remember driving the next day."
958890,Oggie,2016-02-22 14:39:00,588,"I was out on the West side of Cooks Bay (Gilford area) yesterday.  6-7"" of really black ice with 1-3"" of water on top.  I wouldn't even try it without cleats of some sort.  The bite was brutal though but I hear it was better on the east side of the lake.  The cold night will tighten the water up and stop the toilet bowling that's going on everywhere."
958942,Thrilla,2016-02-22 20:37:00,164,"Port Bolster yesterday was all good, water on the shore in the morning gone in the afternoon.   "

Whitefish have been haunting my dreams but I haven't even been able to target them this year. If I got out once this year, even if I got skunked I'd have scratched the itch."

958980,Acountdeleted,2016-02-22 22:44:00,2562,Saturday name the time and the place. If only Sunday works I'll be there and take the flack from the missus on Monday.
