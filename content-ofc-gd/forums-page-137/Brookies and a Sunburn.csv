958845,Freshtrax,2016-02-22 04:51:00,2215,Long story short  lots of sunshine and not so many Brookies....just enough to keep us coming back for more.    some little fatties in this lake...it made me smile when one of them coughed up a  baby bass after he was unhooked.  lots of sun and a camp fire is a beauty way to beat the winter blues.        till next time...
958850,bobowski,2016-02-22 05:43:00,360,Nicely done. That looks like a great day.
958851,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-22 05:46:00,8243,"The day looks beautiful, and a few bonus Trout. Can it get any better in the middle of February, up here anyway?"
958863,ckewley,2016-02-22 11:50:00,699,Nice!!!! Bet the snowmobile made things easier this time
958870,bigugli,2016-02-22 12:29:00,6138,Looks like a great outing.
958872,NAW,2016-02-22 12:31:00,4022,I love sunny warm days on the ice!
958874,Rod Caster,2016-02-22 12:34:00,5784,Nothing beats a shoreline fire.
958880,can u fish,2016-02-22 13:09:00,326,Nice Brookies thanks for sharing.
958884,Joeytier,2016-02-22 13:53:00,3990,Nice going.  It was crazy warm down there this weekend must have felt like late March out there.
958965,chris.brock,2016-02-22 22:03:00,4053,Looks like a great trip. You did better than us. The sun felt awesome though.
958968,Freshtrax,2016-02-22 22:15:00,2215,It was destined for me not to join you guys.......when we arrived at the lake a few km's from the nearest road there was a guy fishing solo with a broken down machine. Actually he is a member on here jack-of-all-fish.   so i dropped the boys of and helped him get the busted sled out to the road.
958975,misfish,2016-02-22 22:24:00,29133,Pretty fish and lake. And kudos for helping the lone soul.
958986,ckewley,2016-02-22 23:00:00,699,Never a doubt you'd help out a fellow fisherman but good on you anyways man
958994,chris.brock,2016-02-22 23:19:00,4053,What make was the broken sled?
959000,Freshtrax,2016-02-22 23:35:00,2215,"Not Polaris ,    It was n older skido"
959013,sleepjigging,2016-02-23 01:27:00,207,Looks like an awesome trip.
