958191,bobowski,2016-02-17 21:53:00,360,16 inch perch from Virginia beach. That's a 2 litre bottle 
958201,Gallie,2016-02-17 22:51:00,1215,Nice perch!
958203,Joey,2016-02-17 22:52:00,9122,WOW
958205,HTHM,2016-02-17 23:20:00,4082,"That's not a perch, that is a wrong coloured small mouth."
958218,PUMP KNOWS,2016-02-18 01:11:00,937,2L bottle!?!?  Holly molly
958221,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-18 01:27:00,8243,"Wowa wee wa. I use a Coke bottle to show off my big Walleye, a Perch? Wow. I don't know what to say for the first time this year.  Now the nay sayers chime in until all DNA evidence is gathered. If you want to start a conspiracy post a pic of a record fish. So I ask what the W5 is? In parts of Europe that is a average Perch."
958224,bobowski,2016-02-18 02:02:00,360,Just for the record. I did not catch this. It was posted somewhere else. Just thought it was worthy of posting. I can't imagine seeing that hawg come up through the hole
958236,gaspumper,2016-02-18 03:32:00,393,It won't be an Ontario record because he fillet the fish.
958239,NAW,2016-02-18 04:13:00,4022,"I could see a 16"" perch being caught on Simcoe.  Assuming things aren't photoshopped.  Congrats to whomever caught it.  Must have been quite the suprise!  I've hoisted some in the 14"" range, and let me tell you, the happy dance is in full force!   I couldn't imagine yanking that hog up a 6"" hole!!"
958287,netminder,2016-02-18 15:32:00,514,The energizer battery behind the tape measure is about the right size for the perch I'm used to.
958289,AKRISONER,2016-02-18 16:01:00,5558,this is ridiculous
958291,Court R,2016-02-18 16:13:00,213,"That's a tank...my boy got a 16"" a few years back on Erie..  "
958302,Acountdeleted,2016-02-18 17:29:00,2562,I remember that pic. That thing looks like a smallmouth. I love it!
