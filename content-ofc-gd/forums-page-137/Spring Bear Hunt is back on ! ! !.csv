958504,Mister G,2016-02-19 22:37:00,1429,Never hunted bear but I'm glad to hear the Spring Bear Hunt is back for the many establishments it helps.
958506,John Bacon,2016-02-19 22:47:00,3277,"Good to hear.  Is it province wide; or, just in selected areas?"
958545,Rod Caster,2016-02-20 03:51:00,5784,"Even though I never got one, I thoroughly enjoyed last years spring/fall near hunt; this year I'm even more stoked for it. I couldn't be happier that it's available to me here. I'd be interested in knowing if it's still a pilot program or if it's finally back to normal"

959086,Dara,2016-02-23 17:04:00,3052,"I just can't get past the $25,000.00 fine or one year in jail for mistakenly shooting a sow with a cub. Especially when you can shoot a cow moose with a calf or a doe with twin fawns"

Especially when you can shoot a cow moose with a calf or a doe with twin fawns  That's in the fall when they are better prepared to survive on their own."
959111,Dara,2016-02-23 19:40:00,3052," That's in the fall when they are better prepared to survive on their own.  So as long as they are a bit better prepared we won't go to jail.  I know a cub won't survive and I don't agree with shooting momma, but I won't be hunting bear in the spring if i'm going to jail for mistakenly shooting a sow with a cub"

959117,Dara,2016-02-23 20:15:00,3052,I'm sorry but I can't take a year in jail as an LOL
959124,myot,2016-02-23 20:49:00,131,Dara that's the reason why baiting for bears is the best option. you get a chance to wait when the bear comes in get a good look at them and make a proper ethical decision on if you should shoot or not  Dan
959130,Dara,2016-02-23 21:02:00,3052,"Thats all good Dan, I still find it to be quite excessive punishment for such a mistake.  $500.00 fine, sure, but a year in jail? and $25,000.00..thats ridiculous.  Its like they are trying to appease the anti hunters"

959270,James77,2016-02-24 05:45:00,175,"I'm not an anti-hunter at all, I support people's right to hunt. What I disagree with is the spring hunt as mentioned if a sow is killed it is basically certain death for the cubs. I also don't really see the sport in baiting a bear and then shooting it. They make these bears out to be aggressive man killers who are extremely dangerous and people think it's cool to kill them but all is not what it seems: I'm glad they have implemented the steep fines for killing a mother bear."
959272,Joeytier,2016-02-24 07:24:00,3990,"If you think bear baiting is as simple as throwing out a bunch of scraps and then waiting for one to show up to blast it, you're pretty clueless.  Bear are very in tune with their environment, and consistently successful bear hunters are very skilled at what they do."
959282,Rod Caster,2016-02-24 13:10:00,5784,"I agree with the intent of the law regarding shooting sows, but I also agree with Dara that the fines are way too high. If that's what it takes to open up the season however (and pander to the stuffed animal crowd) then I'm ok with it."
959284,Dara,2016-02-24 13:23:00,3052,Thanks Rod Caster. Thats all I'm saying is the penalty is way too high to actually promote tourism...which is the point of opening the hunt again...MONEY
959285,Acountdeleted,2016-02-24 13:24:00,2562,"If you think bear baiting is as simple as throwing out a bunch of scraps and then waiting for one to show up to blast it, you're pretty clueless.

959290,Dara,2016-02-24 14:07:00,3052," So you mean, I can't just go to the dump and wait for one to show up?   Thats the best way, but you gotta do it at night"
959298,Rod Caster,2016-02-24 14:49:00,5784,And dip your shoes in bacon grease first.
959302,Sinker,2016-02-24 14:59:00,8692,"I think the fines listed are an absolute maximum. I don't think 25G or a year in jail would ever happen unless you were going around shooting sows on purpose, at night, from your truck window.  It is very hard to mistake a sow with cubs when your bear hunting. The technology we have these days is crazy. Set up a bait, put a couple trail cams on it, and you will know what is coming before you even hunt. If there is a sow with cubs, move on. Its pretty simple really. It would be very hard to kill a sow accidentally. Most hunters are pretty ethical people and only want to do whats right. The whole argument about killing sows with cubs is really the only leg the antis have to stand on, so that's the fight they fight.  S."
959315,glen,2016-02-24 15:58:00,2641,Cute animal big fine.  Ugly animal no fine.
959329,Joeytier,2016-02-24 17:21:00,3990,I'll take a bite if you do.

I am not sure what your point is about how dangerous bears are or aren't.  How aggressive are ducks, grouse, rabbits, deer, etc. towards humans?  Thay can all be legally hunted.  p.s. Bears have been known to kill people.  They are not always as timid as the one in the video.  She is taking a big chance; just because it worked out okay that time doesn't mean it will always end well."
