958212,Freshtrax,2016-02-18 00:54:00,2215,"I am hoping to redo the interior of my salmon boat this spring with 2 captains chairs and then bench seating down either side . Anywhere i am missing as far as places to buy? god they seem expensive at Bass pro, Cabalas and West marine. anyone have a hookup? or an old junk boat with some good seats?"
958230,John Bacon,2016-02-18 02:49:00,3277,I seem to remember seeing an ad for captains seats recently.  I think it was on Spoonpullers.
958232,Freshtrax,2016-02-18 03:14:00,2215,"i saw them, guy emailed me pics not what i was looking for.  thanks."

958269,HTHM,2016-02-18 13:19:00,4082,"I had seats recovered one time, and my experience was that the seams leaked and the seat held water. I would suggest  getting new, or very good used."
958274,davew3,2016-02-18 14:03:00,430,Try C.A.S. Marine in Ayr Ont.   Their website has an online parts guide.    I will be buying my new seat there soon as their supplier is MFG in the U.S.A.  Not China  Regards
