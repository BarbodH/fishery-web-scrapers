958759,PickerelHunter,2016-02-21 22:37:00,100,"Hi everyone.  A 1 week window opened up for my wife and myself to get out for a fishing trip.  It's been 2 years since our last trip due to our first addition to our family last year (in-law's will be watching the boy for the week to give us this opportunity).  Usually we take the canoe to the Nakina area and rough it for 10-14 days, but we are thinking of staying closer to home (Barrie) and sleeping on a bed rather than a sleeping pad in a tent.  I have fished the Gogama area extensively and want to try something else, and was intrigued by the Temiscaming area or even in to Southwestern Quebec as I have never been.  One lodge in particular stuck out to me in terms of what we are looking for (drive-in, remote, ability to access multiple remote lakes for day trips with canoe/motor boat).  Opimika Wilderness Camps and Cottages.  I haven't seen much in terms of info or reviews aside from their actual website and Facebook, and a couple quick posts in these forums, so was hoping to get some information from the board if anyone has been there or has heard about it.  Any info would be greatly appreciated, or even general comments on the fishing in the area or specific lodges that anyone has been to in the Temiscaming/Southwestern Quebec area.  Thanks"
958763,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-21 22:56:00,8243,A PM to Mike Borger might be an idea. Mike is the man when it comes to good info. on all areas especially lodges for great fishing in the Province for sure.  When in doubt ask Mike.
958793,Joeytier,2016-02-22 01:18:00,3990,"Opimika is a well run operation, but the area is almost exclusively small, limited access stocked trout lakes and fishing can for the most part be tough until you get to know the area.  I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for, but I live in Temiscaming and know the area quite well.  PM me with some more information on what you're interested in and I can hopefully point you in the right direction."
