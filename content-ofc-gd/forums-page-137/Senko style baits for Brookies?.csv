958684,Eazy,2016-02-21 05:15:00,260,"Hey, just curious if any fellow anglers have ever tried a smaller version of the senko style baits for Brookies? I hear surveys that have been done and revealed that trout do seem to readily eat these baits, so just figured that maybe a smaller version, like say 3"" or so would be an effective bait?"
958691,Freshtrax,2016-02-21 06:33:00,2215,Brookies are pretty dumb when  they are hungry.   But it wouldn't be my first choice of baits
958695,singingdog,2016-02-21 11:38:00,1047,"I have tried 3"" senkos for brookies and splake. They will hit them, but are tough to hook up because of their tendency to slash a lure. In the plastics department, I have had way more luck using small swimbaits."
958704,netminder,2016-02-21 14:35:00,514,"I've never tried, but I assume any fish that would take a worm would take one of these too. I would agree with singingdog here about tough hookups though."
958708,Eazy,2016-02-21 14:43:00,260,"Okay,thanks guys..yah, it wouldn't be my first choice either, but just figured sometimes something ""off the wall"" can work wonders!"
958712,huzzsaba,2016-02-21 15:04:00,884,"Haven't caught much trout, but I think small pink worms are the best."

959126,jimmer,2016-02-23 20:53:00,2730,I have had great luck for Lakers with senkos in the past.
