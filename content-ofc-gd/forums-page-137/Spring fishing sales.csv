Anyone see a deal on a loomis GLX or NRX or a St.Croix Elite  Its getting to be near impossible to find deals on high end equipment.  With the current exchange rate all the dealers at the show were hiding behind that... I did end up going to Fishing World this past weekend and I picked up an IMX flippin stick and a Calcutta D 200 at last years prices. They are one of the few dealers that maintain previous pricing on their old stock.  Not sure what they have left but its worth a look.  Also, Sail has all there GL2's on clearance - approx 50% off.  Not the quality youre looking for but the rods I saw were all marked down to $150."
958125,Old Ironmaker,2016-02-17 05:04:00,8243,"KraTTor, if I may ask what the Calcutta went for. I'm in the market for a good bait caster. If anyone here has one they want to unload PM me."

I have a $50 SAIL gift certificate that I'll be putting towards trying out some new line and a few odds and ends. I want to try and turn that $50 into $56.50 (I think they do a save the tax event, correct...?). I'd like to make it to the swap meets but I won't be in town for the one in Hamilton. I'll look up the dates for the one in Bowmanville but Trenton is too far to drive for a swap meet from the GTA (for me at least...)."

There were only a dozen of us so not required. Or maybe we can develop a secret hand shake for OFC members for the swap meet or if we meet someone in France or Istanbul, then we will know he or she is one of us in our secret society..........  Maybe ball caps are easier. If you pay for them I will sell. Of course with permission from the secret society, Art, Spiel et all."

But one guy wrote a book or two and they were also walleyecentral guys.  And just so ya know its real easy to make a sticker
957337,Garnet,2016-02-12 11:53:00,2056,Yes he will be at Trenton. And I guess you know they moved it to Batawa couple years ago.  I will go to Bowmanville in morning and if weather is good Batawa at noon. Will likely miss my Bellville buddy's as they will do opposite.

If I weren't going to be in Rio then, I'd be making the drive down there. I don't imagine that gift certificate would do me much good there though, and I'm definitely not taking any of the Kijiji numbnuts up on their offer of paying 75% of a gift card's value to offload it..."
