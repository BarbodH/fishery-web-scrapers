1002304,DRIFTER_016,2017-05-04 17:07:00,10439,Hopefully I'll have some open water on my lake to play in. Before then I need to get the boat ready and install my new electronics.
1002322,SuperDave,2017-05-04 21:46:00,204,Hopefully NY waters for bronzebacks if this rain ever stops and the lake clears up.
1002127,npt1,2017-05-02 01:00:00,220," It is Holiday Week End and fishing time. What are your plans ?? Fishing, or Relaxing, kicking back and watching NHL final's? It takes a lot of time to get the boat back into active duty, have you done any repairs to be ready? What have you not done that you should have? Spring is such a busy time eh?"
1002128,moxie,2017-05-02 01:15:00,1566,Haven't winterized my boat in 5 years so it's always ready to go. Weather cooperates I'll be hunting Crappie for another week before attention turns to Walleye.
1002130,Pigeontroller,2017-05-02 01:37:00,2793,"All new carpet and wood decks, and new transom in my boat! I'll enjoy some Spring Bass'n in NY that weekend I hope!"

1002138,DaveRoach,2017-05-02 03:00:00,202,"New boat gotta rig her up. Add trolling motor, console and bow sonar, install battery charger.  Hopefully on the water all weekend, some Kawartha lake."
1002139,limeyangler,2017-05-02 08:56:00,5204,"New boat gotta rig her up. Add trolling motor, console and bow sonar, install battery charger.  Hopefully on the water all weekend, some Kawartha lake.   same here, only the boat is a year old, gotta get her rigged with a new trolling motor, swap system to 24V from 12V, add some ram mounts for electronics etc...etc. Weather has been a factor or she would be on the water now hunting crappie. I'll probably end up working long weekend (my choice) but I can fish anytime easily and prefer to wait till its over most years and avoid the crowds by going out Tuesday morning."

1002181,captpierre,2017-05-02 21:34:00,2521,Going to spend more time watching where guys  are fishing for eyes on north Pigeon. I've never had much luck early season at my usual June/July spots. Anybody up at 6 am in a tinny should be local that knows what he's doing Me thinks.
1002187,huzzsaba,2017-05-02 22:40:00,884,"Camping at Balsam Lake.  Hopefully the rain lets up by then otherwise will have to resort to plan B, which I have no clue of at this point"
1002205,Moosebunk,2017-05-03 11:16:00,3970,Up in the air! But between two E.R. side gigs I bet the phone will ring a half dozen times with offers for work.  Otherwise... it's nice to be home and fishing.

Jimmer is going to have to disguise his boat   Capt...dont overlook upper buckhorn.  weve been catching so many incidental eyes that if we were trying wed be laying a beating on them.  Any time we use something that swims on a deeper weed edge looking for bass we are running into eyes.
1002232,JoshS,2017-05-03 18:58:00,729,Gonna fish for some pike to warm up for musky season. I look forward to this holy weekend all year. Maybe sneak some walleye or lakers in. Can't wait!

1002264,captpierre,2017-05-04 00:24:00,2521,Doing the same up here but maybe more pressure.
