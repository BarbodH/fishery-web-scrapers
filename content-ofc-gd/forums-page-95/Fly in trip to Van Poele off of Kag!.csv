1001938,Bwskram,2017-04-28 13:29:00,2,Has anyone fished this lake before? I'm going the first week in July looking for PIKE. Flying out of Northwest outfitters. Any feedback would be great. Thanks

It was the first week of July and the walleye were still migrating into the lake.  That may not be the case when you go, as ice out was quite late in 2014 - third week of May.  This year, it will be at first week of May  Don't know much about Van Poele itself though, sorry."
