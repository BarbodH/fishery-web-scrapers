If you happen to recognise these clowns, please make the call  On April 15th 2017 at approximately 8:00 pm, unknown suspects walking a black dog attended the fish food dispensary in the Hatchery at the Bluewater Anglers Club located at the Waterfront Park.  Surveillance footage shows a male approximately 30 years old wearing a black and white checkered jacket and light colored baseball cap.   He attempted to purchase fish food.  The dispenser didnâ€™t work so he took upon himself to damage another dispenser thus steeling food.  He then stole approximately 30-40 dollars in quarters.  The footage shows a thin female with long black hair tied in back wearing a black t-shirt and dark sweater.   The adult female is seen taking pictures with her cell phone of the adult male stealing the money.    Also in the footage, it shows what appears to be 2 female teenagers who assisted in stealing the change.  Please call 1-800-222-TIPS with any information you may have about this crime!   http://www.sarnialambtoncrimestoppers.org/18381/theft-at-bluewater-anglers-club-in-pt-edward/ "
