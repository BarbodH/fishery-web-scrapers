1001655,Big Cliff,2017-04-24 23:15:00,6899,Which part of the lake?
1001662,ecmilley,2017-04-25 01:56:00,2163,All parts even canals ar only 51
1001666,derekxl5,2017-04-25 02:53:00,7,"Pretty well the whole lake, went from the Bobcaygeon end, up halfway towards Fenlon Falls, then towards Goose Bay and then back."

Pretty well the whole lake, went from the Bobcaygeon end, up halfway towards Fenlon Falls, then towards Goose Bay and then back. Oh, I thought you said ""a quick tour"" LOL"

1001765,Big Cliff,2017-04-26 07:49:00,6899, Once the canals get up to that 58Â° mark they'll be on big time but we need some warm sunny days.
