Was thinking about trying Lake Erie for some perch... Port Rowan are or Dunnville isn't that far either. Any thoughts?  Thanks,  LTF"
1001664,BITEME,2017-04-25 02:25:00,1968,Lakers bows brown it's like bits and bites out in the lake right now close on too  Go out in the lake on a flat day or a little chop head toward niagar falls floresent  rapalas spoons even crank bait you'll slam fish 12 to 30 feet of water bobs your uncle    Best time of year for it launch at 50 point even better troll toward niagara The boat will be fine the skipper needs to watch  Cheers Peter
