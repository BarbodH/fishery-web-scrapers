1001381,dave524,2017-04-21 19:30:00,4508,"FWIW , years ago when I worked at Long Point Prov. Park, I used to catch big cats all summer right up till fall when I switched to duck hunting down off Hastings Ave.  It was surf type casting, wade out to the first bar, maybe 50 to 100 foot and chuck out your raw shrimp or cut bait with a sinker appropriate for the waves and come back put your rod in a holder and wait. Too early now as they are still in the rivers, but if anyone wants to try later, give me a shout. Good sized fish too, a few 20's and about 10 average."

Dave there is a war ragging and has been for a few years between the Hastings drive locals, the Ministry of Everything, the local municipality, Perch charter guys and those that lost their cottages in the big storm. They have come to blows outside of City Hall. What a mess. Go to the Simcoe Reformer and Google Hastings/Long Point. Property issues bring out the worst in people."

Heck , me and the 2 guys I fished with, parked and always had a fire and did a few hotdogs, we were quiet  but would often stay till past midnight, we fished where the old Big Creek Channel comes close to the lake near the end of Hastings , we were quiet though and no complaints. I want my Canada back    Yeah , I recall seeing the controversy on Stomp's forum a while back, that sucks bigtime if it is all no parking now."
