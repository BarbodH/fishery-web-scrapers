1001960,Big Cliff,2017-04-28 18:58:00,6899,"About a week ago I ordered some jigs from Bruce, I wanted them painted slightly different than the samples, and let him know what I was looking for:  7:00 am this morning his son Rob pulls up at my door to deliver my jigs, (turns out Rob was going fishing over in Bobcayegon this weekend so he thought he'd drop them off to save me the freight).  I was headed out the door to go to work so I just set the box on my coffee table.  I got home a few minutes ago and anxiously opened up the box; OMG they are fantastic! The colors are exactly what I was wanting, the quality is exceptional, I couldn't be more pleased!  Bruce, thank you again for the wonderful service and a lure I just know is going to put a ton of walleye in the boat!  Owe you one!  Big Cliff"
