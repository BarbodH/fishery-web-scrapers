1001793,moxie,2017-04-26 16:25:00,1566,Nelson welding. Located on Finley. Ive used him for some steel welds. Not sure if he does it but im sure he knows someone that does.

1001835,Sinker,2017-04-27 00:28:00,8692,"I know an amazing aluminum welding guy, but he is north of port hope, near garden hill. All he does is aluminum, and he has all the tools to do it right. If you want to go there, send me a PM and i will give you his contact.  My bet is he will suggest not welding it, but fabricate a piece to make a patch, seal, and rivet it on over the crack.  He has done some pretty amazing things for me with aluminum. Jobs other aluminum guys said couldnt be done.  S."

Highly recommend him."
