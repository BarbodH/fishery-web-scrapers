What I need, is a foundation guy and also a framer, is any one here on the board that is in that line OR willing to do the work in Eugenia?  I am just waiting for the Town to revue the HVAC report and once the do I really want to break ground ASAP as I have heard that they will be lifting the half load restriction tomorrow  Any help please and thank you in advance ,  Thank you, FLEX - John"
