1001463,limeyangler,2017-04-22 14:19:00,5204,Cool Brian....if it works....work it....your worth it! LOL...sorry to sound like a shampoo commercial!
1001560,Rattletrap2,2017-04-23 23:40:00,1652,Very Nice Mr. B! Both the fish and the time with your Son.
1001654,SirCranksalot,2017-04-24 23:00:00,3291,"Sounds like you have 'turned a corner' with your son, Brian.  For several years my oldest son would not speak to me. But, with a push from his wife, we started some 'fence mending' about 10 years ago. I'm really glad we did. He went thru a rough spot about 5 years ago and I was glad to be there to help. There's a real heartache when your own son or daughter won't speak to you.  I wish my son was a fisherman. It's a great way to spend some proverbial ""quality time""."
1001743,Rob,2017-04-26 00:33:00,467,Good to see you and your son getting out on the river Brian. Time can do many wonders when you take it. Good catch boys!  Will get you two out for some whites!  Rob

1001086,Meegs,2017-04-19 22:16:00,249,Nice brownies dude!  Love fishing with my dad!  And love fishing with my son.. guess I got the best of both worlds right now
1001087,spincast,2017-04-19 22:17:00,3279,"nice, man."
1001095,aplumma,2017-04-19 22:36:00,6896,Good deal it is never to late to mend fences.   Art
1001096,RickOnt,2017-04-19 22:39:00,669,"Hey B  Good on Ya  Always a great, memorable time out with the boys.  Doesn't matter how big or old they get they are always your  boy!!  Headed north in the morning  Cheers Rick"
1001097,ketchenany,2017-04-19 22:43:00,3229,"Hey B, there will be a lot more."
1001149,bigugli,2017-04-20 02:22:00,6138,Your best fishing buddies should always be your kids. Just say the magic words and my kids are there in an instant.
1001171,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 04:35:00,8243,"Good for you man. It is important to be close to your kids as much as possible. The older I got the smarter my father got. He will be 90 this Sunday and we went for a beer together this past Saturday (he put a 5 dollar bill on the table and said he will buy the beers that was funny). We unfortunately were never really close but time heals all wounds, that was then, now is now. None of my close friends can do that anymore because their Pops are all gone now and I can appreciate I still can."

1001176,DanD,2017-04-20 10:43:00,2223,"X2 Cliff.  As busy as life is for my son, working at GM corporate as an engineer; we still get away for a week fishing up North. That week just flies by; him an I out on the water, gabbing about anything and everything; catching a fish is just a bonus. He and his wife announced a little while back, that I'm going to be a grandpa soon! So if all goes well, there will be three of us in the boat; in a few years.  Dan."
1001242,mr blizzard,2017-04-20 17:06:00,1589,Thanks for posting  Brian  a heart warming storey   Gives me hope  four years I have been my son to spend a couple hours to do a bit of fishing hunting sledding etc. and he lives with us   Kinda hurts a whole lot. If any son still has a father but ignores him over something stupid from the past  and you know he loves you pick up the phone and call him or better get together. Rejection is very painful. Rebonding rejuvenates the soul I am so happy for you and your son Brian
1001244,Headhunter,2017-04-20 17:09:00,5703,Nice Brian. I know this means a lot to you and I am very happy for you both. HH
1001245,misfish,2017-04-20 17:10:00,29133,"Thanks fellas.  It,s a slow process, and we both know it,s a hill that we can climb together. He has lots of support, so I see no reason this will be a not for nothing rebonding.   Hey B, there will be a lot more.  Albert  You would not believe the amount of spots we have been talking about fishing. Turns out we both know many of our spots. Cant wait for the fall run this year. Yes, I am already counting on it.  I have to say though, this kid knows how to handle a pin. Hell, better then I. I was amazed."
1001258,manitoubass2,2017-04-20 17:47:00,11391,"???  Good stuff B.  Best wishes, awesome fishes"
1001260,OhioFisherman,2017-04-20 17:52:00,6623,Enjoy it Brian! I got sick just when my son was reaching an age I felt was safe for him to involved in some real adventures!

1001286,Mister G,2017-04-20 21:58:00,1429,"Maybe tell him pics are better without cancer sticks, and maybe he'll think twice about them . ."
1001287,Rustic-Fisher,2017-04-20 22:03:00,826,Thats great Brian !!!!! and sweet Brownies.
1001289,crappieperchhunter,2017-04-20 22:07:00,2582,Forgive and forget. Very easy to say....not so easy for most of us to do.  Happy for you Brian and wishing you many more fishing trips with your son.
1001354,Sinker,2017-04-21 13:04:00,8692,Those are fish whistles.....work like a charm!  Beauty brownies Bri!! Looks like the young lad schooled ya....haha  S.
1001358,misfish,2017-04-21 13:25:00,29133,"If that's the only bad habit he has Mr. then I am ok with it, but thanks for caring.    Thanks again fellas."
1001359,misfish,2017-04-21 13:31:00,29133,"Also to add, these browns are C&R for us. Nice to catch, and nice to see swim away. Since we have been getting drop backs, we are now done with this area. Like to see them get back to the big waters and get ready for the fall run."
1001456,Moosebunk,2017-04-22 13:56:00,3970,Great to see Brian! Hope it continues for you.
