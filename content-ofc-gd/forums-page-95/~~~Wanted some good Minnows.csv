1001759,Acountdeleted,2017-04-26 02:31:00,2562,Could have gotten away with saying emerald shiner = 1. Golden shiner or common shiner is 2.  also great for pike and larger fish.
1001781,dave524,2017-04-26 13:40:00,4508,"I've encountered Spottail Shiners as commercial bait minnows, found Perch can't tell the difference between them and Emeralds, Walleyes I found are not as selective about what kind of minnows you use, Perch can be finicky. Heinz 57 varieties from beaverpond traps seemed to work fine for Walleyes."

One guy even had a slip float setup to get em for his forage fish collection for College. Such a cool idea.  I find commons and goldens are super versatile for all sorts of fish. On Quinte over the summer, my buddy and I will tie a 4-6 incher on to a egg sinker with a circle hook, toss it as far into the bay as we can, sit on the dock with a few beers and watch the bass, pike and sheephead hammer em."

Besides common shiners you also have these?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_shiner  A size 12 hook with the barb flattened and a maggot or tiny piece of worm will catch them."

Our DNR shows both here and in Lake Erie, so I assume they could be anywhere down flow? Around 10-15 miles south of me is the great divide between the drainage systems for the great lakes and Mississippi, for me it seems weird to see streams and rivers heading south."
1001864,Garfisher,2017-04-27 13:57:00,229,"We do have Striped Shiners in Ontario, they are mainly a SW species (SW of a line between Lake Ontario across to the Bruce Peninsula) although they have been introduced elsewhere. Where they are found they are very common, and aside from a few small differences are virtually identical to Commons"

1001875,MJIG,2017-04-27 16:20:00,227,Come to think of it last year I was fishing for walleye one night after work and one of the walleye spat up a stickleback. Maybe those little guys aren't such a bad walleye bait!  For your reading enjoyment: http://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/2009/04/10/stickleblog-spines-hurt-according-to-predators/
1001880,Acountdeleted,2017-04-27 17:37:00,2562,Thanks garfisher. A few of my co-workers mentioned Erie and St. Claire. Seems like you can find anything in those water bodies.
1001881,fish_fishburn,2017-04-27 18:18:00,1311,Northern Redbelly Dace are the best for walleye in the Ottawa River. They can live for hours on a jig. Just show a Shiner a hook and there dead. We trap our own in a marsh early in the season.
1001882,manitoubass2,2017-04-27 18:35:00,11391,"Funny how that works. Nothing will beat a shiner, frozen dead or alive in NW ontario"
1001885,Acountdeleted,2017-04-27 19:19:00,2562,"It's interesting, when I used to work in NW Ontario I looooved using Dace as bait. Dunno that I ever had a emerald up there though to compare."
1001886,manitoubass2,2017-04-27 19:51:00,11391," They indeed work, and live longer, but fish seem to favour shiners in my experience.  Can't even buy Dace in emo anymore, nobody wants them.  It's all shiners, worms and bloodsuckers.  I'd have to drive to the next town to get Dace."
1001897,Garfisher,2017-04-27 23:01:00,229," For your reading enjoyment: http://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/2009/04/10/stickleblog-spines-hurt-according-to-predators/ Neat little research there! I'm not too surprised by that haha. I know brookies love sticklebacks though, the fact that sticklebacks swim poorly may outweigh the fact that they can be quite painful/difficult to eat. I think the lake I fished didn't have too much in terms of forage, like two species of minnows and no perch (pumpkinseed though), I guess they could target stickleback out of necessity (or ease of capture)."
1001927,Joeytier,2017-04-28 07:56:00,3990,"Brookies definitely love sticklebacks, in many lakes they will make up a large part of their diet.  I absolutely smoked walleye on mud minnows a couple times this winter on Nipissing.  Definitely dont be afraid to try them.  We were catching 3-5 eyes per minnow too.  Wont see that with a shiner."
1001598,oldphart,2017-04-24 13:54:00,665,"~~~Bought some minnows from Gagnons, partner went there on Saturday, and got some, come Sunday, went to bait up and found they were Mud Minnows, and a hell of a lot of Sticklebacks. Perch would take them and spit them out faster then they took in. Should have waited and got my bait in Orillia,"
1001601,Sterling,2017-04-24 14:55:00,477,Always thought sticklebacks were an invasive species and not allowed as bait. Did some research and guess I'm wrong.  Pretty disappointing that a vendor would sell sticklebacks though.
1001602,Sinker,2017-04-24 15:15:00,8692,"Just catch them. Almost anywhere on simcoe right now you can catch tons with a net. I never buy bait.  Even better, get some Fin-S minnows. Never use real bait again.  I'm not sure where your going, but if I knew I could probably help you out better.  S."
1001607,dave524,2017-04-24 15:43:00,4508,"I've only encountered Sticklebacks when we used to set a minnow trap in a beaver pond on a small creek, we'd only keep them if we didn't get enough chub minnows. Thought most bait shops sold Emerald Shiners as minnows, Logperch were another undesirable  minnow we used to get sometimes."
1001616,OhioFisherman,2017-04-24 16:56:00,6623,"Mud Minnows? A regional name? are those fathead minnows?  It's hard to get emerald shiners too far away from Lake Erie here in Ohio, most bait stores away from Lake Erie sell fatheads, just my experience that they aren't worth buying.  If the bait stores along the lakefront are having trouble getting emerald shiners here they will sell fatheads."
1001627,Rattletrap2,2017-04-24 20:03:00,1652,"I have stocked both Emerald Shiners (Last fall) and fathead minnows (This past week) into my pond as feed for the Bass. Fatheads are preferred because they will breed constantly over the summer between water temps of 60 deg.F to 84 deg.F. Emeralds won't breed in the pond. I buy them by the gallon (approx. 90 dozen per gallon), so several thousand fish at a time. Fun to just watch the Bass bust in on a big school of minnows! Every day now, they are feeding more aggressively."

1001690,AKRISONER,2017-04-25 13:12:00,5558,I can't believe fish were so picky about their minnows  its surprising but i notice a huge difference between using emeralds vs chubs
1001693,manitoubass2,2017-04-25 13:46:00,11391,"Yep, night and day difference  Give me emeralds anyday over any minnow.  Then it's shiners"
1001698,Carp,2017-04-25 14:26:00,1488,We've always had the best luck with shiners. Not always available though.
1001701,shimano19,2017-04-25 15:45:00,196,"I think a lot of the bait shops around quinte sell mud minnows, the walleye and perch seem to love them over there!"

1001706,gaspumper,2017-04-25 17:54:00,393,A lot of bait shops sell these they are a dace minnow most people call them mud minnows 
1001707,Terry,2017-04-25 17:59:00,14456,In the shinningtree area I found the red side dace was the best minnow to use in the area. The other dace and types of minnows just did don't work as well

1001730,manitoubass2,2017-04-25 22:25:00,11391, Silver shiners are different colour
1001731,misfish,2017-04-25 22:36:00,29133,"Nope.  Silver shiners are different colour  Silver is silver, or do the ones up there look different then silver?  I,ll have to go get some to take a pic of ours here.  Here, silver is silver. LOL"
1001732,manitoubass2,2017-04-25 22:53:00,11391,"Lol. No up here emeralds have an orange hue to the belly, and silver is silver lol"
1001738,Garfisher,2017-04-25 23:59:00,229,"Terry I hope you are referring to ""Redside Dace"" as either Finescale, Northern Redbelly, or Northern Pearl Dace considering where Shining Tree is haha. And Manitou I'm guessing your ""Silver Shiners"" are something else? Only asking as using Redside Dace and Silver Shiner could net you MAJOR fines considering they're listed as Endangered and Threatened (respectively) lol"
1001742,manitoubass2,2017-04-26 00:29:00,11391," Turns out not all emeralds are the same colour(per say, shut up Brian lol).  But yeah, I've been fishing emeralds and some just have different hues.  The frozen ones I buy do say ""silver shiner"" but yeah, turns out their protected and not even in my area.  Im a dumbass  In retrospect, remember im the guy that caught a walleye that spit up a stickleback and I had no clue what it was ???"
1001748,Garfisher,2017-04-26 01:05:00,229,"Hahaha no problem. I figured you were referring to a different shiner, you are only over 1000km away from the closest Ontario population. Plus there's like 3-5 different shiners up there that can be silvery in colour Come to think of it last year I was fishing for walleye one night after work and one of the walleye spat up a stickleback. Maybe those little guys aren't such a bad walleye bait!"
