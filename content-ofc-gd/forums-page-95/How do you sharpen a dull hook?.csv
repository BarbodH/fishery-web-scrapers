1002018,GBW,2017-04-29 21:02:00,8460,How do you sharpen a dull hook? Me; I use a hockey skate stone. $2.50 and works better then the battery one's places sell.  Other way's and ideas please share.
1002020,kickingfrog,2017-04-29 21:13:00,8333,I've used files in the past and still have it on the boat to be used as needed. Now I've got this and like it.  http://www.basspro.com/Offshore-Angler-Diamond-Edge-Hook-Sharpening-Handle/product/10206824/  I have various stones for knife blades but never liked them as much for hooks.

1002032,smitty55,2017-04-30 02:11:00,928,"Im guilty of never sharpening hooks lol. Wow, that I never would have figured that Rick. It is absolutely the easiest and best way to increase your hookup percentage, other things being equal. Even having my bullhead handline hooks sticky sharp makes a difference.  Cheers"
