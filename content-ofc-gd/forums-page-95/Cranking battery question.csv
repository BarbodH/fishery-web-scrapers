1001921,b_cdot,2017-04-28 03:01:00,270,definitely going to look into 1000cca agm . I currently have an 800cca.
1001336,b_cdot,2017-04-21 03:20:00,270,I'm going on year 6 with my cranking battery. Graph has been showing 12.2-12.3 volts with graphs running and livewell. Checked cell levels and notice all 6 were a bit low so I topped them up with STERILE water not DISTILLED. Didn't realise there was much difference until afterwards. I was told by a battery company that bottled drinking water is safe. I had a hard time believing that. My question is will sterile water harm my battery cells? And another question. Will I notice an increase in voltage after topping them up and giving them a charge? Thanks for any help. I'm trying to understand batteries so I can take better care of them in the future.
1001341,Garnet,2017-04-21 10:59:00,2056,My experience with battery's when they start using water they are on the way out.
1001350,NANUK,2017-04-21 12:36:00,797,"Distilled water is better, I don't think you did much harm to the battery by adding sterile water, Anything after 6 years is a bonus for a lead acid battery, The cranking battery in my boat is also 6 years old and still tests fine, but I am replacing it regardless,"
1001439,b_cdot,2017-04-22 03:26:00,270,"Thanks for the replies fellas. What is your opinion about buying a deep cycle battery for cranking and running big graphs and also running live well and recirculators often? Is it a good idea? Im sure there is 100 threads on this question already. Any opinions, experiences?"

Im sure there is 100 threads on this question already. Any opinions, experiences?  What size motor do you have?  If you are trying to start a big 250 hp motor, then a deep cycle may not be able to supply the amps required.  Smaller motors should be fine with a deep cycle."

1001443,porkpie,2017-04-22 09:13:00,2521,"Costco has a good size deep cycle/ starting battery.  I'm going to pick one up this week, I just added a second graph and I don't trust the starting battery to run the whole show.  might be worth a look to see if it will work with your outboard.  I've only got a 50 so it'll be no problem."

You may want to consider a two battery setup; one for the main motor and one for all of your accessories.  I think there are isolaters that will allow your main motor to charge both batteries but prevent your accessories from draining your starting battery."
1001471,BassMan11,2017-04-22 15:39:00,583,I just went through this delemma. Basically as stated above if you have the room for two batteries ( 1starting 1 deep cycle for your master panel) that is the ideal setup. I did not have the room so I went with a dual purpose AGM battery with 800mca and 75ah (@20amp draw) because I could only fit a group size 24 battery in the compartment.  If you do decide to go dual purpose and have the room grab a Kirkland  group size 27 dual purpose with 850mca and 120ah at Costco for $130.  I also found this site which is a good guideline to what CCA and MCA you need for your motor on the Deka battery site.  http://www.dekabatteries.com/assets/base/0406MarineApplicationslayout.pdf  Good luck.

If I did have the room for another battery I totally would consider it but I only have a compartment for one starting battery. Thanks for the advice and the link. Will be looking into this new battery likely this season. This is great forum thanks for all the input.

1001498,b_cdot,2017-04-23 11:23:00,270,Ive load tested it my cranker and it drops to 10.6 volts when i start it. Ill push it for some more trips but i will likely be replacing this year. Going to give my terminals a good cleaning today since i saw a bit of oxidization when i looked the other day
1001500,b_cdot,2017-04-23 11:27:00,270,Pls dont mention tows or paddling lol
1001512,NANUK,2017-04-23 17:19:00,797,"Equipment failure is not an option for me on the big water, or any water for that matter, specially in bad/rough weather. I will be replacing my 6 year old battery before I hit the water this year. I also carry good jumper cables in case I need a boost from my trolling motor battery or another boat. I have never needed the jumper cables for my battery but have helped a couple of boaters with dead batteries."

I've only got a 50 so it'll be no problem. I was in Costco in Mississauga this AM.  They have both the big group 27 deep cycle/cranking as well as group 24 pure deep cycle.  The were around $110ish I think.  They also had group 24 AGM's for $159.  The CCA was 875 I think (more than the group 27) and 120 min res capacity (same as the deep/crank).  That might be a goodoption if you don't have space for the Group 27.  Price is good for AGM and they don't need water."
1001524,b_cdot,2017-04-23 19:05:00,270,I got a great gift for xmas this year. I got one of those power boost dealies. Compact booster pack. Great idea for the boat. Takes up no space
1001525,b_cdot,2017-04-23 19:06:00,270, Gonna definitely look into agm type batteries
1001558,NANUK,2017-04-23 23:14:00,797,That's a good deal on AGM ?
1001571,porkpie,2017-04-24 02:11:00,2521,"Thanks,  I'll take a look at the AGM's"
1001604,Sinker,2017-04-24 15:28:00,8692,I wouldn't trust that battery. It shouldn't drop that much.  S.
1001670,b_cdot,2017-04-25 04:13:00,270, Thanks. Im just going to get a new one. No reason to mess around
1001829,Mister G,2017-04-26 22:14:00,1429,"I do a lot of perch fishing and SLOW trolling for walleye with my TM so my main outboard doesn't run much...... I use a Group 24 deep cycle battery for starting and running a AM/FM radio, VHF radio, 2 Lowrance depth/GPS finders and a livewell on a timer that runs 30 seconds about every 3 minutes.  My outboard is a 115 E-TEC and so far no problems whatsoever after 2 years with this set up......battery is dealer supplied, I personally would of went with a Group 27 or Group 31 battery. I do have a onboard charger that keeps ALL my batteries in top condition whenever not fishing, like right now after 5 hours on the water today.........tomorrow they will be ready again for another day of perch picking. . . . . .  Now I have heard that Merc's need more power to start and don't charge as well as a E-TEC so you might want to take that into consideration."
1001901,b_cdot,2017-04-27 23:29:00,270,I have also been reading that some ppl have had problems using anything other than a cranking battery for their verados due to the ecm not recognizing the power source. (or something like that) LOL
1001911,NANUK,2017-04-28 00:54:00,797,Mercury Optimax 2.5 L - 3.0 L and Versdo 135 hp - 300 HP require 800 CCA - 1000 CCA Recommended 1000 CCA
1001914,irishfield,2017-04-28 01:44:00,26272,"Verado's are supposed to have a dedicated battery for the engine... another for the kicker and accessories. Has nothing to do with power to start, it's just making sure you don't wamp the computer with a run down battery. My 275 takes about 2 seconds to start after hitting the key and has never failed to start even fishing in -10C weather. My 1000cca AGM's are currently on season 10 and starting season 11. The only one that needs changing is the kickers, but I'll be doing them both and throwing the good one in my walk behind pallet truck before heading for camp.  Verado and kicker batteries NEVER on an onboard charger and boat is in the water 6.5 months per year."
