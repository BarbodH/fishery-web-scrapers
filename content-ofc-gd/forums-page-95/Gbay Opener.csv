1002048,bobowski,2017-04-30 15:37:00,360,I'm super pumped for Pike/Walleye opener on a Gbay tomorrow. I just wish the weather would co-operate a little more. I may have to change up my approach due to the rain we are supposed to get. What's your guys thoughts on fishing in the rain? I'm tempted to slow it down and use minnows instead of using lures and going for the reactionary bite. Either way it should be a good day.
1002052,kickingfrog,2017-04-30 16:12:00,8333,"I hope to get out this week as well, but not Monday. My feeling is that rain impacts anglers far more than it does lake walleye and pike."

I was out on opener last year in the pouring rain/snow in weather almost identical to this....the straight white 6 inch swimbait bite on the drop offs of shallow weedy bays was ridiculous for pike. I hit a couple spots where i landed 3 fish in 3 casts.  My retrieve was basically as slow as I could get the swimbait to still swim. I parked in the bay just near the drop off and cast out...let it come to bottom and swam them up the edge...was a riot.

The fish are wet, their meals are too?  Had some very good days bass fishing in the rain after a longish dry spell, and even a week of rain didn't stop the Walleyes from biting at PAB?  Rain will keep some at home, a good time to go!"

1002105,OhioFisherman,2017-05-01 18:55:00,6623, some of my best days of all time were in the rain.  Get out and catch some for me! LOL
1002113,AKRISONER,2017-05-01 19:16:00,5558," Get out and catch some for me! LOL  trust me ohio, if i could get some PAB fish to you I would. Shame you live down in ohio."
1002114,OhioFisherman,2017-05-01 19:37:00,6623," trust me ohio, if i could get some PAB fish to you I would. Shame you live down in ohio.  LOL, I don't need fish! just fishing would be good! I am aware of my limits though, so that is out. Nothing like releasing some fish and having a spam sandwich to celebrate!"
1002136,bobowski,2017-05-02 02:18:00,360,Went out today and endured the constant downpour for most of the day. Went to my usual spring spots but couldn't even get a bite. Tried a few different presentations. It's like the fish turned right off today. Water clarity wasn't very good because of all the rain we've had recently. It was still nice to get out.
