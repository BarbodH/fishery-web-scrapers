1001681,shimano19,2017-04-25 10:41:00,196,No it does not have i pilot installed. When you plug in the TM you hear it click as if it's powering up. It can be ran while in the stored or locked position. I'm not sure if they all do that but my terrora have to be deployed before any of the electronics would work.
1001683,Mister G,2017-04-25 10:55:00,1429,"My i-Pilot model will ""beep"" when plugged in......another thing is you should ALWAYS unplug a PD when charging  your batteries."
1001068,shimano19,2017-04-19 21:01:00,196,"I have 2 brand new 12v batteries for my minn kota v2, 68 lb thrust, after a full charge if i let the boat sit for a short period of time the battieries will drain. On the TM the battery meter will read full after a charge but over time it will drop charge even when not in use. Any ideas?"
1001071,aplumma,2017-04-19 21:15:00,6896,You have a load on the battery somewhere. You need to remove power consumers one at a time with an amp meter in line to see which circuit is draining the battery. Have the batteries load tested to make sure they hold a charge and that the charge is not just a surface charge. Any auto place should be able to provide this service if they sell batteries. Measuring voltage is not a good test for this type of trouble shooting.  Art
1001073,DanD,2017-04-19 21:19:00,2223,"The best would be to disconnect the battery positive connection(s)  to the devices they are powering and then connect an ammeter between the battery positive terminal and the cables that were just disconnected. That will tell you whether there is any parasitic draw on the battery. Any more then .025 amp draw will kill any battery or batteries in a few days. If you do find excessive draw, then one item at a time disconnect it from the battery; until you see the draw drop to well below the .025 amp or drop to zero draw. If there is no draw found, have both batteries tested independently; there is a small change that one of the batteries has an internal short and drawing both batteries down.  Dan."

1001083,shimano19,2017-04-19 22:06:00,196,I have 1 onboard charger and the trolling motor on those 2 batteries. I'll check it out. Maybe the tm being plugged in when not in use

1001101,Tom S,2017-04-19 23:13:00,362,Either figure out why they're drawing power (short?) or put in a battery disconnect switch to break the circuit at the end of the day.
1001103,John Bacon,2017-04-19 23:21:00,3277,If they are new return them.  If there is a current draw (which there probably is) then new batteries are not going to solve the problem.

1001185,DanD,2017-04-20 11:46:00,2223,"Okay I'll give this a shot, if the onboard charger or TM is drawing power what do you do. If the charger is the issue, there's not much you can do other then replace it. There is a chance an electronics repair shop could repair it; but you'd have to weight out the costs. Trolling motor's variable speed rheostat, may not be shutting down completely? Again replace or repair after comparing costs. Or do as Tom S suggested; install a battery switch.  Art. You had to mention Lucas ignition; those opti-spark joke of electronic module triggers; where a nightmare system to figure out. When you did get the system to actually make a spark; the guy in the next bay would spill his coffee and that was enough moisture to shut the car off again. LOL  Dan"
1001188,grimsbylander,2017-04-20 12:19:00,3016,I agree with testing the circuits to isolate the draw. I'd hate to haul back batteries only to have the issue repeat. FYI on the trolling motor...I always unplug my motor as soon as it's back on the trailer. More of a safety issue but it's good to not have it plugged in when charging the system. Not sure if that's really the case but it doesn't hurt to do it.

1001273,aplumma,2017-04-20 20:21:00,6896,Do you have 2 batteries in series 24 volt or two batteries parallel 12 volts? Is the charger made to charge two separate batteries or just one?  Here is a very good site that has pretty pictures on various hook ups ad why you do it.  http://www.batterytender.com/connecting-chargers   Art
1001274,Garnet,2017-04-20 20:42:00,2056,Your 1st Question Is it battery charger.  2nd Question is it battery.  That load tester talked about every boater should own 1 $50 CTC.  You shouldn't run anything else off trolling motor battery's.  Take load tester and test each battery. Even dis charged they should have 12 volts. 11 anything battery is junk. Brand new battery's are most likely to crap.  So leave load tester on battery and plug in charger should go over 13 volts. Not instantly but over 13. Do same to other battery.  So charger good now charge battery's fully and load test.  If your battery terminals are not shiny and cover white grease all this could be a waste of time. 1 bad connection and all this doesn't work.
1001279,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 21:29:00,8243,"I totally understand that John, I have learned batteries have a specific number of times that can discharge below 20% then won't take a charge. If under warranty return them, get fresh batteries and then troubleshoot the problem. I have bought new batteries that were faulty before installing, more than once. Batteries sold in the spring are most likely those that sat on a shelf all winter. Check the manufacture date before buying. The 2 Deep Cycle that I bought were bad were 2 years old. I should have explained my thinking."
