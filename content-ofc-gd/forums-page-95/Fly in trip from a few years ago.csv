We we to Sandy Beach Lodge near Red Lake Ontario. We flew from Toronto to Thunder Bay, from there to Red Lake and then float plane to Trout Lake Sandy Beach lodge. The trip got delayed two weeks because the ice still hadn't melted yet.    After a short delay in the morning because of fog, we were on our way     Once we got there and our guide figured out the season was way behind, we caught walleye after walleye        Our guide was fantastic and made us a shore lunch everyday!       And where there is walleye, there is pike...      44"" pike    And with a little advise from our guide, we went out for some evening Lakers...    26.04 pound Laker!     This was truly a trip of a lifetime and I really hope one day I can take my son on a trip like this!"

1001877,Joeytier,2017-04-27 16:54:00,3990,Looks like an amazing place.  Did you stay at a lodge or did you bring a guide with you to an outpost?
1001879,jimmer,2017-04-27 17:14:00,2730,One of the lucky ones! Thanks for sharing.
1001931,lovetofish,2017-04-28 11:28:00,500,"We stayed at the lodge. We were really lucky with our guide too! One of the younger guides didn't show up, so we got the semi retired guide who had been fishing there for almost 40 years. I  am also proud to say that I was still able to teach him a few things too. We were having trouble finding fish at the beginning because the season was so far behind. I told him to find us shallower bays that get the morning sun, wasn't long before he had us on fish. The other thing was just having a buck tail and a minnow rigged for following pike and wearing polarized glasses. This Lake is a true walleye factory! One afternoon in full sunshine, we caught one after another for 4.5 hours straight. If my lure made it back to the boat without a fish, I was surprised. We had trouble catching our one walleye under 19"". They were all 21-24"""
1001937,Rizzo,2017-04-28 13:19:00,4754,Great story. Never done a fly-in...and since I have 4 boys who would all want to come along not sure it will ever be in the cards. You certainly make it look appealing though
1002287,LittleWorm,2017-05-04 04:37:00,122,Excellent pics. I'm so jealous!!
