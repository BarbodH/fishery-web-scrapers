1001988,chris.brock,2017-04-29 00:36:00,4053,"Only a fraction of the water comes out the pee hole, most of the water exits through the port on the back of the shaft and the exhaust.  If there's steam coming out of the pee hole = too hot for sure. Instead of using the temp of the pee hole water, a better way to check that the cooling system is working is you should be able to touch the cylinder head for a couple seconds without burning your hand."
1001989,Freshtrax,2017-04-29 00:38:00,2215,That's the way I was taught.
1002005,Rizzo,2017-04-29 15:14:00,4754,I will do that...as soon as I figure out what the cylinder head looks like
1002006,OhioFisherman,2017-04-29 15:43:00,6623,"I could be wrong, but I assume the spark plugs screw into the cylinder head? It probably has a water jacket surrounding it too."
1001755,Rizzo,2017-04-26 02:20:00,4754,"After buying an outboard on Kijiji, I got real discouraged when it ran very poorly when I got it home (why it didn't get tested at seller is a long story). By poorly, I mean it didn't run at all. I posted here...got lots of great advice...but when nothing was working I was in over my head. Well what do you know Freshtrax sent me a pm and offered to come over and get it running for me! Well that motor was pretty stubborn, but he did manage to get it going after a bit of sweat and contemplation. Now she is purring like a kitten. Starts on first pull and my wife isn't giving me the gears for dropping $$$ on a piece o crapola engine. Thanks Freshtrax, you really know your stuff!"
1001758,DRIFTER_016,2017-04-26 02:30:00,10439,"So, what was the issue?"
1001761,Rizzo,2017-04-26 02:36:00,4754,"One of the issues was the gas can the guy gave me had more water in it than gas apparently. But I think there was more wrong, because even if it was watery gas, you would still get wet spark plugs after half an hour of pulling. The plugs were dry even after repeated pulls"
1001762,Freshtrax,2017-04-26 02:54:00,2215,No problem a quick carb clean x2  (another long story)  and some fresh gas will do wonders. Glad it worked out to be cheap n easy.

1001772,spincast,2017-04-26 11:31:00,3279,Good on ya Freshtrax.
1001778,Loonietoon,2017-04-26 12:49:00,1450,Great on you Freshtrax.... Still some great people on this site
1001779,LeXXington,2017-04-26 13:01:00,1928,Freshtrax is a great guy!!
1001780,G.mech,2017-04-26 13:25:00,830,"Freshtrax for PM!!  Oh, oh I think this thread just turned Political...."
1001799,limeyangler,2017-04-26 16:56:00,5204,Good on ya Freshtrax.
1001800,GBW,2017-04-26 16:56:00,8460,It's great to see members still willing to help out
1001801,OhioFisherman,2017-04-26 17:11:00,6623,"Freshtrax for PM!!  Oh, oh I think this thread just turned Political....  Preventive Maintenance? Nice work!"
1001803,Weeds,2017-04-26 17:45:00,782,Well done!
1001811,huzzsaba,2017-04-26 19:40:00,884,two thumbs up for Andrew!  great guy and knows his stuff!!
1001815,Rizzo,2017-04-26 20:06:00,4754,knows his stuff indeed. Saved me from the wrath of my wife as well for buying faulty motor
1001816,misfish,2017-04-26 20:15:00,29133,Well done Andrew.
1001832,chris.brock,2017-04-27 00:09:00,4053," good man Andrew, nice story  just curious, what's the deal with the water circulation?"
1001842,Rizzo,2017-04-27 00:57:00,4754,"So it does eventually start peeing out...I suppose maybe there is a thermostat in there. Having said that, it doesn't come out in a real nice stream...more of an intermittent spray. The plan is to replace that as a preventative measure"
1001843,Fisherman,2017-04-27 01:04:00,7201,Nice to see people that stop and help out others.
1001847,porkpie,2017-04-27 02:10:00,2521,"I'm glad you got some help, very nice gesture from Freshtrax.  Your impeller is probably on the way out.  Our Nissan 9.8 sprays hard right from startup."
1001926,Joeytier,2017-04-28 07:48:00,3990,"My 08 Merc 15 hp 2 stroke has always done that, and its had two impeller replacements since ive owned it.  It will pump hard when im at speed but at idle or trolling it will just sputter intermittently."
1001928,pics,2017-04-28 10:03:00,1268,Be sure to feel the temperature of the water coming out the pee hole. That will give you an indication of the engine temperature..
1001933,Rizzo,2017-04-28 11:55:00,4754,"I did do that...it was pretty hot. Not scalding or anything, but hot enough that made me think maybe it should be replaced. Then again, I'm not sure how hot it should be!"
1001972,Carp,2017-04-28 20:58:00,1488,"Great to hear you have it running. Freshtrax be da man.  There wouldn't be much water coming out of the pee hole at idle, especially when the engine is cold.  I had the same problem with an outboard a few years ago. Thought the impeller needed replacing because it just sputtered a tiny bit of water at idle or slow trolling speed. It just wasn't running fast enough to heat up the engine to keep a steady flow of water.  Pushed a smaller piece of hose inside the pee hole to basically reduce the diameter a bit. With the smaller outlet, it kept a steady flow from the pee hole even at idle. Engine never over heated and I had a sure tell tale sign that the cooling system was working right from start up. No issues.  I would caution anyone trying this though. You would have to make sure the back pressure isn't great enough to reduce the flow of water to a point that it doesn't cool the engine properly. Mine worked out great and I would do it again in the same circumstances. You must check the temperature of the pee hole water regularly until you're satisfied the cooling system works well. The outflow should be cool to warm, but never hot."
1001981,buick14,2017-04-28 22:16:00,741,Andrew good on you buddy ... top notch
