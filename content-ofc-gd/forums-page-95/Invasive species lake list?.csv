This year, for the first time ever there was a sign at the public boat launch of the lake that my parents have their cottage on warning of Round Goby and not to dump your bait bucket. My dad and I are wondering if that is because they got into the lake or if it is a preventative measure."
1001589,SylvanOwner,2017-04-24 13:05:00,266,"Jeremy, this is the one that I know of; http://www.invadingspecies.com/report/, for Ontario but there isn't a single comprehensive source that I'm aware of."
1001657,Jon,2017-04-25 00:46:00,209,"Here is a more direct link:  http://www.eddmaps.org/ontario/distribution/  Click on the ""Aquatic Animal"" icon, then Round Goby from the list. Zoomable/scrollable map should load.  Jon"
1001704,jimmer,2017-04-25 17:34:00,2730,If the lake is connected to a system that filters into the great lakes there is a chance you have gobies.  Closer to the Great Lakes the higher the chance of gobies..
1001714,AKRISONER,2017-04-25 19:23:00,5558,"id argue that the round goby although invasive has had a profound positive impact on game species in georgian bay.  Ive first hand witnessed the bass and walleye gorging on them specifically in the fall when bass are supposed to be out in the open flats chasing shiners, ive found schools of tank smallies in <2FOW in total feeding frenzies. I guess the concern is with the smaller competitor species of fish."
1001716,Acountdeleted,2017-04-25 19:49:00,2562,Closed off lake. Thank goodness. No recorded sightings according to the map. Looks like just a warning.
1001717,Jon,2017-04-25 19:49:00,209,Can't figure out how to post this without a Facebook link.  https://www.facebook.com/fisheriesqu/  Scroll down to the post on April 13 regarding Smallmouth and Largemouth diets in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence. 86% of SMB diets are gobies while 44% of LMB diets are gobies.
1001718,jimmer,2017-04-25 19:58:00,2730,"I believe one of the concerns with gobies is that they raid the nests of other fish, but yes, the bass have had a hay day with the explosion of gobies."
1001719,Acountdeleted,2017-04-25 20:04:00,2562,Anything in too high a quantity is usually never great. And that is correct. Gobies love the eggs of other fish.

That site has some cool videos! Gobies raiding a bed within 34 seconds of a bass pulled off it?
1001723,Acountdeleted,2017-04-25 21:04:00,2562,This is also why I'm huge against OOS bass fishing and why I feel bad whenever I nab one in May.
1001729,misfish,2017-04-25 21:55:00,29133,"The only way they are getting in that lake Jer, is from a bucket or an uncleaned boat ."
1001760,Acountdeleted,2017-04-26 02:32:00,2562,That's what they said about Asian carp in Lake Ontario.
1001773,Sterling,2017-04-26 11:46:00,477, That site has some cool videos! Gobies raiding a bed within 34 seconds of a bass pulled off it?  I'm watching all their videos. So cool. They have evidence showing that fish learn from being caught & released. That's hilarious!
1001777,fishindevil,2017-04-26 12:34:00,6254,some invasives can actually travel into new waters from birds and other means so brian its possible not only from a boat but from several other ways too
1001872,misfish,2017-04-27 15:54:00,29133,Yes you are correct. I failed to remember this. Thanks.
