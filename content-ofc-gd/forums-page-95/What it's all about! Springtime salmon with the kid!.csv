1000840,Meegs,2017-04-18 16:31:00,249,Haven't been out alot this year for my usual standards but I've made it out on the open water 4 times over the last 3 weeks. By far my favorite fishing of the year! No ice required for the cooler and the best eating fish going in my mind..  took my youngest boy out and man is he now hooked! I swear..  every night he asks if we can go fishing tomorrow!  Love it!  Reminds me of myself when I was his age!  Here's afew pictures from the past few trips!

1000852,dave524,2017-04-18 17:07:00,4508,"Nice springs, whitecaps out of the NE when I took the garbage out this morning though."
1000858,misfish,2017-04-18 17:16:00,29133,Nice buddy. Always fun when the young lads want to go too. Need to venture over for a load of new spoons before lakerfest.
1000860,Meegs,2017-04-18 17:19:00,249,"Nice springs, whitecaps out of the NE when I took the garbage out this morning though. All good..  I'll be fishing alot closer to home next time I get out... that 2 hour drive sucks!  Doubt I'll be back this year."
1000863,BillM,2017-04-18 17:21:00,17367,Love spring time salmon!
1000949,Moosebunk,2017-04-19 00:52:00,3970,"What it's all about is right brutha James!  Great fishing. But Holy Crap man, that's alotta traffic out there. Wow!  Way to get'er done."
1000960,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-19 02:15:00,937,Nice.  Now you'll have a fishing buddy for life
1000971,spincast,2017-04-19 10:07:00,3279,"nice way to start the season!.   Reminds me of G at that age. Now he's a teen he's still into the fishing, but those 4 am drives are a lot quieter."
1000979,limeyangler,2017-04-19 11:45:00,5204,"Love it, ice out can't come soon enough, my kid also gets a thrill being behind the wheel, he stands between my legs and i am  glad he is facing the other way because I have an embarrassingly stupid, proud grin all over my face."
1000983,GBW,2017-04-19 12:24:00,8460,"NICE GOING!   Love it, ice out can't come soon enough, my kid also gets a thrill being behind the wheel, he stands between my legs and i am  glad he is facing the other way because I have an embarrassingly stupid, proud grin all over my face. Naw, all us parents have that grin so don't feel ashamed"
1000995,BillM,2017-04-19 13:31:00,17367,"I still haven't hit salmon out there yet, although it's not for a lack of trying.  Always a day late from the reports"
1001384,jimmer,2017-04-21 20:04:00,2730,"That's quite the haul, no wonder your kid is hooked! Thanks for sharing!"
1001462,limeyangler,2017-04-22 14:17:00,5204,I had to come back and look at this post again....great job Dad!
1001501,Rizzo,2017-04-23 12:09:00,4754,"wow great fish and a great story...only negative is the amount of comapny out there. Sometimes I run lines 450 feet back, wouldnt trust it with that many out there"
1001555,Meegs,2017-04-23 23:02:00,249,I know a fellow that every year he tries to run a leadcore rod... every year within 2 hours of putting it out it gets run over!  It's a zoo on weekends always watching others.
1001557,misfish,2017-04-23 23:13:00,29133,"I know a fellow that every year he tries to run a leadcore rod... every year within 2 hours of putting it out it gets run over!

1001647,BillM,2017-04-24 22:13:00,17367,"KBay, is nothing like OS, that place is like controlled chaos, lol!"
1001650,misfish,2017-04-24 22:26:00,29133,"KBay, is nothing like OS, that place is like controlled chaos, lol!  Try fishing weekends Bill, Not weekdays. LOL"
1001653,Meegs,2017-04-24 22:50:00,249,Nope..  the I'll take the guys on any simcoe weekend.  The sound is easily 10x worse than the busiest day on simcoe.
1001656,porkpie,2017-04-25 00:09:00,2521,I know a fellow that every year he tries to run a leadcore rod... every year within 2 hours of putting it out it gets run over! It's a zoo on weekends always watching others.  I can't believe he even tries.  I had guys pass so close to me I swear I could've reached out and shaken hands with them in the sound.  Not the place for leadcore!  Looks like some good fishin!
1001697,Carp,2017-04-25 14:23:00,1488,Some great pictures.  My kids all love to fish too. I just haven't had much time lately to get on the water. Hopefully this year...........
