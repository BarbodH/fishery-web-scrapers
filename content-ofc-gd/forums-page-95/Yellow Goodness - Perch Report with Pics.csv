I'd say about half our catch was 11-12"" range and the pig of the day was a whopping 14"" fish  We finished up with 80 in the box between the 2 of us and both our families were pleased with a fresh feed for everyone  We were targeting shallow flats from 4-8 feet of water with slip floats and small plastics (that's right... NO BAIT lol)... the key was finding how shallow they had moved up the bank and then next was locating old weed growth  We were giggling like little kids we had so much fun  Thanks  Mike       "
