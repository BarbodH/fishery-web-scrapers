1001947,4x4bassin,2017-04-28 15:01:00,1025,From what I'm being told all backcountry permits are being issued as of today with some access roads being closed . The west side of the park still has some flooding and some snow issues on some access roads making them impassable . Advisories have been posted for this area of the park . Good luck all !!!
