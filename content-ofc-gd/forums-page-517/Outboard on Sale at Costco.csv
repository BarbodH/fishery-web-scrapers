I know, there'll be no parts to find, no one knows how to fix them, unproven brand etc. etc. etc., but it does have the Costco no-questions-asked warranty for at least 2 years.  This is also a 4 stroke motor.  Shouldn't be too hard to fix for any marine mechanic, outboard technology isn't rocket science.  For anyone looking for a motor for a cottage boat or a dinghy, this may be an option at probably half the price of a ""name"" brand black or blue outboard.  Hope someone finds this post useful."
599853,John Bacon,2011-07-06 04:52:00,3277,I was told by the APS rep at the Sportsman show a few year back the APS motors came out of the same factory as Mercury motors.  I believe that small Merc's and Nissans are made by Tohatsu.  If this is the case then you may be able to use Mercury parts.  I never did any research to confirm that what he told me was true; it is just what I was told.
