599981,Cosmos,2011-07-06 17:29:00,588,"Hi guys,  I am looking for spare gas tank for my boat. Following advise of one OFNer i gave a call to Sandy Cove Marine. They do have tanks in stock. Actually everything is 40% off. They said with proper fitting i should be fine. I have 9,9 HP Johnson 2000, i found this fitting:  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Marine/BoatPartsAccessories/PRD~0799026P/Johnson%25252BEvinrude%25252BOMC%252BTank%252BFitting.jsp?locale=en  My question is - if i will get that tank and will put this fitting would i need something else or i would be ready to go? I don't really understand the way that fitting should be installed. Is any kind of tube in that tank coming to the fitting to get the fuel from the bottom of the tank?  Thank you"

599992,Cosmos,2011-07-06 18:06:00,588,"  I don't mind to take it, but they said they don't have any fittings left."
599993,Spiel,2011-07-06 18:09:00,9065, I see.  Well the fitting you showed in the link is the same as the tank fitting I had for my 25 horse Johnson. I believe it's a standard fitting and once installed on the tank you should be good to go.  
599995,Cosmos,2011-07-06 18:12:00,588, Thank you for quick answer.  What is a way to install this fitting?
599999,Spiel,2011-07-06 18:21:00,9065,"It's threaded, not sure if a gas resistant sealant is needed?"
600002,Carp,2011-07-06 18:32:00,1488,"Buy the fitting at Canadian Tire and bring it with you to pick up the tank. Just show it to them and ask if it's the right one before opening the package. If it's wrong, you can always return it.  Good luck !"
600007,Cosmos,2011-07-06 18:46:00,588,"  Thanks, i will do this."
600038,Fisherman,2011-07-06 19:50:00,7201,"Yes that's the right fitting and there are instructions right on the side of the box that the tank comes in.  Take out the 4 screws that hold the part on the tank, screw in the Johnson fitting and then replace the assembly with the 4 screws.  Poof-done."
