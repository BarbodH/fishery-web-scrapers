600121,pikeslayerjr,2011-07-07 00:38:00,7,Cliff you got me a dog for the fall! That was so kind of you!  Lol jk..I'm looking forward to making friends with him/her when I get there in September... U wouldn't  mind if I took him /her for a walk around campus to meet some of the new girls around town would you? Muhahaha :-P
600122,mercman,2011-07-07 00:38:00,7054,  I know Cliff  But Geoff knows where its coming from....Right Geoff              Ya big Wussy....
600129,misfish,2011-07-07 00:49:00,29133,  Dirty dog you.
600135,Big Cliff,2011-07-07 01:06:00,6899," Well, I might need someone to puppy sit once in a while and I'm sure a nice walk would be good for socializing the puppy so maybe"
600139,GBW,2011-07-07 01:36:00,8460,"She does know, out 10+ year old 'pup' would say no  look what province he's in...  An older dog works well too.  WAIT!  your dad is going to read this and maybe your mom.  I said NOTHING!  yeah, from the French side of ONT!"
600161,mercman,2011-07-07 02:42:00,7054,  Pitcher la vache...Pitcher la vache!!!  did he just launch a cow from a cannon
600205,Jewelbee,2011-07-07 08:19:00,422, Yes... they DO take over your home...and your heart!
600214,Billy Bob,2011-07-07 10:37:00,5865,The wife and I are SERIOUSLY considering a dog once my son's wedding is over with.....but it has to be a chocolate lab named TUNDRA....Cliff already said to bring him/her up next year to play with their new loved beagle....  When I was in high school my buddy John and I would go duck hunting every Saturday we didn't have a football game to play (we played a lot of Friday night games)....I would pick him up in my sister's car and CAREFULLY and LIGHTLY knock on his door at 4am or even sooner....well John had 4 beagles and every time they would start HOWLING at 4am and wake up not only everyone in his house but several neighbors as well...GREAT MEMORIES...
600285,Beans,2011-07-07 14:45:00,3339,   A beagle G2G...Great idea !!!  We will just have to make sure Chiquita doesn't sit on any of the pups...    
600353,misfish,2011-07-07 20:17:00,29133,"Saddly I have to give up the pup. I should of contacted the condo cummity first before jumping on this great deal. It seem those of us with dogs now are ok,but a new rule was put into effect last fall that I was not aware of and no pets are allowed no longer in the complex.  So there is a male still up for adoption. Im not a very happy guy right now.Was really looking forward to this.  Sorry about this Cliff."
600364,motv8tr,2011-07-07 21:08:00,2587,"That's unfortunate Brian, in fact it pretty much sucks...would never own a place that can dictate what I can and cannot have in my home....I think Beans should get one of the pups to help exercise the girl he has now...'just sayn'  Maureen"
600367,Big Cliff,2011-07-07 21:16:00,6899, You trying to give my buddy Beans a heart attack kid? You know how they say dogs often look like their owners; well Chiquita is a perfect example of that  (sorry about that buddy but I owe you one or two LOL).
600376,motv8tr,2011-07-07 21:50:00,2587,"looked to me like it was his idea Cliff  ""I'm sure Chiquita would be half the weight she is if she had had a brother or sister to play with...""  Just Sayn'....  Maureen"
600379,Beans,2011-07-07 22:01:00,3339," The key words are ""if she had had"" Mo...(past tense)  If she hadn't of been Lee's dog...we would still be dogless..."
599497,Big Cliff,2011-07-05 10:15:00,6899,"Friends of ours have a litter of Beagle pups they are now just 7 weeks old and they are looking for good homes for them, there are now 5 left to choose from (we will be getting one later this week).  Let me know if you are interested."
599501,Billy Bob,2011-07-05 10:39:00,5865,"Cliff.....only one....I think you should get a pair to keep each other company during the day...or better yet get THREE..  I know I'm starting trouble.......  :devil: ...but if I can get Sue to read this, you're in TROUBLE....."
599510,Teressa,2011-07-05 11:33:00,55,"LOL I agree with Billy Bob about getting a 2nd pup Dad. At least if the little guy has a playmate, they can keep each other company."
599534,Beans,2011-07-05 13:15:00,3339,"CLIFF !!!...you getting demented in your old age ???  After meeting Chiquita at my place, why in the world would you choose a BEAGLE...?     Just kidding Mate...Two pups sounds like a great idea...  I'm sure Chiquita would be half the weight she is if she had had a brother or sister to play with...  Ki (our cat) just isn't interested..."
599570,Pikeslayer,2011-07-05 15:37:00,1443,"And here I thought you were offering up yourself to a good home??  Yep, why not take two? Double the fun, chewing and poopin."
599661,Big Cliff,2011-07-05 20:16:00,6899,"And here I thought you guys were my friends  Oh well, see if you can resist this:   And thank you very much but one is enough!!!!!"
599844,jediangler,2011-07-06 03:59:00,1923,"I know two beagle owners that would tell you one is more than enough. Good luck with that little pup. I hope you don't care about your lawn...or your carpet...or your furniture...and so on, and so on."
599846,GoneFishin,2011-07-06 04:13:00,349, I'm guessing your a cat person... I wouldn't take two but every puppy is going to do some chewing and have accidents in the house and dig holes in the lawn. With propper training all of that will stop.
599859,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 09:46:00,6899," Well, in my house it is called FUR niture for a reason,   the floors are all laminate,   and if you saw my lawn, well, you'd know it isn't my biggest priority LOL. I have had and trained dogs all my life so I kind of have an idea of what to expect and what is needed LOL.  None the less, it will make Sue happy and she'll have company so I can do more fishing!"
599886,Garry2Rs,2011-07-06 12:43:00,1425,I'm arranging to get Buck a playmate this weekend...grin.
599888,Spiel,2011-07-06 12:49:00,9065, I'm having a hard time imagining Buck be excited about this Garry.
599933,jedimaster,2011-07-06 15:25:00,3472,Ah yes the trap of cute beagle puppies. Sooner or later everyone fall for those big dopey eyes and cute floppy ears. Get some hig hpowered electric tazers and you will be fine.
600060,mercman,2011-07-06 21:02:00,7054,  You are gonna love your new puppie Cliff  The natural curiousity and keen Sense of smell keep these little guys in lots of hilarious trouble
600064,misfish,2011-07-06 21:10:00,29133,PM sent bud.
600075,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 21:49:00,6899," Ah my friend, you should have met my old buddy Andy, he was a GSP, Katiebo's Andy; nose of a hound, webbed feet of a retriever, (swam like a beaver) instincts of a pointer and about 3 times the size of a beagle. He always made us laugh with some of the things he would pull LOL. I don't know how many baby birds, rabbits, or almost anything else he brought home for us to see, never hurt a feather or a hair on them. Pissed off a lot of mother birds though, they'd be dive bombing him and he couldn't understand why, he wasn't going to hurt the baby, he just wanted to show them to us. LOL. I am looking forward to having a new pup to work with. Besides, you know the old saying, if mama ain't happy, nobody is going to be happy. Well mama has always wanted a beagle."
600076,misfish,2011-07-06 21:53:00,29133,"I thought with all the fun solo,s having with Zoey,I could use a new friend."
600077,GBW,2011-07-06 21:57:00,8460,how many are spoken for and how many are left?  oh she (the Mrs) may kill me if I do this...
600085,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 22:24:00,6899, Don't know bud. email me and I'll send you the owner's email address. [emailÂ protected]
600090,misfish,2011-07-06 22:45:00,29133,"Just talk to the breeder Cliff. There was, 1 male and 2 females. There are now 2 females left."
600093,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 22:51:00,6899,"Congratulations! They are beautiful pups! Sue already wants to have a beagle G2G this fall sometime. See, the plan works!!!! Beagle G2G = Fishing G2G"
600100,GBW,2011-07-06 23:21:00,8460,"when I said to the Mrs ""I wonder what it would be like to have the sound of little paws floppingand stomping around here again would sound like?"" she said ""No!  Stop right there, not with the home daycare"".  So I'm out"
600107,Big Cliff,2011-07-06 23:56:00,6899," That's OK, if we have a beagle G2G this fall you can still come and drool"
600111,misfish,2011-07-07 00:05:00,29133,"  Whos the boss, comes to mind Chris."
600113,mercman,2011-07-07 00:10:00,7054,"  Ya big wussy  Show her who's the boss, man....Oh ya, thats right....she knows"
600118,Big Cliff,2011-07-07 00:22:00,6899, I might have thought it but to actually say it? That was just plain mean!
