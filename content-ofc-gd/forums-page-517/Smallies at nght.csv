599484,Cudz,2011-07-05 05:12:00,2652,Got out for some dusk/night fishing.  We both managed 4 bass each.  The bite was not great but we had fun

599540,Beans,2011-07-05 13:41:00,3339,"When I was a young lad (16) I never thought of going surface fishing on the Otonabee River before 09:00 pm...  A Jitterbug or Crazy Crawler was the only lures I used...  At 75 I'm not agile enough to be stumbling around in the dark...not even in the ""Tin of Beans""..."
599581,splashhopper,2011-07-05 16:13:00,2931,"i love night fishing.... I use top water lure.... u hear it,... then u feel it.... then u set it.... what a rush"
599606,smally21,2011-07-05 17:19:00,993,"?????? i dont think ive ever caught a bass after 9pm, maybe the occasional rockie. the bite on temagami shuts off at 9pm like someone slammed the door.  sounds like a good time."
599645,corvette1,2011-07-05 19:33:00,1765,cool night i bet you guys had a great time
599672,Cudz,2011-07-05 20:33:00,2652,Give it a try.  Use the right lures and I think you might be surprised
599696,kickingfrog,2011-07-05 21:15:00,8333,If I had a ringtailed lemur beard I'd fish at night too.   Nice fish.
