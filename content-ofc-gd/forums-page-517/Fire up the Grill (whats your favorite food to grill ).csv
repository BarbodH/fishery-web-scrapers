598602,dsn,2011-07-01 23:30:00,1018,"What's you're favorite food to grill on the bbq? So far here's what I have done...  Start a fire..    Done the burgers.     Done the pork chops  but not a big steak . Might give it a try.  I know you have to marinade the steaks first. So I'm lost there. Not much of a steak eater.    I have done some ribs. Not alot, which I will be doing it again.  Since it wasn't enough for everyone.     yummy.      The chicken, I'll be doing sometime this week. .     Summer... only so much one can grill. Yeah, I bought a new grill this year.  . So let see some mouth watering  pics and if you have some great ideas  or recipes by all means share your ideas with the rest of us hungry, drooling folks who are reading this post ? Or am I the only one?   karper."
598618,Fishnwire,2011-07-02 00:39:00,983,Your photos are awesome.  You clearly know your way around a grill and a camera.
598630,Ben_Daniels,2011-07-02 02:20:00,435,Gotta do a nice thick bone in ribeye! No need to marinade just some Montreal steak spice... Make sure to let the steak warm to room temp before throwing it on the grill and let it sit for atleast 5 min after cookIng!
598638,danc,2011-07-02 02:50:00,4677," I love my grilling and pretty much do it all, except for whole turkeys and such. I find Montreal spice wayyy too overpowering myself though. If I'm going to use Montreal spice, I might as well put an old sock on the grill because it will taste the same as a $30.00 T bone when all is said and done."
598645,aniceguy,2011-07-02 03:24:00,1094,the mighty grill..... love it when the q gets going a nice veal chop    some cedar planked salmon and candied red onion    some awsome grilled lamb chops with a roasted garlic potato mash    some beef ribs I made with a homemade rub and sauce    and dang desert crepes man all the way a fav here  
598677,mike rousseau,2011-07-02 10:19:00,4661,One BBQ favorite is  Guinness flavored bullseye BBQ sauce... For a store bought sauce it's first class
598697,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-02 13:12:00,2690,"For grilling, nothing beats a good medium rare steak.  I agree with Dan, keep it simple, don't cover up the taste. Since this is a fishing forum, my second favorite would be fresh caught salmon or trout.  Skin on, right on the grill.  Salt/pepper and lemon."
598701,Fang,2011-07-02 13:17:00,1330,"T-bones, striploin and lamb in no particular order. did a beef tenderloin last night. Very tender but for the price I wouldn't rush out again to buy one"
598715,NAW,2011-07-02 14:19:00,4022,"I don't have time to upload the pictures right now..  But one of my favs would have to be wood dock, or mallard.  Fresh from that morning."
598754,BillM,2011-07-02 17:19:00,17367," I use that all the time, never on steak though!  It rocks on the top of burgers.  Milo, those ribs look gooooood!"
598761,Beans,2011-07-02 18:15:00,3339,"Tonight on the barbie I'm burning a couple of Zeller's burgers for me and a President's Choice Portabello meatless burger for my wife (vegetarian)...  If you haven't tried Zeller's you're missing a good one, a bit more expensive a box than most but you get a dozen per...  I do enjoy the odd pork chop or a small beef prime rib steak ( when either is on sale )...  And of course some veggies done in the metal basket...  Best BBQ scoff in town is the smorgasboard that Meelie cooks up at the Manor ...Eh Lew ???"
598762,Blue Lk,2011-07-02 18:22:00,337,  Nuff said!
598778,tb4me,2011-07-02 19:48:00,3295,  The turkey's always turn out amazing..Below are some smoking pork bellies after curing in a brine for 12 hrs..  Whole Chickens always turn out nicely too!

599985,eman,2011-07-06 17:48:00,101,"favorites in order: Tenderloin, NY striploin, ribeye, ribs, chicken, salmon. I also like to rub my meats with oil oil then montreal steak spice. the olive oil gets the outside searing not & hot to lock in the juices."
