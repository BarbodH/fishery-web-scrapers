I purchased my first rig in the spring, previously enjoyed, with some minor wear in the vinyl which I would like to repair.  Any tips and advice on products and processes would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Millhouse  ""as an example the pic shows a small (dime sized) flap tear in the vinyl on the edge of the casting platform"" "

If I ever by another boat I don't know if I would go to vinyl again. I find it gets soft in the sun and slippery when wet. The only upside, it cleans."
599965,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-06 16:45:00,0,if you still have the flap i would glue it down  into place and might be tempted to cover it in a thin layer of something like aquaseal (used to repair waders) to make sure water isn't getting underneath.

Water proof and would never tear at that spot again."

600074,davey buoy,2011-07-06 21:49:00,5505,I would try a carpet and vinyl outlet.
