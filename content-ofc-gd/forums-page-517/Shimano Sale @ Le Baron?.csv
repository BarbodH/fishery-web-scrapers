I never used Shimano before so I am wondering if Crucial spinning rod and Sustain FE reel a good combination for crappie fishing? Which model (I mean the length of the rod and size of the reel) is good for me? What if I want to use it for bass fishing? Thanks a lot!"
599845,Duckie,2011-07-06 04:07:00,305,"I use the Sustain 1000 FE for ultralight fishing and it is amazing.  cant speak for the crucial rods, I use the G. Loomis Trout series rods, (TSR rods) which are fantastic, but not cheap.  however, the crucials have a great rep, so I am sure you will be very happy."
599856,dhickey,2011-07-06 05:33:00,1038,Go with the Clarus 6ft LM. Crucial and Comprey take a long time to get familar with. but worth it in the end. IM a shimano guy through and through wouldnt give up my rods or reals for anything.
599875,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-06 11:31:00,4399,You won`t look as cool but you can catch crappie with a 50 dollar CTC combo and a hook and minnow but hey if ya got 400-500 dollars to burn knock yourself out!
600029,jedimaster,2011-07-06 19:25:00,3472,Why spend 50 bucks when you can use a tree branch and a piece of string?
600040,John,2011-07-06 19:55:00,2956,I used to tickle the little buggers under the chin until they went to sleep.......
600065,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-06 21:11:00,4399, Yes I was actually going to say the same thing!
600069,baal,2011-07-06 21:25:00,16,Guys you are ruining my post
600083,mercman,2011-07-06 22:19:00,7054,"Dont pay them notice. They probably each own enough fishing gear to start a Bass Pro shops franchise Personally, you cant go wrong with Shimano. If you have the cash to buy the Bling, then by all means go for it. 20 % is not that big of a deal though. Shop around on Ebay, or in the Classifieds here. You'd prolly get a better deal."
600109,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-07 00:02:00,4399,here`s what ya do go buy a Sedona and a Clarus and with the 300 hundred or so you save you take half that 300 hun and give it to a charity of your choice and the remainder of that 300 hun you send to me and I will spend it wisely I promise!!!  And never mind that Paul guy he speaks with fork tongue!!!  Oh and by the way I only have one inexpensive combo!!!
600112,mercman,2011-07-07 00:08:00,7054," One Combo??? AMATEUR!!! Even lowly little newbie me, has 4...( I listen too much to the Pro's i admit."
600138,ah_long,2011-07-07 01:20:00,354,hold off on the sustain... apparently the new stradic FJs are pretty darn good
600142,baal,2011-07-07 01:47:00,16,"I am gonna give up Sustain, overpriced..."
600154,jedimaster,2011-07-07 02:31:00,3472,"If you wanna put the cash on the table and get a good reel, go pick up a front drag symetre. They are awesome. Match that with a compre if you like a light rod or a clarus if you want something a bit heavier, and you will have a great copmbo that will last you years."
