The boat has been sitting outside for this time.  I was wondering what are the first steps I should check to see if the motor will even run? or should I take it to a mech. and see if its worth while to get running?  The motor is a johnson 40hp outboard,  any help would be great or if you need any more info i will try to supply it but im not very knowlegable in this area  Thanks"
