591007,Billy Bob,2011-06-08 14:54:00,5865," Copied and Pasted from NYS DEC Website:  Free Fishing Days Each year, the last full weekend in June is designated as Free Fishing Days in New York State. During those two days, anyone can fish New York State waters, and no fishing license is required. This event started in 1991 to allow all people the opportunity to sample the incredible fishing New York State has to offer. Since no license is required, it is the perfect time to take a friend or relative fishing. In 2011, New York State's Free Fishing Days are Saturday and Sunday, June 25 & 26.  In addition to the June Free Fishing Days weekend, there are a number of ""Free Fishing Events"" held in various locations across the state. Free Fishing Events are DEC sponsored events (such as family fishing clinics) where participants can learn about fish identification, fishing equipment and techniques, fisheries management, angling ethics and aquatic ecology. Each of DEC's nine regions can sponsor up to four free fishing events per year. Most free fishing events occur during the period from April through October. For a listing of currently posted events, please view the table, but be sure to check back periodically to see if additional events have been added.  So, first time anglers, as well as those who have drifted away from the sport, should take advantage of this opportunity to see how much fun fishing can be. For more information about Free Fishing Days, contact your DEC Regional Fisheries Office.  http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6091.html  AND SORRY MUSKIE MIKE.... Didn't realize you couldn't see the whole post...I don't consider guys using their phones to participate here..."
