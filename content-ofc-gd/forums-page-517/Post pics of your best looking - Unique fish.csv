599724,splashhopper,2011-07-05 21:59:00,2931,I caught a very unique ( to me ) looking brookie this past weekend and got to thinking that most of us here have caught a fish or two that we think is beautiful or unique in its own special way.  Please post yours and give us a line or two as to why you think it is special to you.  Thanks  ........................................................................................................  Here is this past weekends brookie. Note the yellow stripe under its jaw.
