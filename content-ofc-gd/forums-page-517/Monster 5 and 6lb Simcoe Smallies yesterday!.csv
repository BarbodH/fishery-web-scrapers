600073,Slayingm,2011-07-06 21:43:00,204,"For family reason's I was not able to fish the Phenix Open/Casey Cup this opener on Simcoe for the first time in over 15 years (won it with 26.91 4yrs ago). I did get out on the opener and got a number of 4 and 5lb fish and yesterday took my Daughter and her boyfriend out on Simcoe and we nailed a number of 5 and 6lb fish and would have weighted a 5fish bag in excess of 26lbs. Drop shots rigs and jerkbaits in 5 to 12ft of water was the ticket working off some good chunk rock clusters on big flats.. also missed some pigs!.. ended the day catching perch in 40ft and diving off the boat to cool off!.. awesome day on the water!      Get out and drag some tubes, dropshots and throw some jerkbaits cause the big girls are going right now!!  Take care and good fish'n.... Greg."
