599835,Sinker,2011-07-06 03:09:00,8692,"Terry, I got an EZ lube axle with hubs and bearings for a good price from Eastons. They are out of the way for you, but I think the axle was built somewhere closer to you. Maybe give them a call and see what they say?? My axle is awesome, and worth every penny.  You need a hub face to hub face measurement, as well as the spring center meassurement. What is the capacity of your axle now? When I replaced mine, it was an up grade to a heavier axle. It came with all the hardware to install it as well.  Good guys, and great product. Wouldn't hurt to give them a shout and ask. I had mine custom built and delivered in 3 days.

600078,misfish,2011-07-06 21:58:00,29133,What are you trying to do there?
600080,Terry,2011-07-06 22:03:00,14456,I had the jack between the trailer hitch and the axle   bending it strait was the idea   when both back wheels were off the ground and it didn't move one bit I knew it was hopeless
600082,mercman,2011-07-06 22:12:00,7054,"How in the name of Gawd, did it get bent like that Terry? Amost as if someone dropped the trailer from a high place"
600084,Terry,2011-07-06 22:20:00,14456,no the bow wasn't going up on the trailer it was bent towards the back of the boat  it got caught on something in the water at the ramp  I just thought it was a rock infront of a wheel  so I put the diesel in 4x4 low and slowly drove out I didn't feel a thing....damn torque and power of a diesel...LOL
600120,misfish,2011-07-07 00:35:00,29133,How did the test drive go bud?
600130,Terry,2011-07-07 00:52:00,14456,test drive:dunno:   LOL I need to get new caps for the bearings first  tires
599577,Terry,2011-07-05 16:01:00,14456,first I have a bent axle on my trailer does anyone know where I can quickly get a replacement one near Bradford or wherever is closest  the boat has broke down on me every weekend I keep taking it back in to get fixed and it runs great  I had to limp in from georgian bay last weekend  My mechanic had me take hom and my boat to the lake today so he could see it do it too  I put in at a public ramp  when pulling out the trailer bumped something and it jump in the air a bit  didn't think any more about it  we went for a long run with the boat starting and stopping..and it ran like a brand new motor never did a thing wrong how can a mechanic fix it if he can see it doing anything wrong   as I an trailering home I see the back wheel looks funny  I stop  I bent the axle badly  I drive real slow but blow a tire   by the time I got home the other two tires are all but gone  so now I need an axle and two new tires  so back to my question any one know where to get one around these parts      the fishing gods just will not cut me a break
599584,Fisherman,2011-07-05 16:19:00,7201,"With or without brakes, measure from center to center on the spring perches and from hub face to hub face.  Then check at Princess Auto on line."
599585,Terry,2011-07-05 16:22:00,14456,"thanks I will  no brakes  51 and a half "" center to center"
599586,misfish,2011-07-05 16:31:00,29133,"Terry Let me know if you can get one at Princess auto. I,ll pick it up and bring it down."
599589,Terry,2011-07-05 16:38:00,14456,thanks I couldn't see one \ but I will need to go back and remeasure the size  it is badly bent so I am now thinking the measurement I took is wrong I will need to figure it out before I buy   or maybe I can find a cheap 16 to 17 ft trailer
599591,misfish,2011-07-05 16:46:00,29133," I have one with a boat,only $5500.   Im rethinking about our saturday outing. Maybe safer to take a bunch of bannanas on the boat."
599597,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-07-05 16:58:00,1362,I have a spare can of gas that's full as long as you have some matches...

599659,misfish,2011-07-05 20:12:00,29133,So did ya find an axle? Maybe you can remove it and bring it up here to the shop and we can try an straighten it out with the hydrualic press.
599668,Terry,2011-07-05 20:27:00,14456,I just got it off the trailer  I was trying to straiten it out so I could get the right measurement  but no luck yet  stopped to cook supper
599671,misfish,2011-07-05 20:33:00,29133,How long can it take to make a peanut butter sandwich?
599676,Terry,2011-07-05 20:38:00,14456,"it's the sauce for the spaghetti, that takes time  I eat the peanut butter while waiting"

599701,Terry,2011-07-05 21:20:00,14456, it would sure save me money  but I might just let the boat sit in the back yard broken and give up fishing..and flush 200 bucks a month down the toilet..and it would still be cheaper then that money pit......
599707,splashhopper,2011-07-05 21:27:00,2931,  ((((( Terry )))))
599790,Joey,2011-07-06 01:35:00,9122,"Jeez Terry, you just have all the luck eh!!!!!  Hope it all works out for you and the boat runs great the rest of the season."

599809,vinnimon,2011-07-06 02:05:00,2593,"Im not sure if this make you feel any better but here goes. I bought a boat 3 seasons ago knowing this issues and at a good price. The engine was shot, no problem at all. I wanted to rebuild it any way. So I did, a total rebuild. Everything was perfect on 2 outings, the third I had to be towed in I found out my cam gear went. Keep in mind I had a merc dealer press on the new gear to the new cam. Ok so I pulled the engine and fixed it( gear was pressed on by the same people),and again this time on the 5/6 outing it went on me Except I was 10 to 13 miles away from a port. Thank god I bought a kicker. As Ive shown everyone, I did pull the cam out again, went back to pick up the gear and have it pressed on, so they did. As I walked out the door, one of the techs stopped me and wanted to see the cam shaft, fine. He noticed the thrust washer was missing. Now Im fuming mad, he did add one at no charge, and a repress at no charge. Now since I pulled the gear out with the engine in the boat, I have oil leaks to deal with. My engine is coming back out in the fall to repair the leaks. Thank goodness all the labour was done by me"
