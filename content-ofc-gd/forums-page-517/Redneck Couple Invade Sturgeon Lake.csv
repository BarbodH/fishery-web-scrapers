598724,Billy Bob,2011-07-02 14:57:00,5865,"OK, here is my trip report at the ""Beautiful Bignells Resort"" (Big Cliff's Home)  I can't really do justice here but I will try my best......  Arrived Friday morning with showers on and off for most of the drive....  We parked across the street from Cliff's house and was given a VERY WARM WELCOME from Cliff and his lovely wife Sue......Cliff quickly escorted us to our fully furnished BEAUTIFUL Bungalow overlooking Sturgeon Lake...    Cliff immediately began helping us carry all our stuff so we could get settled in...and then it was off to the boat ramp with Cliff which was only 4 doors down to launch my faithful Old Grumman....  and yes the hubs never touched the water...  THANKS AGAIN CLIFF....with rain in the forecast for the next few days we wondered how we were to going to cope....but have no fear we were greeted with a Canadian Survival Package....  At first I was guessing it was Christmas in Canada but on further examination it was a package from a friend from afar....Paul better known here as MercMan.....Paul had include many items like Canadian hat buttons, a small hand towel, screw drivers, a GREAT BBQ Sauce and some REAL CANADIAN MAPLE SYRUP....and also a  spinner rig with a yellow sally that I didn't get to use because we were fishing so shallow all week long....and I can't forget the Canadian Flag sunglasses that I would put on every time it would rain....and they worked...the sun would come right out...  It would be like the above picture and shortly after I put on my Canadian Sunglasses this would happen.  THANK YOU PAUL for your thought fullness and generosity. If anyone remembers I ordered our fishing licenses by phone and the Canadian Fishing Ministry was very quick to get them to us....BUT....they never sent any regs with them so Cliff downloaded Area 17 for me....since we always have gotten the conservation license I was SHOCKED to see they reduce the limit to ONE WALLEYE per conservation license....so you will not see multiple fish pics because I would fish mostly alone while the bride slept in every morning...but I did catch some fish..  The first caught walleye on Saturday morning.   A very nice 12"" crappie that is still swimming in Sturgeon Lake.   And to show not everyone was a keeper a 7.5"" walleye  And of course I had to take out the bride once she was well rested and I cooked her breakfast outside on the griddle.  And she did get her share of fish....     My bride Cindy always insist we take boat rides and this trip wasn't any different...we cruised to Fenelon Falls and also Bobcaygeon and of course took some photo's for our scrap book.    On Sunday we were invited to break bread with Cliff and his lovely wife Sue....Cliff made up his famous Caveman Ribs and they were spectacular...only problem I was so busy eating I didn't take any pics of that dinner....my bad...  On Tuesday we also shared a meal and this time Sue and Cliff were the guest....but again no pictures....  but you might ask Cliff how his head was the next day from drinking my Lancaster Ice Tea drinks...  However, Sue and Cliff insisted we return for another meal on Thursday as this would be our last full day to eat, drink and be merry with our new Canadian Friends....  ...we had to leave early the next morning to beat the holiday traffic.  But this time I remembered to take some photo's and let me tell you, Cliff is one good CHEF...his Roasted Garlic Soup is to DIE FOR....AND HE BAKED HIS OWN BREAD...try to beat that boys...     When we heard one of Cliff's offered dinners to us was his Famous Caveman Ribs we had to give him this T-Shirt....Actually I was taken a photo of Sue but he ran in at the last moment...   We all spent a lot of time doing this when we weren't ishing and enjoyed every moment of it.    And last but not least I got to hook up with the Kawartha Lake's legendary angler, Shane....better known here as Sinker....and let me tell you he lived up to that reputation....we had a huge cold front blow in on Tuesday with LOTS of rain and HEAVY winds that continued to blow when we met up mid morning on Wednesday....  So even with 20-30 mph winds we set out for some walleyes on Rice Lake...using just small bladed worm harnesses and ONE split shot we trolled and drifted over mid lake weed beds....Sinker kept catching catfish while I kept reeling in weeds....I finally got one small walleye but still spent more time taking off weeds until Shane gave me a mid size split shot to replace my very light bullet sinker I was using....I finally got a nice keeper walleye and so did Shane....we ended up with four walleyes caught, two which went home for dinner but we talked a LOT about hunting, mostly waterfowl hunting that the six hours FLEW BY before we knew it....I would really like to share my boat next time with Sinker, hopefully someday on Lake Erie for perch as I know that's his favorite fish to catch and eat. THANK YOU SHANE, I REALLY enjoyed my day with you....I have fished with MANY MANY anglers and your at the top of my long list of those I would drop anything to share another day in the boat with.  Since we were so busy shooting the Bull I didn't shoot many pictures but here's the two I did take...the second is one of the catfish Shane caught.    Cliff was trying to convince us to stay until today so we could meet several others on the board here but we have my sister in-laws coming over for a BBQ and I thought that would be cutting it too close with all the holiday traffic, especially on the bridges.  So next time Cliff we will have to plan around that G2G BBQ get together at your place....HOPEFULLY next summer.  THANK YOU AGAIN CLIFF & SUE.... you are both so VERY KIND people and Cindy and I are PROUD to have you has our new FRIENDS....and don't forget your always welcome in our Redneck Home.  Bob & Cindy"

598953,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-03 17:39:00,2582,"Debbe and I have stayed over at Cliff & Sue's and broke some of Cliffs homemade bread at their supper table so I know exactly what your saying about making you feel like family. You would have a hard time finding a nicer couple. You can't help but have a great time with them.  And Shayne is a stand up guy and a great fisherman as well.  Great food,company and some time on the water with someone who knows how to catch fish.  Sounds like a great holiday to me"
598970,GBW,2011-07-03 19:04:00,8460,great report!  had I been aware or the times you were in Fenlon I would have made the trip over to say hi.  those falls are 20 min from my folks place where I was this weekend.
599219,Beans,2011-07-04 14:25:00,3339,"  One of Cliff's and my favourite areas to fish for smallies...anchored just south of there where the water starts to deepen...  Too bad you had to leave so early, I was going to try to talk CPH into going to Cliff and Sue's on Friday and do some carpfishing but we went elsewhere and I let him get ahead countwise for this year...  It's a ""given"" that you would have a good time at the Bignells..."
