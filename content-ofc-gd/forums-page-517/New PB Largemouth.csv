599376,bdox,2011-07-04 23:46:00,329,"I'm way too lazy after 8 straight days of bass fishing for a full blown report, so here she is. My new PB largemouth.  Caught on a 7'5 NRX, 1/4oz Buckeye Mop Jig  Can't wait for September, where this girl and the 5lb 10oz my buddy caught should be pushing 6.            "
599377,Terry,2011-07-04 23:46:00,14456,very nice fish way to go

599428,splashhopper,2011-07-05 01:41:00,2931,great fish  happy ending
599444,Live2fish85,2011-07-05 02:25:00,1633,That's a hog way to go.
599557,bdox,2011-07-05 14:43:00,329,"Thanks for all the replies. While it was a great catch, it was already obsolete in our friendly derby between the 5 of us on the trip. My buddy had caught his PB 5lb 10oz 2 days before and it held to take the money!"
599561,4x4bassin,2011-07-05 15:03:00,1025,Nice one and kudo's for letting her swim for another day.
599565,limeyangler,2011-07-05 15:11:00,5204,Love the second to last shot...that thing is HUGE!  Great post....congrats on a fantastic PB fish.
599568,ryan a harris,2011-07-05 15:29:00,17,"Nice release, Heck of a bass."
599595,Steve,2011-07-05 16:55:00,2075,"meh, i guess it was ok.    You still have a BIG two ounces to go before you beat me!!!  Bwahahahahaha.  Seriously though, Brian owned that fish. Hook set and craned into the boat before I could even get the net....well, it was in my hands, but brian was having none of it.  You lucky that flouro lead held!  Congrats again bud.  (and yes, we both have a ways to go before we can touch my old man!)"
599617,FrankTheRabbit,2011-07-05 17:52:00,479,What a lunker of a fish!
599636,Harrison,2011-07-05 19:02:00,2202,Congrats BUD!  That's a bassthumber right there!  Cool shirt too.
599773,msp,2011-07-06 01:01:00,1336,"Nice largie. She looks very healthy and green. Was she deep, shallow ?"
599854,EC1,2011-07-06 05:10:00,930,Beauty fish! I see lots of NRX's on board! Beauty rods too! lol
599902,bdox,2011-07-06 13:34:00,329," She was sitting in about 3.5-4ft of water, right on the edge of a bed of pencil reeds.   Hands down most sensitive rod (almost too sensitive sometimes, crazy, I know!) I've ever used. People talk about GLX being an extension of your arm, well I might as well just cut off my arm and replace it with an NRX!"
599948,bicephalic,2011-07-06 16:19:00,112,Nice bucket!
