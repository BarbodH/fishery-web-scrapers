599653,FISHINGNUT,2011-07-05 19:54:00,253,I just recieved a phone call from my insurance company informing me that I need to have a boat survey done on my boat by July 18th or they will not renew my policy .I own a 1989 17 foot aluminum bow rider with a 50hp the boat has been insured by the same company for 8 yrs with no claims made by me or any problems.Now all of a sudden I have to get this done ??? I am in the Kitchener area closest place is 45min away and they want $400.00 and cant do it till mid August.Am I out to lunch why $400 and why do I need this??? Anyone have any suggestions or have had similiar situation. I know the boat is older but I had an appraisal done and summited pics 2 yrs ago to them to verify the condition Thanks Jamie
599656,Terry,2011-07-05 20:00:00,14456,89  50 hp 400 bucks  do you even need insurance   go to a different insurance company and they will fix you up  unless you are insuring it for far more then they think it is worth
599657,FISHINGNUT,2011-07-05 20:07:00,253,Thats $400 just for the boat survey then $350 a year to insure it its only insured for $4500 with contents
599660,smally21,2011-07-05 20:13:00,993,my thoughts exactly terry.  something to think about for sure.
599662,Raf,2011-07-05 20:16:00,3495,shop around  $350 for $4500 coverage is waay too much.  you should get more than double that coverage for $350/yr
599664,misfish,2011-07-05 20:18:00,29133,"I had a 87 ranger,insured it for 10 g,s .Never had an issue. My 89 Bayliner same thing. If anything,you want liability.Was told you dont need a survey for that. Is it still not true if you are towing the boat,it,s covered by your auto insurance?"
599683,mercman,2011-07-05 20:47:00,7054,Just got a quote for my new boat 432/year.Sounds about right if you have full replacement on it.  
600041,FISHINGNUT,2011-07-06 19:58:00,253,Thanks for the repiles guys. Made sum phone calls yesterday all the insurance companies I talked to said there was no need for a boat survey on an aluminum boat just wanted picture proof and most were 1/2 the price of my current insurer for the same coverage . So i guess it pays to shop around just saved over $550 for making a few calls.
