I am a Deputy Sheriff and been working in the law enforcement field for almost 4 years.  I also love to hunt...when it comes to hunting I hunt pretty much anything, but I am a avid white-tail hunter.  I'm actually headed to Iron Bridge, Ontario in two days to do some serious fishing.  This will be my third trip to Iron Bridge...I love it there.  Last year I brought along with me two guys i work with and they loved it some much they wanted to come this year.  We mostly fish for smallmouth and pike, but this year we would like to catch a few walleye.  The times that i have been to Iron Bridge we mostly fish Red Rock lake which is part of the Mississagi River.  Its Great fishing, but after a week of fishing it slows down a little. This year we plan to target some different lakes in the area like: Tunnel lake, Bright Lake, Lauzon Lake, and maybe the North Channel. I have already started a topic before I introduced myself and thats my bad, but if anyone has any tips for that area that would be great!  I want your honey holes just some tips or some good lakes in the area! THANKS!"
