Biggest eye – over 9 Lbs Biggest bow – over 7 lbs  3 people - 5 rods (6 at times) 18 eyes and 6 bows in the cooler for about 4 hrs.... Lost about 7-8 more... 60'+ fow 30-40 feet down spoons and worm harnesses slow troll riggers, dipsy and leadcore all did well but advantage to the leadcore Only few sheep heads  Nothing better than great catching day with good friends  \ Few shots of happy campers (pardon me - fishermen;-):              Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
