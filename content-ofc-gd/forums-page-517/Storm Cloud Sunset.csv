599467,Nipfisher,2011-07-05 04:04:00,2449,Nice shooting. How come you didn't toss a line out while you were snapping. You probably could a got your limit in the 20 or so minutes you were out there lol. You have a beautiful property Simon. My favourite is the second last picture with the reeds in it.
599470,limeyangler,2011-07-05 04:12:00,5204,    This is from the same set of pics tonight Blair....answer your question?....and yes...limit was achieved albeit all very small.   
599473,Nipfisher,2011-07-05 04:25:00,2449,"You piss me off with every report Simon  Glad to be o n the same derby team though.  I am very envious. What no pics of Jack? I'm guessing he was getting ready for bed.I had Karter out on the dock this weekend and we caught about 100 dink perch, smallies and rock bass. He loves holding them and throwing them into the water."
599474,Dozer,2011-07-05 04:26:00,896,"Wow, that is all I have to say."
599494,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-05 09:44:00,2582,Thx for sharing Simon. I enjoyed them all.  I'm not a camera guy at all...it rarely occurs to me to snap a few shots of what's going on around me. But I sure do appreciate when others take the time.
599516,Joey,2011-07-05 11:57:00,9122,"Those are brilliant photos Simon, love them, thanks.  I borrowed a few"
599522,Spiel,2011-07-05 12:18:00,9065, Your guides aren't straight Simon but I see from your amazing photos that there's nothing wrong with your vision.
599524,radar,2011-07-05 12:30:00,138,Wow!!!! I love crazy weather.
599531,Rod Caster,2011-07-05 12:48:00,5784,"That's wild, especially mixed in with a sunset. now go find a photocontest online."
599547,Jds63,2011-07-05 14:10:00,1365,great shots Simon !!!
599548,NAW,2011-07-05 14:12:00,4022,"Man, those are some nice pictures man.  I've never seen clouds quite like that before."
599550,PikeMolester,2011-07-05 14:20:00,428,that was a crazy storm here on eagle lake
599553,Old Man,2011-07-05 14:35:00,822,Great pics Simon. That was one heck of a storm. The wind had me fearing for my dock and it knocked the corn in my garden flat. Thank god we missed the tennis ball sized hail that SE Manitoba got out of that system. I didn't like the look of it on the horizon and had parked both our vehicles in our storage shed just in case.
599562,limeyangler,2011-07-05 15:09:00,5204," Hey Blair, yup...sucks to be me! No pics of karter's perch fest?  I was gonna do a trip with jack that evening...but the sky looked ominous. Really glad we did stay back, even though the little lake we intended on going to is very sheltered, the wind the storm whipped up was scary     LOL...thats what i said too when i walked outside and saw the clouds    No probs CPH, my pleasure.    Thanks Joey, cant take much credit though, the scenery was there and the point and shoot did the rest.    LOL....i was wondering if anyone would notice    Me too, I turned off the lights in the living room and Jack sat on my lap and we watched the show for half an hour....He loved it!    Yeah the timing of the sunset was perfect!   Thannx JDS!    Me either, really strange."
599564,limeyangler,2011-07-05 15:09:00,5204," Yeah...it must have hit there first. Whats the fishing been like....i went a couple of times recently...slow to say the least...all the spots i usually do well at have dried up, marking fish...no takers...fishfly hatch ya think?    LOL...yeah...Jack's climber/slide went for a spin round the yard...was quite the scene watching my wife chase it around.....i would have gone out to help....but i'd just done my hair and did not want the wind and rain to ruin it"
599587,ehg,2011-07-05 16:31:00,2666,Wow! Wow! Triple Wow!  You captured a real unbelievable and somewhat special moment. Those type of clouds are called mammatus and only occur on the back end of big thunderstorms.  You could win a photo contest with that series especially on a meteorlogical/climatological website.  Again you are truly blessed to be in an area with great fishing all around and incredible scenery at your doorstep. Thanks for sharing this with us.
599736,danc,2011-07-05 22:52:00,4677,What an awesome sight Simon. Although sometimes it's better to see stuff like this on the internet than with your own eyes.
599743,Bernie,2011-07-05 23:49:00,3190,Very cool shots Simon! Only seen clouds like that a couple of times.  Thanks for telling me what they are EHG.
599746,Blue Lk,2011-07-05 23:52:00,337,"Simon,those pics are awesome. I was at GF's place in Eagle River when the storm went through,I saw those clouds & thought damn, my camera is at home. I talked to a buddy who lives in Oxdrift today,during the storm the wind sucked a skylight right off his roof letting the water pour right in. Glad you got the pics,you sure don't see the sky like that too often."
599755,PikeMolester,2011-07-06 00:12:00,428,ya prolly the hatch. there are thousands  of flys on the surface everywhere. Pike are hitting as always.Been slow for 2 days for walleye and bass.
599792,splashhopper,2011-07-06 01:37:00,2931,amazing.... some of those clouds looked like tears from heaven
599798,Fisherman,2011-07-06 01:43:00,7201,"That's mother nature at work, amazing shots."
599898,PainInTheBass,2011-07-06 13:15:00,102,Those pics are incredible!  It looks like a painting - those clouds are so surreal.  Great shots!
