599767,Rod Caster,2011-07-06 00:56:00,5784,"4:00pm text to Joey: Wanna go fishing? 4:05pm text to me: Yes 4:30pm pickup 4:55pm launch  We decided to decipher another tiny lake with our best pal sportspal and try out for some largemouth bass. It was a windy night so we headed for a sheltered area with plenty of emergent vegetation and began casting top water. With no signs of top water hits, or surfacing fish we slowed things down and I hooked into a decent Largie using a slammer on dropshot.    The iceth, was brokeneth....but the action slowed down for bass. Twenty minutes later Joey, with his trusty wacky worm, casted right on bullseye and got a nice hit. At first it was a good bass. Then it was a huge pike. Then it was a huge walleye.          23.5"". We were both in complete shock as we were unaware that there were any walleye in the lake at all. Elated, we carried on and felt a few decent hits and only one more fish landed.      Had we stayed until dusk, the action would have picked up but he had work duties and I was ready to pack it in.... having no seats in the canoe is a real pain in the  , quite literally.  Gotta love small lakes!!!"
