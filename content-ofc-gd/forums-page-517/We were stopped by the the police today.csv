It's pretty easy to take swipes at folks in the south who have to deal with this sort of thing on a regular basis... when you live in an area that has little guardianship... you can't compare it to where we live and fish. Butif you feel that you need to take that kind of shot, fill yer boots! HH"
600272,Dara,2011-07-07 14:24:00,3052,  You folks in the south need to deal with it...you are the cause of all the excessive regulations.  Don't think for a second that there is little guardianship up here too. I get stopped every time I get on my snowmobile and many times on the boat.  If I head to a backwoods lake I may avoid getting searched but you can't count on it. I have been heading down a gravel road and stopped by the OPP for a gun check just because I had an orange jacket on.
600280,Rodwrap,2011-07-07 14:41:00,130,"I remember once in PA, my wife & I were walleye fishing & we had a couple hanging on a stringer over the side of the boat. A small tinny with 2 guys in it 'sneaked' up behind us, then beside us about 50 ft. away. Ther were waterways patrolmen, & asked to see life jackets & fishing licenses, no problem. Then they noticed the stringer, & asked to see the fish. Wifey bent over to pick up the stringer, & in doing so, accidentally revealed both D-cups to full view of the officers. I was in the bow & didn't realize what was happening, but ,wondered what was taking so long to view the fish! After a good full minute, they said ok..& putted off with big smiles..THEN...I figured out what happened"

PRODUCE YOUR PAPERS PLEASE. show me the contents of your bag, cooler, compartment, whatever. all without any evidence of any wrongdoing.  im not hiding anything, i just dont like my fishing, boating to be interrupted by invasive, uncalled for stops."

I had the 3 year card, but never knew about needing to buy a new sticker each year. The officer was very polite and was ready to let me go, but I said I was in the wrong and should not be giving a free ride. A quick ride into shore, a few bucks latter I was back up to standards. I would have felt that I cheated the system if he let go.  What would be the items you need on a vessel?  Boaters card PFD's one per person manual bailing bucket(my boat has electric bilge pump as well) flares? lights  I'm new to boat owner ship, and have yet to slip my fishing machine into the water.

599627,Jer,2011-07-05 18:32:00,1426,"    -flares and lights are not necessary on smaller vessels (unless you are out after dusk, then proper navigation lights are required) -whistle or air-horn -floating, waterproof flashlight (with working batteries) -a paddle or an anchor with at least 50 feet of rope -a floating, heaving line (I believe at least 50') -fire extinguisher if boat has a built-in fuel tank  ...see, you woulda been missing all kinds of things, as much as a $240 fine for each missing item.

They check the labels on the jackets, make sure the flashlight works, check through the cooler for beer, even though they already asked several times.  Then since they could not find any reason to ticket them they recommended that they should have spare flashlight batteries, which they already had even though they are never out at night.  Both my dad and his friend were upset and it ruined their whole day.  I know most cops are good guys and are out there for the common good, but I cannot understand why they would be harassing seniors."

600003,aplumma,2011-07-06 18:35:00,6896,  One... come on really?? have you not read of all of the instances of the publicized attacks and also the ones prevented? It is a changing world and violence while not wanted is a fact of life as it changes the way we police our zones of civilization.If anyone chooses to fish a border area then you accept the fact that you are going to be checked. Right now the US and Canada are both being like little kids and having a peeing contest to see who can make the other madder. Both sides will settle down soon I hope and we can go back to the rules we have become used too.  Art

600025,Headhunter,2011-07-06 19:17:00,5703,"If being stopped on the water was about safety, there are easier and faster, more cost efficient ways of doing so... Why not have the authorities posted at launch sites. Have you and your boat checked before you hit the water. Should you have all the required equipment, your boat gets a sticker that is good for the season. They could still patrol but they would not have to pull up to anyone, who has the sticker. Kinda makes a ton of sense, doesn't it! But that won't happen because they are not out there to ensure we have all required equipment... they are out there to generate revenue. Should you think differently, perhaps you should reconsider. HH"
600042,aplumma,2011-07-06 20:02:00,6896," We actually have that here in the USA you can have your boat certified by the Coast Guard. They come to the marina's for free and everyone who signs up gets inspected and a sticker issued. This however does not mean you will not be checked on the water it just makes the inspection quicker they generally will ask you to hold up 2 or 3 items on the list and wave bye as they leave. They are still making sure you are not drinking and have the correct licenses and what color your wife's bikini is or your speedo just to be fair to all of the MNR officials. I am not sure about the revenue money grab angle if you know the rules beforehand and you comply with them their is no fine. I have yet to pay a ticket in my life on the water owning 4 boats at this time. Each one has all of the requirements on board at all times so that's 4 paddles, 4 flare sets...etc it is the price you pay before the price they charge for improper boating.  Art"
600058,lew,2011-07-06 20:54:00,12766,I had a friend with the coastguard auxillary who did the safety check on my boat and when it passed he gave me a windshield sticker showing everything was good and met the safety requirements.  Awhile later I was stopped by the OPP and I told him he didn't need to check me as I already passed the CCG test and showed him the sticker. He said the sticker made no difference to him cause just because everything was good & legal  at one point didn't mean I was legal now because I may no longer have all the gear required by law. I was stopped a couple more times over the season and basically was told by each cop that the sticker meant nothing to them.  Try to do the right thing and we still get hassled.
600086,Billy Bob,2011-07-06 22:28:00,5865,"It would make better sense if you would contact your political Representative to address these concerns as they are valid and I agree with you guys....our Coast Guard Auxiliary makes the inspections and issues the stickers as per aplumma....at one time I had so many on top of each other that it stuck out about 3/8"" from the windshield..."

It's been decades since I have been pulled over in my car just to ""check it"". There are thousands of unsafe vehicles on the road yet there is little to no emphasis on that. Yes, I realize there are still a few boaters that may not have all they should have. Never see them at boat launches checking folks before they hit the water which would make a little more sense."

The OPP now have a new type of unit just to police Snowmobiles, Boats,and ATV's.  They target outdoorsman. Hunters, fisherman, and ATV and snowmobile trail riders.  Personally I would rather my tax dollars that are spent on OPP are put to a division that targets, CRIMINALS.  I have been stopped 23 times in 2011 by OPP on snowmobiles, in boats and on an ATV. Each time they claimed it was a standard ""Document"" check. wanting to see if I had my proper licences, cards, plates, permits, insurance, Registry documents, ETC ETC ETC. Got to carry a breifcase to go in the woods now and do a little fishing and hunting.  When all the drive by street shootings and muggers and theives are caught. When crime in our cities is non-exixtent, I would be pleased then to see the OPP out in the woods and backcountry checking on all the paperwork we are required to carry to go fishing and hunting , sledding, atv riding etc   GET the OPP out of the bush and back on the streets, where the criminals are.  I guess though if I were an OPP officer, I would really push for a patrol area were I got to drive a boat all summer, ride an ATV through the fall forests and go sleddin in the winter.

599502,SmokestackLightnin,2011-07-05 10:41:00,390," Totally agree with this and others who have commented. The OPP have created a scenario where most of the uniformed officers are just highly trained tax collectors. Due to policing of smaller towns they feel the heat to generate revenue so we therefore have situations where we require a number of documents and paperwork and then get ""zero tolerance"" when something is missing. I can't imagine the outrage if they stopped every vehicle on the road for ""document checks"" on a continuous basis."
599507,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-05 11:28:00,4399,  A   driving a sled 90 miles an hour down a street is a criminal just like the   I saw last year on Hwy 9 doing wheelies on his ATV!!!
599512,fish_fishburn,2011-07-05 11:43:00,1311,It's quite simple.  Doing real police work to catch criminals on our streets before and during crimes they commit cost alot of money and is hard on the police resources. Picking on and harassing joe taxpayer (not a criminal) is very cost efficient and brings a windfall of money to the coffers.
599513,fish_fishburn,2011-07-05 11:51:00,1311,And why is it here on the Ottawa River it seems like whenever I see the marine unit with someone pulled over for a check it is always the guy in the tinny fishing boat getting the gears?  I have yet to see a cruiser over 25 feet pulled over and checked out. And there the boats with the full bars on board. Thats one of the reasons I love my bassboat. If you want to check me out meet me 30 miles up the river in the rock infested bay I will be fishing in.
599515,smally21,2011-07-05 11:56:00,993,"i get stopped alot and it is annoying. i chalk it up to the cost fo doing business.  what i find odd about the live stop in the boat is that it is, by def'n, unconstitutional. a police officer is not supposed to interfere with a law abiding citizen going about their business. a random stop of a vehicle to check your docs is not viewed as accepatable in this country - you know, the probable cause they always talk about on tv.  nor are we stopped on the street and asked to produce our papers.  but as soon as we step on a boat we are subject to a random stop and search that would be unlawful were you in your car.  RIDE programs are unconstitutional stops as well, pulling over people for no reason, however the courts deemed it OK as it was 'for the greater good""  i just dont recall anyone ever saying that about police checks of boats. in the bay down at hamilton ive been stopped 3 times on the same outing, 2X by the same boat!"
