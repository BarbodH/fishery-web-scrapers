599299,rhymobot,2011-07-04 20:23:00,174,"Hello anglers.  I have an inflatable right now powered by my arms and I'm looking to upgrade and put a troller on it.  There's a 12 foot Jon boat on sale at Cdn Tire right now for $599. It says it's 120 lbs.  Jon boat link    Since I don't have a trailer and really don't have the space to keep one, I need a boat that I can mount on my car roof and store in my garage standing up.  So...  1. Do I need a boat made out of fibre glass (aluminum too heavy right?) so me and a buddy can mount and dismount the boat from the roof? 2. Can I find something like that used and in working condition for much cheaper than $600? 3. Do you think this boat at Canadian Tire is worth it?   Thanks."
599305,Terry,2011-07-04 20:39:00,14456,well a 12 ft aluminum boat weighs between 115 and 150 lbs....  but for easy to store and transport I like a port-a-bote..folding boat http://www.porta-bote.com/dimension.php but you ain't going to get it for 600 bucks
599307,vance,2011-07-04 20:41:00,719,"A buddy of mine had one of those,it was okay for calm water on small lakes with one person but with 2 up and the motor it was maxed out for capacity and the passenger had to bail all the time if it got a little rough.  vance"
599336,dhickey,2011-07-04 22:01:00,1038,I would go with a 12ft alluminum and a 6-9 hp motor. You can probably get both for around 600 in decent shape if you take your time and look around. Dont go fiberglass.!! I did 15 years ago but I regret it because I had to strip the gellcoat and reskin it .. TO mutch work even though the kids  use it as thier first fishig boat.
599401,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-05 00:39:00,2585,im working with a company right now that will help you launch that boat without a trailer.  send me a pm and I will send you the details.  I cant quite go public with it yet that is why we will have to talk via PMs  Cheers!
599410,mercman,2011-07-05 00:54:00,7054,"You know, for the weekend warrior those boats are well made. Not fiberglass, but a tough plastic resin. I wouldnt want to use it when it gets really cold.May crack."
599423,NAW,2011-07-05 01:24:00,4022,"That CT boat would be ok on small calm lakes, with a light payload.  But in the bigger waters, I would want to go with a deeper haul.  You're in a tough spot with the storage / transportation thing.  Have you put any though in getting a square back sports pal.  It's light, fits on the roof of your car, and you can hang it from the rafters in your garage."
599431,trevy727,2011-07-05 01:48:00,351,A squareback canoe or a 12' aluminum boat will go on the roof of your car easily. I've had a 12' boat on top of a Hyundai accent. Just put a couple 2x4's across and strap it down. A 12'er only weighs 130lbs.
599489,OutdoorDan,2011-07-05 06:15:00,325,Have you considered a Sportspal canoe with a square or transom back and a 2hp motor on it? They are super light and easy to get into back lakes. If you look around kijiji you may find a good deal.
599611,rhymobot,2011-07-05 17:27:00,174,Thank you to everyone for this very valuable input. Now I got a lot of thinking and checking around to do now that I see there's so many options.
599616,jimmer,2011-07-05 17:49:00,2730,"It might even depend on how many times you plan to go fishing and where you are going. Is there a rental option? Sometimes it's just better to rent if it's only a couple of times a year. I agree that 12 footers are okay for light people and smaller bodies of water, but get grown men in one and then some wind and you are asking for a bath."
599648,jedimaster,2011-07-05 19:43:00,3472,I would rather be in a 12foot hard bottom zodiac than a 12 foot alluminum any day of the week. I don't mean a little dinghy type inflatable I mean a real zodiac. They are super solid and easialy transportable in a car.  Here are just a few. Try ad look into a RIB.The are great boats.  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-powerboats-motorboats-10-zodiac-omc-W0QQAdIdZ295227709  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-other-Dinghy-ZODIAC-W0QQAdIdZ294646062  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-seadoos-water-powersports-zodiac-Mark-I-Touring-fold-up-boat-W0QQAdIdZ287587086
