600031,kickingfrog,2011-07-06 19:34:00,8333,"We seem to be selective about how we remember players.  Sudin often did holler at refs and opponents. Did he foam at the mouth like sideshow bob? No. Did he chase guys around the ice for a cheap-shot? No.  He could play a physical game (he was built similar to Lindros) but he was better at setting up some very run-of-the-mill linemates. We are very passionate about our sports, but that passion clouds our judgment sometimes as well.  He rarely missed games, and when he was injured he came back quicker then predicted more often then not.  None of that means that I think he was the best hockey player ever, but it does mean that I think he does not get as much credit as he deserves."
600032,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-06 19:39:00,0,"  I'm sure plus/minus means very little to leaf fans. If you think your top forward line having stats like -20 and -29 isn't a relative stat then you're talking out your   .  I guess I'm not ""on the inside"" of hockey like you are.     Who are your major league affiliations anyways?  I do consider myself to know the game quite well btw."

599646,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-05 19:34:00,0,"while sundin might have seemed like a marquee player to sens fans like myself (got burned by him in many battle of ontarios) I don't think Toronto has had a true star in a long time.  i really don't think kessel is that star.  i look forward to this years ""battle of the basement"" so my sens can show burke what a rebuild looks like."
599658,ehg,2011-07-05 20:09:00,2666,"Ya, but Mats Sundin was one of the best players in the world for a bit when with laffs.  Another great player, one of the best all round ever, was a long time Leaf. Wendel Clark! Aside from his D'Angelo apple juice commercials he seemed to be shy to be ""marquee"".  Your right though HH, Gilmour really was toast of this town... doesn't look like there is any similar in future. At least us Montrealers in the future have Subban et al;   and somehow always don't run into these problems."
599690,Nipfisher,2011-07-05 21:01:00,2449,"What about Owen Nolan, Mike Gartner, and the ""washed up defenceman"" from the Rangers. Why keep taking these guys at the ends of their careers? The leafs need to develop their own marquee player. Not rent or buy one off the market. Burke said it would take 4 years. This is year 3 I believe."
599697,jedimaster,2011-07-05 21:15:00,3472,"I am hopeful, but Burkes 4 year plan included giving up two number 1's for Kessle to pan out."
599708,kickingfrog,2011-07-05 21:27:00,8333,"For many people Mats did only 2 things wrong.  1. He was born in Sweden, not Canada.  2. He played for the Leafs.   Oh and he apparently didn't pimp himself out enough?"
599716,Jigger,2011-07-05 21:40:00,1237, There really should be a sarcasm font  Mats is the best player to ever wear the Blue and White IMO.  Edit: When Seguin scores 3 consecutive 30 goal seasons you can tell me the Leafs lost that deal. I guess it'll have to be 4 because Phil has already done 3.
599738,cjgraham,2011-07-05 23:19:00,104,Toronto had a marquee player.....his name was Jeff Finger.
599761,tb4me,2011-07-06 00:33:00,3295,I have to agree Sundin was a great leaf too..Anyone that says other wise just search him on youtube. It wont take long to see he was a great leaf..Ya he didnt pimp himself out after the games and on commercials. But why bother when your bringing home 5.5 mill a year..I know I wouldnt. I also think Wyndel Clarke Tie Domi and Darcy Tucker was all that was leafs in their prime. Anyway great thread folks! I enjoy the read. Lets keep it going
599766,Jds63,2011-07-06 00:51:00,1365,"My wife bought me a Leaf Jersey , paid big bucks too... with Domi's name .... she always heard me yelling his name every time he was on the ice so she figured that was who I liked the most .... always enjoyed watching Sundin as well ... he gave us some great memorable goals, as did Sittler, Salming, Gilmour and Clark.  I can remember watching the Leafs back in the the late 60's, but was a Bruins and Habs fan as a kid. Now I am watching a whole new era of Leafs hope they get another young lad to step up and be a superstar, we need it !!!!"
599918,blaque,2011-07-06 14:28:00,2419,"Mcarthur and Connolly re-united. lol You guys did pretty well snapping up Mcarthur from us as i believe he panned out well for you last year? Or at least had a few streaks that i recall.  I can assure you however, you will be disapponted with your latest sabre acquisition. Next to Roy........he was tops on the list of players we wanted to go bye bye. For example.......if we wanted to stretch and give him any praise at all, we had to look HARD and found a small bright spot in his penalty killing. Not exactly what your looking for in a player of his supposed skill. Buffalo milked that cow for a long LONG tenure and i wish him well...........but i assure you guys, you will not be impressed.  I almost feel bad for the guy as hes had a tough go at it injury wise........he surely has the talent, but it doesnt manifest itself on the ice."
599932,jedimaster,2011-07-06 15:21:00,3472,"The numbers are better comming back for the Leafs but I doubt any leaf fan is thinking any of the moves this year is going put us over the top. I dout anyone from the sabres could make a difference.  Some people enjoyed the plodding along of Sundin with flashes of great skill. The truth is he mailed it in long before he left Toronto. Sundin is and always will be in my mind a good hockey player, with little heart, no leadership and good hands. A solid supporting character. Does e remind you of anyone on the Leafs now? Kessle. he has a similar makeup but I think Kessle is a better pure goal scorer. He desperatly needs a leader to follow. I can't even imagine how people would breahe Clarke, Gilmour or Sittler in the same breathe as Sundin. Makes me ill."
599934,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-06 15:25:00,0,did sundin et al ever make it past the 2nd round? maybe once in the late 90's?
599936,Live2fish85,2011-07-06 15:28:00,1633,"I agree with Jedimaster Sundin was good but nothing to compare to Gilmour, Clarke, Sittler they all had a love for the game and true heart Mats didn't have that he was skilled and that's about it. Gilmour was the last truely good player for the leafs. And kessel is a usless twit. He won't ever do anything for a team as long as they don't have someone willing to skate it up and pass it to kessel he's nothing. Kessel is a chicken. I know Kessel has skill but the balls aren't there or the true heart. IMO."
599938,jedimaster,2011-07-06 15:33:00,3472,"I believe on 98-99 and 01-02, but this was with some great leaders that the leafs brought in like Mogilny, Cujo, Gilmour, Tucker, Roberts, Belfour"
599939,jedimaster,2011-07-06 15:36:00,3472,"  I don't recal seeing Roberts going on outbursts or rants but he did play with emotion and played with heart and was a leader. A player doesn't need to rant and rave on the ice. But he has play with heart. Something Sundin rarely did. Look at how great he played when he played for his country in the olympics. He played gritty, hard and with heart. Something I rarely saw him do even in the playoffs. and I saw several deep play off games in person. This is just my opinion though. Like I mentioned some people liked that floater style of play."
599943,jedimaster,2011-07-06 15:56:00,3472,"I am hopeful for kessel. He has the skill, he has the wheels He won't see his full potential if he doesn't learn to play with more grit to create his own chances or have a solid, fast playmaker beside him. I was really hoping for Richards. I think Richards, Kessle, and Grabovsky would have made an amazing first line for the leafs. Maybe we have a chance at drury, He wouldn't be half bad either. Man oh man I gotta stop reading this thread, I have Leafs on the brain and its only the begining of July."
599953,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-06 16:29:00,0,"30 goals is great but when you're on the ice for more goals against than for, what's the point.  he was -20 last year which is very indicative of the fact that he's a one dimensional player with little to no defensive responsiblity.  true marquee players make other people around them better, they don't rely on other players to make them good.   i don't agree in any way that sundin had no heart though.  the guy had heart, scored a lot of clutch goals, and led by example by being at both ends of the rink. i think mats made the players around him better for sure!  he would have been a great leader if the team wasn't full of a rotating cast of retiring hockey players much of the early millenium."
599954,Jigger,2011-07-06 16:30:00,1237,"Ya, i guess Sundin never did get the number of cups that Gilmour, Clarke, Sittler, MacDonald or Roberts did with the Leafs. And here i sat thinking that the leading point getter in Leafs history had to be a great player..."
599958,ryan a harris,2011-07-06 16:36:00,17,"When I was a teen, I remember watching Game 6 in 1993 against the Kings, in LA. Clark scores 3 goals, puts the team on his back to force a game 7. Because of that game Clark became the best leaf in my mind, or should I say my favorite Leaf. Now Sundin was captain of the Swedish team that won gold, he was a great leader for players like Lidstorm, forsberg. Those 2 even mentioned how great of a leader Mats was. Mats was done for in Toronto, because he was traded for the teams captain and fan fav. Most goals, most points(I think as well), but yeah he was no good. In a stretch from 99-02 the leafs had the MOST playoff games played, true no cup, but 4 goods playoff runs. If I recall correctly, Sundin had an emergency route canal, 6 hours in the chair, then played in a playoff game against the Hurrincane`s. Not many of us would do that, then go to work, no less an NHL playoff game. But yeah he had no hart.  I`m a big leaf fan, and I think I have a good handle on reality. They have not done enough yet, but Burke has stuck to his plan, I like what he is doing. A marquee player will not fall into the Leafs lap. Kessel is also done for in Toronto, because of what he was traded for, 2 1st rounders. Kessel is the youngest player in today's game to have 30 goal season in 3 straight years. He may not be the best guy with the media, or even the best team mate. But the guy can score! Every team that wins has a good goal scorer. His talents are needed here, because if not him, who would socre?  Go Leafs Go!"
599980,cjgraham,2011-07-06 17:28:00,104,"The problem with Kessel is he basically has one move and thats top shelf glove side. Goalies have him pegged, and I don't see very many more goals past 30. I hope conally can help but that was truly a desperation move. It will be interesting to see whether Reimer can carry this team in net, but if this is what we have going into the season its going to be another long one of presumably crossed fingers and false hopes."
599982,jedimaster,2011-07-06 17:29:00,3472,"Funny thing about stats.... Ask yourself this. Who has the most wins in a single season for a Toronto Maple leafs goalie. Would you consider him among the best goalies ever? I hardly think so. If you have talent and your on he ice your going to score. I am not saying sundin wasn't good. In fact I said he had good hands. Just was never a great like Clarke, Sittler or Gilmour. He never played with the fire that these guys did. It has nothing to do with where he is from or how many public endoresments he had. He just didn't play with the fire. Imagine if Tucker had the size and skill of Sundin. He no dout logged a tone of minutes and played every power play over the years and of course was bound to get lots of points. In my eyes he just didn't play with the grit, heart and tenacity of the three players that were mentioned."
599988,Jds63,2011-07-06 17:55:00,1365,"I 'll give you the point that ""stats don't mean everything"" but your idea of a guy that plays with heart is based on your comparison to Canadian players , that have a different style of play. Some European players play with heart and grit but may not show it. I guess you would say that Borje Salming didn't play with heart ... When the Leafs traded away Clark and Sundin came over, the world was going to end for the Leafs nation ... Sundin was a pleasure to watch he gave his heart to Toronto over the years. It just sucked the way it ended.  I have been to a fair number of Leafs games,.. LOL (ya call me nuts) but let me tell you something about heart ... I just don't get why Leaf fans are so quiet ... half the time you can hear the blades on the ice , nobody is yelling at the other team , last year i sat in the last row at the ACC and i think i found where the true fans were ... it was louder up there than at ice level I am sure ... get all those corporate   off their BB's out of those front seats and let the true fans have the privelege of cheering for their team"
599991,grimsbylander,2011-07-06 18:06:00,3016,"Singling out players for how they play, or don't play, is a difficult thing. It's the mix of skills that make a team great. Just like us...we all take an assortment of rods out fishing because 8 flipping sticks doesn't do it. That's why GM's are so critical, they have to find that correct mix at the right time, for the right money. IMHO."
599998,jedimaster,2011-07-06 18:18:00,3472,"Grit, tenacity and heart are shown on the ice. I rarely saw that from Sundin. Good skilled hands, lots of ice time, and few other players to score on the team are what lead to his stats. However I would still not put him in the same sentance as Gilmour, clarke, Sittler, roberts etc...... That doesn't mean I think Sundin was a bad player. He was good, but not one of the greatest Leafs."
600028,kickingfrog,2011-07-06 19:20:00,8333,"Another fact about stats. If you are going to use them, you should know how they are derived.  Plus/minus, on its own, is a stat that holds less and less importance to people in, or who know, hockey.  Someone with a negative +/- was not necessarily on the ice for more goals for than against. Skaters receive a minus only when they are on the ice for an even strength goal against or if there is a shorthanded goal against.  Skaters do not receive a plus when they are on the ice for a powerplay goal.  Guys who rack up a large portion of their points on the powerplay will often have a lower then expected plus/minus. Yes, these guys are one demential, but no one wants a powerplay with no punch either.  It is also a stat that favours players on good teams. A mediocre player on a good team will often have a higher plus/minus than a good player on a bad team.  On its own the plus/minus number is often less then useless."
598887,kickingfrog,2011-07-03 02:16:00,8333,"While every player is potentially one hit away from a carear ender, the guys with past concussions are much closer to that edge and jump exponentially closer after every one. It never goes away, unlike most other injuries that players are come back from."
598893,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-03 03:13:00,0,"the connolly signing REEKS of desperation.  9.5 million for 2 seasons?  talk about overpaying! i realize he's being brought in to feed kessel, but the guy got 13 goals last year! you'd think you'd want at least a 20 goal scorer for your top line.  i can't wait to deliver a few million ""i told you so's"" when the burke era ends in failure."
598937,tb4me,2011-07-03 16:26:00,3295,This just in...The Lebda experiment is over!!! who hoo!!!!  Maple Leafs trade D Brett Lebda and F Robert Slaney to Preditors for F Matthew Lombardi and D Cody Franson. I like this just for the record!!
598973,jediangler,2011-07-03 19:11:00,1923,"A bag of pucks and a leaky water bottle for Lebda would have been fair. This was probably the best deal made, in Burke's time at the helm."
598992,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-03 20:14:00,4399,"The GM`s have gone mad again 4.5 million for a guy who is the following; injury prone, never scored 20 goals in a season, managed to top the 50 point total twice!  Erik Cole 4.5 million James Wisnieski 5.5 million  And look at what Dale Tallon did in Florida  I think another lock out is in order!!!"
599015,jediangler,2011-07-03 21:40:00,1923,"Don't forget Markov in Montreal for just under $6 million a year for 3 years.  I don't see how management locking out the players, will affect managements own over spending on the same players."
599017,kickingfrog,2011-07-03 22:01:00,8333, The owners won the last lock-out: 24% salary rollback and a cap tied to revenue. Virtually broke the association. Wonder what will happen if the owners win again.   :rofl2:
599018,Grimace,2011-07-03 22:13:00,2020,I have been very critical of Brian Burke but I really like Cody Franson.  This is a good deal.  Lombardi can centre Kessel when Connelly is injured. :-p
599020,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-03 22:28:00,4399,"I hear ya guys but things are getting out of hand again, I don`t think I would be to far off by saying half of the teams in the league are losing money under this agreement and again these teams can not afford the cap minimum let alone the ceiling. Something as to be done, the NHL is a house of cards waiting to fall!!!"
599023,kickingfrog,2011-07-03 22:47:00,8333,"It is a house that the owners have built with the help of the count. They want a free market for themselves but do not allow it for the players.  You are right the cap floor does not work for many teams, these are the same teams that the lock-out was for in the first place (nice work betmen). I'd love to see 6-8 teams disappear, but don't expect to see it."
599024,Grimace,2011-07-03 22:47:00,2020,Contraction.  Get rid of the weak teams. The teams that can afford it can play.  A 20 team NHL would be perfect.  The hockey would be better as the teams would have more talent.
599034,ryan a harris,2011-07-03 23:09:00,17,"Connolly was one of the top 5 center free agents available this summer. Yeah at 4.5 per season he is overpaid, but so many other players are also overpaid. He has some decent skill that may work well with kessel, he is a passer first, hence the lack of a 20 goal season to date. He has always played in a defence minded system in Buffalo, some free wheeling will do his numbers some good. The Leafs power play needed a player of this type of skill to help it out. Health IS a concern, but any player at any time could be out.  I don't know much about this Franson, but I'm sure he is better than Lebda. The leafs Defence seems to be getting crowded now, I wonder if Burke will be looking to try to move 1 or 2 more of them before the season starts. Or this could just mean some healthy competition in training camp, then try to move the odd man out.......  I for one am glad the leafs did not sign Richards to the type of contract he got. I know Burke has signed a few guys over what they should be paid, but he has yet to handcuff the team with a long term deal over 6 million per season. Over paying for a free agent is really the way to beat out the other teams who are also trying to sign the same player. We would all do the same thing if we had the ability to be ""free agents"""
599221,jedimaster,2011-07-04 14:31:00,3472,Burke is too much of a whimp to send an offer sheet to Stamkos. Would be nice but its never going to happen. I heard Tampa's last offer is 5 year 37.5Leafs should send in an 5 year 50 mil
599224,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-04 14:42:00,0,"the problem is nobody wants to play in toronto.  it's got nothing to do with money either because the leafs have plenty of it. it's got everything to do with bad ownership, obnoxious media, and the fact that regular fans can't afford to take their kids to games.  i think toronto was voted 5th last by the NHLPA for cities the players would like to play in.  for such a financially successful and historical franchise, i would find that unacceptable if i were any more than a closet leafs fan.  problem is, leaf nation just keeps on buying hats, paying 300 dollars to see A GAME, and the cycle continues."

599281,Headhunter,2011-07-04 19:09:00,5703,"You know Doc, you're exactly right. But here is the real head scratcher for me... Toronto is arguably the centre of the hockey universe. This market has not had a marquee player since Gilmour... and what I mean by that is the following... Hockey in this town is a religion. High profile elite players could make a fortune with endorsements in this town... so after being grossly over paid by their hockey salaries, they could then augment their income, through various product endorsements... remember Gilmour in the cow pants! The right personality could own this town, but it seems to me that the players are simply happy to get their pay and be done with any extra activities... The Toronto market is a license to print money for the right player. There seems to be no will amoung players to take advantage of it! and the current roster lacks one thing... a marquee player! LOL HH"
599283,Grimace,2011-07-04 19:23:00,2020,If they get a right mix of young players that get the team to a respectable level of competition then players will once again want to come  here.  Toronto is the best place to play on a winning team and the worst place to play on a losing team.  It wasn't long ago the Yankees were in the same boat.  They bought there way out of it.  You can't do that in hockey.  Edit : spelling.  Bloody iPhone auto correct.

599605,ehg,2011-07-05 17:17:00,2666,Wasn't Mats Sundin considered a marquee player...does anyone remember him? I remember during the 2002 Winter Olympics he was one of the more dominant players in the world. Connolly doesn't even come close to Sundin. More mediocrity for the center of the hockey universe....

599637,jedimaster,2011-07-05 19:03:00,3472,"Its very difficult to actually call Sundin a Marque player. Just because he was the best on the team doens't mean he is all that great. I know of very few people who actually liked Sundin and thought of him as a Marque player. I never did. The only player that shows any glimour of hope is Reimer. Think of all the great players that the leafs have had a shot at but fell short or never stepped up to bat. Lindros, Gretzky, Messier, Richards, Iginla the list goes on. Instead the Leafs are happy with having one player better than the rest of bums. Lets face it te leafs have 1 player that could play top line on any other team. Thats kessle, and he is a supporting character. he can't stand on his own. You could make an argument for Grabovski, but thats a bit of a stretch. The young talent is there though for the 2,3 and 4 lines. But we are still missing the superstar the fans deserve."
599640,Headhunter,2011-07-05 19:14:00,5703,"I certainly didn't forget Matts! He was a skill player, but not a marquee player in that he did not take advantage of his position in this market, outside of his on ice performance... and that was the point of my post. The last Leaf to take advantage of all that this hockey mecca can offer was Gilmour... A true marquee player will have the team following him and will grab any and all endorsement money available... who do the Leafs have that could pull that off? Kessel would rather not speak to anyone, much less take endorsement money and have to actually interact with the public... All I'm saying is that there is an opportunity here that no one is either considering or taking advantage of... and the dollars available are staggering! HH"
598647,cjgraham,2011-07-02 03:41:00,104,Well with the first day of free agency Burke was no where to be seen. I thought Burkie said he was gonna be active early with all this right out of the gate talk. Then it donned on me. He doesn't celebrate till July 4th. Us Leafs fans will have to wait a few more days till Burke will have a few more americans signed to celebrate their 235th year of independence.  Go Leafs Go.

598719,tb4me,2011-07-02 14:28:00,3295,I dont see why everyone has their panties in a bunch over Richards... He is 31 and wants a 10 year deal. 25 mill for the first 2 years then spread out from there. He also has had some concussion problems.. Then there is Stamkos...21 years old top 3 in the world. in 10 years he is still only 31. The only down side to Stamkos is he is UFA..That means he will cost us 4 first round picks right off the top. Mind you he has no concussion issues..If he is as good as he has been then our pics will be 15th or higher..Should be interesting to see what Burkie does..Yes Burke was in Kandahar with our (Canadian) troops  . He sent Fletch and Noonis to meet with Richards. I do hear there is an offer sheet out to Stamkos. I just love this time of the year....GO LEAFS GO!!!
598721,kickingfrog,2011-07-02 14:44:00,8333,"As above, Richards scares me for the term he wants given his health and the up and down years he has had. He will most likely help any team that he joins, but they may find themselves saddled with a contract that really hinders them down the road."
598774,misfish,2011-07-02 19:37:00,29133,"Atleat one move makes me happy. Sha scares me, is gone."
598775,kickingfrog,2011-07-02 19:37:00,8333,$60 million for 9 years to be in NYC. Torts is never gonna last that long. When does training camp open?
598795,Rod Caster,2011-07-02 21:06:00,5784,If Connelly stays healthy for 82gms he'll get the leafs 60-70pts... in 2008-09 he was one of the best players to watch on Buffalo and even during his short seasons he was getting 0.8 pts/game. Good pickup.  
598798,jediangler,2011-07-02 21:22:00,1923,It'll take Connolly 2 years to play 82 games for the Leafs. Not a truculant Burkie player for sure.
598818,Grimace,2011-07-02 22:50:00,2020,Connelly has had a headache for 12 years.  He will play no more than 50 games.  He can't take the ice time that a first liner needs to play.  He is a sitting duck.  I hope Burke throws out a 10 for 10 to Stamkos just to watch Yzerman squirm. Lol. But he won't.
598834,Rizzo,2011-07-02 23:17:00,4754," ...that may the biggest ""if"" I've ever seen. Has he even played anything close to a full season the last 10 years?"
598847,uglyfish,2011-07-03 00:02:00,981,"Burke doesn't like to step on toes and make offers to RFA's. Does no one remember how pissed he got when kevin lowe snuck in and scooped up dustin penner from anaheim?  I'd love to see stamkos in a leafs jersey, but its a huge price to pay for a one way player. Not only the money he will command but the higher the price, the more picks the leafs give tampa in compensation.  Richards only missed like 10 games with a concussion if I'm correct? Connolly has had injury issues too, but he's a solid playmaker that could be a big point producer with the leafs.  Richards could flop in the big apple, and I kinda see him having a poor season."
598850,Rod Caster,2011-07-03 00:09:00,5784,"  He's played over 60 games in 7 of the last 11 seasons and four full seasons. Definitly injury prone, but he's not too far gone yet."
598860,Rizzo,2011-07-03 00:43:00,4754,"I stand corrected. When I think Connelly I think of skilled player that averages 50 games a year...although maybe I'm not too far off. What did he play in those other 4 seasons, may bring his average down close to 50"
598862,misfish,2011-07-03 00:51:00,29133," If Stamkos was a real/true player,he would play for his home team.Then again,it,s all about the money,not about the true love of the sport/game . Crazy dollars for players over years. Jager hit the jackpot again."
598863,Rod Caster,2011-07-03 00:53:00,5784," Out of 820 potential games (10 seasons) he's played 627 with 395pts. His first four years were his healthiest.. Not a good trend, 68 games/42pts last season... He needs to have a better season to be worth over 4.5 mill.  He doesn't have the best playoff stats, but neither do the leafs. Hehe."
598864,Rizzo,2011-07-03 00:54:00,4754," pulled this quote from a different article. Misses nearly half the games based on the last 7 seasons. He is a ""50 games a season guy"" apparently. If he's played a lot the last few years I hope he can keep it up. A healthy Connolly can certainly help the Leafs, I'm just not convinced there is such a thing as a healthy Tim Connolly"
598868,Grimace,2011-07-03 00:59:00,2020," Something to note Brian.  I am sure Steven Stamkos has built a rapport and friendship with Steve Yzerman. It would be about the money if he left quite frankly.  Now if he did leave for ridiculous money, I am sure the Markham boy would love to play for the Leafs. Yzerman would get 4 first rounders that maybe 2 make it and it's a coin flip on how good they become.  That's why it is not going to happen. Burke won't offer and Yzerman would never let Stamkos go.  The only reason I stated I would like to see Burke offer 10 for 10 is to watch Yzerman squirm then match it then sell off his defense.  Lol."
598869,Rizzo,2011-07-03 01:02:00,4754,"did some more reading - the biggest concern I would have is the concussions - apparently this hasn't been an issue the past few years.Its been all kinds of other fluky type things. Thats good news for the Leafs, hopefully he won't be snake bitten the next two seasons!"
598871,Rod Caster,2011-07-03 01:13:00,5784," well sure... if you manipulate the stats. He's played ten seasons and averages 62 games/season... sidney crosby is at 68 games/season (two completely different players of course). This is from NHL.com stats. Hopefully he gets 70+ games this year, he could be Kessels assist man."
598873,Rizzo,2011-07-03 01:19:00,4754," I wouldn't call it manipulating the stats, I'd call it looking at recent history"
598876,Rizzo,2011-07-03 01:27:00,4754,"...although if you want to get really recent (last 2 seasons) he's averaged 70 games a season! Gotta love stats, you can use them to prove whatever point you want (thats the one thing I took away from University)"
598878,Rod Caster,2011-07-03 01:33:00,5784, That's puts him in the 70th percentile  The Avs paid a fortune for Valamov and signed Giguere. Now there is an injury prone tandem.
