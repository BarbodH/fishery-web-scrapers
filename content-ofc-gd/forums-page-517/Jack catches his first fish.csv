Bly and Ryan.....i was going to call this thread ""On the shoulders of giants"" refering to Sidney and Averie.....i was thinking of them the whole time leading up to the moment jack got his first fish.   LOL...HTMH.....Mynnow is not a strange English accent its just what Jack has called Minnows since he decided he wanted to talk."

596183,limeyangler,2011-06-24 12:18:00,5204,"Hi all,  Jack came out in the boat with mum and me this evening. I took us to a lake that i know holds lots of perch with the hope that a bobber set up might get jack his first fish.  The lake is more of a 'puddle' by the side of the highway...but very sheltered with easy access.  Jack got his first fish ever in the boat after first losing a pike after a line stripping battle.     <iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IvTlvBAEySg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>              "
