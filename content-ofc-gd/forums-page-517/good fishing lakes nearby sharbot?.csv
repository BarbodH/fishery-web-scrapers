I am asking this because I aware that the Sharbot lake is in a provincial park, the fish in that lake might be ""well trained"" by your pro guys who have been there before.  So in case I do not have a good luck in Sharbot, I would then willing to try any lake within 50km of Sharbot park.  Any input would be highly appreciated."

After that you have to fish deep for Walleye. There is Bass, Pike, and a few Muskie there, but we don't target them. I love the Lake early 85% crown land. no boaters or personal water crafters to bug you, summer could be a different story. Lots of structure, watch the rocks."
