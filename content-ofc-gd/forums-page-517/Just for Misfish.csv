Of course I loves ya darling You're a bloody top notch bird And when I say yer gorgeous I means every single word  So yer arse is on the big side I don't mind a bit of flab It means that when I'm ready There's somethin there to grab  So yer belly isn't flat no more I tell ya, I don't care So long as when I cuddle ya I can get my arms round dere   I'm tellin ya the truth now I never tells ya lies I think its very sexy Dat you've got dimples on yer thighs  I swear on me grannies grave From the moment that we met I thought you was as good as I was ever gonna get  No matter what you look like I'll always love ya dear Now shut up while the hockey's on And get me a nudder beer.   Doesnâ€™t it just bring a tear to the eye?"
