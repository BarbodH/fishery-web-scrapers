Has anyone used the Vinyl Magnets and if so how well do they stay on? Not looking to buy them and have them just blow off and end up at the bottom of the lake.  Also if anyone has a local GTA supplier, I would appreciate the contact as I would prefer to order Decals/Magnets locally.  Thanks"

I would think decals are the way to go, one decent wave would probably dislodge even a strong magnet. If you apply the decal with some soapy water and a squeegie, you can position it easily and they come off with a hairdryer to soften the adhesive without making a mess or taking the finish off (used this method on an ally and fibreglass racing car loads of times)"
