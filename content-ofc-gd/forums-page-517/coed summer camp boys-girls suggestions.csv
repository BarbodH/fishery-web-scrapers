599155,bow slayer,2011-07-04 04:26:00,1074,Looking for a reasonably priced(600/wk) summer camp for my 13 year old daughter and a couple of her friends. Would like to find one in the Muskoka area but will consider anywhere in central/near north or karwarthas. Looking for a tradition summer camp non faith based. Looking to book for a week only. Most I have been able to find are faith based or require 2 week or more stay. Anyone have any knowledge of one please pass on the info .thanks

599215,NAW,2011-07-04 14:04:00,4022,I did some work at Camp Manitou. http://www.manitoucamp.com/  Seems like a decent place.  My buddies uncle runs the place.   Another old friend of mine runs a place called Camp Muskoka. http://campmuskoka.com/summer-camp/  I've never been to Camp Muskoka before.  Worth looking into though.

Learned lots of sports and kept busy, also met lots of cool people. there wakeboard/ski program is one of the best, kept me wanting to come back."

One of my Board members attended throughout her childhood and she says it changed her life. I attended the funeral of the owner last year and I was amazed at the hundreds of people that paid tribute to Louis. Many were kids that have attended over the years that it has operated. I believe they will continue to use Louis' philosophy as they move forward. Check it out on the web for all the activities that they provided. They developed a recording artist out of one of the campers, many successful business people and I believe the guy that is managing the camp now was a lifelong camper."
