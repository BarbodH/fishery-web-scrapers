Seems when I got un-geared at the truck I neglected to put my vest in.  Went back this morning and it's gone. My hopes is that someone on here may have spotted it and picked it up. A long shot indeed, but I'm an optimist. Does have my license in the pocket, so I'd really like to locate it. Thanks in advance!  Sorry, I was parked at the woodline just East of Sims Lock Road, so it was probably on the gravel there."

I went up last night, and found one of my streamers on the road, so someone found it and dumped the fly box. Put up a sign with the phone number, but I'm not holding my breath.... Oh well, looks like I got get a new vest this weekend. Cheers!!!!"
