Most of the fish this season were taken on jerkbaits, Strike Zone Swammers and trolling a shallow invader.               Crazy looking tiger muskie      I've been lucky enough to fish every day since opener even if just for a few hours.  I fished 2 tournaments in one day on wednesday one from 7-3 on Couchiching where I finished 5th on thwe windiest day I can ever remember fishing in.  From 5-9 we had a 15 boat tournament on Cooks Bay that we were able to win despite the wind.  We've done a few lakes for bass so far and our best success has come dropshotting Slammers and flipping jigs to shoreline structure                "
