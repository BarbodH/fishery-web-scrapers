599855,n8tivebigguy,2011-07-06 05:12:00,30,I was just wondering if anyone fished at smiths mill pond? I talked to a fellow fisherman that said it was a good place to try but i can't find any info in the regs for that body of water?   So thanks for any info.
599994,cuzza,2011-07-06 18:10:00,467,If there's nothing specific in the regs then the general rules apply for limits etc. specific bodies of water are only mentioned if there are exceptions. Access is a different matter.  I haven't fished there but perhaps head down there for a look and chat to anyone fishing? Have rod in the car if it looks good.
