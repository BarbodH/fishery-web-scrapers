362025,scottydog,2009-07-14 15:30:00,10,Hi all first time user  and first post. Just wondering if anyone can point me to a good spot to fish. I have riggers for salmon/trout but if it's not a good time than what area for walleye bass  or pike. I'm not looking for your best spots just general areas. It will be first time up there. I'm moving a buddy early tomorrow and might as well bring the boat. Lol

Also, if you plan on sticking around the site for a while, I would recommend making a Introduction topic, where you're from, what you fish for, etc... and throw in a couple pics, we eat pics up on this site, haha  Happy Fish'n"
362106,scottydog,2009-07-14 18:25:00,10,Thanks for the info. My name is Scott Cunningham I do plan on staying around for a while. While I'm not very good around a computer I will try and post if I get the chance to go fishing. It takes me a while to type all this in one letter at a time. As for pictures I don't have a digital camera nor would I know where to begin to put a picture on this site. I just got remarried in June of 08 and my fishing time has been cut into a tenth of what it was. I have 4 girls from 19 to 10 years old.  I work 80 hours a week and bought a fixer upper Duh. I went ice fishing 3 times for the year on lake simcoe. I fish for everything except Muskie. My favourite fish is Steelhead/walleye but I really just love to fish and be out there on the water. This letter took me about a half hour to type but I think I'm getting better already. Ha Ha.

362128,bigbuck,2009-07-14 19:03:00,2449,"Welcome!! Up that way, you could fish Penetang Harbour or you could head up north to Beausoleil Bay in between Beausoleil Island and Roberts Island but you would need a good map marking the rocks and shoals of which there are a lot, there are tons of props and lower ends sitting on the bottom of Georgian Bay."
