361585,EC1,2009-07-13 17:11:00,930,"Hi everyone! Just wanted to ask people for a few topwater colours I should be trying within the next few days.  I currently am really liking the black top and golden bottom, but the golden paint in the bottom of my topwater is absolutely torn apart, and I'm noticing less bites on the unpainted silver bottom.  Thanks for any suggestions in advance!"
361588,Raf,2009-07-13 17:22:00,3495,when it comes to topwater colour really dosen't matter as long as it's black
361592,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-13 17:32:00,10439,  Yep
361594,backbay,2009-07-13 17:35:00,773,"haha, that's funny, 'cause white works for me!"
361597,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-13 17:46:00,3761,I like the frog pattern for both popers and slop frogs.
361602,Hooked,2009-07-13 17:52:00,891,"As long as the belly colour is either black, white, or chartruese, it'll work.  Top end colour is just for us fisherman to look at and say that's pertty."
361620,danbo,2009-07-13 18:26:00,2646,Dark day/night I choose Black. Bright day I choose white or yellow.
361752,cuillerierk,2009-07-13 23:08:00,32,Black or white...     If they don't bite on one they'll usually bit on the other.  Which is why I always buy one of each. Black usually offers the best contrast.
361766,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 23:22:00,73,its all about contrast and not colour.. dark bottom white top...
361845,BillM,2009-07-14 01:31:00,17367,I've tossed chrome bottomed baits at night and caught fish....  I've tossed black baits on bluebird days and caught fish.  Colour when it comes to topwater isn't a very important factor if you ask me..    I'd be looking at size and lure action over colour..  But what do I know
361876,EC1,2009-07-14 02:33:00,930,"thanks for all the input guys! The point that only the bottom matters is probably true, since they're only looking up and seeing the bottom + the hooks."
361887,WeedLine,2009-07-14 02:54:00,322,"I think the best colours are the ones that you have confidence in. Every colour will catch fish silver,black,white,yellow, perch patterns, firetiger, etc. If you think it will work, it will just keep the lure in the water."
361899,cram,2009-07-14 03:27:00,1733,"all of mine are yellow, orange, or black.  As others have said, i don't *think* it matters but sometimes wonder if contrast along the side might matter for lures that roll a bit....ie. zara spooks, crazy crawlers, others that might flash their sides."
