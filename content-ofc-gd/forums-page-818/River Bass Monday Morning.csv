Total Hours Fishing - 3  Total Fish Landed - 4 / 3 smallies and 1 rock bass  Largest Fish 14""  Today was the first time I hit the Grand this year that I didn't see any Gar Pike surfacing. Still haven't hooked into one yet.  Also the small pickerel that we're biting earlier in the season haven't been biting on my last 2 outings. Earlier in the year they would bite mid-day but now very early morning or late late evening is only producing."
