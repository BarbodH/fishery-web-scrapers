(good thing he knows how to operate the tripod and camera timer)   very happy for him, as he has been working to get one for a while now!  not easy to net your own fish like that.  So here is one thing I came across while I was not fishing... did she deserve it? Did he deserve it? Should we not even tak about it? :-) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJLTi0L3mPM"
