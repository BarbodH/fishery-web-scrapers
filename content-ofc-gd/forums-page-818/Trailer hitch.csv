Good chance he ended up doin' some unintended off roadin' somewhere.  Check the 'hills' in the background.  Howja like to meet this rig on a two-lane road....coming down the mountain in your direction...?    She's hitched up and r eady to roll!!  Amazin' how the extra weight  smoothes out the ride..  Needed to air up the rear tires a bit ('bout 160 psi).   Added some super heavy-duty chain for extra support on the tailgate, (note the 'Heavy-Duty 'S' hooks to attach the chain) Also paid-up for some BIG          Number 5/16 sheet metal screws to attach the Reese hitch frame to the tailgate (see 'em there?  one on each side...) and two more through the carpet into the floor pan inside.... Yep, probably overkill, but didn't want the possibility of having an axerdent.   Most of the time was spent on the front porch whittling down that MASSIVE solid pine 4x4  to fit precisely down into the hole in the ball mount receiver. Note also - The 14'x14' piece of 3/8' plywood on the underside of the tailgate to distribute the load more evenly and beef up that tailgate support . 'A MAN CAN'T BE TOO SAFE'...!!  They are out there, folks... and they vote... and they reproduce !"
