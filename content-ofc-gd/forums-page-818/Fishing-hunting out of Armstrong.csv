Lots of fly'in lakes from what I here.  Nipigon, and Wabakimi Prov. Park seem like perfect fishing spots to me.  I also hunt.  Does anyone know if there's a season for woodland Caribou in the Armstrong area?  I would imagine the moose/partridge hunting is top dollar aswell.   Anyone been there??  Comments??  Thanks,"

I don't, however, believe there is a season for caribou in Ontario (correct me if Im wrong here). I did some aerial survey work a few years ago in the hudson bay area to assess the population and feasibility of a sport hunt....never heard what came of our counts."
