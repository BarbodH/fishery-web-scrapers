Glad I heard it from him and not on the news!  TB"

I do not have kids, but I cannot imagine the stress that you would have been under to hear it on the news and not know who.  Hearing your son's voice tell you must have been a huge comfort factor.  Albiet you probably stressed about it still."
361975,tinbanger,2009-07-14 13:16:00,1028,actually hadn't heard about it till Matt called last night. Whew   TB
361990,grt1,2009-07-14 13:50:00,638,"I heard this on the news a few days ago and remembered seeing a post on here of someone getting their ""dream job"" at Totem resort for the summer.  I did a search and saw that Pikie was only 18 from Barrie, it kind of set my mind at rest, since the fellow who drown was 23 and from St Catherines. It is still sad though, the Lake of the Woods is pretty treacherous during storms and there are still unmarked reefs out there.  Evidently this fellow didn't turn up for work and the lodge owners called the OPP and reported him missing. they found his boat floating and him on the shore."
