361720,BillM,2009-07-13 21:56:00,17367,"Love my custom 3 piece 13' Loomis IM6 float rod..  Also like my 13'6 GL3  However, I wouldn't trade my Avid baitcaster for anything, absolutely love it...  I also love my 8' Shimano Compre muskie stick also, lol"
361753,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 23:11:00,73,the thing about shimano though... there more of a reel companie but i have yet to see them come up to par with their rods... i had a shimano cumara broke and sent it 3 times in 3 weeks(it was spinning). i LOVE my cumara 6'8 baitcaster though. easily comparable to a steez or loomis.

361838,CLofchik,2009-07-14 01:23:00,854," Shimano now owns & distributes Loomis. Yes, quality has suffered.   Go with St.Croix, though for the money Fenwick HMX's are a heck of a rod."
361842,BillM,2009-07-14 01:28:00,17367,  No complaints on my Compre yet... For the price and the lifetime warranty you can't beat it in my opinion.
361867,bucktail,2009-07-14 02:07:00,1857,MNy Loomis cranckbait casting and dropshot spinning aremy too fav rods. Have had problems twice with the ferule on 2 St Croixs... they replaced both of them no hassle. My crucials are bullet proof as well. Dont think you can go wrong with either of the three...... Love my Loomis tho
362000,lovemyprovince,2009-07-14 14:08:00,73,  yea the fenwicks are great!! even the highlander2 from canadian tire is great 4 value! very light i think 3.5 oz.. for 79.99 and the hmg are great to i used to have a ultra lite but it got stolen...  but il stick with my croix's amazing for money.  shimano owns loomis now.....better warranty but crappy service.. shimano are like car salespeople great when you buy the rod but the'' i dont give a crap'' after it broke....
362076,chinookhunter,2009-07-14 17:27:00,68,st croix all the way have been using them for years . never let me down and i have caught some huge fish on them.
