They came up with a topic which is the ""#1 Sport to Kill You"". So they went through different sports where death may happen which were Boxing-Football & Sky Diving and these three sports in 2003 had fewer deaths combined 167 in the USA  than Fishing (Boating) do not remember the total of deaths for Fishing (Boating) although fishing/boating have alot more particpants than those three other sports.  Anyways they listed the three most common causes of death which were :  #1  Hitting submerged/floating objects with fibreglass boats at high speeds or any speed. #2  Boat deaths in 2003 had 68% due to drownings with a main cause due to hypothermia. #3  Boat deaths in 2003 had 31% attributed to alcohol related accidents.  All three causes could be used for one death but it was interesting to watch but was only a five minute or so clip so it was not super in depth with details but more for entertainment value due to the nature of the show....."
