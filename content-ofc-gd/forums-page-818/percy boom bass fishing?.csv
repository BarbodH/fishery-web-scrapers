361571,shorty99,2009-07-13 16:41:00,2,just wondering if anyone has fished this section of the trent and how the bass fishing is....is there a launch area below cambellford?
361589,msp,2009-07-13 17:26:00,1336,The fishing is like any other Kawartha lake in the area. The bass fishing can be good at times but it can also have its tough moments. Some pretty big musky have been caught there in the past.Good luck. The public launch is in Percy Boom.
