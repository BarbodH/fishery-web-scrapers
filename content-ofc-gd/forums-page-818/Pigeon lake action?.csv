361573,shorty99,2009-07-13 16:48:00,2,Just wondering how the fishing has been for bass as of late....i've heard its been a really slow bite...has anyone been getting on em at all out there as of late??? Seems this weather is throwing them off.

361757,Newfieman,2009-07-13 23:16:00,19,I was fishing there on the weekend for walleye and the fish were shut down.  I think it had something to do with the cold front.
