361718,Burning Babies,2009-07-13 21:53:00,150,"Not to mention the very adds they publish (for the Fat DTs anyway) very explicitly instruct you to use that technique.  I normally side with manufacturers on wear-and-tear issues, but this seems exceptional.  On the other hand, I see no reason to be upset about receiving your original lure back.  If you're not already parting out your old baits for spare parts, you've got more money than me."

361895,Jonny,2009-07-14 03:16:00,1380," What you did sounds like something I would have done (if I didn't take it back to the retail store first), and my reaction would have been a long the same lines.  Thanks for posting your problem. I guess these lures aren't what they're cranked up to be (especially if sponsored fishermen use them in exactly the way you did). It'll make me think twice about Rapala's and seriously consider the alternatives. I wouldn't like to get that kind of response either, if I had taken the trouble to ship the lure back to them and write a letter to go with it. (I doubt many people would do that.)  Take some comfort in the fact that you did them some damage here (those that disagree with you notwithstanding). A company that's big enough not to care about losing your business is also big enough to replace your lure at pennies of cost to them. All it takes is the right attitude."

I open up a brand new package which was not damaged etc etc ...First cast the popper kept going for miles the only thing left on my line was the eyelet which pulled right out of the body...  The next day I went out and bought 6 more just in case it happened again....

We smack em on rocks we snag em on rocks every fish that bites it starts the lure on it's inevitable decline where one day it will be retired to the wall of lures in your garage when we unhook it from a fish's mouth, we add some stress damage to it, sometimes less, sometimes more. some lures beat themselves up simply by being retrieved in the water by it's own hooks..  Some lures lasts long, some dont but personally I dont worry about lures breaking..  rods, reels, electronics.. different story."

361565,Governator,2009-07-13 16:29:00,879,"I think hitting the lip off rocks purposely cast after cast for 2hrs could definitely weaken most baits, it's too bad yours took the worst of it.  I understand the technique but I wouldn't use my expensive baits for it.  Every contact a lure makes against structure is different which can cause damanage.  It's a risk you take and a company can't be held responsible for that.  At the same time, I'm a little surprised they didn't just put a new one in the box for you which costs them probably $0.25.  Next time buy extended warrently lol"
361566,ciceri,2009-07-13 16:30:00,535,"I break the lips off lures all the time from slapping them off the water to get weeds off, or sometimes just from use."
361569,bigfish1965,2009-07-13 16:39:00,3382,"Hmm....well I for one would not be happy. Smashing my Rebel Fastracs off the bottom is my favourite walleye catching method. Sure dragging them through the zebra mussels eventually wears down the plastic and messes the lure up, but THAT MUCH I expect. I've hauled out everything on those lures and never had a lip separate. Sure I hate the hooks they use, but thats an easy fix. I do not think that running a deep diving crankbait into the rocks is not beyond expected usage and should be tested for and made part of the products standards. I have not had any of my older Rapalas come apart for any reason...but I will stay away from the DT's since this seems to be an issue that is common."
361599,ozaibak1,2009-07-13 17:49:00,401,"Looking for another crankbait company even remotely close to the workmanship and reliability of Rapala?? Good luck, tell us when you've found one!"
361610,highdrifter,2009-07-13 18:02:00,2534,"Yep.... sounds familiar.  I've had brand new out of the box raps break on the first cast.  Lure goes a country mile and all you're left standing with is a lip with a slip ring!!  Your technique does not sound all that careless either.  You'd expect that a bait like a DT is meant to be worked with that sort of intended application.  And that's just the thing.  I've got a collection of cracked and broken baits from Rapala, mostly plastic.  Not all of them broken as a result of shooting them on hard surfaces.  The X-raps are awesome baits, but let's face it, they're not indestructible.   One hard hit from a good northern and they're toast.  I'd be tickled pink if I was in your shoes dude.  If there was no visible wear and tear on the bait and the lip was just seperated from the body, I'd say that counts as a defect in workmanship.  Sounds like you just got unlucky and some disgruntled employee was having a bad day.  I say take it back to Canadian Tire or Walmart...  It's their policy to replace product... even lures.  They may just honour your return even without a receipt.  cheers HD"

361640,CLofchik,2009-07-13 19:21:00,854,"Weeeeeeee...........  Oh we're not even talking Lucky Craft here:  Salmo Bomber Cordell Matzuo Grandma Baits Hell even Bass Pro's XPS line are putting out better cranks than Rapala nowadays.  The new made in Vietnam & China and assembled in Estonia plastic Rapala's are JUNK!  Not just worse than they used to be, they're JUNK!  Just from my own box, I have half a dozen of these XRaps that are useless now, but this one is what really turned me on Rapala.  And yes I got the same form letter as the OP.  See that chip, that's from a 25"" pike, the only fish landed by this lure.  A not even 5lb pike flexed their cheap arse plastic so bad it made that large a chip and it cracked on the seam between halves, letting water into the lure and making it unusable.    Well, just let it dry out and patch it.  See that's what I was going to do, only the weights & rattles inside the lure are made of MILD STEEL.  Who the heck puts MILD STEEL in anything designed to be immersed in water?  A cheap crap company, that's who.  The whole thing is full of rust internally, sticking all the weight in the back which kinda ruins the whole ""suspending"" deal and it runs in the water like crap.  Junk.      All that after one fish.  Rapala's are now junk selling at an inflated premium price.  Then there's the J13 that had the rear hook pull out.  Again a new plastic lure, yes even the old standards like the Floating, Jointeds & Husky minnows that used to be made from balsa are now all being made by cheap Asian plastic companies and badged as Rapala's.  Junk.  Rapala's are now junk, get over it and try a Salmo.  Now compare the junk Rapala's (have I used JUNK enough?) to this, the king of longevity in my box(es), the ol' standard hollow BRASS Canadian Wiggler that hasn't changed (thankfully) for eons.  Brass?  In a lure half the price of a Rapala?  Nah, can't be!  Landed well over a hundred Kings, faithfully retired with honours after a long service.  "

361654,solopaddler,2009-07-13 19:59:00,8605,Over the years I've busted countless Rapalas and other lures in a variety of different ways. Never once has it ever crossed my mind to send a broken lure back to the company with a letter LOL! Each to their own but there's no way I'd ever cut it as customer service rep. I'd be telling everybody to suck it up and get lost. They're generally great lures but not indestructable.  If you must bounce lures off the bottom try a Luhr Jensen Rock Walker. That's what they're made for....
361661,chinookhunter,2009-07-13 20:17:00,68,I loose and break lures all the time and it is always my fault. How do you think smashing a lure on rocks is there fault for it breaking?
361679,Billy Bob,2009-07-13 20:41:00,5865,"I'm with the original poster here.......that lure should of been replaced with a apology letter included from Rapala....OR they should stop Al Linder, Dan Sura, Jim Linder, etc......... from teaching the very same technique of bouncing RAPALA'S off the bottom while bass and walleye fishing. I must have seen at least 3 or 4 of Linder's Angling Adventure TV show as he promoted his biggest sponsor RAPALA bouncing RAPALA'S off the bottom."
361684,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-13 20:45:00,0,"so u run the bill of the lure into rocks and the bottom and you are surprised it broke? i think maybe rapala could have replaced it, but if you are going to run a crankbait repeatedly into obstructions you are either going to snag it or break it...  if you want an omellete you gotta crack a few eggs first!"

361702,fishnpro,2009-07-13 21:17:00,93,The DT6 is one of the weakest rapalas I've ever used. I bought two of them and both of them broke. One broke right in half after bumping some rocks on a flat and the other one separated at the bill just like yours. I'm my honest opinion I think there are way better lure manufacturers out there.
361703,misfish,2009-07-13 21:20:00,29133," Thats going to be a lot of collecting.  As for the lucky craft lures,I had one bust on me.Maybe caught three fish on it,til the wire braid in the body snapped.I wasnt pleased,but crap happens.BTW worth3x what your sobbering about.  Now to your post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   All Im going to say is, when you watch these fishing shows, they show knocking off the rocks and sand.Creates strikes.  Heres my point.  The fishermen show guys, are sponsored by the lure maker right? So if they are doing this,and the manufacture sees this(Im sure they do) Then why not replace it. We are being told by the ""PRO"" to do this.  JMO here."

As for being blown off rapala isn't under any obligation to replace a lure that you broke, and as for customer care, ifr rapala gave lures away to everyone who broke it and complained that just opens the door to rusty hooks snags lost lures ect how long would they be in business?

361467,crappieperchhunter,2009-07-13 13:46:00,2582, Exactly what I was thinking.  They deemed it neglect...and rightfully so...and refused to pay for it and returned your lure. I don't see that Rapala has done anything wrong here. Just my 2 cents.

As far as them sending the lure back to you, they did good!... you probably didn't state in your note to them to dispose of it if it couldn't be replaced... and they saved you from contacting them if you did want it back, you can reuse the hooks and split rings on that lure... or try gluing it back together yourself!"
361473,markiemark70,2009-07-13 13:58:00,158,"If the package did not say ""Rock crashing Rapala"" or ""able to withstand any kind of abuse"" then you really have no case.

Getting a letter from them explaining the same thing wouldn't have been any different, except that you'd be short one lure you can potentially repair yourself.  Sure, if they were going to send a lure, why not a new one...but I doubt that the place you sent your lure to even has new ones lying around.  Easier for them to give you your lure back....besides...damaged lures like that that get fixed up with your own creativity and ingenuity (ie. crazy glue)  often make amazing comebacks with big fish. But, your story illustrates how we are all different.  I would've sent an email asking them if it'd be worth sending in for a replacement..got my answer, and busted out the crazy glue.

I know that other companies have sent out freebies, packages of lures with more than just what the guy complained about....so yes, you received some crappy service  but when it comes down to it, is customer service worth that much to you? or is having a lure that's proven to catch fish worth sucking it up?  keep the broken lure...if you break more complain again....might get luckier second time around..."

I also agree that these things should be able to take some abuse aside from just swimming them suspended through the water column.  Im on the fence with this one i guess.......i think rapala handled it as i would expect.

I think they can tell when a lure has been ""damaged in use"" and ""not defective"".  I see guys on the water smack their lures against the water surface when they have weeds on them. Doing stuff like that may weaken a lure. I'm not saying you did that, but lures do get weakened from hitting rocks, etc. Stuff happens so quickly on the water, you may have done something to it and not realised it.  They are expensive but mailing them a lure back doesn't entitle you to a new one. If everyone sent them back lures that broke during use, they might be bankrupt.  Dirk"
361519,farsider,2009-07-13 15:22:00,456,"I had a similar dissatisfied experience with their Blue Fox division.  I had been pissed off that I was continually bending the lure wire on their Blue Fox Vibrax spinners (#'s 4-6), often after only one fish or even from just casting.  So after a few years of this I finally decided to send them one back with a detailed letter explaining what was happening and requesting an informed  response from them.  It cost me around $7 to send it to them.  I explained that it was my goto spinner for Pike and Bass and that I had probably bent around ten over the last few years or so and that this seemed to be a new experience that I don't remember happening a few years ago.  My response from them was a replacement spinner with an in-house shippers receipt detailing the one lure exchanged.  No written acknowledgement, no explanation, not even a form letter.  I could have bought close to two of them for what it cost me to ship it to them.  That is going to be the last Blue Fox Vibrax spinner I own until they upgrade their lure wire.  Silver Lining:  I rediscovered my other Goto Pike/Bass spinner, Mepps Black Fury.  Over 20 fish on one lure and still straight.  Cheers, Mark"

361532,CLofchik,2009-07-13 15:43:00,854," No, they USED to make high quality mass produced lures.  Now they just produce the same Chinese injected plastic crap as everybody else.  Actually the longevity on new Rapala's I've used has been worse than almost every other lure I have.  Find an old Rapala box, if they're MADE in Finland or Ireland they're the good, hand assembled tank test lures that Rapala built their reputation on.  Find a new plastic Rapala, they're ASSEMBLED in Estonia.....but built by the boxcar somewhere in SE Asia.  That little bit of semantics is the differance between garbage & gold.  I've got half a dozen XRaps that have holes in them and are junk.  No bouncing off rocks, pike have just punched holes in the soft crappy plastic they use, with one it only took ONE 25"" pike to ruin a lure.  I got the same letter saying ""damaged in use"".  They're junk that is selling for a premium price on their reputation alone.  I'm more impressed with Bass Pro's XPS minnows, which have pretty much supplanted Rapala's as my everyday crank baits, hell even the hooks are half decent and don't need to be replaced.  Unlike Rapala's.   For bouncing off rocks try to find an old Storm metal lipped Hot'N'Tot, great little lure.  That is until Normark bought them, replaced the metal lip with plastic and turned it into junk that separates the same way as the OP's DT.  Storm received so many irate letters and broken lures they went back to the old moulds & metal lips.  So writing in may get Rapala to improve their crap in a few years."

361543,JohnF,2009-07-13 16:00:00,3494,From a business point of view they have to be careful about returning the defective item. If they kept it you would have been within your rights to complain that they had taken away your evidence of a problem.  They could have sent you a new replacement for about the same cost to them as returning yours but then they'd be setting a precedent for every return they ever get. You'd have been on here telling everyone what a great company they are and everyone who reads it would be packing up all their old scratched raps to send in for shiny new replacements.  JF
