Like for example lets say it says 4 bass as limit, is that for 1 person on the boat or if you have 4 people on the boat can you still only catch 4?  Second question is, i will be fishing south bay area heres a link:                 http://www.promisedlandcamp.net/fishingmap.html  And i was wondering if anyone has fished the area in the last little while  How deep are the walleye,bass,pike ect  Whats hot out there right now as far as lures go?  And lastly howsthe fishing, last year the bass fishing was slow in july, whats it like now?  Thanks in advance  ~ L.A"

Make sure to check the regs for Nipissing.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html    Nipissing is in Zone 11 now. And it has it's own exeptions.
