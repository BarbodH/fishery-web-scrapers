360697,dave524,2009-07-10 20:04:00,4508,"  Trying to remember when they started the resident fishing licences in Ontario, early 70's I'm guessing. Anyone ???"
360799,Dara,2009-07-11 01:38:00,3052,"Well, I guess we don't need to carry our outdoors cards this weekend guys. And those with conservation licences can take a full limit."

361898,tinbanger,2009-07-14 03:25:00,1028,youngest son and I went out sunday morning on Simcoe and it was surprisingly quiet . I think wind and cool temps kept most away. we fished big bay to cooks bay with a few average bass and perch to show for it. Mike did have a decent pike on for about 2 seconds LOL hit his shad coloured crank bait boatside .Only a couple of teeth marks to show for it . No pics as I thought I had left my camera and cell behind .  going out again Wednesday morning  TB
