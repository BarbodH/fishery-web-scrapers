361901,tinbanger,2009-07-14 03:30:00,1028,Looking for a change of scenery and was wondering if it was worth the drive ( 45 min from barrie?) Planning amid week trip to avoid the weekend rush Feel free to PM  TB
361906,Jonny,2009-07-14 03:50:00,1380, Heck it's only six miles --- go for it!  I shouldn't drink on a Monday night.
361908,tinbanger,2009-07-14 03:55:00,1028,And I should LOL TB
361932,bigugli,2009-07-14 10:35:00,6138,"It's a big lake. Lots of arms, bays etc...  Don't bother on a weekend. Noise and boat traffic is plain stupid, but Tuesday to Friday....  Fishing has improved greatly in 25 years. The farther from the park, the better the fishing gets. Great bass and pike action."
361940,tinbanger,2009-07-14 12:04:00,1028,thanks Bigugli I may give it a go . I have a very basic map of the lake and will plan to boat 15-30 minutes before we start picking good looking spots . Back up plan will be Lady Simcoe  TB
361950,Cudz,2009-07-14 12:39:00,2652,Go to six mile. It is a great lake.  Just fish all usual spots that look like they might hold fish and you will find that they do.
361966,NAW,2009-07-14 13:00:00,4022,"I've been fishing there for about 20 years.  Gotta cottage there.  There's a good mix of fish.  Rarly get skunked.  I hate using my depth finder on the lake, cuz I mark so many deep water fish, and can never seem to catch them!"
362093,bigugli,2009-07-14 18:04:00,6138," I grew up there, and the holes I fished 30 and 40 years back still produce."
362117,Paully,2009-07-14 18:38:00,712,"I've fished it a couple of times, Definately worth a try! smallmouth .. largies .. pike and possibly walleye in there."
362190,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-14 21:25:00,947,make sure you have a GPS cause the arms and shore line can honestly start to all look the same
