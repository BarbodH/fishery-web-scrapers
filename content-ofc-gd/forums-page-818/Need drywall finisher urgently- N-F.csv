361584,icefisherman,2009-07-13 17:10:00,952,I've had someone who did the drywall in my basement. The agreement was after I prime it he'll come finish some small defects that need correction. I've paid in full for that. He agreed to finish it all for the original amount agreed but has been since delaying it by constantly postponing it for all kinds of different reasons. He maybe hoping to extract some additional pay from me but that will not happen!  As my project cannot be held hostage and I must move it forward I am looking for someone else to come and put the finishing touches on the drywall so I can finish painting it/installing lights etc.  If someone in the area (Georgetown/Brampton/Milton) is willing to do it or knows someone to recommend please reply or PM me.  Thanks.
