361386,rbaquial,2009-07-13 03:40:00,968,I've been meaning to try out  THIS PARK  - I was also curious on how this area is? Thanks Man!! I'm gonna bring my ULTRALIGHT sometime!
361390,castgame,2009-07-13 03:47:00,161,let me know when you're going--we'll have an ultralight night!
361391,rbaquial,2009-07-13 03:53:00,968,Hahaha for sure dude!  I might be going tomorrow sometime during the day.
361392,castgame,2009-07-13 03:54:00,161,"i might be there tomorrow evening, probably til sundown..."
361393,rbaquial,2009-07-13 03:54:00,968,"  Dude, if you look @ the link I provided in the 1st post - what is that thing to the LEFT of the MARINA? Is that a dock or something?  HERE IT IS  again if you missed the 1st post."
361531,farsider,2009-07-13 15:43:00,456,"That is the yacht clubs material.  Some sort of floating crane.  I haven't seen it used in over a year.  Just a cormorant resting spot now.  With the associated smell.  Mostly carp to be found in that park, although I pulled around a 5lb sheepshead out of there last week.  No Browns to speak of in there, just shiners and other minnows surfacing.  Cheers, Mark"
361581,castgame,2009-07-13 17:09:00,161,"if those were shiners surfacing, they were big shiners"
361593,CLofchik,2009-07-13 17:33:00,854," It's alewife spawning time, they're like a big shad.  They come up to the surface in pairs and do quick circles, about 6"" or so long but tiny mouths.  "
361624,castgame,2009-07-13 18:29:00,161,huh! well now i know. guess there's no need to get the fly rod out now. unless the smallies are hitting on the surface...
