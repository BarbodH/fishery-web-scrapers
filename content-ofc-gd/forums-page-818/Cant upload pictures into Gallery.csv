361499,bucktail,2009-07-13 14:59:00,1857,"Been trying to update Team #4 tourney entries with a bass I caught on the weekend. Everytime I try to upload the picture to either one of my galleries I get this error message  Sorry, an error occurred. If you are unsure on how to use a feature, or don't know why you got this error message, try looking through the help files for more information.  The error returned was: The image upload failed, please contact a system administrator  Warning: Division by zero in /home/ofncommu/public_html/forums/modules/gallery/lib/gallery_library.php on line 1477   Maybe I am just doing something obviously wrong with it but is anyone else having problems?

I wish some guys on here did that so you wouldn't have to scroll left and right, up and down to experience the true beauty of a picture.  http://www.resize2mail.com/  Dirk"

361741,highdrifter,2009-07-13 22:40:00,2534,"That's a new one..  Not a resizing issue though.  I'm pretty sure you've got posting down pat.  On the other hand.  My Albums link won't work.  I have to go through my profile and click on a picture from there to get the option to upload.  Still waiting, Roy!!!"
