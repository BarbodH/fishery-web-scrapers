Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated  have a great week!  FNS"

You can literally feel all the headshakes the fish does!!  The idea is....  10'ft - 15'ft Float Rod Float Reel (If you're serious about it) and... Split Shotting Technique/Rig  If you send me an email to [emailÂ protected] - I can send you a .PDF file (that was recently shared on the forums here) that'll explain to you the different styles and techniques of Split Shotting.

361536,Twocoda,2009-07-13 15:50:00,4130,I have several different methods :  when the salmon are first comming in i use a 10.6 Fenwick/ABU spinning reel/ 8 # test as the season moves on i switch to 15' Float rod/Shefield float reel/ straight 6 # test on 8 # backer ( can run lighter leaders as the water requires) When the bows start comming in i switch to 13' StCroix/ steamside float reel/ 6 # test ( early) As the bows begin to pile up...9'Fenwick 7w fly rod /Martin fly reel As the water starts freeze i go back to the StCroix setup ...  This is the second Salmon run post in a couple of weeks....now im going to be wishing the summer away  As for detailed set ups ....the water dictates what you must do ....long/short leaders...# test leaders/...colour/size of bags/flies etc....  Welcome to the board and Good Luck

Leave the river boots to guys who can't hack big fish when they're prime..........y'know, pinheads  After your first 100 yard run drifting a 10' wide pool just doesn't do it."

361631,highdrifter,2009-07-13 19:04:00,2534," You're all jokes Pete.  Was that you I saw at the Credit last fall chucking and ducking with a surf rod??!!  If ya wanna be sporty and swing a fly rod through the runs, might I suggest the same sorta scenario, but with a booby fly instead of a circle hook and ear plug...  Boobies were originaly created in the UK for loch style brown trout fishing, but work well with fresh aggressive salmon just in..  They look like a wolley bugger, but with a distinct feature:  foam eyes attached at the head.  Add a couple shot to your leader about a 24in above the fly (add shot according to speed and depth), and it will swim just within strike range.  A good technique to working this fly, or any other for that matter, is to cast downstream at a 45 degree angle, and at the end of your swing, strip the fly back slowly towards you with your rod tip down just above the water.  That's called a downstream swing if I remember correctly.  Walk a couple steps downstream and repeat the process if you're working bigger water.  I've fooled many a chiny this way, and it's a bit more sporting and less sketchy...  cheers HD"

361796,drwxr,2009-07-14 00:09:00,453," seen that before, except people i saw were more passionate about fishing and were throwing stones in water to make the fish move in the pool and get tangled on their rigs on the downrigger rods."
