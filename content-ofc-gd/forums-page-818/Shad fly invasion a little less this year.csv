360538,Jonny,2009-07-10 13:46:00,1380,"The annual shad fly (may fly) invasion on Nipissing isn't as intense this year.  http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1649488  Maybe the fishing won't slow down as much as it usually seems to do when they're in full hatch.  But shad flies are apparently a good indicator of the health of the lake. So I don't mind putting up with them. My 3 year old grand-daughter loves 'em. She picks them off the wall of our house and lines them up on her forearm and walks around with them. She's fascinated by all bugs, so much so that I have a file of macro pictures for her on my laptop. She'll sit with me and rhyme off dozens of names - ""Dragonfly, damsel fly, mayfly, sawyer, weevil, sowbug, spitbug, firefly, fiery hunter..."" etc. etc.  A fiery hunter is a big beetle that might make good bait --- if it doesn't bite you first!

360587,jeffw,2009-07-10 15:04:00,267,I also noticed a minimal mayfly hatch on sturgeon lake in the kawartha's and talking with my buddy he also noticed this on other lakes. We figure it has something to do with the cold weather and water temps. Cheers Jeff
