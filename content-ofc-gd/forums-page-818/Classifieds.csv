Don't treat the ""ad"" as if you're paying per word in the local newspaper. A little extra description is free.  2. Include pictures if possible.  3. Mention the shipping costs - few of the people who read your ad will be locals. (Or mention that you will not ship and are only interested in selling to someone who can pick up the item.)  4. Make a fair asking price.  It's easy for anyone reading the ad to check with an internet search and see what the going price is for your item (or similar).  5. As soon as your item is sold, immediately edit your original post to say so.  ---  Ebay is a good guide for putting elements of an ad together.  A good ad with a reasonable price saves people from wasting their time (and yours)."
