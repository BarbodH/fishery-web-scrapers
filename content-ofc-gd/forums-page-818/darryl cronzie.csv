361745,fisherman7,2009-07-13 22:49:00,325,"Overall, I'm just jealous he has a fishing show and goes to great lodges and fly-ins and I don't!"
361747,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-13 22:54:00,10439,"While almost all shows are blatent advertising including The Chronz Meister that is what they are there for, to promote and sell fishing related items and services. The hope is that there is some good fishing thrown into the 20 minutes of airtime to make it worth while watching. There are a couple of shows that aren't 20 minute long infomercials that are broken up with 10 minutes of more commercials but not many."
361756,ozaibak1,2009-07-13 23:14:00,401,"I don't mind the show at all, I like the guy, someone who seems very generous and kind, like the fishermen I encounter while fishing. What's wrong with that? I don't see how you can dislike the show so much as to put a post up on it... I also wanted to say to an early comment that I don't think many novices are going to be catching many Muskie in the first place, it's not like he's a major influence on how many muskies are going to end up as table fare, he's being honest at least."
361758,fishingisliving,2009-07-13 23:17:00,170,I cant wait to go fishing!!!!!!!!!!
361770,holdfast,2009-07-13 23:30:00,1813,"Un-Like the Lemmings, i also agree.  I like How and where he fishes, his Guests, His tricks, his Rants.  As far as eating Fish, love his shore lunches, wish i was there.  He doesn't wear billboards, talks about Flouracarbon and Okuma all day, AND, has these weird baits called Bubblegum and Yummy or whatever.  Good show"
361774,basserone,2009-07-13 23:34:00,7,"Like it has been mentioned before, it is not only Cronzie all the fishing shows are the same, indorsing their sponsors and provide little to no information to the viewing angler.  I watched Mercer the other day on the Score, I had a hard time actually watching him, but he was bragging about the Mercer Magic crank bait.  I do not have time for people who make a living from misinforming anglers into buying their products that might, and I mean might, have worked on that given day.  The technology  thay have today can allow them to chop, cut and edit the filming and the viewer has know way of knowing. Mercer might have caught one fish all day for all we know.  I was a tournament angler for many years and saw a well know angler, using Diawa equipment on the water, but was indorsing Shimano rods and reels while on stage.  What a joke, whatever happened to the In-fisherman, even at the end that became very commercialised, but at least they talked fish scense, without stating that you required a specific rod or reel to catch fish.  The other day I watched a little girl fishing from a dock using a stick, string, and hook with a piece of red wool on the hook and she was catching panfish one after another.  No special equipment there.  If you must watch these shows, watch them for entertainment only and beleive half of what you see, and half of what they say.  This is big business, these guys are not professional anglers, they are salespeople making a living off each and everone who supports them."
361779,Twocoda,2009-07-13 23:41:00,4130,just like the oxy-clean dude eh???? RIP Billy Mays......pitchman extrodinaire ...
361781,solopaddler,2009-07-13 23:44:00,8605, He was replaced by Vince the Sham Wow guy. I had absolutely no idea how badly I needed thick absorbent towlets 'till I watched that infomercial.
361786,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 23:48:00,73,yea its true with the mercers magic thing.. that pissed me off to no end....i hope dave does not become like the others.i agree about the in-fisherman.. what happened to that... very good show. and another rant. the guy from fish tv ron james NEEDs to move the mike ferther from his mouth. his heavy breathing irritates me.
361788,ricoboxing,2009-07-13 23:49:00,398,"i like his shore lunches, but seriously i'd rather be out fishing, or doing more important stuff on weekend mornings; rather than watching fishing shows."
361794,beertech,2009-07-14 00:04:00,118,Chronzy is right about the mnr. Its run by polititions and snot nosed kids who have no real understanding of the fishery.  The salmon stocking is a mess on lake ontario for one. There are some good conservations officers out there but they are too underfunded to do their jobs properly.  I don;t mind him having a shore lunch.   Don;t get why the scotty tournament  doesn;t get more backlash. There is no way the boats are eating 25 fish plus they each kill in a weekend.
361797,Greencoachdog,2009-07-14 00:09:00,8163, Ditto!
361799,Greencoachdog,2009-07-14 00:14:00,8163,  ... but what if he was a sponsor and advertised on this board???
361800,ColdH20guy,2009-07-14 00:14:00,312, free preview on now of WFN on cable anyway; used to subscribe to it but cancelled due to reruns and infomercials all the time...
361801,love2fishhave2work,2009-07-14 00:14:00,212,"Not a fan of any fishing show that requires spending tens of thousands of dollars to experience the same thing the host experiences.  No way I have the time to go to any of those lodges.  That said to each his own.  Maybe that is part of his appeal.  I am not sure I find the ""He speaks his mind"" arguement valid.  So does my senile grandfather and the little dictator in N. Korea.  Speaking one's mind is not a very good measurement of an individual."
361804,bigugli,2009-07-14 00:15:00,6138,"Yeah, he's a loudmouth.  Big Deal.   So he likes to eat fish. I believe every angler should include a frying pan as an integral part of their fishing gear."
361806,BillM,2009-07-14 00:17:00,17367,  BUDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
361808,Roy,2009-07-14 00:20:00,13728,Everyone get everything off their chests? Good. Now how about something constructive?
361809,Greencoachdog,2009-07-14 00:20:00,8163,  I can see that!!!
361673,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 20:35:00,73,"i have been watching wfn for a few years now and im getting sick of cronzie... he belittles nonstop  the mnr and he does not support catch and release, i even remember one episode were he said ''theres nothing like a good muskie fillet'' give me a break! yea lets ecourage the novice angler to eat muskie... he would be so hard to fish with.. he gets soojelous when the guide gets fish..(i get a good laugh outta that!).. he is so sponor orientated that he wouldent dare name something that ise'nt his sponor. darryl its time to throw in the towel buddy.. retire and give the timeslot to dave mercer or the fishn canada guys. i know your replies are going to be: then dont watch it.. i think we can all relate to this though.. dave is way more deserving that darryl. heck mike miller can make his own show instead of this guy."
361674,TJQ,2009-07-13 20:36:00,7806,"Personally, Im a bit tired of the fishing show / cronzie bashing"
361676,musky66,2009-07-13 20:38:00,273,"Personally I don't care for any of the fishing shows on TV right now. Blatant advertising for lodges and tackle, not enough info or tips, etc. Pretty lame stuff."
361677,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-13 20:40:00,0,making fun of chronz is too easy. i'm just glad that i'm not the only one who thinks the guy is COMPLETELY out of touch.
361680,Roy,2009-07-13 20:42:00,13728,This rant comes up quarterly. You can watch Dave Mercer on the Score or WFN as well as watch some great videos on his site.
361683,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 20:43:00,73,he has nooooooo orientation in the fish.... walleye all the time!  he hates on us ontarians for calling it pickeral! i dont know why he hates us on it! anyone can go on a guided trip in the middle of the bush and catch pickeral with a live minnow... it takes real skill to catch them with a crainkbait or grub on a pressured lake like what most other shows due
361685,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 20:46:00,73,yea i talk to dave once in a while. good guy. add him on facebook or like roy said go on his site.. in my mind he is the future of tv shows.. he has a big veriaty of fish and a good sence of humor.
361688,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-13 20:50:00,3761," I also remember that he said this after saying that if a musky were badly hooked and bleeding the musky would most likely die anyway, further more why waste a musky.  Whats better, one in your belly feeding you, or floating in the lake...feeding the gulls. It's important to make judgement calls to keep fish, some people(myself included) keep fish to have a fish fry/shore lunch thing. Others keep fish in order not to let them die.  What he said there was not wrong in any way shape or form."
361689,LeXXington,2009-07-13 20:52:00,1928,"Ahhh Fishing show bashing..  Right, host should not promote the sponsors,, go too lodges for fishing.. next you want them too start working for free cause they love the sport.  How about you also stop watching all the movies and televison shows that have product placements,,  After thats done stop listening to the radio for advertizement.  Your next cable bill or Sat bill will be how much??  Darryl is not always correct but he tell's it like it is. He has done more for this province than most  love him or hate him its a fishing show made in Canada, with an Ontario host.  Dave, Bob,  Darry and the rest  should be promoted not bashed.  And yes I agree they should show more how too's"
361692,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-13 20:58:00,3761,"Also, I wonder if you would be bashing him and his show if he were a member of OFC, like Dave."
361695,danbo,2009-07-13 21:01:00,2646,Hey Patty..besides your terrible grammar.  Have YOU contributed anything to the fisheries or their care?
361697,rickster,2009-07-13 21:06:00,495,Although I haven't seen every episode with Chronzy I can say I don't recall disagreeing with anything he has said on any the episodes I watched. You say you are getting sick of him. If you don't like the show why do you continue to watch it?  Lot worse shows out there
361698,Roy,2009-07-13 21:08:00,13728, His son is a member and I'm sure it doesn't make him feel too good.
361699,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 21:08:00,73,"actually yes ,i have bad grammar because i am very french and i dont care about typos. i am a member of ducks unlimited. ofah. muskeys canada. i helped raise walleye for local stocking( iwas responsible for 14000) and i could not give a flying hoot if he was a member of OFC.. infact i want him to see this. i gave 6000$ of my tournament winnings to invasive species research and for the re-introducking of atlantic salmon( wiich i regret)"
361701,Terry,2009-07-13 21:16:00,14456,"I don't always agree with him, but he says what he believes  and most of what he says about the MNR has merit  I am sure he follows the regs to the letter, so if he wants to eat fish, who am I to put him down  now if he dresses in black and try's to act like a 15 year old talking smack and slapping the fish back into the water I will complain oh wait fishn canada already tried that and we know how well that went over"
361707,highdrifter,2009-07-13 21:26:00,2534," Actually, I thought you did pretty good.   Anybody who brings that up has poor use of their only language and couldn't sniff the sweat around your bollocks.  I'm with you man.  You couldn't pay me to whatch his show.  I'd reck my tv with repeated remote beatings.  Different strokes for different folks..  cheers HD"
361709,misfish,2009-07-13 21:31:00,29133,"I too did some Cron bashing way back.But after talking to his son,who does read this board,so Im sure you will get your wish to him.Cron is Cron.He speaks his mind. Just like we do here.  Lets aggree to disaggree."
361719,BillM,2009-07-13 21:53:00,17367,"Like people have said, atleast he speaks his mind.  He is the biggest supporter for more CO's on the water, so I can't see this blanket hate he has for the MNR.  Is he pissed with what they've done with the money that comes from our licenses and fee's?  Hell yeah, and I'm sure if you knew what it went to, you'd be pissed to.  I do think he needs to ease up on eating everything he catches and maybe practice a bit more catch and release, but there are far worse shows on OFC then the Cronz."
361722,pike slayer,2009-07-13 22:01:00,1177,"i wish i could get the fishing channel and your complaining, be happy you can watch something like this sure it needs to be ironed out but enjoy it"
361724,solopaddler,2009-07-13 22:05:00,8605,"The Don Cherry of the fishing world, I like him."
361732,misfish,2009-07-13 22:17:00,29133, EXACTLY. Nice call Solo
361735,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-13 22:21:00,0,I eat fish.............  I'd eat more if I could just catch em.
361737,cuillerierk,2009-07-13 22:35:00,32,I personally like the show. Better than anything else on T.V Saturday morning (unfortunately I don't have WFN)    Plus I love his Breading and Batter mix.
361742,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 22:44:00,73,yea support to have more cos on the water and the field 100% yea he speaks his mind but sometimes we just dont want to hear it.... the time he spends complain he could be giving tips... you dont need much skill to catch walleye up north with live bait.... anyone could do that.
361744,lovemyprovince,2009-07-13 22:47:00,73,"and another thing.. i eat fish too. but a ''pro angler'' like him should be promoting c&r regardless. his whole darn show is promoting lodges( witch is good for the economy but common!) and his sponsors. he has not givin tips i think... ever. also his batter is crap, it does not stick like fish crisp."
