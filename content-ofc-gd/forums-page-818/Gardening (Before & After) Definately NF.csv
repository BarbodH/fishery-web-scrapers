362121,fishnsled,2009-07-14 18:40:00,3520,Very nice work Joey any Paul.  Now when is the BBQ so we can all see it in person?
361308,Joey,2009-07-12 23:59:00,9122,"I had a vision in mind for the crappy garden that was here when we bought this place.  A few trips to Lowe's and in two days, we are finally finished.  Backbreaking work, but well worth it.  Paul was a trooper and plowed through with me. Thanks Hon, I know that's not what you had in mind for the weekend, but we can fish two days next weekend     Just finished about an hour ago.  Here's the pics.                  Cheers,  Joey"
361310,Roy,2009-07-13 00:05:00,13728,"Very nice.....you guys did a great job. Good place to pick worms too....when you have leftovers, throw them in there!"
361311,Roy,2009-07-13 00:06:00,13728,What did you call the frog that's sitting in there?
361313,Joey,2009-07-13 00:07:00,9122, That's Rrrriiibbbiiittt Rrrrooooyyyy
361314,Roy,2009-07-13 00:09:00,13728,oooooooooooooooooo  That gave me shivers I'm so honoured!
361318,Terry,2009-07-13 00:16:00,14456,nice job  did you know from the start that you needed to turn every second stone   or did you just figure it out
361320,bigugli,2009-07-13 00:22:00,6138,"Looks good gang.   You also left your plants enough room to spread and fill out naturally. There is a nice variation in texture, colour and height.  Question: How much light will your garden receive, and when in the day wil it receive it? I see shade plants combined with sun lovers."
361323,motv8tr,2009-07-13 00:23:00,2587,"Looks awesome Joey!!!  You guys did a great job, and ya, it was worth it!!!!  Maureen"
361330,Greencoachdog,2009-07-13 00:48:00,8163,  That's what I always wanted to do!!!... throw garbage in my flower garden!!!  ... I think not!!!
361332,medmart,2009-07-13 00:53:00,587,Joey you and Paul did a great job looks really nice  Rob
361333,Joey,2009-07-13 01:03:00,9122,"  I figured it out after Terry, thanks for pointing that out"
361334,Terry,2009-07-13 01:04:00,14456,LOL...sorry
361335,Joey,2009-07-13 01:05:00,9122," It gets about 5 - 6 hours of sun, mixed with shade because of the tall trees on the other side of the yard.  I'll learn as I go I suppose.  Joey"
361350,pigeonfisher,2009-07-13 01:48:00,696,Looks GREAT.  Really transforms the back yard.  I like simple gardens.
361378,bigugli,2009-07-13 03:26:00,6138," If it is morning sun, the hostas will be fine.  The grasses will be fine with 6 hours of light."
361404,scuro2,2009-07-13 05:17:00,904, That one put a smile on my face.
361444,Greencoachdog,2009-07-13 12:43:00,8163,That really is a beautiful little garden!!!... and a job well done!!!

361613,douG,2009-07-13 18:08:00,2693,"You have a good eye, JoAnne, two more than likely.  That really spruces up the place."

361715,misfish,2009-07-13 21:49:00,29133,Great job J. Dont forget the garlic cloves to keep the critters out.
361886,Joey,2009-07-14 02:52:00,9122,"I just put mothballs and lemon zest around the edges tonight, I hope that works.  If not, garlic is my next step B.  Saw fresh paw print in it this morning  Joey"
361945,IndySKS,2009-07-14 12:29:00,134,"Your wife made you put those plants in your new worm garden didn't she? ....lol  Does she know they will get messed up while you did for worms....?   LOl  Good Job on the bed, lots of hard back breaking labor."
361954,Mike Pike,2009-07-14 12:43:00,1332,A couple of lawn chairs and some bevies and that there is a nice place to relax!  Nice job Joey and Paul creating your own little backyard paradise!  Enjoy it this summer!
