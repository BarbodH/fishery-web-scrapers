A buddy and me are going out for the first time ever  tomorrow so we are just wondering where to start. We are using dipsey's and spin doctors so we just need to know how deep to run them."
361909,silveradosheriff,2009-07-14 04:00:00,1025,"Wll Fishnpro, kinda depends what water you are fishing.....  In general, I would start in 60 fow and start working my way out looking for bait balls. Stagger the depths and let the hunting begin.  Tightlines!"
