I am dying to try the double cowgirl. but the le barons in ottawa doesnt sell em.  i seem to catch em best on small crankbaits and topwater - big o's, torpedos, skitter prop, ripplin redfin  what am i doing wrong? i had a HUGE lunge on a redfin. all my fish are rarely over 6lbs, i usually fish smaller bodies of water maybe thats why the fish are smaller. i dunno  How do you catch the big ones? ppl go by moon phases?  i also heard i cant use 10"" suckers anymore. that sucks cuz my cat stopped producing kittens a few years ago.  thanks"

Now I also like jakes,doubleD's and Triple D's if you want double 13 and double 10 bucktails try giving this site a look they work great and will save you money I only have one of each size but will be getting some more as they both look great in the water and pull very nice.http://www.tackleindustries.com/  This here is a Woodie color is called the Ottawa sucker and sure looks great in the tea color water "

361769,fishingisliving,2009-07-13 23:27:00,170," then wait till you get a 40 lber..   all lures are good man.  Once you find where they live in the water, on days where they are agressive you can throw a Coke can with a hook and they will smash it. Sometimes you will throw the most expensive lure that you saw on musky hunter and not see a fish the whole season on it..."
