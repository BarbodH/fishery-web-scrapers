We spent most of our time in 38+ FOW on sunday without a touch, but marked some fish. I hear that 15 fow with boards is the way to go right now for brownies etc.  What would be better? Off bronte or off Jordan or somewhere else? I live in Hamilton, so those 2 are my options for tomorrow  Thanks  Any recommendations on lures would help too!"
569609,fisher,2011-04-06 17:43:00,451,Check out spoonpullers.com for more info but I understand Jordan would be better than Bronte this time of the year.
569610,moosehead,2011-04-06 17:45:00,90,the south shore would be a better bet off of Jordan or Dalhousie
569611,Pikeslayer,2011-04-06 17:47:00,1443,definitely Jordan now for kings & cohos. Bluffs late May & June and things will start heating up in Bronte/PC later in June through to mid September.  Slayer
569617,Ricky Bobby,2011-04-06 17:56:00,35,Im going to run some size 0 dipseys w spoons and boards I guess.
569626,bigmac1984,2011-04-06 18:33:00,193,Any shore opportunities anywhere for the trout at this time of year?
569640,irishfield,2011-04-06 20:00:00,26272,Did ya get that kicker running???
569641,dave524,2011-04-06 20:01:00,4508," I'd go with Rapalas J9 or 11's or other stick type baits, either long lined or off boards, stay inside of 20 feet of water. It will be a few weeks before the Kings start, they just don't seem to be there this early , even on the south shore, not sure where they are, maybe deep still."
569647,Ricky Bobby,2011-04-06 20:15:00,35,"Havent been out since, so I will try what you said tomorrow Irish. I went into Bay City here in Hamilton. Apparently, I have a secret button to push in and move the throttle forward and then turn key.  We shall see!!"
569664,irishfield,2011-04-06 20:46:00,26272,There's no secret... that's exactly what I told you to do.. push in the shift isolator button and move the throttle forward to 1/3rd for the first try... push the electric choke in and out a few times while cranking.
569778,Pigeontroller,2011-04-06 23:34:00,2793,"Its a bit early, water was still below 40 degrees last Saturday, but that didn't stop this Chinny from playing...    20 fow, Firetiger J-13, In-line board 50 feet out, 100 feet back..."
569816,bucktail,2011-04-07 01:38:00,1857,"Go as south as you can and look for green water, get the boards out and dont take your eye off the temperature guage."
570092,Ricky Bobby,2011-04-08 01:07:00,35,"WOOOO  HOOOOO!!!!!  Well, all the stars musta lined up today.  I got the kicker running like a kitten today Irish - thanks  We got on the water maybe 8:30 or 9am.  Water was warmer than last weekend - we found 40.8 - 42 degrees, green water.  10 - 18 FOW  chart/silver J11  Firetiger J11  Black a silver some jointed minnow  Black and gold J11  Chart J13  All totalled 7 for 8.  6 brown, 1 rainbow  NICE!!!"
570386,Ricky Bobby,2011-04-09 00:10:00,35,Now I am getting addicted. When salmon come in Im in troube
