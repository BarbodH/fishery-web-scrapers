BRP's technology development centre at the University of Sherbrooke has been awarded a multi-million dollar contract to develop the chassis and propulsion system for the rover vehicles. Incredibly cool to think that some development of E-TEC technology could wind up on another planet! I guess guys who think Evinrude's are ""out of this world"" might really be onto something.  More."
570011,Fisherman,2011-04-07 21:06:00,7201,Somehow I can't picture anyone wanting to pollute Mars or Uranus with an Etec.
570031,HTHM,2011-04-07 22:34:00,4082,"The way i hear it, Uranus is polluted pretty bad as it is...."
570179,ah_long,2011-04-08 05:12:00,354, I'm sure Etec would help you push the harmful emissions out of Uranus
