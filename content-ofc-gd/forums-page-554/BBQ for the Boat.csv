568879,John Bacon,2011-04-04 03:01:00,3277," Do you have a quick release braket for a bow mount motor?  If so, you could attach it there as long as you don't to bring both the barbeque and the bow mount."

569524,superdad,2011-04-06 12:59:00,353,"If you have time to BBQ on the boat, the your fishing time is suffering. We hardly have time to eat a sandwich, we keep ourselves quite busy.  Just my .02  David  aka  Superdad"

569536,Pikeslayer,2011-04-06 13:55:00,1443," Thx David. I wish we were constantly boating fish and not have time to eat, that would be the utlitmate day. As I mentioned, I am considering this for LO trolling trips only. 4-5 hours on the water and a 12/13 mile trip out to the Bluezone makes for a hungry crew. I do a number of 'charity charters' every summer (July/Aug) and would like to include a hot bbq meal for the guests. When we are on the water in Seguin, I agree. There is too much going on and too little time"
569547,ricoboxing,2011-04-06 14:24:00,398,real bbq comes from charcoal not a propane cylinder!  :thumbsup_anim:

570187,pikehunter,2011-04-08 10:09:00,1659,"Here's the answer to your question and it's homemade, sort of. But you might have to add a little more floatation foam to your boat.... "
570191,Billy Bob,2011-04-08 10:57:00,5865," I LOVE the name ""Grillzilla""....  Now if you miscalculate on additional flotation foam you could just change the name to ""Subzilla""..."
570217,fisher,2011-04-08 13:28:00,451,"I keep spending money when I read these types of psost .  I just bought the Napoleon Portable that was recommended and sold on Costco.ca.  It has more BTUs than the Weber, and the reviews on the Costco website actually has someone who has compared the two and prefers the one from Costco.  And it is $10 cheaper than compared to the Weber sold at Home Depot."
568281,Pikeslayer,2011-04-01 20:32:00,1443,"Good Day, I'm thinking of purchasing a portable BBQ for the boat; http://www.napoleong..._gas_grill.html  Primarily, I would like to have this available for the 4/5 hour days/evenings on Lake Ontario. Just wondering if any of you have done the same and if there are any issues I should be concerned about. I'm thinking about pole mounting it in the bow (where the seat mount is).  "
568282,jedimaster,2011-04-01 20:39:00,3472,I am not sure anyone here would say its safe. However I have a 16' lund and I bring a portable barbeque on mine and just set it up on the front casting deck and bbq all the time. Not even sure if thats legal or not.... maybe I should look into the legality of it.

568294,craigdritchie,2011-04-01 21:09:00,1586,"There are all kinds of portable barbecues available for use on a boat. Some of them clamp on railings, others mount into rod holders or plug into the pedestal seat base plate (as you mentioned you want to do). Go rummage around a couple of boating stores and you'll find all kinds of BBQs. Splurge for a stainless steel model to avoid corrosion issues.  Nothing beats having hot food on the water. Just be ready when other guys fishing nearby stare at you like you just shot their dog."
568305,Muskieman,2011-04-01 22:12:00,2472,"Freedom Grill FG50!!  I've had this thing for 4 years now and no problems whatsoever!! Really , it's guaranteed 3 years or 30.000 Miles... It comes with me everywhere I go. I saved 150$ by BBQ'n in the parking lot at Canada's Wonderland VS buying their food:clapping: I brought it to cook lunch at the little Callander Bay G2G  It's made to stay on your hitch or removes for table top use.. It sits on a swivel that takes a 2.5"" tube .. very easy to install on a pedestal seat post.. tough as nails an cooks a great steak.. You'd have a ton of room on your boat for it.  http://www.freedomgrill.com       I love it!  Randy "
568311,Leecher,2011-04-01 22:26:00,7832,Sounds like a cool idea Simon   fresh fish on the grill Can't help you on that but intrigued to know what will work best for your boat
568312,Billy Bob,2011-04-01 22:26:00,5865,"Don't quote me on this....but I think in the USA it's illegal unless you have the proper equipment.....I know on 2 houseboat trips in the Kawathans we had a full size gas grill aboard.......but if you do decide to BBQ onboard PLEASE be EXTRA cautious because you could turn your boat into a bomb. Do some extra research on this before just doing it...maybe contact your Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary for info.  Good Luck and play it SAFE, Bob"

568413,nofish4me,2011-04-02 02:28:00,404,"Be careful if you refill 1 lb propane cylinders, using an adapter. Hahaha BBQ and boat, just be careful and mindful of what could catch fire. I cooked beef ribs on a portable BBQ, that was on someones tailgate. Standing in a motel room at the Hungry Bear, enjoying a beverage, looking forward to the beef ribs (lots of fat) I happened to notice everything was on fire, BBQ, tailgate, parking lot, etc. Lots of fat on them things. Got all flames extinguished and no damage to anything, just the grease that was on fire."
568415,nofish4me,2011-04-02 02:30:00,404," Ok, but have you actually ever used that thing? hahaha Nice setup."
568416,irishfield,2011-04-02 02:34:00,26272,"That was the install picture in 2007. I did it so we could have shore lunch, or grill some burgers, without going to shore in the back bays of Temagami... or when camping in the boat. Stove is completely over the side and works very well. I get liquid flames when I overfill the 1 lber though..."

I love my Weber Q100  bought a portable bbq at costco a month back (nexgrill portable stainless) it could barely grill a steak  went out and bought the weber and it's great, no complaints i use it as my ""main"" bbq in the appartment cause we are not allowed to have bbqs"

568480,Billy Bob,2011-04-02 15:27:00,5865," Errrrr.....ah, not good......and could be illegal (found out almost everything in Canada is illegal...  )inside a apartment, unless of course you use it under a range hood but my guess would be no. But to each his own."

568539,Pikeslayer,2011-04-02 22:00:00,1443," I think the bow/casting deck is the way to go (regardless of the drool factor). There's too much goin' on at the stern and you gotta go with safety first (there'll be an additional A/B/C on board). Im going to wait until the Mistress is home from storage and have my fabricating buddy come up with a portable/solid mounting solution. BTW, I'm liking the weber Q series (construction and portability) and I won't be doing any DYI propane refills.  mmmmmmmmmm......... Mar-a-Lago Turkey Burgers on the boat"
568594,2advanced,2011-04-03 01:41:00,53,I thought you had to have a washroom and a bed to cook on a boat?  Or us that only for drinking
568598,dhickey,2011-04-03 01:56:00,1038,this bbq is awesum. used it 3yrs now at least 2-3 times a week. mounting it might be tricky its verry portable and easy to cook on.
