I could just angle it but I wanna try and get it in... Not much room... So here goes...   OH SO CLOSE!!!   Unbolted the chains, took off the lights, wiring harness and test allignment..   Time to cut...   Ahhh... gotta love the Rescue Bladea and recipriccating saw.. Goes through like butter... Almost cut the harness.   Test fit before I bolt it down..   Move the wheel thingy back, Drilled some holes, Bolted it all back up...     All done...  Very happy. Saved me from buying the hinge do hickey. If it was like a foot off I wolda got the hinge, but only a few inches.. just not worth it."
570611,Terry,2011-04-10 00:25:00,14456,nice job
570613,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-10 00:29:00,1107,Nice job. I would be really carefull first time pulling it might change the way it pulls or turns just thinkin out loud would hate to see ya ding the boat or tow vehicle .
570615,jedimaster,2011-04-10 00:41:00,3472,"Yah, with only a 6 inches off tongue. I am not too worried about it. And being I tow it with a Jeep, I gotta be real careful anyway. Next job is to paint the trailer the same color as the jeep. I painted the TJ last weekend...  Here is a pic of the TJ, after the OG paint scheme. Only half done in the pic but you get the idea. Trailer is gonna go the same color.  "
570616,Terry,2011-04-10 00:45:00,14456,"well the tongue weight will be more and if that's not a problem you will be fine  you could move the axle ahead a bit if it is a problem, but I don't think it will"
570619,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-10 00:51:00,2050,"That's awesome! Haha love the jeep to!  I had an '89 yj all tricked out back in highschool!  You know before I had 3 kids! Hehe as soon as my little monsters grow up I'm going to get another one! Good work!   Cheers, Ryan"
570620,Terry,2011-04-10 00:54:00,14456,"He has to have a Jeep he lives in Keswick, next it's lumber jack shirts.....  did I say I was born and raised in Keswick    not a word......"
570623,NAW,2011-04-10 00:59:00,4022,God Bless Sawsalls!  I don't know what I would do with out mine.
570627,mercman,2011-04-10 01:05:00,7054,Good job ! Goes really well when you have all the right tools eh? git'er done.

570653,jedimaster,2011-04-10 01:48:00,3472,I was wearing a lumberjacket... I used to live in port perry so I already had 3.
570654,jedimaster,2011-04-10 01:49:00,3472,Haha that's nice.
570657,glen,2011-04-10 02:01:00,2641,Thats some nice work right there.  Now what paint are you going to use on your trailer?
570660,jedimaster,2011-04-10 02:07:00,3472,"Gonna strip the trailer down clean up the little rusty bits, prime it and use the same paint from the car, I think I'll seal it though."
570661,glen,2011-04-10 02:10:00,2641,You are going all out.  Get at it open water is coming.
570665,jedimaster,2011-04-10 02:24:00,3472,"Tremclad is good too, as long as you thin it out and put a few coats on. Car paint is a bit more durable and can also be rolled. For the jeep and the trailer though, its flat Olive Green. The boat will be done in Gloss black tremclad, the inside will be flat rolled on. Just killing time sprucing things up while I am waiting for the ice to melt."
570666,skeeter,2011-04-10 02:38:00,1907,The inside of the boat is going to be black? Thats going to get real hot in the summer.
570705,jedimaster,2011-04-10 12:50:00,3472,"Outside black, inside khaki"
