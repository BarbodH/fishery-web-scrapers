The new standards, which will affect passenger capacity ratings for all boats, take effect December 1.  Expect the Canadian Coast Guard to follow suit.  Click for more info."
569929,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-07 15:50:00,10439,I hear the boat manufacturers are also now implimenting larger big gulp sized drink holders and french fry dispensers on the 2012 models.
569930,craigdritchie,2011-04-07 15:51:00,1586,"Don't know about the fry dispenser (great idea though!!) but ... ahem .... yup, Big Gulp-sized cup holders are indeed becoming standard on just about everything."
569931,mercman,2011-04-07 15:54:00,7054,"Excellent info. I have often wondered how they got 589LB 4 person capacity for my Boat. If I took 3 of my friends fishing with me, I would most definately be over the limit."
569998,jedimaster,2011-04-07 20:14:00,3472,"  Avereage height of 5'8"" BMI of 150pds, times 4 people is 600 pds....now the typical american at 5'8"" is likely 225 pds.  Add a few Ultra Super Biggie Wendy's burgers and now your boat only holds 2 people.  Why not just have a weight rating, rather than a person rating. 2 adults and 3 kids in a 14 footer may be fine but 3 big fat dudes may sink it."
570000,Billy Bob,2011-04-07 20:20:00,5865, My sister in-law would put me over the limit...
