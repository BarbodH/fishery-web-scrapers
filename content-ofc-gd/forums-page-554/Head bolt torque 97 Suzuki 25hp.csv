From what I've seen... 20 foot pounds...  If you know or know where I should look for the info please let me know
570398,aplumma,2011-04-09 00:48:00,6896,Send a P.M. to Bernie he might see it before he reads the posts. He seems to have a lot of info  on outboards at his finger tips.    Art
570399,vinnimon,2011-04-09 00:52:00,2593,"  not sure of the specs , but I do know on vehicle heads for torque. A torque angle gauge is required. Pretty cheap at princess auto."
570425,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-09 02:20:00,10439, Only if the head bolts are the torque to yeild type mostly seen on newer engines.  As for the OP's question check on the iboats forum.
570431,vinnimon,2011-04-09 02:27:00,2593,"  Agreed, great bunch of folks there. Dave if it is a yield type bolt, price wise princess auto has them and hasnt failed me yet."
570626,steelhedrmatt,2011-04-10 01:02:00,278,I don't know if this site will help.  It was correct for the head bolts on my sled.  http://www.nutty.com/techdata.shtml  Hope it helps.
