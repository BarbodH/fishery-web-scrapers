569921,super dave,2011-04-07 15:22:00,323,One of my fav baits and they discontinued it.  Does anyone know of any other lure company that makes something similar?  Thanks.
569922,Pikeslayer,2011-04-07 15:30:00,1443,Yo-Zuri Sashimi lures???
569925,Nipfisher,2011-04-07 15:34:00,2449,Lots of countdowns still available on line through e-bay and other sites. I may have a few good links for you. PM me if interested?
569934,spyder3g,2011-04-07 15:57:00,50,True There are plenty of Count Downs everywhere.  Just search http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_npmv=3&_trksid=m570&_nkw=Rapala+Countdowns
569938,JoshS,2011-04-07 16:21:00,729,"Discontinued? I didn't know.. and I just picked up a few at a local shop last weekend. Guess rapala just doesn't sell enough of them anymore.  Check out the recent in fisherman mag, there is an article on countdown style baits that shows some varieties."
570189,singingdog,2011-04-08 10:13:00,1047,That is a shame. The countdown minnow must not be sexy enough for todays market. I am going to stock up....the small countdown in a certain color is the best speck/laker lure I have found to date.
570195,cuzza,2011-04-08 11:53:00,467,Are you sure? It's still on the Rapala site http://www.rapala.com/products/lures/countdown/
570203,super dave,2011-04-08 12:39:00,323,I guess your right Cuzza.  I guess I was misinformed.  Sorry about that everyone.  Some pretty good deals on ebay.  I have a lot of success with them with river smallies.  Thinking of summer already!
570475,singingdog,2011-04-09 10:24:00,1047,"Yea, I think that it was a false alarm. I checked with my local tackle shop and they can still get them."
570515,adempsey,2011-04-09 17:48:00,1498,I have a feeling you were only premature.   My guess is Rapala will eventually migrate all their lures over to the Rap style plastic design.
570651,gone_fishin,2011-04-10 01:44:00,481," you're probably right... but will they ACTUALLY do away with the ""Original"" Rapala??? i'm not so sure..."
570896,kickingfrog,2011-04-10 23:55:00,8333,"As JoshS mentioned, the May 2011 In-Fishermen has an article about countdowns and other options.  The article isn't on line yet, but might be at some point.  The article mentions: Salmo minnows, Rebel Tracdown minnow, Sebile sinking Koolie minnow.  Yo-Zuri has a few options: sinking Crystal minnow, L minnow, SW Pin's Minnow, Pin's minnow magnet."
