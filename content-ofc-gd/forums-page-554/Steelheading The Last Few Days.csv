570538,archie_james_c,2011-04-09 20:07:00,618,  Centerpinning...you know...thats when guys put fly reels on there NOODLE RODS duh...
570545,misfish,2011-04-09 20:34:00,29133, Does this mean you will be getting into pin reel fishing too Roy?
569829,WeedLine,2011-04-07 02:22:00,322,"Looks like a good time, well done. Nice brown too"
569859,archie_james_c,2011-04-07 03:45:00,618,Sick report as usual Solo. Hopefully I'll get some steelhead on my PIN this spring
569900,corvette1,2011-04-07 13:12:00,1765,great report mike congrats on the steel
569937,JoshS,2011-04-07 16:14:00,729,Inspirational report. Love the spring brownies. Thanks!
570002,spinnerdoc,2011-04-07 20:39:00,556,"awesome mike, funny i had this conversation with a friend and i have always taken the same aproach as you, if i bought them they are gonna be put to the test.... even more if i made them  i know people with sticks not even seing a reel on it.same with reels never being spooled with line"
570019,spinnerdoc,2011-04-07 21:42:00,556,well what i dont get is paying that much and letting gather dust or baby it too much. imo it's a waste to pay so and so money if the reels fishes you instead of you fishing the reel
570021,canadadude,2011-04-07 21:50:00,769,"3 FOR 4 today at port D 1 steelhie 2 browns drop bounced all the fish, drop bouncing means you bottom bounce traditionally but open your bail to hit the fish you think are stacked up. No fished were got except for mine, drop bouncing, so hey you guys think you got it figured out you don't know squat, come on down to port D and let some one learn you. hahhahhaha"
570037,canadadude,2011-04-07 22:58:00,769,Don't matter on OFC about fish'in techiques and such this board gets more hits on the latest CBC news and bull crap stats......is it possible for the keepers to maybe bring it back to FISHING....IT'S A FISHING SITE not a hug me/ I love you site....is it all possible to get member's into fishing and slash the lovey clique crap.
570042,BillM,2011-04-07 23:29:00,17367,Proper english and a wee bit more attention to grammar would really be appreciated by all of us trying to decyfer what the hell you're trying to say.
570055,solopaddler,2011-04-08 00:03:00,8605,    How ironic.  It's exactly this type of response that made me stop posting reports last fall.
570057,Skud,2011-04-08 00:11:00,739,Great fish pics Mike. How'd they taste?
570058,mercman,2011-04-08 00:12:00,7054,  cliques....what Cliques  you have to gleen through the cliques and pick up on all the great info shared by the members who really know fishing.
570059,canadadude,2011-04-08 00:13:00,769,"Sorry  proper enlglish and grammar is needed for poor Bill to decfyer what I`m trying to say, I made my piont I hope other members get it......sorry BILLM Troll I only have a grade 13 and college graduate education, again why dosn`t OFC regaurd to fishing and let this guy attack me"
570060,rock34,2011-04-08 00:19:00,215," Dude - Not sure how you got to this point Both BillM and Solo are not only solid contributors to this board but stand up, excellent fishermen. You initiated this agrument out of nowhere....not sure what your deal is but you might as well move on."
570062,canadadude,2011-04-08 00:30:00,769,"Ironi.....hey solo, don;t let your ego get involoved with posts, post your catches and laugh at me and the rest of us. We like to screw with you because we want to live your life. It`s just jealously dude, how ironic hahahha"
570065,BillM,2011-04-08 00:34:00,17367," I think you started with the insults back on page 2.  If you can dish it out, you should also be able to take it.  Apparently you can't."
570066,Roy,2011-04-08 00:35:00,13728,"Canadadude, in the number of years you've been here you've never posted a report....never even have you posted a positive remark to anyone. Your Momma would be ashamed and rightly so. Take a break. Let the community talk of what it wants to talk about in harmony. We don't have time to babysit supposed adults.  edited to add: And now that I know you've read this, you won't be needing a PM from me."

570072,GBW,2011-04-08 00:46:00,8460,"wow, way to trash a great report canadadud.  I look forward to any day I can fish with any of the standup members of this board.  I would be VERY happy to get a few hours out with Solo, BillM, Irish, Terry and SOOOOOOOOO many others that I read posts from and PM back and forth.  I'm happy as hell to know and have fished with the OFC'ers that I have fished with.  Hence the site's name having Community in it.  I gather dud is on modQ or banned so take it as you read it.  It's a COMMUNITY where we share info about fishing, remorse, feelings and then bach to fishing. End of semi-rant.  geoff"
570078,archie_james_c,2011-04-08 00:49:00,618,  Pffft Solo and BillM are hacks anyways...they probably dont even own a center pin              
570080,Roy,2011-04-08 00:51:00,13728,No worries guys. Post what you like and we'll fix the thread to not offend anyone in the next while.
570082,GBW,2011-04-08 00:54:00,8460,"that's easy, remove the toxins from the site..."
570084,BillM,2011-04-08 00:54:00,17367,"I'm done Roy, sorry if things got a wee bit heated.  My apologies to Mike for ruining his thread, lol.  Archie, a center what?"
570090,MJL,2011-04-08 01:01:00,2427,Very pretty fish Mike.  Always a pleasure reading your reports.  That Paine falls reel looks like it could be that new toy I just have to have   ...And it comes in stealth fighter black too...Just the way I like it
570129,spinnerdoc,2011-04-08 02:08:00,556,"I share Billm's opinion, you need to speak proper English."
569093,Leecher,2011-04-04 23:18:00,7832,"Good god.... you certainly got them steels dialed in Sweet reward for your effort Mike Thanks for sharing!!!  P.S.  Was checking the QMNR site today and looks like they have set a slot size for walleye     Up here in zone 10, between 37cm and 53cm are keepers     anything below or above must go back  Just thought I pass on the info cause I know you have a cottage up North of Quebec, check it out  QMNR Site  Jacques"
569097,solopaddler,2011-04-04 23:28:00,8605,  Jacques my camp is in zone 13 west. No slot implemented there unfortunately.  Limit is still 6 but they've upped the minimum size by 2cm.  An absolute joke and a very dissapointing decision in what's a very heavily fished area.  At least I still have my back lakes.
569107,canadadude,2011-04-04 23:40:00,769,"Hey Solo....I gotta a join the 20th freaking centry and join the centerpin crew hahahhaahhaa......it's just to much like perch & crappie fish'in, I like bottom bouncing a pool, or dift....it's like a wierd ole school thing for me, I mean steelheading was such and art before pins&floats and now every dude gets a $700 set-up and is a steelheader.I fished steelhead up north for 20yrs, I walk into a pool now and bottom bounce I'm the idiot, untill I limit out twice hahahhaaha.It 's a different game out there now, never under estimate the value of a good bottom bouncer hahahhah"
569110,Leecher,2011-04-04 23:42:00,7832, I wasn't sure about the zone your camp was.... just checked and your right.... no change     I just never thought it would get to this in my zone.... ah well... looks like a measuring device will now have to be part of the tackle box when fishing
569112,HTHM,2011-04-04 23:44:00,4082,"Regarding the way that Solo treats his CENTERPIN (is that the correct term ??) I figure he has done this a lot more than I have and may know a thing or two about what he is doing... And dang, those is some mighty fine looking fish. Probably still swimming too. thanks Mike!"
569116,BillM,2011-04-04 23:51:00,17367,Damn pinners.
569124,solopaddler,2011-04-05 00:02:00,8605, I'm not disagreeing with you. Everyone who picks up a centrepin these days is an instant hero.  It's just another tool in the box for me.  I bottom bounce and throw hardware all the time. Whatever conditions dictate.    I have taught you well grasshopper.
569125,Rod Caster,2011-04-05 00:03:00,5784,"Keep these posts coming Solo, your recent reports have been fantastic....especially for this time of year when things are slow."
569132,limeyangler,2011-04-05 00:13:00,5204,I'm jealous......  Great stuff Mike.  quality pictures...quality fish.
569141,canadadude,2011-04-05 00:29:00,769,"not to get off topic, but all our fish in niagara are still swimming, the tricks down here are weight control. Lots of guys come down here and can't hook-up because you think bottom bouncing is as simple as putting on pencile sinker and bouncing bottom.The secret is to carry a variety of lead, somtimes I bounce bell weights, somtimes round ball, sometimes lindy weights, sometimes penciles. Not only is the size of the weight important but the presentation from the  weight is big time important. When I fish Port D or the Niagara I carry 3 or 4 different types of 3/4 and 1 oz weights, my drift from a bell is diferent then my drift from a pencil.I get a more agrresive bounce from a pencle weight, less agressive from a ball, lindy weight or bell some where inbetween. Somtimes in norhtern tiribs I used to run only shot, I've changed to running 3/8 and 1/2 bottom bouncing lindy sinkers, I'll go dowm to 1/8 oz but the secret is to get the bounce.Bottom boucncing is an art form not many steel headers still do it, but is as good if not better then pinning, the problem is reach a pool and 10 guys are pinning what do you do? Sneak in check out the drift and weight, cast to the sweet spot bottom bounce your fish( it only takea a cast) then let the pinners damn around hahhahahahaha"
569142,BillM,2011-04-05 00:31:00,17367,I bottom bounce all the time with my centerpin.   Just because it's under a float doesn't mean it can't bounce across the bottom
569154,rock34,2011-04-05 00:54:00,215,"Oh No…..I just opened OFC and there it is, another post from Solopaddler.  This is the point where I ask myself…….”Do I really want to open this knowing that with one click of the mouse comes the feelings of envy, the emotion of jealousy and an ensuing depression?”.  Yet every time I ask myself this, it makes no difference, I click the mouse.  As always I will lose sleep tonight wondering how and when and if, one day I will have enough steelhead knowledge to constantly have days like this.  As always Mike..........AMAZING!"
569159,canadadude,2011-04-05 01:06:00,769,"True but thats a float zinging under while you smashing bottom is not the presentation you want, a float hinders the bounce. Bottom bouncinig corectly is a science my friend, it takes alot of drifts and knowing whats happening on thise drifts. It may look easy when I'm hooking-up but sometimes it aint so easy thats why some days I get 8-10 fish and others go home.If your float is hooking on bottom your not getting crap, if I'm bouncing right I'm catching thats a fact dude.Float fishing is a science aswell, you need the right drop and such, it's the same bottom bouncing, no different the key to the whole thing is give the fish the bait they want to hit. Whether your bottom bouncing, Center Pinning, throwing spoons, spinners......the key to the big game is getting the fish to hit. We may all go about differently, some like it that way....others this way it all ends up thr same ENJOYMENT"
569162,BillM,2011-04-05 01:12:00,17367,"If your float is 'zinging' under anytime you touch bottom you are A) either running way to long, or  You have way to much weight and it's not setup correctly.  On certain rivers you can run shot close to your bait and not hang up (Lake Erie south shore tribs for example) where the bottoms are fairly clear and not to snaggy.  Do that on the Notty and you'll have a very crappy day.  Different rivers call for different setups (obviously), but if you think I'm running 1-2ft above bottom and not just tumbling along like you are, you'd be wrong."
569163,solopaddler,2011-04-05 01:16:00,8605,"Bill, running a long lead under your float and ticking bottom is not bottom bouncing.   Rock I think we need to get out together again soon.  Easy on the platitudes."
569167,BillM,2011-04-05 01:23:00,17367,By bottom bounce I mean 'bouncing my bait along the bottom'
569187,canadadude,2011-04-05 01:53:00,769,"Dude's I fish Port Dalhousie & the Niagra..so I bottom bounce, guys from toronto to london come down hereing how good the fishing is thinking all you gotta do is throw on pencile weight and fishing is great.Then they  get here and the fishing sucks, but I got 3 or 4 Why because I'm running round ball weight, different drift from the round ball, slower, what ever its diferent. Somtmes I run bells, or bottom bouncers, I always change because I get a different drift, if there not hitting change up after i go through different weights and no hits it's time to go home hahahahhaa. Bottom bouncing is the same up north, there's agresive bouncing and not....lots of times you just know by the water, but that will you fool you. Trust me the thing is trouties are no harder catch then perch,just learn their crap"
569192,canadadude,2011-04-05 01:57:00,769,you don't have clue......another perch fisher turned steelheader thanks to floating

Me thinks if I showed up at the river with my baitcaster and a flip`n stick the Dude may toss me in the river!!!   HAHAHAHAAAAAAHAAAAAHAA"
568915,solopaddler,2011-04-04 11:56:00,8605,"Fished all over the map recently fishing Wed, Fri and Sat last week. From 3 hours north to 2 hours south in waters ranging from muddy to glass water clear.  Fish were caught in good numbers everywhere. They're on the prod right now, get out if you can!  Here's a handful of the best pic's:                       Cheers"

568942,Victor,2011-04-04 13:47:00,1609,Weather was great these past few days. Only thing that would have made it better was that if i actually hooked into a fish haha.  Great pics as always Mike!
568952,frozen-fire,2011-04-04 14:20:00,542,"Beautiful fish Mike. A lot of dropbacks?  I notice you dunk your reel in the water quite a lot. With my old Islander, I found that whenever it was submerged, it would spin poorly afterwards. I guess maybe the water I've been fishing had too much sediment in it. I try my best to keep my reel out of the water now."
568958,solopaddler,2011-04-04 14:47:00,8605," A mix of dropbacks and loose fish actually. Havn't seen a tight fish in a while.  Yeah I definitely don't baby my equipment. It gets clogged with grit all the time. Assuming it's not below zero a quick dunk and spin in the river takes care of it.  So many guys lay their reel down on a velvet pillow streamside, makes me laugh."

Again, NICE FISH  Bob"
569012,BillM,2011-04-04 20:03:00,17367,"  Bob, there are a few rivers around you that fish REALLY well after a rain.  Next time you think it's going to blow out, at least go down and take a look.  You might be surprised"
569014,Billy Bob,2011-04-04 20:21:00,5865," Bill, your probably right.....it's just not my thing as much as boat fishing...and when I was a kid stream fishing is all I ever did...go figure..."

569050,canadadude,2011-04-04 21:58:00,769,"I don't get it is it normal for pinners to stuff $500 reels $ $500 rods under water to get a pic, I see so many posts of use guys shoving your reels underwater or in the sand, I use a spinning reel stradic, wiskers and such and I would never think of it hitting the sand. In fact I'd rather drop a fish then let it get screwed in the sand, yet pinners have no problem droping $500 in the river for a pic , I don't get it, to each his own"

569071,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-04 22:43:00,10439," There's a lot less to get messed up on a pin than there is a baitcaster or spinning reel. Heck it's a back, pin, spool and a couple of bearings. Just dip it under water and give it a spin and any grit is gone. As for the rod the worst that could happen is the wood on the reel seat could temporarily swell and make it difficult to remove the reel until it dries out.  Jeebas man it's not made of sugar you know.    :rofl2:"
569076,Rod Caster,2011-04-04 22:49:00,5784,"That got my blood pounding!! Nice fish, can't wait till I can get a shot at some steel action."
569080,canadadude,2011-04-04 22:58:00,769,"Good answer...hey I'm not a pinner, I'm still an ole style bottom bouncer( lost art I might add), but I still can't see me droping a $300 reel in the sand, perhaps and probably because I don't fish one. I appologise to all the pinners who drop there crap in the river hahahahahaha"
569081,solopaddler,2011-04-04 23:05:00,8605,"  The only thing you need to apologise for is using the word ""pinner"".  Every time I hear it I barf in my mouth a little bit."

Don't change a thing my friend, I just wanted to coment on the pin thing, but I would still personally like to say your doing alright my friend, 2 thumbs up.It may not mean much but, from your posts and such your doing alright big time. Don't change a thing and I hope you intrust alittle of that solo into your sweet kids, that will be a blessing to our world !!!!!  feel free to drown your pin in any steelhead stream hahahah"
