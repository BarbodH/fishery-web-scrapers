570648,Loonietoon,2011-04-10 01:41:00,1450,Was impressed with Mike's Booth with his Handlebars Baits.. Had to leave before I could buy a few. The people I was with just wanted to leave before me and they were driving

570817,SlowPoke,2011-04-10 20:38:00,2984,"Another great show and thanks to everyone involved.  I couldn't be happier for Mike; HandleBarz made a big splash at the show! Between a ton of baits donated to the prize table and nearly selling out his display, I think everyone went home with some!  "
570830,Rich Clemens,2011-04-10 21:11:00,3131,Attboy Mike.   You do make some great looking baits.  Hope the show was a success for you.
570876,Handlebarz,2011-04-10 23:31:00,3790,Thanks Everyone it was a great weekend for sure. It was very nice to meet up with so many friends from OFC here and to meet up with new ones. I wish I had more time to talk with everyone and felt that sometimes I was a little to short on time. I love talking as many know and even more when it has to do with fishing. The families that were there was great to see as alot of kids were getting lures for the up coming season I had the pleasure to talk with many future musky hunters and here there stories it was the best part for me.  In the picture that Brian took we were completing a order for a store up in Kenora this place is HUGE and has a massive selection of musky stuff enough that everyone can get in trouble in his store no matter who you are. http://www.facebook.com/pages/Figure-8-Baits/157166047643575  The pleasure was all mine for the fishing talk thanks again to everyone for supporting Handlebarz and especially Muskies Canada as with out the fishermen and women coming out to this event MCI could not put it on.  Cheers Mike  Oh yeah here is the booth at the end of the day it was nice to not pack everything to go home.
