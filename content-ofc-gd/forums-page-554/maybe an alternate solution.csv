570365,irishfield,2011-04-08 23:18:00,26272,"Looks like someone else has tapped into the free government ""green fund"" handouts!"
570366,Terry,2011-04-08 23:21:00,14456,yeah I am sure some yuppies would buy that   are there still yuppies?
570367,Roy,2011-04-08 23:22:00,13728,Try selling that to the bass tournament guys.  and edited to add: Where's the landfill for the batteries?
570368,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 23:22:00,0,  Love to see a Bass tourney with those being used...
570370,aplumma,2011-04-08 23:27:00,6896,they show up at the marina on sailboat dingies mostly down here.   Art
570371,mercman,2011-04-08 23:28:00,7054,"Well i admit, you wont find it moored at the Redneck Yacht Club, but for an electric, its still pretty impressive.If you looked caredfully, there is only 1 battery in the boat."
570373,ChrisK,2011-04-08 23:30:00,2772,That solar panel would make a heck of a casting platform
570379,aplumma,2011-04-08 23:42:00,6896,I actually though the panel was hung wrong if it was over the boat you would be in the shade as you sipped you favorite pink drink with an little umbrella.   Art
570380,Roy,2011-04-08 23:43:00,13728," And if you thought more carefully, you'd know that many people would mean more batteries."
570387,mercman,2011-04-09 00:14:00,7054,"A marine battery is 100% recyclable, a gallon of gas is gone in 60 seconds    Boss"
570393,Roy,2011-04-09 00:32:00,13728,"Yeah, ok Paul...don't want to argue that one. .... but I could."
570394,mercman,2011-04-09 00:34:00,7054,i know you could Roy and you would be right too
570396,Jer,2011-04-09 00:38:00,1426,It looked like it was pretty well out of juice by the end...
570416,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-09 02:03:00,4399, No worries there Roy can`t see them selling!!
570417,HTHM,2011-04-09 02:07:00,4082,If it got the boat up on plane I'd be impressed.
570423,craigdritchie,2011-04-09 02:18:00,1586," Unfortunately, the power required to generate enough electricity to recharge that battery overnight still represents a pretty large carbon footprint, whether the electricity comes from a coal-fired power plant or a nuke plant. There's no free lunch.  Having said that, electric motors will continue to develop. I got to drive an electric ski boat a few weeks ago when I was at the Miami boat show. It was an 18-foot fibreglass Ski Nautique, with a power system designed by a company from Quebec. It had no problem getting on plane, and actually did 40 mph on a GPS - fastest I've ever been in an electric boat by far. Battery life wasn't the best, but hey, it's a start.  Edit: Here's a link to a YouTube video of the boat I drove."
570426,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-09 02:21:00,4399, curious Craig what was the battery life and how big was the battery?
