Oh well...fishing was good....only fished for 2.5 hrs as my older son wasn't feeling well today...got 3 fish on.....lost 2 and landed one brown....not bad start of the soft water season....41 degrees, 10 fow....lots of marks too....got fish on body baits and on spoons./...on boards and on rigger....
