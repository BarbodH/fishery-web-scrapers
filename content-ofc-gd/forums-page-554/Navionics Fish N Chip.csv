569368,bucont,2011-04-06 00:40:00,20,I am looking at the purchase of one of these chips for my GPS on my boat. Can anyone tell me if there is a seperate navionics chips for different manufactures like Humminbird and Lowrance?
569395,moosehead,2011-04-06 01:35:00,90,"I think they are compatible with all brands, i have one that i had for a lowrance that is now in a humminbird, works fine"
569817,bucont,2011-04-07 01:39:00,20,Got it ... Thanks
569818,cranks bait,2011-04-07 01:45:00,721,I've got one of these somewhere in my basement.  I cannot get it to work with my unit.  I think they are only good in the us?
569985,Woodsman,2011-04-07 19:21:00,1286,That's not the case. Just make sure you get a chip that is for the area you want & is compatible with your Fishfinder/GPS.
569988,Woodsman,2011-04-07 19:30:00,1286,Definitely not all brands are compatible. Most Humminbirds & Lowrances are good though. The new Fish'N Chip is not generally good for Eagles though.
570001,Billy Bob,2011-04-07 20:26:00,5865,Go on Navionics website and check if that particular chip is compatible with the unit you intend to use it in.....for example my LMS 520C unit will work with a Navionics Premium chip but not their newer Platinum chip that the HDS units will accept. So it's best to make sure because you can't return them  Bob
570010,Dara,2011-04-07 21:05:00,3052,Why are you going fish n chip...I'm looking at it as well and a pro fisherman is telling me the Gold is the way to go. He doesn't like the screen display on fishnchip
570125,bucont,2011-04-08 01:57:00,20,"I generally fish the great lakes, huron, st clair and erie plus add the Detroit and st Clair rivers both US and CDN sides. My understanding is the coverage on this SD is better for the areas I fish."
