568811,TDunn,2011-04-04 00:55:00,680,Not much of a report to read but I do have some pictures to share!        Video- landing rainbow  Chillin around the fire!         My only whitie one long afternoon        My favourite eats!        Seen some elk just east of the Soo last week. There was a big bull that I wish I could of taken a picture of but couldn't stop in time. I did manage a blurry pic of a few others. It was taken out the window of a moving vehicle....    Also had this guy flying around us for awhile getting ready for the upcoming forest fire season  Water Bomber  Bring on the open water!  TDunn

568921,solopaddler,2011-04-04 12:15:00,8605,"Cool Tyler, rainbows through the ice aren't all that common.  I've seen Elk a couple times S/W of Sudbury while fishing the Bad River area. I think there's a release site in that general vicinity.  Nice to see they're gaining a foothold."
