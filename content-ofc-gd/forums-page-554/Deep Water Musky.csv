He fishes 80-100 fow.  I guess its a summer thing when the water heats up.  Im assuming 10"" or bigger baits.  I might put out one line for trout and the other higher up for musky.  looking for info online but cant find any info on fishing deeper than say 30 feet.  thanks"
570253,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-08 16:51:00,2050,I'm not a musky guy but my bet is that most hardcore musky guys would be worried about the fish surviving after being dragged up out of colder deeper water in a hurry.... could be completely wrong but I've seen eyes pop strait out of smallies in super deep water.
570257,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-08 17:12:00,0,  The last fish I saw caught on riggers did not survive. It was a shame to watch a 50 plus not swim away even with all the effort  the guys went through trying revive it.  Why target two different fish at once? Stick to one and get good at it.
570460,mike rousseau,2011-04-09 05:53:00,4661,I think it's more of tge muskie suspending in deep water only 0-30 feet down... I know a spot where the Muskie jump on a regular basis over 70 feet if water...  It's like walleye on boq... 130 feet deep but the fish can be only 10 feet down sometimes...
570499,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-09 14:55:00,0,Keep thinking about it    but targeting them in deep water is the issue.

570701,Rizzo,2011-04-10 12:29:00,4754,I can only afford 30 feet of powerpro (especially after yesterday's Odyssey!) so that's as deep as I fish
570706,outllaw,2011-04-10 12:52:00,1232,the majority of active muskies are in the top of the water column.. we fall fish muskies up to 40ft. water temps are the same here from top to bottom... if your truly want more action fish the top 12 ft for this water is normally the warmest. preferred temps are different for skies other then salmonoids.
570898,Pigeontroller,2011-04-10 23:57:00,2793,Muskies will not likely survive if brought up from below (1 ATM) 33 feet.
