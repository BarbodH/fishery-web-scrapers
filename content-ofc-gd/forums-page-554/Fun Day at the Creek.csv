The day started out with meeting chefboi17 & caster. They brought a friend with them, it was his first time float fishing. After about an hour of them catching only suckers , they decided to move up stream. I stayed at the same hole, in hopes to catch something. Chefboi17 gave me a jar with about 6 roe in it. I tried the pink worm, nothing. I tied on a fly, nothing. Switched over to the roe,and first cast i had a small rainbow. It was small but it was a bow. A couple minutes later bam, line peels out. Good fight going on and i was pumped. Got it about 7 feet from shore and it surfaced,with the unmistakable brown color on its belly. Yup, it's a sucker, but it IS a fish and it did put up a fight so that's good with me. The next couple hours did not disappoint. With every hit i was hoping for a nice rainbow. But every hit was a sucker. I did get 1 bow on but lost it near the shore.  To sum it up, I was out fishing, met up with 2 other guy's from the board, had a ton of fun catching fish, and brought home 3 suckers to entice someone here to take me out for some of those huge cats down in Dunville."

570167,dhickey,2011-04-08 03:50:00,1038,thought you were to tierd from catching fish today. big cats next wknd.  
570181,chefboi17,2011-04-08 05:21:00,128,"hey skeeter, it was nice meeting you today, those big suckers sure filled the day nicely, considering i lost the one steelie i hooked into all day. the way the suckers were smashing my maribou jig makes me think i need to replace my busted fly tying vice so i can whip up some more. heck, maybe i'll bring an ultralight rod and target those bronze back bottom dwellers lol. good luck with the dunville kitties bud, and done forget the report"
570211,Rainbow Darter,2011-04-08 13:13:00,8,"HEy a fish is a fish is a fish, especially over a LONG winter.  Coarse fish get such a bad rap. They bite readily, grow big, and fight hard.  I want to try hitting the sucker run! In spring I usually target Panfish first time out, so I have no idea where to even start for sucker or what rivers are open to fish...  Please PM me on any info you can share  Thank You"
570231,ricoboxing,2011-04-08 14:16:00,398,catching a sucker is better then staying home and not fishing
570239,BillM,2011-04-08 15:03:00,17367,"If it's a slow day out on the river, I never complain if the suckers are to play"
570308,misfish,2011-04-08 20:43:00,29133," I wouldnt complain either.Good practice.  You got out Skeet,all that matters.  TFS"
570437,young_one,2011-04-09 03:04:00,620,"Excuse me for not blurring the background, I know someone recognize that sand and waterline!   Skeeter has the cardio of a 21 years old! Someone fish with him tomorrow, so he can ironman a 3 day fishing marathon!  "
570487,BillM,2011-04-09 13:08:00,17367,You guys get any small ones?  Great for spring pike!!!
570489,Bly,2011-04-09 13:15:00,1556,Nice going Skeeter! Nice to have any fish on the end of your line
570503,mercman,2011-04-09 16:09:00,7054,Well done Dann !!! do you actually eat those things? Never tried them What are they comparable too in taste?  
570508,skeeter,2011-04-09 16:55:00,1907,"In answer to your question mercman, NO I am sure that there are people out there that eat them, but not me.LOL But then again, i guess you could say yes cause a lot of people throw them in the garden soil for fertilizer."
570527,Garnet,2011-04-09 19:24:00,2056,Had canned sucker from old guy down at the river. Tasted fine bones were like can salmon. Didn't buy a caner.
