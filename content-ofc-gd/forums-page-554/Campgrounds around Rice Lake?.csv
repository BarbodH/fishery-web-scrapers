570256,crossover,2011-04-08 17:00:00,172,"So, we always did our camping in May at Serpent Mounds Park, but it's closed for renovations this year. Does anyone know another park? We have a small trailer, and I would like to try my luck at walleye this year, so a park in a general location where I can find walleye not too far (I will be kayaking) would be great."
570268,crossover,2011-04-08 18:03:00,172,"Really though, any campground with access to walleye at a max of 2 hours from Toronto is fair game."
570301,adempsey,2011-04-08 20:02:00,1498,"Many of the resorts have camp sites.  You can check here: http://www.ricelakecanada.com/amenities.htm and this one http://www.islandspiritsricelake.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=76  Personally I prefer Pigeon Lake for fishing.  Emily Provincial Park is at the south end of the lake, although I never really ventured down that far south.  I am sure a lot of resorts on Pigeon also have camp sites.  Here is a map showing some parks and conservation areas: http://www.gpaedc.on.ca/pdf/resources-maps/peterborough-county-map.pdf"
570305,crossover,2011-04-08 20:33:00,172,"Thanks, I'll look into Emily."
570324,tb4me,2011-04-08 21:31:00,3295,"Try Coles point resort north of campbellford..its on the trent river. Great eye fishing, nothing big but lots of good fishing in general..             www.colespoint.ca Good luck no matter where you end up!"
570327,Michael_Brown,2011-04-08 21:36:00,411,"There are some excellent resorts that offer camping in addition to cottages and trailers. Check out the Rice Lake Fishing Festival website for more information.  http://www.ricelakespringfishingfestival.ca/?q=packages  I know Tower Manor Lodge, Alpine Resort, Silver Leaf and Golden Beach resort offer camping and are all in perfect locations to access the fantastic walleye fishing on Rice Lake. If you have not fished Rice lake much in the last couple of years your missing out. The walleye fishing has been amazing. The lake seems to be full of 2-3lb fish. Plus if you come up in the spring during the festival you just might catch one of the tagged prize fish for your chance at $69,000.00 in prizes."
570355,tschirk,2011-04-08 22:56:00,261, I have stayed at Golden Beach Resort a few times and would recommend it. Nice place. Good lake access....
570421,Homer Is King,2011-04-09 02:17:00,305,Last year we stayed at Tower Manor Lodge on the south shore of Rice Lake down near Bewdley.  http://towermanorlodge.com/  It's a smaller campground and not as fancy as some of the others around the lake but the rates are good.  The pools awesome.  The pan fish are plentiful right off the dock.
570428,Guest LivingLegend,2011-04-09 02:22:00,0,"  I agree, Pigeon has done me well. Rice Lake? Well............not so good but giverrrrr a try and prove me wrong. I aswell kayak fish too, what's your ride crossover?"
570432,Ron,2011-04-09 02:30:00,1683,"  I recommend Golden Beach to everyone as well. Centrally located on the lake and a great weed line not 400 metres from shore to the deep water edge side. Follow that weedline and I guarantee you will catch walleye.   Cheers, Ron..."
570434,crossover,2011-04-09 02:36:00,172," It's an inflatable kayak, almost resembling a mini raft. It's called a Musquash, although I can't find any pictures of it online since it was a model that apparently came with planes. I'll definitely post pics after the trip.   Thanks for the tip! How far is the water from the trailer site?"
570436,Ron,2011-04-09 02:44:00,1683, It's less than a stone throw on some of their sites.
570482,Michael_Brown,2011-04-09 11:44:00,411,"Last couple of years it seems like any weed line in 6-10 feet of water was a sure thing for walleye. A crankbait early or late in the day casting the edges. Or a jig anytime worked along the weed line. From the opener on May 14 until mid-June the walleye fishing was hot. The key for me seemed to be to look for weedbeds that were ""alive"" and by that I mean lots of life in the form of bugs. minnows, panfish, etc. Plus the bonus was that these same weedbeds always keep you busy with action. If the walleye bite slows, your still hammering Crappie or Perch or Blue Gills.  I hope you enjoy your camping trip."
570494,Banger68,2011-04-09 14:13:00,157,"I stayed a couple times at Bensford Bridge Resort on the Otanabee River. I was fishing out of my canoe then. Lots of Bass, several Walleye, and Muskie in paddling distance. Was a decent price and a good family park. There are sites a stone throw from the water. But it's been a few years since I was there."
570507,crossover,2011-04-09 16:53:00,172,"Reserved a spot on Emily PP. The only thing I didn't like about Golden beach was: "" We are happy to take requests on sites but unfortunately unable to guarantee a site until arrival."""
570512,adempsey,2011-04-09 17:33:00,1498," Personally, I found Golden Beach way too busy.  I would have suggested anywhere else with a campground instead.   Not that it makes any difference now =)  Hope you have a good time on Pigeon Lake.   The lake is relatively shallow at that end so you may have to travel up the lake a bit, but it's been some time since I was there in May so I am not sure where the Walleye will be holding."
570524,crossover,2011-04-09 18:30:00,172,How about the carp on pigeon lake?
570576,Homer Is King,2011-04-09 22:21:00,305,We go to Pigeon yearly. It's a really nice park. The sites are private and the beach is really good considering it's on the Pigeon river.  I looked into Golden Beach before as well. For my family of 6 they wanted over $100 per night!
