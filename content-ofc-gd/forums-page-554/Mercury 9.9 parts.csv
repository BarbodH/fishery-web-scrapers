570712,jim,2011-04-10 13:04:00,124,So I take the motor in for a check up. I'd had cold start problems last summer.  The guy tells me that I need a new lower ignition module as I have no spark to the lower cylinder.  $5oo. bucks to fix.  Any thoughts??  The motor is a 1986.

570816,jim,2011-04-10 20:34:00,124," Thanks a lot Drifter, I'll give 'em a try."
570833,Cast-Away,2011-04-10 21:41:00,790,if you are in the GTA I highly recommend taking it to Topgun Marine at Hwy 89 and Hwy 11. Paul the owner is a great guy and won't rip you off.  The price you were given seems awefully high to me.
570849,spoon,2011-04-10 22:13:00,74," Stay away from TopGun Marine as far as possible.  I have friends and pro's that had been doing business with him for a very long time, he was highly recommended by them. Nothing but problems last few years from Paul and his ""crue"". I can write an essay on all the problems that they had, but don't have the time to do it. Its just a warning."
