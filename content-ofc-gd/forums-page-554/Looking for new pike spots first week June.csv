570412,Skud,2011-04-09 01:41:00,739, A 6-8 inch sucker under a float on the edge of a weedline near deep water. Go out with a buddy so you can play cards while you wait for a big Gator to cruise by and slam your bait.

570886,icedude,2011-04-10 23:39:00,459,New Fishing Spots?  maybe check out the new April 2011 Ontario Government site   Fish ON-Line-ontario.ca/fishing     site if you want to explore some new Pike Spots   Good Luck   Tight Lines All   Cheers   ID1
570003,Raycaster,2011-04-07 20:48:00,528,My fishing buddies are looking for a weekend location for the first week of June. We are looking for pike and have hit Cache Bay a few times plus West Arm Nippising and Brit. Had good luck at all the locations but wondering if we're missing a hot spot for early June. By hot spot I mean different lake etc.. of course.  Buckhorn is mainly bass right? Too early?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks guy!
570017,Jer,2011-04-07 21:34:00,1426,"Musky opens on Buckhorn first Saturday in June, too early for the bass though."
570018,GBW,2011-04-07 21:37:00,8460,If you catch a Pike in Buckhorn the MNR want's it!  Pike should not be in that lake as it's a musky lake so the MNR has asked anyone that catches one to keep it and contact them so they can collect it from you.  Just so you know...
570020,Rizzo,2011-04-07 21:47:00,4754,how about manitouwabing?
570027,Raycaster,2011-04-07 22:27:00,528,"Thx for the replies guys!  Didn't know that about Buckhorn...  Last fall we were up in Buckhorn with not much luck but I had what I thought was a average size pike follow my bait to the boat and then run. Your saying it was probably a muskie?  Googling manitouwabing right now...  BTW, I'm not afraid of suggestions of lakes with weeds like Cache Bay. Had a lot of luck there, just nothing big."
570038,GBW,2011-04-07 23:17:00,8460,Canal Lake = pike
570039,BillM,2011-04-07 23:21:00,17367, Don't waste your time.
570049,danc,2011-04-07 23:38:00,4677,N49 50.855  W.88 58.O90. Your arms will be sore for a week after spending a day here.
570052,BillM,2011-04-07 23:46:00,17367, 
570054,canadadude,2011-04-07 23:57:00,769,"Nice answer.....anyway Lakair Lodge has lots of pike action in June, not many monsters but lots of 2-5lb snot rockets with the chance of crunching a monster.There are some bigguns around, there is also a few walleye not far from the lodge in the slot size to give you a fish fry hahahha,  If your looking for good spring pike head to Deaux River on the Ottawa River, June is late for the lunkers....to be honest sept is the month for pike, but june always throws a few lunkers."
570073,Rizzo,2011-04-08 00:47:00,4754, ...usually means you mentionned someone's favorite spot
570076,Raycaster,2011-04-08 00:48:00,528, Not sure if the guys are up to a 2 day trip hauling a boat! Truth is... not sure the wives would allow it 8)
570091,danc,2011-04-08 01:07:00,4677, I appreciate your honesty.
570103,BillM,2011-04-08 01:27:00,17367,"  No, I've fished that lake a lot in my teens.  If you are after snot rockets and a few walleye it's a great lake.  If you are after monsters, seriously go somewhere else"
570108,Rizzo,2011-04-08 01:31:00,4754," strange. I've only fished there a few times (last time was around ten years ago), but each time we caught at least one in the 35+ inch range."
570109,danc,2011-04-08 01:33:00,4677, We call them snot rockets up here.
570113,Rizzo,2011-04-08 01:37:00,4754,"haha, sadly down here its a 22 inch pike with a big appetite"
570116,BillM,2011-04-08 01:40:00,17367,"  We are talking about Manitouabing in Parry Sound correct?  McKellar Township?  I think the only 35+ inch pike I've seen outta there has been a dead one, lol."
570117,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-08 01:40:00,4399,Lake Muskoka has a healthy population of Pike!
570139,craigdritchie,2011-04-08 02:24:00,1586,"Agreed. If I was after monster pike, I sure wouldn't be fishing in southern Ontario in June."
570161,Nipfisher,2011-04-08 03:39:00,2449,"Stick with North Bay but try Nosbonsing, Trout, or Tallon Lakes. All have huge pike. Nosbonsing would have the most #s but Tallon and Trout (including Turtle) have monsters."
570176,dhickey,2011-04-08 04:54:00,1038,what is a monster? the lake i fish has more than a few 3-4 ft range. i put them 16-25 lbs. i see them every once in a while but cant hook them???  any advice?  ps. usualy rainy days in summer or sept/oct.  spring / early summer nothing.  (i think their killing the lake /   its more like a large pond.)  (it takes about 5 mins to go end for end with my 12ft and 6 horse)  what does it take to get them out?  new lures?? new tactics??
570183,blue pickeral,2011-04-08 09:00:00,267," Sounds like our lake. Medium Red Daredevil, bright sunny day, between 12 noon and 3 pm. Yellow '5 diamonds' works as well."
570388,Raycaster,2011-04-09 00:16:00,528, Ah... not to sound too picky but aren't the bugs in NorthBay brutal at the start of June?  Damn... doesn't matter how I write the above sentence... I sound picky!
570390,Nipfisher,2011-04-09 00:17:00,2449,  They are never bad on the lake.
