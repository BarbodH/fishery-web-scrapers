567555,danbouck,2011-03-30 17:28:00,4380, She'll want to come! I'm definitely going no matter what. We will have to figure out the after show beers
567563,aplumma,2011-03-30 18:33:00,6896,Hey T.J. can you please put a can or two in for the food bank from Joe and Myself as we are a little far away. Thanks again to Dave and Subway for all of their efforts.   Art
567814,Dave Mercer,2011-03-31 13:45:00,148,"Hey Gang, Hope all is well with you guys. I am really excited that Subway has asked us to do this tour again. This years version of Facts of Fishing LIVE will be even bigger & better than in the past. This time we have decided to do all the shows in theaters. This will allow for a much bigger crowd & and much better show. If you have never been to a Facts of Fishing LIVE show let me tell you this is not your average fishing seminar. It's the perfect mix of a Fishing Seminar / Rock Show with a little comedy squeezed in. I guess I always wanted to be a rock star or a comedian but was only missing one thing TALENT! So this is our answer to that lol.  Anyways it will be a crazy fun night I am really looking forward to seeing all of you guys & listening to J.P & Paul I always learn something from them. However since we do these events totally FREE we do not spend a bunch of money advertising them. Our goal is to pack each location & as I said we have some pretty big locations to fill this time around. So we need a bunch of butts in the seats. But I really think this will be a great opportunity to promote fishing & get people excited about our great sport of fishing. So we do need your help with spreading the word about these nights. Please help us by posting this event at work or on other boards you may use or on any of your own websites, facebook or twitter. Or even better yet do it the old fashioned way just invite your fishing buddy's out to great, fun & FREE night. Lastly (guys) maybe even tell your bride that you will finally be taking her out to the THEATER for the night like she has always wanted you too (Hey They Are In Theaters)lol.  I hope to see you all there for a good night & please remember to bring a canned food for the local food bank.  Thanks OFC'ers for your help and support as always! Dave"
567847,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-31 15:15:00,2690,"Hoping to make the Kitchener show, after work.  Dan and Ryan, we still have to plan that carp outing"
568959,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-04 14:48:00,2050, Frankie! - You bringing Juli and the boys out the FOF LIVE?  ps. My local carp spots are a mid-summer thing!

566966,grt1,2011-03-28 21:55:00,638,"Hey Dave, if you read this, we have Subway up here in the northwest too.  How about planning a session in Dryden or Kenora so the anglers up here could have the benefit of your knowledge."
567094,HTHM,2011-03-29 01:29:00,4082,"I am going to go to Kitchener, looking forward to it!"

567510,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-30 13:30:00,2050,"Hey Gang!  Ssshhh don't tell the boss - I'm surfin' OFC during work hours...   :whistling:   hah  Anyways, for this year the dates & locations are set!  Without the amazing support from Subway that Dave, and we as a fishing community receive these events wouldn't be possible at all so if you're able to please come on out, have an awesome time and show the good folks at Subway how much we appreciate this opportunity!  They wanted to share the love a little by putting one in Barrie so hopefully some of you guys who are a little farther north of T-dot will make a drive down!  Lookin' forward to 4 days away from the computer, hanging out with my fellow fishing freaks!  Cheers, Ryan"
567518,TJQ,2011-03-30 14:11:00,7806,Ill be at the one in Barrie for sure!!!  
567524,BillM,2011-03-30 14:21:00,17367,Perhaps a little swill after the Barrie event?  I haven't met enough of the fine folks on OFC
567525,TJQ,2011-03-30 14:21:00,7806,How could we NOT have a swill???
567526,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-30 14:22:00,2050," I'm in - I'm not sure when we're leaving for Kitchener, but hopefully we'll be staying in Barrie so I can have a few pops with you guys!"
567531,BillM,2011-03-30 14:55:00,17367," TJ, I should have known this was a prerequisite to a Facts of Fishing Seminar"
567541,danbouck,2011-03-30 15:51:00,4380,"Hopefully I can find a babysitter for the Kitchener show, already need one for the 19th when I see RUSH"
