I havent gotten much info because i wasnt asking the right questions

570169,toca,2011-04-08 03:53:00,274,"just realized he was asking for spots for bass, pike and muskie.  cooksbay lake simcoe for all three categorys and then theres port hope area.  and if all else fails go to metro for some nice rainbows"
