569791,OhioFisherman,2011-04-07 00:04:00,6623,"I have one, but it is like 10+ years old, never had an issue with it. Sort of a unique rod, for a limited time they made a flipping stick with a spinning rod eyes and handle which is what I have. Falcon Lowriders have been popular in this area for a long time."
569821,craigdritchie,2011-04-07 01:51:00,1586,"They sent me a couple of rods a few years ago to try out ... a 6'6"" spinning rod with a straight cork grip and rings, 8 - 15 lb., and a 6'6"" baitcaster, 10 - 20 lb. Nice rods, a bit faster action than I prefer, but everyone's different. They're certainly lightweight. I brought the spinning rod on a Florida trip I did with Mark Kulik, and it worked very well on mangrove snappers and small snook. I have no idea on warranty, because I've had no reason to send either one back."
