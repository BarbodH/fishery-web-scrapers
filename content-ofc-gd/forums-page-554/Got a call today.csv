570050,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-07 23:41:00,10439,To tell me they had a package for me. They take care of FedEx deliveries here in YK. So I goes down and pick it up during lunch. I open it up and lo and behold it's my winnin's from the WFN video contest!!! According to the rules and all the paperwork I had to fill out it was supposed to be a flip ultra video cam standard definition.................well it's the HD version!!!!    I also got a package from the people at IS with my 2010/11 online ice fishin' tourney this week too.    Been a good year so far.

570184,blue pickeral,2011-04-08 09:08:00,267,"I watch Ice Pilots NWT every week, but sometimes chuckle and shake my head. When we lived up there Buffalo was always in hot water about something....once even landing on the highway near Ft. Providence I think it was, as the plane ran out of fuel.  Congrats on the prize and that it got to you."
