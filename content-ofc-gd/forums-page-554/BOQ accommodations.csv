I would prefer honest recommendations as well as warnings via pm only. Details: 8-12 adults male (25 - 50) Require secure overnite mooring for 3-4 boats Clean & comfortable (i mean really clean) Kitchen/cooking facilities Good value  Thanks for your consideration"
570114,Terry,2011-04-08 01:39:00,14456,good luck I have yet to find that place. if there is one there.....
570128,Joey,2011-04-08 02:03:00,9122,"I concur with Terry.  A few nice places, none really clean!!!"
570132,Pikeslayer,2011-04-08 02:11:00,1443,"Ok, let be be more definitive about 'really clean' No mouse turds No spiders Working septic"
570182,mrpike,2011-04-08 08:52:00,151,Check this place out. I stayed there for four summers and I would go back at anytime . Real nice people and very clean and the best docking on the bay.sounds like you would want the main cabin but its really a full cottage large and has all you are looking for. ( www.blakewoodlodge.com )  ITS on the south side of  ( HAY BAY. )   AND the price is right . And the fishing is great in the bay and the main chanel.  PS. THE boat ramp is not the best but it is doable.
