Couldn't have gone any better. I fished a variety of flies under their floats with a small beadhead caddis being by far the most successful.  After working somewhat hard to entice the fish with flies we switched to ye olde garden hackle to put some meat in the cooler.  Still hard to beat a worm.  Please forgive the amateurish videos.  Still, they do tell a story.  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DwG_m9Fjppc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/7UnuEKodFk8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>          My daughter caught fish as well, but refused to touch them LOL!  Great day all around,  Cheers,  Mike"

570711,Terry,2011-04-10 13:02:00,14456,looks like a great day with the kids
570716,solopaddler,2011-04-10 13:15:00,8605, He's already got a float rod and reel.   Still a bit too young to handle it yet though.    Yeah it was pretty funny. He was so excited I thought he'd pee his pants.  Ice has been out for about 3 weeks now I think.
570735,TJQ,2011-04-10 14:37:00,7806,Nice!! Looks like a GREAT Day!
570752,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-10 15:42:00,2690,"Great stuff, Mike!  Love the videos, and, the excitement in the little ones voices! Little stocked trout ponds are where my mom and dad got me hooked on fishing many years ago...most of those places don't stock anymore, but, at least there are opportunities such as this for today's youngsters"
