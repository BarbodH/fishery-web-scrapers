10752,Clampet,2006-12-11 01:59:00,1947,"If walking, swing a 3lb axe medium strenght, and if the axe does not goe cleanly through the ice, then proceed for a couple of steps, then chop again. Even if the water seeps through, it is safe.  Each swing of the axe will clear about 3"" of ice, which is adequate for walking.  If you swing the axe and chop the ice, and the axe goes thru easily, then stop, turn around and resort to plan ""B"" (Go home)."
10915,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-11 16:08:00,2585, I was laughing so loud at this post that my wife asked whats so funny.....needless to say im not laughing anymore.  Cheers!
10946,wolfville,2006-12-11 17:30:00,396,Curling...... it started when people tested ice for ice-fishing.
10957,keram,2006-12-11 18:34:00,585,I wait for the reports from OFC
11196,aplumma,2006-12-12 11:55:00,6896,throw the stick out farther till the Labrador gets wet. Of course you get to smell  warming wet dog in the truck till he dries off.   PS Don't trust this advise it comes from to far south to mean anything.  Art
11205,dwc67,2006-12-12 12:23:00,140,  that was caused by everyone thinking it was a mall parking lot. it was like someone painted on lines  test holes and a spud.....  first ice does not bug me i will fish on three inches but crossing heaved pressure cracks scares me every time
10482,glen,2006-12-10 15:47:00,2641,"How do you test for good ice?  This is what i do.  I walk out on the ice where i know it is only about 2 feet of water then i drill a test hole. If the ice is less than 4"" i go home.  If it is over 4"" i go out a little further and drill another hole.  I stay away from current or other soft spots.  If the ice is in poor condition or thin i drill lots of test holes.  What do you do to test for good ice?"
10491,brifishrgy,2006-12-10 16:02:00,559,wait for you to test the ice and follow your tracks
10494,Fish Farmer,2006-12-10 16:06:00,2234,"Stay away from a river, river mouth, islands, points, and cracks if you don't know the area. Be very careful after a snow fall, you could walk into a hole or crack that has a little skin of ice and the snow has dusted it over."
10500,Dondorfish,2006-12-10 16:08:00,1000,      LOL   Thats funny - thanks   Don
10501,Carp,2006-12-10 16:09:00,1488,"Wait to see Uncle Buck on the ice. If it doesn't break, I may venture out a bit. Better if there's someone with a snowmobile or atv on the ice to reasure me it's safe. I don't like taking chances like that. There's no fish worth losing your life over.  I ain't stupid, just a little crazy !!!"
10503,cisco,2006-12-10 16:12:00,597,"Send a fat guy out first and watch.  Waita minute.... with equal rights and all going on nowadays, send a fat ""person"" out first and see what....  JK!  Good advice above. I hear trappers use an ice spud and tap as they go (tapping the the spud that is, not like in showtunes) and they listen for changes. Drill test holes lots."
10505,Fishitrist,2006-12-10 16:16:00,6,I walk out the first time with a spud and check all the way out.
10518,Tybo,2006-12-10 16:35:00,1373,"Send the wife out first,"
10520,Terry,2006-12-10 16:42:00,14456,she's going to read this
10528,Carp,2006-12-10 16:53:00,1488," Very gutsy statement since she's a board member and will probably read this. If you have a black eye next time I see you, no need to explain."

10543,Rich,2006-12-10 17:06:00,3927,"Toss a filthwich on the ice. Sleded always chases them. If he goes through, I know to wait another couple days."
10544,Ron,2006-12-10 17:11:00,1683,"As a rule of thumb, generally there are other people who have ventured out before hand. If not, I use a 5 lb. spud and punch test holes as I go out."
10545,icewalker28,2006-12-10 17:12:00,39,"i agree with you Glen. Shallow water test hole and go from there. If it isn't thick at shore , it defanitly won't be any farther out. And defanitly stay away from river mouths or any current flow area."
10551,tip-up,2006-12-10 17:19:00,94,"I start by finding safe shoreline then move on from there...Once at my access point to get on the ice I start by wacking the shoreline with a spud bar to make sure there is no air underneath the ice and to ensure I am not going to get a soaker on my first step  ...I then proceed onto the ice with caution( Rope tied to waist via tree and I always hve my ice picks ready wip out incase of any mishap) and wack it a few more times as I make my out...I then drill a hole to confirm ice thickness...If it is over 4'', I will start fishing , if under 4'', then I usually pray for a safe tipppy toe back to shore..  Be safe out there guys!"
10578,irishfield,2006-12-10 18:16:00,26272,"Rocks, the size of bowling balls, painted orange...from 250 feet UP !"
10585,tjsa,2006-12-10 19:08:00,1578,"Don't own a spud, but generally when I get out, others have been out ahead of me. But, in the odd times we are there first, early ice, I use my axe to check the ice. I nice solid whack, you can generally determine the safe areas. If it sounds like a dull thud, give it another few hits. If it sounds like a more solid higher pitched impact, go a few meters more, and hit it again.  You need to be able to identify that sound, and that takes experience. Ummmmmmmm..........bin der, dun dat, got the soaker to prove it, lol."
10589,Photoz,2006-12-10 19:21:00,792,"I wait until I see heavier vehicles than mine out there . . . .     even then I sit on shore, wating for somebody else to go out . . .      I watch their tail lights, if they disappear, I go no further! I like to hear of at least 12"" or more before I go out . . . .      and I'm NEVER first! I suspect it will be mid February BEFORE you see this vehicle 6 klicks off Willow Beach! Anybody else care to estimate when (and IF) Simcoe will be safe right across?  "
10600,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-10 20:07:00,2050,"Yepp, I agree with Photoz - I grew up in Sudbury and I still never walked out until Late January early February sometime, once there's a community of huts and vehicles out there!  UF"
10616,Joey,2006-12-10 20:46:00,9122," I'm sorry to say, Paul has had an unfortunate accident and won't be around for awhile  Actually, I usually walk a few paces behind him when we go  *note to self - update Paul's life insurance policy Monday*  Joey"
10618,irishfield,2006-12-10 20:51:00,26272,I know a good place Joey...no knowledge required on the subjects part that they have a policy on their head....
10628,MuskyBill,2006-12-10 21:11:00,311,"It was rumoured that THIS was caused by a guy testing his new auger close to shore, real early, & then headed out to the deeper areas. All of these guys didn't know about the 'test' holes, & found out the hard way that insurance won't cover stupidity...      That was Gilford, last January 7th...."
10637,BLACKFISH88,2006-12-10 21:40:00,191,Everyone who is thinking about quinte be vary wary this year because the current from all the rain we've had is unreal and I really don't think its gonna change until next summer. I really don't think there is gonna be much ice this year here especially if this weather doesn't start cooperating. Be safe!!!!
10659,Carp,2006-12-10 22:26:00,1488,  We warned you Paul.  Ya hafta be careful whatch ya say round here.
10701,FinS,2006-12-11 00:13:00,463,a spud is the way to go and dont forget the float suit another way to test ice is dont go on it if your not sure of it
