3994,jordan,2006-11-22 21:22:00,136,Iam thinking of getting a center pin for float fishing can anyone suggest any good makes and how they liked it and any dislikes about it i have a spinning reel right now but u just can get as good of a drift with them so any hope u can help me out.     thanks jordan
3996,FishFinder,2006-11-22 21:33:00,481,"I got a Islander Steelheader as my first pin about a month or so ago, I cant say enough god things about it. The spin is amazing and depeding on how much you want to spend it can be had for under 200$ used. It is pretty much the standard for the great lakes. Their customer service is amazing, as the other day i cracked a rose wood reel thing, and they shipped me two new ones free of charge even though its not under warranty.  Now if you have too much money laying around you can go higher such as the Angling Specialties Pins and the Islander Pacific Steelheader, but IMO its not necssary, more for showing off on the river  .  Although dont expect to catch more fish with the Pin, nor land more fish (for the beginning) as it takes some getting used too.  Also casting is a pain untill youve got it right  All in all once you get used to it, you will never go back"
4002,tonyb,2006-11-22 21:47:00,1637,"Check out the Okuma Aventa, it is a fine reel for the money.  Cabelas has them on sale right now for $139.99 U.S.  Don't let people tell you that you need a high-priced reel, unless money is no object for you, they all do the same thing.  Sure some of them might 'start-up' quicker, but for the extra 2 or 300 dollars more I can finger the spool to get it started in those real slow drifts.  I personally use an Okuma, and have caught as much or more fish than guys with the high-priced reels.  Don't forget a long rod, 13 feet is a good length that will work well in most Southern Ontario tributaries.  Cheers, Tony"
4058,canadian_copper,2006-11-22 23:47:00,925,WHAT YA LOOK TO SPEND BRO!!! I GOT REELS FROM 300 UP 1500  LOL
4084,FishFinder,2006-11-23 00:45:00,481,1500  might i ask what reel? ive only seen up to 800
4085,jordan,2006-11-23 00:49:00,136,not that much 1500 wow mabe 300 hundred to start me off    jordan
4086,FishFinder,2006-11-23 00:52:00,481,"345 can get you a new islander, maybe even cheaper if you look around."
4089,ChrisK,2006-11-23 00:57:00,2772,I just bought a Raven....I'm quite happy with it... $250 will get you one off the shelf...
4121,wishn4fishn,2006-11-23 01:28:00,108,"pinners take really good care of their pins, so it's not obvious you're buying second hand.  Buy better first time around.  I recommend Raven Vectra SST, the rod is more important IMO."
4363,jordan,2006-11-23 20:16:00,136,thanks for all the infomation. not sure which one i want but this is a start.   jordan
4379,charlied,2006-11-23 20:43:00,584,I bought an Okuma Sheffield....only cause it looks flashy....well thought that when I bought it.....and I am super happy with it.  At first it can be a pain....lost tons of fish when I first got it but the hook-up percentage can be way more than with a spinning reel....once you get the hang of it you can truly get tons of fish with it.  I payed $300 with line and backing for mine and have put that thing thru heck and back and it still keeps on going!
4423,jordan,2006-11-23 23:12:00,136,Okuma Sheffield that is the one i wanted it looks kool sweet thanks good to know that it is a good reel.   jordan
4428,charlied,2006-11-23 23:34:00,584,Glad I could be of some help!!!
11102,FishFinder,2006-12-12 01:39:00,481,"if you didnt get one yet, and dont mind buying used... http://www.thefishinguide.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=4541"
11137,luv2drift,2006-12-12 03:03:00,147,My first pin is an Okuma Adventa...really good value for the dollar.  But if you are willing to spend that much get the islander....and MAKE SURE you budget for a reallllllllllly good rod!  Learning to cast is a challenge and I swear the rod has a lot to do with it.   There are also alot of good used deals out there.  I personally would get a good used combo....Most of the combos are in near mint condition because pinners tend to take care of their gear!
11148,kemper,2006-12-12 03:18:00,2232,"Im looking into getting a pinner as well, and right now the okuma's are looking good because of the price."

11183,mikeh,2006-12-12 09:29:00,824,a store in Scarborough has the raven eclipse (blue one) on sale for $169 + tax. if I didn't already have a float reel I would have bought one of these.
11208,Disspatcher,2006-12-12 12:32:00,73,"I bought the Okuma last year, light reel and very reasonably priced. Save your 200 bucks towards a nice rod!"
11246,Uncle Buck,2006-12-12 14:18:00,1000,"I just picked up a raven Eclipse, i still have to figure on a rod... any ideas for a rod?  also for line, i've seen guys use colored line and others use plain ""white""  everyone says pinning is a rush!! Hopefully i'll experience it"
11273,Disspatcher,2006-12-12 15:34:00,73,A nice rod for the newcomer ...Fenwick HMX....not too expensive and will do the trick. Its no GLoomis but 1/2 the cash too
11318,Rich,2006-12-12 18:25:00,3927,I've been running an Okuma Aventa and Quantum Cold Water noodle rod this year. The whole combo ran me about 200 bucks and works really well.
11354,Disspatcher,2006-12-12 19:44:00,73,"Rich, is that you...  the ""ILL NEVER USE A PIN"" bass fisherman? WOW>>Been a big year for you Rich.  I knew you'd come to the darkside. Whats next, skydiving?"
