Just a rundown on what is available in Ontario, photos, contact info. etc. My question is this - are the Boga Scales (15, 30 or 65lb) available for purchase in Ontario, or are they only available online or from the States. If in Ontario, I will have to include them. Can't find any info online though. I have Bass Pro Shops, Berkley, Mustad, Rapala and X-Tools covered. Any others you guys can think of? You think you have them all covered, then one more comes out of the wood work..  Thanks for any help.. Justin"
