Just wondering?   Bill you in?"
10371,duber,2006-12-10 04:19:00,220,"Heh raysfish.I live by Northport and I try to keep a tab on the ice on the bay from Belleville to Desoronto.I will post reports on the ice conditions when we get some.Big bay off Big Island is usally the first ""safe"" ice.Some of the back bays have a skim on them now but the wind is keeping most spots open.  I may even be able to point you in the right direction when you decide to come down"
10731,fishindevil,2006-12-11 01:26:00,6254,"you can also check the bay of quinte fishing board,its not as good as ours but they all know the up to date conditions, i think its www.quintefishing.com...."
10735,MuskyBill,2006-12-11 01:31:00,311,"With you Ray, I'd ice fish in the Arctic.....  I read somewhere today that the ice season on the BoQ was going to be short at best, because of the high water conditions in the rivers running into it. I don't have a clue really, I just read it....but YES, I'd be in!!  Don't forget, you still have to show me how to catch a Whitey...."
