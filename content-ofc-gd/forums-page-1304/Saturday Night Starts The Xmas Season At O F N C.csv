Don't worry...if it is too festive or if you are named Ebenezer, you can switch back to the primary skin. Right after Christmas we will be displaying our newest skin.. The ""OFC Club' skin is a nice redesign of the Christmas skin. We will then release a skin every few months just to keep things interesting. Some of the skins we have purchased and/or will purchase include... A nice water themed skin, a very 'Lady Like' floral skin and a skin designed for fast load and minimal schmaltz.  This week brings the release of the newest version of the Invision Power Board of which this site is designed with. Our pre-opening Beta-testors got to try it out already and everyone had a blast with it. It has several huge changes which make the whole site run faster and far easier for the users. I would think we will target the second week of January for the upgrade....depends on when the skins will be upgraded. We'll then likely have some more toys and stuff for everyone to play with as well as new components."
