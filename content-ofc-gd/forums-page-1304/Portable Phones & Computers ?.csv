10285,lew,2006-12-10 00:29:00,12767,"I have a portable phone that's been  sitting beside my computer for the last few years, but I bought a new one yesterday and while reading the instruction booklet, I came across a message saying not to have a portable phone sitting near a computer.  Anyone know the reason why, and if it'll hurt the computer, how far away should it be ??"
10286,SlowPoke,2006-12-10 00:32:00,2984,it's to avoid interference on the cordless... have you base station on the other side of the room
10289,lew,2006-12-10 00:45:00,12767,"OK thanks Brian, I was afraid something would get damaged."
10378,pameladallaire,2006-12-10 04:58:00,470,I was having trouble and moved my base station into the bedroom.  Works fine now.  Pam
10414,verno,2006-12-10 12:15:00,178,"at the call centre where I work if someone is getting a text msg on their cell phone, everyone that is nearby can hear a bunch of beeping from their  computer as it comes in.  It's some weird kind of interference.  So if it happens you dont check your msgs for a few mins so no one knows it was you!"
10417,Handlebarz,2006-12-10 12:45:00,3790,well maybe that explains why I am getting so much interfearence in the last few days but then again the base has been by the puter for years now and its just starting to mess up a bunch I will try and move it.
10465,Fisheye,2006-12-10 15:13:00,15,"Morning Lew. I guess the    is over up our way! As to your question re: phones, my base is across the room but my handset is on the desk beside me. I have never had any problems with this. The only problem I have ever had is when my cel is on the desk. When it is going to ring, it just drives my computer crazy!   Static and all the good things that come with it!  P.S.-I guess I'll have wait till next year to meet you in person! The Poodle will be a lot bigger by then too!    Paul."
10679,setomonkey,2006-12-10 23:18:00,872,"Yup, interference.  We were getting lousy phone reception when we bought a new cordless phone set until I moved the base away from our wireless modem.  Mike"
10954,Headhunter,2006-12-11 18:27:00,5703,Other don'ts to remember; -don't store VCR tapes on your tv or near/on your speakers - you will lose info off the tape from the magnetic field created by the tv/speaker magnets -try not to drop VCR tapes... could also cause drop outs on the tape -don't store magnets near your computer/cell phone etc.. will definately mess up your stuff! HH
10969,pigeonfisher,2006-12-11 19:41:00,696,What is a VCR?
10974,douG,2006-12-11 19:59:00,2693,"SWMBO swore up and down that snakeskin wallets destroy the magnetic strips on her bank cards.  I am still trying to convince her that it is really the magnetic clasps on the wallet that does the deed.  That, or overuse."
10976,setomonkey,2006-12-11 20:01:00,872, LOL!  Mike  p.s. I think the V stands for vinyl or something. I remember the older guys talking about the new vinyl for some band they really liked...
10980,Headhunter,2006-12-11 20:21:00,5703,"Hey DouG... it's the ""Eel Skin"" wallet you have to watch your cards in! Pigeon... it's an ancient form of scrolls my mother in law still uses for her own personal entertainment!!! HH"
11007,lew,2006-12-11 21:45:00,12767," Yup, it woulda been nice to finally meet up with you too Paul, but the high winds really screwed up our fishing plans down your way this fall, but hopefully it'll be better next year.  We were down last month but the waves and very muddy water pretty much shut the fish down, then we planned on coming back 2 weeks ago, and the same thing happened, so we had to cancel our plans.  It was so nasty on the water, even the 2 guys gang trolling 8 baits couldn't snag a musky  So you boyz keep feeding the poodles and we'll be back down next year and give it another shot"
