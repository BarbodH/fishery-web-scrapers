When I  open the topic,  it will start to load, the top banner, then everything freezes, and I have to re-boot.  I cannot really pin-point which topics it will happen with, but I tried to send a PM to Rick, our resident guru, but there was also a freeze up.  I first noticed this when the skin was changed to the Christmas icons. I returned my settings to the original colours, but I still experience a freeze.  I don't know if others are experiencing this, but in all the years I've had this computer, I have not had as many freezes as I have in the past few days.  Thanks  John"

If you ever want to find out where a slowdown is, run a traceroute on www.dnsstuff.com This will tell you if it is the site that is slow or somewhere along the pipe."
