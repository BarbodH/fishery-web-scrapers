Fishin' Buddy, Hummingbird Pirana Max 10 portable,Lowance X45 dash mount. The digitals all work and I understand easily what is on the display. The flasher works, but unless you watch it consantly, you got no idea of whats under you. I'm just wondering which is best? CX    I'm hoping some of you diehard flasher guys can enlighten me!"

The flasher is extremely accurate and sensitive, but requires some getting used to in order to interpret signals indicating hard/soft bottoms.  It is possible to watch (so I'm told) a 1/32 oz jig dance in front of a perch's face when properly set up.  The LCD models are very user-friendly and much easier to read, and have a wider choice of cone angels.  An LCD is a better choice for a runner & gunner, who wants to see bottom contours and content while covering water.  Most people use and LCD in open water and a flasher on ice."
