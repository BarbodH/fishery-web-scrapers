11228,Clampet,2006-12-12 13:21:00,1947,They're still biting!  Great fish!!
11155,GbayGiant,2006-12-12 03:44:00,1780,"The only people who would know are people who have already fished the area anyway, plus all you have to do is go to a local bait shop to find out where people are fishing along with a million other ways to find a spot. I don't think a lazy background shot is going to effect fishermans secret holes.IMHO.  Nice fish though, you could try some WD-40 or the spray you use to get ice out of key holes on your rod to stop ice build up it works good."
11160,Jigger,2006-12-12 04:12:00,1237,"I think that theres a solution that would leave both sides satisfied. Take a picture with your fish, lets say you got it at Duffins. Photoshop it so that you get a backround from the Notty. That way you get a nice looking fish with some great natural scenery and not divulge even the smallest crumb of info on where you were at!The people reading the report can be ""satisfied"" that its a natural shot, and the guy/girl writing the report could laugh their guts out!   I wouldn't know how to do that, but I'm kind of surprised no-one has thought of it yet.   Cloak and Dagger Fishing"
11161,FishFinder,2006-12-12 04:14:00,481,"than the notty guys would be mad, lol"
11164,Jigger,2006-12-12 04:16:00,1237,"I suppose, but what are the chances you run into them when you're hammering fish down on Duffins?"
11225,ccmtcanada,2006-12-12 13:14:00,7971," I hear you Rick.  That's the thing for us....we fish at night....and shine a light on us.  That way the fish is lit up nicely and the background is non-existant.   As for daytime pics....if I were to ever post one, I'd do my best at the time to quickly take a pic and look at it when I get home.  If there's too much to give away, I'd either not post it or photoshop it."
10233,FishFinder,2006-12-09 21:53:00,481,"Went out today for some fishing and Lost a lot of fish (3lb leader) but landed a decent fresh one and some shakers (not really worthy of pics). was Very cold and the guides kept freezing up, not to mention the water was all slush. And since Thawing a roe bag in my mouth isnt my idea of fishing i ended up using artificials and flies the whole day.  I didnt even have to edit out the background this time"
10239,fishindevil,2006-12-09 22:13:00,6254,"those backgrounds look very interesting.but i would still prefer to see the natural backdrop....  and thats a real nice bow too,thanks for the report"
10248,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 22:34:00,933,"nice one, i would also like to see some natural background."
10251,FishFinder,2006-12-09 22:38:00,481,"did that once, found 3 guys fishing my favourite pool the next morning, never again..."
10252,Pigeontroller,2006-12-09 22:38:00,2793,"Is anyone else tired of seeing pictures like this? I understand the need to not show where you're fishing, but couldn't you take a pic that didn't give that away? I doubt anyone would recognize a background of trees!  I don't care care to see these make-believe backgrounds, or worse yet, all blacked out!"
10257,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 22:42:00,933," Ur not the only one, yeah a pic of trees and rocks in background wouldn't be too recognizable. Now if u take a pic with timmies in background that would be a problem"
10259,FishFinder,2006-12-09 22:50:00,481,"I leave the background and i get so many PM.s to remove it  I remove it and you complain that the background is not natural.  COME ON, next time should i just not post"
10260,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 22:53:00,933,"  Aint complaining, its constructive criticism.   , just dont take pics of any too recognizable spots. No more from me... lol."
10262,iceguy,2006-12-09 22:54:00,341,I like the background. Keep your spot your own. besides every one has seen trees and rocks how many of seen ice bergs and steelies together.Nice Fish.
10263,wishn4fishn,2006-12-09 22:59:00,108,"Wat difference does a backround make?? I get tired of not seeing enough reports of fish from people that never fish.  You can't please them all.  Keep the reports coming, Fishfinder."
10273,Jigger,2006-12-09 23:31:00,1237,"  I have to agree with Pigeontroller. The fact that you posted a report is great, but these rigged pics drive me nuts! If you can take the time to take a pic, take the time to take a pic with your back to the woods if you don't want people to see where you're fishing. The trees ALL look the same right now. Or, take a picture with NO trees and all water. The rivers are no secret, and if you saw three guys on a spot the next day after posting a pic, chances are they've been there before.  That being said, congrats on what sounds like a fine day. Nice looking steel."
10275,Paulus,2006-12-09 23:37:00,522,"I agree about not getting enough reports, but at the same time you can easily take pictures that don't reveal where you're fishing. For example.... Ok, so you don't know if I actually caught this fish, but the fish looks nice & so do the rocks, the water and the elastic band behind the reel.  "
10276,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 23:39:00,933,"yeah those r nice pics, but if i dont have a buddy with me or an automatic timer thingy ill take that pic. See i would rather hold the fish lol, its nicer memories i geuss..."

10279,ChrisK,2006-12-09 23:47:00,2772,Nice steelie FishFinder. Must of been a pain runnin your float between all those iceburgs  Cheers !!!
10281,urbanangler1990,2006-12-09 23:53:00,933,"  Huh   , lol who did? lol"
10283,shriek,2006-12-10 00:18:00,1,"lol Its his report he can do with it as he wishes, nice fish. No matter what you do there will always be criticism"
10300,jason27fish,2006-12-10 01:38:00,90,nice steely man
10323,Rich,2006-12-10 02:12:00,3927,"Nice one man! Educate me on the ways of the chrome, cuz I sure as heck dont seem to be learnin' anything!"

10361,Bojangles,2006-12-10 03:41:00,46,"Nice fish Aleks... don't let the others fool you as these years of steelheading have dramatically changed due to people revealing spots over the internet and everything. Keep photoshopping all you can!  See you soon,   Bojangles!"
10364,tip-up,2006-12-10 03:58:00,94,Nice!
10377,Greencoachdog,2006-12-10 04:58:00,8163,"Nice fish!  If you have the self timer you can set the camera low and have a backdrop of sky, and we've all fished there before... under the sky.  That is some good photoshop work though."
