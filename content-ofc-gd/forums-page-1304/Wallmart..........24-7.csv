11435,Clampet,2006-12-12 22:49:00,1947,Which store?
11444,Carp,2006-12-12 23:03:00,1488,Good for the shift workers who can't get out during regular business hours.  Does this affect all stores ?  Up to Christmas or beyond ?
11499,DanTheMan,2006-12-13 01:25:00,257,"Ok guys, dont freak out on me, but I think its Bull.  They dont need run stores 24/7.There's is plenty of time to shop during the day.Most stores our open 12 hrs a day now,why the 24/7?If you work retail, you will probly understand more where Im going with this.The plp that work in the stores have a life also.I hate these BIG compagnys just like Walmart that dont give a rats a@@ about anybody but themself. I work retail and as a manager I must say,and we are the same thing,well not quite as bad, but where getting there.This will be a second year opening boxing day, wich im my opinion sucks!! Last year, we where 10-5 on boxing day,and now this year 9-6.It wont be  long before where just open every day will be a regular day  And thats because of these big compagnys again.  Anyway, thats enough of me  GO HABS GO"

11564,Blake,2006-12-13 03:25:00,418,As far as I know its just for the week leading up to Xmas in our area.

11593,raysfish2005,2006-12-13 05:20:00,163,"It looks like from monday untill x-mas, you have to love them for trying...Sorry Dan, but think of the overtime and new parttime jobs !!!  there's no ice down here in the big smoke so i have to work more and play with the wife less, she's happy because when she hears me comming to bed now ,she will be able to jump up and say she forgot to buy some cucumber and off to wallmart she goes!!!"
11598,pameladallaire,2006-12-13 05:39:00,470,"I haven't heard anything here.  With the mine shift workers, the only stores that stays open 24/7 are Tim Horton and A&P and there are lineups at both at 3 a.m.  Just shows this town never stops, work that is. "
