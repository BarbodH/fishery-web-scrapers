11107,irishfield,2006-12-12 01:45:00,26272,Try switching to the old Driftwood skin....I found the Christmas one is slower. I have also noticed the site is slower today than it was say two days ago. Thought it was just our server bogged down..but...
11111,Corey,2006-12-12 01:56:00,355,Stop advertising on highways and church signs and pay for more bandwidth! Did everyone notice the white text above the OFC message on the church sign? Kinda cute... I have used warningsigngenerator to make some choice signs that get hung outside the bathroom...  cd.
11112,Kerry,2006-12-12 01:58:00,383,I just deleted it from my favorites and added it back on and now it's loading up like normal. Kerry
11118,Nanook,2006-12-12 02:13:00,565,"Rick; she is very resistant to change,and as the saying goes; I'd sooner argue with you, than her. LOL!!!"
11126,Nanook,2006-12-12 02:25:00,565,"Did the delete thingy Kerry.Switched back to Driftwood skin Rick.  Working fine once again. Thanks a lot guy's,appreciated.   Corey.........???????"
11192,aplumma,2006-12-12 11:42:00,6896,Funny it was that Rock and roll that ruined my Wife. She was fine with Opera...... Glad you are fixed  Art
11418,Corey,2006-12-12 22:07:00,355," It was kind of a joke... the ""Signs, Signs"" thread shows the results of some online sign generators that are on the internet... You type in some text and it makes a realistic looking picture of a sign with your text... I was making a little crack about buying some some more highway for the site, all tongue in cheek.  cd."
