From the Stepan side launch (west side)    From the airport side (east side)    Notice the ice (water level) is still high.Hope the levels drop during this thaw and let the ice set up at normal levels when it gets really cold.  BTW for those thinking about it ---STAY OFF--- it aint safe by a long shot.  Kerry

11167,iceguy,2006-12-12 04:20:00,341,To think  I fished there last december 13. Ice was 4-5 inches of clear black ice.Didn't get one bite that day despite the great weather we had.Thanks for the update.
