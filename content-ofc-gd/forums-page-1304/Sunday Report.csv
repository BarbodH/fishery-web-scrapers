Trapshooter had a breakoff at the end of the day and we also missed a couple. It was a great weekend to spend out on the hard water doing what i love best....FISHING Thanks for the fish today guys .

10800,huntervasili,2006-12-11 03:26:00,1604,At least you have ice
10806,TechnaGirl,2006-12-11 03:36:00,15,"good times, good times! Now you have 3 weeks to scout out the next honey hole before we'll see you again... Cheers!"
10812,Dondorfish,2006-12-11 04:00:00,1000,Nice report and nice pictures!   Sure wish we had ice - can't wait!   Don
10826,Joey,2006-12-11 04:29:00,9122,"I can't wait.  Thanks for the pic, and it was a great mild day out there for it.  Joey"
10903,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-11 15:39:00,2585,Lots of rain and warm weather coming up there this week.  Most likely the ice will be gone in a few days.  Lucky you got out there as early as you did!  Cheers!
11027,icewalker28,2006-12-11 22:49:00,39,We had really good black ice and the warm temps Sunday didn't affect it at all. The weather is going to be warm for a few days and i will defanitly be staying off until colder temps. It is nice to have a couple days under the belt though.... Let's all pray for the cold weather.
11037,DanTheMan,2006-12-11 23:12:00,257,"Ok, please correct me if Im wrong.Is it not good to have black ice? I though it was very dangerous to have black ice  .I'm no pro, but I usually go on when there atleast 2 feet"
11054,fishindevil,2006-12-11 23:54:00,6254,"way to go,and at least you got to go out ice fishing  we are all waiting for ice down here in the south...oh well it will be here ...sometime ???? maybe  nice report & pic thanks"
11074,Rizzo,2006-12-12 00:26:00,4754, black ice is bad for driving.  Good hard stuff for fishing in my opinion.  I love it when I can see down through the ice.  When you're bringing in fish they look huge!
11079,ShaunB,2006-12-12 00:33:00,73,"Wow...out already!!!  We are going to be waiting quite awhile around southern ontario.  Last year I remember being on Cooks Bay 3 times before new years.  I certainly can't wait to get out and my target fish for this year is walleye.  I can always seem to get them in the soft water season but never in the winter.  Well, lets hope that the warm snap doesn't break the ice up for you guys up there.  I think you are the first guy I have seen reportin ice fishing.  Congrats to you!"
