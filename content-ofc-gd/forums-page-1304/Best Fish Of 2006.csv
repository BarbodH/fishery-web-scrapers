10819,bpsbassman,2006-12-11 04:15:00,941,"Boy some beautiful fish here from the last year. Although I had some awesome fishing trips this year, I didn't catch any of the monster Bass and Musky that I dreamt about. One of my goals this year was to get into Salmon fishing on the great lakes and while only catching a few, this one was my first and PB.  Thanks to Steve from Hamilton for this memory. "
10823,Ron,2006-12-11 04:24:00,1683,"Man Roger, that smile is addicting!"
10835,Bly,2006-12-11 05:19:00,1556,"Wow!  Great pictures and fish!   I have two favorites for this year....  My first ever and longest walleye @ 33"" & 13lbs  and my heaviest walley....15lbs   blyght"

Carp - 34lbs    Chinook Salmon - 30lbs    Steelhead - ~15lbs (You will be able to watch me catch this beauty on T.V.! Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry January 7th, It will be on OLN)    Northern Pike caught jigging through the ice!    350lb Blue Marlin, just over 11 feet in length    I also had a 15"" Jumbo Perch but the picture is eluding me at the moment.

11221,motv8tr,2006-12-12 13:10:00,2587,Well I didn't get out to fish nearly as much as I would have liked this year but I did manage to get two firsts so it's all good

9957,Handlebarz,2006-12-09 00:33:00,3790,I would have to say this is my favorite from this year as it was just after I let dads first muskie slip outta the net before we got a pic of dad with it I knew he would get his first muskie this year and this pic sais it all.  
10000,Greencoachdog,2006-12-09 02:43:00,8163,A pretty nice Striper from early spring:  A couple nice Grouper:  A couple nice Red Snapper  The Blue Cat:  Flathead Cat #1:  Flathead #2 
10003,Daplumma,2006-12-09 02:47:00,1961,Thank you dwag for not posting pictures of your ass.I think I speak for most of us here. Joe
10006,ccmtcanada,2006-12-09 03:02:00,7971, LOL...good one daplumma!
10009,Ben_Daniels,2006-12-09 03:30:00,435,"Heres some bluefish me and my dad caught in Cape Cod, massachusetts.  "
10011,BrownTown,2006-12-09 03:45:00,103,"heres a couple from this year... First salmon of the year. While fishing off the pier around 2:30 am i managed to fall and pull some tendents in my leg, doesnt look like it by the way i am in the picture.  PB steelhead. first pic doesnt do the justice, the fish calculator put her at approximately 13lbs   nice smallie from my sudbury trip  stinky salmon  and last but not least, some dirtyyyyy undies!!!!!! wOOOHHOOOOOO "
10018,Spiel,2006-12-09 04:09:00,9065,"....Well I didn't really get out much this year but some of the highlights that made the year for me were fishing with IceguyD (as well as his wife and his buddy Bob) and Aaron Shirley. It was IceguyD (Don) who extended an invitation to Aaron and I to join him for a day on Simcoe ice. Suffice to say it was a great day.   Aaron wasted no time in tagging the first whitey of the day.   Don's buddy Bob also did well.   While I never did get a whitey I did manage a couple of nice lakers.   and Don who missed a few opportunities finally gets one.....  It was a great day!  Of course there were other great outings like the winter trip I took to Lakair with TEP to fish with TJ and Kevin as well as the G2G in June. I'm sure most have seen or read about those adventures.  But it was a trip in September I took with TEP to the Thunder Bay region that highlights my year. No trophies for me but some PB's were definitely caught. I'd been trying for a few years to accept an invitation from Dan and Sis to get my tail up there and thanks to some arm twisting from TEP, it finally happened. The inability of me to set a new personal best can't take anything away from the thrill of trip. Watching TEP catch his first brookie on the first evening was awesome.   Congrats Jef!  And again being there with Dan to net and photograph this beauty when he caught it are the thing dreams are made of for me.     You know I'll be back Dan and Sis, it's all your fault.  On this trip I aslo had the chance to fish Musky for my first tiem and while it didn't produce my first Musky, Jef was an absolute stellar and patient guide, but man is he addicted. we'll get 'em next year Buddy!   And thanks to all who have posted, I've enjoyed reading the posts and viewing the pictures. Boy there are some amazing pictures!"
10039,Ron,2006-12-09 05:21:00,1683,"Ya, I had a great year. I didn't break any Personal best but i still had a great year.  Did a lot of exploring on Lake Nipigon and took some chances too I guess. To get this Buck and the following Hen in the same day was worth it.     Pulling guys like this through the ice is by far the most enjoyable.    Mind you, tangling into double digits of Lakers on 6lb and ultra lights is a hoot too. WE musta caught over 40 Lakers that day.    Well I guess I did get a PB this year, my PB Kawartha Muskie.    And my first St. Clair Muskie, I really admire the colors of them from this lake.    I would rather tangle into these monster Drum more than I would the Trophy Walleyes.      Jumbo Perch makes for a ""Kid in a Candy Store"" kinda day too.    The best thing about tossing big lures? Catching BIG FISH!  "
10042,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-09 05:42:00,0,..Heres one that came out of my boat this year...

10174,danc,2006-12-09 18:42:00,4677,"Of course I'll never forget the look on Mahumbas face when he caught his best Brook Trout ever. A gorgeous 22"" male. It was nice to be able to share that moment with him.  "

10357,TechnaGirl,2006-12-10 03:34:00,15,maybe you measured it wrong!
10409,fishingguy28,2006-12-10 10:11:00,98,that one in the bottom pick would be called a bonita!!!  THey are really fun to catch!!!

10483,ehg,2006-12-10 15:47:00,2666,"Caught most species of freshwater sportfish in Ontario this year, no PB's however. This is probably the most interesting fish for me from this year.  Spat up by a 12 inch brook trout. First time in 30 years i've seen a Rainbow Darter. Sign of a healthy Lake Ontario trib.  ehg"
10597,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-10 19:56:00,2050,"Well I can't compare to most of you guys but I have a fun little story.  I moved to the GTA with the northerner mentality that there's no point in trying to fish ""the big city"".  Most of the people I met at work said ""fishing? in toronto? yeah, if you want to catch a fish with three eyes"".  Anyways, I met a SOLID DUDE at work, (fishnsled) who told me about OFC.  I checked it out, read some posts, got some tips from the great people of this board and WHAMO - before I knew it was having an awesome summer fishin' right here in Mississauga!  So to the newbies, you're in the right spot and to the Vet's of OFC - thanks and good luck in 2007!  the picture does it no justice but this smallie was a solid 17 incher   First of a species!! at least 7 or 8 lbs, I had never even seen a sheepshead before, and man I don't care what anybody says about them, they give up a heck of a fight!   There's no lack of monster carp in Port  Credit!!!     4lb eye   New species and PB salmon!   Cheers!"

I was lucky to get 2 new personel bests this year.  Muskie and Pike. Lets have a thread that blows away other fishing boards threads!  So here goes with some photos.  Pb Pike, never going to beat this one.    A new PB Geo Bay Muskie....finally one stayed on!!!    A nice 11.5lb quinte eye, not my personal best but still a good fish.
