I think it's likely the best effort yet, actually; and awesome issue. Hope you all think so and let us know.  (Here's something I think is over   ... the cold came in here in the night - ice time for good this time, I have a feeling.)  Hasn't arrived in Virginia yet either ... darn dogs.  For those waiting for it to hit newstand, it's Santa's   favorite gift (a subscription) for yourself and others, ya know.  Hey TJ ... both of your ads are in there buddy  ... we weren't   this time.  Pete"
