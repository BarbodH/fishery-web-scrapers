It's something I've been thinking of doing for some time and finally met with a recruiter yesterday.  There's so many options and they make it seem great, but just wondering what it's really like?  thanks"

11441,holdfast,2006-12-12 22:57:00,1813,"Ditto on what Minnow said.  I just retired after 25r's in the Req Service as a Combat Engineer.  Spent my last year posted to the Helicopter Squadron in Borden as the Ops Warrant and Mission Specialist..A well rounded Squadron of Reserves and Reqs.  It would not Run any other way.  I am happy and proud to say that the Reserves are blending well with the reg Forces.  many are assimilated in Reg Units on missions including Afghanistan.  My own experiences with some Reserves have been good when I was overseas.  Hard Workers, Loyal and trustworthy.  Of course they have to prove it during cross training.  They're Soldier Qualification and Leadership courses have come a long ways.  The only difference is the req Force Staff have to deal with more administration problems i.e kit, pay etc. Of course the Odd over-enthusiastic Reserve Staff member.  The reserve courses may be a little shorter.  The only problem I have with the Reserves is that maybe They're coddled too much in their home Units i.e ONLY IF THEY WANT TO! I have seen some Embarrassing so called Officers and NCOs that cannot fit in a Uniform and are FAT.  Wainwright always have problems trying to get reserve staff to help facilitate courses.  But the good thing thats really good with the Reserves is that if you really want too, you can do what a Reg Force Soldier does, Your not working for a boss that is buying his spoiled kid a fancy car or Toy, but the Loyalty of your Country that ultimately protects YOU and others?????.  Learn a Unique Trade, Look at things that your Average Joe doesn't because he is ignorant or cowardly.  Earn some money, AND ITS ALL PART TIME.  Oh, I forgot-If your a guy-You have to get a Haircut, No Jewelry in Uniform, and abide by the Queens Regulations and Orders.  Good Luck you will never regret it.  Only later on in life when your kicking yourself for not trying.  You can also PM me if you have any questions"
