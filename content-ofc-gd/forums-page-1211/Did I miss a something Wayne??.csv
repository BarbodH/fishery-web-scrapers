74904,irishfield,2007-05-25 03:00:00,26272,2nd piece of misery... of 10 days of hell... was my $600 canon digital camera going swimming in 30FOW last Tuesday (15th) Morning! The few pics I have are on a Kodak disposable. First time I haven't taken my Canon AE-1 to the lake for back up!
74908,Mike the Pike,2007-05-25 03:16:00,3421,Well Wayne after dropping one of my anologue camera's in the water falls in NorthBay another analogue camera lost in Cuba I decided to modify my current Camera to go around my neck in touchy wet situations.Sorry to here about your Canon and I know you liked that camera so much.  I am looking forward to the anologue Pics.Look on the bright side the Digitals are getting cheaper.  MTP  
74911,irishfield,2007-05-25 03:23:00,26272,"It was brand new Mike. Leah just gave it to me for Christmas. I had it in my coat pocket and it WAS snapped up. Leah said her seat was wet, in the steel boat, and I unsnapped my pocket, got a piece of shop towel out of it and off we headed for the marina. When I bent over to tie up the boat....kerplunk!!  Paid the local realestate guy, that scuba dives, $75  to retreive it. Unfortunately it turned itself on when the water got in...but pretty sure the memory card's still good...so still ahead of the diving bill anyhow. Will send it to Canon for repair estimate and in the mean time pick something else up to get by for now...for my landscape pictures."
74915,Greencoachdog,2007-05-25 03:28:00,8163,  Uh-oh!  Don't tell me you got sucked into the Bermuda Triangle with SlowPoke...
74917,irishfield,2007-05-25 03:29:00,26272,Damn close Glen and I meant to comment on Brian's thread that we'd better not boat together this year!
74934,Dondorfish,2007-05-25 03:57:00,1000,Sorry to hear about your camera Wayne - had to re- read your post - first time I thought you were talking about your new downriggers! Hopefully Canon can fix er' up for you good as new.   Don
75144,SlowPoke,2007-05-25 17:27:00,2984,"   LOL, good point. And I was going to ask you if you wanted to split a rental at Lakair."
