Buzz had never caught a Salmon before and it was on his, “too catch list”. We spent two days down in St.Catherines, where there is some fine spring fishing right now. The Monday of the long weekend was  Buzz’ first taste of Lake Ontario fishing.  Here are a couple pictures of Buzz from day 1   Sunset Monday evening   Day 2 was a great morning will less boats on the pond and a beautiful sunrise we thought the fish would be on. Sunrise Tuesday am   Buzz fighting a fish   Nice spring king   Another nice silver king   King coming in   Another king for buzz   The fishing was good we ended up 17 for 22 in less than 7hours and Buzz was loving every second of Lake Ontario Salmon fishing. We hit most fish on the riggers but the wire dipsys were also firing. All fish that we caught were released for another day.  Release Shot    Special thanks to John, at Tightlines fishing shop in Pickering for helping me get ready and   Okuma, A-tom-mik flies and dreamweaver.  Will be back at it again soon.
