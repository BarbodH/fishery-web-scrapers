74444,mattyk,2007-05-23 20:29:00,2110,"Well im getting ready for muskie season. I have heard how important it is to have all the proper release equipment. So i picked up a Frabill muskie net, some knipex cutters, some jaw spreaders, and a hook remover. Also got a few bucktails. Now i just need to make it up to Ontario.  "
74450,Rich Clemens,2007-05-23 20:40:00,3131,"Very cool stuff ... looks like part of my own equipment.   Frabil Net, Knipix ... it's geting about that time.  I'm really looking forward to the musky reports and pics."
74451,Raf,2007-05-23 20:40:00,3495,nice haul of stuff.  KY has a muskie population does it not?
74455,mattyk,2007-05-23 20:46:00,2110,Yeah we a few lakes with good muskie populations. The best are Cave Run Lake and Green River Lake. The only problem is my boat is up in Ontario.  I am planning on bringing it down one day.
74457,Raf,2007-05-23 21:01:00,3495,"i don't view that as a problem.  have fun getting those baits eaten, wherever you use them!"
74588,Joey,2007-05-24 03:51:00,9122,Nice equipment there bud.  I can't wait  Our ebay purchases of musky equipment this winter put us in the ebay gold member club  Joey
74643,Zib,2007-05-24 13:21:00,369,"Mattyk,  You should make a trip up to Lake St. Clair. The musky fishing is second to none."
74648,mattyk,2007-05-24 13:35:00,2110,Lake St. Clair is on my to do list. I hope to make it there one day. I saw a Bob Izumi show last week on Versus and he was on a charter fishing for muskies. Looked pretty good.
74661,tonyb,2007-05-24 14:24:00,1637,"Way to go! Very good to see you have the proper equipment for landing and releasing a Musky.  I picked up a great Musky rod/reel outfit last year and a small selection of lures, but haven't got a proper net or cradle yet so I have limited my musky outings (that and I don't have a boat yet )  Kudos to you for taking that into consideration in addition to the great lures you have selected.  Tony"
74679,Squid,2007-05-24 15:18:00,1656,Yep 8 more days to go. Can't wait!!! Going to St'Clair for the opener!!
