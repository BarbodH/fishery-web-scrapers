74848,Nater,2007-05-25 00:28:00,68,"  Ok so I purchased a Navionics gold= card a while back from cabelas...after reading on the internet it shows that the older monochrome units have 1.4.0 which is the software my unit has after looking at software info in the menu bar.  In order to run the Navionics Gold+ chip it says you need to upgrade through the website to get the 1.5.0 software.  So I bought the USB card reader, got a blank 128mb card from my camera...downloaded the file onto the chip.  put the chip in the slot on the gops and turn on the unit.  It says that the software will update itself when the chip is put into the SD card slot.When I select from the menu mmc card data it shows the update is there yet it isnt updating  well I have done the following and my software for some reason or another is failing to load...I turned off the unit threw the Navionics chip in and still no depth contours.  Please anyone who can help I need this thing runnign by the weekend and am at my wits end  Nate"
