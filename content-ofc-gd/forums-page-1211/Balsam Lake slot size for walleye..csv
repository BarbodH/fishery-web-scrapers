74698,Terry,2007-05-24 16:48:00,14456,"yeah but when it comes to  the MNR being close only counts if you have a large calibre gun pointed at them  I can see it now, but sir I was told by Victor.. I could keep anything over 21.5...no well what about smith and wesson, it says I can keep it too..thanks and have a nice day.......lol"
74707,Victor,2007-05-24 17:21:00,1609,o yeah you're right Terry ... i would double check the rules again if i do go to Balsam as i wasn't too sure about those numbers in my head ... and i have never really targeted walleye there
