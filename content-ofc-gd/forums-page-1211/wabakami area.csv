Has anyone ever fished this area? Any help would be appreciated. We're trying to talk them into flying us in the night before but if not, we thought about hanging around Thunder Bay the night before. Is there anything fun to do there? We considered the casino but not sure what Thunder Bay has to offer. Thanks for any help.  Postman"

We use jigs for 90% of our fishing tipped with worms. Yellow or white bodies with black jig heads is about all we carry working drops, shoals and in flows. It should do the trick for you. As for staying in TB its a big town and lots to do."

73413,postman,2007-05-20 19:55:00,12,"Hey guys,  Smokey, thanks for the info. I won't have any worms but I'll have salted minnows. TJSA, we're actually scheduled to be in TB on 5-31-07 at approximately 4PM. We're picking up one of our guys at the airport there. We actully won't know if we will spend time there or not depending on if we'll get to fly in the night before. They're suppose to let us know. I will reply when I get the details.  Thanks again,  postman"
73435,tjsa,2007-05-20 22:38:00,1578,"Let us know the details when you get them, maybe a meet and greet is in the works depending on schedules if it works out. I know DanC, Mahumba, Snowball, and I, and another new OFNCr up here(Ben?something, sorry cannot remember) would like to at least try to meet up with you given the chance, we just need advanced notice to make it work."
