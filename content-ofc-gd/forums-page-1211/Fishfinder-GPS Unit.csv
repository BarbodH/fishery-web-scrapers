74499,Stoty,2007-05-23 23:26:00,2910,"Ok, I think I have it narrowed down to 2 units.  Lowrance LMS-522C IGPS Sonar/GPS Chartplotter with Built-In GPS+WAAS Antenna ($649.99 US) or the EagleÂ® FishElite 640C or 642C Color Sonar/Chartplotter ($569.99 US)  How do these units compare? Is it worth it to spend the extra $100 and get the lowrance? Which unit uses the best software? How much is the software? Can I get Ontario Lake data on both units?  Any feedback is appreciated!"
74509,Roy,2007-05-23 23:43:00,13728,I'd go with the Lowrance unit. The Lowrance is a 2400 watt unit while the Eagle is 1500 watts. They both use the same software.
74607,hawg_hauler,2007-05-24 10:49:00,69,Stay away from the built-in antenna. Have heard nothing good about them.
74611,Blake,2007-05-24 11:22:00,418,The Lowrance is worth the extra $$.  It has a better power and also IMHO quicker detailing and reception.  The internal GPS is a great feature and I have heard good things about them.  The software capabilities should be the same but it may be easier to get updates on the Lowrance unit.  You must consider though if the unit need repair later on with the GPS reciever that you will lose the whole unit and be without a sonar as well.  Either way you will be happy with your choices.
74627,Stoty,2007-05-24 12:20:00,2910,"Ya, from what I have been reading, the Lowrance is the way to go.  Never thought about sending it away to get repairs done. That would suck to loose the whole unit for an extended period of time. Luckily I have a portable Eagle that I can hook up if necessary.  Thanks again for all the input!"
