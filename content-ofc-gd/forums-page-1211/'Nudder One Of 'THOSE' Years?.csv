74602,Photoz,2007-05-24 09:02:00,792,"The only place I've found up your way is in the Holland, where you can get access to the water or the Beaver. I fished out at the mouth of the Beaver, TWICE, all day, a couple years ago, saw lotsa carp in the river, laid out POUNDS of corn . . ..    they wouldn't touch it!! They tend to be very suspicious of anything they've never been introduced to . . . .    if a person had the time, and was close enough to a spot like that, and 'chummed' the area heavily for a few days, they'd get fish. I did this in one of the eastern tribs 3 years ago . . .     always saw LOTSA carp . . .     couldn't induce 'em to hit ANYTHING, on the advice of an English pal, I 'chummed' the area heavily for about 10 days . . . .   my next trip produced 7 fish, ALL over 20 pounds, with the best being over 30! I KNOW Simcoe is LOADED with carp, it's the UNavailability of legal parking, and shore access that keeps me away. Then, by mid June, it's weeded in so thick you need a winch to get your hook and line back in! But . . . .   ANY hints (P M) at fishable shore spots is highly appreciated!"

But I don't think you'll try them because there are a lot other things about the way you (and me) do this carping thing other than the catching part. Although, some catchings once in a while sure make it better.  Not much I can say (or I need to say), I enjoy all my outings, even those fishless trips. Nothing beats the laughs and talks on the bank, and when the buzzer goes off....  In my calculation, you will get into major number in a week."
74330,Photoz,2007-05-23 12:50:00,792,"Yeah h h h  h . . . . .    the more fished a spot is, the craftier the carp get . . . . .    they're still there, but are much more careful what they slurp up! Even my fave hole up in Peterpatch isn't producing much! Next week I'm off so I'll hit ALL the spots that aren't seeing much action."
74358,wolfville,2007-05-23 14:51:00,396,"Steve, a week off in late May is priceless... have you fished Peterborough lately? are you saying the fish are not feeding there yet?"
74375,The Urban Fisherman,2007-05-23 15:34:00,2050,"Hey Photoz,  I'm off next week to!  Let me know if you're going to be near Mississauga and maybe we can meet up for some carp action!  cheers, UF"
