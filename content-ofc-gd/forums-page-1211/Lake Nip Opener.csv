74502,Clampet,2007-05-23 23:31:00,1947,"The dogchain murder, as they referred to it occured around 1966 or so.  Just outside of Cache Bay, ON. It occured on what is now known as Levac Rd, past deadman's corner.  You hang a left.  (If you turn right the road goes to the main Hwy 17.)  As you come around the corner, it is the second house on yer left.  Follow that road and you wind up in Verner, ON.  A couple of brothers owned a pig farm, and were on the receiving end of a home (farm) invasion.  I can still recall the event being recalled by the one brother that survived. It was on the radio. His brother succumbed to his injuries a few days later.  The assaillents tied them up with dogchains and tortured, them in the hopes they would reveal where they kept their money.  My cousin, Det. John Racine worked the case for quite some time.  Apparently the Police beleived it was one of the neighbours, but an arrest was never made."

74507,tjsa,2007-05-23 23:40:00,1578," Sorry,    I don't see that, never was a conspiracy theorist, never will be. As for hauntings and ghosts, don't exist in my books. Its a structure, nothing more, nothing less. Something bad may have happened there, but it will not affect any future inhabitants as far as I am concerned. If they wanna dwell into it, so be it, I won't, cannot."
74516,mason05,2007-05-23 23:56:00,258,Oh TJSA you're no fun I was just hoping to have some fun and maybe get some of the younger OFC members spooked. You big meanie...LOL  Corn Nug

74541,Muskieman,2007-05-24 00:43:00,2472,RE: murder house.. I live here and it's true . the last brother died a few years ago and brought the secret to his grave and the case was never solved.. but they had a few leads  5 or so years ago. i have'nt heard anything since.
74544,Clampet,2007-05-24 00:50:00,1947,"Muskieman,  A mile away. Where were you?  About the Dogchain Murder, do U remember the family name?"
74548,Greencoachdog,2007-05-24 00:55:00,8163,Very nice pics!!!... mediocre report... reminiscent of a few Temagami reports posted by another well known suspect.
74551,Muskieman,2007-05-24 01:01:00,2472,i live in Sturgeon Falls about a block away from where you took those pics at the dam. they were fishin'for Silvers. i recognized the Cache Bay tower right off the bat. as for the family name . i'll find out and let you know. i think it's Lefevbre or Lafond. but  ill make sure  .
74555,Mike the Pike,2007-05-24 01:16:00,3421,Great shots Paul you really know how to use a camera.At least you didn't get a skunking.  MTP
74565,Clampet,2007-05-24 01:54:00,1947," I know it ain't Lefevbre, or Lafond. But let me know, I'm curious now."
