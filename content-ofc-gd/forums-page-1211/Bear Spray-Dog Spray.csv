74859,Greencoachdog,2007-05-25 01:22:00,8163, Yeah I did!... still funny and it's best to just let them fight it out.. there's people that pay good money to see something like that and you were trying to stop it!!!  i'd have pepper sprayed ya too!
74865,ch312,2007-05-25 01:39:00,1590, mmmhmmm...and you enjoy seeing some drunk girl get her face pounded?   to each his own i guess.
74910,Greencoachdog,2007-05-25 03:22:00,8163,"  Uh-huh... funny how you failed to mention the face pounding in your initial description of altercation, just a catfight with clothing removal... and THAT'S what I was commenting on."
74585,Northhunter,2007-05-24 03:31:00,214,"Most encounters don't result in anything, but it seems there's a couple every year that turn into hell for those involved. It's almost always a boar in a remote area. Predatory bears. The sow defending cubs is more of a grizzly thing.  I personally don't know about the spray, but don't play dead with a black bear. A higher percentage of black bear maulings result in death than grizzly encounters. If a black comes after you, fight to the death. Go for the nose/eyes. 90% of them high-tail it in the opposite direction once they figure out what you are. The ones that don't that aren't habituated to humans probably want to eat you, but they're more likely to back off if they think they'll get hurt in the process.  Don't play dead!"
74589,Fishnfiend,2007-05-24 04:00:00,357," Thanks for all of the tips, but I am quite familiar with how to avoid bears. I camp in bear country several times per year and am an avid hunter.  I have yet to see a bear while camping (knock on wood). I also know that I must fight a black bear if it comes down to it. Basically, I still want to know if anyone has used pepper spray before...?   Oh, and the story about being sprayed by the police, too.   As for the legality of carrying a gun, the WMU I am going to has cottontail rabbits in season until June 15th."
74599,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-24 07:12:00,2585,your shotgun locked up not loaded in your truck will not help you.  by the time you get her loaded up you will be done. i heard of a high pitched bear whistle or it may be a radio single?  that keeps bears away.  they use them to keep polar bears away from the milatary guys up in north pole.  i will ask my father in law about it this weekend.  he was stationed up in alert for a year or so and got to see lots of polar bears.  probally to expensive to sell but apparently it works great.
74639,Entropy,2007-05-24 13:06:00,747,"A side-arm would be best.  It's hard to get a carying permit for this though.  CH123, story?"
74665,Tacklebuster,2007-05-24 14:40:00,303,"I've tried it on a racoon in our backyard, and I was not impressed.  The racoon showed no reaction and didn't even leave.  It just sat on the fence and didn't move no matter how many times I sprayed it, so I gave up, and it eventually left.  I would leave the shotgun at home, CO's see you with that, your just asking for problems."
74793,ch312,2007-05-24 21:51:00,1590,"lol i guess il spill the beans...  my boss and i went to a work related christmas party this past christmas and towards the end of the night a couple chicks started getting rowdy with each other and then their boyfriends got involved. me and another guy ""escorted"" buddy out of the building by hiw ponytail   and when we went back in all hell broke loose. i was drunk but i figure 40 people or so were pushing each other around and around 10 tables got tipped over breaking alot of bottles, glasses, plates, etc.  the cops got called but in the mean time i was wrestling people off each other. i started to break up two chicks (dresses got removed, no undergarments  :clapping:   ) and when i stodd up i got a face full of pepper spray. apparently the cop thought i was attacking the girl i had ahold of trying to pull off the other one.  i wont go into the rest of it cuz i covered what you guys wanted to know but to sum it up...  a few people got sprayed and cuffed for fighting with cops host of the party had a very large bill got to see hot naked chicks brutal headache the next day  i was drunk but ill never forget that pain. think of it like pouring boiling water in your eyes and face. definatly not a pleasant thing. im not sure how much capacin is in police issued spray but its alot more than the stuff you can buy at any store in canada.  you can buy the strongest stuff in the states from alot of stores but its not allowed in canada..."
74818,Northhunter,2007-05-24 22:53:00,214," I figured as much, Fishnfiend. But a lot of people don't know this stuff and are misinformed when it comes to black bears.  From what I've read it doesn't appear this stuff is too effective. Troy Hurtubise (the bear suit guy) said he learned the hard way no bear spray will stop a bear if it's only 1%. Take it for what it's worth I guess. It could stop an attack (even if just temporarily), but I don't carry the stuff. I prefer to have something I can deliver blows with (a paddle would probably break bone), but I'm quite a bit younger than your dad."
74833,Greencoachdog,2007-05-25 00:04:00,8163,  LMAO!!!! That'll teach ya!!!!... BEHAVE!!!
74836,Greencoachdog,2007-05-25 00:10:00,8163,I was watching the Discovery channel about this and the best bear deterrent is a combination pepper sray/air horn device. It sprays the pepper and makes the loud air horn sound like the one used at sporting events... although I've not seen them on sale anywhere.  The air horn by itself will also work.
74856,ch312,2007-05-25 01:09:00,1590, ummm....did u even read my post and why i got sprayed?
