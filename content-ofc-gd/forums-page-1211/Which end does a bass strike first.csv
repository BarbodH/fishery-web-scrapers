74566,fliptheslop,2007-05-24 01:56:00,112,"I am going to be trying a new weedless setup for tube fishing bass this year,and I know a bass strikes a minnow from the head first,but Iwas wondering if the same holds true for a tube, or does it pick up a tube from the tentical side first, this will determine hook positioning."
74568,Clampet,2007-05-24 02:00:00,1947,"I beleive most strike the head, unless it's a worm or leech."
74580,charlied,2007-05-24 03:03:00,584,I have lost tons of fish with the hook in the tenticals...this year I am switching the hook to the other end.  Saw a show on it and they had less fish come off the hook!
74612,Blake,2007-05-24 11:25:00,418,Try both ways depending on conditions and species.  I find for smallie I leave the hook by the tenticles and largies on the head area.
74629,Steelcat,2007-05-24 12:21:00,191,I really think it depends on what kind of prey your tube is going to immitate.
74630,misfish,2007-05-24 12:29:00,29133,"I watched them attack the tube from behind(tentical /hook).  A spinner bait,I have watched them strike from the side, Very cool to watch."
74633,ishingchippy,2007-05-24 12:45:00,33,I fish for bass with tubes often.  I'm very interested in trying this setup as well.  Which part of the tube should the eye of the jig come out of??  Still pop it through then tie your line??  This citiot would love a diagram hahaha
74640,tonyb,2007-05-24 13:09:00,1637,"I think you guys are giving the bass too much credit in their accuracy of strikes.  Remember that bass feed by means of suction, so whatever is in front of their mouth, in any particular orientation is going to end up in their mouth that way (or the fish misses your bait altogether!)  The most important thing to consider about hooks is their sharpness! Always, always carry a quality hook sharpener (not those cheap stones) and regularly check and sharpen your hooks as necessary throughout the day.    You will catch more fish with sharp hooks.  Tony"
74641,PatrickGG,2007-05-24 13:14:00,562,"when small mouth bass fishing Most strikes I've seen was from the side ""on a tube"", when large mouth hit they hit hard lots of times they hit vertically straight up out the weeds."
74642,Zib,2007-05-24 13:16:00,369," Ya, what Tony said."
74658,OhioFisherman,2007-05-24 14:09:00,6623,"Same with Tony myself, just my guess that a bass could out run the prey a tube is supposed to imitate, if it wanted to. Don`t know how much time they spend planning their angle of attack, just guessing not much, it`s smaller than me, eat it.  Can`t recall ever having lost a fish cause the hook was stuck in the tenicles, a firm hookset with a decent hook should solve that."
