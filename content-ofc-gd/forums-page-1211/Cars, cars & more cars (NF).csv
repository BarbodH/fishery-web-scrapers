74586,Joey,2007-05-24 03:45:00,9122,"On our way down to Lake Ontario for a fish on Monday, we saw this beaut driving down the 407, an old Chevelle El Camino, thought it was pretty cool so I took a couple of pics as we drove up to and past it.      My old Lumina that my son was driving snapped the rear wheel bracket and you can physically move the tire while its parked.  No way were we gonna let him drive it after we saw that, so it was time for the boy to branch out on his own and get his own new vehicle instead of mom's hand me down.  So, Today my son got his first new car, its a Chevrolet/Pontiac G5 Pursuit.  He's thrilled to death (not about the payment or cost of insurance), and is just beaming with pride right now.        Then, while we were waiting for all the paperwork at the car dealers tonight, this rolled onto the lot, so I got the cell phone out and took a few pics for the car buffs on the board.  Sweet ride!!!  A Ferrari Testerrosa.          Hope you enjoy the pics, it was car week in the family I guess.  Joey"

Got to meet my new doctor, I waited like 10 months for the old one to leave the practice, we weren`t on the same page. New one seems ok, I don`t rush to the doctors for something to do.  I have been up there when the had the cars before though, they do have some great ones. Just not my thing anymore, LOL I gave up cars for fesh! A good car will pull a boat!"
