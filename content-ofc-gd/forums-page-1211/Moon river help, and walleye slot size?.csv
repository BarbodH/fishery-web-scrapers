74730,snag,2007-05-24 18:21:00,1932,We're heading out very early tomorrow morning.  We'll be hitting Arnolds Bay and heading east towards the falls.  Any info on the area would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
74732,Cast-Away,2007-05-24 18:26:00,790,"I was fishing at the mouth of the falls on the 5th and the Walleye were still spawning, so you might still find them in Arnolds Bay. Pink jigs work well with 3"" minnows this time of year. T  he slot is 16 to 22 inches. You can keep them under this size and one over 22 inches with a possession limit of 4 per person.  Good luck and post a report when you get back!"
74737,snag,2007-05-24 18:35:00,1932,"Thanks Castaway,  How deep should I go? Did your jigs have rattles too? Oh, and did you buy the minnows at the marina there?  Did you catch the one in your avatar there?"
74752,Cast-Away,2007-05-24 19:11:00,790,They should be in 10 to 15 feet of water.  I did not try rattles. We did not catch any Walleye that day but did have a follow up to the boat. We ended up going to a different spot and caught 3 pike in a short period of time. They ranged from 3 to 5 pounds.  The minnows were purchased at the bait store in Fesserton on Hwy 12 just off Hwy 400. The locals only sell worms.  The Walleye in my Avatar was caught and released at the basin in July a few years back. It was just over 7 pounds. My buddy had a 9 pounder the same day.
74753,snag,2007-05-24 19:30:00,1932,"Awesome,  Thanks again!  I hope I have enough luck for a worthy report"
74779,tjsa,2007-05-24 21:04:00,1578," Even if you do not have much success with the fish, post a report, with pictures, any pictures, your boat, your campsite, you out fishing, your buds out fishing, your meals, scenery, your lacerated forehead after tripping over the fire in a drunken stupor and going headlong into the bark of the spruce tree,   whatever, don't matter, we like pictures."
74781,OhioFisherman,2007-05-24 21:10:00,6623,LOL Ditto report! Wanted to go there!
74845,snag,2007-05-25 00:24:00,1932," HAHAHAHAHA,  You don't know me, yet, It's like you know everything about me!  I already warned my buds about my annoying habit of falling into fires.  I think fires are like women They're so warm and pretty. But you will probably get burned."
74855,urbanangler1990,2007-05-25 01:05:00,933,"  hahah how true,  the burn degree varies,  good luck out there!"
