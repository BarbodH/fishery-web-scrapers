74508,Dutch,2007-05-23 23:40:00,831,"Hello all.  A friend of mine just recently bought a trailer on Rice Lake and is now looking for a boat to do some fishing and take his 2 girls for a ride.  Looking for an aluminum or a bow-rider.  He is looking for something wide and stable, probably 14'+, with deep gunnels as his kids are young.  No real preference between tiller and console.  Needs a motor to match the boat, minimum 9.9 HP, but would prefer higher.  If anyone has any leads on a good quality used boat in the $8K range, please respond or send me a PM.  We have been checking out the trader, but it seems like he is always the one to call the day after it has been sold.  Thanks in advance."

Just put it in the water and go. We used it for about 3 months last year Sept - Nov and it ran great, no problems.  He is selling it because he just upgraded to a bigger boat. Not sure what he is asking, I think around $6200.    Send me a PM if you want his number."
