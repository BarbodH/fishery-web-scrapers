74505,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-23 23:33:00,835,Look in your manual for W. O.T.  wide open throttle. Probably around 4500
74506,Roy,2007-05-23 23:38:00,13728,You sure it's a 2L ?
74560,Fisherman,2007-05-24 01:41:00,7201,"Not 100% sure but they list a 3.0 Litre at 44-4800 rpm, and it's an inline 4.  Quite a few years back somone rplaced a Volvo Penta with one of Mercruiser series, I do believe it was a 2.2 ror 2.4 litre GM block."
