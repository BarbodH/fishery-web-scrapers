Or do I just let it sit in there till it cools?  Trial and error it seems!     Been keeping the temp in the middle zone on the gauge, which says ideal.  Thanks in advance if anyone has any advice.  Thanks Jen"

The little whitish blobs are just moisture that has to be evaporated.  Once it gets to the right ""doneness"", you can try brushing a wee bit of real maple syrup on it.  Looks tasty already."

74453,JFR,2007-05-23 20:43:00,498,"Jen  Those pieces of salmon are starting to look good.  If you have an instant read thermometer, check the internal temp at the biggest point.  Temp should be about 155-160degrees F.  The internal temp of your smoker should bee about 200-225 degrees F at the dome, and you can control this by opening and closing the bottom vents.  The top vent should be opened full all the time.  More air flow= hotter temps, less air flow=lower temps.  Once you are satisfied that your salmon is to your desired doneness, take from the smoker and refrigerate.  Once the salmon has cooled then you will be good to sample.  Tasting right off the smoker, the fish will be a little soft or mushy.  Here is a link that I have used when I was starting to smoke salmon  http://www.salmonuniversity.com/rs_htss01_index.html  If I can help any further, drop me a PM  Good luck  John"
