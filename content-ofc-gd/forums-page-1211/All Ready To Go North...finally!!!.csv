74701,Basskicker,2007-05-24 17:00:00,421,Well the time has finally arrived for my annual spring pike trip.  All packed and leaving in the morning for north of Cochrane for 9 days to catch some pics and pikes.  Hopefully have some big fish for Team #7.....  Does anyone know if the black flies and mosquitos are BAD up that way yet? Thanks  Jason
74702,Fishnfiend,2007-05-24 17:08:00,357,Looks like you are in for the same # of bites that I am in for north of Sudbury...  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/features/...53.htm?CAON0153
74706,ccmtcanada,2007-05-24 17:18:00,7971,"Hey...you didn't tell me that it was THIS weekend...jeez...I have to pack and get ready....hey wait...you didn't invite me did you??? LOL  Seriously though, I hope you have a great time and come back with a bunch of pics of a successful fishing trip! Here's hoping the bugs aren't too bad for you! Good luck!"
74750,The Urban Fisherman,2007-05-24 19:06:00,2050,I was up in sudbury last weekend and hit the water for a couple of hours - better bring a bug vest! haha  good luck with the pics and pikes!  UF
74763,bigbuck,2007-05-24 20:06:00,2449,Take a bath in Muskol and you should be golden. Good fishing!
74764,bowshep,2007-05-24 20:06:00,378,"9 days, you better gain 10 lbs because you will lose it in flesh, My Dad says the black flys are bigger than normal and that the mosquitos are hunting in packs  lol"
74771,Billy Bob,2007-05-24 20:39:00,5865,I will also be leaving in the morning for the West Arm. Is it true that you are not allowed to kill mosquitoes because they are Canada's national bird
74790,tjsa,2007-05-24 21:34:00,1578,"No, they are harvestable, but there are limits, you can only catch and possess 200,000 per day, none live, and you are not allowed to let their flesh spoil. But, no cleaning is required. So, sprinkle them on everything you cook up, much like pepper, lots of protein in a few thousand of them on your hamburgers and steaks.  Use a butterfly net to harvest them whole, hold it over the smoke from the fire to kill them, then funnel them into a used parmesan cheese shaker for garnishing your meals. Add them to your meals within 1 minute of  going from the frying pan to the plate, they cook really fast. Anything longer, and the proboscis can be really tough going down the throat, considering there is going to be a few hundred of them every bite.  Don't get too worked up about the daily and possession limit, the CO's are not likely to count every one of them."

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ BZZZ BZZZZZZBBBZZZZZZZ!!!  GOOD LUCK!"
74869,irishfield,2007-05-25 01:49:00,26272,"Black flies are FEAST'IVE !  and the Mosquitoes started last night in Temagami as well...... I swatted my eye glasses off into the lake, while fishing off the dock around 9:45pm...just to add to 10 days of hair pulling nonsense!"
74898,Mike the Pike,2007-05-25 02:36:00,3421,Thats what I like about Quinte you catch as many fish as the fisherman up north and on the May long weekend I did not see one Mosquito.No black flies not aaaaaaa bug.  Good Luck to you fishing for gators.Have a good 9 days.  Enjoy the Parmesan black flies on your pasta.Keep them away from the beer  MTP
