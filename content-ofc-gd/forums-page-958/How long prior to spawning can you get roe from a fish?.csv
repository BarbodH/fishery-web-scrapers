How long can you generally get roe from a fish before the spawning season? I don't normally keep fish so I've never inadvertently found out. I have always gotten my roe right in the middle of the season, but I'm going to be fishing steelhead soon and I was wondering how long I'd be stuck with flies and pink worms"

255136,troutologist,2008-10-03 20:22:00,951,"Wait, you can catch steelhead on spawn? This changes everything...      On a serious note eggs are in early development stages long before the spawning season. At this time of year the rainbows will have small, immature eggs on the skein. Similarly, I kept a walleye 2 weeks ago and it too had immature eggs....   Pink worms for life!!"
255150,jwl,2008-10-03 20:55:00,1056,guess that depends on how early you catch one to belly slit it  by now I am sure if you catch a boot that's been in the river for a while..she will have no problem spewing eggs all over when ya pull her out of the water
255153,bassjnkie,2008-10-03 21:03:00,1101,"I am really not a salmon/trout guy. I normally use flies and artifical baits under a float. I knew a guy years ago that got his roe from Primrose trout farm, something like $5 a jar cured. Why kill the fish for roe.  Just my 2c  Daniel"
255154,Canuck2fan,2008-10-03 21:04:00,1444,"On a serious note, you will find that most steelhead you catch now will have immature eggs.... Of course if you happen to get lucky and get a fall spawning steelhead you could just hit the egg jackpot in the next few weeks. I know five or six guys who were lucky enough to do that early November where I like to fish."
255177,dp3200,2008-10-03 22:30:00,31,Thanks everyone. I don't take keeping fish lightly and wanted to be sure it wasn't going to be a waste.
255193,tdotfisherman,2008-10-04 00:02:00,317,Somewhat of a related question.. where can you get the best deal on mesh to tie roe bags? good quality stuff?
255221,Canuck2fan,2008-10-04 00:43:00,1444," I am sad to say that I have yet to find a ""deal"" on mesh my friend.... The dollar store doesn't carry it yet. LOL. However I have found a mesh that I like and it is a little bigger, softer and stronger than the other brands I have tried. The brand is Atlas spawn net. I gave a pal who owns a bait store some and he begged me to pick him up so more because he said it was the best he had used.... Considering I have seen him sell upwards of 500 or 600 hundred tied roe bags in a busy morning so him saying it is the best is a pretty good endorsement too."
255250,tonka-toy,2008-10-04 01:15:00,139,"Ladies scarf works best for me .comes in 2x2 sheets and is available at tightline and,yes most dollar stores."
255281,maybe,2008-10-04 02:14:00,307,"FWIW, Fabricland's current sale has craft netting on for $1.22 per meter.  This stuff's sold by length (in meters), and the netting is 180cm wide.  Might be worth taking a wander in there and just looking around.  The staff will definitely know what'll hold a hook (or pins), what won't, and what'll unravel if you look at it."
