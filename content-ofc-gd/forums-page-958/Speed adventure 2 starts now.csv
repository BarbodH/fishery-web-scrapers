BUT  I actually just didnt catch anything, anyone else smell that SKUNK!  So much different than last time, couldnt even entice a hammerhandle, and they hit all the time.  Did lose one decent smallie (2lb) and had a couple more playin with my tube. It was the only thing I could entice a bite on and they were just barely picking it up, I was watching me line and it would twitch, slowly slide to the side and then at the slightest bit of tension they would drop it."
