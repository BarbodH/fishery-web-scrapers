My nephew and I went out for 2 1/2 hours yesterday and worked the shoreline, and trolled the mid-channel. We marked all kinds of fish at 15' and lower, but no hookups. One of the funnier things was when my nephew pointed out to me that we were trolling stationary, as the motor was running, water was going by, but the shore was the same spot for 10 minutes or so. What a current! We pulled minnow baits, spoons, and bucktails, what should we have used? Thanks for any advice."

255377,greyhawk,2008-10-04 15:29:00,33,One of the best baits that my son and I use on the lower is a jigging spoon (silver - ctton cordells) We are extremely fortunate to catch a variety of species using a simple jigging technique in 15 to 30 feet of water.
255404,bassfighter,2008-10-04 18:56:00,366,"-How fast was the current where you were fishing on compared to what you see on Queenston launch?  How deep were you fishing in general?  Were you fishing US side or the Canadian Side?  How strong was the wind? Pick a day when the wind is within 15km or less for easier control of our lures. Not easy to fish the river when it gets too windy, and we still have the current to consider.  Fish close to the water grass/weedlines or search for some rocky bottom, try to locate the bait fish if you can,  find a spot where it has slower than average current. Fish it like you were fishing on any other river.  Technique: Cast upstream, let your lure (grubs or spoon or crank bait or spinners) drop down close to the bottom before retreiving, and do it at the slowest possible speed occasionally stopping without getting snagged, at times let it drift but constant tightlines. Remember, the current is already pushing your lure at a certain speed, you do not want to speed it up further or fish will be too lazy in chasing after it. You can also troll with  a spoon or tubes by casting it at the back of the boat and let the boat drift. Fish has tons of food source at niagara, they don't always bite too hard, even if they are monster size. Give them time to spot your lure to go after it.  Fish under 12-15 feet of water if you can. Locate the drop off close to shore lines. Large mouth seemed to like calmer and shallower water during fall, while small mouth likes some mid current.  You need more weight on your lure when fishing niagara compared to fishing other lakes, the added weight will ensure the lure reaches proper depth to cover proper area. Use 1/2 to 3/4 to 1 oz jig heads on 3-4-5"" white or black grubs. Small and heavy Spoon, tubes, spinners and crank bait works as well. Buzzbait works on water under 8 feet. Add split shots one your line 1 foot before the lure for added weight.  Use 6-8 lb mono or add flourocarbon leader on your braid. Used Lighter weight rod if possible, understanding the river current condition will help us adjust to control the depth of the lure, eventually landing more fish.  Anchor down if possible when the current is not too strong(do not anchor down on heavy current, it can be dangerous), work at it for at least 1/2 hour to let the fish come to you. Don't stay too focus on fish marking on your Sonar, it can be deceiving at times. I always tell people, find the fish motel(weedlines or rocky bottom, shoal) and the Fish Restaurant(bait fish), just hang in there and let them come to you.  Stop changing from one lure after another, we looses our touch/feel after a while and get frustated. Most lures works at Niagara, we just have to learn to let our lure get to the desired depth and slow enough to entice the fish. If you stick to one or two lures during close to initial boat launch, and get to understand the feel and control , you will nail them in a matter of time. Fishing success is at least 40% mental.  The trout or pike or musky will also take grubs and spoon.  Niagara river has amazing fishing right now, you just need to apply proper river fishing technique.  Joshua"
255437,fishindevil,2008-10-04 22:19:00,6254,Awesome fishing info josh !!!!.  ..its great to know for all the people who like me are planning on going someday!!!...cheers
255455,HTHM,2008-10-04 23:33:00,4082,"I can't seem to get a quote reply goin... *How fast was the current where you were fishing on compared to what you see on Queenston launch? * The current was around 5 mph, less than at the approach to the launch from downstream.  *How deep were you fishing in general? * I was in 25 - 30 FOW on the shore run, and 45 - 60 FOW on the troll back to the launch.  *Were you fishing US side or the Canadian Side? * I was on the Canadian side and will stay there as I do not have a NYS permit.  *How strong was the wind? Paick a day when the wind is within 15km or less for easier control of our lures. Not easy to fish the river when it gets too windy, we have the wind and current to consider. * The wind was moderate, over 15 kmh though.  Thank you for all the info you have given us, it has been very helpful!"
255456,Streamerguy,2008-10-04 23:34:00,121," Great info joshua,you forgot STREAMERS /roe sacs/skein and live minnows work very well!!!  and for spoons .....Musky's do hitem, picked up my 1st PB outta the river last friday(pics coming soon with report)   The rapids above the Falls reach a maximum speed of 40 km/hr or 25 mph.  The fastest speeds occur at the Falls:  68 mph has been recorded at Niagara Falls.  The water through the Whirlpool Rapids below the falls reaches 48 km/hr or 30 mph, and at Devilâ€™s Hole Rapids 36km/hr.   Tell you the truth, it's really slow atm @ Queenston.....but Streamers /roe sacs/skein/yarn and live minnows work very well down here when they start hitting,just stay on the bottom.  Queenston and Port Dalhousie are bottom bouncing fanatics!! while the whirlpool is more float fishing.  Hope this helps for your next trip down to the niagara river.   cheers Streamerguy"
255501,jwl,2008-10-05 02:21:00,1056,"best presentation on the lower is drift a 3-way rig......use your electric motor to keep the bow of the boat pointed straight toward shore and drift the exact same speed as the current...watch the stuff floating around on top of the water and try to keep that same speed, it's alot of work on the electrics but it ensures you get a good natural presentation..you want to try to keep your line as verticle to the boat as you can and keep your sinker in constant contact with the bottom, if you line is on too much of an angle from the boat you will get tonnes of snags.  Also, keep in mind if trolling, if you are trolling through the main drifts you are going to get a bunch of boats Po'ed at you..it scares the fish out of the drifts and scatters them around from running the gas motor....also when starting the drift over again, we always make sure to make a huge wide cirlce around the drift.  You will see this technique is the A! boat technique for the lower Niagara..try it out...if you see guys catching the fish, pretty much guaranteed that's what they are doing..we put a couple hundred steelies in the boat last winter no probs"
