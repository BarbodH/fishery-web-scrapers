Cliff....
255372,BillM,2008-10-04 14:41:00,17367,"How would you fish those?  Under a float?  (Trying to get into steelhead this fall, complete newb as far as steelhead are concerned  )"
255373,cplummer,2008-10-04 14:56:00,165,Bill.. The first pictures (bead heads)  are used under a float... The second 2 pictures are used both floating AND drifting and the third picture is used for drifting as you would a roe bag.. Cliff..
255374,BillM,2008-10-04 14:59:00,17367,"Thanks for the info Cliff!  :EDIT:  Would you recommend a noodle rod + spinning setup vs a float rod/reel for a newbie?  I am trying to pick up a 7wt flyrod for steel this fall/winter as my 4wt probably won't cut it, but don't wanna drop big $$$ on a float setup if I don't have to."
255381,kemper,2008-10-04 15:36:00,2232,"Looks like we have the same style..  I tied these ones       The bottom one is my best pattern out east, I have days where nothing else hits the water.  Also I tie them BIG compared to other jigs like the riverwood.   Yours look wicked, definatly detailed and dialed in.  Mine are kinda rough, but the trout dont seem to care!"
255412,Streamerguy,2008-10-04 19:39:00,121,"  Tie your line to a good barrel swivel w/clip,add 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce weight to clip(have to change with the current and found this to be the simplest and fastest way) and 3 to 4' leader line off the same barrel swivel (2 knots only instead of a 3 way)  add 1 of these with a corky and stay on bottom .........thanx for pic cliff!!    cheers Streamerguy"
