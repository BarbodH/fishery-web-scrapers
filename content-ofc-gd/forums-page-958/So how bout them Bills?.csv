254221,chickenhawk,2008-10-01 03:29:00,612,Anybody been following the NFL lately? Couple really good games this past week....its been real enjoyable to watch.......especially those Bills....wow playin some good football thats for sure! Think they have a good shot this year?
254235,holdfast,2008-10-01 05:49:00,1813,Dont know? Do you the Saskatchewan has a good chance?
254249,blaque,2008-10-01 11:07:00,2419,"Not much attention to this thread lol, but Ill Bite chickenhawk hehe. The only guy on here from Buffalo lol. Actually me and one other i guy i think.  Yeah, their record definitely shines so far.  But us Buffalo fans are not getting overly optimistic just yet. They've beat a few soft teams, and have another one coming in Arizona next week. So not the toughest schedule so far. Dont get me wrong, they've looked very strong at times, but at others.......have looked like a monkey humpin a football. Nonetheless they've found ways to win when they almost shouldnt have, pulled out some last minute comebacks and some second half comebacks..........which shows alot of character. Its all very poisitive, but still think we need a real test, or a few real tests back to back to really find out what they are made of. 4-0 feels good though no matter how ya slice it!"
254254,NAC,2008-10-01 11:53:00,369," With the cushiest schedule in the league this year, they should be able to do something.  They are playing a real nice game these days, but I'm not in the belief that they'll beat a Tennessee, Baltimore or San Diego(defence).  The Raiders gave them all they could handle and look where they're sitting now."
254259,Greencoachdog,2008-10-01 12:07:00,8163,"I like the college ball, #8 Bama's upset against #3 Jawja last weekend tickled the whizz outta me!!!  Is it true that the Big 10 has never won a bowl game against the SEC?"

254284,Greencoachdog,2008-10-01 13:14:00,8163, Ok!... thanks!... I must've meant Ohio State!
254314,canadadude,2008-10-01 14:30:00,769,"I think Trent Edwards is going to be the the next Tom Brady. The kid shows some great potential, he's got a good arm, is accurate and best of all a smart QB. He does show signs of still being young but when this dude gets in his rythm he is fantistic"
254317,Mike Pike,2008-10-01 14:51:00,1332,LET'S GO BILLS!  BUH BUH BUH BUH BUH BUH BILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WGR listeners will get this...lol
254318,tipupesox,2008-10-01 15:02:00,167,"Actually I beleive I have read that the Patriots have the softest schedule in the league this season.  Being a home town fan, the Bills do show some promise.  Hard to jump right on the band wagon, but I am enjoying what I have seen so far this year.  I would like to see the offense start a little stronger, it has been tough the past few weeks watching the games being determined in the later stages.  The Bills make me want to shout ................"
254320,Bitsmith2k,2008-10-01 15:11:00,396," thanks, that song will be going through my head for the rest of the day..  i'm not saying nothing yet to 'jinx' them.. for now i'll just sit back and enjoy finally seeing them win on a regular basis again.."
254343,Wendel,2008-10-01 16:40:00,213,I've been a bills fan for as long as I can remember. Best team they have had in a long long time! I'll leave it at that lol
254346,ffej,2008-10-01 16:44:00,14,"The main thing I like about the bills is this.  Without actually looking at the official rankings for top defence, offence etc,  it seems the Bills are playing very well on all fronts.  I dont think they are top 3 in any one category, but their offence, defence and special teams are all very good, making them seem, at this point, as a very strong team.  Yes, they should not have struggled against poor teams like Oakland and St Louis, but they are playing like a very mature team.  When it counts, the defence got the big stops, and Edwards has shown he can bring the team back from a late game defecit."
254347,danbouck,2008-10-01 16:46:00,4380,"Let's Go Buffalo!  Going to see them against the Jets and New England this year, can't wait!"
254352,troutologist,2008-10-01 17:25:00,951,The secondary will have to play better when they face better teams.  This is the best start in a long time. Hope to see them in a few postseason games this year.  McGee is about the most fun to watch return kicks in the league.
254362,chickenhawk,2008-10-01 17:53:00,612,Giants are looking good as well
254443,Billy Bob,2008-10-01 22:12:00,5865," Do you play football up there ? ? ? What's the name of the team and league  Now about the BUFFALO BILLS, yes they are looking much better than the last 5 years or so.  BUT they need to work on two key areas, RUN the ball and STOP THE RUN. I am not convinced they can do that consistently enough to win the big games needed to advance deep into the playoff if they even make the playoffs.  The Bill's defensive line is small in comparison to other NFL teams. Their defense ends have brilliant moments but nowhere enough to stop a great running team.  The ""Hit and Run"" running back doesn't look as good as last year. He now is studder stepping at the line of scrimmage and his legs don't keep going unlike when he was a rookie.  When they drafted Trent Edwards I knew he would overtake Lostman at the QB position.  We still need a TOP receiver like Andre Reed was. Evans shows signs of greatness sometimes but mostly just above average play most times.  Go Bills and take the Sabres with you"

254481,misfish,2008-10-02 00:11:00,29133,"For the first time in a few years,Im looing forward to watching and cheering the Bills on as a winning team. Just hope thier nothing like the Kyle busch burn out.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
254490,bucktail,2008-10-02 01:02:00,1857,"Have season tickets this year, guess I picked the right year. Dreading when they play some good teams but with there schedule there shouldnt be a way they can miss the playoffs."
254506,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 02:04:00,612,yeah i'd say you picked the right year
255172,napjohn8,2008-10-03 22:10:00,46,"honestly the bills haven't beaten any big contenders. They beat seattle who had no WR's, they beat the rams who are brutal, they beat oakland who are garbage too, There going to lose there next 2. Going to finish off 10-6, first round playoff exit."
