Leaving in Toronto and Canada for last 14 years, this forum was a great help to me in past and hopefully will be in the future as well. Back to my question. I booked cottage on a Lake of Bays for Thanksgiving weekend and looking for any tips as to what kind of fish there is, best techniques to use for this time of the year and any other useful info. I would like to make this memorable for my two boys aged 8 & 10 who are into fishing big time! In any case I know just spending time with them (OK and my wife) and enjoying great colors of Muskoka will be a something I’ll remember for years to come…"
254658,John,2008-10-02 14:57:00,2956,Welcome aboard.  LOB's is primarily a smallie and laker fishery. Rumour that there is a small northern population in the Oxtongue River area but I have never seen them.  Where on LOB's will you be?
254659,Bly,2008-10-02 14:57:00,1556,"Welcome Crush.   Wish I had some info to pass along, hope you have a great trip and that another member or two are able to help you out, always great putting the kids on some fish.  Curious about the name choice.....One of my all time fav OMD albums..."
254669,CrushBg,2008-10-02 15:14:00,3,"Bly, well definately my favorite OMD song  John, location is Dorset, eastern end of LOB.  Thanks!"
254857,wallacio,2008-10-03 00:36:00,475,"As stated, LOB is a Smallie/Laker waterbody (there are Pike around, but not in significant numbers to warrant targetting them)   You are going at a great time of year as the big Smallies can be found in shallower water, putting on the feedbag before winter.   Think minnow patterns around rocky humps and breaks.    A sonar and a hydrographic map would be a big help to find some likely spots.  If you want to increase the chances of having a good fishing experience with your boys, you may want to hire a charter:  http://www.lobfishingcharters.com/  Good luck!"
254919,Cudz,2008-10-03 03:02:00,2652,If you have a fishfinder try fishing for smallmouth.  In the past the smallies have been on ledges where water goes from 5-15ft.  that is is the summer.  Near thanksgiving the fish will probably be in a variety of depths but look for fish in the 20-25ft range.  There will still be fish in 15ft as well but most might be off by then but you never know.  Some fish might still be shallow.  I would probably drag tubes.  You should also give dropshotting a try there. Good luck
