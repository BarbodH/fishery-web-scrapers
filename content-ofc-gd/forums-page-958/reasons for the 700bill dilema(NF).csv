254368,danbo,2008-10-01 18:21:00,2646,Maybe we all will be eating fish soon..
254380,blaque,2008-10-01 18:59:00,2419,"Ill give it an honest effort when i have more time, but i cant listen to this pen shaker for too long. Why does he always have a pen in his hand, and never writing anything lol. Michael Moore should be burning the midnight oil making a documentary on this all as we speak. That should be more entertaining lol"

254459,Fisherman,2008-10-01 23:07:00,7201,Interesting to say the least.  If you don't have the money or means of paying off debts in short order then you shouldn't make debts.

254622,dp3200,2008-10-02 13:48:00,31,There is something seriously wrong with a system where the people are punished are those who actually save their money and live within their means... creating $700 billion = inflation = decrease in the value of your savings...  I'm having second thoughts about spending my savings on a new boat
254680,bucktail,2008-10-02 15:42:00,1857,I thought that the savings and loans fiasco in the early nineties put in regulations to stop some of this stuff. How can they be going through this all over again?
254723,bigugli,2008-10-02 16:51:00,6138,"  BIG  LOOPHOLES.  Most financial regs look great up front, but read the fine print. You could run a battleship through some of the holes.   Oops. Somebody apparently did."
254940,OhioFisherman,2008-10-03 04:05:00,6623,Actually some regulations were removed completely.
