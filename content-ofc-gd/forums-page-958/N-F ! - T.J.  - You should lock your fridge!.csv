253208,kickingfrog,2008-09-28 14:11:00,8333,"Flight school ...$20000 Flight hours to get pilots license... $15000 Owning and flying your own float plane... $180000  Landing on a remote lake and ""borrowing"" a 75 cent beer from a root admin and then posting the photo on the board... PRICELESS!!!       Disclaimer: All figures (including the beer) are completely made-up and may not reflect true market value."

253612,Roy,2008-09-29 16:50:00,13728,"I agree, that's way past priceless! I might be seeing the vagrant and his sidekick tomorrow.....my beer is safe though cause he'll be arriving in a land vehicle and won't be able to sneak in."
