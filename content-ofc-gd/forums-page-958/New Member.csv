254939,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-03 04:03:00,10439,"Hi!!!! New to this board. I grew up fishing in Southern and Central Ontario and moved 3 years ago to the NWT because I got tired of the congestion in Southern Ontario. My favorite species are trout and salmon but won't turn up my nose at 40""+ pike I spent most of my time growing up chasing steelhead, but now I chase Lakers mostly. I still chase bows on my yearly vacations to Alaska. "
