I am lucky enough to be able to finally get out and fish there after being in B.C. for the last 15 years. It will be so nice to land some of those golden monsters. I think things have changed a bit since I was there last, so I may need some tips and advice...  Have any of you had any luck yet this month? Please reply and post up some pics. I will post my pics and let you know how we did as soon as I am finished mounting the monster I am gonna hook... Cheers, Mahs Fett"
