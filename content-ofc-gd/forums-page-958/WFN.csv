254549,highdrifter,2008-10-02 04:12:00,2534,"YYARRRR..  I dinstincly remember getting a channel where they showed exerts from WFN shows years past, but it was for advertising purposes..  I whatched the same shows for a year!  HAHAAH!! HD"
254560,sharper,2008-10-02 06:01:00,279,I catch lots of reruns as well. Here's a link to a bunch of different outdoor shows http://myoutdoortv.com/new/fishing.htmls
254585,BillM,2008-10-02 12:07:00,17367,"Any see the recent show Cronzy did?  I was killing myself when he says 'I know the muskie guys won't like this, but muskie taste great!'"
254596,ecmilley,2008-10-02 12:47:00,2163,"I watch it on a regular basis, but all I really enjoy is extreme angler, next bite, izumi and those crazy's in the tarpon series, on a side note i really want some hercules hooks and shamwows"
254610,Cudz,2008-10-02 13:21:00,2652,Yeah I saw it.  He wrapped the fish in bacon and put it on the bbq.  He then says he is on a diet and can only have a few.  I am pretty sure he ate the whole plate of fish along with all the salmon and trout in Georgian Bay.
254618,Mike Pike,2008-10-02 13:36:00,1332,"I just wish Cogeco in Hamilton would dang' carry it!!!!!  ( Then I'd probably complain that they replay too many shows, but hey.. at least I'd have it! )  Dang!!"
254705,GBW,2008-10-02 16:21:00,8460,"LOL, Hi, Billy Maze here... Stop yelling Billy, we hear ya!"
254706,Reef Runner,2008-10-02 16:25:00,980, LOL. And the camera crew were never to be found.....
254848,Radnine,2008-10-03 00:14:00,1538,"I only get the shows on Global on Saturday mornings, and they are all re-runs."
254921,Cudz,2008-10-03 03:05:00,2652,I want that silicone edger thing.  I don't think I will ever silicone anything but if I do I could have a perfect finish every time (no matter what size i choose)
254922,PatrickGG,2008-10-03 03:08:00,562, LMAO! How about the Linedancer and Zorbeez?
254963,SlowPoke,2008-10-03 11:03:00,2984," ""ONE OF THE FASTEST AND EASIEST WAYS TO HANG JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, WITHOUT ANY TOLLS"" (it's tools!)  I agree with the rerun cycle.. I'll watch WFN before I go to bed, wake up, turn on the tube and it picks up right where I left off. As if I've paused the show.  -Brian"
