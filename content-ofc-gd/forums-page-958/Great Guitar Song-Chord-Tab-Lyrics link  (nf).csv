254467,Moosebunk,2008-10-01 23:30:00,3970," Nahhh just messing.  I played in a highschool band awhile with the guitarist/singer in this up and coming band.  James here was the most talented and has been producing some albums now.  If ya see them performing anywhere in Ontario be sure to go in and check 'em out.  They're out on tour opening with Matthew Good right now, but you can sometimes find them opening for the Hip, or just out there playing for themselves.   http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=tzAGTQpriL4  Good solo in this vid."
