255117,bassfighter,2008-10-03 19:23:00,366,"Any idea where to buy good deal 2 cycle oil in the Toronto area?   Are Canadian tire or Walmart brand as good as Evinrude, or Pennzoil or Valvoline brand?  How much are you guys paying for a quart or gallon?  I ponder on this site in the US.  and they seemed to have decent price, almost US$3 per quart, however shipping might be a killer."
255118,PERCHER,2008-10-03 19:27:00,787,On a newer engine I would stick with the manufactures brand.But if its a really older motor use a good quality oil like Valvoline or even Petro Can.I paid $118.00 for 10l of Merc Optimax injector oil. Dan
255121,Billy Bob,2008-10-03 19:37:00,5865,I have been using Walmart's SuperTech 2 cycle oil for almost 15 years now.  No problems and seems like the same as Johnson's 2 cycle oil that cost twice as much. It probably is the same stuff.
255130,Bernie,2008-10-03 20:08:00,3190,Careful with your engine oils. They are not all made equal. Some are designed for specific applications. 2 stroke oils are now designed to burn to reduce emissions. Those oils that do not burn well can leave residues on rings and cylinder walls. Have seen the results of cheap oils in my shop.
255159,ecmilley,2008-10-03 21:23:00,2163,"don't own anything with a 2-smoke other than a weed eater these days, but when i was running  2stroke sleds i had some great results with amsoil interceptor oil, I bought a litre at CT for around $12.00 last winter for an old sled, but with the newer engine technology i would stick with oem oils.  In answer to your question though CT oil is made by imperial (esso) nothing wrong with using it, I can't vouch for wallymart oil don't kknow the standards for that. but i have seen 1 gallon jugs of dino oil for under 20 bux and synthetic for around 45 a gallon"
255188,Muskieman,2008-10-03 23:15:00,2472,"Eh!   In general oil isn't equal.... here's a secret...  Shell Oil is also Quaker State and Pennzoil, based out of  in Texas.... my sales rep has a Shell Jacket on a Pennzoil shirt and a Quaker hat on his head when he walks through my door.  as for Oil ... if past warranty use a well priced ""BRANDED""... TCW3 rated 2 stroke oil ...  Castrol Super 2 stroke 500ml is 3.49$ at my shop...not available in  946ml.  Pennzoil 946ml..4.99/ L  Evinrude XD50/ gal ...34.99     XD100...44.95  Amzoil Fully Synthetic...Injection Oil....7.29/L...          28.99/ gal  Royal Purple......8.99 /L..........34.99/gal  should be about the same ...everywhere  Oil Prices do fluctuate with the barrel price.  Happy Mixing.. :Gonefishing:"
255206,Fang,2008-10-04 00:23:00,1330,Here's my results after a year on the BPS TCW3 they put on sale for under $10 a jug.  Anyone want it????  After a season of limited hours I checked my plugs and have never seen as much crud. I'll be using merc oil next year for sure
255302,Sinker,2008-10-04 02:55:00,8692,"I run the merc quicksilver oil in mine, always have, always will. Last time I bought a jug it was 40 bucks for 4 litres. Sure, its expensive, but I really think it makes a difference. If I run out and use cheap oil, I can really notice a difference in how smooth my engine runs, and how well it idles down at a troll.  Sinker"
255382,hirk,2008-10-04 15:44:00,571,"Amsoil!!!! for the price why wouldn't you? I won't load your plugs,smokes less and has higher lubricity.It has been proven in high rpm engines time and again (10K+ rpm).You won't get ring wear and no not all oil is created equal."
255423,bassfighter,2008-10-04 20:53:00,366,"Thanks for all feedback. I will try to buy from this http://www.oil-store.com/ site and get it shipped to my New york friend who is by chance coming to see me in two weeks time. Shipping within US cost another $1 for each quart.  I got lucky 6 years ago when someone sold me 30 Valvoline 2 cycle oil for $2 per quart at a close out price due to the plastic bottles being deformed, after 6 years of using them, I am about to run out of them by end of this season.  I just do not understand why shipping anything to Canada is still expensive when our currency is almost at par. while shipping within US cost hardly anything."
