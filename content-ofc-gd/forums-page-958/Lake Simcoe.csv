255115,PERCHER,2008-10-03 19:21:00,787,I was thinking about taking the young lad out on Simcoe this Saturday.But have never fished the lake when it wasn't frozen.I dont even have a clue where to launch my boat.Anybody else heading out this weekend? I was thinking Cooks Bay area maybe for some pike fun.Can any body help me out even if its just with a boat launch with a good dock and good parking?It does not have to be a free launch because I don't mind paying for the use of a quality boat ramp. Thanks in advance Dan

If you want to Launch at a marina off 89 make a right on Hwy 11 then first Left and follow that to the water.  I think the Marina is called Cook's Bay Marina.  Better launch at the end of Innisfil Rd in the park but $30 for non residents.  Also you can launch in the Holland River off of Queenston and a few other places.  Hope this helps, good luck fishing with the new boat."

255143,PERCHER,2008-10-03 20:38:00,787,I wonder if my Garmin gps comes loaded with all the boat ramps?
