254872,the spirit of fishing,2008-10-03 01:14:00,141,"Hi All; After ""lurking"" for a long time I've finally registered to be a member of this fine community. I'm fortunate enough to live in an area with good fishing opportunites (Quinte) however my most anticipated fishing time is a yearly week long trip to Northern Ontario with good friends-just accross the bay from where ""Terry"" goes in Shining Tree. Catching fish is not as important as it once was; enjoying the pursuit and all aspects of it are now much more important. My lurking in the past has been to enjoy the successes of other members through their stories and pictures; who among us doesn't enjoy the exploits of Moosebunk,Solopaddler and many others. Soon I expect I'll have my own first report up, not as spectacular as others but hopefully enjoyable. My goal will be to give back to the present and future members some of the same interest and enjoyment that you have given me."
