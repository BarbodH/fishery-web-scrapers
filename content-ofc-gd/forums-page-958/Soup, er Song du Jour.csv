255308,bigugli,2008-10-04 03:11:00,6138,  Oh soooo true. But this tune was written by a man with a fisherman's soul  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvXoWz_LlG4
255502,Clampet,2008-10-05 02:39:00,1947," Saw Rare Earth in concert in Sudbury ON, back in 70 or 71. I was 17 or 18. "
255516,CLofchik,2008-10-05 04:19:00,854,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7M1Se-p7uk  Heh thanks to this guy & Joni Mitchell generations of 'dem foreigners thought Canuckistan was populated by nothing but Liberal voting socialists that wore plaid lumberjackets.  Then they found this site......and well........nevermind.
255518,bigugli,2008-10-05 04:31:00,6138,"The ""Earth"" was a great band.  I did not catch them til the 80's live. They did a 30 minute take on 'Get Ready' that blew you away.  However, back on topic, more fishing music.  "
255520,bigugli,2008-10-05 04:38:00,6138, A lot of great talent in Yorkville passed through the doors of the Riverboat in the 60's and 70's. They got things wrong with Joni. Wouldn't give her a shot. Thought she was only good enough tobe a dishwasher. Talk about bad judgement calls.  Anybody remember Mephisto Joe?
255525,jace,2008-10-05 08:44:00,472,"  hahaha.  nice.  now if only we all had that file on our computers at that location.  If you have broadband, you can set up an icecast or shoutcast type server and stream it out."
255535,Clampet,2008-10-05 11:41:00,1947," Wow! I listened to the lyrics.. ""..on a three masted schooner out of Twillingate Isle.."" that's where me missus (Granny) comes from!"
255537,Clampet,2008-10-05 11:50:00,1947,"I don't have Broadband, just skinnyband. Can you do it?"
255540,Clampet,2008-10-05 11:52:00,1947," Although I kin play that song on guitar, I never was a fan of Neil Young."
255548,bigugli,2008-10-05 12:39:00,6138,"Just one more bit of  a sailor man's music. Just   ""rant and roar""    It also makes fer a good beer swillin tune."
255553,Clampet,2008-10-05 13:03:00,1947, Kinda reminds me of St Paddy's day.
255585,bigugli,2008-10-05 15:11:00,6138,"Yeah, but it took the ""downhomers"" to perfect it"
