They stay at memquisit was great.  We found that most of the bass were near shore at points or by fallen trees.  Here are a few pics of of the trip.  Here is a nice double header my brother and I had,    Our Cabin    Best pike of the trip.  I'm holding the fish but it was my brother beside me that caught it,    Best Largemouth of the weekend, released right after the pictures,     And finally a nice sunset on our last night  "
