Anyone ever been ice fishing there?? how is it? and how are the huts? I only ask because i have been reading some forums and every single one i read was bad. I have been trying to find a good spot to go willing to travel 1-2 hours north of Toronto but hard to find on the internet. If anyone has any info for me that would be great! or if anyone has had a great experience with a place i would love to hear it. Thanks for reading."

254535,ctdd2006,2008-10-02 03:19:00,531,Take the extra drive to Lake Nip and make a weekend of it.  The 6 man sleeper cabins are a blast!
254543,gone_fishin,2008-10-02 03:49:00,481," agreed! you wont regret that decision at all! and if you don't want t6o go that far, Simcoe would be your best bet.  I love ice fishing scugog, but i would never rent a hut there... it's not worth it in my opinion. i've got a hand auger, and i'm on good fishing grounds within a 5 minute walk... no need to rent a hut in that situation. besides... the best fishing times on scugog are 1 hour before dark through to one hour after dark... then there is a decent morning bite... but other than that... you'll be getting mostly dink perch for the rest of the day..."
254555,lunkerbasshunter,2008-10-02 04:54:00,2585,problem with southern ontario is it can be hit and miss with ice safety.  i would go north to be sure you can have safe ice for sure on your trip.  the ice cabins on nipissing are pretty crazy.  you should check them out.  cheers!
254572,rhare,2008-10-02 10:55:00,387,"Lake simcoe, without a question. Its closer and the fishing is more consistant then on Nip. I caught so many lakers last year on simcoe it was rude and that doesnt count all the big whities. GET A GOOD GUIDE, and you'll have a blast."
254638,joonmoon,2008-10-02 14:30:00,528,"Scugog is hit and miss, heres the man to talk to as far as huts go, tell him Joonmoon sent ya...Terri 705-328-3085. Depends on species of fish you're after but for lots of action I would go to Simcoe. Perch will feed all day, might have to move around a bit. Nip is farther away obviously but nothing compares to a weekend in an ice bungalow. Good luck and just do what I do....do them all..."
254803,dheitzner,2008-10-02 21:58:00,314,"Although I live a short drive from Simcoe, and fish it an awful lot in the winter, I find myself looking forward to the annual trips to Nipissing throughout the spring, through he summer and into the fall.  You really can't beat a weekend out on the ice in a bungalow. Checkout www.robhyattoutdoors.com - we have gone there 1 or 2 times per winter for the last 4 or 5 years, and have never been disappointed with the service or the fishing. Darcy"
