252938,jace,2008-09-26 17:56:00,472,"  I'd like to add that most middle sized (wider) levelwind casting reels including some ABU's are full time levelwinds so the line guide is always in front of where the line was laid on the spool.  The pawl moves and lines up with the postion of the spooled line on cast, retrieve, and line dragging out.    In contrast, I can't think of 1 low profile that has full time levelwind meaning the  pawl does NOT move every time the line moves and it's usually during cast and line dragging out.   There might be some, i just can't think of any that do, at any price.  Like others have said, this is a tough comparison.  It's like asking if you should buy a full size pickup or a toyota corolla next, there's very little common ground between them.  As a side note, I did bring a big pile of my fishing gear back to Ontario from my vacation spot.  I plan to sell most of it but haven't had time to put out any ads and the list includes a C4 6600.    boxed, new, never used.  It was a backup that i don't see myself getting into at this point."
252947,Wild,2008-09-26 18:55:00,704,"I did a little shopping myself today and I have to agree with Lew's advice, Compre 7-6  and  I chose the TE 401. Money well spent even if it's over budget because it's a quality combo that will last.  And the reel is pure man jewelery!"
253014,SlowPoke,2008-09-27 01:55:00,2984," The Curado 300 is unchanged for '09 - good luck finding one under $100. The Citica is far too small for muskie fishing. Not enough spool, not enough stopping power. It may do fine for incidental muskie catches but I'd never recommend one for a dedicated muskie setup. -Brian"

253166,Dabluz,2008-09-28 03:05:00,701," If the line guide follows the line from side to side during the cast, this means that the bar that moves the pawl must turn and also the gears that turn the bar are also moving.  This adds a lot of resistance to the spool itself.  It is no longer turning free.  This greatly reduces the speed of the spool.  The speed of the spool is essential for long casts.  Some low profile reels have a self-centering line guide that eliminates the worst resistance (when the guide is to one side while the line is leaving the spool from the other side of the reel).  The only way to really increase casting distance is to do what the long distance pros do.....that is to completely remove the line guide and the whole assembly that moves the line guide from side to side.  This means that the angler must manually move the line from one side of the reel to the other with his thumb and forefinger.  Actually, it is quite easy to do and does become quite automatic.  I have a few reels for deep water ice-fishing ( 200 to 700 feet ) that have had the line guides removed.  I fish all winter on the Saguenay River and the temperatures vary from -10 C (nice day) to -35 (not so nice) and sometimes even colder (especially at night).  I sometimes use wire line during the summer and wire line destroys the line guide.  There is always the fact that even though the line guide on many reels is always engaged, this does not mean that the line guide will be always in line with the line on the spool.  When using my low profile baitcasters and even my round reels (Cardiff 101A or Calyx 100A), my drag is adjusted quite low.  Just before making a cast, I often center the line guide in the middle by turning the handle of the reel against the drag and then disengaging everything for the cast by pressing the casting bar.  The Cardif which is a round reel and the low profile reels have rather narrow spools so the angle that the line leaves the spool is never really a problem unless I'm casting very light lures (1/8 to 1/4 ounce).  But these reels are not musky reels."
253167,danbo,2008-09-28 03:22:00,2646,So?...whatcha get??
253323,Fisherpete,2008-09-28 22:22:00,1814,"LOL nothing yet, my bonus is on my pay on October 4th  Leaning towards the 7'6"" Compre and Calcutta CT-200GTB (unless this is too small of a reel?) I like the idea that it is a few ounces lighter than the 400 series.  Combo should end up around $400 or so. (yeesh, couch time if wifey finds out)  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp08/fishi...mano_curado.pdf  Keep the debate going... I have learned tons about reels in the past week!"
253337,Wild,2008-09-28 22:41:00,704,Nope go with the 400 series it has a lower ratio and 5 pounds stronger drag. And go with the TE series not the CT. Go to Shimano.com and download the 2009 cat and see the specs for yourself.
253444,Dabluz,2008-09-29 02:53:00,701,"I glanced over the specs for the different models of Calcutta 300 and 400 and for someone who spends 90% of his time casting for musky, I would seriously consider an Abu Garcia 6500 C3 because of the tremendous price difference even though it is not considered as robust as the Calcutta.  You can buy 3 Abu Garcia reels for the price of one Calcutta.  If the line guide does not disengage on the Abu Garcia, I would remove the whole assembly so that the spool will be as free spooling as possible.  You will see that when you are holding your rod and reel in your left hand with the handle of the rod under your left arm, your left thumb and forefinger will have no trouble guiding the line evenly on the spool.  Check this site:  http://www.birds-eye.net/fishing/musky_beginner_setup.htm"
253469,SlowPoke,2008-09-29 09:29:00,2984," I'm not an Abu fan but I'll defend their casting ability - no need to remove the guide provided you have a nice arm/rod/reel/lure match. It was fun watching muskiestudd casting a Rattlin' Spot halfway across the river with an Abu 7000 on Saturday.  Comparing a Calcutta to an Abu is analogous to comparing a Tekota 600 to a Penn 209 - The Abu/Penn offer function and dependability while the Shimano reels add refinement to the mix.  Fisherpete, the CT200GTB is a very nice reel but chucking and jerking big baits is going to be hard on that reel. I think Clive (mepps) would be the first to tell you that the Calcutta 200 is a great reel - he has a lot of miles and landed a lot of monsters on his but a dedicated muskie reel, it ain't.  -Brian"
253471,danbo,2008-09-29 09:47:00,2646,"Save some $$ get a 7' 1pc,Berkley Tactix Musky rod. Abu C4 is a decent reel for heavy baits too!  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults"
253536,Spiel,2008-09-29 13:32:00,9065,....I recently picked up a St Croix Triumph musky rod. Seemed solid enough though I never landed any giants with it. Price was a very reasonable $109.99. Just be sure to check that the reel seat is in-line with the guides.
254975,jace,2008-10-03 11:58:00,472," Yes, that's how it works with most levelwind larger reels.   The line pawl is always engaged and it moved on all line motion, in or out.   It does have an effect on casting distance but it's negligible.  If you're using a bigger reel, you're probably casting larger baits so that will pull hard enough.   with a decent reel, you'll have no problem casting lures under 1/2 Oz with 300/400 size reels with levelwind although i woudln't try something delicate like a worm on a hook.  Levelwinds are common with surf fishermen who cast a few hundred yards but if you're talking competitive casting, yes, most of them will remove anything that might shorten a cast.     Yes it is.  On a full time levelwind, the line will ALWAYS be in a straight path off the spool and through the line guide.  There is absolutely no movement of the line that does not make the line pawl move whether it's casting, reeling, or drag feeding out or spinning the spool back with your thumb.   The only time the line goes out of alignment is when you remove the reel's side plate which separates the gears, remove the spool,  or reel in the loose end and spin it around the spool a few times    This only works on smaller reels that disengage the levelwind during cast.  On larger reels (usually over 250 size) where the levelwind is always engaged, holding the spool and winding with the clutch engaged and loosened drag only spins the handle on the drag discs -- the spool and levelwind do not move and the line stays in alignment with the line guide under normal usage."
254979,jace,2008-10-03 12:10:00,472,"  I don't know why but this line reminded me of an episode of ""Extreme fishing with Robson Green"" i watched the other day.  It was in South Africa and he's fishing from shore with a local guide and borrowed gear.  The guide hands him a long surf rod with a good sized casting reel and he wails on it to make his first cast without thumbing the spool and gets the biggest knot i've ever seen.  He let the spool spin like it was attached to a drill.   ...and then he admits to that being his first time with a casting reel.  ahah.  From the way they edited the footage, i would guess he did it a few more times in quick succession before giving up and demanding a spinning reel."
252311,lew,2008-09-24 09:23:00,12767,"I've been using both Premiers & Avids for muskies for a few years now but am gradually switching them all over to Compres. It's a personal choice but I'm  just liking the Compres alot more lately, infact I just sold an Avid to purchase another Compre.  As Raf suggested, give some thought to moving up to at least a 7' 6"" and you won't be dissappointed in your choice as the longer rod just makes everything better.  For the reels, I'm also a fan of Shimano and have been extremely happy with my 400 CT's and then this season I've also added a 400 TE (on a new 7' 6"" Compre) and it's by far the nicest casting rod/reel combo I've ever used.  I like a dedicated rod/reel for trolling and use a Shimano Tekota 600LC  Nothing wrong with the Abu C3 and it's a reel that will serve you well for a long time. As was mentioned before, it may not be as purdy or smooth as a Calcutta, but it's tough as nails and will do the job with no problems if that's the choice you make.  Here's a thought though, you've got the $170 left over from your bonus after you purchase your rod, which in a way is ""free"" money, so why not add a bit more to it and move up to one of the Calcuttas ??  As I say, the C3 is a decent reel, but if you purchase it, then have the opportunity to try a friends Calcutta you'll be kicking yourself for not making the move when you had the chance in the 1st place.........sorta like onefootitis in a boat  Never tried the 300 Curado, but have heard good things about them.  Please let us know what you decide on."
252313,SlowPoke,2008-09-24 10:08:00,2984,"I like both the Curado 300 and Calcutta 400 - I don't own either yet but I've used them. If I had to choose right now I would break down fishing style a little more. Curado 300 is very compact and light with a high speed retrieve. I'd opt for the Curado if I intended to throw mostly inlines and spinnerbaits with a 7'-7'6"" rod. Calcutta 400 is bulkier and slower but a great jerkbait reel on a 6'6""-7' rod and doubles as a trolling reel with a built in clicker. The large spool picks up slack fast enough for jerkbaiting but it's not as fast as the Curado for burning baits. I don't think you would be disappointed with either but one may suit your immediate needs better than the other - I know I'd be happy to see either under the Christmas tree this year! -Brian"
252327,Fisherpete,2008-09-24 12:09:00,1814,"I do cast a lot of bucktails and inlines... after reading all the posts so far I am leaning towards the 7' or 7'6"" Compre with the Curado 300."
252343,Raf,2008-09-24 13:16:00,3495,Nice combo but you're well over $300.  If it's going to be strictly a buck/boo/inline rod definately go 7'6 or 8'.
252357,skrillaguerilla,2008-09-24 13:53:00,30,"I have enjoyed my Abu Garcia C4 6500 baitcaster. It is my first and only baitcasting reel i own, and i mated it with a nice 1-piece rapala hm-45 rod. It's an awesome setup for bass and larger pike, but i'm not sure how it would hold up to casting larger musky lures all season long, but i would definitely need a heavier rod to do that. It does a great job casting 3/4 and 1 ounce spoons and bucktails. I have had to have it serviced once in the 4 seasons i have owned it. I paid around $165 for the reel and $35 to service it this spring (it had salt crust in it from when i took it down south). The drag is still really smooth and it is quiet. it works great for trolling, and the clicker is nice and loud to let you know when you get a strike/snag. I used to get bird-nests in it when i try to cast light lures into the wind, but i have gotten much better at casting and it's very rare that i get tangles in it anymore. I don't think you need a magnetic anti-backlash system, but i have never tried one (i think the abu c5 green reel had one) so i can't speak of on experience. If it worked well, it probably would have been useful when i was learning to cast with it, but now that i am comfortable with it, I don't think i would ever need/want to sped the extra money to get one. You could try one of the saltwater reels too. I think the are a little heavier yet than the freshwater versions.  I don't think it's really fair to compare the Abu baitcasters to the Shimano Calcuttas. The Shimano reels are nearly 3 times as much as the Abu's. I am a firm believer of you get what you pay for, but i am happy with the value i got for my Abu reel which I bought 4 years ago. You can get the c4 for less than $100 now. I wonder if the shimano reel would last 3 times as long as the Abu?"
252729,salmon,2008-09-25 22:10:00,334, PM me if you want a good deal on a slightly used Curado300 Jose
252738,jedimaster,2008-09-25 22:49:00,3472,"I have both a Curado and an Abu C3 that I use for musky and although I do like the Abu, The Curado is a far superior reel. At least in my eyes anyway. But Heck I also use a spinning rod for musky so don't listen to me. A 7 foot compre and a Curado would be a sweet rig.  As for the reliability of Curados, I know plenty of curados plenty older than 3 years and still working perfectly cast after cast. I know lots of guys with C3's that just put up with the noise and this and that, and have them serviced and what not. But as another guy said its not fair to compare an Abu C3 to a Curado."
252924,Dabluz,2008-09-26 17:23:00,701,"There is a difference in casting distance between a low profile reel and a round reel.  If you look at a round reel, the line guide is close to the spool while the line guide on a low profile reel is further away from the spool.  This means that on a low profile baitcaster, the line leaves the spool at a lower angle (if the line is at the far end of the spool) than on a round baitcaster.  This means reduced resistance.  Imagine the resistance when the line guide is to the far left while the line is coming off the spool from the far right.  On top of that, low profile baitcasters usually have a narrower spool which further decreases the maximum angle that the line has to make between the spool and the line guide.  However, there is the difference in line capacity and there are no real big low profile reels to compensate for the difference in line capacity.  Fortunately, the new braided lines are 50% smaller than equivalent monos and that has helped to increase the line capacity for the low profile reels.  Since 90% of your fishing for musky is casting, I would recommend a low profile reel.  I'm sure you can find a great but used Curado 300 for under 100 dollars because the 2009 Curado 300 is now on the market.  Everyone with the old Curados will want to buy the new Curado that has been upgraded quite a bit.  I think that maybe a new 2009 Citica would be okay for musky.  The only difference between this new reel and the new Curado is in the number of bearings."
