254503,chickenhawk,2008-10-02 02:02:00,612,mmmmmmmmm them lakers look tasty!!!    Hawk
254504,Mike the Pike,2008-10-02 02:03:00,3421,Looks like a good time Doug were you with yout Dad and was that his fully loaded boat .Who did you share this wonderful time with.  Next time don't hide that nice trout with your big mitts  I admit I don't hold pike nicely but my hands are much smaller than yours
254509,douG,2008-10-02 02:09:00,2693,"Beats, you are right along with me there.  I couldn't add words to describe this trip.  Since you asked, the weather was fabulous, no rain for six nights, and we swam on that sandy beach every day.  There was a day trip to Langford, where that scrappy splake was fooled with a blown worm on a barrel weight in 15 fow.  Most of those lakers were caught in 25-35 over 40-50 fow, but the bigfish was caught 55 feet down.  Small bodybaits and spoons in natural patterns took almost all the lakers, trolled between 2.2 and 2.8 km/hr.  Lil cleos, phoebes in silver/blue and blk/sil rapalas and other naturals worked best."
254515,Joey,2008-10-02 02:21:00,9122,"Wow, great commentary, you certainly have a way with words DouG  Looks like the weather and fish cooperated.  Lovely pictures Doug.  Joey"

254533,douG,2008-10-02 03:16:00,2693,"Jeeze, Mike.  I am already WAY overspent on the domestic currency as it is.  That was six nights in, just last week.  I need some of your sales skilz.  Sry.  I wish, and keep me in mind pls."
