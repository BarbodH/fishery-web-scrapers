Saturday went out with some friends and their 2 year old son, and my wife and our boy.We set up a day camp and headed out in seperate boats, we caught some jackfish...and a full stringer (limit) of walleye and had a fish fry supper at our house that evening.  On Sunday we dropped off our boy with the babysitter, who lives in the same bay as us and took off for a few hours to hunt for Jackfish and bass...my wife does not care for walleye fishing too much...but loves throwing spinners/topwaters for pike and bass.    SATURDAY MORNING I WAS UP AT 0415.....GIVING UP SMOKING PLAING HAVOC WITH MY SLEEP....BUT IT DID MEAN I GOT TO WATCH THE SUN COME UP               WE HEADED OFF 1 HOUR LATE TO MEET THE OTHERS WHO WERE PUTTING IN AT THE LANDING.            GOT TO OUR SPOT ON THE LAKE AND EVERYONE HELPED SET UP              AFTER SETTING UP CAMP WE HEADED OUT IN SEPARATE BOATS, A FEW FISH LANDED....MORE ABOUT ENTERTAINING THE KIDS THOUGH.         AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS FISHING, JACK WAS READY FOR A REST AND LUNCH....ME TOO         WE CAME BACK IN FOR SMOKIES ON THE BBQ WHILE THE 2 BOYS HAD A BIT OF AN EXPLORATION OF THE CAMPSITE                              AFTER LUNCH JACK AND MUM WENT FOR A NAP AND GARNET, MICHELLE AND THEIR BOY GARRET CAME OUT IN MY BOAT IN SEARCH OF WALLEYE...WE FOUND THEM.....DUNNO WHY I DID NOT TAKE PICS THOUGH?!      MUM AND JACK MUST'VE BEEN EXAUSTED, THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP STILL AFTER 3 HOURS, JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS SUCH A COOL PIC OF THEM SLEEPING...EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION...GENETICS?             On Sunday my wife and i went out for bass and jackfish, we spent a couple hours out there then pulled up at our neighbours dock and picked up Jack. Jack did not want to go in yet so we fished in our bay for another 1/2 hour.
