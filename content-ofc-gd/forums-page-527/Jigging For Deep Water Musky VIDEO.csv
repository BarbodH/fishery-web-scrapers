591316,BillM,2011-06-09 03:40:00,17367,"Brandon, how do you find the still shots it takes?  I have a major trip coming up next year and this would be great for some underwater shots (opposed to dunking my DSLR)"
591318,brandon,2011-06-09 03:54:00,857,"I actually hadn't used it for stills until earlier today.  I brought with me when I went to my mom's for a swim and just set it to automatically take a photo every 2 seconds.  I'll post a couple of the shots below.  And not only can you have it automatically shoot every 2/5/10/30/60 seconds, but you can also use a self timer or triple shot mode. Here's 2 shots from earlier today so you can be the judge   Swimming with my GoPro by bbroderick86, on Flickr    Poolside with Canon and my GoPro by bbroderick86, on Flickr  And here's what a still that's taken from a GoPro video looks like   Musky Video Still by bbroderick86, on Flickr"
591319,BillM,2011-06-09 03:55:00,17367,"Yeah, I think I'll be picking one of these up!!  Great job man!  (And I gotta apologize for not introducing myself at the Barrie Facts of Fishing, I thought that was you!)"
591320,Cudz,2011-06-09 04:12:00,2652,very cool Brandon.  I liked everything about that vid.  Taping editing shots hookset and fish.  Loved it.
591325,alphaalpha,2011-06-09 09:08:00,475,"awesome video, thanks for posting!   -AA"
591438,esoxansteel,2011-06-09 19:13:00,1307,"Wow Brandon and Jon if that dont get your musky mojo going your likely dead, Very informative and thanx for including the essential release tools required for musky fishing, The best video ive ever seen, hands down, and thanx Bradon for your secrets to great photography and the tools or camera used in the making of the vid"
591459,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-09 20:36:00,2690,Very entertaining stuff Brandon!!  Also extremely informative...another presentation/tool in the arsenal.
591472,landry,2011-06-09 21:04:00,1005,
591491,spincast,2011-06-09 22:30:00,3279,excellent vid all around - thanks.
591685,brandon,2011-06-10 17:06:00,857,"Thanks again everyone, glad you enjoyed it!"
591697,SilverCreek,2011-06-10 17:24:00,3,Very cool. Certainly a fantastic show of the lures capabilities. Thanks for sharing!
591710,Diltsy,2011-06-10 18:04:00,22,"For all the guys wondering about the gopro - I have also been looking into getting one but was really unimpressed with the image quality underwater. That would be the main reason for the purchase for me, so I was a little upset. I found this video that shows how to fix the problem.    This camera seems like a beast for things above water, but if you're like me and looking for some below water action just keep this in mind!"
591949,Handlebarz,2011-06-11 12:05:00,3790,there are some interesting  things out there for fixes for underwater I guess if i get one I will have to see how it works for me underwater before I buy the extra fixes or make one.  I thought it would be cool to put the head set on when some one or myself is fighting a musky then when its time to land the fish you get my view of things then I would hope to set the camera down up front on the boat so I can get some video of the fish as we take it out for pictures.  I want to also try underwater videos but might hold off at first.
591987,brandon,2011-06-11 17:22:00,857,I can't believe I forgot to mention the terrible underwater quality.  But like others have said there's options out there to fix the problem.  I just ordered 2 of these off ebay to allow me to shoot underwater - http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=260797363588&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT#ht_1119wt_1141
591992,solopaddler,2011-06-11 17:42:00,8605,Brandon that was incredible!
591994,Spiel,2011-06-11 17:48:00,9065,"  Agree 100%, thanks Brandon."
592004,misfish,2011-06-11 19:07:00,29133,"That was totally cool Brandon.   Bill ,I was talking to SteveR at the spring show, and didnt even regonize Brandon til he handed me his card."
592238,Handlebarz,2011-06-12 18:28:00,3790,Dang was looking at the Adobe Premiere it sure is pricey is there something a little less for us that would not be using it weekly?
592284,brandon,2011-06-12 22:23:00,857,"Once again thanks to everyone who's watched the video....over 3400 views now!! and Mike, A cheaper yet still very capable editing program is Final Cut Express.  It retails for around $199.  It was the stepping stone program I used while making the jump from imovie to Premiere and I liked it a lot."
592292,Leecher,2011-06-12 22:36:00,7832,Awesome video Brandon I almost jumped out of my seat on the hook set Great job to the both of you Thanks for sharing Leechman
590531,brandon,2011-06-07 06:49:00,857,"I got out with Jon Bondy again yesterday to do some more filming.  This time we focused on Jigging for Deep Water Musky.  It's a very informative video and at around the 9:10 mark a Musky makes an appearance!  Enjoy!  <iframe width=""853"" height=""510"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/sCniMseL7Vk?hd=1"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  For those interested it was shot with a Canon 1D mk IV and Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L Lens with a shotgun mic on the camera's hot shoe.  The section of the fish being netted was shot with a GoPro Hero.  The video was edited using Adobe Premiere."
590533,Roy,2011-06-07 07:06:00,13728,"A really good informative, well executed video, Brandon. Congrats to you and Jon."

590539,Handlebarz,2011-06-07 10:06:00,3790,Great Video Brandon congrats to you guys your making some very informative videos down here.  I hope the GOPRO was water proof.  I have been trying the jigging but have not landed a fatty yet. I have had a few bumps but know I need to add more time doing it.
590561,danbouck,2011-06-07 11:16:00,4380,Great vid!
590572,aplumma,2011-06-07 12:12:00,6896,Nice job guys the info was great and the filming was as usual very impressive.   Art
590739,brandon,2011-06-07 23:02:00,857,"Glad you guys enjoyed it!  And Mike, the GoPro is waterproof and thankfully I was able to grab the net quickly with my left hand before it sank!  And for those interested, here's the netcam footage from when the net fell overboard! <iframe width=""853"" height=""510"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/yvbq_7GLGXI?hd=1"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

590881,lunkerbasshunter,2011-06-08 02:45:00,2585,good vid.  I have a buddy who swears the biggest esox are down in 25-30 ft of water.  cheers!

590905,fishnsled,2011-06-08 03:51:00,3520,Guess I know what I'll use my Bass Pro gift card for now. Great information and nicely shot.
590913,adempsey,2011-06-08 04:38:00,1498,Thanks for the video.  It was well done.

590946,Basskicker,2011-06-08 11:27:00,421,Sweet video man....I absolutely love my Go Pro.
590953,aplumma,2011-06-08 11:42:00,6896,Brandon hows about a short review and video of the gopro please.   Art
591037,brandon,2011-06-08 16:20:00,857,"Hey Art,  I love my GoPro!  Last week I took it skydiving and this week I had it musky fishing so it's quite versatile.  It's waterproof to 180', wearable/mountable pretty much anywhere, and can take either photos or videos in full HD.  Here's a link to the full specs http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-helmet-hero-camera/  And if you scroll up to Post #7 in this topic, I posted the video of the GoPro on the net as the net fell overboard just so you can see the qualities of it's waterproof housing..."
591054,aplumma,2011-06-08 17:07:00,6896,Thanks Brandon I will put it on my wish list.   Art
591174,davis,2011-06-08 21:36:00,128, You won't regret it! It's an amazing little camera.  Great video Brandon. I've never seen anyone jig for muskie - that hookset was awesome!
591246,trapshooter,2011-06-09 00:36:00,1234,Tell John Bondy that I showed Linda Rice this video and she is ordering some of his baits for her musky shop here on Lac Seul.
591251,brandon,2011-06-09 00:44:00,857,will do!
591309,young_one,2011-06-09 03:26:00,620,"Awesome video, its one of the most informative video clips out there! Keep up the good work!!! A tutorial for deep water summer smallmouth in the future?"
591311,rufus,2011-06-09 03:30:00,267,I watched the video last night and bought a Bondy Bait today. You should get a commission
591314,brandon,2011-06-09 03:36:00,857,young_one - thanks!  I'll pass the suggestion along to Jon! NWO Fishing - lol I'll let Jon know your suggestion as well - but on a serious note I'll let be sure to let him know he's got a new customer!  Thanks to everyone who's watched the video so far...Almost 2000 views in less than 48 hrs!
