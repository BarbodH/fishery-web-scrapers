592095,TJQ,2011-06-12 00:21:00,7806,"My friends at Golden Eagle Camp said they were gonna come to visit with some atvrs from atvnation.com....	what a great bunch of people 19 or 20.... brought cookies!! I hauled some pike outta the river and did up a fish fry for them, plus they were pretty wet and cold, so we bucked the stove..... It was quite interesting to meet people doing a g2g from another whole community... its nice to know that OFC is not alone in our type of endeavours.       "

592124,dhickey,2011-06-12 01:48:00,1038,  Dont have the status to say that but was thinking it....  I will shut up now.
592127,irishfield,2011-06-12 01:53:00,26272,Nobody could find the place originally... TJ wasn't even sure if he could get to it by ATV when he bought the lot. Now there's a beaten trail... already had an outboard stolen... and now a herd to the door. TJ... please put a lock on the fridge and hid the key somewhere!!!
592128,kickingfrog,2011-06-12 01:56:00,8333," ... and some flyboy dropped in on him, then posted the photos on the net."

592161,Handlebarz,2011-06-12 05:23:00,3790,Looks like fun I know that a dodge Caravan can NOT make it into Jiggy but it could make it close to the trail where one would off load a atv.
592169,Roy,2011-06-12 09:55:00,13728,"'Twas only a matter of time. You're both very welcoming, entertaining folks. Sounds like a party and a half, Bud. Thanks for the pics. The next time, there'll be a bonus in it for you if you include a pic of Monique."
