592613,limeyangler,2011-06-13 20:47:00,5204,WTG Joey....what a piggy salmon....fantastic  I dont think that fish should be allowed in the competition as it clearly states in the regs that the date on the card has to be in RED....  :rofl2:

592891,solopaddler,2011-06-14 09:40:00,8605,Gorgeous looking fish! Must have been anadventure trying to grab them.
592895,Rich Clemens,2011-06-14 09:56:00,3131,"Congrats Joey.   Good to see you were able to land that one with no net.  But, I'll bet there's a wee bit bigger one out there with your name on it.   Just getting warmed up now."
592269,Joey,2011-06-12 21:36:00,9122,"Headed out to the big lake this morning and it was like a comedy of errors I'll tell ya.  We got launched no problem and headed out and then stopped the boat at the area we wanted to start fishing, about 150 FOW, to set up.  As soon as Paul turned the engine off we could hear the trim going.  The engine was stuck in the trim down position.  After unhooking it from the battery and taking the engine cover off and cursing, Paul finally had an AHA moment and went up on the deck and lifted the rain suit bag off the trim switch  Sooooo, as I drove Paul set up two lines to start, sat down and said ""Oh crap, I forgot the net.""  Oh well, we were there, lets fish dangit!!!  Right off the get go we had a line peeler.  I was first up and after some fun times trying to hand bomb it into the boat, we had our first fish landed      Had a few moments to breath and relax before the next fish!      We kept passing by these huge bait balls and they were so thick the lines would shake and vibrate the whole time as they passed through and dinged off the bait.       We missed two hits, or they just did not commit, and then paul had a good fish on.  Of course I had to take his rod at the end so he could hand bomb this one too     Back to my turn again and this one screamed off line, did several acrobatics and then headed to the bottom, peeling off about 200 feet of line.  It was a long and heavy fight to get her in.  I figured no way was this one gonna be easy to get hand bombed and into the boat, but Paul managed to do it.  My PB Salmon     39 inches, a few quick pics and back into the drink she went.  No time to weigh, I wanted her to live.          We headed back in as the bite seemed to turn off and found this biker on shore!!  Great to see you again Peter and nice bike        Found this hijacker in the livewell.  Now it is hopefully some turkey vulture or hawk's next meal.       Couple of young goslings losing their down.       Great day on the water, a bit windy and lots of whitecaps for awhile, but had a good time.  Cheers,  Joey"
