591180,Big Cliff,2011-06-08 21:40:00,6899,"Missed us, knocked our lawn furnature and things around but no serious damage. Bobcayegon apparently has quite a bit of damage and Hwy. 35 is closed North of Fenelon with trees and power lines down.  If you know anyone in those areas and need me to check on them just let me know. I also have a portable 6500 watt generator that I would loan out if needed.  705-328-0577"
