Hundreds of people attended and enjoyed a fun filled day outside fishing and meeting new friends.   The Minister of Tourism, Hon. Michael Chan stopped by to enjoy some fishing with the kids and filmed a TV segment with Angler and Hunter TV show host Mike Miller.   The fish were biting and I'm happy to announce that these new young anglers learned quickly how to land some great fish. Every child who attended won prizes. Many Thanks to the sponsors of the festival that make this possible.    Our wonderful featured charity Emmanual's Wish Foundation, raised some funds by hosting the very popular Minnow Races.  But most importantly, a fun day was had by the families and friends, who attended the Rice Lake Fishing Festival Family day.   Thank You  Mike and Andrea"
