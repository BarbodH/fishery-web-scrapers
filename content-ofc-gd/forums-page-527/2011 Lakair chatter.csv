592657,ChrisK,2011-06-13 21:56:00,2772,Who wants to do a shore lunch on Tombstone Friday afternoon For those of you who have never had the pleasure Tombstone is an island at the mouth of West Bay leading into the Muskrats. It overlooks the West Bay and all its glory. One of the best elevated stone islands with a view and a great place to park your boat and have shore lunch. Last year we missed the opportunity to do the event due to planning issues but this year I would like to put the wheels in motion and get everyone out there for a fun afternoon.  ChrisK
592660,Spiel,2011-06-13 21:58:00,9065, How are you going to get there Chris.....
592665,irishfield,2011-06-13 22:18:00,26272,Maybe he could water ski behind the plane.....  The bridge is gonna suck though... I'm not going under it !
592667,Spiel,2011-06-13 22:21:00,9065,"  I'm sure you could do it Wayne, just keep the rods in the plane....."
592668,misfish,2011-06-13 22:23:00,29133," Are you sure you will have enough eyes to feed all by then?   Been awhile Chris,but I can still handle a TILLER.   That would be extream and would pay to see."
592675,Spiel,2011-06-13 22:30:00,9065," It's a 75 tiller Brian, you up to it?"
592677,aplumma,2011-06-13 22:32:00,6896,As long as the two Chris's don't play outboard motor and tiller in the cabin things will be o.k.   Art
592682,misfish,2011-06-13 22:35:00,29133," Hell, I can handle a 1975 tiller with a blind fold, no prob."
592689,Spiel,2011-06-13 22:43:00,9065, Funny boy....LOL  I should have said 75 horse tiller.
585192,aplumma,2011-05-20 10:50:00,6896,Time to wind up and get planning for the fun this year.  After all the trophy is leaving Canada this year for it's new home in the USA.   Art
585197,Rich Clemens,2011-05-20 11:37:00,3131,  That's right.  Already have a nice spot picked out on the entertainment center for it.   really looking forward to catching up with good friends I only see once a year.   Looks like we'll have some new faces this year and make some new friends.  Just an all around dang good/fun time.     Oh yeah - that 50 incher out there ... I got my camera ready for ya.  We're bringing our son-in-law this time.   This will be his first ever Canadian Adventure and he's been looking forward to this since late last year.   Oh yeah - no dogs on this trip.
585231,irishfield,2011-05-20 14:23:00,26272,"But what if Leah and I drop in from the sky, fish off the dock and fly away with said trophy at the end of the day....."
585310,pikeguy,2011-05-20 21:24:00,195,ha ha. think i might go and stock up that little bay not to far away with all the big ones that i catch then i will win the trophy
585374,John,2011-05-21 15:06:00,2956,Too bad you are not bringing the girls this year Rich.
586851,SlowPoke,2011-05-26 14:34:00,2984," WHAT?!?!?!? Nobody will recognize ya's! LOL   I had really hoped to make the trip this year but may not be able to. If I do, I'll boatless and homeless while I'm up there! My boat is still in storage and I haven't made any reservations because this past month has been crazy to say the least! It may not stop me from shooting up there for the weekend but I won't know until last minute."
586879,Spiel,2011-05-26 16:33:00,9065," If you can show up Brian, do so I'll make sure you're looked after with roof and boat. Mind ya ChrisK is in charge of my boat keys so you'll likely have to spend time with him....."
586937,motv8tr,2011-05-26 19:36:00,2587,"Hey Brian, if I manage to make it for the day I'd be happy to split the cost of a boat rental on Saturday...  maureen"
586988,SlowPoke,2011-05-26 21:54:00,2984,"I appreciate the offer Chris. I can think of worse things than being stuck in a boat with ChrisK; (A)it's not enclosed and (B)at least we'll find fish!   Cool Mo, might just take you up on it but don't wait to make plans; I may not make it there at all."
587020,ChrisK,2011-05-26 22:56:00,2772,Come and get it !! :tease:  :tease:  
587028,irishfield,2011-05-26 23:16:00,26272,"I don't know Chris... it's a pretty foamy looking beer, have you got a fresh one?"
587152,ChrisK,2011-05-27 10:00:00,2772,What you talkin bout Wayne ?? That was a fresh one with some mighty fine head on it. You must be drinkin that watered down store bought brew that doesn't hold a head on it for more than 10 seconds
587825,misfish,2011-05-29 18:16:00,29133,The tourneys on Saturday?
587826,Spiel,2011-05-29 18:19:00,9065, Yes Sir.
588028,Rich Clemens,2011-05-30 11:19:00,3131,"  And the fish fry, the picnic, the camp fires, and all the fire-side chats and sharing of stories.  (Some true and maybe some stretched a bit).  Looking forward to putting some faces to some new names.  Oh yeah, and some items to sweeten the prize table.  Picked up some stuff at the Harrisburg Sport show this year.  Hope I remember to pack it."
588073,aplumma,2011-05-30 14:43:00,6896,It is amazing how the prize table fills up from all of the generous donations from those that show up. We also like to thank our sponsors that have been very generous also even when they can not make it to the get together. It seems every year everyone gets a little something for their enjoyment no matter what place they come in. So if you have something for the table new or used feel free to bring it with you it will find a new home and you can be sure a smile from it's new owner. Don't forget to bring your appetite T.J. and the crew cook up a mean mess of fish.    Art
588082,misfish,2011-05-30 15:26:00,29133,"I,ll be bring a box of plastic baits and hooks for the table."
589516,Rich Clemens,2011-06-03 18:15:00,3131,Just two weeks from right now .... I'll be within two hours of Lakair. Looking forward to seeing old friends and making some new ones. Anxiety is building to get out on the water for the first time this year.
589532,Spiel,2011-06-03 18:41:00,9065, I'm looking forward to seeing you and Patsy again Rich but Brook is upset that your not bringing her friends.
589534,John,2011-06-03 18:48:00,2956, When are you guys headed up Chris? Barbara and I should arrive late morning Friday.
589540,Spiel,2011-06-03 18:54:00,9065, Uncertain yet John.
589600,lew,2011-06-03 21:18:00,12766, Diane and I will be arriving early Thursday afternoon Rich and it'll be good to see you and Patsy again.
589625,Rich Clemens,2011-06-03 23:30:00,3131,  Ditto.  Maybe we can check out the F150's.
589736,misfish,2011-06-04 15:30:00,29133,"  I,ll be leaving mine at home.Take the focus. Easier on the wallet.   Just in time to open the bar."
589814,John,2011-06-04 22:20:00,2956,Just in time to open the bar.   Sounds perfect Brian...
