592510,Guidofisherman,2011-06-13 14:32:00,206,"Finally got out in my new boat for some brook trout action. Great to get back on the water, especially in my new boat which worked well. The 60 hp pushed it along fine and trolled economically in the current. The custom decal was made from one of my own photos of a brook trout. The first fish measured 20.5""x14.5"" and weighted almost 6 lbs. A great start to the season.          "

592701,Moosebunk,2011-06-13 22:57:00,3970,"What Wayne said...  The same boat was parked beside me on the highway a few weeks back.  We were going in opposite directions but had the windows down and shared a laugh.  I was pulling my Rebel, him his.  Both with the windows down we just looked at each other and he said ""like the boat man"" at the same time I said, ""sweet ride dood.""  Great fish and decal Al, and welcome to the club."
