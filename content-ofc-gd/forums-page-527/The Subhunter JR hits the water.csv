She's got a minor water leak that I need to find and repair and the motor is going to need a hydrofoil to help get the stern higher in the water, but other than that all went very well. It's perfect for one, but I don't know if it will be big enough to fish two out of. I'll have to try it out and see. The boating was ok but the fishing sucked today. Could have had something to do with the high winds and water temps in the mid to high 30's.  I had a couple of pictures of her, but Solopaddlers pike post has blown my photobucket bandwidth it seems.    <_<"

593110,solopaddler,2011-06-14 22:22:00,8605,When you come to your senses and realize it's far too small for you I'll happily take it off your hands!
593111,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-14 22:24:00,10439,  Not so far. I need one of them stingray hydrfoil thingies to get it to plane out properly. I kind of thought it would before I even had it out as these inflatables all tend to be difficult to get on plane due to their design. Hopefully that will do the trick. It's comfortable for one to fish out of though.  On the capacity plate it is rated for up to a 4HP so I have no worries about it self destructing Hopper San. I do want to try it out on my Fishcat Cougar though. Might have to name her Miss Fishwiser if I do.
