592588,linweir,2011-06-13 19:18:00,202,I will vote Starcraft in terms of functionality/price.
592611,Raf,2011-06-13 20:40:00,3495,"happy with my mirrocraft - although i've been on many different brands, i am somewhat new to boat ownership."

592905,Fish Farmer,2011-06-14 11:40:00,2234,"Princecraft, I've had 3 and I'd never buy another. Alright on a mill pond. No good on big water. If I had to do it over. I'd go Harborcraft or Stanley or west coast boats mentioned above."
592914,fishindevil,2011-06-14 12:03:00,6254,#1 LUND or #2 SMOKERCRAFT !!!!
592942,anders,2011-06-14 13:26:00,1168,"I just bought a 16.5 alumacraft this spring with a 50 etec tiller...does 30mph and hour.  Wonderful ride, smooth, stable and dry.  Last night was going full throttle in 3-4 ft waves on superior and it handled like it was calm out there.  However, there are many good choices out there.  PS Bought from the states and saved a lot of money!"
592948,blue pickeral,2011-06-14 13:50:00,267, Interesting. I'm finding while shopping around that new boat prices in the U.S. according to this site:  http://www.seedealercost.com/boats  are very similar to the prices I am being quoted by Canadian dealers.  Did you purchase a used boat in the U.S.? Would like to hear other experiences regards U.S./Canadian boat purchases.
593056,mattybculp,2011-06-14 19:28:00,388,No i did not purchase my used boat in the US but would like to hear your experience with both . Thanks
591821,mattybculp,2011-06-10 23:44:00,388,"hey guys ,im looking at possibly buying a new or used boat. i have done some reasearch into some boats manufacuters ie crestliner,lund,legend etc. im looking for something in the 16 - 18 ft range and i would be happy if it pushes along at 30 mph. this will be my second boat i had a 17 ft princecraft before which i had to sell to go to school. anywhoo any advice good or bad on some aluminum deep hull boats would be much appreciated. just want to be as informed as possible . what kinda boats you guys driving or reccomend . they all claim to be the best . thanks for you input"
591829,irishfield,2011-06-10 23:58:00,26272,"If you had a Princecraft... you don't have a lot of research to do or wiggle room to improve on that brand, other than maybe a Lund."
591830,PERCHER,2011-06-10 23:59:00,787,LUND
591832,33825,2011-06-11 00:01:00,7,"My 1976 Springbok 18' aluminum bowrider still floats, and I am absolutely in love with it.  Good luck with the purchase!  Keep your hooks sharp!"
591833,mercman,2011-06-11 00:10:00,7054,"PrinceCraft.The the best bang for the buck out there, IMHO.Love mine"
591834,kuhaman,2011-06-11 00:11:00,503,Love my LUND!!!You can get pretty good bang for the buck with a Legend though.
591842,Pigeontroller,2011-06-11 00:48:00,2793,"I'd never buy a Princecraft, a friend had one, the windshield kept breaking due to a frame problem and they told him to lump it!"
591845,spincast,2011-06-11 00:58:00,3279,My (new to me) Starcraft has done me well. Very well - recommend them any time
591848,scugpg,2011-06-11 01:20:00,1373,Lund princecraft and crestliner have always been the ones people recommend to me whenever the question comes up
591897,bow slayer,2011-06-11 03:24:00,1074,"i have owned my 16 ft starcraft for 5 years now,not one complaint ,love it would buy another in a heartbeat."
591898,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-11 03:28:00,1351,1 more vote for lund
591904,mrpike,2011-06-11 04:00:00,151,I have had two LUNDS and never had a problem and the resale is always been great. LUND has always been knowen for its top quality. you just can't go wrong with a LUND.
591908,Sinker,2011-06-11 04:29:00,8692,STARCRAFT  Just do a search for problems with a starcraft aluminum hull. Good luck!  Let me know if you find any........  S.
591910,zamboniwaterboy,2011-06-11 04:34:00,126,Just came across this brand and it looks interesting.  A bit bigger than you are looking for.   http://www.duckworthboats.com/model-pro_7_series.html  
591943,green&orange,2011-06-11 11:49:00,31,"  Lund, Alumacraft, Princecraft, Starcraft, Crestliner all build quality boats.  IMO the layout of the boat that fits your needs is more important than the name of the builder on the side.  Find one that fits your needs and where the price is right and go with that.  FWIW, I have a Crestliner and have been very happy with it, but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase some of the other brands I've listed either.  Good luck."
591945,dave524,2011-06-11 11:55:00,4508,"While I have no report on these as far a quality and durability, as a Great lakes troller I think these are probably the best design I have seen, will fish like a boat longer than the actual length, integrated toe holds along the gunwales  , now why didn't some else come up wth that one long ago  The 17 footer looks awesome for its size  http://www.americananglerboats.com/boat-models.php?model=Osprey+162-172"
591946,bushart,2011-06-11 11:56:00,2628,I have a Smokercraft pro Tiller  It's caught so many fish there's a wanted poster of it in the post office  Or is it the operator  Lund does make a very nice boat---but late 90's versions livewell systems were not as good as my Smokercraft---And I fished and witnessed this for myself out of many lunds which was the alum boat of choice in the north
591947,fishnsled,2011-06-11 12:00:00,3520, x2 Find a boat design & layout that you are happy with and get it. If you are looking to flip it in a few years then resale value might be important to you as well. Good Luck.
591963,Tybo,2011-06-11 13:40:00,1373,LUND!!!!!
591966,lew,2011-06-11 14:03:00,12766,"The question about what boat should I buy, or motor, or truck or whatever comes up very frequentely around here and for the most part guys will say that what their using at the present time is the best there is, but 2 years from now when their using something different, that now becomes the best on the market.  Sorta like the TV hosts and their sponsors"
591977,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-11 15:31:00,10439,If you want a bullet proof aluminum boat you won't be able to beat a Hewescraft IMHO. They are everywhere out West and on the coast. They make everything from small lake and river boats to large ocean boats. Here are their small 16 to 20 footers.  Hewescraft
592019,Mike the Pike,2011-06-11 19:44:00,3421,Lund  
592053,Banger68,2011-06-11 22:10:00,157,"I bought an 18"" Sylvan last year and have been very happy with it. I was very impressed with it's rough water handling and I can get into the mid 40's with a 115 opti. I picked the Sylvan more for the interior layout then anything else as well as a proven hull construction.  It depends what is important to you to pick what suits you."
592058,buckster,2011-06-11 22:30:00,530,"Lund,princecraft,crestliner... Can't go wrong with either of the 3.   All depends on personal preference, i've had a starcraft for 11 years and still good as new!  No matter what you buy someone out there has had a bad experience with it!"
592586,Nipfisher,2011-06-13 19:14:00,2449,Another vote for Starcraft. I PMd you.
