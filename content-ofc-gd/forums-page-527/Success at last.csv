I found a nice spot where the river was running hard on the far bank but there was a nice little bay and slower running water on the near bank.  On Saturday afternoon I spent about 3 hours and float fished hard on the bottom, I had 3 carp between 8 and 14 lbs and a couple of fish which I'm not sure what they are but they had the same coloring as Carp but where smaller, thinner with a funny shaped head and an underslung mouth, maybe someone can tell me what they are.  On Sunday morning I returned to the same spot for about 4 hours and caught 4 carp between 6 and 9 lbs.  So all in all a very successful trip over a great weekend, none of the fish were monsters but all of the fish were very welcome, it felt so good to feel a bend in my rod again.  Colin.   "
592303,Roy,2011-06-12 22:56:00,13728,Great report and congrats on your success. The unknown fish might have been suckers.
592311,aplumma,2011-06-12 23:09:00,6896,Do we need to change your name to Carpfish 136 or will you get back to fishing for the worlds greatest fish the Catfish.   Looks like it was a good time had and as Roy said it most likely was Suckers.   Art
592315,Colin Marshall,2011-06-12 23:16:00,66," Hi Roy,  Many thanks for the kind words and for the fish recognition, at least I know what they are now and they remind me of a fish I used to catch in Europe which was called Barbel.  Tight lines.  Colin."
592316,Colin Marshall,2011-06-12 23:18:00,66," Hi Art,  Nah I'll stick with Catfish thanks........ and it was nice to catch a few fish.  Colin."
592329,NAW,2011-06-12 23:44:00,4022,I'm glad you finally caught some fish in Ontario.  I'm sure there will be many many more to come.  Thanks for sharing!
