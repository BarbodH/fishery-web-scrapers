Had to work hard to get em, and managed to land about 6 in the 19-25"" range as well as a couple eaters. Most productive in the Shawanaga River. Tough weekend, but better than working as the saying goes and I will still have a fish fry when I get home. Enjoy the pic, did not take too many photos unfortunately.-skdds "

Eyes are usually hanging in about 11-15ft all over up there. Mid summer behind Bonnie can be amazing, but can come up dry too. That's the best part of P.A.B. Its one of the hardest places to fish. I wouldn't choose any other place. Its becoming over fished though now."

Forget what year it was when I hooked that up live, but about 20 years ago when Leah and I headed to Manitoulin in the Tempest.  A nice fish there fella and a wonderful meal I'm sure!"
