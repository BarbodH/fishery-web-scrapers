592091,JeffBornFishin,2011-06-12 00:08:00,260,"Well today was the day I had been waiting for.  After a really early start we were off into a beautiful morning despite the weather forecasts. They are always right      It wasn't long and the first fish hooked up.    Then a nice bow.    It slowed down for a while. Those that have been out with Lloyd know he works his tail off to cover water/change patterns/setups to get you on the fish.  While waiting, some commercial traffic steamed past.    Not long after the action heated up again. Missed two and in the madness this beauty came along.    This made my day.  Scratch another one off the bucket list  For those that couldn't commit to coming today you sure missed a great trip!  Thanks again Lloyd for a great day!"
592093,dhickey,2011-06-12 00:15:00,1038,WOW Nice fish!!!  So ultralite is no good out there?  
592094,Terry,2011-06-12 00:16:00,14456,you can't go wrong with Lloyd always a good time
592099,Joey,2011-06-12 00:31:00,9122,"Looks like it was a great day out there.  Lloyd is a great guide and you're right, he works his tail off"
592101,glen,2011-06-12 00:32:00,2641,Wow that's a big one.  I am not sure if i would eat a lot of fish from Lake O.  Do you guys keep all of those fish or just a few or what?
592105,JeffBornFishin,2011-06-12 00:42:00,260, Survivors were all realeased.  The fish in the first pic was delicious  There is absolutly no problem with eating sportfish from any lake as long as you follow the guide:  Guide to eating sport fish
592146,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-12 02:57:00,2690,Some really nice bows!!!  Once again Lloyd delivers
592155,irishfield,2011-06-12 03:54:00,26272,"Great stuff Jeff... a real kick in the nuts that nobody could join you out there, but I'll tell you that there isn't much better than a day on the water with Lloyd alone, no better company... well maybe other than Terry, or Dano, or Roy, or Spiel, or Lew.. or............ LMAO !"
592199,mercman,2011-06-12 14:06:00,7054,Great looking fish !! What an awesome day of fishing you guys had.  Cheers Paul  
592200,fishnsled,2011-06-12 14:11:00,3520,Always a good time with Lloyd.  Some beauty fish there Jeff.
592234,Leecher,2011-06-12 18:05:00,7832,That's awesome Jeff   Congrats on that monster bow
592236,Roy,2011-06-12 18:17:00,13728,"Good stuff, Jeff. I've only been out once on Lloyd's boat but I'll get out there again for sure."
592336,alphaalpha,2011-06-13 00:01:00,475,"nice! I would have loved to come but had plans long ago for this weekend.  Great to see some fish being pulled in on the east side for a change.  On other websites it's still mostly a west-end/south shore bite due to the long cold crappy spring we've had.  Can't wait for some kings to start coming around to play!   Thanks for the report,  -AA."
