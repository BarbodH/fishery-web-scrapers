592549,Fang,2011-06-13 16:47:00,1330,My biggest carp ever came this way. 1/8 oz jig tipped with a leech off Rams Island in Hay Bay. It was long weekend in May and I was sure I had the biggest Quinte walleye ever. Never saw it for the fisrct 5 mio nutes or so. Took over 15 minutes to finally come in on 6lb test and I didn't have a net big enough. Never got a tape or scale on it cause I couldn't get it in the boat but I'd say in the 25 - 30 lb range  Had another similar instance when I hooked a 15 lb sheephead in the niagara. Saw a quick flash of silver down deep and figured I had a monster bow on but knew something was wrong as all it did was sound back down to the bottom. Still an awesome fight I won't forget in both cases.

I was dissapointed... but good fight though, on 10ft rod 6lb line...  he was 27"" long.."
