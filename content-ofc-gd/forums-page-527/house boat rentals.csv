591231,Hud,2011-06-09 00:01:00,140,looking at getting away for a few days and was thinking about renting a houseboat near pigeon.  Never spent much time on one and just looking to see if anyone has had any good experiences renting.  thought it might be a good way to spend a long weekend.  any tips on things to be on the look out for etc would be appreciated. thanks!

Would recommend longer (week) so you get the full effect. -In this water system, most of the shoreline seems to be privately owned - we were actually kicked off an anchorage at 6:30 in the am by NIMBIES - most of your nights are spent at marinas or dedicated spots by the locks. That being said, cruising the Trent is a good experience.  -If you can get a boat, would recommend Temagami, as lots of water for cruising without locks, shorelines are largely crown land. Tieing up on the large island on the 'hub' of the lakes in site of Ketchunanny lodge gives you nice walking trails, a 'walk to' lodge for fishing supplies, or if you've got a tow along boat, ready access to a lodge with ice cream just across the channel. If this place is your plan, create a few official looking signs saying ""canoe camping closed for site regeneration"" with the MNR crest and staple to trees.   This will keep canoeists from coming to beg a cup of coffee, drying their clothes, use of your sat phone etc. Cruel but it's for their own good - they chose the wilderness thing - don't tempt them otherwise. Kind of like not feeding wild animals.  -Frankly, would be researching this well ahead of time. The 'Ports' book on the Trent/Severn is a good resource, usually found at marine supply places, and there is a lock by lock guide on the internet that is also a good resource. Found it:  http://www.cruising.ca/trent/2-index.html#2021  For those with nothing better to do you can cruise the Trent while at work! You can also copy and paste each page to your computer and provided all are in the same folder, get the same link effect while running off a CD."

Then around 7 years ago we rented from Egan Houseboats....it was OK but the fridge didn't work...the maintenance guy kept following us around the lakes trying to fix it...at one point they even replaced the fridge as we were tied up at the locks in Fenlen Falls.  They never did get it right and we had to buy a TON of ice to keep our food cold...in the end they took off the price of 3 days for our inconvience...  If I do it again and we are talking about it we would try Happy Days Houseboat rentals this time.... just wish Three Buoys Marina didn't go out of business...they had everything in ship shape.  But here are two of the houseboat rentals that are on Pigeon Lake... http://www.happydayshouseboats.com/marina.htm http://www.houseboat.on.ca/  BTW in the 2 weeks of houseboating in the Kawarthan's we never had any trouble tying up for the night at the locks or anchoring in a bay....LOTS of open water back bays without dealing with private property owners.  Good Luck and you will have a BLAST if you do rent one, Bob"

591345,smally21,2011-06-09 11:54:00,993,"make sure to smash into every other boat in the lock while traversing the severn, you wouldn't get the full houseboat' feeling without causing some sideways havoc around other boats..."

591577,blue pickeral,2011-06-10 09:12:00,267," LOL...on a trip for our wedding anniversary and still vividly remember this harridan in a flaming orange house coat and a voice like a chain saw on the end of a dock waving her arms and screaming at us...just wanted to get the idea across that you can't just anchor/tie up anywhere.  There is also an outfit that rents around Kingston way and the 1000 Islands on the St. Lawrence. Haven't been there yet, but the park is supposed to provide many scenic anchorages. Maybe someone else has done this area and can provide some feedback."
592444,Jer,2011-06-13 10:39:00,1426,"Though I haven't rented a houseboat personally, in speaking to many that have, I would recommend not trying to travel too far on your trip, avoid the canals and as many locks as possible. There's enough water just on the Tri-Lakes to keep you entertained for week. Bring a small fishing boat to tow along and you're set."
