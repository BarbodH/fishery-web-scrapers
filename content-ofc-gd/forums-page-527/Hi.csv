Didn't want to hijack that one, so I am just trying follow some etiquette and introduce myself.  I live in the London area, just north and outside of the city. Love to fish, have my own boat (1997 Legend Sportfish, 90HP 2-stroke Mariner). It's a passion, but not really very experienced, and don't get out nearly often enough. I try to get out in the area (mostly St. Clair and smaller inland lakes) targeting bass, pike, walleye and muskie (only ever caught one small one), and rent a cottage every summer and good fishing is a prerequistite for that.  I have been reading this board with great interest, seems like a really great bunch of guys. I will start to contribute if I have anything meaningful to say.  Thanks for listening. If I can ever help out with anything in this area, I will, and hopefully I can start to ask for your input too.  And yes, I understand everyone loves the photos. I promise to start posting."
