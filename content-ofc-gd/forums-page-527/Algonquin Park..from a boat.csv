My son is excited to get out on the boat!  I know there are a few lakes (opeongo, rock, smoke and lake of two rivers) that do allow motors. Could someone give any recomendations? Id like:  1. Best lake to go for a 2 - 3 hour pleasure cruise ...and why  2. Best lake to get a few bass and/or panfish for the little guy. Since we will likely only get out for 3-4 hours, specifics would be great...   Thanks all.."
592351,irishfield,2011-06-13 00:45:00,26272,Lake of Two Rivers is a nice campground and has a nice sand beach for him to swim. Also where I launched my porta-bote years back. If I remember correctly I caught a few bass along the South shoreline. Not a huge lake... but perfect for a safe 2 or 3 hour troll around it's perimeter with the lad.

592362,atvaholic,2011-06-13 00:58:00,271, Thanks solo..I just did some research as I have never heard of this lake! looks like a great place to try next time as I have never been on that side of the park. Its a bit too far for this one though as we are staying at cabbisbay.
