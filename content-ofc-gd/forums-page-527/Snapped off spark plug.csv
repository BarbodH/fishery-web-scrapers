592216,cuzza,2011-06-12 15:46:00,467,This stuff might do the job http://www.loctitefreezeandrelease.com/ it might seperate everything enough that the expansion of the EZ-out won`t matter. Alternatively - can you get a big Torx socket and hammer it in first then freeze it?  Sorry - for some reason I couldn't see pages 2 and 3

592282,irishfield,2011-06-12 22:21:00,26272,"LOL Chris... only one cut on my right hand!  Another long day... prior to working on getting the plug out, it would start on 2 cylinders. After all the welding on the exhaust yesterday I couldn't get it to start today and figured maybe the condensor finally packed it in as am definitely fighting a spark issue as well. Thought for giggles I'd do a compression test on the old beast... center cyl 95 psi.. front 32.. rear ZERO ! DANG.. did I burn a hole in the piston.. couldn't have as it was pumping air when I cranked it to blow any last crap out yesterday.  I looked in with a flash light today and saw what I though was melted aluminum... DAMN I did burn a hole in it, but no it can't be.. no way. Compression test again... ZERO..HMMMM. So I'm thinking.. maybe I did burn a small hole in the piston and just can't see it, so I put a 1/4 quart of oil in on top of the piston to see if it would drain thru into the case. It did not. So now I'm thinking the only way to get ZERO is a valve must be stuck open, so I vacuumed out the oil and took the rocker cover off and I find the exhaust push rod sitting beside the rocker arm. How did that happen??.... I guess while welding the exhaust enough slag went in the exhaust port and collected on an open valve face and this was what I saw reflecting off the piston top when I shawn the light in that looked like melted alum. So the valve stayed open.. and the push rod fell out of the rocker. Got it all fixed up and still had ZERO. Gave the valve a few wacks and it crumbled what ever was left in there and I suddenly had 95psi on that one toooo !!   More investigating and I found no clearance on the front exhaust rocker arm. Once I backed that off and gave it a little lash the front cylinder jumped from 32 to 95 as well !    Amazed that valve hasn't burnt right off... with it sitting open a tad for all these years. Exhaust all welded up, new muffler installed that I've had sitting in the shop for a decade and it purrs!  Only question remains is why I'm doing this just so my son can use it. It's never ran this good in all the time I've owned it (since 1995!). Oh yah, at 28 years old... I'm tired of excuses as to why he hasn't started his house build next door.....   Hard for a guy like me to understand, as I left home at 17 and was on his 3rd home by that age."

A broken bit is enough headaches. There is a guy in the hammer that specializes in this. And he is good at it. He has warned what not to do, just in case. And what to do. If it was not an engine block or a cylindar head, I would say go for it. Damaging the threads in any manner could cause a plug bow out or a compression leak.   "
591839,spinnerdoc,2011-06-11 00:35:00,556,Have you tried heating the plug red hot then spraying wd 40 at it to cool it down rapidly and to penetrate into the threads? This is a trick that works like a charm at our shop when it comes to taking ceased up bolts.

591883,dhickey,2011-06-11 02:49:00,1038,Hears what I do. get a torques key 1/16 smaller than the outside diameter of the siezed bolt.(aprox +/-) Drill a pilot hole as close to centre as posible without going through the plug(you know best) Then drill a hole 1/16 smaller than the closest thread on the head(should be about 3/8) dont go through. Taper the torques just enough to make the pionts look like wedges. Heat the plug to the piont it becomes soft(malluable). Then quickly drive the torques into the plug DO NOT REMOVE!!! (heavy hammer 5 to 8 hits you will know best) Put tapping fluid on it Go have lunch .(cool down) It should spin out without doing any damage to the threads.  Hope this helps. Problems like this outside the shop are trying at times. Good luck.

591906,mrpike,2011-06-11 04:10:00,151,Lot's of heat and  use your EZ-OUT . Just make sure its really hot you may only get one shot at it. And make sure you got the EZ- OUT in good before you give it a turn.   GOOD LUCK WAYNE.    O and vacum out after you get it out .
591909,OhioFisherman,2011-06-11 04:32:00,6623,"Looks like a project to me, the last time I fooled around with a broken bolt I drilled a hole in it and took a 1/8 carbide cutter and put it in a dremel and cut almost to the threads in a few spots, then put a took a tap and started it in the hole and the bolt fell apart.  You don`t have a lot of room to work there though, and given your location no idea how hard it is for you to find carbide cutters in unusual shapes or lengths.  Cast iron cylinder head? excessive heating or cooling could cause more problems? cracking? and assuming the piston is aluminum?  Duct tape over the end of a vacuum hose and push a small diameter plastic hose through should allow you to clean out metal chips or filings? and since you have a bore scope? You could also use a thin piece of metal like a brake line to blow air into the spark plug hole to suspend any chips and vacuum at the same time to remove them? A small magnet might also work on suspended chips?  Good luck Wayne!"

591936,skinny,2011-06-11 11:20:00,442,here is a trick I have used many times on old Volkswagens all you need is heat a candle and prob in your case a easy out. heat it up and run the candle around where the thrads match. this will wick the wax into the thread. Then you need a method to turn the plug protion out be it a easy out gently taped in as to not expand it or tap the out side with a chisel. might sound od but I have used this method several times with great luck.  Tobad we are not closer I have the Left drill bit too and extra long easy outs also a long helicoil install kit for spark plugs (got it to do VW's without pulling tin off
591944,fishnsled,2011-06-11 11:50:00,3520, Never had to pull a broken spark plug before but almost think I could now. Yep best fishing forum on the net. Lots of knowledge here.    And some not so useful help but funny as all hell.  Good one Randy    Most likely is Brian but perhaps a longer soak was decided upon. That way he could sneak in a couple of hours of fishing first. I hope that is what happened.
591961,Tybo,2011-06-11 13:29:00,1373,HEAT WRENCH AND TAPERED EASY OUT. you already have the hole threw the threads.heat just the threads.Since it can't expand it will contract on it's self. I have taken out way more with a torch then  having to drill. Use this way to take out broken bolts and inner races. Use liquid wrench.It's non-flameble.

Don't need another day like that.. half of it pouring rain while I worked on the damn thing. My own fault... don't let your machinery sit idle, it does it no favours.  Well I used almost everyones suggestions... even Randy's although the Seafoam went in the tank to hopfully clean up a leaking carb float needle.  Penetrant soak over night... torched it to glow red... put my EZ-out in it and if I turned it any harder I knew that EZ-out would shatter. Heated it again... and tried the quick cool with Liquid Wrench. EZ-out.. same deal.  Put my thinking cap on.. no fun working down a 3+ inch recess. Since the neutral tip was still in place I took part of a cotton ball and pushed it tight to the tip to seal the remainder of the plug. Drilled about 1/2 the wall thickness away almost to the very end and the cotton ball kept all the chips out of the cylinder. Remove cotton ball... heat again and tried the EZ-out again... NO JOY  Went for broke... drilled to 7/16ths... 15/32 would have been right to the thread roots. Heated it again.. hit it with Liquid Wrench.. hammered the EZ-out in and it came out so easy that I thought the EZ-out was just spinning.  Vacuumed out with a 3/8 tube.. borescope and then cranked over so it could blow anything out I missed.  Got a new set of plugs from CTC... match what came out anyhow.. NGK V - power GR4 Good thing they sell them in pairs at CTC and that I have a spark plug cleaner / tester. Only 3 plugs good out of 4... good thing it's a 3 cylinder!  Spent from 3pm to 7pm building up weld beads to fill all the rust out holes in the exhaust manifold. If anyone's worked on these things the intake and exhaust manifold is a combo.. and they rot out because people don't throw a can over the exhaust outlet to keep the rain out.  Still not done with it... has a point/condenser issue making it tempermental. Now to find a point set for a 3 cyl gas.....

Working on getting my JD350 dozer going so my son can grade his lot and of course the one plug (out of 3) that wasn't firing was seized in place. Couldn't turn it with a 3/8 ratchet.. so of course I hit it with the 1/2"" and broke it off. Looks like about 1/2 inch of thread section left in the head.  I've sprayed some penetrating oil at it... and thought I'd come here and ask the mechanics what their plan of attach would be!

591802,Bernie,2011-06-10 23:19:00,3190,"There appears to be a lot of material on the wall of that plug Wayne. I think I would apply some penetrating fluid on it, let it soak in for a day or two. I might hit it with the torch to break the thread rust-locked to the block. Then use an easy out. I like the Snap-on tapered easy outs for spark plugs. Haven't had one yet I couldn't get out."

591808,Bernie,2011-06-10 23:27:00,3190,If you need to drill (sometimes we need to) Put it at the top on compression stroke. We made an adapter that fits on the end of a vacuum cleaner that reduces it to a thin wall hose that fits into the cylinder and vacuum it out. Then we verify we got it all with a borescope.
591809,irishfield,2011-06-10 23:29:00,26272,Okay thanks Bernie.. I have a flexible borescope!
591810,vinnimon,2011-06-10 23:30:00,2593,"  Ive been there before , but you have easy access to it. You will need a left hand drill bit, one that cuts in reverse for starters( one thats about 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch smaller than the max diameter of the plug) . A shop vac, and reduce the hose end to reach inside the cylindar bore. You already have a guide at the plug. A thin magnet. A can of Liquid Torch. A very good small sharp pointed chisel and a small hammer( just in case). Ive been lucky on a few cat. detroit 55 and 60 series, cummins and volvo engines with the same issue, except they were fuel line fittings seized in the head. Most times the heat generated from the left hand bit frees them up As for easy outs, I find most of them expands what your trying to free up. Snap on has the best Ive used.If it moves then use the easy out. Just my 1.9238 american cents worth."
591811,SBCregal,2011-06-10 23:31:00,688,putting grease on the drillbit helps with trapping the shavings as well

591814,JeffBornFishin,2011-06-10 23:36:00,260," Here's an old school trick. Put the problem cylinder at bottom dead centre. Next take some small diameter hemp rope or equivelant and fill the cylinder with it to the base if the plug hole after soaking the rope in water. Now you have two options. Carefully drill the thing out and now you don't have to worry about cuttings going into the cylinder. If that's a no go heat the broken portion with oxy/aceteyne. Once its nice and hot use a wide blade heavy duty slotted screwdriver, chisel or eazy out with plenty of non flammable liquid wrench. Then carefully try removing the stubborn broken off plug.  You get better results if drill the bulk of the broken off piece out first then try heating/removing the leftover. It will tend to split and come apart easier.  The rope keeps crap from getting into the cylinder. Once you get the stubborn piece out, take a shop vac and put it over the hole and draw out the rope.  Don't worry about damaging the threads in the head too much, a heli-coil kit works wonders."
591815,Bernie,2011-06-10 23:36:00,3190,Sometimes if it's accessible with a die grinder I use a small bit and cut a slot almost to the block threads. This will reduce the pressure of the plug thread to the outside. This also allows the use of the easy outs.
591816,irishfield,2011-06-10 23:38:00,26272,Thanks everyone... I'm gonna have an El Dorado Silver Deluxe or three ... and get on it in the morning!

591823,aplumma,2011-06-10 23:45:00,6896,Just had to do this one on a bolt. Soak it with a light lube and then a 1/4 extention chucked up in a hammer drill. Run it in reverse for the vibration factor for a few minutes a few times. Wash off with brake cleaner to remove the oil then try to see if you can stick weld an piece of square stock on the top of the plug base. Vacuum any spatter and re apply the oil  then put the square stock into a socket and use the hammer/hand impact extractor.  Don't mess with it till Saturday so it has time to soak.   Art
591826,PERCHER,2011-06-10 23:54:00,787,If you have the room take a mig welder and weld a bolt to it>then heat the plug and remove it with a socket. Just an idea. Dan
