When we arrived at the launch (8:30) there were people pulling out because it was too windy and the wind was blowing in the same direction as the current, which makes for some very tough fishing in the river.  I had been pumping the kids up all week, no turning back now. We ended up in a few ""calm"" spots that I knew and caught tons of fish, the kids had a blast.  It was another multi species day on the river. Silver bass - too many to count, 35 would be a good guess Walleye - 1 Small mouth - 2 Large mouth - 4 Goby - 1  There is nothing like the look on a 9 yr olds face and the sound of ""I have one, I have one, fish on"", hopefully next time the wind is down a bit so we can reach 100! Overall a fantastic day on the water.  Sorry team 2, nothing tournament worthy."
