Despite a little wind and waves the fishing was still very good. This yr is the first time in my 12 yrs of fishing this event not have a 30"" walleye come to the scales. My team consisted of a father and son from London, Bill and Zac and a tournament part Mark Lemke. We boated about 30 walleyes releasing the larger ones 5-7lbers and keeping the 3-4lbers. We did keep a 29.25"" walleye that we felt would be a top ten fish and fortunatley for us we placed 3rd. The derby is the second weekend of June and has numerous door prizes with the top fish winning $1500 for a $20 entry. This is the largest single one day derby in Ont drawing well over 300 entries each yr.  http://derby.hcslions.com/  "
