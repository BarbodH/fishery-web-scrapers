592604,Cookslav,2011-06-13 20:22:00,1457,"I've been free smoke free for 11 years this September  The trick for me was cold Turkey, and Anger LOL!!! I know that sounds horrible, but Anger can be a great tool when pointed in the right Direction.  I was simply MAD at the addiction... Every time I tried to quit and I gave in...I got mad. Mad at myself, and mad at the dam cigarettes.  The spin that finally worked was when I looked at myself in the mirror and told myself. "" I guess you are not stong enough to beat this...""  And it was at this moment I became pretty much ENRAGED that I couldn't beat it... I do things my way, and NOBODY tells me what to do so why was I letting a cigarette do that?  I dropped my pack in the garbage, and never looked back. Everytime I felt the urge...I got mad, and I don't get mad I get even!!! I got even by beating it, and by saving my hard earned cash.  I have said it before to many, and I'll say it again...if you truely want to quit you will. I found cold turkey the best because it wasn't comfortable. I had to work at it, and feel the pain so to speak....the suffering inspired me and pushed me along. And earning it made it SOOOO mush easier to stay away.  After 3 months of Physicall sickenss, 6 months of frayed nerves, 12 months of cravings, and 2 years of working off the added pounds...there was NO WAY I was going to do that all over again LOL!!!  Just think about it like a Back lake adventure....you know your going to have to hump it up hill, through bogs, around rocks, and through thick bush with all 60lbs of gear, and your canoe. You muscles are gonna burn, your gonna be scraped, sweaty, dirty, and eaten alive by the bugs....but when you get there you know the payback its gonna be a gorgeous photo of you and your new PB Brookie.  Good Luck & Hang in there Simon, its a tough go...but a tough guy like you should be able to make it."
592609,limeyangler,2011-06-13 20:38:00,5204," LOL...only you would be so bold Paul!    Thanks JD....its going good.    CONGRATS ON 11 YEARS  Lol...i've done the Brookie thing 4 times now and never caught one....i've all but given up!  I'll hit cold turkey in about 9 weeks, i'm just giving myself that time on the patches to get used to not smoking, i'll be fine.  I went cold turkey on Saturday, in the excitement of going fishing i forgot to put my patch on in the morning...i felt like crap all day but did not realise it till 5:30pm. So the patch is not a placebo effect!"
591098,irishfield,2011-06-08 18:46:00,26272, I always believed in tough love Simon!!
591100,limeyangler,2011-06-08 18:50:00,5204," Me too wayne...if it was not for 'tough Love"" when i was fighting with other addictions in my life i would have been dead long ago. Its a shame that the concept is out of favour in the climate of political correctness we live in today."
591104,Squid,2011-06-08 19:03:00,1656,All of the gimmicks for quitting smoking put Nicotine into your body. So you become addicted to the patches etc. Champix on the other hand blocks the nicotine receptors in the brain. It is covered on most company insurance plans so there is no cost to you. You will experience wildly vivid dreams and nausea for the first 2 weeks but after that it is smooth sailing. You have to stay on them for 3 months in order for all of the nicotine to flush out of your body. It worked for me too and it’s been 3 ½ years of no smoking for me. No cravings to boot!!
591108,fishnsled,2011-06-08 19:13:00,3520,Good luck Simon!! You can do this!
591114,bubbles,2011-06-08 19:28:00,591,"I am on year 3 (I think) I don't even think about it anymore, first few months are tough.  Think how much more fishing time you will have with Jack, that should get you through!"
591221,spincast,2011-06-08 23:13:00,3279,"Good on ya Simon. Well worth the effort, and your family will thank you for the rest of your life. The first week is the physical part - after that its all in the head - and if you beat the bottle this will be a breeze (of fresh air) - kicked a 2 pack a day habit."
591334,Fishnwire,2011-06-09 10:41:00,983,"Here is something to keep in mind...  If you've got a couple of days or more in without having a smoke, and you are tempted to have ""just one""...that cigarette is going to taste like crap and you'll feel a little woozy after it.  Basically, it's totally not worth it.  Afterwards (trust me) you'll just be sitting there thinking, ""What a waste.  I ruined my streak and didn't even enjoy the cigarette."""

591351,Old Man,2011-06-09 12:27:00,822,"Hang in there Simon. My wife and I quit 15 years ago when the doctor told her she need to quit or she'd be carrying and oxygen bottle in 10 years time. We used the patch and it definitely helped. Every time you get a craving, just think of Jack. If not for yourself, he's the best reason to quit."
591352,Harrison,2011-06-09 12:30:00,2202,"Here is a little poem that seems to hit home with a lot of folks fighting addictions.    Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow  There are two days in every week that we should not worry about, two days that should be kept free from fear and apprehension.  One is yesterday, with its mistakes and cares, its faults and blunders, its aches and pains. Yesterday has passed, forever beyond our control.  All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday. We cannot undo a single act we performed. Nor can we erase a single word we've said - yesterday is gone!  The other day we shouldn't worry about is tomorrow, with its impossible adversaries, its burden, its hopeful promise and poor performance. Tomorrow is beyond our control.  Tomorrow's sun will rise either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds - but it will rise. And until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.  This leaves only one day - today. Any person can fight the battles of just one day. It is only when we add the burdens of yesterday and tomorrow that we break down.  It is not the experience of today that drives people mad - it is the remorse of bitterness for something which happened yesterday, and the dread of what tomorrow may bring.  Let us, therefore, live one day at a time!  Author Unknown"
591421,limeyangler,2011-06-09 17:41:00,5204," Ok....i think its unfair to label those products as ""gimmicks"" as they have helped a lot of people quit. I am fully aware that i am not ""nicotine free"" at this point and am probably ingesting more nicotine daily than i might have done on some days when i was smoking. However, i chose this method after careful consideration. i know from beating other addictions in my life that reducing gradually works...FOR ME...  I like what i hear about Champix...but even Champix does not work for some people. But as i've stated before...Champix sounds like a pretty good plan 'B' for me and i appreciate all the insight you share about your experience     Thanks dood....i'm gonna give it 1000001%    Will do Bubbles...thanks man.  Not only will i get more time fishing....i can afford it too!!!!    Awesome spincast....i'm in awe...and all these success stories harden my resolve to do this.  Thanks for your support.    Thats exactly what i think. No way i'm gonna have just one,,,i know where it leads. I know how my addicted thought patterns work too...if i justify one i can justify more.    Thanks man....i'll check it out....jeeeze...i'm sweating already just thinking about exercise.  But her we are again...another success story....congrats daplumma...good job    Where the hell ya been buddy? have you been out for Bass yet?  Anyway thanks for the encouragement Gord, it will be a pleasure not to have to step outside of your Frabill this winter  or poison you in mine!  The Crappie should be in in Mile and trap...i aint got out as much this year...fancy a trip out soon?  Once again...thanks for your support.   :thumbsup_anim:  Thanks for taking the time to post that Harrison....this is helpful to everyone...not just the   hopelessly addicted"
591423,manitoubass2,2011-06-09 17:52:00,11391,"Just a few thoughts Limey, no idea if this helps or hurts, I guess it depends on how you view it?  Nicotine is not nearly as addictive as many people believe, and in fact, it can be a useful chemical at times. Using chemicals and smoke as a delivery method however is very harmful to ones health. For this reason, nicotine patches can be a great idea to help you quit ""smoking tobacco"".  The ""Act"" of smoking is probably more addictive than the actually nicotine, thus referred to often as a habit, not a drug dependancy. a good example is to think ""what would I do for a cig right now? Would you steal from your wife/child/mother"". I sincerely hope the answer is no, and as long as it is, shows a difference between nicotine and other chemically mind altering compounds.  The ""Act"" of smoking is similar to alcohol in a way. It's a risk/reward type of compound, and this aspect of the drug in question is fairly easy to break. But it will be the toughest part of this ""habit"" to kick.  Simply reward yourself in other ways, and develope new, healthy ""habits"", just like you probably unintentionally did after quitting alcohol use.  Anyhow, lol enough blabbering"
591425,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-09 18:00:00,0,Addiction sucks. Having an addictive personality sucks even more.  Good luck with that...Have ya started yet?   I love all the non addict comments...They should have a seat at a meeting sometime....
591430,manitoubass2,2011-06-09 18:18:00,11391," lol, these ""meetings"" sound interesting.  My point, from an addictive standpoint, the drug nicotine is fairly weak.  Whether you quit or not, will depend on your mind frame and the decisions you make.  Want to quit, quit. Will it be tough, maybe? It's different for everyone.  But honestly, just don't question your resolve, stick by it. You'll be just fine"
591512,Dave Bailey,2011-06-10 00:35:00,1641,If all else fails this should help you quit:  Q - What's the worst thing about getting a lung transplant?  A - Every time you cough you get a mouthful of someone else's phlegm.  
591517,Rod Caster,2011-06-10 00:54:00,5784," I think you just helped 4 or 5 people quit with that one joke.  haha good one, but gross."
591668,GreenCanada,2011-06-10 16:17:00,375,"I quit a couple years ago, though I'm still only in my late twenties. What worked for me was reminding myself how bad the smell of old stale cigarette smoke was on a few people I had passed while walking down the street one day. The thought of never wanting to smell like that is what kept my motivation up. I feel you have to go cold turkey and be away somewhere that smokes are not available. If you can manage a few days without any, you will find that it is really easy to CHOOSE not to buy more. It takes some dedication, but if you are quitting for yourself and not for someone else, you will kick the habit.  I wish you the best, and as other members have said, imagine how much fishing stuff you can buy with that cash!!!  :D"

590802,rufus,2011-06-08 01:06:00,267,I quit before the patch was invented. The only way I could do it was cold turkey. I ate sunflower seeds non stop for months and when my mouth got sore I would chew gum. Sunflower seeds are highly recommended but may drive your wife crazy

LOL...funny enough i work in a substance misuse detox centre.....i say all this stuff to my clients everyday....its not so easy when the shoe is on the other foot.    Thanks Geoff....i'm gonna do it.    I hope i find it easy...lol...that would be awesome!    I agree to a certain degree Maureen. However i dont think i really wanted to quit...kinda done for my wife and boy Jack....not to mention the finaciaL side to it. However, i never intended quitting drinking either...i booked into a rehab to avoid the law.....but about 2 weeks into the programme something clicked....so sometimes you just have to drag the horse to water, hold its head under for a while and see what happens    Its weird bfisher, jack has never said anything about my smoking...until this morning...the morning i make a decision to quit....coincidence?    LOL...you are kidding right....its toooooo stressful trying to get an appointment to see a doctor..hell....we dont even have a doctor. But...good advice...thanks.   Cancer scares the crap outta me Wayne....and to think i increase the risks of jack and mum losing me that way is just not on anymore."
590809,Grimace,2011-06-08 01:13:00,2020,"I quit Feb 6th 2010.  16 months.  Champix was a big help and the dreams were killer.  I went from 2 1/2 packs a day to nothing and I feel great.  I made a doctors appointment, he checked me and followed up.  You really don't know how crappy you feel until after you quit for a good while because then you feel great and could not imagine feeling that crappy again."
590810,irishfield,2011-06-08 01:13:00,26272,  GOOD... don't leave Jack high and dry like my old man did to me when I was 24 ! Give that some thought and those cravings should go away...

The things you associate having a cigarette with........coffee, after dinner, out in the boat. You will need to change habits and find something to take the place of the smoke.  You have a PM  Much luck and courage..."

I started at 15 stopped at 19 started again 3 years ago smoked on and off since then best thing is to quit cold turkey and pick up sports stay away from them cancer sticks , the money you spend on cigarettes every week stash it aside for 1 year im sure you'll have a good sum of $$$$$$$$$$ Good luck and don't give in.  cheers shadowFly"
590865,toca,2011-06-08 02:16:00,274," i still hang around with people who still smoke. to tell you the truth i honestly dont think about grabbing them and lighting up. I tried once after a month and was so turned off with the taste, swollen throat and stuffy nose.  cold turkey could be a bad thing as well. nicotine is a drug that is very addictive. some people who go cold turkey who goes back to smoking find themself sometimes smoking more. I Just slowly weened myself off with a little bit of help and even thought it feels like ive stopped smoking for a year its only been april 2011 I officially stopped.  just find your groove and you can kick this habit.  cheers, Ted"
590871,mercman,2011-06-08 02:31:00,7054,"Simon, Please keep me posted as to your progress. Like you i quit the booze 21 years ago, but the smokes are deadly addictive, and i was unsuccessful quitting a few months ago. I could use a bit of support to help me try again and maybe stick with it this time. Good luck Paul"
590872,lunkerbasshunter,2011-06-08 02:33:00,2585,you can do it!!  i quit about 6 and a half years ago cold turkey.  No help just will power.  It can be done im proof of it.  hang in there you can do this!!!!
590883,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-08 02:46:00,1107,Its been 3.5 years for me and it was champix that got me through it after a week or so you will notice how bad you smell when you smoke that was the biggest incentive for me can't believe how bad it makes people smell (sorry smokers but you stink LOL) good luck and stick with it.
590886,muskymike,2011-06-08 02:51:00,772,"Another vote for Champix if you need help. I stopped April 17, 2010. After 15 years of smoking, i have never felt better. Yes, you will put on weight, just like a few have before. I also know about 9 people that have quit with Alan Carr's book. And they all say the same thing, the book is amazing and works.  Here is the reality of it. For anyone who has smoked in the past will know, smoking is awesome. There are not many things that are better then it. I loved smoking. All parts of it. I still think I love it. The truth is its disgusting in more ways then we can ever imagine. Not to mention the detriment to your health.  Accept that it's amazing, know that you will miss it every day, and know, in the end, the benefits of quitting will out weight the benefits (so we all think) of smoking. Quitting smoking sucked. But it was soooo worth it. I will never smoke again. Its just not worth it. And yes, I still love smoking."
590888,toca,2011-06-08 02:53:00,274," I can see how breaking this habit CAN be really really hard but really its not. Alot of people think that these needs for smoking are just bad habits but people get confused with habits and addiction. Regardless of being unsuccessful you should have just stuck with it. In the month of march i think i ended up buying smokes and smoking everyday for three weeks before getting back on track. and in april i had a few slip heres and there and i pretty much learned how to say ""NO"" to friends and peers who offered(you know who you are). But Every Week It Got Easier And Easier. The BIG reward is the left over money i have saved from buying smokes and already i can buy a 14' trailer(second hand of course) with that money  Keep it up merc and limely"

Wife figured out how much money I saved and went out and bought me a very nice reel as a reward. Then she got herself a very nice reel.  As for the coffee, get some that has a better 'kick' than the normal stuff you're drinking while smoking...Starbucks extra extra bold...seemed to help."
590964,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-08 12:45:00,4399," Took me two turns at Champix as well, the first time when I failed I did not complete the program, the second time I did it exactly as instructed and never looked back. The weight gain is an issue I went from 185 to 215 and felt like crap the weight is sloooowly coming off but try and watch your eating habits to avoid the big weight gain. I wish there was a Champix for junk food!"
590994,manitoubass2,2011-06-08 13:59:00,11391,"As for the weight gain associated with quiting tobacco products, it's because nicotine is not only a stimulant but also exhibits strong nutrient partitioning effects(effects how calories and macronutrients are dealt with within the body).  A good dose of fish oil daily will help resolve that issue, and help you become healthier in many facets anyhow.  6 grams per day, in divided doses with food. This can be bought at a health food store, or Wal-Mart, for about $10/bottle. Look for a product that contains 1 gram per softgel, with 180mg EPA, and 120mg of DHA (should be easy, this is the normal numbers for most products)"

Thanks Shadowfly...i'm no David Beckham but i love playing soccer. * years ago i would play 3 times a week, but i found it less enjoyable as my age and fitness(smoking and running for 90 minutes dont work) took its toll, i am gonna sign up for Dryden United again this summer, played one season 3 years agobut was too out of shape and did not enjoy it at all.

PM sent Paul...i think we could be mutually beneficial to each other here. Did you get to keep the boat!!!!????    Thanks LBH.....and congrats to you...i'm only 2 days in and am in awe of those of you who continue to successfully not smoke    Went to pick up a prescription today(unrelated to my smoking issue) and was looking at the nicotine gum in anticipation of my first fishing trip without smokes. The pharmacist said it was a good idea and would not be harmful to double with the patches for short periods. During our conversation he also mentioned Champix and was very enthusiastic about it, he said the same thing about the smell turning your stomach when using Champix. I dont think i will be unsuccessful the way i'm doing it now...even at this early stage...but its always good to have a plan B.  Thanks Again SRT8    Interesting take on the issue, not sure i agree with all of it...but absolutely agree with getting to a point of ""acceptance"",  only for me its accepting i am not gonna smoke ever again...no matter whether I think I love it or hate it.

Never been through the other stuff but ""death sticks"" are really really difficult to quit but I'm determined this time.  When you have the urge, wait ten or 15 minutes and chances are it'll be gone.  From one limey to another.......good luck man!   Dan"
590675,bigcreekdad,2011-06-07 19:59:00,546,"If I can do it, you can too.  If you had an alcohol problem and quit, you will find, in hindsight, this is nothing.  Good luck!!"
590678,smally21,2011-06-07 20:07:00,993,"avoid the things that you associate with smoking. waking up, eating, coffe breaks, working, fishing, playing cards, hanging in the garage, BBQing, a certain group of buddies that smoke their faces off, etc.  the more you smoke the more of these habit smokes you have...id try to avoid the situations you find yourself in that it would seem most natural to smoke."
590681,Terry,2011-06-07 20:10:00,14456,about 8 guys just quit smoking at work and they all found it easy they all used Champix
590683,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-07 20:16:00,4399,"Just about 16 months for me and doin fine, there is no way heck I could have done it with out the help of Champix. In my humble opinion Champix is a miracle drug, if you are truly committed to quitting nicotine and you supply the will power Champix will takecare of the rest!!!  The financial and health benifits of not smoking are obvious but it is so nice not being controlled by a cigarette,standing outside in the cold or rain, always wondering if you have enough smokes to last to whenever and not smelling like a asytray.  Good luck Limey and if the patch does not work consider Champix!!!"
590687,discophish,2011-06-07 20:47:00,392,"Good for you!  I definitely know how it is.  I smoked for 20 years, and have been smoke free for 1 year and 3 months.  It will change your life in many positive ways.  It's worth everything to do all that you can do to make this happen.  Like you said, it will be difficult, but there are things to make it easier on you.  You can do it!  I used the smokestik to aid my battle.  Just knowing that it was there if I needed it played a big mental role.  I didn't even use it all that much.  It was only used to suppress my moments of increased anxiety.  Check it out when you get a chance.  Only use this as a quitting aid and not as a substitute, and only when you really need it!  Fishing has been great without the smoking!  Seriously."
590689,crappieperchhunter,2011-06-07 20:52:00,2582,Good luck Simon....one day at a time...you can do it
590690,splashhopper,2011-06-07 20:53:00,2931,Congrats on 16 years of sobriety brother.  Ask your HP for the obsession to smoke to be lifted...
590698,limeyangler,2011-06-07 21:06:00,5204," Yup...good idea...i'm gonna skip morning coffee...choose a juice or water and do 15 minutes on the cross trainer    Thanks Sinclair, my new I-Pilot is only 40 days away  :thumbsup_anim:    I agree Fish4Eyes, my experience with alcohol taught me just that....for me it will have to be all or nothing approach.     Thanks harrison....hearing the urges will fade is what i need to hear, as for my shore lunches tasting better...never thought of that....AWESOME!   Thanks Dan, i tried the 15 minute thing in the boat yesterday(my last smoking day)...lol...not too successful. But so far today the urges come about every 15 minutes, they pass.  whaT PART OF lIMEY LAND YOU FROM?    i HOPE SO!     LOL...not much to avoid then.     i'll keep that in mind    Thanks LFW.....I am looking forward to the freedom as you say."
590703,lew,2011-06-07 21:31:00,12766,"Everytime you think you really need a smoke Simon, get on your computer and look up a picture of  advanced lung cancer .  My best friend for the past 35 years developed throat cancer 25 years ago from smoking. They cleared him up and it reappeared 8 years later, but only worse and they had to remove his voice box and he now talks with one of those vibrating gizmos.  Last week he found out he now has cancer in his esophogus and he's just waitng for the prognosis as we speak.  I also smoked for 30 years but gave up those filthy stinking things cold turkey 20 years ago.  There are absolutely no reasons on earth to ever light up another smoke and about a gazillion reasons to quit NOW."
590705,Kerry,2011-06-07 21:35:00,383,"Here's another helpful tip which helped us in our quest to quit.Start cleaning,particularly the areas you frequent the most.Getting the smoke smell out of your living area goes a long way to alleviating the urges as your system changes.Of course once everything has a nice fresh scent it makes it a little tougher to go back.It's been 11 years+ for us. Kerry"
590710,limeyangler,2011-06-07 21:58:00,5204,"Keep it coming folks...muchly appreciated.    Thanks Disco, I am trying to take it one day at a time but i'd be lying if i said the one thing that makes me think its gonna suck is not smoking and fishing....good to hear it don't!    Thanks man...i day or 1 hour at a time i'm gonna get through this!    Good advice...and thank you    LOL...thanks Lew, i think i'll avoid that...the stress of worrying about cancer at this point would make me want to smoke even more...lol.   Thanks Kerry, good advice. I actually stopped smoking in my vehicles and home 8 years ago...lol...kind of happened exactly the same time as i got married...she does not smoke."
590711,kenzy31,2011-06-07 22:01:00,261,"check out a book written by ""Alan Carr""  called Easy Way to Quit Smoking.  myself and 4 of my friends read that and been smoke free for 3 months, 5 months, 11 months, and 16 months!  one went back to it and we hope the best for him...and you as well!!  you'll wonder what could have ever made you want those things in the first place.  best of luck, we're pullin for ya"
590712,toca,2011-06-07 22:03:00,274," I Used The Gum Instead Of The Patch. Bought Three Boxes Of Those 42 Piece Of Gum And In Three Months I Was Addictted To The Gum... Slowly Weened Myself Off The Gum And Im Now Two Months Nicotine Free.  I Found Myself Smoking In Between Gum, Or Once In A While Kind Of Thing(bumming smokes). but i still kept at it until finally one day the brain just finally decided i didnt need that smoke first thing in the morning.  Good Luck, Ted  P.S Also Dont Let Other Discourage You. If You Slip You Slip Its Not Like Your Smoking Two Packs A Day. Every Day Is One Step Closer To Quitting Smoking."
590713,toca,2011-06-07 22:05:00,274," Read This Book. Even Took The Seminar. Its Not For Everybody.  Ive Read This Book Quit Two Days, Took The Seminar Quit 23 Hours. like I said Its not for everybody."
590717,GBW,2011-06-07 22:14:00,8460,"just don't waste the cash on the 'laser therapy' because it only worked for me for 36 hours.  my brother in-law lasted 4 or 5 months that way then went back to smoking too.  next time I try it will be with champex too but you have to want to quit not someone telling you to quit.  you wanting to quit is more powerful then doing so because you are forced to.  Good luck, I hope you can do it!"
590731,Spiel,2011-06-07 22:35:00,9065,"Quitting is easy Simon, I've done it many times.  Most recently Jan. 6th 2011 for 5 months....  Yes I'm weak at times but I'll kick this nasty habit one day, someday, permanently!  Nasty, nasty habit..... *choke, cough*"
590733,motv8tr,2011-06-07 22:48:00,2587,"If you want to quit it, you will, the process is no different than giving up alcohol...I stopped smoking after more than 30 yrs 2 yrs ago and never looked back.  Like others in the past I had tried to quit but always for the wrong reasons, once I made the choice for myself, it was easy...sort of  Good luck Maureen"
590763,beginner,2011-06-07 23:51:00,542,"I think most everyone said it all but all I can say good thing you quit smoking, jack is growing and he sees you... What ever you do has impact on him... good on you man!.. And remember all the molla you save more fishing stuff...  all the best Simon"
590776,Dave Bailey,2011-06-08 00:21:00,1641,"Congratulations! But...  Make sure you get regular medical check-ups. Nicotine is highly addictive, and I have trouble believing that suddenly cutting yourself off after so many years won't cause physical stress. I don't want to scare you, but I have seen many life-long smokers quit cold turkey and then develop serious medical conditions soon after. Can't hurt to let your doctor know, and get a full physical work-up asap, and frequently thereafter. In the meantime...  "
590781,irishfield,2011-06-08 00:38:00,26272,"Simon, I remember my father always saying ""when they hit a $1 a pack I'm quitting"". Now the 6 feet of soil sitting on top of him, since 1986, doesn't allow him to spend $10+ a pack. If cancer hadn't killed him he'd probably still be doing so!"
