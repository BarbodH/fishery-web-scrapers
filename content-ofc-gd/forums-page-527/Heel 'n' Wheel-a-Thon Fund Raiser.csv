590789,Ron,2011-06-08 00:48:00,1683,"Glad to help out Wayne, it's the least we can do.  For those of you who are still debating, quit sitting on the fence and let's set her OFC goal to $4000.00 raised! It just takes a few dollars each, sacrifice one fishing lure in honour of Jennifer. You won't regret you did it.  Here is the link to read her story/Youtube.  Heel'n'Wheel - Jennifer O'Shea  Cheers, Ron..."

591865,irishfield,2011-06-11 01:56:00,26272,I guess one walk per weekend wasn't enough! Felt she should join the Relay for Life tonight here in Penetang and did the opening Survivor lap. I think she just wanted the nice yellow t-shirt!   (not sure where she gets the spunk from) 
592153,irishfield,2011-06-12 03:47:00,26272,Not tooooo late folks!!! Leah and Jennifer left for the city around 8pm so that Jennifer can be at the park for 9am to register her and her team for the 5km walk. She says she's gonna leave the wheel chair in the truck !
592271,irishfield,2011-06-12 21:39:00,26272,This one says it all folks. 7 gals in stretchy pants just for GBW ! LOL Jen walked the entire 5km with her girlfriends. No chair used.  
592272,mercman,2011-06-12 21:47:00,7054,And i thought you were tough Wayne!!!!She is one inspiring young woman I believe she is unstoppable my friend. Great job Jen
592276,Spiel,2011-06-12 22:01:00,9065,"I'm totally verklempt Wayne, she is one amazing girl, you and Leah are undoubtedly very proud and rightly so!"

587274,Tarzan's Jane,2011-05-27 17:28:00,1183,"Hi Jen;  I too missed this, but I haven't been around much.  I took care of my step-Dad last week.  He lives out of town and is presently going through radiation and chemo for stage 3 lung cancer.  Radiation is every day, chemo is once a week. (for now)  He is such a sick man....so weak....so frail....and so determined.  You and he are heroes to me.  I will pledge and I will be thinking of you on those days.  It is the least I can do to show you that you have touched my life.  I have to believe that your passion for others is an opportunity for the rest of us to get on board and help you attain your goal and in so doing bring you joy.  Thank you for doing this for all those who suffer.  Nancy"
587299,irishfield,2011-05-27 18:55:00,26272,THANKS Nancy !! Keep your chin up ! (and then cry at home.... it works for us!    )

587665,irishfield,2011-05-29 03:39:00,26272,"THANKS Guys!!!  She's gonna be one tired cookie by weeks end. She's running the money table at her best friends (Jen is her Maid of Honour in Sept) Buck and Doe tonight until 1am (that we just left) in Elmvale. All of us back to TO tomorrow for noon, then a full week of chemo starting 8am Monday, ending Saturday afternoon. A bridal shower for another Friend Saturday night in Toronto (that we suspect she'll last about an hour at being fresh out of the Sarcoma unit) and then this walk Sunday am. Don't get too excited if she misses the Sunday event, as that also involves a drive up to Barrie to do so and then she has to be back in Toronto for a Pre-op appointment Monday at 9:30am. Mind you... I don't know where she finds half the energy she does, so it may go ahead as planned. The walk a week later in Toronto is for certain. Walk or wheelchair."
587820,danbouck,2011-05-29 17:48:00,4380,84% almost there!
587967,irishfield,2011-05-30 02:08:00,26272,"Thanks Folks! Now at over $2500 thanks in part to the wonderful people here. Now if some previously promised donations come in, and a bit of hope, she'll reach her goal."
589114,irishfield,2011-06-02 04:01:00,26272,Thanks Kelvin!! Cheque arrived safe and sound. Great to see another promise come true.
589362,danbouck,2011-06-03 02:53:00,4380,Only $340 to go
589637,irishfield,2011-06-04 00:46:00,26272,"Thanks Dan ! Still waiting for some of those promised donators to jump in.  She's got a ""pitch"" walker for Sunday in Barrie. A week Sunday she will be with her team for the Toronto walk/wheel and thanks to GBW we have a nice push style wheel chair for her gf's to take turns wheeling her thru the park if she gets too tired. I suspect she'll use the chair as a walker for the most part... or possibly leave it behind all together, we'll have to wait and see."
589996,irishfield,2011-06-05 21:19:00,26272,"We'll we test drove the wheel chair today. About 2pm Jen wanted McDonald's, seems to be a strange thing with chemo patients that generally never eat there but then suddenly get a craving. I told her I wouldn't go get it for her.... she had to come along. So I pushed her to the diagonally opposite corner of the full city block to Dupont and Dufferin and back home. So I did a good part of what the walk would have been in Barrie... oh and the LCBO happened to get hit on the way back to!!   (that pocket is handy on the back Geoff!!)"
590010,GBW,2011-06-05 22:05:00,8460,Yeehaa!  I'm glad to see it's working out for you all.
590455,Loonietoon,2011-06-07 01:31:00,1450,"Glad you got it Wayne, I was a little worried about the Strike and it getting caught up in it.. Hope all goes Well as I know it will... Give Jen our Best she is a strong Girl thats for sure."
590495,irishfield,2011-06-07 02:30:00,26272,It's in hand Kelvin and will be turned in next Sunday for the Toronto walk. Good thing she didn't do the walk yesterday.. BP was 79/58 today when taken for her pre-op screening....
590597,ehg,2011-06-07 13:40:00,2666," Again Wayne your daughter is a real trooper. Going through all this is brutal.  Seems like you are spending a lot of time in my hood. Live around College and Grace and boot over to the Dupont/Dufferin McDonalds for their $1.39 muffin/coffee deal. Actually like their coffee now more than the overrated Timmies stuff.  Best wishes to your daughters health!  Whatever way she goes it should be fun to participate in the fundraiser walk.  Cheers, Erik"
590628,irishfield,2011-06-07 15:24:00,26272,Erik.. she lives near the Lansdowne subway station.

558199,irishfield,2011-03-05 01:13:00,26272,"I don't usually pass these on for Jennifer but considering the spunk and determination this young women of ours continues to show, considering she can't even be positive that she'll be able to walk come June (with no date yet set for removing her Cancerous pelvic bone and hip socket) I just have to try to help her raise as much money for Crohn's research as we can. I'll push her in a wheel chair or on a stretcher if I have to. THANKS, Wayne  Dear Supporter,  THANK YOU to everyone who sponsored me last year. Thanks to you I was able to raise a little over $1,800. My team (J Walkers) raised an additional $1,100 meaning we raised nearly 3 thousand dollars.  I will be participating in two Heel 'n' Wheel-a-Thons again this year. First in Barrie (Simcoe County) on June 5th and then again the following Sunday in Toronto with my team of girlfriends.  With everything going on in my life this year I briefly considered doing one of the walks for cancer instead. But the fact is, Crohn's and Colitis are still such unknown diseases and there is just this one walk to raise money for research. We need every participant and pledge we can get if there's ever going to be a cure.  By going to my ePledge page you can watch and/or read ""My Story"" of Crohn's Disease and learn how it has affected my life. I truly appreciate every pledge, whether you can give a little or give a lot, you're helping me attain my personal goal. And with every pledge, we get one step closer to finding a cure.  I'm walking so that hopefully one day others don't have to go through what I have!  ***Above was written by me, the following is added automatically***  This June, I’ll be participating in the 2011 Heel ‘n’ Wheel-a-Thon to raise money for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada (CCFC). The CCFC is a national not-for-profit voluntary medical research Foundation, whose mission is to find the cure for inflammatory bowel disease.  As you know, this cause is very important to me, and that is why I’m asking you to help me out in my fundraising efforts this year.

560933,irishfield,2011-03-12 03:04:00,26272,Takes after her Mother Ron.. no doubt there at all in my mind.  One more night here at Sinai and we can break her loose in the morning.  Tomorrow will be 6 chemos down.. 4 to go.

Well the date is upon us and I'm probably gonna have to live up to my word in the very first post and push her in a wheel chair. She'll be fresh out of a full week of chemo on Saturday afternoon (June 4th) and it's pretty doubtful she'll be able to walk more than a few feet on the 5th for the Barrie event. Hopeful that she can do the whole thing the following weekend in Toronto on the 12th... but we'll have the chair ready there as well.
