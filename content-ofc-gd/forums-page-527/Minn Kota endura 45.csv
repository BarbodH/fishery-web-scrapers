593040,Jds63,2011-06-14 18:57:00,1365,I just bought MK 45 trolling motor and the manual says to install a 50 amp circuit breaker. I did some online searching and found some priced at 19.99.   Minn Kota has its own branded 60 amp circuit breaker for double the price.   Does anyone know what store might sell these closer to Durham Region. I picked up the trolling motor at BPS but didn't know about the circuit breaker. Thanks

593043,scugpg,2011-06-14 19:09:00,1373,I've always used the $12 manual reset breakers from NAPA they look like the top picture and never had any issue.  You can get them in various amp ratings.
