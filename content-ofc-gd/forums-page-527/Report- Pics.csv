592397,TDunn,2011-06-13 02:07:00,680,"  Good eye! Laurentian Lodge is amazing, simple as that! Rod is an awesome guy too. He even took us out for an evening to one of his favourite lakes where we caught the biggest speck of the trip. I just might have to take you up on your offer. Thanks!  Tyler"
592402,ctdd2006,2011-06-13 02:40:00,531,Rod's a great host!  Glad you guys had a good trip.  What cabin were you in?  Which way did you travel for the speck?  Boland Road?  Camp Eight? Portelance?
592403,ctdd2006,2011-06-13 02:44:00,531,...how deep on flack?  I fished the spanish today and surface temps are still 60 degrees!?  I'm guessing flat lining on light gear is still an option?...or should I mount the riggers?
592432,TDunn,2011-06-13 04:37:00,680," Personally, I always have the riggers on. We were getting them in 50-70 feet on the other side of the lake out from the small creeks. Ya temps are still cool here too. The St. Marys was 46 yesterday. I don`t remember the name of the lake we fished but it was near bitstock"
592535,corvette1,2011-06-13 15:42:00,1765,awesome trip
592547,Skud,2011-06-13 16:42:00,739,Great report. Sweet pics
591846,TDunn,2011-06-11 01:08:00,680,"Hey Guys!  It has been at least a few weeks since my last report which I believe was early season steelhead. I continued with steelhead for another week or two up north on Superior tribs then spent most of my time in the rapids chasing some bigger fish. It was the best steelhead run Ive ever seen in the rapids and THIS is going to help!  Superior                St. Marys         A few weeks ago I was out on Superior looking for kings with my cousion Ted before he went up to Marmac lodge for the summer. All we ended up with was this bow.    We did mark a ton of these tho!      I have had the opportunity to get out for some brookie action too! Both in LSPP and other inland lakes.                         I havent been out for lakers to much yet. I spent a day on the water chasing lake trout near Elliot Lake. Although we must have caught 20 fish that day they were all bananas We tried several different lures when trolling and jigging. Almost all caught fish!               Last weekend I went east of town to a small walleye lake. I had most of my luck with a shad rap smashed right off bottom.  Dinner   Tomorrow I am heading back out on Superior in search of some spring kings. Then next week, I'm off to camp in Hornepayne. This trip is dedicated to trying out 2 new trout lakes which i am very excited about!  I hope you enjoyed and good luck on the water!  TDunn"
591847,irishfield,2011-06-11 01:11:00,26272,Thanks for taking the time Tyler !
591851,DundasSteelheader,2011-06-11 01:24:00,166,Nice fish!  Those brookies are huge!
591863,Roy,2011-06-11 01:47:00,13728,"Thanks for that, Tyler. You have yourself a great summer!"
591870,Rod Caster,2011-06-11 02:06:00,5784,Nice collection of photos. Eye candy to say the least.
591874,Grimace,2011-06-11 02:20:00,2020,That's pretty awesome.
591876,msp,2011-06-11 02:24:00,1336,Great report and nice fish. Those Superior tribs look so peacefull and quiet. Your livin the life up there !
591885,splashhopper,2011-06-11 02:55:00,2931,awesome dude
591919,spinnerdoc,2011-06-11 06:50:00,556,those are some nice fish pics and even nicer scenery
591926,limeyangler,2011-06-11 10:10:00,5204,"Stunning Tyler.  2 questions...what the hell is a 'banana'....lol  and did you have live bait with you for the walleye and they hit lures better, or is it just that you did not have any. I'm relatively new to this kind of fishing and am always intrigued by walleye caught with lures....i've had a few but not often...guess i dont use them enough maybe. Just curious.....i dont know if you get what i'm asking....lol...neither do i...its 5am.   Anyhoo...great report!"
591928,solopaddler,2011-06-11 10:18:00,8605,Very nice Tyler! If you're fishing brookie lakes in the Hornepayne area it's entirely possible I'm familiar with them.  Will be looking forward to that report!  Cheers
591932,TDunn,2011-06-11 10:56:00,680,"  Haha  We call a small fish a banana sometimes....kinda looks like one!  As far as live bait goes, ya we did have some. We caught a few jigging minnows but did much better casting and trolling cranks in 8-12 feet. Next time your out and the walleye are ""on"" try a crank....its easier to build confidence in a lure or technique when the fish are around and biting. Cranks are responsible for some of my biggest walleye.     Mike,  ya we are after brookies,lakers and maybe some bows. I will be doing some walleye/pike fishing at the camps lake but probably just in the evenings. The days are going to be spent exploring the backroads. I have a good idea of where Im going but I will PM you for some info or ideas. Most of my time will be spent north of Nagagamisis lake.  Thanks to all for the great replies!  Now Im off for atlantics in the river....the weather today is keeping me off Superior!!    TDunn"

591959,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-11 13:12:00,0,awesome dude.  i was starting to wonder where you were. good on you for getting some photos in.  seems every time i've been fishing in the last month it's rained (apparently it rains EVERY weekend including this one!) i'm itching for atlantics and i want to try and get some on the pin this year...  cheers.

592367,ctdd2006,2011-06-13 01:16:00,531,"Flack Lake is about numbers usually and the quality of the table fare...rarely any size, but the big ones are there...but they've eluded me for 20 years.  The lodge is great though!  Next time your in the area shoot me a message...I'll show you around a bit if you want.  I've got a few stashed boats on a few great little speck lakes."
