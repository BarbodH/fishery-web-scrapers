937796,super dave,2015-10-02 17:45:00,323,I have a jackson big tuna and its a heavy beast so decided to put on  trolling motor.   i've taken it apart and got the speed controller out.  I want to extend the wires to the solo seat position but i'm having a tough time finding some wires.  Where would one get some extra wires?   The minn kota wires don't have any ID number so don't even know how I could match the wire gauge.  Has anyone done a yak mod like this and can provide some advice?
