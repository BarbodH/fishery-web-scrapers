938137,aplumma,2015-10-04 18:21:00,6896,My views on the president reflect how he has failed us in my opinion. You will find the same comments all over Canada on your political figures. Rarely will you find a man who can make everyone happy. I will not make everyone happy with my opinions same as you will not make everyone happy. Ohio Fisherman has bashed the USA in many posts however he decided to come after me when it suits him. No issue from me his opinion has no infuence on me or my opinions. He is an Obama supporter I am not just that simple. I have had to vote for the lesser of two evils for the last 4 terms same as a lot of people. We all are hoping for a hero and he has not gotten here yet. I will at this time bow out and will not get into a political discussion the outcome of those usually leave good friends not talking anymore. I value everyone who has an opinion here as long as it is said civilly and without  malice.  Art

So, what you're saying is when the government enacts stricter rules and punishes the masses for the mishaps caused by a few bad apples it will magically stop the problem? I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but stricter rules and harsher penalties on the highway have not stopped drunk driving, speeding, or distracted driving. Care to explain how stricter gun control will somehow stop people with bad intentions from getting their hands on firearms? You can't, because it wont and never will. Why? The majority of firearms used in crime are either imported from other countries and/or stolen from law abiding enthusiasts.  How will stricter rules for law abiding citizens stop someone from breaking into their home and stealing their firearms? It wont. How will  banning certain firearms stop people from committing murder? It wont. How will stricter licensing requirements prevent senseless deaths when criminals get guns off the streets? It wont. Maybe we should try some sort of registry to better track firearms to save lives? That doesn't work either.  I'm not arguing or making up excuses, just trying to give you a different perspective from a well informed and law abiding citizen who enjoys owning and using firearms.   What sort of gun control do you believe would stop these killings?"

Look at police officers, how many hours of hands on training do they get in real life scenarios and THEY still freeze/screwup/whatever when faced with the real thing.  Personally if the only way I could feel safe was with a gun at my side, I'd move.   I can't imagine living life like that to be honest.

I also believe that America's political machine is badly broken - driven by self serving lobbyists, big business and right wing conservative bullies who will do anything to gain power. Unfortunately Obama, Hillary or even Donald (God help us all) will have an uphill, nearly impossible task of bringing about any significant reform, whether it's on guns, border issues, immigration, the environment or economics.

I have grown up around firearms my entire life, rifles, shotguns, handguns and still enjoy the sport of skeet and long range, but I do feel that certain checks and balances are required for those who wish to own any firearm.   There are certain firearms that have very little purpose besides in a hostile environment.  Any AR platform with a box magazine, what purpose does this pose for a hunter or sportsman, just one of many possible examples. Simple fact, society is a messed up place, some worse then others.  America stands by a constitutionalr night that was written in a time, by people that could not even fathom the outcome of their decisions.  But when it comes to the health and well being of their people, it seems those rights are not as important.  Until someone finally addresses the root cause, a society with a self centered, my rights are more important then others, America will continue to see their innocent gunned down while trying to achieve that ""American dream"""

It just seems to be something with the United States that make so many of them so violent, so often, whether their using guns, bombs  or pencils. Lew it is not the gun that is the issue it is the people who think that killing innocentpeople acceptable. Every person has the ability to not kill thy neighbor you have to over ride that reflex to do those things. You first reflex in any situation is to run from conflict. Say we could get the guns off the street from the good guys very possible do you think the people who have made the decision to use them illegally will turn theirs in? so reality is guns are here to stay in the USA no way around it. The density and the complex life style we have/want is high pressure and is present every where is not as dense in Canada. The Percentages are slated  unbalanced people exists every where in the world. If I didn't have a gun and I wanted to kill I can produce a weapon in 10 minuted misusing common products available around the house. Put the blame where it belongs SOCIETY  is broken no doubt and it appears up North as well as down here. There is no difference between one man killing another for a reason that is socially not acceptable  than a man who kills 10 people. After the first one is killed they are no more crazy than the man who only had one victim. The media however will give excessive coverage on the mass murder because people by nature feed off the news in a ghoulish manner. Look how often the lead stories are of tragedies rather than all of the good things going on around you.   Art"

How anybody could bring up a pencil..... seriously? With a pencil you might kill one or two victims max before 10 other people could grab something to bash your frigging brains in. Against a gun that isn't going to happen as easily despite what American TV shows/movies would have us believe. I would wager is pretty hard to shoot straight when you are crapping your pants at the same time as firing...  What will the NRA say when all the teachers, custodians and other school employees are armed and it happens again. Or heaven forbid one of the employees snaps and starts spraying bullets?  I know all the gun bans/registering won't stop it from ever happening again, because criminals don't register their guns... However, arming more people hasn't worked so far as gun sales have sky rocketed after every shooting, from fear that the government will take away guns or stop the sales... The pencil is to show any object can become a weapon. I can in 10 minutes in your average house make a mass destruction weapon. The scary part is you can do the same using the internet. I am not trying to change anyones mind on guns and I envy Canadas lack of handguns on the street. The issue is once you got them out there gun control will not take them off the street. We are failing as a society all over the world and we all seem to have opinions and disparaging remarks instead of realistic answers. I personally do not have the answer I so far have not read a single answer to prevent man on man violence either here or anywhere I have search for it.

Look at police officers, how many hours of hands on training do they get in real life scenarios and THEY still freeze/screwup/whatever when faced with the real thing.

To my buddy Lew we have chased this discussion like a dog and his tail while fishing and I always come to the same answer and that is that what you have up North is golden and I hope it stays that way.  John how many people have the proper training to have a handgun in there possession the honest answer is very few. There is no requirement for any training to own a handgun. We have required training for hunting with rifles or shotguns. I would support a ridged training course as well as physiological testing before issuing a handgun permit to purchase a handgun instead of the current system to get a concealed permit. The real question the big one of can I use the gun to take a life had better be answered before you ever have to pick up the gun for defense. If the situation is life threatening and you hesitate the gun you pulled might be the gun that gets you killed. Remember we are talking about life threatening, not protect your property or teach an intruder a lesson. Anger has nothing to do with this it is simply the first one to shoot is the one who walks away. Am I happy about this ? no not at all can I change this? realistically no I cant. It falls into the category of one of the downsides of life here but I can honestly say it is a small price to pay to be here in what I consider a great place to visit.  BillM I agree if I needed to have a hand gun on my side to feel safe I would move that thankfully is rarely the case. I have a better chance of shooting a bear than I do an intruder.    Art"

Gun laws have changed greatly over those same years,so in point guns were probably more easily available 20-30 years ago and this type of event happening a lot less frequently. Today it seems to be sadly a weekly event. It seems like the same story everytime, some young person who feels like he does not fit in,maybe a little different,not a lot of friends,desperate to be accepted. How much pressure is on the young people of today to have a sense of belonging? With social media who some of these young people seem to truly believe the world revolves around,selfies,facebook,twitter,like,...the pressure to feel liked and popular has to be tremendous. Add in some of the parenting today,the helicopter parents,protecting them from everything in life,doing everything for them does not prepare them for the real world. They need to succeed but also learn what it is like to fail and learn from it. I fear this will continue and increase with or without tighter gun laws,society needs to change. Yes the guns did kill these kids but they do not fire or load on their own. It is hard for me to believe that it has to come to this for some of these people,but then again I grew up in a different era"

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the police there don't even carry pistols.  edit: and while I'm on that thought, I was captivated by an episode of COPS the other day and my wife noted that the police officer was being very intense with these guys during a routine traffic stop. I thought about it, and then noted the appearance of these guys (grubby looking middle aged white guys), the fact that drugs were found in the car, and the fact that there is a very good chance that one or both of these guys could be armed. Not to say it would have transpired different in Canada, but the fact that anyone can be armed puts everyone on edge.  On topic though: this is a terrible tragedy and I'd ask out of respect for the victims that we not speculate on the circumstances until the facts are irrefutably available."

Sir, I don't think it is smugness or superiority at all, and I am certainly not offended. For some reason there seems to be a disconnect with a reasonable, rational, behavior in society here in a lot of places, and on a lot of issues!  As an American? I wonder at times how well adjusted some of my fellow citizens are to all the freedoms they have? Some certainly find enough to complain about or be angry at everything.  I don't have answers, only questions, there seems to be no end to the violence."

937778,bare foot wader,2015-10-02 15:46:00,1354,"can anybody say that the Brits, for e.g., are any less free for not having hand guns??  They are certainly free enough to replace guns with knives in their increasing violent crime rate...  It's very sad to hear about yet another school shooting. I've been through Oregon several times, and spent a good chunk of last fall working in Colorado near Columbine, drove past the school a few times. It seems these tragedies happen more often than not in places you wouldn't suspect, in well to do neighbourhoods. I won't get into the banning guns debate, or even knives in the UK for that matter. I think there are much deeper underlying issues than simply access to guns or knives that lead to these tragedies...and there is no easy answer there.  I will say, however, I think a big part of the problem is our fear mongering style of media system and the coverage these shooters get. That's their moment of fame and recognition. For whatever reasons they feel the need to hurt people, and the media spot light is their incentive or reward. They get their names and faces plastered all over tv channels and internet. I wish that would stop. Pay tribute to the victims, not the criminals."
937779,Headhunter,2015-10-02 16:01:00,5703,"Well, according to what I have read here and other places, if only the students and teachers and custodians and lunch room folks were all carrying, none of this would have happened. Now you all know that I don't subscribe to that theory, but that is what so many of the gun advocates will say. My gut twists every time we hear about incidents like these. I can't help that think of the loss that not only family and friends have taken, but the society as a whole. Could one of those victims turned out to be the doctor who cures cancer? Discovers a new a completely clean re-newable energy source. All the potential that those people had are now gone and lost to the world for ever. I guess their right to liberty and freedom don't weigh as heavily as others rights to bare arms and the easy access to them that has been enshrined in the country's mindset. HH"
937789,mr blizzard,2015-10-02 16:52:00,1589,bare foot wader I totally agree the media needs to pay more attention to the victims rather than spot lighting the suspect as was even agreed with on the national news this morning

Brady Press Briefing Room, named for a man severely wounded by a would-be assassin’s bullet, “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up.”  Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass shootings, people had “become numb to this.” “And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” Mr. Obama said. “Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ‘We need more guns,’ they’ll argue. ‘Fewer gun-safety laws.’ ” “Does anybody really believe that?” he asked, his voice rising."

So there was a warning. Are the feds down there and here too busy to not take domestic terrorism seriously?  Apparently this is something that goes on with social media regularly. I don't envy the task that law enforcement has here or down south. The really sad reality was several people on line encouraged the shooter to do something. I just don't know where our societies world wide are going. From the nuclear threats from 3rd world countries with insane dictators with the ability to start a world war where no one can survive to the middle east disasters and the real threat of domestic terrorism. When I was a kid we had nuclear war drills, the Viet Nam war, Olympic terrorism in Munich but I never had to worry about going to school. I'm afraid some kid here will copy cat the more it happens down in the states, it happened in Alberta soon after the Columbine shootings.  Is it time to have armed soldiers everywhere in North America? It has been that way in Europe for years now. I remember how unsettling it was to see Police with machine guns in the airports and on public streets the first time I went overseas in the early 70's. It looks like it's time here.

Because Johnny's dad thinks he'll be a superstar and wants everyone toknow it. 2) The availability of the internet has brought good things, but also a lot of horrible things like cyber bullying and instant access to horrifically graphic content.  Combine those two things, and you end up with kids who have no direction or discipline, who have been exposed to so much violence they have become desensitized.
