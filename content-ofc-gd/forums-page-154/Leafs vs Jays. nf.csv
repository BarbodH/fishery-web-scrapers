938650,captpierre,2015-10-07 23:50:00,2521,Having a hard time getting excited about the Leafs with the Jays chasing the big enchilada. Even playing the Habs.  ?
938659,tb4me,2015-10-08 00:44:00,3295,Im not a fan of the MLB at all but I wish the Jays luck...Now Go Leafs Go!!!!
938673,ccmtcanada,2015-10-08 03:13:00,7971,Leafs vs Jays?  I say Jays beat the leafs at hockey......lol  Seriously though.  I'm a die hard Leafs fan through and through....always have been....always will!
938675,GBW,2015-10-08 03:41:00,8460,The funny part was all the Jays at the Leafs game tonight and SOME of them wearing Hab's gear... *edit* the others had Leafs gear on with their name on the back like Stroman (spelling as I'm not a baseball fan at all)
938685,Thrilla,2015-10-08 12:24:00,164,"Watched the NL wildcard instead of the opener for the leafs, just can't get exited about them anymore. Baseball game was awesome, now go Jays!!!!!!"
938707,adolson,2015-10-08 15:53:00,783,"I remember watching the Jays win the World Series both years when I was a kid. I don't follow sports anymore, but it'd be great for today's Canadian kids to get a similar treat."
938708,Steve,2015-10-08 16:09:00,2075,"I was interviewed on CTV 6pm news last night....  Asked me who I was more excited for....as I was wearing my Leafs jersey going into the Leafs game.  All I could say was, I wish the Jays success, however, GO LEAFS GO!  last night's Leaf game was fantastic.  No 7th inning stretches needed to wake the fans up, lol.  You can see the importance of the Jays nationally, when their first two games are in the afternoon on a weekday.  Was nice to see a half dozen Jays at the Leafs game last night...they were also down in the platinum louge signing autographes between periods.  Wished them luck."
