937980,lew,2015-10-03 15:30:00,12766,"Atta boy Mike, beauty fish, very very nice !!"
937997,Gallie,2015-10-03 16:41:00,1215,Beauty fish mike! Always nice to be rewarded for toughing it out!
938003,captpierre,2015-10-03 18:05:00,2521,Beauti! Pushin 50.
938006,bigbuck,2015-10-03 18:08:00,2449,"Nice 'ski!! Just goes to show that whatever direction the wind blows, there are always fish to be caught. Persistence pays off."
938007,irishfield,2015-10-03 18:10:00,26272,"Nice fish Mike! Hoping I can get enough accomplished around here shortly, so that I can get my boat wet for the first time in 13 months."
938008,lew,2015-10-03 18:16:00,12766," Just goes to show that whatever direction the wind blows, there are always fish to be caught. Persistence pays off.  People that don't fish because of an east wind are missing many many muskies."
938023,misfish,2015-10-03 19:23:00,29133,Thats a tank Mike. Nice.
938026,spincast,2015-10-03 20:10:00,3279,nice catch
938027,davey buoy,2015-10-03 20:15:00,5505,"Nicely done Mike,I have no idea why someone would not want to share their experience with you?,Maybe they will?.I would for sure.Not a bad catch when you are taking someone else out I'd say !!!!!!!!!!!!  ."
938034,dhickey,2015-10-03 21:46:00,1038,Nice fish I wish I could have been the net man.  Don.
938056,mikeh,2015-10-04 01:39:00,824,"Congrats, nice picture of a thick looking fish."
938123,Rizzo,2015-10-04 16:33:00,4754,She's a beaut! Congrats on being rewarded for toughing it out
938200,Cloudy15,2015-10-04 22:26:00,141,"Very nice, This thread inspired me to toss a giant storm thunderstack sun up to sun down on Sat. Lost one at the boat, didn't look anything like that beast tho."
938216,2 tone z71,2015-10-04 23:19:00,1311,That's a beauty ....nice !!!
938240,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-10-05 00:36:00,535,"I was in Ottawa this past Friday, I would have loved to get out there but I had marriage prep, my fianc√©e would not have been pleased. Beauty fish Mike! I have got to get around to fishing with you again, I keep wanting to book a walleye charter but life has been so hectic lately."
937405,mike rousseau,2015-09-30 16:30:00,4661,The position has been filled  Thanks for all the interest and kind words...
937417,darsky,2015-09-30 18:15:00,586,supposed to blow hard on Fri. And if it goes East.........well good luck and bring the best wet stuff you have -yer gonna need it !
937421,Cloudy15,2015-09-30 18:27:00,141,"I would be all over this, if I hadn't planned a weekend of fishing with my friends. It's been in the works for months. Would I be a bad friend if I made up some crazy excuses why i can't go with them anymore?"
937436,manitoubass2,2015-09-30 20:54:00,11391,Umm the seat is filled as per mikes last post.  So you would be a bad friend and sitting on your couch not fishing?
937442,mike rousseau,2015-09-30 21:44:00,4661,As of now forecast is 5km winds...  It it's nasty we are an hour from 2 smaller rivers...
937454,Cloudy15,2015-09-30 22:34:00,141,"Ya, I know it's filled:) Hopefully some pics get posted"
937526,darsky,2015-10-01 02:13:00,586,As of now forecast is 5km winds...  It it's nasty we are an hour from 2 smaller rivers... wanna bet?
937531,mike rousseau,2015-10-01 02:29:00,4661,I'm not sure what we would be betting on or the point your trying to make...  I looked at the weather network and it said 5km NE winds...  Will it be 5km NE winds... Probably not...  But I make plans then react to weather...  I garuntee I will be in my boat fishing Friday... That I will bet on...
937559,bigbuck,2015-10-01 13:19:00,2449,"I just dusted off my crystal ball.....I see water, a boat, a big fishing rod with an even bigger musky at the end of the line.....have fun guys. I would have given my eye teeth to get a crack at that end."
937568,Toronto_Angler,2015-10-01 14:15:00,698,wanna bet?  Why are you trying to be a downer?
937577,darsky,2015-10-01 15:01:00,586,just trying to say that the weather/wind report I saw for fri is stiff N/E winds that can always turn E. And if its a big E wind on Lake St Francis the waves will be BIG against the current. I live an hr east of you and if possible I might get out too buuuuuuuuuut not if its a big Easter.  I am not questioning whether you'll get out or not-just your weather prediction of 5km/hr winds 
937619,mike rousseau,2015-10-01 19:21:00,4661,Musky chop...  There will be sore backs by the time we are through tomorrow...  We will have to avoid the big channels and use the weed beds and islands to block for us...  Never really know how the weather will be until you poke you head out in the morning...
937621,Sinker,2015-10-01 19:23:00,8692,Winds from the East bring out the BEASTS!  S.
937622,lew,2015-10-01 19:24:00,12766,This has become a good thread Mike so I sure hope you give us a story tomorrow evening....fish or no fish
937623,lew,2015-10-01 19:25:00,12766,"Winds from the East bring out the BEASTS!  S.  Shane, up on Nippissing I have my best musky fishing with an easterly wind and hope for it every day I head out."
937626,davey buoy,2015-10-01 19:29:00,5505,And the old saying East is least ?  .
937627,lew,2015-10-01 19:32:00,12766,And the old saying East is least ?  .  That's for the guys that don't know what their doing
937661,Cloudy15,2015-10-01 22:13:00,141,I live by that saying
937735,Sinker,2015-10-02 12:43:00,8692,Weather aint so bad here....hope you guys slay em!
937855,mike rousseau,2015-10-02 22:55:00,4661,https://youtu.be/fqkftVwpd0A  This is nice... Lol
937856,leaf4,2015-10-02 22:58:00,2466,lol so how'd you do today?
937857,lew,2015-10-02 23:10:00,12766,"All I saw in the video Mike was a short clip of a boat in rough water, was that you and if so hold up your catch would ya, enquiring minds need to know"
937963,Fisherpete,2015-10-03 12:20:00,1814,There are no fish in that river. Especially in east winds.
937972,2 tone z71,2015-10-03 13:41:00,1311,Looks like a perfect top water day lol
937979,mike rousseau,2015-10-03 15:13:00,4661,Well we went 2/3...  Landed one casting and one trolling...  The wind was a challenge but it forced us into protected areas and we got a fish in a new spot... So I'm really pumped about that... Can't wait to go fish this new spot in nicer weather...  The name of the game was find fishable/calm waters and then cover ground...  Had a great time with my fishing partner that will go unnamed at his/her request...  Here's my piggy caught trolling  
936874,mike rousseau,2015-09-28 04:33:00,4661,Hey gang...  I might have an open seat Friday for someone to come musky fishing...  All you need is a true heavy duty musky casting outfit... I won't allow light gear in my boat...  And  some gas money (how much depends where we go)... And your lunch... I have tackle and trolling gear...  My regular partner busted his reel Friday so he can't go...  Let me know... I'm hoping someone I've chatted with over the years takes me up on this offer...
936878,FLEX ROD,2015-09-28 10:44:00,394,PM sent.   Great offer.  FLEX - John
936945,Cloudy15,2015-09-28 17:22:00,141,bahhhh jealous....
937021,Gallie,2015-09-28 22:43:00,1215,I dont even know where you live but if i wasnt working friday id be interested! Good of you to offer! Id offer up a day but most people dont wanna fish out of a 12 footer that doesnt leak... It sinks lol
937087,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 03:48:00,4661,"I'm surprised I'm not getting more interest to be honest...  We have boated 13 musky in the last 4 trips including a 56""...  Oh well... I don't mind fishing alone... Lol"
937088,solopaddler,2015-09-29 03:51:00,8605,"I'd love to join you if I could swing it, nice offer!"
937090,Freshtrax,2015-09-29 04:44:00,2215,I'd take you up but I will be on the Lower French with my dad.
937096,lew,2015-09-29 10:14:00,12766,"I'm surprised I'm not getting more interest to be honest...  We have boated 13 musky in the last 4 trips including a 56""...  Oh well... I don't mind fishing alone... Lol  I'm kinda surprised too Mike, I thought for sure there'd be more folks interested in joining you for a day.  Mikes a fun guy to fish with and definitely knows his way around the local waters.  Him and I hooked up for 2 days a couple years back and had a blast, boated a few  muskies and just generally had a great time.  Take Mike up on his offer and you too may just hook in to one of the legendary 2 tone St. Lawrence River  muskies    Or even one of their smaller cousins  "
937104,Moosebunk,2015-09-29 11:25:00,3970,If the offer comes up again I'd join you Mike.  Have fished those waters some too.  This week just kinda stuck making a buck 1000 miles away.
937127,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 14:17:00,4661,Too bed Bunk... Woulda been fun sharing a boat with you
937128,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 14:18:00,4661,Thanks Lew  I thought maybe you woulda brought that skeeter of your down again and let me drive a nice boat for the day... Lol
937131,mepps,2015-09-29 14:30:00,1301,"Great offer! I'd love to get out, but I cant do Fridays!"
937134,leaf4,2015-09-29 14:46:00,2466,"I would love to join, but probably like most, Fridays are tough, great of you to put the offer out though!"
937138,lew,2015-09-29 14:58:00,12766,Thanks Lew  I thought maybe you woulda brought that skeeter of your down again and let me drive a nice boat for the day... Lol  I've thought about it Mike but the B&B I always stayed at is shut down now because of illness and I can't find anywhere else in the area to stay at. There was that big truck stop / restaurant that I stayed in before but that's gone now too. I remember there was a motel not far from you but you said it could be bad spot.
937143,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 15:40:00,4661,Our cottage is always open to you Lew if that's what's stopping you
937144,lew,2015-09-29 15:44:00,12766,"Thanks Mike, is that the place east of the marina ?"
937159,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 16:43:00,4661,Yup  We have a 2 storey boathouse with a cottage upstairs...
937161,lew,2015-09-29 16:50:00,12766,"That's great Mike, let's set something up for next year."
937165,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 17:02:00,4661,Sounds good Lew
937185,Sinker,2015-09-29 19:32:00,8692,Someone has to jump on this. I WISH I could make it!!!  S.
937188,lew,2015-09-29 20:06:00,12766," We have boated 13 musky in the last 4 trips including a 56""..  Any pictures of that brute Mike ??"
937203,Roy,2015-09-29 21:11:00,13728,"I'd like to take you up on that Mike but I can't commit yet because of a family thing. So, if it's still available Thursday morning and things are good here I'll get in touch for arrangements. Thanks."
937210,manitoubass2,2015-09-29 21:40:00,11391,"Gawd Im way too far away but thats awesome of ya mike!  Personally if I ever get the chance to fish with ya its gotta be musky by day, big walleye by night?"
937211,mike rousseau,2015-09-29 21:47:00,4661,That would be great Roy
937392,2 tone z71,2015-09-30 15:45:00,1311,Great offer Mike ..wish I could make it
