Firewood is free at my place, so it's worth the time and effort.  This is my large shed, approx. 15 single cords here. Also have a few bags of splintered cedar.   This is my small shed near the house, approx. 8 cords here. I found a cool piece of yellow birch and put linseed oil on it to preserve it.   The other 7 are in piles in the bush waiting to be moved.

My buddies mom in the Fairbanks area has one of these stoves. She's older and keeps her place really warm (over 80*). And she uses 1 1/4 bags per day during the cold winters there.

Most had some sort of belted conveyor to take it out of the building, they had piles of it higher than the buildings. They had trouble giving it away! All at once that changed, suddenly they had huge dumpsters at the end of the conveyors that the sawdust went into, pellet makers?  Some did the same with slab wood, it was put in huge dumpsters and was taken away to be ground into mulch. Some of those places seemed to have an acre of ground or more filled with mountains of slabwood.  LOL, the good old days, I used to be able to fill my tandem axle trailer that held a cord and a quarter of wood with short cut slab wood for 20-25 bucks."

My guess would be that more Canadians heat with softwood than with hardwood, S. Ont. being an exception.  Most all the wood for sale here is hardwood but I ususlly scrounge some softwood. I thing he ideal ratio is somewhere around 2:1 for hardwood. Softwood is good for milder days and is great for getting the stove and flue heated fast, which is important to reduce soot deposits."

Stacked by mid May. I'd prefer to be a year ahead for that oak, but I split it smaller so it cures faster. Regardless, two years is best for red oak. Still quite cheap heating anyway you look at it.
