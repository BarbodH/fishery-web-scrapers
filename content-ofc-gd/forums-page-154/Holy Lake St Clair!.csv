This was also a recommendation from Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters. In 2.5 days we easily put 250 fish in the boat. Now alot of them were sheep heads and many people scoff at them. Boy do they put up a fight! We got a small musky, a nice walleye and a few largies but most were silver bass and sheep heads. What an incredible fishery!!! Highly recommended. We were sore from catching fish after the weekend. If you have never been add it to the bucket list.

938595,Joeytier,2015-10-07 19:07:00,3990,People who scoff at white bass are fools.  Tons of fun and delicious to eat!
938647,Rizzo,2015-10-07 22:51:00,4754,oh ya...I have hooked into a couple mighty sheepheads. Give a good account of themselves. I love it when musky fishing and a rod goes off and some poor chump loses his turn bringing in a grunting sheephead....good times
938653,leaf4,2015-10-08 00:00:00,2466,"Sounds like a great time, I don't care much of what I catch unless I'm targeting food for the table, so volume of anything is fine by me! Thanks for sharing"
938669,outllaw,2015-10-08 02:09:00,1232,ep were spoiled here.
938681,Shloim,2015-10-08 10:41:00,515,"It was awesome, we could tell when it was a sheepshead on the line as they have that twitch you can feel. We left my buddies boat there cuz were going back this fall!  I've got a pass with the Mrs. because she gets to go see the Dead in NYC Madison square gardens on haloween. It's gonna be hard to go anywhere else now... Indeed  I'm forever spoiled! Sheldon"

938688,limeyangler,2015-10-08 12:34:00,5204,Sounds like a blast. I had people 'scoffing' at sheepshead when I was at Erieau pier. I loved it though…got one that must have been close to 20lbs….they put up an awesome scrap!
938701,landry,2015-10-08 14:57:00,1005,I think sheepshead are good fun. Better than smallies sometimes.  Get a lot dropshotting and they are strong.
938703,manitoubass2,2015-10-08 15:18:00,11391,Id totally target sheephead if I could  Great report!
