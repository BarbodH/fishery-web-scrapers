938155,Tom McCutcheon,2015-10-04 19:48:00,627,Seems to me I have heard this question asked before
938164,Tom McCutcheon,2015-10-04 19:59:00,627,Did you see that answer coming Brian????

938170,misfish,2015-10-04 20:11:00,29133,   Interesting. Im a quack.LOL
938173,Tom McCutcheon,2015-10-04 20:12:00,627,"Getting back on topic...  I think we all have had at some point in our lives, something which has caused us to believe a situation is repeating on us, or we have just done something for the second time.  The ones who can control this thought process are considered Clairvoyant and for those who believe in that stuff, can command a lot of money or ""donations"" for telling fortunes."
938175,glen,2015-10-04 20:18:00,2641,It seems to be a mix of dreams and thoughts and memories. It is very odd. Force yourself to remember what is important and don't worry about the rest.
938182,lookinforwalleye,2015-10-04 20:36:00,4399,Totally it's like deja vu all over again!!
938203,Gerritt,2015-10-04 22:32:00,6129,"Odd subject.... As it is something I have experienced often lately.  That and severe anxiety...  Haven't really had these issues before, or haven't addressed them.  But they are there now. I've seen a doc regarding the anxiety, and am now taking meds to deal with it. But they don't stop the dreams.  It's the subconcience mind connecting with conscience mind.... Putting two and two together...  Still freaky as heck!  Happens more often then not now....... Sleep is difficult.  G"
938214,ecmilley,2015-10-04 23:13:00,2163,i call it flashbacks and usually occours several days after an out of control saturday night

938233,Gerritt,2015-10-05 00:01:00,6129,Thanks Joey  only on one med for it..... Better then the self medicating I was doing.  Immovane I think it's called. I've noticed a huge difference

938300,Steve,2015-10-05 16:29:00,2075,"careful if you find your having increased episodes of deja vu.  that was my precursor to seizures.  they are under control now, (through seizure meds, not anxiety meds), but I know doctors love to pump anxiety meds out when dealing with deja vu.  i know my med levels are off (generally low) if I find myself have increased occurrences.  another thing to ensure you test for is liver enzyme levels (ggt levels). both anxiety and seizure meds do a number on your liver.  i truly feel for anyone who has to take both forms of meds (seizure and anxiety). I'm thankfully only one the former, but my doctor didn't give a crap, and tried to put me on both....  self medication combined with seizure meds is what works for me. but everyone is different, and have to find what works best for the individual.  see multiple doctors if you find your existing doctor is pushing seizure/anxiety meds without offering alternate forms of medication first. These meds should be used as 'last resort'.  but like G said, they often work better than other forms of self medication.  I wouldn't wish this stuff on my worst enemy.  (Dilantin was really bad, Tegretol was much better - side effect wise).  Been since November 2006 since my last seizure....once under control, life becomes much better"
938308,blaque,2015-10-05 18:30:00,2419,"Irony........as i just had a moment this past weekend. I get a deja-vu moment once every few years or so. But when i do, they are quite vivid.  This past instance was me driving with my nephew to hit the piers, he was telling me his work schedule for the upcoming week, i was looking at a flatbed trailer in front of us as he was telling me his work schedule, and it was as precise and accurate as could be to whatever i had thought i had experienced previously. (not sure im saying that right lol) Everything was repeatedly exactly, and i mean right down to the logo of a sticker i was looking at on the trailer. It lasted a few seconds, and then back to ""real time"" lol............I know this could not have actually happened before as my nephew just started his first job 2 weekd ago. Creepy!!  Its one of those things that can get you feeling a little anxious in the moment but passes quickly (thank god)"
938312,Steve,2015-10-05 18:49:00,2075,"I used to get them going through this one specific tim hortons drive through...no other locations...  it was at that drive through, after having these occur for almost a year, that I had a seizure....thank gawd I just rolled into the vehicle in front of me....  I don't like Deja Vu's.....your brain is doing stuff that it shouldn't be doing at that time....  While I was getting the right meds under control, I was wearing a portable EEG machine....it was crazy to see the change in brain activity during a deja vu."
938326,misfish,2015-10-05 20:10:00,29133,"Thanks guys for your honest input.  I see things after I have dreamt them. I have had my fair share of these da ja vu.  I had a dream this weekend that I can only hope I see in the near future. Thats all I can say about it, but it would be very positive.  Thanks again  Wait, I said that already didnt I?"
938328,adempsey,2015-10-05 20:21:00,1498,"If you dream something and can recall it prior to experiencing the event, that's not deja vu.   That's premonition.  Got some lottery numbers for me?"

938333,SirCranksalot,2015-10-05 21:05:00,3291,"I'm not sure how strong the connection is between seizures and deja vu, but I had deja vu in my tewnties and thirties more often than I have it now. I can't remember the last time it happened."
938587,Muskieman,2015-10-07 18:23:00,2472,"Happens to me everytime I do something stupid for the second time . Honestly , it happens quite often , especially when I'm with a certain couple of buddies . My son is 18 and he says it happens to him all the time ."
