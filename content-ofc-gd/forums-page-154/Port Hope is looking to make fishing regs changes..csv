938919,hunteronwheels,2015-10-10 16:51:00,112,the training of local police is a great idea and maybe the mnr can start a paid duty program like the police forces where municipal govt. could pay mnr to patrol the sections they want
938921,Sinker,2015-10-10 17:41:00,8692,MNR just needs to enforce some regulations. Its Bull that they aren't there more often.  Ministry of NO RESULTS  S.
938926,hunteronwheels,2015-10-10 18:28:00,112,they cant be everywhere and there is not enough officers imho
938929,Sinker,2015-10-10 19:04:00,8692,"Exactly. No results. More officers, more charges, more revenue. Git 'er done!"
938936,Garnet,2015-10-10 20:13:00,2056,"My day in Port Hope.  Stop at the Independent for gas.$74 I put the receipt with about 15 others so 15*75= $1125.  Stopped at PH Convience for lottery ticket. Like this place easy access and you can see everything the owner does.  Went fishing for 3 hrs. Then decided to stop at farmers market $14. I usually go to the one on Hwy 28 just before Dale rd. They only sell what the grow. I like that.  Stopped at Gilmers for a 6.5 inch 5/8 bolt. Gilmers is a great hardware store in recent memory I purchased a railing for my parents $1000. Get this I ordered hinges for my kitchen cupboards the guy at service wasn't sure if they were the same so he order 1 and I picked in a couple days later. Wouldn' let me pay for it, took it check it out and order 35 more. Another $150. I've bought paint and lots of other stuff.  Stopped at Tim's.  Safe to say no fishing in Port Hope I spend my money some were else."

937842,fishindevil,2015-10-02 21:54:00,6254,It's been a gong show down there for 30yrs but not as bad as it is now ..... More & more people all the time and most are NOT  fishermen they are just snaggers and citiots there for the slaughter ..... The pics I see on social media are just insane plus all the video clips and the garbage everywhere no real fisherman would do any of that crap !!!!!! It's embarrassing that they would call themselves fishermen !!!!!! But again it's the real fishermen that now suffer because of the idiocy of others !!!!as some of us fish 100-200 days a year some of these idiots come out for a day or 2 a year to participate in the slaughter with no regard for anything so of course any reprocutions that are imposed the fishermen that will respect the laws and conservation will suffer and maybe loose a fishing spot I'm suprised they have not done something about it yet as it gets worse every year .....

At the end of it, as anglers, we all lose out. Even with the increased MNR enforcement, we are really seeing the full gamut of how bad we need the CO's (and how understaffed they are) to patrol the rivers during salmon season.  Couple of weeks ago, on a Sunday, I placed a call to MNR because a couple of dummies decide to fish in a sanctuary. They were catching and releasing fish in a sanctuary. I didn't hear from the CO until Monday, because the COs had their day off. Can't blame them, they're human and not robots and to expect them to be everywhere 24/7 is just not realistic.  I'd be in favour of hiring more COs and look forward to seeing more in the future since they've opened up those new positions."

Happy Thanks Flossin   F n F  Some one with a lot of experience and the ability to make accurate observations on that experience  has just spoken.  Not only are Coho a far better fish once they hit the river from a real angling standpoint but they are by far the best eating of any of the salmonoides/trouts  when caught in the lake. Most people that think they legally hooked a Chinook upstream in a river actually flossed it if the truth were known, lot of people out there are conning themselves."
938000,BillM,2015-10-03 17:54:00,17367,You mean it's not a legal catch if I drift that 5 of diamonds right into it's mouth?  BUT IT'S IN THE MOUTH!?!?!??!?!??!    :)
938002,misfish,2015-10-03 18:03:00,29133,"  Im trying to make sure Im reading this right before commenting Dave.  So drifting a bag or what ever under a float, and the salmon hits (or as you say, flossed  ) the salmon never made a strike at the bait? Am I correct on your statement ? Or, are you talking bottom bouncing and they are getting flossed?"
938012,dave524,2015-10-03 18:28:00,4508,"Yes , a spawn sack below a float even, surprising how frequently they end up in a salmon mouth, especially a kyped up male  with no action on the part of the fish.  edit: not saying in every case but frequently, fly fishing is some of the best flossing which look like legal hookups upon landing"
938018,misfish,2015-10-03 18:46:00,29133,"Yes , a spawn sack below a float even, surprising how frequently they end up in a salmon mouth, especially a kyped up male  with no action on the part of the fish.  I thank you for replying.  Salmon will hit hard baits in the river. They will also hit baits that are under a float.  I have seen this  on the rivers up here. If a salmon will smash a j13 or kwick fish, vibrax spinner (hard body baits) hot shotting in current or being retrieved, they will hit a floating bag,bug or bead under a float.  I have caught my share on hard baits and they strike hard as if they were out in the lake. Watched a float just rip down and to find the bait in the yap or even deeper. Some darken a bit and some as green as if they were out in the open water.  I dont buy when they are in the river they dont eat. If this was true, the the steel head would be floss catches as well, NO?  Of course, Im talking fish that are in pools here. Not those that are in riffs doing the mating thing.  This hen (no kype) hit a floating fresh bag.    I got two this morning drifting a slow drift. They hit IMO.  I can only talk of what I have done and seen.  I have seen my share of the shoulder to shoulder draggers along many of the north shore Lake O tribes. I hate it, dispise it.  I love it up here. Can fish for miles and not see a sole."
938020,dave524,2015-10-03 19:07:00,4508,"Brian , I am not saying that Chinooks won't hit in a river, just that a lot of what appears to be legit upon landing is actually not. I've had enough monster hits swinging a spinner  or hotshotting a flatfish  to know they do but then again there has been those barely perceptible float bumps that come up with a questionable legally hooked fish. Glad you got a place away from the crap, I don't touch rivers anymore until the boots are gone but welcome a late Coho run and of course Bows and Browns.."
