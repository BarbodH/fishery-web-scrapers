Butt Muncher has taken over driving the boat,      he tells me what trail we need to follow,     and shows me how to do a roll cast.     He's still a little guy though, and enjoys his bedtime stories and poems.      ""Whose woods are these, I think I know. His house is in the village though. He will not see me stopping here, to borrow his boat, load up and go.""     ""Mister Kewley must think it queer, to stop without a trout spot near. He gives his Busch can a shake, to ask if there is some mistake.""     ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep. To name the lake, I won't say a peep, It's bounty of trout, we will reap.""      ""There are strange things done in the midnight sun, By the men who moil for pickerels""     ""A full fledged gun cannot endure, the trifling of an amateur. Poor marksmanship its temper spoils, and this is why the gun recoils.""      "
