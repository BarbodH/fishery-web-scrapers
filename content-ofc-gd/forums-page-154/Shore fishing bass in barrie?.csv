938399,Rizzo,2015-10-06 02:38:00,4754,"even though I never tried it while I lived there, I imagine the whole Barrie shoreline could produce smallmouth. Lots of rocky breakwalls."

938418,Ronzo,2015-10-06 13:12:00,124,"I've caught a couple nice smallies from shore on the Barrie waterfront. I usually go to the north-east portion of the park (where the shore runs north-south), and you can cast out toward the bay. Have had decent luck just chucking tubes and working them back to shore."
