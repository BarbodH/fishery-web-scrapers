938042,ecmilley,2015-10-03 22:35:00,2163,"whats everyone using? been using seagar for a number of years and cant say i ve been happy with it for poor knot strength and stretch. spent the $50 bones for a spool of kensei for a flippin stick in 25lb its the worst line i ve ever seen for memory and tangles. Is there a limp low stretch flouro out there, the vanish is ok as a leader material but never liked it as a main line. "
938050,porkpie,2015-10-03 22:57:00,2521,"I've been pretty happy with the seaguar yellow box.  In surprised you've had issues.  I use it for almost everything leader related.  I've used their Abrazx branded stuff, and that's junk.  If your looking for a change, I've used sunline fluoro for steelheading a fair bit, and it's pretty durable stuff.  I find fluoro terrible as a mainline, and don't use it at all, just a long leader if necessary."
938051,Gallie,2015-10-03 23:29:00,1215,"I love seaguar for leader material but ive never liked any fluoro as a mainline. I use power pro for my mainline on everything, spinning baitcasting ice fishing salmon trolling and floro for most of my leaders."
938054,Joeytier,2015-10-04 01:17:00,3990,"I use fluoro on my crankbait/bottom bouncer baitcaster outfit and I love it.  I have 12 lb trilene fluorocarbon, and its very limp and easy to manage, more so than any 12 lb mono on a baitcaster that size"
938057,adempsey,2015-10-04 02:22:00,1498,I've tried Seaguar Red Line and PLine Fluorocarbon as main line and never liked it.   Haven't tried any others and don't intend to.
938064,chefboi17,2015-10-04 09:44:00,128,the one in the gold packaging right? ive been using that one in 6lb as leader material for salmon and steel and i am very impressed with it (very good abraision resistance and knot strength). only problem is finding it in the smaller spools as the big spools dont fit in pockets very well
938065,bigbuck,2015-10-04 11:49:00,2449,"I would not use fluro as a main line. As a leader, definitely. I use it for pike and musky. The San Diego Jam Knot is a very very good knot to use. Not easy but good. I tried fluro main line a few years ago and absolutely hated it. Braid and mono for this kid."
938069,lew,2015-10-04 12:19:00,12766,For years now I've used 130 # Seaguar fluoro & crimps for my musky leaders and it's always been good. I ordered a new spool of the same stuff from JB's this past spring and although it's still 130 # Seaguar leader material it's a fair bit thinner than what I used in the past.  Nice & flexible though and seems like good stuff.

Im not sure how a spooled reel of it would be, but I have been very happy with it as far as knot and line strength goes. yes so just picked up a spool and tied leaders on three rods this morning, spent day dragging tubes and wacky rigging smallies and the suffix is very nice easy to work with great shock resistance, i use a blood knot to tie all my leaders very strong compact knot that i used for years tying my own fly leaders and it works great in this application as well. was looking for a good flouro main line for two flippin sticks for those line shy days, dont like a knot when i am putting a hurtin on bass in heavy cover"
938260,Garry2Rs,2015-10-05 02:10:00,1425,"I have Bass Pro 20-pound on a bait caster.  It works fine. Not a glamourous as the high-end Japanese stuff but KVD was using it for Pitching in a video, so I figured it was worth a try. On spinning reels, I tie on Fluorocarbon leaders in the spring, but when they break, I wind up tying directly to my 10-pound braid. That might not work for trout, but the bass don't seem to care."
