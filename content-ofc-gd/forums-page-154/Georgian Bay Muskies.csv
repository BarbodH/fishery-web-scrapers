The CO wouldn't have a very large window to get me. And if they did question me I like to think they would understand what I was doing, but who knows."

935670,Raf,2015-09-21 22:56:00,3495,"I didn't think it was a Gbay fish. I'm not sure what the min on the kawarthas is these days, used to be 36"".  Like Wayne said, the CO on southern georgian bay is a real stickler for the rules, especially when it comes to 'his' fish and I can almost guarantee you'd get a ticket out there with an option to take it to the judge.   Who knows who you would get at Lake 'X', maybe they'd be understanding, maybe they wouldn't.  The high minimum limits are put in place exactly for the reason, nobody would keep at 54"" fish.  Congrats, it's a nice fish and must have been a blast out of a canoe on light tackle."
935672,Tom McCutcheon,2015-09-21 23:16:00,627,"First off, nice fish and well done from a canoe. Congratulations. The fact that it probably towed you around a bit on the light tackle rather than you trying to horse it in on light tackle along with the fact that it had time to revive while heading in to the dock likely made it easier to release. The size limit on Balsam and the rest of zone 17 is 44"". Raised from 36"" in 2010. A CO has every right to present you with a ticket, (at his discretion) for not immediately releasing an undersized fish. Just because you only hold it for one photo would not get you out of the ticket with some CO's."
935679,Cloudy15,2015-09-21 23:58:00,141,"I respect that he considers them his fish, and rigorously tries to protect them. I do think we need more people like that. I would just feel bitter as someone that tires to do right by the fishery compared to those I constantly see people blatantly hurt it. But, i do get that I would of been breaking the law and putting the fish to though extra stress. I really needed to have a photo lol  And thanks it was a blast. It never took line until the first time i put my hand on it's tail(Forgot to pack my muskie net in the canoe). It did tow me around a fair bit, and I had an audience of 10-15 people from two separate cottages cheering me on. There was an audible ohh.. when it slapped me in the head with it's tail and knocked my hat into the water,  I never measured it , but i think it would of been over 44?"

938608,lpmaure,2015-10-07 19:59:00,6,"Reporting back on our 23-30 September fishing trip in Georgian Bay/Moon River. There were three of us fishing out of two boats, two of us focused on muskies, the third guy switching around between bass and muskies.  Weather was gorgeous (warm and sunny w/ little wind) until the last day when it rained. We fished Blackstone Harbor 1½ days and caught only small pike - I called it a ""pike nest""- and no action at all around the sunken island. Moon River, both east and west of Woods Bay was also unproductive for muskies, but there was lots of bass and pike action. All our musky action was out in Moon Bay, from the mouth of Captain Allan Strait out to the islands above Loon Island. The muskies we found were out in open water, not very shallow, and most of the time the bottom was flat. They seemed to be relating to small schools of small minnows and presumably were feeding on the other predators chasing the minnows.  We threw topwater, cowgirls, crank baits and spinnerbaits of various sizes and colors. But the only productive musky lure for us was the Shallow Invader in bumblebee pattern (black & yellow). Our catches included a 44 ½"" musky (caught on day 2), 25+ bass (biggest was a 22"" smallmouth), 40+  pike (biggest was 35"").  We lost at least 3 muskies and had 9 follows, most of which were in the 40""+ size. I'll try to post some pics...   "
938611,Gallie,2015-10-07 20:06:00,1215,Nice muskie! Too bad you couldnt corral the rest!
938620,lew,2015-10-07 20:38:00,12766,But the only productive musky lure for us was the Shallow Invader in bumblebee pattern (black & yellow).  Sounds like a fun trip and you managed to raise a few muskies which can be tough on GBay when your not really familiar with the area.  That Bumble Bee color is always productive no matter what bait it is and what water your fishing.

932568,mikeh,2015-09-03 21:09:00,824,"many years ago I used to troll big flatfish on Gbay, one black with silver fleck and one orange and black dots, the catch ratio was something like 7-1 for the black one. the orange one just didn't work for me. I have never fished the moon river, but I'd try around shoals and drop offs, maybe at the ends of channels.  One area of Georgian bay where people ice fish for walleye there is a few musky hanging around , I fish that area all summer. Good luck and make a report when you come back"

Im just saying from personal experience, I fish GB 25+ out of 52 weeks in a year and still have only ever seen one musky.  meanwhile ive fished lower buckhorn 5 times in my entire life and caught a small musky.

Nobody said it was easy and it does take time to figure out large bodies of water, but the fish are there and huge ones too. Maybe get yourself a guide to show you the ropes and help you figure a pattern.  As for Lower Buck, or any of the Kawarthas for that matter, the muskies are a dime a dozen and generally very easy to catch with multiple fish daily a regular occurance."

GB to me is not a place to go to target musky unless you plan on putting in a lot of hours and knowing exactly what you are doing. In my experience people who have spent a long time fishing for musky without making contact with them, especially in the Kawartha, is a result of not fishing close enough to structure. Banging your trolling motor against rocks, stumps, etc, is a common place and is why black paint was invented."

The guy who has caught maybe 500+ muskies already and is seeking a true giant or the next possible world record, rather than just another 42 incher. Since I am still well below 500, I still really enjoy a 42 incher! Crap even a 38 gets me somewhat interested. I hope someday I have more time to fish and caught enough decent fish to change gears and to really seek out that giant. In the meantime though, I want to catch fish so that means the Kawarthas or St. Clair for me."

933717,grimsbylander,2015-09-11 17:27:00,3016,One big fish can be luck but consistency is more science than a crap shoot. The fisherman on this forum that consistently catch musky don't do it because they're lucky.

But it was most likely due to time of year (October long weekend), cold fronts, and turnover.  The one year I was really excited as the weather had been good, water temperature took a massive dive over night, which turned everything off (I did have a Pike follow but that was about it).Having said that - I probably had a Muskie strke in the Bay before Captain Allen's Strait.  Something hit, but I thought it was a snag, or a weed.  When I pulled in 1.5 inches of the plastic tail I was running was missing - sliced off.  Going to guess it was a Muskie that attacked and missed."

I'll leave you folks with another question though.  A lot of replies talked about throwing big baits for muskies, yet the Ontario record was caught on a small Rapala. And that's not the only instance I've seen of bass and walleye size lures catching huge muskies. So my question for you to mull over while I'm gone is, ""Must you use big lures to catch big fish?"" When we haven't caught a fish all day, my brother and I often comment to each other while chucking oversize muskie lures, ""If you're not catching anything, you might as well not be catching anything big!"""

Probably not, if you are targeting other species, I have hooked them on 1/8th ounce spinners baits, jig and pig, and various other bass lures, it never went well.

There's lots of info online on this and as far as what to use exactly, its impossible to say.  They are the fish of 10,000 casts and most hard-core muskie fisherman use many different techniques.

Each 10 to 12 inch fingerling was implanted with a micro chip prior to release.Since 2007, the numbers stand at about 10,000 fingerlings in total reintroduced. Some of these if they survived, should be reaching maturity. There have been incidental catches reported, but no verification (DNA or micro chip number taken) to substantiate if they are indeed from the restocking program.  This past spring several pairs of adult fish were caught in the MNRF traps while surveying for spawning walleye. These unfortunately were found to be Kawartha Strain muskies and not Georgian Bay strain and quite possibly may have migrated in from Balsam. There are a number of volunteers actively looking for these mature fish to hopefully get DNA samples and numbers from the micro chips. I am told that the Fleming Hatchery is at capacity (2 to 3 thousand healthy fingerlings) for release this fall. If you wish to adopt a muskie fingerling you can make a donation by visiting the MCI website.... Adopt A Muskie Program.  And now back to the original post about Moon River."
