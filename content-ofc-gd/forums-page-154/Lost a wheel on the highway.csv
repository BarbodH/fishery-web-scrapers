938249,Gerritt,2015-10-05 01:07:00,6129,Had this happen to a guy I knew years ago.....  Turns out he was scamming the company we were working for..... A credit card scam.  The Russians didn't take to lightly of their gravy train being at its last stop.  On ramp to the 403 at the LINC in Ancaster. Both front wheels fell off...  He was arrested shortly there after.  People can and will do crazy things.  Get locking wheel nuts. Two per wheel.  G
938261,farsider,2015-10-05 02:29:00,456,"Thats scary.  Glad everybody is ok.  Just as an aside.  What torque rating do people torque their lugnuts to?  Cheers, Mark"
938270,DanD,2015-10-05 11:51:00,2223,"generally nothing leaves my bay without being hand torqued first, but the biggie and no matter how many times i say it is all wheels require a retorque after 25 to 100 miles of driving, doesn't take much corrsion or dirt on the mounting surface to make the wheel come loose quickly ans surprisingly about 1 in a 100 customers will return for that retorque  X2!!! We go one step further (especially on aluminum wheels); we clean the mating surfaces of the wheel and the hub with a wire wheel on a hand grinder. You have to get that corrosion off, or it'll powder and the wheel will become loose. Started doing this a number of years ago, when a customer came back after driving at least 200 miles; thinking he had a bad wheel bearing. No the wheel was loose and I had no excuse because I watched my tech zip the wheels up with his gun and then went over them with a torque wrench. It's a sickening feeling, the thought that I/we could have hurt or killed him. Every vehicle no matter how busy we are gets this treatment; knock on wood; I haven't known of another coming loose on us.  Dan."

938313,kickingfrog,2015-10-05 18:51:00,8333,Thanks.  My intent was to give a heads up for anyone parking in the woods whether you're in that area or elsewhere.  The nuts were tightened with a torque wrench and that was 13000 kms ago.  The 4 remaining wheel studs were in perfect shape (threads are not worn) the 5th stud was snapped off.  Each wheel used to have one keyed nut and 4 regular ones.

938079,kickingfrog,2015-10-04 13:30:00,8333,I was hunting the South river area on Friday for grouse and on the way home my front diver's side wheel came off on hwy 11.No injuries and thank goodness no other vehicles were involved. I had let of the throttle has soon as I heard something and we were going much slower than the speed limit when it came off.At this point i don't know how it happened. The last time that wheel had been off the vehicle was in the spring when the summers were put on.Don't know if it was tampered with. Just a heads up if you are out in the woods this fall.

938083,Big Cliff,2015-10-04 13:50:00,6899,Did the hub come off or was it just the tire and rim?
938084,Gallie,2015-10-04 13:53:00,1215,"Wow you are seriously lucky, if that hits a car going the other way its game over."

938090,huzzsaba,2015-10-04 14:21:00,884,"Glad everyone is fine.  To add to the rest of the advice is to check the lug nuts/bolts after getting the car back from the mechanics.  A lot of time they will forget to torque them down.  I always redo mine when I bring the car back from the shop with a torque wrench. Sometimes shops wont tighten them enough, and sometime they will over tighten them!  Could be a honest mistake, but its not them that will suffer when the wheels fall off.  Back in the days, my dad got his brakes done at a well known shop in Montreal. He drove to toronto the same day and upon reaching, he told me he kept hearing a weird sound.  I check the wheels and I was literally able to spin the lug nuts with my fingers.  Scary!"

Same with me, every time I take the truck in for regular  maintenance they pull the wheels to check the brakes but when I get home I loosen them off and re-torque them."

938163,kickingfrog,2015-10-04 19:59:00,8333,Just spent the afternoon going over it with a mechanic. Everything points to tampering. I've just decided on a new spot during the big game seasons. I'll also be bringing some game cameras as well. Haven't decided on whether or not my brother and I will be sitting in the woods watching with a couple more cameras.

I had just had new tires installed, and they didnt torque the wheel nuts. I was also lucky nobody was hurt, and my tire flew off the shoulder into a field, rather than unto oncoming traffic. It rolled almost a km before it came to a stop!!  S"
938178,porkpie,2015-10-04 20:24:00,2521,"Scumbags.  They could kill someone.  I once had a ""hunter"" slash 2 of my tires many years ago in a county forest for hunting ""his spot"". I'd far rather that than loosened wheelnuts.  At least the guy who did me in didn't try to kill me."
