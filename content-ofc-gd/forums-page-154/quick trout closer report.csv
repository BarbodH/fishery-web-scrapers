Like the rest of the month, the weather was absolutely gorgeous, and the water was still 63-65 degrees on the surface.  The upwind side of the lake had notably colder water and was holding the vast majority of the trout not surprisingly.  Fish were still glued to the bottom in 50-65 FOW and we picked off 4 good trout to fill our limits on flutter spoons behind 3,oz bouncers trolled slowly.  It was a nice way to cap things off, even though I still do a fair amount of splake and rainbow fishing well into the fall.  Here's some photos...cheers      "

If you have any tips for fall splake, feel free to share. Was going to go this weekend, but I feel like I've been hit by a Mack truck of a cold and probably won't be up for it now. Maybe next weekend."
937911,Joeytier,2015-10-03 01:42:00,3990,I'd wait a few more weeks.  I don't usually go out for splake until after thanksgiving.
