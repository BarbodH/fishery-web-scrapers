First drift in, hook a giant steel, pops off 2 minutes into the fight, a couple cohos and 50 boots later. A brown decides to come out and play, now I'm pumped, next drift, another brown, was an incredible evening, first time successfully landing 2 lake run browns in one outing! Was a great time out with a bud, except for all the dang zombies swimming around, making things a little more challenging and frustrating. A couple pics of the browns:"
938322,AKRISONER,2015-10-05 20:04:00,5558,jeez those are some big browns bud nice work
938339,BowSlayer101,2015-10-05 21:41:00,296,Thanks man!
938341,Steve,2015-10-05 21:46:00,2075,"browns are such a great fish....  you should email those to Chris Robinson, remind him of the awesome angling opportunity they provide...."
938342,Gallie,2015-10-05 21:48:00,1215,Sweet browns dude! Good work!
938492,aplumma,2015-10-06 23:08:00,6896,Very cool thanks for the story and pictures.   Art
938495,MCTFisher9120,2015-10-06 23:27:00,3761,Nice! Beauty's for sure still can't get onto a brown to save my life. Maybe next spring.
938496,Steve,2015-10-06 23:29:00,2075,"Mike, browns are the pike of the lake/stream.  They eat anything and everything.  You have to find them....once you have, they are very easy to catch."
938507,BowSlayer101,2015-10-07 00:41:00,296,"Thanks for the kind words guys! As for getting them, I'd have to disagree with the above comment, browns aren't easy to hook into in rivers well at least for me and everyone I know, lakes are a different story. It took me a couple years to land my first brown, the trick is to find unpreassured waters, which is hard to do in our area. This is why I like to go at night, not many anglers around and fish are less spooked. Browns also love flies, my go to for them is aa glow bead and fly combo."
938518,Steve,2015-10-07 01:07:00,2075,"nah, you just have to irritate a brown....  too many folks think they are a light biter, that requires subtle presentations.  a kwikfish, j9, or other form of moving bait will get a brown to go...especially if there is stain to the water.  try a bagley small fry next time your striking out on browns. you'll be surprised. They are the apex trout predator.  also, like you mentioned, they are nocturnal feeders, especially in clear water. I caught a brown fishing frog water in lower bronte sections on a popper, while fishing smallies. a popper, lol."
938520,Steve,2015-10-07 01:09:00,2075,"i should clarify, i'm referring to lake run browns, not natural stream browns."
938527,BowSlayer101,2015-10-07 02:25:00,296,"I'll definitely try some of the Bagley small fry lures next time, thanks for the tip! And ya ive heard the browns are crazy in the west end, gonna have to plan a trip down there for them."
938529,Steve,2015-10-07 02:29:00,2075,"niagara river to hamilton is the best brown trout fishing in Ontario.  March 1 to June 1st is the best time....  then again when the alewives come into the harbours to spawn. (usually mid to end of june)  with the collapse of salmon in lake ontario, I think more of us are going to start targetting browns.  we also get them casting hamilton harbour from september to january."
938547,BillM,2015-10-07 11:58:00,17367,Early season browns off planner boards and long leads are a riot.
