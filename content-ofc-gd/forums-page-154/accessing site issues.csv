907350,aplumma,2015-03-31 22:38:00,6896,We turned off the ads to show that it is not our site. As soon as we turn the ads back on  APB will react with our ads and we will return back to an issue.  Just a note also that APB works differently in each browsers which is why it will filter Chrome and lets IE thru.   So we can ask T.J. to turn off the 4 ads we have and run out of money in about 3 weeks or thank everyone for turning off  APB and help fund this site and keep it open. I prefer to say thank you to everyone myself.      Art
907352,lew,2015-03-31 22:45:00,12766,  https://youtu.be/EmAAaXI8riY       Outstanding LOL
907356,OhioFisherman,2015-03-31 23:04:00,6623,"I also couldn't get on for a few days, I even emailed Deg to see if he knew of a problem. All I would see was a bare skin of the page with little or no text, once I disabled ABP ad blocker plus on Firefox the problem went away."
907357,misfish,2015-03-31 23:09:00,29133, Outstanding LOL  The song or the
907361,Locnar,2015-03-31 23:22:00,645,Mine is now working.
907363,icefisherman,2015-03-31 23:35:00,952,"Hallelujah!!! Working fine now. Thanks for fixing it. Writing this in Chrome. First time for a week to be able to post from Chrome.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
907365,Lape0019,2015-03-31 23:36:00,647, And what is up with the Russian brides? Is that spam or did the admin decide that was a good thing to advertise. I get a kick out of it everytime I see it!
907368,TJQ,2015-03-31 23:52:00,7806,LOL.. those are the ads that google likes to serve us I guess...
907377,Raf,2015-04-01 00:24:00,3495,Teksavvy (my isp) must have inherited an ip block that is either banned on OFC or part of a broader IPB filter used here.  A dhcp renew didnt give me a new ip so it looks like i am stuck for now
938779,FloatnFly,2015-10-09 01:10:00,1640,"Have tried several different ad blockers from different places, and same result from all of them, me thinks there might be a sniffer line in the coding that detects ad blocking software, and does not allow the content to load  also as a suggestion, maybe setup a donate button, and then one day in the future, this site can truely be ad free"
907287,Roy,2015-03-31 18:47:00,13728,"The latest I have right now is that according to IPB, the most likely cause is a change in Ad Blocker's software."
907288,Raf,2015-03-31 18:56:00,3495,"ok that is the adblocker issue  but can you please check to see if my IP is banned LOL!! my issue is separate (and the fact that I am writing this, goes to show how useless IP blocking is.)"
907289,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 18:59:00,11391,Sorry Raf you are banned!???  Too many musky pics
907296,Roy,2015-03-31 19:37:00,13728,"All's clear here, Raf. IP addresses are active, email and username is active. No blemishes on your record whatsoever. Congratulation!"
907301,Raf,2015-03-31 19:55:00,3495,"Roy, this is what I am seeing, the IP address I am trying to access the site from is 23.233.xx.xx  "
907302,TJQ,2015-03-31 20:08:00,7806,"I had someone complain about that as well a few days ago.. same screen shot from an non member trying to lurk,...  its seems that if your not logged in and running ad blocker its not letting you view a page.  Its definitely an adblocker issue as the Google ads are not showing up where they would normally be.   Personally I think that if the ads are what keeps the site going you should turn your ad blocker off..  imho.  lol  Its quite possible there may be nothing we can do about it."
907306,Raf,2015-03-31 20:10:00,3495,the adblocker is off TJ you can make out the luremaking.com ad.  i'm having the same issue regardless of which browser I try.. IE (gasp) has never even had a blocker installed.
907308,TJQ,2015-03-31 20:16:00,7806,Hmmmmmm  ...  Guess I'm gonna have to install; adblocker...  uhhg.. lol..  heres a question if you change to the earthbound theme does it do the same thing??
907310,Raf,2015-03-31 20:18:00,3495,"It won't let me change themes either.  same error message.  There is one more possibility that you have clued me into here TJ (lightbulb went off).. DNS spoofing service also does adblocking.  Gonna see if I can disable that temporarily.  edit: disabled it, the charming russian brides are back.. but same error msg.  "
907313,Raf,2015-03-31 20:25:00,3495,the really odd part is when I use my phone as a hotspot and access from the same PC I get in fine.  which makes me believe it's my IP address that is the culprit.
907314,vance,2015-03-31 20:32:00,719,Raf I have had the same issue before and after I deleted all my cookies and rebooted the computer I was good to go and I have no idea which fixed it.  vance
907315,Terry,2015-03-31 20:33:00,14456,yup  it's ip related
907320,Locnar,2015-03-31 20:49:00,645,On IE it works fine... Chrome is doesn't work at all with adblock on or off.
907326,TJQ,2015-03-31 21:01:00,7806,I made a change to the table on the top last week....  i put it back to the way it was... has this solved the isuue for anyone??
907327,aplumma,2015-03-31 21:04:00,6896,still an issue on both 7 and 8 T.J.   Art
907328,Terry,2015-03-31 21:05:00,14456,it did not change anything   but Rafs problem is a different issue the the ad issue
907330,TJQ,2015-03-31 21:07:00,7806,Ok... well its not that!   Good to know.
907331,misfish,2015-03-31 21:07:00,29133,"A while back,I had what Raf had,but it went away magically?????  The only problem I have is youtube links will not work like they use too. I can only post links."
907332,misfish,2015-03-31 21:08:00,29133,HI BOSS. LOL
907333,aplumma,2015-03-31 21:10:00,6896,yup Raf has figured out how to self ban himself. Still trying to see if we can get him back .
907335,aplumma,2015-03-31 21:16:00,6896,Raf try powering down your modem and let it reset it will clear your ip address and possible a new address. if this fails contact your server and ask if they have a different ip they can manually set.  Art
907338,icefisherman,2015-03-31 21:32:00,952,"Don't think the problem is with the AB... I am not touching my AB and when I use IE bamm no problem visiting the site....With exact same settings and not changing anything I try Chrome and it doesn't allow me access....all I see is the very top of the site. Nothing below the top six button bellow the Ontario Fishing Community sign.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
907343,Ralph Field,2015-03-31 22:18:00,1018,I'm now able to access the site without pausing ad blocker using chrome !
907344,Terry,2015-03-31 22:23:00,14456,yup firefox with ad blocker on now working
907345,lew,2015-03-31 22:24:00,12766,Now working  for me too with Chrome.
906766,Raf,2015-03-29 13:48:00,3495,Perhaps an ip filter?  Can only access via phone.  If i connect phone to home wifi then no joy.  If y'all wanna get rid of me just ssay so.
906767,Gerritt,2015-03-29 13:54:00,6129,"Raf, no problems here in my phone, on wifi. Or tablet....  Perhaps a ban was placed on the IP block you are currently on?  Reset your modem to pickup a new IP addy... Hopefully it will pick one up outside that block.  G"
906768,Musky or Specks,2015-03-29 14:09:00,2710,Me too for some reason can't access from my home computer but work computer is fine. Keep that on the down low. I'm at work and my boss says.. oh wait I'm the only one here.
906769,MJL,2015-03-29 14:14:00,2427,Are you using Adblock on your browser?  I wasn't able to view the site for the last number of days until my dad recommended I try turning off Firefox's adblock for OFC. I disabled it for this site and it works as normal (except with ads).
906770,Raf,2015-03-29 14:18:00,3495,I get you are not allowed to visit this community.  Pretty sure its an ip ban like gerrit said.  Tried with and without adblock.  If i use phone as hotspot and connect that way all is good.  You are all blocking a huge teksavvy block if this is the case.  23.233.xxx.xxx
906772,huzzsaba,2015-03-29 14:32:00,884,"same issue here.  home computer I couldn't access the site and same at my bro in laws place.   At work, it is fine"
906777,Musky or Specks,2015-03-29 14:35:00,2710,When I get home I'll turn off the adblock but it's always been on and never been an issue before.
906796,esoxansteel,2015-03-29 16:13:00,1307,cannot access through outlook but msn is fine
906798,Terry,2015-03-29 16:46:00,14456,cannot access through outlook but msn is fine don't know what that means msn is a group of websites outlook is a mail client
906867,Raf,2015-03-29 20:11:00,3495,"ok there are two issues as far as i can see.  1) my ip address appears to be blocked  2) the brown/default skin appears to not work with adblock  I had to search for the button to change skin, found it, changed to mobile and now I can see but not while using my own IP address."
907177,Locnar,2015-03-31 02:43:00,645,I have problems accessing this site using Google Chrome lately... but internet explorer seems to work. I wish it were the other way around...
907198,aplumma,2015-03-31 11:26:00,6896,We have work tickets in on these issues they are in the base site not from changes we have made to the board.  If you are having an issue please post it here and tell us as much detail as you can and we will pass it on.  Thank you   Art
907217,Ralph Field,2015-03-31 13:29:00,1018,"I have the same problem using chrome and have found the solution to the problem. The administrators to this site have decided that you will not be able to view this site if you use ad blocker as the sponsors ads are hidden. Didn't use to be this way, but now to view this site you must pause ad blocker. When you are finished engage ad blocker and go to the next forum."
907219,Gerritt,2015-03-31 13:39:00,6129,"The administrators of this site have stated they have done no such thing. They have made no changes that would affect this, they have also stated they are working with IPB towards a solution.  To accuse admin of this site for something they have publicly announced is not within their control is in bad taste in my opinion.  G"
907221,irishfield,2015-03-31 13:42:00,26272,"Thanks Art! Can you get them to look at the inability to quote in IE as well while they're in there... if not no big deal, there are ways around it."
907231,Gerritt,2015-03-31 13:57:00,6129,"Mobile skin option has disappeared, sometimes I switch back and forth from the classic to the mobile skin on my cell phone( mobile skin doesn't give all the functions the main skin does)  but now it is gone... The mobile skin saves us mobile users a TON in bandwidth costs the cell companies charge.... just an FYI  G"
907232,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 13:59:00,11391,"I had a seperate thread about that gerritt. Its there you just cant see it. There is an orange icon bottom left hand of the page, click just to the right of that icon to change the skin"
907235,Raf,2015-03-31 14:03:00,3495,THank you Art.
907236,Gerritt,2015-03-31 14:08:00,6129,Your right! It is there.... It's invisable though... Same colour as the background... lol thanks Rick!
907239,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 14:16:00,11391,No prob Gerritt!

907286,aplumma,2015-03-31 18:44:00,6896,I just reverted a copy of ad blocker and it worked fine on the site. After updating it the site on my computer went back to having issues. While IPB is checking on there end to make sure they have no bugs in the closet it appears (in my untrained thought process) that it is the software of the adblocker that has changed and conflicting with the site. I have another site that is also not compatible with the new adblocker download. I will forward this to Roy to send to IPB.   Art
