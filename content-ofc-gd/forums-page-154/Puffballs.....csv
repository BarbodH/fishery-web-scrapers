Shaped like a small cow patty but full of ridges and valleys. I left it there. Cliff, now I'm confused. Is it 1/2 cup or 1/4 cup of dried puffball you add to that soup? You mentioned both.  Cheers"

937352,Gerritt,2015-09-30 14:14:00,6129,Croutons are of the devil....... I dont buy or eat bad bread.

938858,smitty55,2015-10-09 22:47:00,928,"Well I finally got a good sized puffball. Unfortunately a lot of small worms had made their home in it, so I lost almost half of it after trimming. All of it went into the 8 trays of my dehydrator and it did work well. Almost weightless very brittle pieces were the result. Looking forward to trying them in my next soup. Would like to find one more for sure.   Btw all the pieces are chalk white, there's just some shadows in the pic. Cliff I'm wondering if you have a preference in how small you break them up and what the texture is like after adding them to soups. Tks  Cheers"
938859,pics,2015-10-09 22:53:00,1268,I found them by the hundreds up where we bow hunt for moose.. all small with the biggest about the size of a ping pong ball. Traveling behind another atv resulted in facefulls of green dust from the mature ones..

Cliff I'm wondering if you have a preference in how small you break them up and what the texture is like after adding them to soups. Tks  Cheers I usually just crumble them by putting them in a zip lock bag, close it, remove as much air as you can,  then breaking them up with my hands (I found this was the cleanest and easiest way to do it) a lot of it will go right down to powder.  Sometimes I end up with some chunks about the size of peas or a little bigger. They never really ""desolve"" into the soup or stew although the powder stuff blends in very well the chunks will rehydrate to some degree the texture will be that of a well cooked mushroom. In a mushroom soup I like the chunks, in a gravy I use the powder. Just remember, 1/4 cup of the dehydrated stuff is = to about two or three of those chunks you started with.  Hope this helps!"
938918,smitty55,2015-10-10 15:47:00,928,Thanks Cliff.I'm going to vacuum seal some of it as well and then I can break it down as needed.  Cheers

Perhaps Cliff is right..... Too early and as others has suggested too dry. But I was collecting at this time last year so I gave it a shot.....  I'll keep walking in the meantime....  On a side note I dropped about 40kgs of apples for the deer from my apple tree..... Only 100+ to pick and take out back..  G

If you cut them or twist it just right and leave the root you can get several  of them of the same root. That big one Smiity had would cut up and get $12 for it."

When it comes to eating, the primary commandment for me is to enjoy it asap after picking. Under 12 inches is best. Big ones get shared if I can, or I'll leave them to mature, specially if there's only one.  With steak of course .  Cooling slows the process some what, but it doesn't take long to start yellowing. I've frozen raw chunks and even tried freezing quick fried slabs. Meh...  This could be on the cooking thread, but it's on topic so here goes lol...  Maybe here, or OOD  or Hank Shaw even, I came across a post on dehydrating giant puffball. I am so gonna do it if I'm lucky this year. I'll likely then lightly smoke some of it too, if I get enough. Then I can even customize a mix if I want. You then grind/process and end up with a very unique and quite versatile gem. As a thickener and/or flavor enhancer for stews, gravies and sauces,soups, casseroles, even stir fry or breading. Sounds tantilizing. I'm sure hoping to get my fall treat this year.  Klinker you folks have it made down there. Even summertime. Good for you. I've never even heard of finding puffball at a farmers market. Must have dedicated customers and lots of farms.  T'is the time of the season for sure. Good luck Gerrit. At least you know where they normally are. That's the main thing by far.  Cheers"
936597,Big Cliff,2015-09-26 07:14:00,6899,"I have been dehydrating them for many years now and it is a super way to preserve them for later use in soups and stews, I always add about 1/2 a cup when I make a pot (about 4 servings) of my French onion soup and everyone loves it!"
936620,smitty55,2015-09-26 15:27:00,928,Good to know Cliff. It was probably your post I saw then. How fine do you grind it and how thin do you cut it for dehydrating? Tks.  Cheers

Cheers Slice it about 1/2"" thich once it is dehydrated it crumbles quite well, I've never ground it. Store it in a zip lock bag and just squeeze out as much air as you can, it will keep for years."
