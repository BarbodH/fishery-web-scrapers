938402,farsider,2015-10-06 02:41:00,456,"A cougar came into town and amazingly, wasn't killed.  I hope the MNR/Police are taking notes.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cougar-tranquillized-near-b-c-legislature-in-victoria-1.3256866  Cheers, Mark"
938403,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-06 02:50:00,10439,We have had them in town up here too. They have never had to tranq or shoot one that I know of. They have shut down parks they were frequenting though. There have been bears shot in town as they don't want to risk tranqing them and having them injure someone before the drugs take effect. We had a lynx run over by a car downtown one winter and early one winter morning I saw a wolverine waling up my street!!!
938428,bare foot wader,2015-10-06 14:26:00,1354,"It wasn't killed simply because it hadn't attacked anybody or pets yet, if it had, it would certainly be a different outcome. Most of the cats than encroaching on urban developments tend to be younger cats and not typically the best of health, struggling to survive on their own. Sadly, once these cats realize there are easy snacks within city limits, they become problem animals and are killed.  Relocation of predators is not as successful as many would like to believe. But it's still nice to read a happy story now and then."
938447,Big Cliff,2015-10-06 18:09:00,6899,"Saddly I think we have become a KILL society, we have to be in control! When I lived in French River we frequently saw bears around the house, (we lived out in the middle of nowhere). We didn't run for a gun (well perhaps once or twice because we wanted meat for the freezer  )  Why do we have to kill everything that we don't understand?  I was so happy when I saw that this poor cat got another chance!"
938452,bare foot wader,2015-10-06 19:08:00,1354,cougar is quite similar to pork
938516,Muskieman,2015-10-07 01:06:00,2472,"Unfortunately , I'm not a cut copy paste pro , but my buddy caught one on video in Marten River Ontario yesterday while out cruising for Moose and Birds , he has it on his FB and a copy was sent to MNR for verification."
938581,IndySKS,2015-10-07 17:38:00,134,I would be really interested in seeing that video.
938593,manitoubass2,2015-10-07 19:03:00,11391,Ive seen four cougars in my life.  All in the last ten years.  They are following easy prey IMO  Beautiful and stealthy animals!
938594,Muskieman,2015-10-07 19:07:00,2472,"Seen them too , going back to when I was a kid, to 2012 no more than 200yds from a packed public beach on Canada Day."
938597,manitoubass2,2015-10-07 19:24:00,11391,"Im surprised you seen them( even like i did)  I know they are all around here.  But they are super stealthy and unless sick or injured, imo they stay away from humans.  Just my experience"
938598,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-07 19:24:00,10439,"We had one in our back yard in Grand Valley in the winter 1996 or 1997. FYI Lynx have stubby little tails like docked Rotweillers. OH, and they have those pointy bits of hair on the tips of their ears.  "
938600,Muskieman,2015-10-07 19:36:00,2472,Your opinions on the video ?
938603,manitoubass2,2015-10-07 19:45:00,11391,Imo thats a cougar
938605,manitoubass2,2015-10-07 19:47:00,11391,Lynx or no bigger then a dog
938607,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-07 19:49:00,10439,"Imo thats a cougar  Yep, tails way too long to be a lynx."
938622,lew,2015-10-07 20:44:00,12766,Thanks for posting that video Randy and could you please let us know the opinion of MNR when your bud hears back from them.
938623,Muskieman,2015-10-07 20:52:00,2472,"Will do , it's also been sent to Science North , they'll deploy a team to investigate ."
938631,Big Cliff,2015-10-07 21:28:00,6899,That is no bobcat!
938633,Muskieman,2015-10-07 21:44:00,2472,Shared again for the second pagers. . https://www.facebook.com/jason.pitre.547/videos/614393022031915/
938635,Beavertail,2015-10-07 21:52:00,331,"Jeez, that's hard to tell tell for sure from that video, especially on my iPhone.  It's grainy and far away but a Lynx gets my vote."
938636,irishfield,2015-10-07 21:58:00,26272,"Video is so blurry all I can see is darkness between it's hind quarters leading you to believe it's a tail. Probably big old momma lynx, but who knows.. I know there are definite confirmed cougar sightings in Temagami. It's not much bigger than the lynx that sat down beside Leah and I a few years back while in the hot tub on our island."
938638,Muskieman,2015-10-07 22:04:00,2472,"Wayne , first ones I seen were right beside the little variety store on the ski trail in Temagami North , momma and her kits , back in the summer of '80 or so . They're around for sure . Beaver , it is grainy , but it does appear to have a tail."
938642,bare foot wader,2015-10-07 22:16:00,1354,"definitely not a cougar, aside from the possible tail, everything else is characteristic of a lynx, I don't think the tail is actually all that long as irishfield mentioned...you can see the black tip moving at one point and is shorter, the rest looks like shadow effect from poor lighting...you can see the shadow effect on the chest too"
938648,irishfield,2015-10-07 22:59:00,26272,A Lynx can be a pretty big cat.. .and sits down exactly like the one in the video.    
938656,Beavertail,2015-10-08 00:33:00,331,"It does appear to have a tail in the video, but to me it looks like a short one. Like Barefoot stated the shadow might give the illusion of a longer one. But even the ""shadow"" tail wouldn't be long enough for a cougar tail. Even its gait looks Lynx to me."
