938772,Smokercrafty,2015-10-09 00:46:00,227,"Omg!!!!   Off to emerg he goes!  Geezzz..... I've have my share of hook jabs, but that one looks almost scary!"
938774,manitoubass2,2015-10-09 01:00:00,11391,"Seen that on pete mainas fb  Damn, painkillers needed (your not pushing that one through)  Thats beyond gnarly"
938775,Gerritt,2015-10-09 01:00:00,6129,It'll buff right out......
938777,sleepjigging,2015-10-09 01:05:00,207,The red in the middle of the bucktail is blood? Hope you had the good bolt cutters for muskies so the hook can be pushed out through the point.
938782,chris.brock,2015-10-09 01:21:00,4053," No, don't push it through, give it a quick tug out, I don't think Mike is going to use this, this surprisingly didn't hurt at all, and yeah I'm a baby  "
938784,manitoubass2,2015-10-09 01:48:00,11391,Chris that not your skull lol  But yes ive done the same as you with smaller hooks a few times  Look at my sons near miss?   
938787,Gallie,2015-10-09 01:53:00,1215,Ouch
938789,Rizzo,2015-10-09 01:57:00,4754,cringe....and that's why I troll when I have newbie's on board. Back in my pike days one of my yahoo buddies beened my off the forehead with a 5 o diamonds. That was bad enough
938817,KLINKER,2015-10-09 15:26:00,256,YYyuup  nothing like a lure brushing your face to make it trolling time.
938821,kickingfrog,2015-10-09 15:57:00,8333,Could he smell burnt toast?
938822,muskymatt,2015-10-09 16:02:00,2608,"That's why I like my 20' boat so there is some distance in between me and the other guy lol That said I still got smacked with a bait, luckily no penetration!"
938829,Beavertail,2015-10-09 17:32:00,331,Too funny!!
938831,lew,2015-10-09 18:01:00,12766,"About 10 years ago a group of us from this board got together for a friendly little musky tournament.  I'd never actually met my partner till the day of the tourney and 15 minutes after we started fishing he made a mighty 2 handed cast but forgot to hit the thumb bar, the bait swung around and he clubbed me in the back of the head with a 7"" solid wood musky bait called a Wakemaker.  If you can imagine getting hit with a baseball bat, that's what it felt like and I saw stars for an hour. Luckily the big 7/0 hooks missed my scalp and the pain wasn't nearly as bad as you'd think.  He felt terrible...obviously...but it was an accident and within a few minutes we were laughing about it.  Best part though, was I went on to win the tourney and pocketed $50 for my troubles and that made it all worthwhile   "
938836,kickingfrog,2015-10-09 18:55:00,8333,Someone I fish with a lot got a hook close to the brain as well....    ... When he sat down on his own lure.   My job:  1. Stop laughing  2. Get camera and take picture  3. Remove hooks
938893,Joey,2015-10-10 03:20:00,9122,"Ah, it's just a flesh wound, I've had worse"
938895,Freshtrax,2015-10-10 03:39:00,2215,Had to cut one out of my dads hand last weekend or it would have ended the trip a few days early.   Not pleasant.
938972,npt1,2015-10-10 23:30:00,220,"I was on a fly in trip with 3 other buddies, one of them got stuck with a treble hook right into his thumb behind the thumb nail, buried to the hilt. I will never forget the sound of ripping tissue when we yanked the hook out with pliers back at camp. He had a few shots of liquid courage but he said it still hurt like h**l. It was our last day in so we flew out the next day, thank goodness we had a first aid kit with cleaning and disinfecting fluids."
