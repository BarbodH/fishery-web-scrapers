I am a former agent with them as well and know how to work them over for the plans etc.  My questions for the forum are: 1) If you were getting another cell phone and wanted GPS on it as well, is the cell phone version of GPS accurate enough in marking favourite fishing locations ?  2) Within how many feet of the target are they accurate?  Thanks Splashhopper"
