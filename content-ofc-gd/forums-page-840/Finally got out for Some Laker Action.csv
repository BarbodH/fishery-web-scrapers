346659,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-05-31 22:11:00,1362,It's been a while since I've made a post so here's a start of hopefully many more to come  I finally had the chance to get out for some Laker action today after spending last weekend opener at home spreading a tandem load of topsoil around the property top dressing the lawn and making a new perennial garden for the wife....  Left the house at 3:00AM to go meet a buddy and it was windy from the get go ...we had a great sunrise and the weather looked promising with nice clear blue skies but got worse as the day went on!!...we went 2 for 7 and were lucky to get the 2 as a cold front moved in....drove home in a brutal hail storm around noon...  Here's some pics...      The season has only just begun  ....and....Muskie season here on the Ottawa is just around the corner
346766,fishboy,2009-06-01 03:19:00,550,beautiful looking fish-congrats!  any hints on how deep and the water temp?
346796,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-06-01 10:58:00,1362, Thanks!!  Water temp was 57F and the fish were scattered...they started heading into deeper water as the cold front moved in....I caught this one at 75' in 170FOW and caught a smaller one at 40'..
