They have a small ""propeller"" at the rear of the lure...(I know!! Lots of them do!) BUT the difference is that when the propeller turns...the long black wire legs MOVE ALSO!! Can't find anything on the web. Was wondering if anyone can identify them, as there are no markins on them. He said he got themk in the US but can't remember where.  Can only add 2 photos as that is max size. allowed but you will get the idea. Hopefully I uploaded then correctly.  Thanks for ANY info!  FT  "

346846,johnnyb,2009-06-01 13:46:00,3413,Looks like something Fred Arbogast would have concocted is my initial guess....possibly something from the Heddon corp...
347049,Fishn Technishn,2009-06-01 22:25:00,198,I too thought maybe Arbogast or Heddon but I can't find anything about them on any of those types of sites. Still looking on the web but nothing so far. Surely SOMEONE has seen 1 or something similar!  FT
