346673,muskymatt,2009-05-31 23:00:00,2608,I am doing some boat mods and have several pcs of bare aluminum that I am goint to need painting. All the info I get off the internet have a five stage chemical process to paint it....My question is..  Does anyone have any experience with painting aluminum???....Maybe a paint product that they know of that can eliminate this process.  I have had aluminum anodized for work in the recent past but it's $$$$ and would like to avoid it if possible.   Thanks
