Lots of people launch out of goreski's and fish that part of the lake... so I'm assuming it's pretty good Is it suitable for me to go there, park and unload a canoe and head off? Is there a fee? Parking? Never been there, but always good to try new places. How is the boat traffic? I'm hoping there won't be much since it's a weekday.  Sunny in the afternoon with variable cloudiness in the evening. High of 16 degrees Celcius and winds of 5 km/h... sounds like a perfect day to bring the canoe out and try for some crappie/walleye.  Thanks in advance."

347084,ccmtcanada,2009-06-01 23:44:00,7971,You can launch a canoe there no problem at all.  Not sure what they charge for it...but to launch my boat it costs 10 bucks.  Launch is concrete and in good shape.  Great protected bay just outside of the marina there.  Good luck if you decide to try it.

I don`t know what the parking situation is though.  If you want to launch in the park they will charge you."
347103,frozen-fire,2009-06-02 00:10:00,542,Thanks guys... I guess either way I'll give it a shot. You'll see a report
347153,ccmtcanada,2009-06-02 01:24:00,7971, Looking forward to it...I've pulled everything from panfish to walleye to muskie from close to Goreskis...good luck!
