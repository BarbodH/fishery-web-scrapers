Sydney and I saw Sue last week, but we hadn't seen Big Cliff in quite a while, so we were looking forward to this trip.  We arrived at the lake around 930 in the morning and saw Big Cliff working out in his garage, so we stopped to say hello before hitting the lake.  It was good to catch up a little before launching the boat.  The winds weren't horrible, but not great either, so finding good drifts to jig for those walleye was a little challenging.  We did find some nice weed edges and drop offs to fish, so we were hoping for a little luck.  Bly managed a few little ones....   Sydney put her bobber away and wanted to jig like mom and dad...she's had a pretty good feel for it and managed lots of panfish...   Another few more pics...       I didn't manage any walleye, but a certain large species of the green and long kind ended up on my hook...released boat side quickly without any pictures...can't wait for the season to open for those monsters!  Around mid afternoon, Sydney really wanted to see Big Cliff again, so we headed over to his dock.  Luckily he was pretty much done his work for the day so we got a chance to sit and talk.  Sue came back a little while later, and Sydney headed to the dock to do some more fishing.   Bly ended up with a few small keeper sized fish, so we brought them home for a little snack.   Anyhow, we'll be headed back to Sturgeon many more times this season...with great fishing and great people on this lake, how can you resist?"
