346787,rbaquial,2009-06-01 05:59:00,968,Never heard/seen of them before.... but would love to give them a try... How much do these JACKALL and EVERGREEN lures go for anyway?  Website?

346930,bigreddog,2009-06-01 17:14:00,84,"I think OFC member Snidley also sells lures from Evergreen and Jackall as well.  Check the classifieds:   	 23 Lucky craft, 7 MegaBass plus 48 other Japanese fishinglures for sale  I've never dealt with him myself, but I'm sure there are many other OFC'ers who can vouch for him."
346993,singingdog,2009-06-01 19:23:00,1047," I will vouch for him...great guy to deal with and a definite lure junkie.  A2F: Evergreen and Jackall are like LuckyCraft, only more so. Expect to pay 25+ for hardbaits from either company."
