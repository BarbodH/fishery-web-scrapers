346688,brifishrgy,2009-05-31 23:49:00,559,Looking at taking my son camping next weekend .. looking to go somewhere we haven't been before .. has anyone been to Wheatley before?? .. is there a boat launch close by? .. I am not familiar with the area at all so any fishing tips would be great too .. thanks
346692,Sandbag,2009-05-31 23:53:00,533,Not sure about the local boat launch other than the Colchester area a little farther along.  There are a few inland ponds within the park that hold lots of catfish.  Cheers  Craig
346724,brifishrgy,2009-06-01 01:37:00,559,Thanks sandbag .. I will be sure to bring some catfish stuff with me .. hoping to get out in the big lake for some eyes if its not too breezy

346816,Dnthmn,2009-06-01 12:21:00,128,A fifteen minute drive west puts you in Leamington. There is a very well maintained marina and if you head back east a little once you get into the big lake there is usually some really good fishing in front of the golf course.
