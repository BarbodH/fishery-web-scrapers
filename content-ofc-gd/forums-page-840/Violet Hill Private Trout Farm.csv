347345,MSBruno,2009-06-02 13:47:00,369,I was driving along Hwy 89 this morning and drove past Mono 2nd line EHS and I remeber fishing this man's pond which he stocked with trout and he allowed the public to fish and he charged by the inch for every fish caught.  Is this place still open?

347401,MSBruno,2009-06-02 16:25:00,369, The place I am referring to is not Primrose.  Primrose is 5km east of this place.
