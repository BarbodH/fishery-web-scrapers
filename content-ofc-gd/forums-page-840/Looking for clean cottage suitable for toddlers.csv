If the cottage has access to a sand beach nearby, that would be great.  There will be 4 children between the ages of 11 months and 4 years, so some safe interesting things to do for toddlers would be great.  If they have a ramp and dock for my boat great, if not, as long as there is a ramp nearby that is fine.  I guess I am emphasizing clean because last year I rented a private place on Six Mile, and the place wasn't totally disgusting, but there was a big mouse living under the main couch and it was unhealthy looking enough that I ended up bringing my daughter back home and driving back up myself - the person I was with camped in a tent as they were in it for the Survivor aspect.  As far as fishing cabins go, I've definitely stayed in much worse and I would stay there again myself, but I guess I should've been more selective knowing I was bringing a 1.5 year old with me.  Don't really have any lake preference or species preference.  If there's some rock bass near the docks, perfect.  Thanks."

We usually end up going for a 3 or 4 bedroom cottage just to get the most space."

People there are very nice and so far, we're happy having our trailer there."
