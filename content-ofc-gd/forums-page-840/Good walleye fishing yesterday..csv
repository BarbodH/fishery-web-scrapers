346597,limeyangler,2009-05-31 17:19:00,5204,"Hi all,   Got the call at about 9am from Lew....""wanna go fishing at my cabin today?"".........like I always say when asked if i wanna go fishing....""are there bubbles when a duck farts?""  So after getting a few things done, i got to Lew's about an hour late at 1pm, he was gracious about my lateness, but gave me some stick about it....lol...oooops.  Picked up Lew's dad Alex, got some minnows and headed an hour north of Dryden to the small lake where his cabin is located. Access is a small trail through the bush to where his boat is stashed on the shore, then a short 1/2 mile across the lake to his cabin. Good fun just getting into some of these places...and easier since Lew got his new Arctic Cat 4x4, especially not having to carry the outboard!    GOT THERE AROUND 2PM       SHORT TRAIL THROUGH THE BUSH THEN HALF MILE ACROSS THE LAKE....GOOD FUN JUST GETTING THERE!      Lew had been talking up his cabin lake for a while now and was eager for me to come up, i was eager to go too. He said that there were large numbers of walleye in here, and whilst they generally didn’t get much bigger than 24 inches, it was often difficult to get eaters as they always threw any fish over 18 inches back. . I was pumped......and we did not waste any time and got fishing.   We all started off using beetlespins (which is becoming a favourite of mine all over again) with white jigs and white twister tails tipped with minnows.  Lew was saying that they only ever used white twister tails as bait and rarely used minnows as they did not produce as well on this lake, but he had been out the weekend before and minnows were out fishing the artificial...so we took 3 dozen with us, just in case.  I got into the first fish, a pike, then Lew got into a nice 18` inch walleye. We trolled around that spot for an hour but were just catching pike...nearly every cast!   1ST PIKE OF AROUND 40 THAT DAY       THEN LEW GOT INTO THE FIRST WALTER       Because we were only catching pike in that spot, we started to explore the rest of the lake, same result, PIKE....PIKE....and MORE PIKE. It was getting ridiculous, every cast for around 3 or 4 hours.    2ND SNOT ROCKET BONANZA I`VE HAD IN A WEEK!       We decided to head back to where we caught the first and only walleye of the day at around 7pm.  We were down to our last few minnows thanks to the pike, and Lew and his dad were both mystified at the results so far, they both said this had been the toughest day they had ever had since they owned the cabin....i think they’ve had it for 30 years or so.  I was convinced that the original spot would produce based on the premise that over the last week I’ve been fishing nearly every day, whether in front of our house or elsewhere, and every time the bite did not really start until 7 or 8pm.   Well the walters came out to play and we limited out in about an hour or so, throwing back at least 4 that were over 18 inches.  It was funny to Lew and myself, but his dad just couldn’t get a walleye yesterday, must have been frustrating for him as we were pulling them in consistently, whilst he was looking after all the pike in the vicinity...lol...i laugh but its happened to all of us.  We would have got a lot more and quicker if we hadn’t run out of minnows, as the fish just were not hitting and holding on without at least a chunk on the hook with the twister grub.  At one point we cut a half digested shiner a pike coughed up into 3 tiny chunks(one for each of us) and used that, as soon as we added that we caught more walleye...lol..weird.   Anyhooo, we got a nice stringer full of very chunky healthy walleye, had a great day out in the freezing weather of May and caught a lot of fish...cant ask for more.   sorry bout the pics....my camera is pooched...dropped it on the kitchen floor    BITE STARTED AROUND 7PM      LOTS OF NICE CHUNKY EATERS       THREW BACK A FEW OVER 18 INCHES       DID NOT TAKE LONG (once the bite started) TO GET OUR LIMIT AND GET OUT BEFORE DARK                  "

347024,limeyangler,2009-06-01 21:13:00,5204,"  Believe it or not my fishing time has been cut in half this year due to the arrival of our baby Jack...would not change backthough.....its all good!
