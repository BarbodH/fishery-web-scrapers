Bugs will be bad if it's warm out....but you might get lucky if you're far enough north.  I doubt it though Bring back lots of pics to post!!!!"

NO black flies and only a couple of mosquitoes, but if you get some hot weather they won't take long to show up in HOARDS!!!!!  Water temperature went from 39 to 58 in 9 days....awesome fishing as always.  Cheers Jason"

347406,Dara,2009-06-02 16:45:00,3052,  They don't weigh a lot do they?
347419,beerman,2009-06-02 18:14:00,118,I already have the bug net for my bunk packed up.. It does not weigh much at all..
