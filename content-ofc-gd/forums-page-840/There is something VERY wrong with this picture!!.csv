That is why this article appals me and enrages me..  How can a organization that is suppose to care for animals be so mis-managed and fraudulent as the TORONTO HUMANE SOCIETY is?  It is time someone is held accountable for this blatant abuse of animals..  Now before you think I am going all P3TA... that is the furtherest thing from the truth. I have a healthy respect for all creatures that share our earth, even the tasty ones... but cruelty is cruelty, plain and simple... and this I believe is tantamount to animal cruelty   Part 1 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1164168/  Part 2  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1160810/  Part 3 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1162134/  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1163147/  I will let you be the judge..  See the article, pictures and video... shocking!  G"

At first I thought it was exposing Greed and misappropriation of funds, to a Give to Humane Society.  Kind of a Red Herring article."

Licences, and manditory steralization should be required for pets or pay for a breeders licence Illegal mills should be shut down and prosecuted severly. You want to change this scenario... There are 2 ways to do it.  Increase funds which we don't have, or change the laws to make the responsibilty of ownership the law, and punishment severe."
