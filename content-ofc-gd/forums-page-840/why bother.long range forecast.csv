347293,bow slayer,2009-06-02 12:16:00,1074,"just checked the long range forecast on this site http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/saisons/index_e.html and now it is claiming the summer will be cooler and wetter than normal for most of central ,southern and near north ontario. Just 2 weeks ago it was saying it would be hotter with normal precipation. My question is why bother when it changes so much in such a short time frame. So what is it hotter summer or cooler wetter?They update this every 2 weeks or so ,next time will be on June 15th. Wonder how much it will change then?"

347307,Cookslav,2009-06-02 12:32:00,1457,"This is true... Now if only I could somehow get away from this thing called work, and convince my wife to watch my 3 children under the age of 5 every weekend I'd be golden! But I suppose on the positive side this crap weather will save me some dough on sunscreen as well"

347311,bushart,2009-06-02 12:39:00,2628,You know this glass could be half full.....  Think about saving on household A/C...and the trickle down environment---  Fewer waterskiers cause the cooler air temps...ehhh?  Fish surviving better cause water surface temps are reasonable..   We all own sweaters and raincoats---what's a couple rusty hooks---keeps mustad in biz.  Bushart
