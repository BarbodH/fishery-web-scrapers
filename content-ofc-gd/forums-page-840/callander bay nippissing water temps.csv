346803,love2fishhave2work,2009-06-01 11:38:00,212,does anyone know what the surface temps are in callander and the main lake are these days?
346847,laszlo,2009-06-01 13:49:00,487,not sure what the surface temp. is. i do know it's cold. the other night it went down to -2 in that area and apparently the walleye spawned 2 to 4 weeks later this year than others. i would guess at low to mid 50's.
346868,duckdog,2009-06-01 14:26:00,162,I was out about a week ago and it was if I remember correctly 51.7 at 10ft deep in front of lavase
346869,Bernie,2009-06-01 14:27:00,3190,Checked it on my way to work this morning. It has dropped from a high of 62 F to a paltry 51. BRRRRRrrrrr!
346879,Raf,2009-06-01 14:39:00,3495,sounds like the big winds have mixed things up
346881,Raf,2009-06-01 14:42:00,3495,is the lake still very high?
346884,edmichit,2009-06-01 14:48:00,145,Gov Water Level Temp Wave height this is a handy site to know of.
346944,Jonny,2009-06-01 17:45:00,1380,55 degrees surface temp in the Great North Bay yesterday. And the water levels are still way over normal.
