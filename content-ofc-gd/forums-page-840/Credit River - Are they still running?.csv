337220,rbaquial,2009-05-02 01:51:00,968,"Hey Fellow Addicts!  Just curious if the run is still going on @ the CREDIT RIVER in MISSISSAUGA. Anyone been there recently? Myself, a Buddy and my Brother are planning on going there this Sunday...  Any input would be greatly appreciated....  Thanks! Rob"
337227,e-z-out,2009-05-02 02:16:00,1052,Rob don't waste your time brother it's brown and flooded right now. i was there this morning with my little girl for a walk nothing but dark brown water
337230,rbaquial,2009-05-02 02:19:00,968,Yeah eh? You think the waters will clear up by Sunday Jose? Its supposed to be nice this weekend (no rain)...?
337233,e-z-out,2009-05-02 02:23:00,1052,From what i see it should be good in 3 to 4 days tops but i could be wrong. I would head up to simco and give the crappie a go or orillia for some perch  Good luck on what ever you deside Rob
337243,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-02 02:50:00,270,ok seriously ROb stay away from the credit river....the tourney was postponed due to it being in a flood stage......I am sure you guys can find something....if you don't believe me check out the General discussion a tourney was cancelled  due to the conditions I wish you only good fortunes my friend!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=31565
337248,steelhead hunter,2009-05-02 03:41:00,152,don't waste your time I was suppost to fish the tourney tomorrow and if they postpone that then it is WAY to bad to fish
346283,rbaquial,2009-05-30 03:34:00,968,"Hey Guys...  Just wanted to RE-ASK this question in regards to TOMORROW (May 30th, 2009).... Anyone know if the fish are still running? Hopefully I can get a response BEFORE tomorrow lunchtime.  Thanks in Advance, Rob"
346285,MJL,2009-05-30 03:43:00,2427,Running up?  Probably not Dropping back - Most definitely  With the rain we've had the last few days I wouldn't be surprised if the main river is flowing high and dirty right now.  It will probably be like that for a few more days depending on which parts of the river you go to
346306,siwash,2009-05-30 11:00:00,683,there can't be many rainbows left in any trib... maybe i'm wrong... i've found that my late may it's pretty much over..
346375,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-30 16:28:00,270,  eeeps ummmm yea Rain sucks..but tis a beautiful day..never know
346481,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-31 03:19:00,270,any luck today?
346499,CLofchik,2009-05-31 11:30:00,854," I saw two trout come out of different spots of a trib on Friday, hell on the Niagara & Grand there's bows almost year round.  Not alot but they're there.  One of the fish on Friday was still spewing milt!"
346645,rbaquial,2009-05-31 21:25:00,968,No luck whatsoever... Waters were all merky... even up till the mouth of Lake O - Couldn't even cast that far out...
346660,highdrifter,2009-05-31 22:14:00,2534,If I could whisper words of wisdom...  Let it be.  HD
346882,Paulus,2009-06-01 14:42:00,522," haha! funny  yes, there are always a few late spawners, but at least 90% of the run is done by the end of May.  p.-"
