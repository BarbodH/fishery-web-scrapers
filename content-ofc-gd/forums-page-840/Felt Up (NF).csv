345862,bushart,2009-05-28 21:00:00,2628,Ok perviacs it's not a new John Hughes movie---I've been asked to give updates on the art project.  Got the felt and rope/braid on skull cap---just need the back wall plaque and she's finis.  Bushart  
345890,Beats,2009-05-28 22:19:00,543,That's incredible!  Way to go.  What do you plan on doing with the finished piece?
345892,misfish,2009-05-28 22:26:00,29133,"That is a piece of ""ART WORK"" Bush. Thanks to you for shareing it with us."
345962,Big Cliff,2009-05-29 01:24:00,6899,"WOW, that is so beautiful!!!!! I love it!"
346022,brifishrgy,2009-05-29 07:45:00,559,Looks great man .. i wish I could do that .. stick figures is all I ever mastered
346030,BUSTER,2009-05-29 10:52:00,1336,Thats awsome.
346095,bushart,2009-05-29 14:45:00,2628,Thanks Guys  Like I said a while back it's tougher than it looks---you kinda have to have your picture flow with the curves in the antler.  And the antler itself being full of vein ridges makes it extra hard to be precise---definetly takes more beer  I need to acquire now a nice back wall plaque and attach them and it will be complete.  I have a few more moose sets in the shed but I think I'll wait awhile befor I do another.  Bushart
346273,Kenny G,2009-05-30 02:51:00,118,You have done a very good job. Kenny G.
346280,Sandbag,2009-05-30 03:15:00,533,Bush...that piece is beutiful.  I can only imagine what it is like to paint on those antlers.  Very nice job  Cheers  Craig
346299,Sinker,2009-05-30 10:45:00,8692,"I must say, that is AWESOME!!!  Just curious, how much would it cost to have something like that done? That would make an awesome gift for someone special!!!  S."
346408,bushart,2009-05-30 21:19:00,2628,  Lets say it would have to be someone very special --cause it's a lot of work---antlers are touchy biz with mnr when it comes to selling them---I've been told by the mnr-- the value of the art must exceed the value of the antler  Anyway at the end of the day your buying the artwork and the antler is free. If I understand correctly
