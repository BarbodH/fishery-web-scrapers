I was just wondering whos familiar with the area and what type of fishing should I gear up for ?  I want to fish for pike if possible.... any help would be great !"
347051,dave524,2009-06-01 22:40:00,4508,"My family had a cottage between Haliburton and Wilberforce, sorry to say that pike are the one fish that seems to be absent in the Highlands of Haliburton. Lake trout and smallmouth bass are most frequently encountered with some lakes having been stocked and producing muskies and pickerel ( walleyes). Speckled trout are found in some streams."
347070,bassassin,2009-06-01 23:32:00,152,"short drive to elephant lake and baptiste, both in that general viscinity."
347073,jediangler,2009-06-01 23:35:00,1923,"Elephant lake is polluted with pike, you can't miss there."
347076,Sinker,2009-06-01 23:37:00,8692,"Yep, elephant/baptiste is your best bet for pike in that area."
347096,dave524,2009-06-02 00:01:00,4508,"Agreed, you'll go a long ways driving west before you find pike water, none that I know of between Wilberforce and Minden. Highlands of Hasting and Madawaska Valley has got them"
347101,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-02 00:08:00,3761,"If your going for pike, than Elephant Lake would be your best bet. Not sure how to launch a boat or anything there but shore spots can be found along side the roads.  Good luck!, Take some pictures plz, haven't been up that way for the last 2 years."
347188,hookerdown,2009-06-02 02:15:00,110,"Used to go up that way a lot.  I have relatives who have cottages up that way.  Mind you I haven't been up there in about 10 years.   Amazing scenery there too.  What lake is your cottage at?  Like the others said Elephant and Baptiste are good lakes, Grace lake is pretty good from eyes and bass back in the day.  There are a lot of lakes with some good smallmouth bass too."
347198,mbac31,2009-06-02 02:36:00,904,"My cottage is on Grace Lake. Very few Walleyes in there now. I dont think there are many to be honest.  saw some while diving but they are like a needle in a haystack. Great Walleye in baptiste and Elephant. Baptiste, Elephant, benoir River and York River systems are full of pike."
347236,Sinker,2009-06-02 03:45:00,8692,"We've been on Grace lake for over 20 years, and I've never seen an eye in there. I never knew there ever was? Are you guys sure about that??? I'm gonna have to get me one if there is!!!!!  S."
347429,Lunker777,2009-06-02 18:39:00,866,"My gf's Aunt re-Married and the guy she married, his parents own the cottage.
