347325,Maritimer3,2009-06-02 13:12:00,5,"Lots of good fishing in Nova Scotia. Aside from the salmon you'll be hard pressed to find anything as big as a pike. great trout fishing though. The Cornwallis River in the Annapolis valley is good for browns, Baddeck, Middle and Margaree rivers in Cape Breton have rainbows, brookies and salmon. Grand Lake (not far from Halifax) has a good mix of everything. Chain Pickerel are everywhere now unfortunately, but you cam have an ok time catching them. Almost every lake around Halifax/Dartmouth has smallies and chains, and a few have landlocked salmon.  If you get bored and want some steady fishing, walk down to point pleasant park in the south end of the city and take the path out onto the pier. While I was writing my masters thesis I had more than one great evening of fishing for cod, pollock and herring.  Cheers"

341844,mepps,2009-05-15 16:14:00,1301,"Its been a couple years since I've had the pleasure if fishing in Ontario. I've been living in Halifax for almost two years and it kills me to read all the spring fishing reports of big fish caught in Ontario. Well, my sister, who lives in Ontario, recently had a baby, and I decided that this would be a perfect time to visit my old stomping ground in Toronto, and visit the famn damily.  We spent two weeks in Ontario traveling between Mississauga, London, Kincardine, Guelph, St Catherines, Niagara Falls and everywhere in between to visit friend and family. I had hoped to fish the Thames in London with my son and his 2 cousins, but the water levels were brutal, and  flood waters arn't exactly safe for wee children.  Luckily my son had a good time anyway.     especially at the zoo...      I went steelheading for the first time in the Penetangore Rive in Kincardine with Scott Duncan, and while we spotted a few nice steelies, the only fish landed was a small pike caught by my buddy Scott. Oh for one.          And after fishing Scott he tattooed my wife...     I went steelheading again, this time in the Credit River with a fellow OFNer (HighDrifter). Good times were had - we even saw Fidel's Spirit animal, a coyote - but no fish were caught.  Later I met up with Snag to make an exchange out of the trunk of my car in the form of fishing lures. Ending up running into a fella named Bruce who is the head of Muskies Canada Mississauga. We chatted for a bit and Snag was pretty late for work - he may or may not have been fired.  Finally, on the day before I had to leave (May 9), I made my way out to Toronto Islands with my buddy Jon and finally got into a fish. A decent little pike, which is considerably larger then anything I've caught (or seen) here in Halifax. I'll get some more pics added tonight, but here my first TO pike in ages!    So until next time Ontario, so long and thanks for all the fish!"

341853,mepps,2009-05-15 16:40:00,1301,"Well I do have another weeks vacation, and I do love Lakair - but the taxman tells me I gave to give him $2068.  So I guess that means no!"
