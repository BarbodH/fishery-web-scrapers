346118,fishinggeek,2009-05-29 16:00:00,325,Thinking of trying Honey Harbour area sometime.  What's the nearest boat launch?  Tried googling but wasn't sure which ones were close to good fishing spots.
346133,mikeh,2009-05-29 16:43:00,824,"I'm sure all the marina's in the area have launches, I launch in Victoria Harbour and drive by boat to Honey Harbour, about 5-6 miles by boat. Just check the winds and wind direction for the day to make sure it's not going to be too rough."
346223,Rizzo,2009-05-29 23:11:00,4754,"I've fished there once (many years ago). We just drove around til we found a place to launch, wasn't a problem as there were a few options as I recall. Sorry I couldn't be more specific."
346287,tizfun,2009-05-30 04:26:00,292,"We launch out of Village Marina.. Follow the Honey Harbour road as it winds around the Delawanna Inn..  It'll be on your right side just before the road ends...  As soon as you drive in the dirt driveway, you'll see boats parked on your right side (sort of in the marsh).. These are the locals..  Keep going (300 feet) till you get to the house or marina shop.. You'll see the ramp there...  Launch and then park your vehicle & trailer back towards the entrance... You'll see where the other ones are parked..  $15.00-$18.00 to launch and park.. (depends what mood they're in)   They're by far the cheapest in Honey Harbour...   I know, launched at another marina early and parked.. Got back and they asked for $50.00.. Told them they were nuts. Offered them $15.00 and got in my truck and left... Never went back there...  A soon as you get out of the marina channel... stop and start casting... alot of Pike and Bass in this bay..  Hope I helped you out... Good luck....   Tiz"
346289,Zubris21,2009-05-30 04:51:00,563,"There are a couple launches there.  I worked at camp kitchikewana for a fall and Honey Harbour was our port.  I forget the name of the Marina, but it is a big blue place up on top of a hill, I recall the launch being relatively steep, but it was still a good one.  I also believe there is a launch right in the middle of town almost directly across from the post office/grocery store.  really there are plenty of places around there to launch, you shouldn't have any problem at all."
346305,siwash,2009-05-30 10:57:00,683,"that is a travesty that they would charge $18 let alone $50. Most people using those launches are coming up from the GTA and other cities... w/o this business these places would struggle to survive... with the price of gas and the economy the wy it is, they'll loose  lot of money this summer..  thye need to get real and adjust their pricing structure just like most businesses have..  i don't mean to offend anyone here who might be involved in this business, but I've had some bad experiences with marina operators. I'm always polite to people but many of them don't have a clue of how to treat customers... i realize they aren't fond of ""toronto people"" but who's keeping their businesses afloat? locals? don't think so..."
346319,Jer,2009-05-30 12:27:00,1426,"While out investigating possible fishing trips last year, we took a drive around Crystal Lake to check out any potential ramps.  The public launch at the south end was quite rough and the water was really, really low. The only other place was the local marina at the north end of the lake, we drove around and asked how much to launch and park for the day...  ...$30...we couldn't believe it, they justified the price by insinuating that the whole area was infested with theives and if we left our truck and trailer parked by the public launch or anywhere else, we were virtually gauranteed to get broken into. Of course, if we paid their ""fee"", our truck would be ""safe"".  It sounded almost like a protection racket. We never did fish the lake but I took a drive by the public launch again just yesterday and it looks much better with the higher water levels. There was a fancy SUV and trailer parked, didn't see any sign of break-in."
346326,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-30 12:47:00,10439,What ever happend to the public launch by the town dock?? I fished Honey Harbour for years and don't remember paying to launch there. But I'm old and my mind is getting mushy so I could be mistaken. It was 20 or more years ago.
346602,Zubris21,2009-05-31 17:31:00,563,"Thats the launch I was referring to that is across from the post office.  The only problem with that one is that there is no parking.  However there is a fellow just a few hundred yards up the road who lets people park on his property (he may be the golf course owner and using the course lot but I can't remember)  anyways he charges a small fee, I think it was about $10 a day, but fairly reasonable."
346854,fishinggeek,2009-06-01 14:04:00,325,"Thanks for all the info everyone, especially your detail tixfun!  It sounds like the area is dicey.  Any other G-Bay launches that are close, safe, and reliable?"
