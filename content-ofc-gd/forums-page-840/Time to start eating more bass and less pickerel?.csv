347086,Jonny,2009-06-01 23:47:00,1380,"I appreciate the more even tone of your second post, Fishnwire.  Let me clear up a couple of things. My wife and I eat a lot of fish, and almost all of it is store-bought salmon, cod, tilapia, etc. I would guess that in a typical year my wife and I would catch and keep about a dozen pike, about a dozen pickerel, about 100 perch, maybe half a dozen lake herring, and about a dozen bass, and a few incidentals (white bass, catfish, ling, etc.). We’re as much interested in the summer in picnicking, swimming and beachcombing on nearby islands, either alone or with family, as we are in fishing.  The times when we “limit out” are rare, and not particularly sought after.  To me, a “feed” is enough for two or maybe three people. I’m lucky when I have several feeds in the freezer. In my freezer right now, and this is probably typical, I have three feeds of smelts, about three feeds of perch, one of pike. I’m hoping to put up a feed or two of pickerel for when my son comes to visit.  This despite the fact that we live right on the lake and I can launch either of my boats off my ramp in 10 minutes. And in the winter, our hut is a short 1 ½ mile run out from our home (we can see the hut from our kitchen window).  When we lived in Timmins, and used to fish a lot of different lakes (many of them a long drive), we caught more, kept more, froze more, and ate more.  I tell you the foregoing to give you some context for my remarks.  Most of what we catch and keep is eaten the same day or the next. Yet I have nothing against someone who has a freezer well-stocked with a rotation of game fish, within the catch and possession limits of the regulations. Fish lots and you eat more fish.  Predicting fish stocks is an inexact science, but from where I sit it seems to me that the predictions are on the conservative side and the regulations are correspondingly conservative. The independent sport angler, particularly the one who gets out infrequently, is already the one who ‘contributes’ disproportionately to the balance, compared to commercial fisheries and tourism operations. But I accept that.  Do I trust government? No, except in the sense that I trust that they will restrict the independent angler to benefit others. I don’t complain about that, but I also think that if they give me the right to take a limit (that they set), I can do so once in a while.  And I object when someone tries to lay a guilt trip on me if I don’t release everything I catch. I felt that was the tone of some earlier posts."

347117,Rich,2009-06-02 00:28:00,3927,I'll take a feed of smallies over a feed of walleye anytime. Bass season's too short though.
347157,Fishnwire,2009-06-02 01:28:00,983,"JPJ...  From what your telling me, you are far from being a ""fish hog"".  I would never try to tell you that you should adjust your harvesting practices.  (Or anyone else for that matter.) All I was trying to say (dead horse maybe?) was that your and my limited strain on the system, along with every other Tom, Dick and Harry...does have an adverse affect on the waters we fish.  When an adult fish is taken, it's not like another one magically replaces it.  It may leave room in the ecosystem for another to take it's place, but it doesn't happen overnight, or endlessly.  Less people taking their limit frequently = better fishing for everyone.  I think every clear thinking person sees that.  Once again, I hope you continue to enjoy consuming self-caught fish, harvested legally for the rest of your angling years...I know that I will.  However, I'll also always try to remember that when I take a fish for the table, neither you nor I will ever catch that fish or it's future offspring again.  I'm fairly certain that you make the same realization...............so tight lines, brother!   EDIT _ The ""foreign anglers"" post by whoever was just nasty."
347363,Jonny,2009-06-02 14:27:00,1380,"Yes, Fishnwire, striking a balance is the key thing. Always in the back of our minds should be the true definition of ""conservation""  ---  ""wise use"". Not non-use, and not excessive use.  The fishing regs give us the guidelines and within them or in addition to them we can use our judgement as to our impact on the resource.  If I already have a wall-hanger walleye (which I do, from Little Abitibi Lake, north of Cochrane), I don't need to keep a big breeder, though I'm allowed. A picture or two and back into the lake it goes. But if I happen one day to be able to put four under-slot walleye on my chain, I'll probably keep all of them if I don't have any in the freezer*. If I have a nice pike on the chain then a couple of those walleye will go back into the lake. (I like pike for eating probably better than walleye.)  For me this lake (Nipissing) is the only game in town. When I lived in Timmins and trailered the boat to many lakes the whole dynamic was different. Lakes were hammered hard when the fishing was good, then when it tailed off people would go to other lakes and the stocks would eventually recover to a decent level (they never got as good as when they were first accessed). I don't think Nipissing can stand that, so yes, I make some personal choices which reduce my impact to less than what the regulations would allow.  Like I was trying to emphasize, I'm not a ""fill the freezer"" fisherman... but I will almost always ""catch and keep"" something.  Tight lines to you too.  ----------------------------  * Topic for another thread... fresh fish vs frozen. In a blind taste test I don't think I could tell the difference. Maybe my taste buds suck."

346664,pike slayer,2009-05-31 22:26:00,1177,"there are a few lakes in the sault area that get hit hard constantly for atleast the past 20years and the fishing is always the same. If you fished tilley lakes, crooked lake,jarvis, bone lake, etc. I was at tilley yesterday and there must have been 4-5 boats out there which is normally a ton for a lake around here, everyone always does well and lots keep their limit in smallies and walleye. Its been like this for 20years. i catch small fish and large ones and in large quanities. At my favorite pike lake between me and 2 buddies we all take home our limit each time we go there and my buddies uncle believes no rules apply to him and i've seen him take home a garbage bag full of fillets, now thats wrong but the point im trying to prove is we still kill them in there. but anyways i've had enough with this topic im gonna keep doing what i do and you guys just keep doing what your doing and keep your mouth shut. if someone every comes to me and complains im taking home my limit i'll slap them with my stringer!!"
346733,duber,2009-06-01 02:23:00,220,Catch and release kills some fish as well.So don't fall to hard off that horse when that terminally injured bass or walleye comes floating by your dock and is wasted (against the law) because it is against someones moral standards to keep a fish.  Come to Belleville and take a look along the shoreline after a few weekends of catch and C&R bass tourneys and you will see more dead 3-5 pound bass being eaten by seagulls than most people will keep in a lifetime of eating fish.   If you choose to only C&R thats your choice but don't preach to those that don't.
346739,Kerry,2009-06-01 02:43:00,383," Well Sinker, I didn't go to the meetings but I did do the online survey for my input as I love fishing in the Kawarthas.Balsam Lake being my favorite.Really hope that a winter panfish season comes into play in the future for the Kawarthas. On that note to answer to the original post I have no problem eating whatever I catch IF I'm in an eating mood.I only want for a good fresh fish dinner once a week as well.I'll eat the same in bass as walleye although I prefer bass to be no more than a pound max.  Gary2rs Don't forget that fish spawn too.It's not like the lake/s have a finite number that is being whittled down to nothing.Some lake populations need enhancement others just need management.Most need the cormorants culled and everything would be fine.At least that's my view. Kerry"
346760,Garry2Rs,2009-06-01 03:12:00,1425,"Dear Moosebunk and friends; I asked you to please, not take my comments personally.  I don't dispute your right to take fish legally. The laws may be stupid, but no one can not fix stupid.  My first problem is with the concept that limits are set with the best interest of the resource in mind. Next, I dispute the idea that the fish are free and just there to be taken... Those fish are the future. If you can not see the truth in that, forget it!  There is no future!  About limits... In the Kawarthas we have had a number of low recruitment years for Walleye... I honestly feel that the Walleye fishery should have been closed, to allow it to regenerate. But what has happened?  The limits have not even been reduced!!! WHY? Because lower limits are bad for business!  Businesses in this area have a 14 to 16 week window in which to make a living. So my friends, we will screw the resource to keep the dollars flowing. Yes, this is short sighted, because the tourist who didn't catch fish isn't coming back, but as I said you can't fix stupid! Could we agree that this is total bull-poop and a sell-out of the resource?  But, that's the way the game is played. North of #17 is a totally different story.  I don't know what your situation is... I think only Dan, Joey and TJ actually live up there year round and I think they fish with dynamite. Down here in Cottage Country we are within two hours of The Big Smoke...Toronto. We have a tournament or two and perhaps two hundred white bucket shore fishermen every weekend. People are casually killing fish that it took us 10 or 12 years to grow. Every big fish you remove makes space for a bunch of small fish...If you keep doing this we might be a panfish fishery in a few years!!!  Look at Europe and England, people fish for trash fish and minnows... Why? Because there ancestors killed all the game fish. You can do the same for your children if you choose. I DON'T CARE!!!  I am old and in a few years I will be dead and gone. You will have to explain your part in the extinction of game fish to your Grandchildren...Good Luck!"
346768,pike slayer,2009-06-01 03:23:00,1177,Ontario is to big! should be cut in half! or a 1/4 off it. cut southern ontario off and let them be their own country cause its a whole different world down there with their own problems! i've been down to southern ontario and fished there and i know what they are talking about although where i am in ontario its a total different fishery and i find much better. turn everything south of barre catch and release haha!!
346771,Fishnwire,2009-06-01 03:36:00,983,"If the pressure of many anglers catching and keeping fish didn't have a detrimental effect on fish populations than why do so many of us prefer fishing in remote locations, as apposed to in the middle of town?  Why do fly-in lodges stay in business?...why not save the expence/hasle of transporting yourself and your gear into the middle of nowhere if fishing pressure didn't make any difference?  The reason people are eager to fish in waters that experience little or no fishing pressure is because the fishing is better there.  Period.  The more fish that angler A takes from a particular body of water, the less fish that are there for anglers B through Z.  We all know this and pretending otherwise is just silly."
346778,timmeh,2009-06-01 04:14:00,609,"For those who think it's fine to always take fish one thing to think about is that fishing is changing. The internet has changed most things in the world and fishing is no exception.  Years of searching for hotspots and learning techniques are replaced by 2 hours of clicking a mouse. People are getting a head start, the days of showing up to an unknown body of water and trying to figure it out are long gone. Now you show up and know every species in the lake, have multiple maps of the lake bottom, and have cameras that show you exactly what's down there, along with 20 reports by people who fished the lake last week. There is so much info out there and that only serves to increase the pressure.  I feel that limits need to reflect this new age of ""internet angler"". Since most of these people didn't spend those hours learning on the water they sometimes don't have the same respect for our resources as those who have spent years fishing."

346801,big guy,2009-06-01 11:29:00,414," Actually the limits have been reduced, from 6 fish with no size restrictions to 4 fish with only 1 allowed over 46 cm (18""). And most likely they will be reduced again, if I had my way, 4 fish with zero fish over 45 cm (17.7"").    You keep using examples such as the one above and the Arizona one to make your case, but really, it's apples and oranges. You can not compare two areas that are so vastly different in size and population density and that are so vastly different in the resources they provide to make a case for total catch and release fishing."
346804,big guy,2009-06-01 11:40:00,414,"  But all the information in the world and the high tech gadgetry will not put fish on your stringer. You still have to catch them.  I do agree with your respect assessment however. The now generation doesn't and hasn't had to work for anything in their life, if they want something, they go and  get it, or have it given to them."
346894,Jonny,2009-06-01 15:05:00,1380," Smallmouth bass is fine eating from Nipissing.   Shhhhh! You don't want to blab that all over.  With pike you get it all. Good fight, no slot limit, often bite when other fish are turning their noses up, great-tasting meat when you take boneless fillets.  Take boneless fillets off a 3 or 4 lb pike and you've got more meat than off of two or three under-slot pickerel.  I think people avoid them because of the reputation (""they"" say pike taste crappy unless they're caught in cold water - Bull), and because of the mess of cleaning them, and because of the bones (they don't know how to fillet them boneless).  Best way to clean pike (when you know how to take boneless fillets in the first place) is on newspapers. You can do this even on your kitchen counter (especially handy in the winter).  Take a cutting board (scrap piece of plywood or chipboard will do), cover with layers of the Toronto Star (Saturday edition will do LOTS of fish), and go to it. The remains go in a plastic grocery bag, crumple up the wet layers of newspaper and chuck them in the bag too, then you're ready with a clean surface for the next fish. No muss, no fuss. Wash your hands with lemon-scented dish soap and you're done.  Sprinkle the fillets with lemon juice and rub in. Dredge in salted and peppered flour, and fry in hot oil with a dab of margarine. You'll come back for seconds.  Of course you probably know all of this already, Cram.  I'm just blabbing to the uninitiated."
346916,Jonny,2009-06-01 16:35:00,1380,"I just finished reading the rest of the thread and I'm surprised by a few of the statements.  Fishing is not golf.  While I can respect the opinion that catch and release is the only personal choice for some, I cannot respect the advocacy of it, especially in terms of us “ruining” the future fishery, and by implication having to feel guilty about bringing a few fish home.  Europe is no good example, no good at all. The European fishery was wrecked long before any regulations were in place to maintain a sustainable harvest. The European experience does not translate to Ontario. Neither does some limited fishery down in a place like Arizona where people are fishing for stocked fish in artificial reservoirs.  We have regulations in place for sustainable harvest, and those regulations have been (and will be, wherever necessary) adjusted to reflect fish populations and pressure on them. That’s the MNR’s job; that and enforcement, of which they do too little to catch people who disrespect the law. (There’s part of the real problem, and one that can lead to depletion.)  If I respect catch limits and size limits and fishing seasons, I am doing exactly what I need to do to follow an expert assessment of what needs to be done so my great-grandkids can catch fish too. Feel guilty about taking home a limit? Not on your life. Not when I’ve fished on days when I’ve gotten skunked or only caught one or two. Not when I’ve released undersize fish that I could have taken home to make a limit. Not when I’ve bitten my lip and released a big breeding female. Not when I’ve taken less than my limit (but could have kept more) because the freezer already had several feeds of fish in it.  By the way, I’ve got all the goodies: depth finder, temp gauge, GPS – all the modern gadgetry – and I know where to fish. But if they ain’t biting they just ain’t. It’s like the old ‘Bits and Bites’ commercial – you never know what you’re gonna get.  I was out day before yesterday and caught two fish. Yesterday, I was skunked. If I go out tomorrow and catch my legal limit of legal fish, you can bet they’re going to come home with me.  True, there is nothing like the excitement of actually catching a fish, but the pleasure in preparing fish and serving them up to family and/or friends, for a treat the like of which they can’t get anywhere else, surely ranks high in the reasons to go fishing.  Part of the pride in being a fisherman is in providing yourself  and your family with food. If all it were was just whipping the water with a lure, or dragging a troll, I wouldn’t do it. Fishing is a little more than just a game, bass tournaments notwithstanding. If I didn’t want to eat some fish, I’d leave the fish alone; it’s too much trouble and I could  more easily just go boating --- and buy salmon and sole and tilapia in the grocery store at a fraction of what I pay for gear and gas and bait.  I used to find duck hunting terribly exciting - a lot more exciting than fishing - but I gave up duck hunting because I don't really like to eat duck, and neither does my family.  As long as I respect the fishing regulations I feel zero guilt about bringing home a feed of fish.  Sorry if this post sounds more passionate than respectful, but that's the way I see it."
346922,TJQ,2009-06-01 16:54:00,7806,"Yup... pike are great eating if cleaned right and bass.. well I love them before they get wormy.. ate one a couple of weeks ago.  I've also said this before, that there is a bit of a difference in the way northerners and southerners treat fishing, not that there's anything wrong with that.  AND this is a GENERALIZATION, but northerners tend to fish for fish, while alot of southerners fish for sport.  Once again thats a generalization.  Now since this boards inception Ive learned more about catch and release than I ever would have thought. I used to be a catch and keep all angler, and over the years Ive graduated to a catch and keep what I am going to immediately consume.  I've gone from poo pooing bass and pike, to eating them more than pickerel (mainly cause I'm a lousy pickerel fisherman.. lol)  I routinely go out and fish without the intention of keeping any.  BUT everyone fishes for a different reason.  My dads 75 and it drives him nuts when I tell him I caught fish and didn't bring any home.. he cant understand the justification for all the trouble if you not gonna bring any home.. hes from the north, from another generation.  I eat lots of pike and bass.. cause they are good to eat, pike is EASY to clean and, they are much more plentiful than pickerel.  Vist me at lakir.. and Ill feed you some pike thats better than most peoples pickerel!!"
346928,bigugli,2009-06-01 17:10:00,6138,"It's not North vs. South.  It's city slicker vs. country bumpkin.  The difference between gathering up your food yourself or running to the supermart.  I grew up in that subsistance culture and I spent 20 years living in Toronto. I was only too happy to leave the urban environment. I still C&R but I still take enough for the table on a regular basis.  By the way,  where is this shortage of fish in FMZ 17.  I find lots of fish every time I'm out that way."
346938,big guy,2009-06-01 17:30:00,414,"  That brings up something that I have wondered about before. The MNR bases a lot of their findings based on the various types of trap netting they do at different times of the year, but are the samplings they get in the nets enough to form the basis of the regulations they put forth? I assume somewhere there are years of studies to prove it all, but there are a lot of factors invloved, weather patterns, water temps, net positioning and so on. I noticed while reading through the document that my favourite pickerel lake didn't have an entry under the the Population Trends and Information section. To someone who doesn't know the lake, you would think that the fishing has really gone downhill, but yet I know the fish are there and good ones to boot."
346939,Jonny,2009-06-01 17:36:00,1380," I guess I'm more of your Dad's generation, TJ, though I'm not quite 60.  I learned from my Dad (and my Mom), and to them fishing was a sport and a recreation with a tangible result - fish on the table. So the money spent for recreation had a considerable side benefit. I have that same attitude.  Of course all within the law (the regulations) for the species and the lake, and I think by doing that you respect not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of the law.  Within that, as you say, C&R is a personal choice. One which I use when I feel it's appropriate, which is often enough."
346996,Fishnwire,2009-06-01 19:31:00,983,"  Most of what you said I don't have a problem with.  However...  Like I said before...The regs were not designed solely with the well-being of the fishery itself in mind.  They are (at best) a compromise between what is best for the fishery and what best facilatates commerce.  Like it or not, Capitalism is king in this country and certain people's economic self-interest will always trump what's best for the whole.  Saying ""I don't break the regs, therefore I'm not a strain on the system,""  is a little like saying ""It's not my fault those kittens I stuffed in a sack and threw in the river don't know how to swim.""  It's kind of funny how people have such blind faith in the government's ability to properly manage the fishery...do you have as much faith in that same government to properly spend your tax dollars?  I do not.  Secondly, as far as having to ""bite your lip"" to avoid slaughtering a ""big breeding female"" or not keeping fish when your freezer is already full...Do you want a freakin' hero biscuit?  Not keeping the big breeders, and not stuffing your freeezer full is a no-brainer.  Sorry if that sounds more passionate than respectful, but that's how I see it.  Lastly, if the prospect of spending a day pursueing the sport of fishing and not catching fish you can stuff your freezer with is ""too much trouble""...maybe you should consider a different pastime.  Angling is not for everyone, maybe you're one of those people."
346999,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-06-01 19:40:00,0,"I also prefer to catch and release in most cases, but also do my own tagging as well, cutting the cheeks out of 25inch plus walleyes and letting them go to swim another day    JUST KIDDING"
347010,Jonny,2009-06-01 20:31:00,1380," Oh really. Here on Nipissing the sport fishery has seen a reduced limit and a slot size directly because heavy winter fishing through outfitters, and a native commercial and sustenance fishery for walleye, have required it in order to maintain fish stocks. Everybody has a stake in it. Deplete the stock and everybody suffers, and everybody knows that. Commerce and sport are not separate issues. They all fish out of the same ""pool"".   That's a poor analogy, but I wonder what makes you so cocksure that your perception is correct? Your politics?   That's a whole other issue for a political forum which, I gather, this is not.   Figure of speech, sir. If a twinge of regret at letting a big fish go, especially when you haven't had much other success, isn't in your hard-wiring, then so be it.  And I didn't write my post for my (or your) edification. I was describing what I do and how I see things. I think that's one of the purposes of this forum, unless I mistake the intent.   I didn't talk about ""stuffing my freezer"", did I. Don't try to put words in my mouth to make your case. And if you don't like my philosophy of ""catch and (selective) keep"", I won't lose sleep over continuing to do what I do. Like someone else above, you seem to be easy with trying to lay on a guilt trip when someone doesn't see it your way.   Well thanks for the reply. Now that I'm finished responding, I'll file it."
347018,timmeh,2009-06-01 20:54:00,609," Well here's the issue with this. If you've got fish in your freezer they count towards your possession limit, which is usually the same as your daily limit. So legally you cannot keep your limit that day. If you've got a freezer with several feeds already in it and bring home more it really sounds like you're over your possession limit, which is breaking the law."
347021,danbouck,2009-06-01 21:02:00,4380,  I have several feeds of perch at home now (about 10 perch) so that means I can still bring home 40 more.
347028,Jonny,2009-06-01 21:21:00,1380," If I have 4 pickerel in the freezer and I bring home 6 pike, or 2 lake trout, or 50 perch, or any combination of those, how does that put me over the limit?  Yes, I know all about catch and possession. And no, I never have that many fish in my freezer.  They go pretty quickly, especially in the summer for family fish fry's."
347048,Fishnwire,2009-06-01 22:24:00,983,"JP Jonny...I can't use the quote function as proficiently as you, so I'll have to clear up what I was saying without it.  I know ""Commerce and sport are not separate issues."".  But some people are more corcerned with short term commercial growth than the long term enjoyment of the sport.  As far as my politics go...I'm not a commie or something, but you don't have to be to recognize that a lot of the time the government doesn't always make the best policy decisions.  Do you agree with the current government's stand on gun regulation?  Separate forum or not,  they do make mistakes, right?  I'm just asking why people are so eager to asume that expert minds have made brilliant decisions as far as sport fishery management goes.  ""The governement says me taking a certain amount of fish from a particular body of water every day won't hurt the fishery.  They MUST be right.""  Does that sound right?  ""stuffing your freezer,"" may have been going a little far on my part.  But you did mention your freezer having ""several feds in it.""  Why is it so hard to resist putting (possibly stuffing...sorry) more fillets in there if you're next few meals are taken care of?  Like I said before, go ahead and keep your legal limit of fish.  I have no problem with that.  But if you think that doing so on a regular basis doesn't have a detremental effect on other's ability to enjoy the sport, you're deluding yourself.  That whole "" Sorry if that sounds more passionate than respectful, but that's how I see it."" was quoted from your post.  I didn't mean to disrespect you when I said it, but was attempting to find commen ground.  I apolagize if that wasn't clear.  I know nobody who enjoys doing so will ""lose a night's sleep"" over keeping their legal limit of fish.  Nor should they.  Every licenced angler who feels the need to do so should be able to fish for, and keep, their legal limit of fish on any occassion.  I would vigerously defend their right to do so.  However, if they try to tell me that a lot of fisherman doing so doesn't have a negative impact on the fishery, and by extention, other's ability to enjoy the sport, I'd know they were wrong, and wonder why they couldn't see more clearly.  Honestly, I don't want to get adversarial.  I keep fish for food, and I know that a percentage of the fish that I ""live release"" end up perishing as a direct result of their encounter with me.  I guess my point is that I'm aware that I'm having an impact on the resource and I try to minimize that impact.  And I sure don't go around thinking that harvesting my limit of fish (let alone fishing itself) on a regular basis doesn't affect fish stocks."
347057,fishingisliving,2009-06-01 23:11:00,170,"I just need one or two, 3-4 pounders for a good meal. If I am not going to eat them all right away, they go back. I never keep any over 4 pounds. (even 4 is pushing, 2 or 3 pounders are better)  If for some reason I have any frozen fillets at home.. I keep none!  weekend fisherman who fish for a bite, tend to keep their limit if given the chance.. species specific fisherman do not keep their limit, they keep a few for lunch and the rest go back. Tournament fisherman let everything go... after the weigh in! Perch fisherman keep their limit every time! Trophy hunters, will ocasionaly keep a couple eaters, but mostly let em go so they can grow.. Musky fisherman treat their fish like gods of the freshwaters and never keep one, and should they accidently kill one, they go to confession at the muskies canada meetings. Saltwater sport anglers dont even have a clue what the limit is... ice fisherman, freeze their buts off. foreign anglers are seen filling their buckets to the top with all kins of fish regardless of the limits or seasons.  what was the question again? oh, yes Bass taste great!"
347060,Moosebunk,2009-06-01 23:17:00,3970,"Nice Fil...  One question though... the guys here talking nothing but C&R only, are they tourney or muskie guys?  Or are they fisherman at all?   Had to.  Just messing."
346452,Moosebunk,2009-05-31 00:13:00,3970,"I keep walleye cause I can't catch enough halibut, mahi mahi, grouper, red snapper, salmon, trout, crappie, perch, whitefish, pike, catfish and arctic char to keep me happy.  Actually, I do feel it's important that fishing always involves an element of catch and keep.  It's the reason angling began and the way its roots have taken hold.  It adds reward and validity to hooking and potentially killing fish through the ideals of sustinence (first) yet with sport involved.  Probably the truest and most honorable meaning to what ""fishing"" is, has and always should be.  There's value to fish being in the water obviously, but to be a fisherman and keep fishing what it is, there has to be harvest.  Afterall, hunting without harvest is just stressing and killing animals... would not take long for that plug to be pulled.  Make fishing about sport only... our historic pasttime wouldn't stand a hope in hell come time to argue it's needing to exist.  Fish in the waters, that's up to us all.  Fish on our plates, that's up to you or me."
346470,pike slayer,2009-05-31 02:07:00,1177,"i totally agree with moosebunk! the soul purpose of fishing is to harvest fish. now im not saying go out and take every fish that is boated, theres limits in place for a reason and its the amount that can be taken to not hurt the population. By the looks of things on this site and i hardly see anybody keeping anything, seems like a good 90% of you guys on here only catch and release or only keep the odd fish now and again. I don't see what eveyone is complaining about , fishing is still great, if your not catching fish then you start to complain, i suggest researching and honing up on your skills instead of crying that theres no fish. i like taking home a few fish everytime i go out which is atleast once a week and my fishing isnt getting worse, i'm actually catching more fish then ever before. If i went out fishing every week back in the bush with a few guys and just never brought anything back ppl would start to wonder thinking im getting a weee bit to close to my buddies!"
346475,duber,2009-05-31 02:39:00,220,"Have to agree with Moosebunk on this one.I practice C&R alot but I also will take enough to feed my family on occasion.Bass , walleye , crappie, pike , trout , perch , bullheads , bluegill , I am a equal opprtunity carnivor.  As for the original topic, I have already made the switch to smaller bass here on the bay when both are open.Seems to be way more 1 1/2 pound bass than walleyes on the bay these days."
346488,bigugli,2009-05-31 09:18:00,6138,"I'm with moosebunk. Fishing is as much about the harvest as the sport. Take away the harvest and the 'granolas' will be screaming  animal cruelty.  I've heard that stupid line a dozen times last year in Niagara while doing the C & R thing in St Catharines for bass. I come from a family that has always loved outdoor living. I am proud of the fact that we are fisherfolk rather than anglers. Gram always told us to 'never play with your food'   We were also taught to only keep what you need. For those crying about depleted fish stocks, I don't hear too many telling us to stop eating bluewater fish. We've lost the cod. How long before it's tuna and halibut that are gone, if they are not better managed?  As for keeping bass, why not? Keep younger, smaller ones, up to a pound or so. Goes great with bacon and eggs in the morning"
346492,siwash,2009-05-31 10:15:00,683,"Can someone explain to me why the MNR doesn't stock walleye on a widespread basis? We stock a lot of other fish...why not walleye? It can't be for genetic reasons b/c they could use the brood stocks of the native waterways where they come from.. i.e. Rice Lake gets stocked with Rice Lake walleye... that would help boost stocks and they could also improve spawning habitat (like the did in the Moon River Basin)... in 7-10 years things would much better... plus, cut back on the possession limits on pressured lakes..  my 2 cents"
346494,Fishnwire,2009-05-31 10:18:00,983,"People are obviously free to keep whatever they are legally entitled to.  However, I know that for me, killing fish is far from the ""soul purpose of fishing.""  I would argue that anyone who thinks that way is not really all that passionate about the actual sport of fishing.  I fish because I love fishing.  If I was never allowed to harvest another fish in my life I'd still fish every chance I got.  Also, feeling that you have to keep fish everytime you go out just to prove something (as at least one poster indicated) is really quite silly, as far as I'm concerned.  Let me get this straight.  You feel if you don't harvest fish people will assume you and your fishing partners are gay?  As far as ""the 'granolas' will be screaming animal cruelty""...they will regardless.  You seem to be saying we should harvest fish to keep them happy.  That doesn't make much sense...they never will be and since when have you advocated doing anything to keep that group ""happy""?  Who cares what they think anyway?  Like I said, there's not much that can be said to guys who like to frequently take their legal limit of fish.  They're legally entitled to do so and have no doubt already heard about the benefits of catch and release more than once.  For whatever reason, they're not buying into it and it's unlikely they ever will.  There's no use judging others or getting angry with those who practice the sport differently.  Life's too short.  I set the catch and release policy off of my dock and out of my boat.  If you don't agree with my policy, you're welcome to fish elsewhere...where I have no say in your C&R policy.  That's just how things work."
346495,singingdog,2009-05-31 10:28:00,1047," Good post, but I don't see the evidence for this statement. Bass tournament fishing - arguably the most publicised and most visible aspect of fishing - is all about C&R and it seems to be doing just fine. As well, some of the best salmon and trout stream fishing on the east coast is on strict C&R streams, and they support a thriving guiding and fishing industry with no apparent outcry from nonfisherman."
346502,danbouck,2009-05-31 11:48:00,4380,   Not that there's anything wrong with that
346529,big guy,2009-05-31 13:36:00,414,"  Please choose the link I put on the very first post on this topic. The MNR document goes into detail about walleye stocking, some pros and cons and also talks about an option for developing put and take walleye fisheries."
346530,Moosebunk,2009-05-31 13:40:00,3970," There was a supportive point made along with that statement, which did lend to the thought behind it.  Rereading, maybe the message was a little too firm.  Ill tell ya I have no evidence though, it's all hypothesized and personal.  Same as the ""arguable"" and ""apparent"" examples here.    Will say this to anyone, keep your limit if you like, it's YOUR LIMIT.  I don't presume Canadians to be stupid people on the whole; but we all know there are idiots out there who totally abuse, and at the end of the day C&R is important, yet not necassarily and always the rule to live and fish by.  My heart and head are with the sport and the release, but I can't deny mine and my family's love of the enjoyment there is with the keep."
346531,kickingfrog,2009-05-31 13:48:00,8333,"Walleye are stocked in many lakes in Ontario. One of the challenges is the expense of raising walleye up to a length that is viable to survive when put into a system.   No issues with eating the odd smallmouth or largie, except that were I live and fish, I can catch and keep walleye through the ice and then again in April or May. Whereas bass season in closed during the winter and doesn't open until late June."
346542,Garry2Rs,2009-05-31 14:24:00,1425,"As Lawyers say...""Without prejudice."" I respect that those of you on the Moosebunk train aren't breaking the law and are completely within your rights.  I once rode that train myself.  I am not criticizing Moosebunk or any of you personally, and I resepct everyone's rite to continue doing what they want, within the law, until they find a better way. However, in my opinion, you are like spoiled children, who have so much that you don't respect what you have!  I spend six months of the year in the Southwestern desert.  In Yuma AZ. where I stay, they have about as much fishing water as there is in Hamilton Harbour, it's about the same colour too...grin...The city has a full-time population of 77,500 but that doubles during the winter.  The fish down there are seen as a precious commodity that have to be nurtured and protected.  Fishermen take ownership of these fish and work to protect them.  If these terms are strange to you, what I mean is they consider these fish to be something that belongs to their community.  If these few hundred fish are lost, there will be no more fishing and the whole community suffers.  When I say work, I don't mean they attend a few meetings to talk loudly about what the government should be doing for them.  They volunteer their time and their boats to attend Bass tournaments, that they are not involved with, to transport the fish from the weigh-in back out to various parts of the lake. We here in Ontario are blessed with an abundance of fish and water.  Unfortunately this also creates a disassociation between us, as fishermen and the basic resource that is essential to fishing...Namely the fish!  Those who subscribe to the Moosebunk theory must see these fish as so many wild flowers, that belong to no one, to be picked, or trampled with little or no regard. Why would you Care?  The fish are simply There!  They can be taken freely, as long as you don't exceed arbitrary limits, on how many, and when, set by organizations more concerned with the continued flow of tourist dollars than the true health of the resource. If this seems harsh, or you feel offended, I'm sorry. I offer in condolence two quotes for you to consider...Shakespeare said ""To thine own self be true.""  And I believe it was Socrates that said 'If your not part of the solution your part of the problem."" Unlike hunting, where without the kill you only have wildlife harassment, with fishing you have the option to release the prey.  Now is the time for a gut check.  You have a choice.  The benefit is obvious! You can catch a fish many times...you can only kill it once. Here ends the sermon...wink."
346548,Spiel,2009-05-31 14:39:00,9065,"I recall once the the late great Jacques Costeau saying something like this, (I wish I could quote it exactly).  The act of fishing for pleasure and sport as opposed to providing sustenance is one of mans greatest perversions.  Now I don't suscribe entirely to this thought but I certainly don't believe C&R fishing is the answer either. Fortunately most of the fish that make my aquaintance are released due to my distaste for cleaning them.   However I would never support an entirely C&R fishery province (country) wide."
346551,Moosebunk,2009-05-31 14:53:00,3970,"  If this isn't criticizing Garry you are the child.  C&R is a practice, not the law.  This past week law would have permitted me 4 walleye, 5 pike and 5 trout... I chose 2 trout.  The law allows selective harvest as well as the ""picking of wild flowers.""  Your Holy High horse rambling that takes a pretty broad swing at some people here does  nothing but show you have an obvious disregard for other's views and you don't mind being an arse.  What your experiences in the south have to do with mine in the north only cancel each others points... they don't permit you to refer to people who keep fish as ""spoiled children.""  I take fishing, fish, the art of, the love for, the keep and everything about fishing quite seriously and with much more passion than maybe you've ever demonstrated to us here."
346554,aniceguy,2009-05-31 15:10:00,1094,I think this will sum this entire topic up  Selective harvest for consumption within a fishery that the overall harvest is sustainable in both numbers and size is perfectly fine.  Anyone who thinks this comment is wrong needs a head shake and sadly will never understand the concept of sustainable fisheries......and simply put while its in his/her right to harvest a limit in reality  has no care or consideration for the future......and will never understand......summed up I think pretty good
346565,laszlo,2009-05-31 15:35:00,487,"  well put once again.  the thing everyone seems to be over looking is that this is not so much about the present but more importantly about the FUTURE. many live thinking ""as long as the fishing is good while i'm around then i don't care."""
346576,danbouck,2009-05-31 16:11:00,4380,"Why would the limits be set at what they are now if a fishery couldn't handle it. I like to think that most of the people working for the MNR know what they are doing. There are guys that keep their limit, others that only keep a few and strictly C&R fisherman. The ones writing the regs must look at the percentages and fish populations to determine what limits to set. Am I wrong?"
346577,dada2727,2009-05-31 16:13:00,108," Yes I am in Zone 17, fish pigeon, balsam, and few smaller lakes."
346617,Fishnwire,2009-05-31 18:31:00,983,"  I'm glad someone out there has a little more faith in the M&R than I do.  We all know government makes mistakes in policy, why are you so sure they're not making a huge one here?  Part of the reason the regs are set as they are is to facilatate commerce...Tourism, guiding, the amount of money spend on the sport as a whole might decline if stricter limits were imposed.  The regulations are not set out to be the ideal to maintain fish stocks but a compromise between what is best for the resourse and what is best for the angling community.  You could conceivable follow the rules and regs your whole life, never once contravining the law, and still be a huge burden on the system, negatively impacting others ability to enjoy it.  That said, anyone who thinks there's something inherently wrong with keeping a couple of appropriately sized eaters over the course of the season might want to think about giving up the sport...or at the very least give up the OFC."
346628,Dara,2009-05-31 20:08:00,3052,"Fish is food. people are going to eat fish. Its good for you. Whats the difference if I spend a whole bunch of money to go and catch it myself, or if I go to the grocery store and buy what somebody else caught.  I used to be able to catch a whole mess of perch here, but last year some so called ........... blocked the channel with nets and ruined the perch fishery.  Don't try and tell me that my few perch or walleye is going to ruin fish stocks."
346632,pike slayer,2009-05-31 20:42:00,1177,"i agree with dan bouck, i said earlier in this topic that limits are there for a reason and what the lakes can handle. it seems all the southerners are the c&r guys and the more northern guys keep fish. theres lots of lo pressure here and on 70% of the lakes here you wont even see another boat even all weekend of fishing a lake. Trails are rough to get into and fishing is turning into a rich mans sport. The MNR also stocks lakes so we can catch and keep fish."
346636,Fishnwire,2009-05-31 21:01:00,983,"  If a smaller lake sees hundreds of anglers fishing dozens of times each year, and each of those fishermen attempted to catch and keep their limit every time they went out, then no...I really don't think the lake could ""handle it"".  You would no doubt see declining fish stocks in that scenario.  Would the lake be wiped out?  No, but you'd start catching less and less fish.  The lake my camp on is so remote that it is basically private.  No one other than myself and my guests have wet a line there in ten years.  A lot of the time, the fishing is nothing short of spectacular.  I could probably keep a lot more fish than I do before I would start to see an adverse affect of the fish populations, but I'm not going to take that chance.  If I kept half my limit half the time I fished I'd slaughter somewhere around a hundred fish just in a summer by myself.  Who can eat that much fish?  I'm from Sudbury but lived in Missasauga for 5 years.  I don't think the attitude toward C&R is that much different north or south of Barrie."
346655,ColdH20guy,2009-05-31 22:04:00,312,"this post is getting ridiculous..those that want to c&r, go ahead..those that want to bring a few home just because we love the taste(like me),thank you for leaving them for us....bass and walleye are both great tasting imo.."
346656,Sinker,2009-05-31 22:05:00,8692,"I'm curious to know how many of the posters who replied here actually got off thier arse and went to the FMZ 17 public meeting regarding the new reg changes that are being proposed???  You all had your chance. It was posted here and on every other fishing site I know of, advertised in the papers etc........  I went, and there was only about 25 people in attendance, and that was including the MNR reps who put on the show. I was a little discusted at the turn out to be quite honest.  If your not willing to do something about it, or at the very least, learn a little about what is going on, then don't complain about it now. Your just as much to blame as the guys keeping fish.  I'm riding shotgun on the moosebunk train. My family and I like to have a fresh meal of fish once a week. I like to have something different each week as well, be it trout/salmon/eyes/perch/crappies/pike......we like it all. Ask my 7 year old son what he wants for dinner and  he'll tell you a fish fry every day!! Do I think my selective harvest of fish to eat harms the fishery?? Absolutly not!!!   Sinker"
346661,big guy,2009-05-31 22:15:00,414," Unfortunately I missed the local meetings, otherwise I would have been there like a dirty shirt. Which one did you attend?  I wasn't on this site all winter so was unaware of the possible changes and meetings altogether. I only found out about it by browsing around the MNR site one day. But I've read the literature and responded to the survey to give my 2 cents."
346145,big guy,2009-05-29 17:23:00,414,"Just reading through the Walleye Management Strategy document the MNR put together for Zone 17. On page 12 it talks about how bass have a negative affect on walleye populations, particularly largemouth. The document also notes that on most lakes in the region, walleye fishing constitutes about 60-70% of the angling effort.  Although there are many factors why walleye populations are getting smaller both in size and numbers, the main factor is harvest. Contrast this with the polar opposite view by many who target and/or catch bass and one can see how increasing bass populations are having a negative impact on the walleye fishery.  Maybe it’s time we had a switch in mentality, start keeping more bass for the table and make walleye fishing more catch and release.  Thoughts?  Walleye Management Strategy"
346147,jediangler,2009-05-29 17:28:00,1923,"If walleye could fight and bass tasted great, I'd be with you. I'd rather keep the crappies and let both the bass and walleye go. Haven't kept a walleye in over 5 years and never kept a bass."
346148,wuchikubo,2009-05-29 17:33:00,1114,"If this is the case, I'd also be inclined to determine which size of bass would make the most negative effect on the walleye. I wouldn't want the bass to be over harvested either or make too much negative impact to the better breeding/stock population.  In all, I think it's just more moderation we need to consider. I would suggest targeting more panfish as their population seems to be able to manage the pressure."

346158,hotrod,2009-05-29 18:18:00,103,If I'm going to go catch and release fishing then I'd rather catch and release bass than pickeral for the simple factor the picks don't fight near as much.
346162,cram,2009-05-29 18:24:00,1733,"Bass can taste great if you clean them right away.  At least SMBs do.  Light flesh, bit of a nutty flavour.  Thing is - i get the impression many fish bass for sport and walleye for ""catch and eat"".  I wonder why more people don't eat pike -- to me they are the best tasting freshwater fish (other than trout)"
346164,timmeh,2009-05-29 18:33:00,609,"The problem is too many people talk about how easy it was to catch a limit (and of course keep their limit) years ago, but complain that for some reason it's harder to get a limit today. I'd be inclined to think if harvest is the main reason for decreasing size and numbers of walleye then the solution to that problem would be to decrease the harvest of walleye (as has been done attempted slot sizes, etc.) So if we really want to increase walleye selective harvest is necessary.  Killing more bass is NOT going to help the walleye population. It will simply hurt the bass populations, and then 5 years from now we'll be wondering where all the bass went."
346169,laszlo,2009-05-29 18:47:00,487,the unfortunate thing here is that many people are creatures of habit and still behave in a very neanderthal type manner and will process this information like this:  pickerel...taste good...me want...me keep bass...taste bad...me don't want
346182,hotrod,2009-05-29 19:55:00,103,Sorry but I don't see anything neanderthal about keeping and eating your catch if it is within the legal limits. Lots of people prefer pickeral over any other fish and there is no need to call them names for it. If the populations are that low then the ministry needs to adjust the limits accordingly.
346185,pike slayer,2009-05-29 20:01:00,1177,"smallies taste fine, they just have more of a ""plain"" taste to them compared to walleye. i personally hardly fish for them cause they are such a poor fighting fish. Pike on the other hand taste better then smallies and walleye and are larger and better fighting fish and are a more of a low pressured species. With the lake trout limits being lowered next year in my area i think im going to target walleye more during the winter. I find in my area theres less and less ppl fishing."
346194,big guy,2009-05-29 20:48:00,414,"Given the choice, I would eat a smallie over a walleye any day. I love their flavour, very unique. I will also eat perch before walleye.  I love walleye, but one thing I don't like about them is that they don't stay as firm in the frying pan compared to perch and bass."

346211,aniceguy,2009-05-29 22:19:00,1094,"there is nothing wrong with comsuming a fish thats safe via a guide to consumption and overall harvest for comsumption doesnt impact the fish population.   I think its a stretch to move comsumption to another species rather it should work on a lake by lake issue and determine  what is sustainable, what size of the population is at risk and what size of population needs additional protection.  Sadly with the FMZ process this wont occur and you ll have over harvest in some waters, pushing comsumption to additional species.  The largest predator a fish has over 16 inches is man, and until sustainable use perimiters are established on a fish population education of anglers overall by anglers themselves is the best method to assist with populations at risk, fishing boards have a purpose and this one in particular due to its divergent nature serves a great purpose of educating active posters and the lurkers looking for a place to fish Saturday am."

I would much rather eat a Perch, Crappie, Bluegill, or Catfish than a bass!!!  You'll be doing the Perch and Sunfish (Bluegill and Redear) population by taking a good feed or limit every so often, they have a tendency to overpopulate which will cause stunting.  ... and yes, Pike are also excellent table fare as well!!!"
346265,Kenny G,2009-05-30 02:37:00,118,I will eat the odd smallie and just love perch. I don't eat walleye because I never catch them. Pike are too much bother to clean. LMB I find don't taste to good usually. Kenny G.
346281,siwash,2009-05-30 03:22:00,683,"bass is good eating... i never understood why people 'C & R' bass, but keep walleye w/o hesitation.  bass also decimated the brooke trout fisheries of central Ontario throughout the 20th century when they were intentionally released in brooke trout lakes...   they're like gobies!"
346309,Fishnwire,2009-05-30 11:19:00,983,"  Did you mean to say that smallies are ""such a poor fighting fish"" or walleye?  I have never heard anyone refer to SMB as being anything other than excellent fighters...arguably one of the best pound for pound fighting fish in the lake.  Walleye, on the other hand, don't fight worth a darn until you get above 3 pounds or so.  That's the reason I release the bass I catch but occasionally keep a small walleye or two.  Perhaps some people feel the same way.  Decent size pike are fun to catch, but I find anything under about 22"" a pain in the butt to clean, and I don't like the idea of harvesting one over about 26""...so my comfort zone is pretty limited.  I'd say pike, bass, and walleye are all different tasting but equally paletable.  But I guess it comes down to each person's taste."
346327,Garry2Rs,2009-05-30 12:58:00,1425,"Isn't it time to recognize that these fish are worth more in the water than on the plate? There is no economic sanity in our fishing.  We will always spend much more on tackle and transportation than the cost of a few pounds of fillets. Therefore, like golf and billiards this is just a recreation... You don't have to gut the golf cart or the caddy, to show your prowess as a golfer, why do you insist on killing the future of fishing to prove you're a great fisher person? Every fish you remove from the system reduces everyone's chances of success next week. Look at the math...If there were 1500 guys from this board out fishing every weekend, and we only take a couple of ""Keepers"" on our two day trip, at the end of the season there will be 78,000 fewer fish in our waters.  Those are our fish!  the ones we could have caught next year, the ones our kids could have caught... Now think about this, if there are an average of only 10,000 guys fishing this weekend, that's 20, 000 less fish on Monday, and 520,000 less fish by the end of the season...and none of these guys took a limit! Next time you belly up the feast of wormy fresh fish you brought home, think about this... You are eating your children's chance to enjoy something beyond Carp fishing."

I don't go over my limit, release the bigger ones, and only fish them for a few weeks until muskie opens anyways!  I really don't see the populations of walleye suffering at all to tell you the truth.  I have had more luck the last 3 years walleye fishing than ever before, and I only fish them in the month of may in the kawartha's.  Just my $0.02"
