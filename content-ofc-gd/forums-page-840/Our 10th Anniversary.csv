Seasickness was not on the agenda. Trolled the river with a few stops at fav areas...nothing happening til we reached the dam. Silver Bass and Cats were hungry thats for sure. The current was a real match for the Minn Kota and drained the battery in about 1.5 hrs. It was a short day due to the thunderstorm I could see rolling in the background but a good one spent with my better half.   "
