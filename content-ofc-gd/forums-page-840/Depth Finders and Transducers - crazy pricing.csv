346980,Jonny,2009-06-01 18:48:00,1380,"I keep my smaller aluminum fishing boat on a ramp at the shore (Nipissing), and a big storm early in May snapped the transducer off by pounding a log or something against it. Transducer was an Eagle/Lowrance ""skimmer"" type.  I shopped around for transducers and man are they expensive.  At the Bass Pro Shop in Vaughn (off the 400) I found a transducer for 89.99. And the price for a complete Cuda 300 depth finder? ..... 89.99. Just nuts.  Of course I bought the complete unit but, from what I've seen, transducers alone are way over-priced. I figure a transducer should be about 30 bucks, tops."
347012,purekgw,2009-06-01 20:34:00,585,thats way over priced i have see eagle ones for $29
347033,Jonny,2009-06-01 21:29:00,1380," Really. Now that sounds reasonable. Everything I checked, even ebay, had transducers that were $70+.  Can you point me to a source? It might be a good source for other stuff too."
