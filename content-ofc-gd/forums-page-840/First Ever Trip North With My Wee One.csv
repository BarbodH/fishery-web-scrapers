346863,MJL,2009-06-01 14:20:00,2427,Loved the report Mike.  Your daughter's a real trooper for getting out in that weather.  That's a beautiful spot you've got there...Mmmm walleye
346878,Paulus,2009-06-01 14:38:00,522,"Way to go, dad! I'm glad you finally got out fishing with your little trooper. Thanks for sharing!  ... and yes that pic of Riley at the campfire on the overhang is gorgeous.    p.-"
346910,strakey,2009-06-01 16:23:00,78,"wow solo good report, glad you are converting the little lady early. Your cottage is specatular, what a setting. You have to love those quebec settings."

346958,ehg,2009-06-01 18:05:00,2666,Another great report Mike! These ones with the family members are my favorites.(Like the trip up blueberry mountain you did last summer). Thanks so much for posting this       No brighter ray of sunshine than the sincerity and love of your own child.
347030,sneak_e_pete,2009-06-01 21:23:00,540,I really enjoyed this post.  Thanks.  I've got a 20 month old son and 2 month old son and I can't wait to take them fishing.
347059,bigugli,2009-06-01 23:16:00,6138,"There is no substitute for that private time alone where the child has you all to herself.  Moments to forever cherish. I was notorious for pulling one or the other out of school for a father/son or father/daughter fishing excursion. They need it and, whether we like to admit it or not, we need it too.  Well done dad"
347171,Leecher,2009-06-02 01:46:00,7832,Excellent report and pics Mike Those are the best moments in life when you get to spend quality time with your young one away into paradise land Certainly memories for ever Thanks for sharing Jacques

347196,solopaddler,2009-06-02 02:29:00,8605, That sounds perfect! We'll have to talk soon...
347201,oxcowboy,2009-06-02 02:44:00,544,"solo,  you have had so many great reports, but this one might just be the best one you have ever put on here.  what a great time for the two of you. great times to cherish for ever.  congrats on a great trip.  jason"
347244,fishing,2009-06-02 04:00:00,167,"Great report as always. Sweet little girl. Something from Google, ""Beavers tail slap at the approach of humans, at the presence of unfamiliar noises, and at the presence of unfamiliar odors."" http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/...n/predators.htm ""The beaver also uses its tail to alert other beavers by smacking it on the water."" http://ed.fnal.gov/entry_exhibits/beaver/beaver.html ""......to smack the water as a danger signal.""  http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/natbltn/500-599/nb537.htm"
347247,solopaddler,2009-06-02 04:07:00,8605," What was different here, each time I'd let it swim away at least 100yds. And on half a dozen occasions I induced it to swim right back to the point 20' in front of us by making the noises... Then Riley would pop up and it slapped its tail.  Thanks everyone for the kind remarks."
347294,Trevor0179,2009-06-02 12:16:00,65,great report cant wait for my son to be old enough to take along on a fishing trip
347320,ccmtcanada,2009-06-02 12:55:00,7971,"Now that's a report!!!  Fantastic memories there Mike...ones both you and Riley will hold onto forever.  When a young child just says thank you like that, it melts your heart...I've been there...and know the feeling!"
347322,wuchikubo,2009-06-02 13:06:00,1114,Fantastic outing with your daughter Mike!  She definitely has your fishing genes and angling desire! Your little piece of heaven definitely adds to the experience I'm sure.  My daughter is the same age but doesn't have the angling desire as yours or Cliff's daughter. Sounds like maybe we should set up an OFC father and daughter weekend or something.
346544,solopaddler,2009-05-31 14:32:00,8605,"While my 5 year old Riley has been north many times already we've never before gone alone, sans mommy. As a father of 2 young ones I can't wait for the day when I can start bringing them with me on my more major northern excursions, but a short trip to the camp was a perfect groundbreaker.  She knows that when we're nearing the ""Big Fish"" in Larder Lake we're getting close, and from North Bay onwards she asked me every 15 minutes when we'd see it.  Finally arriving in Larder she begged me to stop for a photo:      Not long afterwards we arrived at my still flooded landing, quickly loaded the boat and were on our way to my small slice of paradise.        After unpacking and settling in she says to me ""daddy I want to go fishing NOW!!""  Music to my ears.  In short order we were off to a known spring hotspot, a shallow lake connected by a narrows to the main body of water. The water was a couple of degrees warmer in there and hopefully the fish would be active...  Enroute Riley insisted on practising her waterskiing technique in the bow of the boat, (yes I was very careful.  ).    Trying to keep things as simple as possible I rigged her up with an 1/8oz jig head, twister tail and worm.  Crawling along dead slow with the bowmount I had her hop and twitch the jig along bottom as we probed a couple of weed edges in about 12' of water...  It wasn't long before her rod bowed and she literally screamed ""I GOT ONE!"" right in my ear LOL!  Managed to land it with zero help from daddy, and when it was in the boat she says ""That looks like a nice fat one, I think we should keep it for dinner"".  She's still a bit squeemish when it comes to holding walleye so I did the honours and she snapped a pic of me:      Not long afterwards she lay down in the bow and passed out:    I finally picked up a rod and managed 1/2 a dozen smaller males in short order before heading back to the camp.  Just about a perfect first day....  Day 2 saw us heading north up the lake to one of my favourite spots, another small lake connected by a tiny creek to the main lake. It's not usually accessable with the big boat as there's a beaver dam halfway up the creek. When the water lowers in the summer it's cut off completely, but with this springs high levels we had nothing to worry about.  It was a cold, raw grey day with rain in the forecast, but Riley was pumped when we set out:      I was amazed at just how high the creek actually was:      Even last year when the water levels were above normal I had to negotiate a 12"" drop to get into the lake.  This year we drove right over it...just unreal.    Approaching the lake we were both a bit excited..    Upon arriving almost immediately it started to pour rain. I asked Riley if she wanted to take shelter and she says ""no daddy I want to catch some fish!""  Rigged the same way as the day before she caught another decent eye within the first 15 minutes of fishing (Once again dad had to hold the fish):    She's definitely a trooper pulling out the umbrella and still refusing to head for shelter:    The rain began to come down in sheets and amazingly it was me who finally wimped out. There was a huge ice hut pulled up on shore that I'd used last spring when it rained. I made a beeline for it with promises of a warm fire and some hot chocolate. She was all for that.  Got her settled in and in short order the small wood stove was just a hummin' and the water boiling. It's acually pretty comfy in there:    After an extended period of drying out and eating tons of junk food, the skies finally broke.  I asked her if she wanted to go on a bit of a boat ride and check out some rapids. ""Rapids daddy?"" ""Yes rapids honey, they're very cool"" ""Awesome, can I swim in them?""  (There's no doubt she's my daughter)  We ascended another larger river travelling for a few km's upstream. It's an incredibly beautiful part of the lake..    Finally we approached the rapids:      You would think that this would be a walleye hotspot but surprisingly that's not the case, 90% of the fish in the lake are shoal spawners. Of course there's always some kicking around, mostly dink males, but normally I don't bother with this spot.  Initially upset 'cause I wouldn't let her swim she had a blast as we surfed around in the rapids with the boat.. (I think that was actually the highlight of the trip for her).  We were out a long time, from 8am 'till about 5pm, and we were both ravenously hungry when we arrived back at camp and began to cook up dinner.  A wee bit of surf and turf:    After dinner the skies actually cleared and the winds died down. I had promised her a campfire and this was the perfect opportunity.  I lit a fire down on my point and she got the marshmallows ready.  Is this not an incredible picture? What a spot...    We roasted marshmallows together and watched this crazily agitated beaver swim back and forth in front of the point smacking it's tail. I was able to call it in right to the point time after time by making cooing noises (beavers make a noise like that). Don't know if it thought it had lost one of it's young or was being territorial, but each time it saw us it smacked it's tail in anger. Riley was impressed.      Not long afterwards we retired to the sunroom.  I watched hockey:    And my wee one crashed:    The next day we packed 'er up and headed home.  That was maybe my best trip ever up to the camp, and even better on the way home Riley says:  ""Thank you for bringing me daddy, when can we do it again?""    Cheers,  Mike"

346703,rob v,2009-06-01 00:29:00,535,"You're a rich man - all the money in the world can't buy you that kind of experience.  Enjoy it while you can - because tomorrow they'll be all grown up.  While we didn't go anywhere quite as remote as your trip, my son and I made 2 or 3 trips in the spring to the Bay of Quinte when he was 10 or 11 years old for 2 or 3 days each trip and tented it at a local camp ground there.  I know I'll cherish those memories for a long time - and every now and then he brings them up also (he's 23 now).  I'm hoping that when the time is right he and I can do something similar again."
346707,Tarzan's Jane,2009-06-01 00:43:00,1183,"What a great first trip with your little one.  Love the pics, the story and her cute poses....that pic of Riley by the campfire and the scenery in the background is worthy of a frame."
