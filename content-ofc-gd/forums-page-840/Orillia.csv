So, the wife and I leave sunny Beamsville at 5:30 and we're in Orillia before 8. Good travel time. From that point things went downhill. Lit up the Coleman to get the coffee brewing and the wind starts to howl. Once I finally have the thing brewing go to get brekkie ready. Open the cooler and there is the margerine, milk, sugar and syrup, but no griddle cake mix. I forgot it in the fridge So next we try fishing the town dock. Talk about miserable, but the bride stuck it out long enough to say she was fishing.   After that Judy scurried back to the van to stay warm and we made a muffin run to substitute for breakfast Next we drive to the ultra secret perch hole. Tried the worms , all I got were sunnies, but there were lots of minnows so I scooped a couple  dozen. All of a sudden the sky goes black, the minnows disappear before I can get another scoop. All of a sudden its Freakin snowing! A few flakes at first then followed by corn snow and hail. Haven't seen that happen so late in decades. Despite the wind and snow the perch were feeding. Lots of dinks  with a few good sized ones mixed in for variety.  OF course it wouldn't be a typical ""Ugli"" day if I didn't fall down and get wet. Judy thinks I stepped in a soft spot. We won't tell, will we? Despite the adversities, it was still a fun day.  After all this is Canader, eh?"
