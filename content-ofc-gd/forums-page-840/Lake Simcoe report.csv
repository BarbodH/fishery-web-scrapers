346459,rhare,2009-05-31 00:56:00,387,"Finally got a chance to get out and fish on Simcoe, been busy chasing salmon and waiting for the new prop to come in ( just wear, didn't hit anything) We got out around 730-800 and ran over to the clan. Stayed to the outside the best we could. Dan got into a couple whities and a decent laker right away, well I kept dropping fish We both did well using tubes and spoons, boated 10 or so and lost..... way too many  :   even mix of lakes and whities.  The lakers fough like champs today, taking big line peeling runs. One actually almost pulled the rod right out of my hand! Guys working riggers out there today did well too, I saw many hook ups and even a couple doubles.  some great fishing to be had right now  tightlines  Ryan Hare    Dan with a pair of whities     This laker was heavy, must have been packed with bait!

346507,Cudz,2009-05-31 12:28:00,2652,"wow.  nice. if you do't mind me asking, how deep were they?"

346780,rhare,2009-06-01 04:38:00,387,"Thanks guys!!        not at all, we fished the 80ft mark most of the day and it was steady."
346791,Cudz,2009-06-01 10:30:00,2652,I was out but I was trolling from 5:30 until 9am and was marking fish all morning but did not even get one release.  I guess I should have found them and jigged.  Oh well.  I too found a bunch of fish around 79 ft.  I get out only once in a while (kids and a non-fishing wife) so I reall like to make the most of my time.  I was frustrated Saturday morning for sure.
346829,johnnyb,2009-06-01 13:09:00,3413,Awesome report!  I've never hit the whities on open water...I guess it's the same vertical presentation as on the ice?
346844,Joey,2009-06-01 13:42:00,9122,"Wow, way to go, looks like you did well.  Simcoe sure is producing this year  Joey"
346858,BillM,2009-06-01 14:09:00,17367,I gotta get back out to Simcoe one day this week me thinks.
