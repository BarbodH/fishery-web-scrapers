346949,anders,2009-06-01 17:52:00,1168,"This past Friday, my dad was home from out west and wanted to get into some eyes, and seeing that this year since opening weekend, the fishing, (not the weather )has been on fire, and friday was no different, expect that the weather was perfect.  My buddy and I new where we were going to go, we jsut had to find them.  It didnt take very long.  We tried trolling at first, but when nothing was biting we moved and tried drifting...not too long fish started hiting, fast and furious.  I will let the picture do the talking, but we had  a great night, we took home fish for dinners, and even met up with another friend on the lake who was camping and had a few cold ones around his camp fire before heading home for the night.    My biggest of the year so far..27 inches...sorry guys...i forgot the sign, and didnt want to keep him, next time...I promise.  Got him with the 5ft ultra light...what a battle   Dad and me...memories!     I did also end up getting a 27 inch pike...the only one of the night...again team...sorry....i am not holding my part of the bargain here...like i said...no more forgetting the sign.  Tight lines Anders"

346963,johnnyb,2009-06-01 18:16:00,3413,Best way to catch fish is to forget your sign    Just have someone tuck it into your gear when you're not looking!
