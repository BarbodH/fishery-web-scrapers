346509,Cudz,2009-05-31 12:32:00,2652,I can't see everyone's responses to threads.  I only see their name and I have to click on it to see the responses. Is this the new format of the web site or do I have to change something on my computer in order to see the responses the old way where you scroll through everyones resposes. If this is the new format I really really do not like it at all.

346512,Cudz,2009-05-31 12:37:00,2652,Thank you very much Roy.  That is way better.  I thought there must be something up that I couldn't figure out myself.
346515,Rich Clemens,2009-05-31 12:48:00,3131,Roy is just too fast.  I recall Irishfield having this same problem a little while back and had just found it when Roy replied.  Glad you're good to go.
