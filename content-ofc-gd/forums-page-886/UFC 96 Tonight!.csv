314716,steverowbotham,2009-03-08 02:43:00,1800,"Shane Nelson vs. Aaron Riley - Underdog bet, Nelson is so quick Brandon Vera vs. Mike Patt - This is an easy pick Jason Brilz vs. Tim Boetsch - I think Boetsch will gas early Kendall Grove vs. Jason Day - Day is good, but I dont think he'll solve the reach of Grove Tamdan McCrory vs. Ryan Madigan - I cant pick against a nerd Gray Maynard vs. Jim Miller - Maynard's strength and wrestling will win a decision Matt Hamill vs. Mark Munoz - Munoz is a monster, this is a tough fight to call, I hope Hamill comes out victorious Matt Brown vs. Pete Sell - Slugfest.  Brown takes it I think, but Sell could easily submit Brown also. Shane Carwin vs. Gabe Gonzaga - Gonzaga by submission, IF he gets it to the ground Rampage Jackson vs. Keith Jardine - Rampage with a dominant win  Who does everyone else have?"
314718,Terry,2009-03-08 02:49:00,14456,I don't know most of these guys but I will be watching  Rampage Jackson should win
314723,diggyj,2009-03-08 02:58:00,548,I'm taking Jardine in the main event. I think he will come up victorious.
314727,misfish,2009-03-08 03:15:00,29133, NOPE Jar is to wild and crazy and has that right leg.   NOPE  Shane is going to smash his face to a pulp. Should be a good fight though.
314736,steverowbotham,2009-03-08 03:47:00,1800," I'd love to see Shane win, I'd rather Shane win, but Gabe's jiu jitsu is ridiculous and Shane is a lot slower than Gonzaga.  Shane's wrestling is very good, so IF Gonzaga can get it to the mat, Gabe wins by sub."
314740,misfish,2009-03-08 04:01:00,29133,"Aint going to happen Steve,Shane is on a mission."
314743,steverowbotham,2009-03-08 04:30:00,1800,good call misfish sir
314749,Cudz,2009-03-08 06:04:00,2652,Good call on everything Steve except for Gonzaga.  I you watch the replay you will see that Gabe actually catches shane just before he gets knocked out. Some really big knock outs tonight.  I hope Munoz is ok.  Vicious kick just behind his ear.  wow
314761,BUSTER,2009-03-08 11:40:00,1336,Rampage and Rashad evans will be a good one
