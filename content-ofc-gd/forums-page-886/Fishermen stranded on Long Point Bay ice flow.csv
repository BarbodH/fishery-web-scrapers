Norfolk County : Ice Fishermen Safely Back on Shore Posted by Jen Waumsley  Two ice fishermen from Tillsonburg are safely back on shore after cracks in the ice caused it to drift away from shore. Norfolk OPP say the stranded men were airlifted from the flowing ice near Inner Bay in Long Point around 5:30 last night with help from the Coast Guard. Both men were unharmed. Warm temperatures and high winds had caused the early morning stable ice to become unstable and break apart.

314535,Sinker,2009-03-07 18:45:00,8692,"  Have you ever even been icefishing?? Do you know anything about ice conditions?  I notice your always piping up when ever there is an accident on the ice, but you never post a report?  Maybe you should get out there once in a while, you might learn something? The ice was plenty safe when they went out. Stuff happens.   Sinker"
