314851,tknohpy,2009-03-08 17:39:00,162,Hey Guys  I have an older boat and want to add a livewell.  I have never done anything like this and am just starting the research.  Any guidance from those in the know would be much appreciated.  Thanks!!
314854,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-08 17:46:00,0,"just buy a livewell kit on the internet basspro and cabelas  or find something sturdy to hold the water, cooler works good or go to a welding shop and get a livewell made up a little more money and fit it somwhere in your boat  here is a complete kit   http://www.cabelas.com/hprod-1/0001512.shtml"
314857,Cast-Away,2009-03-08 17:48:00,790,I've done it but what size and type of boat do you have? Do you know where you want to place it?

314870,tknohpy,2009-03-08 18:11:00,162,I have a 15 ft bowrider.  I am converting the seats in the front to a deck and placing the livewell in between where the seats used to be in the middle of the boat.  Here is an image
