There were lots of guys there stocking up on a lot of fishing lures...  Not many Wiggle-O's were left when I got there... STORM's Swimbaits are $1.50?! CRAZY!! I bought like 15 of them!!  Literally, there were 5 tinny's setup for the sales that are going on. Anyway, you guys/gals gotta go ASAP!! A lot of the pattern's you'll find that you're looking for - probably won't be there anymore!! There were a lot of people there when I was there today.  Here's the 'Circular' (aka: Flyer) link to the  2009 SPRING FISHING CLASSIC SALE @ BPS"
314260,GeorgeJ,2009-03-07 02:25:00,207,"I wish I had a Bass Pro near me almost makes me want to move to Toronto so I can be near one!  Luckily kids live there and they have my list, hopefully they get there early tomorrow..."

314262,rbaquial,2009-03-07 02:28:00,968,w00t!! I'm gonna go on the 21st to see Dave Mercer too!!

314282,BillM,2009-03-07 03:06:00,17367,"Canadian Tire has 1000yd spools of Trilene XL for $6.99.  Beats any deal at BPS, lol"
314287,rbaquial,2009-03-07 03:24:00,968," Mono? or Fluorocarbon? How long is this sale going to last until, do you know?"
314289,EC1,2009-03-07 03:32:00,930,Which Canadian Tire? Or is it a sale for all stores?
314293,Dan668,2009-03-07 03:50:00,1120,Bought storm swim baits and wiggle o's before. No luck haha. Only got a reel and a bunch of line.
314316,Stern Rules,2009-03-07 04:43:00,342,I'm hitting there tomorrow. I stocked up on those wiggle o's last year and got chain pickeral on 'em while in New Brunswick. I don't think the sale's as good as last year (i.e. no Berkley frenzys) but good sale anyway.
314325,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-07 05:02:00,947,yea it was a pretty good sale i can say i'm pretty stocked up for a coupe of years lol       hehe opps
314328,rbaquial,2009-03-07 05:02:00,968,"LMAO!! HOLY CRAP!! And I thought I SPENT A LOT!!  Hahaha... Good stuff there though, eh?!"
314332,timmeh,2009-03-07 05:14:00,609,"That BPS spring fishing sale is so over-rated - just like the store. The first time you're there is seems awesome just because of the selection, but i'd much rather spend my $$ at a local store. The prices are the same, but the service is usually way better than BPS.  And while sometimes you'll find something good on sale, most of BPS sales are on stuff they just want to get rid off."
314333,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-07 05:24:00,947,"Meh i usually just go once in march and the sale usually is on the same time so it works out.  As again i only stock up once every 2 years or so and i just stock up.  Just looks like a lot cause it really is hard to keep track of all the stuff you do buy during the course of the year, well at least for me lol."
314334,rbaquial,2009-03-07 05:32:00,968,"LOL - I went a lil overboard and bought a whole lot of fishing lures and equipment... spent almost $2,000 in stuff! :| I shouldn't need to restock till 2012.....thats if we survive it!"
314337,Mattones,2009-03-07 05:54:00,587, When ever i go its about that price or a bit more. Its hard not to spend alot there. Some of us are like kids in a candy store.
314395,Bernie66,2009-03-07 13:56:00,123,"Crappy Tire with 1000 yds Trilene XL on sale??? SURE!!! They probably have 2 spools per store, one 4lb and the other 20lb.  They are always out of stock on the things you want.  BIG SCAM IMO!!! P.S.  I am still waiting for a call back on my raincheck for an ice-sled. I wonder when hell is going to freeze over."
314444,CLofchik,2009-03-07 15:12:00,854,"You have to poke around, but there's usually some good deals to be had.  I like the Browning fillet knives, and 2 for 1 on Tuf-Line is awesome."
314484,brifishrgy,2009-03-07 17:12:00,559,Got there this am just before opening .. people lined up outside waiting to open .. got the new battery I went for and a few other things .. I got the last size 13 shoe  
314507,Jigger,2009-03-07 17:54:00,1237,I'll go only because I've got some gift cards to use up. Long way to go for some jigheads if I can just scoot over to Gagnons.
314529,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-07 18:32:00,3761, How much were those big soft plastic padddle tail storm baits at BPS?
314570,brifishrgy,2009-03-07 21:31:00,559,  $1.50
314622,eyeforelle,2009-03-07 23:23:00,38,"  Well, obviously Bass Pro is doing something right since the store was rammed with people today and the line-ups were huge. Maybe youâ€™ll win your Bass Pro rant next time boys. BTW, did you buy your Ang. Spec. at Canadian Tire and spool it up with 1000 yards of 30lbs. Trilene XL?"
314695,Mattones,2009-03-08 01:33:00,587,Went today got there at like 11. Figured it would be busy and it was. Lots of food sample stands. The fellow at the Jack Links stand filled my empty Subway cup full of jerky. haha
