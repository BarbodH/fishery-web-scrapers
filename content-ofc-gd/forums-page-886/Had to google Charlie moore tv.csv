I was watching the show in disbelief of just how brutal it was, meanwhle I had the laptop on my knees and I figured I would google to find out more about Moore now I wish I knew less about Moore (if that makes sence)  You have to check this out!!!  http://www.cantstopthebleeding.com/?cat=103"

314428,CLofchik,2009-03-07 14:50:00,854,He catches the biggest 2lb. bass you'll ever see!
314435,GeorgeJ,2009-03-07 14:59:00,207,His show does allow you to turn WFN off for a half hour and go do something else till it's over.
314442,OhioFisherman,2009-03-07 15:10:00,6623,Ya but did you see Paul Elias on Falcon Lake? LOL before I cull a 7 pounder I have to catch one.
314891,Rich,2009-03-08 19:44:00,3927,Yeah.. I really don't get that show. Watched it last month for the first time. Even my boss who has no clue about fishing said it was stupid and complained at the lack of fishing information or big fish.
