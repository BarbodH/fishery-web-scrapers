313873,buckster,2009-03-06 03:55:00,530,cool.... i'll give it a shot!
313880,BillM,2009-03-06 04:20:00,17367,I thought Lorne got out of the tackle business?
313948,Spiel,2009-03-06 13:15:00,9065,Lorne closed up LG Custom Tackle a looooong time ago.
313974,kemper,2009-03-06 14:44:00,2232,Kaman power technologies 905-624-9898  I do believe these guys may have what you need
314066,jdmls,2009-03-06 17:54:00,575,"This guy got me bearings for my stanton, just bring in the bearings and he will find you a replacement. Had mine in stock.  + he's right around the corner in Wapbridge  http://www.ontariobearings.com/"
314080,buckster,2009-03-06 18:43:00,530,Thanks dudes...... i eneded up getting them at canadian bearings around dixie and derry rd.   They only had open bearings in my size.   Put them in and the reel is mint.   I might try to see if i can find a sealed set and the above locations.  Thanks again!
314084,BillM,2009-03-06 19:07:00,17367," I was going to say Canadian Bearing.  They can get you anything, they'll have to order it in though.  I used to use them for suspension bearings all the time in my dirtbikes.  So much cheaper then OEM (And it's the exact same thing)  They should be able to get you some Barden/F.A.G bearings.."
314091,buckster,2009-03-06 19:15:00,530,Lets just say what a tackle shop was gonna charge me 50 bucks for i got it there for $7.......  and if i wanted the good ones it would be $100 at the tackle shop and hey get this 15 bucks at canadian bearing.  Momma didnt raise no fool! lol
314095,BITEME,2009-03-06 19:31:00,1968,Canadian Bearings is great dealing with them forever cars boats bikes whatever only thing I can tell you is pay the extra money and dont buy the cheaper chinese kife
314096,capt bruce,2009-03-06 19:32:00,820,"Ya i hear ya Buckster , just add the word marine or in this case call it a ""Float reel bearing"" and the price goes thu the roof just call it a bearing and it dont cost near as much, Good for you finding them .."
314546,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-03-07 19:24:00,0,"Lornes reel was a similar knockoff to the stanton, if its the LGcustom 2, which like a stanton was a spoked reel, I believe he also had a streammaster knockoff as well, which was a solid spool, I have a LG2 reel that doesnt free spin like it did when knew, but Im a little older and slower and my brain doesnt work like it use to so me and my LG2 are quite comfortable together."
