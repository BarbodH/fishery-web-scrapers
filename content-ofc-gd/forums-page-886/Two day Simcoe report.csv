We fished in about 93 feet of water and had 3 lakers on the ice in the first hour, all released.  We fished another 3 hours or so and caught 4 more, not too bad of a day, ended up taking one home.  The fish were tight to bottom.         Today we headed back out and I brought my brother and my dad.  The lake was WET today, lots of water on top and rushing into the holes and expanding them.  We all got fish today, nothing huge, but I did manage one nice laker, bigger than the rest.  93 feet again today, but the fish were 4-5 feet off bottom.          "

314405,ehg,2009-03-07 14:07:00,2666,Nice catches as usual! I guess Simcoe has strong ice still judging by your trucks being out there.
