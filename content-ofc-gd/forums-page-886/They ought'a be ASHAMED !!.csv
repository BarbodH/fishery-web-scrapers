My old man always had an old land yaht in the drive way and he could pull a motor and drop a new one in over a weekend easy!  I learned a lot from handing him wrenches and hearing him curse under the car back then, you should hear me swear a song now! lol  About 6 years ago, I had the pleasure of helping an older friend of mine do a frame off restoration on a 1967 rag top pontiac firebird.  That car was amazing and I hope to own it one day. Another friend of mine had a 1969 Judge!  Another awesome car!  Yes...gas guzzling pigs, but you know what?  The things were built to last!  If Americans could put the same pride, styling, and industry leadership in their vehicles today as they did then, we would never be having this discussion!  The real problem for the Big 3 now is the simple fact that their brand value has been tarnished for at least 3 generations!  I am 35, my brother is 8 years older.  Less  and less people of his age will buy the American brands because they have lived through the down fall in the quality of many of their models.  My generation is filled with indivuals who will no longer purchase these vehicles. I hear these oppinions from the people in my age group everyday. Last but not least, the generation that is 8 years younger then me, will not buy the cars because they have heard all the grumblings from those geneartions above them such as my own.  This later generation is the one that will be buying the hottest, newest cars and whats cool for a long time into the future! This is the market they must win if they wish to survive. The Big 3 have a very lofty and difficult road ahead of themselves.  They have to change the way the majority of consumers currently view their product.  Will the bail outs provide them time to do so?  Hard to say for sure!  Ab"
313249,Bernie,2009-03-04 23:03:00,3190,"Over the last 100 or so years manufacturers have come and gone. The strong, good company's survived. They had quality products and stood behind them. The not so good didn't make it. No one bailed them out. It's what makes (or once did make) our country strong, profitable and viable. I am not an economist (who really is one? but thats another story) but to me it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out the bailout is very wrong. If it is deemed necessary to get the economy going again give it to a strong forward thinking company, not a top heavy ""lost it's track"" company with too much baggage."

I cannot remember the last time (if EVER) I heard one of my friends (from 16- 22) talk about buying a GM. It just doesnt happen, kids my age are looking at hondas, mazdas, toyota etc etc. No, we arent buying brand new cars today, but in 3 or 4 years we are out of school and looking at the new car market and GM will NOT be the company we are looking at unless they get it together and FAST.  I think the reason my generation avoids GM is simple, we have watched our parents headaches and cursing when their GMs fell apart for no apparent reason after 50 K.  My mom drives an Aztec, between 80K and 120K she probably spent more on keeping the car on the road than it was worth!  Dad drives a Cadillac CTS 3.8L, TWO read it TWO rear wheel bearings went before 100K.  Why won't I buy a GM?  Its simple, I have never had first hand experience with a GOOD one. The generations above me had years of quality GM cars, and look back on that when making their decision to buy another one even though the last one was crap... ""All my GMs were good maybe the last one was a fluke""  I dont have that experience to drawn on when making a decision about a car, all I know is bad cars. Same with my friends, mostly bad experiences with family cars.

This does not apply to original warranted parts you are not paying for. But in the case of parts replaced under an extended warranty they are yours as well because you paid for the warranty. In the case that the part being replaced has a core charge you would need to pay that amount to keep the part. I don't care for R&R ""technicians"" either Wayne. Often they are doing it in that manner because they don't understand how to diagnose the issue or do not have the proper tools and information."

Most of the problems you will have with your vehicle will be a outsourced part. Sum of the problem will be how the vehicle is driven and maintained.  eg; a friends car wore out the left upper control arm. The bushing was wore.No problem,pull the control arm and replace with a higher quality bushing. A year later it's shot again. Friend ask if I can fix it again,But it's so bad he can't bring me the car.  So I'm thinking to myself that I might have kinked the bushing in installation. I get over to his house and notice a worn patch of lawn a the curb, he has been driving over the curb to make it easier to get out. problem solved. Replace bushing and tell to stop going over the curb.  If you only fix it and not solve the problem. Nothing is going to stay fixed.  If you are going through brakes so fast. maybe you should take your foot of the accelerator before you get to the stop sign.  All the problems can't be blamed of the tech. the training program isn't all that good. they follow shop rules. To most factors, It come down to how much the tech truly know. In technical trades, knowledge come from experience."

Had more new GM and Ford trucks and cars including Saturns that I can remember. The early Saturns were good vehicles. Now they are just another GM product who shares parts with other GM vehicles.  June '07 I purchased my first ""foriegn"" vehicle. However, it was built in Indiana, USA. This Toyota Tundra blows away any Ford or GM truck I ever had. Almost 2 years old and it has never been back to the dealer. I might have trouble finding the dealer it's been that long ago.  When I purchased a NEW vehicle from Ford or GM I was always going back for some kind of warranty word and then most times it wasn't done correctly the first time. Got tired of that Bull. I'm sure they practiced what I call ""The Wear Down Factor"" where they just wear you down bring your vehicle in for whatever warranty service. Once the truck was parked EXACTLY the way I left it in the exact same parking spot when I picked it up. They NEVER call you when the vehicle is done so you had to always call and be left on hold waiting to find out if your truck was repaired.  Like I said, no more of that Bull.

These are machines, which need continually repair...  The one reason people complain about how much it costs to get their car fixed is because of the fact that they have to have someone else do it.  It costs a lot of money for the training to become a mechanic, to build a repair shop, to purchase tools, diagnostic equipment, and to keep up to the current industry standards.  We chose dealerships to do repairs because they are UP TO DATE.  Take your car to BOBS AUTO REPAIR, he is 60 and still turning a wrench, but he has no idea what to do with the computer system under your hood and left off the catalytic converter when he put on your new muffler, because you really just don't need it... You get what you pay for...  All that said, I drive a 2004 DODGE RAM Laramie, and let me tell you it costs money to keep it running well.  It goes to the dealer because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road due to the fact that someone didn't tighten the lug bolts on my tire properly ... I need the piece of mind that comes with knowing that the men and women that serve me are educated and work to industry standards... not to mention the awesome customer service I always get!

I dont drive anything fancy, a 2003 Chevy Venture which thankfully hasnt given me any major problems to date.  The following evening I noticed that when my lights came on, I had the small blue light in the dash come on indicating my high beams were on even though they were not. I then realized that the passenger headlamp high beam did not work.  So, I says to myself, I'll bring it back in to the dealership to have a look as I did not have this problem prior to taking it in. After 20 mins or so, the service agent comes to me and tells me I will need a new headlight assembly.......and they could do it for.......you ready for this........ FOUR HUNDRED + dollars all included (Parts and Labour).  I nearly CRAPPIED myself!!  I then told them I could not justify dropping 4 clams on a head light assembly and asked them to prepare the vehicle as I was leaving. 10 mins later the same agent comes back to me in and states they could put a used one in for approx 300 + dollars , all in. I  said thanks but no thanks....took my vehicle and left with my head shaking.  I made a few calls to some friends and we began our search for a used assemlby from a scrap yard. As luck would have it, my buddy was in one this afternoon and noticed a ruined Chevy Venture with a perfect front end.  He asked how much for the head lamp assembly and is told $75 bucks. Needless to say, he snags it for me and we head to my buddy's place to try and install it.  On the ride over to my buddy's place I asked him what kind of tools we would need to install it. He says to me  ""Just make sure you bring two fingers""!! I think hes kidding but boy was I wrong.  We get to my buddy's place late this evening and commence changing the headlight assemlby. Can you believe it took us 20 minutes to change it completely and we use ABSOLUTELY  NO TOOLS !!! 3 little plastic screws held it all together !! and it works.....GOOD AS NEW!! 75 bucks VS   $400+ is one hell of a discount !!!

311315,TennesseeGuy,2009-02-27 03:13:00,957,"Hey Spiel, I got a recall notice for those items on my 2006 Toyota Sienna.  Will get them replaced free at the next oil change.  Same thing might have been available for her dad's van."
311319,holdfast,2009-02-27 03:16:00,1813,"$600 for my Fuel pump in my Ford Ranger at 112,000KM. Dispicable.  I want my money back from the Taxes that keep these companies going and the High Salaried Employees.  Pisss on them.  Buy Jap."
311321,douG,2009-02-27 03:22:00,2693,"I agree, Holdfast, with a Toyota, Maz and Hyundai in the driveway.  I have never been happier."
311362,buckster,2009-02-27 05:59:00,530,Wow what a discount....... All that money saved i wont feel guilty when buy tims for the rest of the season!
311367,hammercarp,2009-02-27 06:37:00,964,It's the 500 rule. If you bring your vehicle into a dealership you don't get out without spending at least $500.
311368,Sinker,2009-02-27 07:23:00,8692,A dealership is the very last place I'd take my vehicle!
311379,outllaw,2009-02-27 10:48:00,1232,im chuckling. my nephew is still paying down his honda bill.
311380,Spiel,2009-02-27 11:03:00,9065, Thanks for the heads up TG. I know it's an older vehicle but I'll pass the word along.
311381,fishinfool,2009-02-27 11:04:00,366,"Unbelievable, I just got rid of my Chevy Silverado HD and decided to go with a Nissan Maxima. I miss the truck but I'm guessing that I will save in the long run."
311383,sandybay,2009-02-27 11:26:00,64,"When I got my 06 Yukon I got the extended warranty when the girl said it covered brakes. 65000 kms back brakes go. Pads and rotors, check my warranty I have $100.00 deductable and rotors not covered. Must use GM parts, GM rotors $235.00 each total so for $570.00 without taxes and labour. Needlessly to say fixed it myself with aftermarket parts for $155.00 and 90 minutes of my time. Oh yeh the dealer is a buddy of mine."
311392,Fisherman,2009-02-27 12:14:00,7201,"But maybe someone can explain to me what the headlamp assembly has to do with the functioning of the bulb itself?  If I take a functioning bulb assembly out of my car or truck, it will still work.  There's nothing electrical to connect bulb and headlight assembly, just a place where the bulb sits. The ground, high and lowbeam and signal/park light wires connect directly to the bulb."
311407,limeyangler,2009-02-27 13:14:00,5204,"  Thats what i thought....I'm in Dryden, GM rips you off Here, and all three main garages...oooops 2....one went out of business, rip you off!"
311430,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-27 14:19:00,2582, Good luck with that theory. Cause if all the local shops close up...you'll be driving to Richmond Hill for car repairs too  There are good guys everywhere....and crooks everywhere. If you find a garage that gives you a square deal stick with em.
311478,Ramble,2009-02-27 16:17:00,713,My partents Impala breaks went after 60 000 km on it. That was a year ago and my dad is still P. O.ed at them for that. They have bought north american their entire lives and i thnk this car is the last.  -R-
311496,LeXXington,2009-02-27 17:07:00,1928,"I am not sure if its only North American cars that do the rip off, but yes they do break down  more.  I had a single older woman come to see me balling her eye's out she had gone too the dealer to have something small fixed. The bill came to 1200.00 and she was crying cause it cleared out her savings.  I looked at the bill, saw that they did the full works, even stuff that she could have put off. She called the dealer spoke to the manager and got a 400- discount (had to charge for some parts)  I was disguested that they would take advantage of someone like that, and I bet the knew what they were doing.  Yep, my tax dollars helping this industry ....."
311648,Abraxus,2009-02-27 21:26:00,104,"I will never buy American again.  I now own a Nissan Pathfinder. It is a 2002 and I have put 170k on the vehicle.  Other then the regular oil changes and maintenance such as brakes and fluids, I have done absolutely nothing with the car!  It runs just like the day I bought it!  I tow a larger boat, and ATV all the time. I am always amazed by the fact that the car has never changed and the motor has never run any different from the day I purchased it!  Pure quality hands down!  With previous American cars I have owned, 150km was the magic number.  I would be replacing something new every month from that milage forward.  Never again!"
311662,Big Cliff,2009-02-27 22:01:00,6899,"My wife's Mazda 626 is 10 years old, total repair costs to date $815.00 and that includes replacing the belts an O2 sensor (they were 10 years old and the belts had started to dry out, I had them replaced as a precaution), and an intake manifold gasket, a couple of hanger brackets on the exhaust system. Apart from that, just the usual lube, oil, filter stuff. Oh, and when it is running and you are standing right beside it, you can't hear it, the windows don't rattle when you close the doors, and everything still works on it. Try that with anything the big three put out!  I have been driving a Nissan X-Trail for three years now and love it, the lease is up on it in Oct. and I am so pleased with the quality and the service from the local dealership that I think I am just going to buy it at the end of the lease. The last Ford I had was in such bad shape after three years that I almost had to give it away, it was going to need almost $3000.00 in repairs and I take very good care of my stuff mechanically.  I was just reading an article on GM written in 2008 and it stated that with paid time off, benifits, wages, and pensions the average cost of labour is $74.00/hr and good old Buzz was stating that there was now way they were going to make any consessions to GM. Funny, now he wants to be part of the solution! Go figure. Buzz, I think you've killed the golden goose!  Does anyone wonder why Honda, Nissan, Toyota, aren't standing in line looking for a few billion to bail them out?"
311668,johnnyb,2009-02-27 22:12:00,3413,"Man...I hate getting in on these kind of topics, but, slamming the US automakers is just a bunch of    IMHO.  I'm so sick of hearing about it....the day a car company sells a vehicle and doesn't need a service department is the day I'll buy into all the propaganda. As IF Honda Nissan Toyota aren't in trouble...the whole industry is in trouble because...oh yeah...the whole world's economy is in trouble.  It has so very little to do with product and so very much to do with credit and a crippled economy that has been built on buying more and more and more...and economy that devalues the very things it wants you to buy, as soon as you've bought them. Sorry...haven't even read most of this post...but the tidbits I see just got me to the point where I couldn't resist."
311670,Burtess,2009-02-27 22:15:00,901," Lets not knock the NA brands too much.  There are some good out there.  Here is my story:  2001 Buick Century, bought it brand new.  In 390K I replaced the brakes 4 times (myself), broke one coil spring, and a catalytic converter.  Absolutely fantastic car.  Never failed to start, never let me down.  Sold it to a customer, and his son-in-law is still driving it! Now I drive a 2004 Buick LeSabre, 125K, done the brakes once, nothing else so far.......  Burt"
311677,hotrod,2009-02-27 22:29:00,103,It's a myth the foreign companies aren't hurting also. Another thing to take into consideration when talking about the foreign companies here in Canada and the 74$/hour figure is their workforce hasn't really started retiring and therefore they haven't had to make any pension payments like the big three have yet. As for me I will NEVER buy a foreign vehicle ever.
