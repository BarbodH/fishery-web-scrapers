314565,GoneFishin,2009-03-07 21:17:00,349,Well it rained a lot today but with the temperature being 5 degrees I couldn't stay in. Was out for about 2 hours and got this nice brown in the first 10 minutes. Luckily I remembered to bring my camera. I'm sure it won't hold up to long but here is one for Team 2!
