314170,Leecher,2009-03-06 23:18:00,7832,"Well guys, since today was my day off, the plan was for me to get out onto the hard water and spend some quality time teasing the fish  Last night's forecast didn't look to promising.... they were calling for 5-10cm of snow overnight and turning to freezing rain early morning and then rain..... let just say I got up later than usual and did not target my favorite lake for pickeral, instead went to Casino Lac Leamy and had a lot of fun  Temperature was -2C, heavy overcast and looked like the rain was going to come down but that did not happen     Instead as soon as I got up, had a coffee and started preparing my fishing gear for this outing.  Left home at 9:45am, got to the lake at around 10:00am and not a soul to be seen.... had the lake to myself and was real happy about that.  Once I arrived, snapped a pic of the casino, where I was fishing and the setup I had.  Here are the pics:  First the Casino    Then where I was fishing, in front of a creek, leading to the Gatineau river in 10 - 15 fow on a drop off over a weed bed    and last my setup.... jigging rod, the manual 6"" auger and the rest of the gear    Just could not ask for more.... I managed to catch a few small perch and had a lot of hits & misses throughout my stay.   Had a huge fish hit my jigging lure out of nowhere and lost it near the hole.... did not see what it was but figured it was a pike, with the runs and head shake it gave.  All in all caught 4 perch and lost a snot rocket near the hole. Had a great time and at 2:30pm call it a day, had to get back home to prepare diner. All fish were CPR'd.... here is the rest of the pics  First perch    Second one    Third    and fourth    Hope you enjoy Leechman"
314180,Greencoachdog,2009-03-06 23:41:00,8163,Thanks for that report Jacques!!!  I take it that's a hotel on top of the casino?  I love it when I have the whole lake to myself!... nice and quiet!!!  It sounds like that big fish added to the excitement of the day!
314182,waterwolf,2009-03-06 23:47:00,556,"real nice to get out on warm days and put a few on the ice .  too bad that big mystery fish got loose!!  damn!~  you know he's there ,,, get 'im next time !!  ps. hands fine , thanks."

314208,bigugli,2009-03-07 00:34:00,6138,"Good you got out.  No white stripe either.  ME, I had chores to do so i can get out Sunday."
314222,Leecher,2009-03-07 01:13:00,7832," Thanks Glen.... The hotel is right beside the casino but looks on top of it.... I was at the opposite side of the lake on the north side.  Had a peaceful time today.... not a soul to be seen but just wish that I could move the 50 (highway) dawn noise from traffic    It's the only noise other than the birds I could hear from where I was LOL  Yeah that bigger fish caught me be surprise and was not keeping a tight line.... that is how it got away   and it sure brough excitement and got me to stay a little longer.   Thanks waterwolf... It was nice and cozy to be out in warmer temps and no wind or barely a breeze..... I just might go back tomorrow morning to see if I can get him again and may be land him Glad to hear that you did not have any serious injury to your hand   Yeah I know Drew.... almost as big as the lure LOL   Had the day off, but last night's forecast didn't give me any reason to get up early and go fish into freezing rain  Wish I had waken early but instead went to Leamy for a few hours and yes, got to go for some whities this Sunday for sure Will talk soon about   Thanks Bruce.... Good luck on Sunday, will be keeping an eye out for your report"

314410,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-07 14:15:00,2585,thanks for sharing bet they were yummy  cheers!
314469,Leecher,2009-03-07 16:26:00,7832, Thanks LBH... they would of been had I not released them!!
314470,limeyangler,2009-03-07 16:34:00,5204,"Nice one Jacques,   I am amazed those perch you catch hit such large baits, ours up here will occasionally do that, but they are more often than not really finnicky.   I am also a big fan of those 'fishfry' your using."
314473,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-07 16:39:00,1362,"Hey Jacques....nice ""fishfry"" mon chum  ....  Enjoyed your report....when are you coming out here for some Pike and Walleye action??"
314483,Leecher,2009-03-07 17:10:00,7832," Thanks Simon.... I'm amazed too.  So small and yet, can swallow the fish fry including the treble hook The thing is that I'm not targeting them and somehow catch them anyway.... go figure  When I do target them, I usually rig a small jig head tipped with Gulp fish fry.... real deadly combination  Talk about the fry.... started to use it this season and I'm a big fan also..... that stuff is potent and really works wonders!!     Thanks Steve.... don't know but will have to be soon.... and when I do, would like to be out all day     I just might take another day off next week and will call you.  Are you coming to 31 Mile lake tomorrow for some whities??"
314485,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-07 17:17:00,1362," My buddies are having a big derby out here on the river tomorrow....check your PM  ...  Should be between 120-150 people out...tons of door prizes including 4 Sens tickets and it's only $10 entry fee which also gets you a hotdog, hamburg, salad, chips and a drink for lunch...there'll be cash prizes ...~$400 for each top 3 fish caught.....  "
314490,Leecher,2009-03-07 17:35:00,7832, Sounds like fun but where bouts on the river?  is it in the bay in front of your house?   Did not get your pm yet!!
314730,Mike the Pike,2009-03-08 03:21:00,3421,Well Jacques great mini report unfortunately I won't have to to hook up with you and the gang on the ice this year  Finishing off my garage has been rather time consuming.So perhaps this summer we can hook up.  Must be nice to leave home and be on the water in only 15 mins wow.
314739,Leecher,2009-03-08 03:59:00,7832," Thanks Mike.... I certainly understand the hard work that is involved in undertaking home renovations.  Hope that you can finish the project and enjoy the end results.  As for hard water fishing, well you know that it wont  be here for too long.  I was certainly looking forward to meeting you this winter for some hard water action.  Alas it will have to wait til summer.  I know exactly where to go for some good fishing.  Lac St-Marie is a favorite lake of mine come soft water and let me tell you that you won't regret it.  Yeah Lac Leamy is only a short drive away from my place and it's a great place to target when you don't want to drive too far Until then... tight lines Jacques"
