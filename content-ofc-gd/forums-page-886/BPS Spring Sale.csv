314742,waterwolf,2009-03-08 04:17:00,556,"visited the big classic today and had a great time spending\saving money. lol lots of deals on a variety of things i did'n't need ,,,, but having too many is always better than the alternative. grabbed some rubber swimbaits ,which are new tackle for me , a cheap back-up reel,just 'cause, some trout spinners and a few booyah spinnerbaits. a net, trailer hooks for the spinnerbaits , a bunch of storm lures and acouple packs of stren sonic braid.  everything was on sale so it didn't hurt too much. wasn't all that busy there at 3:30 so parking wasn't the usual nightmare.  depending on how late i stay on simcoe tomorrow i might stop in again on the way home,,, just'cause."
314750,Cudz,2009-03-08 06:11:00,2652,"I managed to drop 2 hun there this morning.  I got most of what I was looking for including a reel, a bunch of treble hooks for my cranks, a net, a digital scale, some line, a few crankbaits, a double bucktail spinner and a claking rap.  Would have loved to shop more but I was alone and have 3 very active daughters of which the eldest is 7 and the youngest is 2.  That in itself was a full time job.  They were pretty good because I told them we would go the build-a-bear store if they behaved. I will have to make it back there during March break."
314752,Stern Rules,2009-03-08 08:13:00,342,"Yeah I spent $350 there. Got 14 spools of that Rapala line that was on for $1.99. What a deal. Got 35 of the PM spinners, a couple baitcasting rods  and that gripmaster with scale and a few other things for the guys down home. Too bad they didn't have the frenzy's on again this year. Lots of wiggle o's left but I stocked up on those last year."
314845,EC1,2009-03-08 17:17:00,930,"Is that Rapala Line any good? They were all in weird pound tests - 17 , 20 , 14, and the lightest I found was 10.  But I guess at 1.99 even if it is terrible you didn't waste too much money."
314885,Stern Rules,2009-03-08 19:21:00,342,I'm not sure how good a line it is but Rapala is a good brand so I bought some. You really had to dig to find lighter line. I found some 4 and 6 lb tough and long cast. Didn't see any 8 at all.
315035,Stoty,2009-03-09 02:30:00,2910,"I got there Friday afternoon, so there was a great selection of the line. I picked up 10 spools. 6, 10, 14 lbs test. Its pretty good line (for mono). Unreal deal though eh."
315043,tomO,2009-03-09 03:10:00,363,"I used the rapala line a few years ago and hated it , it broke really easy."
315046,beertech,2009-03-09 03:30:00,118,I bought one spool aswell. Just bought mine for backing for braid. For 2 bucks its perfect.
315063,Stoty,2009-03-09 05:40:00,2910," oh really? I've used it on my mono rods for a couple years now, never had a problem. bad batch maybe?"
315068,Rich,2009-03-09 10:03:00,3927,I found the abrasion resistance and stretch in the Rapala line kinda blew. Once it stretched out (which happened pretty quick) it was useless.  But for 2 bucks... why not?
