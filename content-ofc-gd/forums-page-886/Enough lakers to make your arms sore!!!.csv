I was excited to hit the lake this morning having a feeling that it could be a great day with the weather front we had moving in. and it didn't disappoint. we fished 95fow and for a couple hours the lakers were totally suicidal. I hooked 5 fish in less then 20 min.  Dan and I iced nearly 30 fish between the 2 of us and a few of my other buddies iced a bunch too.  just a great day out there. Nothing too big but steady action none the less. The fish shut down about a hour before the rain started and we headed out. All fish came on tubes.  heres some pics from the day     Dan with a bunch        and a few for me.....         weescot with one     Matt with a couple, his first ever whitie     Bruce with one  "
