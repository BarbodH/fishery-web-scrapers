314384,danbouck,2009-03-07 13:34:00,4380,I watch it once in a while but I can't stand the yelling!
314393,kickingfrog,2009-03-07 13:53:00,8333," I'll say the same thing my wife tells me when I'm watching hockey: ""You know they can't hear you, no matter how loud you yell?"""
314406,JohnAB,2009-03-07 14:10:00,178,Watching curling on TV takes away my will to live so I avoid it like the plague!  But to each their own as they say.
314418,MAzing,2009-03-07 14:34:00,43,"If it was me they couldn't go away fast enough. Damn TSN has that stuff on all the prime times and I can't watch sportsdesk. Just this monday I jumped up in bed with a loud cheer, my wife awoke and asked what was up, I told her it had been over a week since I got to watch my sportsdesk. I watch sportsdesk at 11 pm and 6 am every day except when the stupid curling is around. And the other sports channels are unpredictable and no were near as good as TSN.  The morons at TSN actually cut into the end of the Nascar race last week to start the curling!!!!!!!!!!!! Could they not of taped delay it? You can't tell me there's more people watching curling then Nascar, if so we've got a big problem.  I actually started to scream Tuesday night when I saw the Brier is about to start so I guess I'll be another week without my sportsdesk."
