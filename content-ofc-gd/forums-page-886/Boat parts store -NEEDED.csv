314233,mbac31,2009-03-07 01:27:00,904,Rigging Shoppe West Marine on lakeshore Total Marine at Scarborough Bluffs. Whitby Marine has alot of hard to find items as well.
314433,Woodsman,2009-03-07 14:55:00,1286,Check out your local UAP/NAPA store. Ask to see their marine catalouge. Not likely they will stock the parts but can order them in at a price better than most places. Expect 3 days delivery if in the Canadian warehouse & about 3 weeks if it has to come out of the US.
