I'm wondering if anyone knows if any of the bodies of water (Guelph lake, moutsberg ect.) are thawed at all or if anyone has a suggestion of any spots whihc might be suitable. Any suggestions much appreciated."

314205,jediangler,2009-03-07 00:31:00,1923,"Both Guelph and Mountsberg lakes are good for pike fishing, once they thaw out. Mountsberg doesn't open for fishing until pike opener so you'll have to wait till May. Guelph may have some spots you can shore fish after this weekend as the ice melts. Try the Grand river almost anywhere from shore."
