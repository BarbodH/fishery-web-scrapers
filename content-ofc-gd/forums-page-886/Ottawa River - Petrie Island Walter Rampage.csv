315004,Seaweed,2009-03-09 01:11:00,135,Well we hit Petrie again on Saturday morning.  We did great fish wise. First line down caught a small one pound walleye... must have been an omen for things to come because we then scored two really respectable Ottawa River eyes all caught between 8:30 - 10:00.  The two big ones went back due to the slot size of 15.8 inches.  Figures we would start to catch the big fish now.  I did however go home with four other fish for the frying pan. All in all a great day.  Sunday I only managed three small sauger.  I could not believe it ... there was about four feet of ice.  4.5 pounder   6.5 pounder   Looks like the fish have the feedbag on ... everyone with March break should be into some good fish... I'll be at work but plan on getting out in the later afternoon.
