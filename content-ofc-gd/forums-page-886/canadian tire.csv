314576,Fisherpete,2009-03-07 21:47:00,1814,"Well, I have a HAPPY Cdn Tire story today...  I started checking online last night around midnight, and supposedly the Markham & Lawrence location in Scarborough had all 5 Jiffy models that Cdn Tire carries in stock... all the other stores around my area were either out of stock or ""call store for details"". I had my doubts, but just the same was there this morning as they opened the doors at 9am... there were about 50 people lined up outside just waiting to get in... I thought ""This feels a lot like Boxing Day!"" and watched a bunch of them literally run into the store, but WOOHOO none of them went towards the ice fishing section  They DID have all 5 models in stock... exactly one of each model... including the one I wanted - the 3hp STX 10"" for $274.99... SWEET! They also had lots of 5"", 6"" and 8"" swedebore manual augers too for $35... I almost bought one as a backup! Had about a dozen rod & reel combos available... a few shelters (Frabill Outback?) They had the sleds too, a few pairs of the ice cleats and tons of lures & ice line too!  So...  $375 later, I have a brand new kick-bum auger, a half-dozen new lures, some Power Pro Ice line, a new sled, a HT rod bag and one sweet set of HT ice cleats. SOMEONE MAKE THE RAIN STOP AND TURN THE THERMOSTAT BACK DOWN OUTSIDE PLEASE!!!!! It'll be pretty sad if I don't even get a chance to fire that puppy up before the season ends!"
314579,bbog,2009-03-07 21:56:00,665,Glad one of our own got it!  Don't you just love the power of our community?

314413,cranks bait,2009-03-07 14:23:00,721,"I've run into this problem too many times with CTC.  The last one being when they had their hunting sale.  Not a freakin thing in the department, although the stuff I was after was in stock five minutes earlier on the site.  I went right to the top and went so far as to mention the misrepresentation of the company and that it was an illegal.  They told me to contact the owner of the store here.  Of course I never got a return call.  What a joke.  If I ran my business like that I would be under so fast it would be unbelievable.   CTC is becoming more and more just another box store that offers a bunch of nothing, just like the rest of them.  Too bad, I used to really enjoy going there.  In the last couple of years, not so much.  More of a pain in the butt than anything."
314429,GeorgeJ,2009-03-07 14:50:00,207,"I managed to get a 8"" for $224 last night. I checked inventory on line first at home got there nothing was out, all the ice fishing stuff had been put away. I explained the situation to the kid working there he goes into the back storage room and returns about 5 minutes later with a brand new in the box Jiffy Ice auger. Now I'm already looking forward to next winter!"
314436,irishfield,2009-03-07 15:03:00,26272,"Now Terry...we all agreed we wouldn't have this tantrum over a CLEARANCE sale! lol  Like George .. all I did last year was ask as the power augers are always in the warehouse... other than the display.  You want me to hit the Midland store and see if they still have one? Shows the Stealth STX 10"" in stock and the Jiffy 30 10"" in stock as of yesterday."
314438,Terry,2009-03-07 15:05:00,14456,sure let me know thanks
314439,irishfield,2009-03-07 15:07:00,26272,Which one do you want 1st.. the Stealth or the Jiffy 30. Will you take either? I'll hit the road and buy which ever one I can get if so.
314445,Terry,2009-03-07 15:12:00,14456,"I don't know which is better so 10"" 3 hp is all I am worried about thanks"
314446,irishfield,2009-03-07 15:13:00,26272,"Stealth has a 3 year warrantee... I'm out the door, will see what I can get. Should have gone last night....."
314454,Terry,2009-03-07 15:43:00,14456,ok
314480,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-07 17:05:00,0,  that is why you should have gone as soon as you got the flyer!!!  at all ctc stores the sale price for saturday is put on the items usually around lunchtime the day before the sale starts  everyone I know knows about this and goes for staurday sale stuff on friday and are never dissapointed  and even if the price has not been marked down ctc give you 14 days for price adjustment  so buy it at full price and go back and get your money back  wal mart/home depot have a 30 day price guarantee along with many other major retailers
314486,F7Firecat,2009-03-07 17:23:00,347,ct sux ass period
314493,irishfield,2009-03-07 17:35:00,26272,"Well Terry......                                                You're the proud popa of a brand new 3HP Jiffy 30 x 10"" auger      Took some work.. and me going right into the warehouse myself.. and borrowing a gas cap and handle from elsewhere... but it's done. Now if anyone else goes there to buy the 3HP - 8"" be forewarned.... it's handleless ! lol  Now for all the na-sayers... did ya wanna give me your shopping list for next March???"
314496,osmondrs,2009-03-07 17:44:00,61,"Got suckered by CT - YET ONCE AGAIN!!  Saw the flyer last night & got tempted by ""fishfinders 1/2 price"".  Got to the Cedarbrea CT barely minutes after opening & went straight to the fishing section.  All finders are under lock & key, so the mission was to find someone to open the display cabinet (took 25 minutes - don't ask me how).  Off-the cuff answer: ""no fishfinders on sale!"".  Well, after showing thim the flyer, and pointing to one solitary sign announcing one finder on sale at half price, the guy decides to look into it.  I needed a portable one, so we start searching for one.  1st, not on sale: 2nd, not on sale: 3rd, not on sale.  Probably the guy started feeling sorry for me and offered to look for one he thought might be on sale.  Answer, ten minutes later, ""out of stock"".  Check other stores: no store in Ontario has one!!  Go figure!  Just like Terry, feel better now - but only slightly, though.  Os"
314499,smokin joe,2009-03-07 17:47:00,226,WTG man!!!  Glad to see someone helping someone else out  Congrats Terry on the new auger  I got one too but the handle and gas cap were missing  Seriously though it's always a great feeling when you can help someone else
314500,Terry,2009-03-07 17:48:00,14456,what can I say   thanks  can you hold it till Nov.       LOL  just kidding
314501,irishfield,2009-03-07 17:49:00,26272,10% per month compounded daily...   ...oh and maybe you pay for all the damn lures I bought standing there waiting for the kids the first 10 minutes....
314509,Terry,2009-03-07 17:54:00,14456,did they have ice fishing lures
314514,irishfield,2009-03-07 17:58:00,26272,"Pegs and pegs and pegs full of them.. .Williams, Buckshots, Rapala, Swedish Pimple, ice jigs.. you name it. You can stop in on your way out of my place tomorrow !"
314515,Spiel,2009-03-07 17:59:00,9065,"I don't care what anyone says Wayne, you're a hell of a nice guy."
314517,Terry,2009-03-07 18:01:00,14456,you are right    and where else but OFC  so tomorrow and bring lots of money for lures......LOL

314523,bbog,2009-03-07 18:21:00,665,"As of 20 minutes ago, Pickering Parkway store had a 3HP Jiffy in 8"" (new in sealed box so hope it has the handle and gas cap).  If you want it call ahead and have them hold it. (905) 686-2308.  Guess if I was as nice as Wayne I'd pick it up and hold it for you..."
314526,Terry,2009-03-07 18:25:00,14456,"LOL Wayne got me one, so I am good I don't need two  that's all I need, ten people getting them for me ....LOL"

314528,irishfield,2009-03-07 18:29:00,26272,Hard to go to an 8 inch after using 9's and 10's.. sounds funny but it is. I'm sure some of the gals understand better..
