314412,MAzing,2009-03-07 14:23:00,43,"Do you have a TV in your bedroom? If not make sure you do. My wife likes to watch desperate housewifes every sunday night and I haven't missed an episode since the start.     I'm sure sex in the city should have the same effect on your better half.  So every Sunday night I'm in bed by 9 sharp, well most nights now as I'm the desperate one."
314440,Ramble,2009-03-07 15:07:00,713,Take up fly fishing and learn to tie your own flies. You can spend hours at it. It's a fantastic time killer and doesnt take up much space. You can fit all the stuff in a rubbermaid container. It's awesome for combating boredom in the winter as well as bad TV.  There is nothing wrong wih reading either. Get a library card. Get a guitar...learn to play. There is LOTS of stuff you can do. I hardly watch TV anymore. Most of my free time is either guitar/reading/computer. Age of Empires 2 for the PC is a fantastic time killer lol.  -Dave

I was just curious, What do you do while your significant other is watching "" their"" show  ? I have a few fishing shows that my wife cant seem to stand, and she has a few that I can bare to watch haha  At the moment, the wife is just finishing up a 3 hr run of ""Sex In The City"" leaving me with not much else to do... we live in an apartment... so its not like I can go out in the shop or the garage ya know ? hahaha I find myself on the computer a lot. Or reading, or maybe, JUST maybe.... if I can handle it... I sit in on an episode or 2 hahahah Only when there hasnt been a new post on OFC for 10 mins or so.  So what does everyone else do during that time ?"
313261,douG,2009-03-04 23:46:00,2693,Get some lotion and give her a hand and foot massage.  Who knows what might happen.  There are lots of things that can distract me from my favourite tv show.  Make it happen.

313264,rbaquial,2009-03-04 23:49:00,968,"LoL! Awesome tip douG!  Hahaha, I should give that a shot!  I'm normally on the computer, I don't watch as much TV as I used to anymore. I'm more so on the internet researching stuff (mostly fishing) or looking for funny videos on BREAK.COM. I'll admit, on occasion I will sit with the wife and watch whatever show she's watching... just to get in some ""couple"" time...lol, yah - I have a softside... LEAVE ME ALONE!"

Instead of Sex In The City, insert some Antonio Banderas movie.  Comic was bent out of shape at having to go see chick flicks with his wife, til the day he finally figured it out.  At the end of the movie, she's all wound up, and Antonio's nowhere to be found.  Hmm.  Guess who's right there handy?   ...Exactly.  Keep quiet, stay outta view til the final credits are winding up, and for god's sake don't fart or mention Bass Pro on your way back into the living room.  You don't wanna shatter"
