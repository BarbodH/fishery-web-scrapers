I've never fished in the area and could really use some tips as to successful baits/lures/presentations/etc.  We're planning to hit the water on canoes.  Any comments would be very much appreciated!"
314399,rockfish,2009-03-07 13:57:00,91,I've fished Little Glamor a few yrs ago and crayfish were the top bait for big Smallies around the rocky areas close to shore. I'd imagine that Big Glamor has pretty well the same structure. There is a small dam between the 2 lakes that u can carry a canoe around pretty easily. Minnow imitation cranks were also working for us. Good luck.
