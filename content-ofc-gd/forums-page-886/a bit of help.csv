311678,Leecher,2009-02-27 22:30:00,7832," Click on the multi quote button at the bottom right of a reply box and when you are finished, go to the very end of the thread and click on reply."
311679,johnnyb,2009-02-27 22:32:00,3413, That's a good question...I don't know either    Shoot Jacques...you're the man!  I'm gonna try it!  Hot dang -- it works!
311680,BassAsin,2009-02-27 22:34:00,806," excellent, thanks"
311685,Radnine,2009-02-27 22:51:00,1538,I still don't get it.
311687,Leecher,2009-02-27 22:58:00,7832," Radnine,  When you open a thread to read it,  at the bottom right of the box, there is a multi + button and if you click on it, it will change to multi -  Keep going down the thread and select other ones and when you finish, go to the very bottom and click on the reply button.  You will see all of the quote that you have selected the same way as if you were simply replying to a post  Give it a try... If you still don't get it, I'll try and get a screen capture of how it's done Jacques"
311812,Sinker,2009-02-28 04:16:00,8692,"I don't have a multi button?? I have ""quote"", ""reply"", ""top"" buttons. Where is it supposed to be?? I've always wondered how you do it too......  Sinker"
311862,Jer,2009-02-28 13:50:00,1426,"    ...cool...depending on your skin, the button might only say ""quote""..."
311880,Leecher,2009-02-28 15:02:00,7832," Sinker, change your default skin to OFC Club and the multi quote button will appear.  Gave that a try. LM"
