Just blast 1/2 cup milk in the microwave till it just boils then use the Expresso pack for the Tassimo right into the milk in the cup.  Tastes better, its hotter and almost free!."
314992,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-09 00:42:00,4399,I have a Bosch model and I like it just fine and yes the discs cost more than regular coffee but certainly less than the coffee shops.
