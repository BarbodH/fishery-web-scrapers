314970,irishfield,2009-03-08 23:33:00,26272,I'll be driving my truck to the dock on Tuesday... and the neighbour will be doing the same well into April I bet. Hard to get good advise without naming the lake.
314973,Fisherman,2009-03-08 23:36:00,7201,"That sounds like a question from someone that lives at _______.  How on earth is anyone going to give you the thumbs up that in 2 weeks, the ice is going to be ""safe"".  It might be safe right now, but rain, rising water, sunny days can change that.  How be try a couple days before you go."
314980,Bernie,2009-03-08 23:55:00,3190,Yep and even then you need to be careful. I drove my truck on known safe travel areas today but a sled came in on Saturday that was a few feet under. You have to know what you are doing.
