I am going a bit stir crazy, but not much i can do about it. My wife is fantastic....she is taking it all in her stride, although her stride is more like a duck waddle these days.   Got up this morning, beautiful day, sunny, -15 C, no wind.......lol....guess what i'm thinking   Funnily enough i think my cat had the same idea......      GOING........          GOING....................          COME ON LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!        Nice try cat, but alas i dont think so...maybe....maybe...tomorrow       ."
