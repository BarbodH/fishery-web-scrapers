312647,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 04:53:00,0,that's a big ol' lush!
312650,hammercarp,2009-03-02 05:07:00,964,Wow what a beast. Congradulations.
312683,solopaddler,2009-03-02 11:26:00,8605,"That's one huge freshwater cod, very impressive! Did you batter him up?"
312686,Spiel,2009-03-02 11:42:00,9065,"Sweet jump'n Jesus, that's one big ling. I've only seen one comparable in my life, a buddy caught it off the mouth of the Bighead river and it was as long as his leg. It sure looked old with all sorts of battle scars (possibly from gill nets encounters?), anyhow we realeased it without any measurements taken. Congrats, it's truly a hog!"
312698,b2kptbo,2009-03-02 12:22:00,1505,"WOW a hugh ling, looks like your holding a gator..."
312702,Greencoachdog,2009-03-02 12:46:00,8163,Excellent report!!! and Congratulations on catching a real trophy fish!!!  You have some good fish karma coming your way for releasing that big Momma fish!!!  She was in shallow to breed now!  Thanks again for those excellent pics!!!
312723,Governator,2009-03-02 13:39:00,879,"That is awesome, I've never seen one and probably would've freaked me out if I caught that.  ""Oh I'm recording a video, turn it sideways""    ""TAKE THE PICTURE"""
312731,TJQ,2009-03-02 13:51:00,7806,Good on ya for letting it go.. what a beast!!
312927,waterwolf,2009-03-04 05:34:00,556,"great job iciing that brute ,,especially on mini 4lb test line.  a true giant !!  congrats ."
312990,BITEME,2009-03-04 13:00:00,1968,Congratulations I have to say that is definately in the top 3 of the best looking freshwater fish i have seen
313007,diggyj,2009-03-04 13:59:00,548,"Using the generic fish calculator on the OFAH website and the measurements you gave, it would have weighed about 19.5 lbs.  Great catch and an even better job on the release.  Contact the MNR regarding any records."
313071,Paully,2009-03-04 15:19:00,712,Holy Crap!
313200,tinbanger,2009-03-04 20:48:00,1028,wow!  Had no idea they were in Simcoe .  way to go guys  TB
313212,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-04 21:38:00,10439,"Kudos on letting it go, but it woulda been in my deep fryer for sure!! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Fish and Chips for dinner!!! Sweet!!!!!!!!"
313246,Muskieman,2009-03-04 22:57:00,2472,  Ostie!  Ca c'est une Loche!!!  Felicitations!!   Now that's a Ling!!!   Congratulations!!   RFS 
313289,hookerdown,2009-03-05 00:22:00,110,"Thanks Guys.  Both my brother and I didn't think the fish would be a record breaker, so we didn't even think of taking a picture with a measurement showing the length and girth.  That being said, it seems Ontario no longer keeps a C and R record book.  Who thinks a spur of the moment ice fishing trip would end up with a record fish... I have been skunked too many times to think anything like that.  As far contacting the people who know, I have emailed the OFAH and the MNR and haven't heard anything from them as of yet.  I am not expecting any miracles at this stage of the game.  But knowing that I have achieved a record, even though it is unofficial, has always been a dream of mine, and that is one thing that can't be taken from me.  Now all I need to do is catch that Tyee this summer lol.  Apparently a lot of guys would have kept the Burbot cause they're good to eat, but I got a feeling it was pretty old.  But if I have kept it, it would have be up for the offical record, and knowing that puts a damper on it a bit.  Then again, its in Simcoe somewhere ready to be caught again when its even bigger, hopefully being caught by a kid.  Hey Diggyj do you think the burbot would have weighed 19.5 since they are more eel like than most fish.  If 19.5 lbs is correct that would make it almost as heavy as my largest muskie (48"" I got 10 years ago).  Hookerdown"
313294,ozaibak1,2009-03-05 00:32:00,401,"Wow, way to go!!! I've read how Simcoe has 50+ species of fish, and the Ling did stand out for me, it just seems.. so.. cool! And you caught a beast of a Ling, that must have been exhilarating. It looks like a monster pike coming out of the hole, I really like the markings it looks amazing, and a big one at that. All I have to say is...  CONGRATULATIONS!!!   That's what it's all about for me, the THRILL."
313342,bassassin,2009-03-05 02:10:00,152,"Hey James,  I dont think we made the wrong decision. Thats a twenty year old fish that gave you a 10-15 minute fight, That big girl earned her freedom! From the video you can really tell how wide the shoulders are on that brute i believe it could have been 17lbs + . As for being recognised for catching a record, i think catching then releasing a record is alot more honorouble than keeping it just for recognitions sake. We have ther pics and video and thats all the proof we need.  This year were gonna catch some bruisers mark my words bro!!!"
313714,codered,2009-03-05 22:41:00,123,Thats a great catch .. I caught one just under 12 lb  a few years back .. they are a strange creature... Simcoe holds some bigguns .. congratttss.... I hope you get it listed  as a record ..  cheers
313724,muskeybugged,2009-03-05 23:03:00,282,"Wow, if there's ever a ling I'd want to handle that the one. Congrates  ."
314620,icedude,2009-03-07 23:19:00,459,   good on yah  nice catch dude       did the darn thing fight?  good eats--Course Fish-LS-and to think in the olde days they trashed that wonderful creature     did i hear butter?  Rice?  a beverage of your choice?  good stuff!  Paul
312445,bassassin,2009-03-01 23:33:00,152,"well my brother and I treked out to Simcoe in search of deepwater perch and maybe if were lucky a whitie. well we drove the truck out to 25' of water and setup my home made hut perhaps we shouldnt have drove out with a 2 ton truck but hey. All and all we caught about 50 perch, oh yeah and we unofficially broke the Ontario record for the largest burbot/Lingcod ever caught. Look up the record and compare. This beast  was 39"" and at least 16lbs. As you can see in the pic it hardly fit through an 8"" hole!!!! Course fish or not it was great fun and a hell of a fight on four pound testand an ultra-light rod, total battle time was about ten minutes.  8"" Hole (tight fit)        the setup we have used all season (25' of water) we should of went out on skates!!    Couple of videos of the mayhem, keep in mind I was trying to take a picture:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AlxTlUaLlA  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqINNSqb9nY"

312461,tdotfisherman,2009-03-01 23:57:00,317,What a giant! That's something to be proud of.
312463,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-01 23:59:00,3761,"A Record Catch! Thats a cool looking fish, now how do you enter the fish or get it to be the new record?  Congrads let us know if it is indeed the new record."
312467,Joey,2009-03-02 00:01:00,9122,"Wow, what a beast.   Beauty  Good for you.  Are you going to enter it for the record?  Joey"
312470,Beats,2009-03-02 00:03:00,543,"Great catch, that's huge."
312472,irishfield,2009-03-02 00:04:00,26272,I think that's the first Ling that I've seen posted from Simcoe.. and what a hog!
312480,Sinker,2009-03-02 00:12:00,8692,"That IS a HOG!!  Biggest I've seen, thats for sure. I've NEVER caught one in simcoe.......all I get are those silly whities and lakers all the time  Did you keep it??  Nice work!  Sinker"
312481,glen,2009-03-02 00:12:00,2641,They put up a good fight eh Bassassin.  I have seen some around 8lbs.   Congrats on a trophy fish.

312512,steverowbotham,2009-03-02 00:45:00,1800,nice! I've caught em up to 9 pounds.  that is a giant!
312515,profisher25,2009-03-02 00:47:00,185,This is awesome! Congrats on the catch... I wouldn't be surprised if it is an official record! Congrats again!
312535,kickingfrog,2009-03-02 01:21:00,8333,Nice Ling! Kind of a pain when they turn themselves into a question mark as your trying to get them through the hole.
312539,OhioFisherman,2009-03-02 01:29:00,6623,"Great catch! My dad used to fish for them on lake erie in the winter, I was too young to remember seeing any. He claimed they were excellent eating."
312542,BassAsin,2009-03-02 01:31:00,806,"12.72 lbs is the current ontario ling record, that looks like it may have it beat.  congrats on a beautie fish/creature for sure  Matt!"
312545,hookerdown,2009-03-02 01:39:00,110,"I'm bassassin's brother, and the guy who caught the Burbot.   I was a member a few years ago, and just signed back up today.  I'm trying to figure out the set up of the board.  In all my years of fishing I thought I would never be proud of catching a Burbot, but after catching that beast I am.  The good news is after my brother took the pics and the video, We let here go, and with some sweeps of her tail she went into the depths of Simcoe.  Unfortunately we didn't get a weight on it, but I am dying to find out more accurately the weight of the fish.  When we brought it up the 8' hole it barely fit.  The girth was about 20"".  I think for it to be an official record for starters, it has to be kept, which it wasn't.  I checked the Ontario and Lake Simcoe fish registery and there is no catagory for Burbot.  Does any one know how if or can get it be registered as a catch and release record?  Thanks  James  I just want to thank my brother for all his help with the burbot. I have been lucky enough to have my brother by my side for all of my largest fish, a 48"" muskie, 18lb Coho, 27lb Salmon, 12 lb rainbow and now the Burbot   Thanks Jay for everything."
312553,highdrifter,2009-03-02 01:49:00,2534,Wow lookit the markings on it!!  Kewl pics.  damn ugly fish though hahah
312567,kerr,2009-03-02 02:08:00,77,wicked burbot man they are the best sportfish goin. that rocked
312607,ehg,2009-03-02 02:58:00,2666,"WOW! What a huge burbot, definitely one of the biggest ever in Ontario.  When there big like that there markings really standout.  Congratulations!"
312621,richyb,2009-03-02 03:16:00,774,Hope that slimy bugger swims on over to my hut. Definitly a fish on my TO CATCH list. Congrats thats a beauty
312634,love2fishhave2work,2009-03-02 03:46:00,212,"  When you were bringing it up before you saw the head in the ice, what did you think you had.  Did you know what you had right away when it's head poped out?  I would have crapped my pants."
312639,hookerdown,2009-03-02 04:08:00,110,"Yea we knew it was a bubot, but we couldn't believe the size of it.  I always thought they might get up to 8 lbs but definately not as big as that one.  When I saw its head the first thing i did was check for teeth cause I knew the only way I could get it in was by shoving my hand down its yap."
