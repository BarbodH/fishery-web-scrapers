We (he) cleaned out the old gas, pulled the flywheel to check the points, (brand new), and changed the gearoil in the lower unit. He taught me a lot about what needed to be done. Now comes the sea trial. Should be interesting, I hope he is willing to come along for that. I promise it will be done on a sunny day not in the rain like we had today. I thank you for your help, the job was much easier with your expertise!   BTW what do I owe you, I forgot to ask."
