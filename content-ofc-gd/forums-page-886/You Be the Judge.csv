I'll mention what you said about contacting youtube.  Hopefully Dirk still has a copy.  Joey"

It seems he has deleted all his video content now.....................HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM................must have a guity conscience. Luckily I copied the links before it was too late. HEHEHE"

313647,Joey,2009-03-05 20:40:00,9122,"Okay great, thanks guys, I have forwarded this info on to them.  Joey"
313648,misfish,2009-03-05 20:42:00,29133,"Wish I had of seen the vids. I am able to down load any,you tube vid. To bad I didnt get this one."
313669,Lunker777,2009-03-05 21:20:00,866,"*note to self*  Do NOT...I repeat...DO NOT.... piss off OFC'ers ! hahah  I didnt get to see the video, But like most of you. Gaffing is not something I enjoy watching. So Ill join the cause."
313673,Terry,2009-03-05 21:24:00,14456,"if you are going to keep a fish, gaffing is fine..I guess  but gaffing fish that are clearly snagged foul hooked, that is against the law and down right nasty"
313677,GBW,2009-03-05 21:33:00,8460,The gaffing had nothing to do with it (mind you they were swining it like a kids toy wand 1/2 the time) but like Terry said SNAGGED fish.  You have to wonder how many times this group has gone out and done the same thing over and over and over...
313678,Terry,2009-03-05 21:37:00,14456,"yeah snagged and kept the fish, lots of fish gaffing just made it impossible to release even if they wanted to, but they didn't want to"

313701,GBW,2009-03-05 22:14:00,8460,"google ""CrazyCowboy69"" if you need to find him.  but be warned you will only find youtube and xxx info for that name..."
313703,misfish,2009-03-05 22:21:00,29133," Did you find the the XXX, when you typed in misfish?"
313705,GBW,2009-03-05 22:22:00,8460,never looked and now i never will!
313726,richyb,2009-03-05 23:05:00,774,"Yes its wrong to keep a snagged fish, but its not like you are trying to snag a fish in 90 feet of water. I have foul hooked a few fish this winter and released them to swim another day.. But I dont change the way I jig because of it."
314696,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-03-08 01:34:00,0,"If the mnr cant find 73 people fishing out of season on scugog theres no blinkin way theyll find simcoe laker snaggers and gaffers, your fishing licence dollars hard at work once again."
312805,GBW,2009-03-02 16:15:00,8460,hummm.... http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/ContactUs/index.html
312806,jwl,2009-03-02 16:15:00,1056,"that's brutal man, I hope the MNR got news of that for sure and they just incriminated themselves on film as evidence"
312820,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-02 16:44:00,10439,         Last year there were a bunch of guys who went to Alaska on vacation and kept illegal fish and posted it online. They were charged and convicted.
312822,Zebco,2009-03-02 16:47:00,123,He just removed em b4 I could email the MNR.  I had it all typed and went for the links to attach and they are taken down.
312823,GBW,2009-03-02 16:48:00,8460,"funny how ""This video has been removed by the user."" all of a sudden... looks like CrazyCowboy69 has removed them all and or in the process of doing it now..."
312826,brifishrgy,2009-03-02 17:06:00,559,hopefully the ministry can get the videos and charge em .. they removed them but nothing is ever gone on the net
312827,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 17:14:00,0,"the mnr might not have had time to get a copy of the vids.  whomever posted the comment that they were reporting it should not have because it gave that goober a chance to take it down.  that said, my conversation with a certain tip line last night was fun."
312829,diggyj,2009-03-02 17:17:00,548,"Just so everyone knows I emailed this guy and brought my concerns forward to him since the comments were disabled, here is his response.  ""just to let you know that i asked the mnr if a williams wobbler hits the fish in the side is it legal and they told me as long as i keep the fish which i do thats why we use the gaff so before you open your big f***** mouth get your facts right....if i could control where the lure gets the fish i would but sometimes it hits them in the side...but thanks for your concern but i really don't give a f*** and the way i fish won't change""  Just goes to show that he really doesn't care  and that he will continue to fish in these inappropriate manners. He should have his license revoked permenantly. I sure hope this individual is not a member of this fine board.  Dirk....."
312831,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 17:22:00,0,hilarious that he tried to say the mnr said it was ok (hahaha) but still took his video down. make sure you keep that message dirk...just in case it's needed as further evidence.  he further admits guilt in that message.
312833,diggyj,2009-03-02 17:24:00,548,"  I definately have it saved and if anyone knows someone at the MNR and they require a copy, please feel free to contact me.  Dirk..."
312836,steverowbotham,2009-03-02 17:26:00,1800,"i never saw the video... but to be honest, gaffing bothers me as much as anything, whether you're keeping it or not, so i'll join the hate wagon."
312837,Roy,2009-03-02 17:26:00,13728,The MNR monitors this site so they might already have a lead on it.
312838,jwl,2009-03-02 17:32:00,1056, PM sent
312851,kickingfrog,2009-03-02 17:55:00,8333, So he's stupid and a lier. What a Punk!
312857,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-02 18:09:00,10439,He may have taken them down but it's too late. They will be on backup in youtubes' backup set and then archived forever!!!!!! HAHAHA You are going down LOSER!!!!!!!! More than one person has reported you for illegally taking fish. Get out your Wallet. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
312868,diggyj,2009-03-02 18:55:00,548,"In all likelyhood I wasn't the only one that emailed him because he sent me another reply. Quite sad how un-educated this guy is. He also lies because no friend of his who is a CO of the ministyr would tell him this.  ""i took the videos down cause i'm tired of listening to d*******s like you b****,also i have a friend who is a conservation officer and i asked him and he said as long as i take the fish home to eat its ok...so i won't stop catching fish and gaffing them and taking them home to eat ...mind your own f****** business""  Clearly if he reads the act it states that..........any fish caught illegaly or out of season must be released immediatly. Including snagged fish.  I hope this guy gets nailed, no respect for the Simcoe fishery, and our natural resources.  Dirk....."
312870,Zebco,2009-03-02 18:57:00,123,Haha guy is a joke hope he gets to meet Bubba in Kingston!
312949,xeon,2009-03-04 09:47:00,350,Theres no law about posting his email address is there? Im sure a few of us would like to fill up his inbox with some hate mail... and sign him up for the latest viagra spam mailings.
313004,diggyj,2009-03-04 13:53:00,548,"I have an update for everyone. Seems he has taken the first step towards becoming a better angler and preserving out great fisheries. Here is another response he sent me from a couple of days ago.  ""ok i just off the phone with the mnr and yes i'm in the wrong i apolize for anything i said and i will change my fishing ways thank you for pointing out my bad fishing method...now i know for the future to release any fish thats foul hooked""  The damage has already been done and his image will be tarnished forever. Hopefully he is on the road to recovery by where he not only reads the regs, but he respects them.  Dirk...."
313009,e-z-out,2009-03-04 14:06:00,1052,That guy won't change one bit he just won't tape himself doing wrong this time around.
313065,blaque,2009-03-04 15:13:00,2419, My guess is he is realizing that he is going to feel the heat for this based on the exposure on the net and all the input hes recieving from anglers. And he is trying to polish himself up a litlte bit for the ensueing court proceedings
313323,skeeter,2009-03-05 01:31:00,1907,"This video has been removed by the user.   hope he was caught first never saw the video, now i wont know who's hut to run over!!! damn"
313331,Terry,2009-03-05 01:42:00,14456,"well here is the first email he sent out before the apology one and before he called the mnr  ""i don't really care because when you fish with a Williams Wobbler sometimes the lure hits the fish in the side i can't really control that but every fish gets taken home and cooked up so its not like i'm sending the fish back with injury....thanks for your concern but i don't give a damn and i won't change the way i fish because it offends you""  not the nice I did wrong kind of guy"
313635,Joey,2009-03-05 20:07:00,9122,"Well I reported this to the mnr and got a reply today.  They want to know if I have a copy of the youtube video as they captured it, but the link was broken so now they don't have it anymore.  At least they are taking steps to do something about this, so if anyone has a copy, can you let me know.  Dirk, I have PM'd you.  Joey"
313638,Terry,2009-03-05 20:18:00,14456,the way youtube is broadcast you don't get a download  but  I am sure youtube keeps a copy of every video so if you tell the mnr that    it's CrazyCowboy69 and this is the link http://www.youtube.com/browse?ytsession=_D...nw4QzmFQVl0MOas the mnr should be able to get a copy from youtube
312508,Rob,2009-03-02 00:43:00,467,SNAGGED! Man this kind of stuff irks me!  SNAGGED FISH   Rob C
312531,Terry,2009-03-02 01:17:00,14456,yup openly snagging fish on simce  hope they get caught
312534,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-02 01:20:00,0,never mind snagged fish  I was up visiting at lake scugog and I counted 73 guys fishing and the season closed yesterday feb 28th  I guess they cant read or dont care  mnr could make a fortune
312537,Terry,2009-03-02 01:25:00,14456,you have got to be kidding crazy
312540,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-02 01:30:00,0, nope  even my dad called me up and asked if you could still fish since he was seeing guys out fishing on the lake
312541,purekgw,2009-03-02 01:30:00,585,thats wrong
312543,kickingfrog,2009-03-02 01:31:00,8333,You can't fix stupid.
312544,BassAsin,2009-03-02 01:38:00,806,"its one thing to snag a fish, likely not intentional fishing for lakers, but to know its snagged then gaff it? there was absolutley no need at all to gaff that fish!  i hope the heck they get fined and hard!"
312637,xeon,2009-03-02 04:00:00,350,I like the comment though.
312640,cram,2009-03-02 04:09:00,1733,isn't that someone from this board? He looks really familiar.
312644,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-02 04:39:00,0,the only thing about the comment is that it might have given this gentleman enough heads up to take down his video.
312648,GBW,2009-03-02 04:55:00,8460,"Did you watch the other vid's by this ""person""?!?!?!  look at IceFishin2009 #2 and it seams to be that ALL fish were SNAGGED!!!  Every video I have see so far are of SNAGGED fish!  I hope the MNR get these guys..."
312651,Zubris21,2009-03-02 05:10:00,563,"Only watch the one that was posted, but there ought to be some repercussions, someone should drop of a copy of the regs at their hut sometime."
312661,Stoty,2009-03-02 06:08:00,2910,"Big, ugly and stupid....  And, they need to take their skirts off, and GRAB a trout. Last time I checked, I dont think they are what you would classify as a danger to handle!  I still cant get over the fact they snagged, gaffed those fish...and were DUMB enough to put that online!  I think their parents are related!"
312715,Greencoachdog,2009-03-02 13:30:00,8163,Not the brightest candles on the Birthday cake eh?
312745,e-z-out,2009-03-02 14:18:00,1052,5 videos and only 1 fish was caught the right way but was still gaffed. we all know what they look like now so if you see them on the ice and you have an extra copy of the regs on you be a nice guy and hand them a copy.  Stupid people need help on and off the ice
312760,Maverick,2009-03-02 14:38:00,371,"Dumb and dumber!  I can see the odd fish being snagged when the fish goes for the bait and then turns and your lure hooks him in the side but when all of them are snagged, you're trying to snag them."
312761,Joey,2009-03-02 14:38:00,9122,Yesterday someone made a comment under the video on Youtube about it and now today I see the comment is gone and no comments are allowed anymore  So they obviously know and don't care.  Hope they get theirs!  Joey
312762,Zebco,2009-03-02 14:40:00,123,"I just watched his other video, its called 2009#3 and that fish was hooked in the tail, that 2 outta 2 video's the fish was snagged.  I'm gonna go watch the rest.  He took your comments down,but left the video up I sure hope he gets what he deserves     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykz7Fychz9c&NR=1  Very end of the vid look where his lure is.  Has anyone called the authorities?  Maybe we should all email them this any links to someone that would care?"
312770,e-z-out,2009-03-02 15:11:00,1052,just flag the videos and they will all come down.
312771,steelheader42,2009-03-02 15:13:00,44,That just makes me sick knowing its snagged and keeping it and video taping themselfs.....not to bright!
312775,charlesn,2009-03-02 15:21:00,551,"I recall a few months (maybe years) back someone taped themselves doing something similar - like maybe grabbing trout out of a stream with their hands or something, and it got on the local news and they got charged with fish and game violations or something like that.  I'm sorta like braided line in that I have very little memory, so I could be confused...  again.  I would think that these videos in the hands of authorities would lead to charges and a conviction.  Charles"
312792,highdrifter,2009-03-02 15:55:00,2534,"Panzies.  Somebody outta gaff them for a change.  Don't worry maaann, everytings gonna be iray ya know?  They must think they're sooo funny!!  I really hope they see this uproar they've created..  Betcha they won't be laughing then.  Let's git em!  HD"
