Rubber boots and cleats made the walk easy and dry. First spot: 95 feet, marked many fish, some interested, but no takers. Walk out a bit to 110 feet, one fish marked. Walk back in a ways, 100 feet, marked lots of fish, still no takers. It started to rain at about 1:40pm and after about 30 minutes of that I figured I'd go home and maybe score enough points that I can go back out on Sunday for half a day.  18 inches of solid ice , but it was movin' around a bit. I guess we'll see what this rain does, maybe it's time to break-out the long rods and waders."

314590,irishfield,2009-03-07 22:28:00,26272,Started raining 1:40? Glad I didn't fly down to meet Lloyd. They were on the whities at 8am ... Just started raining here about an hour ago.
314617,Joey,2009-03-07 23:13:00,9122,"The ice is moving around a bit, lovely  Thanks for the update.  Sorry they didn't cooperate for you.  Joey"
314842,snag,2009-03-08 16:57:00,1932,"Yeah,  This week might make a big dent on the ice.  Get the rod and waders out!"
314867,ozaibak1,2009-03-08 18:08:00,401,"Yeah I was out for perch on Saturday too, soon as the rain hit everything shut down... bummer. Is that always the case on the ice? Usually I associate rain with increased action..."
314875,Cookslav,2009-03-08 18:25:00,1457,"yup.....above zero with rain, and up to 12 degrees by Wednesday smaller lakes are comming apart quickly. I was at belwood lake Friday with a good 16-18"" of ice but the shore was more like 4"" with open spots, by yesterday the shore was open 15-20'...only way on or off was by boat. Today she was open 30' in spots and the ice out deep looked really sketchy. I think some smaller lakes will be done for the season by mid week.  Oh well bring on spring!"
