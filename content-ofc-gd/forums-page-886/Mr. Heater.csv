314335,Fisherpete,2009-03-07 05:37:00,1814,"Anyone else frustrated with theirs? I find mine constantly going out, every bump or slight breeze in the portable seems to make it go out. I had a Coleman one before, I think it was called the sportcat, which was much better at staying lit - but also at melting jacket sleeves LOL! The Mr. Heater does pump out a lot of heat... WHEN IT STAYS ON! Anyone have any tips on fixing this or on modifying/improving the heater?"
314359,Cudz,2009-03-07 12:01:00,2652,I have a double burner Mr. Heater and it has never gone out.  How old is it?  If it is not too old I would take it back.
314376,LeXXington,2009-03-07 13:07:00,1928,You have a dirty intake (see MR buddy trouble shooting)  Take compressed air and clear it all out./ That should fix your issue
314401,Terry,2009-03-07 13:58:00,14456,"I would think you have a bit of dirt, LeXXington seems to have the answer   some people also screw on a little wind deflector in front of the pilot light  to stop wind from blowing it out"
314411,limeyangler,2009-03-07 14:20:00,5204,"i have the Mr. Heater Big Buddy, it has been really good. It does cut out if i move it too quickly but i rarely have to move it. I did manage to break the screws off on the right hand side cover( the heater takes a bit of a beating in the back of my shelter/sleigh) but customer service was excellent, sent me a replacement part , no questions asked on warranty, even waived shipping charges on the 20lb tank hose with filter that i ordered at the same time.  if you get no joy with the dirty intake fix suggested above...give 'em a call, they were very helpful and quick to help out."
314472,steverowbotham,2009-03-07 16:39:00,1800,"mine blows out when the wind gets on her, but with such an easy pilot light, i raely get frustrated, i'f flicking a switch twice is the worst part of my day, i'm having a good day"
314599,ld17,2009-03-07 22:51:00,319,Here is the fix.  Don't know if it works.  Never tried it.  Good luck.  http://www.chitown-angler.com/1fish/viewtopic.php?t=36910
314705,Fisherpete,2009-03-08 02:09:00,1814,"Great, thanks guys. I'll try the fix and post the results later."
314735,wallyboss,2009-03-08 03:41:00,1095,That fix will stop the wind from blowing it out. But the shutting off if you move it well that is just for the safety.
314869,Tybo,2009-03-08 18:10:00,1373,When using bulk tanks or refilling one pounds. You should use a filter or regulator This will solve most of the problems you having.
314986,Fisherpete,2009-03-09 00:18:00,1814,I only use new 1lb tanks... I am going to try the compressed air trick tonight. Heading out tomorrow so I will test the results.
