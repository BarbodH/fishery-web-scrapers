5629,Joey,2006-11-27 18:55:00,9122,"Well I wasn't going to do a report as we made out about the same as everyone else at the Upper Niagara G2G - El Skunko!!!  But since people are wondering, here is what our day was like.  We awoke at 4 a.m. and got ready and were out the door just before 5 a.m.  We drove through fog so thick we couldn't even tell we were on the Burlington Skyway.  We finally figured out we were by the RPM's in the truck  We went over another high bridge and I took this shot, it was starting to dissipate by this time.    As we hit St. Catharines it was like a light switch turned the fog off and it was a clear beautiful day.  We got to the launch around 7:30 (after finding a gas station to fill the boat, but that's another story) and what a beautiful day it was.  The water was like glass and very clear.    We missed Lew and Squid and everybody else at the launch but found them out on the water.  Lew & Squid    Rizzo (Roger)    We trolled every colour and type of musky lure we had, even Roy's homemade jake type lures, and those girls were just not in a cooperative mood    We finally got off the water about 3:30 or 4:00 p.m. and Lew and Squid were just heading back out again.  We needed to get our land legs back and then it strarted to get dark so we decided to just meet everyone at The Lazy Lizard.  We met a few people from the Niagara message board there and chatted and then Lew and Squid came and we sat down for a few chicken wings.  Paul looks like he's telling another yarn about the one that got away    We must have missed Uncle Buck and Fang somewhere along the line, but maybe next time we'll meet up.  All in all it was a beauty day to be on the water and its the first time we were on the Upper so it was a good day to learn depths etc. for the next time should the weather not be so cooperative.  Paul and I had a great time chatting with you Lew and Peter.  Maybe next time we'll get those girls eh!!  Cheers.  Joey"
5631,misfish,2006-11-27 18:59:00,29133,Thanks J for sharing.  Lew looks very depressed.  Paul has the italian hands waving there.  I take it that is squid?
5639,setomonkey,2006-11-27 19:22:00,872,"Too bad about the skunk but it looked like another beautiful day to be out on the water.  Yeah, the fog was really something in the am, I had something in St. Catharines and was going through the same thing, lots of 'pea soup' and then suddenly bright blue skies...  Mike"
5640,douG,2006-11-27 19:23:00,2693,"That be Squid, alright.  Thanks for your report, Joanne."
5642,Terry,2006-11-27 19:26:00,14456,"and the good news is...no one looks cold  and here I was ready to make 50"" bucks for everyone that got a big one..maybe next time"
5644,Whopper,2006-11-27 19:33:00,2174,Good report Joey. The first two pics are cool. I took a skunking myself on saturday but it was great to be out.  Whopper
5645,ccmtcanada,2006-11-27 19:33:00,7971,"Thanks for posting....even if the fishing wasn't good, I liked seeing fellow OFC'ers enjoying themselves on the water and indoors as well!  Great report joey....next time you'll get 'em....I'm just sure of it!"
5685,irishfield,2006-11-27 21:18:00,26272,Thanks for the report Joey.
5714,PatB,2006-11-27 22:52:00,104,"Nice to see the report, the skyway bridge pic looks great."
5715,Dondorfish,2006-11-27 22:53:00,1000,"Joey - in the first picture you are going over the ""Garden City Skyway "" - thou I think it has a new name now. The water below is the Welland Canal.  Sorry to hear you guys didn't fair to well but at least it was a great day to be out on the water. I was gonna try to go to the G2G, being from St. Catharines, but the walleyes in Quinte were calling out to me.    Great post and nice pictures   Don"
5719,JFR,2006-11-27 23:01:00,498,"Joey, thanks for sharing.....one of these years, I'm going to have hit the upper with other OFNers, instead of fishing GBay  John"
5796,Rizzo,2006-11-28 02:00:00,4754,"thanks for the picks Joey/Tybo.  What was it you were yelling to me as you guys trolled past??  We fished everywhere from the roundhouse down to Netherby Rd casting, trolling, jigging and didn't have a sniff all day.  Water was around 47 degrees.  I fished the upper the week before as well, got skunked then too, water was also 47 degrees.  Man I hate 47.  Unfortunately I couldn't stick around for the swill, but it was nice seeing a few people again"
5824,Joey,2006-11-28 03:21:00,9122,"Roger, I was yelling to ask you what time the swill was to begin.  I couldn't remember if it was 5:30 or 7:30.  What are ya deaf  Cheers.  Joey"
5827,snag,2006-11-28 03:25:00,1932,"Hey Joey,  Skunking builds character! Think of it as more training.  Cheers!"
5838,Joey,2006-11-28 04:10:00,9122,"Well Snag, many more days like that and I'm gonna dye my hair with a white streak right down the middle"
