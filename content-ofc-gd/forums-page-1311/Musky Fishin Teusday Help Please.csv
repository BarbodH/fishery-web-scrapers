5699,mepps,2006-11-27 22:27:00,1301,what lake you heading to?
5702,irishfield,2006-11-27 22:31:00,26272,Hopefully he can see the lake....sure can't go out on Gbay. I've been to town three times today and still haven't been able to see water for the fog. Suspect it's gonna be that way right 'till Friday when the cold and snow hits.

5745,tomO,2006-11-28 00:20:00,363,I'm in Ohio! LOL. The last trip of the year for muscky probably. I figure they will be in deeper water but I'm not sure. I've never fished this late for them.
5746,silveradosheriff,2006-11-28 00:21:00,1025,I would guess in the water.  :-)
5752,Crazyhook,2006-11-28 00:28:00,1154,got into a few last Friday... water temp was 38!  the key to get the fish to bite was a very SLOW presentation... try deep diving jerk / glide baits or minnows baits... most the fish we moved were around rocks
5761,tomO,2006-11-28 00:55:00,363,"ok thx crazy hook. Silveradosherriff thats where I've been messin up, (mental note ,fish the wet stuff not the dry) got it."
5778,Whopper,2006-11-28 01:31:00,2174,"mudbutt the best advice that I can give you is go pick up the winter issue of Esox Angler. I just got mine in the mail today and it's got a ton of info. I'm just like a little kid when it come to books I got to look at the pictures first, I really think that they need to rename this issue to ""Monsters Of The Midway""  Whopper"
5901,OhioFisherman,2006-11-28 13:57:00,6623,"Probably to late to help, try the first drop from shore. My buddies have been scoring well on bass in 4 to 8 feet of water, they are feeding heavy on baitfish. The Mskies might be to or feeding on the bass. Piedmont?"
6190,tomO,2006-11-29 00:09:00,363,Well we fished all day and and beautiful day it was but no big fish ended up catching a few crappie while we were jiggin for wally's. They were down about 30 ft. Ohiofisherman we were going to hit piedmont but ended up  at saltfork. We thought there might be to many slugs flyin around at piedmont.
