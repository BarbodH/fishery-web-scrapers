5518,Fish Farmer,2006-11-27 14:23:00,2234,"Just got back from Quinte. Great weather and fishing. 6 guys. The last day, 1 guy had to go home so we fished in my boat 5 guys, what a hoot  . at times we had 8 lines out, all off plainers and flat lines. Last count was 28 fish. 3 to 12 lbs. bait was Stretch 20, Tail Dancers, Reef Runners, in different colours. I wish you all could have as good as weather we had, we'll never have weather like that agian in Nov.. 3 days in a row. A few pictures to share This is the Gang                                       And of course, my mug shot "
