5577,mpt,2006-11-27 17:18:00,158,"Lungelarry, That's a beautiful fish. Where did you get it? Is it over 100lbs?. I got mine in Truman Res. it was only 40lbs a lot smaller than yours."
5608,Bly,2006-11-27 18:21:00,1556,"Hmm so many many choices to choose from.....being realistic, I would love to target and of course land northern, salmon and IF I manage that.....MUSKY!!!  Another dream (saltwater) is to go fishing with my big bro for some striper and maybe the gods will smile on me and I could fight with a shark for a bit  blyght"
5641,Weeds,2006-11-27 19:26:00,782,"Having just moved up to (still in the process really) Peterborough I'm really looking forward to some Walleye through the ice North of the city a ways and some fat Perch over in Simcoe. I really want to catch a decent size Pike too so I'm hoping to get one somewhere along the Toronto harbourfront before the snow starts to fly. Come spring I can't wait to have a go at those giant Kawartha Carp and of course, once the season opens..Musky!! Never caught one but I'm a stones throw away from the Otonabee so I figure this is gonna be my year! Stoked! Oh yeah, I've always wanted to catch a whopper of a catfish too but that might have to wait for some kinda roadtrip....."
5701,Lungelarry,2006-11-27 22:30:00,294,"Hey Madhuskie, thats not me. I found that pic on a Miss. website. Its the state record."
3950,wuchikubo,2006-11-22 20:00:00,1114,I was just wondering if others out there plan to target other freshwater species that they have never caught before?  Top five?  Maybe someone could help me with some pointers so I can hook up with the following species: (no particular order for me)  1: Ling (thinking simcoe) 2: Brookies (sadly I have not had a real chance to target them) 3: Sturgeon (just for the sight of having one on the line) 4: Greyling (beautiful fish in the pictures) 5: Muskie (how could I have forgotten this monster!)
3954,Crazyhook,2006-11-22 20:11:00,1154,Peacock bass Ouananiche ( Landlock salmon)  then in saltwater hope to cross swordfish and sailfish on my list this December!
3955,jordan,2006-11-22 20:12:00,136,I want to target all of those fish but dont have any ideas mabe when iam older and have more time dam school. those are the fish i want to go after  1.

3959,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-22 20:19:00,2050,My first Steelie!
3960,Moosebunk,2006-11-22 20:19:00,3970,"Luckily sturgeon, sockeye, chinooks, pinks, cohos, bows, dolly varden, cutthroat, sailfish, marlin, mahi mahi, wahoo, roosterfish, grouper, yellowfin, bonitos, permit, jacks, mackerel, needlefish, lake trout and maybe even a brown trout all are possible in the coming year.  The usual pike and eyes are a good bet as well.  What I really want is a brookie over 5 lbs and an arctic char.  Wouldn't say no to a first muskie though."
3961,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 20:22:00,7971,All I've caught have been Walleye and some very small panfish since I started again this past August.  I'd like to catch the following next year....  Salmon Trout  Maybe try my hat at bass fishing as well.  I've got lots to learn first though!!
3962,kemper,2006-11-22 20:22:00,2232,"Lake trout in a river is a big one for me Coho salmon, ive only ever caught one arctic char brookies (only fished them a few times, beautiful fish) MORE STEEL (in a drought lately) grayling"
3967,wuchikubo,2006-11-22 20:46:00,1114," Moosebunk, isn't that a muskie in your avatar?  Man, all those kinds available to be caught in your neck of the woods? Now I feel I live in the wrong place."
3968,Rich,2006-11-22 20:48:00,3927,Sturgeon & Lake Trout for sure
3993,setomonkey,2006-11-22 21:21:00,872,"Muskie, grayling, lake trout, peacock bass...  mike"
4005,Squid,2006-11-22 21:53:00,1656,"Muskies, what else can I say, everything else is food for the toothy critters"

4035,Jigger,2006-11-22 23:03:00,1237,I'd like to get into some good garpike. Sturgeon looks like an awesome time!
4052,fishindevil,2006-11-22 23:39:00,6254,"i want to get a real big sturgeon,i fish the ottawa river alot and have caught 1 sturgeon it was about 25lbs,i got her while fishing for walleye i was using a homemade lindy rig,fishing in the rapidsshe put up a real good fight with being in the fast water and all,i released her ,and got a few pics...so i want to target them ,they get real big in the ottawa river so in 07 when the season opens i will try for a big one,as well im going to try for a real big channel cat,they have caught them up to 35lbs in the river as well,will target them too,we normally will catch a dozen or so every year but they seem to always be the same size,between 5-10lbs so it would be nice to get a 20 or so......"
4063,Mike the Pike,2006-11-23 00:02:00,3421,I am waiting for an invite to the BOQ from Percher and Biteme.Need another Walleye fix.
4074,outdoorguy61,2006-11-23 00:31:00,220,Artic grayling Arctic Char Landlocked salmon would be interesting  * I believe that I will be able to catch at least one of these this year.  outdoorguy61
4077,Mike the Pike,2006-11-23 00:36:00,3421,Hey outdoor guy where do you catch Land locked Salmon in Ontario.I have only ever tried once in Quebec on Lake Mempremagog right after ice out.Mike

4212,fishdawg,2006-11-23 07:05:00,912,"ive hardly evercaught any brookies - one wild, & few from a stocked pond - never caught a splake - would like to get some through the ice sometime, but will require some travell - never caught a sauger - not sure where in Ont to look for them - Skamania (summer run great lakes rainbow) - ive herd they fight like hell! - atlantic salmon - i may have caught one before in Lake O, but most likely was a brown ( didnt take a photo) - arctic char one day (fingers crossed) - a sturgeon would be neat"
