5948,Sherriff,2006-11-28 15:51:00,252,Anyone here do California Knock-Down ceilings?  I am looking at getting my basement ceiling finished.  Right now it is just painted with a smooth finish...  Let me know.  Sherriff

The idea is to shoot globs of material onto the surface, wait until just the right drying time (varies, 5 to 25 minutes) and lightly smooth the globs with a large flat blade of some sort. I use an eighteen-inch drywall knife. In a pinch I have used a clean spray shield with good results (Texture pros would probably run me off for that).  The hopper is good for the small pea size stuff to the about nickel size texture. If the texture on your ceiling is about the size of a quarter or larger, you may want to rent a small texture sprayer so you can shoot some bigger globs.  I use the ceiling and wall texture powder available at home depot in the drywall section. Works great for me. Read the directions, the hopper directions will probably have more detailed instructions on doing the knockdown."

6040,douG,2006-11-28 19:08:00,2693,"Do a little googling, Sherriff.  You will be able to find lots of information.  Practice on a sheet of masonite first to get the timing right for the consistency of mud you are using. Good Luck!"
