5462,Chris Cross,2006-11-27 11:52:00,46,"Pockets and I launched the old coleman canoe from Tiffin ramp and fished most of the day. About dozen boat all around one spot. The perch were hungry. We used minnows, it was nonstop all day. We got 8 jumbos for the fry pan. The fishing from shore looked slow, but from 200' off shore if was good. The perch seemed to be just off bottom. About 2:00 the perch seemed to move up amd we got loads from about 6-8' down. Than by 5;00 they were on bottom again. Lots of boats came and left, eveyone seemed to be catchin. If weather is good we'll try again next weekend. CX"
