5450,Darrell,2006-11-27 05:06:00,27,"Well on Thursday I was asked by Aaron, if I would like to join him and take a contest winner from the ""Getting Hooked"" site for a day out on the Niagara since Barry was unable to make it. So upon thinking do I work on the  show all Saturday or do I go fishing, the choice was pretty clear. So after we what seemed a longer than useual drive to Niagara cause of the fog, we met the contest winner who goes by the nickname ""HOSS""at the Queenston ramp. As soon as we left the dock we headed to the American side to see what we could get into and what led into a most memorable day for us all especially ""HOSS"". Bouncing 3 ways with roe was the ticket, I was lucky enough to hit a Niagara triple crown ""Laker,Brown and Bow"", ""HOSS"" managed about 6 fish with his personal best Steelhead to date. But thats were everything ended for us and Aaron got the hot hand of the day with boating around 20 bows and Hoss and I played netboy LOL, and sometimes telling Aaron to net his own fish LOL. All in all was a great day on the water, and getting to fish with a contest winner that is as passionate for steelhead as Aaron and myself was a treat. Darrell www.gettinghooked.net  Aaron with his first of many bows   Contest winner ""HOSS"" with his first bow of the day   Myself with a nicely coloured up brown   And Aaron with another of many LOL "
5463,xrap,2006-11-27 11:57:00,683,Very nice fish
5465,Roy,2006-11-27 12:15:00,13728,Fantastic! It's amazing isn't it? People pay big bucks to fish far when such great fishing is available reasonably close to home. Way to go guys. Thanks for posting.
5466,Blake,2006-11-27 12:17:00,418,Great report.  Nice to see those beauties from the river.

5475,ccmtcanada,2006-11-27 12:36:00,7971,"Awesome report and fish!  Looked like a GREAT day weather wise too.  It's great to see so many great reports this late in the year, considering October was such a cold and rainy mess!"
5484,bpsbassman,2006-11-27 12:50:00,941,"Great report Darrell, Looks like HOSS had a great day fishwise and the bonus would be to out on the water with a ""CLASS"" individual like Aaron (and yourself too of course)."

5620,Seahag,2006-11-27 18:36:00,19,in one of the pic's looks like you were on the american side.  I've heard but is the fishign better on the US side of queenston.  nice fish.  wish i could have done that when i went a few weeks ago.
5632,Joey,2006-11-27 19:05:00,9122,Great report and beauty fish.  Maybe we should have tried the lower last weekend instead  Good stuff.  Joey
5637,wuchikubo,2006-11-27 19:17:00,1114,"WTG on the outing, great beautiful pics of those fish!"
5662,Darrell,2006-11-27 20:08:00,27,"Hey Seahag its hard to say which side is better, you just have to be where the fish want to be. From what I understand when the water is warmer ""mid 40's"" the fish like the faster current which turns out to be the American side."
5664,jordan,2006-11-27 20:19:00,136,Nice fish guys W2G and the weather not a cloud in the sky.   jordan
5667,Mike Pike,2006-11-27 20:26:00,1332,"Nice job pinch-hitting there Darrell!  Those are some beautiful fish, to be sure.  I'll be the contest winner ""Hoss"" was a happy fellow.  Did I say those were beautiful fish!???"
