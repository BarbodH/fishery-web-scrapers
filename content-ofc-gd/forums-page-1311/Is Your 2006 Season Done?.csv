5886,jediangler,2006-11-28 13:20:00,1923,"Took the kayak out to Puslinch for one last spin on Sunday. Didn't have any luck, but did see two guys in a canoe catching pike on live minnows. Once the temps fall below 10C, I'm finished. Ice is for playing hockey on and keeping your drinks cold. Looking forward to the spring and all the fish that'll bring"
5888,tinbanger,2006-11-28 13:25:00,1028,Turns out saturday pearhing was the last trip with the boat. Was hoping for thursday Muskie but weather and work screwed that up  Dropping the boat off at the dealer on friday for some warranty work then into storage till March.  Tinbanger
5890,Squid,2006-11-28 13:31:00,1656,Fishing the lower queenston-bar all winter for bows and lakers
5891,Raf,2006-11-28 13:32:00,3495,It never ends.
5907,fishindevil,2006-11-28 14:12:00,6254,"im still going as well until the lakes freeze,then its hardwater time,so it never ends,when one season ends another season starts,thats only bass fisherman that quit when the weather gets cold.......us die-hard walleye guys NEVER QUIT....."
5915,ecmilley,2006-11-28 14:37:00,2163,"didn't realize that fishing season ever ended just moves locations, now I just have to free some time up to get out there"
5917,Smokey,2006-11-28 14:40:00,1278,My soft water season will be ending this week as I'm going to winterize the boat before the weekend. But bring on the hard water season. I have the portable hut out of storage and slowly getting it ready to go.  Mike
5919,Headhunter,2006-11-28 14:43:00,5703,"Lookin forward to a few more trips to BoQ in the coming weeks and hoping the ice holds off there until january! Let the snow fly, the freezing rain, what ever, as long as the ""Q"" dosen't freeze! It's only now, beginning to get ""good""! HH"
5921,LeXXington,2006-11-28 14:57:00,1928,Sadly yes.. Put my baby for the short sleep last weekend.  December is just too busy and by the time I am free the ice is about 5 inches thick
5950,Beans,2006-11-28 15:52:00,3339,"Yep...I'm probaly done for 2006.  Maribeth and I pulled the ""Tin"" out on the 10th of November and except for buying a box of mothballs to scatter in her to keep the critters away, she's done for the winter.  But then again, the first time I met Big Cliff live and in person was on the 28th of December for some first-ice fishing up at Couchiching several years ago so you never know... "
5988,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-28 17:29:00,2050,not until I land my first steelie! - man the last week of decembers gonna be a rough one! haha  good fishin!
6109,Craig,2006-11-28 20:52:00,33,Winterized the boat when deer seasoned opened.  Now to wait till April....thank goodness for WFN!
6142,Ron,2006-11-28 22:09:00,1683,"Not yet, still lots o fish to be had out there."
6188,Garyv,2006-11-29 00:06:00,547,unless there is fisable ice before 12/31/06 yes I am done for the season.
5770,Crazyhook,2006-11-28 01:18:00,1154,getting colder and people are putting boats away and losening drags.... who is still fishing?  I am hoping to get out for musky at least once more and may get down to the BOQ for some fall fatties  then off to Florida!
5777,irishfield,2006-11-28 01:30:00,26272,Possibly Thursday on the Bay for muskie...but I doubt we'll be able to get out if todays never lifting fog is any indication of the weeks weather. I'm not holding my breath that we'll make it out.  Also...read you insurance policies guys. Many will find you have a layup period starting December 1st.
5781,Carp,2006-11-28 01:33:00,1488,"Ready to rumble. Boat is stored in the garage, so tarps, etc. are not an issue.  I'm hoping to get down to Quinte once more before ice up. Maybe this Sunday.  I've fished walleye on Georgian Bay in December on days when we had a hard time getting out to the fishing spots because of the thickness of the ice near shore.  Ya, I'm a little crazy."
5787,Guest gbfisher,2006-11-28 01:42:00,0,My wife will tell you it NEVER ENDS.   2006 ends and 2007 starts. Never ending circle.  
5790,Whopper,2006-11-28 01:43:00,2174,"Boat was winterized, clean and put up yesterday but I'm not done fishing. Been honing in on some saugeyes at a local river  Whopper"
5793,Rich,2006-11-28 01:56:00,3927,Been out everyday for at least an hour since mid October. Don't plan to stop.
5794,Mike Pike,2006-11-28 01:57:00,1332,"As long as the rivers and habours don't freeze, there's still fishing to be had.  Then, of course, there's the Christmas week( just before the year ends )where Simcoe freezes over in Keswick and ice fishing begins.  Maybe the drags of some reels are loosened, but not ALL of them!  I don't let a any month go by in the year without fishing.  Good fishin' all!!"
5795,Rich Clemens,2006-11-28 01:59:00,3131,All in and all done until next year.  Gonna be a looooong winter.
5800,dsn,2006-11-28 02:09:00,1018,I'm going steelheading now. LOL  Went twice so far... and got skunked twice!! I'm loving it!!
5802,Rizzo,2006-11-28 02:10:00,4754,"yup, put the boat away after being skunked 3 week-ends in a row on the upper niagara.  Seen enough, gonna wait it out until the ice forms"
5807,charlied,2006-11-28 02:22:00,584,Well I will only stop if the Niagara freezes....which it don't so  I say bring on the fishing....I go all winter long!
5812,nautifish,2006-11-28 02:29:00,1416,"Well was out on the boat for most part of yesterday....Was debateing on putting her away for the winter then i changed my mind.....lol....I plan on fishing right through rain ,sun,snow or shine."
5813,FishFinder,2006-11-28 02:35:00,481,Steelheading is just starting
5818,kemper,2006-11-28 02:56:00,2232,"Fishing season, ending? Never!  I dont have a boat, so no worries there.  Ill be the guy walking along the creek in january looking for an open pool to fish some steelhead, and making a hole if I cant find one!"
5819,camillj,2006-11-28 02:56:00,1988,  I agree 100% ... its only a matter of where how and for what .... the concept of 'whether' doesnt enter into the conversation
5822,setomonkey,2006-11-28 03:09:00,872,"I think I'm done, though I might try to hit a trib for steelhead once or twice. Haven't been motivated to fish rivers this year, had very little luck last year and feel like I'm stuck...  Mike"
5840,snag,2006-11-28 04:26:00,1932,Put the rod and reel away?   FROM.....MY.....STIFF....COLD....FINGERS......   Chareton Heston announces: Ice-fishing season!
5841,Joey,2006-11-28 04:29:00,9122,"Nope, this is our favorite time of year.  We'll fish til the iceburgs bang the side of the boat  Probably do another Quinte trip and a lower Niagara or two  Joey"

5855,JFR,2006-11-28 10:44:00,498,"My boat is away, Tiny's boat is still in my driveway, planning at least one or two more outings on GBay, weather permitting  . Possibility of Wednesday, temps to be 17, with 40% for showers.  John"

5860,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-11-28 11:20:00,0,"I have to guide all of next week, then it's my time to fish. I hope I can get out and fish quite a few more days before the water gets hard."
5864,smellin fishy,2006-11-28 11:39:00,21,I'm gonna go and try and hunt down some skis this morrnin.
5876,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-28 12:41:00,0,Boat's away but have been hitting a nearby trib and the islands until ice season starts.  Hope all is well CH   !!  How's the donut business these days ??
5880,madtekniques,2006-11-28 12:53:00,15,My 2006 lake season has come to an end but there's still plenty of fishing to take place in the rivers!
