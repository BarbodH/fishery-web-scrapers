6079,Craig,2006-11-28 20:25:00,33,"Hey everyone.  I was Craig on the last board with around 200 posts, so when I re-upped I thought I'd pick something a little more fun and suiting of my personality!  I'm originally from the Soo and currently live in London (possiblity presenting itself to move back however) and usually fish Wawa, the Soo and Manitoulin areas.  Got my first deer last week on the Manitoulin, very proud of myself.  Just thought I'd say hi all over again and I must say, I like the new format!"
