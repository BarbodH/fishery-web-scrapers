5458,Moosebunk,2006-11-27 06:39:00,3970,If anyone sees them again remember to hurt their feelings. lol.
5474,big guy,2006-11-27 12:35:00,414,"I have read most, but not all the replies to this thread, but I am curious about one thing.  Did anyone actually send the photo and boat numbers to the MNR to see what could actually be done about the situation, if anything?"
5563,Headhunter,2006-11-27 16:28:00,5703,"Speeding on a highway, does NOT kill the highway...potentially only the speeding car and or other drivers. That's why we have laws... I think the comparison speaks for it's self! HH"
5605,bigfish1965,2006-11-27 18:09:00,3382," Do you equate speeding with resource infractions? Do you equate speeding with arson or child molestation? To try and justify resource violations with 'well you guys speed so you are the same' is without logic or merit. It is not the same. This is why we set different penalties for different infractions. Trying to justify poaching by saying everyone else speeds in their car is like saying its okay for me to rob someone at gunpoint cause lots of people fudge their tax returns. And yes, if I speed and get a ticket, that's my fault...no one elses. I have sped in my car. I do not poach. Using a fallacious 'tu quoque' argument doesn't diminish the violation of the original pictured persons. It is generally considered a display of capitulation when one resorts to erroneous logic.  The MNR visits daily, I can assure you. Yes, notifications were sent to a few different people as well."
5875,Chris,2006-11-28 12:27:00,405," Rick do you equate resource infraction with child molestation and arson??? Sure sounds that way. Not going to comment on the multiple rod issue.....you guys have beaten it to death already. What appalls me is the disregard some have shown towards the LAWS of the road.   I live on a curve and every single year there are at least two vehicles that end up on my front lawn. One year we had a car hit a tree in our front yard and less than a month later, one hit the telephone pole. And the only reason.....the ONLY reason....is speeding. Idiots don't know enough to slow down. I have a wife and child that use the roads on a daily basis and it pisses me off that some idiots think saving two minutes of their own time is more important than the lives of others using the same roadways. Using the same quote Rick used earlier but with a little twist, ""driving is not a right, it's a privelage""!!! Hope all you speeders get the book thrown at you. Geez you'd almost think that some people put the lives of a few fish ahead of the lives of human beings."
5906,Marc Thorpe,2006-11-28 14:11:00,621,"Chris,BigFish is not comparing those infractions,he simple stating those that do are off the mark  Interesting info and discussion  Bottom line is we should  practice sportfishing with the long term in mind if we consider future generations and what the sport itself means to society"
6195,cisco,2006-11-29 00:15:00,597,"See thread Quinte Warning"" Don't get caught breaking the law! Just got back and anyone going needs to read this!"
5253,danc,2006-11-26 14:17:00,4677,This thread has been pinned for several days now and many good points have been made. It's obviously an important subject to all of us. It has served it's purpose and I think its time to let it run its course in the general discussion forum. Replies are still welcome.
5261,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-11-26 14:35:00,0,"Those idiots should be crucified. They are not only poaching by using extra rods but they have 4 times their legal amount.  That's like going 4 times the speed limit if you want to compare it that way.  As for guides doing it for the money, come on we're at the bottom of pay scale. Barely make enough to help pay a few bills around the house. Most of us are doing it for the love of fishing and nothing more. Some of us are also giving back a heck of a lot to the fisheries. So it's a very few that are raping the fisheries for their personal gain like in every other business out there.  Now let's say these idiots come across a feeding school of muskies, anyone fishing St-Clair knows that they feed in bunches on most days out there, and all 8 rods  ( maybe 6 or 4 but anything over 2 isn't good ) go off all at once. How many of those fish are they going to kill? The same can happen when they'll be running two rods next year, how does a guy fishing alone handle a double header?  I still don't understand why anyone would need to double the number of rods on a lake that puts out more muskies then anywhere else. Are they looking at getting 20 muskies a day instead of 10?  BTW for those that don't fish St-Clair, most guys out there are already running 2 lures per rod ( the legal amount of hooks is 4 per line ), so next year they will be running 4 lures per angler legally.  I just don't get it.  P.S. What makes you think that anyone using an extra amount of rods or poaching are going to be respecting their limits. I see this with the walleye guys out here, they never seem to be putting anything back and some even come out multiple times per day, maybe it's for multiple limits. I would be interested in seeing their freezers."
5272,fishergirl72,2006-11-26 15:23:00,455,"I just had to reply to this.....that is a dang shame, and it gets me hot under the collar!"
4787,robin,2006-11-24 20:47:00,46,"Who Cares ????? I care!!!! Come on give me a brake Indians MRN what are you guys smoking They are 2 idiots out fishing breaking the law!!! They have no disregaurd for the law Today there using to many poles tommorrow there keeping over there limit and so on. Gavin I really expected much more out of you, If you truly dont care how many rods they are using then you have no respect for the law. 1 pole per angler was put into place for a reason who are you to say it doesnt make a difference??? I guess all of the work and research that the Ontario Goverment and MNR have done means nothing cause its OK to fish with two rods.... Think about what you are saying I know you are just trying to start a stir. Why not start a stir on something intellegent.. This is total ludacrist Its wrong everyone knows its wrong.... Robin"
4088,irishfield,2006-11-23 00:55:00,26272,Looking at Ron's pics I'm pretty sure it's 46E 30667 or 48E 30667. If that brings up a Legend...bingo!
4091,Spiel,2006-11-23 01:01:00,9065,  ....I used a large magnifying lens and I'm sure it says as posted by Wayne....46E 30667
4092,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 01:03:00,3382,I have a fractal program if whomever has the original will send it to me I can make it clear rick at ofncommunity dot com
4095,Brian,2006-11-23 01:06:00,33,"That there makes my stomach turn.  But I am with you on this one Wayne,  I thinkit is 46E 30667 near as I could decipher.  Lets get 'em  Brian"
4104,setomonkey,2006-11-23 01:14:00,872,"Wayne,  You either have a way better computer screen than I do or you're a lot better at reading blurry images.  Must be the pilot eyes!    Mike"
4111,Terry,2006-11-23 01:20:00,14456,I tried Genuine Fractals Print Pro but with the  originals we just might get it
4124,irishfield,2006-11-23 01:29:00,26272, Could have been training from the 20 years that I did drink and things were blurred...or could have been 25 years of squinting to make signs readable...before I realized I needed glasses! 
4129,Ron,2006-11-23 01:36:00,1683,"Isent the originals off to the pair of ya. Good luck with them.  Wayne, I tried the sqinting thing too, didn't work for me. Next, I'll try a few Ceizures, see if that works."
4138,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 01:54:00,3382,I looked at all three pics and came up with 46E 39557... Just my opinion on what those nubers read. Based this on 3 different angles and using a few jpeg repair and fractal plug ins. 
4141,Terry,2006-11-23 02:00:00,14456,here is what I thought  
4144,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 02:03:00,3382,"Well we narrowed it down to 2 possible boats, Terry. Too bad we don't have access to the registration database... Anyone here work for Revenue Canada??"
4150,Rattletrap2,2006-11-23 02:08:00,1652,"Great work guys! I would have to go with Terry on this one. Just comparing the first ""6"" to the second one.  Surely someone from the MNR can run a check and come up with a hit. They know the boat and have a good set of numbers to work with. Photographic evidence and all."
4155,Terry,2006-11-23 02:16:00,14456,first CSI Vegas then CSI Miami then CSI new york    NOW........CSI  OFC Community......LOL
4157,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 02:18:00,3382,I think he gets another ticket for having the numbers too close together
4179,danc,2006-11-23 03:02:00,4677,I like the way that this is going so let's keep it right up top for a while. Great work guys..
4202,Carp,2006-11-23 05:06:00,1488,"Quick, what's  the sequence of numbers for the missle launch ?  Ultimate morons !!!"
4207,Nemo,2006-11-23 05:44:00,727, Which one?
4211,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 06:35:00,3382,Another thing I noticed was in one of the other shots Ron sent was that the hull was very stained. IF there is a marina nearby he may be a seasonal docker.
4226,Gerritt,2006-11-23 12:16:00,6129,"Nemo, the one in the orange survival suit.... notice the BCE Hat?  Gerritt."
4228,graftongal,2006-11-23 12:23:00,145,"If there isn't already such a thing as undercover CO's, there should be.  I think that would have positive results for crap like this."
4242,ccmtcanada,2006-11-23 14:00:00,7971,"Wow...just read this thread in detail.  Since I cant afford a boat, I just looked at the pic this first time and didn't even pick up on how many lines he had in the water.  Great work everyone on the registration number, but I have a suggestion that may generate more hits to this thread....making it sticky is great, but can we changed the subject to make it more urgent?  Maybe something like....""Help ID these Guys...Who has access to boat registration info?""  or hmmm...  ""Attention Conservation Officers....""  or....well you get the picture....  Cliff"
4248,tonyb,2006-11-23 14:20:00,1637,"It always amazes me that there are no C.O.s ever piping in on any of the Internet boards.  I guess when they get home after work, hopping online to break up schoolyard scuffles would seem like more work...  Those guys in the picture do know what they are doing and obviously have lots of cash.  I have seen more and more cases of highly experienced anglers poaching/breaking regs than the usual stereotypes.  The bad thing about this is that the knowledge these people have allows them to be much more effective, thus impacting the fishery way worse than someone who was poaching that wasn't an experienced angler.  The flip side of this is, since you won't get busted, why not try to get away with it?  I know it's wrong ethically, but it's like the people I work with who come in late and leave early every day.  Since they won't get busted, they push the envelope and ultimately work much less for the same or more pay than their co-workers, I say good for them!  Such a messed up world we live in eh?  Tony"
4262,wuchikubo,2006-11-23 14:43:00,1114,"Yeah, let's remember to remind CO of our website the next time we get a chance to chat with them! I don't have a boat (yet) but that sight would get me riled up as well.  Let's bust these poachers!"
4267,Nemo,2006-11-23 14:52:00,727,Wow Gerritt you have better eyes than I do.
4272,bigfish1965,2006-11-23 14:58:00,3382," Just like Tony descrived ... this is pretty much what it comes down to. Imagine if we took all the OPP off of the 401. At first, only the worst of us would take advantage, but eventually the numbers of speeders and dangerous drivers would climb till it seemed there was no point in remaining legal. This sort of stuff will get worse before it gets better."
171,Ron,2006-11-16 01:21:00,1683,I just love his rod holders for Lake St. Clair  
174,Handlebarz,2006-11-16 01:24:00,3790,I wanted the pic with the VIN number on it Ron to bad they turned away again stupid f@#ks
178,irishfield,2006-11-16 01:29:00,26272,Hey Ron..what's up with you posting on two boards and all ! LOL  Maybe they had 6 little tiny wimmins all cuddling up in the bow.  Gotta hand it to them...4 rods out each side without tangling....sure be a mess if they actually hit a 50!  Times like that almost make it worth pulling the line out of your prop!!
240,graftongal,2006-11-16 11:56:00,145,That's too funny Ron!  We saw them too.  I can't believe the blatant ignorance some people have.  I took pictures of them too hoping they'd get the hint.  Apparently not!
246,robin,2006-11-16 12:48:00,46,Sweet I wonder how many those two will fish with next year on St Clair when its 2 rods per angler 16????? Robin
1915,ChrisK,2006-11-18 22:09:00,2772,"I love the look on the guys face in the red float suit.... ""Sheeeit, I think we've been busted"""
1932,Gerritt,2006-11-18 22:57:00,6129,He is wearing Bell Canada Issued Winter Gear.  Gerritt.
1933,Muskyfanatic,2006-11-18 22:58:00,3,"That is just unbelievable! By the looks of the boat they've been fishing a while and should no better, which leads me to beleive they knew exactly what they were doing  If you see them again get their vessel number?   Cheers,"
1939,bigfish1965,2006-11-18 23:11:00,3382,Ohh..that boat was made for poaching! Sad that there are so few CO's left that poachers know they can do it in broad daylight.
1944,Handlebarz,2006-11-18 23:24:00,3790,Well if I get out there tomorrow and they are there I will try and get a better pic we tried that day wit hRon to get one but they kept turning away they shure know what they are doing as they are 100 feet from the shore at times.
1948,misfish,2006-11-18 23:49:00,29133,Did they have a WHITE bucket too???????????????
1954,BLACKFISH88,2006-11-19 00:05:00,191,whatever happened to citizens arrest damn prolly have to sit on em for a week for a co to show up i dont see why the ministry cant extend some authority to city police maybe we should lobby the government for some funding to train city police about regs... half the time they are sitting right by the water doing absolutely squat when we go fishing so i cant see why they cant be doing it........
1991,tip-up,2006-11-19 02:21:00,94,   Some people will never learn...
2024,Blake,2006-11-19 03:16:00,418,too bad guys like these are not caught and fined.  Good on ya taking pics maybe next time they will think twice.
2085,GbayGiant,2006-11-19 05:14:00,1780,"OMG.   If you can set 8 rods like that and not get tangled your an experienced enough angler to know the rules, these guys just don't care. I wish they would change Gbay to 2 rods though, musky fishing by myself with one lazy lure seems impossible at times.  I wonder if I can get my dogs some licences next year and put 3 lines out."
2156,fishboy,2006-11-19 14:37:00,550,I'm sure they were just rinsing those lures off...
2173,Jigger,2006-11-19 15:03:00,1237,"I don't suppose anyone saw them putting in or they would've got a plate# from their vehicle? On a body the size of St.Clair that 30hp couldn't have launched far from the spot they were ""fishing""."
2195,Handlebarz,2006-11-19 15:53:00,3790,  You can see in the back ground how far from shore they were they launched 30 seconds from the spot they were fishing noone knew what vehical was theres as many boats were out.  I see this pic is getting around so they know that they were seen keep this pic alive and maybe take some of your own to post here maybe if we have a thread for pics of poachers they will get the hint
2208,Cookslav,2006-11-19 16:13:00,1457,"Thats ridiculous?  Some big balls to pull off a stunt like that....or small brains, maybe even a combination of the 2?  Misfish I love your signiture....LOL"
2318,misfish,2006-11-19 19:35:00,29133, 
2325,Rizzo,2006-11-19 19:52:00,4754,wow what blatant disregard for the law. not even an atempt to hide what they are doing.
2473,danc,2006-11-20 01:43:00,4677,"I just want to bump this to put the image of these scum suckers on top again. The look on the face of the guy looking back makes me sick. We should make this a sticky in hopes of somebody recognizing these idiots and turning them in. Also, post this photo to any and all other message boards that you may happen to frequent. Let's work hard to nail these guys. Surely somebody must know or recognize them.  "
2537,bigfish1965,2006-11-20 03:56:00,3382,"Uhhh....you have a button now, remember?"
4066,Ron,2006-11-23 00:11:00,1683,"Glad to hear these pictures are getting around. Like everyone said, it would be nice to see these peices of slime get caught. regardless of their background, whether they are members of this board, or another board, these are people I do not want to associate myself with.  Here are a few more pics, low light conditions and distance between the boats didn't help on the clairity.      Yes, we could have made out the vehicle they were driving, it was a black Ford pickup. Unless you are in a situation like this yourself, you have no idea on how you would react. At first I wanted to confront the pond scum. Createing a scene was not my idea of enjoying the weekend though. I would perfer to go back to St. Clair on my own time, not court time possibly facing assault charges.  Perhaps the miricle of Photo Shop would clear up these images to ID the vin numbers on the boat."
4076,Terry,2006-11-23 00:35:00,14456,"I tried to clear it up but not much luck,,just can't make out the numbers wish I had the program CSI has      "
