Glad to see guys and gals gettin into nice fish and sharing your stories.  However, something I've been noticing that I wanted to bring up....  I've seen a lot of big fish being mishandled for pics.  Mainly, fingers in the gills.  I don't want to discourage posting of pics, rather incourage proper handling of fish.  Even for a big walleye you only need 2 fingers under the gill plate and never should any fingers go between the gill rakers.   Also, go under the gill that is on your side of the fish, not the camera side.  Keep up the good fishin everyone.  Cheers, ben."
