5057,woodro,2006-11-25 19:14:00,168,"headed out with Tridanguiding service out of port perry this morning. Dan (the guide)is a good buddy of mine has been scouting some areas for waterfowl. He told me about a property he manages only 20mins from the GTA, he was ranting and raving that there's been a ton of mallards and geese buzzing the area. So we brought the video camera in hopes of filming a good shoot and MAN was it ever a great shoot. We had the birds flying steadily over us from about 7am till 9.30 approximately. And honestly estimating close to 1000 mallards flew over us, it was absolutley incredible to watch, i was giggling in my coffin blind the entire time because ive never seen that many birds. But heres the ironic part of the entire situation...the video camera wasnt working, it was recording sound but no picture for some reason. I was a little peeved about it, but we managed to get some vids with my digi cam which hopefully turn out alright. anyways here are the results....6guys 36birds... 2 pin-tail, 1 black, 20 drakes, 13 hens. it was awsome!!!

5084,fishindevil,2006-11-25 21:22:00,6254,"sounds like a great hunt,and amazing results,you guys will be eating well for a long time.....way to go"
5191,cityfisher,2006-11-26 03:33:00,959,good job woood..... how many you get ?  I shoulda been invited ! !
5278,Carp,2006-11-26 15:43:00,1488,Sounds like an awesome day dspite the camera problems.  Congrats.
5280,woodro,2006-11-26 15:54:00,168,"ya the camera was a bummer but the meal tha tcame out of it last night was great. I made some indian food with the duck breast. Im not even sure what its called but it was damn good...and i can feel it cleaning the pipes as we type.  you know me spee, i at least dropped 5 ducks out of the bunch. We were hunting in a row so i mean a lot of the pellets might have been hitting the same ducks, but honestly i was so excited to see the size of the flocks that came in i forgot to load my gun twice!! It was a riot!"
5309,Clampet,2006-11-26 17:45:00,1947,"I checked out the website, you showed as a link and I was quite impressed with the services offered to Waterfowlers.  I think $150.00 is reasonable."
5325,woodro,2006-11-26 18:51:00,168,"this wasnt meant to be a plug for my buddies guiding service, but $150 is very reasonable for a hunt like that."
5328,pameladallaire,2006-11-26 19:42:00,470,Cool.
5500,dustink,2006-11-27 13:31:00,526,"Wow...nice report!  I was in the blind on Saturday AM and saw a couple small flocks of ducks / geese, but all high flyers, and couldn't get them to come in.  Congrats on a great day a'field!  dk"
5502,Harrison,2006-11-27 13:36:00,2202,"Nothing like pulling ducks into the field.. especially those pintails.. that is awesome!!!  Now for the Nongoun Poop Plant geese.. ewwwww, wash your dogs mouth out good... hahah..."
5604,woodro,2006-11-27 18:08:00,168,"i was actually really surprised, we only had three flocks of geese come over us. They didnt land becaue the corn was a little high still, this week should be good after the farmer plows the field again."
