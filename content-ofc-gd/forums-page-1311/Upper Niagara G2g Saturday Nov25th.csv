4613,Squid,2006-11-24 14:07:00,1656,"Can't wait until tomorrow, the girls are just waiting out there for all of us to show up."
4924,fishdawg,2006-11-25 03:53:00,912,something has come up & I wont be at the swill afterwards - have a good day everyone - I hope some success is found!
4963,Joey,2006-11-25 09:51:00,9122,"Have a great day everyone.  We'll see you there soon.  Out the door shortly.  Who gets up at this time in the morning besides crazy fishermen anyhow?    Oh ya, Lew  Joey"
5419,PatB,2006-11-27 02:23:00,104,Did I miss something????? Where are the reports?????
5426,bpsbassman,2006-11-27 02:50:00,941,"Pictures, we want pictures!!!"
5541,Fang,2006-11-27 15:13:00,1330,"Not much to report from my boat.  Picked up Goran (Uncle Buck) early Sat and drove through some nasty fog to niagara. Met Lew, Squid and others at the boat ramp.  Headed downstrem to Lake Eire and trolled a series of humps we found in 30 FOW. Tons of bait out there but you could read a bottle cap on the botom the water was so clear. Saw a lot of bass, walley guys out there. Headed back into the river and trolled cast a couple of rivermouth areas.  Saw Lew and Squid fishing 1 spot so we decided to do some casting along shoreline. The whole shoreline from the river inlet down 100yds was covered in small shiners. If you ripped a bait through them you sliced up a couple dozen.  Ended up drifting bulldawgs over some current breaks just off the baot ramp but no luck river was just way toooooo clear. Fished in nice sunny skis all day.  never saw or heard of any other action."
5554,Squid,2006-11-27 15:56:00,1656,Report will be posted tonight after work.
5564,Uncle Buck,2006-11-27 16:30:00,1000,"Special Thanks goes out to Paul for having me on his boat.  Paul is a great guy and a lot of laughs and info was shared through out the day...  Upper Niagara Report...    Good seeing you again Pete and Lew, also met a couple of new faces, Rizzo and his friend Alvin"
5569,Squid,2006-11-27 16:51:00,1656,
5805,Rizzo,2006-11-28 02:17:00,4754,"I love the skunk...got a spare one for my boat?  We had pretty much the identical day...lots of trolling, jigging and a bit of casting.  Saw lots of sheephead scurrying around...rotten basterds didn't want to hit a magnum bulldawg, go figure.  Most action we had was a smallmouth bass folloing a depthraider back to the boat"
5809,Squid,2006-11-28 02:24:00,1656,"Boy, Lew and I had a great boat ride on Saturday  I arrived at the niagara parks marina at 7.05, bloody fog... slowed me down, to find Rizzo, Alvin, Uncle buck, Lew and fang already there. Sun was just breaking through the trees and not a breeze. Temps were 2 degrees but that did not last long. We all launched and headed out for some muskie fishing. Water temps were 41degF and visibilty was up 25 feet in some places. Yes 25 feet, crazy. By 9.00Am Lew and I were removing layers of clothes to keep up with the rising temperatures. It topped out somewhere between 12 and 14 deg. We managed to put 44 miles on the boat and not a sniff. The sunny skies, clear water and lack of any real wind did not help the situation. We tried a few areas around the mouth of the river but there was no fish out there either.    Here is fang and Uncle buck working the river hard.  "
5814,Squid,2006-11-28 02:38:00,1656,"Here is Joey and Tybo trolling up river in the triangle.     And Alvin and Rizzo working the river shoreline.      As mentioned it was a great day to be out on the water. It was nice to meet some fellow OFC'rs and do a little fishing together. Lew and I worked the river until 6.30PM and then called it a day. 11 hrs on the water and nada, oh well off to the lizard for wings and a wobbly  . Arrived at the Lazy lizard in Saint Catherines to find Joey and Tybo [Paul] already there. I could not help but notice that the leafs were losing 2-0 to Boston [ Carp and Jim  ] . We managed to find a booth and settle down to wings and refreshments. We met Rick, Dr. Feelgood and Fishstick from the NFN. All of us felt tired and called it a night, after spending all that time in the sun . Cheers."
5821,Rizzo,2006-11-28 03:05:00,4754,"sweet georgia brown!  didn't know you and Lew worked it well past dark.  Good for you, I gave up around 3:30 and called 'er a day"
5895,Fang,2006-11-28 13:44:00,1330,I laughed at that picture of UB and myself in the boat. Do you realize I'm standing on top of the front casting platform and Goran (UB) is standing on the floor of the boat. He's still taller than me.
5898,Uncle Buck,2006-11-28 13:52:00,1000," Note: to all you kids out there... Drink Milk, does a body good"
5926,Joey,2006-11-28 15:05:00,9122," Hahaha, that's hilarious.  Milk eh Uncle Buck  Joey"
2626,Squid,2006-11-20 14:05:00,1656,"This coming saturday, Nov 25th, a few of us are heading to the upper niagara river to do some muskie fishing. All are welcome to attend, with a boat. Meeting at the niagara parks marina on niagara parkway at 7Am. So far, Lew, Robin, Joey and Tybo are coming."
2669,TAH,2006-11-20 15:06:00,133,thanks squid but my boat is now in dry dock for the year.   TH
2836,Squid,2006-11-20 19:51:00,1656,BUMP

2956,Pigeontroller,2006-11-20 23:02:00,2793,"Its lookin' as if i'll be there...My pardner managed a 42""er yesterday outa that stinkin' river."
3083,Rizzo,2006-11-21 02:26:00,4754,"if the weather cooperates, and work cooperates, and the wife cooperates...I'll see you there.  Pretty sure that restaurant on the water over by Netherby is gone now."
3084,Guest gbfisher,2006-11-21 02:27:00,0,I'm still waiting to see the last pictures from yer other trip out not to long ago. Unless I  missed them which is highly possible......
3128,fishdawg,2006-11-21 03:22:00,912,"The members from Niagara Fishing . Net are having there swill @ The Lazy Lizzard on Saturday evening. Lazy Lizard is at the Henley Plaza right next to the north side of the QEW / Ontario St on ramp/exit (across the road from Timmy's) From what i understand, the NFN'rs have graciously extended an invite for all to attend. All you can eat pizza & wings for $8."
3195,cplummer,2006-11-21 09:14:00,165,how did you boys make out on that muskie trip anyhow???? cliff...
3219,Squid,2006-11-21 12:56:00,1656,"Cliff, Gb we landed a total of 6 muskies over the weekend. They were caught on friday and monday. The weekend was a write off. Dawg, I will head out to the lizard after the day is doen."
3226,Squid,2006-11-21 13:12:00,1656,  Caught on LSC weekend.
3276,Fang,2006-11-21 14:50:00,1330,"Hey Squid  I hate the idea of putting the boat away so I'm considering heading down on Saturday. Set up for muskie but never fished upper river before. Can you give me a 25 cent run down on what to expect  Trolling or casting? I see the big swim baits have been talked about - Storm, bulldawgs.  Is there sufficent CDN water to fish or is it mostly on US side?   I have a 1750 crestliner w/115 Merc,  and an open seat if I go. Anyone vewing this board who has fished this area before but doesn't have a ride for the day PM me. I need some peer pressure to get me off my ars."
3289,Squid,2006-11-21 15:24:00,1656,"Fang there is plenty of water to fish on the canadian side. US license costs 40 dollars for the year. Mostly trolling waters but some do drift with bulldogs and storm rubber baits. Believers,jakes, plows ets will work on the river."
3322,Fang,2006-11-21 16:32:00,1330,"Thanks,  with luck we'll see ya down there. Looks like I got a partner already  VHF's on channel 16/72"
3797,Squid,2006-11-22 14:01:00,1656,"so we have the following coming out: Lew Robin Squid pigeontroller fang rizzo[maybe] joey tybo sandy[maybe] adam[maybe] Fang unlce buck  looks like a good time is in the works!!  Sunny, north winds at 6k and +10C. Except for the sun, everything is looking great for saturday."
3816,Ron,2006-11-22 14:41:00,1683,"More of the LSC skies.            OK, who's got room in their boat? Or who has experience on the Niagara that would go with me in my boat?  Canadian side only, not interested in getting an American licence."
3865,fishdawg,2006-11-22 16:04:00,912,"love the ""trout spots"" on that second 'ski"
3866,fishnsled,2006-11-22 16:09:00,3520,I'd love to get out there with ya Ron but have prior commitments for Saturday.  I'm also lacking in the knowledge department for  that area.  I've got the charts but that is all.      Good luck Ron if you make it down there and good luck to everyone else making the trip.  Fishnsled.
3894,Fang,2006-11-22 16:51:00,1330,Uncle Buck and I will be there!  Hopefully I'll learn some things
3908,Squid,2006-11-22 17:43:00,1656,"If you want to learn something fang, you will have to come out in our boat    JK bucky"
3951,Uncle Buck,2006-11-22 20:00:00,1000,"I'm gonna hit below the belt here...  couple of years ago on the December 15th Upper Niagara Musky get together, I remember everyboat getting skunked... Including yours Pete...  couldn't resist, sorry bud!!"
3956,Raf,2006-11-22 20:14:00,3495,That's because I was in Pete's boat and my luck runs out somewhere around september.  Go get'em guys.  There's been some nice fish coming out of the river this fall.
3970,Squid,2006-11-22 20:54:00,1656,no worries UB!! see ya on saturday.
3977,lew,2006-11-22 21:07:00,12767,"Uncle B, we had an excuse for getting skunked at the g2g two years ago.  It's tough to catch a fish when you can't see the water for the snow  See ya'll on Saturday  "
