5392,ccmtcanada,2006-11-27 01:10:00,7971,"My wife (blyght) and I had the pleasure of meeting up with fishindevil and fishergirl72 last night at our place.  Our first meeting of fellow OFC members was great!  Even the kids had a great time together.  Anyhow, fishindevil invited me to join him on what may have been his last BOQ trip of the year.  I was honoured to be the first guest on his new Lund!!! Even fishergirl72 hasn't been aboard as of yet!  Let me tell you, it's an awesome boat!  We were in the water at daybreak, 7:00am, and it was overcast, a warm 9C (48F for our American members) with a light south wind.  It was hard to believe we are only a few days away from December with this kind of weather.  We headed out and we each caught 1 nice Walleye in the first hour.....here are some pics....  Here was my catch....approx 9 lbs    fishindevil brought this one in...a nice 11 pounder    The bite was off after that, but I learned a lot from fishindevil today.  Thanks fishindevil....hope we can get out again some time.  Oh yeah...it was different fishing with daylight...LOL"

5437,Dondorfish,2006-11-27 03:39:00,1000,I believe that you were talking to my fishing partner (skeeter ). I was out at the car/boat. My buddy came out and said that he may have led you to believe that it was his boat   I broke the skunk but barely - one walleye at 6lbs 3 ozs   and a pike a little bigger    Don
