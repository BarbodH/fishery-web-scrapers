6000,setomonkey,2006-11-28 17:41:00,872,"pikeie,  unfortunately, with ""throwaway"" electronics it's usually cheaper to get a new phone/camera/printer whatever than it is to repair it, unless it's a really minor fix.  you might be out of luck with your phone, but like Rick says, you can get a cheap phone if you are willing to sign a 3-yr contract.
