5460,RSB,2006-11-27 11:47:00,9,"With the cold weather coming, it may have been my last trip for the year...      Although I am not putting the boat away just yet!!  My brother and I headed out to Pitcon again yesterday.. It was not like last weekend, that was a trip of a lifetime.. And I was not expecting to go 14 for 17 again..  We did manage to go 3 for 5 and the weather was AWESOME to top it off..  Started with a 9.5lb baby..    Then a 10..    And one more ten..    We lost the second and the last fish.. OH WELL.. All fish came on planners, the dippsy's did not fire off once all day..  Hopefully I'll be able to get out there one more time, if not, it was a fine way to end the fall..  I guess it's time to BRING ON THE ICE!!!!    Oooooops.. How did this pic get in here??    Can't wait to chase these bad boys around next year!!  RSB!!"
