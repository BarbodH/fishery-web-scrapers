5808,Lostchild,2006-11-28 02:23:00,153,"So here's the deal, I have a  12ft. fibreglass boat that I want to give away. It needs a good wash/paint and has a small crack that needs repair. (easy fix) I have no trailer for it, so you must have a way to transport it outta here. A pickup, full size van or roof racks would do. It weights less 100lbs and is great for small lakes with a trolling motor on the back. I live in Scarborough, Markham and 401 area. PM if you are interested. "
