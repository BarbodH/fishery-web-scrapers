3640,Dondorfish,2006-11-22 02:07:00,1000,Know what ya mean Wayne - Lotsa fishing trips I have had a hard time falling asleep the night before ( this one included ) but I have never had any trouble getting up to go!   Don
3920,robin,2006-11-22 17:58:00,46,"You guys are all  like a bunch of nattering old ladies LOL Glad some of you had good times. It is always tough getting everything all planned when your relying on so many people. But wanye is right more communication threw the board is always good it can never hurt. I think the biggest problem with the BoQ get together is that everyone is sepperated between diffent motels and campgrouds, that is why Lakair is so nice everyone in the same area... Just my 2 cents Robin"
4139,Carp,2006-11-23 01:55:00,1488,"WOW !!! Just read this post. Didn't realize I caused such a stir by fishing solo. Not the first time I've done it and probably not the last either.  Yes, blackfish88 slept in Sun. morning. Power/alarm problems. It happens. I called him to see how long he would be to get to the lake. I actually woke him up when I called and he told me to head out fishing without him because he didn't want to hold me up any longer.  Wayne, I guess you didn't know I spoke to him after leaving your cabin. It was actually 8:30am when I was at your place because I left and called him at 8:45am from Tip of the Bay parking lot. You're right about it being easier to fish with a partner in those conditions though. I didn't want to impose on anyone for a spot to sleep. Could have slept on someone's floor, but I survived just fine in the van. Started her up a couple of times to warm up the interior through the night. That spicy food I ate for dinner kept waking me up, hence the potty trip to your place in the am.  Everyone in the same place is the best scenario, but it isn't easy with such a large group.    Let's all play nice."

5152,POLLIWOGG,2006-11-26 01:26:00,835,Here's a spot you might be interested in www.pec.on.ca/deerhaven/ its about 10 min from picton.
5442,HookedOnOut,2006-11-27 04:14:00,1,"I am new to your board and would like offer all OFC members that come to Quinte next year or anytime , that if you need to stay as a big group ,that I can arrange for your members to stay at the Ramada in Belleville. I have an arrangement that if you book under Hooked On Outdoors  you will get boat parking , hydro hook up for your boats and there is security.The ramps are a 25 min drive and if you have a group I would be happy to arrange seminars at night for you.If you are coming by yourself or a small group  contact me and the same will apply. I will contact the Ramada and reserve your rooms. There are indoor pools, Lounge , Bar Etc. I have read this post and this would be a way to have your group in one place at very reasonable rates, of which I do not make anything from!!!. Also you would be minutes away from Carra Outdoors  shopping and Restaurants. This is a positive web site with lots of good things going on!! Keep it up guys and stay Hooked On Outdoors!!!"
5506,BLACKFISH88,2006-11-27 13:51:00,191,Skevys' Outdoor specialties is also right across the street......from the ramada
3492,Terry,2006-11-21 21:50:00,14456,"yeah, but we go to BOQ this time of year to catch monster walleye and it's almost the only place in the world that you can do that...(and that's why I go) and they only move in this time of year  so while  Lakair is a  great M&G spot and has nice eatting size pickerel it doesn't have the chance of a 18.5lb walleye"
3493,irishfield,2006-11-21 21:50:00,26272," Blackfish..grow up. I'm just trying to make people aware of how better communications could make everyone's fishing trip more enjoyable for next time. Not beating on anyone and if you think so well I guess that's your choice. Remo came to our cottage said he had called you and you were supposed to call him back. It was now 9:30 and he still hadn't heard from you. If I had of wanted to single you out I would have put your name in print, which I did not...and if we had of known he was going to be out alone...or if Stan had of hung around he wouldn't have been sitting on shore at the ferry dock....he would have been on the water. There were other cases of this as well...just not going to list them all as not necessary to make the point of COMMUNICATIONS."
3522,BLACKFISH88,2006-11-21 22:33:00,191,"I'll be leaving Friday night or early Saturday morning from Mississauga, making a stop in west end Toronto to pick up the boat. Driving down solo.  Ya, I know.  Waited too long, last minute, no space, all booked, ..... Guess I may have to sacrifice my body in the name of fishing and shack up with the local cougars if I can't get a floor spot. Ahhh, life is good in Canada....no ???  I'm waiting to hear back from blackfish88, so I'll have room for 1 or possibly 2 in the boat. Let me know if anyone needs a boat to fish in. Anyone want to fish with the best walleye guide in the world ? Well, he's probably busy, so you can fish with me instead.                          Real sad you got stood up like the ugly girl on prom night Remo! Just don't understand people sometimes. Lots of screw ups at Quinte this year in my honest opinion...I really don't get how some people think.    ////////growing up has nothing to do with it bud. I honestly did not hear him say to call him back if I was coming he called and woke me up and I said to go ahead without me. I don't think throwing insults helps the situation either re (grow up). sure looks like print to me not directly but it's there and the assumption made."
3534,fishindevil,2006-11-21 22:57:00,6254,"yes i agree i showed up at merland park about 6am sturday morn told one OFC mrmber i was alone ,in my boat then came back to merland 2 times sat night to maybe meet a few guys and never met anyone i fished solo all weekend and was only just 10mins walk to the sportsman hotel,i could have taken someone in my boat for sure ,maybe next time we can organize for sure...."
3540,fishdawg,2006-11-21 23:05:00,912,"group hug everyone! as its been said a Quinte trip is tough to plan perfectly - some people like Merlands, some dont The opportunity to catch above average walleyes is why Quinte is chosen - its tough to accomodate everyone at the same accomodations, because Quinte is world re-known for its fall fishery & the few beds that Picton has available, fill up quickly on weekends. Also Lakair (Nippissing) closes for fishing in mid-October anywayz  I was up in Picton for the day on Sat, but it was a last minute decision - also had to turn around & drive 3 1/2 hrs home, other wise woulda stopped in  @ the Merlands campfire for a visit - did see some of ya's on the water tho"
3580,Roy,2006-11-22 00:36:00,13728,"I got to meet and re-meet a good bunch of OFNers this past weekend, so I had a great time. I don't sweat the little stuff. Life tends to get complicated for me if I have to worry about what others are doing."
3591,Daplumma,2006-11-22 00:56:00,1961,Amen brother Roy.Part of the fun is the adversity!!Glad you made it there and back! Joe
3592,camillj,2006-11-22 00:57:00,1988,The beauty about fishing is it doesnt get cancelled if the 'other guy' doesnt show ... and ... imho ... it can be just as much fun .... anyhow ... I chime in only because I cam THIS CLOSE -><- to coming down un-spec on Staurday after picking my daughter up from Laurier ...but figured there wouldnt be any room in anyones boat and didnt wanna be the third wheel ....anyhow sounds like as always it was a bumper-crop of Reach- walleye  Next year ... IM IN !!!!! .... who wants me to prepay for a seat and a spot on the floor ?  :D
3600,Mike the Pike,2006-11-22 01:07:00,3421,Good to me meet you this weekend Roy.We will have to get together for some fishin this summer in the Boucherville Islands.That said.  What puzzles me is quinte's popularity is growing with less places to stay and many already closed in November.Now the tip of the Bay is being closed to be torn down for condo developement.Is this the future more condos and less space for the sportsman to stay.Merlands is going to need to expand .More docks cabins etc....Ok lets invest.  Mike
3607,irishfield,2006-11-22 01:15:00,26272,"Yep...ya gotta point Roy and it was great seeing you again and all the other OFC'rs we visited with in our cottage, around the fire beside our cottage, down at the Picton Inn and out on the water waving/cell phoning and VHF'ng as well.  Why do I bother worrying about how to make other guys lives a little easier...more enjoyable. Who am I to try and help them out, adding thoughts on how to make things go smoother for them next year so they can get out on the water. I'll just shut my mouth now...call Dano/Terry/etc on the phone and we'll do our own thing at BOQ next year and not worry about anyone else having fishing partners etc."
3615,Dondorfish,2006-11-22 01:32:00,1000,"Sure hope your just venting Wayne - Even thou we didn't catch any fish we really had a great time and CAN""T WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR! Sorry I missed you at Merlands but they said you were watching the hockey game. Did get to meet a great bunch of OFC'ERS thou and had a great chat by the fire. Is there a date set for next year yet or is it set closer to the time -  I want to book at Merlands for next year - you guys are crazy!!!! Please don't let the opinion of one person ruin your efforts. I for one have very much appreciated all your help and information over the last year. I look forward to next years outing and hope that maybe then I can catch one of those darn Quinte walleye.   Thanks Again    Don"
3631,irishfield,2006-11-22 01:59:00,26272,We didn't lock the door Don...you should have just walked in. The campfire was beside our cottage..the Walleye Wonder.  Yah...I'm venting. Never heard of anyone hyped for fishing that slept in in the morning. Lots that had a wife that said no ..... way bud though!
