Most of my perch were very small with the occasion 9” or 10”.  My friend caught a 14” along with bigger fish (then mine) by casting larger bait ahead of the drift.  The bigger perch get spooked easily. Thanks to the new navionics that my buddy’s boat equipped, otherwise we would never be able to make it back to Pefferlaw in thick fog and mist. It was a bonus two days on open water.  Good fishing.  About a dozen boats fishing on Sunday, very calm water by the ferry.  Everyone we talked to were catching fish and having fun...  Made a friend on Monday…she was hanging around our boat for about 10 minutes hoping for released perch.  Beautiful bird.  Unfortunate the camera got wet and other pix didn’t turn out. "
