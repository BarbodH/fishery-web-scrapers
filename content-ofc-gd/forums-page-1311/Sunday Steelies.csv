To start,  I got home Saturday night (Sunday morning) at 4am with the booze heavily absorbed  in my blood stream.  We had been at a 70's disco party where I wore a monster black afro and flared clothing that was as tight as you can get.  At 5:30am the alwarm goes off and I hit snooze and must have fallen back asleep because next thing I knew it was 6:45am.  I jumped in the shower, grabbed my gear and started the car.  I had just received my new bluetooth GPS in the mail so I fired her up to see how it worked.  Paired with iGuidance on my iPAQ this GPS was awesome and I'm really excited to use it next time I head to new unvisited territory!!!  Anyways, I grabbed a Rockstar energy drink and drove east, grabbed a coffee whe I got closer and hit the trib about 8:15am. My buddy Todd was about 20 minutes upstream so I walked and walked and walked.  We fished until about 3pm with nothing more than 2 little 6 inch bows.  We found a number of pools where we could spot the fish since the water was so low and clear but they wouldn't take a thing.  We tried pink/orange roe bags, flies, pink worms and they were not interested.  Found one pool with some real heavy cover and Todd hooked into a biggie.  This thing took charge and pulled Todd around, including hang ups on a log and one pile of branches which Todd managed to get out of before ever letting the line break.  Fish landed and weighed in at 9lb.  We dedcided that the water was just to clear and the fish were not going to take a thing so it was time to leave.  I still had some roe on so I figured I'd try a few floats through the pool closest to the parking lot and it's a good thing I did.  I watched my float pop down and back up then down again so I set the hook and watch this beautiful chrome body fly two feet out of the water   She took off and I fought her for a good 7-8 minutes with two more acrobatic displays again with the full body flying out of the water.  Todd helped me land her and we admired the beautiful colours than let her go to swim another day.  I would say she was 4-6 lbs with a real wide fat body, must have been pre-spawn.  This was probably the best fish I have ever caught in terms of the fight and the action!   Chris"
