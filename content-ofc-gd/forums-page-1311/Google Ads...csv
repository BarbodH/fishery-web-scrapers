5705,Gerritt,2006-11-27 22:39:00,6129,How can I get rid of em??? everypage I visit on our OFC Forum has Google ads.... it is getting to be a bit much..  I dont think the mods get em.. how can I get rid of em too!!!  Gerritt.
5706,bigfish1965,2006-11-27 22:41:00,3382,They pay the rent. We see them too. Google ads are our friend. (keep saying that over and over again)
5707,Terry,2006-11-27 22:42:00,14456,the goggle ads are paying for the site if you don't want them send 300 bucks and they will disappear for a month  well I really don't know how much....
5708,steve_paul,2006-11-27 22:42:00,658,I think TJ posted last week that they had to be added to help pay for the site.  Not sure they can be turned off though.
5709,Gerritt,2006-11-27 22:45:00,6129,Google is my friend.... Google is my friend...Google is my friend....   Ahhh thats better..  Gerritt.
5710,setomonkey,2006-11-27 22:47:00,872,"The price to pay for a free site!  The ads aren't too bad, at least they aren't bandwidth eating multimedia like you find on some sites...  Mike"
5738,Raf,2006-11-27 23:47:00,3495,"I don't believe this is a 'free site' in the sense that someone has to pay for the software license, bandwidth & space (ie. TJ) The google ads I am sure help offset that cost."
5740,walleyejigger,2006-11-28 00:00:00,876,"was just checking who was around in the list and ""google.com"" is there, is it just me or that is odd"
5753,Roy,2006-11-28 00:28:00,13728,"Yes, you're quite right Raf. This is not a free site and the Google ads do help offset the costs involved in keeping  these sites running. It's not that bad at all though in that the Google ads are contextual ads.....meaning that they at least have something to do with  what we are talking about on a particular thread. In fact, there are sometimes some pretty neat ads showing up on there. sometimes.  WalleyeJigger, that is most likely a Google bot.....called 'spider' or 'crawler'. The newest version of this bot is actually quite sophisticated. Look it up on a search engine to find out what they do."
5758,PERCHER,2006-11-28 00:48:00,787,What Google ads .How come I dont see them?I must be blind.
5762,Gerritt,2006-11-28 01:00:00,6129,at the top under the OFC banner  Gerritt.
5764,trapshooter,2006-11-28 01:02:00,1234,Don't even notice them.  If they bug ya that much just don't look.
5766,dwc67,2006-11-28 01:14:00,140,i don't have banners. my norton blocks them
5773,danc,2006-11-28 01:20:00,4677,No Google ads here either.
5780,mepps,2006-11-28 01:33:00,1301,I dont seen any either...
5828,TJQ,2006-11-28 03:31:00,7806,"Yup.. they are here to stay..  believe it or not... this community is a bandwiths and space HOG... Weve been running them a week, ans it looks like they will be able to help pay the bills... so they are a neccessary part of the site.  There presence here will allow us to pay for the bandwidth.. which we may have to upgrade already.. lo.  as well as allowing us some dough to always be on top of upgrades and fixes so we dont have problems like what happened on the old photogallery ever ever again..."
5831,FishFinder,2006-11-28 03:43:00,481,"i dont know if im going to get in trouble for this, but if you are running firefox browser, Install this first, (its also great for other things too)  http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/  Then install this script..  http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/675  Works for all google ads"
5833,danc,2006-11-28 03:55:00,4677, Geez. Now I feel guilty because I can't see them...
5844,sturgman,2006-11-28 04:36:00,249,I dont see them either. Any reason why some here are seeing them and some arent?
5865,camillj,2006-11-28 11:41:00,1988,Firewall settings ... my KPF blocks em all ... funny .. because sometime I have to turn it off to see them (on purpose)
5866,Roy,2006-11-28 11:49:00,13728,You also will not see the ads if you have Java script disabled.
5869,Gerritt,2006-11-28 12:13:00,6129,"Well if they are indeed helping to pay the bills, and are offsetting the cost of running the site..... I suppose I should click on em every once and awhile.  Gerritt."
