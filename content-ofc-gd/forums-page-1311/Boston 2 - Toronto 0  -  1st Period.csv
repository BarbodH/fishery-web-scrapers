5342,KyleM,2006-11-26 21:19:00,218,I love Torontos consistancy. 7 goals the night before and 1 tonite.  I cant wait for the next game they play. I hope Chara gets ahold of that panzy Tucker.  Ref blindly missed that charging penalty.
5422,Blake,2006-11-27 02:38:00,418,The Leafs are falling as usual
5578,big guy,2006-11-27 17:19:00,414,"I hope Chara gets ahold of that panzy Tucker. Ref blindly missed that charging penalty.  Just how does someone 5'10"" charge someone 6'9"" anyway. He may have taken a few steps once he crossed the blueline, but he was gliding when he hit him. Clean hit. Charging calls should never be called on someone that big, a guy like Tucker is never going to hurt him, not in a hundred years. Take the hit and keep on going and that's exactly what he did. Good on Tucker for actually being able to knock him over."

SHAKE YER HEADS BOYS, Sundin will be back to form next game along with Raycroft.As for Charra and Tucker.Clean hit.I really had a good laugh when it took 2 players from boston to finally ty up Darc.Charra may have ripped Darc,s head off,but he was the last guy to get there.  How did he become Captian anyways.What a bafoon."
5590,Mike Pike,2006-11-27 17:45:00,1332,Hey Boston won a game!  ( I guess that must mean they're on the way up.  lol )
5836,boston,2006-11-28 04:01:00,25," I have no Idea and don't like it even as a die hard bruins fan, misfish, but if you don't think he could take tucker on his own, you should give your head a shake."
