5420,Terry,2006-11-27 02:32:00,14456,yeah that pissed me off too  and some guys were cleaning big fish two days in a row.. I guess they could each eat 10lbs of fish each day but I don't  think so
5423,nautifish,2006-11-27 02:39:00,1416,  Then why not call the ministry?  Two days in a row>?  Like someone allready said we need to help preserve and protect our fisheries.
5424,irishfield,2006-11-27 02:41:00,26272,"We were on the dock when two boats of them came in and they asked us if we knew what the regs where as to ""slot"" size. We informed them one fish over 25"" only. We thought it pretty strange to bring in fish and then ask what the regs on them...but none illegal from the two boats. Two guys in the smaller boat had 2 fish and three in the other had three fish.  Could have been a few guys given the job of cleaning the whole groups catch. A dicy area if a CO happened to walk in...but then again you'd never want a CO looking in the cleaning room at Lakair when we all throw fish at TJ and Kevin to clean to feed 60 of us for Saturday's fish fry."
5471,brifishrgy,2006-11-27 12:28:00,559,correct me if im wrong but with a size restriction dont you have to keep the fish whole so it can be measured by MNR?
5481,setomonkey,2006-11-27 12:47:00,872,"brfishrgy,  if you're cleaning the fish to bring home, you're supposed to leave a patch of skin so that COs can identify the species and, I guess based on the scale size, how big the fish was.  Mike"
5494,Terry,2006-11-27 13:19:00,14456,"well I had no proof..and if they did eat them or give them away, then they were breaking no laws....so yeah it pissed me off that they were killing fish that are too big to eat, IMHO I spoke to the guy cleaning them, and told them the size limit I even said they need to leave a patch of skin on them and said I was expecting the MNR to show up over the weekend....   I felt that talking to them would be the most effective way to handle it...."
5508,Stevejr,2006-11-27 13:56:00,13,"We all see things out there that piss us off each and every year. How many posts do we read that say some thing along the lines of not bothering to call the CO or not wanting to get involved. If we all sit idley by and watch these things happen then the fisheries will slowly be depleted. There is nothing wrong with calling on people. It is in our best interest. So what if they didn't know the reg's, thats the hole point, you gotta know the reg's. They must have known they might be doing something wrong or they would not have asked just to be sure!!! Ive called on people, seen guys snagging salmon, bows,carp.. all kinds of crap. Some times the CO's show up some times they dont, but its worth the call.  Thats my rant  Cheers"
5524,Terry,2006-11-27 14:43:00,14456,"I have called the police/mnr 5 times this year I've confronted  15 more people, taking pictures and driving up to their boats and telling them they are breaking the law.... I have almost come to blows with people over it...I dumped about 8 white buckets into the canal because they had bass in them before bass season, and never once has the police or mnr showed up in time to do anything, if they showed up at all.....so what have you done.....   I get pissed off and I do my part in spades...if I decide to talk to the guy rather then call the MNR is my decision...it's pretty easy to sit behind a computer and be all holy..so what have you done today"
5549,Headhunter,2006-11-27 15:49:00,5703,"I also observed those guys at Merlands cleaning up those double digits. DouG was there chatting with them and I wandered over for a look. When I was there, they had 4 hens on the choppin block, all double digits. As I had lost my voice that day, all I could do was whisper and I asked them ""are you guys gonna eat those fish?"" and the reply was ""well I'm not filletting them for practice"". Based on what I could see, they were within their rights to keep the 4 fish, there were four guys standing there all smiles slaughtering four of the bay's finest. They were obviously from ""outta province"" so I asked them if they had big fish like those where they come from and they laughed and said no, to which I responded ""well we won't have any left here if you guys keep keeping fish like these."" They only smiled and kept cutting... I know myself and FishnSled were pretty ""DISAPPOINTED"" that they did what they did, but as I said, it appeared that they ""were within their rights"". I see it every year, I bugs the crap outta me, but their's nothing we can do as long as the reg are, what the regs are. BTW -  I don't have a problem with an angler keeping a trophy for the wall, most guys will only keep one, in their lifetime so it's ok with me, but pure meat hunting.... it's sad! And to make matters even more rediculus, those fish (any Quinte walleye) TASTE LIKE CRAP! HH"
5799,POLLIWOGG,2006-11-28 02:06:00,835,I don't know how you could tell if a fish was 24 3/4 or 25 1/2 by the scale so I would guess that brifishrgy is right and the fish should be whole.  No offence but just because you don't know how to cook a big fish dosn't mean others don't.
5804,Terry,2006-11-28 02:17:00,14456,"what does"" ways of cooking"" have to do with a 20+ year old fish that the fish eatting books states you should not eat if over 22 inches and 20"" only 2 meals a year, but not by children or pregnat woman....oh yeah some good eatting there"
5806,irishfield,2006-11-28 02:20:00,26272,"Talked first hand with a gentleman that was charged last year because he didn't have the head to tail of the fish he'd cleaned to go along with the fillets he had in his cooler. He accepted the fine as his own stupidity/forgetfullness. Regs state if you are fishing a size limit lake the fish must be readily measurable at all times,  UNLESS and where it gets comfusing....they are being prepared for immediate consumption (which was what he was doing as heading for a shore lunch), prepared at an overnight accom for storage, being transported on the water from a temporary overnight accom to your primary residence and you are not engaged in fishing at the time, being transported overland. The last one would tell me that as soon as you are on the ramp you can fillet and discard the ""evidence"". Doesn't make a whole lotta sense to me."
5810,Roy,2006-11-28 02:27:00,13728,I don't eat the large fish myself but I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with them. Unless of course you're having them with a side order of fresh spinach and washed down with a glass of 'bio' carrot juice.
5816,Mike the Pike,2006-11-28 02:41:00,3421,
5817,camillj,2006-11-28 02:51:00,1988,"  We (two of us) kept a couple of the bigguns (one each) from last year .... sorry if it offends some .. but those were the only walleye either of us got to eat for the past two years (didnt make it out this year) so I dont really feel too guilty about it ... and IMHO they tasted FABULOUS ... I fully agree though that meat hunting is best done at the butcher.   On another note, when keeping fish from a slot-limit area not only are you required to keep some skin on the fillet but you must also keep the whole skeleton (head and Tail on) to show you were within the slot. Just a safety issue to avoid some poor uninformed guy who gets stopped and charged with a crime he didnt commit."
5843,POLLIWOGG,2006-11-28 04:35:00,835,Don't forget to wash it down with some brain cell killing booze and a couple after dinner smokes.
5857,Greencoachdog,2006-11-28 11:04:00,8163,"I ALWAYS like to fill my cooler before checking or asking about the regs, it sure is easier than throwing the over size, out of slot, and over the limit fish back! If after the fact I should find out that any fish are too big or if I have too many I fillet them and then cut them up into small pieces, that way if anybody checks them I tell them all the meat came from one giant fish.... as far as pollutants go, they aint killed me yet and add a nice Zing to the meat!"
6140,Stevejr,2006-11-28 22:03:00,13, Well... I did lots today... none of them have to be justified to you Terry! Its to bad you didn't get the results you were looking for when you tried to do what was right. But dont get pissed at me cause I voiced my opion. Dont judge me....you have no idea what I'm about or what I have or havent done.
6146,Terry,2006-11-28 22:22:00,14456,I'd reply  but why....lol...
6147,Roy,2006-11-28 22:23:00,13728,Ok...group hug.....
6152,misfish,2006-11-28 22:45:00,29133,"Terry................10 pounds of fish...................You seen me eat so have a other few from the board..............But from BOQ.................................NOT.LOL   I agree WHY BOTHER.....................   Come here ducky,I,ll give ya a hug"
6210,Stevejr,2006-11-29 00:30:00,13,Terry... what ever man....cheers and tight lines We can debate or complain all we want but there wiill always be people that abuse the rules.
