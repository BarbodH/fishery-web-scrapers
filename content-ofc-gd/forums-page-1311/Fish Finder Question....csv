First question is it safe to hook up all wires to it and leave it out on the snow, during ice fishin? And last where can i buy a 12 v battery? any good links for this? Is there any cheap ones? Saw one for 40 bucks."

The site is mainly about kayaks and rigging them but I think that the fish finder link will show you how to get power to the ff. Hope this helps.  PS Here is a second link that deals strictly with the batteries."
