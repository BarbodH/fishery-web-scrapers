I plan on staying in the Gravenhurst Bay area, am I correct in assuming the public wharf area would be the best place to launch and park? Also wondering what the lake is like when the wind picks up a bit, does it blow up like Simcoe or is it a little tamer? Just want to know what to expect as I don`t like surprises!  Thanks"
