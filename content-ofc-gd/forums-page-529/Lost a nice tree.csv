I was down the hiway at my buds place yesterday afternoon and was just leaving when I noticed the skies getting very dark. Within about 2 minutes it was like a mini-hurricane and the winds were howling and heavy rains were pouring down, but then  almost as fast as it started it was over again.  I was home in 10 minutes and found a nice 50' maple in my backyard had been snapped off like a twig. It was lucky though cause if it had come  just a bit this way it would have hit the house & deck.  My bud called a few minutes later to say he lost 3 big trees on his property at the same time.  Other than alot of downed trees I didn't hear of any serious damage or injuries around this immediate area  "
591326,Rich Clemens,2011-06-09 09:32:00,3131,You folks seems to have had your more-than-fair-share of nasty weather already this year.  Kinda sounds like we're in line for a little of that later on today.
591330,lew,2011-06-09 10:02:00,12766,Yeah we've seen some nasty stuff Rich but  it doesn't even come close to what folks in the southern US have seen lately.  I spose losing a nice tree is very minor compared to what others have lost.
591353,irishfield,2011-06-09 12:33:00,26272,I'll clean up your yard Lew... if you come clean up mine!!! Chain saw's gonna be busy for a few days here..
591355,lew,2011-06-09 12:39:00,12766,I imagine chain saws are gonna be busy all across Southern Ontario after the last couple days.
591358,jimmer,2011-06-09 12:52:00,2730,We were also very fortunate. We had trees landing five feet from the house and other trees holding up broken ones. The pool was saved by a few feet. Unfortunately hydro says we're going to be out until Saturday. I hope they're wrong. We will probably have to take down some good trees as they are so close and have always held each other up. That's the problem with large cedars. Heard a pilot lost his life on Balsam Lake when his plane was flipped over.

591364,Headhunter,2011-06-09 13:04:00,5703,Just Mother nature doing some pruning Lew... and maple burns really nice in the winter. Glad it didn't cause any more grief than it did. HH
591367,bigbuck,2011-06-09 13:20:00,2449,"There's some firewood for ya!!! Too bad, it was a pretty tree. I guess we know what you are going to be doing for the next couple of days."
591388,Joey,2011-06-09 14:15:00,9122,"Well at least you are all safe Lew, that's the important thing.  Now you have an excuse to go get a new tree"
591390,doubleheader,2011-06-09 14:17:00,497,"Lew, maybe you should take up building some gliders. You have all the wood you'll need!!!"
