590251,blaque,2011-06-06 15:47:00,2419,"I fished the catskills last week and thought id throw up some pics of my few days there. We got lucky and came in just as the water was shaping up from high and dirty conditions.  We mainly fished the hatches coming off the Beaverkill and Willowemoc. This was all dry flies, and as always.....thats an absolute blast.  Youll see some of the fishy pics, scenery pics, and some pics from the small town in the catskills that we stayed. Youll see covered bridges, the fly fishing museum, and a couple of the small fly shops in town. Which by the way, there are many.....                                                                                      "

Always want to head up to Lake Champlain, but I could catch 5-6 pound bass here, and for the scenery? Ontario had it beat."
