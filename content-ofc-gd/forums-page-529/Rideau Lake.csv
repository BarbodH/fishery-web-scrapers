590706,muskymatt,2011-06-07 21:35:00,2608,"Murphy point is a beautiful provincial park, Big Rideau lake is awesome. Clear water with lots of structure it offers great laker fishing along with excellent bass and good pike fishing, walleye can also be found in the shallower end of the lake. Lots of privacy at the park and a great launch and nice beaches, canoe rentals and night time activities. They also offer boat in camp sites and have a museum and a store.  I have been to the Rideau the last 13yrs in a row either camping or, more recently, renting a cottage on an island.  Good fishing, nice scenery, clear water....you can't go wrong."
590707,Cosmos,2011-06-07 21:39:00,588,  thanks man
590728,Terry,2011-06-07 22:32:00,14456,good bass pike crappie and even lake trout  I have never caught a walleye in the lake
590732,Rich Clemens,2011-06-07 22:47:00,3131,"I'll second/third the bass.  I'll be in Rideau Ferry this coming September.   We always do very well with bass and even run into the occasional 20"" specimen.    We Florida rig a 6"" worm and just wind drift across the weeds and typically have good success.   Early am and late evening, across the heavy / shallow weeds we'll switch over to top waters and have a blast.  I've been to Murphy's Point a couple times, just for a quick drive-through, but haven;t fished around that area."

590752,irishfield,2011-06-07 23:24:00,26272,"A great park... but I'm a little biased, my brother was one of the Scout Ventures that helped put it in during the 70's."
590803,muskymatt,2011-06-08 01:09:00,2608,  Her's a Laker from this past Sunday!
590843,muskymike,2011-06-08 01:54:00,772," We need to talk, I am glad you helped the OP but I live not 5 mins from Rideau Ferry. I want to get out on the lake but not a clue where to start. I can get to the water so fast, just not a clue where to go on it. Its a rather large body of water."
