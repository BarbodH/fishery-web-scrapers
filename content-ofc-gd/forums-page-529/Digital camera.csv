589777,shadowfly,2011-06-04 18:53:00,84,"Hey guys  i have to buy a new camera , my casio exilim fought hard for year and 3 months before breaking, it's the lens that got damaged. I need a digital camera that is suitable for fishing and hunting not shooting professional weddings here. i was looking at some of the shockproof cameras seems interesting but they are expensive. what do you guys use and how guys like it? also i don't see the need to spend more than $100 as it will get used and abused on a daily basics but if it's really worth it I'll spend extra 50$ on a digital camera."
589781,misfish,2011-06-04 19:02:00,29133,You  would be surprised what you can buy for 100 bucks at Shoppers drug mart. My old olympus did me fine for what your talking about.
589782,Handlebarz,2011-06-04 19:07:00,3790,I love Canon cameras and will buy nothing else after having a few others and problems with each. The wife just bought me the Ashot 1300 for christmas it is a nice small camera that can fit in a pocket I like the timers and burst shots I only get three pictures on the timer but that's better then most as they just give 1 shot. My last Canon I got 10 shots on the timer.

589786,Handlebarz,2011-06-04 19:21:00,3790,I don't know Brian the wife got it and I had not looked it up. I know they have some cheaper ones  the Canon Power Shot A490 is the one we got my daughter it was less then $100 it is also very nice 10.0 mega pixels  Just quick googled it looks like $140-200+ depending where the wife would have bought it.
589788,misfish,2011-06-04 19:31:00,29133,"Thanks. Like to have something I can just throw in my pocket. The one the mrs,s bought me is great,but big for hauling throw the bush all the time. Im working on some holders for the tree stands."
589842,zeeter,2011-06-05 01:07:00,92,"Hey.  I have an Olympus 710 and it's okay, but I think there are better weather proof models out there.  I just bought a DSLR camera and the below website helped me in my research.  It might help you find the right camera for your needs.  http://dpreview.com/"
589884,spinnerdoc,2011-06-05 04:54:00,556,"i have the olympus stylus 1050, shock proof and waterproof up to ten feet, a bit more than what you had in mind but i dropped it so many times and rested it's waterproof capabilities and it's been great"
589885,crossover,2011-06-05 05:42:00,172,"Lumix ts2, a bit on the pricey side ($300) but if you're spending triple digits may as well spend a bit more and get something of quality. If you're looking for a rugged/shockproof/waterproof camera, avoid fuji, their warranty doesn't cover water damage lol. I've also read reviews that the olympus cameras take too long to turn on."
589902,Terry,2011-06-05 12:06:00,14456,I don't think most of the people really read posts  he is looking for 100 to 150 bucks for a camera not 300 +
589903,Joey,2011-06-05 12:11:00,9122,Do you have any airmiles?  They have a pretty good selection of half decent cameras and if you have enough airmiles it will cost you nothing  Here's one for 1900 airmiles:  Shockproof/Waterproof Camera
589905,Blue Lk,2011-06-05 12:17:00,337,"I just bought a Kodak Sport for around 80 bucks at Walmart,12MP & waterproof to 3m.I am pleased with it so far  http://store.kodak.ca/store/ekconsus/en_CA/pd/EASYSHARE_SPORT_Camera__Red/baseProductID.222433400/productID.223152000"
590150,Jewelbee,2011-06-06 08:31:00,422,I recently bought a Samsung digital at WalMart for under 100. Really small. Fits in a pocket easily. Has a 5x zoom and macro. Takes good video too! Not water proof though.
