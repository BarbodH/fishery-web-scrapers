I saw a window of oppurntunity, so off I went to lake O for chromies I launched out with decent skies above me, the winds were just right  I stopped at the location I wanted to fish, no fish on the finder but I knew they were there. So down the lines go, within a 1/2 hr one line goes off ,A shacker that shook himself off . I trolled for an hour or so afterwards, and my lines tripped a few times without anything to show for it . Now Im getting fustrated so I swithed to the dipsy.  At this point it was starting rain and I knew I didnt have that much time.  3 times within 20 minutes my dipsies surfaced without them being in the released position very odd.After that I bee lined it for shore, and made it back in the nick of time.  Saturdays outing was much nicer in the same area.I launched out of a different port with more to see, scenery wise . For that day I marked fish all around me and my lines only triggered twice, and nothing to show for I realized that I was trolling too deep for the hungry fish and my lure colours were off just a tad.  For my third day, with my lessons learned and a new one to be presented within minutes of trolling I set up a little further out from the early season spot, no fish marked but what the heck 10 minutes into trolling I had a shacker on and self released I continued on, still not marking anything . Within minutes I hear zing and zing again A double header I took the closest rod and fought that fish while I loosened the drag on the other rod. Thank god! The fish released itself but decided to do the mambo with the other one I was still fighting, ouch, talk about a birds nest a the tip of my rod. Cutting away and hoping not to loose the fish, I cut the wrong line I quickly tied it back up and finally landed it 12lb female chinny. Okay now im excited, so off I go again trolling the same area my line goes off again and this ones a monster A 10 minute battle lost at the side of the boat MILLER, were your ears ringing?"

591327,vinnimon,2011-06-09 09:36:00,2593,"I did fail to mention that on monday, there was a call out on channel 16. I listened in to see if the issue was in my area, but it was out of bronte. A small 16ft vessel reported floating around with no one aboard. Thankfully it was only a stolen boat left out to drift. Kudos to the coast gaurd with their response time With 10 to 15 minutes they fly past me. I could surely use a boat that goes that fast  "
