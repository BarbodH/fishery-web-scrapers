590028,ehg,2011-06-05 22:39:00,2666,Nice muskies there! You could catch a huge one there. Even the big ones will hit a bucktail or musky spinnerbait.  Thanks for pictures.
590031,Handlebarz,2011-06-05 22:56:00,3790,Nice going sounds like a great time not much better then that getting out fishing and handing over the cash. Now for next time yours to take back.
590034,lew,2011-06-05 23:20:00,12766,It's always fun to get a bunch of buds together for a little friendly tourney to keep things interesting. We've done it a few times too and it makes for a great weekend.
590082,splashhopper,2011-06-06 01:45:00,2931,fishing with buddies is fun.....
590119,mike rousseau,2011-06-06 03:16:00,4661,I found the tournament aspect of the day helped to give us the drive to fish hard...  On musky opener you need all the help your body can get... Casting half pound lures all day (6am-10pm) and bouncing in waves coming off a 30 foot cruiser takes it's toll on the body...  I shoulda hit the gym this winter... Shoulder is a bit tender today...
590232,Leecher,2011-06-06 14:49:00,7832,Great start to the season Mike Always nice to be able to boat a few on opener Thanks for sharing Leechman
590236,Homer Is King,2011-06-06 14:53:00,305,"The ""friendly"" fishing tournaments are the best! Always a good time, the bragging rights are worth way more than the money!!!  Contrats on a good opener."
590268,JoshS,2011-06-06 16:34:00,729,Looks like a good time... A friendly tourny among friends is always a fun way to spice things up and keep people fishing hard!
