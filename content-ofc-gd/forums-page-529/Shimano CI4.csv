I keep hearing/seeing/reading about people looking for a Ci4 and I found one but not sure if it's a good deal. http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-sports-bikes-SHIMANO-CI4-MODEL-2500-SPINNING-REEL-W0QQAdIdZ286985916  I'm not looking for one myself at this time so this is just to let you know for those looking.  No, it's not my ad either."

590729,salmon,2011-06-07 22:32:00,334,"I tried the 2500 series reel with 20lb sufix 832, I was really impressed with it. That is a good price, I like the Foam handle on the reel, I think it is better than the T shape handle."
590769,Mike01,2011-06-08 00:09:00,378,"That is a great price, they retail for over $200. I have one, it's handled everything from smallies to redfish and is still going strong."
