This baby came to play, cpr, and then we kept a few for the smoker.          Bite was short and sweet but the sun came out and gave us a licking, we were chased off by intense heat...    Great day  The new toy!!  What a machine....all that work on the transom repair was well worth it.  "

Well done. Now your boat will be even easier to spot on the Ottawa on opening day.  Game plan, follow new Rude E-Tec"
