589425,trapshooter,2011-06-03 13:13:00,1234,"Have a day off the water here and thought I'd get up a quick report from the spring fishing so far.  After the ice goes out here I have one thing on my mind.... lake trout!  Followed the ice off the lake and were catching fish right away.      Caught that fish trolling a 4"" white tube jig.  Learned that trick from the guy in the background of the picture, an old-time local guide.  Believe it or not, a tube jig trolls straight as an arrow and mimics a swimming smelt / ciscoe.  1oz with 100' out was getting down 15'.  To change things up we did some bushwhacking into a stocked splake lake.  The action was fast with fish on my first 2 casts.  I was chuckin' a in-line spinner and the other guys were getting them on slip-bobbers.      Back on the lake trout hunt....        and a real fatty for my buddy Brandon    Walleye fishing has been great since the season opened on May 21st.  The spawn was over by then and the fish were scattered.  Been getting them pitching jigs to shore in 2 feet of water and as deep as 20-feet vertical jigging.  They are on the move, transitioning along mainland shorelines between spawning areas and their summer haunts.          Looking ahead, muskie opener (June 18th) can't come soon enough!!  Got a nice package in the mail from MikeP with some of his handlebarz dbl 10's.  They look awesome and I can't wait to start chuckin' some big baits!"
589428,johnnyb,2011-06-03 13:18:00,3413,"WOW!!!  Beautiful fish, as usual! Trolling tubes, eh?  Eeeeenteresting   What kind of line were you using for that?  Thanks for keeping us posted....always love reading your reports."
589433,Basskicker,2011-06-03 13:30:00,421,Some fine looking specimens for sure!!!  I only have another 20+ years until I retire up that way.  Cheers  Jason
589435,Nipfisher,2011-06-03 13:45:00,2449,Excellent report as always Ben. Also a great Walleye article in that magazine I'm not supposed to mention on here.
589436,Homer Is King,2011-06-03 13:48:00,305,Great report! Those are some beauty fish! You're a lucky man. Thanks for sharing your story and what's working for you.
589441,solopaddler,2011-06-03 14:08:00,8605,"Awesome fish Ben. Just curious, how do you like the Frabill suit? I've been considering one myself."
589448,trapshooter,2011-06-03 14:21:00,1234,"Thanks guys.  Johnnyb - good old mono, 12 lb, with a swivel 3' up the line.  Solo - love the Frabill suit!  Awesome features, dry and very comfortable to wear."
589457,g_clot,2011-06-03 14:41:00,104,What a blast I had just reading and looking.  I love Ontario!
589474,Leecher,2011-06-03 15:24:00,7832,Excellent Ben White tube is killer for lakers and whities Another killer lure for lakers is a Black Furry #5 Thanks for sharing Leechman
589507,corvette1,2011-06-03 17:54:00,1765,nice lakers and eyes that one is a fattie
589509,solopaddler,2011-06-03 17:57:00,8605, Didn't you wear the BPS 100MPH suit before? How does it compare?
589549,trapshooter,2011-06-03 19:10:00,1234," I still have the BPS Bibs (and Simms coat) and they are a good combo.  The Frabill suit has more features and better hood/cuffs, pockets, pliers holder etc.  It seems bullet proof so far and I've got it pretty wet already."
589556,Jds63,2011-06-03 19:19:00,1365,"Awesome, Ben ... fantastic photos  I wish I was up there in God's country"
589562,Handlebarz,2011-06-03 19:30:00,3790,Dang that Laker fishing sure does make me drool its has been way to long since I had one of them on a line.  Excellent report as always Ben.  Glad the package got there before the strike  We will be out chasing the toothy critters tomorrow.
589564,adempsey,2011-06-03 19:30:00,1498,Lucky dogs!  Nice fish!  I'd be smiling like the Joker if I had a day like that.
589596,beginner,2011-06-03 21:14:00,542,amazing pic... those fish are monsters...  wicked!...

590186,fishindevil,2011-06-06 12:48:00,6254,awesome fishing ben !!! some very nice lakers & eyes man !!  cheers
591292,trapshooter,2011-06-09 02:38:00,1234,"Thanks gang!  With walleye season going strong and muskie just around the corner I think my days of chasing big lakers on Minnitaki are over until fall.  Was a lot of fun while it lasted though.  They are definitely a lot of fun, esp those big ones.  There's another lake nearby where we jig in the summer 50-80 FOW but the fish run a lot smaller.  It's easy to catch 20-30 a day but most are 2-7lbs.  Heading up lac seul again tomorrow after an absolute blow-out/cold/wet day today.  We'll see how the fish are biting post-front."
591426,Bob Devine,2011-06-09 18:03:00,251,Good stuff Ben !
591428,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-09 18:12:00,0,Nice shootin Ben. Have fun with your next season opener.
