However the exam/test should be a one time deal if 100 bucks. Or if 20 ish then every year as long as its not 20 + 40 for license (then that is stupid).

Perhaps next we can force people to write an exam before we're allowed to walk down the sidewalk to prevent some poor soul from stepping out in front of a bus.  We write an exam to drive a car yet it doesn't stop carnage on our hiways, we write an exam to drive a boat yet people drown in foolish accidents every weekend. We write an exam to carry a gun yet every November some hunter is killed because a license holder thought he was a deer.  You could have people writing fishing exams till the cows come home but if somebody wants to fish a sanctuary, keep OOS bass or eat a 30"" musky, all the testing in the world ain't gonna stop it.  We're already over licensed, over tested, over taxed and over yada yada yada in this province as it is and we sure as heck don't need any more of it.  Last fall I thought it would be a good idea to have a VHF in my boat so I could maybe call for assistance if I was in trouble or go the aid of another boater who needed help. That simple little safety feature in my boat cost me 85 hard earned $$$$ and a full Saturday.

Obviously if someone has an intention to break the law, they're going to do it. With the current system, it's ""pay for a license, and here are some rules but they're kinda over there and you should really have a look at them."" I've read on this board of COs issuing warnings instead of fines. There would be no need for warnings if having a look through the book was mandatory, as you were consciously breaking the law.  I also don't see how someone could afford fishing equipment and tackle but couldn't afford a $XX test, but even then I made no mention of it costing anything (although a small price is not avoidable)."

Unfortunately around here, alot of those people fishing from shore that keep everything, are status natives and can legally keep them fish. Even though I'm sure he had no idea how to prepare his ""lake trout""  That being said, I think anglers should follow good moral practices and worry more about how they treat the resource. If every responsible angler takes good measures to protect the fish, that's a healthy start.  The problems that arise from new licensing practices etc usually don't work out to be any better than things are currently, and often times makes things worse.  One thing I despise about society today is the blatant over complication on everyday things. And complicating this and that just compiles new issues.  Just my two cents..."
590241,Harrison,2011-06-06 15:03:00,2202,Forget about the testing.  I think we should have a program where all rods must be registered.  This way the police would know in advance when rolling up on a residence there could possibly be criminal activity and to check the freezer.
590242,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 15:05:00,11391,"This might sound like a horrible idea, but maybe on larger bodies of water and at public access landing, there should be shacks, employing summer students or the likes, where anglers are required to check their catch before leaving the lake/river etc. This could be employed by a government agency in certain places, and maybe by resort/landing owners etc in other locations. Insentives could be given to those that choose to employ this method? Things like that might help  We all know there can't be enough CO's on the water to stop over fishing or illegal fishing practices"

590272,ckrb2007,2011-06-06 16:49:00,449,"Absolutely not. That's why they have the regs in plain print and online and in several different languages. Do I know EVERY single species, slot sizes, limits and seasons out there?? Definitely not, but I do know all the particulars for the body or water, area and species that I will be fishing for at any given time. I strongly agree with many people on here who said the penalties should be far more severe then they are........and that comes down to an enforcement issue, not only from the CO's, but from the courts as well. In my opinion, the only reasons for not ""obeying"" the law is pure ignorance and complete disregard FOR the law(s)."
590286,Garry2Rs,2011-06-06 17:24:00,1425,"Why is it that those who have a licence to do something always want to make it harder for everyone else to get one too?  We weren't born smart, we learned by trail and error.  Lighten-up on the newbies, most of them are voters and we need them on our side if we want the government to listen to us.  I read that for the last 20 years or more, in North America, there have been less fishing licences sold each year.  The fact is the Game-Boy and Play Station crowd don't know anything about fishing and have little or no interest.  I think a large part of the problem is the cost.  If a guy recalls the fun he had as a kid fishing, and wants to take the kids out on Saturday morning, he has to buy $20-$30 worth of paper before he can go to the conservation area...Want to bet he opts for a Disney movie instead?  If we want the government to spend money on fish related issues, we need more voters involved.  Therefore, we need to make it easier for folks to go fishing, not make it harder.  As for the bucket brigade, we all started somewhere! Personally, I think these folks do more to improve the fishing than to hurt it.  Who really cares about a couple of OOS bass when they are taking hundreds of hungry pan-fish out of the lake every weekend?  What about doing a way with the fishing licence all together?  Some of you must be old enough to remember that back in about 1973 Premier Bill Davis scrapped the Ontario Resident fishing licence, calling it a nuisance tax.  As I recall the cost of printing and selling licences ate all the revenue.  Today, in my area, it's hard to buy a fishing licence.  Many small places say there are too many headaches involved and it isn't worth their time."
590293,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 17:34:00,11391," Lots of good points there, and I agree on alot of them.  No offence to anyone, but I find the OOS bass and nesting issue quite ridiculous, and mainly for the simple fact that only one part of a large chain is being discussed.  Big fish, small fish etc all forage on eggs, minnows etc, thats nature. If I made the same argument for crawfish, I'd be laughed at, yet, it is the EXACT same thing.  One thing to ponder specifically for bass, is that although many target them, how many anglers actually keep bass to eat? I'd be willing to bet not many, at least not frequently. Now reverse that with walleye. Seems the populations are fine, even though these fish are kept much more frequently than bass, correct?  Should I also target pike mainly to keep another fishes populations ""under control"", in a completely non scientific aspect? The fact is, there probably isn't one of us on this board that actually knows these things about a certain body of water. It's all speculation, all of it.  If I keep a female walleye tomorrow, that alot of eggs that won't get made next year, correct? It's really not the case at all.  Seem to me that an argument, whether right or wrong, needs to take all species into account to make a sound decision."

590319,Rod Caster,2011-06-06 18:22:00,5784,More enforcement. OPP should enforce fishing laws (or do they already) and designated lake/area watchdogs should be allowed to lay fines with photo/witness evidence. There are not enough CO's and they need help.

Campers should have to take a class in woodcraft, and all should have basic first aid before being allowed loose in the great outdoors. I mean, really folks!

A fishing licience is the only licience that I can think of that anyone can buy regardless of knowledge. AS for children fishing.The current system does not allow them to fish without being in the presence of a leagal adult with a fishing licience.  If we as schooled anglers have trouble inturpreting the regs how can we expect some one that cant tell the difference between a sunfish and a bass to act responsably?

Today, the destruction of freshwater fisheries is the result of habitat loss from things like damns, pollution and invasive species.  I don't think the average ""uneducated"" weekend warrior has much impact.  Ultimately, having to take a test would make little difference to me personally; but much like everything else the government does, I am sure it would raise the cost of obtaining a license substantially.  That money wouldn't be going back to conservation either.  It would be going to all the extra employees required for managing the testing program."

590121,crossover,2011-06-06 03:18:00,172,"Let's say before applying for your first time, you would need to take a test, and a passing grade would requiret at least 75%. The answers would all be found in the most recent version of the regs (however it is obviously not an open book test). The questions would not be region specific (such as what is the slot size for walleye on lake X) but rather questions every angler should know, such as the minimum distance fishing downstream of a dam. The reason for this test is that when it comes to certain fishermen not playing by the rules, the top excuse seems to be that they didn't know and that we need to spend more money on education. With a test, less money would go toward education and more toward enforcement. Even those new to the sport would perhaps learn something important. As I said, the test would only be a one time thing."

590138,timmeh,2011-06-06 03:57:00,609,"I agree there should be a test. But i think it should be an open book test. If it's not open book you can only ask basic questions, and people would only need to review the first few pages. The point of the test would not be to fail people, but rather to make sure they're aware the regs exist in the first place and to understand what type of info they contain and how to look it up. That way you can ask specific questions as to the slot size for fish X in lake X. With an open copy of the regs anyone should be able to find this, and it would ensure new anglers would not only learn the basic regs but learn how to look up the more complex regs correctly. Plus with a test no one would have any excuse for not knowing the regs, so I would like to see increased fines for those caught breaking them.  With the push to create a better website and get people to purchase/renew online, they could easily insert a multiple choice test the first time you purchase a license. The fee would be very small and a one time thing.  However all this being said i'm not sure how many problems it would solve. The real problem is that similar presentations catch many different species, and in many cases you can't prove the angler was targeting the out of season fish and not the in season one. It all comes down to intent and that's impossible to prove sometimes."

I'm a pretty staunch conservationist, but am getting tired of the ""elitist"" tone some of these posts are taking.

Costs should be low as well like with the PWC test, 40.00 seems to work for that, sometimes you can get a discount as well (unless that changed too!).  I'm sure any of us could come up with 36 basic fishing questions covered by the free copy of the regs, may it's time the government listened as well.  20.00 should be ample for this considering that, unlike the PWC, fishing is an annual fee not a lifetime. One last point I noticed mentioned in general - it should be MANDATORY for any offeneder to do an IN DEPTH testing before having a license restored, and only ONE chance given.  Re-offend and yer off the water for LIFE!  Michael"

590160,Roy,2011-06-06 10:28:00,13728,This is a very slippery slope.
590170,Grimace,2011-06-06 11:31:00,2020,No more fake knowledge please.  I do not think the problem is ignorance or lack of awareness.   The problem is people are knowingly breaking the law.   Let's bust their arses.
590195,Live2fish85,2011-06-06 13:17:00,1633,I don't think that they need to do a test for the fishing license but I think that there should be more of a test for your boat license. I seen some guys out at lake erie last night that didn't have a clue what he was doing plus my buddy is the same lol but he's learning. I also think that a lot of it is ignorance and people just don't care or think anything will happen to them a few weeks back some moron was going full throttle and didn't know the water we are in a bay where either side of the bay is a rock point that goes out alot farther then the eye and waters really high and he went flying full out and smashed the motor off the point thank god they were all ok but as for the boat it was a write off. The Government won't change the fishing license as it gives them lots of money but The boat exams a different story.
590200,skinny,2011-06-06 13:35:00,442,how about a madatory course to take before getting a fishing ticket and the course could be put on by a local club or org that really cares about the fish. then after the course you recieve a paper to submit for you card or something  kinda like the turkey thing (Idon't know much about this I don't hunt just know there is a course to take)
590204,bushart,2011-06-06 13:50:00,2628,How about we approach a company like Plano or Woodstream  Get them to make a tackle box that when your dun fishin you scan your stringer/livewell or bucket and if you've broke the rules.....  A wooden mallett comes outta the tacklebox and gives ya one upside the noodle  Ala Acme tools and the coyote..
590214,Sinker,2011-06-06 14:20:00,8692,"You guys are all nuts if you think a test is required to go fishing!!!!!  What about first timers, and kids, or joe blow who wants to cast off the dock once in a while. Good lord, your going to make it impossible to cast a line!!  The problem in ENFORCEMENT!! There is almost NONE!! I haven't been checked by a CO for years, and I spend a lot of time on the water!!!  S."
590229,Cookslav,2011-06-06 14:42:00,1457,"   Couldn't have said it better myself. A course does little to disuade people from breaking the rules, enforcement is where we'll make a difference."
590233,OhioFisherman,2011-06-06 14:51:00,6623,"They hand out fishing regulations or have then for free for those that need them on the counter of most places I have bought a license some people never take one or open it up.  Fishing at an area pond I had a dude walk up to me and show me the Rainbow trout he had caught, they were sunfish.  On vacation at the Georgian Bay one time and a couple guys show me and my buddy the huge Largemouth bass they had caught and asked if it was good to eat, Ya go for it! It was a bowfin.  At local lakes here I have seen people fishing from shore put what ever they catch in their bucket, "" if it`s big enough to bite? it`s big enough to eat? "" and species was no concern to them.  A former friend of my dad`s tried to come back here one time with 27 northern pike between him and his friend, he got busted and whined about it, we laughed at him.  With the increase in population in a lot of areas the fishery becomes more fragile, some one needs to do something to protect it?  Perhaps warning signs? "" a fishing rod is not a license to be stupid ""."
