591074,scugpg,2011-06-08 18:04:00,1373,I was dismantling my antenna the other day and the wire has broken off from inside. Do you guys think this can be fixed or am I stuck getting another one?

If you have the space, get a ratchet mount and an 8 foot fiberglass antenna.  Durham Radio in Whitby has all the stuff you need.  I suppose you could take the broken antenna to them and ask for a fix."

591397,dannyboy,2011-06-09 14:59:00,367,Radioworld is a good place to start - going from an 8' to a 3' antenna is going to cut the range by about 40%. Also VHF is line of sight so the higher the antenna is placed the better going from 5' to 10' above the water can give you another 30% range if you have the power.  Dan
