590740,justwannafish,2011-06-07 23:03:00,82,"I'm thinking of doing a camping trip north of Gravenhurst to a little piece of water near Weirs Bay. I'm just wondering if anyone here has any info on that particular area such as road access (I would be taking Orimat Rd) and what condition it's in (I drive a Chevy Cobalt so offroading is not an option), camping availability, and things of that nature. The island I'm thinking of boating out to to camp on is the one big one by ""McDonald's Cut"".  Here's a link to the google map image of where I'm thinking of heading...  http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Weirs+Bay,+Gravenhurst,+Ontario&aq=0&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=55.144899,135.263672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Weirs+Bay&ll=44.848339,-79.481771&spn=0.014696,0.033023&t=h&z=16   Any help would be great!  Thanks very much!  Josh"
