Awesome storm"
591302,Sinker,2011-06-09 03:02:00,8692,"I took shelter from one at about 2:45, then headed back out on the water, only to be chased off by an even bigger, mother of a storm. Holy moly, did it ever come fast. Barely made it to shore. Got soaked loading the boat. Raindrops like marbles, and howling wind. I wish I coulda took pictures on the boat ride in. I haven't seen the sky do what it did before. Crazy stuff!  S."
591308,Tdel,2011-06-09 03:19:00,393,"Storm came through Penetanguishene and Midland this evening.  The wind and rain was incredible, with lots of lightning and thunder. Lots of trees down in Midland and Penetanguishene area. Power out from approx 5:50pm to 10:45pm. Thought for sure there would have been a tornado in the area because the wind and rain here was worse than the wind we had when the tornado went through Midland last year. The roads were covered with small branches and leaves. All I can say is ""Wow"" and it is probably the closest I will come to feeling the effects of a tornado until the real thing happens, God forbid. (not the destruction but the wind and rain)  Tom"
