586737,BiggFish,2011-05-26 03:08:00,40,"Hey SBK,  I planned on entering and received an entry form as I am a Burford Lions member. After receiving the entry form and reading it 10 times I could not find the date of the event on the forum. Would likely help if the date was on the registration forms.  Where can I get some info on this event?  Chad  "
586795,jediangler,2011-05-26 12:39:00,1923,Let us know how it went spinnerbaitking. I would like to know what the size of the winning fish was. There is a kayakfishing derby on Belwood on June 11/11. Info on that derby can be found at Yakfisher.net.
586931,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-26 19:17:00,1622,"Everything you need to know is on this link I think, but where to find the big fish only I know were that is lol I hope:Gonefishing: SBK http://www.belwoodlions.org/PikeDerby.html"
587001,jediangler,2011-05-26 22:18:00,1923,"WOW! Only 7 pike over 24"" long caught by 509 anglers over two days last year. I think they might be missing all the pike that they used to transport from Orangeville's derbies. They stopped the Orangeville derbies due to pressure on nesting bass."
587013,Cookslav,2011-05-26 22:30:00,1457,"I have a trailer on the lake and I can safely say that Derby has been a Gong show for the last few years LOL...  I used to fish it with my Dad as a kid but I can't hack the traffic anymore. There Seems to be a lot more weekend warriors with out etiqutte, or manners joining in the fun. But for a decent cause I suppose the more people the merrier right?...I just don't enjoy the crowds. Either I'm getting old, or I just attract   's  I used to see lots of kids, and few serious anglers but in years past its been powerboats weaving around Canoes at full tilt, and honestly.....just a LOT of disrespectfull punks.  I'll wait for another 2 weeks to wet a line"
587021,mattp33,2011-05-26 22:56:00,290,"Has anyone even been out to the lake this year?  When I drove over the bridge it did not look like you will get even a bass boat under the bridge.  It has been a really wet spring and that lake is up so high its going to be tough.  I fished it 2 years ago and I had to remove the windshield just to get my old 16 ft sylvan under the bridge and up river.  Good Luck tho guys!  I wish I had the time to fish it  It is a good cause, so lets get out and do our part!"
587023,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-26 23:03:00,1622,"We are hoping to hook a few of the followers this year, usually find some nice ones just can't get them to bite & I'm not into live bait, I started going there in the late 80's fishing out of a canoe, I've had problem's with Jet Skiers in the past but nothing a Daredevil past the ear doesn't fix lol, we usually see the OPP & a CO out checking boats for Safety Equipment, Outdoor Card, Booze etc. SBK"
587024,bigugli,2011-05-26 23:05:00,6138,"Last time I fished the derby, it was also a high water year and a late season. Most of the top fish were caught along the edges in the submerged brush."
588019,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-30 10:38:00,1622,"WHEN WE HEADED HOME SATURDAY AT 7:30PM THERE WAS ONLY 1 24"" PIKE ENTERED IN THE DERBY, only 3 Pike entered & some one said over 400 fisherman, a 30+"" was second & a 36+"" was 1st, there were no kids entered so they made a draw, we had 7 under 22"" Saturday & 3 under 22"" on Sunday plus a catfish,2 Smallies & 1 Walleye, toughest fishing I've had on Belwood, but it was a good fund raiser for the Lion's SBK  "
588035,Cookslav,2011-05-30 12:06:00,1457,"36"" is a decent fish for a change atleast, and it sounds like you got into a few to keep you occupied.  Belwood is a very tricky lake most of the time....especially when 400 boats are cruising her LOL! But good one ya for getting out and supporting the derby"
588136,johnnyb,2011-05-30 17:49:00,3413,"Wow, that's a lot of boats!  Good on you for getting out...definitely a good cause...and you caught a few fish"
588377,jediangler,2011-05-31 05:26:00,1923,Thanks for the update spinnerbaitking.  The Yakfishers won't hit the lake until June 11th.  I'll post here how they did in comparison.
588379,Handlebarz,2011-05-31 09:01:00,3790,Thats kinda shocking that there were not any kids out. And that bad day of fishing sure beat sitting at home covered in Poison Ivy.
588389,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-31 10:24:00,1622," There were kids there but they didn't catch a legal Pike 24"" minimum SBK"
