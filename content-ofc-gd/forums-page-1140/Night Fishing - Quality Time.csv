He wanted to try out his new Little Cloe (glow) that he got for his birthday. His birthday was on Sept 28 and I was hoping to get him out night fishing with his new lure but he was pretty worn out from his party and excitement of the day so we didn't go.  I showed him how to light it with the flashlight, still trying to get a blacklight, and how to retrieve it. He usually uses a bobber so retrieving it was different for him. But he caught on pretty quickly. But you know kids, if they aren't catching then they don't stay put. He changed up his set-up for a hook,worm and bobber. Nothing that way so he tried one of my spinner baits and nothing also. So he put down the rod and just started playing. Atleast he didn't get skunked at Lake Scugog earlier today, he caught a tiny Perch. So not all was a loss.  After we were done we went to Timmy's and we each got a donut and we just chatted about kid stuff. He's excited to be 6yrs old now.  He said that he wants to get out at night again so I told him maybe we'll try next weekend.  Well that's it from us, sorry no pics but no fish to get pics of."
