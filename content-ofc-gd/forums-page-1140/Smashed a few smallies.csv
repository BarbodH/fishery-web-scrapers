119409,mart,2007-10-01 12:53:00,93,"Brian, Thanks for the gps co-ordinates!!!!   Makes my pre fishing easier for The Open...just kidding. Good to see you had a great time out there and got into some nice fish!!!  I also had cranking battery issues this weekend. My son was in the boat the day before and turned on my navigation switch and it drained my battery.  Lesson learned.."
119412,steverowbotham,2007-10-01 12:59:00,1800,"nicely done Brian, keep those north end spots a secret"
119418,misfish,2007-10-01 13:18:00,29133,"  Marcel,mine was leaving the livewell pump on,last year was the nav light switch.  Steve the north is safe,I say nothing about the good spots.LOL"
119423,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-01 13:45:00,0,Very Impressive fish and in a short period of time. Do they fight as well this time of year as in the summer? In the summer they fought to the death!! I had to revive every single fish...
119442,OhioFisherman,2007-10-01 14:12:00,6623,Bass is beautiful! Nice fesh Brian! Dang you sound Canadian in the video.
119479,wuchikubo,2007-10-01 15:10:00,1114,WTG Brian on the nice hawgs.
119494,misfish,2007-10-01 15:40:00,29133," Johnny Im going to say they fight just as hard,but have a pound extra on them.LOL The live well helps with recooping them. All fish were brought in slow.I kept the rod tip down deep as possible to prevent jumps. I also when back to straight p-line florclear. No PP backing.   Thats funny,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I thought I sounded like I was still drunk from the night before.LOL   HICUP."
119495,Seaweed,2007-10-01 15:42:00,135,Nice Haul for sure... gotta love those smallies
119499,steverowbotham,2007-10-01 15:55:00,1800,Good to hear they are safe Brian.
119575,misfish,2007-10-01 19:00:00,29133,Lets hope they work at the BBM event.
119588,bucktail,2007-10-01 19:26:00,1857,Awesome fish Brian.  What does that beast on the right hand side go...looks like a striped carp!
119593,misfish,2007-10-01 19:34:00,29133," Carp????????????????LOL  I didnt have a scale. I,ll be picking one up this weekend so I know EXACTLY what I have. Im sure it was 5+. I have caught so many small fish this year 2,s and 3,s,they all  looked like 7,s coming to the boat. L M A O    Thanks bud."
119133,misfish,2007-09-30 16:34:00,29133,"With a party the night before it was a late start to the morning.The mrs,s stayed home to sleep so I headed off alone.It was even a later start when I had to change a dead cranking battery. So by 8 ish I was on my spot and I had no idea today was going to be as sweet as it was. After reading a few reports of the slow bite I wasnt sure what to expect.  Water temps were 63,still pretty warm I think.  I started out in 15 fow and worked a jerk bait with very limited success as I had a few foloowes but nothing big. Grabbed my go to tube and thats where it all came together. I had drifted off my spot and had some good hook marks,so I dropped the tube over the edge,hit the bottom twitch and slam,fish on. It was a good one as it held the rod down and did the reel screaming thing.  Get it to the surface and it,s a 4+ fattie.Man what a nice fish. I continued this and with in an hour and a half I had 5 fish in the well. All came on the tube. It was unbilieveable. Im guessing in had over 20+ and thats a personal best for me.            Heres the vid to comfirm what Im holding.  "

119352,misfish,2007-10-01 09:38:00,29133,"  Silly me,what was I thinking Mark.LOL   I think that one I said was a three was more like 4,.Thats the single one,they were so fat.  Thanks again all."
119407,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:51:00,7971,Wow...those are great smallies!  Sounded like they had some good fight in them too.  The video was a nice touch.  I've enjoyed all your bass reports this year....so much so that I actually went out to target them a few times with fellow OFNers.
