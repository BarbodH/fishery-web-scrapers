118821,solopaddler,2007-09-29 11:28:00,8605,This link is invaluable. Once you've gone a couple of times and have a yardstick to measure the flow rates against you'll pretty much know what the water levels will be like.... http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp
118917,FishFinder,2007-09-29 20:35:00,481,"super low and clear, best bet is to go out east"

119088,Rich Clemens,2007-09-30 13:24:00,3131,"Water levels on the French are down, maybe a coupel feet.   I understand they are to be opening the dams in the next week or two, so the levels will rise.  The owner of Wolseley Lodge told us that.  Sounds like they do this each fall to lower Nipissing a little in preparation for the spring thaw.  (MY guess anyway)"
