119086,bigfish1965,2007-09-30 13:21:00,3382,We'll leave this one up and lock it..it is valuable information and anglers need to know they are being targetted. It appears most attacks are directed at Asian anglers. Be careful out there. Call the police right away if anything happens. Let's get these punks in jail where they belong. I would only say that counter to what the Asian community seems to be saying...please do talk to us Caucasian anglers. Say Hi and strike up a conversation if you can. We automatically accept you as part of the community of anglers and will do what we can to protect you. We are all anglers and we must help one another. Who wouldn't want a nice plate of tasty crappie filets right about now???
