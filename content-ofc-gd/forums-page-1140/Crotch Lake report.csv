We had neighbours that were kind enough to give me a feed of Bass....Yummy, and more importantly some very good memories. The lake is spectacular, both in scenery and in fishability. I do not have the skills, yet, but that will come with practice and experience. As an added bonus, I did learn more about what i want to get when I do finally make my boat purchase. Live well for sure and rod holders."
