BIG congrats to Greg Klatt and partner 13 plus pounds. OLDPHART also took BIG PERCH money...beat me by a crawfish or two.  Thanks to SLYATV for getting someone out of a dead sleep with 20 minutes before takeoff and into my boat with 10 seconds to spare. Greg was a hoot to fish with.  Don from ICEGUIDEZ and Rock Madsen (MR.FISH CRISP) must be THANKED LARGE for putting on an event that paid 100% back to the guys!!  All keep fish caught on  drop shot GULP 3 inch shiners out of 45-60 feet of water."

119367,ranger520vx,2007-10-01 11:21:00,164,Congrats ICEDUDE...didn't realize that was you. I think there is an opportunity for name tags with these handles we start to get known by to be worn at these type of events. Keep in touch.  Mark
