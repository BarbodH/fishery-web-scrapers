I used the HTML tag here and switched the post to HTML ON with auto linebreak mode and it seems to play in frame here:    <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i186.photobucket.com/remix/player.swf?videoURL=http%3A%2F%2Fvid186.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fx276%2FIceguy_2007%2F6dbd13ab.pbr&hostname=stream186.photobucket.com""></embed>  "

119403,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:47:00,7971,"Wow...that's a great video!!!  I always think I should do that, but then when there's a fish on I always forget...LOL.  Most of my fishing is at night, so video would kinda suck, but on those odd days I fish during the day, it's the furthest thing from my mind.  Great job and great muskie!"
