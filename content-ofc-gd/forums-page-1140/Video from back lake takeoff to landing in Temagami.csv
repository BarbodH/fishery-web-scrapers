118762,irishfield,2007-09-29 02:50:00,26272,"Took 5 x three minute videos after I caught that 38"" pike on a back lake...just so you can see how close to home I really was by air....yet air access only (or a LOT of bush wacking!). First video is 3 minutes taxi on the water. Next 4 are the take off and scenery on the way home plus the landing and to the dock. Exactly 12 minutes take off to shut down. A bit blurry and you may want to turn your sound right down. Best I could do with my A570IS ram mounted to my open door frame for the flight. Gives a nice idea of how many lakes are just off to the side of the main ""big"" lake.  You may need to right click...save as is...and play that way. Not sure how each computer system will process these.  Dial up...don't even try...they are 17 to 18 MEG each.  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Floatvideo%20001.avi  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Floatvideo%20002.avi  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Floatvideo%20003.avi  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Floatvideo%20004.avi  http://www.irishfield.on.ca/gallery/Floatvideo%20005.avi"
118769,Tomcat,2007-09-29 03:10:00,395,Thanks for sharing your exploits during the summer as well as these latest videos. Great stuff!!
118770,irishfield,2007-09-29 03:11:00,26272,Did they play alright for you Tomcat?
118775,Tomcat,2007-09-29 03:19:00,395,"Although I posted while downloading the last video, it played fine as did the first two videos I downloaded. My download speeds are a bit slow even though I have high speed sympatico (I'm at the outer distance limitation). Well worth the wait though! Thanks again."
118785,irishfield,2007-09-29 03:40:00,26272,Good to hear. I have to right click and save as...even though it's on our own server!
118788,SlowPoke,2007-09-29 03:45:00,2984,Nice video Wayne. It didn't play properly in a window but it worked fine when I saved it. You have a great ground crew. A striking resemblance to your First Mate on the HMS Baron! -Brian
118800,mrpike,2007-09-29 04:52:00,151,Very nice.  Play here just fine .  hope you had a great summer and your winter goes well also. Hope to see you at lakair next spring for the big EVENT. I think I will book the last week of JUNE next spring .
118839,bigfish1965,2007-09-29 13:42:00,3382,Wayne.. If you save them as WMV files and compress them a bit they'll hurt your bandwidth less. Then you can use Embed codes and they will display here.. The easies thing to do however is put them up on YouTube and they will give you the embed code to copy/paste.
118842,irishfield,2007-09-29 13:49:00,26272,Thank Rick.
118855,douG,2007-09-29 15:00:00,2693,Wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!

119063,Roy,2007-09-30 11:42:00,13728,"Good stuff Wayne. Each clip took about 45 seconds to D/L here. Last shot on the last clip..famous last words...""She ain't gunna go anywhere."" hahahahaha  You're probably on your way here now so, drive safely.....there are obstacles when travelling on the ground. See you then."
119064,irishfield,2007-09-30 11:46:00,26272,"Last word when the video dies...""boards"".  Off in 5 Roy !"
