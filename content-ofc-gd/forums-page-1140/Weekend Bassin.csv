119391,Seaweed,2007-10-01 12:25:00,135,Well I finally got my brother out on the boat on the weekend.  We decided to hit a close northern lake in hopes of finding some nice fish.  We hit the jackpot fishing this beautiful spot that isn't that far from the city.  It is a lake on the Fish-Hawk Lakes project site ... can anyone figure out where we were? This is only my third time I have used advice from the site but with the results we had I think I will check out a few others and maybe contribute some info on how we do.  We decided to try some rock ledge area first and were rewarded with some small hammerhandle pike and a couple of tiny smallmouth.  The scenery was grand though so we just kept fishing the lakeside.  Towards lunch time I decided that we were going to head off to the other shallow end of the lake and try for some Largemouth.  Man what a great move.  I was into one not two minutes after we arrived and the action was not constant but once we figured out what they really wanted we started boating some nice fish.
