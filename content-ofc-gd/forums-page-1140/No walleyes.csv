She put up a good fight and then I told my mom to grab the walleye net and the fish decided to bust loose and tare my net appart, lol, I had my arm and rod through the hole in the net with the net on my shoulder and somehow managed to land it, 42"" and healthy released to assassinate another fisherman's net in the future.

119399,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:42:00,7971,You are right!  Going for walleye and getting a great pike!  Good job!

119445,OhioFisherman,2007-10-01 14:16:00,6623,LOL walleye are over rated! Nice pike! Something looks familier about that place.

119466,lew,2007-10-01 14:46:00,12767,Great stuff GbG!!  It's always good when the incidental catch is 4 times as big as the intended target
119468,Squid,2007-10-01 14:50:00,1656,Now that is a nice Pike.
119469,mattyk,2007-10-01 14:53:00,2110,nice pike!
119511,GbayGiant,2007-10-01 16:52:00,1780,"Thanks guys.   It's funny I got a musky on the same walleye gear 2 weeks ago but no picture, it's happens a lot up here, I go musky fishing and don't get a sniff than go walleye fishing and get pike/muskies.  must be doing something wrong.  Got the Pike in super fast current in 10fow, had a 3/4 oz jig and casting up current."
119630,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-01 20:56:00,0,So thats where the monster pike hang out!!! Thanks!
