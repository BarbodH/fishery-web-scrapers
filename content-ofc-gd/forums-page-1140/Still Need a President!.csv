We have a new Vice President (Doug Gauthier), Second Vice (Paul Groves), Secretary (Bruce Downs) and Treasurer (Tom Copeland) all four were acclaimed. We have to have a President. Please attend the Oct 22nd meeting if you can and let someone know if you'd consider running.  Well a promise is a promise and Dagmar and Jerry have committed to not committing this next 2 year term. The problem with stepping in when no one else will is you come to find out just how important keeping a club like this going really is. If you can't find anyone to replace you come elections, it's just too hard to step away.  The answer for Dagmar and Jerry is obvious. JUST SAY NO! As harsh as that seems it's obvious they made the right decision. Without fresh blood and new input, volunteer organizations stagnate. Yes there is no substitute for experience and both Jerry and Dagmar have agreed to give full support to anyone who steps in.  WHO CAN RUN? If you are currently a member in good standing you can be nominated and run for a position on the executive. Currently the Bi-Law states you have to be on the executive for 2 years to run for President but Jerry our current President can and will wave that Bi-Law.  So the time has come for the few who have stood for so long to cut the thread and see where this club lands. Please attend the September 24th meeting. If you can't commit 2 years towards your favourite hobby then agree to stand for the Board of Directors. The BOD simply run errands for the executive and will allow us to gain charitable status and run a democratic club for 2 more years.  Who can nominate someone? You can nominate any member in good standing but they either must be present at the meeting or provide a letter agreeing to stand for the position before the meeting. If you yourself can't make the Sept 24th meting but are willing to stand for a position on the executive or the BOD, please provide a letter ASAP. Your time will be appreciated by the outdoors community in St Catharines and beyond."

118554,chilli,2007-09-28 16:46:00,199,"Thanks Still only 6 out of 10 board of directors nominated. I don't know why no one has stepped up for President. Easiest job in the whole joint. You just follow the meeting agenda, bang the gavel and be the figure head. Really hoping someone intelligent with both hunting and fishing under their belt steps up. They don't need either but I'd like to see this club return to it's hay day. The alternative is not acceptable.  Come on people in St Kitts. Give your city a voice!"
