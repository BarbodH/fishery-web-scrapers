He knew some spots on pigeon and I've been having some luck lately on Scugog so we decided to try Lovesick Lake   .  We pulled up a bit after nine at Sticklers resort.  No problems at all and though the 8hp motor seemed a bit week the boat was actually pretty nice (even had padded chairs ooh ahh), I'd definitely recommend them to anyone.  I'd been to lovesick once before a couple months earlier and had a couple spots I thought we should be able to find some in so off we puttered all decked out with Bitsmiths trolling motor and my fish finder hanging off the back (mental note - gotta buy me a trolling motor - made the day much nicer).  We hit the first spot on my tour of 'honey holes' and soon enough had the first fish  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1426/1465156259_74ca74a6e7_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1860"" /></a>  Hey its a start right?  Bitsmith then pulled in our first bass but it was smaller than the rockbass and got tossed back before I could get a good pic  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1321/1466011650_abac4d8784_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1861"" /></a>  He'd regret that as we soon found out we were in for one of those days as the vultures started circling  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/1466007648_b7a5125df8_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1863"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1415/1465151939_3a0e23d339_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1865"" /></a>  Eventually I got into some really good fish:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1019/1466005150_ad2b3a92df_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1866"" /></a>  And if you can believe it a real smallie!  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/1465153765/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1130/1465153765_8d1cb925f7_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1867"" /></a>  (notice the hold close to camera trick)  As the sun started to set we rolled over a spot that the finder showed covered with panfish  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1033/1465155467_20fbcbc856.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_1871"" /></a>  So off went Bithsmith to add one more species to the days list of monsters  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1350/1466009490_4b11007131_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""IMG_1869"" /></a>  We caught a few more small guys then called it a day.  Definitely not what we were looking for and never even got out the muskie gear (we were so set on finding a good bass spot we just rand out of time).  So I guess the lesson is that when you know a couple lakes and are paying good money for a rental sometimes its a good idea to actually go to those lakes you know.  Ah well, a weekend of panfish I guess is still better than a kick in  the"
119327,Greencoachdog,2007-10-01 02:27:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  A weekend of Panfish is a lot better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick!!!
119355,fatherof3,2007-10-01 10:10:00,1769,sounds like a tough outing but at least the skunk didn't show up
119400,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:44:00,7971,"Fishing is like that....can be maddening, can be great!  Count this as an in-between day...hehe.  Great pics and report as usual Tbay!"
119415,Bitsmith2k,2007-10-01 13:05:00,396, i lucked out and got the weekend of panfish and kick to the eye.. best of both worlds..
119427,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-01 13:51:00,0,"Thanks for the report. Been wanting to try lovesick for as while but the size of it(too small), deters me. Nice finder shot.I gotta buy an Eagle or lowrance. My fish finder only reads fish in 2 feet of water and thick weeds!!"
119456,tbayboy,2007-10-01 14:27:00,1497,I'm still not sure about my finder - I try to use it without the fish id but all it showed during that shot was a skinny horizontal line at both depths so I was kinda doubting the fish id but then the panfish started hitting the jigs.  We never did get much from the 10' depth ones though.  Was kinda funny outfitting the little rental with our extra trolling motor and big battery plus the finder and its battery than our 10 rods and 4 bags of gear.  Surprised we had room to stand and fish .  The lake is very small Johnny (with our 8hp motor we went end to end in 15 minutes) but it also has great looking structure.  For example we were fishing at a couple spots where it was 10 feet of water with a sharp weed line that came up 7-8 feet (couple feet under the water) and other spots with 5 feet of water and slop and pads allover but we just couldn't seem to find them (I think our official excuse at the end of the day is that we were expecting the 20k winds the weather channel warned about and when those winds didn't show up it ruined our game plan - I thought it was a good excuse).  If you're looking for walleye it has several deep (30-50) holes and we were told they were hitting well just off the fast water by the dams but we didn't really try for 'eyes so I can't confirm that.
