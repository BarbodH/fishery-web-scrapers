Either you keep crossing their eyes or they will frustrate to death. IM FRUSTRATED for sure now.   Other then a couple bumps and follows to the boat and visting about a dozen areas that should have had produced- NADA!   Worked areas from 6 foot shoals to deep into 35 feet. The most consistent hook marking in about 25 FOW. Talked to at least 5 other tourney guys and the results were almost carbon copies of our day.  Fish bit a Lucky Craft suspending jerkbait in Bone colour on 8 foot rock pile.  TbayBoy was great company out there today and kept me from slitting my wrists.  On the positive side...found some REALLY NICE Jumbo Perch that we put a whopping to.  Largest 5 at 12 inches and really fat. Got myself a small feed tonite. I will be fishing the Rocky Madsen Perch event tomorrow out of Sibbald P.P with what we found.  Schools are 7 feet thick in some areas. Focus on 28-35 FOW out from Pefferlaw if your going out.  TbayBoy will have some pictures up soon I hope.  I need some sleep and ice for my elbow.  Take care.  MARK"

I,ll be working a few drop offs in the bay ,lets see what comes out of that.20 km from the south will keep me in the bay here.LOL  Thanks for sharing."

The school of shiners with the jumbo perch on them was a nice suprise (we were just cruising around checking structure when the whole graph filled up).  Here's Mark with the 2 best of the day.  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1171/1460081739_6a32733ffd_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Simcoe Perch"" /></a>  Would have been nice to get into a few more (any) of those smallies but still it was a gorgeous day and I learned a lot from Mark.  Top that off with a tasty perch dinner tonight and I'm happy I went out.  Thanks again Mark  Sean"
