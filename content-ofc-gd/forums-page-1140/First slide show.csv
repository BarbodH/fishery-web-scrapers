119639,tbayboy,2007-10-01 21:24:00,1497,"Nice slide show.  If you want it to play directly in the forum topic just switch the ""Post Options"" at the bottom to ""HTML On - Auto Linebreak Mode"" and then paste in the HTML tag in the list of photo bucket options and you'll get something like this:  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i63.photobucket.com/remix/player.swf?videoURL=http%3A%2F%2Fvid63.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fh136%2Fmikepike_2006%2F30b67f24.pbr&hostname=stream63.photobucket.com""></embed>"
