119705,ikoflexer,2007-10-02 00:51:00,10,"Just wondering, does anyone know for sure if it's illegal to use in Ontario lures which incorporate a lit LED?"
119708,Gerritt,2007-10-02 00:54:00,6129,quick answer...   NO.   Sorry... I thought your post asked if the were legal... they are not.  Gerritt.
119721,Terry,2007-10-02 01:10:00,14456,"funny, I thought if they are part of the lure, they are legal...I will have to check"
119724,Lostchild,2007-10-02 01:14:00,153,"It is not illegal to use them as long as the light is part of the lure.  Quote from the regulations state...  ""It is illegal to: Use artificial lights to attract fish except;  1. To fish for smelt, or to fish for lake whitefish or lake herring with a dip net.  2. If the light is part of a lure attached to a line used in angling."""
119725,FishFinder,2007-10-02 01:14:00,481,they are not illegal.
119732,ikoflexer,2007-10-02 01:20:00,10,"To be clearer.  I envision the LED with a small battery and water-sensitive switch to be integral part of the lure; epoxied on the inside, or on the side.  I don't really see this any different than the glow in the dark spoons lots of people use for salmon these days.  Also, does anyone know if they work any better than regular lures?"
