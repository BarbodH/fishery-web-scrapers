I'm an avid reader and was wondering if anyone had some book recommendation for books on freshwater fishing. Could be any species as long as it is informative.  2. When the bows and Browns start staging in late october, do you still fish for them at the piers with 3/4 oz cleos or do you downsize? Do you even fish at the piers with Cleos or use Roe or another bait/lure (Don't see how roe would be effective in a pier or large bay situation but I could be wrong).  Thanks for the help guys."

119616,mooseroo,2007-10-01 19:59:00,80, I've had luck with roe bags/single upstream but not at any of the trib mouths. Haven't tried much with spoons either.  Anybody else?
