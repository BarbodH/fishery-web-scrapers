See the lure that I had used last night, they look ugly,but sure works all the time. I lost a similar large one. The fish seemed to be hitting close to the surface last night  I used 1 oz and 3 /4 oz lure, one fish took it as soon as it hits the water, almost like a bass hitting a top water lure. This is the first time it had happened to me. All fish are fresh and fought so hard. There were also current on the water last night.  It took at least 10-15 minutes to land one of these, catching one of the largest one roughly 20lb+ fish was exciting. As soon as I cast the heavy spoon, was waiting for the spoon to sink a bit,  have not set the hook for there was a slack on my line, and the slamon took the lure, just jumped right out of the air, like  bass, and then I set the hook twice to make ensure a good hook set.  I was fishing by myself, hard to land the fish and also take decent pictures afterwards, there were no flat grassy surface where I can do a better photos.  All 5 fish caught were between 10:00pm to 11:30PM. I started fishing from 7:30pm till midnight. The pattern seemed to be the same lately, when the fish are hitting, they are hitting at certain short time frame, and then the feeding frenzy is gone.The moon was also out when it happened, and hours  before that, it was quiet. I believe I could catch more if I stayed on especially the moon was so bright, but I started to get too tired, and contented for the evening.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../salmon4low.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../salmon3low.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...bum/lurelow.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../closeuplow.jpg"
