119262,Jeff mcdonald,2007-10-01 00:42:00,2,"Has anyone fished the Trent River east of the Hasting Locks?  I'm looking at a few properties on the river but my only concern was if there is a healthy population of Musky, SM, and Walleye.  I watched somone fishing from shore catching Gobys and I didn't think that was a good sign.  The water was thick green with alge and I was hoping that it was just the time of the year.  Any input would be helpful.  Thanks,"

119387,bpsbassman,2007-10-01 12:14:00,941,I have fished in and around the hamlet of Trent River (just down from Hastings) and have had good luck with Musky and Largemouth. Welcome to the board.
