In some spots I had to slow down to about 65 km/h I was afraid that we will have very nasty conditions on the lake, but it was not as bad I as I’ve thought  Lake was almost clear    As soon as sun showed up thick fog patches started rolling in from the north    Even after 8 am some sometimes the lake looked like this     But couple hrs later     Still we’ve managed to hook few fish ( 4 pikes ,1 LMB, 1walleye ) My friend lost at the boat side fish of the day  ( LMB in 5lb range )  Highlights of the day  Walleye 4 lb     Pike – 31” 5lb 13 oz  "
