We didn't get into the brutes we did the previous week but I didn't take the camera    down that time either.  Does any one know how to load more pics, I am sure I have seen more pics then what I was able to load on this site.   I do have more.   "

Upload your pictures there then link them into your report via IMG tags (or embedded HTML).  I think if you search for image hosting on the board you'll find a few posts with some details on getting images up here."
