118860,myst,2007-09-29 15:26:00,57,Do you guys think Rapala is the best?
118862,2 tone z71,2007-09-29 15:35:00,1311,"I havent used Rapala in yrs ,I always get em good on Mepps,lucky strike ,jig,my new muskie fav is the turbo jack"
118865,bassfighter,2007-09-29 15:53:00,366,Jigs on grubs and tubs and spoons
118869,Mojoe,2007-09-29 16:06:00,3," I am not sure about the best, but the flo-orange J-7 has caught me more variety of fish than any other lure I have ever used."
118884,mepps,2007-09-29 17:18:00,1301,Mepps and my own spinners catch me more fish then anythign else.
118888,walleyedreamer,2007-09-29 17:55:00,101,"if i told you it would not be a secret so i say rapala lol happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer."
118907,misfish,2007-09-29 19:19:00,29133, Tubs must be hard to drag eh? LOL J/K  If I had to pick just one?????????????????????? Tube
118910,Hookset,2007-09-29 19:37:00,367,Soft Plastic Jerkbait for me. Probably 'cuz you can fish it fast or dead slow depending on the mood.   Hookset
118913,OhioFisherman,2007-09-29 20:10:00,6623,"Rapala makes some good lures, that said I don`t use them often. Tubes, plastic worms, jig and pig, buzzbaits, spinnerbaits, small crankbaits. I use rapalas as a surface twitch bait and have trolled them at times, cast a small shad rap but not much else."
118926,Musky or Specks,2007-09-29 21:32:00,2710,I dont have one favourite lure for all fish but definitely have a favourite for each species  Smallmouth Bass-- Watermelon Pepper Yamamoto grub-split shot rigged Largemouth Bass-- Purple and Black Jig with Purple salt crawpork Pike--Safety pin style Spinnerbait depending on colour of water will determine the colour I use Walleye-- Worm Harness with live bait Brook Trout-- Brook Trout Parr coloured EGB spoon size #2 Lake Trout--Blue/silver Little cleo tipped with a salted minnow tail Musky--- I have the most fun fishing Pete Mania's DOC but I have the most confidence fishing a Sneaky Pete or any other bulger double bladed bucktail. Resident Brown Trout- if not flyfishing I would have to say a Panther Martin  Nothing else I really fish for anymore but it is Salmon/Stellhead season so if I wasnt drift fishing roe or flyfishing I would have to say hot shoting skunk Quickfish/Flatfish always seemed to produce fish.
118933,kennyman,2007-09-29 21:50:00,737,"I'm no pro, but my favorite lure is a Storm chug bug. Caught bass,panfish and even walleye on that one. Conditions have to be calm for me to fish a chug bug. In the river with current I'll throw a mepps #3 chartreuse/black, a blue fox #4 perch patterned or a spinner bait, usually white/chartreuse. In the pads I'll throw a weedless #2 hook with a worm weight on top and a purple ribbon tail worm (approx. 5""). In the Long Point back bays I'll throw a Cordell Ripplin Redfin blue/chrome or any perch patterned lipless crankbait. I have quite a few Rapalas, but I haven't got them to work as well for me yet. I've had mild success with a HJ-5 (silver), but I'm still figuring them out. I think it's more operator error than anything."
118937,irishfield,2007-09-29 22:11:00,26272,Which ever one the fish is holding onto on said day........
118938,Moosebunk,2007-09-29 22:22:00,3970,"Nuthin' brings in fish like live bait.  Minnows mostly, sometimes worms, rarely leeches and frogs.  Sheer numbers baby.   I'm a fan of these most tried, tested and true lures of all time."
118969,Daplumma,2007-09-29 23:34:00,1961,"For some odd reason whenever I have a crankbait that is working well it always seems to be a Rapala.Husky Jerks,shad raps,broken back shad raps,x-raps and the flaoting minnow.All great baits,all imitated by many manufactorers.I think they may be the best on days when cranks are the ticket. Joe"
118970,Rizzo,2007-09-29 23:38:00,4754,"I'm a believer in the ""lyman"" saw a guy use one today and what an awesome action it had I'll definitely pick one up...oh yes I'm also a believer in the believer, although a swimm whizz will do in a pinch"
118975,Pigeontroller,2007-09-29 23:54:00,2793,"10"" Jakes, 10"" Jointed Believers, Jointed Depthraiders, Beaver Lures tri-spin Spinnerbaits, 9"" Suicks, Topraider, Pacemaker, Double D's, Shallowraiders..."
119122,Burning Babies,2007-09-30 15:56:00,150," The ""best bait"" is going to vary wildly from season to season, and even day-to-day.  For example, I caught bass on spinnerbaits all week, only to have to switch to a crankbait on Friday to catch anything.  I really like Rapala minnows in spring for bass, although I fish a lot of tubes, sluggos, and a few other options then as well."
119124,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-30 16:00:00,698,The best lure you have is your brain. A smart fisherman knows what lures to use on what days and in what conditions.
119220,fishindevil,2007-09-30 22:21:00,6254,Gotta be.....bottom bouncer worm/harness combo.....it will catch anything that swims & it has !!!!!!!!!
119225,Rizzo,2007-09-30 22:48:00,4754," unless you've got some grey matter with a treble, not sure that fits the description of a ""lure"""
119343,Garry2Rs,2007-10-01 04:29:00,1425,"I'm not sure what your real question is. If you are asking if Rapala is the best brand of crankbaits, in my opinion, they're as good as any, and better than most. If you're asking if a Rapala crankbait would be my first choice in all fishing situations, the answer is no.  But if I'm using a crankbait I will probably start with some sort of a Rapala. Here's some other thoughts... You will often hear that something is just as good as the name brand product...When you hear those words, you might be wise to buy the original...grin. Over the years I have bought some lures that never caught fish...I have never had a Rapala that didn't catch fish...but I have never had one that always caught fish either...that's fishing...grin. Some lures, I've had were hard to keep in tune, they didn't run straight, or were easily knocked out of tune.  I've never had that problem with a Rapala. Model for model, Rapala's seem to be a little more expensive than other brands, but each Rapala lure is tank tested to be sure that it swims properly before it's packaged...that has to be worth something. Most Rapalas are made of wood...I believe that wooden baits swim better than plastic ones do, but that's only my opinion, I'm sure there are many excellent plastic crankbaits too. In the past I have returned broken Rapalas to Normark in Oshawa and received replacements free.  I don't know if other manufacturers do that or not... garry2r's"
119396,Beans,2007-10-01 12:40:00,3339,"Years ago Rapalas (most models) were my #1 bait along with live bait...  Tubes, grubs, and senko type baits mostly now and very recently Fin-S minnows...(I hope that holds true for tomorrow at Simcoe)..."
119420,Raf,2007-10-01 13:37:00,3495,my best bait is the wet one
119467,John,2007-10-01 14:46:00,2956,Great response Raf. Nothing like keeping a lure wet for improving your chances.
119520,GbayGiant,2007-10-01 17:04:00,1780,If I had to choose only one it would be a 1/4oz chart jig and minnow.
