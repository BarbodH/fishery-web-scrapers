A fellow OFNer (sorry no names) has invited me to go out Salmon fishing and he said that I need some waders and other stuff to go. I can get the other stuff but I don't have waders and I wasn't planning on purchasing any until next year. I'm moving to first house soon so money is tight right now. If anyone knows where I could get a set for REALLY cheap or borrow (I live in Oshawa) then I would appreciate it. I really want to go Salmon fishing. I'm not sure how you measure them but I wear a size 12 shoe if it helps.  Thanks for any info."
