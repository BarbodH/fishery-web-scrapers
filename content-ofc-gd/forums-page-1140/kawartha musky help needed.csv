I fished in the weeds with bucktails, spinnerbaits burts, and suicks and trolled from 10 - 25' of water using believers, grandmas and a shallow invader without any luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers Jeff"

119265,joonmoon,2007-10-01 00:46:00,528,Keep at er we hooked two on Sat in Sturg. Look for deeper weeds near hard bottom transition areas. Troll open deep water. Just don't give up.
119274,Sinker,2007-10-01 00:59:00,8692,"Yup, just keep at er......I find that's the most important thing with them......never give up!!  I haven't been out fishing myself since the duck season opened, so I can't really help ya Jeff. The last musky I caught were all on an orange and black, 1oz spinnerbait though.....I caught about 20 of them on the same spinner. I was hitting the deep weed edges, and transitions from mud to rocks. Most fish were on the weed edges, but hooked a few good ones on transitions.......16-25 FOW.....rocks to mud.....just zig zagging along that line trolling about 3.5 mph. The weed edge fish were all casting though.....I like to cast more than troll, so I catch more casting.  Sinker"
