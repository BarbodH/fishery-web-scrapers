I was luanching Saturday at Beaverton and I saw a guy pulling a 17 foot Legend excalibur with a Impala and another guy pulling a 16 foot Crestliner with a Mazda 3 the question is not about towing capacity because obviously the cars are not rated to tow these loads but rather on insurance given these cars have towing capacities of 1000 lbs max. I was wondering if anybody knows what an insurance company would say if these people got into a accident while towing.

119475,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-01 15:04:00,4399, Well is it not an offense according to the highway traffic act to drive a vehicle that is over loaded.  Any insurance brokers out there have a answer?
