You cannot strip eggs from fish beyond your limit either. IF the salmon limit is two fish, you may only possess the eggs from two fish."
119781,nautifish,2007-10-02 02:13:00,1416,I am assuming this also if it is down by the creek also?  I just had to add that they're was also a father with his two sons yesterday the older son snagged a salmon in the back and instead of returning it to the water what did the father tell the son to do?  Toss it to the side on the grass......I could not beleive my eyes.  This is so sad!  I am forwarding on the video footage i have to the MNR. I was talking to one of out local bobbies tonight while wetting my line at the peir here in PD and he told me i should pass it on and they will for sure try to lay charges.  I do have a question though why are people taking so many females for eggs? Are they useing them to sell and make money?
119792,xrap,2007-10-02 02:28:00,683,They use the roe for fishing or they sell it. It's pretty dam expensive.
119796,nautifish,2007-10-02 02:38:00,1416,I understand the use for fishing but so many females. There are thousands of eggs in each female why take so many? Is that even legal? i am guessing it is not.
