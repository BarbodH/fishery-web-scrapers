662831,bow slayer,2012-02-02 13:34:00,1074,I will be in Erie PA for the weekend starting tomorrow for my daughters hockey tournament(seems wrong leaving the hotbed of hockey canada to go play in a tournament in Erie Pa) just wondering if anyone could point me towards a few outdoors or fishing stores in the area? thanks

662837,bigugli,2012-02-02 13:45:00,6138,"There was a Gander Mountain in the big mall, 3 years back."
662899,doubleheader,2012-02-02 16:16:00,497," In the mall on Peach Street there is a Gander Mtn. and a Dick's Sporting Goods. There's an Orvis store off of Rt 5 if I recall by the airport. Poor Richards has been mentioned, a good place to pick up local information. The other day the bay was still open water."

663236,BillM,2012-02-03 15:39:00,17367,"If you are going to fish Elk, fish upstream.  It was an absolute bust there yesterday..   I'd also check out a few of the Ohio tribs, especially the Conneaut.  That river is awesome."
663252,OhioFisherman,2012-02-03 16:41:00,6623,"I never shopped for tackle there, the bait store at the entrance to Presque Ilse park had a picture of a 4+ pound crappie caught in the bay. We had bass tournaments there once or twice a year for years. It usually took 12-15 pounds to win, with a 3 fish limit and restricted to the bay only. There are huge smallies a bit east of there in the open waters of Lake Erie, and they can increase the weight average.  There are Pike there, but like here it`s almost limited to a spring thing. I enjoyed fishing there in season. The bay itself has a good mix of shallow and deep water, and plenty of weed cover."
663268,DOS,2012-02-03 18:03:00,119,"If you get this in time,  the largest outdoor show in north america is on in Harrisburg PA. This week,  Well worth the drive if you can spare the time.  You will not take it all in in one day...  Not sure how much fishing stuff is there but if you are into hunting...WOW    RED"
664691,bow slayer,2012-02-08 18:32:00,1074,thanks for all the replies. Got to check out a few stores. Wish i could have had more time to shop around. There are some beautiful streams right around the erie area that look like they would be excellent trout streams...wish i could of brought some gear and drifted a few...but it was after all my daughters hockey tourny.
