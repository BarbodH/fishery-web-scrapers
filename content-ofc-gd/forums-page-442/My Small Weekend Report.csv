Good friends and good weather make it a great time...........catching some nice fish is a bonus. Tubes did most of the damage for me. Here are a few fish from the weekend.  Cheers, Colin                 "

664258,Rod Caster,2012-02-07 01:45:00,5784,I'd love to get into the whitefish/laker tandem you Simcoe guys are used to! They look so darn tasty  
664271,MJL,2012-02-07 02:07:00,2427,Sweet  Did the whities take tubes too?
664295,ckrb2007,2012-02-07 03:09:00,449,MJL.....look closely at pic #3  ...heehee
664310,frozen-fire,2012-02-07 04:13:00,542,"  Last year, I've had a few fish rocket off bottom and smack my tube 40 feet up. Thinking they were small lakers, it was truly surprising to see they were whities. Wish they were always that easy"
664316,Homer Is King,2012-02-07 04:31:00,305,Nice job!! Some great looking fish there!
664321,frozen-fire,2012-02-07 04:38:00,542,Just noticed you use an x67c... do you notice a delay?  Got a friend with one that has a very noticeable delay.
664329,Sinker,2012-02-07 06:21:00,8692,"Nice haul!!   If there is a delay, there is something wrong. There shouldn't be any at all. Turn up the ping speed, or chart speed....or the transducer is messed. Is this in flasher mode, or graph?  S."
