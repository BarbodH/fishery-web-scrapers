664378,babaganoush,2012-02-07 15:42:00,105,Just recently bought 2 new rods with fixed reel seats but unhappy with the position they are set at. Is it still possible to reposition the reel seat or am I stuck with where they are at.
664383,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-07 16:04:00,10439, It's possible but it takes time and if you take it to a builder a bit of $$$$. The handle will need to be stripped off and replaced completely.
664398,babaganoush,2012-02-07 16:55:00,105,That's good to hear. Any rod builders in here want a job?
664400,Spiel,2012-02-07 16:59:00,9065,Is it not possible to return them?
664401,babaganoush,2012-02-07 17:04:00,105, A little too late now but I really like the rods
664406,Spiel,2012-02-07 17:29:00,9065,   Well then it would seem you have the above option Drifter posted or living with them as is.  Are you anywhere near Hamilton?
