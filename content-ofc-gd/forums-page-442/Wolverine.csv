664458,Fishnwire,2012-02-07 21:09:00,983,"I saw a show about a biologist who had been studying wolverines for something like 15 years and he said that in that time, other than trapped or dead animals, he'd only seen one in the wild three times.  Even if they are around, it's unlikely you'd see one."

664575,Fishnwire,2012-02-08 10:57:00,983,"  That's not ""pretty cool""...that's super cool.  Wolverine skull...cool. Abandoned bald eagle nest...cool. Canoe trip in NWT...cool.  Everything you just said, is way cool."
664580,Skipper D,2012-02-08 11:50:00,1970,"Never saw one in my life , but you never now right . Living here just north of Barrie i have from time to time seen a few strange things , mid 90's out walking in my bush one day , i came across tracks that looked like bear tracks , thought no way , kept my mouth shut and never told any one for fear they'd say i was crazy , never even told my family , then a few days later down the road in Midhurst the MNR shoots a young Bear out of a tree in the yard of the day care center . Another time while out doing some custom combing on the second of Oro  and of course at the time i was in the feild by my self dumping into wagons , i was going up thru the feild and caught this thing in the corner of my eye walking along the fence row at the other end of the feild , it looked like a big light  coloured dog , as i combined a watch it fallow the fence line comeing closer to where i was working , it came straigt in front of me to the point that i could see it was no dog but one hell of a big cat , it had the cat shaped head , a tail to long for a dog , i thought its a cougar but no way and again you don't dare say any thing to no one . Like with the bear a few days later on the Barrie tv news Big curve Acers farm on hwy 11 claims a cougar took down one of their young horses in the night .The best one tho to me was in 1989 a year after moving to Midhurst  to come home one night from work to see a moose standing on my front lawn with the OPP sitting on the sholder of the road watching the thing and telling every one to stay back .  So i beleive any thing is possible out there , i just wont be the one who tell's ya ."

664768,lhousesoccer,2012-02-09 00:23:00,442,"No, but I saw a honey badger once .... honey badger don't care .....  "
664775,Sharkbait22,2012-02-09 00:35:00,297,I've seen a few - not in Ontario.  Several in NWT around a stream I use to regularly visit and one backcountry skiing in Jasper.  Not that large of an animal - I didn't feel any fear. They have a bad temper so I hear but all ran away quickly. Built up to be more dangerous than they are - like wolves?
664922,desship,2012-02-09 15:17:00,96,While canoeing the Missinabi north of Mattice in the 70s we thought we cornered a bear cub on small island .Turned out it was a wolverine it came straight at us and forced the six us to give way once we realized what it was.
664949,richyb,2012-02-09 16:35:00,774,"I seen a dead one on the train tracks just south of sudbury. They are nasty critters and will fight a bear if they have to. Just like any animal, they are more scared of you than you are of them UNTIL they get cornerd then look out  The muskoka wildlife center on hwy 11 had a wolverine that last time that I was there."
664978,discophish,2012-02-09 18:20:00,392,"Okay, so I am not the only crazy one ... phew.    I wasn't on shrooms ... I was on the gas ... wait ... pedal while driving on 69. We were the only vehicle on the road at the time, and it came within 20 feet ... by ""it"" I mean the wolverine and by ""69"" I mean the highway if you were thinking any differently.  We have Martins and Fishers at the cottage, and have seen them as well.  This was a Wolverine.  I saw it.  My girlfriend saw it.  I have also seen a cougar in Hunstville.  Call me crazy.  I just might be."
664203,kuhaman,2012-02-07 00:05:00,503,Has anyone ever seen a wolverine in central or northeastern Ontario?
664212,bushart,2012-02-07 00:19:00,2628,Well a lot of folks may think I'm nuts---been a bush guy for a long time  But I think I seen one last year on the shore of a lake---definetely not common to see around here. Eastern Ontario
664219,kuhaman,2012-02-07 00:43:00,503,My brother swears he saw one north of Lavigne last summer. I'm thinking it was probably a Fisher.
664222,cram,2012-02-07 00:49:00,1733,Does North Bay count as central ontario?
664224,bushart,2012-02-07 00:52:00,2628,I familiar with the fisher/otter families  this was'nt it
664228,kuhaman,2012-02-07 00:56:00,503,My brother saw it near Lavigne which is I'm guessing a half hour away from North Bay.Guess I should add the near north too.
664230,Raf,2012-02-07 00:58:00,3495,would love to see one.. i think.  they get quite big - up to 70lbs for males
664231,bow slayer,2012-02-07 01:00:00,1074,"i saw a dead one on highway 69 right near six mile lake  2 summers ago,yes i am sure it was one I have seen a few in michigan."
664232,Muskieman,2012-02-07 01:02:00,2472,  They have been sighted in this area..
664239,vinnimon,2012-02-07 01:14:00,2593,Came across one due north of randys area a few years back.
664254,Rod Caster,2012-02-07 01:39:00,5784,"Some guy near Widdifield Station road in North Bay said he saw one in his dogs pen, it was playing with a cougar.... Just kidding  I've actually never heard of any sightings around here. My guess is that most sightings are mistaken with fishers"
664264,mercman,2012-02-07 01:56:00,7054,  You have X-Men in your neck of the woods ?? Right on Randy !!!

664273,irishfield,2012-02-07 02:09:00,26272,Probably just a big Fisher..  
664276,cram,2012-02-07 02:25:00,1733, That's a fisher.  Or at least not a wolverine.  Very cool pic though.
664289,irishfield,2012-02-07 02:54:00,26272,Why I said probably just a big fisher.. as that is what I posted a pic of (walking across my pool deck) so he can show his brother.
664291,Roy,2012-02-07 02:58:00,13728,I doubt very very much you'd ever see one that far south.
664292,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-07 03:02:00,10439,I had one walk across the end of my driveway last winter.
664294,OhioFisherman,2012-02-07 03:04:00,6623,"No, and I view them as an animal better viewed from a safe place. I found it odd to see there were Fishers in Rhode Island were one of my daughters used to live, not all that far from major cities."
664313,Kingsalmon,2012-02-07 04:21:00,107,My father and I saw one while spring bear hunting about twenty years ago near Kaladar Ont.  We initially thought it was a bear but then saw the faint brown lines down the length of its body and long tail.  We watched it from the tree stand for about five minutes before it left.  Unfortunately we did not have a camera but I could have taken him at any time.     I knew that there was no season for them as they were fur bearing animals. This I knew because I just did my hunting course a couple week earlier.
664317,NAW,2012-02-07 04:32:00,4022,I've never seen one.  Not sure I'd want to.  There are lots of fishers around my area though.  At least two living with in a 5km stretch of road.
664375,Nemo,2012-02-07 15:16:00,727,If you are into Wolverines you should watch this show on PBS's Nature Series.  http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/wolverine-chasing-the-phantom/introduction/5759/  I PVR'ed it last week and watched it. It was a very good show. If you hunt around I bet you can find it being aired again. Or maybe on Youtube etc.  Good Luck
664386,torco,2012-02-07 16:17:00,656,  I have seen that documentary it is very well done. I really enjoy that series on PBS
