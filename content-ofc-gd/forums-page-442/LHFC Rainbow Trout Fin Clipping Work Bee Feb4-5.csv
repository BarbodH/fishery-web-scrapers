664439,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-07 19:17:00,1622," So they know it`s stocked & the year class, different fin different year SBK"
664568,spinnerbaitking,2012-02-08 05:11:00,1622,"  This comes from one of the guys in the Know, We clip adipose, always for Saugeen steelhead. We did vent clips early on in the program, but each year since has been adipose, and it will stay adipose clips. This is an agreement with the MNR. Year class means nothing, just the fact that they are O.S./LHFC fish is the reason they are clipped, by MNR mandate Thanx & Tight Lines SBK"
