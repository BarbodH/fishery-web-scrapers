660855,Spouph,2012-01-27 00:12:00,115,"  Ya I am pretty sure there are at a store in Belleville, goggle quinte ice fishing team, they may even be sponsored by them now.  They will know where to get them..  I had no issue with sizing, they asked me like 5 measurements, it fit perfect.  It was shipped on the day they said it would be.  I was leary as well but no problems"
660865,kickingfrog,2012-01-27 00:35:00,8333," We did this back in college at Sir Sandford Fleming. One night we had a ""class"" at the community centre pool. We jumped into the water with rubber boots, hip and chest wadders, pfds, lifejackets and floater coats. We practiced all sorts of different self and assisted rescue scenarios.  BTW water in your boots and wadders will not sink you. IF your boots/wadders fill with water the water inside is not denser than the water outside. Getting out of the water into a boat is not easy, but you will not, can not sink because of water in your boots. No one is going to break the Olympic freestyle swimming record in wadders either, but as long as you don't panic self rescue is possible."
660871,Terry,2012-01-27 00:46:00,14456,but if there is a current waders will drag you under and along with the current
660878,kickingfrog,2012-01-27 01:04:00,8333,And if I hit my head I'm dead. Nobody said a wadding belt wasn't a good idea.
660886,BillM,2012-01-27 01:26:00,17367,"I've been under a few times in my waders, it's not like water just pours in there like everyone would think.  I swam a good 5-6 seconds with my waders completely underwater and I took maybe 4-5 cups of water out of them at the car..    I was soaked, but far from filling up with water and pulling me downstream to my death, lol."
660909,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-27 02:16:00,3761," I'll sink but the suit is pretty waterproof. It would take a few seconds and first reaction is to stay calm and get ur arms on the ice...then roll up on. Went out on some shallow water perch fishing on 2"" of ice...then moved out to 10' and still I have lot's of confidence on the ice. I am safe not stupid, I walk out drill holes send lightest in front and well I got lucky that day maybe.  But on the upside I have extreme comfort. Great pockets, hand warmer compartments and well its too warm sometimes. The nice cuffs on the frabill suits is nice too.  So why not try Survival Suit over Floater. Well it's basic. If you want to guarantee u float then go out on any ice and take ur chances  or do it the safe way like me and just be in something warm like I am and be happy. Many people use these type suits with not many complaints. If you want something for late season ice try one. You will love it, 2 pieces is soo nice too right. sweater on and bib, great for fall and spring fishing in the boat."
660944,goteeboy,2012-01-27 03:12:00,175,"i was under a tight budget so I bought a Fladen.  Not really well known in Canada, but supposedly very popular in Europe.  I searched a bunch of reviews and they seemed positive.  They are relatively cheap too.  Only 85pounds or 134 $Can. Which is really really cheap.  From what I know, most, if not all of the suits ice fishermen wear are FLOATATION Suits, not Survior suits.  Big difference.  If I'm not mistaken, the survivor suit is meant to slow down hypothermia in water and is more like a neoprene suit. But the floatation suit is meant to keep you from going under.  In either case, you gotta get out of the ice.  So IMHO, all a floatation suit needs to do is keep you floating so you can use your picks to pull yourself out as quickly as possible.  After that, i guess it's about fit and comfort.  So for me, i don't need to spend 400 on a mustang.  See: http://www.cheaplifejackets.co.uk/one-piece-flotation-suit-blue-yellow-from-10999-free-shippin-c-23-p-1-pr-16165.html  This site has user reviews. http://www.uk-fishing-tackle.co.uk/  It's warm, bright, not your typical orange (not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing), high collars, a hood, neoprene wrists, big pockets.  Only complaint is that the legs could use a zipper for wider boots.  Anyway, another option for you."
660989,misfish,2012-01-27 10:06:00,29133, Learned that lesson along time ago.
660995,wormdunker,2012-01-27 10:38:00,1711,"Well I took the plunge & bought a floater (not survival) suit.  It is very comfortable, not bulky & awkward like most Mustangs, buoy o buoy. It is a HJC who also makes helmets.  Lots of full length zippers & velcro.  It is a 2 piece, has lined pockets, cloth lined collar.  On a mild day remove the jacket, open some zippers on the bib style pants. Many nice features & very comfortable for mobility.  U should take a look at them, I'm happy with it.  I'll be trying it out tomorrow at the M&G on Nipissing."

660017,Woodsman,2012-01-25 00:00:00,1286,"Completely ignore this advice. The Canadian Coast Guard is not the approving authority in Canada. The approving authority in Canada is the Department of Transport(Canada). If it says ""Canadian Coast Guard Approved"" it is one of two things. 1: Old stock.(more than a few years) Or 2: A counterfeit product.  To the best of my knowledge both the Buoy O Buoy & the Helly Hansens are approved by the Department of Transport(Canada). I know my Helly Hansen is approved by the Department of Transport(Canada)."

I went thru the Ice on quinte down strean the bridge, last march, It sealed up around my legs I did not have my top on and it bobbed me up like a pencil in a glass of water, I could feel the current pulling me under, this suit saved my life, I am sure a survival suit would of been good as well, but there was no bulky floatation,I had no problem getting out. Not coastguard approved, in canada, at least they were not when I bought them 5 years ago.  Oh yea after I fell through the bottom of my arms were the only things that got wet I fished the rest of the morning the kissed the ground when i got in."

660124,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-25 12:51:00,2690, Think part of the problem is they aren't sold in as many locations as the Mustangs or Helly Hansens. Perhaps they need a better marketing team??
660153,NAW,2012-01-25 14:02:00,4022,"You are bang on with that one Frankie!  They have a distributor list on their website.  Most cities have a few places that sell them.  But I've found that most of the distributors don't carry the full line of models.  Eg. The Rack and Reel in Barrie carries Salus, but they only have the ""Comfort Class"", which is their cheapest suit.  I had to order in my ""Endurance Class"".  Well worth the wait!"
660187,Raf,2012-01-25 15:58:00,3495," was not aware of this change, CCG used to be the authority.  Does that mean any life jackets we may buy need to be Dept of Transport Canada approved in order to be legal."
660204,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-25 16:53:00,535,"  Is there anywhere to buy them around Belleville? I definetely need something this year and I want something I can move around in while musky fishing, nothing too bulky or stiff.  I had to go into the water in Haliburton in the middle of October to get my trailor out of the boat launch (snagged something and bent the axle) and even before winter the water was cold enough that I literally couldn't breathe when the water hit my chest. If I fall out of the boat in fall while musky fishing I'd be in serious trouble. I'm a pretty good swimmer but the initial shock would more than likely be too much."
660436,wormdunker,2012-01-26 02:43:00,1711,"Thanx for all the replies, many different opinions.  The main ingredient is most suits R awkward & uncomfortable.  Hell we put many people on the moon, why can't we protect a fisherman, cause fishing is very important!!!"
660440,cram,2012-01-26 02:53:00,1733,Salus tends to sell more to ocean-boaters than inshore.  Not sure why.  Their stuff is supposedly amazing.  I have a helly hansen alpha and it's great too.  Highly recommended.
660530,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-26 12:13:00,3761, I have a Frabill Ice suit that I love. It's pricy but well worth it. Waterproof padded knees warm as hell. All I put under it is a thermal long sleeve and I'm set for any day on the ice.  Check them out  http://frabill.com/icesuit-5.html

660550,Woodsman,2012-01-26 13:11:00,1286,"Yes all new life jackets need to be approved by the Department of Transport(Canada). It's been this way for at least a few years. Any older life jacket that was approved by the Canadian Coast Guard is still legal for use as long as it's still in good condition.  Copied from Transport Canada's website:  Approval Process for Lifejackets and PFDs  Both lifejackets and PFDs are built to specific standards and are approved based on tests carried out on sample products submitted by manufacturers to a testing laboratory recognized by the approval authority. In Canada, the approval authority for lifejackets and PFDs is Transport Canada.  Manufacturers of devices that have received approval are subsequently subject to an ongoing follow up system as a measure of continued quality control. The approval issued applies only to unmodified devices as built by manufacturers of approved products. Modifications to an approved device will void approval.  Approvals are not issued for individual products nor can they be issued retroactively."

660795,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 22:12:00,34,I find float suits to be heavy.They are also cumbersome.I picked up a Helly Hanson I find it heavy.I looked at the Salus after the fact.The Salus is half the weight and is a bit more flexible .Just my 2 cents.
660806,Terry,2012-01-26 22:34:00,14456,and arctic armor is light and flexible and floats fantastically ...but not approved but who cares
660818,misfish,2012-01-26 22:47:00,29133, How do you know this bud?  I like the suit you have. Im going to work some extra overtime to pick me up one

I use mine for musky fishing right from sept till december.	I beat it up and still no holes."
660834,Sinker,2012-01-26 23:13:00,8692," This will be my next suit for sure. Mainly because they come in camo, but i also think the 2 piece suit is the way to go. You get more use out of it.  They are super light and flexible. You wouldn't even think they float by looking at them. Nothing like a floater suit at all.  S."
660849,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-26 23:58:00,535,  Thanks! I'd rather buy one in person than order one online to make sure it fits right.

Any suggestions as to what I should buy.  I'm leaning toward a 2 piece as I have the need to remove the top on certain days.  I was on Nipissing last Sunday & wish I could remove the jacket because of the mild temps. Are all these survival suits bulky & awkward?  I've heard of the new Helly Hansens & Salus suits.  Your comments & suggestions are much appreciated.  Thanx"
659731,turtle,2012-01-24 11:37:00,274,"I've had a Mustang Atlantic class one piece for 15+ years and I am happy with it.  Having said that it's now beat up and the lining is going so I'll get a new one soon. They are a bit bulky but so is wearing many layers to keep out the cold.  They are warm, too warm some days.  I call it a walking sauna.  The advantage of a 2 piece is taking the jacket off and not sweating as much when active, the disadvantage is if you go for a swim the water can come in making you colder faster."
659756,John,2012-01-24 13:18:00,2956," I too have Mustang Atlantic, but two piece and wish I had a one piece. You can always pull your arms out and let it hang around your waist.  BTW if you go for a swim one or two piece ain't gonna make any difference to how cold you get, (assuming you are wearing the jacket of the two piece at the time)..."
659811,wkrp,2012-01-24 15:42:00,656,Salus suits are comfortable and very well made right here in ontario. I have owned one for two years and love it. They are a little pricier but well worth it.
659815,BillM,2012-01-24 15:50:00,17367,I think the best suit out there is the Mustang Integrity HX.   It's also the most expensive.  I had to sell mine because it was a bit short and replaced it with a Helly Hanson.

659871,Acountdeleted,2012-01-24 18:02:00,2562, If these last another month I'll pick one up. Just started my new job and funds are tight right now.

It dosent say if it,s a floater suit or not,or I missed it along my readings.  I have the Natulis pro series. It,s nice and warm,but to bulky.Im looking to buy new before next season."
659890,Sinker,2012-01-24 18:47:00,8692,"Take a look at the arctic armour suits. They are two piece, but warm as hell, very flexible, and super comfortable.They are also laid out better than any other floater suit I've seen, with regards to pockets, and hand warming aids.  I have a helly hanson soft flex now, its great. I had a mustang before this one, and it was also great. Lasted me about 15 years of hard use. I wear mine from the beginning of september duck hunting, till the end of april most years, so its not a 3 or 4 times a season wear. My Helly Hanson suit is going on its 5th season, and I have no complaints except for the wrist bands and there is no camo suits. They are uncomfortable at the wrists, and never stay done up properly. I always pull my wool sweater down past the cuffs of the suit for comfort and warmth on my wrists.  Anyways, they're all good. Try some on, find a good price, and pull the trigger.  Ya can't go wrong either way. By far the most used fishing/hunting tool I own, and worth every penny if you do take a late season dunking!! I fished out in that rain yesterday for 4 hours straight, and came home dry as a bone.  S."
659891,Raf,2012-01-24 19:12:00,3495,"Whatever you decide to go with, it's a good idea to make sure it Canadian Coast Guard approved.  Especially if you plan on using it in the boat in the early spring/late fall.  May be different now, but the old buoy o buoy & helly hansens were not."
659896,mike rousseau,2012-01-24 19:28:00,4661,I currently have a nautalus floater suit...1 peice...  It's a really good suit...  But over the years I started to wonder... Why not find a comfortable snowsuit  that you really like... Then wear an inflatable life vest...?
659901,Grimace,2012-01-24 19:52:00,2020,The snowsuit will get waterlogged and the vest won't hold you up.  The flotation in the legs allows you to float horizontal and attempt getting your legs and big ole boots up on the ice.  The insulation in the suit keeps the water in so cold water from lake can't continue to circulate and cool your body temperature further.  Tighten up those ankles and wrists when you go in.  Your body will then only have to deal with the water in your suit not the whole lake.  Edit: Typo
659910,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 20:20:00,2690,"  The new Helly Hansens are.  Good point though, if you are going for a floater suit, get something that will truly float."
659912,misfish,2012-01-24 20:27:00,29133,"Question for ya all.  How many have put their suit on and jumped in the water and see how it reacted?   I did this one summer after I bought mine. I wanted to know how it would react,and how I would move in it.  Im talking my heavy winter boots and under garments as well. It,s a pretty cool feeling to know that your body will float,but you need to know that the floater is only one eliment. You need the ice piks as well to pull you out.  Water does get in the suit and yes you are wet.Summer water was ok,but I sure as hell,cant amagine having that dick shrivel temp, in my suit.   DONT FORGET YOUR HAND PIKS."
659918,Terry,2012-01-24 20:37:00,14456,"it depends on what you want to use it for  I used one piece suits for over 20 years but found 2 piece suits were better and just as warm but still stiff clam ice armor seemed to be the answer light warm made for icefishing but not floater  now I went for Arctic Armor Plus Suit super light weight and easy to move in and real warm..it is what I have been looking for for years it is a floater suit but not listed with canada coastguard ...so if you use it in the boat you must have a lifejacket with you now if we had ice and if I could get out fishing, I would be a happy camper"
659923,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-24 20:40:00,826,VERY TRUE!!!  The picks will likely play a greater role in saving your life. The orange suit will make you easier to find.
659925,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-24 20:44:00,2690,"  Good point, and,"
659939,pics,2012-01-24 21:23:00,1268,The Helly Hanson is comfortable....The alfa model has internal suspenders so you can remove the top section to cool off without taking the whole outfit off....
659941,Raf,2012-01-24 21:32:00,3495,The suspenders are a nice touch too.  Relieve some of the pressure of the weight of the suit off your back after wearing it all day.  I have a mustang and wish my model came with suspenders.
