663797,SirWhite,2012-02-05 21:08:00,210,"Hey guys, Next weekend marks the first ""hardwater"" fishing weekend of my fishing buddies and I. We've reserved a ""Super Bungalow"" and looks like we'll be put in the south bay. I am excited to get a line back in water as I have not been out since Sept. Anyways, with all the Nippissing hard icers in here, I figured I might gain a bit of OFC knowledge. Thanks in advance, Nipfisher!  1st question o'great fishers is, are there vehicles on the ice in that area? Was told usually just park next to hut, but of course I am a bit weary of that.  2nd question is, which lures should I be jigging? Ill have the tried and true Mr.J and Williams Wabbler, Jigging Rap, and spoons. I do NOT want Perch, I don't in summer and I don't in winter. I am really trying for a PB after I had such a skunky summer (one big smallie). So its big Walleye and Northerns that I'm really after.  3rd question o'great fishers is, are there any things you would have brought to a hut, had you known what it was going to be like?  I really appreciate belonging to this forum, I have already learned so much, that come summer ILL be the new ""go to guy"" in my group.  Can't wait till Friday!!!"

Dangling a minnow on a hook can also be very effective. As for the bungalows most of them have everything you need. Maybe a deck of cards or something like that when the fishing is slow.  Kuha"

663847,SirWhite,2012-02-06 00:25:00,210,"Ice bungalows, I believe is who were with. I will def post a report on how it goes."
663864,Bassnbows,2012-02-06 01:04:00,58,"Lots of vehicals everywhere on the south side 18"" of ice. We were out with Idyl Tyme the past 3days. It was a blast even though the fish were a little on the smaller side. just make sure your up for the early bite. they come in for a few hrs then you basically have to wait for the evening bite. Quite a bit of dead time, but thats how it goes sometimes. We hite about 10 smaller Pickerel, 2 2lb Herrings and some perch. Most were caugh on minnows/jigs. Jigged up a few pics. on Buckshots and Sweedish Pimples.Good Luck."
663876,Rod Caster,2012-02-06 01:43:00,5784,"I drove on the ice today.. it's safe in most places, but still, be cautious. We don't have the amount of ice we typically get. Approx 18 inches right now.  Rip jigging a 3 or 4 inch spoon or jiggin rap should get you some walleye... maybe try a 6inch lively chub as well for the big girls."

Wow hope I do some verticle jigging in summer cause this was expensive. Def had a lot of fun clearing out my tackle box  of summer Cranks, spinners and Jitterbugs lol.  Thanks for all the posts, will definetly get some hand sanitizer!"
