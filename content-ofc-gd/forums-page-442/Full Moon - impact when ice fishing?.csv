With the drastic changes in temps over the last 2 days fishing has sucked. Marking lots of fish and can put the bait in front of them but not biting.   I was thinking about going to the hut tonight from 8 - midnite. Unfortunately, I fell asleep puting my little guy to bed and woke up after 9.    Question is.....anyone have better or less success fishing the full moon during winter?"

As an example Feb 7 the moon rise was 6pm and moon set was 7am so midpoint was 12:30am. Best fishing would be between 11:30pm and 1:30am. Two days before and two days after works as well, just adjust times."
