664620,Jer,2012-02-08 14:25:00,1426,"Last night we were out on Buckhorn for a couple hours and did rather poorly compared to most evenings over the last couple weeks.  Usually we've been getting a steady perch bite until almost sundown, then a brief lull and then a pretty good crappie bite for half an hour or so. Last night the bite was almost completely shut down.  The ice was angry with an almost constant rumble like a thunder storm with lots of sharp cracks, whacks and bangs. Making ice I guess with the cold temps and no snow cover.  Do ya think this effects the fish? We're only on top of 8 or 9 feet of water so I imagine the fish must feel the vibrations from the cracking ice, it was about as loud as I've ever heard it."
664630,EC1,2012-02-08 15:00:00,930,"I remember having caught fish over noisy ice, but I can't see why not. I'd say panfish are usually more timid compared to others, but you shouldn't discount the ice making weather. We've had rather warm temps for the last while and then you got this ""cold"" day all of a sudden."
664632,bushart,2012-02-08 15:03:00,2628,Those are just big Wallys rubbin their backs on the bottom of the ice
664651,Nipfisher,2012-02-08 16:06:00,2449,Was thinking the same thing today. I was out on Callander Bay and I have NEVER heard the ice so loud. There were significant cracks in the ice that were not there yesterday.........      including one that runs right under my hut.    
664668,mercman,2012-02-08 17:12:00,7054,I REALLY needed to see this 2 days before going ice fishing for the 1st time since i was 12   
664674,mike rousseau,2012-02-08 17:21:00,4661,  Ha...  Your gunna be on way worse ice then that...lol... There are only a few people willing to walk on the ice you'll be on Saturday... Lol  Cracks arent a bad thing...
664680,mercman,2012-02-08 17:32:00,7054,  ''COUGH''  ''COUGH''  Mike..........i got a bad cold......I'm gonna have to cancel
664703,Homer Is King,2012-02-08 19:50:00,305,"Ice cracks when it is cold and the lake is ""making"" ice.  It's growing, casing stress, which is released by cracking.   That's way ""loud ice is safe ice"".  Melting ice makes no noise!!  As far as shutting the fish down.  It probably doesn't help.  Thunder seams to shut them down too.  If it's gotten really cold out that means a high pressure system has moved in.  High pressure cold fronts tend to slow the fishing right down.  This could be a bigger factor than the noisy ice.  "
664708,Jer,2012-02-08 20:06:00,1426,"   Well that's our usual ""go to"" excuse...Cold Front!!!"
664779,Sharkbait22,2012-02-09 00:42:00,297,I don't know about the making ice idea.  Ice is growing all the time and it doesn't make that kind of noise. It's likely just rapid changes in temperature causing ice to contract or expand? I love that sound .. when on good ice.
