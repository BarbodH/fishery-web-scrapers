I also don't have a float rod and will just be using my spinning gear.  Dose anyone have any tips of what i should be doing, looking for or rigging style.  If anyone can help it would be great.  thx"

Part of fishing is getting out there and trying your luck, not relying on other ppl to tell you where to go and what to use.  If this is what your looking for you should be looking into a guide."

664799,northernpike56,2012-02-09 01:50:00,717,"i got a 22"" brown casting hardware in the harbour a few days ago  just get out there and youll catch 'em!"
664878,Aaron Shirley,2012-02-09 13:14:00,655,"River mouths and piers are a good place to fish now. Casting spoons, cranks and spinners can get bites. Roe bags, nightcrawlers and emerald shiners can work well under a float or with a slip sinker off bottom. Bucktail jigs can work as well as flies. There are many different ways to catch them, you just have to figure out what is working when you try it.  Good luck and hope you tie into some winter trout!"
