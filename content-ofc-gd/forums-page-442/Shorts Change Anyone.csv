664381,Joey,2012-02-07 16:00:00,9122,"Yikes, close call for sure"
664417,irishfield,2012-02-07 18:08:00,26272,Hard to believe that he only backed up that much.. and then shut the friggin machine off!! What a fool.. or is that tool ?!
664422,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-07 18:27:00,10439,  I think he was afraid reversing the sled would break another chunk of snow off sending him to an early grave. Better to be bhind the sled on safer snow in case the cornice breaks off. Then he would only lose his sled and not his life. Probably not thinking real clear in that kind of situation though.
664552,Nipfisher,2012-02-08 03:57:00,2449,"  Looks like he actually knew where he was driving to, and just over shot the top of the mountain and went on to the drift. He only needed to back up a little bit so the weight of the machine is on the mountain top."
664817,Rizzo,2012-02-09 03:06:00,4754,what an awesome jump that would make if he hit it at full speed
