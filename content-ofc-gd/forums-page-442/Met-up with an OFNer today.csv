Had a great visit as fortunately (unfortunately) he wasn't too busy at the time...  Sorry for dumping all that loose change on you pal but I broke my last fiver at McDonalds for a couple of breakfast wraps earlier and the bank was my first stop once I got to Bobcaygeon...  If you are in the area and need some auto service keep Ernie in mind...  I think the address is 125 Queen Street, Lindsay"
