664146,Cudz,2012-02-06 21:43:00,2652,"lol.  Give me a break.  I knew you would say that beacause he is a slot.  Is he 6'2"" with a 40 inch ver and runs a 4.2 40? no but lots of those ""wide outs"" won't run a slant across the middle like Welker. Welker is faster than you think and he often does draw double from the LB and a safety (not a corner).  If you don't think he is elite because of an article THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN JUNE BEFORE THE SEASON STARTED, you need to look at other articles. The numbers don't lie.  A receiver can look awesome on paper and be very average on teh field.  Welker looks below average on paper yet leads the NFL in 5 of the 9 major categories.  I guess Elite up here means something totally different.  my bad  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/909110-top-5-wide-receivers-in-the-nfl-this-season#/articles/909110-top-5-wide-receivers-in-the-nfl-this-season/page/5"

We here in Denver would covet Welker and this coming from a team that ran Brandan Marshall outta town.  And don't let the door hit ya in the   on the way out."
664159,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 22:37:00,5865, You better check that again because at the end of the year Cliff ended up in 3rd place while the Redneck finished 1st...
664161,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 22:43:00,5865, I gave you a break when I said he was a outstanding receiver.....sorry he's NOT a Elite Receiver as there are only a very few in the league...but we'll all call him a ELITE receiver if it makes you sleep better tonight....   BOTTOM LINE HE DROPPED THAT PASS    AND    WAIT FOR IT         THE NEW YORK GIANTS WON !    (all because Wes Welker can't catch)   LOL
664164,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-06 22:49:00,336,"  Ok Ok My bad.   This is for you      Well then, congrats.    Now I'll go Tebow in my corner"
664168,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 22:54:00,5865, NOW...don't get me started on TEBOW.....
664174,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-06 23:06:00,336," Just might be the quickest way to lock this thread up. I'll tell ya what, out here its all Tebow all the time.  With the 2' of snow we got recently, well here you go. http://ironicsurrealism.com/tag/tebowed/"
664188,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 23:39:00,5865," THAT'S a GOOD ONE....LOL  I don't know what I would do with Tim Tebow on my team...but I would find a spot for him......he sucks as a thrower but carries himself very good as a NFL QB who can't make many good throws....I glad he had a good season as he's one of the few players who knows how to act on and off the football field....I'm tired of the celebrating player who just made a routine play and acts like he just won the game for his team all while his team is losing by 30 points or more....guys, that act has gotten OLD a very long time ago."
664199,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-06 23:56:00,336,"Yeah, I'm with ya there.  He does have this inane leadership ability to raise everyone's game.  Of course, Buffalo does seems to have Denver's number.  Back to the Super Bowl, how did ya like the halftime show?  I kinda liked Madanna, but the black rapper chicks, flippin the bird and stuff, coulda done without.   And where were the wardrobe malfuntions."
664202,Billy Bob,2012-02-07 00:02:00,5865,I knew nothing about Madonna but I watched the half time show....she's in GREAT shape for a 53 year old women but I don't care for her music....I'm a 70's music guy with a wife who's trying to get me to like country music...LOL  The black childish girl (M.I.A.) needs to be taught a good lesson.....like withhold her pay check for that stupid act...but the NFL loves this  because it's even more publicity for them....meaning even more $$$ down the line for the NFL.
664234,spud7378,2012-02-07 01:05:00,68,"the loss of a dozen shiners how embaresing, i am a die hard pats fan, but the giants outplayed them in the fourth! NE defence was poor as they have been all year! both O lines were dynamite and both QBS were bang on! great game"
664245,Cudz,2012-02-07 01:20:00,2652,BOTTOM LINE HE DROPPED THAT PASS    AND    WAIT FOR IT         THE NEW YORK GIANTS WON ! Lol.  Let's agree to disagree.  By the way I am in no way a pats fan and wanted the giants to win.
664248,Billy Bob,2012-02-07 01:27:00,5865, Cudz.......nice razzing with you buddy......at least there is one Canadian here that knows football....and I don't mean soccer....LOL...
663897,jedimaster,2012-02-06 02:58:00,3472,OMG WHat a finish. I love it when the PATS LOSE!!!!
663898,NAW,2012-02-06 03:01:00,4022,That's the most football I've watch in about 16 years..  Not a big fan.  But that was a bit of a nail bite'r at the end!
663900,jedimaster,2012-02-06 03:08:00,3472,I bet there are a few recievers on the block from new england. Some serious drops. Giants front 4 played pretty solid. They are the MVP of this game.
663901,Dan668,2012-02-06 03:13:00,1120,Love it when the Giants beat the pats. 90% of my friends are die hard Pat fans. It was an ok game.
663903,Rizzo,2012-02-06 03:20:00,4754,not a big fan but did watch a bit. That guy Weller? Welker cost the Pats the game with that dropped pass with a few minutes to go
663906,Sawyer,2012-02-06 03:24:00,48,Go Giants Go! I loved the game - the offense plays were very methodical and defense was solid on both ends.
663925,Cudz,2012-02-06 04:24:00,2652,"Nope.  He is arguably the best receiver in the league bar none.  He had more catches for more yards than any receiver this year.  He was one of the biggest reasons they made it that far.  Pass was a bit behind him but he is so athletic despite being way undersized that he makes a difficult catch look very catchable. IF he catches the ball it makes for a shorter hail mary to win, that is all.  Trust me he did not cost them the game.  I watch way too much football."
663926,skeeter99,2012-02-06 04:27:00,109,great outcome
663928,Nipfisher,2012-02-06 04:28:00,2449,HUGE Giants fan and Spud7378 owes me a dozen shiners. I'll have those delivered to my hut please.
663930,Cudz,2012-02-06 04:30:00,2652,"Are you kidding me? Ok there were some drops but the 2 you are talking about are Welker's and Hernandez.  Wes welker is arguably the number one receiver in the NFL.  If he was put on waivers EVERY team in the league would be lined up to pay him whatever he wanted.  Hernandez- Second year player and possibly the 3rd best tight end in the NFL behind Gronkowski, his teammate and maybe Gonzales.  I rank him above gates. Same scenario for him if he was ever released.  Not going to happen. It was an average game until the 4th quarter then it got good. NY outplayed NE. MVP or MVplay was manningham's catch.  Outstanding."
663932,uglyfish,2012-02-06 04:31:00,981,"Loved the giants win!! Nuthin better then seeing pretty boy, justin bieber wannabe, tom brady get the loss!! But, that was not a great game by the giants defense. They were kinda weak on pass coverage throughout the game, and the front 4, were solid, and made some good plays, but were not the MVP's, for them, they were really a non factor for most of the game."
663933,Dutchy,2012-02-06 04:33:00,416,"Pats didn't lose, the Giants went and won it. Wasn't a great game, but I am so glad the Pats lost."
663944,BillM,2012-02-06 05:26:00,17367,What a crappy game.  The last 5 mins was the most entertaining.
663945,registerfly,2012-02-06 05:32:00,198, And that catch relieved NE one of their time outs. Nonetheless fantastic catch. I called it weeks ago in the other thread. NE was going down.
663979,Rizzo,2012-02-06 13:05:00,4754," to me it did look quite catchable and I guess the broadcaster felt so too. I believe his quote was ""He catches that 100 out of 100 times"". Because I have no clue who Welker is, I'm basing my opinion on that one specific moment. If he catches that ball it has a huge influence on the game. The drive continues, and either they chew up a whole bunch more time or they get a td themself. Great for Welker for being the reason they got to the superbowl, but that miss was the turning point in my opinion."
663987,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 13:35:00,5865," The pass everyone here is referring to that Welker didn't make was NOT at the very end of the game but rather on their drive while the Pats were leading 17-15 and just over 4 minutes to play....that could of killed the clock for the Pats as the Giants only had 1 time out remaining. And it was no easy catch for any receiver but one you hope he does make....Did it cost the Pats the game....MANY think it probably did, include Wes Welker himself......take a good look here......  http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=lc-carpenter_wes_welker_drop_patriots_super_bowl_020512&active_dimension=carousel_coke_today&ysp_frm_woah=1  Bottom line when it came down to the 4th quarter and pressure was finally being applied to Brady, he quickly became a average QB and not the SUPER QB he normally is when he has all day in the pocket....does anyone here remember the first Bills vs Pats game in the begining of the season when Buffalo had everyone playing (Merriman)and could put a lot of pressure on Brady....he had 4 interceptions that day and that proved to be the reason they lost to the Buffalo Bills that day.  Cudz...you may watch way too much football, but not nearly as much as this Redneck....  Bob"
663990,Grimace,2012-02-06 13:39:00,2020,That broadcaster is Cris Collinsworth.  He has nothing good to say about anybody.  I was pulling for the Giants because I believe the NFC is far superior.  Brady had to throw that ball a bit behind him because if he led Welker up the field he would have been destroyed.  I really enjoyed the whole game.  That Manningham catch was unbelievable.  The one Cruz catch wear he jumped like 4 feet off the ground to grab the ball was awesome too.
663991,Grimace,2012-02-06 13:41:00,2020,I also loved the substitute teacher making an interception in the Super Bowl.  Great story.   That was very bad throw selection.
664034,jedimaster,2012-02-06 15:54:00,3472,"Clearly that one dropped pass was the turning point in the game. If that catch is made they burn the clock down. It was catchable. and when you drop a catchable pass in the superbowl with the clock winding down its hard to have that go un noticied. It was a good pass, and a good play. It was in his hands. He wasn't even entirely presured on the pass either. It will go down as the play that gave it away. Never mind the 50 yard miracle on the sidelines. It was that 25 yard dropped pass that will stand out to me that determined the game.  He had three guys around hime but none were even looking at him. he was in a pretty big pocket. I thin kbrady threw it a bit behind him, but that catch has to get made. That play was going for him from the snap. Brady didn't even fake or look anywhere accept at welker.  I am not saying he is bad, but that was a bad bad miss."
664051,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 16:29:00,5865," It was a play that ""could"" of made the difference in the game....but to say never mind the 50 yard miracle [pass] on the sidelines is silly to me....that CATCH did make the difference in the game....that CATCH was spectacular not only by the receiver (Mario Manningham) who made the catch but by Eli Manning that made the throw....it's plays like that, that stand out and EVERYONE remembers....  Wes Welker is a outstanding receiver for the Pats but I don't know if he can be consider a ""ELITE RECEIVER"" in the NFL....even ""IF"" he made that catch, it doesn't mean the Pats win the game....other things could of happened...like a forced fumble or another interception of a Brady pass...so to dwell on a ""could of"" instead of what ""DID"" happen doesn't do it for me....I have played, coached and watched this game far too long to count on something when there is over 4 minutes in the game to be played. Even 4 seconds left to play can hurt you badly in the NFL.  Bob"
664058,jedimaster,2012-02-06 16:56:00,3472,"That cath puts them on the 25 yard line or some wasn't it? 3 runs runs the clock down to likely the 2 minute warning plus a field goal. Sure nothing is certain but to give the ball back to the giants needing a touchdown to win, or a field goal to win is a completly different story. Yes they got the touch down in the end but its a completly different game if that catch is made. A sure thing? No."
664062,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 17:19:00,5865," If I remember correctly it was actually closer to the 20 yard line....but a play here or there also could have made the difference in just about any game....but ""most"" games are remembered for the PLAYS that WERE made and not the ones that were not......except for Super Bowl XXV when Scott Norwood missed a 47 yard field goal as time ran out that lost the game for the Buffalo Bills back in January '91....but if you remember correctly no fans blamed Scott Norwood directly for losing that game either....as the Bills could of made a play here or there that ""could of"" made a difference in the game....at the HUGE pep rally in Buffalo when the Bills returned home THOUSANDS of Bills Fans cheered on for Scott Norwood when he finally took the stage and said a few words to the crowd....  But as Tom Brady said yesterday ""I would much rather lose this game then not play this game all together"".....The 1990 - 1991 - 1992 and 1993 Buffalo Bills will always live in my heart as one of the GREATEST teams ever (the only NFL team to go to 4 Super Bowl Games in a row)....I don't blame Norwood for the lose....but I do wish he made that difficult kick..."

Wes Walker never draws double coverage from any team like a ELITE Receiver does game in and game out....not don't take me wrong....he's a top NFL receiver but not a ELITE Receiver.....don't believe me take a look how he is rated by experts.  http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82036e05/article/grab-bag-games-best-wrs-ride-firstround-pedigree  We'll soon see how good the rest of the NFL ranks Welker as he's a free agent and should draw some nice offers....but not a ELITE Receiver offer if I might guess.
