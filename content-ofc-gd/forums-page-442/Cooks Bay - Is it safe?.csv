664890,d_paluch,2012-02-09 14:16:00,343,Lowest I saw was about 8 inches. Its safe but as always be careful.
664893,Fish Farmer,2012-02-09 14:22:00,2234,"All I can say Buck, the hut operators are out. Don't go on weekends, to may people. There catching lots of dinks. There was a crack to step over at shore, but not a problem. Mite want to try Virgina beach or Bolster for bigger Perch. Just always be careful."

664923,DaveMc,2012-02-09 15:18:00,89," lots of fish caught between sunday and now between peninsula resort and bolster, 30ish FOW look for the rough pack ice"

664971,frozen-fire,2012-02-09 17:44:00,542,I was out two weeks ago on Cooks Bay and it was safe. I would assume that the ice is even thicker now. But as always... play it safe.
664984,Fisherman,2012-02-09 18:43:00,7201,"I was out this morning from 715 to 10, lots of ice, slick like pike snot, bring cleats or wear golf shoes.  The bite was non stop, caught over a hundred, kept 20 for supper.  There's a little bump at the shoreline, the rest is okay."
