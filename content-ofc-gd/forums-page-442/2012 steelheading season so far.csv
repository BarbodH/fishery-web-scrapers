664486,misfish,2012-02-07 23:49:00,29133,"Or you can just click on the pic icon (insert image) and place the copied in.   Some real nice fish,and ya,that water it be ripp,n."
664487,BillM,2012-02-07 23:53:00,17367," When you're logged into your Photobucket account and put your mouse over one of the pics a little box will pop up.  You want to click the IMG Code heading above the last box..  This will copy the code for you, then all you have to do is paste it into your thread."
664517,NAW,2012-02-08 01:45:00,4022,Interesting choice if reels.  Is that an old school Shimano FX2000 rear drag?
664524,mikeseb,2012-02-08 02:07:00,201," Close! haha its an old shimano R4000 with the bottom drag.  Sadly her time may be up though, the other day when fighting a fish it was making some pretty weird grinding noises from the crank and it has quite a bit of play to it.  Ill really miss that reel, tons of great memories.  If anyone has any advice on repairs please let me know as I really enjoy using this reel and dont wanna see it ""retire"".  I think the bearing are gone in it"
664556,ironstone74,2012-02-08 04:08:00,201,Nice fish man!  Paul
664564,Brad W.,2012-02-08 04:46:00,2,"I may be missing something, but Bronte is closed until ""Opener"" rolls around.  Those pictures make it easy to recognize the locations, and posing with out-of-season fish isn't the best thing to do on a public forum.  My apologies if I am wrong on which body of water you are fishing, or timing.  Just trying to prevent you from being fined, and losing all your new equipment."
664567,mikeseb,2012-02-08 05:05:00,201,"Hey Brad,  I would never do something as stupid as fishing an out of season body of water nor would I be even dumber to post a report about it. lol Those fish are from a river that is open ALL year round for fishing.  I am sure there are a few guys on the forum that can back me up and correctly identify the location by the background of the pictures but there is no need to publicly give away where exactly Im fishing if its 100% legal.  Although I wish bronte was open I wouldn't mind saving an extra couple bucks on gas lol but o well learning new body's of water and how they differ from others is one of the things I really enjoy about fishing.  Mike"
664569,Brad W.,2012-02-08 05:20:00,2,"Thanks for clarifying, Mike.  You can understand how closely it resembles the other, closed body of water.  Nice pictures."
664794,hurraylien,2012-02-09 01:34:00,95,as far as your reel goes i would opt for a top drag rather than bottom.much smoother.i recently bought a pflueger president 6730 for 70 dollars very smooth reeling and a nice drag many have said best reel for under a hundred dollars.you will notice a huge difference from the rear drag system when fighting larger fish.if you really want that one fixed just take it to a shimano dealer they should be able to get you parts
