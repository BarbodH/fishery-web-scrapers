664516,Slayingm,2012-02-08 01:45:00,204,In so much has it has been a brutal yearr for ice this year so far the conditions on the North Eastern sections of L. Simcoe are good and have had done lots of trips out there the past few weeks. This past weekend I had another group of clients out from Michigan for Perch and Perch we caught!  Although conditions Changed from Sat to Sun the weather was still rather stable and the fish co-operated in depths between 28 to 32 ft. Because of the lack of snow on the ice and hence brighter condition's below the fish were really relating to hard/soft bottom transitions and also stacked ice piles in the lake. Sections of the lake where ice had broke and piled up offered a shadow below and concentrated good quality fish. Some of the Jumbo's we caught were coughing up baby gobies up to 3 inches long and others crayfish and shiners.  Small hammered spoons in Blue/Silver and Gold/Orange combo's tipped with a 1/2 minnow tail produced as well as #2 and #3 Rapala ice jigs in the white/chart and Firetiger patterns. We used 2lb Sufix Fluorocarbon and seemed to make a huge difference in getting bit as many guys were moving all day to find fish. We caught ton's of big fish both Sat and Sun and would hate to even guess at the number landed as it would be in the hundreds for sure. Good electronics were key to find the transitions and also watch fish respond and work your jig to entice them to hit.  Here is just a couple of pics of some of the size of fish were got over the weekend.  Your's truly with a couple of nice ones:   Jason from Michigan with his 1st reel Simcoe 'Pig'!   Be safe out there and good fish'n... Greg.
