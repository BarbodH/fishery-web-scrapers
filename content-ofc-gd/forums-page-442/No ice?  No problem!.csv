664341,BillM,2012-02-07 12:39:00,17367,"It's mid February and I should be 15 miles out on Simcoe laying a beating on the whities.  Well as everyone knows there's no ice out there   Now don't get me wrong I don't mind fishing Kemp, but the crowds are out of control and it's not very peaceful when all I hear all day are people constantly yapping back and forth..  So I decided to see if I could get lucky with a really small window I saw opening up yesterday..  It definitely paid off...  By the time I left the river was up again and on the verge of unfishable..    "

664374,wallacio,2012-02-07 15:15:00,475,Nicely done bud!  Do I know the river???
664376,BillM,2012-02-07 15:24:00,17367," No, it's a secret spot you've never been to!   LOL!!!"
664385,Rod Caster,2012-02-07 16:17:00,5784," Sure, but not as cute as a ling.  Good going Bill. Sounds like you had a great weekend of fishing. If only we had rivers like that around here..."
664396,frozen-fire,2012-02-07 16:53:00,542,We were contemplating hitting it after Simcoe as well LOL.  We figured we already had all the ice stuff and thought there would be thick ice in the slower sections of the river... but I'm guessing it's completely ice free?
664445,Oggie,2012-02-07 19:23:00,588,Great minds think alike Bil. I did the same thing yesterday. Awesome success for any time of year!   I never seem to remember to take pics. Dan O.
