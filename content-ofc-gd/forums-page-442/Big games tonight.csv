Ottawa is down 2-1 right now and Toronto has looked like the better team over the past 5 games.  For the record I'm cheering for the Jets. I'm predicting 5-3 Jets tonight.    "
664526,mikeseb,2012-02-08 02:13:00,201,"Jets and leafs has been a good 1 so far.  How bout them leafs playing like a playoff-worthy team the last few games?  Too bad burkie doesnt have any big trades planned for this months deadline, we could defiantly use a bit of extra fire power off the wing."
664534,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-08 02:45:00,10439,"I also root for the Jets, but only when they aren't playing the Leafs.  In fact I have 7th row seats on the Jets blue line in Tampa on March 31st.  "

664553,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-08 03:58:00,10439, I'll probably succumb to heat stroke as soon as the planes door is opened. Hopefully I will forget about the heat as soon as I stick my first tarpon.
664560,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-08 04:15:00,2690,"You have to love the Winnipeg fans. I'm a Leafs fan all the way, but, the stuffed shirts at the ACC should take some lessons."
