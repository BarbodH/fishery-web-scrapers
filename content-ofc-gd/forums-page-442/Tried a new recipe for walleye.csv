TRY IT!!!!!!  It's really easy to make...  Just cut your walleye into bite size chunks... Wrap the chunks with a 1/3-1/2 peice of bacon... Put the wrapped chunks on toothpicks or scewers (sp)... And I put some of Mercmans BBQ sauce on em... Bake at 350 for 20-30 minutes....  Very tasty treat...

664937,bobowski,2012-02-09 16:14:00,360,My mouth is watering. I have some Perch in the freezer that I think  will try this recipe with.
664939,mercman,2012-02-09 16:17:00,7054,With the secret dipping sauce!!!!!!nummy nummy  
664946,Rod Caster,2012-02-09 16:27:00,5784,Looks tasty Mike. Maybe that's the recipe to try with Ling
664947,mike rousseau,2012-02-09 16:29:00,4661," i have no need to ""save"" my walleye... i have an endless year round supply... there is only a 6-8 week stretch when i cant get ""fresh"" walleye cause the season is closed...  i pretty much only eat walleye... dont really like bass... and perch are too much work....."
664948,mike rousseau,2012-02-09 16:31:00,4661,"the key was a nice sweet BBQ sauce....  Mercman sells the stuff i used... ""Cattle Boyz"""
