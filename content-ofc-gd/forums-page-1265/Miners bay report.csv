38437,jeffw,2007-02-22 21:57:00,267,I took out my sisters boyfriend today as he had never icefished before. We got to miners bay at 10 is and fished till 4:30. We were fishing in about 70ft and ended up catching two in the slot with a ton of misses. All fish were caught on a swivel split shot and a large minnow. Cheers Jeff
