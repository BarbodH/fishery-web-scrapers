37732,tomO,2007-02-21 21:52:00,363,"I'm looking for a new box,any one have an SKB tacklebox? Also check out the megabass asylum boxes. I don't know how to post a link."
37891,tomO,2007-02-22 01:00:00,363,no one
37897,camillj,2007-02-22 01:07:00,1988,Planos all the way for me now ... got at least a dozen of em ... and soft bags to carry em in (4 at a time) . I'll never go back to the big bulky tackle boxes
37900,MJL,2007-02-22 01:12:00,2427," Totally agree.  I haven't used a tackle box in quite a number of years.  The only thing they were good for was for sitting on.  Beyond that, Planos all the way.  Way more versatile than any box."
37904,tomO,2007-02-22 01:17:00,363,"I like a box to put other things in besides tackle, flash lite and some tools and such."
37911,camillj,2007-02-22 01:22:00,1988,I use soft (small) gym type tote-bags for that stuff ... got 3 in my trunk mosta the time ... one with warm (dry) clothes ... one with miscellaneous tools and flashlights and rope etc. and one with all the 'bulkier' fishing type stuff that wont go into a Plano.
37935,OhioFisherman,2007-02-22 01:45:00,6623,"Tackle bags for me too, easier to carry, easier to load with tackle for a specific species just take out some boxes and plug in others."
37951,Weeds,2007-02-22 02:03:00,782,"Not the answer for everyone I know but I've been buying toolboxes at Canadian Tire and using them as tackleboxes myself. A small plastic one around 12-14 inches long with 2 trays trays and see thru flip up lid is cheap, light, seemingly durable and when you fill it up you just buy another. If I remember correctly they cost like 6 bucks or something. Buy one for each species.  Probably room for about 1349 Trout flies or 7 or 8 musky lures in each one."
37963,tomO,2007-02-22 02:15:00,363,I was lookin at the bags but was wondering if they stained up easily and would maybe start smelling bad.
37972,pidge,2007-02-22 02:25:00,438,"I've had mine for a few years now and dont notice a smell, but it stays in the garage all the time. One thing with bags I have noticed is if you plan on doing alot of walking they are killer on the shoulder. I'm forever having to switch arms. Just my 2 cents."
37982,MJL,2007-02-22 02:34:00,2427,"I just stick my plano boxes into an old school backpack or a hiking pack depending on what I'm carrying.  If it gets dirty, I spray it down with a hose and hang it in the yard to dry."
37997,camillj,2007-02-22 02:56:00,1988,Yep .. the bags are a bit of a pain in the rain...gotta leave em open to dry out afterwards ... but then I normally only take the bags on the trip (in the car) but dump a couple planos into the cooler for on the boat ... especially now that theres all that room since we dont take beer out anymore
38018,Blake,2007-02-22 03:16:00,418,"Check out the new Shimano tackle bags.  Rain and waterproof.  These will also float if dropped overboard with up to 40lbs of tackle or gear in them.  Finally a bag that is truly waterproof, easy to clean and floats."
38034,camillj,2007-02-22 03:26:00,1988,Sweet .. and I think I got a few BPS $$ to spend ...
38552,tomO,2007-02-23 00:58:00,363,I'll do that Blake. Thx to all
