37903,brifishrgy,2007-02-22 01:16:00,559,My cousin and I made it out this am on the lower grand .. ice didnt look too good but after puching a cuple holes in the ice decided to head out ..... after away from the ramp area the ice was ok to the left but the ice to the right appeared broken/refrozen ... a half hour in Mike had a beauty rainbow on ... 10-15 min fight and lost it at the hole ... couldnt get his head up ... left the ice at around noon ... the ice was making some not so nice sounds and was starting to heave by the ramp ... cracks starting to grow ... if your heading out there this weekend bring a boat ... I dont think there will be any access from the ramp
37956,joonmoon,2007-02-22 02:10:00,528,The warm will prolly wash away the safe ice. If its startin to make noises already then pcs will begin to break off and it will refreeze at night. The overall structure will become weaker and if you put a pile of guys out there this weekend then you could have a recipe for disaster. Be careful out there everyone...and you sure won't see me out there when its like that.
