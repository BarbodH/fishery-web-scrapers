37481,Castmaster,2007-02-21 15:29:00,86,Daylight savings has been extended one month for 2007 and hopefully permanantly. Sweet folks! Days are gonna be longer in 18 more days! http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=77
37515,taper,2007-02-21 16:32:00,611,I thought I had heard the US had approved this but Canada had not . Does any one know for sure.
37530,tonyb,2007-02-21 16:43:00,1637,Canada is on board.  It has caused a heck of a lot of work for us patching servers in time for March 11th  Kinda like the millennium bug that was supposed to cause computers to act up.  Tony
37531,Dartee,2007-02-21 16:44:00,47,Yup its true...more daylight to fish after work  March 11 and Nov 4 this year  Could you imagine the confusion with a +/- of 1hr  north/south .
37706,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 21:09:00,1780,The old biological clock is going to be messed up.
37722,huntervasili,2007-02-21 21:29:00,1604,Fishing time is fishing time... Good idea in my books... I can always use an extra hour of daylight
37753,walleyejigger,2007-02-21 22:13:00,876,"is it just me or do u find that more daylight later in the day makes u feel more upbeat, early winter when it's dark around 5oclock or so is somewhat depressing,  just thinking of having daylight passed 9 oclock this summer puts a big smile on my face"
37785,Greencoachdog,2007-02-21 22:50:00,8163,Well I for one despise daylight savings time!!! I'd rater have the extra time in the morning and not have to mess with setting the clocks back and forth. They need to leave it one way or the other all the time!!!
37818,Beans,2007-02-21 23:39:00,3339,I agree with you dawg...why don't they just put the clocks ahead 1/2 an hour and leave it at that...
37822,Bernie,2007-02-21 23:45:00,3190,The extra time in the evening is so nice.   A little extra fishing time after work is great. Its a little tougher to get going in the morning when its dark but....
37852,Rich Clemens,2007-02-22 00:22:00,3131,It's nice not to not go to work in the dark and then get home in the dark ... that stinks.   Looking forward to the evening daylight now.  Temps warming up.  Groundhog says spring will come early.  BRING IT ON.
37866,camillj,2007-02-22 00:35:00,1988,Cant we just move em ahead a couple months and get straight into Spring
