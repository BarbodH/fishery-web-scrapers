37184,Gail,2007-02-21 00:21:00,7,]It was a nice warm day so I pulled the boys out of school at lunch time and let them have a little outdoor education instead!!! Drilled a few holes. It wasn't long before we all had a pike or two. not very big but a lot of fun!!!    
37186,urbanangler1990,2007-02-21 00:24:00,933,"cool, wish i could fish with my mom, she hates it..."
37188,lew,2007-02-21 00:28:00,12767," Reading, writing and pike fishing.........now THATS an education !!"

37193,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 00:35:00,1780," Ye, and during school to boot.  Very nice fish."
37195,irishfield,2007-02-21 00:40:00,26272,Great stuff tmf !
37217,sonny,2007-02-21 01:04:00,511,Talk about one kewl mommy
37242,Rizzo,2007-02-21 01:29:00,4754,"good stuff.  My first time ice fishing was on that lake.  Nice little spot, pike aren't too big but quite accomodating."
37252,glirw,2007-02-21 01:37:00,200,"You must live on that lake , because last time I checked there was no public access onto it , unless you walked ...... ? Please do tell !  Nice pike by the way , and welcome aboard!"
37421,Rich Clemens,2007-02-21 11:24:00,3131,Hey that's great and I'll bet the kids loved it.   I'll have to give mom a call and see if she'll pull me out of work some day and let me go fishing.
37569,woodro,2007-02-21 17:59:00,168,"grilw is correct, there is no access onto this lake without trespassing, unless of course you do own some private property surrounding the entire lake.  Your last name would be Lebovic and therefore we would be related."
37628,cityfisher,2007-02-21 19:55:00,959, I live 10 mins from bond and there is no access unless you have lakefront property.  I fished there many years ago and got some mini pike too...Nice catch
37662,Clausewitz,2007-02-21 20:35:00,19,"Nice pics, thanks."
37711,kemper,2007-02-21 21:12:00,2232,"My dad used to pull me out of school quite a bit when I was in grade school, and I loved it every time!  I remember once the principal asked him where we were going and he said, ""My son and I have an appointment with some fish."""
37840,glirw,2007-02-22 00:10:00,200," lol woodro , your post made me chuckle. Are they building a religious centre around that lake ? If so that would be pretty sweet , unfortunately for them there is no Carp in that lake though , or maybe there is ."
38033,Master of Bait,2007-02-22 03:25:00,196,Awesome move MOM!  Those kids must've been so happy!  Can't put a value on that kind of quality time.  School's great but I'm sure they learned twice as much out there than in the classroom for an afternoon...
38073,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-22 04:23:00,0,"Good for you  Nice report, thanks for sharing."
