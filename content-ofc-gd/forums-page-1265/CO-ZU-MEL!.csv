I'd love to get into some predators ('cuda?) with lures in the lagoons/beach areas and then some smaller stuff with bait and small hooks on the bottom.  Just wondering if anyone has any tips as to what to bring and use.  I haven't got much experience with this stuff.  We're staying on the southwest side of the island.  Any experiences or suggestions shared are welcome.  Thanks."

A perfect pair would be a medium heavy 8 - 10 foot spining rod and reel (I just use my Stradic 4000 and a steelhead rod) with 30 lb power pro. A heavier outfit is recommended as well.  I just bought a nice outfit for this purpose:  Daiwa BG 30 reel (80 bucks US) and Shakespeare Salmon/Steelhead Ugly Stil Lite-Heavy power 8.5 ' spinning rod (medium fast action with heavy power-60 bucks US) from Cabelas.  AND/OR a medium heavy casting outfit with a long rod with lots of backbone.  As for lures bring an assortment of plugs, jigs, spoons, jerkbaits and some terminal tackle for live bait. Rapala's are always nice, just be sure to switch out the split rings and freshwater hooks for beefier ones.  If you really want to have fun bring a good quality (Petzl or similar) headlamp and do some night fishing from shore.  Good Luck"

36857,cityfisher,2007-02-20 14:54:00,959,i went to cozumel last year and had a great time....i brought my gear with me  but since my resort was on east side south of downtown .. NO FISHING IS PERMITTED... rent a car and investigate the shoreline...  p.s the west side of the island gets hit hard with huge waves so its basically impossible to fish from shore.
36945,bucktail,2007-02-20 18:23:00,1857,Don't forget to pack a glove for handling spiny and semi venomous fish that you might catch.
36995,gotfish,2007-02-20 19:51:00,53,If you cannot find much close to where you are staying. Take the ferry over to Playa del Carman ($20 return) And Grab a cab for $10 to Porto Adventura. The opperator there is Captain Ricks and he offers a wide variety of fishing adventures. Do a search I am sure he has a web site. I was there three weeks ago and his guides put us on some nice cudas. make sure to ask him about light gear fishing.
37043,mepps,2007-02-20 21:13:00,1301,"I love cuda fishing, you dont need anything too heavy.  Make sure you have leaders!  here are my top 3 cuda lures:  white GULP sinking minows   Silver spoons   X-raps   fast retrieves are key!  Make sure you wash the salt out of your reels after each use as well!"
37250,Rizzo,2007-02-21 01:35:00,4754,"c'mon clive, them cudas are bait  either way I'm jealous!  Have fun in Cozumel"
37310,mepps,2007-02-21 03:12:00,1301,"Tarpon are my specialty, not cudas  The big cudas are few and far between in the BVI"
37311,Crazyhook,2007-02-21 03:13:00,1154,"Cozumel! fished there a whole bunch. most of my fishing was done off the docks where the cruiseships dock. Never had any problems at all. IF you are int flats fishing check out isla de punta ( sp) loads of permit and bonefish around there. Small white hair jigs will do the trick. As for cudas, rapalas or yozuris have worked for me as well as any small live fish,,,  if you venture out on a charter get an American guide, they care if you catch and will not screw you Carlos and Charlies!!!"
38041,Master of Bait,2007-02-22 03:35:00,196,"Hey guys,  Thanks very much for the help.  I know I'll only have the opportunity to get out for several short periods as I am alone with the wife but I may sneak out on a charter if the price is right.  This is great info for me.  I'll make sure to post reports and pics when I get back!"
