37392,nautifish,2007-02-21 05:15:00,1416,Are we allowed to do our own personal T-shirts with OFC Community Team # on it? & wear that in the picture?
37412,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-21 09:28:00,621," Not sure about being Rich,but I am sure all 6 foot plus of you will look so sweet  Fishergirl, sparkles might just make him look pretty swell  Only thing Gbay,we are not calling ourselves Team Lipstick for your cause   This has been funny"

37864,xrap,2007-02-22 00:35:00,683,Is it to late to join?
37969,fishergirl72,2007-02-22 02:18:00,455,No X-Rap it's not just let Rick know that you are intrested.
38007,xrap,2007-02-22 03:05:00,683,"Hey rick, I'm intrested!"
38020,ccmtcanada,2007-02-22 03:18:00,7971, Hey xrap...you gotta go to this thread and read the rules and post that you're interested there.  Here's the link....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1634
38102,charlied,2007-02-22 05:12:00,584,ya he is there and so am I....just waiting to be put on a team.
38239,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-22 15:35:00,621,"  Might have a fight on your hands,Gbay has his mind set  I think all pics should be submitted with a lipstick in it  I can just see it now ""Honey can I borrow your lipstick"" ""What for?"" ""Oh its for this fishing contest I am in "" Oh sure!!!!!! ""Would you like to borrow my stilettos with that"" Would you mind?  At the end of the year we throw all the sticks in and hand it over to the winning team  Rick and John,thanks ,I needed something to go off on The lipstick cup as them linning up at the doors!  "
38250,fishergirl72,2007-02-22 15:48:00,455,"Well Marc my beloved brand is Glam shine so as long as the cup is filled with that I'm in.LOL  GBay would look so pretty and sparkly, actually that shine it gives might attract the fish to the boat.LOL   Thanks Marc I needed a laugh at this time."
38364,douG,2007-02-22 19:34:00,2693," I like the taste of lipgloss, fishergirl, but not out of the applicator.  That's just gross."
38524,fishergirl72,2007-02-23 00:13:00,455,LOL at Doug
36765,Greencoachdog,2007-02-20 10:12:00,8163,...
36841,ehg,2007-02-20 14:20:00,2666,"The tourney thread doesn't show up on 'General Discussion' page i think people might be missing it.  Hope to get out Sunday or so to start contributing. Seems laid back enough this year.  cheers,  ehg"
36850,tonyb,2007-02-20 14:29:00,1637,"Indeed, I posted in the sticky thread about the teams, and who is on what team.  I guess it doesn't really matter yet, just keep track of anything you catch.  Tony"
36866,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 15:17:00,3382,"As was stated teh team and captains selection will be today. Look for the captains list to appear around 6 Pm and then the team random draw will take place around 8 PM. Results of the draw will be in the chat room and on the toruney thread. Once the draw is done, a new section will appear in the tourney area forum."
37023,GbayGiant,2007-02-20 20:31:00,1780,"Cool Rick. No more ice fishing for this guy, I'll contribute to my team starting May, can't wait.  Where do you get the OFC hats ?"
37055,huntervasili,2007-02-20 21:29:00,1604,Hehe... maybe I will have some luck at the BOQ and get started early
37110,irishfield,2007-02-20 23:15:00,26272," The way I read the rules...TJ's OFC clothing won't cut it this year, has to be an OFC Community logo in the picture."
37121,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 23:26:00,3382,Not the logo..just something with OFC Community.com on it. Write it in lipstick or whatever is handy. On a napkin or on some masking tape with a marker.
37128,irishfield,2007-02-20 23:34:00,26272,"'tis what I meant Rick..just couldn't come up with a better word than Logo. OFC clothing is no longer an acceptable picture ""marker""...as this is no longer OFC"
37132,GbayGiant,2007-02-20 23:37:00,1780," I was always wondering about the hats, just to meet others from the board if they see the hat, they know what's up  But if that doesn't work for the tourney, I'll just pull the lipstick out of my purse like Rick suggested."
37185,Greencoachdog,2007-02-21 00:21:00,8163,...
37197,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-21 00:41:00,621,"So Gbay,you run with lip stick do ya eh!"
37202,bigfish1965,2007-02-21 00:49:00,3382,"I think you can take a piece of paper and write OFC COmmunity.com wayyyy faster than your printer can spit this out, but anyway...because you asked. "
37205,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 00:52:00,1780," Hahaha, only when I play dress up."
37209,sonny,2007-02-21 00:57:00,511,How do i get on a team???
37222,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-21 01:10:00,621, Get some lipstick
37226,irishfield,2007-02-21 01:15:00,26272,"I'll bring some for you, when I come to Quebec Marc! What colour do you prefer.  Sonny...find the ""sign up and rules"" thread and reply there."
37232,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-21 01:20:00,621," No thats quite alright Wayne,ya might wanna ask Gbay which colour he prefers and mail him some Might wanna ask him if he prefers Fabergey or L'Oreal  hahahahahahaha  Boy I remember a day when a man carried a pen around,now they carry lipstick bwahahahahahahah"
37248,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 01:33:00,1780," I'll take a hot pink.  Maybe FISHERGIRL, a I can come up with a lipstick sent for baits to market."
37260,Greencoachdog,2007-02-21 01:53:00,8163,...
37285,fishergirl72,2007-02-21 02:44:00,455," LOL   Well I can certainly help you out in that department. I have about 12 different shades of sparkly lipgloss, so take your pick, just give it back to me after you are done with it.LOL"
37308,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 03:10:00,1780,

37318,knotaclue,2007-02-21 03:18:00,136,"i missed everything about it ,is it to late to get in ?"
37319,irishfield,2007-02-21 03:19:00,26272,I think Rick was just cleaning out those whom he'd already put on teams to start the thread fresh for newcomers. Try again UB1990 on the rules and sign up thread.
