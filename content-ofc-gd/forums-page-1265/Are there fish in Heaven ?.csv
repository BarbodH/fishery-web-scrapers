37992,camillj,2007-02-22 02:49:00,1988,I just had a really strange thought .. re-reading the thread on 2 favourite people to fish with .. and didnt wanna hijack it ...  Anyhow ... all those folks we remember (dearly departed) who inspire(d) so many of us to fish ... must be smiling at us from heaven ... pole in hand ... and then I had to stop and wonder .... if there are fish in Heaven .... an if so what did the fish have to do to get there
38027,Grimace,2007-02-22 03:20:00,2020,I hope so.  But I am gonna catch as many as I can here just incase
38029,Joey,2007-02-22 03:21:00,9122,"Well I'm sure there are fish in heaven, and its those damned suspended ones too!  Joey"
38032,ccmtcanada,2007-02-22 03:24:00,7971,I think maybe all the C&Rs that didn't make it down here are up there....and of course all the HUGE ones that died of natural causes!!! WOO HOO!!! There must be some biguns up there!!!
38051,TJQ,2007-02-22 03:51:00,7806, LOL.. good one.
38058,Bernie,2007-02-22 03:58:00,3190,I hope they are not too easy to catch...Take all the fun out of it
38061,Victor,2007-02-22 04:02:00,1609,if that's the case i better make sure i have all my gear with me ...
38062,MJL,2007-02-22 04:03:00,2427,"There's fish in heaven.  Which fish wouldn't want to be caught by great anglers like Izaak Walton, Lee Wulff, Ted Knot and countless numbers of great anglers and people from the past?  To the fish, it would be a privilege."
38064,MJL,2007-02-22 04:09:00,2427, I've been told that there's a whole stretch of tackle shops in heaven that sell gear at prices cheaper than Cabelas and carp gear without customs or import tax on them
38067,Golfisher,2007-02-22 04:17:00,586,"If there is no fish in Heaven, I don't wanna go there."
38071,camillj,2007-02-22 04:21:00,1988,A little ditty ... for Eric Clapton ...  oooh would ya bite my ba-a-ait ... if I saw you in heaven  and ooooh would it be the sa-a-ame ... if I caught you in heaven  minnows taste good  all the flies are food  and the 10 inch jakes ... all get follows ... here in heaven !
