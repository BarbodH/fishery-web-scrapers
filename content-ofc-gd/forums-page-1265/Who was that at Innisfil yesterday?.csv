I was driving (leading another car) to Innisfil beach park yesterday when I noticed a black pickup truck (can't remember the make, definitely a US maker) in front of me with a jumla sticker in the bottom left corner of the cab and an OFC sticker in the bottom right corner of the cab. It was about 10:30 am right near the park, but then whoever it was turned into the dollar store. Since I was leading another car, I didn't want to confuse the other car, I didn't follow the truck into the dollar store parking lot.  I tried to see if the truck parked after I got to parking lot at the park, but I didn't see it.  Anyways, I would like to say hello and sorry I missed greeting you there.  Oh, and yes, I did get skunked again on Simcoe, but it was a nice day out!  Stan (HearingFish)"

38303,wuchikubo,2007-02-22 17:22:00,1114,"Hey Misfish,  It was my first time out on the west side, not that it should matter much, fish just don't like to be around me!!! I felt sorry for the other guys that went with me, one guy got a little dinky perch while the other got skunked as well.  I wished someone would've helped me out there but even the Greg Klatt got skunked with my last outing with him!!  I guess that does it, no one else will wanna fish with me now!  HearingFish"
