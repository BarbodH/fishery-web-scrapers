37455,TJQ,2007-02-21 14:05:00,7806,  That my friend...  is the second story... LOLOL  BTW.. I can clan a boneless pike in half the time it takes me to do a pickerel...
37458,Rattletrap2,2007-02-21 14:06:00,1652,"I have always used the ""5 fillet"" method and it works well. The video method looks interesting too, and I might give it a try. Pike are excellent eating fishand if cleaned properly, are a real treat. In most of the lakes, Pike are over populated and are decimating other fish stocks. I prefer to keep them in the 3 pound size. More meat, but still not too large or old.  Any time we want a fish fry, it is usually Pike we go for. Clampets link shows the method I use."
37460,Headhunter,2007-02-21 14:20:00,5703,"Pike caught through the ice are excellent table fair! I'm usually pretty cautious when the water gets warmer, but I really do enjoy a feed of pike. HH"
37462,ryanheritage,2007-02-21 14:36:00,180,"Wow!! I guess I have been missing out. Its funny cause as soon as the season opens for pike and pickerel at my lake I can't keep the pike off my line. They are an every second cast fish, that I enjoy because they are great fighters even when they are only about 12-24 inches. In early spring we use top water for some unstopable action and it never even occurred to eat one cause I have been told they are fishy and bony. Now I am itching to get out and catch a few and fry em up. I guess a pike fish fry is in order this spring........."
37464,Headhunter,2007-02-21 14:44:00,5703,"If you find that the Pike are tasting ""overly fishy"", simply soak the fillets in milk for a coupla of hours in the fridge and most of the ""fisheyness"" will be gone! HH"
37594,Entropy,2007-02-21 18:44:00,747,just cause it smells bad doesn't mean you shouldn't eat it.
37609,Tdel,2007-02-21 19:24:00,393,"Pike is great for a meal.  To cut down on the fishy taste when caught in the summer I don't use all of the belly meat.  Some people give the belly to their kids or wife because there are no bones.  I take off the skin and remove the belly and the fishy taste is cut down a lot.  If it is early spring, winter or fall and the water is cold I like to leave the skin on and sometimes cook up the boneless belly meat.  Tom"
37656,Tacklebuster,2007-02-21 20:30:00,303,"I think Pike are excellent eating, perhaps one of my fav's.  I thought I would also add this pike cleaning link, which I think is the best I have seen so far.  Some of you probably already seen this one, its in French, but the video is quite detailed so you dont really need audio, in case you dont speak French.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-32gVbaXDg"
37683,Puckhead,2007-02-21 20:54:00,377, Please do tell me what sport fish isn't on your fav list...
37712,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-21 21:12:00,2050,yepp - the old man hated cleaning them but I made him keep me hammer handles all my life...now that I live down south I've gotta figure out how to clean them myself!  UF
38118,JerseyDog,2007-02-22 06:56:00,190,"I agree with many of the above - pike out of super cold water/ice is my fave and better than walleye. IMHO.  I don't keep summer pike, but I've prepared a few gut hooked bass that were pretty swampy and a good soak in cold water for a while helps to get the grassiness out of them."
37292,Garyv,2007-02-21 02:49:00,547,"Compare to Walleye pike has a firmer flesh and if within reasonable size and caught out of cool to colder water is excellent eating.  The trick is to fillet out the bones.  Years ago when Kevin Geray ( Anglers Kingdom ) had the television series ""Outdoor Encounters""  He put out a video and part of it was how to clean a pike easily while removing the bones.  I have the video but haven't watched it in years, now that your post has reminded me of it think I'll take a look again.  Look at his lodges website it may still be available.   One other guy that really knew how to fillet a Pike was Frank Yuhas a past owner of ""Five Mile Lake Lodge""  He did a segment on Cronzy's Ontario fisherman show in the early 90's that I also have on tape ( used to tape every one of Cronzy's shows back then).  Now I have two things to watch again.....Thanks for the post!"
37301,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 03:05:00,1780,"HAha, that's a good story T.J., at least there was absolutely no meat being wasted, maybe they should make some necklaces out of the teeth as well.  My grandpa showed me the cheek meat on Walleye, he always claimed it was the best, and I agree. If you guys don't eat the cheeks of Walleye, try it, it is extra lean."
37304,pikehunter,2007-02-21 03:07:00,1659,TJ.  How many beer did you consume before you ate   the pike heads?
37350,Jen,2007-02-21 03:46:00,833,"My uncle taught me to clean fish... this past summer I was fishing at his trailer with my son who caught his first pike...you have to eat the first real fish you catch... so I fillet it to everyones dismay... that was probably the best fish we have ever eatten... what a surprise... should have tried it years ago, but everyone always said, pike were not for eatting."
37446,Deano,2007-02-21 13:30:00,767,"Another way to eat pike and not lose any meat is to cut off head, tail and fins. Slice along the belly and remove entrails. Wash well and leave the skin on. The pike is now wrapped in foil with carrots and onions and spices of choice in the body cavity. Cook on BBQ or open fire turning once in 15 min. once cooked the fish will fall off the bones and the skin will be stuck to the foil. The carrots were used to absorb any fishy taste so don't eat them. But the fish will be great and you wont lose any meat that might be lost filleting."
37448,Gerritt,2007-02-21 13:42:00,6129,"I grew up eating Pike from Lake St. John, and my grandfather used to keep them whole as deano described.. only thing he would do different is add a couple slices of bacon to the belly and some lemon pepper...  I still have fond memories of watching that pike cooked over an open fire on a steel grate... man were those great times as a kid!!  I would eat pike anyday of the week especially if the pickeral bite is off. Infact I could batter and plate pike and a pickeral and I bet you wouldnt be able to tell the difference.   Gerritt."
37452,muskieb,2007-02-21 13:53:00,58,"The video Kennyman posted from youtube is how I clean the pike too.  I have not seen anyone clean a pike another way that produces a nicer fillet, or wastes less meat.  If you try this method, and get good at it the strip of meat with the bones in it will end up being not much thicker than the bones themselves.  The trick is a sharp knife, and to feel your way through the fillet, take your time and you will be very pleased with the result."
