But since I'm not familiar with the area, I'd like to ask for a little help on where I can park and walk out to do some ice fishing tommorrow morning.  If any OFNers are out, let me know, I'll try and swing by to say hello.  Thanks, Stan (HearingFish)"

A couple of friends and myself gave it a try near the huts in about 55 ft of water for a couple of hours without much success, unfortunately I missed my artic warrior flag go up as I was helping one of the guys understand the aqua vu, too late when I got the the rod.  I'll have to try BBP next time.  Thanks again, Stan"
