37727,~CK~,2007-02-21 21:46:00,30,"I think it may have been before the board changed over to OFC, but there was a thread where ppl showed off their lure collections.. one guy had built some shelves (made of that metal/wire stuff- the kind of shelves they use for closets, fridges, etc.) and had all his lures hanging from the wires.. sorry I don't remember who it was..  If anyone remembers the name of the thread or can find me the pic again, plz, I would really appreciate it..  trying to come up with something to organize all the fishing gear, lures, etc. a bit better and I thought it was a great idea.  Thanks!  ~CK~"
37729,huntervasili,2007-02-21 21:47:00,1604,Well I have a suggestion but not the pic your looking for. A large piece of cork board works well to heep all sorts of lures stored...
37730,~CK~,2007-02-21 21:51:00,30,"Thanks, I thought of that too, but something with shelf space would be more appropriate for the space I am working with and the amount of ""stuff"" needed to be organized. I am thinking along the lines of one of those closet organizer thingys? Maybe someone has some more knowledge/experience with this? I have to fit a lot of stuff into not a lot of space. lol."
37797,irishfield,2007-02-21 23:05:00,26272,That was pigeontroller I believe...had his musky baits hanging above the laundry tub while his wife was out shopping....
37800,Roy,2007-02-21 23:08:00,13728,"~CK~, the pic your looking for was posted by Andy on his board (Musky Striker)quite a while back. Get in touch with him...he'll send you the pic for sure."
38309,~CK~,2007-02-22 17:26:00,30,"Thanks guys, I think irishfield has it...  it looked like it could have been a laundry room, lol.  Roy, I have never been on the Musky Striker board, it was definitely the old OFC board that I saw it. Thanks anyway."
38316,ccmtcanada,2007-02-22 17:37:00,7971,Do you mean this pic?    That was pigeontroller's thread...the link is: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=2044&hl=
38325,~CK~,2007-02-22 18:00:00,30,YAY!! HAPPY DANCE!! WOOT!!  I had already sent him a pm asking to send it to me but you beat him to it! Thank You!!
38329,Raf,2007-02-22 18:06:00,3495,I donno if there's enough room there.   Danged muskie gear and it's size.  It's a pretty good idea.
38367,snag,2007-02-22 19:36:00,1932, I VOTE CCMT M.V.P OF THE BOARD!  MOST VALUABLE POSTER!  Where did you grab that? How do you do stuff like that? Dang!
38373,ccmtcanada,2007-02-22 19:48:00,7971," Snag...it's quite easy...someone said it was pigeontroller's thread, so I went to his profile and looked at his thread topics.  It wasn't hard to find the right one....maybe I shouldn't tell how easy it is and let some ppl think I'm really good at this internet thing....LOL."
38396,~CK~,2007-02-22 20:34:00,30,"LOL! And I was here trying to do a search for all threads with ""lures"", ""hanging lures"", etc... Imagine how much time I wasted.."
