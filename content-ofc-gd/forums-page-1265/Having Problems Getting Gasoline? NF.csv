37622,ccmtcanada,2007-02-21 19:50:00,7971,"So...with the problems at the refinery that supplies Esso and a few other independents, has anyone had problems buying gasoline today? I heard on the radio last night that there is no need to panic...but for the next 10 days, there may be rotating supply to Esso stations.  Well, this morning, I head to work....hit Bayview Avenue from the 401 down to Eglinton. The Esso had no gas, so I headed to the Shell station at Eglinton. They also had no gas because of Esso customers heading to that station.  The industry is saying that if panic buying were to take hold, we could be in trouble all around finding gas.  I hope it's not too bad this afternoon...I may or may not have enough to get home tonite!!!"
37625,Joey,2007-02-21 19:53:00,9122,"Yep, I went to get gas at the Esso down the road on the way to work and they have none.  He said maybe they'll get some in a day or two.  Joey"
37627,Headhunter,2007-02-21 19:55:00,5703,"All I need is enough to get me to the GTG and back! I had a full tank yesterday, but my wife's driving the ""siphon"" around today... who knows how much will be left! HH"
37638,walleyejigger,2007-02-21 20:15:00,876,"gas yesterday morning here was 85.9, today it's 96.9 and just drove by our local CT gas bar (which has been open for less than a month) and the sign says sorry, no gas"
37692,ccmtcanada,2007-02-21 21:01:00,7971,"Just heard from a friend of mine....3 stations he went to had no gas....the 4th one had some, but didn't know how long it would last!"
37696,Eddyk,2007-02-21 21:03:00,195,The gas station I normaly deal with had no regular gas today so they were selling premium for 94 cents a liter so I guess I cant complain.
37720,tonyb,2007-02-21 21:25:00,1637,Great...more gasoline supply shortage propganda to get in line for another gas price hike for the summer  Tony
37792,knightfisher,2007-02-21 23:00:00,237," That's all it is, propaganda. The powers that be, know gasoline and all home utilities are necessities of life and people will pay whatever is dictated. And you all thought you lived in a democracy. If there was a real fear of gasoline shortage, wouldn't the governments or who ever, force car manufactures to get rid of humvee's and produce more four cylinder cars. It's all about corporate greed and nothing more."
37812,motv8tr,2007-02-21 23:28:00,2587,"I fortunately drive a diesel, so I'm ok for now...except one local guy here decided he'd raise the price of diesel by 10 cents     Fortunately the guy down the road was more reasonable...well as reasonable as they can be.  Maureen"
37846,holdfast,2007-02-22 00:17:00,1813,"You Know, I went to Toronto past weeknd to my fathers funeral and gas went up 7-10 cents.  If you ask me, ITS GAS GOUGING TIME AGAIN.  In the mean time its still 93.9 in North Battleford SK.  Hasnt changed since SEP.  I really like to squeeze somebodys neck.  And that fella that decided to up the price of Diesal.  Maybe if it was broadcasted to everyone who is price hiking, just maybe prices might steady.  Yea get ready for Summer."
37905,camillj,2007-02-22 01:18:00,1988,Interesting ... I read an 'investor' article this week that predicted Oil down to $30 barrel by the summer ... oversupply .... sheesh ... who do you believe
37916,Loonietoon,2007-02-22 01:26:00,1450,Just got gas in Hamilton at the Pioneer Upper James & Mohawk Paid 92.3  CTC at the same corner all roped off... Out off Gas... Every one still has gas including Esso at Upper James & Hester 1block away... Do I detect a scam... Wait till others run out as they put it then open up again at a Higher Price.... HMMMMMMM
37958,Garyv,2007-02-22 02:12:00,547,"They have more freekin excuses ( possibly lies ? ) to justify any price they want.  Yes we in Sarnia had an explosion at the refinery a few weeks ago and there was the fire, but if those two operations can create this much chaos wait until the Canadian hurricane season.  Canada is self sufficient in oil energy, we just choose to sell it to the rest of the markets, especially the US.  Most oil producing nations charge their population a much lower rate than their customers but noooooo not us.  It's obviously time for the Federal Government to take a serious in depth look at the collusion that goes on between oil companies.  Funny thing is we are an oil ( energy ) based economy but no one seems to mention the obvious detriment to purchasing and manufacturing when prices rise.  Oh and while I'm at it let me mention the Hybrid......if we have pollution form emissions what is going to happen in the next 5 to 10 years when all these lead batteries used in these ""efficient"" vehicles have to be replaced.  Hope they recycle!"
38026,Blake,2007-02-22 03:20:00,418,Same down here in St.Kitts.  How is is out east Ottawa way if anyone knows?????
38035,irishfield,2007-02-22 03:29:00,26272,"It's everywhere Blake. Elliot Lake has no fuel at their ONE station for the whole town of 12,000. CTC's gas bar..that is of course supplied by Esso and the locals panic'd and drained the tanks.  Just a well staged ""problem""...."
38057,Deano,2007-02-22 03:57:00,767,"It's not a supply problem as that were gonna run out of fuel, It's a problem that the fuel cannot be refined fast enough. I just stopped working in Dec for a company that transported fuel to the esso stattions. It been a problem since last summer. And for those who haven't heard both imperial plants have had explosions (Sarnia and Nanticote). Which is causing a slow down of refining fuel. And diesel is gonna be hard to get also, nairn truck centre just west of sudbury, is out of diesel. My opinion is it's gonna get worse before it gets better."
