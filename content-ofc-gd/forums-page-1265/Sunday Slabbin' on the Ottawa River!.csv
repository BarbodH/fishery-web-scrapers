37726,tip-up,2007-02-21 21:37:00,94,"Fished one of the Ottawa Rivers many back waters today in search of crappie, bluegill and pike. I reached the spot at about 1:00 and was greeted by a well known buddy Nighttroller. He was aready into the slab crappie well before I got there.  After punching a quick few holes with the Jiffy(You saved my arms once again Rich), I got set up and started to mark fish right away...Fish were in about 10 - 13 Feet of water and were suspended just a few feet off of the bottom..Nighttroller was still nailing them while I was fishing over a hole filled with tiny perch..All of a sudden, I notice a red line on the vex dart up towards my small teardrop and felt a hit. After a quick battle and transducer-line tangle, I managed to plunk my first ever largemouth bass on the ice. Some battle on 2lbs fluro..  As the day went on I moved a few feet deeper and found active fish. Action was pretty steady up until I had to leave. crappie were hitting small teardrops with 2 waxies tipped on it..Bluegill hit pretty much anything..Released most, kept a few for my grandfather. Here are a few pictures from the day!    "
