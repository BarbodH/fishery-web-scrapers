38422,Joey,2007-02-22 21:32:00,9122,"Hello Cambridge  My name is Mr. Alfred Nelson, a Banker with one of the leading banks here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire West Africa; I am the personal account manager to Mr. Morrison Cambridge, who used to be a contractor with an oil servicing company based here in Cote d’Ivoire. My client, his wife, and their three children were involved in the ill fated Kenya Airways crash in the coasts of Abidjan in January 2000 in which all passengers on board died. Since then I have made several inquiries to locate any of my clients extended relatives but have been unsuccessful. I decided to trace his last name over the internet, to see if I could locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.  Of particular interest is this large deposit with our bank here, where the deceased has an account valued at about ($15 million US dollars). They have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or the bank will declare the account unserviceable and thereby send the funds to the government treasury.  Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over last 5 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name, so that the proceeds of this account valued can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.  All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under all legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law.  If you can handle this with me, reach me now through this email account with the following informations:  1. Your Name 2. Postal Address 3. Date of Birth 4. Telephone and fax numbers 5. Profession with position  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.  Sincerely yours  Alfred Nelson   Sooooooo, should I respond  Joey"
38425,urbanangler1990,2007-02-22 21:37:00,933,"wow, u would post this private stuff in a public place?"
38428,douG,2007-02-22 21:39:00,2693,"I'd  reply without the DoB info and see what happens.  To say that it sounds fishy is an  understatement, but you are one savvy internet grl.  Just make sure that you never give info that would let someone impersonate you,  or have access to your bank accounts / credit card.  I think if you pull this off, you can take me and The RLG out to dinner.  BTW, did you try Googling Mr. 'Cambridge Cote d'Ivoire Abidjan crash' ?  You can ask for supporting info, then double  check em.  If this is a scam (99.9 %  sure),  you can still have some fun for free."
38431,dsn,2007-02-22 21:47:00,1018,Don't!!  I had one simular to that. I just deleted it. Mine was also about some tragedy also. And that someone need my financial help immediately.  I felt bad about not helping. But Its a cold world out there. If I see someone who's in financial need that fine. But to reply to emails to stangers? And strangers asking for private info? forget it!! Some folks will stoop very low to get what they need from kind people so beware!!   dsn
38432,Bernie,2007-02-22 21:47:00,3190,Seen that one before. Not on my mail but others. Cant believe its still around either. How do they get away with this stuff?
38434,Joey,2007-02-22 21:50:00,9122,"Ya, I thought about playing with him for awhile, just to amuse myself, but don't think I'll bother.  I've got fishing to do  Just can't believe it myself either.  Freakin scammers.  Joey"
38435,douG,2007-02-22 21:52:00,2693,"Here is a good selection of info on these and similar 'advance fee' doo dads.  Loosers.  Apparently Nigerians hate these email requests too.  You gotta read this one, some serious stuff  with the scammees definitely putting the boots to the scammers.  Some of the stuff is hilarious, with 'multiple' participants."

38447,douG,2007-02-22 22:09:00,2693,"From Ms. Sandra Franken, Account Department Commercial Bank- Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire ( Ivory Coast ). Dear Compliments of the season and how are you today I hope you are fine. Before i proceed i would like to introduce myself to you. as a banker i would like to share this great deal to lovedone before anything. My name is Ms. Sandra Franken, a staff in accounts/ operation department of A COMMERCIAL BANK- ABIDJAN COTE D'IVOIRE( FOMER IVORY COAST ). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 2000, An oil consultant / contractor with the ABIDJAN COTE D'IVOIRE National Petrolum Corporation, Mr.ALOYSIUS HAN, made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for twelve calendar valued at US$ 10,000,000.00 ( Ten Million united states dollars ) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contact employers COTE D'IVOIRE National Petroleum corporation that Mr.ALOYSIUS HAN, died in a plane crash with his entire family. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.ALOYSIUS HAN, did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the ABIDJAN COTE D'IVOIRE Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the COTE D'IVOIRE Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. ALOYSIUS HAN, so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. 1. I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin to this fixed deposit. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk as all the paper work for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as a staff of this department, guarantees the successful execution of this deal. If you are interested, please reply immediately and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the deal very well. Please observe utmost confidentcial, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent response via my private email [email protected] for security purpose feel free to ask me for more detail. Yours Ms. Sandra Franken NB.Pls, keep this transaction secret from your friends and my bank till the transfer is made.  An A310  crashed off Abidjan in January 2000.  I'm having trouble trying to find out if your long lost cousin Cambridge was aboard."
38448,charlesn,2007-02-22 22:09:00,551,"Here's the thing though.  For this and other well known scams to be still going around, someone somewhere must be falling for it?  That's the truly sad thing as it preys on the weakest and most trusting people.  Kinda like the scum that bilk pensioners out of their money during periods of tragedy like 9/11 or the tsunami.  Special place in hell for sp©ammers.  Charles"
38454,Rich Clemens,2007-02-22 22:15:00,3131,"How can anyone pass up a free $15 million ?   Might be fun to string them along a little, but do be careful."
38459,Joey,2007-02-22 22:20:00,9122,"Geez DouG, I would have at least thought the scammer would only get the 30% and the scammed person would get the 70%.  So little do I know.  It's definately not worth it now.  Joey"
38477,camillj,2007-02-22 22:57:00,1988,Dont respond ... according to the RCMP (whom I contacted on one I got a few years back) these folks are likely trying to get information they will then use for identity theft ... a very scary thing since they use it to find out more about you and then borrow money ... against your house for example ...so dont play around with this ... delete it and forget it
38482,mason05,2007-02-22 23:08:00,258,"""Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over last 5 years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name, so that the proceeds of this account valued can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money.""  I think Alfred needs to brush up on his English before hitting send.....That's the longest sentence ever!  Wow just read DougG's reply.  I take it back, Alfred is a linguistics master.  It is Ms. Sandra Franken who holds the trophy for the ultimate bastar dization of the English Language.  P.S. Delete that crap now!  Corn Nug"

38506,fishergirl72,2007-02-22 23:39:00,455,"Hey Joey, I get those all the time and I just delete them, to me they are just a scam, nothing more, nothing less."
