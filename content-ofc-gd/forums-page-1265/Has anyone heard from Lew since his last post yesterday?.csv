38358,Big Cliff,2007-02-22 19:23:00,6899,"Well, you know what, Lew is one of the biggest contributors on this board and he is a friend. I don't have his phone number but if someone has it please PM it to me! If he just wants to take a break then so be it but I just need him to tell me that!  He sounded sad in his last post!  that is not the way it should be!  Lew, if im invading your space,  I apologize!  Big Cliff"
38383,Joey,2007-02-22 20:06:00,9122,"BigCliff, I also noticed that. I checked late last night and then again today to see if Lew had posted again since his last thread and was upset to find out that he had not.  I too don't have his number.  Hope everything is okay Lew.  Joey"

Were heading to Ottawa in the morning for a mini-vacation for awhile and I've just been getting everything ready for the trip."

38531,Roy,2007-02-23 00:29:00,13728,"Some people can be absent from the board for a few hours and people notice. Others can drop away for months and noone notices. This means that you are respected, Lew. Have a great trip and if you only have one smile, please try to do it on Parliament Hill."
38534,fishergirl72,2007-02-23 00:35:00,455,"Try and enjoy your trip Lew, it is well deserved and needed after what you and your family have been through."
