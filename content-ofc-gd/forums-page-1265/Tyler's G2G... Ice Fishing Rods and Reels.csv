I will have 5 combos with me and a manual auger.  I will loan these to anyone who is without.  Do not stay away because of equipment shortages,  come and enjoy the day and meet our great members.  The weatherman is going to co-operate. Temps -7c with clear and sunny conditions. Great day for walking on water   John"
