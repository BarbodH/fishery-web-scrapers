37670,fishbait,2007-02-21 20:42:00,23,I set a check up to Kevin and have to ask for a confirmation and still haven't received a invoice for the remaining balance.  Is this the SOP at this place?  Every other place   I've been to sends me confirmation and an invoice and all sorts of info.  The place looks great but I just want to make sure of things.

37798,kgeary,2007-02-21 23:05:00,82,"Hi guys Yeah that's pretty much SOP I usually confirm by email when I receive deposits. In most cases people email me before I even receive them. It's hard to believe it takes 10-14 days to receive a letter up here. In about March I'll send out confirmations. All the details are on the website. I always say ""any questions please ask"" Rest assured all is well. I've been busy hauling materials and gas to camp. need about 7000 gallons for the season. building 2 new cabins. looks like another great season coming up. regards kg"
