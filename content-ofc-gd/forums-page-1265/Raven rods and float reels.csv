Has anyone out there seen the new custom IM8 float rods with the wood reel seat and butt plate, and the SST3 has to be one of the smoothest and lightest reels.  I use right now a Raven IM8 14ft 3pc float rod and run a Islander reel, but I think that after yesyerday I am going to purchase a SST3 and still use the IM8 but now I think its going to be the 15ft..  check out the website   http://www.raventackle.com/ http://www.anglersinternational.com/  Does anyone else use there products,  I am very happy with mine and its landed some of the nicest fish.   Very cool products  Dave"

I bought my IM9 the first week it came out back in 2001 (I think) and other than guides breaking off, I'm happy with how it has survived some of my stupid wrong doings - Ex: whacking on the Humber bridge hundreds of times; Trees; basement ceiling; yanking on snags; high sticking; chain link fences; subway doors; bus doors; street car doors.  I'm currently in the middle of rebuilding it and swapping the guides for Fuji high-framed SICs'.  I also use the line and beyond the odd phantom break above the leader, I like how it has performed in 8lb - 6lb is too stretchy for me as a mainline.  Their fluorocarbon leaders have also performed well over the years."

38405,kemper,2007-02-22 20:55:00,2232,Ive been looking for a longer float rod to use on some bigger water when my 11.5 Fenwick just doesnt cut it. Raven is definatly one of the companies Im liking right now.
