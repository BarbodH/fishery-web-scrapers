29542,Puckhead,2007-02-01 19:17:00,377,Just came to my attention that the pool was removed from Yahoo very quickly after the season ended.  I think my post of the address to send the winnings to   may not have been recieved by all.  I've only recieved the 'bounty' from 4 guys.  Sooo...  my assumption is that you all that participated must not have the address??  Send me a PM for the address and I promise to have a report as to all the good stuff recieved right here for all of you to drool over.  Thanks so much to the guys that paid up already - the stuff recieved has been great!

29646,Crazyhook,2007-02-01 21:26:00,1154,"hey! PM me your address! would you prefer a gift certificate or baits ( if baits, what do you fish for)  yahoo pulled it rather quickly, congrats on Killing everyone!"
29652,Smokey,2007-02-01 21:34:00,1278,Hope you received mine by now and congrats again.  Mike
29695,irongimp,2007-02-01 22:55:00,2,Damn!! I am sorry!! It completly slipped my mind!! Please send me your adress and i will send out your prize this weekend!!!
29969,Puckhead,2007-02-02 14:30:00,377,"  Yahoo did pull it fast - was surprised...  Would love to take credit for the beat down, but it think it more had something to do with Tomlinson! (and having him cheap)  Gift certificates are more than fine!  Gbay - got it man, thanks!  I really look forward to pulling those beauties around!  Smokey, got it too!  It's already spent    Thanks guys!  PM's sent to those that needed it.  Cheers and enjoy the big show this weekend guys!!"
29973,Smokey,2007-02-02 14:39:00,1278,Now lets see some results with the gear.
30027,Bitsmith2k,2007-02-02 16:21:00,396,"pm me your address.. i'll send you a gift card..  i think i finished dead last by a bunch, thats gotta be worth something   Jake Delhomme really screwed me over.."
30050,Puckhead,2007-02-02 17:12:00,377,"PM sent - delhomme should retire, he was terrible last year."
37666,Puckhead,2007-02-21 20:39:00,377,"Another few weeks have passed and still nada.... BOOOOOO!!!!!!  Come on folks!  I need to use some of these baits for the OFC tourney  Seriously though, you can pick up bass pro gift certificates at shell gas stations now, sooooo, let's go guys!  I'm going to start a post of shame pretty soon"
37699,GbayGiant,2007-02-21 21:05:00,1780,Did you try to pm the guys you're waiting for. I think they jumped ship.
37811,Puckhead,2007-02-21 23:26:00,377,"It's wierd - I've had the PM convo's and all that fun stuff - and well known OFNers were talking about so I'm a bit surprised to be honest.  Not ready to give up just yet - lets see what happens over the next week or two.  People are busy, crap happens, not much one can do about it I suppose...."
