37200,cisco,2007-02-21 00:44:00,597,"Gerritt. Yer a great guy. Now quit apologizin alla time. Sheesh!!! Try to cut down.... maybe try for one a week.... then one every two months and so on. Soon you'll get used to the idea of having folks taking swipes, and you'll shrug it off or post accordingly.  Alla best bud!"
37258,Frankypro,2007-02-21 01:48:00,63,"I'm real new to the site BUT I genuinely look forward to seeing what's going every day.  That's why I joined.  Sites well run    and like my star choice television I can pick and choose the channels that interest me, so not all threads are my fav's but I appreciate the courtesy and respect that mods have developed here.   Got something you wanna ask?  Just Ask?"
37465,Gerritt,2007-02-21 14:44:00,6129,"   Awwwww gee shucks....*blushes*   I try not to apologize, all the time...ok I retract my apology... now where are my percs? LOL   Gerritt.  yer not a bad guy yourself brother."
38135,Pope29,2007-02-22 11:42:00,29,  Wouldn't it allow you to make two seperate forums then?? One for fish reports and one for the other   ??
38201,bigfish1965,2007-02-22 14:35:00,3382,"Certainly would Pope, however the members have repeatedly and overwhelmingly preferred to keep the current format. Once the spring hits there will be much less   and way more"
36814,muskieb,2007-02-20 13:39:00,58,"If it hadn't been for the demise of the Simcoe board earlier this year I likely wouldn't have discovered how good this board has become.  From what I remembered this was a board that was overrun by a bunch of pointless badgering, which is something I have not seen since my short return.  It appears that this is the busiest board out there now for Ontario fishermen, and yet from what I have seen it is also the cleanest board.  A true testament to some solid management.  The members here make this a very interesting board as they are so open and willing to share information with anyone who asks.  It is a great site, with tons of information, and tons of great people just looking to help eachother and maybe have a little fun in the meantime.  Great work!"
36816,Terry,2007-02-20 13:46:00,14456,well you should have been here the first 2 weeks of Jan... when no one is fishing the non fishing  threads do pile up
36818,OhioFisherman,2007-02-20 13:49:00,6623,"Cabin Fever hits here too, grumpies!"
36821,Spiel,2007-02-20 13:55:00,9065,"....Thanks Muskieb, but as has been mentioned ""cabin fever"" does happen. The entire Admin team all work hard at keeping things flowing. Hope you stick around and enjoy the board."
36822,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 13:56:00,6899,"OFC is a Family and just like any family we have our moments but when you want to see the true colors of the members of this board, just need a hand or a sholder, you will be overwhelemed with the response!"
36828,muskieb,2007-02-20 14:03:00,58,"Big Cliff you said it really well.  There was a post a couple weeks back where a member asked advice on quitting a job to persue a new career.  The responses to that post were amazing, tons of advice to help him through his decision and to help others possibly in the same situation.  That really showed the caliber of guys on here and their willingness to support others."
36834,TJQ,2007-02-20 14:15:00,7806,Thanks!!..
36840,largemouth,2007-02-20 14:19:00,112,"yes if you need non-fishing info, this is the best fishing site by far."
36844,Gerritt,2007-02-20 14:21:00,6129,Hey MuskieB your correct these guys do put up with alot and filter out the bad stuff to ensure a decent user experience   Largemouth there are other boards out there if you dont like this one. Feel free to goggle em.   Gerritt.
36848,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 14:27:00,6899,"largemouth, I guess you just haven't been around here long enough. Our common bond is fishing but we are about so much more than just fishing. We've all seen what happens to the boards that are JUST ABOUT FISHING. I hope you'll hang around here long enough to become a contributing member of the family!"
36869,largemouth,2007-02-20 15:24:00,112," Big Cliff i have been around this site for years and i know the drill. I stopped posting my reports due to the constant smart coments from guys who donâ€™t fish often but consider themselves experts because of their high post counts.   (Gerritts post is a classic example).  OFC is a family and they discuss family matters (IE leaky basements, family deaths, arts and crafts etc.) I respect that   and I browse it from time to time and have learnt stuff from it, but my reports and fishing related topics are found on other sites that are dedicated to fishing. This is the BEST fishing site for non-fishing topics, take the compliment as it was meant."
36875,TJQ,2007-02-20 15:35:00,7806,"I understand what largemouth is saying, and I dont think hes being vindictive about it.. there is alot of non-fishing posts here and thats ok.. thats why we changed the name to OFCcommunity....  In any event, we also have alot of better moderation features with this new software so we dont wind up with as many difficulties as the past..   I hope that largemouth would give us another chance and help us with more fishing reports to help with that!"
36878,Gerritt,2007-02-20 15:38:00,6129,"While, I think I was justified in my post, if it was taking in an ill manner, please forgive me... perhaps LargeMouth will start posting some fishing reports for us to see?... and remember we love pictures!  Gerritt."
36885,ehg,2007-02-20 15:56:00,2666,"In the late spring/ summer when all fish have an open season the fishing reports/ topics verge on overkill. But thats a good thing. This year the ice season was about a month behind leaving not much reports.  Usually when people leave or stop posting they have personal non-fishing issues.   Personally i miss the badgering and bickering of the first board when deleting posts was more difficult.   cheers, ehg"
36919,Big Cliff,2007-02-20 17:03:00,6899,"Largemouth, don't give up on the family just because we hit a little bump in the road from time to time. I too have modified my posting from time to time because of trends but I stand ready to help anyone anytime even if it means I have to PM them so as not to broadcast information that may affect someone elses fishing.  If you have chosen to return under a different name for whatever reason then welcome back and I do hope you will contribute with fishing related posts or in whatever manner you choose."
36923,tinbanger,2007-02-20 17:10:00,1028,"Excellent site and as far as the management of it goes.   They are good ,fair ....... and above all fast   Tinbanger"
36932,bigfish1965,2007-02-20 17:35:00,3382,"Well we'd like to take credit but we can't really. There are two forces that make the site what it is. The membership is, of course, the driving force. Collectively we have set the culture and tone of the site and have created the community aspect. The software allows us to do things no other fishing board can. It just makes life much easier for us."
36965,Josh Rogers,2007-02-20 19:07:00,79, I agree with largemouth in a sense too. ...and remember we love pictures! That's all most guys on this site are looking for. It sorta ticks me off when I post a report and about 5 guys say where's the pictures? where's the pictures? Anyways that's all I have to say on that subject. This is definately a good site to get some fishing info though. I've got lots of tips from the lads and ladies on here. Keep up the good work everyone.  ATF
36969,zman,2007-02-20 19:15:00,179,This is one awesome run site allot of great members
36978,misfish,2007-02-20 19:23:00,29133,Yep good peoples here. Now if we could just get Gerritt some perks     LOL
37076,Rich Clemens,2007-02-20 22:20:00,3131,"Ya have to sonder what the mods do in there spare time.  That is, the time they have away from keeping all the kids playing nice.  Yeah - the mods to a great job.  I've pretty much knocked the other fishing boards from my favorites and just live here."
37081,Gerritt,2007-02-20 22:27:00,6129,"   I say things, as I see it at the time.... sometimes people see it as positive... sometimes not.... I have come to learn I cannot please everyone 100% of the time, regardless of what I post... those who cant deal with it, they gripe because I am to the point and dont hold back any punches... those that do agree send me PM's.... it is weird....LOL... but yes... if you are willing be become part of a ""Family"" this is the place for you... if you are looking just for fishing info and dont wish to contibute in any positive manner .... well perhaps .........     I'll leave that answer for another time.  Gerritt."
37083,Pete Maina,2007-02-20 22:32:00,213,Agreed! Here here ...  Pete
37124,fishindevil,2007-02-20 23:29:00,6254,"you got that one right on the money,our mods,and admin ARE THE BEST AS IS ALL THE MEMBERS,   this is the best fishing board period......."
37145,Bernie,2007-02-20 23:47:00,3190,This is the first forum that I really ever signed on to that I cant wait to see what comes up next.   Very interesting place.
