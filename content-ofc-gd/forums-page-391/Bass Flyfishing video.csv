710072,Parisite,2012-06-28 17:21:00,66,I was doing that Sunday evening. Fish and scenery weren't nearly as impressive as what was shown in the video but I had a blast.  It was my first time fly fishing for bass. First time targeting anything other than trout with the fly rod actually. Went about 12/15 in an hour.  Time to get some poppers!
710074,johnnyb,2012-06-28 17:33:00,3413,Watched it with the sound off here at work and loved it....motivation to bust out the whippy rod
710098,Jds63,2012-06-28 19:07:00,1365," I havn't used my flyrod in several years and am getting back into it this summer. We are renting a cottage up in Haliburton in a few weeks and was planning on practising my rusty casts from the dock early morning and late evening. What were you using for the bass ? most of my stuff is for smaller trout... I have a few streamers but no poppers, I have seen foam style poppers on the market."
710109,cuzza,2012-06-28 19:38:00,467," Clouser minnows in chartreuse and white or black and white will get you into some bass, poppers are a lot of fun when thy're in the mood for them."
710110,misfish,2012-06-28 19:40:00,29133,"At 2:16 when he,s casting,is he pulling the line back,then releasing it? Man he gets some distance.  Great vid."
710114,Barrie fly fisher,2012-06-28 20:00:00,2,What he is doing is double hauling it helps load the line faster and helps put out more line. And great vid thanks for posting
710116,misfish,2012-06-28 20:02:00,29133,Thanks for the reply.
710117,misfish,2012-06-28 20:05:00,29133," They will be my choice this weekend. Might even try some large dry flies.   Still waiting for my buddy,to get his tying kit out,so I can start my streamer making."
710153,Locnar,2012-06-28 23:23:00,645,"Excellent video, it is quite relevant to my interests."
710183,dave524,2012-06-29 01:13:00,4508," My favourite large dry fly for smallies is actually a streamer, take a muddler minnow and fish it dry on the surface, they will float well cause of the deer hair and is a reasonable imitator of probably a hopper, large caddis or a miller type moth that has fallen on the surface. Bass aren't fussy   if it looks like food"
710317,frozen-fire,2012-06-29 15:13:00,542,Fantastic footage...Gets me going for sure.
710318,BillM,2012-06-29 15:15:00,17367," If you are going to fish topwater this weekend, do it bright and early or as the sun goes down in the evening..  I'll be out on Gloucestor/Little on Monday messing around."
710320,misfish,2012-06-29 15:17:00,29133," The lake I,ll be fishing Bill,they hit all day."
710392,davey buoy,2012-06-29 19:44:00,5505, Shuks!!I want to go too!!.Have a good one B.
