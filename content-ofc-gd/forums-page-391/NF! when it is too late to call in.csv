710239,hookerdown,2012-06-29 11:31:00,110,"Getting the goofs on cam wont do anything.  When I lived in a condo in Mississauga I had my truck stolen twice (in 6 months)from my underground parking spot which was right by the enterance to the elevators.  They caught the guys in clear view of several cameras.  The cops told me that its unlikely that they will catch the guys, in the grand scheme of things car theft is low on their priority list.  My insurance company even told me that they can potentially consider that I live in a high crime area (Clarkson/Oakville boarder).  From what you are saying, it seems that the guys knew to go under the hood to disable the car alarm first (not their time breaking into cars)...  I hate to say it but there is little that you could have done to prevent it.  What you could do though is to really get to know your neighbours... If the guys know that there are potential eyes they would avoid your street.  Many years ago the same thing happened on my parent's street.  Some kids (5-8 guys in their late teens/early 20's)decided to break into cars on people driveways (I think they broke into 20-25 cars) well one of them ended breaking a car window to get some change that was left in a car, well they ended up waking up the homeowner, who ended making a ton of noise chasing the dudes.  Long story short, someone ended up IDing one of the guys, and they got nabbed, not sure about his partners.   Since then no cars have been broken into."

710328,206,2012-06-29 15:45:00,563," Ha! not a Good idea, I had nothing of value and assume thats why it was burt...now I leave the doors open and 5bucks in the cup holder, they can take the money and go on there way."

710637,smally21,2012-07-01 13:11:00,993,ive been the victim of auto theft over a dozen times - both whole vehicle or break in. police in our area do not respond to car theft of any kind. you need to make a police report for your insurance company you go to the police station and get in line for one.  had an officer tell me once that auto theft in hamilton (6000 vehicles a year BTW) was a 'victimless crime' as the insurance company covers your losses anyway...took my breath away!!  so the idea that local enforcement is gonna send out the CSI team to satisfy you over some dusty handprints is laughable.
710642,lew,2012-07-01 13:24:00,12766," WOW !!!! ...I'd definetly be looking for a different place to live.  In all my years of owning a car, I can honestly say I have NEVER had a break-in.  Just real lucky I spose"
710651,Grimace,2012-07-01 14:27:00,2020,Hamilton is the car theft capital of Ontario.  I have a buddy that lives in Brampton and his vehicle was constantly getting broken into.  Now he just leaves the doors unlocked and nothing of value in it.  About 2 or 3 times a month he notices that his glove box has been rummaged through or the interior light is on. He just shrugs his shoulders and goes to work.  I could never live like that.  It is a sad state of affairs.
710678,smally21,2012-07-01 16:49:00,993,"Rampant here lew - sometimes the whole car, a window here, a rummaging there, stereo a couple times, sometimes just a look thru..  The worst ones are when they do a significant amount of damge but DON'T TAKE THE DAMN THING!!!  I can honestly say I don't know anyone that hasn't had their car stolen or broken into in this area.  Its usually the nicer neighborhoods and shopping areas that are targeted..remember there is ""hamilton"" and then the surrounding towns that amalgamated..this is where most of the cars get yanked."
709540,GBW,2012-06-26 22:05:00,8460,"I'm looking for anyone who can help on this one.  I go to take off from work today to go home and my car looks like it's been man handeled by someone covered in dust.  I check a few other cars around and they all have the same hand prints on them.  My car they tried to get in from the driverside door and even pop the hood.  I had to get going home for my son's soccer do I didn't call the police.  Is there anything I can do?  There are very visable finger prints on my hood and doors.  At first I thought it could have been a joke but no way would a joke like 'that' have been done to 15 or more car's.  ideads, help?  thanks!  G"
709543,BillM,2012-06-26 22:08:00,17367,"If they didn't actually get in, no crime has been committed.  Cops won't do a thing."
709544,GBW,2012-06-26 22:11:00,8460,even when I counted 15 car's all marked up?  I never went to check on the other car's to see if the doors were open and if things were missing as I don't know the owner of each car...
709547,BillM,2012-06-26 22:15:00,17367,"Could have been a bunch of stupid kids looking in the window.  You can call, I just wouldn't expect much if nothing's actually been taken/broken/damaged."

709551,GBW,2012-06-26 22:18:00,8460,"I'm not expecting much at all but just wondering.  after all, there have been break in's in cars in the last month and or damage.  it's a hard to see spot and it's loaded with cars."
709553,GBW,2012-06-26 22:19:00,8460,I'm going to start parking by you then.  the walks about the same I guess...
709554,BillM,2012-06-26 22:19:00,17367,Set up a game camera and catch the buggers in the act.
709555,GBW,2012-06-26 22:21:00,8460,If I had one you can bet your   I would be using it!
709557,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-26 22:34:00,2582,I'd call it in anyway. If there is a problem and enough others in the area do the same perhaps a patrol car might just do a check of the area and catch them in the act.  They can't act on something if they know nothing about it.
709559,ccmtcanada,2012-06-26 22:49:00,7971,"Not sure a ""crime"" was committed here Geoff...I suppose it can be reported, but I wouldn't expect much to come of it.  Are there surveillance cameras in the lot where you work?"

I'll trade you even up... your car for my truck... no one breaks into my truck... sure they may open it up, but after looking inside, they tend to leave stuff for me!
