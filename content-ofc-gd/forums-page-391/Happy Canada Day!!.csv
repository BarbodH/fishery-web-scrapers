We are proud to be Canadian. And have contributed to her growth from day one. Today even better, we celebrate our granddaughter 1st birthday and Wed I fly out to see family in the old country for three weeks. I haven't been back in 40 years.  Have safe weekend. I'm bringing my pad and hopefully I can check in while having glass of wine!"
