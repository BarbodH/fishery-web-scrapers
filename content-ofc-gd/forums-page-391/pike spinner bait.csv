710618,redpearl99,2012-07-01 06:19:00,259,what do you guys think is more important when pike fishing with spinner baits.... adding a twister or adding a trailer hook ?
710620,davey buoy,2012-07-01 09:35:00,5505,I catch a lot just the way they are. I like the 3/8oz. White the best.
710621,Rich Clemens,2012-07-01 10:02:00,3131,Same here.  Just add a twister tail.  Pike will hit just about anything.
710622,singingdog,2012-07-01 10:24:00,1047,Why not do both? Thread a grub onto a trailer hook and add it to the spinnerbait. It's a great way to increase the size of a regular spinnerbait.
710632,BillM,2012-07-01 12:38:00,17367,"Twistertail...   I never run a trailer on any of my spinnerbaits, no problem with hooksup with pike."
710634,lew,2012-07-01 12:44:00,12766, You could put an old boot on a hook and a pike would grab it.  Nothing fancy required to catch those critters.
710639,Whitespinnerbait,2012-07-01 13:15:00,2038,Neither  !!
710645,redpearl99,2012-07-01 13:36:00,259,"lol, I love how everyone has different advice..... put a twister on, put a twister and trailer on, put neither on"
710646,mercman,2012-07-01 13:38:00,7054,"Nothing. I bought a red/black Booyah,black willow, silver colorado, it is like a fish magnet"
710647,lew,2012-07-01 13:45:00,12766, Different situations require different techniques
710648,davey buoy,2012-07-01 13:48:00,5505," You asked the question,and you rec'd some great ideas so far . Experiment and see what works for you."
710658,redpearl99,2012-07-01 15:07:00,259,yea I think ill buy a couple new spinners and test out the best method
710659,mercman,2012-07-01 15:15:00,7054,"For bass along the shore, if i see a thin overhanging branch, i will cast it so the lure hangs off the branch and then ""dip"" it in the water. The ensuing explosion from the water will get your heart pumping"
710682,Gregoire,2012-07-01 16:56:00,1397," Is this something you actually do, or is it a result of you trying to cast under the branch and missing?"
710692,northernpike56,2012-07-01 18:05:00,717,"3/8 oz. plain white spinnerbait gets tons of pike from 20""-28"" for me. I have only put a white grub on the hook once but I'm sure some bigger fish would hit it."
710707,mercman,2012-07-01 18:55:00,7054," Honestly, at first it was by accident.Then after that accident produced a nice Pike, i do it on purpose when in a similar situation. You can do the same thing with any single hook lure, like bucktails etc.Even plastics rigged weedless are good.I wouldnt recomend useing a multi hooked lure though"
710712,davey buoy,2012-07-01 19:24:00,5505," Could you use a treeless lure a as opposed to a weedless lure?:lol:lol.Seriously,how do you keep your line from getting cut on the bark?."
710729,spincast,2012-07-01 21:05:00,3279,"So Paul, do you net the fish, or just wait till it shakes itself off and jumps back in the water?  "
710734,manitoubass2,2012-07-01 22:00:00,11391,"I've never used stinger hooks. I never used a trailer either until Mercmans thread on SB. I gave it a try and still caught fish. I wouldn't say more fish than without the trailer though, so I'd say either way you feel comfortable.  I like the simplicity of the SB though, and prefer to fish them as is, throughout the entire water column"
710735,redpearl99,2012-07-01 22:22:00,259,i was thinking of using a trailer hook because I use them on my spinner baits for bass.... where I've noticed about 40% of my bass are hooked on the trailer hook
710738,mercman,2012-07-01 22:31:00,7054,"Come on guys.....The bark wont bite Couldnt resist that. Its not as if i go around looking for branches all day to hang my lures off of...I'm just saying that if you see an overhanging branch...try it. Never lost a fish or lure this way.Caught a few though.Once the line is over the branch, just move it slowly so it doesnt wrap itself completely around it. The weight of the fish usually takes the line off the branch. If you dont get a fish, slowly reel in until the lure is at the branch, then give it a quick yank and it will flip back off of it."
710754,Rich,2012-07-02 00:37:00,3927,"Double tail grub on a heavy spinnerbait bulks it up, great in the fall trolling 1.5 to 3 oz baits"
710771,Handlebarz,2012-07-02 02:25:00,3790,I do each depending on the day and bite. Usually start twister no trailer but will add a trailer and put the twister on it. If neither work I would take both off. Most times just add twister
