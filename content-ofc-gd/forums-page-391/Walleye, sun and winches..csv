710549,Spiel,2012-06-30 15:33:00,9065,You'll have to give me about 20 hours notice Simon in order for me to make the dinner hour.
710550,limeyangler,2012-06-30 15:40:00,5204,  Dood....you'd always be welcome anytime....no notice needed just come on up . If we have no fish left....oh well...we would just have to go get some more
710551,Spiel,2012-06-30 15:55:00,9065," Thanks Simon. It's not the first time you've extended the open door invitation and I appreciate it.  I've have big plans to spend a vast amount of time up there as soon as the youngest gets off to University, two more years yet. But when he does you can be sure I'll find my way to your front door and if there's no fish on hand we'll definitely go get 'em! Hell we'll go get 'em regardless."
710554,Grimace,2012-06-30 16:40:00,2020,Great haul!  There are some nice fat ones in there as well.
710579,spincast,2012-06-30 21:28:00,3279,Sweet day on the water . A little effort and a golden reward. I really have to come up that way again.

710804,Blue Lk,2012-07-02 11:41:00,337,"Great report of an excellent day Simon. Would the name of that lake start with an R,if so,I haven't been there for years,but it sure looks familiar."
710805,davey buoy,2012-07-02 11:46:00,5505,Looks like a fine day Simon!!!!!Great pics.
710809,Roy,2012-07-02 12:13:00,13728,"Y'know Simon, lots of people (especially city dwellers) plan their holidays for a year or more to experience what you did on a whim. It's great that you can do that and many people live out their fishing dreams through your (and others') reports. Thank you for that. Another stellar report and super video."
710859,fishnsled,2012-07-02 14:13:00,3520,  X2 Another Limeyangler report that does not disappoint. Thanks for yet another awesome report Simon!!
