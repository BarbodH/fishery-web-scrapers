710213,Gregoire,2012-06-29 03:01:00,1397,On the way back to the launch at bluffers last night we came across two things that we found interesting. One guy was out in a bass boat apparently running and gunning. Another guy was anchored in about 30ft of water jigging. Were they after bass? Just wondering as I had not seen it before.
710214,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-29 03:09:00,1107,There's huge Bass in Lake O smallies and largies and I would think they are spread throughout the lake
710215,BillM,2012-06-29 03:09:00,17367,"I wouldn't doubt it, Lake O is littered with them, especially the southern shore around Rochester."
710218,Christopheraaron,2012-06-29 03:29:00,3525,"Lots of bass there, the islands create structure which the largies love and the channels create drop offs for the smallies."
710220,dave524,2012-06-29 03:38:00,4508,"Jordan Harbour had an excellent largemouth fishery, nobody fishes there any more now that the Campbell's Marina is gone and I understand it is silted in pretty bad. Lots of largies hanging around in the Fifty Point Marina too."
710411,Pigeontroller,2012-06-29 20:55:00,2793, Thats what happens when the local Bass club(s) run tournaments and release their fish out in the Beacon Harbour on Lake Ontario...
710412,misfish,2012-06-29 21:02:00,29133," Im pretty sure the results of the number of smallies here in the bay,are due to the old Mercury bass series."
710485,Acountdeleted,2012-06-30 02:02:00,2562,"Bluffers park marina has a rediculous number of 3-4 pound largies. Frenchmans bay is good as is Tommy Tompson park, and I won't tell you were exactly (don't want you catching all my fish) but the Toronto Islands are rediculous when it comes to bass. I saw a 6 pound largie come out of there once."
710755,Rich,2012-07-02 00:41:00,3927,Amazing smallie fishery. I'd rather fish smallies there than on Erie.
710795,Pigeontroller,2012-07-02 09:03:00,2793," Hmmmm, thats a statement!"
