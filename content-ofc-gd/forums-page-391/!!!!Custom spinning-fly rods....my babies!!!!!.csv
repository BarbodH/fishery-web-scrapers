711010,Riccardo,2012-07-02 23:21:00,12,"For me fishing is like an obsession...I am an exigent angler and  I want the best: lines, lures (I love japanese lures...4 exapl. the ""bent minnow"" by osp is one of my favorite!!!) and RODS When few years ago I bought ""normal"" rods I wasn't totally happy. Often the handles were too short, the rod too heavy and so expensive,  ect...but now It's an other story!!! I'm able to build my rods  chosing evrything: colour of thread, shape of handle, size of guides, reel seat...I dediced to post some pictures of my work...if you have questions or you need informations about this amazing hobby...let me know!!!!I am here!!! Have a good day Riccardo     "
