710694,Leecher,2012-07-01 18:13:00,7832,"Last week, Paul and I had talked about targeting a couple of local lakes... didn't have any specific plan other than going out and have a good time  So yesterday, left home at 6h00am... a couple of pit stops and the way we go... destination, North bound     No details in the temps department as it was sunny and light winds from the South East when we left.... PERFECT!!!  Arrived at lake one around 7h30am, launched Paul's boat and began our journey around the lake   Was hoping to get into some bows but they were no where to be found... instead we got into largies, not many but a few... they were in a scattered suspending pattern in about 5' to 8' fow  Around noon, we decided to pack up and leave...  Arrived at lake number 2 around 1h15pm, white caps and dark clouds could be seen on the horizon, a storm was coming through, winds had turn from the West and it didn't take long, the soaking began... Paul put the throttle to the max and head over the North end of the lake, beating the brunt of it  At this end of the lake we caught a lot of largies, nothing big but loads of fun  Moving around from spot to spot produced very well for us  All the while that first storm had pass, another was making it's appearance    dark clouds were hanging over in the distance, winds were from the South now diminishing    but that didn't last long, winds picked up from the West again and another cell was fast approaching  So we decided to hide behind an island facing East and wait it out... while we were waiting I had the urge to cast    So I did and hooked up with a largie  on the first cast     make my second and FISH ON!!!   A BRUTE!!!    17 1/2""er    I was using a Big O, lime color and man did it ever take a beaten      As you can see, lot's of battle scars Bass of all sizes couldn't get enough of it This was the only lure I used on this lake and did not disappoint All in all we caught over 50 bass between the two of us that were all released to be caught another day Got back home around 8h45pm  Bait of choice were: Whitespinnerbait, Scum frog, Sketter pop, Big O  Did not take many pics but here's some for your viewing pleasure                  Also made a video for those that enjoy!  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid732.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fww321%2Fleechman1%2FSoftwater%2520Season%25202012%2FTroutJunkiesAdventures-June302012.mp4"">  Special thanks goes out to Paul aka whitespinnerbait for a great time Hope you enjoy!
