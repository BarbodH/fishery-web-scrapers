710762,hotsky,2012-07-02 01:21:00,400,"I started fishing a couple of months ago and been hooked ever since! Surprised I waited that long, since I always enjoyed spending time by the water and outdoors in general.  I already have 3 rods, net and a bunch of lures  but for the time I've spent fishing (which is a LOT for the short period) I haven't had too much luck, or so it feels - came home too many times with out catching anything. Probably because I don't use warms (or other life bait) but I don't find it too exciting to catch small fish or sitting and waiting for a bite, I've been using spoons and spinners most of the time...  I'm in Hamilton and really interested in going for pike and eventually muskie. I got one at Binbrook and would like to get more  I've been once to Mountsberg, Guelph lake and Fanshawe but no luck at all!  Can anyone suggest a good spot not too far and lures/ techniques to use?"

710937,woodenboater,2012-07-02 18:05:00,2277,I like white or chartreuse spinner baits and crankin raps.

710952,Black_Blade,2012-07-02 18:53:00,258,"Spinnerbaits parallel to weed lines should get you some hits, but don't cut yourself off some great action of live baits like worms and minnows!"
