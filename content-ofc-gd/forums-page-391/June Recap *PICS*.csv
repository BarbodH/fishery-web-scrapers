The trucks are packed for load number 1 and the wife is still sound asleep, so I'll write up about June before I pack this thing away.  May saw some slab crappies and slob pike, but June is always my favourite month!  BASS OPENER!  Before bass opener, I still had 3+ weeks to kill.  Back up to Muskoka I went to chase down some big gators again.  We had a few successful outings, but with the move coming up, I didnt get out as much as I would have liked, and took until bass opener to pack and prepare for the move.  Our pike success came targeting deep breaking shorelines close to spawning bays, the more undeveloped, the better.  We caught them on a variety of baits but once again, the X-Zone Mega Swammer accounted for the vast majority of our fish.  My buddy Darryl was able to land his new PB pike as well!       Then came bass opener, my favourite.  I didnt enter the Casey Cup this year, so I took the opportunity to join a Junior Bassmasters mentor tournament.  I had two members of the barrie junior bassmasters join me on the boat for a 5 hour tournament.  We had a blast catching smallies on crankbaits, topwaters and swammers.  Unfortunately, I knocked the switch for my back livewell recirculation and had 2 fish die in the heat without the recirc running.  That 1 lb penalty knocked us down from 20.30lbs to 19.30lbs, but it was still enough for first place and we all had a blast. Later that afternoon, since the tournament ended early, I had a friend meet me up at Simcoe. We went out and fished some new water for a few hours and got into some gooduns.  Wouldnt be my go-to spots, but good ones to know in the future.  Wednesday we had our first club tournament of the year on Simcoe, and what a tough day it was.  The wind was howling and the water in my zones had dropped all the way to 58F.  I had to make some switches but still managed some quality bites and was able to pull out another win, plus big fish at 5.80lbs.         Great start to the season, can't wait to get settled in Elmvale and get July started!"
