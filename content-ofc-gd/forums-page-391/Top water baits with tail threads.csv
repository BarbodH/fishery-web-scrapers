The large mouth were going crazy after this thing. All of my poppers have damaged or missing yellow strands of tail.I tried my live target frog,My top water white buzz bait with the two prop type blades,not a chance. Where do you get replacement tails?. Went to CT today picked up a couple new white spinner baits(lol),and a couple leaders and noticed the poppers are around $10 a piece. I have 5 that need there tails replaced.I noticed on my damaged ones theirs a band around the tails, but I'm sure it must be glued on as well.If I have to buy 1 or 2 I will ,but wouldn't mind trying to fix these ones if possible.Thanks ."
710756,Ralph Field,2012-07-02 00:42:00,1018,"Buy tails for spinner baits and use them. just put the tail on normally,instead of putting it on backwards as you would do with a spinner bait. I would use gorilla clue or epoxy to secure it."
710758,Dozer,2012-07-02 00:56:00,896,Tails always get ripped off.  I haven't found any difference between having the tail on or off.  My hula's have a white butt end  No tail.
710793,davey buoy,2012-07-02 08:26:00,5505," Where would you pick up spinner bait tails? And Dozer you never find any difference,interesting.I thought the tail would look like legs and the frog type popper would be complete. Thanks Guys."

710803,davey buoy,2012-07-02 11:28:00,5505, I guess I could pick up a dressed treble at CT to replace the rear treble if they have them.Thanks.
710806,lew,2012-07-02 11:56:00,12766, You can usually get the tails in most tackle shops Davey
710807,Ralph Field,2012-07-02 11:57:00,1018,If you Google spinner bait skirts you will get a lot of suppliers such as Barlowtackle.com. If your local tackle stores don't carry them they are easy to find on line. You may need to thin them out a bit before using them.
710819,Ainsley,2012-07-02 12:44:00,142,I've come to prefer the rebel pop-r to my hulapoppers. I've found replacement skirts at some tackle shops.
710821,davey buoy,2012-07-02 12:47:00,5505,I also have two fly poppers that need skirts as well. I'll find them somewhere.Thanks.
710823,Jer,2012-07-02 12:48:00,1426,  The Pop'R is my favourite as well. The skirt doesn't always last long on these as well. Dressed trebles for an X-Rap work well to replace the rear hook.
710921,hirk,2012-07-02 17:09:00,571,"I have lots of skirts $1 ea picasso and strike king as well as custom made,I may have some new hulla's to @$4 ea.. Just pm me"
710924,bare foot wader,2012-07-02 17:19:00,1354,"it's very easy to make your own dressed trebles, especially if you're paying 10 bucks for a 3 pack of dressed trebles a few times a season, something to consider and let's you customize them however you want"
