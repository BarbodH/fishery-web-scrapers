710855,Rod Caster,2012-07-02 14:02:00,5784,"camped on saturday night at a new lake....I couldn't catch a pike to save my life. Nor did I see or hear anything pike-like  of the lake. There was only one camp on the lake and some guy was trapping minnows. The bait fish volumes were amazing, so either there are no pike or they are well fed.   Yesterday we went to my favorite smallie lake to keep me and the fiance un-bored (is that a word). We snorkeled a bit, found some free lures, then journeyed around the lake. The action was essentially non-stop with over 30 fish boated and over one million strikes. A nice relief for this work-filled summer.                       ""He's splashing me!!"" hahaha     "
