It entered him in The Canada's Best Competition to win a trip to Las Vegas to have his truck in the SEMA show.  The pictures don't do it justice, there is about 100k into this truck. A lot of parts were hand made.  PLEASE vote for it!!! HERE          To keep it a little fishing related. His shop is a sponsor for the Fish-A-Thon"
