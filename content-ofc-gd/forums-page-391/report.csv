710850,fishnsled,2012-07-02 13:46:00,3520,Nice report and congrats on your first pike!
710854,Acountdeleted,2012-07-02 14:01:00,2562,Congrats on the fish. Nice pike and an enjoyable read. Good luck in the tourny next week $2500 could buy a sweet Jon boat plus a 4 horse.
710856,Christopheraaron,2012-07-02 14:02:00,3525, Thank what I'm hoping!
710656,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 14:50:00,3525,"Was fishing orangeville reservoir to get ready for next week's tournament yesterday. We were out of the house by 6:30, launched the canoe by 7:45 and fishing by 8.  Wind was fairly calm and put us into a nice drift through the islands worms, topwaters and flipping crays weren't working so I started burning a white spinnerbait across the weedbeds. Then around 9:30 fish on! I was expecting a 1.5-2.5 pound bass based on the fight but when it got to the surface I realized I had completed my 10 year quest and finally caught a pike! A scrappy guy around 20"" but never the less a pike!     He's off with lots of energy in about a minute and I start casting again. 2 casts later and I have another fish on! this one's a fighter he takes most of my rod under the boat to keep it on, and another pike!     With no action except for a 3 pound largemouth (no pics) we moved down to do a little shore fishing at conestoga dam and witnessed some kids land two 25""+ walleye, I reminded them that they had to be realeased and they actually seemed eager to do the right thing!  After that we headed to little lake in cambridge for some top water bass, after no action I decided to go to the old hook and worm for some fun with bluegill then finished the day off with this little guy.    "
710657,davey buoy,2012-07-01 14:55:00,5505,Looks like you had a fun day CK!!:thumbsup_anim:Those darn spinner baits EH.lol.
710660,lew,2012-07-01 15:16:00,12766,"Well done on catching your 1st ever bass Christopher, and good luck on the up-coming tournament too."
710661,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 15:20:00,3525,"1st ever pike, I'd have to be a pretty bad at fishing to never have caught a bass."
710665,tb4me,2012-07-01 15:43:00,3295,Way to go Christopher..Once you get the pike dialed in they only get bigger! What tourneyment are you going in
710671,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 15:56:00,3525,"island lake cons. area bass tourny, 300 participants top prize $2500! It'll be tough but yesterday I saw a nice 6 pound fish swimming around!"
710673,kickingfrog,2012-07-01 16:05:00,8333,Nice fish. I really like using polarized sunglasses to see structure and fish.
710676,Roy,2012-07-01 16:39:00,13728,You did good and a great report. Congrats to you! Hope you do well at the tourney. Thanks for sharing your day.
710683,Spiel,2012-07-01 17:13:00,9065,"Damn, I knew you were young but those pictures have me suddenly feeling very old....LOL  Good stuff Chris."
710691,woodenboater,2012-07-01 18:03:00,2277,"What didja do with Richmond Hill Fisher, is he on a time out  Good luck with the tourney next week and keep those photos coming.  btw, Swift Canoe ?"
710693,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 18:09:00,3525, Yup. 37 lbs.
710698,woodenboater,2012-07-01 18:26:00,2277,"hate you. my old Trailhead kevlar is 50 lol. if yer in the bow, who's stern, inquiring minds ha ha ?"
710699,lew,2012-07-01 18:28:00,12766," My mistake Christopher, I was thinking pike but my fingers typed bass.  It's a terrible thing when the mind gets old(er)"
710701,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 18:28:00,3525,That would be my mom. But she doesn't fish .
710702,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 18:29:00,3525," Money's in the mail, can't wait for that new (ish) rod!"
710704,woodenboater,2012-07-01 18:32:00,2277,yer lucky to have a mom that loves paddling while her kid washes lures  guess you hafta work harder to get her fishing as well eh ?
710706,Christopheraaron,2012-07-01 18:44:00,3525,I try but she apparently just likes watching me fish. I'm guessing that won't last long.
710719,woodenboater,2012-07-01 20:06:00,2277,you should drop hints that watching you fish would be much more comfortable for her in a full console Lund
710728,spincast,2012-07-01 20:48:00,3279,  . That one made me laugh out loud. Congrats on your first pike Christopher. It'll only get better from here. Nice report and good luck in the tourney.
710808,Live2fish85,2012-07-02 12:07:00,1633,Congrats on the pike man.
710813,Christopheraaron,2012-07-02 12:32:00,3525, She had better realize that soon enough! Canoes are nice for backcountry and small rivers but taking it out in places like rice lake ( with no keel I might add) is just borderline insane.
710827,woodenboater,2012-07-02 12:52:00,2277,"I win LottoMax, I'll buy your rents a 1825 Rebel XL"
710832,Rich,2012-07-02 13:06:00,3927,Now your quest upgrades to looking for a GIANT pike!  Good job !
710833,Christopheraaron,2012-07-02 13:08:00,3525,That's very kind of you although I suspect that you'll buy one first to replace your old wooden boat!
710835,woodenboater,2012-07-02 13:18:00,2277,"yup, pretty much although every now and then I get this crazy idea to ask Giesler if they would customize a boat with casting deck, walk through and camper top. like an aluminum full console but wooden."
