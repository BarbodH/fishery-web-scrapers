711041,RangerGuy,2012-07-03 01:52:00,564,Checked out the wiring in my Lund Alaskan this evening. Anybody know what these wires are for from the main panel?  Here's a pic from the wiring harness at the transom. I metered them all and the only ones that had power were the red & black leeds with the main power on or off.  
711075,DanD,2012-07-03 10:42:00,2223,"These are likely the connectors for some form of accessory that on your application is not there? Things like a power trim gage/meter, voltmeter and or keyed power for instrument panel? Call the manufacturer of either the boat or the motor depending on where this harness originates from and ask (likely have to buy) for a wiring diagram.  Dan."

711179,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-03 17:10:00,1107,Yeah they likely use the same harnesses on several different models I have several unused connectors on mine it looks like who ever rigged yours took more time than they did on mine everything works on mine it just looks sloppy .
