292809,holdfast,2009-01-15 22:04:00,1813,Gas just Spiked up 6 cents in Saskatoon without reason.  Here we go again.  Does anybody have an explanation or at least an excuse.  All I know it seems when I read something in Yahoo dealing with gas it goes up.  Its like advertising an excuse.  So now its 89.9 cents and I think less than forty a Barrel
292838,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-15 22:51:00,10439,Why? Crude is down under $35 a barrel. If anything it should still be dropping.
292851,charlied,2009-01-15 23:26:00,584,thats what I was thinking also!   A  5 year low and Gas goes up...weird!!!
