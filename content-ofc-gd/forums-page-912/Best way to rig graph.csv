293129,Sinker,2009-01-16 14:55:00,8692,"Do you have the suction cup mount for it?  I just mounted mine on some 1/2"" copper pipe. I made it into a T. One piece goes across the hole, the other goes down the hole with the ducer on it. I just drilled a hole in the bottom pipe, and used the same bolt that came with the transducer to bolt it on. Done deal, works great.  Sinker"
293152,mukluk,2009-01-16 15:44:00,196,The transducer on my x-67c has a hole near the top which I pass a shoe lace threw. Have approx. 18 inches and tape a loop in the top of it. Tape the tranducer cable to the shoe string but leave a bit of slack . Now install approx. 9 or 10 inches of black 1/2 inch foam pipe covering around string and cable between loop and transducer so it can slide up and down. Foam covering will float transducer straight and draw heat to keep from freezing in. Easy to transport as it can be folded up.
293164,River Rat,2009-01-16 16:05:00,161,"the best way to rig your regular skipper transducer for ice is to drill a hole 4 or inches into the ice forming a bowl, clear out the snow / shavings and fill it with water....cut a 5gal bucket about 4 inches up from bottom to make jerk cover for the transducer hole. Drill a hole (same size as cord) and use a saw to cut a slice from the outside to the center hole for the cord. Put the cord through the slice, into the ""cord hole"" and put the transducer in the water filled with the cover over the hole. This will delay freezing and keep snow out. Maek sure the face of the skipper is flat in the bottom of the ""bowl""......this way you are not dealing with the transducer in your jigging hole and it's easy to see if it's pointing the wrong way etc.............let the games begin.

293217,wallacio,2009-01-16 18:01:00,475,"As stated building a ""T"" from metal or wood works great.   If memory serves, you have the Humminbird 565?   You can also purchace an ice transducer for this unit for about $80 (LeBaron carries them).  BTW if anyone using these Humminbird units and is still using the expensive lantern batteries which only last for a few trips, I have a step-wise set of pictures on how to convert it to accept rechargeable gel cell batteries which are available at hobby shops (PM me for the pics).    I see that Humminbird also sells gel cells now as well."
