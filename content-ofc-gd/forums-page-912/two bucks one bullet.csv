292360,Markystang,2009-01-14 22:30:00,131,Nice shot!
292379,Leecher,2009-01-14 23:04:00,7832,"Thanks cityfisher for sharing  I thought also that the shooter would take both deer but it wasn't the case.... great shot by him and like he said, they don't deserve to dye that way.  Thanks again Leechman"
292430,wallyboss,2009-01-15 00:00:00,1095,Wouldn't that meat be horrible tasting after all that adrenaline?
292465,douG,2009-01-15 00:35:00,2693,"  Walleyeboss, no deers died in that video.  The point of the whole thing was that he shot the antler of a locked in buck, and saved them both as a result, since they both ranned away.  There was no meat, in other words.  I just read the rabid posts on the UTube, from many who couldn't bear to watch. The embarrassing thing was that they still had no idea how the whole story turned out, but still castigated the hunter for saving a coupla bucks."
292489,cityfisher,2009-01-15 00:54:00,959,lot of people judge too quickly..great job saving both bucks from certain exhaustion/starvation
292630,wallyboss,2009-01-15 14:03:00,1095,I was watching it at work with no volume and I tought that the 1st deer that ran away was the one that was hit.  OOOPPPSSS
292633,Stoty,2009-01-15 14:12:00,2910,"Wow, impressive. Kudos to that dude!"
292724,joonmoon,2009-01-15 18:56:00,528,"Should have left them alone...let nature take its course. Survival of the fittest. Isn't that why they have antlers in the first place...so they can joust for position and/or the right to mate with does? The strong genes will prevail. If they both died, then he could have saved himself the bullet. Now theres two bucks out there possibly gonna die from exhaustion and one of them is missing half its antlers. Then he could of had both of them in the freezer."
292732,Stoty,2009-01-15 19:25:00,2910,It's not natural when they are tangled in a fence.......
