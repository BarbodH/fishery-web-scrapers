293186,coreyL,2009-01-16 16:38:00,15,when your hunting moose in the yukon the population is alot greater so ur chances of nailing on like that is a lot greater just being able to call out a moose any size is a great challenge

292683,johnnyb,2009-01-15 16:32:00,3413,L'homme panache....that's awesome!
292693,richyb,2009-01-15 17:01:00,774,Is he the guy that has a moose hunting video ?  his name is Real and it is all dubbed voices into english.
292721,kemper,2009-01-15 18:46:00,2232,amazing hunting... but come on does the guy really need to blast away a trophy EVERY year
292727,richyb,2009-01-15 19:05:00,774,  Who goes hunting to shoot a small one ? Thats what seperates a good hunter from an average joe hunter. Being able to shoot trophy animals year after year.
292738,richyb,2009-01-15 19:47:00,774,   I just flipped to wild tv and found the answer to my question . His tv show is called THE RACKMAN. he is also a guide.
292740,kemper,2009-01-15 19:51:00,2232," this is what seperates hunters from non hunters...I REALLY need to learn to shut my yap on hunting posts  Nothing against hunting or (most) hunters, I guess there is just something about trophy blasting I dont like."
292748,Leecher,2009-01-15 19:59:00,7832, Thanks Richyb for the info   Yeah that's him
292752,kemper,2009-01-15 20:04:00,2232,Okay I got a question... how does one arrow take down a beast like that?  Im thinking it could wander around for some time before going down?
292757,Leecher,2009-01-15 20:13:00,7832," A broadside shot thru the lungs and heart will down any size moose.... if you're close enough, the arrow will go thru the animal.  They usually don't go too far before they drop."
292818,richyb,2009-01-15 22:25:00,774,  An arrow kills by slicing the organs causing the animal to die from blood loss Or suffication from blood in the lungs.  To them it feels like a bee's sting and then they get woozy and fall over. have you ever cut yourself with something really sharp and you dont really feel it for a few minutes ? ....  I have seen bucks get shot and then continue chasing a doe for 50 yards then fall over . So obviously they arent in pain if they are chasing poontang !!!!!!!!!!!!  Longest i have tracked an animal shot with a bow was maybe 200 yards. It wasnt a very good shot thats why it went so far. The deer i have shot have dropped between 40 and 60 yards.  I know if i have a record book animal in my sights hes going down .
292885,misfish,2009-01-16 00:14:00,29133,"Rich,What scope do you have there?"
292887,richyb,2009-01-16 00:18:00,774,   Thats on my dads x bow . Its the excaliber drop zone or vari zone or what ever they call it . The ones that comes in the package.  Has a dial on top for fps and you just turn it to what ever fps your bow is and it has 4 or 5 different crosshairs in it for the drop of the arrow.
292890,misfish,2009-01-16 00:25:00,29133,"Thanks Im not happy with my red dot,well, I forget to turn it off when Im done   ,so going to switch up next season. Nothing like getting to your stand and theres no light on"
292892,Roy,2009-01-16 00:33:00,13728,This is the dude's site for those who are interested. He has tons of videos also.  http://www.hommepanache.com/english/trophies.saml
292941,Mattones,2009-01-16 01:38:00,587,i just picked up an Excal crossbow tonight I'm thrilled!\  Still that guy must have some nice racks on his wall.
