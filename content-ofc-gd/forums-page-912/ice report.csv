292369,Rich,2009-01-14 22:50:00,3927,Buddy at work told me today that Granges (?) huts are out now as of Saturday
292472,danbouck,2009-01-15 00:40:00,4380,Drove by yesterday and some huts were out. I'm not trusted it myself yet!
292706,Brian,2009-01-15 17:53:00,33,"Hey guys,  I was out there on Sunday and yesterday.  Lots of ice, Not so many perch!  Caught alot of dinks but not many jumbo's.  Ice was 9 1/2"" out a mile and 6"" out 2 miles...... that was Sunday.  Yesterday at the 2 mile mark there was 8""  Hope this helps, so go get 'em  Later  Brian"
292713,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-15 18:16:00,2050,"Lots of fish being caught right now you just have to find 'em.  Like Brian said, lots of dinks hanging around but if you put in the time you'll get a good feed.  Personally I'd rather stick to smaller bodies of water because I fish on foot, but the huts are out if you're looking to rent one.  My wife's cousin owns Erie Bait Lmtd. in St. Williams so if I hear anything from him I'll let you know.  The rest of the week looks like we're going to have cold nights so there's going to be plenty of ice out there.  good luck, UF"
292964,chickenhawk,2009-01-16 02:05:00,612,"this past saturday i along with 2 buddies walked out about 2 miles and did some fishing, only caught 3 fish but there were lots of huts and lots of quads and sleds and lots of ice out there......we have also rented a hut for this weekend coming.....ALL SYSTEMS GO!  oh yeah lol seen a deer walking on the ice jus behind my trailer in booth's harbour, kinda cool."
293304,Rich,2009-01-16 21:57:00,3927,You saw a deer and none of the yocals shot it? That's a rare day in LPB history. LOL
