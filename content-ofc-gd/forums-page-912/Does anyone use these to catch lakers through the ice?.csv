290625,Cudz,2009-01-11 04:40:00,2652,Are white tube jigs worth giving a try on Simcoe through the ice for lakers or is it a waste of time?  I have seen them used on other lakes in the spring.
290631,BassAsin,2009-01-11 05:07:00,806,"dont have a clue or know the first thing about simco, but i do know that white or a smoke grey tube works amazing for lakers just make sure u open the bail after the first hit u get they'll come back for it! let hit do the ""flutter"" down as if wounded   just  a personal experience may not work worth a darn on simcoe!  Matt!"
290634,irishfield,2009-01-11 05:13:00,26272,I think they work anywhere...  
290925,fishhunter,2009-01-11 22:59:00,604,"wayne 8"" white tubes are the best lol!!!! i got some for my lakers this year lol"
290934,irishfield,2009-01-11 23:06:00,26272,"That's a Monster Tube Lloyd... 10"" + trailer.  6"" work GREAT... 10"" should be even better."
290935,rhare,2009-01-11 23:07:00,387,They are deadly on simcoe
290940,Terry,2009-01-11 23:10:00,14456,I have tried on simcoe and have never caught any with them
290943,irishfield,2009-01-11 23:12:00,26272, Maybe it's not the fish....
290953,blakewalk,2009-01-11 23:27:00,86,"Thats a giant tube!  Ive landed a couple off BBP with 6""ers; never thought to go any bigger tho"
290954,solopaddler,2009-01-11 23:28:00,8605,"They work well everywhere. Sometimes they'll hit one with large sweeping jigs, but I've personally had my best luck kind of swimming them around the hole with the odd little twitch."
290956,irishfield,2009-01-11 23:29:00,26272,"I was ripping 3 to 4 foot lifts with my 6 "" last year when I got that 37"" laker."
291145,brkygetr,2009-01-12 03:58:00,425,ITS ALL I USE.....with the biggest minnow you got...sometimes the entire thing is a 8-10 inch mess
291296,OhioFisherman,2009-01-12 16:04:00,6623,"I sent DipLip some a few years back, white with silver fleck in them he was catching something on them thru the ice, can`t take credit for the lure though, he seems to know how to catch fish.  White is a good color spring summer fall for tubes."
291303,Fang,2009-01-12 16:16:00,1330,"White 5"" flipping tubes. These have the solid head and are best for slipping on the back of an airplane jig."
291317,anders,2009-01-12 16:43:00,1168,"For lakers in the winter its the first thing i go for.  Minnow or clean..they work well!  I find when i jig them make sure its a snap, not a gentle lift and drop.  Thats just me though."
292516,Eazy,2009-01-15 01:36:00,260,"Caught my biggest iced Laker on a 3.5"" white tube-jig!"
292547,douG,2009-01-15 02:34:00,2693,"OK, will get me some o dem ones,"
292552,Ramble,2009-01-15 02:41:00,713,what size weight are you guys using with these tubes?  -R-
292597,Eazy,2009-01-15 04:37:00,260,5/8oz. and up I believe.
292609,Bob,2009-01-15 06:51:00,370,A good sized white bucktail tipped with a minnow works real well in this neck o' the woods too.
292646,fishhunter,2009-01-15 14:45:00,604,"Terry its not the bait!!! I have seen first hand how you catch fish lol. Wait i am wrong, I have never seen you catch a fish lol"
