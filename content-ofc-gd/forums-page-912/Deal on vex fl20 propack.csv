I Used an ole fl8 for years and it was a great unit and I've heard and read all the crap about whats best for the ice. Me I'm a vex guy. but I don't doubt the other units on the market, the most important tip I give the ice fisher is get a sonar of any make it really dosn't matter as long as you have instant message to you, Marcum, Vexilar. Lowrence who cares!"

My advice to ANYBODY thinking about a Vex . . .    if this one is brand new in the box . . . . .    at THAT price, it'll likely be long gone by now, it it ain't . . . .    GRAB IT FAST!!"
