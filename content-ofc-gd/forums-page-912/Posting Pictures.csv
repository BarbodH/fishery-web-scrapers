If your pictures are huge, it'll automatically resize them.  A good size for the board is 800x600....you can choose this in Photobucket.  From there you need to copy code...do this by clicking on IMG Code as seen in this picture...   Once you've done that, you paste that into your report.  When you start your post, you'll see the posting window.  Simply paste into the spot you want to see the image...again here's a pic.   If the pictures whosn above are too small, click on them...you should be able to read what's on the screen...  Good luck!"
293106,forrest,2009-01-16 14:00:00,1032,By too large a size I am thinking you mean too large a file size. A lot of picture programs will ask if you want to change the quality of your picture when you save it as a jpg file.  People have said MS paint does this (not on windows here).  I remember that Irfanview will allow you to change bot the viewing size and the file quality (so file size). I use Gimp.  Forrest
