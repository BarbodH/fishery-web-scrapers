292087,solopaddler,2009-01-14 03:14:00,8605," Doubt there's a whole lot of difference in weight between those two. The anniversary reel is 43/4""..."
292415,salmon,2009-01-14 23:49:00,334," Solo Did you ever get a chance to weigh you 20th anniversay reel?  Plus the porting on the 20th, is so nice.  Jose"
291602,BillM,2009-01-13 02:45:00,17367,"The first time I fished with Sil, Dave and Berge they told me I'd be getting a new rod in no time.  I kinda just shrugged it off thinking, that my Raven would just do me fine.  Well, they were right   I got a line on a custom Loomis IM6 3 piece.  An old school rod from what I've been told, with a set back reel seat  (I really had no idea what I was buying, lol).  I got the approval from Mike and his buddy Fergie, so I guess I lucked out!  First thing Mike did when we went down to fish some Lake E tribs, was grab it and start furiously cleaning the cork!   He said nothing like clean cork to make a rod feel new again..  Today, I picked up another piece to the arsenal, a AngSpec 4.5 offset...  I blame Okuma-Sheffield for this and his thread on centerpins!!!!    Picked it up tonight, couldn't be happier.  Just spent the last 2 hrs taking it apart, greasing and giving it the once over.  This thing spins forever, there is just no other way to say it.  I cannot wait to get out on the water for the maiden voyage..  So who wants to go fishing!?!?!    "
291605,irishfield,2009-01-13 02:49:00,26272,Another one hooked !! lol  and   
291606,BillM,2009-01-13 02:51:00,17367,"Wayne, you just made me spit coke all over my keyboard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm gonna leave that just the way it is"
291612,tibbs,2009-01-13 03:07:00,650,"Wow,  That is one beautiful reel!  :worthy:  Congrats!"
291613,drwxr,2009-01-13 03:10:00,453,"congrats on the reel, it really is beautiful and a fine piece of art... looks like steelheading is becoming a runway show...   p.s dont forget to get insurance on that"
291615,solopaddler,2009-01-13 03:13:00,8605,"That's not what I said, but I will admit that the 10 plus years of ground in filth and roe goo had to go!  I was surprised you didn't buy the reel right away when you picked up the rod. Even more amazed that it was still available (Bill stole it from the guy  ).  Good on ya brother, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with it!"
291622,MJL,2009-01-13 03:21:00,2427,Congrats on the purchase.  Definitely a fine piece that should last you a lifetime worth of memories + more   Not always the case...I got my reel in stealth fighter black to remain invisible in the woods
291623,solopaddler,2009-01-13 03:27:00,8605,"Forgot to mention, but that reel will really balance that rod out nicely. With the reel seat set so far back the offset reel will balance better than your standard reel as it sits further forward...  It's no wonder the guy had that rod/reel mated together..."
291624,silvio,2009-01-13 03:28:00,433,Nice I am gonna start my custom rod soon and then get my ang specs. Nice choice bill well test it out soon.
291626,KelfuN,2009-01-13 03:31:00,246,oh man..you dont know how jealous i am right now!!!  don't let me see u on the river bud..lol
291627,kemper,2009-01-13 03:33:00,2232,"Looks like a beauty to me!  I have one of these new set up posts to do myself, as I aquired some new bling over the christmas season."
291632,snag,2009-01-13 03:59:00,1932,With such a tool at your disposal our expectations are higher!
291636,okumasheffield,2009-01-13 04:06:00,318,"Come on, BillM  STOP blaming it on me so that your wife/kids would think it was not your fault to buy such a beauty!  I guess Kemper and I are the only ones who cry when seeing AS reels .. coz' BillM just buy it without any tears!  AS reels are cheap comparing to so-called 'Engagement Rings' or 'Wedding Bends', haha"
291639,solopaddler,2009-01-13 04:12:00,8605," Billy doesn't have that problem (yet).  But for those that do, remember it's always easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission  ."
291697,canadian_copper,2009-01-13 12:13:00,925,ENJOY BRO!!!
291702,danbo,2009-01-13 12:32:00,2646,I guess a Clough is next?  Sweet reel ya got!
291711,BillM,2009-01-13 13:30:00,17367," You're killing me man, Mike makes me look like I know what I'm doing.  If it wasn't for him, I'd still be out on the Notty cursing and swearing.  "
291714,Steel28,2009-01-13 14:04:00,160,"Enjoy your Angspec Bill, I have one myself (4"" offset antireverse) and love it"
291793,jdmls,2009-01-13 17:59:00,575,Told ya u would breakdown before spring
291795,diggyj,2009-01-13 18:02:00,548,Sweet looking outfit!
291984,okumasheffield,2009-01-14 00:17:00,318,"went to Tom's place to take another look at that beauty ..  4"" offset anti-reverse .... it spins forever ... cried again .."
292062,ironstone74,2009-01-14 02:38:00,201,"Atta boy Bill,  Sick set-up.  New fishing gear is always a good investment... just don't let her find out how much you spent  Paul"
292068,BillM,2009-01-14 02:46:00,17367,Thanks Paul!  I gotta get out and give this thing a shot.  Hopefully it performs as good as it looks.
292083,salmon,2009-01-14 03:10:00,334, Bill  I advise you not to let you dad use that one or you will be looking for another one LOL!!  I had a 4 1/2 offset and sold it it was too heavy for me. I am on the lookout for their 20th anniversary reel.   Jose
292086,BillM,2009-01-14 03:13:00,17367,"Jose, luckily for me the oldman isn't to fond of standing in the middle of a frozen river  I hope the weight isn't a big issue, I did put it on the rod and it seems extremely well balanced.  Most likely because of the reel seat being further back then normal.  I let my oldman use the Calais, bad...bad idea!!!  lol"
