292911,joonmoon,2009-01-16 01:01:00,528,I'm pretty sure that BPS doesn't sell the parts for these heaters...as a matter of fact I was there last Thurs and they don't even have any of the heaters left. The sale sold all of them. I went to Princess Auto to get mine. If you look up the manufacturer I'm sure they will be able to help you out.
