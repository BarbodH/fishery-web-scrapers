293200,Billy Bob,2009-01-16 17:15:00,5865," I thought i would of read "" Canadian Air Force Downs Commercial Aircraft out of NYC"""
292782,misfish,2009-01-15 21:17:00,29133,"WOW What a great job the pilots did, to do a control crash. 164 + people survived. They are saying a flock of Canadian geese took it down."
292784,Lowe Rider,2009-01-15 21:23:00,79,"Just seen the footage, the pilot deserves a medal getting that 320 in the water in one piece. Saved a lot of lives, people shown waiting on the wings to be rescued. Just amazing."
292810,Joey,2009-01-15 22:09:00,9122,Flipping Canadians!!!  Glad everyone is okay.  That would change your outlook on life for sure.  Joey
292816,irishfield,2009-01-15 22:22:00,26272,Canadian Terrorists Down A320 Airbus in New York will be the headlines.  Damn Canada Geese..... and a great glide and slide. Kudos to the crew !
292819,Big Cliff,2009-01-15 22:25:00,6899,Anyone got a link to that footage?
292820,irishfield,2009-01-15 22:28:00,26272,It's on CNN... bell xpressview 500.  cnn.com I imagine
292822,Big Cliff,2009-01-15 22:32:00,6899,Thanks Irish!
292823,Nemo,2009-01-15 22:33:00,727,
292824,OhioFisherman,2009-01-15 22:34:00,6623,"Should be on cnn, msnbc, watching it since it happened, a great job by all parties involved. Ferry boats there to rescue passengers in just a couple minutes."
292847,Big Cliff,2009-01-15 23:22:00,6899,"You really have to wonder how; with no power, all those boats using the river, and at such a low altitude, that pilot managed to turn that plane and land it under control without hitting any boats and with no loss of life? Man it just boggles the mind! I guess the lesson here is: No matter how bad things seem don't ever give up!"
292850,Daplumma,2009-01-15 23:25:00,1961,Nothing short of a miracle.No lives lost ditching a plane in NYC.Those pilots have some skills. Joe
292864,Roy,2009-01-15 23:44:00,13728,"I just watched an hour of the videos and different perspectives and I'm still teared up from gratitude to the pilots, the crew and all of the rescue people involved. The whole thing was just surreal. Nevermind the forced landing, just stepping off the plane in those temperatures could kill you. Lots to be thankful for tonight for sure.  Unbelievable...."
292872,irishfield,2009-01-15 23:59:00,26272,Some good stuff for sure Roy... but I gotta turn it off. Can't handle anymore of the sensationalism !  Pilot did a great job of bringing her around and taking the best pick that he had for a landing spot. Something that goes thru a pilots mind (consciously or subconsciously) at least once a minute... or at least it should. He got one shot at it and getting it right the first time... PRICELESS !
292918,Raf,2009-01-16 01:07:00,3495,"incredible!  with the speeds these airliners fly at i can't imagine how difficult putting that plane down in the water with such minimal damage was.  i occasionally go to/through laguardia, fly AA, could have easily been me on that plane."
292924,irishfield,2009-01-16 01:18:00,26272,You got that right Raf. Normal landing speed for the A320 is 150 Knots on short final approach. Take off rotation speed under full power is 130 knots. Absolute minimum to float that sucker along in ground (water) effect above the water would most likely be 110 knots (~127MPH). (I have 4 hours in the air and 5 hours simulator in an A320....Thanks to Skyservice and Air Canada respectively).  I wish someone had of got the landing on video... as I suspect that the flare angle was perfect and it slide along on the engine nacels and the tail for a bit before breaking the water surface... it had to or there would have been a different outcome IMHO.
292992,OhioFisherman,2009-01-16 03:14:00,6623,"Roy your right, they should be re-naming the airport after that pilot right now! Hard to imagine a clear head to avoid the buildings and get that sucker down somewhere sort of safe."
293006,douG,2009-01-16 03:41:00,2693,"Wayne, how do you practise that sort of landing?  'You'll get it right next time, Chipper. Don't give up,'."
293012,irishfield,2009-01-16 03:51:00,26272,LOL Doug... Land it like you should land them all .. perfect! Not that it happens...but they got it right on this one and I can guarantee it wasn't on autoland because the brakes never came on... it went 5 miles after landing.
293024,hammercarp,2009-01-16 04:06:00,964,"Just heard that that plane has an emergency system that closes all bottom compartments when the ""ditch switch"" is flicked on. Good thouhtful engineering."
293058,Greencoachdog,2009-01-16 10:09:00,8163,"If y'all will notice, that pilot is an old man!!!  Never underestimate the powers of an old man!!! He did a damn good job saving all those peoples lives!!!   I just can't help but think that if it had been a younger pilot, they may not have fared as well."
293061,Big Cliff,2009-01-16 10:48:00,6899," Well the reason he is an old man is because he is such a good pilot, the lousy pilots don't usually live long enough to get to be old men!"
293066,Greencoachdog,2009-01-16 11:51:00,8163, That was my point Cliff.  Had it been a younger pilot...
293070,OhioFisherman,2009-01-16 12:12:00,6623,According to news reports here a former fighter pilot and has a side job teaching people not to panic?
293191,fishindevil,2009-01-16 16:57:00,6254,"AMazing pilot for sure,and he was even the last guy off the plane after he double checked that there was nobody left !!!! he will be getting a medal of bravery for sure,glad everyone was ok !!!  i have watched all the footage too...cheers"
293198,irishfield,2009-01-16 17:12:00,26272, He should Shawn.. but the way the FAA works they'll take his licence away instead ....because he didn't have a multi-engine seaplane endorsement.
