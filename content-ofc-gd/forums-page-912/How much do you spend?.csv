292970,tschirk,2009-01-16 02:40:00,261,Let's just say that my GF asked me to leave it in my will it to her so she can open a fully stocked tackle shop...lol!
292976,Bernie,2009-01-16 02:48:00,3190,"Hmm . Make my own jigs and bought a few thousand hooks 4 years ago at the fishing show. Think they were around $50 bucks. Get my lead from wheel wieghts (free). Powder paint lasts a long long time and have a dozen or so colours. Buy a flat of worms in the spring. A couple bags of snap swivels. Maybe some new fishing line. Annual tackle costs? $100 bucks, maybe. The lid on my tackle box mostly collects dust. Just use a Plano container for the jigs. But I do end up with the odd plateful of pickerel.Yummmm."
292980,irishfield,2009-01-16 02:51:00,26272,Speaking of jigs Bernie... when's your next production run ?? lol
292989,Bernie,2009-01-16 03:09:00,3190,We usually do them up in March Wayne. But it can happen just about anytime the guys get together to do an assembly line run. You want to come up and join the assembly line union?
292990,irishfield,2009-01-16 03:11:00,26272,You never know Bernie... if it coincides with a trip North I could sleep on one of the boat seats in the showroom! lol
292997,KelfuN,2009-01-16 03:25:00,246,"i spent about $800 ever since i got into steelheading.  when i had my normal fishing seasons, i spend maybe about $200-300 per year buying new rods, reels, baits and lines"
293000,salmon,2009-01-16 03:30:00,334,"I am pretty well set for my reels, Steez, Calais and a CuradoE5. Next thing is to spend @ $600 - 800 for a couple of rods. St. Croix Tournaments or Elites  Jose"
293025,sonny,2009-01-16 04:07:00,511,don't ask!!  I don't even want to know that!
293034,2 tone z71,2009-01-16 04:34:00,1311,"last yr WAY too much on new Muskie rigs and tackle,nothing so far this yr but I got a few hundred in gift cards that will get me in the store then who knows hahaha"
293036,danc,2009-01-16 04:37:00,4677, Yup. Me too.
293037,Cudz,2009-01-16 04:40:00,2652,$50 bucks a month.  I am on a budget. I recently bought a nice im6 rod and reel for $24.  Also bought a one piece im6 7' heavy casting rod for $19.99. So far this year I have spent about $50 since Christmas. Need to save next month though for the BPS spring sale.
293038,irishfield,2009-01-16 04:48:00,26272, Yah... but you only need one hook for your style of fishin bud!
293041,danc,2009-01-16 05:01:00,4677," And that one hook catches me Walleye, Brook Trout, Steelhead, Pike, Whitefish, Perch, Bass....  And I don't just use one hook per year Wayne. Sometimes I'll go through 4 or 5 of them in a year."
293047,irishfield,2009-01-16 05:17:00,26272, 
293086,NAC,2009-01-16 13:02:00,369," Kemper, $75+tx will get you a brand new 12'6"" Shimano convergence, w/ Fuji guides and a lifetime warranty.  I just picked one up before Xmas for chuckin bigger floats with bulk shot. There not pretty, but very functional.  ____________   I'll probably spend just under $1000 before season opener and about that much again before the end of the year. $250 has come my way via BPS gift cards. Part of that will include a new fish finder and the rest will be drop-shot rod, jigging rod, a pair of baitcasters for them and of course a bit of tackle."
293099,forrest,2009-01-16 13:36:00,1032,"Well, I have not been buying fishing stuff for all that long so my number would be off....I think I will spend $300, if I get the reel I need.  In a couple of years I hope the number to level off at $50 max per year and work with the tackle I have and still be prepared for everything.  It is disappointing to look at some of the items I have and realise that I have never caught a fish on them.  When I was a kid I had tons of fun on $200 worth of tackle total and that includes a rod/reel!  All the terminal tackle I needed could fit into my pocket.  Having all this extra tackle is a luxury, sometimes a burden.  I like this thread.  forrest"
293115,jwl,2009-01-16 14:27:00,1056,"are we talking just tackle and bait here?, or the whole spectrum? because I am sure that many of us don't even want to add it all up in the long haul  I don't..or at least I don't in front of my wife   .....first there is site fees for my trailer lot,trailer insurance, boat insurance,fuel for 2 boats,fuel to get back and forth to the trailer, that all adds up to a good couple grand or so   ....20-25 bucks a week in the summer just in bait for me and the kids....top off the kid's tackle boxes(then they score my stuff too for some reason). My tackle top ups for the year depend on what I am fishing for could range from a dollar pack of hooks to a 25 dollar musky bait depending on my needs at the time..... I knew I didn't want to start adding it all up"
293119,Sinker,2009-01-16 14:36:00,8692,Fishing for me is a lifestyle. I spend pretty much every thing I can on it. I would never add it up.  Time on the water is priceless!!!  Sinker
293187,fishindevil,2009-01-16 16:39:00,6254,"Well lets just say that fishing is the reason i dont own my own house !!!!! thousands & thousands of dollars,like the saying goes:  it really is a full blown addiction isnt it ?????  my only regret will be when i die that my wife will sell all my fishing tackle for what i told her i payed for it !!!!!!"
292677,diggyj,2009-01-15 16:22:00,548,How much do people spend on fishing stuff between now and the spring opener?
292679,Stoty,2009-01-15 16:29:00,2910,If you talking about boats too...then...WAY TOO MUCH!
292681,bassjnkie,2009-01-15 16:30:00,1101,"Sorry can't answer that, the GF knows my password.LOL. From Jan 1 to mid April, I would say $1500+, mostly all match/carp fishing stuff. It's not a lot considering it's comes from the UK. I have a budget though."
292697,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-15 17:14:00,3761,Between boxing day and spring opener i spend about $175-$225 every year. This year i spend about $190 so far and i think i am prepared for spring/summer. But there's always a couple bucks spent at the fishing classic at BPS.
292698,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-15 17:16:00,2038,Lots
292701,danbo,2009-01-15 17:28:00,2646,"Every spare nickel!     can you say ""Upgrading""."
292711,anders,2009-01-15 18:12:00,1168,I prefer not to think about it...that way it doesnt seem like a lot when i try to add it all up....if i add it all up.
292717,Moosebunk,2009-01-15 18:40:00,3970,10 KATRILLION BAJILLION DOLLARS!!!  
292719,kemper,2009-01-15 18:42:00,2232,"as much as I need to....?  generally not alot, I havent bought any new summer gear (as in rods/reels) for a while now but I guess the float gear  I buy makes up for it.  Speaking of float gear I need (want?) another rod...looking for a 12 and a half footer thats used and CHEAP"
292723,rob v,2009-01-15 18:51:00,535,I try not to keep track.
292728,BassAsin,2009-01-15 19:08:00,806,i'd have to say that last year alone on soft plastics i spent somewhere around 750       800 on a couple new rods and reels    200 on live bait on the hardwater 150 on new line 300 on body baits and jigs and a couple new tackle boxes 150 on wide gap hooks and this doesnt count gas to and from mainteneance on boat truck canoe ....  so just on fishing in genereal  somewhere around $2350.00  Matt!
292729,BassAsin,2009-01-15 19:11:00,806,when i add all mine up and divide by 12 i get 200 now divide by 4 and i get 50  so about 45-50 bucks a week cheaper than being a smoker i suppose!            too bad i do both
292730,LeXXington,2009-01-15 19:16:00,1928,Just my wife's retirement saving
292731,capt bruce,2009-01-15 19:22:00,820,"What moosebunk said . I just moved and when all my fishing stuff was put together even the  movers were scared at all the stuff 50+ rods and reels 75 tackle boxes etc. etc., maybe one day I will open a store , when the young guys were showing pics of their rapellas I looked at my closet I lost count at 1000 and I dont even like Raps that much , you should see my lucky crafts -I like them lol (just dont tell the wife how much it all costs, got it at a lawn sale lol) .  dont want think about it ."

292749,shane,2009-01-15 19:59:00,652,A fresh spool of line and a new sticker for my card and I'll be good to go.  So.....about $25.00.  A cheap date.
292756,tdotfisherman,2009-01-15 20:10:00,317,"Last year I spent about $300.00 between Jan 1 and Opener i'd say  so far this year I've spent $210.. ($150 of that being Christmas gift cards)  from now until opener, and pretty much all year I'm going to limit my spending on fishing stuff, because I'm saving up to buy a boat, and most of my money is going towards that, seeing as my projected boat buying month would probably be June or Early July.."
292765,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-15 20:38:00,3761,"1000 Rapala's are you kidding me  Would you care to share some for next season    Seriously if i ever get that many lures i will cry lol, Each rapala can be about 8 bucks a piece....8 x 1000=$8000!"
292781,uglyfish,2009-01-15 21:16:00,981,"i don;t even wanna think about how much i spend... and since i fish year round, there is no down time to sit and think about it. lol, i;m always out buying things... in the past week alone i;ve spent.... about $400, with more to come as i;m planning on gettin an ice hut soon, so theres another 500, plus heater, sonar, and a GPS unit i have my eye on... oh dear... my wife is goin to kill me. lets not get started on open water gear since i have channel cats, then walleye, pike and then bass and muskie season to worry about."
292825,Muskieman,2009-01-15 22:35:00,2472,I'll spend about 1200.00 on gear alone for the whole year.....I lose about 500.00 of that stuff during the first week of fishing..  :wallbash:  1200.00  is excluding the boating stuff such as gas and oil and regular maintenance..and tournament costs  All tolled I'm looking at about 2500.00 - 3000.00 /yr.  My wife says it's more if I include the beer for when I get off the water.  RFS 
292832,OhioFisherman,2009-01-15 22:48:00,6623,"LOL my beer budget went to tackle. Not spending any money on it lately but winter was get ready season, nothing worse than spending fishing time out looking for tackle.  A trip to BPS, Cabelas, Netcraft instead of the sportsman show, 300 bucks? Couple hundred at the local tackle shop, a hundred bucks maybe at the local flea market."
292862,ecmilley,2009-01-15 23:43:00,2163,"hmm never thought about it but usually pick up at least one rod and reel combo between softwater seasons this year i replaced two rods or three, picked up a carrot six, crucial, avid, mactched with a stella, stradic and curado, only the carrot stix and stella have seen use in september the others are still virgins, as for tackle so far about 12 bags of strike zones, 3 buckets of power bait several packages of bio bait and a whole bunch of spinnerbaits and top water stuff before opener still need 3 spools of power pro, 5-6 packages of drop shot hooks, sinkers some rapalas maybe another rod, need a new trolling motor another fishfinder sheesh it never ends"
292966,Zubris21,2009-01-16 02:14:00,563,"I think I've spent about $200 since Christmas, and that was all on hard water gear.  Maybe 30 bucks was for softwater.  I expect to spend another couple hundred at least come spring time.  Looking to get a new rod/reel for fishing the steelies / salmon run in the spring and then everything I need for when I get back to ONT."
292969,irishfield,2009-01-16 02:35:00,26272,I don't know... just received the 2009 BPS master catalogue today in the mail... I'll let you know ! lol
