292546,Fisherman,2009-01-15 02:33:00,7201,"There's a Canadian dealer list on the Otter website, however, be prepared to rob a bank first, their price was nuts and shipping crazier.  I ordered mine direct from Otter last Friday, here this morning at 11. It is the Ice cabin 2 person model."
292585,sirfish,2009-01-15 03:57:00,175,"Wiser they are far and few around Ontario. I purchased the otter Walleye series 2 man about 2 yrs ago at The outdoor store in Welland ,Ontario. It is awesome. Lots of room and square tube aluminum construction . Sets up in minutes. Fits in the back of the van. Hope this helps. Give gander mountain a call ,they carry the otter sleds maybe they know of one in stock.....Thom"
