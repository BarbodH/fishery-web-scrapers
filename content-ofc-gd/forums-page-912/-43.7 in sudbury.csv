292443,Mike01,2009-01-15 00:17:00,378,"it was almost -40 here in North Bay this morning, and its going to be pretty cold the the few days as well."
292513,bigredfisher,2009-01-15 01:29:00,300,HOLY CRAP...... it was 4 here in st. johns newfoundland but lots of wind (65km/ hr)
292514,Sinker,2009-01-15 01:34:00,8692,"When me and  Buckster got to simcoe this morning, the mercury was at -29C. Didn't see too many guys out there for some reason???  I'm going again in the morning.   Sinker"
292528,rickster,2009-01-15 02:01:00,495,forecast for here tonite is -51f with the windchill
292590,holdfast,2009-01-15 04:12:00,1813,"Welcome to the Cold Fellas.  Thought we were the Only ones.  I'm really used to the Minus 30s now.  You'd be surprised on how your Canadian Body can Acclimatize in a couple of days.  I dont mind the Cold, its that freaking wind.   I wonder if the poor little Polar Bears are still Drowning up North.  Just seen a Commercial of one."
292610,Bob,2009-01-15 07:17:00,370,"Apparently there were four in total, Polar bears drowned that is, got caught offshore in the same storm.  There are nearly five times as many polar bears today as there were sixty years ago or so.  Global warming stopped a decade ago and climate changes.  Always has, always will.  Some of you older fellas here must remember the headlines and magazine articles from the early seventies that tried to scare us all to death with a new ice age coming?  In the twenties it was global cooling and in the thirties the Arctic was melting, the seals were disappearing and all the polar bears and eskimos would starve.  Seems they made it ok.  It's a crock of crap!!!"

292736,bigugli,2009-01-15 19:36:00,6138,"We are just having ourselves a traditional, good ole fashioned winter like we used to get 30, 40 and 50 years back. There were a lot of Muskoka nights when the needle passed -40F. We were taught to never sit on the seat in the honey hut at night. No one was gonna hear you crying for help once you got stuck.  Some useless facts. Want to know how cold it really is. Spit into the snow. Warmer than -40 it will freeze on contact. Colder than -40, you'll hear a pop as it freezes in mid air. At that temperature, waxed handlebar mustaches get brittle and snap off."
292742,BUSTER,2009-01-15 19:52:00,1336,"ABSOLUTE COLD IS THE REAL COLD! -459.67 deg.F,  anything else is just lacking heat!"

292783,canadadude,2009-01-15 21:18:00,769,"you are so full of crap uglie the winters in the 30,40 and 50 yrs back were no different then what we are enjoying now, the only difference is the bullcrap we tell our kids , like this cold front we have today in 10 or 15 years the parents will be telling there kids how cold it was and how much snow there was"

It's 12*F here right now and my tan is really suffering!!!  If y'all keep it up, I'm going to send you some nice Gulf of Mexico moisture up there.. and you know what'll happen then!"

292185,diggyj,2009-01-14 15:03:00,548,"Im sure that is cold.   Was a balmy -23 C here this morning and the weather announcers made it seem like it was the apocolypse over again. Really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Like you mentioned, very dry cold. Just put on the hat and gloves and I wasn't feeling cold at all."
292190,walleyejigger,2009-01-14 15:23:00,876,"a balmy -29 now, gonna head to the hut in about 10minutes, wish me luck........ not for fish, but that i survive lol"
292195,irishfield,2009-01-14 15:39:00,26272,"I was gonna head to Temagami tomorrow morning... but we've called that off already based on the forecast...   We can sit huddled around the fire here, with a broken furnace, instead.."
292198,LeXXington,2009-01-14 15:46:00,1928,"hummmm, wonder how many babies will be born 9 months from now?"
292201,Governator,2009-01-14 16:04:00,879,  I know for a fact that in 8 months there will be at least 1...

292221,blakewalk,2009-01-14 16:52:00,86,"-44 eh?! Sounds like global warming changed its mind.  I am quite fond of the cold myself, provided my lips dont freeze to my teeth when I step out to get the mail."
292228,diggyj,2009-01-14 17:15:00,548," Congrats Governator, I think!"

292261,Mattones,2009-01-14 19:00:00,587,"It felt like framing in Alberta again. We were finishing off the roof of a house at the construction site from 8am-1pm i swear i thought my face, toes and fingers were going to have frost bite. While my co-worker sat inside cutting the sheets for me. Man was I sour. Plus we were backing on to a huge empty feild!"
