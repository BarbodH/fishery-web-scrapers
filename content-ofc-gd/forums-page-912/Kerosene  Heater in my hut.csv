292596,Cudz,2009-01-15 04:34:00,2652,I have a hut that does not have great ventilation.  It is a 2 man hut and I have a kerosene heater.  Is there a definate risk in using this type of a heater.  The heater is older but it really pumps out the heat.  I sat in it for a good while tonight in my garage to see if there would be an effect.  I didn't fall asleep lol.  The fumes stink but I heard that the longer it runs the more efficiently it burns (as long as there is new oxygen present).  I am not sure if I am high typing this but I still smell the fumes.  They are in my clothes.  I think I taste them too. Maybe I just answered my post.  Probably not a good source of safe heat.

292644,joonmoon,2009-01-15 14:39:00,528,I'm not exactly sure but if you are tasting the fumes then breathing them in for any length of time prolly isn't too healthy for ya. I would go with a propane heater...like Mr. Buddy.
