291882,Rich,2009-01-13 21:11:00,3927,"Just a quick one.. headed out to the Urban Fisherman's favourite stomping grounds for some perch action with my buddy Mark. First few drops yielded 3 decent perch.. then they moved away and the bass moved in and wouldn't go away. We moved from that spot and the bass followed us, because the largies continued hitting. Sheesh. I think I caught more yesterday than I do most days during the summer. Probably ate my perch, little Bandits.  Anywho, it was good for the first 5 minutes. After about 3 bass it was more frustration than anything. All were released of course. We headed home after an hour of the seemingly unavoidable bass.  "

291921,Rich,2009-01-13 22:32:00,3927,"Perch are still on the back porch actually, I've been too lazy to fillet them.. haha"
291924,misfish,2009-01-13 22:33:00,29133,The word MEOW come to mind.LOL
291932,snag,2009-01-13 22:39:00,1932, That's what I was thinkin!
291938,Leecher,2009-01-13 22:52:00,7832,Great report and pic Rich  What were you using as bait to get the perch and bass?  Was it live or artificial? Were you able to test out the fry?  Colorful perch by the way Jacques
291956,joonmoon,2009-01-13 23:14:00,528,"Good job Rich, wondered when you were gonna get out there and hammer the pannies."
291983,Rich,2009-01-14 00:16:00,3927, Just a gold jigging spoon.. they wouldn't take the bait nearly as fast as a spoon - the perch that is lol don't want to give the impression I was bass fishing.
291988,Leecher,2009-01-14 00:25:00,7832, Cool Rich     Keep them reports coming
291990,diggyj,2009-01-14 00:26:00,548,Thanks for that great report. Looks like some great perch again.
292029,Rizzo,2009-01-14 01:41:00,4754,"nice job Rich, hearing about lots of bass through the ice this winter"
292309,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-14 20:46:00,709,nice to see you brought them home at least.  iv seen some people throw the perch on the ice let them freeze to death and leave them there at the end of the day.  what a waste!
292371,Rich,2009-01-14 22:51:00,3927,lol there's been a few times when that's the only meal I've brought home is the fish others left
292372,limeyangler,2009-01-14 22:56:00,5204,great stuff Rich...i've still to catch a bass through the ice.  Good looking supper there.  Lol...i've never left fish out onthe porch overnite
292438,irishfield,2009-01-15 00:09:00,26272, And a violation of the fishing act no less !
