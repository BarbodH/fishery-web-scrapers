292454,Riparian,2009-01-15 00:26:00,269,"I headed out to find some pike on a small pond near my place today. I arrived around 2pm, and only fished for around 2 hrs. The snow was about a foot and a half deep and there was no walking paths so travel was difficult.  Ive never caught a pike on a tip-up before, but I have tried a few times with no sucess. Today was the day i got my first one. I went to the deepest part of the pond, which was only about 6 ft deep and drilled my holes for my gear.  Set up my tipup with a quickstrike rig my friend gave me (thanks Beats)        I set up my sonar and my jigging hole about 15 ft from the tip up, and tried to catch some small fish that were showing up on the graph. I assume they were tiny perch. I was bouncing a lindy jig tipped with some berkley maggots but even that seemed to big for them as they would only knock it around down there.  So the windchill is about -25 so im sitting in my portable out of the wind. About an hour goes by and Ive totally forgotten about the tipup, which is what usually happens. Suddenly I hear this sound,  Ticktickticktick.  My first instict was ""what the hell was that"" and I start looking out the windows of the hut. Suddenly I remember the tip up and I run over to it to find this fella on the end of the line.      Strange feeling bringing in a big pike hand over hand. I love this method of fishing, but it takes great patience. Once he was out he stiffened up immediatly since it was so cold, it would have been nice to have a buddy to help get him unhooked. I did it though after not too much time, and he was released to be caught another day."
292463,Beats,2009-01-15 00:34:00,543,Nice fish.  A real fatty.  Must have taken up a good chunk of that hole.
292469,douG,2009-01-15 00:38:00,2693,"That was a nice pike, must have been a tussle.  Thanks."
292487,BassAsin,2009-01-15 00:52:00,806,thanks for the report! nice fish good and healthy lookin!   sluch? or just from you drilling the holes?
292491,cityfisher,2009-01-15 00:56:00,959,"nice pike! ... next time pick up a jaw spreader to make the unhooking alot easier, great tool!"
292494,Rizzo,2009-01-15 00:57:00,4754,nice looking pike for a pond with max 6 foot depths. I've got a similar one near my house and the pike are absolutely tiny
292498,Riparian,2009-01-15 01:00:00,269, There was alot of slush. The ice was about 8 inches thick but there was well over a foot of snow on it. When I drilled the holes water rushed up from it a little bit. I assume its from the weight of the snow on the ice.
292499,Riparian,2009-01-15 01:01:00,269, Ive been meaning to get one of those...
292501,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-15 01:05:00,3761,Very nice pike for sure!  Thanks for the report
292502,BassAsin,2009-01-15 01:05:00,806,get 2   one pair always seems to get left behind or at a buddies shack or on the last lakes shoreline! hahah
292572,Ramble,2009-01-15 03:25:00,713,"Nice fish for sure. Handlining pike is always a good time. Last summer handlining for walleye i got a 37 incher to the cradel by hand. That is a great pike for a small lake like that. I love forgetting about he setline, then having it go off, always good for a rush as you scramble for it lol.  -R-"
292647,joonmoon,2009-01-15 14:47:00,528,"Gotta luv it when the tip-up tips down and away you go. Handlining can be fun but I prefer the mini rod and reel. Way better control, good for you nice fish for sure."
292654,Zubris21,2009-01-15 15:05:00,563,Nice fat fish!  Sounds like you had a good time out there!
