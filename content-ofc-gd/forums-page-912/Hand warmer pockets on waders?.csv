Wonder why making zippered hand warmer pockets, the only thing I can come upp with is that those pockets might be warmer than others because it is one layer closer to the body (it is body -> hand warmer -> outer wader layer, instead of body -> outer wader layer -> hand warmer pocket) (Needless to say, it should be warmer than those on wading jackets as well)  However, if the weather is so cold that you would use hand warmer pocket, wouldnt you wear a fishing jacket as well? If so, how do you access the hand warmer pockets on the wader other than leaving your jacket un-zipped?  I guess the G5 jackets would have zippers to allow you stick your hands into 'wader hand warmer pockets  On well, I am crazy"

292733,FLEX ROD,2009-01-15 19:28:00,394,"Why make them with a zipper? You would be putting your cold hands into the hand warming pocket and first you have to get the zipper open and then you have to be carefull not to scrape your hands on the zipper.  As was said already, get some gloves.  FLEX - John"
292734,BillM,2009-01-15 19:33:00,17367,"I just stick those hand warmer packets in my wading jacket pockets.  If I get cold, I put them in there for a few seconds and heat them up.  One handed drifts!!!"
292760,purekgw,2009-01-15 20:16:00,585,no need for them tape the rod to your hand and fish till your hands go numb then you cant fell anything
292762,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-15 20:20:00,10439, So you can store things other than your hands in there and not have it fall out.
292768,FLEX ROD,2009-01-15 20:45:00,394," Thanks, but I think that with my vest and jacket I have anough pockets for!  All I am saying with a zipper and cold  hands you can and you will scrape your hands on the zipper sooner than later!  FLEX - John"
292946,okumasheffield,2009-01-16 01:44:00,318,Stop asking me questions as if I were the SIMMS designer ...  Drifter does have a good point ... to use the zippered hand warmer as extra pockeets

292998,KelfuN,2009-01-16 03:29:00,246,just buy some hand warmer heat pads...$1.29 for 2.  they will keep your hands warm all day long...better than hard warmer pockets!
