292008,Joeytier,2009-01-14 01:11:00,3990,"I'll heading down to quinte weekend after next, and I'd really like to have a fish finder to help find the fish, as its a bit harder than lakes such as scugog to read the depth simply by pulling up your line. I've been looking at this unit http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...mp;cmid=PP_P0_2, and I'm fairly close to purchasing it, as the price is certainly right.  I'm wondering whether or not anyone has this unit or others in the same price range to reccomend?  Thanks."
292010,scugpg,2009-01-14 01:19:00,1373,"I recently went through researching units and for a portable the Lowrance x67 unit is very hard to beat. It is more money, but its a very solid unit. http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPat...products_id=337"
292013,Joeytier,2009-01-14 01:23:00,3990,"Being a student on a minimum wage budget, I'm not sure I'm willing to spend quite that much money.   Woe is me."
292021,wallacio,2009-01-14 01:29:00,475,Go for the Humminbird...it's a good buy for your budget.  I have an older Matrix 20 portable which is basically the same unit.   I use it on small boats/canoes etc as well as on the ice...it'll track a little jig all they way down to 100'
292022,Joeytier,2009-01-14 01:31:00,3990,"Alright, thanks."
292027,Rizzo,2009-01-14 01:39:00,4754,"I've never actually bought a portable, I have just made portable units out of regular fishfinders. All I ever did was buy a suction cup (probably 1 aisle over) and a box to house/transport everything in. Saved some $$ doing it that way, rather than paying 50.00 more for a matching case."
292161,Court R,2009-01-14 13:34:00,213,The Hummingbird 565 portable is a great unit.
292303,goteeboy,2009-01-14 20:36:00,175,visit ebay. someone is always selling...and you'll come across the one that suits you eventually.
292424,Rich,2009-01-14 23:57:00,3927,You really can't go wrong nowadays with portable sonar units. The $100 versions of the Humminbirds or Eagles work just fine for ice fishing.
292574,Fang,2009-01-15 03:27:00,1330,BPS Vaughan is selling the Eagle 320 for $199 and with some McGivering you can easily rig it with 2-6V and make it portable. I really like the full screen LCD as I can look away for a bit and still have a brief record of fish on the graph. Been ice fishing with an old X55 for years now and it works fine.
292576,forrest,2009-01-15 03:31:00,1032,snorkel and mask $15.
292606,gone_fishin,2009-01-15 06:08:00,481," i'm sure that unit would be just fine, but it's not a portable... you could, like someone mentioned, Macgyver something up as a suitable power source... but this particular model is one that you would mount to a boat and wire up to the boat's battery... unless there is a portable model that just isn't listed there...  i've got a portable humminbird pirhanna, and while ice fishing it works fine... though, if it's a fairly cold day it doesn't read the transducer and just doesn't work at all (on the screen it will say ""transducer not connected"") and it won't read anything... also, if you're gonna go with a portable fish finder over a flasher (like a Vex or Marcum), here are a couple tips that will help you out... i'm sure the unit you pick up will be slightly different...  i've got mine set up as follows... and again, this is for MY unit... yours may be different... 1. turn off the fish ID 2. turn up the sensitivity as high as possible 3. leave the ""filter"" option ON (if your unit has one) otherwise you'll get all kinds of garbage on the screen that you don't want 4. turn the chart speed to it's maximum speed setting, that way it is as close to ""real"" time as possible.  good luck with your purchase! and if you have any more questions about fine tuning the settings, send me a pm, i'll try to help as much as possible."

292715,youngvedder,2009-01-15 18:30:00,72,I just got the humminbird 565 portable for christmas....reviews seem to outline it a good unit.  I will be heading up to bala this weekend to give it a try. will give you an update next week.  Yv
292829,Muskieman,2009-01-15 22:40:00,2472,A stick of CIL Dynamite is going for about 8.50$ / stick...one time use only.  Cuda 168 at ctc for 129.99... make it portable by adding a lawnmower battery or a cigarette lighter attachment.. that's what I use and haven't any problems yet.. takes a little MCGivering on your part though.  GOOD LUCK!!  RFS

292926,danbo,2009-01-16 01:20:00,2646,I recommend LeBarons for a Humminbird Piranha 220 sonar for $99. Then get the 12volt battery + charger for $37. A plastic Dry Box can be used to house it all.
