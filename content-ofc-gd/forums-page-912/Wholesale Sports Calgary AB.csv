Ordered an auger extension for my Jiffy power auger, a set of curved blades for my 8"" Fin-Bore III and the lazer deluxe sharpener on Jan 5th. Order was shipped on the 8th and received today.  Fair pricing, fair postage costs and best of all no PST !  www.wholesalesports.com   ....and yes I try to shop local ! BUT...Nobody had an extension.. nobody had curved blades. LOTS had Swedebore blades.. no Fin Bore."

292853,glen,2009-01-15 23:30:00,2641,"Hey Wayne how do you like the fin bore? Is it better then the swede bore?  I have a 6"" and an 8"" swede bore but i am thinking about getting a 8"" fin bore."
292883,irishfield,2009-01-16 00:11:00,26272,Auger works great when sharp.... and when my right arms mobility is cooperating for the offset handles. I have no experience with the swede bore to compare.
292894,glen,2009-01-16 00:36:00,2641,Ok i think i will try the fin bore.  Thanks.
292900,BassAsin,2009-01-16 00:43:00,806,i have one of each and can drill a hole much faster with sweede and if u are drilling a hole in an ice shack its hard with the fin bore your knuckles hit the wall way too much!
292901,irishfield,2009-01-16 00:45:00,26272, Well if you wanna try before you buy.... you know where I live!
