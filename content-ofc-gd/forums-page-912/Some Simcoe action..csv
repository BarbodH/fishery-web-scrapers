292801,Sinker,2009-01-15 21:58:00,8692,"Spent the last 2 days on simcoe chasing whities and trout.  Wed, met up with Buckster at JP, for a day out with Hanks  huts. Fishing was a little slow, but the afternoon brought me 2 decent lakers. Lost 2 other fish......not much luck for Buckster. I was happy with the lakers, I wasn't really expecting too much action.  Today, got to the acess and it was -29. No wind, and clear sky. We hitched up 2 portables, and headed out to no mans land, to aimlessly wander the open ice in search of our quarry. The auger fell off the sleigh about 1 mile from our intended destination, so we drilled a hole. Within 5 mins Ritchie had a fish on, 10 seconds later, Frank had one too.........we almost got a triple header, but I was a little slow getting the first one.......  The action never did stop all morning, and into the afternoon. We had a great mix of whities and lakers.  I was having cold issues with my camera for the morning. Just too cold to operate I guess.....but I got it working after putting the batteries in my inside pockets.  Once the sun was up, it was just a beauty day out there. Its not hard to keep warm in the dry cold, with no wind. Most of the time my mitts sat on the ice.    We left with a few whities for the table, and I got an entry for the tourney.  Heres our set up.  Eskimo quickflip, with a clam scout behind. Conditions were perfect for travelling by sled out there. Can't really get much better. Conditions over all, were great.    The ice has really been forming with this cold weather. I measured at least 12"" everywhere today, and one spot had 15"".......all clear black ice. You could see the fish thru it, it was that clear. By the weekend, there will be trucks going out there for sure.......careful of the cracks!    Great day, and a great start to my simcoe hardwater adventures    Sinker"
292808,johnnyb,2009-01-15 22:02:00,3413,NICE!  Very well done...can't wait to get back out there...gotta love those rare days of no wind.
292813,Clampet,2009-01-15 22:21:00,1947,"Wow, the ice has really built up. Nice fish. Mind, me asking how you prepare them fer the table?"
292835,Sinker,2009-01-15 22:49:00,8692,I cook them different every time. Filleted and fried........deep fried in batter.........baked.......smoked......bbq'd.......its a never ending list of fish dinners. Gotta love it  Sinker

292942,dsn,2009-01-16 01:40:00,1018,"Sinker, How deep were you fishing? Just wondering if Hanks is Out at 70 FOW yet.  Thanks  DSN"
292947,Beats,2009-01-16 01:46:00,543,Nice report.  I like how you decided to stop and fish at the first sign of something flying off your sled.  It appears to have worked out.  Any hints as to tackle used?
292949,mukluk,2009-01-16 01:52:00,196,Excellent report Sinker.  Nice fish. Thanks for the info on the ice thickness.
292955,solopaddler,2009-01-16 01:57:00,8605,"WTG bud! I was wondering how you guys were making out today. I just got in 15 mins ago myself, the kids had a blast, we caught a ton of perch!  Cheers"
292957,Zubris21,2009-01-16 01:59:00,563,some nice whities there!  I'd really like to get out one simcoe for some of those some day.
292979,Rizzo,2009-01-16 02:51:00,4754,"Great report, I give you guys credit for being out there in the weather we've had"
292986,trapshooter,2009-01-16 02:57:00,1234,Nice fish Sinker.  I guess the auger decided where the fish would be.  Hard to ignore advice like that.
292988,highdrifter,2009-01-16 03:04:00,2534,Very noice..  Ya got me totally pumped for the weekend!!  cheers mang HD
293008,buckster,2009-01-16 03:45:00,530,Hanks huts were in 68fow

293087,corvette1,2009-01-16 13:04:00,1765,congrats sinker nice haul on the lakers and whites
293107,Sinker,2009-01-16 14:07:00,8692,"  Thanks guys,  We got most of them on bad boys. Green/black with a 2"" tube in chartreuse. Fairly aggressive jig was the ticket. 72 FOW. The cold was totally bearable. I've been out on days when its just below zero that were much harder to keep warm. No wind and full sun is easy to keep warm!!!  Sinker"
293108,Leecher,2009-01-16 14:09:00,7832,Great report and pics Sinker  Got to love it when there's none stop action.... Good job you guys Thanks for sharing Leechman
293114,limeyangler,2009-01-16 14:26:00,5204,"Greatr stuff Sinker!  Love the bit about the auger deciding the honey hole....  Good lookin' whities as well.
