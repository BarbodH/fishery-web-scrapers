291881,CLofchik,2009-01-13 21:10:00,854,"I ride a motorcycle a bit, and carrying a longer rod really got to be quite a pain.  Tried a few of the usual sub-7' suspects but I really got used to having a longer rod.  9' MH 12-20lb rated 3pc spin rod would be ideal, but good luck trying to find the thing! Anybody seen anything close to that, any closet custom tyer's know of a suitable blank? Ideas?"
291883,MJL,2009-01-13 21:22:00,2427,"Albright tackle has an 8'3"" travel spinning rod for $100. http://www.albrighttackle.com/conventional-rods-spining.html  As for blanks, Lamiglas also has an 8'6"" travel blank that should fit your needs.  They also do the same blanks as finished rods as well. http://www.lamiglas.com/blank_indiv.php?groupid=55  Hope this helps"
291891,solopaddler,2009-01-13 21:43:00,8605,Pretty much any 9-12wt 4pc fly rod blank tied into a spinning rod would do the trick. (there's lots available)  If you've got a deep wallet the ultimate would be a 9' 10wt Sage Z Axis.
291892,forrest,2009-01-13 21:45:00,1032,"Shimano sells travel rods.  The longest is 13' 6"", it is a European model.  Maybe they have a longer one, but, I doubt it. They have 2 lines: Exage and Beastmaster.  BPS sells them, but, I do not know which versions."
291894,forrest,2009-01-13 21:46:00,1032,If Armpit of Ontario refers to Oshawa (I always thought it was a different body part).  Gagnon's sells them too.

292612,CLofchik,2009-01-15 08:21:00,854," Saltwater surf rods are a little too heavy & chunky to cast much with, they're meant more for bottom fishing out of a stand. But Albright is a new one, that looks like exactly what I'm looking for thanks!   I lean more towards faster action rods, chucking spoons or twitching jerkbaits for a few hours is a killer when you're fighting half the rod.  Plus I'd like to keep it under the cost of your net, seeing as how I'm going to be doing silly things like strapping to the back of a motorcycle"
292653,MJL,2009-01-15 15:05:00,2427," From what I was told by the customer service guy, it was more of a flats spinning rod for bigger fish like tarpon, permit, cudas, etc.  Definitely not a surf casting rod.  Albright has these to cover that: http://www.albrighttackle.com/conventional...rf-casting.html"
292696,kemper,2009-01-15 17:09:00,2232,"  I have an 8 wt fly rod that would be stiffer than most of my spinning rods, seems to me most (at least of the ones I have used) heavier fly rods have a very fast action to keep the tip from wobbling around for hours after your cast"
