How do you think she will do against the men? I think she has just as good a shot as any of the men. Maybe her lack of experience will be her downfall. Luck will play a part and thus she has a chance.  This years field has 51 entrants of which 13 are Classic Rookies  There are 7 former Classic champs in the field: Jones 2008, VanDam 2001, 2005, Iaconelli 2003, Davis 1995, Duckett 2007, Hite 1999, and Clunn, 1976, 1977, 1984, 1990  There are 9 former Toyota Tundra Bassmaster Anglers of the Year: VanDam 1992, 1996, 1999, 2008, Reese 2007, Iaconelli 2006, Davis 1995, 1998, 2001, Martens 2005, Horton 2000, Klein 1989, 1993, Hite 1997, 2002, and Clunn 1988  Casey Ashley is the youngest at 25  Rick Clunn will be oldest at 62  Clunn will break his own record for most Classics fished with 32 while another BASS great, Gary Klein, can break his own record of Classic futility if he fails to win in 2009. He already holds the record for most appearances without a win at 26  If he can win his 5th title, Clunn will eclipse Woo Daves' record as the oldest Classic champ. Daves was 54 years, 2 months and 28 days old when he won the 2000 title. Florida's Bernie Schultz could also break Daves' record with his first BASS win. He'll be three months older than Daves was when the next Classic ends  No one in the field can break Stanley Mitchell's record as youngest Classic champ. Mitchell was 21 years, 5 months and 19 days old when he won in 1981  Do any of you enter or run fishing pools?  FULL FIELD:  1.	Casey Ashley 2.	Kim Bain-Moore 3.	Ken Baumgardner 4.	Michael Burns 5.

292293,misfish,2009-01-14 20:10:00,29133,"  I,ll 2nd that one.  People talk about machine fishermen,this guys like the energy bunny. Just keeps going and going."
292422,jediangler,2009-01-14 23:55:00,1923,"Wouldn't surprise me a bit if a woman won the classic. I can't see any advantage to men over women for fishing tournaments. Kind of like poker   . If Danica Patrick can out drive the men, anything is possible."
