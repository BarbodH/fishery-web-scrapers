291634,Clampet,2009-01-13 04:00:00,1947,"Late Ice Fishing is the Best By Sam Anderson  As winter ice fishing progresses some tactics have to be changed.   Early in the season the action is fast and as the ice gets thicker and  the days colder the fish have a tendency to slow down and move.  In  fact, in most bodies of water mobility is crucial if you want to stay on  fish.  Structure is as much the key to success for the ice fisherman as it  is for the open water angler.  Structures take many different shapes,  but they share one thing in common, and that is they differ from the  surrounding bottom enough to be noticed by the fish.  The most common  and most recognizable piece of structure is the point of land that  extends from shore out into the water.  Points create a raised portion  of land beneath the water's surface, making it different from the  surrounding bottom.  These points extending from shore may be classified  also as bars or reefs.  Sunken islands and rock piles can also be ideal  fish holding areas, and areas where you want to concentrate your  efforts.  Pieces of structure found in a migration route created by  current from a nearby river that flows into a lake, can offer a choice  hunting ground for walleye seekers, in winter as well as summer.  Although many structures ( such as points) can be visually located  even in winter, others like sunken islands or underwater rock piles can  be difficult to find because of your limited mobility.  The need to  drill holes to fish greatly reduces the amount of area that the winter  angler can cover in a set amount of time.  This is where technology is  helping the ice angler out.  The use of a depth finder and a GPS unit is  essential for fishing on the ice.  I know that I spend a great deal of  time on the water in the summer time and when I find a piece of  structure that has all the elements of good ice fishing structure, I  will put it in my LCX-15-MT.  When late season walleye fishing gets  tough I will use a hand held GPS Lowrance iFinder unit and find that  specific piece of structure.  Some companies even have a hand held depth  finder that will shoot through the ice and eliminate the need for  drilling unnecessary holes.  Your lure selection might also have to change.  Right now on many  lakes the favorite is the Pounder and the Fat Boy (both made by System  Tackle, a Lindy-Little Joe Company), which have a flat profile that  reflects a sonar's signal easily.  They are also made a bit heavier so  you can stay in contact with the bottom. Attach a head of a redtail  chub, or a shiner and it will have a natural scent as well as added  flash.  This will simulate a wounded minnow and turn those inactive fish  into active ones.  One more type of lure that suspends the rate of fall is the Jigging  Rapala.  This type of jig has a swimming action and it darts as it  falls.  This will give the fish an impression that minnows are darting  and swimming towards them and escaping from them and it will trigger a  response from those finicky walleyes.  Another tip to remember is to be conscience of the size of your  bait.  The old adage that the ""larger the bait, the larger the fish,""  will hold true, but if the fish turn off, try a smaller size and you  might be surprised.  Line becomes an important variable in late season ice fishing.   Light line is good in early ice, but I prefer to switch to the heavier  line in late season, due primarily to abrasion on the ice hole.   Also  because northern pike frequent walleye hangouts and this added tensile  strength will give me an edge.  I usually use Berkley Trilene XT 8 lb  for these late winter excursions spooled onto a good spinning rod that  allows me adjustable drag, because one never knows what monster will  decide to take your lure.  Late season you will experience reduced prices on tackle and  lodging, uncrowded lakes, a slower pace and more personal services.  The  ice may be a little thicker but the walleyes are going to be to hot to  handle. If it does get to hot to handle, let me know by dropping me a  line at www.samanderson.com.  Hope to hear from you soon."

291718,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-13 14:41:00,0,"anywhere from 4 to 40 fow. Get a map. Picks some spots, shoals. flats, points and go fish! It may take you a couple tries but this way you can say you did it yourself!!!!"
291846,trapshooter,2009-01-13 19:48:00,1234,"Fish will be in different locations throughout the day (usually deeper mid day and shallower at the prime feeding times, morning and evening).   Andy was very right to suggest they can be found in the wide range of 4-40 feet.  They also make seasonal migrations over the course of the winter.  In General, at first ice they aren't far from where you'd fish in the fall.  They will still be relating to main lake structure, near a basin.   Find a nice point or shoal with deep water nearby and swiss cheese the ice with holes until you connect.  Mid winter they are still deep and this can be the most difficult time to catch finicky walleye.  As last ice approaches they migrate towards spawning areas.  Creek mouths, bays with gradually tapering rock rubble shorelines, areas where weeds growth will begin to occur etc.  They will stage on structure near where they spawn after the ice goes out.  On a shallow/weedy lake like scugog you can fish them in/around the weeds all winter long.  Bottom line is, you need a map and a willingness to move around and explore new spots and different structure.  A flasher or fish finder will shorten your learning curve by showing if there are fish present and just not biting on what you're offering.  Learn from what you see as well, if a certain point has huts or fishermen on it all the time, there's probably good reason for it."

292651,coreyL,2009-01-15 14:57:00,15,  it all depends where your fishing lakes/rivers etc the best way to figure it out is to play around with depths 14-30 feet  and stay till at least till 5 o clock cause thats when they bite!!
