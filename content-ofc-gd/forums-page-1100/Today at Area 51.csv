148418,Rich,2008-01-06 12:09:00,3927,Well ya did better than us. We got out only for about an hour and a half and got the big old skunk. Went and talked to a couple of guys who had a couple of jumbo perch and some bluegill. I guess at some point while we were talking to them I had a pretty good hit cuz one of my rods was down when I came back and bait was gone.  Too bad we missed you two but there will be more opportunities.

148487,sleded,2008-01-06 17:41:00,96,Me and the wife also got a skunk rich. We fished about 3 hrs without a hit but it was a good day to get out. We marked some fish over by the point but i guess we needed some tiny jigs and maggets.  Over all it was fun just to get out and give her a go lets hope we get some cold weather next week but doesint look like its going to happen. Nice meeting you again joonmoon and wife well have to meet down there again before the season ends.  sleded
