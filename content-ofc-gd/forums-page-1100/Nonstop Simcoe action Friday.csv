148190,Smokey,2008-01-05 16:11:00,1278,Ron and I tagged up yesterday for a day of perching. We had nonstop action from 8-3. The sonar was a blurr of action with fish in an all day feeding pattern. Fish were on the bite in depths from 19 to 36 ft. Rough guess for the day was over 200 fish caught and few kept for a meal for each of us at the end of the day. Fish were ranging from 6 inches to 11 inches with most being good solid fish.  Small bright green jigs tipped with scented tails was the hot bait for the day.  Going to be a dynamite weekend of fishing for those able to get out there.  Good Luck if you go.
