148336,Mike the Pike,2008-01-06 02:35:00,3421,"I planned a trip this week to a very small Lake in Alexandria Ontario in hopes of my son catching his first Pike.There was no early rising today we took our time because we know that Pike will bite any time of day.Temperature was plus one.  Think gas is high in Ontario look at this we are getting screwed in Quebec  Extra taxes to fill the billions of pot holes in our province.   I left Quebec at the early time of 9:09 dropped my daughter off in Delkeith and then my Son Ryan (who is 9)and I headed off to to Alexandria to renew my Ontario fishing licence.Stopped off at Canadian Tire they sell fishing licences right................WRONG   The clerk at CTC says to drive to the next town Green Valley about 10kms out of my way   .Arrived there payed for my new sportsman licence had a good chat with the owner of the store and Esso and we were back on our way.  Got to the lake packed up the sled and proceeded to the fishing grounds.  My little man working really hard while I pulled the ice hut and and more stuff. Man I am out of shape   It wasn't really cold but my son insisted that we put up the hut and he wanted the coleman heater ready incase his feet get cold. Well we were finally set up at 12:30pm and it was time to start fishing.     For those of you who don't know I have a big bright yellow survival suit and some OFNers have found some names for me so I thought I would bring the Yellow tweetie bird with us.   The waiting game had begun one hour and no fish.   Ryan went outside to stretch his legs and I said no Ryan you can't pee in front of my ice shelter find a far away place to PEE.   Finally my skunk was dead .I had not caught a fish since October 27th,2007. Ryan got to close with the camera um back up to snap the shot little buddy.   A little dink but hey I will take it better than the dreaded skunk.   Tried to release him down the hole where I had placed a tip up and he decided to do the banana. picked it back up and down the hole it went.   Pike number 2 showed up about 20 mins later .    Dink number 2 but I hope my boy gets the next one.   The wind picked up and you can always count on the Coleman heater to keep you warm. By now Ryan wants a Pike so badly he says Dad give me the swedish pimple on your line. So what do I do I give him the whole rod with the lucky swedish pimple and a juicy lively minnow.   The time finally came and Ryan's line goes for a scream and he comes flying off his seat yelling dad I got one and its huge Dad it finally gets up to the hole but is stuck horizontally you could here his excitement and it fianlly pops through the hole and we do the high five thing.  Outside for a picture and he tells me Dad you have to post my pike on OFC cause its my first pike of my life . So here it is OFNers the happy boy with a million dollar smile.  At 4pm I tell my son we will call it a day at 4:30.  At around 4:10 I get a hit that almost rips my rod right out of my hand but no hook up. This thing must of had sprinted at my line I tell ya got the heart pumping.  So at 4:24 pm I get the last dink of the day.     This Pike had an old battle scar he had like a double set of lips must of had his lip ripped open at one time.  Well the day had to end and Ryan said to take this picture for OFC to tell all he had a great day. He wants to go back because he likes the way pike fight.   Tweety had a good day also and had to say good night   Filled up my Gas tank at a more reasonable price and headed back to Quebec where I promissed my son a great big poutine at La Belle Province restaurant for catching his first pike.  What a priceless day my son enjoyed every moment.  Mike the Pike"
