148169,superdad,2008-01-05 14:22:00,353,"Was out to fish with Laker John, picked up a pile of Minnows from  DewDrop Inn and then picked up my stuff and off to the ramp.  At the ramp, there's  a chap who had to go to WORK (Ugh) and he told us that he and his buds picked up four walleyes in fifteen minutes and some huge perch too.  We headed out and went to our 'spot' and dug our holes, started fishing at 0925.  Shortly thereafter, I had a hit and landed a 12"" perch, then fifteen mins later another 'jumbo'.  Rather than itemize the entire fishing day, here's the summary.  3 walleyes, 12""-13""(released) and 16""(kept for the table)  6 Perch, two jumbos and four around 8"" - all table fare.  At the beginning there were approx 17 fishers on the ice, and the as the afternoon got later, the fishers came flooding down the launch ramp and when we left at 1700, there were approx 65 fishers all strewn over the ice.  We got our fish on Little Cleos, Green and Florescent tipped with at least two muds.  There was approx 8 inches of ice, where we were. We talked to some people who advised us that ice further east up Hay Bay only had perhaps 4 inches in some parts.  With the weather - Remember Play Safe......"
148185,Smokey,2008-01-05 15:57:00,1278,Thanks for the report David. I've got some time off in the next few weeks and was hoping to get down there fishing so I'm hoping the upcoming warm weather doesn't mess things up.  Keep the reports coming.
