148275,Jen,2008-01-05 21:29:00,833,Opps sorry posted in Fishmaster name ....Jen Today has been a blast on the water... from chainsawing holes in the ice to playing with my nefew.  With the warm weather fast approaching Sonny came out to get in a little ice fishing.  He brought his son Domenic...  They had a blast catching crappies in the pond  while Steve was out sinking Christmas trees to create a little more structure in the Marina.        This afternoon will be my last goose hunt and then midnight ice fishing... hopefully I will have fish pictures to post soon.  Cheers and happy new year everyone! Jen
148278,CRAPPIE,2008-01-05 21:57:00,213,Midnight fishing? Are you going to fish in Fishmaster marina tonight. I 've been there two times but got nothing!  Thanks!

148308,bassmaster4,2008-01-05 23:12:00,801,is that place still going to be open or will there be a fee?
148337,Jen,2008-01-06 02:36:00,833,"There is fishing here 24/7 - Guys have been doing good with catching Crappie whatever time of day it is and the moon lights the ice really beautifully at night.  Today there were some perch caught as well as crappie and bluegill.  Even a couple of large mouth.  The FISHTV things are awesome to see what is coming in and out of the marina as well.  There were kids ice skateing on the pond while their dads fished not 100 ft from them.  Kinda awesome if you ask me.  Domenic is my nefew and definately a cutie to say the least.  He is becoming a great little fisherman.  In regards to fees at the Marina, if you buy something at the store parking is free, if not parking is 5.00 for the day.   In the summer months there will be a 5.00 parking fee with a free boat launch.  Steve is always around if you need information or a hand.  Cheers, Jen"
