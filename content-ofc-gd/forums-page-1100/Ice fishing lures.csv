The lake of choice will be Simcoe and I will most likely try Scugog and BOQ this year too.  Target species will be Perch, Pike and pickeral.  All expertise is greatly appreicated!"
148287,FishFinder,2008-01-05 22:18:00,481,"dont waste your money on lures, save it for minnows."
148293,HUKDONFAWNIX,2008-01-05 22:25:00,135,Should I at least buy some glow in the dark jig heads?
148300,mistyriver1,2008-01-05 22:43:00,600,Grab yourself a few Rapala jigging raps.  A swedish pimple (which you can tip with minnows) are also pretty good.  Good luck.
148303,mistyjr1,2008-01-05 22:50:00,97,"Here's what I prefer over minnows:  Small Rapala Jigging Raps get the skinny ones not the fat ones, Bright coloured jigs heads (no larger than 1/4oz), Little spoons, I've heard Rattlin' Rapalas are good as well, If you are going to use minnows get spreaders.  Now all you need are the fish."

On most occasions, in my experiences; the walleye tend not to be very agressive. In saying that they will inhale your minnow with out even feeling it or you may feel a slight tap. So, in the event that they steal one of your minnows, you can keep the lure down there in the strike zone in an attempt to get him to strike again."
