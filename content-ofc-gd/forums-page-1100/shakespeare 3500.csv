148366,bassmaster4,2008-01-06 03:43:00,801,So i bought that Ugly Stik rod and reel combo i was talking about earlier in the week and the reel it came with was a shakespeare 3500. Is the reel any good? Does anyone have any past experience with it they would like to share either positive or negative?  Thanks for any info.   Bassmaster4

148399,bassmaster4,2008-01-06 05:20:00,801,"thanks for that i was gonna replace it before soft water season if it was crap because my last rod and reel combo, the reel was a disapointment"
148405,drwxr,2008-01-06 09:23:00,453,"i looked today at the combo in ct, rod is ok, reel i would change it. but since you need to change the reel, why not return the combo back and get the  ugly stik lite combo. its 10-15 dollars more expensive, in my opinion better rod, and comes with decent 4 ball bearing reel that i used for salmon this fall, and it worked fine."
148557,bassmaster4,2008-01-06 21:52:00,801,ill stick with this one i liek the feel of the rod and ill just get a different reel when this one screws up
148565,drwxr,2008-01-06 22:32:00,453,"its up to you, still i suggest you go and check out the ugly stik lite combo, you gonna end up spending same amount of money, so why not get the better combo. by the way there is a promotion now, not sure if its with all ugly stiks, but with the lite you also get a free tackle soft bag. as bonus. http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0042213121573a.shtml"
