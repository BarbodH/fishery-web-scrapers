147818,Dondorfish,2008-01-04 02:14:00,1000,Check the regs. - thought I read somewhere that if a portable hut is over so many square feet - you need to register it - new for 2008.    Don
147822,fishindevil,2008-01-04 02:17:00,6254,"I thought that if it is left in a position for more than 24hrs,that its considered a permanent hut?????...im not 100% sure but thats what i was lead to believe..."
147825,lovetofish,2008-01-04 02:21:00,500,"won't be leaving it for more then 24 hours, no worries there."
147826,Terry,2008-01-04 02:22:00,14456,"· You do not need to register an ice hut if it is a tent made of cloth or synthetic fabric that has a base area of two square metres (21.5 square feet) or less when erected. · Ice hut registration numbers must be at least 6.3 cm (2.5 in.) in height and clearly displayed on the outside of the hut. · Whether or not an ice hut removal date applies to your Zone, it is an offence under the Public Lands Act to leave your ice hut out after ice break up.  so if it has would on it you do.."
147834,Dondorfish,2008-01-04 02:29:00,1000,Hey Terry - so what about these 6x8 ( and larger ) tent type huts you see out there?    Don
147835,fishindevil,2008-01-04 02:33:00,6254,"Good info terry,thanks i was going to look it up....so thanks !!!!   cheers"
147840,Terry,2008-01-04 02:44:00,14456,"well according to the regs, I would say they need to be registered but how the COs handle it God only knows"
147852,danbo,2008-01-04 03:07:00,2646,The whole registry is; that the numbers displayed give the MNR somebody to fine(for littering) if they abandon the huts beyond March 15. Hazardous to spring boaters too. (Some guys used to burn 'em down if too deeply frozen-in!)

148057,DT10Sam,2008-01-05 00:47:00,480,"You will definitely have to read the regs. the CO's in this area claim that they have to be registered now for 2008.  Regards, Sam"
