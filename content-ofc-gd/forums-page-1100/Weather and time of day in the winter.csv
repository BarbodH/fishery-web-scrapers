148311,HUKDONFAWNIX,2008-01-05 23:18:00,135,Possible dumb questions........but I gotta ask 'em.  Does the weather effect ice fishing?  Are the peak times (Dawn & Dusk) in the soft water season applicable in the winter?  Thanks!
148312,gone_fishin,2008-01-05 23:22:00,481,"for the most part, dawn dusk generally are the best times... barometric pressure, i think, has the biggest effect on fishing, both in summer and winter."
148331,Greencoachdog,2008-01-06 02:00:00,8163,"Dusk, night, and dawn for the low light feeders like wall-ice, Crappie and Burbot. Daylight hours for Perch, Pike, Whitefish, and Lakers.  Time of day is less important with the more snow cover there is.  Barometric pressure is still a factor."
148364,fishindevil,2008-01-06 03:40:00,6254,"Yes what glen said !!!!...yes the ice does affect the level of sunlight that gets through,clear ice with no snow cover will let more light in too,so species that like to feed in low light conditions,can now under the ice have that period last much longer as with the snow cover it can be quite dark all day long,giving fish like walleyes hours & hours to feed when ever they want to,...so sometimes you have to try fishing at different times of the morning,noon and before dusk,and when its overcast it makes it even darker still,we have had days where we were on the ice at 5 am,all ready,lines down the holes.and nothing till around 10am when the bright morning sky turned cloudy,and got very overcast & dark,well thats when they turned on,and im talking about both lake trout & walleyes,so try different times and areas,at different light conditions....cheers"
