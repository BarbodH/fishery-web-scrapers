148019,Hookset,2008-01-04 21:59:00,367,"Lake Muskoka froze all the way only yesterday. South east end anyway. When I went to work in the morning it was still open, and by early afternoon she was froze. From my work I can see across a stretch probably for almost 2 miles. So at the max. there is probably an inch. Small bays may be different but I wouldn't go out there yet.  Rosseau won't be any different.  Definitely not good ice yet...   Hookset."
