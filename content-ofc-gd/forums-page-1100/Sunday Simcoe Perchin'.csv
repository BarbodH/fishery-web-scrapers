148541,Skud,2008-01-06 20:52:00,739,Went out again this morning with my Bro-in-law out from Gilford. Walked a bit further out but also south bound.  Tried three spots that were 17-20 fow with a weedy bottom. The action was good from 7:30am untill 11:30am. We left at noon with about 45 keepers between us out of over 120 caught. Lots of water on the surface as we left due to warm temps. It probably will be 2 weeks untill we can hit safe ice again.
148554,Terry,2008-01-06 21:46:00,14456,wow sounds like the perch fishing was pretty good
148564,fishboy,2008-01-06 22:18:00,550,"sounds like fun...do you really think this will set the ice back 2 weeks?  I can't see how a few days of warm weather (with some below 0 nights) is going to cause enough damage to 7"" of ice on Cook's"
148626,Joey,2008-01-07 01:54:00,9122,"Wow, that is really non stop action eh Doug.  Great to hear.  Joey"
148640,Fang,2008-01-07 02:29:00,1330,I agree with skud  With temps as high as they are predicting next week and rain there will be lots of water on the ice. If the winds push that water around it will melt down the ice very quickly. Ice could get very spongy and soft. Day by day thing and hope for the best!
