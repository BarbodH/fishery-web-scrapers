He came by for a look at the bird feeder and was immediately swarmed by half a dozen Crows. They were squawkin up a storm and ran him right out of the neighbor hood. As I watched the onslaught of attacks he defended himself well and dam near grabbed a crow in mid flight. Seen more birds of prey in the last couple of years in the city forests and neighborhood bushes. Gotta luv it. Too bad for the pidgeon...lol. Survival of the fittest.

In the summer I often take a break near one particularly good hill, and watch the soaring hawks do their thing. It is just incredible how fast they can swoop on an unsuspecting bird and nab one of out a flock as well. I am very encouraged at how well the hawk population is rebounding. It was not all that long ago they were looking at extinction due the DDT residue turning their eggs shells so soft they wouldn't hatch. As a top predator it is good to see them flourishing as that shows the whole ecosystem is doing better. Almost weekly now I see hawks that are HUGE and healthy and to me that is a good sign. Recently some scientists were doing a radio show wondering where all the native small birds were since apparently their numbers are down now. All you have to do is see the number of hawks around here and it isn't too hard to figure out.... The other birds had a really good run for 15 yrs or so while the raptor population rebuilt itself, now it will be interesting to see how it all levels out."
