It is a smaller lake called  lake NOYFB.  We have fished it for the past few winters.  Last winter I topped out with a Whittie at 9lbs 8oz. Anyways we arrived at 7:30am and decided to wait for day light as this was our first trip this winter to the lake.  The ice was aout 14"" 100 feet from shore with almost no snow cover.  About 200 feet out I noticed some different looking pressure crakes in the ice, I thought that i better put a test hole in to make sure, the ice was less then 3"" thick and we had to beat a quick retreat.  Oh well, we headed up to Ahmic lake , about an hour North and headed out.  Saw two groups of people, and hout we went.  The ice was great, about 10"" black ice all the way across with 2 to 3 inches of white ice on top and very little snow.   We fished from 40 FOW up to 20 FOW with no luck.  We didn't mark a fish all day. The guys fishing a little shallower were catching some dinks but that was it. All and all it was great to get out.  I am glad not to have fallen through at my favourite lake.  Next weekend I will be heading up to Burk Falls to do a little back woods spec fishing, as i do not think the warm weather will ruin the 14"" + ice on my smaller lakes.  Great to see all the sucess people had this weekend."
