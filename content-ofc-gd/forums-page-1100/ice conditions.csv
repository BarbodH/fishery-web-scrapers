147799,Riparian,2008-01-04 01:03:00,269,Are you refering to Lake Simcoe? If you are I wouldn't expect to be fishing lake trout or whitefish grounds with safe ice under me for a few weeks yet.
147806,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-04 01:39:00,2585,my boss lives on kempenfelt bay in barrie and he said there was open water all holiday long.  its going to get worse with the warm temps coming.  you may have to go north to a smaller lake to get good safe ice.  Cheers!
