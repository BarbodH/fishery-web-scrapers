148132,Rich,2008-01-05 12:05:00,3927,People who quit smoking are worse than born again Christians on the preaching front.
148138,Greencoachdog,2008-01-05 12:28:00,8163, You got that feces right!
148151,danbo,2008-01-05 13:29:00,2646,You in denial?
148156,Corey,2008-01-05 13:49:00,355,"There was nothing in the title of this thread that indicated it was non fishing or that it was smoking related. You tell me to grow up danbo, but you are posting this trying to be one of my parents telling me a choice I am making in life is bad... I am an adult, I will make my own choices, I don't need someone telling me what is bad or not bad for me.  As for this is the season for non fishing related posts... sure it is... but it might actually offend me that people think because they quit smoking they can try to shame or scare me into quitting. There's no need to post things like that. The majority of us are adults and I guarantee that not a single smoker who looks at that will say ""OMG what the heck I Quit!""... not a single person will, I know it, you know it, he knows it, so why post it?  What's next danbo? ban guns because it's guns that kill people and not people that kill people right?"

148172,JerseyDog,2008-01-05 14:33:00,190,"Funny - I knew it was an anti-smoking post before I opened it. This time of year its a timely topic as people try to start the year off smoke free so belongs on this fishing board since smoking, drinking and fishing are a very popular pastime.  I smoke but I hate smoking. It's not a choice (for me) its an addiction with its great pleasures and terrible side-effects.  And I am under no illusion that its health effects are nothing but devastating. I don't care about the drain on health care, pollution or anything else. I care that it makes me unhealthy and may very well kill me. So I struggle to quit. Sometimes I win for a while and then sometimes I lose.  I'm even worse than a non-reformed smoker - I smoke and still hate it and will happily tell anyone.  And read Allen Carr or Joel Spitzer and you might find out that smoking is less of a ""choice"" than you think.  Still, there is nothing finer than sitting at the end of the dock, drinking a beer, smoking a smoke and tossng a line in the water - which is part of the problem."
148052,Corey,2008-01-05 00:18:00,355,"Of course we all get along... my 2 points here are a. Is a fishing related website really the place to preach non-smoking by use of shocking pictures of a very rare extreme result of smoking? b. Tobacco and alcohol in Ontario are taxed like no other product. When we are paying $70-80 for a carton of cigarettes that the natives sell for $8, tell me that we aren't already paying more tax's.  What I dislike more than anything though, are people who used to smoke, who portray the attitude that they are better than people who smoke because they were able to quit. I smoke and I don't want to quit. There is nothing that makes an ex-smoker better than me. I do what I choose, I am educated to the possible downfalls of what I choose to do, now flip off and let me live my life. I don't need someone who feels they have bettered themselves by quitting trying to shame/guilt/scare me into quitting.  Like I said... if I want to see that stuff, or hear about that stuff I will google it."
148063,irishfield,2008-01-05 01:13:00,26272,Now about that friday night beer in your hand Corey.....
148072,Corey,2008-01-05 01:54:00,355, Of course... I still have a whole box of Labatt Bleu that hasn't been opened since Quinte... because I drink so much.

148099,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-05 04:02:00,2585,corey i understand your frustration with non smokers giving you a hard time.  its your choice not anyone elses.  used to drive me crazy too.  however you being upset about this being a fishing board and the post not related to fishing.  this time of year majority of posts are non fishing and danbo clearly stated warning graphic pics and smoking related.  if you dont want to read the non fishing related treads then dont read them.  i personally have learned alot of things from peoples topics on this board that had nothng to do with fishing at all. and many memebrs here enjoy the nf posts because they find it entertaining.  Hope you have a great weekend!  and just think in about 4 months soft water season will be here and all the nf posts will be put to bed for the fishing reports until this time next year lol where im sure we will do this non fishing vs fishing related topics all over again.  Cheers!
