Do you think if I bring in the receipt that they will give me the difference in price? I know there are certain clothing outlets that will do that but I am not sure about CTC. It would be roughly $30.00 difference. Thanks in advance.   G"
148159,speck5,2008-01-05 13:53:00,8,I am in the exact same boat as you. I paid $80 + for mine and now they are on sale for $49. Gonna see what I can do today about it.
148160,Bly,2008-01-05 13:56:00,1556,If an item goes on sale within two weeks of purchase you can take your receipt in and they will credit you the difference.  Happy ice fishing!
148161,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-05 13:56:00,1362,They'll definately give you back the difference!!...I've done it many times in the past!!

They said ""absolutely Sir"", and without even a question, they returned $50 + tax  Ya gotta luv that !!"
