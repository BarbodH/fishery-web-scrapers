148005,icewalker28,2008-01-04 21:29:00,39,"Took my dad and two friens up to Simcoe today. fish were very sluggish and not very plentyful. we managed about 25 keepers. Most fish were 10-12"" and hardly any small ones. I also beat my 15"" PB perch today , with a 15 1/2"" beauty!!! Let her go to make lots of babies. 12fow and deadsticking again. Marmooska jigs and minnow heads to downsize was what needed to be done to get some fish. Not very active at all. Good luck to everyone this weekend! Cheers. IW The new PB......... "
