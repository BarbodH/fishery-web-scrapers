147967,Bassloadingzone,2008-01-04 17:51:00,32,"  TJ very well said on your post   DANBO I sure hope if anything ever happens to a family member of yours, you never have to have some smart mouth punk write the comment that someone got stuck with cleaning up your loved ones, give your head a shake man, and I dont care what excuse you have for making such a Bull comment, cus there is no excuse for your comment.  If friends or family of these men read these comments I would like to say sorry that guys like Danbo are even aloud to post such idiotic comments  My prayers and deepest sympathy goes out to the families and friends of these men"
147969,daisy_girl58,2008-01-04 18:11:00,116,"Condolences to the families and friends  This a hypothetical question, but what is the chance that they could ban ice fishing or put so many restrictions that it would take the fun out of it. Plus all I kept hearing was how responsible or how much experience these guys were, ask there families that now.....How sad, I really feel sad for their families....Plus I am curious, do they have wear a seat belt on those snowmobiles? This is an idea, maybe have classes every time you need to renew or get your license just like the video that was posted! Make people do what that guy did, i bet it would cut down on the deaths! One time I got called on the carpet for the way i raised my kids, instead of harping ""don't do"" I would take them to places like drug and alcohol treatment centers and the big city where there was homeless. Alot of parents scolded me for it, but my kids have never tried that stuff or had a desire.  Lorissa"

I hope we can something from these terrible trajedies, and learn from them! not just snowmobiling but also running a boat without a lifejacket on or no seatbelts in a car etc... I guess we do the same things over and over, and never think that it could turn out bad!"
147972,bucktail,2008-01-04 18:12:00,1857,So sad. At least we havnt had the usual 2-8 people go through Lake Scugog this year as normally happens. I hope I havnt jinxed it now.
148034,Cast-Away,2008-01-04 23:14:00,790,"It's funny that TJ mentioned the government making things ""mandatory"" and over regulating our lives, because I was thinking that very thing the other day. The government was considering making snow tires mandatory in the winter time like they do in Quebec and one other province.  Where do they get off making these decisions for us? I personally buy good quality all season Michelin tires and never let them wear down to far before replacing them. I don't want the expense and storage issue of having two sets of tires for each vehicle that I own.  What next?"
148040,irishfield,2008-01-04 23:29:00,26272,"I reached the full ""peak"" when they made wearing seatbelts mandatory. We are becoming a communist country right before our eyes."
