In recognition and sincere appreciation of the power generated in the wake of ice storm ""98"" Mom and Ralph""  Hadn't been able to get ahold of her for a few days... so drove down one night at 3am..arriving at day break with my Generator and 50 gallons of AV gas in the back of the truck... after talking my way thru a couple road blocks. They were just getting ready to empty their full size chest freezer and bury the contents out in the snow. Hooked the Genny into their panel and it ran their furnace, freezer, fridge and water pump. Luckily they have a propane cooking stove and a wood stove...so they'd shut the genny down at night and stoke the stove. Fuel lasted just long enough...with them on the end of a dead end farm road and one of the last to get service restored."
