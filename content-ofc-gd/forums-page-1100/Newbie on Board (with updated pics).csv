I live on the Ottawa River just North West of Ottawa...I target almost all species of fish, but my main species are Muskie and Trout...I caught 2 PB's in 2007 that I would like to share with you all..the first pic is a 54""x24"" Muskie I caught last fall..the 2nd is a trophy Brookie caught last April  Thanks to Greencoachdog for helping me with resizing the pics!!!  FISH-ON!!     "
148144,Roy,2008-01-05 13:07:00,13728,Welcome aboard and great fish indeed! Looking forward to your posts.  ps. Would you be kind enough to send me a hi-rez copy of the brookie?
