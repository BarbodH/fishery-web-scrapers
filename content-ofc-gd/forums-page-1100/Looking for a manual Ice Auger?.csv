148036,Roy,2008-01-04 23:17:00,13728,"The first Canadian Tire store I ever went to was at Yonge and Davenport. It wasn't that big a store by today's standards but it was different. All the goods were strapped or blister packed to display counters. Beside each item was a stack of punched cards for that item. Once you selected what you wanted, you simply brought your cards off to the guy at the main desk and he'd hand them off to a bunch of kids on roller skates. They whip down the alleys of the backstore picking up your purchases and drop them off at the main desk where you were. 'Twas a quaint custom....I don't think they had ice augers then. But, they did have some very nice Supercycle bikes."
148045,irishfield,2008-01-04 23:40:00,26272,Just like going to the liquor store in the day !  'cept there were no rollerskates !
148049,lew,2008-01-05 00:06:00,12767,"Yup Roy, I remember all that stuff very well, and also the conveyor belt that brought the bigger items up into the center of the store from the basement.  And what kid from back in the day wasn't proud of his Supercycle"
148056,Beans,2008-01-05 00:44:00,3339,And what kid didn't wish they could get a job there...and get paid to roller skate all day...Better than paying at Mutual Arena...
148083,slidehammer,2008-01-05 02:56:00,28,"Back in the day we used skate boards and could smoke cigarretts. Had to quit doing both, but what a great place it was to work as a summer job. Picked up a nice 6 inch auger this evening.  Great price."
148086,Rattletrap2,2008-01-05 03:30:00,1652,"I still have my first ""Supercycle""! LOL I believe it is now 35 years old. Blue 10 speed. Out in the back shed, but I still got her!"
