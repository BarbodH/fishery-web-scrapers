148365,muskysean,2008-01-06 03:42:00,9,Hey everyone. Just a heads up for anyone who may be going through Tweed. I live here and for the past few weeks the price of gas has been considerably lower than everywhere else in the area. I went into town today and as of noon today (Saturday) the price of fuel was 83.9 at the Petro Can for self serve and 85.9 at the Olco for full serve. That's 25 cents a litre cheaper than in Belleville. Can't promise it will be the same tomorrow but if your coming up this way and need fuel it may be worth the risk to wait til you get here. If it is the same price then be prepared to have to wait in line. Both stations were like a bee hive today!
