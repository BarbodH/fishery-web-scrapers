213038,Wendel,2008-06-09 14:59:00,213,"Love the report, looks like you had a great time. Shame about the uncompleted project."
213040,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 15:10:00,7971,"Wow!!  Another incredible report.  I can relate to the whole ""I need a snack"" thing too....that's what we hear a lot when we have the little one with us.  Everything from the hitting those mines to seeing the abondoned camp, to seeing your new PB....kept me riveted.  I saw you posted a while ago, but I find I have to find a good chunk of time to read your reports...don't want to skim over these.  I still say you should write a book about your adventures....."
213139,solopaddler,2008-06-09 18:35:00,8605,"Great 2 part report Drew. I never get tired of seeing the images you post, fantastic once again!"

213166,wuchikubo,2008-06-09 19:37:00,1114,Truly another great report!    Maybe if we all pitched in we could make it an OFC clubhouse?!

213251,Moosebunk,2008-06-09 21:59:00,3970," Your's man... although a Scottish fella on another site wants it as well.  My little one's point of view didn't actually come from her.  It was my point of view of her point of view.  But I know her pretty well, she's 50% blood, 99% Bunk in nature.  Thanks again all."

212500,oldphart,2008-06-08 11:49:00,665,"~~( Jason Bourne I'd be having a weee bit of an identity crisis at this point. If I was a Charlie's Angel I'd either be PMS'ing or having a full on beeyotch fight with another Angel, or both.  I tried to think what Bond would do at a critical time like this...) ~~~~Never mind what Jason Bourne, Charlies Angels, or even Bond, James Bond, would have done, I'm more like Matt Kelm(Dean Martin), I would have poured myself a drink sung a soft song, and a bevy of woman would shown up to cap the adventure"
212515,limeyangler,2008-06-08 13:09:00,5204,"awesome report, real shame about that log cabin place."
212518,mattyk,2008-06-08 13:39:00,2110,"another amazing report, that keeps me daydreaming about the beautiful north. Thanks."
212521,douG,2008-06-08 13:49:00,2693,"Thanks very much, Drew.  Fabulous."
212530,Rybren,2008-06-08 14:05:00,28,"As always, a great, motivating report.  Reminds me of my times up north and makes me yearn to go back.  Back in my (much) younger days as a bush pilot, I came across an abandoned, fully finished 2-story log lodge north of Armstrong, Ontario.  It had a fully equipped kitchen, bar, and lounge, and had enough out cabins to sleep about 30 people.  There was row upon row of 14' boats with 20 horse Mercs and docks galore.  The place was absolutely spectacular and had never seen a single guest.  As the story goes, much like the place that you found, the local band got funding from the Feds to build the place and then couldn't be bothered to do anything with it.  What a shame!  Anyway, keep up the great posts.  I'm living vicariously through you.  Cheers,  Rybren."
212537,b2kptbo,2008-06-08 14:18:00,1505,"Real nice, thanks..."
212560,John,2008-06-08 15:12:00,2956,Thanks as always Drew. Amazing report.......
212570,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-08 15:30:00,0,Very Impressive pike!!! Did you weigh it???
212577,danc,2008-06-08 15:40:00,4677,Another beauty report Drew. I loved the girls aspect of the trip. That was priceless. The pb Pike is awesome. The orange fins look great. I'd love to included in one of your reports some day.  Thanks for sharing.
212610,scuro,2008-06-08 16:33:00,386,"I too enjoyed the girls report. Nice to see their faces again, I want to see the eldest bending the rod with a good fish again! Drew that's a NICE pike   It must be great to catch one of those in your back yard!"
212643,Moosebunk,2008-06-08 17:53:00,3970," That'll be the day I get writers block Dan and it'll end up just a big disappointment.  Nah, I can't wait to see your neck of the woods.  Since my other summer plans for brookies fell through and I didn't get very many chances this spring, the time there will be even more needed.   Quote JohnnyB ""Very Impressive pike!!! Did you weigh it???""  Nah!!  I'll guess 21 inches and about 6 pounds.  I'm only 2' 6"" myself.   Thanks again for the replies everyone.  Always happy you enjoy the reports... makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside."
