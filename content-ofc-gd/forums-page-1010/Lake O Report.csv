Was pulling the lines in when this one took a shot at the Spin Doctor.    Fishing in 125 - 200 feet of water with Spin Doctors/Spoons down 35, 45, 55 and 65. Rainbow hit a spoon at 35, the two Chinooks hit Spin Doctors at the deeper depths. Nice day to be out in spite of the slow action."
218119,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-22 21:43:00,0,Yes definitely a great day to be out of the water. That is until the lightning came. Thats a nice salmon. 4 salmanoids is a slow day??
218140,bbog,2008-06-22 22:06:00,665,Hey Clamp-it - we were out a couple miles and visibility towards shore was extremely limited. Upon coming in we did notice a few sailboats but not many really.  Hey Johnny Bass - we actually only had three fish from 8AM to 2PM and yes that is a slow day but not completely unexpected.  Anyone want to hazard a guess as to length and weight? I didn't record it.
