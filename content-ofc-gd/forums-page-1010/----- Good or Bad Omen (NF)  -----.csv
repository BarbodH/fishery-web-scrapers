217865,camillj,2008-06-21 18:16:00,1988,We see alot of them come through Muskokas in the fall ... not sure where they spend their summers though
217897,Sinker,2008-06-21 20:28:00,8692,"I have a feeling you guys are talking about common goldeneyes. Much more common than a barrows in Ontario. A borrow's would be a very uncommon bird this far inland from either coast......but its not impossible. Your discription of diving the shot, sounds like something a common GW would do.......crafty little buggers!!  Sinker"
