217759,duber,2008-06-21 02:56:00,220,I saw that.  Anyone here used it?  I thought about getting some but I'm a chicken when it comes to trying new stuff in a motor I can't afford to replace.

217796,bucktail,2008-06-21 12:27:00,1857,"I will be trying this year, as I had to get all 3 carbs done due to high ethanol this spring. My mechanic says the best way to avoid ethanol damage in the off season is to run the engine dry by picnching the hose. ASpparently alot of boats running into this. I even used Stabil in it last fall but he says it doesnt matter, maybe the new formula addresses it. Thats and I am only going to run super in it from now on. Hope this helps."
