217461,Master of Bait,2008-06-20 02:21:00,196,"Hey guys,  Just a follow up to my last report (5 mins ago).  Got some carpin' pics developed on the same roll but I thought I'd post a separate report.  Living in T.O. and having a busy schedule has led me to finally start targetting some of the beasts I've seen cruising around Lake O.  It's just ideal for me as I can usually only get out for a couple hours and the odds of tangling with a bruiser are quite high.  Nice way to sneak out for a quick fish.  Anyway, I got sick of watching these things jump and splash all over and not ever even having a shot at a tussle as I'm always chucking cranks or jigs....  Enter Mr. Goudas sweet corn.  I've got no real carp gear and I always thought a Boilie was a growth on your foot or something.  Not being a connoisseur, I decided to keep it simple with a heavy sliding sinker, swivel, mono leader, hook and corn rig - very basic.  Below is a collection of pics from three separate outings.  First carping trip.  Only fished for about an hour as I head to rush back home but I did manage to land a lake O 15 lb-er.   Second carping trip.  I was able to dedicate a few hours this time and they were ON!  Only problem was I went 2/7.  Had three break offs over rocks and two spit the hook as I was probably horsing them a bit too much.  I was also fishing solo from an anchored boat, which complicated things a bit.  Two in the boat though on a beautiful day:  First one was a 17 lb-er:   Self photo:   Bottom of the boat shot:   Next fish was 19 lbs.  Not a great shot but, hey, I'm on my own here...   Okay, now for the third carping trip.  My buddy and I went out and went one for three.  Lost two that spat the hook.  But the one I landed was HUGE!!!!!  I couldn't get it completely off the ground as I lifted it inside my net with the scale hooked to my net so as not to harm the fish.  The scale was at 32.5 lbs with the carp still touching the floor just a little and the scale just exploded!  It was an old non-digital one so who knows how accurate it was.  Suffice it to say it was a biggun'.  My buddy and I figured anywhere between 30-35 lbs is probably accurate enough.  Here are two shots for you:     Now I know why you carp guys are so into this stuff.   Cheers,  MOB"
217464,workwear,2008-06-20 02:32:00,592,well done....they can be a blast   great pics!!!
217465,shane,2008-06-20 02:37:00,652,Wow! that's a big carp. WTG!  It seems to have a weird shaped mouth.  Like it has no lips or something?
217467,purekgw,2008-06-20 02:38:00,585,nice man i cought a 30lb 1 in the river they put a really good fight 
217469,kentooley,2008-06-20 02:40:00,208,WTG...That last one is a hawg!!!
217476,Master of Bait,2008-06-20 03:20:00,196," Hey Fireball, yeah, the pic is lowsy.  I think the fish has his mouth closed or something.  I guess with the dark, disposable cam and a rush to get him back in the pic didn't turn out as I would have liked - never fails when it's a monster like that."
217482,sharper,2008-06-20 03:41:00,279,Wow great job! Fishing for carp off a boat too!
217490,FishKing,2008-06-20 06:10:00,5,"holy hell, that 30lbs is huge!"
217501,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-20 10:54:00,0,I think thats the first carping report off a boat! Well done! And that last one is a monster!!!!! Carp are great fighters and can provide steady action when they are active!
217502,Victor,2008-06-20 11:08:00,1609,"WTG MoB! That last one is a biggun! Very clean healthy looking fish. If you don't have too much time taking the boat out, there are many shore fishing opportunities for carp in and around the downtown area.  Try using a hair rig and your hookup % should go up. Thanks for sharing with us!"
217522,splashhopper,2008-06-20 12:29:00,2931,"welcome to carpin.. i don't why i didn't bother going for those bruisers before ??  theyfight like a bow without the aerial acrobatics and are just as tricky to catch,,, but hang on once u hook em.  keep on carpin  eh"

217595,ehg,2008-06-20 15:46:00,2666,"Thats the biggest freakin carp i've seen posted here! Thanks for taking the time to post. ehg   PS: Occasionally they hit cranks or jigs at the nuke plant, but corn seems to be the way to go."
