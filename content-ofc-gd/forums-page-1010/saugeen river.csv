Got out and caught alot of fish however i didn't have my camera with me, but i did get this one photo off a cell camera.  Caught 2 little specs a brown about half a pound a 2-3 pound muskie and an couple decent oos bass.  That river is awesome and i could only imagine how many more fish could be caught from a boat."
217954,jediangler,2008-06-22 03:41:00,1923,Nice pike armpit. I might be making a trip up to the school there in the near future. I'll be bringing my kayak with me for sure.
217961,Rich,2008-06-22 04:18:00,3927,I think your musky is a pike. Nice one though!
217965,lickmyarmpit,2008-06-22 05:32:00,359," Heres the ski sorry bout the quality and the  but i didnt ask for permission to post the pic, and it was taken with a cell phone."
217968,jonnybass,2008-06-22 07:18:00,346,"I'm confused.  In the first pic you're holding a pike which you didn't mention in your report.  In the second pic some other guy is holding a muskie which you don't have permission to post a pic of. I don't get it.  Also, what is that white stuff on the ground?"
217994,Rich,2008-06-22 14:20:00,3927,"Snow in June, must've been at the Saugeen in Nunavut"
217995,Dano,2008-06-22 14:25:00,719,"Yea. thats a great multi species river for sure.  Guys, that grass looks awfully green for a winter photo.....I dont think most cell phone cameras have the best optics or imaging capabilities, but on the upside, at least he knew what species it was."
217997,Rich,2008-06-22 14:29:00,3927,"You're right Dano, upon closer inspection I think that is the river, not snow. lol dang cell phone pics. I apologize for the snooty remark."
218000,Dano,2008-06-22 14:33:00,719,"Seemed a little out of character for you Rich, thought maybe you'd got out on the wrong side of bed this morning, no worries man!"
218012,Dabluz,2008-06-22 15:25:00,701,A person wearing a warm jacket....holding a ski.....snow in the picture....person wearing a long white beard (Santa Claus?).  Everything looks normal to me....lol
218023,Musky or Specks,2008-06-22 15:54:00,2710,When I was a kid we use to jump off that building in the background in this pic also the firehall bridge. When I see them now I just shake my head. Nice pike and definately one of the best rivers in southern ontario.
218054,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-22 18:08:00,0,Nice pike for a river fish! What did you catch the trouts on?
