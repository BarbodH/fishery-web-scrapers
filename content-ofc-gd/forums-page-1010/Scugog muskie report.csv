Around 20 casts in...wham!...muskie on...crappy hook set and shes off. Was able to get a look at her, nice size. Spent another half hour casting in the same area, Wham, another one. managed to get this one into the boat.    Put up a nice fight for a small muskie.    Managed another hit after this one but again the fish got off. Sun setting...time to hit the evening walleye spot. Sun goes down and out come the walleye/pickeral. Manged to get 5 walleye/pickeral to the boat."
217845,limeyangler,2008-06-21 16:46:00,5204,Nice fish CP....thatnks for sharing.
217855,musky66,2008-06-21 17:24:00,273,"Laying them on the carpet is not the best for them (not the worst either!) If you plane on targeting Musky, please invest in a decent net, and use it to release the fish from- still in the water. For photo's, keep them in the net until you're ready- lift 'em out, take pic, back in the water for release. Nice fish all the same!"
217864,cpguy29,2008-06-21 18:06:00,148,"I was thinking the same thing. I need to get a net to handle these fish better. I heard the rubber kind are the best, but what size?"
217866,glirw,2008-06-21 18:19:00,200,Nice fish!
217867,4thgen,2008-06-21 18:27:00,157,"Nice fish, sound like you had a productive trip but aren't those Colorado blades on that spinnerbait?"
217884,Master of Bait,2008-06-21 19:22:00,196,Nice ski dude.  Good lookin' fish.
217892,jediangler,2008-06-21 20:06:00,1923,Nice job. Good to see Scugog still producing small but very healthy looking skis.
218164,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-22 22:39:00,0,Nice ski! Sounds like you have the pickerel figured out. I hear they can be spotty on Scugog!
218169,Handlebarz,2008-06-22 22:52:00,3790,"glad ya got out but would hope if you are heading out for musky you would have the proper release tools please try and not lay them down on the bottom of the boat this is not good for them at all the slime will be taken off them. I  hope people here would not bash any one for doing this but just try and let them know that a good net or cradle would help out alot. Please invest in one if you are fishing by your self you can get a cheap tri pod for your camera and set the timer I do this all the time and get good shots and if I mess one up Oh well I still have the memory of the time. My favorite shot is of a nice fat 48"" I cut my head and her head and tail off it is a great shot and funny as all hell."
