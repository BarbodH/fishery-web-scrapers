217830,Master of Bait,2008-06-21 16:00:00,196,Those northern skis are gorgeous.  Nice fish.  Must've been a battle from shore like that.
217857,bigcreekdad,2008-06-21 17:30:00,546,"We had stopped for lunch on a large rock in middl of rapids. Caught him in a pool and he imediately went out of pool and down into fast water. Once he got into fast water he didn't like it any more than I and kept tring to get back up into pool, but when I put pressure on him...back to the fast water. Lots of fun!!"
