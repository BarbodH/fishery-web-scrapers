218002,duber,2008-06-22 14:42:00,220,Good deal but I notice the Canada map is not on the list.
218003,Guest lundboy,2008-06-22 14:47:00,0,There was an earlier post (within the last two weeks) about the chip and everyone said it wasn't of value in Canada.
218006,glen,2008-06-22 14:59:00,2641,The chips cost too much.
218213,Billy Bob,2008-06-23 00:54:00,5865,I cashed in on this rebate. I sent in all my proofs of purchase in mid April and FINALLY received the map card yesterday.  The funny thing is I purchased a Navionics card for $149 for the eastern US and a week later I heard about this deal so I put in for the south of US. Now I think I will sell it on Ebay.
218218,danc,2008-06-23 01:06:00,4677,Bottom line is this. Your new GPS is worthless without a couple of hundreds of bucks worth of maps. No matter what brand you choose.
218310,brickNblock,2008-06-23 05:20:00,598,"G, you dont get the free chip when you buy the unit..... You get the free chip after you purchase the Navionics chip.  Readitnweep fellas! I bought the Navionics 'Gold' chip.....when I bought my 522iGPS \ ...shows BayOfQuinte (what I wanted) ..ALL of the GreatLakes, ...ALL of the Kawarthas....STUNNING! LakeoftheWoods, OttawaNSt.Lawrence Rivers, LakeStClair, Simcoe, Scugog, GeorgianBay, Niagra all G-L Tribs and the Maritimes...also the complete Trent-Severn Waterway......Heck, I was reading the shore line and surrounding waters of my backyard..whilst sitting in the boat/trailered in my yard.......its awesome!..Im on the Trent between locks 6-7 (297' waterfront)   ...with this purchase I also recieved Free....... THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR FREE..............You also get the chip that shows the high deff of the shore line and surrounding lands to water bottom contours...(in 3-d).  I was happy enough with the gold chip alone...the free contour chip was a bonus and an exellent one to boot.  I purchase most everything .what I need for fishing from (spam) Gagnon's in Oshawa, Its a hourNhalf drive West for me but they do me well and have done over the years.....(35+yrs) I looked over my receipts from them these past few purchases and I recieve 10% off everything and in brackets on the reciept it says...""Preferred Customer"" Not only that but,....they price match first...then I get the additional 10% off. TRY N BEAT THAT ANYWHERE."
218312,brickNblock,2008-06-23 05:39:00,598,"Yes the boat was trailered in the yard...I have been working hard on the addition to my shop/office and havent had much fishing time.  and I dont normally dock at my launch..(its for my tinny mostly)..not the big boat. Takes too long to get down to the BOQ thru the locks...much quicker to drive it down. The tinny is handy if I want to go out for an hour or so....waiting for the wifey to cook dinner or first thing in the morning before work.  Fellas, the Navionics chip is well worth the $$$$ my only beef is that I now wish I purchased the Platinum instead of the gold chip... 'supose its always the way with everything tho....."
218319,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-23 09:12:00,0,"I still have my gold chip navionics and it is great  but the hotmaps platinum by navionics for canada 08 edition is way superior and has hi definition maps and got on sale for $129.99  it shows all sorts of stuff almost information overload at times  Over 450 high-definition maps to 1' contours of select lakes from Navionics' own surveys plus an additional 12,000 lakes. New features for 2008 include extensive professional angler input, more underwater structure, major roads, county lines, and more high-definition bottom surveys."
