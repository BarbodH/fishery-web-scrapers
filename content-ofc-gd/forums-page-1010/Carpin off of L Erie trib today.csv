Had the creek all to myself most of the day.  I caught this 25"" carp using a bait mix of: oatmeal and peanut butter on a # 6 lazer hook ( no hair rig either! lol)>>    and the guy I fished with last Monday night caught this one with the same set up( about 5 inches longer and 5lbs heavier)>>    .............................  heading out for some perch in the morning off of Port Stanley(Lake Erie)  Splashhopper"

217721,Master of Bait,2008-06-21 01:18:00,196,Nice fish.  Gotta love that we can access these great fish so close to home.  I think you need to tussle with a good one or two to really appreciate how fun it can be.  Great pics.
