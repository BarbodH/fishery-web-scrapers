217604,Victor,2008-06-20 17:16:00,1609,congrats on completing another year of school. Being in university and working on a co-op job right now ... my piece of advice to you is that ... enjoy the summers while you still have'em. Soon time you'll be spending most of it doing a summer job or taking summer school.  Enjoy it!

217618,tbayboy,2008-06-20 18:14:00,1497,"Congrats Mike, enjoy the summer.  Victor - a few years from now you'll appreciate those lost co-op summers, school meant diddly it was the co-op placements that made U Waterloo worth going to (now summer terms on campus - those were a load of unprintable here fun)."

I'm on a plane heading to BC 4 hours later. Up to Terrace BC the next day. Spooning Chinook on the Skenna river the following morning.  <- this silly icony thingy doesn't even remotely do my grin justice.
