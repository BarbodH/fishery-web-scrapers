218272,pokerdemon4,2008-06-23 02:46:00,135,Musky bait.
218273,danc,2008-06-23 02:47:00,4677,Rainbow darter Danbo? That was my guess.
218275,danc,2008-06-23 02:48:00,4677,  You use 2 and 3 inch minnows for Musky??
218277,danbo,2008-06-23 02:48:00,2646,For sure Bro
218278,danc,2008-06-23 02:49:00,4677, Thanks Bud...
218279,muskymike,2008-06-23 02:49:00,772,Looks like some sort of fish to me
218293,Sinker,2008-06-23 03:21:00,8692,"Yup, rainbow darter. Man, I've been trying to get one of them for a long time to add to a minnow aquarium we have at work......I can't seem to get one.  Would you mind sharing what kind of habitat they came out of?  I've got most types of minnows, but these guys are pretty rare for some reason around here......either that, or I'm looking in the wrong places...?  Sinker"
218295,ehg,2008-06-23 03:23:00,2666,"Caught a 12 inch brookie that spat a Rainbow Darter up a couple years ago. Apparently an indication of good water quality. Good news, as this fish was caught very close to Toronto. "
218298,Sinker,2008-06-23 03:26:00,8692,"Yep.....very good indicators to see. Would you mind sharing where that one came from ehg? I don't want your brookies.....I""m more interested in the darter....LOL. I have my own spots for brookies, thanks  Even just the type of habitat it came from would be a good start......  Sinker"
218300,ehg,2008-06-23 03:30:00,2666,Sinker the one i found was in brook trout from a L. Ontario eastern trib headwater. The most colourful little things i've seen. Hope you catch one. ehg
218306,Sinker,2008-06-23 03:37:00,8692," I figured.......that's where I've been trying...LOL. I work on those tribs everyday, and still can't seem to find one. They're right up there with the elusive ogopogo.....  Sinker"
