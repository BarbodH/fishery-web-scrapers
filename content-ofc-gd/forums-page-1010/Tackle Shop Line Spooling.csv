After I purchased it (at JB's) Steve asked if i wanted it spooled. ""How much?"" I say. He looks at his chart and says $22. I couldnt be more surprised. A 300 yard spool of 80 or 100# PP is almost $80. I got backing, the line and it was spooled for me for $29 plus tax. yes i know the numbers dont jive, but he told me $22 and it cost $29 oh well.  I was amazed at the price difference.  Once again, Good On Ya JB's. Now Steve, where is my hat???"
218287,MJL,2008-06-23 03:01:00,2427,"In the States a lot of the lines are almost half (Some even less than half) the price of what we pay here in Canada.  300yards of 65lb PowerPro costs around $25 at Cabelas or BassPro (add $4 for 80-100lb).  I always smuggle a few spools back with me when I travel over.  Failing that, my friends bring stuff back for me for cheap when they travel to the US."
218290,muskymike,2008-06-23 03:05:00,772,"I usually buy it there, but the 1500 yard spools are pretty much identical. If I can find them cheaper I will get it at the lowest cost possible."
218291,jace,2008-06-23 03:09:00,472,"Generally speaking, spooling high test gel spun lines on the bigger reels shouldn't be done at home anyways because you can't put enough tension on it, not easily anyways."
218334,BillM,2008-06-23 11:43:00,17367,JB's spooled my Okuma Induron for nothing (I purchased the 50lb SpiderWire Ultracast).  Didn't charge me for the 20lb mono backing or anything..  Great guys over there.  Now if I could only christen the wrong word rod with a musky I'd be alot happier
