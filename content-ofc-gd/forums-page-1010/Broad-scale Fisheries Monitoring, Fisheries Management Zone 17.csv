217398,Ron,2008-06-19 23:29:00,1683,"RE: Broad-scale Fisheries Monitoring, Fisheries Management Zone 17 Ecological Framework for Fisheries Management During the summer of 2008, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) crews will be conducting netting operations on a series of lakes in Fisheries Management Zone 17. The lakes scheduled for assessment in 2008 include: White (Dummer) Lake - June 10-1 3 Dalrymple Lake - June 16-20 Cordova Lake - June 23-27 Buckhorn Lake (Upper) - July 2-1 1 Stony and Clear Lake -July 14-23 Lake Scugog - July 27 - August 1 Canal Lake - August 5-8 Buckhorn Lake (Lower) - August 10-1 5 Rylstone Lake - August 19-22 This operation is part of the broad-scale fisheries monitoring program which MNR began implementing across Ontario earlier this spring. (See attached fact sheet). The crews of technicians and biologists will collect and record a variety of information from the fish caught during the netting surveys, including fish species, sex, age, length, weight, and general health. This will be used to determine sport fish abundance, life history characteristics of key species, and the diversity of the fish community. Some fish will also be sampled to assess contaminant levels. The net sets will be clearly marked with MNR buoys, and we are asking recreational users to avoid activities in these areas. Some of the netting operations are overnight gill net sets, and some fish mortality may occur. This is generally low, and most of these fish will be used for contaminant sampling.  We are requesting you share this information with your members and other lake users, to help us inform people using the lake during these activities, and take the necessary precautions in the immediate area. We have also attached a Notice regarding this activity, which we will post at public boat launches and various retail stores and outlets located on the lake. If you are aware of other public areas where they may be posted to inform lake users, please feel free to do so. We would be happy to provide you with a report back on our preliminary findings following the netting, if you or your organization are interested. For example, we could provide the number and type of fish caught, general observations, etc., before the data is fully analyzed. Please contact the name below to make these arrangements. We would also be pleased to provide you with the State of the Resource Report, once the final analysis of data collected from across the region has been completed and the report compiled. We deeply appreciate your help and cooperation in monitoring our fish populations and the health of our lakes. Please feel free to contact Dan Taillon at 705-755-2001 (email [emailÂ protected]), for preliminary results from your lake, the State of the Resource Report when its available, or if you have any questions or concerns.  Sincerely, Jane Ireland Ministry of Natural Resources Peterborough District Manager"

217456,Sinker,2008-06-20 02:15:00,8692,Thanks Ron!!  What exactly do they mean by broad scale species?  Forget that......found some more info here:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_166749.html  Sinker
217561,mdej,2008-06-20 14:10:00,98,You would think they would have done these studies prior to rezoning everything.
