At first I thought they were fish rising for a hatch, but closer looks showed them coming to the surface and doing 2-3 tight circles then diving for bottom again.  Was that a baitfish spawn?  Never got a close look at them but they were middle sized bait fish, 6""-8"", def not the usual shiners or chubs I see down there.  Is it alewife spawning season?  I'll try and get some video tonight."

To be honest I'm not sure if it was just a school of fish hunting shads down by trapping them on the surface or if there was some mating going on.  Bring on the pics!"
