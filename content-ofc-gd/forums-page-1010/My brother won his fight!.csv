Well he won and I wrote up a whole play by play with pictures on another site, here: http://www.sherdog.net/forums/f61/raw-comb...-photos-801910/  For MMA fans, David Loiseau, Travis Galbraith, Doug Evans and Dan Hornbuckle were also on the card."

218041,steverowbotham,2008-06-22 17:28:00,1800,"My brother lived and trained in Thunder Bay all last year, so him and Nate are good buddies.  He won by rear naked choke in round 1, the fight wasnt even close.  The kid is a monster, he's 5-0 now."
