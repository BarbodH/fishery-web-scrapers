217679,jwl,2008-06-20 22:26:00,1056,sometimes nice muskies can be so elusive even the picture gets away
217724,maybe,2008-06-21 01:31:00,307,Congrats on getting the pic back!!  Thanks for letting us know - I was wondering how you'd made out.  CCMT's guide to posting pics should get you set up in no time.
