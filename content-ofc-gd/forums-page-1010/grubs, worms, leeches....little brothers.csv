218160,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-22 22:33:00,2585,"good question about bait.  I have heard of people using field mice for pike and musky and big bass, never seen it for myself. Personally if its legal to use small animals i couldnt imagine putting the hook through it.  Not really sure which is legal and which isnt.  interesting question, i have regs with me so i will look it up.  Cheers!"
