Cradle them.  2 - Bleeding around the mouth, release the fish ASAP.  3 - Try not to weight the carp by the gill plate, like I said before it's delicate.  4 - Carp scales come off fairley easily, try to place the carp on grass or a carp landing mat*. Placing them on rocks and gravel will injure the fish.  The contest is at http://community.ontariocarphunters.com  Lets see the stories!!  Daniel OCH"
