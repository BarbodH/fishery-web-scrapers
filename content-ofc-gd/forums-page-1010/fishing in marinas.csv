217616,purekgw,2008-06-20 17:59:00,585,i live on scott st we take the boat out like  every weekend so you might have seen us its a 02 crestliner fishhawk
217637,GBW,2008-06-20 19:35:00,8460,is it ok if I post a link to another board of a tv show host who had the same problem and posted about the whole situation?
217641,Terry,2008-06-20 19:56:00,14456,post it
217647,GBW,2008-06-20 20:17:00,8460,here you go. http://www.hookmorefish.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=1607
217661,snag,2008-06-20 21:05:00,1932,"So basically,  If you are floating on the body of water you're good?  No anchor, mooring or setting foot on private property.  That would kill the shore fishing unless it's public property with no signs posted.  Am I missing anything here?  That was a great effort from Shaun,  Thanks for posting that!"
217669,tdotfisherman,2008-06-20 21:46:00,317,"I shore fish quite a bit around a local marina and haven't caughten any flack about that, but I've also seen lots of people fishing in boats as well, and they don't seem to be doing anything wrong, or being bothered by any of the workers there. As long as the angler isn't being disrespectful to anybody's property, or getting in anyone's way, I dont see why it would be such a big issue."
217686,musky66,2008-06-20 23:16:00,273,It is a big issue when a million dollar boat gets dinged or has line hanging from it. I work security at a Marina and we will not let people fish from the docks or enclosed shoreline. We try to discourage boaters from fishing for the above reasons but we haven't been called on the law yet. I understand both sides of the argument but some fishermen are so darn rude and uncaring it does ruin it for all.
217695,jwl,2008-06-20 23:46:00,1056," the part about some rude so called ""fishermen"" says it all right there, and ruins alot of options for alot of people.    I for one would sure not to start the motor up on my $100 thousand or more boat to find out that someone fishing got thier line all stuck around my prop, or hooks in my mooring cover, dings ect, not to mention the expensive property that gets scored off people's boats every season as well.  it's a tough call to make, and really no one does own the water so to speak, but some marinas can say they sort of own the parts they built specially if it is a harbour type setting constructed up inner and outer breakwalls."
217735,purekgw,2008-06-21 01:54:00,585,Jwl i know what you mean about hittin boats and crap but we fish around them i dont cast right at them i try to avoid gettin in any ones way so i dunno we goin again tomorow tho )
217736,barrystrs,2008-06-21 01:56:00,75,"On scugog the owner of a private canal put a cable across to keep boats out.  It is a great spot for crappies.  If you are not allowed to touch a dock, does this mean you cannot touch the cable?  A small boat could be pushed over the top of the cable using paddles.  Any comments?"
217780,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-21 04:36:00,835,"Someone digs a channel into the lake doesn't make it private, cable should be removed for safety as its a hazard to navigation."
217783,pikehunter,2008-06-21 08:28:00,1659,I would just like to know why it makes a difference to some people that the monetary value of a boat makes a difference? If I was to get a nick in my tinnies paint from a careless fisherman I would be just as ticked off as the guy who is in debt up to his wazoo for a half million dollar canoe!  Value doesn't make a difference! Just use some common sense when fishing around anyone's personal property and there isn't a problem. Respect is all it takes. If fisherfolk disrespect then see how long it takes for the rules or laws to change.
217881,purekgw,2008-06-21 19:16:00,585,well we fished the same marina we did before today and well i wish bass was open cause i seen one beast of a large mouth follow my spinner i seen him come for it and pulled it away as fast as i could o well mabye next weekend
217325,purekgw,2008-06-19 19:43:00,585,you see it all the time on fishing shows but is this aloud when we were fishing a marina for pike a guy who works there told us we couldn't fish in there so is it aloud and can they do any thing?
217329,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-19 19:48:00,2585,they dont own the water.  If you are fishing in a boat then you are ok.  If you are standing on there docks then thats a different story.  Cheers!
217331,purekgw,2008-06-19 19:50:00,585,ya we have a boat i can under stand if some one was hitting the boats or something
217333,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-19 19:52:00,2585,well i would hope your not bouncing your baits off the boats in there.  i owuld freak out to if someone chucked a jig an dpig off my boat.  Cheers!
217334,purekgw,2008-06-19 19:53:00,585,yah i try to avoid goin right for boats i aim more for the docks
217338,misfish,2008-06-19 19:58:00,29133,"But the fish are under the boats.LOL This is the number one reason why someone will ask you to leave the marina. Not all will,but the up nose turned right ones do. If I am asked,I leave ( I get tired of arguing with these people),sometimes I get the odd one that says,theres a big one under here."
217339,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:01:00,585,lol but if you skip ur bait under the dock and bring it off the bow of boat or the stern  i dont cast right at the sides of the boats
217340,snag,2008-06-19 20:02:00,1932," Not true,  Unfortunately, some marinas have a type of ""Lease"" from the government that gives them control over the land and body of water. Typically, this usually occurs with marinas that are enclosed.  You would have to research the deed and ownership of the marina."
217341,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:06:00,585,ahh i got some research to do
217343,uglyfish,2008-06-19 20:10:00,981,"better yet, just ask them for the proof that they own the water... if they don;t provide it, enjoy ur fishing my friend! remember... it is illegal for someone to interfere or harrass with an angler who is lawfully fishing."
217344,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:12:00,585,but we bout a season pass could they revoke it?
217346,Terry,2008-06-19 20:15:00,14456,"and they are to have signs from the gov. stating they have been given control of the water in the marina..most don't and the cops are on the owners side  I was kicked out of a marina  the owner told me he owned the water and I must leave , I disagreed and he called the cops...the cop told me I had to leave.. I said that he and the marina were wrong and I do have the right to fish there....leave or be charged...I left   I made phone calls went go copies of the law went to the cop shop..the same cop was there the duty officer was there they said.. yup looks like you are right..and the cop said well I had know idea who was right, but I didn't care, my job was to end the situation and I did..case closed....so bottom line you will be kicked out of the marina unless you have legal documents  to prove you can be there or a gun to shoot the stupid  cop"
217348,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:17:00,585,lol i dunno about gun but next time we go ima ask them if they have owner ship of it i dout they do
217350,snag,2008-06-19 20:18:00,1932," Pure, where are you from?  I'm trying to figure out your accent"
217351,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:21:00,585,lol im from Caledonia (right out side of hamilton) ands its just they way i talk because of msn lol
217355,snag,2008-06-19 20:24:00,1932, Just teasing! Good sense of humour
217356,purekgw,2008-06-19 20:29:00,585,bass CMON AND OPEN ALREADY!!!
217361,Rich,2008-06-19 20:47:00,3927,"Ahh, I love the people who try to kick you out of marinas when you're in the boat. Always fun to win an argument."
217365,BassMan11,2008-06-19 21:00:00,583,"My dad actually manages a marina and there are no fishing signs posted on the outside gates. Usually during the peak boating season (summer) he kicks people out who try and fish there, but during early spring and late fall when only a few boats are in he doesn't mind it. He doesn't even let me fish there in the summer!!."
217367,forrest,2008-06-19 21:24:00,1032,"  So if you had the papers of proof on you it sounds like you would be OK, right? Is the information you have good for all Ontario bodies of water?  Can you post 'em?  forrest"
217371,Terry,2008-06-19 21:44:00,14456,"I am looking for them but no luck finding the info so far It was posted on this site before, I think I left my copy in my bass boat that  I sold but still checking"
217470,Nemo,2008-06-20 02:40:00,727,See in the FAQ question section under  Who owns the water?  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=12716
