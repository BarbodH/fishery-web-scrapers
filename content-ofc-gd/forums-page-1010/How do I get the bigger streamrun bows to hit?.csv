217903,BillM,2008-06-21 21:20:00,17367,"Hit a local stream again this morning with pretty good results..  2-3 brookies and a crapload of small bows (8inch was about the biggest) I did however spot a monster (to me anyhow, lol) It was a good 2lb fish.  It took a bit of interest in my Mepps #0 silver spinner but never made a swipe at it.  Same thing went with some of the bigger brook trout I spotted.  Lots of interest but no hits.   Should I try slow drifting worms or roe perhaps?  I would think a worm, small hook and no weight would be a pretty natural presentation..   No way I'd ever get a flyrod in there, the banks are just way to overgrown...  To bad I forgot the damn camera, some of those brookies had some amazing colours to them!"
217908,Musky or Specks,2008-06-21 21:37:00,2710,Give dewage a try just like you said no weight just a hook. Has always worked for me. One thing you might want to try with the bigger trout. Wait till after a good rain colours up the water some.
217910,BillM,2008-06-21 21:53:00,17367,"Ah, I thought it was a bad idea to fish when the water was stained..  I guess I should give that a shot"
217914,purekgw,2008-06-21 22:01:00,585,keep buggin it will hit it out of rage
217915,Musky or Specks,2008-06-21 22:04:00,2710,Im not talking chocolate milk just a little colour I find the bigger fish seem to loose their cautious attitude.
217916,Burtess,2008-06-21 22:08:00,901,"Try a live minnow, those trout don't get big just eating insects...  or a small Rapala in rainbow trout colour...  Burt"
217918,BillM,2008-06-21 22:16:00,17367,/takes notes..  Didn't even think about a small Rapala   Thanks for the tips guys!
217921,tdotfisherman,2008-06-21 22:38:00,317,I wouldn't give up on spinners Bill. I was fishing a local trib and used decent sized gold and black in-line spinners and I caught some HUGE steelhead. Try to match the hatch (creek chub) and you might have some good results.
217923,BillM,2008-06-21 22:41:00,17367,"They really seemed to like the Blue Fox #0 Gold/Silver.  I tried a 1/32 ounce Panther Martin with the fly on the hook and they weren't to interested.  Haven't tried any of the Mepps black fury's I have, next time (maybe tomorrow morning, lol) I'll have to give that a shot."
217933,BillM,2008-06-22 00:20:00,17367,Anyone ever try leeches?  They last so much longer then worms
217975,ketchenany,2008-06-22 11:57:00,3229,I have them trained Bill. Carry a sign telling them I sent you  :clapping:LOL  Good stuff at least you got out . . .
218177,BillM,2008-06-22 23:08:00,17367,I knew there had to be a reason  :)
