217977,oldphart,2008-06-22 12:22:00,665,"~~Day started at my place with Slug showing up with another bud name Kang, who has never caught any Whities before, or phished from a boat, we headed up to Sibalds, for a Charity Tourney, to help a bud who has Throat Cancer, and no benefit. We were hoping to get our coffee fix at Coffee Time, on 48 only to find it not open yet, great day starting great no coffee, Slug say don't worry buddy Horseshoes is bring it. We arrived early, way too early, could have slept in, an extra hour, before the next boat arrive for the tourney. So I decided to have some fun with the Sunnies, and tied on a red body, white tail micro twister tail, on a slip Bobber set up and cast around, a few cast and no action could see some, but no interest, cast out deep, and just gave it a twitch, when ""Phish On"" it started running, and I thought I might have a good size Sunny on line, then it ran for the dock cribs, and we got a look at it it's a Pike great, yelled ""Get the Net, I need this for our on line tourney"" It was going this way, and then it went that way, and finally after 3 swipes with the net, we land it only to find it's not a Pike, but a Bowfin, my very first, got camera filled out the form   and got it back into the water, and I knew my day had gone to pot, we all have had those days where you catch the first phish, and that's it, oh well I guess I'll be the camera man again. So after we finally were able to sign up, and find out Horsey didn't,t bring the coffee, we took off for my hidden Whitey Spot, and sure enough there was about 30 boats already on it, oh well, we will just have to phish where were are in 82' where I was marking some active phish on the bottom. Sure enough Slug had the active hook, took him 10 hook ups before he got one to stay on, here he is re-tieing after losing 7 in a row  He kept checking his hook to see if it was dull, and no I didn't flatten his barb down, at least you can't prove it. Our Newbie in the bow, was having a few hits took him a while how to use a Shoal Digger, but then he say ""I got one"" told him to bring it in real slow, and rod tip up, and sure enough it nears surface, and I said it's a Laker, and Slug was there with the net   his very first Laker, he liken this type of phishen, no more white bucket for him, he's no longer a Virgin, he moven up to a red bucket. Well the day went on Winston called, some ass anchour 15' away from him and Brooktrout, so I told him where we were, and they came over, and it wasn't to long before they were into them here's BT just finished releasing one while Winston was trying to keep his away from the anchour line   as in his report he ran a foul of the anchour line a few times, the action was not stop for Slug, he had on over 40 phish for the day, landing about 15, and while I was taking taking this pic of him Kang had one on,   his first Whitey, but don't despair I didn't come home empty handed I was able to land 2 of the 6 phish I had on 1 Whitey, and 1 Laker  last shot of the day Slug releasing a small whitey  The wind started picking up so we headed in had to be back at the park for one to weigh in, seems one guy went over to Cooks to phish for Carp and came in with a big one, which won him Bragging rights, all the money raised went tothe charity, It was a great day on and off the water, and the only reason I'm at home writing this now, weatherman is calling for Thunderstorm on Lake X."

Good job on the lakers, I did see a lot of people hooking up a lot for most of the am. Perfect day for it with light winds as well. Good pictures and glad to see you out enjoying a great fishery and great day.  Cheers AL"
