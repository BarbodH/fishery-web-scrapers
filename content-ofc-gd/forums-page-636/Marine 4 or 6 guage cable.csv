Will 4 or 6 g regular copper wire work from HD, Rona etc?  Need to know so I can go the this stuff and install 12v 36lb trolling motor. I have circuit, connectors etc... just need the wire. Thanks "
500626,Tybo,2010-09-01 20:08:00,1373,"Any industrial hardware store. visco,concord hardware."
500640,DRIFTER_016,2010-09-01 21:24:00,10439,Here you go.  Marine grade wire  Marine grade wire is tinned to combat corosion.
500646,dave524,2010-09-01 21:37:00,4508,"I needed heavy wire once for a high amp draw mobile radio, quick solution, CTC had booster cables on sale, cut the clamps off, was probably cheaper than buying it by the foot at a shop."
500685,livinisfishin,2010-09-01 23:31:00,661,Think I'm going to do that to...never actually priced out the wire though.
500717,baironhorse,2010-09-02 01:14:00,145,too expensive when you factor in xchange and taxes + duties

500719,baironhorse,2010-09-02 01:20:00,145,I need a 20 - 23 ft run so cables won't work for me

500751,John Bacon,2010-09-02 02:36:00,3277,When I installed my electric bow mount in the mid-ninties I used regular outdoor wire from Home Depot and ran it under the floor from the stern to the bow.  I had the boat up last year and it never gave me a problem.  Luckily Alumicraft had ran ABS pipe from stern to bow so it made running the wire a little easier.  That and two extra circuits pre-wired at the bow were a nice touch.
500768,decamo,2010-09-02 03:53:00,9,Go to any decent car audio store and they will have 4-6 ga wire.  Costs a bit but you definately want to have the proper wire in place with a good fuse.
500797,scugpg,2010-09-02 10:27:00,1373,Princess should have welding cable at a reasonable price. Like others said a car audio shop should have 4ga wire.
501077,blue pickeral,2010-09-03 10:00:00,267," Please do not do this. I used heavy gauge CT booster cables once to extend wiring to a starter battery and within a year, the insulation fell off! Did not notice as it was a hidden run, but could have been a disaster grounding to aluminum hull!  I bought proper marine cable at Port Whitby Marine, likely other marine supply places have it."
501235,aplumma,2010-09-03 21:18:00,6896, All marine wires to code must be stranded the sold wire for houses is a no no it can start a fire and will break at the connections from vibration and stress. That said it looks like you have had some success though for the past 10 plus years.   Art
