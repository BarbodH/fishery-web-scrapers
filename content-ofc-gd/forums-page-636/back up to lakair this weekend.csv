500658,SBCregal,2010-09-01 22:10:00,688,we're heading back up to lakair again for the labour day weekend.  we were up there earlier in the summer and the fishing was reaaaaaaally tough.  im sure the water level hasnt come up much since then but does anybody know how the fishing has been in the area?  it'd be nice to actually catch something up there this time   ryan
