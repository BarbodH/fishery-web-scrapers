501129,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-03 15:24:00,4399,"That`s fine everybody has an opinion and is entilted to it, having said that I myself and I am sure many more in this community would prefer not to support someone who does not respect our fishing regulations. And I must say I am a little surprised that you support a poacher but hey your entitled to do that if you like!"
501163,Terry,2010-09-03 17:08:00,14456,"we did have more then our fair share of problems with the place but nothing that was unforgivable.....it was only mouse turds...  I was POed that they charged us for guaranteed dock spots, didn't tell any of the employees about it and didn't charge anyone one except OFNers and we came back at the end of fishing for the day and there was no docking spots and it was ""oh well nothing we can do ""  but in the end it's the only place I know of that can house all the people that show up for the BOQ M&G.......  so I would go back and give them another try......but that's just me....we will see what the masses do this year for the M&G"
501167,Joey,2010-09-03 17:26:00,9122," Well we have had the same problems at Merlands that we have had at many other places, including Lakair, yet we all go back there.  I've gone back to places where I didn't particularly like the owners, nor the accomodations, but really liked the area and lake and the fishing was great.  I spend most of my time on the lake so all the rest is time spent re-energizing with food and drink and catching a few naps, and at G2G's, seeing members/friends.  Everyone has their own opinion and that's fine, but it looks like the BOQ G2G is never going to be the same, which is a bummer.  Might as well just not bother going anymore"
501190,mbac31,2010-09-03 19:10:00,904,"I will never stay at Merlands again after last winter a druck guy staying there ran over all my gear and owners never gave a crap about anything. I took pictures of the guys plate number and them as well but nothing was done. Ruined over $1000 worth of gear. I should have gone to a lawyer about it but oh well. Beware, the owners dont give a crap about anything. Sorry but its not a good site when they allow guys to drive around drunk on their property damaging others stuff. Take your money and run sort of thing. I have steered a few away from staying there now, sorry Shawn but thats how it is. I never promote someone like that"
501198,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-03 19:24:00,144,"Sorry guys, not getting in on this. The way I see it, opinions are like arses, everyone has one... lol!  Hope you all have a great Fall season, regardless of where you choose to stay and/or fish.  Cheers, Shaun"
501199,Pigeontroller,2010-09-03 19:24:00,2793,Hey Shaun whatever happened to your fishing show? I always enjoyed it.
501208,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-03 19:46:00,144,"Stay tuned mate  Nice Musky in your Avatar by the way  Cheers, Shaun"
501210,mbac31,2010-09-03 19:46:00,904,"  To Funny Shaun, Only an Englishmen or Newfie would say that.   My favorite saying from my Pop most of my life growing up and I still use it daily.  Hope to see you on the water. Have a good fall."
501216,Squid,2010-09-03 19:54:00,1656,This post should be moved to cottages and resorts no?
501292,solopaddler,2010-09-04 00:34:00,8605,"  Maybe so Shaun, but usually where there's smoke there's fire. People on here are generally just as quick to praise as to criticize.   On a side note I have to say I always enjoyed your show as well as your delicious beer. "
501295,Terry,2010-09-04 00:47:00,14456, I agree 100%
501334,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-04 02:48:00,0," The mouse turds is nasty enough, but not having dock space that you payed for?That would really make me fume!Sounds like this guy is all about taking your money and after that your on your own. And you think he'd be making enough money as to not have to poach lakers but i guess not....  My friend owns bass cove right next door. Unfortunately he only has a few cottages, but hopefully in the near future he will build more.  Reminds me of a place called foresters on BOQ. These guys had the worst service from what I hear but location aided them."
501367,fish_fishburn,2010-09-04 11:53:00,1311,"Smalliefisher, maybe you should of taken up your problem with the guy that ran over your gear. running to the camp owner crying about some guy who ran over your gear is your problem not the owners. And as far as blaming the owners for letting someone drive that has been drinking, Give me a break man. The owners are probably glad that your not coming back."
501370,Roy,2010-09-04 12:15:00,13728,"OK, let's all leave it at that and see what the fall will bring. Just a little compassion wouldn't hurt. But,we'll see."

500693,solopaddler,2010-09-02 00:03:00,8605,  Me too. I also became a fan other resorts after staying at Merlands once.
500696,canadadude,2010-09-02 00:17:00,769,hahahahahahaha aw man good one
500723,Gerritt,2010-09-02 01:27:00,6129,"  as have many of us... want mouse turds with you're steak? or the dock of death?... where paying for a slip means nothing... then become a fan!  fanboys unite,  G"
500728,Terry,2010-09-02 01:34:00,14456,yeah but the BOQ trips have never been the same once most of us started staying at many different places  we really need to find a place big enough and close enough on the water to suit everyone
500729,GBW,2010-09-02 01:37:00,8460,"Joe told me about the ""bum slide"" down the dock, HAHAHAHA  Sorry Shaun, but there are a LOT here that think otherwise..."
500732,Terry,2010-09-02 01:39:00,14456,the bum slide  LOL... I had forgot
500733,GBW,2010-09-02 01:42:00,8460,"Terry, I was Told by Joe (HH) that I must go this year but there is NO WAY I will stay at a resort that ask's for your cash and doesn't give a ""mouse's"" xxx about you other then when it's time to pay.  I can deal with the vermon, not an issue, but the operators are an issue when I spend my hard earned $$ to be there..."
500738,bigfish1965,2010-09-02 01:52:00,3382," You owe me a keyboard, bugger!!"
500746,anonymous,2010-09-02 02:15:00,58, But how many people can you fit in a cabin? And who almost got hit by your truck while it was luge'ing down the boat ramp?
500759,solopaddler,2010-09-02 02:57:00,8605," Is this a trick question like ""How many OFC'ers does it take to screw in a light bulb?""  BTW how many people can you fit in a cabin?"
500780,brifishrgy,2010-09-02 06:12:00,559,"  depends on the cabin you get, dont count on getting the one you reserved  as far as becoming a fan, NEVER going to support a poacher  The only thing Merlands has going for it is location"
500785,tknohpy,2010-09-02 08:37:00,162,I have a trailer at Perfect Vue...anyone ever looked into staying there?
500794,fish_fishburn,2010-09-02 09:54:00,1311,So I gather this is not the place to book a trip with to the B.O.Q.? Anyone care to elaborate cause I am booked there for the end of November. Our reason for booking there was #1 the location and we got a nice cabin. Are there other camps in the same general location that I should look into for next year?
500795,Roy,2010-09-02 10:17:00,13728," You'll be fine there. You've got to understand that the mood of a thread is set at the very start of it. People like jumping on someone who's down...it's almost as though they've never made a mistake themselves. I've never had problems at Merland but then... I've never needed an owner of a camp to kiss my butt because I had given them a few bucks for the use of a cottage. When we go there, it's November. It's a sure thing that you'll have frost/ice on the docks. All the tough guys who rant about their expertise in the bush who are complaining here should probably sleep at a Holiday Inn and get a taxi to bring them to their boat in the mornings. I have a little more to say but I'll leave it at that. Fish_Fishburn, have a great time there, catch lots and send us a report when you're back."
500798,fish_fishburn,2010-09-02 10:31:00,1311,"Thanks Roy. I was feeling the same about the previous posts. Sounds like alot of sour grapes to me. I am going there to fish,drink and eat in that order. I don't really care if I see the owners during my stay unless I need them for something. We have the Mikey Bigfish cabin right on the water and I can't wait. If there is anyone else going to be staying or around there let me know, Our gang will be there from Nov 25 to the 28."
500816,Gerritt,2010-09-02 11:57:00,6129,  Hahahaha! I forgot about that! good thing the door was open! it saved my truck from becoming structure!!
500819,solopaddler,2010-09-02 12:04:00,8605,  Maybe so Roy but my comment had nothing to do with OFC. It was completely unrelated and happened years before the current distate towards Merlands surfaced on OFC.  From my perspective it just confirmed what I already knew.
500822,Roy,2010-09-02 12:21:00,13728,"I understand, Mike. I respect you as a fisherman and all around good guy. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. I just gave mine is all. You gave your opinion and that's cool...I gave mine and that should be cool too. We have a member who has booked there for November with some friends let's let him make up his own mind. Crap might have happened a few years ago...let it go. No one has said anything about what Kevin has done to rectify any problems that might have occured in the past. It's kind of like a gang mentality. I'm sorry you had a bad time there. Maybe I'm just not as fussy as you are. Lord willing, I'll make it out there again in the late fall this year. I'll be there for the fishing and comraderie. It's a good place for everyone to get together in the same spot.  EDIT: And I don't know the Lavers at all. Would not recognize them on the street."
500823,lew,2010-09-02 12:27:00,12766,"I've only ever stayed at Merlins once and that was the 1st ever OFC fall g2g a few years back and it was a very positive experience.  Myself & 3 others had a cabin booked and when I got there early I commented to the owners that the cabin may be too small for our group. Without hesitation they moved us into a large cabin, number 10 if I remember correctly, and only charged us the fee for the small cabin.  I'd go back again."
500854,Headhunter,2010-09-02 14:14:00,5703,"I agree with you Roy, a gang mentality can quickly get out of hand. And I also agree that a member has indicated that they are booked there and are looking for advice etc... That being said, I also think it would be contrary to this community’s mission to not let the member know about past problems, members have had there. As has been mentioned by many here, the advantage that Merlands has over other ""resorts"" is it's location and it's ability to hold large numbers of people. There are however other options, but those don't include the all ""important"" fire pit. From my perspective, if folks are being ""asked"" to forgive perceived short comings at one resort, shouldn't  the same be said for one that doesn't have a fire pit? Because really, I am not going there to stare into a fire, I am going to meet up with old friends, make new one's, have few wobbly pops and catch some beauty Pickereyes. I am sure that regardless whether OFC holds the GTG at Merlands or not, they will have sold out all their cottages with no problem. I truly hope that the member who posted about having booked into Merlands at the end of November has the time of his life... but based on what gets posted here any time a Quinte GTG is mentioned, I'm not feeling too good about all of us being in the same location... which really is a shame. HH"
501098,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-03 13:17:00,144," Fish-Fishburn, I won't get into a back and forth here as to who's wrong and who's right here, as Roy said you be the Judge. All I can tell you is that I was there last week and I stayed in Mikey Big Fish, and the experience was all positive. It's a very nice cabin located on the water close to the docks. We had some great Walleye and Bass action too. I've posted pictures below of some of the fish we caught casting crankbaits along deep weedlines, and the baits that we caught them with. I hope you have a great trip and look forward to reading your report. Cheers, Shaun        "
