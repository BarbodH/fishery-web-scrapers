500812,bucketmouthjohnny,2010-09-02 11:43:00,115,"Congrats to all competitors ,  it was a real tough weather wise day on Saturday. My fish had scattered all over the place from the previous weekend but after doing 40 minute drifts and getting 5-7 bites a drift i was able to manage a good limit both days and end up 2nd. My partners weighed in 15 plus and 13 plus as well.I nailed a double digit sheephead too!! what a fight   I have a lot of memories from this qualifier that will last my lifetime. My partners were nothing short of fantastic!! Also, have to thank my prefish partner, Sy, you found that area and than we disected it the next day, Thank you! Looking so forward to Champlain next year,  John Scholl"
