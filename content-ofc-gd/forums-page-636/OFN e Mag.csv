Great Jobs guys. I love the jig article. There were some questions on here about the jig a while back. A must read article on jig fishing for sure.   http://www.ontariofishing.net/emagazine2010/july2010-2.html

Look who is writing/contributing though...it's almost a who's who of fishing. Those of you who have not yet subscribed, do it, it's free and it'll arrive to you by email. I can also guarantee that your email addy is safe and secure and will never be passed on to anyone else.  Have a great read, subscribe."
