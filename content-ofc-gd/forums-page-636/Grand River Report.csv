Nothing to special, landed about 7 suckers, and one moon eye which actually put up a pretty good fight.  Kinda sad to see the decline in fishing in that area as only several years ago you could pull up a few nice sized bass within an hour around this time of year."
501166,Mike Pike,2010-09-03 17:21:00,1332,"I love those little Mooneyes.  They're usually willing to scrap when the Bass aren't.  I think they really tire themselves out, too, because it seems like you need to spend a bit of extra time to revive them before they take off."
501168,dave524,2010-09-03 17:36:00,4508,"love those mooneyes, great time on a light 4 wt flyrod, June seemed to be the best month for them on flys. Have to make a mental note to try them again, just haven't done it in a while. Always thought they looked like miniature tarpon"
501201,Mike Pike,2010-09-03 19:27:00,1332,I was watching 'em busting on the surface a couple of days ago while trying for bass so I switch over to a little spinner and caught a few.  They really have the look of a ocean fish like a snapper and they're so quick.  Fun on light gear.  Oh and I did see a bunch of flyfishers after 'em as well.
501218,laszlo,2010-09-03 20:16:00,487,"#1) Why mention the river your fishing on a forum with so many members?  #2) After mentioning the river, why mention the specific tiny town you were fishing it in?  I grew up in that area. The amount of guys fishing there now is crazy compared to when I was a kid. It's sad to see. So much litter along the banks and at the main parking spots."
501255,Chris 362,2010-09-03 22:44:00,14, Thanks..............................I didn't realize I had actually pin pointed the exact spot where I had been fishing in a vast river that runs through many towns and let everyone know about my excellent bounty of suckers and one moon eye...........
