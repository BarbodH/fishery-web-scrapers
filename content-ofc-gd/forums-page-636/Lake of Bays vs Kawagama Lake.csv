501065,Arcax,2010-09-03 04:29:00,5,Hello everyone  I am going to be spending the weekend near Algonquin hiking on 1 day and wanted to do some fishing around the area. I'm still a relative newbie to fishing but I have gone out much more this year (usually its just like a 1/year get-together with friends before). So I was checking out the area and saw Lake of Bays and Kawagama. I've never been to Lake of Bays or Kawagama but both seem pretty close by. I've heard Kawagama is good for lake trout but also read that trout fishing is much more involving then bass. Any thoughts on either lake and good tips?  The pics of Kawagama from various cottages and sites look pretty nice.  Thanks in advance.

501096,Arcax,2010-09-03 13:11:00,5,"Yep, we will have access to a boat. Just wondering between the 2 lakes and tips on them."

It all depends what you want to catch but I owuld fish lake of bays over Kawagama  The nearest public boatlaunch on Lake of bays from Algonguin is on Dwight beach rd.  To get to Kawagam you would have to drive about 20 -30 min longer.  Lake of bays holds both smallies and largemouth in the 5-6 lbs range as well as lake trout and last couple years they have been catching 15-25 lb pike.  Good luck  Ian"
