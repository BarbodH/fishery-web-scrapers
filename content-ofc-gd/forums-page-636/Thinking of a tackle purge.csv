500066,GBW,2010-08-31 01:27:00,8460,"Hey all.  I know headhunters thoughts on this but I want to know what the core group thins of this.  I have enough lures to choke a whale and a lot of it I don't use anymore now that I fish for walleye and not so much for bass.  Is it worth the effort to take all these pic's, review the prices of the lures and sell them or just keep them for the ""just in case I decide to fish for ... soon""?  I mean, that the soft side main bag is over 25LB's now and the other travel bags and getting up there too.  Maybe I'm thinking of this as a way to purge to get more toys like a gas auger or something else, I duno.  I have so much and I feel it's going to waste just sitting there when maybe someone else can make good use of it.  Your thoughts?  Thanks.  Geoff"
500070,Fisherpete,2010-08-31 01:31:00,1814,"My tackle purge worked out great for me! I sold off a ton of stuff that was just sitting around taking up space, and ended up using the money towards new toys. As a bonus, many of my sold lures have been catching people fish - like fishgreg's 43"" musky!!! I say GO for it!"
500072,NAW,2010-08-31 01:35:00,4022,"A little extra cash never hurts.  I'd say go for it!  If you're not going to use the stuff again for a few years, get rid of it and buy something you'll use.  A gas auger would be nice!"
500089,solopaddler,2010-08-31 02:00:00,8605,I'm a big fan of purging.
500096,tb4me,2010-08-31 02:09:00,3295,purge away my friend!! cant wait to see what u have!
500104,MCTFisher9120,2010-08-31 02:24:00,3761,Post it up for us. I don't got lot's of tackle but to buy my stuff again i would have such less stuff and only the stuff I enjoy to fish and catch fish with. Keep what you use and what you have used.
500111,Nipfisher,2010-08-31 02:39:00,2449,I am thinking the same way. I must have 10 different tackle bags and tackle boxes all full of stuff. I really only need 2-3. But if you`re purging I`ll still be looking. It think there should be a self help group for us.
500116,GBW,2010-08-31 02:55:00,8460,"Okay, time to review this weekend and decide.  If I do decide to purge some gear I will post a link to it here too (this topic).  Only on OFC of course..."
500135,lew,2010-08-31 10:43:00,12766,I stopped bass fishing a number of years ago and had a ton of good gear I no longer needed so I sold everything.  I had 5 Shimano V-rods along with Castaic & Curado reels and a bunch of tackle boxes full of lures and everything was just sitting here collecting dust.  I also sold off 4 St. Croix musky rods that I wanted to replace with Compres  Some went to friends and what was left was sold thru the OFC classifieds. Not much sense in having a bunch of stuff taking up room and not being used when someone else will appreciate buying it and saving a few $$$$ in the process.
500148,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-31 12:03:00,2690,"If it is just collecting dust, why not make it available.  I've purchased a few items on the board, and, have been very happy with the money I saved.  As I'm sure the guys I've purchased from have been happy to get some extra cash towards what they want to purchase. Go for it Geoff!!"
500156,GBW,2010-08-31 12:36:00,8460,"Okay, you talked me into it...  LOL  I will review all that I have this weekend, take pic's of batches and post.  The problem I know I will have is finding a fair price for me and the buyer...  Anyone going to be near my folks cottage (4 Mile) and want a preview this weekend?  HAHA"
500159,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-31 12:43:00,0,"I've been thinking of doing a tackle purge for quite some time. The only thing is that whenever I am way up north or on uncharterted waters, i see locals catching fish on lures that have been sitting on the bottom of my tackle box for years. I tie it on and viola, I have a new confidence lure for that lake. Not sure if that justifies hundreds of thousands of dollars in lures that just sit at the bottom of my box. Then I think some are so old they are antiques and worth something. Then I think I will pass them down to my grandchildren and maybe they could have a go. I'm sure they all work at the right place at the right time.  But then I think I can sell them and buy stuff that I know works in the lakes I usually fish. Like I said before. If we have another swill, we could bring our unwanted tackle and buy,sell or trade them."
500935,ccmtcanada,2010-09-02 18:54:00,7971,"So, what are ya gonna do with the money?? LOL.  It's not worth a tackle purge...too much work...pictures, PMs, delivery or pickup...just pick out what you dont use and I'll come take it off your hands free of charge"
500971,GBW,2010-09-02 21:46:00,8460,"we could play a game of trade-ya, you trade me some cash and I'll trade you some lures..."
501022,msp,2010-09-03 00:59:00,1336,"I say get rid of it all. the thing with fishing tackle is that there is always going to be that next ""hot"" new bait. every year you hang on to the old stuff, the more obsolete it becomes. Keep your confidence lures and expand on that. You may find that you might be holding on to somebody elses favorite lure. Its a win win situation."
501054,GBW,2010-09-03 03:06:00,8460,"See, this is why Cliff is going to pay BIG BUCKS!  Oh that and it's damn heavy to carry around while fishing...."
501239,aplumma,2010-09-03 21:26:00,6896,"I think Rick O Banion has a childrens fishing support group I have donated my old rods, reels and tackle a few years back.   Art"
501244,Terry,2010-09-03 21:37:00,14456,you can never have too many lures and if room is a problem they can be stored in my boat all year
501247,Bondar,2010-09-03 21:49:00,817,do you honestly need advice on when to sell your tackle ???  Sell it or donate it !!!
