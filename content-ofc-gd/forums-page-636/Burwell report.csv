Pulled up and went east off the sand banks 58FTW, bang right away orange harness at 45' down on the rigger lost it behind the boat. down again, not 5 Min. bang another in the net. dropped down again, bam another in the box. then my buddy started to get heat sick,   we went in. We marked a ton of fish. Talked to a few guys at the launch and they said it went dead out there, just a few guys got very few fish if any. But tomorrow is another day"
