499797,Cudz,2010-08-30 12:18:00,2652,My wife will fish with me but only with the kids too.  That makes things crazy!  3 little kids plus us in an 18' is usually nutty
499841,Spitz,2010-08-30 16:12:00,4,"Its great to have a bunch of women fishers together for a day of fishing. I have to admit, I tend to shy away from fishing with men due to their condesending attitude especially in BC here. Especially when they came out with all that PINK colored fishing gear. I wouldn't be caught dead with that stuff.  And the farther away from crowds and meat holes where you find men taking their better half as well.  Kudos to the guys who have a female partner who likes to bushwack and get off the beaten path! My husband and I travel all over just to specifically fish and we are pretty competitive against each other. We never share our fly or gear boxes, or rods and reels. That would just be sacrilege!  Plus, it was a bonus that I met my husband on a fishing forum when I was working at a fishing lodge in Terrace, BC. He was living down on Vancouver Island. So we first met face to face at the Campbell River Fishing Derby where we realized we were both hard core fishers and battled it out to win Second Place. I couldn't imagine any better first date!  I am amazed that more women don't fish on a regular basis.  Comox      Vancouver Island    Skeena Cutthroat    Queen Charlotte Islands Coho    Pallant River on QCI       Have fun!"

I don't really think she quite grasps how big a deal that is..lol. She learned how to use a baitcaster in ten minutes and still has yet to toss up a birds nest. I will take pictures if she does, though. <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I-Yn30jzUM?fs=1&hl=en_GB""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I-Yn30jzUM?fs=1&hl=en_GB""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I-Yn30jzUM?fs=1&hl=en_GB"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>"

501046,Dave Bailey,2010-09-03 02:25:00,1641,"The Gals 'n' Pals tournaments I run don't have huge turnouts, but most of the females participating are more than just along for the ride, they are regulars each year who seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing. So I say go for it."
499595,mercman,2010-08-29 21:57:00,7054,"My wife loves to fish, and she is a great fishing partner too. She asked me how many other of you fished with your wives, and how many of them are memebers of OFC. She was also wondering if there maybe enough to start a discussion group for female anglers. i personally think its a great idea, but was wondering what you all thought. but don't beat me up though"
499596,Ron,2010-08-29 21:59:00,1683,"I'm not fussy, I'll fish with anyone's wife. Just ask her! (I'm kidding!)"
499597,ckrb2007,2010-08-29 21:59:00,449, Great idea to get the old hens off our backs!!! hahaha..just kidding. My wife isn't a big fishergirl by any means but she does like getting out in the canoe or on the ice with me. She finds it very peaceful.
499598,Roy,2010-08-29 22:00:00,13728,"Sure Paul, ask her if I can be a member."
499599,Terry,2010-08-29 22:01:00,14456,"there are females on this site  and many, many of us fish with or wives or should I say get out fished by or wife but all of them agree this is the best site for discussion about fishing.............LOL"
499600,danbouck,2010-08-29 22:09:00,4380,I fish with my wife whenever we can manage.
499602,blizzcat,2010-08-29 22:12:00,92,I'm not a wife (yet. lol) but I'm a devoted fishing girlfriend
499656,splashhopper,2010-08-29 23:47:00,2931,"well,  with the tender tone u are presenting in this, I think we know WHO wears the pants in that house"
499684,OhioFisherman,2010-08-30 00:50:00,6623,"Fished with both of my ex`s, their hearts weren`t into it and they cast like girls! One hated cabins by a lake, she didn`t last long, the other caught some decent fish and provided some laughs doing it!  My 3 daughters showed more interest than my son, he would rather catch critters. Never had problems finding people to fish with, here or a road trip though, some could focus on the mission at hand better than others though.  Water and a beach and for the most part they stayed out of my way!"
499686,aplumma,2010-08-30 00:51:00,6896,My wife does not fish however she sure is glad I do.   Art
499705,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-30 01:21:00,0,"my wife doesn't fish but she will ""eat candy and read"" in the boat on a sunny day."
499706,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-30 01:24:00,602,"I fish with the wife all the time, she is a good angler"
499707,mercman,2010-08-30 01:25:00,7054,  oh bite me !!!
499711,splashhopper,2010-08-30 01:32:00,2931, Pls ask your wife it will be ok first
499714,mercman,2010-08-30 01:34:00,7054, someones gonna get a hurtin real bad  she said ok......
499720,cwpowell,2010-08-30 01:43:00,265,"My wife loves to be on the boat, with a book in her hands, she would much rather be on her sailboat, or behind the wheel of a fast boat, as for fishing, not her favourite past time, but she likes to hold the fish, and take them off the hook!"
499729,bigugli,2010-08-30 01:58:00,6138,"My mother, and my daughter love to fish. The Mrs could care less beyond one or two outings a year."
499730,Joey,2010-08-30 01:58:00,9122,"Well Paul and I are a team, and fish together every chance we get!  I wouldn't be able to stand not fishing by reading a book or tanning, it would drive me nuts.  I'd jones  As for your question about a women's forum, I don't think it would fly IMO, but then a hen party has never been my cup of tea!  No offence, just my personal preference.  Joey"
499742,mercman,2010-08-30 02:12:00,7054," thats what i say too.Barb and i make a good team. I told her she should just join up and jump right in here. From what i've seen.you're all a bunch of great people who show respect for one another,and don't laff at newbies and our questions."
499744,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-30 02:15:00,2690,"Fish with Juli all the time.  She loves to fish, be it in the boat, on the ice on the river...so yeah, I'm pretty lucky.  She isn't a member of the board, but, sees many posts on here through me."
499747,bigugli,2010-08-30 02:17:00,6138,Hey splashopper. Perhaps we should get the opinion of the real fisherperson in your family; that wonderful daughter of yours.
499781,Duckie,2010-08-30 11:08:00,305,St. Croix has a whole line of new pink pearl coloured quality bass rods marketed specifically for women.  just sayin' folks..when christmas and birthdays etc come around...its another idea.
499788,splashhopper,2010-08-30 11:32:00,2931," lol bigugli..... i think i reacted to this thread this way because my daughter hasn't had a single weekend off this summer, due to her sports and summer fun stuff, yet to go fishing with me.  I hope we can get her another one of these as soon as she gets back from Florida,Manhattan and then Montreal over the next 12 days or so before school.  "
499789,splashhopper,2010-08-30 11:33:00,2931, yep... SHE confirmed it!
499791,fisherman7,2010-08-30 11:43:00,325,My wife fishes with me a fair bit. She's good company but doesn't like it when she doesn't catch anything. So sometimes we'll go to some weed beds and catch rock bass and sunfish. Makes her happy!
