501497,vinnimon,2010-09-05 02:24:00,2593,"I had an awesome day today!A little tired now, but it was well worth it! Ryan, my youngest,was happy as can be for her new night gown and lures! Thanks Ryan(and wifie) for welcoming all of us to your home  BTW,the spread was awesome!Why wasnt there any fish on a platter to be served?Being that we are all fisherman/fishergals! HMMMM!"
501511,ctdd2006,2010-09-05 03:56:00,531,Awesome stuff!!!  Congrats to all!
501517,skinny,2010-09-05 11:47:00,442,It was a fun day for a great cause.I would like to thank Ryan and his Family along with all those who helped make this day work out. Fishing was slow but still managed a 15.5 inch bass (pic is comming).  Sign me up for next year
501537,fishnsled,2010-09-05 14:19:00,3520,Great numbers Ryan!!!  Looking forward to the full report.  Congrats on yet another successfull Fish-A-Thon!!
501203,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-03 19:31:00,2690," Thanks!!!!  The fish caught will just be a bonus, looking forward to meeting a bunch of board members...although with Rick and Vince's wager, I'm going to do my best to catch a good one!!"
501252,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-03 22:06:00,2050,"ALRIGHT! I'm officially in Fish-A-Thon mode for the next 28 hours or so.  We've got a bunch more prizes which I'll post shortly, and I'll include a few other things to go over for you guys!  So far the pledges are flooding in all around, and we're shaping up to have an awesome day.  We just have to cross our fingers for decent weather!  I just have to run out and get some tables and chairs and a second BBQ then I'll get back to you guys with a bunch of details!  Please stay tuned!  Cheers, Ryan"
501306,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-04 01:06:00,2690,"Any details, yet, Ryan?  We are pretty much loaded up and ready to go for tomorrow."
501307,Leecher,2010-09-04 01:10:00,7832,Good luck to all the participants tomorrow Sounds like it's going to be an awesome time Tight lines Leechman
501309,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-04 01:11:00,2050,Typing some things out as we speak!
501314,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-04 01:30:00,2050,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet as I still have to pack up my boat and such!  Time:  Our sort of official start is 8 a.m. but you don't have to kill yourself and get there for 7 or anything... arriving at 8 is OK!  We'll spend a few minutes meeting one another, getting our shirts, launching boats and so on!  The park is charging the standard $10 fee per vehicle, but they likely won't be there when we arrive so just come on in and head down to wards the launch.  We're going to have a Big Fish prize, and I'll go over those details in the morning, but remember to BRING A CAMERA!  We're giving everybody measuring tapes (special thanks to T.J. and Ontariofishing.net for them! )  I'm hoping to set up a spot to meet for lunch and talk about what's working and what isn't.   Then we'll go back to fishing until the BBQ and prize part of the day!  In the event that it's raining on and off which is a definite possibility I'm going to set something up at the conservation area where people can come in and warm up and or dry off.  If this does happen, the BBQ and Prizes will likely happen at the park rather than my place because they have a covered pavilion.  Weather permitting, we'll stop fishing with just enough time to get all the boats out and head over to my place for the post fish-a-thon festivities!  I'm going to have everything from burgers and hot dogs, to salads and fruit trays so you don't want to miss out on the BBQ part of the day!  Things to remember:  1) Sun Screen 2) water 3) snacks 4) Lunch 5) Rain Coats 6) cell phone if you have one 7) CAMERA 8) a pee bucket! haha   they have out-houses at the park 9) bathing suits in case it happens to be warm enough 10) your pledge forms and money 11) towels 12) what am I missing?? fill in the blanks for me guys!  I'm going to try to be on the water for 5 a.m. myself as I'd like to see what they're eating and figure out the most sheltered parts of the lake in the event that it's windy....  Remember, the temperature will have dropped significantly in a short amount of time, so the fish are going to be slow moving and a little more tight lipped.  Small and Slow baits SHOULD be the ticket like Shawn said, but we'll try to figure them out!  Fire off any questions you have!  Can't wait t'il morning!  Cheers, RYan"
501320,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-04 01:47:00,2690,"Sounds, excellent...don't forget your licenses and operator cards as well.  We will see you in the morning...probably around 7:30 or so.  Get some sleep, dude, if you are hitting the water at 5!!!!!!!!"
501323,vinnimon,2010-09-04 02:02:00,2593,"Does it get choppy?Im going to have both my girls in the swamp fox! This will be interesting! Im sure they will have a great time as will I! BTW Frank,Ive got ten bucks riding on you! Honest!"
501324,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-04 02:04:00,2050," No worries buddy, we'd have to be in a hurricane to get white caps on that lake! haha  even if it was really windy there's a whole bunch of little sheltered fingers off the sides of hte lake to go fish... I'll go over some maps with you guys in the morning...  cheers, Ryan"
501326,vinnimon,2010-09-04 02:08:00,2593,  Would it be advisible to bring a tent?Just in case!
501327,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-04 02:12:00,2050,if you want to and have room for it ya might as well throw it in the car!
501330,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-04 02:29:00,2050,"Special thanks to a few more sponsors!  We'll get all of our amazing prize donators and sponsors posted up on our final Fish-A-Thon Thread, but for now here's a few that came in this afternoon....

501486,justwannafish,2010-09-05 01:45:00,82,"Well if all I have to show for a day on the water is a 10.5"" rock bass and $4500 raised for cancer I would say that it was a very successful day!! Good job everyone! Can't wait till next year (and maybe nicer weather?) Later!"
500463,Rich,2010-09-01 10:59:00,3927,"FYI, you might want to call ahead. Sleded's shirt size is ""tarp"".. they might not make them that big?"
500464,danbouck,2010-09-01 11:00:00,4380," Ryan is away until Friday, let me know if you need anything"
500472,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-01 12:17:00,2690,Another $100 pledge from Juli's mom!!!  Thanks Judi
500545,tb4me,2010-09-01 15:57:00,3295,Ok quick question for you Dan...Having never been to this lake what is the launch like there? Im wondering if we should be there an hour or so early to get launched? were bringing a 12 ft tinny so if its real busy we could just toss it in anywhere. what are your thoughts on this? Do we start at 8 am sharp?
500548,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-01 16:09:00,2690," I can give you a decent answer on that one...the launch isn't usually that busy.  Remember there are no gas motors allowed on the lake, so it cuts down on boat traffic considerably.  There is a decent grade heading down to the lake, but, you could walk a 12 fter in fairly easily. Looks like we are going to have quite the cold front rolling through, so, super-slow presentations this weekend. I'll let Dan or Ryan help out more with the time...I'm not sure what time the gatehouse will be open."
500551,danbouck,2010-09-01 16:20:00,4380,Not sure exactly what time we are starting at but the ramp will not be busy. We will probably be the only ones launching at that time. I will be there probably an hour early getting things ready to go.
500552,danbouck,2010-09-01 16:21:00,4380,How's there pledges coming? I'm over $300 now
500554,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-01 16:24:00,2690," Nice, Dan!!  I'm at about $200...Juli is up to close to $400, I think, with a few more people to pledge (she's smoking me!!!!!)"
500567,danbouck,2010-09-01 16:51:00,4380, NICE
500673,Handlebarz,2010-09-01 22:53:00,3790,Great Job everyone its nice to see so many helping out cant wait for the pics and stories next week

500681,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-01 23:24:00,2050,"Hey guys!!! I just got off the water after a tough day at the office... Haha I'm on my phone so I'll keep this short and get back to you all on Friday when I'm home.  Our start time is 8 am for those who can make it there on time.  I'm thinking it'll likely take us a good half hour or so to get everyone launched.  I'm going to try to be there for around 6:30 so I can help get organized.  The news paper is goin to be there shortly after 8 for a picture of the group and to ask a few questions for their write up.  I'll get y'all all the info you need on Friday!  The park is charging us 10 bucks per vehicle.... The gates are open all night and we can pay on out way out..  Keep up the awesome work!  Thanks again for everything!  Cheers, Ryan"

Tell you and Rick what...if she catches a bigger fish than me, I will add another $20 out of my pocket to the pledges...that way there is another $20 regardless of who gets a bigger fish!!"
501010,danbouck,2010-09-03 00:22:00,4380,        Well I am speechless with the generosity from all the supporters of this event. Luremaking.com sent the package to me today and I picked up a massive box of spoons from Knock Out Lures today.  Thanks to everyone!

Our family is looking forward to participating, and, things have hit close to home with us yesterday.  On the way back from Restoule, Juli's eldest boy got a text saying that her other son's, Ceagan, good friend and classmate Jacob (of Jacob's story) had passed away after his battle with Leukemia.  We had just stopped for lunch in South River, and, the boys were pretty upset, but, we concentrated on how strong a little boy Jacob was.  Keep up the great work guys/gals!!!"

496757,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-21 16:13:00,1107,Tb4me I think that's how we did it last year but it was a tough day of fishing I think we should go by inches and everyone bring a tape measure and camera so if any big hawgs get caught they don't get stressed out and can be released right away some of those big bass are really old and it would be a shame to lose 1.   Hey Ryan cindy and dean Franklin from the TBBA have commited to donating some stuff for prizes that I will pick up next sunday also angling outfitters in woodstock has also commited to a prize pack I will let ya know what exactly both are next monday at the latest still waiting on a couple other places to get back to me this week I will keep ya updated.

496468,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 15:32:00,2050,"Okay hopefully I've gotten some attention from my ""HELP"" title.   Things are going to happen much more fast and furious than I had hopped or planned.  We are going to go with September 4th as our date, which means short notice and only 2 weeks to get pledges and prizes organized.  Why so last minute on my end?  To much on the go in my life right now which I don't really want to jump the gun on talking about, but the last thing I want to see happen is for the fish-a-thon to get passed up on it's second year.  We've gotten some AWESOME prize donations to date, but are much farther behind on pledges at this time, so if you're able to make a prize donation or pledge of ANY KIND, please shoot me a PM and we'll set something up.  Pledger's will have their name put into a draw for a real nice prize!  Here's the deal:  Date: September 4th 2010  Location: Deer Creek Conservation Area  Times: 8 a.m. until 5 P.m. (for those who can make the entire day)  BBQ: 5:30 We'll have a BBQ, Bonfire and Prizes ( you can bring your family and or kids as we'll have a Kids Bouncy Castle set up as well )  Prizes: There will be various prizes for Fish-A-Thon participants as well as a chance for Pledgers to win something nice.  We have to wait until later in the week to decide what exactly will be given out for what and who, as we're still getting donations at this time.  Fish-A-Thon participants: Need to get a pledge form from me or Dan ASAP and we'll need your T-Shirt Size.  Get as many pledges as possible, and also try to get friends or family members involved.  I will be on the lake the next two weeks so I'll try to zero in on some fish and figure out some patters to help get everybody into some decent catches.  We'll have a tournament style day again with a chance at a prize.  The later date might make the bass bite a little tougher, but the trout bite will pick up for sure with cooler temps.  Lastly I started a new thread in hopes that it get's a little more love and attention if I just keep bumping it up...  Here's some catches from Deer Creek.  Most of the time you can't get into the lake with motors on your boats so this is an opportunity for you guys to fish a great little lake no matter the size of your vessel!                                  Last Years Prizes and Winners:           The Gang:        The Lake:          And the woman who caused me to start this Fish-A-Thon.  Irene Anderson who passed away shortly after last years event from Cancer.      "

496529,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 17:26:00,2050," Entry to the park is usually $10.00 but I'm trying to get them to wave that fee or at least discount it.  As for the fish-a-thon there's no ""entry fee"" other than to try and get some pledges with your pledge form.  Just like a walk-a-thon if you've ever participated in one or made a donation.  The lake is about 25 minutes southeast of Tillsonburg, Ontario towards Long point.  And I'll see what we can do about getting you on the water!  Cheers, Ryan"
496561,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-20 18:22:00,0,Wow! Some decent bass and nice trout! Is there any rentals in that lake? Hope the fish a thon is a success!
496563,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-20 18:26:00,2690,Canoe rentals only...electric motors only on other boats.
496564,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-20 18:29:00,2050,"  Yeah like Frankie said, only canoe rentals, and aside from my fish-a-thon you're not allowed any gas motors on the lake. Not even trimmed up...."
