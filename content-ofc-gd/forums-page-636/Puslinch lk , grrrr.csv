I spoke to a co worker today,he is very good freinds with the owners of the ski instructors(i wont mention names) and he has donated to the fish a thon as well! He is a ski instructor as well there! I approached him and ask what the pro blem was with fisherman and them! Well, the problem lies with the  that dont respect private property and what this school has to offer.People are paying good dollars and I understand that.As for the fisherman, like us, some have abused what they offer(boat ramp and access).  I had a good chat about this with my co worker,Some people(fisherman) are tying off to bouys,anchoing off on some of their runs(there are three of them).Leaving junk around esp when ice fishing is in season! He has donated to the fish a thon before I approached him about this issue! He has also apologized to me personally, about my discomforts in a canoe and to my group,US,OFC community.  So an official apology has been made to me and my group(OFC)by the instuctor at Mcclintocks!Keep it clean and respect each others space! Im glad that I brought it up and so was he! And if your hungry theres a great restaurant next door! I used to fish while waitng for my order,a little tip went a long way Im glad I brought it up,all ends well for us respectful fisher guys and gals!"

501009,vinnimon,2010-09-03 00:21:00,2593," True, we all are somehow guilty of something or other!As they are the only access as well as lakeside restaurant to the lake,a little respect can go a long way!"
