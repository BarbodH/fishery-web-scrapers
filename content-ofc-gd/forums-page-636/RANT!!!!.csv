500639,Tybo,2010-09-01 21:17:00,1373,There is a reason I don't own fire arms.Today was one of those reasons. The next I live my life in A/C person come up to me and ask if it's hot enough. I'm going to lose it.IF you think this is polite when a man is kneeling on a 14l Engine sweating hard enough to produce steam to come up from the engine. it is not.Or is it just a sick joke. This isn't just me that I've seen going over the top with this more then obvious. So do use a favour in passing. If you have nothing to say a wave will be just fine.  Thanks Paul  P.S. This goes for the cold to.

500650,GBW,2010-09-01 21:46:00,8460,"most people say things like that to you Paul because they don't have a clue what to say and they feel it's a conversation starter.  me on the other hand, I would say ""is your a/c broke, cause it's hotter the hell in here"" and give you a   grin... on the bright side, I don't have to sit with you on the GO train..."
