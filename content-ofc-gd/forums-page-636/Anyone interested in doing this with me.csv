500432,fishhunter,2010-09-01 03:57:00,604,"If your looking for a couple others try sending a pm to Jose , FRANKIE65 , Daking_eh2007 just to name a few that have gone out with me before that may want in."
500486,markiemark70,2010-09-01 12:57:00,158,"OK thanks for the tip. One question though, after posting my message about the charter I looked at some of the pics on your site. Do I need a full survival suit to withstand the cold? I didn't take the cold into account. I dont have any real winter fishing clothes. I could at best wear heavy winter street clothes.  Please advise. I am not really in a postition to go out and buy a bunch of winter gear, so if that is a neccesity I would probably not be able to go.  Thanks"
500562,johnnyb,2010-09-01 16:41:00,3413,"Now I 've heard tell, that if...just if... you behave yourself, Lloyd might let you have a nap up in the cozy cabin between fish"
500573,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-01 17:25:00,2690," Ask him what the ""in-flight"" movie is as well, lol!!!  Good luck, if you do make it out, Mark."
500596,fishhunter,2010-09-01 18:22:00,604,you guys are to funny lol so your answer to your question is you dont need a float suit. the boat is fully covered and when you get on the boat in the morning you will find it at 75 for a nice warm ride out. plus the dates that i have open for that price are in oct and its still warm out. If you want a inflight movie pm me and ill make sure the dvd is ready for your movie while you fish.
500597,Terry,2010-09-01 18:29:00,14456,while watching the movie can one of the massage girls work on me..........
500610,Roy,2010-09-01 19:01:00,13728," Be careful Terry, Jose is working the Saturday & Sunday day shifts in October this year."
500695,I'mHooked,2010-09-02 00:10:00,525,"Hey Mark, I may be able to swing it.  I just sent Lloyd a pm as well. I can't do the 10th. The 17th looks pretty good for me (and possibly 1 additional person).  Inquired what the 3rd date option may be that he refers to. (Mentions 3 days, with 2 dates listed)."
500715,markiemark70,2010-09-02 01:04:00,158,Ok I'm flexible on the date so let me know. Thanks.
500873,I'mHooked,2010-09-02 14:58:00,525," I'm in for the 17th. PM sent.  May have another interested, although not confirmed."
501165,I'mHooked,2010-09-03 17:11:00,525,Well there's 2 of us so far.  Who else is interested?
501311,markiemark70,2010-09-04 01:21:00,158,"OK so instead of everyone PM'ing, which is making my head hurt (never claimed to be a genius), here is the status:  Me and I'm hooked are in for the 17th Cowanjo is in for one of the dates or both not sure which  Lloyd said the 17th may be gone.  So I am in for either the 10th or the 17th, but want at least 3 people making it $141 each.  Inhookes and Cowanjo, let me know if you are both in for the 17th and we can book that date right away. Since Lloyd hasn;t said that it is gone maybe we can still get it.  Also we need to work out some way to get the money on the table so that there is no last minute changes. Any suggestions?"
501372,fishhunter,2010-09-04 12:24:00,604,I'll give you till 6pm today to lock in the 17th or another group wants it leaving only the 10th open for that deal
501402,markiemark70,2010-09-04 16:00:00,158,"OK lloyd, we have 2 for sure just waiting to hear back from a thirs that I just called (cowanjo) to see if he is good for that date.  Is there a way that you can take money on a cc from each of us?"
501423,markiemark70,2010-09-04 19:37:00,158,Ok so It looks like we are good to go for the 17th. Based on my conversation with imhooked he is definitely in for the 17th and we can try to get more people later.  See you on the 17th lloyd and thanks.
501514,e-z-out,2010-09-05 06:00:00,1052,  LOL good one Roy Yes i'll be working that day Terry i can fit you in if you don't mind waiting lol   So do you guys need one more member? If so count me in.  Sunday 17th 2010 is that right?
