500599,Fishing 24/7,2010-09-01 18:36:00,709,I used to fish form shore.  bay noire..... bridge..... yep i used to get BEAST'S  so i planned on hitting it in my boat with sly.  The wild rice produced about a dozen fish.  No big size tho.    sly's first fish on the Buzz.  And this was the big fish of the day.  a 3 lbs plus i dont remmember.  actualy i dont want to remmember anything about that day.  was in the middle of a tourney bass boats everywhere .    After that outting ... it was the first time i went bass fishing and left with out a sand paper finger. :shock:  PAY BACK TIME  i wont go down without a FIGHT.  The largies Lost yesterday.  We get the the lake a 3 pm.  Strat the slop.    I land one on the frog.  SWEET! but since i starting to flip..... frogs well.... i just dont use them anymore.  so this will be the only one of the day on the toads.  Start flipping the rice............ NOTHING.  Im like !  :shock:  This cant be.  Grab my buzzbait rod.  start to work the BACK of the rice... in the TIGHT rice... BOOM!  a PIG hits.... he is comming towards the boat... he jumps.... a fair 3 lbs +  i MISS him..........  MAD.....  i continue.....BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ BANG!!!  SWEET HIS DAD HITS ME!    19 '' 4.5 lbs .  and this one was a BLAST to land.  i saw a Wake come from about 10 ' from the deep rice and absolutly SMASH the Buzz man.  RIGHT THERE thats pure bass fishing I.M.O.  Then we were off to the islands.  Flip style....SO FUN im addicted.  Its always fun to try new stuff so today.    These were on the list.  LOVED them.  Black and bleu.....how can they resist?  They cant !!!    Now these islands have ALWAYS produced BIG fish but today....  It was a 4 lbs frenzy or something.        Had a chance to REALY try my 7 ' kistler jig and toad.  and feel what its like to pull in a brute from 10 FOW and flip him right in the live well.  TWAS FUN!  :mrgreen:  Now sly is stuck on senko's these days.  cant blame the guy they work all the time.    He was happy with this pair...  As the islands die down.  i has a plan.  2 '' of water style.  water temp. 80 FREECKING 5 degree..... activity level to the MAX.    When bass are hitting on the buzz.....and the water is like a mirror.....  only one word comes to mind... FUNNNNNNNNNN    SLY lands these two brutes back to back.  and setting his new P.B. top 4.2 lbs  SWEEETT!    yes 19 ''    A LA Justing Hoffman Style  As the sun was setting.  i knew one thing.  The Largies will be in the rocks. feeding on crayfish.  well.  i was right.    Two 3 lbs + hit at the same time.  double header.  he grabs both and makes a sweet picture.  sun is gone.......almost...    bass are still in...... SHALLOW.  made for a fun after work outting.  for the first time.....  NOTHING under 3 lbs was caught.  one of the best outting i had in a long time.......
