499042,bassnass,2010-08-27 14:39:00,174,Hello All!  I'm hopin to fish Silent lake (bass & lakers) and Cedar lake (Musky) in the near future.  Does anyone have any info.  I'm especially looking for hydrographic (depth) charts/maps of those bodies of water.  Any help would be appreciated.  FYI - I'm almost alway a catch & release guy... unless I catch a pan-sized laker.  He'd come home for a visit.  Cheers!

499153,Garry2Rs,2010-08-27 20:35:00,1425,"  If you are talking about the lakes along #28 near Apsley, forget about Big Cedar.  There are too many fish eaters on that lake.  The Musky population has disappeared.  I can't help you with Silent Lake PP it's a motor-less lake so I have never been there. Garry2R's"

500919,bassnass,2010-09-02 18:10:00,174,A lil update - stayed at Silent Lake PP - they had a ROUGH chart of the lake - enough to put me on a couple of nice lakers one day.  Then I went and slayed Largies the next.  Not bad for canoe fishin'!
