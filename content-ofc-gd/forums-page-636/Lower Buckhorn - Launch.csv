501194,bassmasta,2010-09-03 19:14:00,27,Anybody have any tips for the Lower Buckhorn?  It'll be my first time there and I'm hoping to get in some Bass and Muskie fishing.  Where are the good launch points for me and my bass boat   Thanks in advance

501202,lew,2010-09-03 19:29:00,12766,Just be careful as the waters north of the channel are shallow & rocky.  Very pretty lake with excellent fishing.
501205,bassmasta,2010-09-03 19:38:00,27,  North of the channel? Anyway you can give me some GPS coordinates to avoid or approach with Caution?
501207,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-03 19:42:00,144,"Lew's right, it's a beautiful little lake. Below are some liks to videos from segments Musky and Bass episodes that we shot on Lower Buckhorn. Hope they help.  There is another ramp that I often use located at Beachwood Resort in Deer Bay. You'll find details on places to launch in the vids too.

501212,lew,2010-09-03 19:50:00,12766," The lake runs east - west bassmasta as does the boating channel. No GPS numbers for you, just be more careful on the northern 1/2 of the lake and watch for the shoals. Lotsa good islands to fish around and as Dax suggested, there's some nice muskies in those areas, although very few of the larger ones.  Some shallow sections on the lower half as well but not as bad and there's also nice weeds along the southern shore too.  Best of luck to ya !!"
