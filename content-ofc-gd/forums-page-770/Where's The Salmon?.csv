I havent really went much salmon fishing so my knowledge towards this lacks.I was at bronte the beggining of Oct but it was packed with people so i didnt get to fish much any info would be great thank you."
398158,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-31 18:19:00,1107,there pretty much done (salmon) but just about any river that had salmon in it will have trout (brown and bows)with the rainbows staying in till around june check the regulations and get a map you will find them and theres nothing better than catching a bunch of chromers from a spot you found and picked yourself.

Thats because no one else bothers to go as far up as i do!.... which is where a pond lays... anyways ya salmon are pretty well over, however there are the odd zombies and i'll get out for some chrome eventually.....
