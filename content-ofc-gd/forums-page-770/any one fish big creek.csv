397253,Jeff Wiles,2009-10-29 00:48:00,55,I was thinking of taking my boy up there Saturday any one know how the water is or if there is any fish around.  Jeff
397263,timmeh,2009-10-29 01:15:00,609,If you're interested in water levels check out this link;  http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp  Best bet is to go out and give it a try. And talk to any other anglers you may see out there. Most people are more comfortable sharing info to people they meet on the river as opposed to on the net.  Good luck
397387,skinny,2009-10-29 11:38:00,442,I havn't been out but I stopped at the local tackle shop the other day and he said theat people had been pulling out a bunch of trout  if i don't get alot of home work for the weekend (returning to college sucks in some ways) I might be out. It will be new to me I havn't done the river thing.

397751,skinny,2009-10-30 09:37:00,442,think it's called fish on bait and tackle . if you head out of delhi on brant road (#4) he is just up from the corner and is in the back of the craft shop. the owner is a nice guy helps you out if you have questions
