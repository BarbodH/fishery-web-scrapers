398169,Dara,2009-10-31 19:28:00,3052,"  We didn't ask them to borrow it. We asked them to try and do something about the recession. They use that as a blank cheque to get all their pet projects through and leave us with a massive debt. I still don't understand how we sold off all of our power generation facilities and we are still paying for them. Not only that, we are paying to build more capacity for private enterprise to own. Poor planning on our governments part has killed Ontario's manufacturing sector. This property reassesment is a scam too. My property taxes are going up 20% and I have to pay to have the city haul my neighbors leaves away."
398216,scuro2,2009-10-31 22:36:00,904,"Ah I get it now. This is propaganda. Never took the time to look at the original post. It comes from  the National Citizens Coalition. This is a Libertarian lobby group. At the link provided you can't use there handy-dandy HST calculator unless you given them your e-mail. Memberships must be slipping.  Libertarian - think Ron Paul. Libertarians don't want any government and don't want to pay any tax. That goal goes to extremes, if your are blind or crippled from birth, well that is your problem....don't be looking for no government help. The NCC have been fighting the Canadian Health act for four decades, it irks them to no end that their membership, fat old white bald dudes, have to pay into a general pot that may include immigrants."
398223,albany_guide,2009-10-31 23:24:00,23, Like what?  Give every unemployed person a hug and tell them it will be alright?  Tell me what you would have done about the recession without spending any money.
398225,PAZE,2009-10-31 23:48:00,132,"Ummm do you acutually believe our defacit will be paid of anytime??? LOL look at the states they put us to shame the amount they owe and it just keeps getting bigger, Let me know when ours goes down, even 1 dollar I want to see it, it just keeps getting bigger."
398245,Jonny,2009-11-01 01:51:00,1380," Your Prime Minister once headed this group. At least here's someone trying to do something about the high taxes that I see many moaning about (but resigned to!).  I don't belong, but you could do worse."
398261,scuro2,2009-11-01 03:15:00,904,"Yes he did. Harper is now considered a traitor by this crew. I've got no problem with a government trying to reducing high taxes. What I have a problem with is agenda driven propaganda being passed off as discontent with government. The HST is actually supposed to be good for business in that it doesn't tax business for incidentals, and levels the playing field for Canadian business in the world market. How come we didn't hear a stitch about that from any of the posters here or on the website? You would think Libertarians would trumpet less tax for business. Propaganda has no interest in balance."
398263,rickster,2009-11-01 03:19:00,495,can someone please explain to me what disposable income is?????????????????    is it what happens after I buy a few beer?
398264,irishfield,2009-11-01 03:21:00,26272,No Rickster... those are disposable brain cells....
398265,rickster,2009-11-01 03:25:00,495,LOL....good thing they are disposable
398267,Dara,2009-11-01 03:39:00,3052,  Just the weak ones die off from alcohol..the strong ones survive. Think of it as a cleansing.   And I'm done arguing ploitics...it just gets me angry.
398295,pikehunter,2009-11-01 12:20:00,1659," EXACTLY what I was thinking! Ever since I read the first reply that referred to this being due to the recession. Come on people think back and remember, this was supposed to happen years ago when the GST came into effect and it is what the federal government desired then, and what Prime Minister was in power then? Yep the one we all love to hate MULRONEY!  This was planned long ago but no one brought it into effect till now and it is a day that those in a business that does not have to charge PST now is regretting. I can remember before GST and after how our business took a hit and when did the GST come in? Yep during a recession.  carp all we want the politicians will do as they please."
398305,Canuck2fan,2009-11-01 13:55:00,1444,"WOW I just can't believe everyone on here having an opinion based solely on their political leaning. The facts are very simple with respect to the HST. The push to have it is coming from Ottawa not Queens Park in Ontario. Harper and Flarherty want it and have told Dalton do it if you EVER want to see your fair share of funds from Ottawa...... When Dalton went and stood up for Ontario and begged to get a fair shake he was told if you want it you have to implement the HST.  So would you as Premiere continue to accept the status quo where Ontario with only 35% of the population gets hit with 50% of the costs of federal programs? Or would you take the massive injection of funds that Harper has promised you if you implement the HST?  Also to whoever said that Dalton is bribing us taxpayers really proved they have absolutely no grasp of the situation. The ""bribe"" money you are talking about is coming from Harper!!!!!! At least Dalton has promised to pass some it back to us, so the cheque will say it was from Dalton and he will take the blame politically but it was Harper that is giving him the money to do it."
398310,jaydub,2009-11-01 14:07:00,145, I'm gonna step out on a limb and say....Liberal??? lol.
398311,Cookslav,2009-11-01 14:13:00,1457," Wow, I didn't think there were any left!"
398322,scuro2,2009-11-01 14:59:00,904,Yeah call me a liberal for being the only one to state that the HST is good for business and that this is the purpose of harmonizing the tax.  You guys kill me with your keen deductive reasoning abilities!!
398330,ch312,2009-11-01 15:19:00,1590,"thats right people keep on voting in the LIEberals...they are taking us in the right direction  its not hard to see why so many people like to go on EI, welfare, etc and work for cash..."
398341,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-11-01 16:21:00,0," Bingo! The name of the game is to redirect tax payers dollars to the coffers of the people that helped pay their campiagn. And then leave the tax payer with the bill.  And yes, the conservative government is to blame(Free Trade) for selling us off the the states. And importing thousands of immigrants for cheap labour. But what happens when trade slows down between the US and Canada? Unstable employement. So yes. This economic crisis is the fault of the conservatives. Its all about exploiting the poor and increasing profit margins. For those people that support Free trade? Wait until China steals all your jobs.  Too bad the flu thread was closed. I still had things to say to the know it alls."
398343,Andy,2009-11-01 16:35:00,330,"""A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have."" A quote from another fishing site, apparently made by Gerald Ford. A lot of truth to it. Special interest group squealing for money, everybody a victim needing compensation for perceived wrongs, people who haven't, or can't be bothered, making a meaningful contribution to our society or culture always demanding more in exchange for nothing (ever notice how many people without a pot to urinate in seem to always have a cell phone, a pack of smokes, and a case of beer?), people who believe their rights are more important than the rights of others, along with governments who seem afraid to say ""no"", make for big, expensive government that has an impact on every aspect of our lives."
398345,mbosh1980,2009-11-01 16:54:00,349,"The global recession is the fault of the 1994 conservative government?  Heck, I'm not even mad; that's amazing."
398347,Jonny,2009-11-01 16:58:00,1380," Oh my Good Lord! Dalton McGuinty...... our hero!  Look, the bottom line is that the HST is going to cost each consumer hundreds if not thousands more in taxes every year. I don't care what the rationale is from some people re: how it's going to be good for us, I think it's just plain dumb to think that the solutions to our problems ALWAYS involve us ""little guys"" paying MORE taxes."
398356,scuro2,2009-11-01 17:47:00,904,"Does anyone actually read real news on this forum?  Everyone knows exactly what the HST is about except that no one here knows what it is about. This is really more about taking two taxes and turning it into one tax that covers the same stuff.  This is a tax that is good for business, it streamlines things and save the government money, and as far as I can see is not going to cost the average consumer thousands and thousands of dollars, but instead...as I understand it, is to be revenue neutral overall. If someone wants to state that the tax is the first step of the United nations enslaving all Canadians, or a way for liberals to simply line their pockets....well then I say make that connection using a reliable source. Otherwise it's just a bunch of blowhards grumping about a tax they don't understand and connecting that to whatever bothers them."
398369,keram,2009-11-01 19:55:00,585,  If your knowledge about HST and understanding it is represented by the sentence in bold/italic (quote from your post) you deserve to pay HST X 2.
398371,Jonny,2009-11-01 20:09:00,1380, That's way too simplistic and inaccurate.
398372,Dara,2009-11-01 20:16:00,3052,"  I don't really have a problem with HST coming in. What I have a problem with is the huge increase in taxes because of it.  The that crook McGuinty wanted to be fair at all, it would be coming in at something like 5 and 5 to make it 10, not 5 and 8. They are taking way more tax dollars in and we will see no increase in services for it. It will go to political pet projects for re election. And you know it won't stay at 13, it will grow, anf there will be nobody to blame when it does because the feds and provincials weill just point and say, it wasn't me that raised it, it was them."
398373,Dara,2009-11-01 20:18:00,3052,  I didn't notice that at first...you now rate a great bug DUH from me
397843,Jonny,2009-10-30 17:28:00,1380,"The proposed Harmonized Sales Tax for Ontario is going to hurt big time. We're all going to lose disposable income to spend on ""frills"" like fishing and hunting.  I found a link to the National Citizens Coalition today and went there to try their HST Calculator. I added just a few variables (gas, electricity, heating and internet) and the attachment shows what I came up with.  It's not too late to make the government nervous about getting re-elected. Make some noise wherever you can!  http://nationalcitizens.ca/index.html  Don't just sit there and get shorn! "
397844,mbosh1980,2009-10-30 17:42:00,349,"agreed.  my condo fees alone are set to go up 12-14%.  Not sure why it is so imperative that this is introduced right now, just as the economy is beginning to recover."
397870,TC1OZ,2009-10-30 19:39:00,987,I don't even know why I go to work any more....I'll get more tax breaks on unemployment...
397872,irishfield,2009-10-30 19:42:00,26272,Yep... that is part of the problem in our fine country... many have learned that they can live comfortably just staying at home and waiting for the welfare/mother's allowance/poggy cheques to appear thru the door. Why exert yourself if you don't need to...  We use to joke that it was the worst hereditary disease in Smiths Falls..
397887,albany_guide,2009-10-30 20:05:00,23," Did you think the 80 billion dollars the federal and provincial governments collectively borrowed to 'stabilize' our economy would magically pay itself back?  Tax increases and higher interest rates are a given.  For those proposing to fight the HST, how exactly do you propose we pay that money back?  Get used to it!  Tax increases are in the future.  Bet on it!  I see the tax free sales of principal residences being next on the chopping block.  Welcome to the new normal."
397892,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-30 20:18:00,2582, Sad...but true.  I've said it before and I'll say it again. Taxes are a necessary evil. Does anyone REALLY think the government is just taking the money to screw people?..REALLY?  I'm not trying to start a pissing match. Just saying it's necessary and anybody who is an adult  Canadian should have realized a long time ago that this is the way things are in Canada.  Suck it up or move.
397897,LeXXington,2009-10-30 21:00:00,1928,"HST, can't stop it why try.  First they said its coming nothing can stop it, the wrote the rules so you can't change it even after a couple years.  The ran up 22 billion in debt -- got too pay that off.  Ok that being said what can you do..  Stop wasting money!! on pay rasies for goverment employee's that make too much SUNSHINE LIST ring a bell. Stop stupid projects, Wasted a billion on a software program with nothing to show for it. Start firing people at the top make not the workers s at the bottom Do more with less. There is no need to fire anyone worker, just stop hiring more  When the debt is paid off do you really think they will give it back to the people the took it from. NO they will just find some other way to pibble it away then take more.  I understand taxes are needed to run a country BUT since when does my taxes need to fund a stupid ass STUFF  Vote, Vote, Vote,  TAX REVOLT is coming"

397904,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-30 21:28:00,2582,  LOL... and I do mean LOL.
397910,scuro2,2009-10-30 21:37:00,904,"That's why I like coming to OFC, you can be certain of a one sidedness on political issues that looks and smells like propaganda. What I read in the posts above has nothing to do with the rational of the government.  http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/taxchange/faq.html#q6"
397941,Jonny,2009-10-30 23:55:00,1380,"Wow, this ""I can't do anything"" attitude that I see in some of the posts here is discouraging but not entirely unexpected. After all, that's the kind of thing our governments bank on --- apathy.  From the Ont. gov. site :   A 1% tax reduction (6.05% to 5.05%) would result in a savings of $368, $110 less than the increased cost illustrated above for just a few HST-taxable items.  And doesn't the word ""temporary"" above scare you just a little?  In addition,  if you think you'll get a flow-through savings from businesses, I think you're living in a dream world.  And why do you think McGuinty is shelling out ""transition"" bribes to taxpayers next year? I'm thinking ""smokescreen"", and sadly I think it just might work."
397954,fisherman7,2009-10-31 00:29:00,325,"We're all just a bunch of sheep when it comes to opposing the government, unless they try to tax the lottery! Remember that? The only time I even saw Canadians stand up."
397958,Cookslav,2009-10-31 00:35:00,1457,"Its crap...  Its not as though they need more Tax money to pay off anything, its about mismanagement of the funds we already give them. In this economic climate business has to cut back...we lay off, and restructure to survive Ultimately what happens is as business returns those still employed work harder to make the company run until hiring more labour is seen as necessary. This is a normal down turn cycle in any facet of business, regardless of the sector....unless your the premier  In his case he keeps things the same, and avoids the media to keep his job cushy, and easy. When poop hits the fan instead of cutbacks and restructure, he puts on a dog and pony show about paying back a debt that is apparently none of his fault.  While I can freely admit he is not to blame for the economic state as a whole I do question what he attempted to do about it as it went down, and his logic about who is at fault, and how to fix it....  The issue is mismanagement not merely a federal spending debt.  Its almost as criminal as Municipal taxes... You would think, the more homes we cram into a small place equals more tax revenue, and therefore less tax burden(i.e. maintenance) per street But nope.... Instead it goes up and up each year. Makes no sense what so ever."
397960,danbouck,2009-10-31 00:39:00,4380,I'm gonna make that money back by creating a webpage about the government screwing us and make people send (I mean donate) money to me!
397964,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-31 00:54:00,1107,I sent Dalton a e-mail about it months ago and got a generic reply to the affect of suck it up butter cup it going to happen no matter what we do even if its the last thing he does its his little project.
398011,Chris,2009-10-31 02:26:00,405, Wow. with that mentality it's no wonder we're screwed.
398013,Chris,2009-10-31 02:31:00,405," Yep, us taxpayers have a never-ending supply of money."
398020,Dara,2009-10-31 02:48:00,3052," I think you are out of line there Irishfield. A lot of people have no choice in the matter    We don't need it as a new normal. The new normal seems to be politicians being so used to lyeing that it is normal now. That crook McGuinty said NO New Taxes. This is a new tax.. I can understand the harmonizing part, but not at the same rate. It wouldn't have to be on electricity if the people of Ontario still owned the power plants they  are paying for. And all the new ones we are subsidizing construction on for the big guys    They are taking taxes to impress us with new spending...how much new spending do we really need? cripes, we are pretty comfortablenow. Maybe a little more on poverty, but a little less tax on some industries(forestry) wouldn't hurt.   The government is handing you a line of crap...why do you insist on buying it"
398023,albany_guide,2009-10-31 02:56:00,23,"  What's your solution?  Tell our foreign creditors, ""sorry, I know we borrowed that money to keep our economy from sinking into the abyss, but you'll just have to accept that we won't be paying you back""?  Not going to fly.  Here's a life lesson you had best understand:  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  People love to complain.  If the government had done nothing, people would have been complaining.  The government goes out and borrows money and then (oh the horror!) makes plans to pay it back, people complain.  You better get used to it.  We'll be paying this bill of for some time."
398024,irishfield,2009-10-31 03:01:00,26272," Not in the least in the context that I wrote it Dara. Sure there are those that have no choice in the matter... but as I wrote many have ""learned"" how to use the system.. and many of these learned from their parents.. and their parents parents. I could list dozens of families that went generation after generation... that never had to leave home to ""earn"" a living whether it was Welfare or Mothers allowance. They watched their parents milk it and realized it was a pretty darn good system. Now that was back in the day that the mother's allowance inspectors use to come around and if they even found a man's clothes in a closet the gal was cut off.. today that's against their rights.  Unemployment.. I won't even get into how many we hired only to find out that they needed just one more weeks work to qualify for a ""year off"" and come the following Monday we'd never see them again."
398028,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-31 03:07:00,2582,  Guess I'm too dumb to have a grasp on reality. I don't feel screwed at all. Maybe that's a good thing
398142,Jonny,2009-10-31 16:59:00,1380," Actually the push to harmonize the GST began long before the recession --- years ago when the Liberals were in power in Ottawa. Quebec and the Maritimes harmonized quite some time ago. It's a bad idea that is hard to kill, and now McGuinty and whoever in BC (Campbell?) are pushing it. BC seems much further on the road to killing it through public outcry than we are in Ontario. I'm not sure why that is.  The only way to kill this in Ontario is to make the Liberals fear losing the next election."
398153,bigfish1965,2009-10-31 17:57:00,3382, I didn't know they thought they could win it...lol. Hard to scare someone with nothing to lose.
398157,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-31 18:14:00,1107,"  exactly Dalton's little project ,but there is no way of stopping this there has been several e-mail campains and they all get the same generic P-off response we will be paying this for the rest of our lives just like every other new tax  .HST is supposed to ""Save tax payers money""(from the e-mail sent from Daltons office)they have convinced them selves that this ""needs"" to happen and it will nothing the tax payer can do .I don't mind paying taxes it makes Canada Canada but I get sick to my stomach every year when I do my taxes and see how much I'm giving them"
