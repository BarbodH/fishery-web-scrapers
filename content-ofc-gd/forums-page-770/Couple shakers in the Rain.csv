397927,Greencoachdog,2009-10-30 23:03:00,8163,"Nice healthy and strong looking fish!!!  I love it when the fish fill out like that and the head looks a little small for the body, it means they have more than enough to eat!!!... when the head looks too big for the body it's not good!  I know squat about troot smolts!  Thanks for taking the time to post though!"
398042,l2p,2009-10-31 04:01:00,346,i always thought the ones with orange bellies aswell as fins were resies?!
398068,silverstreak,2009-10-31 11:43:00,146,Not exactly sure why some yearlings have the orange coloration......could be diet or simply genetics. I also see this on some of my summertime Brookies. Cheers
