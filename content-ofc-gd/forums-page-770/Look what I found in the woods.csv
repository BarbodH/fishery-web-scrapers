397873,Daplumma,2009-10-30 19:42:00,1961,Found this guy walking around in the woods today.I was able to get pretty close but the camera was not on the right setting.    I came back later and he was checking himself out in the reflection of Bex car.He even did a little dance for me.   Joe
397876,irishfield,2009-10-30 19:45:00,26272,Last one looks like he's trying to sneak away... kinda like Art dodging paint balls...
397877,I'mHooked,2009-10-30 19:46:00,525,That's pretty cool!
397878,trapshooter,2009-10-30 19:47:00,1234,Nice Tom.  If it was spring he probably would have fought the reflection on the car.
397880,TC1OZ,2009-10-30 19:50:00,987,Those woods look very similar to your drive way
397930,siwash,2009-10-30 23:18:00,683,"Holy smokes, i thought those things were stealthful and skittish"
397932,Bernie,2009-10-30 23:26:00,3190,Isn't Thanksgiving coming up soon down there Joe? mmmmm
397936,Greencoachdog,2009-10-30 23:41:00,8163,"Isn't that your pet Turkey you had penned up with the chickens the last time I was up there Joe?... what was his name?... TJSA?  I remember him coming up and pecking on my boots for cracker crumbs and potato chips!... or am I full of it?... I can't remember which?  Cool pics Joe!  ... he was eating the chicken scratch, wasn't he?"
398123,Daplumma,2009-10-31 15:19:00,1961,Bex brought him some scratch grain yesterday and he ate it all up.The parking lot is where she works.If he hangs around I might invite him over for thankgiving.
398131,ChrisK,2009-10-31 16:06:00,2772,Try walkin up to one wearing camo and a shotgun in your hand
398150,POLLIWOGG,2009-10-31 17:48:00,835,"I guess I should have took a picture when my sister walked up to one picked it up and pet it on the head.  She came back to the house and my brother asks ""did you see any turkeys back there"" she opens up her coat and had the stupid thing under her arm."
398184,misfish,2009-10-31 20:36:00,29133,"Joe,theres an old saying,,,,,,,,,,,,Finders,keepers.  This pic looks like he is doing a fake sexual move on a hen.Seriously. "
398219,Daplumma,2009-10-31 23:01:00,1961,Looks like one of my roosters doin the chicken dance to me.They start doing that when they are barely peeps and do it till they die.I learned more about Turkeys from having chickens than any amount of time in the field.There is a high end retirement community near where this guy was.I suspect some old hunter has been baiting this young one in.Was cool to be that close and not pull the trigger.....yet. Joe
398316,aplumma,2009-11-01 14:36:00,6896,that's were my decoy went.......give it back when you are done with the pictures.   Art
