397558,BUSTER,2009-10-29 22:37:00,1336,"sooo , who's got the inside on this new top secret 2010 yamaha outboard?   maybe this guy can shed some light on us??????"
397567,aniceguy,2009-10-29 22:48:00,1094,"There is soooooooo much speculation on it... SOme say a turbo charged, some say its an electric some say yamaha has brought in its motorcycle technology and created a 10,000 rpm hole shot miracle machine  Truth is somewhere in between it all one thing for sure it will be a yamaha and those are reliable engines!!"
397671,Gman,2009-10-30 01:27:00,126,"Take a peak at this, supposed to be launched November 20th I believe.  http://www.yamahagamechanger.com/   Cheers, G."
397875,yakpiker,2009-10-30 19:42:00,160,"I think bass boats with big motors go too fast already...especially when they are heading in the direction of a kayak.  Hopefully, there is more to this story than just HP.  Reducing fuel consumption and emissions would be great."
397912,ecmilley,2009-10-30 21:42:00,2163,"need to repower soon, this just maybe the ticket"
397916,Gman,2009-10-30 21:50:00,126,From what I've been hearing from speaking with a few industry people is that it's going to be a light weight high output 4-stroke focused towards the bass boat market.  Guess we'll really have to wait and see.  Cheers G.
397920,walleyejigger,2009-10-30 22:10:00,876,"was really intrigued by the website till i watched the video, then i was like.............that's it............meh"
397929,gone_fishin,2009-10-30 23:17:00,481, but if it is indeed a four stroke with that kind of torque... up against a 2 stroke... that's pretty impressive!
397938,irishfield,2009-10-30 23:48:00,26272,"Video could be anything... could be two identical old motors even with nothing new built yet. Different prop.. throttle stop installed on the ""slow"" boat.. different trim/cav plate position.. you name it. Video proves nothing.. absolutely nothing."

398018,Twocoda,2009-10-31 02:43:00,4130,57 mph is fast enough for me ....i want something that can hold a predetermined speed of 2.2 through 3.7 in any water condition at the push of a button and run for 16 days on one tank fuel/gas/vegetable oil or  plutonium nyborge  i dont ask for much
398019,irishfield,2009-10-31 02:46:00,26272,Gee I'm close Twocoda.... I hit troll control for 4 to 5 MPH for Musky.. burn is 0.6 GPH on my 275 Verado. So a ten hour day on the water = 6 gallons... 80 gallon tank is 13 days... Can I bring a reserve can to get that extra 3 days?? lol  On the kicker... heck we'd be out for a month....
398031,BillM,2009-10-31 03:11:00,17367,"Wayne, the kicker is louder then the Verado  That motor hummed...  To bad you didn't goose it when we were out!"
398077,dave524,2009-10-31 12:29:00,4508,"I must be getting old, I remember a day when tournament rules specified 150 HP. max. There was some very conservatively rated motors around for the pro bass boat market, guess it is now anything goes."
398088,Gman,2009-10-31 13:32:00,126,"The FLW, both the bass and walleye circuits have a max hp allowance of 250.  Many are hoping the FLW will re-visit and increase it with the new 300+hp motors along the newly re-designed hull of the 2010 Ranger 621VS multi-species fisherman model which has a max hp rating of 300.  Those FLW tour pros will do anything for an extra few miles an hour.  Cheers G."
398229,Gman,2009-11-01 00:25:00,126,FLW axes TV coverage for walleye but at the same time removes the 250hp max in the walleye series!  http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=159217  Cheers G.
