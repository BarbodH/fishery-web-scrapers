397766,bigbuck,2009-10-30 12:35:00,2449,"That's too bad, I know a lot of guys on here carve on Chronzy but you know what, he opens peoples eyes to how simple fishing can be, he goes up North, and catches a ton of fish using a jig and a plastic minnow, no fancy baits, 30 rods/reels, etc... And he has a shore lunch, one of the most fun and enjoyable aspects of fishing in the boonies. I hope the big guy gets well soon."
