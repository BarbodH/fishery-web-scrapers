397536,canadianboy,2009-10-29 20:31:00,83,had to bump this up to say has noone heard of the band anvil. they sort of made it big in metal in the 80's and metallica listed anvil as their inspiration and anvil could never get steady record deals or production its in their movie anvil: the stroy of anvil. i actually almost cried i felt so bad for them

Must be something with November 13. While looking at my concert stubs, I noticed the first time I saw Slayer was  November 13, & exactly 21 years to the day later, here they are again. This might be better, cuz now it's Friday the 13th! And yeah, I feel old..."
