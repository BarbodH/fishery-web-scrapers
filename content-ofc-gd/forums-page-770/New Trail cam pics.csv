398272,Skud,2009-11-01 03:55:00,739,My camera shot some good photos the last few days.  I think I finally snapped a pic of the dominant Buck for the area. Very camera shy but with a crown like his he is probably the top dog. It is also the only picture of a buck I have with a Doe. The rut is almost here.    Here is another good picture of three Does together.
