398025,jediangler,2009-10-31 03:02:00,1923,They definately deserved the single point tonight. I can't believe they are rushing Kessel back into the line-up. They are talking about him playing as early as Tuesday. He was supposed to be out until the end of November. Not likely he'll play long before getting hurt again anyway. If he gets hurt again he can say goodbye to his Olympic chances. That's why he came to Toronto after all. That and $5 million per.
