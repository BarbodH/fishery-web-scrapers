397679,tibbs,2009-10-30 01:48:00,650,"Yep i use them. They are an awesome bait in the spring. I remember i hooked and landed 3 fish on 3 casts during opener. I've never used them during the fall season, but i think I'm going to try it this year."
397680,wallacio,2009-10-30 01:49:00,475,They are definitely effective under the right conditions.   They are actually pretty standard fare south of the border by even casual Steelheaders...often used to tip small jigs for pressured fish in clear conditions.

397770,Beats,2009-10-30 12:57:00,543,"I started using waxworms for ice fishing last season.  Did really well with them on dropper hooks about 8-12"" below a spoon.  Just jig the spoon for flash to bring the fish in and they go for the wax worms.  I was buying them at Petsmart but I remember them being quite expensive.  Not sure where else to get them.  Probably not cheaper at a bait shop."
397772,Bly,2009-10-30 13:12:00,1556,"Beats,  I hadn't thought to look at a pet store for them, thanks!   Usually purchase them at one of the local tackle shops for a reasonable price but they do not always have them in stock."
