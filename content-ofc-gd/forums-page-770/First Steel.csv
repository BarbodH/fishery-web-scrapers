397760,okumasheffield,2009-10-30 11:03:00,318,River mouth? Which secret river has river mouth?  Shhh ...... my secret steelhead bait is torn Senko cut into 10mm pieces (dont tell anyone!)
397761,Cudz,2009-10-30 11:04:00,2652,I may be wrong but I am pretty sure Bill was kidding.  It was a tongue in cheek comment hence the smilie.  I may be wrong but I bet he was being sarcastic.
397781,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-30 13:43:00,2050," First off I'm not knockin' Bill directly - he has some solid posts on here and I think he's a good guy.... no doubt he could fish circles around me when it comes to steelhead.  I was just trying to back up young_one a little, in that if he doesn't want to black out the backgrounds it's his choice.  It just burns my    at this time of year, when somebody posts a picture of his prized catch, and the first thing all these steelheaders do is jump all over the guy about his background.  I know OFC has lost a few members in the past because of this.  Anyways, my reply probably would have been a little more long winded and explanatory but I was typing it on my BB.  Again, thanks for the report Young_One - good work.  Cheers, Ryan"
397789,I'mHooked,2009-10-30 14:15:00,525,"I don't understand what it is about water, mud and trees that gives a spot away?  Like has been previously mentioned, if someone has never been to ""the"" spot before, how would they recognize it other than from some potentially obvious landmark such as an historic building in the back ground or bridge etc.?  I could see blacking out the CN tower in the back ground if you were at the mouth of the credit"
397798,BillM,2009-10-30 14:49:00,17367,"  Chris, I'm glad that your sarcasm meter isn't broken.  To all the other guys that went on paragraph long rants, thanks for the laughs!!!!!  To the OP: If you haven't figured it out yet, I was joking..  I wasn't joking however on complimenting you on that awesome buck, that is a great fish!!!"
397811,GBW,2009-10-30 15:29:00,8460,I'm not to sure where Taro is in this pic but those are some nice fish...    Maybe I should edit that pic...  
397866,fishinguypat,2009-10-30 19:27:00,547,i live in kitchener and i always find it nie that people in downtown toronto are so close to such a great fishery! and the backgrounds don't matter that much..try aiming the pics lower
397881,I'mHooked,2009-10-30 19:51:00,525," Picture #1, aha, must be Toronto!  Picture #2, hmmm, not quite sure...South shore of Erie?  "
397561,young_one,2009-10-29 22:43:00,620,"First steelhead of the season, not counting shakers and grocery store size.  Didn't keep any loose Salmon roe this season, forcing myself to use soft plastic and tying my own flies/jigs.  Caught a smaller female earlier, quick release before I could get hold of the fish.  (Riverwood pinkies)   FISH ON!   The secret lure, white crappie tube! It went up the leader, like tube fishing for Smallie     Released to be fought another day! TRUE STORY, a very nice fisherman on the other side caught this fish again after half hr of release. Took the pinkie he was using, LMAO released one more time!  When the time is right, these fish will hit anything!"
397564,tibbs,2009-10-29 22:47:00,650,Great Job!!  Pink Worms are my favorite lure for steelhead.
397566,drwxr,2009-10-29 22:48:00,453,beautiful fall colors. thanks.
397568,Leecher,2009-10-29 22:49:00,7832,Nice Steel young_one You got to love that when you can hook the same fish twice..... hungry little bugger Thanks for sharing Leechman
397573,MJL,2009-10-29 22:54:00,2427,Beauty fish Will  Well done  On the opener Victor caught the same fish twice within half an hour on the same pink worm
397576,MJL,2009-10-29 22:57:00,2427,PS  Shouldn't you be in class?
397595,BillM,2009-10-29 23:28:00,17367,That's a big male!!  Way to go!  For future reference you might wanna black out the backgrounds
397622,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-30 00:04:00,0,that's a big boy!
397635,KelfuN,2009-10-30 00:19:00,246,nice looking buck!! surprised that spot wasn't crowded with people.
397666,l2p,2009-10-30 01:10:00,346,"nice fish, even nicer of you for the release. i think i remember bumping into you on that same river not too long ago, keep at it!"
397667,Paully,2009-10-30 01:14:00,712,  Yeah.. that river is now ruined!!  .. so dont bother going there this weekend..
397670,StoneFly,2009-10-30 01:27:00,574,"Nice Job on the Pinkie,....anyone else find they work best in stained fast flows?"
397675,lucabrasi,2009-10-30 01:41:00,114,Nice fish!   Yup
397683,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-30 01:59:00,2050,"Man give the guy a break! He tried something new and got into some fish! He's happy, so give him some props and shut it. Personally I think it ruins the picture when people black out the backgrounds but if that's what you want to do its your choice, as it may be some peoples preference not to.  Awesome report dude, beauty fish!"
397686,fishhunter,2009-10-30 02:05:00,604,Way to go bud!!! If you need some row I can give you a jar. Just pm me
397695,anders,2009-10-30 02:20:00,1168,that is a brute...congrats!!
397703,StoneFly,2009-10-30 02:47:00,574, Just curious why you are ranting here?
397714,fishhunter,2009-10-30 03:14:00,604,keep posting the pics how ever you want!!!! Its your shot not anyone elses. Way to go keep up the good fishing. Hope we end up fishing together again.
397715,GBW,2009-10-30 03:16:00,8460,well said.
397717,StoneFly,2009-10-30 03:34:00,574," Bill,...you know as well as I do that stretch of river could be one of many that all look the same,...besides you also know,... the fish move,...besides you also know....if someone recognizes a spot,  they have fished there before.  C'MON now,...there are litterally 1000' of pools holding fish right now around northern and southern Lake O and E tribs,....Anyone who knows what they are doing,... does it by this time of year!!!  I myself can say with 100% confidence that I have never ever made a decision on where to fish from this or any other website,....I take all the factors and recent weather conditions into account, the decide where I am going,  I think most guys do it the same as me including yourself,...if anyone decides where to fish because you saw a post you think you recognize from the day before....I call that CHOOCH!!! not too mention dumb  and lazy   lol  Yo bud,...Im not saying you do this...  Maybe there is more sensitivity to the beggining of the season when every one is Jonesing,...lol...and trust I hear ya,...but I got my first river chromer this fall over a month ago during one of the first salmon runs,..total fluke (100 kms up river and a silver little buck) but it took a little edge off.  But now its game on everywhere!!!   Some backgrounds add to the pics.....its a personal choice,...if im in a nice valley with leaves and crap,...I will get a pic with a background,..then get one straight on the water,...no biggie either way.  How about this background?  cheers,     "
397721,kentooley,2009-10-30 04:02:00,208,Thanx StoneFly for being so polite.  I think alot of us are getting a little tired of Bill M's expert remarks.  :clapping:  :clapping:  :clapping:
397723,StoneFly,2009-10-30 04:07:00,574,"Bahahahahah dont worry abour Bill's comments ...he is just an AVID steelheader...as am I,..as you will be ...   Fishon Bro!!!"
397728,young_one,2009-10-30 04:24:00,620,"Thanks for all the replies! As for the background, I fully understand the consequence of me not blacken the background. In future I might just post those boring pictures with my beginner float reel (Aventa) and the fish. I guess its better to keep things secret  Lloyd, thanks for the roe offer, but I'll try to commite myself not using them. I guess its just like Bass fishing without leeches, minnow or worm. My dad and I almost finish our DIY planner board and mast, we could be on the bay as soon as this Sunday!  MJL, no class in the morning! But going into class in the afternoon was not fun at all! You been fishing?"
397757,fishhunter,2009-10-30 10:25:00,604,"keep the good pics coming. I was a river rat for over 30 years and if i had guys on the rivers with me well then thats the way it was!! The fish and streams are for everyone to share and enjoy so dont show stuppid float reel shots just because a few guys think that you willhurt a spot or there chances to be a river master. Show what mother nature wanted people to see. Trees, Water, Sky and that big ass fish you got. People think that posting a pic is going to hurt their chances of being king of the river for the day. Pics are for people to look at and enjoy and if they know that spot already then it does not matter at all because they know about it already.Remember this if nothing else FISH are a by product not the end all be all Its all about friendship and enjoying what nature and the MNR have given us to enjoy. My last 2 cents on this. play well with others and if you cant dont pick on ones that can"
397758,KelfuN,2009-10-30 10:38:00,246,"well said both Lloyd and Stonefly!  i really don't see a need to hide the background. anyone here think there IS a secret spot out east??? don't forget, we can ONLY fish below hwy 2 now. so really, what secret spots are there.  an average steelheader will fish that pool, either this weekend or next...we all fish enough to know which river holds more fish than others in the fall season. but in the dead winter thats a different story, cause everyones gonna be at the same river mouth"
