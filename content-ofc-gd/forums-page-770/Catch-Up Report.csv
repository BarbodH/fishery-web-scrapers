397366,Ramble,2009-10-29 06:24:00,713,Alright… I know it has been a long time since I last posted a report. So I thought I’d drop an update post. It’s going to be the abbreviated version of what was an excellent summer.  So here we go.
397367,Ramble,2009-10-29 06:25:00,713,"I got out a few evenings shore fishing off the Belleville marina with my sister.       Her 1st walleye.    The day before I went north for another season at Kesagami I snuck off to the hunting camp with a couple buddies and we hit up a back lake for some lakers. We landed 4 in 4 hours and miss 3 hits and lost one boat side. Needless to say it was a hell of an outing.              Don’t worry, they are all stocked fish.      Then I was off to Kesagami. That report is in progress and will be up at some point in the future. But ill stick a few photos for your amusement. Step one was a visit to Bunk’s while he was still in the north. It was a good adventure and will be covered in the Kesagami report. But it was another great summer guiding.          "
397368,Ramble,2009-10-29 06:26:00,713,"Once I got home I had a few outings for largies on a couple of home body of water. My buddy Sweet Pea, who I work with at Kesagami came down for a week and gave me a hand on the fence.                     My girlfriend, who I also met at the lodge, made it out for a few outings herself. We had a great shore lunch one afternoon and finished off the last of the lakers from the spring.                "
397369,Ramble,2009-10-29 06:26:00,713,"I also managed an outing with my sister before we headed off to our different universities.                   I also got out for a couple of solo outings myself for musky. I have never caught one while fishing for them. I tied into a 37 inch fish alone, after dark in the canoe. After an airborne battle I landed it without a net and popped the hook out boatside with no trouble. Four seasons at Kesagami provided me with the necessary training. Sorry no photo.  Before school started dad and I made a day trip up to Algonquin for a bit of an adventure. My grandmother isn’t in the best health and dad looks after her every day. So we couldn’t do the week long trip like usual.                 "
397371,Ramble,2009-10-29 06:26:00,713,"Since I have been back at school fishing has essentially ended. I’ve been out experiencing the joys of waterfowling and LOVE it. My 1st geese came as a double and my 1st duck was a drake woodie.                             So that’s pretty much it. There has been a few other minor outings. But these have been the most notable. I CAN’T WAIT for ice fishing to get started. I think my auger is going through withdrawals.    Till next time, tight lines.  -Dave"
