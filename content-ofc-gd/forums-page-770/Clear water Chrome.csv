Tried Pinkies earlier in the week with nary a glance only to have them pound it over the last couple day's. Everyday is different and I guess that's what keeps me ""Chromin"" Have a safe weekend. Cheers. "
397984,BillM,2009-10-31 01:26:00,17367,Nice buck!
398000,MJL,2009-10-31 02:00:00,2427,"Beauty buck Jim.  I was out today for a couple hours this morning and it seemed pink was definitely the colour of choice.  Pink roe bags, pink worms, pink marabou jigsâ€¦Got a few hits on a purple & black jig but everything else was ignored (including my magic spinners   ).  Mike"
398003,okumasheffield,2009-10-31 02:08:00,318,"I have come to realize that steelheading is all about going fishing on weekdays.  Being a weekend warrior sucks .... oh look, it rained today and will rain more tomorrow"
398010,Twocoda,2009-10-31 02:24:00,4130,"lately up here it just as bad on the weekdays as it is on the weekends...literally ...i have to go elsewhere ...   tuesday wednesday and thurday  the words that came out of my mouth ...""doesnt anybody work anymore???"""
398033,timmeh,2009-10-31 03:18:00,609," I've noticed that this too this fall. Took a day off last week and was hoping to have a little more room to fish but the crowds were still there. Oh well, still nice to get out.  Nice fish too.  Oh and O-S don't curse the rain, we need that."
398035,StoneFly,2009-10-31 03:25:00,574,"Nice Fish Bud!!!  not sure about crowds where you were, but I saw noone all afternoon until I was leaving, one guy showed up.  but then again it wasnt all that 'Fair Weather' today."
398050,kemper,2009-10-31 05:45:00,2232,"interesting I coudlnt even get a sniff on a pinky today....only thing I could find that worked was tiny roe bags, two bangers as I like to call them"
398067,silverstreak,2009-10-31 11:35:00,146, I fish after work and after all the roe guy's have had thier way with the pools. Still manage to hook some chrome on artificials.Perhaps that is the key.
398069,silverstreak,2009-10-31 11:50:00,146, Kemp Also managed a few fish on large chartruse salmon sacs inbetween the Pinky bite. Fish infront of me must have been fresh as they were the hardest fighting fish I have hooked yet this yr.
398072,silverstreak,2009-10-31 11:55:00,146,Mike I guess your vest is as heavy as mine. Glad to hear you hooked a few. Cheers
398185,lucabrasi,2009-10-31 20:38:00,114,"As a roe slinger, I really need to commit more to artificials. My vest is stuffed with them   Nice fish! Thanks!  BTW, is that a little jig head I see in the pic there? Do you rig it wacky?"
