398279,Ramble,2009-11-01 05:49:00,713,There was a questionare on the MNR site in teh spring i think looking for feed back on Kawartha fisheries management. Not sure if you saw it or not....and i'm not sure if it is still around. most of the walleye questions were dealing with a reduction or change in the slot.  -Dave
