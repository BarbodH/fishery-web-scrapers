He was actually an avid angler and fought hard to bring in positive changes to the MNR . His focus brought about a massive increase in the number of CO's in the province and the beginning of new regional season variations that reflected the needs of that ecosystem. He truly understood Ontario. He brought in the licensing system to increase funds to the Ministry and as a way to track and punish resource violators.  He will be missed.
