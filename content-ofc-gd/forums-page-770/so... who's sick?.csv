""All involved with hospital care"" is a little loose.  I'm ""involved"" but do not qualify sick time if ill.  That and, no one forces me to go to work anymore on schedule.  Regular permanent employees MisFish do tend to be held to different standards at times than those who are casual employees.  Because I have no regular employment at this time... I'm not sure as to what the policy is this year for all staff at the place which I work.  By percentages you might be talking about your qualifying for the shot???  H3N1 was around in 73 and I believe it was an H1N2 that may have been present in the not so distant past as well.  Those over 65 especially, but also adults whom have been around since early 70's, may have antibodies already to H1N1 because of previous contacts with variations of the virus.  Those over 65 have a considerably better chance as I understand it.  You and your old-timer buddies might be better off than guys like me... most certainly the kids though who likely haven't ever been in contact with this type strain of influenza."

I have read both sides and made my decision.  You?  Ok, you have already, fine.  Seen anyone with polio or smallpox lately, or whooping cough or diphtheria?  THIS IS WHAT VACCINES DO.  Please inform yourself, vaccines work and save lives.  Mebbe read a little about Jonas Salk, or thimerosal and its toxicity, and make your own informed decision."

397685,Cookslav,2009-10-30 02:01:00,1457," Hey Bill I'm with ya.... According to The Ontario Ministry of health on a national Averages 500-1500 flu-related deaths occur per year in Canada.... According to the Public health agency of Canada 89 anadians have died of swine flu(and swine flu related) deaths over the past year and a half.... Annual Flu epidemics world wide are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths every year... while apparently 5,000 have died globally from H1N1 so far.  Those are the numbers.... So this World wide data suggests 'if"" you catch a flu in general you have 1%-2% chance that it could be a fatal case of H1N1 Canadian specific info suggests any flu you may catch carries a 0.6-1.8% chance of being a fatal case of H1N1 However it also says the regular flu is almost 12x more likely yo kill you then H1N1  To me the jury is still out on this one, and probobly will be until the season ends, and the Data is collected. That being said I don't think there is a right or wrong answer as long as your comfortable in you assement.  No one should be vilified for not taking the shot if they've done their homework, and feel its an unessasary risk. And like wise I won't chastize anyone for getting it.  Just do your homework and make a decision you can live with."

Influenza is a very serious respiratory illness, nothing to do with some a bad case of the skoots."

Once again when faced with the facts (5,000 H1N1 deaths wordwide compared to 250,000 - 500,000) the name calling starts....this time surprisingly by Moosebunk and Doug.   I guess unless we do just what you do and act just as you do and think just as you do we are ignorant. Thank god we have overpaid healthcare workers to show us how to see the error of our ways. By the way, being you are a healthcare worker that knows everything, maybe you could tell us what obscene amount of our taxpayer money is going to be thrown at this ""pandemic"". I can see the healthcare bean-counters salivating already. I wonder how much the pharmaceutical companies will make on this vaccine? Probably nothing as they just want to help us, right?  And GCD, you sound like you're trying too hard to be controversial. Maybe the droves of people standing in line for hours climbing over each other, jumping the queue and getting in line before the ""high-risk"" individuals (as shown on CTV news tonight) are the real skeerdy cats. Skeerdy cats fueled by media hype.  As I said before, the sad thing here is that our political and business leaders have become so untrustworthy it is very hard to decide which side is telling the truth anymore. And in light of the corruption and greed shown by our leaders, and the obscene prices that pharmaceutical companies charge for their ""legal"" drugs, I think I will err on the side of caution and keep my family away from their vaccine. I hope I'm right for the sake of my daughter, but there is no way in hell I trust our politicians or the very big business of drugs/pharmaceuticals considering the amounts of money involved."

The scary part here is all have been either younger children and middle aged men  with no other health problem. Some of these men are now in  ICU on   assited breathing and IV.

The latest facts came in today 1300 known deaths from swine flue since July in the USA and the flue season is just starting with up to 6 million cases now being confirmed.

Methylmercury is the toxin we see in fish...the one that is the one to worry about and the one we ingest each time we eat a fish from the great lakes. Your virologist friend is contradicted by the WHO and Health Canada. Thimerosol is also in the regular flu vaccine. It is a preservative.

Go to  the ""Public Health Agency Of Canada"" website.  Please read and be informed.  http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1...1n1-eng.php#vac  These are answers to two of the comments made previously.  Why is my arm sore and Mercury in the flu vaccine.  Should children and adults expect the same type of side effects, if any?  The most commonly reported reactions after H1N1 immunization with the adjuvanted vaccine were minor and included pain, swelling and redness at the injection site.  This is to be expected because the adjuvant helps the body develop a stronger immune response by increasing the inflammatory response.   Is it true that there is mercury in the vaccine? How much mercury?  Both vaccines contain a small amount of thimerosal. Thimerosal is a form of mercury used in the H1N1 flu vaccine to stabilize it and maintain its quality during storage. Thimerosal is a different form of mercury than the mercury known to cause health problems. The amount in the H1N1 adjuvanted flu vaccine is much less than the daily limit recommended for environmental exposure to mercury.  For example, there is significantly less mercury in the vaccine than you would find in a can of tuna fish.   Tom"

He's fine now, full of piss and vinegar... my daughter is fine, but I have been fighting what appears to be a cold for 10 days. I heart goes out to the families of those who have been taken by this flu, but injecting myself or my kids is not something I have very much interest in doing, I have significant concerns.

A perfectly healthy person will survive H1N1, however, someone who has asthma, diabetes, etc. will have a harder time combatting H1N1 once they contract it."

I hate the internet sometimes... The spread and infection process is easily traced. Read the WHO site..stay off of websites made by paranoid guys living in bunkers in Montana and Saskatchewan. Stop reading the chain emails that are all Bull.  And...let me just completely accept your theory for one second... so I should not get the shot, cause that gives cash to a company who infected the population before even knowing they would be able to get and develop a vaccine and be the one selected to provide it. But if I get the shot, that helps slow down the spread of the virus and reduces the need for other meds with a much higher profit margin..like Tamiflu, Advil, Tylenol etc. And yes, I will likely survive the flu should I get it but what about those who I pass it on to? What about those perfectly healthy people who die from it? Do you think the inventors of Cold FX (which works very well and both a treatment and a preventative) invented the cold, too??"

Do you think they would risk one of their own dying? And you have heard of the mob contracts in Montreal right? Do you not think there are backroom deals being made before the fact?   Or you get the shot they make money and then make money treating the side effects.  Cold fx profits are peanuts.  Its also a good way to install fear and keep the people distracted from other things going on. May be a long shot but I have seen much worse things.
397471,ozaibak1,2009-10-29 16:19:00,401,"The reason this pandemic seems to be manufactured is that hundreds of thousands of people are dying from other strains of flu per year, yet for some reason are not as important as this strain which is killing a tiny fraction of that. It's just another strain of flu, get over it people. It's not proven to be more dangerous. And guess what, young and healthy people die from other strains of the flu as well, in much higher numbers.  Why all the media attention and focus about this particular one? It is not as deadly as other strains.  If you are healthy and have a good immune system, you will be fine. Don't believe the hype. Either way, people's minds are made up about which way to go and are very difficult to change, so I will not try nor am I interested in trying."

Ran into traffic on one of the main roads through town and figured it was an accident. Well, guess what, there is a vaccination clinic set up in a church hall (large church hall) with an even larger parking lot. A quick calculation figured that there had to be 500-750 in line backed up through the parking lot and waaaaay down the street. Not sure how many they could vaccinate per hour, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't only an hour or two wait! There were 3 police officers that had the road down to one lane with cruisers blocking the road with their lights flashing, not really sure what they were doing at the point, but apparently when the doors opened it was a mad free for all and they had to close up shop until the officers arrived to provide some law and order. Again, I did not see it first hand but was told that there were dozens of minivans in the parking lot each had one person waiting in line. When the church hall doors opened the minivan doors opened and everyone ran for the entrance! Was told that there was up to 8-10 people got out of some of the vans. Of course the media was there filming earlier in the day causing additional chaos.  So, what is everyone's take on this? Do I work in an unusually unruly town or is this just the tip of the iceberg?"

397572,aniceguy,2009-10-29 22:52:00,1094,"I posted this on my face book and then more was added.  God this H1n1 is just out of control. The virology of it is no real difference then a flu other than some genetic anomalies . Its new and hence no immunity to it, but that can be said of any newly mutated strain of any flu. Those years that we have a severe flu outbreak is just a newly mutated strain that we have no immunity towards Upwards of 30,000 to 50,000 people yearly die from influenza or complications thereafter. People die of the flu. This is no consolation to the family of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio, the Toronto boy who died Monday, apparently after contracting swine flu. But it is true although he had an underlying condition that was impacted by the flu. This was so before this latest pandemic. It will almost certainly continue to be so in the future. But it is no reason to go off the deep end. Keep things in perspective. What is worrisome about this particular strain, sometimes known as Novel Swine-origin Influenza A (H1N1), is its newness. We know, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, that is contains genes from pigs, humans and birds. We know from experience that such a mix gives it the potential to pass back and forth between species and to become particularly virulent. Which is presumably one reason why the public health establishment is so fixated on swine flu. The other reason may that world governments are using this pandemic as a test run to see how they would respond to a real crisis. But what we also know is that, so far, this flu strain has been no more serious than any other. To put it another way: Before the H1N1 scare, the death of a few wouldn't have led newscasts across the nation. Consider the facts. According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died around the globe from this variant of swine flu. In any normal year, influenza causes between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths worldwide. In the Southern Hemisphere, the winter flu season is now over. In spite of dire predictions, only 185 people died from swine flu in Australia – considerably fewer than the roughly 3,000 who succumb to seasonal influenza in that country each year. And no, it wasn't because the population was immunized. Australia's vaccination campaign against swine flu took off last month. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama declared swine flu a national emergency after about 1,000 Americans died. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 50,000 Americans die every year from seasonal flu – without any politician paying much attention. What does seem to be true, according to early statistics, is that this particular strain is harder on people in the prime of their lives. Common flu strains tend to hit the very young and very old. In that sense, the real novelty of this novel H1N1 strain may be that it is killing the wrong people. For those youngish and middle-aged people who tend to dominate both politics and the media, this is understandably worrying. What's more unnerving, however, is the level of hype surrounding this flu virus, hype that at times comes dangerously close to hysteria. The public health dictum suggesting that people wash their hands to prevent the virus' spread has transformed itself, in some areas (like the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa) into a near-ban on shaking hands. Demand for hand sanitizers has exploded, as individuals and institutions search for ways to make physical contact safe. Yet experts are divided over handwashing. A 2007 study done for the Public Health Agency of Canada and chaired by Toronto microbiologist Donald Low concluded that the practice does little to prevent flu transmission, largely because this particular virus is airborne. Polls show that the public is taking a casual attitude toward swine flu. This alarms those beating the H1N1 drum. But given the actual evidence, maybe the public is onto something. That being said I have always been a fan of having one’s own immunity system fight an infection or virus if it’s in check obviously. To answer the question would I get the vaccine. No not until its mutated and is much more virulent, and the death rate starts to reach millions globally.

Never understood why pathophysiology including disease and illness isn't drilled into school aged children throughout the younger and teenage years.  Like French or even math should have more importance than hard knowledge of a persons most important life subject... their own human health.    Got the shot last night.  Didn't have too, but working in ER's these days there's just too much risk to me, my family and my patients.  And this year, nearly all Health Professionals who are educated and working their lives in Healthcare, will get the shot.  Not even because they have too, because the projected pros outweigh the cons by a landslide... as is the case this and EVERY flu season preceeding... regardless of how tough a flu season it might become or not.  Funny thing is though... I just can't believe how stupid all us doctors, nurses, and health care providers really are... I mean afterall... there's WAAAAAAAAAY more smart people at OFC in this thread particularily, who know this stuff better than us and are saying we're weak dummies to get all wrapped up in such media driven hype.   No wonder the ER's are swamped.  H1N1 isn't at all the epidemic ignorance is."
397614,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-29 23:52:00,621,"I seldom participate in this sort of thread  I agree with JPD,allow your immune system to defend itself,I also think the more medicated we progress ourselves socialy the more complex medically the disease and viruses may become. I certainly do not think its a conspiracy but more so the transformation and mutation of these virus and diseases due to our evolving pharmaceutical development But..........  In 2005 I contracted True Strain Influenza and was hopitalized. A entire process of tracking its origins and people I contacted ensued but nothing was ever identified. I short,I was transported to the hospital by ambulance and upon checking my pressure at the hospital,i went into ceasure,at the time they thought its was cardiaque arrest but soon figured out I was contagious with influenza.Generally a form of true strain influenza is low in all provinces. Basically had I not gone to the hospital,the follow day was unsure to the doctors what the outcome may have been,it had progressed quite far and hospitalized for 2 days. I was prescribed Tamiflu which I took for 3 days out of 10,I had to cease due to severe intolerance to the product.  The flu is common and kills some every year,influenza in its many true strains(not the flu),Hong Kong, Spanish,Avian and now H1N1 are virus that do weaken us to the point of failure. Having been through the entire ordeal,I can assure all its,un-pleasant.  Having said that,I do believe its sensationalized by the media I do believe in awareness of the potential targeted age groups and types  My best advice keep yourself healthy and clean  Just because you get a cold or the flu,does not mean H1 N1 Be aware of the symptoms  A flu that is not taking care of,can become a bad flu too"

The health care 'debate' is a case in point.  Instead of debating whether the current President is making wise decisions in the best interest of the US, the debate has devolved to whether Obama is Hitler.  Back to my backyard, reading this thread is a sad thing for me and mirrors some of the incredible crap mentioned above.  Naysayers defend their ignorance as a justifiable position and celebrate fear mongers and conspiracy theorists.  Our current debate pits facts against Bull and calls it a difference of opinion.   This similarity to the debate in the US is most troubling to me, and I don't get it.  There's a 'low information' mob shouting 'Shenanigans' holding the most vulnerable of our folks out as sacrifices to their refusal to protect their own health and those of the weakest members of their families.  Shame.  If you don't understand why people are standing in line for flu protection for eight hours outside holding a baby, then maybe you should do some research and do a favour for your family, your employer, the folks on the bus, and your sick Gramma.

My wife and 2 of my other children got the shot.  I am supposed to get it tomorrow at 830 but I can`t make it.  I am kind of thinking I might not get the shot but then who knows.  So many conflicting reports. I am a teacher and teach North (actually west) of Orillia.  I would say I have about 5 kids per class missing. That is above normal.  I have a hard time believing this is an issue but when perfectly healthy kids are starting to die it becomes a bit scary.

Lot's and lot's of huge profits to be made and our gov't. is right in bed with them. Just like they are in bed with big oil and insurance companies. A few years ago the flavor of the day was West Nile Virus.....Don't hear anything about that anymore do we? This is typical knee-jerk reaction to fearmongering.  Maybe I'm wrong but, if we had politicians or a political party that could actually be trusted I would consider getting the shot. To me that is the real shame here if in fact this threat is as real as they claim. Many, many Canadians and Americans no longer have any trust in their leaders and that is a sad state of affairs.  Yeah maybe I'm just another conspiracy theorist......but I'd rather be that than someone who blindly trusts the most powerful criminals we have on the planet.

397408,Cookslav,2009-10-29 12:52:00,1457,"Ok heres a thought to ponder for those freaked out by the H1N1 Scare.  According to The Ontario Ministry of health on a national Averages 500-1500 flu-related deaths occur per year in Canada.... According to the Public health agency of Canada 89 anadians have died of swine flu(and swine flu related) deaths over the past year and a half.... Annual Flu epidemics world wide are thought to result in between three and five million cases of severe illness and between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths every year... while apparently 5,000 have died globally from H1N1 so far...  That is no reason to panic IMO? These numbers don't lie... Its fairly apparent that this has been blown up much larger then it needs to be thanks to our media coverage.  Its sad that some people died...it always is when people die, but this is nothing to panic over. I have to echo Kempers origional thoughts on the matter.  Its a flu...a really bad flu But when you look at the numbers its nothing to get worked up over, and my guess iss 300 kids missing school is more then likely a combination of a few sick kids, and a healthy dose of panic but I guess we'll see when this all blows over.  Get the shot if feel you need it, don't if you do not trust it....talk to your doctor, and get the facts.  For those inclinded to read a bit on the subject http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/provid.../flumap_mn.html http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alert-alerte/h1...illance-eng.php"
397411,Jer,2009-10-29 13:11:00,1426,"I've got serious mixed feelings on this one.  I've never had a flu shot to my recollection...and never had what I would think was a case of the flu either. I get the odd cold and maybe a short bout of ""stomach flu"" occasionally.  What concerns me about H1N1, although it doesn't seem to kill in huge numbers, it's who it kills. It seems the young and healthy are most at risk, with the most severe symptoms. Fatality numbers from seasonal flu outbreaks are usually heavily padded with the deaths of many elderly and otherwise compromised individuals. The flu being the straw that broke their back, so to speak. When we see a strain that kills an otherwise apparently healthy young hockey player within a couple days of not feeling well, that's scary.  Anyways, I'm still torn on the subject."
397413,Governator,2009-10-29 13:19:00,879,I'm getting the seasonal flu shot for the first time and then I do plan to get the h1n1 as well.  I'd rather take comfort in knowing I'm doing what I can to protect my 2 month old who can't get any of the shots.
397415,canadadude,2009-10-29 13:24:00,769,"The idea of vacination is to catch the H1N1 in it's infancy and not have hundreds of thousands of deaths.....this flue strain is very severe and seems to infect portions of the population that have good immune systems in place.  If this strain reaches epidemic proportions it's to late and very hard if not impossible to control, maybe it is blown out of proportion but I think the health organizations of the world see the potential of this becoming a very bad pandemic. It's better to take precautions now when the flue is at a controllable level then to wait and have thousands of deaths just to prove the skeptics wrong."
397417,ADB,2009-10-29 13:26:00,444," So you're saying that everytime you're sick you stay home?  Because if you went out, you'd be spreading a virus, just as you're accusing JP of doing.  It's a fact that people who aren't as ""strong,"" as you put it,  die every year from the normal flu strain. It's unavoidable.  People who get the flu shot still get sick, and it'll be the same with the H1N1 vaccine.  We can't live in a bubble.  Do your best to boost your inherent immune system by doing things that are a lot more natural that getting a shot - get a proper amount of sleep, cut down on sugar, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, take vitamin supplements, cut out coffee and smoking.  Doing these things is a lot more helpful to society than getting a flu shot that hasn't been proven effective.  My parents never believed in getting shots.  I haven't been immunized for anything, except for any shots I got when I was born.  Polio, the mumps, rubella, and the flu - I suppose I'm succeptable to all of these, but yet, I haven't ever had any of them.  I've never had the flu, unless you count a seasonal cold.  And the same goes for my brother who hasn't had any vaccinations either. Why would I start getting shots now?  If the flu shot and the H1N1 vaccine are so effective, then those who are immunized shouldn't be worried by the people who elect to not get the shot.  They should be protected, no?  Yet they're still worried. Doesn't this defeat the purpose?"
397421,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 13:36:00,3382," Chris, the 'big bad pharmaceutical companies' (yeah the same ones that came up with the polio vaccine, smallpox vaccine etc) make far more money off those who do NOT get the shot. Treatment costs far more than prevention...always has. Maybe you don't hear about West Nile because of all the pesticide programs put into place to combat it.  I read that many of us who lived through and where exposed to the last swine flu may be immune to this one which is why it is hitting the younger kids harder this time. Last spring all you conspiracy guys were saying that H1N1 was a made up story when the W.H.O. said it would be a pandemic this fall. They were right about the pandemic.  But I would rather trust my doctor who has accurately and successfully diagnosed and treated me through cancer and a few other maladies than the paranoid ramblings of conspiracy addicts."

But its holding off for now  My neice was diagnosed with the swine last week.........she went to school feeling a little congested, the nurse took her to her office and masked her and sent her home immediately. She went to the Doc.....got the swab, and 4 days later the test results were positive for swine. She was never really bed ridden...........symptoms werent really terrible at all. Shes better and cleared to go back to school. Another neice now has it, and said she went to the doctor and they didnt even test her..........they said H1N1.........go home and rest and stay home from school. i find that strange, Id like to know if i have swine flu or regular flu if i go in for a check up.  I dont have numbers  down here but ive only known these 2 family members that have been diagnosed with it. Heard thru the grapevine that lots are out of school though.

397430,charlesn,2009-10-29 14:11:00,551,"1 thing to consider about statistics.  They can be misleading if not taken in context.  Sure lots of people die from the regular flu every year.  But how many otherwise healthy young strong people die from it.  A large percentage or virtually none? That is what seems to be scary about this strain is that it can kill people that are otherwise young and strong and healthy.  I guess I should be happy that I am becoming old and infirm.  I'm going to get the shots for sure to try to protect my little kids, but on the fence as to whether they should or not.  Will probably rely on the pediatrician's advice for that one.  Scary that they had to ""rush"" the vaccine, but at the same time, what use will the vaccine be to us next fall...  Complicated world we live in.  As to the original question, my wife, 3 year old and 16 month old have all been sick for 2 weeks, I have been sick for 11 days with the worst of it appearing to be behind all of us.

People want to make money and want to make money over night.  A relative of mine also contracted the west nile virus. Half her body was paralized and she was in a coma. She's ok now but still....There is no way the west nile virus could have gotten here if it wasn't introduced. It is not contagious.  Even though my daughter has the swine flu? Still dont believe it is a threat on the scale the media paints it out to be. Could these people have introduced this virus to make a buck? Do you think people are expendable when it comes to making money? If you ask these war generals, they will say yes. I may sound a bit cinical, but I've seen enough to know the level of corruption that exists in our society.  I'm curious to see how many others have contracted this desease at my daughter's school. So far, no one in her family, or anyone else that has been around her has contracted the desease. How does that work if it is so contagious? And how is it that healthy kids are dying and others not? Different strains? If there is a vaccine, maybe they should get a vaccine that protects against the stronger strains.  I wonder how many people will die from side effects of the vaccine? Not that you will ever hear about it. If you are an elderly or have a new born living with you, than that is fine....Other than that? I wouldn't advise it."
