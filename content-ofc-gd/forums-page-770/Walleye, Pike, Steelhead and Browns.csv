I do know that all here at OFC better get prepared for another late fall onslaught of chrome from the one and only... SOLOPADDLER!!!  Can't get bored of looking at the bows you catch... and there's always so many of them too.
396654,Mike the Pike,2009-10-27 02:51:00,3421,Another great mixed bag of a report.I enjoyed the tale of the cement swimming pool.  Nice new motor what ever happened to the Honda 40HP?  MTP

396683,StoneFly,2009-10-27 04:21:00,574,"Great Report,....thats it, Im gettin my passport,...lol...as much fun as we have up here it can be hit and miss,...had the weirdest expeience this past weekend with spooked fish, but then again if we could see them they could see us.  Wish I had a better camera of the 4 x 6-12lb browns I saw hiding under a log jam and the 40 or so 12-14"" that were in there with them, not too mention in another spot the 20 chromers just watching us and as uninterested as spooked nookies....  The best part of your story was about the Swimming pool,...no matter what the most addicted of us do for these fish its nothing compared to what we will do for the woman we love.  Its game on from here on  Rain Gods,..one more"
396693,Spiel,2009-10-27 09:28:00,9065,Great post Mike.  I'll have to hook up with you for some action on this river with you....    It looks like a great place to break in my new baitcast outfit. Unfortunately it'll have to be next fall.
396700,solopaddler,2009-10-27 11:01:00,8605," I don't really know Simon, it's weird. It's not that I've taken him out all that much, he's still too young. I think he just sees dad constantly fishing and wants to emulate me..     Looking forward to it!    Drew, we should get something arranged soon.    Albert, I've been meaning to call you. When conditions are prime we've got to get out together!    Well worth getting the passport..but the better fishing has actually been north this year.    Still on the mend? There's plenty of easier access places y'know.   Thanks everyone for the comments!  Cheers"

396432,solopaddler,2009-10-26 14:45:00,8605,"I've been fishing like mad the last 3 weeks. Havn't had much time to post proper reports as beyond being busy my compter has been down for a while. In any case I figured I'd combine a few of my recent trips into one report.    Walleye/Pike And A Mans Love For A Woman   Thanksgiving weekend I closed the cottage and managed to squeeze in a days fishing with my dad and uncle on my favourite back lake. Fishing with 3-4"" live shiners on a simple Lindy rig in 30' of water we scratched out a bunch of decent fish:      We kept 3 of them and enjoyed a perfect shore lunch:        Doesn't get any better than that and it was a perfect capper to the cottage season.  On the way back across my uncles lake he told us an interesting tale. Apparantly back in the late 40's, early 50's a gentleman from southern ON aquired a lease and built a cottage on an island. His wife was crippled and loved to swim but because of the rocky nature of the shoreline was unable to. Not wanting his better half to suffer the man built a concrete swimming pool on the island. Even more amazing was how he supplied it with water. A km up on the hill across from his camp is a tiny spring fed lake. He ran a water line all the way from the lake, down the hillside, under the water over to his island. Need clean, cold water? No problem, just turn on the tap!  We went over to the island to investigate. Supposedly his better half passed away in the late 60's. The lease expired and the mnr went in and tore the camp down.  The old dock pilings and path to the cottage are still visible:    There were no signs of the camp but the concrete pool was still in great shape. There were trees growing up through it, but it was still quite intact:    I thought it was a great story...    The Fall Steelhead Season Begins  With conditions being prime almost everywhere, both north and south, I've been racking up the miles on the truck. Here's a handful of pic's from a variety of locations including some scenery shots from what I consider to be steelhead paradise.                                      My Favourite October Moment   My son just turned 3 this month. His entire interests revolve around fishing. Me? I'm amazed and cautiously optimistic. My wife Joanne just rolls her eyes. LOL!  When asked what kind of birthday party he wanted he said ""Fishing party!"" What kind of cake? ""Fishing cake!"" What kind of presents? ""Fishing!!"" What do you want to be for Halloween? ""A Fisherman!!"" Every night at bedtime he runs into my room and grabs one of my fishing mag's from a stack. That's what he insists I read to him for a bedtime story. If I'm not around he forces Jo to do the same much to her amusement.   I've had him out a couple of times without much success. Recently however we launched the boat locally and tried our hands at some browns. He picked out the lure himself and did a pretty fair job helping to reel the fish in:     That's my boy!   Things are swinging into high gear now, the next month should be as good as it gets.   Cheers,  Mike"

396477,solopaddler,2009-10-26 16:29:00,8605, Why not? I could write an essay on the topic. At this point I think I'll let it ride.
