397472,ADB,2009-10-29 16:21:00,444,"Stumbled upon this sale at Gagnon's.  $89.99 for a Mustang 1505 Classic Coat.  http://www.gagnonsports.com/clearouts.html  At Le Baron we sell it for $185.94, so that is quite the deal.  For those looking for an inexpensive option, you won't find much better than that."
397476,sully,2009-10-29 16:30:00,40,"NICE FIND, but being green means its not coast guard approved and you'll need another in the boat as it will not qualify as a life jacket come time when the ministry boys or OPP check..."
397482,ADB,2009-10-29 16:45:00,444,"If I remember correctly, only true Life Jackets have to be red, orange, or yellow to meet code. PFD's can be any colour, as long as they are worn properly, etc."
397544,Fisherman,2009-10-29 20:52:00,7201,Better check the regs then..cause the camo suits do come with CCG and DOT approval.
397547,Roy,2009-10-29 21:15:00,13728,"As far as I know, only standard life jackets need to be either yellow, orange or red. The terms are confusing. A standard life jacket is the kind that you'll generally find on commercial vessels and those found on cruise boats and ferries (usually hanging from the ceilings). Most people don't own those types. The general boating/fishing public use PFDs or float jackets. These can be of any colour as long as they are approved by the governing authority."
397617,ADB,2009-10-30 00:00:00,444,"Thanks for the confirmation, Roy."
397951,brkygetr,2009-10-31 00:17:00,425,Either way its a Mustang..you float when you fall through the ice....and that my friends is critical to your survival. If you walk like Jesus you should wear a suit or a coat.
397962,redneck666,2009-10-31 00:47:00,563,"i agree with the floatation suit idea, and by the way that is a great find! but i've been through the ice a couple times, and have made it out fine and dandy (not to be rude or anything).. and i sure hope i didnt jinx myself for the upcoming season!"
