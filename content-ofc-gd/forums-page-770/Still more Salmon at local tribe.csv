I left by 9:30pm as soon as it got crowded.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing066.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing067.jpg   Surprise to know the Salmon are still coming into the area even if the weather temp was warmer than average. It was southeast wind last night.  I got skunk 2 night ago fishing for 1.5 hours."
