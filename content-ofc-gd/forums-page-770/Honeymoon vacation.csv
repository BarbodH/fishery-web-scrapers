I'm looking for a semi secluded cottage with hot tub and boat. If possible on a calm lake (hopeing on getting the soon to be wife out on a boat fishing).  Everytime I take her out we haven't had the best of luck. We are planning on June, I don't know if I can get a place that dosen't have much bugs around.... not a big problem but will go further north if we have to. If anyone has any info that would be great. Thanks for taking the time to read this.  Luke"
