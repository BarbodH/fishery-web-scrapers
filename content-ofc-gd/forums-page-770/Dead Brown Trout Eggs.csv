398041,xKobeZx,2009-10-31 03:53:00,10,I was fishing at the hamilton harbour earlier today and found a dead female brown trout.It was still very reconizable and didnt look like it had been dead very long so i decided to see if it had some eggs and did it ever anyways i took them and stored them properly but was wondering if they're anygood seeing as they came from a dead fish. Any input would be greatly appreciated thanks.
398043,l2p,2009-10-31 04:06:00,346,no difference.... although carefull out there when taking eggs from a dead fish cause if the co comes by and sees u with eggs and no fish then u will be worrying about a real problem!
398052,xKobeZx,2009-10-31 06:00:00,10,Is it frowned upon taken them from dead fish? If so i wouldnt have done it i just figured its dead so why not.
398070,DMASSE,2009-10-31 11:53:00,420,"HEY BUD  Its totally ok to harvest eggs from a dead fish,  Personally I have done it with dead ( not to old) coho's, and pacifics)    I asked Mitch the CO in Durham  about it and he said that its cool, but the baggy will count towards the daily limit...  better to harvest eggs from a fish that is dead than milk the crap out of a live fish or worsr kill her for the eggs.....  Dave"
398073,solopaddler,2009-10-31 11:59:00,8605,Agree with Dave. Many times over the years that's exactly how I've harvested my own eggs. As long as the fish is recently deceased and it's eggs aren't rotting there's nothing wrong with it. In fact the practice should be encouraged.

398111,bigfish1965,2009-10-31 14:39:00,3382,Just do not harvest the eggs of a fish where that fish is not in season.

Funny thing is, the pool I was fishing was full of snaggers that day. Not one of them thought to harvest a dead fish.  Like others have said, as long as the fish is in decent shape, the roe should be fine."
