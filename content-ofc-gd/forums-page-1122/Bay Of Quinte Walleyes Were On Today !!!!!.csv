132678,007,2007-11-12 03:53:00,537,Good job guys - congrats on all those big fish.  Nice to see what lures you were using too - I got some of those but never had the chance to use them.  Were the baitfish and walleye suspended or near bottom?  007

132805,fishindevil,2007-11-12 15:41:00,6254,"Yes the fish were very spooky,with all the boat traffic,i tried to stay well away from them,and you could see the walleyes streaking down to deeper water it was only a few times where you could see them comming up for a look,and as the day went on the walleyes went deeper in an attempt,to get away from the shadows caused by the boats....."
