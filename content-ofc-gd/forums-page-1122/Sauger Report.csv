The sauger and hybrid striper  fishing should be picking up as the weather cools down here on the ohio river.  I let the fish go. This was the only one that i caught but i guess it was better then not fishing.  "

132798,mattyk,2007-11-12 15:10:00,2110,i caught it in the ohio river. There are so many of them here in the ohio. I think the daily limit is 10 and i see so many people taking 10 fish home every time they are out.
