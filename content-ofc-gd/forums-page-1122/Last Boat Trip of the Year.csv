After being tossed around and soaked out in the lake with nothing to show for our efforts besides a ton of floating vegetation, we moved into some sheltered canals to target the panfish which were plentiful in them. We had a good day and went home with 12 decent perch, the rest were released. The trip back home was brutal though even though the lake had flattened a bit.          "

132757,pikehunter,2007-11-12 13:51:00,1659,"Don't blame you for deciding that is it for the year. A cold nasty and not so productive day like that can help make that decision. I know it's a tough choice to make and a sad one indeed, but the boat has to be put to rest eventually. Until next season that is!"
