Now I just found out i'll be heading to Montreal for training before the end of the month.  Looks like musky season is open just a little bit longer, so hopefully i'll have a chance to get one! Any of you Monstealers looking for a fishing partner in a couple weeks?  I may check out the Mepps factory while im in town!"
