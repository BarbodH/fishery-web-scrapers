132192,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-10 16:24:00,2585,i think he should be!  while he was healthy he was the most dominate all round player player i have ever seen.  when a pyhsical player like a wendal clark/cam neely or and eric lindros play there game there career is only going to last 7 or 8 good years.  There body cant take it.  If eric played like jagr he would still be in the top ten in scoring every year.  his playing record for canada speaks for itself!  minus the Bull he put quebec through he has been a class act his whole career.  ALways doing charity work and promoting the game.  the 5 million he dontated on thursday is the side most people dont know about lindros.  Cheers!
132215,kickingfrog,2007-11-10 19:28:00,8333,"  You said ""tons"". I see 5 names. Anderson has been retired 10 years? He's not in yet, but he might. He was a very clean player ;-) Ciccarelli has been eligible for the hall for 5 years maybe? He might get in. He won the Lady Byng like a half dozen times didn't he? Gilmour darn near always lead his teams in fewest penalty minutes ;-)  All three had good/great careers and may all make it to the HHoF, that doesn't then infer that Lindros is undeserving. Goalies are difficult to compare to skaters.  Lindros was the dominate force when on the ice. Many deserving members of the HHoF can't have that said about them.  I hated Lindros the player. Not liking a player should have very little, if any, baring on being in the HHoF. Not liking a player has everything to do with being a fan. The two need to be kept separate.  Stated again: Federco, Gillies, MacDonald and Neely are in already."
132216,kickingfrog,2007-11-10 19:29:00,8333,  Bet he can't remember all the good fishin' holes.
132346,chickenhawk,2007-11-11 06:23:00,612,Lindros is a plug! Gave a nice generation to a good cause though I will give him that! But still a cry baby plug of a hockey player but not as bad as Kaspiritis.   Hawk
132469,kennyman,2007-11-11 16:23:00,737,"I hated the fact that he wouldn't play for the team he was drafted by (even though it was Quebec). I thought they should never let him in the NHL after that. BUT,  think back everyone to how amazing this guy was as a player. Imagine being the opposition. It's 1992, you're in the Broadstreet bullies homerink. You're in the corner with the puck, you look over your shoulder and see this guy coming at you .... yikes!!! When he was healthy he was great. He would mow down anything in his path. Even better, when he put on the red and white jersey and played for team Canada he gave it his all. Don't get me wrong,I'm not giving him all the credit, but him being on the Canadian juniors when we won gold in 91 was not just coincidence. He really gained my respect over the years every time he put on that jersey. You could really see the passion for the game in his eyes. Anyway, I never liked him at first, but he won me over."

131853,fishindevil,2007-11-09 14:38:00,6254,"Well read kickingfrogs post all his best acomplishments were before he turnes 19...his record speaks for itself.....he did get a gold medal,and all those other awards before the NHL....its a tough call????if only he had learned to skate with the puck with his head up"
131861,suds,2007-11-09 15:01:00,70,"Yes, he belongs in the Hall of Fame for what he accomplished while playing hockey. Period end of story.  I think a lot of the debate is centred around his ""unrealized potential"". But most NHL'ers  could not post the points and get the awards he got in 20 years, never mind the 7 good ones he had.  Its the hockey hall of fame, not the nice personality hall of fame.  cheers suds"
131883,Mike Pike,2007-11-09 16:24:00,1332,"Ya, I agree with Suds.  I saw a brilliant piece on TSN this morning and the reporter said Eric shouldn't be judged buy what WE expected of him.  I think his stats alone put him in the Hall.  Beyond that, I thought his 5-million dollar donation to the London hospital and retirement announcement was terrific."
131887,Kirk,2007-11-09 16:36:00,347,"Definitely YES.  He easily more than earned it in the first 1/2 of his career and you don't lose entitlement to the HOF because of injuries.  He was a superstar and, unlike Gretzky, he didn't have special NHL unwritten rules for marketing and promotion protecting him.  He should also get in just for putting up with Bobby Clarke's Bull  Kirk"
131904,ehg,2007-11-09 17:17:00,2666,"To some extent i say yes as well. He could score when healthy, but was impressed a couple of years ago when he was with Rangers, (after 8 concussions) Lindros got into a fight with Joe Thorton (w/Bruins) and absolutely pummelled Thorton. Maybe even knocked him out, can't remember.  Hall of famer when healthy.   ehg"
131931,walleyejigger,2007-11-09 18:41:00,876,"NO, he's a bum and cry baby, the moment he refused to play for the nordiques he should have been banned from the nhl"
131947,JohnF,2007-11-09 20:17:00,3494," Being a prima dona didn't make him a less skilled player, and I think someone else also mentioned that some of that nonsense was Mom and Pop playing agent, and not really doing him any favours image-wise in the process. I stand by what I said earlier that he played like a big (very tough) man who happened to be very skilled as well, and without the benefit of a bodyguard and unwritten rules protecting him. I think because he could play big and tough it wasn't good business to keep him out of the heavy going, especially in Philly in those days. They built the most succesful franchise in the league, business-wise, by selling that toughness to the fans. He handled the bruising, give and take, and still played like an all-star.  He still gets my vote. He might even have got my vote back in the six team league days.  JF"
131948,spanky,2007-11-09 20:22:00,195,"YES, i don't think i can recall a player who had the speed, power, skill, toughness and soft hands like the Big E did... i personally enjoyed watching Lindros more than Gretzky and Lemiuex, and almost as much as the Moose  seems most of the people saying no are using his off ice antics as a reason... well alot of NHL players do horrible things off ice that look bad on themselves and the league, based solely on his accomplishments he should be in the HHOF imo"

131986,bassman,2007-11-09 22:24:00,384,  Neely never won a cup. He was with Vancouver and Boston.
132031,holdfast,2007-11-10 00:49:00,1813,"Just checking on his stats and the arguments here so far, I think I would agree with the Minority and say yes, he should be in the Hall of Fame.  But like a lot of things it seems, if politics are involved, Id say he has no chance.  I'm not a Toronto Fan, so he never disappointed me as I am, or was a Habs Fan and all I know is how he totally dominated and set the pace in the World Juniors and NHL.  As a Team sport Id say he was one quarter of that team.  Four lines, His Line had the opposition hiding.  When Philly played Mtl his line Made Mtls Line look like Team France if you know what I mean.  In his short NHL Career He Had more points than games.  Yes and he is a two way player no doubt about it.  As far as playing with Quebec, If I had a choice I wouldn't of want to.  As far as Clarke, It seems to me it all started when he had a concussion and he was forced to play that started the problems.  As far as playing for TO, Just like Mtl when they traded Chelios for Savard a bad move.  Blame the Management not the player as they are hoping to get a cheap washed out super star.  Here's a link to his stats.  If Neely is in the Hall of Fame, Lindros should be http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/players/data08/00003158.html"

132085,ecxstriper,2007-11-10 03:26:00,343,The funniest thing is that Philly gave up Peter Forsberg in the trade and had Lindros played for the Nordiques he would have been on a much better team in the end . LOL
132091,Rizzo,2007-11-10 03:49:00,4754,"borderline imo, but based on some others that have somehow got in there, I think he will too"
132092,holdfast,2007-11-10 03:50:00,1813,"Umm Agree, then he might of ended up with the leafs instead of SunBeam.  I wonder how he would of done then  HEALTHY"
132095,KyleM,2007-11-10 03:52:00,218," Your kidding, right?  For starters.....  Glenn Anderson and Mr Ciccarelli....... How can you forget Gilmour? There are also arguements for old Flames blocker Mike Vernon.   I dont like him for a number of reasons, being dirty just added to it. There are some dirty players in the HHOF (ofcourse) but they had much better numbers then Lindros.  What about Bill Ranford??????  Have you looked at the stats?"
132103,Rizzo,2007-11-10 04:05:00,4754, dirtiest player I ever saw play the game.  Don't dare check him or you'll get a stick in the mouth just before you hit him.
132120,scuro,2007-11-10 05:21:00,386,I heard he bought a fishing lodge in Quebec. Perhaps a group of OFNers could head up there this summer?
131648,holdfast,2007-11-08 22:36:00,1813,Heard this morning that Lindros is Retiring.  The Radio announcer stated that Bob Clarke of all people said that he should be in the Hall of Fame.  I know he's been an impact player and has had what? eight concussions.  I enjoyed watching him play in his early days especially the World Juniors and wished that he would of played for MTL.  But a Hall of famer? whats your take?
131650,outdoorguy61,2007-11-08 22:44:00,220,"He was a good player but injured too often to make a difference.  ""No""  outdoorguy61"

131658,lilkynan,2007-11-08 22:57:00,173,"These days - almost anyone gets in - even ones the never played for the NHL  I don't think he contributed to the game, therefore should not be in, but he will..."
131660,JohnF,2007-11-08 22:59:00,3494," Definitely. I never liked him. Thought he was a whiney jerk, but he may be the greatest all round player to play the game yet ... big, strong, fast, smart, and great hands, but what sets him apart was toughness. He probably wouldn't have had those concussions if he hadn't stuck his nose (and body) into a lot of spots other superstars fear to tread, or had had a cadre of bodyguards and a set of unwritten rules to protect him. They were talking about him the other night on the game and I guess they were pretty persuasive. I'm sold anyway.  JF"
131662,Cory,2007-11-08 23:00:00,170,He is already in the Dr. Karen Johnston hall of fame
131663,kickingfrog,2007-11-08 23:06:00,8333,"It is the hockey hall of fame, not the NHL. 2 gold medals at the world juniors. Canada cup champion Memorial cup champion Olympic silver medal (and later a gold medal) Then he turned 19  In the NHL he was a dominate hockey player for many years, many players in the hall can not have that said about them. Yes, his career was not what it could have been because of injuries, but the same can be said of Orr and Lamieux, two great players that clearly deserve to be in the hall, but the fact is that injuries, and cancer in Lamieux's case, impacted on their ability to perform at their best for parts of their careers.  Many of the arguments as to why he shouldn't be in are in regards to things off the ice, and I don't feel that should have much (if any) baring on his inclusion to the hall.  He had an ""issue"" with the owner of the Nordics not the french people. That same owner then sold Lindros to two teams, he was awarded to the Flyers not the Rangers in court. Abeu (the owner of the Nordics) then shipped his team to Colorado.  Here are some of the other members of the hall: Federco, Gillies, Mullen, Goulet, MacDonald and Neely."
131666,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 23:11:00,7971,"I'd say no.  I liked him as a player.  He was dominating when he was on his game, but I don't think he ever played an entire season did he?  I may be wrong there.  He wasn't consistent enough in my opinion to get into the Hall."
131670,PAZE,2007-11-08 23:40:00,132,"Many of you say no, I say yes he has done way more them most.  Named to NHL All-Rookie Team - 1993 Hart Memorial Trophy - 1995 Lester B. Pearson Award - 1995 Bobby Clarke Trophy - 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999 Played in 6 All-Star Games - 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 Won Olympic Silver Medal with Team Canada in 1992 Winter Olympic Games Won Olympic Gold Medal with Team Canada in 2002 Winter Olympic Games  That there is enough if you ask me.  Paul"
131671,crappieperchhunter,2007-11-08 23:50:00,2582,"He had greatness, no doubt. But from my point of view never showed enough of it in any kind of a sustained manner....which to me is the #1 measure of a Hall of Famer. I would vote no. Plus he was one of the dirtiest players I have ever seen with his stick, which I think is the reason he got his bell rung so often. Seems NHL'ers wouldn't let him spear them in the groin or the calves like he got away with here in Oshawa playing against small boys in junior hockey."
131674,Dutch,2007-11-08 23:54:00,831,"He averaged over a point a game.  Won awards, as mentoined above.  Compare his accomplishments to a guy like Cam Neely - who is in the HOF - pretty tough not to put Lindros in.  I don't think he will get it in 3 years when he is first eligible, but he will get in eventually.  Granted, Neely won Stanley Cups (I think), but last I checked that is not a prerequisite.  Nor is the amount of injury time....  I vote yes."
131682,Zib,2007-11-09 00:16:00,369,"He's a Hall of Fame cry baby that when he wasn't hurt, choked in the big games."
131720,pigeonfisher,2007-11-09 01:26:00,696,I believe all MVP's (hart trophy) are in the hall of fame.  No exception here.
131726,danc,2007-11-09 01:55:00,4677,"I think that it was his parents that ruined his career. They were his agents. Nope. Not signing with the Nordiques. We'll sit out and see what happens. Philly grabs him and he shows his talent. Mom and Pop jump in again and next thing we know is that Bobby Clarke can't get rid of him soon enough, despite his talent. Sad story really. The guy had size and incredible talent. But I think that Mom and Pop pushed too many buttons. Sure, his history of concussions didn't help. But throughout his career, he was in no mans land. His parents (agents) demanded too much for their prize possession. Their winning lottery ticket got lost in the washing machine. Eric was awesome. But poor managing and some bad luck cost him his career. Hall of fame? No, in my opinion."
131744,kickingfrog,2007-11-09 02:39:00,8333,You're right. He did want out of Philly. The doctors almost killed him. And that has nothing to do with HHF nominations.
131756,KyleM,2007-11-09 03:38:00,218,"He wont get in anytime soon.   There are a ton of better players that will be going in before dirty old double digit.  He is a dirty player, cry baby to boot."
131766,Pigeontroller,2007-11-09 04:29:00,2793,He's giving 5 million to the London hospital...Pretty generous donation.
131771,charlied,2007-11-09 05:26:00,584,if there is a hall of fame for concussions maybe.  Man he was my favourite player in 1990 draft...still have his rookie cards...what a dissapointing career for such a young talent at the time.
131775,snoil,2007-11-09 09:53:00,139,YES.Like him or not he was a dominate player WHEN healthy.Averaged over 1.3 points a game in the NHL. One of the best junior players EVER.Fisrt time ballot.
131778,ecxstriper,2007-11-09 11:25:00,343,"I hated him since day one , and if he makes it in I lose all respect of the HHoF. I lived in Philly when he came there so I got to see and hear the drama on a  daily base . Favorite Lindros moment was the  the Scott Stevens hit during the playofffs."
131792,kickingfrog,2007-11-09 12:43:00,8333," Name 'em.  That's right, it's the paddy cake hall of fame and doesn't have any ""dirty"" players in it.  I know, players like Messier and Clarke weren't dirty, they just played with passion and heart."
131793,Crazyhook,2007-11-09 12:45:00,1154,hey he lead the League in scoring and concussions a few different seasons!
