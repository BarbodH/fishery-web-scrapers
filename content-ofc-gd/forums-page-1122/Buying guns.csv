132282,DT10Sam,2007-11-11 01:59:00,480," Hi Taper,  Couldn't help but see this thread and I can answer your question and it is Yes I ship clear across Canada.  If there is something that you would like let me know and I will see what I can do for you.  As far as used guns I am almost completely sold out of them all.  Thanks TJ for expressing your personal experience.  Best regards, Sam"
