I fished for an hour with nothing untill I decided id practice my long distance release on a nice male bow. Fishing heated up for about an hour after that with some small trout caught, but nothing worth taking a picture of. My float went down on a drift and FINALLY some weight on the other end of the line, but wait it doesnt feel like a bow. Nope, definatly not a bow but not heavy enough to be a salmon, what is it? A big FAT female brown. Exactly what I was looking for.  Didnt put up much of a fight, but the roe sure looks good in my fridge. I was kinda surprised that she was still around and full of eggs, I usually dont get browns this far into november.  Sorry about the crappy picture, cell phone camera and the fish would not sit still so shes pretty dirty.    Looks like a good match for this guy, that I caught earlier this season. "
132260,Clampet,2007-11-10 23:48:00,1947,Wow! Nice size! 
132261,krawler,2007-11-10 23:52:00,167,"What were you using for bait?  and about what time did you catch her?  sometimes the fish bite when the water warms up a little.  nice catch, hope to get into some tomorrow."
132264,mattyk,2007-11-11 00:52:00,2110,nice brownie!
132299,Milty,2007-11-11 03:11:00,121,Nice catch...but even nicer egg supply for the season....
132322,ccmtcanada,2007-11-11 04:20:00,7971,Great job Kemper!  I was out at a local trib yesterday (Friday) mid afternoon...took a look at the water and also couldn't believe how low and clear it was considering the rains the day before.  I only spent 40 minutes drifting in pools I knew there were no fish in....cause I could see all the way to the bottom....LOL.
132395,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 12:26:00,8163,Beauty fish!!!... how did it taste?
132558,kemper,2007-11-11 22:17:00,2232,"Wonderful, actually. I was somewhat surprised because I have never eaten a brown, and this one was larger than any other trout that I have kept. If Im keeping a trout for the table it is usually 3-5 pounds. This was was closer to 9 -10.  By the way, I tied up 200 roe bags in clear, red and my new favourite blue (yes, blue) today. Roe is MINT."
132564,solopaddler,2007-11-11 22:52:00,8605,Nice brownies bud......or should I say atlantics?
132665,kemper,2007-11-12 03:02:00,2232,"actually if you look its a brown because there are nine black spots on the gillplate, three and a quarter orange spots on the belly and the tail has 8 horzontal lines of brownish spots all with 9 spots in them.  thanks guys!  now we just need some water, I WANT SOME STEEL!"
