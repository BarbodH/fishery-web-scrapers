132394,Rich Clemens,2007-11-11 12:26:00,3131,"Mr. Twister.  My wife and I visit Rideau Ferry every July and have for the past 8-9 years, primarily for bass  (Maple Crest Motel and Cabins).  The camp owner knows I make trips to the French each year for musky.  He keeps saying there are musky in the Rideau and that I don't have to drive all the way to the French.  He keeps telling me I need to take some time and try for some skis on the Rideau.  Unfortunately, there aren't any in the area that we visit - that I know of.   Looks like I'll need to do a bit of homework and just see where these girls live and give it a shot some time.  Won't be up in July this year, due to a change in plans, but maybe in September.  That is one very nice ski and my hat's off to you."
