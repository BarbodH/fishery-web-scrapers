Saturday:Started out saturday morning at 6:30am, trekked until I found a nice area. about 7-8 people in the area. very spread out.. about 2 hrs later  I hooked into my first steelhead of the year, a nice 3lbs.    then my 2nd not 45 minutes later...    I love the self pics!  decided to call it a morning. went home had some lunch, headed back to the same spot around 2pm. not a soul in the area. Landed my 3rd of the day around 4 pm.  this time i tried to camera timer..    Sunday: met up w/ m buddy nelson, i phoned him saturday night told him about my sucess and he was on his way the next morning. the day started out slow, missed a few hits.. froze my ass off, man is that water cold.. got all wamred up when i hooked into my 4th of the weekend , 1st of the day.    I bring the fish in and look back to where i caught my fish and theres nelson, nabbing my spot lol... So i moved down to where he was, not 20 minutes later, my 2nd of the day. a nice 8lb 3oz steelhead..
