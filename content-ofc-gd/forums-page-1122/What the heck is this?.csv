132604,DT10Sam,2007-11-12 00:53:00,480,"With all of my years experience in taxidermy I have mounted both Brown's and Atlantic's.  That fish is definitely a Brown Trout in fall colors.  The males will get a hooked mouth in the fall and that male has a hooked mouth which is a little more than normal.   Regards, Sam"
132605,Nater,2007-11-12 00:54:00,68,gotta leave it open till the results from mnr are in...aniceguy is affiliated with mnr and he beleives that it is a brown so I'd have to say his input is as good as any other form the mnr but interesting to see what Dmasse's buddies come up with tommorow
132607,KyleM,2007-11-12 00:55:00,218,"Yep, cant remember the last time people talked to eachother like that on this board.  Should be a great winter of reading if these guys start flowing in!  Take Brandons advice"
132614,Rich,2007-11-12 01:02:00,3927,"Trust me this trib is open year round for trout. I'm not going to name it. It's a small spot and gets enough pressure as it is. I refuse to fish it in the day time anymore as it's always full of people .. there is one legal spot to fish, the rest are trespassing. On boathouses, bridges, private property. It's kinda sick really."

132644,Roy,2007-11-12 02:12:00,13728,"Ok, settled then. It's a brat tralmon. Only caught by folks who thrive on shock value in their threads. We'll wait for a definititive answer from OMNR. Dang, I hope they still have internet service."
132587,Nater,2007-11-12 00:08:00,68,Well ehg seeing as the atlantic in your picture seems to have three and ONLY 3 black spots take a look at rich's fish yet again.  I see WAY more than 3 black dots on the gill cover/ head region.  Be interesting to see what Dmasse's mnr connections have to say and weather or not he chooses to post if they confirm it as a brown.  Alot of seasoned river fisherman on this site have cleary Identified this fish as a brown but we'll see and IF  it is confirmed that it is a brown then may you bite your tongue and retract your last statement above.  Nate  I dont seem to be the only one who firmly beleives it is a brown...funny how you like to choose favourites
132591,brandon,2007-11-12 00:14:00,857,oh snap nater's posse is here.......hey Rowbotham.......take the pic into SSFC and get Preslie to look at it......him or Mcgee.....they should know what it is
132595,ehg,2007-11-12 00:30:00,2666,:blahblah1:  :blahblah1:  Oh and it's 'whether' not 'weather'.  'i'before 'e' (except after 'c' ) as well. You can't spell so much for your opinion as well.
132597,irishfield,2007-11-12 00:32:00,26272,Rich...have you buried the evidence yet?
132599,Nater,2007-11-12 00:43:00,68,"If we are on the topic of spelling, I beleive God is spelt with a capital G  ."
132600,Burtess,2007-11-12 00:47:00,901,I went through the thread and took a count (should be good to within a couple points):  Brown Trout:  24  Atlantic Salmon:  7  Brown Trout Hybrid:  2  Rock Bass:  1  Splake:  1  So far Rich is staying out of jail.......  Burt
132343,KyleM,2007-11-11 05:47:00,218,"Rich, must be that drinking water!  FRIG, get with the damn program rich.  Rockbass for sure."
132344,chickenhawk,2007-11-11 06:03:00,612,Definately an Atlantic Salmon. 100%
132350,Darrell,2007-11-11 06:27:00,27,"This just ticks me off, Why would you keep a fish if your not sure what it is ?????? My point is ""IF"" that is a atlantic salmon you just broke the law!!!! The current regs for Atlantic salmon season is Jan 1 - Sept 30."
132355,chickenhawk,2007-11-11 06:46:00,612,Come on man why is there always that guy that has to ruin it for everyone else?
132356,Fisherman,2007-11-11 06:52:00,7201,"Amen, well said."
132357,Darrell,2007-11-11 07:02:00,27," I dont think Im ruining this thread for everyone else, just making a valid point ""if you dont know what it is dont keep it!!!"""
132363,Photoz,2007-11-11 09:21:00,792,"Although I THOUGHT this was a brown trout, I 'GOOGLED' 'brown trout, which gave me what I THINK to be the twin of Rich's fish?  http://www.dnr.state.md.us/fisheries/art20...5browntrout.jpg  Then I 'GOOGLED' 'Atlantic salmon, here's what I came up with . . .   http://www.landbigfish.com/fish/fish.cfm?ID=104  If I knew how to do it, I'd cut & paste these photos into this thread . . . .      because I don't think Rich took an OOS Atlantic salmon, it sure looks a lot like a nice IN-SEASON brown trout to me? Nice fish Rich . . . .  . t'was the best I could come up with for you?"
132364,SlowPoke,2007-11-11 09:32:00,2984,    I think the trouble with Rich's fish is that it has the browns colours and tail but an atlantic jaw
132365,Photoz,2007-11-11 09:42:00,792,So o o  o  o  o . . . . .     would this make it a brownish salmon . . . . .    or an Atlantic trout?
132367,mattyk,2007-11-11 11:11:00,2110,nice fish! Looks like a brownie.
132371,Rich,2007-11-11 11:27:00,3927,I kept it because I assumed it was a chinook with funky colors. Now I believe it was a brown with a funky mouth.
132381,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 12:08:00,8163,It looks like an anemic Brown to me.
132393,Spiel,2007-11-11 12:24:00,9065,....I believe it is indeed a spawned out male brown.
132407,Moosebunk,2007-11-11 13:15:00,3970,"What I think is, that Rich isn't really sure and is easily swayed to agree with whatever, as long as it doesn't get him into too much trouble... but yet, still creates enough of a stir to keep him interested."
132411,Roy,2007-11-11 13:32:00,13728,I'm really surprised at how many are swaying on this one. It is a brown.
132414,bigfish1965,2007-11-11 13:43:00,3382,It is a male brown trout.
132415,Terry,2007-11-11 13:47:00,14456,I have no idea what it is  interesting thread
132417,bassfighter,2007-11-11 13:59:00,366,Brown Trout for sure. Book source from North American fishing club  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b...m/malebrown.jpg
132418,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 14:06:00,8163,What kind of fish is this?... if y'all are so smart! 
132425,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-11 14:29:00,835,Gater?
132433,Fish Farmer,2007-11-11 14:53:00,2234,"Greencoachdog Corn on the cob, fried Spud's, Fried fish, And does that look like Tomato chow chow, You are the MAN  . Some good eatin there! My vote, Brown Trout"
132435,Roy,2007-11-11 14:55:00,13728,So where's the pork hock and collard greens?
132439,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 15:05:00,8163," That is actually steamed yellow squash.   Roy  The ham hocks and collards were the night before, and the Pup gets all the leftovers... and when she wants ""out"" after eating collard greens, you'd better let her out quick!!!!"
132442,Ben_Daniels,2007-11-11 15:08:00,435,Thats a cool looking fish Rich...Whatever it is. Its always nice to catch something different. I heard some people talking down at the lake a couple days ago and I heard someone say that they are going to start stoking only Atlantic Salmon in Lake Ontario... didn't they already try that and it didn't work?Anybody know if theres any truth to this? That would be weird if those were the only salmon around...  -Ben
132445,redfin,2007-11-11 15:10:00,79,"Rich, Brown trout.  There are spots on the adipose fin (third picture down).  Atlantic adipose fin is unspotted. I have caught two Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario tribs few years back, one in Oshawa , one in Mississauga, neither one of them tagged."
132288,Rich,2007-11-11 02:41:00,3927,"Okay.. so I went steelheading today and all I managed was this mystery fish. I was sure it was a salmon, but after inspecting it closely I couldn't figure out what type of salmon. It was a male, and I kept it. The pics were taken after I took the guts out and it had laid on shore and bled out for probably an hour, but the coloration remained the same just a little lighter. After eating it this evening (it was delicious by the way) I know for a fact it was some type of salmon. I've just never seen a salmon with that kind of coloration. The weirdest part for me was getting a salmon that looked so fresh this late in the season. Maybe some OFC'ers can clarify my catch!        And the ever so famous, ""porch shot""  "
132291,pikeie,2007-11-11 02:58:00,380,im not sure but maybe could it be an atlantic salmon?? although ive never seen an atlantic before lol
132292,CRMC,2007-11-11 03:03:00,1,Looks like a Brown Trout to me Rich. Looks Delicious too. Great Catch
132293,danc,2007-11-11 03:03:00,4677,"I'd agree that it is an Atlantic, if it's a Salmon."
132294,Milty,2007-11-11 03:04:00,121,"Looks like some kinda weird brown trout hybrid,..strange lookin fish,..i hope somoene can identify it..did u eat it yet?  How did it taste ??  Way to go on the catch though,..how was the fight?  What were you using?..shoulda took pics b4 gutting it...probably best to take this baby out of the gene pool...lol,..but im not sure i would eat that or anything else from Lake O tribs...LOL"
132295,Guest skeeter99,2007-11-11 03:04:00,0,Sorry  I just think it is funny that you caught a fish out of lake O trib and you dont know what it is **AND THEN YOU ATE IT** LOL!!!!!   looks like a brown trout salmon hybrid ?
132296,Rich,2007-11-11 03:09:00,3927,"I ate it, it was delicious. Caught it on a roe bag bottom bounced and it was a Lake Erie trib.  I thought I knew it was a salmon when I kept it.. didn't really think about the strange coloration until afterward. I was just too excited about the meal, LOL!  It fought like a champ, no jumps though.  Definitely not a trout though, I can tell by the taste of the meat, haha  Now I kinda feel guilty for keeping an atlantic.."
132298,Rich,2007-11-11 03:11:00,3927,"Well I just googled ""male atlantic salmon"" and boom, there it was. Definitely a male atlantic. Wow if that's how atlantic's taste I hope I catch more, LOL"
132301,steelhunter,2007-11-11 03:12:00,81,the fish is a brown trout lots of them inthe system now
132308,Nater,2007-11-11 03:22:00,68,Baffles me that you can fish rivers and not distinguish between a brown and an atlantic  Do they put something in the water you guys drink over there?  Nate
132309,steverowbotham,2007-11-11 03:24:00,1800,"it looks similar to a male atlantic and that was my intial thought, but judging by the tail, definitely a brown"
132314,SlowPoke,2007-11-11 03:51:00,2984,"Square tails are usually trout, brown in this case. Lakers are an exception to my trout rule, they tend to have a forked tail like salmon. I don't catch a lot of trout but I'd guess it's a brown. -Brian"
132320,Rich,2007-11-11 04:16:00,3927, No I just focus on more important species throughout the fishing season..
132323,douG,2007-11-11 04:20:00,2693,"We don't talk like that here,  Nate.  On the other hand, I'm with you.  I have no idea what kind of fish that is, either.  Baffled."
132325,DMASSE,2007-11-11 04:35:00,420,"THATS A ATLANTIC FOR SURE  WE LET ABOUT 300 GO LAST YEAR  ON WILMONT AND BOWMANVILLE  BY THE WAY NATE  SMOLT TO JUVINELE ALTALANTIC LOOKS THE SAME AS A BROWN..  NICE FISH,  we caught 2 last year  1 On the credit and another in bowmanville.  Both of mine were tagged.  Dave"
132327,danc,2007-11-11 04:44:00,4677,Interesting responses. So.... what is it? Atlantic or Brown? And why?
132329,Rich,2007-11-11 04:50:00,3927,Male Atlantic Salmon:    After some investigation on Google I'm also 100% sure it was a male atlantic. No tags either. I wasn't aware there was a stocking program on atlantics in Lake Erie.. any thoughts?
132330,steverowbotham,2007-11-11 04:55:00,1800,the tail says its a brown.
132331,irishfield,2007-11-11 04:59:00,26272,And why is that...it appears Atlantics have a square tail.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Salmo_s...rken_Norway.JPG  
132332,aniceguy,2007-11-11 04:59:00,1094,"there is no Atlantic stocking on Erie..its a brown and they are stocked in erie, in larger and larger numbers each year by the DEC.  The fish is not a hybrid or anything of the sorts just a brown in full spawn dress, with a worn out tail from being a repeat spawner  smolt to juvinile fish Atlantics have a different spot pattern and very different parr markings then a brown, the two fish in the natal stage of life are very easy to distinguish, to the angler not aware of the sometimes subtle but easily distinguisable markings and patterns migratory out of the lake browns and an Atlantic can sometimes be confused.  Atlantics are for the most part out of season in the stream environment while browns are'nt"
132333,Musky or Specks,2007-11-11 05:08:00,2710,"Gotta agre with brown trout here Lots of them stocked in Eire on the US side plus resident populations in Lynn,Big and Otter. Ive caught a lot in Big while steelheading."
132334,eyefish,2007-11-11 05:14:00,135,I too say a brown..no stocking of atlantics in erie at least I think so anyway
132335,Rich,2007-11-11 05:16:00,3927,Guess you had to taste it to know that it was not a trout.. lol  I've stopped caring. I now know what it was. Thanks for the help guys.
132339,danc,2007-11-11 05:22:00,4677," I don't know what it is honestly. We don't have either species up here. But... there is no Flounder stocking in Lake Superior, and one has been caught there."
132340,Milty,2007-11-11 05:22:00,121,Gotta be some kinda Hybrid...Brown/Atlantic...lol
