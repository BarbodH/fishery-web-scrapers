When I asked the boat mechanic where I bought a couple of years ago his answer was ""Oven cleaner."" I tried oven cleaner last year, it did work but still required some elbow grease. My problem with oven cleaner is that it is very corrosive and I would prefer to use something else. OC can't be too good for the painted surface after repeated use and what could any overspray do the the aluminum boats painted or bare finish? I kind of want to get everything all spic and span for winter storage and am greatful if anyone has any tips  Thanks."

Muriatic Acid 30% followed by a Baking Soda rub-down [ neutralizes the acid], wash down with warm soapy water,dry off , apply coat of oil with rag or brush.  some performance enthusiasts still do this with crankshafts when they rebuild the engines."
132312,pikehunter,2007-11-11 03:50:00,1659,Thanks for the ideas. The toilet bowl cleaner or Starbright sound like they could do the trick without being so caustic as oven cleaner.
132409,boatman,2007-11-11 13:15:00,350,Just make sure you don't allow any of the cleaners to run down the shaft and contact the rubber driveshaft seal. Remove the water pump and housing and wrap a rag or something around it before you start.
