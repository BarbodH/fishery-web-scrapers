We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.   We would personally like to thank each and every person that has served and/or given their life in the name of freedom and democracy. If it was not for the brave souls that protect us Life would not be the same as we know it.  Lest we forget.  The Aalbers family."

The suffering and attrition that those boys went through was unbelievable. For every Canadian that contributed to the war, it's something that should be remembered and respected... Thanks for posting."
