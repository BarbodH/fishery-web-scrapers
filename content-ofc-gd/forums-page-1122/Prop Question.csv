Also when I spin the prop it tends to rub on the housing a little at one point. There don't seem to be any play in the shaft side to side or up and down, but there is a little play in and out, is that normal? I know these sounds a little dirty but no other way to say it."

If the thrust washer wears that quickly, it would only mean that the new prop will rub more and more as use increases."

I know mine is and if you put it on the wrong way the prop will go on a bit further  I know merc thrust washers on newer engines are brass with a bevelled inside (that goes on shaft) there is a right and wrong way to put on"
