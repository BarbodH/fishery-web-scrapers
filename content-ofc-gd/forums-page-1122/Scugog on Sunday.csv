The water temp was pretty cold 39 degrees and there was ice forming in patches on the lake, these gulls were taking a rest on some.  this was the main bait I was going to use today (cast out and slow retrieve). I fished the Port Perry side for 2 hrs, then decided to fish just south of Cesarea, fished that area  for a couple of hrs and headed back to the west side for another hour and called it a day. No fish were landed but it was a learning experience (a cold one). "
