It is the VETERAN , not the poet, Who has given us freedom of speech. It is the VETERAN , not the campus organizer, Who has given us freedom to assemble. It is the VETERAN , not the lawyer, Who has given us the right to a fair trial. It is the VETERAN , not the politician, Who has given us the right to vote.    It is the VETERAN  , Who salutes the Flag,  It is the VETERAN  , Who serves under the Flag,  ETERNAL REST GRANT THEM O LORD, AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON THEM.  We can be very proud of our young men and women in the service no matter where they serve.  "

About our only call each year..but an important one for me.  Let us never forget those that served in all the wars and peace actions, as well as those that are currently serving to protect our rights and freedoms."
