Get the BGE up to temp, with some nice smoke action.      Set-up the Temp control complete with wireless beeper.      Of course, the Guru is the brains of the operation!      The wife claims that veggies are required, so....      5 hours later, the bad boy is ready.      Grab a blade and start hacking.     It was a tasty treat!    It's not as good as fishing, but what can you do.  "
