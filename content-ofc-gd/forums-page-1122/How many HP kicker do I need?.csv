132517,icefisherman,2007-11-11 20:45:00,952,"Yeah,  I know, I start looking more and more like Wayne #2 But this is why this forum is so great...all kinds of people with their personal experiences are always able and willing to guide in specific question like this one.  I know Wayne has bigger Lund and he has 9.9HP kicker on it.... Considering this, will 8HP be enough for 1700 Pro Sport? I'll be using it regularly for trolling and would like to count on it for emergency when/if the main motor dies on me.  8HP is cheaper but will it be enough for me? Appreciate you opinions before making a decision.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132519,irishfield,2007-11-11 20:49:00,26272,My 9.9 will push my Baron at 5.7 Mph Emil...an 8 will be plenty for your 1700 prosport.
132523,linweir,2007-11-11 20:54:00,202,A good 8 HP should be strong enough to push you boat even in so windy area like BOQ.
132526,icefisherman,2007-11-11 20:57:00,952,"Well,  It'll be 4 stroke kicker....9.9HP or 8HP...but 8HP will save me some money, so maybe this is the way to go based on what you told me.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132527,Dondorfish,2007-11-11 21:01:00,1000,"I put a 8 h.p. on my 22 foot Islander and it will push it at 4 and change mph into the wind ( at Quinte ), so you should have no problems with an 8 hp.   Don"
132530,Terry,2007-11-11 21:05:00,14456,I have  5 HONDA on my 16 foot deep V and my friend has the same motor on a 17 ft lund deep V boat and it does fine on both
132541,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 21:28:00,8163,  There's wind at the BOQ?... why wasn't I told of this earlier???
132546,Rizzo,2007-11-11 21:40:00,4754,"use paddles...cheap, good exercise and better for the environment (other than that I think 8 hp would be more than adequate)"
132548,PAZE,2007-11-11 21:42:00,132,"To have a kicker thats going to be all out while your trolling in heavy wind your better off running your big motor, now if your chasing walleye, or salmon, the 8 should be fine, if you chasing musky your better off going with the 9.9. Just dont under power it, in heavy chop days your motor will burn fuel harder then your main motor if its under powered. I would go with th 9.9  Paul"
132680,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-12 03:56:00,835,"Your not going to plain the boat with either of them so the top speed would be the same, the only difference would be how much more control you would get out of a bigger prop if they are not the same.  I run a 6hp on a 23', It will run it up to its hull speed all right and barely move at idle on a still day."
132684,Mike the Pike,2007-11-12 04:01:00,3421,Emil 8hp will be fine I am running 8hp on my 18 foot Lund.congrats on the new boat is it official.
