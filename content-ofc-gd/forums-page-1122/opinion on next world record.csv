131798,Jigger,2007-11-09 12:57:00,1237,This is a copy of a letter sent to Martin Williamson from Dr. John Casselman. Very interesting read.  http://www.muskie-fishing.ca/letter.asp
131826,BITEME,2007-11-09 13:54:00,1969,Ontario s next records  Lake Ontario- Wolf Island    Muskie Bay of Quinte Pickeral(Lake Ontario sort of) Lake Ontario  Toronto Island  Pike Lake Ontario  Toronto Island  Small Mouth Lake Ontario  Chinook Lake Ontario  Rainbow Trout Lake Ontario  Brown Trout Lake Ontario  Carp   What else is there
131844,fishindevil,2007-11-09 14:23:00,6254,"Thats a very interestingarticle,and lots if info,on the very good years of reporoduction...based on theose years when we had a strong el-nino....like weather patterns,thanks for sharing that....cheers"
131850,DANIMAL,2007-11-09 14:31:00,215,"-There have been musky cought in the st. Laurence with enough length but not girth. -There have been musky cought in Lake Erie with enough girth but not lenght. -Georgian bay seems to be somewere in the middle, and has coughed up 2 legitimate fish over 60lbs. -With global warming increasing the growth rate of warmwater species in northern climates, I think some of the large canadian shield lakes have a chance too.  I think any one of these could do it, but if I were to put my money on one, it would be georgian bay."
131871,capt bruce,2007-11-09 15:44:00,820,"Muskie records are the most disputed of all freshwater fish records , No ones mentioned the SPRAY fish 69 lb 11 ounce , claims he got in the Chippewa flowage , Art Lawton said he had a 69 lb 15 ounce from the St. Lawrence River ,Cal Johnson's muskie ,67-lb, 8-ounce ,Lac Courte Oreilles in Wisconsi.Like Marc says untill one over 61 lbs is caught and killed and stands up to all tests we are only guessing that one bigger even exsists. It would take ideal condistions over a number of years for a fish to grow this size . Time records are bassed on lengh and girth and forget the whole weight thing , Any muskie over 45 inches is a fish of a life time ."
131894,glen,2007-11-09 16:59:00,2641,In 1988 there was a lot more forage in Georgian bay.  There is not a world record fish in Georgian Bay right now.  (Wayne.  That CO don't know diddle.)  I think we need to pick a location based on food supply not the size of the water body.  Where is the best muskie food  :unsure:    ?  That is the question.  Who has the answer?
131908,Muskieman,2007-11-09 17:25:00,2472,"Lake Nipissing,, French River , Sturgeon River...  I have one on my wall that is 51 1/2 "" that weighed  48 lbs 2oz.. I had one come and grab a walleye on my line this fall that dwarfed the 51""incher I'm guessing that is was about 60lbs or so...Sturgeon River..  the new record might even come from a lake that nobody knows about...like Murray or Kukagami even Nepewassi... who knows?  My money lies with Nipissing the French or the Sturgeon River."
131969,PAZE,2007-11-09 21:52:00,132," 51.5 that weighed 48 lbs, you weight this fish?? I would love to see that thing, what did it have 27-28 inch girth?? man I want to see that thing.  Paul"
131973,kickingfrog,2007-11-09 22:00:00,8333,"I don't care what any of you say, Lindros deserves to be in the...wait???? Am I in the right forum??? I think I must have bumped my head"
131977,rickster,2007-11-09 22:05:00,495,I think DanC is right with nw ontario being a possibilty Rowan Lake for one has some enormous muskie but is a fly in lake
131983,Kerry,2007-11-09 22:21:00,383,"I'm going to echo Ron and say Lake Simcoe.The condition of the fishery with big perch,huge smallies a put and take smorgasborg of fatty lakers and whitefish,a herring moratorium,smelt coming back.Nobody allowed to fish for one.God if I was a musky I wouldn't need to look at a lure.She's already there.Probably die before anyone catches her. Kerry"
131997,Chris Purdy,2007-11-09 22:52:00,7,.... and here I thought Ron was only a big trouble maker on the MCI forum
132047,Roy,2007-11-10 01:28:00,13728,"What are you on about, Chris? Ron is a chef! He stirs the pot just the right way to bring people together and get things done. Hommages to y'all."
132048,irishfield,2007-11-10 01:30:00,26272,...he still can't buy a fish on Lake Temagami though! LOL
132057,Muskieman,2007-11-10 02:03:00,2472,
132060,irishfield,2007-11-10 02:10:00,26272,We excuse dyslexia when it comes to lying about fish !
132076,BillM,2007-11-10 03:01:00,17367,"I gotta say GBay, specifically Massassauga.  Endless amounts of habitat, lack of fishing pressure, access to big water and massive amount of feed.  Although, upper Niagara holds quite a few fish  My oldman tied into 2 muskie's fishing for smallmouth bass a few yeas back, landed one 38lbs, 45inch 5 mins later had another one on even bigger, broke the line.  This was on bass tackle, lol we were fishing for smallmouth 6lb test, little hooks, small minnows...  I know the lower Niagara has some big fish, atleast one or two big fish (40lb+) get caught during the St.Catharines Salmon Derby at the mouth of the river...  This is all based on personal opinion"
132082,Muskieman,2007-11-10 03:24:00,2472,"  NO but possibly the Ontario Record Laker will... maybe even break a world record for Walleye in Baie Jeanne..  Temagami has big pike, caught a 28lb  there myself back in '03 ..@ Sandy Inlet.  I lived In Temagami for a few years and know the lake pretty well myself.  Potential Record Lake: but No Muskies....but if there were Temag' could probably grow a record."
132195,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-10 16:48:00,2585,"i will say nipissing but for a good reason.  I alot on here dont think lake nipisisng should be mentioned.  but with the season being extended past the oct 15th closing of years past.  you can now fish for muskie as they really put the feed bag on.  I was in callandar in august and a guy live released a 59pound muskie in front of a mnr guy.  The mnr guy told me that the fish woudl be a record if it was caught again in november.  I never got to see the fish, i missed it by 10 minutes but did see the pictures on the guys digital camera.  It was simpy the biggest fresh water fish i have ever seen!  It was caught on a suick about 100 yards from shore.  The mnr person sold me on the fact that there are huge muskie in nip.  and the record is very possible to be caught there.  wherever its caught it sure is going to be a montser of a fish.  CHeers!"
50288,silveradosheriff,2007-03-22 01:03:00,1025,Thanks Marc - so GB it is?
50289,OhioFisherman,2007-03-22 01:05:00,6623,"""Erie,NO"" LOL Marc, I agree! There are places in it that should have them though, they remain a rarity."
50296,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 01:14:00,1780,"LOL, I've been trying not to post GBay in these treads because it's probably the least pressured musky water out there, believe me there are no big fish out here, waste of time fishing the bay, all the big ones are in MN and Wisconsin I think people are getting Georgian and Green Bay mixed up, the big girls are over there with Brett Favre, Marc was just being nice."
50297,fishdawg,2007-03-22 01:16:00,912,"When I mentioned Lake Ontario as a possibility, the lack of muskie fishing pressure was one of the reasons I considered it. Another was the wide variety of forage.  I was also kinda thinking along the Bay of Quinte as a possible spot.  the only way it will come from lake O though will be another O'brien scenario - next to nobody targets them there"
50303,trapshooter,2007-03-22 01:24:00,1234," Well, I'll bite... what's the deal with the O'brian fish??"
50307,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-22 01:32:00,0,"I was going to say in Marc's boat but he doesn't believe one exist.  I'm sure one will be coming out of the great lakes fisheries in the not so distant future. Top 4 on my list would be GB, Ottawa, Larry and Nipissing.  Only problem I see is it most likely will be an OOS catch from some dude fishing for walleye with a tube."
50330,fishdawg,2007-03-22 02:12:00,912, I too agree that an out-of-season record sized Muskie will appear before one that is in season
50343,Jigger,2007-03-22 02:45:00,1237,"I have to agree with your first post, fishdawg. It wouldn't surprise me one bit if the record came from Quinte. Although I agree with Marc T on his thread, the anomaly factor needs to figure in there as well. All it takes is one fish to become the next WR and it could surface in the same manner the smallie record was caught. Somewhere no-one expected and therefore didn't fish them. The only difference is that I think the next WR musky will come from a big body of water, not a small inland lake like the smallie was."
50360,SHAD,2007-03-22 03:23:00,134, I 2nd that if it hasn't been already.  Other is Lake Erie if not Lake O.
50362,Zib,2007-03-22 03:26:00,369,Lake St. Clair or Georgian Bay.
50386,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-22 04:48:00,621,"Ohiofisherman,yup I agree all wonderfull great big fish resources The essentail elements needed for such an individual to attain such a size to surpass 60 pounds are lacking in most areas  In reality a 30 pound muskie is what should be the common goal which is attainable and has always been since the dawn of time the goal (minus the exageration that existed/still exists today  )  I guess overtime looking at this and going beyond the species and looking in its blood line allowed further undertsanding of the realm of reality  Truth be a 40 to 45 pound is the true trophy a 45 to 49 pounder is a unique capture which few will ever do without time 50 pounders,well your part of the chosen few  In end,where all equal whether we catch a world record or not  The World Record Will Never Be Caught By a Walleye Fisherman out of Season"
50390,bigfish1965,2007-03-22 05:00:00,3382,"I'm going to pick Lake O. There's a few reasons. First is a lack of pressure and these fish will be much different. They will be nomads like the upper Niagara fish, but have a far greater food supply. There are less salmon about which is why we are seeing a spread of big walleye to area like where CCMT fishes or where I fish them. The reduction in competiton helps the musky. The zebra mussels will also help the musky. It allows for deeper weed growth for more ambush cover and at teh same time allows for better site attacks. The availability of hi-fat food like alwives and young trout and salmon will fatten these brutes up. The upper Niagara strain is the fastest growing musky in the country. Now that thye have nigrated downstream and are basically all over the lower Niagara and the mouth of the Niagara, these nomads will soon be a force to rreckon with. You can already see the takeover happening in the Whirlpool-Queenston corridor. There are tons of juveniles that are very aggressive eaters."
50422,ccmtcanada,2007-03-22 12:18:00,7971, Wouldn't that be something if muskie did begin to roam our spot....sweet!!! Guess I should start bringing the bigger rod/reel there...LOL.
50426,lew,2007-03-22 12:43:00,12767,"I'm just speculating like everyone else, but my $$$$ goes to either the Larry or Georgian Bay.  After seeing some of the fish that Marc gets in his boat, plus some of the ones reported from the Bay, I think it shows the potential is there for a true brute.  Personally I'd hate to see someone purposely kill a giant just to get the record, but it would actually be nice to finally see an end to sooooooo many years of arguing, name calling and bickering."
50427,RobHall,2007-03-22 12:49:00,261,I posted a blog entry about this topic.  Here are my top 5.  I'm surprised not many mention the French River when discussing world record musky.  I'm heading up there at the end of June and there's a monster musky with my name on it.  1. St Lawrence River 2. Georgian Bay 3. Ottawa River 4. French River 5. Lake Nipissing 6. Lake St. Clair   FOTB 
131714,Ron,2007-11-09 01:17:00,1683,Lake Simcoe
131723,danc,2007-11-09 01:37:00,4677,"There's too many golden horseshoe fisherman here that are betting on the places that everyone fishes. First of all, I bet that the current record won't be beaten. And if it does, I'll say that it comes from Northwestern Ontario. My long shot bet is Dryberry Lake. Under fished, has the habitat for huge Muskie growth, and has the history to boot. I've been there half a dozen times (fishing for Lake Trout, not Muskie) and the photos on the wall of the lodge are legendary. I'd hate to guess some of the weights of the fish in the photos. I've also had the opportunity to talk to some folks that have guided there for decades. A few of them have since passed away since I've talked to them a decade or so ago. The stories are incredible.  So, that's my bet. A long shot for sure."
131727,fishindevil,2007-11-09 01:57:00,6254,"Well like marc thorpe says,every year there are more muskies over 40lbs taken from the OTTAWA RIVER !!!!!   than anywhere else,there has also been 4 or 5 taken that are over 60lbs..  ..oh man would that ever be nice !!...so i think either there or the st.lawrence or lake st.francis...and they are all connected,so thats where im going for a muskie trip next year for sure...the mighty ottawa river.  ..man i love it there"
131728,irishfield,2007-11-09 02:02:00,26272,I sawed it beside a boat...a month ago on the Larry!  Had to raise this one back to the forefront eh Ronnie! LOL
131741,danc,2007-11-09 02:24:00,4677,  I'd guess that's because there's more people targeting them each year. There's a price to be paid for that. But what do I know? I don't even fish Muskie.
131754,Grandman,2007-11-09 03:27:00,31,Lake St Clair ???????????   Give your heads a shake.  Good bets-  Georgian Bay Eagle Lake Nip Lake O Lake E (Niagara in December) Larry Ottawa Quinte Lake X (F7 firecat knows)
131755,Garry2Rs,2007-11-09 03:38:00,1425,I agree that the next record will come out of the Great Lakes. It's simple math...Big waters equal low fishing pressure and a huge food supply...this equals big fish potential. Garry2rs
131768,Ron,2007-11-09 05:14:00,1683,I have to agree with 2r's on this one...  Big Lake Simcoe!
131772,Rich,2007-11-09 06:50:00,3927,Upper Niagara River
131783,mattyk,2007-11-09 11:50:00,2110,My vote is for Georgian bay or the St. Lawrence but who knows what VHS will do to the musky population there.
50101,zman,2007-03-21 19:20:00,179,I always woundered what other anglers thoughts were regarding what body of water the next world record muskie will come out of
50102,just2manylures,2007-03-21 19:22:00,144,Wasn't there a giant lunge that came out of Nippissing this fall?
50105,zman,2007-03-21 19:25:00,179,I seen a picture of that fish man it was big live release record I heard
50116,OhioFisherman,2007-03-21 19:47:00,6623,Who would want to? can you imagine the grief?
50119,PatrickGG,2007-03-21 19:53:00,562,"Lake Ontario, or the Niagara river."
50120,SlowPoke,2007-03-21 19:54:00,2984,West Arm. June 20 2007. My Boat.
50121,Bernie,2007-03-21 19:59:00,3190,Seen some huge ones jump on a reef not far from where I fish pickeral. Seen quite a few large ones boated too. Nipissing in my mind has the record Musky waiting to be caught.
50136,fishdawg,2007-03-21 20:22:00,912,Georgian Bay or some part of Lake Ontario now its just a matter of someone finding it among the vast blue & then landing it
50138,Clampet,2007-03-21 20:27:00,1947,St Lawrence river or Georgian Bay.
50143,1leggedangler,2007-03-21 20:35:00,364,I'll second the St.Larry river.
50144,Weeds,2007-03-21 20:38:00,782,"Sorry, just want to chuck in a question (on topic). I know Pike are found all over the place(Europe) but are musky restricted to North America?  If so, maybe add a few small fry  to foreign travelling  vessels ballast water and you may find yourelf a record come 20 years! If not, the Kawarthas !!!"
50149,Pigeontroller,2007-03-21 20:45:00,2793,Most likely the St Lawrence River. There are several Muskie guys that are exclusively targeting the next world record and they are fishing the 1000 Islands area.
50150,Weeds,2007-03-21 20:50:00,782,"Almost two different questions when you think about it, where is it but where will the biggest be caught?"
50151,setomonkey,2007-03-21 20:51:00,872,"I've read different threads on OFC about this, and the musky guys seem to be consistent in identifying Georgian Bay, Nipissing, Lake O, or the St. Lawrence.  Can't imagine it would be in the Kawarthas, Weeds, the general opinion is that you can get numbers but not size there.  But what do I know, I've only hooked two muskies (so far)...  Mike"
50177,FinS,2007-03-21 21:48:00,463,Detroit River or Lake St Clair
50181,Weeds,2007-03-21 22:00:00,782,Size EAT numbers. Food for thought.
50187,Roy,2007-03-21 22:31:00,13728,"Well, I'm certainly no expert but I KNOW one thing. The next genuine world record muskie will be caught in Canada. There are only a handful of spots on the map that can harbour that kind of a beast. Here's my short list in no particular order. St-Lawrence River (this is one of the bodies of water where Americans have a chance at it.) Ottawa River Georgian Bay Lake St Clair Niagara....not sure... Lake of the Woods ( another shot for an American record) There are a couple of others...maybe. Nipissing is a possibility...Lake Ontario, I don't think so."
50192,trapshooter,2007-03-21 22:47:00,1234,I saw a top '10 record muskie lake' article in a magazine a couple of years ago and Lac Seul was on it.  Have to be a C&R record because LS has a Zero posssion limit.
50201,silveradosheriff,2007-03-21 23:00:00,1025,GB
50204,Pigeontroller,2007-03-21 23:03:00,2793,"Well Roy, the Niagara and St Lawrence are both apart of Lake Ontario.  You can bet there's a 65 lb. + Muskie swimming in Lake O right now... Probably one in Erie as well."
50208,GbayGiant,2007-03-21 23:13:00,1780,"Somewhere in Canada.   I think the places Roy mentioned have shown the biggest average fish, and have a great chance also the French river.  But I think there are a couple freaks of nature swimming out there,  it's like predicting where the next 8 foot man will come from, you just never know, (look at all these 7'10"" Chinese men showing up lately playing basketball, you can't explain it, they are as rare as it get's)  I guess it will be an accidental catch somewhere in Ontario, or it will be a floating fish that died of old age."
50209,Roy,2007-03-21 23:14:00,13728,"Thanx Dax. I wasn't too sure where Lake O was. And yes, technically you're right. Practically speaking, people don't fish Lake O for muskie in great numbers. That's why I'm guessing that the next WR won't come from there."
50213,ehg,2007-03-21 23:20:00,2666,"Georgian Bay for the heaviest fish. This fish caught a couple years ago was only 53.5 inches long but weighed 63+lbs.  Imagine a 58 inch GB fish that fed like that thing.   St. Lawrence/ Ottawa R. around Montreal for longest fish. In the last 10 yrs. no place has produced more C&Red 58 inch to 60+ inch fish than this area. For some reason they don't get as bulky as the Georgian Bay fish.   Even though the world record is supposedly a 67 lb. Cal Johnson fish, the only musky caught without any contraversy is the 65 lb Ken O'Brein fish from GB, that's the world record thus far IMHO.  In the past i've read that Lac Seul have the most accelerated growth rates of musky, in the summer. To bad they have the long winters up there.  Lake Ontario probably has a WR fish swimming in it now, but that's like finding a needle in 100 haystacks.  cheers,  ehg"
50217,Guest gbfisher,2007-03-21 23:28:00,0, That remains to be seen! Hopefully the truth will get out soon!
50279,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-22 00:54:00,621,"I agree with GBfisher,dont hold your breath on Obrien  Williamson fish was 61 pounds,53 inches to the fork  To correct the miss information on the Ottawa and St lawrence not getting heavy or bulky is false,not everything is known about all Keep in mind most fish caught in the Gbay are speculations of weight,many posted are exagerated. Although bar non Gbay has produced the only legitemate 60 pounder but by 1 pound Till they hang like a door knob,its speculation No one can speculate the weight of a fish accurately,you can guesstimate fish But I find it funny,when I started muskie fishing 50 inches was a goal,even catching one Today some think 55 inches makes you something The spatter of speculated 50 pounders is like a ParKay add Butter,Parkay,Butter Parkay If it aint butter then its parkay  Till you weigh em you dont know,what you might think to be 50 pounder fer sure might be 45 to 49 pounds,not 50 pounds  To understand the the myth of Freaks,you must understand cold blooded animals Its not a common occurence for freaks of nature to occur in cold blooded animals Most giganitsm occurs in warm blooded animals Why you ask,simple body temperature stability  Cold blooded animals are regulated by heat,the sun and the warmth of their enviroments Warm blooded animals maintain their body temps which allows for continued and prolongued growth Most Gigantism is a form of disease generaly triggered by a tumor in the brain Many good bodies of water mentioned,I doubt if all hold any true world records Lac Seul,No Erie,NO Lake Ontario : No habitat St Lawrence/Ottawa :Needs Stable water conditrion and forage populations (which are declining) GBay: Very Possible Nippising: Great Big fish But it faces the same issues as the St Lawrence and Ottawa Niagara : No LOTW : NO Eagle Lake : Maybe,doubtfull  The biggest reason we may never see a world record......... Fishing Pressure,It greatly affects their feeding behavior and growth  To understand muskie growth,one must understand growth periods,where we live its short, which over prolongued periods a special individual could attain such weights , depending on the contributing elements and factors and if the yearly cylcle and life cycle would occur for this fish at its prime with all important enviromental factors colliding,so the odds are not good given the average life expectancy for most muskelunge is between 21-26 years of age  So good luck"
