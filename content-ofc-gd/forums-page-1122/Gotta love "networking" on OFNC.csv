Next thing you know I have a PM from Slowpoke and he has already taken the time to call Anglers Outfitters in Woodstock and has haggled a GREAT price (below Cabelas) on a pair of them on my behalf. Brian is also buying them out of his own pocket and I'm reimbursing him at BOQ when he delivers them into my hands. Just can't beat that kinda service!! THANKS BRIAN!  Then he points me in the direction of some 8' 6"" Shimano TDR trolling rods at the wonderful price of $37Cdn for THREE. I bought 6, as had he just a short time before me, and the seller is in Barrie..so I'm trying to pick the dozen rods up on Thursday as well for both of us. Saves us delivery charges all around and we'll have them in hand for BOQ to slap some reels onto for our boat guests.  Oh ya...the mandatory fish picture for the thread  "
132302,Dondorfish,2007-11-11 03:15:00,1000,There's that Karma coming back to ya Wayne - LOL  And good on you Slowpoke!   Don
132318,SlowPoke,2007-11-11 04:04:00,2984,"I'm just setting him up to ask for a big favour... he won't be able to say no... especially in public! Wayne, I gave Maureen a fishfinder. Would you mind bringing it home and she'll pick it up from your place? -Brian  Release shot... "
132319,irishfield,2007-11-11 04:06:00,26272,Sure Brian..I have a long rope..I will tow you up and down the BOQ! LOL  Sure..I'll hand that off to Maureen...but I won't install it!
132360,motv8tr,2007-11-11 08:59:00,2587,"Good deals for both of you   Brian, I should have told you I asked Wayne to bring back the fishfinder   And Wayne, thanks for bringing it back for me, I'll make arrangements to pick it up.  As for installing it, I'm sure I can figure it out....  Maureen"
132366,SlowPoke,2007-11-11 09:45:00,2984,"Well crap, I just wasted a favour! While I'm thinking about it, I managed to find the original box and manuals for the fishfinder. It should be a breeze to install. It was a good one in its day, the price on the box was $489 or something. Don't get your hopes up though, it's nothing to sneaze at by todays standards! It'll do until you have an opportunity to upgrade. -Brian"
132373,OhioFisherman,2007-11-11 11:46:00,6623,Life is so much easier when people work together!
132387,Spiel,2007-11-11 12:18:00,9065,"""Gotta love ""networking"" on OFC""  ....Yep you gotta love it!"
132397,Beans,2007-11-11 12:28:00,3339,Geeeeze !...From boots (brick 'n block) to fishing rods to fishfinders...  What a great site this is ...
132398,Rich Clemens,2007-11-11 12:30:00,3131,Ah ... one big happy family with one looking out for another.  Gotta love it - that's why I like it here.
132400,Big Cliff,2007-11-11 12:37:00,6899,"Ok Moe, you'll just have to bring that boat over here so I can install that fish finder for you and service that motor."
132486,motv8tr,2007-11-11 17:40:00,2587,  Thanks Cliff    I'll be in touch come spring....I won't be doing anything to the boat over the winter...need that time to get some stuff together  Maureen
132629,trapshooter,2007-11-12 01:41:00,1234,Very nice indeed.  Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock is a great guy and his shop is one of the better ones I've seen in Southern Ontario.
