132457,icefisherman,2007-11-11 15:38:00,952,"Question to all of you who are in the ""know"" or who own Lund 1700 Pro Sport and are using kicker motor: What is the right shaft length of the kicker? Is it Long shaft (20""), or is it short shaft?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132491,Fisherman,2007-11-11 17:54:00,7201,"I don't have that boat but the easiest way is to measure at the back from the top of the transon to the edge of the hull at the center.  Most Short shaft transoms will be 14-15"" high=short shaft, Long transoms are 19-20"" high.   If you can't hang the kicker on the edge of the transom and have to resort to an adjustable plate to hang the kicker on."
132495,irishfield,2007-11-11 18:07:00,26272,"And some Lunds really screw you up and need 25 !  Scratch that..was thinking main motor. Just measured mine..main 25"" and where kicker goes 20"" for it."
132500,icefisherman,2007-11-11 18:29:00,952,"  Fisherman,  You probably meant to measure from the top of the transom (where the kicker is going to be mounted) to the edge of the hull (again under where the kicker is going to be mounted), which is not in the centre? It would have been much easier if the hull was not going down on an angle therefore making big difference exactly where to mount the kicker. Going too much to the outside will not be good I imagine. Going too much to the inside may not allow the kicker propeller enough clearance under the hull and will not be good either. And not having the boat in front of you that makes it difficult. I may need to purchase the kicked before seeing the boat, hence the question. I think long shaft will probably work, but want to make sure when I lift the kicker, propeller is completely out of the water and not in motion while blasting full speed to the fishing spot.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132508,irishfield,2007-11-11 20:11:00,26272,"Emil...just looked in the 2007 catalogue and the 1700 Pro Sport has a 20"" transom that stays flat full width. So based on the 5"" difference on my Lund between main motor and kicker spot....this would lead me to believe that a short shaft 15"" would work on the prosport."
132511,icefisherman,2007-11-11 20:33:00,952," Wayne,  Now I can see why you were having so many questions when you were buying your Lund last year…I am similar to you….like to have it all figured out ahead of time to avoid unpleasant surprises. The transom on the Pro Sport has three different levels...  - level 1 -lowest level where the main motor gets mounted - level 2 - a bit higher level (hard to say how much higher only by looking at the picture but it is higher) where the kicker will be mounted. Maybe it is 5"" higher (?!) - level 3 - top level - even with the gunnels  I can send you picture if you want. You are right the transom is 20"" on the specks. So, I assume the main motor is 20"" shaft. Considering level 2 is about 5"" higher and the hull also goes higher the further outside you go, I was assuming the length of the kicker should be about the same as the length of the main motor (if the raise of the transom is equal to the rise of the hull in the area where the kicker is mounted....Kicker is mounted on higher part of the transom, but at the same time the hull is higher in that area too…if the elevation of the hull and transom are the same, the length of the two motors should stay the same?  I know it is hard to know for sure...this is why I was hoping someone who owns Pro Sport and has kicker can tell me the real measurement.  Cheers Ice Fisherman"
132513,SlowPoke,2007-11-11 20:36:00,2984,"Wayne, his 2000 has the cutout for the main motor. I don't know what year that changed but I think that may be the difference getting away with a short shaft on a newer model and needing a long shaft on the older one. Those cutouts tend to be about 3-4"" usually. -Brian"
132514,icefisherman,2007-11-11 20:40:00,952,"Wayne,  I've just sent you three pictures by PM. Brian has seen them.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132518,irishfield,2007-11-11 20:47:00,26272,Well looks like you'll need a long shaft then. Hate when I have to say that..
132520,icefisherman,2007-11-11 20:50:00,952,"Now here is the more critical question as follow up....say I get long shaft...will tilting it all the way up allow me to get the prop COMPLETELY out of the water so it doesn't spin when going full speed with the main motor?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132525,irishfield,2007-11-11 20:56:00,26272,It will probably be out of the water even sitting still Emil !  This shot shows how high mine sits..and adds a fish pic to the thread! LOL  
132529,icefisherman,2007-11-11 21:01:00,952,"And a bumpy ride it must have been that day Wayne? How do you have your kicker mounted though? Can't see it on the picture? Is it directly on the transom or are you using some sort of kicker scissors mount?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132533,irishfield,2007-11-11 21:10:00,26272,Bolted to the transom..just like you would throwin it on a tinny.  
132537,icefisherman,2007-11-11 21:20:00,952,"Picture is worth 1001 words! Thanks Wayne.  Do you have both motors steering at the helm? And what about throttle controls for the kicker?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132543,irishfield,2007-11-11 21:35:00,26272,Yes both steer from the helm and throttle control is there as well for the kicker. Works well..some days I wish I could quickly disconnect and hand steer..but less times than I'd rather sit and steer!
132551,icefisherman,2007-11-11 21:54:00,952,"  Hmmm, how can I make sure the kicker I get has both (remote teering and remote throttle)?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
132561,irishfield,2007-11-11 22:40:00,26272,Order it that way ! LOL You'd love the 9.9 Pro Kicker..electric tilt/start etc...but I think it's about $4600 + tax. Maybe be less now with the US dollar way down.
132712,SlowPoke,2007-11-12 09:54:00,2984," No response? I think Emil passed out! Just to clarify Emil, any kicker can be steered from the helm. It does not have it's own steering cable or wheel, it is connected to your main motor in one way or another. Some use clamps and a crossbar at the lower rear while others will connect in front near the main motor steering connection and a crossbar to the kicker. Remote throttle/start requires an additional set of cables and controls to the helm. Since Wayne's Pro-Kicker is worth more than my boat (   I would settle for an electric start tiller, quick release steering and a trollmaster remote. http://www.troll-masterpro.com/ -Brian"
132758,danbo,2007-11-12 13:53:00,2646,"In my experience those ""kickers"" are a waste of money! They're sluggish with all the weight they have to push. Install a drop-down ""trolling plate"" for your main engine instead.  http://gulffishing.com/np06troller.html"
132840,icefisherman,2007-11-12 17:45:00,952,"Yeah well Brian, for that price I may have passed out from falling off my chair if for nothing else ;-) Appreciate everyone's comments as they gave me good idea as to what could work for me. I do hope to find decent 8-9.9HP kicker for about $1,000 but time will tell. And allow few hundred dollars more to make it remote.  Danbo, my idea of kicker is not only for trolling but also to use it as spare motor in emergecny situations.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
