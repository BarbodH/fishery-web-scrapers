Thanks Guys your show ROCKS!   Okay here is my report,  Went out on simcoe today and the wind was blowing hard right from the start, I was on the water by about 7:30 am and there was a good 3-4 ft chop on the water! My small boat was takin in some water but I battled the waves and dragged tubes in 25-30 FOW and with no luck for about an hour! Then finally the wind started to die down by 9 and I had my first hit, felt like I hooked into weeds didn't even hit hard but I set the hook and fish on! The smallies fight incredibly strong for the cold water! My dad nets the smallie and it turns out to be a 4 lb 6 oz smallie! Nice One! Got the skunk out the boat!  Then we continue to fish and about 10 min after I feel a really strong WACK! I set the hook and the fish doesn't move, so I know its a HOG! After a good fight he finally surfaces what a PIG! My dad nets him and it is my best smallie this year! Weighs in at 5lb 4 oz! What a fat fish a true football!    After the two nice smallies my dad hooks and lands a couple of chunky 3 lbers and and then after around 10:30 the bite completely shut down! It was really cold today with a NE wind blowing in we were fishing in -2 C with the wind chill! Freezing but the smallies were hot! Great day on the water and hope to head out a couple times more before the season closes!  "
