132496,ecxstriper,2007-11-11 18:08:00,343,With fall bass fishing coming to a close I'm strating to think about turning my own wooden plugs for next spring. There are 15$ to 30$ each and I need something to do fishing related. Â I need to find a good sealer to soak my truned plugs in before I paint them any suggestions?

132714,Fishn Technishn,2007-11-12 11:29:00,198,"Been making my own plugs for a few years now. Have tried virtually ""everything"". What works best for me is Envirotex Lite. Get it at Michael's Craft  Store when they have a 40% off coupon. Seal lure with it, sand lighty(fine sand paper or Scotchbrite), paint , seal again. I use 1 coat for some baits but if it's for MR Esox I use a couple of coats--I do not pour as the directions tell you , I brush it on with a cheap disposable brush. If you get bubbles, simply blow/exhale on it, as the CO2 in your breath will bring the bubbles to the surface & burst them. Be certain to mix very well and let dry -be patient!! Need anything else PM me & I will try to help.  Be warned! This part of the hobby is VERY ADDICTIVE. Especially after you get a really good fish on your own lure.  FT"
