780489,NAW,2013-04-18 03:01:00,4022,"You guys catching this?  http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/17/us/texas-explosion/index.html   Watching the new right now, and they are saying that it levelled a large area of homes, including a nursing home."
780491,BillM,2013-04-18 03:15:00,17367,"Fertilizer plant, pretty much a giant bomb waiting to go off..   I wouldn't work there.  Exploded while they were trying to put out a fire, pretty much leveled everything.."
780494,NAW,2013-04-18 03:33:00,4022,"They are reporting no deaths so far.  Seems weird considering the damage.  They reported that you could ""feel"" the explosion in Dallas 100km away.  How could that not kill anyone?"
780495,BillM,2013-04-18 03:37:00,17367,Check this link out of the blast..  I'd be surprised if anyone wasn't killed because of that.  http://www.kwkt.com/news/caught-camera-fertilizer-plant-explosion-near-waco
780496,BillM,2013-04-18 03:48:00,17367,60-70 people reported dead.  http://www.khou.com/news/Powerful-explosion-rocks-small-town-north-of-Waco-203510281.html
780499,dhickey,2013-04-18 05:12:00,1038,Kinda makes you wonder why plants like this are alowed to set up shop within town/city limmits knowing full well the risk of innocent people loosing their lives. Or why poeple would live so close?
780503,mike rousseau,2013-04-18 06:24:00,4661,There's a million things out there that can kill ya.... Kinda hard to protect everyone from everything...  There's a fertilizer plant in my city... Right smack in the middle of a residential area... There's houses like 100 feet away...
780505,Gerritt,2013-04-18 06:42:00,6129,Yup same here mike... Agrium is located in Brighton
780508,fishindevil,2013-04-18 07:47:00,6254,Wow !!!! That's brutal ....
780524,bigugli,2013-04-18 12:19:00,6138,"There are all sorts of potentially lethal industrial plants nestled in hundreds of major towns across Canada.  Think propane depot, or fuel facility, gas plants, union carbide, fertilizers, chemical plants all within your urban boundaries. All capable of producing a massive explosion or gas cloud. How about lethal chemical loads on trains running through the city like the Mississauga rail disaster. Nothing new here."
780529,jedimaster,2013-04-18 12:53:00,3472,"What about that propane plant that went up in toronto a few years back. The instant reaction is protect everyone from everything... kinda like a gun registry or a law that bans this gun or that gun because someone used it to kill someone... in the end hopefully logic sets in that you need to put in appropraite safety precautions. Its certainly sad and terrible. I guess time will tell if there was any wrong doing, carelessness or whatever. Hopefully it was just an accident and nothing was malicious."
780548,mr blizzard,2013-04-18 14:48:00,1589,"Just watching the news, they say it might have been, and I stress only might have been  a reaction to water from the fire hoses warming the material and turning them into vapours as opposed to using foam.  Terrible tragedy, prayers go out to all involved.  Makes you realize the importance of making the most of every day and appreciating your loved ones.  Every day is a gift."
780554,Joey,2013-04-18 15:03:00,9122,That video is brutal.  Poor kid!  Another terrible tragedy this week
780699,moxie,2013-04-19 02:29:00,1566,"Sad news for sure. Dangers lurk everywhere. Many gas mains that were once in what were considered rural areas have been over run by the urban sprawl. Worked on a sewer installation in the area of Yonge st-Gamble road in Richmond hill a few years back and had to cross two mains, the smaller one being 24"". Its' neatly tucked no deeper than 15-20' under a walkway-bicycle path intersecting neighbourhoods as it snakes East-West."
780754,jjcanoe,2013-04-19 13:45:00,744,they measured that explosion at 2.1 on the richter scale!!!! (according to CP24)
