779376,limeyangler,2013-04-13 00:37:00,5204,Hi all.  I am just about to make the switch from PC to Mac.  Was just about to hand over cash when i found this resource. Just saved myself over $100 for some books including  OS X Mountain Lion: The Missing Manual and Imac for Dummies.  Hard copies are available to purchase but the 'ebook' PDF downloads are free.  Hope this does not break forum rules....but here is the link.   http://it-ebooks.info/

779391,limeyangler,2013-04-13 01:35:00,5204,"Hey John,  Its basically a site where you can download free copies of various books about different computer topics. Use the search feature on the site as you would use google, ie type in whole titles or keywords (make sure google box it ticked), and you should find a publication that answers  your question."
779421,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-13 11:13:00,2582,Good luck switching over to a Mac Simon. Love mine.
779462,Gerritt,2013-04-13 14:54:00,6129,Yup I will never go back to WinBlows... EVER.. Welcome to the dark side  G
779521,limeyangler,2013-04-13 20:59:00,5204,"    Yeah....hoping to like mine too. Going for a bit of a beastie machine...3.4Ghz i7....32GB Ram....1TB Fusion Drive...27"" screen. My videos and pics were due a makeover!"
779725,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-15 00:04:00,2582,The only thing I understood about what you are saying here Simon is the 27 inch screen   A computer geek I am not.
779730,limeyangler,2013-04-15 00:18:00,5204, LOL....me either Steve. But i'm becoming a bit more interested in the whole computer thing by the day....have even been looking at going back to school to get up to speed on all this stuff....the more i look into it the more i realise i know NUFFINK!
779734,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-15 00:36:00,2582,"Going back to school...good for you Simon. My old neighbor always said "" The great thing about knowledge is that it's not very heavy to carry around"" I always liked that saying."
779816,FloatnFly,2013-04-15 12:43:00,1640,"non integrated video and sound card included?>  if not, then your video/pictures and music won't see much of an upgrade even with the massive amount of RAM and speedy processor"
779852,limeyangler,2013-04-15 14:43:00,5204," YES....it comes with 'non-intergrated' GPU.  The model I have chosen comes standard NVIDIAGeforce GTX 675MX with 1GB of dedicated memory (GDDR5) , however, i chose to upgrade that and mine will be shipped with a GTX 680MX with 2GB GDDR5 memory."
780262,hotsky,2013-04-17 02:51:00,400,"I've used macs since 2002 and I got my first oneMacBook Pro laptop over a year ago and love it. Portability of a laptop is awesome, I dont think I could go back to desktop."
780323,limeyangler,2013-04-17 13:49:00,5204," I hear ya, some argue that the desktop's days are numbered. At the moment though I use my blackberry on the go(In McD's typing this at the moment). The Macbook Pro is an awesome machine....particularly with the 'Retina' display....maybe in the future...but a high spec desktop still suits our individual and family needs.  Just placed the order yesterday....including AppleTV.  Now that gizmo looks cool....with the latest version of OS X I can wireless stream all of my desktop content to my HDTV.....in up to 1080 resolution. So basically I should be cancelling my satellite subscription....lol."
780325,BillM,2013-04-17 13:55:00,17367,"1080p content over wireless is a stretch.. If possible, you'll want to hardwire those connections."
780370,Raf,2013-04-17 18:35:00,3495,"yup, just cause it can, doesnt mean it will.  i stream from a NAS to PS3 to TV but it's all wired."
780385,limeyangler,2013-04-17 19:30:00,5204, LOL....on my system it probably wont be able to.  But it'll be watchable. (hopefully)
