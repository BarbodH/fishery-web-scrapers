780223,moxie,2013-04-17 00:09:00,1566,"Hoping last weeks four days of rain would wash away any last traces of ice off the lake and Environment Canada's forecast for last Sunday predicted to be mainly sunny with a temperature of 7 C and winds between 10-15 k, the conditions would be just about right to warm up a  bay or two and activate the feed bag on some soft water Crappie. Add to the forecast the fact we made road trips both Thurs and Fri to check ramp conditions and any signs of lingering ice packs or bergs, anticipation and expectations went into overdrive.   Saturday:  Honey-Do items.   Sunday:  Hit the ground running at 6:30 Sunday morning, round up the boys and head north with blue bird skies following us all the way to the ramp. Launch and head over to the first bay as clouds begin to roll in, wind picks up and temperature falls. We see a school of smaller fish and our first hour or so doesn't even produce a single hit. Now under full cloud cover, wind still blowing and even the odd flake of snow falling we make a decision to try another spot and roll into bay #2. It didn't look like the day we anticipated or expected would come to fruition until one of Mother Natures' own tipped us off.  As we start picking the shoreline apart looking for our quarry I notice an Osprey hovering over head near the end of the bay. The bird is locked onto something and within seconds begins its dive only to abort part way down. We watch as it circles and starts to hover once more. As it dives a second time its posture suggests full committal and as it hit the water we waited to see what, if anything, would be pinned to its' talons on the way out. As it left the water the fish in its' grip was indeed a Crappie but as it flew away the fish shook loose . We were hoping we would fair better as we bee lined it to the spot, and connected with fish. The cold, wind and flakes of snow seem to matter much less as for the next few hours were spent engrossed in the ""thrill a minute"" our sport can sometimes provide. Just takes some Moxie at times.     GoPro footage of the day's events. Produced by Purpleghost. Click the link below:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu-LzFCpluY&feature=youtu.be  "
