780412,misfish,2013-04-17 21:00:00,29133, Atleast now I know how too bud. Pretty simple.
780413,davey buoy,2013-04-17 21:01:00,5505,"Glad you fixed it up bud,now let's change that mud to gold !! lol."
780444,Ralph Field,2013-04-17 23:45:00,1018,Nice you were able to get the help you needed. Nice of Jet to show you all the parts in his reel.
780362,misfish,2013-04-17 17:56:00,29133,"Other then the obvious.  While I was out today,I notice play in the reel. I have not dropped it or banged it around. Im very careful with it,other then laying it down beside a fish for a pic.  Check the 2 vids. I have not taken it apart as of yet,as if it,s non normal wear,I hope to get it fixed by Okuma. Theres easy, a millimeter movement in the housing,like maybe the spacer thats in it ,is worn.       Looking at theÂ Schematics   https://www.okumafishing.com/product/view/reels/float-reels/raw-ii-float-reel ."
780373,Hairpy,2013-04-17 18:54:00,73,If you can drop it by angling specialties i'm sure Tom can fix it quick  Joseph
780374,BillM,2013-04-17 18:54:00,17367, If it's under warranty it needs to go back to Okuma.
780377,misfish,2013-04-17 19:05:00,29133,"Should I take it apart,and see if that washer spacer is worn? Is there a Okuma repair rep in Ontario?"
780378,davey buoy,2013-04-17 19:10:00,5505,"I'd take it apart carefully,no one will no the difference. Could be something simple. But that's just me.lol."
780379,misfish,2013-04-17 19:14:00,29133,"Im not ready yet to get that far into,til I get some good advise on the prob. I dont want to make things worse,if it,s covered."
780382,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-17 19:22:00,10439,Centerpin retaining screw is loose/missing. Not sure how the Okumas are but most (all of my pins) have a screw in the center that keeps the spool attached to the pin. The Aventa's have a knurled nut on that holds the spool on. There is a rubber O ring that keeps tension so the nut doesn't back off and fall out. I don't see a center pin retaining screw or this Okuma knurled nut there on either of your videos.  If you look @ the image of the Raw II on the Okuma site you will see what I'm talking about.  https://www.okumafishing.com/product/view/reels/float-reels/raw-ii-float-reel
780383,misfish,2013-04-17 19:25:00,29133,"Dave,the vids are dark,but the reel is in full tack. The knurled screw is tight,and the rubber washer is there. As you can see,the bearings move back and forth in the bore."
780384,davey buoy,2013-04-17 19:25:00,5505,Any reputable dealer will understand that you were on a day/3 day vacation and you had to try something. Many times over the years I have done this and WILL argue to the fullest if it has to be brought in.Fishing related or not. Never a problem.
780386,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-17 19:31:00,10439,Not sure if the Okuma's have a shim that goes between the cap and the pin or not. Have you had the cap off recently? Before the problem occurred?
780388,misfish,2013-04-17 19:44:00,29133,"Looking at the drawing,my reel has all the parts.  Hope this helps.    "
780389,Jet,2013-04-17 19:53:00,364,"Misfish,  Have you ever taken the reel apart to clean/access the bearings?  I have a Sheffield and I am sure it is mechanically the same. There are spacer pieces inside that I have neglected to put back and that causes the exact issue you have.  If you haven't then certainly something is amiss."
780391,misfish,2013-04-17 19:58:00,29133,"Never had it apart. The only thing I have ever done,is take the spool off to wash it out. Everything is the same as I bought it. Thanks"
780392,Jet,2013-04-17 20:00:00,364," If it was fine before then suddenly you got play, perhaps one of the rubber rings inside has been rotated out of place.  I'll take mine apart and double check how it's setup and report back.  Perhaps you can take it apart fully to inspect. Mine came with a schematics pictures."
780393,kemper,2013-04-17 20:05:00,2232,"My (biased) advice would be to cut your losses and go to an islander or something similar.  Every single Okuma product I have ever owned has spontaneously combusted.  Float rod (blammo) Bait caster (boom three times) Ultra lite (snap) Spinning reel (crumble)  I'm not hard on my gear, and I take care of it properly.  I will never, ever, ever, consider buying a single thing form Okuma again."
780394,misfish,2013-04-17 20:07:00,29133,"I checked the schematics,theres a washer inside the bore with the bearings. I,ll atemped to take it apart.Dont really want to just incase it voids warranty."
780395,misfish,2013-04-17 20:09:00,29133," I have been very happy with this reel Kemp.  As for an islander,I have been watching for them used. They go like a banana split.Gone.LOL  I would buy new,but right now,it,s not in the cards. Just waiting .  Im going to wait til I hear back from Harrison on the warranty."
780396,Jet,2013-04-17 20:12:00,364,"  Here's what I'm talking about.  The metal spacer closest to spool goes in first, then on top of that is that small black rubber washer. Without that I get the exact same play.  Then last goes the bearing (the other bearing is inside the spool fyi)  I would have zero worries about taking it apart for warranty. Not only is it super easy, but with this reel is necessary to do once in awhile as it is not as protected from sand like my other reels are.  "
780402,misfish,2013-04-17 20:35:00,29133,"Ok heres whats in there.    I have have solved the problem.  When I took the first bearing out,the o ring,was not sitting right. It was in the bore. I put it all back together,and the play is gone.  Sometimes the simple things are so stupid.  Thanks all for your help.  Guess I can wait for that islander,abit longer.LOL  AGAIN,THANKS FOR THE HELP JET AND ALL.  Now lets hope these rains dont hurt the rivers to much more. MAN THEY ARE ALL BLOWN. I went to three of them today."
780405,Jet,2013-04-17 20:45:00,364,High-Five!!!!  Gotta love the feeling when you fix something that was broken yourself.
780406,misfish,2013-04-17 20:48:00,29133,  Thanks again.
780407,bare foot wader,2013-04-17 20:52:00,1354,"took too long typing, late post....  I've had good luck with my aventa, gets beat up a lot and keeps on trucking"
780409,Terry,2013-04-17 20:55:00,14456,and  it's always good when there are no left over parts when they are back together
780410,misfish,2013-04-17 20:59:00,29133," LOL I was thinking,did he read,,,,,,,,,LOL  Na worries."
780411,davey buoy,2013-04-17 21:00:00,5505,Me too!
