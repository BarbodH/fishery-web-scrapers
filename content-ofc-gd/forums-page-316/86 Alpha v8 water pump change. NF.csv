I would like as a preventative maintenance measure  to at least look at the water pump and change if if neccessary. Anyone done this?,if not I'll check elsewhere but I know you members have a wealth of knowledge. Under hose pressure it spits crazy out the back,but I'm not sure when you force feed your motor with water how accurate that is. Thanks for any help. Dave."
780309,bigbuck,2013-04-17 13:07:00,2449,"Water pump or impeller? Check on iboats.com. There is a wealth of knowledge on that site as well as some guys that are willing to help you through a job. If its the impeller, you should replace it every 2-3 years to avoid problems."
780345,BITEME,2013-04-17 16:11:00,1968,Every 2 years we do the impellers on the rescue boat regardless of the condition they are in. mind you we put more hours then you probably do but its good insurance   cheers peter
780366,davey buoy,2013-04-17 18:27:00,5505,"Impeller Is what I meant  ,Quite common job,so I'm told,just hoped someone here has done it.Changed a few in outboards,haven't really looked at that area yet since I installed the new outdrive.Thanks Guys."
780428,jedimaster,2013-04-17 22:43:00,3472,I did mine on a alpha a few times. Nothing too tricky. Just follow the shop manual if you one. Not really any different than any other outboard. http://www.mercstuff.com/waterpumpinst.htm
780429,bigbuck,2013-04-17 22:50:00,2449,They aren't too tough to do. You can download the Merc shop manuals for the motor and the drive off of the iboats forums.
780430,davey buoy,2013-04-17 22:50:00,5505,I use mercruser sterndrive forum as well. Sometimes a little slow to reply. Has served me well over the years. No shop manual. Thanks for the tip!
780432,davey buoy,2013-04-17 22:51:00,5505,"Will do,thanks!"
780437,jedimaster,2013-04-17 22:58:00,3472,Gonna PM you send you a link...
780438,jedimaster,2013-04-17 23:01:00,3472,The one thing I should mention is that you will need to bend the new impellor to get it inside the housing. Just make sure you bend it the right way or it won't work.
