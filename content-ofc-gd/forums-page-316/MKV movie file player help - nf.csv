780052,Entropy,2013-04-16 01:37:00,747,Where can I download - from a safe site- a 'safe' MKV file player.  I've got a few movies of this type but not a player for them.  Any experiance / recomendations?  Thanks Entropy
780059,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 01:47:00,10439,Try VLC Media Player. It plays most video files.  http://vlc-media-player.en.softonic.com/

780064,BillM,2013-04-16 01:49:00,17367,VLC for sure.
780076,limeyangler,2013-04-16 02:13:00,5204,X3 for VLC.

780127,SirWhite,2013-04-16 13:53:00,210,KMPlayer is probably the best to use. You can change aspect ratios and many other things but it is simpler than VLC. Also if on IPhone get AVPlayer and all movies can play on your Apple product.
780148,Uncle Buck,2013-04-16 16:16:00,1000,I use VLC on the computer...  The sony Blu-ray players read everything...  put it on a thumb drive and plug it in and you're good to go
