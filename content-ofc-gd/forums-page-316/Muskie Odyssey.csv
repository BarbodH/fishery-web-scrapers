779577,Ron,2013-04-14 01:15:00,1683,"Yes indeed it was a great show. Spent my fair share of coin, ironically, not on lures but on a new Revo. Now I got the itch to try it out. Gotta hand it to Mike and his wife Danna. They had a great booth and every chance I had to go over to chat, there was someone else buying more of his lures! I bet it was one of the busiest booths at the show. Very happy with the T's he set aside for me and just wait till you see what else the 2 buggars did for me!  My only regret was to not get there for Sarics first seminar, it was all about casting. Unfortunately we only got to take in the trolling seminar and anyone that knows me, as soon as Jim said the word ""trolling"" I started to fall asleep.  I'm sure it was a well appreciated talk, but i just couldn't keep my eyes open, sorry Jim. As much as I am not involved with MCI any more, a big hats off to the boys who made this work and fine tuned so well. Looking forward to the next one.  Cheers, Ron..."
779604,landry,2013-04-14 02:46:00,1005,I wanted to go but couldn't. My friend picked me up 3 custom handlebarz. Can't wait to fondle them.
779607,Live2fish85,2013-04-14 03:09:00,1633,Was a great show that's for sure. Stopped at Mike's booth first to say hi and chat with him for a bit as well slowpoke. Picked up some of the Handlebarz shirts and a few double 10's.  Looked around and grabbed a few other things.
779624,Rizzo,2013-04-14 11:39:00,4754,"You're killing me. I made the last 3 Odysseys, but had to work this time and couldn't go...dang new job. Hope everyone had a great time and spent lots of $$ on pretty new lures. i bought so many at the last Odyssey there are a few that haven't seen water yet...and a few others that have no teeth marks yet."
779698,cl_fishin,2013-04-14 20:36:00,138,"Show was great, and it was great to meet so many ""Internet"" friends face to face. A special thanks to all those that made purchases at the 50 Inch Apparel booth you guys kept me running all day. It was my first Odyssey and won't be my last awesome turnout, and a great job done by all the MCI volunteers    :clapping: "
780002,Handlebarz,2013-04-15 23:48:00,3790,It was great to see everyone. We had alot of OFC members stop over at the booth and chat lots that I have known or met before and a bunch I had not met but was glad to meet. To the new guys and girls from here that I just met please forgive me if I forget your name next time we meet I was so busy at times I did not realize who I was talking with until after.  Carl it was great to finally meet you for a chat Saturday.  John Cowan was awesome for lending his musky to us for the day. He picked it up Friday drove from advance taxidermy to st.catherines dropped it off then went back to T.O. That was to nice. I must say that because of the musky being in the booth all day my wife has decided that she wants me to get my replica done. Woohoo thanks John  I just want to thank all the OFC members for the support over these years your all awesome.
780558,BucktownAngler,2013-04-18 15:21:00,582,"the show was great. it was my first time going, will be going again for sure.  Figure 8 baits had some great buy 2 get 1 free deals on lures. also picked up some frantic bait, waterwolf and handlebarz lures. lots of stuff here you cant find in stores  got to chat with jim saric a bit, and got some tips from him which was nice. he was walking around mingling after his trolling seminar.  i was hoping to buy a new lakewood box, and trolling rod. but didnt find what i was looking for. only JB's was selling rods, and i asked if they had the st croix trolling rod, they tried to sell me the mojo musky. i told them i was looking for the glass st croix, they said were sold out before they came to the show. bummer. but that rod money went towards more lures lol. so not a total loss.  ended up getting a sweet deal on a casting rod in the silent auction. cant complain.  heres some of the goodies i got  "

779418,Handlebarz,2013-04-13 10:01:00,3790,  Ready and thanks to John Cowan for lending his beast from LOTW that he caught using a handlebarz D10 to win the musky hunter school of esox last summer.
779534,SlowPoke,2013-04-13 22:04:00,2984,"Wow, what a great show!!! It seems like twice as many vendors as the last two shows and the turnout seemed higher too. Ran into many OFNers; some I hadn't seen in a while and some I was able to meet for the first time. The Handlebarz booth looked great and always had people buying and browsing. John Cowan's fish looked terrific but that shouldn't be a surprise as it was an Advanced Taxidermy mount. The detail was incredible not only on the outside but as far as you could see down the mouth. I'm sure if you looked close enough you could see what it ate right before hitting that Handlebarz lure! Nice prize table. I know this not because I won but because I checked tickets for somebody else that won three times... Grrrr! If you can't be out fishing, this is a great way to spend an April day."
