The place I worked at(run in Canada, funded by Canadian dollars) is launching there new website design, with an American theme and graphics of the statue of liberty etc... Does anyone else get particularly offended by companies that try and make it look like they are American? Just annoys me."
780602,BillM,2013-04-18 19:10:00,17367,Give us the website addy.
780605,Fish4Eyes,2013-04-18 19:18:00,1022,Sounds like the higher ups think it may be a good thing for business. I bet most would do the same if it meant increasing the odds of lining their pockets thicker.
780608,jedimaster,2013-04-18 19:30:00,3472,"Of course that's there feeling is to try and make it look like they are American as there business is international. Its companies like this that help to keep Canada down as far as I am concerned. There are very successfully global companies proud of there roots. Just annoying is all. Haha, had a soap box moment I guess.  I am all done, feel free to move on. lol"
780611,Roy,2013-04-18 19:36:00,13728,It's normal business practice.
780612,Terry,2013-04-18 19:37:00,14456,"well i saw an American site that tried to look Canadian,,I think   it was a porn site   and it had some beaver on it's front page"

780627,jedimaster,2013-04-18 20:59:00,3472,"OH well, I guess on the good side everyone from management and above shows up at 11 and leaves by 3 every day."

780643,ketchenany,2013-04-18 22:25:00,3229,"So far my ""American"" parents have our company working. Our clients are all Canadian, we are just a piece of a worldwide pie!"

780660,Whopper,2013-04-18 23:42:00,2174,I do it every chance I get
780685,danc,2013-04-19 00:56:00,4677,Obviously not a unionized company.
780698,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-19 02:18:00,8243,"United Steelworkers of America. A brotherhood of Canadian workers, none working for Canadian wholly owned companies. Yes it's great to be Canadian, but don't be na√Øve to think if you stood an American next to a Canadian, or an American or Canadian company anyone could tell the difference. And not many would care, other than the Canadian."
