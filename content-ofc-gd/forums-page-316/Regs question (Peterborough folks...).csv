Looking to get out for some panfish and I'm in Peterborough for a while. There is a back bay off the Ottonabee that I like the looks of.  As far as I can tell it is open, because the sanctuary begins south of Lock 19 which is below Little Lake correct?  Thanks for any help."
779919,snoozer,2013-04-15 19:14:00,7,"Yup, Lock 19 is immediatly south of Lansdowne Street in Peterborough. The sanctuary continues down to the Bensfort Bridge. Everything north of Lock 19 is open for panfish and coarse fish, right up to the Youngs Point bridge at the north end of Katchewanooka."
