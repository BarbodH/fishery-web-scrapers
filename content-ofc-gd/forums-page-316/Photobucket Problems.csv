779691,lew,2013-04-14 18:58:00,12766,"When you opened your Photobucket account you should have received an email address. Once your pictures have been downloaded to your computer you can simply email them to your Photobucket page and from there, simply transfer them to whatever album you want.  I don't even bother uploading to Photobucket anymore as I find it faster to email them."
779696,misfish,2013-04-14 20:00:00,29133, You EMAIL it Lew?
779705,fishindevil,2013-04-14 21:43:00,6254,I just uploaded about a dozen pics on photobucket from my iPhone yesterday and it worked just fine !!!!! And did a pic this morning as well and no problems for me and I always do it from my phone as well
779710,lew,2013-04-14 22:07:00,12766," Yup, goes straight to Photobucket Brian, then I just move it to whatever album I want.  Much faster than uploading the normal way, at least on my computer."
