780233,Ainsley,2013-04-17 01:08:00,142,"I got my first dobyns rod last season and have been trying to swap out my existing rods to them since.  Started with a dx744c which I use for spinner baits, jigs and soft swimbaits. Up next was a dx743c, an amazing rod for senkos and other plastics. Near the end of the season I picked up a champion 702c and 765c for dropshot/finesse and flipping/pitching respectively. Haven't had a chance to use them yet. Next up is a champion 765cb glass to replace my similar Powell for deep cranks and a 704cb graphite for jerkbaits, topwaters, and shallow cranks.  What does everyone else use and what do they think of them?"
780256,musky_hunter,2013-04-17 02:16:00,328,"nice selection...i got few dobyns rods and think they are very good, the champion lineup are my favorites.  not the lightest or the most sensitive but very well balanced.  there cranking rods are the best in the business!"
780260,EC1,2013-04-17 02:36:00,930,"Have handled a 733 Champ, 684 Champ, 766Flip Champ, & 795DX. 733 was a beaut for pitching and skipping - until I broke it. Others claim it as a spinnerbait /senko rod 684 does my jerkbait and topwater duties 766 was extremely stiff, and I don't think I've come across situations where I needed that much power yet. 795 of course the flipping.  To be honest, I wouldn't touch a savvy (I think plenty of rods are better at $150), champions are pretty good, but once you've had a DX, that's all you'll want."
780263,Dan668,2013-04-17 03:02:00,1120,"The savvys aren't the greatest. The only one i own is the 735 for frogs. Other than that my rod collection are split between Dobyns and G loomis. Currently have a Savvy 735, Champ 734 735, Glass 704 705 765, Dx 744 745 795. Too many!"
