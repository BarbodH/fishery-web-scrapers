With the current Dash - the biggest one that will fit is my current model (7 HDS).  I want to go to a 10 - but the windshield will be an issue.  Anyone used a RAM mount to workaround this problem?  If so, can you send me some pictures, so I have an idea on mounting possibilities? Thanks. "
779834,BillM,2013-04-15 13:38:00,17367,"From what I've been seeing, most of the big graphs go on ram mounts..  Lots and lots of them out there as well.  Something like this would probably work.  http://www.universalmania.com/_e/RAM_Mounts/product/36565/RAM_Mount_Marine_Electronics_Mount_Gimbal_Bracket_Under_15lbs_RAM_D_111U_C.htm"
779841,Dan668,2013-04-15 13:58:00,1120,"I'm not a fan of ram mounts. In rough water mine would go down so i sold them. Unfortunately they work out best on some windshield models. If you do decide on it, make sure you get the 2.5"" ball.  I use a johnny ray 207 and a Cisco Mount for my HDS 10."
779844,Roy,2013-04-15 14:08:00,13728,"If you get the proper RAM mount for the application, it'll never move."
779845,Wolf 3,2013-04-15 14:12:00,134,"If you are going to install an HDS 10 on it and want it not to budge, I would have a look at the following mounts:  Cisco (mentioned above) http://www.ciscofishingsystemsltd.com/shop/sure-lok-electronics-mount-5225  RMC mounts http://radioworld.ca/electronics-mount-c-3_769.html?filter_id=233  Here is a video for some mounting possibilities,"
779847,Fang,2013-04-15 14:30:00,1330,I run a HB 1197 on a crestliner fishhawk 1750 so very similar layout to what your facing. I bought the RAM-D-111U-C which is for the big fish finders and mounted it on the gunnel right beside the windshield  That RAM does not move when tightened down but I have to say in really rough water where the boat is taking a bit of a beating in the waves that size of unit on top of the RAM does have some weight and it makes me a bit nervous trying to run full out  I run Lake O and Erie and get bounced around a bit so I just take the throttle back a bit
779892,PAZE,2013-04-15 17:27:00,132,"Take it from experience, buy the proper ram mount and it does not move. I should cost roughly $150 but well worth the money."
780010,Tony68,2013-04-16 00:03:00,31,Just picked up the same mount Fang mentioned at Radio World this weekend for 85 no tax. Looks like a solid mount. Can't tell you how it preforms yet.
780187,hutch4113,2013-04-16 19:44:00,374,"Ok.  The Cisco mounts look nice.  If anyone has some pictures of their setup, please PM me (or post in here).  I am also looking for some mounting ideas."
780202,Pigeontroller,2013-04-16 21:27:00,2793,"Doesn't show you much, but my LCX-27 wouldn't fit without being on a Ram mount.  "
780203,mike rousseau,2013-04-16 21:27:00,4661,"Not a fan either... I prefer a regular gimble bracket where possible...  My brother has a 10"" unit on 2 ram mounts... Doesn't hold worth a poop...  I've even used big heavy duty ones with computers on lift trucks... Not the greatest...  I'm guessing there are some situations where they're good... But I haven't seen it yet...  But sometime you have to compromise due to limitations..."
780450,PAZE,2013-04-18 00:02:00,132," The one Dax has there is the wrong size for the HDS 10, you get the proper one it will not move. its $150, the $85 is the wrong size to small"
780465,bucktail,2013-04-18 00:55:00,1857,I have a HDS 8 on a RAM mount and I find it move s a little but then I can always tighten it a bit nmore and its stays put.
780473,Dan668,2013-04-18 01:35:00,1120,"I had my 7 on the 1.5"", didnt hold worth a damn. Ball was destroyed the first year, had to buy a new one. My 10 used to be on the 2.5"", in rough water, it slowly moves down. I didnt trust it, so i replaced it with more of a fixed mount. Didnt want it moving to hit the windshield or dash. Maybe i was just unlucky with mine."
780504,mike rousseau,2013-04-18 06:32:00,4661,Also a ram isn't needed on most boats... If a gimbal bracket fits... I'd be using that...  Best use I've seen for a ram mount was a support for the head of the bow mount electric motor... It stopped it from bouncing and flexing all day in rough water....
