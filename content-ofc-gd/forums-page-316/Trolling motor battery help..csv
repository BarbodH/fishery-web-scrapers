779699,Beats,2013-04-14 21:00:00,543,"I have just acquired a 10' jon boat that will primarily be fishing a small pond in the area.   I am going to be purchasing a trolling motor soon for it and I have been told that a 30 lb thrust motor would be best for it.  Reason being that anything much higher that 30lb and you are going too fast to troll effectively in a small boat. Or so Im told.  I am looking for help in the battery department. I have zero experience with both trolling motors and the required batteries.  I will probably be getting a Minnkota 30lb model.  Can anyone recommend a battery make/model that would be appropriate?  I have done a search on here and have about 20 windows/topics open that I am going through but I am wondering if anyone knows of any current deals or upcoming deals?  Deep Cycle seems to be what is best, but any opinions for a boat my size?  I'd like something that I won't be replacing in 2 years and yet not going overkill.  Thanks."
779700,Blue Lk,2013-04-14 21:14:00,337,"I fish my favorite ""secret lake"" with a 10ft jon & 30lb Minncota,I have a Group 27 deep cycle from CTC that has served me well for years,just make sure you put on a charger & top it up after each use."
779701,Roy,2013-04-14 21:16:00,13728,Go to Costco and pick yourself up a Kirkland group 27 deep cycle battery and you be good to go.
779703,Sinker,2013-04-14 21:34:00,8692,"More important than the battery, get a proper deep cycle battery charger, and make sure to charge your battery after every use.  Brand of battery isn't really important, but a group 27 size will suit your needs, and then somme.  The kirklands from costco are great, and the price is right!  S."
779704,mukluk,2013-04-14 21:37:00,196, Mines in its 5th year and still going strong.   Price was right as well.    I keep a trickle charger on it as well during winter months.   Helps to keep it from sulphating.
779712,scugpg,2013-04-14 22:10:00,1373,27 series deep cycle from costco will be a good choice along with a 30 - 45lb minnkota with digital maximizer technology.  Great battery life along with variable speed. Traxxis are nice models.
779719,John Bacon,2013-04-14 23:23:00,3277, 30 lbs should be fine for a 10' boat; but I don't think there is any downside to going with more thrust.  You can just use a lower power setting if want to slow down.  Some extra thrust may come in handy when turning into the wind.  I would try to get a motor with a built in Maximizer.  That will give you infinitely variable speed and longer battery life.  I have good luck with Energizer batteries which are pretty reasonable at Walmart.
779721,Roy,2013-04-14 23:42:00,13728,The Energizers at Walmart are now called Everstart. A great battery also.
779729,Shloim,2013-04-15 00:14:00,515,Just tried my new 30 lb motor today on the holland river in a 16 foot canoe . Had it running off a 31 Deka battery and it went all day with power to spare. Got it all at Lebaron $360 out the door with a Minn Kota battery box that had 2 lighter ports too for plugging other stuff too..
779747,Tony68,2013-04-15 01:01:00,31,I got either a 50 or 55 (can't remember right now) lbs thrust minnkota on my 12ft jon boat. This thing boogies full out. Like John Bacon mentioned comes in handy on windy days.
779927,super dave,2013-04-15 19:44:00,323,Do these kirkland deep cycle batteries require a top up of distiilled water after each use?  Do all deep cycles require this maintanence?  Sorry.  my knowledge of batteries is horrible.
779933,Sinker,2013-04-15 19:56:00,8692,"No, not after each use, with any deep cycle. You can go a whole season without adding any, and most do."
779938,super dave,2013-04-15 20:08:00,323,Thanks Sinker.
780034,Garnet,2013-04-16 01:12:00,2056,Everstart eco/core charge is $15 on a group 27- 850 so $87.98 +15  Cosco group 27-845 is 98.99 + 10 eco/core fee  So the cosco battery is $6 more.  No walmart had more than 1 and cosco Oshawa has 4 less.
