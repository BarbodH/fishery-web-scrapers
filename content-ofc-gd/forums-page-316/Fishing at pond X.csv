779711,aplumma,2013-04-14 22:09:00,6896,Had a good morning fishing for bass at pond X today. Lots of bites on jighead and worm combo. They were prespawn on the points with deep water near. I was looking for the pods of Crappie but they hide well from me.   Here was one of the big fish of the day        Art

779715,kickingfrog,2013-04-14 22:45:00,8333,"Do you think he knows that those measuring boards are ""special"" and are only sold to the tourists so they release more fish?"
779944,aplumma,2013-04-15 20:36:00,6896,Yaa know I believe yaa it has some kind of cheater numbers on the bottom that are like 2 for 1 inches.  Art
779960,misfish,2013-04-15 21:10:00,29133,why is the fish upsidedown? LOL  Nice
779985,aplumma,2013-04-15 22:55:00,6896,The back on this fish was huge and I couldn't get a good reading right side up. I can't wait for the Crappie to come up they are big and very tasty. The pond is 70% spring fed and the creek coming in is very clean and clear.   Art
