779414,fishindevil,2013-04-13 09:29:00,6254,I made the 65km drive to work yesterday morning at 4:30am and it was brutal both hwy 36 & 7 were a skating rink !!!!! Cars in the ditch as well and in Sunderland we went 6hours with no power lots of trees down as well !!!!!!! It was nasty drive for sure ...... Come on spring

779443,lew,2013-04-13 13:18:00,12766,"We went into town for dinner last night, as we do every Friday, and all the restaurants were full. Turns out alot of folks around here lost power so everybody went to town to eat. Infact the place we went to sold so many pizzas he ran outta pizza dough.  The restaurants all did a great business and the waitresses made more in tips than they would normally.  I spose what's bad for some of us, is a windfall for others."
779445,moxie,2013-04-13 13:22:00,1566,"With all the money spent on ""pie in the sky"" alternative sources(Windmills/Solar panels) instead of upgrading existing energy infrastructure you  can bet we ain't seen nothin' yet."

779720,Raf,2013-04-14 23:36:00,3495,Finally got power back at 5pm today.  It aint fun with a 10mos old.  Hope those of you still without get it back ASAP.

Big Cliff, I'd love to see your set up.  To be able to plug the whole house into the genny would be great.  I would really like a 200 amp manual (or auto) transfer switch, then just choose what breakers to run.  The alternative is to back feed through the dryer plug, but that is a no, no."
779227,Roy,2013-04-12 13:50:00,13728,"Started snowing about an hour ago here. Expecting 15cm  and 20cm in the elevated areas in the next 24 hours. The snowblower is away for the season but it'll be 6C tomorrow and 7C on Sunday so the stuff won't last long. Next Thursday we're expecting 18C ! (21C with the ""wind chill"" factor.)"
779229,SirCranksalot,2013-04-12 14:00:00,3291,I have a standby portable generator as well. The problem I see with an extended outage is that the gas stations have no power to pump gas. Or am I wrong about that? 
779230,ecmilley,2013-04-12 14:04:00,2163,lindsay pretty slickright now and still frezzing rain/rain mix
779234,ecmilley,2013-04-12 14:07:00,2163,"always try to keep 2 5 gallon jugs filled for the boat and sled as wellas the 1 gallon for chainsaw and a 2 gallon for lawnmower, and if all else fails i have a $20 manual transfer pump i could easily drain boat sled truck and all my neigbours fuel in no time"
779242,Entropy,2013-04-12 14:36:00,747,"Our local gas station / mechanic has pumped gasoline during an outage in the past.  Guess getting in close with him would be a good thing eh.  Also, we keep 80 L of gas on hand for this situation.  Genny uses about 10 L per 10 hours, so we can go for about 80 hours (3 and 1/3 Days), then it is time for siphon, or go get gas.  But, do I trust a cheap generator to run 3 days non stop?  Good question."
779244,SirCranksalot,2013-04-12 14:46:00,3291,  That's why I paid good bucks for a Honda rather than a heap CTC one. Who needs an unreliable gen in an emerg??
779248,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 15:13:00,6899,"Will check local conditions around 12:30 and let you know, sander just went by on our road but everything is covered with ice and it is still freezing rain as of 11:00 might be better if she can postpone her trip.  You are more than welcome to come by and see my setup anytime. It isn't anything fancy but we have tested it and it works well. I'm just North of Lindsay off 36 on Snug Harbour Rd. #313. Phone is 705-328-0577.  I'd rather have Lew's setup but couldn't afford it.  Our plan is to use the generator ""as required"" instead of running it all the time. ie, let it run for a couple of hours to pump water cool the freezers down, recharge batteries, that sort of thing rather than running it full time so a couple of tanks of gas will last us several days if needed. If the outage was bad enough one tank of gas in our little Versa gives me about 600 km, if I can't find someone with working gas pumps inside of 600 km then we'll just have to go into ""survivor mode"".  I have a bunch of those solar lights that I bring in the house to use for night lights anytime there is a bad storm coming, our gas fire place will keep the house warm at -25 if we need it. Lap top battery is good for several hours and I have a really good UPS for back up. I also keep all my boat and other batteries fully charged. Gas stove works even without power, I can cook eat, flush toilets, that is all I need LOL."
779257,Raf,2013-04-12 15:56:00,3495,"no hydro and lotsa trees down for us just southwest of orangeville. pretty obvious culprit tree blocking my road with hydro wires still atached on the way out this morning - had to go the other way. a generator would come in handy, hydro one's eta is 5pm today.  i heard grand valley got it pretty bad too"
779262,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 16:25:00,6899,"Just saw on the news over 100,000 without power.  It is still raining/freezing rain here, a good solid inch of ice on my driveway. I wouldn't be going out if I didn't absolutly have to. Stay home, stay safe, tomorrow is another day."

779279,lew,2013-04-12 17:46:00,12766,Our power has gone off 5 times so far today but only for a few seconds each time.  Lots of ice coating everything but it seems like it's finally switching over to just plain rain now.
779281,davey buoy,2013-04-12 17:57:00,5505,"And who said early yesterday evening,""what storm"" lol. Only 45 mins from TO and yesterday morning icy and bad but nothing till last night. WTH!!!!"
779287,ccmtcanada,2013-04-12 18:26:00,7971,Wow.  Sounds like it hit hard just to the north!  Down here in Whitby the car had a slight build up on it and patchy ice on the driveway.  The commute into Toronto was fine...just wet roads.
779288,Entropy,2013-04-12 18:27:00,747,"She stay'd home.  Tree branches were still coming down when she made her call.  Cliff, I'll take you up on that.  Should be giving you a call sometime over the next few days.  My sister just north of Bellville, said all her trees are down, power lines down, road is closed, now back up genny, and was going to go and try to get the kids from the day care place.  Good luck all."
779289,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 18:35:00,6899,"We lost power just as I was about to put some bread in the oven. Called Hydro, 5899 people without power in our area. Power expected to be restored by 11:00 pm tomorrow. Hooked up power pack to fireplace fan, lit BBQ to bake the bread, was just putting my coat on to go get generator ready to go and the power came back on. Sure feel sorry for the other 5898 people that will be without power until tomorrow night.  Temperature seems to be warming up rapidly now, ice seems to be melting and the rain seems to have stopped. If anyone on here knows of someone in this area (Kawartha Lakes) that is going to be without power for more than 12 hours please let me know, I'll trailer my generator to their place and at least give them a chance to run sump pumps or what ever they need. (All I ask is that they cover my gas) My cell is 705-928-8899, house is 705-328-0577.  Have generator, have time, will travel."
779291,davey buoy,2013-04-12 18:38:00,5505,"Cliff,what a generous offer!!!"
779292,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 18:39:00,6899," If your sister needs my generator I can get it to her, have Subaru Forester AWD with really good ice and snow tires and I can bring a chain saw for the trees that are down.  Just let me know!"
779297,lew,2013-04-12 18:53:00,12766,Ole Marv put on his best rain suit after lunch today to go out for his daily jaunt.    He made it 10' then turned around and came back into the house.  I think I heard him mumble something about me being nuts if I expected him to go out in that kinda weather.  
779309,Entropy,2013-04-12 20:02:00,747,"Thanks for the offer, but getting there would be the problem.  I'd buy one and take it to her, but she and her husband are the kind of people that ""should"" be resouceful.  Took a drive though Janetville, talked to a guy and he said that there are a lot of besements flooding.  Two of his neighbours.  Very big of you to offer.  Someone will return the fav. some day I'm sure."
779319,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 20:53:00,6899,Many on this board have helped me numerous times over the years and continue to offer anytime I need a hand with anything. It's me that is trying to return the favors and I've got a long way to go!
779366,SirCranksalot,2013-04-12 23:33:00,3291,Pretty serious around these parts this aft. Tried to stop at Tims for coffee but the sign said no service due to power failure. 
779067,Big Cliff,2013-04-11 21:26:00,6899,"Got up at 5 am, looked at the weather forecast, checked on here, had a coffee, checked the radar map and weather forecast again and decided I'd better cancel my plans for the day and go get extra gas for the generator and get it ready to go and put in a few extra supplies.  It is now 5:20 we haven't had a flake of snow, the 60K wind gusts that they said we were going to get hasn't happened, there hasn't been a single drop of freezing rain. I've lost a whole day of working on the docks, cancelled a friend coming over to check out putting a bowmount trolling motor on my boat. Darn you again weather person!!!!!!"
779068,Sinker,2013-04-11 21:33:00,8692,"Cliff, you should know better than to cancel plans due to the weather forcast. Its always hyped up. They cancelled all buses to schools this morning, and we haven't had a drop of rain or flake of snow here all day! What a joke!  S."
779070,davey buoy,2013-04-11 21:37:00,5505,"Watching Global news as I type,The main storm will be reaching Toronto about 9pm tonight and lasting well into tommorow. Freezing rain all night. Should be a nice trip to the big smoke at 5am in the morning."
779072,esoxansteel,2013-04-11 21:54:00,1307,"almost 6:00pm not a drop of rain in Peterborough, watched it on last nights 6:00 news, 24 hours later and still nothin  but the price of gas went up 12 cents a litre though, glad i filled yesterday at 116 per litre."
779074,Sinker,2013-04-11 21:55:00,8692,"Ya, that's what they said last night. As always, I'll believve it when I see it.  Anyone ever seen a newfie weather station? Its basically a piece of yarn you hang outside your window. It never lies. If its wet, its raining, if its stiff, its freezing, if its moving its windy.....if its gone, someone stole it! Never fails!!  S."
779075,misfish,2013-04-11 21:57:00,29133,   RIGHT ON BYE.
779076,lew,2013-04-11 21:59:00,12766," I hear ya Steve, I went into town this morning and when I passed the gas station he was $1.17 so I figured I gas up on the way back. Thirty minutes later, he was $1.27"
779083,Rich Clemens,2013-04-11 22:45:00,3131,10 cents a litre that quick .... That seems insane.  That's like a 38 cent per gallon hike down here.  Can't say I've seen that kind of a jump at one time
779132,moxie,2013-04-12 00:55:00,1566,Almost 9. Still not a drop in Durham.
779133,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-12 01:09:00,8243,"I wouldn't be so sure, they are sneaky smart that way.  Forgot the newbie weather joke, still funny after all these years.  Rain, wind and hail here yesterday, was looking in the yard and the water was up to the wheel hub on my boat trailer. I wish I could post a pic here, I'm computer useless.  Then I was looking out the back later and saw an old guy in a long wooden boat float by, there was the head of a giraffe sticking out the top."
779143,BillM,2013-04-12 02:02:00,17367," Check out wundergroud.com  Great weather maps...  The southwest is getting it right now, all of south/central Ontario will be getting it early tomorrow morning."
779149,Moosebunk,2013-04-12 02:12:00,3970,My oldest says her school used up all it's weather days this year.  Ummmmm... OK!   Probably because bluebird sky cancellations ate up half of 'em.  Anyways... got my FOGHAT going... Slow Riding tomorrow all... take it easy on the way to work.
779157,Entropy,2013-04-12 02:37:00,747,"Still nothing here, but they say it is still coming.  Darn, might make it into work tomorrow.  .........   Do I have to? lol"
779162,moemoe,2013-04-12 02:54:00,352,freezing rain here in caledonia now
779182,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 09:11:00,6899,"Well, it's here! Everything covered in ice as of 5:00 am and still coming down. It's a mix of ice pellets and freezing rain. Got the bath tub filled with water just in case we loose power, filled every gas can I have yesterday and test ran the generator just in case we are without power for a couple of days (remember the Quebec ice storm?) I understand there are a lot of power outages all ready so better safe than sorry.  Sit tight and stay safe everyone."
779188,Entropy,2013-04-12 09:56:00,747,"Geee, Big Cliff.  Sounds like you might just be a (dare I say) a Prepper.  I did just the same thing over the last 2 days and am glad I did.  Generator is running. Wish I had a spare one, as back up. Calling in sick in 15 min. I can smell the bacon now.  Be Safe."
779192,lew,2013-04-12 10:44:00,12766, Get yourself a permanent standby generator and you won't have to worry about it again. Mine runs off propane and automatically starts up 15 seconds after the power goes out and stops when it's restored. It pretty well runs my entire house if I wanted it to.
779197,Entropy,2013-04-12 10:56:00,747,"lew, that would be great, but with a young family and home repairs / updating needed, I can't justify the .... how much $5000?  Now if I have water damage in my basement, I'm sure my insureance co. will make me get one."
779198,lew,2013-04-12 11:02:00,12766,"It was around $3300 if I recall correctly, but worth every $$$$.  Just about everyone on my road has one."
779203,Entropy,2013-04-12 11:45:00,747,"Knowing me I'd still have a small gasoline back up.  If the stand by doesn't kick on, the $300 Crappy Tire one would be next."
779204,Big Cliff,2013-04-12 11:47:00,6899,"That is a lot less than I thought it would be Lew. When I looked into it for our place they wanted about $1,400.00 just for the automatic control panel and almost $4,500.00 for the generator. I ended up buying a portable gas one for about $700.00 and $300.00 to have a manual switching panel installed. That was 4 years ago and the only time I had to use it was to help Beans out a couple of years ago when he lost power for a few days. I still fire it up every couple of months just to make sure it is there when I do need it and drain the fuel and put fresh gas with stabilizer in it every fall.  Still nice to know I have it if I need it though. Mine is 6500 watts and will run the whole house with no problem, I do have a gas range in the kitchen, gas hot water heater, gas fireplace, gas furnace. About the only thing I do need power for is to be able to pump water, run the freezers, and lights, I could probably have gotten by with a smaller generator but this one was a good deal."
779207,lew,2013-04-12 12:01:00,12766,"When I purchased the generator Cliff, I also bought a new gas furnace & on-demand water tank to get away from oil so all the prices are running together in my head right now, so I may be off on the price.  Here's the generator tucked nicely under the back deck    this is the transfer switch    And the 1500 litre propane tank    Before this unit I ran a 6500 watt portable that plugged straight into the house and as you say, their also a great unit and do a nice job, I just wanted to get away from having to be here to keep the gas tank topped up.  We lost power 2 years ago for 2 days and the portable cost me $100 in gas, but still better than the alternative."
779211,misfish,2013-04-12 12:29:00,29133,Dat  ice was tick on da car tis morn. Almost needed a jack hammer.
779213,BillM,2013-04-12 12:45:00,17367,"My car is sleeping in the garage right now, ice free!!   But yeah, she's slick out there this morning..  Be careful boys."

778663,Entropy,2013-04-10 01:27:00,747,"Seriously! ---- Thurs, Close to 20 cm of snow ---- Fri, Close to 10 cm of snowGot the snow tires off the van, got rid of the little 4x4 SUV (got a little 2wd car, no snows either), and prep'd the snow blower for summer storage. LOL. Hey, at least the generator is ready to go, and a good thing too with all the ground water, if the power goes out that sump pump needs to keep going.Ice pellets and freezing rain likely Thursday. A series of low pressure systems will give periods of rain to the regions into Wednesday night. On Thursday, a stronger low will arrive from the southwest and combine with a colder airmass from the north. As a result rain is expected to change to ice pellets and freezing rain Thursday morning. The ice pellets and freezing rain are expected to persist through Thursday night and be heavy at times. Poor travel conditions are expected Thursday. In some places, power outages may occur. Conditions are expected to improve Friday. There is still some uncertainty as to the track of the storm and the extent of the cold air Thursday. Environment Canada will monitor this situation closely and will issue warnings as needed as the track of the storm becomes more certain."
