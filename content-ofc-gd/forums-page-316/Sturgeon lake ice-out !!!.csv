780212,fishindevil,2013-04-16 22:37:00,6254,Took some pics of the lake when I got home from work tonight !!!! What a difference in the last 24hrs !! The wind is really breaking it up today ... Should be all gone by the weekend .... There is actually whitecaps in the middle !!!! Almost fishing time... Woo hoo
780219,snagged,2013-04-16 23:27:00,67,Does the ice disappear from the middle of the lake towards the shore or the other way around? Silly question but I've never been around an iced lake to observe. Thanks
780276,fishindevil,2013-04-17 07:26:00,6254,It always starts in the middle at the area I'm on and then the wind usually carves a bigger hole and then it starts moving the ice sheet around some people across the lake are getting ice ramming their shoreline from the wind

780511,Big Cliff,2013-04-18 10:25:00,6899,"Still some ice out on the main body of the lake as of last night but this rain this morning should pretty much take care of that. Got the marine railway hooked up yesterday, I may try to put my first section of dock in this afternoon then I can put the boat in the water and fet out there and do some fishing.  So far reports I have gotten from a few friends are telling me water temperatures are at about 42Â° and the long range forecast is showing us staying well below normal for the next two weeks at least.  So far, no reports of the crappie showing up in a few of our favorite spots as of yesterday. Soon though I hope!"

Its going to be WEEKS before I see any open water, still 34-36"" of ice under my hut......3-4 feet of snow in the bush, and they just issued a heavy snowfall warning.....another 20-30cm today and tomorrow!!!"
780711,t4runner,2013-04-19 03:45:00,37,Awesome! Can't wait to put the boat in the water!!!
