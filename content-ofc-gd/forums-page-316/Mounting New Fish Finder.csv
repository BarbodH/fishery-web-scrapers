780158,reelinrolly,2013-04-16 17:51:00,281,"Hey guys  Had a few questions regarding the mounting of a new fish finder  I have a Nitro X 4 that came with a factory lowrance unit built rift into the console.   My new fish finder won't be able to be mounted in my console   I also want to keep te original unit there for when I trade the boat in  My new finder is an 898 HD SI Humminbird. I want to mount it on the starboard side of my console,  is a ram mount my best option??  Or are there other options available. Are ram mounts adequate for rough water, hate to lose my new fish finder lol  The mounting space I have at the side of my console is limited.  When drilling into the fibreglass,  are self taping fasteners adequate or would bolts be the better option??  Thanks for any tips guys"

780195,BillM,2013-04-16 20:44:00,17367,I'd definitely bolt it.. that's a lot of $$$ your talking about
780214,lowerunit,2013-04-16 22:59:00,53,"Have the 898 and i did the same with the stainless bolts, also get the big ram mount so it stays where you lock it down. I think its the 2 1/2"". I tried the smaller ones and it would drop no matter how tight you tried. Bigger is better."
780228,reelinrolly,2013-04-17 00:42:00,281,Right on  Thanks a lot guys for the tips.  I can't wait to try it out!!!
