780021,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-16 00:39:00,2582,"I'm sure your right Rich. I have only had largies from shallow waters in the heat of summer.  I have however had smallies in May from ""up north"" where there is no closed season and they where awesome."
780176,aplumma,2013-04-16 19:12:00,6896,Take them and cut them into boneless chunks soak in milk and lemon juice for 4 to 6 hours. Flour then egg dip them then fish fry mix and deep fry them. MMMMM MMMM good.  You can make any fish taste bad if you cook it wrong lol.   Art
780180,Ben_Daniels,2013-04-16 19:30:00,435,"They're in the Toronto Islands, I've caught a few using bass lures. They put up a GREAT fight. You can see them guarding schools of fry in the spring, cool thing to see. They also have awesome colors when they're spawning! "
780181,davey buoy,2013-04-16 19:38:00,5505,"Maybe this will be the year for me?,sounds like a awesome fight."
780183,jimmer,2013-04-16 19:39:00,2730,Waubashene has some good ones. We did catch some out of Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park up by Killbear. I don't think they are any good to eat though. They eat everything.
780184,Gerritt,2013-04-16 19:40:00,6129,Ugly looking suckers
780234,MCTFisher9120,2013-04-17 01:15:00,3761,"I have many pictures with those suckers, biggest ones were in the 7lb range for me. Here is one from last summer frogging off shore one evening. was in the Gananoque area, they love slop frogs the dam things. Always get me excited thinking I hooked into a giant largie but then I realize I have a giant dogfish on the line. North Kingston lakes, shallow water look for slop and pads...  "
780240,knightfisher,2013-04-17 01:28:00,237,"Caught two bowfin In Caledonia from shore by the dam, about two pounds.  Also caught two bowfins in the Ausable river that goes through the Pinery near London. Those ones were eight and nine pounds and fought like pikes.  All four were caught with dead minnows under a float.  I was targeting pike"
779355,Locnar,2013-04-12 23:06:00,645,"As I have never caught one, nor seen one in person... I'd like to try to hook into one this year. Is there anyone knowledgeable in Bowfin fishing? Any tips are appreciated. I have no idea where to look, when to look... I do believe they are a warm water species, and the only lake that I know holds them is big ol Lake O. Any others that might increase my chances? PMs are more than welcome if you don't want to the world to know any specifics or anything. Obligatory, ""Not looking for honey holes""... just something to set me in the right direction.  Thanks"
779360,Steve,2013-04-12 23:11:00,2075,"this is what i suggest.  once bass opens, go to bay of quinte.  get into the shallows, especially around muskote bay (part of big bay).  use exactly what you would use for bass, and you likely will catch some bowfin.  they fight way harder than bass, and are way meaner. the two biggest bowfin we caught came on a spinnerbait fished in between thick weeds and a pulse worm swam ontop of lilly pads. the second one hit three times in a row before I managed to hook it...  there are also some lakes in bruce county with even better numbers, but i'm less familiar with them.  they fight real strong and are likely more fun to catch than many of our ""sport fish"".  also, the grand river gets a nice bowfin spawn in about 3 weeks time. go into the shallows, very shallow (less than 3') and use dew worms. the males will have their spawning colours...bright neon green fins.  hope this helps.  bowfin are awesome fish!"
779361,Roy,2013-04-12 23:16:00,13728,Yes they are awesome. Just don't be lipping them.
779365,Locnar,2013-04-12 23:28:00,645,"Thanks guys, I will have to try to get out to the BoQ or the Grand this year. I've never fished either, so it'll be interesting. I heard somebody say that the Holland River gets them in the spring... anyone able to confirm that?  Also, the Grand River is quite large... would you suggest trying closer to mouth at Erie?"
779375,livinisfishin,2013-04-13 00:34:00,661,Georgian bay up my way has some good sized ones ..
779392,OX!,2013-04-13 01:42:00,6,Bumped into a handful last summer at the Toronto islands
779396,Garfisher,2013-04-13 02:06:00,229,"Holland River would likely have em, they spawn in May. They'll hit a variety of stuff, full nightcrawlers are probably the simplest bait to use for them (and they rarely refuse nightcrawlers). Set the hook hard when they bite, they have pretty bony mouths. The gular plate that bowfin have (under the mouth, gills lead to it) is a good spot to get ahold of them, however I wouldn't suggest lifting them by it. Just use it to get ahold of the fish and then support the fish with your other hand. Grabbing them like pike using the gill plate would be another way to grab them, or a net would do the job as well lol. They are pretty tough to grab otherwise"
779409,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-13 04:15:00,2582,I sight fish them in about a month's time  on Simcoe up near Orillia. A chunk of worm on a jig head. Walk along the bank and  they are right there in 2 feet of water. Drop the jig head right in front of there faces and they grab it every time. My son used to love going after Bowfins with me. Then we would spend the rest of the time catching bullheads under a float.
779412,Freshtrax,2013-04-13 05:47:00,2215,Holland river has a few.
779416,Rich,2013-04-13 09:57:00,3927,"I have always wanted to catch one too. I've been bit off by them a few times tossing senkos on Long Point Bay, or broke off, not sure. But never have seen a real big one there. The grand sounds interesting, i wish I knew the specifics of that cuz I fish the grand all year and have only ever seen one, and it was through the ice in dunnville. Any more info on the grand?"
779432,aplumma,2013-04-13 12:39:00,6896,They also like the dense vegetation I use a weedless frog that makes a racket when pulled thru the holes and open spots of topwater lilies. Use a stiff rod and stout line though because the first thing they do is take you down and thru the jungle of weeds. I fish this style for snakeheads down here in Virginia and it works like a champ.   Art
779435,OhioFisherman,2013-04-13 12:52:00,6623," There seemed to be a good number of them around Pointe Au Baril, we never intentionally fished for them but they were an incidental catch quite often when using live bait. Never caught one on a lure, never saw a small one, average size seemed to be between 4 - 6 pounds. I netted one for a buddy though that was pushing 20 pounds, a tank, and a good fight."
779437,jeffw,2013-04-13 12:57:00,267,I have caught them slop fishing for bass at the bottom of cooks bay in the summer
779481,RJackson,2013-04-13 17:13:00,113,Lakes North of Kingston have em with the Ontario record coming from Dog Lake.  I've caught a handful while bass fishing on a flippin jig.  They are a really cool fish and once ya spot em they aren't too tough to convince to eat.  St. Lawrence also has a great population!  RJ
779483,mike rousseau,2013-04-13 17:37:00,4661,There's a small pond attached to the st.lawrence that gets a good run of them.... I used to fish bullhead there... One day I saw 10+ caught in a few hours on a hook and night crawler.....  Also... I've seen them in several creeks on the st.lawrence... Like others have  said... Very aggressive... If you spot one I'd be very surprised if you ccouldnt catch it...  I've caught em on weedless frogs... Texas rigged worms...  Spinnerbaits...  Jigs...  I've even seen em eating fish guts in the boathouse after cleaning fish...
779486,davey buoy,2013-04-13 17:48:00,5505,I'm surprised the areas I fish I haven't hooked into one yet!  .
779585,northernpike56,2013-04-14 01:36:00,717,thats how I tried to hold my first one for a picture.  I think i bled for about 10 mins :S
779586,northernpike56,2013-04-14 01:40:00,717,"also use a leader, they have bigger teeth then pike"
779589,Locnar,2013-04-14 01:50:00,645,"So, a wire leader then?"
779597,Gallie,2013-04-14 02:25:00,1215,The holland river and cooks bay are good spots to look especially in the spring. They love warm water and weeds and are usually shallow. Worms or other organic baits are the way to go. I used to catch them at night under a bridge near washago with tiger shrimp. They have a ton a of tiny razor sharp teeth and a heck of a grip so spreaders might be a good idea for unhooking.i live on the canal and usually catch a couple while fishing for bullhead in spring. Hope this helps good luck!
779619,aplumma,2013-04-14 11:21:00,6896,Since no one has mentioned it yet. The flesh is  firm and white and tastes very good.   Art
779860,ch312,2013-04-15 15:19:00,1590,"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Bowfin/Bowfin.html  The bowfin is commonly known as cottonfish in some parts, due to the fact that when they are improperly cooked or eaten cold, the flesh is said to ball up in one's mouth like cotton. Food critics have given ""Cajun caviar,"" a delicacy made from the eggs of bowfin, rave reviews. Reviews regarding the flesh of the bowfin range from ""soft and pasty"" to ""passably palatable, while being one of the best of all smoked fishes"". The bowfin is commonly used as laboratory test animal because of its status as a ""living fossil."" It is easy to maintain and has interesting behavioral and physiological temperaments. Young bowfin may be kept in an aquarium, however they may feed on smaller fish.    i've never heard of smoked bowfin. who's going to be the OFC guinea pig?"
779923,Locnar,2013-04-15 19:33:00,645," If someone wants to help me catch one in relatively clean waters, then okay... I'll volunteer."
779929,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-15 19:48:00,2582,My neighbor at the cottage can make ANYTHING taste good in his smoker. If I get one up to him I will give an honest report. I have tried bowfin just cooked and it was terrible....kinda tasted like largemouth bass...but worse.
780015,Rich,2013-04-16 00:15:00,3927,"You'd have to eat it while the water's still pretty cold, i'd imagine. Anything that lives in shallow/warm water usually has mushy meat. Largemouth from deep water in the fall are wonderfully delicious."
