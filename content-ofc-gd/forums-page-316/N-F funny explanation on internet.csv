779804,pikehunter,2013-04-15 11:56:00,1659,Just googled Victoria Day to figure out when it falls this year and found this.  Victoria Day is a Canadian statutory holiday celebrated on the Monday preceding May 25. It honours Queen Victoria's birthday. Victoria Day is also commonly called the May 2-4 weekend (as in May 24th) and it marks the unofficial start of the cottage season where cases of beer (as in 2-4 cases) are consumed by hard working Canadians.  May 2-4 will be here before we know !  Better get a head start on stocking up!

779808,pikehunter,2013-04-15 12:22:00,1659,"Naw, it'll still be good, all that imported beer in the LCBO is months old and it sells for a premium price! I've had beer on hand for a month or more with no issues...or are you just saying that going skunky is a good reason to drink it up now so your wife won't get mad at you for drinking it all up in a weekend lol"

779866,Toad Hunter,2013-04-15 15:29:00,261,"Most beers have a shelf life of 90 days to assure its best taste... but this can change dramatically based on exposure to UV rays (bottle color makes a big difference), pop top vs twist top, and all the preservatives added as well..."
