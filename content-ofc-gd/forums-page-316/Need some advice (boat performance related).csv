780204,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 21:37:00,318,"Yeah im just sticking to the 14 footer fury, when there are 3 ppl in the boat we would be bogged down anyways cause it would be for camping trips, which we don;t actually fish from the boat just need it to get to the island then we fish from shore"
780264,Freshtrax,2013-04-17 03:03:00,2215,There's probably a real nice 14-16 ft naden kicking around here somewhere cough cough
780048,woodenboater,2013-04-16 01:35:00,2277,"your options are a) buy a boat to suit the 20 or  buy the larger boat then upgrade the motor later or c) wait for the boat you paid for and see if they'll cut a break on delivery or throw something in since it's late  if it were me in your shoes, I'd buy a 14 which should be fine for 2 people. I've found 14's with 20 on the back run nice. wouldn't wanna run big water in that though"
780049,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:36:00,318,"Well il never be on the great lakes with it, Im up in northern ontario so most lakes im on around around 1000-2000 hectares with the biggest one I go on being roughly 5000 hectares, but even on that lake my uncle has a 17 footer with a 90 so I would rarely have to take mine out on it. I'm on rivers a lot too as well."
780050,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:36:00,318,I was going to try and get a deal on an upgrading model since they were late.
780053,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:37:00,318,I must also point out this tiller model I'm looking at is rated for a 25 hp
780054,Raf,2013-04-16 01:39:00,3495,I didnt realize you switched boats.. the boat rated for a 25 will be just fine with a 20.  the boat rated for a 40 may struggle with the 20.
780057,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:42:00,318,"Yeah the 16 foot console steering model was rated for a 40 hp, the 14 ft tiller is rated for 25 which is odd considering they are only about a 50 lb difference."
780058,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:44:00,318,"http://www.boatsville.com/boats/mn/deerwood/alumacraft/179973   here is what the boat looks like that I am interested in switching my delayed one for. Ironically enough this one it sold with a 20 hp too haha, it seems like it has a flat enough bottom in the rear that a 20 would run adequate on it."
780060,jedimaster,2013-04-16 01:48:00,3472,Just make sure you are getting the right size teansom... long shaft versus short shaft. Don't fet stf with a boat and motor that don't match.
780063,Fang,2013-04-16 01:49:00,1330,"I ran a Lund16 Aluminum for several years with a 25 HP Johnson. Great set up and I could get 22 MPH with me, a gas tank and some fishing gear. It was a basic three bench seat nothing fancy. As soon as I got fancy and put a front and back casting platform in, livewell, bow mount and transom trolling motors and 3 batteries did I realize I should have bought a 40.  If it'll be a basic open aluminum it'll be fine."
780065,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:51:00,318,"yeah the motor I bought is a longshaft, now to call them tommorow and see if they happen to even have one of these in stock haha"
780067,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 01:52:00,10439,I think that boat with your motor will be a good match!!
780072,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 02:05:00,318,"Glad to hear, once you got a look at it, now hopefully they have one of those in stock or it looks like i will be waiting regardless haha"
780085,porkpie,2013-04-16 02:55:00,2521,"You really won't be happy, and it's false economy.  I used to run a 16 foot tinner, with snap in floors and nothing else.  No rod lockers, no hatches no casting decks.  Just a troller up front, 2 downriggers and a couple of batteries.  The boat was powered by a 30hp 2 stroke.  It was great with just me, but if I had 2 passengers and a load of gear, I had to slap a different prop on in order to get up on step quickly and of course i lost top end this way. That same 30hp 2 stroke was on a 14 foot boat previously, and that boat had floors, rod lockers and hatches as well as a raised casting deck.  The boats ran roughly the same speed, as all the extra wood in the 14 weighed it down.  The 30hp 2 stroke did all I needed for the most part, on a pretty plain Jane 16 foot tin boat with a floor installed, but a 20 would have been barely getting by.  You put that same 20 on a heavy 16 foot boat with floors and rod lockers/decks etc. and it will be a total dog.  Wait on your tin boat, or get dealer to deliver, or have him find you another utility that suits and is available now.  You will lose money trying to sell bits and parts later, and be less than happy with the performance in the meanwhile.  Just my opinion."
780149,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 16:32:00,10439,"The boat he is looking @ now has a maximum HP rating of 25 hp. It should be fine with his 20hp. But if he starts adding casting decks, lots of batteries etc performance will suffer of course."
780150,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 16:37:00,318,"I actually have decided to go with the lund fury 1400. It is rated for 30 hp however it is lighter and not quite as wide as the alumacraft so I'm guessing performance with the 20 would have been about the same between the 2 It already has a casting deck and stuff installed into it, and I would just end up having 1 battery to run the bilge,lights,fishfinder. If I feel like it needs more power I can look into that next summer, but this boat is a huge upgrade from my 1970's leaky 12 foot car topper with a older 15hp evinrude haha."
780159,bare foot wader,2013-04-16 17:52:00,1354,"if you're not concerned about top end performance, then get the boat you want knowing you'll be underpowered (less or more depends on which hull you decide on). If it proves to be lacking too much for you, sell the o/b next summer and upgrade, your 2011 4stroke will hold good enough resale value. But it is always cheaper to do it right the first time around.  it sounds like all you want to do is get on plane and cruise, not win any races  you can play around with hydrofoils, smart tabs, prop pitches  before you flip the o/b too"
780162,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 18:13:00,318,"Yeah that's exactly it, as long as I can plane and cruise I'm fine with it. Im not looking to beat anyone to any fishing holes. Besides a lot of the Northern Ontario Lakes I fish are loaded with unmarked rocks and shoals so I'm rarely running top speed to begin with because we always need to keep our eyes open. I ended up calling the dealership today and buying the Lund Fury 1400."
780167,davey buoy,2013-04-16 18:50:00,5505,"That is your best choice I believe.Fish from it this season,and see what you can do next year. After using the 20hp for a season,heck,you might think it does well for what you want to do.JMO."
780171,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 19:04:00,318,"Well I officially caved in this afternoon and went with the lund fury 1400 haha, it came with 2 pedestal seats so my next question is. Are those pedestals universal? I don't feel like paying for another lund seat and I have plenty of seats at home I was wondering if I could just buy a pedastal from BPS and it would work for the boat. Just to be prepared for the 2-3 time I will actually have 3 people in the boat LOL."
780174,davey buoy,2013-04-16 19:10:00,5505,"Not positive,but would like to think there is a industry standard."
780193,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 20:37:00,10439,There are a bunch of different types of pedastals. More than likely you will be able to get what you need through Bass Pro or Cabelas. When you get your boat just compare what it comes with and the ones on the stores websites.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/browse/boating-boat-seats-pedestals-bases/_/N-1100617/Ns-CATEGORY_SEQ_104492880?WTz_l=DirectLoad%3Bcat104794380%3Bcat104705280  http://www.basspro.com/Boating-Marine-Accessories-Boat-Seats-Boat-Seats-Furniture/Type-Seat-Mounts-Pedestals/_/N-1z0ux8qZ1z0v4mx
780194,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 20:44:00,318,Thank you!
780197,jedimaster,2013-04-16 20:54:00,3472,"Some are screw in, some are keyhole and some are just pressure fit. Wait til you get your boat and make sure you get the right ones."
780199,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 21:06:00,318,"Yeah for sure, I'm in no rush at all, water probably won't even be open up around Timmins for another few weeks anyways haha."
780201,mike rousseau,2013-04-16 21:20:00,4661,If you plan on fishing more then 2 people you'll need the 16' for space... Not performance...  If you fish solo... Or 2 in the boat... 3 people a few times a year...I'd get the deepest widest 14 footer you can... Without decks...  I had a 25 Suzuki on my 16' Lund explorer when I bought it used...  It was great alone... Got 25 mph... And my boat has decks and live well and everything... But 2 people it was sluggish... And dropped to 20mph... 3 people was a no go....
779972,Tayzak15,2013-04-15 22:26:00,318,"Well this past winter I had decided to purchase a new engine and boat. Well I'm from Timmins and I purchased through a dealer in Orillia because they gave me the best price. It was an Alumacraft v16. Well sure enough today I get a call telling me the boat won't be in for a couple of weeks (I ordered 2 1/2 months ago) at the time they said they would have it by April 18th (the day im moving back to Timmins). I have already bought a 20hp 4 stroke mercury that I was planning to use for it, but now I'm considering looking at a Lund Fury or Alumacraft fisherman because I don't feel like travelling back down here to pick up the new boat once it does come in. So my question here is what kind of performance do you guys think I would get with a 20hp powering either one of these boats? both of them weigh in the 500-600lb range and usually have 2 people in the boat. I'm not looking to be a speed demon with it as long as I can get about 20mph or higher I would be happy. Just wondering if anyone has any similar setups or experience  thanks in advance for replies!"
779981,Sinker,2013-04-15 22:47:00,8692,"I don't think 20hp is enough for any of those boats. The 16 lund fury is rated for a 40. A buddy of mine has one, and after running it quite a bit, I wouldn't go any less.  I can't say much for the alumacraft, but you will not be happy with an under powered boat, and it can be out right dangerous in the wrong conditions.  S"
779982,Rob,2013-04-15 22:51:00,467,"I think you are under powering the boat with that size engine. Look at the boat's HP rating and go with that if you can. I am assuming you are going with a tiller motor?I would always try to max out the motor size on the boat, but that's just me.  Rob C"
779983,BillM,2013-04-15 22:51:00,17367,20hp is going to be extremely anemic on those boats.   40HP 4stroke would be the ticket.
779984,Tayzak15,2013-04-15 22:53:00,318,"Looking online for the tiller models I know the alumacrafts are rated for a 25hp, and the 16ft lund fury was rated for 40 and I believe the 14 foot is rated for 25 or 30. Again, I'm not looking for huge speed just anything around 20mph or around that with 2 people."
779987,jedimaster,2013-04-15 23:02:00,3472,I have a 30 2stroke and I am very happy with the performance. a 20 would be nothing less than anemic.
779989,davey buoy,2013-04-15 23:07:00,5505,He bought the 20hp. What can he do now?.Speed was not a factor so he said..
779991,buick14,2013-04-15 23:09:00,741,"I have a 2-stroke merc 20hp on a deep wide tiller full floor/casting deck prince craft pro just under 15ft weighs about 500lbs.  Max hp is like 30-35, the 20 goes about 25-30km on mine with those specs.  Have been in the same boat with a 40 and it move like a batt outta heck"
779993,Tayzak15,2013-04-15 23:15:00,318,"Yeah I bought the 20 hp earlier this winter because I had put an order on a 16 ft alumacraft utility boat, which only weighed about 300lbs, but they called today and said it won't be in on time so I'm considering just calling back tommorow and seeing if they have the next model up which would be the alumacraft fisherman or lund fury. So I can just grab it as I move back up to Timmins rather than moving back this week then coming back down here in a couple weeks to pick the boat up. Most lakes/rivers I fish are relatively small however there's a couple big ones I fish the largest being about 5000 hectares. I may upgrade later on, if I went this route, but I did just buy the motor this winter and haven't even gotten the chance to use it yet.  keep the responses coming people! I have to make a decision within the next few days since I am moving back on the 18th and I was notified about this late shipment last minute."
779998,jedimaster,2013-04-15 23:35:00,3472,"If you are stuck with the 20 and can't go anything higher than try an keep the boat as lightly loaded as possible. To be honest with a 16 footer you are going to be right on the verge of not beaing able to get up on plane with it fully loaded. Actually to be honest I would be very  think if you have 4 adults with gear and battery, trolling motor you won't get plane without having to drop the prop pitch down. Going from one 16 to another if I was stuck with the motor I would try and get the boat with the flatest bottom. This should in theory put less boat in the water and help you get on plane when loaded. however the downside of a flatter bottom is of course a rougher ride when in choppy conditions. If you are doing smaller lakes and rivers, what about a 16 foot Vbottom john or duck boat? They will plane out a little easier.  Ar eyou planning on loading up with people etc?  For example. Mine is a 16 foot Lund with deck front and rear fand floors a fairly flat boat in the back but still considered a deep v. If I have 2 people in the boat it jumps on plane nice and fast. When fishing with 4 adults and gear, We have to start to balance the weight front and rear so we can get on plane. You may find you will need to try out a few props. Likely it came with a 12 pitch or so prop. If its slow to get on plane  see if you can drop a pitch or two and that should help. of course watch your rpm's and as you go down in pitch you wil lose top speed but you said that doesn't really matter.  I should mention with the 30 yamaha 2 stroke I can run 28mph alone but with 4 in the boat it really slows down alot. Weight management will be critical for you."
780001,Tayzak15,2013-04-15 23:40:00,318,"Yeah we usually have a light load, never more than 2 or 3 people MAX on rare occasions, its too bad because the 20 would have been perfect on the initial boat I ordered, but since it won't be here in time its led me to shopping around again considering the price difference between the fury's and fishermans compared to mine would end up equaling about the same after having to spend money on gas,hotel,food to come pick it up rather than just pick it up on my way home."
780003,spincast,2013-04-15 23:53:00,3279,"why dont you ask the dealer to deliver to Timmins - after all, they are late on delivery. If i hasnt left the factory yet, mMaybe you can figure something out with them, maybe a few extra bucks, maybe not. Either way, as the water up there is still hard, it aint like you will loose boat time waiting for the delivery."
780004,Luke V.,2013-04-15 23:53:00,286,Is it a brand new 20hp? If so see if u can trade it in with the dealer and get a boat/motor/trailer package before you move  As others have said your underpowered with a 20 Maybe consider a 14 footer the 20 would be great on a 14 footer
780005,Tony68,2013-04-15 23:55:00,31,"Go for the max hp rating for the boat, less than that you will be disappointed."
780006,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-15 23:56:00,4399,Can't help with your question but I think it's pretty sad that it takes 3 months to get a plain jane tinny delivered!
780007,Tayzak15,2013-04-15 23:57:00,318,"Well if I went with the lund fury or alumacraft fisherman I would more than likely get the 14 foot model considering it has roughly the same beam width as the one I had ordered just these ones have the raised deck,livewell asll that stuff. As for spincast I might ask them that but would they deliver an alumacraft boat somewhere, where there is no alumacraft dealership? (theres none in timmins) The motor I bought was slightly used 2011 20hp 4 stroke merc with very low hours."
780024,chris.brock,2013-04-16 00:46:00,4053," not necessarily, I've got a 16, deep V, rated for a 40 hp max, it's got a 30hp triple 2 stroke and runs like a scared rabbit, it jumps straight up out of the hole"
780025,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 00:52:00,10439,If you're going to keep the 20 don't get a boat with casting decks and the like. Get yourself a 14'-16' utility boat like you were originally planning on. Plenty of other options out there.
780029,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 00:59:00,318,Chances are I would probably upgrade the following summer (the engine) but I am wondering if it would be tolerable for a summer pretty much? Just on a bit of a budget because I am still a student and have to have some saved up aside for when I return to school  in the fall.
780031,jedimaster,2013-04-16 01:06:00,3472," Same with me chris, mine is rated for a 40, I run a 30hp triple yammy. Its up on plane in short order.So much so i am going to be teting a higher pitched prop for when I am loaded light. As for the 20, it will no doubt push the boat. If its real bad like I said just get a lower pitched prop and upgrade the motor when you can. I would get the boat you want and then plan on upgrading the motor later. The only other good option is to buy a boat more suited to the 20hp like a 14 foot utility. Then sell the package later."
780033,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-16 01:09:00,10439,It might do for a summer but I would bet you try to upgrade before the fall. My 18' Fisher SV18-GT weighs in @ 900#'s dry and does mid 30's with a 90hp 2 stroke. I would bet your 500-600# boat would do mid to high teens. I spent many years driving under powered boats @ a lodge in the far north and was lucky to get over 18 mph with 3 people and gear in a 17' Lund. FYI that was with a 30hp OB.
780042,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:25:00,318,"Which is fine by me as long as it planes out, I mentioned earlier that I am out on my own quite a bit sometimes 2 ppl and rarely with 3, we usually never have much gear so it would just be gas, 1 battery, rods plus our tackle. The boat I am looking at now the alumacraft fisherman 145 is 14 ft 10 inches long and has a 73 inch beam."
780043,Raf,2013-04-16 01:28:00,3495,"I've a 14.5' tiller with casting deck, livewell etc. which i'd estimate is around 500-600lbs  and a 40 4-stroke -- it runs like a r a p e d ape.  It ran great with a 30 4str as well.  Although I did gain top end with the 40, the biggest difference I notice is the ease of getting up on plane when fully loaded and how little throttle I need to use to maintain cruising / plane.  The 30 was more than adequare, the 40 is the cats meow.  I suspect the 20 would be just ok with a light load and you'll likely be runnin full throttle but anymore than 2 reasonably sized adults and you will be struggling."
780045,Tayzak15,2013-04-16 01:30:00,318,"So you think it would be alright then? Im estimating between everything including motor,gear,myself and my buddy we would be running around 1100 lbs"
780047,Raf,2013-04-16 01:33:00,3495,I would not want to be out on the great lakes in that rig if I had to make a run to shore but I would say on smaller puddles it may be ok but just barely.  You will want either less boat or more motor after a season.
