779657,Roy,2013-04-14 16:12:00,13728,"So far, everything I have ordered from Cabela's has arrived at exactly the same price that I was quoted at checkout. No surprises."
779658,MJIG,2013-04-14 16:17:00,227," I'm not sure if this is the exact unit you are seeking , but it seems to be $1433.00 there is no shipping cost for super saver shipping and it is Canadian pricing at Amazon.ca. http://www.amazon.ca/Humminbird-407820-1-Waterproof-Chartplotter-Sounder/dp/B0032MUHI8"
779663,irishfield,2013-04-14 16:46:00,26272,If you go with the 858 combo.. there is a $100 mail in rebate that I just got an email about from Johnson Outdoors. Doesn't include the 898 though...
779665,Rich,2013-04-14 16:50:00,3927,"Why would you pay anything on delivery? I've ordered a LOT online, fishing wise, and have never had to pay anything at the door?"
779671,BillM,2013-04-14 17:22:00,17367," Wayne, like you said no rebate on the 898c model unfortunately...   It's come down to two units... The 898c HD SI or the 998c HD SI, now I just gotta figure out if the extra screen size is worth it or not, lol."
779756,Tony68,2013-04-15 01:44:00,31,"Bill M, I don't know if you've seen the 2 units up close, but I just returned the 898c in exchange for 998c for the simple reason the framing around the 898c seems to over power the screen size, making the screen look small. Now the framing around the 998c is a lot smaller which makes the screen look huge. Even thou it's only a 1 inch increase in screen size it appears to look a lot larger. Both units are the same size physically. Like I said I had some cash saved up + gift cards + the price match so it really didn't hurt that much. Was it worth the extra money for the 1 inch difference? I'm happy ."
779768,BillM,2013-04-15 02:49:00,17367," Yeah, the 898C and the 998C use the same physical casing..    The framing does make the 898c 'look' small, although I've gotta compare then side by side...  Either one is a killer unit no doubt about it."
779814,Harrison,2013-04-15 12:37:00,2202,"If $ is the bottom line large American corporations will win over a Canadian retailer almost everytime. Just the hard facts of retail in the great white north.  Especailly when buying US online, then shipping to a US address. Might as well be Florida buying it on vacation.  Anyone who has imported for resale in Canada will understand.  In the words of Bruce ""That's just the way it is""  Good luck on your search Bill"
779825,ADB,2013-04-15 13:07:00,444," I'm looking at getting a new fishfinder and the 858c HD DI is one of the options. When I saw it at Le Baron though it looked cheap simply based on the casing.  I know it's a great unit, but at first glance, it just looks cheap because you see a lot of plastic.  The 900 series looks a lot cleaner."
779859,Tony68,2013-04-15 15:11:00,31,"ADB personally I wouldn't bother with the down imaging, go side imaging, imo."
780229,BillM,2013-04-17 00:55:00,17367,"Looked at the 898c and the 998c today side by side, I don't think the extra $400 is worth it for the 998c.   If the 998c had a higher resolution then perhaps, but all you're getting is a bigger screen with the exact same data on it..  I'm surprised Humminbird did this to be honest.    Bigger screen, bigger fonts doesn't make much sense."
780230,misfish,2013-04-17 01:00:00,29133," It does,if you cant see so good,,,Like me."
780231,kickingfrog,2013-04-17 01:03:00,8333,Not without higher resolution.
780232,misfish,2013-04-17 01:04:00,29133," Yup,new wader boots will be here Friday,so they say.  Sorry Bill,didnt mean to derail your thread."
780235,BillM,2013-04-17 01:15:00,17367," No worries man, buying new stuff is always fun,regardless of what it is!  LOL!"
780237,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-17 01:26:00,10439, I agree!! Just ordered up some goodies for my boat. Finally bought the wireless setup for my Minn Kota and also picked up the universal sonar cable to hook up one of my finders in the front.
780239,BillM,2013-04-17 01:28:00,17367," I'm waiting on a Terrova 80lb 60in US2 with I-Pilot Link!!!!  And of course I gotta buy a new Humminbird to control it, lol!!!   My oldman just shakes his head when I tell him all the new stuff that's going on the boat..   Also gotta install my Depth Raider as well..  Going to be a fun year out on the water!"
780247,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-17 01:37:00,10439,"The funny thing is the co-pilot cost me more than the motor. I got a stupid cheap deal on a ""used"" one. A guy in town put his up for sale because he got it in his boat package when he bought it new in 2007. The TM had never been used in the 3 years he had owned it. Got the motor and the quick release mount for $150. It's a Gen V1 Minn Kota Powerdrive 80# 24V with Auto Pilot and Universal Sonar. SCORE!!!!! When it came up for sale on the local trader site I saw it 30 minutes after it was posted I couldn't get there fast enough!!!"
779448,BillM,2013-04-13 13:27:00,17367,"Hey guys, looking at upgrading the electronics on the boat.  Specifically looking at the Humminbird 898c HD SI to go along with the I-Pilot Link equipped Terrova I just picked up..   From what I've seen, I'll be dropping close to $400 more to purchase the same unit up here as I will in the US.   I'm all for supporting Canadian vendors, but not to the tune of an extra $400 out of my pocket.   I've been looking around for the past few weeks and it looks like I can get the unit I'm after for just under $1300 US.    If anyone can give me some suggestions on some Canadian retailers I should check out, I'd really appreciate it.  "
779452,kickingfrog,2013-04-13 13:49:00,8333,With the dollar at/near par for as long as it has been the price difference isn't as bad as it used to be on some things. Fishing electronics doesn't appear to be one of those things however. Good Luck with your search.
779456,Gerritt,2013-04-13 14:14:00,6129,"Have you tried giving Jos a call? I remember he was cheaper then the US when I purchased mine, and if I remember correctly if he wasn't he would price match.  Worth a shot"
779458,steverowbotham,2013-04-13 14:35:00,1800,Radio World is a great option for fishing electronics!
779463,Lunatic,2013-04-13 14:54:00,536,try grimsby tackle. the fish finders are cheaper then most places in canada
779465,BillM,2013-04-13 15:20:00,17367," $1500 + tax..   That's the first place I checked because I bought my trolling motor from them...      The killer here is the extra 13% on top...   I'm not expecting a retailer here to lose $$$ on the deal.  I'll give a Jos a ring as well, thanks fellas.  Like I said, I'd much rather buy it on this side of the border."
779468,Dan668,2013-04-13 15:45:00,1120,"If you don't mind used, good deals always pop up on BBC. Just picked up a hds10 gen 2 for 1300 shipped, year and a half left on warranty."
779474,moxie,2013-04-13 16:27:00,1566,Supporting Canadian retailers is a nice thought but in the end its' what comes out of your pocket that matters especially considering we are beaten nearly to death by taxes. Good luck.
779475,RickOnt,2013-04-13 16:33:00,669,That 13% can be a deal breaker for sure!!
779479,RJackson,2013-04-13 17:09:00,113,The best places in Ontario have been mentioned already.  How do you plan to get around the 13% when you hit the border or when you have it shipped up?  Also state sales tax is in play sometimes too.  Online deals out of the US often turn out to be not so sweet sometimes....just a heads up!  RJ
779488,adempsey,2013-04-13 18:08:00,1498,"Maybe here: http://www.gpscentral.ca/index.htm  Can't vouch for them though.  They are in Alberta, so as far as I know, they don't charge sales tax.   They do charge HST on shipping cost though."
779498,BillM,2013-04-13 19:00:00,17367," I've bought a few high ticket items in the US, no real big surprises when getting to the border.  For some stuff it's not worth it (Minn Kotas for example) but unfortunately the prices down there for sonar units is quite a bit lower then what you'll find up here.   I'll see what a Canadian retailer can swing for me, if they can't then I'll just grab it in the US.."
779500,misfish,2013-04-13 19:08:00,29133,"Bill,give Radio World a whirl. Just tell them the facts. You may get it. Then again,maybe not. I dont know what their price margine is,,but Im sure if they can swing it,they will.  Oh ya,do it in person."
779517,captpierre,2013-04-13 20:50:00,2521,Watch to see if warranty is valid here if bought in US.  Often would have to send to US for service
779522,cheaptackle,2013-04-13 21:02:00,849,"Something to consider that I've learned... In december I started working part time for a Canada Post Contractor - part of which involves delivering packages.  It seems customs is targeting anything with declared value over 100.00 and charging 9.95 for ""customs clearance"" plus HST on the shipment value.  Why do I know this - because I have to collect it at time of delivery!  You'd think people would be ready for this but NO!  Most of the time they take it out on me with comments like ""this never happened before""  or "" I thought I paid everything on line!"".  Just a heads up that you should plan on paying the 13% plus 9.95 for (minimum - additional tarriffs are charged on some items I've noticed) for anything you order outside canada now.  Oh - and please don't take it out on the driver - we're just doing a job!  If you don't pay - the package goes back to customs marked ""disputed"" and your charge card still has the purchase on it.  Michael"
779529,irishfield,2013-04-13 21:41:00,26272,"It also appears if you ship to a personal ""name"" you get hit for 13%.. a business they only charge 5% GST... so give that some thought when you have the seller label your shipment ""Billm Enterprises""....."
779536,cheaptackle,2013-04-13 22:13:00,849,"Think that may be more product related Wayne - I took 2 packages to our local ""famous"" tackle services guy and he got dinged 9.95 plus hst for rod/reel parts on each of them, while another package to a manufacturer containing ""machined parts"" was the 9.95 plus 5%.  On a personal note - product I brought in from the states for resale when I was still in the 400 market all got charged the 13% even though consigned to my business.  In short, as always, no consistency!  Michael"
779540,irishfield,2013-04-13 23:00:00,26272,"Yah it's a crap shoot.. my last shipment of parts, that I just received, was again only dinged for 5%, but the buggers in the Mississagua Customs facility kicked it around the warehouse from March 9th to April 4th costing me a customer that I promised finished goods for by March 30th. I thought maybe they thought my import was gun parts based on shape, but they didn't even open the box!"
779572,moxie,2013-04-14 00:53:00,1566,I have spent roughly $700 purchasing items from ebay in the last 12 months and have only been hit with a customs/HST charge only three times. Even with the shipping charges I have found that at the very least I save the taxes but usually more.  I'm just lucky i guess.
779594,BillM,2013-04-14 02:04:00,17367,"If I do buy in the US, I won't be getting it shipped to Canada.  It will be shipped to NY and I'll bring it over myself.   I'll definitely get dinged with duty/tax if I shipped a $1300 sonar here.  Then there's no point, I should just buy it here.  All my savings would go down the drain..  I just dropped quite a bit of money at Radioworld, maybe they'll swing me a deal on the Humminbird...  I guess the only thing they could say is no"
779600,Canuck2fan,2013-04-14 02:32:00,1444,"It might not be the retailer's in Canada that are charging more... Some companies have Canada in a high priced zone and so even if a retailer wanted to price match the States they are unable to do so because of how much they have to pay the importer. Shimano lost my business forever because this used to be their business practice for YEARS and YEARS. Once I verified that I switched to a company would sell to Canadian businesses for the same price as US businesses, even less when the Canadian dollar was above par. I haven't looked back since.  As for duty/taxes I have yet to find a hard and fast rule except to plan on paying it because you just never know if the person running the scanner at customs had a wife who treated him right before work that day or not..... Although BPS and Cabelas are always delivered to my door for the price I paid at checkout."
779602,Tony68,2013-04-14 02:43:00,31,"I just picked up that same unit at Bass Pro yesterday, only because I had about 300 bucks saved up on Bass Pro gift cards and Bass Pro matched Radio Worlds price."
779649,BillM,2013-04-14 15:19:00,17367, So you basically saved $100 on the unit after removing the tax.  Not a bad deal at all.   I need some more BPS giftcards!
779651,misfish,2013-04-14 15:25:00,29133," I,ll find out soon enough,as I made my first purchase from Cabelas."
779653,BillM,2013-04-14 15:41:00,17367," You already paid the tax at checkout, so I wouldn't expect any extra charges at your door when it shows up."
