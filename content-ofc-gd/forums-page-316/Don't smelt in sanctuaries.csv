The posted Four Mile Creek sanctuary is located within Fisheries Management Zone 11 and is closed all year to fishing for any species of fish. The sanctuary in FourMileBay, TroutLake, was put in place to protect young “smolt” (Atlantic salmon), which are nearly identical in size to smelt that also inhabit the creek during their spring spawning activities. The Atlantic salmon population in TroutLake is the only known naturally reproducing population in Ontario beyond the Great Lakes, and has been the focus of restoration efforts over the past 15 years.Some bodies of water, or parts of them, are declared fish sanctuaries for all or part of the year. Fish sanctuaries are put in place to protect fish populations during their most sensitive period. Since fish sanctuaries are not always marked with signs, anglers are encouraged to confirm regulation exception areas in the 2013 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary before going out fishing. Anglers can also contact their local Ministry of Natural Resources office.To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
