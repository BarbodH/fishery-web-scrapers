778636,irishfield,2013-04-09 23:34:00,26272,Yah we're on it guys... but some guy with a broken boat expects me to get up early on a weekend so he still has daylight to fish after it's all fixed. Not toooo sure about that...  lol
779670,irishfield,2013-04-14 17:12:00,26272,"Well as much as I hate getting up on a Sunday morning... Emil was right on time at 7:25 and the rush was on to get him out of here so he could be on the water by noon. So technically two things I hate.. getting up and rushing a job, but we got it done the best we could. Should last from here on out and if not the boat will fall apart around the repair.  The previous ""Marine"" repair facility that he paid good hard earned dollars to, that replaced this rivet twice, had buggered that hole up so much that I had to open it to 5/16 diameter to clean it up. Probably should have gone up to 3/8ths.. but at that size we may as well have put a rubber transom drain plug in the hole! lol  A short piece of angle to continue the exisiting angle down a bit, to give a few more rivet spots, and also to make the backer plate sit flush. A new hole drilled between each existing, some sealer and some new rivets.  5 out of 6 rivets almost the right colour to match the boat right out of my parts supply... the big purple one.. not so much!  Hopefully the fish were biting today......  ....oh and if you ever need a helper setting rivets, that Emil lad is pretty damn good at keeping the bucking bar square and in place!"
779673,bigbuck,2013-04-14 17:30:00,2449,Can anyone spell COMMUNITY??? Good on you Wayne. That boat should be good for quite a few more years.
779675,irishfield,2013-04-14 17:36:00,26272,BTW.. don't buy the 3M4200 quick cure at CTC.. very disappointing this morning to find it was already hard in the tube! Cutting the tube in the center got us enough to do the repair and the 2 hour cure hopefully happened before he launched in 2 hours and 5 minutes!
779677,BillM,2013-04-14 17:44:00,17367,Great job Wayne!
779686,irishfield,2013-04-14 18:30:00,26272,"Thanks Bill... not my cleanest work, rushing to get Emil back on the road, but nobody should have their head in the battery compartment to view it anyhow!"
779689,misfish,2013-04-14 18:32:00,29133,Yer SUPERMAN  Good on ya Wayne.   KARMA
779707,Loonietoon,2013-04-14 21:55:00,1450,way to go Wayne.. looks GREAT to me...
779784,icefisherman,2013-04-15 03:40:00,952,"Thanks again Wayne. Just got home...it was a loooooooong but good and satisfying day....boat is fixed fish is cleaned and in the freezer...Arnie is happy too...kids never stopped talking about your planes and every time one passed overhead while fishing today they kept saying here is Wayne flying over.... Same nice guy I remember from BOQ and from Temagami years ago...bit older but so am I ha ha....always ready to lend helping hand to a poor soul like me in need. Got to do something about the purple rivet ha ha ha....or I may keep it for good luck ;-) fish liked it today. Kids loved seeing so many airplanes in one spot and and just a hand away. And Wayne's truck got a free snow removal job....yes he still have plenty of snow around.....almost in May ;-) Have a feeling this is the last time this river gets touched....it was good call to drive the 2 hrs to Wayne instead of to the last place that ""fixed it twice""...checked it while on the water today by touching he area and rivets from inside the battery compartment to see if I feel any drops of wetness...nothing...all dry...just as promised ;-))) so quite happy and sorry for bothering you so early on the weekend.  Wish you all the best Wayne and hope to be able to return the kind gesture one day!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
779785,Gerritt,2013-04-15 03:51:00,6129,"One hand pays another...thats how it is supposed to work.  Good job Wayne, class act as always. Now Emil you pay that karma forward, god I love this site"
778194,icefisherman,2013-04-08 00:32:00,952,"Hi Guys,  can anyone recommend a place that can replace one rivet for me? Preferably in Mississauga/Oakville/Brampton/Milton/Burlington areas.  Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman  "
778198,captpierre,2013-04-08 00:40:00,2521,Ok.  A rivet.  Was wondering how one replaces a river
778201,Fisherman,2013-04-08 00:47:00,7201,"Kinda had me wondering too..If it's visible from both sides, it's not hard.  Otherwise you need a sealed blind rivet."
778212,icefisherman,2013-04-08 01:46:00,952,"OK Sorry...rivet of course...can't edit the title now... This particular one is a tough one...had a marine shop replacing it twice already this will be a third time. I can take it there again...but ...first it is too far from me and second I'd like to try someone else and hope for better result....So I'd rather have an expert do it...and yes it has access from both sides....but for some reason doesn't stay in place for more than an year. So anyone on the West side?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778217,kickingfrog,2013-04-08 02:01:00,8333,"Can't help with the rivet, but I can help with the river, I think. If you use the full editor you should be able to change the river/rivet."
778219,icefisherman,2013-04-08 02:17:00,952,"Got it thank you. Corrected.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778220,irishfield,2013-04-08 02:18:00,26272,"""Doesn't stay there""... where is this rivet located Emil?? Something's not right if it keeps disappearing....  Is it being sheared off on a trailer bunk? or what's the real story?"
778223,kickingfrog,2013-04-08 02:24:00,8333,Good. Figured rivet would get someone else ^ more interested then river.
778224,icefisherman,2013-04-08 02:33:00,952," Wayne,  the rivet is the highest of the three located vertically against the left console....for some reason the bottom two hold perfect but this third/highest one is giving me problems every year. Like I said it was already replaced twice (last year and the year before) and I need to do it again as it is moving when I push it with my finger. The rivet is in its place right now but moving.....It is not touching anything on the outside and I think it is The same on the inside. Hope this gives a better idea.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778226,irishfield,2013-04-08 02:37:00,26272,"Get me a picture so I can see what's around it. Parts are moving and this rivet is being sacrificed. Making it stronger may not be a good thing.. or may solve things. I won't be back on line 'till late tomorrow night or Tuesday am, at St. Mike's all day tomorrow."
778231,icefisherman,2013-04-08 03:04:00,952,"Wayne,  Appreciate your interest as I know you are an expert in those things.  Here is a picture taken before last years replacement...    and here is one I just took now...not very good uality as it is dark in the garage and did it with the cell    Sorry I said earlier it is the highest one of the three....it is actually the lowest of the three...my mistake... I'll do a better picture tomorrow and post it...and will try to take one from under the left console....it'll be tough to do a good picture there though as it'll has almost no light....will try anyways...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778245,zamboniwaterboy,2013-04-08 11:09:00,126,The best around is http://jandjmarine.com/.  Jim has been doing this for a long time.  If up Wahnipitae way swing by http://craigsmarine.ca/
778383,irishfield,2013-04-09 01:55:00,26272,Get me an interior picture when you can Emil.. some thing is shaking the crap out of the boat when you are either trailering or motoring on the water. I can't really tell where this rivet is with the pics you have supplied. Might be as simple as adding a couple more rivets... or maybe not!
778392,icefisherman,2013-04-09 02:19:00,952,"Wayne, here is a picture I took this afternoon of the rivet in question.  from outside:    from inside and under the left console:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778393,irishfield,2013-04-09 02:23:00,26272,"Okay.. I understand it all now. Console is shaking side to side... that angle piece is just working like a pry bar and ""stretching"" the rivet until the head gives out. When do you want to drive it up to Penetang??"
778394,icefisherman,2013-04-09 02:28:00,952," Let me see what that is first hahaha seriously....this is why I love all the Irish guys... straight to the point ;-) I think it might be easier if I pay you to come this way Jokes aside...I do need to fix it ASAP as .....well....see you PM's ;-)))  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778395,glen,2013-04-09 02:35:00,2641,Is it below the water line?
778396,irishfield,2013-04-09 02:36:00,26272,I was in the city today Emil... not going back anytime soon. Tired of getting hit from behind down there.. they seem to hate my trucks. Need a new bumper on my F150 after todays at Dundas / Brock.. and 3 sore necks. Not a great thing after LEAVING the Neurosurgeon with Jen...  Penetang... ie Penetanguishene / MIdland... 85 minutes from Bass Pro to put it in perspective for you!  Can't believe the guy you've had fix it twice couldn't put two and two together seeing the boat in person!
778397,icefisherman,2013-04-09 02:39:00,952," Haven't checked while in water but pretty sure it is... I just wanted fixed for good once and forever as I got tired of this particular rivet....so even a case or two of Guinness is small price to pay to get Wayne close to the boat ;-)lol   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778398,icefisherman,2013-04-09 02:43:00,952,"Yeah I read your post about coming to the city today last night but missed by few minutes....hmmmm...how can we do this.....over 2 hrs from home....same distance from me to the place that tried and couldn't fix it permanently twice.... When are you available? Even better question....how about meeting at the spot you just saw in your PM? LOL Still 2 hrs for me but we can use the time better that way if you knwo what I mean ha ha Can we fix it on the parking lot and do immediate real life testing ;-)  Cheers, Emil"
778400,irishfield,2013-04-09 02:50:00,26272,"Would love too Emil.. but have no spare time in the ""happy season"" while I try to get everyone's float planes ready for ice out and ourselves to the lake for Mothers Day.  Air compressor is here...tools are here... rivet stock is here.. aluminum stock is here as it needs to be modified IMHO to stop this from happening again. A few others on here that should know what to do with it that might do a ""drive by"" for you, but if you want me to do it I need the boat in the yard. I'm here all week 'till Sunday. Gone Monday/Tuesday the 15/16th and back late on the 17th."
778405,icefisherman,2013-04-09 03:00:00,952,"Please send me again your number on the PM as I had it but am not sure where it is. Will call you ....no much choice but to try this weekend...maybe Saturday....can't look at the boat when it's like that....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
778452,Loonietoon,2013-04-09 13:23:00,1450,Don't play around.. Wayne has offered to fix it right .. could not refuse this offer... GETTER DONE SON
778454,BillM,2013-04-09 13:24:00,17367," Agreed, well worth the drive..  Op would be silly not to pull that boat up to Penetang and get it fixed correctly."
778590,icefisherman,2013-04-09 21:39:00,952,"Guys,  I know Wayne well for number of years and I am definitely not interested in ""playing around"" as you put it. Trying to organize it with him as his offer is one I cannot pass. Thanks to every one for the comments.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
