779731,BillM,2013-04-15 00:24:00,17367," Any phone that has a GPS enabled when taking pics will usually embed the GPS data in the picture.  A good way of getting around this is uploading the pic to Photobucket first (It strips all EXIF data), then posting it on the site."
779755,Moosebunk,2013-04-15 01:41:00,3970,"Don't own one of them fancy phones so can't contribute.  Will say Nick, looks like you had plenty fun opps this past winter fishing, outdoors and drinking with the wee one. lol.  Thanks for posting... the pics are pretty solid for a phone."
779801,NAW,2013-04-15 10:56:00,4022," Thanks Moose..  It takes a real steady hand, as I'm sure you are well aware.  My wife takes much better shots than I do.  I'm really looking forward to the soft water season.  The local lake opened up last week.  Time to launch the boat, and get this season started!!!  "
771583,NAW,2013-03-04 02:44:00,4022,"I just got my I-phone this year around X-mas this year.  These things are great!  The camera in them is decent.  Way better than my last phone, big time!  It's nice to always have a decent camera with you at all times.  Catch all sorts of cool stuff on video or photo.  I am curious to see what cool shots you guys have on your smart-phones.  Let see some of those winter Ice fishing shots.  There must be some great shots on some OFC'er phones out there!  I'll start with a couple from mine.  Some fishing shots.  But also a bunch of outdoors, and family shots too!  These are all accumulated over the last 3 months.  A bit of a season recap Via Smart phone shots!  The panorama feature on the I-phone is awesome.  If you guys have any good photos on the phones, let see em!   Early ice Orr Lake.  December.   First ice fishing trip with fellow OFC'er Livinisfishin   Same weekend, following day.  Wuabushene.  Sketchy ice!   Later that day on 4"" of black ice!  23"".  Biggest of the year.   The next weekend.  Love the early ice Crappie!!    Working on the ice hut in the garage.. (because the ice was junk on Simcoe!)   Had to lay it on it's side to get out of the garage.  I screwed rollers to the side so I could roll it out.   Once the ice was good on Simcoe we hit her HARD.  But for the first time ever, I'm lined up for a season long white fish skunk...  Lots of these though!   Nippissing with some of the best guys out there!      Teaching my sun a few tricks!!   This weekend he turns 6-months.  So I took him snowshoeing twice, and snapped a bunch of shots.  Here's  a few from the weekend.   This is a little creek crossing on my 5k snowshoe loop.  The roots of this old tree cross the river.  The water flows under the tree.  Great spot to cross.  I laidd some old cedar across in places to make sort of a bridge.   Here's the same creek.  On the left, you can see the water, and if you look close, you can see the trail on the right.  Nice little patch of bush.  I'm am very lucky to have permission of some of the property that I do.  Little peaces of heaven for me and my family to enjoy.   I got to sneak out for a fish saturday AND sunday morning!  Skunked both days..  BRUTAL   Snoeshowing with alex.  My neighbors getting set up for syrup.    Across the road from my house   Alex is tucked way down in there.  He knocks out cold when I snowshoe with him.  We did 5k today, and he didn't make a peep.

771584,Joeytier,2013-03-04 02:48:00,3990,Awesome recap Nick.  Can't believe how well those panoramas turn out.
771593,Nipfisher,2013-03-04 03:03:00,2449,"Great shots. Nick you are a class act, great angler, and family man. I am proud to call you my friend."
771651,Rod Caster,2013-03-04 12:34:00,5784,"There are great odds Alex will grow up to be a sportsman...and a Maclays drinker haha.  Great pics for sure Nick. The iphone camera seems a bit better overall than my BB camera, but regardless, like you said, it's very handy and saves carrying an extra piece of equipment.  I delete my photos as I go, but here are a couple from an early morning laker trip and a couple from Nipissing this Saturday.          "
771662,porkpie,2013-03-04 13:28:00,2521,Nice pics!!  I don't even carry a camera anymore since getting an iPhone!
771672,Rich,2013-03-04 14:53:00,3927,"My android takes better pics than an iphone, but.. i still prefer a real camera. I use it a lot less nowadays though."
771675,NAW,2013-03-04 15:00:00,4022,"Thanks Blair!  Ya, the panorama's are great!  I want to get some printed and see how they look.   That's a great shot Chad!"
771683,Angler management,2013-03-04 15:14:00,280,"Whenever i try to upload my iphone pics, it wont allow me... Says the file is too big."
771691,mr blizzard,2013-03-04 15:37:00,1589,"Great pictures of your outings plus your family, you should be very proud."

771719,Roy,2013-03-04 17:24:00,13728,"Incidentally, our new gallery will accept very large photos. I just uploaded a 3.64 MB pic with no problems."
771733,NAW,2013-03-04 18:46:00,4022,Thanks for the replies today everyone.  But I know there's more fish porn hiding on some phone out there!!!
771757,davey buoy,2013-03-04 21:02:00,5505,"Very nice Nick,I can see my next camera when my current contract is up will be a I phone. The less to bring with you the better."

771925,NAW,2013-03-05 15:06:00,4022,"Some nice shots so far guys!  Ya, I here ya Fishindevel.  The camera in the I-phone sure can use some improvements.  But going from my old flip phone, It's a million times better!  I still can't find a self timer in it though"

779638,Nipfisher,2013-04-14 13:57:00,2449,Good shots. I just recently upgraded to the Iphone 5 and bought the Otter Box Armour series case so I am looking forward to some great action shots and some underwater shots.
779708,NAW,2013-04-14 21:57:00,4022,Those are some good shots Chad!
779724,BillM,2013-04-14 23:59:00,17367,"Just make sure the EXIF data doesn't contain GPS co-ordinates, or you'll be pointing everyone right to your fav fishing holes.."
779726,Rod Caster,2013-04-15 00:05:00,5784,Is that for all phones...or just certain makes?
