779899,Raycaster,2013-04-15 17:49:00,528,"Gotta get this boat and trailer ready soon!  Looking for affordable outdoor carpet to cover some 2X6X16's. Went to Home Depot today but didn't see the usual ""green astroturf""... I see some outdoor carpet but not sure if suitable.  Also, redoing boat furniture and have purchased vinyl and foam and built the furniture but seamstress says I'm missing ""outdoor bunting""? It goes between the foam and the wood...  Hoping to avoid online stuff and would like to pick up in the area.  Suggestions are more than welcome!"

779921,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-15 19:23:00,8243,"I searched Hamilton and area for carpeting to cover my trailer bunks a few years back, I found the best and least expensive materials at the carpet store, sorry no recall right now, between Mt. Hope and Caledonia on Hwy 6 next door to Applegate and James furniture store. Very tight durable waterproof, 3rd year like brand new. About $50.00 maybe, for my 19' boat trailer complete."

780017,Uncle Buck,2013-04-16 00:22:00,1000,I bought grey out door carpeting at home depot its held up good for 4 years so far...  Make sure you don't buy the one that has the rubber backing... You want the one that has no backing And make sure you use stainless steel staples
