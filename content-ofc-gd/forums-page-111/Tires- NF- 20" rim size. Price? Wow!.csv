985026,Dara,2016-11-01 20:10:00,3052,"If the tires are still good enough to turn in then maybe buy a set of 18"" winter rims and put what you want on them, winter, all season, whatever. Drive them till the lease is done, turn it in with the worn but still legal tires and make sure the next lease will take the winter rims and tires you bought  PS Read your lease carefully..I was about to go over KM on my leaser and wanted to know how much it was going to cost me...the spot where its supposed to say 5 or 10 cents per km says N/A.......booonus...somebody messed up when typing it"

I bought the same ones I had for my Avenger when I had it. Salius directional snow tires. I reallyu liked them on the Avenger. So really if I bought from a name store, im up to $900+. No disrespect to John here, what is the mark up on these things? Im getting them for $150 each, instead of $225. And yes, they are  matched tires 2016."

When you purchase said vehicle, I highly doubt you got the best tires available at that time, but rather the most economical tires they could fit on said vehicle."
985190,Dara,2016-11-04 12:36:00,3052,Yup. I know mine had the worst tires ever made on it when I got it
985192,Bill Shearer,2016-11-04 12:52:00,456,Ford put Pirellis on my Edge. Far from good imo BUT Ford wants $300/tire for them. I had a nice smooth quiet ride home on the Yokohamas. And it didn't break the bank.

In the 30 plus years that  I've been running my shop; I don't think I've ever sold a tire at manufacturers suggested list price. I've quoted it a few times, when I didn't want to sell tires to certain people. Anyone who deals in sales & service know the people I'm talking about.

That price you got isn't crazy either. Look for rebate deals too.  I buying tires is part of my job, albeit for truck tires but the ideas are the same. I can try and see what I can get you prices for. PM me with size and details."
