984655,BlueEye,2016-10-27 13:11:00,338,"Got out a couple weeks ago with my daughter in much warmer weather than today up north on the St. Lawrence. I'm an avid musky angler and member of Muskies Canada, Ganaoque Chapter.  It was pretty cool getting to fish with both my dad and my daughter on the same trip.  Ended up boating a couple nice muskies but my 3-year old daughter stole the show when she landed her first ever musky!  I hooked the fish, adjusted drag slightly and handed the rod over to Charlotte.  She laid rod flat on gun rail of boat and cranked her trophy in.  She got to catch the first skiâ€™ of her life and was soooooo happy!  Proud daddy moment there  If you look close in the picture, you can see 1.) the diaper I changed on my other daughter 2 casts before catching that musky  and 2.)  A lamprey that was on the fish.  This was the first ever lamprey I've seen on a musky before.  A quick picture and Charlotte helped me release the fish.  The fish kicked hard away and splashed us both.  My daughter now calls all fish larger than a sunfish a ""Muskie"".  We will work more on species identification once she turns 4 years old  "
