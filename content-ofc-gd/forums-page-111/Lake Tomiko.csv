984571,Chrispy,2016-10-26 15:22:00,168,Hey everyone....I am thinking about booking a cottage in mid June on Lake Tomiko....I am looking for some info on the lake and the walleye and perch fishing for that time of year....thinking of staying at MoosePoint Lodge for the week and renting the pontoon boat for the 4 of us going....any info is welcome!!  Thanks in advance!!   Chrispy!

984587,Chrispy,2016-10-26 17:52:00,168,"Yes, thanks Irishfield....I did just that and read everything....there were a couple people that fish the lake a lot from the looks of some of the other threads and was hoping they could shed some light on the lake....thanks again for the help!!   Chrispy!"
984653,Muskieman,2016-10-27 12:59:00,2472,"Walleye fishing on Tomiko is VERY good in June , especially in the evening , as for Perch , don't count on any big size or numbers , you'll get a whole lot of Rock Bass and Smallies , when you catch a Pike it's usually a decent 5lb or more specimen . Jig / worm / Dace / leech is all you need , although trolling a deep diving crankbait is also quite productive , just stay out of the Tomiko River as it's a sanctuary until July 15th.  Randy ."
