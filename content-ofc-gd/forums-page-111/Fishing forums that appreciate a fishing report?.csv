984790,Big Cliff,2016-10-28 22:39:00,6899,"Just for the heck of it I once posted the GPS co-ordinates to a favorite fishing hole, it was a spot right out in front of our place and I could see it from the window.  Never did see one boat out there, funny thing was, it was a REALLY good walleye hole!  That said however post that you caught some nice walleye or crappie and anyone that knows you probably knows pretty close to where you were fishing (at least in my case because I didn't have a trailer for my boat and a lot of people know me).  Different strokes for different folks, I guess. Post about pan fish, smelts, perch, creak or river fishing, things like that and you have to be really careful. Post about smaller numbers but bigger fish, you get a whole different caliper of people interested.  No one brush paints everything."

Heres a quick story about Karma  3 years ago were in our honey hole during the fall pickerel extravaganza in PAB...sure enough we start hauling fish in, one after another while the boats around us are getting skunked. After an hour of us hauling in some 20+ fish a couple of dinks in a tinner pull their boat within 20 feet of ours  inside against the shore. so we are 25 feet off of the shore and they are now inside of us. Im not one to get rattled about this kinda crap, it is what it is especially during the pickerel run...but the karma that happened next left a big grin on my face.  The dinks continue the skunk and decide to re-adjust their position. While trying to re-adjust their anchor so that they wouldnt swing into our boat (because they nearly did) buddy knocks his entire combo to the bottom of the lake. I jokingly offer to snag it for him and he replies ""whatever it wasnt an expensive set up anyways"" just as he gets his new rod tied up, i hook in and land a PB eye, I pose for a photo and the dinks look at me and have nothing to say but ""nice fish"" I reply ""back she goes to spawn"""

984705,misfish,2016-10-27 20:54:00,29133,"I can remember one post very clearly that I did a few years ago. Fishing a hole thats known by those that are willing to walk to it, I caught a real nice fresh hen salmon. A video was taken and pics posted here. No sooner I posted it, I was told that the lot will be full the next day. There was about 7-9 cars there the next morning. Most like I, were getting suited up. A couple of guys walk by and start talking about the fish I had got. Ya the one I had posted the day before. Never knew them .  Like I said, the spot was known, but it just goes to show that the WWW does bring out the lurkers and gives to many updates.  I post fish outings. I never give exact locations. Back ground gave this spot away. I will still post pics and reports when I want, BUT, they will be cropped. Those that dont like, thats fine with me. No one is forcing you to look or reply.  The one thing I love about ice fishing. The only back ground is the ice or the black back of the hub. When it comes to ice fishing ( for sure on Simcoe) and you dont want guests, you keep the back grounds out.  I,ll bet there are 100,s of guys that will totally agree with this. If you dont think so, go out perch fishing. Start hauling out in the open. See how many new friends you have real quick.  Dont think I dont like to share spots, cuz I do.  I get pm,s from members here that know areas I fish or areas I can help them out with.  I do this like I said,pm. I only do, with those that I trust. That was not meant to be a rude comment. Just the way it is. I have gotten back the same from them on thier spots. Never, have I had to ream anyone of them out, for sharing the info.  No disrespect to others views on the thread, just saying,lesson was learned,and this is the way I deal with it.  So, how about that snow today? It,s got steelhead fishing,written all over it.  Go fish all, get up off yer butts. Well, those that can get up and go.LOL"
984706,SirCranksalot,2016-10-27 21:11:00,3291,"I'm sure this topic has been discussed here before, but IMO post a pic with the background showing is a completely different matter from describing in detail where you caught the fish. If someone recognizes the background they already know that spot. It's probably already one of their faves.It's not going to be any more crowded the next day or the next week from folks lurking on a forum.  IMO, we overestimate the influence of forums such as these. Case in point---I live right next to a popular spot for salmon and bows. Rarely, if ever, will somebody identify this spot as where they caught fish.  The number of people fishing there varies a lot, depending on how good the fishing is(or has been?). These days with texting, e-mail etc the 'grapevine' is hyperactive. People can text there buddies an soon the word spreads."

Many of the trip reports for resorts and fly jns have helped us immensely  But i am guilty of reading and in most cases not saying anything and I am probably showing as a guest 60% of the time Cheers Gordy

I've since used them a lot and vouch for them 100%, amazing product. It's actually 4-5 loops you need to make in the line which is really easy. Just as easy as securing a regular clip really. Once you get them dialed in (takes a couple trips), you never miss a fish. I had a 0.5lb dink trigger the release once."

984497,grimsbylander,2016-10-25 17:06:00,3016,"To clarify  Some people took things out of context...(bound to happen when there is a lack of tone) by my statement, I am calling out every able body on this forum to get out fishing...  I have had conversations with some of the legends around here who are physically incapable of fishing due to age/disability. Hence they 100% get a pass from me because I can tell by the conversations I have had with them, the fact that they cant get out and fish is excruciating to them. I couldnt imagine...  All I have to do is look at my main fishing partner, my very own father...There is no way in hell that he is physically capable of going out in a four foot chop to toss musky baits. Hence, I would never call him out for not fishing.  Irish - my boat is in Pointe Au Baril...ive seen the 12 footers  Brian - as per my most recent report http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=82786&hl=%2Byear+%2Breview  I cant post every time I go fishing or id be posting multiple times per week. I also dont want to bore everyone with 100 photos of 3lb smallies. I try to post photos of PB's, master anglers, first time catches or any musky over 40. However I have a 9 day trip commencing Friday and the intention was to post a report summarizing from the end of July to the middle of November upon my return so stay tuned.  so to summarize, if you are able bodied, get fishing...and send us some pictures.  Just a couple points to contemplate and then I'm done with this thread.  Maybe... It's not your place to call anyone out to fish It's not your place to give passes to those that you deem as too old That posting reports is a personal decision Status or success is not measured by posting reports Many of the ""oldtimers"" on here have forgotten more than many of us know  People use this site for many reasons...some it's just a spot to drop in and get caught up with the banter or see how the fishings has been lately. For others, it's a way of advertising their position as fisherman for personal or business reasons. Whatever. Either way, do what you like but what everyone else does is none of your concern."
984514,porkpie,2016-10-25 19:30:00,2521,"This is the south. And by that I mean anything below Sudbury or North bay.  I stopped putting reports online about a dozen years ago, I've seen spots burn hard as a result of the Internet. The only place I'll put a ""report"" is on my private Facebook page, and even then only if it's a really good day, or if I'm out with my kids or if I'm fishing with a partner and we do well.  My longtime fishing buddies are all very experienced fisherman and have no desire to see me posing selfies of 5 pound steelhead or 2 pound pickerel on Facebook, or fish laying in the dirt (no that was not a shot at you, just a fact about my fishing buddies).  The only people who will see what I occasionally put on Facebook  are folks I know personally and that includes a couple folks on this board.  Anyone else I could give a damn, I don't need to measure the length of my Johnson online.  Post away as it suits you but most of us living south of the IQ line long ago gave up putting stuff out there.  The last time I mentioned anything about the lake our family cottage was on I got a few PMs looking for spots.  I'm not about to cut out backgrounds to take photos and if I posted them online as is, I'd have new best friends all summer."

Not lake our lakes are pounded on masse  Id be pissed if my reports led to people flooding to my cabin as well  Here all the anglers know the real good lakes, and all those lakes have numerous hotspots so it rarely gets crowded(exception being sawbill)  The small lakes are hit or miss. But thats part of the fun! And when I find a good one I dont mind sharing because most around here arent willing to haul a motor through the bush 2km lol"

I take the time to post intimate pics of myself and my family, fishing, camping, nature, and nobody gives a crap  I love others reports and always chime in. It takes time and im very appreciative members take their time to show us their adventures.  Ofc should put a week hiatus on any post not fishing or huntin related and see how the response is I'd bet the average age of a member has increased dramatically over the last ten years and people have less time in their lives. I did look at your first thread but not the other two. Nice fish by the way.  The lack of responses? That is always hit and miss.

However you can still easily post reports without naming specific spots or lakes! I appreciate all the reports I've read over the years here, it helps fuel the love for fishing when not on the water. I actually read this whole thread and should of spent my time reading something fishing related... but I guess these have to happen sometimes to clear the air.

I got spooled by a sturgeon last night and had mono laying around so I spooled it up for today.  Big mistake! Shoulda made the hour drive to get some nanofil or PP"
984395,Joeytier,2016-10-24 19:21:00,3990,"Having been around this place for a bit, I'll add my 2 cents. If you are expecting folks to chime in on your report, regardless of what it contains, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. No one here owes you anything. No one has forced anyone to submit a post and no one should expect anything back, that's the way of message boards. If you need social reassurance for your social networking presence, go to face book. That's what it's for. I am not saying don't post here or don't do a report, but complaining about not getting warm and fuzzies back from the community for your efforts in posting seems a little juvenile. You put it up on your own free will and people will either read it and comment or they won't. Expect nothing and at worst, that's what you will get.  HH I don't think anybody is looking for social reassurance.  Do you enjoy reading fishing reports that were written with thought and care?  I do, and I remember when this board was full of them and the conversations were plentiful.  I do believe that a lot of the more diehard anglers that posted a lot of fishing content have long since left, due to the endless nasty bickering in the political and other NF threads, and how the fishing content is secondary to everything else.  A few years ago if you were to come on here a day or two after a long weekend the front page would be brimming with awesome stories and photos from everyones adventures, nowadays you're lucky to see one, more than likely none.  I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that fact."
984396,manitoubass2,2016-10-24 19:24:00,11391," When I first joined it was rediculous how many reports there were on a daily basis. It was awesome to read all the journies and enjoy the pics. Then one year winternet was mentioned and its like it never left  Im just gonna take it personally, and since I fish alot, ill keep flooding the site with reports?"

I get your excitment, but a little respect, goes along way.  Your 100% pass comment, was not RESPECT.  My report this weekend, was of  a great man that once graced this board. I dont post for recognition. Also my spelling and grammer sucks  for those that wish to read, HIGH quality written reports Other then that, I will be very selective on my future posts here.  It,s the way it is.  No disrespect to OP here."

Seems like a misunderstanding to me as well. I don't see the disrespect in giving the old-timers a pass on having to go fishing and posting reports?  Is it disrespectful to help an old lady cross the street?
984411,misfish,2016-10-24 21:26:00,29133," Seems like a misunderstanding to me as well. I don't see the disrespect in giving the old-timers a pass on having to go fishing and posting reports?

LOL  BTW, Did we miss this fishing report?"
984413,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-24 21:28:00,8243,"I'll take the pass. I would give almost anything to be able to fish as much as I did just 10 years ago. Getting in and out of a boat has become a challenge let alone fishing a majestic stream on a beautiful Fall day like today. 1 day on the water means 3 days of icing body parts, and that's from the nice comfortable big boat. It's sucks."

I get why people took his comments the wrong way but I doubt they came out the way he intended them to.  I was out last week on Gaby trolling for steel.  Had a great day, no report, just didn't feel like sharing.   Will probably be back out in the next week before they're up the rivers."

I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that fact. Like I said, I have been here a long time. I have seen the board being full of reports and I to, took part in the fun. As this board has become the go to site for people looking for free information, mostly ""guests"", many have stopped putting up reports. Giving away free information to those unwilling to put the work in to develop their own hows and whys, has scared many off posting reports in areas that are within easy driving of populated areas. We have some members who little to no worries about this, as they live in out of the way places and have virtually no fishing pressure, in comparison to those who live in the more populated areas. Add to the fact that many of us, who have been here a long time, have been there and done that. Rolling around in four footers was something some of us were doing, when others were still in public school. I have already worn out the tee shirt and sweatpants I got for doing that for years. Back to the point of the OP... this board is a community, who's binding force is fishing. A long time ago, it was decided that in order to keep the board alive and viable, and given the propensity of board members to utilize the depth of knowledge and experience of it's members, we would evolve into a community and have discussions, like a community. Many of us have kids, jobs, you name it, that take from us the one thing we can't buy or manufacture, time. When I first joined here, well before the invention of dirt, I had virtually zero obligations to my time. Well, time has changed that and I am lucky, for now, to be able to get out when I can. As far as I can tell, that doesn't diminish my membership here, nor should it put me or any other member, in a position to be scolded by the community or just some members who are in different places in their life. MB2, I was not calling you out for whining, not my intention. My intention was to point out that you may have expectations that simply can't be met in a public forum such as this. That's what facebook is for. HH"
984487,AKRISONER,2016-10-25 15:23:00,5558,"To clarify  Some people took things out of context...(bound to happen when there is a lack of tone) by my statement, I am calling out every able body on this forum to get out fishing...  I have had conversations with some of the legends around here who are physically incapable of fishing due to age/disability. Hence they 100% get a pass from me because I can tell by the conversations I have had with them, the fact that they cant get out and fish is excruciating to them. I couldnt imagine...  All I have to do is look at my main fishing partner, my very own father...There is no way in hell that he is physically capable of going out in a four foot chop to toss musky baits. Hence, I would never call him out for not fishing.  Irish - my boat is in Pointe Au Baril...ive seen the 12 footers  Brian - as per my most recent report http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=82786&hl=%2Byear+%2Breview  I cant post every time I go fishing or id be posting multiple times per week. I also dont want to bore everyone with 100 photos of 3lb smallies. I try to post photos of PB's, master anglers, first time catches or any musky over 40. However I have a 9 day trip commencing Friday and the intention was to post a report summarizing from the end of July to the middle of November upon my return so stay tuned.  so to summarize, if you are able bodied, get fishing...and send us some pictures."
984274,bigugli,2016-10-23 21:48:00,6138,"I read just about all of the fishing reports for a week in one evening, and stay away from a lot of the crap. Just have been sooo busy with farm, grand kids, deaths, etc..  I love all your fishing reports, and appreciate the time you put into them even if I get just a touch jealous these days. As far as my own fishing, I'm lucky to get a couple of hours out with the kids and grandkids, but that all changes in a few more weeks."

Guys need advice on new truck tires, repair an outboard problem, how to install new brakes, installing a new roof ... the list is endless.  I have learned a lot from these type of reports.  I have never posted pix cuz I don't know the procedure.  But that's my own fault.  Also, in order to post pix of fish - I'd have to catch one first!  LOL!"

It doesn't mean I don't enjoy reading them I just don't have anything constructive to add.  I don't care what the water temperature was or how deep the fish were, as in your case I'll probably never be fishing where you were and if I did I'd probably want to be fishing with you anyway.  I don't post much in the way of fishing reports or fishing related pictures, I got slammed way too many times for trying to be helpful and giving away too much information: ""people know where you live, hey, that's where we fish now everyone is going to fish there, stop telling everyone what to use........"". It is easier just to say nothing!  I like to try to help others whenever I can so I do post things that I think might be helpful to others. Over the years given away (or sold for next to nothing) a lot of stuff; ice huts, fishing gear, furniture...... anything I have that I think might help someone else and that I don't need anymore.

Wind NE 15k gusting to 25k. Fishing was pretty darned good!!! My buddy and I boated 14 lakers and 2 pike in just over 4 hours of fishing. Nothing of any size though. 8 or 10# was the largest. Most were 4-6#'s Heading back out in the AM. Launch bay will be frozen by next weekend so I'm done until safe ice.         Happy now??

984193,Moosebunk,2016-10-23 04:48:00,3970,"It's a miserable weekend Rick and people likely feel the same. lol  This is a favorite site of mine to check in on and probably always will be. There's a quality bunch here that participates or at the very least is regularly present. From Facebook too, for friends and family outside of fishing for years I have linked people to here and now some have even signed on. I'll always be around too. But the participation levels on basically all the forums I know have dwindled over the years.  The quick ""like"" elsewhere is easier than offering the efforts needed here, especially with reporting.  And it's that same constant quick feed elsewhere that I fear has depreciated efforts in making big, or quality, or even regular reports online.  Brian is about the only member here who puts in the constant effort like that which many people seemed to once do.  On a personal note, having to format/edit the same text to suit different sites (as I have always belonged to several public and private sites) has long become annoying. Some reports have taken up to 45 minutes to post and repost on just three sites as the copy and paste just doesn't fully cut it.  All this comes after the initial labor of love in writing the thing.  I can imagine there have been some others who find this tedious as well. For me, it is about to get worse too, unless I change things.  Have found overall that many here are accepting, supportive and decent.  A decade of my drivel and some of the same still show kindness and thanks every time. The place sorely misses the presence and posts of much of it's moderators and long time members though.  The occasional name calling comes my way too and surely there's guys who roll their eyes each time I post, but for the most part this board has always administered a healthy dose of brotherly angler love from whomever is aboard the ship.  Don't let the hits and posts beatchya down though Rickman!  Although you put in the solid effort to entertain, are proud of your catches or maybe need a ""pick me up"" post to lick your sickness today, sometimes folks just ain't willing to join the game or they aren't even around.  For the record, I liked your pics dood!"
984194,wormdunker,2016-10-23 08:57:00,1711,I loved reading your recent posts Rick & as I stated before your pix are awesome!  Other boards I visit have been short on fishing reports lately as well.  Maybe because it's in between seasons for these people.  Drifter good to see you got into the lakers.  I do miss your thread of your cabin build.  I was in Kashechewan for 8 weeks & may have missed some recent updates.
984199,buick14,2016-10-23 11:51:00,741,"Manitou:  I have seen just about all of your posts the past while, and all are incredible.  I think the reason is some ppl here are getting tired with every other post not related to anything.  Generally I remember when a post like yours received comments out the wazzzooo , thus making some of us alternate comments on threads.  But now, seems like many have taken that approach, and comments aren't coming. Some people have or are in transition of moving on to different online communities also....  I enjoy your posts and everybody else's for that matter fishing related.  It takes a lot of time , and you're proud to share your findings.  But now it's like sharing money with an affluenza teen.  I have noticed fishing everything seems to be slower , including selling.  Like a complete ghost town.  I felt the market has died , wonder if it's the same for everything else, flu shot or... * thoughts of conspiracy*.  Regardless of if people actually respond, the amount of views posters receive should make them feel some sort of comfort (I do all my OFC on iPhone so it doesn't show me views tho, so I'm assuming that function still exists).  Anyhow manitou, you are not alone and many people have felt what you feel. Great posts bud!"
984200,Terry,2016-10-23 11:55:00,14456,people dont seem to comment on fishing threads any more so the only way to gauge success  is to  count the views and be happy with the fact that 145 people looked at your report
984204,alexmedic,2016-10-23 12:43:00,186,"if all you haver to worry about is people replying to your posts after you have had the opportunity to fish all day, consider yourself a lucky man!!!"
984205,Moosebunk,2016-10-23 13:47:00,3970,"It's a back and forth participation between members that keeps forums alive.  If that stops it all does.  And Rick is OK to ask the question, ""are there fishing forums that appreciate fishing reports?""  Because yes, here especially, this site can get pages and pages of people coming out in droves to post on so many non-fishing related topics, but some of those same people will view someone's report and never offer anything.  In seconds their fishing is on page two because generic home renos and the Blue Jays inspired anglers more.  Those kinds of things only serve to crush the ""fishing"" on a fishing forum.  And I do believe it's time that the forums separate into fishing and non-fishing, or that the one page be split in half somehow with fishing topics and reports at the top and the rest at the bottom.  Just the coffee, toast and marmie talk this morning.. Maybe muskie this afternoon.  Gonna drop a huge report here this week."

984212,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 14:43:00,11391,"Thanks for the replies doods!  Lotsa good ideas but I too back a NON fishing Subform  Doesnt need to be complicated, just two forums, fishing/hunting and a second Non fishing related  When I ran a forum its simple to do as well. Takes 5 minutes  The problem would be organzing older threads.  Anyhow its cold a rainy out, me thinks the big walleyes might turn on today so im off soon to check it out!"
984213,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-23 14:52:00,8243,I still love you.
984219,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 15:30:00,11391,Does that mean youll lift the prenup? ???  Love ya too brotha!
984220,Jds63,2016-10-23 15:46:00,1365,"Rick , Bunk, Dave, Brian, Chris B and others Thanks for all the reports !!! ... , my fishing stories have sucked for the last 2 years , other than some great crappie fishing last spring."
984221,Sterling,2016-10-23 16:05:00,477,"And I do believe it's time that the forums separate into fishing and non-fishing, or that the one page be split in half somehow with fishing topics and reports at the top and the rest at the bottom.

So you can't post a thread unless you've selected ""non-fishing"" or ""fishing"". Something like that.  Then add a filter at the top, so that users may sort by fishing or non-fishing.  That's what I do on my forums anyway."
984225,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-23 16:24:00,8243,"If I ever catch another fish I'll be sure to make a report. I didn't have much to report this year, I'm not alone either I think.  It gets difficult to come up with pronouns and adverbs other than the standards everyone posts on fishing reports so guys don't because it gets repetitive. Thus the like features. That election thread I started had well over 2000 hits when a great fishing thread started the same day earlier had 500 hits. A separate forum for all non fish related threads might be an idea, many have them. Social media has evolved since this site was created. I am a member of a NFL teams site and there is a forum there dedicated to anything else. A popular ""anything else"" thread is fishing, go figure."
984228,mj2112,2016-10-23 16:42:00,46,I am guilty of not posting threads or comments but I do try to read everyone's posts. I just read and learn and have little to offer lol.
984231,misfish,2016-10-23 16:59:00,29133,Oh quit your gryping. LMAO  I looked and ya didnt post. Lots of pics of fish and kids. Lots of fun had.  I post reports to support and just to share. I know that many are looking for the wheres. Hench the cropping now in all my pics.  Just ask BillM. Lesson learned. LOL  Short report coming soon. Had a smiling angel over me today Im sure.  Thanks Bunk
984238,Steelheadphycho,2016-10-23 17:31:00,470,"I too am guilty of seeing and not responding. I apologize for this. It's been a long two years. Full of changes,good and bad. My biggest problem is time. I don't have as much as I used to. It seems the second I sit down to enjoy these forums I hear a ""daddy, can you....?"" Or ""honey,can you....?""  I've started a new career that I never expected I would. You do the same thing for 23 years and you don't expect it to ever change.  But, believe it or not, my brothers and I got out today to chase the reason I'm the ""psycho"". Rose at 4:30am to make the 2 hour drive north to Arcola creek.  Didn't catch a thing  Oh well, as said many times. A bad day fishing is better then a good day at work.  I'll post pics when I get a minute. LOL!!!  P. S. Rick, Dave, Drew and EVERYONE for that matter, please don't change a thing. Your contributions to these forum are what make it what it is. I can't imagine them any other way.  Thanks everyone"
984242,Whitespinnerbait,2016-10-23 17:55:00,2038,"Wicked report and  pics to say the least...Unfortunately, Fishing Reports seem to be of little interest for whatever reason."
984249,ecmilley,2016-10-23 18:27:00,2163,"yup very little action on fishing reports here these days so I don't bother, no one needs to see what where I am catchin anyway"
984273,Joeytier,2016-10-23 21:43:00,3990,"I have been thinking the same thing Rick.  The whole point for me of posting a report was more than just sharing success with fellow outdoorsman, but sparking lots of conversations and sharing information.  I tried sharing a yr-end report full of wild brook trout pics and it was done after a day or two, but a thread about car tires will be hot for months.  I understand that it's a community of friends first and foremost, but at what point should you just stop calling it a fishing forum.  I think Chris Brock nailed it.  I'll check back when I need advice on a new BBQ I guess lol"
