984803,Shloim,2016-10-29 13:20:00,515,"So, I bought a top from Empire tops for my 16' side console. After getting scorched a couple of times and soaked a couple of others, I decided to give it a try on the advice of a buddy, who loves his. (plus the top was 50% off with free shipping) Now my only reservation is putting holes in my gunnels for it. The boat is in mint condition except for a few leaky rivets that are a work in progress.... I was thinking of mounting a gear track instead of screwing it in directly. This way I can also use the track for other things if necessary because I'm not convinced I can stomach  drilling screws into it for  the top of ""uncertainty"". Any advice on which track to use? or where to get it! or another trick for mounting this top without the holes?. Was thinking of getting some stainless nuts welded to some stainless bands/strips I have and attaching them to the gunnels with some small holes not on the top that I can stomach better. I mentioned a top once before here, and got massively mixed reviews, so now I still dont know, as I trust the advice of you folks immensely!  Thanks in advance folks! Sheldon"
984812,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-29 16:37:00,10439,I put a bimini on my boat a couple of years ago and ended up using this track (http://www.cabelas.com/product/boating/boat-covers/bimini-tops%7C/pc/104794380/c/104703480/sc/104216580/bimini-top-hardware-slide-track/751575.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fbimini-tops%2F_%2FN-1100622%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_104216580) so I could move it all the way back when not in use. A few small holes are nothing to worry about. I didn't even bother to seal them on my boat. No issues.

984833,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-29 23:59:00,10439,"I've got the same on my boat and it works great, had to drill 6 holes (3/side) in a brand new boat. I feel your pain at drilling into a new boat, it was hard, but the benefits of shade/ dryness kept me on the water longer during the summer. Remember, measure 17 times, drill once!  Don't forget the 8 other holes for anchors the tension lines clip on to."
