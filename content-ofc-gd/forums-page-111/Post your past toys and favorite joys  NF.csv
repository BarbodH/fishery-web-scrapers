Going  to replace the axle on the ice hut and move the wheels out from under. Then make up a drop suspension, so that I can lay the frame right down on the ice. Something like this trailer.    I made the door on the hut large enough, so that I can drive the snowmobile in. It works pretty good, I have the comfort of a permanent hut; that I can travel to different lakes with.    Dan"

985115,ckewley,2016-11-03 11:50:00,699,"Took me awhile to track down some photo's, I do have some recent ones somewhere & will pop them up when found but in the meantime,  My 1968 BSA Victor Clubman 441cc single, bought it as a basket case when I was 14. After tracking down a lot of missing parts I put together a rolling basket (pictured) it would be a few more years of tracking down parts & ditching Lucas crap. Currently it's a cafe racer   The BSA will always be my first love but when I was 20 I bought another basket case this time it was a 1970 Norton 750 Commando S model. It has seen it's fair share of transformations over the years. A lot of missing parts but parts are more common for these than the BSA so it took half the time to put her together. Started stock then morphed to a chopper, had a sweet goose neck frame given to me, plunger rear. Never really been a chopper fan, more a bobber guy myself so thats the state she's in to this day. I'm seperated from them by about 2500km as they're in Nova Scotia but one day they shall be back here.   Over the years there have been others, Triumphs, Yamaha's, Honda's, Vespa with a side car (really cool thing) but all never stayed with me."

Yamaha SVB, re-issue of a bass originally released in the late 60's.  Moon Jazz bass, made in Japan by the best luthiers they have to offer. Picked up on CL for a steal!  Marshall VBA400 and Bergantino 6x10 cabinet. All picked up on CL for pennies on the dollar. This rig will eliminate constipation quicker than Metamucil.  Rickenbacker 4003 - now gone! Beautiful instrument, just not for me! Just like a reel or rod is either what you want or not, this one just wasn't for me. The guy that bought it from me, well he's a happy dude!  This pic was taken at an outdoor gig and few years ago. I know, nice shirt eh!!! Roscoe LG3000, boutique American made. I will be buried with this guitar!!!!  Yamaha BB1100S - Main bass when I toured in the 80's. Sentimental value here!  Pedulla Rapture - found this at a pawn shop. They wanted a ton for the bass, so I waited them out. After a year of hanging in the shop, with not takers, I picked it up for less than half of what they were asking for, after they ""got sick of looking at it""!

Only cars of vintage I ever got rid of was the '76 Volare that I bought of Leah's father for $300 bucks in 1985 or so. Still have the '77 Ramcharger I bought right after Leah and I where married in '82, although it is about 6"" lower now. Still have my '69 Bee that I bought from my father in 1979 (he bought it new) and the only real new addition to MY car toys I bought in 1989 while on a business trip to McAllen Texas, my '70 Superbird that I couldn't pay for and load for transport fast enough and sent it home. In 1992 I bought Leah a piece of plastic for our 10th Anniversary that she is currently telling me to sell.  Pictures of the ramcharger, the 'Bee and the 'Bird with the 'Bee and Vette in the shop last fall.  As many know the Bee is in pieces, some of it shown above that had Sterling questioning value. Problem with restoring old cars these days is that a single part can cost more than the original MRSP of the car. My father bought the 'Bee new for about $2800 + tax. I have more than that in new dash panels, pads, bezels and a repro tic tock tach.  Parts on the floor Sterling. Two A833 4 speeds that now sell used at about $2500 each, a big block K frame minimum $500, Lakewood Scatter shield again min $500 used. Drive shafts are like unobtainium and two posi trac pumkins sitting there at about $1500 each and my rear end housing again at least $500."

Can't beat the mustangs. I guess it was ten years ago! I used to fish Quinte from October, until the ice wouldn't let us on the water. Here's a pic of what we found one morning after the 2 hour drive from the GTA.  Took us two hours to clear the launch of enough ice to launch. Honestly, having started fishing Quinte so long ago, well before the zebra mussels cleared the water and the number of boats out could be counted on one hand, I caught a lot of Pickereyes. The one in the pic is just another of many that were caught. Back in the good ole days, 20-30 fish per day for two guys was pretty normal. We got to the point where we wouldn't even take a pic of a fish, unless it was a teen. I got my PB there, it was 14.75lbs. This was well before the advent of digital cameras. So, the story of this fish isn't positive, but if memory serves me well, it was caught in a snow storm, just east of the Glenora ferry on our way out for the day. Probably in the 10lb range. The dude in the background is my long time friend and former PWT (professional Walleye Tour)tour pro. I learned a ton from him! HH"
