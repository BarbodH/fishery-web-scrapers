985040,Freshtrax,2016-11-02 00:38:00,2215,"I got a PM a few weeks ago stating that Ckewley had a line on the legendary lake that the MNR accidentally stocked with Auroras, and since they were stocked into a Brookie lake they were technically Brookies he asked if I was down  and I instantly cleared my schedule for a few days.  Last Thursday a motley crew of hardcore OFC  Brookie fishermen met up at the hwy 89 carpool well before sun up and headed North for a few nights.  We did not take a whole lot of pictures but ended up with about 20 Brookies , 10 auroras , and 2 rainbows between us. Not bad considering the lakes were mid turnover.   The Brookies were nice and colorful, the Bonfires were massive, the fish-tales even bigger,  and the beers were plenty.  Thanks Guys for a great few days.   And to you know who your are that gave us the tip ....we are forever in debt.                     till our  next adventure......."
