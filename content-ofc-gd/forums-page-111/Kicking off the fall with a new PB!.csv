Now that the fish are starting to move into the rivers I'm back fishing hard and filming it. We went out last week and the morning started from really slow. Casted as the sun came up with no luck. After a couple hours we decided to start jigging. Again slow. Finally on the last drift of the day my bait got SMOKED by my new personal best musky. A solid 49"" x 19"". Just short of 50"" but that will keep me hungry for the rest of the fall! Check out the video below!  "
984612,Gallie,2016-10-26 22:10:00,1215,Nice ski dude!
984613,mike rousseau,2016-10-26 22:18:00,4661,Again the jig!!!  I bought a second bondy... now I have a black one and a white one  I'm planning to try jogging a bit when it's cold and I don't wanna cast

I bought a second bondy... now I have a black one and a white one  I'm planning to try jogging a bit when it's cold and I don't wanna cast   Honestly I prefer casting, jigging hurts my arm and shoulder after a while...however you are right, on those crazy cold days when casting will freeze your hands, jigging is much preferred."
984621,Rich Clemens,2016-10-26 23:17:00,3131,Awesome. Always great to see folks raising the bar on themselves.    Congrats
984625,Rizzo,2016-10-26 23:31:00,4754,"I can troll for hours. I can cast for hours. But jigging? Ten minutes and I'm done. Not sure why, just can't do it"
984626,PUMP KNOWS,2016-10-26 23:44:00,937,Beast!  What rod and reel are you using?
984628,captpierre,2016-10-27 00:26:00,2521,Well done. Nice handling of that girl. When you jig are you marking the fish below the boat?
984630,PBenson,2016-10-27 01:04:00,154,Beast!  What rod and reel are you using?   Reel: Shimano Calcutta 400b Rod: St Croix Mojo Musky Heavy
984631,PBenson,2016-10-27 01:05:00,154,"Well done. Nice handling of that girl. When you jig are you marking the fish below the boat?  Sometimes we do, but mostly we just jig different depths until we contact fish. If we get one we do the same drift again."
984633,BucktownAngler,2016-10-27 02:35:00,582,nice fish
984635,Moosebunk,2016-10-27 02:47:00,3970,"Nice thing with jigging muskies is the later in the fall, the lighter the gear and smaller the jigs you can get away with.  Great fish, congrats on the PB PB."
984646,PBenson,2016-10-27 11:50:00,154,Thanks guys

984738,Pigeontroller,2016-10-28 01:00:00,2793,Great Muskie! Great video! Awesome net!
984742,PBenson,2016-10-28 02:06:00,154,Thanks! Heading out again in the morning. Water temps have dropped 7 degrees in the past week so I'm thinking they should be biting!
984767,mark demmery,2016-10-28 14:38:00,68,How did you make out? bit better with the colder temps?
984778,PBenson,2016-10-28 17:42:00,154,"Yes sir just got in, between three of us we went 6/10."
984899,mark demmery,2016-10-31 14:21:00,68,nice work!  We are trying to make the trip down in the next week or two....
984924,esoxansteel,2016-10-31 20:54:00,1307,"Great vid, looking forward to more, waters cold, muskies starting to chew flies as well, 10 and 12 wts getting a workout, would love to head to LSC best chance at a 50 on the fly, but fall is so unpredictable weather wise, and its a 5 1/2 hour drive for me, went there once in the fall Nov and went for 4 days and only the first day was fishable, the rest we sat at the mouth of the Thames and drank whisky which wasnt bad either, and watched the dudes fishing the mud, which been a steelheader muddy rivers is not a good thing"
