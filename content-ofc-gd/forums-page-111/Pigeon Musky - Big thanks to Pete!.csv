985369,JoshS,2016-11-07 15:47:00,729,Nice work and nice ski's! Wish my wife could hold a musky like that.
985400,cowanjo,2016-11-07 20:41:00,249,Pete delivers again looks like a great day......no trampoline photo what happened
985402,Tjames09,2016-11-07 21:16:00,664,Trampoline had no action. We only hit it once in the morning.
985410,Moosebunk,2016-11-07 23:45:00,3970,"Good on Pete, dood knows his skis!  Well done for you and the Missus, great looking fish."
984912,Tjames09,2016-10-31 18:29:00,664,"Pete from OFC took me and my wife out for a full day of Musky fishing on Pigeon. The weather was cold and wet, but we had a great day and landed some decent fish!  My wife started the day off landing a 39.5"" on a senko (yes senko), on a light spinning rod for bass (she was taking a break from casting the big heavy stuff). I guess they wanted a really slow small presentation in the morning.    We found an amazing spot mid afternoon that was on fire. Landed two good muskies and had 2 more follows to the boat.  First one was 42""    Second one was 40""    I'll keep the lures a secret between me and Pete"
984913,TennesseeGuy,2016-10-31 18:46:00,957,You're a lucky guy.   Keep her happy.  You have yourself a keeper.

985237,Fisherpete,2016-11-05 10:29:00,1814,It was a pleasure taking you two out! Was a cold and windy day for sure but you and D toughed it out and we finally found that spot with a bunch of active fish in the afternoon. I think I have to start carrying a tray of senkos with me in the boat now... that was awesome.  Cheers! Pete
985367,AKRISONER,2016-11-07 15:39:00,5558,"not surprised at all, Pete delivers as always...and as always simply a heck of a guy to fish with.  Congrats on the skis! im sure you have the musky bug just like me now because of Pete. His enthusiasm for the species is contagious"
