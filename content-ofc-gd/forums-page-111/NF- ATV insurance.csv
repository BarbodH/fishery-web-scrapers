983449,atvaholic,2016-10-14 16:25:00,271,Just picked an old Polaris sportsman 06 model to have a little fun.  Had a quad back in the day but sold it. I don't remember what insurance costs but I just got quoted $430.00 for the year on a 10 year old machine.  Wondering what everyone else pays. I don't remember it being so damn expensive.
983456,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-14 17:10:00,8243,Yep. if it has wheels or an engine on it insurance has become ridiculous. Especially off road toys. A buddy was just talking about 700 a year for a brand new snow machine.
983458,porkpie,2016-10-14 17:12:00,2521,"I get a discount through work, but I pay about $350 a year for insurance on my 2005 350cc 4x4 quad and a 1998 500cc snowmobile.  I've been told this is a very good price for both, and I'm not sure how much the work discount factors in.  A lot may have to do with the size of the quad etc."

A buddy was just talking about 700 a year for a brand new snow machine.  Full coverage on my sled back in late '07 was $850!!! Needless to say I dropped the collision on it to save$$$$.

983472,Big Cliff,2016-10-14 20:01:00,6899,"<$40.00 a month, I'd say you are doing ok!"
983481,Woodsman,2016-10-14 22:05:00,1286,I pay $410 per year for full coverage on a 2016 450 Outlander L Max DPS. I'm sure my discount for them having my 2 vehicles & house plays a part in that rate.
983486,Sinker,2016-10-14 22:50:00,8692,"Call around. A lot of places wont even insure them. Canada life, and state farm are supposed to be pretty good for ATV's and Sleds. I have my sled insured with my auto insurance through CAA....costs me about $20 a month for the sled.  S."
983495,Fisherman,2016-10-14 23:31:00,7201,$153 a year PL/PD fire and theft. 2009 Grizzly 550.
983504,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-15 00:32:00,8243,To put things in perspective I just turned 23 and bought a 1977 L-88 Corvette Stingray in 1978. I paid $850.00 a year for insurance. I was only making around $1000.00 a month though. And that was good deal then as I wasn't yet 25 but back then I think the pre 25 year old higher premiums only applied to women drivers.
983516,Woodsman,2016-10-15 03:05:00,1286,Yes insurance #'s differ but you must compare apples to apples. A rate for PL & PD only can not compare to a rate for Pl & PD + fire & theft and comp & collision (including on ice).
983531,wormdunker,2016-10-15 09:39:00,1711,"Fisherman's Grizz at $153.00 per year sounds like a very good price including fire & theft.  In 2012 I had a brand new Polaris Sportsman 500.  My insurance cost was $29.00 per month with TD Canada Trust insurance.  I was covered for PL/PD, fire, theft & collision.  I'm not sure if I was covered while travelling on a frozen lake.  The amount of deductible will also play a big part in your premium."
