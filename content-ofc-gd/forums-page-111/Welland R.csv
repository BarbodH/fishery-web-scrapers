We did have to go through a whole lot of dinks, but we did get ourselves enough perch, gills and crappie for a nice feed. Boy do I love the fall."

Leaves are almost gone, but whats left, are beautiful colours. Silver fish and fall folage.  I,ll bet your feed was awesome, as was the time spent."

My 2 shore fishing trips this fall have both resulted in Skunks   I don't think I've been skunked on 2 consecutive perch trips EVER.  Had  Chicken Thighs from No Frills for supper again tonight
