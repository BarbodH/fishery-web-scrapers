985058,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-02 03:56:00,8243,"It's going to be a while before any ice here on Erie. Buddy went out today and got some hawg size Small mouth here. I was even tempted with 22C weather today.  Jumping pressure cracks in the middle of the lake is half the fun. I love when the hut shook. Nothing like throwing a line down and tossing a football on a nice sunny winters day out on the ice, forget shore lunch it always tasted better in the middle of the lake, everything did. I am looking forward to our 35 year reunion on Nipp this winter. I couldn't talk my cousin from Georgia to join us again. He was scared stiff when he went out on Nippising ice 30 years ago and heard his first pressure crack. He refused to go out day 2 so he stayed at the cottage and cooked us a real southern dinner.  Huzz get yourself a million dollar life insurance plan making the wife beneficiary, she will buy you some new ice fishing tackle."

My ex-bro-inlaw got lost on Simcoe years ago and freaked out so I don't blame those that had a bad day out to never want to go out again BUT I WANT ICE NOW!"
985061,pics,2016-11-02 07:45:00,1268,If I was a betting man I'd say we are in for a year with lots of slush and white ice.. dangerous for sure!!.. early snow and a late freeze.. my annuals are still in flower and my neighbor has vegetables to pick. The trees have their leaves and most are green to boot..
985067,DanD,2016-11-02 11:24:00,2223,"Well guys you can likely blame me for the poor ice conditions. I've finally built the fish hut that I had wanting to do for a few years. Finished it mid winter last year and only had one day of safe ice to try it out; other then traveling twice the distance. You watch I'll hang on to the hut for a few years, get tired of looking at it; not being used and sell it. That's when you'll see weeks on end of -20Â°. LOL  Dan"

985158,Raf,2016-11-03 22:29:00,3495,weather network says great lakes are 3-4 degrees warmer than normal for this time of year.  that can change quickly but not with the 14 day forecast we're seeing.  i predict lots of lake effect snow for those of us in the usual snowsquall areas and a bunch of happy sledders but propably a late ice up

984931,huzzsaba,2016-10-31 21:24:00,884,"So with all the talks about a harsher winter, are we expecting earlier ice fishing season?  I sure hope so because the wife has banned me from ice fishing unless the ice is more than 12 inches thick.  I don't blame her.  Last year, with 10 inches of ice mid february, and ice still forming, we rented a hut on cooks bay.  halfway through the day, we felt the ice shift (like a earthquake).  Not fun IMO  .  Hopefully we have a winter like 2 winters ago.  more than 30 inches of ice!"
984932,Terry,2016-10-31 21:30:00,14456,I'm sure it will be fine  however I'm not putting the boat away till February just in case

Its a sign that the ice is getting thicker and expanding.  I have ice fished simcoe on Dec. 8th before. Lets hope this year is a repeat.  S.

One year we were out on the laker grounds miles out and around lunch a large pressure ridge formed by the shore. When it let go the hut jumped in the air and a fountain of water shot out of the hole!!! The outfitter had to drop us off at the ridge and we had to climb over the 20' wall of ice to get back to our vehicles.

984944,Joeytier,2016-10-31 23:42:00,3990,Early is relative...will it be earlier than last year?  Most definitely.  Tell your wife to do some research on ice safety lol.  No offense but I don't think she's an authority on the matter.

LOL  Outside of the regular crowd that wanders onto Lake Erie here in the winter you really don't see many people ice fishing here. I doubt that even in the bad winters of the later 1970's any of our lakes saw 30 inches of ice.  One of my cousins went thru the ice when I was young and died, and a couple of my buddies that ice fished have fallen thru, but lived. Not something I ever had enough interest in to try, I worked in the ice, cold, and snow, winter was reel cleaning time!"

A state highway near me had snow piled up alongside the road as high as the windows on an 18 wheeler, the only time I have seen it that bad in my area.  There was also a lot of fish kills here that year in area lakes and ponds because of the ice and snow on them!
