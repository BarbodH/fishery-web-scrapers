985169,captpierre,2016-11-04 00:33:00,2521,Last weekend before winterizing my ride. Was out this afternoon for couple hours north end of Pigeon 1 dink on bottom bouncer in 30 ft. Water temp 50 F Does anybody know where they are this time of year? And what works?
985198,jimmer,2016-11-04 13:21:00,2730,"I stopped fishing the kawarthas in the fall captain.  I have lived on Pigeon for over 30 years and fished it longer.  We used to do great in the fall fishing weed lines and any moving water using jigs with minnows.  That all seemed to change when the zebra mussels showed up. I guess I just didn't adjust to the changes.  Deeper water is where I would try, but it's a little far for me to travel by boat to get to the deep water.  I do believe that minnows are the trick."
