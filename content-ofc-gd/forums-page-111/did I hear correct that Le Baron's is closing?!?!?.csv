For musky guys pretty good slectikn of lures left. While in there they actually changed over the signs and it was now 40% off lures and terminal tackle so i loaded up on what I needed/they had and grabbed xome rapalas i didnt need but will be good backups Apparently Markham location has a bit more selection but can't comment on 40% off as stock update was from a friend who was there on Monday Gordy"

984759,captpierre,2016-10-28 13:56:00,2521,Markham store yesterday had good selection of lures. Lots of Rapalas ?  40% off. Rods and reels  picked over. 30%
984807,ch312,2016-10-29 14:18:00,1590,"I'm surprised it took so long for the typically bad customer service and not being open on Sundays to catch up to them. Changing those two thing's could and would have resulted in far more business for them.  Always sad to see an outdoors store close, but I am not surprised when it comes to Lebaron."
985222,Rizzo,2016-11-04 22:33:00,4754,Surprised but not surprised. I used to shop there a lot during the 1990's (Mississauga store). I always found the pricing good but I also found the guys that worked in the rods/reels dept...you know the guys behind that counter....to be rude and condescending...wouldn't give you the time of day
985243,Tjames09,2016-11-05 14:25:00,664,"Still had a decent selection of musky lures. I was able to get a nice musky tackle box for 40% off as well. 40% off all musky stuff, lots of bulldogs and magnums left. Picked over on suicks, believers, jakes, and shallow raiders."

Give me Angling Outfitters, Grimsby Tackle, Natural Sports and the like any day. Sy Ya Na Ra.  Just my $0.02  LeBarons is Canadian.  So, they are not taking profits out of the country.

It was a family owned business that was quite successful for many years. Many started small , I recall the Columbia catalog over 30 years ago was a half dozen pages of fishing vests and the back was their quad parka, none of the yuppie crap. Also growing up near Welland, the now furniture giant Leons was a single family owned store and I believe the family still controls the empire. Seems you are only allowed to get successful to a certain point."

982387,Jon,2016-09-27 18:06:00,209,Just got back from the Mississauga store. Discounts are as previously mentioned. Still lots of stuff but Canada Goose is sold out and survival suits were only XXL or larger. They are giving away the 2016 catalogue and are selling LeBaron t-shirts for those who want to hold on to some history. The guy at the check-out had no idea how long the sale will last or if discounts will increase over time.  LeBaron has been my go to store for almost 30 years. I remember going to the Sportsman show years ago and getting a catalogue or having it arrive in the mail. I also remember the store on Yonge Street and echo the comments about bad customer service at both GTA locations. Prices couldn't be beat though.  Jon
982419,turtle,2016-09-28 10:42:00,274,Filed a proposal in bankruptcy on Sept 21.  Could be a restructuring & keep going or complete closure. Despite its flaws I spent money there since the 1980's.  Still not using electronic SKU bar codes in 2016?

Thanks for any info....not sure if its worth the drive just to be nosey  I was at the Markham location this morning. My friend and I picked up the last 2 Stradic FK reels. Still decent amounts of stock left although popular items like 8lb Berkley XL mono, powerpro, split shots, higher end spinning reels are mostly gone. I went in looking to stock up on only split shots, hooks and a few lures. I ended up spending much much more than I was planning to.LOL  I asked when they were going to be closed. The only answer I got was when everything is gone (including the light bulbs)."

982650,Duckie,2016-10-02 00:11:00,305,"I wonder if the whole 'closed on sunday' thing is part of what hurt them.  they never moved with the times in that regard. back when I worked retail it was common for almost 50% of our business to be done Saturday and sundays. granted, it wasn't fishing retail, but generally, the store was busy on the weekends and not so much during the week when most people worked.  not being open sundays just causes people to go to the competition when they want to shop on that particular day.  Basspro and Sail are open Sundays.. Le Barons never was on Sunday.  pure speculation on my part, but I think it might not have helped."

Ooops ... made a right on Highway 7 to go south on Woodbine ... GOSH! The lineup of cars trying to get into the damn puny parking lot. A crap load of people lining up just to enter the building.Didn't bother to make a left turn into the FULLY JAMMED parking lot. So I hung a left at Yorktech Dr. and then made my way to Bass City (Highway 7 and Kennedy Rd.) in the Subway Plaza just past the railway tracks ... Had a much better time there looking for a rod to replace my 6'6"" Clarus.  Bass City has a way better selection of crankbaits, rods, lines."

Croix and will go elsewhere to get them, be able to shop on sundays etc.  a lot of little things add up and the result itsn't good for business.  on facebook people were really saying how rude most of the staff were at many of their locations.

Only found out about it from a tackle rep. There wasn't a big crowd because no one knew. 20% off everything in store, 50% on selected clothing and footwear. Still lots of tackle left but some of the more popular colour selections are gone. Cleos and Moonshine spoons down to a few.

Back when the Sportsman show was a bigger deal a stop at the Le Baron area was a must for me. Pre-internet the catalog was a staple. I always wished for them to upgrade their website...
982233,Moosebunk,2016-09-25 13:29:00,3970,"That catalogue of theirs (and to a lesser degree Cabelas) was pretty well the only fishing shopping I did for 10 years at each tax return.  Still shop at the store in Ottawa more than anywhere as, their prices are almost always better.  Agree with ya too Raf, the terminal tackle, line and even most lures really, were cheaper to buy there.  Down the road from me 25 minutes now is the new Cabelas here in Ottawa. Le Barons is about 40-45 minutes if traffic is good, SAIL maybe 50 minutes but that's crossing the city only outside of rush hours.  For the Ottawa crowd, Le Baron's was the bigger store closest to west end and SAIL in the east once it opened.  The fishing/hunting crowd in the west end and Ottawa valley, now that Cabelas has opened, likely won't waste the extra 1/2+ hour time and gas just to save a buck or two on small things..,  Surely over the years in Toronto they've suffered too with BPS, Cabelas and SAIL all opening.  Same kinda thing in Montreal.  Like the store, service has been good and bad over the years but with me, the fellas have always been friendly there.  Sucks they're ""restructuring"" to probably closed doors."
982234,dave524,2016-09-25 13:45:00,4508,"Fishing tackle I always bought locally, but for some reloading components I'd make the trip if I couldn't find what I needed at the local gun shows or the few remaining gun shops. I did buy a bunch of salmon stuff when the ""Outdoors Stores "" closed shop in the early 80's. Collegiate Sports bought them out and promptly liquidated the firearms, got me a nice 06 Ruger 77 for real cheap."
982248,muskymatt,2016-09-25 18:51:00,2608,"Ottawa store had going out of business signs all over the store front Saturday morning. The bomb was dropped on them Wednesday and the staff were clearly in shock. 20% off fishing and 50% off everything else. Sad, I liked the business, especially that it is 300 meters from my house lol. Not a huge savings on fishing stuff but that may change. I went to Cabelas on their opening day and thought to myself if LB's would feel the impact and it was literally the next day the announcement was out. I wasn't impressed with Cabelas, prices were high and again an American big box invades Canada."

My gramps also bought me my first rifle there when I was 16 and had just got my first FAC, it was a ruger 10/22.  I'll miss them, even though the service was often awful and they were regularly out of stock on things. I won't miss the bald manager though.  That guy doesn't rate a job washing dish, much less managing a retail outlet."
982274,FrankTheRabbit,2016-09-26 04:22:00,479,It's unfortunate that some people need to gloat at the loss of another. There were some good people who worked there and can't imagine their disbelief that the establishment has a ticking timeline.  A few bad eggs didn't deserve the entire store closing. That might just mean less choices for consumers. How will a mom & pop store compete with the big box stores?  I hope some of the employees can pool together and buy out a location as a Lebarons ver 2.0.
