We hit the water around 11 am and were off by 4:30 pm.  We easily caught over 30 bass using twisters, wacky rigs, and 6 inch Texas rigs.  None of them were over 2 1/2 lbs, but the action was amazing."

984675,AKRISONER,2016-10-27 15:38:00,5558,have the waters reached the elusive 40th temp plateau yet?
