983896,Pikeslayer,2016-10-19 02:24:00,1443,Congratulations to you & your bride Lew.  Only 15 to go for me & mine  to reach that Milestone
983943,Whopper,2016-10-20 02:07:00,2174,"Congrats Lew and your lovely bride. Doesn't surprise me you two have reached this milestone, good people for sure."
983945,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-20 03:06:00,8243,I should give a shout out to my Mom and Dad. Celebrated 63 years on September 26th 2016. They have been arguing about how the toilet paper should go on the holder for as long as I have been alive. Petty  arguments may have kept them together for all these years. I have never heard them have an argument over anything serious. We are blessed to have them both with us. I don't have any friends that have both and very few have even one parent to complain about. They are a handful at 89 and 86 but that's something I have that many others don't and wish they did. Dad calls me to remind me the Ti-Cats or the Bills are on TV! He watches both religiously.
984740,Rattletrap2,2016-10-28 01:48:00,1652,"Congrats Lew and Dianne! i just saw this tonight, but 50 years is certainly something to be proud of!"
