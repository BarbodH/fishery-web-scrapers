Despite it being wet and raw out, the daughter and I headed out to a small creekmouth for some fall crappie. Spot #1 was a bust. No current and no minnows.  20 minute drive down the road to spot #2 fishing from a bridge. No crappie, but lots of slab gills to be had. We got in a good 3 hours chasing bluegills and perch until the raw damp got the better of us.  Guess what's on the menu tomorrow night?????"
