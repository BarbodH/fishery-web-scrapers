I have struck out so far with the usual big box stores in the area.  Easy to find online but hoping just to pick some up.  Any hints would be appreciated.  "

They were for 1 "" square tube but the display board had larger ones. The store is like 5 minutes from me; I could pick them up and mail them to you. We'll worry about payment after we know the cost; but they're inexpensive.  Dan."

Most fastener or industrial supply places (fastenal, bolts plus, acklands, brafasco,spaneur, etc) should either have them, or access to them...."
