984764,OhioFisherman,2016-10-28 14:32:00,6623,LOL! I could have used that mule!
984771,Whitespinnerbait,2016-10-28 15:36:00,2038,I also need that Mule !!!!
984772,Headhunter,2016-10-28 15:47:00,5703,LOL... thanks for the chuckle. Now we await that person who will say that the joke is in bad taste blah blah blah... HH
984773,DanD,2016-10-28 16:15:00,2223,If a mule kicked my mother in-law in the head the poor animal would end up with a broken leg. Yup she's a cement head 100%.  Dan.
984777,cheaptackle,2016-10-28 17:35:00,849,"It was in bad taste blah blah - now nobody else needs to say it so I can jump in and relate just how I had to explain why I was laughing my butt off in school this morning - TWICE!  The first time was when I read the joke, the second time was when I was just thinking someone would hop all over it saying it wasn't PC - that's when the teacher read my screen and said that was disgusting!  Couldn't bring myself to explain why I was laughing all over again, sure didn't want to tell her I was laughing at her and why!  I gotta stop reading this stuff at school (but I can't!)  Michael"
984797,SirCranksalot,2016-10-29 01:12:00,3291,I would have paid him double what he wanted and bought that mule!!!
984798,Beans,2016-10-29 01:48:00,3339,My first wife's mother was a gem of a woman...too bad some of it didn't rub off on her daughter...her I could have used that mule...
984799,GBW,2016-10-29 02:31:00,8460,I no longer have a mother-in-law but I might still go mule shopping to have it 'step up' and sort out a few others...
984851,i2cool2fool,2016-10-30 16:52:00,349,I think I'll tell this joke to my mother-in-law at Christmas dinner.
