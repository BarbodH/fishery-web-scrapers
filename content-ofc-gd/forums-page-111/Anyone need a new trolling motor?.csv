That provided a good laugh at the end of it all (if I was out of pocket I'd probably not be laughing lol).   My wiring to my plug is under 10ft long so 8awg should be fine. The plan was to not rewire completely and use the 8awg and if problems arise and I'm blowing my circuit, upgrade to 6.  But that is all moot now until I stumble on another 24v. The dream still lives. Trying to avoid dropping 2K on a new one but I do have aspirations to upgrade from my 16ft aluminium one day so this might push that dream into reality sooner than later. The old 55lb still gets me by. The ipilot terrova was a nice thought though.. LOL"

I could be wrong, but I don't think that running too skinny of a wire will trip your circuit breaker.  It will just make the wire run hotter (hopefully not hot enough to start a fire) and reduce the performance of the motor.  "

980979,landry,2016-09-04 01:52:00,1005,What pound thrust????
980980,adempsey,2016-09-04 02:21:00,1498,I wonder if someone is going to find a box of used clothes when they go to install their new trolling motor.  Woops!  Lol.
980991,Pigeontroller,2016-09-04 17:20:00,2793,"What pound thrust????  Likely 80. That's a great Price, if I had an extra $1000 sitting around I'd buy it for a spare!"
981048,FishOn,2016-09-05 23:26:00,136,Wondering if it comes with the hand held remote for I-pilot and GPS or is that extra???
981078,Dara,2016-09-06 18:51:00,3052,Sweet deal..that looks like the remote in the bag attached to the shaft to me
981100,tizfun,2016-09-06 23:00:00,292,"Spoke with a lady from there.. It does come with the foot pedal and hand remote..  She said it's an 80 lbs 54"" shaft with i-pilot, auto-pilot and US2.  The bag you see has everything in it...  Picking it up tomorrow morning @ 9:00am when they open.. I'm out that way for work tomorrow so what the hell..  I have a Terrova now 60"" shaft with all the same features except for i-pilot.. New this year.. it'll be on Kijiji later this week..   Thanks for the heads up.."

981111,tizfun,2016-09-07 01:41:00,292,It is a super deal...  I really don't care for spot lock too much...  remember... new motors will mean increased prices.  I'm not willing to pay almost 2k for the same motor..

985368,JoshS,2016-11-07 15:43:00,729,"Here's a bit of a funny story...  Thought I'd update everyone as I was the lucky guy who bought this motor! I've been in the market for awhile and this was the one I could't refuse (LOL). Brought it home super excited to install it, took off the old 55lb powerdrive, decided to upgrade my trolling motor plug and circuit breaker, bought two new deep cycles and some other stuff for the install. Mounted everything, wired it all up to my new 24v system and with great excitement popped it down for the first time to test it. Hmm.. it didn't want to turn on for some reason? I couldn't figure it out. Spent some time going through everything over and over and still couldn't get to the bottom of it! Stumped, I uninstalled it, brought it to Aikman's and with a millisecond glance at the motor he tells me... ""that's a 55lb"". We had a good laugh at all the work I put into almost getting my new terrova. He tested it and all worked so I sold it to some lucky guy who saved a few hundred off retail.  Back to the old 12 volt system and 55lber until the time comes again!  The old saying ""If it seems to good to be true, it probably is"" held up nicely for this deal. Makes me laugh thinking about the whole ordeal.  You're a lucky guy Tizfun LOL!"

I did that for years with my Terrova 55 and then when I upgraded to the 80 just re-wired them to series for 24V...."

I did that for years with my Terrova 55 and then when I upgraded to the 80 just re-wired them to series for 24V....  I might one day but I returned the 2 new deep cycles in a huff and puff and sold the terrova. I have a 12v now and it gets me by... didn't want a $1000 new one, even if it's a terrova. I'm holding out for 24v. In any ripping wind, my 12v's like spot lock, barely pushes the boat. It's the more power I'm after.  I didn't mention the part about almost converting a part of my casting deck into a new hatch to easily fit both new batteries without having to awkwardly slide them into my size one battery compartment. Even procured the hole saw and was a day away from ordering the latch and hinges for my new battery compartment. Almost cut a big hole in my floor for the new motor.. Close call lol."

I'm just glad I stuck with the 8awg wire and at least saved the effort of rewiring with 6awg... and making a new boat hatch! Makes me laugh thinking about it...  Actually, the 6 gauge wire would be a good idea.  It is counter intuitive to a lot of people, but it's the 12 volt motors that require the heavier gauge wires.  Higher voltage motors draw fewer amps than low voltage motors.  Eight gauge should be okay if you are only running a few feet from your battery to the plug.  If it's a longer run than you should run six gauge."

Your #8 wire will be fine for your 80lb 24V motor unless it's crazy long.   If anything, your 55lb motor will draw more current at 12V than the 80 will at 24V.  They recommend a 60A breaker for both as well:  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/Support/Battery-Selection---Rigging/"
