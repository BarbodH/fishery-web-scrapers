984125,bigcreekdad,2016-10-22 12:52:00,546,"I've been making my own for a few decades. Just need jig heads, bucktail (any fly tying outfit will have them - the whole piece of the tail is cheapest), a cheap fly tying vice, and a fly tying bobbin with strong fly tying thread. It's easy, and you can make them as long and thick as you want, in many colors, and can paint the heads any way you want."
984128,captpierre,2016-10-22 13:12:00,2521,Might have to try that for my worn out bucktail Muskie in-line spinners. I have several that are pretty naked of hair but otherwise still good.

I used ones like this for years, they would catch just about anything, and some big fish for a 1/8th ounce lure.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Castlebaits-Bucktail-Hair-Jig-Olive-2pk-1-8oz-/112142913280?hash=item1a1c3d0f00:g:-VkAAOSwNRdX4SRX  I took Uncle Josh pork grubs and threaded rubber from a koosh ball I took apart to make legs on the grub.  Ebay has a lot of them listed, but most are USA locations."
