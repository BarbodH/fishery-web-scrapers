I came across this and I'm awaiting a reply, but I'm not too optimistic as the ad was posted 6 weeks ago and only $200 for the 6 of them, regardless I'd like to try and find some like them, and with a group like there is here I'm sure someone might be able to point me in the right direction    Thanks!"
