984865,GBW,2016-10-30 22:52:00,8460,"we have a 1/2 one (no top other than a removable one to add wood and reduce sparks) of wild animals.  It wasn't much either as places like CostCo and others are now selling them.  But that image the person making it did a heck of a job!  I'd rather the ""death star"" then if custom work is in play..."
984877,Canuck,2016-10-31 00:52:00,491,"Ok.  I did some googlin'  Turns out they are pretty established and well known.  Very unique and have done some very well known projects, like the steel cone sculptures in front of the Air Canada Centre.  The web site is pretty interesting.  Nice to see a successful business in the little ol town of Lafontaine.  http://www.liwi.ca/"

984905,Fang,2016-10-31 16:25:00,1330,The BBQ shop by me in Oakville had a couple small ones and pricing was around $+600 each. A buddy had one and depending on where you sat the heat coming off certain spots was like a blast furnace  Would be crazy cool to have ones with distinct lakes carved out
