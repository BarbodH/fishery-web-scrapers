Fishing here is amazing.  our spot under the bridge.  one of many double headers.  pufferfish this thing blew up like crazy when I grabbed it.  parrot fish  the missus with a little jack and some nice gloves......lol So many different species to catch you never know whats on the end of your line all fish were caught on a jig with a piece of shrimp.
