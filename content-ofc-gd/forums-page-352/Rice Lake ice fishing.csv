745090,turtle,2012-11-19 11:52:00,274,"I am interested in getting out on Rice Lk this winter.  Only fished it twice out of the boat in the last 25 years, launched from Bewdley & Serpent Mounds, so looking for general directions, not waypoints.  Looking for access points and parking to walk out.  I have no problem walking and pulling a pop-up shelter 1 km or more each way, unless of course on deep unpacked snow. I am familar with fishing perch on Simcoe although I suspect there are more weed beds on Rice than Simcoe.  For me Simcoe perch is about fishing sand flats and moving around.  Looking for input on Rice, incl. whether you can fish bluegills same/similar to perch. For crappie, I probably don't want to stay out after dark. Thank-you."
