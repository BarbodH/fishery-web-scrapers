Caught six different species nothing huge but lots of cool looking fish didn't get pics if all of them but here's a few. Going out on a party boat tomorrow and a back country charter on sunday lots of pics and reports to follow."
744379,Christopheraaron,2012-11-15 22:41:00,3525,"First ones a Pompano and I don't know about the second, nice fish!"
744390,fish_fishburn,2012-11-15 22:57:00,1311,You lucky dog. Cant wait to see more pics.
744395,captpierre,2012-11-15 23:07:00,2521,Gotta love saltwater.  Never know what's on the other end.  Then all of a sudden a shark comes and takes it all  Have a great time
744399,bare foot wader,2012-11-15 23:18:00,1354,"saltwater is such an amazing experience...good luck tomorrow  word of the wise, tip in advance  when you're on the party boat, tip the captain or the first mate doing all the grunt work, preparing bait and rods....they'll hand you the rod when they hook up a good one  all the party boats i've been on were basically bottom fishing, everybody had their own rod, with frozen bait....then they have a few kite rods or even just freelining livebait, herring usually....that gets the sail 99% of the time  whereabouts in the backcountry? post pics  cheers."
744426,lickmyarmpit,2012-11-15 23:51:00,359,"Thanks for the tips barefoot will do for sure. Chris I thought the first was a little jack crevalle (long fins spot on the gill plate and a sharp bony edge on the tail)  second is a snapper of some kind a snapper mutton I believe. Other catches were yellowtail snappers , porgy,mullet and a bunch of grunts."
744433,BillM,2012-11-16 00:06:00,17367," That's not a Pomp, eyes are way too big as is the mouth..    Looks like Jack to me.. Vicious fish!  Second is a red snapper."
744438,Christopheraaron,2012-11-16 00:15:00,3525,  Either way I'd love to have it on the end of my line  
744442,timmeh,2012-11-16 00:35:00,609,"Awesome stuff. Back country is great, light tackle for hard fighting fish.  Try firing a gold spoon around just before sunset if you get the chance. Bridges can hold some big snook.  As for the fish i think you've got a jack and a mangrove snapper."
744443,BillM,2012-11-16 00:42:00,17367,"My fav thing to toss in Florida is a Doc's Goofy jig and half a shrimp.  Have caught pretty much everything on that.. Pomps, whitings, ladyfish, sheepheads, bonnet head sharks!  "
744445,Salmonidstalker,2012-11-16 00:50:00,265,Don't give the salmon snaggers any ideas BillM.
744447,BillM,2012-11-16 00:50:00,17367, LOL!
744448,lickmyarmpit,2012-11-16 00:54:00,359,"That's almost the same setup I was using, 1/4 oz jigs with half a shrimp. Live bait angling has to be done with a circle hook its a newer rule.  Maybe I should try a marshmallow.........lol"
744450,Rich Nelson,2012-11-16 00:56:00,332,Love fishin Florida... Never know what you are gonna hook into
744466,_Ra_,2012-11-16 01:39:00,16, yep I think you're right. Mutton snapper and jack. thats what I was told anyway! Grunts were by far my favourite.  
744467,_Ra_,2012-11-16 01:42:00,16,2 more! some of these fish look so exotic. Its a blast catch them.  
744468,BillM,2012-11-16 01:43:00,17367,This is what we catch!  Bonnethead sharks!  This little guy was about 36inches.  
744473,lickmyarmpit,2012-11-16 02:00:00,359,So cool awesome fish guys
