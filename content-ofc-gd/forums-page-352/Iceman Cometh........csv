744428,Rod Caster,2012-11-15 23:54:00,5784,The ice man liveth north of here. Still in the pluses around here. Happy idiot of a dog I gather? Haha
744464,Old Man,2012-11-16 01:38:00,822," I think you're being a little optimistic Simon, but then again, if you listen to my wife says, I'm wrong quite often."
744469,limeyangler,2012-11-16 01:46:00,5204,  Maybe ...maybe not...its fun guessing though....and i cant help my optimism...i live to fish!  Either way...its rare not to be on the ice by the end of the first week in December
744470,Old Man,2012-11-16 01:53:00,822, Your right Simon. Just looked back through some old photos of 1st days on the ice and most them are dated the end of November. I guess I'm just in denial about winter.
744488,chris.brock,2012-11-16 03:08:00,4053,"It was probably around 1987, I remember snowmobiling on 10""s of clear ice and a foot of powder snow on a lake in Haliburton, the last weekend in November"
744516,Jen,2012-11-16 05:11:00,833,That sounds like the perfect weekend doesn't it!
744616,brkygetr,2012-11-16 20:40:00,425,"Every year Simon around this time I think of the speck lake, and every year I wonder what made me leave???? We'll be lucky to see 'good' ice down here this year if last year was any indication"
744158,limeyangler,2012-11-15 00:19:00,5204,"Hi all,  Woke this morning to see the lake froze over coast to coast so to speak. Was a thin crust, but it means the lakes are ready to go as soon as we get a cold snap. Wind forecast for tonite might undo some of this....but hopefully we will have a nice early start to the icefishing season....earliest i have seen since i moved here 6 years ago was November 23rd.....actually on the ice fishing on that day.   Jack had a blast throwing rocks and it was good to see our new pup...stoopid as he can sometimes be....was smart enough not to chase rocks and such onto thin ice....and responded to my commands to stay off when he seemed determined to try his luck!  Kicked a hole in the ice and a little minnow like fish popped out on the ice...I have included a picture...any thoughts what it is?   Anyhoo.....BRING ON THE ICE....cant fricken hardly wait already!       <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/WzrQ5GkrEAQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                                             Fired the Auger today...fired up good without much effort. Good to go.    Here's wishing everyone a successful icefishing season....LET THE GAMES BEGIN (soon)"
744159,woodenboater,2012-11-15 00:25:00,2277,I dunno about the fishing but I'd be sharpening my skates and prepare to chase the puck down the entire length of the lake
744163,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 00:37:00,8333,We're still sun tanning in our swimsuits down here in the balmy south.
744165,limeyangler,2012-11-15 00:43:00,5204,  To be honest its not that cold here last niight was the first time its been -10C since last spring. we have had a long autumn this year...turned cold in september and never really recovered so the water has been close to freezing point now for about a month....did not take much to skim the lake.
744170,kickingfrog,2012-11-15 00:52:00,8333,"My personal education of my son needs some work I guess. He didn't understand how the lake could be frozen and the fish still swimming. Doesn't get top-down, figures it is bottom-up."
744171,crappieperchhunter,2012-11-15 00:55:00,2582,"Thx for reminding me that this is my ""I hate Limey"" time of year.  I can hardly wait for your first ice fishing report so I can print off a picture and have something to throw darts at  Play safe."
744175,Slop,2012-11-15 01:12:00,151,That is a sight for sore eyes right there!...still got some days  of slaying Bass in the valley to go yet. Don't forget to charge-up the x67 dood. Very much looking forward to your reports on the hard schtuff.  Jack's secret island....lol!
744181,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-15 01:23:00,10439,The Iceman hereth in Yellowknife already.  
744185,bigugli,2012-11-15 01:46:00,6138, X2
744187,limeyangler,2012-11-15 01:49:00,5204,  Hey...dont hate on me....hate that Dave dude from Yellowknife...he's already fishing on the ice.....gimme a break!
744190,bigugli,2012-11-15 01:58:00,6138,"Not so much hate as jealousy.  As for Dave, he's so far north, a warm intimate evening involves cuddling with his sled dogs"
744191,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-15 02:07:00,10439,  Nah we burn caribou pellets in our wood stoves.    :tease:
744192,ProFishermanJones,2012-11-15 02:08:00,77,enjoyed the video! and awesome pictures
744193,NAW,2012-11-15 02:23:00,4022,Man oh man. What I would give to be sipping baileys and coffee jiggin whitties on Simcoe this weekend!
744208,Old Man,2012-11-15 03:20:00,822,Not sure if it's here to stay yet Simon. we're warming up quite a bit starting Sunday.    Tonight   Thu   Fri   Sat   Sun   Mon   Tue  
744211,Grimace,2012-11-15 04:01:00,2020,I love that chocolate lab.  My dream dog!
744212,limeyangler,2012-11-15 05:00:00,5204,"  Believe it or not Gord....I too look at the long range forecast  Like I said...wind will get rid of what we have probably....but first cold snap we get now and the lake is done....she,so cold and it won't take much..and the temps in the near future will not be warming the lake.....that's for sure."
744213,limeyangler,2012-11-15 05:16:00,5204, Lololol...come and get the dumb mutt...he's all yours!  Just kidding (only just)
744219,lew,2012-11-15 11:11:00,12766,C'mon springtime
744262,Jds63,2012-11-15 15:47:00,1365,"Hey Simon, ... looking forward to see some new ice fishing vids ..."
744268,Joeytier,2012-11-15 16:17:00,3990,"AWESOME!  I'm still hoping to be out first week of Dec., but it's looking less and less likely. I've seen skims of ice come and go for a while now, but not looking like any cold snaps coming any time soon."
744312,adolson,2012-11-15 19:10:00,783,"I'm a tad jealous.. For the first time in my life, I can't freaking wait to get on the ice. I've got a list of lakes to try and reach this season. The tough part will be finding parking somewhere close, since none of them are in my back yard and I don't have a sled or ATV."
744318,misfish,2012-11-15 20:23:00,29133,Rolof has turned into a beautiful dog Simon.  
744425,limeyangler,2012-11-15 23:50:00,5204," Bah! Humbug!   Cool Jd...looking forward to getting on the ice!   Where you at Joey? I,my thinking we will be on the ice by first week in December....secretly holding out for a week earlier than that.    Awesome Dana..a convert!    Yeah...dumb as hecan be is is a very handsome beast."
744427,bigugli,2012-11-15 23:53:00,6138,Give him some time. He'll have you trained soon enough
