I'm sure he'd appreciate me putting this fish pic up for him. Two days ago he landed his PB steelhead while fishing a local trib with me. The only credit I can take here is that I took the picture. Rob traversed a straight mud cliff, hanging from tree limbs and beat himself up pretty bad just to get into the whirlpool where he knew this fish was holding. I wasn't so adventurous, I stayed where it was moderate hiking conditions. lol Well anywho, when he monkey flipped himself into knee-deep mud, it wasn't long before a giant smashed his spoon. What a fish for Rob! I was just as excited as he was I think, just to be there and experience that. I see the addiction to steelheading.. lol    :clapping:    Nice work Rob! Can't wait to get into the double digits myself!"
744537,Live2fish85,2012-11-16 13:15:00,1633,Nice fish.  I should fish some Erie tribs.
744544,Roy,2012-11-16 13:35:00,13728,Beauty fish there Rich. Congratulate Rob for us. I look at the face on that fish and can almost imagine him saying something. Comical face with the droopy looking eye.
744553,Victor,2012-11-16 14:02:00,1609,"That's awesome. He put in the hardwork and got rewarded. That's the best kind.  I always try to do all sorts of things to get ""rewarded"", like climbing down a steel muddy hill, wading chest deep to cross the river for a ""better spot"", and most of the time I come out empty handed"
744554,asdve23rveavwa,2012-11-16 14:04:00,2690,"Good stuff Rich, and, congrats to Rob.  That fish has character!"
744566,Joey,2012-11-16 15:06:00,9122,"Congratulate Rob for us Rich, that is a gorgeous PB!"

745093,Rich,2012-11-19 12:19:00,3927," It seems with the exception of one day bottom bouncing bags, the hardware is scoring regularly for us! Rob says thanks everyone for the congrats."
745139,FishTracker,2012-11-19 17:52:00,47,What a fish!  That steelie must have smashed that hardware like a freight train!  Great pic too!  Thanks for sharing.
