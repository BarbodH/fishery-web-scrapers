Hit my favorite early season laker spot and landed a few small ones and a few small burbot as well. Lost a bunch of lakers and burbies too (darn barbless regs!!!    ). Got to the lake and went to start the old Strikemaster annnnnd................................ the old pig took 2 whole yanks to get her started!!! We got good ice but need more snow. The trail in was pretty rough and I had some issues in a couple of places spinning the track out on gravel but there is some snow on the way. We have enough Ice now that a foot of snow would be most welcome. Anywho, here's some porn for y'all!!! Enjoy!!!!    Got a new tent for the old Trekker II (replaced the original with a Trekker DLX tent which is twice as thick)            "
