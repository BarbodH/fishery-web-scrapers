744264,jedimaster,2012-11-15 15:51:00,3472,"I went to that place once, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, although I don't think I would recognize a snakehead in an aquarium though without comparing pictures when I was there."
744265,fishindevil,2012-11-15 15:55:00,6254,It's because they are selling them in back room aquariums they know its illegal and still do it it's all about the money supply and demand
744271,Sinker,2012-11-15 16:19:00,8692,"The worste part is they don't sell them to eat. They are sold to be released, and bring the buyers good fortune!!!  S."
744330,kemper,2012-11-15 21:02:00,2232,"I've been in that place before, when I was working a summer job in highschool delivering beer to a karaoke bar upstairs. The owner of the bar (a kid, MAYBE 21-22) tried to pay us off in cash at significantly less than the final bill.  After convincing him that we were NOT, in fact, and illegal liquor operation (I guess the branded delivery truck didn't give it away?) he took us downstairs to our fish selling friend here that ultimately wrote the cheque for him. My guess is that most of the operations in that joint are shady..."

744391,Snidley,2012-11-15 22:58:00,620,Snakeheads can't survive out winters but all the same it's disturbing that backward cultural traditions are potentially compromising our environment. By far the more dangerous shipment was the live Asian Carp that were being brought across the border a few months back. That and the fact that the Yanks are not taking the Asian Carp around Chicago seriously.
744392,Christopheraaron,2012-11-15 23:01:00,3525," What!? If they can live in new york you can be sure they'll survive up here, even if they didn't survive the winters they could wipe out any small waterbody in a season!"
744460,Snidley,2012-11-16 01:24:00,620,Where in New York are Snakeheads? The closest I have seen is the Potomac River
744462,Snidley,2012-11-16 01:36:00,620,Actually I'm wrong. They have been found in Flushing NY and Philly. The same document says they could have a range from Mississippi to Hudson Bay. The picture shows an animal that is definitely not an oil painting.

744508,northernpike56,2012-11-16 04:18:00,717,"Why is there not a jail sentence? I'm not saying that because I just want to see our fisheries thrive, but because can you can't really imagine the amount of destruction those things would cause to our great lakes fisheries if they were introducted. Billions of dollars of damage if you count in all the money that was put in to make our lakes so great, the cost of getting rid of them, and the cost of bringing back self-sustaining populations."
