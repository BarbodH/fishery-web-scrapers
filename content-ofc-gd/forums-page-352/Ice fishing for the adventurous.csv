744290,wantabigone,2012-11-15 17:30:00,97,I thought I would let and die hard ice fisherman know of an outfitter I have been to that offers ice fishing.  http://www.ogokilakeoutfitters.com/  The cabin is really top notch for an outpost and half the adventure would be getting there in this case. (snowmobile) I doubt anyone has taken Ritch up on his offer. I just figured I would post this in case anyone would be interested.
