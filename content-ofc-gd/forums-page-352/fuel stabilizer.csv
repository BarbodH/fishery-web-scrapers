744634,linweir,2012-11-16 22:45:00,202,"When winterizing a 4 stroke outboard, I add fuel stabilizer into gas tank, but don't run the engine. Will it cause any problem?"
744635,aplumma,2012-11-16 22:46:00,6896,It would be best to run the engine till you have stabilizer in the fuel circuit. It will prevent varnish from forming and protect it as well from corrosion.   Art
744639,davey buoy,2012-11-16 22:57:00,5505,"As Art says, run for 10 mins.That's it."
744641,Sinker,2012-11-16 23:00:00,8692,"The whole point of stabilizer is to get it thru the whole fuel system to prevent gumming, and varnishing. If you don't get it to the carbs, or injectors, you kind of defeating the purpose.  I realize it keeps your gas ""fresh"", but keeping your carbs/injectors clean is just as important.  I use seafoam myself. In every tank.  S."
744650,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-16 23:41:00,10439,I put stabilizer in every tank. Then you don't need to do anything.
744669,whiskywizard,2012-11-17 01:11:00,305," Can you run it in the driveway, on earmuffs and a garden hose?  Disconnect the fuel line from the engine end, push in the little check ball and allow the fuel in the hose to drain back into the tank. Slosh the tank around to mix the stabilizer you added. Reconnect the fuel line, pump it up, start water flow to muffs, start the outboard and you'll have fuel to the carb float bowls inside of 2 minutes."
744671,Old Man,2012-11-17 01:17:00,822, I do the same thing. Marine Grade Stabil in every fill.
744672,fishindevil,2012-11-17 01:22:00,6254,Yes same here seafoam all the time in my Yamaha four stroke outboard and some marine stabilizer at end of season !!! Oh ya and I run seafoam in my Yamaha sled too !!!!! Great stuff
744709,bigbuck,2012-11-17 10:03:00,2449,"Drop the correct amount or a bit more for a full load in the tank and then top it off to mix it or take the boat/trailer for a 5 minute drive so the fuel sloshes around a bit to mix. Hook up the muffs and fire it up for 10-15 minutes to get the stabilizer throughout the fuel system. WARNING, if using Marine Stabil, double the dose if you use it to stabilize, it has more cleaners in it but less stabilizers so a double dose will work fine.  That comes from their website. That's the stuff I use in my I/O starting Labour Day weekend I drop it in every time I put fuel in. CT always puts it on special in the spring and in the fall. Buy a big bottle and it will last a good couple of years."
744718,Moosebunk,2012-11-17 13:13:00,3970,  Foam about every second to third tank here.  And stabalizer for exactly what you said above.  Bravo started first pull and ran at idle for 15 minutes no issue last week.  That's stablized and ready for winter!!!
744725,Handlebarz,2012-11-17 13:42:00,3790,I use it in all tanks of fuel glad I did the last couple years as my season ended early and I did not get around to adding more but was covered. Never had a problem.
744836,Fish Farmer,2012-11-18 04:16:00,2234,"After the stabilizer, pull the plugs and squirt 2 stroke oil in the cylinders and turn over the motor with the kill cord pulled then put the plugs back in."
