744597,Terry,2012-11-16 19:11:00,14456,it depends on how or why they are using my photo I had a lodge I had never been at use a photo of me with a big pike and a fish gif I used here  and they even had the nerve to just link to where I had it hosted......  I changed the photo and gif to a bunch of words describing a sex act and something about his mother too.. went back to the site and the old photo was still there refreshed the page and low and behold there were the words of wisdom..........I bet he never steals photos  or animations again

744365,lew,2012-11-15 22:30:00,12766," At lest 4 times Roy, hope she's getting some kind of royalties"
744368,Terry,2012-11-15 22:31:00,14456,all photos seem to be linked to other sites so as long as the person who took the photo put them there ...no problem

744409,lew,2012-11-15 23:36:00,12766," If it's on the internet Bill, it MUST be true"
744417,Terry,2012-11-15 23:41:00,14456,well the way google works is it looks for a match to all words then it starts looking for matches for fewer and fewer of the words so at some point it will be looking for just the words pictures and lake  or just lake
744495,Joey,2012-11-16 03:23:00,9122,"Hmmm, that is weird, I've never loaded to that site before, only this one and Clive asked if he could put the carp one on FishingFury and I agreed to that!  I notice in their photo section, alot of the photos are ones I took.  One even dates back to when we had the old blue Chev"
744501,Joey,2012-11-16 03:31:00,9122,"Okay, now I want my royalties for this one  link"
744525,bigugli,2012-11-16 11:31:00,6138,"If you use Photobucket, the images you put up become part of the ""community""  domain.  Outside of advertising, there has to be some way the site pays for itself."
