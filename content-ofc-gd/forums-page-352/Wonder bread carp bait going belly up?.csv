744562,i2cool2fool,2012-11-16 14:45:00,349,"This is not good news if you like Wonder Bread, Ding Dongs and Twinkies.  ""Hostess Brands, baker of iconic Twinkies cakes, said Friday it asked a court's permission to shut down the entire company after a strike crippled its operations.""  http://m.nbcnews.com/business/hostess-maker-twinkies-ding-dongs-says-closing-business-1C7112898  I am hopeful this thread will be more about impact of these products used by families and fisherman (and gals) and less about unions."
744570,hammercarp,2012-11-16 15:16:00,964,Tragic to hear of so many jobs being lost and yes some carp anglers swear by Wonderbread and are saddened by the thought.
744572,woodenboater,2012-11-16 15:27:00,2277,"The sooner people stop eating over processed breads (read white), the better. The occasional hot dog or burger bun is alright but not as a regular part of the diet. Don't get me going about the sugar laden junk foods either  Of course this isn't just a Wonder bread issue but an industry wide problem and I do feel for those who could lose their jobs."
744573,Rich,2012-11-16 15:54:00,3927,This crushes the whole plot of Zombieland!
744574,jedimaster,2012-11-16 16:05:00,3472,Or is it just the start of the zombie days ahead? First a bacon Shortage now a Twinkie shortage.... I heard that the Canadian Plants may continue to operate. Eitherway someone will buy the brands. I used to work for Sweetripe. They owned Allens and Everfresh juices. Allen's apple juice was sold off when sweetripe shut its doors. Twinkie will live on.
744575,blaque,2012-11-16 16:11:00,2419, Woody Harrelson will not be pleased
744580,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-16 16:55:00,10439,I could hear the crys of dispair from stoners everywhere this morning. Didn't know why until I heard this news. I'm sure you will see Twinkie hoarding and the resulting stoner fights as this news makes it through the ranks.
744582,Terry,2012-11-16 17:09:00,14456,Woody Harrelson would roll over in his  grave Wait he's not dead This would kill him then.
744587,kickingfrog,2012-11-16 18:02:00,8333,"The bread, snacks and chips will still be made in Canada. Time to soup up the car for some smuggling."
744588,dave524,2012-11-16 18:05:00,4508,"Think it will be business as usual in Canada, the Wonderbread name is owned by George Weston/ Loblaws here and the Hostess/Fritolay Brand by Saputo out of Montreal. Not structured anything like the Hostess brand in the states. BTW Hostess does not have twinkies in Canada"
744599,Terry,2012-11-16 19:15:00,14456,"no twinkies , then what was I eating at the rock concert in the 70's that I couldn't really remember the next day but I do remember eating twinkies.......I hope...lol"
744851,Rich,2012-11-18 12:04:00,3927,"Stoners will move on to the next edible snack item, cookies, cake, candy, milk bones..  And of course there's Twinkies in Canada. I stare at the hostess display all day, everyday at work."
744861,bigugli,2012-11-18 13:49:00,6138,True Canajun stoners ate Joe Louis' and half moons
744862,Roy,2012-11-18 13:52:00,13728, And May Wests.
744871,dave524,2012-11-18 14:56:00,4508," Yep, Vachon cakes for Canuck stoners"
744872,i2cool2fool,2012-11-18 15:01:00,349,My brother and I raced to see who could eat a Vachon coconut log roll the fastest when kids. Good times.
744875,ch312,2012-11-18 15:12:00,1590,this is all they were talking about on the radio in january when we went to florida. i wonder why it took so long for the news to get here?
