I also picked up a float combo and I am loving it more and more every time. As much as I love catching fish there are other things that are as nice to. Like standing in the river and hearing a branch break and looking over to find this,      That was the second buck that day that crossed the river close to us that day. The first was alot bigger but we weren't able to get a picture. That being said the fishing on that trib was garbage so we took off to another.  We were at the other trib and instantly seen this while walking to the water.    I was able to get about 15' from them before they ran about 10' farther haha.  Sorry the pics aren't great, they are from my cell and I was trying to be quick.  Anyways here are some fish from some of the outings.          I hope to one day be the half the fisherman Mr. Borger is haha. Saying that Mike has helped me a ton with certain questions I have had as well as my friend Josh. There help has easily made my hook percentage alot better. So thank you guys.  Hope you enjoy."
744227,cuzza,2012-11-15 12:54:00,467,Where's your fly rod?  Just kidding  I break out the float rod around this time of year too - nice going on the fish!
744228,asdve23rveavwa,2012-11-15 12:55:00,2690,"Great stuff, Chris!!  Love the deer shots as much as the chrome.....well, almost as much, LOL!!!!"
744230,solopaddler,2012-11-15 13:05:00,8605,We'll have to get out together sometime soon Chris. Nice looking fish!
744231,Live2fish85,2012-11-15 13:14:00,1633,"Thanks cuzza, the fly rod has been out a few times and I did manage to get a brown on it. After being able to catch more in one trip with the pin then I did in those few days with the fly I will take the pin over the fly until I learn to fish with the fly better. I know I won't learn if I don't try. I am just waiting till I get out with someone who can show me some things haha.  Frank, thank you. I as well love seeing the deer. Nothing more peaceful then being out on the river and seeing them.  Thanks Mike, sounds good to me. Fishing with you was a blast last time."
744321,misfish,2012-11-15 20:29:00,29133,"Cool to see the deer Chris. Up here, later in the winter months,they are more common (yarding). Floating away,and all of a sudden theres a snap,turn,and there they are.  Nice fish BTW.  Looking forward to hooking up soon."
744387,Live2fish85,2012-11-15 22:55:00,1633,"Thanks Brian, if that is something you see commonly up there then I will have to make a trip up there as well haha. I have seen plenty of them as everyone probably but when you see them on the river it is a different feeling. At least I find.  Can wait to get out with you as well."
744420,Rod Caster,2012-11-15 23:45:00,5784,I know nothing of cameras but those look like real good quality photos! The smile says it all man
744422,MJL,2012-11-15 23:46:00,2427,Nicely done Chris. Great catches for sure. I really like the 1st pic of the buck.
744424,Live2fish85,2012-11-15 23:48:00,1633,"Thanks Chad. The pictures are all from my phone, mind you it is a new phone with a decent camera. I really need to get a waterproof, shockproof camera. A few times now I have fumbled the phone and lucky I caught it."
744430,misfish,2012-11-15 23:57:00,29133," Thats called,BUCK FEVER."
744431,Live2fish85,2012-11-16 00:00:00,1633,"Brian, I wouldn't mind that fever every day haha.  Thanks MJL."
744432,Twocoda,2012-11-16 00:05:00,4130,Nice shooting Chris...both with the rod and the phone...i was wandering up the river the other morning and came across a group/herd/bunch/? of Wild Turkeys...Buggers are definitely faster then they look...
744435,BillM,2012-11-16 00:09:00,17367,"Did a drift a few weeks ago, had 30 or so turkeys fly across the river, lol!   That was a sight."
744439,Live2fish85,2012-11-16 00:18:00,1633,"That's awesome Dave and Bill. I got to get out on the river again soon.  I haven't been in over a week and I am going through withdrawl haha. That being said, I have to get my fix off musky before it closes. The only wildlife we see on St. Clair is ducks taking off after you hear the guns fire haha."
744440,spincast,2012-11-16 00:29:00,3279,nice shooting there Chris - you're making me jealous
744451,Live2fish85,2012-11-16 00:58:00,1633,Thanks Rick. You and G should join for a few hours if it is nice weather out.
744453,spincast,2012-11-16 01:00:00,3279,"Now the quest for the BB is over, I'm hoping to bud."
744456,Live2fish85,2012-11-16 01:05:00,1633,Yea I can believe it. We will have to arrange something for sure.
