745096,bigcreekdad,2012-11-19 12:37:00,546,"For any who are interested in CO's and their job, check out a series of novels written by Joseph Heywood. The series is called the Woods Cop Series, and features a conservation officer in Michigan's upper peninsula. Great story lines, unique characters, and very good reads. Joe has spent up to 3 months a year accompanying CO's on their daily duties, so he uses these actual experiences for ideas in his novels. For those thinking these novels are limited to writing tickets for not having a license, you'll be very surprised. Give one a try....my first was ""Running Dark"", and it hooked me.  As an aside Joe also wrote the best novel I've ever read that has fly fishing as the theme, but it's not what you might expect. I've read it twice."
