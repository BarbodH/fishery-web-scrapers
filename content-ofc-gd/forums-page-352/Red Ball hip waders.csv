744768,SirCranksalot,2012-11-17 19:39:00,3291,I'm having trouble finding a pair of hip waders in the stores that I like and that fit. There's a pair of neoprene Red Ball's for sale (supposedly great cond)on Kijiji for $80. Would you consider that a reasonable price?
744769,misfish,2012-11-17 19:54:00,29133,Red balls were a great brand back in the day. Not sure what their like now. 80 bucks? Maybe buy new for that price.
744795,kemper,2012-11-18 00:34:00,2232,"I'd never buy waders used, almost every pair of waders develops a leak at some point in their life and that's usually when they go up for sale.  If there's one thing I've learned about gear in the last few years its to buy the best quality gear you can possibly afford even if it means waiting for a while.  I spent 5 or so years burning through cheap equipment and being cold and wet all the time. This year I bit the bullet and upgraded everything and I'm warm and dry every single day on the water. Changes everything."
745109,torco,2012-11-19 14:13:00,656,I had a pair of red ball neoprenes for many years they worked well but always leaked around the crothc. A patch would last for a while but it was always the crotch because of the seam.  It is black friday this week and a couple years ago I got a great deal from Cabelas on a new breathable waders. It would be worth looking at doing some internet shopping this week.
