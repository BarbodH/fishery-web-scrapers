743759,206,2012-11-13 21:42:00,563,When you store your boat on trailer for the winter do you put the trailer up on stands to take the weight off the springs and tires?  thanks
743762,Handlebarz,2012-11-13 21:44:00,3790,I never have and have not had problems.
743763,davey buoy,2012-11-13 21:44:00,5505," Yes,all 3000lbs plus of her.The wheels spin freely."
743772,lew,2012-11-13 22:08:00,12766,"Yup, been doing it for years, front, center & rear.  Don't know if it's necessary or not but I always do it.       "
743783,Cast-Away,2012-11-13 22:55:00,790,"Yes I do, I have been told that the tires can develop a flat spot if you leave them on the ground."
743787,irishfield,2012-11-13 22:59:00,26272,Definitely... give those springs a break and keep your tires round (and sidewalls damage free). At least 32 days away for mine though....
743790,Billy Bob,2012-11-13 23:03:00,5865," The OLD nylon tires would develop flat spots but not today's tires...  I find it huge waste of time, effort and the chance of a accident to put your trailer up on blocks.....I have the same boat trailer since 1985 (27 years) and have never had a problem with the tires or suspension....and LOOK....there are many cars and trucks out there standing on the same tires and suspension without problems....but if you have nothing better to do....then jack it ""up"".....LOL...."
743793,irishfield,2012-11-13 23:06:00,26272,Glad you never had any old cars I wanted to buy from you BB. You'd do yourself (and what's riding in your boat) a world of favour if you let those leaf springs rest and re arch themselves each off season. The only accident that's going to happen slapping the axle stands under the frame is you can't get your ass back up standing straight again!
743794,Billy Bob,2012-11-13 23:10:00,5865,:rolleyes:
743929,GYPSY400,2012-11-14 10:31:00,191,I put mine up on stands.. Let's the springs rest and I bring my tires indoors so the sun isn't beating on them for 5 months.
743934,Fish4Eyes,2012-11-14 13:08:00,1022,Bought my trailer new approx 4-5 years ago and have not raised it in off season and no issues.
744118,didoban,2012-11-14 22:46:00,65,"My trailer have torsion axles, it goes up in blocks during storage. My other trailer with leaf springs, i just make sure they are properly inflated."
744121,GYPSY400,2012-11-14 22:54:00,191,"I think due to the above responses.. It's a matter of personal preference.. I say, if you have the means and the ambition, put it on stands.. If you don't feel like it, nothing bad will happen.. In the short term anyhow.. I have another boat trailer that I also use as a utility trailer, it never sees stands because it doesn't sit idle long.. And my suspenson and tires are still in good shape My reason for putting my new boat trailer and tent trailer on stands for the winter is more so so I can get the tires out of the sun.. Having the springs with no weight on them is a bonus."
744124,Billy Bob,2012-11-14 22:56:00,5865,It's a good idea to get the tires out of the sun...(mines in the garage)...you could also put covers on them...you see a lot of motor homes with covers on the tires...
744205,Sinker,2012-11-15 03:13:00,8692,"Mine is never stored long enough to put it up on stands. I would miss out on some great opportunities if I actually ""winterized"" my boat.  I just flip up the blind, and throw a tarp over it. I keep the snow cleared around it so I can get at it if I need to get out in it. So far this year, My boat has been in the water every month. I never ""winterized"" it at all. Just kept on using it. As long as the lakes aren't froze over by December, this will be the first time ever i used it all 12 months in 20 yeas of owning it.  S."
744229,mistaredone,2012-11-15 13:04:00,913,Never have but I think I'll start doing it now.
744372,UglyBug,2012-11-15 22:35:00,148,"Nope never, and never a single problem"
