744764,cram,2012-11-17 18:55:00,1733,Catch your own.  It's 5 mins of work.
744765,dave524,2012-11-17 19:01:00,4508," Yep  when dad had the cottage in Haliburton we used a lot that size for pickeral and lakers. We knew all the culverts and bridges on creeks with a good chub population nearby. Rather than trap we found an ultralite with a tiny hook and bit of worm was best, we kept a hardware cloth box floating under the dock and stocked it up when ever we was low."

744773,Snidley,2012-11-17 20:20:00,620,At $3 a minnow I'd dive in and catch them in my teeth.
744774,BillM,2012-11-17 20:22:00,17367," Pretty much, that's insane..  I paid $23 for 2 dozen big sucker minnows last week and I thought that was expensive, lol!"
744775,ketchenany,2012-11-17 20:32:00,3229," The creek on my farm in Cookstown is worth more than the land it runs through! They are in there by the hundreds, never touched except for a muskrat that feeds on them!  They are probably chub, never bother them . . ."
744776,BillM,2012-11-17 20:36:00,17367,"Al, remind me to ask you next year if I can go in and catch a few  :)"
744778,Rich,2012-11-17 21:30:00,3927,"I bought an umbrella net from ctc for 20 bucks. Worth every penny. If i need bait i usually catch small minnows from the creek behind my house, usually salt/freeze them as i know its illegal to transport them live. Works just fine for me, the fish and my paycheck."
744792,buick14,2012-11-18 00:13:00,741,"I understand paying a bit more for hornyhead chub as they last forever....but not $3.  Why don't you think about fishing somewhere with less fish action, like Mimico creek?! That way, you only hafta buy one, and it'll last you the whole trip!!!!!"
744793,G.mech,2012-11-18 00:14:00,830,  Why in the world is it illegal to transport live minnows??  Doesn't say anything about that in the Reg book I read....
744796,kemper,2012-11-18 00:37:00,2232," Pretty easy to transport invasive species from one body of water to another if you're not extremely careful.  I've always trapped my minnows from the same lake that I was fishing in, that way anything I'm tossing into the lake was already there and I don't have to worry about it."
744798,Christopheraaron,2012-11-18 00:46:00,3525," Good practice, but it's not illegal"
744802,Rich,2012-11-18 01:11:00,3927,I was under the impression catching bait in one waterbody and bringing to another was illegal?
744804,northernpike56,2012-11-18 01:20:00,717,I'll use a bug net whenever I am in a creek and can catch them. I also grab frogs and crayfish and stick them on the hook. Great for smallmouth bass and pike.
744805,northernpike56,2012-11-18 01:22:00,717,"  yes another thing I do sometimes is go to a creek in north burlington, and catch 2-3 doz. chubs and sucker minnows. I just freeze them and take out however many I think I'll need for some pike fishing. Nothing illegal about that other than it might look like I am trying to poach brookies."
744811,buick14,2012-11-18 01:38:00,741,"There had been a dirty little bait ban to try to stop the spread of VHS (no not the Punky old video cassette), but I'm not sure if that was enforced/put into play.  If you aren't allowed to transport live forage fish, then what's the use of selling forage fish? Transporting exotic invasives (gobies etc) live is a no go..  I can still remember the days where live crayfish were sold at tackle shops before the spread of those aggressive  rusty gumbos."
744817,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-18 02:03:00,10439,I dip net my years bait during the cisco run here in October. 50 pounds worth in my cooler.    :good: Used a few today out on the ice.      
744835,John Bacon,2012-11-18 04:16:00,3277," It is illegal to transport sport fish, not bait fish. Also, do not release left over bait fish into a new water body; dump your left overs on land. There may also be special regulations about transporting minnows from one zone to another."
744727,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:15:00,4661,Jeeeezus!!!!!  I went to buy 5 inch minnows today... Buddy had like 100 from 4-6 inch... I said I'll take em all... Then I said how much.... He says $3 per minnow!!!!!!!!  So $36 a dozen for 5 inch minnows.... What the heck...  And people wonder why others poach bait...  I'd be willing to pay as much as $1 a minnow.... It's not like they are 12 inch suckers.... 5 inch shinners....  I'm blown away...
744729,outllaw,2012-11-17 14:24:00,1232,that makes the price of gas look feeble wow
744730,dave524,2012-11-17 14:32:00,4508,"Define "" Buddy """
744731,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:33:00,4661,My brother used 2 dozen yesterday.... Luckily he picked em up in calabogy... Or else it would have been $72 for 2 dozen minnows.... That's a pricy day of walleye fishing....  But if I go sene my own minnows its illegal....  Those prices should be illegal...
744732,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:34:00,4661,  Buddy... AKA the guy... AKA a person who's name I'm not gunna post on the Internet...

744735,Live2fish85,2012-11-17 14:42:00,1633,"That is a rip off. We don't charge near that for a dozen 5"" minnows. To bad you live so for away."
744736,Roy,2012-11-17 14:46:00,13728, Why is that?
744737,SlowPoke,2012-11-17 14:47:00,2984,That's offensive. Go down to Big Al's and pick up a couple dozen Nemo's. The walleye won't have any problem finding them.
744739,Roy,2012-11-17 14:53:00,13728,It's perfectly legal to trap your own minnows as long as you're not selling them. You must also have no more than 120 in your possession including any purchased ones.
744740,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:55:00,4661, Dip nets and traps only....   
744741,shane,2012-11-17 14:55:00,652,Gulp.  (Berkly Gulp)
744742,Roy,2012-11-17 14:56:00,13728,"Yeah, that's what I said, ""TRAP""."
744743,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:57:00,4661, I'm a fan of plastics but I don't think they would perform nearly as well as the real thing for this application...
744744,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:59:00,4661, You asked why it was illegal to sene....
744745,SlowPoke,2012-11-17 15:01:00,2984,"At that price for minnow's I'd do a comparison. I love the 5"" Gulp Alive but I've never done a live vs. plastic showdown."
744746,Roy,2012-11-17 15:03:00,13728, Use a dip net in daylight hours or a trap anytime of the day or night. I'm just trying to help you hang onto your house.
744747,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 15:09:00,4661, I know Roy....  I'm just busting your family jewels a bit....
744751,bushart,2012-11-17 16:04:00,2628,3 Bucks per minnow!!!!  I can get Prime Rib on sale for $2.99 a pound  betcha those minnows aint a pound and prime rib tastes better than shiners  catch 3 or 4 12 inch gators on those shiners---and that's gonna hurt  Time to invest in catchin your own bait and tell buddy to blend those babies up into a shiner smoothie
744752,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 16:07:00,4661,  And this guy is a harvester so he's not paying a middle man...
744754,Old Man,2012-11-17 16:36:00,822,"All I can say is WOW!!!  It's $4.50 a dozen for 3"" minnows out here and I think that's outrageous so I trap most of my own. Can't imagine paying $3 a minnow no matter how big they are."
744755,Sinker,2012-11-17 16:37:00,8692,They're not hard to catch......  S.
744758,Bernie,2012-11-17 17:31:00,3190,Jig and worms.
744762,Skipper D,2012-11-17 18:40:00,1970,"Mike i am on it , just waitting for a phone call on a price , if the out come is good i'll pm you shortly on where to pick them up ."
744763,Skipper D,2012-11-17 18:43:00,1970,Mike did you try the bait shop in Inglside ?
