Members of this community have always been helpful with my inquiries, so I figured I will share some photos while I wait for ice to form  The year started off with decent steelhead fishing with the warm temps   Then it finally got cold and I was able to hit the ice     Ice went away and steelhead started again    Love the odd bonus fish! Redhorse sucker.   Spring slabs   Openwater whities   Spring carp     Hit some resident trout     I was taught new techniques for eyes     Summer Bassin'      Fish with teeth    Early fall salmon    Fall slabs   Special fish        Fall steelhead    I'll continue to go steelheading and perhaps try BOQ eyes until the ice is good to go. Bring on the lakers!"
