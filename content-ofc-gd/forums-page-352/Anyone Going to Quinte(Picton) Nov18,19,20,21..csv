742240,RangerGuy,2012-11-05 19:36:00,564,"I've been thinking of chasin the eyes on the 17th... Since I had put my old truck to rest, my wife mentioned we are visiting family that weekend in kingston. So I will be borrow her Grand Vitara to bring the boat out 1 more time before she goes away for the year  I need a new truck ASAP! LOL!"
742242,Pikeslayer,2012-11-05 19:50:00,1443,A bunch of us will be there the weekend after (23-25).  Hopefully the bite turns on for you. And stays on for us  :thumbsup_anim:
742244,Fish Farmer,2012-11-05 20:31:00,2234,"Thanks. I've read posts on a other site, things don't look good right now."
742246,Pickeral eater,2012-11-05 20:33:00,155,Just got back from picton. Spent the weekend there. Marked lots but managed only one pike out front of the cement plant. Heard of a few eyes 9 + lbs but not a lot of numbers. Good luck and looking forward to your post. Bill
744585,Fish Farmer,2012-11-16 17:40:00,2234,"Thanks Bill for the update. I heard things are picking up, a buddy was down for a day trip and caught 7 5LBs. and over."
744596,mike rousseau,2012-11-16 18:57:00,4661,  Anybody hearing of many over 10lbs yet....???
744619,Sinker,2012-11-16 20:53:00,8692,I will be hunting ducks down there mid week. No fishing though.....  S.
744697,Fish Farmer,2012-11-17 03:57:00,2234,"I'll post when I get back Mike with pictures, if I get fish   I'm looking for the big mama for just a picture and she's back to swim another day. We just look for a big length & girth entree for the club. Then the get-together at night"
744724,Moosebunk,2012-11-17 13:34:00,3970,"May go tomorrow for my last trip.  Been out 5 days since Nov5th and it's been great.  Started a report but stuck at work now.  Will pop up something early week I think.  Fish are there, have been there, and are biting.  This week should be great too."
744738,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 14:48:00,4661, I hope you do...  I was asking because I haven't been seeing many reports yet....  I'm pounding nice walleye at home... 10-20 a night with lots of 6-7-8-9 pounders....  So I'm questioning going up to quinte next weekend....
744748,i2cool2fool,2012-11-17 15:25:00,349,"Cool. I am questioning why I haven't started stalking you and fishing in our area.  Sadly, I haven't been out fishing since September."
744749,mike rousseau,2012-11-17 15:34:00,4661,  Lol...  But I'm not getting the 10+ pounders you hear about in quinte....
744750,Roy,2012-11-17 15:56:00,13728,Tybo got a beaut 18 pounder out of Quinte 5 or more years ago. I don't remember if it was a skin mount or a replica he had done but it was by far the largest I've ever seen.
744753,Fish Farmer,2012-11-17 16:11:00,2234,"10-20 a night, ""wholly crap""   Fill me in on your secret. I just want to catch 1, but a big one   You must live near there Mike.  18 Lb'er, I can't even dream one that big Roy  I've been going to Quinte since a kid and I haven't beat my 11. As I say this week it's going to happen  I've had buds in MY boat that have caught 14's"
744809,RangerGuy,2012-11-18 01:32:00,564,"Got a late start today, Just finished a few hours on the bay. 3 hours trolling 0 hits. I marked 8 balls of bait only no hooks.  Got 1 small one casting a jigging spoon.  Great day on the water...."
