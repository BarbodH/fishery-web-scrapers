743996,funfishing,2012-11-14 17:51:00,147,"What kind of reel do you use? If it can stand up to constant carp fishing, it should be pretty well invincible. I'm in the market for a good spinning reel that can take a lot of drag pulling..."
744002,hammercarp,2012-11-14 18:03:00,964,I use a baitcaster. An Abu Garcia Ambassaduer 6000. They are known as well built reels. In the states they are even marketed as carp reels with a custom side plate. 
744007,bare foot wader,2012-11-14 18:26:00,1354," for general purpose spinning, stradics are mint (2500-5000 depending what you're doing with it)  strictly for carp fishing a baitrunner would be ideal"
744010,Beans,2012-11-14 18:45:00,3339, I am green with envy Lorne...Nice catch !!!   
744606,2jack2,2012-11-16 20:08:00,92,Nice fish!
744648,T.Barry,2012-11-16 23:39:00,24,It's not time to fish that spot again is it?  Don't lick your fingers.    Nice Pig Lorne.
744686,hammercarp,2012-11-17 03:13:00,964,How else do I get the carp slime off of them?
