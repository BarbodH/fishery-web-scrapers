743824,captpierre,2012-11-14 00:34:00,2521,"Washed all sorts of lures Sun-Mon at the cottage.  Water temp 45.  Thermocline at 15 ft on sonar.  Caught the big zip.  Trolled for skis 2-2.5 mph 20-30 ft with deep Jakes/Believers.  Trolled 1-1.5 mph for eyes  with deep diving cranks, bottom bouncer and stickbait/worm harness, same depths.  Found a bunch of boats jigging a 50 ft hole with minnows. They were steadily catching eyes but all were 10-12 inches.  Tried trolling deep in that area. Nada.  Thinking there have to be minnows in the area.  No panfish at the dock.  Boat tucked away for the winter.  peter"
743826,BillM,2012-11-14 00:38:00,17367,In the fall I like running big sucker minnows.  Have done well on the eyes and a few big snakes the past 2 weeks on them.

743829,irishfield,2012-11-14 00:41:00,26272,You're trolling too slow (for 'skis)!
743831,captpierre,2012-11-14 00:44:00,2521,I was under the impression that when the water hits these temps we need to back off on speed
743832,captpierre,2012-11-14 00:44:00,2521,Crystal clear line on my HDS 7 at 15-18 ft
743862,tizfun,2012-11-14 01:29:00,292,"We were out on Saturday.. Beautiful day.. Caught about 30 or so walleyes.. Only 4 were in the slot.. most under but managed 2 over the slot..  Latched on to a ski.. fought hard for about 15 mins, never did see it, but a thrill just getting the hit..  This has to be the best year for walleyes and ski's..  Tiz"
743869,Joeytier,2012-11-14 02:12:00,3990,There is no thermocline after turnover...not sure what it was you were marking on the graph???
743921,mike rousseau,2012-11-14 07:35:00,4661, X2  I'd be going 3-3.5 at those temps
743926,Rich,2012-11-14 10:19:00,3927,"Really? Why are people so cocky here? Do you fish for a living? The dude had a bad few days. No need to rub it in there mr izumi. Maybe he doesnt fish pigeon's ridiculously tiny walleyes religiously, so had trouble finding them. Good job though, it takes a certain quality and skill set to twitch a jig covered in live bait.  Wow, that set me off. Time for coffee."
743987,captpierre,2012-11-14 17:32:00,2521, LOL!  Maybe less coffee Rich.  Glad to hear somebody catching on my home lake.  Gotta get my act together  peter
743989,BillM,2012-11-14 17:37:00,17367,"Peter, give some sucker minnows a try.  Fish are on the feed, a big snack is exactly what they are looking for.   I've caught 12in walleyes on 4-5in sucker minnows, not to mention some big snakes!"
743994,John,2012-11-14 17:44:00,2956, Sounds like a long time to have a Muskie on and not to see it............
744126,esoxansteel,2012-11-14 23:00:00,1307,"Books tell you to fish slow, the only thing is Muskies cant read?, if you are not having success with what your doing its time to speed up Musky Mike is pretty accurate on the 3 to 3.5mph, which is where i usually troll this time of the year, but will speed up or slow down if that speed does not produce."
744133,tizfun,2012-11-14 23:23:00,292,"Ok. let's set something clear... My post wasn't put on here to rub anyone's nose in it. We've had a very successful 2 outings in November and 4 miserable outings in October.  Yeah, live bait works well for us. We trolled for skis many times, but seem to have more luck catching while jigging for walleye..  As for not seeing the ski, When you fish with 6 lb mono, wasn't about to start hauling on it.  John, feel free to share your technique ????  Captpierre....  if I offended you in any way, my sincere appologies...  Rich.... You need more friggin coffee..  John.... Still waiting..  Tiz   Jigging for Walleye.... "
744189,captpierre,2012-11-15 01:57:00,2521,No offense taken Tiz.  I've never fished Pigeon in November.  Did well in the summer.  This was the second year on the lake.  Lots to learn.  Glad the fish are there in numbers.  The slots seem to be working
744206,John,2012-11-15 03:14:00,2956,"  Sorry to keep you waiting Tiz.......patience is a virtue..  Lots of Muskies and Northerns caught on walleye tackle. Lot's landed too, just sayin'. I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. Sorry if I offended you..."
744593,jimmer,2012-11-16 18:17:00,2730,"Hey Captpierre I have lived on the lake for years and usually fish elsewhere in October and November. Ever since the zebra mussels moved in, it has been tougher for me in the fall."
744594,ecmilley,2012-11-16 18:40:00,2163,"it sure can be tough in the fall, once you find them it can be non-stop but overall pretty tough for eyes in the kawartha's as for the ski's my best fall days of 4 to 6 fish were trolling walleye speeds on edges 1. 1.5mph never caught a ski doing the fast troll in colder water in my lake yet"
744680,Rich,2012-11-17 02:30:00,3927,Sorry dude... My bad. I need to NOT browse ofc while im on the can in the morn. Lmao
