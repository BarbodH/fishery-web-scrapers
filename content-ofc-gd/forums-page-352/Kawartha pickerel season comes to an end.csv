As my faithful fishing partner looked on, I closed up the season with a skunk...     At least last night I managed a little crappie, but Monday night made up for it with this 27"" fat pig...     The dock is looking pretty lonely, guess it's time to pull it for the winter...     Bring on the ice!  "
