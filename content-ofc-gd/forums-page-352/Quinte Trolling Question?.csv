744053,RangerGuy,2012-11-14 20:09:00,564,What size do you prefer as a fluorocarbon leader from your mainline when trolling cranks?  Is  #10 test fluorocarbon leader heavy enough for the deep diving cranks?
744055,BucktownAngler,2012-11-14 20:12:00,582,i used 15lb seaguar leader material (abrasion resistant)  caught one 8lber and the line was beat up and frayed pretty good.
744067,myot,2012-11-14 20:31:00,131,10lbs is standard for me and I dont think I've ever broke one off  Dan
744085,Guest ----,2012-11-14 21:00:00,0,I've been running 15lb seaguar blue label. Have yet to break off in Quinte in 7 years.
744154,fishindevil,2012-11-15 00:16:00,6254,I as well will use 15lb in quinte but usually will go 10lb anywhere else !!!!
744157,fishindevil,2012-11-15 00:19:00,6254,And I also use 10lb floro for lakers too but for quinte cause I troll and have lots and lots of line out I will bump it too 15lb to handle the additional stretch and of course the big eyes too
744216,mike rousseau,2012-11-15 07:13:00,4661,I use 12lb mono and they don't seem to mind any...
744236,superdad,2012-11-15 13:52:00,353,10 or 12 lbs test - either works - never had a breakoff - Hope I didn't jinx ourselves!!!!!!!  David  aka  Superdad  PS They're coming - they're on their way in..................
744239,Headhunter,2012-11-15 13:57:00,5703,"Well, as I have stated many time in Quinte threads, I run mono or lead core. 20lb mono... I ike the stretch, the elasticity and it's ability to shock absorb with long lines... tends to hold the fish better and not rip out hooks as well as impart action on my lure during a ""Quinte chop""!... imho! HH"
744283,mike rousseau,2012-11-15 16:59:00,4661,Actually got they didn't seem to mind strait 15 pound power pro last time either....
