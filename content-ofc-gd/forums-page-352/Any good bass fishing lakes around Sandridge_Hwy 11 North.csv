743895,audio_mad,2012-11-14 03:15:00,28,"Hey Guys, My wife really got into the idea of buying land or some cheap cottage up North on Hwy 11. I said, I would only buy on a lake with decent fishing. Since I've never fished in that area before(except for Algonquin park), I desperately need your advise on which lakes give good bass fishing perspective around there. Please HELP!!! Thanks in advance,"
743904,Nipfisher,2012-11-14 03:57:00,2449,"How far North? Got a price range? Eagle Lake near South River, Ahmic, Ceecebe Lakes area are nice."
743911,audio_mad,2012-11-14 04:54:00,28,"Price is secondary at this stage and I can go up to 4 hours from North Toronto. Actually, some of the lakes you mentioned I know pretty well (Ahmic and Ceecebe) - they are of 524. I never heard about Eagle lake. Is it any good? That's more or less the area I am looking."
743912,lakemaster,2012-11-14 04:55:00,36,Pickerel lake has a good bass fishing  and its infested with pike and pickerel
744149,audio_mad,2012-11-15 00:03:00,28,What about Bernard lake? Mixed reviews on that one
744150,Rich Nelson,2012-11-15 00:08:00,332,"Restoule and the area lakes have good smallie fishing, and some largies as well..."
744151,Nipfisher,2012-11-15 00:13:00,2449,  Eagle Lake (and Deer Lake) just west of South River. Not too far off of hwy. 11. Google map the area and you will see there are many lakes in the area.    I just searched the area on-line and came across several listings for Bray Lake in that area. Not sure what the fishing is like there but my guess is bass.
744511,audio_mad,2012-11-16 04:43:00,28,Thanks Guys for all the tips! I hope to get as many potential lakes as possible in that area beacuse if I buy something and it's dead fishing wise I am cooked... Thanks a million again for all the replies!
744629,Nipfisher,2012-11-16 21:40:00,2449,"Like I said, PM me with any questions. I have some good buddies that fish alot of those lakes."
744673,captpierre,2012-11-17 01:23:00,2521,"Stay at least 2-3 miles from Hwy 11.  You'd be surprised how far the sound of traffic will carry  If you want peace and quiet, that is."
