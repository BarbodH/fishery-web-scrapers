598718,Joeytier,2011-07-02 14:27:00,3990,"Chad (Rod Caster) invited me to join him in his trusty sportspal for a quick early morning fish on a small lake (and I mean small) not far north of here known for producing some hog walleye.  We were on the road with coffees in hand by 4, and fishing well before 5.  It was quality, and not quantity today.  We both could not believe how hard fighting these walleye were.  These things took drag and peeled off faster than most smallmouth I've ever caught.  Not the best quality photos, but these fish were plump and brilliantly yellow.  Some of the nicest walleye I've ever seen.  I was first up.  Popped this 20.5"" incher on a beetlespin in no more than 5 FOW.    Shortly afterwards, Chad decided to put me to shame and hauled in this beauty 22 incher.  I've honestly never seen a walleye peel drag off like this one.   Chad also managed a nice smallmouth who miraculously landed in my frying pan   It was great to finally get out.  Thanks for having me, Chad."
