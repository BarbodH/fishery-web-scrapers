598733,misfish,2011-07-02 15:31:00,29133,"I have to tell ya,this getting away on weekends sure is great for the soul. 3 weeks ago it was lakair,weekend after was up to pops and this weekend it was another escape to mudder and pops again.Our longweekend started wednesday after work  ,yep,I dont do the traffic thing. This weekend was about helping pop with some concrete sidewalk removal,r&r and fishing.  Spent the morning til noon removing the walk and boy was it getting hot.Time for a cold one and a dip,,,,,,,,,Ya the pool was open,but it was like a polar bear dip at first,but once I got use to it,it was a great cool down. No on else would venture in.  .    Then it was time for that r&r.        After a very nice dinner,it was time for more r&r. This is getting out of hand,,,,,,,,NOT    A late game of euchor,it was night night.  Up in the AM and it was time to load up the boat,wipe all the dew off and head to the lake.  My new boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ok my pops new boat. Another Lund to give me those nightmares in my sleep. They do look like they belong together.    IT,S FISHING TIME  Beauty of a morning.    The catching was second,time out with pop and Betty was the key for the day.          I was mostly jerk and slash baits and spinnerbaits. The action was very slow,so Betty took the time to take some pics of the local wild life from the boat.      Kingfisher I believe.    Was time to try another spot. I was mentioning to pop how the smallies are not bite,n.No sooner say that,wham,smallie on. All I could hear was,get that in,thats going to be breakfast. Those that know me,you want to keep a bass pop,catch yer own.LOL Oh did I tell ya,we forgot the net. Betty wasnt impressed after her weekend encounter with J.  So I get the fish to the boat,reach down and wouldnt ya know it,it got off.  A couple more casts and wham another hit.A hammer handle. They sure beat the crap out of the spinner baits.      After 5 hours in the sun,it was time to head off.  The rest of the day was spent just hang,n out and chill,n. Betty played with the camera. So heres some I thought worth posting. Yea,my cam and she does better then me with it.LOL            Whats in store for next weekend,only time will tell.   HAPPY CANADA DAY WEEKEND OFC"

598969,misfish,2011-07-03 18:59:00,29133," During the first night camp fire Bernie,I was telling pop about you and your garage. How far are you from Katrine?    Is that you talking or the mrs,s.    Truth be told here and not sure I should,working 6 months 24/7 ,and the only tec and maintenance guy in the new plant,I was getting burned out and really feeling like I was about to have a heart attack.(lots of pressure,but I love my job) All my love ones told me I was looking like crap.So I told work to get me help, cause it was time for me to be my old self.Im no good if Im gone right.  The last three weeks have got me there,just ask Betty."
