596997,MJL,2011-06-27 01:03:00,2427,"The last few weeks I’ve been spending some time hunting down giant goldfish. It’s always been one of my most favourite things to do during the summer since I was a kid. Just like with my trout fishing earlier, I also brought along the underwater housing for my camera to take some pics.          Also got some pics of a sweet mirror carp          One writer in the UK who wants to use one of the shots for the cover of his carp fishing book  Some above-water action  I did a couple trips up to the Kawarthas to a few spots I hadn’t fished for a number of years. Fishing wasn’t like I remembered it but it certainly brought back a lot of memories...I love the scenery up there.   A pretty mirror carp...At least to me   Frozen-fire and I spent one morning with our heavier float rods and centrepins chasing carp in a muddy (and buggy) swamp...Got into double header action and I got to test out my bug jacket    No more malaria and West-Nile for me   Being the good friend that I am, I conned Frozen-Fire into getting some new carp gear...But before we hit up the tackle shop, we did some fishing on the way to the store.  Landed 1 fish that broke someone else off...Didn’t escape from me though   2nd mirror carp of the year   Biggest carp so far this season   Can't wait for my next trip out.  Hope you enjoyed"

Just found a cheque in my room I haven't cashed yet...I may spoil myself with even more camera gear   Not too sure which pic he'll use yet. He said the book will be due for publishing in September.  I've got even more pics to choose from though. The last month or so, I've probably taken 8-9,000 pictures.LOL"
