599301,splashhopper,2011-07-04 20:31:00,2931,This past weekend I fished my favourite small inland lake and was ALARMED at how much of the lake was covered in the blue/green algae.  It covered half of the lake .   Is this the kiss of death for this lake?  Can the ministry do anything about this?
599306,landry,2011-07-04 20:39:00,1005,what lake are you reffering to cause I think I fished the same one and was wondering if it was b-g algae. Can u PM me the lake name? Thanks   
599333,scugpg,2011-07-04 21:57:00,1373,"Blame the farm runoff, golf courses and untreated sewage its usually from excess nitrates and phosphorus ie fertilizer."
599337,splashhopper,2011-07-04 22:05:00,2931,2 of the 3 farms surrounding this lake are old order mennonite. Forests surround the lake on all sides. No golf course for 20 miles or so away.
599341,scugpg,2011-07-04 22:11:00,1373,Natural lake or reservoir? It can occur naturally but nutrient loading makes it much worse.
599351,splashhopper,2011-07-04 22:27:00,2931,  reservoir..... old forest is under the back end .... flood control   but the algae is all over the place.  I am wondering if the algae is sucking the oxygen out and depriving the fish..
599382,timmeh,2011-07-04 23:59:00,609,"Many reservoirs have higher nutrient concentrations than natural lakes due to their flooding. Certainly not uncommon to see blue green blooms in many places, and fish survive, so not the kiss of death. But decaying algae can reduced oxygen levels specifically in the bottom layer of water. So it can be a problem and has be related to fish kills but usually doesn't result in mass dieoffs in normal cases. Does seem a little early in the year though, usually a late summer, early fall problem."

599422,scugpg,2011-07-05 01:20:00,1373,I had read a study where they were going to put aerators in Guelph lake to combat this. All of the reservoirs get it down here not sure what one you're at but its pretty typical.
599432,splashhopper,2011-07-05 01:49:00,2931, so if the fish are swimming in it... i shouldn't be touching the fish( if i catch one there)
599436,mercman,2011-07-05 01:57:00,7054,"Only if it is truly B/G algae. There are many types of algae. Check with the local health authorities for sure. Not just farms responsible. Dishwasher soap and laundry detergent are major culprits.They contain huge amounts of phosphates. The Canadian Government is forcing manufacturers of these products to eliminate phosphates in soap.It will mean your clothes will be less bright, and your dishes not as squeeky when they are washed."
