I had thought I read on the site you could rent canoes but I was wrong so I went wade fishing. I switched to another spot and used this year's confidence bait to try and catch another. I hooked something huge and wondered how I was to land a pike wading in 3 feet of water then It hit the surface! a huge largie 19.5"" 3.31lb. A few casts later I caught another nice one 18.5"" about 3lb. Sorry about this one's bad quality it was taken from shore."
