The water is clear and flat we toss in some minnows . we see bass all over but we wanted some perch. So we head out to pottahawk as i was told the perch were out there. got out to pottahawk and didn't find any perch got a pike . So we head back around the point and start looking for bass. the wind had started and the bass were few and far. We did manage to get few odd perch few bass and pike. well it was time to head in I fired up the motor and started then the motor quit ran out of fuel I switched tanks and then tried to start the motor key word is tried it would start run for few min and quit. it wouldn't keep going finally I killed the battery (I think, might be the starter)  So I put a call out for Elevatorman and he came to tow me in"

599149,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-04 03:51:00,10439,Sounds like you had a bit of water in the bottom of the tank. You will need to clear your fuel hose line and drain your carbs as well as getting rid of the water in the bottom of your tank. You will also need to drain the fuel filter. I have seen this happen many times. I just finished disassembling/cleaning and reassembling the 4 carbs on my buddies Yamaha yesterday. He didn't bother taking care of the issue in a timely manner and I had a bunch of gelled fuel and some corrosion to deal with. Make sure in the future that you remember to close the vent on the tank and run fuel stabilizer to prevent this issue in thefuture.  Plus cudos to Elevatorman for bringing you home safe.    :clapping:
