Anyhow, took advantage of the wife watching 2 1/2hrs of Coronation Street this morning and decided to troll home and make sure everything was setup on the boat..  Had a Muskie hit within 15 minutes of trolling over one of my go to spots and man was it nice to feel that girl on the end of my rod!!!  Not a big one but what a way to start the season off!!!  "
