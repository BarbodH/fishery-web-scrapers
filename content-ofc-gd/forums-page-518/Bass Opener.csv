Got 5th place in the Lakeshore Shopper derby with the fish on the left which weighed at 3.84lbs.    These two were caught back to back on a black buzzbait. Don't let the rough water throw off your topwater bite!  Gotta love bass season.  An hour and a half of swimbaiting the other evening on a nearby pond produced this hefty fish too.    Looking forward to stinging some more big jaws!"
