598894,coreyhkh,2011-07-03 03:17:00,163,man this weekend has been hard I caint catch bass at all just walleye and pike. I have also found that out in the weed bed that there is a lack of perch.  Anyone have any tips on where I can find some? Maybe they are still on there beds?

Early morning/late evening fishing might be a good idea.  I've been slamming the largemouth in 5-10ft of water with decent green weed growth in the evenings on Gloucester this year fishing topwater."
