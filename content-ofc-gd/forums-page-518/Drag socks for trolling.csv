598820,vinnimon,2011-07-02 22:52:00,2593,"I have been toying around to slow my troll down a tad and its worked. This is what I have found so far. I have used the plastic eco bags from the barn etc, they do work but they will rip easily. Ok so I seen the bags at homedepot and gave one a shot today Tough as nails so far for a buck No need to cut holes at all, it worked well On a better note it worked best a foot out and a foot in from the stern Better than 80$ a pop."
598829,Meegs,2011-07-02 23:06:00,249,i've used an Ikea bag for years.   work excellent! i have 2 drift socks but half the time i find myself throwing the ikea bag over first!
598837,vinnimon,2011-07-02 23:22:00,2593,"  I find the socks take up valuable space thats needed.Being a newbie to this trolling thing, I find the green hd bags tough enough, esp for a buck a bag.And the metro plastic ones will tear easily and still work."
