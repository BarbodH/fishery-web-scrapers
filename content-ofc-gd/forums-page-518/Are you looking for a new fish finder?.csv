599279,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-04 19:03:00,10439,Got an email this morning from Bass Pro with a huge deal on Humminbird Fishfinder 768 on sale for $199!!! If you're looking don't wait as supplies are limited.
599282,Pikeslayer,2011-07-04 19:13:00,1443," ""originally $499.99"" is somewhat misleading. The ""regular"" price is listed as $299.99.  http://www.basspro.c..._BOEbq5B8cIh6NW  Still a deal I suppose but not quite the ""incredible one time offer"".  .  Just my 199 cents (regularly 499 cents) worth. Slayer"
