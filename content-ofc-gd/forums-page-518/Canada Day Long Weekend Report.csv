Friday I pulled my Grandfathers boat out of the garage and put the for sale sign on her. Thank you again for everyone that gave me an idea of what to sell it for, we went towards the higher suggestions.  I did promise some pics of her      I started her up and she ran like a dream, I even tried to keep it    In less than 24 hours she sold for more than we wanted and it's only going down the street  On to some fishing  Saturday evening I hit the water for an hour or so and caught a few pike    I  was casting into a beautiful blue sky and turned around to see this    It was a lot worse than it looks. I ran wide open back to the boat house watching lightning all around and made it back safe and sound  Sunday morning Jacob wanted to go fishing and I wanted some smallies. Jacob never caught a bass before and managed to catch the 2 biggest of the day. We caught over 25 in 2 hours and it took only 20 minutes to get a limit for my mom's dinner   It was an amazing morning!  Jacobs first bass      He didn't want to hold the big ones. This and a few more were over 17"" and he landed them like a pro! Even was a great net man for me                and the money shot    Later in the day I even got to hang with Skinny for a bit     A busy but very successful weekend that I wish never ended!"
