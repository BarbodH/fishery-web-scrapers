599210,Roy,2011-07-04 13:56:00,13728,"The key here would be...WHAT measured 18""?"
599211,livinisfishin,2011-07-04 13:58:00,661,From the top of the transom bracket to the top of the cavitation plate.
599212,Roy,2011-07-04 14:01:00,13728,This is how it is determined.  http://www.iboats.com/ref/shaft_length.html
599223,livinisfishin,2011-07-04 14:38:00,661,"Thanks roy, everything I've read says short shafts are 15"" but a couple short shaft motors that I've measured are 18"". I've also read that give or take acouple of inches is ok. So hopefully with my 15"" transom an 18"" motor isn't to bad."
599242,Rizzo,2011-07-04 16:21:00,4754,"better than having a 15 inch motor on an 18 inch transom! Should be fine the way it is, if it isn't raise the transon a few inches"
