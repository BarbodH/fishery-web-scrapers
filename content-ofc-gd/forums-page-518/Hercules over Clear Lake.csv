598814,lew,2011-07-02 22:39:00,12766,"I live beside Clear Lake in the Kawarthas and often see Hercules aircraft from Trenton Air Base flying overhead but today they  were MUCH lower than normal and almost seemed as if they were looking for something.  Three different times they flew north to the top end of the lake, then turned around and flew south directly over my place to the south end, then turned north again for another pass. I had the impression maybe they were looking for a missing boat or something but didn't hear anything on the news.  Anyways, I was able to get a few decent pictures from the backyard with my point & shoot for anyone that may be interested.          "
598816,misfish,2011-07-02 22:43:00,29133,"Lew,thier props are not turning,how do they keep them flying?   Very cool pics bud."
598817,lew,2011-07-02 22:49:00,12766," Maybe that's why he was circling Brian, outta gas and looking for a place to land"
598823,Joey,2011-07-02 22:59:00,9122,"That's really cool Lew, they are something to see when they are low and close like that eh!!!  Hope it was just a training exercise and nobody is hurt or missing."
598827,Rod Caster,2011-07-02 23:03:00,5784,"Odd that they would use a Herc for searching, no?? It probably just got repaired again and they took it for a test run.  Nice pics!"
598833,Old Man,2011-07-02 23:16:00,822,Could have been training for low altitude approaches for LAPES operations or any other number of testing or training programs.
598838,Pikeslayer,2011-07-02 23:26:00,1443,Maybe they were trolling for Muskie?
598846,danc,2011-07-03 00:00:00,4677,Cool shots Lew.
598858,JeffBornFishin,2011-07-03 00:36:00,260,Nice pics Lew  That Hercules happens to be a CC130J from 436 Squadron CFB Trenton.  It performed a fly past today at the Portraits of Honour Cermony I was invited to attend today in Peterborough.  My link   This is a brand new machine and it could be heard making circuits in the area until the appropriate time for the fly past.  It carried on afterwards on a training flight.  CF Hercules have flow the Kawarthas/North Hastings for years at low levels for training/practice. They are usually given a landmark etc. and have to pinpoint it for practice. Couldn't believe how quiet the new Hercules is at such a low level.  Was an emotional and moving ceremony and a priveledge to meet Dave Sopha
598907,lew,2011-07-03 10:17:00,12766,Thanks for the explanation Jeff and had I known about the Portraits of Honour tour in P'Boro yesterday I'd have certainly been there too.
598930,Billy Bob,2011-07-03 15:08:00,5865,Nice pics of your Canadian Air Force in training...  It's because of these young men and women that both of our countries are celebrating a long weekend today...
598932,lew,2011-07-03 15:24:00,12766," You got that right Bob and our mission in Afghanistan is now over and thankfully our troops are coming home, starting this week.  Sadly  though, 157 aren't."
598955,mbosh1980,2011-07-03 17:53:00,349,"I Saw that as well as I was out on the lake not catching bass. Glad someone got good shots of it. I only had my old point and shoot, so I got nothing worthwhile."
