I'm pretty darned pleased with myself, never thought i'd ever even give up.   Its been easy some days and a PIG on others.   If anyone out there is considering giving it a go just do it! I cannot comment on any other methods people use to quit, but the patches so far have worked great for me.   I have been playing around with not wearing them in the last week or 2 and can get by without them...but they do help. I definitely would suggest not wearing them at night....in fact i take mine off a good 3 hours before bedtime....i just use them for the first part of the day most days.   Anyway....its early days yet....but i'm liking not being a smoker....hating the cravings and crabbiness though.  I did have one really great experience last week. I was heading out for an early morning fish in the boat....the rush of air i could actually breathe in when i opened up the throttle on the tiller was awesome...not been able to breathe that clearly for 30 years!!!"
