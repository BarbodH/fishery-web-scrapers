There's this neice whom I promised to take fishing 2 years back. She's 5 now and didn't forget. The Princess rod was sitting on the kitchen table waiting to be rigged. So off to the local park we go. Lots of rockies, but not too cooperative. Tessie got to see the fish hound in action. Caught her first fish too. Just need the one pic to tell it all. "
