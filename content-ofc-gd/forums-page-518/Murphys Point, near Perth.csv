Has anyone fished here and could give me some information on species and tactics.  The drive up is about 4 and a half hours from where I live so I really want to make it worth the journey.  Cheers and thanks for any help."

599052,muskymike,2011-07-04 00:18:00,772,"Just drove thru it on Friday. I live just down the road. Nice park. Lake looks very promising. Not sure where to go or what to fish for but I have heard good things. Hopefully someone else from the area can help you out.  PS. It wont take you 4 1/2 hours from Woodbridge. As long as you can get through the Yorkdale-115 stretch with decent traffic, it shouldnt take you more then 3 to a max 3.5 hours. I drive to Stoney Creek/Hamilton all the time and its only 3.5 hours."
