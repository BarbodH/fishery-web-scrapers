595393,GreenCanada,2011-06-22 16:19:00,375,"Beautiful rod, which I'm sure will see many pickerel in the coming days, weeks, months, and years. Way to go!"
595427,Harrison,2011-06-22 17:47:00,2202,WOOO HOOO.. thats awesome!!!!!

595465,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-22 20:27:00,1107,ci4 would be really nice would make a real light combo.
595535,pikeguy,2011-06-22 23:12:00,195,If Jen does not want to go can i come lol But would it take to get her to go with you how about a challenge? Think that would help? Most girls that are active out doors are competitive.
595536,irishfield,2011-06-22 23:28:00,26272,"No need to push her G, she's already bought her return train ticket for Monday departure/Friday return. Union Station to Temagami. Want's to climb to the top of the tower before her surgery on the 6th of July. Guess that means I have to climb all them steps as well..."
595540,pikeguy,2011-06-22 23:44:00,195,Guess that means I have to climb all them steps as well...   sound like a work out glad she decided to go
595544,irishfield,2011-06-23 00:07:00,26272,  Thought you were ordering a beer!! Just looked that up... $750 US +/- from the USA. Not gonna happen..
595564,danbouck,2011-06-23 01:00:00,4380, Lol
595842,irishfield,2011-06-23 20:03:00,26272,"My local lad at Backwater has nadda in stock, but Trombly's Tackle in Orillia has a pair of STCI42500f's in stock so I'm hitting there on the way North in the am. If Jen can have a shinny new rod and reel I'm gonna toast that $39 cardinal I'm using on my (1982 Berkley Lightning) Pikeral rod. That'll be the first $500 gone this trip!"
595844,fishnsled,2011-06-23 20:16:00,3520,  A very good choice I'd say for that rod.  We just need some pics with a fish or 2 now and the owner of that combo.  Oh don't forget the line and a jig or 2
595869,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-23 21:19:00,1107,Good deal Wayne she will love the CI4
595870,lakerguy,2011-06-23 21:26:00,224,I dont post too often on here but I sure do read almost every thread.  Just wanted to say that this one sure hit home...  Thats a pretty darn nice way to say we are thinking about you and giving best wishes to folks with health issues.   Someday I will try and spend a little less time on our family farm and alot  more time tryin to go fishin with some of the great people on this site.  Cheers
599469,irishfield,2011-07-05 04:11:00,26272,"I gotta tell you, with the CI4 on there it's the lightest and most well balanced fishing stick I've Jen's ever used !!!  THANKS again guys for bringing the smiles and the tears. Jen stuck out the rain for a good 3 hours, but we couldn't hook her up with anything. A common theme I'm hearing from the lake last week.   "
599514,John,2011-07-05 11:52:00,2956," Great pics Wayne, thanks for sharing. That's a great reel, compliments a Spiel special ""reel"" well!"
599518,Spiel,2011-07-05 11:59:00,9065,"Great pictures Wayne, I'm pleased to hear you Jen liked it. The smile alone is worth it for me.  Prayers and best wishes to you all, tomorrow!"
594887,irishfield,2011-06-21 01:32:00,26272,"From the bottom of our hearts Chris.... thanks for the thought(s) and hard work to put this wonderful one piece spinning rod together, and to John for donating the St Croix blank for the build!  You can see in the first picture just how Leah felt about it, that's for sure! And the second and third pics show the ""customization"".        Thoughts and generosity of many here on OFC have helped us down this road and this weekend added the icing on the cake.  Despite having a son, Jennifer and Kristal have been my main fishing partners since they were able to walk. She'll get MANY years of enjoyment out of this PICKERAL rod !!  I'm sure glad that last minute we decided to hit Lakair for a few days of R n R.. ""to forget about life for awhile""! Wayne and Leah."
594888,Whopper,2011-06-21 01:35:00,2174,Way to cool
594889,muskymike,2011-06-21 01:35:00,772,Awesome guys. Well done all around!!! Once again this board keeps on surprising.
594895,GBW,2011-06-21 01:44:00,8460,very cool!
594902,mercman,2011-06-21 02:03:00,7054,"Chris !! You are one class act. And John, a very generous human being. I have seen a few of your rods at Roys, and they are works of art Chris. The heart of the this community is overwhelming, and humbling indeed.  You Rock   Paul"
594922,corvette1,2011-06-21 02:40:00,1765,awesome guys
594925,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-21 02:46:00,4399,Very cool!!! Great bunch here for sure!!!
594931,danc,2011-06-21 02:56:00,4677,Pretty cool....
594936,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-21 03:28:00,1107,
594937,irishfield,2011-06-21 03:31:00,26272,"I should add... I'm looking thru my collection for a reel to put on it or I may have to run out and buy the perfect match.  Trying to get Jennifer to come to Temagami with us for about 10 days of R n R, starting Thursday. Her surgery is scheduled for Wednesday July 6th and she'll be in the hospital until well into August at minimum."
594963,Handlebarz,2011-06-21 09:45:00,3790,What a great job there Chris .  I hope that she will come with you guys to the camp Wayne it sure would be nice just to have that relax time to clear the minds a bit.
595003,TJQ,2011-06-21 13:16:00,7806,"That is a wonderful PICKERAL rod, Speil is a wonderful craftsman!!"
595007,misfish,2011-06-21 13:29:00,29133,"Yep he,s 1st class all the way.  I agree,nice walleye rod forsure."
595018,bigbuck,2011-06-21 13:57:00,2449,"Spiel, that was incredible of you!! Wayne is a bigtime contributor to the board and has helped out quite a few OFNrs over the years and it is good to see that some of the Karma he has built up over the years is coming back to him by this gesture. Wayne, get your little girl healthy again and get her out to give this rod a test drive. It needs a nice brand spanking new reel."
595024,PainInTheBass,2011-06-21 14:08:00,102,That is wonderful.  You guys exemplify the word community.
595025,Roy,2011-06-21 14:13:00,13728, I agree. And John is a wonderful enabler.
595032,fishnsled,2011-06-21 14:43:00,3520,"Just awesome what people do around here, very cool!! WTG Spiel and John!!  A break well needed Wayne and Leah, nice to see you having a bit of R n R."
595037,solopaddler,2011-06-21 14:58:00,8605,"Very nice gesture guys, well done."
595040,Terry,2011-06-21 15:07:00,14456,very nice guys
595056,Spiel,2011-06-21 15:57:00,9065,"Thanks everyone, I hope it brings as much happiness to Jen as it did for me working through the process. Wayne assured me that Jen was an avid fishergirl and that this gift would undoubtedly bring a smile to her face, Lord know she deserves it.  To quote your own words Wayne ""Karma... it is a three way street correct?,"" it is and I'm happy to be in a position to return the kindness!  And you're correct Roy, John is an enabler, thanks again John!"
595058,John,2011-06-21 16:11:00,2956,Thank you all for the kind words but Chris is the one who took the very generous initiative and thoughtfullness and ran with it. I just happened to have a blank that worked for what he had in mind is all.
595090,irishfield,2011-06-21 18:42:00,26272,"Both of you are way toooo modest, but I got to see the ""twinkles"" in your eyes personally... and that made the drive to Lakair more than worth the effort, even if we'd just turned around after that exchange and drove right back home!  So I'm gonna stop at Trombleys, in Orillia, on our way North. What's the suggested reel for this beauty ??"
595098,John,2011-06-21 19:15:00,2956, Stradic 1000 series or if you are a little more budget minded maybe Sahara 1000?
595343,Leecher,2011-06-22 14:44:00,7832,That's awesome Wayne Kudos to Spiel and John
595345,bigbuck,2011-06-22 14:49:00,2449,2500 Stradic all the way.
