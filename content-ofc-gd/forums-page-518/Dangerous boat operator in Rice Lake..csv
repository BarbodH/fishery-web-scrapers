598016,Raf,2011-06-29 17:52:00,3495," i agree.. there are spots you simply cannot fish in the day or in the summer due to the heavy boat traffic - that's just the way it is.  you cannot expect people to get off plane on a marked channel because you are there fishing, tied up to the buoy (which is illegal btw).  first and foremost, it's a throughfare. common sense goes both ways. there are lots of other places to fish."
598022,Harrison,2011-06-29 18:01:00,2202," Fine line Brian, I hear ya though.   Ummhmmm.    There are arses in every walk of life."
598039,RyanT,2011-06-29 19:44:00,72,"   No... it's wrong.  You are wrong.  Depending of course upon how close you really are to them... but I think if you're saying, ""blast through"" them it must be damn close.  Maybe they shouldn't be anchored there if it's a small channel... but they are, you can't just blast through and put their lives in danger just because you think you have the right to blast through because there's no speed limit.  The callousness that you'll put someone else's life at risk is shocking and unacceptable."
598050,misfish,2011-06-29 20:28:00,29133," Thier not right beside me, if thats what your thinking.Also, like said,they know it,s a busy pass through,why fish it and put themselves at risk. It,s not just blasting through. Large crusiers go through it and make much more of a wake then a bass boat does .Thier pushing alot of water away. Go on Sparrow and see what it,s like.  Wrong? IYO Yes,but like I said,,,,,,,,   Im not saying it,s right that we blast through,but it,s not wrong."
598051,OutdoorDan,2011-06-29 20:36:00,325,"Where my boat is you have to travel quite a while through a very narrow channel to get out into the open water. It gets busy, especially on weekends. Mostly people fish on the outside of the channel, but sometimes people fish the channel itself. This is extremely annoying and shows a lack of common sense. It's like playing street hockey on Queen street - you just don't."
598239,F_ast,2011-06-30 11:34:00,154,"That is just it though... It is wrong.  Pick up a boaters hand guide dude.  Anchored fisherman have the right of way.  Fisherman that are not in operation of their powered engine have the right of way.  Same as canoers, sailboats and swimmers.  If your actions were seen by an OPP, you would be ticketed I am sure.  Channel or not.  If there were people in a canoe paddling in the channel, do you blast within feet of them too? ... Well, after reading some of the OPP stories on here maybe not.  You are still in the wrong.  Channel or not."
598261,hirk,2011-06-30 13:15:00,571,"Right of way? my friend 1st and foremost it is illegal to anchor in a navagation channel and impede marine traffic so he would be the one getting the ticket.The guys orignally posted about are not likely fishing a bass tournament because there are 3 of them in the boat.Reminds me of the guy that droped a bow and stern anchor in the middle of the nav channel openning to the Otonabee and sat sideways in a channel that's about 60' wide,every cruiser had to come off plane to get around him,they only reason the dumb==s's didn't get soaked by my rooster tail was they had a teenager in the boat.Did I run past him doing 50mph,yup,was I indangering them,not at all,virtually no wake,did they clue in and pull the anchors?nope sat there for hours,they deserved to get soaked and if anyone was contributing to a potentially dangerous situation it was they themselves,they say you can't fix or legislate stupid."
598293,F_ast,2011-06-30 15:12:00,154,"Think of it as a pedestrian on the street, ya, they should not be there, but doesn't mean you can ""run them off the road"".  As a boater, you need to be in compete control of your craft.  Even in control of your craft, if rolling at 60mph the guy in the anchors boat gets nervous fires up and just happens to go the wrong way... then what?  The fact that most people these days simply are not courteous to others on the water is just blatantly obvious."
598360,RyanT,2011-06-30 20:17:00,72,"   It's hard to really judge from a post what exactly everyone means by 'close' on the water.  People shouldn't be fishing in designated navigation channels.  If it's just a narrow section of a river though then boaters have to slow down and respect the anchored boat.  It's always best to stay further away anyways on the water.  I have a place on the Ottawa River and am always seeing big cruisers pass each other within 20-30 yards on an otherwise deserted stretch of water... almost like they don't want to bother turning the wheel a hair and slightly detour.  Kind of like, ""I'm not moving... he can move!""    "
598363,canadadude,2011-06-30 21:00:00,769,"It really dosn't matter who is in the right or wrong....it's all about having alittle repect for everyone on the water. Sometimes I may be fishing a drop off on the channel and boats may be all over me, but show some respect and most do, I must say and friendly wave is given, not very often a boat blasts by me they are ussually very respectfull, I fished the Karwathaw  lakes and yes alot of boat traffic but most are very polite. There are a few.....but I; ve got nothing good things to say about the kawartha's"
598373,jedimaster,2011-06-30 21:55:00,3472,"Sometimes in a situation 2 people can both be wrong. A boater can be held responsible for the damage there wake causes. As well you're not supposed to anchor yourself to a navigational bouy. I would be willing to bet a shiny dollar bill tht if some guy was achored illegally, and someone swamped him and killed him. The guy doing the swamping would get charged."
598374,Tybo,2011-06-30 22:04:00,1373,"Jedi,Charged yes.Convicted no."
598376,jedimaster,2011-06-30 22:07:00,3472,"true enough... witht he way te laws are I am surprised anyone gets convited of anything other than te mot basic and clear ct laws, like forgetting your operators card in your vehicle."
599207,F_ast,2011-07-04 13:40:00,154,Jail time for sure.
596979,bigbuck,2011-06-27 00:17:00,2449,  You should have got his licence # and gone to where they do their weigh ins and had a talk with him and the tourney director. He should know better. Jack
597105,Garnet,2011-06-27 10:50:00,2056,Haven't seen you in bit Farmer. When the last time you stop in the middle lane of 401 to eat your DQ and have some family time?  Most likely at the Orillia Perch Festival there was a bunch of small boats and the cop needs to no better. Most of these cops are just on for the summer took the course and are basically stupid. Next time name and badge and call there staff sargent.  Jer reading your post....... and I'm guessing. You sat somewhere close and watched this pro catch some fish. What you should have done is looked around and said that looks like that and off you go smarter and a better angler.  What the pro did wrong was leave something nobody's right.
597109,Jer,2011-06-27 11:08:00,1426,"  You shouldn't make assumptions...they make an   out of you and me.  I don't really care where the pros fish, I can find my own spots. I live on the lake, fish it almost everyday, and know it better than most of the pros.  If you read more carefully, you'll see we were fishing the spot long before this dimwad came through at full speed. He wasn't upset we were fishing ""his"" spot, apparently we were just in his way on his own private water speedway. It would have been no different if we were broken down there and adrift. He just wasn't looking where he was going at 60 mph."
597113,Jer,2011-06-27 11:20:00,1426,"  The thought did occur to us, but I don't even know where the tourney was based from, and we didn't get his info. Next time I'll have a camera ready.  I understand that stuff happens, a simple ""sorry guys, didn't see you there"" would have sufficed. It was the attitude that pissed me off, like we were at fault."
597196,Sinker,2011-06-27 15:21:00,8692,"I had an OPP boat pretty near capsize me when they approached from up wind, and drifted right into my port side. The girl driving was a total dipstick, I was pissed!! They didn't even check my gear they were so embarrased. I told them to always approach from downwind from now on, and don't get so damn close!!! If I wasn't anchored I would have stayed well clear, but with 100ft of rope out I couldn't get out of the way in time.  If your in a small boat, stay away from the main channels. A lot of people will run between you and a marker buoy, no matter how much space there is to go around. I know the same thing happens in Bewdley as well. I wouldn't fish in front of town, just for that reason. I think Rice lake attracts more idiots than most other lakes to be honest. Between the hundreds of boat rentals, and the rest of the citiots that show up there, I'm surprised there isn't more people killed on that lake!!  S."
597216,doubleheader,2011-06-27 16:02:00,497," This kind of thing is happening all over the place. It's a sign of the times and the ""me first"" attitude of so many people."
597444,Grimace,2011-06-28 02:17:00,2020,I love how everyone blames Toronto Crazies.  I am not from the city but always get a chuckle from people who blame things on people that they do not know and assume that they are something that they do know.  Those guys could have been from Tillsonburg for all anyone knows.  Damn Tillsonburg crazies.  They have never been the same since the tobacco industry gave way to soy bean.  Weirdos.
597457,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-28 02:53:00,1107,HEY  I'm right here LOL

597490,Sinker,2011-06-28 04:26:00,8692,"Well Grimace, if you lived around here, you would understand how things change on a weekend. Crazy drivers on the roads, and on the water. Its not like that from sept till june, but june till end of august is nuts with ""vacationers"". (I hope that's a better term for you) I prefer citiots myself.  S."
597503,solopaddler,2011-06-28 09:45:00,8605,"Interesting thread, I've learned a couple things.  No one's exempt from stupid behaviour on the water including the OPP.  And it seems that some tournament anglers believe their rights on the water are more important than everyone elses.  Why am I not surprised."
597516,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-28 10:52:00,1107,Not very many have this out of my way attitude but some do I find pleasure boaters are far worse for crowding and passing at high speed.
597540,Harrison,2011-06-28 12:31:00,2202,"If you are fishing a certain mouth of a River on Rice then you are in the war zone.  It's par for the course fishing that water unfortunately.  I've been buzzed there many times by bassboats, tinnies with 9.99's, bayliners, sea doos, and once by a tough guy in a canoe, I could atleast give him an earful though."
597581,Grimace,2011-06-28 13:55:00,2020," I do not doubt for a minute that there is some truth to it, perhaps a lot of truth to it, but when you see a jerk on the water or road and mutter to yourself 'citiot' you are perpetuating that stereotype and confirming it in your own mind without ever knowing if you are correct.  Same goes for an out of towner who assumes he just got buzzed by a local who doesn't want him on 'his' lake.  I do know one thing, that is the Kawartha region would have a much different economic climate without 'citiots' visiting every weekend."
597779,OutdoorDan,2011-06-28 23:31:00,325,"People immediately start blaming things on citiots, where in actuality most people doing these things are likely those with a lot of experience on the water and attitudes akin to those of some taxi drivers that think they own the road."

597809,misfish,2011-06-29 01:06:00,29133,"Guilty here,BUT.   Fishing a lake that has bouys to guide you straight through a channel, with no speed limit and trying to get to your spot before any other,and theres boats anchored beside the channel,you anchored boaters,take your chances.  Im not saying it,s right that we blast through,but it,s not wrong."
597814,cram,2011-06-29 01:24:00,1733,Hard to believe people put others safety at risk for a fishing tournament.  Some of you guys need to check your priorities.
597817,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-29 01:35:00,1107,I can't speak for all tourney guys but my tourney partner and I always give lots of space when passing other boats that are anchored or slower and slow down when we can't give room and we always get waked almost got sunk on the st clair river last year by a 30+' cruiser .  BTW Tillson Burgs a beautiful little town to live in ya jerks LOL

598008,jimmer,2011-06-29 17:39:00,2730,"They aren't actually tournament pros Jer. They can afford to buy a big bass boat and truck to tow it, then call themselves tournament pros! Those things can be killing machines in an inexperienced operator's hands. They go to marina buy the boat, stick it in the water, and off they go without any training. It happens to me weekly out on Pigeon and it's so dangerous. However, thank God for the Boaters Card. They know what they're doing!"

The following photo was taken very shortly after the boat zipped by our boat in full speed.   We had our boat anchored and were fishing in the same location for at least 30 minutes. The boat above finished their drift and decided to put their boat into full speed, went pass us within a boat length. Right before they closed in, I yelled at them, telling them to be careful.  Just like jerks around the world, they all turned their heads away from us.  The white line in the following photo was the path of that ""wonderful"" boater.   They went by so fast and close that the wake that boat made combine with the normal wave action almost flooded our boat.  Please don't be a jerk our in the lake.  You can kill someone..."

I just use the eletric to turn into the wake rather then take it into the side of the boat. some A holes have no clue that is a dumb arsed thing to do. Im not even kidding on how many times this happens to me out there..
596650,Terry,2011-06-25 21:11:00,14456,lots of people out there like that
596651,skeeter,2011-06-25 21:11:00,1907,Too bad you didnt cast your lure at them then set the hook hard.

We were drifting between two islands when one boat was coming up behind us, as they slowed to pass, another bass boat came flying around the point of the island at full speed headed right for us. I was seconds from jumping from my boat. He came off plane no more than 10 yards off my bow and then had the balls to give us crap for fishing in that spot, don't really know what that was all about. We told him to slow down and watch where he was going and he took again in a huff."
596821,Garnet,2011-06-26 12:29:00,2056,It goes both ways.  It's real common to see anchored boats in the boat channel and even tied to marker buoys. And most boats create less wake at speed than stopping.  Nobody's right just a little respect.
596824,Jer,2011-06-26 12:41:00,1426,"  We were at least a mile from the nearest channel marker and if the guy hadn't stopped, he would have T-boned us. I don't think he saw us at all until the last second..."

So I said, so it's OK to kill some poor kid just because you have the right of way. OH man was I mad!!! This derby is only for a few weeks brings big money to Orillia. Have a little sense.

I seldom hit the lakes at this time of the year, but definately compare it to some of the folks I meet on streams in the fall. No consideration or care for the rest of the folks on the pool, or hole. It's all about wanting to fish where 'they want'. They have been thinking about catching fish for the last couple of weeks, and don't give a crap for anybody else. Compare it to the creep who cuts you off on the 401, so he can get a couple of car lengths ahead of you, when all the rest are creeping forward, and just wanting to get home.  You see them all the time!"
