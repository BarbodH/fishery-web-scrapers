599022,scugpg,2011-07-03 22:45:00,1373,I just notice that my starter battery is going on 6yrs. I checked the fluid yesterday and it was slightly low so I topped it up with distilled water. I was wondering if I'm on borrowed time though and should be looking at getting a new battery as its quite old. What do you guys think?
599026,SBCregal,2011-07-03 22:50:00,688,you could take it out and go to canadian tire or any other shop and have it load tested.  most places do it for free and the ones that charge for it are quite reasonable.  way better than finding out too late out on the water

599073,scugpg,2011-07-04 01:08:00,1373,Thanks guys I'll get it load tested to be sure. Seems to be fine so far.
