Myself, my girlfriend and a friend from work grabbed 2 dozen nightcrawlers after work a couple days ago and decided to pound some sheepies. Lots of bites, small fish and gobies but we all managed a decent one before the night was done. What a fight on 6lb test. If you don't like sheephead, you're nuts!        And on another note, this random daytime raccoon showed up to snack on a dead carp then climb a tree to sleep. lol    Good times! Summer rules."

599252,craigdritchie,2011-07-04 16:49:00,1586,Sheepies will whack crankbaits at this time of year. That's always fun to hit the water after work and catch a few of them on Shad Raps or Wally Divers. They fight pretty well.

599452,ehg,2011-07-05 02:48:00,2666,"Yup, catching any fish that is scrappy is all the fun.  When fishing the outflow in winter, could always tell a drum by its constant digging for the bottom. Would always bend the rod right over while it dove down. Most other fish would fight near the surface.  Nice going on the report."
