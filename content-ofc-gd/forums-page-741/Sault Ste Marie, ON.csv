421481,Pope29,2010-01-12 04:23:00,29, I've never been able to figure Rock out. I've done well all over that system but that lake always is tough on me.
421488,foggynotions,2010-01-12 05:37:00,21," I've fished Huff, but not during hard water season, although I would like to try it out this winter for sure.  Quemenico I have never fished and yes Luc does need a sled!"
418756,foggynotions,2010-01-05 03:25:00,21,"I posted this in another thread, but I figure I would post it in its own thread and anyone in the area can add to it as the hardwater season progresses!

419873,archie_james_c,2010-01-08 03:40:00,618, Im in
419886,bigugli,2010-01-08 04:00:00,6138,That's because I've been too busy crying in my beer. Loved the Sault area when I was younger. Haven't been back in 25 years.
419895,redneck666,2010-01-08 04:16:00,563," no kidding eh? i just moved back here 3 years ago after being away in oshawa and bowmanville for 12 or 13 years. i dont really think a whole lot has changed, besides the good ol' trails and where you can fish."
421299,foggynotions,2010-01-11 22:34:00,21,"Three new lakes to report  South Anvil Lake - 15-16"" solid good ice, very windswept no slush North Anvil Lake - 15-16"" solid good ice, very windswept no slush no slush Mystery Lake - 15-16"" solid good ice, very windswept no slush no slush  On a side note, - For those of you that know the Anvil's the beaver dam area was pretty solid and the trail around is a bit sketchy because of a lack of snow - Saymo Lake where you enter the swamp was also solid, we broke trail up and onto the domtar road (which is awesome, snowy and not plowed)"
421326,pike slayer,2010-01-11 23:20:00,1177,right on ssmfishingguy!! i wouldnt be worried about going anywhere now. just look out for river mouths and current. lakes are solid and enough snow for a sled!
421329,archie_james_c,2010-01-11 23:27:00,618,  Ask Dr. Sal if theres a lake or two with not enough ice on it
421333,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-11 23:37:00,0,ice is never totally safe! there was lots of ice 2 feet away from where my foot went through.
421396,Eazy,2010-01-12 01:12:00,260,"Went out yesterday, up 67 road, about 8"" of solid ice!"
421406,foggynotions,2010-01-12 01:31:00,21, Huff? Queminico?
421409,archie_james_c,2010-01-12 01:34:00,618,"  Round...don't ask  how we did    LOL.  PS, did you get my PM?"
421425,pike slayer,2010-01-12 01:57:00,1177,"those are the ones we probably should have been going to. have u tried them? im now interested in trying them out. pm me if you like. and dr. sal you need a sled, just dont stop till you hit land haha"
