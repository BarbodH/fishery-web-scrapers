Fishing was slooooooooow but I managed to pull out a 15"" Brookie and a little minnow of a Laker also had my worm stripped in the same hole I caught the speck in. The speck was caught on a small eagle claw treble hook with a worm and no weight...just let it sink to the bottom and slither around   . The Laker was caught on my trusted Williams Whitefish in gold/silver hammered.  My rant as it is, is about my Canadian Tire Gerber folding bone/wood saw seen here...http://www.gerbergear.com/index.php/product/id/83  Well after cutting half way through a dead 4"" Cedar all i hear is ""SNAP"", and watch as the blade blows apart...well thats no good I figure, so I had to use the bone blade for the rest of the day, and that didn't make me too happy. I have a video to follow it up. EDIT- Video here...**WARNING** I say the F word not once, but twice     Heres the Speck next to a 6"" bladed Buck Knife.   Like I said in a previous post, cowboy coffee looking out on the lake   My partner all ambitious to get some poisson. "

421947,johnnyb,2010-01-13 17:52:00,3413,"I have had those folding saws blow apart as well...would have thought a Gerber product would stand up though.  I don't know the name of my saw...paid $30 for it at Hiker's Haven...turns into a mean-ass looking hacksaw, and all comes apart to store inside one long tubular handle.  Kind of like the coghlan's, just with a beefier handle.  I found a pic of it...or a very good knockoff...the thing has never let me down, and cuts through anything.  Super lightweight and takes up no next to zero space.Trailblazer TakeDown bucksaw"
