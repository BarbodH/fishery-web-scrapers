I have no clue about the lake depths or baits to use there.. any tips would help.. please and thanks in advance!"
422053,vinnimon,2010-01-13 23:14:00,2593,"There are pike in there, some big ones too.Lost a monster last year.They also sell minnows in the park at the parking lot,give them a call or google it."
422057,dnb_cbr,2010-01-13 23:19:00,61,"Perch, sunfish, pike(.5-1.5lb avg), largemouth, crappie.  There are no walleye in the lake.  Its very shallow, averages about 5', and is very clear.  There is a deeper hole near the back end that gets about 22'.  Small spoons would probably be a good bet for pike, they sell live bait, but call ahead to see if they have small or large minnows.  Google ""island lake orangeville"" Lots of info."

The lake isnt very deep  with depths of 22 ft...    most people fish in 6-9 ft of water  The CRV have huts and its very resonable..     Dont expect to catch tons like you do on Simcoe perch,  but a fun time none the less  Dave"
