422069,dave524,2010-01-13 23:53:00,4508," Very nice, good open layout at the back, obviously designed for salmon fishermen by salmon fishermen. Good weather protection, my favourite in its class for great lakes trolling."
422084,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-14 00:39:00,3761,"Wow, definitely my most responsive and active threads ever. Lot's of great boats and pictures everybody! Really loved to see so much reply's...like over 100!!!"

422249,anders,2010-01-14 14:36:00,1168," Nice boat!  My brother and i have liked them for a long time, but have heard some rumours about them, like being an all 1 piece hull, there have been tendencies for cracks to occur around the edges or seams.  Like its not forgiving in rough waves and the boat takes a beating, (and im not talking going over 6 footers and full throttle, just plain wear and tear)....i dont know if what i am saying is coming across right or not...haha.  Have you heard or seen anything like that with yours or any others?"
422274,tonyb,2010-01-14 16:09:00,1637," Yes...so quiet, clean, refined, powerful and reliable...exactly what an outboard should be!  It's a very stealthy engine, so much so, that I won't use my 9.9HP pro kicker in shallow water trolling...it's all about noise under the water I am aware, but I just can't help myself.  I feel like a trolling ninja! when running the Verado    Verado also translates to 'Lucky' in latin apparently  Tony"

422307,Spiel,2010-01-14 18:34:00,9065," All in good time Mike. I think the most common denominator here with the folks who have posted there beautiful boats is that most are not young fellows like yourself. I'd also be willing to bet that most have owned a number of smaller tinnies and such before getting their dream boats.  Personally I've been through a number of boats and it all started with a 16' Sportspal. And gosh darn it I wish I still had it.  You'll get your boat one day, as they say, ""good things come to those that wait"", supposedly."
422314,tonyb,2010-01-14 18:55:00,1637,"  Yes good eye Spiel.  Bronte holds a special place in my heart too...I grew up fishing the area from when I was a kid riding my bike there through to today with my boat.  I remember one time I rode my bike there when I was a kid and the O.P.P. kicked me off the pier for not having a fishing license, saying I had to be with someone over 18 who had a valid one(of course they were wrong and I argued with them but to no avail)...  I remember crying about it as I left and rode my bike home all sad.  When I got home my mom, god bless her, was so fumed she called the Burlington Post and of course they ran a story on it with me frowning on the cover page holding my fishing rod...  Tony"
422316,Roy,2010-01-14 18:56:00,13728,Here's my tinny.....I even have the dog up front.    
422335,lew,2010-01-14 20:25:00,12766," Ya got that right Spiel, my 1st boat, waaaaaaaaaaaaay back in the day, was a 6' wooden punt with a 3 HP motor, but boy, did me & my bro, eddyk, ever have some great times in her"
422392,F7Firecat,2010-01-14 23:24:00,347," Yes I love my Vrod also.  The thing trolls like a dream, I'm not even considering a kicker, just run the Vrod!"

420909,GeorgeJ,2010-01-11 00:33:00,207,"Here's my Tracker Grizzly 14', only had it one season so far and am pretty happy with it. "
420915,dave524,2010-01-11 00:50:00,4508," Your're going to love that boat when it's done. I ran its cousin a 18' Sylvan CC , 90 hp and a 9.9 kicker for the better part of 20 years on Lake Ontario for salmon and Erie for walleye and bass. Was hard to chose between the two when I was buying, Starcraft had the nicer console but the Sylvan had a built in 18 gal tank, looks like you got the best of both now. Good deep hulls for the big lake and easy to move around in. Looks like you are doing a great job on the refurbishing, nice rig."
420923,corvette1,2010-01-11 01:08:00,1765,      Here is my 1800 pro-v......
420926,SlowPoke,2010-01-11 01:11:00,2984," Thanks Dave. I've had it a few years now and its been good to me apart from an electrical/motor problem incurred from helping someone start their plane. I have a 75 on it; good for 34mph loaded or empty. A 90 would be nicer Since you're familier with the boat you probably know where the old casting deck ends (ahead of the new tank), the new deck will be two feet longer (behind the new tank) allowing for a lot more storage."
420941,tdotfisherman,2010-01-11 01:35:00,317,"Here's my boat.. probably the crappiest boat on the site, lol..  1980's Mirrocraft with a 2001 15 Horse Mercury outboard.  It's my first boat, and I've had it for six months, and its been great to me.. we've caught a LOT of fish in it so far.  Probably going to keep this package for another year or two before upgrading...  "
420968,dave524,2010-01-11 02:14:00,4508," The 90 would get 40 barely with just me and trimmed out right. Surprised on the tank location, the Sylvan had its tank back under the well at the back. I was primarily a troller so the front platform was used for little more than storage and a place to set a big igloo cooler. Console had a bench on the front with storage in it, also the seat for the driver was a good sized live well with a foam top and back rest that flipped so I most often sat facing the rear when trolling. I actually plugged the hoses for the live well on the exterior of the hull with removeable plugs and used it for tackle storage  Unlike you, if I could have made any mod, it would have been to shorten the front deck a bit and move the console forward a bit to free up more room at the back, but I was almost always running riggers and such. Great that you can customize it just to your needs."
421005,F7Firecat,2010-01-11 03:28:00,347,  Yep Caledonia it is.  Where? You will have to guess! hahahahaha
421043,jjcanoe,2010-01-11 05:14:00,744,"Here's my boat loaded up with Slowpokes Musky Gear (well some of it anyway it's only a 14'er!)  1995  Lund Adventure  side console 14', 1996 40hp Mercury oil injection    jjcanoe"
421048,SlowPoke,2010-01-11 06:55:00,2984," I moved my console ahead about an inch. More than that and I would have had to replace the livewell hoses and travel cover. Steering and control cables may have given me six more inches before upsizing. This boat also had the flip seat from factory on some models but there's no mounting evidence on mine; it came to me with a pedestal. I considered the flip bench but then decided against it for a few reasons. Limited access under the console (kicker tank lives there), I usually sit sideways, facing port and deck space. Underseat storage would have been nice but too many sacrifices. Depending on the day/species, I will remove the drivers seat and put it up front.  I also have plans to build a removable rear casting deck; same height as the front deck and will be a 30 second removal. I mostly troll but this boat will greatly benefit from a rear deck for those casting days. Plus, more storage!  I tend to run with a lot of gear, as JJ pointed out above!  If I enjoy it as much as I think I will, the next upgrade might be a new motor. I'd love to see a 90-115 Yamaha on the back so I can pass Percher to the salmon grounds"
