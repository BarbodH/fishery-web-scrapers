421630,dheitzner,2010-01-12 21:23:00,314,"Spent 4 days at Rob Hyatt's Bungalows last week(end), and as usual, had an amazing trip. The walleye bite was a bit tough, but herring, pike and ling kept us reasonably busy throughout our stay: over 60 fish for the weekend. We had to work hard for the bites that we got. The fish weren't rushing in and smashing it, they were following up and down until they'd finally commit. Didn't really seem to matter what you used, I caught fish on Buckshots, small Mepps Cyclops, Lindy Darters, micro tubes, jig and minnow combo, and the splitshot and minnow combo. Spoons were all tipped with a minnow head pinched off at the gills. As is the norm, Rob and his staff treated us extremely well. We were checked on every few hours and asked if we needed anything, minnows were refreshed steadily, fresh holes drilled outside the bungalow every day and, nice, clean, warm huts. It is service like this that keeps repeat customers coming back every year, even when the fishing is tough. Darcy"
421641,Terry,2010-01-12 21:52:00,14456,sounds like a good time
421646,Greencoachdog,2010-01-12 22:02:00,8163,"Sounds like an excellent trip!  How many Ling were caught, and was there any size to them?"
421683,FISHINGNUT,2010-01-12 23:26:00,253,Have been   thinking of booking a weekend trip with them good to hear they are a good operater.
421693,dheitzner,2010-01-13 00:04:00,314,GCD The ling were between 3 and 5lbs(approx.) Darcy
421696,e-z-out,2010-01-13 00:11:00,1052,Thats what i wanted to hear i'll be at Robs this coming monday for 3 days of fishing with a few members. Will have a report and pics when i get back .  THANKS AGAIN FOR THE REPORT DARCY
421838,bubbles,2010-01-13 13:25:00,591,"Nice job, we are heading up in a few weeks.  Can youtell me how you cought the ling?  Were you targetting them?, during the day, after dark? Just below the ice, near bottom?  I hear so many stories but have never cought one, would love to target them this year."
421854,dheitzner,2010-01-13 14:30:00,314," After the evening bite stopped, I threw a 3/16oz Lindy Max Gap Jig on my bunkside tip-up with a 4"" shiner hooked through the tail.  I placed it within about 1"" of the bottom and let it sit there, taking it up every few minutes and recharging the glow jig.  A buddy of mine also had success with a Green/Glow Buckshot spoon right on bottom with a minnow.  We would see them huggin the bottom on our Vexilars but couldn't really coax them into hitting by jigging or anything, dead-sticking seemed to be the key.  All ling were caught between 8 & 11PM. Good luck up there, Darcy"
422240,bubbles,2010-01-14 13:55:00,591,"Thanks for the explanation, I am going to try exactly that.  I have heard they were just under the ice, on the bottom etc etc etc and have never had any luck."
422245,LucG,2010-01-14 14:24:00,779,"Thanks for the report. I've been fishing near the same area with great succes. A few walleye, one pike, lots of ling, hearing & perch.  Like you, I was using a green buckshot, at about 6-8"" off the bottom.  Anyone know how callander bay, or deepwater point is doing?"
