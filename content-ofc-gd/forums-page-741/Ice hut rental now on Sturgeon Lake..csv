I just stopped in at Lunge Haven Cottages and they have a sign in the window, ""Ice Hut Rentals"" Just wanted to pass it along for anyone that might be looking. Their phone number is 705-324-6610"
421705,Rattletrap2,2010-01-13 00:42:00,1652,"I can't see why this would be a problem Cliff. You are just providing an information service.  With this whole new industry opening in the Kawartha Lakes, it will be a while before we find out about all the new businesses opening up.  Thanks for the info!"
421809,Big Cliff,2010-01-13 11:35:00,6899," Thanks Rattletrap2, just helping out was my intention but in the past I have gotten scolded because someone ""read between the lines"".  and figured I was trying to pull a fast one and make a profit or something.  Guess I'm a little gun shy these days. can't post specific information on locations, tackle, times..... I might infringe on someone elses private spot out in the middle of the lake.  Things sure have changed since this board first started."
421827,fisher,2010-01-13 12:35:00,451,"Hey Cliff,  you should take this opportunity to open up your own ice-fishing outfit (even if it were on a small scale and on a part-time basis like on the weekends, etc...).  If I recall, you are pretty handy and I am sure you could whip up a few huts in no time.  Plus it could go hand in hand with your B&B (if you are still doing that).  I know if I lived right on a lake that would be my part-time thing.  You don;t need to get rich off of it but the extra money sure comes in handy.  There is a guy on Simcoe that does this very thing out of his waterfront property and he does well - very personable too (just like you)."
