421293,bigugli,2010-01-11 22:27:00,6138,"The only problem with running a sled all out is there is no room for error or reaction time. Friend of mine got killed last March on Couch on his sled. Was running full out and hit an object jutting out from the ice. I used to trail ride a lot on the HCSA trails and we never ran more than 60kph on the ice even though our machines could do 120 ( yeah, yeah, I'm dating myself  )"
421295,cityfisher,2010-01-11 22:27:00,959,got a sled for ice fishing and used it for the first time on the weekend... damn there fast... i went like 90 kms an hour and i was like what the hell !  Then my bro calls me a wussy and goes 130 in it... Hes nuts... those things are missles!
421369,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-12 00:31:00,2038,  Yep ...  I remember those days well ...........when the speedometers were off by 40 or 50 miles an hour at top speed ....
421372,irishfield,2010-01-12 00:34:00,26272,"Don't think so fella.... had the town cop hold the radar gun up and show me the 181, that he picked me off at before I backed off coming into town. Told me to pick his daughter up in dad's other car that night..... and thinking back, that was on good old CTC Tornado tires !!!"
421375,Ron,2010-01-12 00:39:00,1683, Too funny Wayne!
421379,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-12 00:42:00,2038, I was thinking ...now how long is it going to take before Irishfield replies ....
421382,Dara,2010-01-12 00:45:00,3052,  Or the speedo that has the stop post at the end of the scale and dad says to you...how would that needle get bent in there?
421385,Dara,2010-01-12 00:47:00,3052,  130 k is cruising speed. I ride Michigan trails and they have no speed limit.
421386,Bernie,2010-01-12 00:48:00,3190,"Had a Mercedes convertible V8 at 160 MPH, a Ski-doo 115 MPH and a boat at 85 MPH. The boat at 85 was the only one that made me shake after the run. It wasn't designed to run that fast. Chine walkers scare the hell outa me."

421572,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-12 18:22:00,1022, You sir are truly nuts  You only live once right?
421574,Dara,2010-01-12 18:25:00,3052,  really...I wonder how it was for stopping on ice
421585,Muskieman,2010-01-12 18:51:00,2472,  As I recall I started tapping the brakes roughly a mile before reaching the spot...  Surprisingly you can still manage to steer at those speeds without spinning out... But you have to be ready to countersteer..  There was roughly 1/4 mile between the OPP Sleds an I.....Had I known that they were OPP ... I probably would've attempted to slow down a little... Back then they rode Ski Doo Safari Cheyenne 503 that top out at about 70.
421588,Abraxus,2010-01-12 19:09:00,104," I did 160mph in a 1967 rag top Firebird with a Chevy 350zzr crate motor I dropped into it.  Ahh...flow master series 8 exhaust, hooker ceramic headers, aluminum heads, Holly 4barrels, 4 core rad, turbo 400 tranmission and posi rear end.  What fun!  That was only 8 years ago, so they are not only the good old days! I miss that car!  My family hated it! lol They would alaways complain about going to fast.  I would tell them that we were only doing 60!  They didnt know the speedo was in miles per hour:)  I tried to add a picture of it, but it tells me the file is too large. Oh well...she is a beauty though!  Ab"
421591,irishfield,2010-01-12 19:12:00,26272, I still have mine 30 years later !  
421595,Abraxus,2010-01-12 19:22:00,104,Yup!  That sure is purdy! I love the old Mopar Muscle!  The 67 Darts with the 340 is a specail machine as well.  Not to mention the GTX and the list goes on an on!  AB  Ah...there we go!  There she be!  
421612,ciceri,2010-01-12 20:29:00,535,"No speed limit unless you are on a stickline made by the OFSC, but no one follows the speed limit on the lake, WOT!"
421082,sandybay,2010-01-11 15:26:00,64,?????????????
421085,Dara,2010-01-11 15:29:00,3052,There are none...thats why we like frozen lakes
421086,johnnyb,2010-01-11 15:30:00,3413,Safety would be what limits your speed...lots of reasons not to drive faster than 25km/h when on the ice.
421090,NAW,2010-01-11 15:42:00,4022,  Thats about as fast as my sled will go!
421092,Muskieman,2010-01-11 15:51:00,2472,I once passed two OPP sleds @ 200 KPH   with my 1983 T-Bird on my way to the Goose from Sturgeon. This was in 1992 I think.... we barely had snow and a lot of ice.  They caught up to me when I was punching my first hole near the islands...  They scalded me for driving like a lunatic.. but had nothing on the books to charge me with.   Last year I exceeded 160 Kph with the Expedition {by myself}... but my average is about 35-50 depending on the road.     I know I'll get bashed for It by some members...  I know that I'm causing a pressure wave ahead of me and it's dangerous and can cause a crack to blow up in front of me..... ...  but you know what every once in a while IT'S FUN!!  RFS 
421095,danbouck,2010-01-11 15:55:00,4380,This fast  
421130,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-11 16:32:00,10439,  I'm old I guess 'cause I lose my nerve at about 130 kmh.
421131,johnnyb,2010-01-11 16:32:00,3413,Jeeeshh...I wasn't assuming or anything...but I did speculate you were talking about driving a car/truck on the ice.  Snowmobile's a different story I guess.  184.  WOWzers
421132,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-11 16:34:00,0,i think you should have to have a licence to go that fast.  nothing bugs me more than young kids racing around on snowmobiles.  it's why i fish in a provincial park.  quiet and safe.
421144,Fisherman,2010-01-11 16:55:00,7201,"Speed limit - none, smart limit goes something like 50K, still pretty safe, you can see obstructions and big bumps and avoid them, 80K, you're starting to push the limits of being able to stop for ""stuff"", much higher than that and it says application for a Darwin award on the speedo.  I like it when they hit those pressure cracks at around 150 and go like a missle, something like that wack a penguin game and see how many bounces you can get.  You crash, my sympathy meter reads ""0"""
421163,danbouck,2010-01-11 17:19:00,4380,Here's a better one  
421171,ckrb2007,2010-01-11 17:33:00,449,I had my ice fishing sled ('92 AC Pantera 440 l/c) going across Lake Simcoe last season at a whopping speed of 87 mph. lol I think that was about as fast the old girl could go......... plus I started skipping sideways! lol

421179,sandybay,2010-01-11 19:21:00,64,Had a guy (that I think his parents are brother and sister) from a local towing company tell me today that it is 15 kph.
421187,Dara,2010-01-11 19:29:00,3052,    I think that Doo is outtawack..the 127 mph...not thw 184 k Best I have seen on mine is 176k but its not the fastest. My buddy went ripping by me.  I don't think a car going that fast would set up much of a wave. You would be ahead of it all the way.

421240,Dara,2010-01-11 20:52:00,3052,I guess they store that top speed thing so you don't have to look down while you're driving eh. Yammies don't do that.
421249,kickingfrog,2010-01-11 21:10:00,8333," Speed is relative.  I used to have a speedometer on my bicycle that would keep the ""top speed"". Coming down Blue Mountain during a triathlon my speed hit 91 km/h. Good thing I didn't know it at the time  That felt about as fast as any other speed I have attained. Watch the skeleton during the Olympics. Centimeters off the ice in a ""tunnel"" traveling well over a 100 km/h and no brakes."
421269,IndySKS,2010-01-11 21:54:00,134, There i fixed it for you.....
421272,irishfield,2010-01-11 21:56:00,26272,You haven't witnessed speed.. until you have the 150 MPH speedo in your '69 SuperBee.. wrapped around the bottom and sitting at 20MPH. Ahhh.. the good old days...
421274,sandybay,2010-01-11 21:57:00,64,What go fast.lol
421278,vinnimon,2010-01-11 22:04:00,2593,"Im not sure who likes racing their sleds here on OFC. but you may want to go to puslinch lake in cameridge.They time and race them there,every weekend.Some of the top sleds hit over 125miles per hour.AS told to me by the keeper a year ago.Love watching them race while ice fishing.Sometimes the dirt bikes and enduros come out to play on the ice.Just an FYI for yas out there.cheers"
