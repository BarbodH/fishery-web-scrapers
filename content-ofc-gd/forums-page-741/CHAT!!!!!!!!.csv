421778,bigfish1965,2010-01-13 05:23:00,3382,The chat feature is now disabled as we ramp up to the new software. The old chat software was not compatible.
421780,vinnimon,2010-01-13 05:39:00,2593,ok
421782,steelheadvanisl,2010-01-13 05:46:00,5,I was just starting to like the story though....
421829,Greencoachdog,2010-01-13 12:39:00,8163,  It was good to see you in there last night Rick!
421931,Greencoachdog,2010-01-13 17:26:00,8163,"  Hey Rick!  How about a ""who's in chat button"" on this next go 'round... to keep the phonies and pretenders out. I know some on here find it great sport to pose as someone else and mess with the minds of the extremely gullible.  Like the rich and famous actually have the time and desire  to grace us poor, pathetic, gotta-getta-life, chatroom losers with their magnificent presence!!!  Hey Tom!... are you really sure you were chattin' with Sarah Palin the other night?"
