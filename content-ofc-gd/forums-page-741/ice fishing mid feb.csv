422324,I'mHooked,2010-01-14 19:33:00,525,"Head to lake Simcoe or Bay of Quinte. Do a search for ""Simcoe (or Qunite) ice hut rentals"" Both big bodies of water with lots of hut operators & lots of fish. Quinte would be mainly for Walleye & Simcoe would be mainly Lake Trout & White fish (or Perch)."

422339,ziekertail,2010-01-14 20:53:00,5,thanks johnny any clue what lake there on?
422344,johnnyb,2010-01-14 21:11:00,3413,Sorry...I meant Kashaga Lodge (click this) on Lake Kashagawigamog.  All those names sound the same to me...
422374,Jer,2010-01-14 22:32:00,1426,  That's more like Haliburton rather than the Kawarthas.  I believe that there are one or two operators out of Bewdley on Rice and Cliff mentioned something about Lunge Haven on Sturgeon.
