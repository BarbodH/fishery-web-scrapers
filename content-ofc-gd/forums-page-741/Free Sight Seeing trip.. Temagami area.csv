421440,fishnsled,2010-01-12 02:32:00,3520,Awesome!  That last video clip I had the image full screen.  I then grabbed onto the monitor to keep the horizon level and almost like I was flying!    Thanks Lloyd for the images and Wayne for taking us the journey.
421445,discophish,2010-01-12 02:47:00,392,"That is an awesome tour!  Thank you for sharing the clips.  I really enjoyed them.  When a good buddy of mine said let's go to flight school after high school, I shrugged my shoulders to it.  Now he's pilot for WestJet.  Everyone's dream is to fly.  I wish I had that dream a while ago so that I would have the opportunity to personally fly over Temagami as you do behind the controls."
421507,Spiel,2010-01-12 12:51:00,9065, Well that makes sense. Thank you.
421623,fishhunter,2010-01-12 21:07:00,604,Well it was a blast and would do it again in a heart beat. Wayne I am your video man anytime lol see you in 5 weeks
421628,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-01-12 21:18:00,1362," ...you're absolutely right Roy!!!..I take it all back  .....  Hey Lloyd,....thanks for the scenic video....it was awesome!!!!"
421648,lookinforwalleye,2010-01-12 22:03:00,4399,What can I say except wow very cool!!!  Sure beats the hell out of driving up the 400 to go fishin.
420956,irishfield,2010-01-11 01:59:00,26272,"Finally got Lloyd's SD card, from our escapades back in September, 2009  Be sure to click full screen to get the full effect !!!  Here's our take off from my camp...heading for Eagle Lake for big pike with the canoe on the side of the airplane.  Wave at Leah on the way by !!      The start up after pulling anchor on Eagle lake.. no fish there.      Taxing on Eagle to give you a view of the peace and tranquility...other than that engine running.      Curving take off from Eagle lake.. heading for a better fishing ground.      Nice shot of Diamond Lake from the air.      Landing on Fry Lake      A nice scenic trip from Kokoko Lake to the townsite of Temagami, and my dock.   "
420985,danbouck,2010-01-11 02:34:00,4380,That first one brought back some memories. I gotta get back up there!
420988,kickingfrog,2010-01-11 02:42:00,8333,"I was getting a little nervous there, the prop kept stopping."
421001,Jds63,2010-01-11 03:15:00,1365,very nice .... felt like i was there with ya on my 23 inch monitor my buddy fly's as well and took me over Algonquin Park a few years back
421010,tizfun,2010-01-11 03:36:00,292,Sweet.... I too felt like I was sitting right there...  Take off and landings were the best...  Awesome scenery..  Thanks so much for getting me up there..  lol  Tiz
421019,walleyemaster,2010-01-11 03:49:00,325,thats awsome wayne..your so lucky to actually see temagami this way..nice videos
421024,jayess,2010-01-11 03:58:00,187,few people get to experience Ontario like you do. thanks for giving us a virtual sample
421027,corvette1,2010-01-11 04:19:00,1765,awesome view nothing like it
421047,Twocoda,2010-01-11 05:49:00,4130,that was awesome   ....brings back memories for me too when i worked in forest protection in New Brunswick....  beautiful area .. should do it again in the fall when the colours are out  thanks for sharing.... i totally enjoyed it
421058,Spiel,2010-01-11 11:27:00,9065,"Thank you Wayne, I too really enjoyed that.  Admittedly though I was surprised to see a stick instead of a yoke (is that correct terminology?).  I was also surprised to find that during the last clip that I was constantly tilting my head to keep the horizon level, just like I was there....LOL  Oh and I saw the shoals."
421066,bigugli,2010-01-11 13:56:00,6138,Such a breathtaking view from up in a bushplane. Haven't been in a single in over 20 years and all I could do was oooh and aaah. I do envy you Wayne.
421074,b2kptbo,2010-01-11 14:21:00,1505,"That was a fun ride, thanks..."
421075,BUSTER,2010-01-11 15:12:00,1336,Thats awsome.
421122,bubbles,2010-01-11 16:24:00,591,"Thanks for the ride, that was cool."
421148,Terry,2010-01-11 16:59:00,14456,first why was the prop not turning when you were about to land and I threw up twice watching the videos I guess I'm not much of a flyer
421159,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-01-11 17:16:00,1362,That was awesome.....thanks Wayne
421211,anders,2010-01-11 20:05:00,1168,very cool!!  Thanks
421236,Roy,2010-01-11 20:37:00,13728,Why are we thanking Wayne? All he did was pilot the thing. It's Lloyd we should be thanking for the lovely video clips!
421257,moose,2010-01-11 21:27:00,266,nice view making me think its last week of june and heading on lakelands plane to diamond darren gets up a little faster though wayne even with my extra weight in front of plane hahahahahahahahahah
421266,irishfield,2010-01-11 21:45:00,26272,"Yah.. he's got 3 times the horsepower too Malcolm ! When he's weighted down with the same pound/HP ratio we're identical for take off.. as we both have the same airfoil design on our wings!  Spiel.. you are correct.. Stick.. not Yoke. Stick is simple to build control wise.. yoke is more complex.. extra weight and I hate flying with my arms out like driving a car. Last clip Lloyd just set the camera in the corner of the windshield adn why it's crooked. Before Spring I hope to pick up some tiny cameras that I can mount on the wing, tail and float to record some nice stuff for next season.  Terry... why I carry barf bags in the airplane !!    Prop Stop???... you know how shutter speed works and light frequencies. You can actually verify that your tach is correct by going out at night and running the airplane up in front of a light standard.. or portable work light. Any division of 60.. the prop will look like it's perfectly still.. so 1200 rpm... 1800 rpm... 2400 rpm  will all look like the prop has stopped. When I come in to land I usually pull back to about 1500 rpm.. so I guess Lloyds shutter speed is some division of that..  Roy... I'm just surprised that Lloyd could let go of the ""oh crap"" handles long enough to play with the camera..."
421273,glen,2010-01-11 21:56:00,2641,That motor sounds smooth.
421284,Radnine,2010-01-11 22:12:00,1538,I love the wrap-around instrument panel Wayne (I'm guessing those are the engine dials on the right?). Have you got a GPS in that plane (I didn't see it if you do). Does Murphy make anything in a tandem? Jim
421305,irishfield,2010-01-11 22:46:00,26272,"Not a lot of monitoring needed Jim. Yes the right side of the panel is oil pressure.. oil temp..amp gauge.. volt meter.. below it CHT, EGT, Left fuel, Right fuel. Tachometer on the right side of the main panel... below it is an ice detector for my carburator throat.  GPS is in the Radio you see in the panel.. It's a Bendix KLX135.. $4200 item when I bought it. Would prefer a moving map now.. but can't justify it.    Only thing Murphy makes in a tandem is the Renegade bi-planes. Nothing wrong with a 44"" wide (that's 6"" wider than a C185!) cabin. I like my wife beside me.. not behind me like an Afhgan lady."
421306,walleyejigger,2010-01-11 22:48:00,876,tres tres cool
421351,TJQ,2010-01-12 00:06:00,7806,LOL.. great vids Wayne!!
