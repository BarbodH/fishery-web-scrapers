421141,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-01-11 16:45:00,1362," I just heard the same thing regarding ice conditions....some areas are wide open and others have 3 - 4"" of ice...the winds have a lot to do with the open water...  Rob....I can probably arrange to rent a cabin on Diamond next winter with huts included...would you be interested??"
421143,Headhunter,2010-01-11 16:54:00,5703,"Based on recent reports and last years ""success"" I would say that you need to make a new sign, that will allow you to insert anyone's name, BUT Lloyd! Wayne will fit in there as well! LMAO HH"
421718,walleyemaster,2010-01-13 01:12:00,325, hey steve give me the details...sounds intresting..although i would like to fish on temagami a few days as well..
414611,irishfield,2009-12-22 22:59:00,26272,  8 inches of ice from town to my place.. and my neighbour even has our parking plowed at the dock (so that the ice can get thicker not being insulated by snow)!
414614,Terry,2009-12-22 23:06:00,14456,looking good   and I AM TERRY
414615,Terry,2009-12-22 23:07:00,14456,oh wait   those signs are used  when we are not there   
414616,irishfield,2009-12-22 23:08:00,26272,What... you thought I was inviting you back ! LMAO !  Lloyd.. Lloyd.. you packed yet??? lol
414617,Terry,2009-12-22 23:09:00,14456,I know where Lloyd is this week  I think he's still there
414618,irishfield,2009-12-22 23:10:00,26272,"I have a ""warm fuzzy"" feeling I know where he's been this week as well..."
414656,Ron,2009-12-23 00:41:00,1683,Lloyd won't be back til Sat. We are hoping to get out on Sunday. I'm going out Thursday to check the ice out and hope on Sunday to have the sleds up and running to tow the huts out.  I'm getting all warm and fuzzy inside now! (Must be the rum).....
414662,irishfield,2009-12-23 00:50:00,26272,He was online earlier today...edumacation must have been over for the day!  Was thinking of a trip to that lake myself...
414664,Terry,2009-12-23 00:51:00,14456,yeah I was talking to Lloyd about that lake the other day myself.  but was thinking of walking not sleding..LOL
414668,irishfield,2009-12-23 01:02:00,26272,Guess I'd better get the hyfax runners onto my hut and the flip tube hardware all changed over to aircraft bolts/nuts. Sounds like it's almost go time..
414670,Ron,2009-12-23 01:06:00,1683,"I will let you guys know on Christmas day after the kids and inlaws are gone how we made out. Confident to say there will be at least 5 inches of ice. They didn't get a whole lot of snow.  Cheers, Ron..."
414740,Joey,2009-12-23 04:18:00,9122,Looking good Hun.  Now make sure if you invite us up this season that it's the absolute coldest day of the year!!! Wouldn't want to break a tradition
414744,irishfield,2009-12-23 04:26:00,26272,Just make sure Paul has new batteries in the truck !!  Not sure how many trips we'll get in this year. I've got a LOT of work in the shop this winter.... to get done before the first of May.

415089,Headhunter,2009-12-24 15:57:00,5703,"Hey, what's so bad about being Joe? It seems to me to be somewhat of a select group who can have a sign made just from them! lmao! HH"

421031,irishfield,2010-01-11 04:31:00,26272,Look up Rob... that's the picture from Saturday !! It's not snow.. just wind and water movement. There is very little snow up there.. sled trails aren't even open.  Have never fished Diamond.. but check my Diamond overflight video.. pause it and look for shoals! lol
