422244,Mike Pike,2010-01-14 14:21:00,1332,"Awesome!  I always thought a fishing show would be great on radio.  Especially on sports radio stations where you have such a huge male demo.  Funny but on the Fan 590, they'll talk about America college basketball before fishing and I think there are far more fisherman listening than, fans of college basketball.  I don't even wanna talk about Barkleys Outdoor Journal with Angelo Viola that they carry Saturday mornings.  That thing is aweful!!!!!!!"
