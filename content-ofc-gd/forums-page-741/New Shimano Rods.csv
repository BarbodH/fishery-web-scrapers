421923,sconceptor,2010-01-13 17:19:00,146,"Mike, who, switches to Abu????  Where does tackle tour get the babes to hold the tackle  and pose for reviews, they need more photos.....just like beer commercials!!!!!???"
421932,sconceptor,2010-01-13 17:26:00,146,"never mind about the Mike question....I looked at Abu's website....Mike Iaconelli, pro bass fisherman, has switched.  I've never like Abu much.....bought a few when I first got back into fishing after college and want my first casting reel(Eon) and a musky reel(C4).  Not very impressed.  Rather spend the extra 100$ and get a Curado or Cardiff or Calcutta or Chronarch!!! Stradics are sweet too.  Maybe if I bought the highest end Abu I'd be more impressed, but since I've switched to Shimano, it's going to be a tough sell or a great deal for me to try......I'm not even impressed with my Quatum PT Energy Burner from 2years ago, when the old model dropped 100$ or so......would've thought the same quality as a curado or chronach but nope......"
