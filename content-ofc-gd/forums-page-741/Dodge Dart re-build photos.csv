421746,kickingfrog,2010-01-13 02:01:00,8333,"Since a few guys posted photos of some old cars on the ""speed limit on open lakes post"" I thought I'd post some photos of my father in-laws Dodge Dart that he just finished working on.  I know squat about this stuff, so your questions will likely go unanswered. Feel Free to post yours, just cause I know squat doesn't mean I don't like to look.        "
421748,irishfield,2010-01-13 02:05:00,26272,Dang.. it's even got the right Thermoquad on it ! Now tell him to get rid of the CTC battery and hold down bar.. and put a script battery in it and he's golden!      
421750,kickingfrog,2010-01-13 02:13:00,8333, English please?
421752,irishfield,2010-01-13 02:17:00,26272,"See da battery in mine.. he needs one ! lol  Rochestor carburator = correct... most have Holleys on them ! I guess the real name for them is ""Quadrajet""... not sure why, but as ""kids"" we always called them thermoquads. Maybe because they never worked right when they got hot!! LOL"
421754,Sinker,2010-01-13 02:29:00,8692,Sweet rides fella's!! Ya gotta love the old dodge's.  S.
421755,Greencoachdog,2010-01-13 02:30:00,8163,A very clean SWINGER Rob!!!  Beats the hell outta waynes super chicken any day!!!
421804,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-13 11:12:00,1107,Nice wheels for sure gotta love old Mopars. My Dodge is a 06 magnum no where near the power of the old ones and no IT doesn't have a hemi .    but it tows the boat nicely.
421830,Bigfisherman,2010-01-13 12:46:00,100,"Nice, I had a white 68 Dodge Dart GTS 340 4spd was a fun ride, I want to get into another one eventually but for the last 12 years+ been running a 700hp forced induction v8 that keeps me happy on nice weather non fishing days:)"
421839,blaque,2010-01-13 13:37:00,2419,Sweet vehicles..............im not a dart fan however as i got hit by one as a kid.
421880,shane,2010-01-13 15:25:00,652,"Man, I miss the old days when you could open the hood and actually see the motor.  I once had a '68 Dodge pickup that had so much room in the engine compartment that I could sit on the fender with my legs inside when I was working on the motor. (which I did a lot).  The body steel was so thick, you could break a toe kicking it.(which I also did a lot)."
421895,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-13 16:17:00,10439,  We used to call them Quadrabogs!!!
421996,Abraxus,2010-01-13 19:27:00,104," Is that your Superbird? The plymouth was a Superbird and the Dodge was a Daytona Charger right? From what I understand, it is basically the Road Runner but with the areodynamic nose and spoiler ya?  That thing owned Nascar until it was banned! Built for the big speed tracks like Talladega Speedway. Thats a nice car!  If the numbers match with the original motor, she gotta be worth a bundle to say the least!   Ab"
421998,blaque,2010-01-13 19:32:00,2419,I thought all you guys had  tucked away up there were Red Barchettas at your uncles farm ??  (sorry......my best attempt at a GCD impression lol)
422000,Bernie,2010-01-13 19:40:00,3190,While this one isn't a neck snapper it does cruise along nicely.    And for me I'll take a Quadrajet over a gas guzzling Holley anytime.
422021,Roy,2010-01-13 20:37:00,13728, Click on his signature....you'll see how much it's worth.
422026,glen,2010-01-13 20:58:00,2641,Nice cars guys.  I have had this one since 1986.  
422028,kickingfrog,2010-01-13 21:07:00,8333, Nice Glen! Why don't we use that one to tow your boat?

422103,moparhawk,2010-01-14 01:18:00,146,heres mine. Canadian made too! Did you know all 340 Darts were made in Canada?
422126,douG,2010-01-14 02:01:00,2693,"Aaaaaaand, it comes complete with Wire-wheel spoke fenders and two-way sneeze through wind vents, star-studded mud guards, sponge-coated edible steering column, chrome fender dents - and factory air conditioned air from our fully factory-equipped air conditioned factory!
