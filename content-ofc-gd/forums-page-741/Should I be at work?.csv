421668,Greencoachdog,2010-01-12 22:36:00,8163,  You should prolly be at work if you don't have anything better to do than look at the time on the board!  I think the new server is out of Virginia and something like this would be quite typical for them!... 2 hrs. behind time.. a day late and a dollar short... can't spell.......... can you see where this is going?
