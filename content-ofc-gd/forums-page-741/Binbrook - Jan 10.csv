421537,Mike Pike,2010-01-12 16:41:00,1332,"I was out at another Conservation Area on Sunday, Buck, and we only managed ONE Crappie, so well done!  lol  Yup, it was cold.  Gotta get me some cover!"
421566,Fang,2010-01-12 17:35:00,1330,"For the rest of you those are 2 lb crappie. Beside Goran they only look like 8""ers  Good going - let me know if your heading out in January for any more ice, maybe we can meet up somewhere"
422007,ehg,2010-01-13 20:02:00,2666, Catching some fish is what is all about. At least you didn't waste time and gas going to the Kawarthas.
422190,limeyangler,2010-01-14 04:44:00,5204,"Good job, sounds like conditions were tough, so all in all a solid effort man!"
422234,Spiel,2010-01-14 13:06:00,9065,Binbrook is only 20 minutes away for me and yet I've never ice fished it. However I'm hoping to make it out to the Fishing World Binbrook Crappie Derby this year on Feb. 7th.  Are you going to be attending Goran?
422267,Uncle Buck,2010-01-14 15:41:00,1000,"I'll be attending, but won't be fishing the derby...  i've never pulled a crappie out of there that was worth bragging about...  we killed them last year the same day as the derby but again, nothing of any size  Here's a Shot...  "
422278,Spiel,2010-01-14 16:43:00,9065, Now that's a fine looking mess of fish. Perhaps I'll see you there Goran.
