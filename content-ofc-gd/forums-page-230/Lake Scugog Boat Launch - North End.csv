859789,Drew_10,2014-06-22 00:01:00,111,Does anyone know of a public launch on the north end of Lake Scugog?  Does Pleasant Point Park have a launch? Thanks for any help!
859798,pikeyminnow,2014-06-22 02:27:00,18,Yeah there is a launch at Pleasant Point. I haven't used it in a few years but it wasn't too bad when I launched there last time. There is also a launch on the north end of Scugog Island however the road into it is a bit rough.
