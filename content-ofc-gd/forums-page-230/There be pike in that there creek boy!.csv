But he did earn his Lac Seul wings that day  . He was in the boat non stop for 7 hours, chipper as the moment he got in and upset to tears almost when we finally had to come off the lake....definitely not worried about taking the trip up to the big water with him now....Jube-Jubes, a couple of water guns, some nets in his size, frequent breaks for snacks and drinks andto do what he wants to do and seven hours later we were still good to go!   nice little spot. That rod makes for some fun  action with those toothy little gems Its 10 minutes from the centre of Dryden, very convenient, loads of pike and perch (kids love the action) and HUGE walleye....if you know where they are. That rod is my absolute favourite, I LOVE IT! Its a Shimano Sojourn, 2 piece, 6' Medium action:fast. It is super light , with plenty of backbone, and very sensitive to lethargic lunkers in 30'FOW. Have caught 32"" walleye and BIG pike with that thing. ANOTHER GOOD THING ABOUT IT........$29!"
