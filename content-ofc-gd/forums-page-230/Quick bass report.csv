859982,ccmtcanada,2014-06-23 21:22:00,7971,"About 6 weeks ago, I was packaged out of my job of 22 years.  It came has a huge shock, but now that has worn off and I've decided is take the entire summer of before looking for my next job.  I hope to fish as much as possible!!  This is a great opportunity for me to get out there  I've been waiting for bass season to open, so as soon as my little one was off to school, I hightailed it to Lake Scugog. It's about 40 minutes door to launch so it's prefect so I can be home when school is out.  I launched at 10am and headed out.  The weeds seem to be really behind schedule and it took a while for me to find what I was looking for.  The first 3 hours was brutally slow and the winds were blowing me around pretty good, so I looked for some wind protection.  Fishnsled texted me asking how it was going...and as soon as I said this lake sucks I started hitting a few fish.  The first were about this size.   I said out loud ""ok little guys....where's your parents??""   In about 25 minutes I boated 3 this size...   At 215 it was time for me to head back to the launch and head home.  It's great living this close to Scugog....even though I don't really like the lake, I'll fish there more this summer and see if I can figure it out!"
859986,kickingfrog,2014-06-23 21:40:00,8333,Nice fish Cliff. Late spring and a season starting a week earlier then most of us are used to means lots of learning.
859996,Pigeontroller,2014-06-24 00:38:00,2793,I too had an appt. with Dr. Summerof and plan to fish as much as possible. Come down and join me for a day of Bassin on Erie sometime Cliff.
859999,Dan668,2014-06-24 01:03:00,1120,I was on scugog yesterday.  Not much action. Managed a few  crappie on pitching jigs oddly.
860002,206,2014-06-24 01:34:00,563,Nice report...I was on the scugog river this weekend and only managed a few under 3 pounds. Saturday morn the bite was so off I actually ended up drop shotting and got 3 large mouth on it lol. I had 6 blow ups in the pads but never hooked 1. Biggest fish came on a wacky rig.
860009,ccmtcanada,2014-06-24 01:49:00,7971,I may just take you up on that!   I've never fished Erie before!
860012,ccmtcanada,2014-06-24 01:53:00,7971,I hit llly pads in about 3 feet of water and got nothing.  Then spent a lot of time trying to find weed beds in the 6-8 foot range.  I was amazed how little the weeds are in because of the late spring.  I threw spinnerbaits and got nothing so I figured I had to slow down my presentation.  All fish were caught deep in the weeds on a weightless senko rigged Texas style.
860021,Sinker,2014-06-24 02:47:00,8692,"No musky?  Im off every other tues/wed if you want to hook up for a local fish, while the kids are at school  You still in whitby area?  S."
860024,ccmtcanada,2014-06-24 02:51:00,7971,Problem is the kids are off school Friday!  Haha.  I didn't target Muskie today....was trying out a new bass rod I got for my birthday. Lol. I was thinking of heading out Wednesday and/or Thursday this week.  Is this an off week for you?  I'm still in Whitby.
860032,Sinker,2014-06-24 04:13:00,8692,"Oh ya....forgot school is out...duh!  This is a week im off, but ive already made plans. Maybe we can work something out 2 weeks from now. Its not as easy with kids out of school....my son is usually first mate.  S."
860039,misfish,2014-06-24 09:40:00,29133,"Well Cliff that just sucks. I mean you fishing all summer.  Serious though, sorry to hear  about the job dude.   Nice fish man."
860059,The Urban Fisherman,2014-06-24 12:36:00,2050,"Awesome stuff Cliff - sorry to hear about the job but I'd take it as a blessing if I were you... You'll have a GREAT summer and will be able to look for something refreshing.  I've only fished the bog once and that day my dad caught his PB largie (4+ lbs), a good sized walleye and had a sizeable muskie chase his bait to the boat... all three fish came on a GIANT muskie sized spinnerbait... at a creek mouth... I on the other hand didn't catch a damn thing that day.. but I know there are some good fish to be had!  Cheers, Ryan"
860084,easytalknguy,2014-06-24 15:45:00,7,"Nice, Cliff. Good start at opening   Rubin"
860086,Headhunter,2014-06-24 15:48:00,5703,Look at the yapper on that... and the fish looks pretty good to! Well done Cliff! HH
860095,fishnsled,2014-06-24 16:08:00,3520,"Just let me know when you are going next and I'll text earlier in the day. I sure that's what did it. I wonder if that works when you are in the boat with me?  Will have to try that on the weekend.   Great to see you ended up with a few fish, nicely done."
860108,ccmtcanada,2014-06-24 17:03:00,7971,Thanks everyone!  And Will...text me at 11am this Thursday lol
