859763,glen,2014-06-21 18:36:00,2641,The plumbers aint open till monday so i have a question.  Between my meter and shut off i have a expansion relief valve (Watts 530).  It is about 20 years old and leaking. I dont think i had an over pressure and its set at 150psi. Do i really need it? I have a plug and that would be easier. 
859770,aplumma,2014-06-21 20:05:00,6896,IF you are talking about a well system then you need it to protect your water system from over pressuring if the switch arc's together. If it is city water then it is rare to see one and our local codes do not require one. The water heater also has a pressure temperature relief valve to safe guard the system. The water heater one is set usually at 120 lbs. The well tank one is set at 75 psi using a rv50 valve.  Please be advised that the statement is for the rules and regulations for the USA and may not be correct for Canadian building codes.  Good luck    Art
