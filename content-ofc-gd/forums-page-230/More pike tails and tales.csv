We were all over the pike again with the suspending husky jerks getting most of the attention, although I did get a couple on x-raps. The biggest difference was that my brother didn't get any hits on top-waters. He usually has a couple of swipes at least from the pike on top but nothing this time. No big ones but lots of action to keep us busy. Two musky follows but no contact. We each lost a hard fighting fish while trolling.  Edit to add: My brother saw a gar as well but couldn't generate a strike.         On the drive home the topic of a fins and feathers fall trip north came up... as spring ends, we're already thinking of fall. "
