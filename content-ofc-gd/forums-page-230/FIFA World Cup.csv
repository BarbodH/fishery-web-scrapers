859718,SirWhite,2014-06-21 00:33:00,210,Seems every sport or election could be rigged according to some. Would explain the Leafs
858876,bigugli,2014-06-16 23:42:00,6138," Klompen zijn voor bonken, niet voor bonking"
858878,kickingfrog,2014-06-17 00:11:00,8333,"An opinion cannot be fact. That is a fact, not an opinion."
858879,BillM,2014-06-17 00:13:00,17367,"The Italian team is the WORST lol  There are a few teams that have taken the 'diving' throne from the Italians.  I gotta admit, they are actually getting better.  Great game between Ghana and the US today."
858893,limeyangler,2014-06-17 00:58:00,5204,"Whats with the ""football is crap because people dive"" bandwagon?  Not original, not even a fair reflection of a very good game. A game that has been  enjoyed as the 'National' sport of many countries all over the world for over a century....all over that world except for North America( until very recently)."
858898,BillM,2014-06-17 01:09:00,17367,"If people don't like diving, they shouldn't be watching hockey either"
858900,Steve,2014-06-17 01:26:00,2075,"Kadri's down in Brazil learning a few new ""moves""."
858901,BillM,2014-06-17 01:34:00,17367,"Kadri's down in Brazil learning a few new ""moves"".  Along with all of the Boston Bruins I'm guessing as well"
858903,HTHM,2014-06-17 01:35:00,4082,What I wanna know is why if your from Holland are you called Dutch from the Netherlands.   Pick one!!!  lol the difference between Holland and the Netherlands
858905,grimsbylander,2014-06-17 01:42:00,3016,"Hey family forum here...no discussing bonken, or bonking!"
858968,Mike Pike,2014-06-17 14:14:00,1332, the difference between Holland and the Netherlands  That is absolutely hilarious HTHM.  And confusing.  lol
859447,misfish,2014-06-19 19:58:00,29133,"England is in tough. Come on boys,get it together."
859448,BillM,2014-06-19 20:00:00,17367,Rooney almost had that header... almost!
859451,Miranda1,2014-06-19 20:16:00,3,Rooney must be just killing himself for missing that header. Interesting first half though.
859452,davey buoy,2014-06-19 20:22:00,5505,"Columbia won't be scoring on there own net again I can say,Looking for them to do well,or certain players won't be around next time  .Go Columbia!!!!!! Sorry for side tracking,just had me thinking of the circumstances"
859456,misfish,2014-06-19 20:33:00,29133,ROONEY GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
859459,misfish,2014-06-19 20:54:00,29133,Great game. Well played Uruguay.
859498,chris.brock,2014-06-19 23:26:00,4053,"I'm not a soccer fan, I just tried to watch Greece/ Jap, the diving, drama and theatrics, what a joke, is this a sport or a fashion show?"
859518,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-20 00:34:00,10439,"Had to post this, it's too funny not to.  http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/84168709/"
859524,BillM,2014-06-20 00:46:00,17367,"I'm not a soccer fan, I just tried to watch Greece/ Jap, the diving, drama and theatrics, what a joke, is this a sport or a fashion show?  I wouldn't even call that soccer.  Did Greece get over center more then 2 times the entire game?  And Japan?  Might wanna get a bit closer to the net before you attempt to score."
859601,misfish,2014-06-20 14:08:00,29133,"I enjoyed watching Japan play. They sure play a different game. And ya,get closer. They should of won that game. Lots of chances to score."
859634,Headhunter,2014-06-20 17:17:00,5703,I'll admit that I am not a fan...but I was a huge fan during the summer Olympics watching the women play. Far more entertaining without all the broadway antics. Won't even touch the subject of game fixing... HH
859641,davey buoy,2014-06-20 17:50:00,5505,"I'll admit that I am not a fan...but I was a huge fan during the summer Olympics watching the women play.

HH Don't touch that,but the reading is out there.I believe the winner may have been chosen,if what I heard was true.That would be real bad if that is happening."
859645,BillM,2014-06-20 17:58:00,17367,People say the winner is chosen every 4 years..  It's nothing new
859646,davey buoy,2014-06-20 18:04:00,5505,"People say the winner is chosen every 4 years..  It's nothing new I hear you on that,but wish I could of read Manderin,one chinese type paper went into great detail how that happens.Really hope it isn't true.That will ruin everything imo."

858184,leaf4,2014-06-13 21:48:00,2466,"I know not everyone likes soccer, but being the worlds most played game I know there's lots out there.  During World Cup time I bleed Oranje for The Netherlands!  Who are you cheering for?   ps that Netherlands win against Spain was a taste of sweet sweet redemption, hopefully Howard Webb doesn't ruin our chances for gold this time around."
858185,Steve,2014-06-13 21:51:00,2075,Soccer     (go Germany)
858187,misfish,2014-06-13 21:52:00,29133,Brazil and Germany
858191,davey buoy,2014-06-13 21:55:00,5505,PS4 or xbox predicted a Brazil/Germany final.Germany wins.Wonder how many are betting on that prediction?.I took Germany lol.
858196,misfish,2014-06-13 22:20:00,29133,  Whats that
858197,Dan668,2014-06-13 22:22:00,1120,Ukraine didn't make it. Usually root for Spain or Brazil. Spain were completely embarrassed today. Wasn't impressed by Brazils first game either. I think a team in South America will take it this year.
858199,Dan668,2014-06-13 22:23:00,1120,"PS4 or xbox predicted a Brazil/Germany final.Germany wins.Wonder how many are betting on that prediction?.I took Germany lol.  Germany has a strong team. Im betting against, only because a few friends of mine are hardcore fans."
858204,davey buoy,2014-06-13 22:37:00,5505," Germany has a strong team. Im betting against, only because a few friends of mine are hardcore fans. It's funny ,they did the same game playoff or what you want to call it(simulation) last time.They predicted Spain,and guess who won.lol.I don't put a lot of faith in it,but it's something.And heck I don't know enough to pick a winner on my own anyway.Go Germany !!!!!!!!"
858209,Ice Fishing Ham,2014-06-13 22:45:00,83,Any team but Brazil.
858211,misfish,2014-06-13 22:49:00,29133,Any team but Brazil.  Or Italy.  I want to see a grown man cry.LOL
858229,kickingfrog,2014-06-13 23:13:00,8333,"Not the biggest footbol fan but I watch the big games, both club and international. At its best, it is great spectacle and I love it. At its worst, it is mind numbingly dull and frustrating with the diving, grimacing, writhing and atrocious calls."
858232,misfish,2014-06-13 23:18:00,29133,     
858233,gino,2014-06-13 23:19:00,400,Deutschland uber alles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hup Holland Hup! That one header by VanPersie will make the highlight reel for many years to come."
858351,davey buoy,2014-06-14 16:42:00,5505,Columbia sure has some shnazy moves.Their looking pretty good so far.
858466,Paudash,2014-06-15 03:35:00,273,"hoping they get they get a ton of rain then a major cold snap to freeze it, then they could play hockey and then I could care.  I try every 4 years to get into it and I just do not get it.  I find it just so boring.  Also I only listen to AM radio and I watch way to many fishing shows so it is hard to bore me."
858472,grimsbylander,2014-06-15 04:01:00,3016,"Soccer is awesome you just have to understand HOW to watch it. The secret is to record the game, crack open a beer, get some snacks, and sit back and get ready to enjoy a fast, action packed game...on fast forward."
858644,iFish4real,2014-06-16 01:47:00,386,Deutschland uber alles!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ewww  yuck  ...Honduras all the way  :D
858649,Gerritt,2014-06-16 02:15:00,6129,Being Dutch of course is am rooting for Nederlands! Go Robbin! Hup Holland Hup!  G
858653,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-16 02:25:00,10439,GO LEAFS GO!!!!! Soccer is like hockey without the entertainment value!!!! And players going down like the Hindenberg when they get their shins bumped!!!!
858658,bigugli,2014-06-16 02:38:00,6138,"All these klompers shouting Hup, Holland, Hup? I still vividly recall Nederlands being beaten by a bunch of Danish milk men recently during UEFA competition."
858684,HTHM,2014-06-16 10:34:00,4082,"Fair warning, BigUgli, there is nothing more dangerous than a P-Oed dutchman with his wifes backing......Thems fightin words there buddy."

858754,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-16 14:36:00,10439,    
858856,SirWhite,2014-06-16 21:54:00,210,Lots of haters. Lol. No better spectator sport in the whole world. Fact  They're only armour; shin pads. Not even a cup. The boots are not leather but paper thin top to create barefoot feeling and better traction on the ball. Ankles and calves have only socks over them. Everyone uses METAL studs on the bottom of their boots. Obviously every match is going to have small injuries that the players are able to walk off. Kinda like a snapshot in the skate while blocking a shot.   The sport does have a problem with the Uber dramatic. The World Cup has a problem with Officiating  The Italian team is the WORST lol
