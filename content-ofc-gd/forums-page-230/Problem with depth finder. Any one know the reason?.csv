859365,pidge,2014-06-19 03:24:00,438,"Hey guys and gals. A buddy and I were out fishing last weekend and a strange thing happened with the depth finder. For whatever reason the screen would go all funny with verticle lines and the depth would be off...way off. It's a problem that didn't happen all the time. Just random. Shutting off the unit would sometimes solve it, but within miniuts the issue would come back. Fishing in 30' and a bottom that looked like Mars surface for instance all of a sudden these verticle lines would appear and the depth would read 1' maybe 2'???? We tryed fooling with the wires in the back of the unit, but had no luck with that. Connections look fine, but I'm sure there might be something internal that's messed up. Anyone ever come across something like this before? And if so did you find a solution. Don't have money right now to go and buy a new unit and this one marks or at least did mark the bottom flawlessly. I've included a few pics to help explain better. Thanks.  Pidge.   "
859367,Gerritt,2014-06-19 03:48:00,6129,Unhook the transducer and put the unit into demo mode. If the lines are still there it is a problem with the head unit/LCD screen. If they disappear then I would suspect the transducer as the culprit.  G
859369,Paudash,2014-06-19 04:19:00,273,"looks like a transducer issue, it might be riding up in the bracket"
859370,pidge,2014-06-19 04:20:00,438,Ahh good idea Gerritt! Will do when I get back up there. Thanks man for the tip.Transducer looks to be in its normal position. I'm not sure what you mean Paudash of it riding up in the bracket. Do you mean kinda on a 45 degree angle?
859371,NANUK,2014-06-19 04:25:00,797,"Most likely the transducer is pooched, common problem with lowrance transducers after a couple of years use."
859372,pidge,2014-06-19 04:28:00,438,Thanks Stonefish. Didn't know that with them.
859378,Sinker,2014-06-19 07:21:00,8692,"Were there other boats close by you? Could have been interference from other units near by.....if not, yeah, id say your transducer is pooched.  S."
859383,Cosmos,2014-06-19 11:23:00,588,Had exactly same experience with my humminbird couple years ago. I had to replace transducer.
859388,pidge,2014-06-19 11:48:00,438,No boats in the areas Sinker. Thanks. And thanks Costa. Ill start with replacing the transducer.
859391,BillM,2014-06-19 11:57:00,17367,Unhook the transducer and put the unit into demo mode. If the lines are still there it is a problem with the head unit/LCD screen. If they disappear then I would suspect the transducer as the culprit.  G  Yup.  Great advice Gerritt.
859394,Terry,2014-06-19 12:08:00,14456,Yup most likely the ducer The newer lowrance units don't have that problem. Only the older ones.
859473,pidge,2014-06-19 21:42:00,438,Thanks Terry
859569,fisherman7,2014-06-20 12:00:00,325,had the same problem with mine. Something had chewed the wires.
859579,BillM,2014-06-20 12:32:00,17367,had the same problem with mine. Something had chewed the wires.  Damn Atlantics.
