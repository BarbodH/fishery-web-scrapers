I respect them greatly but I'm not gonna lose any sleep over filleting a few. When i do feel bad is when i deep hook a smallie through the gills and have to keep it. My wife says "" whats for supper""?  ""Ummm, mud?"" Lol."

859572,Dave Bailey,2014-06-20 12:11:00,1641," I think you're right about fish (no conscience at all, more ""instinctual"" than thinking), but elephants, dolphins, whales, primates, and even pigs are a lot more sentient than you're giving them credit for.  I give them a lot of credit for intelligence, but until they can be shown to have the ability to, as I said, communicate complex and abstract ideas, I doubt that they understand what death is. In the meantime, I would say that society should go out of its way to treat them humanely, just in case. They definitely have emotions, nobody will convince me that they don't."
859585,cram,2014-06-20 12:53:00,1733," I give them a lot of credit for intelligence, but until they can be shown to have the ability to, as I said, communicate complex and abstract ideas, I doubt that they understand what death is. In the meantime, I would say that society should go out of its way to treat them humanely, just in case. They definitely have emotions, nobody will convince me that they don't. Elephants, dolphins, gorillas, etc certainly/absolutely mourn their dead, and it is believed they have some understanding of mortality.  I'm not sure what you consider communicating complex and abstract ideas, but dolphins, whales, and chimps teach one another how to use tools, or different hunting strategies. It's believed they communicate this, and learn.  The part of the brain responsible for a lot of this is the neocortex.  We have a big and complicated one.   Fish don't even have one.  Even if they feel pain, they likely don't perceive or ponder it like we do.  Anyone who's had a dog experience death has seen them mourn. As for the P3TA comment above from Manitoubass.....i think pigs are very smart, but know i""ll be bbq'ing a few racks of ribs tomorrow afternoon."
859591,MrSimon,2014-06-20 13:18:00,217,"I see animals as a resource created by God and placed on this Earth to be respected and cared for .... but also to be used.  Use can include transportation, food, companionship, as well as sport and recreation.  The resource is there to be used, but not abused.  We are to be good stewards of what we've been given and treat animals responsibly.  Its all about balance.  With that said though, I do not believe animals have 'rights' and I don't buy into Uncle Ted's whole 'honor your quarry' stuff.  So to the OP ... I don't know if fish feel pain or not.  Its pretty darn clear that they don't like being hooked and ripped out of the water ...... but to be completely honest, I don't care.  I fish because I love it, regardless of how the fish feels.  There are WAY more important things in life to focus on than whether or not a fish feels pain."
859595,craigdritchie,2014-06-20 13:33:00,1586,"Hooked in the mouth, fish do not feel what we would call ""pain"" because the requisite nervous structure simply doesn't exist. A bass or pike eating perch or sunfish clamps down on spiny dorsal fins every single day without a second thought. I wince when a bluegill nails me with one of its spines, but the bass doesn't even feel it. If fish felt pain, those bass and pike would never eat.  Do you feel pain when you cut your hair or your fingernails? It's no different. The nervous structure to sense ""pain"" simply doesn't exist in those parts of the body.  Hook a fish somewhere other than inside the mouth and I don't know the answer. I'm not aware of any research on whether a fish snagged in the back senses discomfort. I don't know that anyone has ever studied it.  Fish ""fight"" because they resist the force of us dragging them through the water. They feel the drag of the line and they react to it. If you just hit the free-spool in mid fight, more often than not the fish will settle down and go right back to what it was doing before. It only starts resisting again when you resume trying to haul it into the boat. Try it. The fish may continue to scrap because it has a mouth full of Zara Spook and can't close its yap ... but most of the time they settle down pretty quickly."
859596,BillM,2014-06-20 13:34:00,17367,You can absolutely put me in the 'respect your quarry' boat.   We also know chinooks are terrified of marshmellows.

Why, because someone determined that it is cruel to torture a fish by catching it, then releasing it to do it all over again. Obviously they thought fish feel pain. At least they didn't ban fishing outright."
859676,Terry,2014-06-20 20:22:00,14456,same European countries think it is better to use oil based products then a renewable resource like beaver pelts  and god forbid you kill a seal  but they still eat their steak and carp

859475,Shloim,2014-06-19 21:49:00,515,Ok so my wife is saying that fish feel slot more pain than we think or care to admit.  Thoughts ?
859476,Terry,2014-06-19 21:59:00,14456,"they have done studies P3ta even paid for a study, then tried to bury it because fish do not feel pain like mammals do..and that is what the studies showed their nervous system is not developed enough to transmit pain  they also do not experience fear,"
859477,Rod Caster,2014-06-19 22:03:00,5784,"They probably feel 'something', but it's normal for them as a survival mechanism. Imagine a walleye laying into a perch or several perch with those big sharp dorsal fins. That's gotta hurt more than a jig head. The walleye doesn't care or was designed to deal with that pain, move on and catch another meal. Their nervous system is completely different than ours so to compare a fish to human is not coherent.  Also, my dog certainly feels pain, but I've seen him smash into so many things day in day out (he's not very smart, or hard or seeing) and he walks away like nothing happened. Nature is made to withstand a lot of stress, humans by comparison are soft and weak, which is why our bodies have a low threshold for pain, which is also why we have the brain to create external protections."

859485,Gallie,2014-06-19 22:22:00,1215,"I have struggled with this idea in the past, i dont believe they feel pain like we do but definitely feel something. I generally oversize my equiptment for the job at hand so that im not exhausting the fish to death as well. I like to make the experiance as painless and as efficient as possible for the fish. As fishing is far and above my favourite hobby/passion/obsession, i wont be quitting any time soon so i do the best i can."
859487,glen,2014-06-19 22:26:00,2641,Think of how happy a fish is when it's set free instead of eaten.
859490,spincast,2014-06-19 22:39:00,3279,ever play rugby? Hurts but never stopped me. Sure they feel something - every nervous system responds to stimuli. Does it hurt? Not enough to cause harm

859502,Ralph Field,2014-06-19 23:50:00,1018,I agree with those that believe that fish don't experience the same sort of pain that humans do. They do however build up lactic acid in their system as they are fought which can lead to their death after a prolonged fight with a fisherman using too light a line for the targeted species. Land fish as quickly as possible if you practise catch and release.
