I'd seen the place featured on several shows over the years; Fish'n Canada, Fish TV & most recently on Canada In The Rough. All shows gave it stellar reviews. I had to check it our for myself.  The fishing looks amazing, accommodations awesome & the owners are very friendly (met them at the Toronto Sportsman Show).  Now to the important part.   THE FISHING !!  I'm looking for any tips for that body of water you can offer please.  The lodge is located on Kabinakagami Lake, commonly known as ""Kaby Lake"". I have a few GPS points the shows mentioned, but more info is always better than less.  Thanks in advance and I'll be sure to post a full report once I'm back.  Thanks! Bassive @PescaInCanada"

I almost went back there this year, but chose another place.   It's a nice lake.  I have a compiled list of spots from who knows where...probably surfing the various forums....so I don't know how good it is.  I never manage to get to most of the spots myself.  Most probably aren't relevant for fishing in May anyway.
