Yes, there is another side to that too such as worker abuse and so forth in such places.But can we turn that around? Not likely with the state of mind of workers here.There is also way too much red tape hiring people. I'd love to hire more, but the costs to hire someone is prohibitive.

Well, with the way things are going I'll have to work until the day I die because I wasn't smart enough to get into politics so I could have a huge pension. Must be nice, work two terms, get a penson for life (at who's expense)?  I was always too busy working and trying to make ends meet and feed my family. In my case as with many others we didn't have jobs that came with comfy pension plans and we couldn't afford to put money into pensions. It took everything we earned to feed our families and pay our taxes so we could some day get to enjoy our CPP and old age pensions.  Turns out the government squandered all that money we paid into them so that now they want even more money with the promise that we will someday be able to retire with a pension we can exist on. BULL SPIT!  I saw friends this past winter that had a choice: eat, freeze, or go into debt on their credit cards (which they can't afford to pay anyway). This is Canada for christ sake, we can send billions of $ in aid to other countries but let our own people suffer? Where is the logic in that?  In the meantime billions of $ are getting pissed up the wall by people that I can assure you will never have to worry about going hungry because they just take what ever they want. Unlike Robin Hood, they take from the poor and give to themselves!  I would start a revolution if I knew how but I don't! I would love to know how, and have the energy to make the people that spend our money accountable! Saddly I am lacking on both counts!  We need some young people with the brains and energy to get this going, I would be one of the first to get involved, do nothing, you deserve what you end up with and your kids are left with or at least try!

858428,cram,2014-06-14 23:28:00,1733," I agree Horwath was put in a no-win situation over the budget. Wynne tabled such a ridiculous farce of a budget there's absolutely no way anyone with half a brain could support it, and Wynne knew that. Horwath didn't force the election, Wynne did - by tabling a nonsense budget that she knew would be thrown out. I guess we'll know for sure when she brings out her new budget next month. Will it be the same thing all over? Or will this one be tempered to reflect reality? My guess is it will be toned down considerably, because now she has to make it work.  It was a risky move, but I guess the Liberals felt their best chance was to force an election now while the Conservatives were still split over leadership and the trade unions were miffed at the NDP. The timing was definitely in their favour. Still ... it was a manipulative and underhanded move, IMHO.  And yes, I do think political discussion has a (limited) place on a fishing forum.  If we can have 256-page threads devoted to hockey, why not discuss things that directly impact our ability to afford to go fishing?? Or that potentially impact MNR's funding? You realize that the governing party can just call an election, right?   They didn't need a non confidence vote.  In fact, I think Wynne pre-empted the vote by calling an election in advance.  She put that budget forward to get the NDPs to keep them in power.  Same reason she added taxes to her budget last year (to get the NDP onside).  It didn't work and we went to an election anyway,  and the rest is history.  The one good thing out of them having a majority is they won't have to appease the NDP to get anything passed through. Hopefully that means they'll dial back a little bit."

Sorry I was unclear, among other things I do the payroll and forget most don't have to deal with it.  I meant over the year but that is just if you making about $30,000 per year, it obviously goes up from there and like CPP (max $2,425.50 for 2014) it seems to have a maximum at around $2000 but I haven't found it.  So if you are making $40,000 it is $760 and to a max.there goes $2000 a year people can't pay off on the mortgage, credit cards, RRSP, RESP, TFSA....  What you get back will be based on what you put in too so it will probably be annoying what you get back if you are over 40.

Reducing 100,000 through attrition over the 8 years would have had no impact on service and assuming a paycheque of $40,000 average and there is $4,000,000,000 without covering seating, benefits etc."
858373,Big Cliff,2014-06-14 18:51:00,6899,"Not to pick on anyone but this is a real example:  A couple of days ago I was headed into work (yes, at 68 I still have to work!) There were 4 hydro trucks parked on the side of the road. One of them flagged me down to ask if I knew how to get a turtle off the road (no, it is true) I got out, picked the turtle up carried it to the side of the road. Meanwhile, there are no less than 8 hudro workers standing around, turns out they had to cut down one tree. My understanding is that these guys start at $38.00/hour X 8.  Now I wonder how many hours I have to work just to pay for them to cut down one tree?  I have seen street lights installed for ""friends"" that never got a bill for them and never will, but you and I are paying for it.  It doesn't stop there: Walk/don't walk lights installed at intersections on highways where there is no foot traffic? What idiot authorized those and how much are you and I paying for each of them?  Speed signs: 60 ends,   20' further down the road, 80 begins  ya think?  It takes a smart hard working person to run a successful business; it seems that only an idiot gets to run a country!  It's time Canada became a business and was run like a business. You don't produce, your fired!"
858376,misfish,2014-06-14 18:59:00,29133,"Thought I told you to go fishing?  I did,and never gave the election a thought.  I seen deer,wild turkeys. Got me thinking about this falls hunt.

Well, as you can tell, I am far from happy! The fact that I have grandkids and now great grandkids that are going to have to live with the mess that we allow to happen saddens me no end.

It just blows my mind how the people voted for such a corrupt party last night.  I will accept the out come and by more lube, going to be bent over a lot in the next 4 years I'm afraid.  You might be right Joe and well see them start slicing jobs and programs too.  Something has to be done to get the budget under control.  Higher taxes are looming I'd say."

HH  I agree Horwath was put in a no-win situation over the budget. Wynne tabled such a ridiculous farce of a budget there's absolutely no way anyone with half a brain could support it, and Wynne knew that. Horwath didn't force the election, Wynne did - by tabling a nonsense budget that she knew would be thrown out. I guess we'll know for sure when she brings out her new budget next month. Will it be the same thing all over? Or will this one be tempered to reflect reality? My guess is it will be toned down considerably, because now she has to make it work.  It was a risky move, but I guess the Liberals felt their best chance was to force an election now while the Conservatives were still split over leadership and the trade unions were miffed at the NDP. The timing was definitely in their favour. Still ... it was a manipulative and underhanded move, IMHO.  And yes, I do think political discussion has a (limited) place on a fishing forum.  If we can have 256-page threads devoted to hockey, why not discuss things that directly impact our ability to afford to go fishing?? Or that potentially impact MNR's funding?"

Hudak is paying for his 100 000 and Million Jobs mistake. When economists call out your plan and you argue it, then your plan is doomed to go down in flames.

We also gained the freedom to not vote if we so choose, especially if none of the candidates are deemed acceptable to me.  I choose to decline my vote based upon this.

Read it, show it to friends who aren't clued in, share it far and wide. Be sure to give Marilyn credit for the list when you share.  This is the last time I will be posting my list of Liberal scandals. The choices are clear between the two leading parties. A vote for the Liberals is a vote to pay more taxes, receive fewer services, have money taken from your wallet and put into the wallets of the Liberals and their union friends, to condone the continuance of Liberal theft and corruption and to watch Ontario go completely bankrupt. A vote for the Conservatives is a vote to not pay any new taxes, to have your income taxes reduced once the budget is balanced, to have more services, to see a reduction in the size of the Liberal's newly-created bloated bureaucracy and to watch Ontario get on the road to economic recovery. If you care about your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren and are concerned about the massive debt the Liberal's have already saddled them with, don't vote Liberal.

When store in Toronto were required to charge for bags, the five cents was retained by the store.  Some stores still choose to charge five cents per bag, but there is no legal requirement for them to do so.   I do not think that changing immigration will make us that much better off;  Immigration is federal issue; this is a provincial election."

Almost every time there is a democratic election here or down south the margin is 2% or less between victory and defeat. The most important vote for these politicos is from the person that doesn't vote by many means, declined ballot, spoiled ballot or not showing up at all. Like I always say a black man won a US election that had a Muslim name and zero political experience compared to both those he beat, not once but twice! How? By getting 2% of those that don't vote to vote for him. There is no way 2% of Republicans suddenly thought it was time for a Black President, and a Democrat at that! It was the 2% made up as first time voters, students and those that felt they were always too stupid, frightened or poor to make a difference."

I am not sure what you have against that.  He is not claiming that this alone will resolve all of Ontario's problems.   Public service cuts will not all be attrition - when he cancels full day kindergarten how many teachers and ECE will lose their jobs? When he cancels the amount of programs and projects he has to in order to balance the budget and provide corporate tax cuts that he has planned do you not think that will effect employment somewhere along the lines as well?  That does not necessarily require any teachers to be fired.  Teachers retire every year; that is why about 2,500 new teachers are hired every year.  We also have a number of ""retired"" teachers who continue to work as supply teachers.  The reduction can be achieved by reducing or eliminating new hires for the four implementation of his plan.  Yes, this will impact employment because fewer people will be hired.  The ones currently in teacher's college will find it even more difficult to get into teaching.  But it does not mean the current teacher need to be fired.     5 cent tax - I know in Ottawa most stores I go to still charge it, if they continue to does it not make sense for it to be used towards environmental programs? or ensure all stores cancel it outright.  No, I do not think it makes sense for the money currently charged by stores to be used for the environment.  As I said, there is not, nor has there ever been a provincial law that requires stores to charge five cents per bag.  Toronto did have such a law at one time; but that has since been eliminated.  If other cities require a charge per bag, then you need to take that issue up with the city; not the province.  In order to use a per bag charge for provincial government expenditures on the environment, a tax would have to be created, administered, audited, and enforced.  This may have some merit.  But it would require a bureaucracy to be created to administer the tax.  I am not sure how much money would be left over after the administration costs were taken into consideration.  I also do not agree with forcing stores to cancel their policies of charging per bag.  Stores have always been allowed to charge for bags it they wanted to.  It was common practice for discount stores to charge for bags.  I think stores should be allowed to charge for providing bags if they choose to do so.  Consumers have the option of shopping at other stores if this bothers them."

The true beauty of a Harper majority is that we won't have another federal election for 4 years!  To answer the question, no.  If for no other reason I hope it's PC majority so we don't have to endure yet another election in the coming year or two.  Add to that the money wasted on the gas plant...it's mindboggling the costs we taxpayers are saddled with.  Regardless of the issues, this alone is enough to vote PC."

Also, keep in mind that the ""Hudak will fire 100,000 government workers"" filth the Liberals keep repeating is totally untrue and it's not like those people will be fired the second the Conservatives win. It will take years for those 100,000 jobs to be cut as the plan is to avoid hiring someone to fill that position after the initial employee retires. They're not going to fire those 100,000 people, they're just not going to hire anyone to fill those positions. Service has not increased since those 100,000 positions were created and services will not be effected as it will take years to phase out those positions."

When he cancels the amount of programs and projects he has to in order to balance the budget and provide corporate tax cuts that he has planned do you not think that will effect employment somewhere along the lines as well?    There are already far too many ECE's in Ontario due to the government paying to put so many of them through school when there was a need for more ECE's. So many in fact that school boards (where most ECE's want to work because of $$$ and benefits) often receive hundreds of applications when they post that a job is available. There are so many ECE's out there that daycares can offer to pay low wages ($12/hr) and still have people fighting over the position.    By cutting corporate taxes, the result will be lower operating costs to operate in Ontario which in turn will attract more businesses and create jobs. On the flip side, the liberals have cost Ontario over 300,000 jobs since 2003 and all their green act has done is put the province deeper into debt, made hydro very expensive, and encouraged businesses to leave Ontario."
