859602,Big Cliff,2014-06-20 14:13:00,6899,"Paul, AKA Mercman on here has come to my rescue several times now. He has guided me through repairs to a fridge, freezer, (which without his help would have cost me a lot of money) parts for a dishwasher that no one else could find and he keeps sending them to me at his cost!  Paul my friend, I really appreciate what you have done for me (and I suspect many other members of this board). There are OFCr's then there are OFC members!  Thank you so much for all you have done for me and I hope we can get together one day soon, you must be one heck of a good man and I would love to spend some time with you!  Sincerly!  Big Cliff"

859682,John,2014-06-20 20:41:00,2956,"I am a big believer that most times in this life you reap what you sow and in general you are treated as you treat others. There are many on here that help, some with small acts of kindness, some go way beyond need or expectation, without any thought or want for acknowledgement or reward. Kudo's to all of you, you know who you are. That's what makes this place special and different and a community....just sayin'"
859693,spincast,2014-06-20 21:32:00,3279,Paul's a good man. Help anyone and never ask anything in return.
