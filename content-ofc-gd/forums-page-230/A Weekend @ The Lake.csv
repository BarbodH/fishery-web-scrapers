860030,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-24 03:51:00,10439,Spent the Aboriginal Day long weekend up @ my lease setting up camp and working on my dock. Camp is set up @ the back of the lease beside where the cabin is going.    Got the dock ramp in place but I have decided it needs to go lower down on the rock. Drilled new holes for the anchors and picked up new anchors on the way home today.    Also started work on the main dock. Hope to get it ready to go in next weekend and then with a buddies help I will get it in on Canada Day.    A long shot from off shore. You can't even see the camp from the water.
