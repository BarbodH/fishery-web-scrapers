It all fell through on Thursday when two out of the four of us have had to cancel due to work to repair broken power lines. They make a killing on OT during these terrible times and are almost required to work.  Soooo, Ive got no boat and will have to fish from shore.  My question  Can anyone please suggest a place I could fish (Bass) from shore in the lower Kawarthas?"

I specialize in shore fishing and I have youtube channel if you want to check out all the different shore fishing areas. www.youtube.com/wheretofish  Also my website is almost ready, wtfontario.ca  To answer your question, I would try Canal Lake in Kirkfield,ON. There's a long stretch of road that cuts right through the lake and you have a long stretch of shore line on both sides of the lake that cuts into two. The West side is more choppy waters and it's deeper and the east side is more weedy and calm.  Don't forget to subscribe!  -Where to fish"
