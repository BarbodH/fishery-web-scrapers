It was only a matter of time, I suppose, as the Cisco population on the lake is coming back, as icefisherman have noticed the last few seasons.  The Ministry sites habitat improvements, which is good news.  Not being able to target them must have helped, too, and this limited harvest sounds pretty reasonable to me.      "

You could send in an email with your input, however there is no ""comment section"" when it comes to MNR requesting input."
