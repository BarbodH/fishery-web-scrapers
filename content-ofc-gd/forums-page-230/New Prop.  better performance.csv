Lund 17.5 ft.    Original prop 13.25 x 17P  3 blade  Holeshot was slow fully loaded and WOT 6200 lightly loaded.  Jamie at Kawartha Prop in Buckhorn  recommended a Solas 12.75 in 17p  4 blade prop  Better hole shot.  Drops RPM from 4000 rpm to 3500 rpm at 20 mph.  Top speed down to 41 from 42  WOT 5800.  I am happy.  Very helpful at Kawartha Prop.  $173.    (Canadapropeller.com  $149 + $25 delivery)  At Kawartha, they said I can exchange to a different one if not happy.  great service.  "

Getting the boat up on plane efficiently and having a good cruise speed/rpm is more imprtant than your top speed which for intensive purposes is the same. You will burn less fuel getting the boat to plane and will burn less while cruising. Now, get some slime all over her!!!"
