860237,captpierre,2014-06-25 03:04:00,2521,casting jigs all weekend.  My new Symetre's bale flips back on it's own from the movement of a hard cast.  Happens maybe 5-10% of the time.  sudden stop to that cast and wasted time.  Anybody know how to fix this problem?
860239,Sinker,2014-06-25 03:26:00,8692,Dont cast as hard?  I dunno....you think its a faulty bail? Take it in to shimano and let them have a look at it.  S.
860252,bushart,2014-06-25 11:30:00,2628,In May--my brother showed up with a brand new Symetre---straight outta the box  He had a different bail issue---he'd cast----turn the handle and the bail would only half close  I figured the pivot screw was a bit too tight----small screwdriver--backed it off ever so slightly---problem solved  Maybe yours is Too Loose??---something to look at maybe---just don't get crankin too hard on that screw
