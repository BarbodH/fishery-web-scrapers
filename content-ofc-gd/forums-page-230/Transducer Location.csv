You don't like marking rock humps, etc when running around the lake?  Sure it's not 100% exact, but it's way better then trying to line up boat houses and islands, lol."
859946,misfish,2014-06-23 19:17:00,29133,  LMAO Bill  Thats how I mark my trout line. It never fails.    Terry excellent gizmos make it a lot easier though.
859949,davey buoy,2014-06-23 19:32:00,5505,"It's still fairly clear,Just thought it was a setting.Has quad beams clear as heck,flasher,all the good stuff.Someone said sensitivity?.With the power of this I'm thinking it should be a tad clearer while running.I'm getting a rooster tail,does that mean it should be lower than half way?It's slightly down at the back ever so slightly.Thanks guys for your help again."

859275,davey buoy,2014-06-18 19:41:00,5505,"I know it isn't rocket science but have fooled around with it a bit the last couple evenings.Used a square to find the straight angle to the location from the upper trim of the boat.Does it really matter if it is mostly in the water flow?,not half way. I do realize it will be more prone to be hit by debris but is lower the better if you will, the best/accurate readings?. Where it is mounted the transducer is straight.The bottom of the boat where it is mounted is slanting up and out for stability. I hope this makes sense,it is not a square bottom boat.Stepped v's might be more accurate. Thanks guys for any info.   Dave.  "
859276,Sinker,2014-06-18 19:44:00,8692,"As long as its in a steady flow of water, it should be fine. You might get a little spray coming off it if its a bit low, but it should still work.  Hopefully there are no air bubbles passing under it from the ""slanting out and up"" part of the boat, that may cause bad readings on plane. Too low could cause this as well.  S."

859294,wallyboss,2014-06-18 20:33:00,1095,"Go for a boat ride with a buddy and get him to look at the back of the boat when you are on plane and see where the water comes out nice and smooth and mount your transducer in that spot. Mine was first installed in one spot that looked fine until I looked at it while somebody else was driving the boat and it was full of bubbles right where the transducer was, i moved it about 5-6"" and now its in a very smooth area and it sure cleaned up my sonar readings."
859295,Bill Shearer,2014-06-18 20:35:00,456,"I always had mine tilted to the stern more, so that I could watch the down riggers , and the fish that were attracted to the baits. Turbulance created by this 'negative' tilt was an issue at speed. I could get depth but not fish. If you don't need to see that, then the thing to consider the most is not if the bottom of the transducer is square to the transom, or parallel to the bottom of the boat, but parallel to the bottom of the lake when the boat is at rest. If you can stand in shallow water with a level on the bottom of the transducer, you can get it bang on."

859299,davey buoy,2014-06-18 20:42:00,5505,"Thanks guys,just used a level as a straight edge under the boat and out the back.Clicked it back up one notch and it shows the front half,1/2 way below the bottom tilting slightly down to about 3/4 below the boat.I think I'm now in the sweet spot.Optical allusion because of the trailer nose being so high.Now none of the transducer is 100% below the bottom."

Thanks Brian,thinking it will be ok.,Working Thursday, Friday looks like a Sat 5:30 am start working or not lol.Still have my fishin buddy if need to hone in on the catch  .No air bubbles,things should be good.Feeling better it's not 100% below the bottom."
859308,Sinker,2014-06-18 21:28:00,8692,On my boat the transducer is tilted up at the back for best results. Trial and error is the best way now. Its easy enough to adjust.  S.

859767,davey buoy,2014-06-21 19:18:00,5505,"Tried the finder worked awesome,a couple questions ,When I start to speed up I get I get a grainy look on the display.I can see fish,bottom depth temp without any hesitation.Would there be a setting that may clear that up while moving?It's a 718x humminbird. Secondly,forgot to shut it off in the water.Noticed when clearing the boat at the ramp.Shut it off of course.Can't really think that would hurt  as I'm sure everyone has done this at one point and probably a lot longer.

Found a interesting read,they say no damage at all when on out of water.The same transducers are used for shoot thru hulls with no water cooling at all.I guess years ago they heated up a lot,but from what I am now uderstanding no issues."
859899,doubleheader,2014-06-23 14:47:00,497,"You didn't mention how fast you were going when it started to get 'grainy"", but there really isn't much you can do. Recognize that the faster you go the more ""stuff"" is getting pinged from your transducer, so yea, you can turn the sensitivity down, but then what are you going to see?? If you're only looking for depth you would be okay, but whether or not you'll be able to pick up fish who knows. You just have to experiment, but the faster you're going the narrower the arc will be."

859919,BillM,2014-06-23 16:32:00,17367,"Sensitivity really doesn't matter.  If the angle of the transducer is different when you're on plain, you'll never get a good reading if you're going fast.    That's the problem with the old transducer mounts, they're fixed.   The one that came with my 898C pivots just a wee bit which gives me great readings even when I'm going WOT.  Try to find a decent balance between both."
