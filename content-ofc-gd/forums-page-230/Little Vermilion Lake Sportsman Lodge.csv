860005,Whopper,2014-06-24 01:42:00,2174,Thanks for the comments folks. We take a great deal of pride in catching and releasing the big pike LV has to offer. It was a good trip spent with some good people.  Cheers
858835,Whopper,2014-06-16 20:35:00,2174,"Johnson Silver Minnow that is.   A little bigger  A lot bigger   The fish above were all caught on a silver Johnson Silver Minnow with a four inch pearl white twister tail. These and many others were caught on 6/2/14. My boat partner and private photographer was the famous ""TennesseeGuy""  Connie Inman.   The fishing was great. The fresh walleye dinners were fantastic. Spending a week in NWO is priceless.  Cheers"

858917,Joeytier,2014-06-17 02:45:00,3990,Okay well you lived up to your username good lord!!
858948,BillM,2014-06-17 12:36:00,17367,Nice gators!  Any measurements taken?
858970,TennesseeGuy,2014-06-17 14:26:00,957,"BillM, no measurements.    Fish were out of the water for only a few seconds.   Big net, but no cradle which would have allowed for checking length.   Most of our fish were released without being netted.    Many were unhooked in the net and swam away when the net was pulled away from them.   All of our pike were caught on single hooks (jigs and JSM).    I tried Suicks, but pike weren't eating Suicks that week.  For the 3 photos the fish were unhooked in the net, taken out of the water about 20 seconds for a photo and then back to the net to be sure they were fully recovered before pulling the net from under them.  Nothing touched our fish except for wet hands.  Over the years I've seen several silver pike, but Phil's is probably the largest I've seen.   She didn't have any holes in her mouth from previous hooks.  We managed to bring in several nice pike every day.  I'm missing NW Ontario.    Will probably be back up there next month."
