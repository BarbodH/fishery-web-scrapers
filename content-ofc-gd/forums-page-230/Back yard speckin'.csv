859173,Rod Caster,2014-06-18 02:48:00,5784,"My Brother and I took to the ATV's to travel the first 600m of trails, then took to foot as we walked down the not-yet-trailed escarpement leading to the small river that crosses a large section of my property. Twice we made the trip this year. Both times the skitters, blackflies and friggen no-see-ems were out in full force; both times the specks were bitting!  We had great action the first time, at the peak of blackfly season, averaging 11 inch specks with a few 14 inch specks mixed in. This time we hit the river during a strong rainfall, the action wasn't as hot, but we came home with two 13 inchers.     This girl attacked both my ATV and my dog.   Oh, and here's my new catch. 9 day old girl! I just have to comment on how amazing mom's are... all the bush work and employement work I do pales in comparison to the amount of effort, concentration and strength it takes to be a nursing mom (and at every other stage I'm sure).  "
859178,Sinker,2014-06-18 04:25:00,8692,Congrats on the new arrival!   The specks aint too shabby either!  S.
859185,chris.brock,2014-06-18 07:31:00,4053,"awesome new addition to the family, congrats  I've heard an old timer say that the brookie bite is best at the height of black fly season  I can't make out what attacked your bike, ruffed grouse?  edit- oh yeah, your back yard looks a lot better than mine"
859188,solopaddler,2014-06-18 08:45:00,8605,"Outstanding, congratulations! And I agree with you about moms."

859259,Musky or Specks,2014-06-18 18:21:00,2710,Told you the worse the black flies the better the spec fishing I was worried you weren't going to get out with the new baby. Congrats on both specs in the back yard and a new daughter.
859298,Joey,2014-06-18 20:41:00,9122,Congrats on your new daughter.  She'll grow up to be a fine fishergal I'm sure
859301,Moosebunk,2014-06-18 20:47:00,3970,"Congrats man.  In the future, once your daughter is up and running around on her own, leave the heads on those specks when you fry 'em up.  She'll love that."
859315,gino,2014-06-18 21:56:00,400,"Congratulation, Chad! Now, your life changes completely...in a good way. I have 2 children already, and the 3rd one is on his/her way...great kids, loved them to death. And yes, mom job is a full time job, the most challenging and rewarding also...Enjoy the time, they grow fast.."
859327,NAW,2014-06-18 23:21:00,4022,Wicked report Chad!! The kid looks cute!!  And your bang on about moms..  It ain't easy for the first bit ..
859361,Rod Caster,2014-06-19 02:45:00,5784,"  I can't make out what attacked your bike, ruffed grouse?   Yup. Glad to see them now, but I'll be ever happier to see them in the fall!  NIce 'specs - to have them in your backyard..... Great shot of you and Abby! Way to go It's quite a jaunt to get there, no trails down to the water and across the river I have 15 or so acres I've never walked on. I've been working on widening my existing trails and grooming the hardwoods; at some point I'll make a walking trail (s) down to the river. It's not easy terrain!  Told you the worse the black flies the better the spec fishing I was worried you weren't going to get out with the new baby. Congrats on both specs in the back yard and a new daughter. Yup, a much better average size this time of year. I need to haul the waders down and spend a good day exploring the river. If you ever add this river to your 'to do' list, let me know; I have a great location for some camping and free breakfasts!"
859373,Nipfisher,2014-06-19 04:52:00,2449,Congrats Chad and Sarah. I was wondering why I hadn't heard from you in a while.
