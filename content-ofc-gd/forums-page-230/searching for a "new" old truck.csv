Tons of torque to haul the boat around and the gas milage is incredible. I get better gas milage hauling the boat then I used to get with my eccoboost F150. I'm currently averaging 8.9l/100km combined. Nice and big inside to haul the family around and up to the cottage.  cheers"

They put the frontier axles on the full size titan and they are just problems unless you change the diff to a eaton trutrac. also in my reach they have brake judder problems and you need to get the newer larger rotors and pads to fix that. other that they seem to be a pretty solid truck. They are ""different"" its not one of the big 3 which is up my alley i just need to be different. and if i was buying new i would definitely be looking at the dodge ecodiesel or a new toyota."

For used full size 2009 and up ram hemi with 5 or 6 sp auto good on fuel all kinds of jam. Gmc chev line if trucks with there version of mds also decent on fuel both vehicles work well and can be had used under 20 k.

That one I loaned to a buddy of mine, who I ""THOUGHT"" knew how to drive a standard, and who drove it out of oil.  Then my wife drove it a hundred miles or so and told me afterwards that the oil light was on.  Blown engine, and that was a big old flat-head six if memory serves me.  Not Ford's fault.
