860280,fishnsled,2014-06-25 14:32:00,3520,I emailed a buddy of mine who is a bit of a collector and this was his reply.   Not much help I suppose but an avenue to explore.  Ties in with Floatman55's British Centerpin theory as well.

860294,Bill Shearer,2014-06-25 15:33:00,456,"The mystery continues. I sent the photos to John Milner who has made centerpins for many years. He said likely British, but could not provide more than that. Thanks for your efforts all!"
