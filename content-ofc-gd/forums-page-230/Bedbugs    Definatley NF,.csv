860136,esoxansteel,2014-06-24 19:14:00,1307,"Been in the Pest Control Industry for over 30 years, and with the Bedbug explosion thats currently taking place, and many of us planning summer holidays, a winter get away etc, i thought i would take a few lines to inform the members on what to look for, and how to minimize the risk of carrying these hitch hikers back home with you, and saving you thousands of dollars in discarded furniture and extermination fees etc.  A little pre-planning and home work will give you peace of mind, and make the trip more enjoyable  Step 1      When selecting a hotel, motel, resort etc,  check the guest review section on the locations website, there you will find if theres been any issues with Bedbugs, from there the management can respond to the guest complaints regarding Bedbugs, ie what they have done to prevent, etc, but they do not have the ability to remove those complaints regarding Bedbugs.  Step 2    Always pack a flashlight to inspect the room before acceptance, and before unpacking if you must  Step 3    Bedbugs feed on blood, and live on or within the bed, and usually within 5 feet on either side of the bed, which would encorporate the 2 end tables  Step 4    First with a fully charge flashlight, remove the headboard from the wall, which is usually attached by 2 to 3 screws into the wall, the headboard usually sits on a 1in by 2in slotted ledge as well. the headboard in most cases never gets removed, and is a favoured hiding place, for its security.     Next remove the matress, and boxspring from the bed frame, and remove the sheets, look at the seems of the mattress all the way around the perimeter, and pay special attention to each of the 4 corners.   Next another favored spot the boxspring, check the same way as the mattress, but also inspect the 4 plastic corner covers, by pulling the corner covers out to see behind, on both the mattress, and boxspring also inspect the carrying straps found on the sides as well, also check breathing or vent holes as well.  Next check the frame, and all parts of the frame, including the wheels, the posts that join the wheels to the frame, where the frame rails over lap each other, and also the holes in the frame for adjustment, and around the nuts and bolts. If every thing looks clear, visually check both end tables on each side of the bed,  check the back, and the back cover, as thats usually up against the wall, and remains relatively dormant with little movement,  Next check and open all drawers, inspect all upper corners, and also drawer slider rails, and also inspect all cracks and crevices of the end tables, and any screws as will checking the head where the screw driver would go, as bedbugs can commonly be found in that small #2 Robertson head if its made in Canada of course.  What to look for  obviously live insects indicate active present activity  also Bedbugs molt or shed their skin 5 times in there life before reaching adult hood, look for casted skins, also fecal marks or smears, which would look or resemble pepper grains, but unlike pepper grains which would be singular and loose, Bedbug fecal matter would be somewhat sticky and smear when rubbed or touched.  Also because Bedbugs feed on blood, blood smears on bedding would be another thing to look out for, but not something you wkill find as the Bedding would be changes before new guest arrive.  Personally i never really unpack, but work from a suitcase or night bag, get what i need then immediately zipper up, until something else is needed, hopefully this was informative"
860139,bushart,2014-06-24 19:20:00,2628,Good points LR   I Pray I never have to live that nightmare
860140,esoxansteel,2014-06-24 19:20:00,1307,"Also when you get home, DO NOT bring suitcases and clothing into the house, leave outside, or in the garage, and immediately place in sealed garbage bags, and go to the laundry mat to clean, if doing laundry at home, leave in garbage bags, and bring in sealed bags and empty directly into the washer with no sitting time on the floor, also high heat for 20 minutes will kill all stages of Bedbugs as well."
860142,hutch4113,2014-06-24 19:21:00,374,"Good post - wish I had seen a few year ago...lol. Can speak from experience - came back from a trip (Florida) and ended up having Bedbugs.  Tried to deal with it ourselves, but ended up calling pest control.  Best we can figure is the came in on our luggage - perhaps from contact with infected luggage at the airport. The place we stayed at did not have them.  All I can say - interesting experience for sure.  Wife carries a flashlight everywhere we go now.  We also make sure luggage is kept off the floor, and up high - and when possible on on any wood.  It takes about 5 minutes to do a good inspection. When we come back from a trip, we also quarantine our luggage before bringing it into the house.  Never want it to happen again.  The plus side on the Pest Control - we have zero bugs of any kind in the house now.."
