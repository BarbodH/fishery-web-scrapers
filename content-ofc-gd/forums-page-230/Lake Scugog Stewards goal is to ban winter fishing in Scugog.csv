Back then, sports fishing was something done by the wealthy and privileged. Most others caught fish as food. Fish were not play things, and they didn't go to waste. My grandfather would make the run to Simcoe, fill a bushel of whitefish and share them around when he got home. I was brought up on those same values. and yes I still view fish as food even though I do really enjoy the recreational part of it"
848290,jimmer,2014-04-16 18:06:00,2730,"I believe all issues listed in this thread have had an impact. Crappie, water levels and overharvesting. The overharvesting is still happening on the kawarthas and scugog got hit hard because of the ice fishing season. Many anglers still don't read the regulations or totally ignore them. I haven't done much fishing on Scugog lately because I live on Pigeon. A few years back, before the slot, I was getting totally disgusted with the stringers of 4-5 pounders hanging over the boats on opening day. Now many ignore the slot or don't even know it exists. I sure hope that the guys that said the walleye will bounce back are right!"
848292,Sinker,2014-04-16 18:13:00,8692,"They will.  The lakes can sustain a harvest, but they can't if there are year classes of fish that don't make it.

Anyway, this discussion was brought to my attention and I thought I would clarify some comments that were made, even though it has been over for a while.  I am with the Scugog Lake Stewards and it is NOT in our mandate to close the ice fishing season for all species.  However, we would like to see the ice fishing for Walleye to be closed in order to allow the population to recover.  There is a lot of pressure on the lake all year long and we believe the walleye population cannot withstand this constant pressure even with slot sizes.  There are only three areas in FMZ 17 that allow ice fishing for walleye, one section on the Trent which has very few walleye left and the Crowe Lake which also has few left.  These three location traditionally had walleye ice fishing season and when the new Zones were formed they kept that status, I assume it was like a Grandfather clause.  Regardless, there is plenty of MNR data that show a massive decline in walleye population, as well as data that suports a healthy walleye population could still be sustained because the lake conditions have not drastically changed like other lakes in the Kawarthas, i.e. Balsalm clearing up due to zebra mussels.  Please see the attached MNR document.  Thanks."
860128,esoxansteel,2014-06-24 18:31:00,1307,"This year many of the K Lakes have had very good walleye fishing, other then the traditional Rice and Sturgeon, goods numbers of varying year classes have come out of all of the Tri Lakes as well, Cameron also sports a healthy population, my theory and it may not be the right one is, Black Crappie in most of the K Lakes except Scugog, have came and peaked, and have returned to normal populations to co-exist with the other fish species, Black Crappie are most likely still increasing in population or are near the peak in Scugog, which should soon see a decline to acceptable numbers, maybe at that point Scugog will somewhat rebound as it appears other lakes have. Not to say Crappie were and are responsible 100% for the walleye decline in the K Lakes, but the numbers certainly did drop when they took hold, other factors certainly are environmental impact, and fluctuating water levels, with Scugogs makeup it should be a walleye factory. By closing the winter Walleye fishery, or the summer fishery which has also been discussed, it will not bring the numbers back as fast as one would expect, and it will not bring numbers back to the glory days as well, and thats why no decision has been made on Scugog, and why its still very  much in discussion at present."

Please see the attached MNR document.  Thanks.  Yep and they used the same arguement in 1997 when the Lake Wahwashkesh Conservation Association was succesful in closing off the lake.  Their angle was to apply to the MNR about creating a temporary fish sanctuary on the entire lake from Dec 1 to the middle of May due to the lack of lake trout.  Ice fishing is still closed and and that has not changed.  The fishing pressure on the Kawarthas is greater then it's ever been.  The stocks cannot naturally keep up with the pressure.  I don't care how many spawing beds are rehabilitated, they can't keep up.  The way I see it is they have 2 options (inside joke), first support the fishery with a massive stocking program.  Many of the local stakeholders should support the program, with either resources or funds.  Option #2 would be to run the Kawarthas in the same way as some of the ZEC's in Quebec are run, after a certain amount of fishing pressure the lakes are closed off to fishing."
860271,ty1on,2014-06-25 13:40:00,12,"I agree that the glory days are probably gone, however by doing nothing you are certain to have a further decline in the walleye population and by doing something there is hope that population can increase.  I have also heard from guys in Minnesota who have similar type lakes as Scugog that if you can get rid of the crappie and bring back the catfish, the walleye populations will increase?  They also have similar programs in Alberta where they will close down lakes and have been sucessful.  The reality is when they switched to the ""Zone"" model all lakes should have been closed off to ice fishing for walleye, afterall the reason that no other Kawartha lake had a winter fishery is because they could not withstand the pressure."

Only Lake Temagami had this Feb 15th to March 15th Laker season in the entire area and it was only brought upon from pressure from a cottage association that didn't want people fishing in front of their cottages when they weren't around to guard them. Said association had the ear of an MNR employee that happened to have a brother in the association and they changed the regulations without any scientific validation. When they combined a few zones into the new Zone 11 they made all the natural population lakes this same 1 month season, again without any science to back it up."

There is a lot of discussion on Scugog at FMZ17, and that discussion will continue, recruitment is the issue, there likely ARE enough spawning Walleyes left to sustain Scugog if they were spawning successfully and the young fish were entering the fishery, but that is not happening. To solve any issues you have to find the source, and to me personally closing the winter Walleye fishery will save some slot size Walleye from been harvested, but it wont bring back the numbers to what people remember, not even close, in fact it might not even be measurable, when the ongoing issue is recruitment  Just my 2 cents for what its worth"
