I have an HD TV but the one HDMI hook up id being used between Satellite and TV.  I was thing of hooking via component as far as video.  Question is, will it up convert IE 1080 or is it only possible with the HDMI outlet.  My questions are  Does up conversion really make a difference as far as picture compared to standard DVD Will it up convert via component I was looking at either Toshiba, Phillips, Samsung, and even RCA all from Wallymart, any recommendations And what exactly is Progressive scan  Remember I barely passed grade 8  Thanks"
