The Husband Store  A brand new store has just opened in New York City that sells Husbands. When women go to choose a husband, they have to follow the instructions at the entrance:- ""You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are 6 floors and the value of the products increase as you ascend the flights. You may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you CANNOT go back down except to exit the building!  So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband.  On the 1st floor the sign on the door reads:    Floor 1 - These men have jobs.  The 2nd floor sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.   The 3rd floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids and are extremely good looking.   ""Wow,"" she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.  She goes to the 4th floor and the sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help with Housework.  ""Oh, mercy me!"" she exclaims, ""I can hardly stand it!""  Still, she goes to the 5th floor and sign reads:    Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, help with Housework and Have A Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the 6th floor and the sign reads:   Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store .   To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opens a New Wives store just across the street.   The 1st floor has wives that love sex.  The 2nd floor has wives that love sex and have money.   The 3rd through 6th floors have never been visited."

120453,Fisherman,2007-10-03 23:35:00,7201,"That's too much information, I hope you've never been on any of the higher floors...."
120462,fishindevil,2007-10-04 00:07:00,6254,Good one braian !!!!!!!thanks for the laugh...LOL..LOL..LOL
120594,nelly,2007-10-04 12:28:00,256,That is so funny! Thanks to the both of you.
120601,wuchikubo,2007-10-04 13:02:00,1114,"Brian, thank you for the morning funny.  Chrome Hen, that may explain a bit more!"
120631,Squid,2007-10-04 14:24:00,1656,Good one Brian and nice addition there Chromer.
120708,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-04 22:03:00,1183,"Bunch of losers....LOL  you know that thing that happens to us unique women...you know...the curse...the nasties from the dark side that take over us....well...that's me right now...and I am itching for a fight....any takers, huh..anyone brave enough to stand up to a crazy woman....well if you are...I just want you to know that after you blast me...I am going to cry and you will feel really really bad.  Not to mention how really bad I am going to be feeling myself in a day or so, but right now...I don't give a carp.  Happy Thanksgiving...just curious how many of you MEN will be cooking the turkey.  Wives listen up....take control back and at least make the KING do the darn dishes...and get a massage too...or at least make him pay for one cuz we all know that he can't stay focused on the task.  aaaaahhhhhhh I feel better now."
120715,Fisherman,2007-10-04 22:49:00,7201,"Okay, stop walking or chewing...focus, focus, focus. The bird goes in the oven, the dishes go in the sink.  And we didn't put the undercut under the counters to hide the dust, they were put there to accomodate womens feet to get closer to the sink.  You know why wedding gowns are white?, goes well with the appliances.  Now I'll retire to the bomb shelter. Oh ya, I do cook the bird. Somehow they don't understand that if you sleep in and don't get the bird in the oven early enough, cooking the bird at 5ooC for 2 hours does not equal 325F for 5 hours."
120737,HTHM,2007-10-05 00:12:00,4082,"Seeing as how my wife reads this on occasion, I have to say that the third floor contains women just like her. Now I'm off the hook."
120751,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-05 01:20:00,1183,  uh hummmm....the third floor has never been visited...poor wife of yours.
