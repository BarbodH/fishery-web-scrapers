120191,mikeh,2007-10-03 01:30:00,824,"Last Thursday I decided I would go to Waubeshene and fish for some Musky, the forecast was for 5 km winds but I think the weatherman was wrong as you can tell by this first picture.I trolled until it became uncomfortable and then I went to an area with less wind.  this was the only Musky I caught this day, it was caught trolling going over a hump at about 12 feet deep,estimated the size to be about 32-36 inches.   I was trolling along at one point and as I passed over a hump I marked a fish sitting on the edge and figured it was a Musky so I reeled in and was going to go back for it and another boat trolled over the spot and caught a larger fish, I heard the guy tell his buddy it was a 50 inch fish. Can't wait to get back up there and maybe land one of those bigger ones. The next three pictures are water shots of the same fish as I was fishing alone and didn't take the fish out of the water.   "

120208,Pigeontroller,2007-10-03 02:33:00,2793,"Awesome to hear that you water released it! In 5-10 years it'll be a 50""er!"
120216,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-03 03:14:00,0,Nice Musky! I fished Waubashene form 7 years targetting pike and have only seen 3 Musky!! Though I always hear they are there.

120354,Zib,2007-10-03 17:39:00,369,"Nice pics. Georgian Bay has some big girls in there.  A friend of mine accidentally caught one that was 64"" in there about 10 years ago.  You should also try fishing Lake St. Clair. There's been a lot of musky over 50"" caught there this year."
120424,PAZE,2007-10-03 21:15:00,132," Im hopeing thats a typo, 64 incher in G-Bay would be a monster, and possible world record"
120491,fishindevil,2007-10-04 01:09:00,6254,Nice catch !!!!! great pics as well....cheers
120724,JerseyDog,2007-10-04 23:14:00,190,"50 inches won't do it on G. Bay. Minimum keeper size (why would you??) is 54""  Trophy waters.  Nice fish though."
