120738,fishindevil,2007-10-05 00:13:00,6254,Man you are verylucky !!!!!   i think they said e-bay there was a bidding war and ended up being 8 thousand bucks for 2 tickets......and yes they say the band led zepplica is a very close band to the real boys....there are comming to oshawa as well in a couple of weeks.....man i hope you enjoy that concert....ITS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT......cheers
120744,JerseyDog,2007-10-05 00:50:00,190,"Well let's be honest here. There is nothing VERY CLOSE to Zep. Not now, not ever. Maybe a good copy and  some good memories.  To this day, no one has got it that right, that perfect - s, d, rock & roll - the way it was supposed to be.  Best rock band ever - period."

120803,supernaut,2007-10-05 10:00:00,46,"The Wife says I should of played the lottery that day.. 24 million people registered for these tickets, the first day the website crashed. This is a One off concert that there doing for charity. Only 18 thousands seats out 24 million people who registered. They gave me 72 hours to decide if I wanted the tickets. Duh!."
120947,douG,2007-10-05 18:02:00,2693,"Amazing road trip in the making, there.  Rombo, I scooped top tickets for Neil at Massey Hall in November."
120954,ADC,2007-10-05 18:19:00,82,"  Hey, Ive seen Zepplica. Its awsome! you will enjoy!   However, HummingBird Centre? Not my first choice for a concert like that but, better than nothing.   Congrats on the tickets..... If I were you, I would probably sell them and buy a boat as you will get top $$ for them.   Ebay all the way!"
121005,keram,2007-10-05 20:03:00,585,"You are very lucky. One of the BEST band ever. I say ""One Of"" because there are few more I wish I could see again ( Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, Black Sabath, Deep Purple and my favorite Uriah Heep. Enjoy it."
