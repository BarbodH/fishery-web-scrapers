120913,lew,2007-10-05 17:16:00,12767,"Thanks Wayne, and congrats, it sounds like you guys had an awesome week and I'll be watching for your post when you get it up........you may as well ignore my PM  Sorry to hear about the family news, hope everything is OK"
120914,Whopper,2007-10-05 17:18:00,2174," Holy s**t Hit pay dirt my friend, can't wait for the report but I will"
120919,irishfield,2007-10-05 17:23:00,26272,"Don't want to hijack Lew's thread Phil....but we discussed it and determined it was just Good Karma ! Marc put up a tour for a good cause, I bought into the cause and we were shined on for doing so. Oh that and the bas tard knows where the fish hang out."
120931,Whopper,2007-10-05 17:44:00,2174,  Wayne I think Lew will make an exception this time   and if he doesn't I'm sure I will hear about Funny you mentioned the karma thing because I thought and said the same thing awhile back that you would get your just reward. Congrats bud!
120944,bassmaster4,2007-10-05 17:58:00,801,great pics nice skis
119332,Ron,2007-10-01 03:03:00,1683,Nice to see Lew. It just makes for a spectacular day.
119345,Raf,2007-10-01 05:47:00,3495,"WTG Lew, something about a plan coming together..   Sure seems like if a fish is there and active it doesn't take many casts to get them to go."
119348,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-01 08:10:00,1183,"Great report, nice fish.  I too was thinking...where is the smile?   lol"
119357,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 10:15:00,7971,Lew...some real beauties there!!!  Your instincts are amazing when it comes to these fish.  Those scenery shots were pretty cool too.  Thanks for the report!!
119374,Squid,2007-10-01 11:54:00,1656,Nice fish there Lew!! We could have used one of those on Saturday!
119382,Moosebunk,2007-10-01 12:06:00,3970,Crikey Lew.  That's putting the fish on the pattern eh???  Good shhhtuff indeed.
119385,bpsbassman,2007-10-01 12:11:00,941,"Fantastic Report Lew.  That first scenery shot is a beauty. Oh, by the way, nice fish!! Actually, that is a great tip to remember (moon & sun rise) whether you've previously located fish or not. I gotta rememeber that one. Thanks"
119421,lew,2007-10-01 13:43:00,12767,"Thanks everyone, good to hear you enjoyed the fish'n tale, it's always nice when a plan comes together.  I seldom post fish'n reports anymore, but every now & then I like to add one to the mix.   Weighted Suicks are an excellent bait Pete, and I've always got about a dozen in the boat, but in shallow weeds where these fish came from, a big spinnerbait is the best way to go. The fish are often sitting back in the heavy cover and it's the best way to get to them.    Sinker, yes, alot of the fish are up very shallow most of the year, but especially after dark, infact we get ALOT of nice muskies in as little as 2' of water after dark. A favorite spot is anywhere with plenty of sand and some sparce weeds mixed in, and if you can find some scattered rocks or old submerged tree stumps, even better."
119424,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-01 13:47:00,0,Nice Musky. Good to see that the Musky are starting to become active. Now if I can only get mark to get away from the pike lakes and fish a Musky lake!!
119428,Roy,2007-10-01 13:52:00,13728,"Two exceptional looking fish Lew. Way to go. I'm having camera issues too. Last night I went out and got a really nice muskie and when I uploaded to pics onto the computer, it looked like perch.....go figure.  Thanks for posting."
119430,lew,2007-10-01 13:53:00,12767," Actually JohnnyB, the musky fish'n has been excellent this year and we've boated many many fish, I think you've just been spending too much time chasing all them ""other"" fish  I hope you hook a biggun before the season closes"
119431,lew,2007-10-01 13:56:00,12767," Doncha just hate when that happens Roy, darned cameras making big fish look like dinks ??"
119434,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-01 14:00:00,698,"That's awesome Lew, well done!"
119439,OhioFisherman,2007-10-01 14:08:00,6623,"LOL, how did you make 10,000 casts that quick? wait 2 fish 20,000? Nice job Lew!"
119483,wuchikubo,2007-10-01 15:21:00,1114,"WTG Lew on the early morning 'skis.   I'm surprised to hear that you went alone.  I'm sure that if you needed a partner in your boat, the spot would be gone in minutes of posting the 'hook up"". I'd be inclined to join you if you wouldn't mind the inexperience muskie angler that I am."
119500,bigbuck,2007-10-01 15:56:00,2449,I think Lew has it down to a couple of hundred casts. Nice Fish!!!!
119559,Kirk,2007-10-01 18:35:00,347,Way to go Lew...great morning and nice fish.  You could probably deliver mail to them the way you just go from 'door to door'
119573,misfish,2007-10-01 18:59:00,29133,"Well know that the pictures are working I got to say,nice fish Lew.  If you crack a smile in one of your pitcures,I,ll do one as well.LOL"
119603,Handlebarz,2007-10-01 19:45:00,3790,nice fish there Lew better then the two I did not get Friday afternoon or night were just waiting for a bunch to start the feeding frenzy
119617,lunkerbasshunter,2007-10-01 20:00:00,2585,great pics!!!  cheers!
119637,Jigger,2007-10-01 21:15:00,1237,Smart fishing Lew. Real nice looking 'skis for sure. Congrats!
119844,solopaddler,2007-10-02 08:53:00,8605,Nice fish Lew!
120900,irishfield,2007-10-05 16:27:00,26272,Great stuff Lew! Nice fish and nice to see you posting pictures. Wayne
120904,lew,2007-10-05 16:30:00,12767,"Hey Wayne, welcome home bud !!  Never mind my pictures, I've been waiting all week to see YOURS !!  Hope you got a monster !!"
120912,irishfield,2007-10-05 17:10:00,26272,"We did well Lew. 30+ fish showing themselves to, or in, the boat over 4 days..25 of them over 40 inches. Lost 6 or 7 between the two of us from bad hook sets while casting and one of them had a head about 8 inches wide. Boated 10 (or 11..gotta go thru the pics) with Dan and I both handling a 50 and Dan a 52 as well. 7 out of 10 fish casting! Bugger Thorpe worked us to death. lol  Not sure when I'll get the post together...got bad news in our family this morning."
119235,lew,2007-09-30 23:33:00,12767,"Hi guys, last Thursday night we had a nearly full moon that wasn't gonna set till about 9:30 Friday morning, so I decided to hit the water early Friday morning and see if the rising sun, combined with a full moon would trigger the musky bite.  The week before, I had encountered a couple muskies in 2 different weedbeds. One hit my bait well after dark one night, but I never got the hooks into her, and I hooked the 2nd one, but she tangled herself up in some heavy pencil reeds and before I could get to her, she pulled my bait free.  I wanted to be on the 1st spot just as the sun was breaking the horizon to see if that would be the trigger, and sure enuff, it worked. I stopped the boat about 150' from the spot and slowly worked up to it while casting a large black spinnerbait ahead of me. On the 5th cast, I landed it right on the edge of some pencil reeds in 3' of water and she grabbed it right on cue, exactly where I'd seen her days before.  I was using my homemade camera stand to take the pics, but I musta moved and rocked the boat cause the picture came out lousy, but you get an idea.    I released her and ran down the lake about 1000' to the next spot where I'd missed the night time fish the week before. Same as the 1st fish, I stopped early and drifted into position and again after only a few casts the water expoded but she missed the hooks. I continued cranking and she hit the bait again but still never got hold of the hooks. I tried a couple more casts, but she was gone for the day.  I moved along the weed edge about another 100' while still casting the spinner bait and hitting every little point and pocket, and after about 10 minutes there was another big boil in the shallow water and I hooked this girl.  Not the biggun I missed twice now in in a week, but still a nice fish.    It's always good when the fish follow the game plan.  It was 7:30 AM and I'd only been fishing for about 30 minutes and I had a couple nice fish in the boat, plus another really nice one that I missed. Not a bad way to start a Friday.  Certainly not monsters, but still lotsa fun.  I continued to fish  till 11:30 but never saw another musky, so I guess the rising sun, plus the effect of the nearly full moon had something to do with it.  Sorry for the poor picture quality, maybe I need a new camera. Here's a couple scenery shots from the same morning that came out not too bad.    "
119238,Rizzo,2007-09-30 23:39:00,4754,"now that's a morning!  Great photos Lew, and nice persistence.  Who needs GPS? Sounds like ypu knew exactly where these fish would be"

119241,Smokey,2007-09-30 23:43:00,1278,Great fish Lew. Heck of a way to start the day.
119242,Mike Pike,2007-09-30 23:51:00,1332,"Ya, well MY morning started in a Tim Horton's line!  A sweet morning, Lew.  Gotta love you musky guys who hold up those giants and say; 'not a biggun.'  That's as good a morning as I could imagine."
