I got a call the next day from the C.O. and within 2 days there was a garbage can on site, more signs up, and all the garbage was cleaned up.  I think I we take a picture, and email it in, along with a call, it will help.  Entropy"

As far as going around and secretly taking pictures and calling the authorities without confronting the poacher only shows me that you have no balls and kind of reminds me of of the sneaky neighbor that phones the cops for any type of complaint and then denies it.  Wouldn't it irk you, especially if you might be the one in the wrong.  But I agree, something has to be done, especially with our ever growing population."
120205,tjsa,2007-10-03 02:29:00,1578," lol how old are you carp-starter???????????? Never mind, I digress, I remember that program also, lol.  I do not get confrontational with many people, occasionally make mention of possible transgressions on their part, with regards to regulations, but have never gotten into any heated confrontation with anyone about it. And, glad I did not.  Yup, if you can do so, take pictures, and if you can identify their vehicle, take a pic of the license plate, and forward the info to the MNR tips line. Some amazing things can come out of those simple things, without confronting the individuals directly.  I spotted some stuff posted on Youtube a few months back, and went.........hmmmmmmmmmmmm. Reported it to the MNR, and they are presently still investigating it, it takes a bit. The person may not be charged, but they will certainly be aware from now on of their transgression of the law, and the fact that they actually videotaped themselves doing it.  Probably just means they won't bring the video camera along the next time, or post it on Youtube if they do, lol."

It was being shown on Sun TV, CKXT here within the Cogeco area (Burlington, Oakville etc). Sun TV is showing other old TV shows in the afternoon during the week.  How old are you since you must remember the time it was show originally?  Have a nice Thursday -  carp-starter"
