I've noticed reports are few and far between lately for them....anyone else having luck?  I've been out a few times this week....had a few on the other night but lost them.  Tonight I broke by 3 outing skunk with this 37"" 19 pound female chinook.  At first she didn't fight too much...and I wondered what I had hooked.  Once she came close to the surface though she took off on some healthy runs and took me about 10 minutes to bring in from then.  Took a little while to revive, but she finally swam away after about 10 minutes.  "

120824,dsn,2007-10-05 12:19:00,1018,I have yet to even land one. Nice going!!  
120841,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-05 13:29:00,698,Nice catch! I think the salmon is slowing down that's why the few reports. Just waiting for the Browns to come into the bluffs to start spoon chucking again.
120860,Rich,2007-10-05 14:24:00,3927,Nice work!

120894,JFish,2007-10-05 15:55:00,29,"I have been to the mouth of Bronte about 8-10 times so far and have only had 2 on.  One morning I saw 4 caught.  I haven't seen many landed since then, maybe 2 or 3.  They are jumping at the mouth like crazy but nobody is hooking up with them it seems.  JFish"
120955,mikeymikey,2007-10-05 18:20:00,376,"Awesome catch.  Yeah, it is very slow now.  Also, everyone notice how low water level has got now ?  I guess now would be a great time to check the structures on the river(s).  I guess more salmon concentrated at the mouth ?"
120957,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-05 18:23:00,698,  At Bowmanville the creek has a huge island right in the middle near the mouth because of low water levels.
121038,ecxstriper,2007-10-05 21:44:00,343,Nice fish Cliff. The water here is really low but the carp and Bass guys are loving it.
