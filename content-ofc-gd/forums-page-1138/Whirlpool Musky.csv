120405,tbayboy,2007-10-03 20:12:00,1497,Nice surprise fish for sure.  Great pics too.
120406,fatherof3,2007-10-03 20:14:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats"
120417,mistaredone,2007-10-03 20:55:00,913,Nice fish Charlie.  Just a little bigger than the one I hit when we were out with Joshua lol.
120427,Rich Clemens,2007-10-03 21:22:00,3131,Ain't nothing wrong with that.   Congrats.
120436,Pigeontroller,2007-10-03 22:14:00,2793,Nice fish Charlie! Now you're a Muskie fisherman!
120445,Rizzo,2007-10-03 22:58:00,4754,I swear the musky fishing in the lower river is as good (or better) than the upper the past few years.  All those fish from years ago must've gone over the falls
120446,charlied,2007-10-03 22:59:00,584,"LOL...thanks guys....ya it was just a little bigger than the one in Joshua's boat.  I took a guess that it was 10 pounds but my other buddy says its over, cause i am 5'7"" and nearly 200 pounds and I am not holding it was out like alot of fisherman do to make the fish look bigger...LOL.  Pigeontroller....LOL....musky fisherman, thats actually only the 3rd musky I have ever hooked and second ever landed.....the only oe I missed was when I was actually fishing for them...the other 2 were when bass fishing ans salmon fishing...go figure.  Fish was kinda like bringing a log in....not much fight to it, it kinda just tried to hold its ground.  Is this normal?  Thanks again guys for saying nice catch.....means alot.  See ya!!"
120447,charlied,2007-10-03 23:04:00,584," There are definately some monsters in there, I have seen many.  Also some DOH HEAD last year caught a 52 pounder in the winter and dragged it in by his boat to Queenston launch, weighed it and then asked us if it was out of season......he released it to the fish gods cause it had drowned of course....some people!"
120465,mistaredone,2007-10-04 00:12:00,913,Can any of you muskie guys convert roughly what a 52 pounder would be in inches?
120470,bassfighter,2007-10-04 00:24:00,366,"Wow! Great musky adventure. What a catch!  The other image looked like you are releasing a giant morey eel.  Do you have a leader on when you caught it?  I am ready to trade catches, I want  one of your musky in exchange for 5 of my salmon. I have to menatally move up to another notch after seeing you got that musky. I have not landed a musky at the whirlpool, they de-spooled me few times, and broke one of my rod ones. I have to start focusing on catching them to get even."
120538,Pigeontroller,2007-10-04 02:38:00,2793,"  There are a few length/girth combinations that could make a 52 lb. Muskie. 55""x28"" would do it, gotta be a real fat girl to get to that weight!"
120611,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-04 13:17:00,0,Nice Musky. I'm Surprised a slim musky like that didn't move with the current and just stood its ground! Water must be really cold at the whirlpool.
120614,wuchikubo,2007-10-04 13:24:00,1114,"wtg on the muskie, nice one.  okay muskie on salmon lure, a steelhead on a muskie lure, have all the fish changed the lure preferences lately?  I'm waiting for the report of a walleye caught with corn."
120649,huey graphite,2007-10-04 16:30:00,362,Wow! Nice catch. Must have been surprised at first sight.  A friend of mine got a sturgeon in the lower rapids several years ago. Said it was 5 feet if I recall correctly. Got it on a mepps spinner while trout fishing.
120659,charlied,2007-10-04 17:36:00,584," I didn't have a leader, just had 12 pound test on, had to use my 12.5 foot rod cause I busted my salmon rod last year, and had an  old real that my dad gave me, said it was my grandpa's....so it was nice to catch it on my grandpa's reel.  If you start focusing on catching them you probably won't....LOL.  I see tons of them down there when the salmon are in but this is the first one I caught"
120839,Squid,2007-10-05 13:25:00,1656,Water is still warm in the river JB. I saw a picture of that musky and it was over 55 inches.
120850,Rich,2007-10-05 13:56:00,3927,"Awesome fish, nice work!"
120921,Fishmaster,2007-10-05 17:29:00,920,Water Temp are way to warm for this time of year water is still 68 - 69 deg
