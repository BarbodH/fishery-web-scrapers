There is a possibility that I will fish LSC also. I am leaning towards going to the Cornwall area and fishing Lake St.Francis with my brother for muskies and also the ottawa river area too."
120587,ccmtcanada,2007-10-04 12:14:00,7971,Not sure yet Shawn.  We'll probably pound the shores locally.  We're having the family over for Thanksgiving dinner on Sunday so we'll be prepping Saturday and Sunday.  Have a great weekend Shawn!

120654,ecmilley,2007-10-04 17:07:00,2163,"well i not sure but i guess fishing for toothy critters on Sturgeon lake won't be a stretch, then maybe I'll try out my turkey deep fryer and if i goof on that i have lots of hamburgers"
