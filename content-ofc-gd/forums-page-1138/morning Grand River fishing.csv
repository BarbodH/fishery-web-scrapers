120345,fatherof3,2007-10-03 17:16:00,1769,After not fishing for almost a week I had some free time this morning so I decided to head down to the river.In 2 hours I managed to catch 7 bass all around this size.   I was trying for carp and finally hooked into this guy.I tried using the timer on the camera as I was alone but I guess he was camera shy.While I am holding him for the first pic he started flopping and was hard to hold as you can tell by my face.   I was just getting ready to leave when this little guy hit.  Not bad for a couple of hours I guess.Was good to get out and catch something again.
