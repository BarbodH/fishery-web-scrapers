Park there and head to the right, you will see a trail going down, careful cause they are doing construction on the trail.  Good luck, might head down on Saturday, not sure.  Look at my musky post to see what I look like and say HI!!  There are a few parking lots but it is the one closest to victoria avenue, just before the bend."
