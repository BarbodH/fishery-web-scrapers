I have heard no less than 5 stories about problems in Coboconk in the past two seasons. The problems have all stemmed from the Red Neck Rowdies that live in Coboconk and have all occurred in town. My Nephew who is 21 and a really soft spoken kid was in the Pattie House in Coby with a few friends and a few of the town Red Neck Bullies decided to take some shots, not a smart idea considering two of my nephew's friends are heavily into Kick Boxing and one of them is a Junior Golden Gloves boxer. Needless to say, a little arse kickin went down. It seems that they have got the group marked for trouble now every time they go for a beer or even show up in town in the boats to get gas etc. I would like to think that this incident is not racially motivated but more just a bunch of Hicks that have nothing better to do. Growing up frequenting Coboconk my whole life, I can honestly say that for the first 20 yrs I did not see an OPP officer between Fenelon Falls and Coboconk more than a few times but in the past 15 yrs or so, I have noticed their presence more and more. I was told that some years ago, a well known Bike Group bought a fair chunk of land in the Coboconk area and at that time things started to go down the hill in the area. I have been told that they have since sold but the Police presence is still there. Let's hope that this is an isolated incident with just a few individuals involved from the area and that things get back to the way they used to be up there. The world seems to be going to Hell in a Hen Basket so to speak and it is pretty scary.  SS"

120328,ch312,2007-10-03 16:28:00,1590,"you do realize that you can defend yourself enough to stop the attack without getting charged with assault and with witnesses to back you up about how they were acting you could have threw in a few extra thumps  its quite sad really. immigrants come to this country and have no clue that there are even regulations. due to the language barrier its very unlikely they will learn about the regs until they have been here for some time. canadians get sick of it and take matters into their own hands because there are definitely not enough CO's to keep an eye on all water bodies.  its something that will never end and with so many people having the ""who gives a rats ass"" attitude the violence will continue. maybe if morontario actually had some stiff penalties stuff like this wouldnt happen.  knock someone out and you get charged and in most cases only have to do community service which would be fine except you get up to a year to complete the required hours. i guess the norm is 40-80 hours of community service. this is one of the main reasons why people dont really care if they get charged with assault.  the way i see it is an eye for an eye. you hit me and you better be ready to catch a right hook in the chops. the attitude so many people have makes me sick."
120332,Terry,2007-10-03 16:43:00,14456,"not completely true, if I am not mistaken the fishing regs. do infact come out in chinese each year regs in chinese here  it seems in every community there is an immigrant support group, that are more then willing to help in your own language. I know when I go to another country, province whatever I do research to make sure I do things within the law...whether it's Cuba Mexico Quebec or Florida I know the rules going in, and I don't think they would say ""oh well you did not speak the language or know the rules or your culture is different so go ahead and break our laws"
