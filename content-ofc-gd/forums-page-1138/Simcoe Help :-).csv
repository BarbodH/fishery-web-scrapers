Been to Port Maitland 2 weeks ago did fairly well but the action was slow,  going to BOQ later in the month and don't want to go just for the day out there.  Guess simcoe is the place to try.  Here is my delema, I know cooks bay and the narrows faily well after than its just chart information.  If the weather stays true its a south wind.  Lakers and Whites are closed. so its perch, bass, pike  Is Jacksons or Virginia a good place this time of year or are the perch moved into Cooks.  The curse of living in Ontario too many fishing ops so little day passes."

Still warm so its later this year....we caught 2 lb smallies at shoals but didn't find football sized giants I see posted.  Curious how many people will be swimming at the PP this weekend."
