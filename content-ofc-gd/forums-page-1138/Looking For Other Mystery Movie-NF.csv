120494,nelly,2007-10-04 01:21:00,256,Does anyone have other recommendation beside Murder By Death or Clue? Looking for the oldie but goodie. They were so funny and not like the new one today. Someone also mention Gosford Park. Any comments on this one?  Murder By Death-10:35 mins.-1976 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4btjVPF76i0  Clue-2:21 mins.-1985
