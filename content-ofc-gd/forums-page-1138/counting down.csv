120589,cthewrld,2007-10-04 12:21:00,99,I'm interested in learning the different ways that people use to count a lure down to a particular depth.  Any and all feedback is welcome.

I have a smartcast castable fishfinder which marks depth.  I'll then cast to that spot....leave the bail open (that way it'll fall straight down instead of coming back towards you on an angle), and count how long it takes before line stops coming off the bail.  I now know how long it takes the lure to hit the bottom and the depth.  If the depth is say 20 feet and it takes 10 seconds for the lure to hit bottom, then if I want to run the lure at 10 feet, I'd count 5 seconds before closing the bail and retrieving.  Hope this helps"
