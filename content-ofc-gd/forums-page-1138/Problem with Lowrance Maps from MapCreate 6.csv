120568,Rich Clemens,2007-10-04 10:14:00,3131,"On my recent trip to the French, I did some playing around with my new LCX 28C in creating Waypoints and Trails.  Ok - Here's what I can't get figured out.  1).  Some of the Waypoints I created in the LCX 28C - I wanted to change to ICONS.  2).  When I came home, I copy the .usr file from the MMC card onto my hard-drive into the User Data folder used by MapCreate.  3).  I renamed the file so that it is specific to the area I was fishing.  ( I have other GPS data files as well).  4).  Checked the coordinates of each waypoint, wrote them down, then deleted those waypoints.  I then manually entered each ICON with the proper coordinates.  5).  I saved this file to the MMC and to my hard-drive.  6).  When I load the .usr file in MAPCREATE, the ICONS are showing.  I can load the data file from both my PC and from the MMC card and all my ICONS are showing in the proper location and the symbols that I had selected to use.  This tells me that I have the files in sync with what I expect to be on there.  7).  But, when I load the MMC into my Lowrance H2O or the LCX 28C ... it still shows my WAYPOINTS (Not the ICONS).  I did rename the .usr data file and I am selecting that one on both of these units to ""LOAD"" the data.  Any ideas why the file shows my ICONS in MAPCREATE, but is still showing them as WAYPOINTS on my two GPS units ?  Although I am selecting the proper data file, what displays on both units appears to be the original file - and not my updates."

120696,Rich Clemens,2007-10-04 20:37:00,3131,"Not on the LCX-25.  I changed them within MapCreate.   I didn't see in the manual where, on the LCX-25 that you can change an existing Waypoint .. to an ICON.   I guess I could have deleted the Waypoints and manually entered the coordinates for the ICON.  Thought it may be easier doing this on my PC"
120758,Tom McCutcheon,2007-10-05 01:39:00,627,Sorry Rich I can't help you; it's all Greek to me. I just wait for someone to take pity on me in my fog and do it for me!!!! Tom
120765,Rich Clemens,2007-10-05 02:29:00,3131,"This may end up being a problem with software versions.    Saving to the MMC from the LCX 28C, the default is version 3.  When I loaded that into MapCreate ... it did not work.  So I went back to the boat and saved my user data as version 2 and was able to successfully load the user data in MapCreate.  I have an E-mail into LEI (MapCreate) to see if they have any ideas."
