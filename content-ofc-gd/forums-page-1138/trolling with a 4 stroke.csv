119821,stuntman,2007-10-02 03:54:00,96,"Hey there,  I am pretty sure just about every boat and motor combination has been run by OFNers:  In the market for a small 4-stroke motor and want to be able to troll with it too. How big is too big for this double duty?  The boat is a semi V, about 300lbs. is 25hp too big?  I love good advice, thanks,  stuntman"
119867,Fisherman,2007-10-02 10:23:00,7201,"a 25 is no problem, I have a 25Honda on a 16' aluminum, I've even seen up to 50's troll slow enough."
119872,taper,2007-10-02 11:03:00,611,The extra power may come in handy some day and you can always throw out a drift sock.
120125,stuntman,2007-10-02 21:14:00,96,Thanks guys
120146,Mike the Pike,2007-10-02 23:38:00,3421, Not the case with my 50hp Honda this model has a carburator and my boat is to light to slow down.Some of the newer motors with fuel injection troll slower.A friend of mine got a new 60hp Mercury 4 stroke last year trolls nice and slow.I think the weight of a boat will make a difference.  MTP
120161,Dondorfish,2007-10-03 00:17:00,1000,My 50 HP Merc 4 stroke will troll down to just under 2 mph ( gps ) on my 16'3  Tracker but we still used the pail down in Quinte last fall to get us down below 1.5 mph.   Don
120177,fishindevil,2007-10-03 00:52:00,6254,"I have  40hp 4 stroke on my 626lb lund,  and i had to put a trolling plate on the motor,well man that works great and doesnt affect any performance or things like that,how ever it does affect the steering a little bit but its manageable for sure...oh ya mine is a tiller ....its always better to get a little more HP...as long as you dont go over what the boat is rated for,by the time you get all your gear and a buddy or 2 plus a windy day....you will be glad to have the little bit extra....they make several types of trolling plates as well for 50 and up and 40 and lower....cheers"
120179,solopaddler,2007-10-03 00:59:00,8605," Yep, me too. I installed a trolling plate on mine as well, works great."
120197,Sinker,2007-10-03 01:58:00,8692,"My 40 will troll down to about 2.2 MPH, but with a bucket in tow, I get 1.5. If I need to go slower than that I use my electric. I should really get a trolling plate as well.......but, It would be no good for the spots I duck hunt.  A 25 should be no prob though....  SInker"
120212,boatman,2007-10-03 02:48:00,350,No problem at all.
120226,Slug,2007-10-03 03:43:00,5,I had a 16ft starcraft aluminum bowrider with a 60 HP Honda fourstroke. Had no problem with it trolling. It got right down to 1.8 mph.
120250,Mike the Pike,2007-10-03 11:12:00,3421, Honda made a 60hp at one time .Dang my boat is rated for the 60 but I have a 50hp Honda no 60 available now.MTP
120646,Bing,2007-10-04 16:07:00,33,"I have a starcaft futura 18' with a 115 hp optima, it fouls plugs up if I try trolling with it. So I bought a 9.9 Mercury 4 Stroke runs great and can go very slow or troll with the downriggers. The Boat and Motor's weight is over 2000 lbs."
120653,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-04 16:44:00,0,I troll with a 225 4 stroke  Yamaha.  I have a 9.9  4 stroke Yamaha as well for SLOW trolling pickerel but when the winds come up I use the big  motor to troll for them. I use the big motor for Musky and Salmon as well. Great engines.  hope this helps!!!
