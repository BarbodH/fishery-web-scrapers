120307,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-03 14:57:00,698,"Hey all, Looking at buying my first Baitcast reel and rod. Tried out my friends a couple weeks ago and love the control it gives you (I didn't even birdsnest that much). I'm looking at a Shimano Curado 201, 300 or a Chronarch 50mg. Anyone prefer one over the other? Is the Chronarch worth the extra price over the Curado?"
120315,Roy,2007-10-03 15:29:00,13728,"Both very good reels but I'd go Curado just for the price difference. I guess you know that the 201 is left handed  and the 300 and 50 are right handed? Model numbers ending in a ""1"" are lefties. Good luck with whichever you choose."
120317,BITEME,2007-10-03 15:38:00,1969,Go Quantum young man bullet proof and beatable
120322,Golfisher,2007-10-03 16:02:00,586,"I'll second Roy's recommendation.  Go with Curado; you won't regret it.  You'll also have to decide on the size of the reel and its gear ratio.  Curado 100 is smaller, with 6.2 gear ratio.  The 200 series are bigger, with 7.0 gear ratio for DHSV and 5.0 for DPV.  I have all three; for what it's worth, I like the 100 series for its lighter weight, smaller profile, and mid-range gear ratio. The 200 series gives you more line capacity, and with DHSV, you can burn spinnerbaits and spend less time cranking back your lure, so it's another good choice.  I wouldn't opt for DPV as an all-around reel though, as it takes forever to crank back the lure; good for pitching worms and working them slowly though."
120323,discophish,2007-10-03 16:04:00,392,I have the new Curado's.  Best I have had so far.
120326,Terry,2007-10-03 16:12:00,14456,"I like the Calais DC, myself but that's just me"
120334,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-03 16:45:00,698,Thanks for the Advice guys. I've decided to go with the Curado 100DC since I think it's best as an all around reel. Don't reel have the money yet to grab different reels for different situations.  Terry-> Maybe when I win the lottery ro find a crazy deal on ebay like someone I know
120336,danbo,2007-10-03 16:47:00,2646,Daiwa Advantage 153 Super-Tuned is my fave bass reel ever!
120352,Zib,2007-10-03 17:32:00,369, Not the Quantum Energy that I have sitting on the shelf in the basement.
120357,lazybum,2007-10-03 17:48:00,142, The baitcaster on special today at LB for $125.00.  Was there this afternoon and got the Daiwa Advantage spinning reel for $135.00.
120358,2kj,2007-10-03 17:48:00,77,"My friend has a Curado, trouble free for many years, great reel.  I have fished with a low profile Quantumn tour edition for just as many years, trouble free and I love it!  The difference is I spent about $100 less, with the saving I bought a nice Shimano rod to a accompany the reel.  For spinning reels, nothing but Shimano but Baitcasters, I would look at a few different makes including Daiwa, Abu Garcia and Quantumn.   Make sure it has a 6 to 1 gear ratio, at least."
120361,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-03 17:53:00,698,I can find a new Curado 100 for 165$ which I think is an awesome deal.
120432,jeffw,2007-10-03 22:09:00,267,I have a Quantum Iron reel that I use for musky and to be honest with you I prefer it over the curados and the pete maina special. Just my two cents. Cheers Jeff
120435,Burning Babies,2007-10-03 22:13:00,150,"IMO the best deal in baitcasting is the Bass Pro Shops extreme combo.  $100 right now for a great rod and good reel.  I liked the higher end Quantum Irons too, but most of them have been out of production for a long time."
120457,PatrickGG,2007-10-03 23:46:00,562,I got the Curado 101d and the Quantum Burner 7:0:1 i had a hard time picking so i grabbed both.
120500,Fang,2007-10-04 01:35:00,1330,"I've fished Curados just because my buddy bought them. I now own 5 BPS Extremes and for 1/2 the price of the Curado I do not find that much difference.  The Curado has a more solid feel in the hand but I pitch, flip and cast just as well with the BPS even with the lighter jigs and tubes"
120565,FishHeadRic,2007-10-04 08:44:00,226,Here's a brand new one 70$ usd plus shipping. Take advantage of the Canadian dollar my friend!!! http://stripersonline.com/surftalk/showthread.php?t=548939  FHR
120575,Blake,2007-10-04 11:35:00,418,The Curado is a great choice.  I have 2 of the high speed reels and they have been awesome.
120733,Hookset,2007-10-05 00:00:00,367,"  Hey cool, I have one just like that. Do you have it in a matching spinning reel like I do ?  Never again.  The Curado is a sweet reel but I gotta admit I have more BPS reels now than anything, and I haven't killed one yet.   Hookset."
120735,Burning Babies,2007-10-05 00:07:00,150,I'm surprised you guys have had problems with Quantum Energy.  Mine have been very reliable (both spinning and baitcasting) - except that the casting real likes to fall off my BPS rod  .
