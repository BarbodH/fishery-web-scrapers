Included in the box 4 free baits,  including a new colour of Cisco and a HUGE Cisco King that isn't even listed on their website. This was on top of the great pricing as their site is in US dollars. Also emails to say my order was shipped by Walter himself and correspondence between us tonight as well at 7PM.  Top Notch all the way !"
