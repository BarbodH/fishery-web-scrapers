I see a bunch of minnows being busted over in a backwater that I have pulled skis out of before. I'm fishing a 8 "" rouser glide bait with a 12 inch leader on 80 lb power pro. Two pulls into my retrieve slam-FISH ON!!! Hold it not quite the fight I'm expecting. The fish is making quick hard turns but doesnt have the power of a muskie. After a battle of about 45 seconds I boat this    Always makes me laugh when I remember all the times I'd finesse down to 2 pound tippet and single eggs."
120547,fishindevil,2007-10-04 02:58:00,6254,Well we would have to know where the river is for that to happen....and here on this board we dont presure anyone for their secret fishing spot....so it would be up to you to tell us that as sometimes that happens on this board as well...so  on the other hand yes its a nice rainbow for sure....you must have been really shocked to say the least..LOL..LOL..LOL  nice catch for sure !!!!!!!  cheers

120603,tonyb,2007-10-04 13:05:00,1637,"Aaron is probably going to kill me for posting this, but it fits well with this thread  Musky lures apparently work well for Steelies  "
120612,wuchikubo,2007-10-04 13:17:00,1114,"Okay, now the stores are going to re-categorize all the muskie lures to Muskie/Steelhead lures."
120622,tipupesox,2007-10-04 14:00:00,167,"I know my friends have reported steelhead catches while fishing Buffalo Harbor in late October/November while trolling for muskies.  Walleyes like to hit the baits as well, I was out with my friend in the evening on Opening day in Buffalo Harbor and he hit a 3 lbs eye trolling 4 mph."
120624,Raf,2007-10-04 14:05:00,3495,they work great for lakers too!  lure is on me knee.
