119955,Uncle Buck,2007-10-02 14:08:00,1000,Picked up a GPSMAP76 @ Bass Pro about 1 month ago...  I'm not impressed with the unit...  It's always losing Signal...  Does anyone else have the same problem? or know of a Solution?
119957,Terry,2007-10-02 14:10:00,14456,only in my house if you are outside you should not lose signal very often
119973,Sherriff,2007-10-02 14:37:00,252,I think your blocking the view of the Satellites UB LOL...  Sherriff
119985,lazybum,2007-10-02 14:54:00,142,Interesting. I was just about to head out to BPS to look at the 76CSX. I'm still going.
119989,tonyb,2007-10-02 14:58:00,1637,"76CSX is a higher-end unit and I have heard great things about it, including being able to receive signal from a basement...  Tony"
119991,lew,2007-10-02 14:59:00,12767,"I have a similar problem with my Lowerance Globalmap 7200  Goran. I don't lose the signal totally, but I often lose it partially, and can only see parts of the map. It disappeares on it's own, or I can zoom in or out and fix it.  I thought it unusual too, but asked the same question here a couple months back and was told by several members that it's a normal thing...... Basically just the processor trying to catch up to the unit.  Funny thing though, I get the worst reception on Stoney Lake.......could it be something to do with all the granite ??"
120006,Deano,2007-10-02 15:27:00,767,"GPSMap 76 is an older unit, the newer units 76CSX have newer chips (SiRFstar IIIâ„¢) that works very well."
120009,douG,2007-10-02 15:36:00,2693,Here is a GPS discussion forum on exactly this topic. 
120021,Uncle Buck,2007-10-02 16:18:00,1000,"i have had mine next to the blue garmin and mine lost signal, while his maintained it???"
120038,Terry,2007-10-02 17:14:00,14456,under what conditions does it lose signal.....I still have my old GPSMAP76 and don't have any problems like that  maybe there is something wrong with it
120064,troutologist,2007-10-02 18:27:00,951,i found there were certain spots that i lost signal consistently with that unit.  but move a few feet and its back in business.  never more than a minor inconvenience in my experience.  ive been happy with it especially considering i got it at CT for half off last year. not the best unit but good for the $$.
120070,misfish,2007-10-02 18:44:00,29133,  Now thats funny.
120074,mikeymikey,2007-10-02 19:04:00,376,Sorry to leech off this topic but...  Anyone know a store in US that have 60CSx in stock?  Somewhere not too far from the border.  I have been checking the price and they are atleast $100 cheaper there than here.   But mostly online stores.
120101,douG,2007-10-02 20:01:00,2693,"BestBuy in Buffalo NY wants 499 US for a 76CSX, while GPS Central in Calgary (online ordering) is 419 CAD, no PST.  Why shop south?  The 60 CSX is the same price at GPS Central - $419, but there is a $50 rebate from Garmin.  You can't beat that deal with a stick."
120144,mikeymikey,2007-10-02 23:36:00,376,Well...  WalMart is Buffalo NY have 60CSx for $350 or so... even Dell.COM  But Must make a order online and have it to be picked up at Walmart.  btw... GPSCity dropped some price.  60Csx is $399 now   www.pricegrabber.com
120148,spooner_jr,2007-10-02 23:40:00,193,"GPS City has the76CSX for $399 CAD, and no PST.  http://www.gpscity.ca/item-garmin-gpsmap-76csx-gps/76csx.htm"
120152,Big Cliff,2007-10-03 00:05:00,6899,"I have a 76 map and never have any problems with it, I can even leave it sitting in the passanger seat in my car and it won't loose signal. It is important to keep the unit almost horizantal to get the best reception."
120271,Uncle Buck,2007-10-03 12:57:00,1000, Under any conditions...  in a car... in a boat...  i'm really dissappointed in the unit...
120281,Terry,2007-10-03 13:37:00,14456,I have never had that problem you may want to get it back to bass pro for a new one or to garmin for repair I got mine the first year they came out and last year upgraded to the colour  map76cs based on how happy I was with the map76
120482,Big Cliff,2007-10-04 00:58:00,6899,sure wish I could spell! LOL
120690,Uncle Buck,2007-10-04 20:24:00,1000,"Well i called Garmin, and they told me to try and reset the unit, gave me some special procedure to do, so i'm gonna try that, otherwise it's gonna go back if that doesn't fix the problem..."
120692,douG,2007-10-04 20:26:00,2693,"Keep at it, Goran.  Garmin has a great reputation for product and service, I'm sure that you will end up happier than you is now."
120831,Uncle Buck,2007-10-05 12:46:00,1000,Well looks like the reset thing didn't work...  lost signal 12 times on the way to Niagara Falls last night...  It's going back
120835,tonyb,2007-10-05 13:09:00,1637,Time to upgrade to the CSX Goran  Tony
