119895,Joey,2007-10-02 12:00:00,9122,"I also tried to contact the seller for you solopaddler and see if it was legit and there was no response, a bad sign when dealing on ebay.  Too bad there are scammers in this world like that.  Ebay certainly weren't doing their homework as it made it to the last day with only 9 hours left by the time I went to bed last night.  Very close. Joey"
119899,solopaddler,2007-10-02 12:20:00,8605," No kidding eh? I was skeptical right off the bat, but for the reasons you mentioned last night wasn't ""totally"" sure. No doubt ebay missed one there..."
119904,Zib,2007-10-02 12:28:00,369,"The guy did state that he would end the auction early if someone offered $3,500. Though I doubt this guy was legit."
119932,Fishmaster,2007-10-02 13:23:00,920,I was searchin the AutoTrader for boats came across a 31 ft beauty boat for $5000 way to good to be true False Phone # so i emailed the guy and got the same repsonce this is forsure a ebay scam ..i wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole ..
119963,linweir,2007-10-02 14:18:00,202,The item is removed completely on Ebay. It must be sth wrong.
120832,corvette1,2007-10-05 12:48:00,1765,bought my corvette on ebay first time it was a scam second one worked fine deal was so good nobody bid but me picked up in michigan
120833,ranger520vx,2007-10-05 12:58:00,164,"ITS A SCAM.  Basically the are looking to get you out of ebay for the transaction and get funds wired via Western Union or something like that. All they are old adds at cheap prces. Being done with Lowrance GPS units, most high ticket items."
119733,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:21:00,8605,"It's currently listed on ebay:  http://cgi.ebay.com/2000-LUND-MR-PIKE-17-F...1QQcmdZViewItem  I emailed him saying I'd buy it for his asking price of $3500, but had a bunch of questions including wanting to talk to him directly..  Here's his response to me:  ""I would first like to let you know that the boat is in perfect condition and will be come with a clear title.  Price is $3,500.00 including the shipping, my associate will ship it via BoatTransportQuotes. I`m currently in Miami running a reseller business. If you want to buy it, email me your shipping address including the full name and i will initiate the sale through eBay. After that, you will get an online insurance from eBay with the payment instructions. Please also  include your eBay ID in your reply.""  Thank you"
119738,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 01:23:00,7971,Wow!!! Great boat and awesome deal!  Hope it all works out for you!
119743,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:27:00,8605," Yeah great deal, maybe too great. Seems too good to be true...."
119746,pigeonfisher,2007-10-02 01:32:00,696,It is to good to be true  pretend you never heard of it and change your e-mail address...
119747,Greencoachdog,2007-10-02 01:33:00,8163,"Out of Miami Fla., naaah. You may want to pass on that one."
119749,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 01:33:00,7971, Hmmm...Took out my code book....if you look at the highlighted/bolded letters in his response you get....  motorissucky...or motor is sucky.  Hmmm...be careful!!!  Ok...can you tell I'm bored??
119750,Gerritt,2007-10-02 01:34:00,6129,"I would walk away from this ""deal"" as fast as you can!!.... there is something wrong here. perhaps his comma is in the wrong position? Something is not adding up here.  Gerritt."
119751,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:35:00,8605, Boat is actually located in Dickson Tennesse (supposedly).
119752,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:36:00,8605, That's funny!
119753,Greencoachdog,2007-10-02 01:38:00,8163," Yeah, but the broker/joker is in Miami. I would seriously think twice about this."
119755,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 01:39:00,7971,Maybe there is a few hundred kilos of drugs stashed in hidden compartments.  The dont really care about the boat...just a way to get it into the country.
119756,argobro,2007-10-02 01:39:00,5,That there is a scam dude!
119762,argobro,2007-10-02 01:46:00,5,"Don't send any money or ID #""s or i'll have to whack you with this pike. Just kidding, I want to try to  post a pic. Here goes. "
119764,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:51:00,8605,"No worries, my momma didn't raise no dummies  . Find it amazing that such an obvious scam would make it onto ebay though. Usually they're pretty vigilant about that kind of thing."
119765,Rizzo,2007-10-02 01:51:00,4754,ooooh the dreaded pike slap...that'll smarten you up in a hurry (will make you stink too)
119767,Joey,2007-10-02 01:52:00,9122,"Well his feedback seems to be okay.  I would guarantee with Ebay that the insurance is there to cover the deal first in case anything goes wrong.  Otherwise, he only has 3 bad feedback and has been dealing on ebay since 1989.  Joey"
119768,solopaddler,2007-10-02 01:54:00,8605," Damn you woman, stop putting ideas into my head!"
119774,Joey,2007-10-02 01:56:00,9122,"Well you just have to go through his feedback.  One of them was a car recently and that went well by the looks of it.  I'm not in any way saying this is not a scam, I just deal on ebay all the time and 3 bad feedback out of 341 over that many years is not bad at all.  And ebay/paypal does have insurance.  Your call bud.  Joey"
119775,Zib,2007-10-02 01:57:00,369,"Something smells funny about that deal. Either the guy is on crack or there is some major problems with it if he's going to let it go for $3,500.  My buddy bought a 2003 Lund Rebel 16 w/40HP Merc on it for $5,700 & I seen the same boat going for 7,500 to 8,000. Ended up that the guy was hard up for cash & took the first offer he got. Nothing wrong with the boat."
119776,fishindevil,2007-10-02 01:57:00,6254,"Well it looks amazing....BUT...the price seems a little low...that package brand new was over 20 grand...its not that old,and would prob go for more money,has it been sunk,was it a repo,does it leak...man for that price i would be driving right now to see that boat in the water and see for myself,i own a lund as well,and i have been on e-bay for along time ....and it just doesnt add up....sorry thats just me...i hope its not what im thinking...good-luck"
119779,Dutch,2007-10-02 02:11:00,831,"As Joey said, his feedback is decent.  If you go for it, do the transaction through e-bay, not privately.  It looks like it may go for even less than $3,500 as there is no reserve on the boat.  I would suspect there is something major wrong with it for that price, seems others are scared off too.  Could be the deal of the century or a complete dud."
119817,Guest lundboy,2007-10-02 03:32:00,0,"That's basically the boat I have except in green (yuck), and I have a 135 Ficht.  I would say the boat alone is worth at least $8000 used without the motor.  It was $14000 new in 2000.  The motor would have been about $9,000 new but since it's a Ficht, wouldn't be worth more than $2k-3k used today (get more for parts).  No one wants a Ficht, can't get em serviced easily (no dealers), problems with fuel pumps etc., no one will take as trade in.  Other than that, it's a fantastic deal and it is quite possible someone needs the cash real bad, with all the credit problems down there, and housing repos going on, maybe $3500 will allow the guy to keep his home.  Even if the motor is pooched (which seems to be pretty hard to do as long as you used ficht oil), it may only need about $2k for repairs (or $8000) who knows.  BTW... I don't know if it means anything, but the registration number is covered up in the pic.  Makes it hard to trace the owner before hand."
119839,solopaddler,2007-10-02 08:46:00,8605,"Well, after contacting ebay in an attempt to get some confirmation on the legitimacy of this auction, within 2 hours they pulled the listing and contacted me saying do not provide this person with any information. Guess it was what it appeared to be, a scam"
119868,Rich Clemens,2007-10-02 10:24:00,3131,Great to see you were doing your home-work and didn't jump right in on that one.
119886,ricoboxing,2007-10-02 11:45:00,398,is he from nigeria?
