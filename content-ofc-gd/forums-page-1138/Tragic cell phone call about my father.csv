120243,pikehunter,2007-10-03 10:22:00,1659,"Thank you everybody for your heartfelt wishes. We made all the arrangements yesterday for his funeral. It was a long tough day.  I glanced at this thread for a moment yesterday but it was too difficult to continue reading then. This morning it is a little easier to do.  Below is one picture I came across of my father and I in Florida with a fish he had caught (After seeing the enlargement of it I see another fish in his left hand.) on a charter fishing boat we had been out on. Later today we will be looking threw my parents albums for pictures for a tribute at the funeral home.  Thanks again to everyone, your comments mean very much to us.  "
