I'm sure other stores stock a few bits as well by AS carries the most.  Staying in Canada the biggest mail order place I've found is www.rodbuildersupplies.com, based in BC.  There are a lot of places south of the border and most of them will ship to Canada but beware two things: 1) their shipping policy, some will charge up to 20% of the order value up to $200 2) try and find a place that will ship with USPS rather than UPS or FedEx. The latter two will charge you brokerage on top of and duty that you need to pay, USPS packages are delivered by the mail-man and you just pay the duty (if it gets applied)"
