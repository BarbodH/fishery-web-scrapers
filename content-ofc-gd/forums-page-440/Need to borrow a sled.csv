I have borrowed two Snowmachines for my Bro and I. Had a sled with a towbar and cover lined up but the guys is up north himself until Friday and I am leaving Barrie Thurs morning so I can't get it now.  Anybody here not going to use theirs this weekend and willing to lend it out? I work in Aurora and live in Barrie. I would need it for tomorrow evening. I will pick it up and bring it back if it is in the vicinity of those areas and in between. I just need it to bring in my luggage and sleeping bag, etc. Please let me know. Thank you."
