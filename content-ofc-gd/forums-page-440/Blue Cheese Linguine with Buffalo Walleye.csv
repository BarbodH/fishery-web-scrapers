666725,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 17:06:00,336,"I thought I would share one of my favorite fish recipes.  So simple.  My brother and I concocted this at our old restaurant and perfected this on fishing trips.  You can substitute other fish or shrimp or giant prawns for the walleye.  Walleye is best, however.  For the sauce: Melt a dad of butter and add cream or half and half to make a simple cream sauce.  You can make a roux but I don't particularly like the color roux imparts.   Add copious amouts of blue cheese. (8 oz.)  I also added some Gorgonzola for extra creaminess.  Simmer till melted and thick.  Give a couple shots of tobasco.   Have your linguine cooking and ready    Prepare your fried fish to your liking.  I just used a light coat of shore lunch.     Wife likes when I cook my fish outside.  I just use my Weber.   Make your buffalo sauce using melted butter and Franks hot sauce.  Be careful sauce will separate easily if you don't stir constantly.  Now that everything is cooked and prepared, combine blue cheese sauce with the linguine.  Serve Buffalo sauce on side.    My plate,  I like to add addl. tobasco.    The combination of the cool blue cheese and spiciness of the buffalo sauce really make this dish work."
666728,Rod Caster,2012-02-15 17:16:00,5784,My cheeks puckered up just looking at all that hot sauce  Your walleye filets look great by the way!
666731,John,2012-02-15 17:22:00,2956,Both sets of cheeks puckered up here.........still think it would be better with pickerel....just sayin'
666732,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 17:25:00,336," Thanks, I am also interested in your Walleye Alfredo by the way.   I do something like that and use some Cajun seasoning."
666733,Live2fish85,2012-02-15 17:28:00,1633,That looks awedome Pikeslayer. Nothing taste better then a sauce made from a heavy cream. None of that healthy stuff.
666736,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 17:36:00,336," Thanks L2F,  in my defense, I did cut the sauce with some milk.   Whole milk.  Lol.  Congrats on your upcoming child.  The way to a women's heart is truly the walleye."
666742,solopaddler,2012-02-15 17:47:00,8605,I'm a fan but you knew that already.
666743,Live2fish85,2012-02-15 17:50:00,1633,"Thanks you Pikeslayer. Should be here anyday now.  I am looking at this bag of perch fillets in my freezer thinking I should try your  dish with that.  I would have to make the wife her own with just an alfredo sauce but that's easy enough. I think I am going to by some cream and blue cheese.  Hope she doesn't go into labour tonight, no way I am wasting my perch lol."
666746,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 17:59:00,336, Yes Solo.  You have already honored my dish by making it on one of your family trips last summer.  I have tweaked the recipe since then by eliminating the roux and the addition of gorgonzola with the emphasis of sauce on side.
666748,adempsey,2012-02-15 17:59:00,1498,I had to take a Zantac just from reading it!!   Which of course means I must give it a try.
666750,Spiel,2012-02-15 18:03:00,9065,"That looks and sounds terrible, do you deliver."
666751,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-15 18:07:00,0,wow.  i thought i was hungry 5 minutes ago.  i might have to try this one out this weekend!
666752,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 18:13:00,336, Only during soft water season.
666762,backbay,2012-02-15 19:08:00,773,I'm hungry all of a sudden!
666773,fishnsled,2012-02-15 19:49:00,3520,Looks great! Funny how you posted this after I just did Buffalo Pike on the weekend. (no pasta though)
666790,Rod Caster,2012-02-15 20:43:00,5784," I am in your shadow when it come to cooking skills... but since you asked.   Pre-made alfredo sauce (make sure the last ingredient is Dimethylpolysiloxane) A bit of pre-made tomato sauce to make that ""rose"" colour Chunks of Walleye Mix thoroughtly and slather over whatever noodles are in your cupboards that are not yet stale. Serve with garlic bread and asperagus.    I looked up that Dimethyl crap and I wasn't too impressed, considering it's also used as a viscosity treatment in plastics... next time I'll make the sauce myself. I'm actually a ""decent"" cook,  but I tend to make things with a strong bachelor-twist when I'm short on time.  Honestly, I was a little embarassed typing this recipe."
666801,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 21:28:00,336,"Lololol.   All I got to say is you may have to work on this recipe a bit, but you were definitely smart enough to serve walleye on Valentines day.  Try substituting coarse shaved parmesan for the blue cheese and cut the cream in half in the above recipe.  Add a can of sliced mushrooms and there ya go. When I moved to Colorado to partner a restaurant with my brother, I knew absolutely nothing about culinary practices.  I only knew what my mom and dad taught me.  I was forced to learn a lot in a short time.  The one thing I did know was to stick to my roots.  I was the only chef in town who used a fillet knife as a chef's knife."
666805,bucktail,2012-02-15 21:32:00,1857,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!
666807,Rod Caster,2012-02-15 21:37:00,5784, Filet knife as a chef's knife   that's good.  The gf loves blue cheese. I'll print this off and try it next time!
666811,Big Cliff,2012-02-15 21:44:00,6899,"Heck, there goes the diet for this month! Boy that looks good!"
666822,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 22:08:00,336,"Sorry bout dat Big Cliff.  Thanks.  I also want to thank: John, Fish Logic, Dr. Sal, backbay, Fishinsled, and Bucktail for their kind words.  Thank you"
666826,chickenhawk,2012-02-15 22:26:00,612,try dipping the walleye in the sauce before battering it.....let the walleye sit in franks red hot or whatever you prefer then dump it in with flour and cornmeal then fry it....common recipe we used for shore lunches at halleys camps very similar to yours....another is walleye stir fry....dont believe me? try it out!
666834,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-15 22:38:00,336," Nice!!!!!!!!  I've heard of this being done, but personally never tried that method.  With the rest of my walleye stash, I make a mean chowder."
