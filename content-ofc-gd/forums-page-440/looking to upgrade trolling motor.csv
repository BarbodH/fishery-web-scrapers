666530,Pigeontroller,2012-02-15 00:05:00,2793,"I have a 16 foot Lund, boat and motor are about 1500 lbs. I switched from a 55 lb 12v powerdrive to an 80 lb. 24v Terrova last spring, love it! I can almost hold myself stationary in the strong current of the Upper Niagara under the Trainbridge, if you've ever been there you know how fast it moves! And I finally installed an onboard charger, thats a nice feature! If you can stand the expense, you won't regret it!"
