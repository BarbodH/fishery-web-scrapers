665843,NARDA1,2012-02-12 16:46:00,6, I've fished Eagle Lake for the last 23 years and really haven't heard alot about them. I do look forward to seeing their sign on the 502 though because it means I'm getting closer to my destination.
665845,limeyangler,2012-02-12 17:01:00,5204,The fishing is ok around that area....i live about 15 minutes from the landing that serves Century Lodge.  HOWEVER....the guy who owns the place pulled a pretty lousy stunt on me when i was out in my boat one year.......so i vowed to not give them any good press ever.
666112,bigcreekdad,2012-02-13 17:32:00,546,What did he do? I believe in a jerk free environment when I'm on the water.   
666123,troutologist,2012-02-13 18:18:00,951,Not sure if this helps but Andy Meyers Lodge on Eagle Lake is a great facility. First rate.  Also they donate to sponsor alot of events geared at getting youth into angling....always nice to support those who give back to the sport.  Andy Meyers Lodge
