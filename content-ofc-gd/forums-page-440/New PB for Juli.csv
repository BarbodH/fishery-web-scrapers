666035,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 13:08:00,2690,"Finally got back out on the famed waters of the Bay of Quinte, Saturday.  Tough conditions, with the wicked cold front, but, Juli latched on to a beauty 8 1/2 lb walleye, her new PB. The fish was only a hair over 26"", but, was a fatty!      Had a great day in FishinMagicians comfy hut, with a few chasers, and some nice perch caught as well.  Even though things were tough, can't complain, especially when a PB is landed!  Love those waters, and, sometimes I really wish I lived on the east side of Toronto"
666038,Roy,2012-02-13 13:14:00,13728,"Great Job, Juli! It certainly is a beautiful specimen. Glad you both had a good time."
666041,Rod Caster,2012-02-13 13:29:00,5784,Holy cow! Quinte sure is producer of huge walleye
666048,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 13:55:00,2690,"  I'll pass on the message Roy.  She kicked my butt again, this has really been her year on the hardwater.   Yeah, Chad, it is a huge walleye factory.  If you ever get the chance, go for it. That said, you have some pretty darn good fishing on your doorstep  We're really looking forward to heading up that way again next January!!"
666050,Spiel,2012-02-13 14:00:00,9065,"Solid fish Juli, congrats!"
666052,mike rousseau,2012-02-13 14:04:00,4661,A 26 incher going 8.5lbs must have been thick...  Congrats...  I'm hoping to get marissa a bigger walleye this year... It's one of the only species I target where her pb isn't what it should be...
666053,ecmilley,2012-02-13 14:05:00,2163,"the smile say's it all, way to go great fish"
666059,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 14:28:00,2690," Yeah, Mike, incredible girth...hard to see on the photo.  Checked my scale too, and it is within .3 of a lb, one way or the other.  Good luck getting Marissa the big one!!"
666075,Live2fish85,2012-02-13 15:23:00,1633,That thing is a beast Frank. Congrats to Juli.  I wish my Girlfriend liked fishing lol. At least my daughter will.
666080,gino,2012-02-13 15:33:00,400,"WOW!!! What a nice walleye! I had a big one last week, love that area too."
666084,Handlebarz,2012-02-13 15:59:00,3790,Great pb juli congrats with the way our area looks its hard to believe that there is ice in ontario
666086,troutologist,2012-02-13 16:03:00,951,"Congrats to her, thats a beauty fish!!"
666087,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 16:12:00,2690,  I hear you Mike!  Definitely have to put some miles on the truck to get to any ice fishing. Look forward to seeing you at the Fishing For A Cure event in July!
666133,misfish,2012-02-13 19:13:00,29133,Great fish and smile. Grats to Juli.
666136,mercman,2012-02-13 19:56:00,7054,Congrats on that PB !! Sure is a beauty. Quinte is on my short term bucket list.  
666139,NAW,2012-02-13 20:09:00,4022,Congrets Juli!  That's a beast.
666142,Joey,2012-02-13 20:14:00,9122,Congrats Juli  Beautiful fish for sure
666143,esoxansteel,2012-02-13 20:17:00,1307,"Congradulations on that big eye Julie, cant go wrong with fire tiger"
666155,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 21:05:00,2690,"Juli says ""thanks to everyone""!!!  Really need to get her set up on the board.  Maybe as the ""Ice Queen"", lol...she certainly has done well on the hardwater this year."
666189,danbouck,2012-02-13 22:55:00,4380,"Congrats Juli, you sure can catch fish  Frank... not so much"
666205,vinnimon,2012-02-13 23:19:00,2593,"Congrats juli on your pb , and ps what dan said x2 , lol"
666208,spincast,2012-02-13 23:26:00,3279,Way to go Juli. Congrats (again)  I think Frank is the lucky charm - he used all his charm getting Juli and now he has none left for the fish .
666234,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-14 01:00:00,2690,"   I was waiting for the peanut gallery to chime in   Thanks, Rick.  I won't deny, she has the magic touch right now.  We've fished on the ice six times this winter.  Juli has caught the biggest fish 5 of those days!!  I beat her on numbers a few times, but, I get as much joy watching her land big fish, as if I caught them myself."
666376,Homer Is King,2012-02-14 16:49:00,305,Great job!!  Congrats on the PB!
666604,Leecher,2012-02-15 03:36:00,7832,The fishing Queen strikes gold    Big brute  Congrats Juli on your PB
