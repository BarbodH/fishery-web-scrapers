665768,BucktownAngler,2012-02-12 06:05:00,582, i concur
665771,BucktownAngler,2012-02-12 06:11:00,582," i agree with that. but thats because this site isnt private. it should be viewable by members only.  anybody could search Steelhead Report on Google and the very first link is a direct post on OFC  i bet most of the views are non registered lurkers. i know a few personally who love to read, but will not register"
665772,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-12 06:23:00,65," Lots of angling forums require registration in order to view the ""reports"" section.  But this forum doesn't have a clear-cut reports section.  All that aside, this thread is hilarious =D  "
665783,Fish Farmer,2012-02-12 11:44:00,2234,"I think that's Port Maitland, and that fish, I've caught that Sheephead Before  Another secret spot blown, I stop there every time I go fishing. But I swear I've seen that corner in Hamilton, some nice ladies hang out there   And Mike Pike I'll share my spots with you, but most of the times I go home with being told you should have been here yesterday. Boy I hate the guy that said that's why it's called fishing not catching"
665828,Moosebunk,2012-02-12 15:41:00,3970,"Cropping is a great tool instead of blurring.  OR, taking a picture up close when worried about background.  Fully understand why people do it.  Doesn't annoy me because they're not showing where they are, but rather that they're altering what could be a better picture."
665836,MJL,2012-02-12 16:21:00,2427,"Or for the DSLR users, shooting at telephoto range or using a fast lens F/2.8 or faster will produce some very nice, creamy bokeh that will blur out the background for you  Imagine wading crotch deep across a fast flowing river carrying a Leica M9 & 50mm F/0.95 Leica Noctilux in hand"
665848,danbouck,2012-02-12 17:22:00,4380,I would rather see a report with blurred images than no report at all
665861,limeyangler,2012-02-12 18:52:00,5204, me too.
665864,misfish,2012-02-12 18:59:00,29133,"It would seem you lose freinds from background shots,but real freinds, wouldnt give a rats ass IMO."
665914,Dave Bailey,2012-02-12 23:33:00,1641,"I'm of two minds about it. I can understand why some are reluctant to take the chance on a good spot getting swamped, but it's also amusing to see someone swirl out a background which you can plainly see is nothing but trees, no buildings or bridges mixed in. C'mon, has anyone got the time to cruise every shoreline in the province before fall looking for exactly the right trees?"
665928,Billy Bob,2012-02-13 00:01:00,5865,Long ago I found it was OK to show and even tell where I caught the fish in the pictures because I know you Canadians can't catch any fish anyways....LOL...
665933,mike rousseau,2012-02-13 00:23:00,4661, Lew showed me a musky pic and I knew right away where he had caught the fish because of a tree line on an Island...  It's not the general public...  It's the guys that know the area of the pic but maybe not the specific run...  I've found spots from careless pictures before... And givin a chance I'll do it again...
665964,EC1,2012-02-13 01:58:00,930,"If anyone wants to learn how to change backgrounds flawlessly, I'll teach them at the cost of a fishing trip. Anything you post on the Internet has a chance to bite you back... Just a matter of thinking before you post."
665972,woodenboater,2012-02-13 02:08:00,2277," lol. the Leica user/collector/fondler would be cradling a bamboo rod, wearing Filson (hey they do make nice stuff) and lamenting the demise of Skinners (which btw was a great shop when Jimmy was working there...) and most likely never actually wetting the line. ever   and this coming from a Leica guy"
666033,Fish Farmer,2012-02-13 13:05:00,2234,"Billy, I can honestly tell you that we wouldn't have caught these if our buddy's down south hadn't gave us a few tips. The picture below is from Big Gull. I'm sad to say 2 of my buds in the picture are not with us any more, but every year we have a toast to remember their passing. Every time I look at this picture it brings a tear. Rest in peace my brothers. "
666193,Billy Bob,2012-02-13 22:59:00,5865, SORRY to hear this Farm Report....
665544,Mike Pike,2012-02-11 14:35:00,1332,"Sorry if this has been covered before but I could use this annoying little feature in some future posts.  lol  So, is this a program that's purchased or is it a free download somewhere?  Thanks for any help."
665546,BillM,2012-02-11 14:44:00,17367,You can do all your editing on Photobucket after the pic is uploaded..  Edit the photo and go crazy with the swirl tool.
665548,mike rousseau,2012-02-11 14:50:00,4661,good idea when fishing on shore...  there are apps for that if you have an iphone  with my iphone i can take a picture... edit the picture with i retouch app upload to photobucket via photobucket app post to ofc with browser and ofc mobile
665549,Fish Farmer,2012-02-11 14:56:00,2234,"Don't take offense. Why? If you don't want to show or help the people here, just don't post, keep it a secret. I've seen this on a few posts. Doesn't make sense to me. We've all seen fish before. Send your pictures to paint shop on your PC. Once you learn paint shop you'll be surprised what you can do."
665554,BillM,2012-02-11 15:10:00,17367, Cause 50 of his newest friends will be there the next day.  You ever wonder why a steelhead report has 20 replies and 800 views?  Way to many people use this site for nothing more then information gathering.  They don't add to our community and are just using it to benefit themselves.
665563,lew,2012-02-11 16:00:00,12766,"Maybe I'm the only one, but when I start to read a post and see the pictures all messed up to hide stuff I just close the post and move on to other things.  Just my opinion though."
665567,gaspumper,2012-02-11 16:23:00,393,Your not the only one Lew.
665570,Blue Lk,2012-02-11 16:29:00,337, Ditto
665573,Rizzo,2012-02-11 16:44:00,4754,"One way to solve this problem, fish like me...barely ever catch anything!"
665576,d_paluch,2012-02-11 16:54:00,343, that's what I do!
665580,Roy,2012-02-11 17:00:00,13728,"I feel like a criminal when I look at blurred shots. I understand why they're done but it really isn't necessary if the cameraman would just point the dang camera in the right direction. Or maybe could it be a feel good experience for the poster because he knows a ""secret"" spot that you don't know about? Or maybe even a spot that you showed him? I don't know, as much as I enjoy reports....well...you know what I'm going to say."
665581,irishfield,2012-02-11 17:08:00,26272,You can also take a little more time when they're still full size / resolution.. edit the background and then downsize to lower resolution / small size and nobody would even know...leaving the beauty of the fish (and background) to the viewer. It has it's time and place....
665585,smally21,2012-02-11 17:26:00,993,"i thought this was pretty much in the rules? not to give away exact locations? i recognize lots of spots even when they are blurred.  thought it was frowned upon to give up spots thru pics?  i dont think the blurry guys are trying to hide anything, thought they were just following the rules..."
665586,Spiel,2012-02-11 17:29:00,9065,   and the solution....  
665587,Twocoda,2012-02-11 17:33:00,4130,kinda defeats the purpose of blurring anything when Geo-Tags are turned on....just saying
665588,Pigeontroller,2012-02-11 17:37:00,2793,"I don't look or comment on blurred pics. Either don't post them, or think about your background when your taking the picture..."
665591,kickingfrog,2012-02-11 17:48:00,8333," Send the photos to me, I'll take care of everything."
665593,Tdel,2012-02-11 17:52:00,393," Put swirls on the landscape, fish, person's face, water and everything between. It is all the same to me because I will move on too.  I guess you could always PM the pictures to all your friends and that way you won't have to swirl anything. Just like when some asks for information and instead of giving it out they say PM me and I will give you the info. I usually ignore those post's too."
665594,Mike Pike,2012-02-11 17:58:00,1332,"No offense taken, Fish Farmer.  To Lew and all the others who said they don't like pics or posts with blurred backgrounds, neither do I really.  That's why I described it as an ""annoying"" feature.  lol  Nothing worse than a photo of a guy holding a fish with no story, no background, no nothing, just someone holding a fish.  Reason I was gonna look into using it was because I fish a lot of shore spots.  It's probably 90% of my fishing.  I feel like I don't contibute enough to this forum with my experences because I hesitate showing the pics where the locations are obvious.  Stories without pics are kinda boring( to me anyway ), so I simply reply to posts on this forum without actually starting any myself.  So, I thought the blurred background option was something I could use.  Share a tale and still show a photo.  Anyhoo, thanks for the help and all the opinions, guys!  It's appreciated."
665595,dwc67,2012-02-11 17:58:00,140,
665597,pics,2012-02-11 18:01:00,1268,When you take the picture you could compose it in a way as to hide and shoreline features. The photo taker could stand while the person with the fish kneels down on the ice....
665635,Rod Caster,2012-02-11 21:08:00,5784,"I don't really care if someone chooses to blurr the background. But I do get a chuckle out of it when the foreground is a mediocre sized fish.  I definitly won't ""avoid"" the report like some of you chaps are suggesting... I'm just not that passionate about the issue."
665643,Terry,2012-02-11 22:00:00,14456,"funny to read they won't bother to read posts that have blurred pictures to protect their spot on a spot but some of the guys would move mountains to get the name of their favorite lake removed from a fishing post on this forum..not their hot spot, but the name of the lake. ..guess to each their own"
665691,msp,2012-02-12 01:47:00,1336,"I have found a better way. When using this technique nobody will know where I am, or who I am, or what im fishing for.  "
665723,Twocoda,2012-02-12 02:51:00,4130,you went to too much trouble....i didnt have to modify the background at all....but i did put Mikey in front of the street sign names...
