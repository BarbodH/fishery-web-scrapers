Came up empty handed, but did come across two curious does, that spent more than 20 minutes within 15 feet of me!! Most of the time they were a bit too close for my 75 - 300mm telephoto I was using..  Snapped off close to 300 shots. Here are a few to whet the appetite. The remainder of the best can be seen on my website:  http://justinhoffmanoutdoors.com/2012/02/14/a-portrait-of-the-deer-in-the-woods/          Also stumbled upon this snowshoe hare..    Thanks for looking..  Happy Shooting,  Justin"

666373,JustinHoffman,2012-02-14 16:31:00,482,"Thanks, bud. Glad you enjoyed them. Off to shoot some duck images this afternoon. Had an amazing time photographing them yesterday on the Ottawa River. Here are two of my favourite from that shoot:      Cheers,  Justin"

666770,misfish,2012-02-15 19:43:00,29133,Very nice Justin.
666827,JustinHoffman,2012-02-15 22:27:00,482,"@Misfish - thanks, bud!  @MikePike - I do have a few in frames in the house. They also make great gifts for various occasions. I have donated them to a few auctions (Big Jim's cancer event and Relay for Life) to be used in the silent auction. I like this last one best.  Thanks for the interest..  Cheers,  Justin"
