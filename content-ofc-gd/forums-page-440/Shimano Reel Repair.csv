666008,4x4bassin,2012-02-13 05:18:00,1025,"I have a shimano scorpion metanium xt baitcasting reel that I got direct from Japan about 7 years ago ( great reel ) I just discovered that it is in need of repair and i'm not sure where to take it. I would imagine parts for these reels are going to be hard to come by.Has anyone here had any repair issues with these reels or even have one and know of a good repair shop. I thought I would start here before I start taking it apart myself , i'm also going to call shimano direct tommorow and see what they have to say.  Thanks"
666010,ah_long,2012-02-13 05:50:00,354,"what's wrong with it and what exactly do you need?  many parts are interchangeable with the USDM equivalent... Shimano in North America won't support your reel, you'll need to send it back to Japan.  PM me if you want someone to take it apart and do a diagnosis for you"
666042,mike rousseau,2012-02-13 13:37:00,4661,Isn't the scorpion just a purple curado? My brother has a scorpion and as far as we can tell they are the same...  I imagine most reel repair men could fix you up....
666047,BillM,2012-02-13 13:54:00,17367,"I can't imagine the reel not being very similar, if not identical to a model offered over here."
666072,ah_long,2012-02-13 15:12:00,354,the metanium XT should be the same as the Curado B
666152,bdox,2012-02-13 20:34:00,329,Scorpion = Curado Metanium = Chronarch
666210,craigdritchie,2012-02-13 23:28:00,1586,Many of these reels share similar internal components. Most repair places should be able to handle it no problem.
666686,4x4bassin,2012-02-15 14:55:00,1025,"This is not the case , the reel is called a scorpion metaniun xt"
666687,4x4bassin,2012-02-15 15:00:00,1025,"Thanks everyone , I got a hold of someone at Aikmens and they said they could probably fix it but just had to look at it first. The winding thingy on top of the worm gear is not moving and actually the worm gear is not moving either I just have to find the time now to drive it down there !"
