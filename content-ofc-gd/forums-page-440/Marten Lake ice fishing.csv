Got some input from a few members on the forum, but I want to see if someone has been recently there. We're staying at Beaverland Camp and will fish both lakes, Big Marten and Little Marten. Thanks! Gino"
666654,fishin jesus,2012-02-15 12:55:00,53,Been there a bunch of times........stasyed at Beaverland tons. they are great little cabins and the owner is a hard hard hard worker. ask him to move huts around and he will . You dont need to get out into big Marten and there is incredible fishing walking distance from the Cabins. go under the first bridge and there is a point about 50 yards to your right. fish 20 feet off shore and there is a ledge. White fish and Pike. Big Marten has the Lakers. either way....the scenery is amazing as its so quiet and secluded.  Way out to the left is another little river mouth as its flowing from the dam ( say the river with the dam to him ). At the mouth big Pike set up shop in the shallow water weed beds. Wish i was going.........had 1 of the best boys weekends of all time there.  this year has been all out of whack with the weather.........crossing my fingers you will slay them...if not...bring lots of vino and deacks of cards!!
