Moderate Action rods in the upper 1/2 of their length. Slow Action rods flex along their entire length.  Power:  Generally used to describe a rod blank's stiffness or resistance to bending.  Speed:  Within the confines of rod building it is generally used to define the rate of response and/or recovery of a rod.  Modulus With regard to the fibers used to make fishing rods, ""Modulus of Elasticity,"" refers to the relationship between stress and strain. In more simple terms relative to rod building, it usually defines the stiffness to weight ratio of the fibers used to construct the rod blank. Generally speaking, the higher the modulus of the fiber used to make the blank, the lighter the resulting blank can be for any given stiffness.
