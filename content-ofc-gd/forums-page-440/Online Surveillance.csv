666481,Twocoda,2012-02-14 22:20:00,4130,wouldnt it be easier for them to monitor the sites in question with that kind of activity and pull ip addys of those that visit them...pay them a visit...think about it ....where does the line get drawn in the sand....for everyone that watches UFC or movie streams ...to me this sounds like a foot in the door for SOPA....  If the FCC can monitor the content over the television and radio....then im sure something can be done to monitor the internet without invading peoples rights...
666491,bushart,2012-02-14 22:33:00,2628,Yup--just heard Vic Toews quote again---I heard it right
666513,camillj,2012-02-14 23:30:00,1988,Sorry ladies ... I really don't understand your gripe - other than the old big brother is watching me crap ... the bad guys have been monitoring you since the inception of the internet (and before if you had anything valuable to steal)... now the govt wants make it legal for them to do the same... to maybe catch some of the bad guys in the act.  If you really think ANYTHING you do on the internet is private you are living in dreamland ... as I always tell people ... dont write ANYTHING you wouldn't put on a postcard ... because many people can and do read EVERYTHING... and there is little you can do to change that (legal or not).

666738,davis,2012-02-15 17:38:00,128,"I totally get how most people would shrug this off because ""i have nothing to hide"". so long as it's not directly inconveniencing you, then who cares, right?  I'm all for getting rid of the 'bad guys', but the bottom line of this specific government initiative - in its current form - is that it's a direct infringement of our rights, and so long as we shrug these things off because we don't think they directly impact us law-abiding citizens, it paves the way for our civil liberties to be further undermined. Just my opinion, and I'm no expert on this by any means. But if you are interested in the perspective of real experts on this issue, check out this mini documentary...  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/xyHnOCDewuQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
666367,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-14 16:16:00,0,"So the conservatives are tabling a bill that would give police agencies the power to monitor internet usage without a warrant.  Does anyone else think this is a violation of our rights?  I mean, the police can not listen to my phone calls or open my mail without a warrant, why should they be able to do the same with email, facebook, cell tracking etc?  And now Vic Toews has come out saying that if you don't agree with the bill you side with child pornography which is the most asinine  thing I've heard in months...  This is some scary Orwellian stuff if you ask me.  What do you guys think?"
666371,mike rousseau,2012-02-14 16:27:00,4661,its easy to see both sides...  if your not doing anything wrong...you should have nothing to hide...no crime no time...  but  what about privacy? if they want to watch your internet usage to prove your some kind of criminal... they should have some evidence suggesting this... which would have got them the warrant in the first place....  i know i dont want people watching what im doing...
666385,12footspringbok,2012-02-14 17:13:00,459,"Gee doc, would you say this is threatening our rights and liberties?"
666388,Live2fish85,2012-02-14 17:20:00,1633,I think it is garbage. What he said about siding with child pornography is just a moron thing to say. We should have our own rights.
666393,hammercarp,2012-02-14 17:34:00,964,"Bit by bit our freedoms get chipped away. What the powers that be are really afraid of is what happened in the Arab spring. Where the internet played a major role in people organizing and communicating about a  revolt. No , our politicians and cops are not evil people. They just think the way they do because it goes along with wanting to lead and control. We always need to be on guard against the loss of rights and freedoms."

666400,bushart,2012-02-14 17:58:00,2628,Well Doc---I watched Vic Toews give that---if your not on our side--you side with the child pornographers.  For some time I've bitten my lip on the goings on and have said zip--as these convo's usually get heated here....so I'll maintain silence.  Just don't look too close---it's really not pretty

Say good bye to privacy as we know it.Arent there laws in the charter of rights that would need to be ammended to allow this type of surveillance?
