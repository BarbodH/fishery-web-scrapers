666089,blaque,2012-02-13 16:16:00,2419,"Streams were locked up this weekend so i decided to try out a thought ive had kickin around in my brain for a while.  Preloading drennan floats.  Not sure if its logical or not lol. The benefits are that is will be one less thing to rig in frigid temps (applying float shot under the float). Also, when adjusting the float location, (sliding it up and down mainline)i dont have to worry about burning the mainline if the float shot are tight to the line.  Drawbacks may be how this float will now track as the load isnt at the lowest point on the float. Also, depending on water conditions, you may still want to adjust the weight which isnt possible when inserted into the float obviously. But for me, i think this should work for 95% of the water type i fish.  We shall see as i havent thrown these at any fish yet.  Pretty simple........drill a small hole in the float, load shot into hole, fill with aquaseal to just above hole. Aquaseal will lock shot to the bottom and obviously also seal the hole       "
666094,Moosebunk,2012-02-13 16:42:00,3970,"The engineering looks great Blaque but I'm not sure why it's necessary?  My understanding of shot is to more or less get your lure/bait to the preferred depth, and in the process balance the appropriate sized float for the water being fished...  This float may be balanced, may sit perfectly on the water, but what's going to happen when you need more shot to properly present the bait?  Presuming that what you're rigging this for are winter steelies in current conditions...?"
666096,mike rousseau,2012-02-13 16:45:00,4661,I believe the idea is to be able to use a large float but still very sensative to a strike without adding all that shot every time...  As far as I know your float should sit with only the red cap out of the water... So this float will sit nice with a couple shot on the line...  Really nice work...
666103,solopaddler,2012-02-13 16:58:00,8605,"Interesting adaptation, nice work.  I'm not a fan of plastic floats but have been making self cocking balsa floats for over 30 years now.  I use the weighted floats when ultra stealth is needed when fishing short leads in clear slow frog water.  What I've always done is wrap a chunk of leadcore around the bottom stem of the float and cover with a thin coat of epoxy. Works very well.  I'd guess you could do the same thing with a Drennan as well."
666104,Snidley,2012-02-13 17:00:00,620,That's how you rig a float for fishing jigs since the jighead gets the jig down and the rig casts better as well. Some slip floats come rigged with weight to accomplish this very thing.
666105,BillM,2012-02-13 17:01:00,17367, I think the only time something like this is useful is if you're fishing frog water and you need the added weight in order to reach the fish.
666113,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-13 17:32:00,826,I like it. Good idea. R
666115,Spiel,2012-02-13 17:35:00,9065,"I like it, certainly will have times when it'll be an asset."
666125,blaque,2012-02-13 18:22:00,2419,"My thought is that i would preload them to 70ish percent and the rest of my presentation will take care of the rest to get my bait down.  I always end up putting about 4 larger shot just under the float....and if fishing eggs for instance, i will use smaller shot for whatever shot pattern i need  to get the bait down. That would be the other 30% that the float has left to load.  Basically its just a head start to ""true"" the float...... And more importantly its 4 or 5 less lead shot ive got to pinch with my teeth. Im becoming more and more concerned with that as i age lol.  In reality......when fishing jigs (which i fish primarily it seems), I only use float shot right under the float to true the float.......and the jig. So i would just have to throw on the loaded float and jig. No lead in my mouth whatsoever.  Anyway, all the comments are right on. It works for some situations, and some not.  Just the outcome of a sunday night with no football or hockey to watch LOL"
666126,blaque,2012-02-13 18:25:00,2419, You got the idea
666127,blaque,2012-02-13 18:26:00,2419, Ya that makes sense.....and could be one of the drawbacks if you have to adjust with alot of shot and end up drowning the float
666128,blaque,2012-02-13 18:27:00,2419," Bang On.....like i said, i fish jigs a majority of the time and this is where the thought came from"
