666721,Headhunter,2012-02-15 16:51:00,5703,"Here's the funniest part Phil.... Once I got it un-packed, I suggested that we put it in the front window, so everyone could see it... I got that look! (if you are marrried, you know the look!) I then suggested that perhaps the mantle on the fireplace, in the family room, where it can be seen would be better... the ""look"" intensified! I then suggested that it would make a great lamp beside our bed, as it has a nice soft glow to it's light... I didn't know that a face could look like that!  So, as of now, it's sitting on the kitchen table, awaiting the verdict on it's final placement... I just hope that it doesn't meet with an untimely demise! HH"

I was supposed to get dinner to eat in, but I only had the spare change in the car. I had 17 dollars and 63 cents. I bought a pre barbequed chicken, potatoe wedges, a can of green giant corn(peaches and cream), and I have enough spare to buy a no name box of ferreroo rochie's. I appologized when I got home. Explained the situation. We ate dinner, and she went to bed. Now I am on OFC, watching the hockey game with the couch to myself...         Winning!!!!!!"
