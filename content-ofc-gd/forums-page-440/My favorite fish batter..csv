664976,Ron,2012-02-09 18:13:00,1683,"Seems as though many many threads have come and gone with fish cooking recipes. So I thought I would try one that only people put their recipes on.  Here is a few of mine.  Pan fried:  Take boneless fillets and paper towel dry. Beat one egg with equal part Ranch salad dressing. Mix Italian bread crumbs with Parmesan cheese (50/50), place in bag. Add enough oil in pan to half cover fillets and heat to 325.  Dip fillets in egg wash, let excess drip off and immediately roll in breading mix. Fry in oil until golden brown, flipping once only. Serve with your choice of potato or my favourite, lemon rice and peas.  Substitute Italian bread crumbs with you favourite flavour of Potato chips (all dressed is mine). Just be sure to pulverize them very well, almost into powder form.    Deep fried:  Do yourself a favour and go the Bulk Bin store. Get their powdered fish batter, substitute water with beer and you are golden. It is THE BEST I have ever had.  Mix as per instructions and it is very important to let stand a minimum of 5 minutes. This lets the active ingredients work to produce a nice light and fluffy and crispy coating. Before you start cooking up the fillets, try some deep fried mushrooms. This will keep the hungry mouths away while you are cooking in the deep fryer.  Another secrete to crispy batter is to use a proper deep fryer, something that holds lots of oil so that it does not loose it's heat as you place in battered fillets.  Cheers, Ron..."
664988,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-09 18:52:00,336,"Ron, that sound delicious!     Tell me more on your lemon rice, sounds great.   My favorate walleye breading is as follows:  Take a couple cups of flour in a one gal ziplock bag.  Add club soda to the flour and make a wet batter, couple of shots of tobasco and thats it.  Run your fillets through the wet batter and season with lemon pepper or seasoning of your choice.  Roll in Panko and fry.    Give it a try, simple and not over-powering."
665003,Headhunter,2012-02-09 19:41:00,5703,I like the idea of the Italian dressing! I have used instant mashed potatoe mix instead of bread crumbs with great success... thin crunchie coating... HH
665133,Fisherman,2012-02-10 00:46:00,7201,"I found another good stand by is the ranch flavoured chip dip from Frito Lay,  great for fried perch finger food."
665136,Live2fish85,2012-02-10 00:58:00,1633,Rons Beer batter is awesome but my favourite thing for perch is.  Flour the perch after cleaning then Egg wash with little milk then cover in bread crumbs with salt and pepper.  Then deep fry.
665137,Live2fish85,2012-02-10 01:00:00,1633,Pikeslayer that walleye batter sounds awesome.
665146,Acountdeleted,2012-02-10 01:32:00,2562,  For the longest time I used to use pringles BBQ chips for batter.   Last week the girlfriend requested Doritos sweet chili heat and it was dynamite. I don't know if I'll ever go back.
665149,backbay,2012-02-10 01:36:00,773,"I take 2/3 corn meal, 1/3 flour, seasoning salt, black pepper, a little cayenne, a little paprika, and a touch of garlic powder, and a touch of onion powder. Mix it together, cube the fish and coat in milk, then the breading, and off to the deep fryer."
665196,Acountdeleted,2012-02-10 03:37:00,2562,Actually I'm hoping you guys can help me a bit. Its been driving me nuts. When I make my batter I usually coat the fish in the carton egg mix and then toss it in the crushed chip batter. Problem is that the batter sticks better to itself then to the fish. Any advice on how to get it to stick to the fish better?
665199,Live2fish85,2012-02-10 03:42:00,1633, Aftet you clean the fish cover it in some powder and then egg wash then put the breading on it. Thay way you shouldn't have a problem.
665201,NAW,2012-02-10 03:50:00,4022,"Ron, that sounds delish!  I'm gunna try that.  I have a home made recipe that I made up when I brought home some pickerel but had not generic fish crisp.  The process is similar to others.  Dry fillets, egg wash, mix in breading, then fry in a pan.  I've used all sorts of fluid ranging from butter, veggie oil, canola oil, cocoa nut butter, butter.  I still haven't tried lard yet.  The different is in the home made fish crisp.  The qty all depends on how many fillets you have.  Here's the ingredients I use:  Italian bread crumbs.  (or bread crumbs mixed with Italian seasoning) Bisquick (or pancake mix) Chili powder Salt Pepper Spike seasoning Natures Seasoning.  Add what ever else you want!"
665210,paul_614,2012-02-10 05:01:00,168,"Crushed potato chips are the bomb, tons of flavours available for next to nothing"
665291,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-10 15:21:00,336," I about forgot, give the wet batter a shot of baking powder.  Thanks, man"
665308,Live2fish85,2012-02-10 16:33:00,1633, I would have to say crisco/lard is by far the best thing for frying anything in. It is also a heart attack waiting to happen. Unless if you only deep fry thing once or twice a year lol. Myself I stay away from it for the most part but when I do it is amazing. Try it sometime
665335,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-10 17:31:00,336," Good point L2F, I've found for ultimate flavor to use 2 parts crisco to 1 part lard.  When that is hot throw a pound of bacon in and cook till done.  I then pull the bacon and use on salads and the like. My arteries are shrinking a bit just thinkin bout it."
665342,backbay,2012-02-10 17:42:00,773,"Has anyone tried peanut oil, or any other ""healthier""  alternative?"
665361,brw,2012-02-10 18:21:00,101," To me the initial question is: what fish are you frying? Walleye (perch too) are so naturally good tasting that the key, I think, is to allow that great flavor to come through. Beer batters and other complex concoctions I leave for the cods of this world. For eyes I have found that, the simpler, the better. An old standby that I used to use I brought back recently and I forgot how good it was. Simply take some instant pancake batter (couple cups), about a TBSP of good hungarian paprika (Sweet or mild depending on your taste), a large pinch of kosher salt, and some fresh ground pepper, and place in a ziplock. Just clean filllets w/ some water, pat off, and shake. No egg wash necessary.  Very tasty and its a combo of slightly sweet, salty and a little heat mixed in. Simple and good."
665369,jimmer,2012-02-10 18:35:00,2730,"For those that like a batter coating, try Brodies XXX Flour (it already has the baking powder and salt in it) It's lighter than most other batters and comes out nice and crispy. Add paprika or other spices if you like."

666199,Billy Bob,2012-02-13 23:07:00,5865,Just slice the fillet extra thin and eat sushi....
666292,Live2fish85,2012-02-14 04:39:00,1633, I grew up with it that way. My grandfather and I used to go out catch a bunch of fish come home we would clean them and grandma would cook them. I have never tried the bacon in ot but I am sure it would add some nice flavour and it can't get any un-healthier I may just try that. I figure I already got a few heart peoblems whats one more lol.  Lifes to short to not enjoy it. I quit smoking and all that crap may as well eat what I want even if it isn't that healthy.
