665112,kuhaman,2012-02-10 00:06:00,503,Just curious to see how many board members use alternitive power sources at their cottage and or home. If so what do you use?
665116,bigugli,2012-02-10 00:10:00,6138,"Until relocating 2 years ago, our home of 20 years relied on wood heat. I could not find an economical hydro alternative for our location that was also legal."
665117,bushart,2012-02-10 00:16:00,2628,If you find one--let me know
665121,kuhaman,2012-02-10 00:20:00,503,"??? I mean other than being on the grid eg solar panels,windmills, gensets."
665126,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-10 00:32:00,10439,  Lots of people living off-grid here. Most of the ones that live off-grid full time use a combination of all three or a combination of solar and generator.
665138,pics,2012-02-10 01:07:00,1268,My cottage had no hydro lines so I installed a solar system. I used collected rain water and a 12 volt on demand pump for water that was heated with propane. A propane fridge and stove and a woodstove for heat made it feel like we had hydro hooked up. Oh yea.....a composting toilet made trips to the outhouse just a memory....
665257,bigbuck,2012-02-10 14:17:00,2449,"A couple of good sized panels with a good battery setup and you should be fine, you won't have enough power to run electrical heating but you will have enough for lighting, basic appliances (toaster or coffee maker), a water pump and battery power for your propane fridge. It can be done, just depends on how much you are willing to pay up front and also factor in maintenence costs as well (battery replacement and the like). I've got a client who did that with his cabin up near Parry Sound, he's off the grid and he lives there year round now. He chops lots of firewood in the spring to feed the woodstove to keep the place toasty warm (actually hot)."
665263,bushart,2012-02-10 14:23:00,2628,Anybody know anything about generating hydroelectricity if you had falling water??
665326,bigugli,2012-02-10 17:20:00,6138,One phrase.  MNR and Crown rights
665355,kuhaman,2012-02-10 18:08:00,503,Do you know what type of inverter and batteries your client is using?
665476,bigbuck,2012-02-11 01:28:00,2449,No. He was an electrical engineer and used contacts from his days while working. I do know he did not skimp out and it wasn't cheap but his system works quite fine for his needs.
665478,pics,2012-02-11 01:43:00,1268,"Trace makes a nice inverter...I would go with a 24 volt system thats good for 3000 watts....If you plan on living off the grid, a small wind generator would give you a boost in the winter when you only get a few peak hours of charging. A digital charge controller would also help."
665485,Gerritt,2012-02-11 01:52:00,6129,Look up Les Stroud off the grid on youtube... you wont regret it.   G
665486,danbouck,2012-02-11 02:05:00,4380, Yep that was a great watch  I have solar at my boathouse now. Mind you I only use it for lights but a beer fridge may be in the future

665596,Oggie,2012-02-11 17:59:00,588,"Don't forget Ont Hydro charges a flat rate of around $500 for a cottage regardless of how much power is used. If they keep raising that flat rate, off the grid systems are going to become cost effective. Dan O."
666066,Steve Piggott,2012-02-13 14:47:00,196,"If you are off the grid, you sill get a bill for delivery to the pole out side your house.Got to feed the government."
666180,Jigger,2012-02-13 22:33:00,1237," And if you don't pay it, then what? They cut off the power to that pole? I find it hard to believe that any court would find against the home owner if ON Hydro were to sue for an outstanding bill in regards to absolutely nothing. But then again, common sense and courts don't always go hand in hand."
666185,Steve Piggott,2012-02-13 22:48:00,196,Look at your electric bill. They deliver you don't have to use it.You will pay the delivery charge. Gas is the same thing
666186,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-13 22:51:00,10439, So if you are not connected to the pole and you cancel your hydro service they charge you just because. If you are not hooked up to the grid and do not get a bill and do not want their service there is no way they can charge you for it.
666187,danbouck,2012-02-13 22:52:00,4380, I believe you actually need to get your wires disconnected and the meter removed otherwise you will pay
666196,Steve Piggott,2012-02-13 23:02:00,196,"A friend of mind is off the grid, but sill gets a bill for delivery.It's a the Goverment run operation.They will get you.LOL"
666197,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-13 23:03:00,10439, That's exactly what I'm saying. If you are not connected to their system they can't charge you for delivery to the pole that you are no longer connected to.
666226,bigbuck,2012-02-14 00:35:00,2449,"Hydro service isn't mandatory. If you use, you pay unless you are stealing electricity for your grow op."
666232,kuhaman,2012-02-14 00:48:00,503,?? First hand experience?
