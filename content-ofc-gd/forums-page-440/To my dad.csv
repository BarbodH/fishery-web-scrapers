666265,irishfield,2012-02-14 02:28:00,26272,"Taken me a while and I haven't come up with anything great to say as it touches way too close to home for me fella... I was 23. I know it's all a blur right now for you, but trust me when I say it will all work out..it just will. Mom is gonna need your helping hand for stuff and she's also gonna need her space. You'll know when and where I'm sure and life will go on for all of you, albeit with a broken heart.  Godspeed to your father... always loved his posts. Seemed like one down to earth, grounded man with a level head on his shoulders. Never had the pleasure to meet him unfortunately. My loss!"
666267,ketchenany,2012-02-14 02:32:00,3229," Irish, you said it all, thanks."
666276,solopaddler,2012-02-14 02:52:00,8605,"Alex you seem like a well grounded young man. I can only hope my young lad grows up the same way.  No one deserves this type of thing, there is no consolation.  One day I suspect when you have kids of your own you'll be a pretty great dad. He'll live on in the eyes of your young ones when you pass on all the knowledge he gave you."
666282,Pigeontroller,2012-02-14 03:20:00,2793,"As hard as it may seem now...You'll get through it. I know how you feel, I lost my Dad in 2003, just before I turned 30. I remember thinking that wasn't long enough to have a Father...Then I reminded myself how lucky I was to have him for 29 years. Your Dad sounds like he was a great Man, he lives on in you."
666415,Jds63,2012-02-14 18:27:00,1365,My sincerest condolences to you and your family.

666744,adempsey,2012-02-15 17:57:00,1498,"I am very sorry for your loss.   There is no doubt your father's proudest day was the day you stepped up in his unfortunate absence.  You can be sure he expected nothing less, as you are his son.  All the best to you and your family in these difficult times."
666757,Peps,2012-02-15 18:55:00,191,"Alex, I am really sorry for your loss. My deepest condolences to you and your mother.  Your dad will live on forever through you.   Peps (Sandro)"

666092,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-02-13 16:36:00,160,"Hey all. I just want to let you guys all know what my dad meant to me. We did absolutely everything together. Everytime he called my cell I knew he had somthing to say about fishing,hockey,the cottage the snowmobiles or atv. I always enjoyed talking to him about all this stuff. He loved my mom and that's who I'm most scared about. My dad would want me to taker care of her the best I can. I am now ""the man of the house"". I started playing hockey at about age 4 and to this day I'm still playing. Last night (feb 12) I had a game at night. I went to the game because I knew my dad wanted me to play. He would do anything to not let me miss a game and I knew he would want me to play. I have played over 500 games and e watched more then 90% of them. If there's one game he wanted me to win,get no penalties play my heart out and last but not least score a goal this was the game I can prove to him. Just imagin looking into the stands and not seeing him how I had to play. Btw I did all the things I listed before. He wa with me. I felt him and I love him.   R.I.P Tony Mazzuca <3 aka motion"

666100,lew,2012-02-13 16:49:00,12766,"Sounds like your Dad was a pretty wonderful guy who must have loved you alot the way he was so involved with everything you liked.  Talk about him often and think about him always, and you'll have those great memories with you forever."
666101,NAW,2012-02-13 16:53:00,4022,"It sounds like you know what you need to do Alex.  It's going to be rough, but you will make it out in good shape, I'm sure of that!  Being the man of the house is nothing to be afraid of.  Just take it one step at a time.  Edit..  If you have any pictures of your old man holding some big fish, you should post them up!  P.S. When I was talking to your dad a few weeks ago, he could stop talking about how great of a son you are.  He was proud of you, and your achievements."
666106,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-13 17:03:00,2690,Condolences to you and your family.
666107,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-13 17:10:00,2582,So sorry for your loss young man. That was a great post you made. It sounds like your dad was a great father and I'm sure we would be very proud of you.
666108,Rod Caster,2012-02-13 17:17:00,5784,"Your level head and good attitude are a reflection of the values your Father has instilled in you. From what you describe, it sounds like he was the best Dad a guy can have. That is something to be very proud of!  I had a great time talking with you and your Dad. I could tell right away that you are both great people in aloving family. My heart goes out to your Mother and you, Alex. If you ever feel like schooling us ""old"" guys on Nipissing again, your know who to contact."
666109,mercman,2012-02-13 17:20:00,7054,"Alex, your dad thought the world of you.When we spoke last, i commented on the video taken at the G2G, and i could hear the pride in his voice as he spoke. I lost my Dad a number of years back.He was alot like yours, avid Angler and a great outdoorsman. I feel him with me also, especially when i fish.he loved fishing with a passion, and we spent many hours on the water together. Be strong for your mom, but allow yourself to grieve, and know that you will never walk alone in this world as long as you keep his memory alive.  Paul"
666110,Harrison,2012-02-13 17:20:00,2202,"When I think about the posts I remember from your Dad, the main thing I recall is how proud he was when he talked about his son and his job in the fishing dept. at Sail.  There was no mistaking how proud he was.  I know it hurts like heck right now, I lost my Dad too recently.  I am a PM away anytime."
666118,Nipfisher,2012-02-13 17:50:00,2449,"Hey Alexander (as your dad called you). You know my son's name is Alex as well and I am the only one that calls him Alexander, usually when he is in trouble.  I remember when your dad called me from his cell as you 2 were heading to the North Bay waterfront for some perch fishing that Friday night. When you left the hotel you were driving and you turned left. I had told your dad to turn right but some how it was your fault eh? It made me laugh. I heard the discussion about you turning around and I could just tell how close you two were. Like buddies as much as father / son.  When I walked out to meet you guys with my little guy Karter you both made an effort to stop fishing and introduce yourselves to me and Karter.  You are VERY much like your dad was. Take pride in that. You are a fine young man and your dad was and still is proud of you. You already have all the necessary tools to be the ""man of the house"".  Take time to greive with your family. It is part of the healing process. When the greiving is done Celebrate his life.  Keep doing all the things you did together and most of all Keep making him proud."
666119,bigbuck,2012-02-13 17:52:00,2449,Put one foot in front of the other and move forward. That's all any of us can do. Take care of yourself and your mom. Your dad sounds like he was a heck of a guy. Hang on tight to those good memories.

I really enjoyed the enthusiasm and pride he showed when he first posted about you getting into SAIL. Prayers and thoughts go out to you and your family."
666134,[emailÂ protected],2012-02-13 19:19:00,119,"terrible tragedy, my condolences to you, and your family. I was speaking with my mother, who works with one of your uncles(?) at Bombardier.  He is heartbroken, and was worried about both you, and your mother. From all accounts, the posters above, as well as your uncle, you sound like a fine young man.  This is obviously a very difficult time for you, but take solace in the fact that your father was/is very proud of you, and he will walk with you, always. Cherish the memories, and never let them fade.  Nick"

You're mom will need you and you will need her more now then ever and don't feel bad about sharing your pain with your friends.  They can and will help you heal, in time.

To refresh your memory I'm half of the Brian & Brian team.  Your dad was so proud of U when U iced the 3 walleyes in less than 30 minutes.  Shows he was an exceptional person. Keep strong for your mom & I'm thinking of you at this time. All my love   Wormdunker"
