666541,Handlebarz,2012-02-15 00:39:00,3790,Well I have read a bunch of threads on the Gopro and see where it lacked with the under water camera action on the first edition I was wondering has anyone used the Hero 2 under water to see what a difference there is?  Is the water proof case better and do you still need to make a after market fish eye lens?  Where would be the best place to buy it for price wise I have looked at the big box FS and BB on line only.  Thanks for the help

Having not used it yet, I can't say what my experiences are... but doing some brief research has led me to a few sites that sell flat lens upgrades. I believe the housing is the same for both the new and old versions, it's the lens that needs to be swapped. The curved lens that is on the housing you get when you buy it causes the blurriness and lack of focus. You need to swap in a flat lens to correct this. I saw some vids and it makes a noticeable difference."
