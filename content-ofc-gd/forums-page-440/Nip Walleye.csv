665940,Rod Caster,2012-02-13 00:53:00,5784,"I woke up at 5am this morning. For no reason.... I just, woke up. The gf was sound asleep, I turned a few times, checked OFC and my thoughts were strong with Tony's family. After 30 minutes of sleeplessness, I gave up trying and quickly packed all my fishing gear and a half-assed sorry excuse for a lunch. 2 tuna cans, a pot of tea, a banana and one smoked herring.    I arrived at my spot at 630 and watched the sun come up as I jigged my silver Worek spoon in 30 fow.      At 730, the fish woke up and began nibbling. A few perch and keeper sized walleye were iced and the action just got better from there. By 830 I had 10 walleye, a herring and several perch.          At 845 I missed a big fish. At 9, my line went limp as something took a good swing at my Worek. I set the hook and knew I have a big fish. Maybe a ling. As the fish approaches my 4""hole, things got dicey.... I though for sure I'd need some lube to get it through but I manage to softly pull it out. HUGE WALLEYE! I didn't measure it but I'm guess 25"" and 6 or 7lbs. My biggest ever on Nipissing. Two quick photos and away she swam.       Once my Dad got wind of the good fishing, he rushed to the lake with some fresh minnows. We ended up icing over 50 perch another herring and another 10 walleye.    Suprisingly, the evening fishing was slow, with only one keeper walleye caught by my buddy who showed up later in the day. The sun set and I dragged my tired butt home. Lots of cleaning ahead for this hombre.  Goodnight Nipissing.    "

666061,Rod Caster,2012-02-13 14:33:00,5784,"Thanks for the great replies guys!  Simon: I agree, overall guys are doing well this year. This is great for the tourist industry here...thin ice down south and good walleye on Nipissing.  My goal for Nipissing every winter is to catch at least a couple 5+ lbs walleye. Even with a slow start (due to ice conditions) I think I might reach my goal again this year!"
