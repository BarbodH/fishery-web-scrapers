Did you hear about the snowmobile accident in Bracebridge? Well I chimed in, is it Tony or Rino? It was Tony, (Motion) apparently my son-and-law are extended family! One of Tony's other cousins has been at my home and have enjoyed a glass of wine together! Met Alex and offered my deepest condolences to his family. It was hard believe me, it was held in the same room where my mother was last year. May he rest in peace, He had a lot of close friends and family.  Albert"

But from the little that I new Tony, I think he would understand what a heavy work load is all about.  That guys cell phone was ringing none stop for a good while at the Nip G2G."
