666622,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-15 06:45:00,65, I still don't understand what Highdrifter said =P.  No leader? =S  Going in with minnows next time.
666656,Rizzo,2012-02-15 13:03:00,4754,if you're going with a minnow you will definitely want a leader! Pike are stupid or they are blind or both. I catch annoying amounts of pike using leaders and from much heavier pressured waters than where you're talking.
666678,Live2fish85,2012-02-15 14:36:00,1633,If your going with a minnow. Get a quick strike rig with a large minnow and use it under a float about a foot off the bottom.
666729,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-15 17:19:00,65," Awesome, I'm assuming a sliding float would be needed to suspend 1' off the bottom.  I could use a swivel with a bell sinker to the same effect right?"
666753,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-15 18:23:00,698,  Minnow and Float is a great Pike tactic but I have found that at Harbourfront  its best to cover a lot of water as the density in the pike population isn't as great as other places. Also one of the reasons the pike are leader shy. Sure you don't have as much pressure but you have much less fish so it balances out.
666767,Live2fish85,2012-02-15 19:20:00,1633,I would use a leader regardless. Try making a flouro leader with some flouro whether you use 50lbs or what I wouldn't take a chance at pike with out a leader.
666969,farsider,2012-02-16 03:40:00,456,"I would also add my vote for you to use a leader.  There are plenty of big and small Pike around there. You shouldn't want to take a chance at losing your lures/hooks/bobbers or worse leaving your lures/hooks in the Pike and possibly crippling or killing them.  Cheers, Mark"
666986,Live2fish85,2012-02-16 04:21:00,1633,If you think they won't cut the line either they will. When I am fishing the inner bay at Long Point I get the odd hammer handle going for bass and they cut my 50lbs braid like nothing. At least a flouro or even heavy enough mono will have more resistance to there teeth.
666987,Live2fish85,2012-02-16 04:23:00,1633,Also don't know if you are set on catchin a pike or a fish if you just want a fish try for some Browns I am sure there are some browns in there and probably more willing to hit then a pike.
667029,strakey,2012-02-16 13:29:00,78,"When it comes to catching pike this time of year as any fish they are all sluggish due to the fact they are cold blooded. The colder the slower and vice versa to a point. Use a leader and slow down your presentation. Suspended baits, swim baits, jigs all will work. The little jetty at ontario place and boat dock on the other side all hold fish all season so keep tryin. My answer would be to get a big soft plastic swim bait/jig and fish it really slowly along bottom rpund 10 am and onward into the day"
667031,BillM,2012-02-16 13:37:00,17367," Have you ever considered the fact that it's the gin clear water that's causing this fish to be spooked?  If you can see them, they can see you!   Again, nothing to do with the leader, lol."
667032,Harrison,2012-02-16 13:38:00,2202,"Check out this new leader that may help you hook up with some of those finicky Lake O pike.  Very new to the market, I sold out very fast, but have more on order and coming soon.coming soon.  Small diameter and you can tie it directly to the hook.  Pike guys out west bought it all up.  http://www.tuf-line.com/products_Specialty-Lines_20.html  http://www.etackle.ca/tuf-line-leader-10-15-20-50-lb-5yrd/"
667117,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-16 17:42:00,65,"First off I want to really thank everyone for all the help I'm getting with this thread.  Thank-you!  Yeah that's what I thought before the handful of people advised against it.  I'll look into a thinner leader instead of the bulky ones I've been using, but still I'll be using one.    I knew there were trout, but unsure of how to target them.    Do you mean like dead slow dragging along the bottom for moments?  I find it hard to get the right speed where it's not draggin on the bottom.   "
667131,BillM,2012-02-16 18:34:00,17367," Dead bait under a float.  Boring, but it works."
666290,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-14 04:18:00,65,"My first report with a ""catch"" and with pictures for 2012.  I spent the afternoon today taking advantage of the warm weather.  Got to Ontario Place around 2pm.  Fished along the water in front of both parking lots trying to target pike.  I started with a big willow-blade spinner with a wire leader.  Another guy was fishing there as well.  I asked him for advice, he advised against the big spinnerbait and wire leader.  I donwsized to a spoon tied on directly.  I tried to cover the water as methodically as I could.  Eventually switched to a noname silver sinking swimbait (that I pulled off of a salmon in the Fall hahaha) featured in the picture.  I didn't see any action unfortunately.  So I'm dying to spend a day out there with somebody who knows what they're doing and is able to get reliable pike hits =D.  I did catch a crayfish, it has fish in the name at least =P.  This little buddy was a nice surprise.     Around 5pm I moved the car further east.  I found some free parking around the island air port.  From there I worked the Spadina Quay marina at the foot of Spadina avenue but no luck there either.   I fished into the dark, till about 7pm.  I started using a glow-in-the-dark spoon for a bit.  Anyway, I was glad to get a line wet.  Anticipated pike is always exciting, just wish I could spend some time with a seasoned vet to show me how it's done.  Also my rod (I think it's 6ft) didn't help on the casting front... should I invest in a proper length 10ft. or 12 ft. rod?  Would really help the action and casting i think."
666291,Live2fish85,2012-02-14 04:26:00,1633,Don't need a rod that long to cast just need a good rod and a better reel.
666315,Rizzo,2012-02-14 12:41:00,4754,advice: put the leader back on. Once you get it figured out and the fish start biting you will lose lures and pike may die without one.
666322,mike rousseau,2012-02-14 13:01:00,4661,My friends and I usually run 10.5 foot rods whe fishing from shore...  They cast a mile...  And you can cast parallel to the shoreline and keep your bait 10 feet off the shore for the whole retrieve... It's like trolling the shoreline...  Also prevents getting snagged right at the shoreline because your lifting your bait 10 feet out...
666394,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-14 17:36:00,65,"   Hmm, anyone else have thoughts about this?   Once I get the presentation figured out?   "
666398,BillM,2012-02-14 17:52:00,17367,"No, use the leader regardless.   Pike aren't leader shy."
666399,highdrifter,2012-02-14 17:55:00,2534, They are at Ontario Place..
666408,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-14 18:12:00,65, implying...?   
666412,BillM,2012-02-14 18:23:00,17367," I dunno man, pike aren't exactly picky fish.   Perhaps you need something a bit smaller then 130lb flouro leaders, but to tell someone to go leaderless for pike is only going to donate lures to the back of the fishes throat, or to the bottom of the lake."
666437,EC1,2012-02-14 19:49:00,930,Nicely done! I was thinking about going there to take a few casts since it never even froze over at all this year. These things are supposed to bite jerkbaits year round right?  Has anyone been in contact with the legendary SNAG lately? Would love to see what he's been up to with the downtown pike lately.
666448,captpierre,2012-02-14 20:28:00,2521,Used to fish the harbour and Islands.  The fish are there.  Likely sluggish with the cold water.  Try a suspending body bait like a Husky Jerk and twitch it real slow.  makes for monotonous fishing but should work
666454,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-14 20:59:00,698,Countdowns are your friend for winter habourfront pike
666489,highdrifter,2012-02-14 22:29:00,2534, JJJEEEEEAAH..  Ya think??!!
666490,highdrifter,2012-02-14 22:31:00,2534, 130lbs!!!
666508,steelhedrmatt,2012-02-14 23:22:00,278," I was going to suggest the same thing.  Although the weather has been fairly mild, the water is still quite cold.  Slow your presentation down.  Use suspending body baits, jerk like crazy a few times, then just let it sit there.  I haven't fished down there since I moved out of the city, but thats what we used to do.  Keep at it. There are some real monsters lurking around down there.  Also try the boardwalk in fron of old fort york.  Used to do well there also.  Good Luck!!"
666514,Live2fish85,2012-02-14 23:31:00,1633,If you do a bit of research on the fish you are targetig you will learn things and have a better chance of catching that species. It is well known that pike don't care what size line or leader you are really using. An as said not using a leader is only going to result in you losing lures possibly killing the fish and still.coming up empty handed.
666520,Lunatic,2012-02-14 23:47:00,536,mepps black fury are a good start. i know pike take them like candy in the spring. number 3 -5 (maybe add a twister tail on the hook) moving a husky jerk real slow is another.
666525,BillM,2012-02-14 23:54:00,17367," If I'm fishing for 40+ inch pike, I don't mess around!  LOL"
666544,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-15 00:41:00,65, I still don't get it.
666545,MichaelAngelo,2012-02-15 00:46:00,65," Well that's what he said, to go leaderless like he was.  He also said he had bites, and well, I didn't get bites.  This was my second day at this spot in the past week, and nothing.  That's not all, I recognized this guy from a picture on OFF holding some monster pike at this exact spot a month ago.  So I knew he meant it.  Getting nothing, so I gotta change something right?  Also, on the issue of leaders read on here:  http://www.ontariofishingforums.com/forum/topic/13587-pike-tips/page__view__findpost__p__223947  Mixed opinions indeed."
666556,BillM,2012-02-15 01:18:00,17367,It wasn't the leader that was causing you not to get fish....  Slow down your presentation and you'll get bit...
666561,Jigger,2012-02-15 01:28:00,1237,"There are many types of leader material. Some prefer a steel leader, some prefer Fluorocarbon. You should try them both and see if you can figure out which one you prefer in the end. The only thing thats going to sway your decision is success with one or the other."
666563,danc,2012-02-15 01:36:00,4677,I'd simply toss out a stinky oily dead bait such as a smelt or cisco on a quick strike rig. Let it sit on bottom and enjoy the day until your rod starts going nuts.
666565,Live2fish85,2012-02-15 01:38:00,1633,Like jigger said. Plenty of leaders. I never use a wire leader but I always use a leader. An like Bill said it isn't the leader causing you to get nothing.
666618,Toronto_Angler,2012-02-15 04:34:00,698,I would listen to Highdrifter. Pike and Bass at Harbour and Islands are unbelievably picky.
