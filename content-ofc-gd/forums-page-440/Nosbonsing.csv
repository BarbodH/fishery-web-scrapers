666615,Bassnbows,2012-02-15 04:29:00,58,Just wondering if it's worth a shot this weekand. And if there's any half decent Walleye's in there. Thanks
666638,Rod Caster,2012-02-15 11:54:00,5784,"Yes and yes. Every year, someone catches a 15lber from that lake. The walleye there are real thick and clean. It can be tough fishing, but that applies to any new lake."
666666,Mike the Pike,2012-02-15 13:47:00,3421,Yes tough fishing there as the fishing has declined over the years due to fishing pressure.  My mom lives 2kms from there in Bonfield.Good population of Pike Perch and Muskie though.  MTP

666933,Joeytier,2012-02-16 02:26:00,3990,You will catch walleye.  Pay attention to the slot and let the big girls go.  It gets fished heavy.
