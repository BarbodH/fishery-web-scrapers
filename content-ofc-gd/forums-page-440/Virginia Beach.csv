I have been lucky on Cook's Bay, but every time I go with my bro we only get dinky perch and maybe 1 jumbo. Any tips? I would really like to see him pull out some nice perch, by mid day of all dinks he gets mopey. I am not looking for your special spots if that is what you are thinking. I have never been to Virginia beach and any info is much appreciated.  Thanks."

I have been going up there for years, what I noticed is the jumbos start coming in later in the season.  I don't how this winter weather has affected the ice bite, but I am sure everything is delayed big time.  I would suggest looking for deeper water, on average you will find the deeper areas being around 8 feet, ideally try to fish 11 feet or deeper.  The majority of success I have had was on small spoons, jigs (mostly ones that I have tied) or tubes.   All tipped with shiners about 2""-3"".  When I went a couple of weeks ago we were given tiny shiners 1-1 1/2"" in length, which i think accounted for the number of dinks."
