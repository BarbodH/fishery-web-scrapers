Along with a couple of buddies I hit the frigid expanse of Lake Winnipeg in the pre-dawn darkness in search of big walleye. We found a subtle depth change adjacent to an area of pushed up ice. Action was furious before the sun made an appearance, a pink Lindy Darter was icing fish right and left. We followed the school around, drilling new holes as action dried up in old ones.  With daylight an hour old, the fish in that area turned off, we hit the road in search of active fish in a bit deeper water and again were rewarded....but not with out a bit of figuring. The fish would rush in on the Darter then turn away, after trying a number of baits to turn these lookers into biters we settled on a flutter spoon in a rainbow pattern. Some type of pink was definitely the order of the day.  Part way through the morning our heater died, the thermal fabric on the Clam Summit really made a difference, blocking the wind and keeping us warm....it was -36c with the windchill this morning. Having a quality portable hut, well organized gear and sharp auger blades kept us mobile and on top of the fish. Even in cold temperatures make the extra effort and you will be rewarded with more fish.      This is an unbelievable fishery, with huge numbers and HUGE fish possible, I would strongly suggest putting this on the list to do for an icefishing trip!"
