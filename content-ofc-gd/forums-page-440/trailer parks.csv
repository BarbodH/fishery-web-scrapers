666034,Nipfisher,2012-02-13 13:06:00,2449,You know my choices. For your tent trailer or are you going to upgrade? Try Land O' Lakes Campground beside Marten River Prov. Park.

666277,Nipfisher,2012-02-14 02:53:00,2449,  Not much on Hwy. 11 from New Liskeard to Temagami. Maybe on the Elk Lake Hwy (#65)? After Temagami there are a few around Marten River and Rabbit Lake area.
