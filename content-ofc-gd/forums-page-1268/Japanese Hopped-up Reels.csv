35439,danbo,2007-02-16 19:53:00,2646,"SCAAARRRRRYYY stufff, eh?  I gotta win a lottery to shop there!"
35446,Northhunter,2007-02-16 20:08:00,214,Wow. If I was to even manage to pick one out to buy I don't know if I'd get much fishing done after strapping it to the rod. I'd probably just stand there staring at it and mumbling like Ozzy.... on a good day
35453,danbo,2007-02-16 20:21:00,2646,All aboard the crazy train!
35465,Terry,2007-02-16 20:58:00,14456,you would be surprised just how many people buy that stuff
35471,barracuda,2007-02-16 21:07:00,41,"Lol, Brooklyn Bill is a good guy, have dealt with him before. Jun @ Japan Tackle is also known for being a great guy who treats his customers right. That said though, this year we're fortunate in North America to get many of the same reels as they have in Japan. Still significant variances though in some areas. Japanese versions of the Sol and Calcutta TE are still better than our's. Chronarch Bull have dif finishes. We still have a smaller selection of shimano/daiwa spinning reels. And there's still no Calais 101a to match the Antares AR.  As for price, it's not any more than high-end centerpins and their matching custom IMX.  "
35491,Rob,2007-02-16 21:50:00,467,  For that price he better treat you right!!
35554,mepps,2007-02-17 00:36:00,1301,one of my favorite sites!  I would be afraid to use those reels after spending the big bucks though!
35592,danbo,2007-02-17 03:13:00,2646,I'm with you Mepps! I've owned some expensive Flyrods over the years & just feel queazy using 'em! (Gimme an old Daiwa Heartland flyrod & I'll whip any salmon or bass with it! Lol.) I gotta Blue-collar mindset..always look for decent quality/price instead of buying the absolute best/expensive gear. It aint the gun..its the gunner!
