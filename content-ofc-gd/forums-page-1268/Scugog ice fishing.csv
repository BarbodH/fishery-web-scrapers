35748,fishindevil,2007-02-17 21:14:00,6254,"well those spots are good producers for mid-winter and the end of the season,i have had good luck at both spots with williams point,and oakdene point being the best so my advice would be to stay in those spots,at oakdene point try to find weed pockets in about 7-9ft of water, and try to find the eges of the weeds or holes im sorry i dont have the GPS,co-ordinates with me or i could give you those,well good luck cause those spots will produce just keep trying ....cheers"

Since you are already fishing the aforementioned areas, you are in a good position to answer your own question.  You are evidently clinging to the hope that one of our members will banish your sceptical premonitions, and allay your fears.  My advise is to abandon off the ""Bog"". I do not fish there cause I know from the feedback I've been reading, that it is chancy at best, and most people who fish there go for the same reason... it is the closest to the GTA. If you are hoping for Walleye, and can make b4 Feb 28, make the trip to Quinte. You can walk, if on a budget, to fish holding areas. If you want guaranteed (almost) Perch action go to the several locations on Simcoe. Hope this helps, Clampet"
