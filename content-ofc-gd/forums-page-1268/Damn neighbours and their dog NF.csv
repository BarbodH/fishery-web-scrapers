34918,davew3,2007-02-15 14:17:00,430,phone the bylaw or SPCA and tell them there is a threatening dog on your property and the owners refuse to do anything about it. Say you are worried about childrens welfare. Better yet have your wife call and be having a crying /scared fit!!! Say you want it removed !!!
34934,Hooked,2007-02-15 15:32:00,891,"Wow, finally got a post on fire.  haha.  Think I'll start with what Verno mentioned.  Funny thing is, when I bought this house 6 years ago, we met some people down the street, and they warned us about our neighbours.  As much as I love revenge, it would be too much of a headache to get back.  Though I would love to see the look on their face when they are handed a fine. Thanks again all for the ideas.  I didn't know so many of you are so evil."
34938,Entropy,2007-02-15 15:46:00,747,Remove the dog.  (for good)  Collect your poop and wipe it on their car door handle and door handle to their house.
34940,Nemo,2007-02-15 16:00:00,727,Lew that Leaf Story is hilarious. Your buddy was thinking and patient.  Hooked Verno is right It might be good also to be seen taking some photos of said pooch in action.
34942,Jigger,2007-02-15 16:18:00,1237,"Entropy beat me to it...Get a drywall scraper and wait for the dog to drop a big steamer, and stuff the doo under the handle of the car door. Wait until monday, its supposed to get to +9deg .  You can put it in the keyholes, door handles, welcome mat. Theres also the Grumpy old Men scene where Walter Matthou?sp? puts the dead fish in the back seat  you're going to use a substitute, of course  . The possibilities are endless, really. Good luck, man, and remember, revenge is a dish best served cold."
34951,Castmaster,2007-02-15 16:58:00,86,"Hey Hooked! If you don't video tape the final outcome of this situation, you're gonna have alot of dissapointed people around here. Oh please video tape it and put it up here for all to share in your glory!!! This is the funniest thread I've read on any site in a while!! "
35004,ketchenany,2007-02-15 19:46:00,3229,"Hooked, years ago I had the same problem and I kept telling them to clean up their act or i would call in bylaw inforcement. Well the proud owner came ove one day and said we should put a fnce between the two houses (with the prevvious neighbour here was no need for one, he carried a gun at work LOL)  And my reply was when are you going to start? and then I started laughing when he asked for half of the funds to build it, YOU WANT IT, YOU BUILD IT, YOU PAY FOR IT end of story, I got a fence and he had to move, even better . . .   :clapping:"
35056,ryanheritage,2007-02-15 22:06:00,180,"there is a by law the dog will be ""deemed at large"" and they will be fined. But the best thing would be to spray the mutt with some water in this freezing weather and watch him whine. Or wait with some fire works and the second that dog goes for a crunch give him a scare. If you retaliate to your neighbors they will just be ignorant. Make the dog scared of your property."
35065,samson,2007-02-15 22:40:00,8,get a bigger to eat their dog
35070,helmutt,2007-02-15 23:00:00,4,I will give you the most effective message for this neighbour.  Collect the frozen poo and place it in the lava rocks of their gas barbecue!  Nothing get someones attention better than sweetening their steaks with the fine aroma of their pooch!!
35091,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 23:50:00,1780,"LOL at these ideas. Maybe if you like dogs get a big one of your own to enforce your side of the lawn and train it to poo on their side.  Bookoobeast, your dog in the avatar looks friendly.  That's a great story Lew. What goes around comes around."
35107,Jigger,2007-02-16 00:20:00,1237,Helmutt wins
35116,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 00:26:00,876,"perhaps some antifreeze on a steak left on the lawn..... j/k   u shouldn't punish or hurt the dog cause their owners are idiots, if revenge is the route u choose  take it out on the owners please"
35129,Norpiker,2007-02-16 00:59:00,21,I second the opinion of Walleyejigger All the folks who wanted to do something to the dog should be ashamed. I'm surprised nobody wanted to shoot the dog..it seems like that is the answer to most situtaitons here
35132,Fisherman,2007-02-16 01:01:00,7201,"Exlax, it works."
35152,pigeonfisher,2007-02-16 01:37:00,696, I don't like this idea.  Shoot the new guy!  just kidding.
35371,Hellfish,2007-02-16 15:34:00,308,"First time reading the post, but why the he!! would u do anything to the dog it is just instinct to go back to the same spot, why dont u spary the owners with cold water and such but not the dog, im surprised i saw a couple of posts about doing shiat to the dog, hope yall who said that feel better about yourselfs."
35386,ryanheritage,2007-02-16 16:16:00,180,"I don't want to hurt the dog I just want to scare him. A wet cold dog is the worst thing in a house. It comes in jumps on the couch to get warm, tracks water and crap through the house.( by the sounds of your neighbors they need that) A good scare will keep that dog in his yard or at least close to his front door."
35395,Hellfish,2007-02-16 16:56:00,308,"  So in this weather what u going to do fill a bucket and chuck it at em?? maybe use the hose??? I dunno maybe itz just me but the dog should be deemed innocent, knowing me i would have smacked that neighbour out already but not worth getting the cops called on ya. I really do like the flamming bag of crap idea, or the shiat under the handles of the doors and house, maybe chuck the poo on their porch or walk way. I dunno itz summin i def would have alot of fun with though, good luck."
35412,Mike Pike,2007-02-16 18:05:00,1332,"As a temporary fix, Hooked, I can personally vouche for the cayenne pepper which was mentioned earlier.  I just mix mine up with some red pepper flakes as well.  I had a dog that kept dumping on my lawn in a couple of different places.  So, I mixed up some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper and sprinkled it where the dog would do it's business PLUS I sprinkled a boarder all around my lawn.  I did this every couple of weeks for a few months and the offending beast never returned."
35548,fishindevil,2007-02-17 00:20:00,6254,"yes i think vernos plan will work,keep track of every time the dog does it or better yet get a video,of the dog having a dump,and the owner not doing anything about it.....good luck   cheers"
34860,lew,2007-02-15 11:58:00,12767,"My buddy had a tiny dog about 5 pounds that never left the yard, and he also had a very nasty old lady living next door to him and they'd fought for years.  One day he saw the old girl pick up a shovel full of dog dirt from her yard and toss it over the fence onto his front lawn. He ran out and asked what she was doing, and she said....... ""I don't have a dog, so this mess must be yours""....... even though his tiny pooch couldn't possibly be the offender.  The old girl had a huge maple tree on her property and buddy had no trees.  In the fall, half the leaves from her tree fell on his property and he went out and raked them up as he always did and filled about 10 bags with leaves and then just waited.  Eventually, the old girl decided to rake her leaves and spent all day cleaning up her property and  also filled about 10 bags and placed them at the curb for pick-up.  The next day, buddy took all his leaves next door and dumped them all over her nicely cleaned property. She saw what he'd done and came running over in a rage and asked what the he!! he was doing.  He just said....""I don't have a tree, so this mess must be yours"".....and walked away  There's always a way to get even  Buddy's been dead for many years now but I laff everytime I think of that story."
34861,Motorhead,2007-02-15 12:12:00,163,"I would call by-law as stated above... I good friend of mine is a by-law officer in Halton and he loves handing out fines to people that don`t clean up after their dogs, (even on their own property)  it`s not a cheap fine if I remember right.. Make sure to let us know what route you go...  Doug"
34873,Randy,2007-02-15 12:46:00,115,"Hooked, I agree with what Verno has suggested. You may also want to hound your  Municipal Councillor if you can't get any action directly from the City."
34875,JEREMY,2007-02-15 13:09:00,300,I have a very large dog you could borrow for a few weeks fill himfull of prune juice and let him loose.Or just pick up the dog pooh and throw it at their window with a shovel of course.I am pretty sure that if you throw  pooh at the window a few times it will stop.  or you could try the jerry springer show.
34894,just2manylures,2007-02-15 13:40:00,144,Wasn't there a Seinfeld eposide that dealt with a similar issue.  Call Kramer and Newman and your problems will be solved.  my 2 cents  2many
34903,Sherriff,2007-02-15 13:48:00,252,"Hooked, call me if you need it.  I have all the doggie poo you want.  Big and small.  Shepard brand and boston terrier poop.  Lots to choose from. Always looking for better ways to get rid of the poop so you can have it....  Sherriff"
