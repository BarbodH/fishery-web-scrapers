35029,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 21:11:00,1780,"It took 5 weeks in the mail due to the horrible weather to get the parts but they finally came, my musky cabin fever is on full tilt so I got to work on some bucktails and marabous. I built them with thick .63 wire and epoxied all the layers of thread, mustad hooks, # 8 blades, and the biggest one has the magnum #10 blades, got enough to make about 40-50 for now, I've made bucktails in the past but it's my first time dealing with the marabou and hackle feathers, I would sleep on them if they were hook-less.    7 3/4"", 1.5oz    9"", 2 1/4oz    11"", 3oz    13"", 4oz    Now I will have a few boxes of marabous like Lew.  And the wait for musky season begins."
35045,kennyman,2007-02-15 21:45:00,737,That last one is a BIG bait
35046,crusty,2007-02-15 21:45:00,83,"I'll take one of each, How much?"
35067,muskiebobsr,2007-02-15 22:43:00,49,Very good looking baits.. I also make them but not the same as yours.  Mine are smaller but they do work.  I see one there that I know will take fish in Clair.  I see your from G Bay.  I fished there in 85 and would love to come back there. I just wanted to say what a nice looking bait they are.  Bob
35069,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 22:58:00,1780,"Sent you a PM Crusty.  Thanks Bob, you should make a trip back to GB there are some nice fish out here, but it's tough fishing, you're lucky if you can raise 1 Muskie in a day but there usually big and I love hunting them. I like the small ones and big ones, those big ones can cast or troll,  I like trolling the big ones."
35157,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-16 01:49:00,2585,nice!  Looks like you had some fun!  Cheers!
35163,pigeonfisher,2007-02-16 01:59:00,696,"Just vertically jig them.  I have heard that Musky Stew is better with winter fish, lots of meat!"
35166,Pigeontroller,2007-02-16 02:04:00,2793,Looks like you did a nice job!
35167,silveradosheriff,2007-02-16 02:04:00,1025,Awesome Baits!
35186,Weeds,2007-02-16 02:38:00,782,Wow! One more vote for nice looking baits!
35191,GbayGiant,2007-02-16 02:43:00,1780, Don't get it ? I've never killed or ate a musky of any size.  Do they taste good ?
35206,brickNblock,2007-02-16 03:31:00,598,"GBay.......... Very nice indeed Bud..they'll get you a few decent fish. We have a very similar stlye in choice of material and the construction of them. You should do very well with those babies.  How are you bending the wire for the loop..that is a thick gauge.   Ive gone through easily a dozen  needle nose pliers,  even though the first bend and wrap I bend with my fingers. I use to use the .051 and when you have a decent fish on it can bend your bait beyond repair so I found you must go to the higher gauge as you have. Next question....are you weighting them and if so how much?........shoot me a PM if you're gaurding the secret. Great looking Baits. -peter"
35212,GbayGiant,2007-02-16 03:55:00,1780,"Hey Peter, If you look at my loops they are not round like usual, but just as good. I bend the wire into a U shape than put it into a vise, bend the top of the U back towards myself, than use small vise-grip pliers to clamp onto the tip of the wire and just pull it around a couple times and cut the extra wire off. (if that makes sense, watch the hooks you don't want to slip  I don't know the exact weight because the digital scales I used were in pounds only, so I'll have to pull out the smaller gram scales to get exact weight, but they are very close to what I put above the pictures. They are tied on 1/2oz spring coils, then I add lead weight if I want a little more."
35261,lew,2007-02-16 10:18:00,12767,"VERY VERY impressive indeed, John !!  Looks like you've done an excellent job and those should put some nice fish in your boat this year.  Now you need to build a boo-box to hold them all  BTW, I bought another boo yesterday at the show.......brown with brass, I think it'll work well."
35329,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-16 13:55:00,0,Nice job !!!!  It is fun eh !!!  My next venture is to buy some marabou as well.  Thanks for posting.
35429,GbayGiant,2007-02-16 19:37:00,1780,"Thanks guys.  Yes Lew I will need a boo-box, I have some lexan I was thinking of using or I might do the cheap milk crate idea."
35901,danbo,2007-02-18 06:23:00,2646,Great lookin' ammo there John!  Now make one ta look like a crappie & you're all set!
35945,Rich Clemens,2007-02-18 13:47:00,3131,Some hoT lookin' baits there John.  Nice selection with various sizes and weights.   I'm sure we'll be seeing some nice pics on what these babies will land.
35947,Jigger,2007-02-18 13:54:00,1237,NIIIICE!
