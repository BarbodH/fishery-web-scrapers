I was fishing a large lake 45 minutes north of Peterborough.  I was targeting perch, using small spoons tipped with power bait grubs and such. This combo has worked so far this year, keeps me from getting skunked but just barely. Next time I'll be sure to get some live bait. Cut about 20 holes in all, ice was a weak 8 inches in some areas, solid 12+ in others. Glad I didn't drive onto the lake, as per usual this time of the year. Had a few hits, only landed one. It came in the first 30 minutes, in 20 FOW about 6 ft from bottom. Solid strike. Jig came out as the head of this guy pops into the hole. Luckily he couldn't figure out how to turn himself around. Iced it, as I thought I might get another couple. Nope. Was a great way to pass the time on a Friday afternoon. Good luck to those going out this weekend.    Cheers, pooch"
