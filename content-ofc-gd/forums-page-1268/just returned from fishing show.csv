35793,fishergirl72,2007-02-18 00:30:00,455,"Hey Slowpoke, Our daughter caught the trout on a hook and a power grub, but needless to say that Fishindevil was off talking to someone while my daughter and I were out at the trout pond and she only had her line in the water not even 5 minutes and she hooked one, well that made her day. What made my day is we had a great time at the show with the family and I bought a pair of designer sunglasses and a charm braclet for myself and I met some awesome people!   It was great to see Nautifish at the show!"
