35780,mercforever,2007-02-18 00:01:00,67,Just wondering if anybody's fished that way recently and if they sell minnows that way??? thanks in advance......
35790,pidge,2007-02-18 00:20:00,438,"Yup just got back an hour ago. Landed one pike, and lost 2. All on my new tip up I picked up yesterday at the show. And yes they do sell minnows."
35795,Weeds,2007-02-18 00:38:00,782,"Pidge, how big was the one you got?"
35804,pidge,2007-02-18 01:16:00,438,"Never had a tape, but I'd honestly say about 20 inches long. All the pike I have ever pulled out of that lake were all around that size. I'v never herd of any one pulling one out much bigger."
35805,Clampet,2007-02-18 01:18:00,1947,Pike are good eating.
