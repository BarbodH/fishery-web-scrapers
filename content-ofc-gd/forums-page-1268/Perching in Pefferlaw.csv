Wants to go again,now!He had a blast catching some perch,he got about 6 and even more fun playing in the snow.Me well between baiting 2 or 3 rods for 5 hours and catching about a dozen myself i'd say the best part was him having so much fun.I want to go again,now!Took the camera but for whatever reason i would not stay on.(cold?)Thought it was the batteries but when we got home it worked fine.Oh well there is always next time. As a side note the operator was decent,took us out on time and had people check on us twice in 5 hours.My only complaint and it's minor was he wouldn't pick us up at 2:00 it had to be noonish or 4ish.I wanted to beat the rush hour back to Toronto thought 2pm would be a good time.Ah well we still beat the traffic leaving a 12:30."
