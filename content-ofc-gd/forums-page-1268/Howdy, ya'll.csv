Man, what a difference from the old dial up, wow, you folks are really in trouble now.  A big thank you to those who kept in touch with me during my absence.  Hey, Mr. De La Cruz!!! nice pic on page 41 of the Outdoor Canada Fishing Special, and on their 35th anniversary to boot. How nice is that? Please try to remember us little people.....  Maureen, I dont know if I'll be able to come to next weekend, could you send me a pm with your mailing address so I can send a donation to your worthy cause.  Been out on the new (to me) sled a bit, thats a lot of fun, and I'm even legal!! Insurance, trail pass, valid tags.....man, I must be getting old.  So I guess I need to go do some fishing  Anybody ever hear from KyleM?  How much drama did I miss?  See ya"
