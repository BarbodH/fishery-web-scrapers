35672,Kawartha Kev,2007-02-17 14:28:00,281,This makes no sense!!!!
35724,Carp,2007-02-17 18:56:00,1488,"I guess the ""2 cents"" phrase is getting on in age.  With inflation, I think opinions should be worth at least a dime.  So,....""That's my dime!"""
35732,Roy,2007-02-17 19:39:00,13728,"Meaning: 	To state one's opinion. Example: 	If I can put my two cents in, maintenance on that Ferrari will kill you. Origin: 	""Put my two cents in"" originates from the older ""put my two bits in"" and has its origin in the game of poker.  When playing poker you have to make a small bet before the cards are dealt called an ""ante"" to begin play in that hand.  This phrase draws an analogy to the poker ante (two bits) and gains your entry into the conversation.  Thanks to Evelyn and Dawn Rambin and Ron Akers  Two bits means one quarter (currently the American twenty five cent piece).  This comes from the older term ""piece of eight"".  Today we have coins minted in different denominations - nickel, dime, and quarter in the U.S. - but this was not always so.  Gold and silver coins once served as currency, with the value of the coin equal to the value of the gold or silver contained in the coin.  To obtain currency valued at less than a full gold coin, coins would be scored and split into pieces.   This is how one would make change so to speak.  Coins could be split into halfs, quarters, and eighths.  One eighth of a coin was called a ""piece of eight"" and also called a ""bit"".  Two pieces of eight is equal to one quarter.   Hence ""two bits"" is a quarter.  Thanks to William M. Gatesman and Michael Welzien  Hence ""Smashed to bits"" literally means to break something into eighths.    So, who cares?"
35740,SlowPoke,2007-02-17 20:39:00,2984," So, according to your etymology.... Your two cents is only worth a fraction of my two-bit opinion. Which brings me to my next point - opinions are like asses... they all stink. -Brian"
35742,Roy,2007-02-17 20:43:00,13728,I guess I'll have to ask you cause I wouldn't know what those things smell like.
35745,Carp,2007-02-17 21:05:00,1488,Play nice boys.  .....but that was a nice comeback Roy.
35750,SlowPoke,2007-02-17 21:18:00,2984,"Ooops, didn't mean to be a personal shot at Roy but at opinions in general.  I don't think Roy took it too personaly... he would have deleted it. Okay, now that was a shot at Roy"
35751,Roy,2007-02-17 21:28:00,13728,Hey Slowpoke....you're a nice guy.
35468,snag,2007-02-16 21:05:00,1932,"""My 2 cents""  Can we kill this phrase.  I'm sick of reading it.   Perhaps I'm just an obsessive compulsive.    (O.k I had some time to kill right now)  Oh crap, I need to go fishing. This is pathetic.  But seriously,  No more 2 cents"
35473,verno,2007-02-16 21:07:00,178,That sounds like a nickels worth of free advice.
35474,Rich,2007-02-16 21:07:00,3927,"From now on we say ""Thats just my bag of peanuts"""
35477,Puckhead,2007-02-16 21:09:00,377,touche!
35478,Puckhead,2007-02-16 21:10:00,377,That doesn't read well without the accent does it?
35480,snag,2007-02-16 21:22:00,1932,"Disclaimer  I would like to add that in no way did I intend on offending any 2 centers out there.  It may be stuck in your signature, or you really only have 2 cents, or you had 3 cents but did not want to be over-bearing. Some of you toss out bills of opinions.  We can't all have 2 cents. It just doesn't add up.  By the time a hot thread reaches 4 pages there's like,  .24 to .80 cents.  That's not spare change at that point.  That's almost a small coffee of hardened opinions.  Just.........be reasonable."
35486,ccmtcanada,2007-02-16 21:39:00,7971,"I heard on 680 news yesterday that the Canadian gov't was looking at eliminating the penny.  Apparently it costs  over a 100 million a year to keep it in circulation.  The news guy said...""I guess we cant say that's my 2 cents....it's gotta change to that's my nickel"""
35489,pikehunter,2007-02-16 21:49:00,1659,2 cents 2 cents 2 cents 2 cents 2 cents 2 cents 2 cents  ...just getting my moneys worth.  Holy crap! Do we all have cabin fever or what? A thread that is worth less than a 2 cent opinion! 
35490,Whopper,2007-02-16 21:50:00,2174,"OK snag I'll make a deal with ya I promise not to add my nickel's worth anymore if you promise not start ""Mepps threads"" like you did the other day.  As Howey would say ""DEAL OR NO DEAL""    Whopper"
35497,snag,2007-02-16 22:08:00,1932," Deal,  It was a little disturbing.  I can't touch finger foods anymore."
35498,snag,2007-02-16 22:10:00,1932, It's really is a stupid thread.  I'm quite embarrased.  Thanks for participating!
35501,steve_paul,2007-02-16 22:16:00,658,"Snag, just my 2 cents worth, your avatar scares the crap out of me and reminds me of one of my inlaws...  "
35505,Rich Clemens,2007-02-16 22:31:00,3131,My 2 cents from the USA is not really 2 cents ... just a hair bit more.  So I guess that don't count ... or is it too insignificant to worry about
35525,highdrifter,2007-02-16 23:03:00,2534,"Actually Grant, 2 cents would be translated into 0.02, or a dollar amount.   For this thread count to add up to 0.80, you'd need 40 replies...  And well... that would be down right nutty.  GNAWWW  Juste mes $0.02."
35529,Nemo,2007-02-16 23:18:00,727,.02$ then....
35530,kemper,2007-02-16 23:22:00,2232,"So its your 2 cents, that me saying its my 2 cents is no good...  Well, together we have 4 cents."
35535,Puckhead,2007-02-16 23:38:00,377, hahaha...
35544,steve_paul,2007-02-17 00:15:00,658, you wouldn't see so much humour in that if you saw her in the morning  
35545,Castmaster,2007-02-17 00:16:00,86,I am now stupider having read this.
35549,steve_paul,2007-02-17 00:24:00,658," ahhh, typical cabin fever symptom, take 2 advil, go to a fishing show, send Snag 1/50th of a loonie and you will be all better..."

35658,snag,2007-02-17 13:14:00,1932," Brian,  I'm glad to see you are able to spare some change at work again! I was at work and bored when this dumb thread arose."
