35567,Dondorfish,2007-02-17 01:21:00,1000,Haven't been down to the ramp - but most of this area is under 2 feet of snow! - Can't see it being accessable without some major hand work. The main roads are fine but the side streets are now starting to be plowed - don't think I would want to try the hill down to the launch!   Sorry to rain ( well - snow! ) on your parade but its better to know the facts   Don
