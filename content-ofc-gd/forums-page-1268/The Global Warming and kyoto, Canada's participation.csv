Yes I realize that something probably has to be done in regard to global warming but why do we always start at the bottom.  I really don't think that the rest of the real world will follow Canada's example.   The Kyoto horror show  While the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters take a pass, Canada gets clobbered  By LORRIE GOLDSTEIN     Here's my list of the ""top 10"" problems with the Kyoto accord on global warming. Feel free to add your own.  1) The United States, the world's biggest man-made greenhouse gas emitter -- 20.6% of all global emissions as of 2000 -- refuses to participate, arguing it would irreparably damage its economy and makes no demands on the developing world.  2) China, the world's second-biggest emitter (14.8%), is exempt from reducing greenhouse gases because it's a developing country.  3) The 27-member European Union, collectively the world's third-biggest emitter (14%), undeservedly benefits from the economic collapse of East Germany following the meltdown of the Soviet Union in 1989, not because of anything East Germany ever did to reduce greenhouse gases.  4) Similarly, Russia -- the world's fourth-biggest emitter (5.7%) -- undeservedly benefits from having huge ""emission credits"" to sell to other countries, not because of anything it did to reduce greenhouse gases, but because its economy also collapsed around 1990 (Kyoto's base year) after the fall of the Soviet Union.  5) India, the world's fifth-biggest emitter (5.5%), is exempt because it's also a developing country.  6) Australia, the world's biggest per-capita emitter of carbon dioxide due to its heavy reliance on coal, refuses to participate in Kyoto. Even if it did, it would be allowed to increase its emissions by 8%.  This as opposed to Canada, a big, cold, sparsely populated, northern country -- necessitating the burning of more fossil fuels -- which must reduce its emissions under Kyoto by 6% compared to 1990, by 2012.  COAL FIRED PLANTS  7) Almost 850 coal-fired energy plants planned by China (562), India (213) and the U.S. (72) over the next few years -- none covered by Kyoto -- will pump an estimated five times more carbon dioxide into the air than Kyoto removes, even if every other country hits its 2012 emission targets, which they won't.  8) Canada, which produces 2.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions making us the world's ninth-biggest emitter, is 35% behind our 2012 Kyoto target due to years of inaction by the previous Liberal government -- which locked us into the treaty -- followed by a year of inaction by the Tories.  But even if we were to hit our target, which would mean savaging our economy and spending billions buying ""hot air"" from places like Russia, it would have no significant impact on global emissions, for the reasons cited above.  9) Kyoto is mainly about transferring wealth from the first world to the third through the purchase of ""emission credits"" and the like, not reducing greenhouse gases.  10) Kyoto's unenforceable.  Finally, do Canadians support Kyoto? Our national media seem to think so, based largely on a recent Globe/Strategic Counsel poll, which asked people whether we should ""try"" to achieve our Kyoto targets. That received a 63% to 30% favourable response. But surely, Canadians believe we should ""try"" to do many things. Whether we're willing to make unfair sacrifices in a doomed effort, is the real question.  Interestingly, when The Strategic Counsel asked the same people if they supported charging ""significantly higher prices"" for gasoline and heating their homes -- a far more relevant question -- the vote was 64% to 34% against.  A CanWest/Innovative Research poll which was in the field at almost the same time as The Strategic Counsel, found about seven in 10 respondents agreed with the statement: ""I don't care whether the new federal government implements Kyoto or not, so long as they take real action to make our environment better."" Hmmm.  The serious issue here is whether Canada's three opposition parties are crazy enough to force an election on implementing this worthless, unfair treaty.  If I was Prime Minister Stephen Harper, I'd be saying to Liberal leader Stephane Dion and the rest of them: ""Go ahead, make my day.""  Then I'd campaign on a ""made-in-Canada"" policy setting hard caps for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the energy and transportation sectors, while taking a chunk of the money we now spend subsidizing big energy companies and auto giants and using it to help people retrofit their homes.  Finally, I'd tell voters what's really in the Kyoto accord.  Diabolical, I know."
36015,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-18 16:49:00,2585,here is the problem i have with this thing.  There is a negative impact on the economy with this.  But why should canadians that are number 9 on the list be involved?  Why not China who has 1 billion people and a big chuck of the manufacturing jobs in the world be the focus to lower there emmisions.  maybe force companies to come back to north america to manufacturer goods so we can rebuild our suffering manufacturing industry?

Tennesse won`t be warm enough for a move there, dang the big T on the hat can be for tequilla?, Florida under water.  Who knows, look at the disaster movies, we wait for something bad to happen before we do anything.  Dudes in Washington probably think Kyoto is an import car, surprized they didn`t jump on it.LOL  Political? survival?"
