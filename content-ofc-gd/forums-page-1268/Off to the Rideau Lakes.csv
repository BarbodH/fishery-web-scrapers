35999,Eddyk,2007-02-18 16:11:00,195,"Well I finally sold my house. Im moving Mar.17 to a small village called Delta in the heart of the Rideau lakes. There are lakes at both sides of the village and a river runs right through the village. There are also about 10 other lakes within a 10 minute drive. I was told the population of Delta is 97. I hope the rush hour traffic isnt to bad. I can carry my canoe from my backyard to one lake and the other lake is a 5 minute walk fom my house. There is a Camp ground on this lake and I can rent a spot for my boat for the whole season. One more thing. Theres 3 stores in the village,a grocery store, a beer and liquor store and the LONGHORN SALOON. Sounds like heaven doesnt it."
