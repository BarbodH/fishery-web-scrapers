It was getting windy so we went back in the marina got a few hits but the only fish that was caught was by my bro in laws freind, just a rock bass. We went down to Port Maitland pier and erie was frozen and so was the whole pier.   Here's a pic f a frozen fish we seen in the ice culdn't really make it out but it looked like a walleye or sheepshead.  People down at the marina  Moved out onto the grand, drilling the holes  I wiped out  The rock bass  Port Maitland pier  I wiped out again. lol "
35773,Greencoachdog,2007-02-17 23:40:00,8163,Great pics!!! Better luck next time!... Looks like it's just a tad on the nippy side up there!  Y'all would really be screwed if we didn't have global warming.
35774,GbayGiant,2007-02-17 23:47:00,1780,"Hard to say what that fish is, doesn't really look like a Walleye to me but I don't know, you should have chipped it out and ate it, probably still good."
35779,xrap,2007-02-17 23:57:00,683,  It doens't look to much like a walleye in the pic more of a sheepshead. There's was blood all over the tale was well if you can see it in the pic
35788,GbayGiant,2007-02-18 00:19:00,1780,I was thinking it looked like a sucker too.
35792,xrap,2007-02-18 00:24:00,683,"  Hey clampet we were using minnows the whole day. Jigged them, put them under a float, pikerel rig. And no success. I was using live bait the whole time but they started jigging and getting a few hits. I got a nice bit eon the float, so I started running and i fell and by the time i got to the hole it was gone. Oh well still was fun to get out"
35799,Clampet,2007-02-18 00:47:00,1947,"I stand corrected. You did yer best, and fer that I salute you.  For those about to Rock (fish) We salute you For those about to Rock..... We  salute ... you (AC/DC)  But you knew that."

36019,majorlifts,2007-02-18 17:00:00,171,"Cool pics guys, That is kinda weird that fish just frozen there like that. My mother had a similar experience in BC but it was some guy under the ice who fell through and was taken by the current. Bizzaro stuff man.  Looked fun anyways. I like the thrill of the hunt, trying to find those fish can sometimes be tough."
