36079,mattyk,2007-02-18 21:25:00,2110,"I have narrowed down my choices for a muksie reel to two specific reels, but i cant decide between then two of them so i need some input from the muskie pros.  I will be using this reel for big bucktails and spinnerbaits  with big blades, and baits will most likely weigh more than 2oz.  1)Shimano Calcutta CT400B Baitcast Reel. Geer Ratio of 5.0:1, line capacity of 14 LB/260 YDS and $219.99 USD. 4-bearing system (3 ball + 1 roller bearing) weight - 11.7 OZ  2)Abu Garcia Ambassadeur Record Baitcast Reels RCN60HC with drilled power handle. Geer ratio 5.3:1, line capacity 14 LB/245 YDS price $149.95 USD also 6 bearing system featuring 4 corrosion-resistant ball bearings and 2 roller bearings 13.3 OZ  So what do you guys think? Which one should i go for?  Or is there a better reel in your opnion? Thanks."

You just have to keep in mind that with the lower gear ratio you have to work a bit harder to burn baits, but the payoff is well worth the effort.  Just my 5 Â¢ though"
36088,muskymatt,2007-02-18 22:11:00,2608,"Go with what Lew said, the calcutta is a great reel.  I also like the abu 7000 , it will troll great as well  The record had mixed reviews.  Matt"
36091,wingman,2007-02-18 22:24:00,16,"Calcutta. Got one myself, it's a very good reel."
36097,mepps,2007-02-18 22:35:00,1301,I have a slightly smaller Calcutta and I cannot say enough good things about the product.
36100,mattyk,2007-02-18 22:42:00,2110,Looks like i have my answer. Thanks all for taking the time to respond. I will be picking up my new reel this week.
36131,seeking54,2007-02-19 00:03:00,11,Would anybody have recommended the Abu Morrum if they still made it?
36139,glen,2007-02-19 00:24:00,2641,I was looking at the Abu Garcia Ambassadeur Record Baitcast Reels RCN60HC also.  It looks very nice.  Has anyone used this reel?
