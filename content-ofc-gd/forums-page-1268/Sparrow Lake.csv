35761,Mattitude,2007-02-17 22:29:00,155,I have a trip planned for this Tuesday morning out to Sparrow Lake.  Just wondering if anyone has heard any reports or been out there.  Hoping to get into some pickeral or pike.  Thanks all. P.S.  there will be a report with pics too regardless if we get skunked or not.

35921,b2kptbo,2007-02-18 12:32:00,1505,A friend lives up that way and tells me the pickeral are hot and cold but a good chance for pike and perch. Good luck...
