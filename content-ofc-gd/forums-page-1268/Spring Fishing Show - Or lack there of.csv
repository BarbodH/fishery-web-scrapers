But I guess unless the lower their prices we won't see too many smaller, up and coming guys there. I did notice the celebs were especially good with the kids there. Tons of kids there today. They were all very eager to talk to the kids, so kudos to them for that. Saw Aaron and Barry, Italo, Shaun Rickard, Dave Mercer, Big Jim, Izumi et al. They were all pressing the flesh quite a bit (exception to Izumi) and doing their part. Was fun, but I bought nothing. THe only thing I needed no one had. My luck."

For that, I got my goody bag which included a battery tester, a nice spinnerbait, a nice patch, a few stickers, the usual OFAH stuff which includes 10 issues of OOD's...don't know how you can go wrong.  I actually had a good look at the baits at JB's and got a few ideas to make some more baits.  My marabou comes on Monday.     Had a nice chat with Pete Bowman, Dave Mercer and the folks from Muskies Canada.  Met up with Ron in the kids zone and he made a couple of worm harnesses for the boys.  Great seeing you again Ron.    Also had a nice chat with Loonietoon.  Had a look at several nice boats as well.  I mainly went to chat with folks and look forward to the upcoming softwater season......and I did.  Not sure what folks expect for $12, but whatever...."

Ontario is usually well represented with Camps and Lodges.  It has become more of a flea market than an outdoor show, for the outdoors man here the only smart move is the time of year, another 2 months and the crowds would be a lot smaller.  Has it changed? I think so, seems to be more stuff there every year that isn`t really outdoor related."
35960,TJQ,2007-02-18 14:38:00,7806,"Well...  the show was pretty much a duplicate of last year... now this doesnt mean im dissapointed... what can they really do dfferent..  I got to speak to a few OFNers.. but I missed alot.. have to see ya'll in June.  That being said we didnt spend much dough at the show, I was saving up for Averys  first surf and turf... lol.  I did get to see a dozen or so clients and had a quick chat with this guy  http://www.salmofishinglures.com  I was really impressed with  the selection of his stuff.  I yakked with Dave and Shaun and Blake and by 2 oclock or so Avery had had more than enough lol..  so we called it a day.  Then we bumped into Joey and Paul on the way out, had a quick chat and then back to the hotel.  On the way home today!"
