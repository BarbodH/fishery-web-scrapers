So, now I can share some of my many Nascar adventures south of the border, & even some from right here in Ontario.  Every year around this time (just before Daytona) I browse through my pictures, & relive them all. Now, I don't really know where to start, so this may come out at random. You'll find the pics are mostly revolvong around Dale Earnhardt, AKA ""The Intimidator"", or AKA ""The Man"".  I guess I'll start with my first race, the Goodwrench 400 at Michigan International Speeday, in August 1994. We got our tickets really late, & got stuck with row 1. These are great seats for getting covered in rubber, but not so good for seeing the whole 2 mile track.  The pace lap...    I was hooked on Nascar since '86, but after my first 'live' experience, I knew I had to get back to the track. I didn't get back to a race until July '96, the Miller 500 at Pocono Raceway. Here's a couple of pics...      In 1997 and 1998, I did the August double-header, Watkin's Glen followed by Michigan. Man, what a tiring 2 weeks, not to mention expensive...      Here's some random pics from The Bud at The Glen...      The Man...    While I wish this one was the #3 car, I'm still really proud that it came out so well. Jimmy 'Mr. Excitement' Spencer was also the first Nascar autograph I ever got...      I also made a day trip down to The Glen for the Craftsman Truck Series. Here's Mike Skinner in a familiar looking ride...    Some pics from Michigan...          For Joey...      Poor Uncle Mikey....        Dale passing Victory Lane during qualifying...    For Mike (eh)...      Different year...    We always had a great view. I had the same seats for 5 years before I gave them up...    Dale comin' in...    Dale goin' out.....     It's common knowledge that Nascar boasts the most loyal of all sports fans. They'd show up at the tracks driving awesome vehicles...       This will be continued in Part 2.
