35881,huntervasili,2007-02-18 04:39:00,1604,wouldnt want that jumping out at me on a card...  couldn't help it But yea it does have a cool effect
35888,irishfield,2007-02-18 04:49:00,26272,Is that his head swelling from all that magazine exposure? LOL
35890,bpsbassman,2007-02-18 04:56:00,941,"You're a funny guy Wayne Very cool Rick (other than my swollen head) Is there any way you could get the Musky to look over 50"" so I can complete another one of my ""50 Things to do Before I Die""??"
35893,danc,2007-02-18 05:01:00,4677,That is such an awesome photo!!
35900,danbo,2007-02-18 06:20:00,2646,WAY COOL!
35918,lew,2007-02-18 12:03:00,12767,"Good stuff Rick, you made an awesome picture even better.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think that's the best picture that's ever been posted on this board. Never seen any other photograph that exemplifies what fish'n is all about, more than that one.  Rogers smile tells the whole tale !!"
35919,b2kptbo,2007-02-18 12:19:00,1505,"Very cool, I like it..."
