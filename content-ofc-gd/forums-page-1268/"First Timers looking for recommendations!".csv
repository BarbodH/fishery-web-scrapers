35586,jenerous,2007-02-17 02:44:00,1,Hi Everyone Looking to go do some ice fishing in Ontario for Perch & Walleye!  Has anyone gone there recently?  Looking for resort or lodge on a lake (where perch & walleye fishing are good).  Any recommendations on a four season resort!  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks Jenerous

I would suggest Nippissing, given that it has both species plus whitefish and a variety of accomodations.  If you want larger walleye, the Bay of Quinte is the #1 choice. There is no place that I can suggest that would have an outstanding lodge, with a couple of bed and breakfasts being as close as it gets.  Both suggestions have various guides, etc.  outdoorguy61"
