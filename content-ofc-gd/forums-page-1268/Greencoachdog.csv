35229,kemper,2007-02-16 04:49:00,2232,Looks like a loonie to me! only thing missing is the dang duck
35233,muskiebobsr,2007-02-16 04:54:00,49,The Mint must need money.  I wonder how much they are going to charge for them.  LOL
35260,Greencoachdog,2007-02-16 10:16:00,8163,"I think they're more of a collectors item than anything, and they never go over too well. Vending machines won't take them, there isn't any place for them in a cash register drawer, and they're just too dang heavy to carry around... but maybe these will replace the dollar bill... I don't think so!"
35284,b2kptbo,2007-02-16 13:00:00,1505," Had the same deal up here, if they want your money watch how fast they change..."
35305,tjsa,2007-02-16 13:23:00,1578,"The vending machine and cash register companies will re-tool their coin slots really fast, and just bump up their prices a bit to offset the cost of the reconfiguration. But the coins do last a lot longer than the bills, and that saves the whole economy a lot of money. There will be counterfeits of course, but thats no different than the bills.  Carrying coins in your pocket is not that big of a deal, at least not to me."
35317,hawkeye,2007-02-16 13:42:00,162,"and this morning I read a report that Canada should ditch the penny, but that the US is to conservative to go that route.  Now if the US would come out with a $5 coin maybe Canada would follow  heads I win tails you loose"
35322,OhioFisherman,2007-02-16 13:50:00,6623,LOL on the bright side your pockets will wear out faster and you won`t have to cut them out.
35383,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 16:08:00,876,"now you'll be walking lob sidded,  it's hard to tuck a loonie in a g-string so u should carry crazy glue with you"
35390,Whopper,2007-02-16 16:25:00,2174,"They have tried this before with the Susan B Anthony dollar coin, didn't catch on then so I really don't know why this will work.  Then we had the two dollar bill that didn't work either.  Want kills me is most gas stations here won't accept a fifty dollar bill when it cost well over that to fill my truck up  Just my nickels worth"
35391,setomonkey,2007-02-16 16:31:00,872," Uh, that's a loon on our $1 coin . . .  Otherwise we'd be calling it a ""duckie"".    Mike"
35427,dustink,2007-02-16 19:31:00,526,"Don't think it will work either.....UNLESS....they get rid of the $1 paper note.  The only time a coin will work is when there is no paper option...as long as the paper is here, no coin is going to work.  I wish it would, I'm much rather have the coin....  dk"
35508,Rich Clemens,2007-02-16 22:34:00,3131,We'll get there .... I'm sure a couple of our presidents would fit that bill.   Loonie that is.
35584,Greencoachdog,2007-02-17 02:43:00,8163," They didn't retool for the Susan B. Anthony or Sacagawea gold dollar, and they won't retool for these either... these are novelty collectors coins just like the others."
35600,pikehunter,2007-02-17 03:24:00,1659," Everyone up here said exactly the same thing, but look at what happened. Who knows, with the retooling and everything associated with the dollar coin maybe the econony will get a good swift kick in the ass and it will be saved!  Come to think of it didn't many people say the same thing when we went metric???  The best thing about the Loonie was taking a pocketful of them down to the states and selling them to the Americans for dollar for dollar-even exchange! SO many people thought they were such a novelty and just had to get some!!"
35611,Greencoachdog,2007-02-17 04:10:00,8163,"They did try to retool with the Susan B., but it didn't work... they couldn't get the machines to accept them. The machines would end up stealing your dollar or not working with any coins, it was such a pain they didn't even try with the Sacagawea dollar... maybe they'll try it again. I don't see the dollar bill going anywhere any time soon."
