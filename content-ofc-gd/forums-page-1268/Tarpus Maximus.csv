35777,Clampet,2007-02-17 23:55:00,1947,"Well, added an extra 4 feet to the tarp wind shelter for a total of 12 feet long , by 6 feet high. This update also incorporates 3 extra support paint roller poles for a total of 6, from the original three used on the 6 x 8 foot long Tarpus Erectus.  I also switched to special ""One Wrap"" velcro fasteners from the re-usable plastic ""Tie Wraps"" that were breaking off in the sub zero (-12C) temperatures.  Some of the pictures were taken by the Missus, so they do not give a good rendition of the actual length of this new Tarpus Maximus.  All in all both the Missus and I were quite happy with the outcome, giving us much more room, and even extra room should we have a couple of visitors. The neighboring anglers advised that the Perch bite was off today, but I managed to scrape a few fer the table, so I did not go home empty handed, they are not big by any means, but they will not go to waste, as I have a deep appreciation for natures' bounty.  Started fishing 11:45 A.M. and left 3:00 P.M.  Tarpus Maximus 1st View   Another angle notice x-tra poles..   The Velcro connection..   My 1st Perch of the day, I was worried I wouldn't catch anything else so I thought  I'd better take a picture of this little gaffer..   The neighboring Perch crew..   The final tally.. "

35782,GbayGiant,2007-02-18 00:03:00,1780,"It looked like the Tarpus Erectile Dysfunctionist in the first attempt, it's getting better each time."
35811,DMASSE,2007-02-18 01:33:00,420,"HEY PAUL  NICE WIND BLOCK,  R U GOING TO THE FISHING FOR TYLER NEXT WEEKEND..  IF SO I WILL SEE  YOU THERE AND SHOW YOU MY SHELTER,  DAVE"

35830,GbayGiant,2007-02-18 02:44:00,1780,"HAHAAa, tell Elly May not to worry I will drill all the holes for her, ask her if I should bring the 6 or 8"" auger."
35834,Clampet,2007-02-18 02:52:00,1947,"Gawd I look awfull in that picture, somethin' akin to a snowblinded Billygoat."
35835,Clampet,2007-02-18 02:56:00,1947," Wall, I posed the question to Elly, and she asked if you could start with the 6 inch and then try the 8 inch (auger). "
35851,Beans,2007-02-18 03:24:00,3339,Very nice Jed...suprising how much warmer it can be once you are out of the wind...  I had days when I could stay out longer while others were packing it in because of the wind...and I never had a heater...  Can that last section become a side flap in case you get one of those days when the wind keeps changing ?  Looking forward to checking it out on the 24th.
35908,Clampet,2007-02-18 10:32:00,1947," Beans, I would go to an even longer tarp (16 foot) if I were to ""side flap"" a section. Wall Mart has the right price fer the tarp, and the extensible paint roller poles are 7$.95 ea. The velcro is about 4 dollars for a pack of 8, and worth it. I won't even consider sitting in a small hut ever again. People have no idea what it is like behind the tarp, but I bet with time you will start seeing more  of them.  I'm happy to be the resurgent pioneer of tarpism."
35987,Abberz,2007-02-18 15:26:00,140,I thought I caught some jumbo perch yesterday......I guess not!  Beauty haul you got there!
36000,Mike the Pike,2007-02-18 16:12:00,3421,Way to go Paul this time you really perfected the wind blocker I like how you reinforced her with snow.Have you considered a career in inventing or better yet you should think about getting in to the office cubacle business.LOL
36080,camillj,2007-02-18 21:33:00,1988,I would consider a little 'awning' if you decide to go with at least one 'side' ... by the way I stll say the V set up would do you better than the WALL setup ...did you try the V set up this time ?... keep at it ...
36130,ccmtcanada,2007-02-19 00:02:00,7971,Very nice setup there!!!  Each version gets better and better.  You'll have to sell your design...haha.  It's been great seeing the evolution of your wind shield....great stuff there!
36133,Rizzo,2007-02-19 00:14:00,4754,"nice shelter you got going there, practically a ""Four Seasons"" on ice.  Just need some slippers, a fuzzy robe and a paper delivered each morning."
