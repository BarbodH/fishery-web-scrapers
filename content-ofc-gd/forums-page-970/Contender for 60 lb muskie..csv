246176,bucktail,2008-09-03 13:34:00,1857,What did it weigh?
246178,BillM,2008-09-03 13:35:00,17367,I wish MuskyMike put his brute on a scale!!!
246181,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-03 13:40:00,0, You mean the one caught out by...........that place lol The one where DanZ caught a 40 on the other side. That fish? lol  How much did it weigh?
246208,Mr. Follow,2008-09-03 15:19:00,34,It doesn't need to be posted what it weighed if anyone must know they can PM me but what the web site says is pretty much accurate. Nad yes GB fisher it was caught in that place where DanZ got his 37 lber on the other side on the next day.
246210,kemper,2008-09-03 15:23:00,2232,"If that fish is 58, then I have to think the other one that was just posted is DEFINATELY fifty.  amazing fish, the only musky that I have ever caught that was even approaching 50 was a 45. And anyone who has ever searched for the elusive musky knows that there is a HUGE difference between 45  and 50, even though it doesnt sound like much"
246400,Marc Thorpe,2008-09-04 00:45:00,621,"the fish was caught last year at 58x25, it was around 49 pounds if anything the tail squeeze did not occur to get the extra inch,the extra inch is kept in the bank Like Darsky said,the due well deserved it,he's handed off more large ones than most can dream of  Lets just say when you see dozens upon dozens every year,you have some form of accuracy over time That girl is a legitimate contender if she bulls up more given the size for a summer fish girth in the water  Terry Nice 50 inch dollar bill,I""'ll see that Mark gets a copy Tks Terry"
246571,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-04 13:38:00,0,"Another monster Musky!!! Depending on what its gorging itself on, I think that musky can hit 60 lbs in the late fall!"
245984,Roy,2008-09-02 23:19:00,13728,"This fish was caught a coupla weeks ago, two I think, not too far from here. The fish is 58""x26"". She's a brute but she still only weighed probably not more than 52 lbs. If the man want's to come online to talk about it, that'll be fine. I just had permission to post it. It still is a nice fish.....they really are rare and so, 60 pounders are not something we could see very often if at all. If this one ate like a champ all through the fall, she'd still never hit 60 lbs but she'd be a contender.   There's only one other guy  who I know got a 58"" and that was Steve Bedarf a coupla years back...it was called the ""day of the giants"". They got a 57"" and a 58"" within 30 minutes of each other. Hope you enjoy the pic and thanks for reading.  "
245988,Greencoachdog,2008-09-02 23:27:00,8163,S'noice big fish!!!  Looks like you're puttin' on a few pounds there Bubba!
245991,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-02 23:31:00,3761,truly a amazing fish.
246020,Grimace,2008-09-03 00:04:00,2020,Man is that ever a nice fish.
246024,Sandbag,2008-09-03 00:06:00,533,"Man...when you look at the size of the anglers head and compare it to the fish, it is truly amazing how big that fish is.  Thanks for posting that Roy.  I hope he does come online and tell the story.  Cheers  Craig"
246028,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-03 00:10:00,0,....Its a gorrilla!!.....  Nice one there M.
246029,Terry,2008-09-03 00:11:00,14456,"nice fish it sure earned a 50+ buck        <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=50bucknicefish.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/50bucknicefish.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
246032,solopaddler,2008-09-03 00:13:00,8605,"Wow, another huge musky!"
246033,fishindevil,2008-09-03 00:13:00,6254,"Awesome,a true trophy !!!!...  fish of a lifetime for sure....cheers"
246036,Roy,2008-09-03 00:15:00,13728,Good one Terry!  How about a $58. bill! hahahahaha
246039,tbayboy,2008-09-03 00:18:00,1497,"What the heck is with all the giant musky pics lately?  That is a real beauty, congrats to your buddy!"
246066,mepps,2008-09-03 01:10:00,1301,Thats the fish that dreams are made of right there...amazing!
246069,Leecher,2008-09-03 01:13:00,7832,That brute is a real beaut
246080,darsky,2008-09-03 01:44:00,586,from what I heard he was well deserved of this fish. A very considerate fishing partner-great for him and the guy who put him on her.
246086,Joey,2008-09-03 01:46:00,9122,"Wow, what a monster   .  How come you never take us to that ""spot"" when we come vist hon???  Joey"
246087,Jigger,2008-09-03 01:47:00,1237,"I wonder if the low water temps this year have anything to do with all these big 'skis showing up? You know, feeding a little more regularily on prime spots? Thats one heck of a fish, for sure!"
246092,Wild,2008-09-03 01:51:00,704,Yeah what's with all the huge muskies... is this going to be a trend here? Any bets on the age of this monster?
246130,tonka-toy,2008-09-03 04:08:00,139,oh yeah!!! oh hell yeah!!!
246140,mistyriver1,2008-09-03 09:53:00,600,That's a beauty Roy for sure.  Nice markings and clean fish.  Thanks for posting it.
246147,BillM,2008-09-03 11:25:00,17367,Holy crap!!!! Did Mr.Thorpe put him onto that fish?
246148,ccmtcanada,2008-09-03 11:27:00,7971,Man oh man....the stuff of dreams!!!  Amazing fish!
246171,Mr. Follow,2008-09-03 13:10:00,34,I know I'm going to get blasted for this and that truly is an amazing fish But it's no way a 60 lb fish 50 lbs sure But I think that Muskiemikes fish was heavier and if that is a 60 lb fish then board member GB's fish from 2003 is a 70 lber and I know exactly what his fish weight.  Don't get me wrong that is an amazing fish and a fish of a life time but let's not inflate it let's just enjoy it.
246172,Roy,2008-09-03 13:18:00,13728,"Mr. Follow, there's no reason for anyone to ""blast"" you. You might want to re-read my original post though."
246173,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-03 13:20:00,0,I think thats Roys point here...that a 60 lber would be hard to come by.................................and are ya sure about GB's fish wieght?
246174,Mr. Follow,2008-09-03 13:26:00,34,Hey Roy I did miss that first line where you said it was probably not more then 52 lbs sorry about that.  GBfisher I do know what GB's fish weighed considering I was the one that netted it and weighted it when he caught it.
