245675,tibbs,2008-09-02 00:59:00,650,"Hello Everybody!  Just got back from Vancouver this Saturday after 3 weeks.  I had a blast and caught some big massive fish!  Week 1:  The first week me and my brother went up early to help my uncle with a few things around the house.  Here are some shots from the plane.       Week 2:  The next week my parents came up and we left for Tofino.  Here's some pics from Vancouver Island.          About half way to Tofino we stopped at an old growth forest.                 Then a little bit further we stopped at this river.                  Then we finally got to Tofino and are first stop was Long Beach.    The next day was the day we went salmon fishing. It did not go so well.  The night before there was a massive storm it was almost a hurricane.  So we got to the boat launch and our vessel for the day was a 28 ft Boston Whaler.  Once we left the dock it was a pretty smooth ride and i thought ""This ain't so bad"" but it didn't last very long.  Then came the massive swells.  I lasted for about 20 mins longer but then i got sick.  So our guide decided to try to troll here and instantly there was a double header and it was two cohos.  Then the bang there was a second double header and it was 2 Chinooks.  But after that there was nothing.  So my dad and uncle decide to pack it in.  By that time i was puking my guts out.  In the end we kept 3 of the 4 salmon.  But once i got back to our cottage i was still sick so i layed in bed the rest of the day.  The next day we went to all sorts of beaches and it was finally a nice day!  Here's my Brother and baby cousin throwing rocks at the beach at our cottage    Week 3:  We did a few more thing like going shopping in the states, Kayaking at Deep Cove and went to Downtown Vancouver.  But the highlight of the trip was Sturgeon fishing on the mighty Fraser!  First fish of the day was my mom's.                  Then it was my turn.          We didn't get any photos with it because the guide didn't realize how big it was.  Then my brother's turn.        Then i got this little guy.    Then this was the last fish for the day.     Hope you enjoyed this report and had great summers yourselves.  Now i have to go back to school tomorrow."
245680,MJL,2008-09-02 01:15:00,2427,Kick @ss report Tibbs  Sturgeon fishing is one thing I'd love to do in the future.  Looks like all of you had a blast on the trip.  Dying to get out there myself.  Thanks for sharing.
245682,Wild,2008-09-02 01:19:00,704,Sweet trip Tibbs love the bend in those rods!
245683,ccmtcanada,2008-09-02 01:20:00,7971,Wow...what a fantastic report!!!! You just lived my dream of heading out there and fishing for sturgeon.  Great pics....looked like a trip of lifetime.  Thanks for posting this report!
245687,Leecher,2008-09-02 01:25:00,7832,"Great report and pics tibbs  Man that was the species of fish I was waiting to see in a report.  Fraser river sturgeon's, in my mind, are the biggest fresh water fish.  Looks like your mom was having the fight of her life with that monster.....just trying to hold on to the rod with a slight bend backwards.....what a rush  Which one of the five was the biggest??  Do you have measurements for them?? Was this your first time catching sturgeons??  Sorry for so many questions but I truly enjoy and gets me fascinated when I see big strugeon like that.  Truly a trip of a lifetime! Again great job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
245697,tibbs,2008-09-02 01:38:00,650,"Hi Leechman,  This was my second time out but this time we caught way bigger fish. The guide said the second was the biggest (mine) but he didn't realize at the the time so we didn't get to shore.  My mom's: 6'6""  Mine: approx 7'  Brother's : 6'8""  All these fish were 150 - 200lbs  The others we didn't bother measuring."
245699,Joey,2008-09-02 01:43:00,9122,Superb report Tibbs.  Thanks for sharing that.  Wonderful pictures.  Those trees are huge.  Joey
245701,bigugli,2008-09-02 01:45:00,6138,Loved the fish. Loved the pics and story   Thank you for sharing your adventure. Definately one of those trips of a lifetime.
245708,Leecher,2008-09-02 01:58:00,7832," WOW....Thanks tibbs for the info.  It's really fascinating that those fish can live long life and get to the size that you guys caught.  The biggest sturgeon that I caught on the Ottawa river was a 49""er while ice fishing......I was so excited and can just imagine the adrenaline rush you guys got out that outing.  I'm sorry if I did not comment on the other pictures but this just got my total attention. Again great job Leechman"
245716,Rattletrap2,2008-09-02 02:21:00,1652,Great report tibbs! BC is a magnificent place! I was awestruck by the beauty we saw..
245755,sharper,2008-09-02 03:50:00,279,Sounds like you had a blast! Sturgeon fishing is something I plan to do when I go to B.C.
245761,GBW,2008-09-02 04:12:00,8460,"you are one luck person tibbs, great report and pic's!"
245767,Stern Rules,2008-09-02 06:06:00,342,Nice pics!
245774,Rich Clemens,2008-09-02 10:18:00,3131,Great report Tibbs ... great report.   Someday I'd like to give Sturgean fishing a try ... seems to be quite the battle.
245775,Roy,2008-09-02 10:31:00,13728,"Superb report, Tibbs. Some really great shots in there. Thanks for taking the time to post that for us.  You have yourself a great school year. I guess I don't need to tell you that the more successful school years you have, the more likely you are to be able to take trips like that whenever you want."
245783,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-02 11:27:00,0,"Very nice!How long was the fight to land the Sturgeon? That sucks about the bad weather. The guide should have known better! I would have asked for my money back! Same thing happened to me in Florida and although I did not ask, MOST did! Anyways, thanks for sharing."
245786,darsky,2008-09-02 11:33:00,586,great report. Good point Roy!
245876,tibbs,2008-09-02 17:01:00,650,  The fight was about 30 mins for the 3 big ones.  I wish we could of gotten our money back since it was $900 for 15 mins trolling.  But it said in the pamphlet only bad weather would be the only reason you would get your money back not sea sickness.  Oh well the sturgeon made up for it!
245916,splashhopper,2008-09-02 19:31:00,2931,"ummm.. your mom outfished by a ""ton""..  Nice trip pics...  thanks for an inspiring report tibbs"
