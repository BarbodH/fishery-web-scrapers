245911,kemper,2008-09-02 19:14:00,2232,"Hey all, as posted before I am livin is rez at the University of Guelph and the area is totally new to me. Went for a walk today and found a dam on the speed river that looks like it could hold some decent smallies, noticed a lot of small bass swimmin around just wonderin if anyone has even seen something worth writing home about come out.  Note, I will be doing the legwork and putting time in there regardless, just thought Id ask  thanks"
245913,bigugli,2008-09-02 19:18:00,6138,There is a long section of public park along the river. There are smallies and there are pike. Go north out of town to Guelph Lake for greater variety at the CA
246370,steelhead hunter,2008-09-03 23:17:00,152,yes there are a lot of smallies around the dam there are also some good pike above the dam
246396,Mike Pike,2008-09-04 00:39:00,1332,"Although I never get as far upstream as Guelph, I can tell you there's good Smallie fishing on the Speed around the Cambridge area.  Lots of Carp and some Pike in the system as well, plus lots of panfish.  You'll probably have a blast exploring 'cuz it sounds like a lot of the river is accessible up your way.  I'd just remember to bring a bit of everything with you.  My wading vest is pretty packed with a few spinners, tubes, Rapalas and floats.  It really amazes me how many times I can be working a hole with no results and once I change presentations, bang!  Goodluck with the fishing and with school, Kemp."
246403,chickenhawk,2008-09-04 00:52:00,612,i believe it gets a steelhead run......correct me if im wrong anyone but i think it gets one....
246440,Musky or Specks,2008-09-04 01:42:00,2710,No they dont get that far up the Grand. Some might get through the Paris Dam as it has a hole in it but the only river in the area that gets some steel is the Nith. Nice smallie fishing in the Speed. Hanlon Creek upstream of HWY 6 along Kortwright RD has Brookies.
246502,jediangler,2008-09-04 04:23:00,1923,More and better fish in Guelph lake with lots of shore fishing access.
