These smallies were caught during my first trip to Lake Erie (on the last calm day, August 7th). All of the fish that you see me with were caught on a wacky rigged Dinger PMP/CHART (I know, I'm a one trick pony). I did not have my scale at the time, but you can see that these are some healthy fish.    My nephew nabbed this beauty. "
