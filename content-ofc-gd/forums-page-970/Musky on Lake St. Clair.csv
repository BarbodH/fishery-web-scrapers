245511,jjcanoe,2008-09-01 18:42:00,744,"Went out on LSC with Slowpoke and my wife's uncle from Holland (not Michigan but the country) on Sunday morning.  After loading the gear in the boat and driving to the Hwy I realized I left my phone in my pickup @ home, or so I thought.... After a quick search of my truck turned up empty, we called my phone to listen for the ring and found it...... on the bow of Slowpokes boat.  Glad he's such a smooth driver! We ran through a bit of fog on the way from London to the launch, loaded up the boat and headed for the lake     Got some good tips from Mr.Eh who had already boated one by the time we got out to the lake and set up.  The first time a rod went we passed it to Theo, who does a lot of sea fishing back home in Holland, Ireland, and Norway, and is used to a bit bigger of a boat, Slowpoke lost his clip-on sunglasses on the landing in some of the confusion.  A 48""er was netted and released after a few quick photos      Next up was my turn on the rod   My PB musky was 40""   Finally the captain gets a turn   Nice one just shy of 40"" (It's a musky not a guitar!  )   Next up we lost one that snapped the 30lb powerpro mainline, would have liked to seen that one!  I ended the day with a 37""er   4 for 5 is a great day musky fishing.  Just about everything we put out got us fish 12"" jakes, woodies, bucktails etc.  We ran everything with no weight since we saw lots of fish up on the surface chasing food around.  Special thanks to Slowpoke for making the day happen   and to Mr.Eh who helped us out on location and baits    jjcanoe"

245526,Leecher,2008-09-01 18:59:00,7832,Great report and pics jjcanoe  Looks like a super day on the water amongst friends! and congrats on your PB Thanks for sharing Leechman
245539,Wild,2008-09-01 19:45:00,704,Fish to be proud of JJ And that ski head shot is simply wikkid!
245547,Raf,2008-09-01 19:51:00,3495,looks like a fantastic day and congratulations.  but..   30lb is for bass.
245553,jjcanoe,2008-09-01 20:03:00,744," 80lb flouro leaders + 30lb main sounded good to me we were on St. Clair not Lac seul!  I only use 15lb braid for bass and never had a prob in the heaviest slop.  Never musky fished before and I trusted what ""Captain"" Slowpoke gave us to use.   No regrets  jjcanoe"

245558,Joey,2008-09-01 20:16:00,9122,Beauty fish.  Thanks for the great report.  Congrats on the PB.  Water looks nice and calm.  Perfect day to be out there.  Joey
245596,glen,2008-09-01 22:02:00,2641,Nice looking fish.  Thanks for the report.
245600,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-01 22:12:00,0,Yet again another great Musky report from Lake St.Clair! Thanks for sharing.
245621,mepps,2008-09-01 23:04:00,1301,That looks like an awesome day on the water! Last time I fished with Brian all I caught was a cold!
245635,SlowPoke,2008-09-01 23:44:00,2984,"Had a great time out there and it's always a thrill to see someone get their first or personal best!  I have 50lb mainline on my muskie trolling rods but I had to equip 3 people. I had to use my salmon reels for 4 of the rods. When the rods fired for fish 1,2&3 I grabbed the rods, thumbed the spools, set the hook an set the drag. On fish 4, the breakoff, Theo grabbed the rod. He naturally reels left handed and had the rod in his right hand reaching over the reel to adjust the drag with his left and.... snap. It may have been tightened to quickly or, what Mike suggested, a ""death roll"". Sometimes when muskies hit, they can roll themselves up the 48"" leader into the mainline and 200lb braid wouldn't help if it was in their teeth. I've landed several 30+lb fish on 30lb PowerPro without any problem and in fact, I wish my 46""er today came on that reel instead of blowing up my 50lb linecounter!  -Brian"
245637,SlowPoke,2008-09-01 23:46:00,2984,Yeah but we saved that guy in the plane that was stranded on the island over the winter! LOL!!! -Brian
