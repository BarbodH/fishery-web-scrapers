246282,bassman,2008-09-03 19:36:00,384,"Hey gang,  I was thinking about taking a customer or two out for a musky charter in the next 1-2 months. We're all based out of the GTA and don't mind traveling a couple of hours to a good fishery.  Do you know of any good and reputable guides that can accommodate 3 anglers, and know a thing or two about musky?  I know there are a few guides on the board, feel free to respond, but I would prefer to hear from the customers.  Cheers"
246285,Raf,2008-09-03 19:45:00,3495,"""couple of hours""  of the GTA puts you on the Kawarthas or Georgian Bay.  Decide whether you want to catch fish or try to catch one big one.  Davis Battah runs a good service in the Kawarthas and Mr. Follow, a member here is involved with Graham B. who guides on the bay.  While I've never taken a charter, theirs or otherwise, both of these guys run reputable gigs.  I am sure you'll get other suggestions as well."
246287,Roy,2008-09-03 19:50:00,13728,You can also  check this list of guides and charters. Good luck to you.  http://www.muskiequest.com/directory/Guide...Canada/Ontario/
246288,bassman,2008-09-03 19:52:00,384,"Thanks, I was actually on Dave Battah's web site before you posted your response.  Must be a sign"
246296,mikeh,2008-09-03 20:19:00,824,"I was out on a charter with Davis Battah , he's a hard working great guy and we caught a few fish. Davis has a 20 foot boat with a stand up top which was really nice on the cool and windy fall day. Almost forgot to mention  that we fished Balsam."
246299,bassman,2008-09-03 20:25:00,384,"Thanks guys, I appreciate the quick responses. I did send a message to David.  Cheers!"
246317,Cast Adventures,2008-09-03 21:03:00,74,Give Frank a call at Niagara Sport Fishing. He's the best Muskie Guide in the Niagara region. http://www.niagarasportfishing.ca/  Take a look at some of the HOGS that his customers have landed!!!  Good luck!
246363,Pigeontroller,2008-09-03 23:04:00,2793,I 2nd rafs recomendation.
246388,bow slayer,2008-09-04 00:23:00,1074,If you want to cach lots of fish in the 40-48 inch range try Lake St.Clair. It has a huge musky population and several charters that cater to them.
246565,bigbuck,2008-09-04 13:21:00,2449,"Only problem with St.Clair is it's 3-4 hours from the GTA, it's not a day trip to musky fish there. At least with the Kawartha's, you'll have a good chance at a few musky and it's within 2 hours, less if you're in the East End."
246575,bassman,2008-09-04 13:43:00,384,"Thanks for the tips guys.  I'll probably be booking with Figure 8. I'll make sure to send a report.  I'd like to do LSC one day, but I absolutely can't stand the drive from TO to Windsor.  Cheers!"
246577,BillM,2008-09-04 13:46:00,17367,I've been recommended by a few very well known musky vets that Jody Mills out of Orangeville Ont is a good place to start..  http://www.millsmuskyguideservice.ca/
246578,jwl,2008-09-04 13:49:00,1056," Don't overlook Paul here from Cast Adventures either, he is a first class guy to spend the day on the water with, and a great multi-species guide who knows how to have a great time and put tonnes of fish in the boat.   Looking forward to seeing ya on the river this season for giant chrome Paul ,you will be seeing my boat alot"
246586,Toronto_Angler,2008-09-04 14:11:00,698,Hey guys I'm also looking for a charter in Kawarthas for me and 3 friends in October sometime. But we aren't just looking for a charter we are looking for someone who can share some knowledge and teach us the in's and outs of Muskie fishing.
246619,Mr. Follow,2008-09-04 15:49:00,34,Jody isn't out of orangeville he is out of lake Roseau Graham B is out of orangeville
246624,BillM,2008-09-04 15:52:00,17367,"Ahhh, I must have gotten Graham and him mixed up.  I've also heard great things about Graham to.. I think either would be a great bet for anyone who wants the chance to tie into a monster.  You started on with Graham not so long ago right?  Some of the pics on your site are incredible!"
246628,Handlebarz,2008-09-04 16:08:00,3790,check out Captain Rick Verbeem from Can-Am charter he is located in Belle River on Lake St.Clair and is a very good captain and boats alot of fish you will have a great time with him I send alot of people his way as I know he will treat you right and you have a great chance for multi fish day out.  http://www.can-amcharters.com/
246630,Mr. Follow,2008-09-04 16:09:00,34,Hi Bill I've known Graham For 32 years we went to school together. Yes I have started up with him this year but I've done a few guided days over the last few years for pike and pickerel in the spring as well a few for Graham. This year I bought a boat and decided to help him out parttime.
