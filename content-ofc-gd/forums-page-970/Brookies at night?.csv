246469,pokerdemon4,2008-09-04 02:34:00,135,Hello all.  Just wondering if any of you have successfully caught brookies through the ice at night and what baits are most productive?  Any tips or advice would be appreciated.  I have tried before but with little luck.  Anxious to hear any input.  Cheers.

Seems like they become more active in the daylight with overcast days being the best for me.  In my experience fishing for open water trout the bite kind of dies out as it gets fully dark.
