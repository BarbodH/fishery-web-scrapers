246401,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-04 00:46:00,1183,"  Thanks so much everyone...I will definitely go for 4 tires...not sure about the rims though...so much to choose from...at least I have some time to shop around locally (Ottawa area).  BillM....I'll probably be in touch with you.  And ChrisS, I will check out that shop in Morewood.  Again...thank you all....I'll let you know what I eventually end up with and how much $$$.  Nancy"
246460,salmon,2008-09-04 02:19:00,334,"I have done quite a bit of research when I was looking for winter tires for my Subaru and my wife's Mazda3 Try and get steel rims that were made specifically for you car. Do not get the multi fit rims that are sold at Can Tire, they are made to fit many cars. Better off going to the dealer and buying steel rims for your make and model (probably a good deal now). Also you would want to get hubcentric rims, the rims fit perfectly around the centerbore which is the size of the hole on the back of the rims. A hubcentric wheel has the center bore hole of the wheel exactly matching the vehicle's hub diameter. Multi fit rims rely mostly on the wheel studs only. Blizzacks for my AWD and I never lose traction. Nordic Ice trac for the wifes car.  http://forums.tdiclub.com  http://www.roadcompanion.ca/guide/_work/li...amp;magid=32627  Jose"
246483,GBW,2008-09-04 03:01:00,8460," Subaru too?    I have had these on more then my Subaru and they have been the best so far.   Still worth it when you look at how well they hold up and how well the preform.   Best time to buy OEM wheels is 60 to 75% way through the season.  You can toss snow's on your current wheels when the time comes (like others mention not to soon as they flake away) have them pulled and put on the OEM steel wheels you buy later on.  Do the change over at the same dealer in the spring as they will not charge much more if anything. As for when to put snow's on, I have been told by many diff. tire folks that 7*C and colder is the best time to have them on as there is less wear and tear on them.  Anything over 7*C on a reg. basis will wear them down to the point that you will get only 2 GOOD seasons out of them for anyone that dirves any distance. BTW, with the KM I do a year (610KM today just for one 2 hour meeting) I will be getting new snows this year for my Subaru () and also getting new wheels for them later on for the summer swap.  I'll gladly store those 4 steel (OEM) wheels in the garage for a bit at a huge discount...  Geoff"
246501,jediangler,2008-09-04 04:11:00,1923,"Opinions are like a part of the human anatomy, everyone's got one. Here's mine: I worked for 10yrs at Uniroyal, which became Uniroyal/Goodrich, which became Michelin. The quality standards on CTC tires were higher than that of any other brands we produced, including our own. We made Atlas, Irving, Fisk, Big ""O"", Sears, and on and on including Canadian tire. Say what you want, but you get a tire as good, or better, for half the price in some cases. My only suggestion would be to take them to your own mechanic to have them installed. I wouldn't let those guys monkey with my car."
246534,Fisherman,2008-09-04 11:26:00,7201,"I know it's a game of words but I really don't think that Uniroyal ""became"" U/G and then Michelin, I would rather say Michelin ""absorbed"" the other two crows. Unfortunate at best, but I still wouldn't put another Uniroyal on my wheelbarrow."
246537,BillM,2008-09-04 11:34:00,17367,"Nancy: If you search the classifieds on forums.tdiclub.com, or make a post in the regional forums, you'll find some OEM steel rims for cheap. My userid on that forum is LNXGUY, so if you join up drop me a PM and I'll see if I can find you a deal!  It's also a great resource for TDI owners."
246548,jediangler,2008-09-04 12:19:00,1923,"All I know, Fisherman, was the names on my paycheck changed from Uniroyal to U/G and when M.A.S.T. bought us (Michelin America small tire) they closed down both Kitchener plants to eliminate their competition. The North plant (formerly Uniroyal) and the South plant (formerly Goodrich). Michelin put over 2000 local workers out on the street, after recieving some very generous tax breaks and incentives from our local and provincial governments. They closed the Uniroyal plant first and then held the Goodrich plant for ransome. They told the government that if they didn't recieve some cash and tax breaks they would close the second plant. After getting what they wanted, they still closed the Goodrich plant. You can put Michelins on your wheelbarrow if you like but I won't be giving that company any of my money."
246584,Raf,2008-09-04 14:09:00,3495," No, the competition; Mitsubishi (2x Turbo AWD Eclipse/Talon, 1x Turbo AWD Galant - grocery getter from hell).  None of them stayed in stock form very long.  I heart turbos.  Regarding hubcentric and all that, if you don't buy hubcentric wheels, there are adapter plates/rings that will properly align these multi-fit wheels for you.  Any half-decent shop should be aware of these and tell you whether or not you need them.  There's a huge aftermarket wheel market afterall.."
246224,Canuck2fan,2008-09-03 16:07:00,1444," I can believe that friends of mine who work in the industry say the same thing.... However, if someone can save themselves 3 to 4 hundred bucks on a set of tires and rims by going to the U.S. they owe it to themselves to do so!!!! One reason the cheaper prices aren't available in Canada is that we accept that they aren't!!!!  I got a laugh when one tire dealer here wouldn't sell a friend a set of tires for the same price as he could get in the U.S. the dealer said that the cost was higher to him than the U.S. was charging. My bud said that is OK I am going to get them in the U.S. and you will have to look after the warranty.... The dealer claimed he WOULD NOT do that. The manufacturer ""explained"" to the dealer that yes he would fix any warranty problems and like doing it too, or they would pull their tires from his shop. Talk about playing both ends against the middle LOL...."
246238,maybe,2008-09-03 16:47:00,307,"The replacement GW3 model comes in your size, Nancy.  If they perform anything like the previous version, you'll be thrilled.  My street has a really nasty hill at the end.  It's a block and a half of 45 degree incline, and has (here's brilliance!) a 4-way stop right at the base of it.  It's long, it's steep, and you get absolutely no run at this thing.  To add to the fun, it's a quiet little street - sanders & snowplows don't pay much attention.  Running the previous GW2 version, my Saturn's walked up that hill in deep powder, wet packy stuff, and freezing rain.  Never a problem, never had to back down and try again.  More than I can say for some of my 4x4-driving neighbours.  Unless you're going to jack the car up and swap tires yourself, a 2nd set of rims isn't worth it.  Tires should be balanced when they're installed, so the car should be heading for a garage anyway.  You're already paying the tech to take the wheel off the car, balance the wheel, and put the wheel back on the car - the price for swapping the rubber is a negligible addition when you're mucking around in there anyway.  May as well pay the shop a few extra bucks twice a year, rather than $$$ up front and then have to tip your chiropractor."
246247,Lisa Gibson,2008-09-03 17:22:00,1,"Hi Nancy,  I work at Canadian Tire and have sent your note to our tire buyer for his thoughts/advice so will let you know what he suggests and what the feedback from customers has been on specific tires.  Lisa"

246270,BillM,2008-09-03 18:50:00,17367, I thought everyone over there was just addicted to diesels   Should I put a pic of my car in my sig here to?  lol
246272,johnnyb,2008-09-03 18:56:00,3413,"I personally LOVE Michelin X-Ice tires in the winter...had them on a similar sized vehicle and they're amazing!  Other people swear by the Blizzak's, and I don't think you  can go wrong either way.  My dad made the mistake of getting the Canadian Tire ones, 'cause ""they looked the same!"".  When the temperature dropped, they firmed right up and were pretty useless for him. My vote for the Jetta: X-ice! I put four 205-55-16's on for $700 taxes in, no rims.  I don't THINK the tires on your Jetta are as low profile as that, so you might be able to do a bit cheaper.  Good luck"
246275,Bernie,2008-09-03 19:19:00,3190,Whatever snow tire you end up getting Nancy make sure you put 4 on. Lots of people have made the mistake of 2 only and ended up in the bush. Snow tires give you an amazing amount of traction in comparison to all-seasons. Your vehicle has most of its weight on the front tires which gives you  more traction up there normally. If you dont have snows on the back there can be a tendency to lose traction in a turn or hard braking. But it's harder to feel it going to happen because the front feels so good with the snows. No one has mentioned the Kumho KW19. They work very well and are generally quite a bit less money. I use Wintermarks on my F150 and have been more than pleased with them. Sometimes you do pay more for the name. Blizzacks I find wear too quickly but they do work very well the first Winter (this will depend on how much you drive). Personally I find most Michelins too soft on the sidewalls but that's most likely because I like crisp steering.
246335,ch312,2008-09-03 21:43:00,1590,"the nordic track (think thats it) from canadian tire thats on sale 25% right now are very good tires.  just remember 3 things...  1)only use snow tires in the winter as they will wear down super fast in the summer 2)the ""tire guys"" say that even the cheapest snow tire will provide more traction than premium all season tires 3)you must get 4 tires. 2 snow tires on one end and 2 all seasons on the other = accident waiting to happen"
