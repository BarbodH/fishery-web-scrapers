Mixed success through the summer months but did end up with some walleye for supper on occasion. My wife Karen and son Alex and I went out before it got scorchingly hot yesterday morning. Bagged 2 pickerel on the first two casts and said yahoo I'm on it today. Spoke too soon as usual, no more for me. Karen picked up one more pickerel before we left. She also caught a sheephead and me a sunfish to toss back. A friend in a boat nearby caught a dandy smallmouth but didn't take a picture. I would guess about a 20 to 23 "". We fished a little over an hour before it got too hot. May give a go this coming weekend as it's supposed to cool off some.    "
