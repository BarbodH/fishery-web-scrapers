245710,glen,2008-09-02 02:02:00,2641,Thanks for the pic.  It looks interesting.  Looks like a two or three piece boat.
245714,Cast-Away,2008-09-02 02:18:00,790,"I can only assume from the age of the trailer that the boat itself was quite old? Do you know how old it was?  Hydrostreams take a real pounding riding on the chine all of the time. It looks to me like a stress crack from age. Given where it is, the boat is likely dumpster material now. What a bummer."
