I have enclosed a picture of him   If anyone sees this puppy please put the correct postage on his collar and send him to me.  Yes their is a big reward it is $ 10.00 more than Spiel offers you to not send him to me...  Thanks for the update photo Chris I have sent it to the other members of the ""I love Brook fan club"" down here.   Art"

245724,ccmtcanada,2008-09-02 02:27:00,7971," Spiel told us that he has some new boat moves, so you're likely in better hands with Art.  LOL.  Good luck Art...funny....I've seen that dog before....hmmmm....."
