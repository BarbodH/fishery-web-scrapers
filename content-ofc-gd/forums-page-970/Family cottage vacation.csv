245578,jjcanoe,2008-09-01 21:08:00,744,"Well the annual family ""stress relief/not @ work"" vaction happened last week and it was a great one. Up north of Kingston is the place I've been going to since I was a kid and now I bring my own.  In addition to our family we had my wife's uncle from Holland and some friends with thier daughter come along as well.  The weather was unbelivable all week with only a light mist/drizzle on Friday breaking up all the sun we had for the rest of the week.  Where do I get my boaters card??   To start the week off right I boated a 2lb 4oz largie within the first 10 minutes of fishing   and then a decent pike for that lake   Evening was the time to hit the pads with the frogs for pike and largemouth    Dave hasen't fished in years but here he is with his first ever bass and pike.    Charlotte's first fish!   Little John with a nice pike on a spinner bait in the weeds   and a largemouth on a frog   and his big smallie out of the rocks   Big fish of the week was    Dave's big smallie   Double header!   Some call them casualties of war but I call them HEROS! (trailer hooks don't work so well in the slop we were pitching into)   jjcanoe"
