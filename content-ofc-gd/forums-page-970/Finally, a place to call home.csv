Took over a month to negotiate the deal, the owner got transfered out the country and had to sell. Anyways, we got a hell of a deal and are currently fixing things that need to be addressed, like building a deck etc...  Anyways, for those of you that helped me in my quest for a little piece of heaven, thanks.  Now we have to buy a boat.....hopefully see some of you on the water, if not this year, next year for sure...  cheers Sully"

Although we've only spent 1 week there. its actually a nice park, people seem friendly. have to buy a boat to fully enjoy where we are though.  We have 1 more month before we have to close it up... we'll try to cram as much fun in as possible.  Tangled and JWL, thanks for the encouragement.....it'll be fun."
