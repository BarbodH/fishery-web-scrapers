245784,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-09-02 11:28:00,1362,Very nice Bass Terry....  .....who does your ironing?...the crease on your sleeve is outstanding
245785,Daplumma,2008-09-02 11:32:00,1961,Nice fish...looks like it would have gone for 6 lbs if it had a tail.
245800,Headhunter,2008-09-02 12:44:00,5703,"Nice, really nice smallie guys! When I read the post title, I would have bet that it was a big silver thing that goes Bahh, bah! LOL HH"
246045,Cudz,2008-09-03 00:26:00,2652,You might be right.  I am going to give it another shot tomorrow evening to see if I can scare up a few more.
246047,danc,2008-09-03 00:31:00,4677,Great fish Terry. Where did you buy that shirt?? I gotta get me one just like it.
245445,misfish,2008-09-01 17:08:00,29133,Thought I would start the suspense now. What a real nice fish.  It will be worth the wait.
245446,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-01 17:09:00,3761,What kind of fish was it???
245449,misfish,2008-09-01 17:18:00,29133, It was caught on  a spinnerbait.
245451,Greencoachdog,2008-09-01 17:23:00,8163,I dunno.... with Terry being the Photoshop King... his credibility is somewhat limited!   ... but I believe you Brian.
245454,steverowbotham,2008-09-01 17:26:00,1800, ill bet i know
245460,Terry,2008-09-01 17:34:00,14456,"well it doesn't look that big in the picture  maybe I do need to touch it up a little bit   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3322.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3322.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   but it did put up a great fight  they didn't seem to be schooling just one here and one there I think all but one was caught on spinnerbait another great day on the water  Thanks for the company Misfish lets do it again soon"
245470,bassjnkie,2008-09-01 17:50:00,1101,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
245471,misfish,2008-09-01 17:51:00,29133,"Your right bud,your holding it all wrong.LOL They sure were on the spinner baits today.Nothing like watching them smack that bait. I could not believe it took me that long to get a tube bite.HAHA Whats with the water too? Man it was so cloudy and we have had nothing but calm waters for a week. That fish will be two pounds heavier come October."
245474,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-01 17:54:00,957,Beauty of a fish.  Nice going Terry.
245475,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-01 17:56:00,3761,was it weighed?
245480,misfish,2008-09-01 18:02:00,29133,"No,but I would have to say,just tilting the 6 pound mark."

245721,Jigger,2008-09-02 02:25:00,1237,"That fish is huge! Congrats, That must have been a rush!"
245728,Cudz,2008-09-02 02:29:00,2652,hmmm.  Did you guys hit up my spot this morn?  lol!  I hope so.  That fish actually looks much darker than those from my spot so it might not be.  Congrats!!  Nice hawg!
