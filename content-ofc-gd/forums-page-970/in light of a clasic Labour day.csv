245664,Joey,2008-09-02 00:47:00,9122,"Now that's funny.  If you'll notice, the guy in the middle of this pic with the blue and white hat on is my dad.  This hat had ARGO's across the front and a white pom pom on the top and he wore it everywhere.  This is some time in the 70's and I can tell you, it was pretty embarrassing being about 12 and your father wearing that hat around saying ARGGOOOOOOSSSSS.  Thanks for bring that fresh hell back into my life    Joey"

245821,Mike Pike,2008-09-02 13:29:00,1332,"I was at the game yesterday and the prior tale gate.  A great time and a great game, which didn't do too well for us Ti-Cat fans.  It was a close one and almost won 3 straight agains the Argos.  Ya, the Cats are having another terrible season, but the Blue and White are really not too much better.  Montreal wins the division by default."
245914,modny,2008-09-02 19:20:00,502,"i was sitting in section 8, and i tell ya..  after the game was complete mayhem. a HGUE brawl started between a bunch of goof balls.  one dude got speared and taken down 3 or 4 aisles.  i love hamilton."
