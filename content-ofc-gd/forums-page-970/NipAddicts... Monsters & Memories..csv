245186,Billy - Curtiss,2008-08-31 20:29:00,241,"Awesome report dude. I'm totally jealous. After reading Dan's last Nipigon report, I've been conversing with some Sudbury bros about the possibility of a week up there at ice out in the spring. You mentioned poachers and I was checking the regulations for Nipigon particulars but for some reason couldn't find any. Are you not allowed to keep any specks?"
245206,solopaddler,2008-08-31 21:56:00,8605,"Wow Drew what a report! You've had quite the summer dude, can't wait to read about your NWT trip  ."
245251,addict,2008-09-01 01:35:00,475,awsome trip sweet pics.
245312,Chris,2008-09-01 11:23:00,405,I read this report on Fishhawk yesterday. Have you ever thought about compiling all of your fishing reports in a book and making it available to the public? You really should.  
245368,rob v,2008-09-01 14:35:00,535,This is one of the reasons I enjoy this site - thanks for sharing your story.  Well written. Rob V
245745,Moosebunk,2008-09-02 03:16:00,3970," 1 speck over 22 inches.  The lake has a bunch of Regs not like other places.  It's a testament to the fisheries preservation.  The doods we thought were poaching chucked a couple fish into a cooler that I didn't think were 22.  We could see them pretty well.  Thanks for the replies folks.  Ron, it would have been cool to meet ya had you made it this year.  Same could have been said for Spiel.  Maybe down the road."
245830,dannyboy,2008-09-02 14:15:00,367,"Great report, well done.  Dan"
245833,Roy,2008-09-02 14:47:00,13728,"Y'know Andrew, I always read your reports several times just because they're well written, informative, humourous etc...etc... I've come to a point where saying things like 'awesome', 'great', 'congratulations'  just doesn't cut it anymore. I just want you to know that I look forward to and read everyone of your threads and they never disappoint.  So, for what it's worth, congratulations. That was a great, nay, an awesome report."
245837,jwl,2008-09-02 15:05:00,1056,"another stellar report loaded with pics...wouldn't expect anything less, your reports make it about as close as you can get to being on the trip with ya without leaving the house  man I wish I got to have half the great adventures you do, you are a lucky man to have such a great family too that makes it a million times easier to enjoy all your great trips"

245007,FinS,2008-08-31 00:02:00,463,that is some absolutely amazing fish porn along with the report only in my dreams thanks for taking the time to share congrats

245013,Wild,2008-08-31 00:51:00,704,Epic trip of the year guys!
245025,Ron,2008-08-31 01:20:00,1683,"Just an awe inspiring report MB!  You have also meet some of the nicest guys on this trip as well. The best part of this whole report is knowing exactly where each and every fish you caught was. I have only fished Nipigon less than a dozen times but the background still shows off well. I am rather suprised you don't have a photo of a brookie being caught from under the hanging Black Spruce though, not too from your camp. That boulder you mention of, I know it well too, in fact DanC was in the boat with us that night.  If I had to guess, I bet that beauty Laker was caught from the Triangle shoals.  Thanks for letting us live through your recollectoins.  Cheers, Ron..."
245027,canadian_copper,2008-08-31 01:23:00,925,steller report
245032,danc,2008-08-31 01:34:00,4677,"Well, I can't say that I'm surprised at all about the fishing, because this is my back yard. But it was a pleasure to read a report from another's perspective. It was truly an honor to meet a couple of fellow OFC'ers as well as Pat and Rich. But what really made my week was the fact that I made it into a Moosebunk report. It was indeed a pleasure to meet both you and Wayne. I have a feeling that we'll be sharing more boat time in the future. Sooner rather than later I hope."
245038,tbayboy,2008-08-31 01:51:00,1497,"Epic report.  I can't believe I grew up 2 hours from there!  Sounds like an amazing trip was had by all.  ""anglinate the roof off the mutha"" <-- best fishing report line this year"
245040,scuro,2008-08-31 01:58:00,386,"That's gotta be one of the best reports so far. Stunning landscapes, loads of fish, different species, some real honkers....and lots of smiles. Good one on ya all: Drew, Dan, Rich, Pat, and Wayne. I gotta get to that lake....."
245055,Cookslav,2008-08-31 02:52:00,1457,"All I gots to say is.....WOW!  Thats a trip report!!!! Glad to see you boys hit the Speck so well, and some very, very impressive Catches I might add. The Nips has always been on my list of lakes to fish...thanks to this report I think I may just have to buy the warden something nice, and get to the begging"
