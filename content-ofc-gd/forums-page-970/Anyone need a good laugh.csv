Her birthday was coming up and she thought this was a good time to tell her mother what she wanted. 'Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.'  Now, Little Carol was a bit of a troublemaker.. She had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Carol's mother asked her if she thought she deserved to get a bike for her birthday. Little Carol, of course,  thought she did.  Carol's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted her to reflect on her behavior over the last year, and write a letter to God and tell him  why she deserved a bike for her birthday. Little Carol stomped up the steps to her room and sat down to write God a letter.    LETTER 1:  Dear God:  I have been a very good girl this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.  Your friend,  Carol    Carol knew this wasn't true. She had not been a very good girl this year, so she tore up the letter and started over.    LETTER 2:  Dear God:  This is your friend Carol. I have been a pretty good girl this year,  and I  would like a red bike for my birthday.  Thank you,  Carol    Carol knew this wasn't true either. She tore up the letter and started again.    LETTER 3:  Dear God:  I know I haven't been a good girl this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good girl if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.  Thank you,  Carol    Carol knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get her a bike. By now, she was very upset. She went downstairs and told her  mother she wanted to go to church. Carol's mother thought her plan had worked because Carol looked very sad.  'Just be home in time for dinner,' her mother said.  Carol walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. She looked around to see if anyone was there. She picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary, slipped it under her jacket and ran out of the church, down the street, into her house, and up to her room. She shut the door and sat down and wrote her letter to God.    LETTER 4:  I GOT YOUR MAMA.  IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.  Signed,  YOU KNOW WHO"
