243882,TJQ,2008-08-27 16:27:00,7806,"Up to camp one last time before the summer ends and back to school / work routine starts again...  Managed to get through another year with Monique... lol 19 years now I don't know how I put up with her.  Also gto my Dad and Aunt Claire in for the night for the first time.  Took them out fishing for the afternoon and my Aunt cleaned up and showed us all how it was done.. what a fish fry we had!!!  This is the second big green caterpillar we see... must be a lunar moth or something    Avery and our first pickerel    Then I brought the real fishermen out!           My Dad had never done topwater before...  theres plenty off the dock,  he got a real kick outta catching a fish with no live bait.      Avery taking a few loonies form his great Aunt... little buggers getting pretty good at crib!                 A nice family fish fry.     Avery with a bass off the dock.       Aver built a lean too during the cold front that blew through.    After my dad left we spent the day exploring the water below the rapids. We did very well.             Monique even managed to get us our salad!!               Out Jimmy Jamming with the kids!       Redneck corkscrew.....     Back to work for a couple of days and then its up to temagami with the good ole boys for the long weekend!"
