246161,Roy,2008-09-03 12:25:00,13728,"I believe that yours is a 1969, Twister. Google ""Johnson outboard serial numbers"". It'll give you the info."
246163,ccmtcanada,2008-09-03 12:30:00,7971,Here's some info....  http://forums.iboats.com/showthread.php?t=80541  I concur with Roy at this point....any search for 6R-69M pulls up 1969 6hp Johnson.
246168,Mr Twister,2008-09-03 12:54:00,71,Thanks for your help guys as I know I could count on you!
246245,boatman,2008-09-03 17:08:00,350,Yes the motor is a 1969. Ratio is 50:1 with TC-W3 outboard oil and 87 octane gas.
