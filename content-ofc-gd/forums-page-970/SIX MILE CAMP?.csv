244410,bigugli,2008-08-29 02:51:00,6138,Are you referring to Six Mile Lake Provincial Park?
244446,Victor,2008-08-29 11:07:00,1609,"Welcome to the board Gogu,  Here on OFC we love to see introductions from new members, that'll let us get to know you alittle. People are less likely to reply if you just sign up and fire away with the questions. We also love pictures!  With that said, if you're referring to Six Mile Lake Provincial Park, a quick search on google tells me that there's Pike, Walleye, SM/LM bass and panfish there.  Good luck and let us know how you make out."

245924,gogu392,2008-09-02 19:46:00,142,"Sorry folks but time is a issue for me. I AM SORRY that I not introduce properly myself. But now I have some time and I will try to correct my mistake.  I am from Toronto/Scarborough. Newbie as a fisherman. No boat - no buget for now, maybe later. Start fishing around 2 years ago. I think that fishing is one of the best way of spending time (IF NOT THE BEST). I hooked in last 2 years: carp, pike, LM bass, SM bass and walleye. Best record: Pike - 3.5kg, Walleye: 4kg - I have the picture if interested.  Yes, I was asking about SIX MILE provincial park. I went there 31Aug - 1 Sept camping. Without a boat there is no fishing there.  Pros: close to the HW400 - easy access from locations far away Cons: too close to HW400 - at night time you can hear the crikets but also the truck on HW400  Regards & keep in touch."
245949,bigugli,2008-09-02 21:08:00,6138,"Without a boat, there is a lot of fish to catch from shore. Pike are in the bay all the time. Short drives from the park to Whites Falls, the Lift or Pt Severn provide excellent shore fishing opps."
246244,gogu392,2008-09-03 17:06:00,142,Thank you for the tip. This has sense. I see a dam and a bridge on Whites Falls Rd  See the link.  http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UT...mp;t=h&z=18  Is this a good spot?  Regards.
246279,napjohn8,2008-09-03 19:31:00,46,"hey i was at six mile lake for the bass opener in june. The best area to go fishing is the little back bay with lilly pads besides camp sites 51, 52 and 53. You can take your boat there and cast. It is full of deep weedlines with pike bass and the occasional walleye. I ended up catching 10 bass in half an hour during the full moon in june. Dont use spinnerbaits they get skunked in the weeds. THe best to use are topwater lures."
