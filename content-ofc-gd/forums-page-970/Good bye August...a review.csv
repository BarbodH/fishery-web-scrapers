245696,Garry2Rs,2008-09-02 01:36:00,1425,"August was another terrific month for fishing in my area. To save gas, all the lakes I fished were within a 10 miles radius of my house in the North Kawarthas. It rained a lot for the first three weeks of the month...thank goodness that's over...for now...hahaha. Here are a few of the pictures we took in August. Not all these fish are big ones, but they were all significant to the angler in some way... Like their first fish on a certain type of bait etc.                                           Today was September first, so let me tell you how this month started... I went prospecting and launched into a small lake were everyone knows there are tons of little SMBass but no ""Big Ones"" I just knew that those little ones had to have Mommies and Daddies somewhere...GRIN. The red head from next door caught a 2 pound 3 ounce SMBass on a 4 "" Carolina pumpkin Yum Dinger with a chartreuse tail.  The fish was in deep water between two shoals.  I caught a 19+ inch 3 pound 3 ounce SMBass on a 5"" Watermelon no-name Senko with a chartreuse tail. This fish was off the end of an island where the water dropped to 20+ feet.  It required a little patience to wait for the weightless worm to sink that deep, but the pay-off was...""Sweet!""  Garry2R's PS... I have a new website for my guide service. It's not quite 100% finished but you can check it out at http://www.muskystriker.com/let'sgofishing Let us know what you think... Thanks. 2R's"

245705,Rattletrap2,2008-09-02 01:51:00,1652,Looks great Garry! Those are some nice Bass.  Looks like Andy K has a hand in this somehow? Hope he is doing well also.  Good luck with the guide business.
246025,Garry2Rs,2008-09-03 00:08:00,1425,"Your right about AndyK. having a hand in creating the website. In ""Think and Grow Rich"" Napoleon Hill suggested that it isn't necessary for a person to know how to do everything he needs to do, if he surrounds himself with smart friends...grin."
