246209,Vanselena,2008-09-03 15:19:00,269,Fished Port Glasgow  Fished 190 out of port to 70fow. Fish are very abundant still. We landed 5 for the box in 2 hours and live released a bunch more.   If you use a Cuda Torpedo 155 feet of line out with a blue easter egg spoon 40' back you will have a difficult time keeping that rod down. Surface speed 3mph
