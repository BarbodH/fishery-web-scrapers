Most Albertans have never seen a bass, I think there are 1 or 2 lakes in the province that have smallmouth. Lots of pike & pickeral but trout is the big attraction.  BPS not much of a fly fishing shop."

I have gone in twice this year, looking for lures that are widely available in the US,  and widely written about in various mags. Both times I have been told by staff ""there is no such lure"". Thankfully, the place is layed out well enough to find things on my own."
