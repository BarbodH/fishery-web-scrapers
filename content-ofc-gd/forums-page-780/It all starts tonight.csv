389617,dave524,2009-10-03 10:43:00,4508,"The glimmer of hope I saw in the preseason was quickly laid to rest with the start of the regular season, same old, same old, same old."
389618,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-03 10:56:00,0,wow!  how defeatist can you get? the leafs owned that game...price just played real well! don't get too down on yourself yet leaf nation!
389624,solopaddler,2009-10-03 11:49:00,8605,"  That's the rub. Burke gambled big time with that trade and put a lot of pressure on the team to succeed now. Tough to watch as a Leafs fan if they lose...  The game itself was a good one, Price stole the extra point. Was at a high price for the Habs though. I really can't see them making the playoffs with Markov out 'till after the olympics."
389635,JohnF,2009-10-03 12:32:00,3494," Poor Michael is only $200,000,000 behind him.  JF"
389638,JohnF,2009-10-03 12:44:00,3494,"  Like I said - if they'd been able to trade goalies the score would have been more like 5-1 Leafs. But Toskala will have some good games, or he'll be riding the pines and the Monster will get a chance to prove he can sustain his preseason, albeit brief,even  promise. If neither can deliver Burke better go shopping again.  In the meantime it's fun to watch, way better than last year. And until our bubble gets burst, if in fact that happens, we've got nothing to lose but games. The real pressure is on the top teams to maintain their spot. Leafs got nowhere to go but up. Some other teams nowhere but down.  JF"
389147,misfish,2009-10-01 23:15:00,29133,GO LEAFS GO.
389148,Twocoda,2009-10-01 23:17:00,4130,breath it in and pass it along    i know you really meant GO FLAMES GO !!
389152,BUSTER,2009-10-01 23:27:00,1336,hockey sucks
389155,GBW,2009-10-01 23:32:00,8460,not even 2 min. in and a fight.  nice....
389160,danbouck,2009-10-01 23:45:00,4380, I wasn't impressed by that
389161,Daplumma,2009-10-01 23:46:00,1961,Caps have the Bruins tonite but I think we have the hapless Leafs this weekend. Joe
389162,GBW,2009-10-01 23:48:00,8460,"the fight wasn't a good fight, but that they are trying to show they are going to be a tuff team on the ice this year."
389165,GBW,2009-10-01 23:51:00,8460,another fight...
389171,grinandbearit30,2009-10-02 00:03:00,50,Go Sens Go!  But really I don't have high hopes for the Sens this year.
389172,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-02 00:18:00,0,watching the leafs and habs is like watching hitler fight yoko ono.  you just watch and hope they beat the crap out of each other!
389176,Roy,2009-10-02 00:21:00,13728, Very nice.
389177,misfish,2009-10-02 00:23:00,29133,Beat me to it Roy.  Good pace to the game.
389179,Rizzo,2009-10-02 00:23:00,4754,"man oh man they better not ""win"" the lottery this year (or next year), all I've got to say"
389180,GBW,2009-10-02 00:24:00,8460,don't you mean yoko ono and courtney love?    they both ______ the men in their own way...
389181,Weeds,2009-10-02 00:28:00,782,"Awesome! The leafs are going to kick so much rear this year that they are sure to Bring home the cup!! They are still awarding it to which ever team is the best at compiling penalty minutes and winning scraps, right? Waaa-hooooo!"
389184,Muskieman,2009-10-02 00:37:00,2472,Overpaid GOONS who chase a piece of tar/cow-patty down the ice .......?????????????????   Rather watch tennis or darts.  I was forced into hockey as a kid  made it to Bantam AAA  and WON the Silver Stick in Fort Erie back in 1986..... disliked Hockey ever since.  RFS 
389189,HTHM,2009-10-02 00:46:00,4082,Leafs lost my support after this Ballsile fiasco.
389192,JEREMY,2009-10-02 00:50:00,300,I am not saying they are going to win the cup or go deep into the playoffs.I am just glad hockey is back. GO BUDS GO
389201,Rizzo,2009-10-02 01:06:00,4754,"raptors will make the playoffs and lose in first round, leafs will not make the playoffs and will end up giving Boston the third over-all pick in next year's draft...book it"
389216,Rizzo,2009-10-02 02:09:00,4754,"eerily similar to last year - play hard but no finishing ability, lose lead late in game, then lose game in OT (or shoot-out)"
389222,acmarou,2009-10-02 02:29:00,63,"Hey Randy!!! Forced Eh! Maybe you were told that!!! You know what, you were never that good bud!!! Get over yourself!!!"
389354,jediangler,2009-10-02 15:31:00,1923,I can't wait to see the Bruins get two lottery picks the next two years for Kessel. Penalties are going to cost the Leafs big time this year.
389371,Lunker777,2009-10-02 16:16:00,866,"Overpaid ???????? These guys get the crap beat out of them night after night.... tonnes of retired hockey players have life long injuries or things of the sort in life after hockey !  But meanwhile... you have baseball players making $20,000,000 + a year to throw a ball and hit it... LITERALLY !!!!!! oh yea, they run too !!!! But thats not over paid!"
389593,JohnF,2009-10-03 03:26:00,3494, And Tiger just topped one BILLION dollars. And that's with no body contact at all.  JF
389598,Twocoda,2009-10-03 03:50:00,4130,i cant even find my truck keys ..let alone a golf ball....  ...Good for Tiger though ...he is the first to do it ...Even before Micheal Jordan
