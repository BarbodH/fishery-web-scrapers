389797,Dabluz,2009-10-04 04:30:00,701,"One thing for sure, lines change over time even though they sport the same name.  Ok....Vanish hasn't changed in over 10 years but I think the company is stuck with too much stock...lol.  Sure there were a number of independant tests done on braids, fluorocarbon and mono and I'm sure that there have been some changes over the years.  The sad part is that fishermen don't have the budgets and time to test many lines during a fishing season so they must trust what has been working good for them.  One mono has stood the test of time since it came out is the original Stren.  Yes, the company can say that there 8 lb test Stren is the strongest 8 lb test mono on the market but if you check it's diameter....it is larger than some 10 lb test monos....lol.  Since it is a very inexpensive line, it does have irregularities in diameter (therefore strength) throughout it's length.  It's size makes it more abrasion resistant than other lines and it does not stretch quite as much as Trilene XL.  UltraViolet exposition does weaken it quickly....especially the fluorescent colours but, all monos that have added fluorescence added to them to make them easier to see also attracts UV wavelengths.  The best way to see if your mono is being affected by UV and heat etc is to run a good length of the line between your thumb and forefinger and then look to see if there is a white powdery substance on your fingers.  This means that the line should have  been changed a good while ago....lol.  Pros change their lines every day because they have noticed that after a day's exposition to sunlight, heat, dust, stress etc....the line does get weaker.  Catch a really big fish that has stretched your mono, especially if it has been soaking in the water for a while, you will see that it has weakened.  I only use clear mono except for Trilene XT which is available in green only.  What I find strange is the fact that Berkley had an excellent line by the name of Sensithin.  Since I use only 2 to 6 lb mono on small spinning reels, I can immediately see if a line is weak, large diameter, visible in the water, hard to manage and Sensithin was the best I had used up till now.  Now, I'm in limbo....trying to find a line that is equivalent to Sensithin.  Yes, I do have a spool or 2 of 4 lb Sensithin in a drawer in the basement but after next spring, I will have no more.  One mono that has surprised me has been ordinary clear Silver Thread.  I have only used it in 6 lb test but it has been surprising.  The sad part is the fact that there isn't much choice in lines where I live.  I see rows and rows of Trilene, Power Pro, Stren but some of the premium lines that come from Europe or Japan are never available.  According to what I have read, the best or one of the best monos is Remington Ultra.  I would like to try that stuff some day.  As for fine lines with big fish, I have caught 20 to 40 lb sturgeon on 4 lb mono and my buddy caught a 12 lb pike on 4 lb mono that he put on his Pixy baitcaster.  He was jigging for walleye.  I often use 4 lb mono for walleye and often catch pike in the 4 to 6 lb range.  I fish a lot with baitcasters but have never tried putting mono on a baitcaster....does it add distance when casting?"
389898,Garry2Rs,2009-10-04 18:38:00,1425,"First of all Co-polymer isn't Fluorocarbon, it's mono with a Fluoro. coating...possibly the worst of both worlds...grin. Second, not all Fluorocarbon is the same.  the better brands even have different versions for reels and leaders. Third, Kevin Van Dam swears by (his sponsor) BPS' 100% Fluoro.  He is a better fisherman than me and I will defer to him. Fourth, any 15 pound plastic line Mono or Fluoro. will fish Cranks or Spinnerbaits okay on a casting reel. Fifth, I think 15 pound test plastic line is too heavy for a spinning reel.  My rule of thumb is that spinning reels are used for baits of 1/4 ounce or less...You don't need 15 pound test line with lures that small UNLESS it's Braid. Sixth, I use Braid most of the time, but heavy plastic lines work okay on casting reels for pitching, or for cranks, spinnerbaits, jerkbaits or Mono for surface baits etc. Seventh, fish IMO, don't ""see"" the line, no matter what you use, on fast moving baits like cranks and spinnerbaits. Eighth, Fluorocarbon sinks, so use it for divers, but not surface baits. Ninth, there is very little difference in the stretch of mono or fluoro. Tenth, some Fluoro is more abrasion resistant than Mono."
389517,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-03 00:29:00,3761,"Hey, bought some 15lb P-Line Fluoroclear fishing line today, going to be using it on my 6'6M casting combo and on my 7'MH spinning combo. Just spooled up the spinning rod and it seems to feel and be limp enough.  Just asking to see what some member have to say about P-Line. From what I hear there fluorocarbon line is top notch.  Just wanting feedback, MTBF"
389520,gone_fishin,2009-10-03 00:34:00,481,"i use the 4 lb for ice fishing, and i've used the 8 lb as well... never gone up to 15 though, so i can't help you there.  believe it or not, the walleye in my avatar was pulled up with the 4 lb line"
389522,bucktail,2009-10-03 00:34:00,1857,"Hey Mike......I have used that line before, I find it a little to stiff, but youll like the lack of stretch and feel. Remember most flouro isn't as impact resistant as mono so try not to cross their eyes too hard! I bought some line conditioner to try out on the spools of flouro I have, Ill tell you how I make out."
389523,Greencoachdog,2009-10-03 00:36:00,8163,"Sorry to hear that Mike, P line is short for piss on this line!!!... you shoulda bought Vanish!!!   ... let us all know when that line fails and the big one breaks your heart (and line) and get's away!!!"
389524,gone_fishin,2009-10-03 00:38:00,481, Vanish??? really??? wait... that was a joke right?
389528,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-03 00:43:00,3761," LOL, o GCD seriously kiddo. Vanish = crap.  Never mind breaking my line I just want a fish at the end of the line. This river is a tough place to fish and since the rain a few days back this cold front has shut down the bass here in the river. Hopefully tomorrow some slow cranks, senkos, and a few other tricks will get a bite or two...my last fish of 2009 Can't be a 4lb Largemouth...I need something bigger"
389529,Greencoachdog,2009-10-03 00:43:00,8163,  Nope!... it's for the advanced fisherman!   ... take your neanderthal ass back to the boondocks eh!!!

No...I think he really meant it....shudder............. I tried Floroclear this year, and it was okay.  Nicked & frayed like a IQ challenged though, I went back to Tuf Line brain with 15' of PLine Flourocarbon.  Floroclear is still light years ahead of Vanish, shudder."

389558,Dabluz,2009-10-03 01:54:00,701,"I suggest that you take 4 feet of 15 lb test fluorocarbon P-Line and stretch between your arms and then do the same with some Berkley XL.  You will find that they are very similar in elasticity.  XL is very elastic.  The reason that fluorocarbon line is not as shock resistant is the fact that it is not as strong as mono and the knot strength is terrible.  Quit believing what the companies that sell the stuff say.  If they were selling cars, they would be in jail.  I'm actually surprised that no one has ever taken some of these companies to court.  Sure....with 15 lb test line....you might find that it is strong but when you go down to 6 lb test and compare it to 4 lb mono....you will quickly find out that 4 lb mono is better than 6 lb test fluorocarbon.  Try some simple tests at home....on the kitchen table.  Compare 15 lb test fluorocarbon against 10 lb test mono."
389562,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-03 02:00:00,3761," Will do, I was just looking for a good line to use for spinnerbaits and things like senkos, jerkbaits maybe and buzzbaits. Hope it works out, thanks though! I have used mono for a long time, this is a mono type line with fluorocarbon coating on it. Might be different then straight fluoro but we will see what happens.  Thanks for the response, MTBF"
389569,misfish,2009-10-03 02:12:00,29133,P-Line.      Use it all the time.
389570,Dabluz,2009-10-03 02:14:00,701," Ok....it's a co-polymer line.  I used a co-polymer line a long time ago when they first came out and didn't like it.  If I want a hard line, I use Berkley XT.  I cut my lines with my teeth....up to 20 lb test.  Been doing that for as long as I can remember.  I can tell if a line is soft or hard and even if it's abrasion resistant.  I can't cut Fireline nor braided line....lol.  However, a pike still can.  Especially those 3 to 6 lb pike."
389574,Greencoachdog,2009-10-03 02:21:00,8163,"  Ok, when was the last time you caught (if ever) anything this big???    One of the fillets off of your ""chump size"" bass would've made a nice cut bait for this BMF!!! (Bad Mother Fish)  You have my permission to print this photo out... but don't fold it in half before you go to sleep, you'll never get the 2 halves unstuck!!!  Yes you caught a nice Bass... but as far as it being a ""big fish"", it isn't!!!  FYI... what I said about P line is true, it's extremely weak!!!  ... and about the language in my earlier post... it's the way ""grown-ups"" talk, you may want to get used to that!...

389710,ecmilley,2009-10-03 19:21:00,2163,"I have had nothing but bad luck with p-line maybe i got a couple bad spools for the most part if i am not using braid i use trilene xt on cranking rods. Almost use seagar exclusivly as leader material, but if were to spool up with any flouro it would be silver thread it been the nicest casting to date for me, though i have heard good things about the newer trilene pro grade."

389792,pomoxis,2009-10-04 03:55:00,10,"Hey Mike: I've used different P-Line products over the past. Here's what I've found: - Fluoroclear is NOT a pure fluorocarbon.Rather a fluorocarbon core surrounded by copolymer. It's stretchy, similar to Trilene XL as someone had pointed out earlier. Positive side is that stretchiness makes it manageable especially in spinning reels. Bad side is that same stretchiness may not be as good on long distance hooksets or hard hooksets. - CXX is a copolymer and it's stiff, similar to Trilene XT. It's very abrasion resistant and has very low stretch, and has a larger average diameter compared to other P-Line products. I would suggest using this line only in baitcasting gear, as it may be too springy and hard to control on spinning gear. - CX is a mix between fluorocarbon and copolymer. It's a compromise between Fluoroclear and CXX. - Fluorocarbon is 100% fluorocarbon, and it's got low stretch and is pretty stiff, and abrasion resistant like all other 100% fluoros from other companies. The only downside is its price, whereas Fluoroclear, CXX and CX costs around $10-$13 a spool, 100% fluoro will run you $18-$22 for a spool.  I would recommend you (if you can) return the Fluoroclear, and get the CXX in Moss Green in 12lbs. The diameter is equivalent to 15lbs in other lines. It'll suit the power fishing style in your baitcasting gear. Cheers!"
