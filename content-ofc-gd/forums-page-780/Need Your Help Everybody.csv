386137,brandon,2009-09-23 03:40:00,857,"Hey Everybody,  As some of you know I spend most of my time down in the Photography area of OFC.  Posting photos on here has really helped me get where I am today with photography.  Feedback goes a long way.  If any of you are familiar with the photog section, you'll remember last month I travelled to Alaska to photograph Grizzly Bears.  When I got home I submitted one of the photos to a Contest.  I was notified this morning that my photo had been chosen by judges out of 1100 entries as a top 12 finalist and now it's up to the public to choose their favourite.  This is where I need your help.  If any of you have a moment to spare, please send a vote my way.  The voting page is located here: http://www.naturetrust.bc.ca/photocontest_voting.php  As I mentioned my photo is the one with the Grizzlies.....it also says ""bbroderick"" underneath.  Thanks in advance!!  Brandon Broderick"

388141,brandon,2009-09-29 13:47:00,857,"Thanks for the votes and the bump guys.  Category winners get a photo album that holds 40 13x19"" prints and a camera bag...worth about $150 in total and the grand prize winner gets a Nikon D90 Camera and 18-105mm lens I believe worth about $1500.  and frozen fire, make sure you've picked your favorite photo in each category.  I know that's where some people have had problems before  Thanks again guys"

389612,frozen-fire,2009-10-03 08:15:00,542,"The winning photo of the hummingbird in flight was great, but your photo of the grizzlies was also wonderfully captured.  Good luck next year.  Your photography inspires me."
