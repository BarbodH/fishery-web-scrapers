Permit fees for canoe trails areas? I pay every time I go into Algonquin Park, whether I am fishing or not.  I pay a license fee for fishing because the fact that I am fishing creates the need for more enforcement and more protection. Hikers, naturalists, recreational canoeists and other non-consumptive users are not taking anything from the resource, nor do their actions require near as much enforcement infrastructure.  Bird-watching license? I would gladly pay it if they would stock good birds in my favourite areas, pay COs to penalise folks that are harming the watchable birds, manage habitat specifically for those species, and do loads of research on the health of watchable bird populations."

So i wouldn't pay more,  the money goes to big business or something.  Since this is supposedly the final thread on Lake Ontario trib salmon, was curious of the difference between coho and chinooks. Apparently both are doing the same thing at this time of year, traveling upriver to spawn then die.  Why is it that coho are caught with more esteem, are they not both inedible and deteriorating on the inside? I know the coho looks more chrome-like as opposed to an old black 'boot'."
389315,kemper,2009-10-02 14:30:00,2232,Cohos seem to be more willing to take bait than chinooks...Actually I latched into two of them last weekend while drifting a pool full of chinooks without hooking a single chinny...

All the provincial stocking efforts on Lake Ontario is either trout or the useless doomed to fail Atlantic program.  The only reason there are still salmon on this side of Lady O is the efforts of volunteer groups to keep a viable chinook fishery in Ontario.  Hmmm swivel servants focus all of their efforts on useless fairy tales like Atlantics or the near useless Lake Trout, but actually go out of their way to shut down the premier sportfish in the province.  And you want to give these goons MORE money to burn?  Newsflash, the primary focus of the MNR isn't enhancing & promoting sportfishing."

I assume you mean ""get involved protecting the resources they use?""  Lots of non-consumptive users are already very involved in organisations like: -local Land Trusts: these are often protecting areas of significant natural interest and habitat that MNR has passed over, or are under the radar. -""Friends"" organisations of various parks and natural areas: nearly every large provincial park has a friends organisation that does everything from fund-raising to scientific monitoring -local, provincial, national and international environmental organisations: yes, I would include Ducks Unlimited here, but other well-known environmental organisations -citizen-science projects that contribute HUGE amounts of information to conservation efforts -hiking, biking, paddling and naturalists organisations that do a large amout of direct-effort projects (trail maintenance, clean-up, monitoring, habitat restoration....)  These folks are not ""antis"". In fact, many of them are both hunters/fishers as well as pursuing other uses of the resource.

However, when I was fishing near a local CA workyard I was approached by a representaive of the CA who explained to me that they monitor the area with satellite hi-res cams and are charging trespassers. I was in the river, not on their land, but he said they could and would charge me if the cameras recorded me stepping on the CA property.  I'm not convinced that the CA has the financial resources for that, or even that the technology is available to them. But it was interesting how the guy knew I was there because this site seems to have few if any employees on site very often, my car and I were not visible from the road and it was a Sunday morning. Certainly hi-res satellite photography is possible but I was under the impression it's the kind of thing only large defense departments of relatively wealthy countries can afford.  If in fact this is an affordable possibility, why couldn't MNR use this as a deterrent to poachers on the well-known sites? If they could monitor these areas, then they might be able to dispatch CO's when they see activity at a site. Perhaps it still comes down to the lack of funding and availability of CO's.  JF"

These are the people that truely love their work and put up with beauracracy and the revolving door of contracts to do something they are passionate about. A major issue is above this level. Career public service managers who wish to move up the chain of command are often taking jobs anywhere there is an advancement available. The result...an accountant managing an MNR region office. This will not likely change.  It sadly is up to all of us to make our voice heard. Again and again (and again) to MPPs. The vote seekers may hopefully see public interest in better managing of the MNR and resources.  Prehaps this can be a new front that OFAH will choose to lobby?? There is no excuse for this type of turing a blind eye because its salmon. Education and enforcement need to be stronger to change this culture. It will still take a few generations to remove it.

The CO's have know of this problem which has existed for 50, 100, who knows how many years.  More CO's on the rivers wouldn't change a thing unless the ''laws'' are changed.  There is no way a CO could prove one was snagging a fish, unless it was a plain treble hook. One could easily say ''I was using my lure to try and catch a fish, but there were so many, it caught the body.""  Only if the ''laws'' are changed can the CO's do something, and they know it."

I don't think spending extra monies to enforce tribs in the fall is very cost effective seeing the salmon will be dead in a week or so of entering the river and they don't reproduce and were stocked as a put and take fishery.

Actually, yes I do, believe that the CO's should be out there enforcing the already adequate laws we have. But IMHO throwing more money at the MNR is not the correct solution. If gov't. agencies and departments were adept at managing our (the taxpayer's) money and held to a reasonable level of accountability, there would be more than enough money to have CO's on the water.

But for every license dollar going in the province has withheld $1.25 from the MNR's budget, to the point where adjusted for inflation it's half where it was in 1994 before there was even a license.  The whole question is moot anyways, CO's will never increase in S.Ontario in the foreseeable future.  Hell it's more likely the MNR itself will be dissolved and it's parts divided between other ministries.  Heh Department Of Lands & Forests anyone?"

I believe that the majority of the MNR budget is funded through hunting and fishing licenses.  If the funding from general revenues were increased to reduce the percentage funded by licenses revenue down to say 1/3 then the other users would be funding the resourses via their tax dollars without creating and administrative nightmare.

I have never snagged a salmon...and never will...but money wise I think the best bang for our buck would be to have the stocking numbers increased slightly then just let the hooligans have at it for a couple of weeks in the fall. As long as the lake fishery doesn't suffer...what does it really matter?  Truthfully I'm far too busy chasing perch/crappie on Simcoe this time of year to worry about salmon.

As someone else pointed out, years ago our income, property and sales taxes took care of everything quite nicely. Now it seems all of our taxes go towards paying the salaries of our grossly oversized governement and everything else becomes a user fee. Anybody who thinks we need to pay more taxes on ANYTHING is out of touch with reality. Government agencies collect enough from us that they could run two countries the size of Canada.....but our money is shamefully mismanaged. If we only had some REAL acountability our taxes could actually decrease.  "
388869,Spiel,2009-10-01 12:00:00,9065,"Where's the ""remove chinook salmon option""?"
388874,bigfish1965,2009-10-01 12:10:00,3382, Please don't tempt me....lol.  My vote is for another 20 bucks and closing of the tribs on the first Saturday of September. We could then use the money for protection of more important resources. We could also then find out whether or not the chinook can be self sustaining.
388878,pikehunter,2009-10-01 12:17:00,1659,"Wayne, you beat me to it! Your entire reply was on the mark.  Some OFC members don't remember the days when fishing licenses were not required. They were first introduced to help pay for conservation and I can still here my father saying he didn't mind paying 3 bucks if it was indeed to help make fishing better, but has it? Then the idea was dropped and then re-introduced but of course the fee was now higher than the original 3 dollar charge."
388883,John,2009-10-01 12:28:00,2956,"Well, so far so good! It's refreshing to see a Trib Salmon thread reach 3 pages and remain civil. Kudo's to all.    OK, maybe it is a put and take fishery, BUT, it is also a mindset. Those who participate in this activity are breaking the law, whether we see it that way or not. They will have the same disrespect for our resources and for others no matter where they are and at what time of year. I'm not sure whether this is better policed by the ministry or our local constabulary.  By the way, if we had more transparency in where our $$ actually go once they arrive in the Provincial coffers I would gladly pay 100.00 a year for the privilege of fishing in this great Province."
388925,charlesn,2009-10-01 13:56:00,551,"OK, it's pretty obvious:  1) Some people don't trust the gov't to handle the funds properly 2) People that don't care about salmon don't want to pay more for enforcement on what they perceive as a nuisance species 3) Closing the rivers would be the easiest option (any police officer, fisherman or not, can enforce a closed season - much harder for them to be able to enforce a no flossing law) but any reduction in fishing opportunities is a negative 4) Lot's of volunteers around  So I have an idea that Dr. Sal can bring forward to Donna while she's getting her foot massage and pedicure.  Privatize the MNR regulation enforcement.  Basically, let my new company handle all the enforcement and we will do it just for the fine money, or even a portion of the fine money.  I will hire all the volunteers on this board at triple the standard volunteer rate and double it for overtime and weekends - I will even provide pepper spray or mace if it is on sale at Dollarama (at $15 /).  You want badges?  We will have badges.  We will lay charges like it is going out of style.  We will send retired NFLers to collect the fines and/or just start by confiscating the vehicles, gear and their pants well, just because.  And with all this fine money I will retire rich and happy.  Oops, I mean, we will all be happy and the rivers will be a peaceful serene place to be again.  I know it seems like I am doing all the work and you guys get all the glory and rewards, but I'm just selfless like that.  I'm even thinking of waiving the registration and training fee for volunteers.  So, who's in?  "
388927,StoneFly,2009-10-01 14:04:00,574, Or a Person!!!
388933,canadadude,2009-10-01 14:23:00,769,"I wouldn't give the MNR another cent, they already waste what monnies I give them in Liscences. There a joke from the Biologists on down. Dumping more money into an already useless ministry is just a bigger waste  I don't understand why the MNR does nothing with such flagrant violations going on in the few salmon tribs in the GTA, I've herd enough about the lack of CO's, they seem to get 6 or 7 of them to do Blitzes in Niagara every summer, they also get a bunch to police the commercial harvest on lake Erie. A couple of blitzes 2 weeks during the salmon run is all it will take to drasticly cut down on the circus going on right now. Come on MNR do somthing right instead of continually flushing away the $$$$$$$ you get now and stop crying about funding."
388708,bigfish1965,2009-09-30 22:39:00,3382,"This is going to be the final thread on the salmon fishing fiasco we see each year on Lake Ontario tribs. People snag, people are idiots...we know, we get it. The entire problem boils down to resources..specifically Conservation Officers. Without enforcement, rules are useless. But without the cash we cannot increase enforcement. We cannot have it both ways. We have not seen an increase in license fees in as many years as I can remember. It is long over due. How much more would you pay if all the cash went to more officers and more resource conservation and protection? Just for the sake of the discussion assume all the cash goes to the SPF and is above and beyond current financing levels. There are more than a million anglers licensed in Ontario....every dollar means one million more. Each million means about 7 more officers, give or take. Are you ready to put your money where you mouth is?? Increasing resident licenses would also allow us to reduce non-resident fees and help the north in tourism. Or if you have a better reasonable idea, put it forward."
388713,Radnine,2009-09-30 22:55:00,1538,You forgot to include $0. Jim
388715,ADB,2009-09-30 22:58:00,444, Agreed.  I think it'd be interesting to see how many people would vote for no increase whatsoever.
388716,Greencoachdog,2009-09-30 23:00:00,8163,"Does it really matter? Aren't they a put and take fishery and not actually self sustaining... aren't they all going to be dead in a week or 2 anyway?... and from what I understand, they aren't even fit to eat!... the only good part about them is the eggs to use for bait, and why not? The eggs won't hatch and they'll just be wasted anyway... might as well put them to good use!!!  Maybe they should just legalize the snagging of Salmon only???... wouldn't that be simpler?"
388717,steve_paul,2009-09-30 23:00:00,658,"   Agreed, $0  Rick, in all seriousness, I feel for you and the fellow mods at this time of year.  Good luck"
388718,irishfield,2009-09-30 23:03:00,26272,"You know better than to start a political thread here Rick!  There were more CO's and MNR employees before a fishing licence was even required by an Ontario resident. Our income tax rates were less as well and 'twas what covered the whole affair.  Our income tax rates are up, we now have to buy a fishing licence and there is less MNR staff...or at least the ones that do the ground pounding. Now as you say there are more than a million licenced anglers at what $20 average between conservation and sport licences. So where are the funds going...  In regards to Bronte creek.. never saw a CO down there 26 years ago either and we were there many many nights sitting under that bridge after our afternoon and night shifts from Consumers Glass.... with our marshmellows!    Some things in life never change I guess... just a new crowd.  As for that increase... if you could categorically positively guarantee an increase in CO's in an exact ratio to license fund increase vs salary.. I'm in !  If you are just wanting the CO's for the Salmon run... forget it. They are, as Dawg put it, put and take. The way to police it.. you buy tags for them similar to fishing a Fredriction area river system. Once your tags are filled... you go home now !"
388719,ADB,2009-09-30 23:03:00,444," Although it doesn't happen to the same degree, the law-breaking that occurs during the salmom run takes place with bass, walleye, pike, and every other species.  So as much as I'd like to see the salmon mess cleaned up, I'd also like to see the benefits of increased fees go to help guard our other fisheries as well."
388723,troutologist,2009-09-30 23:21:00,951,$40+ no problem if there was some type of accountability regarding where my money was spent.  Something like the district or region based Environmental Damages Fund. If a company in Sault Ste. Marie is fined by OMOE then it goes into a bank account and grant applications are taken to do environmental work in the area.  If a portion of your increased licence monies went to your backyard I think it would make more people dig into their pockets. Then another portion for province wide F&W endeavors. As it stands without a new influx of funds I'm afraid status quo would continue to degrade the resource.
388724,Bernie,2009-09-30 23:26:00,3190,Put me down for 0$ too. The money already isn't going to where it should. First they need to start reducing massive government overspending.
388725,misfish,2009-09-30 23:33:00,29133,"Like said,we already pay Rick.   Where did I put that lock????????????"
388732,bigfish1965,2009-09-30 23:43:00,3382,"Zero option added. Please explain your choices. All license fees do go to the MNR. Has been that way for a long time. The MNR used to be the biggest Ministry in the province. It is now a Junior Ministry. I think we have an obligation that goes with our right. The only other thing is that anglers are not the only people enjoying the natural resources but pay the lions share of protection. We need everyone pitching in. I like the salmon tag idea. Newfoundland does ( or did ) this. I remember as a kid having a newfoundland tag and sticking it on a chinny in the lower Niagara and releasing the fish. We thought it was funny...see someone catch a fish with a NFLD catch tag on it.  And to DAWG..it is a put and take fishery, but it has the potential to be somewhat self sustaining as waterways improve. Not only that but we have to protect it to protect the integrity of the sport."
388734,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 23:48:00,0,"I love this only as it is, our licensing fees don't go to resources, they go into the provincial coffers.  If there was a direct link between revenue generated by licensing/fines and our resources, I would gladly pay more for my license.  Unfortunately our licensing fees are likely going to pay for Ontario Lottery Gaming luncheons in Toronto, and pedicures for Donna Cansfield!"
388736,Twocoda,2009-09-30 23:49:00,4130,1 change the laws to 75 feet up and down stream from ANY man made obstructions ( cost zero) 2 install cameras on man made obstructions (night vision capable) in the rivers... 3 shifts during peak times monitoring and acting as a dispatch to send in the Calvary .impose river rehabilitation service as a part of the punishment X amount of hours ( serves the communities and educates the ignorant to the resource they are raping  ( cost self sustaining from increased fines incurred) 3 increase licenses accordingly to aid in accommodating a Calvary during peak spawning times ( students of the field to apply X amount of hours for practical purposes towards their graduation ( doubles or triples the feet on the ground writing tickets ) 4 Increase non resident licenses for EVERYONE that isnt a Canadian citizen and they MUST hire a guide) Guide MUST be an active member of a fish club with X amount of hours logged in river rehab or stocking 5 Increase non resident licenses for Canadians ( guide not required )   these are first thoughts that come to mind....i know every action has a re- action ...so have at it ...
388739,BrownTown,2009-09-30 23:51:00,103,I'd pay $100 bucks a year....This is going towards something i have a passion for and love.  As long as it goes back into the resources then I'm for it. Hell i pay 70 bucks american to fish stateside maybe 5 times a year?
388740,misfish,2009-09-30 23:52:00,29133," You mean hunters? Even they/we, are seeing less protection. IMO"
388741,bigfish1965,2009-09-30 23:53:00,3382, Actually our license fees go to the MNR SPF. Has been that way since 1995. All fines collected via resource violations also go to the fund. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_166024.html  I work for the OLG..we have lots of our own cash...lol.
388743,bigfish1965,2009-09-30 23:54:00,3382," I don't know what hunters pay for licenses, but no I wasn't speaking of them. Hikers, naturalists, etc all enjoy what anglers and hunters pay to keep protected. I like the user pay system, myself. But not all users are paying."
388746,StoneFly,2009-10-01 00:01:00,574,"I would pay alot more than $40 if it meant, then Chinnies were out, but Steelhead, Browns, atlantics (?) could take they're places, my thought is that there would be much more room for these more desirable fish and by default,..the loogans would be out due to time of year, lack of sight fishing etc."
388747,dave524,2009-10-01 00:01:00,4508,"I voted zero, when I was 15, there was no PST,  no GST, no fishing licence, small game licence was $1 plus 15 cents issuing fee, no duck stamp, no PAL, no FAC and I could walk into the local hardware store at 15, pick up a box of 12 gauge shells for $1.99, heck if I was short there were partial boxes with an X in marker on the top and he would sell them for 10 cents apiece and to top it off, The Department of Lands and Forest had more CO's in the field. Ain't progress grand ???"
388748,misfish,2009-10-01 00:02:00,29133,"  Well, if you look up what we as hunters pay,you will see that we pay awhole lot more then a fishing lic. Small games,moose,deer,bear,waterfowl and even more. A hunter that participates in all, would pay out about 400+ dollars,heck thats low balling, just for tags and lic.A far cry from what anglers pay.  Just for your info.  Lets get like the hunter and pay per fish we want to target? Yes thats crazy talk,but hey,we as hunter have to pay to play too.  This could get interesting.  The MNR is not just about the fisheries.  SRY Rick, didnt mean to highjack your thread."
388751,Fang,2009-10-01 00:10:00,1330,cut the river seasons down to protect spawning fish. simple enough. There's tons of rivermouths and estuary areas for both spring and fall  we protect all other species but salmon
388753,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-01 00:12:00,0," the problem with this comparison is that there are no incidental catches in hunting (i hope)... i can target walleye but mortally wound a muskie.  i hope you aren't out hunting deer, but accidentally shoot a grouse."
388758,Greencoachdog,2009-10-01 00:19:00,8163,"  That's an excellent idea!!!... and the best way to kill your tourism trade if that's what you want... maybe we should start charging Canadians $1000 a head to enter the U.S on their way to Florida for the winter, it would definitely cut down on the winter riff-raff down there!!!"
388760,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-01 00:23:00,0, but who will go to tampa bay lightning games?
388762,misfish,2009-10-01 00:25:00,29133," I have paid to hunt both(both paid for,two seperate lic),and it would not be an accident.  Theres the difference."
