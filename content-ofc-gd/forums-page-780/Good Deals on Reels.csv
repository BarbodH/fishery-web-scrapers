388596,leighfns,2009-09-30 16:36:00,103,Cabelas.ca has some good deals on the go for reels right now.  http://www.cabelas.ca/bargain_cave/?SrchSe...p;currentpage=3  Curado e7 $150 and a good price in the new Quantum Energy PT (5:1) aswell..  I just switched from right handed to left handed baitcasters.. if not I may have to pull the trigger on one or both of those .
388602,capt bruce,2009-09-30 17:05:00,820,"Thats a real good reel deal , say that three times fast , thanks for the heads up ."
388608,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-30 17:35:00,53,The Curado 2ooE is an excellent reel deal. I bought a 300E (larger line capacity) earlier this year. It is a phenominal reel. Jack.

388978,mbosh1980,2009-10-01 15:43:00,349,"yeah, i ended up ordering one of the spinning reels.  i'm 'reel'y getting addicted to gear."
389457,leighfns,2009-10-02 19:54:00,103, Awesome....  This reel looks like a good deal and I have always wanted to try one out  https://www.cabelas.ca/index.cfm?pageID=69&...on=&ID=8982  Someone grab it and let me know if t is worth it
389463,Dabluz,2009-10-02 20:07:00,701,  The CiticaE is just as good and costs 100 dollars less.
389464,Dabluz,2009-10-02 20:10:00,701,"  Last year I bought a Shimano Cardiff 101A (also a round baitcaster) for 60 dollars on sale from 160 dollars (in Canada).  Very nice reel.  From what I have heard, the problem with BPS or Quantum reels is the lack of spare parts....especially the bearings."
389470,Hellfish,2009-10-02 20:49:00,308, IMO there is no shortage of bearings for the Quantums at all have had mine replaced with no issues.
389535,leighfns,2009-10-03 00:49:00,103, I think he meant to say cabela's
389572,Dabluz,2009-10-03 02:20:00,701,"From what I have read on other fishing sites, BPS reels and Cabela's reels....at least some of them....it is hard to find someone who will repair them.  However, some of those reels are made by companies who also make brand name reels like Quantum, Pflueger, etc and very often the reels are almost exactly the same and many parts are interchangeable."
