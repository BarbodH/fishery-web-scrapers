385701,kickingfrog,2009-09-22 01:03:00,8333, Your own buddy's report on the other site puts quite a few holes in your claims.  Question: Are you claiming that the fish that Tony is pictured with at the beginning of this post is a fish that was dead for 24-48 hours before it was photographed?
385713,hammercarp,2009-09-22 01:42:00,964,He will probably blame his mysterious phantom nephew that steals his identity causes trouble.
385778,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-22 09:19:00,1107," hears a little caption straight from the section of 08/09 fishing regs entitled it is illegal to.  â€¢ Abandon fish or permit the flesh to spoil.so basicly your admiting to breaking the law which your buddies post on the other board contradicts as he said ""she was still full of life"" you steve-o are a real clown and should appologize for your stupidity .  Tonyb awesome win and beauty fish make sure ya post a pic of the boat when you get it."
385781,crappieperchhunter,2009-09-22 09:54:00,2582,I hope this is the last we see of steve-o on here. Members like that we don't need.  TonyB well done!!!! Enjoy your prize.
385816,anders,2009-09-22 13:12:00,1168,Bahahahahahaha  I think Busted is the word here Steve O  Congrats again Tony...well done
385823,Lunker777,2009-09-22 13:26:00,866,This is hilarious !  Congrats Tony.... And Steve-o.... Take it like a man.... Better luck next year
385855,BITEME,2009-09-22 14:48:00,1968,To Steve-o and the guy holding the fish  Fish Holder I know who you are and you know me and my family very well all I can say as a Bronte Boy I would of expected alot different from you what is up with that. I think you need to make nice and suck this crap up .Poor sport you should not be And I can tell you when I see you again I will let you know how I really feel Its a small world and I will likely see you at Franks or on the peir or who knows on the water even. Oakville is a small place  oh yeah BITEME   CONGRATS TONY NICE WIN MAN!!!!!!!!
385952,CLofchik,2009-09-22 19:48:00,854,"   To be fair to others that don't know him, I've fished next to him & the rest of the Bronte regulars for a number of years and he's generally been a good guy.  Maybe not too bright in not double checking the dates, but I'm sure he genuinely thought somebody scooped up his fish."
385967,crappieperchhunter,2009-09-22 20:40:00,2582, If you read his report from the other board...it was stated that the fish swam away healthy. How you gonna scoop up that?

It really sucks when someone makes up some stupid story to try come out a hero  . I'm guessing he's regreting it at this point now that 5000+ fishin dudes think he's an idiot.

I can't believe someone would make such a public accusation against Tony.  I have known Tony for a long time, and I have fished with him for years.  I have never witnessed him do anything even remotely unethical.  Tony is a stand-up guy that always follows the regs, and promotes following the regs.  I fish with Tony all the time in the derby, and I know how much time and effort he puts on the water for the derby with me, and by himself.  Congrats on catching such a great derby winning salmon Tony.  I wish I was in the boat with ya.  Aaron"

384605,steve-o-,2009-09-18 18:27:00,5,"Next time TONY don't pull a foolish belly up fish out of the water. We caught that fish and released her 30 minutes after you got her, we hooked into her at 5:45 pm on Aug 27th and took 30 minutes to land her, she slipped out of my buddies hands when we were releasing her and she went belly up, couldn't do nothing about it as the waves were 2-3 feet and pushing her fast. Tony you dam well know what you did, you grabbed a fish that was floating and took it in for weight in. I HAVE THE PROOF. For everyone else look at it this way, he launched out of Bronte at 7 pm, got out to 50-60 FOW (may have taken 10 from launch time) 7:15 pm out to his spot ( 5 minutes to set up) 7:20 he gets a fish on and lands a 33 lbs in only 5 minutes ( I DONT THINK SO) then back to the launch by let's say 7:45 pm, loads up and drives up to Franks all in 15 minutes ( IMPOSSIBLE) that Lamp Ray Mark was in the same spot as our fish and just as pink as ours, we pulled the freaken lamp ray off of it. I have video and pictures of everything. Now who looks like the A$$. You see when your in a Derby of high stack's you will do just about anything to win it just as long as you don't get caught, there was only 3 other boats out that night ( Myself and buddy and one of our other friends in a 29 foot cabin curser) we stayed out till midnight. Again I have nothing to lose as I wasn't even in the derby but to have someone win by this means is ridiculous. Shame on you little T. I think Tomorrow will be very interesting at the presentation"

384879,steve-o-,2009-09-19 16:10:00,5,"Just a little proof to back my ass up. I will not show the rest until the time is needed, but again here's a little sample. Here's Tony's fish before he grab it out of the water it bellied up in our boat after we landed her, my buddy tried to release her carefully but she was so heavy he dropped her by accident, we caught her at 6:15 pm Aug 27th in 80 FOW 48 down and 100 back, 30 minutes to land her, weight 34 lbs. HUMMMMM that means she went back in the water at 6:45 -6:50 and then was pulled out just after 7ish by you know who. I'm not here to crap distrub or anything else, I don't want anything out of this but to let everyone know that Tony's fish was NOT caught legally and he just grabbed a belly up fish out of the water to win his boat. Tony you may be a really nice guy and all and just by reading some of your post's you seem decent, but I've heard from friends of yours that you are not the ethnical fishermen some of us out here think you are, remember all the out of season fishing you do, another thing that looks bad on you. Now here's the video, you guys be the judge. Have a look at the fish when its in the boat, then look at Tony's picture of his fish in the boat. Now maybe you guys will believe me.  photobucket  "
385663,bigfish1965,2009-09-21 22:56:00,3382,"TonyB has requested we set everything visible on this thread. He wishes for his name to be cleared and we wish to give him that chance. New evidence has also come to light. This fish was reported as caught by steve o on another site with a report the DAY BEFORE he claims to have caught it on this site. After looking at the pics they are both similar in size, but you can clearly see the lamprey mark on Tony's fish is well healed and certainly not a fresh mark. There are other minor differences in the two fish. Anyway...have a look and form your own opinion. They are similar in size...I think steve's fish is actually a titch bigger but can't be sure. Bt since they are staging in the same area they are likely fromt he same hatchery and would of course look very similar."
385666,tonyb,2009-09-21 23:00:00,1637," Thank you Rick.  The video shows no lamprey scar, like the fish I caught, and I landed my grand prize winning fish on August 27th in the evening.  Steve-o caught his on August 25th...although he is a good liar.   Now click the URL below for the full details of his catch, noting the date and time of the report...  http://www.niagarafishing.net/forums/index...showtopic=17303  Steve-o, I suggest you buy a derby ticket next year, that was a great catch you had.  Further, I would appreciate a public apology for your false accusation of me cheating, if you could.  Thanks, Tony"
385668,danbouck,2009-09-21 23:10:00,4380," Sorry buddy on your Niagara fishing report you caught it on the 25th. You should remember to buy a derby ticket, maybe next year you won't be as jealous when you don't win.  Again Great job Tony"
385683,Ziki,2009-09-22 00:10:00,128,"Steve-o, you should forward this information and any other you have to the Derby Committee instead of wasting your time here. You may not care enough but I'm sure the person that finished 2nd that week sure does.  You are only going to anger the board members here if you keep posting more evidence. It's clear that Tony is a well respected member here and I get the feeling some administrators might feel that the board would lose face if a long standing member turned out to have cheated in the derby."
385684,hammercarp,2009-09-22 00:20:00,964,Nice fish Tony. Congradulations.

384256,bigfish1965,2009-09-17 16:13:00,3382," Pretty brave..well actually STUPID..to come on here and say something like this. If you want to throw such innuendo around, and since this is your first post and you decided to be a keyboard hero, your IP address is recorded and available. Saying something like this can get you into a boatload of trouble. We at OFNCommunity have no doubt about Tony's catch and his standing in the community. If you have a legitimate beef, I would suggest you contact the tournament committee. Otherwise you are simply a jealous, cowardly punk on an internet forum. And yes, I mean everything I just said."
384259,tonyb,2009-09-17 16:22:00,1637,"Steve-o, I don't know you at all but I hope you aren't accusing me of cheating.  If you are, I will gladly take a lie detector test, and if I fail I will pay you $30,000, If I pass, you pay me $30,000 deal?  I didn't post the whole story on here...but did on a couple other more trolling specific boards.  You are pretty much correct in your summary though, and what makes it all even sweeter as that I did it on my own!  Here is the copy/paste from spoonpullers.com...at your request...  I wasn't planning on going fishing that night, I had even texted my wife saying the night looks like a write-off. The forecasted winds were saying 20-22KM E and we all know what that does to the West end of the lake. As a result of that, I stayed a bit later at work, with no need to be in that mode where every minute counts, trying to get out for a weeknight solo fish.  Well, when I returned to Burlington, the winds weren't blowing like they were in Cambridge, so I decided to take a drive by the lake. When I got down there and saw it wasn't bad at all, the race was on! and I decided to go out after all. I call it the race, because of what is involved. I have to go to the Burlington GO station, find a parking spot for the car, then hop in the truck and head home to hook up the boat, change, etc.  So after seeing the lake, the race is on to get home to the boat and wouldn't you know it, but the roads in Burlington were absolutely jammed everywhere, and I was hitting every red light, and even got stuck in that left turning lane coming up Brant St., a turning lane that I didn't want to turn with but I wasn't going to cut people off to get my way, so a 5 minute detour and I am back on the planned route.  Get home, change, hook up the boat, skip dinner and I'm back on the road, and start making the trek over to Bronte...and after what seemed like forever, I make it to the launch. I back the boat in, and there is someone at the ramp obviously with some type of trouble in a small green Legend. ""Can you give me a boost?"" he asks... ""Sure! no problem"" I say, call me a sucker I guess but I'm always looking for opportunities to top up the 'Karma bank account'. I am a big believer of the 'pay it forward'/'what goes around comes around' cheeseball crap, So I pull my cranking battery out from under my rod locker and hand it to his buddy. They hook it up and it doesn't work! but then, after some fiddling, he manages to start up his main, and they were elated!  Ready to get on their way they asked if I had been out recently and as I was the night before, I told him to fish in less than 60fow - ""Really are you serious!?"" they asked shockingly, 'Absolutely!' I told them...  At this point, I was about to explode with impatience inside, as it's already closing in on 7pm! And it is getting darker and darker earlier now so there is not much time left in the evening to fish. However, in the back of my mind, the previous nights experience told me that the bites turned on as the sun was setting...so I remained as calm as I could be and finished the tasks at hand.  After tying up the boat, there are no spots to park anywhere, so I have to drive to the alternative parking lot at the top of the hill (Keep in mind I am by myself!) And I hate leaving the boat unattended like that for that long, but alas, it is what it is at Bronte.  Finally, I am out of the harbour and pounding through 5 footers to get upwind/wave to begin my troll. My program was adapted to the conditions as it is too difficult to manage everything solo and run fancy outfits like lead or even dipsy divers as the dropoff near the mouth comes up/down rapidly and I wanted to work my baits near bottom.  I was running spoons (again from what the previous nights success showed me), and I wanted them rotating and darting near those dark ledges and crevaces where monsters congregate to make dinner plans.  The rods are now set, sonar tweaked, fish hawk telling me to slow down, and I settle into my troll, much, much shallower than the surprisingly large pack of boats working the usual break. Remember my report from the night before? all those big, juicy hooks in the shallow, now cooler waters were definately Kings...and I was marking them again!  It was probably only about 10 or 15 minutes into the troll when the heavy cloud cover eclipsed the setting sun, and like the low light bite the night before, I got that fishy feeling again, you guys know the one. I slowly turned scanning both rods, anticipating something to happen, it had to!...  My frantic pace from earlier had all but left my mind at this point, I was in the zone, and I can't think of anything else that I enjoy doing that can eliminate stress and slow down the pace like fishing can for me, it's no wonder I am an addict to the pursuit of these critters, I love it!  The BIG moment arrived when I saw the fish hit, and hit hard on the passenger side rigger rod. I lept into action! like a dog springs to it's feet when you walk in the front door after a long day at work, and grabbed the rod to feel what the fish was all about. Turns out, it had a one-way express ticket to a far away destination, and I took that window of opportunity to clear my other rod.  I stuffed the fish-on rod back into the rigger holder, darted across the boat and reeled in the other rigger rod, hit the auto-up switches on both riggers and returned to the fish-on rod. I had to do a double-take at the Tekota's line counter, it was at 600 and climbing! but slowing, until it rolled around to just over 700 feet! and came to a stop.  Alright! I think and I began applying pressure and pumping it back to the boat. I must say, I am really liking 'the walk' technique (walking backwards in the boat, then forward to pickup slack line)  I slowed the boat down in the surging 5 foot waves, and continued methodically retrieving the beast. I eventually got it near the boat, and it stayed deep, took me back and forth a few times threatening a break off on a propeller or engine keel, and darted at one time near the surface and did that open-mouthed-heart-stopping-headshake tactic...holy crap the heart skiped a beat or two!  I knew I had a big fish...but it was hard to see clearly with the chop, dark skies, and no polarized glasses, and from what I saw didn't appear that long! I had a couple chances with the net but when the fish got close to the boat, it made a couple last ditch effort runs, until I was able to bring the fish close enough to skillfully slide the net under it with my one hand, while heaving back on the rod with the other.  The position is almost like you are hanging off the back of a garbage truck reaching way out to hand someone a rolled-up newspaper  I quickly stuffed the relieved rod into a holder so I could use both hands on the net to heave the fish aboard. When I hoisted it over the gunnel, I knew what I had laying at my feet, a Derby Fish! but there was no time to relish in the moment, the fish was bleeding and after unhooking it went right into the livewell.  I glanced at the time, and it was 7:37, holy crap I need to get moving! Rods and everything were basically just thrown into the bottom of the boat for the run in.  Everytime I drive the Lund, I am impressed with how it handles the water, and this is one of those cases where having a boat that can withstand some serious pounding helped me.  I pushed the throttle down and began my race back to the ramp, trying to beat the closing weigh-scale at Bronte Outdoors in less than 25 minutes!  The boat bashed through waves with ease like a fat kid playing Red Rover, and in no time I was back at the boat ramp. No time for bumpers, tie the boat up, and RUN!  Remember that alternative parking lot!!? damn me!  I felt like I was trying out for some crazy Japanese reality tv show like Unbeatable Banzuke. I ran the whole way across the field, up the stairs, through the forest and to the truck, hopped in and zoomed down to the ramp.  If anyone has been to Bronte launch you know there are about 35 speed bumps from the road to the ramp (ok not that many but it seems that way when you are in a hurry!) It was torture! But I stayed focused to get the trailer lined up perfectly and get the boat on the trailer locked down and properly in one swift attempt, no issues let's roll!  More torture over the speed bumps, and I eventually screech into the Bronte Outdoors parking lot right up front, ignoring the parking spaces entirely, and racing inside at minutes before close!  The fish hit the scales and my eyes lit up as the digital readout settled firmly at 33.76, the hair stood up on the back of my neck, and I shouted Wooohoo! hell yeah...HELL YEAH!  Pics removed from this spot as they were included in the initial post  Everything can change with a single bite, and that is what makes the GOSD so exciting and available to anyone who fishes it, you just never know!!!  Specifics about the behemoth  Caught at 48' down over 50' out in front of Bronte. Temps were 56 degrees at depth, 68 at the surface. Speed 2.3mph at the probe.  The lucky lure was an old favorite Big Ern, can't recall the name of it, but it's a little worse for wear now    Mission Accomplished...  http://www.sportshows.ca/SalmonDerby/updates.php  Thanks for reading!

Here is a picture of the other 33.70 pound fish, caught Aug 1st...which we didn't enter into the GOSD because not everyone on the boat had a derby ticket!      Advanced Taxidermy has both fish in their freezers at the moment as they are both being mounted.  Gman (in the picture at the top) with his new PB King and me with my weekly winner, both good reasons to put a fish on the wall.   We won $1000 for Gmans fish because Zane (kid in the picture) entered his 34.64lb fish the same day into the GOSD and held on to win it!

Just remember this people were out on the water that day and took alot of picture and video of different things, I seen your fish at Franks and that Lamp ray mark looked very familiar, actually the whole fish did. I'm not going to crap disturb any farther. Your a lucky guy to win that boat but again I state look around before you do something and make sure people aren't watching you. if I posted what I have on this forum I'd be a hero in some peoples eye and a excellent person in others. So this is not to be an ass but to remind you of how close you are to trouble. If anyone wants to see what I have please feel free to contact me and meet me at Bronte Pier, I'd be MORE then happy to show.  By the way if this is a serious offence in what I'm claiming I'd be more then happy to take it to the Beaver. I have no reason to come out here and crap on anyones parade but when I found out about Tony winning the prize 3 days ago I've be contemplating about going public.  Tony I bet you caught the fish (caught being the key word) between the first two apartment building just to the right of the 2nd lighthouse about 1/2 km out."
384297,tonyb,2009-09-17 17:36:00,1637,"Please show then, I have nothing to hide, but it sounds like you do..."
384303,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-17 17:51:00,627,Don't worry about the jealousy of others Tony. Congratulations.  We put a fish into my old boat that was 33.6 back in 91 durring the Star derby. At that time that was a small fish but hung on to win us about $150. worth of lures. Now it seems a lot harder to break the 30 lb mark and you have definately worked for it.  Tom.

378538,Ziki,2009-08-31 19:56:00,128, Due to the town of Oakville banning public fishing in some areas Tony has decided not to continue his rehabilitation work in Oakville.   PS great fish Tony!! Which boat are you going to keep?

378661,tonyb,2009-09-01 01:04:00,1637,"Wow good memory Ziki!  I'll be keeping my 1900 ProV over the 18 foot Rebel, so I am hoping to find a buyer..interested?  As for the cleanup...I took the 'No Trespassing' (Anglers Only Edition) to heart at the park so now those buggers can clean their own park for all I am concerned.  Maybe one day the city of oakville will turn 'angler friendly' and they will gain the support from anglers in regards to park cleanups, tree planting, etc...  But luckily, there is someone else who is still not jaded, and is carrying the torch forward...Send a pm to 'Burtess' on the board, as I believe he organized it last year.  ask him to show you his secret steelhead haunts too"
