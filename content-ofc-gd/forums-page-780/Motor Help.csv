Well Saturday I got up and tried to solve the problem. took the spark plugs out and they had a white milky look to all of them. I called a local marina and they think it might be water in the gas tank .  Fisrt Question would be . The tank is in the hull of the boat , how would water get in there  Also what is the solution if it water ot fix it , I am assuming all of the gas will have to come out"
390315,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-05 15:53:00,947,Yea white milky is water mixing with oil.  Your gonna have to drain the tank and put fresh gas in.  Cause could be to much ethanol gas use over the years.  I would recommend you use a non ethanol gas such as Shell V-power (91 octane) or Ultra Mar premium (91octane) they both don't have ethanol.
