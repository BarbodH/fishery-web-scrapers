389929,Leecher,2009-10-04 20:38:00,7832,"Today got out for about an hour to test the wooden popper I had made.... was the only one that I hadn't used yet. Started at the same location as yesterday and I'm real proud to report that I was able to catch a small bass with it  There was no wind but heavy clouds hanging over.... I was lucky cause a thunderstorm was coming our way and  was only able to put in an hour.  I've made a series of videos and hope you like them..... so without further adieu here are the videos.  Enjoy  Don't laugh at the way I'm looking all over the place cause there was people near the car looking at me and they thought I was talking to the steering wheel LOL  Intro:    Testing in my workshop    My pride and joy    and the release!!!    Just before I left, I had change my lure for a chartreuse spinnerbait..... a big fish slammed it but unfortunately it got away before I could see it  Still the testing of my lures and the time spent along the waters was a real treat and the results were phenomenal  Leechman"

389959,GBW,2009-10-04 21:19:00,8460,"wow Jacques, you are 'the man' with the new self made wooden baits.  good job!"
389962,Leecher,2009-10-04 21:23:00,7832, Thanks GBW much appreciated
389969,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:31:00,8163,"Another excellent report, pics, fish, and vids Jacques!!!  You need to be careful about making your own lures... it can be addictive!!! I had to go into ""lead jig"" rehab earlier this year, I was becoming addicted to the powder paint fumes!!!.. there isn't any other high quite like a powder paint buzz yanno!  Thanks for taking the time to post that wonderful report Bubba!!!"
389971,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-04 21:32:00,0,I think you stuck the lures in their mouth after you caught them with a piece of worm..                                          I'm kidding. Nice to have something you've made work for you.
389984,Leecher,2009-10-04 21:48:00,7832, Thanks Glen!!!  ADDICTION   :blink:   you think I should enroll into rehab???   I don't know..... ain't that bad yet    only made 5 of them..... I promise   Thanks gbfisher!!!
389987,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:51:00,8163, ... we'll wait and see what happens this winter Jacques... but I'm thinking there's going to be lots of wood dust on the shop floor!
389993,Leecher,2009-10-04 22:01:00,7832, Yeah Glen.... after hunting season and waiting for hard water..... you can be sure I'll be vacuuming saw dusk off the floor in the workshop Then maybe I'll book an appointment in rehab     but mine won't be as addictive as yours.... it's only wood dust and not fumes   :P
390004,Dabluz,2009-10-04 22:20:00,701,"Nice videos.....clear and sharp focus.  I think you would make a lot of money making porn videos...lol.  You never see porn/fishing videos.  I see no reason why a handmade lure cannot be as good as a factory made lure....especially the easy to make lures like poppers, walk the dog lures, gliding lures, lures like Suicks etc.  I know that I make way better flies, worm or minnow harnesses, fly leaders,  than those I can buy in any boutique.  I have a question....  Is the lure made of 2 parts of wood glued together with wire running through the lure to secure the hooks to the eyelet?  What kind of wood do you use?  I would love to make some larger lures for pike."
390015,Leecher,2009-10-04 22:44:00,7832," Thanks Dabluz!!!  All of the lures I made except for one, are one piece made out of pine.  The two piece was the Jitterbug.  There's no wires going through them to secure the screw on eyes...  I usually add carpentry glue on the thread of the screw on eye so to secure it.  So far so good!!!  Pine is light, cheap and floats on top of water like any other wood..... but I think price had a major influence on my decision and that's the main reason I selected it.  It's such a rewarding feeling to make them and then catch a fish with it.  They are quite time consuming to make but reward is sweet.  Bigger size lures will definitely catch bigger pike..... will be working on a bigger bug for next year.... 6"" compared to the one I made 3""  Hope this answers your question but if not please fell free to pm me.   I say go crazy and create your version of it and test it..... that's the only way  Tight lines Leechman"
