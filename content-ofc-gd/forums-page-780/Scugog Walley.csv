I was out at the end of my dock last night and hooked into a few decent pickeral using shiner minnows and a slip bobber in only 4 feet of water.....the pics are coming onto the shoreline to chase minnows at dark...my suggestion would be to find a creek or culvert off the shore and pop in a live minnow under a slip float (good spot would be downtown at the public launch on the east side-it dips in there and has a nice culvert....go early to beat out the ""shore rats"" that come at dark)....or find a nice point that has a dock or sandy bottom with no weeds. Watch out for the odd Musky that will follow in the pickeral.....we got one last Spring off the dock."

389716,kemper,2009-10-03 20:35:00,2232,beautiful  post exact locations...especially one like that that already gets RAMMED with people.  are you kidding me!?
389717,Radnine,2009-10-03 20:52:00,1538," Yah, now everyone will go to that culvert on lake Scugog. And try getting your hands on slip bobber now!!! Jim"
389718,kemper,2009-10-03 20:53:00,2232, Im not saying that a ton of people didnt already know...but if you have fished there you know that 4 people is too many.
