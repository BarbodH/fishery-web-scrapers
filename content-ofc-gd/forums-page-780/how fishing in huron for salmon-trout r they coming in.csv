389672,BillM,2009-10-03 16:08:00,17367, Anytime man   You'll notice a few trends around this time of year.... This is one of them.
389677,timmeh,2009-10-03 16:29:00,609,  I second Las on this. It should be the official response to questions like this.  OR  You could just post this link http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp   And you're right Johnny this post does sound quite similar to a previous post.......
