389151,denisk,2009-10-01 23:23:00,163,"It's still dirty from the weekend, water temp dropped from 68-61 since sunday"
389168,Rizzo,2009-10-02 00:00:00,4754,thanks for the update. I'm trying to figure out if its worth it to drag the boat from Barrie. Which direction of wind makes it worse or does it not matter?
