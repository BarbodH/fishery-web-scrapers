389695,cranks bait,2009-10-03 17:52:00,721,I had this on one of my reels a couple of years ago.  It didn't last long.  Felt like I was fishing with a rubber band.  I couldn't feel any hits.  I tried it for about a month and then cut it off the spool.  For me it was not any good at all.
389696,Greencoachdog,2009-10-03 17:55:00,8163,It sounds mean!!!
389704,Twocoda,2009-10-03 18:58:00,4130,i suggest you get a sample of it and try it in your releases ....when braid first came out ..i spooled two reels with it and the line wouldnt stay in the release very well (it was too thin)...tons of knock offs ....but i did keep one rod set up with it for a dipsy and flat lining  If you do try it ...let me know your opinion...thanks...
389731,John,2009-10-03 22:49:00,2956,"Thanks guys, and you Glen   ...I may give it a try one reel next year."
389817,singingdog,2009-10-04 11:48:00,1047,"Good line for me. I have the 4 lb, high vis spooled on my favourite trout fishing combo and like it alot. It seems to have good knot strength, good castability, and good abrasion resistance...what's not to like?"
