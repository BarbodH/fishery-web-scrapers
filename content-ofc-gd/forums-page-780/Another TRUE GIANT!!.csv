389399,fishingisliving,2009-10-02 17:00:00,170,"No fair !! Because im 6ft 235lbs i cant brag, i make my 50,51,52,53 inchers look like 25 and 30 pounders. If i lose 50 pounds will my fish then magically weigh 50 lbs? Cause i would lose the weight...  Nah i love food too much."
389401,misfish,2009-10-02 17:02:00,29133,"  Im not laughing Andy  Lots of time guys. And Stan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NO, against my religion   COUGH COUGH."
389402,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-02 17:05:00,0,that makes it even funnier......
389411,Crazyhook,2009-10-02 17:19:00,1154, I hear you being 6 feet and 215 is really tough on my fishing pictures
389413,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-02 17:22:00,1022,"trying being 6'4"" and 300"
389414,misfish,2009-10-02 17:25:00,29133, That would be a he ll of a fish. OOPS
389419,Greencoachdog,2009-10-02 17:32:00,8163,"He said the fish bottomed out his 50 lb. scale, which in actuality was probably a 15 lb. scale."
389421,bucktail,2009-10-02 17:35:00,1857,It was a 5.0lb scale!
389444,johnnyb,2009-10-02 18:59:00,3413,"NIce fish, no two ways about it....too bad about the article though.  8 pound rod?!?  Wha??!?"
389483,Kinger,2009-10-02 21:54:00,351,He is so creepy.  Thumbs up for a 20lber. Creepy little bugger.
389484,ecmilley,2009-10-02 22:01:00,2163,"I wouldnt do a muskie of anysize the injustice of holding it vertically or hanging it off a hook to weigh it, but that being said i would say 20-24lb max max max nice fish but as an angler we can all embellish a bit can't we? my biggest fish was 52"" big fat october fish and it was somewhere between 33-36 lbs as a guess it would eat the fish he's holding."
389496,BrownTown,2009-10-02 22:43:00,103,by 50lbs i think they meant the individual holding it..
389632,lhousesoccer,2009-10-03 12:25:00,442,"Did anyone notice all the blood around the muskie's head and gills in the pic of the guy holding it vertically (the WRONG hold, by the way for a muskie).  And then he releases it?"
389646,Pepe,2009-10-03 13:29:00,21,"It's the guy who weighs 50 lbs, come on guys , you got it all wrong !!!! lol"
389671,bigfish1965,2009-10-03 15:58:00,3382,"It was netted by his wife...uhhh....Morgan Fairchild, yeah that's it. That's the ticket!"

389312,Crazyhook,2009-10-02 14:28:00,1154,Classic! must be a really strong man to hold a 50 pound fish with one hand out like that!
389313,chuckymcd,2009-10-02 14:29:00,144,"nice fish!!! i would not mind catching a ski, well maybe one day"
389317,kemper,2009-10-02 14:32:00,2232,"right, and that 16"" bass I caught last week was a 10 pounder."
389319,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-02 14:37:00,1022,For a second I thought it was 60lbs
389320,GBW,2009-10-02 14:37:00,8460,"kemper's bass goes with my 9"" - 6LB perch..."
389321,anders,2009-10-02 14:38:00,1168,hmmmmmmm   Nice fish indeed......50lbs.....
389322,Greencoachdog,2009-10-02 14:39:00,8163,"50"" and 52#'s with a 5'-4"" man holding it... the pic doesn't do that fish justice eh...."
389324,mbosh1980,2009-10-02 14:46:00,349,"I thought the camera was supposed to add 10 lbs? I can only think that his scale had an old, weak spring in it. Good on him for the release though."
389334,Lunker777,2009-10-02 15:02:00,866,"This is pretty old news.  The guy is a joke, he called the CBC and the local news paper about his amazing CATCH !!! It even said in the article that he release the fish "" Bob Izumi style, gently moving the fish forwards and backwards in the water"" !!!!! IDIOT !!!!! He looks like an idiot holding his 20# fish with the cool thumbs up ! hahahah  I took a post off a local board ( bassheven.com) ... scroll down the page a bit and you will see a comparison and a pretty funny story hahahah  http://www.basshavencanada.com/swamp/viewthread.php?tid=9195"
389336,craigdritchie,2009-10-02 15:06:00,1586,Pretty sure it has to be a typo ..... 52 lbs should actually be 25 lbs.  No one in their right mind would believe that fish is 52 lbs. Not even if it had lead teeth.
389339,Lunker777,2009-10-02 15:10:00,866,  I would agree with you on the typo... but the fact the guy called TWO different news sources.(CBC & The Chatham Daily News ) Both of which had the claim of a 50# fish..... I don't think its a typo !
389350,BITEME,2009-10-02 15:24:00,1968,Thats the biggest fish Ive ever seen
389358,bucktail,2009-10-02 15:43:00,1857,Thats awesome!!!!!!!!  LMAO
389368,OhioFisherman,2009-10-02 16:12:00,6623,"dude is 64 inches tall, muskie, just guessing is 52 inches or so? now idea of how much one that length usually weighs. Nice fish for sure and a congrats on live release! Just a guess under 50 lbs by a pretty fair margin?"
389372,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-02 16:17:00,2038,All fish look Giant in size when being held up by a Leprechaun......
389374,Lunker777,2009-10-02 16:21:00,866,hahahah
389375,kickingfrog,2009-10-02 16:22:00,8333,The guy caught a nice fish. The way it has been reported is an embarrassment.  The CBC National News put it on their broadcast about 2 weeks ago. I watched the whole show because Peter Mansbridge keep baiting me with this big fish story. Last few minutes before the weather and this was the story.  I just shook me head and went to bed.
389376,Lunker777,2009-10-02 16:23:00,866,"For those that haven't clicked the link in my other post.... here is a comparison between a 53lbs fish caught in lake erie, and the ""50lbs"" fish caught in St.Clair.  "
389377,Terry,2009-10-02 16:24:00,14456,"but it doesn't look big compared to him then you read he is 5'4""...now you know it isn't 36"" long............  but it was as big as any Muskie I caught this year...LOL"
389379,misfish,2009-10-02 16:24:00,29133,I got a laugh from just reading the responce posts. Nice fish nontheless
389380,Terry,2009-10-02 16:26:00,14456,shouldn't you be hunting
389386,bubbles,2009-10-02 16:30:00,591,What a joke......
389388,misfish,2009-10-02 16:33:00,29133, Just got back. Raining.
389392,wuchikubo,2009-10-02 16:49:00,1114, Not allowed to hunt in the rain?
