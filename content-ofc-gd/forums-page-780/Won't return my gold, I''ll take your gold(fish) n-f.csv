BuzzFacebookStumbleUponA Pasadena woman angered when her former common-law husband took back jewelry he'd given her returned the gesture, police said, taking goldfish from his apartment —  then ate them.  The two had argued over jewelry he had given her but then took back, Pasadena Police Department spokesman Vance Mitchell said. When the man refused to return the jewelry, she took seven goldfish from his west Pasadena home in the 1100 block of Queens Road to her apartment, Mitchell said. The man called police.  Officers went to the woman's home to see if they could retrieve the fish.  “She said, ‘They're in there,' and pointed to the kitchen,” Mitchell said.  Finding a plate with four fried fish, officers asked where the others were. The woman answered, “I already ate those,” Mitchell said.  Because the fish were bought when the couple lived together, they were considered community property, he said.  “There was nothing we could do,” Mitchell said. “If he wants to pursue it, it's a civil case.”  "
