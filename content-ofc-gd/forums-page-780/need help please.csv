389788,splashhopper,2009-10-04 03:34:00,2931,"set up an account on www.photobucket.com  real easy.... then upload your pics from your PC  after you have uploaded a pic , scroll over the picture with your mouse and a drop down box will appear.  then scroll your mouse to the BOTTOM of the drop down box where it says  IMG code.... copy that.... then come back to this board.... start you topic.... insert your pic by pasting the one you just copied from the IMG code on Photobuket....  real easy to use after you try it once or twice.  I hope this helps  Looking forward to your report WITH pictures.  Splashhopper"
389791,Kinger,2009-10-04 03:46:00,351,"Another quick way is to upload them to facebook, and then just copy and paste the Image source by right clicking--->copy image source."
389794,fishinguypat,2009-10-04 03:57:00,547,do the same with the above post but from Photobucket.com
389806,redneck666,2009-10-04 05:22:00,563,"okay, i need somone to tell me exactly how to upload these photos onto hear without going through a whole bunch of photobucket stuff please. lol cause my report clearly didnt work....."
389811,Terry,2009-10-04 10:06:00,14456,don't know what you mean if you don't upload them to a place like photobucket you can't get them on your post  l well you could but you would have to resize the pictures and what not  the bucket is by far the easiest way   give us the user name you used on photobucket and we will be able to see the pictures there and help...
389815,laszlo,2009-10-04 11:35:00,487,Below is a link to an OFC post that explains everything in detail.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...p;hl=imageshack  Imageshack is really easy to use. Good Luck.
389823,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 12:52:00,8163,"Have you ever noticed those reports with the itty bitty little pics that you can't even hardly see folks face in... let alone the fish they're holding? Those pics were uploaded from a computer and had to be resized to fit the board requirements for uploaded pics.  Now have you noticed the nice big pics most folks put on the board?... like this:    That's a photobucket pic, and it's free to use photobucket!  They even have an editing feature that enable you to do the famous steelhead/salmon background blur!    Do yourself a favor and get an account!"
389840,Radnine,2009-10-04 14:20:00,1538,"  Uh.....eh? Take some time and get to know your computer. Splash's directions were very good. Slow down take it one step at a time and it will work out. Photobucket can be a little daunting at first (lots happening on the screen), get one of your kids to help you (or a neighbour's kid, or whoever knows their way around a computer). Relax all will be well. Jim PS. No pressure, but this had better be a hell of a report."
389926,redneck666,2009-10-04 20:23:00,563," lol theres not much of a report but theres a little something for every picture, and im just a young lad my self being 16. what sucks is i do have a few photos missing though."
