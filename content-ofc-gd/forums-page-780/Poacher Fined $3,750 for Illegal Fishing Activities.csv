389476,Ron,2009-10-02 21:31:00,1683,"September 23, 2009    A Toronto man has been fined  a total of $3,750 for bass fishing-related  offences.    Robert D.  Alexander pleaded guilty to possessing a quantity of fish that was over the  limit, fishing without a licence and illegally transporting fish.    Court heard  that in July 2009, Alexander was stopped by Ministry of Natural Resources  conservation officers on Trent  River Road, in Trent River, Northumberland County.  An inspection of his fishing gear  revealed a large quantity of skinless fish.  Further investigation showed that  Alexander possessed 56 skinless fillets (the equivalent of 28 fish) that had  been harvested without a fishing licence.  It was determined that the fillets  were all bass.  The possession limit for bass in the area is  six.    Justice  Allison Forestall heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Cobourg, on  September 21, 2009.    Anglers are  reminded that each individual is responsible for being aware of their limit and  fishing within it.    To report a  natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time  or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours.  You can  also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."

389478,misfish,2009-10-02 21:42:00,29133, The math works out.  Nice to see thier still getting the bad guys Ron. Thanks for posting.
389479,Terry,2009-10-02 21:44:00,14456,"nice  but $10,000.00 fine would be better"
389485,uglyfish,2009-10-02 22:06:00,981,  i agree!! they should have really made it hurt him!
389489,Bondar,2009-10-02 22:27:00,817,fishing  liciense should be banned even though he didnt have one for along time plus HEFTY HEFTY FINE Thank you CO's Job well done
389490,BillM,2009-10-02 22:30:00,17367,"Should have taken his truck, his boat and all his tackle..  If he wanted them back he could bid on them at auction."
389492,Greencoachdog,2009-10-02 22:34:00,8163,"I think he should've done some time at the ""crossbar hotel"" as well!... what kind of idiot fishes without a license, let alone poaches without one???"
389495,Canuck2fan,2009-10-02 22:43:00,1444,Fine was too low and they should go back to taking the vehicle and the tackle. So much of this stuff keeps going on because poachers know nothing really drastic will happen to them. So what the guy loses a month's pay big deal....
389498,troutologist,2009-10-02 22:50:00,951,"I would love to see some examples being made in cases like this. This is absolutely flagrant abuse of a resource, no licence on top of it all. $10000 should be the minimum. Who knows how many times a summer this guy does this same thing. Tape barbwire to the book and throw it at him."
389560,johnnyb,2009-10-03 01:56:00,3413,"Good job nailing the punk, CO's    But yeah....would be nice to see the punishment put the hurt on this guy so he either never picks up a rod again, or learns to do it right."
389661,tibbs,2009-10-03 14:40:00,650,"It's great they caught this guy, but i agree that he should be fined way more."
389666,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-03 15:22:00,3761," Dis agree, I have a very good friend that forgot to renew his license and went fishing(forgot about the license) and he got checked for it on that day when he was out in his boat, the CO let him go with a warning.  10'000 is a little much and is obviously not in effect for a reason."
389669,oates,2009-10-03 15:31:00,151,no wonder we have some bad fishing days we don't expect with buddy pulling out dozens of fish from the river!
389675,troutologist,2009-10-03 16:17:00,951,  Dude I think you missed what I was referring to. Simply not having a license is one thing (still no excuse in my mind). But possessing 20 some fish over the limit coupled with no license is basically a scofflaw attitude that deserves harsh punishment.
389678,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-03 16:29:00,3761," O ok, that's what I was hoping for lol."
389679,Terry,2009-10-03 16:37:00,14456,I think everyone else was referring to everything he did not just not having a license
389689,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-03 17:26:00,0,A fine will never stop this type of fool.......
389693,sandmann,2009-10-03 17:42:00,51,Nice to see they caught this jack ass. Not only is the fine to small they should also post his picture.
