389595,siwash,2009-10-03 03:32:00,683," Ya, I tried that route... couldn't find anything that said either way..."
389600,Dara,2009-10-03 03:51:00,3052,"As far as I can remember, Starcraft has always been riveted"
389607,siwash,2009-10-03 04:13:00,683,That's what I thought...
389630,Billy Bob,2009-10-03 12:23:00,5865,I far as I know Starcraft is only riveted and so is Sylvan boats which is basically a Starcraft.
389645,SlowPoke,2009-10-03 13:21:00,2984,I don't think Starcraft ever produced a welded boat under the Starcraft name but I believe Monark is a division of Starcraft and has a nice line of welded models to choose from dating back at least a few years.
389653,craigdritchie,2009-10-03 13:54:00,1586,"Starcraft, Smokercraft and Sylvan are the same company, and all three boats are manufactured at the same facility in New Paris, Indiana. They have made both riveted and welded aluminum boats for a long time. I do not know exactly when they started selling Starcraft welded boats, but the 1970s could be possible.  Most of their welded boats are sold in the US, as Starcraft and/or Starweld. Starcraft does not sell its welded boats in Canada, which is why most people here don't know they even exist. However, welded boats made by Starcraft are sold here under other well-known brand names, and have been for years. They're very good boats."
