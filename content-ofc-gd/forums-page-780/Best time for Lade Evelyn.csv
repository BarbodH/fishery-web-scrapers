However, I'm seeking advice on whether the fishing would be better in June, July, August or September. If you had a choice, which month would be the best in your opinion? Thanks Paul"

Sucker Gut doesn't get very deep, so the fish probably scatter once the temps go up.  1st week of June would be prime IMO.  You thinking of roughing it or staying at a lodge?  If you're opting for the latter, a day spent with a guide will make a world of difference.  Good luck!  HD"
