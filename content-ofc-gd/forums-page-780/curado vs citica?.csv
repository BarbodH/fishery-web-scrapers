389841,MSBruno,2009-10-04 14:23:00,369,"I was looking to pick up a curado, but the citica is much more affordable.  Any real world experiences with both?  I hear nothing but amazing things about the curado and was wondering if I can get the technology in a more aoffrdable package.  Thanks in advance, Mark"
389844,timmeh,2009-10-04 14:41:00,609,I recently had the same decision. I found a real good sale on a citica so I went with that. I've have had no problems whatsoever with the citica. It's my first baitcaster so I was worried about birdsnests but didn't have much of a problem with that at all. I can't directly compare with the curado though.
389847,[emailÂ protected],2009-10-04 14:49:00,290,They are both good. I almost bought a curado but the Quantum code was on sale for an amazing price.
389848,highdrifter,2009-10-04 14:50:00,2534,They're both entry level.  Get a Calcutta.
389850,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-10-04 15:06:00,53,"  Have em both, love em both! Curado 300E and Calcutta CTE 200 GT. Shimano baitcasters all the way."
389855,fishindude,2009-10-04 15:42:00,220,Convinced me  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanocitica200e.html  Now you decide
389858,uglyfish,2009-10-04 15:58:00,981,"i have 2 citicas E's great reels for the price. not as good as casting lighter baits as the curado, but still very nice reels"
389859,tdotfisherman,2009-10-04 15:59:00,317,"My buddy just bought a Citica this spring, and I've had a chance to use it here and there. I'm very impressed with it.. its extremely light, but also very strong. I'd say its best feature is its idiot proof backlash/birdsnest feature.. its almost impossible to muck up a cast, which is very good for beginning baitcast users.."
389862,scugpg,2009-10-04 16:15:00,1373,I have a citica it works great for me. I haven't played with the brake or anything and its really tough to backlash.

389873,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-04 16:58:00,2038,Just buy one of each...  The citica is.....
389875,HTHM,2009-10-04 17:02:00,4082,"I have one of each, and love em both!"
389905,Garry2Rs,2009-10-04 18:58:00,1425,"The Curado is a fine reel.  It has been the top choice of many non-sponsored tournament guys for the last 10 years and it has gotten better with each new generation. The Citica isn't in the same league, but at half the price it's okay. The Code is a great value for the casual fisherman, but with it's chrome plated plastic parts I don't think it's meant for heavy use... Since Hometown Handyman has already posted, let me put it this way, for me a $20.00  Black and Decker drill is fine...it makes holes.  For a him, a guy who uses his drill three or more days a week year round, it wouldn't last...That's what we're talking about here.  The buyer need to make a choice based on his/her personal wants and needs."
390059,msp,2009-10-04 23:59:00,1336,Entry level ????Curado is way better than the Calcutta
390061,BillM,2009-10-05 00:11:00,17367,I used a Citica for a good 2 years before upgrading to a Calais..  Great reel for the price.
390062,highdrifter,2009-10-05 00:11:00,2534," Gear ratio is faster on my curado, but the calcutta has more torke I find.  Okay okay, get the Curado!!"
390068,SlowPoke,2009-10-05 00:15:00,2984,"  Since we're comparing apples to oranges, I say get a Trinidad."
390080,pike slayer,2009-10-05 00:32:00,1177,"i just picked up the citica and used it for the first time this weekend and so far i love it. i pulled in a number of nice pike with it, the largest weighing in at 9lbs! i havent tried the curado so i cant say anything on that."
