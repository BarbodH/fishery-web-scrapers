(august/september)   thanks,  JP"

388470,troutologist,2009-09-30 04:05:00,951,Nice place for a walk in the evening on the old whitefish pier. Almost always people fishing there. They would be the best ones to ask.
388615,redneck666,2009-09-30 18:04:00,563,"lol believe me, i've tried!"
388628,Crazyhook,2009-09-30 18:37:00,1154,Hey I did the walk a few weeks ago and trust me its a long walk...  well worth it though!
388677,BrownTown,2009-09-30 21:12:00,103,"I was gonna say the same thing, shouldn't you be posting pics of how hard your slamming them there? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeettttt mannnnnnnnnnnnnn!"
388688,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 21:46:00,0,"most anglers find these types of questions out not by asking, but by doing.  the reason i know where and when to be for certain fish has nothing to do with asking people and everything to do with countless hours i've spent fishing.  nobody is going to trade their hard work for your success. put in your time."
389751,redneck666,2009-10-04 01:03:00,563,"haha, i beg to differ Dr.s."
389764,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-04 02:20:00,0,then why aren't you posting reports of all the fish you're catching?
389772,redneck666,2009-10-04 02:52:00,563,"well.... i would but i havent yet..... lol i havent really thought much about but i might just post the pics and maybe just a paragraph of writing... i dunno speaking of that, im gunna upload photos to my computer right now"
