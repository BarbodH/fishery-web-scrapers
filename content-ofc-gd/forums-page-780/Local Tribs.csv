389565,ehg,2009-10-03 02:01:00,2666,"So it seems that fishing for those species is permitted up to HWY 2 as opposed to CNR bridge south only, until Dec.31. That seems new to me and is a lot of open water especially on Duffins and Oshawa. When they changed the zoning i guess this changed as well"
389571,CLofchik,2009-10-03 02:18:00,854, It's been open to Hwy. 2 in the fall for almost twenty years.
389575,ehg,2009-10-03 02:29:00,2666,"Really, i did not know that. Never tried fishing these areas always stayed in the estuary parts later in the year anyways. Think that most people are still under the impression that it is CNR bridge south only as of Sept 30."
389708,GBW,2009-10-03 19:08:00,8460,"Dave, the good news is you now know and have a bit more room to fish and so does everyone else.  cheers"
389807,camillj,2009-10-04 05:29:00,1988,  I was fishin up there christmas eve ... at least 30 years ago ... has always been closed christmas day
388989,tizfun,2009-10-01 15:55:00,292,"Ok.  I have a question for you all... I drove by Duffins Creek in Ajax yesterday and it was just packed in with fish.  Called a friend to let him know and he wants to fish it later today or tomorrow..   Now, I explained that the close of the season was yesterday but he says it's only for rainbow/browns and not Salmon...   Is he right ??   Can we still fish for them ??  If so, you may want to have a look out that way... I couldn't count the number of fish I saw yesterday..  Tiz"
388998,Fisherman,2009-10-01 16:13:00,7201,"Maybe your ""friend"" should read the ""exceptions to the rules"" part for Zone 17, then he too will be certain and not relying on ""opinions""."
389005,GBW,2009-10-01 16:41:00,8460,might want to give page 2 a look... http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001336.pdf
389010,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-01 16:51:00,1107,just to state the obvious no you can't fish it salmon closes the same day as trout in that zone and  I could not find any extended season for duffins.
389013,BillM,2009-10-01 16:57:00,17367,"  Dude, read page 4."
389017,drwxr,2009-10-01 17:12:00,453,  ssshhhhh!!!!
389019,BillM,2009-10-01 17:14:00,17367,Fixed!   lol
389022,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-01 17:24:00,1107,I just re-read all of zone 17 and still don't see what your talking about duffins isn't named in any exeptions to the rule am i blind ? just put it up so i can see what your talking about and there are only 3 pages in the PDF file .
389023,GBW,2009-10-01 17:27:00,8460,"duffins is considered ""Durham"" so....

389029,GBW,2009-10-01 17:33:00,8460,"Sorry, but there is a secret on page 4.  it happens. zoom in on the map on page 1.  see the 2 rivers that split by the word ""Pickering"" that is Duffins."
389030,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-01 17:33:00,1107,and they wonder why people mis-understand the regs they couldn't just name the rivers in the area to be clear I'm a L.Erie guy so I don't know that area at all and now I know thanks and sorry for the confusion .
389031,GBW,2009-10-01 17:35:00,8460,"not to worry, good call to ask.  I keep a print out of zone 16 and 17 in my car, just in case I see a spot I want to fish."
389032,canadadude,2009-10-01 17:37:00,769,and open all year from the southery limit of the C.N.R to Lake Ontario
389035,tizfun,2009-10-01 17:42:00,292,"Okay, so we're clear on that.. but this spot is north of the CNR tracks and well north of Hwy 401 & Hwy 2.. We're fished for them @ Wilmont Creek years ago and north of the CNR bridge...   Ah well, just the thought of hooking into one would have been nice...  Thanks to all for their input... Always Always is this board a great place to ask..  TC Tiz"
389206,sandman007,2009-10-02 01:22:00,1,Does Anyone Know the rules regarding fishing from the liquor store to the river mouth in Port Hope?
389207,BillM,2009-10-02 01:25:00,17367, Read the regs.
389242,GBW,2009-10-02 03:02:00,8460,"Ya fishing for Lakeport, Laker or a fish?"
389245,Dara,2009-10-02 03:06:00,3052,Go fish for them...by the sounds of all these other threads there ain't no game wardens around anyway...so why worry
389276,DMASSE,2009-10-02 11:40:00,420,"So your saying  Other than the Ganny, you can fish Wilmont, Bowmanville, Oshawa and Duffins from Hwy 2 south...All rivers in Durham  You might want to clairify the book.....   Over the past years  Ganny cnr south,   Wilmont Cnr South,  Bowmanville HWY 2 South, Oshawa CNR south and Duffins  Cnr South ,  Maybe its changed but I am not sure....  Please make sure as Mitch  (CO) is very active right now looking for people in closed areas...  Good Luck  Dave  Regional Municipality of Durham - all waters between Hwy. 2 and the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-of-way  Becarefull of the AND,   its river by river access"
389303,Fisherman,2009-10-02 14:10:00,7201,"Rather than posting what used to be, read the current regs: ADDITIONAL ZONE 17 FISHING OPPORTUNITIES Rainbow Trout, Brown Trout and Pacific Salmon Extended Fall Season (4th Sat. in April to Dec. 31) Northumberland County - all waters downstream of Hwy. 2, except the Ganaraska River which may only be fished downstream of the south side of the C.P.R. bridge Regional Municipality of Durham - all waters between Hwy. 2 and the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-of-way Rainbow Trout, Brown Trout and Pacific Salmon Open all year Cobourg Brook (Cobourg Creek/Factory Creek) – between the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-ofway and Lake Ontario Gages Creek - between the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-of-way and Lake Ontario Ganaraska River - between the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-of-way and Lake Ontario Regional Municipality of Durham - all waters lying between the southerly limit of the C.N.R. right-of-way and Lake Ontario"
389307,GBW,2009-10-02 14:16:00,8460,"Yes Dave, all waters is correct as long as you are South of HWY 2 for the rest of 2009. do you want to email Mitch or should I to make sure on the ""AND"" portion?  To me, if you are standing on HWY 2 and you want to fish you have to be on the South side of the rd and that's about it.  Then in the new year you must be South of the CNR tracks.  But they will have a new 2010-2011 book out so that may change..."
389389,MJL,2009-10-02 16:34:00,2427," DMASSE,  I’m a little confused about the point you’re trying to get across.  The year round sections for ALL durham region rivers (Ganny is part of Northumberland county) is the southern edge of the CNR bridge down to Lake Ontario (You have Bowmanville listed at hwy 2 south which is incorrect if you are referring to that as the year round section).  The CNR bridge has always been the year round boundary for as long as I can remember fishing Durham region.  There however exists an extended season for pacific salmon, brown trout and rainbow trout post Sept 30 to Dec 31 from the south side of highway 2 down to Lake Ontario for all rivers in Durham – Come January 1st 2010, you must fish all rivers in Durham region south of the CNR bridge till the trout season opener.  The AND that you are referring to represents the transition point at which the year round section and the extended season section meet (that’s all)."
389546,DMASSE,2009-10-03 01:25:00,420,"No Sorry my misconception was that certain rivers had different access this time of year,  Like Wilmont, I was under the impression that it is closed past the CNR bridge, and its not,  its HWY 2            I know for sure that Bowmanville is open to HWY 2....and Oshawa is CNR But Hwy 2 and CNR are 50 ft apart...  I email Mitch and Wil Wagmen and got the correct info.......    I have been fishing these rivers for 15+ years and didnt know Wilmont was HWY 2 after Sept LOL  Anyway all I was saying be sure because I know Mitch is out looking for poachers.  Dave"
