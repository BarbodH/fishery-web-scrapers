389642,ccmtcanada,2009-10-03 13:00:00,7971,"We have a 41 lb thrust Motorguide remote control trolling motor on our boat (Modeal 370RF)...and the wireless foot pedal is sometimes hard to operate.  We had heard there was a ""universal"" hand held key fob remote control and we were intrigued, so we went and got one.  Problem is, we cant seem to get it to work.  The instructions say to plug in the trolling motor so it has power, then push and hold the + and - buttons on the key fob.  We should hear a long beep to confirm that the trolling motor receiver has 'registered' the new remote.  Thing is, we've never heard the trolling motor ever make any sound before...and doing these steps was no different.  We know it's not registered as the remote does nothing to operate the motor.  We did replace the battery in the remote...I wish it had an LED light to show that when you press a button it was actually working.  If anyone has any ideas out there please let me know!  Thanks.  Here's a picture of the remote...  "

389648,Terry,2009-10-03 13:35:00,14456,the motor should beep every single annoying time you push any button on the remotes and the beep should drive you crazy..well it drives me crazy   unplug the motor for half a minute and try again  I would not try erasing the memory or you foot petal may not work too.....
389657,Joey,2009-10-03 14:08:00,9122,"We had this exact same issue Cliff.  I bought that remote from LeBaron but they could not find the box or instructions for it.  I ended up calling Motorguide and he told me this.  He said to unplug the trolling motor, but not just unplug, actually take away all power, ie:  disconnect from the battery.  Then connect back to the battery, plug back in the trolling motor and you have a 10 second window.  Count to 3, then push the + and - together at the same time.  He said it would do the long beep, but it did not, but it worked after that anyhow.  I think the ticket was the disconnection from the battery that finally got it to work.  Good luck, hope it works for you.  Joey"
389658,ccmtcanada,2009-10-03 14:14:00,7971,"Thanks Joey...will give that a shot before we return it.  But I think we are out of luck. Just got off the phone with a motorguide repair center...and they said that it wont work with out...it's too old.  So much for ""Works with all Motorguide remote control trolling motors"""
389736,Greencoachdog,2009-10-03 23:37:00,8163,"Hey Cliff, I believe the Motorguide trolling motor you have is the Lazer and is controlled by an infrared beam... while the newer models are radio frequency controlled.  I wish I would've known you were going to buy that key fob and I'd have told you, I thought you had gotten a new trolling motor.  Can you get your money back for the fob? If not PM me I could prolly use a spare..."
