Can you amagin the first thought of a cop if I got pulled over.Whats in the bag mister?Then he takes a second look.LOL  Seriously though,it,s works great. I put a fresh layer of ceder branches on the bottom of my hunting bag,then put my suit and gear in the bag,then add more on top. I refresh it once a week. No artificial spaying or washing crap. Hope it helps ya out.  "
