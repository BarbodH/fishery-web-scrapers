256742,tizfun,2008-10-09 01:26:00,292,"Fished Pigeon today and it was the best ever.. Total of 22 walleye and 3 smallies and a 11 lbs Muskey while jigging for walleye.. We were on the water @ 8:30am and I had 3 walleye boated within the first 10 mins of fishing.. Nothing really big but kept 3 of the biggest for dinner.. Fish were constant most of the day, but around 3:00pm when the rain started, they just shut down..  When I hooked into the Muskey, I thought and hoped I had a pig of a Walleye on.. Hooked it on the stinger hook off my jig using 8 lbs mono.. Great battle !!!!! I'll post a pic of the Muskey as soon as my bud sends it too me..  I'll be back on Sunday for another try at some eyes... and a good troll for the big girls..  Tiz  "
