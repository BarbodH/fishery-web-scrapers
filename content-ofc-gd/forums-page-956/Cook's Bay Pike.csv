256114,trophypikehunter,2008-10-07 09:27:00,89,"I've been catching them in 3 to 4 ft of water but anywhere in the bay will produce try just north of Crate's marina the next little inlet, it was the old Keiffer's marina that area is good, I've been using spinner baits my biggest landed in the last few weeks out there was a 35 incher but lost one well over that.. This passed weekend was the first time in weeks I got skunked.....Good luck"
256119,Cudz,2008-10-07 10:36:00,2652,Thanks guys.  I was actually going to fish in that depth but I wasn't sure if they had moved off to deeper water.
256145,Governator,2008-10-07 13:22:00,879,"We fished the southwest side all day saturday and had nothing to show for it.  Was pretty depressing, cold, windy, 6-7hrs on the water with just 1 jumbo perch for my efforts - caught while trolling a spinnerbait."
256186,steverowbotham,2008-10-07 15:50:00,1800,You can get good numbers in 4-8 feet.  If you want size ... go 10-20 feet
256214,Governator,2008-10-07 17:42:00,879,"What are you guys using at this time of year for trolling for pike in cooks bay?  Large spinnerbaits, crankbaits?"

256218,tinbanger,2008-10-07 17:50:00,1028,"was out this morning for a few hours , not a thing to show for it except working on my tan! Several boats around and all seemed quiet .  should have gone with plan b   TB"
256237,Governator,2008-10-07 19:21:00,879,Anyone use Creek Chub lures for pike trolling?  They look huge and wouldn't mind trying them out.   
256245,trophypikehunter,2008-10-07 20:09:00,89,"I have a creek chub from 1918 so I wont dare use that but I do use a white spinner bait tipped with a Mr.twisty or the biggest johnson silver minnow,  coopper colour.. I'm heading out now so will post with the picture of my trophy if she decides to show up tonite......"
256251,tinbanger,2008-10-07 20:32:00,1028,The tipped spinner bait is a fav of mine too  good luck on the water tonight TPH it will be a beautiful night on the water .   tb
256448,Rich,2008-10-08 15:11:00,3927,"This time of year, bigger is better. Creek chubs are killers!"
256459,Governator,2008-10-08 15:43:00,879,"I picked up a big mepps 5 aglias (dressed), 5 1/2"" husky jerk and a couple 3/4 oz spinner baits.  To be honest I've never tried an inline spinner, anxious to give the mepps a whirl."
