256258,Whitemikeca,2008-10-07 21:00:00,138,"Here are some pics from my last two fishing outings.  I usually go almost every weekend but due to work and all the rain we have gotten this summer,  there was a 7 week span between these outings!  I nearly lost my sanity!  The first one was a 45.5 incher I caught in August.  He was long but a little lean for his size.    This past weekend I went out with my buddy Dan to try and finally pop his muskie cherry.  He has been out muskie fishing with me many times but he never manages to catch one...until now.    Then 5 mins later....this guy put up a great fight!  He pulled drag on my Calcutta TE 300, he jumped 3 times and then made a run under the boat.  Luckily he was hooked really well.    All 3 of these fish were caught trolling believers and all three were caught within a couple hundred yards of each other.  Unfortunately for team 8 I keep forgetting to bring my team 8 sign!  I am hoping the weather holds up until monday so I get out there again."
