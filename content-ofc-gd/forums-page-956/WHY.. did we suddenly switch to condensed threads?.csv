257068,danc,2008-10-10 00:39:00,4677,It's because you're back Wayne and we we have to preserve our bandwidth because of that.  Actually I think that it's just a setting that you've accidentally clicked on. I'm sure someone will explain it to you.
257069,irishfield,2008-10-10 00:41:00,26272,Probably... but I don't know what !
257071,lew,2008-10-10 00:44:00,12767,"Wayne, I think it's something you need to click in ""options"" at the top right of your screen, but darned if I remember what"
257072,irishfield,2008-10-10 00:47:00,26272,Thanks Lew.. back to normal.. not sure how I hit that!
