So i called Loomis (Shimano Canada) warranty dept. recently and the lady told me it would cost $74. + tax no questions asked and i dont have to send nothing until i get my new rod, and all they want is about the bottom 2 to 3Ft with the model #. While the new one is here, a 13Ft. STFR1601S Pretty cool. Must respect!!!!"
