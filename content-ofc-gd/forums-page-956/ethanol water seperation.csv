I did some looking around and this comment I found sums up all of the infomation, that I thought was based on any kind of real study, showed. ""The EPA produced a report on the chances of phase separation in oxygenated fuels. If the only source of water is from moisture in the air, it is highly unlikely to have it happen due to the long period of time required.  ""For example, at a constant temperature of 100 degrees F and relative humidity of 100%, it would take well over 200 days to saturate one gallon of gasoline in an open gasoline can (assuming the only source of water is water vapor from the air). Water absorption from the air is far slower at lower temperatures and humidities. (At a temperature of 70 degrees and relative humidity of 70%, it would take over two years to saturate one gallon of conventional gasoline in the same gasoline can.) Again, oxygenated gasolines can hold more water than conventional gasoline, and would therefore take much longer to saturate with water.""""  Personally I have had E10 gas that sat for 6 months that did not seem to have a problem. I think a lot is blamed on E10 that is unfounded in any scientific testing."
