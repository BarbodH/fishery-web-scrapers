We're staying from the 16th-19th and looking to bring in some pike during the trip.  Does anyone have any tips on fishing the south end of joseph or ada lake?  Cheers Gov  "
256559,irishfield,2008-10-08 19:49:00,26272,With any lake I don't know... I'd start with a #5 Mepps (or similar) bucktail/spinner. Black/Red... black/purple..
256562,Governator,2008-10-08 19:51:00,879,  Just picked up one of those yesterday... #5 mepps aglia bucktail spinner with red/black dressing heh

Be sure to bring your camera...even if you don't catch fish, the scenery will be fantastic up there this time of year...good luck!"
