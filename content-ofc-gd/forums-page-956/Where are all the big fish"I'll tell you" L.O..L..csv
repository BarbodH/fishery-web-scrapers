257000,johnnyb,2008-10-09 21:35:00,3413,"nice! My buddy went to a lodge up there a couple times...he doesn't take advice well though, so not listening to the lodge owner's advice had him missing out on the sort of stuff you've showed us.  Speaking of ice-fishing...is it a busy lake in the winter?"
257004,Governator,2008-10-09 21:55:00,879,  I thought only the beer store was busy in the winter.
257019,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-09 22:44:00,2050,"hahaha saweeeeeet - I fished the crap out of that lake growing up.  My uncle had a cottage on the lake which eventually turned into his house and I spent nearly every weekend there as a kid.  Man I miss fishing that deep cold, rocky lake.  Some AWESOME smallie fishing in there if you know where and how to get'em.....  It's actually the only lake I ever ice-fished growing up as a kid.  We used to get eater lakers through the ice in 100+ FOW and by the time you got them to the surface they were bloated and dead as a door knob.  Got some big ling through the ice to.  fond memoirs man..... thanks for the pix"

257117,Canuck,2008-10-10 02:07:00,491,Nice fish.  I lived in Garson from 1973 to 1981.  Graduated from GFSS in 1980. We used to go to the north river feeding into Wahnapitae in the spring for walleye.  I used to like to fish the kettle lakes near skead and the airport area for brookies.  I heard Ramsay is actually not a bad fishery now too even tho its right n the city.
