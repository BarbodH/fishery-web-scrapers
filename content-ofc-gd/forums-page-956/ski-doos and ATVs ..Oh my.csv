251556,Terry,2008-09-21 17:16:00,14456,"some days things are just all screwed up and there is nothing you can do about it..  I had my ATV stolen some time ago and was offered no where near enough money from the insurance company to replace it with anything near that I lost  so I had put off settling with them for months.one, hoping to get more money and two, hoping my ATV would be returned undamaged.. well I gave up and took the money knowing I would not be buying an ATV any time soon  decided to get a ski-doo so I could still go fishing in the winter(this is where the fishing part of the post will happen some day but not  too soon)  well asked lots of questions looked at lots of machines lots with no ownerships...wonder how that happens.........  found one I liked checked it out and now it is mine 2004 ski-doo legend 500 liquid cool 2 up and a great deal from what I can see from looking around  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3351.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3351.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>     a thing of beauty ..2,700km  I was a happy camper          . . . . . . . .   for 5 minutes        I walk in the do and tell my wife to come look at the new machine and she tells me she took a message on the phone          they found my ATV             how the hell can things work out like that         I guess I will check it out and see what condition it is in and if it's worth buying back from the insurance company     dang...I only had to wait one more day and I would still have all the money from the ATV....oh well life is never dull    so how is your weekend going  I did catch 2 muskie on friday....LOL"
251560,jwl,2008-09-21 17:24:00,1056,"wow go figure eh???, you better go out and buy a couple lottery tickets now man cuz the chances of that are 1 in a million for sure"
251578,Dabluz,2008-09-21 18:48:00,701,It would be interesting to know how much the insurance company wants for your ATV.  Keep us posted.
251583,Bernie,2008-09-21 19:34:00,3190,"An upside to it Terry is it's a great snowmachine. Great ride, lots of power and dependable. Exactly what I would like as well."
251614,fishindevil,2008-09-21 22:43:00,6254,"Geez,terry you have just about the same kind of luck as i do man !!!!....i had my wheels stolen in march too,so i know how you feel,anyways nice snow machine for sure,looks like it will do the job for sure,i hope all goes well with the insurance company !!!! keeps us informed bud...."
251703,Joey,2008-09-22 03:20:00,9122,"Wow, that's either good luck or bad luck, I'm not quite sure Terry  Well, at least you'll have an easier time getting over the pressure crack with the sled  Congrats on the muskies bud.  Joey"
251708,Dabluz,2008-09-22 03:55:00,701,"If you plan to do any amount of snowmobiling ""off trail"", you will be very disappointed with that machine."
251902,Terry,2008-09-22 21:17:00,14456,well dang that's not what I wanted to hear  others said it would do great and it's the machine of choice on simcoe   dang...oh well it's up for sale..I will find the perfect machine   LOL
251912,Dano,2008-09-22 22:47:00,719,.
251913,Dano,2008-09-22 22:48:00,719,"Man, aint that just the luck huh? Good luck on the 4 wheeler thing, what a mess.  However, that new sled does look like a sweet ride. Congrats Terry."
251979,skeeter,2008-09-23 01:36:00,1907,why would he be disappointed??
251992,Dabluz,2008-09-23 02:16:00,701,"All snowmobiles are great choices.  All have their advantages and disadvantages.  Since this is a fishing site, I surmised that Terry would be using his machine for ice fishing in the winter.  Here in the Saguenay region of Quebec, the average is 2 snowmobiles per household.  Most have machines that are either much lighter for one-up riding or longer wider machines for deep snow.  However, the fishermen almost all have machines with wider and longer tracks.  Most use machines with tracks 144 inches long and 20 inches wide.  I have used Summits and Grand Touring and these machines were not good in deep soft snow.  My old 1988 Safari with 144 inch X 16.5 inch track (no electric start and no reverse) and 503 air cooled engine does better in deep snow.  The 2004 Skidoo Legend 500 liquid cooled weighs 550 lbs (quite heavy).  The track is 136 X 15 inches (not bad but could be better)  However, if the snow does not accumulate on lake Simcoe and the warmer temperatures help make the snow more compact, a Legend or a Grand Touring may be great.  I don't know because I have never snowmobiled in that area.  However, machines like the Legend or the Grand Touring etc are about the best you can get for 2 passenger riding on snowmobile trails."
252024,carll2,2008-09-23 05:32:00,443,"im sure youll be good with that legend 500....she looks very clean indeed,  if only my new yamaha could show up soon at the dealer so i can sleep with it every night lol"
252063,misfish,2008-09-23 13:18:00,29133,"2 musky eh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,no pic,s no believe. Glad to hear they found yer machine Terry. Did they say how they came apon it?"
252067,glen,2008-09-23 13:33:00,2641,They were not going to give you much for the ATV.   Then it should cost you the same to get it back.  Let us know what happens Terry.
252173,codered,2008-09-23 21:32:00,123,Im looking for a sled if you want to get rid of her let me know your price...looks like a good sled
252178,Terry,2008-09-23 21:49:00,14456,thank.... I think I will give her a try when the snow/ice comes not that I am hoping for early ice up..still lots of open water fishing to do    2 pictures of muskie in the muskie post.....non-believer
256819,ravinerat,2008-10-09 11:20:00,64,"Terry that sled is fine for Simcoe. I've used my Grand Touring 500 with a 136"" track for years out there and never had a problem with snow or slush. I take my sled off trail many time accessing back lakes and it's all how you drive it. If you get stuck there are numerous ways to get it unstuck and you need to learn these if you solo at all. There is always a better sled but there is nothing wrong with the Legend line up. You'll pull a fish trap just find and it's a comfy sled.  I bought a used 2005 GTX 500 last March and was doing lots of solo off trail running just fine. If you ever want to head out on the lake and practice some stuff drop me a line. Congrats on your new addition.  PS. find a better way to attach that sled to your trailer ro you'll be doing another insurance claim.   RR"
256832,cisco,2008-10-09 12:39:00,597,I remember when you first got the ATV and you were late getting to a m and g cuz it got gogged down a buncha times in slush.  That happened several times I'm sure.  NOW you have a critter that will help avoid all that plus keep you warmer since you're not as exposed to the elements.  Congrats on a fine sled Terry! It's the way ta go on Simcoe!
