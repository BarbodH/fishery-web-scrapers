256206,rock34,2008-10-07 17:16:00,215,"If you were to go river fishing on Thanksgiving weekend, anywhere in Southern Ontario.....where would you go?"
256216,tonyb,2008-10-07 17:44:00,1637,"Not in Southern Ontario, I would cross the border into NY and fish one of the highly productive rivers there.  The runs are so large you'll be ruined for river fishing in Ontario forever...10, 20, 30 fish days are COMMON."
256221,solopaddler,2008-10-07 18:11:00,8605,"Pretty much what Tony said, except if the Notty or 'Geen has decent vis they'd both be good bets."
256225,dizzidevil,2008-10-07 18:24:00,63,I would do a drive to Port Albert.
256229,blaque,2008-10-07 18:44:00,2419,I heard all the stateside fish are going to be runnin the north shores of Erie this year. Strange occurance for sure
256234,kemper,2008-10-07 19:12:00,2232,"Find a trib and fish it, any trib you fish is spring will probably have some numbers in it. I know it isnt quite like fishing stateside but hey sometimes that is possible and sometimes it isnt. There is some great fishing to be had on the eastern tribs if you are looking for quality over quantity"
256239,cplummer,2008-10-07 19:29:00,165,I would say lake huron tribs...  the niagara still a tad slow..
256276,Canuck2fan,2008-10-07 22:37:00,1444, Lake Huron tribs are a waste of time right now.... But if you are into watching 40 other people get skunked too go for it.
256363,Rich,2008-10-08 02:21:00,3927,I'd go out in the boat and avoid the crowds.
256491,rock34,2008-10-08 16:59:00,215,I wish I could go to the US and fish this weekend.  Really I am looking to take my two young brothers out and they are just starting to float fish this fall so I would like them to actually see a fish or two and possibly avoid the crowds of a place like the credit.  We are leaveing from Waterloo but have no issues driving anywhere really.  Any tips?
256727,hurraylien,2008-10-09 01:11:00,95,i am renting a cottage in port albert this weekend its a crap shoot for there water is still low but i was at the saugeen monday and saw a fair number of rainbows caught and didnt see one salmon at dennys dam so might have to go there saw one guy nail about 6 fish in a row he said he was on 20.have to break this skunk run
256782,Bojangles,2008-10-09 03:11:00,46,""" In the U - S of A. ""  "
256904,blaque,2008-10-09 15:52:00,2419, Wasnt it U-S-And-A lol
256908,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-09 16:07:00,10439,I would hide in the bushes outside Solo Paddlers house and follow him.
256938,buckster,2008-10-09 17:45:00,530,  hope there is room for me in those bushes too lol
256940,Marko,2008-10-09 17:49:00,854,Years of experience and lots of early mornings and late nights plus lots of wading and persistance and we might be able to catch as many fish  .
