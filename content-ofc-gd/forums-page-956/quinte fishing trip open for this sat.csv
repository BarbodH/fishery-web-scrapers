I live in between the Soo and Sudbury on the north channel of Lake Huron and our eyes don't grow that big!  I hope to talk a few of the boys into a road trip your way!  Good luck Saturday!   I'll be on the North Channel at the mouth of the Spanish River.....I won't dare compare our reports! lol.  You know what they say though....""A great day on the water....""  I hope to fish the BOQ soon! Cheers!"
