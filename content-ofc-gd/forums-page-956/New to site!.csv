I've used other fishing forums, but this one is my first choice now. Well I'm going to Pigeon Lake this week and wondering if any one can give some hints, or even upload a map that i could go by? I'm searching for my first muskie, so than i can change my profile picture. LOL! Some help would be great!"

256346,dizzidevil,2008-10-08 01:40:00,63,does any one have a map of the lake that they can upload of the lake with good muskie spots to go to?
256421,Rich,2008-10-08 13:43:00,3927,Good luck on getting your first. Fish shallow with those bucktails and you should be rewarded eventually. Don't skimp on speed either.. crank em as fast as you can.  Maybe this map will help you out.  http://fish-hawk.net/hawktalk/viewtopic.php?t=130
