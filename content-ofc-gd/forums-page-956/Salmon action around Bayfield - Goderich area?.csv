247953,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-09 15:06:00,0,"One fishing buddy of mine got sick of lake-o tribs and would like to check out Lake-Eric (Bayfield, Goderich area) for salmon actions  Can anyone let me know how it is now (wonder if it is too early enough though lake-o started already)  Thanks in advance"
247954,Marko,2008-09-09 15:11:00,854,"I think its still to early for Goderich, If i remember correctly they run much later then lake O salmon."
247962,Spiel,2008-09-09 15:44:00,9065,"....I believe you mean Bayfield and both Bayfield and Goderich would be a further drive than Lake Erie since they are on Lake Huron. As to the question bout salmon runs at either, I know nothing."
247971,Paully,2008-09-09 16:02:00,712,i'll be fishin sauble river in 3 weeks time... Last year they were in full force at that time.
247981,timmeh,2008-09-09 16:32:00,609,"I fished a couple of huron tribs a few days ago and caught, nor saw anything resembling a salmon in the rivers. There were a few people fishing and no one else had any action either. Locals told me the run hasn't started yet.  I would wait until you hear word that fish are being caught as it's quite a far drive to get skunked."
247982,Scott S,2008-09-09 16:33:00,203,Lake Huron is always later than Lake Ontario. Just a few being caught here and there. Salmon are still deep out in the lake. Scooter
247986,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-09 16:48:00,0,"Thanks for the information.  Yes, I meant Lake-Huron .. not Erie (my geography teacher back in high school kept asking me why I suck at geography but ace math, physics, chemistry .. hah)  I will pass on the message to my buddy"
247999,Wild,2008-09-09 17:53:00,704,So this sounds like a great time to hire a charter and chase them! I take it they would still be better eating than lake 0:
248081,Canuck2fan,2008-09-09 23:25:00,1444,In general my sources tell me with the water temp still in the low 70's on the weekend nothing going on yet. That is not to say the lucky might not catch one. Hell I have seen coho caught in all but July LOL.
248206,ChrisK,2008-09-10 10:43:00,2772, And you meant Bayfield not Mayfield like you stated on your original post which I corrected for you  Cheers
255086,FearTheMullet,2008-10-03 17:08:00,6,"Anyone know if the run has started up that way yet? I'm planning a trip up to the Maitland Falls Reserve for some (hopeful) action. Wouldn't be the first time in the last few years where the trip was failed, although if anyones been up that way itd be nice to know what the runs like, if its even started yet!  "
255098,BillM,2008-10-03 17:53:00,17367,"According to the fellows on the Grey/Bruce forum, nothing as of yet."
255233,Canuck2fan,2008-10-04 00:52:00,1444,"I am hearing that the run is non existent this year..... salmon numbers are down from last year to this point and nobody sounds hopeful it will pick up. As for this weekend be prepared for high, fast and MUDDY conditions."
257147,FearTheMullet,2008-10-10 03:34:00,6,"As an update myself, went today to check it out (made a thread about it), we also went last weekend as we planned, last weekend there were actually fish taken in the morning (not by us, but by the early birds). Today, however, as I outlined in my thread - nothing at all. This time we were the early birds, even. But not a damned thing to be found."
