I usually dont have much luck this time of year on the lake, almost as though it shuts down  Anyhow, are the fish generally hugging bottom now, or cruising very close to the shoreline?  Do they hit topwater or something dragged?  Approx what depth/where would they be found at this time of year?  I just dont want to be skunked is all  thank you all in advance for your help!  -mark"

Just launch the boat at the rowing club launch and start casting on that side of the lake. We did well on rattle traps in about 10 to 15' of water also white spinner baits. When you launch got to the left away from the dam head to wards the beach area
