A few hours later I got a call saying that my bid was the highest.  The first day I had a couple of the guys from our flyin group join me.  Some pretty good fishing was had.  Marked a ton of fish in 40+ feet of water and jigged up a herring in a couple of minutes.  We didn't give it too much time and went for some bass.  Had a great time catching several bass with the biggest being about 3 pounds.  Still don't know why we didn't take any pics but a good first day.  The next day a front came in.  The fishing was pretty tough only a couple of small bass were had after exploring tons of water.  The guys had to head out around noon so a short fish and not much to show for it.  Still, good times were had by all.  My Dad and his wife showed up as the guys were getting ready to leave. Loaded up one group and unloaded the next.  Dad and I got out for a couple of hours before the next wave of storms came in but were not so lucky.  In for some dinner and plan our attack for the rest of the week.  The week ended up being a very relaxing one with slow paced start to the day, a bit of work (decided to strip and paint the boat trailer.) or fishing, eating, and more fishing.  It took a bit to figure out the walleye but once we got on them, it made for some great fishing.  Did a bit of muskie fishing as well and boat a decent one while trolling. Too bad my Dad didn't get it but it was a great fight for me!   All in all it was a great week.  Now some fishing porn.  View of the lake.    Dad and a walleye.   Myself and the biggest of the trip at 20 inches   A few for a meal.   A picture for Joey.  DAMN YOU SUSPENDED FISH!!!   One of our visitors that we had.  I managed to get about 20 feet away before this guy took off.     Some pics of our muskie adventure.  It measured up at 37 inches.     And finally a beautiful Haliburton sunset.    You can bet that I'll be back."
