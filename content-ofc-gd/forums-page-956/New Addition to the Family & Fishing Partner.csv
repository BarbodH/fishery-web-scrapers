My Shaina was an American Pitbull and was my best friend and she will never be forgotten.. The house has never felt so empty so i broke down and bought a new Pup, a boxer this time as to the fact of the Pitbull ban i thought the choice was fitting. The family has takin a real liking to Shimano LOL Sure he will fit in just fine and i cant wait to get him in the boat. After seeing Spiel with his Pup in September it brought back alot of memories for me which got me thinking it was time . Here are a couple pics of the new family member.. The first one is Shaina!    <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/?action=view¤t=CCF10082008_00001-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/CCF10082008_00001-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>      <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/?action=view¤t=IMG_0140.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/IMG_0140.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/?action=view¤t=IMG_0126.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/IMG_0126.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/?action=view¤t=IMG_0128.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/IMG_0128.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/?action=view¤t=IMG_0138.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/puppy/IMG_0138.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
