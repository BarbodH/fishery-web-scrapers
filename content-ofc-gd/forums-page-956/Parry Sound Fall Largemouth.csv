I figured it would be smallmouth and pike mostly as the lake seemed fairly deep along the shorelines.  I managed to get a canoe for a few hours so me and a friend went out for an hour or so just around the camp.  First couple casts I got this nice largemouth off a submerged tree on a spinnerbait.  My scale said she was right on 5 pounds, she was a fatty.    My friend got a nice 3 pound smallmouth off the same tree and it was his first bass so he was pretty pumped.  That was all the fishing I got in for the weekend, but i'm glad I went out.  And I would love to fish that area more, what a beautiful place this time of year."
