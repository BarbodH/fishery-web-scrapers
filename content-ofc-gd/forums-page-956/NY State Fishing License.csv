Thanks alot! Joe"
256966,charlied,2008-10-09 19:23:00,584,NY licence runs from Oct 1st to Sept 30.....I just renewed mine!  I have no idea on spots on the catt.....but with the rain it could be a crap shoot!
257036,Billy Bob,2008-10-09 23:18:00,5865,"Charlie has the dates correct on  our NYS fishing licenses. Oct 1 to Sept 30th.  I was at the Catt yesterday but only to launch and motor out for perch fishing which I prefer. HOWEVER, I always check on what is going on as far as trout/salmon fishing at the Catt.  NOW is PRIME for the Catt.  I talked to one local while getting my minnows for perch fishing and he said he already got his limit that morning (I talked to him at 8:00am) with skein.  One the way back in at 11:30am there were still some boat fishing in the creek and just outside the mouth of it. When I motioned how they were doing they gave me the THUMBS UP.  BTW the perch fishing is EXCELLENT (25 perch) and was hoping to return on Friday but I see the winds are going to be high, however Saturday is looking better."
