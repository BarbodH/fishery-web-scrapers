256836,e-z-out,2008-10-09 12:58:00,1052,no matter what you do you will always have cookies and tracking cookies they don't slow you down they just help you load the page from where they came from faster. If your on 56K then leave them be but if your Cable or T1 then you don't need them so tick it off and your set. Hope that helps Lew

Tracking cookies may report back to a website which collects your surfing habits so yes you can check the box however I would manually clean out cookies and downloaded files manually as  regular maintenance which is easy it just depends on which browser you are using.
