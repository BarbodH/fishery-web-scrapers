There is probably still some staged kings waiting for another good rain fall to make a push up the creeks to their spawing beds.  Target the pier mouths for the stagers.  U would have to go way deep for 1-3 year olds this time of year.  Good luck, for type of fishing rig and fishing your after, check out this board: spoonpullers.com  I am sure there's some past posts here too that will lead u in the right direction."
