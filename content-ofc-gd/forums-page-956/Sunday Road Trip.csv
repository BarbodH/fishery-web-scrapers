Ken had a couple of things that he wanted me to look at and it was a chance to check in on his mom.  We decided on the Rideau as Ken hadn't fished it in over 15 years and it would be about the same for me if not longer.  Our day in a nut shell. On the road at 5:30am, on the Rideau by 9am, first fish at 9:15am A total of 17 fish consisting of pike, largemouth and smallmouth, off the water around 4:30pm, to Ken's mom's for dinner and to take some pictures of some things she wants to sell, on the road home by 7:30pm, stopped for gas and timmies, pulling into the Newcastle area when Ken realizes he forgot his keys at his Mom's....DOH!!!, drive Ken to his house to get the spare set, drive to my place and unload and in bed at 12:30am. Spending all that time with a good friend.....priceless.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  No real big fish caught but a great day on the water.  The weather was awesome!  Thanks for the PM Justin and thanks to Cliff for the use of the GPS for the day as I was having technical issues with mine.  Here's a couple pics from the day.  A picture of Ken after telling me the batteries in the camera were dead and that he couldn't get a picture of my pike.  Seems to have worked OK for me.    (The batteries were very close and did give me a warning later in the day.)   Some scenery, the colours were starting to look nice.    And finally the ""big bass"" of the day.     Thanks Ken for a great day!"

256993,fishnsled,2008-10-09 21:22:00,3520,"Thanks for the replys.  Joey - I always have extra batteries.  Just razzing Ken as I took about 30 shots after he claimed that they were died.  Cliff - You better do something about that job.  I'll be passing you in post counts it you don't watch it.  (In my dreams)  Those waypoints should help, Timmies in Smith Falls, Canadian Tire, Walmart - all great spots."
