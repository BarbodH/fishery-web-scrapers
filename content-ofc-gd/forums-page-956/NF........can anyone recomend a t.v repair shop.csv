256753,ctdd2006,2008-10-09 01:45:00,531,Have you tried barking at samsung direct?  Their service is actually not bad.  The DLP's were a bad tv and they may work with you.   Worth a try.  I own a store that sells tvs and I have been (rarely) impressed but it happens where a manufacturer steps up.  In this case they may as there are many documented problems with the DLP hence why they didn't last.
