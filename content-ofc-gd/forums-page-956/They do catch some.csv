256016,Bernie,2008-10-06 22:34:00,3190,Just noticed this in the local paper.  http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1234976
256018,irishfield,2008-10-06 22:36:00,26272,Great to see isn't it Bernie!!!! They also got/seized gear/boat/truck/trailer off Lake Temagami early this summer. Haven't seen that one come out in print yet.
256022,Dondorfish,2008-10-06 23:05:00,1000,   Good to see - wish we saw alot more reports like this  Don
256024,Bernie,2008-10-06 23:07:00,3190,"Yes it is good to see Wayne. No sympathy from me. Was on my way out to the cottage last week and I seen a guy fishing with 2 lines.  Stopped by to have a chat with him. Asked him how the fishing was. ""Nothing"" was his reply. We chatted for a bit and he seemed like a pleasant fellow (from the good old USA), so then I told him he was allowed only 1 line. ""Really?"" he replied and promptly wound it in..  Well he did plead ignorant so I calmly suggested he read up on the regulations when he got back to camp."
256048,the spirit of fishing,2008-10-07 00:27:00,141,Good to see the CO's out and causing these kind of people some financial pain; my first thought was a longer suspension of his licence would have been nice but from the sounds of what he was doing he'd likely fish without a licence anyway.
256097,jediangler,2008-10-07 03:40:00,1923,"If the ministry is hard up for cash they could go to Mountsberg on any Saturday.  I saw a guy with live minnows, alcohol, he didn't pay and he was bragging to others that he brought home a garbage bag full of pike last weekend. He was also fishing from the railway tracks which would earn him a trespassing charge and a hefty fine. The sign is in plain view in the parking lot and states no live bait, no alcohol and a 2 pike limit."
256101,Stern Rules,2008-10-07 04:24:00,342,"Obviously the CO's can't be everywhere but it's good when they do catch poachers. That's why people should use the tip line when they see something illegal. Two guys in New Brunswick a few weeks ago got caught with 49 brook trout, limit is 5 each. They got a $1700 fine and lost their gear. It's not worth it."
256167,Gerritt,2008-10-07 15:02:00,6129,Glad to see the boys @ work!
256184,steverowbotham,2008-10-07 15:47:00,1800,he deserves it. what a fool
256211,joonmoon,2008-10-07 17:30:00,528,Yeah...   In my opinion he got off lucky...should have fined him that much for each fish.
256242,darsky,2008-10-07 19:46:00,586,"     yeah but what about this:   Manhunt on in Temagami area Posted By Nugget Staff Updated 6 days ago   TEMAGAMI — Ontario Provincial Police are Searching for a wanted man in the area of Spawning Bay on Lake Temagami today.  An arrest warrant is outstanding for Jonathan Paul of Bear Island following an altercation there Sept. 19.  Police say an officer spotted Paul on Lake Temagami around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday.

256244,Paully,2008-10-07 20:01:00,712,Where do the MNR sell these seized items? wouldent mind gettin my hands on some cheap stuff!
256293,NAC,2008-10-07 23:39:00,369,"This would just be a minor set back for the weekly onslaught of smallies at the mouth of the Maitland.  They'd be back in a few days with new gear, no license and not a care.....  Same crowd, same place, every year and everybody knows."
256319,Greencoachdog,2008-10-08 00:28:00,8163,What the hell are these people thinking???  I'd hate to know I was so damn desperate for a fish that I'd have to lower myself to poaching!!!
256450,douG,2008-10-08 15:20:00,2693,"Did anyone who read the story in the Nugget scroll down to the bottom of the page?  There's an advertisement that reads,""Bag a Freezer Full of Walleye Every Time You Go Fishing"".   Whoops!"
256512,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-08 17:54:00,2050,"JediAngler -  I see signs with regs @ many boat launches in the states....I like the idea, but I suppose it'd only help those of us who care to adhere to the regs....."
