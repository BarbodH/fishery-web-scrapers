412485,Jen,2009-12-16 15:58:00,833,Things are shaping up good lots of water tightened back up last night 2 more days and ill be going for a walk with the Ice Spud ...Fishmaster   
412492,FisherMike,2009-12-16 16:10:00,108,what do you catch there through the ice???  ive only ever fished for catfish there.  im guessing the cats are gone this time of year.
412495,basskicker09,2009-12-16 16:15:00,144,i can answer that for you they do alot of walleye fishing through the ice on the lower grand and crappie as well sometimes you can get cats through the ice you just never know with the grand  just ask steve at fishmasters and im sure he can point you in the right direction
412515,johnl,2009-12-16 17:52:00,197,you figure it will be safe in 2 days?
412517,FisherMike,2009-12-16 17:55:00,108,right on!! i'll definitely have to give it a try this winter.  hooking into a grand river cat would be a helluva fight through the ice.
