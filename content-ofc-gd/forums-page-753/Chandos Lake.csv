412770,irishfield,2009-12-17 06:16:00,26272,Just type Chandos Lake into Google and it will come up with OFC threads etc..  short answer sounds like Yes.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/lofiver...php/t15011.html  EDIT.. so maybe that was the short answer.... sure seemed like some OFC'rs went ice fishing! lol
412806,Michael_Brown,2009-12-17 13:10:00,411,I just checked the new regulations and Chandos is still closed to winter fishing. It should be open to several species it remains closed. This lake is in Zone 15 and feel free to contact the local MNR in that area and offer your opinion. They may have a fishery advisory council set up for that zone. Feel free to contact the council and ask if opening Chandos to winter angling is being considered. Pike and panfish could probably be angled for without impact to the other species in the winter. If they are trying to protect the lake trout or walleye just close those species and open the rest. Actually I think I'm going to call.
412826,Raf,2009-12-17 14:25:00,3495,it is likely to protect the lake trout since they will be anywhere in the water column in the winter.  i've caught them off the shallow shoals pike fishn in the spring.
412836,Michael_Brown,2009-12-17 14:57:00,411,They may well be trying to protect the lake trout but then close lake trout season or use a large slot limit all season on the lakers to ensure protection year-round. Restricting access to all the other species in the lake is limiting angling oppourtunties unneccessarily.  Closing entire fisheries to protect one species is old thinking and there is lots of other options.
