412954,Abraxus,2009-12-17 20:26:00,104,"That is terrible.  Especially near the Hollidays.  Realistically, the operator of the car that fled and the officer who decided to use the spike belt are equally at fault here.  The young girl is really the only true victim.  The officer should never be permitted to wear a badge again after that kind of bungle.  This particular detatchment should also be sued beyond belief!  If it were my daughter, I would have that officer and his department drained dry!  Hopefully this does not get swept under the rug and buried from public eye.  Much can be learned from this and the entire event should be subject to extreme scutiny and  public Inquiry.  This is gross negligence and there is no two ways of cutting it!  You cannot carelessly place the innocent lives of civilians in harms way like that for a controlled substance violation.  It is reckless and negligent behaviour resulting in death.  The kid was a local, they could have picked him up at his home at a later point, or issued a warrant for his arrest.  I am not sure what the controlled substance was, but I would assume Pot.  In any event, do you really think the life of an innocent young girl was worth the arrest and subsequent charge for a drug possesion wrap? Ignorant and deplorable.  The police are supposed to have protocols in place for such aggressive actions and apprehension tactics.  Either this detatchment has not been brought up to speed on such standard operating proceedures or the officer acted on his own in contradiction to such said protocols.  Either way, basic boot camp and re-education should be manitory for all officers in that area as a result of this event.  Sad...very sad! I feel sorry for all involved.  Ab"
412957,walleyejigger,2009-12-17 20:40:00,876,"what if they let the kid go and he hits somebody and kills them do to being under the influence of a controlled substance, most of you would begging for a linching of the officer for not having stopped him earlier, it's a loss loss for the police in you're eyes regardless, it seems fine to some of you that the kid made a mistake but not the officer, remember without the kid NONE of this would have happened, it's a tragic event in all aspects and for all involved"
412965,bubbles,2009-12-17 20:51:00,591,this is terrible for all involved.  this thread is not going anywhere good.

412632,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-16 23:51:00,0,Anybody hear about the nasty accident that killed two people up near North Bay? The OPP were trying to stop someone by using a nail strip to take out the tires on the car they were after. They forgot to close the hwy coming south. The nail strip caused the guy driving north to swirve into oncoming traffic killing him and the girl in the other car coming south. Nasty story....
412635,Terry,2009-12-16 23:54:00,14456,did hear  but it's a shame
412637,irishfield,2009-12-16 23:55:00,26272,Not good... that reads lawsuit (to the tax payers) all over it.  Glad that Leah just texted me 10 minutes ago.. to say she'd arrived in Ottawa...after a nasty 7 1/2 hour drive.
412638,misfish,2009-12-16 23:59:00,29133,"This one? COLLISION RESULTS IN TWO FATALITIES    (WEST NIPISSING, ON) – On December 13, 2009, at approximately 9 p.m., North Bay Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officers were conducting a Festive R.I.D.E. on Highway 17 east of the city of North Bay when they stopped a vehicle.  As a result of that stop, two officers were in the process of arresting both the driver and an occupant of the vehicle for a Controlled Drugs and Substance Act (CDSA) investigation when the driver fled the scene causing minor injuries to one of the officers.    The driver proceeded westbound on Highway 17 towards Sturgeon Falls.  The West Nipissing Police Service assisted the OPP by deploying a spike belt in an attempt to stop the vehicle.  The driver of the fleeing vehicle went over the spike belt and continued westbound colliding with an eastbound vehicle.    As a result of the collision, the drivers of both vehicles have died of their injuries.    The Provincial’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has been notified and has invoked its mandate.  Further inquiries should be directed to SIU Communications at (416) 622-2342."
412656,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 01:08:00,0,  Lawsuit?....sounds more like criminal negligence causing death if you ask me. I think that stands for 20 years in jail.  thought about it.  ..Im wrong about the Crim neg............
412675,Whitespinnerbait,2009-12-17 01:50:00,2038,Tragedy that the girl was killed.......Blessing in disguise that the dude fleeing went down
412679,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 01:55:00,983,  I'd prefer to see him have to live with what he did.
412683,Dara,2009-12-17 02:01:00,3052,  For the cops that aparently negligently put out the spike belt
412697,TJQ,2009-12-17 02:21:00,7806,"Its a pretty sad thing...  both young and local.  The young man was not a bad kid by all accounts, but made a very bad decision.  dunno what he was thinking.  It's pretty shocking for our small community, I'm sure the officers that  were involved are not feeling very good about the whole affair either.   No one came out ahead here.   Hers a bit more info in the Globe:  A spike belt laid on a rural Ontario highway by police to stop someone fleeing a RIDE check was hit by the suspect's car, which then veered into oncoming traffic and hit another vehicle, killing both drivers.  The accident happened on Sunday night on Highway 17 near Sturgeon Falls.  Angele Penasse, of Sturgeon Falls, Ont. and Ghislain Gareau, of Verner, Ont., both in their early 20s, are dead, according to family members.  OPP and the Special Investigations Unit have yet to confirm their names or release any further information.  The SIU has been called in to investigate the accident.  According to North Bay OPP, officers were conducting RIDE checks along Highway 17 just east of North Bay, when they stopped a vehicle carrying two men.  When they attempted to make an arrest, one of the men took the car and fled the scene, driving west along Highway 17.  To try to stop the car, West Nipissing Police Service deployed a spike belt on the highway just outside Sturgeon Falls, which is about 40 kilometres from North Bay. The car failed to stop and hit the eastbound vehicle.  The OPP alerted the SIU just after 9 p.m. on Sunday. The mandate of the unit is to conduct independent investigations into civilian deaths resulting from police actions.  According to a friend, Ms. Penasse had recently finished her college studies to become a personal support worker.  A memorial page was dedicated to Mr. Gareau on Facebook yesterday. One message reads, ""He was such a special person that every one loved. We will miss you."""

412703,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 02:30:00,0,  The whole thing is a tragedy.
412713,Dara,2009-12-17 02:46:00,3052,  Definetly a tragedy.  I feel for you and your town TJ..very sorry. my daughter lives in North Bay and i know that stretch of highway. I witnessed a death there a few years ago.
412780,Whitespinnerbait,2009-12-17 11:26:00,2038,  To kill some else a couple of weeks later ....
412781,solopaddler,2009-12-17 11:42:00,8605, But..he didn't kill anyone. He lost control of the vehicle as a result of the spike belt.  Very sorry to hear about this. Both so young with their whole lives in front of them. It's way beyond tragic.
412782,BUSTER,2009-12-17 11:52:00,1336,Iam with you .
412787,Fisherman,2009-12-17 12:20:00,7201," Oh boy, now we really have some logic, you drive, you're in control, the PO says stop, you stop, you don't, you suffer the consequences of your actions.  I really feel sorry for the other driver that lost her life and the grief the family goes through."
412790,Muskieman,2009-12-17 12:25:00,2472,Sad indeed... I knew them both.  And they knew each other...  Gonna take a while for this little town to get over it.  RFS 
412796,solopaddler,2009-12-17 12:42:00,8605,"  So by your logic a young man who has been characterized by people who knew him as being generally good and well liked deserved the fate that befell him? You feel sorry for the other driver and her family but not for the young man and his family? You're a hard man. Obviously perfect in every way, never having made a mistake or used poor judgement in your entire life. Oh that we could all be as perfect as you.  Yes the young man made a mistake. But...the fact remains that the spike strip laid on the hwy to stop him resulted in the unfortunate fatal accident. Does he deserve to be smeared in death? I don't think so.  My sympathies go out to both families involved."
412805,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 13:10:00,0,Its to bad that more than three people had to be involved. Two died and the rest will be dealing with it the rest of their lives. We trust our authority to use force. That being said. We all screw up.
