412354,Paully,2009-12-16 01:48:00,712,"Montreal is in ninth    and we're only 2 points behind them, with a game in hand.  Thats good enough for me..."
412371,charlied,2009-12-16 02:48:00,584,Don't get the bias Ottawa fans going again.  Leafs are doing just fine!!  Hopefully the won't crap the bed in January like they normally do!!
412442,siwash,2009-12-16 13:24:00,683," Like I said when this thread originally started; the Leafs will be fine. The organization is going in the right direction... Mtl on the other hand, is sticking with Gainey (for now) - a once great hockey player, but a lousy manager as evidenced by his team's play since he started there.. they are the most arrogant fans and they're getting what they deserved! Gomez is having a great year, eh? Man that deal makes the Jason Blake deal look alright! Gomez makes 8 mill per season - he has 4 goals..  God, if I hear another Ole, Ole Ole Ole...chant I am going to vomit. You'd think you're watching a Spanish League soccer game."
412648,PAZE,2009-12-17 00:31:00,132,"  Umm just to let you know, the Leafs never lost draft picks......Boston lost Kessel"
412721,muskymatt,2009-12-17 03:26:00,2608,Soooooo......  6 goals against.....that makes the laffs the most scored against team...toskala smoskala...
412737,John Bacon,2009-12-17 04:13:00,3277," I am not sure what you are getting at...  Kessel was a restricted free agent.  When a team signs a restricted free agent they have to compensate the former team.  The Leafs compensated Boston by giving them two first round and one second round draft picks.  Thus, my comment that they traded away the draft choices that could help them rebuild."
412773,jediangler,2009-12-17 07:56:00,1923,"As of today the Leafs are 29th place, only the hurricanes are below them and they've allowed less goals. They are 6-4-0 in their last ten games though, so start planning the parade route."
413084,PAZE,2009-12-18 02:14:00,132," I totaly understand how it all works, Im just saying the Leafs came out on top with this deal, they new exacly what they where getting, with draft picks you never know, so as my last statement the Leafs never lost draft picks, boston lost Kessel."
413111,spinnerbaitking,2009-12-18 03:36:00,1622,all the leafs around here are under snow & likely will be til spring Richard
413117,jediangler,2009-12-18 04:10:00,1923,"Tampa Bay lost tonight and vaulted the Leafs into 28th place. I agree that you never know with draft picks, especially with the Leaf scouting staff. The year Kessel was drafted in the first round Boston took Milan Lucic in the 2nd round. The Leaf scouts passed on Lucic twice drafting Tlusty and Kulemin instead. With the Leafs scouting staff I'm not surprised that they feel high draft picks are of no value."
413128,irishfield,2009-12-18 04:35:00,26272,Montreal got boo'd off the ice tonight as well !
413208,jimmer,2009-12-18 16:46:00,2730,"Kessel is showing that he is better than any of the prospects for the 2010 June draft, so I would take a known entity over an unknown one for sure.  Yes, it sucks that Burke traded away the draft picks but he still might make some deals to get some back. I am a Leaf fan, but would hate to be their coach with the way they play from game to game."
404083,muskymatt,2009-11-20 12:49:00,2608,I heard they were playing the Hurricanes last night. Did they win?  I missed it as I was watching the SEns pound the Stanley cup champs.....
404091,PAZE,2009-11-20 13:23:00,132,"The Leafs will finish just like the Sens this year, know where."
404094,spinnerbaitking,2009-11-20 13:27:00,1622,The more they loose the better I feel haha Richard
404104,jediangler,2009-11-20 13:44:00,1923,"Looks like Boston will have their pick of either Taylor or Tyler. I feel sorry for Ian White, hopefully he'll get traded to a real team."
404107,anders,2009-11-20 13:46:00,1168,there right where they should be....So my bruins can get that top 2 pick!
404124,addymark,2009-11-20 14:29:00,69,ron wilson needs to be let go.  He mixes the lines every other game.
404205,jediangler,2009-11-20 17:49:00,1923,"Can't blame Wilson, he's got no players, that's why he is desperately trying to find a combo that works. Nothing halfway decent on the farm either so bringing guys up won't help. They are playing at their potential right now. I think I might have over estimated their finishing with 54pts."
404208,tonyb,2009-11-20 18:08:00,1637,Bad luck strikes again last night..  phantom double-minor penalty that resulted in a canes goal disallowed goal in OT  
404210,Paulus,2009-11-20 18:10:00,522,My new slogan for the Leafs:   GO LEAFS G......oh... oh nooooo!  p.-
404214,Headhunter,2009-11-20 18:14:00,5703,"Well, I'm still waiting for the city to come by and clean up the road in front of my house as it appears as though every leaf in the city is lying on the road, out in front of my house... I thought I saw Blake tucked in under the curb. HH"
404217,irishfield,2009-11-20 18:28:00,26272, Yah that was kind of sad when Carolina kicked it in themselves! Figured the Leaf's coach would have been jumping up and down and screaming over that.. but no.. I guess he's given in to this being the norm for his team.
404240,misfish,2009-11-20 20:05:00,29133,"HAHAHAHA  Turned the game on just before the go ahead go in the third.Wife says,hey,they might win one.I say,it not over yet.LOL   Shoot out was SAD.The monster is out of his eliment in that part of the game."
404243,walleyejigger,2009-11-20 20:07:00,876,"got an email the other day, wish i would of kept it.  was a picture of a sign in front of a bar that said"" Free beer during all leafs playoff games"""
404245,jimmer,2009-11-20 20:13:00,2730,It's definitely getting harder to watch the games.  I keep questioning why I do it to myself!
404253,perchslayer666,2009-11-20 20:40:00,280,"Just get rid of the team, i'm sick of this."
404255,[email protected],2009-11-20 20:46:00,290,I'll never forget the game I went to in Buffalo 2 years ago....  I have a picture of the scoreboard of the leafs winning 2-0 with like 6 minutes left...  And somehow the game ends up 5-4 with Bryan Mc-ScoresOnHisOwnTeamMoreThanCoryCross-abe putting it in their own net...
404256,tributaryhunter,2009-11-20 20:53:00,108,"they should switch with the tennesse titans and play football, and tennesse should play hockey lol"
404259,siwash,2009-11-20 21:09:00,683,Very well   stop aggravating Leaf fans  Habs and Sens scuk too and aren't going anywhere...

404291,fishinguypat,2009-11-20 22:14:00,547,the leafs are having a real battle this year...a battle for the basement
404323,John Bacon,2009-11-20 23:45:00,3277,They are doing exactly what they have need to do every year since the lockout... suck bad enough to get good draft choices so they can rebuild.  Too bad they traded them away.  I guess Boston fans are happy.
404356,jediangler,2009-11-21 01:21:00,1923,I am happy and I can't see them being any better next year either so two 1st overall picks aren't out of the question. Thanks Brian Burke.
412346,siwash,2009-12-16 01:34:00,683,How are they doing? Not too bad these days...  About to catch the Scabs...
