412884,blaque,2009-12-17 16:40:00,2419,"Heard a tidbit on air the other day that Quebec may be getting a team back?  Complete rumoured rubbish? Or is there something to get excited about  Im no quebecer, but would really welcome the thought.  I loved the days when Hunter would roll into Buffalo and play some old time hockey!!! Good Tiimes. I LOVED the league back then.  At my nephews practice the other day one of the kids had a Nordique Michelle Goulet Home jersey on lol. (im in buffalo)"
412889,MooseMerch,2009-12-17 17:00:00,68,Ya i heard Lindros was going to be the coach
412894,Hellfish,2009-12-17 17:09:00,308,"I think they should put one further east in Nova scotia, I am not much of a hockey fanatic but I am sure it would do well out there."
412897,JohnF,2009-12-17 17:19:00,3494,  They were just confusing Quebec City and Saskatoon methinks.  JF
412948,Mike Pike,2009-12-17 19:40:00,1332,"NHL isn't planning to expand or move any of their francises, so I'm thinking no.  Unless it's in another league or something."
412964,Leecher,2009-12-17 20:46:00,7832,I heard that too..... be great to have the Nordiques back!!!
412983,misfish,2009-12-17 21:51:00,29133,"  That would be great.Then we all can pick on you guys,instead of you all pick,n on our leafs.LOL   This other rubbish about playing 5 or so games in Sask,is just Bull.Like Nick and Bill said,YOU THINK WE CANADIANS ARE STUPID. Keep yer team in the USA,and come up to play five games and grab our dollars here, and leave us high and dry with wishfull thinking? NOT.   Something Betman would think of. MORUN."
413028,JohnF,2009-12-17 23:59:00,3494," It's called cherry picking, but based on the NHL's decisions of late, it may well appeal to Bettman et al. They obviously use yardsticks totally unrelated to the game of hockey except as a cash cow.  JF"
413034,phiphntek,2009-12-18 00:10:00,115,the buzz with the talking heads is this...... more NHL WILL be coming to the great white north.Halifax is a stretch .Distance and demographics.Coyotes were just purchased  by Ice Edge  and can only lose 40 - 50 mill a year for so long in the desert. Hamilton and a second team in T.O. are the best guess.Little Napolean Bettman has already dropped hints.Q.C. has to get a new rink built first before any consideration.
413035,misfish,2009-12-18 00:13:00,29133,    Thanks for the laugh.
