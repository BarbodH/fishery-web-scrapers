413135,Woodsman,2009-12-18 05:34:00,1286,"If you look in the bottom right of the box in the post which you want to quote you will see a quote'' box. By clicking on this you will go to a new reply box. In the box you will see the entire post from the box you clicked the quote"" box. The quote will be inside symbols similar to [ quote ]  and  [ /quote ]. Type your new comments outside of these symbols. If you wish to quote only part of the original post delete the parts not required. Just ensure you do not put words in the mouth of someone you are quoting or deleting parts as to misrepresent what was actually said."

413229,bassjnkie,2009-12-18 17:56:00,1101,"# 1 on picture: If you click the QUOTE button on the post a plus sign will show, meaning you can add multiple quotes from different posts by just clicking the quote button. After you chose the ones you want go to the bottom an click the add reply button, you should see the quotes. # 2: Click the reply button in the post and just that quote will show up in you post, no need to click the reply button on the bottom. Hope this helps.  "
