The new Pro Weight system replaces the snap weight system and the new lead free weights can also be used as an inline weight. The other great new product is the OR36 Resettable Diving Weight (Tadpole). The Tadpole comes in 2 sizes and can be used with harnesses, spoons or to get your cranks deeper. I field tested the Tadpoles in 2009 on Lake Erie walleyes with very good success. I just picked up my shipment of the annual Off Shore Release newsletter and will drop them off at a few local dealers here in Windsor and surrounding area. _________________  "
