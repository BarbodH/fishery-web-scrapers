413016,camillj,2009-12-17 23:23:00,1988,Wow .. atta boy Lew !  I have my heart set on just such a Garage .... dont get me wrong the house is nice .... but I been looking for a garage just like that to put all the toys (that I wil acquire when I have the place to put them) in .... great work bud - and smack in the middle of heaven too !
413089,JPD,2009-12-18 02:29:00,296,"Congrats to you and the Misses Lew! Enjoy, you have worked long and more than hard enough to deserve this.  JP"
413108,Cookslav,2009-12-18 03:27:00,1457,"Congrats on your new home,  Jealous I am LOL.... The country has been calling me for a while now. Can't wait for the Local reports come summer time"
413137,Rattletrap2,2009-12-18 05:38:00,1652,"Congrats Lew! Looks like an amazing property and well, that ""Man Cave"" would have most of us drooling! LOL We made the move to the country about 2 1/2 years ago and love it. It is definitely a lot more work, but it is an enjoyable kind of work. Make sure Dianne knows that the snowblower, chainsaws, gas trimmers, and ATV, are TOOLS or IMPLEMENTS.....not toys! LOL  I made sure they were allowed for in the budget as well and tried to buy the best I could afford. So far, so good.  I use both an Ariens snowblower and a Polaris ATV/Plow to take care of the snow. I have a heavy duty Cub Cadet Garden tractor (not the HD specials either) for the green stuff. A blower attachment might work on an ATV, but Garden Tractors would struggle with snow. Even with wheel weights and chains.  I'm really glad to see you getting the rewards that you both have worked for all your lives! Enjoy!  Any thoughts on selling the trailer? We still have ours for now...but who knows? I just don't have the same desire to get up there now. Home is so peaceful! Take your time with that decision."
413143,lew,2009-12-18 10:26:00,12766,"The new place is only a couple miles from the trailer Brian and like you, I'm ready to pack it in now too, but the misses wants to keep it for one more season, and we all know the wives win these type of discussions   I may pop over a few times next season but won't be spending much time there.  We've been there since '74 and will definetely miss the place though.  As for the mower & blower, I'll have to start doing some thinking on those soon too.  Thanks again everyone and Steve, if you can make it over to my place from the Big O, the 6 pak will be on ME"
413216,bigbuck,2009-12-18 17:16:00,2449,"35 years at the same place, WOW!! I'm hoping for 10 where we are in HH, somebody will end up forking out a whole whack of dough for the property (5 acres a stone's throw from the centre of the town) and developing it. Good luck and good hunting on your 'Man Toys' aka the snow blower and tractor. Take care my friend. Have a very Merry Christmas!!!"
412152,limeyangler,2009-12-15 15:17:00,5204,"AWESOME DIGS LEW,  CONGRATS.....beautiful place to live."
412165,Marty,2009-12-15 15:56:00,873,I am sooooooooooooooo jealous.  Congrats on the new digs!
412167,bucktail,2009-12-15 16:05:00,1857,Congrats Lew thats awesome. Green with jealousy!
412194,Victor,2009-12-15 17:53:00,1609,Congrats on the new home Lew!  maybe another 40 years for me lol
412197,LeXXington,2009-12-15 18:03:00,1928,"WOW, that is a very nice garage , you could not have chosen a better building.  Water front is nice but for that garage WOW..  oh the house is ok if you like that type of thing"
412199,frozen-fire,2009-12-15 18:10:00,542,beautiful....congratulations!
412200,bubbles,2009-12-15 18:14:00,591,"Great spot Lew, congrats to you the misses and Marv.  Marv is gonna love that yard!"
412279,misfish,2009-12-15 22:47:00,29133,"You and the little women,have more then earned that retirement place Lew.  Well done.    Now to start, a hunting party.LOL"
412413,Big Cliff,2009-12-16 08:38:00,6899,"It looks beautiful Lew, congratulations!"
412422,Chris,2009-12-16 11:27:00,405,  WTG Lew....enjoy yer new digs!!!
412426,musky_man,2009-12-16 11:45:00,159,"Hey Lew,  Well done ... she  looks like a beaut!  I'd drool for that workshop space.  Should be very happy there.  Mark"
412431,Greencoachdog,2009-12-16 12:10:00,8163,"An absolutely beautiful home and property Lew!!! You and your wife really deserve it for working hard and staying cooped up in the city for all those years!  You'll really like how quiet and relaxing the country life is!  It is more work owning a larger property, but it'll keep you out of trouble and give the Muskies mouths a chance to heal up!  I agree with the others that suggest buying a good riding mower, I recommend a John Deere... but not one of those Home Depot ones, go to a dealer. I've had great service out of the John Deere ""K"" series engine... you don't get that engine in the ones from Home Depot!  Congratulations on your new home and property, you're gonna love it!!!"
412436,corvette1,2009-12-16 12:48:00,1765,thats awesome lew congrats on your new place
412443,lew,2009-12-16 13:26:00,12766,"Thanks once again folks for all the well wishes, I most certainly appreciate your thoughts.  As for the riding mower, this'll be the 1st time I've ever had enuff property to require anything more than a push model, but it's definetely on the shopping list and will be parked in the garden shed by the time the 1st blade of grass shows itself next spring.  And GCD, your suggestion about not buying from the big boxes will certainly be taken.  I don't take possession till the end of February but there'll still be plenty of snow around, so a snow blower is also in the works."
412455,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-16 14:18:00,627,Just a thought Lew. Is your driveway paved? If not you might consider a plow attachement for the riding lawnmower or ATV if you have one. Gravel and snowblowers don't get along too well together.  Tom.
412483,Harrison,2009-12-16 15:54:00,2202,"Hey Lew, that loft is perfect for a poker G2G followed by an icefish for giant panies within a baseball throw from your front door!  Just putting it out there..."
412488,Rizzo,2009-12-16 16:03:00,4754,"fantastic Lew! I didn't read all the replies so forgive me if I'm redundant...but you'll never be able to read a post like this one because you'll probably be on dial-up! We moved to the country 2 years ago and love it...but I have to open pic heavy posts like this at work (sh...don't tell the boss). Anyways, congrats to you and Diane, I hope you have many happy years there. And your posts after February will probably involve only 1 photo!"
412494,Jen,2009-12-16 16:14:00,833,Your New Place is awesome Lew...  I can't wait for the pictures and stories you share from there.  Congrats  Jen
412508,pikehunter,2009-12-16 17:35:00,1659,"Congrats lew!  That is one beautiful property, really like the garage!  You're going to have lots of space to work in and store your boat. Now if you're looking for a tenant to occupy the loft above it...."
412617,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-16 23:05:00,1362,Congrats Lew!! what a nice place you bought!!  ......I can picture myself sitting on the bar stool in your kitchen and also hanging out with you in the garage beside that beer fridge  I'm really happy for you guys!!!....you both must be really excited!!  Have a great Christmas!
412619,irishfield,2009-12-16 23:25:00,26272,At least you'd be able to drive home afterwards Steve.. 'cause that be Lew's Coke fridge!
412622,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-16 23:30:00,1362,
412627,tjsa,2009-12-16 23:37:00,1578,"Congratulations Lew, looks fantastic."
412883,OhioFisherman,2009-12-17 16:37:00,6623,"Lew buying a lawn tractor is a lot like buying a car, and everyone uses theirs differently and cares for it differently. I have a 20hp Husky riding mower from TSC (Tractor Supply) a MTD store brand, 46 inch cut. My front yard is bigger than your whole lot, trees, mounds with shrubs, edging along the drive.  I bought it in 1999 for like 2000-2200 with a bagging attachment, it still works fine, and it is used to cut almost 3 acres of land. It has only needed a few minor repairs, belt changes, a starter gear(nylon), a couple of batteries, deck blades and a pulley. It takes me about an hour to cut the front yard, bagging and emptying the clippings, with a zero turn mower it would be much faster.  It looks like you take care of your stuff, probably no need to go crazy with spending on one. Do yourself a favor, get a Hydrostatic drive one, you never know what is going to happen down the road, me and clutches don`t work well together now.  LOL if someone else besides you is driving it? Make sure they can grasp the concept that if the cut grass isn`t blowing out the deck it is clogged! The burning rubber smell is the belts that now have to be replaced."
413008,Ron,2009-12-17 23:05:00,1683,Very nice Lew!  I am sure you and your family will enjoy that piece of heaven for many many years.  Good on ya bud.  I guess the trailer is up for sale now?
412044,Terry,2009-12-15 02:54:00,14456,great place but lots of stairs...........
412045,Moosebunk,2009-12-15 03:03:00,3970,"YES LEW!!!  Very happy to see this for you man.  You're going to fit right into the country life, there's no doubt about that.  And, great spot!!!  What you don't get going without any waterfront you make up for in the home.  Agree with your choice.  Good luck with the move and your future there."
412046,douG,2009-12-15 03:03:00,2693,"Well done, Lew.  Paradise at last.  Thanks for sharing your life plans with us - all those years of hard work have paid off nicely, and certainly well-deserved."
412048,Weeds,2009-12-15 03:04:00,782,Good move Lew! I left East York about 3 years ago and while it was a nice place to live and grow up I have no regrets about relocating to the Peterborough/Kawarthas. You've got Musky at your doorstep and one heck of a garage; what more could a man ask for?
412052,Matt15,2009-12-15 03:12:00,107,"Great place, congrats. Thats my dream garage there heated and everything"
412059,caper,2009-12-15 03:23:00,210,"Nice place Lew, congrats. You'll have to get used to all that space after leaving the old homestead. Glad to see you found your dream home..East York will miss you guys I'm sure..  Craig"
412063,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-15 03:46:00,627,Welcome Neighbor!!!!  Not quite Lew but a lot closer than before. Congratulations.  Tom.
412070,bosc,2009-12-15 04:00:00,23,Congrats with the new place Lew. Good to hear you found a great place to settle. No more driving to the city for you.
412072,Beans,2009-12-15 04:06:00,3339,Absolutly terrific Lew !!!  You even got my garage beat by four feet...  You don't need the high property taxes of waterfront...  Maybe you will be able to find docking facilities near by ?
412076,Jacques,2009-12-15 04:32:00,97,"Congratualtions Lew.  A lot of us have enjoyed your posts and been nourished by your advice -- not just on fishing but on matters of family too.  Delighted to see you have found a place to nourish *your* soul and your family's.  Very, very happy for you."
412088,Hooked,2009-12-15 05:27:00,891,"Wow, that place is fantastic looking, and quite spacious to say the least.  I have a good feeling you and Diane are going to enjoy that place immensely, I know I would.  Congratulations Lew."
412098,lew,2009-12-15 09:40:00,12766,"Thanks for all the great feedback folks, it's much appreciated.  LOTSA room in that back yard, maybe once the snow melts we'll have an OFC g2g to christen the new digs  Now I gotta go shopping for a snowblower....."
412099,SlowPoke,2009-12-15 09:50:00,2984,Well done Lew! We're counting down the days until we move into our new place. I know what you're feeling right now and it only gets worse!
412103,pigeonfisher,2009-12-15 10:53:00,696,Awesome Lew.  Dreams do come true and this couldn't have happened to a nicer fella!  Congrats on the new digs.
412110,Rich Clemens,2009-12-15 11:22:00,3131,Yeah.  Congratulations Lew.  You've been thinking about this for some time now and glad it all came together.  Almost looks big enough for an OFC GTG sometime.
412112,OhioFisherman,2009-12-15 11:52:00,6623,"Congrats Lew! Looks good, best wishes to you and the family."
412113,Jer,2009-12-15 11:52:00,1426,Welcome to the Kawarthas (full time anyways). I've never regretted my move from Mississauga almost 14 years ago. You'll come to appreciate the simpler things in life.
412114,Daplumma,2009-12-15 12:02:00,1961,"Thats very cool Lew.Welcome to the country,we'll have you peeing off the deck in no time! Joe"
412116,FLEX ROD,2009-12-15 12:37:00,394,"Congarts Lew,  Life is too short not to enjoy it, and by being in the home and area that you enjoy really does make it great.  FLEX"
412120,doubleheader,2009-12-15 12:59:00,497,Looks great Lew. Marvin can now focus on warding off critters rather than robbers eh?
412125,John,2009-12-15 13:17:00,2956,"Congrat's Lew, great looking place."
412126,Harrison,2009-12-15 13:25:00,2202,"You and the miss' deserve it.  Offers still on the table for east york!  If I do the calculatons, I can retire 2033, plus 9 years.....huh, only 'bout 32 years left for me in the big smoke if things stay status quo."
412142,fishnsled,2009-12-15 15:04:00,3520,I was sold once I saw the garage.    Congrats to you and the misses Lew!!  Enjoy!!!
412150,bigbuck,2009-12-15 15:14:00,2449,"Get yourself a big one. Don't mess around with a small snowblower that you'll have to go up and down the driveway a dozen times. As for a lawn tractor, get a good one, don't cheap out because you'll end up regretting it. Another idea, have you thought about getting an ATV with a plow attachment?? I miss the country (I spent my summers as a kid on our family farm/getaway in Newtonville). I'm green with envy!! In another 20 years I'll be able to think about a move."
412151,irishfield,2009-12-15 15:17:00,26272,Like Bigbuck said.. and I'd consider a snowblower for the ATV..not a plow.
411953,lew,2009-12-15 00:16:00,12766,"I've been retired from the Fire Dept. for 9 years but my wife loved her job & wanted to continue working, but we always wanted to get out of Toronto...(who doesn't ??) and move to the country once she packed it in and now the time finally arrived.  We've had a house trailer at Lakefield on Lake Katchawanooka for 36 years now with alot of our best friends in the area and wanted to stay close by, and we finally found exactly what we've been searching for just 3 miles north of Yonges Point.....(10 minutes south of Burleigh Falls)..... and take possession in February.  I thought long and hard about water front, but decided not to bother as I'm constantly towing my boat to different lakes all the time anyways, infact I towed my boat more than 2500 miles this year alone. Were right beside Clear Lake with only a dirt road between me & the lake, infact the water is only 150' from me     If I want to lauch the boat there, it's only about 2 miles up the road to Kawartha Park Marina and that'll give me access to Stoney also.  The house is only 8 years old and is in beautiful condition and is wired for a generator and has central air and also central vac.  The property is 100' x 237' and at the end of the yard there's nothing but woods all the way back to hwy 28 a mile away. Gonna be a great place for me & the pooch to hike every day    Anyways, here's a few pics of the new digs.  I only took a couple and the rest are from the real estate website.  I said I wanted country & I meant it........the road into my place    A pic I took today....the house is actually beige but for some reason looks pink  There's a circular drive in front and then the long drive up to the garage. I'm gonna have to buy both a riding lawnmower & snow blower    The back with the full width deck    Back yard......check out the garage    Beautiful living room with wood fireplace        Huge den    Beautiful kitchen    Master with ensuite, including a huge shower with built in lights, skylight and corner jacuzzi and walkout to the rear deck      There's a couple more bathrooms, 3 more bedrooms,  laundry, mudroom  and a fully finished 8' high basement with a BIG family room downstairs.  I think what really sold me though was the HUGE garage.  It's 20' wide with remote door and a full 52' deep with a workshop at the far end. It's also fully insulated and has a propane furnace. I was in there yesterday and it was 70 degrees. Be a great place to build stuff and work on the boat all winter.  There's more than enough room inside for my 19' boat, van & car.    View inside    And upstairs above the garage is a 20 x 20 finished loft that even has hardwood floors. Diane says that'll be my spot whenever I get outta hand    Anyways folks, that's gonna be our new home very shortly and hopefully I haven't bored anyone, but I've waited a long time for this place and just thought I'd share it with you. If anyone wants me after February, you'll know where to find me"
411954,basketclam,2009-12-15 00:18:00,115,It's a beautiful part of the world!  Congratulations.
