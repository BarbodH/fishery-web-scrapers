412555,Arty,2009-12-16 19:51:00,12,"Moved to North Bay in the Fall and very excited for the up coming Ice Fishing season, but where should I begin is my question? Lake Nippising is alot bigger than what I'm use to. I hear Callander Bay is a spot to try. I also have a portable hut (thanks to duckdog) and indeed I walk out to my spots. I like the exercise. Where could I park and launch? Family is also coming up in January for some fishing and I don't want to let them down. I am not looking for your ""hot spots"", though I have never kept mine hidden. Just some help to get started. Love this forum and look forward to any help. Thanks"
412557,Joeytier,2009-12-16 20:03:00,3990,Welcome to the board.  I'm actually in the exact same boat as you.
412568,Mike01,2009-12-16 20:18:00,378,"Welcome Arty,  There are plenty of accessable spots within walking distance of shore.  The South Shore is generaly the ""hotspot"" for most of the winter.  All kinds of underwater humps and reefs.  You can park on the ice off Waltonian dr.  PM me for more specific directions"
412579,bubbles,2009-12-16 20:48:00,591,"Yep, fish the south shore, just look for the crowds, the ""secret"" spots are quickly reveiled."
412582,trapshooter,2009-12-16 20:56:00,1234,"Off the beach in Callander, you can park and walk out.  Pretty decent action at Opener.  You'll see people out there.  Deep water point is a bit of a drive but that's where I had the best action when I lived in North Bay for a winter.  There is a small access road beside one of the camps that goes out on the ice.  Once you're out there, there will be no question where the 'hot-spot' is.  Huts galore!!  30' with a 1/8oz glow jig tipped with a minnow was my confidence bait.  Don't forget your measuring device.... half of the walleye will be protected by the slot."
412600,Arty,2009-12-16 21:43:00,12,Awesome. Thanks for the info so far. I will have to keep the slot size in mind for sure. Can't wait for the fun to begin.
412614,Muskieman,2009-12-16 22:54:00,2472,"Eh!  Welcome to the board!!!  There is a good spot right downtown... just off Memorial Dr   they call it the ""Poop Chute"" you'll see a ton of huts there very soon.  RFS "
412645,Mike01,2009-12-17 00:24:00,378,almost forgot...Sunset point has been productive for me in the past as well.  Has a parking lot and boat launch right there so you don't have to haul things up the rocks!  Just set up near the other huts and you should be good to go.
412649,Bernie,2009-12-17 00:33:00,3190,Welcome to the territory Arty. Ben asked me the same question a couple years ago when he passed through. The guys have given you some good advise so far. I fish the other side of the Nipissing pond but rarely in the winter. Only when a few rowdys drag me out for a weekend.
412678,Arty,2009-12-17 01:53:00,12,Thanks for everything guys. I hope to get some good reports for these spots. Let me know if you are ever heading to Bay of Quinte area/Picton. I can try to help to direct you to a few spots.
412714,BassAsin,2009-12-17 02:48:00,806,more like 90% not 50% Ben    and that access is private property and has had some issues the past 2 years.
412829,trapshooter,2009-12-17 14:38:00,1234," Oh, too bad.  Thanks for the update.  It's been 3 years since I lived in North Bay."
