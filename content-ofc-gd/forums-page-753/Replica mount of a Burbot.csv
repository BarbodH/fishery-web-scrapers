412607,hookerdown,2009-12-16 22:26:00,110,"I heard from Shawn at Advanced Taxidermy earlier today.  He said the largest mold he could locate was 36 inches.  He even called a buddy of his at the Smithosonian and the largest Burbot he heard of was about 36 or so.  So by the looks of it, no replica mount for me."
412612,Handlebarz,2009-12-16 22:43:00,3790,I had a pickerel Walleye or what ever you want to call it done by Advance this year it was for my father and turned out amazing I gave it to him and he is so excited I will be going back to them again and again they have done just about anything you can imagine stop by there shop and visit them they will talk to you all day and will not steer you wrong.    here is a musky that they had ready to go when I was there   and the rare toothless musky 
412666,Gman,2009-12-17 01:36:00,126,"James, just to to Advanced and get it done right.  That's where I took my 19# brown the 34# king I caught this past summer. I'll be picking them up at the end of January or beginning of February.  They're the best around and very well priced, you'll be amazed at your options and their creativity.  Cheers G."
412177,hookerdown,2009-12-15 16:39:00,110,"I have heard and seen a couple of mounts done of some Burbot.  I am thinking that I should get a replica done of the one I caught this past winter (Don't know why I didn't think of this before).  I won't get it done for a while but hopefully in the future.  Does anyone know of any local taxidermists that can do a replica mount of a burbot?  I know in the GTA we got some amazing guys, but haven't heard of anyone in Ontario who has done such a mount."
412178,FLEX ROD,2009-12-15 16:43:00,394,I would think that Advanced would be able to do it for you. Give them a call and find out.  http://www.advancedtaxidermy.com/  FLEX
412181,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-15 17:03:00,0,They have done a few .....
412187,Kinger,2009-12-15 17:27:00,351,post a picture of your monster ling!!! i love them buggers.
412193,hookerdown,2009-12-15 17:51:00,110,Here is the link to a prior post that had the pics... hopefully it works  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry401973
412196,Roy,2009-12-15 18:00:00,13728,Ling and burbot are two different fish but we've been down that road before. Good luck on the burbot mount...I don't remember ever having seen one but I'm certain that many are being done.
412204,ehg,2009-12-15 18:22:00,2666,Hopefully you can find a taxidermist that could do a replica of that fine fish. Would be a challenge to get those colour patterns right. 
412205,jimmer,2009-12-15 18:25:00,2730,I must have missed that forum. I understand that they are one in the same.  Also regarding the colour pattern- they are actually quite easy to paint because of the definite markings.
412214,FisherMike,2009-12-15 19:07:00,108,"ive always thought that ling, burbot, eelpout are all the same fish.  the ling in the ocean (ling cod) are obviously different but what is the difference between a ling and burbot????  very nice ling/burbot by the way!!  should make a nice mount.  one of my guests from minnesota had a 37 incher mounted."
412224,irishfield,2009-12-15 19:40:00,26272,"As Roy said... Burbot and the common Ling are two different fish. Burbot is also know as a Lawyer.. not sure if that has anything to do with the slim or not (sorry Marty!) Burbot is the only member of it's, Lota, family and is a freshwater fish that is cod LIKE.. not a family member. The Common Ling is a member of the cod family and is an ocean fish.  So kinda like that Walleye/Pickeral deal. We all call them Ling.. but they are really Burbot ! People call them lots of things besides UGLY !! Lota lota or Ling, Eelpout, Loche, Freshwater Cod, Maria, Methy, Lush, Lawyer  Other common names include: American Burbot, Cusk, Dogfish, Eelpout, Freshwater Cod, Freshwater Codfish, Freshwater Crusk, Gudgeon, Lawyer, Ling, Lingcod, Loche, Lush (Alaska), Maria, Methy, Mother Eel, Mud Blower, Spineless Catfish, Lake (Swe)    (google is your friend ! LOL)"
412228,TJQ,2009-12-15 19:47:00,7806,Having a burbut mounted is against the law in Ontario!!!...         ..... (in my house anyway bwaahahahah)
412234,Terry,2009-12-15 19:55:00,14456,"I don't care what you want to call it Ling and burbot pickerel walleye brook trout specks speckled trout we know what you mean, call it whatever you father before you called it and it is just fine.................  crappies are papermouths, calico bass, strawberry bass, white perch, specks, speckled perch, sac-a-lait .does it really matter"

412245,bucktail,2009-12-15 20:33:00,1857,"I think getting onr done by Advanced would be sooooo cool , the markings would beautiful."
412305,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-15 23:56:00,0,The Ling/Burbot outa Joe have less markings than they do on Simcoe...

412313,misfish,2009-12-16 00:14:00,29133,   Any sort of mounting in your house is forbidden.
412343,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-16 01:22:00,0,  but this is OK......  
412344,Terry,2009-12-16 01:26:00,14456,I don't care what you call it   that is nasty
412502,hookerdown,2009-12-16 17:19:00,110,"I have seen a ton of Advanced Taxidermy's work and I have no doubts on how good their work is.  The problem is, are there any Burbot molds out there and particularly one that size?  I have sent the guys an email through their website so hopefully I will hear from them.  The other question is what is the best way to position the burbot for a mount.  (man that sounds so wrong!!!   )"
412506,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-16 17:31:00,0,"Reminds me of a joke...  A guy walks into a Taxidermist all sad and bent out of shape about his two pet Monkeys that died suddenly. He thought that having them stuffed would remind him of all the happy years he had them. The Taxidermist felt sorry for the gentleman and the guy decides to have the job done. The Taxidermist asked him."" How would you like them mounted?"" The guy looks at him kinda funny and says. ""No. Shaking hands would be good."
412509,Terry,2009-12-16 17:36:00,14456,it's an oldie but a goldie  LOL
