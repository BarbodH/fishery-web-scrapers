NAKED ROWERS DELAYED BY STORMS  England may be known for its chilly winter weather, but charity rowers Rich Hume and Tom Barnes, both from London, are about to feel even colder. The pair plan to spend the winter rowing across the North Atlantic in a small boat.  What’s more, they plan to do it naked.  The pair are competing in something called the Woodvale Race, a famously grueling ocean challenge completed by Ben Fogle and James Cracknell in 2005.  Hume, 27, and Barnes, 30, will spend more than two months at sea in a bright red row boat the size of a minivan. Named the Red Arrow, the boat offers minimal living space and no toilet, with only the ‘bucket and chuck it’ method for relieving oneself. The pair hopes to raise at least £100,000 (about $173,000 Cdn.) to fund research into the brain condition ataxia, a degenerative neurological disorder that affects walking, speech, and coordination which has left a friend of theirs in a wheelchair.  Neither has ever rowed a boat for more than a few hundred yards.  Hume notes “by taking on this massive challenge, we hope to raise awareness and money to help find a cure for ataxia. Crossing the Atlantic is a lifelong dream of both of ours, and we’re so pleased we can do this in aid of Ataxia UK.”  But the buff-naked British boaters hit a snag before they even got out of port, as heavy storms this week - with waves in excess of 60 feet - have delayed their departure. The pair have now elected to embark just after Christmas, when sea conditions are expected to settle.  Although the pair will face winter storms and possibly sharks on their two-month voyage, Barnes says his only real fear is “seeing Rich naked.”  To sponsor Hume and Barnes, visit www.justgiving.com/rowingtheatlantic"

412534,Lunker777,2009-12-16 18:50:00,866,"somethings not clicking with me..... How is it possible to row in the north atlantic... in winter... naked... with out gettin hypothermia ? Also, a small row boat in the NA would have very little chance would it not ????"
412537,splashhopper,2009-12-16 19:01:00,2931," I wonder if they could ""card them""?  Ie... they seem to be a danger to themselves and likely the rescuers that will surely be sent out to get them at some point."
