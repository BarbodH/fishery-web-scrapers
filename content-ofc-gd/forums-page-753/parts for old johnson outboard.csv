411967,boatman,2009-12-15 00:29:00,350,"Johnson never made a 12 hp, but the Gale division of OMC (Johnson's parent company) did. The 12 hp Gale built outboards were based on the 1953-56 OMC 15 hp, which is the predecessor to the 1957-76 OMC 18 hp. So you may either have a 12 hp or an 18 hp. Who knows. If you can post some photos and/or the model number I can tell you what you have."
411969,grt1,2009-12-15 00:30:00,638,try buckeye marine in Vermilion Bay Ontario  807-227-2020. they have been a johinson dealer for years but have recently given it up. They have a lot of parts for older motors
412100,Radnine,2009-12-15 10:29:00,1538,"Isn't Bernie (on this board) into old Johnsons? Wait a minute, that didn't sound right.... Jim"
412104,skinny,2009-12-15 10:55:00,442,i'm located in Delhi but would ship the item here if need be  the model # is 12D18B serial 32839  i will gt pictures today
412107,Roy,2009-12-15 11:11:00,13728,"Skinny, it's a Gale 1959, 12 HP deluxe. Here is a partial listing. http://www.antiqueoutboardwiki.com/wikka.p...akka=GaleModels"
412108,Spiel,2009-12-15 11:15:00,9065,I used to source parts for my old 25 seahorse from Bay City Marine in Hamilton and Don Hyde Marine in Hagersville. One or the other always had what I needed.
412111,boatman,2009-12-15 11:34:00,350,"I don't have the parts catalogue for that motor, but I would expect that any 15-18-20-25 OMC top mounted recoil from 1956-1976 would fit. Tune-up parts are the same as Johnson/Evinrude. Go to the Ask-a-member-board at AOMCI.org and ask what motors share the same recoil.  I should have also added that the coils are probably shot on your motor. The original coils had a 100% failure rate. There should be an inspection plate on top of the flywheel. Remove it and take a look in there. If the coils are cracked, sweaty or discolooured they are bad even if they spark. You can get new ones from your dealer ($35 each) or NAPA ($26).  A few pictures would help."
412121,Garnet,2009-12-15 13:01:00,2056,Scugog Island Marina use to have lots of old OMC parts. Think they changed hands but might be worth a call.  Garnet
412124,Bernie,2009-12-15 13:15:00,3190,Great old engines. Lots of good advise given so far. I would look at the lower unit parts and the water pump before spending a lot of time and money on it first. No point in getting it running if the lower unit is bad. End up being more than what it is worth.
412819,skinny,2009-12-17 14:10:00,442,sorry for picture delay     
413104,boatman,2009-12-18 03:03:00,350,Yup. That is pretty much a 1955 Evinrude 15 hp with a few changes/differences. As I stated at aomci.org any recoil from a 1949-55 10-15 hp Johnson/Evinrude will work. If you want to use that Johnson hood you will need the cowl mounts for it. You really don't want to run it without them. It'll rattle like nothing you've ever heard before.
413131,Bernie,2009-12-18 04:53:00,3190,"If you can't find a rewind, let me know. I think there should be a few of those kicking around somewhere.  Might even have some mounts for that hood. You may need to wait until the snow is gone though as many of them are presently buried with it."
413153,Radnine,2009-12-18 11:37:00,1538, Eh!! Did I tell you or what? This is why we elected him captain of Team #8. Jim
