412083,Eazy,2009-12-15 05:03:00,260,"Picked myself up a spool of this today, can't wait to try it out, just wondering if anyone else has tried it?"
412243,icceman,2009-12-15 20:21:00,36,"As far as my understanding is, the ice line is the same as there new crystal brand.  Only diffrence is smaller spools.  Picked up some myself can't wait to try it."
412254,pike slayer,2009-12-15 21:30:00,1177,"i picked some up from crappy tire, that bright orange stuff. when i was spooling it on orange pieces were falling off like it was fraying already  im a little worried but time will tell. i also bought some power pro ice line and the stuff feels like its alot better quality and for cheaper and you get more. only time will tell i guess."
412377,Eazy,2009-12-16 03:31:00,260,"As of now, I've found the Berkley Fireline the best for the winter, I guess because it's ""fused"" and not ""braided""?"
412536,MooseMerch,2009-12-16 18:56:00,68,is that red coloured line?
412598,pike slayer,2009-12-16 21:35:00,1177,"i'd say bright orange, not quite red"
412795,phatfish,2009-12-17 12:31:00,7,the line was suppose to be blue. look on the front of the spool and it says blue ice. normark isn't to happy that the line color is bright orange. i don't trust  this line at all was having problems with it when i was given a sample spool in the summer just don't set the hook to hard it may blow up
