412225,johnnyb,2009-12-15 19:44:00,3413,Got my last one at LeBaron's ... that's gotta be close to 10 years ago...still have it and love it   Maybe try calling around to the smaller guys?  Angling specialties comes to mind...he has some interesting ice gear at times...
412227,irishfield,2009-12-15 19:46:00,26272,Just out of CTC.. they have the Rapala ones with the little reel on them.. but are now fiberglass and the two pronged one is now white plastic.  The only thing with steel on it was something called the super rod. It had a normal type rod with a single eye at the end.. and then a flappy spring steel leaf a bit longer than the rod that had an eye in the end of that..

412594,misfish,2009-12-16 21:32:00,29133,"I remember the ones you are talking about.The last time I seen them, was at CTC,about 3 years ago."
412603,tjsa,2009-12-16 22:09:00,1578,"It was Rhino brand that CTC sold. It appears they do not have the stainless steel line of rods any more. I have had one for 6 yrs, its great. See the pdf below for the entire Rhino lineup:  http://www.rhinofishing.com/Rhino2008.pdf"
412621,limeyangler,2009-12-16 23:29:00,5204,"Hey waterwolf, i'm pretty sure my local tackle shop carries them, i definitely saw them in either Cabelas or wholesale sports in Winnipeg. If ya like i could see what we could arrange to get one to ya if i do find them, i realise we are a ways away from each other...but where there's a will eh?"
412765,waterwolf,2009-12-17 05:39:00,556,"thanks folks for all your help, vinnimon has one and will try lebarons for a second {or maybe even a 3rd]  great site , great members .  thanks again"
