413053,irishfield,2009-12-18 00:49:00,26272,-20 or so last night so I bet it did. 4 to 6 inches of ice in our bay and the neighbour (with his leg in a cast) has been out all day packing the (future) ice road to his place and mine from town. Gotta love him....
413082,Dara,2009-12-18 02:05:00,3052,"  We stayed at Ravenscroft as well. 7 or so years ago now. My daughter and I got into eyes every night after we found them.  We were drifting over rock to a sand spot and picking them up if we could get through the rocks without a snag. She said. Dad and I looked at her rod and it was bent right over. I said great, a snag already. She looked at me with a little grin and said, nope...its tugging. I watched it for a minute and it never moved, so I said, naw, thats a snag, as it took off and pulled her hands right to the water. It was pretty neat watching her bring that thing in.  16 at the time"
413091,rangervs,2009-12-18 02:33:00,7,Stayed there two years ago fishing sucked! second week of Jan. Asked the operator to move us a few hundred yards and refused. I asked him to drill hole and he said no. I will never go to Ravencroft resort again. Service sucked!
