I'm just curious as to know if anyone on this forum has been there, or knows somebody who has, and how good the angling actually was, species caught, techniques, etc., etc....."

Its been a long time and I have been to so many of Airdales lakes that I get em mixed up. Fish it the same as you would any in this area
