412596,pike slayer,2009-12-16 21:33:00,1177,hahaha 3rd time posted atleast!! still a good video though
412601,Terry,2009-12-16 21:49:00,14456,I wasn't going to say anything but with emails I think that's the 29th time in 2 weeks I have seen it
412605,bushart,2009-12-16 22:17:00,2628,I also have received this one several times in the last week and every time it brings back the memory of the news story from many years ago from Lake Simcoe.  Apparently at that time a bunch of buddies had rented 2 huts on Simcoe----I understand that one person thought he could slip into the water in his hut and swim over and pop up in the hole of the other hut----never made it.  Maybe I'm just an old time worrier but I'd hate to think some young person would believe that sub-ice swimming is a good idea under any reason.  I just wished they had'nt made this video clip---or it should at least come with a disclaimer.  Apologies for being a wet rag here boys.  Bushart
