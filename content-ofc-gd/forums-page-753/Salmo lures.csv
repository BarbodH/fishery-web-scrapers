412351,Michael_Brown,2009-12-16 01:40:00,411,I found some today at Gannon's in Oshawa. Great little bait.

He will open up for you if he has advance notice of arrival though..."
412378,Eazy,2009-12-16 03:33:00,260,I got some from Cabelas online..

412387,perchslayer666,2009-12-16 04:01:00,280,"You can also grab some at Fishing World in Hamilton. I especially like the new holographic finishes that Salmo brough out, will work great for perch and crappies, however pike seem to like them as well..."
412394,buckster,2009-12-16 04:32:00,530,"  Indeed we do!  23rd is my last day, then the real work begins... drill,clean and jig!"
412396,farsider,2009-12-16 04:39:00,456,"www.salmoontario.com  I reccomend them and their products highly. They are a great bunch of guys. Cheers, Mark"

412466,johnnyb,2009-12-16 15:08:00,3413,"Not sure where you're located, buckster, but when I was at BassPro, I found the Lindy Darter...looks very similar to a salmo, but a nicer paint job and better looking hooks...I picked it up because it was cheaper than the Salmo. Just my $0.02...I know they're at BPS...not sure about other spots."
412486,trapshooter,2009-12-16 15:59:00,1234, I'm looking forward to trying the Lindy Darter this winter myself.  Hope to pick some up in Thunder Bay when I head down there over the holidays.
412624,buckster,2009-12-16 23:32:00,530,  Yeah im fully stocked with  those they should work well but im kinda faithful to a certain colour and size chubby D
412639,cram,2009-12-17 00:00:00,1733,"Just looked up the Linday.  Wow - what a blatant ripoff of the chubby darter.   Lindy should be ashamed.  I guess that's the fishing lure business though, huh?  btw - salmo ontario is a good site.  i bought from them last year.  Came in the mail in a few days"
412652,rhare,2009-12-17 00:53:00,387,I have all sorts of new ones kicking around still in the packages shoot me a PM with what your looking for if I have it I'll sell them cheap.
