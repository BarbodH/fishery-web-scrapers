539636,bow slayer,2011-01-15 03:44:00,1074,  empty net goals do not count towards a goalies GAA.Admitting defeat before the game is over is quitting.Playing hard to the end will build character. Not wanting  your players to give up because of the score means as a coach who must do the same.
539652,Cudz,2011-01-15 04:37:00,2652,Maybe you can show me on my post where I said empty net goals count toward the GAA.  Can you find it?  I said pulling the goalie increases the GAA.  Read carefully. There is a big difference.  I will explain later if you can't figure it out.
539654,Cudz,2011-01-15 04:54:00,2652,"Well if we are going to use your logic, then tell me why don't we see teams pulling the goalie when they are down 4 or 5 goals?  By not pulling the goalie dies it mean that they have given up?  Pulling the goalie does not mean that you are trying harder.  Building character. More than 90% of teh time when a goalie is pulled the result of the game remains the same.  A win for the team that was ahead.  The other 9+% of the time a team might tie it up when they are down by 1 goal. That % is greatly reduced when you are down by 2 goals and I have yet to see a case (especially at the nhl level) where a team has been down by 3 as the leafs were, not on the power play, and come back to tie the game. I am not sure how failing 100% of the time whilst down by 3 goals and attempting to pull the goalie builds character.  At the end of the 1 min 30 seconds you will still have lost and probably even lost worse.  NOT PULLING THE GOALIE (When your team is down by 3) DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN UP, it means that on that day your team just wasn't as good as the other.  And just for the record.  I have coached rep hockey, Senior boys' soccer, Senior Rugby, Football, Senior boys Baseball, Senior Boys Volleyball, Senior boys'  Basketball, senior level swimming, Cross country running and senior level track and field. I have also played AAA hockey and University football, University Rugby and club Rugby in Australia, England and Dubai.  I am not a quitter and have never been on a quitting team.  Building character does not come from playing hard to the end.  That shows character. If you are in the pros (which is what the original post is about), you had better already have character."
539656,Cudz,2011-01-15 05:10:00,2652,"Here is an example of how the NHL calculates GAA.   If the goalie plays a whole game and allows 2 goals, his GAA for that game is 2.00 for that 60 mins.  I am pretty sure you understand this.  Now lets say we pull the goalie with 1 minute left in the game and he has still let in 2 goals so far.  He has no longer played a full game. He has played 59 minutes but has still let in 2 goals. 59 mins is only 98.33% of a whole game.  Because he gave up 2 goals in 59 mins, his GAA is 2.03.  Even if the other team does not score, the goalies GAA still increases.   Does this make sense now? take care Cudz"
539919,bow slayer,2011-01-16 02:36:00,1074,"congrats on the coaching background ,hopefully your players were able to develop charcter when you threw in the towel. Wilson believed they were still in the game and refused to lay down which is a good sign to his players that he believed in them,kudos to him. I played Jr. hockey my son now plays Jr. i coached AAA for 5 years so I can appreciate what Wilson was doing and would of done the same myself,even thou I hate the leafs I love when a coach  coaches to the final buzzer no matter what the score."
539949,Cudz,2011-01-16 04:37:00,2652,"Never threw in the towel, ever.  I just finished watching the NFC game GB vs ATL.  Under two minutes left and a 4th down to Atlanta who are losing and they...................wait for it..................punt the ball.  Their coach Smith, might be coach of the year.  Too bad they threw in the towel.  He deserves to be fired!!! PS  Did you understand how a goalie's GAA can increases if he is pulled?"
540011,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-16 14:02:00,0,is the pissing contest done yet?  who pee'd further?
539201,Cudz,2011-01-14 04:38:00,2652,"I totally understand pulling the goalie when you are down by 1 goal with a minute or a minute and a half left in the game.  I can even (but just barely) wrap my head around pulling the goalie when you are down by 2 goals.  I just watched the end of the leafs' game and they are down 4 - 1 and decide to pull the goaklie with 1min 30 left.  Maybe it is just me and I am not being an optimist but come on, really?  Am I missing something here? And yes, Phoenix scored an empty netter to make it 5 to 1.  I just don't get it.  Losing by 3 or losing by 4 I guess makes no difference."
539203,PikeMolester,2011-01-14 04:45:00,428,no difference between losing by 3 or 4. Its a pretty bonehead move...but I guess he wanted to show he's fighting to the very end and maybe something magical will happen as opposed to sitting back and accepting defeat.
539205,richyb,2011-01-14 04:47:00,774,3 goals in 1:30 is do-able.
539206,alphaalpha,2011-01-14 05:03:00,475,maybe just for the real game practice of pulling the goalie...it's probably difficult to actually simulate that feeling of really not wanting to have that empty netter scored against you.  That and the pressure of NEEDING to score in that final minute.
539208,jjcanoe,2011-01-14 05:14:00,744,maybe Wilson should have offered $601 for the winner!
539217,vince.bornais,2011-01-14 11:05:00,50,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about. If you're watching the leafs, you've already decided you're not that interested in hockey anyway!!!"
539244,skeeter,2011-01-14 12:58:00,1907," Rich, really need to read the post first, there talking about the leafs!"
539248,Rod Caster,2011-01-14 13:13:00,5784,"Toronto needs six skaters to even have a chance against PHX.  Go PHX Go! Thanks for the two points, Leafs!  "
539251,corvette1,2011-01-14 13:22:00,1765,boston got 3 in 2.21 in pitt the other night 5-1 or 10-1 its a loss might just as well go for it
539285,Mike Pike,2011-01-14 14:24:00,1332,"They scored 4 goals during a 5 minute power play against the Thrashers so giving yourself an extra man advantage to try and score 3 goals is not out of the question.  Not probable but possible, so why not try?  4-1 or 5-1, what's the difference."
539306,Cudz,2011-01-14 15:23:00,2652,Really??????  I don't believe this is possible.  All these situations of possibilities you people are coming up with occur when a team in on the powerplay or at equal strength.  I would like to see a team score 3 goals without a goalie in their own net.  The leafs were not on a powerplay at the end of the game so it 6 on 5. I can't find any historical evidence that 3 goals have been scored by a team in the last minute and a half with their goalie pulled.
539317,Mike Pike,2011-01-14 15:47:00,1332,"So, what you're saying is that there's a greater possibility of scoring 3 goals in a minute and a half WITHOUT pulling your goalie?  You may be right."
539321,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-14 15:53:00,0,"there's no reason not to pull the goalie.  coaches generally endorse the 'never quit' attitude, and typically to get players to buy into anything you have to lead by example.  there's a slight chance you can tie the game, and if you're that convinced you have no chance to win, it's still good for practice. skating drills don't really prepare you for the actual pressure of the moment when you got a man up and an empty net."
539322,Cudz,2011-01-14 15:54:00,2652,NOPE! What I am saying is that there is a lower possibility of scoring three goals in a row without having the other team get even 1 shot (which would result in a goal) against your net.  I can find many situtions in the past where a team has scored 3 goals in less thn 1 min 30 secs but have yet to find that same result with the goalie pulled.
539324,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-14 15:56:00,390,"I don' t know, the Russians scored 2 goals in 13 seconds against the Canadian Juniors.  Also, if puck pressure is enough the defensive team could take a penalty for delay of game (shooting over glass from defensive zone) or a stick penalty."
539334,Mike Pike,2011-01-14 16:20:00,1332,"Ya, that's what I said Cudz.  I'm actually agreeing with you now."
539351,Cudz,2011-01-14 16:59:00,2652,"Yeah sorry, I realized that after I reread your reply"
539368,uglyfish,2011-01-14 17:51:00,981,"having an extra skater will give the team an advantage. howeve,  as we see its a risky move should they get an empty netter. ive seen teams score 2 goals within a minute with the goalie pulled, so 3 could be done as well, though i opersonally dont ever remember seeing it done. but not many times will they pull the goalie down 3. only wilson knows why he did it. but bottom line, whether u lose by 1 goal or 10 goals.... u still lost. goal differential means nothing in the NHL, except bragging rights.  as with anything... if they did score the 3 and tie it up, not only would it be historical, but everyone would be praising wilson for pulling it off."
539372,bow slayer,2011-01-14 18:00:00,1074,"I have coached alot of rep hockey the last 10 years and you never accept defeat until the game is over. What is the difference losing 4-1 or 5-1,send the message to the players that you play to the end no matter what the score is other wise you are a quitter."
539376,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-14 18:09:00,0,

539429,Fang,2011-01-14 19:48:00,1330,sometimes its more about the message you send as a coach
539518,Cudz,2011-01-14 23:42:00,2652,"I didn't but if I were a gambler and I did, I would be irate."
539521,Cudz,2011-01-14 23:46:00,2652,"You have coached a lot of rep hockey and I have played a lot of rep hockey.  Not pulling the goalie when you are down by 3 with just over a minute left does not mean that you are a quitter. The difference between 5-1 and 4-1 is 1.  But losing 4-1 sounds like you  might have been in teh game, 5-1 not so much. Plus it makes the goalies GAA increase when they get pulled."
