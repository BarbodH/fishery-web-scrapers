539982,Rich Clemens,2011-01-16 11:58:00,3131,Certainly not your usual shore-line fishing.  I'm assuming thats ICE built up along the shoreline you guys had to contend with.  Looks like you guys had great weather and the fish were hungry.  Can't get much better than that.   Thanks for sharing.
539985,ChrisK,2011-01-16 12:12:00,2772,"12p, You guys had a beautiful day and those pics,well they are just breath taking. The second one especially with the big arch in the pole and the background scenery. Looks like it needs to be on the front of a magazine.  Cheers !"
539987,spincast,2011-01-16 12:22:00,3279,"Wow - awesome day - those are some sweet fish. I haven't done that climb yet, but I hear its quite the energy burner even in good weather - how was it with ice and snow climbing up / down there. ? I really got to get out there one day soon."
539992,splashhopper,2011-01-16 12:42:00,2931,awesome...... I love the second pic....
540013,Rod Caster,2011-01-16 14:11:00,5784,that second pic is Epic! Nice Laker and what ever else those other trout are.  
540017,Grimace,2011-01-16 14:23:00,2020,Awesome.   Action shots rule.
540019,bushart,2011-01-16 14:26:00,2628,Beauty shots---looks a little dicey on the footing in some spots--but good goin
540103,l2p,2011-01-16 17:52:00,346,"Thanks for the awsome words guys! much appreaciated.  it was deffinatly a beautiful day to be out, at one point we even started to sweat from the beating sun haha maybe even got a sun burn. the shore line is caked with ice and you certainly should pick your footing, we fell through a couple of soft spots but we never ventured out on ice over the water. not as crazy as those guys fishing 3 inches of ice on simcoe if u ask me =) as for the climb it wasnt too bad for us cause there was already previous foot traffic so we just followed the foot prints, i could picture it being a crazy walk down if it were all fresh powder snow.  heres a couple more action shots for ya guys!     "
540113,Leecher,2011-01-16 18:11:00,7832,"Great report and excellent pics l2p Loved the rod bend shot..... truly spectacular Like others said, it should be on the front of a magazine for sure Terry aka bushart..... take the brush out, you have some great material to work with here Great job you two and thanks for sharing!!!
