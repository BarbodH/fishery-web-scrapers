539452,alphaalpha,2011-01-14 20:53:00,475,Anyone know the thickness of ice on the deeper areas.  I am thinking about heading up there tomorrow and was hoping to go for lakers/whiteys but I am not too brave when it comes to thinner ice.  Should i just stick to perch/pike for now and give it more time to thicken up?  Any advice here or via pm would be greatly appreciated.  -Alphaalpha.
539456,richyb,2011-01-14 21:04:00,774,I hear that people are going out off innisfil on 4-5 inches of ice but i havent been there myself. On the west side around oro there is only a couple inches and it needs another week.
539458,alphaalpha,2011-01-14 21:06:00,475,Ya I was thinking about heading up to oro to check it out but I will stay clear of it and not waste the trip that far up.  Thanks for the quick reply!

All but one perch survived to be caught another day. The one that didn't was the one I brought up too quick and I think it got the ""bends"", it went belly up in the hole and never made it back down."

Talked to a couple of guys coming in, Shale type ice west of Fox, one guy chipped thru 3 inches west of Snake. Bear Point area 4 to 5 inches of MILKY ice. A 30 plus year local parked his machine at the edge and walked out to the centre. Approx. 5 inches but some spots fluctuated between 4 and 6, but again not black ice. This again was in the Bear Point area."
