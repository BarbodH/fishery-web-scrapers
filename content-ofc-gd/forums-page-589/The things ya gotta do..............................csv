539574,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-15 01:44:00,10439,to do a little barbequing at -40!!! Seems propane doesn't vaporize too well when the temps are a little nippy. Had to fire up the 1500 watt electric heater to warm the olde propane bottle. One pounders are easier to warm up than the 20 pounders.

539588,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-15 02:02:00,10439,"  It's ok, it's a dry cold. You do get used to the cold though."
539594,spincast,2011-01-15 02:12:00,3279,-40?  sounds like you takeit off the grill and it would be freeze dried before it hit the bun You're a dedicated BBQ man Dave  fresh fish I hope?
539613,nofish4me,2011-01-15 02:42:00,404,"Too lazy to look it up, but if I recall, -40Â°F vapour pressure is 0 psig(or damned close)."
539655,toca,2011-01-15 05:08:00,274,hows that portable bbq?  wondering how it fares out for 40 bucks.
539665,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-15 06:01:00,10439,  It's actually pretty decent for the $$$ My last bbq was similar but stainless and 2 1/2 times the price and this one cooks more evenly but the paint on the lid is starting to get burned looking already.
539678,Fishnwire,2011-01-15 11:50:00,983,"Drifter...I hope you don't mind if I ask something a little off topic.  Most aerosol cans and paint labels I've seen say ""keep from freezing"".  I have an unheated shed which I go through in the fall and remove things like that to a heated environment.  I see you don't seem to worry about that too much.  If you can get away with it with the length/intensity of winter you get up there, I shouldn't have to worry about it down here, right?  Or are those empty cans under the bench in that pic?  Just curious...thanks."
539797,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-15 19:12:00,10439, Nope they're not empty. The only things you need to bring inside would be water based or if it says keep from freezing on the can.
