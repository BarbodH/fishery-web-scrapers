Was good to see him catch some fish, kept a few also.  We were fisshing small 1"" minnows off bottom and sometimes a foot under the ice. Water depth ranged from 6.8-7.2 ft for the most part.  Two biggest was a 11.5 and a 12...still haven't got my 13""+ but I got lot's of time.  Enjoy the pictures  Tightlines everybody, MTBF"
