537159,Billy Bob,2011-01-09 21:11:00,5865, I agree with the above post for inland lakes but NOT Lake Erie where many Canadian commercial fishing boats take perch and walleyes by the thousands......we need to find a fair and balance answer when it comes to Lake Erie.
537253,Fish Farmer,2011-01-10 01:22:00,2234,"That would be my thought. They sell yellow Perch and Walleye at Fortinos, Sobeys, Metro. Don't need a license to buy. I can see this is one of those hard to prove issues. I did reply on that other site."
537267,skeeter,2011-01-10 01:46:00,1907,"if a person with a conservation license is NOT allowed to posses a muskie, then why would a person without a license be allowed to have one in there possession????????  thats like saying a person without a drivers license is allowed to drive a tractor trailer.  no license no possesion.  as per an mnr officer that i asked, if your kid under 18 is fishing with you then there limit is the same as yours, be it conservation or sport depending on what you have."
537275,Terry,2011-01-10 02:05:00,14456," and that is the problem with the COs, they don't know their own regs  as per an mnr officer that i asked, if your kid under 18 is fishing with you then there limit is the same as yours, be it conservation or sport depending on what you have.  that is 100% wrong for Ontario residents"
537277,irishfield,2011-01-10 02:12:00,26272,"Just remember folks that EVERY Ontario citizen needs a fishing licence to fish whether your're 2 or 80 ! If you are 18 and under or a day over 65 you must have sufficient proof of age with you and that is considered to be your fishing licence, as is a handicap permit for anyone in between. If you can't prove whom you are or how old you are... you will be charged with fishing without a licence.  If I remember correctly.. out of province anglers fishing with someone under 18.. their catch counts against your limit unless they have their own licence. There is no exemption for those over 65 from out of province. I don't have a reg book in front of me....."
537288,Terry,2011-01-10 02:38:00,14456, I also believe that....  and that's why I said for Ontario residents cause I knew someone would bring up the nonresident card....LOL
537406,Woodsman,2011-01-10 14:05:00,1286,Actually incorrect. Canadian residents under 18 or 65 and over are treated the same as Ontario Residents as far as licences. Non Ontario and Non Canadian residents are different. Those under 18 may fish without a licence as long as they are with a licenced angler. Their catch is part of the licenced anglers catch and possession limit. An option for the non resiident under 18 is to buy a licence & have their own limit. Also available to them may be a Non-Canadian resident angling Licence for a Member of an Organized Camp. Non-Canadians 65 & older are required to purchase a licence for Non-Canadian Residents.
539036,nother1,2011-01-13 22:49:00,2,"The point of this thread has gone off topic. is a person without a license restricred to limits on how much fish he / she can be given? All fish are caught by licensed angler obeying daily limits and posession limits etc. and then given to someone who doesnt fish. Not for storage or anything else, but given away never to be consumed or seen by you again.And if ssuch a reg exists reference it for verification.This is to verify how only people who follow the rules are subjected to different rules the those who don't pay the fees we do for our hobby and then get snubbed by people for our hobby because its creul."
539044,mercman,2011-01-13 23:02:00,7054,"  sorry, i lost your meaning after ""verification""."
539229,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 11:36:00,5865,"So I go up to God's Country in northern Ontario and catch my limit of walleyes......I then give said walleyes to my wife who doesn't have a fishing license and continue to fish each and everyday for a week, thus repeatedly give my limit to my wife and she and I are legal..  ..on the way home we are stopped....now who goes to jail....her, me, both or no one...  I think I just found a loop hole on how I can get free room and board in Ontario....  ....is the jail near a lake...  Bob"
539232,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 11:44:00,5865,"Another way is that my son and his girlfriend are staying in the cottage next door and I give said walleyes to them as neither of them have fishing licenses, nor fish.....are they legal to now transport the fish back to the USA and then give them back to me..."

539239,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 12:46:00,2690,"Thought this one was finished, but, still some good points being made.  It does get you thinking, and, yeah it really sucks that it provides a sort of ""loophole"" for those who don't follow the regulations. I originally found this question on a great local forum, where many target Lake Erie perch.  Great bunch of guys, many or whom are on this forum, as well.  However, there are alot of fishermen down that way, that go out many times a week...are they keeping too many fish, not for me to say.  One thing that does get me riled up is it seems the ones that fish the most (and usually keep the most) are the first ones to complain when the fishery goes in the toilet."
539373,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-14 18:00:00,835,"The regs were there before the licensing so that might be why they might seem a little off.  Regs were to protect the fishery, licensing is an unrelated  money grab, conservation licensing is a trick to get support for the money grab and not make it look not so much like a money grab by sugar coating it.  Before licensing your catch and possession limit was the same but never enforced. If your limit was 4 fish, that was your catch limit, didn't matter if you threw em back or gave them away or ate em you were allowed to catch 4 then go home or target something else.  Unlimited catch fishing or C+R Was promoted in the 70's to help the tourist and sport fishing industry when the fish were no longer edible due to pollution . With fishing going from a food gathering system to a sport industry,  the regs might not be in sink.  You can give fish away to someone without a license because fishing is illegal, not possessing fish."

539979,nother1,2011-01-16 11:39:00,2,Ok then I'm going out on a limb and assume that if I have a full license then that person can posess a full limit. It does make sense so that a person can't stock pile fish.
536976,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-09 13:22:00,2690,"Just wondering if there is a limit of how much fish a person can have in there possesion if they are not a fisher person. i e if i gave my neighbour my daily limit of perch could he accept more and store them in his freezer? I'm not looking to break any laws it is a hypothectical question. Is there limititaions on game given to you, that is caught leagally. As if I'd ever give away all of my hard caught booty. lol Just interested in your opoin on this topic since there is nothing in the regs   This question got me thinking, did a quick google search, look at the regs...didn't come up with a definitive answer.  I'm sure many of us have given a fish or two to friends or family that don't participate in our beloved sport.  When does this push over the line, or become a loophole for those that wish to abuse limits??  Things that make you go, hmmmmmmmmmmm"
536978,Terry,2011-01-09 13:26:00,14456,they would have a sport license limit
536984,Woodsman,2011-01-09 14:14:00,1286,Although I believe Terry is correct I feel it should be a conservation licence limit. Why should they be allowed to possess more fish than someone who actually paid for a (Conservation)licence?
536987,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-09 14:22:00,2690," Yeah, did a bit more looking myself.  Think Terry is correct as well, but I totally agree with your point.  One of the replies on the ""other forum"" stated that the non-fisher was to record who gave them the fish, as well as the date they were received.  Obviously the best way to find the correct answer would be to contact the ministry...although they have given conflicting answers on questions before..."
536990,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-09 14:29:00,4399,"There are other forums  A non license holder would be subject to the same rules and regulations as a license holder and that would be on the conservation side, I can imagine what some unscrupulous    would be thinking hey my brother or dad don`t fish so I can just keep piling fish in their freezer!"
536991,Rod Caster,2011-01-09 14:29:00,5784,"I called the MNR a while ago and asked them the same question...  The non-licensed person, like Terry said, has the same possession and daily limits as a sport license allows. The fish you give away also count against your daily catch limit."
536993,Terry,2011-01-09 14:32:00,14456,"I too do not agree with the regs on this  I think that you should not be allowed to give ""fish"" to people without a license but rather they should be allowed to give only ""prepared fish""  they don't need to be cooked but I think they should be cleaned and packaged to the point of being ready to be cooked, and they should not only count against your daily limit but should be your possession limit, till they have been consumed...  isn't going to happen but"
536997,didoban,2011-01-09 14:40:00,65,"It only state the possession limit for those that have the fishing license. It doesn't state possession limit for non-licenced person. Since it is not stated in Ministry, the non-licensed person can accept and keep as many fish as that person want.  If you gave your fish away and you have less than allowable limit in your possession, then you're good to go. I don't condone it and subject to abuse, but that is the way it is written.  It should be revised.  This is only my opinion, and how I see it."
536998,johnnyb,2011-01-09 14:40:00,3413,"Please don't take this as hijiacking the thread...what about someone who is fishing with you that doesn't need a license because of their age?  My 10 year old son, for example.... or my 67 year old dad....do they have their own sport limit, or do their fish count toward mine? *Edit*  I got off my lazy  and took the ten steps over to my copy of the regs and see that my son and my dad are ""deemed to be the holder of a recreational fishing license"" and have to follow the same rules as the sport license."
537000,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-09 14:43:00,2690,"    This becomes one of those things that becomes almost impossible to ""police"".  All comes down to ethics, I guess.  Figured it would make some good ""winter fodder"" for those of us who aren't/can't be on the water today."
537007,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-09 14:53:00,4399,"Like I said there are always people out there looking for an angle to satisfy their own greed and yes your right the ministry probably should address it in and every other possible loophole in the regs,the booklet will probably be the size of an encyclopedia but so be it!  The question was referencing a non fisherman not a person that was not required to have a license."
537009,Terry,2011-01-09 14:56:00,14456, I believe it is stated in the fishing regs  just not in the summary with is what almost every person reads the regs are 1000s of pages
537012,JohnF,2011-01-09 15:03:00,3494,"Is there really a problem here? I for one just turned 65 and will be license free this year but I have no intention of changing my ""keep"" practises just because I'm not paying. I doubt for the puny difference in what we pay for the choice of licenses (and keep) we'd have gone the cheap route simply for the money saved. I seldom take fish home. In fact the only fish I keep are the injured ones and they get used, either by me or by friends. They're never wasted.  I'll admit I'm not a meat hunter although if the opportunity arose I'd like to try a feed of fresh caught walleye. I've never caught one to be honest, unless it was as a kid with my Dad. I don't plan to change my fishing travel habits just to decimate the walleye population though.  So I guess I'm saying this discussion is probably moot. Those who kept meat before will continue and those who didn't probably won't start. As for the no fee deal I guess that's open to debate but tradition dictates that us old farts get a few breaks. I don't feel guilty though. I've paid lots of taxes and gov't fees throughout my life. Maybe I've earned a break and a little encouragement to enjoy my so-far-not-happening-thru-personal-choice retirement. I'm not hard up but a lot of folks my vintage just weren't able to set aside much of a retirement fund, often thru no fault of their own uless you're being a real hardass with them, and they will have to forego a lot of the pleasures life has to offer due to the cost of having fun. Perhaps we shouldn't begrudge them this one simple natural pleasure.  Respectfully JF"
537017,Terry,2011-01-09 15:16:00,14456,"  I think it was directed at people who do not fish do not have a license , because they don't fish but would be over 18 and under 65  and receive fish from fishermen  that's how I took it"
537023,Tomcat,2011-01-09 15:28:00,395,"Every Ontario resident is entitled to a possession limit of whatever species regardless whether they have a fishing licence or not. The only caveat as I understand the current interpretation from one Conservation Officer, is that the person receiving the possession limit must be old enough to understand that they have received a possession limit and from whom. Consequently, I can legally give my own possession limit of walleye to my neighbour, my wife, my daughter or whomever. And once given, the number of walleye in my own possession is reduced to zero. The daily catch limit is not impacted by giving fish away. And no, this is NOT written anywhere within Ontario's fishing regulations."
537027,JohnF,2011-01-09 15:36:00,3494," Sorry. I caught some of that talk but must have missed the real point. Is there a connection between age and giving away the catch though?  I remember meeting an interesting feller working at a Dick's Store in Cleveland who admitted that he was a meat fisherman thru and thru and not for fun. He had a trail of ex-wives and young families (a story in itself) that he was helping support and free fish was a huge part of the extended family diet. In his case though by the time he's retired his extended families will be self-sufficent. At least I hope they will be for his sake.  And given the difficult financial circumstances some oldsters find themselves in post-retirement I'm not sure I could be too critical of fishermen who try to help them out with some fresh free meat. As long as the resources are being treated responsibly I like to see folks living off the land, or water as it were.  JF"
537034,Terry,2011-01-09 15:44:00,14456," I believe it is if you give them away you can not go back out that day and catch more fish as you have already caught and keep your limit  if you caught and gave away 2 fish then for that day if you go back fishing, your daily limit is 2 less for that day"
537050,Woodsman,2011-01-09 16:44:00,1286,I agree but my problem is those with a conservation licence are restricted to conservation limits but those (18-64) who have paid ZERO $ & don't fish are allowed the larger sport fish limits.
537061,brifishrgy,2011-01-09 18:06:00,559,"  buy a sport license then, problem gone"
537065,Terry,2011-01-09 18:13:00,14456,the ontario gov sees it a different way   everyone can fish without a license and with a full limit     except people from the age of 18 to 64 who have to pay to fish  and if you mostly release your fish they give you a break with conservation license that cost less with lower limits  nice of them yeah    LOL
537070,tb4me,2011-01-09 18:30:00,3295,Interesting subject..Here's a good question..every year when the ice is among us I like to go to the Port dover fish market and stocck up on waleye.. This fall i spent over $75.00 in waleye filets. We brought them home and froze thel all. The question is am I breaking the law in my posession limits? Sure hope not..YIKES! May have to get eating if thats the case.
537081,Terry,2011-01-09 18:45:00,14456,store bought fish have no bearing on on you fishing limits or possession limit
537090,Tomcat,2011-01-09 19:35:00,395," Perhaps its just my poor writing construction Terry. Regardless whether I give my walleye possession limit away or not, I can not legally catch and keep more walleye on one day than my daily catch limit. That's why I stated that the daily catch limit was not impacted by giving fish away.  I'd like to make a second point. Not everyone can legally fish without a licence and with a full limit. While residents under 18 or residents 65 or older don't require a fishing licence to fish, those between 18 and 64 years of age do unless they satisfy some other exemption."
537097,Terry,2011-01-09 19:45:00,14456,YES CORRECT ON BOTH POINTS
537098,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-09 19:47:00,2690,Some great points being made...didn't realise I was giving Terry an all day project when I posted this   Next time let's just go fishing!!!!!
