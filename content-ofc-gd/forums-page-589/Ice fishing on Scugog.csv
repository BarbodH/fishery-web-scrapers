539579,GBW,2011-01-15 01:52:00,8460,I going to have everyone park on the other side of the road @ # 8 as he's away...
539602,skeeter,2011-01-15 02:18:00,1907, my skunk is over sweet cheeks! had a feast of perch last night and it was good!
539642,GBW,2011-01-15 04:09:00,8460,"SHHHH!!, I don't want a bunch of ppl asking to come out of the ice with me cause of that name!  Oh it's all good ""jail-bird"" (the sripes count) just saying..."
539838,GBW,2011-01-15 21:27:00,8460,"Update, people coming are as follows: CCMT, lazlo, Fishnsled and maybe Johnnyd.  Anyone have sleds or ATV's to get out on the ice with all this new snow?  LOL!"
537508,GBW,2011-01-10 19:27:00,8460,"I had some free time this weekend so I decided to hook up with a friend (young_one)and do some ice fishing.  He got there before noon and set up after finding a good weed edge.  I told him I would join him for the evening bite so, I get there at 4:00PM.  As I walk up to his hut I see 1 keeper (in the 2011 zone 17 reg's) walley, a jumbo perch and a black crappie on the ice.  He hears me and stick's his hand out from under the zipper door and says ""you want a crappie?"" (joking) holding a fish the same size of his hand.  Back it went to live another day...  I get all set up and ready to go in search of walleye.  I look over at his under water camera and see a bunch of panfish so my plans quickly change.  I have never targeted black crappie before on the ice so yesterday was a first for me, crappie through the ice.  We landed a bunch with only a few 'slabs' thrown into the mix.  I will say this though, if you haven't fished for them, use an ultralight ice rod and small bait.  Now I cannot wait to get back out there and target some crappie again as they put up a good fight under the ice.  Cheers.  I'm sure Will can add any pic's or video's he made too.  Geoff"
537511,Victor,2011-01-10 19:44:00,1609,"Sounds like you guys had a decent trip.  didn't fare so well myself, only got a bunch of small perch and frozen fingers/toes"
537517,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-10 19:51:00,1351,Get a heater victor  I just got one over the weekend. Worked great in the hut(the eskimo hut fits in the honda!). Should've came out to Gilford. I found a spot(gps-ed ) that has some aggressive perch.. haha.
537525,Terry,2011-01-10 20:04:00,14456,nice going  I have not gone after crappie on the ice in a few years......... but I love watching the underwater camera
537680,Gregoire,2011-01-11 00:19:00,1397,Nice report. I wandered around Scugog on Sunday but got skunked.
537697,GBW,2011-01-11 00:46:00,8460,"Thanks guys. If I get a pass from the Boss I'm going to head out again on Sunday.  I know a few people wanting to get out, LOL"
537717,skeeter,2011-01-11 01:20:00,1907,Way to go on the fishing to both of you. i was out on simcoe for the weekend and im heading back out there again tomorrow. heading out with someone from this board that i have never met--yet. gotta love the people on this board! 
537812,GBW,2011-01-11 03:31:00,8460,"Dann, BRING THE TAZER!!!! just kidding, or am I... Have fun and post a report. BTW, I think I may be 'hosting' an un-offical G2G on 'the bog' this Sunday if all goes well. To those that I have talked to via PM recently about ice fishing, this weekend may turn into a G2G of sorts...  LOL  I will play it by ear as the week goes on."
537907,GBW,2011-01-11 13:34:00,8460,so after talking to the boss Sunday afternoon/evening might work to get out again...  only time will tell...
538654,Leecher,2011-01-13 02:09:00,7832,Crappies can be fun to catch when they turn on and can find them Sounds like a fun time for you two Geoff Thanks for sharing Jacques
538817,daryl0815,2011-01-13 15:06:00,225,"Definitely sounds like a good few hours on Scug, crappie and walleye can be hard to find out there, tiny perch are everywhere lol.  I went there a few times last winter on the east side near caeseria, and only caught a few dink perch!  I am seeking some walleye for sure this year, this cold weather definitely makes fishing tough for me though. I havent been able to invest in a hut yet, maybe once I am back to work and they clear them out in the spring time!"
539200,GBW,2011-01-14 04:28:00,8460,"SSSSHHH!!!!  So I have the green light to do an evening fish on Sunday.  Who's in?  This way we can start a post to see where we want to meet and when.  Send email's to [emailÂ protected] to be added to the 'chat'.  Right now thinking Goreski's (did I spell it right) to be easy to find.  If we have a LOT of replies I will see what we can do for the $10.00 per car parking.  My uncle has the chip truck at 7A and Island Rd so maybe we can park (depending on the amount of people) at his house and make a run or two back out to the ice.  His house is closer to Goreski's then the chip truck.  I cannot be on the ice prior to 3PM due to other plans if anyone wants to get out and fish.  To keep the board safe and clean...  This has NOTHING to do with this board (OFC)!  This is just an open invite as I'm going fishing and if you want to come, it's up to you.  Got Insurance?  LOL"
539258,skeeter,2011-01-14 13:40:00,1907,why hasnt yonge_one piped in at all on this thread? did he go 0for0 again?
539282,GBW,2011-01-14 14:22:00,8460,"far from O-for. Ok, so CCMT and I are in (I only have a 2 man hut) is anyone else?"
539287,ccmtcanada,2011-01-14 14:31:00,7971,I call a spot in the hut if it's freezing...LOL.  I'll be in touch GBW!
539295,Headhunter,2011-01-14 15:06:00,5703,Get ready for the skunk GBW! LMAO HH
539308,ccmtcanada,2011-01-14 15:26:00,7971, Who asked you???? JEEZ!!!!  Shouldn't you be working or something?
539313,limeyangler,2011-01-14 15:41:00,5204,"Good on ya GBW....ive never had much joy with Crappie on the ice, go get 'em then share all the info with me"
539320,GBW,2011-01-14 15:53:00,8460,"So far it's me, CCMT and lazlo meeting at my place for 3:00 PM and carpooling. I have one 2 man hut, 3 folding chairs, heater, 4 combo's and 1 tip up.  pack small bait's and if you want minnows, get some as I'm out.  Simon (limey) look at the video's young_one posted as that was the go to bait we used."
539323,GBW,2011-01-14 15:55:00,8460,"he's asked me to reply to this because he's so busy.  oh and he said it takes him a 1/2 day to do a full days work.  OH and this just added as I type ""if skeeter comes there might as well be a whole hurd of skunks on the ice""."
539332,young_one,2011-01-14 16:12:00,620,"Sorry guys, can't go on Sunday. I'm either working or playing in basketball tournament.  Good luck to you all! Find the weed edge, you'll find the fish!"
539342,frozen-fire,2011-01-14 16:40:00,542,This is tempting
539343,GBW,2011-01-14 16:44:00,8460,feel free to join.  I know you know where to get the minnows...
539347,ccmtcanada,2011-01-14 16:53:00,7971,Does the causeway have minnows?  Can we stop there on the way?
539371,GBW,2011-01-14 17:59:00,8460,yes we can stop if u want to
