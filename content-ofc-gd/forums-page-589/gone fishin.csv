539160,fishcrisp,2011-01-14 03:02:00,17,im sure its not frozen over... just cast between the chunks
539163,BillM,2011-01-14 03:08:00,17367,"The whirlpool freezes? lol  I'd be looking at the winds the past week to see if Erie has stirred up. If it has, the river will be blown."
539166,canadadude,2011-01-14 03:11:00,769,"It never freezes completly but it can be dangerous when the ice forms along shore, if conditions are tough there Queenston is a better option and easilly accessable,only 10min down river from the pool. Port Dalhousie in St Catharines is another option in the winter and is fishable all winter, it also dosn't suffer the dirty water as bad in the winter especailly with Welland Canal closed for the season. Port D doesn't get blown out in the winter"
539194,SlowPoke,2011-01-14 04:09:00,2984,As of today Queenston was pretty green but lots of ice flows. Shorelines looked pretty chunky. I'll have a look tomorrow too.
539236,Cast Adventures,2011-01-14 12:04:00,74,"  Heads up!  The ice in the lower river yesterday was really bad! the pool......packed!! water looks good tho! nice green. i'd save the gas $ unless something changes today with the conditions....i've fished in icy conditions before, but this is bad!! some spots you'd normaly fish, are iced right over! The ice is not safe! ps: current water temps are 33.......  no boats out....too much ice, again......  winds for this weekend look bad too.....that time of year  really need erie to lock up! shouldn't be long....."

539583,canadadude,2011-01-15 01:59:00,769,"Hey Port Dalhousie is clear of ice and the water is 6-8' vis really clear, if you want to fish no problem, the fish are lower in the harbour, the Pavilion is agood choice, PM me I'll try to give you some details if you want"
539669,Cast Adventures,2011-01-15 09:53:00,74, Ice was gone yesterday afternoon!! Things change fast tho! Good luck!
