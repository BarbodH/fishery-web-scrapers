539453,Big Cliff,2011-01-14 20:57:00,6899,"The people on this board never cease to amaze me. I recently sold my AquaVu to Wayne. He made me an offer that I accepted, the deal was that I would pay the freight. The cheque arrived today and he had added in the cost of the freight, his reasoning: I'd be ripping you off if I didn't cover the freight! Now that is a class act!!!!! Most other people would have just smiled as they put the extra money in their pocket.  A true gentleman as always Wayne! Thank you!"

539460,irishfield,2011-01-14 21:09:00,26272,Dang Cliff.. you're embarrassing me! Now tell them the whole story... How about someone shipping you something and saying mail me a cheque if you like it??? The thing is mint.. 1/2 the DISCOUNTED retail price... has never seen the ice.. no wear and tear.. only used as a bedroom security camera... How could I not pay for the postage!!!
