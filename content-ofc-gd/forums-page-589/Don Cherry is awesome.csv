540018,bushart,2011-01-16 14:23:00,2628,This is a very tragic case.

540063,Old Man,2011-01-16 16:12:00,822,"Just watched Don's tribute, and he mentions the justice system for 4 seconds of a 1 minute 53 second tribute, and what he says in that 4 seconds is probably the way it will end up going down. So I don't see how this can be classified and a rant against the justice system or political grandstanding. Good job Don."
540065,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-16 16:14:00,0,"pretty sad when you can't share an opinion on a controversial person that's completely on topic, not rude in any way, and respectful to the other posters...  thinkpol is watching."
540066,fish_fishburn,2011-01-16 16:15:00,1311,"Same here, just teasing you Doc. Grapes is what Grapes is, and I find him quite entertaining.  Not saying I agree with everything he says, but he's alot more entertaining then most of the games now days that are played in the NHL."
540088,tb4me,2011-01-16 16:56:00,3295,Grapes can be an ass at times.. When it comes to Hockey the man knows his stuff thats for sure. Has a huge heart for our troops and police officers..God love the man for that!
540098,irishfield,2011-01-16 17:39:00,26272,  Yep... he'll be living just around the corner from me Old Man.. satelitte TV.. outdoor hockey rink.. indoor pool and basketball courts.. the whole thing sucks.  Condolences to the officers family.
540100,bushart,2011-01-16 17:42:00,2628,Or we can think outside the box for one second...  How's about that the OP is a police officer and I'm pretty sure this is an emotional issue for all those that serve.  So in a form of expression on this issue he posts the link that talks about this tragedy---I don't know maybe it's therapeutic in some form or another--but all that aside We should allow him the respect to do this as we all would receive.  To take this thread and use it for bashing a celebrity who does not share your political beliefs is not cool and shows disrespect for the OP's opinion in a difficult time.
540110,fishing n autograph,2011-01-16 18:04:00,2540,"okay, well i guess everyone took this post the wrong way. I meant that his tribute was awesome.  Next time i'll think twice about posting anything that isn't fishing related....even posting a comment will take a second thought.  Thanks gentlemen, have a good day"
540112,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-16 18:10:00,0,it's a tragedy and the guy responsible should spend his life in a cell. i assure you i meant no disrespect to yourself or any of the fallen don speaks about.  i can't explain further without being moderated.  RIP
540123,cram,2011-01-16 18:42:00,1733,It was an awesome tribute. You can hear it in his voice as well. Really sad what happened to that young family.
