Willow had approx 6-8 inches of ice out to where I fished, maybe 20-25 FOW.  I'd say probably more ice at Sibald because it's more sheltered.  I caught around 30 but kept only 6 9+ inches.  I used to fish Sibald alot but it seemed not too productive for me in the last 5 years, maybe I'll try it again."
