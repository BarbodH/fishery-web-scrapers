537543,scugpg,2011-01-10 20:25:00,1373,Guys I'm looking for a flip over shelter that I can pull around by hand that will fit 2 people. Doesn't have to be huge but want one bigger than a 1 man that will also fit in the car.  Is there any oversized 1 mans other than the shappell 1.5 or a small profile 2 man around? Having a tough time finding a 2 man that's under 80lbs and small profile.  Thanks.
537544,GBW,2011-01-10 20:28:00,8460,have you looked at a Clam 2000?  I have one and it works well.  I think it's under 50LB too.  It fit's in the back of my car with the rear seats down.
537551,mike rousseau,2011-01-10 20:41:00,4661,I have a clam fish trap pro and I've had my girlfriend in there with me.... It's a large one man flip over and it may fit into a car with flip down back seats... Just put a new tent on it... I'll take $250

537684,scugpg,2011-01-11 00:26:00,1373,Thanks guys. Anyone else have some ideas on a flip over that can house 2 people and light enough to pull by hand?
537830,cwpowell,2011-01-11 04:17:00,265,"I just purchased the Eskimo Quickflip 2. I love it. Fits my father and me perfect we've pulled it all over simcoe. 2 person flip over fixed in sled. Check it out. It's a few hundred bucks cheaper than the Clam and really no difference. Sets up quick, and folds down quick."
537832,ch312,2011-01-11 04:26:00,1590, clam yukon tc.  probably 150lbs+ with gear. on bare ice you can pull it with one finger and its no problem walking a couple km's in the snow. if it gets too heavy just share the load with buddies by attaching ropes for each person to pull.  it takes a lot less effort than you'd think...
538007,SylvanOwner,2011-01-11 17:35:00,266,"Can't help you out on what ELSE there is out there but I wanted to say that I have a Shappell 1.5 Rover DX, you mentioned it in the original post, and while I mostly use it for just myself I find it excellent.  It'd be tough fishing 2 people out of it but to use a base station or taking turns inside would be a good choice.  Bought it a BassPro a few years back for $225.  PM or post if you have any questions about it.   Dan"
538016,jedimaster,2011-01-11 17:55:00,3472,"I had a 2 man clam flip over and I sold it very quickly as it was too heavy to pull by hand. I now have a clam pop up and its awesome. I can stand up in it, fit 4-6 people in it and its a 1/4 of the weight of the flip."
539018,scugpg,2011-01-13 22:08:00,1373,Anyone else find the 2 man flips to heavy to pull by hand?
539020,irishfield,2011-01-13 22:16:00,26272,Depends how far you're pulling .. we pull our 2 mans out during early ice. I have all my crap loaded in.. including a 20 lb propane tank and I don't find it too bad in up to 3 inches of snow. I wouldn't want to go a mile or anything though..... and Terry lies down about 4 times getting there!! LOL
539033,SBCregal,2011-01-13 22:44:00,688,"i got jenn to sit in an eskimo quickflip2 at lebarons when we were there for the boxing day sale.  after sitting in that wind on simcoe last weekend, she has since decided we're getting one.  just keeping our eye out for the best pricing.  ryan"
539034,Terry,2011-01-13 22:46:00,14456, it wasn't 4 times
539035,irishfield,2011-01-13 22:47:00,26272,Did I miss one before I got down the hill to the ice!!! LMAO !!
539040,BillM,2011-01-13 22:59:00,17367,Just bought a Clam Nanook Thermal..  Absolutely love it.
539316,scugpg,2011-01-14 15:47:00,1373,"Since I don't fish anywhere that I can tow the shelter, sounds like the 2 man is really tough to pull in any amount of snow"
539390,cityfisher,2011-01-14 18:38:00,959,"fully rigged up with auger, rods, tackle, food, heater, propane my clam 2 man pro is quite heavy...with 2 guys pulling its still a pain ... short distances its manageable"
539578,scugpg,2011-01-15 01:52:00,1373, Good to know thank you. Around here its not a straight shot into ponds etc so the 2 man prolly isn't the best option.
