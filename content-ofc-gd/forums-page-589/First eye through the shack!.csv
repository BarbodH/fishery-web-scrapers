538891,LucG,2011-01-13 17:47:00,779,"Pulled in my first walleye in the shack last night, and it could not have been a better one to ask for. Allthough I was really hoping for a few nice sized eating fish, i was not disapointed. Measured 24"", but I put her back anyways. We're fishing in about 35FOW and caught this one on a huge shinner at about 4:45.  "
538892,Dutchy,2011-01-13 17:48:00,416,Nice looking eye. Great job
538911,Spiel,2011-01-13 18:28:00,9065,Solid fish Luc.  But if it came from 35FOW why I'm I trying to figure out 61cm.....
538912,corvette1,2011-01-13 18:30:00,1765,nice eye congrats
538915,mercman,2011-01-13 18:41:00,7054,Nice wally !!!!!!!!!!! its what......about 24'' ?
538921,LucG,2011-01-13 18:46:00,779,"   ok, 24""...lol"
538924,Spiel,2011-01-13 18:50:00,9065,"  Thanks Luc.  It's your parade and I shouldn't rain on it (I'm only teasing) but I still can't think in metric, old age ya know.  Nice fish."
538964,kickingfrog,2011-01-13 20:15:00,8333," Glad to see you're back to your old self Spiel.    Nice 'eye LucG. I put the ones out that end of the slot back as well (on Nipissing), drives my cousin and one friend nuts."
538989,LucG,2011-01-13 20:52:00,779," It drives a few of my friends nuts as well...but I couldnt care less...  Besides, the smaller ones are better tasting for a reason. This one had a very large abnormal growth on its side."

538995,Nipfisher,2011-01-13 21:05:00,2449," Speil, The slot size is easier to type at 40cm -60 cm rather than 15 and 3/4 - 23 and 5/8."
538996,LucG,2011-01-13 21:07:00,779, I knew there was some reason behind my madness...
