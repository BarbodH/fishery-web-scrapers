It is a bit cheaper at the boat show:  http://radioworld.ca...roducts_id=5618  And before the DI stuff starts. The DI on the newer798c SI HD is the same as the older 798c SI. The new 2011 model does have better networking built in including sonar, GPS and waypoint info sharing at $1050.   Can someone tell me how much they are selling the 2010 Hotmaps premium for at the boat show?"
