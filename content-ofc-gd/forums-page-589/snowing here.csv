539682,bassdreamer,2011-01-15 12:14:00,128,Coming down pretty good here in Ajax !! A day to do the honey-do list !lol.
539714,irishfield,2011-01-15 14:54:00,26272,Glad I don't live in Bradford where you need 7 cameras in your yard!!
539716,Grimace,2011-01-15 15:00:00,2020,Holy cow Terry.  The government won't be sneaking up on you.
539720,Woodsman,2011-01-15 15:08:00,1286,"I'd rather have your weather than what we're getting here. -4 C, freezing drizzle, wind SW 33 km/h Not great for heading out on the ice."
539721,irishfield,2011-01-15 15:25:00,26272,  Just one of the rare opportunities Terry got to view the honey do monitor. His wife usually sits there and watches while he performs the list outside the house.
539722,Joey,2011-01-15 15:31:00,9122,Snowing like the dickins here too.  That drive to Stoney Creek is looking grim  How do you think the ice will hold up for for tomorrow Terry?
539725,fishing n autograph,2011-01-15 15:36:00,2540,snowin pretty good here too
539753,Sinker,2011-01-15 16:45:00,8692,I blew the walkways this morning at 9am. Right now they have at least 15cm on them again. I blew at least that much off them this morning. Its coming down hard here and isn't supposed to stop!!!  S.
539756,Terry,2011-01-15 16:59:00,14456,yup   just blew the driveway  I don't think the snow will hurt the ice at all it won't help  but will not hurt it  there should be more reports tonight and a friend is call me tonight to let me know how he found it today   so I am ready to go
539758,Terry,2011-01-15 17:02:00,14456,"cameras what cameras   I got them after I had my ATV stolen and I sleep better at night  I caught two guys walk up my driveway and started pointing at my boat then one of them saw the IR lights, I could even make out what word one of them said before they ran away..........I am pretty sure it saved something from being stolen.....  cops think I have a grow op"
539759,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-15 17:06:00,390,"  Two days before Christmas someone walked all the way up my driveway, rifled through my truck, took some things.  Then walked over to the barn and looked inside.  Walked over to one of my other outbuildings and the motion sensor light came on and spooked him.  Pretty ballsy since my son and I were home and my laneway is around 800 feet back from the road.  Never locked anything up until now."
539787,Leecher,2011-01-15 18:17:00,7832,"Been coming down steadily up here too..... they're saying, it should stop around 10:00pm tonight.  Got some salties ready to go for tomorrow"
539843,Beans,2011-01-15 22:07:00,3339,It just started snowing again (05:00pm) up this way...   Stopped around 02:00pm and Maribeth and I cleared the driveway...  It just started snowing again (05:00pm) up this way...GRRRRRRR
539846,lew,2011-01-15 22:13:00,12766,"Exactly the same day we had over here Norm, Patches of clear sky and sunshine at 2, got everything cleaned up and now it's snowing quite hard again.  Sure is purty though"
539869,Fisherman,2011-01-16 00:32:00,7201," I went out this morning off Gilford, about 8-10 inches of powder snow, stayed 3 hours and there was a ""few"" more inches of snow that had fallen, no problem getting around on the ATV. Only thing I noticed was the water slowly coming out of the holes, maybe the snow is weighing it down a bit.  The ice at the end of Gilford Rd has a little bump, no problem,  but, the lemmings showed up today.  Why the hell does everyone have to park like they're at W-mart?  Put 20-30 feet between vehicles to spread out the weight.  Caught a few dinks, checked out the new X67, very east to use and man is it fast. It shows a BB sized splitshot exactly 12 inches above the hook/minnow.  Heard from someone else they had caught a nice bunch of good sized perch ""out on the lake"""
539873,irishfield,2011-01-16 00:34:00,26272,"I plowed 12"" or so at 2 to 3 pm... now another 5 inches on the back step.. Gonna get messy out there.. some of it on questionable ice. Be careful folks..."
