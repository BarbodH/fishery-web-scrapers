539705,Woodsman,2011-01-15 14:22:00,1286,Not a good idea to use bait from a VHS positive area in a non VHS area. That being said there is nothing illegal about bring the bait there for personal use. The transport restrictions are on bait for commercial sale.  Rick
539712,Pikeslayer,2011-01-15 14:49:00,1443," Yes, you can bring live bait but you can't release it live in the water you are fishing. You need to dispose of any remaining live bait on shore. per MNR: No Release of Bait It is illegal to release any live bait or dump the contents of a bait bucket, including the water, into any waters or within 30 m of any waters. Also here is a link regarding VHS that Woodsman referred to; http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Newsroom/LatestNews/MNR_E004139.html  Regards, Pikeslayer"
