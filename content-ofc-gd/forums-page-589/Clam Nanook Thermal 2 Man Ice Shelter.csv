539407,Joey,2011-01-14 19:30:00,9122,"Now that we sold our Clam 2000, we've been trying to get a Nanook Thermal 2 Man.  Not an easy task.  Has anyone seen them in and around the GTA?  Would even be willing to drive an hour.  Anyone in Barrie?  If anyone sees or has seen them can you let me know please.  Thanks  Joey"
539414,Terry,2011-01-14 19:34:00,14456,OK that's it   I was as jealous as hell when you showed up with a nice new trailer  then that beautiful ski-doo popped out the back of the trailer and I started to drool  I don't think I could take it seeing a nice new thermal Nanook too...............  sunday EH.......
539416,Joey,2011-01-14 19:36:00,9122,"Hahaha, sorry Terry  Yup, Sunday's looking good"
539424,misfish,2011-01-14 19:45:00,29133,Sry J .No luck.
539432,shan&jay,2011-01-14 19:53:00,55,Think bass pro had them the other day
539498,Joey,2011-01-14 23:02:00,9122," They probably just had the Nanook, not the Thermal Nanook. I called and they said no thermal, but thanks anyhow.  And thanks for the PM's from everyone, really appreciate the help looking.  Unfortunately, the hunt is still on.  What kills me is the USA has tons, but the shipping is ridiculous.  You'd think Canada would need Thermal more than USA"
539509,miller,2011-01-14 23:11:00,223,"try giving fishing world in stoney creek a call, i know i saw a nanook in there but i'm not sure if it was thermal or not.  Fishing World 2411 Barton Street East Hamilton, ON L8E 2W9 (905) 573-2288"
539511,irishfield,2011-01-14 23:13:00,26272,I was pretty certain it was a thermal Nanook I saw in there (BPS) when sitting in them all before Christmas.. PM 2jack2 Joey..
539513,cwpowell,2011-01-14 23:22:00,265,Yep Fishing World has em'. Good luck thats a nice tent.
539519,Joey,2011-01-14 23:45:00,9122,"Nope called BPS - none, but Fishing World has them so I guess we're going for a drive tomorrow.  Thanks cwpowell and everyone else who looked into this for me!!  Joey"
539522,irishfield,2011-01-14 23:47:00,26272, Yah.. they said the same thing on the phone to Walleyejack about Frabill Trekkers... Jackie Chan 2jack2 seems to be the only one there that really knows what's going on...
539617,Joey,2011-01-15 03:01:00,9122," Okay, 2Jack2 says no, they don't have them."
539619,irishfield,2011-01-15 03:05:00,26272,Well then they defintely don't !! lol  so now with all that posting.. Fishing World just raised their prices before going home for the night...
539723,fishinfool,2011-01-15 15:32:00,366,"I just purchased my Clam Nanook Thermal at Gagnon's sports 1 week after Christmas. Paid $450, they had a deal on so I did not have to pay the taxes. So with the money I saved, I bought the cover for it, that was $56, again no tax. Try giving them a call to see if they have any left. I had a discussion on here not long ago about the bolts that Clam sends with that unit and the general consensus is that they are crap. Clam will send you new bolts if you can wait, I just went to Brafasco and spent $30 and bought Stainless Steel bolts and Nylock nuts instead. You will love this tent, it is awesome and well worth the $$. Hope you find what you are looking for.  Stan"
539724,Joey,2011-01-15 15:34:00,9122,"Yep, I did my homework and saw your post previously fishnfool.  Gagnon's is out of them now, but I did remember what you said about the bolts.  Will be picking up some.  Thanks  Joey"
539726,cityfisher,2011-01-15 15:43:00,959,"I've seen them in action , really nice just like my clam pro seats better"
539778,BillM,2011-01-15 18:01:00,17367,"Bought mine at Tromblys in Orillia, onsale for $399, no tax.  A we bit far from the GTA though."
539859,vinnimon,2011-01-15 23:36:00,2593,"They had two on display, one was a thermal hut, the other wasnt.  That was a few weeks ago mind you.  Give them a shout joey, you may be able to talk them down a bit in price  I never paid sticker price on any big purchases at all, they may even match any catalogues prices and beat it.  BPS wont, I know! But thats a rant for another day!"
539876,sirfish,2011-01-16 00:54:00,175,Clam only produces so many a season.They are sent to dealers per thier orders. When they are gone they are gone.You would think they would keep producing a little longer. Joey deal with Blake @ fishing world if they have one he'll fix you up.
539885,Joey,2011-01-16 01:21:00,9122,"Okay, thanks for all the help!  Found one at Fishing World.  Thanks alot all"
