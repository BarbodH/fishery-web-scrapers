539595,pigeonfisher,2011-01-15 02:12:00,696,"Ladies and Gents,  How go thee?  Things here in Southern PA are generally well.  Work has been busy, biggest boy is 6 1/2 (Coop), Middle Boy is 3 1/2 (Carson) and Baby Boy is almost 2 (Callum).  We keep really busy as a family with various types of events.  Fishing has been replaced by running with the wife and I both training for upcoming races.  Mine a marathon in Gettysburg, PA and hers a 1/2 Marathon somewhere close by as well.  The big one loves reading and writing (must get it from Mom) and the Middle one loves gymnastics & swimming.  The smallest one loves his brothers, whatever they are doing.  I think of you all (mostly fondly) often and hope that life keeps you all well."
