""  #2 The second, a Quebec surgeon, responds: "" Yeah, but you should try electricians. Everything inside of them is colour coded. ""  #3 The third, a B.C. surgeon, says: "" No, I really think librarians are the best, everything inside of them is in alphabetical order. ""  #4 The fourth, an Alberta surgeon, chimes in: "" You know, I like construction workers.... those guys always understand when you have a few parts left over. ""  #5 But, the fifth, a Newfoundland surgeon, shut them all up when he observed: "" You're all wrong. Politicians are the easiest to operate on. There's no guts, no heart, no balls, no brains, and no spine, -- and the head and the ass are interchangeable. ""      Tracker (Don)"
