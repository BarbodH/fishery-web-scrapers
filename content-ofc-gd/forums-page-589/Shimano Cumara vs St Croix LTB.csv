539325,MSBruno,2011-01-14 15:57:00,369,"Looking to add more rod(s) to my setup this year.  I currently own cumara's, 72MHXF, and really like fishing with it.  I started looking at the St Croix LTB series of rods (same price point) and decided to go to my local shop and pick up comparable rods.  I prefer a stiffer rod, hence the XF tips.  I had both cumara and LTB 6'8"", M, XF spinning rods.  One in each hand, then swapped them, so I don't become right hand biased.  I felt the cumara was lighter and more sentitive, while the LTB was more of a XF whereas the Cumara had a slower taper (bother being thier XF tapers).  This is all just me being very subjective and maybe Cumara-biased (since I own Cumaras) and this leads me to my question to OFC.  Anyone ever have the chance to fish both rods?  Thoughts?  Thanks for your time."
539361,Dan668,2011-01-14 17:28:00,1120,"If it were between those two, I like the cumura better than the ltb series. I prefer the eva to the cork also. The st croix tips are faster though in the models I've tried. I've only tried the casting models though. I'm currently building a custom micro on a st croix scv, the blank above the ltb, can't wait to see how it turnsout."
539362,Dan668,2011-01-14 17:31:00,1120,"Forgot to mention the cumuras were a tad lighter, and were more sensitive than the ltb series. Either way both are good rods, can't go wrong with either"
539363,PikeMolester,2011-01-14 17:36:00,428,The fact that I can just bring a broken shimano to a shop here in montreal and they give me a new rod instantly will keep me from ever buying a St-Croix from a store.
539387,bare foot wader,2011-01-14 18:33:00,1354,  interesting...I have done that with 2 st. croix i've broken...walked in and walked out...maybe it depends on the specific store???
539392,MSBruno,2011-01-14 19:00:00,369,I'm no so concerned with warranties.  Both companies stand by their rods.
539396,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-14 19:14:00,3761,I'm a fan of the St Croix's. Planning on 2 more LTB rods for next season...maybe 3
539431,MSBruno,2011-01-14 19:52:00,369, Any fishing experience with the Cumara line?
539489,scugpg,2011-01-14 22:36:00,1373,Id go ltb without hesitation
539878,sirfish,2011-01-16 01:09:00,175,Hands down the Cumara. Incredible tip sensitivity. Awesome rod for the Lower Niagara winter steel.
