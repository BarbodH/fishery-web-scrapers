539512,codered,2011-01-14 23:18:00,123,I just got back from lady simcoe .I started fishing in 25fow for perch butt was slow and only small one so I  moved out to 62fow to try for some whitefish. well no whities butt right away  got into some decent sized perch  I think the first 4 fish were over 10 the biggest was 13. I went home with a nice bag for  a snack I did notice that the air bladder of the deep fish were popping out on some  of them . this is from bringing them up to fast  from  the deep water as I understand. what do most people do with the small ones that there bladder pops out that are usauly to small for the table??? i am looking for some information on this any help would be apreaciated..
539517,Cudz,2011-01-14 23:40:00,2652,They need to be fizzed.  pierce a tiny hole in the air bladder before you release them or they won't be able to swim back down. I usually try to reel perch up slowly.  They don't havethe ability like a laker to expel the gasses.
539525,Terry,2011-01-14 23:50:00,14456,a slow retrieve helps as does that fizzing trick but best to not fish deep for them unless you are real hungry
539528,canadadude,2011-01-14 23:54:00,769,"this crap goes on Erie all the time, you may try to fizz them if there blowing the blader out the mouth there history keep&clean, part of fish'n deep water perch. Slow retrieve is the only help but it dosn't always work, but thats whats best"
539581,codered,2011-01-15 01:57:00,123,thx  for the info. I usauly dont fish perch. I'm  usauly on the deep water species. Butt thanks for the info I wonder how many people know these facts? thanks again
539645,perchslayer666,2011-01-15 04:17:00,280,"Uh....the ""air bladder"" you see coming out of their mouth is not the air bladder - its their stomach. Bring them up slowly and they'll go down the hole."
539673,bottombouncer,2011-01-15 10:57:00,21,"anything under 30 ft is usually good,fizzing works if you know how to do it properly.you can always practise on a fish that you intend on keeping..."
539974,Garnet,2011-01-16 11:17:00,2056,What you see is there stomach.  If you immediately release I've never had a problem with floaters. In the boat I've watch perch swim down 20ft never to be seen again.  One time I caught the same fish about 20 minutes later in 56 ft. of water and it swam right back down for the second time. And that makes me reject the theory of survival.
539977,Rich,2011-01-16 11:31:00,3927,"Regularly been getting perch on the reservoir in 26 feet, I horse them up usually, lol.. no problems yet. Though I haven't got any small enough to put back either. What a great year for panfish."
