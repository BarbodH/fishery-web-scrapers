539567,Fisherman,2011-01-15 01:21:00,7201,"Google VW Amarok, already being built, very unlikely we'll ever see it in North America cause it would put the smaller pick ups at the back of the line, comes with a variety of 4x4 and diesel power.  Forgot, the old Rabbit pick up also came with a 1.6 diesel.  That other abortion made in the US along with the other variants didn't last long, they closed the plant and had them built elsewhere."
539591,John Bacon,2011-01-15 02:06:00,3277," ""funny functional"" ???"
539680,outllaw,2011-01-15 11:54:00,1232,every maker has faults. i will keep my jeep liberty.it starts and it does stop when i apply the brakes.
538801,Billy Bob,2011-01-13 14:35:00,5865,http://www.internetautoguide.com/10-12-2011-16-297/2011-chevrolet-avalanche-recalls.html  And NOTHING about this that I heard by our media....
538862,Fisherman,2011-01-13 16:28:00,7201,"Hmm, we had that on the news here about 3 weeks ago already, quality control or lack thereof...again."
538928,tb4me,2011-01-13 18:55:00,3295,"wouldnt drive a GM anyway so im all good here...My dad bought one new in 2008 and it was the biggest piece of crap he EVER bought, all rusted out already..Had to do a complete break job at 50 thou. Tailgaite wouldnt close a month after warrenty. ECT ECT.Its a shame thou as it set him back 46 thou..Sad really."
538929,irishfield,2011-01-13 18:57:00,26272,Boys at Ford liked the news when I gave it to them at noon !
538950,Billy Bob,2011-01-13 19:53:00,5865,"If it was GM's biggest rival, Toyota, the Obama media would have been on it like stink on a monkey."
538957,craigdritchie,2011-01-13 20:05:00,1586,"It did get press coverage up here, but to Fisherman's point, that was a couple of weeks ago."
538961,lew,2011-01-13 20:14:00,12766,I also heard recentely about a recall on the Ford F-150's but so far I haven't been contacted by my dealer. If I don't hear by next week I'll give them a call.  Something evidentely can short out causing a fire but details were sketchy at best.
538969,blaque,2011-01-13 20:24:00,2419, This is what i believe your referring to Lew. I heard about it but also have not been contacted by the dealer on the issue.  I got a Christmas Card from them though  Ford Recall
538986,lew,2011-01-13 20:49:00,12766,"Thanks Blaque, that sounds like the one I was referring to. Appears the problem was caused in October so fortunately, I'm not affected."
538988,Billy Bob,2011-01-13 20:51:00,5865," Huh, I must of missed it then...."
539023,Rod Caster,2011-01-13 22:21:00,5784,"I'd write up a good reply, but my Toyota Corolla is doing 120 and speeding up on it's own...I hope this highway doesn't end."
539026,craigdritchie,2011-01-13 22:30:00,1586,"Right in the middle of the Christmas holidays ... I bet a LOT of people missed it. Lucky timing for GM I guess, not so much for anyone who owns one of the trucks and doesn't know."

539102,spincast,2011-01-14 01:11:00,3279,"If you really look deeply you will see that the same companies make the parts for all the majors......... so eventually, they will all experience similar problems the toyotas and hondas (model dependent) buy from the same companies as the fords and gms (canada / US made models). Me - proud owner of: GM - failed head and intake manifold gaskets, bubbled paint, but great riding vehicle and economy; bone head hit and rolled me at leats 80K before it shoud have been retired FORD, failed ball joints and starter motor, but great pick up (ranger - BEFORE Mazda - 2 kids and a dog required an upgrade to the GM ) Toyota - funny little thing abouth the spare tire - but comes equipped standard to pull my boat and does a great job (no required tranny cooler etc) - but too low Hyundai - 0 interference engine - it breaks, it breaks big - but besides that 0  Chrysler - welll....... the taxi I drove in 81 (fury III) was fast and hot, but since then..... not so much , but thats me - I know a lot of Ram fans....."
539105,BillM,2011-01-14 01:13:00,17367,"There is no perfect truck out there, regardless of what anyone thinks.  They all have their problems.."
539107,walleyejigger,2011-01-14 01:18:00,876,"IMO, the best truck is the one you get the best deal on at the time equipped as you need it,  other than that it's a crap shoot,  i've only owned ford as it was always the better ""deal"" at the time i was looking, never had any problems either....knock on wood.... but the last one i got '06 supercrew started to rust prematurely, i've got a nasty area around my gas cap/cover,"
539180,Mattones,2011-01-14 03:29:00,587,"Yeah its prob their spark plug issue. LOL  Each company has their issues.  But Ill stick to my RAM, No problems with her. Rides smoothly and getting nearly 700/kms a tank. Im happy.   But it will all change when I get the 6' lift this summer! haha  Only truck in ON with that hood as of 09/10"
539204,Cudz,2011-01-14 04:45:00,2652,Nice looking ride.  Is that hood scoop functional. I would assume no unless the air intake is somehow hooked up to it.
539252,Fish4Eyes,2011-01-14 13:27:00,1022," Correction, there would be if VW made one  . They thought about it, but didn't think there would be a market for them."
539260,Rod Caster,2011-01-14 13:42:00,5784,"  Or it would end up on the Lemon list along with the Toureg.    exactly why I have a Mazda B4000....by far not the best engineered truck out there, but it's cheap and does it's job well."
539273,craigdritchie,2011-01-14 14:11:00,1586,"Actually, VW did make a small pickup for many years, starting in the mid-70s and continuing into the late 80s or perhaps early 90s. It was based on their Rabbit/Golf platform, and called the Sporttruck. They didn't sell very well here in Canada, but did very well in Europe, South America and in Australia, where fuel prices have always been higher. You still see the odd one around here at classic car shows every summer, especially events with a lot of VWs.    Presently, VW is looking at building a new pickup, based on its Touareg SUV platform. Here's a picture of the concept truck they showed at the Frankfurt Auto Show last year. No word on when it will be built, what it will cost or if/when it might come to Canada. But if it's anything at all like the Touareg, its 4x4 will go through just about anything and pull a 6,500 pound boat.  "
539329,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 16:03:00,5865," Yep, no one wants a perfect truck...."
539348,Fish4Eyes,2011-01-14 16:55:00,1022,
539354,craigdritchie,2011-01-14 17:09:00,1586,Kind of like an econobox version of an El Camino.
539544,Mattones,2011-01-15 00:29:00,587,Yep its funny functional. Not like the Challenger hoods that Dodge Makes. After market is the way to go. Iv been flagged down by other guys with the same truck asking about the hood.  Cheaped out on the under the hood paint just ognna buy the spray paint and goto town in the summer.
