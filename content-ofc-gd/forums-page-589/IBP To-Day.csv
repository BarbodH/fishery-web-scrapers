539497,RickOnt,2011-01-14 22:52:00,669,"Headed out this AM Hoping to get into a Whitie!!!   Some ""Real"" Fishing LOL  A change from Perch  Well  I found where the Jumbos are hiding   83' off IBP..  Started marking a LOT of Fish But could not Hook Up Finally pulled up My Biggest Perch of the Year a 14"" er  I downsized a bit with the bait and All I got was Perch and here I thought I was marking the Motherload of Whities!!!   So No Whities or Lakers for ME.  But LOTS more PERCH  Saw one Laker iced no Whities.  Fished 5 different spots from 74 FOW to 86 FOW all holes drilled today About 6"" of Ice(I was expecting a bit more, and I talked to a Guy on foot who said he cut a spot of only 4.5"" ) and 3"" of snow Good running with the Bike.  Not a LOT of Ice what with the crowd that will be there this weekend So BE CAREFUL and Play Safe   Rick"
539499,Terry,2011-01-14 23:02:00,14456,thanks for the report I will be heading out on the weekend lets hope we all figure out where the whitefish are

539524,Cudz,2011-01-14 23:49:00,2652,Do perch seem to be deeper this year?  I can't recall pulling this number of perch up from 70+ feet in the past.  Seem to be 10 more females than males.  Maybe I keep throwing the males back.
539526,Terry,2011-01-14 23:51:00,14456,we have been finding a lot of them deep but many years that's where I find them
