539746,Big Cliff,2011-01-15 16:34:00,6899,"Just got back in the house, visibility about 700' max. Since I wouldn't be able to see shore from where I wanted to try today I decided it might be better to just sit tight.  I'd hate to get into any kind of trouble out there especially when I have a friend along and be in a situation where I couldn't get help.  So I called my buddy and cancelled, we'll get out another day! Good kid, he's cool with it but still wanted to know if he should come over and clean my drive way for me anyway.  Safety first, there will be lots more days to get out fishing!"
539750,skeeter,2011-01-15 16:38:00,1907,good call cliff. are you going to video the kid shoveling your drive way?
539757,aplumma,2011-01-15 16:59:00,6896,what no bread crumbs??? probably best to sit it out till the snow stops.   Art
539761,Big Cliff,2011-01-15 17:15:00,6899," Naw, I have a kick ass snow blower sitting here that a customer hasn't come back to pick up yet, I had to test it out just to make sure everything worked properly LOL. Besides I wouldn't ask him to drive out here just to clean my driveway especially when I don't think it's safe to go out fishing in this stuff. I like this young man, I want to keep him around for a while!"
539772,irishfield,2011-01-15 17:47:00,26272,The things old men do to get young lads to shovel their laneway....
539776,aplumma,2011-01-15 17:57:00,6896,So who is the lucky candidate who gets a rain snow check ?   Art
539779,Woodsman,2011-01-15 18:01:00,1286,"Cliff I always carry a compass.  I'm sure you still remember how to use one as I know you had good training. Usually a GPS also, but a compasses batteries don't fail. BTW; What starts out as a good day can be changed very quickly to zero visibility.  Be safe: Rick"
539785,aplumma,2011-01-15 18:14:00,6896,I had a friend of mine who carried a compass on a key chain with lots of keys and he couldn't figure out why it read differently than the one in my truck. I told him it was because the truck was digital and his compass was analog.  The good news is we don't let him go out in the woods unescorted any more....  Art
539788,Leecher,2011-01-15 18:26:00,7832,"Good call Cliff     I too did not venture out cause of the snow coming down and visibility.  I did however made a drive to a close local lake and there was no one fishing.  Like you said, ""Safety first, there will be lots more days to get out fishing!"" Tight lines Leechman"
539791,Big Cliff,2011-01-15 18:35:00,6899," About 15 years ago my son, daughter-in-law and grandaughter gave me a compas for Christmas one year. Inscribed on it was ""love from your son and his girls, just so you can always find your way home to us"". I carry it with me everytime I go into the outdoors. (I also carry my GPS these days) but when it gets bad enough I can't see more than 3 or 4 hundred yards ahead I tend to err on the side of cauton especially when I have a young charge in tow. I couldn't live with myself if my stupidity caused someone else their life."
