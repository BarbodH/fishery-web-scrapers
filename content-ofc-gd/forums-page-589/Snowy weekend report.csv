540285,12footspringbok,2011-01-17 01:44:00,459,Wanted to get the machine out on the ice this weekend so i decided to stay a lil further south where the ice ice a bit thicker.  Toured out first thing off lefroy through the snow north and poked a few holes and settled over a school of frisky perch. Lots of action all day a few jumbo's and enough for a good fry.            Woke up this morning to 8 inches of fresh snow debated it but ending up getting out the shovel and going. Reconized and OFNER in the tim hortons on innisfil beach road Fishhunter(Loyd) said hello guess he was meeting up with terry and the fellas of IBP.  Decided to hit the same area again today this time just a little deeper hoping to get maybe a cruising whitie mixed in with the perch. Instead we just got cruising herring  with the perch. Called her an early day.         Looking forward to nippissing next weekend.  And the main lake in february lots of snow out on the ice and a few small slush patches forming hopfully we get some really cold weather.
