My friend on the other hand wasn't so lucky, got skunked and the weight that allowed to the camera to sink snapped off so now we where cameraless but that didn't stop me from finding fish muahahahaha.  caught this beast of a fish on my UL with 2 pound line, kept him since I figured what the hey been craving since the smaller one I got before new years there.
