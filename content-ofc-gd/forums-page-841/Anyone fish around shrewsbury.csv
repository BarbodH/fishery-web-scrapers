You can pm me if you like and no i am not looking for specific spots, only if this area of erie is worth trying.  Thanks  Berge"
346415,Victor,2009-05-30 21:49:00,1609,Carp should be everywhere ... I have never fish that area before but if theres monsters at dunnville I don't see why they wouldn't be at the region near chatham.  When's he coming home? lets go out for some big carp.

346505,Sandbag,2009-05-31 12:15:00,533,"There are plenty of carp and panfish as well as Bass in the Shrewsbury/Rondeau Bay area.  The pier in Erieau can be good for Perch and Sheepshead.  The Thames river that runs right through Chatham is usually good for carp, cats, silver bass, etc etc.  I grew up fishing on the Thames river in Chatham and there was always something biting.  If your son has wheels to get around, Mitchell's Bay on Lake St. Clair is only 15-20 minutes away as well.  Cheers  Craig"
