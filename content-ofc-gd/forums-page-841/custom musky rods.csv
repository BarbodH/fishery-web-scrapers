345620,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 01:56:00,89,"found this guy, RKcustom rods.net off kijiji when i was searching for musky rods..  i'll be picking up a 6'6'' compre this weekend, which i thinik will be suitable for trolling, jerkbaiting, and throwing my large cranks   i'm thinking of getting a 7'6'' or so rod made for throw bucktails etc. to put with my c4 reel  is this a good idea, what i mean is..is a rod this length suitable for my application?  i'm thinking medium heavy with a fast tip so i can realy whip those bucks out there  he offers, "" tiger eye"" "" batson"" and "" st croix"" rods and the prices are very reasonable i thought. i could get my name in the rod and everything haha   any opinions??"

345629,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 09:34:00,89,thanks gerry
345635,solopaddler,2009-05-28 10:52:00,8605,"If you're asking about rod length for that application, then yeah that's a good length. Personally I'd go even a bit longer with an 8'er."
345636,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 10:56:00,89,"the 8 footer with allow better fish control, hook set and furthur casts  if  i am not mistaken. right?"
345668,Raf,2009-05-28 12:20:00,3495,correct.. 8' would be my top choice for a small bucktail/topwater rod.  it's also a good length/action for a trolling rod.  read this
345678,Garry2Rs,2009-05-28 12:44:00,1425,"Longer rods will cast a little farther...but...they aren't as accurate.  If an extra foot of length equals an extra three feet of distance it also can mean you are an extra three feet farther from the target.  To look at it a different way, say that with a six foot rod you can reach a target but you're average cast will miss the bull's eye by about a foot.  A seven foot rod will multiply your  error by three. Sometimes they are easier to figure-eight with. The latest fashion trend is toward longer rods.  Twenty years ago a six-six was a long rod. Longer rods are more dangerous to others in a boat.  Two or three feet of leader, 8 to10 inches of bait, eight feet of rod and three feet of arm means everyone in a twenty foot boat needs to be aware of the guy swinging the weapon. I had a client, using a 7' 3"" rod, take a rod out of my hand last year. He was on the rear deck, while I was stand at the trolling motor of a boat over 18 feet long! In a careless moment he tried to send a long cast to a distant target directly behind the boat. His Sledge crossed in front of my face, and the hooks snagged my rod, and breaking it in two. That was his last trip with me!"
345718,Crazyhook,2009-05-28 13:57:00,1154,"Gerry, I would say that all depends who is casting. Longer rods do take some practive but once you get used to them its easy to be accurate IMO"
345722,mattyk,2009-05-28 14:07:00,2110,longer rods are much better for figure 8's
345830,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 18:53:00,89,"thanks guys, i ordered 2 custom rods, both 8 foot med heavy fast tip  1 for me and 1 for my dad for fathers day  both st croix"
345835,Raf,2009-05-28 19:04:00,3495,"Garry that's scary stuff about your client nearly hooking you.  I think a little common sense goes a long way.. there are times when JP and I are both casting with 8'6"" rods on a shorter (17') boat.  I've never felt concerned and I doubt he has either about something bad happenign.  Just be aware and you won't have any issues IMO.  I started out using rods from 6'9"" to 7'6"" but after trying the longer types, I won't go back."
345837,wolfmachine,2009-05-28 19:06:00,89,"my boat is a 17 foot aluminum, but my fishing partner(dad) and i definetly have a system going. we never get in each others way. and a friendly remidner at the beginning of the trip goes along way too"
345975,Spiel,2009-05-29 01:56:00,9065,Does this mean you're not going to answer the PM I sent you in regards to the PM you sent me.
346023,wolfmachine,2009-05-29 09:35:00,89,hahaha
346025,jace,2009-05-29 10:04:00,472,  cool idea for father's day.   Did you add anything or is it one of the rod builds with preselected components? There are some good prices on the website.  He can't be making very much on each rod.
346031,Spiel,2009-05-29 10:58:00,9065," I always get the last laugh, it's in my contract."
346129,Garry2Rs,2009-05-29 16:29:00,1425,"I throw Bucktails and spinnerbaits with a 1/2 to 2 1/2 ounce 7'2"" StCroix and fish Jerkbaits /Gliders with a stiffer 6'3"" or 7 foot rod. I have 8 foot and 9 foot Steelhead casting rods.  They are great for fishing from a pier or from shore but are too long for boat fishing. I think you will find that 8 ft Musky rods are heavy, and tiring to use. The tip will hit the water every time your bait gets close to the boat and they will make netting awkward. At the end of the day, any gain in casting distance will be of little or no real value. These opinions are based on fishing Kawartha size lakes from 16' to 18.5' boats, and casting 8"" bucktails, one ounce spinnerbaits and 10"" Sledge type baits... BUT, these are just my opinions."
346166,Raf,2009-05-29 18:41:00,3495," my experience has been different although i throw bigger blade baits.  yes, they might be slightly heavier but the effort needed to cast and figure 8 all day is reduced with a longer rod.  they load up nicely and fling out the baits with ease whereas with a shorter rod, you have to muscle the casts.  my back isn't what it used to be either and figure 8s are much easier with a long rod (ie. no bending over)  just my opinion as well."
