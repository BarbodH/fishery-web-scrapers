We were hoping for better weather than last year because man was it cold last year. We arirved at Vances resort about 3pm that afternoon. Weather was better and some fish had moved into the river. The first two days we spent trolling the river with worm harnesses. Fishing was slower than i had hoped but we did get a bunch of fish. The third and final day we went out into the bay and trolled various rapalas with some pretty good sucess. The total was about 50 walleye and 10 pike between the four of us. Many fish we caught, many fish were released, a few were eaten, and many tales were told till 1am wiskey in hand...lol. All together it was an awsome trip! Hope to do it again next year. Heres a few pics from the action.   "
