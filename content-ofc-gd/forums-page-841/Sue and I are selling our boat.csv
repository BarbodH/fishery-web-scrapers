346650,Big Cliff,2009-05-31 21:56:00,6899,"Ok, sue and I have a chance to pick up a used boat package and because it has a full windshield and a few other features that us older people like we have decided to go for it so we are going to sell ours and buy the new one. I'll list it in the classifieds here in the next few days and in the local paper but I have never used any of the on line things. My question is, is this Kijiji (sp) or Ebay any good for listing stuff like this?"
346651,big guy,2009-05-31 22:00:00,414,Kijiji is a great place to list it and it's free.
346652,danbouck,2009-05-31 22:01:00,4380,I have sold a lot on Kijiji. It's nice and it's free.  It has a TON of boats listed
346653,rbaquial,2009-05-31 22:02:00,968,Kijiji and Craigslist are EXCELLENT!  I'm almost ALWAYS posting my stuff on their site.
346663,joonmoon,2009-05-31 22:25:00,528,"I use Kijiji a lot and have sold lots of stuff rather quickly...if you set your price right it will move fast. Good luck Cliff, if Andy came with the boat I would seriously contemplate a deal...lol."
346666,Sandbag,2009-05-31 22:40:00,533,Ditto on Kijiji...have used it quite a bit with good success.  You can also advertise on a wide range of major cities if you choose to.  Great tool  Cheers  Craig
346667,Joey,2009-05-31 22:41:00,9122,"Cliff, we just sold our Tracker on Kijiji.  I had a phone call within 10 minutes of listing it, and it sold within 2 days.  Alot of people look there for new (used) boats that come up all the time.  Good Luck.  Joey"
346672,Rizzo,2009-05-31 22:55:00,4754,I listed my boat here for a couple of weeks without a sniff (guess we all have boats!). Put it on Kijiji and sold it with in a couple of days.
346674,brifishrgy,2009-05-31 23:00:00,559,bought alot of stuff through kijiji .. great place to sell stuff and its free
346678,Roy,2009-05-31 23:07:00,13728,"Cliff and Sue, now that you've made it known that that boat is for sale, drop it in our classifieds. People know you here and know that you look after your things and that that boat is worth what you'll be asking for it. I know it's a good vessel, I've been in it. Good luck to you."
346679,BUSTER,2009-05-31 23:07:00,1336,"KIJIJI rocks , just delete and re-post your boat every couple days or when boat ends up on pg 30!!  try to stay on top 5 pages, it'll sell fast."
346689,ccmtcanada,2009-05-31 23:49:00,7971,"I have bought and sold quite a few things on Kijiji.  Actually, the boat I ended up buying was from Kijiji.  List it  in multiple areas, including Toronto and I'm sure you'll get lots of inquiries for sure!  Wish I had the cash, or I'd seriously think about it...your boat is nice!"
346690,rbaquial,2009-05-31 23:50:00,968,Got a picture of the boat by chance?
346704,SBCregal,2009-06-01 00:32:00,688,"only real problem with kijiji is all the dreamers that want to offer you 10% of what you're asking or have silly expectations.  other than weeding through people like that, its great"
346710,Rizzo,2009-06-01 00:46:00,4754,"I agree with list it in multiple cities. I had lots of calls right away when I listed in Toronto (although some were lowball offers from people who had never seen the boat, or wanted to trade for something ridiculous) but the guy who bought it saw it on the Barrie listing...he was able to come over and buy it before any of the Toronto people drove up."
346793,Big Cliff,2009-06-01 10:45:00,6899,"Thanks for the feedback, I have put it in the clasifieds and will try to figure out the Kijiji thing tonight.  Much appreciated!"
346843,BUSTER,2009-06-01 13:36:00,1336,"TIP -write out the ad on microsoft word and save it, when you want to post it anywhere just pull up the ad from word and copy and paste. this way you can delete the ad and repost without having to re-write it every time it gets to page 20, or if you want to post it in other cities, just cut , paste and post it.  cheers"
