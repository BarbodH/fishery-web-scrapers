The morning started off on a quite windy and cold note. Fortunately, the sun managed to break through the overcast sky, thus offering us perfect fishing conditions. I started off by using the classic bobber and worm set up. Only a few minutes into our trip, and I managed to land 3 bluegill and 1 pumpkinseed. Big deal.   My dad wasn't having much luck, and decided to leave for a bit and walk around while I continued to fish. Shortly, I switched to my panfish rig and hooked into more panfish, but still NO PERCH!!!!  A few hours have gone by, and my worm jar is almost done. Thankfully, someone was so gracious enough to leave behind a few minnows, which I ended up using... obviously. I hooked into a small 3"" perch. Not bad for a few hours of fishing.... wrong. With the sun shining, I could see a whole school of perch swimming around my bait.  I switched up my lure, and cast. After a few nibbles, it hit! Down goes my bobber, and of course, I'm caught off guard.  I reeled in a nice 6 1/2"" perch.  My dad ran over and saw my catch and decided he'd give it another go. Yet another strike, I reel in a decet sized perch.... unfortunately though, my hook got tangled up with my dad's line, and the perch fell back in.   Oh well, you win some, you lose some in the game of fishing. Finally I ended the day with a nice 7"" perch.   My dad may have been unlucky, but I was lucky enough to catch 13 different panfish, and 3 perch..... but who's counting?    Yet another great day of fishing under my belt!  3 of the 13 different panfish I caught    3"" Perch  6 1/2"" Perch   7"" Perch  "
