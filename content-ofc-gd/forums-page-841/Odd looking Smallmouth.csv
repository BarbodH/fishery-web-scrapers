345924,Cudz,2009-05-29 00:00:00,2652,"Yep.  You might laugh but you are not far from the truth. It is a transplanted fish from Prince William Sound. They had to be transported  to Ontario, northern Michigan and Northern NY State, after the oil spill.  These bass are more commonly known as the Valdez Bass. Somehow, the engineers in charge of cleaning up the spill inadvertantly pumped crude oil into a few neaby creeks which fed into a well know scientist's (who was alos a bass enthusiasts) pond.  At the time Prof. David Allen, a professor at the University of Michigan (Institute for Fisheries Research), was trying to see how far north smallmouth bass could breed successfully and he had brought smallmouth from Lake Erie and Lake Michigan to Prince William Sound in Alaska.  Apparently the crude oil eventually settled to bottom of his ponds and it settled on many of the rocks.  Although some of the oil was cleared from the ponds, lots still settled on the bottom.  Professer Allan continued to study his bass and although many died he also found that some were begining to take on similar pigment and colours to the surrounding rocks.  He stated that it only took 2 generations to become almost completely mottled.  At the end of his study in Alaska, Allan was instructed to remove all the non-native fish species from the 3 ponds.  He did so, and actually transported the surviving bass back to Lake Erie and Michigan returning each strand to their original habitat.   Since this time the mottled bass have reproduced and again their offspring no longer have such pronounced black markings but occasionally people still catch them in Lake Erie and Lake Michigan with a black dot or two (I have never seen this live or caught one with it).  Reports have also surfaced that some smallmouth bass with black markings have been caught in other lakes that are near the two great lakes.  These recent findings have spawned a whole new study at the Institute for Fisheries Research regarding the smallmouth bass' migratory and movement patterns."

345937,aniceguy,2009-05-29 00:39:00,1094,"Ralph Manns wrote about it a while back this should answer it for ya    The Bass Blotch Mystery      In 1989, Douglas Carlson of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation reported* that largemouth bass with unusual dark blotches were present in the Hudson River Estuary. The markings were a result of an increased number of pigment cells in the skin and occurred on various body surfaces. Bass collected by biologists using electro-shocking equipment were more likely to have these blotches (23 percent) than those caught by bass anglers (11 percent), that there was no noticeable change in the frequency of these sightings between 1985 and 1988, and that biologists in other states contacted in 1986 had also seen similarly marked bass. At that time, most of the sightings were in eastern coastal areas and a few impoundments in the central and southern states.    In 1994, Kathleen Skinner and other biologists at Russell Sage College* * reported several investigations into these markings. They noted that in 1985, New York biologist John Schachte found about 33 percent of Hudson River bass over 12-inches long had blotches, but that 50 percent of bass over 14 inches had them. Other studies made in that year found parasites were probably not the cause and that the bass did not show any other specific cellular pathology. Previous studies of unusual markings on other fish species related abnormal blotches to environmental contaminants, viruses, heredity, the inflammatory responses of the skin’s immune system, or changes in hormones that regulated skin pigment responses. The team noted that another study ruled out a viral cause. Unmarked bass failed to become blotched when inoculated with sera from affected bass, there were no associated skin lesions, and other fish species were not affected.    Skinner’s team checked to see if the Hudson River pollutant, PCB, was a cause. They found PCBs were high in Hudson River bass, concentrations were different in male and female fish, and blotched bass contained more PCBs than unblotched bass from the same areas. But, they noted the blotches occurred in samples from areas without high PCB concentrations and in bass with the same concentrations as the unmarked control bass. They concluded that PCBs ""may not be the cause of LMB black blotch syndrome.""    Other, as yet unstudied, chemicals might be the cause. Increased pigmentation in animal tissue is a natural defense mechanism against heavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons, acids, and other environmental contaminants.       Clearly, more study is needed to explain what is going on. Before Carson’s report was published, I’d seen a few bass with the dark blotching. Since then, the number of blotched fish has seemed to steadily increase and sightings are now common on most Texas waters I fish. I suspect there is a tie-in with the increase in catch-and-release bass fishing since the early 1980s. Carson’s observation that electrofishing produced more blotched bass than angling could be a result of learned, short-term, lure-avoidance responses by recently handled, and thus blotched, bass. The increased percentage of blotched bass in larger sizes could also be associated with catch-and-release, particularly the forced releases in waters with slot limits.       I moved near a lightly-fished pond 10 years ago. At first, the fish I caught had no blotches. Since then, I’ve caught and released about 700 bass a year in this pond, many more than once. I’ve noticed that about a third now show blotching, often around the mouth. I’ve identified re-caught individuals by their marks. I’ve also caught fish with distinct and identifiable blotches at Lake Fork.    Lakes with slot and special limits like Fork that force the release of many large bass seem to hold more blotched fish. Although contaminants may be associated with the blotches, I suspect that handling during catch and release and the hooking and capture process itself are at least related factors. Marks near mouths are easily attributed to lipping techniques. Those on other parts of the body are less frequent on my pond bass than on bass at Fork, but seem to be located at places where bass may have touched a boat, the ground, or have banged into cover while hooked. The lower tail and anal fins seem to be particularly vulnerable. One slot-fish at Lake Fork appeared to have the imprint of a hand across its back.    The marks seem to eventually disappear, suggesting they may be part of a skin or slime repairing process. I was fish the pond less in December and early January. The fish I catch in late January seldom have blotches, but the number of blotches increases over the remainder of a year. I’ve also noted that they seem to disappear faster from smaller adult bass. The largest fish seem to hold them for at least two years.    We need a scientific investigation into the possibility that these blotches are associated with capture and release. They don’t seem to harm bass in any way, and might even prove useful in the identification of individual fish or analysis of capture and release rates if anglers are a cause.  I have a staggering amount of in depth technical data on blotching and bass but the one above always seemed to make the most sense having caught them  and taking a better look for fin rot slime loss, or other outward signs of illness, there has been pathology on it and it usually comes back negative"
345944,Musky or Specks,2009-05-29 00:50:00,2710,Thanks for that I live for scientific data.
345945,aniceguy,2009-05-29 00:54:00,1094,"there are a few thesis's out there that deal with this pigmentation issue, I can dig  them up on another computer typical boring read once you get past the abstract  dont know if its a good tool for mark recapture and population estimates though as I think these bass are pretty plastic and will change pigmentation sooner or later"
345949,Lungelarry,2009-05-29 01:10:00,294,Catch quite a few of them from the Ottawa River and St. Lawrence River... 
346229,Zubris21,2009-05-29 23:29:00,563,"I have a hard time believing these spots are a result of handling and thus catch and release.  Very well could be, it just seems unlikely to me.  After reading the post about the bass transplanted in Alaska evolving better camouflage after the oil spill, I began to wonder if perhaps the fish we are catching are responding to the Zebra mussel outbreak.  It seems logical to me that a bottom covered in zebra mussels would be much darker in colour, and therefore bass would hide more easily with darker colours.  Just a theory, but the time line doesn't seem too far off."
345658,bronze_back,2009-05-28 11:58:00,17,I was fishing in the Magnetawan on Monday and caught this very odd looking smallmouth. Never seen anything like it before. Has anybody caught one like it or know what causes the spotting?      
345662,bushart,2009-05-28 12:11:00,2628,Man Never seen that in over 40 years of anglin---looks like a bass mated with a sauger  Bushart
345666,solopaddler,2009-05-28 12:18:00,8605,"That is fascinating. I've caught bass with the odd very small black patch but nothing like that. Charles Darwin had a theory on this. He said the survivors in a species adapt to their environment better than the non survivors.  This would include changing color as the local environment dictated for prey ambush, predator avoidance etc. Not sure if that’s the case here but it may be as the bass looks otherwise healthy."
345675,Greencoachdog,2009-05-28 12:37:00,8163,Strange looking indeed!  It looks like a form of melanism to me.

345679,ChrisK,2009-05-28 12:49:00,2772,"Ive caught largemouth bass in Long point bay with those types of markings...I always figured it was a skin virus or something like that.... In any case,nice bass !!!  Cheers"
345695,Governator,2009-05-28 13:07:00,879,"Wooow.. that is something else.  I have no idea, it's either a mix of a bass and something else or diseased.  I've caught perch with small black spots but nothing like that."
345713,danada,2009-05-28 13:50:00,31,maybe related to micheal jackson?
345715,Zubris21,2009-05-28 13:55:00,563,"I have caught some Largemouth Bass with similar markings, but not nearly to that extent.  That is by far the most extensive pattern and intensity of black spots that I have ever seen.  Seems like we have been catching them more recently in the past couple of years, but that could just be that I am fishing more.  Anyways we call it black spot disease, however this is just a term we conjured up and I really have no idea what it actually is.  I wonder if there are any studies being done on it?  Mike the Bass Fisherman - You're about to start your post-secondary education in this kind of field... looks like an interesting study/term project for you if your course does these sorts of things."
345721,Banger68,2009-05-28 14:02:00,157,African Cichlids do that kind of spotting all the time. The fish looks healthy and the skin/scales look fine in the dark areas so probably a genetic hicup.
345723,fishnsled,2009-05-28 14:09:00,3520,I've only see this in largemouth's before.  That was until Nippissing a couple of weekends ago and I got a smallie that was blotched up.  Not as much as yours but quite a bit.  I think it's just a skin pigmentation and nothing to be concerned about but I could be wrong.  Cool looking fishing though.
345727,Fisherpete,2009-05-28 14:16:00,1814,"I have caught many largemouth in recent years with spots like that, but the spots are usually the size of a toonie or so. A few years back, I did catch a largie on Rice that was virtually black, but not blotchy like the one in your pic. I took a picture of it next to a normal colour largie for contrast. If you look at the belly of your bass, up near the front, was there some sort of wound or sore there? Maybe the black spotting is some sort of skin virus like lymphosarcoma that muskies get.  My ""black"" bass pic.  "
345729,bluesky1713,2009-05-28 14:23:00,107,"Not sure what you guys are looking at but that doesn't look like a very healthy fish to me.  Its fins look awful.  Especially the dorsal fin.  But the pectoral fin and tail also look like they are rotting away where the black bacteria/virus has affected it.  Granted the damage may be a result of spawning (although it is still a little early) but it looks to me like it is a result of that black issue.  Look at the dorsal fin in the third photo.  It looks like the fin is rotting away.  A nice fish, to be sure, but it looks like it is host to some sort of bacteria or virus and I would doubt that fish will survive very much longer.  Just my opinion though."
345733,Weekend Warrior,2009-05-28 14:29:00,27,"Looks like an Atlantic to me  But seriously, I guess it's not too surprising to see a fish with unusual pigmentation since you see  other animals with it. Having said that, I've never seen anything that extreme.  Either way, nice fish!"
345737,frozen-fire,2009-05-28 14:35:00,542,"doesn't look like it's rotting away to me...just damage (split fins)  it most likely is a skin mutation that isn't seen too often. the fish (other than the obvious discolouration) seems healthy, has proper mass and is eating fine."
345744,Banger68,2009-05-28 14:46:00,157,"The fish has good proportions, round belly, smooth scales, and clear eyes. It looks to be healthy. The fins don't look rotted to me, just a little beat up."
345748,bronze_back,2009-05-28 15:01:00,17,"Thanks for the replies. The fish was healthy as far as I could tell. It was very aggressive while fighting it, eyes were clear and it was fairly chunky.. The red on its belly in the third pic is just the reflection of a red tackle bag that was sitting in front of me."

345765,muskeybugged,2009-05-28 15:31:00,282,What kind of bait did you use? Did he chase it down or did you drop it in front of his nose?
345768,bronze_back,2009-05-28 15:44:00,17," Caught it on a 1/2 oz. Rat-L-Trap. I'm pretty sure he chased it down, but can't be sure because it hit the lure about 40 feet from the boat."

345854,GoneFishin,2009-05-28 20:04:00,349, I agree. Looks fairly healthy and those markings are very dark.
345866,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-28 21:10:00,3761,"Nice catch, very extraordinary."
345876,steverowbotham,2009-05-28 21:37:00,1800," I'd hardly call those fins rotted, they're beat up and likely from the spawn, smallmouth spawn in water between 52-58 degrees, and Ahmic Lake should be between 58-62 right now. The fish should be on their beds now, some should be done their spawn.  That fish is otherwise healthy looking, the blotching wouldnt be causing it any harm.  The blotching is often caused by skin pigment hormones that are associated with stress ie. catch and release, livewell holding, spawn, but is not necessarily relevant to the fish's current state of health as the markings will stay for life.  I hope this helps.  Ahmic Lake seems to be especially bad for it, I've caught many smallies with blotching (although none as crazy as this one) I've caught the same fish off the same spot on two different years.  Same mushroom shaped blotch on his cheek"
