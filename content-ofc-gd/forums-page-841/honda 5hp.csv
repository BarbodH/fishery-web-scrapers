346206,Terry,2009-05-29 21:51:00,14456,"my kicker motor died  the bulb on the gas line is firm  the motor will start but dies seconds later and will not start for about 5 minutes then stalls again if I keep spraying gas into the carb it keeps running the float seems fine, filter seems ok, can't see any leaks in the lines I don't know how to check the fuel pump but I am starting to think that might be the problem  does anyone have any ideas and or is there anyone (cheap) around bradford that works on Honda outboards"
346218,Guidofisherman,2009-05-29 22:53:00,206,I have the same motor and generally they run great. I have had the same situation and each time it has been that the motor was starved for air. Make sure the valve on the top of the tank has not been accidentally closed or vibrated shut.
346224,Terry,2009-05-29 23:12:00,14456,yeah that was one of the first things I tried I even took the cap right off I checked all the lines and the gas filter I had carb cleaner and sprayed it
346225,Sinker,2009-05-29 23:16:00,8692,"I'd start with a new fuel filter. Mine did that to me too, and that's what it was. I had to keep pumping the ball to keep her running. It would start just fine after priming the bulb, then stall. A few minutes later it would start fine again. I had to wait for the fuel to get thru the clogged filter each time I started it.  S."
346228,Terry,2009-05-29 23:25:00,14456,"my ball stays firm...LOL always wanted to say that  and I could see the filter was full of gas, I too the line off after the filter and just touching the ball gas flowed through the filter.....  I tried most of the simple things..."

346232,Terry,2009-05-29 23:35:00,14456,"one per motor I have 2 motors so I do have 2 balls  thanks for asking brian  as in my first post, I always call it a bulb but bulb ball whatever you want to call it it's firm"
346233,PERCHER,2009-05-29 23:39:00,787,Maybe a stuck needle and seat?
346236,Terry,2009-05-29 23:43:00,14456,I unscrewed the screws and sprayed I really don't know how to check a seat...I am sure brian will have something smart to say about that too LOL  but maybe what do I do to check them
