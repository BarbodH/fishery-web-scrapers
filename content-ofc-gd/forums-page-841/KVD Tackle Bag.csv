Just browsing a little for a new bag cause I am not going to be carrying around that big Plano 737 box all summer, nor do i want a big scramble of plastic cases. Actually leaning more towards that Browning Barn Bag.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...tems#itemDetail  There's that KVD bag above.   MTBF"

346713,CLofchik,2009-06-01 01:10:00,854," Uh, they say exactly.  Start with a $40 bag. Add 100% markup because they have the word ""fishing"" in the title and throw in a tiny addon that costs them $2.63 to have sewn up in Cambodia. Add 25% royalty to get KVD's name on it.   Now if you want a decent pack that will last years AND carry everything & anything you could possibly need for a day:  One of these:  http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail....D=1243818468438  Filled with a few of these (unlike other Plano-esque boxes they have real hinges):  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...tems#itemDetail  If it makes you feel better find a local clothing alteration shop and have them embroider ""KVD Elitiest"" And there ya go.....others may have a ""Fishing Elite"" bag but yours will be the Elitiest!"
