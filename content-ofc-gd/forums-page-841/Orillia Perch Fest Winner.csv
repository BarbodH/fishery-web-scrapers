346035,Fish Farmer,2009-05-29 11:09:00,2234,"What a happy day for our buddy, we went and picked up his win yesterday. We gave him a shopping list for what he he needs for his new machine. I think he's going to Christen it this weekend.    "
346038,Spiel,2009-05-29 11:30:00,9065,That's a sweet looking rig for sure!  And to think I knew him when he was just another steelworker.
346051,Jer,2009-05-29 12:32:00,1426,"Nice machine.  How long does he have to leave the ""ORILLIA PERCH FESTIVAL GRAND PRIZE AWARD"" lettering on there? Just curious if there's an agreement on that and how they would enforce such a thing.  ...sure is a beauty though..."
346052,anders,2009-05-29 12:35:00,1168,"Congrats...that is awsome..  First prize for a perch tourney...Wow...thats awsome...was it total length, weight or amount?"
346058,Spiel,2009-05-29 12:51:00,9065, I believe it was a random draw for all participants.
346078,anders,2009-05-29 13:41:00,1168,Right on....thanks...and congrats on a sweet rig again.
346165,johnnyb,2009-05-29 18:39:00,3413,SWEEEEETTTT!!!!!  That's one nice ride    I wonder if it catches other fish besides perch?
346193,Governator,2009-05-29 20:45:00,879,"  If I won that boat I would care less, infact I'd be happy to promote them for life."

346244,Mattones,2009-05-30 00:56:00,587,I agree. I woukd be proud to show off the grand prize i won  :D  Great looking boat!!!
346247,pikehunter,2009-05-30 01:10:00,1659,"Congrats to your buddy Dave, great prize!  I would have no problem with the lettering on the hull at all! Why not let the world know how lucky you are."
346249,Fish Farmer,2009-05-30 01:26:00,2234,"As for leaving the decals on, they didn't say anything. We were thinking the same thing, but he's going to leave them on for awhile. How he won the boat, every day you fish you are aloud to enter one perch per day in the live release tank, doesn't matter the size, they check off your entr√©e ticket for that day and put your name in the drum. After the 3 week derby, they draw from that drum for the grand prize. Every year, about 8 guys in our group fish the Perch derby. They also release about 70 tagged Perch worth $500.00 to $5000.00. One of our guys also caught a $500.00 tag. I would say we had a good year. Some of our group  One of our guys with a winning $500.00 tag Perch    We put 8 days of steady perch fishing in. A lot of catch and release. It's not easy, we put our time in. But I can tell you we have a lot of fun. Great event for the family and all us kids"

346296,Terry,2009-05-30 10:19:00,14456,"now that is the way life should be , jobs get in the way of fishing yes I am jealous"
346371,fishboy,2009-05-30 15:50:00,550, sweet looking outfit...and what's the big deal if it's a tiller-too much extra space to move around?
