The north winds were pushing waves onto the pier so we opted to move furth in shore. Turned out to be a good plan B. Out of the wind, the sun is shining and the fish biting. We seemed to hit a wide variety of species again without any OOS  fish.     We both managed to find a decent take home meal. By 1pm. everything had shut down and we called it a day"
