346198,Bob Devine,2009-05-29 21:15:00,251,"I fished Thurs out of Leamington with good results. We landed 2 over 29"" with several between 25-28"". We dodged some rain and got caught in a few showers but the walleyes continued to cooperate. We fished 28-32 fow pulling harnesses and crawlers the best pattern was a Northland #5 baitfish image blade in perch pattern. The walleye season is going strong and will continue thru the summer months from Colchester to Leamington.  "
346202,Terry,2009-05-29 21:40:00,14456,nice going great looking fish
346264,trapshooter,2009-05-30 02:32:00,1234,"Two over 29 is a great day on any walleye lake!!  Do you keep those big ones, or let em go?"
346268,brifishrgy,2009-05-30 02:43:00,559, the 2nd pick is a release pick so I would guess releasin the biggins
346276,Bob Devine,2009-05-30 03:00:00,251,"Fortunately for me I have learned to catch enough walleyes and we have great surrounding waters (Det River-Erie and LSC) that I am very selective of the walleyes I keep. When I choose to keep them they are between 15""-18""."
346297,trapshooter,2009-05-30 10:41:00,1234,"Good for you Bob.  Hopefully your guests learn from your selective harvest practices.  I'm the same way, nothing over 18"" goes in the box."
346330,huey graphite,2009-05-30 13:03:00,362,Mmmm can't wait 'til those tasty critters head to the Eastern Basin.
346464,JPD,2009-05-31 01:15:00,296,Looks like a great time Bob... keep hammering them!
346465,Bob Devine,2009-05-31 01:20:00,251,It has been a great season JP. The Det River took a little while to heat up but it is still going well with limits of walleyes and all the silver bass you want right now. Erie is going strong and it is a blast watching those Off Shore boards go under like a bobber. I will be staying on Pelee Island from Wed-Sun next wk. It should look like this again!
