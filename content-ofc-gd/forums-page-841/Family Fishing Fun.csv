344966,Marty,2009-05-26 14:28:00,873,"For the Memorial Day holiday, the whole family headed out to a local farm pond for some panfish and bass fishing.  We also took my nephew Carson with us.  Carson had only fished one time as a very young child and asked to come along.   Of course, it wasn't a problem.   This pond is loaded with big bluegills and sunfish and yields the ocassional 5 or 6 pound bass.   Yesterday didn't give us a big one but it sure put out alot of fish.  Some of you have met Dawson, my 6 year old son.  He lives to fish (Sorry WFN).   He baits hooks and helps take the fish off and release them.  He just has to touch every fish that's caught.   Here he is with his big smile (and hat autographed by Dave Mercer) knowing the fish he caught on a tube was bigger than mine:    He had a blast:    Haley and Hannah, my 10 year old twins also got into the act.   They put a hurtin on the fish.   Here's Haley:      And Hannah:      Ally, my 8 year old, showed me how it's done:      Finally, Sarah, the 3 year old, liked to catch them but she didn't want to touch them:      One of the best parts of this trip was taking my nephew Carson.   He only fished once as a youngster but he's 10 now.   He had a smile the entire time.   He told me that he now wants to go fishing with us whenver we go.  Gotta love that (and he sure knows his football too):      It was a great day with the family.  I was so proud of all of them.   They didn't want to leave.   Can't wait to get back out there."
