346424,Leecher,2009-05-30 22:35:00,7832,I think I'll stick with trout butterfly if you don't mind Leechman
346440,bigugli,2009-05-30 23:26:00,6138,I've had sheephead chowder a few times when younger. No different than most white flesh chowders.

346500,CLofchik,2009-05-31 11:35:00,854,"I'm not a big fish eater, but I really really like saltwater black drum.  I figured I'd give the whistletrout a shot, hell they both look the same. Big mistake.......ugh don't eat sheepshead.  Yes it came from Erie.  Smoked carp wasn't bad, not great but not bad."

I befriended a black fellow that was targeting Sheepshead! he explained to me that pound for pound they were one of the best fighting (insert Bulldog) fish he had fished for!.. He showed me how he rigged and fished for them. He would keep a few for the table using different family recipes, one sticks out in my mind...

I still remember that Ol' Man and him spending the time teaching me how to fish for em... we talked many many times throughout that summer...  Would I eat them now? I would try them... But after years of negative feedback regarding Water Goat, I would be a little hesitant I think..  ..... I wonder what happened to that old man....  G"
