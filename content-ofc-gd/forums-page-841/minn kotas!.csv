So my buddy and i fished tilley lake for walleye dodging rain drops but did get pretty wet, and only got a 3.5lb smallie and release it and we wished we got a picture of it but wanted to get it back in the water asap. We decided to head to a different spot on the lake and i forgot to pull my minn kota motor up and i start going across the lake and i hear BANG! and i see my minn kota go flying into the water! what a bummer!! Is there any chemicals or any bad things that could poison the water or anything? If anyone finds a 40lb thrust minn kota in tilley let me know or if you know anyone with scuba gear that wants to go on a little search mission for a case of beer also let me know! Walmart also has minn kotas for pretty cheap, just bought a 30lb thrust $129.99. my mother told me there would be days like today!"

346633,Fishnwire,2009-05-31 20:43:00,983,Dropping one in the lake intentionally wouldn't be my recommended method of disposal...but I don't think you're doing any real harm in the grand scheme of things.  Will you employ a safety chain/strap in the future?
346635,pike slayer,2009-05-31 20:47:00,1177,"i certainly did not want to dump my minn kota in the lake, as soon as i got back to town i went to walmart and bought another one and thank god my battery didnt go with it hahaha! i do put a wire with a lock on my 9.9 but didnt on my minn kota, but i think im gonna from now on! im still looking for someone with scuba gear or a really good swimmer to go on a search mission for me though"
