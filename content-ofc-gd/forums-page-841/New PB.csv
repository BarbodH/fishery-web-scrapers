345606,frozen-fire,2009-05-28 01:19:00,542,wow...that thing has got a belly!  good job on the PB.
345608,cram,2009-05-28 01:23:00,1733,Very cool.  How do those guys fight?  I have never caught one.  Are they like a bass? (Jumping etc)?
345613,mattyk,2009-05-28 01:37:00,2110,"They don't jump, but they fight much harder than a black bass. They just pull line really hard and take long runs. Its an amazing fight and lots of fun, especially if you catch them on top water."

345649,mattyk,2009-05-28 11:37:00,2110,It been a while since a report. I was busy with finishing my dissertation. A hybrid is a cross between a striped bass and a white bass.
