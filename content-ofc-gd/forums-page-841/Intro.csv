My grandparents have a cottage on lake Kasshabog up in 15 north of havelock....been fishing there for a number of years....I have an aluminum boat w/ a johnson and just recently bought a minnkota to use while portaging for my canoe.....i go on a couple trips per year, last year to the ottawa river and shining tree (where i will def'n be returning in september).....had some great days on the water.  Ive set my 09 goals to land a musky, and to have cosistent success on walleye on my home lake.  Im also a avid hunter, deer, turkey, grouse, - So far this year i harvested a 21lb tom on my 4th hunt of this season and pending success after work today or tomorrow i will be eating my second tag.  Cheers and good luck in the 09 season,"
