I'm sure a bunch of you members have Jon boats and well I'm just looking to see some pictures of personalization to your Jon boat and also would like to hear some likes and dislikes about these boats. What would be better suited for a 10-14' boat, electric or gas motor. Things like that, just trying to get a idea on what to save up for once a job comes along."
346730,Musky or Specks,2009-06-01 02:12:00,2710,Totally deck it out like a bass boat. build a casting platform up front with a foot control electric and 9.9 on the back. Great boats for small water. A lot of my early musky fishing was done from a jon. Used it in the Kawarthas and also on Moira and Stocco.
