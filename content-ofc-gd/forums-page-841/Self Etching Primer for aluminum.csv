346274,ch312,2009-05-30 02:52:00,1590,"to paint an aluminum enclosed trailer that is already painted would this self etching stuff make it possible to go over the existing paint? or would it be best to sand the original paint?  ive found a few good deals on black trailers, but i want a lighter color so its not as hot in the summer..."
346300,Sinker,2009-05-30 10:48:00,8692," If its already painted, you don't need to use the primer. Just give the existing paint a light sand with fine paper and have atter. I painted my boat 4 years ago, and its holding up good so far. I just went over it with the sander and slapped the paint to it. The self etching primer is for bare metal only.  Sinker"
