346179,John,2009-05-29 19:43:00,2956," If you do a search there has been quite a few threads on LOB's. Predominantly a smallie and laker lake, pike are there but few and far between. Can be a scary lake in a yak.....be careful out there."
346199,johnnyb,2009-05-29 21:19:00,3413,"You're pretty close to Mary, which will give you access to Spider and Penfold Lakes, by following the creek that heads toward hwy. 11.  Perfect set up for the yak, and should be a pile of willing pike back in the creek and smaller lakes.  Just my $0.02"
346267,Kenny G,2009-05-30 02:43:00,118,"I only fish it in the winter. Catch lakers and the odd whitie. Have heard from locals their are big pike in there. Tons of smallies, watch the wind out there. It can pick up at the drop of a hat. Penn lake in Huntsville can be good for pike and Paint lake has some decent pike. Tightlines Kenny G."
