346188,pike slayer,2009-05-29 20:20:00,1177,i bought the $59.99 frabil net with the red shaft at crappy tire this spring. i've used it a few times and its a nice quality net that is large yet compact. the net is rubber coated and helps protect the fish. my only complaint is the hooks still get caught in the net and are hard to get out when the fish starts thrashing in the net but is still not as bad as old nets.  http://www.frabill.com/index.php/nav-produ...;category_id=17
346217,bassjnkie,2009-05-29 22:45:00,1101,I was looking at the same one the other day. Thanks for the review it sounds like a good net.

346332,cranks bait,2009-05-30 13:21:00,721," I bought this net last year.  It works great.  Has had several 36 inch pike in it and a ton of bass, sadly not very many eyes.  I wanted to get an all rubber one but could not find it.  The pike and lures still get caught up a bit if you are not careful, but it is much better than other nets I have used.  I also put an extention on it so I could reach out further as I fish alone a lot and use long rods.  It's held up real well to the fish and weather.  I can highly recommend it."
346414,Victor,2009-05-30 21:45:00,1609,"I dont' know how your old net looks like, but if it's still functional, have you considered to just replace the nylon mesh with a rubber one? They sell them at Lebaron, I'm planning to do the same for mine this year.  Nylon + trebles = trouble lol."
346417,bassjnkie,2009-05-30 21:53:00,1101,"Thanks Victor that was one of my options. The thing is my net looks like it took a hit from a Mack truck.    So I have to go new. Pigeontroller, Frabill is the way I would like to go, but I will look into Beckman nets. Thanks"
