346157,blarg,2009-05-29 18:17:00,289,"  I wonder what all of the steaks and hamburgers and pork chops think of statements like these.  You do know how most of our for food animals are raised and killed right? If not maybe you should check it out.  What about all those fish that are held out of the water for photos while they suffocate?  Or the ones that are released back into the water to suffer a slow death perhaps while being picked apart by other predators...how cruel of us.  Im sure you have never caught a young fish that was hooked too deep and died...you must be special.  By all accounts the seal population is in no danger, and making a distinction based upon the age of an animal is absolutely ridiculous, you think those year old pigs wanted/deserved to die any more than a few days old wild animal that hasn't been kept in a cage standing in its own feces and pumped full of chemicals for it's short life?  Also, your views on the inuit are completely wrong, they did at one time use all of the animal, that is no longer the case, i've seen it first hand.  It's quite clear you've been drinking the liberal urbanite koolaid for too long.  Frankly its saddening to see comments like these from a sportsman, what we do to fish is no different than what a hunter does to a deer or a sealer to a seal, you may choose to believe that it's different, but you're simply wrong.  It's life and death, we are the apex predator, we use animals for all sorts of things and have for a very very long time, there is nothing wrong with that as long as it's sustainable.  In most parts of this country people are still close enough to there environment to understand that, the endless suburb that is southern Ontario has unfortunately become disconnected leading to views like yours imo.  Finally I would suggest you look into the european fur industry, or veal, or even bull fighting! perhaps you will see that this is all politics and maybe you will switch your brand of kool aid."

If you walked around and mashed fish over the head you would not call it fishing. There is a giant difference between the seals the Innuit eat and the harp seals of the East Coast. One has nothing to do with the other. Killing Harp Seals is part of why our cod stocks disappeared. Harp seals eat predators of cod 10X more often than they eat cod, which if you know how to break it down, the Harp seals saved 30 cod for each one they ate. The EU did not 'get in our business'. They just said they were not buying the pelts anymore. It is their right. Good. I am tired of subsidizing idiotic harvest practices. It was costing Canadian tax payers millions of dollars each year to have our Coast Guard ice breakers help the 'hunters' get to their quarry. We have far more pressing economic concerns now. You would not support the Coast Guard doing it for commercial fishers would you??  Now the Gov Gen is the representative of the Queen. The Queen has made her opinion clear on the east coast Harp Seals.  However, the GG's timing on the matter served to appear acceptance on the harp seal harvest, when in fact it was not the intention. She will likely be answering to the Queen for her poor timing. The Harp Seal pups were not harvested for their meat, but for their pelts...the flesh was left to waste."

Seems all your info comes from the P3TA videos of the seal hunt which are from a different era. Seals are not clubbed these days. Nor are the young harvested. They are shot, mature seals only and all flesh must be harvested. Also, coming from a long, long line of cod fisherman, I have seen the damage seals do to the cod. They eat the liver only. Which predator of the cod does the seal harvest? It's not the seal harvest that has caused the demise of the cod fishery, it was the Federal 'scientists' who allowed the large quotas for the draggers what not only harvested millions of tonnes of fish but raped the sea bed, left ghost nets, and dumped quota fish and any by-catch. The fishermen told the govt. for years that the cod were getting smaller and fewer, but they would not listen. In my honest opinion, you are very intelligent and have many good points on a lot of topics on this board. But please get the facts straight on the seal hunt before spieling.  Curt"

At face value I believe the GG was being respectful of the Inuit tradition and good on her.  I believe many board members here would hesitate a raw taste of seal heart---She's got jam.  I am honest and believe the east coast seal harvest to be just as part of our Canadian heritage as any of our Ontario hunting and fishing.  We don't want to look to closely at other parts of our dealings with animals cause in My opinion some killing of horses for their flesh makes the seal hunt look like a childrens t-ball game--just fewer celebs involved.

345972,bigfish1965,2009-05-29 01:32:00,3382,"The young are absolutely harvested. The white coats are not..but a young pup sheds its white coat at about 2 to 3 weeks of age...usually within 48 hours. So over the weekend a seal pup goes from off limits to legal. Seals are still clubbed with the hackapic. Shooting often damages the pelt. The adults escape too quickly. Check the harvest numbers from the DFO...while only 50,000 seals were harvested this year, the vast majority are always young of the year. The cod demise was entirely of our making, however human induced imbalance in the hunter/prey population ALWAYS negatively affects the prey. Why would the DFO refuse to allow neutral third party observation and recording of the harvest if it had nothing to hide? Why have hundreds of charges been laid against these guys for illegal killings? I do not get any info from either the pro or anti side. They both have their own agenda. I have read the DFO reports and come to my own conclusions. I am against my tax dollars subsidizing an unsustainable practice...one that nearly the entire world is opposed to, costs us millions of dollars and which generates less than 6,000 temporary jobs. I'd much rather see my tax dollars be used to buy out the licenses and retrain and send these guys to school if they wish. It is no different than shark finning...an irresponsible waste of a natural resource. The harvest of any animal for only a minor portion of their carcass is not acceptable use in ANY resource plan.  This is not what the Innuit do. They use as much of the seal as possible...inluding the pelt, flesh, tendons, and even the bones. They understand the balance far better than we do."

346065,Headhunter,2009-05-29 13:05:00,5703,"I think Rex Murphy said it best in last nights news cast. Video is not available yet, but here's the transcript. Way ta go GG!  Seal of Disapproval Rex Murphy Point of View May 28, 2009  So the Governor General goes to Rankin Inlet, goes on a seal hunt, participates in an Inuit feast, and - from some quarters - gets ripped for her ""stupidity"" and her ""immorality.""  Those words are insolent and ignorant: only someone imperiously smug could describe Michaëlle Jean's participation in the feast - and the explicit and implicit respect for the people that her participation signaled - as either stupid or immoral.  It's fast becoming undebatable that the smartest, best thing Paul Martin did as Prime Minister was his appointment of Michaëlle Jean as Governor General. She can swoosh into an NAC gala with the best of the 'fashionistas,' chat with President Obama in prefect ease, and sit comfortably on the ground in a track suit, wielding a ulu, and sample the uncooked heart of that night's dish of fresh seal.  It's ""disgusting,"" cried some - including the P3TA brigade, who enroll such luminaries as Pamela Anderson among their house philosophers, and who have made such ""tasteful"" comparisons as animal farming to the Holocaust. They actually ran a ""Holocaust on your Plate"" campaign. Disgusting is a word P3TA and Pamela have lost the right to use.  Actually the Governor General was a model of deep courtesy in her actions and visit. How much we talk the talk of ""diversity,"" ""respect for traditions,"" and regard for aboriginal peoples. Yet here we have the head of state of Canada - not just flitting by, but staying over, participating, mixing in depth with the people of the far north. The response? We have all sorts of superior people calling her ""too bizarre,"" citing her actions as ""bloodlust,"" ""Neanderthal,"" ""offensive"" and insulting her as stupid and immoral.  Stand back a little from those descriptions, and it is impossible not to see that - effectively - that's what they're calling the Inuit. It was their feast, their practices, their customs - and Michaëlle Jean was their guest. I guess, then, the claim to recognize diversity, to respect the traditions of ""others"" doesn't extend, for the Governor General's mainly animal rights critics, to the Inuit. That ""diversity"" is a ""diversity"" too far.  She helped to skin a seal. She ate a portion of raw seal heart. Ooh, disgusting. Well, it isn't to those who have been doing so for generations. It isn't for those who find a living in hunting seals. It isn't for those living in some of the remotest, harshest places on the planet, and who are patronized every second day for their ""wonderful culture"" - except when someone from the outside actually comes to visit and participates in that wonderful culture.  The people of the North - or the east coast - are not telling the European Union what to eat, or caterwauling about ""rack of lamb"" on the menus of the rest of the world. No, it is always some superior sensitive souls down south - aided by Hollywood dimbells - who seek to impose their progressive view of the world on those far less comfortable and far less well off.  The Governor General should be given one of her own medals for this. In an age when you can't get a politician to say a clear thing to save his life - or do something, for once, without ambiguity - her participation, and endorsement, this week of an ancient, diverse culture, is a act of exceptional and clear bravery. She knew the whirlwind she'd kick up, and she didn't step back from it.  She actually liked the people she was visiting; more, she respected them and showed her respect by action.  Good for her.  For The National, I'm Rex Murphy."
346072,troutologist,2009-05-29 13:19:00,951,Mr. Murphy hit the nail of the head in my opinion.  This wasn't about endorsement of the seal hunt at all. A welcome change that a senior Govt official would practice what is preached versus do as I say not what I do.  Something like this will go a long way in building relations between Ottawa and the Inuit.  In my opinion an increasingly rare good news story for the Canadian Govt.

I always take one step back when it comes to any group that is so certain that their point of view is the right one and everyone else should get in line---Self righteousness has gotten the world into more trouble than any single issue.  Back to P3TA--they are a one issue marketing team---tearing at the heartstrings of the too busy to be informed crowd--all's we need is a baby animal to cry on que.  It's the same theory as Michelin having babies in their tire commercials---Don't you know that you don't love your children unless you have Michelins.
