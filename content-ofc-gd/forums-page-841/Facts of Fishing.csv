346598,danbouck,2009-05-31 17:22:00,4380,I don't think Dave would like it to be downloaded!  He does have some on his website http://www.factsoffishing.com/

346613,CLofchik,2009-05-31 18:08:00,854,"Presumably the argument is you lose the commercials, i.e. sponsors.  But then again 99% of the content on fishing shows is a commercial anyway."
346615,Zubris21,2009-05-31 18:22:00,563," I understand what you're saying, but the shows can still be aired on TV with not detriment to sponsorship, not to mention a lot of online shows (see myoutdoortv) still have commercials inbedded."
346620,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-31 18:48:00,3761," He's telling the truth lol. I see those Evinrude commercials way to much on The Scott Martin Challenge. Hey, just as a side question FFF, is the episode where Dave and Scott face off on myoutdoortv yet?"
346643,tonyle87,2009-05-31 21:22:00,26," not true, even if i do get the urge to buy a shimano stradic after watching every episode"
