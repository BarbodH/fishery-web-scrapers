I understand that the fishing is excellent if you know were to find them.  No, I am not going to ask where to fish, LOL. But, would like to know if anyone out there has a copy of a Topograpghical Map of Lake Manitouwabing that they could e-mail me.  I know I can buy a very good one from BackRoad Maps - ""Fishing Maps"" but when I contacted them they will not guarantee that I will get it in time.  If you do, please send to [emailÂ protected]  Thank You Very Much in advance.  PS - I know that I will catch fish whether or not I find a map, but it would save a lot of scouting around as I am only going to be there for 3 days.  Thanks Again"

Here's one little hint for ya -- look for the big shoal in the middle of the lake...good luck!!!"

346654,djcarter,2009-05-31 22:03:00,4, Thanks - Your right - Its a great place for maps. Found maps for four others lakes I also fish.
346685,djcarter,2009-05-31 23:40:00,4,"I have not checked out what is in season and what is not, up there yet.  But, you can be assured that I will, before I get there.  I am a ""Catch & Release""  angler anyway.  That Pike you are holding in your picture is not a bad size.  JUST KIDDING, LOL I usually fish for trophies, and rarely remove them from the ""Cradle'. - Thanks !"
