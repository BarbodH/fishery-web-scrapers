345966,steverowbotham,2009-05-29 01:28:00,1800, what he said
345976,sonicpike,2009-05-29 01:57:00,10,Where else would you recommend for pickeral and pike... close to Barrie?
345979,BillM,2009-05-29 01:59:00,17367, GBay without a doubt.  Shouldn't have any issues catching pike this time of year.
345980,sonicpike,2009-05-29 02:08:00,10,Gbay sounds good.... but I wouldnt know where to start. The last thing that I want to do is spend the day on the water without a fish. Any advice?

346037,bigugli,2009-05-29 11:23:00,6138,The bays off the channel to honey harbour often hold good #s of pike.
346048,12footspringbok,2009-05-29 12:15:00,459,"I was up to the big chute on may 18, so the upper side of the severn in that area. It was nice because they had not yet opened that section of the trent so there was hardly any boat traffic. Anyways i know some good spots in the fall for walleye but not in the spring. We tried lots of different spots that i though looked good on the chart, with not much luck except for rock bass and sunfish. At around 12:30 we decided to try one last spot and we ended getting in to a few nice walleyes and a few good sized crappie to boot. So to answer your question they are biting up there for sure just keep trying new spots. We caught all of our fish on green go get'ers with worms, in about 10-15ft of water. Hope this helps."
346242,sonicpike,2009-05-30 00:50:00,10,Hello all... Thanks for the advice. I am not sure if I will be hitting Gloucester this weekend... but when I do ... I will post the results here.
346250,misfish,2009-05-30 01:32:00,29133,"You are from Barrie and you want to travel? So many spots and fish to fish here on Simcoe.Yes walleye,pike perch, crappie ,whities, lakers.  RIGHT IN YOUR BACK YARD."
346277,Rizzo,2009-05-30 03:00:00,4754,"wow this is coincidental. I just turned on my computer to get the directions Misfish pm'ed me a few days ago to a launch for Gloucester Pool and I see this thread. We will be after pike tomorrow, not those pesky walleyes. Hopefully I'll have something to report although the negative reviews here are starting to scare me! There is a small chance we fish GBay out from Waubashene instead. I'd like to say what kind of boat I'll be in but I'm going with a friend and we're using his boat. I believe it is a Ranger(?) but not sure. I am sure its wwwaaaaayyyy bigger and better than mine. Lets try this, if you do Gloucester Pool Saturday and see 3 guys in a Ranger come say hello"
