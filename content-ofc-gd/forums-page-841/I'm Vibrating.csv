Joe"

I will surely miss all of my Canadian and American friends that will be attending, I haven't said anything until now because I was hoping there'd be a chance... but alas... it's not in the cards for me this June. September may look better!  Someone please drink some dark Cuban Rum for me!  I'll be looking forward to all the reports and pics!!!  I'm gonna miss y'all!!!"

345717,doubleheader,2009-05-28 13:56:00,497,"Lakair morning  Early in the morning, I’m the only one awake, I like to sneak out to our deck, And gaze upon the lake.  The leaves they rustle just a bit, The water laps the shore, My mind fills with memories, Of years past and more  Not sure where all the days have gone Nor the number yet to see Just lost in treasured memories, Of how it used to be  I’d like to think you’re here with me Right here, on this painted deck Is this what calls me to this place? Is this why I make this trek?  The sun will rise half hour from now Everyone up and about But these moments belongs to only us For that there is no doubt  See you all soon"
345720,TJQ,2009-05-28 14:00:00,7806,Awesome poem... all except the up before dawn part.. lol
