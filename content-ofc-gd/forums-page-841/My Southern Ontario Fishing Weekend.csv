345233,Mike the Pike,2009-05-27 00:54:00,3421, Thanks again Dan Ryan keeps talking about it over and over just one problem he likes your boat much more than mine now.  We need to do something about his sea sickness though it only happens to him on Lake O.  I now find other species boring to reel in man Salmon have a lot of Zipppppppp

Fishing was not the best but the company sure was and it was a great time on the water. Managed some fish too, Sorry i couldnt have stayed and chatted a little bit more, promised my friend to take them out fishing before i knew i was going to end up going to Bronte, it was kind of a last minute thing haha. Maybe next time."

We were thrilled you chose to come out here to do some fishing.  Great seeing both of you and having a chance to meet Ryan.  Looks like you had an awesome day on Lake Ontario... the pictures and stories will be around for a lifetime I am sure...  Enjoy every moment, they pass by way too quickly... and to Ryan... (Lake O can make the best of us a little queesy at times, it will not always be that way I assure you)  Cheers  Jen ( Bernadette)"
346334,lovetofish,2009-05-30 13:35:00,500,Great report!!!  The look on both of your faces says you'll never forget!  Awesome!!!   lovetofish

344624,Mike the Pike,2009-05-25 12:40:00,3421,This year my annual fishing trip to Quinte on the May long weekend is no more so after talking to Percher he suggested I come down to Southern Ontario for some arm burning Slammin Salmon so we decided to drive the 606kms to Dan's  Ryan(My Son) and arrived Friday morning after 6 hours and 5 minutes of Driving from South Shore Montreal.  It was a little late to go out for Salmon so we went fishing for cats on the Grand River in Dunneville.  It was nice to see Bernadette again and finally meet Steve Fishmaster.  We picked up some STINKY BAIT  and proceeded to the fishing grounds.       The only cat of the day caught by my Son Ryan smile tells it all he knows how to hold cats As for me I am working on that.     Captain Percher.   Captain Perchers catch of the day my son also caught a huge bolt weighing about 5 to 6lbs catching that was exciting.I see where people like to throw there garbage.  Day two started off like this.  This shot is for you Slowpoke this thing allows you to arrive on time.   Well Slowpoke set a new record Saturday only arriving 8 mins late this time  Mr Bermuda shorts did not stay dressed like this too long as it was rather chilly Saturday Morning.   The insults started flying about Mike the Pike so I could tell Memart and Slowpoke had missed me so much.  Thankfully Perchers boat halls a s s so we just left those boys behind.It was great to finally meet Marko and good to see Lexxington again .Paul thanks for taking Marko out on the big Pond.  Thanks to Percher for making it happen.   Hi Ho Silver move out the way you poopy Canada Geese.    We got out Percher set up everything and we didn't have to wait long he put us on fish.  DOUBLE HEADER!!!!      This is what we came here for this is the biggest fish I have ever caught in my life. This was the same for my son.My first Salmon since 1981 when I caught an 11lb Coho years ago fishing with Percher's Dad.I can't thank Dan enough my son was so excited and pumped a moment that will last a lifetime in my mind.  For many of you this kind of fishing is close by so enjoy your resourse its a long drive for us. Looking forward to our next trip to the big pond.      Oh what a day to remember.  Sunday time to go home but not without my yearly stop at BPS.  Dad can you buy this and that and this and that.................              We took our time getting home .  I made a detour off the 401 and met up with CCMT (Cliff)for a coffee at his house. We met his daughters and little Sydney who is just a happy child and was proud to show us her tackle box she won last year a fishing tournament.We missed out on seeing Bly cause she was away so perhaps next time.  Thanks for the Java Cliff great to see ya again.  Thanks again to Percher for putting us on some nice fish.  Mike the Pike

344866,SlowPoke,2009-05-26 07:27:00,2984," Eight minutes late. Had I known you wanted to see me so bad, I wouldn't have come! And why are you so focused on my legs?"
344874,Spiel,2009-05-26 10:48:00,9065,That's one hell of a road trip.      Sorry I didn't get down there myself but it just wasn't in the cards for me.
344877,b2kptbo,2009-05-26 10:58:00,1505,"Looks like you and Ryan had an action packed weekend, beauty report thanks..."
344885,Greencoachdog,2009-05-26 11:21:00,8163,"Great report and pics Mike!!!  Good on Dan for putting you and Ryan on those very nice fish!!!  Did you keep those fish to eat?  It looks like you've read my sig in a couple of those pics, maybe you should show it to Ryan so he can read it too."
344905,Mike the Pike,2009-05-26 12:04:00,3421, Actually I was looking forward to seeing you Bryan.  I just rubbed it in because you mentionned in previous reports that you have problems getting up for fishing these days arriving late.  And you did tell me in previous posts you like the time shots.  I noticed the shorts not the legs  See ya on the next trip
344983,trapshooter,2009-05-26 14:50:00,1234,Looks like a great trip with your son Mike.  Thanks for the report.
345044,SlowPoke,2009-05-26 17:48:00,2984," I wanted to see you too, Mike Working nights, I force myself to go to bed and try to wake up for 4AM. Normally I'm not getting to bed until at least that time. My usual pre-fishing sleep is normally an exercise of tossing and turning and the best I can hope for is a nap! Eight minutes late is pretty good considering I drove 100 miles and stopped for a coffee for Captain Rob and I. I stopped by Dan's on the way home to say goodbye but you weren't there. I had saved up a ton of quality insults, I'll make up for it next time. -Brian"
345051,fishnsled,2009-05-26 18:34:00,3520,Great report Mike.  Good on ya Dan for making it all happen.  Memories for a lifetime.
