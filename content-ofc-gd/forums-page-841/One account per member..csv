Setting up an additional user id/member name with result in immediate removal from the board.  Most of these second accounts are used for spamming, trolling or getting around ModQ, all of which are unacceptable.   There.  I said it."
345366,Spiel,2009-05-27 13:59:00,9065, Actually you typed it.  Reviewing the board rules might be a good time killer for the bored and the forgetful (like me).

345698,Spiel,2009-05-28 13:10:00,9065,"  No you can keep it Joe, I'll delete mine. TJ will also have to delete his Fishergirl account."
