345887,frozen-fire,2009-05-28 22:08:00,542,it's confirmed he drowned... i believe divers found him today.  very sad...
345888,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-28 22:14:00,10439,"I have run into this ""waters mine"" mind set plenty of times fishing steelies on Ontario and even New York. Seems people think that because they got there first they own the water. Doesn't matter that there are only two people fishing a hole that will comfortably fit a dozen or more without being crowded. Some people are just   and there is nothing you can do about it ""legally""  Solopaddler and I even had it happen in Alaska last fall and the   was a guide. We told the local CO who came to check our licenses later that day. As luck would have it   guide guy just happend to be heading down river at the time so it was waaaaaaaay easy to describe him to the CO.    She took after him and gave him her card and said for him to call her as she needed to talk to him. Very professional not to dress him down in front of his guests. I gather he was read the riot act later though. They are pretty serious about guide conduct in Alaska."
345893,big guy,2009-05-28 22:26:00,414,"  Yes indeed, very sad for the family. Far too young.  Thank god it didn't end being my buddies brother."
345922,wuchikubo,2009-05-28 23:54:00,1114, May have to wait another day or two. Police have been notified and mentioned that they may look into it.  Sad about the angler on Pigeon
345932,Greencoachdog,2009-05-29 00:12:00,8163,"  Glad to hear the authorities have been notified, it was the right thing to do!   Very sad about the angler on Pigeon, I'm sure if he'd been wearing a PFD he'd be alive today."
345994,mikeh,2009-05-29 02:50:00,824,"Considering that there was a task force headed by Barbara Hall to investigate incidents against anglers, I'm sure the authorities will be at his door asking him questions about the incident. I hope people don't stop fishing because of people like this.  I think people have the idea that there kids and grand kids want to be able to catch fish in the future off there waterfront properties and feel that if fishermen keep everything they catch that the lake will be fished out,this might explain some of the hostilities people have had.  I also think that anybody who has fished infront of someones dock or fished a shoreline has experienced people saying or doing things to try and make them move regardless of race ( one of my favourites is when they let the dog bark at you for 15 minutes while they are in the area and don't tell it to keep quite) . I had one guy make a comment to me that I probably could have called the cops about and said I was scared but I chose to just keep working the shoreline and not let it ruin my day of fishing."

346016,Blue_Axela,2009-05-29 05:18:00,88,"I'm not surprised this happened...I know how it feels like to be of asian decent and out on the lakes in a smaller boat (canoe, 12 or 14 footer).  While I agree that there was no specific mention of race, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why they were singled out and preyed on.  I doubt the cottager would approach the boat if they were Americans (who pretty much take out all the panfish they catch...on my lake anyways).  Sad."
346017,Greencoachdog,2009-05-29 05:32:00,8163,"  You're correct, it doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to figure it out (DIDJ'A GET THAT PART CRAM?)  ... as for the Americans taking all the panfsh they catch... they must be from Ohio!!!  ... a 12"" Bass is a ""trophy fish"" in Ohio!!!"
346024,Terry,2009-05-29 10:03:00,14456,"I still don't know  I have to get pretty close to a boat before I can tell what race people are. if I think I see a person keeping an OOS fish and I move my boat over to theirs, I am well on my way and committed to talking to them before I can  tell what race they are and doesn't play into the fact that I am going to confront them frankly I have fished for crappie and had another boat maybe 15 feet away and didn't know (or care) that    they were a different race till they started talking and the only thing that bugged me was, they might be giving good fishing tips and I didn't know what they were saying LOL"

And after spending 4 days in a hut this winter with Terry, I can guarrantee that he listening for tips! STILL LMAO!!!! In life there is always two or three sides to a story. I am far less than pleased at the side of the story being told here, but will resrve any further judgement, until the other two sides are made public. HH"

Let's call in the human rights thought police. I said it earlier, I've been screamed at, threatened, and told to leave countless areas. Must be because I am white. The problem with this is that when people actually do make threats due to race things like this look like crying wolf. He never said any racists names that I could see in any post but it FELT like it was racially motivated despite there being no evidence. Racism is wrong, just as wrong is crying racism when there was no evidence of it, only feelings and assumptions.  The guy was a first class idiot and the cops should have been called then and there if they were that worried. Welcome to the world of fishing, there will always be someone who doesn't like what you do."
346137,addy79,2009-05-29 16:46:00,573, the thought of ANY ONE of our members  interpreting these racial undertones and agression as anything less than dispicable is disturbing to me. I'd start tossin my believer into his boat if i ever saw anything like that! hope the fine the pants off of em!
346161,cram,2009-05-29 18:22:00,1733,"i ask again - where were the racial undertones???  i mean, its HORRIBLE what that guy did, and he certainly deserves a visit from the police, but i still don't get the racial part.  I mean, would the same thing have happened if the guys weren't catching/keeping any fish?  That area has a small group of cottages....i'd hate for that small group of people to be labeled racists (and ganged up on by the people on this board)"
346163,Blue_Axela,2009-05-29 18:30:00,88," They aren't being ganged up on because they are racist.  They are being ganged on because they are idiot rednecks.  Relax, the whole idea of bringing everyone's boat out to Cameron Lake was just a thought.  You'll be safe this weekend and the next.   I'm kidding!  You do have a point and its valid.  The idiot didn't call anyone a chink.  But it goes back to stereotyping and it doesn't only apply on the water."
346172,wuchikubo,2009-05-29 19:08:00,1114," My friends that were on the receiving end of this incident have not been the ones indicating any racism remarks, it's been the media that has been pushing for a racial part. My friends had made it clear that they feel that it was an isolated incident (cottager) and not the area. They have repeatedly mentioned how nice everyone in the area were.  Please leave the racial card out of this argument, it is more about the illegal actions the individual committed and yes, the local police are now involved and trying to get the other side's story.  Thanks for trying to keep things civilized."
346173,Terry,2009-05-29 19:16:00,14456,agreed  now are we all going fish there on sunday to say hi to the cottagers and do a little fishing  bring cameras

My dad came up to me today after I got home from work and told me that yesterday on the evening news (cantonese), they mentioned an attack on boaters fishing near Fenelon Falls. Once he said that someone tried cutting anchor line, I knew it was the same incident as was posted by hearingfish. Felt bad, cause my dad told me to try and not head out as often in the canoe... it's not safe even on the water, and if I do choose to go, i should try and go with more people if possible."

345591,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-05-28 00:34:00,0,it doesn't matter if it's racist or not. it's a terrible thing to do to a fellow angler.
345617,fishing,2009-05-28 01:49:00,167,"This is an incident I saw a while ago.  A man kept about a dozen or so pan fish around 7'' in length. Not too far from him, a young couple was fishing with their daughter, caught a small sunfish, about 6'' in size, they kept the fish. The man started shouting at them, ""Do not keep that fish, that's too small, that's why we do not have big fish any more.""  Does it make sense?  The man fished until dark, kept about 3 dozens or so pan fish and went home. Who did more harm to the fishery. The man with 3 dozens of 7'' fish, or the family with one 6'' fish? I saw this type of thing happen more than 3 times with my own eyes.  I only thought about them today, after the Cameron incident, that in all 3 cases that I SAW IN PERSON, the people who asked others to release the fish are actually the people who had kept and/or will keep much more fish later on, this MAY also include tiny fish. I am not saying that the man and the lady from Cameron Lake are the same since I do not know them. But I do have pictures of the guy who accused and ""attacked"" others more than once, displaying fish he kept. The fish were as dinky as 6"" in size according his own photos.  A lot of people here are nice and do C&R. But not those 2 or 3 people that I happened to bump in."

345626,holdfast,2009-05-28 04:23:00,1813," WOW a Whopper of a story!   I still maintain that the incident were two peeved off cottagers that figure the lake and fish are theirs.  So Happened the Perpetrators were Asian.  Obviously the Story got Ratted to an Asian News Paper.  I don't know the lake at all, but would I be right saying its a small Lake full of full time Cottagers.  Here's a story, I went looking all evening for a lake to fish and ended on a small lake somewhere not to far from Barrie.  I found a Boat launch and checked for a shoreline for a camp fire and tent.  No way Hose, too many cottages so I ended up tenting and camp firing beside the Boat Launch.  That night there were two gun shots, obviously trying to scare me off.  Next morning in my grogginess I heard about a half Dozen voices outside the tent talking about me.  I got out of the tent in my Skiffies, Knocked over a Whiskey Bottle and bid them Good Morning.  Their Snobby faces were priceless.  Point of my story, I wanted to fish, but to them I was an Invader. Oh, and I'm White"
345630,crappieperchhunter,2009-05-28 09:43:00,2582,"Some people are very protective of there ""home"" waters. I have even heard stories of well respected members of this board asking posts on this board about fishing on there ""home"" waters to be pulled by the mods.  To me this whole story is nothing more then that.  Not saying I agree with that went down, cause I don't. Just saying some people react that way to these things."
345632,Jer,2009-05-28 10:35:00,1426,"  No, you wouldn't be right. The lake is part of the Trent-Severn Waterway, hardly a small, private cottage lake."
345637,bigugli,2009-05-28 10:57:00,6138,"There are a lot of arrogant people on the lakes. They believe they own the fish and water.  I've seen signs posted as ""NO Fishing, Spawning Area"", yet they have a line from their dock into that location. Another   who hops on his jetski and does circles around the boat until you leave. One individual likes to launch golf balls from his dock at anglers in ""his"" bay.  One cottager used to cut rock markers set up by a local lodge for years until someone got him on tape. Not one of these people believe they are doing anything wrong."
345651,spinnerbaitking,2009-05-28 11:44:00,1622,"We live in a Mennonite area. the one local lake I fish they will go out and fill the bottom of the boat with panfish, mostly sunfish and then take hours to clean them, they use it for canning cheap salmon, maybe I could lone them to you and we could rent them a bus to get there, as much as I hate to see that there seems to be lots of sunfish every year, Richard Racism or just plane stupid"

I guess in a perfect world we would have caring/respect and tolerance for others but...think that it was only a few days ago young Mike's school was in lockdown.  I wish I had the answer but in these days of rush/rush--make more $$$---live larger than your pocketbook--my job may not be there tommorow---have put stresses on all ---even though self inflicted.

345709,bigfish1965,2009-05-28 13:47:00,3382,"Look..there is one thing plain and simple that stands out to me. The idiot involved was in violation of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act  as noted in this link. It was also likely a violation of the Federal Shipping Act. This person is in for a world of punishment if the police catch up to them. If we simply blow this off, when does it end? Was is racial? I don't know, but I would lay 3 to 1 that yes it was. We are ALL ANGLERS. No matter where we are or where we are from. It is our right to fish in full compliance and protection of the law. My experience as a Guardian with the MNR is that nothing makes an idiot stop doing stupid things faster than a camera. The uniform always made them curious... the camera made them run. If you are being harassed or witness another angler being harassed...take pictures! Lots of them. It does not even matter who is in the right...take a bunch of pictures. If words are loud enough to be heard, switch your camera to movie mode and get some of that too. Many of you may remember about a year and a half back when a member had taken a pic of a musky poacher and posted it here. It was not long before the MNR and OPP were calling. They do read this board every day. I do not in any way suggest confrontation for those not experienced or comfortable with it. My job puts me in that position every day so I am pretty handy at settling issues quickly. The police are obligated to answer calls.This was a physical and dangerous altercation and was indeed worthy of a 911 call."
345710,quickme,2009-05-28 13:47:00,261,"in a way it is comforting for the ""minority"" fisherpeople ( since we are trying to be politically correct) that there are members here that find these types of situations insulting and uncalled for also.  IMHO i think the best way to elimate this is just to educate our younger fisherpeople that we are all equal and we are all out there to enjoy something we love.   I've experienced this for over 30 years, has anything changed...  maybe a little...  will it continue?...  Maybe....   hearing some of these comments from fellow fisherpeople ( okay this is getting over used!) we are moving in the right direction.  I hope my 18 month old little boy will never have to experience ""nip tipping"" stories or "" get off my lake CH**K""...  Hope to see some of you on the lake!  Let have fun out there!"
345741,wuchikubo,2009-05-28 14:39:00,1114,"Yes, my friend had told me that it would make the evening news as the media were all over it once a local fishing club representative got notified. I've not seen the news clip but have been told by my friend that his intentions were NOT to stir up any problems other than to make it aware to anglers that there are some disrespectful people out there.  He tried his best to mention it may well be just an isolated incident as he felt the majority of the cottagers and other watercrafters that went by were very nice."
345745,tonyb,2009-05-28 14:48:00,1637,"Good post Rick, it is a fairly serious offense if someone is interfering with legal fishing activities.  Further, never hesitate to call the Police at any point when someone is threatening you on the water or anywhere for that matter.  Police have been known to taze or shoot aggresors with a knife...those anglers were in that scenario so it isn't something that should be shrugged off or taken lightly.  The way the anglers responded is taking the path of least resistance, and I get that, but unfortunately apathetic responses to these types of situations will only gaurantee their continuance.  Know your rights and stand up for them people...nobody else will do that for you.  Tony"
345752,bigugli,2009-05-28 15:08:00,6138," In Canada this is not just about rights. There are also responsibilities. In Canadian law, the Crown's law, we have an obligation and responsibility to report breaches of the law when they occur.  Otherwise the law, and your rights, are worthless.  You witness an offense, report it. If the authorities don't want to act, then report 'that' to the media."
345755,CLofchik,2009-05-28 15:10:00,854,"I've been hassled in my canoe plenty of times, and I hardly ever keep fish.  I feel ripped off, all those fresh caught fish dinners I missed and I STILL get hassled!  My top three:  1)  Took two days to portage into bass back lake, I'm there half a day before a float plane lands and an hour later two guys motor over to my camp and ask me to leave.  This was after all ""their"" lake that they come to for opener every year and they don't like anyone else on it.  2)  This chucklehead on the Credit that tried to string barbed wire across the river every year, he didn't like all the canoeists in the Spring that paddled through ""His"" stretch of the river.  3)  Every marshmallow soaking numbnut during salmon season that doesn't like lure tossers on ""their"" part of the pier.   Moral of the story, it's more about jerkoff people getting uppity about what they feel is ""theirs"" and think they can bully anybody they want if they just yell loud enough, this pretty much transcends racial barriers and always has."
345780,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-28 16:09:00,10439,  Well said Rick. It doesn't matter what race any of the people involved were. It was against the law and they should be held accountable. And maybe a talking to from the cops will inform them that this behaviour is unacceptable and won't be tollerated.
345783,BillM,2009-05-28 16:19:00,17367,  I really hoped you chuckled at them and didn't leave.
