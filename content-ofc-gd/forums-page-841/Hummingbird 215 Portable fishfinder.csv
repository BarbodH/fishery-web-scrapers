238930,holdfast,2008-08-12 04:56:00,1813,Just bought a portable figuring on using it for the canoe or small boat.  Any problems and anything I should know when setting it up.  Any and all advice will help as I'm no pro with fish-finders.  Thanks

So now I try adjusting the transducer with the narrow point almost facing upward to the transom, but get readings of fish at 80' to 90' and the depth is at 200'..... So i decide to go back and adjust the transducer as it says in the manual, structure and bottom contours come up fine but still no Fish, and yet I'm catching them one after another below the boat.  PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE HEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLP !!!!!!!!"

346136,gone_fishin,2009-05-29 16:45:00,481,"i never see any ""fish"" on that unit, i use it strictly for depth, weed growth, structure, etc... i have the fish ID turned off also. find the depth and structure that you want and fish it, let your lure be the ""fish finder""  it's a cheapo fish finder, you can't really expect much more than depth and weed growth... unless you're ice fishing, then set it up with the fish alarm turned OFF and you'll be able to see the fish coming through."
