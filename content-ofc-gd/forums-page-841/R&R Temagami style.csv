345264,johnnyb,2009-05-27 01:47:00,3413,"Last Tuesday, my cousin (Bicephalic on the board) and I headed up north for a long anticipated trip to the Temagami area. The idea was to tow the canoe behind the tinboat, so that we could fish our main destination lake in comfort, while dragging the canoe into one or two back lakes. Ultimately, we did a pretty darn good job of sticking to the plan, even though we ended up bailing out on a couple of back lakes.  What we also did was learn a lot about early season pike, backwoods trails, and the finicky nature of brook trout. Words can't really do it justice, so here are the straight facts and pics: Lakers were in the 18-22 inch range, extremely spunky, hitting consistently in the top 15 FOW.  They had a very clear preference for long slender minnow baits in the Mercer's Magic pattern...and didn't mind hitting a nice gold Panther Martin #20 every now and then.  Most had nymphs in their bellies...stone or mayfly, I assume.     Pike fishing was pretty cool, once we found a nice, shallow, WARM bay on the north end of the lake.  I've never seen pike get spooked by the boat, but, we learned quickly to get their attention on the lure before they saw us...got my PB at 37 inches   We moved lakes altogether for the last two days, where we couldn't locate any similar water, but, my cousin and his Mercer's Magic found the pike in typical coves/points out of the wind, bordering on deep water...nailed HIS PB with a very fat 27.5 incher that we had to weigh for curiousity's sake...came in at just under 4.5lbs.  Not too shabby.      As for the backlakes...some helpful hints from fellow OFC'rs had us focusing on one lake in particular, even though the original plan was to hit two.  Poor access and poor reviews kept us on a track to one lake in particular, which was nice, but, apparently so secret that not even the brookies knew about it!   Still impressive getting back in there...and most notably, we had a cell phone signal, which allowed me to get a VERY important message from Laker Jessy at home, who was at the 19 week ultrasound   All in all, we fished from morning till night, ate trout and pike for breakfast and dinner, and came home feeling like we had been living in another world for a week.  What more could we ask for    If you're still reading...here's some scenery pics to send you on your way..tight lines!      "
