I've spent too much time today (boss is gonna start wondering) trying to figure out where I can do it that won't cost me any money for a full day (6am til evening).  I know a great spot thats free on weekends and right off the 401 (easy off and back on) but its $20 workdays  - at that rate we could take both cars out to the lake so there's gotta be something better - anyone have any ideas?"
