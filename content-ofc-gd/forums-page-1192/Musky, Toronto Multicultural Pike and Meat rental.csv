86720,snag,2007-06-22 15:39:00,1932,"Had my best Musky fishing day on Scugog. I had a few hours in the morning on my way back from business in the area. Love my inflatable kayak.  The crapper is that my camera died but I did get one water shot.  Caught 3 'ski's from 34""-38"" and had a slowwwwwww follow from a very brave 45"" approx. It's gills were flaring, mouth opening. I figure 8'd but no deal closer. My legs dangling in the water may have spooked it!?   The action was fantastic from 8:30-11am. I stopped around 1pm. Nobody around and I split due to wind pick-up Loads of bass too.  Oh ya, DEAD CARP EVERYWHERE! No exaggeration. It stank. I only saw one living carp (barely). Really wonder if it will spread elsewhere..........  I had all my other Musky lures with new and sharpened hooks ready to go, but the weed situation was too much for them. Any lure with more than 1 treble were just raking weeds.  Yes, that's Clives (Mepps) homemade spinner again!   WHAT FIGHTERS!!! I FORGOT WHY THEY ARE SOOO ADDICTIVE! With the inflatable kayak, your heart is coming out of your mouth.   Back to Toronto  Went out for lunch. This was a very weird fish to see in the darker water. It literally looked half white and half black! Dollarama slama      Is it just me that see's this??   The fishing is hot right now! Happy bassin' y'all! "
86721,mattyk,2007-06-22 15:41:00,2110,nice report. I dont want to rent any meat.
86723,Fishnfiend,2007-06-22 15:55:00,357,"That second musky is on a dollarama lure?  They have improved their selection this year... They even carry wire leaders, etc now.  I am not sure that I'd attach anything but a dollarama lure to one of their wire leaders though."
86724,highdrifter,2007-06-22 15:55:00,2534,Well done Snagster!  I wish to join your little kayak fishing fleet.  Where can I sign up?!!  I am not worthy of your greatness...  But I wish to bask in your fishing prowess.  WUUUUT  Fiddlon
86727,snag,2007-06-22 16:07:00,1932," Actually, the musky was on the Mepps spinner. The Rapala rip-off might be strong enough (change the hooks) but I wouldn't risk that.  It seems that different Dollaramas have varied selection."
86728,snag,2007-06-22 16:09:00,1932,  You shut up.  You will be converted.  Toober Goober.
86730,bassmaster4,2007-06-22 16:20:00,801,great report and the rent meat truck is hillarious lol
86731,tbayboy,2007-06-22 16:23:00,1497,"Mmmmm rented meat mmmm.  Great pics but damn, dangling legs in the water while bringing a muskie in - I'm assuming there some 'getting out of the way' mode for when the thrash at the side with a bunch of dangling hooks around"
86744,wolfville,2007-06-22 16:54:00,396,"Do you have to return those rented meat in the original condition or it can be returned ""processed""?  Nice report. Fishing from a small craft is always fun, especially when you are chasing the big girls."
86765,addict,2007-06-22 18:04:00,475,nice pics.looks like i should try the old scumbog for a few toothy critters.but i think ill wait till the gulls and buzzards clean up those stanky carp.
86801,mepps,2007-06-22 21:27:00,1301,nicely done! My Scugog spinners never fail!
86871,jediangler,2007-06-23 13:03:00,1923,Nice work. I don't know about the inflatable kayak and treble hooks though. I think I'd be more likely to rent meat.
86873,dsn,2007-06-23 13:44:00,1018,Hmmm tangling your feet in the water to attract a muskie then get him to take your lure as he gets in closer. Who would have thought?  But it worked!!  Always bring and extra set of batteries. I always carry 4 sets with me all charged up.  Nice fish!!  dsn
86949,Mike the Pike,2007-06-24 00:39:00,3421,Way to go another report with Dollarama magic.Snag thanks for the pics.Man I have to catch a Muskie.  WTG   MTP
87074,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-24 15:49:00,0,And here I am wasting all my money on expensive lures. Good Job!!!
87416,snag,2007-06-25 15:34:00,1932,Yup  Remember when I casted your lure into the tree! Glad it made it back.  I panic when the fish goes for a run under the 'Yak. I also plan to walk/swim to show just in case.......  Exacctly!
87489,TJQ,2007-06-25 17:50:00,7806,Nice pics.... ummm Ive rented meat before...  lol
87630,snag,2007-06-25 21:15:00,1932, Does that mean I have/should expect a PM?
87631,Bernie,2007-06-25 21:17:00,3190,"Love to read your reports Snag, always good for a chuckle and usually some good fish."
87636,ccmtcanada,2007-06-25 21:35:00,7971,Way to go Snag!!!  Wow...I have yet to find muskie on Scugog!  Dollarama comes thru yet again for you.  Looked like a great day of fishing!  Oh yeah...I know where those masts are...but the secret is safe with me...haha.
87728,[emailÂ protected],2007-06-26 00:19:00,25,"Dude, nice big game in a kayak.  I just went out for the first time in my new kayak...this is just the beginning!"
