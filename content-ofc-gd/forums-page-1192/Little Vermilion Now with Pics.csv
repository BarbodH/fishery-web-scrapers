87242,hogsmally,2007-06-25 04:45:00,21,"Following in Connie and Clive's footsteps, my dad and I fished Little V June 16-23.  The wind and cold front that came through really made for a tough bite for us, but we managed 5 Pike over 40 inches for the week, the largest at just over 43"".  All of our fish came on large spinnerbaits fished on deep reed edges with emerging cabbage on the outside edge.  We had some really tough days, managing only a handful of pike.  It seems that the extremely inconsistent weather the area has had has created for some tougher fishing and a lack of good weedbeds, resulting in scattered fish as they move toward summer haunts. Pike also seemed thin compared to pictures of other fish I have seen from this lake, probably also a result of the rain and inconsistent weather.  I think earlier in the year may have provided us with some more consistent fishing with the way the fish were in transition during this week.  We saw the best action of 40"" inchers out of all the guests in camp this week, and the largest for the week for the entire camp was around 44"".  I have fished better numbers lakes in Ontario for sure, with a  higher number of 30""-35"" fish,  but the obvious trophy potential is a reality.  Pictures and more details will follow, but it was a fun trip and I would like to thank all of those, especially Connie, for your advice and help with planning the trip and fishing.  I will be back to this lake at some point.  Lumberjack     Pics: Awaiting the trip   Tell the pilot to watch where is going!   My Dad and I have arrived   A couple decent fish      More to follow"

87363,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-25 14:28:00,957,"44, glad to help.  PM me anytime.  I have no secrets.  Fish were in transition from the opening bell as they could be found almost all over the lake.  The only pattern was that there was not a specific pattern.  Thanks for your report."
87673,hogsmally,2007-06-25 22:48:00,21,"More Pics of the pike we caught-        Thanks again TNGuy  We found fish, but at least 3 of the days were almost unfishable due to high winds.  All of the fish you see were caught in a 3 and a half day span.  I saw some giants that I did not catch."
87683,Smokey,2007-06-25 23:14:00,1278,Thanks for the report. You had some great looking fish there all looking healthy. I can't imagine the size some of them will grow to by the fall.  Thanks for posting the pics.
87696,arthur,2007-06-25 23:36:00,11,"Thanks for the report. We were there the week before and had similar results, though the winds weren't that bad for us.  Glad to see you guys got some quality fish."
