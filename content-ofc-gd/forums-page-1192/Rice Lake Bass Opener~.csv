86947,Steelcat,2007-06-24 00:35:00,191,"Weather was sunny and cold.  The wind was blowing from N to NW pretty strong.  With a cold weather for the past couple of days, we knew that today will be a slow day.  We arrived at Bewdley at 6:15am, we blasted off at around 6:30.  To our surprise, there weren't too many boats out on the lake.  We started to fish immediately using senko as well as spinnerbait.  We drift all over the area until 9am, NO bite~!  Then we switch to our other location this time we mainly use senko and jig/grub.  At around 11am, we managed to catch a Sunfish.  After 30 more minutes of drifting, we finally got our first 2007 open season bass.  It was a nice 17 inches Largemouth.  After that one, they suddenly started to bite.  One after an other total we caught around 18 bass, one nice 17 inches Smallmouth.  We also managed to catch 2 Crappie around 10 inches, as well as a lovely Rock Bass.  After 2:30pm, the bite stopped again so we called it a day.  Overall, it was a nice opener except for the slow bite.  Our first fish of the day  First opener Largemouth~!  Here's one of the two Crappie.  A nice size Smallmouth.  Lovely Rock Bass  Several more Largemouth to call it a day    One of the Largemouth was gorged on baby bullhead, seems like this bass found the nest and ""babysit"" all of them.  Here's one of them >< "

87005,Steelcat,2007-06-24 08:58:00,191,"I left plenty of bass for you to enjoy   For me, yesterday slow presentation works for me.  Maybe the situation will be changed today.  If you are fishing with a buddy, one of you should stick on slow presentation and the other go for spinner or other fast presentation  Good luck today"
