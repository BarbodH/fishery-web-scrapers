87207,scuro,2007-06-25 02:32:00,386,Yeah floating bread. A old gentlemen was feeding carp directly by tossing bread to them at our park. I asked him if I could use a piece and simply put on a small hook. Worked about 3 times before they all got wise. Unfortantly they didn't return...Doh!!! Talk about topwater.

I'd like to do that sometimes, hauling 100 lb of equipment isn't fun, and once settled it's very hard to make me move even if the fishing is slow. Your way of stalking carp is very mobile.  Thanks for sharing... good to see people enjoy the sport in many different ways."
