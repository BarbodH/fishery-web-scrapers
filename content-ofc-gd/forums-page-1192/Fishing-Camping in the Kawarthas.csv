Anyone know of any good spots to camp overnight, that are also close to a boat rental place in the Kawartha Lakes?  I'd also like to try a new lake there, so if anyone has some favorites let me know. So far I've tried Stoney, Clear, Lower Buckhorn, and Burleigh Falls. Also I promise to put together a fishing report this next time, havent had the time to report on my previous trip (but to summarize I set a personal record with about 14 bass in under 2 hours starting around 7am. I imagine an earlier start would produce even better."

There are tons of campsites on the lake, as well as boat rental locations.  If you want both in one location, check out Golden Beach Resort.  Hope this helps."
