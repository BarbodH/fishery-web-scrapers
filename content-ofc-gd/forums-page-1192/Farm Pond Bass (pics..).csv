The neighbor behind us has a pond and allows us to fish it anytime...so tonight me and the boys went back.  Caught this on a silver worm....Evan took the pic and Joah is looking on:   Here's Evan (that slide in the back is up near our house):   I was fishing there last night and caught 3...no pics, so I don't want to talk alot, but I'm going back to catch that one I know was over 6lbs.......  I love being back in the country!"
