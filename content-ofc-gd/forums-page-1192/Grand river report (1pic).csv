The river is at late summer low levels and we scratched our boat bottoms in several sections of the river. The most productive stretches of river were behind the Lanc Hotel and behind the Humane Society. I ended up with 11 smallies none bigger than 12"", all were hooked on a 1/16oz jig & grub combo.. The Shipper caught 6 smallies, all on a bitsy bug with a double tailed bungee grub. His biggest was this 16"" smallie.  We pulled out at the Freeport bridge at 4pm. It was a long hot ride down the ole Grand, but enjoyable none the less."

87432,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-25 16:02:00,0,Smallies are always a fiesty catch. I didnt know the grand got that shallow.
87608,jediangler,2007-06-25 20:16:00,1923,"The Grand gets as shallow as 6"" in some spots we travelled. The most productive depths were between 3-5' with rocky bottom. We don't usually have to worry about shallow water till the end of August. The fact that it is so dry already makes me wonder how deep it will be in August. We need some rain in a bad way."
