87105,sonny,2007-06-24 20:05:00,511,"ok ,,just a little two day report,,,headed out on saturday morning to lake erie for a day of fishing,,met up with jen and my nefew and took them out to see if we could catch a few bass...nothing happening so decided to troll for  a bit before bringing them back at noon,,,,still nothing.. By this time the wind had picked up so decided to fish the grand river for some walleye,,,ended up catching one walleye,,,part of the reason for only catching one is i couldn't keep the sheephead off my lures, must have caught 30-40 of them,ohh ya and snagged one carp,,,THEN,,,just as i thought i snagged anouther carp i pull in this little beauty http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s55/son...46/Image042.jpg  Anouther one for team 5!!!   a 32 inch channel cat that took a small rapalla...pretty cool  Anyway sunday morning comes along and four of us from work head out for a day of sunshine and fishing on lake ontario,,,we did ok boating four fish each boat and having a bunch of knock-offs  here's a few pic's from the day..ohh ya the guy that i took out has nnever caught a fish up untill today,,,was pretty neet being able to bust his fish-virginity,,lol http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s55/son...46/Image044.jpg http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s55/son...46/Image045.jpg http://i149.photobucket.com/albums/s55/son...46/Image047.jpg"
87120,PERCHER,2007-06-24 21:36:00,787,Way to go there Sonny.At least you didnt get skunked.I have always wanted to try Erie for bass or walleye.But have never had a guide to show me the way.Dan
87145,sonny,2007-06-25 00:02:00,511,"hey percher,,,anytime,,,the walleye should start soon!!...and the bass ..well there easy!!,,,we may not catch em but we'll have fun tryin!!"
87243,Jen,2007-06-25 04:47:00,833,"So those bass are easy Eh SONNY??? Go figure, all the easy ones must have had a night out on the town Friday and that is why we were not catching them Saturday morning.  Great report, thanks for the morning on your Boat, Zachary will never forget it... specially the fact that you let him drive and talk the entire time.  We both know how you like peace and quiet in your boat.  Nice Cat... sorry we missed it..  Can't wait to do it again.. Will post a pic or two of you and my little guy from Saturday when I find what I did with my camera...  Cheers,  Jen"
