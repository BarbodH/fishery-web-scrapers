86893,Gerritt,2007-06-23 16:20:00,6129,Just got in from a week @ the West Arm.... I met up with all the guys @ Lakair...(My report will be ready sometime this weekend as I need to unload the boat and truck still) I also had the pleasure of taking Cliff and Carole out in my boat for a couple of hours of fishing... The fishing was tough however... we had a massive coldfront (see pics) moved in the night before and the winds were harsh and cold.. I knew the Walleye would be a tough catch so I figured lets try something else.....   I moved and moved and moved to spots I know produce and have done well at in the past.. Until.........   Well I will Let Cliff tell you what happened...  Lets just say the boys and ladies are having a great time! I bet they were a little frostbitten this morning though!   Gerritt.
