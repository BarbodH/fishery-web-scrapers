You have to take a a train ride to get up there...  They have been a great client of mine over the years and are in the process (after this season) of selling the lodge cottages off individually.  Have a look at this!!  Great Fishing, remote... perfect for OFNers!!  http://www.cottageontario.com/sonnybob.pdf"
87394,fishindevil,2007-06-25 14:55:00,6254,"Well lets all put our money in,and all of us members can buy the place and we all have a great place to go and fish forever...wow...i sure wish TJ  thanks for sharing that...sure looks like a great piece of heaven thats for sure...cheers"
87400,Terry,2007-06-25 15:01:00,14456,"I don't see how he is selling the individual cabins, it looks hard to divide into lots and some will not have lakefront, so they could end up with no access...........but I am sure he thought of that and figured out a way........ yeah we should all buy it...LOL"
87401,SlowPoke,2007-06-25 15:02:00,2984,"Hmmm how 'bout an OFC Timeshare? If Feb 2-8 open is still open, count me in!"
87411,OhioFisherman,2007-06-25 15:31:00,6623,The lake is only 43 feet deep? Does it freeze solid in the winter?
87466,pigeonfisher,2007-06-25 17:13:00,696,Seems expensive to me...
87469,TJQ,2007-06-25 17:19:00,7806, Actually for good fishing .. i think its prettty reasonable.  I would think its a great place to have if you have the time to spend there!
87567,aplumma,2007-06-25 19:37:00,6896,Looks like a nice place to kick back and rest for a little while. It is a shame it is not closer to Virginia......   Art
87575,misfish,2007-06-25 19:43:00,29133,"You buy it boss,and I,ll take care of it for ya."
87676,Gerritt,2007-06-25 23:00:00,6129,"Sounds like he may be doing what Samoset (Beside Lakair)  is doing.... Selling you the cottage but NOT the LAND! you then pay yearly fees for upkeep and maintenance  etc I say that because there are no lot size descriptions, he therefor holds the title to the property.  Gerritt."
