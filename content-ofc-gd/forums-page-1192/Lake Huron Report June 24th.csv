Only four boats doing they Canadian Drift and we were all catching fish in 40 to 60 FOW. Would have fished longer, but I snapped a new rod on a hookset and packed it in.  Great Day on the Water (expect for the 40' Carver that didn't care about ""right of way"" and nearly swamped as with a 15' swell under the Bluewater bridge  ) "
