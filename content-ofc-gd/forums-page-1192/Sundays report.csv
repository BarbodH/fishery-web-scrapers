Since my son and I are going to be fishing a tourney on Sparrow in a few weeks,we thought we would see what was what.We decide to hit buckets first,he likes the buckets.We hit a nice filled weed bay and it wasnt long before we were into fish. A nice 4 lb chunk followed by another 3+. Ok we like what we seen, so off we go to another bay. Again it didnt take long to get into them again, but smaller fish 2+ pounders,still nice though.James for some reason didnt catch on,well ,he was getting pike,I explained to him they dont count.LOL  We check out some other areas that you wouldnt expect to get them and it turned out to be places where we didnt get them.HAHAHA.  We drift the last bay of the day and James gets into them and my son nails another 3+ chunk.I miss a solid smack on a jig and chunk.To slow on the reflex.LOL   Someone here asked me to give an honest opinion on the wizzle worms and tubes after I had used them. All I can say is,all fish caught both Saturday and Sunday,except for what James caught,were all on Wizzles worms and tubes,and the fish hammered them.. We used them weedless and they produced."

I love going fishing with my dad still. cant wait to have a son, to take fishing as well!   There is a tourny on Sparrow? What date, who is running it? I might be interested in doing that one as well."
