Long time neighbor and former partner in tournaments, a freaking poacher, with the typical poacher`s logic.  Saw my former friend`s truck hood open and stopped to see if he needed a hand, no just adding a little oil. Started talking about other things, dude I got pheasant in my yard, ya me too! Shot one and ate it yesterday, say what? with a rifle? out of season? it`s my yard! if I didn`t shoot it dogs and cats would have killed it or someone else would have shot it!  Never saw that coming from that sportsman, lost all respect. Just another poacher!"
