87208,DMASSE,2007-06-25 02:33:00,420,"Hello  Went to a area sniper rifle competition shoot,  and brought out the bad boys of sniper rifles.  Here is the one of my favorite sniper rifles to shoot  A HS-.50 from Steyr-Mannlicher AG  This gun is made to shoot a min 500 yrds  and levels out at 2 miles        One thing you have to think of is that this gun is 4 ft long and weights 35 pounds,  the muzzle break is 7in wide and shoots about a 2 ft flame out then when shot.  The second guy is another STEYR sniper rifle in a 308 cal..    grouping with this gun is 1-2 in at 300yrds  The next gun is very cool to have,  its a AR15 Custom 308..     Also we shot S&W 1911's  and Glocks 22 9mm,  as well as some black powder  All in all a fun competition and a very sore arm LOL  hope you enjoyed  Dave"

87223,Sinker,2007-06-25 03:25:00,8692,"Good stuff! Any pics of  your targets?  I took my 5 y/o son out on saturday for his first shots ever. He had a couple shots out of the .410 at the trap range, and a bunch of shots out of the .22. He LOVED it!! I think I'll be looking into a .410 just for him now....  Sinker"
87245,Photoz,2007-06-25 08:28:00,792,"A tad more firepower than the ol' single-shot .22 Cooey I used to have . . . . .    ?? I'm rather surprised that the .50 calibre cannon was allowed to be brought in, even for a competition. I saw a segment of '60 Minutes' a while back, on these guns . . . .     not exactly an ideal hunting rifle . . . .     unless you're after elephants or rhinos!! (Or PEOPLE?) I don't think I'd like to be trying an off-hand shot with it . . . . .     I suspect I'd be sitting on my butt, about 6' from where I started. Just for curiousity . . . .   what would the muzzle velocity of a huge bullet (about 500 grain??) like that be?"
87252,Terry,2007-06-25 10:28:00,14456,ah nothing like a 50 cal  you shoot him in the hand and it rips his whole arm off..    and no they are not made for hunting..just target shooting.... takes lots of skill
87254,misfish,2007-06-25 10:37:00,29133,Nice toys.
87255,motv8tr,2007-06-25 10:43:00,2587,"Oh sure, talk about the competition, show us pictures of you shooting, but don't tell us how it went????  What a tease  Maureen"
87267,DMASSE,2007-06-25 11:45:00,420,"PHOTOZ  He in Canada there is a 50cal club,  and they usually shoot matchs every month.. In .50BMG calibre, the muzzle energy can be in excess of 10,000 ft/lbs depending on the loading, with a muzzle velocity usually just under 3000 ft/sec.  With the ammo costing around $9.00 a shot,  you with the recoil of the gun you tend not to shoot very much.  When you shoot this rifle at 500yrds the hole on the entry is about 2 inchs buit if it would hit comcrete, it would travel 19 inches deep.  The shoot was a industry outing, so no score or points gained  Dave"
