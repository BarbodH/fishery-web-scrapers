86501,misfish,2007-06-21 22:01:00,29133,Yes VERY DIFFERENT.
86504,Roy,2007-06-21 22:09:00,13728,I'm looking forward to trying the Ko-Man-Chi baits though. I haven't bought any yet but I will.
86530,darsky,2007-06-21 23:49:00,586,you may be one Misfish but many others I know will not throw anything else if a check is at stake.
86542,Roy,2007-06-22 00:12:00,13728,"Darren, maybe I didn't understand your post right but  I know that Brian won't back a product that is less than exceptional."
86547,drufis,2007-06-22 00:35:00,45,Stoty  The BPS sale on Senko's goes untill July 8th.  Buy 2 packs get one free. They also have a coupon in the back of the flyer spend $50 and get $5 off.  You know if you go to the BPS store you are not going to come out with only the Senko's LOL...  So bring in $50 and leave the rest of your cards and wallet in the car LOL....  Cheers
86570,darsky,2007-06-22 01:13:00,586,"ok-what I mean is the Dingers/BPS sticks and others all work and will catch fish,but many guides and pros claim that the action and quality of the Senko cannot be beat and will only throw them and not something similar.I am definately NOT knocking Senko-types as my tackle includes dingers & BPS & Komanchi's as well. BTW-KOMANCHI has large grubs that make great trailers for pike/muskie spinnerbaits-wish they had them in white tho'"
86584,fishindevil,2007-06-22 01:39:00,6254,"YES im going to be using my  KO-MAN-CHI tournament baits for sure all different kinds of worms & senkos,sticks/wizzles worms/grubs & tubes....man i have got so many different baits from my sponsor its gonna be hard to decide what to start with....cant wait till 5:00am sat morn....oh ya  cheers"
86588,LesCulpJr,2007-06-22 01:49:00,75,"Like another fella on the thread here, I pour my own and it is definately turning out to be an addiction!  The best I've used though are the strike king zero's  in the 3X series plastic. You can literaly fish all day with one bait. They are pricey and come in at only 5 baits per pkg, but will last you a long time."
86604,Stoty,2007-06-22 02:42:00,2910,I see that a lot of people are sponsored by KO-MAN-CHI tournament baits. How does one go about getting sponsored?
86637,misfish,2007-06-22 10:57:00,29133,"Hi ya Les  Les makes a great bait aswell. Another senko in the mix. There are many brands out there. It,s what ever works for you.   One more sleep."
86657,Zib,2007-06-22 12:40:00,369, BPS sells Senko knock-offs that work just as good as the Senko. They are about half the price & you get 20 in a pack. I've bought some that even had some hooks in the package.
86692,Stoty,2007-06-22 14:29:00,2910,"Perfect, I will be heading to BPS a week from today. For sure have to pick some of those up!"
86703,spanky,2007-06-22 14:51:00,195,stoty- your package should be in the mail... right now lol.... should be there monday i think
86805,mikeymikey,2007-06-22 21:59:00,376," Yup Strike King Zero 3X last forever, it is the softest plastic bait, it stretch so much yet very tough that it won't snap and break.  Sure what you get for what you pay is little high but it is difinitely one to atleast try once."
86823,Stoty,2007-06-23 00:30:00,2910,"So many options to choose from!!!!!!!!! I might need to give my wife some notice that next Friday when I go to BPS, NOT to wait up! I might be there a while!!  ha ha ha"
87302,evster,2007-06-25 12:56:00,367,"After reading this thread I thought I might as well get a pack of senko's in case I got out at all this weekend.  I didn't get out for much fishing but I was down at my parent's boat in Turkey Point Marina.  I usually kill time by fishing off their dock and the odd time I get lucky with a little quarter pounder largemouth, but most of the time i'm just watching the sunfish.  Anyway, i woke up early so i threw a senko on.  A couple casts in I hooked into a good largemouth, about 2 - 2 1/2 pounds.  A bit of a suprise to see it pulling its way under other boats.  Anyway, after about 30 minutes I caught 2 about 2 pounds and three sub pounders.  But all from standing in the same spot, so they either attract lots of fish or the same fish can't resist.  But all in all it made a good impression."
87309,Stoty,2007-06-25 13:10:00,2910,"Right on!  Those baits sure do have a unique action. I caught a nice bass on the weekend after it missed my Chug Bug, on a Senko-type bait.  They are definitely going to be rigged up on a rod at all times with me, from now on!"
86340,Stoty,2007-06-21 14:00:00,2910,"I was reading the ""What is the 1st lure you are going to throw"" thread, and everyone seems to be talking about these Gary Yamamoto Senko's.  Just what are these, and why are they so popular right now?  What makes them different from the other soft plastic worms/slug-go's out there?  Fill me in, because I am obviously out of the loop!"
86343,Victor,2007-06-21 14:07:00,1609,"i have never used them for LM neither ... but judging from your avatar pic, i don't think you need them lol  great topic! i'm looking forward to the replies too ..."
86344,misfish,2007-06-21 14:07:00,29133,"Your holding a brute like that and you didnt catch it on a senko. LOL  plastic stick bait. There are many names out there for it.Senko we call it wizzle worm at komanchi. LOL  You can rig it many ways. Texas,carolina, wacky."
86346,tbayboy,2007-06-21 14:09:00,1497,Article about them and how to fish them by the man himself:  How I Fish the Senko - by Gary Yamamoto
86348,Stoty,2007-06-21 14:12:00,2910,"hahha, thanks. I have a couple good patterns down for catching some nice LM, but am curious about these Senko's though.  what makes these so special? how are they different from the other stick baits on the market?"
86350,spanky,2007-06-21 14:14:00,195,"been around for a few years now, really popular everywhere it seems... it's a salted stick bait that you pretty much dead stick, as it falls the ends wiggle a bit... works really well when the bite is slow... so many different names, GY senko is the original... then you got yum dingers, tiki sticks, wizzle worms, etc...  The originals are pricey at $10. for a pack (of 8 ithink?), haven't bought any in a couple years, much more reqarding pouring my own and catching them!! lol"
86356,Stoty,2007-06-21 14:26:00,2910,"ahh, i see.  $10 for 8, yikes! maybe I will look for the alternates...... geesh.  how do you go about pouring your own? where can I pick up equipment like that?"
86363,spanky,2007-06-21 14:36:00,195,"imo.... the only thing that beats the originals are the handpours... tho some do swear by the Yum dingers!!  www.tackleunderground.com will get you started... www.del-mart.com is one of the suppliers, you'll find the rest on the tacklunderground website... be warned tho, if you choose to start pouring you will become addicted lol  If you lived closer i'd make you up a couple packs for free to try out... sadly, the shipping charges are ridiculous and it would be cheaper to just buy them at a tackle shop instead... handpourers have the advantage of creating their own colours tho... think taht's where the addiction comes in lol"
86367,Stoty,2007-06-21 14:44:00,2910,"Thanks very much for the offer! How much would shipping be from Niagara, to Pickering?? I wouldnt think it would be that much, considering its only 2 hrs apart. I would be willing to pay for the baits, as long as they aren't $10/bag!! hahaha"
86376,Golfisher,2007-06-21 15:09:00,586,"BPS had them on sale yesterday.  Buy two bags, get another for free."
86379,Stoty,2007-06-21 15:11:00,2910,Ahhh! How long is that sale on for?
86382,Golfisher,2007-06-21 15:20:00,586,No idea how long the sale will last.  Give them a call and find out: 905-761-4000.
86384,Terry,2007-06-21 15:32:00,14456,"senko is now used as the generic name for that type of bait...so many people say they caught it on a senko or to use a senko, but they may be using a wizzle worm or others"
86385,Stoty,2007-06-21 15:36:00,2910,right on.  thanks for everyone that replied. going to have to give these baits a try!
86388,wask,2007-06-21 15:45:00,174,"I have been fishing them for ten years now, I got my boat (that I don't have any more) from one of yamamatos pros in Georgia.  he gave me a couple of packs of them when I picked up the boat.  I haven't had as much success with anything else.  They catch fish in any situation it seems.  Crazy.  The attraction is not only the wiggle as they fall, which is really cool, but it is also the fact that they fall horizontally instead of vertically.  Some other baits do this, but the senko type baits all fall the best this way.  I find the ones that aren't real senkos to be good though.  I have been fishing tiki sticks with the same success as senkos for the last year.  I buy them for 2.88/ per package at walmart in the US.  I do keep a couple packs of the original around too though and fish with them too, just sparingly.  The original Yamamatos are sort of fragile I find though, one or two fish and they are done.  The other brands are a lot tougher and seem to catch more fish before you have to change the bait because it is destroyed.  They are a great bait and very versitile.  Once you try them, you'll always have them handy...  Good luck!"
86396,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-21 16:35:00,4399,"I love them discovered them a couple years ago and it is my favorite bait,BPS had a sale on last year I think for Konami Baits same as a Senko I bought about 30 bags I didn`t dare tell the wife I spent 160 bucks plus tax on plastic worms LOL she might question my sanity.  They are very dense and this creates a slow fall almost always the bass will take it on the fall and hold on to it tight the only draw back of the Senko is it`s durability they tend to tear up after a few fish."
86397,Mattitude,2007-06-21 16:35:00,155,"I love Senkos, they work so well.  The only downfall to them is that they don't last too long.  One good shake and they'll tear off the hook.    "
86401,misfish,2007-06-21 16:51:00,29133,"Use the ring Matt,It does prolong the leaving of the hook.LOL   Dang tirty bucks for dat  Hey matt if yer around Saturday,I,ll be at the park around noon with a few of the other fellas from here.Big Brothers big sisters event.Stop by say howdy."
86413,Mattitude,2007-06-21 17:08:00,155,I gotta work until 3:00 am friday night but I will definetly try to get down to say hi.
86418,Dutch,2007-06-21 17:21:00,831,"I use Yum Dingers - same action as a senko, but more durable.  I usually stick a small finishing nail in them to alter the fall speed.  Sometimes a toothpick to make more bouyant.  If you stick a finishing nail in the tail, at the other end away from the hook, they will sink away from the cast.  Great for getting in under docks and such - Who needs a flying lure?"
86419,Stoty,2007-06-21 17:24:00,2910,"ohhh, good idea! OK, thats it, I am going to have to give these things a try!  Gonna pick up a bag tonight after work!"
86477,darsky,2007-06-21 20:35:00,586,funny-the pros and tourney anglers know all about the cheaper clones and knock offs but they will always use the senko no matter what.Tells me something.
86483,misfish,2007-06-21 20:53:00,29133, You lost me there darsky? I have used the stick bait from alot of different manufactures.
86484,Hookset,2007-06-21 20:56:00,367,"Back before they were well known as Senko's, they were usually referred to as Sluggo's. I'm pretty sure the Sluggo brand was the first mass produced soft plastic jerkbait in true stick bait form. Berkley then came out with their copy called the Power Slug. These outfished the Sluggo brand by far. Why Berkley stopped producing them I don't know. My friends and I have only rarely found them in packs of 100 and we always scoop them up. If anyone has, or knows the whereabouts of, Power Slugs in black or red/black please let me know. They only work on the lakes I fish though so they won't be any good to you anyway.   Hookset."
86487,wask,2007-06-21 21:21:00,174,"I find the senkos and the slug-gos are actually very different baits.  The principal is the same as far as being a stick bait, but they are very different.    "
