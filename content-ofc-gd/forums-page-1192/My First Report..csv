86987,Andrew,2007-06-24 03:32:00,54,"I decide to go to Brant Conservation Area for the day to fish the mighty Grand River.  I arrived about 10am and the damn was absolutely packed with people -- not a problem since I had every intention of fishing upstream anyway.  However on a side note, they have signs there that say you can not fish within 22.9 metres of an obstruction (damn)  I was amazed at the number of people that were fishing right at the damn with no regard for that rule.  Unless I am misinterpreting it?  Anyways, I walked up stream stopping now and then to fish a hole, I wasn't having a whole lot of success for the first couple of hours, but finally i managed to catch something!  I caught about 50 feet of line, with a hook and a still moving worm on the end of it.  THere was no one in sight but I'm guessing the people must have just left before I got there.  I stuck a piece of the worm on my tube (I had no live bait with me) and within a couple casts I had my first smallie on  he was putting up a decent fight with a couple nice jumps, but on the third jump he spit the hook and that was the end of that.  I switched over to a mepps aglia #3 and on my first cast BANG fish on!  Managed to land him, nothing large maybe a pound and a half max.  In the next hour I managed 2 more about the same size, I could see a lot of fish swimming up to maybe take a strike at it, but I guess at the last second they changed their mind because they would miss it completely and not return -- I saw one monster bass do this.  All in all it was definitely a great day for fishing, it was a bit cooler so the tempature was definately bearable, probably couldn't have gotten better weather for the day!  It wasn't until I got home that I noticed I brought a friend with me.  This has kinda freaked me out a little bit.  I had a tick latched on to my stomach, shirt was on the entire day so somehow it managed to get up there, and they definately don't come off easy.  Needed a pair of tweezers to finally get it out.  It wasn't till after I disposed of it that I did some research on the internet, of course the chances of getting anything from this tick is very remote its definately something that has me a little concerned.  Anyways, so long as I survive the tick bite it was a great day to be out fishing!  Brantford has some beautiful stretches of water -- much deeper than what I have seen in the KW Area as well.  It was definately a nice change."
