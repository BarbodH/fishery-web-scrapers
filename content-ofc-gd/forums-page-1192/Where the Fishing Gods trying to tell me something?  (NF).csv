I was almost done the weeding and about to mow the lawn, when i turned around from my kneeling postion and saw a curious looking skunk staring me right in the face (about 2 feet away) for what seemed like an eternity.  It was probably more like 10 sesonds or so, but seem much longer.  I didnt move at first and neither did my new friend.  A loud noise came from the other yard (the neighbour was doing some work on his shed) and the skunk now looked more confused and scared then curious.  It was off in the other direction, like a shot.  I put 2 and 2 together and figured it was roused from his previous home under the neighbours shed.  I went into the house to get the camera and grab a couple of pics.  It eventually ended up going in behind my shed and i havent seen it since.   I might have to call someone to trap it and take it to the woods.      I sure hope this isnt some type of sign from the fishing gods of how things will go for me next weekend.  FOTB "

87043,Carp,2007-06-24 13:49:00,1488,Look at it as a positive sign. The skunk is telling you to get out of there and go fishing.

87182,RobHall,2007-06-25 01:39:00,261," Thanks MTP.  It's good to know, that it's hard to get skunked on the French river.  I'll be posting a detailed report of my entire week, when i get back on the 7th of Jul .  It's looking like a cool, but stable week up there for the entire week.  I hope that report includes a few species of fish and a PB ski.  Cheers,  FOTB "
