86967,pikeie,2007-06-24 01:57:00,380,"so aftger waiting for what seemed forever bass season is finally here!  . Tinbanger, my Bro and my self went out to cooks today to see if we could get a few bass. last year we had a great opener in the bay but this year it sure was differnt. we really had to work for the fish that we caught infact by the end of the day i was the only one who got anybass  . so we get to our first spot, we are fishing some thick reeds in 4-5 feet of water and i get a hit on my 3rd cast, set the hook missed. pitched it back out and hit agian i set the hook and this time i hooked up, wasnt fighting too much so figured it was just a small bass, i get it to the boat and it is an 11 inch rockie lol. i thought it was just a fluke but the whole day went like that. big rockie after big rockie lol some reached more the 12 inches lol. so we moved over to another spot and finally my fish bass of 2007. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...182649310\ first bass all 13 inches of it lol next tinbanger feels some weight, is it a fish? http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1182649835 lol nope haha  so we tryed a few more spots and agian all we got we some rockies, the day isnt looking good.  so we went back to some deeper reeds and grass mats to see if we could pick up and fish, i throm in a wacky riged senko up to the weed line and i finally get a better hit and fish on great! after a great fight i got my first respectable smallie of the year. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1182649630 http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1182649653 a nice smallie 18"" long and over 3 lbs.  a few casts later with a flippin jig and yum chunk i had a solid hit but when i set the hook the smallie comes flying out of the water and shakes the hook free. DANG!  we were watching some of the other guys on the water and there is this one guy pounding the floating islands, he wasnt getting anything so he took off, we went in and first pitch for me tick tick, fish on! a nice largie jumps and trys to spit my jig and trailer but he was hooked good and got him in the boat. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1182650032 this fish was just shy of 19"".  so i wish today had a bit better action but it was all good, it felt great to be fishin for bass agian."
