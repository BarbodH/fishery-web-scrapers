My hat goes off to all the boaters involved and to all the volunteers.Just a super job done by all. And to Mr, David Chong,man I had a super time and thanks for everything today.Totally a class event.  My little guy for the event was Dereck. Smart little guy and what a joy to fish with. I had mention we would take it slow at the start with the speed he told me straight out,LET IT FLY BRIAN. LOL Boy was a real trooper. Even managed a few nice bass for his efforts.2.30 smallie and this nice bucket.      I will be back next year for sure. I also had the privalge of meeting a few OFC members that I didnt even know where members. My boat gave me away.Hey I know you.LOL  Back on the water again Sunday.  Later  Man what a day.   Brandon Im sure will have more photos to add,as he was clicking away all day. BTW dude,Nice fish."
86914,Smokey,2007-06-23 22:47:00,1278,Great work Brian. I'm sure everyone had a great time and theres a few more hooked on fishing becuase you guys.
86929,brandon,2007-06-23 23:44:00,857,Nice to finally meet you Brian.  The kids had a blast out there today and it was a very well run event.  I went early this morning to take pics of the launch and then was planning on just hanging out until the weighin for more pictures but next thing I know Mr. Chong asks if I would like to get on a boat and go take some pics on the water and how could I say no?  Anyways here are some pics of the event....i took 643 in total but these are a few of the keepers and one is of a smallie I got during a photo break.  Hope you enjoy

87018,JFR,2007-06-24 12:24:00,498,Well done my friend.  Hopefully we have another angler/hunter joining the outdoors.  John
87036,charlesn,2007-06-24 13:11:00,551,"Sorry about breakfast Brian...  My subconscious clearly decided I needed beauty sleep (as I'm sure you noticed) more than steak & eggs and a side of peameal...  lol  Very good job by all the volunteers and boaters and organizers.  Was proud to be a part of it and when I explained what was happening to several joggers and park visitors, every one of them gave kudos and I think we helped to elevate the image of bass fishermen just a little at least.  Charles"
