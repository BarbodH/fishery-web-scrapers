Saw a bunch of boats after we launched and headed over. Watched for no more than 5 minute and we saw 5 big whiteys come in. So I got the anchor out and set up the kids and wife and then myself. Within 5 minutes I was into my first ever Whitefish. WOW!!! - like a rock.   Ended up with 4 for 6 in about an hour. Longest was 25"". Could not find my scale so no idea of weight. I got 2 of them and the Mrs. got 2 also. So a first for both of us.    Cleaned and ready for my version of fish crisp tonight - (Take a package of ""Party Mix"" and chop it in the blender)  "
