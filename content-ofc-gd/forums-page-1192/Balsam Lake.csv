87585,Stoty,2007-06-25 19:50:00,2910,"No, there is one on the opposite side of the lake. If memory serves me correctly, its in the river that connects to balsam.  I will double check that tonight, and let you know."
87593,Zamboni,2007-06-25 19:58:00,235,There's launch at Rosedale marina....that is probably the one Stoty means on river. There is another launch at Coboconk if your boating in from that river.....see launch at south bay I never tried.
