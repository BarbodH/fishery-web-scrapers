Any how, it was as windy as hell and it was my first time on the lake (and my first time fishing on my recently aquired boat) so I didn't do all that great. I had to limit myself to a small bay in the SE section where I still managed to catch a walleys (17"") and 3 SM between 1lb and 2lb. They were all caught near shore close to a point in about 5-7'  I'm eager to give this lake another shot.  I'd like to include more pics, but this site alows a VERY limited file size...Anyone know a way around that? I reduced my pics but they're still all b/w 150 and 190 kb "

87031,Hellfish,2007-06-24 12:54:00,308,Try hosting the pictures on a photo site like photo bucket and post the  tags and u can fit more on it.

87234,fishboy,2007-06-25 03:42:00,550,nice pickeral-that's a lake I've planned to get to for a while; I'd better get at it by the looks of things
87313,b2kptbo,2007-06-25 13:16:00,1505,"Yes that lake has some good rock, if you don't know it you were smart to stick too one area if the water is rough and ya didn't come away empty handed WTG..."
