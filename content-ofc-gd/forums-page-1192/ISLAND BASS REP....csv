86945,Mike the Pike,2007-06-24 00:27:00,3421,Urby nice pic of the largemouth sounds like you put the newbie on fish and sacrificed your fishing to accomidate your buddy.  MTP
86951,mikeymikey,2007-06-24 00:47:00,376,"What lure did you use to catch those?  Topwater frog?  Because I seen many bass cruising around and most of them just wouldn't bite even when I had the bait right on it's face.  I think it is because they are guarding their spawn area.  When ever sunfish gets near bass would chase them away.  Yet when I toss'd in a plastic baits bass just ignored it. Totally.  I did end up getting one large one after like 20+ cast to same fish over and over and working on it.  It did finally sucked in my Strike King 3X Zero White stick bait. (I love this bait, i tried to cut off a little bit off the end with my finger and I couldn't because it is so elestic~ yet super soft.  This plastic is just amazing durable and super soft)  I'll upload my pics later."
86952,urbanangler1990,2007-06-24 00:50:00,933,"caught on a 5 inch senko, green and creme, we playing it infront of its face for long time, many casts it took, i think it got fed up of it and picked it up, yes i also noticed their still kinda in gaurd mode..."
86954,mattyk,2007-06-24 00:51:00,2110,nice!
86986,007,2007-06-24 03:31:00,537,Congrats on 'your' bass. I accidentally hooked some bass at the islands last week about that size - I don't think they have packed on much weight yet so I would say it is more like 4lbs!  Don't worry I'm sure you'll catch one of your own soon.  Might be out there tomorrow. 007
86988,FishFinder,2007-06-24 03:34:00,481,"you could have pulled a BBR and said its your fish. lol just kidding, nice bucket. better luck next time in catching your own fish."
86996,Ben_Daniels,2007-06-24 04:49:00,435,"yea the ones i caught in my report were both still on beds, they ignored like four different baits, it was like i was playing a chess match with this fish for two hours."
87078,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-24 16:05:00,0,Nice catch!
