Had the whole river to myself . . .     just me & the ducks! This brood can't be more than a few days old . . .     and are under the watchful eye of Momma Duck EVERY second. It must be her second brood . . .     many of the first batches of ducklings are completely feathered out & flying now . . . .     Even at this tender age, they still come running when I set my groundbait bucket down!! Here's 7 l'il stuffed ducks, taking a nap (just polished off about a pound of groundbait) with guard!    I'm thinking I might take my ice auger up this morning . . . .     T W N says only +5 presently . . . .     but, it might be a while before I get another shot at 'em, so I'd better make the best of it!"

86875,dsn,2007-06-23 13:50:00,1018,Awwwe no shots of them feeding off your gorund bait?  I love the last shot you took of the duck going into you bucket and helping themselves its harlious.  I occasionally get the sparrow or redwind black bird go after my can of corn. When I'm out. I think the birds are catching on to us. I'll try to get a shot of it next time I'm out.  dsn

86917,Smokey,2007-06-23 22:50:00,1278,It was a chilly one this morn in the Kawarthas for sure. I got up at 5am for work and was thinking of riding the motorbike into Toronto but one step outside sure changed my mind fast.
86946,Mike the Pike,2007-06-24 00:30:00,3421,I would rather have cool weather to fish than get fried in the boat all day.Warm clothes can be taken off when it warms up.I burn like a lobster so a clod front is A OK.MTP
87339,wolfville,2007-06-25 14:01:00,396,"Steve, so, how did it go? We had a tough time in CAGI. I am thinking to compensate that with a trip to the east. As long as there's chance to get into fish.  And the ducks are ripened? Let me know if I should bring my BBQ"
