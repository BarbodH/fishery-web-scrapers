Woke up at 7am and prepped the boat and trailer. Picked up some minnows and launched at Port Maitland By 9am the launch parking lot was already full. Just a hunch but might have to do with the bass opener.  Was really looking forward to trying out my new fishfinder. A Lowrance LCX15MT. It put me on the perch today. Not huge numbers but good by my standards.  Fished with the crowd of boats at the mouth just off the rocks in about 23 feet of water. Temps were around 74 degrees. I knew to move when the sonar was showing nothing on the bottom. and each time I moved the bite picked up. After and hour and a half I had 7 keepers in the live well between 10"" and 12"". Threw a back several smaller and had numerous misses. I was using a pickerel rig and twice had two hooked. The perch then moved out and couldn't find them.  Decided to try in the lower Grand River trolling body baits for pickerel but to no avail. Saw numereous fish jump wish I suspect were carp or ling. Always a nice day on the water there. If the bite is slow, the skydivers at the Dunnville airport are fun to watch.  HG"
