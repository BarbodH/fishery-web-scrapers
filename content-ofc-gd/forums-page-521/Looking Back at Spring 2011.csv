597447,laszlo,2011-06-28 02:24:00,487,Spring really is a special time of year. I'll let the pics do most of the talking...  Fidel (Highdrifter) will never forget hand lining this fish after it took him into some wood.           I don't know anyone who can catch as many Steelhead as this man. A pleasure to learn from such a good angler.     Loving my new Pontoon!!!         Fellow creatures.       Yes...I admit it...I LOVE FLY FISHING FOR CARP. That's right.         Thanks Laszlo
