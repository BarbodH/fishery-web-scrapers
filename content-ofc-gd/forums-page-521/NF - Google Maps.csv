596799,John Bacon,2011-06-26 04:44:00,3277,Is it just my computer of is there something up with Google Maps?  Everytime I try to use Google Maps my Firefox crashes.  IE didn't crash but it didn't display a map.
596800,OutdoorDan,2011-06-26 04:50:00,325,Works fine here. What version of FF are you using?
596817,Jer,2011-06-26 12:07:00,1426,"Are you talking about Google Earth?  My Google Earth application totally disappeared from my system a few weeks ago, desktop icon and all. I tried reloading a few times and it would go through the whole download and install procedure but still would not show up anywhere.  Finally I ""un-installed"" the program (it was still listed), downloaded it again and it's been working fine.  I'm not sure, but this may been about the same time I upgraded IE to version 9."
596904,John Bacon,2011-06-26 19:37:00,3277,"No, it is Google Maps that is giving me a problem.  Firefox crashes when I try to access it, IE doesn't crash but it doesn't work either.  With IE I get a message stating that they don't have maps at this zoom level for this region.  This all started a few days ago.  I am running Firefox 3.0"
596907,Terry,2011-06-26 19:54:00,14456,they have firefox 5 now you may just need to update to access the site
596924,OutdoorDan,2011-06-26 21:21:00,325,"Yep, 3.0 is way outdated. Here's the latest one:  http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-5.0&os=win&lang=en-US"
596929,jediangler,2011-06-26 21:39:00,1923,Working fine for me on Safari.
596942,mercman,2011-06-26 22:36:00,7054,"It's been very slow loading at times. I am using IE 8.0 . I think the updated thier java script, or changed the version.Improperly written javascript can play havoc on a web browser."
596946,umKthxbye,2011-06-26 22:51:00,247,"yeah FF 5 just came out, I haven't had any google maps issues on any FF versions."
597081,John Bacon,2011-06-27 04:12:00,3277,Thanks for the replies.  I upgraded both Firefox and IE; Google Maps works on both of them.  I guess they may have made a change to the web site that requires that can't be handled by old broswers.
