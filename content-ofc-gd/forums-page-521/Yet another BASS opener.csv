597148,LucG,2011-06-27 12:48:00,779,"Headed out Sat morning disapointed with the rainy weather, but was glad there was no chance of lightning. Allthough we did not get poured on, there was a constant mist/drizzle all morning. Started off the day going for largies and managed to hook one nice hawg right away, but then the fishing died off with only a few hammer handles to show for. Gave up the slop and decided to try and find some active smallies. Ended up doing really well on rocky shoals and shorelines using senkos and chigger craws fishing very slow.  Here are a few pics of the nicer fish of the day. Hope everbody had a fun opener!      "
