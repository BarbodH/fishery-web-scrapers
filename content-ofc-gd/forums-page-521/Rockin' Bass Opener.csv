597169,johnnyb,2011-06-27 13:49:00,3413,"I wasn’t sure that I’d get a lot of bass fishing in this weekend….as I was on Gull Lake again, and I really like chasing the lakers.  However, by the time Saturday morning rolled around, I was too tired to get the portable downrigger and rodholder mounted on the boat….and I only had a couple hours to myself anyway.  I grabbed the leadcore just in case the bass didn’t co-operate, and headed to a nearby corner of the lake where I’ve caught a few bass over the years.  Started out a little after 7am with a clown coloured Clackin’Rap, and promptly lost 2 decent fish.  Didn’t feel like they were hooked that well….I suspect the wide gap treble was grabbing them in the side of the face.  At this point, I figured I’d try something new….wacky rigging.  You’d think I would have tried this by now….and I really wish I hadn’t waited so long!  The fish just ate it up, and, using a wide gap worm hook, I hardly missed any hooksets. (Thanks for the confidence boost on hook choice, Garry2r's)   By the time 9am rolled around, I had boated 8 largemouth, 1 smallmouth, and many many rockbass.  And all I really did was work a couple hundred feet of shoreline!  I was pretty pleased with myself, and definitely got the bass bug fired up again  A few pics….      This guy wasn’t net worthy – I just wanted to get ONE in the boat on the clackin’Rap  LOL    That bulge in his belly turned out to be a 3.5” sunfish…now I’m kicking myself for not buying the larger LiveTarget  pumpkinseed    Love this shot of my little girl…who demanded to see some fish when I came back in    The rest of Saturday was consumed with “Big Music Fest”…a fantastic concert in Bobcaygeon that Laker Jessy and I thoroughly enjoyed.  I mention it, because some of you were likely there, and I saw THIS, which simply must be shared:    Hope you all had a great opener….bring on the weekend!!!!  "

597180,ctranter,2011-06-27 14:15:00,543,"  Haha funny enough, I have used the smallest size pumkinseed crank for 2 years now, but I upgraded to a bigger one this year and it got chewed apart from all the small smallies this weekend.  I'm definitely a fan"

597282,Lunatic,2011-06-27 18:23:00,536,"awesome, the colour on the netted bass is just awesome. i know what you mean with the whacky rig, i caught a few 3 and 4 pounders on it on sunday."
597428,solopaddler,2011-06-28 01:34:00,8605,"Great stuff bud! Y'know I grew up fishing Gull lake for bass, my uncle had a cottage there for years.  I used to do pretty well, lots of big bass.  Nice to see there's still a few left."
