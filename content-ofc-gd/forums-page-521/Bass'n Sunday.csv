596886,Terry,2011-06-26 18:22:00,14456,"so where to begin  I had to work Saturday so I had to miss bass opener I didn't get all my work done so I had to work a couple of hours sunday too. went to work at 5 am so I could go fishing after and was done by 7 am, so I was good to go  as many know my boat has been giving me lots of problems, so I decided to put my boat in the river in Bradford and flip the banks for bass and I wouldn't be too far from the ramp if things don't work well  she started right up and got up on plane, so I ran down the river to a really good spot, I passed about 6 boats on the way all flipping the first spot there was a boat on it  the second spot ..there were 2 boats on it so I ran to the best spot..boats everywhere..there must be a tourney going on  so I just picked a spot to flip  an hour of flipping and not a bite  so I moved, I saw some shore that looked alive so I stopped  the fish started biting, nothing big but there are bass  I was by myself so I didn't take many pictures but here are a few          a good day fishing well I got out on opening weekend and I have not missed one ever so that made me happy  the boat ran good most of the time...it gave me trouble twice getting up on plane Have you ever been driving along and something seems wrong you look around check everything..can't see anything wrong..then you feel a vibration ....you stop and see this     the Gods just don't want me to fish this year...LOL oh well that's what we have spares for   now where can I go next weekend"

596891,Terry,2011-06-26 19:07:00,14456,"if anyone could figure out what is wrong, we could get it fixed...it always runs good for the mechanic..then dies on the water for me  it has spent more time in the shop then out this year"
596893,misfish,2011-06-26 19:13:00,29133,"Oh, look at those tinnie wennie guys.  You needed a guy at the back of the boat to pick up on the bigg,ns.LOL  You hit the normal spots bud? How was the water level? Bet it was up and made for hard fishing, not finding the floaters to easy.  So tell me,when are you going to stop breaking stuff?   Was going to pm you saturday afternoon, about fishing today,but I had plans,,,,,so I was told.  I,ll be back saturday night from pops, if you want to flip on Sunday."

596925,Terry,2011-06-26 21:21:00,14456, I did not hit many good spots I think there was a tourney and many boats all up and down the river taking most of the better spots
596930,daryl0815,2011-06-26 21:42:00,225,"Looks like a decent day, at least you got out and got some fish! I was digging in dirt and clay all day, you had a better day than I had, even with the bulge in the tire!"
597140,johnnyb,2011-06-27 12:39:00,3413,I think you're right about the tournament....Dave Mercer and JP DeRose were fishing a Simcoe tournament together....so his facebook status said...  At least you got out...got some fish...got back...and didn't blow a tire  Good luck next weekend!

597290,Terry,2011-06-27 18:55:00,14456," I love them  back in the day, when there were only 3 people fishing the river that way, it was unbelievable........the fish and the size was to die for  the first 3 or so years that I flipped the banks a guy named Hank Gibson and a guy Named Dan Fountan(SP) were the only other people I ever saw there...it was soooooooo easy"
