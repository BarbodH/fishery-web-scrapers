596989,Stoty,2011-06-27 00:42:00,2910,Anyone know where the results from today's tourney are posted online?
597255,lhousesoccer,2011-06-27 17:25:00,442,"There's nothing on the CBFL website.  They don't even have archived results up yet from 2010, but they do have 2007, 2008 and 2009.  There's not link anywhere on the page for current tourney results.  Can't figure out why.  My 20-member bass club does a better job keeping our website current!"
597268,charlesn,2011-06-27 17:46:00,551,Winning weight was 25.85 - Joey Muszynski and Scott Murison (both 2nd time winners although they each won before with different partners) 2nd was Barry Graves and his partner (my apologies for not knowing his name when I really should).  They had 25.65 I think.  23.80 was 3rd last year's defending champs Chris Vandermeer and Jeff Slute.  Nick Cousvis and his partner (again apologies) were 4th with 23.60.  I think the last pay spot was just over 21 lbs.  Paid 19 spots.  93 boats total.  I think 18 lbs got you about 35th place.  What a great fishery.  Congrats to Joey and Scott - bragging rights for yet another year!

597295,charlesn,2011-06-27 19:13:00,551, Thanks Phill - just got lucky for once on that lake - don't expect it to happen again soon (or ever again).  No big bags of largies that I saw Brian.  In fact during the brief time that I watched the weigh-in while waiting to trailer and after trailering - I didn't see any get weighed.  I do know some teams did target them though as I heard them talking about it.  I know a lot of teams also just try for the big largemouth money if their smallies aren't going as a bail out plan.  Charles - my apologies to Jason G and Henry V - getting old means you don't remember so good any more.

597551,F_ast,2011-06-28 12:51:00,154,Heard Leo Stakos (FishTV) got big fish... That True?
597557,Harrison,2011-06-28 13:06:00,2202, They got the biggest Largemouth......no irony there.
