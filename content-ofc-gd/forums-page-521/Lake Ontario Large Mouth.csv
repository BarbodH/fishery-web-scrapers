He put up a good fight and he hit on the lure that has caught well over 30 bass so far this year lol. I will hopefully have some more pics tomorrow to I am heading out somewhere if the thunder and lightning holds off.  First Largemouth of the year.   Sorry the pic is not good I forgot my camera and used my cell then had to lighten it. Thanks"
