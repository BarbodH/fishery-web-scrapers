595072,Guest gbfisher,2011-06-21 17:11:00,0, When you find an indestructible lure that will not wear out. Please.....buy me one too.... That one reason alone is why I make my own.  And they work and wear out as well...
595075,BillM,2011-06-21 17:16:00,17367,"As long as the missing eye to bite mark ratio is high, I couldn't care what happens to the lure, lol."
597672,Eazy,2011-06-28 19:00:00,260," Hmmmm.......I've have to say, Ghost and the Olive one, but haven't yet given the hothead a whirl for Pikes yet!"
597684,addy79,2011-06-28 19:34:00,573,"The Olive Clackin Minnow is my new FAV! similar to the xrap. as for xrap colour, whites definitley my favourite"
594395,coreyhkh,2011-06-19 23:44:00,163,I have to say xraps have become my Favorite lure they catch fish but they seem to fall apart with out much effort like the eyes or the paint always come off mine in as little as a week.  Anyone else have this problem.
594399,crossover,2011-06-19 23:53:00,172,They don't work for me. How do you fish them? Do you jerk it or just retrieve it?
594402,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-20 00:01:00,1107,I have had some that fall right apart fast but I also have some that last forever I have been using the same clown color one for 4 seasons now and landed tonnes of smallies and pike on it   mabey the ones that are made on fridays fall apart and the rest are good.
594405,Cookslav,2011-06-20 00:08:00,1457,"I've not had any issues to date, I trawl them though...I find there action can be killer when crawling at a snails pace for tight lipped Pickerel, and also pretty good on a planners eratic pulls."
594413,mbosh1980,2011-06-20 00:49:00,349,"I find the paint on colours such as ""hot steel"" chip, but other than that no problems."
594417,houski,2011-06-20 01:06:00,61,"I agree. Xraps are awesome, but they def. aren't the toughest bait out there. Same thing can be said for Husky Jerks. Great baits, but some of em are garbage right out of the box, some of them are done after a fish or two. Then however, you seem to get that magic bait, that keeps putting fish after fish in the boat, no worse for wear."
594418,beginner,2011-06-20 01:06:00,542,"mine just came off after less than a week, when I did pike fishing in spring... I guess they dont do quality vs quantity anymore..."
594458,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-20 02:37:00,1622,"No problem with any of my so far, now watch them all start to fall apart SBK"
594461,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 02:42:00,4661,I find most rapalas have this issue... I go threw 10 taildancers a year cause of paint alone... Not to mention cut offs... Break offs... And straightened hooks and split rings...  But they do catch fish... Lol
594488,Bly,2011-06-20 03:17:00,1556,"Haven't used too many of the xraps but trash a few husky jerk paint jobs a year.  I repaint and keep tossing as long as they keep catching, cheaper than replacing."
594518,rbaquial,2011-06-20 10:17:00,968,I've had the same problems with the eyes too. I take my off - then re-glue then back on with some Crazy Glue - problem seems to have resolved since.
594525,fish_fishburn,2011-06-20 11:34:00,1311,I have issues with Taildancers as well.  Some of them have paint chunks the size of a dime falling off after just one day on the water. Seems to be an adhesion problem.
594526,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 11:44:00,4661,"But the balsa rapalas don't do  this... It's only pkastic ones...  Husky jerk- plastic ""deep"" taildancer ""Crome""- plastic X rap - plastic Original floater- wood Tail dancer ( not crome)- wood  Any wood rapalas keep their paint... Even after a battle with a musky...  Plastic ... I've killed in one day use"
594537,NAW,2011-06-20 12:08:00,4022,"I was just noticing the same thing last weekend.  My perch patern still looks brand new, but my other one, which has been used half as much, it all chipped up around the hooks.  Likely from bounching around going from spot to spot.."
594561,Garry2Rs,2011-06-20 13:05:00,1425,"Good point about the plastic vs. Balsa baits.  I have a blue and white Husky Jerk that most of the paint fell off of right away.  It looks diseased, but it still catches fish...I have a Ghost Minnow HJ, where the paint (what little there is) is still perfect after three seasons of heavy use...However there was a foil strip glued to the spine of the bait, inside the body.  This strip has fallen off and now sort of floats around in the cavity.  This isn't the quality that I expect from Rapala, but that said, this bait also still catches fish."
594562,Eazy,2011-06-20 13:05:00,260,"These work great for a variety of species, but I think think that nothing will stand up to toothy critters (pike) except ol' Len thompsons and Dardevles...........I like to cast with these spoons,but keep a X-rap handy to switch to if you get a follow up,which results almost in a guarantee fish!"
594699,bassmaster4,2011-06-20 18:14:00,801,"i agree they tend to come apart but from my experience they mostly have come apart at my fault, i was removing a snag and it flew out and smashed a log, it wouldnt swim right. Ive caught a lot of pike on them this year and the only thing that has gone wrong with it is the paint job and the feathers on the tail are gone. It is a good lure, just not a very durable one for people whos gear takes a beating."
594710,bubbles,2011-06-20 18:44:00,591,"Yep, mine fall apart all the time, eyes and the paint.  Too bad becasue they do cacth a lot of fish."
594726,NAW,2011-06-20 19:23:00,4022,Is there any way to touch up the on these?  I would think that matching the colour would be tough.
594881,Muskieman,2011-06-21 01:12:00,2472,"I have a hard time keeping the paint on the Perch & Clown patterns.. not to mention they eyes falling out and breaking the ""bills"" lips.  Slapping these baith on the water to remove weeds is a NO NO.  But I also agree that they do catch fish  Randy "
594905,coreyhkh,2011-06-21 02:07:00,163,I lost another eye tonight and some how the hook came off one????  Does anyone no where to buy new eye do craft stores sell stuff like that?   On another note what colours do people like the best?
594951,bassmaster4,2011-06-21 05:15:00,801,i like the silver blue color for pike
594952,irishfield,2011-06-21 05:20:00,26272,OMG... the paint came off a plastic lure!
595050,mike rousseau,2011-06-21 15:38:00,4661,  Favorite color changes every year... Walleye are funny when it comes to that
595068,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-21 16:53:00,479,"Funny enough, i was fishing with them by a low-hanging bridge. Countless times, I smacked the lure against the concrete bridge, with a ""pooper' remark that followed. Those remarks were all for naught, because it still looked brand new. hah. I eventually lost it when it was caught amongst some rocks and I'll assume it still looks new underneath the waters.  This was bought from Canadian Tire."
