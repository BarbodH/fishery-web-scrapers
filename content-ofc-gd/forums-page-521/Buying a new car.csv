593467,mattp33,2011-06-15 22:30:00,290,I hope there are not any car salesmen on here reading this  I think they are payed off a % of gross and when we haggle down to having no gross in the car they dont get payed.  How much should someone make from selling a car?  What is a fair markup on a car i wonder? If you are buying a $20 000 car what should the salesperson make?  And what should a dealership make?
593468,irishfield,2011-06-15 22:34:00,26272,"My local Ford salesman gets $200 for selling a car, regardless of the sale price."
593478,mattp33,2011-06-15 22:57:00,290,is that it?  WOW  he must have to sell like 6 a week to make a living!  I give the guys props that have the guts to work off straight commission!

593496,kickingfrog,2011-06-15 23:53:00,8333,Thanks Burt.  The single note you play is old and tired bob. Toyoto had nothing to compare for what I wanted/needed. If they had I would have driven it because they do a good job.
593500,Billy Bob,2011-06-15 23:56:00,5865," Oh, sorry I upset you buddy...it was a tongue and cheek remark for fun...good luck on your choice. Bob"
593601,pikehunter,2011-06-16 09:50:00,1659,"Doesn't matter how great a deal you think you got...remember this. They just shafted ya good. If they didn't get you negotiating they'll get ya when the deal is closed.  After you're done with the sales dude it's then up to the add on rep to get into your wallet. That's where the real money is made. Just wait and see how they will pull out all the ropes to get their paws into your pocket. Not only that but everything they try to sell you is way over priced. Refuse the theft insurance scam sticker and engraving too that they say is part of the added admin fees, what a ripoff!  Good luck, you are entering into their world now. There is no such thing as a good deal, they always get their money, they just change the wording around to make it sound good."
593644,blue pickeral,2011-06-16 13:35:00,267," Researching ahead of time actually helps out the salesperson as you know what you want, what you want to pay and not wasting his/her time as a 'tire kicker'.  As mentioned previously, I get a quote from www.apa.ca and you know you are at least going to get this deal no haggling involved. The apa dealer is some distance from us, so gave closer dealerships the opportunity to at least match (initally beat) the price. None would. But established this in 5 minutes including a visit to the sales manager."
597452,kickingfrog,2011-06-28 02:34:00,8333,"Thanks for the tips.  Here is another site to consider if you are in the market for a new car.  http://www.unhaggle.com/   BTW If you are thinking of buying a new car this summer or early fall you might find your choices are limited or non-existant. Subaru, Volkswagen and Kia all had me ready to sign a deal, but they had no vehicles to sell me (I bet that's a kick in the pants for the salespeople). A few others told me the same thing before I even got in the door. All wanted me to hold out until the fall for their 2012s. I would have, but I did not want to take the chance that I would have to repair something on my old car. I did get a great deal on the car I settled on, but I'll be looking to turn it over sooner rather than later."
597491,Sinker,2011-06-28 04:36:00,8692,"So, what did you get? Just curious.....I like my subaru's, but I'm not a big fan of the lagacy for some reason. Still a good vehicle though, and I'm sure miles ahead of any toyota  P.S I'm fishing with Bob this week, I'll make sure to trash toyota lots for us all on the board!! I hope he can catch fish  S."

592741,pikeguy,2011-06-14 00:14:00,195,"i always low ball them to get them going. Say 20,000 for a car i will offer 14,000 knowing there is no way that will happen. then hope they will respond with something decent. if not i ask what i will get with it (goodies i hope) and i always ask for a tank of gas never believe them when they say that's as low as i can go try to go a little lower   just bought the wife's car got a good deal this way, and i go with my family when they want to by a car i love to haggle."
592751,GBW,2011-06-14 00:21:00,8460,"walk out when you don't like the price after a bit of going back and forth, if they have room to do the deal they chase you.  If they let you go (and you are not rude about it) then they may not of had room to move to your price point.  then you know (sort of) of the wiggle room.  always ask for more like free window tinting and stuff like that too."
592771,mercman,2011-06-14 00:43:00,7054,"If you are buying new, do your homework. Visit the online showroom, and choose the car you want with the options you want, then go see them and try not to look too interested.Scope out the competion for simalr vehicules, and let the dealer you choose know that you are just begining to look around, that you are looking at visiting the other dealers to look at X car or truck(something in the same style as what you are really interested in)  Ask about incentives and dealer rebates. Like Geoff said, get up and leave for a few minutes. Tell him you need to think in private for a few minutes.  Dealers like to use accesories as a deal sealer."

592794,BillM,2011-06-14 01:11:00,17367,Don't mention a trade until you have got your rock bottom price of the car you want.  Also don't mention how you are going to pay for it (ie outright or financed) until you've got your rock bottom price.  Don't be afraid to walk if you don't get the deal you want.
592804,solopaddler,2011-06-14 01:23:00,8605,"  So true. Your cash purchase price is always better than the so called ""zero percent"" finance rate that so many dealerships are offering.  I love haggling and I love buying vehicles but I'll never buy from a dealership.  I prefer to buy something a year or two old privately.  You save on taxes, the initial depreciation of the vehicle, and there's always way more room to haggle if you find someone desperate enough."
592822,Dutch,2011-06-14 02:01:00,831," Is this still the case?  I thought now with the HST, you had to pay 13% regardless, before HST you saved the 5% GST portion, but now don't you have to pay the entire 13%?  To the OP - pay for a CCC report and offer invoice plus 3% or so.  You can't know what kind of deal you are going to get unless you know what the dealer paid.  Walk in and tell them what car you want and what you want to pay and be prepared to go to another dealer if they won't work with you."
592824,solopaddler,2011-06-14 02:04:00,8605,"  I havn't purchased a vehicle since the HST kicked in, you could be right."

Then if it falls within your budjet and what YOU want , then pull the trigger..  IMO"
592849,BillM,2011-06-14 02:43:00,17367,"The thing about buying privately is that you can get a receipt for a ridiculously low price and pay tax on that, or the book value (which ever is more)  Most private sellers have zero issue with this..  So you'll definitely save on the tax regardless."
592884,Cudz,2011-06-14 04:34:00,2652,"Hey Rob I have been looking at new cars lately and from the dealer there is not much movement on price these days.  IF it is a new car you are looking at, you can usually get a couple things thrown in for free.  For example: At the volks dealership I was offered a 3m clear front protector film and a trailer hitch installed.  I think they can swing those things easier. What car you looking at?  Is it new? Last month a new Sonata (nice looking car) with lots of options was on for 0% finance for 72 months."

I have bought using their service or started a negotiation using the supplied dealer invoice price. Usually go in with exact vehicle/option package, trade, etc. printed out. And go elsewhere until I get my price.  apa also has used car purchase program and vehicle check/appraisal program.  Car Cost Canada will give you prices but no pre-negotiated arrangement."

Now if you have a certain vehicle in mind and want to know it's repair and reliability ratings and customer satisfaction, let me know as I have a internet subscription to Consumers Reports and can copy and paste this via PM or email.

592906,muskeybugged,2011-06-14 11:42:00,282,"My Car Selling days are over but..... Like said before.  1) Car cost worked every time, worth the $40 investment.  2) Leave your trade in out of it, they can hide profit in a trade - in.  3) City dealership have to be more competitive, or at least purchasing from one of those auto park dealerships where there is 10 different dealers on the same block does help.  In addition, this may suck if you have to wait. Your getting all excited about your new ride.  What I did notice is that the factory incentive programs seem to run on a yearly rotation, some better then others.  when doing research, try to go back throughout the previous year and see what the best program they had, that deal is sure to be back again.  That being said, if your excitement gets the better of you, always ask if a better incentive program comes up after you buy - ""Will you honour the better deal"" this is a sometimes yes/no.  Find the newest salesman in the dealership, managers do their best to get them some sales under their belt not as worried about profit lines as much in doing so.  Hope this helps and good luck with the purchase!  One question to you..... What kind of toy you getting?"

You can figure out the invoice price for any new vehicle, as well as the wholesale and retail cost of any add ons. Once you figure out the car's price to a penny, then add a reasonable amount of profit for the dealer (which varies depending upon what you're buying, supply and demand, etc),  go to the dealer and simply show them your figures. stick to it, or damn close to it, or make them prove you wrong. It has never happened to me. Once they know you've done your homework, they'll either sell at your price, or you politely decline, and walk. The biggest lesson I learned from their guide is that we have a lot more leverage than we realize, especially if we know the numbers and how the sales game works.  good luck."

A bunch of 'gotta check with the manager', requests for a 'deposit' to show you're sincere, constant upselling and addition of useless costs such as anti-theft etching, admin fees (name any other business tries to get you to pay their costs - except Hydro 1).
