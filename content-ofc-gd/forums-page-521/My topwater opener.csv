597042,splashhopper,2011-06-27 02:32:00,2931,"Opening week finally arrived. I have been dreaming about bass smashing my topwater lures for a few weeks now.  My plans for heading north got waylayed at the last minute and I was just a little bummed out. But after reading another report here this week on Urban fishing I adjusted my attitude and went with what I could do.   Sleep was almost non-existent Friday night until about 5 am sat when I finally fell asleep "" for just a few more minutes"".... Yeah right... 7 am... shiiite.... I am LATE  Jumped in the truck and wouldn't ya know it... a LINE UP @ TIMMIES on a Saturday morning  Relax ron.... relaaax,.. the fish will still be there... lol  I went to ""my local "" honeyhole and tied on the  ScumFrog( black).  Five minutes later and KERSPLASH,....  he missed it..      Who cares.... I saw it.... my blood was pumping.....  A few minutes later.... another one goes for my black frog..... This time i was TOO EXCITED and didn't wait to FEEL the fish... Winter rust in the topwater technique  Moving on to another access spot.... i toss that frog back out to some lilypads.... KRUNNNCH.....  MISSED again  The good news is that I think I have the right colour frog on.... on cloudy days at this reservoir I always use black.  I decided to walk a ways and try another spot that has produced for me consistently.  On the way to that spot I have to walk across a long boardwalk....Just for the helluvit I stopped and tossed the frog in to six inches of water near a log that was justting out from some bushes at waters edge... Just as the frog came down on the near side of the log.... KRRUNCH.... I wait... one thousand, twothousand.... SET THE HOOK..   FISH ON !.....  I get it on deck.... I AM NOT SKUNKED for the opener...  It wasn't my biggest Largie by any stretch at this location.... who cares... I am not skunked..   It's amazing how much the fishing seems to get better when the pressure of that first fish is off my back.   Here are a few more from the topwater opener:   That frog took a beating   :   And this one felt a LOT BIGGER that it was.... no wonder... i pulled its body weight in weeds in with it   And here was the largest for the weekend.... the pic doesn't do it justice... it was a real fattie... I really need to figure out how to make my arms longer when using my blackberry for pictures:     Thank goodness I read that other URBAN FISHING report this week"

597063,Live2fish85,2011-06-27 02:55:00,1633,Hey Great report. The large mouth got some nice colours to them. Glad to hear you got out and didn't get skunked. Even though Urban isn't nearly as nice and fresh as the north it's better then not fishing at all that's for sure.
597071,Dave Bailey,2011-06-27 03:07:00,1641,"There is nothing, NOTHING, more exciting in fishing than watching a topwater lure get smashed! Looks like you had a great day!"
597124,LucG,2011-06-27 12:13:00,779,Sweet! I love catching on the slop frog!
597145,Homer Is King,2011-06-27 12:44:00,305,Great job! Gotta love top water action!
597167,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-27 13:46:00,1622,Nice to see you made it out Ron & some nice Bass to boot SBK
597322,splashhopper,2011-06-27 20:33:00,2931, Thanks Richard... i should be up your way this weekend...
597323,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-27 20:37:00,2690,"Congrats, sometimes it is nice hitting those close to home spots.  Exactly what I am going to do this weekend for my ""bass opener""...one week late."
597326,splashhopper,2011-06-27 20:42:00,2931,"  It sure is... and with the price of fuel lately, I can even go for dinner after !"
597329,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-27 20:48:00,2690," You know it...I've planned one trip up north, with another in the works, other than that...I plan on doing alot more close to home fishing this year.  Picked up a seasons pass to the local lake/mudhole this past weekend.  Not the greatest fishing in the world, but, a good place to practise those various techniques.  The best thing is, I can throw everything into my boat, and, be launched in ten minutes!"
