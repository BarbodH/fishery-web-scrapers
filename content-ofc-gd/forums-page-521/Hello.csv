Driving me to the hospital went above and beyond my friend, but really, it sure gave us some good alone time to chat and learn a bit more about each other without the guys around eh!!!  Cheers,  Joey"
596724,Terry,2011-06-26 01:08:00,14456,Hi Betty welcome aboard

596867,Jewelbee,2011-06-26 16:23:00,422,Nice to see you join the board! Welcome
596872,danc,2011-06-26 17:02:00,4677,Hi Betty. Nice to see you here. You must be a very strong woman to live with a Dale Jr.fan.
596876,Spiel,2011-06-26 17:21:00,9065,"Hi Betty Ann or or is it Bettyann, Betty Anne, Bettie Ann....I could go on but let's just leave it at welcome and it was sure nice meeting you at Lakair!"
596908,John,2011-06-26 19:59:00,2956,"Hi Betty, nice to finally meet you............and Brian of course. Hope you plan to make it an annual event. Welcome aboard."
596914,Bettyboop,2011-06-26 20:31:00,5,"Thank you for the welcome, was nice to meet Brians friends and new ones for me.  As for DaleJR,Im a fan too."
596921,danc,2011-06-26 21:02:00,4677, That makes you fair game then too Betty. You never should have admitted that. Where's Dale running right now? I believe he's in the garage with a hole in his engine.   :rofl2:
596922,misfish,2011-06-26 21:08:00,29133,"Unlike her Dan,I have a sence of humor.LOL  Tread softly my friend.  Dale got caught up in some track crap."
596923,danc,2011-06-26 21:18:00,4677, Yea it happens Brian. I'm hoping that JJ redeems himself after last weeks disaster. I'm looking forward to Daytona under the lights next weekend. I'll bet that you are too. Oh. And tell Betty that I was only kidding.
597248,aplumma,2011-06-27 16:56:00,6896,Hi Betty glad to meet you at lak air and welcome to the board. Hopefully you won't view this as being as big a mistake as marrying Brian.  Art
