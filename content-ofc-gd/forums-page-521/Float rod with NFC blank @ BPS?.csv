597014,BillM,2011-06-27 01:32:00,17367,What did it say on it?  They make a 13 and 13'6 if I'm not mistaken..  Dunno anyone that's taken the plunge on one yet though.
597112,okumasheffield,2011-06-27 11:19:00,318,has anyone tried one yet?
597125,misfish,2011-06-27 12:13:00,29133,How much? And what does NFC mean?

597478,okumasheffield,2011-06-28 03:49:00,318, Thanks. Gabe.  Guess I will have to wait for some time.
597513,Spiel,2011-06-28 10:48:00,9065, So after 2 months you finally decided to say something Gabes.
597668,esoxansteel,2011-06-28 18:46:00,1307,"the one in their catalogue is 13ft and features SIC guides and a fixed reel seat for 149.00 cant beat the price, guides are easily over 100.00 alone  "
597710,misfish,2011-06-28 20:45:00,29133,"Not a fix seat guy like have mentioned before,but for that price,worth a try."
