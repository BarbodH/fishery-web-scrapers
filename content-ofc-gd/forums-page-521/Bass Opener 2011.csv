We had big plans of getting out at 3AM but when I woke up to hear the wind howling I hit the snooze button a few times. We finally left the cottage at 5:27 and were on the water by 5:30. I was surprised at the very small lineup at Old Cut for the boat launches.  I had a plan in my head for the day so we started off at one spot. Managed 1 bass there before we moved on.    The second spot of the day was awesome!  We started catching a few pike so I decided to target them while they are co-operating. Well they never did stop co-operating and made for an insanely fun day.              After a while I figured since it's bass opener we better get some more bass over the boat. So we headed to a spot to get some.    Matt managed a nice 10.5"" WGSF          At one point I had a massive hit and this thing gave me a nice fight. All I was thinking was that this thing will get me on the leaderboard, unless it's a sheaphead!  well...    Had to perform surgery on the thing to get my lure back    At 3:30 we headed in to see the leaderboard and watch them give out the prizes. Congrats to Rich on a 5th place finish!  That followed by a dinner at Neighbors restaurant. On the drive back to the cottage we both looked at the lake and decided to keep the fish coming over the side of the boat. Back out we went.      We  nailed them again and I was pretty pumped        It was one hell of an opener. Love when you see the sunrise and the sunset from the boat on the bay! We landed 23 pike and 12 bass as well as a ton of WGSF, perch and others     Dan"
