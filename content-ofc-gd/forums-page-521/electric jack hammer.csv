596926,lew,2011-06-26 21:21:00,12766," And besides that monster bottle of  hooch Brian, there's also 2 cases of beer sitting here,  and I don't drink.  Maybe the makins of an OFC g2g ??"
596931,daryl0815,2011-06-26 21:52:00,225,Is dynamite illegal these days? that would be the funnest way to split those rocks! as long as you dont end up like Wille Coyote!!!
596978,bigbuck,2011-06-27 00:13:00,2449,"Lew, don't go messing around trying to break up those rocks, it's too much work, you can't go thru gardens to truck them out and besides, you are retired, not in jail, making a pile of big rocks into little rocks. Go the topsoil route and build a little rock garden there."
597080,Bob,2011-06-27 03:53:00,370,"Yeah, I understand that Lew.  Not knowing the lay of your property, it just sounded good to me at the time.  If you hit those things on the right lines with an electric hammer, they just might split. If you can even get a groove in them, a steel wedge and sledge would likely get them to break."
597116,F7Firecat,2011-06-27 11:34:00,347,"As a concrete restoration guy heres what I would do.  Take a 14 inch Stihl quick cut with a diamond blade, cut the rocks on minimum of 2 inch centers on a grid even more if you want, or you can drill a series of 1/2 inch holes through them to weaken them  and get a Brute electric jackhammer from a rental place and start chipping.  I would try the sawcutting over drilling.  You can try without saw cutting or drilling but I dont think you will have very much success.  If those rocks are granite they will be tough to split up but it can be done with some hardwork and sweat.  All the equipment can be rented at your local rental store ike Stephensons, Battlefield, United Rentals etc etc"
597118,lew,2011-06-27 11:51:00,12766,"Thanks for another suggestion Firecat, I've used those Quick-cuts before and their definetely a great tool and may work well for me.  I'm gonna be cutting wood today but it's  something I'll think about for sure."
596572,lew,2011-06-25 15:03:00,12766,"I've got some huge boulders at the back of my property that I want to move but their far too heavy to roll or move by hand and I don't want to use my truck as it'll dig up the lawn. I also can't use a come along as there aren't any trees big enuff near-by.   I was thinking of renting an electric jack hammer to break them up into managable sizes but don't know if they'll do the job or not. About the only thing I've ever seen them used for was breaking up concrete.  These rocks are laying around an old firepit that I don't use and are up to 30"" X 30"" X 15""  Anybody ever tried to bust up something this big with an electric jack hammer  ??"
596575,Shorty,2011-06-25 15:06:00,16,"Hi Lew, Guy says depends on the type of rock - send him a picture of the rocks if you can- will give him a better idea."
596578,tb4me,2011-06-25 15:25:00,3295,Lew I would give it a try..You will want a brute breaker. If you have a home depot near by they rent them..I belive they are made by bosch. Good tools..Oh be sure to have a box of beer in the fridge..
596581,skeeter,2011-06-25 15:27:00,1907,"What if you had an extra pair of hands to help move them Lew, could you and I move them? Roll them onto a 2 wheel dolly?"
596585,HTHM,2011-06-25 15:31:00,4082,"A spud bar and ingenuitygo a long way in moving rocks, where you are they are probably granite, so that does not break easily."
596589,lew,2011-06-25 15:46:00,12766,All my kitchen counters are granite but I'm not sure about my boulders   The biggest one at least looks like it could be granite though.  I thought about a large spud Albert but I'm thinking the big guy is gonna go at least a few hundred pounds and I'm certainly not as young as I once was.  Thanks for the offer Dann and I may just take you up on it but it won't be this weekend. Be a good excuse for you & Kelly to come here anyways though.
596590,skeeter,2011-06-25 15:50:00,1907,Just give me a shout. I will email you my cell.
596595,lew,2011-06-25 16:14:00,12766,"Thanks Dann, I'll let you know  Shorty, here's a couple pics for Guy  The 1st one has a 5 gallon gas can beside it for comparison    And here's the rest, the smallest is about twice the size of the proverbial bread box  "
596599,Ron,2011-06-25 16:47:00,1683,"This one for thought Lew,   Not seeing the whole lay out of your property, I'm thinking they built the rock garden around that one boulder.  I have a 9000lb tandem dump trailer, we could either jack em up with the dump on the trailer or the other option would be to get a load of top soil and bury them deeper (just a thought)."
596606,HTHM,2011-06-25 17:54:00,4082,"Those are all granite, you're gonna need hydralics to move the bigg'un If you drive wedges into the stirations it MAY split but I don't think it will go easily."
596607,kickingfrog,2011-06-25 17:57:00,8333,That big one might be directly connected to the shield.
596612,lew,2011-06-25 18:10:00,12766,"Thanks fellas,  the more I look at these brutes and how big they are, burying them under a load of soil may be the most feasible option.  I may still give the hammer a try this week but I'm starting to have my doubts now."
596617,LeXXington,2011-06-25 18:34:00,1928,Just a thought but could that be the tip of the proverbial ice berg? It may be bigger under the ground.  Make a nice rock though.
596632,bushart,2011-06-25 19:42:00,2628,Build an Inukshuk---then it's a conversation piece---add a solar light---bingo
596647,pikeguy,2011-06-25 21:09:00,195,Hey Lew them some nice rocks you got there a hammer will most likely do the job.The only thing is if its soft ground under the rock it will take longer. look for cracks or change in  color in the rock that will be a week point like when it goes from grey to black or you can go into the white part be careful its brittle. another option is to dill holes in the rock then use the hammer that works well to to bad you don't live closer i would grab rock drill and take care of that in no time. But these are options that we use when we need to bust rock with out mining tools around  we also have this product around here all you have to do is drill some holes and poor this stuff into the holes cap them over night and in the morning its split i can not remember what its called or were we got it last time but i will try and find out and let you know.
596660,dave524,2011-06-25 22:14:00,4508, Forcite???? got a light
596671,lew,2011-06-25 23:16:00,12766," Thanks Guy, some good info there.  Doesn't show up too well in the photo's but most of the rocks have very pronounced veins running thru them so I'll start the cuts there. I also saw that liquid promoted on one of the DIY shows and it looks like a pretty slick product.  I'm busy for the next couple days but then I'll go rent the hammer and see what happens. Can't  be too expensive for a day or 2  and if it doesn't work I'm not out too much and I'll move on to ""Plan B"".....a big pile of top soil to bury the rocks"
596686,misfish,2011-06-26 00:26:00,29133,"Hi ya Lew.  Im off to do some jack hammering for my pop this up coming weekend.No rocks,just old concrete walk ways and a big pad. The rental is going to be 60 bucks a day. Thats up north,so maybe cheaper yer way.   I would go with the cover with soil and plant.JMO bud.   Oh ya,I bought some leaders."
596809,Bob,2011-06-26 11:27:00,370,"How about parking the truck in a handy spot and hook the come-along to the truck?  Oh yeah, chock the wheels."
596829,lew,2011-06-26 12:53:00,12766," Your gonna save alot more $$$$ on lures than you payed for those leaders Brian  I already considered the truck and come-along Bob but I'd have to drive  across 200' of lawns to get to the rock pile, which I'd rather not do, and then I'd have to drive right thru the middle of the wife's veggie garden and if I did that, I'd be moving into the garage...permanentely"
596831,misfish,2011-06-26 12:56:00,29133,"  From the pictures you posted of it Lew,I dont see the problem,,,,,,,,,"
596832,lew,2011-06-26 13:05:00,12766,You could have a point there Brian
596910,mercman,2011-06-26 20:08:00,7054,  Shoulda been an internal designer
596912,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-26 20:14:00,10439,"All you need is a rock drill, case of beer, ANFO and some friends and ya got yerself the makin's of a fine redneck party!!!!    :rofl2:"
596913,misfish,2011-06-26 20:19:00,29133," Hey Dave,I know first hand,Diane has a  new to her,big jug of rye. That will do."
