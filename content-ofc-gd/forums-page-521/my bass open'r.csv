596945,umKthxbye,2011-06-26 22:48:00,247,Bass any good to eat? I know people eat them but my uncle Randy always told me they tasted like wood?
596951,LegitFish,2011-06-26 23:07:00,69, I love bass!
596986,beginner,2011-06-27 00:28:00,542,thnx paul....   yes umkthxbye is good for steam or fry...
597005,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-27 01:18:00,1107, Smallies that size out of cold water are great eating
597019,Live2fish85,2011-06-27 01:40:00,1633,"Way to go bfisher nice ones, the best way to eat bass I find is in the fire wrapped in tin foil with butter, garlic, lemon, salt, pepper and onions, IMO the best way to cook a bass."
597038,umKthxbye,2011-06-27 02:21:00,247,What about a large mouth?
597043,Live2fish85,2011-06-27 02:35:00,1633,I've never eatin a large mouth just smallies and for the most part I don't eat to many bass only ones that I hook bad. For the most part I'm filling up on fresh lake erie perch and walleye. I have seen lots of people eat them. Best way to find out is to try it out.
597045,splashhopper,2011-06-27 02:38:00,2931,sounds like it was a blast....
597107,fish_fishburn,2011-06-27 11:07:00,1311,Largies taste way better then smallies.
597172,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-27 13:55:00,1622,"Congrats on your day, I don't eat Bass but then again I don't eat Trout, Pike, Salmon, Walleye or any other kind of fish, but that's another story SBK"
597201,beginner,2011-06-27 15:31:00,542,thnx guys it was excellent alot of fish...
597243,johnnyb,2011-06-27 16:41:00,3413,"Nicely done, Bfisher....way to make a day of it even though you had to work.  I threw my bass fillets on the bbq this weekend....delicious!  Pre-heat the grill and they won't stick or fall apart....wife loves it now because I use no oil or butter    Silly girl"
597355,beginner,2011-06-27 22:05:00,542, thnks johnny... lolz u bugger.... (no oil or butter)
597467,limeyangler,2011-06-28 03:10:00,5204,"Great report B!  I also get a lot of half days fishing outings before work, good way to prepare IMO.  Nice fishes man, sounds like you had 'em dialed in pretty good.  I'd be interested in how you prepare the 'steamed' bass.....a recipe i think would be well worth posting  I have to agree with fishburn though.....sm bass taste good...but Largies tatse even better."
597474,fishboy,2011-06-28 03:40:00,550,nice looking fish-congrats
