596962,Beans,2011-06-26 23:37:00,3339,  I think I will leave Stinky and Smelly at home tomorrow...  I had one good hit that peeled off about 4 feet of line then dropped the bait...the only other bumps were from the ducks and weeds catching the line in the current...

597382,Beans,2011-06-27 23:38:00,3339,I guess the odour from Stinky and Smelly lingered on from yesterday...one good hit but no runners today for me...  CPH landed one carp about fifteen pounds...looked good on him as he has been blanked three times this year already...
