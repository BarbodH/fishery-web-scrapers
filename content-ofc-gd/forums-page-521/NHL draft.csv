596393,BASSKILLA19,2011-06-24 22:25:00,9,Anyone plan on watching the draft tonight?Lets see the leafs blow the draft like they always do.LOL
596397,kickingfrog,2011-06-24 22:40:00,8333,Nothin' else planned for tonight. Laptop and tv set for the drama. I wonder if yesterday was the big day thought?
596405,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-24 23:06:00,2690,"Just saw Cory Schneider is available...man, if I was Vancouver I'd be keeping him and getting rid of Luongo!!!"
596412,kickingfrog,2011-06-24 23:26:00,8333, Easier typed than done however. Big and long salary.
596414,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-24 23:28:00,2690," I agree, and, nobody wants to eat that salary after his overall playoff performance.  Especially his road games."
596416,myot,2011-06-24 23:36:00,131,The winner of the draft is the team who takes Adam Larson he is a stud
596419,Grimace,2011-06-24 23:48:00,2020,Bettman did not want to get booed so he hid behind a mourning family.
596420,kickingfrog,2011-06-24 23:49:00,8333, Yep.
596422,Grimace,2011-06-24 23:52:00,2020,Now that the big 4 are gone we might see some trading up and down.
596424,Grimace,2011-06-25 00:11:00,2020,Jets!!!!!!   They did the right thing.  I am glad they gave the people of Winnipeg the Jets back.
596425,Grimace,2011-06-25 00:12:00,2020,No Jersey?   They should have had the Jersey ready.
596427,kickingfrog,2011-06-25 00:25:00,8333,Makes me think that they may have been close to going with something different.
596462,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-25 02:12:00,10439,Well their first pick looks like a good one. They traded their #30 1st rd and a 2nd rd pick to Anaheim for #22 1st rd and got right winger Tyler Biggs.  We'll have to wait a few minutes to see if they hold onto their #25 pick or trade it away.
596464,BASSKILLA19,2011-06-25 02:15:00,9,Is Biggs any good Ive never heard anything about him until now?
596597,ryan a harris,2011-06-25 16:38:00,17,"I liked the Leafs move of the day. Liles will help to replace the loss of that Kaberle guy (I hope). Also adding Rick Dudley looks like a good move, I like that one alot. The devils got the player they needed, I was thinking the Oilers were going to take Larson, they need help on D. Draft day is always one of my fav days of the year."
596894,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-26 19:14:00,0,"sens managed to make out with 3 first round picks and stole Nikita Filatov.  He's had some issues with his development in Colombus, but for the price Murray paid it's well worth the risk.  and for any buffalo sabres fans, Daniel Catenacci is a hell of a speedy hockey player.  He's a bit small but he plays bigger, is fearless, and has a bit of a nasty side."
596932,daryl0815,2011-06-26 21:58:00,225,"I dont mind the Liles trade, although it is a little suspicious that they basically gave him away for next to nothing.  I am not too big on the draft picks that they made, Biggs seems like another 3rd liner, the leafs have about 3 or 4  3rd lines now! but I guess that deep in the draft there is not to much left to pick from, I just expected them to pick someone with a little more offensive upside.  Burke seems to have a real bias towards US players, I dont know if it is good or bad, but it just seems like the blue and white should add some stars and stripes to their jerseys!"
596967,Rizzo,2011-06-26 23:48:00,4754,"Wonder where this Biggs character was ranked to go? I guess they really felt someone was going to take him in the next 3 picks and they absolutely had to have him. For a guy with 3rd line potential (so the reports say) I would have waited and grabbed him at 25...if he's gone, grab a different guy with 3rd line potential. Its not like its hard to find a 3rd liner, the Leafs roster is full of them"
597099,siwash,2011-06-27 10:06:00,683,"Leafs did well... Rick Dudley was a superb move, btw... he assembled the black hawks cup winning team...  The picks are always a crapshoot.. cannot judge for another 2 to 4 years."
597266,Grimace,2011-06-27 17:44:00,2020,I agree.  I hope Nugent-Hopkins has a son that marries girl named Wilson-Smith and decide to keep all names.  Nugent-Hopkins-Wilson-Smith.  I hope everybody does the same thing and everybody has 20 last names.
