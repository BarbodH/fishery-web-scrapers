The hi-vis line is a benefit to you, but can also allow the fish to detect the offering as well. What you may need to do is attach a shot-line (by the means of a swivel or uni-knot of around 12""-14"") and then attach a leader (about 18""-24""). I've recently switched to Stren (moss green colour) and that removed the need to use a shot line.  The more things you have on your line, the more chances of a break off when fighting a fish. Like they say, ""less is more"" in this situation."
