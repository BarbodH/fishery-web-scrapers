595610,CanadianShark,2011-06-23 02:46:00,13,Hey OFNERS   I am looking at the live target lures and thinking they would be a nice addition my arsenal of lures  I would love to hear your input regarding the lures and if they are worth the buck   Thanks
595622,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-23 03:24:00,4399,"Let ya know next week, I don`t usually fall prey to the fad of the day but dang that crawfish crankbait looked so cool and the top water frogs looked awesome aswell."
595624,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-23 03:28:00,1107,I've caught a bunch of pike ans OOS smallies on the medium 8-9' diver perch.
595635,guitardude_15,2011-06-23 04:14:00,16,"The live target smelt hammered walleye and smallies for me on LOTW, I don't know if it outfished the ghost x-rap it replaced though ?"
595636,hawk-eye,2011-06-23 04:20:00,141,"I love my perch bait, produced a lot of pike last year. Can't wait to try my new frog this weekend."
595637,adempsey,2011-06-23 04:25:00,1498,"If you do decide to pick some up, believe it or not, the cheapest place I have seen them for sale in the GTA is at Canadian Tire for $11.99.   Although, Le Baron carries the full line now, but I forget what they were charging."
595638,Bassnbows,2011-06-23 04:28:00,58,"Better get some, they've been working on Sturgeon for Pics. and Muskie. The only problem is that everyone will have them on the water this year by how there pushing them out there. Good Luck"
595672,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-23 12:32:00,4399,search livetarget you`ll get lots of reading.
595678,Steve,2011-06-23 12:55:00,2075,lets see...live target lures:  * paint chips/flakes off * eyes fall off * do not run true at slow speeds (less than 2mph) * cheap hooks and split rings (just try using one for salmon - you'll see) * their topwater frogs - just try and determine what brand of hooks they are using.  great stuff for $14+ dollars a pop.
595694,CanadianShark,2011-06-23 13:53:00,13,Hey guys thanks  there seem to be some mixed reviews regarding the live target lures  Has anyone used there crawdad lure
595753,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-23 16:37:00,4399,"Yes seems to be about 50/50 if they are worth the extra coin and if they really catch anymore fish than a regular crankbait or topwater,I am on holiday next week and plan on giving them a good go at Muskoka,Couch,Simcoe,Balsam and Dalrymple stay tuned!!!"
595755,troutologist,2011-06-23 16:41:00,951,"Same comment I've made on this topic a number of times. If you're not using the golden shiner through the ice, you're not catching as many walleye as you could, the pitch of the rattle really makes it unique, though the Lindy Darter has the loudest rattles I've used yet.  Nothing but great experiences with Live Targets, really like the deep diving smelt patterns for 'eyes."
595792,bassmaster4,2011-06-23 18:04:00,801,ive had great success on the perch lure medium size 3-5' for pike as well as the pumpkinseed 3-4' lots of pike and oos smallies and largies so far cant wait to use these up in gowganda next week
596042,coreyhkh,2011-06-24 02:00:00,163,"I got the perch one a few weeks ago, they look awesome but I have not got a single fish, I always go back to my tried and true Xraps. I fish they had better action.  I also picked up the frog this bait is awesome and I have had a few misses on this bait."
596061,Paudash,2011-06-24 02:35:00,273,"Great luck with the small perch bait for bass last year large and small, The smelt works great for pike, and I can't to try that new frog Saturday"
596072,Grimace,2011-06-24 02:43:00,2020,"A 2 pound largemouth destroyed the hooks on one of my perch baits.  A 3 pound largemouth destroyed the hooks on the other.   Pretty sad.   You know, with their hard mouths and pointy teeth.  Nice looking baits.  I have not experienced the paint flake.  I HAVE experienced the spam.   Some of the more aggressive spam since the slammer spam.  That is saying something too, not much can live up to that.

596292,bucktail,2011-06-24 16:15:00,1857,"I have ahd issues with them not being tuned out of the package, no biggie but if your paying a premium price you shouldnt have to do this. There pretty good, picked up the bluegill wakebait....the colours on it are horrid so its going to go under the air brush for some modifications."
596296,mike rousseau,2011-06-24 16:25:00,4661,Two thumbs down on the perch baits... Way to expensive and the rapalas outfished them big time...  2 rods using rapalas got 12 walleye 1 rod with live target perch... 1 walleye...
597690,addy79,2011-06-28 19:44:00,573,"just picked up the Live Taget Sun Fish, swims down 5' to 6'.  Looks AWESOME! I think most lure manufacturers market to fisherman, not fish, guess well see this weekend. I've never used a sunfish patterend bait so really curious as to how it performs."
597691,addy79,2011-06-28 19:51:00,573, LOL wait a minute...how does one market to a fish?? you know what i mean!
597703,Roy,2011-06-28 20:33:00,13728,The owner/manufacturer of Live Target is a member here and is online most mornings early. I'm curious to see if he will post to this thread. It'd be appreciated I'm sure.
597708,canada414,2011-06-28 20:45:00,40,I fished the Live target Shad and it works great for Pike. No real problems.
597714,jedimaster,2011-06-28 20:50:00,3472,"I tried the new Live Target Frog on the opener for Bass, and I did get 4 strikes. 1 fish took it under water. I set the hook hard with a 7'6"" Heavy action PT Tour with 65 pound braid and the fish only got halfway to the boat. The action ontop of the water was not as good as i was used to seeing compared to other frogs. It also sits almost vertical in the water, and makes it look kinda weird when you stop it. I used a walk the dog technique, a slow retrieze and a jerk bait type movement. I found the jerkbait movement provided the best action and is te only movement that got hits. I will be leaving te live target in the tackle box next tournament. "
597781,newboykool,2011-06-28 23:33:00,81,friend of mine had a lot of success with the crayfish crank bait but they are a bit expensive >.>
