It will let you search for lakes by name, location, or target species of fish.  It also has an ""Essential"" section. Some of the highlights of this area are a fish ID guide and a fishing regulations section (links to MNR website PDFs). It also has a solar / lunar calendar and a bunch of info on fish like knots, cleaning fish, etc.  It looks like a great app for someone who is new to fishing."
