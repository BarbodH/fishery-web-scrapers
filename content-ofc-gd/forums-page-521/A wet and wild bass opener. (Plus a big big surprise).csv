596700,BillM,2011-06-26 00:38:00,17367,"Rain or shine the oldman and I were getting out for bass opener.  We usually fair ok and today was no exception.  Day started off with a few nice largies and more surfacing gar pike then I've ever seen before!  I've made a mental note to bring the flyrod out next time and give these suckers a go..  Frank was the lucky one to land the big bass of the day a nice 3-4lber..   As always we pretty much fish topwater exclusively, today it was definitely the ticket.  Overcast, rainy and a bit of wind had the fish turned on for sure.    Here's the big big surprise   And people have trouble catching topwater pike?    Just under 40inches on the tape.  A few quick pics and back she went.  "

596710,misfish,2011-06-26 00:46:00,29133,"Thats some good fish,n there Bill.Congrats to your pop. We had down pours from Orrilla all the way up and never stopped.Not a happy fisher guy.Atleast time was spent with family.  TFS"
596713,Handlebarz,2011-06-26 00:48:00,3790,Nice Gator sounds like everyone had some water for opener
596714,Terry,2011-06-26 00:49:00,14456,nice fish your dad got there
596715,BillM,2011-06-26 00:49:00,17367," Yeah man, the rain just wouldn't quit today, then the wind picked up!  Tomorrow will be better though"
596717,Joey,2011-06-26 00:51:00,9122,"Wow, those are some great fish.  That's a sweet pike for sure, well done"
596739,NAW,2011-06-26 01:34:00,4022,"Great job Bill!  Fancy lookin tiller you got there. Can't say I've even seen a bilge pump in a tiller, if that's what all the plumbing is.."
596740,spinnerdoc,2011-06-26 01:36:00,556,cool catch Bill for your pop. A little off topic but what kind of leader would you be using if you go after the gars on the fly? i've heard the often get away bec they tend to cut off the lines when they roll over and their long snout does not help.
596776,lakerguy,2011-06-26 02:40:00,224,Nice
596784,BillM,2011-06-26 03:28:00,17367," Thanks man, and that's exactly what all that plumbing is.  With a raised floor there is zero room to scoop out any water.   My buddy has told me 30lb mono or Dacron will work fine."
596785,spinnerdoc,2011-06-26 03:39:00,556,I like that route instead of steel leaders
596797,Roy,2011-06-26 04:38:00,13728,"Great pics, Bill. An awesome outing with your Dad. Nicely coloured pike too! Some beauty fish and super memories for you both. Well done!"

596819,solopaddler,2011-06-26 12:15:00,8605,"Right on bud, nice fish. I'm guessing Frank's shoulder is okay now the way he's hoisting that pike."
596842,mercman,2011-06-26 13:55:00,7054,"Well done Bill !!!! Thats one huge bass, and a monster gator Memories to share for a long time to come.  Paul"

596987,MJL,2011-06-27 00:35:00,2427,Oh sweet Jesus! That pike is huge!  Nicely done
597013,muskymike,2011-06-27 01:30:00,772,"Awesome job Bill.  One question though, how come all of your reports show other people with fish and never you???"
597017,BillM,2011-06-27 01:38:00,17367," LOL!!!  If you want good pics, you've gotta take them yourself."
