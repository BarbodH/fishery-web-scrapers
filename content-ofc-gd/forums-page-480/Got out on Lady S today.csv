It was an AMAZING October day!  Who would have thought it, getting a nice tan on Thanksgiving Weekend.  Hear are a few pics from today.  Most perch were between 6-8"", with a few 10"" and 1 12"".  Just enough for a nice feed of perch. Ps.  The only reason I kept any of the smaller ones, is because they were going to dye from deep hooks.   Thanks,  Lovetofish         "
