629340,Familyfisherman,2011-10-10 11:15:00,188,"Some nice stuff there Steve.  I have a question on late summer/fall transitions for bass on Simcoe.  What is it that begins to make the fish move from 8-12 feet around weedlines out to suspend in 20-30 fow, and then to eventually sit on the bottom in 30-50 fow when it gets really cold?  Are they following baitfish, or changing feeding patterns or what?  I'm beginning to learn what they do, I just don't know why they do it...glad for anyone's input.  Thanks!  Tatoo looks...ah, painful"
