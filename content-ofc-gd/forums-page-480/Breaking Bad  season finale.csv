628987,darsky,2011-10-08 20:45:00,586,I am not normally a tv freak but since Lost ended Breaking Bad has picked up all the slack. I heard tomorrow will have viewers screaming at the tv from the edge of their seat.
628988,The JAY,2011-10-08 20:48:00,239,I can't freakin wait!!!!
628995,adolson,2011-10-08 21:26:00,783,Hope this finale makes up for rest of the lackluster season...
629022,BillM,2011-10-08 23:11:00,17367, You're kidding right?  This season has been awesome!
629025,fishindude,2011-10-08 23:30:00,220, Exactly! x2!!
629038,adolson,2011-10-09 00:40:00,783," Not if you watched the first three.  It's been so slow, soooooo slooooooooooowwwww. Unlike the other seasons. I debated not even watching anymore, but it's only redeemed itself in the past couple episodes. At least it's done that, unlike Weeds, which has steadily tumbled downhill since Agrestic burned.. This is my last season of that trash, that's for sure. I'll miss Andy, though. And Shane.  Y'all oughtta be watching Sons of Anarchy, too, though I haven't started this season yet (Kurt Sutter has yet to disappoint me, though)."
629067,BillM,2011-10-09 01:49:00,17367,I'm a huge SOA fan as well
629068,misfish,2011-10-09 01:53:00,29133,Is this that drug making /dealing show?
629073,BillM,2011-10-09 02:17:00,17367,"  Yeah..  Highscool chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer, realizes that he doesn't make enough $$$ to save for his family to live on once he passes away, decides to do what he's good at (chemistry) and starts to cook meth..  Such a great series."
629266,crossover,2011-10-09 23:27:00,172,"Hell yeah. I heard that they might be splitting the 5th (and final) season over two years, which would suck."
