628837,GYPSY400,2011-10-08 04:17:00,191," The purpose of warming the engine up before draining the oil is so: 1) the oil is warm and drains faster 2) the oil picks up the ""sludge"" and ""sediments"" and gets it out of the engine. Oil is designed to collect and suspend the dirt within it. By draining the oil cold, you are basically leaving the dirt inside the engine ( especially the metallic particles) I always drain oil when the engine is at operating temperature, always have, always will.  Also, oil filters have check valves built into them so they Don't ""drain out"".. This prevents the engine from dry starts.. So once it has run once the oil stays in the filter."
628840,irishfield,2011-10-08 04:22:00,26272," Cut one open sometime and reassure yourself of that... Some do.. some don't.. and what most think is a check valve is actually a BYPASS valve.. just in case the filter ever clogs solid. Upright mounted filters on Mercs, or at least the ones I've worked on, do not and they are designed to drain (and why Merc manuals tell you to let the motor sit for one hour before removing filter).  Have you ever cut a filter open... stretched all them pleats out and run your fingers thru it?? ... if not you're missing the most important part of the oil change!  Also if warming the oil up would ""pick up sludge and sediment"".. there wouldn't be sludge and sediment as it would already be in the filter from normal engine running."
628841,GYPSY400,2011-10-08 04:32:00,191," Well I won't argue that point, if that's what the manual says, then I would follow the manual..  I'm a licensed Diesel mechanic so I'm not too educated on the specifics of marine 4 strokes. I would still drain the oil hot though! Just let it drain for an hour!!"
628842,GYPSY400,2011-10-08 04:42:00,191,"And by Sludge and sediment, what I'm referring to is all the dirt within the oil that is too small for the filter to catch..  Warm oil picks it up and carries it out.  Cold oil - the sludge is sitting on the bottom of the oil pan.  But as I said before, if the manual has a specific procedure for changing oil, the by all means do as they say! An engine is an engine, but they are all designed a little different. And I agree with filters having a By-pass.. Most good filters have this feature. I may have been incorrect in saying the ""filter"" has the check valve, when it may be the engine itself having the check valve to hold the oil in the filter.. This feature is common on engines with filters orientated horizontally to prevent the oil from draining back all the way to the pan."
628847,Tybo,2011-10-08 06:03:00,1373,"A half clogged filter,filters better then a new one.  Wayne: Sometimes I like to put 600 volts to them too.  So I guess it's an engine in a electric car."
628858,Billy Bob,2011-10-08 10:03:00,5865,I have never worked on a 4 stroke outboard so my experience there is NADA...but have never ever changed oil on a vehicle that I haven't run to operating temps first......that's the way I was taught back in the '70's...hot/warm oil flows better and carries out sludge better that way.
628859,Billy Bob,2011-10-08 10:23:00,5865," Actually, I purchase those photos on the internet....  ...lot cheaper then actually going fishing...."
628881,mercman,2011-10-08 13:56:00,7054," Thats what i figured Anything to save a buck.  I have always ran a quart of new oil through the motor on my cars, before replaceing the drain plug. I may do the same with my outboard.Its a bit of waste, i know, but i feel it removes alot of the so called sludge from the oil pan."
628899,Fisherman,2011-10-08 15:29:00,7201,"If you ran a good synthetic like Amsoil with a premium filter, you wouldn't get any sludge.  I pulled the oilpan off my old 78 Rabbit at 12 years and 240 thousand, no sludge.  No sludge under the valve cover either. And by premium filter, I don't mean the ones that start with the letter F and sound like a dodge truck."
628903,Tybo,2011-10-08 16:09:00,1373,"Are engines at work get roll ins done about ones a year.There is very little and talking little sludge in the oil pan.This is because the oil now days is very clean. Also there is same amount of sludge in the pan hot or cold. The hot thing is to get you to change the oil as soon as it comes in.So the company can get more done.Good ploy. Dropping oil pans for 30 years I have seen the changes in oil first hand. If the maintenance is done a the proper schedule the viscosity of the oil is still high, holding most contamination suspended."
629129,wallyboss,2011-10-09 15:02:00,1095,"Got this from somebody and never again will have a oily mess after changing my motor oil on my 75hp Merc 4 stroke.  Go to the store  Get 1/4 inch drain plug, one end threaded other end open, about $1.25 at Princess Auto  Get 2 or 3 feet of 1/4 tubing also about $5 at Princess auto  Get a gear clamp, about 25 cents anywhere  assemble  Trim motor up and to the side  Remove drain plug  Screw in new assembly  Drain  Works like a charm and zero mess"
629608,Jen,2011-10-11 04:09:00,833,"I am curious as to why no one here has mentioned the use of an oil pump to remove the oil before you actually take off the drain plug, it certainly saves the mess!"
628550,mercman,2011-10-07 02:44:00,7054,"There is a large ""screw/bolt"" on the left side,looking at the back of the motor,  half way between the head and lower unit.Is this the drain plug for the motor oil? Just want to be sure,before i start taking things off"
628551,irishfield,2011-10-07 02:45:00,26272,"Hey Paul.. what does it say in that shiny black booklet with Mercury on it in Red, that came with your boat??"
628553,Roy,2011-10-07 02:46:00,13728,"Yes it is but ummm wear a raincoat.  And before you start, make sure you're equipped to remove the filter. Assuming you're replacing the filter."
628554,mercman,2011-10-07 02:49:00,7054," If i could find it, d'ya think i'd be asking here, knowing that you were still awake Wayne???"
628555,mercman,2011-10-07 02:52:00,7054,  Messy Eh? Maybe put some sawdust down first i guess. Messy is my middle name Roy.
628556,mike rousseau,2011-10-07 02:55:00,4661,Make sure you have a large drip pan... The oil goes everywhere...  Get a new filter...  Roll of paper towel...  And try to run the motor to get it warm fist... You can use the muffs and hose... Let it idle for 5-10 minutes...
628557,irishfield,2011-10-07 03:02:00,26272,The idea is to drain as much old dirty oil out before refilling and installing a new filter. Why on earth would you run the motor first and sling the old dirty stuff back onto motor parts and fill the filter? The motor should sit for at least an hour if it's been run.. so the filter will drain out and save a lot of mess when removing it. It's gonna be 23+C tomorrow... no need to warm it up.
628564,Tybo,2011-10-07 04:01:00,1373,The only engine I get to change cold oil in is my outboard.I guess thats why I look forward to it.
628576,Whitespinnerbait,2011-10-07 09:15:00,2038, It says if you don't know where the drain plug is .............its best to take it to a dealer for any maintenance required  :whistling:
628579,mercman,2011-10-07 10:48:00,7054,"  might just do that, rather than end up basted in oil.I have to find the manual, then it should be fine. But thanks for the input"
628580,bushart,2011-10-07 10:53:00,2628,Trim your motor up just a bit---have a drip pan  Pull that plug---a stream of dirty oil will spurt a good distance---pull pan towards motor as stream gets shorter---kinda like you know  That small trim up allows the plug to face down a bit more--when you pull motor over---if you don't---oil will just run down the foot of your motor.
628584,Roy,2011-10-07 11:25:00,13728,"Paul, just wait 'til it's warmer out. Get yourself a wide container to catch the old oil..put some paper towel under the oil filter...get a good sized funnel with a goose neck hose..tilt the motor to maximum 'gravity' and steer it hard to port for the oil to escape...undo the oil drain plug..let all of the old oil drain from the motor...undo the oil filter and discard...install new filter just a touch more than hand tight...refill with recommended oil...clean everything up and check for leaks...check oil level. If you need any of the items ie. tub, funnel, filter wrench..just pop by and pick it up."
628599,skeeter,2011-10-07 12:38:00,1907," Why did you have to go and take ALL the FUN out of it Roy. I was going to tell him to run a live feed on the board with his web cam so we could direct him. After we were finished laughing at him doing his funky chicken dance covered in oil.  Now my suggestion is: Paul, since Roy has all the right equipment and experience, just take the boat over to his place and have him show you the proper way. While your on route to his place, stop and get the oil,filter,gear lube and a new set of plugs. Keep the old plugs on the boat just in-case you ever need them. Remember to KEEP all receipts for warranty! ( But dont keep them with your owners manual!!!!!)"
628622,bigbuck,2011-10-07 13:34:00,2449,"You've got a 4 stroke, I don't think you'll be needing to be changing the plugs on it after 1 season. I'd check the manual though. Are you going to fog?? Make sure you get the right gear lube for your motor and correct grade of motor oil. You should run the motor for a few minutes to get any junk that has accumulated on the bottom of the oil pan to suspend in the oil so when you drain it, it comes out. It's a new motor so I don't think sludge is much of a concern but that is the way we were taught in Auto Shop back in the '80s and it still holds true for changing oil in motors today. Have plenty of sawdust handy and Good Luck!!!"
628627,darsky,2011-10-07 13:52:00,586,do 2 strk have these oil filters too??? Of late I have only been draining the old and refilling with new. And there is this talk about oil flying everywhere. Mine just sloooooooooooowly oozes out.
628640,Roy,2011-10-07 15:01:00,13728,No oil filter on yours Darren. You might be referring to the lower unit lube?
628648,dave524,2011-10-07 15:26:00,4508,Isn't it easier to just add 500 ml. of oil to a 25 litre jerry can when you fill up
628716,K_F,2011-10-07 18:47:00,107,"my 20 4-stroke has a nut halfway down on the drivers side you leave it vertical drain all the oil, then tilt it up and continue draining im pretty sure anyways  its laid out in the manual"
628720,mercman,2011-10-07 19:04:00,7054,"  Thanks K_F, thats the problem, i kinda misplaced the maual. I'm sure it will turnip before i put the boat away for the winter."
628736,northernboy,2011-10-07 20:23:00,13,"Having the twin of that motor, yes the oil does tend to make a bit of a mess.  Tiling it is what i have found works, about halfway up.  And yes, it is the large bolt halfway down on the left side (standing behind the motor looking at it).  Stop at the Merc dealer and get the socket for the oil filter, made by Merc.  The filter is extremely difficult to get off if not using the socket. In your manual (if you had it) it would tell you to run 20w40 oil as the regular oil in the motor.  If you need more info, or a scan of the pertinent parts of the manual, pm me and I will scan it for you when I am at home.  Trevor"
