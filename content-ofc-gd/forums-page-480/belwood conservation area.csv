I don't have a boat, but i would really like to hook into some bass/pike/walleye. Would i be best off using jigheads with minnows/worms to catch the fish, or would lures (spinnerbaits, crankbaits) work? Any feedback would help me out a lot!  Thanks in advance  - Matt"
628839,GYPSY400,2011-10-08 04:21:00,191,Last time I went fishing there in the fall the lake was gone!! I felt kinda foolish showing up at the launch with my BMT only to see a creek.   Appairently they let the dam out...  But that was a few years back so things may have changed.
628844,northernpike56,2011-10-08 05:19:00,717,"Oh, I forgot about that... It is low now as well. Would I have better chances going to puslinch lake or guelph lake? I wouldent mind hooking into some crappies and perch as well"

629494,canada414,2011-10-10 23:29:00,40,Don't go to Puslinch without a boat. The whole shore is private cottages except for a water skiing lessons shop. NO shore access except for the small lake called little lake connected north but that's really just a glorified pond
