629464,SlowPoke,2011-10-10 22:36:00,2984,Nice Mike! It was so nice today I was tempted to get the boat out of storage. I didn't. Maybe next weekend. LOL

629592,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 02:58:00,5784,You picked a great weekend to take a break and the bass picked a great weekend to put the feedbag on
629631,Handlebarz,2011-10-11 09:54:00,3790,Nice choice Mike I made the same choice and ended up cutting the lawn in the dark at 8pm the other night it did not look to bad and I did not step in any unsuspecting dog logs.
