628058,oldphart,2011-10-05 16:20:00,665,"~~~Head over to Roaches Point, and drop shot the 50' range, or a little south of that to a shelf of 18' dropping to 25', or the shoal just east of Jackson in 33' there's so many spots out there, try looking for the Terns diving on the water after bait phish, and you'll find the Perch underneath them"

(Side note) I won't be in any of these spots, I'll be heading out deep to 60' off George working my way in shallow to 39' looking for the Jumbos, well away from the Armada"

Basically followed the crowds fishing in 27 ft....lots of 10"" fish with a few Jumbos mixed in. Slowed down around 2:00 so went looking for them. Found them on a flat in 36ft....non stop the rest of the day. Hoping to get out a few more times before the hard water..  Take care and tight lines!"
