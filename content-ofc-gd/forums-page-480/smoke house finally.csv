629438,skinny,2011-10-10 20:34:00,442,well way back in the spring I asked questions on building  smoke house. My brother and I have it ready to go sort of . this house is gas fired and we tried to use a pot switch that topped out at 180 but we have found the swing to be to great. the house will go up to 240 or so inside before the pot shuts off the burrner then it will almost drop off the thermometer before starting. we have a few other options in the works but here is some pictures

629447,Bill Shearer,2011-10-10 21:31:00,456,"IMO, 240 is too high, but you can deal with it over time. It all comes down to heat units/time. You will find that the thickness of the fillets, and the species being smoked will dictate the time. Also the available oxygen to turn the wood to smoke will have a determination as well. Be aware that opening the door can produce a vapour rich to vapour lean possibility, that at the least can singe the eyebrows. The worst is much more painful. Be careful, test the process, enjoy the results. A good smoker can bring a lot of beer to your door!"
629457,skinny,2011-10-10 22:07:00,442,we have already located a digital control and  thermocouple so we should be able to narrow the swing alot.  we also have to swap the door hinge side as a hind site it's hard to hold for pilot to lite due to the swing on door
