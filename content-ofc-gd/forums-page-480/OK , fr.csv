628874,Roy,2011-10-08 13:00:00,13728,Big box for sure. Fifteen pounds of perch filets is a big bag also eh? The first two fish are the same fish...musta mixed up the pictures.
628875,Skipper D,2011-10-08 13:09:00,1970,"  Look again Roy ..lol. the fish should be differant unless i did make a miss take in posting them , 15 pounds of perch filets is my PB . We have more pic's to show if this old computer will stay running .....lol."
628876,Skipper D,2011-10-08 13:18:00,1970,  The proof is in the fish dish........lol
628878,Roy,2011-10-08 13:40:00,13728,"A great catch there Skipper. But yes, the first two are the same fish. Congrats."
628898,Sinker,2011-10-08 15:29:00,8692,"Nice catch, but they don't look like fillets to me.  I was wondering how many perch fillets it would take to make 15lbs. I know its a lot more than 100 perch worth!!  S."
628900,Billy Bob,2011-10-08 15:33:00,5865," Not when they are JUMBO Lake Erie perch...the perch we caught yesterday on Erie we long, fat and WIDE bodied....they are getting huge eating gobies....but if caught in the spring time, they are weigh even more but the fillets are THIN as most of their energy goes into the eggs."
628925,misfish,2011-10-08 17:32:00,29133,Think I see some bass tails there?  Too many bones for this guy.  TFS Skip.
628926,Terry,2011-10-08 17:32:00,14456,they look like good size perch you were into  nice fishing report
628944,Skipper D,2011-10-08 18:40:00,1970,"  We had 83 in all when finishing the day , proably put that many back ."
628946,Skipper D,2011-10-08 18:44:00,1970,  Thanks  Terry .... might try to show the filets if i can keep this old computer running .....
628948,lew,2011-10-08 18:48:00,12766,Good to hear the day went so well for you guys Skipper.  Can't beat a day on the water with your brother !!
628958,Roy,2011-10-08 19:15:00,13728," I'll often just leave them whole. Carefully placed blade will take all the meat off leaving all the bones intact. Either way, some great meals."
628979,Skipper D,2011-10-08 20:31:00,1970,"  That i would like to learn Roy , after cleaning and skinning we place them in the fridge for and hour or so before doing fillets, makes for easy cutting that way when the meat is firm ."
628981,NAW,2011-10-08 20:35:00,4022,Decent meal there skip..  Back at er again tomorrow I take it?
628982,Skipper D,2011-10-08 20:37:00,1970,"  Thats right Lew , i did feel good to have him with me out there , also gave me the chance to take care of his fifith birthday blue's this week end as well .....lol."
628983,misfish,2011-10-08 20:40:00,29133,Pepsi?  LOL  Now theres a plate of fish I can chow down on.

628992,Skipper D,2011-10-08 21:21:00,1970,"I mention  its my brothers fifth birthday today , heres a pic of what i bought him , it should keep him pacified when the fish are'nt biting ... right ...lol."
628997,Billy Bob,2011-10-08 21:29:00,5865, I hate to say it but that's one ugly kindergarten kid...
628999,Skipper D,2011-10-08 21:32:00,1970,Heres what you get when you cross a Townsend fish skinner with a electric can opener and a sewing machine foot peddle....We thank La La for this one .
629101,Skipper D,2011-10-09 11:14:00,1970,"Bouy the sun rise took its time this morning , so much for early any more .

628359,Rod Caster,2011-10-06 15:32:00,5784,First was the pre-pre-report. Now we have the pre-report.  Still gets more hits than my actual report... Maybe he's onto something
628365,Terry,2011-10-06 15:54:00,14456, yeah I feel the same way....
628369,bucktail,2011-10-06 16:01:00,1857,"Waiting for the report! I am fish vicariously thru you this weekend, dont let me down! LOL"
628379,NAW,2011-10-06 17:23:00,4022," Don't forget the post between pre report, and pre pre report.  The plea for help to save the stranded fisherman near bellville.  The little bruder i'm assuming.."
