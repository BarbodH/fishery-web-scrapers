629198,scugpg,2011-10-09 18:53:00,1373,"Hey guys I have a 50hp Merc carburated 4 stroke and it seems to run rough at idle sometimes and occasionally stall out. Trolling around 3-5mph it sometimes misses. Running 2000rpm and above it runs great and seems to run better after going WOT for a little while.  Changed the fuel filter, plugs, ran a bunch of seafoam through it this year. Runs better after plug change but still happens consistently.  I also notice that the fuel bulb doesn't stay stiff on this motor...I've heard that this can be typical on these models but not sure.  Has a built in fuel tank and put in a new fuel bulb this year.  What else could be causing the issue? I know it was sitting quite a bit last year so hoping there isn't a bunch of water in the tank under the floor. Would be a real pain to pull the floor up. Any ideas?  Thanks!"
629245,bushart,2011-10-09 22:20:00,2628,I've got the same motor  You may have the Ethanol blues---a degraded piece of crap in your carbs  Took mine to a merc dealer who blew out the ports and reset the carbs--sorry hate to be the bearer of bad news  PS I have the tiller so mines better
629251,scugpg,2011-10-09 22:45:00,1373,I have the tiller too  Maybe I'll drain the carbs and add more sea foam.  Do you have issues with the fuel bulb on that motor?
629265,bushart,2011-10-09 23:24:00,2628,The primer bulb on mine will get stiff---did you get the ethanol free bulb----no kiddin
629271,scugpg,2011-10-09 23:38:00,1373,It's an attwood ethanol resistant one....the old one did the same thing so thinking it's not the bulb
629276,Tybo,2011-10-09 23:58:00,1373,If it's a older engine.Replace all rubber fuel lines will ethanol suitable.
629290,Pigeontroller,2011-10-10 01:03:00,2793,"Yep, fuel lines or carbs..."
629443,scugpg,2011-10-10 21:22:00,1373,Did some troubleshooting today and it looks like something above the bulb causing it to lose prime. Where the fuel pump is I can hear hissing when I prime. It doesn't leak or seem like it's a gasket so maybe the pump check valve?
629449,Garnet,2011-10-10 21:41:00,2056,"Dish soap and water. Spray hoses, connections. Look for bubbles."
629451,scugpg,2011-10-10 21:48:00,1373," Good point! I tightened the in/out connections at the fuel pump but could still hear hissing. It honestly sounded like it was from inside the housing but will give that a try its got to be somewhere.  FYI on the fuel bulb, it will prime solid but go down a minute or two after priming....whether starting it or not."
