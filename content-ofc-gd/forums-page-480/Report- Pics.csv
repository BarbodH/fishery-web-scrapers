628904,TDunn,2011-10-08 16:13:00,680,"Hey OFC!  Its been an extremely busy summer and I have had some major computer problems over the last few weeks. This is my excuse for not posting a report for sometime!  Anyways, I'm not to sure where I left off but I think I had posted some atlantics last. The bite was fast and furious during early season and as the baitfish kept coming in the bite was getting tougher and tougher. No shortage of fish but with so much food present, some days were difficult. The last few outing were good but the size decreased. Fish ranged from 2-5 pounds.  Lots of these   Bonus eye while casting for atlantics Video Walleye on the upper river    After I rapped up my atlantic season, I spent time kayak fishing Lake Superior Provincial Park. Fishing is incrediable on good days and great on bad ones on this lake. I spent a weekend with my cousin and his dog there. I think we landed 30+ lakers and half a dozen specks between the 2 of us on this trip.                      Laker video  We did portage to another lake one afternoon. Fishing wasn't as hot so we didn't stay long.       I returned back myself for a marathon, one day adventure. Left the Soo at 5am and returned around midnight but well worth it. Landed 19 lakers and one brookie on this day.            Fished Lake George a couple times. Usually trolling cranks or bottom bouncers on boards. Mixed bag of smallies, walleye, pike, drum and perch.               Didn't get out for salmon very much but I did fish the Salmon slam which is a 5 day event. On day 2 I landed a 15.8 pound chinook which kept me on the leader board until day 4. I was bumped a couple places out by the end.  Most fish were landed and released boatside       2 chromers for the smoker       Went up the 129 (Chapleau hwy) looking for some walleye and smallies on grouse opening weekend. Didn't see any birds that day but we did find the fish!     walleye were taking bottom bouncer and spinner/worm combos   Bass were taken on cranks and topwater           Next up was brookies in the Elliot Lake area for a day trip before the season closed. We caught a ton of smaller fish in the 12-14"" range but we were searching for 20"" + fish. We had our chances and seen two fish that were 5+ pounds swimming around the boat swiping at our lures but couldn't hook them.     lots of these guys    Best fish of the day   Ive been hititng the rapids every now and then after work for the last hour or so of light. Getting the majority of my fish bouncing or floating roe. Couple videos  Walleye Release  Landing a Salmon  Pink Release  Last wekeend I was in Southern Ontario fishing the final stop of the Ontario Kayak Fish Series (OKFS). It was a one day event and considering the weather the tourny had a descent turnout. Fishing was tough to say the least but I managed to put one of the three bites I had in the boat which was good enough to tie for 5th. I had a great time and hopefully I can fish 2-3 stops in the series next year.           My cousin just got back from his first summer up at a fishing lodge. He was lucky enough to get on with marmac Lodge. Thought I would post a few highlights of his summer.              Hope you enjoyed!   TDunn"

I remember a day after doing a day trip in early June into a lake that starts with an M at the Northern arm of this lake. The weather was hot and sweaty. When we got back I was like eff it I'm going to dive in of this very dock in the picture. I don't think my gonads have ever hit my brain pan so hard. Dam your water stays so cold up there.
