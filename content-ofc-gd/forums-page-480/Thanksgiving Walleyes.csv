629705,Jigs,2011-10-11 14:44:00,136,"Hey guys,  I got out on Saturday and yesterday and the fishing was absolutely amazing. Not only was the weather July-esque but the fish were on both in numbers and size. We caught a number of fish and most were above 3lbs, with a few beasts in between.  A bit slower yesterday but things picked up nicely around 5pm.  Thought I'd share a few pics this morning. Hope everyone enjoyed their Thanksgiving weekend!  All fish were released.               This was one of the smaller fish. I almost kept it for dinner but didn't feel like filleting.     And last but not least...  The big one from last night. 8.4lbs on the Rapala digital scale.    "
629708,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 14:51:00,4661,Nice fish dude...  Still trolling or getting vertical?
629710,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 14:54:00,5784,
629711,Jigs,2011-10-11 14:54:00,136,I tried a bit of both. The jigging worked better in the middle of the day a bit deeper and when that tapered I trolled again up higher. The bigger ones were on the troll.  Really had to slow down to a crawl though. And had a lot of fish hit but not stick.
629715,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 14:57:00,4661,"I hate getting ""bumped"""
629718,Jigs,2011-10-11 14:58:00,136,Yeah it seemed to happen a lot. More than in the summer. It's especially frustrating when you know there's a good chance that fish is 3-4-5+.
629728,mercman,2011-10-11 15:19:00,7054,Awesome fish Andre !!!Save a couple for me.I'll be heading up that with with Mike and my brother in a couple weeks.Maybe see you on the water too  Paul  
629730,Jigs,2011-10-11 15:35:00,136," Thanks Paul!   They're all still there I put 'em back! They'll just keep getting fatter now.  Hope you guys get nice weather (and big fish, but I'm sure you will). A lot of people put their boats away it was like vacationing up north this weekend out there. Should be even better in a few weeks. Just beautiful. See you out there!"
629735,fishindevil,2011-10-11 15:52:00,6254,awesome size walleyes man well done !!!!
629745,Carp,2011-10-11 16:18:00,1488,Sweet !  Thanks for the report and pics.
629757,coreyhkh,2011-10-11 16:46:00,163,Awesome fish how fast do you troll the slowest I can go is 3.5 or 4 km is that to fast.
629758,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 16:47:00,4661, Yup
629778,Jigs,2011-10-11 17:27:00,136, Yeah you want to slow it down more than that at this time of year. Try shifting in and out of neutral.
629789,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 17:52:00,4661,  You can also trim up your motor... This also will slow you down
629808,msp,2011-10-11 19:21:00,1336,Awsome report with some big fish and great pics
629819,Roy,2011-10-11 20:00:00,13728,Very nice fish indeed! So nice and clean too! No marks on them...the muskies must have been looking the other way.  Thanks for sharing.
