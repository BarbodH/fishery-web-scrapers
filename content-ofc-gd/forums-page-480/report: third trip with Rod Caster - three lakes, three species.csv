629574,adolson,2011-10-11 01:59:00,783,"So, finally, today was a nice day with little wind, in contrast to the previous two days of the weekend where I caught nothing and  So we troll around the stocked laker lake, and not even a bite after around 3 hours or so. At this point, we thought we wouldn't get our three species... Not off to a good start.  So we headed off to a brookie lake, the same one I went to last week. Within minutes, we had bites and he landed the first one of the day:    We putted around the little lake, casting into shore. I had lots of bites, missed a big one early on, and several others throughout the day. We even saw a few of them attacking the lures, including a reeeeally nice male that I wished I had hooked into. Even from where we were sitting, it looked pretty. I was sad.  To cheer me up, he decided to show me a magic trick...   TA-DA!!!!!   He caught the second one, and the biggest I've seen from here so far.  We weren't at the lake for long, as we had an appointment with our walleye lake and a third fishing partner, but the minutes turned to hours as I sat there, without a brookie for my plate. Finally, I got one. The pic doesn't really do it justice. It was 11 inches, as big as my biggest the first time. Not as big as either of Chad's, but boy was I happy to finally catch something this weekend!    About 4:30ish, I spot one jump near where I had hooked and lost one last time I was here. I cast over to it, hook into it, and lose it a few seconds later. Bah! Oh well, we're off in a hurry to meet up with a third partner at the third lake.   Somehow I beat Chad and his dad there, and thought this was all some elaborate plan for him to steal my lifejacket and hard foam/brick canoe seat... After checking out the lake and seeing I was alone, I drove back to the main road and there they are, waiting for me... lol  By now the sun is getting low.. We pack in quick and get in the water as fast as we can and paddle off to our spot. The bite was decent, but not great like the previous two times. We still pulled in probably 18-20 fish between the three of us, and we each took a couple home. We only took a handful of pictures, and some are blurry because it was getting dark and I didn't flip the flash up. Oh well.          The biggest one of the night, the other half of a double-header withe one of my keeper-sized walleye. It was a tad over 17"" so it had to go back.   The sun went down, and we occasionally pulled up a fish here and there. It died off, and after Chad pulled up a rock bass, we had our trifecta. We paddled back to shore and headed off.  Thanks for the invite again! Even though you wouldn't trade my walleye for your specks..."
629576,irishfield,2011-10-11 02:02:00,26272,Great stuff guys!
629580,Roy,2011-10-11 02:14:00,13728,"Magic trick eh?  Great report, glad you had a good time."
629584,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 02:28:00,5784,Thanks for the great company again Dana! I had a blast today and soothed my fishing addiction until tomorrow. I didn't know I was a fishin magician. Hahaha
629612,highdrifter,2011-10-11 05:05:00,2534,Nice grand slam dude!
629616,spincast,2011-10-11 09:05:00,3279,no better way to spend a day - nice going.
629657,Musky or Specks,2011-10-11 12:26:00,2710,To bad McNab didn't produce. They stock the snot out of it. Good job otherwise.
629659,johnnyb,2011-10-11 12:34:00,3413,Lovin' these reports....good job guys!
629665,Rod Caster,2011-10-11 12:46:00,5784," Super clear water in that lake and beautiful scenery too. We trolled in 30-50fow with harnesses and spoons and made at least 5 runs across the lake. We found some nice channels and drop offs and worked those areas even harder... I'm thinking the bright clear weather was a factor in their tight-lipedness today. Also, neither Dana and I are seasoned laker fishermen haha.  Do you think they'd be closer to surface this time of year? Would they be more scattered or schooled up? Thx!"
629675,mike rousseau,2011-10-11 13:07:00,4661,Sweet day fellas...  18-20 walleye is good... Just gotta find the bigger ones...lol
629679,Musky or Specks,2011-10-11 13:20:00,2710,I'm guessing schooled up getting ready to waste their reproductive abilities. I'd look for shoal boulders in 15 to 25 feet of water I don't think there is an inflow there also try just off were the hatchery truck dumps them off as fingerlings. Hatchery fish will gather were they were first planted in the lake at spawning time.
