629165,MJL,2011-10-09 16:45:00,2427,Sweet fishy Brian  Yesterday I was doing some steelhead sampling in your neck of the woods. I have to admit that even those small bows do fight well for their size.
629167,misfish,2011-10-09 16:58:00,29133,"Thanks guys   You should of said something.  It,s only going to get better.We have to hook up soon.  How did ya make out?"

629257,northernpike56,2011-10-09 23:01:00,717,sweet fish man!   you were using pink berkely worms? I never knew you could catch a steelhead with them! Do you just put them on a plain hook under a bobber? I have yet to catch a big steelhead like that guy but really want to get a few this winter
629269,BillM,2011-10-09 23:31:00,17367,"Brian, gotta work on that gill hold   I realize they are slippery buggers, get yourself a cotton glove or similar.  Makes it a lot easier to hold on to them."
629270,misfish,2011-10-09 23:36:00,29133, I just hook the plate Bill.Never touch the gills.It swam away just as healthy as it was never caught.I hear ya. I have seen your pics along with others from here. Will do. Thanks.
629277,Joey,2011-10-09 23:59:00,9122,That's awesome Brian.  She's a beaut
629280,ccmtcanada,2011-10-10 00:12:00,7971,"You can't help it if they head to a log jam, but I was once told if you aren't re-tying because of snags drifting in waters like that, you aren't doing it right lol.  I look forward to more steelhead reports from you Brian!"
