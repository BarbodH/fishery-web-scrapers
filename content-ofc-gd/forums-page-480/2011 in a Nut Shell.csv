My family, only dad missing    been 3 years already    Then came my daughter's bowling tournaments and they were successful in winning the provincial    and get to the National    Daughter's personal best!!!    Me playing.... Raising money for the National    Back to fishing... later in the season, switched lake.... and got into this            My daughter being a model at school... love you sweetie    Later on... Got into a whitie    Then came the injury   OUCH!!!  Burnt hand and fingers with hot wax    Had an icy spring trout opener... managed one    Sugar bush is always a treat.... random pics        The garden and deck.... random pics                        Then came a great looking laker    Mom moved to a retirement home and she was quite happy in that pic!!!    Random shots inside            Me.... Brake time      Over looking to the North      Daughter getting her prize.... end of bowling season!!!      Summer came around and got into a nice whitie    Daughter and team in Saskatchewan for the National    Got Hector out of the way and relocated to a safer environment    Then it was my birthday in July      Then my wife's birthday in July    Family weekend - random pics              "
628846,Leecher,2011-10-08 05:54:00,7832,Daughter's braces came off.... the before and after      Great family time with Jean Marc Parent the humorist        Came fall and haven't gone fishing much since late July but was quite happy to harvest the apples in great numbers!!!      Found a great apple sauce recipe!!!    Some shots that my wife took of the sun effect    This is my favorite    That's about all for now.... Hope you enjoyed!!! Leechman
