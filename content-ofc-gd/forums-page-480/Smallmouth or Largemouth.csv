628754,nroadrunner,2011-10-07 22:11:00,113,smallie.  I have caught at least 10 like this from a small lake I fish that has both species.  I find the smallies I catch around the weeds look like this.  The ones of the rocks in the lake look normal.    Ian
628763,Dutch,2011-10-07 22:48:00,831,"Too bad the dorsal fin isn't up, SM the fin is solid, LM the fin is separated.  Not a hybrid, very unlikely, but not impossible.  They spawn at different times and have beds in different types of water."
628778,Whitespinnerbait,2011-10-07 23:47:00,2038,Largie......or Photoshopped !!
628779,Leecher,2011-10-08 00:11:00,7832,No Photoshop in this one.... It's a smallie no questions ask... Doesn't have any different characteristics that leads me to believe it's a largie... even with the color pattern but I'm no expert so don't take my word for it
628780,northernpike56,2011-10-08 00:13:00,717,smaller mouth and you can kind of see the vertical bars. Maybe a smallmouth that was living in dense weed cover? great fish btw
628790,hirk,2011-10-08 00:36:00,571,"Smallie for sure, the cheeks give it away. Green smallies are pretty common."
628791,Whitespinnerbait,2011-10-08 00:38:00,2038,"OK, time to get serious...100% Largemouth !!"
628795,adolson,2011-10-08 00:54:00,783,"I catch these all the time, they're known as the aurora trout."
628800,Terry,2011-10-08 01:02:00,14456,"<a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=fish2.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/fish2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
628803,Leecher,2011-10-08 01:07:00,7832, OK.... IT'S 100% SMAll MOUTH  
628826,steverowbotham,2011-10-08 02:36:00,1800,"I personally believe its a hybrid.  The jaw extends past the eye indicating largemouth, though it does have many smallmouth characteristics"
628834,Djeep,2011-10-08 04:06:00,199,"I've caught fat largemouth with a similar small mouth, but the lateral band was much more prominant. It could be a hybrid, a characteristic of hybrid species is to have a thicker body then either parent (as in tiger muskie). This fish appears to be pretty thick. I'll say hybrid just for fun."
629097,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 09:53:00,5865,100% for sure........it's a Black Bass.....throw it back....it taste like crap...
629493,johnnyb,2011-10-10 23:28:00,3413,  Hands down best reply  
629495,Mike the Pike,2011-10-10 23:30:00,3421,Smargie
628655,steverowbotham,2011-10-07 16:00:00,1800,Interesting catch here. A member of my club caught this fish in Cooks Bay a couple of weeks ago... What do you all think? 
628657,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-07 16:08:00,2690,"I would say Largie...but, almost looks like a cross-breed.  Took a second look...the head, how far the jaw extends in relation to the eye...definitely smallie. However the back half of the fish, sure looks like a largie."
628658,mike rousseau,2011-10-07 16:11:00,4661,Im going smallie with an odd color pattern...
628659,Roy,2011-10-07 16:13:00,13728,It's a smallie.
628662,Harrison,2011-10-07 16:17:00,2202,"For sure smallie, but wonder if it is a weed fish.  Hence the colouring.  It is from Cooks, so maybe so."
628664,Jigger,2011-10-07 16:23:00,1237,"I want to say smallie, but the mouth looks like it might be behind the eye and the rear end looks largie... Smargie?"
628665,Remastered,2011-10-07 16:23:00,143,Certainly a smallmouth. But the oddly patterned tail section gives the impression of a largemouth. Maybe it was a wannabe
628670,craigdritchie,2011-10-07 16:34:00,1586,Smallie. Fish from Scugog sometimes have similar colouration.
628673,bushart,2011-10-07 16:41:00,2628,I'm with Jigger  Hook in mouth behind eye says largie
628675,Harrison,2011-10-07 16:44:00,2202," Good point Craig, here are a couple green Scugog fish for reference.  Edit to add-  Sometimes the bars do not show up on smallies right away, this could be the case with the fish in question. "
628682,bushart,2011-10-07 16:55:00,2628,The scugog greenies have definete bars---definite smallies  Steve's fish has those lateral line markings at the tail end of a largie
628683,Live2fish85,2011-10-07 16:55:00,1633,I am going with smallie cause the head but it does look like a cross.
628684,Terry,2011-10-07 17:02:00,14456,looks like a Hybrid to me  they do happen
628686,Pikeslayer,2011-10-07 17:02:00,1443,I'm going with DINNER.  Slayer
628687,ra95,2011-10-07 17:04:00,49,Of course it is large mouth. The mouth is much larger than a smallie.
628688,mercman,2011-10-07 17:07:00,7054,"Big fat smallie. Color as per habitat.the ones i catch around here have no 'bars' either.Just green, but paler that yours.  "
628689,singingdog,2011-10-07 17:11:00,1047,"Tough call. The head certainly looks like a smallie, but I have never seen that pattern on a smallie before. Seems to me like a candidate for the hybrid category."
628694,GBW,2011-10-07 17:16:00,8460,Largie who's mouth isn't so big.  I think it has a complex and now you are all picking on it...
628695,Cookslav,2011-10-07 17:21:00,1457,No doubt in my mind...that there is an Atlantic
628698,fish_fishburn,2011-10-07 17:30:00,1311,Is there an orange ring in the eye...No. Cause it's a largie.
628702,Gregoire,2011-10-07 17:47:00,1397,"It looks a lot like a largie to me, but I would go with hybrid as it seems to have some traits identified with both species."
628709,[emailÂ protected],2011-10-07 18:11:00,97,Face/Off!!  I think it is a largie trying to pass off as a smallie..
628717,esoxansteel,2011-10-07 18:51:00,1307,Looks like diner for those new Simcoe Muskies
628725,johnnyb,2011-10-07 19:19:00,3413,Hybrid seems right...but if I had to pick one I'd say largie...jaw looks like it goes back far enough and everything else looks like a largie to me.  
628728,Roy,2011-10-07 19:37:00,13728,I think it would be very unlikely that a hybrid could happen although..we should never say never.
