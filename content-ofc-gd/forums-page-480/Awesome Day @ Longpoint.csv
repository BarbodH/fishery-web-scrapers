629110,The Urban Fisherman,2011-10-09 12:59:00,2050,"Hit up Long Point bay yesterday for some perch and pike action with the kids!  I've been quite busy and just have been a little down lately, and yesterday was just what I needed!  We hit the bay right before lunch, and were lucky enough to hang out and visit Shawn, Dan and family and even got to see Frank and Julie for a few minutes!  Averie's been wanting to catch her first pike on her own and managed connect with a couple yesterday but she didn't manage to land any.  Dan put us on some great perch fishing though so it was a good time had by all!  Big thanks to Dan, his wife, kids and his Mom who cooked us dinner and had us out at the cottage for the evening.  Averie and Luke had a great time and won't stop bugging me to go visit again!   I'll let the pix tell the rest of the story.  heading out     Averie's first time at the helm   Dan and Family   the essential minnow / fish bin   First fish of the day   Luke wouldn't hold his at first   Perch or Bass? lol   Movie Break   Some Keepers...       Luke passed out doing 24 MPH in bumpy water lol   Some scenery shots..     Kids playing back at the cottage...        Averie's new bud - Dan' boy     The little ones trying to play catch...   He get's his wit from his mom but he wasn't lucky enough to get her looks!   Averie went for a quick evening dip...   We enjoyed a great sunset...     They had a photo op on the quad..   Then it was time to say goodbye..     Thanks Dan - it was a day the kids and I won't soon forget!  Have a great thanksgiving everybody!  Cheers, Ryan"

629122,skinny,2011-10-09 14:15:00,442,Hey looks like my son and I missed you guys out there. we Launched from Post marine about same time as Frank and Julie. But then headed out to find another friend to find out he moved on. So we just hung out with the crowd of boats. we managed to hook about dozen keepers. Hung around abit then saw Frank and Julie (but wasn't sure it was them ) fished there area a bit then headed back in to toss some pink worms (my son is in search of a big fish but won't keep line in water). Saw Frank and Julie getting ready to pull the boat out and finally said hi.Then went and pulled mine just in time to meet up with Dan to find out we missed out on the on the water gathering . To bad for us but still great day. My boy wants to go today too
629126,irishfield,2011-10-09 14:51:00,26272,Can't beat a day like that guys! I see one of Dan's boys takes right after the old man...  
629128,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-09 15:00:00,1107,"Yeah it was a fun day, it's not often that I get out and just fish for fun like this .the hunt for trophy fish or tourney wins often takes the fun factor out of fishing and feeding the LPB perch and catching a few was alot of fun. Kaleb caught lots of small ones and I got us enough for a feed  and a hammer handle pike to toss into the mix for a good fish fry and Kaleb had a blast .Looking forward to hanging out again in search of some toothy critters in a couple weeks I never got the camera out while we were fishing so here's a pic from when we got home and the first time Kaleb has held a fish on his own he will kiss them but would never hold them      "
