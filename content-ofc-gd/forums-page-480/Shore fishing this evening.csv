The lake was like glass which usually results in slow to terrible fishing...but the bite was almost non stop for the one and a half hours i was there....lots of little walleye, a few decent keeper size and 2 or 3 18"" +.                            <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/HxhUnAkNbS4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
