629342,Big Cliff,2011-10-10 11:31:00,6899,"I have a large American Bass wood tree in my yard and I understand that it is an excellent wood for making baits. I have to take two large limbs off of it, one about 8"" in dia and about 12' long the other about 5"" in dia. and about 6' long. Anyone interested in the wood for making baits? Free to a good home!"
