Had the decoys packed up, and taking pictures as the sun was cresting over the trees.  The best morning of water-fowling I've ever had.  What a perfect way to start the long weekend.  Pike fishing tomorrow, then back at the ducks Monday.      "
628924,misfish,2011-10-08 17:28:00,29133,Nice harvest there bud.  Some good eats.

629092,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 08:58:00,5865,"Anyone can have a great day of duck hunting in the zoo....  GREAT DAY of waterfowl hunting....like I said before, those are BAD BAD Birds and must be punished and shot before sun down....and you did your job....well done......I'M JEALOUS !  !  !  Our season doesn't even open until Oct 22nd.....I did pull a roam permit but in a area I don't know very well.....might go scouting tomorrow if the winds are up and I can't fish Lake Erie for perch.  So tell me more.....I'm guessing on a Lake/River with all the Blue Bills....what's your favorite load...#2's or 3's ??? This year I will be trying some Black Cloud but the Kent's have been very good to me in the past.  Bob"
629111,NAW,2011-10-09 13:00:00,4022,"I use the cheapest Federal shells I can find.  #4 2-3/4"".  We're hunting a big marsh, with our permanent blind built right in the middle.  Only way in is by canoe.  It makes it a little bit of an adventure each morning, but it keeps the crowds down.  Only seen one other hunter there all year so far.  I've tried the black cloud, and didn't see the point in spending extra bucks.. It costs twice as much as what I'm using."
629119,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 14:02:00,5865,"I use to use the cheap Winchester Xpert loads until someone told me to open one up and see the crap they use for shot....different sizes, many not round...basic crap....that's when I switched to Kent's... I got a box of Black Cloud for only $14.99 so I had to purchase them...I can remember using GOOD LEAD shot magnum loads for only $3-$4 per box...  Good Luck on your season, Bob"
629121,dave524,2011-10-09 14:13:00,4508,"Nice bag of birds, look again though , think there's at least a few Ringnecks in there."
629134,NAW,2011-10-09 15:15:00,4022,"I wasn't sure if they where ring necks of young blue bills.  What ever they where, they tasted good"
629148,dave524,2011-10-09 15:55:00,4508," For future reference, Ringnecks should have been called Ringbills  I can see the white ring around the bill in about half the birds. That with the fact that you were hunting in a marsh rather than more open water and it is still pretty early to have Bluebills/Scaup down in any numbers, plus now that you say they tasted great... Ringnecks are a better bird on the table IMHO, I bet that they were all Ringnecks. Great day in the marsh anyway"
629177,Sinker,2011-10-09 17:11:00,8692,"Yep, they're all ringers! Except the mallard of course.......3 guys I assume??  Good shootin! Ringers are my favourite duck over the decoys. When they want in, there is no stopping them!! I haven't shot one yet this year, but have got into the bills pretty good!!  FYI, a ringer will have grey/olive feathers on the tops of its wings, a bluebill will be white. If there is any white on the tops of the wings, they are bills. Those are all ringers for sure.  S."
629191,Familyfisherman,2011-10-09 18:09:00,188,Nice work Nick -- and on the house sale also!  Congrats!  Fall bass are about to arrive...
629426,NAW,2011-10-10 18:59:00,4022," Thanks for the tips on Bird ID.  I'm still a bit of a green horn when it comes to ID.   Thanks Sinker.  Hoepfully you get into the ringers soon.  They where loving the decoy spread that day..  Taking shots at them , missing, and they'd come around again even closer the second time..  Crazy birds.   Thanks Kev! The house was on the market Tuesday, and got 2 offers before the weekend.  Sold for asking price..  Let me know if you need a bass fishing partner one day this month.  It's going to be very busy with the big move, but I'm sure I could pass up a morning in the duck blind for a little bass fishing."
