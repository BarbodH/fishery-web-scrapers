Like to pick up another if some one had one on here that they wanted to sell rather then buying a new one"
629010,Terry,2011-10-08 22:19:00,14456,you can buy a new transducer
629019,lew,2011-10-08 22:57:00,12766,"Skipper, I've got a spare transducer & cable your welcome to if it'll fit your sonar.  It's off a Lowrance X-510C and the tag on the cable says HST-WSBL wide angle.  If it's compatible with your unit, and all you need is the transducer and cable, lemme know.    "
629029,Handlebarz,2011-10-08 23:46:00,3790,If they dont work call Angling Outfitters they have a bunch of 520c units for $300 not sure if its just the power head but they also have many different transducers.
629033,Skipper D,2011-10-09 00:17:00,1970,"  Ibetter buy a computer to , the thing just came back on . sorry . Where abouts Terry , minds just a cheaper humming bird i belive ."
629034,Skipper D,2011-10-09 00:22:00,1970,"  Thank a million there Lew , yours looks pretty big , the ends on mind are the size of a phone jack but i keep them in mind tho . Never know what i''l find before i'am done with this ........ Ron"
629035,Fisherman,2011-10-09 00:25:00,7201,"How much wire is left on the transducer end?  Someone with a bit of soldering skills can get that back together again.  I shortened my transducer cable quite a few years ago, still works and no ill effects from shortening the cable."
629039,Skipper D,2011-10-09 00:40:00,1970,"  The cable is fine , not cut or any thing like that , it took a couple of real good hits on the transducer before it landed , i belive its the transducer thats pooched ."
629055,Fisherman,2011-10-09 01:12:00,7201,"Ah, okay, understood."
629095,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 09:35:00,5865,"Skipper, that the best thing that could of happened to you.....now you can get a real fish finder.....Lowrance makes the best units and depending on what your budget is, you have many to choose from."
629098,Skipper D,2011-10-09 10:32:00,1970,"  If it comes down to that , buying a new one , i'll have to look into them ."
629142,NBR,2011-10-09 15:47:00,163,Call a Lawrance dealer. They probably have transducers in stock. Before I went to a TM with a built in transducer it seems I had to buy a new transducer every year or so. Banged too many rocks. When I came up to your loverly province I always had a replace4ment in the boat.
629233,Billy Bob,2011-10-09 20:58:00,5865,Pretty sure Lowrance will not have a Humminbird transducer in stock...
629234,Terry,2011-10-09 21:18:00,14456, find the make and model and these guys should a the transducer you need  http://radioworld.ca/index.php?byman=true&man=125&c_path=3
