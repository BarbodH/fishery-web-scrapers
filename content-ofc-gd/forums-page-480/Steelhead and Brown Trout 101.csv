628277,The JAY,2011-10-06 03:11:00,239,"Man, there is so much to learn! I've caught these on YouTube before, and learned a lot, but after trying some things out on the Grand in Caledonia (with no luck) I was going to go back and re-watch them. Thanks for putting them all in one place for me to find! Got a trip up to Bayfield planned in 2 weeks, maybe I'll have some better luck there. Thanks again!"

628570,Sawyer,2011-10-07 05:14:00,48,"Fish_finder,  I wish you posted this thread 2 years ago when I started fly fishing.  It's always refreshing to see experienced anglers sharing their insights on the sport.  -Sawyer"
628785,SirCranksalot,2011-10-08 00:25:00,3291,"I have done some fly fishing for specks and a little for Atlantic salmon. The 'terminal tackle' , and therfore the casting technique, is quite different from what's shown on the video clips. For specks and Atlantics flies are used to try to get the fish to rise to the fly, rather than bringing the fly to the fish as shown. Given the limits that the sinkers and float put on the casting technique when using a fly rod, would it maybe be better to use the fly, sinkers and float with a float reel or spinning reel?thx"
629085,Swan_Dive,2011-10-09 04:01:00,46,"  Casting a weighted rig compared to just a dry fly or nymph is completely different but that is the beauty about fly fishing is that you never stop learning.  There is so many different casting techniques to learn and they were all formed because people had to adapt to different situations.  When your casting a weighted rig you are not doing your standard false cast because you would end up either hooking yourself or knocking yourself out.  If you are interested in learning how to cast a weighted rig or different techniques for different situations, I would suggest searching it on youtube.  Youtube has helped me a ton because there are a ton of casting videos on there to help you out.  Also like Fishfinder said, head down to the speyclave and talk to the instructors down there, you will be surprised what you can learn in just a few hours.  Swany"
