I cruised the lake looking for fish on the depthfinder but I only picked up one or two fish all day Iam just wondering is there a secret to catch fish in the fall? I am thinking of hiring a guide one of these days to help lol.  also Lake Muskoka is very clear now does that mean its turned over?  Anyway thinak's guys Happy fishing"

629281,msp,2011-10-10 00:14:00,1336,Try hitting points and rocky shorelines. Drive around the lake and hit every point that sticks out. Use jerk baits and spinnerbaits and work them fast and irratic. Keep a tube jig or a grub rod handy and ready to throw back at the fish that follow. Always watch behind and under your lure for followers.
