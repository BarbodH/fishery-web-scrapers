This spring I hit up a local lake about 2x a week for a good month and a half. A lot of success catching decent pike and my girlfriend and I each caught a hefty largemouth each!   Keep in mind, the inflatable in the pictures is my only form of boat, so bigger lakes are definitely out of the question!  So I have heard some stories about Mounstberg (being a resevoir and all) and the water levels being ridiculously low. I have only fished Guelph lake once, but had no idea what I was doing and a front just pushed through. Never fished Puslinch, and me and the girl had a blast fishing Deer Creek (albeit the fishing was tough) during the fish-a-thon for a cure. Another option could be Binbrook....   What are your opinions? Thanks a lot!"
