With the upcoming weather forecast I knew today would be an excellent opportunity to get out and lay a beating on them.  My day started at 8 am with getting out a bed to meet RL42 who had purchased my old steelhead rod and was coming from London to pick it up. Rob it was nice to meet you and I hope someday we can meet up for some fishing. Maybe I'll show you my musky spots on your home water.  Hopped in the car and went to pick up timmies for the house and got home and started to make breakfast for everyone. Cheesy eggs,Bacon and English Muffins. Leisurely breakfast and watching Friday night PVR of Blue Bloods(Great Show)behind us we get our gear together and talked about what we should do.  Finally we get to the river and walk to our spot wetting our lines by about 1:30 which was my plan from the start as I wanted to give the sun a chance to get those sunfish moving.  Its such an incredible joy for me to watch the happiness on my son's face as he lands the first fish of the day. The size doesn't matter to him or I, you can tell he's really Jonesing for fishing again and that warms me heart.    Like I figured the fish were schooled up in here and had the feed bag on. Its soooo awesome when a plan comes to fruition.  Da fish                                He beat me in numbers but I did manage the biggest a 19 inch oinker      A couple of very short videos taken with my camera so the quality is kind of lacking  http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePdsharpe#p/a/u/1/B4Igqp82_uk  http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePdsharpe#p/a/u/0/IKLU7hsW9xg  We definitely saved our best day of fishing for last. While he goes out to his girlfriends for thanksgiving dinner with her I just might sneak out on my own tomorrow Everyone has got to take advantage of this weather.  Fish were all caught on Yum tubes or Yamato worms"

629308,crappieperchhunter,2011-10-10 02:44:00,2582,Love to see this stuff   I'm happy your son has rediscovered fishing. I know how good those days on the water are.  I'm hoping to get my daughter out for some fall perching in the next month. We haven't done that together for awhile.    Thx for sharing that  :thumbsup_anim:
629312,adolson,2011-10-10 03:23:00,783,"Wow, you done good today! The patterns on them bass look real nice.  I did terrible today, caught nothing, lost a brand new lure to rock snags. But then, I wasn't fishing at the part of the river that I wanted to be fishing at."
629323,limeyangler,2011-10-10 04:03:00,5204,That looks like fun!  Being up close and personal up to yer @!#$@ in water....lol...only way to go!
629527,Leecher,2011-10-11 00:29:00,7832,"Doesn't get much better than that Great father / son report, pics and bronze back Thanks for sharing Leechman"
629670,johnnyb,2011-10-11 12:54:00,3413,Simply fantastic....hope that my son gets back into it in the next few years...thanks for sharing that
629671,Musky or Specks,2011-10-11 12:57:00,2710,"I bet he will. I wasn't sure my son would and it only took about three years and he's even more hooked than he was as a child,although girlfriend is still his #1 priority"
629672,johnnyb,2011-10-11 12:59:00,3413,Well that gives me some hope.  I KNOW I overdid it when he was younger...now he's 11...I just play it cool and let him come with me when he decides he wants to.
629681,mirogak,2011-10-11 13:23:00,387,"Great pics, report and fishing - never knew those tubes could be that effective. I hardly use'em for bass.  Question for you Brad, after using a tube for a day or so's fishing, it looses that oil/scent that they come with in the package, but can you still keep it and reuse it in the future?"
629683,Musky or Specks,2011-10-11 13:27:00,2710,They are salt impregnated. So even though the salt on the outside washes off when the fish picks it up it still taste real.
