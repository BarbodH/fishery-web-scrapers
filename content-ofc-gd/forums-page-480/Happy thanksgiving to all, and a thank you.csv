I recently found out that my dear sweat sister in law was diagnosed for cancer  She is way too young to deal with this type of cancer. Dealing with mild treatments on biweekly increments, and what im going through. No thanksgiving this year for the first time in my life, for all of us. Theres always next year and her health is more important than a turkey diner. Have a great long weekend folks, and be greatful for what you have in your life.   "

629077,Miracon,2011-10-09 03:09:00,200,"It's just a meal and an excuse for a day off!  Family is more then that! And you get to choose what days become Special to you, and celebrate those instead!  Forget the significance of the weekend and take everything one step at a time now. It sounds like she is an amazing person and that's all it takes to have HOPE on your side!  Who gives a rat's ass what Thanksgiving is anymore! Make your own Thanksgiving and make it count! That will mean more to your whole family then a date on a calendar!  All the best wishes are sent to you and your family!"
