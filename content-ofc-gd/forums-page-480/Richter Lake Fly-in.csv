620867,Leecher,2011-09-13 01:30:00,7832,Awesome trip Rob I bet you're already planing your return Thanks for sharing Jacques
620881,Joey,2011-09-13 01:44:00,9122,"Excellent report, looks like a great time and some awesome fishing.  That one shirt must really be lucky eh     One more wash and it's game over for that one"
620954,trapshooter,2011-09-13 10:53:00,1234,Great recap Rob.  Had a lot of fun with everyone on this trip.  I'm glad your brother came along too... where's the rabbit picture?!?!
621119,Rod Caster,2011-09-13 17:55:00,5784,"A few of the sunset shots were really captivating. Nice haul of pike/walleye.... can't believe you managed a top water hit, but there was a photo so I do.  "
621142,Grimace,2011-09-13 18:41:00,2020,It sure looks like an awesome trip.  Looks like a great part of the Earth.
621575,walleye wanderer,2011-09-14 23:29:00,64," Hey 3 cheers for Craig aka Billy Bob Thorton, he shared our week at Beteau and he was great! He even came out fishing with us for a day and caught some real fine Pike. The combination of Eddie and Craig made us feel like we were at a resort rather than a fly-in camp."
621862,Abraxus,2011-09-15 20:12:00,104,"We were the group leaving when you were arriving.  We had a great time at Richter as well.  We must of caught in the neighborhood of thousand fish over the 7 days.  I personally had a day where I caught over 100 fish.  It was absolutely crazy. I have been meaning to do report of my own, but have not found the time.  Getting back into the work schedule has been taxing to say the least.  I am also waiting for one of guys in our group to send me the pictures that he took over the week as well.  Richter is a fish factory.  Non stop action all day long.  Even on a slow day, I would catch in the neighborhood of 50 fish.  The biggest pike we caught, came in at 36inches.  I had one slightly smaller at 33inches.  Good times and freaking great sunsets!  Ab"
625687,Baitchucker,2011-09-28 03:29:00,3,"Great right ups. The pictures are fantasic. Pleasure was all mine guys. Good times, new friends. Hope to see you all again. This summer will be one of the most memorable. Next year can I have a new title?  Cabin boy"
625693,limeyangler,2011-09-28 04:43:00,5204,hey...thats not fishing...thats CATCHING!  Great report KF.....topwater walleye...always wanted to try that.
625730,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-28 12:21:00,4399,"  Hi Craig how ya doing?  Did ya get that salmon? yet,I am going to be up in your area on Saturday to try and catch one off those half dead boots!"
625736,Moosebunk,2011-09-28 12:29:00,3970,"Was away when you posted this up.  Glad to have found it now.  Great pics, trip and time shared with your brother.  Enjoyed that, thanks."
626106,kickingfrog,2011-09-29 03:06:00,8333,"My brother worked on a poem while we were up there.  “Richter Lake”  Eddie’s stake at Richter Lake got us on a plane. “The Pike and Walleye ‘round these parts are literally insane. They’ll hit on every lure. They hit from dawn till dusk; ... They’ll even wack your favorite lure that’s seen its share of rust. I’ve built a cabin there, that I did well equip. A place to eat, a place to sleep, a place to take a crap.”  And so we packed our fishing gear and all our clothes & food. We wrapped our extra sweaters tight around our bottled booze. We fly over the lake now, the cabin lies beneath; A lonely, stoic monument that’s nestled ‘mongst the trees. The pilot circles twice and then he lands the plane out front. He puts it snugly to the dock, a most impressive stunt.  The time now is upon us. The mission is at hand, To target scaly fishes which are in the rocks and sand. Many fish are caught, far too many to keep track. We keep a feed of tasty “Eyes” and put all the pike back. One day leads to another, more meals of fish are had. I’m starting to sprout gills now but the thought of that aint bad.  The end now is upon us, we ate all that was left. As fishing goes this angler knows this lake owes us no debt. We pack our gear, the plane is near, our time has come to leave. Our “College Try”, our heads held high of that we did achieve. It’s back to civilization, back to our girls and wives. A piece of Richter Lake goes on with us in our lives.  ><> Jim Rice September 10, 2011 <><"

Weathers been to nice to cool the water to get them moving. Good rain forecast for the end of this week should cool the Nottawasaga down. Then it's good hunting until freeze up. Mmmmm......rainbow. I'll keep you posted. Maybe get you back up this way"

We had pike double headers and pike/walleye double headers           This lure was one of the more productive ones although after the third day I rarely used it.

620492,Skud,2011-09-12 03:24:00,739,Great to meet you guys before the flight out. How did you like flying out with my stinky bear carcass? Nice pics. The fishing was MUCH tougher at Beteau
620506,Terry,2011-09-12 09:06:00,14456,looks like a great trip
620507,spincast,2011-09-12 09:12:00,3279,sweet. looks like a great trip. thanks for sharing
620513,solopaddler,2011-09-12 09:50:00,8605,Nice Rob. So did the experience live up to your expectations?

620530,danbouck,2011-09-12 11:24:00,4380,Sweet pics!
620533,Roy,2011-09-12 11:46:00,13728,"Beauty report, Rob! That star shot is great. Glad you all had a good time. It'd be interesting to see what an underwater cam could pick up down there. Maybe the water is a little too stained for that?"
620540,corvette1,2011-09-12 11:59:00,1765,awesome trip guys congrats
620543,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-12 12:13:00,4399,It was a great trip the cast of characters made it memorable.  No worries about bear smell in the plane I think we did a pretty good job of masking it.  My son got some underwater video Roy but I have not seen it yet.  My report will be up a little later.  Well done Rob.
620549,TennesseeGuy,2011-09-12 12:22:00,957,Thanks for sharing your trip with us.  We're running out of time for 2011.  It's time to head up yonder.
620553,fishindevil,2011-09-12 12:33:00,6254,awesome trip for sure !!! great fishing & scenery
620556,adempsey,2011-09-12 12:36:00,1498,What a place....thanks for putting your report together.   Your nighttime shot reminds me that I will need to bring a nice telescope along with my fishing rods whenever I manage to get up there.  Cheers!
620572,johnnyb,2011-09-12 13:10:00,3413,x3 on the starshot....all the pics are great....some really nice walleye....MAN I wanna get up there!
620577,solopaddler,2011-09-12 13:19:00,8605,Looking at your pic's again it appears as though Gord managed a pretty decent pike.
620634,TJQ,2011-09-12 15:41:00,7806,AWESOME!! Ya gotta luv it when the fishing is THAT GOOD!!
620673,lakerguy,2011-09-12 17:34:00,224,"That looked like a cool trip guys  How was the water level?,where you able to fish the other water bodies above or below?"
620696,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-12 18:20:00,4399,"  Nope water was low,Craig our cabin boy(sorry Craig)   did manage to go up part ways to retrive a motor. I will talk a little more about Craig in my report later. The connection to the north may be doable with higher water."
620734,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-12 20:01:00,2690,"Some awesome photos, and, really decent fish.  Looks like a great destination Rob."
620741,lakerguy,2011-09-12 20:14:00,224,  Haha he was our cabin boy on Bateau lol  sorry Craig
620743,kickingfrog,2011-09-12 20:19:00,8333," Topwater walleye was one of my goals for the trip. I've heard of it, but not seen it first hand. The walleye were super aggressive, I really didn't use any traditional walleye lures and yet had no problems catching loads of them.   Good to meet you too. I never put the two together (that is was your bear on the plane) I got to fly up front but the other guys said there wasn't any smell.   My brother and I never got into the ""big"" pike (high 30s to low 40s) but that's fishing. Everything else was pretty much bang on."
620745,kickingfrog,2011-09-12 20:23:00,8333," Having Craig there was great. He would gas up the boats every day, cleaned some fish, stoked the wood stove, prepared the coffee at night and many other things as well."
