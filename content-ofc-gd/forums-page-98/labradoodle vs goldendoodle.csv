998250,verno,2017-03-27 23:56:00,178,"I will chime in with the experience we have had over the last year with our new pup.  She is a Pudelpointer.  Crossed around 1850's between a Wasser pudel and an English pointer.  We also have a 13 yr old Vizsla.  Contrasting the two, the PP is far more biddable and easy to train.  She can stand (and seems to prefer) harsher corrections.  By that I just mean that she doesn't shut down under pressure.  Used a prong collar twice, and she has been heeling ever since.  She just wants to know what is expected and she will repeat the behaviour after that.  The Vizsla needed a much softer hand, and while the training would take longer to accomplish, he had the same ability to retain his training.  The PP in the house is a dream.  She just chills out wherever the family is, outside she has just as much energy as the V did.  As a pup, the V was INSANE in the house and outside.  Tons of energy.  The V is short haired and sheds a TON.  It gets everywhere, but being short there are no tumbleweeds.  The PP has a wirey coat and doesnt shed, but does pick up WAY more burrs.  Ticks are easier to spot on the V.  We are already sold on getting another PP.  The caveat I would have to add about behaviour is that the V was my first versatile dog and a lot of the behaviour is likely my fault not his.  They are both crazy loyal and great with the kids. If you want to have a look at the PP I can make arrangements for you to see her.  Lacrosse season is coming up and we cross the city a ton in the spring."

She's always been fantastic with our 4 kids and their friends (or anyone who wants to pay attention to her), is a great swimmer and retriever, has a gentle mouth and loves being in the boat.  No regrets at all."
998634,Hoppy,2017-03-31 13:39:00,95,Our last dog (Dudley) was a lab/border. Wonderful! Super smart and easy to train. He had a huge vocabulary that kept growing into his senior years. We looked for another lab mix but in the end got a black lab puppy. Vader 15 months now and is a beautiful example of his breed and starting to be a well behaved companion.
997101,Rattletrap2,2017-03-15 23:49:00,1652,"There are two golden doodles in my neighborhood and neither of them are very intelligent. It could of course be the breeding.  As for purebred's, my golden is 14 1/2 years old and still in good health. We keep her trim at 62 pounds and never feed her human food.  As for Cancer, all of the dogs that I know of that contracted it all ate human food on a regular basis. Not a scientific study, just an observation on my part.  Good luck with your research. X2 I'm with you on this one! We only ever fed our Lab/Sheherd/ Border Collie cross dry dog food and never had a single health issue in almost 14 years. He was the smartest dog I have ever known. Our friends have always fed all there dogs human food and have a ton of health issues to go along with it."

997103,FloatnFly,2017-03-16 00:10:00,1640,"I am pretty sure that all breeds of dogs are considered to be the same species.  So a cross breed would not be considered to be a hybrid.  The first labradoodles were obviously bred by crossing a lab and a poodle.  But, now they could be bred by either breeding two labradoodles, or by breeding a lab and a poodle.  they are not purebreds, not by any stretch. its a designer dog breed.  yes, they can breed 2 crossbreeds together, otherwise known as an F2 hybrid.  breeding a lab to poodle is what most breeders do which is known as an F1 hybrid, while still unpredictable, can be more reliable. the pups are completely unpredictable characteristics.  when you breed two purebreds together, you pretty accurately predict what the pair will produce for pups.  bad health characteristics, looks, all can be bred out when using a purebred to purebred breeding"
997171,brkygetr,2017-03-16 21:54:00,425,"I will chime in on this one... I lived at a place that bred both Lab/Golden Doodles. Strictly bred with a papered stud (Standard Poodle) to the papered girl (won't use the proper word here). The dogs I were around were awesome...and I hung out with them in the backyard every day. However I had no experience with any late life Doodles as only one was kept as a pet. The place I was at was a very reputable breeder and looked after all health concerns and would simply not breed any dog to another if there was an outstanding health issue. I think the biggest problem, as was stated, is these dogs became a commercialized trendy dog  that everyone wanted to have for there non-allergenic traits, smarts and the classic family bonding of a Lab or Golden. This was back in 2004-07 when the demand was high and relatively new. Nowadays there are too many people looking for financial gain and possibly overlooking the true benefits that these dogs provide. Would I buy one? No. That being said I would take one from where I lived in  heartbeat. Just not going to pay for one. Reason being I like my Goldens as they are. (I'm not a big Lab guy). If I had to choose between the Lab/Golden/Poodle cross it would be the fury one unquestionably. Bottom line do your research. Ensure your breeder has been in the game for a long time and CARES about the dogs. ...also as mentioned the pounds have lots of companions waiting for a new home. One of the best dogs I have ever had came home that way one day and I do not regret it one bit."

My own idiot brother cages the Jack Russell for up to 10 hours a day in a Condo and has a kitty litter box. It has never seen a blade of grass.

There was always someone home to walk her and she wouldn't be locked up inside for more than a few hours. If for any reason we would be out we were lucky enough to have the In Laws close by to let her out. I was considering getting a Pup for the last few years. I know it would force me to get out for a walk everyday. But there are times I just can't walk more than 20 feet. So it wouldn't be fair to a pup who would run me ragged. I have started to lean in the direction of getting a pup since this thread started, it would force me to walk everyday, use it or lose it. So I'm thinking hard about it again as we don't travel like we did a few years back and it would be great for me physically and emotionally. The real problem is my wife is the Cat Lady, usually she has 2. Her Cat (that hates me by the way) is 11 years old and I don't think it would be too kind to a new puppy coming into it's space.

They started as minimum symptoms but after lab tests they became expensive to diagnose and treat. Realise that we treat our dogs like kids so the money we spent is not what some people will spend. We could have taken the easy road and keep them pain free for a year or two and then put them down. We had one had a lung removed and a jaw removed and rebuilt to give her a longer quality life. The other is going on some really expensive auto immune program that started out like it was a pulled neck muscle. Don't get me wrong this could happen to any dog since my Coon hound has not been inexpensive in himself. Most of the mixed breeds in my opinion are less prone to breed specific issues just from my informal investigations from the dogs I visit in life as a plumber. To note also only one of the dogs were purchased  the others where from the shelter or from our vet helping rehome them. I would say to contact your local shelter and tell them what personality of dog you want and have them call you when he comes in. I have had a few dogs in my life that breed wise should not be a water dog or good with kids but were never told, the case in point was a bulldog that loved water.   Art"
997084,John Bacon,2017-03-15 21:09:00,3277," Just curious, how are Labradoodles bred??? do they breed 2 Doodles together ? or do they breed a Lab and and Poodle together ? If I remember biology classes of long ago , hybrids might not breed true , some offspring reverting back to the parent species, you could get 4 pups, 1 Lab ,1 Poodle and 2 Doodles. I am pretty sure that all breeds of dogs are considered to be the same species.  So a cross breed would not be considered to be a hybrid.  The first labradoodles were obviously bred by crossing a lab and a poodle.  But, now they could be bred by either breeding two labradoodles, or by breeding a lab and a poodle."
997088,SmokestackLightnin,2017-03-15 21:17:00,390,"Our Labradoodle just turned 12 and she has been the best dog we have ever owned.  Her mother was a Chocolate Lab and her dad a Standard Poodle.  She is loyal, safe around kids, loves the water and we think she's pretty smart for a dog.  We have bells on our doors and she rings them when she wants out.  Would be very hard to get another dog after this one.   She is definitely now showing her age and I know that she likely doesn't have too many good years left.  No illnesses to treat. "
996965,FLEX ROD,2017-03-14 19:50:00,394,"Currently we have a 11 year old Cockapoo and he has been the best dog that I have been around, but he is getting up in years so I am contemplating getting a second dog.  With owning the Cockapoo I am sold 100% on the Poodle blend, hence  the labradoodle vs goldendoodle choice, we have recently bought new property with a lake 2 minutes walk ,  I really am looking for feed back about these two breeds, and these two breeds alone.  Once we have chosen the breed, I will look at seeing if I can find a dog that is up for adoption and or a rescue dog but I really need to hear any pro and cons of the two breeds so that I can start to look for the next member of the family.  Our current dog is definitely a part of the family who has the run of the house and he has 1/2 acre to play so obviously the new dog will be no different but I personally would like a bit bigger / hardier dog that is why I am looking at these two breeds and not another Cockapoo, otherwise I would not even think twice and would get another  Cockapoo at the drop of a hat.  Any and all info is greatly appriciated, as I think I know which way I am leaning but would really like to hear from this knowledgeable group.  Many thanks, FLEX"
996966,aplumma,2017-03-14 20:01:00,6896,Had 3 labradoodles in the family to date and they all have had issues mostly cancer and autoimmune variety. They have been expensive to keep healthy. These dogs came from national breeders with papers and excellent breeding practices. We will not be getting a 4th. A full blooded standard poodle is the next puppy on the farm You might want to check them out you would be surprised how outdoorsy they are.   Art
996969,FLEX ROD,2017-03-14 20:22:00,394,"This is why I love this site so much, thank you Art, this is exactly the type of feedback that I am looking for.  Art, have you heard about the same problems with the goldendoodle by any chance?  What is really funny, is that as I said that I had a dog that I was leaning to and yes it was the labradoodle.  ​Now I really do know that I have a lot more research to do.   Art, did your dogs develop the problems early on in life or did they appear later on in life? How old are or where your dogs?  Thank you very much, FLEX - John"

996974,John,2017-03-14 21:03:00,2956,"John, both flavours of ""Doodles"" have been bred over-extensively in Canada and the US. They were so popular when introduced that ethics and responsible breeding have since gone out of the window, at least with a lot of so called breeders. I have many friends who have Lab and Golden Retriever doodles and spend huge amounts of money on them. Not only purchase price but subsequent vet bills. Many have developed forms of cancers, skeletal and other diseases. Others have been difficult and in some cases almost impossible to train. The odd one overly aggressive.  Do yourself and a resident a favour, visit an animal shelter and choose a friend who needs you as much as you need them.  John"

X2,  my 2 girl friends both came from the Hamilton SPCA, Abby, the brown one is supposedly an Australian Shepherd according to the adoption papers and Elsa is listed as a Lab Mix but I suspect she may be a purebred "" Pitador "".

996980,grimsbylander,2017-03-14 22:47:00,3016,"^^^ This is a great plan as well. We looked for weeks trying to find a dog...Hamilton to St. Catharines and unfortunately each time we thought we had line on a dog, we would learn how it couldn't be around kids or other animals or the like. Too bad because we wanted to go that route as well. Sure glad we have this guy though."

996986,FloatnFly,2017-03-15 00:13:00,1640,"what ever breed you choose, make sure you do your research on possible health risks associated with that breed, for instance, labs are prone to certain health risks like cancer, just because of over breeding. i myself have a cross breed, border collie mixed with golden.  was an accidental breeding, dad got loose and found momma. hes a wonderful dog, full of energy, has the herding instinct, and has to know where everyone is in the house at all times. goldens also tend to act like puppies for the first 3 years, and then start to calm down.  cross breeds tend to live longer than purebreds.  a good friend of mine had a poodle,he used it for hunting and retrieving.  they aren't the french prissy dogs they are made out to be on TV.  he would have gotten another if he didn't discover the chessy, chesapeak bay retriever."

996991,Cast-Away,2017-03-15 00:52:00,790,"There are two golden doodles in my neighborhood and neither of them are very intelligent. It could of course be the breeding.  As for purebred's, my golden is 14 1/2 years old and still in good health. We keep her trim at 62 pounds and never feed her human food.  As for Cancer, all of the dogs that I know of that contracted it all ate human food on a regular basis. Not a scientific study, just an observation on my part.  Good luck with your research."

Border collie poodle mix. Aside from a few ear infections when he was a few years old, I've had zero problems with him. High energy, playful, awesome with kids, and loyal. Just offering a different option that I think would serve you just as well as the 2 other breeds."
