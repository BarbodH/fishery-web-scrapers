997969,lickmyarmpit,2017-03-25 13:23:00,359,Since I made the best decision of my life. Packed up and moved north.  Been a fairly steep learning curve on when and where to fish but we're starting to figure things out. Still got a good month of ice fishing left beginning of the season was tough with multiple skunks but starting to put some decent patterns together.  Here's some pics from the last year.
997976,crappieperchhunter,2017-03-25 15:00:00,2582,That's what it's all about right there....enjoying the great outdoors...in your backyard so to speak. Looks like you definitely made the right decision and thx for sharing.
997977,misfish,2017-03-25 15:08:00,29133,Looks like you made a great decision. Nothing like leaving the front door on a sled to go fishing.  Thanks for sharing.
997979,captpierre,2017-03-25 15:11:00,2521,Looks great! So how do you make a living up there?
