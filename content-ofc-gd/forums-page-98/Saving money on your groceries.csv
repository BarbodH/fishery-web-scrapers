You sir need to think about what you say... you seem to be quite oblivious to the actual facts of a dollar and maybe you need to realize some of what happens when companies forget that they need to change their prices when they should.. and if the consumer catches this mistake.. then the company needs to make the correct changes... there are better ways to support the economy and it is corporate greed that cause people to watch every penny they spend... same as some stores wanting to charge 5 cents for a bag after l spend $60.00 at their store and need 1 extra bag then l say well if you want to charge me 5 cents then i need to charge you 15 cents for me to advertise your store...

Yes, they are in business to make money. And when the corporation decides they will just let some worker go, to make up for the lost sales, that's fine. To me, if the cost of a product on only a few cents off, I let it go. If it's more, I bring it to the cashier's attention to get the correct price, and nobody lose.

998471,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-03-30 09:38:00,535,"In my mind, it all depends on whether you were paying cash or not and if the total came to $3.99. In that case, stores now round either up or down to the closest $0.05. If you buy something for $3.99 it's going to be rounded up to $4. There's no pennies anymore. At the same time, if it comes to $4.02 you'll get it for $4.00. Unless you're giving those pennies back, I'd say it's not very honest to complain about.  At the same time, if paying by debit or credit, there's no need to round up or down. So if it's automatically rounding all .99 items up to a dollar before even getting a total, yeah, that's a mistake by the store that should be fixed otherwise they're basically stealing from customers. A penny is just a penny but if they're getting it for several items over countless transactions a year, it will add up. Sounds like Office Space."

I sometimes find 3 or 4 out of 8 or 9 items that are priced wrong. At that rate you'd almost think they could save money by paying an employee to go around and do price checks on products.

More important is to know the regular list price of the products.  All too often the sale price is so much off the ""manufacturers suggested sale price"". , which is more than the actual retail price. You end up saving nothing."

Thats just chintzy. Gimme a break"
998185,Big Cliff,2017-03-27 16:34:00,6899,"A penny here, a dollar there.... I just went through my receipts and in the last month I have saved $67.32 by catching their errors. That might not seem like much to you but I work four hard hours+ to make that. If that average holds that would be $807.84 over a year. That is 50.5 extra hours I have to work in a year to pay for their mistakes.  You can call it chintzy if you want but if it puts an extra $800.00 a year in my pocket; well I've been called worse for a heck of a lot less."

998239,Garnet,2017-03-27 22:53:00,2056,I started growing bean sprouts more for fun than cost savings.  Turns out it's easy and likely very cheap. 1 cup of mung beans grows about 3 lb of sprouts. The cost about .70 and 5 minutes of time a few times per day.  This is way to much for us so I'm cutting down 1/2 cup.  If interested just you tube growing bean sprouts.

Alfalfa seeds are dead cheap. A tablespoon of seeds in a 500ml mason jar makes the same amount of sprouts as the container you get at the grocery store. Takes a week from seed to harvest. Toasted tomato and alfalfa sandwiches made with fresh from the garden tomatoes and our own sprouts....man I look forward to that every summer.

But we move into the new house in July and I can't wait to start growing again.  Bonus is the new house has wild raspberry and strawberries on the edge of the property!  When they dug the foundation, I asked the operator to pre dig for a garden too lol. Save Abit of work. At our new house, the back yard is gonna be 70% garden. The local park is across the street so I can utilize our yard for growing with worrying about the kids needing space.  So excited to move!!!!! 3800 sq.ft and a heated garage is gonna be so nice!"

And don't bother going out and spending money on seeds; A slice of tomato in a peat pot with a little potting soil under it and lightly covered in potting soil and lightly water it, you'll have all the tomato plants you need. Works for all kinds of other things too, almost anything that has seeds in it. Carrot tops can be rooted, potatoes....... Going to try the bean sprouts and alfalfa though"

I bought my 1st mung beans from bulk barn worked good. Then I found a Chinese market in Ajax and bought the package stuff same result.  Today is harvest day for soya bean sprouts. Tried bulk barn soya beans with poor results, these are much smaller soya beans from Chinese market look good."

997993,Big Cliff,2017-03-25 18:22:00,6899,"A couple of months ago I took over the grocery shopping duties (or at least a good portion of them), things were getting a little harder for Sue to manage especially when there were heavier items involved. We do a lot of our shopping in Loblaw's here in Lindsay because it is one of the biggest stores locally.  So one day I run in to pick up a couple of items, get to the cash, she rings them through and I pay for them. As I am walking away I think "" that doesn't add up, it should be less than that"" so I checked my receipt. Three of the 4 items I had just purchased scanned through at higher than the price on the shelf. I mentioned it to the cashier and she told me to go to customer service.  Customer service was wonderful, they confirmed that the items had scanned higher than the price on the shelf, gave me all three items for free. Apparently their policy is ""if an item scans higher than the indicated price they will refund the difference up to $10.00 per item"". In the case of  something like a multiple ie. 3 for $6.00 but they ring through at $2.49 ea they will give you the first one free and you only pay the proper price for the other two.  Almost every trip I make now I find something that saves me money, today it was Club House Tempura batter, price on shelf $2.99, scanned at $3.29, yup, got it for free.  The other day is was pickles; Price on shelf $2.99, at the end of the isle, same pickles 2/$6.00 (like that makes sense)  or $3.79 for one. Yup, one jar scanned at $3.79, got them for free.  I have also found CTC is wonderful for doing that sort of thing too so: You want to save money, PAY ATTENTION! "
997994,crappieperchhunter,2017-03-25 18:45:00,2582,LOL....Your turning into my father Cliff. He has been all over this for years....watching like a hawk when they ring his stuff through. Pretty much every time we chat he's sharing stories of the freebies he has got recently.

998030,Rattletrap2,2017-03-26 12:34:00,1652,"Cliff, unfortunately this happens all too much in my opinion. I think it is a game the stores play. Most people don't pay attention to iwhat the cashier rings in. TSC stores do this on a regular basis. I always catch them charging more than what the price on the shelf says! When Zellers was still around, I found the opposite. The price they would ring in at the cash was often LESS than the price on the item or shelf! Dumb though, because I often left stuff on the shelf when I thought I could get it cheaper elsewhere."
