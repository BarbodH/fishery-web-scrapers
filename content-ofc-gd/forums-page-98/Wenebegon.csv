998461,pike slayer,2017-03-30 02:30:00,1177,I'm going mid august so less bugs lol. He only has 1 other week available in July. It has to be booked up for a reason.
998586,chris.brock,2017-03-31 00:23:00,4053," Only one week available, that's a good sign.  I would try and contact some of the other guys who are booked. There's likely some groups that have been going to Wenebegon for many years and have gained some pretty good knowledge on the lake. Those Chapleau area lakes can be tricky for a first time venture.  PM me if you want some sites where the Wenebegon regulars might be lurking."
