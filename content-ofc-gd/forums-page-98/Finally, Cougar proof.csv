998337,misfish,2017-03-28 21:19:00,29133,"I still swear I seen one walking along the hwy heading to my parents place near Burks Falls. This thing was huge and stood out. I was driving in a group of cars and trucks, so pulling over quick was out of the question.  Today I heard that a cow moose and 3 calves were walking through the town of Waubaushene."
998350,chris.brock,2017-03-29 00:30:00,4053,"Thanks Jon, I contacted them, see what happens.  This has probably been posted before but it's a great study and hard to dispute.  https://2qhej2409oidqhffjfknkrvz-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/OMNR-study-confirming-presence-of-cougars-in-Ontario.pdf"
998646,Whitespinnerbait,2017-03-31 15:53:00,2038,Where are all the HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of Cougars that have been spotted over the years ????  Pics ???.....Tracks ???..... Dead corpses ?????   
998650,manitoubass2,2017-03-31 16:12:00,11391,Wandering the bush hunting?
998653,Whitespinnerbait,2017-03-31 16:21:00,2038,Any Proof of this ?...
998654,manitoubass2,2017-03-31 16:21:00,11391,No I don't work for the MNR or national geographic
998722,Weeds,2017-04-01 00:10:00,782,Surprising to hear about the moose hunting success. I've been hearing a fair bit lately about some significant declines in moose populations.
998723,manitoubass2,2017-04-01 00:16:00,11391,"Where are you though? Im in NW Ontario. We had a pretty wicked decline for sometime. It's still not ""where it once was"", but it sure as heck has improved.  Im not even sure what caused the decline??? Logging is probably one factor. Maybe disease???"
998745,singingdog,2017-04-01 11:39:00,1047,"What jumps out for me from that study is the 17000 camera nights, with no definitive photos of a cougar. And, in a 12 year study only 2 pieces of scat were recorded. I love the idea of a thriving population of cougars in Ontario, can't get past the lack of continued evidence of their presence."

998780,John Bacon,2017-04-01 18:03:00,3277,"What jumps out for me from that study is the 17000 camera nights, with no definitive photos of a cougar.  The area of Ontario is over 415,000 square miles.  17,000 camera nights is roughly equivalent of having one camera for an area of 25 square miles for one night."
998878,chris.brock,2017-04-02 18:25:00,4053," I think some animals are hard to get on a trail camera. They know it's there (from scent I guess) and they avoid it.  The wolf biologist at the Haliburton Forest said I won't get wolves on my trail camera and I haven't and there's quite a few around. He said the best way to get them is in the winter get a beaver carcass from the trapper, make sure it's frozen, covered with ice so other critters have trouble getting at it, and it will likely take 3 weeks until the wolves will be bold enough to come.  To get my scat tested it's a minimum of $550, maximum $900, so that's definitely not happening."
998887,manitoubass2,2017-04-02 18:53:00,11391,Yeah and most trail cams are set up in shooting lanes etc when it's hunters. That doesn't help either
999072,tomO,2017-04-04 03:13:00,363,"I remember seeing long legged rabbits near northbrook on Gull Lake in the early 70s. Jack rabbits I guess, they still around?"
999073,John Bacon,2017-04-04 03:16:00,3277,"I remember seeing long legged rabbits near northbrook on Gull Lake in the early 70s. Jack rabbits I guess, they still around?  I am not sure how many are around now, but I remember seeing one in Scarborough in the 90s."
999076,chris.brock,2017-04-04 03:33:00,4053," That's a snowshoe hare, they are brown in the summer, probably see them at dusk. That's the southern edge of their range but they are still around for sure."

999424,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 13:54:00,11391,"Holy crap, must be a full time job. That's alot of moose and alot of work.  I don't think poaching in my area is a problem, the cos are out heavy on the 502 area and it's super strict during hunting season.  It's nice to see the populations rise. I was getting worried for Abit. You could be in the bush a full week without any sign of a moose, and that's just not normal here at all. Now it's probably close to 75% recovered. Seeing lots of calves too.  Anyone been to redlake Ontario? Like just north of ear falls??? Holy man you'll never see so many moose in your life come fall. You can barely reach the speed limit before you have to stop again. It's annoying, but quite the sight. Too far for me to go to justify a hunt though, 6 hours north, I'll stick to the Dryden highway area"
998126,smitty55,2017-03-27 01:44:00,928,No surprise to me after all the reports over the years.  http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/thunder-bay/cougar-carcass-found-frozen-in-snow-northwest-of-thunder-bay-may-answer-mountain-lion-mystery-1.4041876 
998127,manitoubass2,2017-03-27 01:58:00,11391,"Lol the first documented one.  Cool, glad we can finally end that debate"
998129,OhioFisherman,2017-03-27 02:07:00,6623,"Not a surprise to me either, Ontario is bigger than California, with a lot less people, they see them in California."
998131,GBW,2017-03-27 02:25:00,8460,See the teeth on that thing?!??!
998133,chris.brock,2017-03-27 03:12:00,4053,"Cool story smitty!  The expert confirming this is a taxidermist, not someone from the MNR. It seems like the MNR doesn't want any part of this discussion and I don't know why. Just weird. I can't think of a reason for them avoiding the topic.  I didn't know Gord Ellis also worked for the CBC either.   edit- I've got some scat in my freezer from Haliburton. It's not my style to bug the MNR, they gave me the cold shoulder. If anyone has a contact to do a DNA test let me know. If the cost wasn't too stupid I would pay out of pocket."
998135,4x4bassin,2017-03-27 04:23:00,1025,Thanks for the read Smitty !!!
998153,Moosebunk,2017-03-27 13:37:00,3970,Wrong kinda cougars you'd want to meet alone in the woods.
998156,Lape0019,2017-03-27 13:45:00,647,"As stated in the article, if Cougars are listed on the OMNRF as an endangered species, isn't that proof all along that they are in fact in Ontario?  I was actually surprised to read that part of the article since every post I have ever read stated the MNR wanted nothing to do with stating outright there were these big cats in Ontario."
998161,manitoubass2,2017-03-27 13:49:00,11391,Hard to walk the woods in high heels ???
998165,AKRISONER,2017-03-27 14:27:00,5558,"Hard to walk the woods in high heels  Lollll   when can we get tags for the endangered species hunt!?  i can already see the trophy hunters licking their chops. and measuring another part of their body in the hopes it has grown a millimeter.  thats another debate...we need to be doing everything we can now that we have proof that they exist to protect this species. Weve done our job ruining the population, now its our job to steward them back.   Chris, the reason for the MNR's denial is rumored to be that by denying reports of locations and sightings they can protect this vulnerable species from poachers.  the last thing the MNR wants is to confirm that there is a cougar from manitoulin and then jimbo and his crew of flunkies runs up to manitoulin in the hopes of selling cougar teeth for boner medicine at dundas and spadina."
998167,richyb,2017-03-27 14:40:00,774,It might be a good thing that the mnr doesnt make a big deal out of it . Look at this algonquin wolf crap. Closing down areas to hunting and trapping coyotes and wolf because of it. Taking cash out of the trappers pockets. If the antis get rolling with this they might do something stupid like cancelling the deer hunt to protect the cougars food source.
998181,4x4bassin,2017-03-27 16:21:00,1025,"^^^ ""Selling cougar teeth for boner medicine at Dundas and Spadina""  that's funny but sadly , probably the truth !!!"
998207,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-27 19:25:00,10439,Back in the late 90's I had a visit from an Eastern cougar at my place in Grand Valley. Didn't bother reporting it to anyone.
998213,grimsbylander,2017-03-27 19:59:00,3016,Cougar shmooger...that's just a Maine Coon house cat.
998252,chris.brock,2017-03-28 00:44:00,4053,"Interesting, I didn't know that. Seems a little silly though. Good luck to the poacher targeting Ontario cougars, probably a better chance for a squatch or a unicorn."
998254,manitoubass2,2017-03-28 00:51:00,11391,Yep. I'd say that rumour is just that
998273,AKRISONER,2017-03-28 12:35:00,5558,"if a dead cougar was worth $100,000 to the local ""medicine"" shops would you still think so?  ive seen folks do a lot crazier ish for a lot less."
998278,grimsbylander,2017-03-28 13:21:00,3016,"Yeah but I think I could drive out west, poach a cougar and drive back 5 different times quicker than you'd find one in Ontario."
998279,manitoubass2,2017-03-28 13:31:00,11391,"Yep, I was gonna say the same thing"
998280,AKRISONER,2017-03-28 13:42:00,5558,"good point grimsby  of course this is all just talk, i really dont have an opinion except for the fact that I am glad to see them back.  Call me crazy...but the reductions of pesticides, the addition of hunting regulations, the idea of conservation is doing wonders to improve animal numbers and their natural habitat...maybe not so much in the GTA where we are growing at an absurd rate, but being in the bush and on the lake weekly for the past 15 years I have noticed a significant incline in the numbers of wildlife I am witnessing. Specifically in areas where humans had ruined or poisoned the native species habitat.  The first 10 years in PAB i never saw a bald eagle, now they are everywhere. We now have wolves frequenting our area, the fishing  volume and size has been on a constant incline and this past winter we even found tracks from a lynx."
998284,manitoubass2,2017-03-28 13:58:00,11391,"That's happening here too akri. There was substantial wildlife already in my area, but it's no doubt been booming about the past couple years.  Of course some say that's because the deer population is nuts, and it is. That predators are following them into urban settings  Which may be true. But I also see way more wildlife in the bush these days too  When moose hunts were sketchy at best for 10 years or so, maybe getting skunked in 10 days, now many are getting their moose the first day.  Trappers are reporting crazy numbers of catches.  Also, how bout them elk??? We never had elk really until 15 years ago.they must breed like rabbits because they are everywhere too  Wolves and coyotes are rediculous  One thing im seeing less of is bears"

Elk is another great one. i have been hearing that elk population is exploding."
998299,Jon,2017-03-28 15:42:00,209,Chris:  I don't know if they accept one-offs or what the cost would be for a DNA sample but try here - http://ccdb.ca/.  Jon

Elk is another great one. i have been hearing that elk population is exploding.  Remember too that animals get pushed out of their habitat naturally, not just by humans. I just read that in 2015 the cougar population in Alberta has tripled since 2005. From 680 animals to 2000+. Through natural expansion, their territory will gradually increase and with very few here, this is a perfect habitat free of competition. I'm no biologist but look what happened to the population of Barrie when housing prices rose in Toronto    For the record, I only heard about the cougars in Barrie. lol"
998314,manitoubass2,2017-03-28 18:26:00,11391,"Wow 2000+!  All I ever seen in northern Alberta, which is awesome habitat BTW, was tonnes of caribou, elk and bear.  I've seen 3 cougars in NW Ontario, none in Alberta. Kinda bummed on that"
