998380,porkpie,2017-03-29 11:00:00,2521,"I am very surprised to hear that. Out of dozens of orders over the years, the only places that I've never been charged outrageous fees are from cabelas and bass pro.  Every time they ship, they ensure all brokerage fees are included in the final price.  I won't order from any small US operations unless they ship USPS, but Cabelas and Bass pro have always been solid.  You must have had a bit of bad luck."

997512,captpierre,2017-03-21 14:24:00,2521,Never ordered anything from America. Thinking of doing so from eBay.com or Amazon.com. Is it straight forward? What about extra fees like duty? Peter
997513,NANUK,2017-03-21 14:31:00,797,"Duties can be a hit and miss depending on the amount and item description, goods made in USA have no duties, I have had good luck with US postal service. And the worst luck with UPS, they even charge a brokerage fee. I don't buy from sellers who use only UPS for shipping."
997514,Terry,2017-03-21 14:33:00,14456,"eBay.com   or ebay.ca is the same but they show cdn prices  if it does not show up on ebay.ca but is on .com, most times it means they dont ship to canada,  if you have them ship by usps/ canada post they often just let it go though but the greater the price the more chance on them checking for duty and taxes Amazon.com. most times include everything in their final price see if it is for sale on amazon .ca too"
997519,Lape0019,2017-03-21 15:21:00,647,"Everything I have read here is accurate to what I have experienced in the past. I started shipping to a company in the US to take advantage of free shipping within the states and just go and pick it up myself but I live close to the border. The nice thing is you get free shipping there and you don't have to worry about EPS charging you a ridiculous brokerage fee.  But yes, I have always tried to order stuff from places that ship USPS is it is under $100 and if I am delivering to my door.  And as a side note, assume you will be hit with customs. 9/10 times I find even when an item is on sale, once you add is duties, HST and shipping, I can get it cheaper here by shopping around."
997520,John Bacon,2017-03-21 15:28:00,3277,"Have you checked Amazon.ca?  If you order from Amazon.ca you don't have to worry about duty, exchange, etc."
997536,BillM,2017-03-21 17:49:00,17367,"Shipping must be with USPS, or else you'll pay some crazy brokerage charges with UPS, FedEx or DHL).   Sometimes items get through customs without duty charged sometimes they don't."
997537,Big Cliff,2017-03-21 18:10:00,6899,"I have started buying a lot of stuff through Amazon and it's saved me a bundle! Printer cartridges that I pay $79.00 a set for at Staples, got them on Amazon (2 sets plus a spare bulk black) $23.00 and they work perfectly.  Even my razors, drug store $12.95 for a pack of 3; Amazon $5.25 for a pack of 4 delivered to my door. I haven't had as much luck on Ebay a lot of items I see coming from the US look good but many of them add crazy shipping charges. I have bought some items through Ebay that come from China, never had a problem and saved a pile of money.  Bought a fully loaded android box through Amazon, $60.00 (closest thing i could find to it anywhere else was well over $100.00). Be careful though not everything is a super deal: wanted a DeWalt 20v circular saw, best price on Amazon was $179.00, got it on Ebay $107.00 CDN delivered to my door free shipping."
997555,spincast,2017-03-21 21:47:00,3279,"Duties: you can mail $50.00 no duties payable - but if you use a courier they will charge you duties and brokerage fee (subsidises the ""low low shipping rates) . I've actually had brokerage and duties work out to be more that the package (UPS) USPS will work if it is under $50 (remember, exchange rate applies.)  You can arrange to ship to a company on the other side of the border and they will hold it for 30 days for 5 bucks US (most places). Then you have the Canadian exemption when you come back ( as only Canada could do, this is actually less than if you mail it??  - $35 I believe?) Collecting that is at the discretion of the officer at the booth. Frequently if it is under 200 they won't go through the paperwork for the HST. If you have a friend who lives close to the border it can be worthwhile. For instance - headlight for our minivan. Canada - $450.00. On line from California - $94 US shipped anywhere, Courier, Sarnia to me,$15.00. And now I have to a share couple beers with a bud to say thanks for picking it up. Its all situational - I have found in most instances it ends up costing the same or more from the US- and unless the difference is huge, (like the above) - I prefer to buy local."
997558,G.mech,2017-03-21 22:01:00,830,"Out of at least 2 dozen packages I had sent from the US this winter by USPS, only one was dinged for taxes and duty (it was an $800 order).  The others were somewhat less but all were well over $50 and none were picked up by customs.   Even the one I paid the tax and duty on was still far cheaper than I could get the stuff here even considering the exchange and shipping.  I would prefer to shop local too I guess but if I can't find what I want without going to 3 different stores and then have to pay a higher price I think I'll continue to shop on-line."

997572,manitoubass2,2017-03-21 23:43:00,11391,Stay away from anything UPS. Their service is horrible and anything in the $100 range you'll pay another $50 in brokerage fees.   Amazon is amazing. As is eBay. My wife gets stuff on eBay all the time and it's saved us tons of money  eBay the shipping is hit and miss. I've had items show up in 3 days or a month. Some of the China stuff takes time.  No idea how amazon does it but my orders never take more than 3 days. If you order by 8am you might even get it the next day
997578,adempsey,2017-03-22 00:58:00,1498,"What Amazon invoices you is what you will pay.  At least, that's been my experience for years of ordering.   However, they do have that whole third party reseller component that's more like eBay.   WIth eBay, I think I was charged duty/taxes once out of at least 50 purchases. I don't even remember what it was.  Probably from an eBay retail store that did not put ""Gift"" on the package.   They aren't really supposed to indicate ""Gift"", but most do.    Other places like Bass Pro and Cabelas charge you the duty, taxes and brokerage upfront.  So, you know what your order cost will be and there will be no surprise fees.   Places like Tackle Warehouse use UPS and FedEx and along with your order you get a nice bill for brokerage, duty and taxes before you get your package.  Don't discount ordering from the UK either. I've found great prices there and the shipping is fairly cheap through Royal Mail.  Longest delivery time was 8 days, shortest 5 days.  No extra duties or taxes charged so far either."

997613,Tom S,2017-03-22 14:18:00,362,"The only time I've had an issue is when things were shipped UPS. They like to tack on a 'brokerage' fee.  Reputable business will have all the duties, taxes, and fees worked out on your bill already so you don't need to worry about it.  If you're purchasing from someone personally or from e-bay have it declared as a gift.  As adempsey mentioned, check out UK sites as well. I've had them honor free international shipping offers without any fuss. Compare that to Bass Pro, who can't even be bothered to set up a website in Canadian dollars."

A $100 item can turn into a $200 item pretty quick with all those fees !!!
