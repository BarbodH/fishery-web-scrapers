999190,Freshtrax,2017-04-05 03:48:00,2215,Tough fishing Sunday we trolled for hours without moving a rod.   Ended up with this guy  my dads first  brown he was pretty pumped. Not huge but a nice mean looking fish.   Best part was Getting out with dad as we only fish together  a few times a year.  
999192,GBW,2017-04-05 03:56:00,8460,"very nice, good times I'm sure were had.  Big 'kape' on the both of them too. Sorry I'm kidding on the dad kape!  Sorry"
999193,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-05 03:59:00,8243,"I'm jealous. I need to get my boat out ASAP, no excuses.  That is one pretty fish there. You must be proud to put the Pops on his first Brown. I have never got one yet as well. I don't fish for them but this month yes sir. I am expanding the pic to see what you are using. No clues."
999194,Freshtrax,2017-04-05 04:03:00,2215,"Mag green and black ladderback spoon Down 8 0ver 14 50 ft back, couldn't get a bite on stick baits all day."
999206,Terry,2017-04-05 09:47:00,14456,nice
999217,dave524,2017-04-05 12:28:00,4508,"Nice, I always found a more stealthy approach would catch more Browns, planer boards or further back than 50 feet if behind the boat when flatlining or rigging in shallower water."
999218,manitoubass2,2017-04-05 12:42:00,11391,Beauty! Im stoked you put your dad on that fish!  Awesome memory
999227,JoshS,2017-04-05 13:52:00,729,Sweet. I was itching to go Sunday but my boats still in storage. did you catch a water temp?
999239,ckewley,2017-04-05 14:56:00,699,"Awesome stuff Andrew, we need to chase Brookies soon"
999246,Freshtrax,2017-04-05 15:19:00,2215,Ice out I'll take you to that spot we always chat about !
999248,Freshtrax,2017-04-05 15:22:00,2215, Temps were 38-42.  Mostly cooler with tiny pockets of warmer water
999291,BillM,2017-04-05 18:02:00,17367,Should be on in a few weeks once we get some stable weather.  Can't wait!  (Although not looking forward to the drive)
999302,Joeytier,2017-04-05 19:21:00,3990,"Great brown, I'm jealous!  Been tuning everything up last couple days but realistically we're still 2 weeks away from any open water prospects here."
999308,huzzsaba,2017-04-05 20:09:00,884,Nice fish! Sounds like in the end it was all worth it!
999310,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-05 20:26:00,8243,"I just today went through my thousands of dollars of plugs, spinners and spoons. I need to call the Insurance company. Since I took my pension I buy a lure every month on pay week, $10.00 X 12 = $120.00 X 17 = $2040.00. I know I spend more than 10 bananas a month so it's probably closer to 4K not $2000.00. Don't add it up.  Sharpened hooks, changed hooks and swivels and polished chrome. I have them lined up in order of weapons of mass destruction. All I need is some warmer weather (arthritis and cold mornings is a no go now) and to turn the key on the StarCraft.  Thanks for the tips Andrew."
999317,misfish,2017-04-05 20:51:00,29133,Great looking male brownie.
999360,spincast,2017-04-06 01:03:00,3279,"any time you boat one on the fist outing of the year, in the first week of April is a bonus  - guess I decided to pull up just a little bit too soon? - saw you heading out to PD direction, and  we ended our day there. Saw a ton of hooks on the screen but nothing was moving. you must got that right on his schnozola. Sounds like it was your lucky spoon again?"
999365,Freshtrax,2017-04-06 01:23:00,2215," Ha it was a Hail Mary .  not what first comes to mind when I think of a brown trout lure , I even said to my dad "" check out all the teeth marks""  when I put it on."
999410,dave524,2017-04-06 13:01:00,4508,I know the shoreline is like a double/double right now with the wind and the rain but from my experience most guys are too far offshore for early season browns from watching the lake at my street and my own many years on the water. If you are not POing the shore casters you are out too far IMHO. Steve seems to have the early season browns dialed in .
999436,BillM,2017-04-06 15:14:00,17367,"Yeah you need to be real close for spring browns, 20ft of water is way too much.   If you aren't hitting bottom with the lures off the boards once in a while, move closer"
