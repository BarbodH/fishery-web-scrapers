998790,Tom S,2017-04-01 18:36:00,362,"Finished up a rod rebuild that I've been working on for quite a while now. It's an Algonquin 9'6"" 9wt fly rod, it would have been made in Toronto area in the late 70's to early 80's using Fenwick components. I picked it up from a yard sale, it was pretty beat up and looked like it might have been used for Salmon flossing as it had damage to the ferrules that had been somewhat repaired with electrical tape. I kept the original reel seat, even through it's a bit banged up it is fully functional and keeps a connection to the original rod.  Work done includes: -Strip down to bare blank -Replacing the cork with a proper Fenwick grip -New metal winding check -New guides, wrapped with back thread with a white three-turn inlay  This rod also has an extension for the grip that fits into a socket on the end of the reel seat and should allow some switch casting as well. Looking forward to getting it out on the water.        "
998795,Roe Bag,2017-04-01 19:22:00,246,Nicely done! Had 9 1/2'  6/7 weight Algonquin fly rod with a Shakespeare Under spin reel. My first steelhead rod back in the 70's. Pretty much the only thing over 7' long back in those days. How times change.
