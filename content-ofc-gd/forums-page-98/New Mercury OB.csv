998399,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-29 16:09:00,10439,I wonder if these will ever make it to the consumer market?  http://www.sportfishingmag.com/mercury-racing-unveils-optimax-diesel-outboard?con=TrueAnthem&dom=fb&src=SOC&utm_campaign=&utm_content=58db6985a167da000708cd8f&utm_medium=&utm_source=#page-6
998417,Dara,2017-03-29 20:22:00,3052,"Not for me...glad to be rid of 2 stroke smell, I'm not going diesel."
998420,Fisherman,2017-03-29 20:55:00,7201,"2 Stroke, 4 stroke and now diesel anchors.  What will Merc think of next."
998428,misfish,2017-03-29 21:57:00,29133,"2 Stroke, 4 stroke and now diesel anchors.  What will Merc think of next.  Electric hybrid??????????"
998436,Fisherman,2017-03-29 23:34:00,7201,I hear Merc is adding longer recoil rope so you don't have to buy any to make an anchor.

998674,Dara,2017-03-31 18:37:00,3052,"Awesome engines those mercs, Mine has saved my butt many many times.   So it actually started?  Back in the day, we considered Johnson and Evinrude to be fishing motors and mercury to be the speed motor if you wanted a fast boat or to tow skiers."
998680,porkpie,2017-03-31 20:22:00,2521,"I don't know, I'm on the water a fair bit during the season.  I haven't seen too many broken down late model Merc's.  It wouldn't be my first choice of engine, but I think they may be enjoying a poor rep from years ago.  On the other hand, I've personally witnessed a couple of broken down late model Polaris ATV's while out ice fishing, so I still believe that one!"
998682,Mister G,2017-03-31 20:45:00,1429,ANYONE who hasn't experience a modern day E-TEC outboard has no idea that they have surpassed the Black ANCHORS by 6 fathoms or more . . . ..... . . . . ..... . . . .
