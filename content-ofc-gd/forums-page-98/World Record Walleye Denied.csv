998783,John Bacon,2017-04-01 18:11:00,3277,"https://www.in-depthoutdoors.com/community/forums/topic/walleye_67523/  This story was floating around in 2003?  April 1st, 2003?    Interesting anecdote from the link:  Quote: You just had to be there!  Professional walleye angler, Bill Kutka, tells the funniest fish attractant story you’ll ever hear. This is a true story that actually happened in a walleye tournament a couple years ago. First, a little background…. It seems that Preparation “H” ( that’s right, the hemorrhoid medication ) has gained a small following as a fish attractant. Kutka was totally unaware of this fact. At a major national tournament, Kutka was paired with an angler he’d never met before. They got out onto the water and the guy asks, ” So, have you heard about Preparation “H”? Kutka hesitates then responds, “Sure, I’ve heard about it.” “Works pretty good doesn’t it?” the guy smiles. Now remember, Kutka has no idea that Prep “H” has any use other than as a medication. Kutka pauses and then admits, “Yeah, I guess it works OK.” The guy smiles and in an exuberant tone asks, “You want me to put some on for you?” Well, needless to say there was a bit of confusion in the boat, but once they figured out what had happened, a good laugh was had by all. Hopefully, you’ve gotten a chuckle out of the incident as well!"
