My 96 Honda 25 had some gaskets replaced 3 years ago,  when the mechanic looked inside he was amazed at the complete lack of wear on moving components, valve train etc.  Synthetic oil was the answer,  In almost 20 years of running valves had never been adjusted or required it.  Compression was still at 100%.  My son has had it for 3 years and put a pile of miles on it and still fine."
998658,Roe Bag,2017-03-31 17:01:00,246,Hole shot can last a lot more that 2-3 seconds if the motor does not have adequate torque.  Good hole shot is more important to me than the highest top end speed.  It's not about compensating for anything; I just want my boat to be up on plane when I am driving it.   Hasn't Honday been making four strokes for most if not all of those fifty years?  Lund Fury 1600. 40 horse 4 stroke. 4 blade Spitfire Mercury prop. Three grown men and all of our gear. Boat literally jumps out of the water and onto plane in the blink of an eye. Tops out at just under 30 mph @ 6000 rpm.  Honda has been making 4 strokes for over fifty years but it's been a slow progression from small portable fishing motors (7.5 thru 10 hp) to what's available today.  https://marine.honda.com/company/about-us

But then....I'm a 4 stroke motor person - not that two strokes don't have their positives -  4 stroke - just easier, no smell, no oil slicks, no measuring, or adding oil on the water. I remember when I used to ride motocross the two strokes kicked  . Couldn't be beat. Then came something called the Elsinore 4 stroke by Honda. and the difference in response changed - at least for smaller bore engines. Its like the aluminium versus 'glass discussion - there are damn good motors in each category - buy the one you like best and at least then if something does go pear shaped........ you own it. I got a 4 stroke Suzuki 20 for a kicker,( only weighs 10 lbs more than the 10 hp, 4 stroke btw)  My first boat had a 2 stroke suzi. Both great motors. There is NO smoke from a E-TEC outboard and they just got a a lot better overall with the G2 . . . . Do some research on them and you will be blow way and might even buy one the next time around."
998690,Mister G,2017-03-31 20:57:00,1429," Hole shots are for drag racers and tournament fishermen. Quiet, economical and reliable 4 strokes are the way to go.

To be honest when I first started running four strokes, I missed the smell of a two stroke in the morning. Still able to get my fix from my chainsaw, leaf blower and whipper snipper. All ready ""blown away"" by the four strokes I have had and currently own. (Suzuki 15, Yamaha 20 and a  Mercury 40) Sorry. No E-TECH in my future. Especially if the appearance of the G2 trickles down to their smaller outboards. Gotta be the ugliest thing on the water. Dreamed up by some kid and his Lego set."

Read the whole post, perhaps, before those fingers hop out of the saddle and start spraying those who choose to contribute to a discussion on an adult level?  And yes,I have been on the water with an Etec. Nice motor. However, to claim that it is better than a 4 stroke of comparable vintage, well, that is your opinion. One I don't share it. As I said - its a matter of choice, there are good motors regardless of what you select. ..trolling is for catching fish, try it sometime.Shame how instead of answering the OPs question you prefer to get out the spoon so often, eh? how's those bearings?"
998719,scugpg,2017-03-31 23:56:00,1373,"4 stroke. Quiter, no smoke and no mixing gas.  Figure out what boat you want and size the motor to it especially if you want it to plane out. 2 strokes have the slight edge there being typically lighter for said hp."

A 14 ft boat with a 15 will cost considerably more as well.  Cheers"

998979,chris.brock,2017-04-03 13:07:00,4053, The newer 4 strokes may not last for decades like some of the 2 strokes from the 80's. The marine mechanic by my cottage has seen quite a few 4 strokes (different brands) about 12 years old that are basically worn out to the point they're not worth fixing.
998457,Rizzo,2017-03-30 02:07:00,4754,"We recently got a waterfront property, so now I have need for a tinny to keep up there both for my use, and if we rent the place, something for the renters. I plan to get an aluminum in the 12-14 foot range, with a motor somewhere in the 9.9 to 15 hp range. Its not a big lake, but want something with enough pep to maybe tow one of my kids (one at a time!) on a tube once in a while. They are young, don't need too much of a thrill. But for the most part...trolling around (also with the kids) for an hour or two here and there. Its been a while since I owned a 2 stroke, but I think I am leaning that way.  Having said that...very open to suggestions on both 2 vs 4 stroke, specific manufacturers and also the vintage of the motor. Was hoping to get something maybe 10 years old...but see lots of motors from the 1980's that guys are charging huge dollars for. Are the 80's motors bulletproof or something? I am stunned to see what people are asking for them on Kijiji.  Almost has me wondering if ""they don't make em like the good old days"" because prices of 1980's motors seem almost the same as early 2000's. Then again...just because guys are asking $900 for a 35 year old 9.9 doesn't mean they are getting it!"
998486,craigdritchie,2017-03-30 12:26:00,1586,"Rizzo - you may as well spend the extra few bucks and buy a new engine. You're right in that old, small outboards really hold their value, and you pay almost as much for a 30 year old 9.9 or 15 as you will for a new one. People ask that much money because they will get it - especially at this time of year. That being the case, you may as well spend the extra couple of bucks and get a new engine with a full warranty. Plus then you have no nauseating exhaust fumes ... no annoying fuel leaks ... no oil slicks every time you start it up ... no annoying rattling and vibration ... and way better fuel economy. Hit a rock or damage it somehow, and parts are readily available, the dealer will have it in stock. That's not always the case with old engines.  If you want a new two-stroke, the only option is the Evinrude E-TEC 15, since they're the only two-stroke manufacturer in our market and they don't make anything smaller. This engine is actually a de-tuned 25, and it weights 181 pounds. As a result, they don't sell many of them, mostly as kickers for guys who have big E-TECs as their main power on big walleye boats.  Among 15 horsepower four-strokes, the Merc is 115 pounds, the Yamaha is 111 pounds, the Suzuki is 97 pounds, and the Honda is 103 pounds. All of them are outstanding engines, and all of them will last a lifetime with reasonable care and maintenance.  No, they don't make 'em like they used to. The new engines are so much better than the outboards from the 1980s it's not even funny - it's like comparing a new car to the one your parents drove when you were a little kid. Given the small price difference, buying new is a no-brainer.  If you have a 12-foot boat, get the 9.9. If you go with a 14 footer, get the 15 hp. Cost for the 9.9 is a little less than for a 15, but remember - both hold their value like crazy, and 30 years from now you can probably sell it to some guy for more than you paid for it. You know, the way the guys on Kijiji flogging 30 year-old engines are doing right now."
998487,AKRISONER,2017-03-30 12:46:00,5558,"as a current user of a 88 suzuki...i will stand behind the sentiment that they just dont make em like they used to.  1 pull at -10 and the thing is purring like a kitten. Engine starts running like crap? Spray out the carb with some solvent, throw a lil premium and seafoam in...vroom vroom  maybe todays 2 stroke outboards are the same? maybe this is all just a stigma?  I will say the new 4 stroke 175 yammy we got last year...oh baby that thing is niiiiceeee"
998497,Korber,2017-03-30 14:34:00,79,"I agree with Akrisoner here. They don't make them like the used too! Also I have an 80's 2 stroke Evinrude 25 HP for my 14, the engine runs mint, there is more then enough new, aftermarket and used parts out there that finding something when I break it (*knock on wood*) will be easy. That being said I agree with you that the used older motors are not cheap and the price can get up there, I spent $900 on my 25 HP. Best off to keep an eye on Kijiji or head up north and find a ""Mom and Pop"" marina or small engine shop. 90% that old guy working there has 10 motors out back he could sell you. My buddy father in law has a place like that on the 127 North of Bancroft. I got my boat and motor there and couldn't be happier. Most of the older motors are pretty bullet proof too, for me that says it all.  Buying new does give you a full life for the motor but the way I look at it, the parts are more expensive when it does break down. But they are nice and shiny :0  2 Stroke over 4 stroke all the way, mixing fuel is easy and the engines are lighter."

It runs like a scalded dog and it weighs less than a new 150 either 2 or 4 stroke. I am maxed out weigh wise on my Ranger so I decided to rebuild it. I was able to easily locate all of the parts needed and as I was rebuilding it I found out it was actually a GTX150 under the GT150 hood.....Bonus. I restore older cars and motorcycles and to me the late 70's to late 80's was the golden age for serviceable and reliable engines.
