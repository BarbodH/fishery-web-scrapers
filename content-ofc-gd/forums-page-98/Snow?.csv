998305,captpierre,2017-03-28 16:55:00,2521,Much snow left in Haliburton? I'm guessing won't be too much flooding with a quick thaw.
998307,GBW,2017-03-28 17:22:00,8460,Burnt river was VERY high (flooded over the banks) 4 to 6 weeks ago and has since dropped to high levels but not 'flooding'.  Hali should have little to no snow by now
998312,jimmer,2017-03-28 18:04:00,2730,I would bet that there is still a bunch in the bush.
998317,Joeytier,2017-03-28 18:46:00,3990,"Callander to Powassan has very little left in the bush.  Hali might have some up in the higher areas closer to the park, but down closer to the Kawarthas I can't imagine there being much."
998319,lew,2017-03-28 18:59:00,12766,I'm just south of Burleigh Falls and although the fields are all bare there's still plenty of snow in the heavier woods  so I would guess the Haliburton area will be similar.
998385,singingdog,2017-03-29 12:02:00,1047,"Still about 25 cms of very crusty snow in my yard. South facing slopes are mostly clear, everywhere else there is still a pretty solid base."
998543,GBW,2017-03-30 20:39:00,8460,I went to the folks place for a quick visit today and they have snow in the bush but the rest is gone.  The lake is still frozen but with how it looked no way I was going to get on it to check thickness.  Again I'm talking about Burnt River area.  This river has dropped to what I would call close to normal levels too. They are still letting a LOT of water out of Cameron at the Fenelon Falls dam
998656,Dara,2017-03-31 17:00:00,3052,"Still lots here    Yesterday just outside Chapleau  It says, Arctic Watershed..from here all rivers flow north to Arctic ocean"
998659,jimmer,2017-03-31 17:05:00,2730,I noticed they just open the dam in Lindsay the other day.  I was worried with the walleye spawn coming up.
998726,GBW,2017-04-01 00:36:00,8460,I noticed they just open the dam in Lindsay the other day.  I was worried with the walleye spawn coming up. I haven't been down there in a bit to have a look.
998728,Joeytier,2017-04-01 01:25:00,3990,"Trails are still open?  Were fishing around Latchford tomorrow, almost waist deep snow in the bush around there still."
998736,Dara,2017-04-01 03:27:00,3052,Trails near wawa are open. 101 chapeau to timmins are closed. There is snow but every hundred yards is bare. The lakes are amazing. They are so slick you could play an NHL game on any one. You couldn't walk across without falling down.
