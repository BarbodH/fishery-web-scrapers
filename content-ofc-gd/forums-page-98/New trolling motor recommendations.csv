998445,msp,2017-03-30 01:10:00,1336,Blew my 10 yr old minn Kota power drive to bits today while out on the water. I'm going to try and pull it apart tomorrow to see if I can fix it with some new parts or mayb just some new bearings. If all the else fails I may just bite the bullet and buy a new one. I have experience with the maxuum motors and prefer the cable drive but don't like having the foot pedal sitting so far back on my deck as well as not being recessed in the floor. I tried the edge model and loved it too. What do you guys like ( maybe Terrova? )as well as a good min Kota dealer near TO Thanks
998449,porkpie,2017-03-30 01:37:00,2521,"Depends on what you want.  If I could recommend any one thing it would be to get an ipilot equipped unit.  As for Powerdrive or terrova, it really depends on how much you want a foot pedal as that's the main difference in Ipilot units. My experience is that I have used the foot pedal maybe once or twice. I run almost entirely off the remote, so for me it's not an issue.  I'm not a fan of cable drives so can't help you there.  I imagine they are pretty handy if you are a bass guy.  Sail seems the most economical if you can wait into they have the 15 percent off sale."
998464,John Bacon,2017-03-30 04:58:00,3277,"The cable drive does give better control in tight cover.  An iPilot or Xi5 will give you lots of other advantages such as spot lock, auto steer the boat, memorized routes, etc.If you fish exclusivily heavy cover, a cable drive will give you better control.  If you troll or fish more open water; I would recommend an iPilot or Xi5.  I wouldn't consider a power steer model that didn't have an auto pilot system."

I would be surprised though, that's cutting into the terrova market for less $$. For a foot pedal you need to go to the terrova or an xi5."

998484,Lape0019,2017-03-30 12:17:00,647,"Even with the new Powerdrive, if it is equipped with I-pilot, you cannot use the pedal.  Having used the previous two Powerdrives (original and V2) and owning a 2nd gen Terrova with I-Pilot, get the Terrova. The only feature missing on mine that the redesigned Terrova has that  I would love to have is the spot lock button on the pedal. Otherwise, they both will both work great .  If you feel like installing a recessed foot pedal tray, I would look at the Ultrex as the best of both worlds between a cable driven and electric steer.  Good luck on your search. If I was in your shoes though and I could swing it, the Ultrex is where I would be looking the closest at."

998506,Lape0019,2017-03-30 15:51:00,647,The ergonomics of the Terrova pedal alone are worth it's weight in gold over the Powerdrive. I honestly cannot stand the Powerdrive pedal at all. Drives me nuts every time I have to use it.
998507,Mister G,2017-03-30 15:57:00,1429,"I got my boat with a 70# Power Drive V2 and by the end of the year I added i-pilot on it and NEVER missed the foot pedal, actually didn't care for the foot pedal.  However, if I ever need to replace it, it will be this one without hesitation in 24 volt 60"" shaft.  http://www.basspro.com/Minn-Kota-Ulterra-Bow-Mount-Bluetooth-Trolling-Motor-with-iPilot-US2/product/164041/"

998520,msp,2017-03-30 17:36:00,1336,One thing I forgot to mention is that I am on my third pedal on my power driv in the 10 yrs I have had it. I am not particularly fond of the pedals. To me the hand held remote would seem like a pain while fishing...... Not sure The ulterra seems to b way out of my price range. How good are the foot pedals on the Terrova ?
998527,Lape0019,2017-03-30 19:03:00,647,"I've had mine 3 seasons now and had to replace mine under warranty. It could have been fixed but the repair depot kept ordering the wrong parts and just gave me a new pedal instead. from using my foot to adjust the speed, the adjuster would just keep rolling past 10. and when on 10, the remote would show 7.5 as the speed setting so I got a new pedal.  I have not had any problems with the replacement one."

998721,msp,2017-04-01 00:01:00,1336,Anyone have experience with the Power Drive V 2? Specifically the pedal? I'm a little bit sceptical ....... Wondering if it is just as crappy as the old power drive pedal Might go with a 70 pound thrust PD v2
998724,Raf,2017-04-01 00:19:00,3495,"the PD pedals are known to be flaky (although the one I have has been going for 7+ years) but I have a hard time getting used to cable steer... electric steer for this guy.  i'd like to try the ipilot and features like spot lock and gps would be nice but i find, for muskie fishing at least, the PD works great.  don't see a use for spot lock the way i fish and would find using a handheld device to control the boat to be awkward."
998727,scugpg,2017-04-01 01:25:00,1373,I find the terrova pedal much easier to use than the pd. It also stows and deploys a lot better. Also find the steering more responsive. Terrova is a much nicer unit overall.
998801,Sinker,2017-04-01 19:48:00,8692,"I agree that the terrova is a better unit than the PD, but there's nothing wrong with the PD V2. If you had a V1 before the V2 has a better pedal.  S."
998847,ecmilley,2017-04-02 13:17:00,2163,"all have there good points, i prefer cable steer its faster better for the kind of fishing i do, had a maxxum for several years and broke it lots, minn kota were known to have armature issues and mine was no diffrent, last year the foot pedal died at a replacement cost of around 350 for part, put a used refurbed motorguide 82lb digital on boat, i really like the cable steer foot pedal from mg better than mk the weedless wedge props seems to work better though really a push in the end, have a weed cutter installed on motor makes everything work good"
998854,limeyangler,2017-04-02 14:41:00,5204,Surprised nobody mentioned the new Minn Kota Ultrex. Take a look.  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/Ultrex.aspx
998893,msp,2017-04-02 19:58:00,1336,Thanks for all the replies guys. I was very close to purchasing the 80 pound thrust Fortrex but couldn't come up with the 1600 $ plus tax. Not to mention a recessed pedal box and all the hassles of installation. I ended up with a brand new  second hand 70 pound power drive v2. Comes with universal sonar and the newer foot pedal. Installation took me about 20 minutes as the bracket from the old one fit perfect All for 800 cash Case closed. Thanks again guys!
