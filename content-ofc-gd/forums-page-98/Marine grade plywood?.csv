999025,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-03 21:50:00,8243,"Many boat rebuilders are going to pressure treated plywood. Sealing it with spar varnish or similar 100% especially where it will contact Aluminum. Even Marine grade will eventually rot if exposed to water continuosly, it just takes longer. I had some left over ice and snow roofing shield and we put that down wherever Al contact was. Buddy used 3/4"" PT last year for his StarCraft rebuild as he had it on hand. It will outlive him if he keeps it dry."
