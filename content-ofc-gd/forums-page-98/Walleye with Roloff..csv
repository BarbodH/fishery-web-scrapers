Got out with my best friend and fishing buddy Roloff the other evening for a couple of hours, nice to have the pup along now its warming up.  Got some walleye and a few pike to bite, great way to spend an evening.  "

LOL   Ah man, don't think its gonna happen this year, ice is pretty sketchy now, last time I went to my whitefish lake there was a pressure crack running shore to shore, had to cross it, there was open water there a week ago, no way Im venturing out there now."
