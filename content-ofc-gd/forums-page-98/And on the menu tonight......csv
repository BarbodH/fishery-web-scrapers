998782,Big Cliff,2017-04-01 18:07:00,6899,So tonight's menu is: Cod cakes done with a recipe from a friends Nan. Scrunch ions (not sure of the spelling but it's phonetic LOL) (needed some pork fat to fry the cod cakes so why not). French fried onions (my own recipe) and savory cabbage (didn't have a recipe so I googled one).  What are you cooking?    
998784,misfish,2017-04-01 18:15:00,29133,"Is that savory, or suppose to be savoy cabbage Cliff ?  Simple chicken club houses tonight, but Sunday will be a Virgina ham and all the fix,ns.  Easy on those scrunchns,  ENJOY"

Chardonnay in the fridge now chilling to have with it. Watching the grandkids until my daughter gets off work at 5. A whole day running around outside with the kids. Grandpa and Grandma will probably be passed out in bed by 9.  Life is good.

They had a good 10 or 12 'jersey' wearing folks talking products.  Someone brought the CTC Lindsay wrapped Stratos to the front doors for the event (a very nice looking ride too I will add).  The owner also own's a Boston Pizza too so free pizza too.  The kids and I weren't there long as my daughters not feeling well today but we got to have a peek at things and some good deals and enter the free draw for gear.  Sorry for the hijack there Cliff..."

Well I learned a couple of things:  1 lb of salt cot and 4 good size baking potatoes and two onions makes enough fish cakes  to feed about 6 hungry people (or 8 seniors LOL)  You can never have too many scrunch ions  I should have been born on the East coast  Man those are some mighty fine eats and all made from something so simple.  Thanks for the recipe my friend, it has now been added to one of Grandpa's favorites!"
