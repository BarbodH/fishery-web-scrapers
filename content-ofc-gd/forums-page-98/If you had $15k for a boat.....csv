I sold my other boat for a little less than I had hoped but now that it's gone I can get serious about finding a new one.  Quick question about trolling motors, minn kota in particular. One of the boats I'm seriously considering would require a new trolling motor and I'm not sure what I would go with. I had a powerdrive v2 55lb on my old tracker and it was great so I'm considering the Terrova (70lb or bigger) but should I spend the extra bucks and get ipilot? Or could I save it and get the ipilot add-on later on? Any thoughts on the universal sonar and would I need a newer humminbird GPS to use ipilot properly?  Lots of questions but everyone here has been a big help so far, hope you don't mind me asking for a little more.  Thanks,  FF17"

Most of the time fine tho!  The Terrova 80 24V with AP / US for this boat had solid balls to get it around and I'd think it fine on a heavier 17 consoled boat too.  Save the few extra bucks and put it into your sonar."

997086,grimsbylander,2017-03-15 21:12:00,3016,"Personally, all I want is spot-lock. But hey, we're all different. As far as the lbs and volts, that gets decided after you find a boat. The weight of the boat only plays a part in determining how strong a motor you need. A boat with a high gunnel, or fishing current or big water will require a stronger motor. Also, if you're on the pedal a lot (like me) having the extra motor or even 36V is a bonus."
997092,MSBruno,2017-03-15 21:36:00,369,Autopilot is amazing.  Will never buy another trolling motor without it.

I added the Co-Pilot wireless module and it's pretty much all I use now. Don't think I've used the foot pedal since I added that. I would really love iPilot just for the virtual anchor when jigging.

If you are weaving around stumps while you cast for bass, then a cable steer motor will give you better control than a power steer model.  If you tend to troll or fish deeper open water then the autopilot does offer a lot of advantages.  I wouldn't want to own a power steer motor that didn't have some type of autopilot.  As mentioned, a cable steer motor gives much better control; but autopilot provides a lot of benefits that (depending on what type of fishing you do) may outway the better control offered by a cable steer motor.  Personally, I troll a lot and use my bow mount to steer the boat.  So, for me it was a decision between MK iPilot and MG Xi5.  But everybody's needs are different.  "

997172,FishFinder17,2017-03-16 21:55:00,139,"All good points, thanks guys.  The whole idea behind buying a bigger boat is to have the option to fish bigger water, so the ipilot seems to make a lot of sense.

My boat is primarily for fishing, and I fish anywhere from the Great Lakes to local reservoirs.

They have a ton of US listings, most around Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio. There are a few good deals even with conversion, but right now is the wrong time to buy.

By default any tablet will hook up to a signal though and give you splitscreen sonar + maps.  Where it really shines in my opinion, is when you take it to an uncharted lake. The unit will chart it for you, on the go. Super useful for back lakes. That's a feature you only get on $1000+ units.  Don't need to spend $1000+ in  order to do maps on the fly. The 5"" version of my new finder will do it for $449US. You can also get it with Canadian lake charts.

With the exchange rate inflating the prices of new boats (well, everything for that matter), people are now starting to realize that their used boats have gone up in value as well.  Contrary to what some here believe, Tracker isn't a terrible name. I'll agree that you would be better off in a Lund, Crestliner or Princecraft but a tracker setup properly will get you on the water no problems. I've had my 06 for 7 years now and it has served me well. It's in need of some TLC which I plan on taking care of soon but I can't complain at all."
995282,John Bacon,2017-02-23 14:19:00,3277," Contrary to what some here believe, Tracker isn't a terrible name.  Yeah, the name is fine; it's the boats that are the problem  Specifically, they have reputation for cracked halls.  Many people refer to them as ""Cracker"" boats."
995299,grimsbylander,2017-02-23 17:44:00,3016,"You just need to make sure you address everything you need from a boat and decide if you can live with the repercussions of owning that particular boat. Example... a glass boat will give you a superior ride and as a bass boat, greater stability over aluminum...however, what is your tow vehicle? Are the ramps on the smaller lakes in good shape? Are you the drag the boat up on shore for lunch kind of guy? Are you willing to wipe down and polish your boat? If not, go get an aluminum. Do you like trolling? Don't get a bass boat. etc...etc.  I will also recommend looking at the US market. In fact, I cannot ever see myself buying a used boat in Canada. I see what some guys spend on a 16' tinner with a 50hp up here and and I'm shocked. To each their own but make sure after you've decided exactly what you want, go shopping in the US as a comparison and learn the steps to import a boat."
995313,Tjames09,2017-02-23 19:32:00,664,when you guys say check the US market. Where exactly are you checking?
995335,DRIFTER_016,2017-02-23 22:36:00,10439,when you guys say check the US market. Where exactly are you checking?  Craigslist is great for boats. Pick a state and have fun.  There are other local sites that are area specific I follow Alaska and a Florida based ones.  There are a bunch of fishing/boating for sale pages on Facebook too. This is one I belong to.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/fishing4sale/

To be honest I hadn't even considered buying a boat in the US until the many suggestions that I do so. I've bought and sold 5 or 6 boats but have never ventured into the US market for any of them. I live in Mississauga so I'm not too far from the border and could make the drive to either Michigan or NY. I'm still pretty surprised that there are good deals to be had given the exchange rate. I'll have to do some looking to see what's out there.  Thanks again for all of the comments and suggestions. Based on what's been said I know: -My preference is to go aluminum since it's going to spend most of it's time on a smaller lake and will be towed with a Mazda CX-5 to the bigger lakes -Better off in a Lund, Princecraft, or Crestliner vs Tracker (even though I just sold a 26 year old Tracker that treated me well lol) -Could be better deals in the US -It's still pretty early for GTA/Ontario listings but prices go up once the season starts  Anything else I should know? Anyone have opinions on brands like Polar Kraft, Alumacraft, or others?  Thanks again for all the comments, tips and suggestions - big help.  FF17"

FF17  Don't worry about the exchange rate...just research the boat you want, get an idea of the Canadian pricing, then shop it out in the US and see if you can save some bucks. I bought my Ranger in Pennsylvania 5 years ago and I promise I could sell it today for more money than I paid."
995375,Lape0019,2017-02-24 13:11:00,647,Polarkraft and Alumacraft are both really good boats as well. Alumacraft really do not get the respectthey deserve. I've checked them out up close a few times and have been impressed every time.

Love seeing some of the older glass boats we never get up here like Warrior and my bucket list has a Ranger 619 or 620 on it one day.  It's been mentioned before but the value of used boats has risen significantly in the last 3-4 years. Partly due to exchange rate but also due to ever increasing $ of a brand new boat. I bought my crestliner 1 year old used in 2002 and the resale value on that boat today is around 2-3K less than I paid back then. My boat has basically depreciated about $200 a year - not bad!

995108,FishFinder17,2017-02-22 03:19:00,139,"Would love to get the opinion of some of the members as I know there is a lot of boat knowledge around here.  This spring I am in the market for a new fishing boat and my budget is around $15,000. I'm looking for something 17ft or bigger with at least a 90hp outboard. Ideally it would be an aluminum walk through (Lund, Crestliner, Tracker, etc) but I'm also considering a bass boat. The boat would spend the majority of its time on a smaller lake but I would like it to be capable of handling lakes like Simcoe, Muskokas, Kawarthas, etc for day trips. I often fish with 3 others so I'm hoping I can find a boat that will accommodate that. Trolling motor and finders are a must so if I have to buy/upgrade I will factor that into the price. Hoping to find something 2004 or newer.  I'm wondering what you would buy if you were in my position? I'm going to be buying used so are there brands I should stay away from? or any I should look for? Would you recommend a bass boat or aluminum and why?  Any help would be appreciated. I know I may have to sacrifice some areas of my wish list given my budget but hoping not too much. It's a big purchase and I want to make sure I buy the right boat so it spends more time on the water than in the repair shop.  Thanks,  FF17    "
995111,Pigeontroller,2017-02-22 04:02:00,2793,I'd say take your time and wait for something you really like.
995116,GBW,2017-02-22 05:41:00,8460,"How soon do you need to ""pull the trigger"" on this purchase?  Boats always go for top $ at the start of the season but a LOT less at the end as people don't want to pay for storage and so on like winter prep. maint.  So with that said, 4 people in a boat you just ruled out most bass boats as all the ones I've been in (some were big too) are 3 seat's and not a ton of fishing/standing room for more than 2 people.  Glass boats are heavy (towing) but a nice ride.  Tin's are light but some are not so nice in waves/chop at speed.  So, ask yourself what is it used for daily (when in use 90% of the time) vs the odd ""let's go tube'n"" type day.  We all have a brand we like and don't so you are going to get mixed reviews there no doubt.  Also hull design... Good luck and wait for what you want is the best answer I can say.  Don't rush this purchase if you can wait to find YOUR ideal boat at YOUR budget."

995137,mistaredone,2017-02-22 13:51:00,913,"The used market sucks right now. I've been looking with no luck. My first boat I went with a bass boat contrary to advise I got here. 7 years later I'm looking for my next boat and it will be a deep v walk through to take advantage of the Great Lakes close by. My advise is don't rush your decision, get the motor pressure tested, take it for a water test drive,leave room in the budget for tune up, bearing replacement for the trailer, extra hull plugs lol. USA seems the best place to buy right now just for variety reason. Good luck. Exciting times"
995141,Sterling,2017-02-22 13:56:00,477,"At $15k the biggest you'll want to go is 17ft, yes.  You may need to sacrifice engine size. A 60hp can easily move a 17 footer, so consider that.  BUY USED. The US dollar is strong right now, so if you buy new it will be at a massive premium. People like to sell their boats based on what they paid (previously), so you can get some deals there. They forget to factor in the value of their boat now that the US dollar is so strong.  Another place you can save is by going with a tablet + navionics setup which will cost you around $400 for everything and give you all the features of a fancy unit, including bathymetric maps on the fly which only the Onix units can do (and I believe maybe 1-2 other units)."

995143,firebird,2017-02-22 14:08:00,39,"Id go aluminium all day. You say small lakes and the 2 bigger ones you listed are rocky. Aluminium doesn't take a structural beating from the sun. Rivets are easier to replace then stressed fibreglass. And I believe aluminium boats are lighter than fibreglass, I know smaller boats for sure.  So if your dealing with rocks,logs, shallow water, and want the boat forever Id buy aluminium. (sounds like it with the lakes you listed)  On the other hand fibreglass is quieter, and IMO handles rough water better, but I mean the great lakes."

I think it's a waste to just run the maps, unless you're cruising and not fishing. By default any tablet will hook up to a signal though and give you splitscreen sonar + maps.  Where it really shines in my opinion, is when you take it to an uncharted lake. The unit will chart it for you, on the go. Super useful for back lakes. That's a feature you only get on $1000+ units."
995150,Brettiop,2017-02-22 14:52:00,279,"Go look at boats, lots of them, you will quickly learn what kinds you like.  You can find a 2000-2005 lund/crestliner/pricecraft from 10-15k that will suit your need and last for years...."
995155,Raf,2017-02-22 15:20:00,3495,"when you say fishing 4 people regularly, are we talking 4 adults tossing baits.. or?? You're gonna need a bigger boat (and budget) than a typical 16-17' if that is the case."
995164,porkpie,2017-02-22 15:43:00,2521,"I cruise with 3 adults and 3 kids in a 16 Lund with a 50.  I'm not winning any races, but it works.  My boat is primarily for fishing, and I fish anywhere from the Great Lakes to local reservoirs.  I can't fish in any weather on the big lakes, but in my experience when it's too rough for my boat I don't enjoy the fishing as much these days.  When I was younger the weather wouldn't stop me.  As other guys said, your not comfortably fishing 4 from a 17 footer.  I can troll and jig with 3.  If we are casting, 2 is max.  There is a Facebook site called walleye boats for sale.  They have a ton of US listings, most around Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio.  There are a few good deals even with conversion, but right now is the wrong time to buy.  You should be able to get a decent aluminum for your budget.  Stay away from tracker, and if your really into multi species a bass boat is probably not for you."
995165,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-22 15:51:00,8243,"If you see a Tracker run away as fast as you can they are garbage cans.  Lund and StarCraft are my favorite boats. I would take a Crestliner but I am not a fan of welded hulls. Whatever you choose it all about the condition of the boat. For 15K you are looking at a 15 year old boat for what you want, maybe older. People with good boats generally keep them. I saw plenty of junk when I was looking."

That layout is typically 2 seaters with front and back casting deck. Smaller boats in the 17ft range are very tight with 2 adults up on the deck  You will get more bang for your buck with a tiller model too.  very nice crestliner fishhawk 1750 w/90Hp on Walleye Central for $11.5K USD- It's a 2001 in Wisconsin and comes with all electronics, trolling motor and a 9.9 kicker.

Good luck, I havent had any yet, but it is really early.   Ya I definitely still think it's early as most people still have their boat in storage.  For reference I bought a 1989 16ft tracker with the original 30hp johnson 4 years ago. It was on Kijiji for $5000 and I got it for $3500 because the guy had already bought a new boat and his payment was coming up. I did a bit of work to it over the years (new throttle, casting deck, electronics..maybe $1200 all in) and it served me really well for a 26 year old boat.  I sold the boat this fall for $6000 which is $2500 more than I paid for it and $1300 more than I had invested after 4 years of using it. My point is no one knows how much a used boat is worth - they just know how much they want for it/are willing to pay for it. Plus everyone has different circumstances that can cause them to change their price.  I'm just hoping I can find the right boat for the right price. From my experience a little hard work and hustle on Kijiji can pay off."
