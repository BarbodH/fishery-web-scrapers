Theres two rivers Im looking at, but the rivers are massive, and not sure where on the river I should go. Close to the main lake or way in land.  Not sure anyone will help with this, I know people are really fussy with trout advice."
999337,Ralph Field,2017-04-05 22:39:00,1018,Once they decide it is time to run the river they will go up river until they find prime spawning grounds.

Like said, once they are on the move, they are on their way up the river. Been a real funky winter, and have found there are fresh runs still heading up. The past few years, the trout have been way up and settled in way before norm. Thats up here though. I have lost track of how the southern tribs have been, as I dont fish them any more.  One real important note here. Make sure you know how far you can go up the system. Again, I dont follow the new and old rules down that way. You dont want to be fishing in a out of season section.  As for how far?????????  Credit river mouth, up to Norval. Google it and see the many miles they will travel."

999342,GBW,2017-04-05 23:22:00,8460,I found them in the run off areas (drainage ditch basically) when I lived in Brooklin North of the dam there that didn't have a 'lift' so they have a will and they have a way...
999343,BillM,2017-04-05 23:24:00,17367,"Make sure the season is open before you start fishing    You'll get fresh fish, drop backs and ones that are hanging out in the estuary water.  They'll be all over the place."

I'll give you an example, fish from the Notty will make their way up to the Pine as far as HWY 24!  They will find a way.  Thanks, Thats one of the rivers I was looking at. Not the pine though."

Opener is the fourth Saturday in April.  As to your question, you could have lazy fish spawning in the first run up from the lake and at the same time have fish so far up the same system that they run out of water."

As to your question, you could have lazy fish spawning in the first run up from the lake and at the same time have fish so far up the same system that they run out of water.  Thanks, you are correct, it is the fourth. Notty is open year round for rainbow trout though, which was where I was looking."
999395,dave524,2017-04-06 11:23:00,4508,"A lot of fall run fish actually overwinter and spawn in early spring, they are where you find them, you need to put boots on the ground. With this downpour  of a few days ago they could be way upstream."
999412,Garnet,2017-04-06 13:08:00,2056,"The fun is the discovery.  Pick a spot get on the river look around and say if I where a trout that's the spot. Then you make adjustment maybe larger float, back spot and you stick one.  That's the fun."
