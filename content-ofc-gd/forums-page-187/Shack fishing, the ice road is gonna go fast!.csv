The ice road is going to take a beating. Will be looking to get my shack off this week. There is still plenty of ice, over 4 feet at my shack, but the road will become rutted and slushy with deep water in no time, not for the faint hearted traveller(or the smart one).  I only put the shack out at the end of January but it has been a regular hang out for the whole family and a gathering place for friends too, very awesome little shack! Its great to pick Jack up from school and head straight there, especially when the fish are biting, nothing big, but enough to have got Jack excited about ice fishing, JOB DONE!  My new frying pan also added to the fun, with the almighty 'Shack BLT' making its debut.          THE ROAD IS GONNA MELT FAST             STILL ENOUGH ICE FOR A CAR PARK              JACK LANDED A PERCH BEFORE WE WERE EVEN SET UP!               JACK KNOWS THE ROUTINE AND GETS STUCK IN TO SETTING UP                    AFTER SET UP JACK WANTED TO MARK THE SHACK ON THE GPS. HE SPELLED OUT THE DETAILS ALL BY HIMSELF, ALL THAT GEOCACHING PAID DIVIDENDS!                         JACK THEN PROCEEDED TO PUT ON A WALLEYE AND SAUGER CATCHING DEMONSTRATION                     MUM JOINED US AFTER WORK FOR A 'SHACK BLT' AND POPCORN SUPPER                      THEN BACK TO JACK'S FISHING CLINIC         "

LOL…he hates wearing sunglasses, his eyelashes are really, really, long and touch the front of the lenses.   Awesome pix & great video.  I like Jack's ""hand hold"" !  The blue snow shovel!  Hilarious!  LOL…he has a pair of black gloves in the shack, but they were slimed and frozen stiff, he opted for the shovel."
