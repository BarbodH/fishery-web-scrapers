903635,chris.brock,2015-03-14 22:22:00,4053,"Does anyone have experience with this stuff?  It's made in Canada, that's a good sign.  The material looked a little better on the Viking than my Costco Wetskins stuff.  This is how cheap I am. There's 2 Viking jackets at Value Village for $10 each, and I didn't pull the trigger before asking you guys. Probably cost me more in gas to get back there. Hahaha"
903637,lew,2015-03-14 22:26:00,12766,"Don't know anything about them Chris, but I'd imagine wearing a $10 rain jacket from Value Village would be like sitting in a sauna on a hot day.  Good quality breathable rain wear is worth spending the $$$$ for IMHO"
903638,misfish,2015-03-14 22:28:00,29133,"I have owned the Viking suit. It,s a good suit,but like Lew said."
903639,solopaddler,2015-03-14 22:28:00,8605,Spend the money on something good!
903640,misfish,2015-03-14 22:30:00,29133,Spend the money on something good!  And this guy too.^^^^^
903643,chris.brock,2015-03-14 22:35:00,4053,"  thanks guys   Hahaha, we talked about this before.  Give me the heads up if you see the BPS stuff on sale this spring"
903648,wormdunker,2015-03-14 23:02:00,1711,I own a Viking suit which I've used for many years.  It's ok.  For 10 bux I would not hesitate.  Even if you just keep it on the boat for a spare.
903659,manitoubass2,2015-03-14 23:49:00,11391,I hate mine.  I switched last year to stormtech( gift from my dad) and its wicked good
903675,mike rousseau,2015-03-15 01:04:00,4661,I've had a viking jacket from marks work warehouse for like 10 years... Nothing but good things to say... It was on sale for $50 I think
903680,Moosebunk,2015-03-15 01:16:00,3970,"Good question to ask.  Buddy of mine guided for months out of the ""rubberized"" rain suit by Viking and although he says you can cook in that gear some summer days, if it's warm outside it doesn't matter if you're getting a little wet anyways.  I'd be looking for a full suit just to go over my other during the total downpours.  Over the years, keeping extra lightweight suits has been great too.  Leave 'em in the boat for others or, if it's really coming down pull some rain bibs up over the rain pants and another rain jacket over a rain jacket and you're staying well dry."
903682,grizzlybri,2015-03-15 01:24:00,565,"i have both a vikings jacket and bibed pants and love them, in fact i also have a pair of the viking chainsaw boots also.  Both of which the pants and boots came in extremely helpful today"
903692,danc,2015-03-15 03:00:00,4677,"I have a full Viking two piece rain suit. It keeps me dry. That's all that I ask of it, so no complaints. And it catches fish too.. Breathabilty might be more of an issue for you southern Ontario boys than it is for me. I'm usually struggling to retain every bit of heat that I can.  "
903694,Jds63,2015-03-15 03:04:00,1365,"I have Viking rain pants , they have kept me dry , used them on the the Windsor Lake trip and it rained a lot that week"
903695,Sinker,2015-03-15 03:04:00,8692,"The rain gear my work supplies is Viking. Its not bad. It doesnt breathe well at all, but keeps ya fairly dry.  S."
903699,manitoubass2,2015-03-15 03:28:00,11391,My stormtech gear is unreal for rainy cold conditions.  My viking I do like for beginning of the ice fishing season.  it just doesnt breath and you sweat way to much.  of course thats just my gear. They make other stuff as well.
