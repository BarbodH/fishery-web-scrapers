903533,Musky or Specks,2015-03-14 13:11:00,2710,I have never paid for an eye exam due to Diabetes until 2 weeks ago. The test to look deep to the optic nerve cost me 40 bucks. I was going to question that one but don't want to spend 3 days trying to get to talk to a human being. That test is to save the optometrist time and should be free. It can be done without the machine required but takes a lot more time.

He told me that his family premiums were up to $1200.00 per month and he could no longer afford it.  as stated above he can afford to go to a NASCAR race for the weekend but can not afford health insurance, it is all about choices people make."

It might be that simple under Obama care but in the past it really didn't matter when you started or what you paid, because if you got really sick. Your needs could max out your policy. Worse if you were sick enough you were gone from your job (exactly like lots of people I know in Canada too). So you get well in the US and you start a new job, but not that long ago there with a PRE-EXISTING condition you might not be insurable at any price...  Also there is NO mathematical logic, that can be used to infer that prices for anything in Canada are higher because of Healthcare. Healthcare costs MORE as a percentage of GDP in the US and has for decades, so we are paying more up here for a different reason. In the end the citizens in both countries pay for healthcare and it is MORE expensive in the US, that fact can't be disputed.  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.TOTL.ZS"
903203,Mister G,2015-03-13 08:07:00,1429,"Note the last thing I said Mister G... I've lived my life since the age of 24, to at least 44, in the 50% tax bracket so yes I certainly paid my dues to our great government  and indeed when it comes right down to it paid for her health care out of my pocket and then some. All in all, I'd be living on the street if I again had to fork out the past 5 years expenses for her procedures. I guess you unfortunately have to live it, to understand it. I won't get too excited for your next response, while I sit here at Sunnybrook waiting for her delayed final day of full brain radiation. I'm sorry if your offended by my response, but I thought you would know better and you do that we all pay either now or later. That was my point. Some of our younger anglers here I don't think understand that. Some think, it's free because the government gave you something. If those anglers could only go back 20-30 years and see things haven't gotten better, but they sure have gotten more expensive."
903254,bigugli,2015-03-13 13:30:00,6138,"I've tried staying out of this one. It evokes too much emotional response.        i've seen both the good and the shortcomings of the Ontario system, and hands down I'll take Ontario. When my daughter was a toddler she was misdiagnosed and lost in the system shuffle up at Mac. According to the treating physician ""She's a toddler. What does she really know about pain. She says she hurts so she can have attention"" The Shriners came to the rescue and got her into one of their units for treatment. If not for them she would have died a long time back. The first spinal repair cost close to a quarter million back in the 90's. If I had to pay for that I would have been broke then, and never afforded the further spinal repairs that followed. You all know my wife had cancer. You want to tell me how a disabled person pays for all that treatment. They don't because they can't. Disabled people don't qualify for most life insurance or health insurance policies. The exceptions being policies negating prior illness and costing 1000 a month per person. It;s nice to hear from the ""never been sick"" ""never needed the system"" types. They will eventually get a huge heaping dish of crow. As for the well to do not wanting to subsidize the poor and needy with taxes. That has never changed in a thousand years. After all there 'no workhouses, are there no prisons"" to paraphrase Dickens. To the wealthy those who cannot work are a burden and under social Darwinism should be allowed to die to ""decrease the surplus population"" A standing conservative argument established by the Rev'd Malthus."
903276,Paudash,2015-03-13 14:56:00,273,"From my situation I would much rather go with the US system but I am very lucky to be in the 50% tax bracket and could afford full heath coverage in the states if we had that system.  What people do not realise is the US system is very good and affordable if you start your insurance at a young age and not in you 40's when health issues usally start.  It is similar to people here being able to retire at age of 50 because they started RRSP's age 20 not 40 like the majority of people.  Everyone has good and bad stories from the 2 systems but our system has failed my daughter and I have been paying over $20000.00 a year for the past 5 years that our government will not even let me claim against my taxes for the drugs she requires that are all fully available here in Canada, but we have to purchase them in states or buy them with US prescriptions from internet pharmacy's."

I also would support a two tear health care if it was available and if it opened up the opportunity for faster / easier availability for treatment .  John"
903292,bigugli,2015-03-13 16:02:00,6138,"Oh yes the two tier system. The white country club hospital vs ""county"" for the rest. If you think the statement is racist, yes it is. Every year at the nursing job fairs, big private hospitals in the states come to Canada to hire lots of Canadian nurses. White nurses. Spent enough years in health/nursing admin to know a lot on the subject. Many an Ontario nurse goes down with a contract job with bonuses and all the hours they can handle, sometimes more. 2-3 years down there and they came come home with a fat bank acct. If you have money you go to private hospitals and wait for nothing. If not, the waiting lists in Ontario are nothing compared to a county hospital in many a US city."
903316,Paudash,2015-03-13 17:16:00,273,"Flex Rod,  It is the same because if the doctors here were treating her the drugs would be covered by my work insurance but because they are US doctors they are not valid in Ontario and not accepted by Ontario pharmacies.

One thing I love here is that I can converse with my dr over the phone, or get in within a day or two to see him.  An hour east you cant talk to your dr, and just to get in a clinic is over a month wait.  Again I think we have a great system here but improvements can be made.  My dr even shows me prices of meds to help reduce the cost. I pay up front but my coverage covers that cost once submitted.  Im just curious how service varies in different areas of ontario  Also, at the local drug store, all the meds are generic, good and bad come with that i spose"

But to spread false hearsay info is only making matters worse.  Sorry but they are not accusations they are facts!!!! Maybe with Obama care they wouldn't have wound up bankrupt or lost their coverage , but before Obama care when it all happened they most certainly would have lost their insurance and had to pay themselves. In all the cases they would have COLLAPSED their work coverage, or gone without any coverage after being laid off when the job they had for 20 plus years with excellent benefits went offshore...  Since you can't ignore going for care or just take aspirin when you have fatal cancer in 5 of the cases, they required a lot of very expensive care.  Also there is no way any county hospital in the US would have treated them for free as they weren't destitute. They had homes to sell to satisfy the debt. Which is WHAT was happening to lots of people in the US at the time. Look up the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the US of A and will you find it says medical costs.  As for the myth anyone can get care in the US at a County Hospital because they can't refuse to treat you, that is only true if you need emergency care, once you are stable they no longer have to treat you. Also if you have the means to pay you eventually pay whatever you can.  There is nothing false in what I wrote and I stand by it fully. Also, since you don't know all the facts maybe you shouldn't be so quick to condemn it as heresay."

She went from being an elite athlete to being wheelchair bound in a matter of 3 months.  She was given 4-5 MRI's in the first 2-3 months but when they could not find a diagnosis they pushed everything out further and further and we went from doctor to doctor from Ottawa to Kitchener until a doctor told us to go to the states.  As soon as they they found out she played hockey they kept saying she has a concussion and refused to look past it even though she never suffered a major hit.   The Ontario system is set up like a menu, this is what the test shows so this is what you have.  What if the test do no show anything conclusive, they push you to the next doctor.  Your vet can treat your dog off of symptoms but Ontario doctors are not allowed to."

That would normally end the conversation. While our system isn't perfect it is pretty darn good."

903165,ch312,2015-03-13 00:58:00,1590,sort of like paying $12.00 to park at the hospital for 30 minutes in order to pay $35.00 for a MRI that a specialist at another hospital ask to see.  great system as long as you don't need it  You'd rather have taxes increased for every working person in the province to cover the cost of building and maintaining parking lots instead of just paying $12 the odd time you go? It's far cheaper for all of us for everyone to pay for their own parking.  The first search result on Google for a private MRI in Canada shows prices start at $895 and go up to $2450. Is $35 really too much to ask when most hospitals are already strapped for cash?  http://www.canmagnetic.com/scans-rates/
903184,Paudash,2015-03-13 02:27:00,273,"Sorry to say but I would much rather go with the system pay for what you use instead of the crazy tax rate we pay.  As our system is you pay unreal tax rates and get horrible service, in the states if you need to see a doctor you call them and see them that day, you need to see a specialist you call them and see the next week, no referrals just pick up the phone and make an appointment.  I speak from experience of having a very sick child and having her be lost in this system so I take her to the states for treatment.  Our system is fine for a cut or broken bone but when you are really sick with something that is not on our medical menu then you will see how terrible it is.  Yes the MRI may cost between $1000-$2500 in Canada but you need to wait 2-3 months and in the States it cost $500.00 if you want to wait a week or $1000 next day.  sorry for the rant but I speak from the experience of a sick child that our system failed  and continues to fail, so we are forced to seek a medical treatment in the States and have never been charged for parking at a doctors office or an hospital in the States.  Also when the MRI is done in the States they ask which doctors you want it sent to in Canada or the States and then they give you the DVD that you can give to any future doctor that can be copied as well.  The DVD you pick up here can only be used once and not copied."

We've never paid more than 10 bucks and there have been numerous.. some have been free... I have every one of Jen's MRI's on my computer and probably why I only have 58kb of memory left. We copy every one of them, they are not a single use product.  Americans pay income taxes as well.. they don't ride for free and then they also have to either pay for their procedures or carry medical insurance. It all probably rounds out in the end.  Sorry to hear your child has been lost in the system... Jen was for well over a year, probably why she's gone through what she has for 5+ years as things progressed too far before treatment.  One thing I tell every friend I have with small children.. DO NOT FORGET.... you DO NOT need a referral to take your child to Sick Kids in Toronto, or London.. or Ottawa. That is a total Myth. Just show up at Emerg when you've had enough of your family doctor!"
