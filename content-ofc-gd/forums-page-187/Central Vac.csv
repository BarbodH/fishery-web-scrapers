I used to have Cana-Vac, which is ok, but I would like to get any advices what might be better, quieter and best place to buy it from. I would really appreciate any help in this matter.  thanks"
902866,Gerritt,2015-03-11 15:03:00,6129,"Get a Beam, not knowing where u are moving I would suggest Amazon.ca or a local shop..  You can quiet the unit with a ""muffler"" or vent the exhaust outside.  Dual voltage? Or low?  G"
902877,Cosmos,2015-03-11 15:45:00,588,I prefer to get it local with installation as well. What does it mean dual voltage or low? My old one seats in garage connected to regular power outlet I guess.
902885,captpierre,2015-03-11 16:30:00,2521,I hear Beam is not near as good as it used to be. Made in Asia. Needed to have our circuit board replaced twice already. I'm told Canavac is the way to go.
902887,Mike Pike,2015-03-11 16:37:00,1332,"I've had a central vac system and, honestly, I think a good ol' fashioned vacuum cleaner is better, handier and less of a pain.  Hauling around that central vac hose and plugging it in here and there is more trouble than an ordinary vacuum, imho.  Good luck on your search though, Costa, if you do go that route."
902939,Fishwilly,2015-03-11 22:21:00,206,Canavac is the cat's meow. Built in Ontario and like a tank. The motor is twice the size of the other guys.
902947,Cosmos,2015-03-11 22:48:00,588,Thank you guys.
902964,icefisherman,2015-03-11 23:50:00,952,"Costa,  I did lot of research some years ago and went with CanaVac at the end. Based on reviews and now on own experience they are simply the best out there. Bought it from a guy in Kitchener and then send some of my firneds there so they bought from the same place as well.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
902975,Cosmos,2015-03-12 00:49:00,588,"Thank you Emil,  I do have CanaVac right now. Bought it 4 years ago from Vacmaster in markham. This place is  awesome, custom service is the best. They helped me out couple time by replacing CAnaVac parts free of charge. Last month my power head gave up, so they fixed for $80. Closest vac place to me wanted to charge me 4150 for same work. I am looking for second opinion on those central vacs. For now I am still thinking to get with new model of Canavac."
902979,gino,2015-03-12 01:05:00,400,"had Kenmore for years, bought from Sears, worked very good, sold the house and i believe the owner still use the same unit right now. very quite and it was installed in garage, barely heard the unit running, only noise came from powered head unit"
903022,wormdunker,2015-03-12 07:54:00,1711,I've had Can Vac for over 30 years.  Same unit no problems except the beater bar.  Had to replace it after 20 years.  The so called new (now 10 years old) beater bar is still working fine.
903045,Shloim,2015-03-12 12:59:00,515,"This is right up my Alley! My parents have had a beam for 20+ years and they've been awesome. However we bought a hoover at Costco that came with all sorts of goodies, it lasted 4 years and I believe we are responsible for it dying. However with that being said we returned it without question after 39 months and got another. Hard to beat that..."
