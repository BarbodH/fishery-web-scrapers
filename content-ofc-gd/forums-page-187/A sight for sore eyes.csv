902650,wormdunker,2015-03-10 07:21:00,1711,Mr. Ironmaker.  How do you know it's 3 miles?  Ha Ha!  Couldn't resist!  You sure it's not 4??
902655,spincast,2015-03-10 09:55:00,3279,"Warmer weather means I'm installing my new sonar this week.  Can't wait! Me too - bot a new HDS7 to install, and move the 5 up to the bow, then a few more upgrades before we head out for some spring Lake O specialties - can't wait. If this weather holds, the boat will be coming home on the weekend  I was out there today Great day for it - did you happen to see the Launch? if so, how are the conditions?  No open water shots yet please.  Still looking forward to a winter here. I think you're safe up your way for a bit longer MB. Just send any warm air you don't want our way - St. Catherines is good"
902656,dave524,2015-03-10 10:01:00,4508,"There appears to be a strip of open water 3 miles from shore here on Erie.  I saw on another from an icebreaker went from Port Colborne to Fort Erie, a couple of days ago. Lake Ontario looks to be totally open across to TO except for the mounds the wind has pushed up here around the pier and the mouth of the Forty.  Oops : I know you are west of there but he probably cleared the mouth of the Grand for flood control purposes, they usually do and came from points further west."
902693,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-10 16:04:00,8243,"I may have missed the ice breaker going by because the gap is closed this AM.  Wormdunker, there is a quick formula to determine how far off shore something is based on how far above the shoreline you are."

902702,mr blizzard,2015-03-10 17:29:00,1589,"No open water shots yet please.  Still looking forward to a winter here. I am with Moosebunk, pulled some rib muscles 2 months ago, still cant use gas auger to drill some holes to start my ice fishing season"
