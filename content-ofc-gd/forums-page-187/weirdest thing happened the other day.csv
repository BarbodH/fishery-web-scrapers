903193,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-13 03:08:00,10439,"So the wife and I are walking to get into Walmart, and halfway through the crosswalk in front of Walmart doors, a young lady driving a mazda zooms though the crosswalk going at least 20+ kms and literally within a few feet of us.   I am not the type to make a big deal of things like this, but I did make sure to stare at the car as it drove off just so that she realized her mistake  . Guess what happens next?!? After driving off for about 50 or so feet, she rolls down the window and gives us the finger!!  At that moment we kind of laughed it off, but in all seriousness, to do something that wreckless and to top it off with that  .  What would you guys do if that happened to you?  There are more than a few vehicles running around with my boot print on them because they did that."
903209,Big Cliff,2015-03-13 11:18:00,6899,"Driving out our road the other day, there is a car in the ditch on the left side of the road pointing toward us so I stopped. The young lady told me her phone rang so she pulled off the road to do the right thing and answer it, her wheel got caught on the sholder and pulled her into the ditch. Ok, so you pull over on the left side of the road to answer your phone??????  I could have pulled her out easily but I thought ""first, there is no way you pulled over to answer your phone, you were either texting or talking while driving and second you just lied to me about it""! I just smiled and said ""you lie, call a tow truck"" and I drove away."
903210,spincast,2015-03-13 11:27:00,3279,I think they found the rest of her family in Sk on the way to the store http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mounties-stop-speeding-pickup-with-17-people-aboard-1.2992321

903002,mike rousseau,2015-03-12 03:18:00,4661,Slash her tires after she parks... Jk
903004,Muskieman,2015-03-12 03:47:00,2472,Take a few pictures and post it to social media . 
903005,chris.brock,2015-03-12 03:48:00,4053,That's nothing out of the ordinary here in Jokeville Ontario
903009,manitoubass2,2015-03-12 04:46:00,11391,Seems to be the new way of justice lol
903011,Joey,2015-03-12 04:58:00,9122,Slash her tires after she parks... Jk  I'd say not kidding
903013,c10,2015-03-12 05:10:00,131,"I worked at Costco for six years, I got used to almost getting crushed by cars daily while I was outside lol. I probably would have just looked at her and shook my head, people like that don't seem to learn and there's no point in making a big deal out of it ahahaha"
903031,moxie,2015-03-12 10:09:00,1566," Ya , Public shaming via social media. Slacktivism. I like the slash tire method but i carry a tire valve tool instead. And always remember to hit at least 2 of the tires."
903035,Yellow Fever,2015-03-12 11:19:00,139,Is it just me? I have had this happen to me and its ALWAYS a young woman
903037,Fishwilly,2015-03-12 11:35:00,206,Bet she wasn't paying attention cause she was probably texting. I swear I see tons of people texting and driving every day....most of them young women. ARghhhhhhh!!!
903040,Steelheadphycho,2015-03-12 12:32:00,470,Id jump in front of her and let her hit me then I'd take over ownership of her life............   People suck!
903042,Steelheadphycho,2015-03-12 12:41:00,470,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Ok, maybe I wouldn go that far........."
903043,AKRISONER,2015-03-12 12:48:00,5558,stupidity is rampant in society. I wouldn't let it get to you.
903049,Beavertail,2015-03-12 13:04:00,331,"Nothing you can do about it, except flip her the bird in return if it makes you feel better. In her mind you were at fault...there are many ignorant, stupid, careless drivers out there. I just assume everyone sucks at driving now and I'm super alert and defensive whether driving, walking or riding my bike. I sure don't trust some painted hash marks on the pavement to guarantee a safe crossing either, sad but true."
903068,Acountdeleted,2015-03-12 15:33:00,2562,Smash the windows and flip her the bird. (Jk)
903072,Steelheadphycho,2015-03-12 15:47:00,470,No truer words have ever been spoken.........
903075,Mister G,2015-03-12 15:55:00,1429,Buy a lottery ticket because it was your lucky day she didn't hit you and then stop for a shot and a beer because you just won the lottery of living. Anything after that is icing on the cake.
903076,NAW,2015-03-12 15:55:00,4022,"I saw the exact same thing happen last week at the wally in Barrie.  The lady who almost got hit grabbed a pen and paper from her purse and wrote down the plates.  But I am almost 100% sure that nothing came from it.  Sure, it would be nice to violently beat the living crap out of the driver, and leave them broken and bleeding to death in the walmart parking lot...  But you go to jail for that sort of thing."
903078,KLINKER,2015-03-12 15:57:00,256,"I'm cruising down the road and a guy pulls form a stop sign at the intersection in front of me and stops right across the road blocking both lanes. A quick jump on the brakes locks her up and 4000 lbs of big block muscle car comes screaming down at him standing on its nose. I got it stopped about a foot from his door and he gives me the finger and drives away.  I think I saved his ungrateful life, He probably thought I damn near killed him and made him crap in his pants."
903083,BillM,2015-03-12 16:10:00,17367,"Light her car on fire, that will teach her."
903087,Mike Pike,2015-03-12 16:34:00,1332,"That would infuriate me.  But any action on your part, other than just shaking your heads at her stupidity, would bring you down to her level.  I commute a couple hours to work every day.  I spend a lot of time shaking my head."
903091,manitoubass2,2015-03-12 17:06:00,11391,"Some interweb driving rage up in here hahaha.  Lots of dummies out there driving vehicles irresponsibly.  Pay attention and like bill said, light any car that almost hit you, on fire.  Have a real good lawyer on speed dial as well???"
903093,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-12 17:09:00,2582,Id jump in front of her and let her hit me then I'd take over ownership of her life............   People suck! Awesome  Thx for the laugh.
903094,davew3,2015-03-12 17:42:00,430,"I have said to my wife many times,  make eye contact with the driver.  She says if she gets hit she will sue.   I said back, if you get hit your the one in the hospital or dead,  how is suing going to fix that ?   Cars don't feel pain.   Always look,  just like when we were taught.  Idiots everywhere."
903183,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-13 02:26:00,937,Gotta be on guard every time you're crossing the road.
