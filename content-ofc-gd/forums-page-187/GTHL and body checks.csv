902526,The Urban Fisherman,2015-03-09 18:49:00,2050,"I'm Just going to say this as it refers too some peoples thoughts on A AA AAA.  Given this was about 15 years ago. Where I come from there are leagues with no contact "" house league"" and church league which has contact but also classified as ""house league"". A, AA, AAA were levels above those that would involve playing teams from other communities not other local clubs. To say that A is house league division and that there is no chance of those kids moving on to play junior is just false. Case and point in some communities A is there highest level of hockey due to participation numbers and size of there communities. Depending on the talent level of any given year you can run across a A team that has the talent level of a AAA team, I've seen it. When I was in my playing days we would run across a couple single A teams that were just flat out good, when we played there was a team from Cobourg that had a very good team and many of those players went on to play some sort of junior and some to the AHL. Now perhaps the year beneath them or above them were not as strong but that happens in every city at every level. I have played with guys who played A there whole minor league career and only till they were in major bantam - minor midget did they develop enough to play AAA and went on to have years played in the OHL. My birth year was so deep that in one year I believe minor bantam ( grade 10)  the A,AA, and AAA teams all  won all Ontario. No that's unheard of usually if the AAA team is very good the AA team may not be as strong and A even less. However perhaps in the GTA or larger communities there are more kids playing which allows the lower levels to still maintain decent teams. My belief on contact is this, if you desire for child not to participate in contact hockey, then you should consider putting them in a non-contact league, we have one here in town so I would imagine that in respectively populated city that option would be there as well. I believe there is right and wrong age to teach body contact and it never affected me negatively for the age at which I began at, I played with a lot of small guys who were very good checkers and were very difficult to hit. I always found the bigger guys were easier targets and easier to knock down then the smaller ones. Then again I wasn't wearing armour as protection either.  YES!  It's simple. ""A"" and above should have checking at the appropriate age level.  Period."

Was it when there were 7 skaters per side and players, except for the rover, were not allowed to move into the other zones? Maybe it was all those years when ALL peewee aged players were not allowed to body check?  It's possible that the league didn't just pull this decision out of a hat.  We're talking about lower skill levels of one age group of kids. For quite a while no peewees in Ontario had body checking until they shifted the age bracket (which I think they've since shifted back???).  Anybody watch a peewee game in the last 5 years? I did, the body checking was minimal. The charging, interference and boarding was substantial.  The big Quebec City PeeWee Tournament, as well as numerous others are no body checking. Rest assured the world will continue to spin and Canada will produce elite level hockey talent in spite of ourselves.     "

None of these kids will ever play hockey for anything other than fun.  Many kids quit at this age because of the contact.  Also they are still allowing contact just no hitting  Played house league (Kiwanis) from the age of 4 to 18.  Contact started in Peewee and finished in Midget.  There were non-contact leagues that were available for the kids that didn't want to play contact.  It's never a bad thing to teach kids when they're young how to properly give and take a hit.  It also (in my opinion) really helps their on ice awareness and just gives them better hockey smarts.

No goons just kids that you had to play heads up hockey against.  Our first game the kids had a hard time turning off the physical part and there was a few kids that got rubbed out on the boards pretty good.  Basically every kid on the Kanata team skated with there heads down. It was brutal to watch. All this talk you hear about leave the hitting out and the other skills will become more developed... well I never saw any evidence of that at this tournament. Frankly I saw the exact opposite. Taking contact out of a contact sport produces a weaker less skilled player. And if you are a true hockey fan it is painful to watch. I told the coach... as did other parents...that if we entered anymore non contact tournaments we would not be attending. He said there was no chance that would ever happen again and it didn't. He hated it as well.  I say don't mess with the game. Period. If your truly concerned about the well being of your kids pick another activity that satisfies your criteria for what is physically acceptable. Don't go watering down a sport others already enjoy as it is.

Coaches are not going to do it if that player doesn't know how to receive a hit never mind deliver one. So development stops.

That said, I think it's stupid for them to kill checking for any teams that require tryouts.  We fall into the ""rural"" bracket and even though we have some kids that could easily play AA/AAA hockey in larger centers, we don't have the population to put together a full team of this caliber.

Like lready mentioned there is other levels of hockey for kids to play without contact."

It taught me to keep my head up, to look for people to pass too more quickly and to be more aware. It's a part of the game. Yes, there will always be kids who are out to ""head-hunt"" but so be it. They will be the same kids doing it in a non-contact enviroment. You can't avoid the meat-heads out there. Same thing goes in non-contact adult leagues. I remember I played a few games in Oakville many many years ago against Mcsorleys brother. OMG....this guy was a complete maniac. I've since stopped watching NHL hockey because of the way they play. I'm a big fan of the hard nose, grinding style of play....not the ""cycling in the corner"" or ""dump and chase"" game they play now. God forbid you touch another player when they skate past you these days.........ugh..."
902386,landry,2015-03-08 22:53:00,1005,"I agree that tourneys will be awkward to organize... Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course. That was just mine. My kid plays Lacrosse and loves to hit. He is 12. He would rather have contact. I can see that he will not be an elite player so I would rather he didn't. I put him into lacrosse to toughen him up and it is rough. Lol. He loves it. However, hockey is far more potentially dangerous when it comes to head and spinal injuries. The game is just plain faster Than it was when We played. There is far less room on the ice. On a side note, I would not like to see higher levels or pro hockey changed in any significant way other than I would like to see a bigger ice surface so that the super skilled players can work their magic a bit more. When I watch the Classic games, I can't believe how much more room and how much slower it was."
902387,woodenboater,2015-03-08 23:05:00,2277,"yup, NHL shoulda decreed that ALL new arenas be Olympic size, but alas...GB didn't do that..."
902388,FloatnFly,2015-03-08 23:05:00,1640,"It all boils down to awareness, kids these days are not aware of their surroundings. look at the kids walking to school, most of them have their eyes focused on a cell phone or ipod, more self awareness means a safer product on the ice,  yes, you can have a successful product without checking ie Womens hockey, but checking belongs in the game"
902389,msp,2015-03-08 23:26:00,1336,I'm on the fence about this topic. What about this theory......... Teach them at a young age to hit properly and to take a hit properly ( similar to lacrosse ) By the time they are 10-13 years old they already know how to avoid the contact by keeping their head up and moving the puck. Introducing contact at an age like 13 and 14 when they are full of piss and vinegar might not be the right time.

I think there are too many more moving parts to learning hockey compared to most other team sports. Football and lacrosse are 2 collision sports but the skill of skating, and the large increase in speed, are games changers."
902395,bigugli,2015-03-09 00:28:00,6138,"This idea that non-contact will stop the fighting is ludicrous. Bullies will be bullies. Short of expelling players from a league the fights won't stop. Half of the brawling mentality is learnt at home. Not on the ice I believe a league in BC was contemplating imposing sanctions upon a group of parents after a brawl in the stands. Heck, my kid brother was banned from a provincial softball tournament for being a complete jerk at his son's game. Those who are fans of the Philly goon squad will continue to push their kids into that style of hockey. Look at the intermission commentary. We scorecard teams and players on the number of hits delivered.  That never used to be a meaningful stat. And that style of hockey will remain popular as long as coaches in big league hockey keep the goon squad in their game plan"

Football and lacrosse are 2 collision sports but the skill of skating, and the large increase in speed, are games changers.  While lacrosse is a pretty rough sport, players can only go as fast as their feet allow. skates allow players to hit others like runaway freight trains. big difference and less control. regardless, the majority of parents chose this route and I wouldn't be surpassed to see other leagues follow suit. I would bet that if GTHL teams don't travel as much because of the checking issue, then other leagues will have to scramble to find other teams to fill the void. It's only a matter of time imo.  there will always be checking in the game, that's a given. but let young kids develop their stick and skating skills so they can then learn how to throw elbows like Gordie Howe"

Look, we all love a rough game but if the best hockey is played without fighting, then maybe the brain trusts in NY would get a clue..."
902399,bigugli,2015-03-09 00:43:00,6138, One bigger reason for people turning away from the NHL is the cult of entitlement that the NHLPA has created for their membership. A bunch of overpaid prima donnas.
902401,Paudash,2015-03-09 00:59:00,273,what most of you do not realize is the GTHL A hockey is the house league of 20 years ago.  None of these kids will ever play hockey for anything other than fun.  Many kids quit at this age because of the contact.  Also they are still allowing contact just no hitting
902404,kickingfrog,2015-03-09 01:21:00,8333,"Rogers just had a coach on national television say: ""You don't have the luxury of working on skills during a hockey practice.""  Just let that sink in.   Skill development is a luxury.... in practice.  I don't want to rip on the coach (or coaches). They're volunteers and so many do so much good but they and the parents are too wrapped up in winning instead of developing ability."
902412,bigugli,2015-03-09 01:52:00,6138,"  It's still about the prima donna mentality. Nobody likes a loser, and every one wants to back a winner. A good coach would take the view that ""you can learn a hell of a lot from losing, and a lot less from winning""."
