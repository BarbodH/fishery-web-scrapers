903285,kickingfrog,2015-03-13 15:33:00,8333,My mom found a box of my stuff in the basement and brought it over to the house.  Remember when the regs were this size? Remember when you could get a copy of the regs?  
903290,Joeytier,2015-03-13 15:58:00,3990,My local gas station has had a huge pile of 2015 regs for months!
903317,Acountdeleted,2015-03-13 17:20:00,2562,Awwww. I thought this was going to list some of the 'good ole' regs. Only keep one sturgeon per day.
903336,AKRISONER,2015-03-13 18:16:00,5558,hahaha musky 4 per day possession limit of 8 no slot.
903338,gaspumper,2015-03-13 18:28:00,393,I still get a copy of the regs every year.
903339,Spiel,2015-03-13 18:31:00,9065,Like this.... 
903372,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-13 20:02:00,8243,Ah the good ole days. 6 Walleye on Nipissing. I don't think a licence was needed then was it?

Remember when you could get a copy of the regs?   You might be too young to remember when only non-residents need a fishing license and the fishing was much better.  If you only remember one thing in life, it's the more money you give to the government the less you get in return."

903545,John Bacon,2015-03-14 14:34:00,3277,"Ah the good ole days. 6 Walleye on Nipissing. I don't think a licence was needed then was it?  Yes, licenses were required back then.  They were introduced around the mid to late eighties."
903547,kickingfrog,2015-03-14 14:55:00,8333," Yes, licenses were required back then.  They were introduced around the mid to late eighties.   Ya, I remember that when they first started I didn't need one for a couple of years. So '86 or '87 maybe?  Inside that reg book it mentions the ""new"" 3 year outdoors card being introduced. It also mentions conservation licences and it appears that that was the first year for them as well.  Prices (including 7% federal GST); Outdoors card valid for 3 years  $6.00 Resident licence                         $15.00 (About $22.50 in 2014 dollars) Resident Conservation                $7.50  No mention of the 3 year licence options that we have had for the last number of years."
903608,Mike Pike,2015-03-14 20:36:00,1332,"Ha Ha Ha...I remember that!  The regs were so simple in that skinny. flimsy little book.  Man, now I'm gonna go to the video store to rent a VCR player and watch Jaws!  lol"
