902427,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-09 03:14:00,10439,Spent the weekend playing around @ my lease. Hauled a bunch of lumber up the hill that I already had on site. I took a little video from my sled of the trip from truck to lease and back with the drive up the trail I cut in last year. Had to bring in water to hose down the trail in spots to get it to firm up enough so I won't spin the track when hauling a load. Did the top end yesterday with 15 gallons of water spread using a watering can and it worked great. Didn't spin out there today even with a full load of 6x6's.  The video   I managed to get my beams up the hill solo but I must say a 16' 8x8 pressure treated beam is not light at all.    It's a lot harder to back up a loaded komatik than it is to back up a trailer.    Digging out the 6x6's   
902435,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-09 04:11:00,8243,"So that's what you call a leisurely weekend in the Artic? Ever thought of going bowling? I don't get it but I know you do as well as many, many members here, that's all who counts and I'm happy for you. The sled turned out really well."
902436,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-09 04:26:00,10439,"This cabin building thing is putting a damper on the relaxing part of living. But where there's a building in place I will be sitting back on the deck looking out @ the lake and be smiling ear to ear, Planning to spend 5 or 6 weeks out there this summer working on the shell of the building."
902441,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-09 05:26:00,8243,"Nice to look forward to, we live right on the lake and it's going to be tough to move away some day. After last winter and getting buried here with constant lake effect squalls I just about had enough. Even had an agent out to do an appraisal. Before I knew it is was April and had the BBQ fired and walking down to the beach catching 25 pound plus Carp. I forgot all about listing it until the first water line froze last month due to my stupidity. You will love it Dave. I see you say ""lease"" if I'm not being too nosey how does that work? There is a community just east of us where they are on yearly leases. They have to be away from the cottages for any 6 months a year. All the services are up to the residence to arrange and pay for. The hydro infrastructure and telephone service is provided by the owner as well as road maintenance in summer. I calculated the lease cost per year would be the property tax rate if the cottage owner would pay if they owned the land."
902447,solopaddler,2015-03-09 09:19:00,8605,Pretty cool Dave.

I calculated the lease cost per year would be the property tax rate if the cottage owner would pay if they owned the land.   Currently the leases are very cheap @ $150/year. They were done through the Feds until last fall when the territorial govt. took over land administration. It is my guess that at some point we will be able to buy out our leases and have deeded land. They did that with a section of leased land last year. We will see what if anything happens with taxes when and if that happens. These are off grid properties so water, sewer, power are all the lease owners responsibility."

902507,manitoubass2,2015-03-09 16:57:00,11391,"With the things ive seen you build and showcase on this site, me thinks this property is going to turn out stellar?.  My cabin build starts next winter and I dont care if it takes ten years to finish, sittin on the finished product will sure be amazing."
902508,kickingfrog,2015-03-09 17:04:00,8333,How much day light are you working with at this point?
902512,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-09 17:25:00,10439,We're up to 11 already and gaining 6 minutes a day at this point.
902613,Rod Caster,2015-03-10 00:12:00,5784,"That 'komatik' is something sweet. I'd love to build/have one, but my 250cc tundra is not a good match.  How much snow are you working in? It looks to be fairly well packed. Here, we have 3-4' of loose powder."
902629,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-10 01:48:00,10439,We are low on snow compared to most years. I would guess it's knee deep out on the lake. There are spots on the lease that are waist deep and a few spots where it's less than a foot.  I've been running the trail for a few weeks making sure it's nicely packed from the ice road to the property as I will be hauling a ton of lumber out there shortly. I just dropped $11K on lumber @ lunch today. It is supposed to be delivered to my house tomorrow. Then I have to load it on my buddies trailer and we'll cart it out to the lease.
902633,Moosebunk,2015-03-10 02:09:00,3970,That's time not wasted at all.  Work & play together.

902741,kickingfrog,2015-03-10 21:37:00,8333,On the radio I thought I heard it was $18k.
902806,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-11 01:40:00,10439,UH OH!!! What did I get myself into? Got my big wood delivery today. Now I just need to get it up the lake to the property. It's possible I may have bitten off more than I can chew!!!! I think it will take more than one trip.
