It made the slush from the thaw today a breeze to pull through on simcoe, with no bogging at all. I still have a few mods that I want to do to fit my needs, also a paint job is in order, but I'm glad I finally finished it instead of having an old set of ski's rusting in my backyard "
903019,davey buoy,2015-03-12 06:47:00,5505,Nicely done!!!
