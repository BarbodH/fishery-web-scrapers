903115,spincast,2015-03-12 21:52:00,3279,"just what Hamilton needs, more Bull"
903116,leaf4,2015-03-12 21:53:00,2466,"Pretty excited, can't ever support the AHL affiliate of the stinky habs, so to have an OHL team I'm sure I'll attend a couple games a year"
903119,F7Firecat,2015-03-12 21:58:00,347,ya maybe lucas can drive own the qew and support his laffs with the likes of  kadri kessel lupul phaneef and the other overpaid members of that so called hockey team
903127,leaf4,2015-03-12 22:21:00,2466,Lol I would if I could afford to go to more of those games!
903129,grizzlybri,2015-03-12 22:25:00,565,Didn't Bellville juts get a new arena a last year?  here is a article about the relocation  http://www.tsn.ca/ohl-moves-belleville-bulls-to-hamilton-1.229293
903132,kickingfrog,2015-03-12 22:30:00,8333,"Didn't Bellville juts get a new arena a last year?   The Bulls have played in the same olympic sized ice right from when they started back in the late 70's, Not sure if there is a new rink in the works but I'm guessing no, if they're being sold and moved.  I'm sure it's good news for hockey fans in the Hammer but sucks for those in Belleville."

903158,Gerritt,2015-03-13 00:13:00,6129,The problem here in belleville was the arena itself. It was not large enough to ever host a memorial cup..and is aging. The writing was on the wall for some time so it appears.  http://www.intelligencer.ca/2015/03/12/editorial-bulls-are-gone---and-it-stinks  http://www.intelligencer.ca/2015/03/12/devastating-loss-for-city-of-belleville  http://www.intelligencer.ca/2015/03/12/bulls-sale-official-statements  G
903178,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-13 02:14:00,956,Very happy about this move.  Now we can see some guys who haven't been drafted in the NHL yet.
903208,Yellow Fever,2015-03-13 11:14:00,139,I am a Kingston guy and I feel for the loyal fans and the community of Belleville....I had no idea this was in the works.
903227,dave524,2015-03-13 12:33:00,4508,"I'm confused , isn't there already a team called the Hamilton Bulldogs ??"
903229,Gerritt,2015-03-13 12:36:00,6129,"Dave, not sure if their name is changing in the move...  But here they are the Belleville Bulls.  G"
903234,dave524,2015-03-13 12:46:00,4508,"Thanks to google have it sorted out........quote:  ""On March 12, 2015, Michael Andlauer announced that he had acquired the Belleville Bulls, and that they would move to Hamilton's FirstOntario Centre for the 2015-16 season and become the Hamilton Bulldogs. The current Hamilton Bulldogs, an American Hockey League franchise, was concurrently sold to the Montreal Canadiens and will move to St. John's, Newfoundland for the 2015-16 season as the St. John's IceCaps(the current, True North Sports and Entertainment-owned IceCaps, which are affiliated with the Winnipeg Jets, will move back to Winnipeg on an interim basis).[1]""  all very confusing"
903245,Gerritt,2015-03-13 13:01:00,6129,It is..... And given hamiltons history of supporting minor hockey....   The Bulls are doomed im afraid..  No wonder Hamilton  will never see an NHL team.  This is bad.... And dirty how it happened.  G
903260,Gerritt,2015-03-13 13:37:00,6129,Uhoh..... The mayor is all butthurt....  http://www.intelligencer.ca/2015/03/12/mayor-blindsided-by-sale  Too little and way to late....  G
903267,kickingfrog,2015-03-13 14:06:00,8333,And when the habs finish the rink in Laval they'll move the farm team there in 2 years leaving St. John's looking for another team.
