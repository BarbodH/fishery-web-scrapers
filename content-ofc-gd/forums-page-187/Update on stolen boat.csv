902883,Mister G,2015-03-11 16:16:00,1429,"Boat was taken from a locked up barn,,they had to shovel snow first to get in and break into the barn,,the barn is out of sight,,so they had time to get the boat,,barn is only used for storage only,,there is nothing to the story,like i said earlier in my post...THE OWNER DID NOT WANT THE BOAT TAKEN,,it is just one of things that go on alot lately... Boats get stolen out of barns and then returned without the police finding it....that is what is going on a lot lately ? ? ? I was born at night but it wasn't last night ! ! !  In my first post in your first thread, go back and read it........I said this is a inside job because how did someone know there was a boat in there to steal, yet return it a week later."
902974,SuperDave,2015-03-12 00:46:00,204,I agree this does not make any sense. I'm going to hire the Terminator to watch my boat.

The boat belonged to my sisters boyfriends father who is 70 years old , this would be last thing that he would want . PEOPLE CAN BELIEVE WHAT THEY WANT IF THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY .  I came on here to make a post in regards to this boat being stolen for him , hoping someone would see it or hear something , it was found and that is great , thanks to everyone who read this and offered suggestions ,. now i think it is time to end this post or have it locked..."

902206,jrdigs,2015-03-08 03:43:00,11,"Want to thank everyone for their comments and for viewing this post , Today the boat was recovered and returned to its owner , Thanks again everyone,,"
902208,Roy,2015-03-08 03:49:00,13728,Had it been damaged? Glad it was recovered.
902209,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-08 03:54:00,10439,Glad to hear. Is it in the same condition as it was before it was stolen? Are the perpetrators in the hoosegow? Where was it located? Inquiring minds want to know!!!
902210,mattaw,2015-03-08 03:54:00,162,Great to hear. So glad we had a positive outcome. Details would be good  How was it found?
902212,HTHM,2015-03-08 04:04:00,4082,Maybe this is related?: http://www.thespec.com/news-story/5465598-hamilton-cop-s-jet-ski-suspicions-prove-correct/
902213,jrdigs,2015-03-08 04:04:00,11,"Boat was located in hamilton and was in the same condition it was when taken , someone got word of a stolen boat for sale and was visited , everything has been taken care of ."
902214,woodenboater,2015-03-08 04:15:00,2277,"Wow, that's amazing news and HTHM's link is probably spot on. Hope the thief is given some serious consideration, and I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't their first heist.  I also hope in the future, we can think a bit before jumping to conclusions about stolen equipment."
902216,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 04:28:00,8243,"Hamilton, well that explains much. Years of inhaling carbon and sulphur dioxide does a bit of brain damage. I have to get into my space module and get back to the Mothership now.  So much for everyone including me guessing it ended up on Six Nations."
902227,4x4bassin,2015-03-08 05:54:00,1025,That's great news
902277,FrankTheRabbit,2015-03-08 14:54:00,479,"Great instincts from the officer, regarding the story.  Glad to hear you got your boat back!"
902287,Fisherman,2015-03-08 15:27:00,7201,"Ok, that's great, where do we buy tickets to get in line to apply a beating to the thief.  Someone can make a big ""T"" branding iron, I'll bring the heater."
902298,grizzlybri,2015-03-08 16:46:00,565,"is the story related because in it, the article states it was reported stolen in 2012?  Regardless glad to hear it was recovered"
902315,davey buoy,2015-03-08 17:53:00,5505,Hahaha. That was funny. I'd say lol.
902333,jrdigs,2015-03-08 19:05:00,11,"is the story related because in it, the article states it was reported stolen in 2012?  Regardless glad to hear it was recovered No it was not the story in the spectator,,A CO WORKER WAS APPROACHED ASKING IF HE WANTED TO BUY A STOLEN BOAT AND HE ASKED WHAT KIND IT WAS , THE GUY SAID IT WAS A BOAT WHICH HE HAD STOLEN THE OTHER NIGHT,, IT WAS THE BOAT WHICH WAS MISSING,,THE OTHER GUY WENT ON TO SAY THAT IS MY FRIENDS BOAT AND IT WOULD BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO DELIVER IT TO THIS LOCATION IF HE DID NOT WANT THE POLICE CALLED,,LONG STORY SHORT THE OWNER IS HAPPY TO HAVE IT BACK AGAIN,,THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE"
902335,Pikeslayer,2015-03-08 19:11:00,1443,Happy to hear your buddy got his boat back despite the ominous accusations.  Hope your buddy has a plan in place if he discovers any issues/damages when starting the boat in the spring.
902340,woodenboater,2015-03-08 19:55:00,2277,"so the guy got off by returning the boat ? that's so wrong imo. dude should be locked up and sent to correctional. he'll do it again guaranteed, he'll just know not to say he stole it...smh"
902444,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-09 06:36:00,8243,"Woodenboater I see you are from Toronto. It is Hamilton we are talking about. It is the way things are done there sometimes. Most not from there, and I don't mean transplanted from somewhere and now lives there, would understand how it works at times. It's just the way things are done. Right or wrong. That Paul Bernardo and his murdering waste of life wife eventually got arrested not through Police work but from a tip from an notorious wiseguy from Hamilton. Without that tip they may still be on the street. What's that got to do with a stolen boat, it just shows most crime is solved without the police solving it in Hamilton."
902492,Basschaser77,2015-03-09 16:12:00,32,Just glad the boat went back to its rightful owner.
902493,BillM,2015-03-09 16:12:00,17367,Good news!
902698,doubleheader,2015-03-10 16:31:00,497,"I'm glad he got his boat back, but I don't care where this took place to let the thief off is wrong. There's right and there is wrong, it really isn't that difficult be it Hamilton Ontario or any other place."
902700,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-10 17:23:00,8243,"The thief may have not been charged by the police but he would not have been let off lightly. He would have had to pay a monetary goof tax as well as gotten a spanking in the old days, and he would have thought really hard the next time he thought about taking something that wasn't his to take. He would notice a finger or 2 missing. That does  a heck of a lot more to deter theft than a 12 month suspended sentence. I don't know about today."
902793,glen,2015-03-11 00:49:00,2641,What do they do with all those extra fingers.
902835,Mister G,2015-03-11 11:05:00,1429,Boat gets stolen from barn. Boat is offered to someone who knows boat owner. Boat gets returned to owner WITHOUT police involved.  I don't know about the rest of you boys and girls but I didn't just fall off the turnip truck last night. Something sounds very fishy with this whole story. We are not being told the truth and or the complete story.
