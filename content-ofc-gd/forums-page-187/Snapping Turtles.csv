901839,dks,2015-03-06 01:02:00,36,I wouldn't eat them since I recall reading somewhere that the contaminant levels in them were very high. Old turtles would have had a long time accumulating toxins.
901842,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-06 01:16:00,8243,"I said ""generally"" since this is a G rated site I will not elaborate."
901848,Beavertail,2015-03-06 01:56:00,331,"This last fall while at work on three separate occasions, I found tiny, baby snapping turtles in the parking lot...shells no bigger than a Toonie. Perfect little replicas of the adults minus the nasty attitudes!"
901850,manitoubass2,2015-03-06 02:09:00,11391,"Man some of the lakes we swim in have huge snapping turtles. Always kinda been a fear of mine to lose a toe or worse lol.  As a child i found a shell up on the beach when we were camping. I though wow that would be awesome to bring home!  Turned out hornets thought it would be awesome to make INTO a home!  Not cool hornets, not cool"
901883,northernpike56,2015-03-06 04:19:00,717,"Here's what beavertail means by the baby snappers, they are incredible:   I seem to find a lot of them crossing the road in the early summer (no dont worry I'm not like the duck lady, I pull off to the shoulder with hazard lights on lol)  Also caught a water snake and a star nosed mole on some country roads last summer, those are pretty much my weirdest catches. "
901890,Musky or Specks,2015-03-06 05:24:00,2710,"I regularly stop on back roads and pick the buggers up so they don't end up as road kill because turtles are in trouble as a species,so no I wouldn't eat one. Please le the turtles go and stick to fast maturing and growing fish."
901905,singingdog,2015-03-06 11:02:00,1047,"Yes, they are a species at risk; does seem odd that it's still legal to harvest them. Picking large ones up by the tail can damage their spine. I move dozens of them every year, and have found the best way is to grab the top shell, above the hind legs, and drag them backwards. Lots of folks up here carry a shovel in the spring to scoop them off the road."
901987,aplumma,2015-03-06 18:22:00,6896,Snapping turtles are excellent to eat. They can be carried by the tail with no issues. You do have to remember to hold them out from your side because they can get you in the leg.  Art
902079,northernpike56,2015-03-07 05:41:00,717,"Here's an interesting hold:   Another one:   Apparently the first guy is a biologist so I'll probably go with his style over the kid's, but they both seem to be better than holding the tail."
903674,35Wailin,2015-03-15 01:01:00,59,"When I catch them on land, I HOLD the tail to keep them relatively still and slip my other hand under the shell from behind.  The tail is still held, but only to help balance it on my hand.  There is no strain to the legs or tail.  They cannot easily claw you with their back legs.  Hanging them vertically by the tail cannot be good for them.  Neither is grabbing a bass by the lip and holding it horizontally or grabbing a pike by the eyes.  Normally, though, I leave the turtles alone.  I have a soft spot for all turtles.  I'm really kinda fascinated by the snappers, because they seem to be more like living dinosaurs than other turtle species.  I haven't seen many snappers lately and more Midland Painted ones, but then again, the opposite is true some years.  Just depends where I am, I guess."
901479,northernpike56,2015-03-04 04:49:00,717,"Is it true that you can keep a snapping turtle with just a sport fishing license (as long as you have caught it in season and by a legal method, and are planning to report the harvest to the MNR)? I was looking through the hunting regs and it seemed to say that it was legal, but I've always thought you'd need a small game license to keep one. Thoughts??"
901482,Woodsman,2015-03-04 05:37:00,1286,"Yes it's true.  GAME AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES Holders of valid recreational fishing licences may catch and retain bullfrogs and snapping turtles during open seasons.

901487,Freshtrax,2015-03-04 06:43:00,2215,Yep but you must catch it with your bare hands.
901490,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 06:57:00,8243,"Hahaaaaaa. That's a keeper. Seriously, barehands."
901492,Freshtrax,2015-03-04 07:31:00,2215,"""Under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act the Snapping Turtle can be taken with a valid sport or fishing license by box or funnel trap or by bare hands.""  Info may me outdated.   May want to check with a co.   Anyone eat one ?  I'd give it a try on a small one."
901537,mike rousseau,2015-03-04 16:02:00,4661,I used to catch em bare handed all the time...  They come into the boathouse to eat the fish guts... They show up like 15-20 minutes after you put some in the water... I used to use a net when I was a kid but it made to much of a mess or they wouldn't fit... Then I would just grab em with my hands... Always let em go after... It was neat for any kids around or city folk... They looked at my like I was the crocodile hunter or something... They didn't seam to mind too much... They'd be back eating again within the hour....  Now we just watch them quietly... We even recognize a few of the bigger ones that show up regularly...
901561,Beavertail,2015-03-04 18:22:00,331,"Yeah, I use to catch them when I was growing up too. At one time I entertained the idea of eating one, but never got around to it...most of the specimens I caught were stinky, foul, prehistoric creatures - not too appetizing. I do recall cooking instructions(boiling) that required many, many  water changes. Don't think the wife would be all too happy about it!"
901566,dave524,2015-03-04 19:10:00,4508,"I ate snapping turtle soup a few times back when I lived in Port Rowan in the early 70's. Never was in on the cleaning or the prep, I do remember veggies ( celery and carrots ) and pot barley in there, no noodles.  But there are probably as many recipes as there are cooks but it was tasty. So was marsh rabbit stew, but you need to know a muskrat trapper for that one, they are only legal under a trapping license. I recall them saying there is seven different kinds of meat on a turtle."
901574,Beavertail,2015-03-04 19:33:00,331,"Curious about this Marsh Rabbit...never heard of it before. Is this in Ontario? As far as I'm aware, we only have Cottontails, Snowshoe Hares and European Hares..."
901581,Thrilla,2015-03-04 19:40:00,164,Went to a Muskrat dinner a month ago and I couldn't believe how good it was
901583,AKRISONER,2015-03-04 19:47:00,5558,people will friggin eat anything...ill stick with steak and the occaisonal venison and elk steak.

901670,manitoubass2,2015-03-05 01:46:00,11391,Ive had snapping turtle as well.  Had good flavor but boy it coulda been prepped/cooked better. Toughest meat ever lol  Here in NWO they get hyyyuge!!! Ive seen some that musta been 50-60lbs

901712,AKRISONER,2015-03-05 13:44:00,5558,"you wouldnt be grabbing the snappers around my cottage by the tail, some are probably close to 40 lbs, their shells are easily 3x3"
901718,Beavertail,2015-03-05 14:16:00,331,"I don't know how good it is for the turtle, grabbing them by the tail...but it's good for the handler! I always liked to keep my hands as far away from that mouth as possible. They have really long, flexible necks and can reach back pretty far lightning quick. We use to get them to snap down on a branch and it was impressive, they would make short work of a finger."
901719,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 14:19:00,8243,I could never eat anything that moved slower than I do. It looks about as appetizing as the guys foot in the pic above. But to each his own. I generally won't eat anything I wouldn't kiss on the lips. Lobster and Calamari isn't very appetizing either so there are exceptions to my rules.
901799,Big Cliff,2015-03-05 21:52:00,6899,"Man this is an interesting thread! First of all (and this is from experience):  Snapping turtles are EXCELLENT eating! As Dave524 stated, there are 7 different kinds of meat in one. My son has cooked them up on more than one occasion and it is excellent!  While they do have very powerful jaws, it is clamping strength, not cutting strength! For those of you that have had one chomp down on a stick, have you ever seen one bite through it? Not likely, they will chomp down on it and hold on but they don't cut through it. Mind you, it would HURT your finger!  I have handled them on MANY occasions, I just pick them up by the shell, one hand on each side between the front and back legs, I have never been bitten by one (lots have tried but they just can't get their head that far around), the legs are a different story, they will try to kick your hand off and the claws can be a little sharp but nothing serious.  If you haven't tried it don't knock it, a lot of people haven't tried frogs legs, muscrat, beaver, racoon....

901823,wallacio,2015-03-05 23:53:00,475,"I find it ridiculous that the MNRF still allows harvest of Snapping Turtles when they are on the Species at Risk in Ontario List.  Something to consider even though harvest is legal:  ""The threats of habitat loss and degradation do not negatively affect habitat generalists, like the snapping turtle, as severely as they affect some other species at risk. The life history of the snapping turtle, however, like that of most of Ontario’s turtle species, is characterized by a late age of maturity and a slow reproduction rate, and adults normally live a very long time in the wild – up to 70 years for many individuals. As a result, the loss of even a few adult turtles from a population every year is enough to cause that population to decline, and this makes snapping turtle populations very vulnerable to threats such as road mortality, hunting and poaching. Even though the removal of adults is a serious threat to this species, and despite the snapping turtle being a species at risk in Ontario, hunting this species is still legal in the province (the legal limit is two snapping turtles per day per person). The Ontario Multi-Species Turtles at Risk Recovery Team has strongly urged the Ontario government to remove the snapping turtle from the list of game species in Ontario but so far has been ignored.""

901835,d_paluch,2015-03-06 00:50:00,343,would NEVER even think about eating them. All the ones I have caught smell absolutely disgusting. Not to mention they are probably ancient and I have too much respect for them lol    Bronte Creek 4-5 years ago
