Hey Brian (not guy, not dude,not bud, not sir) this is how you catch lakers on lake Joe. Live bait.  I LMAO at this text.  Once work was done for the day,I head out to fish a couple of hours. As Im sitting there ,I see a couple of guys walking out. One guy looks like someone from the board. I give a shout out. They keep walking. I walk over and sure enough,it,s who I thought it was. Talking away with him and enjoying our talk,I tell him our friend from the board is stopping by next week to pick up my smitty.  Turns out the guy, that is picking it up, is the guy with him.  He laughs as I had never met this guy before.  These two guys were, Christopher K and Jeremy.  What a couple of  weisenheimer guys.  Good seeing ya byes, and nice to have met you Jer."
