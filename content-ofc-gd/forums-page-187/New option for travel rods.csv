I don't know squat about it other then what I read from Fenwick but the concept makes sense to me on paper as I've been known to pack a few too many rods on trips.  Fenwick Methods are travel rods that come with different sections that allow you to change the action/power of the rod. I'm not in the market for one but that doesn't mean I won't be in the future.  http://www.fenwickfishing.com/FenwickÂ®-Methods/1315395,default,pd.html#start=2  Anyway, just passing it along."
903587,aplumma,2015-03-14 18:30:00,6896,I recently picked up two fenwicks because of a rod that Spiel built me on an old blank. They are 9 and 10ft long and have  great action for 3-20lb catfish. I was pleased with the quality and the materials they used and would buy more if I need some more kids and guest rods. My Spiel collection I still have a problem sharing. lol   Art

(That's what the catalog says, although I would think it would be the other way  )  Giving you 4 ""different"" rods.  They have casting and spinning outfits that come in a travel case.  Cabelas.ca has them for $119.99 and $129.99.  I haven't held one yet but I could also see these being an option for someone who isn't interested in having multiple rods for multiple situations.  Anyway, I'll wait for someone to field test 'em first."
