902591,lew,2015-03-09 21:56:00,12766,Thanks for reminding me we've still got 3 1/2 looooong months to go before the season opens Mike LOL
902592,Handlebarz,2015-03-09 22:15:00,3790,Lol I hear ya Lew I have enjoyed passing the winter with shows and will be doing more next year it's great to get out and talk about musky during the long winter months. Our chapter is planning on doing nights like this each month to help people getting started into musky fishing.  I'm also heading to cave run Kentucky this April to break up the winter.
902595,lew,2015-03-09 22:24:00,12766,"Have a good trip to Kentucky Mike, never done it myself but I hear the spring musky fishing can be alot of fun down there."
902602,Handlebarz,2015-03-09 23:08:00,3790,Thanks Lew I went last year with a buddy it is a great place and awesome people down there.  Last year we got there it was 83 in the evening sunny dead calm the morning came it dropped to 63 plus started to pour rain just as we met our guide it stopped only for 10-20 min then started up again for the rest of the day. We had one follow what a long cold day.  Day two we met our other guide the temps came up a few degrees by 9 am it was closing in on 100 by noon we had called mercy and were driving home totally roasted like lobsters. The guide we had this day was awesome he was talking to 9 other guides and no one saw a fish but Scott worked us hard trying many different styles all over the place it was not for trying just bad weather luck.  Both guides were happy that we were both musky nuts so we did not cry about no fish.  I'm looking forward to this year at musky mountain lodge and getting down to see my friends Tony Grany Scott Charlie Vicki mike jones and others. If anyone was looking to get away have a look at his place only $695 gives you three nights stay plus two full days with his guides.

902640,solopaddler,2015-03-10 03:31:00,8605,I would love to cast for musky!
902743,Handlebarz,2015-03-10 21:46:00,3790,I hear ya mike it would be nice to get out.  Phil you and Pj should make the trip down south it's a great place if you guys decide to tow your boat down there I can give you pointers on what they had us doing.  Guess I kinda hijacked my own thread but hey it's musky fishing.
902810,Rizzo,2015-03-11 02:03:00,4754,"...that story cured my desire to go south for some musky fishing. Glad to hear I am not alone sometimes driving a long way and then not doing too well! We always have fun anyways, but the odd fish certainly helps"
903206,Handlebarz,2015-03-13 09:41:00,3790,Oh yeah it's Friday 13th many in SW Ontario are heading to Port Dover for a bike ride I will be having a great time talking about musky.  If your down in the SW corner come out tonight.  Rizzo you are correct there good times can make a trip awesome hell we sat for 50+ min watching a Tortoise come out of the shell what a laugh it was.
