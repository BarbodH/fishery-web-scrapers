I hear ya brother...........my bride is the same, she ALWAYS encourages me to get what I want/looking at while I have a hard time justifying buy it......and that include my new boat I just ordered last week."

When I got the, you need a truck, from my mrs,s,I was like,ok.  I got one.  I could have a boat if I wanted as well,but no parking for it at the condo. Life style choice we made."
903438,irishfield,2015-03-13 23:18:00,26272,"I guess you missed the point Bettie was trying to make when she said ""YOU NEED A TRUCK?!"""
903478,SirCranksalot,2015-03-14 01:39:00,3291,"My friend was complaining about all the money his wife ""wasted"" on quilting. So I asked him how it compared to the money he ""invested"" in lures! He said 'good point' and ended that particular discussion."

903573,Regan Thompson,2015-03-14 17:02:00,80,"I can't sympathize with you enough!  Us men complain when our wives spend $100 to get their hair done but I'm sure our investment in Musky gear must seem equally insane to them.  I'm usually ok as long as I stay away from the tackle stores, but just recently the owner of Northshore Musky baits started attending our Muskies Canada meetings where he sells baits!  Needles to say I had a moment of weakness at our last meeting."
903576,lew,2015-03-14 17:20:00,12766,Hope you got something good for Cross Lake Regan LOL
903579,icedude,2015-03-14 17:39:00,459, Perfect Sir:   Worked for me as well--especially when the Red-Head bought the quilting loom last Christmas  Never heard a Dang word since -seriously Not- No- Nada-Squat   The logistics are Amazing as well SCL  In Jackson's Point-where i visit often The Quilting Shoppe is situated right next door to the Bait and Tackle supplier    Always cool when a plan comes together  Cheers All  Paul.
903580,Old Man,2015-03-14 17:45:00,822,"As many of us have lots of gear, rods reels and tackle etc, I have always done the usual and pile all the 30 plus rods in a corner, and my wife doesnt know whether i have 30, 40 or sold some and have 20 etc, and she really doesnt care as i buy and sell often, but in a hurry one day to make an MCI meeting i mistakingly left the labels and tags on a brand new Musky Innovations Bull Dog Rod, when i got home after this particular meeting my wife asked me if i won anything off the monthly raffle, which i replied no not this time, she says with a bit of womanly sarcasm thats OK i see you bought a new rod anyway, the blue blank and labels were a dead give a way, plus the wraps on the cork.  Im sure many others have a similar story  Fortunately, I'm not faced with this problem. My wife is just as likely to treat herself to a new rod and reel or tackle as I am ."
903610,2 tone z71,2015-03-14 20:49:00,1311,She don't complain to much..she loves fishing as well..got her a avid pearl combo last weekend I'm in the good books for a bit
903625,esoxansteel,2015-03-14 22:09:00,1307,"My wife wasnt complaining at all, and some might have actually missed the humour i was trying to point out, if she complained about the tackle i buy or the fishing i do, we wouldnt have spent 24 years together, she just noticed the new tags, and plastic wrap on the cork, and decided to make a make a comment with some humorous sarcasm"

903123,Handlebarz,2015-03-12 22:07:00,3790,Could have been a bad rod to have her find like the new StCroix elite series.  I'm lucky I don't think I have to hide my stuff from the wife she knows what a difference it can make for our fishing fun. And she was there when I bought my three StCroix LT's and her 1 no complaints I'm lucky that way.
903124,misfish,2015-03-12 22:13:00,29133,"I have three corners mine at layed up against, plus two closets. If I say I need another,she just walks me to each one and asks whats wrong with this one, or this one or this one. LOL"

903145,Whopper,2015-03-12 23:25:00,2174, I don't ask about the shoes and handbags and she doesn't ask me about my gear  I don't spend much money except on fishing gear and fishing trips
903147,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-12 23:37:00,8243,"She has her stuff and I have mine. Except I can be seen with the same rod and reel or Driver more than once or twice. Plus they never go out of style, they become classics."
903151,Rizzo,2015-03-12 23:47:00,4754,"opposite at my house. I don't buy too much, the wife is constantly buying shoes, jewellery, clothes etc...and trust me, I regularly point it out. The difference is, when I do get something, odds are its gonna be BIG"

903163,bigugli,2015-03-13 00:52:00,6138,No complaints in my household.  Then again I am expected to also have  enough workable rod and reel combos for family fishing outings that happen 2 or 3 times a year.

903201,mike rousseau,2015-03-13 05:47:00,4661,I've been reducing the volume of gear I have and increasing the quality...  So to her it looks like less... Lol  In all honesty... I don't really drink... Don't smoke... Don't do drugs... The only thing I spend money on is fishing... So she's ok with it...
903279,manitoubass2,2015-03-13 15:04:00,11391,"My wife has zero issues with me buying fishing gear.  She hates fishing and hates the outdoors, unless its for foraging.  See the thing is, if im out in the bush, fishing or camping, 90% of the time I have my kids with me. So for her its a well deserved break.  Only time Ive ever got in crap was when I bought gear before I payed bills and came up a lil short. But thats totally understandable.  Even then i dont have much gear. Maybe two grand in tackle, about 14 rods/reels, sonar, and a bunch of ice rods. Its really not that much considering i spent 5-6 years accumulating my gear.  I feel for you guys that have to hide stuff lol. She probably already knows hahaha, women arent stupid"
903378,Sinker,2015-03-13 20:17:00,8692,I just tell her its hers and she's cool with it. My GF would rather I spend money on fishing than food most of the time lol.....  S.
903381,AKRISONER,2015-03-13 20:27:00,5558,"the girl and i argue back and forth but as many mentioned it goes both ways, she has new makeup and facewash and clothes and i have new fishing gear.  I only recently realized that guys always have a hobby, it was my car, and now its fishing, either way you gotta spend a little dough on yourself sometimes. Otherwise why in the hell do you bother working!"
