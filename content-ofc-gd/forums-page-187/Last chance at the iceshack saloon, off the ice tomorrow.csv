This will be the last time as it is coming off tomorrow, the ice road is deteriorating quickly, tomorrow and the next day its forecast to be +14C.  All catch and release but its good to get jack practising using the fish finder and setting the hook.  We got a bunch of small ones and Jack got a beauty 19""er as we were just about to shut up shop.  It was a 'pyjama day' at school, so thats what Jack is wearing out on the ice, PJ ice fishing, love it.       ICE ROAD MELTING REAL FAST NOW                         WEARING PJs FISHING IS COOL                          JACK GOT A NICE ONE RIGHT AT THE END          VIDEO  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAC6dLsZT-0/"
