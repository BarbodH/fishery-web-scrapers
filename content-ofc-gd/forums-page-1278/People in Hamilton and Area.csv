28557,huntervasili,2007-01-30 16:14:00,1604,Thursday might even work with me too...
28574,Gerritt,2007-01-30 17:05:00,6129,ok I am in for Thursday and Saturday...  see you guys soon!  PS I was just at Bill's Bait n' Tackle and the reports he is getting from people fishing there is the bite is on.  Gerritt.
28590,Hooked,2007-01-30 17:41:00,891,I only live some 15 minutes away from there and never ice fished.  Think I'll bring my son up there sometime then. Are the fish safe to eat outta there?
28592,Steve,2007-01-30 17:44:00,2075,"the guide to eating fish will allow you to keep crappie out of there for consumption, but have a look....they aren't the cleanest...i wouldn't be giving them to young children your your pregnant wife. it was only a few years ago that Binbrook was coated with sludge due to all the farm runoff that surrounds Lake Niapenco.  That being said, smaller crappie are supposed to be ok to eat.....  Btw, all other game fish are catch and release there. You might get lucky with a decent pike or walleye."
28595,Hooked,2007-01-30 17:49:00,891, Thanks for the heads up.
28607,Gerritt,2007-01-30 18:10:00,6129,"Steve, you gonna be there Thursday or Saturday? would be nice to put a Face to the name..  Gerritt."
28619,SHAD,2007-01-30 18:50:00,134,"I wouldn't feed the fish in there to my cat or dog, nevermind family member, lol....they are fun to catch though but i put them back down the hole.  A 7lb eye was caught and released on sunday"
28626,Corey,2007-01-30 19:21:00,355,"I'll make a post Wed night to confirm if I can go on Thursday, if I can I will bring my little jiffy, if anyone needs holes drilled just ask me if you see me... HH floater suit, frabil ultralite hut and jiffy model 30 auger.  cd."
28652,huntervasili,2007-01-30 20:20:00,1604,what time would every one be heading in thurs/sat?
29009,Corey,2007-01-31 17:07:00,355,"OK... I think I am coming out... I will be there between 8 and 9... if anyone is bringing kids, I have a portable tent type hut I could bring that we could use as a shelter for kids, or even adults who are getting cold. I don't have any type of tie downs for it though.  Let me know if I should dig it out and bring it.  cd."
29123,tonyb,2007-01-31 20:47:00,1637, That lake must be severly polluted for panfish to be inedible!  I had no idea!  Tony
29157,Darrell,2007-01-31 22:09:00,27,"This should clear up any issue of edibility of the fish from Binbrook, by the way it similar to Simcoe.   "
29185,Gerritt,2007-01-31 23:15:00,6129,I will be there with bells on! LOL.... Look for the homemade hut with the fat guy in it LOL.. I should be there around 8:30-9ish as I gotta hit the bait store. Ohhh I will be by the Dam at the beginnning of the day... as you come into the park you'll see a fork in the road turn to the first... and after parking I should be easy to spot.  Gerritt.   Thanks Daryll !! People think that because it is not up north it is crap... it is a nice little lake that really doesnt see a ton of pressure through the year other then the tournaments that they hold.
27623,Gerritt,2007-01-28 15:56:00,6129,"Binbrook Reservoir Open for Ice Fishing January 26th, 11:17 AM  Just and FYI you can now icefish Binbrook... Pike, Bass and pickeral are Catch and Release.. Crappie are Catch and Keep as they are trying to thin out the crappie numbers.   for more info click below.  http://www.glanbrookconservation.on.ca/binbrook.html   Anyone interested in an outing?   Gerritt"
27629,bassjnkie,2007-01-28 16:07:00,1101, Is there carp in there?
27631,Gerritt,2007-01-28 16:12:00,6129,"I do believe there is although I have never caught one.  I just got off the phone with them (Conservation Authority) and was told on average 5.5"" of good solid black ice. Crappie are being caught and alot of slabs have been taken. he also informed me it is still only 3.50 per day per person. You can fish from 8am - Dusk. portable huts are allowed. however you can rent one, but it is suggested you reserve one as they are limited.  Gerritt."
27636,bassjnkie,2007-01-28 16:21:00,1101, Thax for the info Gerritt.
27639,Gerritt,2007-01-28 16:26:00,6129,"""Approximately 9000 carp were also removed from the upper weir area to assist in establishing vegetation, controlling sedimentation and balancing the fish population towards more sports fish (1997).  Monitoring of the fish populations was also necessary to determine the success and best top sport fish.  To ensure the stocked fish can establish a healthy population, a moratorium has been placed on pike, large and smallmouth bass since 1997, where catch and release is only permitted on these species.""   I would assume there would still be some?  Gerritt."
27666,xrap,2007-01-28 17:21:00,683,Yes there are capr int here I got a bunch in the summer.Not to big tho maybe 5-6 lbs. Would give you an awsome fight on the ice rod if you could hook into one.
27668,Gerritt,2007-01-28 17:24:00,6129,xrap you in?? possibly sometime next weekend?  Gerritt.
27674,xrap,2007-01-28 17:33:00,683,I will probally be there next weekend with my brother in law and my dad. But still not to sure. Is there still a time curfew there that you have to be out at 8 or have they changed that for ice fishing?
27677,Motorhead,2007-01-28 17:45:00,163,"Funny you posted about Binbrook Gerritt... I was supposed to meet a couple of friends there this morning, They of course cancelled and I was too lazy to go myself... I`d be willing to meet up next weekend Haven`t fished Lake Niapenco in a long time.. Doug"

28030,SHAD,2007-01-29 14:27:00,134,"There are no crappies or fish at Binbrook, go to Valens  "
28094,knotaclue,2007-01-29 16:38:00,136,"When were you planning to go to Lake Niapenco ?,my buddy wants to watch football on Sunday so there goes my Simcoe plans."
28104,huntervasili,2007-01-29 17:02:00,1604,"Gerrit... I might just come that weekend too, depending on any plans which may be established... What day were you thinking?"

28168,Fang,2007-01-29 19:13:00,1330,Sounds like a plan. My 8 year old son should be tagging along also. That's unless he gets an invite to a B-day party or something.
28179,Gerritt,2007-01-29 19:31:00,6129,"sounds good Fang, I will be in a Blue homemade hut, and will be sure to have my OFC touqe on.  Gerritt.."

28411,Corey,2007-01-30 04:15:00,355,"I was thinking of bagging off work on thursday to cruise over there... if I go, you will hear my auger... and I pull a frabill ultralite around with me.  cd."
