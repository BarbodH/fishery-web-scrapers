29112,TJQ,2007-01-31 20:27:00,7806,"Spring Fishing Show 2007: Drop us a line, catch the fever   A red and white bobber skitters across a placid lake. A young child watches intently. Suddenly, the float goes under and another lifelong journey begins. For many Canadians, that first angling experience will lead them to pristine lakes, wild rivers, and friendships that transcend age, gender, geography and race.  That’s why we’d like to invite you to Spring Fishing Show 2007 – the largest show of its kind in Canada. Join us from February 15th through 18th at the International Centre in Mississauga as we celebrate the wonderful sport of angling.  Whether you’re new to fishing or an old hand, we’re sure SFS 2007 has something to offer. Brought to you by Ontario OUT OF DOORS magazine (OOD), the Canadian Sportfishing Industry Association, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH), Banrock Station Wines, and the World Fishing Network (WFN), we’ve gathered some of Canada’s best fishing and boating manufacturers and retailers, lodge owners, and celebrity anglers under one roof.  Pro and celebrity anglers, including Bob Izumi, Dave Mercer, Leo Stakos, Shaw Grigsby, Italo Labignan, Rocky Crawford, Big Jim McLaughlin, Shawn Rickard, Paul Powis, and Barry Pringle, will entertain and inform on the WFN main stage. They’ll be joined by OOD’s Fishing Editor Gord Ellis and Field Editors James Smedley, and Dan Kennaley who, along with the OFAH’s Cam Brownson, host of Angler and Hunter television, will demonstrate proven, fish-catching techniques, non-stop during show hours.  Join Fish’n Canada host Angelo Viola, Pete Bowman and Mike Miller Saturday morning from 10 a.m.- noon for a special two-hour live broadcast of their popular Outdoor Journal radio show airing on the Fan 590.  Those who love a shore lunch shouldn’t miss Hooked and Cooked – the Battle of the Fishing Chefs. That’s when OOD Cooking Editor Sue Kane cooks off against fishing legend Bob Izumi in an effort to win your taste buds. There’s food, fun, and great prizes to be had, Saturday at 1 pm.  And what would fishing be without tall tales? Not half as much fun. That’s why on Friday and Saturday nights, OOD Editor-in-Chief Matt Nicholls will host a Tall Tales hour at the Banrock Station Lodge lounge area. While prizes will be awarded to the best fish stories, laughs are sure to be had by all.  Don’t forget to bring the whole family! The SFS Kids’ Zone is specifically designed for the young anglers in your family, featuring fishing for live fish in Fish TV’s Trout Pond and a boatload of other fun fishing activities. Or, if your young ones already know a thing or two about handling rod and reel, they can test their skills at the Bassmaster Casting Kids casting competition. All competitors will win prizes and a chance to advance all the way to the finals south of the border.  Those who want to enter the exciting world of turkey hunting can do so by taking the OFAH turkey hunter’s course held on Saturday February 17th at the show. Pre-registration is mandatory, so call the OFAH at 705-748-6324 or visit www.ofah.org.  As if all that isn’t enough we’ve got leading retailers including Le Baron’s Outdoor Products, J.B.’s Fishing Depot, Fishing World, Grimsby Tackle, Natural Sports, and Tightline. Add to that a host of lodges and manufacturers to address all of your angling needs and introduce you to the latest and greatest in fishing gear, electronics, boats and motors, as well as new and exciting travel destinations. In total, there are 200 plus exhibitors, each happy to talk fishing, provide advice, and help you catch the fever. So come on down. We’ve got what it takes to float your boat. And so much more.
