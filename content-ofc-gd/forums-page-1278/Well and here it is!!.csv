29254,Gerritt,2007-02-01 01:26:00,6129,"moe there are 3 different ""skins"" you can choose from.... Look in the bottom Left hand corner... Dont like any of them?  Gerritt."
29257,motv8tr,2007-02-01 01:28:00,2587,"Tried Gerritt, not available yet...will give it until tomorrow when all the changes should be done...I'm sure it's not an easy job for these guys...but thanks for the suggestion.  Maureen"

29260,Gerritt,2007-02-01 01:29:00,6129,ok Looks like upgrades are still in progress... OFNCClub is now available for use.  Gerritt.
29261,Joey,2007-02-01 01:30:00,9122,"There, I changed it to beige/brown.  I think I like that one better.  Joey"
29262,FinS,2007-02-01 01:30:00,463,wow thats fast material
29263,bigfish1965,2007-02-01 01:31:00,3382,The upgrade seems complete..I am just adding the skin edits now
29265,Squid,2007-02-01 01:32:00,1656,"Check my thread, I get errors.."

29299,FishFinder,2007-02-01 02:08:00,481,any chance of getting the driftwood skin back?
29300,irishfield,2007-02-01 02:09:00,26272,"Rick, will the ""quick edit"" feature be coming back? It was priceless on Dial up."
29303,fishindevil,2007-02-01 02:12:00,6254,looks great guys ....you mods are the best....
29304,Roy,2007-02-01 02:13:00,13728,"As far as I can tell, Quick edit still works well."
29306,Gerritt,2007-02-01 02:15:00,6129,I agree with Roy Quick Edit is functional here as well.  Gerritt.  Yup it works.
29307,irishfield,2007-02-01 02:16:00,26272,I just edited a post and it no longer comes up and gives you the choice between quick edit and full edit. Quick edit would just stay on the same page and let you edit right in the post...it now takes you to a full edit/reply page to do an edit adding a couple page loads to get it done.
29318,huntervasili,2007-02-01 02:27:00,1604,This is the skin i have used anyway... great job mods... the only thing is I cant tell if people are online...
