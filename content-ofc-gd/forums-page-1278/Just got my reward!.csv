28821,camillj,2007-01-31 02:40:00,1988,"Hey so sorry to hear what happened Cliff, even more sorry to hear how and why !  Day one is not the day to make any life altering decisions - but to share the support of all those you have done a good turn to over the years, and having met you even though it was only briefly I am sure those are MANY and more importantly they are the kind of folks whose support has substance and meaning.  Something to think about before you settle anything visavis severance is the following .... they will almost certainly ask you to sign a non-compete with whatever it is they offer to settle on .... think VERY seriously before you do and be sure to have a chat with your suppliers ... if they havent already called to find out 'the real story'  In my case I said no way to the non-compete... and  I quickly found out that not only my customers, but my suppliers and most of the folks who worked around me wanted me to start my own business ... doing what we always did ... except now without the restrictions from non-believers and more importantly without worrying about little pricks like that who undermine instead of helping people.  Today my business is bigger than the one that turfed me and we kick their butt every time we meet on the dance floor ... why ... because nice guys DO NOT finish last ... and we keep getting invited back to the party !  Stay the course my friend this may be the biggest opportunity to do something you would have never considered until you got one upthebutt ... now however, all bets are off ... your friends will stay your friends and will likely (as we've already seen above) be thrilled to have the chance to help you get a running start.   Think about it seriously... you would be shocked how many successful businesses were started under exactly these conditions."
28910,1leggedangler,2007-01-31 12:58:00,364,"Sorry to hear about this most unfortunate incident Cliff. Sure makes you think about the lack of decent courtesy in today's society. Good luck in whatever your next move is but rest assured knowing your integrity is in tack. The company's loss for sure!  Cheers, 1leg"
28955,Darrell,2007-01-31 14:46:00,27,Cliff check your P.M
28974,Spiel,2007-01-31 15:47:00,9065,"....Brutal, don't know how I missed this one? I'd be surprised if your not re-employed in short order Cliff."
29155,bigbuck,2007-01-31 21:56:00,2449,"B/C, sorry to hear about that. From your last update, it's sounds as if one of your old suppliers might end up being interested in your services. Sometimes when you help someone out, you get the long shaft. BUT it makes you feel good at the time. I haven't met you but if you are like most of the people on this board, you are probably a good guy and things will work out for you. They always seem to for good people over time. Good Luck and I'll second the 'no competition clauses'. Say NO!!!"
28681,Big Cliff,2007-01-30 21:45:00,6899,"I can't tell you how much all of your replys, Pms, and phone calls have ment to me. I have tried really hard to turn today into something positive. (I kind of feel like I have lost a friend or something).  Talked to a Lawyer, it seems that because of my position with the company, my age, and even though I was only there 15 months, I can probably get about 3 months severance if I push for it ( I WILL be PUSHING for it!!!!!!)  I have had phone calls from a couple of dealers now telling me they will not deal with the company (not because of what they did to me but they were only dealing with the company because of me). Thank you for your loyality and respect!  I don't know how word is spreading so fast but one of our biggest supliers just phoned me to tell me that he couldn't believe what had happened and that they wouldn't even be in Canada if it wasn't for me. He asked if he could call me back in a week or two because he wants to ""consider some options""!  Tybo  You sure do know how to make a man laugh! (trust me, I thought of doing it myself but I'm old enough that even if I win it still hurts LOL.) It did make me   though. Thank you!  To each and every one of you that took the time to reply to this thread in what ever manner; you are why I am proud to be an OFNr!"
28683,Deano,2007-01-30 21:51:00,767,"I stopped working also in Dec, not exactly the same story, but look on the bright side, lots more time for fishing."
28684,davew3,2007-01-30 21:54:00,430,"Hi Cliff, I haven't had the chance to meet you but from what I am reading there is going to be one sorry business man out there soon. Also looks like things will work out for you. regards."
28685,irishfield,2007-01-30 22:01:00,26272,"Cliff..just keep your chine up, reline those ice rods and plug forward. Forget the lawyer (sorry Kirk/Marty) he's just going to cost you more money than you'll be able to get...and the most you can get out of the employer by Ontario regs is 1 week for every year or part of, of continuous employement...so they owe you 2 weeks pay for not giving you notice of termination. Nothing more..nothing less well except 4% vac pay."
28686,fishindevil,2007-01-30 22:03:00,6254,"sorry to hear that cliff,i work for the school borad and THERE IS SO MUCH OF THAT ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY...ITS EVERYWHERE...AND IM GLAD TO SAY IVE NEVER KISSED NOBODYS *** and never will.."
28688,Meely,2007-01-30 22:05:00,282,"Hiya Cliff,  Sorry to hear of your plight. If it were me.....I would have opened up the exact same business for myself the very next day. Funny how fate knocks on our door at times.......  Sometimes....ya gotta answer...  Best of luck...  Meely"
28697,Carp,2007-01-30 22:30:00,1488,"     $200 each Gerrit ?  This is our friend Cliff. I think we can wave any service fees on this one.  It would be an extreme pleasure to help you out Cliff, free of charge.  I've been through similar situations a couple of times and even though being angry and frustrated is very easy, I didn't let it get to me. Just looked at it as a sign to move on to something better."
28747,JerseyDog,2007-01-31 00:46:00,190,"Sorry to hear, but I have always felt these things are never as bad as they seem. Obviously you worked for idiots and in the long run, that can't be a good thing so its better to find out now then later.  In the always interesting words of Mr. Trump:  ""What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate."""
28764,Garyv,2007-01-31 01:14:00,547,"Cliff, You have a long PM from me!"
28778,Loonietoon,2007-01-31 01:32:00,1450,
28787,express168,2007-01-31 01:43:00,327,"sorry to hearCliff, not everybody has a chance to work at what they enjoy like you said you did. Hope for the best and I gaurantee that you are going to make another company very successful soon."
28576,JFR,2007-01-30 17:07:00,498,"That really sucks  I know its in most of us to reach out and help some person, but when that same person turns on you just for advancement, it can partially destroy your faith in human beings.  He will get his rewards at some point."
28578,Tybo,2007-01-30 17:11:00,1373,"That really sucks Cliff. Cliff if you really want the job back. give me a name. I won't give details, because laws will and other things get broken"
