I was fishing 15 FOW.. the weather would have been alot nicer had the wind died down a bit..   Anyways i just thought I would let those of you going tommorrow know what was going on.. Full moon is coming soon no? Wonder what the fishing will be like...    Gerritt.  Those of you coming please send me a pm if you dont have my number.  Bill still need bait?"
