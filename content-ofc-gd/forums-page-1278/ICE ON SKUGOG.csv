28728,GNODDY,2007-01-31 00:09:00,163,"Hey Man, I was up at Scugy today and there was a truck driving around on it so it should be good for a sled at least. I wouldnt go so far as to drive a vehicle on it but I would take a sled."
28748,dououie,2007-01-31 00:47:00,2,"thanks, i heard ther were vehicles on it already, i just couldnt beleive it, oh well not my vehicle, where you were fishing how much ice was there???? Just curious."
28833,eyefish,2007-01-31 03:13:00,135,lots of ice on the west side of the lake...I would say 10-12 inches anyway! not sure about the east side
28844,kemper,2007-01-31 03:39:00,2232,"Lots of ice around town, but only 4-5 inches off the cessearea side."
28860,Carp,2007-01-31 04:12:00,1488,There were cars and trucks on Cook's Bay last weekend. Some people are just asking for trouble. Reports say 7/8 inches of ice as of last weekend. I'd like twice that before driving on.
29030,Entropy,2007-01-31 17:28:00,747,"I was at Cesarea last eve, there was a car, suv, and full size dodge (drove across the whole lake), out there.  Not me no thanks."
29076,wuchikubo,2007-01-31 18:49:00,1114,"I was there at Caesarea on Sunday, out in the middle of the lake it was only 5"", not safe for a car IMO. Lots of sleds zipping around, I didn't see anything larger than a sled or ATV out on the lake while I was there.  HF"
29105,Fishnfiend,2007-01-31 20:07:00,357,"I was north of ceserea on the weekend.  There was 5-8 inches of ice.  I saw lots of sleds (doing radar runs) and lots of atv's.  I saw a sidekick/tracker with huge tires driving around, but he stuck pretty close to shore.  Probably would have floated with those tires anyway.  My truck stayed on shore and I walked."
