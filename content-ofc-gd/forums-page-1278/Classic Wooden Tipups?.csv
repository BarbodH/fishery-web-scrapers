28759,urbanangler1990,2007-01-31 00:58:00,933,anyone?
28760,steverowbotham,2007-01-31 00:59:00,1800,just feed it line if it starts running.  I've caught 15 pound lakers and ling on a classic tipup.  It's not as bad as it may seem.
28780,nightbow,2007-01-31 01:33:00,7,I have only used wooded tip up stick to fish with for over 28 years now and have never lost a stick down the hole. when the fish run u just let the line slide through your fingers . I jig with these sticks as well if u r in shallow water then I take a spool of line and tie a snap swivel to the line and attach it to the stick so if the fish run I can let the stick go down the hole and still pull the line back

If you are using live bait, after you send it down to the desired depth walk back about 20 feeet and plant it in the snow cover the hole and go have lunch, Seeing that stick flying across the ice is somehting and when it reaches the hole the hook is set by the fish. I have two roods and never used them at all."
