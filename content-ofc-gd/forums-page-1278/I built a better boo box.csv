28967,mattyk,2007-01-31 15:25:00,2110,Nice going Lew. You are the man!
28713,lew,2007-01-30 23:48:00,12767,"One of the main problems with being a musky fisherman is the baits are so darned big, it can be a probem storing and transporting them all the time.  I converted my live well to a bait storage box and usually have anywhere from 70 - 80 bucktails in there, but I also use alot of large boo-tails anywhere from 10 - 13"" long and was running out of places for them and couldn't find a decent box to carry them in, so I figured if I can't find what I want, I may as well build it.  Nice easy project to build and the price was only a fraction of what a musky box big enough for these 35 boo-tails and large spinnerbaits would cost me.  22"" X 13"" X 14"" with 1/4 inch rods to hang the baits on.  The air holes are to allow circulation for the mariboo to dry when I'm done with them for the day.    Still room to add a few more baits.    And I even found some jewellery to decorate the box with    It'll sit on the front deck right in front of the console and will be much easier now that I've got them all in the same place.  Nuthin fancy, but it's a nice little project to work on and I thought some of y'all may be interested  Next project is finding a spot for all the body baits"
28718,trapshooter,2007-01-30 23:53:00,1234,"Looks good enough to market and sell Lew!  Nice job.  Cheers, ben."
28720,douG,2007-01-30 23:56:00,2693,"Very nice Lew.  Is the bottom set into the sides and are the vertical corners butted, lapped, mitered or rabbeted?  Finger joints or dovetails would be just too too.  Just curious.  Regardless, very pretty work.  Put a handle on the lid and I'll take two."
28722,irishfield,2007-01-30 23:59:00,26272,Looks great Lew! Very similar to what Kristal built me for Christmas last year.  Now about them thar holes....are they going to help them dry out...or get wet when it rains!   LOL
28723,Roy,2007-01-31 00:01:00,13728,"Really nice, Lew!  You did a good job there for sure. Now where are the dang handles so as I can grab it out of your boat!"
28727,Eddyk,2007-01-31 00:08:00,195,When your not using it for fishing you can put your vicious little dog in it so he doesnt bite people.
28732,Roy,2007-01-31 00:16:00,13728,hahahahaha   I think the neighbour's kids would be in there way before Marvin.
28733,DT10Sam,2007-01-31 00:19:00,480,"Nice work Lew, get a patent on it before they get mass produced.  Regards, Sam"
28734,ccmtcanada,2007-01-31 00:23:00,7971,Wow!! Great job Lew...how much are you charging for those?? haha.  The OFC Sticker is a great touch too.
28750,Joey,2007-01-31 00:48:00,9122,That's awesome.  We're always on the hunt for a box for our musky baits.  I'll put my order in now Lew     Seriously!!!  Joey
28753,Handlebarz,2007-01-31 00:54:00,3790,I like yer box Lew I have plans in the works to make a new one for myself also just need the time to get it done.
28758,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-31 00:58:00,0,"It looks great Lew, nice job"
28768,Garyv,2007-01-31 01:17:00,547,"Lew, I think that Senior Wenches had one like that years ago on the Ed Sullivan show.  Worked for him should work fine for you!"
28770,Whopper,2007-01-31 01:22:00,2174,Well done Lew!
28786,GbayGiant,2007-01-31 01:42:00,1780,"Nice job, looks well built."
28793,brickNblock,2007-01-31 01:49:00,598,"Awesome Lew........................awesome. That new box of yours just relieved a large headache for me as to where to put all the Boo-tails. At best, storage is right out front  of you on your wind screen, at least to manage better drying for the Boo. Storage  + Drying..............= Priceless You know I have more Bootails then I need and this is just what the doc..(Lew), ordered........ I'll have a system in place similar when we meet up this comming fall....(w/eddyk), should-a had a patent on it....you'll know it soon as you see it Bud. Again Lew.........very awesome idea....that box of your'n will keep them tails from flying off your screen into your face and at the very least and even more important..('cuz you can always duck them flying).........is that they'll be ready to use just when you want them..niceNdry...........WTG Lew......WTG"
28802,Nanook,2007-01-31 02:06:00,565,"  Nice job there Lew,Carpenter on the side ,eh! So you're not only a pretty face"
28913,1leggedangler,2007-01-31 13:04:00,364,"Beauty work Lew, Love the quick dry system. I don't see where to order on-line though?  Cheers, 1leg"
28915,crappiesteve,2007-01-31 13:10:00,220,"Lew,very nice indeed  Steve"
28917,lew,2007-01-31 13:21:00,12767,"Thanks folks, like I said, nuthin fancy, but I don't think the fish really care, and besides, it's always a good thing when we can do something ourselves and save a few $$$$"
28923,jediangler,2007-01-31 13:40:00,1923,"Nice work. Soon you'll be fishing out of a tackle box, with a hull, rather than a boat full of baits."
28927,BITEME,2007-01-31 13:46:00,1969,Nice Job Lew!!!!!!
28935,dustink,2007-01-31 14:07:00,526,"Nice job, Lew!!  Nice winter project for sure.  dk"
28939,John,2007-01-31 14:12:00,2956,"Nice job Lew. At first I figured that the holes were to keep the ""livebait"" breathing...."
28962,Bly,2007-01-31 15:02:00,1556,"Great work!  I am going to save that picture for future reference if that is ok with you.  Of course, should you decide to mass produce.....put me down for one  Thanks for sharing! Bly"
