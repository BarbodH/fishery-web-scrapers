29468,taper,2007-02-01 15:38:00,611,"I want to purchase a new rod and reel ( not necessary to be a combo ) to fish 98% of the time for pike and the odd time for musky. I throw a lot of spoons and spinners and troll very little. I currently use a spinning rod and reel combination and it works quite well but would like to go up to a baitcaster for the extra power and strength of the reel. Most of my fishing is from a boat. I was considering the Pete Maina combo at BPS but it only comes one side retrieve ( I think right ) and I use left on my spincast and think I would like the baitcaster to be the same. What would you guys recomend, by the way the baitcaster is a new thing to me so a user friendly model would be good if there is such a thing."
29469,Raf,2007-02-01 15:41:00,3495,Abu Garcia 6501 C3 is propably the best bang for your buck going in a lefty.  You could propably get away with a 5501C3 if you don't do much fishing with obnoxiously large baits.
29475,mattyk,2007-02-01 15:58:00,2110,Try the new shimano curado 300.
29486,bigbuck,2007-02-01 16:55:00,2449,How much do you want to spend??? That's usually a pretty good starting point. A nice Calcutta and a Legend Elite will set you back 800 or so. Or a decent rod and reel for under 200?? (Abu C3 and a Shimano convergence).
29489,BabyHerc,2007-02-01 17:01:00,285,"The above reel choices are great, and, to reiterate, the Abu is the best bang for the buck.  For a cross-over rod, check out the 7'3"" St. Croix Avid.  It's rated for 3/8-1-1/4 oz, and is telescopic.  It makes a great pike rod, and can cross over into light or medium muskie fishing, as well as being a flipping rod for bass.  It should be a tad over $200 at most places."
29490,urbanangler1990,2007-02-01 17:05:00,933,"i fish pike and bass usually and use a shimano callisto for both, great reel for price between 50-65, 6:1 speed... i toss exactly what u mentioned, spoons, and big spnners, also hard jerkbaits... another good reel is the quantuam  Icon 3 Bearings | DynaMag | Composite Frame | 5.1:1 Gear Ratio  i bought is at LB's as a combo for 50 or 60 bux  hope this helps"
