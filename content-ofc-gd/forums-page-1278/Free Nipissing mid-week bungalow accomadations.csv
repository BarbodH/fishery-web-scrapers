28566,RandyB,2007-01-30 16:40:00,8,"Hey yall , Randy ( Cowpoke ) here , just wanted to throw the freebie offer out here to a deserving member of OFC . The mid-week dates of Feb 19-22 a friend and I have booked a super bungalow with Rob Hyatt , we had to pay for three people in order to stay in the larger hut ,(I was afraid a normal sized one wouldn't hold enough beer ) anyway this means that we have a FREE space for anyone who would like to take advantage of it . Minimal requirements being that you can put up with a couple of crazy americans for a few days , that you don't mind being cooped up with a coupla smokers , you have to be able to hold your liquor while remaining as safe as possible , and a love of hippie music helps .  We also are looking for a guide service for at least one day to venture out to different spots so any suggestions on that would be a big help also . Thanks for looking , and TJ the offer is open to you also if you are crazy enough to take me up on it . Randy"
28573,tonyb,2007-01-30 17:01:00,1637,"Man that is great offer!  Are you looking for a guide to take you out to different areas while you have the Bungalow, or are you talking after your trip to Nippissing?  Tony"
28599,1leggedangler,2007-01-30 17:59:00,364,"Very nice gesture indeed, hope you find a good wingman, sounds like it will be fun couple of days."
28600,irishfield,2007-01-30 18:00:00,26272,Sorry Bud..one afternoon in the boat with you was enough! LOL   J/K  Have a GREAT time Randy! I'm sure someone here will be game.
28615,douG,2007-01-30 18:28:00,2693,"Hey, Cowpoke.  Sounds like a memorable trip for sure.  Good Luck!"
28618,RandyB,2007-01-30 18:47:00,8,"I am hoping to get out with a guide for a day while we are there . Three or four days in a hut without moving around would leave a seriuos mark !  I am really looking to put my buddy onto at least one or two nice pike , so I figure a little moving around should increase our odds .  I looked at Ice Guides and Profishtangles and neither seemed to be a fit so hoping to get some other options . They don't need to be a professional just have a knowledge of the lake . By the way we will be traveling thru Tronoto so transportation can be supplied ."
28625,cisco,2007-01-30 19:13:00,597,"That's a really nice offer!  Big pike seem to be caught close to islands. Right tight to the town of Callander has some beauts close to the islands there.  As for someone guiding you a bit, just seems a tough job without a snowmobile or ATC since where your hut's gonna be is not within easy walking distance of any other hotspots. Talk to the operator since they seem more than helpful in relocating you to another hut that more fish seem to be coming out of... if any are empty for a day.  Hope you guys have a great trip!"
28627,Zib,2007-01-30 19:22:00,369,"I almost took you up on your offer. I can put up with crazy Americans because I'm one myself, I can hold my liquor, but I can't put up with the smoke."
28631,tributaryhunter,2007-01-30 19:30:00,108,i'm in for sure if you want to give me a shout my number is 519 753-5059 i was suppose to go up the 23rd weekend but no wanted to go so i canceled it
28698,Woodsman,2007-01-30 22:30:00,1286,Great offer Randy. If it wasn't mid week I would of jumped at the offer. If I remember correctly we met on Lake Simcoe early March last year. Best Wishes: Rick
28699,Eddyk,2007-01-30 22:38:00,195,Where exactly is Tronoto ? LOL
28761,RandyB,2007-01-31 01:01:00,8,"Sorry for the mispelling EddyK , I must have gotten confused with the Big Smoke ."
28795,Northhunter,2007-01-31 01:51:00,214,"I wish I could take you up on the offer (a crazy canuck is crazier than a crazy american!). I like a nicotine fix when I drink, but don't care for the smoke indoors. I've grown up fishing the lake, but am not familiar with that part of it."
28914,RandyB,2007-01-31 13:07:00,8,Just one taker so far ? Tributaryhunter seems interesred but for some strange reason TJQ has been stangely quiet . Surely I didn't scare you that bad TJ .
