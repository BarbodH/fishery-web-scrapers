24543,FinS,2007-01-20 19:06:00,463,Well checked out LSC this morning and i was impressed good layer of ice starting to form up we just might get to see a hard water season this year after all as long as the temps stay low hopefully we will have some good ice by the 2nd week in february happy fishing  FinS
24674,Zib,2007-01-21 00:47:00,369,I gave up fishing LSC a long time ago. Seeing too many Coast Guard rescues made me stay away. It amazes me to see a guy get rescued from a section of ice that breaks off & starts floating across the lake & then turn around & head right back out to fish. My life is more important than a couple of perch.

24884,smellin fishy,2007-01-21 19:09:00,21,"Zib, I agree with you.  My life is more important than perch and not worth the kind of money that the tax payers have to pay for the rescue."
24888,Mike Pike,2007-01-21 19:51:00,1332,"Good luck, FinS.  I hope you guys get yourselves a season out there.  I used to ice-fish with my Uncle on St. Clair years ago( Stoney Point? )so I have a soft spot for the lake.  Most of my ice-fishing now is done on Lake Simcoe( Cooks Bay )which usually freezes nice and early, except for this year, of course."
24950,Handlebarz,2007-01-22 00:44:00,3790,"well it looks like there was about 1mm of ice along some of the sore of the thames in Chatham today it will be a long time before it has enough to get out on. Heck last year there was way to many people on it with 2"" max before it broke up. I hope that we get some ice it will be another long winter just like last year.  Hey Steve I bet you would be out there if we could fish muskie throught the ice now that would be different"
29215,FinS,2007-02-01 00:01:00,463,"well the ice has finally got here been about 1 week and a half now solid 5-6 "" atv's and sleds out in some areas but still limited to other areas of the lake after this big cold spell everything looks good the bite is great never had so much fun during the winter have fun and be safe  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...ie.143.250m.jpg"
