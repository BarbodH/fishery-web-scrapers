29384,Mattitude,2007-02-01 11:20:00,155,Been out of the loop a while but i finally got myself logged in to the new board properly.  Its good to see everyone again.  I'm sure this is a repost but how do I get my old post counts back.  I don't want to be a newbie all over again.
29386,Rich Clemens,2007-02-01 11:26:00,3131,Drop a PM to a mod and include your old post count ... or at least a rough idea on what it was.  That's what we did when we switched to the new board.  Should be able to take care of it for ya.

29394,Mattitude,2007-02-01 12:02:00,155,"Thanks guys, I'll do that.  I haven't been out yet,  but a trip out to Sparrow Lake for Walleye and or Pike is being planned for Mid February.  Good to see you again Misfish!  Now if I can just figure out the avatars and personal info LOL"

I didn't worry about my post count, it made me feel younger  But as said, get hold of a mod and you should be able to recover your standing."
29402,Spiel,2007-02-01 12:45:00,9065,....Welcome back Matt. I can change your post count if you remember what it was. I'm unable to retrieve it myself as the old board is gone.
