I need it for warmth as I have bad circulation problems in my feet and can't stay out in the cold very long even with really good boots....plus I have no ice hut either....any help would be great....last I heard there was like 6-8"" there!"
29278,Gerritt,2007-02-01 01:39:00,6129,"Well I hate to say it..... but no Ice is ever 100% safe... and I will not advocate driving on 6"" and that is the last you heard not what you acually KNOW.  Me personally I wouldn't risk it.   Gerritt."
29327,JerseyDog,2007-02-01 02:47:00,190,"You just gave me the greatest idea. Buy an old beater van and rig the back for ice fishing. Might even do a Cam Wooley special and drill some 8"" holes in the floor boards.  As for your dilemma, the solution is simple - wait for the guys with the big utes and 150's - follow thier tracks. While nothing in life is 100%, being a follower is sometimes the best plan!"

29420,cityfisher,2007-02-01 14:07:00,959, heat packs work decent but battery operated socks are crap .. or atleast the 2 types ive tried... both didnt do a thing....  I wouldnt drive my car on the ice with ATLEAST 12 inches of ice.. buts thats just me
