What you will notice first is the additions to the edit and posting features. You can do alot more stuff while posting including linking back to another post (this will be very handy, trust me). You will also notice two very large changes which come in very handy on a fishing site. First, we have a massively expanded personal profile area. This allows you to create a comprehensive self portrait and allows you to track messages, assign friends and alot more. The biggest new addition is the Blog component. These things are everywhere now. Yours is built right in. Create a blog from your control area and then you will see a 'My Blog' feature link up top. Should be right beside 'My Album' These blogs will be of use to everyone. You can set it private and use it to track fishing success rates. Guides and lodge owners can use them to keep everyone up to date with how things are going and not have to spam the forum. Blogs get indexed very well by search engines, so they are of great use to those in the pro end of fishing. We have a new Computer Help Center set up. In there Gerritt (and hopefully soon to be another member I can't seem to get a hold of) will be able to help you with questions about this site, the internet and your computer in general. So far we haven't run into any major issues. I was concerned about cookies and the new board cause the new system uses alot more security features to prevent hacking. By far and away this is the safest forum software on the internet now. Prior to it being launched it was put to a security group to try and destroy. Their input led to some changes in the way all the private information flows. You can also now post an embedded URL for displaying videos on You Tube or Google rather than just a regular link. The video shows up right on the site."
