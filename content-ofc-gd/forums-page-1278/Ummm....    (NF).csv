29256,Joey,2007-02-01 01:27:00,9122,"Well, its definately not a horse.  You can tell just by the nose, but also the neck and back.  Looks like a moose to me.  Its just the antlers look so close to the head.  Neat for sure tho.  Surprised a moose would take the bit like that.  Joey"
29280,irishfield,2007-02-01 01:41:00,26272,Amazing what you can get an animal to do after it's been castrated.
