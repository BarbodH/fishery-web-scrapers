29079,lew,2007-01-31 18:59:00,12767,"Look on the bright side Paul, at least it'll be easier to handle than that 18 wheeler you wrestled around town for all those years."
29081,irishfield,2007-01-31 19:00:00,26272,Flame job on the paint and some knobby tires to get you down to the fishin hole and you're all set Paul !
29082,Greencoachdog,2007-01-31 19:00:00,8163,"Congratulations Paul, I'm sure this will bring you a new mobility and make ""life in the fast lane"" easier for you."
29089,Big Cliff,2007-01-31 19:23:00,6899,I bet if cross a couple of wires and hook an old sewing machine motor up to it with a little nitro we can get it to do 0-60. (Tim The Tool Man is my hero LOL).  One or two good runs and camo won't be needed anymore
29090,motv8tr,2007-01-31 19:26:00,2587,"Looks nice Paul, one of the nicer one's I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them.  Maureen"
29098,cisco,2007-01-31 19:49:00,597,Great looking ride Paul! Nice to hear you gettin more mobile.
29102,OhioFisherman,2007-01-31 20:02:00,6623,"LOL baloon tires, wonder if that rascal will float? Just my thinking a new boat would have been a better re-tirement plan!  Thanks peoples! You just never know? LOL"
29103,kennyman,2007-01-31 20:03:00,737,"I do run a performance shop. Hmm, I mostly deal with North American muscle cars,but I think we can work something out. I have a buddy,that drag races an electric motorcycle and is quite knowledgeable. He wants to build an electric drag car in the future. It's incredible the h/p and torque you can get from electric motors. They're consistent and reliable. They just don't sound the same though. Let me know if I can ""hook you up""."
29138,Whopper,2007-01-31 21:17:00,2174,"Alrighty Paul!  Good too see ya got a new ride!  Now the question I have for you, are you ready for a road trip ?  Whopper"
29139,fishergirl72,2007-01-31 21:27:00,455,CONGRATS PAUL!!!   Nice ride you got yourself there!
29241,Garyv,2007-02-01 00:42:00,547,"Jimmy, a friend  of mine had one of those.  He rigged a rod holder and tackle box to it, a place to put his thermos and some lunch and he would go from his house the 2 or 3 mile trip to the government docks in Sarnia and fish every day he could.  It should really help with your mobility, I know he was thrilled when he got his.  Good luck and be careful trolling piers should you decide to give it a try!"
29293,Beans,2007-02-01 01:56:00,3339,Nice Paul...I hope this gets you out to the old fishin' hole more...
