28852,Rich,2007-01-31 03:52:00,3927,Nope no fish.. this ice season has started off terrible for me. 3 skunks on 5 different waterbodies. Hopefully tomorrow I can post with some better results.   The Lake   The Setup  Better luck next time.
28853,Spiel,2007-01-31 03:54:00,9065,....You couldn't have worse luck!
28859,Carp,2007-01-31 04:08:00,1488,Lost the touch Richard ???  No worries bud. Keep at it. The fish will come.
28937,joonmoon,2007-01-31 14:09:00,528,"Screw the peanuts Rich, they have proven of late to be nothing but snacks, no luck involved. Go back to the apple fritters and brown pops, or fireball...lol. Keep at er Rich ""if you book them they will come"" lol. We will have to get together soon and discuss the finer things in life and as soon as you aren't paying attention to the rods they will pop off and FISH ON. Good luck."
