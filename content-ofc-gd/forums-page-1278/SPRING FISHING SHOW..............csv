29037,charlesn,2007-01-31 17:30:00,551,"I will be there Sat and Sun.  Most likely just hanging out/loitering in the CFT booth or the WFN booth with JPD.  He's doing some hawg tank seminars that should be worth the time.  If nothing else, you can go to heckle him.  haha  Charles"
29040,misfish,2007-01-31 17:33:00,29133,"Whos there Friday Charles ?  Heckel JPD,you better be able to run fast then.LOL"
29051,Garyv,2007-01-31 17:52:00,547,"Up until a few years ago a friend of mine was in charge of the show, I may be prejudiced but I went every year with a few friends spent some money and really enjoyed the Spring Show.  Since she is no longer with OOD I have witnessed a decline in the overall show, and this has been confirmed many posts on the OFC as well as other boards.  For me to drive 2+ hours one way, stop for 2 to 3 meals and spend money to visit a show that simply doesn't measure up to the past  does not make sense, so it's no go for us this year.  I will however go to the London show as I'm working one of the booths selling Salmon Derby tickets for Bluewater Anglers on Sunday!"
29052,knotaclue,2007-01-31 17:56:00,136,"After last year i'll keep my money,my wife and girls have more fun at bass pro"
29057,charlesn,2007-01-31 18:01:00,551,"Brian, the CRK CFT staff should be there all days.  JP will probably be there most days working with WFN.  I could be as fast as Ben Johnson and not be safe from JP, he knows where I live.  lol  Charles"
29062,davis,2007-01-31 18:17:00,128,I only go to stock up on Carmichael's spicy turkey sausage...mmmm....and maybe another rod and reel for the wife.  also helps that I can get my hands on free passes too

29075,Eddyk,2007-01-31 18:45:00,195,"For those of you in Eastern Ontario theres the Ottawa Boat, Sportsman show and Cottage Show at Lansdowne Park Feb. 22 to 25."
29312,John Bacon,2007-02-01 02:23:00,3277,  Join a fishing club that operates a booth.  Metro East Anglers will be operating a booth; members can get in free in exchange for working at the booth for a few hours.
28570,JFR,2007-01-30 16:56:00,498,"Is only 16 days away  , Who is going and what day.  I usually go on opening day, but since I have a previous appointment, my missus and I will be there on Friday, from opening until whenever......  If there is enough OFC members each day, a mini swill is in order.  TJ and Monique are you planning on making an apprearance this year?  John"
28582,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-30 17:18:00,1351,huh? when? where!?

28620,irishfield,2007-01-30 18:51:00,26272,I don't know John..I already had to buy a bigger boat for all my gear. I probably should stay out of a place like that..LOL
28645,dsn,2007-01-30 20:00:00,1018,I might show up.  Since I have the $1.00 off coupon from LeBarons and Onatrio Out Doors Magazine has a $2.00 off coupon and if you buy you tickets online you also get a $1.00 off.  If I keep searching I might find away to get in free.   dsn
28658,Gerritt,2007-01-30 20:33:00,6129,"Hmmm... I was just looking at the list.... interesting.. is it just me or does it seem as though every year it gets less and less fishing related? I mean a Baked goods and deli booth? corn on the cob.ca?? and a ton of resorts... mind you I like looking at the brochures. But will probably never book with most of them... I do see Aaron has a seminar... Aaron what day will it be and around what time?  whatever happened to getting a bargin on fishing stuff? To be honest I dont think from my previous experiances at the Spring Show, I dont see the deals being that substantial...and surely once you factor in the drive and the admission many times you pay more!  I see fishing world is there I should ask em what sorta deals they plan on having to decide weather the trip to toronto and 12 bux is worth it.  Just my thoughts....  Gerritt."
28665,SlowPoke,2007-01-30 20:52:00,2984,"I'll be heading to the London fishing show.... but.... When going to these shows, try to forget the bargains in the old days, cost of admission/parking etc. Go for the entertainment value, check out new products, check out seminars and enjoy yourself. It's still cheaper than going to the movies! Some of my best memories of past shows include the introduction of Shimano ""Super Stopper"" reels, the awe inspiring Advanced Taxidermy displays and the build of anticipation for the coming season. I can't for the life of me remember any of the deals I got over the years! -Brian"

28838,Tomcat,2007-01-31 03:26:00,395,Here's a copy of the email response I received today about the lack of an on-line exhibitor list for the 2007 show:  We are currently working on 07 exhibitor list for the web. We have over 40 new exhibitors. I hope to have the 07 exhibitor list on the web no later than Feb.7/07. Preferably sooner.
28845,fish4me,2007-01-31 03:40:00,59,Is Gagnon's going to be there?
28846,eyefish,2007-01-31 03:45:00,135,don't think so....I don't think they do shows anymore...at least not in the last 3-4 years anyway
