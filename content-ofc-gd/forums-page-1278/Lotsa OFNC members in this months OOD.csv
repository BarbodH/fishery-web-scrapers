I spotted bly, Rich (the angler formerly known as BBR) and Shad...  Who else is in there?   I am not in case you were wondering...which you probably weren't."
28857,ccmtcanada,2007-01-31 04:05:00,7971,"Hey Rick....could you scan the page and add it to the thread?  Also...if there is anyone out there who receives the OFAH version and is NOT keeping it, I'd be interested in buying it from you.  It's not every day my wife (Bly) is in a fishing magazine!!  Thanks...  Cliff"

28926,lew,2007-01-31 13:44:00,12767," Wassup Raf, your not suggesting fishermen exaggerate are you ??"
28930,ehg,2007-01-31 13:56:00,2666," I was thinking the same thing about all Largemouth entries over 26 inches. Any pictures?  But anyways, good to see Stan Sharp (fishinfool) in the walleye category.  ehg"

29204,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-01-31 23:50:00,0,I know the guy tied for forth place in the Muskie category was an OFC member at the time he came and fished with me and caught his 53.5 inch fish.  :-)  I can't believe the number of 8++ pound bass caught in Ontario. Mine was a fat 22 x 15 and weighted 6 lbs 10 onzes.
