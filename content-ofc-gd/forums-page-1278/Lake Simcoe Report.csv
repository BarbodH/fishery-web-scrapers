28771,Clampet,2007-01-31 01:23:00,1947,"Dave Masse and I decided to give it a go for the Perch at Cooks Bay. We went to a spot Dave had success with a few days ago. We were set-up for fishing by 9:20 AM.    I beleive the key was green coontail weeds which hosted tiny scud, a type of fresh water shrimp, if I am not mistaken.  You can see them clinging to the weeds.  The Perch we caught were what some consider to be ""dinks"", but I wanted to have a feed, so I kept them. We tried moving to deeper water, but did not catch anything. After trying two other spots, all by walking, we returned to the 1st one and caught some more. The action was really non stop.  As soon as you got your offering on bottom and lifted 2-6 inches, tap, tap, there was another. A steady lifting motion proved their undoing.  If I tried setting the hook, it always resulted in yanking the bait out of their tiny mouths.  Also, the time I spent sharpening my hooks the night b4 proved to be time well spent.  We were paid a visit by a Conservation Officer, Mitch, who was anxipous about having his picture taken. In the photo, It looks like Dave is slapping him, but he is really obliging the CO by covering his face, which as you can see is unnecessary, as the CO had pulled down his riding safety helmet.   On one of our forays looking for another spot we came across Rico Boxing.  I got him to demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of a manual Swede Bore auger, which features an off-set handle.  I saw first hand how much quicker it bore a hole over the old type inline handle Mora auger.  Rico was on his way back, and when I looked he actually ran the whole 3/4 mile ( 1Km) to shore.  He is in great shape!  So I managed a total of 29 Perch, and Dave had the requisite 25 on his conservation license.   On the way back I took the time to take a pic of some young future possible NHL fodder playing a game of hockey on the ice that they or someone had scraped.  It was good to watch them play, with all their youthfull energy.  I myself was winded from the walk. "

28940,Disspatcher,2007-01-31 14:13:00,73,Nice Fish....25 more and you had one hell of a feed! Congrats.
28946,Fisherman,2007-01-31 14:31:00,7201,"The only thing I didn't like out there yesterday were the 2 Astro vans driving around, 8 inches of ice and water geysers are not amusing."
28948,Joey,2007-01-31 14:32:00,9122,Great report Paul.  How many of those little suckers did it take to make one sandwich  We just bought that Fin Bore and it is so much faster than the Swede Bore.  Money well spent for sure.  Joey
28952,Terry,2007-01-31 14:42:00,14456,I would have told everyone that he was carp slapping the Co..makes for a better story... looks like a good day on the ice
28969,Mike Pike,2007-01-31 15:27:00,1332,Nice report and pics guys.  A good time and some fish for the fry pan.  The Finbore is a great auger!  Makes quick work of drilling with not too much effort so you don't mind jumping around to different spots chasing the schools.
28979,douG,2007-01-31 16:09:00,2693,"Nice report, Clampet, and the snapshots are welcome, too.  Thanks."
28984,Rob,2007-01-31 16:16:00,467,I guess Ellie May had a good time cleaning those perch!!! YEEEHAW!!   Rob C
28999,steverowbotham,2007-01-31 16:39:00,1800,"My mom and dad bought me a fin-bore for my birthday, it is so nice, cuts like nothing."
29207,wuchikubo,2007-01-31 23:51:00,1114," Hey Paul, good to see you got some feed to take home. As for the question above, I have a finnbore and to my knowledge all the holes I've drilled have been very straight.  I kind of think that it would have to be straight in order to have both blades cutting properly. Initially it may seam to wobble but it does straighten out.  Stan"
29302,chewy,2007-02-01 02:10:00,40,nice report but i dont understand why people keep smaal fish just to be greedy so they can have a fish meal .throw them back and keep the fish population growing
29309,fishindevil,2007-02-01 02:19:00,6254,well looks like you guys had alot of fun ...and a good catch of fish to boot....WTG
29358,GbayGiant,2007-02-01 04:35:00,1780,"The large females are the fish that have all the eggs. Mebbe I's rong, puleese set me right ifn I is.     I wouldn't want to clean all those  , but  the odds of a jumbo having eggs is much greater, I cleaned some jumbos in November that were full of eggs ?  Nice pics by the way."
