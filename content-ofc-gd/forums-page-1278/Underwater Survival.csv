28432,holdfast,2007-01-30 05:35:00,1813,"So, your driving or being driven and you just crashed, and your sinking, or about to sink under water. What steps do you take.   Point form pls?   OH just one thing.  Your seatbelt is ON.  Otherwise, YOUR HISTORY!"
28450,holdfast,2007-01-30 06:48:00,1813,"OK,its the number one move, but you do not touch the seat belt.   soooooo"
28452,holdfast,2007-01-30 07:02:00,1813,What do you do
28497,BITEME,2007-01-30 13:22:00,1969,First thing leave the windows up air is life -As you panic try to stay focused -since I ALWAYS CARRY A BLADE i will cut My seat belt -also in my vehicle i carry an automatic center punch if im in another vehicle I will always be carrying this (ANAL) -since i have electric windows once im ready for exit and have taken a deep breath i will center punch the window and head up -if I had crank windows i would roll the window down -Key to all this is keeping your poop together
28503,blaque,2007-01-30 13:43:00,2419,"Ill be honest, I havent a clue about any of this, wouldnt know what to do, (dont get the seatbelt thing) I will def. be tracking this thread though just in case lol"
28507,Entropy,2007-01-30 14:03:00,747,Maybe someone will dive in and pull your whole car to shore !!!  check this out!!  http://www.mindentimes.ca/webapp/sitepages...=News+%2D+Local
28508,BabyHerc,2007-01-30 14:08:00,285,"Stay calm and open the windows to let water in.  With the cab full of air, you have an unequal pressure balance, making opening the door nearly impossible.  As the cab fills with water, remove excess clothing (jeans, shoes, jacket), otherwise you'll just be an anchor.  Take a final deep breath as the water reaches your head, and with the cab now full of water, the door should be much easier to open.  Climb out and swim for shore."

28679,silveradosheriff,2007-01-30 21:44:00,1025,"Huh, makes a lot of sense.  Fun post indeed!"
28682,fishindevil,2007-01-30 21:48:00,6254,"well thats very interesting report ,ive seen it on the news many times before but never thought about what would i do if it happened to me...even worse what about if you had your family in the car...oh thats scary"
28693,Greencoachdog,2007-01-30 22:21:00,8163,First thing... I will soil myself... then panic!... or is it the other way around?
28901,holdfast,2007-01-31 12:20:00,1813,"I learned from a A Rotary Underwater Egress. ie simulated helicopter crash.  It sinks then flips upside down.  This course is for Military flight crews as well as Off shore Oil crews.  A Canadian invention in Halifax that I have been told that who ever had the course and were alive in a crash that it has been over 90% effective.  Here's what I remember.  1.  Landmark  your escape.  Example beak or open window and leave your hand or arm there as or after you flip or fill with water. 2. Take a breath. 3. Undo your seatbelt with the other hand and pull or push yourself out the exit.  Easier said then done.  But heres the facts.  It will be dark, youll be disorientated, and possibly upside down.  The seatbelt will hold you in place while you open or break the window.  It will give you enough time to think, once you panic its all luck.  I did this about a dozen times.  I would of drowned twice if not for the safety divers.  1st time I landmarked but tryed geting out beside the window- I panicked.  2nd time I did it without a seatbelt and never land marked.  consequently I had no Idea upside down wher the exits were.  An unbelievable course where I learned to overcome fear.  Baby Herc has the best response."
28958,Joey,2007-01-31 14:52:00,9122,"If you have electric windows and the vehicle shuts off on impact or by being overcome by water, then how do you roll down the window?  Joey"
28964,holdfast,2007-01-31 15:08:00,1813,"Break it with your elbow or something.  Its the only way.  Forget the Windshield.  Like I said, easier said then done.  But it is possible.  As one post mentioned, god help if there are kids strapped in.  You got to save yourself first, to save others."
28996,BITEME,2007-01-31 16:33:00,1969,You all might want to look into something like this to keep on your person or in the vehicle  it could save you life  http://www.safehomeproducts.com/shp2/sc/shopexd.asp  in search type escape tool
