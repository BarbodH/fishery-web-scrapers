No more clicking on each buoy! A list of more maps including the entire US, Caribbean & Europe is here: http://www.pdfamily.com/weather/buoy.php"

29480,Whopper,2007-02-01 16:05:00,2174," You are correct MilfordMaWx, the feature about the off shore stations that is nice is the wave height info that the shore sations lack  Cheers Whopper"
