28443,Rich,2007-01-30 06:13:00,3927,"You spring for a pair of waterproof boots yet?  Oh yes, there is a tale of 3 ice fishers destined to find safe ice, and few fish. Maybe I'll let Nauti tell the tale. The evil ice, the crisp frost, and the fishes' reluctance to enjoy our tastiest offerings.  More on this in the AM."
28446,holdfast,2007-01-30 06:29:00,1813,Just to let you guys know.  Im not too partial with people.   Edit: I took the liberty of correcting the spelling of the last word in your sentence.  Please re-read the rules of adhesion to our forum.  Roy
28447,Rich,2007-01-30 06:33:00,3927,"Thanks for letting me know. Oh thank god, it's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm glad we got that out in the open."
28448,holdfast,2007-01-30 06:38:00,1813,"I dont know, but I could be wrong.  It seems to me. That theyre out for themselves and trying to sell./;"
28449,Rich,2007-01-30 06:41:00,3927,Wouldn't know. I dont really know any British people.
28456,Greencoachdog,2007-01-30 07:29:00,8163,Did somebody get wet tootsies??? I'll bet that was cold!!!
28521,LeXXington,2007-01-30 14:45:00,1928,"Looks Guys:  Us Brits need to stick together when fishing..  First get the wellies out, No worries about wet toes... the stiff upper lit is due too the cold not social feelings If extream cold the navy issues RUM shots so it works for me too.  God Save the Queen, now pass the pint of bitter!!!  looking forward too the reports"

28558,Greencoachdog,2007-01-30 16:16:00,8163,  Rum shots eh?... where do I sign up to be British???
28563,lew,2007-01-30 16:30:00,12767," A 'tot' of rum was issued to all sailors of the Commonwealth Navies on a daily basis, but was discontinued a couple decades back.  A sad day indeed for all sailors of her Majesties Senior Service    At least they waited till after I received my discharge though"
28569,nautifish,2007-01-30 16:52:00,1416,Just for the record. I happen to be born Canadian...right here in Ontario .   and i am not partial to misserable old men.
28673,Hellfish,2007-01-30 21:24:00,308,"  Well said.       Just a quick question though, Where is this thread going?? Whats the point of saying that holdfast?? Dont u think thats a grim generalization? Kinda should back up what u say, cause otherwise u look like a miserable old man. I know me being the n00b here i shouldnt chime in and say this but that was just plain rude    Kinda think ur in the wrong place then Holdfast."
28674,Greencoachdog,2007-01-30 21:29:00,8163,  Well!... I guess that counts me and Roy out too then!
29013,nautifish,2007-01-31 17:11:00,1416,"GCD..,..You misserable no way!!  Roy well thats another story......LOL...........  Hellfish....You are allways going to get one in a bunch.  Are not happy unless they have something to gripe about.  I just found it amuseing that because i sound british he assumed i was british. I do not know what exactly was he had said as i have been sick as a dog these last two day's...I was just informed that something not so nice  (racial) had been directed at me apparently. This is not the 1st time from Holdfast.  But one thing you learn quick about the internet., Is these people really are not worth your time.  Enjoy OFC  It really is a great site and welcome aboard."
