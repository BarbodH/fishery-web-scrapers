196938,sash,2008-05-05 20:04:00,26,"just wanted to share some pics and say hi, I had a great hardwater season and couldn't believe my success this season, not only did i catch some nice fish, i also found an unexpected fishing partner.   After watching me prepare for the next mornings outing my girlfriend said i can't understand why u like fishing when u freeze ur butt off,  i replied with  the usual it's only cold till i find the perch then into the portable, about 100 ?'s later she is joining me on an outting.  well i can only wish everyone's 1st time fishing is something close to this, 1 hole each and fish after fish all day and she was hooked.  Well the other day after watching the motogp(i know i'm lucky) she said hey u know how the season closes on ...as she named off a few species...y do they only let ppl catch them during the winter?  well after i told her they open up again she asked y don't u fish in summer, don't u know how? being a guy i made up this excuse about how i worked in this certain industry that was slow in winter and busy the rest of the time so i never had a chance....and now u know y i'm here...haha i know the deal as having lurked a lil.lol    and lady luck herself    ah hell pike's open in some areas here's some pike porn.lol that saying is new to me    looking fwd to posting some softwater pics."
