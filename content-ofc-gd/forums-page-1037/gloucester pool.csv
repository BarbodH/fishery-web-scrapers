198080,irishfield,2008-05-07 18:39:00,26272,Waters high and the currents fast.
198108,Grandman,2008-05-07 19:55:00,31,Me and F7 Firecat came to the conclusion that there's no fish to be had there.  My grandfather fished there back in the 70's.  I'll look at his maps tonight and PM you some of his spots.
