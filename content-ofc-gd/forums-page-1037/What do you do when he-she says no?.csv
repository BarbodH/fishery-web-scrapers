Then there was two. The lower one I assume was the male The bird on the top doesn't move from her corner through all this ordeal.   The one that was resting quietly, turns and looks at me?  He certainly doesn't look happy. The male bird on the left moves closer. Mighty fat and chubby I'd say.   He moves closer in for a better look at her. Surely the sense of attraction is there.   He askes the ultimate question nicely. Even look's like he's smiling.    But the other partner is just not interested. And turns thier back. And Plays deaf.  The other bird screams again. Wanting to makeout badly.  Still nothing, no reaction from the other bird. She ignores and cleans herself.  This time he screams top of his little lungs. In desparation!  Got some reaction. The female turned around and was looking in the right direction now.  But that was all the reaction the bird got. This little guy was go angry his little feathers where all puffed up. Talk about desparate. Then he makes one last a temp....   Looks around... And goes right beside the female and let's it ""RIP!!""   By then it was all over She flew away and the show as over.  dsn"
