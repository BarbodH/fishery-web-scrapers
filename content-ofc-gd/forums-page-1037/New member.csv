196909,timmeh,2008-05-05 19:15:00,609,"Hello all,  My name is Tim, and I'm currently a student in Waterloo. I've always enjoyed fishing but in the last year or so I've found the time to turn this small hobby into a minor obsession. This past season I got into steelheading, and while I didn't hook that many fish I'm certainly hooked myself. But I did manage to learn a fair bit. Other that I mostly fish for bass and pike around Southern Ontario.  I look forward to learning a few things here and helping out others if I can.  Cheers, Tim"

I predict that next season you'll have plenty of trout under your wing.  Nice intro...welcome to the board...you have any pics of your catches?"

197015,timmeh,2008-05-05 22:11:00,609,"thanks for the welcome everyone,  I've had some camera problems (like my camera only working for 3 seconds then dying) so I'm lacking in good pictures at the moment, but I've got a new one so hopefully soon I'll be able to post some. I can see people enjoy pictures on this site.  Victor: I'm also at the U of Waterloo, I'm a grad student in biology, but I'm not on campus too often either."
