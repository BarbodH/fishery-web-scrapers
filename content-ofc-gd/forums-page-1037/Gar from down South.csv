197658,mattyk,2008-05-06 22:37:00,2110,Caught my first ever gar today on the ohio river while i was fishing for sauger.    I also lost count of the sauger that I caught.  
197671,Greencoachdog,2008-05-06 23:06:00,8163,"Great going Matt!!!  Those things are hard to hook with an actual hook and not a frayed piece of nylon... and believe it or not, are edible... but you dang near need a chainsaw to clean one!!!   ... btw... where's the Sauger pics???"
197686,HTHM,2008-05-06 23:41:00,4082,Well done! I hope to be able to do the same up here in Ont. That is a nice fish! WTG!
197761,smbhunter,2008-05-07 01:40:00,186,Great job. That's a good size gar.
197763,irishfield,2008-05-07 01:43:00,26272,Great stuff Matt ! Good to see a fishing report from you!
197764,GbayGiant,2008-05-07 01:44:00,1780,"Nice, not a bad size either. I've only caught 2 smaller then that one in my life both with a 1/16th ounce jig and worm fishing walleye on Gbay."
