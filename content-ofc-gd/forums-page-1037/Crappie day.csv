196181,ehg,2008-05-04 04:41:00,2666,"Went to the Kawarthas with Mikeh on Saturday to try for crappies. Ended up catching hundreds of bluegill and crappie on micro tube/float setup. There were downpours some of the day but we stuck it out. Here is some pictures.  Some crappie    Caught some sunfish as well    Put the white bucket to use  a look inside bucket   Had a great day and kept some fish for consumption. It was pretty good despite the rain.  Got a fish for tourney. Even though we caught well over a hundred fish each I kept what looked like 11-12 inch ones but won't do that again however, since it was to much work once i got home.   cheers, ehg"

196225,mattyk,2008-05-04 11:22:00,2110,thanks for sharing.
196230,Chris,2008-05-04 11:46:00,405,"Hey ehg....nice catch....I see the dude in the photo got the ""Lew"" smile thing down pat haha."
196235,lew,2008-05-04 11:56:00,12767,"Nice feed of fish ya got there ehg, congrats on a good day !!   Always good to see folks having fun on the water Chris"
196243,Greencoachdog,2008-05-04 12:15:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  What was the water clarity/visibility and surface temp?
196247,Smokey,2008-05-04 12:24:00,1278,Great looking bunch of fish. Congrats and enjoy the meal.
196257,lunkerbasshunter,2008-05-04 12:44:00,2585,looks yummy!
196293,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-04 15:01:00,0,Nice! Sounds like the action was fast and furious! Those are some pretty nice sized crappies! Enjoy!
196309,mikeh,2008-05-04 15:40:00,824,"The action was non stop once we found them, the first bay we went into there was nothing except for an oos musky that liked my little jig(broke off), the second bay we went into is where we found lots of crappie and bluegill . We fished 1 1/2 foot to 3 feet of water , the fish bite did not stop when it rained either, and it rained/drizzled for about 4 hours. I'm going outside now to take the cover off the boat to dry it out. I enjoyed fishing with you  again  EHG, we'll have to get together  when musky season opens."
196365,irishfield,2008-05-04 17:25:00,26272,"Great stuff Erik !! Lots of work filleting them up... why I love my deer hunter dropping them off prepared at my back door, as payment to hunt my property! UMMMY stuff !"
196473,tbayboy,2008-05-04 23:20:00,1497,"Great stuff guys, nothing makes fishing in the rain more bearable  than non stop fish."
196572,ehg,2008-05-05 02:07:00,2666,"Thanks for replies people,  Mikeh, don't forget the 6-7 OOS largemouth had a liking for the micro jig/float as well as that muskie.  Yup, rain or shine or whatever if i plan to go fishing only life threatening conditions will stop that. The non stop action was a treat, but if you had to eat or drink or whatever the fishing had to stop, since the float would immediately go under.  Took three hours to fillet those critters. "
196727,snag,2008-05-05 13:24:00,1932, Now THAT'S IMPRESSIVE!
197106,ehg,2008-05-06 00:05:00,2666,"Took around three hours for the boneless fillets, the next morning it took about half an hour to skin them all. Weighed the fillets at 8.5 lbs for total. Not bad considering i planned to keep none, until i saw the white bucket in mike's truck before we went on lake.  This is the only crappie report i see from the weekend, that's surprising!  ehg"
197128,Beans,2008-05-06 00:23:00,3339,  That'll teach you to keep less next time...  My bro-in-law had the same complaint opening weekend...he only kept three for cleaning today...  Maybe the Kawarthas need a limit of 30 crappies...Like lake Simcoe...
197449,wallyboss,2008-05-06 14:40:00,1095,"You need to get yourself an electric fillet knife, it sure cuts down on the filleting time."
197473,ehg,2008-05-06 15:41:00,2666," Thanks for the tip on electric knife , was thinking about that.  However like to feel the tip of fillet knife to go around rib cage. The time to do this included cleaning of sink, utensils and boards and put out garbage. I work as a chef for living so these things happen fast and effeciently. It was around 35 fish to clean.  cheers,  ehg"
197557,nelly,2008-05-06 19:36:00,256,"Nice catch of slabs there ehg. Hoping to get out this weekend but it will be a 50/50 chance. Mother Day this weekend and busy for the next 2-3 weekends. Fencing to install and wedding to go. Beans, thanks for the reminder about the 30 crappie on Simcoe but if I head out, it will be in the Kawartha."
