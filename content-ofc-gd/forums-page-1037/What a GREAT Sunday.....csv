After a bunch of us got Big Cliff's dock in place, my little one couldn't wait to get out there to brave the wind and cold to catch a few from there.  Her line was in the water for mere seconds when she landed her first rock bass of the year...she was excited to catch this one!!   A few more came in as well....one perch was a pretty decent size too!     We left Big Cliff's and started to head home...but Sydney wanted to catch some more fish so we headed for her favourite shore spot on Lake Scugog.  Here she learned how to lip a fish...in preparation for some largies or smallies later this summer....and she was fascinated with releasing them as well...     After we got home, Bly and I decided to head out to see if the carp were swimming around...and we were not disappointed!  I got a little one (in comparison to Blys!!).  It came in at 31""...and is my first entry for the tourney!  I forgot my team sign, so we had to write this one up quickly!   Bly, not to be outdone, went and landed her PB carp...and monster at 37.5"" and 25 pounds.  This one took a while to get in...it stayed deep all the way in and really tested her skills...especially since it was pitch dark out....anyways...here's the monster!   All in all, we had a GREAT Sunday....hope the weather holds up....would love to get the boat out next weekend."
