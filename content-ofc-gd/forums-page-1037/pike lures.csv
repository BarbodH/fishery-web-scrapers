196426,SBCregal,2008-05-04 20:07:00,688,"hey gang  I'm looking to get out for some pike soon, and have a trip to the 1000 islands area (out of Gananoque) planned for June so I've been gathering some gear to target pike.  I alread have some x-raps and williams spoons and I just grabbed some more gear (pic attached).  I was wondering if you guys have any other recommendations on gear to grab.  Lure recommendations and also... probably more importantly, landing and handling equipment.  this is some of the stuff I just bought  the gear i just bought  thanks alot  ryan"
196429,johnnyb,2008-05-04 20:28:00,3413,"I am by no means experienced on the St.Lawrence, and I'm sure there are some on here who will point out a couple lures you shouldn't be without...if I were headed out there I'd have a couple deep divers -- whether they be Tail Dancers, or deep diving X-raps, or whatever...something with a bigger lip that will crack the 15' mark in case the pike are hanging out down there. And Mepps just came out with a heavier Aglia #5...I think it's called the Aglia Long...it has a smooth body instead of the beaded aglia, and weighs 7/8 oz.  Nice and heavy for longer casts and deeper retrieves. Best of luck!!"
196430,Roy,2008-05-04 20:32:00,13728,"Good stuff Ryan but if you feel like getting a couple more items, get these. Toronto Wobblers"
196443,musky66,2008-05-04 21:55:00,273,"I wouldn't use the Red Wolf products myself- poor quality in my opinion. A couple of real 'devles would be better. I wouldn't go for Pike now without a couple of Rapala X raps, a white spinner bait and a sluggo or something similiar to dead bait."
196445,Gerritt,2008-05-04 22:05:00,6129,My bet is that HJ-14 is going to be the most productive lure you have in your arsenal.. I would perhaps add an HJ12 in the same colour...  G
196447,BillM,2008-05-04 22:10:00,17367,Some Husky Jerks and some spinnerbaits should work fine.  Some suspending X-Raps are also a fav of mine.
196449,addict,2008-05-04 22:12:00,475,cant go wrong with the xraps used them last yr on the annual far north pike and they rock gators cant resist .cotton cordell riplin redfin is also deadly.
196451,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-04 22:14:00,241,Have you tried marshmallows?!
196456,Woodsman,2008-05-04 22:31:00,1286,"A large perch coloured believer. 6""-10"" in length. Also try some larger sized baits than you already have. Bigger spoons & spinners."
196469,mistaredone,2008-05-04 23:14:00,913,Dont forget big long nose plyers and jaw spreaders.  As for lures mepps 3 long in perch colours for working outside weed lines and any spinners for inside.
196475,Greencoachdog,2008-05-04 23:22:00,8163,I really like these for Pike! 
196479,Rich,2008-05-04 23:37:00,3927,Where's the spinnerbaits?
196480,jediangler,2008-05-04 23:38:00,1923,Mmmm...Slopmaster
196955,SBCregal,2008-05-05 20:40:00,688,"nice, thanks for all the replies  looks like i'll be heading out for some white spinnerbaits and some landing/handling stuff. i do have 30lb, 12"" wire leaders, will these be heavy enough, or should i move to some heavier wire, or some fluoro leaders?  we'll be on the houseboat the 3rd week of june (leaving the area on the bass opener...next yr the ladies wont be setting the dates) hope we can get into some fish!  thanks again ryan"
197002,addict,2008-05-05 21:58:00,475,"heres another tip tie all your landing gear,pliers, jaw spreaders to the boat pike have a tendency to go for round 2 once u try to unhook them lost a few sets of pliers and spreaders due to thrashing.if your like me and dont use nets watch your fingers on the gill rakers.this year we are bringing a cradle with us on our trip to use on the big girls.good luck hope ya get slimed."
197011,cranks bait,2008-05-05 22:10:00,721,"Get any closer and you will be knocking on my door.    First off, there are no pkie in the Larry, I proved that last night in the wind storm.  Here's what does work in these waters.  An HJ14 Rapala Husky Jerk (5.5 inches), in Tenn. shad.  A Reef Runner deep diver in white.  White spinners, along with black and red hair jigs.   These have been my best productive lures so far.  I wash many, but these are what produce.  Good luck, and have fun."
197013,Musky or Specks,2008-05-05 22:11:00,2710,Im also a huge fan of white porko's if the fishing gets tuff.
197014,Smokey,2008-05-05 22:11:00,1278,Another great one is the Johnson Silver minnow. It's a great almost weedless pike lure.
197076,mepps,2008-05-05 23:24:00,1301,Looks like you have a great selection already!  you just need one of these  
197321,SBCregal,2008-05-06 03:47:00,688,i'm guess that's a mepps (not Mepps) made lure? do you make and sell those ?
197348,goober,2008-05-06 09:24:00,14,husky jerk clown pattern........they love it!!!
