I have caught 2 big walleye there (both around 10 pounds) but both were by accident.  I caught one trolling for lakers and the other jigging for bass. My question is this.  Without giving out exact locations, where can I actually find walleye in Simcoe?  I have an old map with fish locations and on it the largest area containing walleye seems to be in cooks bay.  Is this where I should go to look for them?  If so what depth and I looking for 15-30ft? thanks."

197734,Terry,2008-05-07 00:58:00,14456,one of life's sweet mysteries ..   be interesting to read the replies
197735,Cudz,2008-05-07 01:01:00,2652,Ok i thought as much.  I probably won't wste my time.  I went out on the lake from 830 until 1030 for some night perch but got nothing.  Go figure.  I never have good luck with perch at night.  Bass at night is good but no perch.  Any reaon for this?  I was marking fish between 22 and 27ft though.
197736,MuddyWater,2008-05-07 01:02:00,218,beaverton is your best bet. i could tell you when where and what to use but then i would have to kill you. best bet is to go on a hunt for them. never caught a small one their always quite large use your moons and find baitfish is a good way.
197741,Cudz,2008-05-07 01:07:00,2652,"Ok that is a start.  I have a friend with a cottage in Beaverton so I will give it a try (if I am not smallmouth fishing by then).  I don't need help with lures, just location.  Thnaks. Steve, We have a mutual friend in Joe Lauzon. lol.  I love mma."
197915,ehg,2008-05-07 13:07:00,2666,"I read an article back about 20 yrs. ago suggesting trolling rapala J13's,F13's or F18's off the mouth of the Talbot R. at opening season, as the best chance at a big walleye.  You need to find a weedline or depth contour to troll along.  Good luck"
