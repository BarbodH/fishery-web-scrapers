197597,xrap,2008-05-06 20:25:00,683,"Well I went fishing this Sunday, and as we get the spot. Were walking down the hill to the river and see two guys that are making thier way back up. I asked them how the fishing was and the one guy said nothing and the other guy ya we got some, and then the first guy who first blurted ""nothing"" then answered back yea a little... And then they just walked away. It seemed kinda strange too me why he would lie but when we got to the river I knew why.    Bunch of catfish and sucker heads....    Here's the guts and eggs......    They made a big mess which kinda got me mad but when I looked closely inside the pile of heads THis is what really got me mad    Pike is closed in this section for another week, I just hope those eggs didn't come from the pike."
197599,Zubris21,2008-05-06 20:27:00,563,That is pretty gross.  The least they could have done is through the guts back in the water to fatten up some carp/catfish for next time.   The pike is inexcusable.
197603,fishinggeek,2008-05-06 20:32:00,325,"Isn't throwing the guts back in the water another offence?  That is quite the bloodbath there.  I wonder if poaching is getting worse or better.  On the one hand, I can't remember conservation being more widely accepted.  On the other, people on here have loads of these kinds of reports.  I'm hoping it's gotten better, but we're hearing about it more because of the Internet."
197604,xrap,2008-05-06 20:33:00,683,Thier was more all over the place I jsut didn't take pics of all of it.
197605,Zubris21,2008-05-06 20:34:00,563,"  Yes I believe it is, but I'd rather see a fat carp or catfish than another fat Raccoon."
197609,Photoz,2008-05-06 20:43:00,792,"They shoulda tossed the stuff in the water . . .    makes good feed for mink, sea gulls, turtles & other scavengers. That'll likely be all gone in a few days. HOWEVER . . . .     the O. O. S. pike head doesn't impress me much at all . . .   unfortunately there are a lot of people around who are getting to know watta joke patroling our waterways is . . . .    when the Ministry won't even allot enough gas for C. O's to do their jobs, nor do the have anywhere near enough bodies to do the job. Makes me S-I-C-K!! (Unfortunately carp don't eat that stuff!)"
197612,xrap,2008-05-06 20:47:00,683,I got my lisence checked this year while fishing for catfish at 1am by 2 o.p.p officers   Maybe thier will be more o.p.p  doing lisence check's this year.
197618,Golfisher,2008-05-06 21:01:00,586,"So, is there any reason why one would resort to butchering catfish and suckers on the spot?  For making fresh sashimi to go?"
197623,maybe,2008-05-06 21:21:00,307,Good camo for the pike head.  How many people are going to look layers down in a pile of carnage like that?
197647,Garry2Rs,2008-05-06 22:10:00,1425,"I don't understand how people can leave the city, to enjoy nature, then proceed to disrespect it so. How can anyone walk away from a mess like that? There are bottles, cans, and styrofoam worm containers up and down the shoreline at every public access point in the Kawarthas... I live on Hwy 28, at least 40 or 50 Km from the closest Timmie's or McDonald's, and almost every Monday I get to pick-up Tim Horton and McD's litter out of my ditch.  For F**ks sake keep the trash in your vehicle until you stop for gas etc. and if your throwing beer bottles, toss them lightly so they don't break, I can't get a dime for the broken ones...hahaha."
197648,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-06 22:16:00,3761,"Nobody in the right mind would keep the dead fish ther, put em in a bag and chusk em in a garbadge....as for the pike their just plain stupid."
197810,xrap,2008-05-07 03:05:00,683," I'm glad I didn't get a pick of the garbage, hmm makes me think back to why I stopepd fishing this place"
197814,solopaddler,2008-05-07 03:13:00,8605," I was thinking the same thing myself...yech!  And yeah, yeah I know catfish are delicious  . Still wouldn't catch me eating those things  ."
197816,Live2Fish83,2008-05-07 03:14:00,26,I am also very dissappointed:( i have no respect for ppl who butcher fish and  are meat hunters!! then ppl wonder y popular fishing spots are made private...and the garbage is getting worse year to year....how are ppl supposed to enjoy nature or even going fishing with loads of garbage around? good report x-rap glad you decided to report this!
197962,Zubris21,2008-05-07 15:02:00,563, Carp wont even eat the guts?  I figured they would at least suck up some of that stuff if they found it on bottom.
