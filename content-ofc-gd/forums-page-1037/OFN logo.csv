197724,ketchenany,2008-05-07 00:41:00,3229,".TJ would it be a problem if I got my own shirt made?  I'm in advertising  and know logo regulations. . . In order for you to reproduce the logo you need the owner's release AND his electronic file  (Illustrator) if it's registered. (BTW it's done illegal everyday, same as poaching) Legally  you cannot go to a place that photocopies it and puts it on a shirt . . .  You know those GUCCI bags that are at the flea markets LOL.  Support the ""boss"" and he may give you a ""secret"" fishing spot in return . . . as JW always said ""that will be the day"""
197744,irishfield,2008-05-07 01:14:00,26272,There is nothing needing changing. Ontario Fishing Network is still alive and well..... This is OFC !
197771,chickenhawk,2008-05-07 02:00:00,612, ummmm....obviously you didn't understand....nothing I said in this post suggested that anything was wrong with OFC....
197773,irishfield,2008-05-07 02:04:00,26272,"What I'm trying to tell you chickenhawk is ""Roy and the Mods"" have nothing to do with TJ's OFC business. This is OFC... thus nothing needs changing with TJ's clothing line. If they want something seperate for OFC then that's a whole different ball game."
197776,TJQ,2008-05-07 02:05:00,7806,"No worries ch, maybe ill do up a colectors edition with a pickeral alongside my logo, so everyone will know what a pickeral looks like!!"
197777,bigfish1965,2008-05-07 02:05:00,3382,"I have an idea, but it would require pre-ordering to get it done.............."
197785,chickenhawk,2008-05-07 02:14:00,612, i apologize.....and i apologize to TJ....i honestly didnt mean any disrespect....
197053,Meely,2008-05-05 22:58:00,282,"Ok......hows'bout this........  OFC's very own.........thongs........  Of course each participant in the board tourney would have to verify they were wearing theirs in all their pics posted in order to make the catch ""official""!!!  I'm thinking of something simple embroidered on the front like.........  Ontario Fishing. Net  ""Home of the Canadian Wiggler""  What do you guys think ??  Perhaps someone nifty with all this computer stuff can fire up a sample.  If we act quick, maybe TJ can model it for the OFC'ers at this years Lake Air trip ??  Meely"
197058,danbouck,2008-05-05 23:07:00,4380, Great.. Now I have pepsi all over my monitor
197222,chickenhawk,2008-05-06 01:45:00,612, well maybe we can keep the current logo....and add something to it? man its just a suggestion.....i knew it would bother some of the guys who have been here alot longer....but as i can remember i was part of the old site.....then lost interest for a while...then signed back up on the new site....it is still the same logo.....im jus saying maybe we can jus make some really cool gear.....we don't have to change the logo to make something look cool....just spice it up a bit....
197263,danbo,2008-05-06 02:10:00,2646,"Atta boy,Hawk!     I agree!!"
197278,Greencoachdog,2008-05-06 02:26:00,8163,How about if we put a regular ol' OFC t-shirt (2 sizes too small) and cap on one of the Hooters Girls???   That would be a nice change!!!
197279,muskymike,2008-05-06 02:27:00,772,"I see your perspective hawk, but i have to lean the other way. i havnt been a member on here for too long, but i respect what they have and believe it TJ wants to change it he will. Ultimately its his decision as ""WE"" dont pay for anything (umm unless you buy something haha)  I like the logo....simple yet shows what it needs to and promotes.  Good on ya TJ!  Hawk draft something up and post it, i know you said you are not that good on ps but give it a shot. its very simple actually.....even if it never makes way, you still put forth the effort and learned something along the way."
197295,danbo,2008-05-06 02:53:00,2646,"Yes it's very expensive to change it all. .      Thanx TJ, for this great place to play!"
197399,Stoty,2008-05-06 12:28:00,2910,  Well which is it Danbo? Seems to me your a little confused unless you're posting random pictures.
197417,TJQ,2008-05-06 13:38:00,7806,"Hey... I can appreciate the yearning for a new logo.. and its ok to want one, no hard feelings here... this is the way Ill explain things..  My OFC apparel is sold pretty much at my cost, as a promotional vehicle for MY website(s)  the ones I make my living from.  Apparel is a pain i the ass, you have to get it done, you have to inventory it and you have to pay for it all, in all sizes, in the hopes that the users buy it.  I've done stuff like this twice before, where it took me a long time to get inventory.  Its difficult to get someone to embroider one piece at a time...  I still have boat flags here that should have all been sold two years ago.... and I did a bunch of apparel for women that took a long time to sell.  and once again, theres no real money in apparel. it doesn't fly out the door and its at my cost.  When we went to this new board format we decided that since I already inventory, I had an embroiderer, and a logo that was branded and recognizable that we would keep my stuff for the apparel.  This may change in the future however, but for now this is the way it is..."
197419,Greencoachdog,2008-05-06 13:42:00,8163,  So is this a yes or a no to a Hooters Girl wearing an OFC t-shirt?
197420,Stoty,2008-05-06 13:42:00,2910,"Great points TJ.  I agree that nothing needs to be done with the logo. Like it was said, its your trademark and people recognize it. Reminds me of that old saying ""Dont fix something that isnt broken""."
197424,TJQ,2008-05-06 13:52:00,7806, Ill get right on it!!!!!
197425,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-06 13:55:00,2050, 
197430,Stoty,2008-05-06 14:01:00,2910,"LOL  I dated a Hooters girl, and wow, I would be surprised if she knew which way to put the shirt on! Taking it off...well she seemed accustomed to that!"
197441,ketchenany,2008-05-06 14:24:00,3229,I'm  in advertising and it's all about building a 'brand' that people will recognize and this takes time eventally a logo will be your signature changing it only confuses  the issue. Here are logos that have stood the test of time.  Rolls Royce 1904  Greyhound 1926  Levi Strauss 1880s  CN 1960  Ford 1903  Esso 1920  Mercedes Benz 1909  Coke -Cola 1887  Shell 1904 1961 1999  and the number one logo  The Michelin Man 1898  OFC
197456,lew,2008-05-06 15:03:00,12767,"Some of us have been wearing that old OFC logo for quite a few years now, no sense in changing a good thing just for the sake of change."
197460,Roy,2008-05-06 15:09:00,13728,It IS recognizable. Ask anyone in the fishing industry.
197514,LeXXington,2008-05-06 17:49:00,1928,"Please don't change the logo.. I would hate to start buying it all over again  The OFC store is great, not sure who is the main driving force behind shipping but its fast and always packed nicely"
197629,chickenhawk,2008-05-06 21:30:00,612,Well......it is clear that everyone is happy with the current logo....I apologize for suggesting otherwise....
197637,danbouck,2008-05-06 21:47:00,4380,I don't think you need to apologize!
197662,chickenhawk,2008-05-06 22:40:00,612,jus tryin to be a nice guy is all...lol
197663,ccmtcanada,2008-05-06 22:43:00,7971, That would be Monique...TJ really has no idea what's going on.....LOL
197712,chickenhawk,2008-05-07 00:13:00,612, I never said anything about it not being recognizable....in fact I am proud to be a member and would show it off if it was new or old....I was just suggesting maybe some cool things to add to it....maybe for some t-shirts or hoodies or something....but as TJ stated it seems to be expensive and a pain in the arse for him....so I will just leave it at that.....TJ would it be a problem if I got my own shirt made?
197717,Gerritt,2008-05-07 00:21:00,6129,  TJ... get out the lancets.. we have another one wanting to sign in blood on the dotted line...
197720,chickenhawk,2008-05-07 00:29:00,612,if thats the case then give me a pin to prick myself with...lol no problems signing my name in blood hahaha
196884,chickenhawk,2008-05-05 18:41:00,612,"Now don't anybody take this personal or anything....but I was just checking out some of the clothing and accessories and I just found it to be very plain and simple.....nothing that really made me go wow I really want that.....so what would you think....TJ, Roy and the rest of the MODS of maybe doing a contest or something to possibly figure out a new logo/design for some of the clothing.....I just know that there are some people on this board who are excellent with photoshop and I am sure could make a really cool logo.....it's up to you guys, I am happy either way, just putting it out there....anybody else agree?"
196901,chickenhawk,2008-05-05 19:02:00,612,guess not eh? lol
196902,Marko,2008-05-05 19:04:00,854,you`ve done it now lol

196908,huntervasili,2008-05-05 19:14:00,1604," I'll one up ya, how about the background being in front of sobeys, ohh and will the boat be a tiller or console btw?"
196914,danbouck,2008-05-05 19:20:00,4380,Don't forget to add a net in the backround!

197000,chickenhawk,2008-05-05 21:51:00,612,thats pretty cool danbo....see if you could get something more real life liek maybe a walleye being reeled that gets nailed by a big pike or something with OFNcommunity.com i think that would be killer
197021,TJQ,2008-05-05 22:22:00,7806,"The OFC logo is my own, that I have been branding for over 10 years now,  weve talked about having stuff done for the OFC but its not something were looking into right now.  Its alot to get it all done and pay for it... Ive had some experiences with the OFC merch that i had custom done and still have inventory, after a couple of years.  That being said, I did just get some pocket knives done, lol.. ill have pictures shorlty...."

197031,bpsbassman,2008-05-05 22:29:00,941,"I recognize TJ and Roy in that shot, but who's the third guy??"
197035,brickNblock,2008-05-05 22:38:00,598,"Wellllllllll....chickenhawk... I kinda like the stuff the way it is right now. It doesnt smack ya in the face like it belongs on the FLW tour nor in NASCAR. Dont get me wrong...I love both the above mentioned but, I think the OFC merch., is sorta laid back and a great representation of the true outdoorsman in the colours that are already there..(we all got our likes/dislikes) Ive personally got quite a bit of OFC merch., and I like it.... The bright yellow jacket with the logo and your board name kinda scared me at first(very bright), but Ive grown to be proud to have one and will wear it whenever on the boat when it calls for it. Personally..I think we'd be much like everyone else ifn we made it too splashy and we'd end up losing the laid back but serious look. Nothing impressed me more then seeing ...'DipLips'..yellar jacket one year at Lakair..seen him and Raf come up from the water after a serius days fishing... ...worn in...slimed and bloodied with countless hook removal holes.........Serious stuff. Dont change a thing TJ."
