197465,lew,2008-05-06 15:24:00,12767,Great stuff Mike and good to see you boyz got into some nice fish on the Bay.  See you in 10 1/2 days.....but who's counting
197467,ccmtcanada,2008-05-06 15:31:00,7971," Hey...I told the fish to hold it, but it wasn't cooperating...."
197649,Mike the Pike,2008-05-06 22:21:00,3421, Had I held my sign like that Sunday Cliff the 1/4 inch foam core would have ripped my teeth out because of the high winds.I will however try that on the next fish wind conditions permitting.Slimy fish and slimy sign from slimy saliva Cliff
197682,mepps,2008-05-06 23:34:00,1301,awesome stuff!
196708,Mike the Pike,2008-05-05 12:41:00,3421,"Well it felt good to be back on the Bay of Quinte eventhough the weather was nasty.Most of the weekend we had high winds and off and on Rain was a little chilly but we all dressed for the occasion.  I went with friends Dave,Danny and my boat pilot Kenny and we fished out of his side console boat.  Saturday Morning we got on the water and it raining which won't stop us especially since we were in the Kiwanis fishing Tournament.  Dave was with Danny in the Princecraft boat and Dave managed to hook into an 8.98 lbs walleye which was weighed in Picton Harbour.  Now these old guys   Danny has a brand new camera and he didn't take a picture of Dave's new PB  Did meet up with Superdad who weighed in a 11.2 pounder in Picton Harbour.  Well enough with the bordom here are the pics.   Ken's first walleye 4 pounds even.   This one was 6lbs 4oz.A new PB for Kenny   A shot from Green point.   My boat pilot.   The other 2 guys who were roughing it.Must be nice!     Finally it was my turn on Day 2 a 21 incher for the team.Team #6 The Reel Screamers.   I could barely hold this sign made of foam core in the high winds believe me it was rough out there.   Rougher than it looks.     Bayside Cottages.     Yes GCD I was driving a side console boat and I found it tough to control the boat with the wheel. I love my Tiller.     Results top ten Walleye Kiwanis tournament.   Results top ten Pike.   Junior participants results.   Release Tank.   Top Walleye prize a Lund 1425 Classic with 25hp Honda.   Top Pike prize a Lund WC 14 with a 15hp Honda.   This car was flipped on the way home in Brockville. It seems people are not getting the message the 401 seems like a race track the newer stiifer fines seem to have no effect.  Oh and the OPP stopped us on the water for an inspection which we passed they also checked fishing permits and the livewell.They are doing a good job.  Well hope you enjoyed my report despite tough conditions we did boat some nice fish and we did get some OOS bass too.  2 more weeks and I will be back in Quinte for the long weekend.  Mike the pike"
196711,ccmtcanada,2008-05-05 12:48:00,7971,Great report Mike!  Looked pretty rough out there....a little reminiscent of the G2G back in November!  Congrats on your tourney entry as well....although I'm sure you'll be beating that size many times over before the end of the year.
196713,largemouth,2008-05-05 13:01:00,112,nice report. Did you snag up with another boat and lose a smithwick rouge in haybay by chance?
196738,mattyk,2008-05-05 13:35:00,2110,thanks for the great report.
196742,danbouck,2008-05-05 13:47:00,4380,Great Report! That weather looks nasty
196751,irishfield,2008-05-05 14:03:00,26272,Nice report Mike !!  Oh.. and BTW.. your fish doesn't count.. can't read that little sign with your hand in the way!
196753,johnnyb,2008-05-05 14:05:00,3413,"Excellent report -- some big pike too, by the looks of that board.  Thanks for sharing!"
196777,tbayboy,2008-05-05 14:57:00,1497,"Great stuff Mike, way to weather the big water -  We stayed to the smaller water and even that was pretty nuts on Sunday (I've still got the sea legs going here at my desk).  You guys got into some nice sizes there but that 20lb pike that went up day one - pretty much new that one would run away with it.  With 4lb difference over second, must have been one happy camper when that got pulled in."
196801,Zubris21,2008-05-05 16:00:00,563,"Great report, is that FF in the background of the first pic?  if so I'm heading there this coming weekend, and hope to have some of the same success."
196805,wgk36,2008-05-05 16:20:00,69,"Great report Mike, it has me itching for Vicortia Day weekend in Quinte."
196821,bpsbassman,2008-05-05 16:57:00,941,Thanks Mike. Great report!
196827,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-05 17:12:00,0,"Excellent report! Other than the bad weather, looks like you guys did well. A 20lb pike? I wonder where that was caught??Probably trolling deep for pickeral."
196855,solopaddler,2008-05-05 18:12:00,8605,"Nice report Mike, I'm guessing the fishing will be even better when you head back."
196861,huntervasili,2008-05-05 18:17:00,1604,Nice going Mike... Glad ya got fish other than pike... That fish doesn't count though... all I see is www.ofnccity.com with some fingers mixed in   and yup you know the waves are big when the horizon shifts and the land gets tilted by 10 degrees lol. Glad you enjoyed yourself anyway
197018,superdad,2008-05-05 22:14:00,353,"Mike,  It was nice to say hi, even though we were bobbing up and down on the water.  You guys did well.  The weather sucked on Sunday, so we left at 0930.  Thanks for the picture of the winning weights and the names, the results posted other places were quite wrong. I will use your photo to show the results.  I'm sure you'll be back this summer, perhaps we can get together.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"

197130,Mike the Pike,2008-05-06 00:24:00,3421, I was holding onto that sign for dear life Wayne that and trying to keep my balance was enough .  Not sure how many KPH the wind was blowin but it was worse than the November G2G.  If my had of been paper it would have ripped out of my Hand.I know I need to learn how to hold Pike and tourney signs.
