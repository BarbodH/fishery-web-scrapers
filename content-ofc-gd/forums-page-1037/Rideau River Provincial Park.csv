Has any one camped At Rideau River campsite .How is this place  I noticed Rideau River has lots of available space I wonder why.  Wanted to go to Charleston lake but not much availability.  Looking for something within 300kms or less of Montreal.  Mike

Suggest pulling out each night and putting boat on campsite... probably have to anyhow. Good weedbed on far side of channel. Hammer handles and bass is what we came up with but didn't work too hard. Should be able to find some pickeral up at the lock overflow and muskie in them weeds.
