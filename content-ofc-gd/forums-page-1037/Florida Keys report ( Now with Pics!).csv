196567,oxcowboy,2008-05-05 02:00:00,544,"man what a time it must have been. thank you for sharing your adventure, im sure you got more than just me thinking that it would be one hell of a trip.  jason"
196584,scuro,2008-05-05 02:30:00,386," What a great story! I'm smiling now as I re-imagine it!  Holding up those huge reels...the only thing I can relate it to would be Sturgeon fishing in BC. Were there any long drawn out battles where they fought like bulldogs...was it a totally exhausting fish?...or was it simply repeated bursts of super activity and acrobatics, followed by an easy reel of a spent fish? Lots and lots of frayed 100 pound fluro, I can't even picture it...even the size of these fish are mind boggling...."
196592,joco,2008-05-05 03:12:00,57,crazzyhook...............  that an hell off a great report bud..  nice to see you got some great action down there and some paddling in the oceans yaaaaaaa  you up for some paddling this friday..?  thanks for sharing those picts and report.  joco
197146,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 00:32:00,1154,"Dude I have to work on Friday... trying to figure out what my new ride is going to be this year.. we will get out soon bud!  Scuro... fights were nuts. Long runs, jumps and when you think they are done they breath air and it starts all over again. 4 fights went over half an hour... one fish jumped 10 times and another one almost had 300 yards out..."
197179,Rustic-Fisher,2008-05-06 01:08:00,826,I NEED TO DO THIS!!!! That is a great report!!!  RF
197196,Mike the Pike,2008-05-06 01:23:00,3421,Love the shot of you with the snapper and the cigar.  Did you wash the bait cooler with your underwear  Excellent report Jamie
197258,scuro,2008-05-06 02:08:00,386,Can't wait to see the rest of the pics.
197285,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 02:37:00,1154,Put up the big bull....  man the boys are slow with pics!
197297,MJL,2008-05-06 02:54:00,2427,Unreal! The reels you used are massive.  Kinda makes you think twice before skinny dipping with cudas and sharks swimming about.  That's one trip I wanna do before I die  Great report CH...Love the pics
197301,bpsbassman,2008-05-06 02:58:00,941,WOW!! What a great trip Jamie! Thanks for the great report.  Looking forward to the rest of the pics.
197344,lew,2008-05-06 08:58:00,12767," Jamie, every report I ever read about huge tarpon talks about them wearing thru the fluoro with their rough mouths, so is there any reason nobody ever seems to use wire leaders ??  I also watch that Pro Tarpon show on the tube the odd time and they lose quite a few in the same way it seems"
197368,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 11:21:00,1154,"  Lew, I tried with wire and the answer is simple, they don't eat. The thinner the leader the more bites you get and the more break offs as well.... I kept the leader of the big boy and its frayed all the way up. Their mouths are rock hard and the line rubbing on the side of the fluro really wears it down...  One special fish!  Have to say, I have been home 3 days I am still one hurting unit"
197371,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-06 11:31:00,1362,Looks like ya had a blast Jamie....  lookin forward to seeing the rest of the pics!
197372,lew,2008-05-06 11:32:00,12767,"Thanks Jamie, that's interesting, I wouldn't have thought a fish as big & aggressive as a 100+ pound tarpon would be leader shy."
197381,Basskicker,2008-05-06 11:58:00,421,That's looks like an amazing trip.....awesome BIG fish.   Congrats  Jason
197657,NAC,2008-05-06 22:37:00,369,great stuff Crazyhook!  did ya land anything in the kayak?
197702,Jigger,2008-05-07 00:01:00,1237,"Great report, Hook! If I wasn't sold before, I'm sold now! Sounds like an awesome time. Really looking forward to the rest of the pics. Congrats on the PB!"
196123,Crazyhook,2008-05-04 02:18:00,1154,"well I got about as much sleep last night as I did in the last week. It was hot and so was the fishing.  Shark prep   The Keys were insane! I went 2 for 9 on the tarpon, fish went 80 and 120. I blew up two reels ( one spinner shark, one poon)...   Had a bull shark follow and eat my bait while out in rough seas in a kayak   ( washing underwear currently)...  bull sharks, cudas, snapper, sting rays , one big ass spotted eagle ray, spinner sharks, nurse sharks, goliath grouper were all caught, fish lost are too numerous to mention. Hooked a nice snook on a fly I tied but lost it in the mangroves.  14 hours sleep all week and two nights I slept on the bridge using my tackle box for a pillow  Here are some of the pics, we had 4 digi cameras and here are the ones that I took. 3 more rounds of shots to come... tarpon were really hard to photograph, when they were not in the air they were running. The 120 pounder took an hour to land while chasing it over a mile with the boat.  First fish of the trip, a nice mangrove snapper , part of our 4 am fish fry ( the neighboors loved us!)   key deer were all over the place and would run over the bridge while we were fishing at night  a little bait for the toothy ones  little spinner shark   Paul fighting a big tarpon   Steve hooked up to a Huge tarpon  half an hour later, tarpon frays 100 pound fluro leader. Tarpon wins...   battling my 80 pounder which was the first one I have ever caught, great half hour fight  same fish jumping   kayaking the canals in search for snook and baby poons  out looking for cuda  our bait cooler   local watering hole covered in 1 dollar bills  Paul's 250 pound 8 foot bull Shark caught from the bridge "

196286,shane,2008-05-04 14:33:00,652,Tarpon?   They're like big carp aren't they?  This should be good.
196355,misfish,2008-05-04 17:07:00,29133,"Stilllllllll waitinggggggggggggg for them pic,s."
196362,irishfield,2008-05-04 17:18:00,26272,Jamie's still busy explaining to his wife where he's been for a week Brian !
196396,mepps,2008-05-04 18:28:00,1301,NICE! Cant wait to see the photos bro!
196397,Crazyhook,2008-05-04 18:31:00,1154,"it was rough out in the big water,,, had a bull shark eat half my 10"" swimming Joe... that was the end of the paddling for me out there...   poon at the pier "
196399,irishfield,2008-05-04 18:34:00,26272,Now tell me Jamie... what the hell do you do with the fish.. fishing from the bridge. Cut it off when you get it close?
196402,Crazyhook,2008-05-04 18:36:00,1154,you can walk then down for a pic... but our problem was they were all way too big and they had thier way with us...
196406,mepps,2008-05-04 18:46:00,1301,  Had their way with you indeed!  Those tarpon are tough to handle! Took me a while before I was able to get a solid picture with one!
196411,Greencoachdog,2008-05-04 19:04:00,8163, Sounds like some of the women down here...
196448,mattyk,2008-05-04 22:11:00,2110,"cool pics. Sounds like a great trip, thanks for sharing Jamie!"
196542,scuro,2008-05-05 01:26:00,386,"I'm looking for a little more detail. I'm sure there were some good stories. 80 pound Poon...Most people have never even battled a fish 1/2 that size. The fight, was it simply sweat dripping down your forehead with your arms screaming in pain after 15 minutes, or was it give in take? Those massive reels...250 yards on the run?   Tarpon jump a lot...were they acrobatic ...and when you got them to shore, they were all tuckered out?..it doesn't sound like they were if they had there way with you. A few stories of the best or most memorable battles of the week would be much appreciated. This is the type of fishing I might like to do in the future, I want to hear MORE!"
196557,Crazyhook,2008-05-05 01:49:00,1154,"Thanks Dude...  Well we hooked 15 tarpon as a group and 13 got off or broke off. Fishing on the bridge for them is not easy at all. First if you get a big one, you cannot pull up the anchor and chase them. Also the piling that hold up the bridge are filled with barnacles and will cut any line at all that rubs against them. Another problem is the hard mouth of the tarpon... they jump like crazy and have huge runs. They can also breath air so when you think all is ok they get a second wind.  The first one I had on the boat hit while in 3 minutes, I dropped my pinfish down and it got smoked... line poured off the reel and then the fish leaped 3 times. A great fight and I was happy to get it boatside for a pic ( all of which are on my buddy's camera).  We went through loads of 80 and 100 pound fluro...I cannot disclose the secret bait but we found it out early on and it was our key to success.  The biggest tarpon we fought would of been over 170 maybe in the 180 pound range. It was so big only half of it jumped out of the water. During the end of the out going tide we had one fish that jumped, got in the current and was off 300 yards... What a fish. Booking next year for sure again....  As for stories, there are so many. Some have to stay down there ...  my favorite one of the week ( besides the bull shark eating my swimming joe while in the kayak in 40 feet of water)  I see a huge volkswagon sized spotted eagle ray ( the kind that killed a lady in the keys a few weeks back). Behind the ray was a huge cobia. Cobia are great fighters and amazing eating. I had a bucktail on and tried to get the cobia to bite... well I snag the eagle ray in the wing and the fight is on. There was 3 kayakers watcing the fight from a distance . The ray bolts towards them getting closer and closer. About a kayak length away it jumps 8 feet of of the water right beside the lady's kayak... I have never seen 3 people paddle so fast."
