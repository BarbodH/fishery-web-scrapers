May 10th I am holding a ""for fun"" pike tournament on Lake Couchiching.  Lake Simcoe is open to fish, but the launch is at the Town Docks (Couchiching Beach PArk) in Orillia.  Tournament hours are 7:00am - 3:00pm  Cost is $50 per team, plus an additional $10 for big fish, although big fish is optional  It is a 3 fish limit, going by total length rather than total weight.  Please be there no later than 6:30am to register, as I will be fishing the tournament and will be blasting off with the rest of you.  No live bait.  All fish must be angled legally.  If you are interested, please PM me for your blast off position."
196132,silveradosheriff,2008-05-04 02:33:00,1025,What is the payout structure?
196162,steverowbotham,2008-05-04 03:35:00,1800,Depends on the number of teams. I was thinking 70/20/10 percent until we get 10+ teams then we'll see

197753,Cudz,2008-05-07 01:33:00,2652,Couch and Simcoe are open for pike on the 10th? I thought it was the 17th.  I booked off (got permission from wife) because i thought that was opening day.  I suck!
