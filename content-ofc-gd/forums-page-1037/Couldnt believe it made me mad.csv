197550,little angler,2008-05-06 19:28:00,128,"Today at lunch i went out for my break over to the pond by our school with my girlfriend. We were sitting on the greenbox and saw these three kids walk up to a goose and start tormenting it and then one of the took a full kick at the goose hitting it in the head, i couldn't believe it! I tried to say something but my girlfriend told me not to because she didn't want trouble. Such stupidity"
197561,Garry2Rs,2008-05-06 19:38:00,1425,Don't worry there are facilities in Guelph and Kingston where most of those types go to finish their education...grin.
197563,Stoty,2008-05-06 19:40:00,2910,HA HA HA  
197564,Golfisher,2008-05-06 19:42:00,586," The one in Kingston, not a bad place to get your education.  I know a guy who got his Master's from Queen's while serving time for drug-related charges, LOL."
197569,oncogene,2008-05-06 19:43:00,154,  Kingston? I was gona say Queen's....   I wonder what a drug convict would study for a master degree..... chemistry?
197575,Stoty,2008-05-06 19:49:00,2910,HAHAHAHAH
197582,Golfisher,2008-05-06 19:55:00,586,"Chemistry would have been the logical choice, but his degree was in political science.  This was some time ago and so I never met the guy, but he was quite a legendary figure in the department; alternate myth has it that he eventually got a PhD and landed a teaching gig at some university in the Caribbean.  My guess is that he has moved on to Colombia or Boliva by now, LOL."
197583,packrat,2008-05-06 19:56:00,93,Would've served the kid right if the goose had taken a hissy fit and got a little pay back.
197587,oncogene,2008-05-06 20:02:00,154, ... and then there'll be news about a goose attacking kids and the goose being euthanized...
197598,fish_finder,2008-05-06 20:27:00,370,  Sales and economics of course!

197616,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-06 20:55:00,3761,Stupid kid.
197617,motv8tr,2008-05-06 20:57:00,2587,"Well you could have reported them....  still can I imagine, if you cna identify them they could be charged with cuelty to animals....doing nothing just teaches them they can get away with it and may do worse in the future.  Maureen"
197661,Jason Vernooy,2008-05-06 22:39:00,25,"If they spend time in the pen, the word ""goose"" might frighten them"
197685,KyleM,2008-05-06 23:40:00,218,"2R's, Guelph has closed down since the last time you were there"
197688,Garry2Rs,2008-05-06 23:47:00,1425,Oh NO! Were do I go now for the Reunion Dance?
197715,GbayGiant,2008-05-07 00:16:00,1780,"I'm thinking Penetang over the pen they got some mental issues going on, maybe some electroshock therapy would do the trick."
197727,irishfield,2008-05-07 00:47:00,26272,Na John... they stopped doing Labotomies on Tuesdays a couple years back. I do have a good selection of day passes though.....
