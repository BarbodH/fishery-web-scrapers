I arrived at hanlins ppint at 11:30a and started casting a rapala husky jerk from the docks and all along the west side of the channel. In the 8ft-10ft depth i had 2 bites but the pike were just messing around and were very lazy and not aggressive at all. So i decided to change tactics and move to the chartenese booyah spinnerbait with a large colorado blade. However aound 12:30 fishing the stretch of the centre island channel i had some swans join my party. The day went fairly bad with hardly any pike being caught. The water levels were still a foot higher than there regular levels. i only took four photos with my iphone.
