781903,skidoosafari,2013-04-24 11:36:00,46,Always nice to see a comeback like this. Cant say ive ever fished from a ladder tho . http://nyti.ms/11LTCKx
781913,MJL,2013-04-24 12:34:00,2427,"Interesting but the article misses a couple huge hurdles on re-introducing this particular strain of Lahanton cutthroats to pyramid lake.  Pyramid lake over the years has been stocked with “non-pyramid lake” strains of Lahanton cutthroat trout. Is there a difference between the strains? Absolutely. What made the original strain of Lahanton cutthroat trout in Pyramid Lake grow so large was their unique adaptation to voraciously feed on large prey species of fish (ie. Cui ui sucker and the tui chub). If we’re talking about re-introducing and maintaining the original strain in Pyramid lake, you’d have to remove all non-original pyramid lake strains of Lahanton cutthroats from the lake – Or else you’d just water down the genes that made the original strain so unique.  in order to remove the non-original strains of cutthroats from Pyramid lake (perhaps with a poison such as rotenone), you’d have to get permission from the natives – Not likely"
781914,Rich,2013-04-24 12:40:00,3927,I'm more interested how they got out to the ladder without going over their waders. Lol
781937,Musky or Specks,2013-04-24 14:10:00,2710,Me too rich. I was thinking they hop the ladders but thats a recipe for a dunking. Not only the issues you have mentioned MJL but also the fact that spawning habitat is unavailable so the population will never be able to re-establish itself.
