The first photo was taken last year on April 18th. All the lakes and rivers had been open since mid March and this fish marked the impending end to last year's steelhead run. The second photo was taken today! There is still 3 feet of ice on the lakes and no rivers are running more than a trickle. It has been a long winter....I need to get fishing!!!     "
