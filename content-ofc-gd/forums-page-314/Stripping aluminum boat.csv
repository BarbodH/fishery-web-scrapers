780770,Sinker,2013-04-19 15:22:00,8692,"I wwouldnt strip it, just sand, clean, and re-paint.  Stripping it to bare metal is a whole ton of work, and then you will need a sself etching primer before you can paint it again.  Just sand with a fine grit paper, wipe clean with an acetone soaked rag, and paint.  S."

781740,irishfield,2013-04-23 18:11:00,26272,"What the guys are telling you if you're not concerned it's perfect for a 40 year old boat.. depends how pretty you want it.  But if you are going to go through the effort, you may as well do it right...  Get it inside.. coat it with Mar-Hyde Tal-Strip II Aircraft Coating Remover.. let it do it's stuff and then blast it clean with a power washer.  Go down to Carquest or your local jobber (you're gonna be there to get or order in the Mar-Hyde anyhow) and get some self etching primer for aluminum and some PPG fleet paint to cover."
781769,workwear,2013-04-23 21:26:00,592,hey wayne how well does that stripper work.....just a blast from a pressure washer will do??......or is there still scrubbing and sanding to do
781848,irishfield,2013-04-24 01:04:00,26272,"If you get the boat/aircraft inside.. absolutely no breeze.. brush or spray it on and let it do it's stuff... it will wax over and then it goes to work. Trying it outside.. not so well unless it's dead calm. Once it has done it's thing you can then spatula the remover around to stubborn spots and a bit of scrubbing with some scotchbrite should get everything to bare aluminum. Many times if the stripper lifts the paint properly it will come off with the power washer with little or no other work. While you've got the water running...and flushing the remover away.. go to town with the scotchbrite and you're ready for the self etching primer. If you want to go really nuts you can hit it with an acid wash, but with todays paints not really needed. I highly doubt Lund or Princecraft are doing any more than etch primer and top coat."
