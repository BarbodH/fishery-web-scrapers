What a great, inexpensive way to further showcase Toronto to those in North America"
781945,wallyboss,2013-04-24 14:40:00,1095,All that work for 4 games???
781948,BillM,2013-04-24 14:52:00,17367, Let's hope the Leafs sweep the first round
781951,jedimaster,2013-04-24 15:19:00,3472, Pretty sure they will do this for the next rounds as well.
781953,Toad Hunter,2013-04-24 15:29:00,261,GOOOO RAAAAAANGERS !!!!
781984,chuckymcd,2013-04-24 17:49:00,144,They just want to make it red to support the habs on sat. night lol
782005,Toronto_Angler,2013-04-24 19:22:00,698,Well that's one way to conserve energy!
782015,davey buoy,2013-04-24 19:49:00,5505,"Hey,they light it up all night anyways,what a great idea,no extra cost I can see.?Well maybe a goal judge lol."
782030,Twocoda,2013-04-24 20:49:00,4130,Then after they can sell it on eBay as brand new.... Never used
782040,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-24 21:16:00,10439,Heck all they need to do is get one of those Budweiser goal lights and add a relay that turns off the blue lights and flashes some red lights  when the Leafs score. Like how hard could that be?
782097,timmeh,2013-04-24 23:59:00,609, Ya but it will be all set up when they make the playoffs again in 10 years.
