Looked at the pond for a couple minutes and saw fish activity... so I grabbed my rod and hooked into a bunch carps and some gold fish. Nothing massive this is the average size of em, I did land one about 9lbs... which was good fun on a 4'6 ultralight with 6lb line. decent little local spot to fish while nothing else is in season."

781593,hammercarp,2013-04-23 02:11:00,964,A pond full of fun. I bet they did give that ultra light a work out. When the water warms up they will be even friskier.
