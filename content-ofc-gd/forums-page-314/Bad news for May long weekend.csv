782131,danc,2013-04-25 02:04:00,4677,That's bad timing for me. Both me and the booze store might be on strike at the same time.
782132,tb4me,2013-04-25 02:05:00,3295,"There are so many independent wineries and spirits brewers, it would be a stupid move on the LCBO's part to even consider it..One can buy wine just about anywhere now.. The beer store is still open so who really cares anyway.. I say go for it,"
781821,kickingfrog,2013-04-24 00:22:00,8333,"Unionized employees of the #LCBO set a May 17th strike deadline if contract talks don't improve, according to OPSEU.  "
781823,Terry,2013-04-24 00:24:00,14456,shop early  shop often
781825,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-24 00:32:00,2582,5 cases of red and 5 cases of white in the basement. I'm pretty sure we can weather it.
781826,kickingfrog,2013-04-24 00:32:00,8333,Should added: Only in Ontario.
781827,kickingfrog,2013-04-24 00:33:00,8333,What about the next weekend?
781828,Terry,2013-04-24 00:34:00,14456,we don't care about anywhere else...lol
781829,Locnar,2013-04-24 00:35:00,645,"In my opinion, the LCBO shouldn't exist at all. Alcohol should be sold anywhere that wants to sell alcohol. The government monopoly over alcohol is preposterous. They receive 0 sympathy from me."
781830,Tayzak15,2013-04-24 00:35:00,318,"Luckily I don't drink so this doesn't effect me, but feel bad for people on the may long weekend that will get screwed over."
781831,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-24 00:37:00,2582,If the strike lasts over a year I might start to worry.
781833,Nipfisher,2013-04-24 00:43:00,2449,BEER!
781834,ketchenany,2013-04-24 00:48:00,3229,Lots of private wineries and beer outlets . . .  I make my own. They don't see me much at all.  I have a 64 crown Royal and a 1977 King's Rasnsom that I could part with the right $s lol.
781839,fishing n autograph,2013-04-24 00:52:00,2540,I've got 8 24s inu beer fridge I'm good lol
781840,Tayzak15,2013-04-24 00:52:00,318,"Might have very high demand for that in a couple of weeks, time to start a bidding war lol"
781860,irishfield,2013-04-24 02:09:00,26272,I guess they have a 4 year contract. Why I found my sisters Jimmy stuffed full of booze when she died in 2009... as her and her friends were afraid they'd have no booze for the big party in Tweed! They seem to be a month or so early this time though...
781876,dhickey,2013-04-24 03:50:00,1038,Im lucky this time aruond.  Ill be working on the long weekend.  It doesnt effect my favorate store in the whole WORLD  The Beer Store..  I remember lining up for 30 mins just to grab a 24 from the Molson plant 427 and 401 AHHHRRGGGG....  The sore spot should be all of the independt LCBO retailers seing as they have payed the money to carry a licience to sell spirits/wine and beer.
781891,fishindevil,2013-04-24 08:27:00,6254,"That's always the advantage of fishing the Ottawa river !!!!! Just cross over into Quebec and its all good !!!!! I remember back when beer stores were closed on Sundays and we would just motor over to Quebec and get beer or whatever !!!! Could buy worms,beer and a bottle of rye,as well as get our grocery supplies all in one general store !!!!!! Ontario is so bass-akwards we are still in the dark ages compared to other provinces !!!!!!!!"
781899,ketchenany,2013-04-24 10:50:00,3229,"And noe they are missing a bottle worth $26,000. Ok which one of you ordered it?  My Crown and Kings ransom would be a lot cheaper!"
781901,mercman,2013-04-24 11:26:00,7054,"That brings back paniced memories LOL. Thank God i quit 23 years ago, or i would be all sweaty and shakey just thinking about it"
781902,F7Firecat,2013-04-24 11:28:00,347,Forty Creek outlet store in Grimsby.....nuf said!!
781909,lew,2013-04-24 12:13:00,12766,"Looking at the other side of the coin, if the booze stores are closed, it may just make the hiways safer...just sayin."
781923,mr blizzard,2013-04-24 13:17:00,1589,Right on
781925,SirCranksalot,2013-04-24 13:25:00,3291," The last time the Beer Store went on strike a friend of mine said he was forced to drink American beer!! So I had to ask ""Who forced you""?"
781930,mirogak,2013-04-24 13:45:00,387,I make my own wine
781939,NAW,2013-04-24 14:14:00,4022,I signed a petition they had at my local convenience store regarding that!  I'll have to fire up the still!
782014,BootScoot,2013-04-24 19:47:00,5,100% agreed....gotta love government monopolies.
