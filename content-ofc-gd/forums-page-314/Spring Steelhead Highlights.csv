As usual I fished a lot, averaging 3 days a week during prime time.  Managed to get out with a few different OFC friends.  Chris (live2fish85)      Fidel (Highdrifter)        Aaron Shirley     'Course I managed a few myself.                   The ""Michigan Dirty"" in action:       The biggest highlight for me is always fishing with my young son Brendan and we managed to get out together a few times when the conditions were just right. Here's a few pictures and video clips from our trip to a favored Stateside trib. We hit it right on the button after a heavy rainfall when it was dropping and clearing. Oodles of fresh chrome steelhead, and almost no one on the river.                  Can you tell he's happy?     Managed a few video clips as well.  Here he is briefly attached to a really hot chrome fish  http://www.youtube.com/embed/Cr0WeULkz_k"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>   And a couple more landed on dad's centerpin.  http://www.youtube.com/embed/KFBsnIb3jJk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>  http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZROl872cQPo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>   This particular fish was special. I built the rod in 1987 for my uncle who very recently passed away. I recently reaquired it and it's Brendan's rod now. There's a lot of meaning and a lot of memories attached to it, and watching my son land a fish with it was therapeutic.  http://www.youtube.com/embed/9akyLZ9msd0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>    Hope you enjoyed, cheers"

My son just turned 18, seeing those pictures makes me wish I could turn the tables back, best time of your life, look forward to seeing more postings, have a great weekend."
781024,lew,2013-04-20 14:54:00,12766,"Outstanding Mike, specially getting out with your son like that !!"
781047,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-20 16:00:00,2050,"awesome stuff Mike!  Love the shots and videos of Brendan - maybe he'll have his own all steelhead fishing show some day! haha  Cheers, Ryan"
781050,solopaddler,2013-04-20 16:04:00,8605,"Thanks guys, Brendan is a natural that's for sure. He does his dad proud."
781064,Cosmos,2013-04-20 17:19:00,588,Thank you for sharing. Awesome pictures.
781068,Twocoda,2013-04-20 17:52:00,4130,Ya know.... a good story teller can stir emotions as they relate to the readers experiences. Keep the camera glued to your son Mike. They grow too fast. Even when Brendan is well into his adulthood... You are always going visualise this little man everytime he is beside you connected to a fish. He is a lucky lucky boy... And your a lucky dad... Thanks for sharing your own (hopefully) not too soon to be memories and stirring mine up
781073,spincast,2013-04-20 18:11:00,3279,nice collection of fish - and memories - there Mike.   Looking forward to making some more this year too - if that darn weather would just make up its mind - and stay warm.
781084,davey buoy,2013-04-20 18:27:00,5505,"Beautiful pics Mike,and the young fellow truly enjoys it!!! I can see a future best fishing buddy there."
781125,RickOnt,2013-04-20 21:03:00,669,"Another 'Great' report there Mike!  That pic of Brendon leaning waaay back is a 'Best' of For Sure!  Its fantastic, you are making the best of your time together, as kids really do grow up too fast.  Cheers Rick"
781170,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-04-20 23:34:00,310,"Awesome fishing, specifically with your son!!!"
781172,misfish,2013-04-20 23:39:00,29133,"I dont know how you can stand , fishing shoulder to shoulder stuff. The crowds  crazy.LOL  Brendan is a chip of the ole man.  Nice waters"
781175,Christopheraaron,2013-04-20 23:47:00,3525,"Nice, Bendan outfishes me!"
781355,Moosebunk,2013-04-21 23:03:00,3970,Steelheading just comes easy to you Mike.  Lifetime of bangin' bows I guess... that you'll pass on to the wee lad making him a lethal tribber in years to come.  Solid fishing!
781359,Rod Caster,2013-04-21 23:39:00,5784,Awesome.... you even have me all primed up... and I don't even have any steelhead rivers nearby haha.
781392,dewar,2013-04-22 01:32:00,5,"amazing fish, thanx for the inspiration, I can't wait to get out on some water with my lad and reel in a few smiles"
781402,Jet,2013-04-22 02:26:00,364,Great picture report and even cooler to watch the progression of your son under your tutelage. Don't think there's a better Steelhead teacher out there!
781453,mirogak,2013-04-22 16:10:00,387,nice fishing Mike ... wish my dad fished
781566,Ron,2013-04-23 00:49:00,1683,"Of all the pictures, this one is the most meaningful to me. Excellent shot. Tells more to the story than any words you can add. A great moment shared right there.  Cheers, Ron..."
781573,solopaddler,2013-04-23 01:02:00,8605,"Thanks for the kind words everyone!  It's funny how boys and girls have such seemingly stereotypical interests even when they're raised exactly the same way. (at least mine do!) I suppose it's societies influence as well as their peers.  My son at 6 years old is already a rabid angler, he loves the sport. My 9 year old daughter not quite as much. She's been exposed to a lot in her young life yet doesn't have the same spark my son does.  And that's fine, you can't force kids to like something. The biggest goal with my daughter is to try and instill a real love of the outdoors and wild places in her. I've already got a bit of a start with that, but what I think I need to do is start bringing her on canoe trips. I really think she'll take to the sense of adventure, setiing up camp, lighting campfires and everything else that goes with it.  I'm going to try anyway.  It's all about the kids, there's nothing better."
