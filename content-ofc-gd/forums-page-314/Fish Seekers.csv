781686,SirCranksalot,2013-04-23 13:31:00,3291,These Fish Seekers were mentioned in another thread. Anybody else had experience with them? Thxs  http://www.davisnet.com/marine/products/marine_product.asp?pnum=00510
781723,Freshtrax,2013-04-23 16:09:00,2215,"Lol I am curious also,  I'm gonna order a few and try em out.   I'll get back to you in the fall"
781726,smitty55,2013-04-23 16:17:00,928,I used them last year after they were recommended to me. Worked quite well on a line counter reel with a medium heavy rod. Not near as much drag as with a pink lady or dipsy. For the price they are well worth it. Can be used for multiple species as well as they are totally adjustable for depth. Cheers
781728,smitty55,2013-04-23 16:27:00,928,One thing to remember is that they won't work with deep divers as it will trip the unit. Spoons are fine. Cheers
781737,Oryx,2013-04-23 17:31:00,186,can you put a flasher or a Spn Dr on it?
781738,SirCranksalot,2013-04-23 17:44:00,3291,"It's not clear from the link I posted how they trip. Are they similar to the Tadpole, another device I've just recently become aware of? I'm thinking of trying one or the other, or maybe both, to catch lakers in 20-30 fow. I use Big O's a lot for bass, walleye, and pike. I don't know if they would trip the Seeker(they are a relatively shallow diver.)  http://www.offshoretackle.com/resettable_diving_weights.html"
781922,Rich,2013-04-24 13:16:00,3927,"Wow I would like to get me some of those. I can see those being useful for some small, electric only lakes near here with deep brown trout."
781941,mr blizzard,2013-04-24 14:29:00,1589,"My buddy back  in Barrie uses and likes them he has success down to approx. 30 feet, uses around BBP quite a bit.  I stayed with the dipsey diver on lake Muskoka, found  that I could get down to 50 feet, even though my arms were 3 inches longer after an hour of trolling lol,  The trip mechanism on the fish seeker seems a bit easier to work with, but overall he is very happy with them."
