781660,fishing n autograph,2013-04-23 11:13:00,2540,"Who knows really what happened. I know things or people can be missed or overlooked. It happens. The bomb squad was there but were they in the exact area where the explosions were? Not everyone was stopped and searche when going to the marathon so it's very likely that they could have been missed.    It's seems though that a lot of small groups of ""terrorists"" have been active. Spain also caught two males who had the same style as the marathon bombers."
781662,fishing n autograph,2013-04-23 11:16:00,2540,"Things don't add up because the media slants everything. Not only that, it's an ongoing investigation so the BPD and FBI aren't going to release every detail"
781663,jedimaster,2013-04-23 11:17:00,3472,Concipracy theories aside.... they ran from police while throwing pipe bombs and shooting at them. Get real. How many pipe bombs do you have readily available just in case you were framed.
781664,lew,2013-04-23 11:25:00,12766,I ran a call one time where a kid was making a pipe bomb in his kitchen and it exploded and blew both his hands off.  I didn't feel the least bit sorry for him.
781666,Rich,2013-04-23 11:26:00,3927,"Well, in theory if i found a car with keys in it, the FBI started chasing me in unmarked cars, began shooting at me, and i found a bunch of pipe bombs and guns.. i'd probably fight for my life with the weapons at hand... Just saying.  Do I believe that? No. But I'm not certain the shooting pipe bomb throwers were the marathon bombers. Earlier in the week they expedited a Saudi nationalist for associations with the bombing, then delcared it was a war cry from Chechnia. Now it's Syrians with internet terror training. I think they jumped the gun to appease the masses, personally. But like I said, I have no proof. Just questions and theories."
781668,Rich,2013-04-23 11:34:00,3927,"You also have to remember that to terrorists this is considered a victory, and many groups would attempt to take credit for this. As disgusting as that is."
781669,jedimaster,2013-04-23 11:34:00,3472,"People have been wrongly accused of all sorts of things but find me one incident where someone who was photographed at the scene of the crime and video taped by different sources then within hours they were stealing a car, confessing to people and lobbing bombs out the window at police while in a gun fight. Do you thunk that they were just there to watch the race? Or do you think maybe nasa implanted clones for all the pictures. There was a picture of one of the bombers standing behind the boy that died."
781671,fishing n autograph,2013-04-23 11:46:00,2540,Not to mention the guy in custody was bragging to a friend at the gym hours after the bombing that what had happened was easy to do

Look at all the people the internet superheros pinned as suspects that weren't related to the bombing at all.    These are the same type of people that put those pics together trying to prove their point.     Can you see why I find this so funny?"

What I find deplorable is the amount of ridicule shown here to people who have questions, may look outside the box, or basically just have an opinion that differs from the 'group mind set'.  Bullying has been in the news quite a bit, citing occurrences at schools, clubs, the work place, facebook and other social media sources. What I understand is one of the common denominators of the victims of bullying is that they don't fit into what is considered the norm.  They are ridiculed for being different. They are ridiculed for not fitting into what is considered normal, as well as other reasons.  The goal of social bullying is to belittle another individual.  In my opinion, the ridiculing going on here is bullying.  I find it distasteful, deplorable, and childish.  "
781739,Tayzak15,2013-04-23 17:44:00,318,"Unfortunately I have to agree with you. Not much can be done with some people that are so close minded though. Question something that's out of the norm and you're instantly deemed a ""tin foil hat"" type of person. Doesn't bother me though, I like studying as many different views as possible before making a decision, If some people aren't willing to do that themselves and just follow what a news network says that's their choice as well."

You gotta realize none of us will ever understand what exactly happened there, not a single source is 100% accurate that we will ever hear from. Just trying to open up another direction towards what happened in Boston rather that making a decision solely on the Major t.v networks."
781631,BillM,2013-04-23 03:51:00,17367, You're trying to open up another direction?   By trying to somehow relate what happened in Sandy Hook to the bombings in Boston?   That's full on tinfoil type stuff man..
781632,Tayzak15,2013-04-23 03:56:00,318,"What in the world does this have to do with Sandy Hook? I never mentioned it at all. I know one of the pictures compares the principal from sandy hook t a resident living near the bombings, but I never mentioned Sandy Hook. Using the ""tinfoil"" excuse is just ignorant. Its not my fault some people are too lazy to educate themselves from every single point of view."
781633,BillM,2013-04-23 04:04:00,17367,"It's got nothing to do with being lazy and all to do with having common sense, which you seem to be lacking.    Stay in school kid."
781635,John Bacon,2013-04-23 04:06:00,3277," How do you know that the pictures are real?  They could be fake, staged or photo-shopped; how would you be able to verify that they are genuine?  The ones published by CNN have more credibility because they usually verify sources; but even then we cannot 100% certain because sometimes they may rush a picture or story to be first."
781636,Tayzak15,2013-04-23 04:14:00,318,"Both sources have questionable credibility of course, but the videos, raw footage of those raids on friday were real. Looked a lot more like a test drill for something."

Obviously the guy who posted it has never been in a high risk situation involving fire arms or explosives not have they dealt with armed a$$&@&? Who shoot 200 rounds and lob explosives at you.  All this rhetoric makes me sick
781650,fishing n autograph,2013-04-23 06:43:00,2540,And FYI their motive was religion..... The living suspect already admitted that
781651,mrdylan,2013-04-23 06:59:00,111,"Normally I am not into these kind of theories etc but but I wonder if they jumped the gun on these 2 maybe just to try and avoid another 911 type fear/scare situation?  As of yet there isn't a single photo ""released"" that shows these 2 without the back packs what so ever but they say they do have video I would hope that eventually it is released to ease such minds!! They still have them listed as suspects even though the younger one has now been charged. All they found for proof in his room was the clothes he was wearing the day of the bombing and something tells me if they were going to get rid of all of the evidence why wouldn't they get rid of the clothes as well? The young one also continued to party the rest of the week on his campus which if he was guilty would show no remorse and this does not fit with the description that everyone gives about him, really being only 19 years old he should have been sh*tting himself couped up in his room about getting caught. Certain things don't add up here and I hope all of these details get released.  I am not sure that this is part of some elaborate plan but I hope they got the right guys because one is dead and the other is pretty close. All i'm saying is that according to what is being shown to us from several media sites there isn't a lot of proof here and I hope that they have actually have some and that it comes out before or during the trial.  The whole thing is horrible no matter how you look at it, I feel for the people suffering due to this."
781654,Rich,2013-04-23 10:18:00,3927,"Yeah, well he wrote it down due to that shot to the throat, self inflicted, he somehow survived and recovered from in 3 days."
781655,Rich,2013-04-23 10:24:00,3927,"Sheep drive me nuts.  There's a million things that dont add up about the bombings. I have questions, not theories. I haven't heard any good theories as to why they would fake this, besides to push CISPA unnoticed.  How does one who managed to get bombs into a public marathon, during a BOMB SEARCH, which just happened to be right then, then he evades an entire police force all week, while his bro splits up? And takes a bullet, they still have no clue where this criminal genius in. So he tries to off himself, and for some reason chooses a throat shot, which is incredibly naiive. Like somebody who has never used a gun or watched a movie. And after trying to off himself, nothing to live for, he for some reason describes his motives to the police, by writing them down?  It doesn't add up. And one proven fact about the event is they openly said they were doing a bomb drill, bomb sniffing K9' s were about, there were people on megaphones saying the upcoming explosions were nothing to be alarmed about.  Just question it, don't theorize, but don't accept the first theory thrown at you by CNN as fact. Remember CNN has been sued twice, and LOST, for being paid to misrepresent the news."
781657,fishing n autograph,2013-04-23 10:38:00,2540,"I don't listen to CNN lol they are as reliable as fox news  The throat shot can be explained. There are people who do missed self inflicted head shots when the panic. Believe it or not, once you see it first hand you'll believe it."
781658,Rich,2013-04-23 10:59:00,3927,"Seems to be a lotta push of ""they used gunpowder bomns, instructions from internet"" . Wow really coincides with recent gun restriction and internet privacy acts.  They targeted the marathon ""because it was easy"" ...  There was a bomb squad there! If that was easy, then they DO need some serious funding in their law enforcement!"

But just coming from common sense, if average joe citizen is told that there is a guy who's armed and dangerous, who's blown 3 people up, killed a cop, robbed a 7-11 and car jacked a woman and he could be hiding on your property, most people would say go look by all means.  It was done for Tory Stafford, Cecilia Zhang, Alicia Ross etc etc... It's not a police state when everything that is done is so scrutinized that cops are on trial for what they may have done wrong and not the accused. The majority of the public wants to help.  And contrary to popular beliefs warrants are not easy to get. You have to have proof that there is reasonable and probable grounds that what you're looking for is there."

We see it all the time on the news in other countries.   I still dont see this ,SET UP ,thing.   What I find weird is,friends are coming forth now. How he was a great guy,volunter to a kids group. I think the older brother was the pressure here. Not that his actions should be defaulted,but well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Get him alive,and find out.  If he,s guilty,death penalty."

780826,Tayzak15,2013-04-19 20:30:00,318,"Not saying hes guilty or innocent, but they had very little evidence to be targeting these boys in the first place. Keep him alive and put him through a fair trial. Make them prove that he is guilty."

Screaming at them, calling them looser.  Saying they where out of control.  And the father had no influence on them.  Said the family will never forgive them. And if the one son is listening, to turn him self in, and seek forgiveness from the families of the victims   Total different mentality then the Aunt from T.O.   Saw a interview with the Dad too.  He also thinks they have some how been set up as well...."
