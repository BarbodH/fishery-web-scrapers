781634,BillM,2013-04-23 04:04:00,17367,"21km/h from the south?  I wouldn't want to be up there, it will be rockin' and rollin' for sure."

781641,jedimaster,2013-04-23 04:24:00,3472,I was thinking couch would be a safer bet.
781772,LefroyFisherman,2013-04-23 21:46:00,602,"My rule of thumb is I won't go out in anything more then a 15km north or south wind, or a 20km east or west wind on Cooks. Just not worth it for a few fish. I've had some scary trips going back across in high winds."
