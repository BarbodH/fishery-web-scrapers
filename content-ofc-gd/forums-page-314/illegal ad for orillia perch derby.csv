781480,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-22 18:10:00,4399,Doesn`t hurt to ask I guess!
781483,jimmer,2013-04-22 18:13:00,2730,That's kind of creative. He might be given some tips on a hot spot. Is there a rule in the derby that says he can't do this? What makes it illegal if you don't mind me asking?
781494,captpierre,2013-04-22 20:00:00,2521,I think I'ld take up another sport if you can't catch a perch on Simcoe/Couch
781496,davey buoy,2013-04-22 20:04:00,5505,I'd say . lol.
781497,ratherboutdoors,2013-04-22 20:07:00,132,"Thats funny!  FYI  Rules #  7. Each person in a boat must be registered in the Festival or their daily catch will not be eligible nor shall the catch taken that day by any other fisherman in the same boat, whether registered or not, be eligible.  11. Any entrant who uses anything whatsoever to attempt to falsely represent themselves or the fish they have caught shall be immediately disqualified from this and future Festivals. All prizes and awards will be forfeited back to the Festival."
781500,cheaptackle,2013-04-22 20:18:00,849,Yeah he probably just wanted them to enter in the daily draw - must be awful desperate or lazy to make such a plea to be able to maybe win a draw for something only to be disqualified if found out - yup - on with the rest of the day!  Michael
781515,Rod Caster,2013-04-22 21:42:00,5784,Ha! That's such a dumb request.
781522,tb4me,2013-04-22 22:07:00,3295,lol
781554,BillM,2013-04-22 23:46:00,17367,"About as bad as some of the folks that come here with their first posts and ask for fishing spots, lol."
781672,Angler management,2013-04-23 11:48:00,280,"Nothing wrong with asking for a good spot IMO, but asking for fish in a tourney is just pathetic..."
781673,HTHM,2013-04-23 12:02:00,4082,"What, I'm not allowed to do that!?"
781675,jedimaster,2013-04-23 12:14:00,3472,Anyone know what the wave report is like near the narrows. Trying to decide between crappie on a smaller lake or perch on sim/cooch
781677,Angler management,2013-04-23 12:22:00,280,I heard that the crappie were smashing on scugog yesterday... Might be a safer bet!
781680,jedimaster,2013-04-23 12:41:00,3472,Yah not a big fan of 20k winds on simcoe.
781695,mr blizzard,2013-04-23 14:11:00,1589,x3 sounds like they were couch potatoes just wanting to try to enter for a prize
