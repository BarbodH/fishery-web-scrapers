My research tells me that Holland River is my best bet, should I be looking for shore fishing spots near the mouth of the Holland River?? Anyone familiar with the area?  Thanks!"
781730,kickingfrog,2013-04-23 16:49:00,8333,"Right in Barrie you can get perch from shore, but I've never caught, or heard of anyone catching crappie there."
781733,Christopheraaron,2013-04-23 17:00:00,3525,I'll pm you
781751,Beans,2013-04-23 19:56:00,3339,I would try off the little dock on the north side of the bridge in Bradford...
781752,misfish,2013-04-23 20:08:00,29133,"Not to be rude,but if anyone getting crappie on Lake Simcoe,their keeping it to them selves.  Good luck.  Ya what Mr.Beans said. Hope your not looking for a feed though. YUKKKKKKKKK"
781764,Christopheraaron,2013-04-23 20:43:00,3525,"ya, that's a good spot. If you don't see crappie there are usually some perch and catfish under the dock, sometimes it gets flooded though."

781770,Christopheraaron,2013-04-23 21:42:00,3525,"LOL, I made some good friends there last year"
781791,addy79,2013-04-23 22:24:00,573,"Yeah, spoke with the guys at JB's this afternoon and they told me NOT to eat what you catch there b/c of the fertilizer runoff...  Thanks for the advice and pm's everyone"
781822,Christopheraaron,2013-04-24 00:22:00,3525,"Good luck, they are on fire south of simcoe! 20 fish on the fly in an hour"
