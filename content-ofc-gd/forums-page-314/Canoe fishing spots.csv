780686,Shloim,2013-04-19 00:57:00,515,Hi all I just completed some work on my fishing canoe. It's becoming quite the beast. I've got stability pontoons and a trolling motor going already. All I need now are some good spots to fish from it... Suggestions???
780691,NAW,2013-04-19 01:18:00,4022,What area are you looking for?  I can think of a few hundred thousand spots off the top if my head.
780693,Christopheraaron,2013-04-19 01:19:00,3525,"Yup, especially with added stability you can take it most places!"
780732,Rich,2013-04-19 11:11:00,3927,"Anywhere your little heart desires, you have no limits now."
780742,Shloim,2013-04-19 11:58:00,515,"I'm in Toronto so of like to stay within 60-90minutes away, if possible? I'm a full catch and release guy so any fish I catch will be there to fight another day."
780745,SirCranksalot,2013-04-19 12:56:00,3291,Come bass season float down the Grand from Glen Morris to Paris---lots of bass!
780747,Shloim,2013-04-19 13:11:00,515,I was gonna give that a try once my boating skills developed a bit more... I'm gonna try cooks bay around the canals in Keswick  on Sunday
780748,davey buoy,2013-04-19 13:16:00,5505,"Be careful on Cooks!,it can blow up quick on canoe's. I'd think you would want more experiance out there. You can get pretty far from shore. Lot's of open water."
780755,Shloim,2013-04-19 13:47:00,515,Anywhere else you'd suggest? I'm not opposed to not getting killed...
780759,Shloim,2013-04-19 13:55:00,515,So is it true that little lake In Barrie sucks for fishing?
780760,EC1,2013-04-19 13:57:00,930,"I personally like either the smallest water, or biggest water possible. Get to the places the big boats can't, and when they're not in shallow.... go out to where the big boats go.  Still have yet to get my canoe on Kempenfelt though.  By now, practically any lake around the latitudes of the Kawartha's are good to go - Good luck!"
780857,moxie,2013-04-19 22:00:00,1566,"Try the Maskinonge(I think that's what its called) in Keswick.  We've hit it for perch, crappie and bass. A lot of water to fish and decent protection from any wind so you can hone your paddling skills."
781293,Dave Bailey,2013-04-21 15:56:00,1641,"Frenchmans Bay in Pickering. There's a launch at the sandbar at the southwest end, off Beachpoint Promenade, or from the east side at the north end of Progress Frenchmans Bay East Park on Front Road."
781302,Toad Hunter,2013-04-21 16:31:00,261, x2 (but don't go any further north - Cambridge and up is my territory  )
781322,Rich,2013-04-21 20:02:00,3927,"Go all the way to Brantford! Camp on the way! I did that trip once, it was epic, one of the best trips of my life."
781323,misfish,2013-04-21 20:12:00,29133," YES The only real bites are,horse and deer flys. Man those buggers hurt,and are annoying."
781555,Shloim,2013-04-22 23:54:00,515,I'm actually even allergic to those stinking bites
781701,mirogak,2013-04-23 14:41:00,387,Frenchman's Bay like Dave said. All kinds of fish there.
781722,Freshtrax,2013-04-23 16:06:00,2215,"Rouge river , put in at rouge park .  Nice paddle. And you never know what you will catch,"
