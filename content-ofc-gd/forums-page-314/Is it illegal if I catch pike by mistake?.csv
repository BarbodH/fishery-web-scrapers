782202,juan96,2013-04-25 15:26:00,23,"Hello  I have plan paddling to Toronto Island this Saturday and fishing for Trout.  But I wondering if I catch the pike by mistake, is it illegal? Toronto Island is Zone 20 and pike will be open 1st Sat in May but Trout is now open.  I catch and release all the time so should be no issue?"
782204,outllaw,2013-04-25 15:36:00,1232,just go have fun.
782207,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-25 15:46:00,4399,"Targeting Pike would be illegal,if your trying to catch Trout with a Mepps Musky Killer or something similar then you might have a problem. If your in a spot and your catching one Pike after another then move.  If you not targeting them I wouldn`t worry too much."
782209,TennesseeGuy,2013-04-25 15:57:00,957,"You'll be okay as long as fishcop, Don Maw, is in NW Ontario.   He'd love catching you with illegal pike slime on your hands."
782213,capt bruce,2013-04-25 16:21:00,820,In 30 + years of fishing lake o and the harbour NEVER heard of anyone fishing for trout at the islands unless you count the early 80's when they tryed to get a trout pond going . would be hard to get anyone to believe you were trying for trout .. Try asbridges bay may still be some browns around but the islands ?????????
782217,BillM,2013-04-25 16:32:00,17367,"As Bruce said, the Islands + trout doesn't make much sense."
782226,Christopheraaron,2013-04-25 17:05:00,3525,I'm guessing he means in the bay
782227,Rich,2013-04-25 17:07:00,3927,Of course there's trout at the islands. It doesn't take years of experience to figure that out. Good luck trout fishing.
782246,Ben_Daniels,2013-04-25 19:05:00,435,"There are definitely brown trout in the canals in the Toronto Islands, I've seen groups of them chasing bait. I wouldn't say that there are enough to legitimately go out and target them though, you would probably catch more Pike when targeting trout in there IMO. If I were you I'd hold off fishing the Islands until Pike opens, much better places to target trout than the islands anyway."
782250,Rich,2013-04-25 19:19:00,3927,"Indeed. Far better places to fish trout than that, you'd be better off on hamilton harbour. But they are there. From the sounds of it you're kinda hoping to catch pike on trout lures. If that's the case, it will be the CO who determines if he believes you are targetting pike, or trout. Chances are if all you've caught is pike all day, they'll ding you for pike fishing. Just saying."
782252,Terry,2013-04-25 19:22:00,14456,is it legal to keep a deer that I have hit with my truck   how far off the road am I allowed  to drive to hit it
782255,Rich,2013-04-25 19:32:00,3927,"You could always use a nightcrawler on bottom or under a float, or maybe bottom bounce a roe bag. Then there would be no confusion."
782273,davey buoy,2013-04-25 20:15:00,5505,"As mentioned don't go using pike lures or big stuff,that would entice a Pike. worm,small spinner,along those lines should mean you aren't targeting them. You put a line in the water you really could catch anything ,make sure you cover your  ,that's all."
782350,Jacob,2013-04-25 23:20:00,186,That's exactly how i feel about this.  I'd fish somewhere else for now.
782364,Acountdeleted,2013-04-25 23:57:00,2562, Thanks for the chuckle Terry. I can't stop laughing.
782368,BillM,2013-04-26 00:11:00,17367,"Terry is a stone cold killer, lol!"
782376,Roy,2013-04-26 00:35:00,13728,Y'know you can wait a week if it'll help you sleep better.
782387,danc,2013-04-26 00:56:00,4677,Every Pike I catch is by mistake. I say go for it.
782395,BillM,2013-04-26 01:58:00,17367,"Dan, you love those toothy critters!   :)"
782401,TheMaverick,2013-04-26 02:05:00,93, 
782402,irishfield,2013-04-26 02:08:00,26272, Cripes... he almost shot me for just bringing it in the boat!  
782410,BillM,2013-04-26 02:50:00,17367,"Wayne, I've very surprised he let you bring that into the boat, lol!!!!"
782411,irishfield,2013-04-26 02:53:00,26272,Yah.. Bunk took the picture! lol  Now back to targeting trout...
