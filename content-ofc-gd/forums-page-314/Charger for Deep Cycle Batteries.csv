781841,Matt Janes,2013-04-24 00:56:00,49,"Just wondering what other members are using to charge their deep cycle batteries. I'm in the market for a new charger. Anyone use the Noco Genius line of chargers? A friend of mine has a nautilus and seems to like it quite a bit. I'm not looking for an on board and trying to spend around $100.  Thanks,  Matt"
781845,bigmac1984,2013-04-24 01:01:00,193,I have 2 of these that I use to charge my batterieson the boat. I have had zero issue with them. I am sure there are better out there but it does the trick.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/3/Batteries/BatteryChargers/PRD~0111504P/MotoMaster+12%2B2A++Automatic+Battery+Charger+with+75A+Engine.jsp?locale=en
781861,Old Man,2013-04-24 02:20:00,822,Identical to the one I use. Had it for years now. No problems with it.
781890,davey buoy,2013-04-24 08:21:00,5505,That makes three of us.lol. Works fine as said.
781892,lew,2013-04-24 08:35:00,12766,Best one I ever owned was a Guest charger.
781895,Roy,2013-04-24 09:52:00,13728," Yep, a Guest on board charger for me too. It's just so much easier to just get home, plug the boat in and you're good to go. Same if you're away for more than a couple of days at a lodge or camp....plug the boat in and you're ready to go anytime."
781904,hotsky,2013-04-24 11:37:00,400,Keep an out out on Canadain tire. I got a marine one Motomaster Nautilus for $50 on sale that was 100$ reg price. they had other on sale as well.
781906,aplumma,2013-04-24 11:59:00,6896,Guest also for me. I have my batteries load tested at the start of the season and the 7 that are on guest charger are going on there 6th season and reading at over 80% for the lowest one. My little pond boat has been maintained on a Black and decker smart charger and it failed at 4 seasons. It could be just the way I use them but I think the key is a good charger that is plugged in quickly after every trip.   Art
781907,BillM,2013-04-24 12:05:00,17367,Add another Guest onboard charger to the list as well.
781963,Peps,2013-04-24 16:35:00,191,Who sells Guest Chargers?
781967,lew,2013-04-24 16:51:00,12766,"I may be wrong, but I think BPS carries the Guest charger."
781979,BillM,2013-04-24 17:31:00,17367,"West Marine does as well, that's where I bought mine."
781997,davey buoy,2013-04-24 18:55:00,5505,"My boat has a  alternater. Maybe that doesn't count. If I don't get get out in three weeks,I often put the two amp charge on a day or two earlier just for insurance."
782003,Roy,2013-04-24 19:21:00,13728,I got my Guest from Thomas Marine in Varennes QC. It was the same price as Cabela's.
782013,jedimaster,2013-04-24 19:44:00,3472,"I have a minkota single bank, onboard. It works ok I guess. I mean it charges it. So I guess thats all its supposed to do.  haha"
782027,Gerritt,2013-04-24 20:17:00,6129,I have this one http://www.boschautoparts.com/Batteries/Pages/C3BatteryCharger.aspx and an old school CTC charger like the ones mentioned about..  I like the C3 alot more small and light weight and can be left outdoors unlike the old school CTC ones.  I bought my C3 @ CTC for 69.99  G
782045,wormdunker,2013-04-24 21:30:00,1711,"I have a battery tender plus.  Good unit.  The major factor for me is you can leave it plugged in & won't damage your battery.  Flashing green light to let you know your battery is 80% charged, solid green light to say your battery is now fully charged.  $75.00 at Ramakkos in Sudbury."
