I have fitted the cork to the butt of a rod and need to know what glue would do the job of holding the rings together and on the blank.? This is a one time thing."
781463,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-22 16:30:00,10439,"I use RodBond gel adhesive for gluing up my cork as well as mounting the handle, butt cap and reel seat.  http://www.u-40.com/rodbond.html"
781469,kemper,2013-04-22 16:51:00,2232,"The rod bond is great. If you don't want to wait for that or pay for shipping head over to Canadian Tire and pick up some 40-minute 2 part epoxy. Works like a charm, I've never had anything come loose using either method.  Make sure you remember to scuff the finish on the blank where the handle will be!"
