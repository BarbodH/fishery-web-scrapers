781576,reelinrolly,2013-04-23 01:10:00,281,"Heh guys.  Got the boat out for the first time yesterday and noticed the steering was quite stiff.  The steering link rod needs greasing.  My question is, since there is no fitting to grease the shaft,  do I just apply grease by hand on the retracted shaft?  Thanks guys"
781580,Entropy,2013-04-23 01:24:00,747,"Yep, that's how I do it.  Greese it by the motor and perhaps under the dash, although I think mine has a cover on it under the dash.  Use a marine greese or other that is good for use around water."
781647,fish_fishburn,2013-04-23 05:37:00,1311,If its cable steering its more then likely the cable. You cant lube it has to be changed.
781682,ecmilley,2013-04-23 12:57:00,2163,"could have ice in it, but the cables require yearly lubrication, just spread it on the exposed areas and work it back and forth if it doesn'r free up will require new cables"
781687,reelinrolly,2013-04-23 13:32:00,281,How hard are the cables to replace.  I'm pretty new to outboards.  Better to just have a mechanic look at it?
781691,ecmilley,2013-04-23 13:47:00,2163,"depends on the boat but overall to to hard to fish them in and attach, hardest part is being a contorsionist and attaching to helm"
781693,mr blizzard,2013-04-23 14:01:00,1589,"Like the others have said it could be frayed cables  We had to replace the cables on our old glastron a few years ago  After the cables were replaced along with a new motor our steering became stiff on Sparrow Lake while trying to go to Glouster Pool.  The mechanic forgot to grease the steering column,  I took the shaft of the steering wheel apart, greased it been fine ever since, I do this every 3 years."
781696,OhioFisherman,2013-04-23 14:14:00,6623,"Walmart and others used to sell a fitting that screwed on, just a couple of bucks and worth the price. Hit it with a shot of grease every year and no problems. I had my boat for 22 years, it got greased every year."
781704,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-23 15:02:00,10439,"Yes, if your OB doesn't have a grease fitting on the tilt tube do yourself a favour and pick up one of these. It replaces one of the nuts on the tilt tube that the cable runs through and allows you to use a grease gun to properly grease the cable and tilt tube.  http://shop.discountmarinesupply.biz/1-STEERING-GUARD-TILT-TUBE-GREASE-ADAPTER-50-28261.htm  "
