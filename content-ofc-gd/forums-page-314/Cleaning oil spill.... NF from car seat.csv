I thought I got a fair bit of it up but it has been sreading up the seat. Today I removed the offending seat and I took the covers off(oh joy).... Now I have the foam that has soaked up the oil. Anyway to get it out? I think I may just have to accept it and cover it in plastic before I put the clean sovers back on."

If it is still present then pour oil absorbing granulates (available at auto parts store) on it and let sit overnight. Final thought is to encapsulate it with clear polyurethane spray but beware it will attack certain types of foam so test on the bottom area first.   Art

782371,Entropy,2013-04-26 00:17:00,747,"Dish soap, in a Dish soap squeez bottle.  50% soap 50% boiling water.  squirt on area and scrub with stiff bristle brush ( I use one of those finger nail brush types or other larger ) then take shop vac to wet area, Repeat 10 times.  This is how I treat vomit in the car and on the couch in the house.  kids eh.  Oh, to leave a lasting fresh smell I use 50% liquid laundry fabric softner and 50% hot water, and do the same on the final 'pass'.  The exhaust coming out of your shop vac will never smell better!
