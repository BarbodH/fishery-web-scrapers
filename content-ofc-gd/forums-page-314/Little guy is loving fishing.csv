He's turning 2 in a few weeks...  I couldn't be happier to have my little guy so excited about fishing...  Got out for some perching today... Didn't get many... But we did get this piggy... Not a bad way to spend my ""family time""  "
781539,Roy,2013-04-22 23:13:00,13728,Great catch for the lad. Now put a PFD on the boy.
781541,Tayzak15,2013-04-22 23:16:00,318,nice perch!! can't wait till the water opens up here

781559,mike rousseau,2013-04-23 00:10:00,4661,Yes it is.... Lol

781702,lew,2013-04-23 14:45:00,12766,Fantastic picture Mike !!
781713,mike rousseau,2013-04-23 15:28:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  I I'm just happy he like getting out at all...  He can handle about 3 hours then he gets bored...  He's been out 4-5 times already this year...  He especially likes feeding carp... But insists on carrying the bait bucket...  
781716,fishnsled,2013-04-23 15:56:00,3520,Great shots Mike and many more to come I'm sure.
