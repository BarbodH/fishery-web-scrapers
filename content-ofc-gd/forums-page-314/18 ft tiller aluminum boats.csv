781296,fish_fishburn,2013-04-21 16:00:00,1311,"Hey Jim, I sent a email to a Crestliner dealer for a quote on a 1750 tiller with a 90hp optimax and trailer. Would of asked for the 1850 but its only rated for a 90. Same as all the other manufactures their 18 to 19 ft tillers are all rated for 90 hp only. To slow for me. Have a dealer 25 miles from me so thats nice and have dealt with them before. Will let you know how things fare out. Thanks Mike"
781414,RangerGuy,2013-04-22 11:00:00,564,We got a 2012 18' Lund Alaskan Tiller with a 75hp Yamaha Tiller.  While this boat is more utility than my 16' Ranger fisherman tiller. I am extremely pleased with it  I ran 3 adults and 2 65lb labs full gear on a 4 day weekend last year and still had 1/4 tank at the end of the weekend.  Ride is much better than expected from a aluminum boat.  Speed and time to plane is darn good. I'm on plane with that load in seconds and can easily get 37-38 mph  So glad we went with an Alaskan and a Yamaha!
781681,fish_fishburn,2013-04-23 12:56:00,1311,Anyone here own a Crestliner Pro Tiller with a 90 hp motor? If so how do you like it.
781683,fish_fishburn,2013-04-23 12:57:00,1311,Pro Tiller 1750 with a 90 to be exact.
781760,RangerGuy,2013-04-23 20:36:00,564,Have you tried Hastings marine. They have great service and were the only dealer not to soak me swapping the merc for a Yamaha.  Other dealers wanted 1200 extra to sell it with motor other than merc.  Not Hastings.. They have been very accommodating with my service as well. I am 1.5 hrs away from them so I want the boat done while I'm there so a 3 hr drive doesn't turn into a 6 hour drive for service.
781871,Sinker,2013-04-24 02:34:00,8692,"I also speak highly of hastings. They have some great deals, and their service guys are top notch!  S."
781893,lew,2013-04-24 08:50:00,12766,"I bought my  Skeeter from Hastings Marine, great folks to deal with."
781898,fishindevil,2013-04-24 10:18:00,6254,"i also bought my lund from hastings marine,and last year bought a 50hp yamaha four stroke from them to put on my lund,and they have been great to deal with over the last 6 yrs,they usually have a pretty stock of boats on site,and if not they will get you one for sure !!!! yes i would buy another boat or anything from them in the future !!!!! go with a lund and a yamaha engine,and you will set for years,and years ......just sayin"
766741,Steve,2013-02-10 18:39:00,2075,new lund seats are plastic and garbage - like much of the stuff on the new lunds.  my original lund seats (1998) were far far far better than the ones I replaced them with in 2009.
766742,Sinker,2013-02-10 18:44:00,8692,Check out the Starcraft tillers as well. They are sweeet!!  S.
766746,lew,2013-02-10 18:51:00,12766," I've had a couple over the years Shane and your right , their excellent boats."
766764,Bondar,2013-02-10 20:12:00,817,"The alumacraft is an awesome boat my Dad has it and it handles Big water no problem , it is heavy though and with a 90 tops out at like 35mph which is fine , but 45 would be better   "
766767,fish_fishburn,2013-02-10 20:41:00,1311,Nice boat Wiser. Seems like all these tillers are under powered to me. 36 to 40 mph with a 90hp. Put a 150 on the back and now were talking. I like the gunnell with the built in rails on the new Alumacraft. and I would want vinyl instead of carpets for sure.
766769,Bondar,2013-02-10 20:51:00,817,"yea the same boat in a console is rated for a 175 but the tiler only a 90  ,  I believe its because of the no Hydraulic steering on the tillers when they were rated  would be an awesome boat with  150 on it"
766770,fish_fishburn,2013-02-10 20:56:00,1311,I think power steering can be arranged.
766771,mike rousseau,2013-02-10 20:59:00,4661,My brothers 20 foot ranger tiller has a 115 (no hydraulic steering) and in rough water your fighting pretty hard with the tiller...  Anyone getting a big tiller should strongly consider hydraulic steering like Titan....
766772,fish_fishburn,2013-02-10 20:59:00,1311,I also like the Alumacraft because you can get any motor make you want for it. I'm really liking the Suzuki 90. A buddy had a 150 Suzzy on his bassboat yrs ago and it would run with 175's all day.
768633,fish_fishburn,2013-02-18 18:37:00,1311,"Well I sent out 4 emails to various boat dealers, Lund,Alumacraft and Kingfisher. Was just asking for the msrp of their boats I am interested in. Going on 10 days and no replies from any of them. Are these numbers top secret?  Any idea how long a reply takes ."
768642,trapshooter,2013-02-18 20:48:00,1234,I bet if you call a salesperson at each dealer you'll get your numbers pretty damn quick!
769056,troutologist,2013-02-20 16:10:00,951,"I ran the 1725 pro guide and loved it, I found the 1825 hull to be a little faster . Beat mine up for 3 years and nary an issue.   Even with the 90hp I never found an issue with the tiller and no hydraulic steering."
769405,cellwood,2013-02-21 23:25:00,11,Alumacraft for sure. Hands down best boat I have ever owned and the E-tec has been flawless. Go see Bay City Marine.
781006,fish_fishburn,2013-04-20 13:37:00,1311,"Hi guys, just giving you an update on my experience with the dealers I have been in contact with through emails and phone calls. Its been two months since I contacted about seven dealers in total. Not one replied to the emails I sent out so I called them all by phone. four dealers had no answer so I left a message which none of then returned. The others said they didnt have pricing yet or something to that effect, but they would get back to me as soon as they got them.  Told them I was three to four hrs away by car and if I liked what I heard I would make the drive to come and see them. As of today none have replied to my calls. Am I expecting to much from these dealers? I even sent my info to each manufacturer to send me their 2013 catalogues as required on their web sites and still havent received anything from any of them.  Been two months now.  One salesman I talked to asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was in sales. He said what do you sell and I told him what does it matter. Anyhow not having a very good experience buying a new boat so far.Think I will scratch these dealers off my list since they cant take a minute to try and sell me a boat, can only imagine what their service is like when trying to get something repaired.  I ran my own retail business for twenty years and would always treat a cold call as a possible sale. I guess things have changed, seems these sales people dont care unless you walk in with a hand full of cash and say I'll take that one."
781007,fish_fishburn,2013-04-20 13:40:00,1311,Anyone else having this type of experience?
781009,Dan668,2013-04-20 13:48:00,1120,"Maybe because of my age most dealers didn't pay attention to me. But when i came in with cash on hand, different story."
781026,Moosebunk,2013-04-20 14:57:00,3970,"I find this odd FishB as just this past couple weeks I contacted by email a Temagami and Calabogie Naden dealer, Carleton Place Marine for Lund and Rideau Ferry Marine for Alumacraft.  All returned emails that day or overnight.  All gave quotes by email except Calabogie, and upon having a look at the Alumacraft and Lund, both dealerships there had staff at my side willing to answer any questions.  I also have a tiller.  16.5 Rebel XL with a 60HP.  It has spent time on St.Clair, Quinte, Nipigon and other big waters too... sometimes a week at a time.  It's also lighter and trailers well, and launches into ditches if need be.  Not sure why some others have issues with Lund, I have had no issues with mine and although it's on the road 2-4 times a week and has been trailered several times across the province, you treat it like an investment and give it regular check-ups it'll be fine.  If thinking CPMarine & Lund... I could try Shawn on your behalf.  We went to school together.  Or, if you didn't know this, Rideau Ferry deals Alumacraft and I was there last week eyeballin' boats too.  They are the closest to you with this brand and the fella who met me at the door seemed a nice young lad."
781030,irishfield,2013-04-20 15:07:00,26272,"Yep... Fall 2006.. DT Sports, Gordon Bay Marine and Bay Marine in Hamilton. All couldn't be bothered to respond to emails asking for a quote on a 2150 Baron or 1950 Tyee..... that they wouldn't even have to put in their ""floor plan"" and see every day in their showroom. Temagami Marine was certainly happy to get their 15 to 20% profit, for a 70k+ boat, that didn't have to be 3rd party financed and sitting in their inventory!"
781052,Radnine,2013-04-20 16:13:00,1538,"If you want to see how a dealer should show boats and treat customers go to Proctor Marine in Simcoe Ontario (electronically of course). Click on ""Showroom"" and see a profile of every boat that they have, including the price. And I guarantee that Doug will return your email with any question. Now, I know that this does not help a guy in Ottawa (what does? ) but if your dealership doesn't act like this dealership, look for one that does. Jim"
781053,fish_fishburn,2013-04-20 16:21:00,1311,I went to a local Princecraft dealer 2 weeks ago to check out their boats and prices. The staff was nice and knowledgable. I gave him a list on what I wanted on my boat and am still waiting for a price. Think Ill pass on Princecraft because I wasnt impressed with the layout of their boats and they seemed not very interested in selling me what I wanted. Tried talking me into buying a console model. They had free stuff that came with the console model but no freebies on  the same model with a tiller.
781054,fish_fishburn,2013-04-20 16:22:00,1311,Thanks Jim. What do they sell?
781062,Luke V.,2013-04-20 17:04:00,286,Proctor Marine gets my vote as well Talk to Doug great salesman willing to help at all costs Kept my boat for a week to make it get on plane better He even took it out on the lake twice to ensure it was just right. (No cost to me)  They are carrying crestliner boats. Which are awesome Back when we bought our boat he was selling starcrafts I would definitely be calling him!
781065,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-20 17:43:00,4399,"Being in sales for 35 years I understand a thing or two about customer service and I find it appalling that the dealers/salespeople treated a potential client with such disregard,  in a competative business it's your customer service that sets you apart.  When I was looking I found the  sales service okay the real disappointment was the amount of inventory they keep, always little or no inventory and 3 month leadtime. It was the complete opposite when I bought my trailer great service and lots of inventory to touch and feel. The boat guys could learn a thing or two from the RV guys!!!"
781069,kickingfrog,2013-04-20 17:57:00,8333,"I hear ya about the inventory on hand. I understand, floor space, overhead etc but if an rv dealer can do it, as you point out, why not a boat dealer? The boat shows/ fishing shows are great places to compare and contrast different brands."
781104,Radnine,2013-04-20 20:12:00,1538, They sell the greatest boats ever made....Crestliner! You would be looking for the 1850 Pro Tiller (unless you come to your senses and buy a side console). Good luck! Jim
766230,fish_fishburn,2013-02-08 16:22:00,1311,"Hey guys, I am thinking of buying an 18 ft tiller boat, motor, trailer package but am not sure what is available. I have sent a few emails to Lund dealers in the Ottawa area but havent heard back from them yet.  What other manufactures make boats in the cofiguration?  I definitely want aluminum since I river fish mostly with alot of rock and sand shorelines. I have had glass bassboats for the last 20 years and dont fish to many tournaments anymore and am thinking this type of boat would suit me fine.  I would sacrafice a wheel for the extra fishing space any day of the week and am thinking the 90 hp would be the ticket since I do a fair amount of travel to my fishing spots. Can a kicker be put on these as well? Since I find myself doing more trolling in the last few years with good success. Hydraulic steering is a must since I can imagine the steering torque on a tiller of this size.  I'm not interested in Princecraft, there pretty but thats about all as far as I am concerned.  What I would want is something completely wired for electronics and engine guages, no carpets I'm done with that vinyl floor is prefered. Rod locker to store lots of rods up to 8 ft. Lots of dry storage, 24 volt minimum and most important a dry ride while running in rough water. Thanks in advance Mike."
766235,Raf,2013-02-08 16:35:00,3495,Lund Alaskan immediately comes to mind -- I'm sure you've already got that covered.  Good luck in your search and I'd be interested in your findings.  I'm a tiller guy as well and an 18ft tiller w/a 90 would be a sweet sweet rig.
766241,Gerritt,2013-02-08 16:46:00,6129,Spiel's boat comes to mind... he purchased his from Bay City marine. Bit of a hike from ottawa though lol
766246,Reelaction,2013-02-08 16:58:00,33,"I've had a Lund Pro Guide 16 with an 80 horse Yami for 11 years. Great boat with an awsome layout. The torque on the motor isn't nearly as much as one would think. On plane, i can easily stear with two fingers. Power trim is a must. I have a trim button on the floor that is very easy to operate.  Good luck on your search"
766271,Roy,2013-02-08 18:17:00,13728,"I really like the Pro Guide....Max HP on the 1825 is 90HP. Look at the 2010 pro guide....with a 200HP tiller! WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!  For the time being though, I'm very happy with the Princecraft 167BT with a 60HP 4 stroke. and 70lb 24V Minn Kota. It's all I need."
766290,linweir,2013-02-08 19:24:00,202,"I own Lund Alaskan 1600 Tiller, which is great fishing boat on med/small lakes. This type of boat is not wide but speed is good.  You can also consider G3 boat. It's similar as lund but price is good."
766296,trapshooter,2013-02-08 19:38:00,1234,"This is the same as my boat and I love it.  18.5' Alumacraft tiller with a 90hp Yammy.  After running many different big tillers, Alumacraft has been the best of the bunch.  Also worth looking at is the new 18' Kingfisher Trio Tiller.   "
766297,fish_fishburn,2013-02-08 19:39:00,1311,"I will look at the G3 as well. I have only heard good things about their boats. Are they all powered with yammys? That 200 sounds like a beast Roy, but I already have a V6 parked in the garage and the fuel costs are pretty sic. Thinking a 90 is a V4? I am starting to realize this isnt as popular a style of boat as I thought they were. Alot of manufactures dont make boats this size in a tiller cofiguration."
766299,fish_fishburn,2013-02-08 19:41:00,1311,Thanks Ben will check en out.

766301,kickingfrog,2013-02-08 19:52:00,8333,I was going to comment about Ben's boat but he beat me to it.

766318,fish_fishburn,2013-02-08 20:43:00,1311,I just checked out the 185 tiller with the 90. An ultimate fishing machine if I do say so.

766666,fish_fishburn,2013-02-10 12:52:00,1311,"Hey Ben, I like the Kingfisher line as well. I think the 1725 Flex is more practical for what I want. The 1825 Trio is nice but the rod storage is lacking. These boats are built tough for sure. A 4.0 mm hull thickness is a nice touch. The flex is only 2 inches shorter then the Trio but has a 8ft beam and is rated for a 90 hp max and has lots of rod storage. definitely going to look into them a bit more. any idea on the price? I am going to email for a quote. The closest dealer to me is Sudbury, that kind of sucks. Im not to worried about resale because my next boat will be my last....I think. Still contemplating the others, Lund and Alumacraft as well. I have read quite a bit about Lund having crappy seats, that break. Have they sorted this problem out yet?"
766679,trapshooter,2013-02-10 14:45:00,1234,"In my experiences the seats are the least of your concerns in a L*%D.  I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of that brand.  Haven't seen pricing for the 1725 flex either.  PM me your email address."
766723,BillM,2013-02-10 17:34:00,17367,Alumacraft should be another brand you check out.  They make some awesome boats.
766739,Roy,2013-02-10 18:32:00,13728,"You should have read the whole thread, Bill."
766740,BillM,2013-02-10 18:34:00,17367, Whoops!     Looks like Ben took care of that angle!
