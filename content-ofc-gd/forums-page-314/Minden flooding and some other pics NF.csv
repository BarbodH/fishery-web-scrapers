781456,chris.brock,2013-04-22 16:18:00,4053,"The rain caused a sink hole in my driveway which I promptly got stuck in, right up to the axle. The shovel was futile. I had to get a neighbor to pop me out.     A deer browsing on some of the new growth, taken right off my front deck.     I felt bad for the people of Minden, especially with idiots like me taking pics. I would have volunteered to help but there was nothing to do. I didn't see it, but the hydro dam up river, holding back Minden Lk, was getting over-run with water coming over and around it. There was some worry it might let go.    the beer store, still open, but with water in the back         I put a marker stick in the sand on Gull Lk. The water rose 5"" overnight from Sunday to Monday "
781457,NAW,2013-04-22 16:20:00,4022,Looks like you got her burried pretty good.  How long did that take to get out?  Thanks for the pics!
781458,chris.brock,2013-04-22 16:23:00,4053, friend with a truck and chain and it popped right out
781464,bigugli,2013-04-22 16:31:00,6138,It has always been a risk with the Gull R.  Most of the homes there were built long before we had 50 year and 100 year flood plans.
781467,NAW,2013-04-22 16:36:00,4022,"I just noticed..  First pic..  Truck stuck...  4th pick, Truck at beer store!"

781471,Gerritt,2013-04-22 17:05:00,6129,"Insane and from 01/01/06, someone needs to buy a newer camera.... and a rear window for the Ford LOL"
781476,irishfield,2013-04-22 17:40:00,26272,Long as the beer store is open Chris.. the town will be fine! ;O)
781477,chris.brock,2013-04-22 17:40:00,4053,"  Friends don't let friends drive Rangers  I guess we're not friends then, LOL  I have a newer camera, but I like the old Kodak better, it's bullet proof"
781485,Gerritt,2013-04-22 18:17:00,6129,Rangers..... boats!
781486,Acountdeleted,2013-04-22 18:41:00,2562,"Did you happen to go through Norland on your way up? My parents have a cottage 15 minutes or so from there, just curious how it was there."
781493,chris.brock,2013-04-22 19:54:00,4053, The Gull River was super high down there too.
781507,turtle,2013-04-22 21:11:00,274,Thanks for the update.  I found out today I'll be walking and doing some climbing up and down a 30 foot long washout to get into the cottage this weekend. I don't mind the exercise but the potential dollar signs are disburbing.
781884,Toad Hunter,2013-04-24 06:10:00,261,my brother was showing me some pics today (as we have a trailer off of 121) but can't seem to find the icon for adding a picture ?
781932,mirogak,2013-04-24 13:50:00,387,Thx for the update and for being our eyes up there.
781949,cityfisher,2013-04-24 15:04:00,959,WoW what a mess... Ill be in the area on the weekend. hopefully it receeeds soon.  All the area lakes clear of ice? thinking of laker hunting soon
781952,pics,2013-04-24 15:26:00,1268,I'd love to see what 3 brothers falls in Kinmount looks like. Might be more like one big set of rapids....
781955,ecmilley,2013-04-24 15:36:00,2163,"mess for sure up there. one thing i have noticed with all the bancroft/hali/minden pics is it seems the beer and lcbo's are built on the high ground, now that's good planning"
781956,Toad Hunter,2013-04-24 15:56:00,261,it also seems every photographer seems concerned about the beer store and LCBO lol. (must just be a staple land mark that everyone knows)
781957,chris.brock,2013-04-24 16:10:00,4053,"  no problem Mirro   there was some decent sattelite pictures yesterday, looks like the lakes are pretty well ice free   if the beer store flooded out, then it would really be a disaster!"
781959,woodenboater,2013-04-24 16:23:00,2277," nah, just grab the tinnies as they float out the door lol"
