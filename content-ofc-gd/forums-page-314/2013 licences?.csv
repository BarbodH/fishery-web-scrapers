780175,Bill Shearer,2013-04-16 19:11:00,456,Ahhh freedom 65!
780185,salmon,2013-04-16 19:41:00,334,Renewed mine on line and 1 1/2 weeks after got the card
780220,Ralph Field,2013-04-16 23:30:00,1018,"A small perk ,but still a nice perk for us old farts."
780226,danc,2013-04-17 00:37:00,4677,"This entire outdoors card thing is ridiculous. An outdoors card is a licence to buy a licence. It causes more confusion than anything. If it was meant to be a cash grab, I'd rather just pay more for my licence in the first place."
780337,redwings24,2013-04-17 15:16:00,15,"Dan,  I'm glad that I checked my card before going out this Saturday to the perch festival in Orillia, I was expired, but got it renewed.   Check with MNR and they will not send out any notifications any more.  They say its to save money."
780441,icedude,2013-04-17 23:07:00,459,Welcome Aboard !   Thrilled to learn you are not 'Expired' any longer  Have FUN with the Perch--Good Luck on a WIN  ID1
780630,snagged,2013-04-18 21:21:00,67,After reading this thread I wasn't expecting my card to come for awhile but to my surprise it arrived today. I purchased it a week ago.
781985,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-24 17:58:00,4399,"Ordered mine last Tuesday got the card in the mail yesterday, not bad service."
782002,redwings24,2013-04-24 19:21:00,15,"Dame, just got mine in the mail yesterday.  That was fast."
782011,SirWhite,2013-04-24 19:42:00,210,Yeah it seems very redundant like our money is getting soaked up in administration and not conservation
782337,Canadian1995,2013-04-25 22:56:00,14,i dont need a license because im 17. haha!
767555,Woodsman,2013-02-13 16:56:00,1286,Not sure suggesting is a good word more like telling. Online not the easiest now is it?
767565,Woodsman,2013-02-13 17:12:00,1286,Did you buy that card & tag at a privatew retailer instead of directly at the Ministry? Under the old system the retailer had to mail in the paperwork to the Ministry where they would hand enter it into the computer system. Problem was some retailers did not mail them in promptly if at all so no records were in the system. Some could also be misplaced in the mail or at the Ministry. I believe even if it was purchaced at a Ministry office it still had to be transfered to a centeral location for entering in the computer system. Under the current system the info is entered into the system at point of purchace. Last year mine took about 4 weeks to arrive & I also purchaced the 3 year fishing tag at the same time so I won't have to carry any extra slips for the duration of the card. There was some glitches starting up the new system which are hopefully worked out now. Two of the biggest problems were getting the new machines out to the retailers and training on the use of the machines. Also problems recognizing some addresses.
767595,BucktownAngler,2013-02-13 20:41:00,582,cant beat canadian tire for them  get it on the spot. no issues no delays
767812,206,2013-02-14 17:32:00,563,Bought online 23of Jan. and it arrived today....guess i'm a lucky one.  I do miss the nice fish art already though....new card kinda cheezey looking
767815,irishfield,2013-02-14 17:39:00,26272,Funny.. my new 3 year card has that ugly Musky food picture on it!
767821,BillM,2013-02-14 18:14:00,17367,I've got a big fat turkey on mine.
767830,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 18:34:00,8333,Yours came with your picture on it Bill? Must be special.
767844,BillM,2013-02-14 19:21:00,17367, I used the 'personalize' option on the MNR website!  LOL!
767882,kickingfrog,2013-02-14 22:25:00,8333,"Glad you saw it as it was intended, I can't use the emoticons on my phone."
767894,GreenCanada,2013-02-14 23:28:00,375,Just got my new one in the mail today. Bought it last Thursday.
767896,MCTFisher9120,2013-02-14 23:31:00,3761,Funky blue card came in today
767898,kemper,2013-02-14 23:38:00,2232,Well I guess I'll have to start calling around and see what's up. Or photocopy the paper one a thousand times and put each one in a baggy in something that I take fishing...
767967,Woodsman,2013-02-15 05:22:00,1286,kemper did you just buy a fishing license or an Outdoors Card at the same time? If no Outdoors card was bought (already had a valid one) carrying you computer printout is how the system works. No sticker will be mailed. If you bought a card at the same time it should be mailed out inprinted with the licenses you bought.
767971,kemper,2013-02-15 05:50:00,2232," My card needed renewal too.  Last time I renewed online I got a yellow paper tag in the mail, you are saying they are expecting us to carry the actual computer printout around all year? I can't imagine that's the case..."
768041,Woodsman,2013-02-15 15:58:00,1286,If you renewed your card at the same time it should be mailed out to you inprinted with the license you bought on the back.
768043,MCTFisher9120,2013-02-15 16:03:00,3761,"Hope you got the 3 year license when your card expired. Other wise your safe for this year but the following two you need to tuck in the yellow slip into your wallet with your card. No brainer, your saving money this way paying the current price x3 rather than paying a extra 2 or 3 bucks every year as the license price jumps up slightly."
768044,decamo,2013-02-15 16:12:00,9,"Renewed mine in January, shocked that I got it 14 days later"
768058,JoshS,2013-02-15 17:51:00,729,"Renewed mine end of the year and I as well was surprised to get it in the mail around two weeks later. Give them a call, however don't think the printouts have expiry dates?"
779877,brig,2013-04-15 16:19:00,1,I could not find a straight answer anywere... Would showing an electronic copy of the fishing license on smart phone be acceptable or we have to carry the printout? I hope that e-license definition actually makes sence in this case.
779879,Gerritt,2013-04-15 16:47:00,6129,"Thanks for bringing this up.. I too never received mine when I applied in early January, all I have was the yellow papers they gave me.. I just gave them a call and my card will be mailed out.  G"
780051,hotsky,2013-04-16 01:37:00,400,I renewed before the new years and still nothing in the mail. :/
780105,Rich,2013-04-16 10:17:00,3927,"If you order the 3 year online you just get a card, no annoying extra slip to carry with it. At least I did. Boy are they ever plain looking cards lol"
780124,FISHEYEZ,2013-04-16 13:35:00,49,"Arent they only using the yellow ""paper"" cards? When I renewed mine they told me I would not recieve a plastic card in the mail."
780140,Woodsman,2013-04-16 15:14:00,1286,If you only renewed your fishing license (old Outdoors Card still valid) than the yellow paper card is all you'll get. If you got a new Outdoors Card it will be a plastic card mailed out to you.
780143,misfish,2013-04-16 15:32:00,29133, yup yup yup
767022,kemper,2013-02-11 21:59:00,2232,"I'm still waiting for my 2013 licence. Renewed in December, and I've been carrying the print out ever since.  I understand that it's expired, but I would fight any charge based on the fact that they haven't sent me the dang thing yet.  Anyone else in the same boat?  I guess I'll start annoying someone at the MNR now."
767025,porkpie,2013-02-11 22:05:00,2521,I would definately look into it!  I had my renewed 3 year card within a couple of weeks!
767027,jedimaster,2013-02-11 22:09:00,3472,"Mine took over a month to get, I called in and they had the wrong address. Give them a call."
767030,misfish,2013-02-11 22:15:00,29133,"Come to thnk of it,I havent got mine as well. I have the print off,plus my credit card payment. I will fight as well.If it came to that But I dought any normal MNR human being would push it."
767039,bigugli,2013-02-11 22:44:00,6138,My son still has not got his yet. 6 weeks later
767049,BucktownAngler,2013-02-11 23:02:00,582,"i just get mine at canadian tire.   not to hijack, but i was checked by MNR at simcoe coming off the lake a couple weeks ago. (no fish in my possession)  Not that i mind, because i had it on me.....but if i forgot it, could he have done anything? i wasnt fishing at the time, and had no fish in my possession"
767068,kickingfrog,2013-02-11 23:47:00,8333,Mine expires this December 31stâ€¦ maybe I should start now.
767069,kickingfrog,2013-02-11 23:48:00,8333,"If you had fishing gear with you, you might have some explaining to do."
767077,BillM,2013-02-12 00:11:00,17367," Sure, he could have charged you with not having your license while you were fishing..."
767078,MCTFisher9120,2013-02-12 00:15:00,3761,Same with me :S
767085,hotsky,2013-02-12 00:28:00,400,Renewed last week of December and nothing yet..
767170,Joeytier,2013-02-12 02:17:00,3990,I bought my 2013 license and got my yellow card.  My outdoors card was expired and am still waiting for it to come in the mail...it's been at least 5 weeks now.  I've been checked for my license twice now and the yellow card was sufficient [obviously].
767175,irishfield,2013-02-12 02:42:00,26272,Renewed in December.. got card in early January. eazy peazy.. give'm a call to see where yours is. I shreaded my printouts but I don't remember an expiry date on them...
767179,John Bacon,2013-02-12 02:45:00,3277," Convictions are based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  If you are coming off the lake with fishing equipment, then what are the chances that you had not been fishing?  You might have a chance if were driving a sled with a passenger who did have a license; then you could say you only drove out there to pick your friend up.  It really comes down to what the CO and the judge believe."
767181,BillM,2013-02-12 02:47:00,17367,"CO can easily look your name up in the system as well..  Most guys aren't going to ticket you because you don't have the license on you (I've been checked a few times without my card, they took my name/info never an issue)"
767182,registerfly,2013-02-12 02:49:00,198,"don't worry guys. I haven't received mine either and I renewed 2nd week in Jan. Had a CO visit my hut this past weekend and showed him the paper receipt and he was fine, almost expected it.  come and gone in 30 sec."
767187,highdrifter,2013-02-12 02:51:00,2534,Ordered mine online on the 15th of january.  Called in last Friday and I was told I'd have it in 3 weeks.  Trouble is I don't have the print out and they can't send it to you again..  So technically I've been fishing without a licence.  I was told that I could get fined for fishing without one and the person on the phone recommended I make my way to Queens Park and pay the $10.50 for a temporary one.  Nuts to that!!  Still waiting...  Going to have to bite it and get the temporary for our upcoming trip to Cochrane..  Am I the only one or does this sound totally bogus?!
767189,John Bacon,2013-02-12 02:53:00,3277, I think it has been rectified now; but at one point the fine for forgetting to bring your licence was higher than the fine for not having a licence at all.  I do recall a story on this board about someone having their equipment confiscated because they had forgot to bring their licence with them.  I that is rediculous for such a minor offence; but they can do it.
767190,kemper,2013-02-12 02:53:00,2232,"Sounds like crap to me.  I'm sure the system is kinda buggered because it's new, but it should be pretty simple if you ask me."
767228,Rich,2013-02-12 12:33:00,3927,"Renewed online late dec, still carrying the printout in a ziploc baggy. I've had friends who waited up to 4 months before receiving their card. This is the longest I've ever personally waited."
767437,boombap,2013-02-13 01:46:00,310,"I renewed mine online last year January and never received it.  It's time to renew again, ill be doing it at crappy tire or bps this time."
767486,Woodsman,2013-02-13 05:08:00,1286,If your just getting a one year license & not an Outdoors Card at the same time you will not get a stricker no matter where you buy it. You have to carry the print out for the year. A yellow tag from a license issuer or a computer printout if you do it on line.
767488,kemper,2013-02-13 05:19:00,2232," Wait a minute, are you suggesting that I have to carry my printed piece of 8 1/2 by 11 around with me in a ziplock all year?"
767489,icedude,2013-02-13 05:22:00,459,  Funny Stuff !      Might be an idea worth exploring...for you  You have a reasonable time horizon here   Can't Catch Fish   on the internet KF   Renew a licence--perhaps   Good Luck with it all Buck   ID1
767513,azebra,2013-02-13 13:53:00,168,"Afew years ago I bought the sport tag and card.. had the print off for about 9 months, I still didnt recieve my card.. hours of phone calls and bickering later, I was told they had zero record of my name buying an outdoors card and tag. so I had to spent the money and get a conservation tag and card all over again, this time I got it in about 6 weeks. stupid MNR next year Ill have to renew my card I hope I wont have to do that song and dance again.."
