Tried various searches but came up with very little. My guess would be lake trout and smallmouth but if any of you could confirm that would be great.  Stuart"

From what I can find, Emsdale is Lakers and Smallies.....stopped stocking lakers over ten years ago as it appeared they were reproducing naturally.  Can't find anyhing on Fisher, but would highly recommend calling the local MNR office up there and ask to talk to the biologist....they are super helpful.  May or may not know anything about the lake, but worth a call IMO."
