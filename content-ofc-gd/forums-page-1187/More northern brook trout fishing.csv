90246,Guidofisherman,2007-07-03 10:50:00,206,I've been back to the Nipigon a few more times and the fishing has improved from the drought conditions we had in the spring. The river and lake levels are getting close to normal and the Nipigon water temperature is in the low 50's. Here are a few photos with all fish tagged and released. I took one of the young guys from the fly tying club to catch his first Nipigon Brookie and he outfished me. I guess that's the last time he goes! Alan

I'll drop that report off in your mailbox this weekend on my way to the Neebing. Promise. I haven't forgotten about it."

Yes, Dan...that's what retirement is all about...fishing...right after I've done the dishes, cut the lawn and cleaned the floors. By the way, ""I have a head ache tonight!"". I'll look forward to that report. Alan "
