He has not done the river before,but after reading and hearing about yesturdays adventure,he wanted to try it.So were on the water by 5:30 this morning,only got a few hours to fish. I decide to try new areas and stay away from where Terry and I caught yesturday.So we head alittle futher down the river and start fish,n. Ryan hooks up with the same set up as Terry did yesturday,but went with a diiferent colour and bigger hook.  . I had to rig up a new jig,so I went with blue jig with the blue/lime Craw. Were only into it for 5 minutes and ryans boats the fisrt one. Cool he says,this is wild.LOL Alittle ways down,fish on,nope not me but him again.Ok Im getting behind all ready. Fish a good lenght for an houe and land 3 small fish.Yep him again.Son 5 dad 0.  Ok now it,s time to get the game face on and low and behold,dont he boat another.Sheech. Not to worry though my turn did come and I put the boy in his place,well that was until he boated a bigger one.  Well in 4 hours we boated 9 fish,two were real nice fish others were 2 pounders+. I did give that spot a try again Terry to see if that brute was there,but must of been still sleeping.LOL   Heres some pics from this mornings outing.        The pig of the morning,caught by who else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  "
