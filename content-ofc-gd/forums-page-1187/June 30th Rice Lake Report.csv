89762,Steelcat,2007-07-01 00:58:00,191,"Today the weather was lovely in the morning.  Calm wind and the temperature was perfect.   We got our rental boat at around 830am, then immediately head out to find some weedbed.  After driving for around 10 to 15 minutes, we came upon a good looking weedbed.  Right away we start dropping our senko, jig/grub into the holes (we were using slow presentation).  Within 2 minutes, my dad caught a nice 17.5 inches Largemouth.  Almost immediately after that I caught 5 more Largemouth, but they were all dings (10 to 13 inches).  My brother also caught a nice ""length"" one around 16 inches, but it was so skinny that it looks like a boomerang.  As we were drifting, my line suddenly moved sideway, so I set the hook~ It was heavy~!!  It fought like a bull, when we landed it, it was a massive 18.5 inches Largemouth~!  After this bucketmouth, I was able to catch several more 17 to 18 inches.  During the whole morning (before 10am), we managed to catch Largemouth after Largemouth, we also caught two ding Smallmouth, several Rock Bass, one Crappie, several Perch.  After 1030am, the bite kind of shut down.  We did caught several Bass from time to time, but nothing close to those we caught during the morning.  At around 2pm, the weather started to turn bad.  The sky was turning Gray, then you could see a blanket of rain moving across the lake.  At first we were thinking of braving the rain and keep fishing, but then I felt some static when my finger touched my fishing rod, not long after that we heard a loud thunder.  So we immediately head to shore, found a resort with docks, we docked our boat and ran into one of the empty hut to avoid the lightning.  After we were safe, we looked out and saw a lightning strike at the place where we were planning to go (now that's more lucky than getting a jackpot~!).  After that wave of storm passed, we immediately head back to our boat rental.  On our way, we hit another wave of heavy rain.  We always brought our rain coat  even when it's sunny, but we forgot to bring our rain pants.  So our jeans as well as our underwear were all soaked.   Overall, we managed to catch 30 Bass all in 7 to 10 feet of water.  SLOW presentation.  17.5 inches Largemouth  18 inches Largemouth  Some dings   Some Smallmouth   Rock Bass, Crappie, and Perch in the mix    The largest fish of the day~ 18.5 inches  NEVER TRUST THE WEATHER CHANNEL~! It's suppose to be sunny all day and no mention of any storm or rain.  "

Called for a sunny day with west winds, we had little sun and north west winds really kicked in after the storm.  Thanks for the Rice lake report.  ehg"
