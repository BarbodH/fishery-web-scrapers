90088,lew,2007-07-02 20:24:00,12767,"My daughter & I went lookin for muskies on Stoney Lake yesterday and I was trolling a 13"" Believer in 25 FOW @ 5 MPH and I saw a hump coming up to 7' on the GPS screen, so I  told Sheri to get ready cause muskies luv to hang out around humps, and I no sooner said it and WHAM....the big girl hit right on cue  !!!!!  I grabbed the rod outta the holder, turned to the back of the boat and a big fat 50""er comes flying outta the water 30' behind the boat, does a tail walk and spits the bait right back at me........DANG    Doncha just hate  when that happens  ......."
90089,ccmtcanada,2007-07-02 20:40:00,7971,Oh man Lew...get's the heart rate right up there!!!
90095,motv8tr,2007-07-02 21:12:00,2587,Dang that's a drag!  I would hate when that happens ... if I ever had a Muskie on my line  Maureen
90097,Rich Clemens,2007-07-02 21:15:00,3131,I'd probably be laying on the bottom of the boat crying (after many choice words).   Knowing you Lew ... you'll go back and get her the next time.
90098,Smokey,2007-07-02 21:16:00,1278,"Frustrating, but nice to know there hanging out there. Must be alot nicer having the lowrance onboard to get a better feel for the water.  Better luck next time bud."
90100,danc,2007-07-02 21:17:00,4677,"Well, you know where he lives now Lew. I'd be shaking in my boots if I was that Musky."
90113,Rich,2007-07-02 23:01:00,3927,It's a lot worse when it DOESNT happen! (as in nothing hits at all)
90115,hydro,2007-07-02 23:13:00,24,The fish sure were lure spitters this weekend!
90128,Handlebarz,2007-07-02 23:33:00,3790,Lew ya gotta lear the hooking program with them Beleivers well atleast this one stayed together.
90129,John,2007-07-02 23:38:00,2956,Go get her next time Lew....
90130,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-02 23:40:00,2585,that must have been pretty exciting!  Cheers!
90136,Dutch,2007-07-03 00:12:00,831,"If that had ever happened to me, yes I think I would despise it immensely."
90147,Rizzo,2007-07-03 00:31:00,4754,"Man that's too bad but I'd still call that a successful day! (shows how easy I am to please) Those big ones are a pain in the butt to land and unhook is how I look at it, I'm just happy to see them.   p.s. shallow eye or deep eye?"
90162,Beans,2007-07-03 01:01:00,3339,YAHOO !!!!!...Hang in there Lew...I'm sure you'll get her next time...her days are numbered now that you are on her trail...
90231,solopaddler,2007-07-03 08:52:00,8605,"Can't honestly say that I hate it when that happens 'cause I've never had a 50"" Musky spit my lure 30' behind the boat Sounds heart stopping!"

90261,bigbuck,2007-07-03 12:02:00,2449,"You've got his name, number and address Lew, I think you'll be back up there at some point and will nail him."
90266,lew,2007-07-03 12:04:00,12767,"Sheri's the one that was really disappointed, cause I was just about to pass the fish'n pole  to her when the big girl said ""see ya later""  Oh well, we'll get her next time......"
90354,Mike the Pike,2007-07-03 15:26:00,3421,Wow Lew I would have paid to see that.Too bad Sheri missed out .Better luck next time .You should keep a video camera at the stern filming so we can see a hit next time.Good Luck on your next adventure.  MTP
90366,fishnsled,2007-07-03 16:25:00,3520,"Ya win some, ya lose some.  At least you got an address for the her.  Good luck next time."
