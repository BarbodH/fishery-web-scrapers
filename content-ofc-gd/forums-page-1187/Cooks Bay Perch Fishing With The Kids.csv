I was just wondering what type of water depths should I concentrate on for best results. Plus I think I am going to launch out of Cooks Bay Marina, I was wondering if there is anywhere to grab minnows nearby. Or if anybody can recommend another good launch with bait nearby, other than the beach launch at the end of 89 I believe. I have a 5 and 2 year old with me so I don't mind paying for a launch with a decent dock and parking. Thanks."
