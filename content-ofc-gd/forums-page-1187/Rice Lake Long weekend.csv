90080,Blake,2007-07-02 19:02:00,418,Went out with my dad for a few hours on the weekend to get into some bass.  Weather was seaonally cold and also very windy with winds from the north west.  The ideal area for the smallies seem to be hanging out on weed rock transitions from 7 - 12 feet of water.  Largies were on deeper weed lines.   Phenix tubes and grubs in darker colours were the hottest baits on the weekend by far.  They were fished on Shimano Crucial spinning rods spooled with 10lb Fins PRT on a Shimano 2500 Stradic with a 7ft floro lead of Gama florocarbon.  The tubes and grubs had to be fished slowly and deliberately with short hops and pauses.  I used the cylinder style tube jig heads at 1/4 and 5/16oz tube jig heads. We did not get into any huge fish but we did catch alot in the 2 - 3lb range.  Here are some pics from the weekend:
