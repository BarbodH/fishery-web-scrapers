89656,mattyk,2007-06-30 18:52:00,2110,"Out fishing Balsam Lake for musky today an caught several nice largemouth on big spinner baits. Then i get one on and think its a musky, but to my surprise its a pike (and yes i can tell the difference betwen a pike and a musky).  It was about 26-28 inches. I hate to see the pike spreading into balsam.    "

89925,ehg,2007-07-01 23:20:00,2666,The MNR is thinking of stocking the Kawarthas with Georgian Bay strain muskies to possibly co-exist with the encroachment of pike.  It would be nice to see the pike pic if possible anyways.  Welcome back to Ontario!  ehg
89974,mattyk,2007-07-02 02:58:00,2110,I put the picutre of the pike up.
90114,Dutch,2007-07-02 23:05:00,831,Hmmm - Pike not good for the Kawarthas.  Opinion only.  Can someone post a link or something to the MNR talk about stocking pike?  I find that troubling.
90158,Rizzo,2007-07-03 00:50:00,4754,"We've got relatives with a place on Balsam.  They told us already a couple of years ago there were pike in there, but now I've seen the photographic evidence.  Here's hoping you kept it!"
90187,Skud,2007-07-03 02:12:00,739,I seen some video footage of the dead carp in lake scugog and it showed a dead pike on shore too.
90201,mattyk,2007-07-03 03:03:00,2110,"yup i kept the pike, because it doesnt belong in balsam."
90206,Sinker,2007-07-03 03:32:00,8692,Atta boy!
90214,Mike the Pike,2007-07-03 05:10:00,3421,Matty good to see you back home.  MTP
