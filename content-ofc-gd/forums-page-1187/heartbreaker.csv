90139,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-03 00:19:00,1351,"so today went over to centre island with a few friends for some fishing;. right off the bat, i got a huge fish, made a huge splash, was 30+inch pike for sure.. as i was reeling it and tried to get my lip grip from my back pack, it got off! i reel in my line and found out that it broke the bait and not the line.. was using a  booyah spinner.  second fish after 30 mins of casting was another pike 25inch+ using my clown xrap. i casted it a few times and saw it follow, so i casted it again and took it this time! great fish on! NOT! it inhaled it, broke my 20lb powerpro,  i lost my xrap  third fish lost was a massive bowfin, took the blade dancer but spat it out..  so pics for today kids sorry. nothing for team 3 either.  although my friends caught a few nice 17"" LM bass."
90143,Rizzo,2007-07-03 00:28:00,4754,"Sounds like a tough day!  Were you using a leader on the second one that ""got away""?  A pike will cut through 20lb powerpro like a hot knife through butter"
90165,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-03 01:10:00,1351,"no leader.. im so mad... i shouldve brought some.. i only took one box today, thinking, ""go light"" so i totally forgot... oh well.. next time lesson learned.,"
90177,Rizzo,2007-07-03 01:41:00,4754,"Leaders...don't leave home without them!  At least you know where the fish are, get them next time"
90182,mepps,2007-07-03 01:51:00,1301,"At least you saw some action -  I used to only use leaders with specific lures when pike fishing, but I use them all teh time now - just avoid what happened to you!"
90311,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 13:49:00,7971,"Wow...I've had days like that as well, so I know your pain!!  The only thing worse is no action at all!!!  You'll get em next time!"
90324,BFSC Kevin,2007-07-03 14:16:00,1351,"although it may seem childish, but i'm not going to get over this!!! ahh... lost my baits($15), lost the fish(priceless), loss my hope(well not really.. i'll be back.. haha), but more importantly, the fish has the bait stuck in their mouths... who knows what will happen to the fish.."
90327,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 14:19:00,7971," LOL Kevin...what my latest report didn't mention is that I lost 2 crank baits and a spoon on Saturday night. As far as the fish are concerned, they'll probably do fine.  The hooks will eventually rust and fall out. or they'll just get worked out by themselves.  I've seen lots of dead fish wash ashore, but I've never seen one with a lure in it's mouth."
90359,Golfisher,2007-07-03 15:33:00,586,This reminds of that hog I lost yesterday... misery loves company!
90363,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-03 16:14:00,0,"I agree with the rest of the guys. Some action is better than no action. You still got some hits, fought some fish and came away with a great fishing story!"
90364,tbayboy,2007-07-03 16:15:00,1497,"Well at least you had some excitement Kevin, thats good for something right (I spent 5 hours at the spit Sunday and didn't get a wiff).  You'll get 'em next time."
90472,Rizzo,2007-07-03 21:11:00,4754,Unless its pinning the fishes mouth closed it will probably be alright.  I've caught a couple of pike with lures/hooks stuck in their yap that appeared to have been there a while
