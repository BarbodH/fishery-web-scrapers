He asked me some questions, and I'm going to see what I can find out, but I thought I'd post it here too.  Here is his e-mail to me:  --------------------------------- Also, if you have some spare time and want to help me research a question I have on bluegills. I am noticing a lot of gills and wonder if I should be removing some of them. - How many bluegills should be in a half acre pond? - Depending on the answer to number one, are their size limit ratios for the gills? So many big ones, versus small and how this relates to bass size. If they are all small, the bass will have food. If they are big, then they may compete for food, right? ----------------------------------------  I found some good info from the Indiana DNR website, and I'm sure there are 100's others when I go to Google...but if you have any of that first hand knowledge, let me know.  Thanks for any input! dk"
