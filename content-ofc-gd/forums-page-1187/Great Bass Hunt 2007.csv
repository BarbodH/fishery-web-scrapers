Fished all 8 days for the first time ever ... normally the wind takes a few days of fishing ... first 2 days was the best for myself ... managed to get just under 13 lbs for top 3 fish but not even close to the over 15 lbs for 3 fish that the winner had ... ... couldnt get anything bigger the rest of the week but my son did manage to get a 4.29 lbr on the last Sat and got 3rd for the kids prize ... kept a few fish over the week for lunch and they still had eggs in them ... everything seems to be late this year ... the big ones are still waiting to be caught ... got most of them on smoke color tubes with either a little purple or red in them .. gonna get out next weekend and try to get a 5 lbr ( and a fish over 19"" for team 1)      "
