89948,Joey,2007-07-02 01:58:00,9122,"Well all I can say is this is one of the most enjoyable holidays I have ever had.  The weather was nice, the fishing was great and the company was delightful.  We arrived around 10 p.m. Friday night and everyone gathered to help us set up camp amongst the nasty swarming mosquitoes.  But the joint effort got things done pretty quick.  We had a great Friday night get together around the campfire, which GCD laboured over all night keeping us warm.  Great job G            Saturday was the pike tournament and everyone got ready and headed out and we all know the outcome.  Congrats to Rick O'Banion for kicking some pike butt and to Muskystudd for catching the biggest fish (and he's on Team 2 woohoo )                  The awards ceremony and fish fry were great and we all ate to satisfaction.  Thanks TJ for the superb filetting job on those fish.  And thanks to Bite Me (Peter) for making that fantastic venison stew.  We'll have to do that joint effort again next year.  I don't know what kind of bet Peter lost, but his hat is just darling don't you think?    Saturday night we gathered around the campfire once again and CCMT (Cliff) gave us a nice little guitar playing jam session.  DouG also had some great harmonica happening too.  It was really fun.         Here's Art giving direction to someone Yet Again.....    Alot of people left on Sunday and then by Monday Paul and I were alone.  We got ALOT of fishing in and caught over 45 pike (fishing for musky of course   ) and a few other assorted fish.  All ready to go....                Here's Paul with his entry for the smallest ""World's Greatest Sport Fish.""    Me with my new musky net  - Too bad we didn't get to use it...     Digger hung around out camp most days.  He's such a great dog.    One day we heard a big boat having trouble and stopped by to see what the problem was and if they needed any help.  They figured they got water in the engine and couldn't get it going again so we gave them a tow back to Samoset, where they were staying.  That was fun towing that boat behind ours all the way back.    The weather was unbearably hot the first three days and I ended up getting sun/heat stroke.  Felt pretty crappy for two days after that.  But I guess that's what you get for slathering yourself with dark tanning oil and wearing a bathing suit in the sun all day for three days for the sake of a tan.  Paul says I should just slather butter over myself next time if I want to cook that bad  Paul trying to keep cool with his portable fan that he McGyvered    To be Con't (too big for one thread.............)"

90215,Deg,2007-07-03 05:10:00,51,Thanks for sharing your pics Joey.  It's always great to come home and see Lakair through someone elses camera.  I can see why you 'hang around' for a week after the gang heads home.  It sure was quiet on Sunday night at your campsite.  We actually got to sit and talk to you and Paul.  Great pics ... love the wildlife ones .... and don't mean from that cabin by the docks. LOL
