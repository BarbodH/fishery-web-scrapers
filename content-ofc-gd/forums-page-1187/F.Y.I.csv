90051,martymonty,2007-07-02 16:14:00,26,"About a month ago I found a 2006 Yamaha 350 Raptor floating tires up by my dock. I brought it to shore and reported it to the OPP. The insurance company contacted me and it was stolen months ago and the owner was paid out. I came on here for  advice on my options. Tons of useful advice, thanks people.......and it worked out that the insurance company at first wanted me to buy it , I said no and that I wanted them to come and get it by July1st etc. etc......well.....they gave it to me clear and free,,,,, just doing the paperwork now, going to fix it up and try to sell it......thanks all!"
