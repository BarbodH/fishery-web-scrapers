89853,Shelley Cooper,2007-07-01 15:28:00,394,"Sorry for the delay in getting this up... but I've been working long hours since getting back home.... and just got some time this weekend to upload to photobucket ( OVER 100 pictures) …lol  and prepare a post…   We arrived at Lakair Monday afternoon... rained a few times on the way up, but it was dry at Lakair. We got set up and put the boat in the water... said hello to those that were already there and headed out for some fishing... we were right into some pike, but no Walleyes for us that night....    Tuesday morning it was raining again… not a lot, and not for long,  but enough to send our little dog scurrying for cover… Lew was right to her rescue, directing her to get under his table.. it was the funniest site…. But from that moment on, Lew became Kea’s (our dog) best friend…she even tried to follow him to breakfast…. lol  I had coffee with Lew almost every morning.. It was a pleasure to spend some time with you, Lew… we sure did enjoy your company and can see why you like to get up there early….. I hope the rest of your summer is as enjoyable…. This pic’s for Roy… lol  <Crafty Prince>… Graham had arrived while we were out fishing one morning, but we soon became reacquainted and enjoyed his company   We were all headed out that evening for some pike before the walleye hour and Graham offered us to join him in his boat….. Nice ride Graham.. no pike but Graham had the magic lure for Walleye.. he was catching fish after fish… he then offered both Chuck and I a copy of his own designed lure for Walleye.. I took him up on it and soon caught up to him… He said if I caught another walleye, he wanted his lure back…<he was jj> so we left at a tie… lol  Graham had caught the most beautiful Walleye I’ve EVER seen… have a look at the colours on this Walleye….The picture doesn’t do it justice… it was Blue and if you moved it around, it looked purple…. WTG Graham….  The next night we went out for Walleye with Graham again… and I think I was the ONLY one to catch any Walleye.s.. on Graham’s magic lure…. Hehehehe…  but Graham was catching these rock bass and he had to have a talking with them….He wanted Walleyes  We’d fish all morning and enjoy the company of others for the afternoon, back out fishing again for the evening bite and sat around campfires enjoying the evenings…It was a great week, nothing ever rushed… Joe, Art and Dawg.. it was great to see you every day for a week and a lot of fun getting to know you all better.. Thanks for coming all that way to visit and fish with our OFC Family  Friday Chris and Kevin put on a fish fry at Tombstone Island not far from the lodge… What a great time that was.. Just about everyone came and enjoyed… here’s a few pic from there, but there’s just too many for me to post them all…  Tombstone Island  Rich Clemens GCDawg I love this shot of Chuck and Kea in the background, looks like there’s an argument going on…lol  Some of the guys Lea and Maureen Ruth and Don’s grandson and what an awesome young man… Thanks for the walleye fillets.. They tasted great.. Great catch. Kevin cooking us up an awesome shore lunch Thanks Kevin...  The guys preparing to leave. We’re wondering if that’s where Chris keeps his secret bait… lol  Saturday gathering for the pike tourney… here’s a few shots The largest pike caught, winning the trolling motor Another nice fish, but not for the tourney and was life released.. WTG Cliff  Roy.. Great to see you again, as always....  TJ with his $100 dollar fillet knife… You did a great job with that Knife TJ.. thanks a bunch.. I didn’t get ONE bone… Ruth and Don… nice to see you both again Wayne and Lea.. Nice to see you again Wayne, and to finally meet your wife…I really enjoyed Lea’s company… an awesome lady.  Saturday night several of us gathered around Joey and Paul’s campfire.. Cliff started the evening off with some awesome tunes and a couple others’s soon joined in… I really enjoyed listening to the entertainment that night… Thanks guys…   The whole week was just amazing….We loved every minute of it… everyday someone would arrive and you had the opportunity to spend a little more time with each….I took over a hundred pictures and can’t possibly post them all…  Here’s the link to the rest.. Have a look, there may be a picture you’d like to have… if you want the full resolution picture, then please send me a pm and I’d be glade to send it to you….. http://s40.photobucket.com/albums/e236/Lad.../Lakair%202007/  Thanks again to Kevin, Leslie and staff for an awesome place to spend a holiday.. See you in the fall.. Thank you to all the OFC family for the internet home where we can all keep in touch, make new friends and share awesome times like this….  Thank you for all your help this morning Roy... I sure was starting to loose my head...  Shelley and Chuck.  Ps.. For those that know us and of Chuck’s accident… Chuck returned to work on Light Duties last Tuesday…"

90212,Deg,2007-07-03 05:00:00,51,"Had a great time with you guys again.  Those evening walleye trips are always fun .... especially fighting off the mosquitoes.  Tyler says thank's for the pics ... he's started an album of his fishing trips.  Graham didn't have to talk to the rockbass .... Ruth already warned him earlier. lol  Enjoyed those fillets you cooked up .... now we have a replacement for TJQ if he can't make the pike tourney due to other commitments ... ballet dancing, etc."

90290,lew,2007-07-03 13:07:00,12767," Shelly, it's always good spending time with you guys and especially nice having someone to share a coffee with before the sun comes up.  Kea's darned near as cute as Marvin and is welcome to my extra pork chops anytime. Don't worry about the dog bites on my hand though, I've reconsidered the lawsuit  I'll see the 3 of youz next year !!"
90297,LeXXington,2007-07-03 13:30:00,1928,"Super., Great too see you all again. Love that little dog of yours  See you next year,"
