90059,ricoboxing,2007-07-02 16:26:00,398,"just got back from sturgeon lake. i bought a kayak on saturday, and took it out today for some bass. caught a small muskie about 30"", then a pretty big one (for my standards) about 36"". After hooking the larger one, I just held on and this thing took me for a ride. Kept both of them for dinner!  just joking, got out the pliers and released both of them boat side. now i still gotta setup a camera mount so that next time ya'll will believe me. both were caught using a white spinner bait. can't wait to get out next weekend."
90060,TJQ,2007-07-02 16:30:00,7806,I believe ya... wiow.. lol.. taken for a ride... I had that happen in a canoe once... lol.. its a blast.
90066,douG,2007-07-02 16:57:00,2693,"That must have been wild, RB.  Sorta like hand to hand combat."
90068,Handlebarz,2007-07-02 17:04:00,3790,thats cool now ya need a video camera mounted up front that will take stills
90079,Crazyhook,2007-07-02 18:39:00,1154,awesome work in the yak!!
90168,jediangler,2007-07-03 01:22:00,1923,"Hey man, what kind of kayak did you buy? I used mine for two seasons before I rigged a camera mount. Best thing I ever did was get into kayak fishing. The stealth factor is awesome. Can't wait to see more reports from kayak anglers."
90172,Kev,2007-07-03 01:30:00,54,Now that sounds like my kind of ride. Great job.
90196,danbo,2007-07-03 02:38:00,2646,What boat did ya get?
90250,ricoboxing,2007-07-03 11:00:00,398,"i bought a paluski ripple that someone had on sale. it has a rod holder installed already,  and was painted a custom green color. a bit more expensive than the crappie tire or costco ones, but i plan on using it for duck hunting too, so this was the perfect one for me."
90305,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 13:40:00,7971,Now fishing in a kayak (or tube) sounds like a heck of a lot of fun!!!  Great job on the muskies...did you ever get and bass??
90316,ricoboxing,2007-07-03 14:00:00,398,"no bass, muskies probably ate them all! i counted about 8 dead carp too! smelt nasty!"
90348,Mike the Pike,2007-07-03 15:15:00,3421,Wow Kayak surfing with the Ski pulling sounds like a rush.  Looking forward to future pics.  MTP
90422,danbo,2007-07-03 18:15:00,2646,"Good choice on the kayak..fish on,bro!"
90423,tonyb,2007-07-03 18:21:00,1637,"I am still curious, do you roll over when you want to figure-8!?"
90424,ccmtcanada,2007-07-03 18:23:00,7971," LOL...dont know if I'd be rolling over trying to entice a 50+ inch muskie to bite my lure.  With my luck, it would find my head or arm a much more appetizing meal."
90508,[emailÂ protected],2007-07-04 00:15:00,25,"Good job  I also bought a kayak a couple of weeks ago and had a chance to get out onto the local res this saturday to fish for some predators...managed to land this 32"" pike before the wind got nasty and I called it quits. If you are ever looking for a kayak fishing partner give me a shout.  Cheers "
