The word is that these lakes have a good number of smallies and pike, and if you want to work a bit more there are some lakers and walleyes.  Any tips on presentation or depth would be appreciated.  Are these lakes so crystal clear that I need to take all the fireline and Power pro off my reels and replace them with mono?  I usually leave a mono leader on the end.   Has anyone stayed at this resort or know the area lakes?  We can't wait.  Any of your thoughts would be great. Thanks"

I'm just relating to my steelheading practices but generally those presentations are not far from the way we should present baits to fish in most cituations when water is gin clear. I'm old school,I like mono and I like using light pound test when fishing clear water mostly for the visibility factor. I'm shure you could run a long peice of flouracarbon to the end of your main line if you were using braided and feel your its acceptable but personally I still can't get over the fact that my main line would still be more than vissible especially to suspended fish that may not be lurking under my bait where the flouro is but instead getting spooked above my bait where the braided is definetely vissible.... There will be alot of different opinions on this subject but the bottom line is,do you feel confident that what you are doing is going to catch you a fish ????  Thats my opinion on fishin clear water.......  Cheers !!!"

Try different depths untill you find 'em.  Probably will be shallow in the morning and at dusk and deeper during the day."
90167,Daplumma,2007-07-03 01:18:00,1961,Clear water would mean long casts and light lines for smallies.Maybe mono with a flouro leader.Senkos would be killer in those conditions down here.Best of luck Joe
