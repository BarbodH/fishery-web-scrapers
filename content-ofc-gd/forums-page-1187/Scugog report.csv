Got there around 9 am and the bites were pretty slow. Nothing really was biting until around 1 pm, that's when I landed a personal best of mine, a 3 lb 14 ounce 18 inch largemouth bass. All thanks to the moss mouse.  "

90219,Mark.O,2007-07-03 05:28:00,15,"douG, I used the ""moss mouse"" by snagproof, in the white color. Nothing beats the moss mouse for top water fishing, in my opinion. I've had a decent amount of hits on it (this being the first landed fish on it actually) but nothing bit it like this bass. If you're going top water fishing, I really recommend it. And if you do get it, make sure you bend the hooks up to increase your chances of hooking the fish, that's what helped me out.  -Mark"
