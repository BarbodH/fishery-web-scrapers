First Bent Rods went after getting too big and tanking their server, then ours got gang mugged by spammers and last week the Bigfish Tackle topsite ranking script collapsed and died under the weight of spam and sheer size. We still have our stats link on the bottom, but no more site rankings. Too bad the spammers had to wreck it all."
