90225,lew,2007-07-03 08:28:00,12767," Mornin Moe, and your right, it's  been awhile since the early morning club had a meeting.  They used to be alot of fun, but would you believe I actually received a PM from one of our long standing members one day telling me that I only instigated the ""Good Morning"" threads to pad my post count ??  That's what some folks do when they don't have much of a life I spose.  What a moron....."
