The biggest was 41"". We didn't see any big fish (over 45"") this year and much of the week was kind of slow fishing, but in the end we did fairly well. Our best fish were boated using jerkbaits: Suicks and Bobbies. I did manage a 40"" on a Musky Magic Instigator. I also boated a couple of nice walleyes on musky gear; a 3lb and a 5lb. We also had a blast catching and releasing many bass up to 4lb while taking a break from musky fishing.  The weird thing was that we hardly had any follows, missed strikes or lost fish. I think we had 3 follows, 2 missed strikes and only 1 lost fish.  Tom"

90474,Rizzo,2007-07-03 21:14:00,4754,nice report and welcome to the board.  Pretty sure I'm at 14 muskies for a lifetime so I'd say 14 is a pretty dang good week!
