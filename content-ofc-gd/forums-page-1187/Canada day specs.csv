Woke up Monday morning at 5:30 am due to feed call by our 11 day old addition to the family, no way I'm going back to bed with the sun coming up, figure go grab some java. On the way to Timmy's notice rods in the back figure why not? Coffee in hand and a whole 5 minute drive from my front door can't think of a better way to start Canada day. Only 45 minutes of fishing and about a dozen caught - yes all went back in. It's a beautiful thing no more that 15 KM north of Steels ave in T.O.  and you wouldn't believe me if I told you the creek isn't 18 inches across at certain points.    "
