I was wondering if anyone knows any good fishing spots in the area or a general area I could go fishing? I've looked around the web but can't find any information. It's right on Lake Huron, so I assume there must be some good areas to go fishing. Anyone have any idea?  Thanks for any help or suggestions.  -Mark"
