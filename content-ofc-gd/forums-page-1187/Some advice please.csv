Nothing else, just the rods and tackle box...my $500. boat left intact. We went for icecream instead. This afternoon I realized my OutDoor card was in the tackle box. Any idea about what I should do?...Holiday Mondays are hard for contacting government people because the smart ones are out fishing. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."

90249,Blake,2007-07-03 10:57:00,418,Call the MNR asap and see what they can do for ya.  Also if you have an old card around or a copy of your # on the card would help expedite things.

90287,Baptiste,2007-07-03 13:04:00,37,"Thanks for the link and the advice. I'm getting a replacement card for $9.91, not too bad I guess. I only get out once in while and usually on short notice, so I thought I was smart to have everything together...I think I'll need a new plan. I'll be picking up cheap replacements this week. Thanks again for the quick replies."
