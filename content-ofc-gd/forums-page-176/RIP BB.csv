915307,Steve,2015-05-15 11:11:00,2075,"when I heard this morning a large lump in my throat formed.  BB was, *and still is*, a Legend.  my second concert ever was BB King Blues Fest in Toronto....I was 15 years old. He was a legend then, and still is now.  Thanks for your contribution to the world Mr King.  "
915310,adam lancia,2015-05-15 11:26:00,234,"That's a sad way to start the day right there...  While living in Germany, I stopped in at a concert of his in a knee-jerk decision. I can't remember what year that was, probably 2010 I think. Anyways, he wasn't able to start for very much of the show and he certainly didn't have the pipes I heard when I listened to his recordings BUT, he still had a massive presence on stage and did still very much sound like the blues. He is the first of my music idols that I ever got to see perform live. I'm so thankful that I took the opportunity to see him. He will be sorely missed..."
915313,bigugli,2015-05-15 11:37:00,6138,"Pretty soon none of my musical idols will be left to thrill me.  The joys of getting older, but not as old as the Mrs. Lol"
915316,dave524,2015-05-15 12:14:00,4508,"My wife woke me this morning to tell me, she knew I was a fan, I had just watched a recent biography,  2013 I believe, called ""The Life of Riley"" a couple of days ago. For me BB was probably the most identifiable guitarist, just one note and you knew it was him. RIP"
915327,JoshS,2015-05-15 15:17:00,729,Wow. RIP B.B... The thrill is gone  I've always really appreciated his style.
915329,blaque,2015-05-15 15:34:00,2419,just one note and you knew it was him.  Well put.........  A regret of mine to never have seen him live
915340,TennesseeGuy,2015-05-15 16:54:00,957,I played his stuff on my ride Wednesday from International Falls to Red Lake.   Do it every trip up here from an SD card I insert in my navigation system.
915356,misfish,2015-05-15 18:47:00,29133,"Heard that this morning driving up for breaky with the parents. My pop told me about when I arrived up there as well. He said man,Im getting old.LOL  I heard he was inspired at a young age by his minister, who played the guitar during sunday church.  . Another great blues fenom, has left us.   https://youtu.be/iUaevnP1LLg"
915387,spincast,2015-05-15 22:27:00,3279,"BB was an amazing artist, mentor and all around gentleman to so many who played the blues. His list achievements is staggering. If you happen to have Sirius radio, BB Kings Bluesville has been recognizing his music and achievements all day.  In the several hours I have listened , not one song repeated. I came to appreciate his talent far too late, but perhaps that only served to heighten my appreciation.   BB King may be dead, but his music will live forever, and continue to inspire generations."
915431,Steve,2015-05-16 17:00:00,2075,And it will...  Jerry Garcia is as popular as he ever was....and he's been gone for 20 years this year. RIP
