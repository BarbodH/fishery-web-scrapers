914732,PBenson,2015-05-12 02:05:00,154,Here's a video I made from this years walleye run. One of the best times of the year to fish around here!  
914737,porkpie,2015-05-12 02:13:00,2521,"Great vid!  We have had some fun times on the D and boated some real hogs!  Still looking for a decent B&B or motel in Lasalle.  It's an exhausting day trip and sleeping in the truck sucks!  Not so keen on Windsor, when the Metro needs a security guard, I don't hold out much hope for my boat LOL."
914741,PBenson,2015-05-12 02:17:00,154,Lmao yeah definitely don't leave your boat outside downtown windsor at night it's sketchy as hell. Lasalle is your best bet to be honest.
914787,jtracc,2015-05-12 11:40:00,97,"Was out there for the first time few weeks ago.  My buddy has family in lasallle so we left the boat on the driveway and stayed at a hotel. The fishing was ok, I expected a little more action but we managed about 45-50 fish over 3 days. I think next year I will go a little earlier and fish for the hens."
914815,MrSimon,2015-05-12 15:01:00,217,Awesome video!!!  Jig ... jig ... jig ... SET.  Watching that NEVER gets old.
914816,landry,2015-05-12 15:17:00,1005,I went twice early in the season and we got some serious hogs - fish up to 12lbs. Great vid.
914817,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 15:20:00,4661,Love the jig bite... Good job boys
914895,Ralph Field,2015-05-12 21:57:00,1018,Looks like a blast !
914904,Joeytier,2015-05-12 23:01:00,3990,Awesome video for guys like me that can't fish for the wallys yet!
915005,Moosebunk,2015-05-13 12:20:00,3970,"Uggghhhh!!!  All that walleye jiggin' gets me all horny to do some walleye jiggin'.  Too much fun.  That steelie would be a great surprise too.  If I can ask, while you are drifting with the current I presume, what weights do you use to keep vertical on the Detroit?"
915007,porkpie,2015-05-13 12:25:00,2521,"A good all around is 3/4, as sometimes you can be jigging in current at 40 feet plus depths.  Some guys use an ounce, but I think it's seldom required and I've only used jigs that heavy in the deepest water when I wanted a big profile jig/grub.  We use 5/8th and occasionally 1/2 ounce in tighter to shore.  Basically the lightest you can get away with and stay vertical."
915008,PBenson,2015-05-13 12:26:00,154,5/8oz minimum but usually 3/4oz. Some guys use 1oz but I think that's a bit big.
