915184,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:24:00,11391,  Good times
915185,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:24:00,11391,Uggh  How to post a vid???
915186,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:36:00,11391,Meh I guess you can view it by clicking on the image and openining it
915188,MrSimon,2015-05-14 15:41:00,217,It's a fuzzy video.  Are you guys shooting arrows back and forth at each other!?  If so ...... that's awesome!
915193,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:56:00,11391,Thats exactly what we are doing.  Closest wins
915194,lew,2015-05-14 16:03:00,12766,Thats exactly what we are doing.  Closest wins  We played a similar game when we were kids back in the 50's but we'd take turns shooting our arrows straight up in the air then see who could stand closest to where it would land.  Goofy stuff we used to do but we all survived....somehow
915195,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 16:11:00,11391,Lol. Its fun!  Just so no one gets upset they are blunt arrows shot on a banshee kids bow.  Its hard judging the wind and distance
915200,bigugli,2015-05-14 16:46:00,6138,"Kinda like when we used to play chicken with our pocket knives. Toss it tween the other guys feet to reduce the gap, or til someone cried chicken. No one ever got stuck."
915204,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 16:50:00,11391,"See. Its totally safe!  Now pellet guns, till someone looses an eye...  ???"
915205,lew,2015-05-14 16:52:00,12766,"Lol. Its fun!  Just so no one gets upset they are blunt arrows shot on a banshee kids bow.  Its hard judging the wind and distance  No toys for us Rick, we used real bows and real arrows but looking back over the decades it's hard to believe we actually did all those crazy things when we were young & dumb and lived to tell the tales LOL"
915207,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 17:00:00,11391,Yeah thats gnarly. When i was a kid we did use pellet guns. Hurt like hell.  But it was fun lol
915217,irishfield,2015-05-14 18:14:00,26272,"Was gonna say Lew.. ""blunt arrows"".. where's the fun in that!!"
915220,Dara,2015-05-14 18:49:00,3052," We played a similar game when we were kids back in the 50's but we'd take turns shooting our arrows straight up in the air then see who could stand closest to where it would land.

915221,Headhunter,2015-05-14 18:56:00,5703,"We made beer can canons when we were kids. The old tin beer cans for those of us old enough to remember them, made great canons. Get 5 beer cans and cut the bottoms and tops off of four of them. The remaining can, make a hole with a nail at the bottom side of the can, opposite side of the push/pull opening at the top. This can is your bottom can. Tape all five together with duct tape. Drop in a few drops of lighter fluid and push a tennis ball down the top of the canon, into the second can from the top. I believe that there is a youtube link if you search beer can canon. HH"
915224,lew,2015-05-14 19:14:00,12766,"Was gonna say Lew.. ""blunt arrows"".. where's the fun in that!!  Yeah, for sure Wayne, if you can't poke the odd hole in the top of your head your not really having much fun"
915247,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 22:56:00,11391,Well we did also shoot arrows with fireworks attached at each other...  I figured that one might be too much for OFC
915263,bigugli,2015-05-15 01:11:00,6138, That was our potato gun. Wire wrapped and duct tape. Could launch a spud the length of two football fields.
915278,ketchenany,2015-05-15 01:54:00,3229,"Well I missed a lot, you guys had fun or tried to harm yourselves! delivering 80 Globe and Mail papers for 6 days (2 hours/day) at 5 am took a lot of me, especially in the winter.  and then on Sunday knocking on doors trying to get paid, even worse."
915279,manitoubass2,2015-05-15 02:01:00,11391,Come for a visit... ill shoot some flaming arrows at ya!  Never too late???
915282,irishfield,2015-05-15 02:33:00,26272,"They work better if you cut 1/2 of each lid off the can and turn them a quarter turn to each other Joe (gets the explosion twirling). Tape them together, make a barrel and away you go. ""when we were kids"", guess that was last summer as the one I made for Kristal blew a 1"" limb off the white pine above the deck.. about 30 feet up. The perfect bullet is a ABS glue can.. the ones with the little brush! lol Hard to find good soup cans that have both ends able to be opened, all them formed bottoms screw all the fun up these days!"
915293,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-15 06:07:00,8243,"Believe it or not we would play football with bow and arrow when we were kids. If you could catch an arrow you could catch anything. We didn't fire them at a few hundred feet per second, and to tell you the truth as I remember back 50 years they were kids plastic things, but it was fun. The other thing we did was play baseball with golf balls sometimes on asphalt or hardpan. If you could hit a golf ball or catch one a hardball looked like a beach ball coming over the plate or into your glove. The kids we played with played on the same Bantam team and won the city championship 3 years straight. We had to play on a farmers field and their actually a few in the east end of Hamilton in the 60's. You can hit a golf ball a long way, breaking apartment windows on the 7th floor was doable. Our coach had the entire team practice with golf balls. They came at you fast."
915328,fish_fishburn,2015-05-15 15:20:00,1311,Roman Candle fights were always a good time.
915333,manitoubass2,2015-05-15 16:05:00,11391,We still do riman candle fights hahaha  So fun. Pretty pricey these days though
915416,Fishwilly,2015-05-16 12:11:00,206,"Blunt arrows or not , one small mishap and someone loses an eye. This ones going up for a Darwin award!!"
915417,manitoubass2,2015-05-16 12:16:00,11391,"Too each their own I suppose.  I like to have fun. Its not like we were shooting horizontally at each other.  You can see the arrow for long enough to easily move if its going to hit you.  Lighten up, have some fun?"
