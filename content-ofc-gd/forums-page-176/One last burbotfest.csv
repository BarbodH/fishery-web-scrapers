Got on the water just before 10, and fished until around 12:45 and boated 15 ling, taking home 8 of nicest size fish.  Capped off the night (and season) with an absolute brute, far and away my PB and the biggest I've ever laid eyes on in person....and the meal will be fantastic!"
914984,Sandbag,2015-05-13 10:50:00,533,That Ling is HUGE......nice going  Cheers Craig
914985,Roy,2015-05-13 10:54:00,13728,"Happy days!!! You guys did well, Joey. Thanks for the pics."
914990,Acountdeleted,2015-05-13 11:27:00,2562,Very nice. Looks like it's going to be a feast!
915000,Moosebunk,2015-05-13 12:06:00,3970,Haha!  Those things are freaks.  Each time hooking one from bottom for some reason I think alien abduction while they're pulled up to the mothership hole by my fishin' pole.
915002,Steelheadphycho,2015-05-13 12:10:00,470,That monster ling is RADD!  Nice work!
915013,chris.brock,2015-05-13 13:01:00,4053,"That's a monster! That sounds like a lot of fun, I wish I had a spot like that."
915041,mr blizzard,2015-05-13 15:56:00,1589,Awesome and big. We used to throw them back till we moved up here. A neighbour gave us some fillets wrapped in bacon did them in the oven mmmm good Glad u had a great day
915044,Joey,2015-05-13 16:11:00,9122,"Holy cow that's a brute, well done Joeytier"
915045,NAW,2015-05-13 16:15:00,4022,That a tank Joey!!!  Great times!
915048,AKRISONER,2015-05-13 16:39:00,5558,"unreal, havent seen a burbot that big in a while.  My cabin in bakers narrows in Manitoba on little athapapskow was situated where the world record was caught in 94...it has since been beaten but it was cool knowing that the all tackle world record was caught within eyesight of my dock."
915056,Joeytier,2015-05-13 17:29:00,3990,That's cool.  That's not a record I think I'll be beating in my lifetime lol
915059,highdrifter,2015-05-13 17:46:00,2534,Nice eelpouts mane!!  Must be a trip fishing from a boat in pitch darkness like that.  Hoping to do that up in Temiskaming this weekend..  Got a spot that produces bigguns when the spring is late and the pickerals aren't on the feed yet..
915061,Joeytier,2015-05-13 17:49:00,3990,"Hah, that's funny.  That's where I live (if you're referring to the town of Temiscaming and not Temiskaming shores/tri-towns area)"
915074,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-13 19:31:00,937,Awesome....those are crazy looking fish
915115,Pikeslayer,2015-05-14 01:04:00,1443,Interested to see your recipe JT?
915128,Joeytier,2015-05-14 02:44:00,3990,"Hot butter and a light coating of garlic & butter fish crisp.  Tough to beat!  Though I haven't tried preparing them scallop style yet (cubed, boiled and dipped in garlic butter is apparently excellent too)."
915136,OhioFisherman,2015-05-14 03:22:00,6623,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbot  My dad used to ice fish for them on Lake Erie, he called them Lawyers. I was to young to remember seeing one or eating one. I have never caught one or seen one caught on Lake Erie.  Nice catch, I can imagine catching one like the record might be fun? and probably terrible eating?"
915158,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 12:17:00,11391,Whoa thats a fatty!  They get pretty big around here but they are longer and dont get fat like that.  Wanna freak out a new angler take him/her fishing for ling/lawyer/burbot! Priceless when people freak as the fish wraps around your arm hahaha
