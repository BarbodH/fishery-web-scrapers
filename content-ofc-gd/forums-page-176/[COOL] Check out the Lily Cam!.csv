915134,Dozer,2015-05-14 03:17:00,896,Cool gadget - probably need an open area for it.  Lily Shot : Crash into Tree will be a good way of burning time on Youtube
915163,Fishwilly,2015-05-14 12:46:00,206,Checked out their website. $519 for preorder. Up there with GoPro but this unit flies. Pretty cool. Would get awesome shots fighting salmon on lake O.
915179,MrSimon,2015-05-14 15:06:00,217,"That.  Is.  Awesome.  I've always thought drones were a great way to take video, but it's hard to control a drone while also landing a fish.  This would be ridiculously awesome!!"
915181,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:18:00,11391,"How the????  If its as easy as it looks, we are about to see some deadly footage"

915236,MrSimon,2015-05-14 20:41:00,217,I am ordering one right now! I think I will too .... $500 seems like a smoking good deal.  Are you at all worried that they won't be delivered in February .... or that you'll never see your money again?

915244,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 22:06:00,11391,So many applications  This will make home videos so awesome
915252,206,2015-05-15 00:05:00,563,"We were talking about that today,a buds father has one with the watch.30 mins he can get,there is a light on the watch that starts changing color meaning time to head back to hand lol.He says unless you see it,you can't believe it.Included go pro.Awesome deal !!!!!$490 he paid. get me a link...if he got a drone and cam for 490 i'll take 2 lol   there are others like this, HEXO and such but the price tags are outrageous....500 seems like a steel if they materialize lol"
915254,limeyangler,2015-05-15 00:18:00,5204,I think I will too .... $500 seems like a smoking good deal.  Are you at all worried that they won't be delivered in February .... or that you'll never see your money again?  I would say yes to both those questions. Would a credit card not cover you in some way should they disappear?
915256,206,2015-05-15 00:42:00,563,"http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lily-drone-flying-action-camera,news-20916.html  They sound like they are a ways away from a final product?"
915259,limeyangler,2015-05-15 01:06:00,5204,"Done, just pre-ordered……bit of a risk….but hey…IF IT WORKS!"
915270,SuperDave,2015-05-15 01:22:00,204,I heard they were going for $1000 .... $500 would be a great deal! I think they are not refundable though if they crash into something. Not 100% sure about that.
