Anybody had this problem before? I'd appreciate some advice.  Thanks!"

Also there are screws to tighen up the movement of the motor it,s self.(moving it left to right) I found this out the hard way. Taking a motor that was used by a steering wheel,then putting on a boat as a tiller."

915487,Garnet,2015-05-17 09:56:00,2056,Is the motor super easy to turn when not running.  Thiers adjuster screw. It's on the shaft that the motor turns on. Get that adjusted then mess with the trim tap.
