What I don't have is a Mercury lifting ring that screws in at the flywheel to make the lift safe and easy. I'd take the boat to a mechanic but once I get the motor off I may have to do some extras like cables, etc. I've seen them online (stateside) but I'd rather not spend $50++ US for what will probably be a one hour job. I've got a 200hp EFI. Anyone have have one I could borrow/rent? Hamilton area. Thanks!"

915480,ctered,2015-05-17 01:30:00,40,Check your pm. I have one you could borrow and should fit as long as your motor is not an Optimax.
915489,Garnet,2015-05-17 10:00:00,2056,I've seen the ring ones at CTC.  Some have 3 screws going thru a round piece of aluminum with a chain out the middle.
