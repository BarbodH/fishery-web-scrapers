914703,huzzsaba,2015-05-11 23:54:00,884,Wondering where I can buy one of these for cheap or if you guys know any place that rents these out so that I don't have to buy one.  I need one to cut exhaust pipe from a car at the scrap yard.  Would like to go prepared in case there is not enough clearance to use a hacksaw.   Thanks

914712,ecmilley,2015-05-12 00:56:00,2163,Cordless chop saw is what i use but if you want a.chainncutter carquest or napa can supplie them aroind $40
914736,tender52,2015-05-12 02:10:00,270,I usually just break the bolts off.

A sawzall (battery powered) will cut through the bolts attaching the exhaust system to the manifold easily."
915046,jimmer,2015-05-13 16:15:00,2730,That pipe cutter won't work on a metal exhaust. They're made to cut cast iron pipe.
915087,aplumma,2015-05-13 20:55:00,6896,Cast iron cutter will not work. There is a similar looking device for cutting exhaust pipes but much smaller called a chain wheel cutter. I use a  18 volt grinder with a keef or cut off  blade to cut metal pipes and bolts when the plasma cutter is not around.   Art
