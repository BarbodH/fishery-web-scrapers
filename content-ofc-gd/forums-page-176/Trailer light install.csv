915753,John Bacon,2015-05-19 02:35:00,3277,I usually disconnect mine; but I have not had a problem when I forget.
915355,mistaredone,2015-05-15 18:46:00,913,I picked up a set of submersible trailer lights from CT. They provide merits to connect the wires at the lights?  Would that not short out the light when submerged?  I was expecting to connect the wires at the pug or a different connection with shrink tubs??  Any advise would be appreciated.
915357,mr blizzard,2015-05-15 18:54:00,1589,"I am not sure but we always disconnect the wiring at the hitch before backing in the water, just to be on the safe side, no power no shorting out"
915358,mistaredone,2015-05-15 18:56:00,913,Good thinking. Never done that before.
915359,chefboi17,2015-05-15 19:01:00,128,"I unplug when launching. However I did use the merettes, I used die electric grease to fill the void and waterproof the connections. I figure if I have an issue, a greased merette is easier to take apart roadside than a solder and heat shrunk connection"
915360,mistaredone,2015-05-15 19:06:00,913,Just took off the broken light and it was connected with a merit and filled with what I thought looked like silicon. Maybe it's die electric grease?
915365,BillM,2015-05-15 20:04:00,17367,"I never disconnect the trailer when launching, never an issue.  I'm running LEDs on our boat trailer (And pretty much anything else we tow)"
915366,irishfield,2015-05-15 20:07:00,26272,I always said that too Bill.. never an issue with my 2003 F150 and the first time I backed the trailer in with my '11 it blew the fuse. With mine I have to wait 'till I'm right down the ramp.. as I have an electric pressure release solenoid on the surge brakes.  Throw the maretts away and buy a few GOOD butt connectors with the silicon inside them. Once they're squeezed they're sealed.
915368,mistaredone,2015-05-15 20:18:00,913,"Yeah, I picked up but connectors and heat shrink. I'll keep all the tools I need just incase I have problems on the ramp on Sunday. Thanks guys"

Would that not short out the light when submerged? I was expecting to connect the wires at the pug or a different connection with shrink tubs?? Any advise would be appreciated.  Use heat shrinkable crimp connectors. They are totally waterproof when sealed. They have them @ my Canadian Tire here.    There is hot melt glue on the inside of the heat shrink tube to seal the connection.  
915398,ecmilley,2015-05-15 23:52:00,2163,Yup shrink sleeve with the sealant inside or the line of connectors that have the sealant inside. Never unhook lights on ranger trailer with all sealed lights. Ssome of the older trailers that had the standard 1157 bulb s unhooked them cold water and hot glass a nono
915399,mistaredone,2015-05-16 00:07:00,913,Dam!  Time to re-do the whole thing
915405,Fisherman,2015-05-16 02:04:00,7201,"Dam! Time to re-do the whole thing And don't wait tooo long, the copper will start corroding as time goes by."
915411,mike rousseau,2015-05-16 02:57:00,4661,I slaughtered mine last year...  Gunna redo em soon
915437,Steve,2015-05-16 18:23:00,2075,"since the old man put LED's (not crappy tire ones...they burnt out within a year....but ones that came from a marina and cost about 1.5x's the cost) on my trailer, I've never unplugged, and never had an issue...this will be the third season.  buy quality LED's and you don't have to worry about unplugging them."
915500,SRR,2015-05-17 13:20:00,10,I always run a separate ground wire from the tongue back to each light and bonded to the frame at each end.  Most of the issues I've ever had with trailer lights were due to a bad ground or continuity from the front to the back of the trailer.

915685,Sinker,2015-05-18 22:29:00,8692,"Unplugging lights is just one of my regular routine things to do when launching. Actually, its the first thing I do.  S"
915699,chris.brock,2015-05-19 00:23:00,4053,"You're getting out of the truck to do stuff anyways, why not unplug the lights, my regular routine too.  I don't know why, but trailers suck. Bearings, tires, lights, axles, winches, seem to be constant trouble."
915700,BillM,2015-05-19 00:25:00,17367,"Safety chain, straps, transom saver, launch boat, lol."

915711,chris.brock,2015-05-19 00:57:00,4053,"Funny mistar, last week I bought the same light kit you bought for my tinny, and a new tire and rim for my pontoon trailer.
