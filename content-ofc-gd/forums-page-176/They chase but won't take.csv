915362,fishnguy,2015-05-15 19:16:00,96,"Hi everyone  It's been a really slow spring on Georgian Bay (Owen Sound).  I've had a hard time getting onto salmon or trout consistently.  Since trolling the usual spots has been so unproductive, I decided to try my hand at jigging.  Check out this pic of my fish finder.  http://s1083.photobucket.com/user/nibbly1/media/photo1_zpsifaprbxz.jpg.html  You can see my jig falling on the left side of the screen and a fish rising to check it out/chase it up.  They were doing this all day....chasing my jig up but never taking it.  You can also see a couple others hanging on bottom.  I assume these are lakers????  I was using a jig and white grub.  Anyone have any tips on how to get these guys to take the bait?  Is there a better bait I should be using?  Thanks!"
915364,BillM,2015-05-15 19:48:00,17367,"Could be lakers, whitefish or cisco.    Try to upsize or downsize your bait, switch up your jigging technique, dead stick, etc.  All sorts of things you can do."
915367,jimmer,2015-05-15 20:07:00,2730,I saw a show once where they were jigging for lakers and the trick was to keep bringing it up if a laker was chasing it. They said the fish would lose interest if you stopped the upward movement. They said to even increase the speed of the incline.
915370,fishnguy,2015-05-15 20:53:00,96,"Thanks.  We tried worms, spawn, different sized jigs....nothing.  maybe just not the right day. They would follow up about 10 ft no matter what I did....speed up, jig it up vs reel straight up, etc.  It was fun to watch them on the graph but frustrating at the same time.  I'll be back out there soon."

It goes against your instincts at first, but once you witness a laker speed up to match your increased speed its quite something! Sometimes you can't crank fast enough to trigger a strike, slow down or hesitate at all and they lose interest."
