915683,irishfield,2015-05-18 22:11:00,26272,It's a few clicks UP from Smiths Falls Rich.. up stream anyhow!  Current radar looks more like Land o Lakes and Carleton Place are going to get the HEAVY rain at this point. Right across Moosebunks yard by the looks of it... hang tight Drew!

915783,SirCranksalot,2015-05-19 13:07:00,3291,Fingers crossed for now.  I would never worry about it in Ottawa----chances are probably just slightly more that the Leaf winning the cup!!
