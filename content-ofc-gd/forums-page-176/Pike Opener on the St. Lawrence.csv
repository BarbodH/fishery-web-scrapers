914808,BillM,2015-05-12 14:39:00,17367,I see some pike and some chain pickerel.  Pretty cool!
914810,manitoubass2,2015-05-12 14:49:00,11391,I was just gonna say the same bill.  Very nice colours!  Looks like fun!
914812,Roy,2015-05-12 14:58:00,13728,"Yup, 2 chains. Looks like a good time."
914823,Joeytier,2015-05-12 16:12:00,3990,Had no idea the Larry had chains...cool!
914824,NAW,2015-05-12 16:14:00,4022,Nice outting!
914841,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 17:46:00,4661,Never seen a chain before... Very cool  Way to figure em out
914847,MrSimon,2015-05-12 18:01:00,217,"We were curious about the pickerel as well.  At first we wondered if they were actually pike with odd colors, but decided they look too much like a pickerel to be anything else.  I read that pike and pickerel do breed ... so maybe these are hybrids?  Either way, it's always fun to catch something you weren't expecting."

Hybrids would be my guess , they are pretty big for pure pickerel."
914876,craigdritchie,2015-05-12 20:24:00,1586,"Very common to catch chain pickerel that size, and up to about 5 pounds. World record is a little under 10 pounds.  Redfin and grass pickerel are much, much smaller."
914893,chris.brock,2015-05-12 21:40:00,4053,"That's a species I haven't caught, cool to see.  Gotta love pontoon party fishing."

Redfin and grass pickerel are much, much smaller.  My memories are of a much smaller fish as a youth, little research tells me the ones I was familiar with were the Grass Pickerel, we'd get the odd one as a kid in the Chippewa Creek/ Welland River up near Wellandport."
914903,Roy,2015-05-12 23:00:00,13728,Pike and pickerel (walleye) have absolutely nothing to do with each other.
914973,kenzy31,2015-05-13 04:44:00,261,Nice report! New waters are always rewarding to figure out 
914979,Roy,2015-05-13 10:10:00,13728,"Nice report! New waters are always rewarding to figure out  The pickerel you speak of is a nickname given to walleye. Chain, grass and redfin pickerel are of the esox family. Sometimes also referred to as Southern pike. When we go pickerel fishing down home in N.B., it's grass/chain pickerel we're after  That's exactly correct."
914980,dave524,2015-05-13 10:29:00,4508,"Previous to the 30's the fish we today call Walleye was known by many names including Yellow Pickerel, Dore and usually Yellow Pike stateside. At a conference a group of biologists in the 30's were not happy about this situation as the fish was clearly not a pike or pickerel and they came up with the name "" Walleye ""  as a common name. I still call Northern Orioles, Baltimore Orioles and Longtailed Ducks, Oldsquaws and probably the generation below me is still more comfortable with the old names, same situation."
915006,Moosebunk,2015-05-13 12:22:00,3970,"The pike are cool, but the pickerel... yeah, that's really neat to see."
