Why haven't they gone with sealed bearing/hub assemblies; they've been used for automotive applications for years. Is it cost?  Dan  Same as trailer wiring Dan, you'd think in the 21st century they could design some sort of system that wasn't always having issues. I can't recall the last time I ever had a problem with truck lights yet it seems most folks with trailers have lighting problems at one time or another even if it's not a boat trailer constantly in & out of the water.  I had a custom boat trailer built a couple years back with LED lights and they've been flawless until yesterday when I hooked it to the truck for the 1st time this year and noticed the trailer lights flickering.  You'd think something with as few miles as a boat trailer on it would last a bit longer."

915016,Garnet,2015-05-13 13:10:00,2056,Sinker do have Unique bearing system common on EZ Loader Custom Trailers. Skeeters and Sprint have them.  They have a cigar like stainless steel ring with a hole in it. Also have odd size seal on inside. I spent $160 to have one of these rings overnighted from Washington. Part $1

915019,mark demmery,2015-05-13 13:15:00,68,I have found a bit of that Pemtex black gasket maker around the plastic caps keeps them in place nicely. A quick slice with an exacto knife makes it easy to remove when its rebuild time...

But I wonder how many cars & truck that are driven year round, in all kinds of conditions for hundreds of thousands of kms and have never had to replace a sealed non serviceable wheel bearing/hub assembly; that are being used on better than 90% of today's vehicles? I'm not saying they don't fail; but nowheres near as much as a tapered roller bearing set up; even ones that have been properly maintained.  Like you said, if you get the axle (AKA Differential) below water; you had better check for contaminated axle lube.  Dan."

Thankfully a front mounted caliper, if it was rear mounted she'd very well be dead. It's a terrible design.. bearings are too close together to take the torsional load. I did those types of load calculations 'till the cows came home in my younger days.  Most vehicles are the same, I've put 3 hubs on Leah's 2003 Sporttrac... it has only 210K on it. First pair went at 55K under warrantee... and one of those was toast before it went home and back to Ford, so that's 6 now.  My '69 'Bee still has the original bearings on all 4 corners."

I think with your daughter in law's vehicle, I would unplug her stereo; that way she'll be able to hear the next bearing failing, long before it got to the point it did. LOL  Dan."
914834,Joeytier,2015-05-12 17:34:00,3990,"Just had the spring pop out of my bearing buddy while greasing, and what looks like a small o-ring seal.  There was definitely a 'popping' sound, so I obviously lost my seal.  Is this buddy still salvageable?  I'm about 45 mins from anywhere that would carry them so I'm hoping all is not lost.  I lost the rubber cap on this side and the replacements I bought were coming off every time I trailered so grit and dirt was allowed to get in, but I figured that since it was packed tight with grease, the grit was only contacting the very outside grease, staying away from any parts in the bearing.   "
914835,Roy,2015-05-12 17:37:00,13728,Looks like they might have been packed too tight.
914836,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-12 17:38:00,10439,Had a bearing cap fall off once while on a trip. As a temporary fix I used a cut off pop can and a hose clamp until I could get a replacement.
914837,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-12 17:39:00,10439,Looks like they might have been packed too tight.  My guess would be a plugged relief hole.
914838,Joeytier,2015-05-12 17:39:00,3990,I had been using caps off aerosol cans and duct tape...worked fine until rocks broke them into pieces lol
914855,mr blizzard,2015-05-12 18:55:00,1589, My guess would be a plugged relief hole. x 2 from personal experience
914856,Joeytier,2015-05-12 19:02:00,3990,"Well, I did some reading, and it turns out I knew a lot less about these buddies than I thought (my first trailer with them) lol.  The good news is that I didn't blow out the rear seal, but I was definitely overpacking both bearings, like to the point of packing until excess was coming out of the sides...at least I know now.  So the bearing is still packed tight, o-ring back in, and covered up.  The only thing that is not in there is the spring, which I'm sure I can do without until I'm ready to repack again (?), at which point I'll just replace both buddies anyway, since they could be as old as the trailer for all I know (08).  No other bearing systems have a spring loaded system that I know of, so I don't see how not having a spring in there is going to hurt me at least for the short run."
914863,mr blizzard,2015-05-12 19:49:00,1589,"I learned the hard way too, when installing new bearing buddies only install as deep as the inscribed ring, make sure the vent hole is clean and try to use a piece of wood between the hammer and the buddy.

Sinker X 2  X3 Manually repack the bearings twice a year; once at the end of the season and at about half way through the season. Why those time frames; you don't want to put the trailer away with water contaminated grease, to sit and rust over the winter. Half way through the season, for peace of mind that they're ok. Been doing that for years and have never had a bearing failure, out on the road; knock on wood.  Dan."
914887,Bernie,2015-05-12 20:59:00,3190,Not everyone is as diligent as others. Trailers I see come into the shop that have bearing buddies are almost always OK.Those that are not are usually empty of lube.

914890,NANUK,2015-05-12 21:28:00,797,"Personally I like them. When backing a warm hub assy. into the lake the small amount of pressure provided can help keep out water when the hubs are contracted by the cold water . Bingo !! That is exactly how bearing buddies work. they keep a couple of pounds of positive pressure in the hubs so the water does not enter when hub is dunked in cold water. I have them on my boat trailer for the last 12 years and the bearings and grease still look brand new when I inspect them every couple of years. Problem is that people overload them with grease and once the back seal pops, the pressure is lost and it defeats the purpose of having the bearing buddies."
914891,DanD,2015-05-12 21:32:00,2223,There's no doubt that buddies do work; they keep the bearings lubed between servicings. Huds still need to be disassembled and bearings inspected on a regular basis. People have to remember that a lot of these trailers are running relatively smaller wheels than an automotive wheel/tire assemblies. These little guys and their bearings could be spinning twice as fast as the tow vehicle's and need to be respected for the extra work they're doing.  Dan.
