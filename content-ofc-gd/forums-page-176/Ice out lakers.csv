913565,BillM,2015-05-04 14:55:00,17367,"suckers spawn right about at ice out......  Suckers are spawning right now, local creeks/rivers are loaded with them."
913566,chris.brock,2015-05-04 15:03:00,4053,"Suckers wouldn't be suspended 10 or 20 feet down.  What fishfinder are you using SCL? Seems wonky with those temp readings. I don't really use mine for looking for suspended fish 10 feet down. The beam is narrow and surface clutter shows stuff that may look like fish.  Lake Joe is likely similar. They were suspended 50' down over deep water (90 plus), could see them plain as day. Bassman found the same thing up on Kash.  Ciscos will show up as a thick school on the screen, deep, 40 plus feet down, usually suspended. If you see that, jig a smaller spoon right in the school, they often bite.  I tried some ice fishing spots where I fish on bottom and they definitely weren't there."
913568,Joeytier,2015-05-04 15:23:00,3990,"Chris, blue/silver was the steady producer all weekend, but I tried a charteuse/orange Cyclops yesterday for a few hours with good results...lucky strike half wave was working well too.  When you find active fish they're not at all picky lol"
915182,SirCranksalot,2015-05-14 15:19:00,3291,We are hoping to give it another crack tomorrow. Anyone hazard a guess as to how deep the lakers will be? Tactics different from 'ice-out'?  I just bought a Tadpole diver---should help to get down a bit.  http://www.offshoretackle.com/resettable_diving_weights.html
915187,BillM,2015-05-14 15:37:00,17367,"It's all dependent on water temp.  Once you figure that out, it should be fairly easy."
915189,Raf,2015-05-14 15:41:00,3495,"The water temp is likely comfortable for them from top to bottom.  Lakers are opportunistic feeders and  i would key in on what they are feeding on / what is emerging in the area that you are fishing and base it on that. ie. if they're eating bugs, they'll be shallow, if you see a lot of bait fish deep, fish deep."
915267,Sinker,2015-05-15 01:18:00,8692,I think your mistake last time was going too deep.  Fish the top 30ft.  Get a #7 and #9 rapala tail dancer and flatline it 100 ft behind the boat.
915460,SirCranksalot,2015-05-16 22:22:00,3291,"We went back yesterday for another crack. Water temp was around 10 deg, which seems to be an optimum temp according to what I have read. We caught 3 good sized bass--2 on Hot'nTot blue and silver and 1 on a Rapala. We had 1 fair sized laker----4-5 lb---in close to the boat and did a 'remote release  . It was also on the same Hot'nTot. We also tried Little Cleos and Flatfish w/o any hits.  Marked quite a few fish scattered throughout the water column. Given that we caught  3 bass I am guessing that most of the fish we marked the last time out were bass that were too cold to be interested in chasing bait."
915540,Sinker,2015-05-18 01:19:00,8692,"You didnt try the taildancers, eh?  Oh well, your loss  S."
913245,SirCranksalot,2015-05-01 12:55:00,3291,"My buddy and I were at lake Joe near Pt Carling today. We marked lots---and I do mean lots---of fish, presumably lake trout suspended at 10-20 ft deep. We mostly slow trolled lures such as fairly big Little Cleos and deep crankbaits with nary a bite. I think the lures were running deep enough as we both hooked bottom once or twice in maybe 15 ft of water. We also did a very slow drift with sinkers and worms over an area where we were marking fish i.e. ice fishing technique. again---nada. The water temp on my FF showed as zero. What gives??? Does the water need to warm a bit?We had never tried for ice-out lakers before."
913246,BowSlayer101,2015-05-01 13:00:00,296,"I usually troll body baits around dropoffs this time of year, should be fairly easy to tie into them, especially on Joe. If that doesn't work for you then try jigging minnows or spoons, always works, even in the summer. You have to play around with speed, baits, etc when trolling, its possible you were going too slow if you were hitting bottom a lot."
913269,Sinker,2015-05-01 16:52:00,8692,We already got into ice out lakers in the haliburton area. There was still ice on parts of the lake. I always troll rapala tail dancers. They work great for me.  S.
913270,123chadder,2015-05-01 17:00:00,165,best bet is maybe get a vexilar depththerm find out what depth is around 50 degrees.....go from there...
913273,SirCranksalot,2015-05-01 17:18:00,3291,best bet is maybe get a vexilar depththerm find out what depth is around 50 degrees.....go from there...  Given that it was zero at the surface I would assume that it was zero all the way to the bottom.
913275,BillM,2015-05-01 17:31:00,17367," Given that it was zero at the surface I would assume that it was zero all the way to the bottom.  If it's still that cold, they'll be all over the place.  Jig them out of deep water just like you would icefishing."
913277,misfish,2015-05-01 17:35:00,29133,"You might  of been marking loads of herring. I thought they were lake trout this winter, til I caught one.LOL  Got to get up there and try it this summer."
913279,SirCranksalot,2015-05-01 17:43:00,3291,"There were lots of well defined fish 'arches' about 15 ft down but sometimes just off bottom. we went from 50 ft to 10 ft or so. My guess is that until the surface warms a bit the fish have little incentive to move near the surface. When it does I guess they would move to warmer water near the surface to get more energy until the temps reach the upper limit of their 'comfort zone"". Does this theory hold water? (Ever met a fisherman w/o a theory??  )"
913286,BowSlayer101,2015-05-01 18:32:00,296,"I highly doubt the water temp is 0, you probably have something going on with your finder if its showing that temp."
913293,123chadder,2015-05-01 20:07:00,165,I'm pretty sure it's marking surface temp and there's no way surface temp is 32 degrees aka 0
913298,Joeytier,2015-05-01 20:53:00,3990,"Ice went out here 2 days ago, and we got into a few Lakers today.  The flatlining bite was very slow, but will pick up once the surface gains a few more degrees.  Jigging bucktails and gulp minnows on steep drops like you would ice fishing is a good bet for when the water is still icy cool."
913304,Musky or Specks,2015-05-01 21:12:00,2710, Given that it was zero at the surface I would assume that it was zero all the way to the bottom. Actually the warmer water will be on the bottom as water at its densist is 4 degrees.
913309,Sinker,2015-05-01 21:42:00,8692,"If the ice is off, there will be warmer water somewhere. North shorlines, and windblown bays/point always warm first."
913316,lookinforwalleye,2015-05-01 22:52:00,4399,Match the hatch so to speak....silver/grey/black Rapala
913319,kickingfrog,2015-05-01 23:35:00,8333,"Unless it's salt water, if it's zero, it's frozen."
913321,Cookslav,2015-05-01 23:44:00,1457," I'd agree, I like perch pattern as well. At ice out I exlusively fish the top 10' of water, and seem to do well.  It might just be my thoughts on the matter but I tend to find the active fish will come up for the bait. "
913377,4x4bassin,2015-05-02 14:41:00,1025,"From my experience on fishing ice out lakers is try to find some warmer water believe it or not . The warmest part of the lake will be in the north section , start there . The lake has to wake up from the winter and start the cycle of lake life . Once this happens (usually around 2 weeks of ice out) the lake trout fishing heats up . No need to fish deep , just make sure the bait is a long way from the boat while trolling especially in pressured waters or clear water . As for baits try to match the hatch . I like to use rapala tail dancers or deep husky jerks in natural colours or cleo/williams spoons . I find jigging very productive but this pattern doesn't really get going till the early summer when the lakers are schooling in deeper water as apposed to being scattered at this time of year . Good luck , can't wait for my own laker adventure in a week"
913391,Joeytier,2015-05-02 18:28:00,3990,Tried a new lake today with totally different results.  Flatlining cleos and Cyclops over 6-10 FOW boulder flats was the ticket
913413,chris.brock,2015-05-02 23:47:00,4053," Gull Lake, Haliburton yesterday (I hope my boss isn't reading this), most water was 45 degrees, I found some 54 degree water and caught 1 laker, most were suspended down 40 to 60 over deep water.  Bassman is up on Kash and same thing, suspended fish.  I've heard old timers say ""when the poplar leaves are the size of dimes"" and ""when the blackflies are at their peak"" is the best time for spring lakers, brookies, splake. There's only a few dopey black flies and the buds haven't popped at all. I think next weekend will be better fishing."
913434,4x4bassin,2015-05-03 02:33:00,1025,"I agree chris , the next couple weeks will be prime !"
913507,SirCranksalot,2015-05-03 23:06:00,3291,"Thx for the comments, guys.  I think the temp function on my FF was probably not working but the water was bloody cold. Dipped my hand in and it felt like ice fishing. My guess is that it was about 4-6 deg.  We didn't bother with buying minnows as we thought that some of the lures would work. We hope to get back up sometime mid-week to give those fish one more chance!! We might try minnows but I'm sure I'll try some of the tips offered here."
913511,Joeytier,2015-05-03 23:16:00,3990,Fished another new lake today.  Found a creek mouth with a pod of fish hanging off the mouth and a couple more flatlining on a steep breaking shoreline running as close to the shoreline as possible.  Cyclops was the ticket again
913518,chris.brock,2015-05-04 00:38:00,4053,Cyclops is my go to spoon for jigging and trolling.  What colour are you using Joey?
913554,SirCranksalot,2015-05-04 13:46:00,3291,Someone suggested that what we were marking was suckers. Aren't suckers mostly in the creeks spawning by now?
913562,123chadder,2015-05-04 14:41:00,165,suckers spawn right about at ice out......
