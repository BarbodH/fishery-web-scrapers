910019,Gallie,2015-04-14 11:56:00,1215,"I like to bottom fish for them myself, catfish rig with a worm will work or even just a single hook with a bell/slip sinker works wonders. I stick to worms they seem to work best for me"
910066,Fisherpete,2015-04-14 14:58:00,1814,"The water was pretty high, but the suckers were stacked up in one spot where there is an eddy... Small hook and small piece of worm did most of the damage, single Jensen egg caught a couple also."
910688,icedude,2015-04-17 19:18:00,459,Agreed.that presentation is proven  -Suckers in Rivers--kool thread-a sure sign of Spring  Hope to see some OFC'ers @ The Orillia Pech gig--got an old OFC car sticker TJ was kind enough to give me a few years back on my sweater-lol  Have Fun-Play Safe-Cheers !
910994,Gallie,2015-04-19 18:21:00,1215,"I went out on saturday and tried to get a couple suckers, the run where i went hadnt really reached the top yet but there was a few around. "
911045,Musky or Specks,2015-04-19 21:53:00,2710,There a few around.  
911057,Gallie,2015-04-19 22:31:00,1215,Cool pic
911066,Joeytier,2015-04-19 23:37:00,3990,MoS you found the motherload.  Would love to find a good run around here and make a few batches of canned suckers.
911069,Gallie,2015-04-19 23:50:00,1215,Canned suckers eh? I wouldnt eat them down here but ive had smoked sucker years ago and it wasnt too bad. I usually c&r fish for them outside of a couple for bait.
911070,Bondar,2015-04-19 23:51:00,817,"I went on Saturday and found nothing but dead trout about 8 of them, usually don't have an issue finding them in this creek"
911289,LostAnotherOne,2015-04-20 21:51:00,956,0/2 this year so far looking for suckers.  I got a spot and its just a matter of time before another PB enters my hands.
911374,Joeytier,2015-04-21 06:04:00,3990,I remember seeing some absolute gigantosaurus redhorse suckers in great lakes tribs
911638,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-22 14:29:00,937,Cool pic.... I saw lots spawning last weekend
911642,manitoubass2,2015-04-22 15:12:00,11391,"I jig em up.  3/4oz jig with a 3"" berkley ripple shad and they just suck em right up  Good fights when the run for current, especially 5-7lbers  Lotta fun.  I just c&r"

907921,Fisherpete,2015-04-03 17:38:00,1814,"Any of the river fishing folks seen suckers yet in the creeks or rivers? Time to start building my cutbait supply for catfishing!  The dew worms were out in full force on my lawn last night, the timing of that and the suckers in the creeks is usually pretty close...  Thanks Pete"
907936,manitoubass2,2015-04-03 18:38:00,11391,Suckers and pike are going nuts up here on Rainy river
907937,Christopheraaron,2015-04-03 18:47:00,3525,"Didn't get any the other day, I'll take another look next week."

907995,Fisherpete,2015-04-03 23:48:00,1814,"Thanks guys, I might go take a peek tomorrow."
908004,BowSlayer101,2015-04-04 01:18:00,296,"Was out on a gbay trib and quite a few monster ones out there. Lake o trib didn't have any suckers that I saw, or at least I didn't catch, just steelhead so far with a mix of the odd brown."
908014,Steve Piggott,2015-04-04 03:33:00,196,No sucker my way yet. Grand is clear of ice.
908016,Gallie,2015-04-04 04:11:00,1215,"Still ice in the holland, usually no snow or ice before i get em"
908042,duke01,2015-04-04 13:31:00,20,Tried the Grand yesterday with no luck. Water was up and dirty.
908079,Fisherpete,2015-04-04 17:11:00,1814,Thanks again guys! Heading to a local creek this afternoon for a peek.
908165,chefboi17,2015-04-05 06:39:00,128,"Might get out this week, will shoot ya a text if I see any around"
908619,icedude,2015-04-07 18:25:00,459,Not yet Pete and All.. here...Pefferlaw River System is unseasonalbly low-until such time as our friends and associates at Lake Simcoe Conservation Authority can get to the water levels-we need a lot of rain to bring in a perennial favourite of Spring fishing  Keep you posted  Paul.
908629,FloatnFly,2015-04-07 19:05:00,1640,saw a couple caught today in the east end
908644,Gallie,2015-04-07 20:08:00,1215,"I was reading the regs and it said pefferlaw brook is a fish sanctuary till may i think from 48 to the dam in pefferlaw, ive been scouting some new spots and came across that. I checked a few other local creeks and havent seen anything, water level is definitely low"
908685,Fisherpete,2015-04-07 23:42:00,1814,"Hit a local creek yesterday for a few hours and caught 4. They are in there, just not super stacked up yet. Hooked and lost two nice bows also - one was a 10+. Was nice to fish open water for the first time this year! Thanks for the help guys, appreciate it."

908707,Gallie,2015-04-08 00:34:00,1215,What no pics? Lol. After my mission today i believe ill be starting after we get all this rain. Looking forward to it.
908899,SirCranksalot,2015-04-08 21:31:00,3291,I've seen a few suckers here on the river. They weren't catching anything though because the water is very muddy!!

909957,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-14 00:43:00,937,They should be in most creeks and rivers by now.  I caught my first last weekend and saw some swimming up creek.
