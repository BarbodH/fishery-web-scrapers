I dont mind paying 40 bux for an item , but paying 50 bux for shipping on top of that. Thats just nuts. I can get it shipped half that by using works ups account,but would sooner deal with someone on the canadian side of the border if possible. I will give rockys a call tuesday, and theres also a place up in north bay I use to use many years ago for big jon down rigger parts. Those guys could get anything. Anyone have a lead for me/ Thanks    http://classicaccessories.com/pontoon-boats-and-float-tubes/fish-pontoon-boats.html  "
