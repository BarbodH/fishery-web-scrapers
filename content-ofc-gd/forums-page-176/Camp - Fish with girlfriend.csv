915064,theduster23,2015-05-13 18:42:00,11,Am looking to find a spot to camp / fish where I can bring my boat (40hp). I would be tenting it but would like to bring my 15ft aluminum for fishing as well. So far the front runner is Massassauga Provincial Park. Any suggestions?Pretty wide open on species. I prefer Walleye or bass personally.Thanks

915084,theduster23,2015-05-13 20:29:00,11,Ivanhoe seems a bit far (10hrs).... I'll keep it in mind for a different trip though.
915088,John Bacon,2015-05-13 21:03:00,3277,Algonquin allows boats on Lake Opeogno.  Motor boats are allowed on some other lakes too; but some of them may have horsepower limits.
915094,OhioFisherman,2015-05-13 22:32:00,6623,http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/sturgeonbay  Lots of sheltered water for a smaller boat?

Launch for free, park for free, camp for free.. leaves enough money to cover the gas there and back, AND your Beer!"
