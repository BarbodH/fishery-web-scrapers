The channel cats are waiting for 70 F water to head to the beds. The sure sign that it is occurring is the catching of small immature cats in places that a week ago brought in nice size ones. Once the males start to build the nest they get lockjaw till the nest is empty, Often 21-30 days. The females will move in to the shallows looking for a mate and then move back off to deeper water on the points to feed. The females will be pretty beat up mostly on the tails from the spawn and as the scars fade the males will appear very hungry. In a month from the spawn you will have a great time catching both large fish again.  Enjoy   Art"
