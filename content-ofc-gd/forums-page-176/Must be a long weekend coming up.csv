915178,lew,2015-05-14 15:00:00,12766,Went into town this morning and gas was $1.04 and came home an hour later and it had jumped 8 cents to $1.12  Odd  that it never drops 8 cents in an hour.  Good to know though that our government tells us there's no funny stuff going on with the oil companies.
915180,manitoubass2,2015-05-14 15:16:00,11391,Ah happy long weekend OPEC
915192,Gerritt,2015-05-14 15:56:00,6129,It's a load of crap. Gas was 99.4 here.... Jumped to 111.9 overnight.  What a crock.  G

915199,bigugli,2015-05-14 16:43:00,6138,They hit us last week with the $.15 jump from 98.5 to 113.5.
915266,Sinker,2015-05-15 01:15:00,8692,I thought it was all the idiots on the roads that made it obvious it was a long weekend. I dont even look at gas prices anymore.
915430,Beans,2015-05-16 16:59:00,3339,Curve Lake went from $0.979 to $0 999 on Friday morning...usually stop there if on my way down or back from P'Boro...
915432,Steve,2015-05-16 17:26:00,2075,"I know most won't want to hear this (as a sign of complacency), but I too don't even pay attention to gas prices anymore.  We can't control it, so why worry about it.  We have enough to worry about that IS within our control, why worry about what isn't?"
915434,glen,2015-05-16 17:50:00,2641,The lucky people that own the world need a little more.
