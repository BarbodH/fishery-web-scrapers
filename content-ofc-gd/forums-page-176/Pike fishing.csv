914857,shimano19,2015-05-12 19:05:00,196,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to take my dad pike fishing this weekend on our boat hoping to land some nicer sized ones. We don't target them very much so I would appreciate if someone led me in the right direction in terms of what lake to try, willing to travel 2-3 hours from toronto. Thanks"

914865,AKRISONER,2015-05-12 19:56:00,5558,same with GB...i always say big water big fish..but the work is much harder.

There are also some giant crappie to be caught here now too.  https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Honey+Harbour,+ON/@44.875937,-79.8201529,2097m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2ae7a34a9fdca3:0x73782744a5fe9b47"

914935,Rizzo,2015-05-13 01:10:00,4754,Lake St. john near Orillia used to always cough up scads of pike when I used to go there. Lake Muskoka too...chance at some bruisers

914951,BillM,2015-05-13 01:45:00,17367,"Id recommend HH, ill be at gloucester pool for the whole weekend. Dont usually do too well there though.  A decent amount of 'Ok' pike (say 5-8lbs) but you'd be hard pressed to get anything bigger with consistency..  Some giant muskies, but those are few and far between.    I fish it all the time (Probably 2-3 times a week once late May hits)..  Fun lake, the boat traffic can be awful however and she whips up quick with the right wind."

915191,shimano19,2015-05-14 15:55:00,196,Don't you need a harbour permit for the toronto islands? And I heard the launch is a decent drive away.
915210,John Bacon,2015-05-14 17:18:00,3277,"Don't you need a harbour permit for the toronto islands? And I heard the launch is a decent drive away.  Yes, if you are driving a motorized boat (even if it is just an electric motor) you need a harbour license around the islands.  The public boat launches are Ashbridges Bay to the east or the Humber River to the west."
