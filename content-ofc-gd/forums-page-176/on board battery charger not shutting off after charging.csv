915317,Lunkerhunter,2015-05-15 13:42:00,455,hey guys a quick question. after my last trip I plugged in my on board charger and everything looked normal. after a few days I went and checked on my boat and noticed the charger was still charging. I disconnected my charger and hooked up a battery meter and the batteries were fully charged.  any ideas why the charger did not shut off and show that the batteries were fully charged?  I am using a minnkotta on board charger.  is it pooched? its only a couple years old.  your help is greatly appreciated

If it only does it with one battery then if may be the battery that is a problem (sometimes bad batteries can show as fully charged).  If it has the same problem with all batteries, then it is the charger."

915321,Dan668,2015-05-15 14:04:00,1120,"I have a similar issue, one battery out of my 3 is always charging, had the charger replaced under warranty (not because of the issue,  one of my leads melted) , same issue,  so its obviously the battery.  Doesnt make much sense though because after 6-8 hours of charging,  if i take a volt meter,  the one battery shows 12.69v (tested it 24 hours after), its only 2 years old."

That's what I was thinking too.  A Yellow flashing light means its charging in Bulk or Absorption mode.  Green means: Maintenance Mode.  From Minnkota:"
915326,NANUK,2015-05-15 15:15:00,797,"Check the water in battery, best to take it some where to be load tested and a specific gravity test on each cell. You can try a different charger or battery,  There is a reason I don't like leaving the automatic charger ON all the time ."
915334,Dan668,2015-05-15 16:19:00,1120,"My one bank stays flashing yellow,  i assumed thats why my lead melted. Water is full.  I dont think an equalizer will change anything.  I will prob bring it to be load tested."
915337,Lunkerhunter,2015-05-15 16:30:00,455,I have 2 optima blue tops hooked up to it. Both doing the same thing. And sorry I should have mentioned they are both flashing green. After a few days still flashing green not solid green like they normally do.  Batteries are one year old

After a few days still flashing green not solid green like they normally do.  Batteries are one year old  I would call Minnkota.  They have been excellent at answering my questions when I called.
915346,fishnsled,2015-05-15 17:32:00,3520,That is a bit strange Andrew. My charger did the same thing this spring but it did finally indicate a full charge after a couple of days.  My batteries were old (5-6 years) and I figured it was just the batteries on their way out.  I just replaced them with new ones and the charger worked fine. Might be best to contact Minn Kota.  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/Contact/ as manjo39 suggested to get the issue resolved quickly.
915347,Lunkerhunter,2015-05-15 17:45:00,455,Called minnkota advised me to plug back in and leave flashing green for at least 24 hours. If still flashing get the batteries tested. I will let you know.  They did advise flashing green was still a full charge but eventually it should shut off.
