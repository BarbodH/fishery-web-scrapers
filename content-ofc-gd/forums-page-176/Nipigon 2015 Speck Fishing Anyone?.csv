Last year we still had ice on the lake the first four days but managed some treacherous trolling between the ice pack and shore each day.  Next four days I unfortunately spent sick.  But despite all that we caught and released a number of keepers and added another of our group to the Two-Four Club (24"" or more).  This should be a much better trip this year."
