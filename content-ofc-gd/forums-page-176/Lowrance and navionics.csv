914145,shimano19,2015-05-07 17:35:00,196,I just recieved a lowrance HDS 5 gen 1 a few days ago. I put in a navionics hot maps in it. It will show lakes like scugog and others in great detail and contours but when I scroll over to buckhorn and pigeon lake it won't show depths and barley any detail. Any ideas? Also is there a way to upload my waypoints from my navionics chip to my new sonar?
914146,BillM,2015-05-07 17:44:00,17367,Sounds like some lakes are in 'HD' and others aren't.
914156,shimano19,2015-05-07 18:19:00,196,Is there a way to fix that? On my hummingbird all the lakes used to be detailed
914166,Dan668,2015-05-07 18:47:00,1120,Try selecting fish n chip in the menu
914168,kickingfrog,2015-05-07 18:54:00,8333,Ya when I switched lowrance the mapping was a pain compared to HB. I had to use the menu and select the area I was in to get the lake depth details.
914197,shimano19,2015-05-07 21:58:00,196,What do you mean kickinfrog? What part of the menu?
914200,kickingfrog,2015-05-07 22:11:00,8333,Since I've set it up I haven't had to do it again so I can't say for sure. But I think it was in the chart set-up and then select your area I think it is something like southern Ontario for what you need. Giant pain compared to humminbird.
914223,cowanjo,2015-05-07 23:44:00,249,menu - Chart options - turn on fishnchips - Pigeon should be detailed.
915105,shimano19,2015-05-14 00:18:00,196,"So I updated the software on the hds5 gen1, and still no lake depths for buckhorn and rice lake. There is a fish n chips option but it is not highlighted and dosent allow me to select it. Also I cannot find any selection for southern ontario. I only have options for lowrance or navionics charts. all other lakes have contours and depths."
915107,G.mech,2015-05-14 00:24:00,830,"I think Buckhorn, Rice and most of the Trent systems are only on the Gold card and won't show up on that chip....that's what sucks about the older Navionics chips.  The new Navionics +  chip has all the lakes with 1' contours (Fish'n Chip mode) throughout the entire area you choose to download."
915190,shimano19,2015-05-14 15:54:00,196,I see I can update my card for $99 on navionics but it says enjoy it for a year. Do the maps expire after a year or how does that work?
915196,kickingfrog,2015-05-14 16:11:00,8333, I think what it means is that for a year you can get any other updates that are made.
915198,BillM,2015-05-14 16:39:00,17367,"Free upgrades for a year, after that another $99."
915201,shimano19,2015-05-14 16:49:00,196,Okay cool and do I buy the update chip at a store or I can update it online?
915202,BillM,2015-05-14 16:49:00,17367,You update it online.
915203,shimano19,2015-05-14 16:50:00,196,Called navionics about the update. Thanks!
