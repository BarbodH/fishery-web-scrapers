915349,steelhunter,2015-05-15 18:06:00,81,Can I use this type of 50 amp fuse for my trolling motor The marinas sell the same ones but they are 15.99 and made by same company  http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/50a-6-to-24v-stud-type-circuit-breakers/A-p8198798e  Question 2 Would you just wire the positive wires coming and going
915350,misfish,2015-05-15 18:16:00,29133,"Why would you not install the inline one? The fuse pops,you just pull it and put in a new.???   http://www.go2marine.com/product/16208F/waterproof-in-line-fuse-holder-w-cover.html"
915353,steelhunter,2015-05-15 18:26:00,81,That unit automaticly resets its self no need for fuses
915354,misfish,2015-05-15 18:27:00,29133,"Ah ok. Never knew that. Thats cool.  If it,s the same then your gold I would say."
915377,G.mech,2015-05-15 21:36:00,830,Those work fine as long as they don't get drenched.   For that kind of money I'd grab a spare one too just in case.
915378,fishnsled,2015-05-15 21:37:00,3520,"Same one I have on my boat, put it on the positive wire.  Think I got mine at NAPA."
915383,Garnet,2015-05-15 22:13:00,2056,I use same one. If you have a problem just jump your wire to front post. Then you know if it's your breaker.
915385,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-15 22:22:00,10439,Same on my boat as well. Came that way from the manufacturer.
