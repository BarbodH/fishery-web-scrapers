The whole boat is built out of plate aluminum all hand welded from the skin to the sub structure. The flooring and interior was the crafted from more common materials with teak wood used for the accent pieces and paneling. The craft is a twin screw with (2) 318 Chrysler (240 HP each) engines and the transmissions are velvet drive. The back of the boats is set up for fishing and the front is available for sunbathing with the lower deck reserved for cat napping out of the sun. Being all structurally built the front deck as well as both of the roof sections will support a person with ease and most of the time cannonballs from the top deck are the name of the game.  Of all of the boats I have built or owned this one just needed the electronics updated the wood resurfaced the fluids changed and a few other repairs to make it one of the most perfect fitting boats for me on big water.

At minimum I really need about 4 or 5 different watercraft.  A nice drift boat for certain salmon and trout water. If I had the choice it would be a Pavati: http://www.pavatimarine.com/    For bigger salmon and trout waters a jet sled is needed. Many choices here but my favorite is the Predator by Willie Boats: http://www.willieboats.com/predator/    Then I will need a lake boat. I already have the one I like.    Gonna need an ocean boat when I move to BC as well. My choice here is a Kingfisher: http://www.kingfisherboats.com/off-shore/    I also have a kayak but my choice if I had the $$$$ would be a Hobi PA14: http://www.hobiefishing.com/mirage/mirage-pro-angler-14/

Not because I think it's the greatest boat out there, but it would be a beautiful clean slate to make an incredible custom boat that you could take fishing in the shallows one day, downrigging in rough waters the next day, and the next day use it for wakeboarding or tubing. That being said I'd need at least another 20k on top of the boat/motor cost to make it my own.  I'm not a huge fan of purpose built boats because they're very good at one thing and that's it. If it was a perfect world I'd have a stable with 3 or 4 different boats."

They took a brand new boat and then stripped it down and built it back up again.  They increased the size of the front deck, improve the storage, jacked up the performance and a bunch of other things.  It would be a sort of fun ""if I won the lottery"" type thing to think about while driving on a fishing trip. Although I realized pretty quickly that if money truly was no object then I'd have to have multiple boats to suit my multi species/locale fishing pursuits.  The cost of their project boat was over $100k. Not sure if that includes the cost of the new boat to begin with or not.  Even working with that type of budget I think I could go $60/$40k (maybe $35/$65) on 2 boats that would cover most of my current ""needs""."
