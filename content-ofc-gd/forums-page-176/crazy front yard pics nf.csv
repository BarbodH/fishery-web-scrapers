915096,manitoubass2,2015-05-13 22:43:00,11391,"Thats a big bear man. No way the dogs can take that on lol.  Most around here are smaller black bears.  Lew, the pic of the deer and our old cat is priceless, shes gone now. They played for a good half hour, touching noses numerous times. It was awesome to watch from the window. We didnt want to disturb them.  The top pic is of a few tornados trying to form over the pow wow grounds in RRFN a few years back. Boy was the mrs scared lol."
