915120,Joey,2015-05-14 01:39:00,9122,Anybody know anyone who works in the downtown area who can fix a washing machine?  My son's machine went on the fritz and we are selling his apartment soon and need to get it fixed ASAP.  Thanks.  Joey
915122,ketchenany,2015-05-14 01:58:00,3229,"Joey, sometimes it's best to buy another, parts and labour can add up and a new one is a good selling point. We had Paul on here on OFC that sells parts for appliances and I did repair my dryer once with his help. Some are not meant to be fixed,  our society has come to that.  Good luck"
915133,Joey,2015-05-14 03:08:00,9122,"Ya, I almost figured that.  It is only a small apartment sized washer/dryer stacked combo.   Can't be too much to replace as opposed to repaired.  Guess I'll look into both options.  Thanks"
915135,tender52,2015-05-14 03:18:00,270,"I saw you said ""fish""  did you mean snake?  If its plugged or the pump isnt working you can change the pump by yourself. give me a quick description what its doing.. or not"

915277,NANUK,2015-05-15 01:49:00,797,what make / model is it ? The reason I ask is we just bought a new washer and might be able to help you with some parts from the old washer before I scrap it.
