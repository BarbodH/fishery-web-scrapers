They seem like they have no short term power loss after being recovered. Question is will there be any problems long term ? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks. "

915284,irishfield,2015-05-15 02:40:00,26272,Forgot to put the drain plug in eh
915291,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-15 05:49:00,8243,Now who would ever forget the drain Plug? My wife forgot to put the drain plug in last fall and the battery is just fine. When I went to put a charge on it last month it still had 60% on it. No worry slidehammer.

915552,slidehammer,2015-05-18 03:30:00,28,"AHH no, not the drain plug.... left the livewell running at the dock and didn't close the hatch. It was pumping in more than draining..And I was in for a nice lunch and a nappy."
915553,irishfield,2015-05-18 03:39:00,26272,"Keep in mind... the specific gravity of the acid is higher than water, so water wouldn't have replaced the acid. It may however be worth popping the caps and making sure the level is still down at the fill rings before your next outing. If not use a syringe to lower the level."
