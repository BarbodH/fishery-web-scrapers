915312,adam lancia,2015-05-15 11:32:00,234,"LOL! Hopefully it won't come to that. I went down the the mouth of the Rouge at the end of Lawrence and didn't catch a thing yesterday afternoon. Perfect! I didn't get around to testing everything so I'll be going back there at some point soon. Thanks for all the suggestions guys, I really appreciate it!"
914467,adam lancia,2015-05-10 12:48:00,234,"Hi all, I realize this is probably a very unusual request... I'm looking for a place to test out a bunch of my new gear which was acquired in the great tackle monkey attack of late 2014/early 2015. The vast majority of my tackle is bass-focused and with the season opening up on over a month from now, I'd rather not take a chance on catching bass when I 1) don't want to, 2) they're OOS. So, is there anywhere within say a half hour drive of eastern Scarborough that definitely doesn't have any fish in it...? I was messing around on Google maps and saw a pond behind the Public Works yard at Morningside and the 401, is that private property or public, and is fishing allowed there?  In case I can't find somewhere to wet a line without hooking a fish, is there a good way to cast my lures without fear of hooking a fish? I know I can just remove the trebles from those lures, but what about my single hook baits like jigs and spinnerbaits...? Is there a reliable way to cap the hooks?  Thanks in advance!"
914469,Rizzo,2015-05-10 13:20:00,4754,"just follow my boat, never seem to be fish where I go"
914471,Paudash,2015-05-10 13:32:00,273,"I was going to say the same as Rizzo my only thing to add if you want to be really sure, follow me when I have entered a tournament then you are guaranteed to not to get a bite"

I know that pond.  I don't think that you are allowed there anymore.  You can try one of the piers at the end of Port Union Rd.  There are fish, but I don't think the chance of catching a bass if very high."
914479,Joeytier,2015-05-10 14:25:00,3990,Just go to a lake O Pier
914481,Roy,2015-05-10 14:47:00,13728,You must have a friend who has a swimming pool.
914483,Steve,2015-05-10 15:06:00,2075,swimming pool or lake ontario shoreline.
914484,Spiel,2015-05-10 15:11:00,9065,"I was going to say the same thing, follow Rizzo."
914494,Acountdeleted,2015-05-10 16:04:00,2562,Fish the marina at the Scarborough bluffs. At the boat launch you will catch zilch.
914496,OhioFisherman,2015-05-10 16:35:00,6623,Removing the trebles from a lure might throw off the balance and you won't get a clear idea of the lure's action.
914556,manitoubass2,2015-05-11 00:46:00,11391,Now watch him go hammer fish???
914569,adam lancia,2015-05-11 02:45:00,234,"Manitou, for the first time in my life, I hope you're wrong  Pains me to think it, let alone say it...  Thanks for the suggestions guys, sounds like a few options close to home.  Ohio: I was thinking about that as I typed, I'm looking to test my new reels and rods though so I wouldn't have been super concerned about lure action and the rest of that business."
914595,Garnet,2015-05-11 10:54:00,2056,Most bass tackle is pike tackle so I would go to Lake Ontario Pier. Just keep your cast short and you should see any bass before they are hooked.  I will be at Newcastle pier one day this week modifying a jerk bait for pike.
914599,aplumma,2015-05-11 11:42:00,6896,A small piece of bar straw will keep the fish from getting hooked. I carrya few clear ones so when my fishing buddy starts to catch more fish than me I just sneak on on his lure. I am not sure what the ruling for this is if the game warden see it though.   Art

If all you are looking to do is test the rods and reels put a clip on the end of the line and cast some various weight bell sinkers, an old jig with the hook cut off?"
914607,adam lancia,2015-05-11 13:40:00,234,"That's a great idea Art, maybe even some vinyl tubing would work.  Ohio, I thought of that too, but in a fit of boredom last week I has already tied lures onto all of the equipment I want to test :-\  Thanks again everyone!"
914991,adam lancia,2015-05-13 11:35:00,234,"What about up at the Rouge River Dam in Markham? It looks like there are a lot of easy-to-fish-from spots along there.  For those spots at Bluffers and the Port Union pier, should I be considering putting a heavy leader on in case a pike decides what I have tied on looks tasty...? If so, what should use for a leader? The heaviest I have is 15# Berkley fluorocarbon. Of course, if I accidentally catch a pike that'll mean a host of other issues since I don't have a net or a Boga grip, let alone any experience dealing with a tooth bugger like that..."
915024,muddler,2015-05-13 14:17:00,623,The Rouge rive at the end of Lawrence Ave has a shallow bay that has carp and bullheads. Never caught a pike or bass there. I've tested the action of my buzzbaits and spinner baits there  a lot of times when I lived in Scarborough years ago. The parking lot is a stones throw from the water. The water between the train bridge and Lake Ontario is usually free of fishermen and I have Never caught a thing there.

I don't think you are likely to catch a pike off the piers at Port Union Road.  If you do. please let me know.      You might get one by the boat launch at Bluffers."
915148,Joeytier,2015-05-14 07:04:00,3990,You're putting an awful lot of thought into something extremely simple lol.  Just go find a pier and cast away lol
915155,adam lancia,2015-05-14 11:44:00,234,"True, but only because I don't have time to get out yet. If that weren't the case, I'd be reporting back on my new equipment by now :-D"
915283,Smokercrafty,2015-05-15 02:35:00,227,Lmao.......  I feel the same some days!
915292,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-15 05:53:00,8243,Pee on the lure. If you do catch a Bass where there are no Bass please let me know. I won't buy another ounce of sent again.
