1049552,Harrybsfc,2019-09-10 14:59:00,7,Hi  guys I’m over from England and about to spend 2 nights in Owen sounds can anyone give me any areas near by where I may catch or find some decent size carp! Remember seeing some massive ones a few years ago when I was last here but they weren’t interested in being caught! Thanks Harry.
1049555,misfish,2019-09-10 15:20:00,29133,There are lots off the wall. MONSTERS. You can stand there and watch them. Same for the wall in Collingwood Harbour.
1049565,Harrybsfc,2019-09-10 19:22:00,7,And when you say off the wall where is that exactly??
1049569,Headhunter,2019-09-10 20:49:00,5703,I believe that he would be referring to the pier jutting out into the lake. Happy Carp'in! HH
1049570,misfish,2019-09-10 21:04:00,29133,Right in the channel. You will see guys chucking for salmon now. Across from the silos.
1049573,Harrybsfc,2019-09-10 21:33:00,7,yeah I’m there now no carp yet but someone lost a salmon!
1049604,Mike Pike,2019-09-11 19:26:00,1332,"Here in Hamilton, we have a carp wall in the harbour too.  Unfortunately, they're reinforcing in now so it's fenced off.  Very sad as I don't know how long the work will take and this is an awesome time to fish it. But anyhow, even though the depth was over 20 feet, putting down some chum and fishing bolt rigged as you would carp fish anywhere worked a charm for us. Good luck Harry! "
