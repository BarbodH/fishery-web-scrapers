1049133,Fez,2019-08-31 13:07:00,1,Anyone have any tips or hot spots for salmon on the Nottawasaga ? I’ve tried the fishing park in angus but it gets too crowded. Thanks!
1049135,lew,2019-08-31 13:50:00,12766,"Sorry, but you'll probably find nobody on this board will post hotspots to anyone, specially someone with a 1st post and not even an introduction. Nothing personal against you, just the way things are."
1049150,J Roelofsen,2019-08-31 19:07:00,84,"Interesting approach. I'm thinking that looking for quiet spots by asking about them on a large open forum would be quite counter productive.. The most successful Salmon and Trout anglers are very good at exploring, finding their own water and keeping their mouth shut ? Josh"

1049154,ketchenany,2019-08-31 20:25:00,3229,But you post pictures of dead grass or rocks with a fish. I can tell you where to find tomatoes this weekend!
1049155,misfish,2019-08-31 20:33:00,29133,"I have seen more tomatoes today then I need to.  . I went to 4 stores. No shepherds. ?  I did see frozen steelhead fillets. One side , thin sliced,25 bucks. LOL"
1049156,ketchenany,2019-08-31 21:33:00,3229,"Every garage door is UP in woody this weekend!  keep your shorts on the  peppers, I’ll let you know when they are ready. Meanwhile, fish the Notty and post grass/rock pictures. And help Terry with the truck."
1049158,misfish,2019-08-31 21:43:00,29133,Who ??
1049160,ketchenany,2019-08-31 21:52:00,3229,"Terry, the guy who gets up late and knows the Notty like the back of his hand. he knows Salmon fishing spots, takes rock/grass pictures better than you. You never take him, he would show you his spots!  "
1049215,misfish,2019-09-02 13:57:00,29133,"1st trip out this  fall. Get there well before anyone see,s you walking in. Had a couple of hours this morning. 2nd toss, this one smoked a Mepps spinner. Perfect eater size.  "
1049216,Fisherman,2019-09-02 14:11:00,7201,Nice one.
1049217,ketchenany,2019-09-02 14:14:00,3229,I knew that was coming lol. I told you so!
1049218,lew,2019-09-02 14:41:00,12766,Your sure livin the life my friend !!
1049219,Terry,2019-09-02 14:45:00,14456,Nice fish 
1049220,misfish,2019-09-02 15:07:00,29133,"To be fair here Fez, you did ask a loaded question. Tips, some will give, SPOTS, aint going to happen. I have lived up here for over 25 years. I walked and trench through 100,s of miles of bush to find spots. Alone, and with good friends. Will I share these spots? Yes, but with only true loyal friends. Get yer boots on and get marching. Never know, you might find that one spot. Good fishing to you.  "

1049223,misfish,2019-09-02 15:30:00,29133,Wrong spot. That is the other spot. LOL
1049252,Rustic-Fisher,2019-09-02 23:22:00,826,Tell me you smoked that fish using the SS whisker lol!!!
