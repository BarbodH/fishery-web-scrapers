1048847,BillM,2019-08-27 01:34:00,17367,"Nick, I always keep an eye open for used Shimano Sustain FEs..   To me you aren't going to find a better reel for the price.   I've got 2 now, a 1000 and a 3000.   Kijiji and Ebay"
1048866,NAW,2019-08-27 16:12:00,4022,"i got a line on a new Stradic 1000 FK for $209 new from a store.  I fish mostly for walleye and pike.  Sometime pan fish.  Nothing really big anyways. 2. questions.  1.  is the FK model any good?    I can't really find a good breakdown of their models online. 2.  Will the 1000 be big enough?  The guy at the store said there is only about 20 yards difference in the line capacity.  I don't like heavy reels.  I have tendinitis in my elbow and arthritis in my wrist.    So if I can get a way with a 1000, that would be perfect.  Thoughts?"

1048872,Duckie,2019-08-27 17:38:00,305,the FKs are fantastic. i have a 3000 size. the new FL is essentially the same reel but with a long stroke spool.
1048873,Dan668,2019-08-27 17:48:00,1120,"I am a fan of 2500/3000 size reels. Less line twist issues. And in most cases on the rods I am using, have better balance and feel. I always recommend the Daiwa BG to friends, they love them. And so far have held up. Although, this reel doesn't have that nice air bail. Need to move up a model. Shimano makes great reels, i have a few Vanquish C3000's. I am a fan of Daiwa's though as i love the airbail. Not a fan of the thin bails, for whatever reason lol. But if you don't mind em, the Stradic is a great reel. A bit over your budget though. The pflueger president is a good option on a budget. That's what I buy for my Dad, he doesn't take care of any gear and most are almost ten years old and still kicking. "
1048880,Lape0019,2019-08-27 19:39:00,647,"Alright, I think you have a good handle on what is being said here but I guess I will reiterate. 1. Give Paddletales in Winchester a call and see if he has any FK's left in the 2500 size. He will ship if you ask.  I know he did the last time I was there but he has them on sale as a new model is coming out. So now would be a perfect time to buy a new FK. I would also not even attempt to fish pike with a 1000 size reel but I do not jig. I am usually casting. For dropshotting, it might work alreat but I prefer 2500-3000 sized reels. 2. If you are worried abut weight, look into the CI4+ stradic instead of the FK. Even used. You can always send it to shimano and they will replace any worn our parts and service it for around $30. 3. I will not touch a quantum reel. I have a Pflueger President and would be willing to bet you would not find it any better than what you currently have. Good reel for the price, but better options out there for a bit more money, My dad has a magnesium supreme and it has been a great reel for him. 4. in your price range, the BG and other Daiwa reel that Smitty recommended are actually great options. I never fished the BG but man was I impressed with it at the store (I tell people this type of information to make it know I have not used the reel.). It felt great! I just don't know how long that would last. And the tournament SS has been around forever for a reason. 5. I am a Shimano guy so I would lean towards a Nasci if you absolutely do not want to spend more than $150. IMO, You will never regret buying a stradic though. No matter which model."

1048897,porkpie,2019-08-27 22:49:00,2521,"What do you mainly fish for?  Salmon, then no it’s not nearly enough.  If you fish for walleye bass and occasionally pike and use braid, it’s plenty.  All of my spinning reels are 1000 size these days, with the exception of those I use for salmon and steelhead.  I own a couple 1000 size Stradics and not once have I had an issue with line capacity and I actually prefer the more compact lighter reels. I’d go for it."
1048907,Moosebunk,2019-08-28 03:20:00,3970,"Stradics taxes in are like pushing $300.  So $209 ain't bad but it is a 1000.  You'd have better versatility here and a stronger drag on a 2500 to 3000.  The 1000 for pike and lakers is better suited to ice fishing, you'd wear it out too quick for serious lakers and pike. Symetre are obviously out and the last few years they were making them they turned 'em into junk.  I own eight and the last two stood up to nothing.  Once upon a time they were workhorses and my oldest in the bunch are the ones still working best.  Put those through Hell a thousand times over.  So like you, I look around this price range and right now Shimano has the Nasci.  Four SAIL store employees recommended this over the Quantum Smoke which had been marked down to close to the same price.  I just put a 3000 Nasci to the first tests on arctic char and a 4000 on lakers.  They started rough at the reel handle, like a slight little burr every third crank or so, but that's smoothing out a little now.  If these reels fail I'll likely quit with Shimano awhile and move to Pfleuger or other options, but so far they seem OK. The Pleuger Patriarch is usually $269 but it's marked down to $149 at SAIL this week."
1048916,AKRISONER,2019-08-28 13:29:00,5558,these reels have literally gone to complete trash. Ive seen two purchased brand new this year have their drag systems completely fail.
1048918,JoshS,2019-08-28 14:12:00,729,I have a few older stradics and the older green symetre. Haven't had to consider a new reel in a long time! Solid reels. I'd get 3000 size so it's more versatile for you.
1048919,Moosebunk,2019-08-28 14:13:00,3970,"Sad.  One of the best 1000 series reels I had, for a good while was that Quantum PT with all the rainbow colors on it. It was the last two Symetres that both failed. One basically within weeks, the other months. Shimano took 'em in, supposedly fixed some faulty part, gave 'em back and one was done within the year. The other sees lighter use.  Anyways, for what they are, paying $150 you'd expect better than a season or two out of them."
1048926,NAW,2019-08-28 19:15:00,4022,"I have a Symetre that's about 10 years old (the green one).  It seizes up randomly, and I can't seem to find out how to fix it.   I tear it apart, and grease everything.  It works for a few times out, then starts seizing again.    Maybe worth taking to rocky's or somewhere to have a professional look at it.   Not sure how much they charge though.   I always assumed more then what the reel is worth in it's current state."
1048955,smitty55,2019-08-29 01:57:00,928,"You may be surprised, a lot of cleaning and repairs are like $30 from what I've heard."
1048966,J Roelofsen,2019-08-29 05:35:00,84,"If your used to doing your own maintenance then the Pfluegers can't be beat IMO. They are a very simple design and that's a good thing IMO. A little grease once a season and theyre good to go. If you want a bargain reel thats has the feel of much more expensive models have a look at the Okuma Ceymar. My local shop owner turned me onto them and I've beat the living snot out of a couple of them (size 30 and 40) for 3 seasons now without a stutter.....the one is used for chucking hardware for Steelies and Salmon and gets booted around the boat, dragged through the mud, dunked and frozen....no problems whatsoever for $60 they are a bargain! I've also picked up the giant 65 size for a lender when passengers would prefer a spinning reel for musky and a few of the 10 and 20 sizes to replace Siennas for ice fishing. Josh"
1048978,David Chong,2019-08-29 12:38:00,836,I use a bunch of them & I believe that the Daiwa Fuego LT is the best spinning reel for under $150! I do believe that they retail for about $130-140

All of the being said, I have a birthday in October, and have decided to ask the family for no presents, just cash this year.  A good chunk of that money is going to a new reel.  I was looking in to used Stradics, because I have always liked them.  But I notice they have Quantum rod and reel combos for sale at CT right now.  I really have no brand loyalty when it comes to fishing gear.    Does Quantum make decent high end reels?  Does anyone have suggestions for be best quality reel I can get for $150?

1048759,porkpie,2019-08-24 13:49:00,2521,I don’t vary much from shimano or Daiwa when it comes to reels.  I’ve owned most other brands over the years and been disappointed by a number of them.  I don’t buy quantum stuff. I had a couple of iron horse casting reels years ago and both failed on me.  Fixed at aikmans and sold them.  Your mileage may vary.  I’ve been pretty happy even with the cheap shimano siennas that I use ice fishing and on my kids rods.  They hold up pretty well for a $50 reel.  Have a couple cheaper Daiwa spinning reels and they seem to keep on ticking as well.  A Stradic is a pretty nice reel!
1048766,GBW,2019-08-24 14:31:00,8460,I have to say that I don't deviate from Shimano reels and when I did it was Ardent (Blew the drag up on day 1 for $100 reel).  Yes I have a Phluger (willing to sell it) and have had Diawa and Quantum but me I will stick with Shimano.  Quality to me and warranty and local service to me is why.  Not a brand _hore...

My buddies have a penchant for messing around and trying to find cheaper deals. theyve used everything from Lews, Diawa, Abu Garcia, Pfleuger, Quantum and shimano. My one buddy recently bought the Quantum smoke on a recommendation from my other friend who says its great...they are piece of garbage. Dont bother. Dave said he really likes his, so jake bought one because they were on sale (like you are seeing) sure enough after 2 months the things drag is totally failing. Dave claims that his is great, but now his is broken too. The lews...dont waste your time they failed as well. (im a fan of their baitcasters though) Daves a huge fan of the new Diawa spinning reels, but they just came out on the market so theres no telling about their longevity. The guys have always been a fan of the pfleuger reels. They seem to be a decent low price option. Not sure Id drop a lot of money on one though? They seem to hold up over time though. Ive owned, and still own a couple of Abu Reels. They seem to hold up, the revo SX I had back in the day is still kicking. I sold it to a buddy of mine, its held up for 10 years! Then you come to shimano, and specifically the stradic. I have slowly been acquiring stradics to fill out my arsenal over the years, Ive got a 3000fi, a 3000fj and 3 Ci4+s The worst thing that has happened is that the 3000fi which is an absolute work horse for me, its bail spring evenually failed. I also then noticed recently it was grinding a bit on retrieve so i cleaned it out and greased it. Other than that, not a single one has failed on me, the drags on all of them is absolutely bulletproof, and furthermore the stradics drag system in general is one of the smoothest most consistent and adjustable drag systems I have ever used. So my reco? Go with a stradic and never look back. Clean em out every so often and youll have an incredible reel that will last you for the next 20+ years. This is coming from a guy who is on the water fishing his reels over 300 hours a year."
