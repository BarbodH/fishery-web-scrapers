1049726,irishfield,2019-09-15 01:25:00,26272,"NICE, glad to see you kept them and ate them appropriately... not wasted like this 42""r that I found under my dock in July ! The biggest pike I've every seen on TMag, that someone decided to waste. You didn't try to play on my slide.. did you.. LOL "
1049727,japper,2019-09-15 01:33:00,31,"Only kept 1 (and that’s because the Rapala got stuck in its gills), the othesr are still swimming.......... What’s that about the slide??????? "
1049728,irishfield,2019-09-15 01:39:00,26272,I assumed with them all on stringers you ate them all. If you camp at the park.. you'd know what I was referring to as per the slide...
1049729,japper,2019-09-15 01:44:00,31,"Haha, right across from Finlayson. Ya, I know it. The big blue one! So I guess the big pike I got is now the biggest you’ve ever seen from the lake ?"
1049730,japper,2019-09-15 01:49:00,31,"Looking at your user name, you know anything about that plane with the clover on the tail?????? I didn’t see it there the 3 times I was up there....."
1049736,irishfield,2019-09-15 02:43:00,26272,There's no big blue slide up there! It's White all 175' of it! ... Plane is mine.. it's been a busy Summer. I was there for a week in July and three in August.  
1049754,muskybw,2019-09-15 19:12:00,116,"GREAT PICS, thanks for the share !"
1049767,irishfield,2019-09-16 03:58:00,26272,"I'm gonna be a ""dick"" and gotta ask, if you aren't keeping them.. why are they all on a stringer? When did you catch the Pike in picture number three?"
1049783,japper,2019-09-16 15:25:00,31,"Because, I fish by myself. So, I put the fish on the stringer while I set up my camera for a picture, that way fish spends as little time as possible in the boat."
1049784,japper,2019-09-16 15:34:00,31,"Got the big one last Thursday, around 2pm. thought slide was blue for some reason ?‍♂️"
1049795,Headhunter,2019-09-16 20:06:00,5703,"I think that what Irish is leading towards is that it is generally seen as bad practice to hold large pike/musky by the mouth, without supporting the rest of the body. Bad things can happen unintentionally when the fish's weight in not being supported. That said, nice fishes! HH"
