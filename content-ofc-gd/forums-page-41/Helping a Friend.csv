Thank you.  STOLEN MUSKIE BAITS *******$1000 reward******* Wishmaster Wish Dark Walleye Hosebaits Bluewater Baits Elzinga Baits Rennie Baits Perchbaits  Stolen from my boat was a musky monster box and a 5 gallon pail rimmed with custom muskie baits. This happened between the hours of 9:00 pm and 6:30 am on Sunday evening August 31st into the morning of September 1st 2019 at Rock Pine Resort in Pointe Au Baril, Ontario. I am offering up a $1000 reward for the return of the baits that are listed below. Please keep comments in good nature, yes I probably shouldn’t have left them in the boat, but I have learned a hard lesson that will never be repeated. Let this be a lesson learned for everyone to take your stuff out of your boat for the evening. A lot of these baits are one off patterns made by Hoser, Lidio and Steve and have a been run hard with a lot of lip wear and hook rash present. Most importantly to me is they have history and most with a good story to tell. I would definitely like to see them returned to me and that’s why I have offered up a reward. Below is a list of what was taken to my best recollection but I am sure I am missing 5-10 baits and cannot recall everyone that was in the box.
