1049070,lew,2019-08-30 13:58:00,12766,"What if O'Leary had a few drinks with his friends and was doing the responsible thing and letting his wife drive the boat, or is that too hard to imagine ? "
1049072,Squid,2019-08-30 14:07:00,1656,That's quite possible. We won't know until the investigation is complete and even then it may not be all factual.
1049073,Squid,2019-08-30 14:09:00,1656,Maybe to you mister g. Anyways condolences to the families affected by the trauma and loss.
1049090,Snidley,2019-08-30 17:37:00,620,"On many occasions I let my girlfriend drive if I had been drinking. O'Leary is a wine buff so it is not out of the question that he let his wife drive home, assuming she was not drinking, which the breath analizer confirmed. This would be sensible, responsible and therefore could have been the case. Personally I find O'Leary unbearable as a tv personality but that is not a crime (but maybe it should be, lol)"
1049092,dave524,2019-08-30 17:46:00,4508,"I let mine drive all the time, I enjoy the peace and quiet ?"
1049145,misfish,2019-08-31 16:31:00,29133,"I had a 14 ft tinny go by me this morning with NO LIGHTS at all. I have it on video. I am not going to post it yet, as it is part of my weekend project video."
1049149,cisco,2019-08-31 18:25:00,597,If a boat has no running lights when out there in the dark I find it hard to think a power boat hitting it is an unexpected thing. To me it is a tragedy waiting to happen. Driver may have even been distracted by cellphone or ? But the police will determine things.
1049151,wkrp,2019-08-31 19:11:00,656,Your vision is all you have out on the water as your engine quells the sound of the other boat. Pretty scary stuff.My condolences to all affected by this tradegy.
1049152,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-31 19:13:00,8243,Exactly. Just because the guy isn't liked doesn't mean he is guilty of something. Let the investigation run it's course before we sentence anyone.
1049180,woodenboater,2019-09-01 12:47:00,2277,"Agree, but we shouldn't presume that his recollection of the event is accurate as well. If he was sauced, and letting his wife or whomever drive the boat, then perhaps he may be wrong as he may not have been watching ? Also, reports say that he hasn't confirmed who was driving his boat. I trust the police will handle this with a blind eye."
1049182,fish_fishburn,2019-09-01 13:36:00,1311,"Lots of salty dogs on here. I think your jealous that he is probably way more successful then yourself or has a different political view. Just saying, ease up."
1049183,glen,2019-09-01 14:27:00,2641,Or maybe they are saying odds are this is what might have happened. Lots of times we get part of a story. Too much delay in the truth coming out.  The truth might never come out.  Especially when someone has enough money to pay to keep mouths shut. What was the whole story when two guys hid in Manitoba?
1049184,lew,2019-09-01 14:44:00,12766,This post has become unbelievable.
1049185,Ronzo,2019-09-01 14:53:00,124,"My brother works up in that area, he said the water's been too rough and it's been too windy for accident reconstruction and full investigation (as of a couple days ago)."
1049186,SirCranksalot,2019-09-01 15:54:00,3291,No O'leary fan here either but let's not hang him w/o a fair trial. 
1049187,aplumma,2019-09-01 16:13:00,6896,I see this is not going to get better. Art
1048911,Squid,2019-08-28 11:13:00,1656,I read that his wife ran over a boat in lake st joseph with O'Leary as a passenger?? Person was killed.
1048912,Terry,2019-08-28 11:19:00,14456,
1048914,SmokestackLightnin,2019-08-28 12:33:00,390,"Very sorry that a life was lost.  I think his quote would have been more compassionate if he left out the first sentence and started with ""Out of respect..."""
1048942,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-28 23:56:00,8243,"Sad. What is supposed to be recreation often turns to tragedy in a second. CHCH News tonight reported the boat that came into contact with O'Leary's did not have running lights and left the scene. Also that it was O'Leary's wife piloting their boat. Also O'Leary's wife had a breathalyser test and had zero alcohol in her system. The 1st sentence of his statement did say ""Out of respect....."""
1048950,chris.brock,2019-08-29 01:06:00,4053,"bull crap O'Leary's wife was driving the boat, I hope he gets what he deserves and can't buy his way out of it 2 people are now dead, very sad and tragic"
1048963,woodenboater,2019-08-29 03:34:00,2277,"His statement sounds like pr damage control to get ahead of the story and set the narrative. Police says other boat went elsewhere and called 911. If I was operating a boat that had severely injured people, I sure as hell wouldn't stick around, I'd be hauling ass to the nearest dock. I think there's more to this story. If it's a local (which it sounds like) and it's Lake Joe, I can't see them running without nav lights. will be watching to see how this develops"
1048965,porkpie,2019-08-29 04:50:00,2521,"Definitely getting out ahead of story.  Running lights?  I’ve seen many a nighttime booze cruise on our cottage lake chugging along in an unlit pontoon, so who can say.  Wife driving?  Maybe, maybe not.  Time will tell."
1048971,singingdog,2019-08-29 12:05:00,1047, ?
1048973,lew,2019-08-29 12:18:00,12766,"Agreed 100% As far as who's to blame, maybe we should let the police determine that."
1048976,David Chong,2019-08-29 12:30:00,836,"Wow, deadly boating accidents at night on Stoney Lake and Lake Joseph! Sad & crazy stuff! Will interesting to find out the full details of both incidents! On the water safety is critical! Be safe out there!"
1048985,woodenboater,2019-08-29 13:37:00,2277,"Also wondering if anyone on the larger craft saw the O'Leary boat coming at them, and did they have time to sound a horn. Did they give O'Leary a breathalyzer as well ? Guess they're not going to finger print the wheel to see who was driving their boat. So many questions. Will be following this story closely."
1048987,jimmer,2019-08-29 14:09:00,2730,So many unknowns at this point.  Hopefully the police pull out the truth. Always sad when someone loses their life while enjoying the outdoors.
1048988,Sinker,2019-08-29 14:17:00,8692,My first thought as well.
1048998,Toronto_Angler,2019-08-29 15:54:00,698,Pretty out of line to make a statement like that if you weren't there.
1049002,Fisherman,2019-08-29 16:37:00,7201,A lot of finger pointing and exclamations of guilty before being investigated.
1049031,Rizzo,2019-08-29 23:16:00,4754,"I am not saying she wasn't driving...but if I am in the boat, I am behind the wheel 100% of the time, not my wife. I imagine most (all?) of us are the same...especially boating after dark."
1049051,Duckie,2019-08-30 01:47:00,305,maybe so but I always thought the super rich always had drivers for just about everything?? ie someone else can drive while I relax.
1049054,kickingfrog,2019-08-30 02:49:00,8333,Terrible avoidable accident. The court of public opinion is very different than the actual courts. The court system would never consider that Mr. O'Leary sure seems like he'd be the type to sit back while his wife drives a boat at night.
1049057,Squid,2019-08-30 11:15:00,1656,It's fun to point fingers at a man like O'Leary.
1049060,Mister G,2019-08-30 12:06:00,1429,Most ignorant post so far.........
1049061,John,2019-08-30 12:48:00,2956,"I don't get these threads, sorry guys, but there is only one way that this thread is going."
1049062,lew,2019-08-30 12:50:00,12766,"It started going that way 2 days ago John, unfortunately"
1049063,Squid,2019-08-30 12:52:00,1656,Sorry for insulting you. He is not a favorite of mine so I really don't care for this man.
1049064,glen,2019-08-30 12:57:00,2641,I believe it is ok to speculate because it takes too long for info to come out.   The info that comes out may not be true.  Reasonable possibility is considered by everyone.  But do it politely.
1049066,misfish,2019-08-30 13:21:00,29133,I don't even let mine drive my truck.
