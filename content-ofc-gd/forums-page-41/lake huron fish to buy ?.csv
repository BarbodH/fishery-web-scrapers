1049281,Rod Caster,2019-09-03 14:25:00,5784,"Well I'll be chubbed, it's a real thing. Didn't know until today. "
1049294,muskybw,2019-09-03 19:36:00,116,"thanks, great pic ! they are delicious, but you can't eat one, you eat the whole bag ! we use 2 buy them 25yrs. ago at Denny's Dam, a native guy in an old pick up use 2 come down 2 the flats with little bags of these smoked chub, 5 in a bag, 2 or 3 dollars each. he said they came from lake Huron ? i have been looking for these for the last 5 yrs. ?"
1049588,ohgr696,2019-09-11 13:30:00,3,And here I have been throwing back unwanted chubs I've caught for years lol who knew!? I'll have to try this on my smoker.
1049595,OhioFisherman,2019-09-11 16:47:00,6623,"If it is any help,   https://www.interlochenpublicradio.org/post/chub-fishery-disappearing This is from the American side of the Great Lakes, but I assume the effect covers both sides? "" The number of chubs has decreased more than 99 percent in the past 20 years. "" That will make them harder to find? https://eatwisconsinfish.org/fish-list/chubs/"
1049600,ohgr696,2019-09-11 17:08:00,3,Well we get alot of chubs while river fishing for migrating and resident trout here in Southern Ontario. I am unsure of the commercial fishery for it on our side in Canada. But you can find as many as you want to fill a smoker within creeks and rivers here.
1049605,J Roelofsen,2019-09-11 22:04:00,84,Smoked Chub are not actually Chub that you would catch in SW Ontario rivers and creeks. They're a deep water Cisco species called Bloater ? I wouldnt recommend filling your smoker with common Creek Chub! Lol Josh
1049606,dave524,2019-09-11 22:15:00,4508,"At one time I'd take a light weight fly outfit to the Grand and catch Mooneyes, June was the month I recall. It was actually a popular event with local fly guys and I recall a few of them got smoked, very similar fish. "
1049607,OhioFisherman,2019-09-11 23:54:00,6623," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coregonus_hoyi Lots of chubs in our streams and rivers too, but J has it right a different species than them, and a much different look. Many years ago I went to buy some minnows at a bait store in PAB, in the mix of big minnows and chubs was was a mooneye, never had seen one before and I passed on it even though it looked good for bait, just didn't know if it was legal for bait, and I didn't have much confidence if they did either."
1049608,muskybw,2019-09-12 00:09:00,116,"that was great replies guys, i heard they are a dying breed, i know you wouldn't like river chub, the good eaters are J Roelofsen proven, bloaters !  i heard lake Michigan has them in some numbers, GRAND RAPIDS MI. sells them, over a 2 hr. drive from Windsor ?"
1049609,ohgr696,2019-09-12 00:18:00,3,Definitely good to know lol. In all honesty I probably wouldn't have done it anyway but I have thought about keeping them for cut bait.  Weird season going on in my local rivers here. Holes that are usually teaming with trout are filled up with chub. Can't wait for November rain ?steelhead times coming!
