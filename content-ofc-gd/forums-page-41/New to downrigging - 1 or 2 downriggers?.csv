1049265,tdelam,2019-09-03 01:46:00,2,New to downrigging here. My buddy took me out and loved it! I fish where depths change quickly; 60-130 feet. I was thinking of getting just one electric downrigger and stacking 2 rods or would you guys suggest 2 downriggers and I run to both of them to adjust the depths as they change? This sounds like a lot of work lol. Suggestions?
1049270,BillM,2019-09-03 02:50:00,17367,Running stackers is a pain in the ass.   I run two Scotty 1116s I don't think I'd ever go back to a single rigger.  Gotta keep an eye on those depths
1049284,LeXXington,2019-09-03 15:44:00,1928,"You can use just one rigger but it would be a pain to use stackers. Get 2 if you can, if not use one rigger and the other a dipsy"
1049286,OhioFisherman,2019-09-03 16:03:00,6623,"Never used one myself, one of my brothers was big into Salmon and Trout fishing on Lake Ontario and following the Walleye migration here on Lake Erie had two on his boat, both electric.  "
1049312,Pigeontroller,2019-09-03 23:34:00,2793,2 riggers is the way to go.
1049314,Canuck,2019-09-03 23:47:00,491,Two riggers on Lake Ontario for sure. You can run two rods per angler so with two riggers and two people you can run 4 rods.  Two on the balls and two stackers. Then add a couple of cheaters and you really cover some water. But you risk a big tangled mess if you hook a big screamer.
1049315,huzzsaba,2019-09-03 23:53:00,884,"I have gone out with my friend a few times and from my limited experience, I would say buy 2 good quality downriggers (manual is fine) and have line counters on the reels. Keep it simple. once you get the hang of 2, then add one line down the middle with an inline weight which will take the lure down 15-20 feet.  you will get some rainbows on that line or any other fish swimming higher up."
1049316,irishfield,2019-09-03 23:57:00,26272,Run 4... it's a lot of fun on Temagami when the charted 140FOW becomes 18 in a boat length... LOL 
1049321,porkpie,2019-09-04 02:14:00,2521,"I would run 2 riggers, it’ widens your spread, offers more versatility and you can stack 4 when it’s a rigger bite.  That said, it’s not at all a pain to stack with the right gear.  I use Scotty’s with longline clips and it’s pretty simple, you just have to remember you stacked when you hit the up switch.  You’ll want a couple of wire dipseys as well eventually!"
1049323,BillM,2019-09-04 02:45:00,17367,"Autostop beads before the stackers would probably help any potential accidents, lol."
1049334,tdelam,2019-09-04 13:04:00,2,"well, after chatting with my Dad who used to downrig a lot. He suggested 1 downrigger given the depth changes on the lake where my camp is. I am on Lake Manitou and the depths change from 130 to 80 to 60 very quickly. I was downrigging with a friend last weekend and we each had a rigger set up with a dipsy diver for shallower possibilities and we were constantly raising and lowering the ball with the depth changes. I decided to go with 1 Scotty stacked and a dipsy diver for now. I'm going to give it a try for a bit and see how I do. If I need/want another i'll buy it.  Thanks for the feedback guys!"
1049348,BillM,2019-09-04 18:02:00,17367,Goodluck!  Scotty makes a great rigger.
1049397,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-05 22:14:00,10439,My lake changes quickly as well. Quite often when I'm trolling the drop I get a little shallow and drag bottom.
1049439,smitty55,2019-09-07 02:30:00,928,"If you want an alternative or a cheap back up for your dipsy that is small, light and adjustable down to 80ft, and can also be used with a side planer to widen the spread you should take a look at the Davis Instruments Fish Seeker. It's a small acrylic fully adjustable diver meant for light line down to 6lb. Even on back lake trout fishing it's an easy way to get your lure down and real easy to change as you search for the right depth, specially mid summer. https://www.davisinstruments.com/product/fish-seeker-clear/  Cheers "
1049440,smitty55,2019-09-07 02:54:00,928,"I wouldn't say quite often but that sounds just like me dragging big gang trolls for Lakers with leadcore or copper. I'm generally targeting structure and I like to be close so if I tap bottom the odd time then I know I'm right where I want to be and sometimes it triggers strikes too. Even when the thermocline sets up I still prefer structure to wide open big water. Speaking of which Dave, I guess Great Slave doesn't stratify? 	Cheers"
1049441,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-07 03:04:00,10439,"Nope, summer isn't long or hot enough for that. No stratification on most lakes here. Just follow the bait."
1049455,Sinker,2019-09-07 16:19:00,8692,Check out the offshore tadpoles. They also work really good on light gear for getting deep.  S.
