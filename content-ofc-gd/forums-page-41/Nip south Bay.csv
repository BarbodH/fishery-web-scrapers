1049656,brkygetr,2019-09-12 20:51:00,425,Heading up tomorrow for the weekend to stay at Bear Creek cottages for the weekend. Anyone been this time of year? We are just going to have some fun and look for some walleye. Going to be a treat to have an actual cabin to stay in for once!!! Fall is my favorite time for walleye and should be interesting as I have never fished Nip before. Let me know if you are in the know.. Dale

The Donavan's ran it then young Dan took it over. I hear it sold. I taught little Danny how to catch a Football. This time of year we found it tough to find Walleye. Usually fished South Bay  for Pike especially if the wind was blowing. My favorite cottage at Bear Creek  was the Rock Cottage. We always had a huge Thanksgiving there and a few couples rented the Rock Cottage so I didn't have to sleep in the truck, alone. That area is so beautiful my ex tells me many of the cousins moved to the area after retirement, a few earlier."
