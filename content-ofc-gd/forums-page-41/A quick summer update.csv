Also caught it on a brand new Storm 360 search bait - like literally out of the package and 3 casts - score again  The next morning I was mainly being the kids fishing assistant  - one of them yelled that a big ""scary fish"" just swam under the dock.   I quickly grabbed my rod that had a wacky rigged worm on it and jigged it on the deep side of the dock and hooked into a nice pike  Anyway - all in all a great couple of catches to tide me over and if there is something memorable about my maiden kayak fish this weekend will update as well  On another note -my group has confirmed our plan and outfitter for 2020 - we are going with Slate Falls Outposts to their Miniss West cabin at the end of August - first planning session in the books last night and the juices are flowing Cheers and thanks for reading Gordy"
