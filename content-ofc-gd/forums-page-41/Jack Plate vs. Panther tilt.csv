1049544,floater,2019-09-10 12:40:00,220,I just wrecked my control box on my Panther Model 40 tilt unit. I'm looking at a jack plate now to replace it. I have a 30 Yamaha on a 14 foot deep and wide tin boat. Would the Jack Plate raise the bow a bit like the Panther? or is it for just running in shallow water? I used the boat without the Panther and the front really plows with one other person on board sitting in the middle. The motor is tilted back to second last hole.
1049559,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-10 17:04:00,10439,Just for running shallow water floater. I run a jack plate on my boat and it works in concert with my power trim to run super shallow and it also increases performance while running as I can lift my motor higher to reduce drag from the lower unit. 
1049560,floater,2019-09-10 17:09:00,220,Thanks for the info. I actually found a new control unit on Amaz.... I guess i'm just going to fix the Panther and re-install it. I like the way I can smooth out the ride. Thanks again.
