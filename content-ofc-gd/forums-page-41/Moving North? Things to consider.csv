I can get to Muskoka to fish as a day trip summer and winter. We can get on the 400 quite easily well above most of the traffic. River fishing spring and fall, down rigging in summer if you are into that. The whole area from Midland to C'wood offers similar advantages."

In the close to 15 years up there I have never seen anything like it. The seasons seemed to blend into each other as well. I remember one day, if you were in the shade you were swarmed by blackflied and mosquitos, if you stepped into the sun you got swarmed by deer flies. One particular day in july it was calm hot and sunny, I tried to take my dog for his walk and we had to call it quits. He had a swarm of about 40 deer flies clouding him and continuously biting him on his underside and nose. Heres a clip from blackfly season, mind the language! "

I now live about 10 kilometres from the nearest town on a 1 acre lot. I'm on Septic and well and havent spent much over the last 8 years. I have pumped the septic once and haven't had any issues with my well. The nice thing is that there really are very little costs to a well and a septic system (unless it is a holding tank as already stated. Our cottage is on of those and we pump it 4-5 times a year) but when they go, it costs a lot to fix. I go to Toronto once in a while (heading there Saturday) and I love being there but could not live there. I like my space and totally understand why you would be thinking of moving out of town."

Then moved to Grand Valley to get away from the busy city although I still worked in the city and commuted. Next I moved to Yellowknife in the NWT Canada's most northerly city population 18,000. The next move will be to my off grid cabin when I retire. It's 20kms or so down the road outside of town and then 14kms up the lake. I will make a weekly trips into town to resupply and am probably going to spend the winters down South in the sun.  "
1040485,Garnet,2019-02-15 11:31:00,2056,To help keep your septic system happy. If your are cleaning trout and the blood along backbone great to keep septic percolating. Little bits of blood from a steak all good. That crap you buy for septic is mostly dried blood. The weak point on your well is the foot valve. Either style submerged pump (pump at bottom of well) or pump at the top means you take cover of well and pump will be on a platform 4 ft down. Then long pipe to bottom where theirs a foot valve. With both system we always bought a second foot valve when the old one screwed up. Of course there are people that do this work but pretty straight forward.
1040491,AKRISONER,2019-02-15 13:57:00,5558,"this is definitely something I would need to make sure of, cell phone reception and good internet. Hopefully being closer to Parry Sound would help with that. Generally cell phone coverage in the area is very good, infact i typically get better coverage in PAB vs at my parents house in georgetown. yes Definitely standard stuff up there, thats why we drain the water lines literally every single time we leave the cottage for more than a day. yup definitely think the idea would be to buy a small tractor with a blower, much like we have at the lake currently as our road is not serviced. Also helps to fix the road when washouts occur. Much easier than hauling wheelbarrows of dirt, been there done that! I appreciate this comment because this is something I have thought about in great detail. 1. I definitely will be working from home for close to another year before even making any decision. As weird as it is, the city in a way can be extremely isolating. Especially living in a condo, there is absolutely 0 sense of community. I dont know my neighbors, have never talked to them. Even when I owned a house, trick or treaters etc never once came to my house because it was on a main road. I lived in a semi detached home and the only time I ever spoke to my neighbor was when he tried to tell me that the fascia on his awning was in perfect condition, meanwhile squirrles had eaten through it and were now nesting in the attic over my porch and I couldnt stop them because they were coming in through his side. I ended up having to get the city to go after him...Fun right? 2. An important factor in this entire decision, would be pending on my girlfriend's ability to still maintain her apartment in the city. This whole idea sparked up because we currently both have our own places, except I spend 4 days a week up north, 2 days at her house and then usually one night a week I am home in my own apartment. My girlfriend has a job in the city and will be staying here, but the thought here is why do we need two places here? I drive from pointe au baril to toronto every week almost anyways, would it be so different to reverse that drive? 3. I generally hate and avoid crowds, Youd never find me at a festival, or fishing show or any of that kind of stuff, im generally out on my own or with a friend fishing. My girlfriend is much the same except switch the fishing for reading. We both hate crowds. 4. Why of course, i have the best winter hobbies of all, snowboarding, fishing and snowmobiling. Winter was actually my favourite season prior to me owning a boat, then things kind of swayed the other way lol. 5. I honestly dont know if I like gardening, I did a little tiny bit of it at my old house, but now that I am in a condo I cant do any. Important to remember here folks, Im not actually truly a ""city person"" I spent the first 8 years of my life in Flin Flon Manitoba, I then grew up in Georgetown, prior to it becoming an extension of brampton. I used to think that some day I would just move back there, because growing up there was awesome it still had a small town vibe, was quiet and everyone knew eachother...times have changed and I swear on my life, there is no damn chance I would ever consider living in the GTA unless it was in the actual city. I literally think that living in Brampton or Mississauga is the worst kind of hell. Luckily, my dad and brothers are both engineers, my dad specifically works in non-ferrous hydrometallurgy so unless you have 5 hours to talk about pumps with him you just avoid the conversation lol.  All of this input is friggin awesome."

One minute the bugs are manageable, the sun fully sets and you hear it...its like a distant hum. The next thing you know you look down and your hands are literally coated with a layer of blood suckers. Usually this is when we pack up and head home in the boat...you then hold your breath while tying off of the boat for the night as quickly as possible. Typically by the time you are done tying the boat the bugs have found you again and you sprint inside and spend the next 20 minutes killing all of the mosquitos that have found their way into the cottage in the millisecond you had the door open."

1049511,Hack_Fisherman,2019-09-09 13:47:00,720,"This is an interesting thread. Every time we camp or rent cottages we both dream of living up north. We could never afford to own a cottage AND a home in the city at the same time but your thread has me thinking again...we could afford to sell and relocate. My job could technically be remote also and her career is one that’s in demand everywhere. But like all the good folks here have mentioned, there’s a lot of drawbacks. We spent a lot of time in the Huntsville area in every season considering the move. 3 things turned me off; 1) food culture. Someone mentioned it earlier. No great dining choices. You cook your own gourmet meals 2) Locals vs Cottagers. There appears to be a real defined us vs them attitude both ways. I’m seeing it again this week. Our beat up starcraft super sport is a little out of place in Muskoka. Camp hillbilly just arrived....sorry, still running filthy 2 strokes... 3) is the biggest...black fly/mosquito season. i don’t know if I could stand living at a 4 season cottage those 2 months a year. We are dog people, so that means several trips outside daily. We go up north any month of the year except May & June. But I totally get why you want to move up. First day anywhere north of the Severn River and I am relaxed.  "

Schools? Is culture important in your life? I tell young people this all the time...build a safety net in your life. What does option B look like if your existing company restructures or goes under? Is a happy medium a better choice? Say lower GBay whereas it’s still commutable to TO for work, healthcare, etc if necessary?

1049539,AKRISONER,2019-09-10 02:06:00,5558,"UPDATE: for those that asked as mentioned here, after some long consideration I came to the conclusion that with my current work situation and the availability of my families place in PAB, I have held off on moving to my own home for the time being. a few thoughts related to the comments here: 1. No offense to anyone here, but as mentioned in this thread by Jimmer, the kawarthas and surrounding area are far too busy for the lake life that I will eventually be looking for. I spend 4 weekends a year on the tri-lakes and clear/Stoney and it can be worse than the city with the seadoo, cigarette boat, wakeboard boat crowds. 2. Barrie from what I witness when I regularly pass through has really taken a turn for the worst in recent years. The “drugs” thread touched on the what appears to be opioid and meth problem that has spiked there recently. It’s more the rule than the exception for me to now see tweakers and junkies in the essa and Bayfield areas of town. It’s really unfortunate. 3. Due to some uncertainties related to the program that I work for (automotive material stewardship) there’s a slight chance that my program could see some major changes in the next two years resulting in me needing to switch jobs potentially to one that would be more office based. As such making a huge investment in the parry sound area is going to need some more time. I have made it clear to my live in girlfriend that If she decides it’s time to start a family, we are leaving the city as we can’t raise a family in an apartment in the city. She agreed but we aren’t there yet. 4. Bugs...i survived this year and if I can make it through the bug season we had in pointe au baril this year then I’ll manage. I’ll have to post some of my videos from blackfly/mosquito season. It was quite literally overboard to the point that there were days that I couldn’t take my dog for a walk not because of me, but because my dog was suffering too much, and he’s tough. 5. Winters? I love winter and snow. (I’m originally from northern Manitoba) Up until I owned my own boat snow and winter were my favourite season. No problem. 6. Culinary, I agree that not being able to grab a burrito/chipotle on the regular might drive me a bit crazy so it’s an interesting point to make. But I think trading off burritos for fishing is worth it ? 7. Culture and raising children, well luckily I’m a Canadian mutt, so my culture is the north lol. As far as raising kids, I was raised in Flin Flon and Georgetown. Both small towns, where I stayed out with my friends all summer at 14 years old till two in the morning riding bikes and swimming in pools. I wouldn’t want it any different for my kids should I someday decide that’s the path I want to take. Being too remote can obviously present challenges in that regard. It’d be important to at least be near a town like parry sound or the like. That is IF and that’s an emphasized IF I would want kids. I don’t think either me or my gf of almost 3 years are convinced we’d ever want children and we are both already 31. 8. Current living situation is allowing me to kind of get best of both worlds. My family has a place up north that I can basically spend as much time as I want at already. what I’ve been doing almost all summer is spending 4+ days a week up here when I can. The only thing that’s been bringing me home is the fact that my girlfriend still works and lives in the city. I tested the waters with my old man to see what he’d think of me being up here so much, but I’m realizing that as he ages he doesn’t seem to mind having an extra strong young hand to help upkeep the place. It saves his tired back and allowed things to get done in much quicker fashion than normal where we only had a day and a half a week to get the marine rail systems set up, the docks In and the boathouse cribs fixed up etc etc. for now I’m keeping quite and seeing how long he is cool with me squatting here ?"
1040412,AKRISONER,2019-02-13 16:57:00,5558,"Hey guys, As most of you would know, I am a city dude, own a condo in Toronto and cottage in Pointe Au Baril most weekends at my parents place. A recent change at my work has resulted in me now working remotely and at home which subsequently allows me to spend far more time at the lake. Ive begun to realize that the only reason I still live in Toronto is because 1. my girlfriend works here (she lives in her own condo) and 2. I play hockey here. As the months pass I am starting to realize that I find myself nearly every week waiting for my wednesday night hockey game to finish so that I can get up early thursday morning and head up north. I easily work from home up there and find myself in much better spirits for the rest of the week. I may not always get to fish, but the ability to tinker on the boat, snowmobiles, fishing gear etc, and simply do yard work is something that I really enjoy and that I do not get to do at all while living in a condo. Added to all of this, and maybe I am just being a wimp? but the city itself is getting big, and the violence seems to be getting worse as the population grows. Shootings are becoming somewhat of a regular occurrence. Just last month one happened across the street in broad daylight 15 minutes before I was about to walk my dog to the exact spot where the shooting occurred, 2 weeks prior to that a building down the street was absolutely lit up with automatic gun fire and the icing on the cake was the shooting that occurred in the lobby of my building earlier in 2018, where the front doors were riddled with bullet holes. I know you must all think that I live in the projects...sadly not at all. I live in a 2 year old building of high end condos at the corner of dufferin and lawrence. Not the greatest neighborhood in the city, but its whats affordable, and shootings in a building filled with half a million dollar+ condos just shouldnt be happening. So all things considered, I am heavily considering moving to a small house with a big garage up north. Heres where I need some help, ive been a home owner in the city, its simple, the sewage goes down the drain, your heat and hydro come from lines that are attached to the grid. I know that being 15 minutes outside of a place like Parry sound would be far different. So what should I be considering when thinking about living up there? Im guessing most things would be on a septic system, if so, whats the approximate cost of keeping one running? What about a well? How much should I be expecting to spend to keep one going Heat? To what extent does gas service reach the area? What about if I went to a propane system? Or is a woodstove the best way? Maybe a pellet stove? Property Taxes? What do they typically look like for someone living in the country side? Your services are limited but the population base is much smaller, what is to expect? Surprises, is there anything else that I am totally oblivious to that I should be considering? I know I would need a damn good snowblower, or perhaps a quad for clearing the driveway?"

1040414,jimmer,2019-02-13 17:25:00,2730,"The well is a big issue. You have to make sure you have good capacity throughout the year. Nothing worse than having the well going dry. There should be a record of this somewhere. Probably need like 7 gallons/min output. There shouldn't be a huge cost to keep it going if you have a good quality pump and pressure tank. Septic systems vary, so make sure it has weeping tiles and not just a holding tank. otherwise you will be paying to have that pumped regularly. Low maintenance cost unless the weeping bed gets plugged and you have to redo it. Have the septic tank pumped every 5 years. That's my opinion on pumping. You probably won't have gas lines. I would recommend a good wood stove/pellet and a high efficiency propane furnace. Some insurance companies won't cover you if you have a wood stove as your main heat source, so you will have to look into that. Taxes are different in every municipality, so you should definitely check that before even looking at a house. Who wants to pay $10,000/year for taxes. Mine in the Kawarthas is around $2,800/year. Lots of toys to deal with snow and outdoor stuff. lol You can expect a much quieter life."
1040415,chris.brock,2019-02-13 18:02:00,4053,"Exciting times! Do your research, you're not in a rush. I like being on a well, septic bed and wood burning at my cottage. My only fixed cost is hydro and property tax."

Gangs and the drug trade arent going anywhere anytime soon, and as long as people are doing drugs, the gun violence isnt going to stop. This is how its done elsewhere in places like the United States and Jamaica etc. so unless somehow those places stop (never going to happen), then the problem will only grow. ill have a chat with my old man about the well at the lake and how that is managed. Luckily I also have 2 civil engineers in my immediate family, plus an additional chemical engineer that specializes in ""water"" so I have some good resources to consult that way. What are you running on Jimmer? or what would your preference be for heating? I am astonished that your taxes are actually so low, considering the fact that I live in a condo and pay close to that, mind you property values are ridiculous, hence high taxes. The toys thing, yup, snowblowers, quads, skidoos, my boat all things id love to have a nice space to store and work on if need be, funny enough living in my condo beside a park my life is fairly quite as it is. But nothing beats the silence of the north. At least for me that is. I also like the idea of ""it takes 20 minutes to drive there"" and low and behold, no matter what time of day it is, it actually takes 20 minutes to drive there. Funny how that works, for me to get to hockey on weeknights it can take upwards of 20 minutes on what should be a 5 minute drive. exactly...this would be a big transition and one I would definitely get all of my ducks in a row before locking in on. Looking at real estate in the area, I could be very close to mortgage free after cashing out of the Toronto housing market. Pretty good for a 30 year old. any idea if this type of thing can be done prior to buying the home i.e. in the purchase of sale agreement? Also, the cottage we are on is a septic bed system, which we recently just had to redo...i think it cost around $10,000?"
1040419,Gerritt,2019-02-13 19:57:00,6129,"Cant add more then whats been suggested here. Propane or oil is typically what you see installed in rural homes, and they are more costly to operate then natural gas based on fuel costs, so if your used to natural gas pricing you will be in for a bit of sticker shock.... alot of folks (including myself) go on a budget plan so you have a fixed monthly bill against your fuel deliveries.. Make sure you get the flow rate for your well from the previous owner and get the water tested every 3 months through your local health unit, this is a free service. Another consideration is the availability of high speed internet, many in rural areas have poor access to decent high speed and have to rely on companies like explorenet etc... this is costly and generally not well liked by their customers...but they have little to no choice in many areas.  Just some thoughts in my experience of living rural most of my life  G.   "

We have baseboards as the heat source for those times, so that's why I recommend a high efficiency propane furnace an top of a wood stove. I definitely wish we had propane now that I am getting older. Might be happening in the near future."
1040421,NAW,2019-02-13 21:14:00,4022,"I lived on a bush lot for many years.  Septic.  Oil Furnace. There is to much to type right now.  I think we need to go fishing together and chat.!  I highly highly recommend moving though.  I can assure you, that if you find the right place, you will enjoy a much higher quality of life know how much you enjoy the outdoors. "

1040423,misfish,2019-02-13 21:20:00,29133,"My parents heated with wood. Chopped and stacked many a cords for them. Now it,s a bit to much, so they have gone to propane. They love it.  They also have a generator that powers up the whole house."
1040425,lew,2019-02-13 22:31:00,12766,"I think an automatic stand-by generator is one of the best investments a person can make when living in the country and was one of the 1st things I bought when we moved here 9 years ago. Nice to know when the power goes out the Genny will fire up and run pretty well everything in the house which is especially important when you rely on electric pumps for getting water into the house and more importantly getting it back outside. We usually lose several times a year, sometimes for a day or more, and it's very reassuring to know  when it does go out you've got nothing to worry about."

1040427,adempsey,2019-02-13 23:24:00,1498,"A good real-estate agent from the area you are looking should know all of this and help you with any questions. Don't get someone who is a friend of a friend etc unless they know the area well. Also, I hope your job is very secure and that you can keep working from home. Really think about this before you move. You could get stuck in a bad situation. Hopefully your girlfriend feels the same way (or is that soon to be ex-girlfriend? lol)"
1040428,OhioFisherman,2019-02-13 23:26:00,6623,""" I am astonished that your taxes are actually so low, considering the fact that I live in a condo and pay close to that, mind you property values are ridiculous, hence high taxes. "" Akri, I live in a rural township here, a move to the nearest small city would almost double my property taxes for a home of equal value. The township is run by elected trustees and they are basically part time employees, we don't have to pay taxes for a full time mayor and things like that. Our police protection is contracted out thru the county sheriff and our fire department is volunteers."

1040430,ketchenany,2019-02-14 01:13:00,3229,"Ak I know what you mean. No matter where we are that stuff will follow us.  I was in my 20s. when I lived close to the area  Allen Rd and Eglignton. Yorkdale was there but never  went.  Yes Brian, Burger Barn, but the guys with cars went to Harvey’s. When McDonalds  opened  they went under! I have seen lots of Ontrio but with family commitments will stay just outside of the big city. Venturing south of Steels is scary. NOT because of the happenings, Mine is the traffic and avoiding bikes and streetcars. You have to re-educate yourself when you venture there. I have to do it once or two times because of my wife’s medical appointments. Good luck with your choice. Anything is better that city life with your apportunities and location.    "

1040434,MJIG,2019-02-14 03:15:00,227,"Many considerations have been well-described earlier in this thread, but here’s a few more: Hard well water may require a water softener unit/treatment. Garbage pickup availability? How far is it to the nearest landfill? You may also want/need a few additional tools/gadgets that may not be needed in a city home/condo: lawn tractor, chain saw, utility trailer,  snow blower, tree pruner, sump pump, water infiltration alarms, ladders, surveillance/security. It may turn out that your road isn’t one of the first plowed if homes along the route are sparse or no school buses need to travel along it, but it may be tough to know this in advance unless you talk to would-be neighbours. Repairmen/contractors may add travel charges if it’s an exceptionally long drive to get to your place from their place. "

We had a propane fireplace the was about 70% efficiency, and installed a propane furnace about 97% efficient We looked at a place that had a septic installed in 1975 but since that time the basement was finished with two more bedrooms and a bathroom, i don't thi n k it would meet the requirements currently Lots of people are renting out there cottages to pay for taxes or cover costs of ownership,."

1040441,fisherman7,2019-02-14 14:32:00,325,"We moved from the city to the lake about 3 years ago and haven't looked back. Lots of great advice and the only thing I will add is have your septic, and home inspected top to bottom - and for septics just keep in mind, if it can go in you, it can go in a septic! Otherwise don't flush it down the toilet or drain. And CLR makes this blue septic treatment that works really well."

1040457,smitty55,2019-02-14 17:06:00,928,While I agree the CLR product is is a good one so far as regular retail goes I recommend trying Hycura. It is an industrial/commercial strength product used by municipalities etc. For home use a year's supply is $80 tax in with free delivery from Calgary. They even go as far to suggest that it works so well that tank pumping isn't necessary as there is no sludge build up. https://www.hycura.com/?v=3e8d115eb4b3  Cheers
