1049089,Terry,2019-08-30 17:35:00,14456,I looked at the phots I posted and it didn’t show the detail the photos on my computer showed so here are some zoomed in shots     
1049104,Sinker,2019-08-30 23:12:00,8692,That thing is sick! I love it! Is it street legal too? S. 
1049107,irishfield,2019-08-30 23:16:00,26272,"Cool Terry! Shayne it has to be street legal, plated and insured the only part that sucks about mini trucks for ice fishing. Wishing I'd bought that Bombi.. as as a Utility vehicle it has no VIN.. only needs a slow moving vehicle triangle and is covered under house insurance at ZERO cost... I'm looking again, but sure waiting for Terry to blow by in the truck !!! LOL"
1049108,Terry,2019-08-30 23:17:00,14456,"it is still licensed for the road ,but the  atv tires make it illegal for roads ,so I think I will license it as an UTV soon"
1049112,dave524,2019-08-30 23:32:00,4508,"Is it an air cooled engine ?, hope the heater works better than my old '68 bug ?"
1049114,Terry,2019-08-30 23:35:00,14456,No it’s water cooled and is very warm in the winter.
1049116,irishfield,2019-08-30 23:40:00,26272,Didn't know you could do that. Can I take my F150 and make it a UTV?
1049117,Terry,2019-08-30 23:46:00,14456,"i think there is a size limit I have not tried,  but a couple of guys on a forum said they had no trouble getting them licensed  I will check it out soon"
1049144,Sinker,2019-08-31 16:30:00,8692,So you trailer it to the lake?
1049147,Terry,2019-08-31 17:15:00,14456,No drive it down the road in Innisfil
1049148,cisco,2019-08-31 18:13:00,597,"Great job Terry! Light background, a few diff leaf stencils and fern/cedar branches to spray over and some grass/duck boat green oversprays and a few black lines here and there. Been doing it for years and once had a US guy ask where I bought the boat since he's looking for one just like it..... boat is like 40 years old and he thought it new. Cost is peanuts compared to having the pros do it. Maybe do the tires and hubs too!"
1049327,pike slayer,2019-09-04 10:53:00,1177,I had this idea for up at my camp around wawa cause I can't boot it down the highway on an UTV. A guy in the sault has one and uses it with tracks to get to his camp in the winter with tracks. He says being right hand drive it's impossible to insure now days and sits at his camp. Have you got insure on yours?
1049328,Terry,2019-09-04 11:04:00,14456,i had no trouble getting it insured
1049384,davis,2019-09-05 17:32:00,128,i love it! nice job
1049015,Terry,2019-08-29 20:38:00,14456,So I have been working on the mini truck getting it ready for hunting and ice fishing 2” lift. and atv tires. I wanted to get it painted camo. They wanted way too much and the camo wrap was way to expensive so time to try doing it myself under a hundred bucks and I’m good to go  im really  happy with how it turned out for a first attempt     
1049016,kickingfrog,2019-08-29 20:43:00,8333,That's awesome.
1049018,lew,2019-08-29 20:47:00,12766,"Looks as good as any store bought paint job Terry, really nice."
1049019,aplumma,2019-08-29 21:14:00,6896,Nice Job Terry when you said Camo I thought how hard can it be to paint it Canadian Camo White.  Art
1049021,glen,2019-08-29 21:31:00,2641,Can I borrow that please. What’s the weight.
1049022,glen,2019-08-29 21:33:00,2641,Don’t you need snow camp for on the ice. Looks great.
1049023,Terry,2019-08-29 21:34:00,14456,about 1500 lbs
1049024,ketchenany,2019-08-29 21:47:00,3229,Great job Terry. Now you can tow Brian!
1049027,glen,2019-08-29 22:37:00,2641,Nice to ride inside with the heat on instead of atv
1049028,misfish,2019-08-29 22:44:00,29133,"Oh don't even get me started on that. He showed up last year wearing sneakers. I guess when one can, he does. I know one thing,I don't fit in it.  But ya Albert  You can bet his ass, he will be. Well back in anyways. He is a late comer. LOL  Looks cool buddy."
1049029,Terry,2019-08-29 22:44:00,14456,"yup and cheaper then buying a utv and adding heat ,windows, doors  wipers and whatnot"
1049032,Fisherman,2019-08-29 23:39:00,7201,"Needs a winch, just in case."

1049035,OhioFisherman,2019-08-29 23:45:00,6623,"? Is that a you-go, looks good to me!"

1049069,mamona,2019-08-30 13:38:00,597,Bad a$$ looking!  	Do not scare me that winter is coming though...
1049078,Squid,2019-08-30 14:50:00,1656,Great job Terry! It looks awesome. Only thing missing in the front seat is Bubbles ?Should be lots of fun on the ice!!
1049080,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-30 14:57:00,8243,"You did a fantastic job Terry, you should be very proud. Camo came out great."
1049085,bassman87,2019-08-30 15:48:00,586,"my god thats really impressive, good job man"
1049086,Terry,2019-08-30 16:13:00,14456,"thanks all I had no idea how to do it, so i watched youtube but thought they looked crappy took some ideas i had and some of their ideas and tried it I think i found a new business, finished two days ago and a utv owner and a guy with a truck has asked me how much to do theirs "
1049087,jimmer,2019-08-30 16:16:00,2730,"That's awesome, every ice fisherman/person needs one of those!"
