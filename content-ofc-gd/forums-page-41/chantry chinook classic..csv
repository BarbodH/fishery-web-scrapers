WOW ! they showed the guy & fish. i have the pic on my facebook timeline . the poston facebook came from, GODERICH CITIZEN'S EXCHANGE !"
1048318,BrentS89,2019-08-11 21:26:00,13,That would be a nice fish in the derby. The past few years the salmon have been a little small.

1048332,J Roelofsen,2019-08-12 07:46:00,84,There was a 30+lb caught on Manitoulin this week as well ? Josh
1048352,CRUD150,2019-08-12 19:51:00,87,"Fish caught #'s were down, but fish size were way up this year. Pretty well took a 17 pounder to get on the top 25 board. That means they are eating something out there!"
1048353,misfish,2019-08-12 20:03:00,29133,Maybe eating the perch like the lakers in Simcoe are doing.
1048375,BillM,2019-08-13 17:41:00,17367,Lots of salmon in Gbay eating cisco
1048413,Snidley,2019-08-14 21:14:00,620,And baby lakers stocked by Michigan
1048758,muskybw,2019-08-24 13:44:00,116,hello  they just scaled a 29.5 lb. chinook !   that is huge for Lake Huron. i read it on facebook !
1048773,rockin-steelhead,2019-08-24 16:21:00,19,The 29.5 was weighed in Owen Sound and is leading the derby now.
1048775,muskybw,2019-08-24 17:14:00,116,"thanks, the pic on FB., doesn't really show its size ?"
1049214,muskybw,2019-09-02 13:51:00,116,"i was talking to a friend that fishes salmon & trout out of grand bend, says the salmon stomachs filled with SMELT, maybe that's why they are getting sooo big ???"
1049225,Snidley,2019-09-02 16:03:00,620,"That's good news because I've always been told that salmon can't survive on smelt. I bet it makes for a way tastier flesh on them as well. Thornbury here I come,lol"
1049244,misfish,2019-09-02 21:40:00,29133,"Maybe I,ll see you out there."
