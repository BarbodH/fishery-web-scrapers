Ive used various swimming/diving baits, small& large spinners, tube jigs, grubs and small spoons. Tough few days and I’ve thrown nearly everything at them. Do you guys have preference for early fall selection, choices or techniques? the lake I’m on is tea stained. Colour suggestions?"
1049507,woodenboater,2019-09-09 12:39:00,2277,Was up north of Kenora and the pike were smashing my Cranking Raps and Divers (Firetiger pattern). Probably could have gone larger as they inhaled them deep. Also caught Mooneye on same.
1049508,AKRISONER,2019-09-09 13:25:00,5558,"been relying on my electronics to find the smallies, they seem to have moved out off of the edge because of the wild temperature swings up shallow and are easily spotted in 20+fow. Ive simply been dropping a drop shot right on their heads. Ive found a few fish shallow grinding cranks, but more consistent bite is off shore. They are all puking up crayfish big time when i pull them up. The pike are all holding to the liveliest sections of weeds. Any time ive found healthy weeds the pike are holding to them as the majority of milfoil etc is now dying off."

Depth, I have caught largemouth at Pointe Au Baril in 20 feet of water hanging out with the small mouth, the only reason I could think of it happening was food, cooling temps, but not that cool? Jig and soft plastic? Fall is sort of strange at times, especially if you are having wide temperature swings."

1049576,SirCranksalot,2019-09-10 22:24:00,3291,"My white and my crayfish pattern Big ""O""s are my faves at any time of year. A wacky worm near weeds or timber works quite well esp on sunny days,  My bud used to swear by watermelon but  have used diff colors---pink, etc. The advantage of pink is that you can see your bait better and watch it being gulped on occasion.
