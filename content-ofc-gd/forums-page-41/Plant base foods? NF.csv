1047554,Rod Caster,2019-07-25 14:17:00,5784,"They look like a fine group of highly-supplemented gentlemen with lots of scientists monitoring the heck out of them and convincing them that cholesterol is bad even though your liver makes it, you are dead without it, and it is the building block for all of your hormones and cell membranes. Its a well-produced promotional video, and I think that one doctor is the same guy in the 'What the Health' documentary, which contained a lot of bad science and retracted studies. There are extremes on both ends of this story. The main difference being that the animal-based eaters rarely need to supplement with anything but real food (like more salt)  "
1047568,iFish4real,2019-07-25 16:18:00,386,"There's a lot more to cholesterol than that. HDL = good cholesterol LDL = bad cholesterol A simple Google search can clarify for you what they mean, do and how they can affect your health. Once you know the science behind it, you don't need videos to tell you what you should eat or not ? You should though check your cholesterol levels once a year, especially cause it seems to get worse with age ? "
1047574,Rod Caster,2019-07-25 17:02:00,5784,"A simple Google search will give you a simple answer. Casi, when you have time (your on OFC at noon so I assume you have time  ), take a minute to look up Dave Feldman or Dr. Nadir Ali and see what they have to say about cholesterol and then cross-reference what they are saying. It's always worth doing more research especially if you have high cholesterol and see it as a bad thing, it might help you control/understand it. This is a fishing forum, I don't want to spend too much time talking about nutrition here. I just hope that everyone who eats a plant based burger gets awful farts and stomach pains and learns a lesson. By the way, smelt and mackerel have more cholesterol than beef per 100 g serving, so don't eat them because your blood will halt to a stop https://food-nutrition.canada.ca/cnf-fce/report-rapport.do https://food-nutrition.canada.ca/cnf-fce/report-rapport.do "

And medium ground beef tastes much better than lean or extra lean. They don't fall apart either, I have a secret so they don't. We eat burgers maybe twice a month though. Beef isn't in the budget any longer.  This pensioner too has a freezer full of pork loin at $1.99 a pound. Everything from pulled pork to schnitzels. Had a pork roast tonight actually with my homemade pasta. Last night was Portuguese beefana, thin sliced pork leg in pepper sauce in Portuguese buns. Beef smeef. But I have to tell ya, if I could only eat veggies if they could taste as good as the ones Mom used to put away in the fall I could handle it. Some of her eggplant tasted like beef. I could never even come close if I tried. We haven't tried these veggie burgers, I don't plan on it either."

1047002,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-12 14:14:00,720,"It’s a culmination of things. Three main things driving it are Environment, Ethics and health. And I guess maybe religion may be a factor in there somewhere. (Buddhist, Hindi, Muslim and other asian and middle eastern practices) Environmentally, It (reportedly) takes as much energy to create a cheeseburger (fast food) as it does to drive an average car for 6 hours. I’ve heard that it takes 7 acres to raise a steer but only 1/2 acre to sustain the life of a vegetarian. I don’t know if these are hard facts or embellished stats to support the vegan cause or not. I’m not a vegetarian or vegan (my diet is about as bad as it gets) but I am starting to pay attention and try new things. I’ll always eat meat and fish But Einstein’s famous quote has me pondering, especially as the environment seems to struggle;  ""Nothing will benefit health or increase chances of survival on earth as the evolution to a vegetarian diet."" As for meatless sausage or burgers, they aren’t great but they aren’t bad. The Licks brand burgers are actually pretty good. Mushroom gravy is also surprisingly good. I didn’t expect that one"
1047003,crappieperchhunter,2019-07-12 14:53:00,2582,"I am not a vegan and never will be,  but if you have not tried mushroom gravy you haven't lived yet. And the best thing about it is if you just feel like gravy on some mashed potatoes you don't have to cook a whole  beef roast or a chicken or turkey to get a good gravy to pour on things."

1047172,AKRISONER,2019-07-17 14:10:00,5558,"to answer the OP's question, what the heck is with the sudden push? my understanding is that a lot of it has to do with the vast market of Hindu practicing people that reside in Ontario. Their population far exceeds that of vegetarians. Its a significant market that has not been capitalized on.  As mentioned in this thread, the beyond meat plant based products are not ""healthy"" they are full of sodium and other oily fats. The plant based burgers are actually made to be ""juicy"" and flavourful. They are full of salt and oil. Hence your market is not people that eat grass and lentils for a living. You are marketing to people that simply cant eat beef for religious or other reasons. Im honestly curious and will probably try out an A&W burger at some point just to try it. Ill probably then go right back and buy a teen burger lol."
1047178,Canuck,2019-07-17 15:25:00,491,"Vegetarians are also buying them (probably looking for something that tastes good!).  I have tried the A&W burgers as well as the Beyond Meat ones on a home BBQ.  They are pretty good, but no where near as good as a real home made beef burger.  Sort of like the Licks veg burgers that were popular when Licks chain was a thing.  They tasted pretty good, but not as good as the real burgers at Licks.  I would like to think its just a fad that will come and go because people will catch on about how high fat and sodium they are."
1047187,Rod Caster,2019-07-17 20:12:00,5784,"The idea that animal ag is a major contributor to GHG emissions (many people still believe the ridiculous claim of 51% worldwide) comes from retracted reports from the FAO that were shown in propaganda movies (what the health/cowspiracy - both by the same 'activist' director Kip Anderson) where they compare animal energy inputs (moment its born to the moment it goes in your mouth) only to the tailpipe emissions of the energy industry and transportation. Frank Mitlohner showed how these studies the comparisons were wrong; the studies were since amended to much lower numbers, but the cat was out of the bag... and the movies stayed the same. Frank Mitloehener did a great job at pointing out the problems in the reports, leading to a re-calculation. http://theconversation.com/yes-eating-meat-affects-the-environment-but-cows-are-not-killing-the-climate-94968 They also count animal water as consumptive only, ignoring that they piss out or transpire the water, thus; recycling it (especially on pasture) back to nature, so they'll say 'cows use xx gallons of water. Cows don't 'use' water, they consume it then excrete it. Methane from cows is a flow-through gas, meaning that it is not accumulative (unlike fossil fuel based methane), but rather part of a cycle (like the normal carbon cycle in nature - think trees growing, rotting, turning to CO2 then taking in CO2 to produce cellulose based trees again). Cows replaced large ruminants of the past, the ones that were market hunted to near extinction in the US/Canada. The US/Canada by far are the worlds most efficient producers of food cattle (Aussie/NZ do good too). Feed lots are not the best thing if you care about animals more than people; they are also quite unsightly, but they sure are efficient.  Cows are awesome. Let's continue to improve the process, but cows themselves are not a 'problem'. If we start eating foods that are 1/2 as nutrient dense and bio-available (plants), then we will need twice as much food, most of it trucked in from far away, and keep in mind that the majority of food waste comes from plant foods. Also, to wind down this too-long post, keep in mind that ruminant animals largely thrive on feed that is not suitable for humans. We generally do not compete for resources. They can grow in the forest or on grass land, in semi-arid conditions, and fertilize the soil. Humans can't eat trees or grass and plants need animal fertilizers (or mined chemical fertilizers) to grow.   "

Many cultures don't allow beef and/or pork but their members are sold on the BIG restaurant chain ads/hype that gets them wanting to go. Also their friends from meat-eating cultures also go there and to join in it is good biz to have similar products of a plant-based kind.  It has zero to do with us meat eaters other than it's more comfy to have friends join and enjoy without having meat as deterrent. It's all good IMHO.

Take for example ingredient #5 in Beyond Meat : Methycellulose, also known as the primary ingredient in KY Jelly, it is produced by timber companies such as Tembec. It is not food! Almost all health/environmental claims they make are conflated or completely wrong.  These are not whole foods or good foods. The pea protein they are made from is at best 50% bio-available and known as a common allergen. If you have GI issues, stay away from these products! Good food is unrefined and typically has one ingredient.  Good meat, including organ meats, are the most nutrient-dense and bio-available foods we have at our disposal. Liver is a darn supplement if you look at its nutritional density. This is indisputable, except by those who think eating a KY Jelly burger is better for you because it fits your confused religion, who are just rebelling against their own existence as a high trophic-level animal. There are NO unique nutrients in plants that humans need that are not available in animals. I love the taste of plants, but that's only to satisfy my mouth, not my nutritional needs. Search : Paul Saladino - Eat nose-to-tail. All animals contain all the nutrients you need and are super bio-available and easy on your gut.

I look forward to seeing meal worm used in alternative foods so we can sort out the people who are really trying to save the planet  :) Secondly, my gf is pescatarian. This stuff just means options, easier negotiating where we eat, easier to make meals at home. If we have to eat at McDonalds on the road, she gets a wrap and removes the chicken. They charge the same amount so if she can actually get food instead of ripped off, that’s a good change. I used to eat meat daily without even thinking about it, but a few years ago I had some health issues that sidelined me for months. Veggies are important to your digestive health and lean protein like fish and chicken is much better for you. A piece of red meat or even pork every week seems like overkill now. I have no issues with people eating meat or soy, but Now I’m careful to make sure the meat is the meal and not an after thought. Ground beef at most restaurants is garbage, chicken as a topping on pasta or pizza I s often a roll of the dice, pork is used cuz it’s cheap. Tilapia is acceptable ‘fish’, it’s darn mushy garbage. Anyway rant over, the most important thing about food is that it’s healthy and you enjoy it and it makes you feel good. It took a trip to the emerg to realize that for me. "

This is my first attempt at hydroponics and it has been fun watching my stuff grow. No weeding, cultivating and the growth rate is amazing. Want  a salad, to go with that steak? Go out and pick enough romaine or lettuce leaves that you need for a meal. Next week there will be more growing in. Starting on our second round of strawberries; all the blossoms are back. Dan."
