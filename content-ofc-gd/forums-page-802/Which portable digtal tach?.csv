348562,Tomcat,2009-06-05 02:11:00,395,"I'm not satisfied with the way my 1 year old Honda 15 HP 4 stroke trolls. Trolls too fast in forward for walleye fishing. Consequently, I do a lot of back trolling. Still, I've experienced some stalling problems while back trolling. I thought that checking the RPMs during fishing trips might facilitate a solution . In that regard, can anyone recommend a portable (battery powered) digital tach? Tiny Tach and a Stihl EDT6 were hits on a Google search. Thanks in advance"
348648,Greencoachdog,2009-06-05 13:58:00,8163,"PM Daplumma or Aplumma, they have pretty nice ones on their jet boats... I think it's the Tiny Tach, but I'm not sure."
348649,glen,2009-06-05 14:02:00,2641,Forget the tach.  You need to get an electric trolling motor if you want to go that slow.
348669,leighfns,2009-06-05 15:06:00,103,grab a couple drift socks...  I use them with my 115 hp Optimax and get down to 1 mph easily.  Otherwise I use my electric and keep the engine in to steer the boat.
348678,DanD,2009-06-05 15:50:00,2223,"Whichever tach you decide on; make sure it is compatible with your ignition system; as in will it operate with multiple coils; if this motor has multiple coils. Or if you connect it to the ECM’s (computer) tach terminal; that it will not affect the ECM. Believe me the ECM is not cheap; the factory tach that came with my BF40hp Honda, shorted and took out the ECM, $800.00 before the motor was running again. But what is the point of knowing exactly what RPM it stalls at? All you’re going to do is bump the idle up when you reach that point; which will defeat your goal of going slower.  Maybe a prop change would accomplish what you’re after; but that will also cause your top end to suffer?  Dan."
363663,scugpg,2009-07-18 15:22:00,1373,I'd like to revive this thread. Does anyone know where I can get the Tiny Tach in Canada OR another similar device that will do my 2 cylinder outboard?
363664,Daplumma,2009-07-18 15:28:00,1961,I can vouch for the tiny tach.It also acts as an hour meter.I live in the states and just ordered it from Tiny Tach. http://www.tinytach.com/tinytach/index.php
363673,scugpg,2009-07-18 15:57:00,1373,"I'd like to get that one, but would like to save the $ from ordering down south if possible. If not than I'll order one up sounds like a nice piece of equipment....and key when trying to figure out optimal prop size."
364450,scugpg,2009-07-20 21:07:00,1373,FYI anyone looking to order in Canada - the standard is $49.99 and commercial $83. Here's the contact info for us:  Canada Forster Instruments  Mississauga Ontario PH: 905-795-0555 Fax: 800-632-9943 Toll free within Canada: 800-661-2994 Contact: Theresa Heal
364543,Daplumma,2009-07-21 01:13:00,1961,If you have a boat with a console they can make the lead length as long as you need to reach the console. Joe
364572,Greencoachdog,2009-07-21 02:06:00,8163,  Eh Coonass!!! consoles RULE!!!
372334,scugpg,2009-08-13 14:26:00,1373,Just an FYI I ordered mine from Forrester instruments in Mississauga and it came 2 days later via xpresspost! Very helpful to deal with as well.
372452,boatman,2009-08-13 21:24:00,350,Thanks for taking the time to look into this Scugog. I've thought about getting a tiny tach for testing outboards. I guess I have no excuse not to now.
372461,Roy,2009-08-13 21:55:00,13728,"It's always a good idea to keep an eye on your RPMs BUT, I have a 60hp 4 stroke and troll down to 1.3 (GPS). If you can't get down to that speed with a 15hp there's definitely something wrong. Have you talked to the dealer about it?"
