372166,big daddy,2009-08-12 23:52:00,15,"Hi guys,  Just moved into the Collingwood area, and I have a boat I can take offshore.  I'm mainly interested in smallmouth and the area seems a natural with all the rocky shoals.  Still, the bay is pretty big, so any advice for areas/tactics to try would be appreciated from anyone who knows the area.  thanks in advance"
372176,jediangler,2009-08-13 00:29:00,1923,Go south to Lake Eugenia. There are some smallmouth but mostly largemouth. Lots of perch and rockbass as well.
372748,mark_74,2009-08-14 20:16:00,24,I'm also looking for some information on fishing in the Collingwood area. From what I understand Rainbow's are most predominant species. If anyone can offer any input for any species it would be appreciated.
