372367,tomkat,2009-08-13 16:13:00,246,If anyone has any tips on lure selections I would appreciate it. I tried all my usual Kawartha stuff only to be skunked on two previous occasions. I know theyre in there cause I had some follows on spinnerbaits. Thanks

372387,mepps,2009-08-13 17:23:00,1301,90% of my Jack Lake muskie have come on Mepps Black Furys. Jack muskie love small lures - caught several on #3s while fishing for bass. The muskie killer is you best bet for bigger fish though.   The other 10% were on the following:  Rapala Husky jerk - Tenesee shad Rapala X-rap - Clown Gulp Sinking Minnow - White And my own spinner baits with # 8 french blades
