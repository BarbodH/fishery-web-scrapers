372484,redneck666,2009-08-13 22:55:00,563,i was at the soo locks today and tried for some steelhead off the western pier. there was lots of nice ones terrorising the minnows but every time i threw a cleo in they'd either follow or look and turn away. i even threw in a teardrop but they seemed more focused on the live ones. how do i get the damn things to bite?
372486,StoneFly,2009-08-13 22:58:00,574," Try a live minnow?  If its permitted in that area?  Or maybe they were chinnok salmon, apparently they dont hit, Lol."
372489,dnb_cbr,2009-08-13 23:02:00,61,"small float, light line, small hook, live minnow, enough weight to get the bait down in the zone.  Berkley gulp or realistic minnows  would work in place of live.  In fact sometimes plastics are easier to present than live.  You could even try a small (1/32) jig head tipped with live or plastic minnow, under a float."
372492,redneck666,2009-08-13 23:13:00,563,"well this water isnt very fast at where i was fishing and the minnows that were being feasted on were pretty small i actually just got some great advice, get a cleo take off the treble put a 5"" stinger hook on tipped with a worm."
