I will be using it primarily on Georgian Bay.  The anchor is a 15 pound Navy, I have two 100 foot anchor lines, and 6 feet of chain.  Is this sufficient to hold my boat?  Thank you in advance for your advice.  Josh"

372406,smally21,2009-08-13 18:07:00,993,"depends on the bottom and wind conditons. 15 lbs is a lot of anchor for a 14', but you need that kind of weight in that style as it doesn't really 'bite' that much.  a blade style (FLUKE OR DANFORTH) allows you to carry less weight (7lb) and grab a sandy bottom better.  on the smooth sands of lake erie when it is windy my 18' could drag 100lb anchor, but i use an 11 lb danforth.  only drawback would be on rocky bottoms the flukes can get stuck, and you might lose it! nice call on the chain and the long lines, most conditions call for 5:1 or even 7:1 depth to anchor line ratios."
