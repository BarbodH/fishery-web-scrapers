He always took care of everything for me, which lures to bring, which spots to fish, which bait to use etc. I had to move away from Sudbury about 7 years ago where I lived in Toronto and then in Montreal. Now that I am back I have a few friends that like to go fishing.  Now here's the thing, we are pretty much rookies when it comes to fishing. My friend purchased a 14 foot boat with a 20 horsepower motor. My father also owns a boat, his is about 16 feet I think and it has a 30 horsepower boat. My brother has about the same thing but his motor is a 60 horsepower. So this is what I have have access to. So I know I won't be fishing a very large lakes with these smaller boats seeing how some of the larger lakes can become very dangerous in bad weather.  I prefer to fish/eat Walleye. however, I am willing to fish for trout, bass, pike etc. I currently live in valley-east and wanted to know if anyone knows of some good lakes for fishing in the area. By this I mean a lake where I can legally drive on public roads, launch a boat, park the truck and go fishing. I am willing to travel up to an hour or so out of Sudbury but obviously the closer the better if possible.  Also, if anyone has any websites where I can read up on...     Just anything where I can educate myself."
