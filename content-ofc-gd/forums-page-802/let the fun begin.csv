I just had a trolling motor installed and really excited to try it this weekend. i want to go bass fishing but don't really know any other lakes other than Simcoe Lake. as a newbie i am not very much familiar with any other lakes  could someone please recommend a lake in the 2 hours drive range from Richmond Hill, either Muskoka or Peterborough area for some good bass fishing?  Thanks in advance."

372693,bassjnkie,2009-08-14 16:17:00,1101,I like Rice Lake for bass. But I have to say my fav. is Simcoe.
372699,yarik20,2009-08-14 16:26:00,4,"i usually go to Simcoe every week and launch in Keswick, but i thought of trying something new, so maybe Rice lake or another one i just found is Pigeon lake near Bobcaygeon."
372732,johnnyb,2009-08-14 19:11:00,3413,Welcome aboard Yarik...Rice and Pigeon have pretty good reputations...fire up that new motor and get your first report posted!
