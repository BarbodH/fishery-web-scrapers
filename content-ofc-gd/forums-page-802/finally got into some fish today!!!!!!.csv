I am still a newbe lol but i actually got into some salmon today (sorry no pics, camera broke) we were fishing dipsys from 120 to 80 ft with the first rod set on setting 2 with 220 yrs out and the other was set on 1 with 150 yrs out. we managed to catch 1 coho and lost 2 others that just peeled line. I was unable to get my rod out of the rod holder in time lol. Both rods were black NK spoons.  Thought that i had to post my accomplishment. thanks for reading and i hope that this report may help you catch the big one. (oh we were trolling between 4-5 km/hr)   thanks  bigredfisher"
