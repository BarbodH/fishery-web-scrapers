372526,ironstone74,2009-08-14 01:00:00,201,"I've had a good run of fishing lately and managed to wet a line 5 days in a row.  I have a young family so I bring them along or hit the water when they'e asleep.  2 evenings on the Grand river, 2 trips to a nearby resevoir/lake, a morning on the Beaver in Thornbury, and a couple of hours on the allegedly ""stocked"" pond at Blue Mountain.  Can't beat a good run of fishing.  What's your streak???  Paul"

372535,tdotfisherman,2009-08-14 01:16:00,317,I took a vacation up north in July where I fished for 13 days straight.. that would have to be my record.  If I won the lottery and could retire and do nothing the rest of my life.. I'd probably fish for like 6 months straight.. at one of my 10 lakefront properties..lol..
372554,NAW,2009-08-14 02:09:00,4022,"If I go way back.  I used to live at the cottage for a few weeks every summer while in high school.  Fished every day.  I guess that would be about 20 days in a row.  Havn't done that in a long time though.  In recent years, the longest would be 7 days while on a camping trip."
372566,bigugli,2009-08-14 02:40:00,6138,"When I was a kid ( can't believe I'm sounding like my uncle  ) we wet lines everyday from last Saturday in June til the end of September.  Started each morning by checking the bait traps. I used to sell a lot of minnows back then.  Then check the night line ( they were allowed back then.)  and making a few casts before breakfast.  Probably went a solid month without breaking that routine, back in the good ole' days  ( another case of 'oldfartitis' setting in  )"
372582,troutologist,2009-08-14 03:06:00,951,"checked the records...74 days in a row.  I now havent fished since July 18th. Probably the longest for the last 5 years.  Funny how it goes, work made me fish for 74 days and now work prevents me from fishing for 25. Is that irony?"
372595,Burning Babies,2009-08-14 03:55:00,150,"Probably about a week.  This year so far, a whopping two days.  I'll get a week straight next month."
372605,solopaddler,2009-08-14 09:49:00,8605,My longest canoe expedition was 115 days and I fished every day to survive..
