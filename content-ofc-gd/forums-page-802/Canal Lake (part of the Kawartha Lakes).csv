Canal Lake is part of the Kawartha Lakes, and closest to Lake Simco. I fished for a brief time while I was there this weekend and caught 4 pounder bass and a medium sizes pike off the dock. I hear there are some nice Muskie lurking this lake as well, has anyone fished this lake and know some hot spots or maybe could share some tips and stories about this area? Thanks in advanced!"

372388,Jonaton,2009-08-13 17:24:00,72,"Canal Lake is filled with hammerhandle pike, like infested, if there are any muskies left in the lake i don't know anyone who has caught one in a while. But there is good bass fishing and the pike while small can keep you entertained, who knows maybe there are a few muskies left."
