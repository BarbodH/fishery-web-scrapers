I have only gone fishing once in my life, that was last summer in Hamilton I think and caught some catfish,really enjoyed the whole experience and now that I'm older I'm looking to fish more often. So me and a few buddies of mine want to go fishing before the school year starts maybe sometime this weekend. The problem is that we don't actually know where to go around Mississauga. I have tried googleing but the sites just makes it more confusing with zones, areas and restrictions. I wanted to ask you guys if you have any suggestions on good locations to go fishing (example parks) and have a good time around Mississauga. I don't want to try down/up stream fishing or on a boat but just a place that's easy to get to relax and fish at the spot for beginners with fish  .  I am going to buy some rods from Canadian tire in a few days but also need to know where to get the bait and what else is needed. Another question I have is some of us are under 18 while others are over so do we all need to have fishing licenses? Ive heard that if ur under 18 u dont need a license but do you need to be with others that are over 18 and with a fishing license?"
371500,danbo,2009-08-11 04:35:00,2646,Try the Big Lake south of ya!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_CgwtyYIm8...feature=related
371502,ciceri,2009-08-11 04:51:00,535,"If you are under 18, you can fish without a license and don't need to be with someone that does. Those that are 18 and over will need to purchase a license."
371504,Ziki,2009-08-11 05:23:00,128,try lake aquatine in meadowvale
371531,Marko,2009-08-11 11:14:00,854,I would try at the mouth of Credit. There should be some fish in there and plenty of space for you to fish before the salmon season starts.
371562,The Birdfish,2009-08-11 12:52:00,73,"Try the mouth of the credit, for smallies and pike, I would purchase some simple spinner baites to get you started, they will catch all sorts of species!!! Another suggestion is go down to the Bronte in Oakville same thing there!!"
371567,highdrifter,2009-08-11 13:20:00,2534,Where for art thou A2F???!!
371568,bigzinc10,2009-08-11 13:20:00,38,"I am new to the fishing game as well and also live in the brampton mississauga area. I tried fishing at erindale park near UTM, but that was pretty difficult considering it is a river wth fast running water. I went to lake aquitaine in meadowvale and it was disappointing; you can only catch small catch fish and other fish species that are very small.  Only real success I have had is at Prof Lake in Brampton....I have caught plenty rock bass of decent size and large mouths in 1-1.5lbs range.  I havent tried Bronte but I heard its decent.  Check the ministry of natural resources ontario website but I do believe that if you are under 16 it is free. Anyone over 16 and under 65 needs to be licenced. I have a licence but have never been asked for it, so you may be able to get away with it at some spots.  I would suggest buying some small spinners and also some jerk baits like power grubs from canadian tire. I have had most of my catches using those.  Dollarama also sells things such as split shots, spinners and spoons...so if cost is an issue check there too.  Best of luck   "
371577,rbaquial,2009-08-11 13:48:00,968, LOLOLOL!!  Right here bud!  Try PORT CREDIT (Hurontario and Lakeshore)... there's a bridge there... try fishing around the mouth
371584,bigzinc10,2009-08-11 14:04:00,38,I went there last week and tried fishing the pier area with no luck....is memorial park the area you are talking about??  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source...=17&iwloc=A   
371585,GBW,2009-08-11 14:04:00,8460,the last thing you want to do is get busted with no licence!  It's doesn't cost much at all for a licence so why chance it?  as for spot's I can't help as I'm out in the East end...  but different size and colour spinner baits is a good call.  try the R bend and the inline one's.  you can also use heavy line and a jig with a stick bait...
371588,Marko,2009-08-11 14:06:00,854,I thought you`d have to be younger then 16 to fish without a license but that might have changed in the last  10 years lol.
371591,bigzinc10,2009-08-11 14:10:00,38,"You're right GBW. I wouldnt fish without a licence....but a couple of my buddies do, and I have told them its unwise...my words fall on deaf ears.....i guess they wil change once they get caught....by the way what are the penalties for fishign with no licence?? Itried looking it up on the ministry site, but couldnt find anything. "

371805,GBW,2009-08-12 00:16:00,8460,"You can have EVERYTHING involved with your day taken away.  IE, you drove to the spot (car can be taken), your bait, lures, rod, reel and have to fight to get it back.  If I find it later I will post unless another member posts it for me (time to put the kid's to bed so no PC for a while )"
