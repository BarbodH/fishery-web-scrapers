372520,Radnine,2009-08-14 00:44:00,1538,"What a day! The winds finally laid down and the water was flatter than pee on a plate. I was lucky enough to hook with a fellow OFC'er and grab some smallies out of Maitland.  These two were caught on a watermelon/chartreuse YUM Dinger rigged wacky with an O-ring.     This one was the smallest of the lot but fought like he was going to the chair. It was caught on a Strike King Bleeding Tube (3.5"") in Dark Melon Perch     I attribute my success to wearing my PFD at all times and my darned smart looking hat. Good to get out with you Homeslice. Jim"

372539,HTHM,2009-08-14 01:30:00,4082,"I truly enjoyed being your net man today *sigh* and photographer and ......*sobs* But I most enjoyed the time on the water and I learned that there are actually other places to fish rather than the grand between erie and the dam. If ever you would like a repeat performance, just call."
