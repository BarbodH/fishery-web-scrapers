372340,Fang,2009-08-13 14:54:00,1330,1 treble should be fine if your just hanging it. Watch the regs as there's a limit on quick strike rigs and trebles in there somewhere.  I usually just run 2 single hooks just in under the skin - top of head and side just behind the dorsal fin. I think size 1's or 2's. I like the slightly bigger walleye hooks (about quarter size) as the hook points tend to stay out open in the bait
