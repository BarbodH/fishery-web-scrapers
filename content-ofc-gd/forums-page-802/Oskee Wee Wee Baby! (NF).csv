372074,solopaddler,2009-08-12 19:55:00,8605,"I'm a huge Ticats fan. Been suffering for a looong time, man oh man does this year feel good!  Anyone else out there a closet Cats fan?  Perhaps an OFC gathering at Ivor Wynn sometime this season?"
372076,Mike Pike,2009-08-12 20:01:00,1332,"Not a closet fan here, Solo, but a darn proud one!  I wear my black and gold to work and everywhere.  I've had seasons tickets for a few years now so I'm enjoy this year as much as you are!  Did you go to the Edmonton game on the weekend Solo?  That was awesome!!!!!!!!  OSKEE WEE WEE!"
372087,solopaddler,2009-08-12 20:15:00,8605," Right on dude! I was going to bring my daughter but the weather forecast scared me away (she's only 5). Had a great time watching it though, man what a downpour!  Someone called me late in the 4th right when Cobb ran in for that touchdown and I literally whipped the phone on the ground LOL!"
372101,Radnine,2009-08-12 20:43:00,1538,I'm a Ticat fan too. Oskee-bloody-weewee. Now where was that lake you flew in to? Jim

372115,kickingfrog,2009-08-12 21:37:00,8333,"Sorry Mike, maybe I should have told you that I am an Argo fan  Anybody remember the last time the both the Argos and the Ticats were having good years??? At the same time???"
372122,solopaddler,2009-08-12 21:55:00,8605,  Yech! A fan of the Blew team are ya?  My excitement over the Cats season is matched only by my glee in seeing the Blew team fall to pieces.  (BTW thanks for Bruce glad he's now a Cat.  )
372128,bigugli,2009-08-12 22:11:00,6138,"Sorry, not a fan of the Neutered kittens  Used to be an Argo fan, but then again, my coach was an ex-Argo."
372129,solopaddler,2009-08-12 22:18:00,8605,  You have my deepest sympathies.
372132,kickingfrog,2009-08-12 22:36:00,8333," Keep 'em. Two bit yankee receivers are a dime a dozen.  I don't really care if the Ticats win, as long as the Argos finish 1 point ahead of them and win the head to head games.  BTW I'd love to see a CFL  game in Hamilton, way better atmosphere than the dome. I have tickets for the Argo/Ticats game the week after Labour day. Seemed like a good idea back in June."
372135,solopaddler,2009-08-12 22:48:00,8605, Have to admit I've never been impressed with his antics but he's got talent. Not too often you can pick up a perrenial all star and a legit deep thread from your rival team for nothing LOL! (9 catches in his 2nd full game as a Cat last week? Not too shabby  )    Prepare yourself for some serious dissapointment my friend.    Ahh there's a glimmer of hope for you after all!
372204,knightfisher,2009-08-13 01:47:00,237,"Diehard Ti - Cat fan.  I remember when I was a kid at one of the Cats Grey Cup parades, one of the players ran over to me and gave me a football. Plus growing up in Hammy town, how could I not be a fan.  Goooooooooooooo Cats  Ti-Cat -argo games in Hamiton are usually good. My fave however was some years back when both teams in the playoffs had to score the most points in two games. Agros took the first game in Hamilton with a pretty good lead, the following week, in Toronto, Hamilton kicked butt and won the series."
372213,solopaddler,2009-08-13 02:03:00,8605," I remember that game vividly, 1986, with a rookie Mike Kerrigan at quarterback. They went on to win the Grey Cup that year."
372236,knightfisher,2009-08-13 02:34:00,237,"Yes they did and it was sweet. Losing the previous two Grey Cups in as many years, the underdog Cats totally decimated the Esks. Was a great game.  Great to see the Cats back in winning form with a good defense."
372246,solopaddler,2009-08-13 02:51:00,8605," When they get Floyd, Adams and Long back it'll be a dominating defense.  Definitely nice to see it's be a long last few years."
372277,holdfast,2009-08-13 06:01:00,1813,"Should be a good game this weekend against SK.  Got a feeling your running game is going to defeat us/ heard it was pretty good this year.  BTW I stopped watching football way back when the Als became the Concords than folded till I moved here.  Its true, The Green machine and the Football craze has rejuvenated me.  HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW"
372307,Mike Pike,2009-08-13 12:53:00,1332,"I live just a few blocks from Ivor Wynne so I can walk to the games, which is a good thing due to our pre-game 'festivities.'  LOL  The atmoshpere in the hood on a game day is great.  Everyone dressed in the black and gold, parking on lawns, tailgating at Scott Park, etc.  Love it.  Things will change( probably for the better )if we get a new stadium by the lake.  I just hope it's as intimate as Ivor Wynne.  I feel sorry for fans of the blue team who have that concrete cavern to watch games from or Edmonton who have a running track between them and the field.  Owner Bob Young has given the old girl a make over and it's a terrific place to watch a game from."
372402,pikehunter,2009-08-13 18:04:00,1659,It's about bloody time they figured out what that oblong ball all the other teams were playing with is for!
372423,bdox,2009-08-13 19:01:00,329," Watch out for Cobb, he's on fire!"
372594,jjcanoe,2009-08-14 03:50:00,744,"grew up in Niagara and always been a Ti-cats fan, although haven't really followed them closely in the past few years.  Did you know that the Ti-Cats are the ONLY TEAM IN NORTH AMERICAN PRO SPORTS to have won their League championships (ie Grey cup, Stanley cup, World series etc.) at least once in every decade in the last century?  Need to get to work though to carry the streak over to this century!  jjCATnoe"
