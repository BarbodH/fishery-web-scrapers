The concern is that she has in floor heating (not sure what type at the moment if it matters) and will need to use a self leveling compound before laying tiles.  Her concern is that it would be too much ""stuff"" covering the heating and having it not work properly or too much as a result.  Does anyone here have any knowledge on this or experience??  Thanks for your help  Maureen"

372543,rickster,2009-08-14 01:43:00,495,no worries I have in floor heat in my house and have tile in both bathrooms the laundry and both entrances. Very warm floors  Rick

372579,splashhopper,2009-08-14 03:02:00,2931,"should be no problem.... UNLESS she turns the heat on too soon after the self leveling compound was poured. This also pertains to any thinset used to set the tiles.  wait at least 30 days to turn the heat on in the floor.  If she doesn't... she risk the possibility of the leveling compound ""powdering out""  Splashhopper aka www.TheGroutDoctor.ca"
