372173,Greencoachdog,2009-08-13 00:19:00,8163,It's a ripoff for an underwater light (they want $200) that you can buy at Cabelas for $40
372174,solopaddler,2009-08-13 00:21:00,8605,  You actually clicked on the link?
372178,Greencoachdog,2009-08-13 00:33:00,8163,  It's a very old ad that has been around under several different titles.
372181,solopaddler,2009-08-13 00:38:00,8605,  How do you know it's the same product unless you clicked the link?  C'mon admit it that banner tantalized you.
372184,Greencoachdog,2009-08-13 00:45:00,8163,"  Nope, it has been the ""evening secret"", then the ""walleye secret"", then the ""crappie secret""... and now it's back to the ""evening secret"""
372187,solopaddler,2009-08-13 00:53:00,8605, Yeah yeah  . You wouldn't know that unless you clicked on the link.

372226,TC1OZ,2009-08-13 02:17:00,987,  I've been clicking for over an hour...still no PORNADO.  False advertising!
372249,solopaddler,2009-08-13 02:56:00,8605," AH HAHAHA! ""Pornado"""

It is an ad for a light. We don't have porn ads here...though I am sure it would push revenue up quite a bit, however the loss in traffic wouldn't be worth it....lol."
372453,misfish,2009-08-13 21:30:00,29133, Glenn has finaly seen the light.
