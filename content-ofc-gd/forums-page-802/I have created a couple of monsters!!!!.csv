372200,msp,2009-08-13 01:40:00,1336,"Two weeks ago I decided to take the kids out bass fishing......one at a time. The results were personal bests for each kid. Gotta love circle hooks and senkos. My oldest daughter and I with two healthy largies. A P.B. for her.   Next day I decided to take my youngest daughter to my go to spot. I gave her a spinning rod and directed her where to cast. Fish on! A personal best for her,reeled in all by herself.   Now for my favorite fishing moment of all time......... Took my three year old boy out bass'n for the first time. We pulled up to a great weedline and I picked up the spinning gear. I did a long bomb cast as far as I could and handed the rod off to the little guy. ""Wait and let it sink "" I said to my young apprentice. As I picked up my flipping stick, I pitched out a black jig into a thick weed patch and boom......Fish on! A dink 2 pounder for Dad. ""Daddy, Daddy, I think I got one"" my son says. Thinking that he was caught up on weeds, I doubted that he had a fish on.....untill I heard the drag peeling. I immediatly dropped the flipping stick and helped my guy boat his first bass. A very proud moment for Dad !   Its going to be tough to beat those P.B's for the kids and I told them that the fishing is not always that easy. I will be back at it this weekend. Oh yeah.....all fish were realeased at dockside"
