615846,rhymobot,2011-08-26 15:43:00,174,Hi.  I got my new trolling motor (Minn Kota 30lb thrust) and new deep cycle battery. The manual for the troller says I should buy a circuit breaker to prevent damage.  How necessary is this and how many of you use one with your trolling motor?  Thanks.
615847,bushart,2011-08-26 15:45:00,2628,I do  Mine has a block that is at the battery connection--pos
615848,scugpg,2011-08-26 15:46:00,1373,"""should"" should be a ""must"" in the manual.  They can be had around 8-12 dollars at NAPA"
615850,tightline,2011-08-26 16:06:00,322,Great idea everytime!!! 8-12 bucks beats blown troller 10 out of 10 times
615930,rhymobot,2011-08-26 18:45:00,174,Thanks.  I wanna buy one and use it by tomorrow. NAPA is closed by 6 today and that's when I'm getting off the train from work so I can't go there. And tomorrow morn I'm driving from north Brampton across to Lake Wilcox in Richmond Hill and there's no NAPA in between.  Any other ideas on where to get one? CT or BPS?
615942,bushart,2011-08-26 19:16:00,2628,A marine dealer will have them I'm sure
615944,jimmer,2011-08-26 19:21:00,2730,"I have never used one on mine and have never had a problem in twenty years or more. I would probably use one if it was all wired through the boat though. So if it's simple transom mount, I'm sure you would be fine until you can get one rigged up. I will not be held responsible for any damages that might occur from my comments."
615947,Roy,2011-08-26 19:35:00,13728,Hey it's not rocket science. It's a fuse/breaker on the red wire of your trolling motor as close to the battery as convenient. That all!
615966,Tybo,2011-08-26 20:15:00,1373,"Where can I get 8-12 dollar breaker. The water tight low vibration,manual set ones I use are 50-70 dollars."
615973,mercman,2011-08-26 20:49:00,7054,"CTC. 7.95. Fuse holder with an automobile fuse of the correct AMP rating.On the end of your red wire, just before battery. Buy a few spare fuses and put them in your tackle box.  "
615975,Fishnwire,2011-08-26 20:56:00,983,"Wow.  I've been using a new MinKota I just bought for a couple of weeks now and never even thought of that.  Considering I'm an electrician, that's a little embarrassing.  I was on my way to Canadian tire anyway, I guess I'll put that on the list."
615982,rhymobot,2011-08-26 21:10:00,174,Thanks guys  Ya I've used mine 5 times now then I noticed it in the manual.
616156,scugpg,2011-08-27 10:04:00,1373,I've used the grey colored ones with the two screw terminals for years with no issue. Get the manual reset one.
616193,hirk,2011-08-27 13:28:00,571,"You should get a 50amp reset breaker not a inline fuse holder,cost $9-10 bucks"
