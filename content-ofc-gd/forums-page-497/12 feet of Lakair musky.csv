614612,Moosebunk,2011-08-23 01:52:00,3970,"You don't have to make us wait another 3 years or so Lew.  That was great, well deserved."
614618,musky_man,2011-08-23 02:15:00,159,"Hey Lew,  Looks like a heck of a trip -  despite being retired, I've only managed a few hours musky fishing and one fish ... had some nice follows, but no other takers.  Take care,  mark"
614621,targaboy175,2011-08-23 02:30:00,76,wowowowo nice catch & trip man !!
614623,irishfield,2011-08-23 02:38:00,26272,Nice stuff Lew.... thanks for confirming that we're not always chasin ghosts !
614648,lew,2011-08-23 09:41:00,12766," Some days they can seem as elusive as ghosts Wayne, but their in there, ya just gotta go dig em out"
614661,DT10Sam,2011-08-23 11:10:00,480,Way to go Lew.............. nice to see your still smiling in your pics.
614686,OhioFisherman,2011-08-23 12:38:00,6623,"Great pictures and report Lew, LOL a week to get 12 feet of Muskie? You need a 50 or 60 feet of bass day."
614695,lew,2011-08-23 12:55:00,12766, I just can't get excited about spending all day fish'n for bait though Paul
614699,Lungelarry,2011-08-23 12:59:00,294,"Thats a tough place to catch muskies,but you have the knowledge and experience to make it look easy   Well deserved,you EARNED it."
614702,lew,2011-08-23 13:06:00,12766,"Thanks Larry, but as you well know, it's not always as easy as it looks sometimes, but it means alot coming from you."
614708,OhioFisherman,2011-08-23 13:25:00,6623, Ya there is a different feel when you set the hook on a torpedo.
614732,Harrison,2011-08-23 14:57:00,2202,"There's a Lew post for ya, been a while.  Guatanteed good fish, details of the techniques, a scenery shot and no smile.  Glad to see your got into them and shared with us Lew.  But, your full of bird droppings, evening bite? your in bed by 3:30pm to be up at Lew oclock.  Nice try."
614751,johnnyb,2011-08-23 15:30:00,3413,"I just re-read your technical info again, Lew....actually re-re-re-read it ...good stuff to keep in mind.  One question -- do you pay attention to water temperature?  If so, have you found more active fish in a certain temperature range?  The reason I thought of it was that you were in 7-8FOW....I would've thought that would be pretty warm for big fish like that....so I thought I'd ask"
614762,Whopper,2011-08-23 15:47:00,2174,Contrary to most people's belief he does smile once at a while 
614775,lew,2011-08-23 16:42:00,12766,"Hey Phil, your gonna spoil my image posting those kinda pictures    johnny, if the water temps are up in the 80 degree or above range I'll use cranks and try and focus on deeper fish where the water is cooler.  Where I was fishing up north last week the water was in the 77-78 degree range for the 1st couple days, then the nights began to get quite cool and the surface temps dropped to the low to mid 70's, infact on 2 mornings the water was 69 when we headed out.  7-9 FOW is pretty consistant in that area and so the temps also average about the same overall."
614782,Millhouse2020,2011-08-23 16:58:00,152,Great report Lew!  Hoping to get out myself as the water begins to cool...
614891,skeeter,2011-08-23 22:33:00,1907,Way to go Lew. Great report. Now Daniel and I are getting excited about going up there on the long weekend in 2 weeks.
614961,trapshooter,2011-08-24 02:35:00,1234,Way to go Lew!  Awesome muskies.  I got a good war wound this year myself... too bad it wasn't from a 50 incher though!
615007,johnnyb,2011-08-24 12:57:00,3413,  Thanks Lew....really appreciate it
615033,Breakrz,2011-08-24 13:54:00,2,DANG!!!!  thats what it's all about.
615147,Spiel,2011-08-24 17:56:00,9065,"I've read the report a few times now Lew hoping to come up with a word other than ""awesome"" but alas ""awesome"" it is!"

614082,Rich Clemens,2011-08-21 20:54:00,3131,Great to see you having that kind of success up there Lew.   This must have been the year for producing some nice fish.    3 years for a report - well worth the way.   I'm already anxious about getting back up there next year.
614109,danc,2011-08-21 22:01:00,4677,Great report Lew. Those are some awesome fish. Don't let us wait three more years for the next one..

614190,Marty,2011-08-22 01:54:00,873,I really enjoyed that Lew.   Thanks.
614245,lew,2011-08-22 10:11:00,12766,Thanks again for all your thoughts folks.   Was really hoping you woulda been up there this past June Marty. We've been talking about hooking up for a musky for a long time now but can never seem to make it happen.
614246,lew,2011-08-22 10:15:00,12766," Sure wish I was heading back up with you guys Joey and good luck to you & Paul. Hopefully their still on the prowl.  See you folks down at St. Clair in a couple months....again, hopefully."
614251,Daplumma,2011-08-22 11:14:00,1961,"Good to see the fish cooperated,I see you had the best cabin in the camp.Recipe for a great week. Joe"

614264,Joey,2011-08-22 12:19:00,9122,"  You bet Lew, looking forward to it  And thanks, hope they are as cooperative as they were for you up there"
614277,bigbuck,2011-08-22 12:41:00,2449,Great report Lew!!! I guess I have to put the West Arm on my bucket list.
614300,F_ast,2011-08-22 13:15:00,154,Hey Lew... Nice fish for sure.  I'll take a bunch of 48s and a 50 any day... or week long trip.  Question;  What was the later level like? I'm hearing the French is low.
614308,johnnyb,2011-08-22 13:39:00,3413,Great stuff....and great info!  Those are some seriously impressive fish
614363,lew,2011-08-22 14:55:00,12766," Absolutely Bob, but it's hard to keep those big girls on the BBQ spit"
614366,lew,2011-08-22 15:01:00,12766," The levels on the West Arm are down a bit from normal, I'd say maybe 8""-10"", but the water is in great shape and the weed growth is excellent and VERY healthy."
614416,ehg,2011-08-22 16:38:00,2666,Thanks for taking the time and putting together this report. The FWIW at the end has a ton of useful insight for musky hunting.
614537,Squid,2011-08-22 21:55:00,1656,"Awesome fishing gang!! The Muskies look really healthy and clean Lew, WTG!!!"
613975,lew,2011-08-21 12:52:00,12766,"Hi guys, I've been up at Lakair on the West Arm of Nippissing with my wife and daughter for the past 2 weeks and just got home yesterday.  I haven't posted a fishing report in about 3 years so figured I was due for one  The weather was excellent and so was the pike & musky fishing.  I don't fish for pike myself but the ladies were sure having fun with them and caught plenty although most of them were small with a few being in the 24 inch range.  Here's the Misses between hits    It's un-believable how aggressive those little slimers can be and they'll hit just about anything that passes their nose including very large double 12 bucks.    My daughter Sheri taking a well deserved break from a day on the water    The reason I spend 2-3 weeks on the West Arm every year though is the musky fishing. Their tough to locate sometimes but when their on, their REALLY on and this year was excellent !!  There was a full moon a week ago and the sunset and moon rise times were  pretty close and the fish were very active in the evenings for a couple days either side of it.  I boated 3 gooduns, lost another large fish about 20' out and had a 50"" class follow me right to the boat on a figure 8 but then spooked and wouldn't return.  1st fish was a 48 incher    2nd fish was another 48    And the 3rd was a nice hefty 50 incher.    We always enjoy our time on the West Arm and have already booked a couple weeks at Lakair again next August.  Our cabin this year    And the view from the deck alot of evenings     For what it's worth....  All 5 muskies were encountered in the evenings near sunset.  All 5 muskies were encountered in open water far away from any rocks.  All 5 muskies were encountered during a brisk EASTERLY wind. Don't ever let anyone tell you fish don't bite when the wind is from the east.  All 5 muskies were within 1/4 mile of each other.  All 5 muskies were caught in 7-8 FOW in heavy cabbage patches.  All 5 muskies were caught with a very large black spinnerbait with double orange blades.  The  4 fish I hooked all hit the bait within the 1st couple seconds of the bait hitting the water.  The 50 incher sliced a hole in my hand that made me bleed enuff to make the deck of my boat look like a war zone.....but it was worth every drop"
