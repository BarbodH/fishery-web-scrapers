The owner was telling the police that the cash and frozen meat were stolen along with a bushel basket of peaches. The police noticed that there was a trail of peaches leaving the store and going down the road. They followed the trail of peaches which lead them to the house of the burglars a few doors down. The bushel basket had a hole in the bottom dropping peaches as they walked away. Now if all crimes were that easy to solve.

His daughter noticed someone peeking into her basement bedroom window late one night as she was getting undressed. She shrieked, the guy ran, and my buddy called the police. They turned up, looked at the window, and then at the shoe-prints in the fresh dusting of snow, which they then followed directly back to the guy's front door less than a block away."
