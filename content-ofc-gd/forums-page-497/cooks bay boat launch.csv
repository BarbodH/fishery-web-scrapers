616194,mattp33,2011-08-27 13:28:00,290,"I am heading to simcoe tomorrow morning, can I still launch at gilfod beach?  I want to fish cooks bay but I am unsure of where to launch.  I dont mind paying but I remember years ago we launched at the end of hwy 89 I think.  Form the map it looks like gilford beach and it was free.  Thanks"
616198,davey buoy,2011-08-27 13:41:00,5505,"Yes it's still free,but you have to park on the far west street from the launch.A lot of no parking areas now.You will see the vehicles there as you drive in on your right side."
616210,mattp33,2011-08-27 14:22:00,290,Thanks
616241,mattp33,2011-08-27 17:15:00,290,How much wind will keep a 17 ft bass boat off of simcoe?  They are calling for 15-20 km winds tomorrow.  I am a little nervous about going tomorrow
616242,Terry,2011-08-27 17:19:00,14456,if the wind is coming from the west and your launching on the west side you will be fine
616244,mattp33,2011-08-27 17:26:00,290,"The weather network claims it will be out of the north/ northwest.  I am going to launch in cooks bay and wanted to fish the islands.  Wont know till we try i guess.  Worst case, we fish near shore for the buckets!"
616247,RickOnt,2011-08-27 17:51:00,669,"20 Klick winds from the NW will make a run out to Fox a little Bumpy for sure!  As Terry said the West launch should be OK and work the West shoreline if the Lake is rolling.  The end of Gilford Rd is free, gravel, and no dock.  Monte Reno Marina at the 4th Line, which is Lefroy, is a concrete ramp with dock but it is 15 or 17 dollars.  Rick"
616249,mattp33,2011-08-27 18:21:00,290,Thanks Rick.  I think I will make a change and just head to scugog.  I dont know simcoe well enough to deal with 20 km winds all day.
616254,LefroyFisherman,2011-08-27 19:39:00,602,"Even 10-15k winds in the wrong direction can make Simcoe a pain in the ass, been out there a couple times white knuckled"
616258,misfish,2011-08-27 19:50:00,29133,"Smart move Matt. Like you said,if you dont know Simcoe dont go. This is part of the season where Simcoe can get stupid. Calm,calm, then blow up.Been there,not fun.  Good luck on the Bog."
616287,NAW,2011-08-27 23:00:00,4022,"I herd on the news the day was to start off with NW winds, changing to N winds later in the day.  That'll make a mess of cooks bay.  Good decision on switching it up.."
