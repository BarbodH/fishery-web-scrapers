Anyways, I would rather fish with company rather than alone.  Any takers out there?  Fishing for bass going to try to be on the water for 8 or earlier. I'm leaving from Orangeville so if you are on the way I would be more than happy to do a pick up.  "

Got a few smaller bass.  Then I switched to my little known secret weapon the chatter bait.  Had a few little ones hook up.  Lost a monster that hit, jumped, then came straight at me like a frieght train!  Good times, good compan    Thanks GoneFishin!  We will do it againg soon!  Oh ya I blame it on the earthquake"
