615950,vance,2011-08-26 19:37:00,719,"A couple of hours ago I was driving south on 11 just out of North bay when I saw a large white Ford towing a flat bed trailer with a smallish float plane on it with out wings or motor and wrapped in plastic going north,and I thought I wonder if that was Irishfield   vance"
615953,Roy,2011-08-26 19:40:00,13728,Hard to miss a 53 foot float.
615955,vance,2011-08-26 19:46:00,719,With the guard rails it was has to see the trailer but SPARKLY white Fords being pushed by engine less planes are hard to miss  :rofl2:    vance
616036,irishfield,2011-08-26 23:14:00,26272,"Wasn't me... Daughter #2 had me on fabrication duty. With 3 hours notice she needed a canoe holder for her boyfriends truck so they could load and go tonight. No wonder I can't get anything, paying, accomplished around here ! "
616044,Pigeontroller,2011-08-26 23:33:00,2793,"Wayne, that sure ain't no work of art!"
616045,irishfield,2011-08-26 23:35:00,26272,Sorry Dax... didn't have time for paint!
616048,Twocoda,2011-08-26 23:49:00,4130,if they cant find you handsome....might as well find ya handy?....daughter #2 must have a handsome boyfriend
616050,Terry,2011-08-26 23:52:00,14456,so why do the curved support rods seem to be bolted not wielded or is it both and I can't see the wields on the angle iron
616054,irishfield,2011-08-26 23:58:00,26272,"You know how hard it is to weld a round tube to a square tube.. I tacked them at the end and then drilled and bolted. I'd had enough at that point.  I just threw it together with crap I had in the hangar. I've had the round pipe.. welded to the 2 x 2 square tube kicking around for about 20+ years. Like they say.. never throw anything out, you may need it next week (or decade). The curved tubes.. again I have a bucket full of them. Some very expensive Norseman aircraft preformed parts... that I found a use for!"
616059,misfish,2011-08-27 00:01:00,29133,"When they return Wayne,send them done my way. I,ll give it the final touches."
616078,irishfield,2011-08-27 00:33:00,26272,"Hey Brian, if he had a real truck like mine with a super cab he wouldn't need the thing.. unlike the single pickup cab and short box of his GMC !"
616147,Nipfisher,2011-08-27 04:29:00,2449,  The muffler clamps make it look shiney.
616148,irishfield,2011-08-27 04:31:00,26272,They're just worm clamps... I blew the crap out of the thinner tube on the bent pipes vs the 3/16 wall main vertical tube when TIG'ng it and just wanted to be sure they get there and back without it letting go.
616149,irishfield,2011-08-27 04:39:00,26272,..and for future reference... this is what my trailer looks like loaded! 
616166,pikehunter,2011-08-27 11:26:00,1659,"Been there done that. Usually hang onto stuff...just in case. Though sometimes I get ambitious, or stupid you might call it, and do a shop cleaning.  I cannot believe how many small pieces of trim get returned to the Home Depot...couple days ago I look at a return cart and there it was, a 1 foot piece of primed 1/4 round...something like .49 cents ! Other times 2 feet of this or 3 feet of that. I would have never ever thought anyone would return trim or even a 2x4 until my stint at the H.D. Keep it! Ya never know! I needed sme 3/4"" cove one day, guess what I found a piece, had it for about 15 years, but I had it, and it was even mahogony! Can't even buy that species anymore!  Nice canoe rack Wayne."
