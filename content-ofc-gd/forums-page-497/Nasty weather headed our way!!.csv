615332,danbouck,2011-08-25 02:50:00,4380," Long story short... Yes, i was TRYING to get away from it. Never seen anything like it before. A wall of water out of nowhere and more wind than i have ever seen. If it wasn't a tornado than i couldn't even imagine one"
615333,Handlebarz,2011-08-25 03:04:00,3790,Been nothing but lightning here in Chatham since 9pm or earlier now they just said take cover so I had to check OFC LOL we are watching BB13 and hope that the roof stays on the house. the thunder just got the dog off the couch so he is making his rounds of the house to be sure things are OK. Hope everyone makes it through this storm system tonight.

I got some great video from my mom's 10th floor balcony tonight, just uploading to Youtube.  I'll post them later when they're done.  Heck of a storm, not much wind here though!"

It's funny tho, I tell my mom the power just went out up the hill and she says, the power may be out here soon, how are you on going down 10 flights of stairs     Then she says maybe we should go in and after that a lightening bolt goes between the balcony we are on and the building close to us.  Yep, time to go in  "

615709,ehg,2011-08-26 01:51:00,2666,"According to that link one (F-1) confirmed tornado so far. Happened around Burlington. More reports to be investigated.  That was the most incredible display of lightening here in T.O. ever. At least 3 hrs of constant, close strikes."
615717,ccmtcanada,2011-08-26 02:05:00,7971,Joey...great videos!  Strike between the two buildings?  Yikes!  I heard on the news they reported 500 strikes of lightning every 2 minutes.  Was unbelievable.  A few were right above me and the thunder scared the crap out of me as it shook the house and rattled window panes.  The ceiling light in my room was off...but glowed softly for about 20 seconds...I bolted and ran until it stopped lol!
615725,Joey,2011-08-26 02:19:00,9122,  Okay that's just freaky Cliff

615842,Nipfisher,2011-08-26 15:34:00,2449,"More info on the confirmed tornado.  Environment Canada has confirmed that a tornado touched down near Cambridge, Ont., on Wednesday night as wild weather swept across southern Ontario.  An F1 tornado with winds between 120 km/h and 170 km/h was confirmed southeast of Cambridge, located about 90 kilometres west of Toronto.  Environment Canada said the tornado touched down just after 9 p.m. ET at Little's Corners and tracked 15 kilometres southeast to Westover.  The path of the tornado was up to 300 metres wide at times.  An agency investigator was sent to the Burlington area to check whether damage there was caused by a tornado, but that event has been classified as a downburst.  There were also reports of possible tornadoes and funnel clouds in parts of eastern Lambton County, Middlesex County, Huron-Perth and Bruce counties.  "

615121,ccmtcanada,2011-08-24 16:26:00,7971,"Thanks for the heads up!  Interesting that they'd go straight to the tornado watch instead of a severe thunderstorm watch first.  They generally look at storm cells with rotation and a hook before issuing tornado watches and warnings.  The system hasn't even developed yet...they are ""expecting"" it to this afternoon as a cold front sweeps through."
615138,fishing n autograph,2011-08-24 17:24:00,2540,Better safe than sorry I guess. I don't think its a bad thing to be too prepared especially for the worst
615141,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-24 17:27:00,4399,Nothing on the radar yet!
615145,kickingfrog,2011-08-24 17:33:00,8333,"My perception (take that for what it might be worth) is that after a tornado they tend to issue watches/warnings a little more readily for a while. They run the risk of people not taking the warning seriously though, so they are darned if they do, and darned if they don't."
615160,ehg,2011-08-24 18:29:00,2666,I think you are right. After that F-3 hit Goderich last weekend they seem to have a larger area and way sooner warning of potential. The watch extends from Parry Sound down to Windsor and nothing is to happen still for hours. Maybe nothing will happen even?
615176,Headhunter,2011-08-24 19:11:00,5703,"Just got an email from my wife,who, with my kids, are visiting my father in law as his home in Grand Bend. Sunny right now, but the waves ""are crazy"". They should be one of the first areas to get hit. HH"

615187,ehg,2011-08-24 19:58:00,2666,"Ya, all of southern Ontario east to Belleville/Pembroke now under Tornado watch. Never seen this before. That F-3 last weekend in Goderich really has made them cautious."
615188,ccmtcanada,2011-08-24 20:00:00,7971," I'm somewhat a weather buff and I agree, I haven't seen a Tornado watch that covers such a vast area.  Batten down the hatches just in case everyone!"

615228,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-24 21:33:00,10439,Looks pretty mellow out there. The worst of it has been staying to the North but there is a set of strong cells heading straight towards the Bruce. There's a nasty cell heading for Parry Sound too. Best be battening down the hatches!!!    
615234,newb09,2011-08-24 21:49:00,49, Wow. Amazing! What is the name of that kind of clouds?
615238,ehg,2011-08-24 22:11:00,2666,Those clouds are actually called mammatus. Mammatus are found on the back end of severe thunderstorm complexes only. You might see them today but they don't always occur.
615239,misfish,2011-08-24 22:16:00,29133,Back to the weather...........  Whtas happening in your area??
615243,GBW,2011-08-24 22:24:00,8460,sun and a bit o'wind in Brooklin.
615244,ehg,2011-08-24 22:25:00,2666,Now Tornado warnings for entire Lake Huron shoreline area. Severe thunderstorm warnings for Georgian Bay shores over to Huntsville. Looks like these storms came to fruition. Look out folks....
