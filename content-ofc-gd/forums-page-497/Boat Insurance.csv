615411,anders,2011-08-25 14:22:00,1168,Looking to get boat insurance and just curious to see if there is any recommendations out there from the boat owners that have it?  Thanks!
615412,Oryx,2011-08-25 14:31:00,186,"  I added mine to my home insurance.  The Co-operators have an extra rider on the policy that allows me to do it.  $1000 Ded.  Basic Insurance per yr, Liability was $48.  Fire, theft, Damaga and Liability was $98 yr I have a 93' Fisher SV 3 SC.  Paid around $5k for it,  I am assuming price goes up with the value of the boat though."
615457,bubbles,2011-08-25 16:08:00,591,"Mine has a full policy, paid 8K for the boat, I doubt it's $200 a year."
615461,craigdritchie,2011-08-25 16:15:00,1586,"Just remember, the down side to putting a rider on your house policy is that any claims you make on the boat (like getting a new lower unit after you hit a rock) count as a claim on your house policy, and can result in a rate increase.  It's worth asking about a separate policy altogether."
615581,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-25 19:47:00,10439,When I lived in Ontario my boat ins was through Meadowvale Ins. Brokers and the policy was with Dominion of Canada. Great policy (full replacement cost) and great pricing (300 and change a year on my $20K boat).
615720,brw,2011-08-26 02:11:00,101,"  If I can share an important tip. One item you should be sure you inquire about is uninsured boaters coverage. like uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage for your car, this protects you if you're hit by a boat with little or no liability coverage. Just look around on the water next time and you can figure out that a lot of rigs probably have no insurance on their boat. Given that, and the fact that many boaters don't follow rules for safe boating, this coverage is a no brainer in my humble opinion. And it's cheap--probably less than $50 on your policy. I have 300K coverage on my boat through Boat U.S.  Something to think about and ask your agent about."
