Recently,  during a routine patrol, an RCMP patrolman  parked down the street outside a Legion Hall  just off the main in Gander NF,  CANADA  After last call, the officer  observed a man leaving the Legion Hall. The  gentleman was so intoxicated that he could  barely walk. He then stumbled around the parking  lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly  observing. After what seemed an eternity and  trying his keys on five different vehicles, the  man managed to find his car, which he fell  into.  He  sat there for a few minutes and then threw a  hook and line out the window and seemed to be  trying to catch a fish.. A number of other  patrons paid no attention to  this crazy  drunk as they left the bar and drove  off.  Finally the drunk started the car,  switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine,  dry summer night) flicked the blinkers on and  off a couple of times, honked the horn, and  switched on the headlights.  He then  pulled in the hook and line and moved the  vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little  and then remained still for a few more minutes  as some more of the  other patron vehicles  left. At last, the parking lot was empty; he  pulled out of the parking lot and started to  drive slowly down the road.  The  officer, having patiently waited all this time,  now started up the patrol car, put on the  flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man  over. He performed a breathalyzer test on the  gentleman who cooperated fully, and to his  amazement the breathalyzer indicated no evidence  of the man having consumed any  alcohol at  all!  Dumbfounded, the officer  said, 'I'll have to ask you to accompany me to  Headquarters. This breathalyzer equipment  must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly  proud Newfie, ""Tonight I'm the designated  decoy."""
