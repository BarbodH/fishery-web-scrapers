My Dad and I are hitting Lake O tomorrow for the first time. We have all the gear just hoping for maybe a little advice on depth, speed, lures. Heading out of Bronte. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks"
616027,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-26 22:49:00,10439,While I haven't fished there in years I would doubt that anything has changed. My favorite depths to run lines at this time of year are 27' and 35'. Don't know why it's just where I always started. Run out to about 70 FOW and troll out until you start finding fish (or head towards the pack). Make sure to run cheaters too (extra lures in the water and you cover more depths). Trolling speed is usually in the 1.9 to 2.2 MPH range for me.  Good Luck and post how you do.
