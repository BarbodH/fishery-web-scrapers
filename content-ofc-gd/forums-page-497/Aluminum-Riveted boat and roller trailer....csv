615958,icefisherman,2011-08-26 19:58:00,952,"Aside from everyone's personal preferences is there any factual evidence of roller trailers having negative effect on riveted aluminum boats? I was advised to change my rollers with bunks and would like to research this issue a bit more before making a decision...Boat is 1700 Lund Pro Sport with riveted hull Was quoted $300 for switching from rollers to bunks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
615961,vance,2011-08-26 20:05:00,719,I was told when I bought my boat (riveted aluminum) that rollers would leave dents in the bottom panels between the braces especially if traveling on rough roads.It was also pointed out that the bunks or rollers had to support the transom and the rollers had to be dead on the transom to stop any buckling.  vance
615968,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 20:31:00,4661,I have a 16 foot riveted aluminum boat on a roller trailer...  Love it  No dents  I can launch in a foot of water...  Only downside in my opinion... Rollers are tricky to launch by yourself... Because the boat doesnt stay put... But I've learnt to overcome this obstical...      Edit  My boat is 14 years old...

615979,Dutch,2011-08-26 21:04:00,831,Did the package come with the roller trailer?  I can't recall ever having seen an aluminum boat on a roller trailer.  I'd say convert it to bunks.  Is this a dealer you are buying off?  Perhaps to get an upcharge of $300 for the trailer?
616003,icefisherman,2011-08-26 22:03:00,952," Yes the boat came on a roller trailer. I've actually seen number of Lund (and others) aluminum riveted boats on roller trailers. So not sure how it gets determined but I am sure I am not an exception. A marine shop has advised me on switching to bunks and quoted me on it.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
