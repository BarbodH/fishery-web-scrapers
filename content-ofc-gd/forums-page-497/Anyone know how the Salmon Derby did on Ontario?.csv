615823,Waterfowlr,2011-08-26 15:04:00,19,Just wondered if anyone had seen any results from the Salmon Derby on Lake ONtario?  Always a well run event and some big fish...just seem to have taken a bit of a hit over the last couple years in overall size of fish!

615825,Grimace,2011-08-26 15:07:00,2020,That is the daily update page.  You can go through the weeks and see the results.  The big fish is still 37.44
615835,hookerdown,2011-08-26 15:21:00,110,"Last year there were several fish caught over 39 lbs.   The size is down this year for multiple reasons, but I think it will pick up in a couple of years due to the success of local Pen Projects and gene pool.  On a side note, guys have been catching a lot of shakers this year (salmon under 5 lbs), which in theory will result in a higher number of mature salmon in 2-3 years.  Can't wait for the biggins to return."
