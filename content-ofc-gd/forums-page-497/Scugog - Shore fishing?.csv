I'm in Oshawa for work Friday and thought I may drive up and try my luck for bass, walleye or pearch.  much appreciated.  "
615451,GBW,2011-08-25 15:58:00,8460,Any place close to the Port Perry boat ramp and down to the independent store is decent to fish from shore.  it just depends on what way the wind is blowing.
615505,eman,2011-08-25 17:32:00,101, my main focus would be bass but thanks for the tips.
615670,Kwan,2011-08-26 00:02:00,132,shore bass go early in the morning to the causeway and try your luck.  when i got back to toronto i whipped a floating rap at the same lily pad for 3 nights in a row before a 1 lber came out of the weeds for it... its walleye time.  pm me and we can hook up im a regular there
