615312,Meely,2011-08-25 01:49:00,282,"I can't remember the last time I took advantage of two weeks worth of vacation......  I have been enjoying some time off before I return back to work on Monday.  I decided I would like to get out and do some Musky Hunting with the hopes of letting my girlfriend reel in a ski er two!!  We set sail mid-morning and spent about 4 hours or so on the water. We managed to boat 3 nice skies. Our second one boated was the nicer of the lot. All were caught trolling bright coloured lures. I have to admit, its a nice feeling putting people on fish and watching them experience the thrill of reelin em in!!  I have attached a few pics. Heading back up on Friday for another few days of hunting!!!             Meely"
615315,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 01:53:00,4661,Nice haul...  3 in 4 hours is sweet fishing...
615316,Gregoire,2011-08-25 01:56:00,1397,NIcely done. Some healthy looking fish there.
615317,mercman,2011-08-25 01:57:00,7054,Sweet
615334,rufus,2011-08-25 03:07:00,267,Very nice!
615368,johnnyb,2011-08-25 12:37:00,3413,Way to go!  That's what vacation's all about
615374,lew,2011-08-25 12:59:00,12766,Atta boy Meeley
615377,eman,2011-08-25 13:04:00,101,Nice skiis.........caught on bass tackle????
615383,Beans,2011-08-25 13:18:00,3339, I doubt it...until recent years...Muskie was the only fish Meely and Buckster targetted...  Except the odd crappie or two in the spring...  Nice pictures Mate...   
615385,lew,2011-08-25 13:22:00,12766, Meele's an excellent musky fisherman and I'm just curious as to why you'd ask a question like that ??  We just had a thread on that topic go down the drain yesterday.
615387,Beans,2011-08-25 13:25:00,3339, Seems like we were both offended at that remark Lew...LOL   
615417,bigbuck,2011-08-25 14:44:00,2449,"I think he caught them trolling with his perch gear! Yes I know I'm stirring the pot but what kind of question was that? The passionate muskie guys get bent out of shape because the fish we go for are few and far between and for such an ornery fish, they are quite fragile."
615438,eman,2011-08-25 15:28:00,101,  bass tackle comment was meant as a joke since it caused such a stir yesterday......No harm intended!
615530,ehg,2011-08-25 18:28:00,2666,Very nice that you put your gf on some ski's. That area of Pigeon is my favorite for catching them muskies.
615646,Beans,2011-08-25 23:04:00,3339, Try adding some smiley-face emoticoms to your posts if you are joking so we will know...   
615650,buckster,2011-08-25 23:24:00,530,You're starting to make me think that i don't have to be on board to set up the lines!	Nice fish Z!  
615671,danbouck,2011-08-26 00:03:00,4380,nice! I gotta get a musky one of these days
615701,Pigeontroller,2011-08-26 01:17:00,2793,Good job!
615702,NAW,2011-08-26 01:29:00,4022,I wish I could put my wife on 3 ski's in 4 hours.  Thank god she's happy with a few pike in a weekend trip.  Great job man! good on ya.
615741,Meely,2011-08-26 03:32:00,282,"Thanks folks!! and no.....they were all caught on MUSKY GEAR!!!!  No offence taken .... My skin has thickened over the past few years  I'm heading back up Friday morning for a day or two and hope to get back out there!!  Dan, let me know if you want to""hook-up"" for a day!!
