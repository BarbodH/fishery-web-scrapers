They have also given me the opportunity to fish with some of my favourite fishing partners â€“ and truly enjoy what the great outdoors has to offer.  August 24, 2011  This was one outing I was definitely looking forward to. With my good friend Christine Cope moving out west in just over a week, getting out on the water for our last time this season was something we both relished. And although Mother Nature threw everything she had at us, we (or should I say Christine) came out triumphant in the end.    To read the rest of this report, and two others, and to view all of the photos, check out my Website/Blog at:  http://www.justinhoffmanoutdoors.wordpress.com  Good Fishing,  Justin"
