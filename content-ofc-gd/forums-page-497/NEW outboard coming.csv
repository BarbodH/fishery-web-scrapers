On Tuesday I got to test drive a prototype of a brand new outboard that will be introduced to the public next February at the Miami International Boat Show. The first ones will be available for purchase next spring.  It's an awesome outboard, but I can't say a whole lot about it - to get the test drive, I had to agree to a gag order. Most of the manufacturer's dealers haven't even seen it yet. What I can tell you is that it's a four-stroke, and it's spectacular.  There is a little more info on my blog, and a photoshopped teaser pic. Full details will come toward the end of next month, when the gag order expires."
