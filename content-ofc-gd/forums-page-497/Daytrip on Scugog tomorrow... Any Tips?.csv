Probably launch from gorski's (suggestion from fine OFC member) and probably will target bass but if a muskie wants to visit...   Anyways, any tips would be appreciated and hopefully the storms haven't scared the fish!  Should I pick some leeches or worms up for the harnesses or just stick to the standard lures?  Thanks."

Flip a jig/pig,senko, a lot of nice bass call that undercut bank home.  If you plan on fishing in the evening you might want to try drifting through the thick weeds adjacent to Goreskis dunking a chartreuse spinner bait into the pockets, when the eyes are in the mood it can be a lot of fun!!"
