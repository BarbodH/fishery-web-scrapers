Also what is there policy on bringing in coolers? I have not been there in about 12 years and looks like I am taking a few young people there today. thanks"
615782,ccmtcanada,2011-08-26 13:06:00,7971,I was going to say I don't think you are allowed to fish for the whales and dolphins!!!  I got this from their website...so I'm assuming coolers are ok...just take note of the no glass bottles.  Picnicking  You may bring food and beverages into the park. Alcoholic beverages and glass bottles are not permitted. Picnic areas with tables are located as you drive into the parking lot and at the Family Picnic Area within the park's grounds. Check the park map when you arrive.    As far as cheaper tickets...I cant help you with that.  Good luck and have fun!
615783,bigbuck,2011-08-26 13:10:00,2449,"As for discounted passes, pop into a local hotel/motel/no tell and grab a few of the tourism rags and see in there. As for coolers, you are fine as long as it isn't full of beer. Pop, water, food and snacks are perfectly fine to bring in. Its a family oriented park. You may want to pick up a box of Corn Pops to feed the grizzlies. That's what they sell there. The kids will love it. My wife takes the girls 2-3 times a summer, she pays the extra 5 bucks for the season pass and gets her money's worth out of it."
615784,ketchenany,2011-08-26 13:12:00,3229,Stop in at the Ontario Travel Information Centre at 5355 Stanly Ave in Niagara Falls they should have something.  See if they have magazine called Attraction Ontario it will have some.  You can check on line at ontariotravel.net/family  My book shows $41.95 for adults and 34.95 for kids + taxes.  Hope this helps
616185,Uncle Buck,2011-08-27 12:57:00,1000,"probably late but...  coolers are not a problem... tons of people bring them and they have picnic areas/picnic tables all around keeps your cost down...  don't know of any discounts, but for an extra $5 you get a season pass which is good for the whole season..."
616226,fishing n autograph,2011-08-27 15:32:00,2540,"I'd advise not to go, I wasn't impressed the last timee I went.. The animals looked lathargic sick and mangy...and it was over priced, but that's just my opinion"
616253,bow slayer,2011-08-27 19:38:00,1074,"thanks for the replies.....definately overpriced( 86 bucks for me and 1 kid) but my 10 year old loved it. No coupons are available according to the info centre they stopped them about 3 years ago. Taking a coooler was no problems thank god it had on handle and wheels,kept our drinks and subs cold plus doubled as a seat when waiting for him on some of the rides. We fed 2 bags of marshmallows to the bears.Good times."
616257,ketchenany,2011-08-27 19:50:00,3229,  X2 and more!
616259,misfish,2011-08-27 19:58:00,29133,"  Then something should be said. If you feel this way,say something.Not here,but  through the proper channels."
616276,Pigeontroller,2011-08-27 21:30:00,2793,"Maybe the bears look sick cause the visitors are allowed to feed them marshmallows?  Plenty of Zoo's and other animal attractions give back by rehabilitating animals, and participating in other willife projects...John Holer(owner) is a circus side show entertainer at best...Those animals are there to turn a buck and if they don't look heathly its probably cause they aren't well cared for...  On another note, a year ago the residents of a Trailer park that Holer owns were evicted, one old lady killed herself cause she had no where to go...I was at a Window manufacturer next door last week...Trailer park is all overgrown, windows boarded up...No sign of any new construction...I guess that old lady coulda stayed put for awhile...I'd rather eat a dollar bill than give it to that ass."
616278,Uncle Buck,2011-08-27 21:54:00,1000,"this is the way i saw it...  from a financial point of view...  Driving Time(from my place): Marineland 30min drive    Wonderland 1hr drive (without traffic - not likely)  Edge: Marineland  Parking costs: MArineland free, Wonderland $10 (i think, haven't been in a few years) or $35 for a season parking pass  Edge: Marineland  Ticket Costs:  Marineland $47 (season pass)  Wonderland $86 (season pass)  Edge: Marineland  Food Cost: Marineland - Bring your own and eat in park    Wonderland - Get ripped off, or walk back to your car for food/drinks  Edge: Marineland  Funfactor:  Marineland - not bad    Wonderland - Awesome  Edge: Wonderland  For me atleast Marineland is an obvious choice... Wife doesn't like rides anyways, and i'm not much for shows... but don't mind watching the animals... plus hit the casino on the way home also....  I'll go with Marineland over wonderland..."
