614527,capt bruce,2011-08-22 21:13:00,820,"If you cant get the boat in reverse , at least take it out of gear , strong salmon going south boat in gear going north = ouch . I allways have at least 250 -500 yds line on my reels but when I have a big hit I allways take the boat out of gear untill we see which way the fish is going and than I try to turn the boat to chach up . I run 8 lines + most days so doing this will mess up other lines but if its a biggun we can allways untangle .Most so called long runs is the boat in gear going one way fish goig in the other direction . at least taking the boat out of gear will lesson the run getting the boat into reverse will save the fish ."
614528,misfish,2011-08-22 21:16:00,29133, Bruce knows what he talking about.
614543,Gregoire,2011-08-22 22:11:00,1397,"Thanks for the advice. We are heading out tomorrow night. Knowing the way things go the re-spooled reels and new knowledge will result in nothing but shakers, if anything at all."
614550,Pikeslayer,2011-08-22 22:29:00,1443," Hi Greg, Are you using a snubber between your dipsey and leader/fly? This is a must when running with braid or wire and should reduce the amount of bent hooks. Also you might find this YouTube video (not a fan of the sound track BTW) of interest. It does show the appropriate amount of drag you want on the initial strike. Notice how the rod is 'thumping' and peeling line in short bursts vs peeling line continuously. http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y40/nflboy07/?action=view&current=bigdproductions.mp4 (courtesy of 'Big D'). I'm not sure how to explain this, but when we are fighting the fish, we make them 'work' for every foot of line but never try to 'brake' the fish. Does this make sense?  Simon"
614564,Gregoire,2011-08-22 22:57:00,1397," Thanks for the video link. We are running snubbers. In order to take the tension off of the drag of the reel we are attaching downrigger clips to the line and leaving the drag a a very low setting. This was allowing us to have the drag set low so that it was easier to take the rod out of the holder, and preventing the clicking, or losing line when  cornering, or speeding up. However I think that the tension on the spool was set gat too light. Tomorrow night when we go out I'm going to be increasing the drag on our dipsy rigs. Obviously we haven't quite figured out the correct setting between too tight and too loose. As far as making the fish work for every foot, I like to set the drag pretty light and thumb the spool. I know I have to increase the drag a bit if the fish is peeling so much line that it is burning my thumb. I know this may sound like an overly cautions approach, but I think it increases the likelyhood of landing a big fish if we are lucky enough to hook into one."
614565,misfish,2011-08-22 22:57:00,29133,"Have a question about spin doc,s, and this may explain why Paul was not happy with his Flie fliker line (I was surprised aswell). We let the newly spooled reels out with a wieght,then rereeled it in to get rid of the twist. We ran spin docs with flys and spoons. When we reeled a fish,the line was all twisted/spireled,and there were flies on the line. We were using high quailty snap swivels."
614567,Gregoire,2011-08-22 23:01:00,1397, How are you attaching your flies and spoons to your spin doctors? And are you talking about spiny fleas on your line?
614586,Pikeslayer,2011-08-22 23:53:00,1443,"Greg, Your idea of increasing the drag is going in the right direction, but don't over tighten. When your dipsey is running at your desired length, test your drag setting by pulling your line in front of the reel. Try to 'feel'  for 10-20 lb resistance and set your drag accordingly. Also notice in that video, that before they pull the rod out of the holder, they are thumbing/releasing/adjusting the drag before they pull the rod and then adjust the drag after. bTW, I use Scotty Orcas (quick release) for my dipsey lines. I'm not familiar with the downrigger clips to line method, but I'm pretty confident that if you can get the right drag tension in the holders, you can eliminate that process. Remember, you want thump, zip, thump, zip zip, thump zip zip zip. Not ziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing for 100's of feet (I know that sound is sexy) If you have fighter on, you might typically adjust your drag +/- a number of times throughout the fight. Hope I'm being helpful."
614591,Pikeslayer,2011-08-23 00:11:00,1443," Brian, When releasing dipseys + leader +  spin doctors + flies, you have to let them 'creep' out. A very slow release. I don't let them out by free spooling, set the drag so the resistance of the water against the dipsey pulls the line of the reel. Typically, a 150 ft release might take 3-5 minutes depending on your boat speed of 2.5 - 2.75? If you release too fast, everything is free falling and twist is inevitable. If running SD without dipsey, you need to have a 4-6 ft. leader between main line & SD. For what it's worth, I use only SPRO swivels on all LO set ups."
614594,Gregoire,2011-08-23 00:17:00,1397, Some really good advice there. I will definitely look into using the methods you recommend. Thanks
614635,myot,2011-08-23 03:52:00,131," 2x strong is about as heavy a hook as you can go without changing the action of the lure  Salmon are all about angles when fighting them an experenced salmon angler can keep most salmon under control by changeing angles on them either with the boat or when in close quarters with the rod  I have landed 1000's of kings in my life and close to 400 this year alone ""over 40 days logged this year"" and never had a fish spool me thats even with a 500' section of copper and 450' of 50lbs braid backing its all about pressure knowing your breaking point and angles  Dan"
614642,BillM,2011-08-23 05:31:00,17367," You didn't turn that fish, you held on until it was done"
614700,Fish Farmer,2011-08-23 12:59:00,2234,"X2 Maybe I'm confused, you say you set the drag light and your rigger clip broke off into the water. Something is wrong there. Another thought you may have foul hooked the Salmon which happens time to time. Tail hook ups can happen. 20LB test mono is lots for Salmon but you start adding the other crap like divers and flashers they all work against you and the fish. You have a lot of connections and knots which sometime foul into each other if the fish turns and spins. Allot of brake offs happen some time running sliders. Running divers you should be running braid or wire (no stretch) to release the diver. Most times the diver won't release with mono if your setting is set to tight. If you have a big King on slow down, make a turn but don't forget, he can come back at you just as fast. Just a thought I caught about 15 bows the other day and 2 were caught in the gut and I was just using the riggers with SMALL spoons. Foul can happen. I troll 3.5 to 4.0."
614703,Gregoire,2011-08-23 13:09:00,1397," It definitely was a tough lesson to learn. We've been a bit to casual up to this point in terms of setting the drag and using the boa to help us fight the fish. Definitely will by trying some new things on the water. I know that we did a few things wrong with the fish, but I'm not sure if we would have tightened the drag up earlier he wouldn't have straightened the hook or simply ripped it out. It is two days later and I'm still in awe of the pure power of the fish. Even if we would have done everything fight we would have been lucky to bring him in, if he was the monster that I like to think he was. Here are the changes I am planning on making: 900 feet of line Increase the tension on the drag while in he rod holders Adjust the drag before taking the rod out of the holder if it is a screamer Put the boat into neutral Start a slow turn to 90 degrees towards the fish if it feels big  Is there anything else you guys would suggests. We are heading out tonight.  Just wondering Dan, if you keep your drag pretty tight, and also what pound test you use on your dypsy setup for your leaders, and what types of knots you use on the hooks, as we have had some problems there as well.  Oh yeah, if you keep your drag tight do you find that you get hooks straightened, or torn out?"
614712,Harrison,2011-08-23 13:53:00,2202," Greg, go fish'n buddy.  You've got the basics down. Don't over think it, you'll dail it in and figure out the angles and pressure to use through experience.  Now go dredge bottom and hook up a derby winner. Good Luck"
614720,Gregoire,2011-08-23 14:03:00,1397, Thanks dude. Hopefully we'll hook into something decent. Ill try to take a pick or two.
614848,dave524,2011-08-23 19:41:00,4508,"Saw this video on youtube, perfect drag setting for trolling with a dipsey, not too light or heavy. I find that sweet spot is where you occasionally get a bit of creep at times, if your not getting a bit of creep you're probably too tight. Those Down East holders are the ticket too for the problem of getting yor rod out of the holder  <iframe width=""560"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv5QUg3rS3k"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
614857,kickingfrog,2011-08-23 20:03:00,8333,"Not sure if this has been brought up, but is the drag working properly? Even the best reel can be made to feel cheap if the drag is worn or not working."
614962,Gregoire,2011-08-24 02:36:00,1397,"The reels are new this year, and the drag pulls pretty even and steady, so I think they are working properly. Got out tonight. Nothing but shakers except for a teenager on the leadcore, which we hardly ever use. It was lucky that we used it tonight. Numbers were good though, as we released at least 15 fish. We just didn't get the screamer like we were hoping for. Thanks for all the tips as I have learned a lot from this thread."
615420,castgame,2011-08-25 14:46:00,161,"here's a thought: with 200+' of line out, 20lb mono might be a stronger system than 80lb braid, due to the stretch/dynamic nature of the mono. that stretch absorbs a lot of energy that is otherwise transferred straight to the knot or wherever the weakest point may be. not that i've caught thousands of kings or even many over 25lbs, but i've never broken one off even using as low as 12lb test! of course, the dynamic nature of mono also makes setting the hook more difficult so you probably lose some fish before the fight starts, but i wouldn't be surprised if you landed more, as others are saying, with stronger hooks/swivels and good monofilament."
615895,myot,2011-08-26 17:40:00,131," for divers we run 4 differnt setups Early spring or after a lake turn over 30lbs mono for targeting fish 20' down ""lots of strech not my favorate"" 50lbs braid ""love this set up but fleas can be an isue"" 30lbs 7 strand wire made by AFW great all around 20lbs 7 strand wire made by AFW fantastic for fishing deep but not kind to amatures  as for leaders we run 20lbs floro for spoons 30lbs floro for atractors never a snuber we just use rods that are not as stiff as a traditional diver rod never a roller rod just a high quality rigger rod with a twilly tip  any other questions just shot me a PM I will do my best to answer them  Dan Knockout Lures Prostaff"
614449,Gregoire,2011-08-22 18:14:00,1397,"I posted this topic on another board today, but am looking for a few more opinions. Last night while salmon fishing we had a huge hit on the dipsy set back 200 feet. We set the drag really light and stop the line from coming off the spool while trolling by attaching the line to a rigger clip. This allows the fish to pull drag, and decreases the amount of pressure put on the components, as we have had several hooks straightened this year, and a few break offs. Anyway the reel was screaming just after the hit. As I grabbed the rod the rigger clip broke off and fell into the water. I tightened the drag a bit and handed it to my buddy. At this point the fight was only 20 seconds or so in, and we were nearly down to the backing, something I only noticed after I had given the rod to my buddy. I pointed out that we were about to be spooled, so he tightened the drag and was immediately broken off. On other boards advice has been to try to turn the boat...but I do not think we had the time, as the fish went on one extremely fast and long run, and did not stop until he broke us off. The reels had 500 feet of line on them, so they are off to get re-spooled with 1000 feet, so that will help. The only other thing I think I could have done was try to stop the run before I handed off the rod, but I thought I had time. In the future I will try to at least slow down the fish before handing the rod off, but seeing as it was not my turn, I did not want to be the one fighting the fish. This was my first true experience seeing the power that great lakes salmon have, and I am totally in awe. We have had the opportunity to fish with a former charter captain with over 30 years experience, and I always try to pick his mind about the size of some of the fish. I remember him telling me that unless you are extremely lucky  or you start fishing with chains, landing a really big salmon (40+ pounds) is a crapshoot. I totally understand what he means now. I honestly do not know what we could have done to stop that fish from running. Anyway any advice you guys have about what we should have done differently is greatly appreciated. We ended up going 2 for 5. Landed a 16 pounder. I took me 40 minuted to land a 22 pounder that took me from 200 feet to 350 at one point. I had a huge head and tail, we thought we were on the board when we first saw it, but it did not have the length. Also had a breakoff on another decent fish that took the meat on the rigger and ran out pretty far before breaking the knot at the hook."
614453,Harrison,2011-08-22 18:23:00,2202,"Your friend is right.  It is a crap shoot with big fish.  Try and turn the boat if you can, gear down the best you can.  There is really not much else to do.  Also, if the bigguns are going to run, they are going to run, there is no slowing them until they choose to.. I am talking the 35+ fish.  Just know you are not alone.  There are many derby winning fish hooked up this time of year that are still swimming."
614454,anders,2011-08-22 18:23:00,1168,"Try setting the drag at the tension you want it before you put it in its holder and loosen the drag if need be while you are fighting the fish.  I never keep my drag loose and then tighten while fighting a fish, to me that is a big NO NO. I would rather loosen than tighten any day.  What lb test are you running?"
614459,mike rousseau,2011-08-22 18:31:00,4661,if this is becoming a common occurance...  up the strength of your tackle!!!  for musky my gear is 100lb test and up...  line is 50lb mono or 100lb braid swivels and snaps are 150-300lb test 4x strong hooks heavy duty split rings... wolverine  the musky i target are about the same weight as your kings... but it is more of a bulldog style fight... not screaming runs...  and carp... they scream line...  i run 50lb braid and big 12 foot rods with a lot of power to turn a fish... the rod lenght really allows you to steer big fish and put em where you want em...  if your not pulling hooks/straightening hooks i would beef up your gear...  if you dont wanna beef up your gear...  start circling around any time you get a big runner... then... if you still think its huge and you wont be able to control it... start clearing your other lines and chase the fish...  my 2 cents
614467,BillM,2011-08-22 18:40:00,17367,You aren't going to turn a big chinnie like you will a muskie..  You brute force these fish and they'll bust off.   More line capacity would be a good idea.  I was out with another forum member last year and we had a fish rip off 500ft of line in no time.
614468,Gregoire,2011-08-22 18:40:00,1397," We run 80# braid on the dipsy rigs. Today my buddy got the reels respooled and he now has 900 feet of line on the reels. As far as keeping the drag tight we have been told by experienced fisherman that big fish will break the line, straighten the hook, or have the hook pulled out of their mouth if the line is too tight, and I have seen a lot of straightened hooks already this year, so we have different opinions about drag setting. I think that with the 900 feet of line we will have a much lesser chance of getting spooled now."
614469,BillM,2011-08-22 18:43:00,17367,"Good idea on the extra line capacity.  Now you can run whatever drag you want.   I wouldn't run big drag on a dipsy with braid anyhow, you're just asking for problems."
614472,Harrison,2011-08-22 18:48:00,2202,There are not many strikes that can compare to a big chinook smoking a dipsy in open water in mid August.
614473,BillM,2011-08-22 18:50:00,17367," The best part is trying to get the rod out of the holder, lol!!!"
614474,Gregoire,2011-08-22 18:54:00,1397," Thanks for the input Mike. I target musky as well, and I can tell you that musky and salmon are quite different. In my experience musky will stand and fight you were they are, or will jump in an attempt to shake the hook. Salmon will peel off line, sometimes hundreds of feet in seconds. The big ones will stay deep, much like a walleye, only 20 or 30 pounds heavier. Salmon also have a very different shape than musky, they can use their mass to sit, and it can be very hard to move, much harder than musky in my experience. They definitely require a lot more finesse than Musky, and there is not the urge to horse them in as there is with Musky in order to release them, in fact you will probably loose even a small salmon if you try to horse it in. Musky are much easier to move in the water than salmon in my opinion.  We already are running pretty beefy gear, 9'6"" talora heavy action rods and 80# braid. We are running a 27 foot boat so circling is much harder, not to mention that you have to pull all your rods (we run 4 or 5) before you can circle, a process that will take a few minutes at least. We were almost spooled last night in under 20 seconds. It's a very different game from musky fishing."
614478,Gregoire,2011-08-22 19:00:00,1397,"  Taking the rod out of the holder was what caused to rigger clip to snap...I just couldn't believe that the tension I put on the fish did not even slow it down a bit. It was like the line was attached to an freight train speeding up in the opposite direction. It was definitely one of the most exciting fish that I never caught. I still love the violence of a musky strike, mostly because I usually have the rod in my hand, but that was a rush that won't soon be topped. Actually I had a huge musky strike on a lure a few weeks ago, where the fish took a chunk out of my lure, but somehow did not attach itself to one of 3 trebbles. Maybe I should start a topic on exciting strikes where you loose the fish LOL"
614480,dave524,2011-08-22 19:02:00,4508,"I would never use a reel with only 500 feet on it out there, I'd drop in pound test to get at least 300 yds on a reel or even more. Given a choice of 500 feet of 25 or 30 lb test or a 1000 of 17 pound I'd feel better tackling a big one with the 17 pound."
614481,Fisherman,2011-08-22 19:08:00,7201,"IMHO, if you're running 80lb line, (don't care if it's braid, mono or dental floss), then there's something wrong with your set up.  I've caught my fair share of brutes over the years and the highest I've ever gone is 20lb XT.  I've only experienced a couple of break offs at the end of the season, usually when their teeth cut the line, a short 6"" leader will fix that.  Only one thing I forgot, it's possible the fish was foul hooked, in the tail or back, then it's almost a sure thing that even a small fish can spool you."
614484,misfish,2011-08-22 19:09:00,29133, I would have to agree with you on that one. Heavier test and more drag means straighened out hook IMO.
614487,mike rousseau,2011-08-22 19:18:00,4661,I fight carp on the st.Lawrence in areas with up to 5 mph current... I catch 30lb fish every year in the current... On shore... And I've seen them peel over 300 feet and a buddy got peeled almost 900 before he turned his 40lb carp...  And we are on shore and can't follow or chase fish...  Our hooks are only little size 2-4...  I'm not putting carp or musky in the same category as salmon.... But using tools from different areas of fishing has helped me become a good multispecies angler...  And don't tell me you can't turn a chinny... I've targeted them from shore also... I've landed chinnys over 30 with 10 lb mono on a 10 foot noodle rod... And before you say they don't have anywhere to run when they are in the rivers... I've landed 30 lb fish off of a pier... They had lots of room to run... And they did... And I turned em... Then reeled in the 400-500 yards of line that was previously on my reel...
614488,mike rousseau,2011-08-22 19:19:00,4661,Curious...  Why dont you guys use stronger hooks?
614496,anders,2011-08-22 19:34:00,1168,i have never had a salmon straighten or break off any line yet (knock on wood)!  I use 20 lbs test and have never had an issue with those occurances.  We leave our drag set and turn down if we need too and never turn it up and we havent had any failure as mentioned.  We will pull up all lines hit neutral if need be and even chase if we have to.
614499,wallacio,2011-08-22 19:41:00,475,There has already been some good advice posted here already - definitely put more line on your reels than 500' and turn the boat if possible.  Another tactic I sometimes employ is to encourage the fish to slow down or stop by thumbing the spool rather than clamping the drag right down.   This allows you to adjust tension without breaking off and often when fish feel strong resistance they'll slow or stop.   With this said (and as another poster already stated)sometimes there's nothing you can do and there are a lot of potential derby wining fish that are still swimming after a battle or two under their belts!!!
614500,Gregoire,2011-08-22 19:45:00,1397,"Just out of interest for you guys saying 80# braid is too strong do you run dipsy's, and if you do, what line do you use on your dypsy's?"
614501,Gregoire,2011-08-22 19:49:00,1397, That is really surprising to me. What rigs you run. Do you run dypsy's? Are you running riggers? Do you use spin doctors? Flasher? How big is the largest fish you've landed. What type of knots  and line do you use. I just want to see if we are doing something wrong.
614502,Gregoire,2011-08-22 19:52:00,1397,"  I have tried thumbing the spool, I actually prefer this method, and was using it last night when I landed the 22 pounder. On the big hit last night I think the braid would have burnt off the skin on my finger if I was thumbing the spool. I find it much easier to do on the rigger set-up as we run mono on those."
614509,anders,2011-08-22 20:07:00,1168," fish solely with riggers, never dipsy's...running depths down to 100' sometimes more.  Run mainly 11 inch flashers, abe n al, and dodgers, with the occasional spin doctors.  I use trilene xt 20lb test with the trilene knot (which is pretty much the only knot i use), and the biggest i've landed has been 26lbs.  I have lost lots of fish as well, just never had a break off or straight hooks.  You may not be doing anything wrong just plain ol lady luck against us sometimes that's all."
614512,Gregoire,2011-08-22 20:20:00,1397,We run 20 and 30 pound mono on the riggers. We had a break off yesterday on the riggers on the teaser head right at the hook.
614522,dwc67,2011-08-22 20:59:00,140,it's been a great year again for size  i had a 500 copper with 700ft of backing get spooled even though we were turning the boat to try and catch it. i tell myself it was 30 plus even though i had spunky 25 take me out 900+ the day before
614526,Harrison,2011-08-22 21:11:00,2202, I'd say 35+
