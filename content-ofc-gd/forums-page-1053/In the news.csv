184434,Roy,2008-04-09 17:01:00,13728,Are blinds and curtains optional Gerritt? Do they get dressed and shower in the basement? Maybe your window folks installed the one-ways backwards?

184443,keram,2008-04-09 17:24:00,585,I've thought that the aquarium in BPS was the big one
184839,blaque,2008-04-10 13:32:00,2419,"Just georgeous!! Have a bachelors in Architecture and can really appreciate the design of each and every space in the design........a true show piece, but with most contemporary designs, ya dont get that comfy cozy homey feeling from it. Which is fine........its like a show car that you just dont drive. Great for a snobby corporate cocktail party though lol. Seriously though, that is an absolutely georgeous structure!!!!!!!!  And something to be gushingly proud of Gerritt."
184842,pikehunter,2008-04-10 13:37:00,1659,Nice!  I would have loved to have been the window rep on that project.
184874,KyleM,2008-04-10 14:37:00,218,"G, who does your cabinet work?"
184878,Gerritt,2008-04-10 14:44:00,6129,  We have our own in house cabinet makers  Thank you guys for the compliments on this project  G
184881,tinbanger,2008-04-10 14:57:00,1028,"Nice work  The details are very slick , excellent craftsman ship as there is no way to hide things with trim etc .   tb"

184894,Wendel,2008-04-10 15:44:00,213,"Spectacular, but not a place I would call home... Maybe just Winter Home lol I really like all the glass though, it's beautiful. I like the concept of the room hanging out over the ravine... that would be an amazing view"
184950,Ron,2008-04-10 17:55:00,1683,Nice work Gerrit!  A company you can be proud to work for for sure.

184970,Tinman,2008-04-10 18:58:00,376,That place is incredible! The hvac stuff must have been a nightmare to do lol
184976,kennyman,2008-04-10 19:14:00,737,"WOW! That is very cool. Especially good for those who are voyeuristically minded. Not my thing, but a piece of modern art for sure."

185128,2 tone z71,2008-04-10 23:54:00,1311,Nice work Gerritt what was your specialty in the build
185136,Gerritt,2008-04-11 00:04:00,6129,"My official title is Manager  But I do get my hands dirty as well. I am a finish carpenter by trade, with cabinet making as a minor LOL... But have been involved in most aspects of building for most of my life...(I grew up in a contracting family) And was self employed for a good while...  I was always told to work smart and not hard and went to school... I turned into a grunt anyways LOL  I cannot do as much as I would like to anymore due to a shattered wrist and subsequent surgery... but I am still building  It was a great transition for me... from someone that was in the field and knows the trades.. To someone that is now in an office directing the trades..  Like I said though.. I do like to get my hands dirty though as well  But my role in this project was construction management  Thanks for asking!  G"
