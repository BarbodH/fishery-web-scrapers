185242,Bernie,2008-04-11 02:28:00,3190,"Sorry I didn't get back to you jat. Was hooking up a wireless router for my brother. Anyway, is it usually a single clunk when you apply the brake or does it continue? Usually a C/V joint will click/clack when you turn and accelerate from a stop. If you have a brake caliper loose, broken caliper pin or loose brake pad it can cause a clunking noise. Does your brake pedal pulsate on application? Loose front end suspension parts can also be an issue here. As far as your oil leak goes they can be tricky to locate if the engine is old and dirty. sometimes a small leak from above your oil pan can seep down and run around the top part of your oil pan. Look for a leaking valve cover gasket or maybe a bad oil pressure switch. Ok, thats a start. Any more info you can give me will be a help."
