They had three colors, black, brown, and white ones. I believe they were 11"" long. The guys would cast them to shore then reel back while tugging a little and it looked just like a snake swimming across the lake.  Please respond if you know what I am talking about.  Thanks, Curt"

184784,nancur373,2008-04-10 06:12:00,1211,Exactly the ones. Thanks. Think they would work for pike or walleye?
185102,forrest,2008-04-10 23:12:00,1032,I don't know what type of fish they work on. They work OK in hooking fishermen.  I can't remember a time I saw a fish go after a snake.  Maybe snakes are common prey down south(?)  Whats wrong with a good old Rapala or white twisty tail jig?  forrest
