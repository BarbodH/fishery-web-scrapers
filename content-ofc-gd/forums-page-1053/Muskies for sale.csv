185143,forrest,2008-04-11 00:12:00,1032,"Is that $15 for a 2-3"" muskie?!"
185144,irishfield,2008-04-11 00:14:00,26272,Dang and I was hoping you were selling the ones in your freezer !  Will they UPS to a Buffalo PO Box? Wonder how they'd take in Lake T ?
185196,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 01:02:00,6623,"I believe so forrest, it`s not easy to to get them, or raise them successfully. Even stocking a pond with bass, bluegill, and catfish can get expensive. One of the reasons it is hard to get permission to fish private ponds and lakes. Numbers of fish in them are limited and they can see too muck pressure.  Worse for top of the food chain fish like ski`s.  Used to be a hatchery on South Bass Island, I believe Salmon at one point, interesting to see."
185314,Marc Thorpe,2008-04-11 09:24:00,621,"Ya but the price remains as the size increases to 10-14  along with volume Many fish from this hatchery have established flourishing fisheries  Wayne,no I am saving those for our Filet O muskie BBQ in Honor the Spawn of ED  Reel my Friend Reel"
185353,Whopper,2008-04-11 12:00:00,2174,"Yep musky's to go, State of Ohio is a big buyer. A few local lakes here get the 12""-14"" Bass & crappie fisherman hate them, the rest of us stand in line to cast for them."
185356,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 12:11:00,6623,"LOL Phil, I don`t hate them! picture a muskie as a cigar smoker, nothing like a fine cigar(small walleye) seen them chasing eyes on a few lakes."
185369,Whopper,2008-04-11 12:40:00,2174, Sad part about it Paul the bass guys probably catch more of them by accident  than the guys that fish for them. Pressure here is unbelievable.
185378,OhioFisherman,2008-04-11 12:54:00,6623,"Phil, hook might be a better term, at least for me. Hooked and lost more than I care to think about and most bass fishing. My buddies have a lot better luck landing them, even in the bass tournaments on lakes that have them.  Just my observations 3/8 ounce spinnerbait with a frog trailer? No Muskie, few bass, downsize to a 1/8 ounce spinnerbait Muskie hit it and no bass.  Jig and pig? lots of bass and some darned muskie!  The lighter the line the more of a chance for muskie.  They prefer spinning tackle and 10 pound tests over a casting reel and 20 pound test.  They may like docks, boat houses, pontoon boats moored, wood in the water, lily pads much more than bass, maybe they just like to eat bass?"
185404,mikeh,2008-04-11 13:44:00,824,Is it legal to buy them and import them into Canada and put them in a lake that already has an existing musky population?  also I can't believe the price of perch and crappie.
185437,irishfield,2008-04-11 15:00:00,26272, Not unless you've secured the proper permits from the MNR.. done the studies.. etc
185443,Billy Bob,2008-04-11 15:13:00,5865,We have a very successful Muskie hatchery here in NY on the shores of Chautaugua Lake. It has been in operation for as long as I can remember (over 30 years). Here's some info on it.  http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7742.html  http://www.wewanchu.com/cgi-bin/fishing/reports.cgi
