185293,4thgen,2008-04-11 04:57:00,157,"Quoted from the article:  ""Mr. Bickford said the species is the first frog known to science without lungs and joins a short list of amphibians with this unusual trait, including a few species of salamanders and a wormlike creature known as a caecilian.""  Unless by ""a few species"" of salamanders, he means about half (more than 250sp.) he is wrong.  Sorry, just getting ready to write a herpetology final..."
