184957,Fang,2008-04-10 18:16:00,1330,Might have better luck trying to get info on back lakes. We used to get the stocking reports for that region from the MNR office but that was a few years ago.
184987,Mike01,2008-04-10 19:36:00,378,Did you just call the regional office for them?
185017,Fang,2008-04-10 20:23:00,1330,Actually dropped in to the old temagami office and when they closed it a number of years ago picked up a copy at Gravenhurst.
185022,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-04-10 20:33:00,39,I have property just outside of North Bay and didn't think any of the lakes didn't have them.Every lake I have fished up there has them but any local tackle shop will tell you.Anywhere around south river and powassan will have lots of trout.good luck
185034,Mike01,2008-04-10 20:59:00,378,Has anyone heard of them being in Ducheney Creek?
