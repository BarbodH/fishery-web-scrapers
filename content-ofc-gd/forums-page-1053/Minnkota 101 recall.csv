184974,Billy Bob,2008-04-10 19:10:00,5865,"I just installed a NEW Minn Kota Edge 40 lb thrust bow mount with a 50"" shaft. First time out the motor was running backwards. I double checked my connections and they were correct (how hard is that). So when I got home I called Minn Kota and of course they said my connections must be reversed. But I convinced the rep lady on the phone that indeed my connections were correct. So she had me trace the foot control connections with her schematic and we found Minn Kota had THREE wire wrong. I am surprised it ran at all. When I rerouted and made the right connections the motor ran counter clock wise like it was designed to and ran about 5 times faster than they way they had it hooked up. Go Figure.  Bob"
