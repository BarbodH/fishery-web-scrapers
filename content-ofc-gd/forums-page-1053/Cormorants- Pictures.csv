184872,KyleM,2008-04-10 14:32:00,218,We have flocks of about 150 swimming around our bay all summer.  I try and ruffle some feathers with the boat doing 55mph but somehow they always manage to steer clear of the crosshairs I have mounted on the bow LOL

Politicians have long used the ratio that one letter from a constituent represents the views of 10,000 constituents. This is why we need to keep the letter writing/e-mail pressure up on her.  Can you imagine what she'd think if just 50% ( 40,000 ) OFAH members all e-mailed her on this subject."
