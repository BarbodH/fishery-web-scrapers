185636,mbac31,2008-04-11 20:53:00,904,"I'm not trying o start anything here, but we get what we deserve. We are willing to pay whatever they ask us to pay for gas. We can all complain about it but that will get us knowhere. I'm not posting this to be rude to anyone, just my opinion. Unless a large group could get together to boycott the gas companies we should snop complaining and get on with it. People should boycott different gas companies each week and see where it gets us. If people dont want to do something about it then do what I do, pay the price and just go fishing. Nothing we can do about it unless we are willing to take action.  Thats my 2 cents worth"
