Brain fart i guess?   I have the boat stored up north and i wanted to grab the oil this weekend and go up and get'er done.    I could ask the guy at the parts counter but i dont wanna look like an  lol    Thanks in advance"
185155,irishfield,2008-04-11 00:24:00,26272,I can't imagine it's more than the litre bottle for the bottom end. I just did my 9.9 = 380ml and my 275 = 800 ml.  Engine itself.. 9.9 = 800ml and my 275 takes 7 litres of expensive stuff...can't imagine the 25 being more than 2 or 3 litres. Will see what I can find.  Good guess... 2 litres  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qi...19204054AAFaZNo
