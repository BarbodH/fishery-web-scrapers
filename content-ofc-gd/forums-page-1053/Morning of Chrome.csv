By 640 I had my first fish in my hands.  The bite was on and off until 1130 when I had to leave.  Overall landed about 10 fish between 3 of us.  No bigguns, lots of little shakers around. I know I'm gonna catch crap from someone about not blurring my backgrounds.  The way I see it, if you recognize it, then you already know it, therefore, who cares.        "

185040,fishinggeek,2008-04-10 21:12:00,325," I was gasping at the monitor when I read that!    I noticed one of Steve's previous post had the same string and was cleaned up, at least I assumed it was cleaned up because it changed without having an edit footnote."

185060,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-10 21:57:00,826,"Some nice fish guys, Don't take any S!@t for the pics Steve!!!  RF"
185146,PickerelHunter,2008-04-11 00:18:00,100,"Nice fish, good stuff.  I have the same philosophy as you with the pics, if you can pick out a random tree in the background you already know the spot, nothing new there...noones going to realize a spot from those types of shots."
185158,Minnow,2008-04-11 00:25:00,177,Nice chrome!
185215,gone_fishin,2008-04-11 01:31:00,481,"Atta boy Steve, nice fish there bud!"
185282,Bly,2008-04-11 03:52:00,1556,Nice fish Steve...glad to see you posted them!!
185303,jonnybass,2008-04-11 07:33:00,346," I agree! If anything, show more!"
185339,ccmtcanada,2008-04-11 11:40:00,7971,"Glad to see you posted this report and pics Steve!  Yep...I figure the same thing....if anyone can recognize a spot from a foot of shoreline and a few trees and grass then by all means go fishing there.  The conditions of the tribs change by the hour...just because you see fish in those picds doesn't mean they'll be there a few hours from then.  Anyhow, great stuff Steve!"
185344,tinbanger,2008-04-11 11:50:00,1028,Nice job Steve  Glad to see someone out fishing  TB
185462,steverowbotham,2008-04-11 15:46:00,1800,"Thanks guys the fish were moving up, broke off two CHROME fish because the only leaderline I had left was 3.4 lbs and there was lots of timber around.  With this blowout we're about to get, these fish will shoot right up.  I think thats my last time out before opener.  It's okay, I'll enjoy some saltwater fishing in Dominican next week."
