184324,yukiginger,2008-04-09 10:37:00,2,"A friend of mine plans to buy a Tracker Targa 185 for trolling and still fishing in the Finger Lakes region of NY state, mostly trolling. Estimated package weight per manufacturer's site is 3,000 lbs. A Merc 115 Optimax and 115 EXLPT EFI Four Sroke are the same price. They have trolled before with another boat employing bags and buckets to get the speed down. Will they be able to troll down with either of these? Is one a better choice for fuel economy (a 7 mile run to the deep waters where they troll and then some hours trolling). Which one would you choose?  Thanks for any advice.  MarkG"

184370,irishfield,2008-04-09 13:51:00,26272,Slowest I could troll my 115 2 stroke Johnson on a 17' Glass boat was 2.3 MPH.. dragging two 5 gallon pails..2 downriggers down and 4 lines out.  ..oh and I'd go the 4 stroke route.

184889,moose72,2008-04-10 15:28:00,28,I would go for the 4 stroke. I had the problems trolling slow enough with a 125 Merc on a 18' aluminum so I use a kicker motor and save fuel and engine life on the expensive motor.
184933,Billy Bob,2008-04-10 17:12:00,5865,"My partner's boat is a 18.5' Lund and he has 115 4 Stroke Yamaha outboard. PLENTY of power and it trolls down to 1.7 mph without towing any buckets or wind socks. Get a FOUR STROKER, I know I will someday when I need another boat and motor.  Just my honest opinion but I wouldn't get a Mercury motor. Had two and never again.  Good Luck, Bob"
184954,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-10 18:03:00,4399,If he`s doing a lot of trolling I would go with a kicker. Better on gas and less wear and tear on the main motor.
