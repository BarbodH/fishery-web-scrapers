185135,danbouck,2008-04-11 00:03:00,4380,I want to get a cheap downrigger for my new boat and maybe throw it on the tinny. I'm only going to be using it a couple times a year.  What do you think my best bet is? I saw this at BPS and thought it might work. What do you think? http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults  I'd like to spend no more than $100
185140,silveradosheriff,2008-04-11 00:08:00,1025,"Hi Dan, I have one that I don't use (since I bought the electrics), if you want to try one out."
185141,forrest,2008-04-11 00:08:00,1032,"Dan are you fishing for a ""torpedo diver"" response?"
185142,johnnyb,2008-04-11 00:10:00,3413,"I've got the same one as you've linked, Dan, and I really like it.  Can't say that I've used it as much as I thought I would, but so far, so good.  Before I got it, I got a Pink Lady, which I found worked really well  (heeeere torpedo diverrrrrrr...)"
185145,danbouck,2008-04-11 00:17:00,4380, Let's stick with the downriggers
185149,danbouck,2008-04-11 00:21:00,4380, I might take you up on that. Is it the same as what I linked?
185208,silveradosheriff,2008-04-11 01:19:00,1025,Pretty sure - I'd have to get off my lazy butt and go check to be 100%.  :-)
185212,Greencoachdog,2008-04-11 01:23:00,8163,I have a Cannon mini troll as well and they work great!!!
185643,fishdawg,2008-04-11 21:08:00,912,Dan - what waters will you be fishing & what are the target species?
