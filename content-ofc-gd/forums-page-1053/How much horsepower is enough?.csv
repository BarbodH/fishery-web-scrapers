It gets me where I want to go at 35 to 37 mph, and it trolls down to next to nothing. I do a lot of trolling. For my situation, I wouldn't want anything bigger than I have right now."

184870,charlesn,2008-04-10 14:26:00,551,"While maxing out the boat is conventional wisdom and some good points raised here.  For a 14' tinnie with a 25 or 30.  To be honest, different makes and models of those 25s or 30s could mean that some 25s are actually better than some 30s.  I'd go for a 4-stroke 30 if I could afford it.  I'd guess it would be fine from idle, to trolling to your top end which would be about 30-35 mph depending on the boat's hull design, weight, how much stuff you load it down with, # of passengers etc..  Things like trim tabs, hydrofoils, jack plates, stainless steel props, etc. that can affect performance (not just speed) are pretty irrelevant at those HPs...  Find the best deal is my advice.  If you buy a 25 and get to a point where you think, man, I wish I could go faster, you're gonna need to upgrade the whole rig to get a noticeable difference.  That's based on my personal experience anyways from starting with a 16' tinny with a 40, to putting a 60 on there, to a 17 tinny with a 90, then 17' glass with a 115 and now a 20' glass with a 225, but wishing I could strap 300+ ponies back there.  lol  Charles"

184900,boatman,2008-04-10 16:13:00,350,My heavy 14.5' boat with 30 hp goes 26 mph WOT. 5 hp isn't going to make a big difference in these motors. Prop pitch will.

185087,musky66,2008-04-10 22:47:00,273,I bought my used Starcraft with a 4 stroke 50 hp on it- it was rated for a 125 max+ big mistake! 5o was fine with 2 adults in calm water- but if I was fighting the wind- I would be pushed backwards! Cost me a small fortune to upgrade to a Yamy 115 fuelie but what a difference! I knew better but let the dealer and my finances talk me into the purchase. I had a wide 14' tinny with the max 25 hp 2 stroke on it and it would tube an adult with 2 adults in the boat as well!
