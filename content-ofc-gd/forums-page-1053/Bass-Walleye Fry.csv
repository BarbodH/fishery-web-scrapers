185540,Stoty,2008-04-11 17:43:00,2910,Are there any hatcheries around the GTA that sell Bass/Walleye fry to raise in an aquarium?  Is that even legal?? I would love to raise a few buckets or eyes in my house.  *Stoty
185550,Zubris21,2008-04-11 18:00:00,563,I'm pretty sure its illegal to raise game species in an aquarium.  I have however seen some videos on youtube and such of largies being raised.  I also think having an aquarium with some nice shiny perch and sunfish would be pretty cool too.

185572,setomonkey,2008-04-11 18:37:00,872,"I think this has come up before...  The way I remember it is that it is legal to have sport fish in your aquarium at home, but they count towards your possession limit. So that limits the number of a species you can have, depending on which license you have, and it limits what you can keep when out on the water, should you choose to keep fish for a meal.  Mike"
185578,irishfield,2008-04-11 18:47:00,26272,Yes they count towards someones possession... but the big question is... how did you get them there in the first place since it's illegal to transport live game fish in Ontario.
185590,Bitsmith2k,2008-04-11 19:08:00,396,wonder if you could buy an artificially fertilized egg...  could you transport it? would it count against your limit before it hatched?
