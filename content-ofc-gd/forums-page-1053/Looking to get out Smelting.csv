But I sure enjoyed it...and nothing beats fresh smelts in the frying pan. Anyway I'm looking to give it a go again but have no idea where to begin. I am in Oshawa and am willing to drive 2-3 hours to chase the tasty little buggers down. Can anybody take me under there wing and let me tag along some night when they are heading out? Willing to split gas, do the driving,whatever. All I'm asking is for the opportunity to give it a good go with a chance for a frying pan of smelt. My job affords me lots of days to get out so I'm not limited to weekends only.  PM if you wish, and thanx to anyone who is willing to help out."
