184606,forrest,2008-04-09 23:28:00,1032,I am planning on buying a drift sock for my 16' tin.  How big do I get them.  If I get 2 to I downsize or do I keep it the same size as if I would buy one?   forrest
184613,Fang,2008-04-09 23:34:00,1330,Most now all have the boat size rating on them  If you buy 2 don't down size I run one off the back and then off the nose so you get a wide open side drift and socks don't get in the way of landing fish.  It's nice to have 2 out in real heavy winds
184630,muskymike,2008-04-09 23:56:00,772,"Forrest, buy a size or 2 bigger then stated on the package. just on the 14' the small one didnt do anything. i bought a 54"" and its great. i use it for both the big and small boat."
184638,mikeh,2008-04-10 00:08:00,824,one recommendation I will make is to not buy the harness as you can make your own with some foam to keep the rope on top of the water.
184639,2 tone z71,2008-04-10 00:08:00,1311,My boss bought me a big one as a gift Ive yet to try it but it should work well
184647,Wendel,2008-04-10 00:23:00,213,"If you're a cheapass like me, then you may want to consider shopping bags from either ikea or sobeys... They work awesome... and cost like 2 bucks each lol"
184650,bpsbassman,2008-04-10 00:27:00,941, What Mike said.  I remember guys usng the ikea bags with good success.
184653,Roy,2008-04-10 00:36:00,13728,On the river here I can get 5mph more with a sock.
184665,forrest,2008-04-10 01:01:00,1032,OK...thanks guys.  I will buy 2 and buy big.  I have heard guys say thing use ikea bags for their canoes.  I have never used one but I expect the Ikea bag is pretty close.  forrest
184669,muskymike,2008-04-10 01:03:00,772,I am gonna go gets me some Ikea bags hahaha to add to it.
184763,irishfield,2008-04-10 03:37:00,26272,Trombly's sale this weekend.. Lindy socks are 1/2 price in 3 sizes.
185096,forrest,2008-04-10 23:02:00,1032," Dang!  Orillia is a bit of a drive though and at this time of year its hard to convince the wife that we are going on a family outing and ""accidentally"" come across the sale  I did get a couple of Lindy Original fishing socks...50"" with a bouy harness @$45!  Could I tell the diff between drift socks at this point, not likely (I hear the more expensive ones can be smaller and to the same job).  forrest"
185104,irishfield,2008-04-10 23:14:00,26272,I hear Gagnon's also has a sale on with socks!
185108,forrest,2008-04-10 23:24:00,1032,"  Yep,  thats where I got mine!  Bass Pro sells the Lindy Drift control Original 50"" for $63 without a bouy harness.  Gagnon's is selling them with a bouy harness (bouy not in stock yet) for $45!  I did not see anymore when I went back this afternoon, its a 4 day sale so I would think they would put more out later.  Lots of 60"" ones  Bass Pro also sells a 30"" and the site rates it for the same size boat its $34 or so.....who knows if its just as good or better (?)   forrest"
185111,irishfield,2008-04-10 23:27:00,26272,"Don't know Forrest... I have a big one in the boat that the wife bought me for fathers day... 'cause someone at BPS pointed out I could probably use one. Hasn't been out of the bag and probably never will be.. unless I change how I fish. I can troll my Lund at 0.3MPH, if I need to.. up to 5.8MPH on the kicker. After that I just use the big motor."
