184812,workwear,2008-04-10 12:24:00,592,greetings to all......was wondering what you guys recomend for carbon build up on piston heads......i was told to open her up for a few miles that should help...any ideas??  cheers
184819,Flyboy,2008-04-10 12:51:00,26,Check out this product if you can find it locally here in GTA (please post source)  http://www.seafoamsales.com/motorTuneUpTechGas.htm  I've used it once and was happy with the de-carboning results. There is a following out there that endorse this cleaner for outboards (outboard cleaner version) and small engines as well.  Big Cliff?
184822,Billy Bob,2008-04-10 12:54:00,5865,Spray  a LITTLE Brake Clean through the carb when running along the dock. Just don't use too much at a time. If Brake Clean doesn't clean it out nothing will.  You will immediately hear the motor open up and it  will bring a smile on your face.

Funny though the original paint seal on them had never been broken, my brother noticed it, and my uncle changed marine dealers."
184829,workwear,2008-04-10 13:17:00,592,thxs guys...its a fuel injected so i cant spray anything into the carb......i looked no barb....lol...anyways i look at that cleaner fly boy recomended...........my bud who is a mechanic says i should never use additives.....hell i dont know......to use or not to use....i guess this is the question
184830,Muskieman,2008-04-10 13:22:00,2472,Cannot go wrong with SEAFOAM    # sf16   ...9.99$ per can   awesome stuff.  Randy
184833,workwear,2008-04-10 13:26:00,592,and where would i spray this into......is a mixture in which i put it into the gas tank.......??
184835,Muskieman,2008-04-10 13:28:00,2472,Gas tank or vacuum line... I sell it every day and use it myself in all my motors.... Ice auger to Pick up truck.

184855,Oktravis,2008-04-10 13:51:00,62,"Acdelco makes stuff called ""cleens combustion chamber cleaner"" it is an arousal. I have used it to clear up engine misfires where carbon build up on valves was the problem. Spray it in to the intake with the engine running. I have also had good luck with seafoam in a spray bottle sprayed in to the intake. good luck travis"
184904,boatman,2008-04-10 16:21:00,350,Seafoam. Since you can't spray into the carb just mix 1 can to 1 gallon gas. Go for a run at WOT until the gas is gone and/or the engine stops smoking. And it will smoke like crazy.
184926,Billy Bob,2008-04-10 16:57:00,5865,It doesn't matter if you have fuel injection the motor still sucks air and that's where you want to spray in some Brake Kleen or whatever you decide on. But as I said before just spry a little bit at a time until you hear the engine open up and you will.  Bob
185024,SBCregal,2008-04-10 20:36:00,688,"i'll second the GM KLEENS product, they have 2, one is an aerosol can and you spray it in the intake of the motor, and one is a liquid that you suck up through a vacuum line.  its alot like seafoam but i've found it works better,  i use it on anything with a motor.  you use about half to 2/3 of the product, a little at a time revving the motor a bit above idle then when the bottle is almost gone suck it up until the engine stalls out.  wait 20 mins or so and fire up the motor... be outside somewhere as it'll smoke.... A LOT!!!!! should eliminate any pinging, poor performance etc.  i found the motor will be a bit more powerful and fuel consumption gets a bit better (in these days, every bit helps)"
185068,2 tone z71,2008-04-10 22:08:00,1311,workwear all the OEMS have there own carbon guard for there products that work very well or like stated you cannot go wrong with seafoam
185093,Sinker,2008-04-10 22:56:00,8692,"I have used seafoam, and it is great stuff. I also use Mercury Power Tuner once in a while for a quick fix. Its pretty good too, but I like the seafoam better. I just mix the seafoam in a gallon of gas and let er rip until its gone.  The power tuner you spray in the intake until the motor stalls, let it sit for a half hour, then take er for a rip at WOT until the smoke clears.  Both  work great.  The super tuner is available at any mercury dealer. I find its easier to get than the seafoam.  Sinker"
