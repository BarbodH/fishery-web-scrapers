185493,richyb,2008-04-11 16:41:00,774,i have heard people talking about using big stinky minows for channel cats.  i was out shopping today and seen a big bag of frozen smelts .  Then i got thinking ... Is it legal to use  dead smelts for channel cats ? and would they work ?  thanks guys.

I use the size that says that there is about 70 shrimps per bag.  the bag is about $6.99 so it ios a lot cheaper than using worms.   I know that the cats in the Ottawa river just love those shrimps.  here's one that got fooled by a no-name shrimp.
