Of course, he was the hit of the party and he stayed after and must have signed hundreds of autographs.  Each one with the same high level of energy and enthusiasm.  It was a beautiful thing to witness. Some of todays 'stars' could sure take a lesson from this caring Canadian!  "
185103,alan77,2008-04-10 23:13:00,2,"I agree, now a days it's all about the $$$$$.  Good to see someone with a heart.  Way to go Cherry!"
185106,LundGuy,2008-04-10 23:15:00,169,Shows you can be controversial and a very special person at the same time. Its called being human. Good guy and I bet he didn't charge for his autograph as some of these meat heads do today.
185110,Puckhead,2008-04-10 23:26:00,377,Guarantee he didn't charge a dime - I've met Cherry a few times at one of his restaurants a few years back.  Always a great guy...
185119,silveradosheriff,2008-04-10 23:38:00,1025, 100% Correct!!!
185238,crappieperchhunter,2008-04-11 02:23:00,2582,Cherry was at a Oshawa Generals game when my sons team was one of the teams on the ice between intermissions for the TIMBITS hockey thing. After the game one of the kids spotted Cherry just walking around. Our kids just swarmed him. It was totally unrehearsed. He talked to every kid and gave them all autographs. And I think he enjoyed it just as much as the kids did. Class Act all the way.
185241,sconceptor,2008-04-11 02:27:00,146,"I've heard a few stories about Don, and he's nothing but class!!!!!! Talk to the kids and parents, signs lots of autographs, does lots of events, has a charity in the name of his wife, etc............He's a beauty!!!!"
185289,kennyman,2008-04-11 04:43:00,737,"You gotta love him. Great the way he shows so mush respect and always has something good to say about the men and women who protect this great land, past and present. He really does care. He a ""good ole Kingston boy"" like Kirk and Dougie."
185294,jediangler,2008-04-11 05:00:00,1923,"Good Kingston boy like the boys from the Tragically Hip. If you've never seen it, here is a link to Cherry acting as a chickenman with the Trailer Park Boys in the video for ""The Darkest One"". Watch how easily he nearly knocks Ricky off balance while pushing Julian & Bubs with the other arm.  "
185302,jonnybass,2008-04-11 07:29:00,346,"Definitely one of the greatest Canadians ever, love him or hate him."
185342,ccmtcanada,2008-04-11 11:42:00,7971,"I heard the CBC is making a TV movie about his hockey and family life.  It was ritten by his son.  At any rate...like him or not, he's an excellent ambassador for Canadian hockey!"
185346,blaque,2008-04-11 11:53:00,2419,"Well respected and very well liked down here in the states as well. Im only a boat ride across the niagara river before im in canada, but still..........the man is a legend and i dont know of anyone who ever said they didnt like the guy. Straight shooter for sure........and a wonderful canadian spokesperson."
185428,Headhunter,2008-04-11 14:36:00,5703,"Don's the MAN! I met him at an autograph session in First Canadian Place a few years ago... dwon to earth, honest and loaded with common sense... Don Cherry for Prime Minister! HH"
