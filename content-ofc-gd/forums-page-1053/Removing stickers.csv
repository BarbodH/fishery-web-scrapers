184911,Wendel,2008-04-10 16:32:00,213,"Well, I'm trying to take the old registration numbers off the boat. I'm out here with a pastic scraper and a hairdryer, and they aren't coming off easy.  Anyone have any tried tested and true methods?  I don't want to damage the paint underneath or I would just get out my propane torch lol Would a heat gun work better perhaps? I've got goo gone, thought about scoring the stickers and putting that on, but like I said don't want to scratch the paint underneath..."
184913,Raf,2008-04-10 16:42:00,3495,lighter fluid possibly.
184917,tinbanger,2008-04-10 16:50:00,1028,"On our old aluminum boat used a safty razor to lift an edge of the old sticker , could get most off in 4 or five pieces .Then 'goof off' to remove any small pieces and residue . Didn't hurt the paint ..but it was a 25 yr old boat  worked good.  TB"
184919,danbo,2008-04-10 16:50:00,2646,"Just get one corner lifted off, then use needle-nose pliers & slowly roll it off. Then clean the glue off with window cleaner."
184920,Tinman,2008-04-10 16:52:00,376,"when i worked cleaning cars, we got the sticker off with a heat gun"
184924,Roy,2008-04-10 16:53:00,13728,"Different kinds of glue on those stickers. Some come off clean with WD-40, others need alcohol. Should some glue remain on the paint, use either a mild dish detergent or babyoil with a plastic scrub pad to avoid damage to the paint finish."
184932,wallyboss,2008-04-10 17:10:00,1095,Not sure how to remove the actual numbers but any residue  Goo Gone will take care of it and will not harm finish
184935,Headhunter,2008-04-10 17:16:00,5703,I've some success with rubbing alcohol in removing stickers and such. HH
184937,Maverick,2008-04-10 17:23:00,371,hair dryer / heat gun and goo gone for the residue
184941,eye-tracker,2008-04-10 17:34:00,89,"Wendel,  Warm the vinyl and surface up with a hair dyer so it is warm - it is going to be difficult as you need to get the aluminum to stay warm. Use a soft plastic scraper to get under an edge and then slowly remove while heating with a hair dryer. Once you have them all removed spray on Go-Gone and let it soak into the glue residue for 5 to 10 minutes. Then use a soft cloth to rub off the glue. Once complete rinse down with water so no go-gone is on the surface. If you have any oil remaining on the surface your new vinyl will fall off after a few weeks.  This technique has worked for me over the years as I add and remove 30 to 40 vinyl logos and text items from my truck, boat and motor every season.  Take your time and as I mentioned it is a difficult time of the year to do out-side as the metal surface will not want to stay warm.  Good Luck,  -sheldon"

184953,Wendel,2008-04-10 17:59:00,213,"Thanks for all the responses...  I'm going to try the heat gun method tomorrow, I'll post pictures of how it turned out later...."
184963,PERCHER,2008-04-10 18:36:00,787,I am with Roy WD40
184967,shane,2008-04-10 18:53:00,652,I'm with Headhunter with the rubbing alchohol. Took twenty year old stickers off my fridge.  Go for the 99% isopropyl if you can get it.  Roy is right about the different kinds of glue tho'.
184982,chubbon,2008-04-10 19:19:00,15,3M adhesive remover is the best stuff out there. We would use it on our transport trucks when we were changing companies to take the stickers off the doors. you can find it anywhere that carries automotive paints and supplies.
184984,Bernie,2008-04-10 19:23:00,3190,The most effective stuff is brake and parts cleaner. Available in auto supply stores. Takes most types of sticky stuff off. Cheap  too. I was told one time its similar to dry cleaning solution.

185031,irishfield,2008-04-10 20:52:00,26272,Nail polish remover contains Acetone. Fine with some cured paints... will eat others just like the nail polish it removes! Wouldn't be my choice.  3M decal remover or the heat gun on low/medium without bubbling the paint.
185045,Deano,2008-04-10 21:22:00,767,"Always used gas line antifreeze, cheap and works good on getting the glue off."
185084,forrest,2008-04-10 22:45:00,1032,Goo Gone  By far is the best I have ever used.  forrest
185151,Wendel,2008-04-11 00:21:00,213,"Well... I have an answer... The best way to remove the stickers is to tell your girlfriend exactly what you need to do, and then come home 3 hours later to find she had done it! She said she used a heat gun, a plastic scraper, and then goo gone. Now I just have to buy her dinner and we are even lol"
185157,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-11 00:25:00,314,Wendel method is the only perfect method !!!!!!!!  Anything that takes time a patience isnt for any man!  except FISHING
185192,HTHM,2008-04-11 01:00:00,4082,How about a very strong power washer?
185505,mikethespike,2008-04-11 16:54:00,51,"steam is the least destructive way i've found to remove pesky stickers from chrome bumpers, refrigerators, etc.  i use a shark steamer or something similar and give it a couple of blasts, if its a small sticker i'd use a steam iron.  this will get the plastic/vinyl part of the sticker then i finish of the remaining gunk with either gigaloo or wd40."
