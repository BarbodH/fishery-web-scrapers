Hit the water at 6:30 a.m. and the fishing was pretty well non-stop until I called it quits @ 10:30 a.m. this morning.  GCD - They've got a little more color to them already...   Started using the pink trout worms, and the gills were hitting them like crazy, but after I hooked into my 3rd OOS rainbow I decided to switch it up to a pink micro tube so I could keep the bow's off my line.  Boated well over 50 gills, missed countless others and kept a dozen for the table.         2 biggest of the day were a heafty 10.5 inches.    Have fun out there and be safe, UF"

189696,Greencoachdog,2008-04-20 00:27:00,8163,"Yup! Great report and pics!!!  ... by the color of those 'Gills it looks like the water is still cold but warming up there.  I can't tell exactly, but it looks like there's a few Redear Sunfish mixed in with the 'Gills there?  Maybe you should've done a Steelhead report with the Trout pic eh!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post!!!"
