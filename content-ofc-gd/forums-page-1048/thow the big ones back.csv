189751,Ramble,2008-04-20 01:29:00,713,  Can explain your thought on teh subject a little more? I'm curious as to what exactly you mean by this.  -R-
189758,forrest,2008-04-20 01:47:00,1032, My thoughts on what bramptonjerry said were that the limits have to be dynamic or different for predator fish.  Lets say 1 fish over X size and 4 under X size.  Both Large and small fish have to be taken in proportion to each other or there may end up being a situation where there are a lot of big predator fish and not enough smaller fish to feed on.  The only qualified statement my education/experience allows me to say is: the small fish taste better.  forrest
189810,Cookslav,2008-04-20 04:42:00,1457, The Single barbless/No kill zoneing on the Grand has done tremendous things for the Brownie population...might not be a bad idea for some other areas? And I Can't say the local trout anglers would be to upset.
189813,Musky or Specks,2008-04-20 04:48:00,2710,"Except make it self sustaining which was the goal of the whole project to begin with.  Youd be suprised how upset anglers get when you try to take fishing opportunities away. To use your own example a huge stink was raised by the pike anglers on the Grand river because the use of live bait was being prohibited. Not that they couldnt keep the pike, just the WAY they could fish for them."
189834,Cookslav,2008-04-20 05:29:00,1457,"I was under the impression the Brownie population in the Grand was doing well and has seen a riseing sustaining population? At least thats what I've been told? The rainbow stocking went the way of the dinosaur...although I saw a post last year of a young rainbow caught in the Zone, and they haven't been stocked in a while (not gonna say were outta respect for the poster)"
189836,Musky or Specks,2008-04-20 05:39:00,2710,Actually the bows might be better at naturally sustaining themselves than the browns. Every year people report unclipped rainbows being caught. The brown trout however dont do so well. The flow regime of the dam wreaks havoc with spawning redds washing them out and suffocating them with fines(silt deposits)We spent a lot of money intially to build a spawning channel for them. They used it successfully there were fish spawning all over it in October. Entire channel was wiped out in spring floods before any hatching could take place. They are hoping that some of the tribs might be able to produce young but the Grand is essentially a fish farm.
189249,Ramble,2008-04-18 19:00:00,713,"This is a good thread fellas.....aside for a touch of hostility every now and then lol  Cold water streams in southern ontario are a dying bread. I understand pretty well what all of the arguments are here....but i'm going to have to side with habitat loss as THE major concern. Genetics is definatly #2 for preserving a species like brookies, but controlling the gene pool is pointless if the habitat doesn't exist. First and formest the habitat needs to be protected. Once that is done, efforts to restore the gene pool should definalty be the next step. But protecting habitat is HARD to do in southern Ontario.    What I understand here so far, is that Muskey or Specks is saying that we should protect the genes 1st.  At first i was skeptical of this approach, but i think i understand now. Habitat loss is the major concern for brookies....but harvesting of breaders is also a major problem. Controlling what fish are kept through the regs is a H3LL of a lot easier then rehabilitating the streams which are in trouble. The genetcis aspect is a very easy fix though regulation compared to stream rehab....which takes a lot of time and money.Plus for streams which are healthy it positivly benifits the whole fishery. As for the disagreement between Muskey or Specks and Dan...they are arguing the same thing....using a different method. I think what needs to be done with the population is a 2 stage regulatory approach. 1st would be to protect the large spawning fish like Muskey or Specks suggested until the population demographic can rebound, and we can get some of teh bigger fish back. Once the population demographics of the fish have reached better proportions then implement  regs like Dan was suggesting where the late life fish are harvested. This technique should foster the breaders to remain in the population.  This kind of thinking inevatibly leads to a slot size approach for protection of the key breaders. Protection of the fish which will have the most spawning still to do ONLY makes sence.    Greencoach brings up another point, the biologists SHOULD know whats going on. HOWEVER I feel that for southern ontario the brookie regulations for wild populations are FAR too lax. Especially for small streams which have unique populations....there is no way the MNR biologists  know what each streams population is doing.  I think the regs need to change for brookies and err more on the side of caution, and for southern ontario they should be listed as a threatened species.    My overal point here is that any plan needs to consider both genetics and habitat TOGETHER. At our current stage, putting more effort into protecting the genetics only makes sence since it's teh easiest to fix though regulations.  Anyway, thats my interpration and 2 cents.  -R-"
189257,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 19:14:00,2710,"Excellent post you've got the gist of the point Im trying to make. Although I never said protection of the gene pool should be first, the threads original post is about genes so thats were my original contribution came in. Heck bios dont know hardly anything about the waters they are working with. Ive been informed of coldwater habitat I didnt know existed many times. Its anglers who need to participate in fisheries planning meetings and other public interations with the regulators that leads to a sharing of knowledge and a protection of all species. As for the touch of hostility, I kind of look at it as a bunch of guys passionately argueing about their favourite sports player/team. You might get excited and disagree about specifics but the fact of the matter is we all love the game."

It's an eye opener for sure. You might appreciate Robs work a little more after you read it. Dr. Cook did nothing more than catch a fish. Rob saved the planet."
189499,bigfish1965,2008-04-19 13:54:00,3382,"I'm not a biologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.  There are two different factors when trying to manage stocks and genes. One is viability the other is genetic value. This is one of the reasons we see slot limits. It does both...protects the more prolific spawners in the mid-size range and protects the less prolific, but more valued trophy size fish genes. This assumes a certain life span. I was not aware of the 5 year lifespan of brook trout. This certainly complicates things as far as fitting into the common mold."
189520,Cookslav,2008-04-19 15:21:00,1457," Ummm Kitchener is a City, not a town and your a LIAR!!! There are no fish in Kitchener.... (kidding of course)   Habitat loss is surely a major issue for Specs in this area particularily but so is our ""so called"" climate change. Many springs are starting to dry up in this area....Aberfoyle, and Formasa areas comes to mind. I've also seen a huge flow reduction is some Nith River feeder streams as well. Then you have the rapid spread of Brownies moving into river areas once considered Speck habitat to boot.  But for the most part I think most of this urban Speck fishing Debate is kinda redundent... When it comes to keeping fish in an otherwised comprimised area I think its a no brainer not to keep any at all is it not? Besides when catching fish in an urban area I definatly wouldn't keep any for consumption....Especially anything I caught around here LOL!"

The province levies a one-time $3,000 processing fee on complicated water permits that need a scientific evaluation.

188990,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 03:24:00,2710," Heres a good read for you  ""The truth is that large brook trout vanished from our big freestone streams when northcentral Pennsylvania  became readily accessible to anglers. With the opening of roads and the coming of the automobile, fishing pressure was intense, and the brook trout population was quickly decimated. It only took about 20 years. The limit was 40 a day around the turn-of-the-century; it was reduced to 30 a day shortly thereafter and to 25 a day before 1920. Catching a limit was not difficult, and there was little thought given to limiting the catch. The resource was believed to be limitless.   By 1940 it was all over.  In sterile freestone waters like those in Pennsylvania,  brook trout grow at best at an average rate of about 2 inches per year. They have the potential to live about 7 years, and can live as long as 10 years. This corresponds very nicely with sizes documented in turn-of-the-century  angling literature. But they need time and space, and this is what they no longer have. Brook trout are extremely sensitive to angling pressure and in heavily fished waters like ours seldom survive more than three years, the age at which they generally reach harvestable size. It's not very complicated:  This is why native brook trout now average six inches in length and a ten  inch fish is a trophy in waters that once teemed with 9- to 12-inch brookies.  Since about 1940, the large freestone  streams of Pennsylvania have been primarily managed as put-and-take fisheries.  Instead of limiting angler harvest, wild fish populations were supplemented  with hatchery trout. This seemed logical at the time. Nature was thought to be inefficient and wasteful, and with hatcheries man could easily and cheaply replace wild fish with domesticated versions. It would no longer be necessary to wait years for trout to mature. They could be put in the stream one day and caught the next. We still have thousands of miles of freestone streams with sufficient natural reproduction to support an extensive  wild trout fishery. The best are located in the northcentral section, centered  around Potter County. But now, just as the water is beginning to warm in the early spring sun, millions of hatchery fish are dumped into these streams.  Recent biological studies have shown that the stocking of hatchery trout into streams with wild trout populations is a disaster for the wild trout. Hatchery fish are bigger and much more aggressive than wild fish and utter chaos results. The whole orderly system established by the resident fish collapses. Imagine what would happen if your neighborhood was suddenly occupied by a horde of big, ill-mannered, aggressive strangers who had nothing to eat except your food and nowhere to stay but your house. When streams containing wild trout are stocked, the number and size of the wild fish plummets. Conversely, when stocking is halted in streams with naturally reproducing trout, wild trout numbers and size increase dramatically. And, worst of all, stocking draws an army of anglers, many of whom are there to ""limit out."" The toll is enormous. The streams are quickly stripped of both wild and stocked trout. Repeat stockings are required every few weeks, just to meet the demand. The disaster that occurred earlier in this century is replayed every year now, starting on the opening day of each trout season.  Treating streams which are perfectly capable of supporting viable wild trout fisheries as though they are nothing more than counters from which to dispense expensive, domesticated hatchery trout is an incredible waste of increasingly rare and valuable resources. And imagine what is being done to the irreplaceable genetic diversity of our native brook trout populations. It took literally millions of years for  these fish to evolve. Now those fish genetically coded to mature early in life while small in size, spawn and die, are heavily favored. There is no longer any survival advantage to long life and large size. As anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of natural selection knows, the species will adapt to fit the environment. Extinction is the only alternative. Make no mistake about it, these fish are highly adaptable and will survive, but their ability to live long lives and reach large size will be lost forever if we continue on the present course. ""  Source  http://www.patrout.org/brook.htm  You have an astounding ability to not absorb what your reading,the size of ""prime spawners"" is six inches in southern ontario, to the point that their genes overwelm any fish that might be later maturing. Once a fish hits sexual maturity its growth becomes limited. A six inch fish that is mature will only be six -eight inches long at the time of its death. A ten inch fish which might not even be sexually mature has a much greater chance of being harvested as an eater size fish because of the angling pressure berfore it ever has a chance to pass on its superior genes. The regs I suggest are very similar to what exist on the Nip they are just different sizes. The regs almost exist right now on the Credit River where only 1 fish may be kept over 18 "" The reason I said keep four under 8"" was to encourage the culling of genetically inferior fish and allow ample angling opportunity. Believe me it wouldnt be many years and everyone would be complaining that 8"" is way to small and they never catch them small enough to keep anymore. Ask the guys who fish Parry Sound for Lakers. Again your a layperson so I dont expect you to totally get it. But its Darwinism at work as quicky as regs could make it while still appealing to those who like to have brook trout for the dinner table. Would the regs stay that way forever, who can say? Its all about angler education. People on the Nipigon and Superior systems have come to accept a one brook trout limit. My dream is to have people in southern ontario accept it as well."

188992,Musky or Specks,2008-04-18 03:28:00,2710,Dr Cook put the Nip on the map. People have been traveling to fish the Nipigon since long before Rob was born and will continue to fish it long after he is gone but he has left an important legacy. I still have one of the Save a Brook Trout Turn out the Lights T shirts somewhere in my closet.
