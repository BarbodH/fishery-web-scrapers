189472,Big Cliff,2008-04-19 10:19:00,6899,"Had a yard sale here about four years ago and I had a lot of old fishing tackle (some still in the original packages) that I knew I wasn't going to be using any more so I decided to sell it too. A lot of it was duplicates that I had bought (I always buy 2 of anything new to try) and for one reason or another didn't use it any more, some was part of a lot of stuff I'd purchased when a tackle shop was closing.  I sold a few items but toward the end of the day this young boy came by and I could see he was quite interested in it. He spent about 20 minutes looking at things and asking ""how much?"" but hadn't bought anything. I had been a little busy with some other people that had stopped by but when they left I got a chance to talk with him, seems he only had $2.35 and was trying to decide where he could best spend his money. Well it was his lucky day, since it was the end of the day and this stuff hadn't sold I decided to put a LOT price on all the fishing tackle and it just happened to be $2.00 (couldn't take his last $0.35). You should have seen his face LOL. $2.00 for everything (fishing tackle) well the kid went home with a fairly good size box filled with stuff and a smile on his face you couldn't have beaten off with a brick.  I saw him fishing several times that summer at the local marina but they moved away that fall; I often wonder if my junk got a kid into fishing, I'd like to think so!"
