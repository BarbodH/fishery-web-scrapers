189961,kickingfrog,2008-04-20 17:14:00,8333,I went for a bicycle ride today. East wind in Barrie has blown the remaining ice on Kempenfelt Bay to wards the Barrie shoreline right now. About a 100 metres worth. Lots of people fishing the marina which only had a little bit of frazzle ice in the one corner. Only saw perch being caught. It was good to see lots of families fishing.
