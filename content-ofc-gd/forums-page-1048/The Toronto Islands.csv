189225,Anglermark,2008-04-18 18:01:00,2,"I went up the Toronto Islands on April 8th but of course, I went way too early. Ice still filled the channels and there were no fish in sight (not a surprise, but I wanted to be sure myself). I think I'm going to be heading up there next week with a few buddies to check it out again.  Is it worth the trip? Or should I wait till the beginning of May? Has anyone had any luck? Or heard any stories?  -Mark"
189248,BillM,2008-04-18 18:59:00,17367,What are you fishing for?  Pike's closed for another couple of weeks.
189252,capt bruce,2008-04-18 19:02:00,820,"Better not go untill the season opens , bass is a long way off , pike is a few weeks maybe get  a carp but lots of other places on the city side for carp why pay the 650  fairy fee ???"
189276,mepps,2008-04-18 20:07:00,1301,When ever I have fished TO Islands on pike opener I run into a few guys.  I alway ask how the day has been and 3 out of 4 guys will tell you it was much better last week...guess no one reads the regs.
189278,John,2008-04-18 20:22:00,2956,I think that Mark made this post so that he could sell his boat in our classifieds..........too bad he didn't think about what he was posting.

189524,dsn,2008-04-19 15:47:00,1018,"I'll save you the trip. No fish to be found cause there are no green weeds anywhere as of yet from wards island to hanlans point.  ""Not even a carp to be found."" Which was what I was looking for. Give til May. They try again.  dsn"
189651,Anglermark,2008-04-19 22:46:00,2,"I was looking to go after Carp, not Pike. I'm aware of the restrictions John and like stated before, I had an old account but had to create a new one.  Thanks to everyone for the replies, I guess I'll have to wait longer till the ice thaws out around the island"
