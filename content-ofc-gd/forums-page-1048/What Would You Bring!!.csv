You think it has bass pike muskie and other game fish in it. You are under the impression that you are packing ""light"". You are allowed to bring the following: One plastic container full of soft plastics lures whatever. (The container should hold no more than 10 lures) and 2 rods.  I got this idea from a friend.    I would bring a medium action 6'6 spinning combo, and a 7"" medium heavy spinning combo. As for the lures: One deep running crankbait, one shallow running crankbait, one shallow running jerkbait, white spinnerbait, black blue bass jig, yum dingers, berkly gulp jerk shad, topwater popper, silver spoon, and a buzzbait."
