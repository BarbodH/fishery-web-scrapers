I was hoping to go fish somewhere tomorrow before i start working Monday (i'm in a co-op program) I saw a few crappie report last 2 weeks or so ... is it still on? I'm probably going to the Simcoe area ...  i have never gone crappie fishing before so i have no idea when they'd still around ... if it's too late i'll probably jus go find some suckers.  thanks!

But once you have spent a couple seasons learning about crappies and the best spots you will bring home the BEST fish fries known to man kind.  BTW the season just started and you have to ABOUT the end of May to take advantage of this time of year.  Good Luck, Bob"
