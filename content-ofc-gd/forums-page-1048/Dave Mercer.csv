188583,Gerritt,2008-04-17 11:09:00,6129,Hahahahha Mr. Perfect!!! now that brings back memories!  some interesting threads back then!  G
188586,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-17 11:16:00,2050,"That's before my time here - but Dave still tries to get on here as much as he can to see what's goin on.  I actually met him and got my job with Dave Mercer Outdoors through OFC.  He's probably the busiest guy I've ever met in my life.  He's become insanely busy with tv appearances, semenars etc. etc. the last couple of years but refuses to fish any less then he did before so he's rarely by the computer.  Cheers, UF"
188591,lew,2008-04-17 11:32:00,12767," Marc, are you referring to the Perfect Angler from 4 or 5 years back  ??  Fun times fer sure and some hilarious stuff back then !!"
188711,Kirk,2008-04-17 17:32:00,347,So did we ever figure out who that was?  I can't believe it was 5 years ago.
188735,lew,2008-04-17 18:02:00,12767,"Yup, some of us know Kirk, but have been sworn to everlasting secrecy, but I can tell you that he's still with us here on OFC"
188746,capt bruce,2008-04-17 18:23:00,820,"Dave is a great guy who seams to have endless energy . Took my son to a kids fishing tourament once when he was younger ,Dave and a few others were there , Dave spent some time  with him teaching him how to fish the small jerk bait he wanted to use  , my son  went on to win that day useing those techniques and when we ran into Dave a year later at the weigh in at another tourament he remembered my sons name and joked with him about that day . Cant say how much it ment to the kid that he remembered him (he  has at least one fan for life and down came the BoB Isumi picture on his wall and up went the picture of Dave)a great guy and a GREAT ambassador for our sport."
188771,ccmtcanada,2008-04-17 19:06:00,7971,"I don't know about this Dave guy.  I saw him at Gagnon's last weekend giving advice on fishing tactics and lures.  I saw him cast lure after lure in that tank...landing right in front of the fish and he didn't catch anything at all.  I mean...it was a bit embarassing to watch.  All kidding aside, Dave seems like a great guy...his new show rocks and he seems very down to earth!"
188839,bpsbassman,2008-04-17 22:48:00,941,I've had many opportunities to talk to Dave at BPS.  A better ambassadeur for our your sport you will not find anywhere. Unbelievable positive influence on the kids. I think he was telling me that he has 2500 Mercer Mercenaries!
188970,BillM,2008-04-18 02:47:00,17367,"I would really like to meet Dave in person.  If he is anything like his show, he seems like an absolute riot and an awesome fishing partner."
189020,Marc Thorpe,2008-04-18 08:42:00,621,"Yes Lew the Perfect Angler The Thread Tittle "" ME ""  The banner add made me think of it He also brings a refreshing side"
189079,Chris,2008-04-18 13:12:00,405,Lew:  Hahahaha I remember him too. What a cad.
189085,lew,2008-04-18 13:22:00,12767," He sure did give us lots to laff at though, eh Chris ??  Dood was a pretty good fisherman too"
189090,Roy,2008-04-18 13:31:00,13728,"Yeah Chris, whoever he was, I wouldn't mind spending a day or two in a boat with the dood learnin' stuff. I hear he ain't too far away from me either. :-)"
189212,smokinall4s,2008-04-18 17:34:00,89,My kids and I met and chatted with Dave last year during his KIDS FACTS OF FISHING derby at Ontario Place. He talked to the kids and answered their questions. I think he's a great guy and the kids loved seeing hime and getting a fishing card of him. Which he also signed for both of them. We can't wait for this years derby.
