Unfortunately the largemouth were really on and couldnt keep them off our lines. Managed one tiny crappie and finally changed up our presentation to slip floats with a Berkely Power Maggot on a single hook. It was like magic and we couldnt keep the bluegills off. We met this awesome guy from Woodstock named Pete. If your a member here Pete PM me we can exchange some more info.  Heres a couple of pics      Looking forward to trout opener now just have to decide wether its Algonquinn or creek troutin it.
