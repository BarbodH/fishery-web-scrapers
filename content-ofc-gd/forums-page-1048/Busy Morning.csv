189364,mistyriver1,2008-04-19 00:30:00,600,Nothing wrong with golf at all Brian.  You've got a PM.
189367,Joey,2008-04-19 00:37:00,9122,"Oh dear lord, where is Brian and what have you done with him  I used to enjoy a round or two myself B.  It can either be relaxing or frustrating, depending on your game  But you are right, it is good exercise.  Good for you hon.  Joey"
189384,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-19 01:18:00,1183, lol...you must be over 40!!!
189387,brooks999,2008-04-19 01:23:00,38, +1 ....I have to shoot up a duke after a bad shot......and there are many <------ Understatement to say the least   I do walk the course though so I tell myself it equals out a bit
189542,misfish,2008-04-19 16:25:00,29133," Is that a good thing or a bad thing,being over 40 that is?"
189592,bassfighter,2008-04-19 19:23:00,366,"Golf is a challenging sport , fun to play , but is not an easy one. It is as challenging as any other sport. You have 13 clubs to master, and different course to encounter, power and finesse is needed. If you have the time, Go at at. Walking for few miles is good for one's health, similar to fishing, patience and concentration is very much needed.  If you try to hang out with people who do not smoke or who are more health contiuos, you will be influence by them as well. To do well in golf, one needs to be discipline to practice on the driving range, you are your worse friend and enemy on the course. Getting lesson would always help to avoid acquiring bad habits.  I play competitive tennis and fish seriously, if I have extra time, I don't mind adding golf here and there, unless one put their effort into a particular sport, no one will fully understand or appreciate it.  To those who never fish, they assumed all we do is put a worm on a hook, drop it on the water, tie the line on our toe and wait for hours or go take a nap, until a fish stricks.  To those who do not golf, it seemed silly to drive a small ball at a far distance on a hole that we cannot even see. It seemed to be a laid back sport, until Tiger wood proved that one needs to be healthy and fit these days to even play golf. Golf is the fastest growing sport among young people today, Callaway stock's, the golf club manufacturer , has been growing steadily in years. The sport is almost a must for most businessman these days, particularly in conducting international business.  Clublink has some deals after twilight special. The course at Warden and sttouville cost only $12-$14 after 4:00pm for 18 holes, and takes at least 3.5 hours to finish, a good decent beginner course. They have different level course, the last course cost only $22 after 4:00pm and takes 5 hours to finish.  I spend an average of 10+ fishing hours and $40 gas money (per person) each outing. Golf can be cheaper and less time consuming these days. If one golf with the right person, a boss , or an important business contacts, who knows it might even help us get a raise or close a contract for a business project.  Golf is considered a political sport."
189670,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-19 23:28:00,1183,  It's good for me...Gramps...
189152,misfish,2008-04-18 15:29:00,29133,"Well I failed to mention one of my duties today was to see the doc. I did that right after visiting my field,and yes the turkeys are back. Oh the gas prices suck too.    Then I did a bit of post birthday shopping. Sorry again for poor picture quality.    On my travels to the doc I took a pic of the bay. I would say it will be wide open by sunday.    Like I said,the doc says I need to get out and excerise,and cut down on the puffs,  . So I was wondering what I could do that would give me fresh air and excerise and still enjoy it. Well many years back I was a very avid golfer and gave it up about 10 years ago.I thought to myself why not give it a go. Sooooooooooooooo,I bought a new outfit (The hock shop had a new set there,Wilsons bag and all 90 bucks,I was at Nevada Bobs,they were 279 bucks. Sweet deal.) So now I am  off to swing at a few little white balls.   "
189158,Gerritt,2008-04-18 15:34:00,6129,Brian.... I have a set of Tommy Armour 745s and a Big Bertha driver with a bag I would have given you.  NM your a lefty!  G
189163,Headhunter,2008-04-18 15:44:00,5703,"If your anything like me, playin golf won't help with the smokin thing! LOL I smoke more golfing, than pretty much any other time! Add the power cart into the mix and well... you get the idea! Thanks for the bay pic! HH"
189170,Roy,2008-04-18 15:57:00,13728,My Gawd!!! They've abducted me son! We'll get you out of there Brian...just hang tight.

You need more than a GP to help you out in the health department bud.  ............................Get some help and take them clubs back to the shop. You think the pump prices are bad??

189205,smokinall4s,2008-04-18 17:10:00,89,"Golfing can be a stressless sport, unless you golf like me (always in the woods). But you need a more stressless sport, fishing. So use the clubs but only until Trout season starts up. Then put the clubs away until winter time (indoor range)."
189207,irishfield,2008-04-18 17:15:00,26272,"Man Brian... if you had of told me you were switchin to golf... I would have beat you with the set I have behind the 12 foot shear in the hangar, when you were here yesterday!  And Andy... good to ""see"" you as well Bud !"
189211,Bly,2008-04-18 17:32:00,1556,"ACK!!!!  Say it isn't so..please!  Ok, time to rally the troups for an intervention, not sure we can save him but we have to try!!   Brian, just try and hang in there, help is on the way and in the meantime....stay AWAY from those little round white things, don't want to be loosing them.........."
189213,Big Cliff,2008-04-18 17:41:00,6899,"No No No! This has to be some kind of a joke, someone has figured out how to post under his name, Mods, get all over this thing quick, report that IP address, it's been hijacked! misfish, GOLF? Never NO unless hell has frozen over and then he'd go ice fishing. Roy, pick me up on your way through, we'll get the sod that's trying to give our buddy a hard time, I'll sit on him and you can pour old milwackie down his throat and blow smoke in his eyes."
189214,edmichit,2008-04-18 17:41:00,145,"If your looking for Turkeys.......the golf course is a good place to find many of them......come to think of it, lots of similarities...they often group up, they strut around all fancy like......and many have spikes on....they do however respond to a different type of calling....but i'm sure if you yelled ""tom"" at the golf course you would get an answer back...you might even find an old hen or two, to ruin your day."
189215,Big Cliff,2008-04-18 17:43:00,6899,Tree30eight: Too funny!
189220,misfish,2008-04-18 17:54:00,29133,"Now now now,lets not get our rods all bent out of shape (sorry Bly,not you) Way back I use to fish and play golf ""ALL THE TIME"",just ask the mrs,s.   I dropped one,(golf) and stuck to just fishing. I cant explain WHY,I just dont have the bug to get out. Yes it does bother me,but hey,life is what it is. Seeing the waters open had be thinking and Im sure it wont be long til I get back to the fishing thing.No INTERVENTION required. I have to say,it was nice to get the feel of the swing and hitting the ball. Like riding a bike,you never forget,but the body functions seemed to be off a bit.  Now I see why the doc said excerise. Man I got a few tight and sore musles from just smacking around a small bucket of those little white guys, Like they say,no pain,no gain. FYI,I have lost 20 pounds the last 3 months,I feel good, but need to get things in shape.  HH, no cart bud,thats why I figured ,I would get the clubs out. WALK WALK.  G, as always,great offer. Did you know most courses are built for left handers? Thats why the righties have such a hard time.  So if anyone wants to hit a course and talk about fishing,hey let me know.LOL You just might talk me into getting out.LOL"
189222,misfish,2008-04-18 17:57:00,29133, Thats was a good one.
189226,misfish,2008-04-18 18:02:00,29133," Wayne,do you know what you could make turning that runway into a driving range?"
189232,Guest gbfisher,2008-04-18 18:24:00,0,"I dropped one,(golf) and stuck to just fishing. I can't explain WHY  How many reasons would you like to hear?  .  FOUR!!!!...Dam that was close. MAN.....are my feet ever wet. $200 to play? What do you mean no jeans? Sure I'll buy a pair of rain pants. "
189233,Fishnfiend,2008-04-18 18:27:00,357, Gerritt - you looking to give away the Big Bertha?  I have a set of Ping Irons and a crappy old driver... Wings and beer a fair trade?
189275,edmichit,2008-04-18 20:07:00,145,"keep me up to date on the Turkey sightings.....the fields in Innisfil have plenty. I stopped last night when i saw a flock to practice calling(ya i always keep the call in the car, just in case) The Toms are definately interested...now that the weather has changed."
189287,Gerritt,2008-04-18 21:08:00,6129,FNF pm me..  G
189292,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-18 21:30:00,1183,Awww leave him alone...golf is okay...peaceful...meet lots of snobs  haha...did the Doc not say to have more s e x...that's exercise...you need an exercise that gets your heart rate going faster...not sure that golf is it...nor is sitting in a boat...walk the shoreline and fish...do some house cleaning...walk the dog...get roller blades...do something that gets you huffing and puffing and wanting more...haha
189303,Gerritt,2008-04-18 22:16:00,6129,  makes perfect sense.... now to find a partner... tired of doing it myself  G
189304,misfish,2008-04-18 22:17:00,29133,It all depends whos on top.  I cant believe I just that.
189307,irishfield,2008-04-18 22:23:00,26272,"You should always be on top of your ""game"" Brian! Apparently it's what makes fishermen athletes!    I prefer it to be just a hobby though.. if you know what I mean..."
