189547,kickingfrog,2008-04-19 16:47:00,8333,"I posted this in another thread, but it needs one of it's own.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/sto...tional/Ontario/   Or posted below:   Ontario renews Nestlé permit to extract groundwater for sale MARTIN MITTELSTAEDT  From Friday's Globe and Mail  April 18, 2008 at 4:19 AM EDT  The Ontario Ministry of the Environment has renewed a controversial permit granting a unit of Nestlé Canada Inc. the right to continue extracting up to 3.6 million litres of groundwater a day near Guelph to sell as spring water.  The application for the permit by the food and beverage giant prompted thousands of letters of complaint to the government and has been a focal point of local opposition to the water bottling industry.  Environmentalists had been seeking to have the permit withdrawn, or scaled back, and objected to the government's practice of giving water away for free to those who have permits, including bottling companies that then sell the water they take.  While the ministry doesn't charge for actual water removals, it does levy modest cost-recovery fees to defray expenses for issuing and overseeing its permit system.  ""I'm disappointed that they did not reduce their volume, nor did they address the whole issue of giving a public resource away to a private enterprise for free,"" said Mark Goldberg, co-founder of Wellington Water Watchers, a local activist group.  The province levies a one-time $3,000 processing fee on complicated water permits that need a scientific evaluation. Beginning next year, it will charge an additional fee of $3.71 for every million litres permit holders withdraw, or $13.36 a day if Nestlé takes its full allotment.  ""The quantity is outrageous and the fees are ridiculously low,"" said Jode Roberts, a spokesman for Ecojustice, formerly the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, a legal adviser to Wellington Water Watchers, which has estimated that if Nestlé bought municipal water in Guelph it would pay about $2,700 a day.  The province released a statement yesterday saying it had issued the permit for a two-year period ""with strict conditions to protect existing water users and the natural environment.""  Nestlé said in a news release it was disappointed the province didn't agree to give it a five-year permit, as it had requested. Nestlé has owned the site, located in Aberfoyle, since 2000.  Although the ministry said studies show Nestlé's water extraction isn't affecting others in the area or local surface waters, it decided to grant only a two-year permit and is requiring the company to perform further monitoring to verify the finding of no harm to the local environment.  The company's pumping has exerted enough pressure to cause surface water in a creek near its site to be drawn underground, but Nestlé has maintained that the effect is of no consequence because it hasn't affected flow rates of the stream."
189548,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-19 16:54:00,33," Now this is where there could be potential problems with ""potable"" water.  All surface water nowadays is infected with the giardia and it doesn't matter where you go to take any water from any stream, be it high in the mountains or in the most sparcely populated places.  That kind of pressure for extracting water could cause contaminants to be leached from the said creek and/or from other ground pollution existing in the vicinity.  Has there been any scientific study on this, or are they waiting for people to start getting sick from drinking that brand of bottled water? I'm sure we'll all know soon enough."
189549,Maverick,2008-04-19 16:55:00,371,"This is ridiculous. ""No, of course extracting 3.6 million liters of water a day doesn't affect others in the area or local surface waters. I live in a make believe world where everything is soft and cushy. I pee beer!"" Give me a break!  It's all a bunch of Bull if you ask me. The government is just in it for the cash."
189565,Guest lundboy,2008-04-19 17:39:00,0,"  The government isn't making much money off of it considering how much Aberfoyle water Nestle sells worldwide. $3000 for a permit is pocket change off that.  The only other place the province would make money off it is on PST on each bottle sold.  We aren't the only ones getting screwed by Nestle, just look at the money they make off of water and the other towns affected:  http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/13063..._small_us_town/  Or this: http://www.greatlakesdirectory.org/wi/011204_great_lakes.htm  Or this: http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/20...e_wants_to.html  As if Nestle will be ""monitoring"" their affect on the water system.  They will just hire consultants (paid by them) to write reports the way they see fit.  Between Nestle and Vivendi,  our water resources are quickly becoming privatized.  They have even been contracted out around the world to run municipal water treatment facilities (privatized).  These companies are very dangerous, considering they are quickly gaining water ""rights"" around the world, and are world monopolies.  Yep soon, very soon... we are all going to see what the five food monopolies have in store for us, hint: you are already seeing it now at the grocery stores.  Nestle, Cargil, ConAgra, Monsanto, Vivendi, Kraft, Unilever.  You can't get away from them,  between them they control 90% of the food supply."

189594,bassfighter,2008-04-19 19:41:00,366,"Nestle has always been a controvertial company for years.  For years, They constantly tried to promote their powdered milk to the poorer third world country, where mom were not encourage to use their natural breast producing milk. Other indirect harm of using powered milk includes the use in unsanitized water when mixing the powdered milk. Babies are not getting the proper anti-bacterial agent or nutrients to combat disease.  We should be thankful that our tap water are considered the cleanest in the world, and yet everyone seemed to be to paranoid of bacteria or get the hang of drinking bottled water. Research shows that more kids are going to get cavities down the road due to drinking bottled water, which lacks Flouride."

189628,Guest lundboy,2008-04-19 21:51:00,0,"  This time I agree with you,  except everyone should do themselves a favour and buy a distiller, or a reverse osmosis system , or a Berkey gravity filter and use it on their tap water before they put in their Kleen Kanteen.  http://www.berkeywater.com/start.main.html  http://www.kleankanteen.com/  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23504373  http://www.fluoridealert.org/limeback.htm  http://www.reuters.com/article/pressReleas...8%2BPRN20080102  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2...aAYiE4gKd8-2wBA  I know, I know....  all a big conspiracy.  Nothing to it, all Bull.  OK  thats exactly what they said about Bisphenol A in plastics when people like me started spreading the word 6 years ago.  It's interesting that almost all bottled water contains fluoride at least .02 ppm.  Same with any juice from concentrate, pop/sodas because they are reconstituted with municipal water. (the first documented use of fluoride on humans was back during WWII by the Nazis just in case anyone wants to look it up)"

Know any stainless steel systems?  What have the Nazi's got to do with anything?: Nazi's worked with it so it must be bad?  Floride has its up and downs, its known.  forrest"

Cap this.....Cap that.........use this.......but not that.........but yeah, you can still take it, thats OK.  Things are gonna dry up pretty quick everywhere!"
189647,Guest lundboy,2008-04-19 22:44:00,0," Brita is not capable of removing fluoride, it even says: ""The Brita filter keeps a healthy level of fluoride, a water additive that promotes strong teeth""  Get a Berkey http://www.berkeywater.com/Big_Berkey.html , they come in stainless steel and are one of the best gravity filters you can get.  Make sure you order the fluoride cartridges as well http://www.berkeywater.com/Other_Products/PF_2.html .  Now as for the Nazis and fluoride,  they experimented on the prison camp inmates with it.  It was used to make them more docile.  ""The first occurrence of fluoridated drinking water on Earth was found in Germany's Nazi prison camps. The Gestapo had little concern about fluoride's supposed effect on children's teeth; their alleged reason for mass-medicating water with sodium fluoride was to sterilize humans and force the people in their concentration camps into calm submission. (Ref. book: ""The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben"" by Joseph Borkin.) ""  http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?l=1&t=0&id=17791  http://www.waterloowatch.com/Index_files/F...d%20Kidneys.pdf  I.G. Farben was so synonymous with Nazi death camp experimentation that it was broken up after the war to become Bayer & Agfa.  Sodium fluoride is also a key component of rat poisons and SSRI drugs such as Prozac and Zoloft (which are now also being found in tap water in high dosages).  It is almost impossible to avoid fluoride intake altogether,  but you can reduce it greatly by avoiding canned or bottled drinks and filtering your tap water.  Aren't I just a bundle of joy?"
