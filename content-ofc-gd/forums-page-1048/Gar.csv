He was thirsty, so he sauntered into the first establishment he encountered and asked the waiter for a glass of water.  ""Sorry"", said the waiter, ""we don't serve strings here.""  Discouraged, the string walked out.  A little further down the street, he met a stranger.  ""You look hot,"" said the stranger.  ""Why don't you go into that cafe and get a drink of water?""  ""I tried that,"" said the string, ""but the waiter wouldn't serve me anything because I'm just a string.""  ""No problem"" said the stranger.  ""I'll fix you up.""  He grabbed the string, tied him in a bowline and frayed his ends.  ""Now try it.""  The string slipped back into the cafe and asked the waiter for a glass of water.  ""Hey,"" said the waiter, ""aren't you the piece of string that was just in here?""  ""Nope,"" retorted the string, ""I'm a frayed knot."""
187718,capt bruce,2008-04-15 20:19:00,820,"Just for Doug  As a fisherman leaned over the edge of the boat to land his catch his wallet fell out of his shirt pocket. Before it could sink a large fish grabbed it. While he watched, openmouthed, another large fish grabbed it from the first, then another grabbed it from that one. His fishing buddy blandly commented, ""What's the matter? Haven't you ever heard of carp-to-carp walleting?   there was a man who sent ten different puns to friends, in the hope that at least one of the puns would make them laugh. Unfortunately, no pun in ten did."

187756,Sinker,2008-04-15 21:48:00,8692,"I've caught them using a treble hook, with a floating corky right above it. Put a nice sized minnow on the treble, and sight fish them. The corky will keep the minnow on the surface, and the gar will pounce on them. Wait a bit before you set the hook......and when you do, nail them hard.  I used to use a floating jighead with a minnow and a stinger hook, but I find a bare treble with a minnow is more effective.  Pretty awesome when they attack the minnow off the surface, but tough to get a hook into them.  Percy Reach and moira river were the waters I fished for them. I should go back there again and try for them......lots of fun.  Sinker"
187758,napjohn8,2008-04-15 21:54:00,46,"i caught one in the thames river by accident fishing for walleye. i caught a 3lb gar, they are stinky fish. I caught it on a spoon and the fight was good. If you want to catch them look for some guides in the thames river area and you may get lucky and get one who fishes for them."
189953,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-20 16:38:00,33," I concur with napjohn8 as well. I caught a 42""er by happenstance in the French River while fishing with a hook and minnow. The smell of that species has to be experienced to be described."

187668,wallyboss,2008-04-15 19:10:00,1095,"I think that if you use that nylon rope lure and it doesn't at least have one hook on it then it is not considered angling.  Angling – Angling means fishing with a line to which one to four hooks are attached and that is held in the hand or closely attended.  And it is illegal to take fish by any means other than angling, spear, bow and arrow, net or bait fish trap.   GENERAL PROHIBITIONS – IT IS ILLEGAL TO: • Fish for or possess the following specially protected fish species; American eel, cutlip minnow and redside dace. • Possess any of the following live invasive species: rudd, ruffe, bighead carp, black carp, grass carp, silver carp, round goby, tubenose goby or any member of the snakehead family. • Sell any angler-caught fish, crayfish, leeches, frogs, fish eggs or spawn, including angler-caught yellow perch taken from the waters of Lake St. Francis. Only holders of commercial fishing and commercial bait licences may sell their catch. • Possess a spring gaff, snagger, or spear gun for the purpose of fishing. No person shall take fish with a gaff or snare. A gaff may be used to assist in landing fish caught by lawful means. • Catch a fish by impaling or snagging it with a hook through any part of the body other than the mouth – any fish hooked in this way must be released immediately. • Take fish by any means other than angling, spear, bow and arrow, net or bait fish trap.  Not trying to ruffle feathers here but that is what I have been told about those nylon rope lures."
