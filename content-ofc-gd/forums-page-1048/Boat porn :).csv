189655,Gerritt,2008-04-19 23:08:00,6129,"Many of you have asked me to keep you updated on the progress with the boat both in threads and in PM's...  Your wish is my command...  you might remember this...    The partial rear floor going in...    Room for water run off and swelling...    another pic..    here is the second part of the back floor going in. I left a 6"" space so I have room for the bilge pump and plug... I did the floor in two pieces so I could easily remove the small back portion (removing 4 screws) to clean out any debris.. you might notice I had to seam the vinyl  I ran out... Ohhh well.. if it lifts (which it probably will) it will be easy to replace...      Here is a shot of the completed floor        Here is a shot of the GPS puck location    Fishfinder and GPS w/ Ram mounts        Here is her cover...      Now I only have to add the stereo and speakers tidy up a couple odds and ends...  And she is done...   For this year at least  I hope this post gave you a bit of insight in how to do your own boat floor... I went a bit overkill.... but I know I will not have issues in the future..  Thanks for looking.  G."

I also do not want the floor rubbing against the boat when underway or if the boat flexes   Thanks for all the comments guys!  G"
189774,maybe,2008-04-20 02:28:00,307,"Looks great!  One question, though - does this vinyl have some sort of surface treatment that keeps it from being slippy when wet?"
189777,Gerritt,2008-04-20 02:39:00,6129,  Sure does  it is textured  G
