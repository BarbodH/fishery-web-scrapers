187917,icefisherman,2008-04-16 02:01:00,952,"Well, after a loooong preparation the boat was on the water today at 2pm and did perform great. What a nice machine I've got, waooo... LOVE IT!!! All components and aftermarket equipment worked great, motors were solid. Got 55Mph top speed, plained in about 3 seconds And the kicker didn't burn any gas for the few hours of trolling. Steering arm, fuel filter, all worked fine.  And guess what...I even got some fish ha ha ha... The nice King was so impatient it didn't wait for me to put the rod in the rod holder after releasing my lead core and bammm fish on.... Later on the laker got hooked on the same rod/lure... Here are few pictures of the action today:  14 Lbs King.     11 Lbs Laker   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
