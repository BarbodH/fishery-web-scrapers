189650,GBW,2008-04-19 22:45:00,8460,Hey folks.  I need a battery for a Cuda 168 fishfinder.  This is not a portable unit but I want to be able to take it in and out of the small boat any time.  So I plan on checking the battery in a box in the boat to be removed when not in use.  Any ideas what I should get?  Oh and I'm not going to go with then over kill and bug $$ eaither...  thanks...

Smaller ones around $8.  I've bought batteries for my portable fishfinder, Aquavu and 2meg flashlight there.  About a quarter the price of anywhere else.  http://www.sayal.com/ActionContacts.asp"
