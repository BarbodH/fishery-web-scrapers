188925,irishfield,2008-04-18 01:52:00,26272,Bernie's got your answer.. you just have to find it. What ever rivet/screw/etc that is holding the outer bulb socket assembly together is not making ground. Your running lights are working by back feed thru the signal wire. Signal light won't work without a good ground. Fixed this exact problem on a BRAND NEW trailer for my f-in-laws pontoon boat trailer leaving Temagami Marine last August.  In that case found that they take a ground wire off the bulb socket.. run it out the housing and then have an eye ring on one of the bolts holding the lamp assembly to the trailer. They didn't even bare the steel.. leaving the lug touching the paint = no ground.  Put it back together and take a piece of wire.. ground it to the frame and touch the wire to the socket case.. watch the signal light flash..
188930,icefisherman,2008-04-18 01:56:00,952,"  Wayne, the left signal lite IS WORKING fine... The brake light is NOT working although they both use THE SAME YELLOW CABLE. This makes me think I have perfect ground....otherwise the signal light will not be working at all, right?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188933,Bernie,2008-04-18 02:00:00,3190,"Ha , had to wait for the pics to download. I made it to the cottage by boat tonight. Yep, run a wire from a good ground on the trailer to the metal base around the bulb and try it."
188934,icefisherman,2008-04-18 02:01:00,952,"I'll try it tomorrow guys, too exausted tonight. I'll try anything...hope something works.... Or I need someone who knows those things to see it in person.  Thanks for all your advice tonight.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188935,Bernie,2008-04-18 02:02:00,3190," No, read my reply on how it's getting ground. Its able to ground through the right side on signal but it cant when both are on . RUN THE WIRE! If I had a buck for everyone of these things I have fixed  I could........"
188936,irishfield,2008-04-18 02:02:00,26272,It's the ground on that socket base Emil. Signal I guess is working by backfeeding as well.. brakes don't have the flasher unit to let it.  Jumper a ground wire to the socket base and then go looking for how the unit is grounded to the frame after you see it works.
188960,sonny,2008-04-18 02:33:00,511,"Don't know if this helps but here ya go,,,i also had the same problem on my vehicle,,,it turns out i had a module on my truck that was part of the trailer connector wiring  i had plugged it into another trailer that was shorted and in turn it fried the module giving me the same problem you have!"
188971,Sinker,2008-04-18 02:51:00,8692,"I'm willing to bet the fix for this is a bad ground. I almost guarantee it.  I run a separate ground wire to all my lights on the trailers. Saves a lot of headaches.  Run a ground wire to that light, and I bet it works perfectly.  Sinker"
188980,icefisherman,2008-04-18 03:07:00,952,"Sinker,  from where to where exactly should I run that ground wire? What are the best locations on each side?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188983,irishfield,2008-04-18 03:11:00,26272,.
188984,Sinker,2008-04-18 03:13:00,8692,"I run mine right from the plug. A separate wire to one light......then a wire from there to the other light. This is a single wire I attach to the trailer with nylon wire clips. Saves me a lot of headaches......and its so easy to do. Use a decent sized wire too......can't be too big! Just make sure your ground in the plug, and on the truck is in good shape!! If that doesn't work, ground that wire to the truck frame and try again.........then you know the ground from your plug in is bad.  Sinker"
188993,Carp,2008-04-18 03:31:00,1488,"I was fed up with fooling around with trailer wires and fixing corrosion problems, so I bought a set of magnetic tow lights. Problem solved. I strongly recommend taping them onto the trailer frame or using plastic ties along with their magnetic capability to ensure a good bump in the road or flying debris don't knock them off. Both have happened to me. It takes about 3/4 minutes to put them on & take them off. Don't leave them on the trailer while you launch or your corrosion troubles will return. Good for other trailers too. When not in use, they can be store in the trunk/ cargo area. Keep them in some sort of container to protect them."
189341,icefisherman,2008-04-18 23:38:00,952,"Just to report - problem with my brake lights is solved and everything is working fine. It sure was the ground. For whatever reason the ground wire that comes from the plug to the back of the trailer is connected to one of the bolts that holds the tail light assembly....but the other bold holding the light assembly is the actually connected with white wire to the back of the bulb...soooo....the only way the ground goes from one bolt to the other is when they are tight to the frame of the trailer. But if paint/rust is in the way - there start the problems....anyhow...it is working now...hope for a long time./ Thanks again for the help guys.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
189344,Bernie,2008-04-18 23:53:00,3190,Glad it finally worked out for you! Grounds are the toughest. Had one one time with a tilt tongue. Drove me crazy till i figured it lost the ground at the pivot point.  :wallbash:  :wallbash:
189346,Dondorfish,2008-04-19 00:05:00,1000,Glad all is well Emil - Now go catch some fish!!!!   Don  
189375,Sinker,2008-04-19 00:59:00,8692,Told you it was a ground   It almost alway is!  Glad ya got her working.......where you fishing tomorrow?  Sinker
189381,Terry,2008-04-19 01:12:00,14456,yup..almost always ground..................next
189382,irishfield,2008-04-19 01:13:00,26272,I even told you which wire and how... lol
189408,Bernie,2008-04-19 02:00:00,3190,Who said it first?  Terry wins!!!!
189412,irishfield,2008-04-19 02:04:00,26272,
189421,icefisherman,2008-04-19 02:28:00,952,"Ha ha ha guys you are amazing ;-) LOL Relax time tomorrow, but going after the big boys on Sunday on the South side. Maybe I'll see some of you on the water?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
189457,brickNblock,2008-04-19 08:34:00,598,Lol....I love happy endings.  Today I was going to be doing just this myself.....now I knows what to look out for. I thankya'll too!
188864,icefisherman,2008-04-18 00:17:00,952,"I've discovered last night one(left) brake light on my trailer doesn't work. The right one is working fine. All the other lights - running, turn signal are working fine also. Bulb is fine, I've changed the right with the left bulb - same problem.  My trailer is from the US and has not 4 but 6 wires coming out of the plug - 3 to the right (green, brown, white) and three to the left (yellow, brown, white).  It seems the yellow wire on the left carries the turn signal AND (?!?) the brake signal. My neighbor came look at it could not figure it out and he is playing with cars for hobby and know somewhat about wiring. My other neighbor came, he is electrician, also could not figure it out.  It doesn't make much sense that one brake light is working and the other is not and the bulb is OK. Can anyone come up with solution how to resolve this? Don't want to replace all the wiring again. Just did it on my old boat trailer before selling it last year. I'd like to avoid the exercise if I could.  Thank you.   Chers, Ice Fisherman"
188869,Snowball,2008-04-18 00:24:00,167,"Here is a URL to some wiring diagrams that may help you out:  http://www.etrailer.com/faq_wiring.aspx  Regards, Snowball"
188871,Terry,2008-04-18 00:25:00,14456,white is ground yellow is left stop and turn brown is right stop and turn green is tail lights  if it is not bulb or connection problems then it has to be ground
188873,Dondorfish,2008-04-18 00:30:00,1000,  My guess is that Terry is correct. Sounds like a ground problem on the individual light. Remove the light and clean up the connection where the light is grounded to the trailer. - just my 2 cents.   Don  
188882,icefisherman,2008-04-18 00:47:00,952,"Terry sure is correct on what color is what. But now.....if it is ground problem....why would the right brake light working and the left does not? And also....same bulb also serves as running light and turn signal - both those are working fine....so how come the same left ball works fine when turn signal and the running lights are on but doesn't work when I press the brake pedal?!?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188884,Gerritt,2008-04-18 00:48:00,6129,I know I had the same issue. I was pulling my hair out as the trailer was brand new... turns out it was the plug on my truck that was the culprit.. on of the wires had some of the insulation missing.... yup corroded  to the point that it broke..   Just pointing this out as the trailer is not always the issue..  G
188885,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-18 00:52:00,835,"brown is on both sides makes it tail lights, doesn't it?"
188886,Big Cliff,2008-04-18 00:52:00,6899,"Well, if you are close to Lindsay and want to bring it over I can fix it for you."
188887,Bernie,2008-04-18 00:52:00,3190,Brown is tail lights. Green is right turn and stop. Yellow is left turn and stop. Some of the newer pickup trucks have separate fuses for trailer lights. Verify your vehicle trailer power output first. Then verify ground is working and is grounding to trailer. this step a lot of guys miss and it can really mess you up.
188888,wallyboss,2008-04-18 00:53:00,1095,A bad ground can make a grown man cry.  I would say that 95% of light issues on trailers are bad grounds.  If there is a problem that nobody can figure out it will turn out to be a bad ground somewhere.
188889,icefisherman,2008-04-18 00:54:00,952,"  Appreciate your kind offer Clif but I am in Georgetown. May have to use the service of someone who knows those things very well though and is close to me as I don't know what else I can do to fix it....spent two days ask three other people.....nothing....    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188892,Terry,2008-04-18 00:56:00,14456,"sometimes to find a ground it will back feed thought the other light, so one will work and one will not or sometimes the second one will be really dim  so test,  run a wire from ground on the truck to ground on the light that's not working  you might need to sand the metal to get a good connection"
188893,Gerritt,2008-04-18 00:57:00,6129,Should be fairly simple if you have a volt metre.. apply voltage to the various pins on the trailers plug...  attach volt metre to the light in question.. this should give you an answer as to what wire had the issue  volt metre can be had cheap... I am sure your electrician friend has one....  remove the bulbs however..  Dont see why this wont work...  G
188894,icefisherman,2008-04-18 00:59:00,952," Precisely Bernie....and since the left side is the problem one, the yellow wire is the one in question as it does turn and stop for the elft. The strange thing is, the turn works fine(while using the SAME yellow wire), and both bulb elements inside the bulb work fine when turn signal or running lights are on.......just that for some reason pushing the brake pedal does NOT send electric signal to the bulb....the same bulb that works otherwise with turn signal and running lights, over the same Yellow wire that carries fine the turn signal but does not want to carry the brake signal..........drives me CREASYYYYYYYY!!!!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188896,icefisherman,2008-04-18 01:01:00,952,"  But Terry, if the grouns is the problem, why do the running light and turn signal on the SAME LEFT side work fine?  Gerrit, my electrician friend spent 1 hour this afternnon with the volt meter in hand and couldn't figure it out....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188898,Bernie,2008-04-18 01:03:00,3190,So is there a brake light signal coming out of the truck? Your problem may lie there. Still a possible fuse. What kind of vehicle?
188900,muskymike,2008-04-18 01:04:00,772," I am in the same boat as G  I rewired the trailer 2 weeks ago, turns out it was a wire on my harness on the truck side.  look at that before you ""start to look like G"""
188903,icefisherman,2008-04-18 01:12:00,952," Nissan Pathfinder. Brake signal is fine out of the truck, fine on the right side as well.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188905,Bernie,2008-04-18 01:18:00,3190,Check to verify the left signal housing is grounded. I think you will find your problem there. Cant think of any other possibility. To check run a wire from the trailer ground to the ground around the bulb. That is if it is an 1157 style bulb. If it isnt try to trace the ground path and touch the wire to it at the bulb.
188908,Terry,2008-04-18 01:20:00,14456,do nissans run a different wiring system then American built trucks....seems I remember installing an adapter to make a nissan work with a regular wiring harness but that was many years ago
188909,Dondorfish,2008-04-18 01:27:00,1000,May sound stupid - but have you tried cleaning the contact inside the bulb socket - could be corroded. If clean - take a 12 volt tester ( the one with the light ) and have someone step on the breaks - light should come on. If no power at the contact - check the wire outside the socket to see if there is power there. Trace it back till you find power and that should be where the problem lies. I have had wires in the past with a break inside the wire and no visible sign of damage.  Don  
188910,Bernie,2008-04-18 01:27:00,3190,"Terry, I assumed he already had that done if it was necessary. Seeing as he does have output at the truck technically it should work the trailer if trailer is working correct. The signal works therefore it proves the left power circuit. When applying brake it therefore cannot get ground through the opposite filament. Hence the thought on bad ground at the tailight itself."
188916,icefisherman,2008-04-18 01:33:00,952,"Guys do you want me to go and take pictures of the left plastic plate holding all the wires/bulbs at the back of the trailer? If it helps you I can post the picture.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
188917,Bernie,2008-04-18 01:35:00,3190,"Ya, sure if you can. Still almost convinced its a bad ground."
188922,icefisherman,2008-04-18 01:47:00,952,"OK hope this helps:  This is the trailer connector.   Here is the plastic insert/plate holding all the bulb/wires: This is the left side       Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
