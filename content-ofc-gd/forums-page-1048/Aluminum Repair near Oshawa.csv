Unfortunately, the boat had gotten away from the prior owner and was banging into rocks for awhile.  The damage is on the splash rail at the transition between the side and bottom of the boat.  It was repaired from the outside by bending aluminum plate around it, and rivetting it to the splash rail.  It was done quite well, but the rivets they used are hollow, and were covered in some kind of silicon, which does leak.  I have completely torn out the interior of the boat, and would like to have it repaired from the inside as well.  Any suggestions who to deal with in the area?"
