190034,Gerritt,2008-04-20 21:38:00,6129,This might sound like a silly question...  But today I wired the Fishfinder to the fuse block and hooked it up to the transducer..  right now the boat is located on its trailer on a paved driveway...  I turned it on and it was reading that I was in 6' - 10' of water...  Is this normal for it to be giving a depth reading when out of the water???  The unit is a Eagle 500c  G
190035,irishfield,2008-04-20 21:38:00,26272,Yes... it's about four x the distance to the floor!  (mine was showin 9.1 feet 20 minutes ago.. LOL)
190036,Sinker,2008-04-20 21:43:00,8692,"I thought it wasn't such a good idea to run them out of water? Just a myth?  I try to keep mine off out of water, but yesterday, I put it on the trailer and realized it was still turned on......LOL.......gotta get the boat system back down to a science again. I'm still in icefishing mode I think.  Mine doesn't show a depth though......just flashes 0.0  Sinker"
190038,irishfield,2008-04-20 21:45:00,26272,They will heat up if you run them for a long time. Mine was reflecting off a nice smooth cement floor. Wanted to see if the new speed sensor I hooked up worked and to get GBay up on my screen before the am launch !
190040,kickingfrog,2008-04-20 21:49:00,8333,You're asking this board about normal????  Did you forget your hat today?

190063,danc,2008-04-20 23:05:00,4677,  Did you mark any fish??
190064,irishfield,2008-04-20 23:07:00,26272,Doubtful Dan.. G's got a Lowrance/Eagle... not a Humminbird with Fish ID.
190070,Greencoachdog,2008-04-20 23:20:00,8163,  No simulation on a Lowrance/Eagle???... that sucks!!!... I mark some of my best fish in simulation mode!
