189446,smokinall4s,2008-04-19 05:44:00,89,seeing those smiles on the kids after catching the fish makes everything seem less important at the time. It looks like you two had a blast and those catfish are pretty big. Nice pics and keep up the great fishing.
189448,sonny,2008-04-19 05:50:00,511,"All i can say is that i can't thank you enough...although i didn't actually catch any myself there is not a better feeling then watching my son catch fish and enjoy it!!  I still have memories of my father and myself fishing when i was a child...and i hope this is one of those memories for my son,,,with many more to come,,,thank you steve as my son thanks you with his smile!!!"

I bought my 4 year old niece a ""Dora the Explorer"" fishing rod last year and that is pretty much all she talks about...  ""Papa, when are you and uncle Bill going to take me fishing again?""  Can't beat it."
