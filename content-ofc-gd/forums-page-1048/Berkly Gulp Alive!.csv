189510,Abberz,2008-04-19 14:30:00,140,I've tip'd a white or black jig head the same you would do with a real leech. I can see them working on a walleye (pickeral) rig as well.
189514,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-19 14:55:00,3761,What about for bass.
189521,BillM,2008-04-19 15:22:00,17367,"You could do all kinds of things.  Rig is as a swimbait, dropshot it...  Whatever you want really.. It's pretty versatile."
189550,OhioFisherman,2008-04-19 16:56:00,6623,"I have never used them, just looked at the picture from Berkley`s website. Just from looking at it as a trailer on a bass style jig, as a trailer on a spinner bait, on a ball or mushroom(worm nosed) jig, like mentioned drop shot rig, hooked thru the nose and cast weightless thru weeds or lilies.  Just depends on what you want to try."
189564,tip-up,2008-04-19 17:38:00,94,I bought two pails of the stuff to give a go this season for drop-shot'n..Not the leech but both patterns of shiner. I am new to the baits as well and have only heard great things about it!
