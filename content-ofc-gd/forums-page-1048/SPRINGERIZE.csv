189475,cranks bait,2008-04-19 11:23:00,721,"Had my boat out over three weeks ago.  Just after the ice out.  Really cool to be floating around between ice burgs still coming though.  I surprised myself because I did nothing to winterize my boat.  About an ounce of Stabil in the tank, that was it.  Started up on the first turn of the key.  Then again it is an Evinrude.  My trailer on the other hand.  It has another boat on it still.  I know the bulbs need replacing (bad habit of leaving the lights pluged in and going in the water).  Should repack the bearings, check the tongue, and maybe make it into a bunk.  Or just sell it and get a new one?"
