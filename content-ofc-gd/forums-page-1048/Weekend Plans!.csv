189734,Rich Clemens,2008-04-20 00:58:00,3131,"Well today worked out very nicely.  Did a number of the week-end chores last night.   Since my better half likes to sleep in on Saturday, I pulled the boat out of the garage and spent some time getting everything ready to go.   Updated the Lowrance software and installed my new Navionics Canada chip - pretty impressive and anxious to give it a try.   Engine fired right up on the first try.   Mowed the yard for the first time ... now that will be a regular job now until late October.  Few honey-do items and spent part of the afternoon reorganizing the tackle box and sharpening the hooks.   Even may a little room for a few more lures.   Got my eyes on ordering a couple Double Cowgirls to add the the collection of lures that don't seem to catch anything.  Oh well .. what's a couple more.     Couple months yet to my first musky trip of this year.   I have a good feeling about this year.  My neighbor is retired and loves to go fishing, so we spent some time this evening talking about fishing and places to go.  One of these Saturdays ... we're outta here for a day."
189745,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-20 01:14:00,1183,"Welll....I am sitting here...kinda sorta...as my whole body is aching....I challenged myself and painted the ceiling in my living room, dining room, and kitchen...and I completely made a mess...but I don't care...just another touch of me  haha  Tonight, I filled in nail holes..tomorrow it's sanding, then priming, then painting the walls in the living room and dining room only for now...honestly...I took on more than I can chew....and anyone who can have a steady hand to ""cut"" should be a surgeon!!  Short people should not paint."
189831,holdfast,2008-04-20 05:25:00,1813,Storm Coming.  Was at my trailer in Big River but decided to head her back today vice tomorrow.  Looks like this is going to hurt.  To Bad because almost all the snow was gone.  Oh well got to see my Habs blow it.  But I knew they would.

188897,LundGuy,2008-04-18 01:02:00,169,"First got to clean up my property, as long as it doesn't rain, which is what they are calling for in this region. My son is redoing one of the bedrooms while I get all the motors out and get them running and warmed up. Will be rigging the boats up for the up coming season. Then on Sunday will be getting all the fishing gear ready, relining reels and resorting lures etc. Then crashing for the night!  Now if it rains, only the gear work will be getting done."

I might even get to rake my yard sometime saturday............have a bonfire with the kids saturday night, roast some marshmallows and make some smores. Should be great......the wife is gone all weekend......yeehaw!!  Sinker"

189122,fishnsled,2008-04-18 14:32:00,3520,Looks like I'll be getting the birds out of my soffits.  When the house was built they left a gap of a couple of inches between the top of the facia board and the roof board in some areas.  It hasn't been a problem in the past as the shingles curled over into the eaves blocking the holes that I had no idea of.  Last fall I had the roof re-shingled and this exposed to opening.  Roofer failed to tell me of this problem   and now I'm the Holiday Inn for some starlings and sparrows.    Well after tomorrow the holiday will be over.     Hopefully I'll have some time to get the boat cleaned up as well.  Sunday I just might have to take out a mortage for some gas   and make my way to he lake.  If not fishing I may finish off the yard work and a couple of other projects I've got on the go.
189200,edmichit,2008-04-18 16:59:00,145,"Well if all goes as planned (hey sometimes it happens!)  Saturday, my son is taking the Hunters Education course....looking forward to taking him Turkey hunting on his 14th bday 1st w/e of May.

I usually make it out 2 weekends a year.  This year i'm going out on the 26th and also the weekend of the 10th.  My problem with turkey hunting is its too easy to fall asleep with that warm breeze.
