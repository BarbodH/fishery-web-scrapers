378061,Paully,2009-08-30 15:58:00,712,Thats the Big river.....
378065,StoneFly,2009-08-30 16:14:00,574,Looks Like Niagara
378117,Roy,2009-08-30 18:58:00,13728,"It might be the ""mysterious first post"" river. There's bass so it's not in Japan. One down, 192 countries to go."
378120,Syn,2009-08-30 19:14:00,519,Must be near L.A.  
378173,bigfish1965,2009-08-30 21:31:00,3382,Lower Niagara River just  down from the whirlpool. I know the exact rock...great bass/salmon/trout spot.
378176,highdrifter,2009-08-30 21:38:00,2534, Lotsa bass in Japan dude!
378177,Gerritt,2009-08-30 21:42:00,6129,Mmmmm... fresh quivering Bass and Wasabi! YUM!!!!  G
378221,StoneFly,2009-08-30 23:20:00,574,is this the spot?  sorta?   
378226,Cudz,2009-08-30 23:29:00,2652,I would have said that it was niagara but those smallies look way too small for the river.  Maybe you were using them as bait.  THat must be it.
378228,Billy Bob,2009-08-30 23:33:00,5865,I not sure of the fishing spot but I think I know who the duffass is holding the dinky bass.
378295,BillM,2009-08-31 01:18:00,17367,China.
378312,wuchikubo,2009-08-31 01:52:00,1114," HD is correct, there is definitely bass in Japan. Fished Biwa Lake and it had black bass (not too sure if there is any difference between them and the largies here)."
378319,Weeds,2009-08-31 02:14:00,782,I'm pretty sure that's Taylor Creek at the bottom of Dawes Road. Just take the number 23 bus from Main Station.
378324,jaydub,2009-08-31 02:26:00,145," I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that the new world record 24.??lb largemouth was just caught in Japan a month or so ago.  Didn't count as the official new record though cuz it only beat the previous one by .2oz or something."
378346,TC1OZ,2009-08-31 03:37:00,987,I think I'll be hitting up the Niagara River for some big ole bass!
378395,ricoboxing,2009-08-31 12:35:00,398,"by the look of the guy, thats the corner of church and wellesley.     looks like the lower niagara river to me"
