378361,bigfish1965,2009-08-31 06:02:00,3382," When he is onto the bass and cats, he is second to none..likely more pics than anyone other than Wayne. Dawg invented the term 'fish porn'. Of course he takes it to an uncomfortable level, but we love the ol redneck anyway. I know you havent met the man, Dr. Trust me when I say you won't meet a better guy. Total Alabama redneck and salt of the earth."
