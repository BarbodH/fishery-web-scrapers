378381,fisher,2009-08-31 11:54:00,451,I have one for sale in the classified section...actually my dad is selling it but I am helping advertize.  It is on a 2009 Chevy Silverado - 8 foot box.  And it is only 3 weeks old.  He decided to go with the truck cap now and is selling the cover for much less than he paid.  Asking $450 when he just paid $630+ for it.  Call me if interested....905-893-4186
