377791,Mike the Pike,2009-08-29 17:27:00,3421,Well after a decade of  snoring I finally went to see a specialist for my severe case of snoring.  My snoring was so loud my daughters would come downstairs into my room in the middle of the night and yell at me to stop or turn on my side.  Luckily for me the wife sleeps like a log.On some past camping trips these last few years one daughter decided to leave the comforts of our tent trailer for the silence of our van.My eldest daughter has her own tent and refuses to sleep with her parents in the trailer. My snoring got so bad that when I would  on my various fishing trips many of my buddies refused to bunk up in the same room as me.  Well finally my GP gave me a name of a specialist and I chose Lazer surgery to remove my Uvila and to open up my airway.  My question is has anyone else had this done and how was your outcome.How long did it take to recover.  I was rather surprised Thursday afternoon about how many prescriptions my doctor filled out for pain.  Well I am in extreme pain and my diet is mostly Jello and Cup a Soup.  I had no idea I would be this soar.Drinking water is severe torcher. I am using those pain killers thats for sure.  I tought I would be taking my son fishing this weekend and I know that is not going to happen. I feel like a Zombie and can't wait to recover.The positive outcome is I am losing weight very quickly.  So if you have had the procedure done let me know how it went.  So far I do find an improvment in my breathing but I am still very swollen to see the full results. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MTP               MTP
377822,SlowPoke,2009-08-29 19:38:00,2984,"On behalf of myself and the rest of the November Quinte crowd, thank you. Good luck with recovery Mike. I think ice cream and cold beer will ease the pain."
377830,Greencoachdog,2009-08-29 20:31:00,8163,Did you have a bad taste in your mouth when you woke up from the surgery Mike?  A buddy of mine had that same procedure done and said when he woke up from the surgery he noticed a rag on the table with feces on it... he asked the what it was and she said the surgeon didn't have enough light to see what he was doing so they shoved a light up his rectum and threaded it all the way up into his throat!  It took a couple weeks to recover from the surgery.. dunno if he'll ever recover from the light deal though!
377832,Bernie,2009-08-29 20:41:00,3190,Ha... Good way to make him feel better Glen.  Hope you recover quickly Mike.
377850,SlowPoke,2009-08-29 21:49:00,2984, That rarely happens in Canada due to government regulated health care.
377855,TC1OZ,2009-08-29 22:13:00,987,"I snore really bad when I am drunk, but the wife usually sleeps in the guest room! hahaha."
377868,Mike the Pike,2009-08-29 23:57:00,3421," Your Buddy should come to canada we have much nicer Doctors not to mention I was awake for the entire procedure.  Here is a pic of my Surgeon.    I must admit dog you made me laugh but it hurt like hell.I can't wait stop taking thse pain killers.  In the last 2 days I have only eaten,0ne Mr.Freeze,One small rice pudding ,one bowl of Jello ,One cup a Soup and tonights gourmet meal a bowl of ice cream.  I can't wait to eat steak again.  MTP"
377890,Leecher,2009-08-30 01:21:00,7832, Mike.... can I get your surgeons phone number Hope you get well soon!!! Jacques
377894,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-30 01:29:00,2038,"  She won't be answering her phone tomorrow .......,her and I are heading out to Lake XXX..."
377924,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-30 02:51:00,947,Is this Covered by OHIP?
378294,Mike the Pike,2009-08-31 01:17:00,3421," Unfortuantely Henry it is not covered by Quebec medicare.I am hoping it will be covered some what by private insurance but I don't think it will be.  It costs $1000.00 well worth it if the operation is successful as snoring is not good for ones health.  Right now I am in extreme pain it looks like I am not going to work in the morning.  I have been eating lots of Mr,Freeze cold soup ,pudding and Jello and lots of pain Killers.  Sure would like to hear from someone who had the procedure done.  MTP"
378297,BillM,2009-08-31 01:21:00,17367,"Cauterizing is what they most likely did.  Best way to do it with minimal bleeding, but man they are pretty much burning it off!!!  Had my tonsils done when I was 19 via the same method...  Hurt like hell and I couldn't eat much for atleast a week..  Hurt to swallow also, I spit for the first couple of days..  Get better soon!"
378339,fishnsled,2009-08-31 02:57:00,3520,"I won't tell you what I had for dinner......ooooooh alright, BBQ sausage, BBQ chicken and yes BBQ steak.  Potatoe salad and coleslaw as well.  It won't be long and you'll be back to you're old self minus the snoring.  All the best for a speedy recovery Mike."
378420,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-31 14:04:00,1022,"I snore myself, and people also refuse to sleep in the same tent/room as me. I use breath right strips, and it works really well, but they are very pricey. I'm sure it will only get worse as I age though as I'm only 24 now. Quiting/slowing down on smoking helped though big time. Might have to consider this surgery myself. Is there any disadvantages of having this done? How long is expected recovery time?  On a side note: I have a buddy who's dad snores so loud that he can hear him snoring when he walks up to the door (and the door is closed). Very advantageous when he used to come home drunk in his high school days..... He would listen for the snore and if he heard it, he knew it was safe to proceed."
378530,Bly,2009-08-31 19:45:00,1556,"Mike, hope you feel better soon.  Recovering from any procedure is rough but always seems worse when it last longer or is worse than they say.  Don't know anyone that has had this particular procedure, sorry.  A friend had some nasal work done to help with snoring/sleep apnea and did say that even though it was awful she felt so much better after  (more rested etc..) that she would do it again if she had to.   Hope this helps a little.  Take care Mike and hope to hear you are up and around again very soon!"
