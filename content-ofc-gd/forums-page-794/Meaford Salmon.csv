378459,cmelnyk2,2009-08-31 16:28:00,8,"Well folks,  Holidays kick in this week, and I will be on the water tonight in Meaford for there annual week long Salmon Derby.  It started on Saturday and the weekend was crap with a strong east wind Saturday which is horrible for Meaford and a Strong North wind yesterday, but at least we could get out.  The 17.5 ft bow rider handled the 3 to 5 foot swells quite well might I add.  By 9:30 am, the only boats around were mine and the 2 charther boats which are both over 28feet.  Just before heading in we lost a real heavy fish.  It was on for a few minutes before spitting it. Grrrrr.......  Anywho, just thought I would let that out before asking if anyone here been fishing off Meaford and had any luck?  I will update later in week or next Tueasday.  Cheers Chris"
