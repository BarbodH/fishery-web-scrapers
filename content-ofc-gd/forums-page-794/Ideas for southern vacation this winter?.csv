I've been poking around the internet looking for Caribbean deals and the prices are a bit shocking.  The travel section for the Toronto Star has some good deals, but it's all for trips in Oct-Nov-Dec.  We're looking for the mid-winter.  We're not looking for over-crowded, high-rise beach front 5-star resorts.  We are looking for somewhere nice, clean, quiet, and relaxing.  I was thinking maybe some people here might have some suggestions that might fit the bill, from personal experience.  Thanks!"

It may be a little cooler than you'd like but they do have some real nice days in January and February.  It will be inexpensive as well!  The saltwater fishing is great for big Bull Redfish at that time of year too!!!"
