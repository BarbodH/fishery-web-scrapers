378121,rob v,2009-08-30 19:15:00,535,We're planning a trip to the area in the coming week and I was wondering if anyone was aware of the current water conditions in the area.  Is the river water level higher or lower than normal right now ?  We're trying to get an idea of water issues if any we're going to have getting into the back country  If anyone has any info it would be appreciated.  thanks.
