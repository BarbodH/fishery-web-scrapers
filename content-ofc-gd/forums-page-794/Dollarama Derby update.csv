East wind is the worse wind by far for KBay.  ANyway, it was windy but the T-showers never came. Monday is the last fishing day for the Dollarama Tourney and pics should be posted by Tuesday Sept 1st. I will be fishing quite a bit monday to try and win this thing but it might be a tough one. Please attach all photos of caught fish onto the Dollarama sticky thread at top of Discussion thread. Good luck."

I had good intentions of winning this thing on Monday but when I went to get my stuff on Friday they told me all the fishing gear's been replaced by Haloween stuff...go figure, it is still August as far as I know.  P.S.  Good news for you though Cudz...now you still have a chance! LOL"
