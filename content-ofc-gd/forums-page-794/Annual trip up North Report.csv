Good eats, drinks, laughs and the odd fish  ....my buddy and I even got to portage into another lake this trip for some eyes....  We had great weather other than the Tuesday that bombarded us with a wicked West wind that kept us on the island with nothing much to do other than drink many pops and cocktails  ....it's amazing how us older guys can still keep up with the young bloods...  Here's some pics of our trip....    My son-in-law was determined to catch something off the dock....        The end of the bay where we started our portage...    My buddy Steve who's like a strong pack mule...    Our destination...          Some more shots from the main Lake.....        My son and son-in-law chillin' out with a couple of beers enjoying the scenery    My son-in-law with his first Laker....    Our home away from home for the week....    A beautiful Northern sunset and my new Lowrance HDS-5 which is amazing!!!!!....  "

377838,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-29 21:23:00,1362, Never used the downriggers and the wind wouldn't let up to vertical jig....steel line and lead core was the winning combination...

378101,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-30 18:09:00,1362," Thanks Joey....I didn't mind the jackets as much as the friggin' wierd wind.....one minute from the west, then south, then north.....I prefer cooler temps as there were minimal mosquitoes...    Thanks Kevin....you should come up with me next year!!....you would fall in love with this lake and there are huge smallies but I don't fish them!!"

378140,Greencoachdog,2009-08-30 20:10:00,8163,"Excellent report, pics, and fish Steve!!!  Amazing to be able to see the rocks on the bottom when it's that windy, most lakes would be muddy.  That Georgia boy looks a little colder than the rest of y'all... I have the same problem when I travel to the Great White North too!"
378156,Badger Shark,2009-08-30 20:55:00,291,"Nice report Steve, looks like a great place to fish.  Wish I could go up there some time. How has the rest of the summer been going?  I havent been up to the bay this year but once."
378240,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-30 23:59:00,1362,"   Hey Don,  The summer (WHAT SUMMER??????) has been hectic between work and getting things done around the house...I stripped and stained the entire cedar posts and rails around the deck this year which took forever using a 4 1/2"" hand grinder....  I'm sure we'll get together soon between fishing Quinte for eyes or here for the Muskies till ice up..."
