378336,fishnsled,2009-08-31 02:47:00,3520,Great report Joey. Love the pics.  And here I thought the video of Paul's new ride would be him zipping up and down the lake in that fancy Lund.  I never would have thought he could have improved upon that but some how he did.
378340,sturgman,2009-08-31 02:59:00,249,Thank you for the awesome pictures.. Great trip!!

378551,Bly,2009-08-31 20:28:00,1556,Great report and pictures Joey...love Paul's new ride.    thanks!
377910,Joey,2009-08-30 02:29:00,9122,"Paul and I decided to head up to Lakair again, camping this time, and stayed for a week.  We were to head to Wayne and Leah's on Wednesday, but got the unfortunate news of Wayne's mother's passing.  We are both so very sorry for your loss Wayne.  So we just camped the week out instead and I'll admit, I've had better camping weather (but I've also had worse).  Here is home for the week.  Our old tent tanked last time (the zipper broke and it got a hole in it) so we got this new one, which I was very impressed with.    Paul set up his new Shrek lantern    The pike were active some days, not so much others, but we did catch pike every day.  It was hot front/cold front, west wind/east wnd, all combined in the same day most day.  Very hard to deal with.    I thought this was a weird sight.    Until I realized why it was there.  I looked for this bald eagle and his mate all over the lake this week trying to get the perfect shot.    A teeny, tiny pickerel.     The moon.     We took Toby the dock hand and Sabrina out for the day.    Got a cool shot of a woodpecker ready to eat a bug.    And her mate.     Camp cat all comfy on a boat.    This pickerel is a little bigger.  Came in at 26 inches and just over 5 lbs.    Paul got a decent one too, in the slot tho.    Now for some fun and games.  Toby discovered a wasp's nest had fallen out of a tree by the big wind we had up there and Leslie decided to take care of things.    Didn't your mother ever teach you not to poke a sleeping bear    I even took a video.    One of the warmer nights.    Another pike.    The eagle and his mate.      It was somewhere around here Paul got bored and decided to have some fun.  This one's for you Beans     I caught this pike with some weird marks on it.  Bite marks maybe?    A sunset    Great moonlit night.    A couple more tries at the eagle shot.  Its not easy on zoom with a moving boat in the waves let me tell you.       More pike.    Paul with the largest of the week.  36 inches.    We keep seeing alot more of these guys up there.  This rock never used to have them on it, only seagulls.  Now the seagulls were hard pressed to find a spot.      The snake that lives in the rock crack that drives Digger batty.    So at the start of the week the wind pushed all the water westward down the lake, then later in the week it pushed it all back eastward.  Notice the difference in the dock to water ratio.  Actually, this morning was a torrential downpour with a wicked lightening storm (as we packed up   ) and very high winds.  Kevin had to go rescue some campers from an island who took two of his boats there to camp and one sunk in the high winds that rose the water levels this morning.          Overall it was a nice time.  We did raise two muskies, but they would not commit.  Thanks for having us again Kevin & Leslie.  Joey"
