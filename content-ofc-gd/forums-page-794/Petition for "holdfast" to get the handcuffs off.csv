I for one have not seen Holdfast acting out or being belligerent or a bully of any sort on this board. (unlike one or two others that seem to ).  If anyone else is in support of getting these handcuffs taken off one of the GREAT STORY TELLERS on this board... please add your name to this thread in support of this action.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Splashhopper   PS.. Holdfast is not behind this, and I sure hope the moderators take this thread in the spirit it is intended.    "

When you need information about these kinds of things, PM one of the mods. These threads make things worse. I'm going to lock this because it's not helping anything and  you'll have your answer very soon."
