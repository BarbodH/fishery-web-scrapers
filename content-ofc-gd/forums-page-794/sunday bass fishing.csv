We got to the pond around 11 and i knew we were going to catch some bass over cast with light rain! well i knew for sure to have a buzzbait on and a spinnerbait! we worked the whole shoreline pretty good that was until my electric motor drive pin decided to bust LOL   I wasint going to let that ruin my day so we had to paddle and anchor to falling trees and logs where all the bass came out of.  Almost every piece of structure in that pond we caught fish! Its been 2 years since ive hit up this pond and its still on one of my top list of fav's and im sure is now one of robs fav ponds to fish. I had a great time and cant wait to do it again thanks for coming out rob           "
