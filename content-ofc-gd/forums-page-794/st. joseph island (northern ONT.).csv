378679,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-01 01:44:00,0,there might be somewhere to launch right at the bridge.  i know people fish for eyes. under/downstream of the bridge...bring some real heavy bells sinkers and 3 way swivels though...
378683,redneck666,2009-09-01 01:48:00,563,bells sinkers?  what are the 3 ways for? lol i was plannin on usin harnesses and crank bait and jigs.
378685,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-01 01:50:00,0,i just meant if you fished near the bridge.  the current is real heavy right at the bridge...harnesses/cranks don't get down very deep because of the high current
378688,redneck666,2009-09-01 01:51:00,563,"ohhh lol bell sinkers, i'll have to buy some heavier ones.... still, about the 3 ways...?"
378689,redneck666,2009-09-01 01:52:00,563,"okay, uhh, what would you rig onto the swivels?"
378697,Dara,2009-09-01 02:19:00,3052,"Tie your line to one eye of the 3 way. Tie a hook on about 1 metre of line to another eye of the 3 way. Tie the bell sinker with about 30 cm of line to the last eye. Just a worm on the hook so it is stretched out. Bounce the sinker on bottom under the bridge. You gotta have a stMarys river anchor to anchor there or you will likely be leaving it stuck in the rocks. If you have a little boat that you can lift, you can put it in at that little park right at the bridge, otherwise, if you have to launch, its $5 at Richards landing marina. If the pearch bite the end of your worm off, you gotta put a new one on. The only way to get the eyes under the bridge is a full worm and no jewelry with it.  So I been told. At night from shore, a Rapala will work"
