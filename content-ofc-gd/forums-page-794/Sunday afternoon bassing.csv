We usually take my buddy's kids up there because there are alot of largemouth under a pound and it is fun for them and you are guaranteed to catch lots of them everytime you go. We found out yesterday that one of the pods has smallies and largies. The smallmouth seem bigger like they have been in there for a while. We were hitting a few around a pound, and then this hog appeared. The owner had no idea fish of this size were in there and I have a fished it a few times and never seen anything this size before.  We reckon it was around 4lbs and to put it in perspective, I am 6 foot 3 and 250 lbs. This was a hog of a fish and my PB for bass.      What a great sunday it turned out to be. Will be heading up there again real soon."
