378316,Weeds,2009-08-31 02:05:00,782,"I was doing a little smallmouth bass fishing this evening, chucking a 5 inch Senko along the riverbank with my trusty 7 foot St. Croix ML spinning outfit.  After not getting a strike during the Senko's initial drop I reeled it in quickly, already thinking of my next cast and the Senko bouncing along the surface at a pretty good clip. I was stunned when close to the bank a Musky smoked it between skips of the Senko, partly because I did not believe there were any Musky in this part of the river and partly because the co-ordination involved in the strike was incredible. I think the musky actually hit the Senko between skips, out of the air, but who really knows as these things happen pretty fast.  Fortunately it was a small fish which might account for it's agility, about 26 inches, and the spinning tackle and 10 pound Fluro was up to the job. Had him hauled in, unhooked, gawked at and released in about 2 minutes. Was very cool.  My first incidental Musky. Senko's are proving to be surprisingly versatile, in the past two weeks I've caught both small and largemouth on them, assorted panfish, pike, Musky and one mean looking Bowfin on them. I only wish I'd starting using them years ago."

378321,jaydub,2009-08-31 02:19:00,145,Nice to hear about your senko success!  I'm planning on doing some serious senko fishing this week and hope for the same results you've had...I'd love to snag a nice musky!
378348,ciceri,2009-08-31 03:58:00,535,Friend got a musky on a senko a few weeks ago.... We've gotten alot of musky strikes reeling our lures in across top of the water too.
378367,mbosh1980,2009-08-31 09:01:00,349,"friend landed a 42"" muskie on a 5"" gulp leech last year. not a senko, but same sized plastic, texas rigged. Come to think of it I think it was just about this time of year as well."
378374,Jer,2009-08-31 10:50:00,1426,"Not on a Senko exactly, but several years ago I did get a 36"" musky on a 7"" texas rigged power-worm. I was just dragging on bottom and suddenly my line moved 12' in about 2 seconds."
378423,4thgen,2009-08-31 14:16:00,157,"A couple years ago I was dragging a Senko back to the boat when I had a solid hit. I set the hook and almost simultaneously a ~35"" musky launched out of the water about ten feet away. He spit it pretty quick (light line = weak hook set) but it was nice to break up the bass monotony."
378434,mepps,2009-08-31 14:47:00,1301,I've had a couple muskies on em - lost a big one that straightened the hook
378436,Roy,2009-08-31 14:51:00,13728,"Where muskies are concerned, if it moves, it's food."
378463,K_F,2009-08-31 16:47:00,107,"Ive had 2 muskies on, on senkos this year.  none landed tho"
