You may be able to find cheaper air charter out of Nakina or maybe Armstrong, but you'd have to fly your canoes in, a more expensive proposition. When you fly with Hearst Air you're using their boats which are cached on Hawley lake. There used to be an air charter service in Moosonee and that would've been your best bet. Unfortunately they're not in business anymore."
