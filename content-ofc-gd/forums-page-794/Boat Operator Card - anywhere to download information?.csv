377903,TC1OZ,2009-08-30 02:10:00,987,Depends on who you are taking the boating exam from....  Most companies use questions that are verbatim from their study materials.
377926,jimvanm,2009-08-30 02:57:00,27,"Thanks a ton for the response.  I did a bit more digging and found this, which also includes sample questions:  http://www.boatsmartexam.com/manual.cfm  Thanks again!"
377989,Jer,2009-08-30 13:06:00,1426,"It's a pretty simple test. I did it last year in the Home Hardware parking lot (pay if you pass) on a whim and only got 2 questions wrong. I didn't study at all, had just driven a boat for 15 years. Most are common sense, the only ones I had trouble with were the sailboat lighting configurations."
378001,jimvanm,2009-08-30 13:55:00,27,"Agreed, but my 12 year old daughter wants to get her card as well, and for her I was looking for a study guide that doesn't read like a legal document. The one I found online seems to fit the bill. We went through some of the sample tests together, and she guesses more right than I did, so I think we're on the right track here."

378091,jimvanm,2009-08-30 17:39:00,27,I'll look into it. I'm very much interested in her accomplishing more than just passing the test.
