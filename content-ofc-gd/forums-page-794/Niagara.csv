I don't think many salmon would be there... but what about rainbows, bass, others... ???  Are there any other accessable spots on that river.. in that general area ???  Ive never fished that river before Any suggestions / areas would be helpfull to me   Thanx..."

Stop in at Fishin Niagara, right on the Niagara parkway in Ft Erie. He can tell you what's up at some of the local shore locations. On spot is across the road from the store."

378753,denisk,2009-09-01 12:14:00,163,"The upper is fishing well lately due to cooler water temps.  A sure bet is both smallies and largies, but there is a few good spots for shore pike and muskie.  I wouldn't discount your chances at a steelie but you will have to fish choice times and keep moving but i've seen more then a handful caught recently     As far as the lower goes I can't help you but look up Paul from cast adventures he's got the lower dialed in pretty good."
