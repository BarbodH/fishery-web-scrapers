I am officially obsessed with it..  Here are some pics of my larger top water frog fishing results ( all are Scum Frogs)  caught on 30lb Power Pro braided line. ( in no particular order)                  and.... last but not least..... my PB 23"" smallie caught in the weeds on a top water scum frog...    Geee.. .I wonder if SCUM FROG .... is tracking the FREE ADVERTISING  I am giving them and will send me a case of these ?  I am heading out tomorrow morning... rain or no rain...  I AM going dammit!....  lol  Splashhopper"

377667,Stein,2009-08-29 04:19:00,22,That smallie is fricken awesome!
377693,Radnine,2009-08-29 11:18:00,1538,Patience eh? You have to wait before setting the hook. How did you train yourself not to yank it too early? Jim
377908,splashhopper,2009-08-30 02:27:00,2931," I ""trained "" myself to not set the hook to early by doing the following alot >>   Now i ""try"" to FEEL the hit before i set the hook..."
377963,singingdog,2009-08-30 10:27:00,1047,"You're a more patient man than I....topwater frogs are the most frustrating lures I have ever used. No matter how long I wait, the hookup/hit ratio is the lowest of anything I have ever tried. Sounds like you are having fun."
377968,splashhopper,2009-08-30 11:34:00,2931," I am also learning how to use Senko's ( rigged weedless) right now.... I seem to have the same ""miss-ratio"" on them as well...  I think it has more to do with me fishing on top of the slop and pads though....  When I use poppers or jitter-bugs on open water... the hook up ratio is a LOT better.   What else can I use on top of the slop ?"
