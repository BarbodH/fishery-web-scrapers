I never heard so much whining.  Great finish. Man I thought it was had,til that last turn.  Oh, and what was up Kyle?    It,s becoming to much with him.   Great race,WELCOME TO   Hats of to the young Canadian gun, Ranger. Thought he had a chance."
378232,Canuck2fan,2009-08-30 23:36:00,1444,"I am a Carl Edwards fan and happy for the win and the points gain, but I still felt bad for Ambrose....  Kyle what can you say but that he has million dollar speed but a 5Â¢ head, like so many talented racers before him who just had no PR skills.... They have to stop making him bottle up his intensity after a screwup though. Let him vent in public like he used to and be himself and the sport would be a heck of lot more entertaining for everyone LOL."
378233,misfish,2009-08-30 23:40:00,29133,"Dont get me wrong here.Carl did a great job. That was racing at it,s finiest.Mistake made and capitalized on."
378238,Greencoachdog,2009-08-30 23:55:00,8163,"Only 30-some-odd-days 'til the tallywhacker run in Talledega... gawd I dread it!!!... what chaos!!!  Maybe some day a ""Hoser"" will head down this way for the race and I can show them my favorite fishin' spot... not the dam, nowhere near the dam!!!"
378247,Canuck2fan,2009-08-31 00:08:00,1444,I agree Carl did a fabulous job but if there weren't so many idiots causing cautions Carl wasn't going to catch him... I never like it when the best car/driver loses for dumb reasons and some of those guys in the back should have been parked today.
378299,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-31 01:22:00,10439,"Kyle is a little brat and a sore loser!!! He reminds me of Jeff Goron when he was younger. When he doesn't win he goes and has a tantrum.  Anouncer: ""Kyle describe your run today.""  Kyle: ""Well Dave it sucked ass, I came in second, I had a lousy day!!!""  Race Fan: ""Well BOO HOO dip stick, GET OVER YOURSELF!!!!!!""   Send him in for an EGOECTOMY!!!!!  On the bright side it was a good race and an exciting finish. I did feel bad for Marcus though."
378303,Lunatic,2009-08-31 01:32:00,536,"I hated all the boring cautions! the wrecks were cool tho.  glad ANYONE but the shurb won it. i was pulling for ambrose,but carl aint so bad so good outcome.  i hate hate hate kyle busch,i cant stand looking at his ugly head,so id rather him run off into his camper after a race then have to look at its head whine during a post race interview!!"
378310,redneck666,2009-08-31 01:46:00,563,"i agree! kyle busch is a whinner with a big ego. i was goin for marcus  but i'm glad that carl won. all in all, it was a good race!"
378483,wallyboss,2009-08-31 17:41:00,1095,"Carl waited and waited and it paid off!  You never know when the guy in front of you is going to give you an inch, but you have to be there when he gives it to you."
