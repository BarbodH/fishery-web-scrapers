We had to wait out some thunder and lightning for a few hours in the morning.  It still beats sitting at home.  I was really hoping to hook into a pickerel or two.  No luck though.  We managed a dozen small mouths, and a hand full of hammer handles.  I tried out those new Mustad Slow Death hooks.  I really liked the way they work.  That's what I cought all the small mouth on.  Unfortunately, I was targeting the eyes, and for that reason, I was letting the fish nibble a bit more before setting the hook.  A couple of the bass took the hook way to deep.  Shore lunch….   We were only able to fish for about 6 hours in total because of bad weather and excessive drinkin.  I’m not done up there yet.  I know the pickerel are there somewhere.   Next time I think I’ll go for a week, instead of two days!  I’ve only started to target pickerel this year, and have still yet to catch one  No pictures, cuz none of the fish where worthy.   Sorry for the poor report.  Next time there will be lots of pictures of eyes, and massive muskies"
