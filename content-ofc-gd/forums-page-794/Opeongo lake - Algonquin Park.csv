I've never seen this lake and am wondering wether anyone is familiar with any campsites where I'd be able to beach my Princecraft 17 1/2 footer.Are there any (many) sandy beach campsites?  Also from what I've read, the central part of the lake that joins the 3 arms together is shallow. How shallow is shallow? How's the fishing? Thanks, Jack."
