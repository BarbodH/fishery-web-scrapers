377978,Gerritt,2009-08-30 12:29:00,6129,"A couple months ago my girlfriend lost her first ""child"" and best friend...  Rusty was a 13 year old Chocolate Lab, and the hard decision was made to have him put down...  With that in mind her birthday was coming up and I was at a loss as to what to do for her...  Then it came to me....  So I contacted a few family members and got the ball rolling....  Here is what we did....  I hope you like it as much as she does...            These pictures do not do the painting any justice... but give you the general idea..  I am thinking of framing it in barnboard to go with the country setting of our property..  I would like to thank the artist that painted this for me on VERY short notice. Without him I would not have seen this..     I will leave the artist anonymous.. unless he wants to come forward and present himself.. A huge thank you for helping me pull this off!!!  G."

378187,bushart,2009-08-30 22:08:00,2628,"Hey Gerritt,  Glad we were able to pull it off within that timeframe,  Definetely is a thoughtful thing to do.  darn that Misfish guy though---you know them hunters--always lookin for clues,  I kept one of the last pics--may give a little clearer view---that canvas was kinda big and all that green really gives a glare in the pic taking.  All The Best.  Me  "
