378269,RsX,2009-08-31 00:37:00,48,iam going to try braided line with my bait caster and been researching and see that u gotta use a differernt kind of knot with braid so what knots do u guys use with braid and what do u think of braided with a bait caster??
378270,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-31 00:39:00,3761,Palomar man. You should wet it though(spit) it seems to seize up a little better IMO.
378282,Garry2Rs,2009-08-31 01:00:00,1425,This year I like 40 pound Fireline braid on my Bass size casting reels.  It is very round and smooth. Here are the two knots you will need.  The Palomar is strong but can be a pain if you are tying on a crank bait.  
378293,BillM,2009-08-31 01:17:00,17367,"When tying a palomar, I always add another half loop once I've tightened it down.  Dunno if it helps or not, lol"
378298,Syn,2009-08-31 01:21:00,519,"...........and don't forget arbor tape before your arbor knot, or mono backing in case the braid slips on the arbor while fighting a big fish."
378302,Twocoda,2009-08-31 01:30:00,4130,also ....i think you may find out how hard a birds nest is to clean up on a baitcaster ....it isnt too much fun ...hope you dont find out like i did when braid first came out ...i went back to mono and never looked back...
378304,danada,2009-08-31 01:34:00,31,somewhere in georgian bay i have a baitcaster with a $30 braided birdsnest.
378307,Twocoda,2009-08-31 01:41:00,4130,  If a buddy of mine didnt have his fillet knife with him for me to cut it all off ....my baitcaster would most likely be laying beside yours at the bottom ...
378308,Weeds,2009-08-31 01:41:00,782,The greater the test strength  of the braid the easier it becomes to pick out the tangles and birdsnests. In my experience 50 to 80 pound braid is untangled way easier than mono.
378309,Twocoda,2009-08-31 01:43:00,4130, thats where i went wrong then ....i used 20 pound test....
378317,Weeds,2009-08-31 02:11:00,782," Yeah, I've tried 20 pound braid and found it pretty awful picking out the tangles.  I imagine if you've got a  high end baitcasting reel and some really polished skills you might make it work."
378371,Greencoachdog,2009-08-31 09:59:00,8163," I use the improved clinch knot with both mono and braid and never have a problem!  If you are used to using a baitcasting reel, then you shouldn't have any problems with braid on it... but as mentioned above, I'd go with a 40# or more test.  The difference between a good fisherman and a bad fisherman is that the good fisherman can always untangle his backlashes, a bad fisherman will either cut the line or throw the reel overboard!  The difference between a good fisherman and a great fisherman is... a great fisherman never gets a backlash!  I'm just a good fisherman!"
378372,singingdog,2009-08-31 10:32:00,1047," Not true. I am relativly new to baitcasters (2nd season) and use lower-end reels with 20 lb PowerPro. I have had a few backlashes, only one that I couldn't get out on the water. Most folks I know find it easier to get the birdsnests out with braid than with mono....gotta have a small hook on hand."
