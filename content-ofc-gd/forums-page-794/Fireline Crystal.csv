377834,Kinger,2009-08-29 20:46:00,351,"I was wondering if anyone has some words about the positives and negatives (if any) using Fireline Crystal. I am thinking of using it on my salmon rod with a large shimano spinning reel. I fish from the bank or piers, any help would be greatly appreciated."
377840,GBW,2009-08-29 21:31:00,8460,I took it off all my reels and only use it as backing on my baitcaster as filler.  It's not round and doesn't cast well.  I have never had a problem with spiderwire on any reel.
377842,e-z-out,2009-08-29 21:35:00,1052,I've used it and i do like it. Only one of my reels have Fireline Crystal and the rest power pro. So far i'm happy with it.
377843,CLofchik,2009-08-29 21:41:00,854,"Never used it, but it has a thick dia. that would cut down on capacity."
377846,TJQ,2009-08-29 21:45:00,7806,"Ive bought it, and dont like it..  I use the regular fireline and swaer by it!"
377848,spinnerbaitking,2009-08-29 21:46:00,1622,It SUCKS never made it threw the day & it was in the garbage Richard
377849,jediangler,2009-08-29 21:48:00,1923,I like it and think you will be very happy with it on a pier fishing set-up. I use it on my spinning rods only and use power pro on my baitcasters. I even use the 10lb test crystal on my ultra-light.
377852,Kinger,2009-08-29 21:55:00,351,"Thanks for the thoughts guys,  I asked a couple of my friends on my instant messanger as well and they don't recommend it either. I think I will stick with Power Pro."
377853,Fisherpete,2009-08-29 22:00:00,1814,"Stick with Power Pro. The Fireline Crystal frays very easily, and does not cast as well as the same diameter Power Pro."
377873,Mike the Pike,2009-08-30 00:10:00,3421,"I don't like it is too slippery and hard to tie knots with.  P-line ,Stren Super braid or Power pro are much better choices."
377901,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-30 02:06:00,0,"i still like mono, or if i'm feeling saucy, mono with a fluoro leader. i haven't liked a braid or superline more than plain mono yet."
377906,gogu392,2009-08-30 02:18:00,142,After I use PowerPro I decided to drop FireLine. PowerPro is better.
377944,redneck666,2009-08-30 04:35:00,563,"yup im with Dr.S, i just used 10lb berkley trilene mono. and i caught a 22"" roughly 6lb salmon tonight with it! and if your paying attention it doesnt fray.... at least with me anyway. i just did buy some berkley stuff.... the package is silver, im pretty sure its flouro...."
378428,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-31 14:30:00,1022,"  All fireline frays easy, other then that its good. For this reason I switched to strictly power pro. Power pro just loses its die a bit."
378440,NAW,2009-08-31 15:16:00,4022,  I second that.
378492,ciceri,2009-08-31 18:20:00,535,"I use it and like it, pretty strong stuff. But out on Georgian Bay with all the rocks, it frays alot. If power pro had a white version, I'd use that."
378493,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-31 18:25:00,1022,Some reels have poorly engineered bails that have sharp corners that fray the line as well. Anyone with a quantum energy pt-i take a look at the corner of the bail. 170$ reel and it frays line  . From now on when selecting a reel I pay close attention to this small detail.
378550,bubbles,2009-08-31 20:23:00,591,"  I have the same issue, angry to say the least.  Let me know when you come up with a solution, I have struck out so far."
378750,Carp,2009-09-01 12:04:00,1488,"I never tried the crystal, but have been using regular Fireline for years on my spinning rods and love it. I also use power pro and have not had issues with that either."
