378027,Joey,2009-08-30 14:33:00,9122,"Wow, that's amazing.  Thanks for posting that.  It gave me a good chuckle, even tho I don't understand what they're saying.  Joey"
378028,pikehunter,2009-08-30 14:35:00,1659,That is one confused moose. Or maybe a smart one? Befriend the hunter and you won't be a target. Great video! Now if I had only studied French while in school.
378029,Roy,2009-08-30 14:39:00,13728,"Funny  as hell Randy, thanks for that."
378030,Muskieman,2009-08-30 14:40:00,2472,"They tease the driver saying that he's made a ""girlfriend"" then go to tell him to kiss her on the nose...  The driver vows to not shoot her in the fall if they ever meet again...  The last guy walking and singing with her invites her home for some  ""Deer and Carrot"" soup.  Very Very cool.  RFS "
378042,Stern Rules,2009-08-30 15:13:00,342,What a great vid. That was awesome. Pretty funny. I could never shoot that moose after that.
378067,richyb,2009-08-30 16:19:00,774,I had a cow moose at arms reach one year while moose hunting ( no tag) but she wasnt as friendly as that one. The camp next to us shot her calf and she had a hate for orange !!!!!  I yelled at her and she started to run and started running at the guys I was hunting with. dad had to jump behind a tree 2 times because she was running at him. Funny at the time but afterwards we figured we were lucky not to get hurt.

378328,Jonny,2009-08-31 02:33:00,1380,Great video!  It's not unknown for moose to be easily tamed but this is certainly unusual.
378424,Mr Mojo Risin,2009-08-31 14:17:00,17,funny video.. but am I the only one noticing the driver with the open blue lite while behind the wheel ?
378426,Jonny,2009-08-31 14:29:00,1380," No, but it's Quebec."
378429,highdrifter,2009-08-31 14:30:00,2534,"Aye c'est malade ça!!  Donnes-y un beau bec...  Bonne chose que la saison était fermée, mais je me demande si elle a toughée l'hivers...  Mauditement trippant mon homme!!  merci HD"

378563,misfish,2009-08-31 21:18:00,29133,Very cool vid. Those guys talk funny though.LOL  I clicked on the chained bear vid. She got what she deserved. Chained bear and he still got a piece of her.Should of gotten more then what she did.
378570,Handlebarz,2009-08-31 21:34:00,3790,Brian I am with you on that one to bad there was people there to help her out that would have made some great lessons for these goofs that do that to them. Now the moose that was cool I guess you just need to get them drunk before they will say yes also.
