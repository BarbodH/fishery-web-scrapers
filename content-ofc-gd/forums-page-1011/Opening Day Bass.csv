217314,Canuck2fan,2008-06-19 19:01:00,1444, I am probably being a little optimistic only on account of being restricted from using smallie candy there this year. Not being able to use their favorite bait is going to put a lot more largies into play. So I might wind up having to work for smallies this year. Last year on the opener I had 4 fish in 5 casts... and the only reason I didn't have to walk home was I drove and had the keys my buddy got skunked that will teach him to stand on shore smoking while I was gathering the smallie candy LOL. It was a beautiful start to the year.
213353,danbouck,2008-06-10 00:56:00,4380,Just wondering where everybody is going for opening day for bass?  I will be heading down to the cottage in Long Point with the family for a 4 day weekend!

213360,danbouck,2008-06-10 01:06:00,4380, Always is! But this year I start fishing at 12:01 AM

213491,jwl,2008-06-10 04:53:00,1056,"I know quite a few people that look forward to bass opener just as much as a kid at Christmas, for me no real allure to go just ""bass fishing"" for the day, I figure I catch enough of them throughout the year while fishing for everything else that it doesn't matter...reminds me of a time me and a buddy where at camp trying to scope out a couple spots for pickereyes, the first spot we tried ..between the 2 of us we probably boated about 30 smallies of all mixed sizes in under an hour, it was litterally almost every cast we each had on on..it got to the point that we where laughing our mule off over the fact that we where cathcing so many fish but still though it was a bummer cuz it wasn't what we where after at the time."
