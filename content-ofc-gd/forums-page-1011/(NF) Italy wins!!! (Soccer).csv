I love to celebrate, and in a matter of fact im going out tonite with my jersey on to celebrate...why ? because i have about 5-6 ital friends and we enjoy celebrating and going crazy together... because we can and its fun. We definitely DO NOT destroy things and cause damage, but flag waving and honking is a must. Some people are just inconsiderate and rude. Which is why there nations are considered that way, especially when advertising your country and doing it......a guess a couple bad apples does ruin the whole batch?  FORZA AZZURI  Pachone"

They have been by far the best teams in the competition.  The kind of football they play is exciting and entertaining.  It's about time that teams like Italy and Germany (who usually do very well in these tournaments) which grind out results rather than playing exciting and attacking football don't make it to the final!  Contraversial statement .... I know, but an unbiased opinion ;-)  Good luck to all 'your' teams - may the best team win!  007"
