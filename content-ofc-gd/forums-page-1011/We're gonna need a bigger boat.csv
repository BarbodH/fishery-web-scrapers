216807,JohnF,2008-06-18 14:26:00,3494," Yikes! That is one big gator. That's even big for a croc.  Reminds me of my first venture into cave diving in the Yucatan. We got geared up and were floating in the centre of a crystal clear cenote while my instructor gave me the drill for the dive. To stall off the entry into the cave (did I mention how intimidating one's first cave diving experience is?) I pointed out how pretty the setting was with the mangroves surrounding the sparkling pond. He said ""It's even better at night with all the red lights in the trees."" I asked ""Red lights?"" His response ""Yeah. The crocs eyes reflect red our lights. They're all around us right now."" ..... Crap!!!! It sure made me feel a lot more inclined to get way back in the cave real quick.  Somehow I doubt a 12' tinny on that lake would feel quite as secure as 1,000' of cave passage if I knew the water monsters in the area were 28' long.  JF"

216818,Bly,2008-06-18 14:42:00,1556,"First Picture is real but the story is not.  ""Her neighbors in Bar X Ranch had been telling them they had seen a giant alligator in the bayou that runs behind their house, but they dismissed the stories as exaggerations.  ""I didn't believe it"", Charles Rogers said.  Friday, they realized the stories were, if anything, understated.  Texas Parks and Wildlife game wardens had to shoot the beast. ""  Original caption under the picture Joe Goff, a game warden with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, walks past a 13-foot, 1-inch alligator that he shot and killed in the back yard of the home at the Bar X Ranch on FM 521 near West Columbia.  Photo was taken by Val Horvath.  Information on the Second picture (with more pictures) deer shots"

216940,johnnyb,2008-06-18 19:03:00,3413,"the pic with the deer in it's mouth looked a bit suspect....either way it's one big gator.  And if that Warden really is 6.5, I don't think I wanna mess with him either!"
216943,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-18 19:10:00,4399,"LOL the story and the legend will only get bigger much like the pike pictures we all know and love, in a couple of years the gator will be 38 feet long and it will be from Alberta."
