216165,snag,2008-06-16 18:17:00,1932,Awesome!  What you caught in a day is more than some catch in a year.
216220,kickingfrog,2008-06-16 21:00:00,8333," Hey, was that directed at me???"
216222,Jigger,2008-06-16 21:32:00,1237,"Nice haul, guys. You did good to head that way Johnny, Sinker knows his water for sure! Great lookin 'skis for both of you! Guess you made the right choice...both of you. WTG!"

216628,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-17 21:44:00,0,"Thanks again guys! It was an incredible day! With 2 nice musky landed. A 40+ lost, and I seen a 38 incher and 2, 40's follow Sinker's lure. Mind you, some could have been the same fish. Still, We seen a lot of big fish. I was too busy catching dinner and not targeting Muskys. Of which I just had an amazing fish fry!!"
216716,tibbs,2008-06-18 03:09:00,650,Great Report!  Nice fish!
216721,Sinker,2008-06-18 03:14:00,8692,"  What took you so long to eat them.....LOL. Mine made a great fathers day dinner for me and the kids  I couldn't resist a little taster saturday night too.....  We'll definitly have to do that again bud, it was great fishing with you!  Sinker"
216786,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-18 13:17:00,0, Timing! I was a little busy! I cooked up that little jumbo perch too.It had a strong fishy taste but it went down good! I think I am going to try a few more different fish and may invest in a smoker. MMMMMMMMMM  Definitely have to do it again! I enjoyed myself also! Thanks again for taking me out!
217455,Mike the Pike,2008-06-20 02:13:00,3421,Excellent report and pics .Beautiful Muskie.  Did you get a new camera cause those pics are much clearer than last year
217460,buckster,2008-06-20 02:20:00,530,wtg boys!   thats how u get'er done
217466,Sinker,2008-06-20 02:38:00,8692,"Hahaha.....we took the pics with my camera this time mike. Its nothing special, but it does take a decent shot. Better than a cell phone anyways.  Sinker"
217568,Fish Farmer,2008-06-20 14:26:00,2234,"Great report Johnny, thanks for sharing."
215687,Sinker,2008-06-15 13:25:00,8692, Thanks for the replies folks  Come on up GCD!! JB should change his name to JohnnyPickeral! He was nailin em'!  Sinker
215692,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-15 13:40:00,0,Ya thanks guys!  And the secret lure is...... a secret.lol
215704,Sinker,2008-06-15 14:09:00,8692,"  Most fish were caught on deep weed edges. 10-12 FOW. JB's secret lure caught them on a weed flat in 7-9FOW with scattered weeds. I find in the kawartha's, you have to be on deep weedlines, once water temps reach ~70F. Temp yesterday was anywhere from 70-73F. I don't have much luck on these lakes any deeper, until late in the season.  Sinker"
215707,kickingfrog,2008-06-15 14:18:00,8333, Sounds like bait.
215708,Sinker,2008-06-15 14:21:00,8692,No bait was harmed in the making of this fishing report  That would be cheating....
215710,jwl,2008-06-15 14:28:00,1056,"wicked report, sounds like a pretty good time, and a fair bit of musky action throughouut the day, a couple nice fish landed, and some follws ect on the way."
215751,kickingfrog,2008-06-15 18:43:00,8333, And the legend grows.
215753,fishindevil,2008-06-15 18:48:00,6254,Nice report guys & great fishing too !!!!!..  .good job on the muskies too..  .so what time is the fish fry??...cheers
215758,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-15 18:59:00,0," I don't know what you mean by this, but the fish was caught on a crankbait."
215760,kickingfrog,2008-06-15 19:03:00,8333,Just havin' fun.
215849,steve_paul,2008-06-15 23:27:00,658,"Nice job boys, great day on the water.  Thanks for the report JB and Sinker"

215867,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 00:17:00,7971,"Great job guys!  I've met and fished with Sinker before....got us into some walleye and an OOS muskie.  Awesome catches for a day....I don't know anyone who wouldn't be happy with that kind of outing!  Hey Sinker....surprised to see a pic of a rock bass in there....but then again, how can they be unlucky with the kind of day you had....LOL."
215873,Sinker,2008-06-16 00:19:00,8692,  Hahaha.......JB wanted a pc of his WGSF. Apparently they are highly regarded by some  
215947,mistyriver1,2008-06-16 02:54:00,600,Nice report Johnny.  Congrats to you and Sinker.

216038,majorlifts,2008-06-16 13:41:00,171,"  Thanks for the tip sinker, I will put your advise to work this weekend. lookin forward to hitting the eyes all day long."
216045,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-16 13:57:00,0, 90% of the pickerel were caught on white grubs with bright jig heads. Good luck!
216048,Victor,2008-06-16 14:08:00,1609," Uh, so your secret lure only caught 10% of the WALLEYE    it's not all that great after all  Nice haul guys! Thanks for posting JohnnyBass."
216051,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-16 14:20:00,0, Well it is a weed flat lure. I like to burn and pause it right over the weeds.We spent most of the time on Weed lines. Plus I didn't use it much around the weed lines. Since the grubs were working fine.
216057,spinin jay,2008-06-16 14:52:00,17,"WTG fella's!!!!!!!!!! Nice pics and cool read,thanks for sharin!!"
216164,snagmaster,2008-06-16 18:12:00,250,awesome report guys.....those are the kinda days we all dream of...lol
215610,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-15 01:32:00,0,"Decided to go fishing with another board member. Sinker. Got up and drove to his place and we were on the lake by 7:00.  Drove to the first spot and it it wasn't long before I got my first pickeral. Then another, then another and it wasn't even an hour yet. Here are two of them.      Then Sinker gets a hit on his musky spinner bait and brings in another pickeral.    Then it started pouring. And it got harder and harder. The forecast called for light rain so I didn't bring my rain gear. I was soaked.  We continued to fish and Sinker gets his first follow. A nice healthy Musky. Didn't commit......  Sinker noticed that everyone was working the same areas so decided to go to a spot that no one was working. Sinker gets a hit but it didn't commit it followed to the boat but was hard to make out.  A little later? I get a hit on my Musky spinner bait. Musky!! After a few jumps, she was in the boat. 40 inches.  Here she is. My first legal Musky of the season.    Here's me fighting it.    A little while later Sinker's Spinner gets smoked! After a brief fight brings it in and its another healthy fish. 39 inches and fat!!!His first legal Musky!    Release shot.    We are both pretty happy at this point.  Then he gets ANOTHER 38-40 inch fish follow to the boat!!Doesn't commit. I get a little snok rocket musky follow to the boat. Doesn't commit.  Then we got to spot number 3. We are working it with no luck. Then I tell Sinker to close his eyes. I start pulling out the secret weapons. Pull out my favourite crank bait, and was explaining to Sinker what a great pickerel lure this was. But it only works on certain lakes, so I will give it a try.  First cast? Smack!! Fish on, Its a 18 inch pickerel.     Sinker is in disbelief. Then I get a monster bird's nest and wasted at least 20 minutes getting it free.A little while latter? Whack!! Another pickeral in the boat. Just to show Sinker it wasn't a fluke.lol    We were going to head to another of Sinker's spots but I say lets go back to the area we started at.  We do a drift and Sinker hooks a 40+ inch Mucky and is fat as heck!! After a brief fight and some acrobatics, the Musky spit out the hook!! Sinker's heart was pounding!lol  Went back to the first spot and sinker hooks two pickerel back to back on a grub. Then I hook one on a grub, while Sinker has one on two. Double header but his is a sunfish.      Sinker had to be home early so we called it a day.  There were probably more follows seen by Sinker that I cant remember. He was fishing mostly for musky and me mostly for pickerel. We also caught a few cigar pickerel that we released with no picture. We also caught some pan fish and bass. Sinker is definately the panfish king! He was slaying the sunfish.lol  Oh and I caught the WGSF!    Well it was great meeting another OFC member. He is really a great guide and really knows his fishing! Hope to do it again soon!!  Hope you enjoyed my report."
215611,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-15 01:37:00,2585,"Awesome report!  Got to love an opening hour like that!  Nice ""skis"" as well!  Cheers!"
215612,Rich,2008-06-15 01:38:00,3927,Great stuff Johnny and Sinker! Now ya got us all wonderin' what the secret pickerel crank is!  Nice muskies god I hope to get up for them again soon!

215617,Sinker,2008-06-15 02:06:00,8692,"Great day of fishin Johnny!! Was nice to meet ya, we'll have to do it again!!  That magic lure of yours was pretty cool. Johnny blindfolded me, tied it on, and would only let me look while it was in the water......I have no idea what it was......but it blew my mind when he caught a fish on the first cast with it....  ....lucky I say...  ...then he nails another one...  ...Geeze.....I'd better get me one of them!! LOL  Glad to finally put a musky in the boat.......on my line....LOL. I just finished telling johnny that whenever I take someone out musky fishing with me, they get all the fish. No sooner did I say that, and he's got one on  ......frig.....I though for sure I was doomed! LOL I got mine minutes after though...  ..thank the fish gods!!!   The musky I lost went berzerk.....it hit about 10 ft out, and just went nuts on the surface. Flipping and twisting and jumping.....I had a bad feeling, then he spit my spinner back at me. Oh well......I know where he lives, and I have his number!!! I'll get him next time......  Great day, great company, and lots of action, and I just finished a killer fry of fresh eyes.......does it get any better than that?  Sinker"
