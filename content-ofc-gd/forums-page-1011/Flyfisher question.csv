217271,highdrifter,2008-06-19 17:09:00,2534," That's the secret words for the day.  You'll want a stout 6 or 7 wheight rod and a bass taper wheight forward line, preferably nymph tip.  I say nymph cause Scientific Anglers makes one that sinks slower than a lead core.  A sink tip line in the conditions you've specified would make you want to toss your whole set up in the drink and reach for your spinning rod.  Also, you may have been encouraged to purchase a bass taper fly line if you'll be targeting bass.  This taper is great if you're casting big bushy flies on a pond or a calm lake, with plenty of room for your back cast, but they're quite heavy and are somewhat difficult to mend in fast water.  You won't be throwing bunny leeches and bucktails, so a heavy taper is not necessary.  Go with a regular wheight forward taper, and add some shot if you wanna your fly to get down faster.  This is the most versatile set-up IMHO, because you can work surface (poppers) or subsurface (buggers) and you don't require getting multiple tapers or several spools to carry them in.  Flies...  Be sure to stock a good selection of black, brown and olive wollybuggers (beadheads are deadly and don't require adding more shot), mudler minnows, hellgramites and other assorted streamer patterns like rainbow smelts, deceivers, to name a few.  Hope this helps!  Send me a pm if you have any other questions.  cheers  Tiiiight Loops HD"

I've got one pretty decent spinning rig with some backbone and a sensitive tip that might just be a lot of fun with 20# of carp trying to break it. Or there's a spot where two rivers meet where you can hunt carp in one pool and I can be 50' away on another pool usually good for some nice bass.  JF
217276,JohnF,2008-06-19 17:17:00,3494," As long as my aged brain can keep processing all this input I'll be a bass/fly authority soon.  Seriously, this stuff is great. I'm making notes. We'll start to put it to the test a week from Saturday. I'm really looking ofrward to it.  I don't expect wondrous results first time out, or perhaps even the second, but if I get skunked on my third time I'm firing all of you and going back to the spinning rod. Actually, I've got a new Quantum baitcaster that needs some practice. That might be my next challenge after the flyrod.  JF"
217280,highdrifter,2008-06-19 17:25:00,2534," Bahh.. Don't worry, you won't be casting chronomids on a 7x tippet for spooky browns.. this is after all smallie fishing.  Keep it simple, focus on keeping your forearm tight to your side, and keep your wrist locked up, lower your tip as you are ending your forward cast, MEND, and repeat...  Most of all, have fun!  Don't forget the kodak!!  cheers H to the D"
