217168,cranks bait,2008-06-19 12:40:00,721,I'm logged in for one thread and then logged out for the next.  I can only read what I read yesterday.  Anything new is gone?  What's going on?  Any ideas?  Hopefully I'll see them.
217172,wuchikubo,2008-06-19 12:46:00,1114,Not having any problems here Scott. Computer virus may be a possibility.
217174,ccmtcanada,2008-06-19 12:52:00,7971,Hmmm...things are ok here.  First thing I'd do is re-boot the computer.  Second thing would be to clear the internet cookies and then try again.
217184,cranks bait,2008-06-19 13:22:00,721,No viruses.  Did what you said Cliff and it seems to be working.  Thanks.  Odd that it was just this site though?
217196,BillM,2008-06-19 13:35:00,17367,"Scott, you broke the internet"
217199,cranks bait,2008-06-19 13:39:00,721," I just found out they had internet on computers now, so I thought I would try."
