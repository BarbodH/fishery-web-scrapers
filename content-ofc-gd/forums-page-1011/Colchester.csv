Father in law was a little hesitant to dive in ( his boat, his choice) so we headed for breakfast. Got back to the ramp and watched a bunch of boats go out and decided it was starting to calm down enough that we would give it a shot. On the water by 9:30 and off by 3pm with ten nice fish for the freezer. The water by mid day barely had a ripple and the fish were there although not as hard as I have seen but I guess that is to be expected right after the storm. One bonus for the day was there were very few non target fish. We only caught two sheephead and maybe a dozen silver bass. Can't wait to get back again.   "

216894,Chrispy,2008-06-18 17:52:00,168,"Hey Taper....how were you fishing??  Using harnesses, snap weights and planers???  I will be out there next weekend, I just live in Windsor......great fishery in that area.....usually start around the helo pad and work my way to the mile marker......great area for bass and perch too!!!   Chrispy!"
216992,taper,2008-06-18 21:38:00,611,"Chrispy, I was using inline boards, bottom bouncers and worm harnesses, that's all I ever use down there after a charter captain showed me the ropes. I must say though the biggest change was buying the tattle tale flag kits for the Offshore boards. They are a huge improvement. We pretty much were trolling with the huge pack around the mile marker."
217178,Chrispy,2008-06-19 13:04:00,168,Right on!!  I use both....bottom bouncers and snap weights.....both work awesome on the smaller boards.....a good friend Bobby Devine from Extreme Angler explained to me how to run the setup and first time I tried it ended up picking up 8 nice eaters between me and my cousin......as I do it more I am sure I will get a set pattern down and start picking up even more fish......just as long as I can keep those rubber lipped fish off of them worm harnesses!!!!  LOL!!!!  I run an 18' Sylvan (white and blue) with a 75 Merc and a 6 horse 4 stroke Honda kicker.....if ya see me make sure to say HEY!!!!  I might be able to help with other spots in that area.....take care!!!  Chrispy!
