215561,ChrisK,2008-06-14 21:30:00,2772,"Got a little favour I need from all of you who are collecting contributions for our prize table. We are going to do a little ""thank you for your donations"" thread for all the tackle shops and other local businesses that contributed prizes for our Lakair G2G event. What we need is for everyone to PM a list to TJ of the names of businesses you have collected donations from or bring a list to the G2G with your prizes and make shure one of the mods receives it when you check your prize donations in.  Your cooperation will be greatly appreciated !!!!!!  Thanx Chris"
216126,Spiel,2008-06-16 17:04:00,9065,....Just in from Fishing World and Mike was kind enough to fill a bag full of assorted tackle and stuff for the prize table. Thanks Mike.
216919,ccmtcanada,2008-06-18 18:40:00,7971,TJ...met up with Ryan this afternoon.  I have a rather large box just PACKED with his lures.  He estimates at least a hundred or so in there.  See you Friday around 5 or 6pm.
216929,Roy,2008-06-18 18:53:00,13728,You can make a separate box for me please Cliff.
216932,ccmtcanada,2008-06-18 18:54:00,7971, You got it Roy....shhh...don't tell the boss though.
210750,TJQ,2008-06-04 14:35:00,7806,"Every year on Saturday, I put on a Pike Tourney from noon to 3 pm.  Everyone gets to measure in their best three fish, and I add an inch if they arrive alive..  at around 4 o'clock we gather in the tenting area and we announce the winners..    The winners get to choose a prize pack from the table.  and every year I have had enough prizes so that everyone who enters gets a pick at the table.  In the past couple of years, people have started to bring a prize to put on the table to help me with gathering up all the loot.  Its tough for me to find stuff for that many people, so if you can bring something, its always appreciated.  ALSO....  after we have the prizes, i get cooking the fish of the fish fry, I supply all the plates and napkins, and cutlery, and the fish batter, but if you can bring a salad or something to add to the FOOD table that would be awesome!  Heres a couple of links to last years posts......  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8572  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8560  Lets get the party started....."
210753,TJQ,2008-06-04 14:38:00,7806,Oh ya last years winner... and I think the trophys gonna get bigger this year.. Rick had to add an extra tier... and Ive heard.. hes had his NAME Preprinted as this years winner... that can't be right!!  
210757,lew,2008-06-04 14:49:00,12767,"The Saturday fish-fry is always the hi-light of the trip every year and I must admit, TJ makes just about the best fish batter you'll find anywhere."
210841,ccmtcanada,2008-06-04 17:34:00,7971,Working on some work connections again this year for some prize table stuff!!  I'll talk to Bly about the food thing.
210922,Rich Clemens,2008-06-04 20:23:00,3131,Can't wait.   I'll be doing some shopping in the next couple days and be bringing a bag of goodies to help sweeten the pot a bit.
210941,TJQ,2008-06-04 21:14:00,7806,"Is my wife picking her nose in that picture??? ...lol....  you should pm her and let her know you saw her pick her nose... she will get a kick outta that..  her name is ""Monique""  free OFC hat to the 10th person to PM her....."
210956,Roy,2008-06-04 21:46:00,13728,You're concerned about the woman  ALLEGEDLY picking her nose while you stand in front of the nation hugging Rick????
210958,bigfish1965,2008-06-04 21:49:00,3382,I am very huggable!
210970,JohnF,2008-06-04 22:23:00,3494, I didn't think she was picking -  I thought it looked more like she was just flicking it with her thumb. Heaven only knows what kind of things can become attached to one's nose out in the wilds with fishermen standing all around you. If she wasn't obviously a lady I might have assumed she was just doing the old farmer's (or athlete's) nasal passage clearing.  JF

213188,Spiel,2008-06-09 20:15:00,9065,....I'll certainly be adding something to the prize table.
