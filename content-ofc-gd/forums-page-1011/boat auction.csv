216832,Rizzo,2008-06-18 15:32:00,4754,"Anyone  have experience buying a boat from the auction place on the 400 just south of Barrie? Is it pretty much reliable boats with a lemon or two mixed in, or more lemons with the odd ""diamond in the rough"" mixed in?"
216833,Fisherman,2008-06-18 15:36:00,7201,"If something ends up at an auction, then there may be a reason why it didn't sell before.  Be real careful at that place, I've seen a lot of junk, boats sitting on trailers are sold separate from the trailer, boats that I wouldn't use to plant weeds in, etc. Then beware of the ""bumpers"", those slugs that help bump up the price, anyway, caveat emptor."
216835,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-18 15:40:00,4399,Personally I would never buy anything that I could not hear running unless I could get a written money back guarantee. I always thought of that place as a place that the junk ends up.
216869,Joey,2008-06-18 17:14:00,9122,"Well I only have one of the answers for you, you are nucking futs  I have no information about that auction.  Joey"
216953,misfish,2008-06-18 19:35:00,29133,"BUYER BEWARE.  There are some good things,,,,,,,,,,SOME.Lots of nuck,n crap too.  You buy a boat,then you got to buy the trailer under it. Im surprised they dont auction off the motor seperate aswell."
216960,Rizzo,2008-06-18 19:52:00,4754,"haha...sounds like they've got a few tricks up their sleeve. I just happened to drive by and saw a few respectable-looking boats there (smokercraft, lowe). Like anything in life, I guess if it looks too good to be true it probably is.  Selling the trailer separate is  BIG JOKE. I guess they watch you buy the boat, then some guy ""planted"" in the group drives up the price on the matching trailer...who's responsibility is it then to get your boat off his trailer if you eventually give in!"
217091,pikehunter,2008-06-19 02:04:00,1659,"Same answers every time this subject gets posted on OFC. If you go leave your cash, cards and cheques at home and only go for the entertainment aspect of it."
217286,icefisherman,2008-06-19 17:40:00,952,"Went to that same auction last year. What a waste of my time! Stay away from it. Mostly junk and they are jacking up the prices like you wouldn't believe it...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
