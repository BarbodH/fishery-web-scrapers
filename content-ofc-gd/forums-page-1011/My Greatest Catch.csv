216060,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-16 15:00:00,957,"June 7, 1958   June 7, 2008 after 50 Golden Years   I was hoping to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary with a shore lunch at Table Rock on Little Vermilion Lake, but my wife thought a small family gathering would be appropriate.  Our daughter and two sons insisted on having a bigger bash along Roaring River on my older son's farm in Tennessee.  It was a casual affair on a hot day, so shorts were part of my uniform.  Family members from Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington D.C. joined us in what turned out to be a great weekend.  Here we are with our daughter and two sons.   My sons and brother join me for a shot.   The next day at our house with three generations including the two gals and the guy our children have brought into our family.   My talk came last.  After expressing love for my wife and children I announced plans for visiting my doctor to see about reversing a previous surgical procedure with intentions of increasing our family size.   Unfortunately I have additional obstacles that can't be reversed.   Many other friends joined us including two guys I coached in high school back around 1962.  A couple, who were with us for a seven week fishing trip to Ontario in 1960, delayed their annual season long trip to LOTW so they could join our celebration.  Norma and I are rich with family and friends.  It's been a great 50 years."
