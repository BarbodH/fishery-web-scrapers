216824,EC1,2008-06-18 15:12:00,930,kijiji is full of scams and espeically if they say that the car / boat isnt currently in the area.(and this boat says its in florida  )   i wouldnt trust it that much.
216825,Blue_Axela,2008-06-18 15:12:00,88,Yes.  Its a scam or an ugly divorce settlement.
216837,Pinch,2008-06-18 15:42:00,231," Now why would anyone think that a boat thats for sale in London, located in Florida, with a Wisconsin registration be a scam??!  lol"
216838,anders,2008-06-18 15:46:00,1168,IF you want you can send me 2900 bucks....that way your money that you send away will stay in Ontario...  Definitly a scam....cant see it any other way
216858,ccmtcanada,2008-06-18 16:39:00,7971, With a street address in Toronto.....LOL.
216877,Roy,2008-06-18 17:30:00,13728,"I still can't figure out why anyone would buy anything listed in those rags. I also can't imagine anyone with something good to sell not having enough friends or contacts from whom to buy or sell. If I have something that is no longer useful to me, I'll either give or sell to a friend/neighbour. If I think that selling an item to a friend/neighbour will harm our friendship, then I probably shouldn't be selling it to a stranger either.  It's always worked for me, anyway."
216879,brooks999,2008-06-18 17:32:00,38,"It is listed on the Peterborough Board as well.  I noticed a car add on there by the same poster.....He forgot to change the ""ATT: The boat will be sent from Orlando, FL, USA (3-4 days as time delivery). This is not a local transaction. ""  To Car....  LOL"
216882,cpguy29,2008-06-18 17:39:00,148,"Its a SCAM. Aparently there are some of these ads in the Boat Trader as well, so be careful."
216888,Roy,2008-06-18 17:42:00,13728,"They're all the same. Enter ""autotrader scams"" in your browser and I'll bet you get 2 million hits."
216891,Canuck2fan,2008-06-18 17:47:00,1444,I found it funny that someone had a walleye boat in Florida..... Maybe they fish for walleye there but it doesn't strike me as walleye country..... Now if he had of said bass boat my cheque would have been in the mail. (not saying it wouldn't have bounced though)
