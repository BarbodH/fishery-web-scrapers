You can never have enough of that stuff around - if the don't find ya handsome, they should at least find ya handy! 2. Put your cooler in your freezer the night before you leave... your ice will last 2-3 times as long as it won't be used up cooling off the cooler! Have a blast folks! I wish I could come, but family life and family tickets to ""Walking with dinosaur's"" on Saturday have put the ix nay on any travel! HH"

216798,Rich Clemens,2008-06-18 13:51:00,3131,"I think it is just you.  My wife does all the packing - clothes, food, everything except the boat and fishing gear.   All I have to do is haul it out of the house and load up the truck.   My work is now complete today.  As soon as she gets home from 1/2 of work .... WE BE OFF TO LAKAIR.   T minus 3 hours and counting."
216765,blaque,2008-06-18 12:24:00,2419," Ive got a cousin like you, he usually ends up giving me that extra half hour to an hour to check and double check everything while waiting for him the morning of a trip lol. So there is an underlying advantage to his ways. He always shows up with a round of timmies and an apology for everyone waiting HEHE  Do you by any chance go out drinking the night before and sleep the whole ride to the cabin as well LOL"
