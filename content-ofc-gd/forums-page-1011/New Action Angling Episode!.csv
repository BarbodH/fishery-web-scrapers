215601,mikeymikey,2008-06-15 00:52:00,376,Thanks for the video.  May I give you a tip ? Since you took some time to upload your video... why not use the YouTube?  Not just any format but High Quality Video Format for Youtube.  http://youtube.com/watch?v=VT11GGD7qlI
215608,jace,2008-06-15 01:29:00,472,"wow.  don't see many catches as fine as that one.  Not only does she fish but she gets in the water, handles the fish, and unhooks them herself."
215609,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-15 01:29:00,2585,good stuff!  CHEERS!
215636,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-15 03:07:00,2050,Duuuude - is it just me or did Candice whop your ass? haha  Good job guys.  Cheers

216106,Rich,2008-06-16 16:32:00,3927," I tried to use Youtube before in the past, it always wouldn't let me upload anything over a 10 min video. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems Youtube only allows short videos?  Thanks for the comments though, everybody!"
216148,bassjnkie,2008-06-16 17:27:00,1101,"Great video, WTG!! Nice carp!! You tube would be better, there is a way to put long video, but I can't figure it out either.  Great job!! Daniel OCH"
216278,mepps,2008-06-16 23:56:00,1301,nicely done guys!  Have you tried vimeo.com?
216353,wolfville,2008-06-17 03:58:00,396,"Rich, did you actually put corns on your hook? How come only Candice caught all the big girls?  Nice work! Thanks for the video, I bet you there are people in the world who would pay a lot of money to fish that spot...."
216426,splashhopper,2008-06-17 13:43:00,2931,nice report Rich. 
216442,RobHall,2008-06-17 14:16:00,261," FYI,  You can no longer upload videos longer than ten minutes regardless of what type of account you have. Users who had previously been allowed to upload longer content still retain this ability, so you may occasionally see videos that are longer than ten minutes. The ten minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube realized that the majority of videos over this length were from television shows and films.  Cheers,  FOTB"
216699,Rich,2008-06-18 02:04:00,3927," Yeah, always have just put corn on the hook.. lol no idea how to use a hair rig still. My attempts at tying them fail every time! I have successfully used the pre-tied ones with doughballs ONCE. haha  And Candice always catches the biggest fish, that's why I prefer leaving her at home. LOL jk"
217042,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-19 00:27:00,3761,"That was a pretty good show, a little windy at times. It is good that there was always fish being caught.  WTG, hope to see some Bass videos in the summer if you will do any."
