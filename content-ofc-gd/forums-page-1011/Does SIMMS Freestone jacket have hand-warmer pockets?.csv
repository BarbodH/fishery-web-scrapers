216338,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-17 02:38:00,0,"The reason why I ask is that none of websites say it has hand-warmer pockets, even www.simmsfishing.com"
216349,mbac31,2008-06-17 03:27:00,904,MIne has them.
216369,Roy,2008-06-17 09:23:00,13728,"This is the product description.  ""When the weather is just a bit cooler down by the lake or stream and a lighter-weight jacket is in order, this packable 2.5-layer lightweight wading jacket is just what you need. It's equipped with two large chest pockets for fly boxes and other items, and there are handwarmer pockets to give your fingers a place to recover from exposure to chilly water. Adjustable neoprene cuffs keep water out of the sleeves. Imported."""
216862,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-18 16:48:00,0,Just got a confirmation from SIMMs that curreny (new) Freestone jacket does NOT have hand-warmers ... damn!
216907,Canuck2fan,2008-06-18 18:16:00,1444,"OK so why would they do that? Maybe because waders generally have them? You might be able to find old stock of the ones that do have a warmer pocket though if that is a deal breaker. Just call and ask before you order, and write in any order you make on the web in the comments or special instruction window that most websites have."
