BM"

216573,Musky or Specks,2008-06-17 19:30:00,2710,Man that sucks. My condolences for the loss. My 30hp stays outside but my 15 and my siw both sit on stands in the garage because I thought they would be to easy to steal. I grew up in a fairly seedy area and dont trust anyone.
216574,doubleheader,2008-06-17 19:34:00,497,Have you checked your homeowners insurance? It may cover. Really sorry for you loss. Hope the jerk(s) get caught.
216575,johnnyb,2008-06-17 19:40:00,3413,That is garbage...sorry to hear it.
216578,Reef Runner,2008-06-17 19:42:00,981,"I second that I hope those jerks get caught, sent to prison amd endure at least 5 years of the Pe-anal system.  sotos.  I take my 9.9 off and into the garage every weekend.  It would be nice not to hassle, but there are some real slimeballz still around."
216585,Roy,2008-06-17 19:50:00,13728,Motors under 25hp are usually covered by home policy.
216586,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 20:02:00,135,That blows.  Sorry to hear about your loss.  Don't trust anyone.  Lesson learned.
216587,Bassman27,2008-06-17 20:03:00,98,"I wish I had some Roy, but unfortunately due to past medical issues and bad times my family and I lost our house and now live in a small apt. building and don't have insurance on home  belongings.I don't believe or have alot of faith in the police being able to do anything as I know they're busy with alot of things on the go but figured I'd put in a report anyway.Hopin against hope!!"
216593,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-17 20:18:00,1351,"sorry to hear that. but when i used to have a 20hp, i used one of these locks and never had problems. what did you use? a pad lock through the holes? "
216596,Musky or Specks,2008-06-17 20:23:00,2710,^^ thats what I have on my 30.
216602,Spiel,2008-06-17 20:39:00,9065,"....Brutal, always said there's nothing lower than stealing another man's property."
216611,Musky or Specks,2008-06-17 20:57:00,2710,Im sure its hard earned property as well. Not that stealing from the rich should be condoned either.
216627,limeyangler,2008-06-17 21:42:00,5204,"My blood boils to hear that...low down, Sorry for your loss.  Simon."
216629,Black_Blade,2008-06-17 21:49:00,258, Talk to an insurance agent...I'm pretty sure you can have content insurance etc for living in apartments.  Sorry about the loss
216630,Clampet,2008-06-17 21:54:00,1947,"A few years ago an outfitter out of Belleville, ON (Bay of Quinte) got ripped off for 9 or ten (I cannot re-call) brand new 9.9 HP Johnson motors that were on the back of the 14' rental boats.  He replaced some of them and apparently it happened a second time. He had the motors secured by some type of locking device that was somehow compromised by the savvy thieves.  He never got them back."
216664,duber,2008-06-18 00:12:00,220,Sorry to hear that.  I will keep my ears open for a cheap 9.9 Merc. in the area.
216668,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-18 00:33:00,2585,that sucks big time.
216695,oxcowboy,2008-06-18 02:01:00,544,"sorry to hear this,  it just blows my mind what some people will do.  i would love to see them cained on national tv.  now that would be a reality show i could really get into.  jason"
216700,Mattones,2008-06-18 02:07:00,587,Thats horrible mate. Hope these buggers get caught.
216705,Tinman,2008-06-18 02:18:00,376,"I know you can get tennants insurance,, and if you do it through the company your car is, its only a few bucks a month extra, good luck"
216727,Sinker,2008-06-18 03:23:00,8692,There is nothing worse than a thief!!!!  That sucks man......I feel for ya!!  Sinker
216730,holdfast,2008-06-18 03:27:00,1813,"Its too bad we never seem to catch them in action,  I have daydreamed many times how I would traumatize the culprit.  Last year someone broke into my garage and broke the window of my car but stole nothing.  Didn't make sense as the door was unlocked"
216735,bucktail,2008-06-18 03:43:00,1857,Sorry dude. Same thing happened to me . Not cool
216759,Victor,2008-06-18 11:22:00,1609,"Sorry to hear man. I hope that you'll find the jerks one day ... if not, karma will."
216761,Meegs,2008-06-18 12:14:00,249,That is NOT a good way to start the fishing season!    Sorry to hear that!    im not sure if this helps or not for future refference but i know when I used to rent an apartment i looked into house contents insurrance...   it turned out that i got  10% off my auto insurance if i got the home insurance.   the home insurance was pretty cheap already but with the 10% off i think my monthly payments where only within $5 of what i was paying before.    worth looking into anyways!  hope you find your motor!
