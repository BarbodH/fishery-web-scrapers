We're leaving this saturday for the area for our week long houseboat trip and I'm looking for a local shop to pick up a map, some bait and hopefully some tips  I've never been to the area and dont know where any places are.  Ryan  (saturday can't come soon enough.... been waiting for this trip for a long time now)"
216729,Dabluz,2008-06-18 03:26:00,701,"I haven't been to Gananoque in quite a few years but I'm positive that there are a few bait and tackle stores there.  There may even be a Canadian Tire store there too.  One thing for sure, there are a lot of boats and a lot of fishermen in that area.  I wouldn't be worried in the least.  Same thing for maps of all kinds....this town is invaded by tourists who come by car or boat every year.  Do some internet searchs with the word ""Gananoque"" and I'm sure you will get tons of info and even the e-mail address of a tourist information bureau."
216762,cranks bait,2008-06-18 12:18:00,721,"https://www.stlawrenceoutfitters.com/xlsws_...ndex.php?c=root These guys are about 5-10 minutes east of Gan.  They supply my habit really well.  They are in contact with locals and can tell you a few spots to hit.  There is a Canadian Tire in Gan as well, but do not know what they have.  I'm 30 minutes east of gan and have a few spots I could share if you are going to be closer to Brockville. The St. Lawrence is a great place to cruise around.  Make sure to see as much as you can."
217008,SBCregal,2008-06-18 22:29:00,688,"cool, thanks  any idea on water temps in the area? still pretty low like most places?"
217166,cranks bait,2008-06-19 12:35:00,721,"Was out last night.  The suface is 61 degrees Far, that is.  I've been catching pike anywhere from 2-10 feet of water.  Eyes about 25-40 feet.  Stupid bass (that is until the season opens) are everywhere.  Lures of choice right now are Husky Jerks for casting 5 1/2"".  Tail dancers and deep reef runners for trolling.  Are you getting a little aluminum to scoot around in, or just the house boat?"
217175,cranks bait,2008-06-19 12:54:00,721,"Can't see my post, but I think I forgot to mention that there are Hydroplane boat races going on here Saturday, if you canvince the group to go for a boat ride.  Be fun to watch out on the water."
217186,NAC,2008-06-19 13:25:00,369,"  Would it be too much paddling to fish there in a kayak? any suggestions as to where to put in near Gan?  I'm more into pike and walleye, but not opposed to bass. I'll be to the outlaws in Lansdowne next weekend and am looking for excuses to disappear for extended periods of time.  thanks in advance!"
217197,cranks bait,2008-06-19 13:36:00,721,"You could do it in a yak.  If you are in Lansdowne, go to Caigers or ivy lea to launch.  Both are on the parkway.  Keep in mind that there will be heavy boat traffic in the area.  All around Grenadeire Island is good for pike.  If you are going in the Kayak you might even want to go to Landons bay for pike.  Again it is on the Parkway going towards Gan.  You can park at the bridge and launch right there."
217315,SBCregal,2008-06-19 19:03:00,688,cranks...thanks for all the info  we'll have my buddys 14 footer/25hp boat towed behind the houseboat so we can be out fishing while the ladies do what they do.  hydroplane races eh? any idea whereabouts or will i be able to find em pretty easy by the noise  heh
217368,cranks bait,2008-06-19 21:38:00,721,Races are right here in Brockville.  I wish I had the day off to go see them.  My boss is such a hard     depending on where you are on the boat you could zip down.  Might be easier to get back to the car then drive.
