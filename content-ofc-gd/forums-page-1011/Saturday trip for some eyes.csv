216458,rickster,2008-06-17 14:50:00,495,"Well we decided to head out to one of our favorite walleye lakes on saturday Myself, the wife, her dad and brother, our son and two nephews (needless to say we needed two boats) Managed to get out of the yard and 10:30 and got to the start of the trail to the lake at eleven Here is a shot of the start of the trail   And another of the trail a little farther in   Finally a view of the promised land LOL   We had to shuttle the boats in with one half ton truck as the father in laws new chevy didnt have the ground clearance to get through this   So we waited patiently for the other boat to get in    Finally after getting loaded up we head out.  Unfortunately we are in the slower boat   On the way to our first spot I told my son I was going to outfish him and this is the response I got   We stopped at a little island on our way to the honey hole to see if we could pick anything up and of course my son gets the first fish   Couldnt get anything else so we heaed over to the others to fish with them   We did really well but struggled to get small enough fish to keep for supper.  Slot size is 13.8 to 17.7"" and we were getting most of the fish 18-22"" Here is my best of the day 21.5""   Suppertime came way to fast so we decided to head home with a meal     BOY I HOPE NO ONE RECOGNIZES THAT TREE All in all a really good day out with some family  Hope to get back out there next weekend as there are some huge muskie in that lake as well as some smallies We did get a couple sm aroung 19-20"" but they were released without pics "

216666,Clampet,2008-06-18 00:22:00,1947,"Wow, looks like a real isolated spot! I suppose there may be other access points but it looks great.  Hard to beleive a new truck doesn't have the ground clearance fer that little (?) puddle.  Really nice fish too by the way."
216780,rickster,2008-06-18 13:11:00,495,  Anytime you wanna come down I would be glad to take you out there.   Of course you would have to wear a blindfold on the ride in
216790,Reef Runner,2008-06-18 13:29:00,981,Nice report Rickster.  Beauty spot up there.  You and your son have a healthy rivalry
