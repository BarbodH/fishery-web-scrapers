216665,Stoty,2008-06-18 00:16:00,2910,"I just got word today that my current employment contract will not be renewed and will end next Friday. Nice of them to do to me when just 2 weeks ago I was told that I would be pretty much guaranteed to be extended until at least August, with the strong possibility of being hired into a permanent position.  Needless to say, they gave me a LITTLE less notice then they said they would in the case of my contract not being renewed.  Anyone know of a place who is looking for a Web Developer?? Or anyone need a website done?  Any help is much appreciated."

There is an art to getting yourself noticed on this site so have a good read through other peoples profiles, and also do a search about linkedin techniques.  Once you get rolling on this site, opportunities will find you pretty quick, it's not like monsterosity or work-o-polis"
216694,bigfish1965,2008-06-18 01:59:00,3382,"Stoty; I was offered a position at the casino as a web development manager which I turned down cause it was contract. It is still running as an internal position, but likely will go public next week. Keep an eye on the website for fallsviewcasinoresort.com and see if it comes up. Sounds like a cool gig...more about developing then actually building anything and marketting. I've had 3 web job offers from the states in the last few months, but oddly enough nothing in Canada has been coming around. I've been slow myself, but PM me and I can get you some side stuff and probably some maintenance stuff for me."

My brother is disabled and was with the government for 2.75 years, at 3 years they must make you permanent full time, they laid him off 2 weeks before the deadline."
