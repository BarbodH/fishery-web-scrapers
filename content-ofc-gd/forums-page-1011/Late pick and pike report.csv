217451,Master of Bait,2008-06-20 01:59:00,196,"Fishin' guys and gals,  Here's a late report for you from a trip I took in May with my buddy.  It was about a week after the opener and, sadly, it's the only time I've been able to get out this year for these two species.  My reports are always really late as I can't bring my digital on the boat and am relegated to using disposables - gotta fill 'em up, then get 'em developed, takes some time, y'know?  Anyway, we had a great day on our favorite lake.  Caught about 50 fish between the two species trolling cranks (mostly shad raps) in 15 feet, my favorite way to fish.  Nothing of any size but still lots of action.  Here's some pice for ya...  First fish of the day, chunky little walleye   Second fish of the day, my buddy Steve gets a chunkiER little walleye   Also, here are a couple of average sized pike for that lake.    Bonus white bass shot from lake O for ya.  Good times.     Cheers,  MOB"

217503,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-20 11:08:00,0,Nice pics. Sounds like you were slayin em! Thanks for sharing!
217509,Victor,2008-06-20 11:39:00,1609,Nice fish MoB! There are some really cheap digital cameras to be had nowadays ... even the normal point and shoot dcams have like 8-9 megapixels now ... I'm pretty sure you can find one @ 4-5 megapixels under $100 ... makes a great camera for fishing and you can view them right away
