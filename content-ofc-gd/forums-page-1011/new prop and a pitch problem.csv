I lost my propeller on lake biscotasi last year, just happenened to be at the farthest end of the lake away from my camping spot before sunset, yadda yadda, long story!!   I purchased a new one last week and installed it to manufacturers specifications. The motor is a 1994 9.9 johnson and the pitch of the prop I purchased was a 10 pitch.. So i start the motor for the first time this season and it fires up effortlessly as usual. Slip it into gear and away I go..I noticed at half throttle the engine was revving higher than usual. After a  few seconds maybe 10, the motor kicked in and the I could feel the boat glide into what I feel is normal full throttle behaviour. For the entire evening my baby performed poorly for me on start up as described but ran smoothly for me at full throttle.. Could this be something to do with an impropper pitch??"

217096,Cast-Away,2008-06-19 02:13:00,790,It sounds to me like a fuel problem. Did you have old gas in the tank or was the motor not winterized and run dry?
217100,boatman,2008-06-19 02:24:00,350,"What was your hole shot like? Over-reving sounds like a pitch issue. However, 10 p sounds about right. Do you remember your old pitch and diameter? Did you replace with a new prop or a used one?"
217125,sturgman,2008-06-19 04:29:00,249,"Thanks guys...Im not sure how I lost the other prop as I was only letting the dog out to run and have a pee on an island..When I pushed off and started the motor it wouldnt move. Lifted the motor and just about lost it!!!  No rocks were hit that weekend, the prop was just not there..  The lost prop was an original to the motor so im unsure what the pitch was.. I purchased the prop new and it clearly stated on the box that it was rated for my motor with a 10 pitch so i bought it..Also, I was using fresh gasoline and the motor is always stored indoors during off season.. When I get back to the cottage I will maybe snap a few pics or even take the prop off and re-install it agin.."
