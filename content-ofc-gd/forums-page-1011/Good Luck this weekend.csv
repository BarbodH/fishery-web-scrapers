216828,Reef Runner,2008-06-18 15:25:00,981,"Good luck to everyone this weekend, especially to those heading or at Lakair.  What are your plans?  As for myself, I hadn't the opportunity to do much fishing this year because of the LSAT exam.  I wrote that sucker on Monday and so LET THE GAMES BEGIN.  Going to be headed to the cottage and get some needed inches for TEAM 9  Bringing a bud with me, who never fished in his life.  Gotta get him his liscnce tonite. So I'll be coaching, captaining and casting.  Also, with the gracious offer of Barnie's Band of Gold, I will be testing out Ryan Landry's Black Lures.  Look for a the expirement write up and report upon my return.  Goodluck folks,  reefrunner"
