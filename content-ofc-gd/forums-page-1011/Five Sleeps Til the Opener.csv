216326,Doctrt,2008-06-17 02:08:00,141,Anyone getting out on G-Bay for some real muskie fishing this Saturday??  I personally can't wait!!  Thought this might be a good forum to discuss different strategies that might be used in the colder water of the north.  Any thoughts??  Here's a big girl from a few years back    Good Luck to all!!  T
216332,Musky or Specks,2008-06-17 02:27:00,2710,Nice Fish. I leave Friday Morning cant wait!!!!!!! I'll use strategy I always use. Do my milk run once with bulging bucktail. Second time with topwater. Third time with Sledge. See if anything shows itself and comeback to those spots more frequently and cautiously.
216347,brickNblock,2008-06-17 03:21:00,598, Ive never trolled a sledge before..... Please explain...only have casted and WTD or variations of it. Your milk run..???? you actually trolling or is it a locale you park/drift and cast to?? Just curious?????  Hhey docT.......nice serious looking lunge bud!.......Id be very anxious myself to get back up to GB for some of that. Best of luck to you.
216354,BabyHerc,2008-06-17 04:01:00,285," A milk-run is a set of likely spots with great potential that have given up fish in the past.  Have 5 or more of these spots within running distance, then hit each in succession with different presentations each time, and you have yourself a milk-run."
216355,Musky or Specks,2008-06-17 04:03:00,2710,What he said. only about 8 spots for me.
216360,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 04:54:00,135,Good luck.  I wish I knew your spots.
216371,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-17 10:38:00,0,Very Impressive Musky! Good luck on the opener!
216377,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-17 11:02:00,1362,"I can't sleep, I'm so pumped for the Muskie opener this Friday on the Ottawa  .....it seems as though it's taking forever for the day to get here!!!"
216390,Reef Runner,2008-06-17 11:53:00,981,Very nice fish.  I can't wait to get up there.
216394,Seaweed,2008-06-17 12:16:00,135,The Ottawa River opens for Muskie this weekend also.  Up here we fast troll spinner baits on the flats until the weeds make that impossible.  I will be burning up a few gallons using this technique this weekend.  Best of luck to everyone .... hang on tight to those rods.
216409,Raf,2008-06-17 12:49:00,3495,"yeah, it's going to be one long week.  not sure i'll be able to sleep friday  might have to start at midnite."

216810,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-18 14:27:00,0,"  Sounds like the way the post went when it was posted....  I fish GB but wouldnt go as far as saying it's the ""REAL Musky"" opener....  ............Good luck regardless. I think I'll wait for a few weeks before targeting them. The Dinner fishing is still HOT!(Pickerel that is) Im sure the big gilrs would look better with food in their gut as well....."
