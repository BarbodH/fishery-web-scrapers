Brake lights work, running lights work, left turn signal works!!! I can't figure out why it won't work. HELP anything is appriciated Thanks Scooter"
216821,bow slayer,2008-06-18 15:07:00,1074,sounds like a bulb either on trailer or on vehicle.
216823,yellowboat,2008-06-18 15:12:00,211,Check the ground to the right light
216836,Fisherman,2008-06-18 15:41:00,7201,"Are the brake lights separate from the turn signals? If not, then it may be a faulty flasher, weak ground on that side or a bad connection at the light or where you spliced wires."
216871,wallyboss,2008-06-18 17:21:00,1095,99% of trailer light issues are bad grounds. Check that first!!!!
216909,Canuck2fan,2008-06-18 18:22:00,1444,"Someone beat me too it... as my dad who has been an auto mechanic for 56 years has always said..... CHECK THE GROUND first it is the fastest, cheapest test and will usually solve your problem.  What used to be really funny though was watching my uncle (electrician) and my dad arguing about that.... My uncle who was used to AC just couldn't grasp the need for a good ground on a car all the time for some reason."
216994,Sharpie,2008-06-18 21:45:00,1,Test your connection at the vehicle first. If the vehicle has seperate signal light from the brake lights there is a convertor box and sometimes the box goes bad when you test the lights after replacing them. Hope this helps...Good luck John
217254,Scott S,2008-06-19 16:29:00,203,Your right John;  I took it up to hitch city where I had it installed. They checked the converter box and thats where the problem was. Replaced the converter and everything is just ducky. Really like the LED lights. Thanks Scooter
