Anyway, I got $150 gift certificate from Natural Sports...the local tackle shop....anyway, i needed a new spinning combo, i had been using one that was 14 years old and falling apart, the other was a $20 ready to fish combo from Walmart..anyway, i picked up:  6'6"" 2 pc, medium action Shimano Convergence rod and a Shimano Soltace 2000 reel...  I also bought my dad a ready to fish Daiwa combo...he hasn't been out fishing in years...i think i was 15 or 16 the last time we really went fishing together and he hasn't had a good rod and reel since his last one fell apart 10 years ago. So we're not going very far, back to some old stomping grounds we used to be successful with the toothy critters. I hope we can hook in to a few. It would be nice for him to catch something, especially after all he's been through."
