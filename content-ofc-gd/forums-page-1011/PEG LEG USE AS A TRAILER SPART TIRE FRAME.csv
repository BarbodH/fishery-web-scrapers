216101,yellowboat,2008-06-16 16:20:00,211,My bad not the same thing you were talking about.
216114,ccmtcanada,2008-06-16 16:58:00,7971,"This is the only reference I can find about a product called ""peg leg"" and trailers.....  http://www.trailersentry.com/products.html"
216181,bbog,2008-06-16 18:41:00,665,I wasn't really paying attention when YET ANOTHER infomercial was being run on WFN. But to me it appeared that this product was being used as a spare wheel. They showed a wheel being taken off the trailer then this gadget being attached to the frame of the trailer behind where the original wheel was.  Only reason I could think of using this would be if the axle had some type of problem that could not take the spare - otherwise just put on the spare.  Like I said I wasn't really paying attention but that is what I got out of it.
216242,tjsa,2008-06-16 22:37:00,1578,"OH!!!!!!!!!!!...........THATS what those things are for,  I bought a small utility trailer for my quad from CTC, and it came with those, but in the trailer documentation, it did not mention their purpose."
216243,forrest,2008-06-16 22:44:00,1032, $150!!! OMG!
216319,CRAPPIE,2008-06-17 01:37:00,213,"Barnie's Ban, you are right, that what peg leg is used for when a spare tire cannot put in the damaged axle,, do you know how can I find where I can buy or the link? Thanks!"
216656,CRAPPIE,2008-06-17 23:27:00,213,Bump
216663,forrest,2008-06-17 23:54:00,1032, If WFN advertised it.  Imagine how thrilled the advertiser would be if WFN put you in contact with them: http://www.wfn.tv/contact/  forrest
216708,bucktail,2008-06-18 02:52:00,1857,Too bad it wasnt Heather Mills leg!
216830,LeXXington,2008-06-18 15:32:00,1928,  Yeap but think about it you can NOT cut through the peg..  now cutting through steel bolts holding it on thats another issue
216857,Bernie,2008-06-18 16:30:00,3190,"For a $150 you could buy a couple sets of new bearings and seals (which should be checked anyway) and a spare tire. Peg leg seems like a crutch fix to me. Oh ya, you would still need to repair the axle/bearings and possibly the tire too if you let it go too long. More $$$$$$$ to spend. Preventative maintainence is still best."
