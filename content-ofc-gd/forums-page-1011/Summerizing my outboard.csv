217586,mattyk,2008-06-20 15:06:00,2110,I have a small 15hp merc 4 stroke engine. I winterized it last year by my self. Now I will be summerizing it. Can anybody reccomend what needs to be done? Or do you know of any good websites that outline the process. I am trying to save some cash by doing it myself this year. THanks.

Maybe install a new fuel filter, thats about it."

Sometimes the burning off of the fogging oil can fowl a plug on ya. don't forget to replace the lower unit gear oil as well. Even if you put new oil in to winterize it. I find a new fill up or at a mininum a top up is required for peace of mind. Grease the prop shaft as well."
