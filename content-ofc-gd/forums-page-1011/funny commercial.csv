When you get to the home page clik on watch the commercial I'm not sure if the link will work but if you type out the info you should get on the site  http://www.lakemaidbeer.com"

199943,grt1,2008-05-11 18:19:00,638,"I thought there would be more hits and replies on this post. maybe some guys don't like commercials but at least check out the lakeside beer model that are on the site. And, just for the record, I had never heard of this beer before I saw the web page on a manitoba fishing site. I don't work for the company. I just enjoy good humour."

217411,glirw,2008-06-20 00:16:00,200,"""Great Fishermen need Great Beer"" is their slogan.  Well seeing as I am not a great fisherman I'll stick to Lakeport?"
217420,Fisherman,2008-06-20 01:06:00,7201,"Miss Walleye, do I eat it or put it back so she can spawn some more."
217429,maybe,2008-06-20 01:25:00,307,"Never seen the beer in person, but it's been linked off Rapala's site for some time.  I'm more excited about the new Rapala Choir.  Bet they could make a 6"" perch feel like a new PB!"
