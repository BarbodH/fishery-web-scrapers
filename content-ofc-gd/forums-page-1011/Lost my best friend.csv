216999,Big Cliff,2008-06-18 21:57:00,6899,"Gary, I am so sorry to hear of Amy's passing. I remember about a year ago when it was touch and go for a while and we all breathed a sigh of relief when she pulled through. I guess God just needed another special dog too much this time! Keep strong my friend and keep her memories alive in your heart."
217000,Hookset,2008-06-18 21:58:00,367,"That's pretty rough for sure. Sorry to hear about a lost friend. Dogs make the best friends. I'll give my old guy a hug in her memory. My buddy is on his last legs too, he has a disease which deteriorates the nerve leading from the spine to his hips / legs. He can barely walk but is in zero pain. When he can't get up anymore it'll be time to say goodbye. I figure he has a couple months at best. Life can be a real carp at times. Just remember the good times you had, they will outweigh the sadness.  God Bless,  Hookset."
