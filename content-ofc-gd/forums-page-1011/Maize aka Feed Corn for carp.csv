217317,Rich,2008-06-19 19:07:00,3927,"I bought 20lbs of this stuff from the local feed store in hopes of saving money on carp bait this season.  I boiled the stuff in a brown sugar/sugar solution I normally use for frozen corn, however after 20 minutes of boiling it still stayed hard as a rock, and cracked when I attempted to rig it.  Is there a better way to soften this corn? Hope I didn't waste my time buying this stuff to end up feeding it to the birds, LOL"
217359,JohnF,2008-06-19 20:37:00,3494, Didn't they say to let it soak for 48 hours after the initial boil?  JF

217405,bassjnkie,2008-06-20 00:08:00,1101,"2 ways.  1. pressure cooker. Put 1/4 corn in the cooker and 3/4 water and sugar. When the valve pops, let it boil for 30mins, no more. Run it under cold water till the lock releases and put it in a bucket with the boiled water.  2. Let corn soak for 24hrs in water, boil for 1-2hrs, don't let it crack open. Place in bucket with boiled/flavored water. Done.  3. Big Bob's corn at Fishing World, great bait for right on the hook. Mussel and banana work great in Dover.  4. Use a hair rig  http://hairrig.ontariocarphunters.com/  Maize is hard to use as a bait right on the hook. But if you follow on of these steps, you will be ok.  Hope this helps Daniel OCH"

217507,Victor,2008-06-20 11:27:00,1609,"I have yet to have that happened to me yet ... last season I boiled them for about 45-60minutes and they soften up real good, rarely had any of them crack. When I put it on my hair though, I usually try to find the better kernels.  This year I've been soaking'em ... the bucket that I soaked back in early May still got leftover lol ... it's fermenting real good but the carp don't seem to have a problem with them ... it might be even better ... who doesn't like free alcohol 8-) haha"
