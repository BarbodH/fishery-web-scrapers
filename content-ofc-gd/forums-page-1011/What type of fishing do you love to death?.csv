215158,Burning Babies,2008-06-13 15:19:00,150,"I've fished largemouth bass longer, and am far better at catching them, than any other species, so I'd have to go with them.  When I'm catching fish though, I'm just as happy to fish for smallmouth, walleye, northers, or muskie."
215185,Rich,2008-06-13 16:54:00,3927,"I try to avoid my history of being a bass fisherman.. but this year I really miss it. Largemouth for me, what can I say, once an addict always an addict."
215198,anders,2008-06-13 17:22:00,1168,"Salmon fishing in the great lakes....I am yet to find a species that fights so hard and powerful than Chinook.  The gear you use for them and the power they have to handle you like we are jello gets my heart pumping everytime.  There is nothing more than seeing that rod pop out of the downrigger,  seeing your rod double over while yor reel is screaming that sweet sound, and not knowing how big of fish you have on the end.  It says something when you saw ""oh, just a small one...about 10lbs or so....LOL....I LOVE IT!!!!!!"
215305,JohnF,2008-06-13 22:08:00,3494,"Anything I haven't already tried, and there are lots of fish I haven't caught yet. The second time around it's still good.  JF"
215320,kuhaman,2008-06-13 23:10:00,503,"I love to fish for walleye. I spend quite a bit of time in northern Ontario and it probably has as much to do with the solitude and scenery as it does the fish. Still, walleyes get my vote."

215422,jwl,2008-06-14 04:59:00,1056,"I love the adventures of winter steelie fishing the Niagara in the boat from about December until it starts to get warm, also many trips spent on foot hiking around for steelies and big lakers.  Late fall, early spring pike action where there are lots of 10lbs plus fish in the mix  I love trying my hand a musky fishing throughout the year as well,fall is my favorite time for that...that's generally when the big ones come out at the places I fish for them  All this is in no particular order, I just like fishing for big fish"
215425,jace,2008-06-14 06:50:00,472,"i'm happiest when i'm fishing, and that means anything at all.   it doesn't matter if it's a big fight, no fight, soaking a bobber, or jigging a sabiki rig.   I grew up on a lake catching big pike, perch, and walleye so i got hooked on fishing from a very early age.   I have to say i prefer any kind of fishing where i'm casting when i have a choice.  or maybe i just think that because it helps fuel my addiction to getting the latest greatest gizmo rods and reels.  What i would like to try is tuna fishing, and i mean big  tuna,  like 1000#"
215479,Squid,2008-06-14 14:12:00,1656,Has to be musky for me also. Nothing freaks you out more than a 46+ inch fish hitting your figure 8!!! They come out of thin air to hit the lure!! The anticipation for the hit is tremendous.
216561,pokerdemon4,2008-06-17 19:09:00,135,Fly fishing for atlantic salmon and char was my favourite.  Now its musky fishing.  Both are pretty damn fun.
216981,ecmilley,2008-06-18 21:04:00,2163,I love fishing for just about anything but I have to say my favorite fishing is playing hooky from work fishing regardless of species
190408,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-04-21 18:03:00,1362, you and I should get together sometime this year for a lil outing...Specks or Muskie...doesn't really matter!!
190409,Hookset,2008-04-21 18:04:00,367,"Smallies or Buckets, either one and I'm happy. Surface bait fishing and spinnerbaits are my faves but that surface action is probably what got me addicted so many years ago.  Chug bugs...cast it...pop...pop...pop.. WHOOSH !!!!  Oh God, how many more days ?   Hookset."
190420,Musky or Specks,2008-04-21 18:27:00,2710,"Before they changed opening day of Musky this year I use to have this sweet gig where I would flyfish specks the Friday morning in  a northern river, boat into a remote musky lake. Portage my motor and camping equipment. Get out for an evening walleye fish and fry and then Musky fish for the next three days. Was the sweetest combo gig I knew. Now it'll have to be just the walleye and musky."

190511,Handlebarz,2008-04-21 21:59:00,3790,I think I have fished most fish in my area and loved them all but I was bitten by the musky bug I think 4 years ago and have not looked back since all I think about is slime talk about is slime and even when I am sitting out side or passing by some water I can smell that sweet slime. Yep Musky has me going BIG TIME all others are just bait from june till Dec.
190512,Musky or Specks,2008-04-21 22:02:00,2710,"Yes sweet sweet slime. Havent been able to get slimed down your way yet Ive been four times now , I like it I wish it was closer."

190521,Canuck2fan,2008-04-21 22:12:00,1444,"I can't choose just one..... in no particular order I love the challenge of winter fishing bows and steelies, battling the conditions as much as the fish. I enjoy salmon fishing off the piers in the fall never knowing what you are going to get. I thrive on bassing that pace of a fish every 5 minutes or so and the light gear while seeing all the latest beach ""fashions"" that the ladies are wearing is always blast.... Fishing for perch all summer on a pier full of great characters is more of a social event than anything and the pay off of delicious tasty fish is just a bonus. In between perching and the end of bows in the rivers I insist on one or two days ""garbage"" fishing where I keep going till I catch a northern, carp and two or three types of catfish, and I have had some great times doing that.  Yep I guess I am hooked...."

191141,danc,2008-04-23 00:24:00,4677,"To me there's no thrill quite like catching a wild Brook Trout out of crystal clear water in late August or early September. The colors will blow you away, and it's beauty, quite simply, can't be matched IMHO."
191328,jjcanoe,2008-04-23 12:48:00,744,I had to go with trout/steelhead option but that is a pretty vague category.  Small stream Brook trout are my gamefish of choice and don't have much luck in the boat for their big brothers (cousins)  Bass fishing is coming up as second place  jjcanoe
191357,tdotfisherman,2008-04-23 13:48:00,317,"I love all types of fishing to death.. but at this point, I would probably say my favourite type of fishing would be for Northern Pike up in our northern lakes, because they grow big, are extremely active preditors, and they love to smash top-water lures as well, making for explosive strikes!"

190218,jediangler,2008-04-21 11:13:00,1923,I voted for musky. But it has to be in a kayak for me to love it to death.
190219,wuchikubo,2008-04-21 11:14:00,1114,Anything that's willing to co-operate on the bite as I'm usually limited to how often and how long I can fish.
190227,ccmtcanada,2008-04-21 11:28:00,7971,"I picked steelhead, but it really depends on the time of year.  Going after steelhead in the tribs in July just wont happen.  For fall, winter (when possible) and early spring, it's steelies.  I love going after walleye and muskie in the fall, pike and carp in the spring, and bass in the hot days of summer when other fish are harder to catch."

190239,Garry2Rs,2008-04-21 11:56:00,1425,"For several years, after I arrived in the Kawarthas, I considered everything except Musky to be bait! However, I have converted to SMBass as my favourite, with LMBass a close second.  Part of this is because the lighter tackle doesn't wear me out as fast and part is the number of fish per-hour...I'm a more-is-better kind of guy...HAHAHA."
190256,silveradosheriff,2008-04-21 12:34:00,1025,Nothing beats the rush of a big Musky....and I'll take Chinnies for numbers!  :-)
190260,OhioFisherman,2008-04-21 12:47:00,6623,"Voted L/M because them and Smallies weren`t combined. A Toss up for me, nice to catch some other species once in a while, but given a choice Bass is the winner."

190278,bullybass,2008-04-21 13:41:00,144,I voted largemouth bass... but really anything large or smallmouth bass is great... can't beat that over the lilypad heart-racing action... unless it is in the french river casting a mile with the wind and the spinner bait just touches the water and BAM!!!! there is a 5 pound smallie on.... nothing fights like a smallie!!!!... oh I need to go fishing!!!
190280,forrest,2008-04-21 13:45:00,1032,"My interpretation of the question is loving a fish from catching to eating.  Those Muskie don't taste so good.  I voted perch because they are fun for whole family to catch.  Other little fish I ""love"" to death:  -Pickerel -Pike -Bass   forrest"

190328,tbayboy,2008-04-21 15:49:00,1497,Tough one as I think style of fishing affects it as much as species but I picked Smallmouth.  Smallmouth wading in the Grand was probably the most fun I had last year but muskies are a very close second (smallies winning out due to the fact that I don't need a boat)
190336,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-04-21 16:08:00,1362,"Muskie is my 1st choice due to the fact that I hunt them almost every night during the season from my backyard!!....from now until the opening day in June though, I'm chasing Lakers, Speckies and Bows in small remote lakes"
