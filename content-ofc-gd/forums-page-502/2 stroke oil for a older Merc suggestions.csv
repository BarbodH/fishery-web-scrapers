610901,Freshtrax,2011-08-10 02:11:00,2215,Hey i log my oil and fuel consumption if it was a bad pump would have noticed one litre of oil every fifty litres of fuel.. Im not the only one who wont run synthetic in a two stroke.  Im not tryin to start a pissing match just sayin i dont think it burns well.  Dont know why. Dont care.. I just wont run it in a sled.
610919,baironhorse,2011-08-10 02:36:00,145,"Yes Irish I have been for the last hour or so...I thought that applied more to 4 strokes engine oil than it does to 2 strokes premix oil....Im still on the fence since I do have a 1991 25hp merc 2s that runs fine...been using shell nauttlus from Candain Tire...Not sure if this is a quality oil...  My plan this weekend is to run some seafoam as per instructions, changed plugs and run fresh tank of gas(add some stabile marine) with a quality two stroke oil.. "

610981,baironhorse,2011-08-10 12:34:00,145,Been running it all season..out at least once a week...will be on the lake for a week or so .... so I will have some time on my hands....it shouldn't take too long to do this or do you suggest clean her up before storing for winter??
610983,baironhorse,2011-08-10 12:36:00,145,So i guess for an older engine 1991 25hp sticking with shell Nautislis isnt to bad after a seafoamin? Not sure last time is was foamed maybe 5 seasons ago (guess) 
610985,scugpg,2011-08-10 12:39:00,1373," If the smoke currently isn't an issue for you, than stick to what works. The Amsoil will typically not smoke as much. Other than that you probably won't notice any other difference in that older motor."
611194,baironhorse,2011-08-11 02:37:00,145,She smokes when cold but after warm up all good...this is more of a maintenace thing...its my first boat so I want take care of her even if she is old!..thats why i ask you more experienced dudes! 
611247,Billy Bob,2011-08-11 11:18:00,5865,So 32 posts later and we still don't know what kind of oil to use......winter must be setting in around Ontario....
611378,Fisherman,2011-08-11 18:52:00,7201,"Ya, that's what I said earlier, the speed he's going to make up his mind he won't have to worry about oil, it will be molasses in a few more months, nows he's moaning about batteries and gas tank."
611501,baironhorse,2011-08-12 01:52:00,145,You think of it as moanin...I think of it increasing the learning curve from the ones that have been there before...i use what I have and make the best of it...thanks to all you have taken the time to respond to educate myself and others that read these posts...given the age of my engine I decided to finish what I have and use oem oil rather than synthetic...just not sold on synthetic yet.. 
610007,baironhorse,2011-08-07 21:43:00,145,I have been using shell nautilis 2 stroke oil for my 91 Merc 25hp.. Looking for something of better quality and maybe go synethic route...What do you guys suggest and where can I get it?
610013,scugpg,2011-08-07 22:00:00,1373,Amsoil saber 2 stroke outboard. Canadian tire should have it or look up local dealers on their site.  http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/ato.aspx
610024,Tootsie II,2011-08-07 22:49:00,162,"Even my old 1971- 20hp Johnson ran better, smoother and did not smoke as much using Amsoil 2 stroke. I will never go back to anything else for 2 strokes."
610063,baironhorse,2011-08-08 00:25:00,145,My boat is a 50:1 mix.... check out this chart from Amsoil site   
610066,baironhorse,2011-08-08 00:28:00,145,so this is the stuff you recommend...engine ratio is 50:1 that I mix myself...just want to confirm 
610071,Fisherman,2011-08-08 00:41:00,7201,"Gawd, yes, and don't over mix it."
610083,baironhorse,2011-08-08 00:54:00,145,I have bad habbit of adding an extra couple of oz of oil when mixing! So you guys suggest this is the best stuff out there? 
610088,scugpg,2011-08-08 01:00:00,1373,Mix it properly and it should smoke considerably less. If I had to premix that would be what I'd use.
610103,HTHM,2011-08-08 01:37:00,4082,"Follow the mixing ratio and it is much better for your engine. Would you overfill the crankcase in your car engine? Good luck with the engine, those older Mercs are great!"
610112,baironhorse,2011-08-08 02:04:00,145,The motor runs great really no issues...but I think its time for a little seafoam...new set of plugs and start using soem really good 2 cycle oil...I thought the shell 2 cycle was good until I did some research on the board...better late then never..any other advise or tips? 
610114,irishfield,2011-08-08 02:06:00,26272, Then why play with that??
610120,baironhorse,2011-08-08 02:18:00,145,I should edit my previous post...when she is cold she idles a little rough but when warmed up she is ok...I do troll alot and run a low speed so I figure it would be a good idea to give it a seafoamin to clean any excess build up and start clean with a quality 2cyc oli.. 
610304,porkpie,2011-08-08 18:13:00,2521,"As before... AMSOIL!  I have been running it for years, and its the only way to go!!!"
610388,hirk,2011-08-08 23:19:00,571,Hard to beat amsoil for the $. If your from the Oshawa area I sell both amsoil and seafoam.
610486,Freshtrax,2011-08-09 02:52:00,2215,I dont know about boats but i will never run amsoil interceptor in a sled again i ran it for a few weeks.. And when i pulled my exaust scuffed pistons.  Split the case.. And it was next to dry in there. Like i said no experiance with boat motors
610489,irishfield,2011-08-09 03:00:00,26272,I won't run full synthetic in ANYTHING Freshtrax... but that's a road we've been down around here countless times in 7 years!
610546,Sinker,2011-08-09 04:45:00,8692,"I run the oil recommended by the manufacturer in my mariner. I have been for the last 15 yrs. Why do you think you should change oil?? Its much more important to mix it properly, than it is to use more expensive, synthetic oils.  I don't know why people have such a hard time with mixed gas/oil. A 50:1 mix is the same as 1L/20ml. In other words, for each liter of gas, add 20ml of oil. Pretty straight forward math. Why add more oil? I never understood that.  Also, if my motor was oil injected, instead of pre-mix, I would use ALOT less oil in a season. Most times the manufacturers recommended mix is over kill to start with. Adding more is just making more smoke, and polluting the water more......and don't forget how much you paid for that oil!!  S."
610549,Freshtrax,2011-08-09 05:22:00,2215,Hey i agree with you on two strokes but mobil 1 in my trucks i swear by my 98 Z71 had 400K when i sold it and ran like a champ nothing but mobil and skids of shingles in the bed for years.. I just dont think the synthetic stuff burns well in twosteokes i like a mineral oil... Shell advance in the polaris and in the boats!
610560,Fisherman,2011-08-09 11:15:00,7201, Don't blame the oil for a bad injector/oil pump.
610562,Billy Bob,2011-08-09 11:21:00,5865,"For what it is worth I have been running Walmart SuperTech 2 stroke oil in my 1985 Johnson VRO 50hp for at least 10 maybe closer to 15 years and it purrs like a new born outboard....just ask Big Cliff.....he heard/seen my rig when we were up at his place for a week in June.  I was paying $8.95 per gallon but purchased 5 gallons years ago....however, I believe it's $10.95 per gallon now."
610701,bubbles,2011-08-09 16:28:00,591,"On this topic, I use Quicksilver in my 78 Merc and was just at CTC for some more, every kind was on sale except for......... you guessed it, the one I needed.  Is it true that this only happens to me?"
610731,Tootsie II,2011-08-09 17:40:00,162,"I've used the Amsoil ""Interceptor"" and pardon me for seeming old-fashioned, but I mix my own oil and gas. I have never liked the idea on being 75 km back in the North- Ontario bush and relying on some injection system to insert the correct amount of oil into my motors.  I've heard too many horror stories about burnt out engines in the early years of those systems and still don't trust them. I know it's probably hard to find larger 2 stroke engines that don't have these systems on them but I've heard of mechanics telling people to remove their injection system and mix the gas ""the old-fashioned"" way."
610869,baironhorse,2011-08-10 01:21:00,145,so half of you guys are on the the syntetic side and others on regular oil! ....Isn't synthtic a more pure clean product than regular oil...shouldn't it provide better lubrication?
610870,baironhorse,2011-08-10 01:24:00,145, Why is that Irish?
610893,irishfield,2011-08-10 01:58:00,26272,"Here's one reason... synthetics do a VERY lousy job of holding contaminants in suspension.
