611266,jat,2011-08-11 12:57:00,138,I was wondering if anyone knew where to get a new or used (in good condition) exhaust manifold for my Civic - the cat converter is attached. I have no idea which is a good make to get. I've heard that Dorman isn't the greatest and the one from Honda is too much money. Any ideas. Thanks

611285,danbouck,2011-08-11 13:55:00,4380,check out a local scrap yard
611299,DanD,2011-08-11 14:49:00,2223,"Aftermarket Manifold with Integral Catalytic Converter  The pricing doesn't look bad; no idea on the quality of the converter?  Why is it you need/want a manifold; cracked, broken or bad Cat? These front cats on Hondas rarely go bad; unless the engine has been running poorly for a long time. Converters don't die of natural causes; they are murdered. LOL  Dan."

611336,Bernie,2011-08-11 16:24:00,3190,I also have had very good success with Dorman product.
611357,DanD,2011-08-11 17:44:00,2223,"I also have to agree with the guys that Dorman goes sell decent products. But when I went to their web site, I didn’t see a listing for an integral converter manifold assembly for the D16Y8 engine code that all Civic EX came with?  Dan."

I've used them twice I needed a power mirror – Dealer $420 his price $64. A headlight $35. Struts for my daughter's car $135 each side +80 to install! Mechanic wanted $700.
