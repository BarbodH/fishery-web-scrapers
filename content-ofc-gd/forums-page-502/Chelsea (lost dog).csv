There has been spottings/sightings of the dog all over Brooklin.  The most common areas that are sending the calls in are from the Carwith Rd area at the East end where the road ends and to the North of there towards Columbus Rd.  I'll be going for a walk in the woods today in the area to see if I see her.  if you spot the dog don't try and catch her, call the number and keep an eye on her, cheers.  http://www.durhamregion.com/article/177598  Geoff"
