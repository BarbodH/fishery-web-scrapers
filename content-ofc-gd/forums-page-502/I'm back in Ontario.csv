610465,GBW,2011-08-09 02:21:00,8460,"Hey all.  Last week my family (10 of us) got together for a 7 Day Southern Caribbean cruise from San Juan, Puerto Rico to St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Lucia, St Kitts & St. Maarten.  My brother-in-law and I decided we would set out for 4 hours deep sea fishing in St. Thomas.  The Captains name was Geoff too so we figured it was going to be a good day.    We got all set up and 6 lines in the water for the 5 passengers.  We drew straws to see who would get the first 15 min in the chair and then rotate through the group.   My luck would have it I was second!  My bro-in-law got 1st crack at it.    Well just as his time was about to be up, FISH ON!  Then all of a sudden 2 other lines go off!  Too bad for me I was the farthest from those rod’s to get my hands on one.      So I help clear the other lines that were in the way.    The rest of the day was some HUGE swells and waves and not another hit was had by any of us.  So I took over being the Captain to see if I could change our luck, no dice…    It was time to head in so we took a few pic’s of the caught fish and headed back to the shore.     We decided a ‘team 8’ lunch & beer was in order too.  It was so fresh...     One last pic of my bro-in-laws fish as we couldn't bring them back on the ship.    Um, how did that get in there?!?!?!  Either way it was a fun 4 hours and I’ll do it all again.  Cheers."

610472,irishfield,2011-08-09 02:29:00,26272,WHAT    No Bikinis... no Corona at the Sunset Bar and Grill in Saint Marteen?    ..wouldn't have minded seeing a stone oven pizza from St. Lucia either..
610473,Rod Caster,2011-08-09 02:30:00,5784,Bonus points for team 8! Nice trip Geoff.
610480,GBW,2011-08-09 02:43:00,8460,"nope, the only camera I bring out is the fishing one.  My bro-in-law may have some others I can add to this post too."
610485,mercman,2011-08-09 02:51:00,7054, You kidding Wayne ?? The wife went through the pics first and ixnayed them  Nice trip Geoff
610510,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-09 03:35:00,4399,"Welcome back Geoff just wasn`t the same around here with out you!  Wifey and I did that same cruise last year had a blast, spent way too much money shopping!"
610533,Live2fish85,2011-08-09 04:09:00,1633,Hey great report Geoff. Looks like a nice day fishing and sounds like a great cruise.
610541,young_one,2011-08-09 04:27:00,620,Thanks for the report Geoff! Huge round eyes on those fish!
610569,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-09 11:57:00,2690,Cool Geoff!!  Is that a small tuna??  At least you got out fishing for a few hours. What are the temps like down there this time of year???
610577,Court R,2011-08-09 12:45:00,213,
610581,GBW,2011-08-09 12:56:00,8460,"Thanks all     Yup, yellow fin tuna and the temps right now are mid to high 30's.  Just like being here with SOME better things to try and look at."
610679,craigdritchie,2011-08-09 15:36:00,1586,"Tunas are a riot. There are tons of them around Cuba as well (most of the beach hotels can fix you up with a charter).  Love the ""tips are appreciated"" sign on the seat back. Real subtle!"
610729,GBW,2011-08-09 17:31:00,8460,"yeah, that's why I made sure I got the pic.  Neither of them asked for a penny more though when the day was done."
610762,glen,2011-08-09 19:45:00,2641,Thanks for the report.  If you dont mind what does that charter cost?
610764,Joey,2011-08-09 19:58:00,9122,Looks like fun Geoff.   Great pics and fish
610777,ketchenany,2011-08-09 20:31:00,3229,Better looking fish at Orient Beach  But hard to catch!
610787,GBW,2011-08-09 21:38:00,8460,thanks and I think it was $140.00 US per person for 4 hours of fishing time.
610833,Leecher,2011-08-10 00:08:00,7832,Awesome trip Geoff Guess you got lots of tuna to eat now.... I see cans galore in your future Thanks form sharing Jacques
611195,ccmtcanada,2011-08-11 02:37:00,7971,Looked like a blast Geoff!  Some great looking fish...would love to fish there some day!

611552,pikehunter,2011-08-12 11:43:00,1659,"A trip for sure with memories for life. Great pictures!  Love the ""Tip"" sign, It's about the same size as the boat! Good thing too, if the mother ship was going down you could always use it for a life boat!"
611786,2jack2,2011-08-13 03:01:00,92,cool pics and report.
