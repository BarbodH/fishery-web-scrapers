611715,Steve_R,2011-08-12 22:13:00,81,Hi...Just wondering how the fishing is on Red Ceder Lake and area? I will be heading up there in a week. Thanks. Steve
611794,Rod Caster,2011-08-13 05:23:00,5784,I fished a nearby lake today.. A storm caught us off guard and we only caught one walleye. I've never fished Red Cedar but the lakes in that area have lots of structure and are  fun to fish. Good luck!
611854,kuhaman,2011-08-13 14:55:00,503,Red cedar is a pretty good fishery. I've fished it quite a few times. The walleye can be tricky to catch sometimes but it seems the smallies are always willing to bite. There are other lakes in the area that are pretty good too.
