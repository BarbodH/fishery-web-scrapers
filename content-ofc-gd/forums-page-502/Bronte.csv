612062,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-14 17:23:00,0,here's a tip i got from a local pro in downtown sault ste. marie...  when salmon fishing gets real tough he likes to equip with low viz fluoro and a 5/O treble with a bell sinker on one of the hooks and a roe bag on there.  i find even the most reluctant fish can't resist.
