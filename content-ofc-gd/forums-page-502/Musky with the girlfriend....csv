611505,mike rousseau,2011-08-12 02:15:00,4661,Well I took out my good luck charm tonight... Marissa...  The usuals weren't producing... So I reached into my bag of tricks... And we picked up 3 musky in about 1-1.5 hours...  Marissa was pumped with her 42 incher that put on some Arian displays... Thrashed a couple times and a real nice summersault...      The second fish was marissa's... She doesn't hold em... Just likes to reel em in...  And the third didn't want it's photo taken so it decided to inhale the bait... Took to long unhooking it so we put it back without a pic... Better safe then sorry...
611506,mercman,2011-08-12 02:21:00,7054,Dude Simple awesome Mike.Looking forward to getting out with you on Saturday for walley. I've been stoked for a week now

611533,Handlebarz,2011-08-12 10:03:00,3790,Nice going Mike and to make it better you had to change up the program to get to the fish it shows that some times you need to work for them.
611540,Billy Bob,2011-08-12 10:44:00,5865,"Dude, Nice looking fish but your girlfriend needs to shave...."
611555,mike rousseau,2011-08-12 12:03:00,4661, That's the St.Lawrence river pattern... They are mostly beautiful fish...    Yeah... Went to the black perch... Now I have some confidence in that color...     I keep telling her that... Oh well... It makes static sparks when we kiss now... Lol
611564,Live2fish85,2011-08-12 12:30:00,1633,Nice Job. You really know how to get your musky shows you know what your doing.  I wish my girlfriend enjoyed fishing. She doesn't even care to be in a boat.
611566,mike rousseau,2011-08-12 12:32:00,4661,I'm a really really lucky guy... She asked me if I could take her out for musky... She said she's been jonesing to get another one...
