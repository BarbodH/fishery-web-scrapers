If what I remember this community is the place to ask where to go, techniques, sun moon phases and everything between. This was a great community, I'm positive it still is. Planning a trip around Burleigh/Peterborough/Kawarthas area this Wednesday. Shore fishing, hope to get into lg bass, maybe some sm bass, pike, perch, carp if above isn't going. Can someone recommend me where I'd have best chance to get into something. Not looking for exact spots, basically an update on where is hot. Been a whole year since I been out. Excited for this chance. Thanks, Good fishing.  Aleks"
