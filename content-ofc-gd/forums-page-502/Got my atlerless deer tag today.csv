Question for the other hunters.  Does entering a second choice for WMU reduce your chance of you getting your first choice?  I wanted 76, but didn't get it.  If I wouldn't have entered 85 as a second choice, would I still not have gotten 76 this year?  Also just applied for the Controlled Deer hunt over the phone.  Just a reminder, you have till Aug 31st."
611363,10point,2011-08-11 18:14:00,165, I have about 14 or so doe tags here in Indiana on my lifetime license. It's crazy how many you can take here. Some places have really seen a decline. Most deer I have taken in 1 season is 5.

611371,NAW,2011-08-11 18:23:00,4022, Never thought about putting the same WMU for second choice too.  Clever.

Being I hunt with my Ex's family, I consider it a security blanket for being able to join the club.....I have entered the same WMU in the second choice box.  Phone last year, office this year."
