We catch some bass but nothing big enough to write home about. We go to another spot and I tell my son this hole is the only place on the  Grand I've ever caught a walleye in the KW area. we work the hole with tubes and grubs and bam my son has fish on. Lands a beauty 23"" eye out of the exact same spot I got one 10 or so years ago. Made our day. Just funny how one particular spot can produce a less caught species while everything around it is a bass factory."
