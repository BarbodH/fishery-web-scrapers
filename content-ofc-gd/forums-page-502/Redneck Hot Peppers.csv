611138,mercman,2011-08-10 22:08:00,7054," Hard to diferentiate between the 2.Mainland has a subtle tang of lime, where as the Azores is more robust and woody. Personally i appreciate the lime tingle from the Mainland, but thats just me"

Heck you can make that one of your secret ingredients in the Captian Bob's shrimp dish.  BTW served them to CPH and his lovely lady the other night (full credits to you) and they loved them too! It is one of Sue and mine favorites! Thanks again!
