Just a little one, about 3 inches, snagged it on the underbelly actually.  Only one I have seen first hand so far on the river - maybe they have been there for awhile, but I fish the river weekly and I heard they were in Rice, but just hadn't come across them in the river yet.  I crushed it's head with some pliers - hopefully a nice smallmouth had it as a meal."

We were fishing around Bensfort Bridge, first week of July, and kind of coaching some new Canadians. One snagged a goby and had no idea what it was. Luckily we had the fishing regs with us, showed them a picture, and it was returned dead back to nature."
