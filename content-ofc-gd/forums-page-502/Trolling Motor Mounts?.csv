608642,rhymobot,2011-08-02 16:25:00,174,Hi.  I have a trolling motor and I want to put it on my Sevylor inflatable boat. Now I need the mount. Why are they so hard to find and where can I get one? How much should I be spending on it?  Thanks.
608645,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-02 16:30:00,10439,You tried LeBarons?  Sevylor Boats and Acc.
608646,John Bacon,2011-08-02 16:32:00,3277,Canadian Tire may have them for around $50.  You can also try LeBaron's.  If not you should be able to order on-line.
608647,rhymobot,2011-08-02 16:33:00,174,  Thanks for reminding me. I believe I saw that mount at le barons years ago. But for that price it makes you wonder why it costs so much for a piece of wood and two pipes.
608648,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-02 16:38:00,10439,"  Simple, it goes on a boat!!!! If it went on a lawn mower it would be 1/2 the price!!!!! You do realize that B.O.A.T stands for Break Out Another Thousand  right?"
608649,rhymobot,2011-08-02 16:38:00,174, Very true.
608692,Dabluz,2011-08-02 20:13:00,701,"From the looks of the one shown in the Le Baron's catalogue, it would be real simple to just make one."
608694,irishfield,2011-08-02 20:17:00,26272,"I have a torch and air drill.... oh wait, inflatable boat !"
608732,RyanT,2011-08-02 22:11:00,72,"Just make your own.  Get some pvc pipe, wood, brackets etc. and make your own."
608786,rhymobot,2011-08-03 00:34:00,174,I'm not handy at all. I would have to charge myself a thousand bucks labour because that's how much time it would take me to finally figure it out.
610644,rhymobot,2011-08-09 14:42:00,174,Got the one from le barons and used it last night. There are 2 pipes on each side. One pipe slides in to the other and is tightened with tightening collars and screws.  BOTH tightening collars broke as I was tightening them. They're made out of cheap plastic while everything else is metal or wood.  Sevylor better send me replacements after I just emailed them. Cost me 93 bucks for that thing.
611597,rhymobot,2011-08-12 13:51:00,174,"Thought you guys might find this interesting.  Coleman is undoubtedly the #1 name in outdoor products.  I called Coleman USA after my email went unreplied to and they said they don't have replacement parts for those tightening collars which probably cost 50 cents. They told me they'll ship me a whole new motor mount but first they wanted me to destroy mine with a hammer, take a pic and send it to them. Then they found out I'm in Canada so told me to call Coleman Canada. I did and they also don't have the collars. They said they would exchange the whole mount for a new one at the warehouse on Matheson. Of course when I get the new one, the same thing is going to happen as the damn parts are made out of plastic!  Why wouldn't Coleman just ask the plastic moulding company that made the parts for some new ones? Sometimes I don't understand how businesses work."
611629,NAW,2011-08-12 15:18:00,4022," Because if Lebarron sells it for $93, Coleman likely builds it for $5 - $10.  It aint even worth the guys labour to call the plastics place to enquire about the parts."
611637,rhymobot,2011-08-12 15:39:00,174,True enough. Yet they want me to clobber the thing to prove its not functional anymore and then ship another one after I send them a pic. That aint worth the time either!
611640,rhymobot,2011-08-12 15:48:00,174,I can still use the mount with duct tape while waiting for the parts to come in  By destroying the mount then waiting for another I wouldnt be able to use my motor that whole time  Sometimes the simplest thing is too complicated
