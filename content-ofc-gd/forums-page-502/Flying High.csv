611522,workwear,2011-08-12 03:31:00,592,glad to see your living the dream!!!!............hard work and perseverance!!!...truly awwwwsome!!!!
611527,Jet,2011-08-12 07:34:00,364,"The words of support really mean a lot everyone. Thanks for taking the time to share them with me.  It's been a very long road to get here. I first visited Kimberley four years ago and it only took a few days for me to realize I wanted to live here. Ever since that fateful trip, I started thinking about ways to get myself out here. Careers are quite limited in the Kootenays, so you really have to create your own opportunities. Kinbari was the idea that became that opportunity.  If anyone here every finds themselves in the East Kootenays drop me a line. There's a river waiting and a dinner table empty and they both have something to do with fish!  Cheers!"
611529,solopaddler,2011-08-12 09:30:00,8605,What you've accomplished out there and the life you're living is truly inspiring.  Some beautiful fish as well. You're definitely living in the right place to learn fly fishing.  Good luck in the future!
611541,Spiel,2011-08-12 10:46:00,9065,"Fabulous report Jet, from the first picture to the last, outstanding!"
611543,ccmtcanada,2011-08-12 11:07:00,7971,Damn! I was about as close to there as I have been in decades...just got back from visiting Banff!  Absolutely amazing report Jet!  As I drove through the mountains I noticed every river and ever lake and itched to wet a line.  To fish in those surroundings is a dream...and the fish you caught were incredible!  Very inspiring report!  The restaurant looks great too!  I want to visit one day for sure!
611635,johnnyb,2011-08-12 15:38:00,3413,"How did you even have time to put that report together?  Amazing stuff...and congrats on the restaurant!  From now on, we'll be happy with just the pics so you can squeeze out a few more minutes of free time between those incredible hikes and that insane sushi  "
611721,Victor,2011-08-12 22:55:00,1609,Congrats on the grand opening of the restaurant! It looks spectacular. All the time and effort have certainly paid off.  Everytime I read your reports I just have to say this - I'm so jealous of the sexy pools and runs you have over there.  Just added to my to-do list - learn how to fly fish and fly over to BC with my pin and flyrod.
611731,Whitespinnerbait,2011-08-12 23:50:00,2038,"OK..  Report of the Year, Century , Lifetime !! Congrats ,three times over"
611740,MJL,2011-08-13 00:16:00,2427,"Bull trout sashimi?  I am craving seaweed salad, spicy salmon and BBQ unagi soooo bad  Once I acquire a few more pieces of tackle, I will be on my way...And yes, I do have a new set of waders and boots ready"
611224,Jet,2011-08-11 07:48:00,364,"Ever since I've moved to the east Kootenay's it's been nothing but work, work, work! I relocated to Kimberley, BC back in October 2010 to open up a restaurant (www.kinbari.ca). I took a building from the 1930's and fully renovated it, then added a new two-story addition to house the kitchen and expand the living area upstairs. It took nearly six months of non-stop construction (renos are always full of surprises, and often not good ones), with myself in the trenches every day to try and get it all done. When our goal of being open for ski-season was clearly not going to be achieved, we all just put our heads down, stopped setting an opening date and just got 'er done.    In the trenches literally     And the results of blood, sweat and the occasional tear!    Before     After     Before     After      Kinbari officially opened on April 23, 2011. I thought I knew busy during the construction and planning stage. Now busy is an understatement!   While I'm now surrounded by some of the most pristine fishing waters available to man, I actually fish less than I did living in Toronto - 15 hour work days will do that to ya. However, every free chance I'd exploit to the fullest with a fully packed SUV, Google Maps and a lot of driving, walking and bush whacking. As some of you may know from my last few reports it started all with Bull Trout.  Armed with a centerpin, I tried desperately to fill the void created by the absence of Steelhead. Little did I know there was something likely far greater on the horizon.  Though I came here with a small arsenal of fly fishing gear, I never really got into it fishing in Ontario. And despite living here, I quietly convinced myself that I'd stick more to the pin. Tapered leaders. Double haul casting. Sinking tips. It all sounded overwhelming and it didn't help that the pin was producing a lot of Bull Trout and big ones like this:         Then came spring and for the first time since I moved here out came the fly rod (as back up to my pin of course). Though free time was even more at a premium with the restaurant open, every spare moment was spent on a river somewhere. Luckily out here I can be on a prime river in 20 minutes or less.  The first few handful of trips as the river levels dropped started peaking my curiosity.         But every time I saw a deep pool, I couldn't help busting out the pin. And again it produced.     Lovely colours too!      Still something inside pushed me to keep on fly fishing, to give it more of a chance. So I started exploring more and more.   Potential in the distance.    It was a long, steep walk down. Even longer going up!    But it was worth it.          And as I dedicated more time to the fly, the more fish I found on the end of my line.                  Another free day found me venturing further away from home. To get to this river, you had to drive over 40km down narrow logging roads like this going deep into the Kootenay valleys.     I had to bush whack a ton to find places to fish. On a map the river looked easy to explore. More often than not they were always teasing me from the top of a steep cliff.     It was here that I can say that I was converted to fly fishing. The other fish I caught were fun, but not anything I didn't expect. In this remote river the scenery was near perfect, the isolation surreal and rises spectacular. When a massive Westslope Cutthroat leaped out of the water like a humpback whale to smash my dry fly, I finally realized what all the fuss was about. It was truly one of the greatest things I have witnessed in my fishing career.  Unfortunately I was alone and this epic Cutty slipped away before I could get a picture. But many more would follow that day like these.                           Ever since I've been building up my fly fishing closet. A new Sage reel, St. Croix Rod and Rio Sinking tip line have been added to the line-up and the next target is my first Bull Trout on the fly - and I already have the perfect place in mind (yes for its beauty but mostly because here I don't have to cast as far! Learning to cast heavy streamers can be very frustrating!)      But for now it's back to work. I can't wait for the next free day.  Sushi anyone??? (This is our best-selling roll called the Dynamiters, not to be confused with the Dynamite Roll)     Thanks for reading!"
