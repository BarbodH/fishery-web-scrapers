I don't think they live by the '20mins and be brew a new pot'  It tastes like ass every single time."

The Legend goes....Once long ago, in the Land of the Midnight Sun, long before the Walmart, the Canadian Tire, the McDonalds, the Boston Pizza, the smoke free hotel on Airport Road...hmmm they could make one of their sentimental TV ads about it...  Actually was rescued before it closed. What is now popularly known as 'an intervention'.  There was also another flap about their huge inflatable coffee cup not conforming to local sign bylaw regulations. It was time to move elsewhere....Yellowknife was following the customs of places in the south....you were even required to license your cats...."

I transfer my beans into a coffee can when I open the bag to keep them fresher.  That would be grate if you guys carried the machines. It would be nice to save something off the nearly $1,200 pricetag on the combo.  Just need to auction off my first born to pay for it!!!!!"

It is my understanding that pattent extensions have been applied for. Will they be granted? We'll see! You seem to know a lot about Keurig and GMC, are you involved in the industry?"

611184,adolson,2011-08-11 01:44:00,783," I'm not in the industry, no (though I did look at the stock prices for GMC - wish I knew about trading because I saw the Starbucks announcement a mile away, and the stock went up pretty quick after that). I'm a programmer for an ISP. Are you? You seem to know a lot about coffee, too. I love coffee, and I love my Keurig, and so I know some stuff... I've tried a ton of the K-cups, including the Folgers and Barista Prima K-cups and other stuff you don't find in retail stores around here. I just know I hated the Tassimo (slow, messy, plus it broke down after about 4 months - they replaced it), though I miss the cappuccino/latte capability. It wasn't perfect, but it was pretty good. Terrible selection, though (last I checked, there are more tea varieties for Keurig than all of Tassimo's selection combined). I am not very familiar with Dolce Gusto or any other pod-based competition, and my only hands-on experience is Tassimo and Keurig.  I hadn't heard about the patent extensions, and I hope they aren't granted.. Paying more does suck, in any industry and any commodity, but given the crop issues, it's not really a shocker that prices are trending upwards. I'm the only one in the house who drinks it, and it's still cheaper than hitting Tim Hortons every day. Especially since the nearest one to me is like a 15-20 minute drive away. And at least with Keurig there are several options to use your own grounds - something the Tassimo design makes nearly impossible.  When I say I love coffee, I'm not joking. Here's a slightly out-of-date pic of my coffee cupboard:  And there's more than that - I have a huge box of mixed ones on top of the fridge, including teas, decafs, and various flavored and unflavored coffees.Those green-topped bottles are another beverage system... Anyone know what they are?"
611185,ccmtcanada,2011-08-11 01:50:00,7971,I remember checking a while ago when the tax thing was first brought up.  I checked a few times right after that and the tax was correct.  Wonder if they accidentally hit a larger size by accident?
611205,registerfly,2011-08-11 03:00:00,198,  I too switched over recently and am a total convert. My wife unfortunately still goes to Timmies. I love the Med coffee with $.20 muffin. Can't resist the muffin.    
611213,BillM,2011-08-11 03:25:00,17367, Worst coffee in the entire province.  Although I'm not surprised.   Almost all the Timmys in Barrie are extremely consistent.  Although I make my coffee at home and bring a travel mug in the car.
611222,GYPSY400,2011-08-11 05:02:00,191,"Travel mug and thermos for me!! I can make a whole pot of drip coffee faster than waiting in line at my local Tims ( possibly the slowest in the country) I do find that Mc D's coffee is better than Tims coffe though, and slightly cheaper."
611236,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 10:29:00,6899," As I mentioned in my original reply to this thread; yes, I am in the industry, I am a Key Account Manager for the largest Canadian owned coffee distributor LOL.  I have and do use Keurig, Tassimo, Flavia and many, many other systems, we sell/supply them all primarly to businesses and food service accounts but there is a growing demand within the retail market as well."
611240,fishinmortician,2011-08-11 11:01:00,100,"I was in Nova Scotia for 4 months for work and at Tim Hortons there, your expected to tip.  They leave pennies and other change all over the counters to show how much they're hauling in.  I wouldn't leave a cent because it's the same old lousy service you get here in Ontario.  People would buy a 1.39 coffee and leave a buck! Unreal!  I might tip if they got rid of those god awful flat ass pants and funny lookin hairnets though."
611279,adolson,2011-08-11 13:48:00,783," I guess I missed that part. Not sure how, since it was literally the very first thing you wrote.  If you sell to consumers via an online store, shoot me a link, I'd love to check it out. Right now I order my coffee from about three different sites, depending on what I want. I can always add another."
611292,rufus,2011-08-11 14:29:00,267," I agree.  <rant>I drink my coffee black as a rule and when I am forced to have Tim's coffee, the only way it is tolerable is with cream. It shouldn't really be called coffee...  And another thing - how in the heck did they ever get to where they are with such bad doughnuts and bagels?? Mind you, my family had a bakery when I was a kid so I developed a taste for good doughnuts.  Marketing must the secret to Tim's success so they could probably charge whatever they want and people would keep going. It sure isn't the food and coffee that attracts people. </rant>  I do love their Iced Caps though and would pay more for them if I had to"
611314,Lunker777,2011-08-11 15:24:00,866,I thought about that.... but it doesnt work.... A medium is $2.49... I only paid $1.98
611333,blarg,2011-08-11 16:22:00,289," When did the Tims in Yellowknife go bankrupt?  My wife worked there for a time and I never heard of this, though the service wasn't very good, like most places in Yellowknife tbh, they were one of the busiest franchises in the country."
611341,Billy Bob,2011-08-11 16:36:00,5865, Timmy's coffee - Good Dognuts - Bad Bagels - Pretty good to Good Sandwiches - Good but way over priced
611345,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-11 16:58:00,10439, They still are stupidly busy. If the owner had 1/2 a brain he would open another downtown and it would be just as busy. Personally I don't go in there because I don't drink regular coffee and am staying away from all those carb filled treats in there. Might have to pick up a pack of timbits for the road when I leave for Alaska in 3 weeks though.  There are always long lines at the counter and drive through but they are no slower than most of the Timmies in Ontario that I have been too. They may have stepped up their service a notch or two since you were here though.  Now the McDonalds in town may as well be a sit down restaurant as they have got to be the slowest on the planet. (I don't go there much either)

611350,fishnsled,2011-08-11 17:17:00,3520," Heard about those profits this morning Bernie. Not to say I don't go to Tim's, but it is becoming more and more less frequent. Maybe I should try the McD's coffee - too bad there isn't one on my way to work. Home brew will do for now."
611361,danbouck,2011-08-11 18:07:00,4380,Just occurred to me... isn't a small ice cap 1.89???
611393,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 19:30:00,6899," Sorry, we don't sell retail at all, we strictly supply businesses; areans, hospitals, office coffee systems, restaurants..... almost any business that has any volume. Heck, if your volumes are high enough we even supply the brewers for free. For the Starbucks users, we can even supply that for their businesses as long as it isn't for resale.  However if you are ever in the Lindsay area I'd be happy to take you into our warehouse and you can pick up whatever you want wholesale. Mind you, we don't stock all the 250+ flavours available LOL."
611401,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 19:50:00,6899," The coffee is the same at all the Tim Hortons, the reason that it tastes different is because of the water. Water quality has a huge impact on the flavour of the coffee, chloriene, hard, soft, iron, sulpher, mineral content.... they all affect the flavour.  You might be surprised at what it takes to brew a good cup of coffee! The quality of the coffee is without a doubt the most important, you'd be amazed at all the different grades of coffee there are but that aside:  Water is perhaps the most important but that can sometimes be compensated for by choosing the right coffee to match the water.  Temperature is critical, water should be 195-205°C for a standard drip brewer, too cold, it doesn't extract the full flavours of the coffee, too hot, it strips unwanted oils. Grind and time are important.  Leave it sit on a burner for more than 15 minutes, it starts to scald. Leave it sit in a thermous for 4 hours, the oils start to seperate.  You'd be surprised at some of the food services places that I go into and the first thing they ask is ""how much""? They don't care about quality, they just want the cheepest thing they can get. They don't usually stay in business too long. The places that are successful take pride in serving good quality everything at a fair price!"
611403,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-11 19:57:00,2690, Great info Cliff!  This has turned into an interesting thread...at least for anyone who enjoys their cup of Joe
611404,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 19:57:00,6899," Coffee: If you put enough cream and sugar in it LOL  Donuts: They use to make them right in the store, now they ship them frozen to the store and they finish them there. Next time you are here, I am going to take you for an apple fritter that will blow your mind!  Bagles: I prefer Beagles  Wouldn't buy a sandwich at Tim's so I can't comment. Sue makes the best!"
611407,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 20:07:00,6899, Isn't it amazing at how technical something that seems so simple can be LOL. I'll bet there are many others on this board that could enlighten us on their particular trades!
611426,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-11 20:35:00,10439,Cliff Not only the quality of the beans but the quality of the roast are important. I have seen too many places serve expresso made with inferior quality beans (bad roasting job) that I am very picky about my beans. I have been buying imported beans (from Italy) recently as our only local bean roaster has changed and the beans are no longer up to my standards. Can't remember the name of the beans I've been getting but I don't have a clue what the packaging says as it's all in Italian. They are packaged in a good thick foil package and make a pretty decent cup of expresso. I am looking forward to the day when I can upgrade my grinder and machine. I want a Rancilio Silva expresso machine and Rancilio Rocky grinder.  I'll gladly take one at wholesale if you gots.
611040,Lunker777,2011-08-10 15:58:00,866,"Hey everyone  This post is in part with the post a few months back about Tim Hortons over charging for things.

I was charged $1.98.... ?????? I was late for work and in a rush so I just gave the toonie and left before it hit me !!!!  Im gunna continue to do this and see how many different prices I get! asking for a receipt everytime... to keep track !  Any one else start paying attention to there Timmys prices since that post earlier in the year ?"

611092,johnnyb,2011-08-10 19:52:00,3413,"Yep....Timmie's has a small....basically a cardboard shotglass.  For the same price as their medium, I get a ""small"" at McDonald's which is the same size, along with a muffin.  The McD's coffee doesn't taste quite as good, but the muffin sure makes up the difference"
611093,Fisherman,2011-08-10 19:53:00,7201,"That's the biggest part of the merican problem, they like to super size everything, hamburgers, pop, debt, fat hanging over the belt line, and yes we do have a small coffee.  But just like the beer, ours tastes better by far.  I've had Timmies across the border, it tastes like they ran the water through twice."
611096,Billy Bob,2011-08-10 19:56:00,5865, I heard they just do that to vehicles with Canadian plates....

611127,Governator,2011-08-10 21:36:00,879,"They probably accidentally hit medium instead of small on the cashier, it happens.  I'm not defending anyone just saying drive-thrus make mistakes and I'm sure they don't have weekly team pep talks to tell their grunt workers to ""accidentally"" hit medium on people routinely to make more money."
611129,Big Cliff,2011-08-10 21:43:00,6899,"Well, being in the coffee business has been a real eye opener for me! Tim Horton's secret; they use 18% cream in their coffee most people (not all) who like their coffee black don't like Tim Hortons. MD's did a really good job of coming up with a blend, not bad coffee if you like blends.  What would really kill you is if you knew the margins these guys make on the coffee. You think gas is expensive? Try a cost of WELL less than $0.30/ cup all in! (cup, cream, sugar, lid, stir stick, coffee).  Keurig; excellent product, good variety, about 1/2 the cost of a Timmies. Problem! A company called Green Mountian has bought out all the K cup manufactures. (they had an angle in that they licensed all the manufacturers, then threatened to pull the license if they didn't sell out to them)  They now own a monoploy and again, you are paying through the nose for what you get (our cost has gone up by 30% since last Oct. and we sell millions of them every year.  It ain't going to get better! All these specials you see on the brewer are the same marketing ploy as printer companies use. They will almost give you the brewer because the product you use in it is where they make their profit and they control the product.  What are your options? Well, there are several but I won't even try to go into that here, someone will accuse me of spam. All I can say is do some research. If you have a question I'll be happy to try to answer it for you, Pm me."
611130,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-10 21:44:00,10439,"  Seems every takeout joint in the states has bigger drinks (hence the growing population    ). Take BK for instance a small drink there is the size of a medium in Canada, a medium in the US is a Canadian large and a Yankee large drink is a 45 gallon drum with a length of 5/8"" garden hose for a straw and doesn't exist in Canada."
611133,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-10 21:51:00,10439,  This is my solution to the expensive cost of good coffee. Sure the equipment was a little spendy and it took a while to get the grinding/brewing process down but now I make as good an espresso or moccha as any coffee house and it doesn't cost $5 a cup!!!    
611134,Handlebarz,2011-08-10 21:54:00,3790,I switched to MC D's a couple years ago when they started the FREE coffee to show off there new blend its great. I hate the free coffee weeks now as they are so busy I dont get my coffee to many people there just for the free bee but then again it works as I am hooked.  The price for a large coffee and muffin is $1.87 how can ya beat that the change always goes to Ronald McD house.

I was told that he was doing this because 'Tim Horton's' coffee was just soooooooo good. I did not even know what tim hortons was....lol.  What makes me laugh is that i've put folgers in the machine at work and told all the timmies freaks that its timmies...they loved it!  I know thats kind of mean but i never told them and what you dont know wont hurt you too bad.  I also think McDs is  better coffee than Tims, hope they dont trick me back....lol...but to be honest i would not really care."
611141,adolson,2011-08-10 22:18:00,783,"Well, I used to have a Tassimo, and the thing was a bloody mess. I miss the Starbucks breakfast blend, but not for long. Starbucks is jumping ship to Keurig, so GMC must be doing something right. But you didn't explain why it's an issue that they own a monopoly on a product they also own, as Keurig is owned by GMC? It's not like they own Kraft and Nestle and every other coffee option in the world. In any case, the patents on the K-cup expire in 2012, so their evil K-cup monopoly won't go on for much longer.  True that... In North Bay, you could go to any of the what, four or whatever Timmies and order the same thing and end up with four wildly varying coffees. I haven't had this problem with McDonalds, or Tassimo or Keurig for that matter. Making it the old fashioned way in a drip machine, however, I did. I guess maybe if I tried measuring..."

611154,ehg,2011-08-10 23:25:00,2666, McDonald's is closer and i buy the $1.39 small coffee/muffin things. Much better price and quality than Timmies now frozen food or burnt/watery coffee. Developed a hate on for Timmies when they didn't take debit(like everywhere else) over a decade ago but was all i had when coming back from fishing. Timmies=ripoff
611162,blue pickeral,2011-08-11 00:25:00,267,"A few observations....don't want to be holier than thou but when I see the size of the servings at Sonic Restaurants on the U.S. television, wonder how anyone can eat all that!  -Since McDonald's 'remodelled' the stores to appear to be more 'upscale?' service has slowed right down. Their coffee has improved from the days when their supplier didn't want it to be known who they were...  -The only Tim Horton's to go bankrupt to be saved by the parent company (at least at the time I was there) was in Yellowknife. For some reason, during -40 celcius temperatures, customers didn't want to wait in a long line up which stretched into the parking lot, while only one cashier was working and the rest signed off at the end of a shift which occured at 7:30 am. The busiest time of day for a coffee outlet? Between 6:30 and 9 am.  -The worst Tim Horton's I ever went to was the one in NOrth Bay by the tourism center at the junction of 11 and 17. Three cold cups of coffee in a row, once waiting 15 minutes while the only server finished cleaning the floor. I will never go back. I hope no one else does either.  -The Starbucks cup referred to earlier is definitely worth the $20 it costs.  -Be prepared for various prices for the same product....the summer help is heading back to school which means training new staff. At least this is the explanation in Gravenhurst."
