The perch and pike werent really worth a picture lol.  Got the walleye trolling old trusty, the only rig that seems to produce on that lake when the bite is slow and the bass was caught casting a crank into some heavy cover. That hog put up a solid fight too and took a few good runs. I forgot to rotate the pics.   The bass weighed exactly 5 3/4lbs and measured out to 20 3/4""  it's by far my PB "
