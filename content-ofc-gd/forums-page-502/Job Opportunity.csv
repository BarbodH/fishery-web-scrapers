610248,bushart,2011-08-08 15:33:00,2628,Is'nt the MOE in the middle of a big lay-off?  Something like 700 workers---apparently eng. Bios and such
610253,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 15:47:00,5784," Environment Canada is, not sure about MOE yet...they are awaiting the call. The layoff of Gov workers pushes things into the private sector, basically our conservatives are like the USA's republicans..small governement, bigger business... I digress.  This is private sector. As long as people keep spilling, this job will be around."
