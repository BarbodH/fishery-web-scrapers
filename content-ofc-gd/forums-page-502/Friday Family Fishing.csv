I say is it raining she says no its 5 degrees outside I am not going out in that, rolls over goes back to sleep.  So we hit the water around 9 am fished till 12:30pm.  No monsters but around 20 fish today most in the 1-2.5 lb range.  My son has figured out that if he nets it then he can hold it for a picture so he has started grabbing everyones fish and posing with them LOL.  I tried some new things today.  TIed on a chigger craw and worked the hles in branches of a fallen tree.  I was about 6 inches from the tree would pick a hole drop it down.  I have seen this on TV but I am always worried about spooking fish.  Well it works was in about 3-4 feet of water and landed 2 using this method.  All fish were caught on Senkos, chigger craws and topwater frogs.   Ian                                  "

My first question was answered in 4th last pic YES your son is a weird or crazy as mine Mikey will also wear long sleeves and pants all summer but looses his shirt right away so its pants and no shirt gotta love them kids.
611696,nroadrunner,2011-08-12 20:23:00,113,Mike p the long sleeves are my fault I told him to put them on this morning...  I meant overtop of a t shirt but somehow that got lost in translation.  So all he had was a long sleeve today.    Ian
