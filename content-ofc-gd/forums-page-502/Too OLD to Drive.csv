611374,Billy Bob,2011-08-11 18:37:00,5865,Went to Lowes and here's how this OLD woman parked her car....I think she should rethink about driving any longer. 
611375,Spiel,2011-08-11 18:44:00,9065,Hahahaha....that's beautiful!
611380,fishnsled,2011-08-11 18:54:00,3520,Best spot in the lot I'd say. No one is parking beside you and scratching up your doors.
611382,Headhunter,2011-08-11 19:12:00,5703,Did she ask you if you have a dog BB? HH
611383,Joey,2011-08-11 19:21:00,9122,"Yep, perfect, and she doesn't have to go far to put her cart back"
611384,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-11 19:24:00,10439,And people wonder why the states is in trouble..............she's probably one of your elected officials
611387,craigdritchie,2011-08-11 19:26:00,1586,How come we don't see that in a Grey Power insurance commercial?
611442,Billy Bob,2011-08-11 21:08:00,5865, I think you're right....Oba....something...
611452,smally21,2011-08-11 21:46:00,993,"i've been to a few interesting old-timer wrecks - several of which involve punching their vehicles INTO the store.  85 year old in my town drove into the beer store right up to the counter!  88 year old downtown right thru the pharmacy window, thru the store into the stockroom.  wish i had pics - and they probably wouldn't hit the greypower set!"
611461,misfish,2011-08-11 22:42:00,29133,"   Are you saying he wont be back? I think he will.   He,s trying to clean up a mess left by Busch."
611462,irishfield,2011-08-11 22:47:00,26272,Instead of taking a picture and making a fool... you should have offered to valet park it for her and walk her to the store door Bob ! You'll be that old sooooner than you think!
611468,cranks bait,2011-08-11 23:18:00,721,"Wow, I didn't realize we had a Lowe's here in Brockville?  Nothing out of the norm there.  It's a driving and parking free for all here."
611537,Billy Bob,2011-08-12 10:31:00,5865, I do that every Tuesday already as I drive our town senior van once a week taking the seniors shopping. to the senior center and doctor appointments....that's why I think this lady needs to surrender her drivers license.
611546,Roy,2011-08-12 11:20:00,13728,Calm down everyone. Look at the car then look at the grade. What's that about a 6o incline? Look at how the 30 year old parked the Chevy truck.
611547,Dave Bailey,2011-08-12 11:23:00,1641," No, it's a camera that wasn't held level."
611548,Roy,2011-08-12 11:28:00,13728,I always suspected Bob wasn't on the level.
611549,Billy Bob,2011-08-12 11:32:00,5865,Yea......that's probably me holding my cell phone camera....the parking lot is level there.
611550,Billy Bob,2011-08-12 11:33:00,5865, BINGO.....
611627,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-12 15:16:00,10439,  The only place I have seen parking lots that aren't level are in Yellowknife!!!!
611649,dave524,2011-08-12 16:57:00,4508," We got one here  take your groceries to the vehicle, open the door turn back to get the groceries out of the cart.....GONE  the store needs to install those wheels with the locking tabs on them or supply wheel chocks  Body shops in town must make a fortune in touching up scratches"
