611929,bow slayer,2011-08-13 22:04:00,1074,I am driving from London area to Pembroke in the morning. Seeing there is no highway that directly gets you close i was wondering if anyone has done this that has a route they find the best/quickest? I was thinking 401 til to Bellville than taking 37 or would be taking 41 at Napanee work better?Any routes to save driving time would be greatly apprciated. thanks
611933,irishfield,2011-08-13 22:08:00,26272,London... 401.. 115... 28...onto 62 at Bancroft..onto 60 in Barry's Bay..41 into the 'broke. You SHOULD be going against cottage country traffic most of the way on a Sunday.
611936,bow slayer,2011-08-13 22:18:00,1074,What about 401 to 400 to Huntsville then 60 to Pembroke? thanks

Not necessarily the fastest, although there are plenty of passing lanes now on 17, which is preferable in my opinion to getting stuck behind a manure spreader on the 2 lane highways mentioned above....but you also get to stop at the Riverview Lunch, on highway 17, just east of Mattawa, proximate to Valois Motel....very excellent Bison/Buffalo burgers.
