611901,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-13 19:40:00,10439," You are correct but with it in plain sight there are too many people that will freak out (especially in places like Southern Ontario, Vancouver etc.) Also the fact that he is riding a bike it would just be easier to use a gun boot rather than sling it over his shoulder while driving down the highway. He should also have a lock on the case just so he can stop in and buy gas, go into Timmies etc. without having to carry his firearm into the store. Remember he is using a bike not a car. When I'm running around during hunting season my gun is on the floor in the back seat. The OP doesn't have a back seat or a floor."
611969,Billy Bob,2011-08-14 01:24:00,5865," In a way I agree and then in a way I DON'T........we are giving way too much of OUR RIGHTS to the nut cases......OH....there are many who will say I'm the Redneck nut case but in Arizona where they passed a LAW to check ""ILLEGALS"" when stopped for a routine traffic infraction, then that's wrong....  How we bend over backwards to those who haven't built either of our GREAT COUNTRIES....  And YES you can THANK ME for the cause of this thread closing....  Bob"
612010,GoneFishin,2011-08-14 05:54:00,349,The question I would be asking is would the police pull over a guy on a crotch rocket with dead animals tied to it
612035,smally21,2011-08-14 12:44:00,993,not if they are wearing helmets....   and i'd be surprised to hear it's legal to leave a firearm in the bikerack outside the Tim Hortons.
612036,Terry,2011-08-14 12:46:00,14456,the animal?
612056,ch312,2011-08-14 16:35:00,1590," x2  i can legally toss my unloaded 870 over my shoulder, hop on my enduro, and drive through city streets to get to my hunting area. would i? hell no. you're just asking for headaches from ignorant folks that have no clue, including MANY cops. i'd simply trigger lock it and use a soft case to keep it out of site.  you can walk, ride a bike, atv (if atv is legal on your roads), e-bike, motorcycle, car, truck, etc with your firearm and be fully legal unless your city has a no firearm bylaw (unheard of?).   this is directly from the rcmp website...  http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/PDF/storage-entreposage-eng.pdf  Transporting Firearms Safely  Non-restricted firearms  Unload your firearms. Muzzleloaders can be kept loaded when being transported between hunting sites, but the firing cap or flint must be removed.  Restricted and prohibited firearms  Unload the firearms; and Attach secure locking devices to the firearms; and Lock the firearms in a sturdy, non-transparent container; and Remove the bolts or bolt carriers from any automatic firearms (if removable). Obtain an Authorization to Transport (call 1-800-731-4000).   Leaving any class of firearms in an unattended vehicle  Lock non-restricted firearms and locked containers carrying restricted or prohibited firearms in the trunk or in a similar lockable compartment. If the vehicle does not have a trunk or lockable compartment, put firearms and firearm containers out of sight inside the vehicle and lock the vehicle. If you are in a remote wilderness area and cannot lock your non-restricted firearms inside your vehicle, unload them and put them out of sight. Attach a secure locking device to the firearms unless they are needed for predator control.  Shipping firearms   Firearms must be unloaded, packaged and shipped without ammunition in a safe and secure manner to prevent accidents and deter loss or theft."
612102,Sinker,2011-08-14 20:05:00,8692,"Just because some people don't know or understand the gun regs is no reason for me to change how I do things....legally.  If someone has a problem with me having a gun over my shoulder, when it is totally legal to do so, that is his/her perogotive. Why should I hide my lifestyle?? I don't agree with a lot of things they do, but I keep my mouth shut and move on.  If I get harrassed by police because of it, it is harrassment, and will be dealt with accordingly.  I have no problem showing my papers etc that are required if asked, but I have a problem with being held at gunpoint for no reason, other than I am carrying an encased firearm.  S."
611561,BITEME,2011-08-12 12:27:00,1968,Over time im sure there has been a few Law Enforcement types on this board so I have a question for you or someone in the Know  Can I carry my shottie on my bike to go hunting. It will be locked in a locked case secured to the bike and if need be the ammo will be on my person or in another locked case on the bike  LEGAL OR NOT LEGAL That is the Question????????  Peter
611568,dave524,2011-08-12 12:36:00,4508," when you say bike , is it a muscle powered mountain bike or a motorized bike? also are you on trails or public roads? would make a difference."
611572,Nipfisher,2011-08-12 12:47:00,2449,I can ride my quad (4-wheeler) with my gun in a gun boot or in my front grips as long as it is not loaded. Ammo is always on me. 100% legal but not on city streets.
611573,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-12 12:51:00,4399,"You say ""hunting vehicle"" kinda of a stretch calling a bike a hunting vehicle yes!  I would say the local law enforcement types would have issue`s with guys driving motorcycles with shotguns strapped to them!!!"
611575,NAW,2011-08-12 12:51:00,4022,"Good question!  Need to clarify a bit..  Bike = Motorcycle, bicycle, or Quad.  I have been wondering the same thing regarding a on/off road dirt bike.  I've seen several times up north while grouse hunting, guys riding around with their guns out, no case, riding dirt bikes and quads on the side roads.  I don't know how this would work driving up the 400, or Younge street for that matter."
611579,Joeytier,2011-08-12 13:12:00,3990,"So long as you're in the bush, I wouldn't think twice about it.  Trigger locks might be a good idea."
611586,BITEME,2011-08-12 13:28:00,1968,"Motorcycle, would be traviling provincial/municiple roads to the spot then parking and walk the bush?spot  any ideas"
611587,BITEME,2011-08-12 13:30:00,1968,  In my eyes not even close to a stretch fair game the way I see it besides my horse is at the repair shop  Really very legitimate question  Peter
611604,irishfield,2011-08-12 14:13:00,26272,"Totally legal if not loaded while underway Pete. Now the 911 calls for a ""nutcase on a bike with a gun"" are going to be another thing in todays society !!"
611610,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-12 14:48:00,10439,  Unless you live in the North where it's common place. Even when I lived near Orangeville I would walk down my road with my gun slung over my shoulder (unloaded) while walking to my hunting grounds. In Yellowknife it is the rule rather than the exception to see someone driving through town on their quad or snowmobile toting a firearm.
611621,Terry,2011-08-12 15:05:00,14456,legal  but you will be pulled over by the cops with guns drawn
611622,Joey,2011-08-12 15:06:00,9122,"I don't know, looks perfectly legal to me  "
611631,GBW,2011-08-12 15:21:00,8460,"Legal.  If you have it all locked and it's not loaded then you are good to go.  My cousin hunts all the time and takes his bike to get to the cottage/camp to hunt.  Yes, he has been pulled over too and let go.  True, why else do you think my cousin got pulled over, some call about a crazy guy thinking he was the terminator...  not true.  if you wait to see how the local cop or OPP are coming to you; you can step off with hands raised and tell him/her it's locked and where you have the key.  step away and let them see how it's mounted and locked.  if the cop is nice they will radio to the others in the direction you are going so you don't get pulled over every 20 min.  you can always ask the cop to help you and and advise others in the area if they don't offer.  just smile and be nice no matter what the situation looks like its going to turn into."
611632,Terry,2011-08-12 15:27:00,14456," I want some of what you are smoking  at lest 4 cop cars will pull you over and guns will be drawn  if a cop pulls up beside you and see it, it may go down your way but if a tree huger sees it and calls, it will go down my way"
611642,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-12 16:09:00,10439,Just mount one of these on your bike for transporting your firearm. While they are made for quads it shouldn't be too difficult to rig it up to a 2 wheeler. Store the gun with triger lock in place and you shouldn't have an issue. What's the tree hugger going to say?
611647,Jay T,2011-08-12 16:36:00,282,"I used to do this years ago when I lived further south, and every time I left to go blast some ducks and geese up the road, it wouldn't take long for someone to call the cops! I had a scooter and had it over my shoulder in its case and locked up legally. I had 6 cop cars suround me the one day  I had a good laugh about it anyways, after their guns were put back in their holsters  Good luck"
611648,Bernie,2011-08-12 16:50:00,3190,"Up here I leave my gun boot on my ATV and drive it everywhere. Legal on the streets and secondary highways. Sometimes the gun is in it, sometimes not. Never been checked or pulled over. As long as the cover is on the gun boot and unloaded it is legal. It does not need to be trigger locked as long as you are with the gun. You can have a pocketful of ammunition, just in case you see a partridge."
611651,GBW,2011-08-12 17:01:00,8460,I guess going from Peterborough to Potash Lake is a whole different story then Terry.  That's how it's always been for him.  Maybe his plate has been tagged as far as I know as he get's pulled over less and less each year now.
611652,Dara,2011-08-12 17:08:00,3052,"  Yup. You don't even need a cover except for after dark.  I live in the city and when I go out I just take the gun from my house, no case, and put it on the front seat. When I get back I take it in the house and lock it up. If I leave my truck I am supposed to toss a blanket over the gun and lock the doors. There is no law as I know against having a gun rack in the back window of your pickup and keeping the guns there as long as you put them out of sight and lock the truck when you park it.  Everybody is scared to do that with all the silly misunderstood laws nowadays but its still legal.  I don't know of any law stopping you from carrying a long gun down the street in the city as long as it isn't loaded."
611654,daryl0815,2011-08-12 17:19:00,225, That is awesome!   
611752,cranks bait,2011-08-13 00:55:00,721,I would say legal.  To minimize the phone calls though.  Consider using a guitar case that locks or something that doesn't look like a gun.  Just make sure you tell the officer if you get pulled over.
611835,aplumma,2011-08-13 13:38:00,6896, You promised you wouldn't post the picture of the motorcycle Joe and I are building till we finished it.   Art
611865,Sinker,2011-08-13 15:28:00,8692,"No wonder people don't understand the gun regs. Its threads like this that get people thinking the wrong thing. It is totally legal to carry a gun around, out if its case, in/on any motor vehicle during daylight hours. (half hour before sunrise until a half hour after sunset) I could drive around town with my shotgun on the front seat all day long, it is totally legal. It must be unloaded of course, but totally legal to have it out in plain view in my vehicle.   A half hour after sunset until a half hour before sunrise, you can still have your gun in/on any motor vehcile, as long as its in its case.  No need for any kind of locks either. Locking your gun is only required for storage. If your with your gun, it doesn't have to be locked at all.  S."
611892,smally21,2011-08-13 18:31:00,993,you should try it and if you get in trouble just tell the officer you performed your due diligence and learned all you need to know about gun laws by asking questions of speculators on a fishing website. i'm sure they will let you off.  if you really want to know call the CFO and ask there is a 1-800 #.  hey joey is there a website i can order that bike from?
611900,blarg,2011-08-13 19:37:00,289,"  The correct answers have already been given, perfectly legal.  That doesn't mean you won't get hassled, but it is legal."
