611499,Ron,2011-08-12 01:39:00,1683,"Kewl Roy!  Like you said, to see that last part of the clip, sweat to GOD that bird was riding a skateboard!   Cheers, Ron..."
611503,mercman,2011-08-12 02:07:00,7054,bloody awesome
611509,Nipfisher,2011-08-12 02:50:00,2449,tres cool.
611513,GBW,2011-08-12 03:01:00,8460,"Sure did look like it, HAHAHA!  Every time a bird hit the water I kept hearing 'cannonball' in my mind too..."
611525,Joeytier,2011-08-12 05:09:00,3990,Can't believe they got the underwater shot.  Awesome!
611526,bobowski,2011-08-12 06:27:00,360,"Wow, That's very cool. That last fish has to be at least 5 pounds. Watching this got me thinking about a type of bird I see all the time on southern Georgian Bay. Can anyone help me out with identifying it? It basically looks like a seagull but it has a bright orange beak. The cool thing about this bird is the way it catches fish. The bird hovers over shallow water about 80 feet above the water until it spots its prey. Then all of a sudden it free falls straight down to the water making a huge splash and most of the time it comes up and fly's away with a pan fish. I love to watch these birds hunt on a sunny day while looking out over the bay with a cold one in my hand. It can be very entertaining."
611538,farsider,2011-08-12 10:37:00,456,Sounds like a Tern.  Mark
611542,Handlebarz,2011-08-12 11:02:00,3790,"that was awesome it reminds me when I was out in BC and they released 120,000 trout into the river it was not long before a Eagle was there taking advantage I had some cool shots but they are long gone now. I would think they are still on the old,old, old board as that is where I had up loaded them to."
611556,Joeytier,2011-08-12 12:07:00,3990,Those would be terns.  Very cool birds.  They love the great lakes.
611559,grimsbylander,2011-08-12 12:22:00,3016,  Terns for sure but have you seen the ospreys up there? There are quite a few in the Minnicog area...look for the giant stick nests.
611750,bobowski,2011-08-13 00:52:00,360,So they are Terns. Thanks guys.
611753,misfish,2011-08-13 01:05:00,29133,Thanks Roy.   Very much enjoyed.
611757,Rizzo,2011-08-13 01:17:00,4754,Altitude...I need altitude...Didn't think he'd get airborne on that last one
611782,NAW,2011-08-13 02:47:00,4022,"Nice Vid..  In my office downstairs, I can clearly hear in to my basement apartment.  5 girls just got back from Barrie's Carib'Fest as I was listening to this video.  Their high pitch cackling, combined with the background noise of this video made for quite the experience!"
