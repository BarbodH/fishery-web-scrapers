611789,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-13 03:11:00,10439,For those of you wondering the kind of stuff you can do with jet boats similar to the one in ccmt's Alberta Pike thread take a look at these videos. While these are both inboard jets the OB versions can run some pretty skinny water as well. They can run some wicked water in both big and small rivers.  Here's a V8 inboard jet on the Payette River in Idaho.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5s1jA9YJlo  And here's a small jetboat with a Merc 200 Sport Jet inboard. As you can see they can go through some pretty skinny water.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybxy8N1Ohag&feature=youtu.be

611829,smally21,2011-08-13 12:59:00,993,"going up the river seems to be a remarkably smooth, controlled ride.  coming back down is just controlled mayhem, nothing you can really do but play along....  cool vids man."
611831,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-13 13:18:00,10439," The boat is built for that kind of abuse. The bottom is 1/4"" aluminum and the keel is 3/8"". On top of that is 1/2"" UMHW sheeting. The things are near bullet proof."
