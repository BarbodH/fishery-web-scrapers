610937,ccmtcanada,2011-08-10 03:42:00,7971,"I had planned this trip to Alberta to see my brother for quite a while now.  I hadn't been into the Rocky Mountains since I was a kid...the same age as Sydney is now.  I never forgot how absolutely amazing it all was.  Anyhow, I will let the pictures tell the story.  I'm hoping the memories I've held since I was a kid are kept within my little one for years to come.  This is only a fraction of the pictures I have taken!  Driving from Calgary towards Banff     A few from the top of Sulphur Mountain, Banff.     A few from Johnston's Canyon     Lake Louise...we rented a canoe and paddled out there...     Athabasca Glacier (Columbia Icefields)   Syd and I standing on the glacier   Maligne Canyon       <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid120.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fo185%2Fccmtcanada%2F2011%2520Alberta%2FVID-20110807-00006.mp4"">  Animals we came across...

610988,Nipfisher,2011-08-10 12:48:00,2449,"I grew up on the other side (British Columbia) and looking at the Rockies never grows old. I drove to Alberta in 1998 and stayed in Banff. The highlight of that trip was a visit at Bow Lake. Standing on the dock you could toss a shiny coin (nickel, dime, quarter) into the lake and watch it sink to the bottom which was something like 20 feet. That blue water od Lake Louise reminded me of that. Thanks. Great report."
611003,ccmtcanada,2011-08-10 13:41:00,7971," Mike..it's been a great summer!  We are still here in Alberta...just outside of Red Deer.  Today we go to the West Edmonton Mall to visit the indoor waterpark and amusement park...and the new Cabelas that just opened up!   When I was 10, my family drove from Vancouver back to Ontario...the memories are still fresh from when I was a kid!   As great as some of the pictures turned out, the pale in comparison to seeing them.  You feel so ""small"" when you are in that setting...and visually overwhelmed!   That's what she kept on saying...""WOW!!"".  And of course I had to look at everything she was seeing...""DADDY LOOK!!!!""   The blue water is incredible to see.  We asked the park official if it was ok to fill a water bottle up with the runoff from the glacier and she said it was fine.  It's amazing how clear and clean the water is...and cold!"
611030,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-10 15:20:00,2690,"Spectacular!  I've done the drive once...Vancouver Island back to Ontario, would love to do it again someday, with some extra time to stop and truly enjoy it!"
611087,blaque,2011-08-10 19:25:00,2419," Thats always the way.  Thats what makes them even more impressive, because even just the pics look overwhelmingly breathtaking . I couldnt even imagine how humbled Id feel actually standing there in front of all that."
611144,misfish,2011-08-10 22:26:00,29133,Those are some great pics.
611146,Terry,2011-08-10 22:47:00,14456,great scenery out there looks like a great time
611187,ccmtcanada,2011-08-11 02:01:00,7971,Brian and Terry...thanks!  So many photo opportunities...thank goodness for digital cameras now!  Can take all you want and delete the ones that don't turn out instead of taking rolls and rolls of film hoping you got a few nice ones!
611334,Leecher,2011-08-11 16:23:00,7832,Only words that comes to mind is WOW & INCREDIBLE Loved all the pics    but the shot of Lake Louise and the two of you in the canoe is priceless  the water is aqua Thanks for sharing your wonderful trip!!! Jacques
611377,Spiel,2011-08-11 18:50:00,9065,Outstanding Cliff.  Thanks for sharing.
611409,Big Cliff,2011-08-11 20:14:00,6899,I am so glad to hear that you and Sydney are enjoying the time that you are spending together exploring the wonders of our beautiful country. Thanks for sharing those wonderful pictures!
611528,Jet,2011-08-12 07:38:00,364,You're just a few hours from Kimberley! Lake Louise is a stunning place to visit. Did you hike up to the Tea House!?
611544,ccmtcanada,2011-08-12 11:12:00,7971," I just saw your report and said the same thing...that I was close to your restaurant!!  Wish I knew about it sooner!  We didn't hike to the Tea House as I had my little one with me, but one day when I have more time (3 days isn't enough to truly experience all there is to do between Banff and Jasper), I'd love to hike more!"
