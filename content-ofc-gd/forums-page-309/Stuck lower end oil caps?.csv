786659,tb4me,2013-05-15 01:51:00,3295,Hey how is everyone today?....So on the weekend I decide to get the stuff to change the lower end unit gear oil. I got new washers and enough gear oil to do the job. Then I tried to get the bottom cap out of the gear case..That's where I had to stop. I had a big wide screwdriver and no go. I don't want to destroy the screw-cap trying to get it off. So I have decided to wait till next weekend to complete the job. I wanted to check in here to see how you folks get them out? Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

786666,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-15 02:15:00,10439,Stick your screwdriver in the offending drain plug and while putting counter clockwise (lefty loosy) give the handle of the screwdriver a couple of raps with a hammer. This should break it loose. If not you may need to give it a whack with one of these. 
786669,Bernie,2013-05-15 02:18:00,3190,Back when I was working on outboards I kept an impact driver with the proper blade on it just for doing these.  Impact driver  Drifter beat me to it.
786673,Sinker,2013-05-15 02:30:00,8692,How big was your screwdriver? You need a bigger one  S.
786674,captpierre,2013-05-15 02:31:00,2521,one guy press the largest screwdriver into the screw.  Buddy lock  a visegrip on the screwdriver shaft and twist left.
786676,4x4bassin,2013-05-15 02:53:00,1025,"Like others have said , get the biggest screwdriver in there with lots of downward pressure ."
786680,SBCregal,2013-05-15 03:45:00,688,try and find a screwdriver with a hex on the shaft near the handle.  that way you can get a wrench on it for some extra torque.
786721,Raf,2013-05-15 13:07:00,3495,"these are a PITA. i'm struggling with mine too. gonna try it again this wknd.largest slot screwdriver i've been able to find has a 3/8"" wide head but I think 1/2"" would work even better.almost need one of them old school drag link sockets.    the impact driver would work but i've not been able to find a bit with a wide enough head.. and i don't want to mess up the screw in there using a too-small head."
786724,fisher,2013-05-15 13:21:00,451,"I usually change the oil at the end of the season before storing for the winter in case of water could freeze/cause cracking.  But as for your question, get yourself a drill with a bit that fits snug so to minimize any slipping/stripping of the head (on low torque), but hand tighten with a larger screw driver when putting back on."
786786,aplumma,2013-05-15 20:09:00,6896,Smacker hand impact like Drifter pictured and Bernie has confirmed is what I have always used with success.   Art
786796,davey buoy,2013-05-15 21:07:00,5505,"Me too,that's what I use."
786797,bigbuck,2013-05-15 21:10:00,2449,IMPACT WRENCH all the way!! I had the same problem with the lower unit on my boat a year and a half ago when I did my own lower unit oil. It zipped off like nothing.
786799,tb4me,2013-05-15 21:13:00,3295,Cool I will try the bigger screw driver first. I went to cdn tire and bought the biggest screwdriver I could find and took it to the bench grinder. It now has a big wide fat tip on it..If that don't work ill try the impact tool. I also went back to Dundas Marine in Waterdown today and bought new screws. These have a hex type head instead of a slot..
786800,bigbuck,2013-05-15 21:15:00,2449,"Oh yeah, replace the gasket!! A replacement screw can be had for a few bucks. Keep one handy just in case the old one gets mangled."
786806,lew,2013-05-15 21:59:00,12766,"When putting the plugs back in, they only need to be snugged down, no need to really lean on them."
786831,mr blizzard,2013-05-15 23:25:00,1589,"Real men use their thumbnail.......LOL As mentioned the impact works great but I have also had good luck with a vice grip on the end of a screwdriver, as Lew said dont overtighten"
