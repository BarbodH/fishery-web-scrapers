I bought some GIANT minnows that morning for bait and was confident we could hook into a big Pike.Well we played around in the forest and threw sticks for the dog and with only five minutes left before i had to head off for work the rod tip registered a bite, I struck, and landed a pike almost the same size as the bait it apparently inhaled.ICE OUT IN FULL SWING NOWWE SET UP THE RODPLAYED WHILE WE WAITED FOR A BITEAND WERE REWARDED WITH A SMALL PIKE "
786256,ehg,2013-05-13 14:40:00,2666,Really liked this little report. Your dog chasing the pike at end of video is great.

786305,fishnsled,2013-05-13 19:55:00,3520,Roloff does seemed a bit perplexed as to where the fish went.     Great to see some open water up there for you finally Simon.  Should have the boat in by the weekend.
786379,pidge,2013-05-14 01:27:00,438,Haha funny vid near the end. Nice report LimeyAngler. Pikes really light in colour. At least to me.
786407,limeyangler,2013-05-14 02:13:00,5204,"  Thanks man. Yup, the lake we are on is like chocolate milk in color, all the fish are very pale color because of that."

786419,Joey,2013-05-14 02:37:00,9122,Great stuff Simon.  Roloff seemed to want a bit more play time with the pike!
786624,Twocoda,2013-05-14 23:48:00,4130,Nicely done Simon...i went swimming and caught a cold...Jack is growing before our eyes
