I'm not concerned about not catching fish necessarily, I just want to avoid being the guy in a bassboat upsetting people if there is truly not a pike population worth pursuing."

786342,Rich,2013-05-13 22:33:00,3927,"There is a catchable population of pike in the harbour, for sure."
786474,grimsbylander,2013-05-14 11:46:00,3016,Thanks Rich. I'll give it a try one night this week. It looks like a great place to teach my son how to drive the boat too. That includes boat positioning with the electric.
786478,Rich,2013-05-14 11:54:00,3927,"Funny you mention that. My dad taught me to drive a boat there when I was 6. Back then there was a lot of unknown about the harbour, suffice to say pike and bass fishing was a little better. You will see others out pike fishing, and those others out ""pike"" fishing now. And harbour enforcement is stricter, so be careful with your son. But good luck to ya. I know wayyy back when I fished there, we always seemed to get our pike around the Macassa pier... Before it existed. Lol"
