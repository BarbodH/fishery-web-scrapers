After wandering for 10-15 minutes I finally located a small patch near a downed tree that were just sprouting and prime for picking.  After pondering for a minute I decided to check every spot I could find in the area on the north side of downed trees, heavy brush, etc and ended up with just over 3 lbs in about 45 minutes. Apparently the plants in shaded areas are way behind those in sunny areas and by the looks of thing's i'll be able to go picking again in a few days as I saw many that are still buried in the ""knobs"" and about to sprout.  Get out there before it's game over until next spring"

Some areas are ferned-out, while others are a week away from starting.  Not sure if it was posted here already, but this is a good preparation instructional  "

786204,Big Cliff,2013-05-13 10:39:00,6899,Went out last week and got a nice bunch of wild leeks and a good size bag of fiddleheads. It was still about a week early though where we pick them. Black flies were really thick though.
