786693,Fisherman,2013-05-15 11:23:00,7201,"If he keeps the pikes jaws shut long enough, the pike can't ""breath"" and will die of oxygen starvation."
786698,Moosebunk,2013-05-15 11:37:00,3970,Who doesn't eat a giant pike the size of yourself every morning for breakfast???

786860,Roy,2013-05-16 00:40:00,13728,"Don't kid yourselves. That pike can do nothing against that weasel. We tend to think of otters as cute and playful and yes, they seem to be as we see them sliding down snow trails. The otter can easily break that pike's back with his teeth. The otter can also stay underwater for long periods of time and swim as well if not better than the pike. My money's on the otter."
