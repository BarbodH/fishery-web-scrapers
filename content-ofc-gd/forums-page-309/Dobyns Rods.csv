785530,Chance,2013-05-09 20:41:00,420,If combined with the correct reel why would it not be well balanced?
785536,Sinker,2013-05-09 21:13:00,8692,"Can't you balance any rod with the right reel?  I dunno, you guys can use your fancy stuff. My mixed bag of gear works fine. You'd probably laugh at some of my gear, but the bottom line is I catch fish  Its not the rods that do the catching.  S."
785545,Lape0019,2013-05-09 21:46:00,647,"Lol!!! I haven't jumped into the world of custom rods yet but if and when I do, I will be contacting you. The amount of people speaking highly of your work, I don't think I could go wrong...  In the mean time, you will not find a better balanced rod than a Dobyns and I will be sticking with them."
785548,Chance,2013-05-09 21:58:00,420,Never laugh at a man catching fish !!
785608,TrippyJai,2013-05-10 02:19:00,28,"I am very picky with my gear so I'm glad Dobyns got it right. It's about balance and while there are lighter rods out there, they've really missed the mark on that aspect. I also prefer a full cork handle and ECS reels seats so that's a plus for me. They also use decent grade cork for a shelf rod. Overall, it's everything I want in a rod since these days every company are moving away from cork and to split grips."
785933,DropShot'r,2013-05-11 23:21:00,62,"Thanks to everyone that made suggestions for my new crankbait rod.  The winner is: Dobyns Champion 805CB RM with a Lews Super Duty.  Yes Frank, Ed talked me into a Lews.  Drop"
785936,Lape0019,2013-05-12 00:07:00,647,"Hey Drop,  I know you already know the quality of the Dobyns champion series so good call in that. I have yet to buy a rod that long but a few people I have talked to really like that rod.  I am trying a lew's this year for the first time as well. I grabbed a team gold speed spool and if it works half as good as it looks, I will be impressed. Between Frank and Marc, they seem to have a severe addiction to those reels so they can't be half bad... I have given up hope with shimano when it comes to $200 to $300 reels so hopefully the gold fits that ticket."
785938,Chance,2013-05-12 00:47:00,420,"Have you considered the BB1 in the 5.1:1 for crankin ? It is what I use and it is awesome. It does not have the instant anti reverse and when a fish hits you can actually feel it through the handle as it pops backwards a little. you also get a better feel for the action of your bait. For all my other reels I like the tourney pros.They cast a mile and are VERY smooth. In the past I used mainly Cores and Chronarchs,the old ones when they were still decent, and I like the Lews better."
786004,DropShot'r,2013-05-12 14:10:00,62," I was planning to put on a Revo SX on the rod. Their slowest gearing was 6.4:1. Ed didn't have that particular reel in stock and suggested the Lews to me. The gear ratio was my fault. I should have asked, I didn't. I'm not that concerned about the gear ratio.....ignorance is bliss....LOL!!!"
783960,mbac31,2013-05-02 15:08:00,904,Both Blake at Fishingworld and Jasper at Pro J tackle are great guys to deal with.
784171,Lape0019,2013-05-03 14:38:00,647,"I just added another one to my arsenal.  Here is my current list.  Dobyns Champion 734C full handle - Spinnebaits and buzzbaits. Awesome rod and my first casting and Dibyns rod all in one!!! Dobyns Champion 702SF - Tubes and drop shotting duty Dobyns Savvy 735SC - Frogs, Frogs, and more Frogs. - Great rod with a lot of backbone. It can throw a frog pretty damn far while still looking good Dobyns Champion Extreme 735C FH - This is my new aquisition that beat out the new Megabass rods I was looking atlast night. It will be used for Pitchin mostly but a carolina rig may makes it presence know on the business end of this stick.  IMO, They balance well, look awesome and give me confidence. I do use other brands, but this is my mainstay. Looking forward to seeing how much more sensitive the DX is compared to the Champion."
784219,TheMaverick,2013-05-03 18:38:00,93," Musky_Hunter,  Myself and Lape buy from the same local store, I've heard from a few guys now that the X4 don't balance as well as the XX line up.  I'll give the XX a fair chance (purchasing a Flat Side Special) but my Dobyns will be hard to top!"
785177,snagged,2013-05-08 15:12:00,67,Super excited about the dx 742c full handle I just ordered. Now for the painful waiting game
785185,musky_hunter,2013-05-08 15:35:00,328," I will be getting the 6'8"" jerkbait special. The 7' flat side special was considered but fishing from the back of the boat often the shorter rod would be preferred. It will double as my squarebill rod. For cranks I use a 765cb glass and 733c for lipless and spinnerbaits.  I potentially will buy the 7'5"" and 7'9"" rods."

785210,musky_hunter,2013-05-08 17:43:00,328,
785248,Ainsley,2013-05-08 20:05:00,142,"Musky, I know you've mentioned you're a big fan of the 765cb glass, have you compared it to many other rods? I'm looking to replace my Powell max glass 7'6"" crank rod with one."
785256,StarTzar,2013-05-08 20:35:00,51," Hey Drop,  What is your intended use for the 804CB or 805CB RM? Both rods excel for deep diving cranks. I have the 805CB RM and use it for deep diving cranks. I also throw wake baits and heavy shallow cranks."
785259,musky_hunter,2013-05-08 20:48:00,328,"The 765CB Glass shines with baits 3/8oz +. The longer rod allows you to cast cranks a mile. It has a nice parabolic bend but a strong backbone, hard to find in most cranking sticks. This rod shines with a fish on, I landed a 45"" muskie no problem. Paired with a 7-8oz reel and it balances perfectly, amazingly light feeling. In my mind Dobyns makes one of the best cranking rods.  I haven't tried it for spinnerbaits but i've read it's also very good.  I've never used a powell rod, sorry."
785410,DropShot'r,2013-05-09 11:16:00,62,"Frank,  I have read from several sources that the 805CB RM was designed by Randy to specifically fish deep divers. I have also read that the 804CB will handle deep divers but is more for shallow to medium divers. Specifically I will be throwing square-bills and medium divers and Lucky Craft wake-baits most times, although I plan on getting a 10XD to try out as well as a Flash Mob Jr. umbrella rig ( I will need to snip one wire off to be legal in Ontario) I will appreciate any of your thoughts  on this matter. I will also run this by Ed before the purchase as well.  Thanks, Steve"
785431,Lape0019,2013-05-09 13:10:00,647," Hey Drop,  I imagine the 804 would be fine for everything you listed other than maybe the umbrella rig. Talking to Ed may help there but I am not sure if he has even thrown one. As for the umbrella rig itself, Ed has ontario legal ones at the shop but even if you buy the one you want, you don't have to snip any wires off. You could use spinner blades or just cut the hook off of one or two of the jig heads. The rules stipulate how many hooks per bait and not how many wires are allowed on a bait."
785432,Chance,2013-05-09 13:12:00,420,"I throw the 10XD on an 805 and it handles it well without issue. I like my DD Normans alot and throw the 22's on my 765 Glass and once again operates like a charm. Ainsley I think you will like the Dobyns compared to the Powells. Its hard to put a handle on and I am sure you can relate but they give you a confident feeling. Aside from balance,durability ,flex and all the other categories they just feel right ! I have fished alot of the rods that are popular in the US and not so up here and I really like the Dobyns line up.  Not to mention Gary is a great guy , down to earth and stands by his product."
785433,Chance,2013-05-09 13:13:00,420,Most guys I know throwing them just add the spinner blade as you mentioned.
785435,Chance,2013-05-09 13:18:00,420," Bit of an individual thing with the BB1 . I know guys who love them,myself included and others who just cannot get used to how they handle. if you are close enough feel free to drop me a PM and give mine a whirl."
785436,Sinker,2013-05-09 13:21:00,8692,Where did these Dobyns rods come from? Sounds like a new fad to me. How long they been around for? Long enough to be proven worthy yet?  S.
785439,musky_hunter,2013-05-09 13:39:00,328,"They are designed by Gary Dobyns and they are definitely not a fad. They have been in the US a long time and starting to get very popular in canada.  http://dobynsrods.com/about-us/  The rods are above most USDM offerings and have excellent customer service. You have to feel the balance on these rods. Do a quick search on tackletour, UB, or BBC.  Go to your local dealer and pick one up and try."
785452,Sinker,2013-05-09 14:41:00,8692,"Meh......I'm of the opinion that if a person knows how to catch fish, any decent rod will do. I don't get caught up in the fancy high end stuff. I do fine without it.  S."
785457,Chance,2013-05-09 15:53:00,420,"Fish with what you like and what you can afford I say. If you want to just make do and that is your style of fishing why not. Rods are like shoes ,what is good for you might be terrible for me. I have fished for many years on both sides of the border and been lucky enough to be able to try all manufacturers at one time or another. High end,low end and in between. I prefer Dobyns rods ,I like Gary and I like his company . He stands behind his product and if any issues arise he will take care of them as soon as possible.I cannot say that for some of the others I have used."
785497,Lape0019,2013-05-09 18:12:00,647,"I will echo that they are not a fad.  The gen 2 rods have been around for around 5 years ( that I know of) but the gen 1 rods have been around for a while. The gen 1 rods were having breakage issues so Gary pulled them off the market and started over again. He still honoured the warranties with the gen 1's and he hasn't had the qc issues he had with the first gen. He switched manufacturing companies and quality went way up. I have used both the savvy series and the champion series so far and I love them. As stated before, I have just bought a Dobyns champion extreme that I am looking forward to suing this year. It balanced better than a glx, the megabass x4 destruction, and a slew of other high end rods.  The nrx balanced better but was almost $600 and wasn't rated for anything over 3/4 of an ounce. The cumura balanced about the same but it has a few components that I do not like when compared to the champion extreme.  As for warranty, I don't think there is a better one on the market at this point."
785501,musky_hunter,2013-05-09 18:30:00,328,"Balance is the key to dobyns rods, hard to find a better balanced rod for the price. The new Megabass XX are very balanced too, i think even more than the x4 rods i've felt."
785516,StarTzar,2013-05-09 20:02:00,51,"Steve,  I agree with Adam (Lape0019), The 804CB is probably a better all around (medium to deep cranks) than the 805CB RM. I have an 805CB RM and I have tried it for medium square bill cranks and it works OK but it excels for deep cranking. I use a 764CB RM for medium diving cranks.  The 804CB being (8-17lb, 1/4-1oz, Medium/Mod Fast ) will work better (IMHO) for the medium diving cranks than the 805CB RM which is (10-20lb, 3/8-1 1/2oz, Med/Hvy Mod/Fast).  As for the umbrella rigs, talk to Ed. He was out with Gary Dobyns and I do believe they were throwing the umbrella rigs. I can't remember what rod they were using."
785521,StarTzar,2013-05-09 20:07:00,51,I totally agree with you. $250 to $350 is the max I will spend on a rod. Same for my reels. Anything over that price range is fancy high end stuff that I keep away from.
785524,Lape0019,2013-05-09 20:19:00,647,"This is 100% accurate, the xx line came in at the same time as the x4's Ed had special ordered and I was really looking forward to the 7'2 destruction but it was a little tip heavy with the Core I was planning on mounting on it. The xx line balanced almost the same as the DX I ended up with. The difference was not quite noticeable. It was that close but after spending 20 minutes trying to figure out which one to grab, I went with the Dobyns. The reasoning was basically it balanced a tad bit better, has a lifetime warranty against defects as opposed to 3 years, and IMO, looks a hell of a lot better. Plus I have experience with the Dobyns product and it has not let me down...  Adam"
785526,Spiel,2013-05-09 20:28:00,9065,Nonsense is what I say to an off the shelf rod in regards to balance.  Think about it!

783250,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:52:00,93,"I'll start,  745 DX, I'll be using it for pitching, heard and read nothing but good things on this rod for heavier plastics. 743 DX, Good all around rod for weightless plastics, senkos, horny toads.  "

783380,Ainsley,2013-04-30 02:28:00,142,I started getting into dobyns rods last season.  Started with a DX744 mostly for spinnerbaits. Then came a dx743 for senkos. Both are amazing rods. Since then I've picked up a champion 702c and 765c which I have yet to fish. Up next is a 704cb for jerkbaits and topwaters and a 765cb glass for deep cranks. Still trying to figure out my reel pairings for all these rods
783411,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-30 09:43:00,8243,"Maverick and Star Tzar, exactly what are you 2 selling? With all that gear as Sheriff Brady said ""We're gonna need a bigger boat."""
783424,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 10:34:00,93, and that's exactly what we did
783434,StarTzar,2013-04-30 11:41:00,51,That's why we purchased the Ranger. The rod lockers are much larger than that of the Stratos.
783435,StarTzar,2013-04-30 11:42:00,51,The 704CB is an excellent choice for jerkbaits and is great for top water.
783443,Chance,2013-04-30 12:31:00,420,"You could be right !  Just got my latest order from Lews yesterday. I love the new BB1 for cranking,a really nice feel to it and you can really feel the bait working.
