786520,woodenboater,2013-05-14 15:11:00,2277,crap. don't wanna jump to conclusions but the fact that Millard's not talking says a lot. hope they can figure out who the second guy was and deal with these wastes of human lives appropriately.

786529,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-14 15:57:00,8243,They've set up a second forensic tent. 2nd suspect?  What are we coming to? Prayers to the family and friends.  A second press conference at 2:30 today.
786533,Loonietoon,2013-05-14 16:08:00,1450,This is total Bull there was no need for this type of finish.. Just went through this same thing not even 2 months ago with a friend of my Daughters.. Burned the body also.. Bring back the Death Penalty Never thought I would ever say that.  Sorry for the response.
786534,Oryx,2013-05-14 16:11:00,186,My condolences to the family.  My heart goes out to a 2yr old girl who no longer has a father.
786543,Tim Mills,2013-05-14 17:00:00,476,"A shame that a family had to lose a father, son and husband so a rich kid could have another toy to play with. I hope the press has the decency to leave the Bosma family alone."
786559,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-14 18:50:00,8243,"Hamilton police press conference 2:30PM  Police statement now, warrants being executed, extensive investigation/waterloo and Brantford police.

Many other police services offering help,  120 officers on ground this AM  Listen to people talking call tip line with info.

Notes taken live.    ."
786563,lew,2013-05-14 18:56:00,12766,I've been outside all day and haven't heard any news so this is the 1st I've heard about him being found dead.  What a lousy tragedy  Why on earth would anybody kill a man over a crummy used truck ??
786565,davey buoy,2013-05-14 18:59:00,5505,"Really,what was the reasoning is what I would like to know."
786567,Lunatic,2013-05-14 19:11:00,536,there has to be more to it then this.that kid could have bought 100 of those trucks new with his fat account.maybe past dealings or maybe he did it for kicks. either way he should die.
786568,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-14 19:22:00,8243,"As I said before there is a lot to this story. If this was a murder for thrill it is usually by 1 perpetrator, there are at least 2 others involved, unusual. They tried to go on a test drive earlier in Etobicoke and balked. That man is very lucky, and his connection is key. Connection as in what was the common denominator with Bosma, Why keep the truck at his mothers in a  trailer, no one steals a vehicle and parks it at their residence, it is usually chopped in a few hours or burnt and what would a used vehicle bring? Where had his truck been prior? Was there something special about it the victim didn't know about? So many questions no answers this soon. Let's hope they get these others and soon."
786576,Rattletrap2,2013-05-14 20:09:00,1652,Definitely a whole lot more to this story than meets the eye! Nothing adds up here. Time will tell.
786583,Handlebarz,2013-05-14 20:33:00,3790,My heart goes out to the family his wife his little girl.  I can't add anything else as it only involves the death penalty and anger.
786584,pics,2013-05-14 20:43:00,1268,"The police have done a fabulous job on this case...I'm confident the others will be caught....the ""justice system"" is another story"
786594,HTHM,2013-05-14 22:20:00,4082,"Coming from the same social circles as the Bosma family, I will not speculate on any of the facts of the case until revealed in court. For the family's sake I suggest all of us do the same."
786656,Rattletrap2,2013-05-15 01:40:00,1652,I certainly did not mean any disrespect to the Bosma family. It is a certain hell that they are going through and my heart goes out to them. I only meant that there is a whole lot more going on here with Dellen Millard and company.
785159,Dave Bailey,2013-05-08 13:28:00,1641,"Checked this on-line and it's legit. Tim Bosma, the vehicle you're looking for is a 2007 black Dodge Ram 3500 with the licence plate 726-7ZW.

785208,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-08 17:37:00,8243,"I saw the press conference, this is strange to say the least. Something you see on CNN from the states, not usually here. Let's just hope he is located and he is unharmed. There has to be more to the story we will learn about when he is home and safe. Man what's next."
785227,esoxansteel,2013-05-08 18:48:00,1307,"Does anyone know if this truck has dual wheels, or just a single rear wheel? might help to narrow a search, they mentioned that it was a common truck, but out of all the Dodge trucks this is likely one thats not as common, as its a specific heavy workload truck. Hope he is found safe and sound"

785721,jimmer,2013-05-10 19:44:00,2730,What the heck is happening to our society. This all over a truck??? I am concerned for his safe return if no one has heard from him yet.
785743,Handlebarz,2013-05-10 22:27:00,3790,This is crazy I hope he is safe.  In Ohio yesterday in Ohio there were three teen boys missing today or late last night one was found but the other two were killed. The news did  not give any more info. These are different times or maybe we all hear more of this crap because of the Internet.

785897,Handlebarz,2013-05-11 18:35:00,3790,@AM980News: THIS JUST IN: Police have arrested a 27 year old man from Toronto in connection to the Tim Bosma missing person case.  Hamilton Police confirm Tim Bosma has not been located.
785918,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-11 21:29:00,8243,"Heard the same thing on 900 CHML this afternoon. Charged with forcible confinement and some other charges, need to find a press release to post here. This is strange to say the least. How did they narrow the suspect down to a specific individual?. Some good police work going on here. Let's just pray he is safe, unfortunately I think it's too late but nabbing a suspect is a huge step to locating him. Those suspects went there for a reason and it wasn't to steal a truck. If he didn't know his kidnappers he knew the person(s) that sent them I believe. Unless this was a pure kidnap for ransom, if that's the case he's still alive unless something went horribly wrong.  Here's a link to charges laid. Looks like social media played a big part by detailing the tattoo on the suspects wrist in my opinion.  http://www.cknw.com/Channels/News/Toronto/story.aspx?ID=1958968"
786168,Rattletrap2,2013-05-13 02:54:00,1652,Strange case for sure. I just saw on CTV news that they have found a trailer at Dellen Millards Mothers residence with a pick-up truck inside.
786170,Rattletrap2,2013-05-13 02:56:00,1652,I'm sure this guy didn't need to steal a used pick-up truck. He is heir to the Millard Air business. Gotta be a lot more to this story and I'm sure it will come out shortly.

786187,Joey,2013-05-13 03:49:00,9122,"Just saw this in the Star:  ""Several police cars were parked through the day in front of the Tinsmith Court home of Madeleine Millard, mother of the man arrested Saturday in connection with Bosma’s disappearance. Neighbours told reporterse they saw police open a large black trailer and then tow it out of the street in the early evening; the neighbours added that officers told them it contained Bosma’s black 2007 Dodge Ram 3500.""    The whole thing is very odd."
