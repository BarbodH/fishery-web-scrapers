786391,woodenboater,2013-05-14 01:46:00,2277,a 3 goal lead...sigh. can't watch.
786392,bobogo,2013-05-14 01:49:00,76,they can do it. Randy caryle knows exactly what to do!
786394,Sinker,2013-05-14 01:53:00,8692,"Come on, be honest with yourselves! They're TOAST!!  Bye bye leafs!  S."
786397,Marty,2013-05-14 01:58:00,873,Rookies.
786398,Angler management,2013-05-14 01:58:00,280,This is crazynessssss!!!!
786400,Sinker,2013-05-14 02:05:00,8692,Told ya!
786401,SirCranksalot,2013-05-14 02:06:00,3291,"Nah, nah, nah, nah---hey hey hey goodbye!!!"
786402,jedimaster,2013-05-14 02:08:00,3472,so messed up
786403,irishfield,2013-05-14 02:08:00,26272,
786415,Acountdeleted,2013-05-14 02:28:00,2562,Unbelievable. I've seen the Gretzky debacle of 93' so this was the second biggest leafs disappointment of my life.
786417,Joey,2013-05-14 02:34:00,9122,Sad and messed up!!!
786420,woodenboater,2013-05-14 02:37:00,2277,"guess they'll be around for the opener  hope they can build on this and keep the young turks intact for next season. unfortunately, phaneuf probably should go."
786430,Acountdeleted,2013-05-14 02:47:00,2562,"Everyone keeps saying this. You won't find another defenseman like Phaneuf kicking around in free agency. Should he be getting 6.5? No way. Should he be captain? Probably not, but it will take years to replace him. Maybe when Riley comes up, sure but for now, hold on to him just give him less responsibility."
786439,Dan668,2013-05-14 03:04:00,1120,"He sucks. Flopping all over the ice, always on the side of a bad play.  Unfortunately, the team who wanted it more won."
786471,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-14 11:32:00,8243,"The only game I watched the entire season. Man I feel for you folks, now you know how it feels to be a Bills fan, sort of. There something there for next season to build on, scrappy kids who are quick and like to bang, great combo. Got to give it to Boston, no quit in those kids. The best 3 minute team won."
786481,bobogo,2013-05-14 12:02:00,76, pretty much how I see it as well.
786487,wildeye rainbow,2013-05-14 12:31:00,123,"The Leafs didn't have the ""fire"" or passion the last two minutes.  They should have wanted to get the puck, block the puck and do whatever it takes,..., they didn't and they lost.  Tough loss to take.  WR"
786491,woodenboater,2013-05-14 12:40:00,2277,"While they didn't resort to the old Leaf tradition of falling back with a good lead, I'm having hard time figuring out how they blew a 3 goal lead. Still not much shame in losing to Stanley Cup winners."
786494,SirCranksalot,2013-05-14 13:09:00,3291,They only gave 100%----they should have given it at least 110%!
786505,muskymatt,2013-05-14 14:03:00,2608,"Ahhhhh , what a splendid, beautiful day it is today! Hey, did anyone catch the game last night?"
786507,SirCranksalot,2013-05-14 14:22:00,3291,"Udunno, who won??"
786521,woodenboater,2013-05-14 15:12:00,2277,the Rangers
