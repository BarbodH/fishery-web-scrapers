786445,Twocoda,2013-05-14 03:22:00,4130,This is photoshopped ...i just thought it was kinda cool to play with the land and water....what so you see ?      The Chi Cheemaun still isnt running so we drove over to the island and flew back...

786537,oldphart,2013-05-14 16:22:00,665,~~~If you have any native blood in you the first pic is a good sign. Lake so low the ferry can't cross
786538,Twocoda,2013-05-14 16:30:00,4130,Thanks guys ...only the first pic was heavily photoshopped for the eagles head off of Lions Head....the rest had corrections due to haze and bugs splattered on the window but other then that...the checkered flag is actually hangers at the airport...but now that Roy pointed it out....i can see it too...  No native blood in me ....but mine is human...same as theirs...the lake is actually higher then it was for the latter part of the Chi Cheemauns season last fall...but i dont blame them for shutting it down to correct what can only be worse this year with the water levels...
