785414,misfish,2013-05-09 11:56:00,29133,SWEET VICTORY WHAT A COME BACK. ONE MORE TO GO.
785420,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-09 12:19:00,0,"if colts lead in the 3rd, watch for my goon prediction to come true.  as a season ticket holder in the western conference i see my fair share of london in the regular season.  other that windsor, no team takes losing worse than the knights.  watch for the ruperts to take cheapshots if they are down late.  sportsmanship and ""losing gracefully"" starts with the coach and hunter staarted trying to blame losing on 'barrie diving"" after last game.  interestingly, the knights have had more PP's this series than barrie."
785421,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-09 12:21:00,0,"also, good on the colts.  for years fans have referred to the East as being the weaker conference.  not many, including myself, gave them a chance against the powerhouse that is the london knights.  but it seems scheifele has decided to show that he is a man amongst boys and is dominating the knights.  go colts go (anybody but london)"
785427,Garfisher,2013-05-09 13:01:00,229,"Was at the game last night. I didn't notice any embellishments myself (although I know I missed a couple of the infractions). Both teams played hard last night, there were non calls on trips and even a too many men by the knights. London controlled the 1st 2 periods after Barrie scored on the 1st shift of the game. Niederberger held the Colts in for the entire game, and then the Colts woke up in the 3rd. Ryan Rupert was involved in an altercation with around 34 seconds left, where he was pushed into Niederberger by Laser, and then gave Niederberger a couple shots. London is by no means out of the series, Barrie needs to finish off the Knights as soon as possible, the Knights could easily force a Game 7 (and win) judging by the way they have played in the series"
785441,bow slayer,2013-05-09 14:00:00,1074,funny you mentioned the ruperts my son played 5 years against these 2 in minor hockey( minor peewee til minor midget)....lets just say I seen them goon it up more than a few times over that period.
786100,misfish,2013-05-12 21:17:00,29133,
786108,kickingfrog,2013-05-12 21:54:00,8333,"They sure didn't show up for the first two periods last night, but London has given up a ton of third period goals this series. Tough going into London after loosing 2 in a row, but one game takes all is where it's at."
786236,wildeye rainbow,2013-05-13 13:32:00,123,It will be rockin' at the Bud tonight.  Good luck to both teams.  (I only wished that the Leaf game would have been on Tues. nite)  WR
786321,Ralph Field,2013-05-13 20:51:00,1018,"The Colts have owned the third period, and as a Knight's fan I can only hope London finds a solution to their third period problems."
786511,misfish,2013-05-14 14:35:00,29133,"Colts almost did the third period thing again, but with 0,01 seconds left in the game, London is your OHL CHAMPS.  Great series by both teams."
786635,wildeye rainbow,2013-05-15 00:36:00,123,"Junior hockey is the greatest entertainment value for your buck.  We go to a lot of Jr A and Jr B games.  It's still affordable and you can get tickets unlike the big boys in the ""show"".  It was an entertaining series for sure.  I was full flipper mode last night between the OHL game and the Leaf game.  WR"

783277,davey buoy,2013-04-29 23:19:00,5505,"1-0 for Bellville so far,lets go Colts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
783281,misfish,2013-04-29 23:23:00,29133,Rogers is carrying it by tv COGECO
783322,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 00:58:00,8333,"2-1 colts, 9 min left in 3rd."
783323,Gerritt,2013-04-30 00:59:00,6129,Go Bulls!
783326,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 01:02:00,8333,And they've been your team for a season eh?
783328,wildeye rainbow,2013-04-30 01:02:00,123,"Bulls or Colts,..., see you guys on Friday night down here!"
783338,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 01:17:00,8333,It's on. Colts v. Knights for the OHL title.
783350,mr blizzard,2013-04-30 01:29:00,1589,"Go Colts go, they are still near to my heart."
783351,wildeye rainbow,2013-04-30 01:31:00,123,"It will be a good series for sure.  But I'll have to say, Go Knights Go!"
783370,NAW,2013-04-30 01:53:00,4022,"For sure, that's going to be a solid series!  Go colts go!"
783474,misfish,2013-04-30 15:10:00,29133,"Was a good game played by both teams. Colts goalie earned that one for them. Cup final, will be a tough series."
783482,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-04-30 15:41:00,0,my official prediction...London in 5.
783502,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 16:44:00,8333,"I want to hear the unofficial one as well.  London won the league last year, and are even stronger this year. Tough spot for Barrie but upsets happen more in junior then in the pros.  My buddy in London wants to put a bottle of crown on the series."
783529,NAW,2013-04-30 19:08:00,4022,"Don't do it!!  I love the colts, but I think the nights are going to slam them..."
783532,davey buoy,2013-04-30 19:12:00,5505,"Scheifele will do it,plus some help from the team. Don't worry.lol."
783550,misfish,2013-04-30 20:22:00,29133,"Whats a bottle of the finest ,between friends. You deliver it on a friday,drink it together on a saturday. WIN WIN.LOL  I would do it. Colts in 7"
784278,kickingfrog,2013-05-04 00:44:00,8333, Well the final bet was a box of steaks from his family's farm for a $20 gift card from bps. And we'll share the bottle of crown next visit.
784342,misfish,2013-05-04 15:38:00,29133,We took the first one. Impressive win.
784353,Garfisher,2013-05-04 18:17:00,229,"Niederberger definitely kept them in it last night. The Colts will probably go as far as Niederberger takes them, unless the offence gets shut down."
784379,wildeye rainbow,2013-05-04 21:13:00,123,I was at the Bud last night. Niederberger made at least 4 great saves that would have been goals most nights. He was the difference last night.  Can't wait to see tomorrow's game  WR
784460,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-05 15:19:00,0,"my unofficial prediction is that if Barrie goes up 2-0 in the series, Hunter will send out the goons and turn the series dirty!"
784461,kickingfrog,2013-05-05 15:43:00,8333,He does have the money for it.
784475,davey buoy,2013-05-05 17:08:00,5505,"Heard last night,that franchise makes 10mill a year.Who'd of known?."
784522,wildeye rainbow,2013-05-05 21:52:00,123,"I've followed the Knights forever and have been to most of the Knight's games this year - the Knights do not have ""goons"" that I am aware of.  Maybe they're still at the Ice House (ie. the former rink).  I can't see that if and that's a big if, Barrie goes up 2-0 that the knights are going to play dirty.  If you saw the first game, you would have seen the Knights dominating periods 1 and most of 3 - Barrie had period 2.  The Barrie goalie won the game for the Colts.  Let's see what transpires tonight.....  As far as a successful franchise, the rink sells out at 9,060 each night.  Since the Hunters have owned the Knights they have been exceptionally successful on the ice as well.  I believe Dale Hunter got to the 500 win plateau the quickest of any junior coach.  I'm sure the franchise is worth more than the few million that they paid for it around 2001 or so.   WR"
