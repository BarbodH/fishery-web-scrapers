785211,TJQ,2013-05-08 17:49:00,7806,"I would really like to know how the MNR can have the stones put out a press release like this one...  when they are adamant about stocking not helping Lake Nipissing, EVEN if they do not have to fund it.  ------------- Across Ontario, millions of fish from provincial fish culture stations are being loaded onto trucks, boats and aircraft for stocking into public waters to help support a recreational fishery valued at more than $2.4 billion per year.Ontario operates nine fish culture stations in the province. Each year, these facilities produce and stock approximately 8.5 million fish into more than 1,200 lakes and rivers, including the Great Lakes.Fish stocking creates more angling opportunities, rehabilitates degraded fish populations and helps restore biodiversity. Fish are also indicators of environmental change and fish populations provide early warning signals about potential problems in the environment.Protecting and enhancing local biodiversity is part of the Ontario government’s plan to enhance quality of life for families and ensure a strong, green economy for future generations.QUOTE“Ontario fisheries are a significant resource contributing to Ontario's economy and recreational angling opportunities. We all have a role to play to ensure a healthy, diverse fishery for everyone to enjoy and to pass on to future generations.” — David Orazietti, Minister of Natural ResourcesQUICK FACTSOntario invests approximately $5.5 million a year (editors note... PEANUTS) in fish culture and stocking activities.Each year, about 1.3 million anglers spend an average of 16 days fishing in Ontario.The province manages 24 per cent of Canada's fresh water, including 40 per cent of the Great Lakes and countless rivers and streams.Species stocked include Atlantic salmon, aurora trout, brook trout, brown trout, splake, lake trout, lake whitefish, rainbow trout, walleye, muskellunge and Chinook salmon.There are approximately 250,000 inland lakes in Ontario.

785213,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-05-08 17:56:00,0,David O. is our local MPP.  He's good for nothing more than press releases and photo ops.  He tows the party line with the best of them.  Another useless minister of natural resources.
785220,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-08 18:14:00,8243,"TJ,  Do you have a link to that press release?  Thanks JD"
785221,fishindevil,2013-05-08 18:20:00,6254,so true TJ its all about lying to the public.....
785223,Harrison,2013-05-08 18:35:00,2202,"They forgot to mention the $250,000 for the wier being put in Duffins to display the success of the Atlantic stocking program.  At a $25 avg license fee, that is approx. 10,000 anglers in Ontario who bought this thing."
785246,Sinker,2013-05-08 19:43:00,8692,MNR could care less about our resources. I fear for my kids heritage when they get to be my age.  Nothing but a bunch of clowns.  S.

785277,Rod Caster,2013-05-08 21:27:00,5784,"It's not the ministry themselves, its the politicians running the show...what the heck do they really know about natural resources. The only thing our current Minister of NR is doing, is padding his resume by taking on this task. These politicians roll from position to position to make it look like they have a series of skills so they can clout their ""credibility"" to the next politician.  I feel bad for the people working in the MNR who actually care and have purpose. They are so hog tied that they can't even help our resource, which is their main goal, and ours as well.  The funny thing about stocking, is that they wouldn't have to do so much of it if they had more enforcement out there. Soooooo many poachers out there."
785281,spincast,2013-05-08 21:45:00,3279,"Bingo Chad. The current government has taken Orwell's 1984 vision of governmental communication and fine tuned it to such a degree ... that the main task of any ministry's communication department is to stop any information other than self promotional propaganda from being released, and our scientists are muzzled or fired for disseminating the results of their research if it does not promote the ""Vision"""

785287,chris_robinson,2013-05-08 22:13:00,14, This is incorrect.  The weir was funded by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.  Chris Robinson OFAH Atlantic Salmon Restoration Program Coordinator
785290,Rod Caster,2013-05-08 22:22:00,5784," The MNR, if you mean the Minister(s) and or the Deputy Ministers of NR. The Ministry itself has a lot of experienced, inteligent and useful people working for them. The Ministry is or maybe was, a very competent group of people, they are just given the wrong tasks."
785349,Sinker,2013-05-09 01:21:00,8692,"I understand its not the actual ministry who makes the decisions, and its all politics, but I still feel safe painting them all with one brush.  The whole ministry is corrupt, just like every other government agency in canada. Its all about the mighty dollar. They'll slit their own throats to make a buck or make themselves look good.  Makes my blood boil!  S."
785500,Harrison,2013-05-09 18:26:00,2202," Thanks for the clarification Chris, I don't recall hearing that at the presentation by the MNR.  Is the installation still scheduled for late summer this year inbetween Hwy 2 and Brock Rd?  Will there be a realease of sorts for the media?"
785572,chris_robinson,2013-05-09 23:51:00,14," The weir's in place now, but not fishing (i.e. it's in ""flow-through"" mode - it doesn't capture anything) currently until some flow happens in the river.  It went in after the rainbow run and will continue into the fall.  I'm not sure if MNR/TRCA are doing a release, there will be signs in place and they've consulted with the larger stakeholder groups in the area.  Chris OFAH Atlantic Salmon Program Coordinator"
785578,Sinker,2013-05-10 00:11:00,8692,"Is this weir in place to capture smolting atlantics? Are they going to be marked, or tagged in some way?  Where exactly is it? I assume downstream of the forks, but above hwy 2?  I might have to go check it out.  Is it anything like the trap that was in cobourg, or is this a permanent struucture?  Pics would be great if you have any....  S."
785600,Jon,2013-05-10 01:59:00,209,It will capture upstream migrating adults.  Jon
785609,craigdritchie,2013-05-10 02:22:00,1586, That's contingent on any adults actually showing up. Don't hold your breath.

785624,danc,2013-05-10 03:20:00,4677,"Personally, I don't like catching stocked fish, or the reason behind stocking in the first place. Fishing to me means getting out into the wilderness and enjoying what nature has to offer. Somehow, stocked fish don't fit into this equation, for me anyways. Fishing for stocked fish is like going to a pay per lb. trout farm, but on a bigger scale."

786002,capt_hooked,2013-05-12 14:00:00,212,"The MNR's budget is a very small portion of the Ontario Gov't's annual funds.. (like 3%?)  This 3% covers all natural resources (mining, forestry, fish and wildlife). Until the Ontario government understands that our Natural Resources are more important than casinos... we are in trouble...  The local MNR boys work hard .. but their hands are tied by lack of funds... (mostly)..  However it is still hard to understand why the North Bay office is so much opposed to walleye stocking (their attitude is natural reproduction is better than a ""put and take"" fishery).  Other MNR districts (Sudbury for one.. is all for stocking) and fully understand the benefits...  Although the North Bay office has no money to support walleye stocking .. they could support us by allowing us to expand our stocking program on Lake Nipissing..  We (the local population and camp operators) can come up with some very inventive ideas to raise the funds... no costs to the MNR... just let us stock some fish!  Vale (Inco) is raising walleye fingerlings underground and is excited about helping local areas increase their walleye stocks...  Remember that our yellow walleyes are all the result of a massive stocking effort by the MNR in the early 1920s... Before that we only had the smaller blue walleyes...  These would have been too small to be exploited by a commercial fishing industry...  The natives should be using box trap nets, instead of gill nets and thereby reducing the by-catch to zero..! Check out (internet) the Michigan MNR arrangements with the native population... (only trap nets allowed)... and they are doing great...  I applaud the MNR for deciding to be more open to the public through press releases and their hard efforts recently, (last summer with an advisory committee on Lake NIpissing walleye and currently another advisory committee dealing with a 20 year plan (including all fish species) for Lake Nipissing).  the cap't  p.s.f thanks T.J."
786215,capt_hooked,2013-05-13 11:39:00,212,"5 days until opening...!  my prediction: late spring.. cold water.. means.. good for big pike, chasing spawning minnows... walleyes will be slow... and much better one week later as water warms up...  But as soon as you make a prediction the fish... will mess with you...!     go Leafs...!!!!!"
