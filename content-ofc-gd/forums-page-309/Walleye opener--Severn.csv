786823,BillM,2013-05-15 22:50:00,17367,It's been open since last weekend... It's zone 16.
786855,SirCranksalot,2013-05-16 00:33:00,3291,"Thx, Bill. i was looking in the paper copy of the regs and could not find it, then went on the website and got lost among the maps."
786864,Angler management,2013-05-16 00:53:00,280,Its zone 17 in Campbelleford area...
786893,BillM,2013-05-16 02:06:00,17367, Severn starts at Couch and ends in Gbay.  No part of it is in Zone 17.
786894,SirCranksalot,2013-05-16 02:07:00,3291,He must mean the Trent
786896,BillM,2013-05-16 02:08:00,17367," Yeah, that's what I'm assuming."
786907,Angler management,2013-05-16 02:16:00,280,"Yep, my bad..."
786911,BillM,2013-05-16 02:23:00,17367,Anyone fish the Severn just down from Couch?  I never have (Well I haven't since I was a kid) I usually fish below Sparrow and above Gloucester.
786919,SirCranksalot,2013-05-16 02:38:00,3291,I hope to go to the section between sparrow and the falls on Fri. Anyone know of a good launching point?
