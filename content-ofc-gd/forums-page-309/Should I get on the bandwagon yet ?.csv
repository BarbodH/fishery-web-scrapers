786197,lew,2013-05-13 09:34:00,12766,"I haven't watched an NHL game for about 45 years and may be the only Canadian who never saw Gretzky play hockey, but I hear  the  Maple Leafs may actually win the cup this year.  Is it time for me to become a fan yet ??"
786198,crappieperchhunter,2013-05-13 09:53:00,2582,Might as well Lew. Pretty much everyone I work with has jumped on.  I'm happy for the real hardcore true blue leaf fans but the band wagon jumpers just really annoy me.
786199,lew,2013-05-13 10:03:00,12766," OK then Steve, I won't bother hopping aboard  I spose missing one more year won't hurt me"
786200,Rich,2013-05-13 10:12:00,3927,"Only in today's world, when new fans are introduced, they are chastized by older fans as ""bandwagon jumpers""  Your opinion on a hockey team is completely worthless, whether you've liked them 50 years, or five minutes, so get over it.  Hockey really annoys me."
786203,lew,2013-05-13 10:36:00,12766,"Umm, my post was just a joke Rich, sorry if it spoiled your day.  You can lock this one up now Roy....sheesh."
786207,Roy,2013-05-13 11:04:00,13728,"By definition, a fan is a bandwagon jumper. It makes no difference. I'm still on the 6 team schedule here Lew."
786208,lew,2013-05-13 11:07:00,12766," Ah yes, the good ole days, I remember them well"
786218,BITEME,2013-05-13 12:07:00,1968,"Lew, Roy im with you guys Im kind of still back at 6 I did watch a good part of last night though and that was some really good hockey and I have to say before i was evere a leafs fan when i was a kid I was a Flyers fan Go Bernie!  Peter"
786220,BillM,2013-05-13 12:12:00,17367,"Lew, it's way too early to be talking about the Leafs and the cup, lol!"
786223,vance,2013-05-13 12:24:00,719,Everyone knows the joke that hell will freeze over when the leafs win the cup.BUT with downward spiral of the temperature is this an omen????  vance
786224,Harrison,2013-05-13 12:29:00,2202,"I have a couple buddies who I ""think"" were kidding when they said they were putting an X on their parade route spot today.  Game 7 in Boston, that will be a battle! Should be an awesome game tonight."
786226,Mike Pike,2013-05-13 12:36:00,1332,The key is to never jump off Lew.  lol
786246,Rod Caster,2013-05-13 14:05:00,5784,"I've jumped on, but like Rich said, allegience to hockey teams is essentially meaningless. Leafs are entertaining me the most so I want them to continue playing. Now, IF the jets were playing that would completely change my bandwagon jumping habits! As much as I want leafs to win, I'd like to see Pens and Hawks in finals!"

786273,ketchenany,2013-05-13 16:17:00,3229,"Holi crap Lew, I'm in the same boat as you, too late to become a fan!"
786276,jedimaster,2013-05-13 16:24:00,3472,Jump on boys. Plenty of room for any non sens fan. Biggest game in 9 years. If you are gonna watch this is the one to start with.
786509,Beans,2013-05-14 14:31:00,3339,OOPS...too late Lew !!!
786512,Chance,2013-05-14 14:38:00,420,"Thats okay Lew ,it will be rollin back into town in a few months !"
786516,mr blizzard,2013-05-14 14:49:00,1589,X2
786523,lew,2013-05-14 15:13:00,12766,"I actually watched the 3rd period and for a fleeting moment I was quite impressed with how well the Leaf's were doing, kinda like the Leafs way back in the day.  But the fleeting moment was just that....  Oh well, if they make the playoffs again next year, I may just hop on that wagon one more time just for old times sake."
786590,outllaw,2013-05-14 22:00:00,1232,the greens are dry FORE
786591,SirCranksalot,2013-05-14 22:02:00,3291,"Spring has sprung, the grass is green, the Leafs are out!!"
786596,Chance,2013-05-14 22:22:00,420,Thats all part of their master plan. Lull you into a false sense of security for 40 + years and then WHAM they win the cup !
786599,SirCranksalot,2013-05-14 22:29:00,3291,"Legend has that they won the cup way back in the olden days, or at least that's what me pappy told me and he didn't lie............or at least not that much."
786607,FloatnFly,2013-05-14 22:56:00,1640,"before i die, im going to ask the leafs to be my pall bearer, just so they can let me down one last time"
