I always seem to need small pieces (up to 12""x12"" but larger Ok) of rubber sheet up to 1/4"" thick for gaskets, mountings, clamping, etc.  Can someone point me in the right direction?  Thanks in advance,  Mark"

786577,Rattletrap2,2013-05-14 20:13:00,1652,I always bought my sheet gasket material from The Gasketman Inc.  in Brampton. Bruce Hope (905) 792-2413 Bruce has pretty much any size and thickness you could want. He will either sell you the material or cut the gaskets for you.
