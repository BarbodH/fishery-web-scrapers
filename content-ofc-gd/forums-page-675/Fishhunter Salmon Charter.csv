472820,irishfield,2010-06-05 23:07:00,26272,Sorry Shayne.. just saw this now!.. we left at 2 on Friday for Port Hope.
471456,irishfield,2010-06-01 00:21:00,26272,For what Chris... offering a spot in SOMEONE ELSES boat!!
471462,Spiel,2010-06-01 00:30:00,9065,"  Ya, that's it.   "
471774,irishfield,2010-06-02 01:57:00,26272,"Okay Terry... I almost thought that we'd run out of friends... but we're full ! Thanks for playing lads.  If anyone wants to get out on the big O.. Lloyd has a spot for 4 OFC'rs on Sunday the 6th still up for grabs, just to keep him active and on fish for future paying charters. Check the announcement section for more information.."
471787,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-02 02:37:00,2690,"LOL...spam, nothing...can't believe four people haven't snapped this up already.  Anybody wanting to get out for a fun day of fishing with a knowledgable guy for an extremely reasonable price, don't hesitate.  I already said if it wasn't for aching to get out with my own boat for musky opener, I'd be there."
471813,Terry,2010-06-02 09:14:00,14456,alright let the fun begin............
471825,fishhunter,2010-06-02 10:57:00,604,well I'm sure it will be fun lol never dull when we hook up!!! Well first times in all the time I have been posting hook ups that I did not get a hit for a day. June 6th is still open for OFC (4) people
472117,fishnsled,2010-06-03 03:38:00,3520,Looking forward to Saturday Lloyd.  I can't believe that someone hasn't jumped on the Sunday Charter yet.  You'll be amazed at what you can learn in a few short hours.
472144,Headhunter,2010-06-03 12:58:00,5703,GRAVOL! HH
472171,bigbuck,2010-06-03 14:02:00,2449,"You know, this really is a Community. It never fails to amaze me how people that are virtually strangers help each other out on this site. Yeah there are a few bad apples who stir up trouble but they are flashes in the pan. Kudos to the admins who keep this site up and running. Fishunter graciously offers his boat and services for gas money to OFC'rs this weekend and nobody has really thanked him for that. Well, I thank you even though I can't make it and would love to go. Wayne, you are another one around here who does a lot for us. If you ever want to fish the Honey Harbour area, let me know, my boat is in the water till Halloween."
472193,fishnsled,2010-06-03 14:45:00,3520, And my sea bands.
472220,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-03 15:57:00,2690,Agreed and well said!!!

472224,Spiel,2010-06-03 16:12:00,9065, Looks like a bumpy ride......  .SATURDAY...SOUTHWEST WINDS 15 TO 25 KNOTS BECOMING NORTH ANDDIMINISHING TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS. SHOWERS LIKELY WITH A CHANCE OFTHUNDERSTORMS. WAVES 2 TO 4 FEET SUBSIDING TO 1 TO 3 FEET.  
472241,fishnsled,2010-06-03 16:55:00,3520, Could be a bit of a challenge standing up with a bum foot.  Might have to just drive the boat and Lloyd fight the fish.
472242,irishfield,2010-06-03 17:01:00,26272,.....a 3 hour tour.... a 3 hour tour...  ..the weather started getting rough.. and anyone that pukes will get tossed !
472289,Headhunter,2010-06-03 19:35:00,5703,"I sure that if you just follow the spent lemon wedges floating behind the boat, you should have no problem find your way back to port! HH"
472301,fishnsled,2010-06-03 20:27:00,3520," It will just be a matter of which port the lemon wedges get blown towards.  Could be Quinte or State side, better bring my passport.  lol!"
472303,Terry,2010-06-03 20:36:00,14456,"I just wanted to have a few laughs and catch a fish but this is getting out of control....LOL  and MY passport is way of of date........you will have to smuggle me state side   god........ I'm a"" boat people"""
472404,Bly,2010-06-04 01:18:00,1556,Thanks for all the chuckles guys and I hope you have a great time!
472419,AzuluSpookd,2010-06-04 02:00:00,348,"For someone who claims to be working so hard for the past 2.5 months non-stop, you sure spend alot of time on the computer...   I'm just sayin' is all......  lol"
472420,irishfield,2010-06-04 02:04:00,26272,If it isn't the great white hunter... had to bring in some pros to take 4 big toms out of here last week!!
472486,Headhunter,2010-06-04 12:48:00,5703,"Well guys, tomorrow's the day and in all honesty, I'd love to be out there with yah, watchin Terry's face when that flash of silver rips by the boat, drag all scream'en and stuff. Those sheepies can put up quite a fight! BBBBBBBAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Have a blast, like you need me to tell you that and Will, make sure you wear that ""slimming"" rain suit, I'm guessing their will be pics and a report! Lloyd... your a saint for taking that crew out on your boat! HH"
472510,fishnsled,2010-06-04 14:18:00,3520, The rainsuit with the pin strips is more slimming isn't it.    Too bad you can't make it Joe but we'll bring you back a sheepy if you like.
472512,AzuluSpookd,2010-06-04 14:20:00,348,Ouch! That hurt  Don't forget though...I tagged out in a week... 
472640,Sinker,2010-06-04 23:29:00,8692,"What time do you guys get back in?? You's going for a beer or something afterwards?? I'm close by, we should hook up when your done. I work till 4:30pm.   S."
471091,irishfield,2010-05-30 21:31:00,26272,"Terry??? Dano??? Roy???  ??? you in????  I'm absolutely fed up here and haven't taken a day off since Terry and I went ice fishing March 6th, with Paul and Joey... and need a break from these amphib float installs...... I need to go fishing!! You in??  Wayne"
471098,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-30 23:18:00,2690,"Enjoy guys, if you make it!!!  I already sent Lloyd a PM saying if I hadn't already set up a weekend of walleye and musky in the Kawarthas for my birthday Sunday...I'd be all over it!!!!!!!"
471112,Terry,2010-05-30 23:59:00,14456,you bet I am in......
471114,misfish,2010-05-31 00:04:00,29133,"I have to shuttle garage sale crap,but thanks for asking."

471300,Terry,2010-05-31 15:26:00,14456,damn..not them lemon drops again......  LOL
471311,Headhunter,2010-05-31 16:05:00,5703,"As the official convener of all thing lemony, I will sanction such a GTG, as long as the appropriate salutations are fully adhered to. (Blah Blah Blah... I sanction your lemons!) HH"
471323,Spiel,2010-05-31 16:33:00,9065," As a new recruit to the lemon drop brigade all I can say is......Thanks Joe, did I have a good time?   "
471325,irishfield,2010-05-31 16:39:00,26272,That mean you're coming Joe... we can pick you up on the way thru!!! .. Spiel??  Terry and I are in for sure. Dano and Roy are out..  There are still two spots open for Saturday at this point... 5AM Saturday departure from the Mill St docks in Port Hope..
471326,Spiel,2010-05-31 16:41:00,9065,"I would love to Wayne but it's not possible, too much on my plate and I can't risk it being choppy water."
471356,Headhunter,2010-05-31 17:57:00,5703,"Wayne, nothing would make me happier then chumming the water behind Lloyd's boat with residual lemons, but unfortunately, with a wife who is a school principle, the month of June tends to be a complete wash-out for me. Darn near every weekend has some kinda year end thing etc, etc... 5:00 am departure!!!!!!!! That's even earlier then normal Lloyd time! Maybe some time in July? HH Speil, through the bright red slits I call eyes, you seemed to be having a good time... just remember, ""it's a fun game, if you play it quick!"" And it's way better to have two, then one!"
471361,fishnsled,2010-05-31 18:28:00,3520," LMAO!!! :clapping:   Musky opener or salmon fishing......decisions, decisions."
471411,Terry,2010-05-31 21:51:00,14456,whoever comes..I prefer there be no chumming off the back of the boat all day I guess it depends which way the wind is blowing
471419,fishhunter,2010-05-31 22:20:00,604,so Wayne i take it you and terry are in and still looking for 2 more for the sat. Just So people know this is not a charter. Its for 4 OFC guys or gals to enjoy a day on the water and split the operating costs. Sunday is still open too for 4 people
471420,fishhunter,2010-05-31 22:20:00,604,Easy choice Salmon fishing with great guys.
471424,misfish,2010-05-31 22:38:00,29133," Well, some of us blue collar workers, have to work 5 days a week.Drinking free beer does sound fine to me.LOL  You all have a fun and safe trip."
471443,irishfield,2010-05-31 23:48:00,26272,Well Brian.. I've worked 7 days a week for over 2.5 months now without a day off.. until Friday that is! Just finished another 11 hour day in a 100+ degree hangar..  No way I'm driving on Saturday am to make it there for 5 !  Will... are you in???
471447,misfish,2010-06-01 00:09:00,29133,You call playing with areoplanes work? LOL
471448,fishnsled,2010-06-01 00:11:00,3520, I'm waiting to hear back on a day of muskie fishing.  It was promised a couple of months ago for the opening weekend.  If it doesn't happen I'm in.  Can you hold a spot for a day or so and I'll let you know as soon as I know.  Thanks.
471451,irishfield,2010-06-01 00:15:00,26272,Sure Will.. one spot tentatively yours until noon Wednesday.. that work?
