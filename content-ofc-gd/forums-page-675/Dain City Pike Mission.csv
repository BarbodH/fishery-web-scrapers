So we hit up the other side and went searching for some Dain City pike.  Most of the day was spent trolling both banks up and down. Most of our fish were caught on the walleye harnesses made by Rob. We were putting minnows on the hooks and trolling behind the boat with some splitshot.  I landed a rock bass, catfish, and there were a couple oos smallies.  But after some presistance I got what we were out for :    Was a great day and met a cool dude. Look forward to some more fishing missions soon!  "
