WHAT A GORGEOUS MORNING!                                  RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC WAS EVERYWHERE  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""            EVEN CAUGHT A FISH!  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""       Not soon after i got back up to the house my boy was up and in a much better mood, i was also in a great mood to see him so obviously delighted and interested in his fishing rod.......  THATS MY BOY!  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""                                  After getting all my chores done, mum and baby decided they were gonna nap together....i decided to stay awake and hit the lake for 2 hours....came up with a neat little challenge for myself/ catch Bass, crappie, Pike and walleye in that order, failing the challenge should i catch any of those fish out of sequence, so i headed down the lawn and took off   THE LIMEY CHALLENGE!  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""                   Successful in my challenge i was given a hero's (cough) welcome when i arrived back at shore triumphant.                 My boy and wife joined me in the boat while i replayed the highlights of my marvelous victory...lol.....but i donâ€™t think they were listening and my boy certainly seemed more interested in the minnow bucket.....   <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""    Spent the rest of the afternoon with the family then headed out at 8pm for an hour, the bite was terrible...not one fish....but some great rainbows with all the storms today, and a nice sunset to round off a really nice Monday of family and fishing.
