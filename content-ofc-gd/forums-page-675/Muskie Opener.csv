Didn't even have any follows today. Didn't start fishing till 2:30pm, so I really shouldn't complain. Thank god the wifey was along - I forgot my OFC sign, had to write it on the boat seat with a combination of her lipstick and mascara LMAO!!!  35"" added for Team One... to be upgraded shortly...   "
472893,BillM,2010-06-06 04:30:00,17367,Awesome fish man!!  I saw a few guys out today tossing big blades but didn't see any fish landed.  The lake I was fishing has some monsters but they are few and far between.

Johnny - that big girl we saw the other day is still out there waiting for you, get that rattly little silver lure out and bring her in!"
