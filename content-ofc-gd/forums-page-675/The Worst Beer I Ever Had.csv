Green garbage can, add the cans of malt sent to them from u.k., sugar,yeast and sugar, let it forment till friday and then drink it right out of the can. Warm and cloudy with chunks, and the most foul smell. One sip for me was good. But these two guys would drink 3/4 of the can in one evening. They loved it. Guess it reminded them of home. Good lads too."
