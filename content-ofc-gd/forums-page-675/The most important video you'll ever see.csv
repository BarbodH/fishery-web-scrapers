472349,Jigger,2010-06-03 22:27:00,1237,"After reading some comments about the abundance of oil in the Dalton thread, I was going to post this, but didn't want to derail what was going on there.  This is a lecture, so don't expect too much fanfare. Here is part 1 of 8 and is a little time intensive for the entire set. But for those that are interested, have a peek. It may change your ideas about abundance and the way we are led to believe that growth and consumption rates can continue forever. Parts 2-8 can be found in the same place.  "
472355,GBW,2010-06-03 22:53:00,8460,Thanks for the info J.  very interesting (one seen part 1 so far).
472360,Roy,2010-06-03 23:07:00,13728,What's wrong with the link Jigger?
472363,Terry,2010-06-03 23:10:00,14456,
472364,Roy,2010-06-03 23:11:00,13728, Thanks Terry.
472371,Jigger,2010-06-03 23:36:00,1237,"Thanks Terry, don't know what I did there  EDIT: fixed. Was the old double http// trick..."
472374,GBW,2010-06-03 23:43:00,8460,"When the link didn't work I went to youtube and looked for ""The most important video you'll ever see"" and found all of them"
472465,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-04 10:46:00,1183,Jigger....thank you.

472488,skeeter,2010-06-04 12:52:00,1907,"you are absolutely right jewelbee!  but that was hilarious, when are you posting another link like that one????? "
472493,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-04 13:13:00,0,I watched a good 5 minutes and I have no idea why this is the most important video I'll ever see....Can someone fill me in on what is so special about this?
472537,Tybo,2010-06-04 16:17:00,1373,What It means is in 10 years we will consume double the amount of energy that we use right now. In 20 years we will consume 8 times. In 30 years we will consume 64 times.
472577,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-04 18:40:00,0," Oh I see....Considering that there are too many variables like alternate energies, technological breakthroughs, lifestyles, plagues, wars, ect...It would be difficult to come up with accurate figures of consumption in the distant future."
472666,Fisherman,2010-06-05 01:44:00,7201,"Not ragging on you, but really take a look at the videos again without any background distraction.  The variables you speak of are also subject to the same increases, so not a lot gained."
472682,Jewelbee,2010-06-05 02:32:00,422,Not too soon I hope!
472700,Cudz,2010-06-05 03:51:00,2652,Yeah and when reserves get low Saudi will all of a sudden mysteriously find more oil fields.
