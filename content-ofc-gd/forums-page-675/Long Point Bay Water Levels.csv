As soon as I hit Sandboy Marina I could see how high it got. It's almost to the top of the seawalls   . Am I ever glad I don't leave the ropes tight to the dock. There were a lot of people's boats leaning to one side because they were tight. I went to a bunch of them and loosened the ropes, hope they don't mind.  This a a pic from LAST WEEK, you can see the level on the far side.    and today          We went out on the bay but it was too rough for Jacob so we went in a loaded the boat up.  Hopefully you guys on Nipissing got some of this."
