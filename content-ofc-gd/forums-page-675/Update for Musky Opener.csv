471193,Handlebarz,2010-05-31 03:06:00,3790,"Here are the first batch of HandleBarZ Flashabou musky bucktails. I have been playing around for a couple years now and like to tie some lures I love tying bucktails and had bought some of the flashabou a couple seasons ago but was not impressed with it as it would twist a lot but with the Newer Magnum Flashabou I was more then happy with the results from tying this stuff just tying with it you know it feels strong enough to put in front of the big girls and the test market over the last few season has been great with all the rage for bigger baits and flashabou like double cowgirls and other double 10 and 13 blades.  Well here is my take on them most have a size 8 colorado or indiana blade there is one 13 and one mag willow 5 that is 7"" other then that we have alot of luck with smaller blades here on Lake St.Clair.

471195,irishfield,2010-05-31 03:08:00,26272,Nice Christmas tree ornaments Mike !!
471219,lew,2010-05-31 08:26:00,12766,"They look good Mike, very nice work !!"
471235,canadadude,2010-05-31 11:22:00,769,"They look nice, however when I use flash I find alittle goes along way. I prefer to use bucktail and only use a few strands of flash to enhance the bait.I'm not a big fan of to much flash unless I'm tying Twinkle flies for Salmon fish'in  Anyway I'd be interested to see how they work,you may be on to somthing. They gotta cost a bit using that much flash"
471264,Handlebarz,2010-05-31 13:06:00,3790,Thanks guys Wayne I will not show the wife your post she can just wait until December 16th to see where they will go in the off season right now she just wants her clock back  Canada Dude this is nothing new on the market just something fun for me to do at the house they do cost a fair bit but still alot cheaper then buying them in a store and ya have some fun at the same time. I was using the normal Flashabou but it is just not good enough and I have cut up alot of baits I made as they would tangle and twist into the blades.  
471301,mepps,2010-05-31 15:31:00,1301,Great work!
471382,SlowPoke,2010-05-31 19:55:00,2984,"Looking good Mike, I can't wait to see them up close!"
471485,Ron,2010-06-01 01:59:00,1683,"Awesome Mike!  I'll take the next 4 bud, thanks! lol  PS: Who is this MikeP guy EH? (nice avatar btw) ha haha  Cheers, Ron..."
472850,SlowPoke,2010-06-06 00:47:00,2984," Okay, I had a chance to see them up close. Very nice! Here's a chance to see them in action...  HandleBarZ ""Confusion""   They glory shot   And the payoff   Nice debut for a bait, Mike! First time in the water and they were enough to win the Muskies Canada Opener with a thick 45""er."
472853,Syn,2010-06-06 00:55:00,519,Brilliant Mike!!! Congrats on the win Slowpoke!
472856,irishfield,2010-06-06 01:03:00,26272,When does the new factory outlet open Mike???  Great stuff Brian!!!!!
472857,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-06 01:05:00,0,Very nice. The only thing better than making your own lures is when you actually catch fish on them!!!Makes the catch all the more sweeter.
472906,Handlebarz,2010-06-06 10:31:00,3790,Thanks for the props Brian and sorry I could not give you the first one of that color it would not be fair to have it sit on a shelf beside your trophy  SYN thank you  Wayne I would love to do nothing more then make lures that would be almost a dream job next to owning a camp and make lures. I will sell some and not have the inflated prices so that regular fishermen/women can afford them. Will figure that out soon enough.  Johhny You are right it sure was a great feeling to have that one go off it was not out to long either we (well I) lost two more on it after Brian got that one.  When the end of the day was here this is how it totaled Brian 1 Mike 1 Musky 5  What a great way to start the season off.
472920,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-06 11:50:00,1362,"The baits look good Mike!!  ......Congrats Brian, that's a nice way to start the season off!!!  13 more days and it opens up here in Zone 12..."
472923,Rich Clemens,2010-06-06 11:56:00,3131,Great looking baits there Mike and the proof that you have a design that can catch fish.  COngrats on your win Brian.  Just two more weeks and I'll take my turn.
472972,Ron,2010-06-06 13:57:00,1683,"NICE!  Good to see Dupois (sp) with a big ol smile on his face too. Way to go Brian, now you will have to listen to that MP guy taking credit for the rest of the season! ha ha ha.... just razzin Mike, good to see your spinners working out to a great start of the season bud.  Cheers, Ron..."
472986,Handlebarz,2010-06-06 14:20:00,3790,I here ya on that side Ron but on the down fall he will just take out his trophy and win that round of arguing kinda like some time I remember a couple years ago  
472993,Terry,2010-06-06 14:43:00,14456,nice going  really nice looking lures
473003,SlowPoke,2010-06-06 15:01:00,2984," That's okay Ron, I'm just honoured to be part of the HandleBarZ Pro Staff and looking forward to getting the tournament shirts and boat wrap.  Maybe Nissan will sponser me too."
