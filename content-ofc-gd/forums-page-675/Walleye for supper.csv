472340,Blue Lk,2010-06-03 21:43:00,337,"GF & I went to a small lake today where I keep a 12ft stashed,We allways catch lots of these little pan sized fish,sometimes 1 or 2 bigger but allways get more than enough for a fish fry.In the 3 or 4 yrs I have been going to this lake we have only shared the lake about 3 times.It takes me about 1/2 hour from home,some hwy some old logging road.The lake is small so I use my electric,easy to get to the boat with my quad.     GF shot this pic of a nesting Loon "
