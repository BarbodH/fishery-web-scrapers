If it's NOT gummed up then nothing until the end of the year (last time out). Then you should add Sta-Bill fuel stabilizer and make sure you run it through the carbs and then run the carbs dry...And then foam the cylinders, change the lower unit oil and have a beer.  http://store.tackleandrods.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=FLT&Product_Code=SBFS&Category_Code=MOTOR  Bob"
