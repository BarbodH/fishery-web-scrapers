472578,Raf,2010-06-04 18:44:00,3495,"I am not sure what you are asking Johnny.  A turbine on an automobile, if it is exhaust driven is called a turbocharger.  a supercharger if it is belt driven.  They both do the same thing, cram (compress) more air into the combustion chamber and when mixed with more fuel, they produce more power.  So yes, they are increasing the amount of air (compared to a naturally aspirated car engine) by pressurizing it.   However, air without fuel is just air and if you add air you also need to add fuel.  Both also need to fuel to run (exhaust in the case of a turbo, the crank spinning in the case of a SC)"

472656,John Bacon,2010-06-05 00:55:00,3277, The power comes from the exhaust being pushed out the back of the engine.  The jet fuel requires oxygen to burn.  The air intake at the front of the engine is serves to provide air (which contains oxygen) for the combustion process.  If the air itself produced the power then air planes would require fuel to operate.
472676,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-05 02:22:00,0," I'm not suggesting that the car just run on air. Just that it utilizes(improves energy consumption using) the power of the wind. When I put my arm outside the window on the highway, I feel the power the wind is generating.The primary energy source would be fuel or electricity. The energy made by the air would be a secondary source. Recharging a battery or whatnot."
472687,John Bacon,2010-06-05 02:40:00,3277," As previously pointed out by Jer, the additional wind resistance caused by generating electricity from the wind would cause your car to burn more fuel.  The additional energy required to power the car would exceed the amount of energy that was produced by the wind; it's called the law of conservation of energy.  Mount wind generators on a car would actually waste energy; not save it."

Nuclear energy was unpopular in the past because of leaks, nuclear waste, and of course Chernobyl. But with todays technology these fears are minimal, and they have discovered ways to reuse most(if not all) of the waste produced by nuclear plants.  So ya, we may consider making some more nuke plants. Not to mention an oil refinery. We have an abundance of oil, but we pay more for our OWN oil then Americans? Why? A number of bogus reasons, but one transparent one? We have to ship it to the states to refine it and then they ship it back with the added cost of course. Lets start making jobs in Canada!

When the first car was invented by FORD, it was an electric car where you cranked the engine charged it up and let it go, but the oil companies insisted he make it run on gas since it was very cheap and abundant at the time. Its still abundant but apparently not so cheap anymore, with hordes of bogus excuses for the increase.  Then you have natural gas that has shot up threw the roof even though we have a gigantic supply of it.  Its all robbery.  As far as electric cars? You could even put wind turbines on the front/sides(like planes) that would give you added power/electricity. It could recharge your electric battery while you are running on the battery or gas tank.  There are so many ways to produce cheap energy but the rich want to hold us by the balls."

Very little, and the amount of pollution it would emit is next to nothing. How can you compare wind farm emissions to the burning of fossil fuels is beyond me.  I thought of the same idea, but with horses on the belt.lol I'm sure there are many ways to produce cheap electricity but you wont hear it from the energy corps.

472558,POLLIWOGG,2010-06-04 17:43:00,835,"Solar panels produce very little power compared to the cost of putting them into production financially and environmentally and the idea that if we build a subsidized market for them they will build a better solar panel is questionable when you think about the market for solar panels has been satellites and space stations. If those guys can't make a better panel who can?  $80,000 puts up a 10k solar panel that at pre green energy policy unsubsidized prices would hardly pay for itself over its life expectancy let alone make a profit.  On. doesn't use oil to make electricity so there is no comparing wind farm to fossil fuel. We may have to built gas fired plants to help regulate the wind farms though like they did in Europe. Then they figured if we got to build gas plants why bother with wind generation and stopped using them.  The best way that wind generation will replace oil is with the electric car but by driving up the price of electricity it guarantees that will never happen.  Got the notice in the paper today... 138 turbines right on top of 6,550 hectares of the best smallmouth  fishing in On.

The list is long and the problem is that there is no system in Canada to make these guys accountable.  You can vote for any party you want and they will promise you what ever they think you want to hear but as soon as they get into power, they give themselves huge raises and lavish pensions while the rest of us work our asses off and get taxed to death. Don't pay your taxes, go directly to jail.  Right now, more than 50% of everything you earn goes to our government who spend it as they see fit (a good portion of it on themselves) and he who works hardest sometimes holding down two jobs just so he can feed his family and because his income goes up so does his tax rate while the guy that doesn't bother getting the second job and sits on his butt earns less so he pays a lower tax rate. Doesn't sound like a fair system to me!  So here is the plan: I'll run for PM if you'll all contribute to my campaign. If I get elected I'll form a board of governers made up of average working people. I will reduce my pay to $50,000.00/year and pay each of the members of the board $50,000.00 salary and Reasonable Expenses. The board will vote on any majour expenditures and majourity will rule!  Non esential expenses will be cut until the deficite is paid off unless there is good investment potential.  Any public servent making more that $250,000.00 a year will be fired and replaced by someone willing to do the job for $50,000.00 a year and then they will also have a board of directors to answer to; you got it, also making $50,000.00 a year. Raises other than the cost of living will be based on performance, do a good job, show a profit, there will be profit sharing FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES!  Pensions will be adjusted based on the years a person has lived in and contributed to Canada. None of this ""come live here 3 years and get a pension even if you haven't contributed anything"".  New immigrantes will be required to show merrit in coming to this country and a proficiency in our language and laws. They will be able to offer a skill or a trade or fill some other role that is of value to this country.  In short, I would run this country like a business (and I have run a few that all made a profit).  The billions of dollars that our casinos and OLG rake in every year would be diverted to paying down the debt and once the debt is paid off a budget would be established that is realistic and taxes would be lowered so that the net worth of every Canadian would go up.  Seniors would all be entitled to quality retirement homes that are staffed properly and would have very strict guide lines as to the care of the residents. There would be no more ""wards"" every one would be entitled to their own private apartment and what ever care they would need so they could live out their last years in dignity and with respect.  Now I realize that this would all cost money but look at all the jobs it would create, besides we spend on average $26,000.00 a year on prisoners why can't we do it for our seniors.  Our justice system would over go some significant changes. It would be simplified, one crime, one time, do it twice, do double the time...... and Sheriff Joe Arpaio would be hired to impliment a similar system here to what he has done for Arizona. the money we'd save would pay for all the retirement homes!

Once they get fed into the political machine they apparently lose pretty much whatever ethics and free will they may have possessed before. Unfortunately there's been so much damage done that even if a good politician (has that become an oxymoron now?) did join the fray he'd have no credibility - guilt by association.  I once suggested to some friends with experience that I was interested in getting into simple municipal politics. Their response was a resounding ""ARE YOU FREAKIN'NUTS?"". They filled me in on the joys of even that level of politics (it seems those guys are just in training for the big leagues but not as crafty as the big timers).  At the risk of sounding alarmist politics at pretty much all levels seems to have sunk to the level of the lowest common denominator, and there are some pretty low denominators in the game. Dunno what the solution is though. A lot of folks seem to have come to the conclusion that it's easier to just bend over and let 'em have their way. It's gonna happen whether you fight or not.

You can see them taking their time chatting with co-workers while your waiting in line. And then you ask them a question and they get all annoyed.

Oliphant finds Mulroney-Schreiber dealings 'inappropriate'???  Thanks to who? Of course the Harper government whose election platform was that the liberals were protecting their people. Talk about calling the kettle black!  Thanks to terms of reference crafted by the Conservative government, Oliphant was precluded from making any findings of criminal or civil liability. He was specifically barred from revisiting allegations that Mulroney and Schreiber were involved in a kickback scheme at the time of Air Canada's $1.8-billion Airbus purchase in 1988.  Nor was he allowed to revisit the $2.1-million libel settlement Mulroney won from the federal government in 1997 as a result of the RCMP's Airbus investigation â all the while insisting he barely knew Schreiber.    In other words they wasted 16 million and let him off the 2.1 million he won wrongfully.  And the inquiry learned that Fred Doucet, a Mulroney insider turned lobbyist, had written to Schreiber about the Airbus sale on the same day that Schreiber handed the ex-prime minister his first cash payment.  Oliphant was not given a mandate to connect the dots, and he did not.  This entire trial was a joke!"

We've had them at Pickering and Darlington for over 30 years. Get the plants up and running and build more. I'm sure there are mines up north in the boondocks that could be used to store the waste. Big government equals big waste and we really need to realize that. I can go on and on until your ears bleed. I think the future for energy production lies elsewhere however but that is what I think and I'll keep it to myself."

Don't worry the Fiberals will get back in again, they've lied to the Ontario pubic every election and still Ontarians seem to love this crap.It's actually gotten quite comical how Mc guinty keeps getting reelected we're all just a bunch of sheep in this province and Mc guinty shears us on a regualar basis"

471221,Chris,2010-05-31 09:41:00,405,"Got this email this morning....  Dalton McGuinty   Here is what our premier has done for Ontario in the past seven years!!!!!!  By the way, his was a no tax increase election campaign.   He increased all the licensing fees from your car to your boat including fishing and hunting.  He introduced the health care premium (not called a tax) some couples pay as much as $1,500.00 a year.  He doubled the price of most lottery tickets. (Not called a tax).  He has put a ECO tax on many containers such as paint cans and window washer fluid most people still donât realize it is on your bill, he kept that one real quiet  He has put a disposal tax on all electronics.  He has put the disposal tax back on tires  Now donât forget that all except the health care premium are subject to the GST and PST (taxes on taxes.)  And now he has pasted the HST the largest tax on the province ever, the only other tax in Ontario that ever came close to this in the past was the health care premium.  He pasted this bill even though 76% of the people in Ontario were against it.  This HST will provide the Province with an additional THREE BILLION dollars a year.  And now we will have our S.M.A.R.T. meters that we will have to pay rent on and do our laundry in the middle of the night and we are going to pay big time for air conditioning from now on because when we need it the most that will be prime time. As if it costs any more to produce hydro at two in the afternoon or ten at night another tax grab.  Let us not forget the E health scandal with one point two billion dollars wasted and paid out to friends and relatives.  What was Mr. McGuintyâs answer to this (well if the people of Ontario donât like it they can show it in the next election.) Nice attitude. This was after he fired the CEO and gave her a severance package of three hundred thousand dollars not bad for only having the job for seven months.  Then the windmill power plant he awards the contract to KOREA seven BILLION DOLLARS. One would think that there was some place in Canada or North America that could have built these.  He closed the emergency rooms in Port Colburne and Fort Erie because there is not enough money and there has been two deaths since because by the time they got to St.Catharines it was to late.  But awards a hospital in Toronto three million dollars in the riding where there just happens to be a by- election to replace George Smitherman  He has taken the richest most prosperous province in Canada to one of the poorest and has created a deficit of TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS and he still has a year and a half to go.  And donât forget his nice little salary increase of $40,000.00 a year, millions of people in the province donât earn half that.  All the MPPâS got 14% increase  Now that they all got nice increases he comes out with a new budget and freezes all provincial employees wages for two years.  He has increased the hydro by 10% in April of 2010.  He has increased the tax on liquor and wine by 10% in May of 2010  But mister no tax McGuinty will retire with his nice comfortable pension and all his paid benefits.  I hope this gets passed around the province of Ontario and everybody remember the way we got screwed by mister McGinty and the liberal party not one liberal MPP had enough guts to vote against any of the above."
471231,Big Cliff,2010-05-31 11:01:00,6899,It doesn't seem to matter who gets elected and it won't until there is some form of accountability. Broken promisses and lies are just accepted and apart from waiting until the next election and voting for the person that tells us the biggest and best lies there isn't anything we can do about it.
471238,limeyangler,2010-05-31 11:45:00,5204,"i agree with Cliff to a degree, it does not matter who is in office...its all the same. I vote because of some misguided feeling that it makes a difference and i want to feel like i have some control left....reality is i fear that we dont.  I just watched the British election, its all a sham. The Conservative guy won kinda...its a coalition with the Lib Dems. This is meant to be a historical ....nay...momemtous, landmark, watershed of an occassion in Britain.......Bull.......same old same old.

471268,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 13:23:00,0,"  Exactly. When these politicians make promises and then they don't come through? They should be thrown out of office!  Bigugli is right. Politicians cater to their campaign donors. Not to the people. Thanks to free trade, US corporations now run Canada like they do in America. They are the big money behind the politicians.  As far as McGuinty? ALL politicians are crooked. Liberal doesn't stand for liberal anymore and conservative doesn't stand for conservative. They are just two different parties with the same goals. To take away tax payers/consumers dollars and divert them to the rich.  The Liberals gained a lot of votes bringing in Immigrants from Europe and held on to the power for a while. Now the conservatives followed suit, immigrating tons of Chinese, Indian and Pakistanis(brought in for cheap labor to cater to free trade with the USA). The Chinese have now passed the French and is now the second most common spoken language in Canada(after English of course).  Bring in the recession and next thing you know you have millions of people fighting for jobs that don't exist. If anyone should be blamed for most of the problems we see in Ontario? Its the Conservatives under Mulroney."
471270,Headhunter,2010-05-31 13:30:00,5703,"Johnny, truth be told, we the people are to blame for everything we get... we vote for 'em and allow then to continue the trend. Unless and until we the people demand more from our politicions and actually take a deep interest into what they do, nothing will change. Example... the dreaded HST was anounced over one year ago. WE, ""the people"" by in large said and did nothing, now everyone is in freak mode. (justifiably, but way to late!) The more things change, the more they stay the same! HH"
471273,Musky or Specks,2010-05-31 13:50:00,2710,So who throwing the tea party?- no one we are all a bunch of pansies who are happy to bend over and say thank you sir may I have another!
471275,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 14:00:00,0," I said the same thing, though government also shares the blame as they make deals behind the scenes that the public are unaware of the consequences.  I think some people are as dumb as the bass. They hit the lure, get hooked, we release them, they remember for awhile then forget and they get hooked again and the cycle continues.  We elect people, they steal, we get mad, we vote them out of office. We calm down, the next guy starts to steal, it doesn't get discovered until well into his term, we get angry, vote him out, we calm down and the cycle continues.  As far as the HST? Its a pro business tax. And the wealthy seem to be the most vocal in all media outlets. While the people are just happy smoking a few joints, drinking some beers, buying some prostitutes and watching a few sport events and oblivious to the robbery. That is why the HST was passed. But I say its never too late."
471278,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 14:06:00,0," The tea party in the US is another sham. When a movement challenges the wealthy? What they do is they get at the head of it and then herd the people in the direction they want it to go, until it looses steam or they change the entire direction of the movement. these guys are smart and good at mass manipulation.  And yes, Canadians are more passive then Americans."
471285,torco,2010-05-31 14:32:00,656,"Well before this degenerates. I consider my self liberal minded person (small l, not the party)how true that is I'm not sure.  But ultimately it is up to us the citizen to run our government. After all democracy only exists with involvement of the citizen. So its our job to be rude and ornery when it comes to running our nation.  Easier said then done but if one looks around at how government is run today, it often works for a narrow group of wealthy elite and special interests. Once the individual becomes disengaged or apathetic from his/her government they win.  I'd say they are winning these days."
471310,pikeguy,2010-05-31 15:54:00,195, Here in Sudbury they just closed the second hospital for the new and improved hospital. Now we have less beds then ever and emerg is a 6-8 hr wait on a good day
471317,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-31 16:22:00,10439,"  Not all of us. Some had the sense of mind to get the hell out of Ontario and move to an area where the polititians listen and actually work for the people.  Oh, and Mickgwintee should have been drawn and quartered 2 weeks into his first term when he broke every promise he made during the election. But you have only yourselves to blame for re-electing the putz!!!"
471322,uglyfish,2010-05-31 16:32:00,981,"Politicians suck. Plain and simple.  On a side note, its not that it costs anymore to produce hydro at any point in the day or nite, its a matter of consumption. The more that's used, the more and faster it has to be generated. Clearly during the day there is way more megawatts or power being used then later at nite. Which is why daytime is considered prime usage time and nite is not. So while it costs the same to pruduce, its the demand that causes the issues with producing more when needed"
471330,irishfield,2010-05-31 17:00:00,26272, DANG Johnny... I didn't think you'd ever been to a Lakair G2G !
471338,Oggie,2010-05-31 17:09:00,588,Everytime I think it can't be any worse I do a dumb thing and vote in anger. I jumped from the socialist NDP who allowed loads of people to go on social assistance to the Harris government who sold the 407 and tore the heart out of nurses and hospitals. McGuinty is spending like a fool. Who needs all day juniour kindergarden... it's just bloody government daycare. He brings in the HST to keep big business happy and reaps a huge windfall to cover his spending.  I think I'll really sit down and think before I vote this time!  Dan O.
471339,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 17:10:00,0, Plus when you have the Americans feeding off our power(Niagara)also(and paying less than us). There is so called strain on the supply but I think that is just a load of crap to get the people to agree to privatizing Hydro.  And how can a grid failure in OHIO black out all of Southern Ontario? Explain that one to me!  How can Hydro prices continue to rise when the infrastructure to produce hydro has been paid off decades ago and costs next to nothing to maintain?  Now they have the excuse that they are rebuilding the infrastructure and greener energy and all that and are going to raise it another 20%. This is robbery.  These jokers are too much. Just like they are loosing money selling beer and had to privatize it and say they are loosing money selling L.C.B.O and want to privatize it. Can someone tell me how you can lose money producing alcohol at the cost we are selling it at?
471343,bigbuck,2010-05-31 17:22:00,2449,"Johnnybass, they are not losing money on the lcbo, it is one of the few money making ventures the gov't is involved in, the last I heard it contributes around a billion dollars a year to the provincial coffers. To sell it would be a travesty, they'd get a couple of billion dollars up front and that would be it, no more milk from the cow because it got slaughtered. As for hydro, we really don't pay what it costs to produce and distribute but that was subsidized out of our taxes that went to the provincial gov't. No problem with me to raise the price of hydro, just make sure the same amount gets reduced from my provincial tax bill (as if that would ever happen). Unfortunately, we are getting to the point where our vote does not count any more. Politicians don't listen. I tell this to all who live in Toronto, if you don't vote for Robbie Ford, you will be in for more of the same. Yes, he can be a buffoon, but he is a regular guy like the rest of us and loves Toronto, not a full of Bull run of the mill politician. If Toronto elects someone like him to shake up the political system, you can bet that the other politicians will start to take notice of your concerns."
471346,BUSTER,2010-05-31 17:28:00,1336,Will we ever do anything about it?
471352,Headhunter,2010-05-31 17:44:00,5703,"RE hydro prices. What I can't seem to get my head around is the fact that us individuals are subsidising industry's energy costs! Demand goes up through the day, not because of residential use, but because of industry's need for energy. However, they are demanding that I, the residential user pay for industry's energy greed. And johnny, take a look at your Electric bill, we pay a debt recovery charge every month... that, because OPG can't seem to upgrade anything within budget or time constrictions. PS... Ontario transportation minister is talking about implementing road tolls again! (For environmental purposes only! LMAO) HH"
471353,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 17:46:00,0," But that's just it. These politicians know their time is short. So they make as many backroom deals as possible selling our infrastructure to the highest bidder and still receive royalties after leaving office. It should be illegal to sell government infrastructure because it belongs to the people, not to the government.  Correct me if I am wrong bigbuck. I may sound dumb saying this but I hear they can extract electricity out of a magnet's electro magnetic field. But they need energy to extract it(to run the coils, rotors) and that is how generators produce electricity. But in the case of Niagara? The power extracting the electricity is the water that is spinning the rotors and coils producing the energy. And then all you need is a conductor(wires to transport) and transformers to regulate the voltage. This doesn't sound too expensive to me. Considering the average household pays about $1200 give or take a year.  We could seriously produce our own electricity with our waste(garbage and sewage), solar and wind power. Put a big windmill and solar panels on our homes.  Anybody but Smitherman!  yes,we need a regular joe in office."
471366,dsn,2010-05-31 18:52:00,1018,I knew there was something about him from the start. Never trust anyone who is crosseyed .They have a double standard. The left side of his brain tells him one thing and the other says  do the opposite.
