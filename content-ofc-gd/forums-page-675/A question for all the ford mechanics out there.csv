473144,Oktravis,2010-06-07 01:28:00,62,"my first thought would be the neutral safety switch,i think ford calls it the DTR sensor(Digital Transmission Range)or maybe the ignition switch.you would need to check and find out if you loosing power on 1 of the 3 positive wires at the back of the radio when its not working.i think there is 3 fuses if you don't want to take the radio out but you should also check the ground.if you are loosing a power you are going to need a wiring diagram and just trace the circuit back till you find where it went. if the radio was good you need to do the same thing on the factory amp if you have one. if all power and grounds are ok you could have a communication problem.i think that year is CAN communication .then you will need a scan tool and it could get a lot more complicated.  good luck travis"
473148,Bondar,2010-06-07 01:34:00,817,"yea i can see where this is going thanks for the tips , the radio never looses power from park to drive and what not just sound hopefully just a neutral safety switch  this could get interesting dang only had the truck since december"
