Finally we put together a few days of Brook Trout fishing. Up here, the spring has been very dry and the rivers exceptionally low. The Steelhead fishing was almost non-existent, so this trip was a breath of fresh air for a fanatic. It is still early in the Brook Trout season, but we did manage to catch and tag a few. One of the most unusual, was this football shaped hog. This male measured 21"" long, with a girth of 15"".  He weighed almost 6 lbs. and had a thick back and fat belly. Obviously, he has been feeding well. I finally bought a new 27"" Mac and redesigned my website with Freeway Pro. It has just been posted, so suggestions, PMs or emails are appreciated. Let me know what works or needs fixing. Alan http://members.shaw.ca/amuir/         "
