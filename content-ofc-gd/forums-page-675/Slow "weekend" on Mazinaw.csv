473140,siwash,2010-06-07 01:22:00,683,Went camping at Bon Echo - love that park! Fish did not cooperate however we only fished a few hours late Sat afternoon. I'm not familiar with the lake but heard the narrows are good. We tried for Pike and Walleye then switched to a lake trout troll. Nadda bite!  I wonder if the front that came through has something to do with it.  Oh well! I will be camping there 2 more times this summer.
