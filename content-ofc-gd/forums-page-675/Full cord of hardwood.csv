471531,DanD,2010-06-01 11:51:00,2223,"This maybe an unwarranted caution; but make sure that you have a recite from your wood supplier, with the location documented; as to where the wood was harvested. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is stepping up its enforcement of transporting firewood across different counties or being in the possession of wood that came from an infested area, that you do not live in or use the wood in. I was talking with a CFIA inspector (I work on their fleet cars) and he said; the only way they can hopefully limit the spread of disease (Dutch Elm) and insect infestation (Emerald Ash Bore, Gypsy Mot). Is by limiting the transportation of wood and charging people that are in possession of firewood that came from restricted areas. He said that he has laid a number of charges; which begin at 400 bucks and the confiscation of the wood. If you have a recite; you may loose the wood; but the guy selling/delivering it will get the fine. These guys (CFIA inspectors) are feds; all they need for probable cause, is to see your wood pile. Maybe call CFIA or go on-line and find out what or if there are restriction for your area. I know I cannot transport or be in the possession of firewood from here in the London area; down to/at my trailer, just outside of Turkey Point (Long Point Bay area).  Dan."
471533,lew,2010-06-01 11:55:00,12766,"Thanks BillyBob  One thing I've NEVER shied away from is hard work and like you, I'm retired and have plenty of time for whatever needs doing. I've got more than enough room for storing wood too so once I find a seller with a good price I can stock up as needed.  The wood stove in the family room will be for added heat in the home and the fireplace in the living room will only be used to look purdy when we have company"
471534,lew,2010-06-01 11:57:00,12766,"Thanks DanD, that's interesting and something I wasn't aware of."
471535,Billy Bob,2010-06-01 11:58:00,5865, Same thing is happening here in WNY.....not good. Wood prices will SPIKE.
471536,John,2010-06-01 12:12:00,2956," What Roy said...........  Also the wood guys here in the city are getting more creative every year. They are cutting the ""face cords"" 12"" long rather than 18"" and quite a lot are debarking the wood so that the layman can't tell what wood it is. They sell the bark shredded as mulch for $120 a yard!"
471574,Beans,2010-06-01 14:56:00,3339,"I haven't done the math yet for this past year (final bill will be in next month) but the first year we burned 5 bush cords @ $200 per...then I found out this was not in line with my home insurance so we cut back to 2 bush cords @$215 per and turned up the electric baseboard heaters...this resulted in an increase of $600 for electricity but 3 bush cords would have cost me $615 that year...  The year before last, Maribeth's asthma returned and we suspected the wood stove so we cut back to 1 bush cord @ $245 per for recreation fires and emergency and still have half of it left over....and no sign of her asthma returning...  Conclusion:...Doesn't seem to matter what you burn it is going to cost about the same...  BTW...wood = a lot of work and ""WORK"" is a four-letter word...  Even when you have it cut and delivered...stacking and hauling it into the house equals ""WORK"""
471585,fishhawk7,2010-06-01 15:39:00,7,"We use the guy that is on the N.W. side of line road 15 and highway 28, you turn left onto line road 15 off of 28 and it is the first right and then the first driveway on the right. He does a lot of business in the park we are in and he seems pretty good to deal with, also there is another wood place down line road 15 on the right just before you come to North school road, I have not dealt with him yet. Hope that helps."
471590,jimmer,2010-06-01 15:54:00,2730,"Hey Lew The prices have been going up constantly over the last few years.  We are now be-grudgingly paying around that price for wood.  The one piece of advice is to stack and measure the wood in 4x4x8 stacks to see if you are getting ripped off.  I order from two different guys last year.  The first guys ripped us off for almost a full face cord and would never return our calls (never use him again, buckhorn area), the second gut brought extra and made up for the first guys.  We will use him from now on. I'm starting to sway to Cliff's thinking, but the propane costs scare me off that idea.  The first step is talk my wife into the change-she loves the dry heat for her arthritis."
471611,irishfield,2010-06-01 16:54:00,26272,"Yah.. but Norm..  wood has a LOT more heat in it!!  There's the heat when you cut the tree down and limb it.  There's the heat when you cut it into 12"", 16"" or 4' lengths.  There's the heat when you split it all up nice and buzz saw those 4 footers into 12's or 16's  There's the heat when you pile it all purdy so it can dry out.  There's the heat when you unpile it and lug it into the house.  There's FINALLY the heat when you light the darn stuff...  ...and last but not least there's the heat when you haul that big ash bucket outside to dump!"
471640,Billy Bob,2010-06-01 18:33:00,5865,The one BIG advantage of heating with wood is when the power goes out you are not freezing as most furnaces need electric....in 2006 we had a huge snow storm in OCTOBER that destroyed a lot of trees and of course power was out just about everywhere....in my neighborhood we went without electric for 7 days but the house was nice and warm unlike may others that were cold and damp for many days.  Bob
471668,Big Cliff,2010-06-01 20:04:00,6899,"As far as the power going out, our fire place will work even if the power is off and at -25 it will still keep the house comfortable, also, our kitchen stove still works so we just put on a big pot of stew or whatever, I bake some bread and who cares about the power! Besides, if you love to cook like I do gas stoves are so much nicer to use!  Now last year I did buy a 6500 watt generator because no power = no running water, I had an electrician wire it into the panel and all I have to do is flip 3 breakers and turn a key and we have power to run the whole house.  As far as the cost of propane, I negotiate every fall for a fixed price and usually end up paying about $0.05 a liter less than the going rate. We use about 4000L per year and because of the kitchen stove and water heater, our hydro bills are typically less than $110.00 a month average. We have 1500 sq' on each of two floors.  Wood is nice, no doubt about it but as Wayne pointed out so well, there is a ton of work involved. One of the reasons I made the change is that if something happened to me, if I got sick or anything Sue would not have been able to haul the wood and keep the fires going. It also makes it difficult to go away in the winter time.  Anyway Lew, I am sure you have thought this out well and you will enjoy the wood heat and the smell of the smoke. It is a comfortable warm heat! If I was young enough and had the time I might still be heating with wood."
471703,irishfield,2010-06-01 21:53:00,26272,"It's a lot of work, Cliff, for sure... but with 120 acres of hardwood forest surrounding the house.. 3 airtight Napoleon fireplaces in the house and my grandmothers old parlor stove as my main source of heat in my 30 x 60 workshop... it keeps me in shape!!"
471707,Terry,2010-06-01 22:06:00,14456,"I burnt wood exclusively for 7 years  and it is a lot of woooooorrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkk   after doing the math of cutting splitting transporting it, I discovered that working overtime a few weekends at my job paid more for my fuel budget, then the hours and hours of cutting and splitting and transporting and piling and piling and piling and carrying it into the house ..love the heat hate the work"
472722,fish_fishburn,2010-06-05 12:45:00,1311,"I have been heating my house exclusively with wood for 13 yrs. If your afraid of a bit of hard work, don't even bother with wood heat. I have been using the same supplier for about 10 yrs now. If you can find a good supplier stay with him and he will take good care of you. My wood cost me about 225 a full chord and it is split and seasoned when I pick it up. I only have to haul it about 4 miles. I use about 3 chords on average per winter. By the way I only buy oak from my supplier. I find there is way less ash and it burns longer and way more heat than birch or maple. You need a good woodshed to store your wood in. I know of people who fill their basements with wood so they don't have to go outside to bring wood in during the winter, but you introduce your house to lots of bugs. My stove is a high efficient air tight made in canada by Osburn. They run around 1500 now days. In my opinion there is no nicer heat then wood, it's dry and so toasty but will have to have a pot of water on your stove to add humidity or all your wood furniture will start to fall apart haha and your skin will become dry like a snake. Not only that when the ladies come over for drinks on friday or sat evenings I always throw another log on so they remove them big winter sweaters they always wear in the winter"
472725,Billy Bob,2010-06-05 12:50:00,5865,The DRY heat wood presents is GREAT for my RA....
472733,lew,2010-06-05 13:32:00,12766,"Interesting that this thread popped back to the surface this morning as I just had my new stove installed yesterday, along with delivery the 1st of 3 cords of hardwood that I ordered. Ended up going with Jer's wood guy and got it for $260 per cord.  As mentioned previously in this thread, the house is heated with oil, plus I have a nice fireplace in the livingroom and now the new stove has gone downstairs in the family room.  Hate to say it, but I'm almost lookind forward to some cold weather to try it out.....well, maybe not  "
472749,Billy Bob,2010-06-05 14:44:00,5865,"Lew, it looks GREAT...did you get the glass inscribed ?  Here's what ours looks like....    One load of Hickory read to be unloaded and stacked...grrrrr....    ANY VOLUNTEERS....."
471403,lew,2010-05-31 21:35:00,12766,"Guys, I've got a fireplace in the living room, plus I'm having a woodburning stove installed down in the family room so I'm gonna be buying  a couple cords of wood for next winter.....ya I know, it's 80 degrees outside today  I was referred to a local guy and talked to him today and he sells  a full cord of seasoned hardwood, cut to 16"", split and delivered to my home for $300 including taxes.  Decent price or not ??"
471408,Jer,2010-05-31 21:48:00,1426,"I paid a little less than that for my wood this year, Lew, $260 a cord. If it's good wood and split to a size you like, $300 is not really a bad price.  I found that once you find a good wood guy and buy for a couple years, your price will start to decline relative to the going rate. I buy 3 or 4 cords a year and heat exclusively with wood."
471409,Bernie,2010-05-31 21:48:00,3190,"Whew, not too cheap Lew. Although down there it may be in line. Brought 2 cords  of Maple to the cottage last winter, cut and split for $140. I had to pick it up but it was only a kilometer out of my way."
471412,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-31 21:51:00,10439,"Check with lumber mills in the area. When I lived in Grand Valley we used to buy wood off a wood flooring mill for $70 a dump truck load!!! Delivered!!!! It was a smaller dump truck so we ended up with a pile that filled our 6X6X6 wood bin. Mind you it was all off cuts and they weren't uniform size but we created a covered bin to store it in. Nothing better than kiln dried oak, maple, cherry and walnut fer burning!!!"
471414,Big Cliff,2010-05-31 21:59:00,6899,"I think that is high Lew, I haven't bought wood for a few years now but the going rate for cut, seasoned split hard wood was about $225.00 a bush cord when I did. You could also look at buying a truck load of logs and cutting and splitting it yourself!"
471415,Jer,2010-05-31 22:00:00,1426,   You must have a big truck...
471416,Jer,2010-05-31 22:04:00,1426,"  It's certainly cheaper if you want to do the work yourself. Still a big investment though, I believe the average ""truck load"" of logs will yeild 14 bush cords or so (It may be only seven, I don't really remember)."
471417,Bernie,2010-05-31 22:04:00,3190, Ha. It wasn't all brought over in one trip. I run it across in the winter over the lake.
471425,John,2010-05-31 22:44:00,2956, Here in the city I would thankfully pay $300 a full cord delivered!!!!
471432,Sharkbait22,2010-05-31 23:15:00,297,I lived in Lakefield not too long ago.  I was getting a chord for 225 - 250 in the end. Ask around.  Best to get the wood now so you can dry it out. So it's good you are looking now. There is a guy on the west side of 28 bw Young's Point and Burleigh you could try. Kingdon Lumber in Lakefield has a bin of scrap wood good for kindling.
471433,Mike the Pike,2010-05-31 23:17:00,3421,OMG Lew I have never heard of such high wood prices in my life.  I pay $90.00 per cord delivered here in Saint-Hubert high quality hard Maple.  Only in Ontario eh
471435,Roy,2010-05-31 23:28:00,13728,"Mike, Lew's talking cord...what you're getting in St Hubert is a face cord."
471436,Jer,2010-05-31 23:28:00,1426,"  I have a friend who lives in Bracebridge. When he first moved there, he told me he bought 10 cords of wood for the upcoming winter. I thought he was nuts, how could he need so much wood?  Apparently, in Muskoka, a ""face cord"" is referred to as a ""cord"". A bush cord (as I've always known a cord of wood) is of course 3 face cords deep. He actually only had 3 1/3 cords of wood, which made much more sense.  If a ""bush cord"" is only $90 in Quebec, along with the beer prices, maybe I should move my   to La Belle Province."
471439,motv8tr,2010-05-31 23:39:00,2587,"I've paid from 250 to 300 for a full cord, I go through about 3-4 a year here.  Maureen"
471441,irishfield,2010-05-31 23:43:00,26272,"If it's oak and maple Lew it's the going price for seasoned wood. I haven't seen an advert in the bargain trader for less than $280 to $320 per BUSH cord.. (that's 4' x 4' x 8 ' of wood Mike the Pike!) for REAL hardwood. Don't let someone give you a load of Poplar and Birch for that money!  Considering the work and gas involved I don't think I could even sell it for that price unless I had a Cord King automatic cutter/splitter. You sure couldn't make a decent living with a saw and a tractor run splitter if you want to get anything for your valuable trees.  Now if you wanna come up to my place and go for it... you are more than welcome to do your own wood from my forest and the usual deal is I get 2 cords.. you get 3, for using your equipment, you doing the work and taking my trees."
471442,lew,2010-05-31 23:44:00,12766,"Thanks guys, I just got back home.  Seems some here think $300 is high while others don't think it's too bad of a price, so I'll do a bit more searching around. This is the 1st time I've ever bought a full cord of hardwood so I wasn't too sure what a fair price was.  And yes, this is for a full cord rather than a face cord.  Jer, could you please PM me the name or phone # of your wood guy. I'm probably gonna buy at least 2 cords so if I can save $40 off each one that'll be a substantial savings.  Sharkbait22, the guy on 28 between Youngs Pt and Burliegh is the one I was talking to today, perhaps I'll see what he can offer me for 2 cords."
471445,Bernie,2010-06-01 00:02:00,3190,"I was in error about the cord, should have realized. Mine was 70 for a single cord but he cut it 18"" and still was 4x8."
471446,TJQ,2010-06-01 00:06:00,7806,Ya.... face cord 4 feet high by 16 inches by 8 feet.... full cord 4 x 4 x 8 (3 face cords) if its really good wood and its delivered $300 ain't bad. .. if its great wood.
471470,wallyboss,2010-06-01 01:10:00,1095,$125.00 for a face cord around Ottawa. So I would say that $300.00 for a full cord is not bad at all.
471474,darsky,2010-06-01 01:23:00,586,"makes me laugh when someone quotes me a price and says ""tax included"". Try asking for a receipt for tax purposes."
471497,bigbuck,2010-06-01 03:03:00,2449,"Lew, that is not too bad a price. See what you can get off of him for 2 cords, you might save a few bucks (maybe 20-50 or so). What about picking it up yourself?? How much will you save. Firewood is not cheap, esp. considering it literally goes up in smoke like gas for the vehicles incl. the boat. Don't forget the stacking party with a couple of strong backs and an afternoon fishing for muskies. I paid $200 for a bush cord of really really dry hardwood last year but it burns real fast and really hot and would not be suitable for a woodstove. The campfire, sure, anything that burns but for home you have to be a bit more picky."
471516,Big Cliff,2010-06-01 09:59:00,6899,"Lew, when we moved in here there was a beautiful wood burning fire place in the basement family room. First year I cut and hauled wood and bought wood. It was beautiful, the sound of the fire as sparks flew out onto the floor, the smell of the smoke but it was also a lot of work and not very efficient.  By the third year I had put an insert in the fire place, much more efficient but you still had the sound of the fire and the smell of the smoke. Mind you hauling, stacking, carrying the wood and cleaning up were still there.  Year 6 I had the wood insert removed and a gas insert put in, The fire is still beautiful but now when I want it I flip a switch, it is on a thermostat so no more having to open a window in Jan. because it got too hot. No more bugs and stuff from the wood or pails of ashes to have to haul and it still works even if the hydro goes out.  I have now converted my whole house to propane, cook stove, water heater, furnace, fireplace, and my two BBQ's are hooked up to the main tank. Total gas bills less than $3000.00 a year. You might want to re consider before you go out and buy all that wood."
471517,lew,2010-06-01 10:41:00,12766,"Thanks again everyone, I've got a couple phone numbers for some local wood guys and will be calling them today.  Cliff, I understand where your coming from but I've always been a big fan of the airtight woodstoves. I won't be doing any cutting, other than kindling, and the wood will all be stored in a large portable shed I've installed behind the garage so it'll be easy to get at."
471525,Billy Bob,2010-06-01 11:34:00,5865,"I have been heating with a wood burning stove for about 7-8 years now and I have to agree with Cliff that it is a LOT of work. However, my house is nice and warm with temps in the mid 70's unlike most homes here that use natural gas and their homes are best at 68 degrees. Since I'm retired I have the time to bring in the wood, etc.......  As far as wood prices here in WNY......in the Buffalo area they are getting between $80 - $125 per FACE cord with delivery ""available""....if I had to pay this much for wood I wouldn't heat with it....I have been getting my wood for the last 5 years at $50 per FACE cord but I have to haul it from 23 miles away. However, it's 80-85% hickory, some ash, some sugar maple and some black cherry. It's always CLEAN, dried and split properly.I go through just around 6 cords per year.  If you have the room I would buy twice the amount you require and let the extra dry some more...for a good wood burner the drier the better IMHO as you can adjust the air flow which controls the burn rate.  In use to have a website saved (before computer crashed) that gave the BTU's from each kind of wood....with Locust being the best.  The fireplace will cost you a LOT of BTU's as it will cause a draft and draw out the heat from your home...heating from a fireplace is near nil. After a year or two you will see for yourself that a fireplace is nice to look at but not to heat one's home.   Bob"
