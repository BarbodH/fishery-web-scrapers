We got a little water in the basement this morning through a crack in the cellar wall but nothing a little wet vacuuming and mopping couldn't handle....but in 29 years here that the most I have ever seen in my basement. However, the Nation Weather Service reports 2.72 inches in the last four days and more coming....  ...wish it would of went north to you guys or did you get some also... http://www.buffalonews.com/2010/06/05/1071935/raucous-storm-drops-heavy-rain.html  Bob"

473061,Billy Bob,2010-06-06 18:16:00,5865,"A fellow volunteer firefighter called me and asked why I wasn't on patrol at the flooded viaduct on the main rd.....I said, I couldn't because I had my own problems here with water and was just about to run to the store and find a oscillating fan to help dry out my basement. Pete replied, don't bother I have two and I'm on my way over....keep them as long as you want...  So I'm back in service for the next emergency call and with the forecast it could be tonight..."
