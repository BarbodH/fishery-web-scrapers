Maybe I can get a couple jigs back this weekend!  Have a look at this Tiger Musky, I was lucky enough to land this yesterday. Caught it on a hair jig with 20 lb power pro braid, not even a nick in the braid.    Cheers & Tight Lines!  @http://twitter.com/RedsFishin"

472622,Handlebarz,2010-06-04 21:43:00,3790,Dang that sure is a great looking Tiger the color is great Hope to find one of them this year.
472631,addymark,2010-06-04 22:46:00,69,would these potentially be in any body of water where pike and muskie co-exist?
472632,Roy,2010-06-04 22:48:00,13728, Yes they would.
472641,BillM,2010-06-04 23:40:00,17367,"Man, that fish rivals a brookie for looks!"
472654,John Bacon,2010-06-05 00:40:00,3277," Yes, especially if pike have recently invaded or been introduced to a lake that has traditionally been a muskie lake.  It does not seem to happen as often in lakes where pike and muskie have co-existed for a long time."
