I fish Simcoe quite a bit and unlike most bass anglers, I only throw tubes about 17% of the time.  I would guess that I have a crankbait tied to my line 75% of the time.  Anyone want to guess what colour I use?  Have a look at the pic Scary thing is that those aren't even all my crayfish coloured cranks. "
472694,limeyangler,2010-06-05 03:02:00,5204,i'm just a little envious of your stash of wiggle warts  darn i love those lures...wallies also luv 'em
472758,misfish,2010-06-05 15:16:00,29133,Whats that top left one? I rarely throw crank baits.Mostly tubes and jerk baits and spinnerbaits.  Nice collection.
472787,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-05 18:10:00,0,"Me too. I use only tubes, grubs and spinner baits. The only time I will use stick baits for smallies is in the fall on georgian bay. I have a few of those and will give them a shot!!!"

472876,Cudz,2010-06-06 02:17:00,2652,"This is a BPS lure called the egg.  All I am going to say is go out and get one.   Mike, You have some quality lures there.  You've been watching JP and Dave quite a bit I see. As I said earlier, that collection that I have posted is only my crayfish coloured lures, and not even all the crayfish coloured ones I own.  I also have that many cranks in silver and white and again in chartreuse and perch colours.  It is gross when I think how much $$ has been spent on cranks."
472905,singingdog,2010-06-06 10:05:00,1047,"Yep, crankbaits are the crack of bass fishing....sooo many colours, sooo many depths, soooo many different wiggles. I ventured a short way down that road last year only to discover the one-ton jighead."
