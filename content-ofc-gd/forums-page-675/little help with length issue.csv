But seriously folks, if I recall correctly the Highway Traffic Act says you have to red flag anything that protrudes more than 2 metres, but it's been a while since I've read one. You can find the HTA on-line here."

472681,Dave Bailey,2010-06-05 02:30:00,1641,"Okay, here's the relevant law:  111.  (1)  Every vehicle carrying a load which overhangs the rear of the vehicle to the extent of 1.5 metres or more while on a highway shall display upon the overhanging load at the extreme rear end thereof at any time from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise, or at any other time when there is insufficient light or unfavourable atmospheric conditions, a red light, and at all other times a red flag or a red marker sufficient to indicate the projection of the load. R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 111 (1)."
472683,purekgw,2010-06-05 02:35:00,585,so from what im seeing its all the same so i just need a red light at night

472708,bushart,2010-06-05 11:07:00,2628,I believe if you check the MNR regs it's illegal to bait an artist between the months of May and Sept.
472723,pikeguy,2010-06-05 12:46:00,195,    have you thought about getting a rack for the truck? Then it would not hang of the back and you would still have your box to put stuff in.
