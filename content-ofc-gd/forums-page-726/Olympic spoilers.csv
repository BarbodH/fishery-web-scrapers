433424,kickingfrog,2010-02-15 14:40:00,8333,"Hi guys,  I realize many of us are pumped about the Olympics, including me, but we all have different work, family and play schedules. As well as many different ways to watch the games.  I am asking you not to post results in your topic title or topic description. Cheer, boo, critique and lament all you want ""inside"" your post, just not where someone will not have a choice not to view what you are posting.  The simple fact is that is if I have to chose between this site and the Olympics for the next two weeks I will chose the Olympics. That is a decision that I don't want to make because I love this place.  Thank you.  GO CANADA!!!"
433427,Twocoda,2010-02-15 14:48:00,4130,actually its not a unreasonable request ....but i hope whatever is keeping you from watching the games in real time is in total isolation cuz the news travels fast..
433435,BillM,2010-02-15 15:23:00,17367,"Yup, a simple 'SPOILER' tag in the subject should give people even warning..."
433439,kickingfrog,2010-02-15 15:46:00,8333," Agreed. Radio off in the car and the house, friends and family know better, I also change the internet home page so that nothing is spoiled. Sometimes I may only be a few minutes behind live tv, but that is enough to ruin a night of chest thumpin' tv watchin' good times.  I still will not forgive the guy who told me the result of the Canada v Russia Olympic game 4 years ago... after I had told him I was taping the game. Jerk!"
433441,Syn,2010-02-15 15:55:00,519,Suggestion: Why don't we just have one Olympic thread then people can just keep adding posts to that instead of multiple threads for every Olympic update.
433570,Dara,2010-02-15 22:25:00,3052,I am gonna get myself in some real trouble here
433614,Radnine,2010-02-15 23:36:00,1538,  Then chose the olympics and let us post how we like. Talk to you in a couple of weeks and thanks for writing! Jim

433630,JohnF,2010-02-15 23:58:00,3494," Some of you might have to talk to yerselves if all the Olympics fans had to do that, but hey, it's one way of being right all the time.  JF"

434188,Fisherman,2010-02-17 12:14:00,7201," Now who the hell is Tony, I thought he left to go to NY."
