I certainly had a stake in it...  getting people out to the G2G and promoting the event is part of my JOB around here .. yes.. its true... promotion  OMG.  Do we promote the show??? Yes...  Do we go to the show... yes....  do our clients, friends and members go to the show... yes...  Did I spend the time to give out $700 worth of FREE entries to the show, gather names and mail them?? yes.   Did the show pay me dime one for any of that???  NO.  They were just happy to get some juice on our board while allowing ALOT of our members to get in gratis.  Please enlighten me as to what your reading between the lines that I'm unaware of???  Did you go to the show?? Was it not what you expected??  Your post is pretty ambiguous, and Id really like to know what you mean??"
