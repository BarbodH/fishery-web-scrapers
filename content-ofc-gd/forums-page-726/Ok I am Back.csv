434014,Mike the Pike,2010-02-16 22:54:00,3421,Hi guys finally back.Unfortunately I did not have much time for OFC lately.  I am pleased to say my father came home from the hospital today after a 2 and a half month stay.  He had 2 surgerys one to clean out some arteries and another to repare an Aortic aneurysm.  All his operations have been successful now comes the long road to recovery.With alot of rest he will be absolutely A OK.I guess I can now resume fishing soon.      MTP
