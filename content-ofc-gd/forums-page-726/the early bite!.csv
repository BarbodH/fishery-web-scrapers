433377,pike slayer,2010-02-15 03:50:00,1177,So tomorrow morning im suppose to be meeting my buddy out in goulais(20min north of the sault) for 7am to head to our fishing hole which is a 5-10min snowmobile ride. i keep telling him that we are going out wayyyy to early and they wont even bite till atleast 9am! i've been fishing for a while and i know the early bird doesnt get the worm. so what do you guys think?!?? is there actually an early bite or does my luck just suck in the morning and that im a softie?? haha!! ohhh and i can understand getting up early to go some place far away so you can fish the day!
433379,pikeie,2010-02-15 03:52:00,380,didnt get a hit in the hut today untill after 9....
433381,redneck666,2010-02-15 04:04:00,563,"I THIRD THAT! lol. when i go out, whether it be walleye pike, bass or whiteies..... even trout, theres usually action all day long.... went to a pond one time early, early morning and not a fish till about 10:30am.... catfish that is. little 1 1/2lb guy"
433383,cram,2010-02-15 04:07:00,1733,"ice fishing and early spring, late fall can be different -- but in the warmer months early morning is definitely where its at.  I often pack up and go home at 9am."
433384,redneck666,2010-02-15 04:12:00,563,cram you got a point.  makes sense on the warm days that the fishin would be better early. not for me though! all day long! hahaha.
433385,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-15 04:14:00,0,see ya out there dangles.
433386,pike slayer,2010-02-15 04:19:00,1177,we'll be on the shoal out in the middle of the lake dr.sal. you'll hear my buddy coming with his fusion 900 with a big bore kit and its all piped hahah wake up those fish!! ohh and stop and say hello or if i see you i'll stop. i'll be looking for the all mighty legend!
433389,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-15 04:28:00,0,i'll be there late.  i'm sleeping in.  haha i probably won't be on the lake until 10:15. i'm guessin it's a zoo tomorrow.
433391,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 04:38:00,618,Never really did well in the morning except for Salmon fishing in the river.  When me you eazy and the other guys went to Round lake last month and you proved that whole thing about the bite starting as soon as the sun breaks through the clouds and hits the ice darn suprised me
433392,pike slayer,2010-02-15 04:39:00,1177,ya it'll probably be a zoo by the time you get there all the hung over goulais folk will just be hitting the lake. im getting there early get my lakers then off on a speck hunt
433405,Joey,2010-02-15 11:55:00,9122,"I don't believe in the morning bite.  Never did well for me.  Yet here I am ready to head out the door, ha ha ha.  Joey"
433527,pike slayer,2010-02-15 21:15:00,1177,hahaha well i jinxed myself today!! i have no problem with that!!
434071,danbouck,2010-02-17 01:08:00,4380,If I say to myself that there is a morning bite then I end up with a longer day on the water!
434124,Sudzy,2010-02-17 03:04:00,88,Only applies in certain situations I think (ie. Topwater fishing)  Otherwise I agree.
434128,Dutchy,2010-02-17 03:12:00,416,"I think it is alot of garbage. Never caught that many fish in the morning, especially chromes, they seem less than active."
434171,Raf,2010-02-17 07:40:00,3495,"depends on the lake, sometimes even the spots.  for whatever reason there are lakes/spots that produce early morning  and are done by 10am."
434246,wallyboss,2010-02-17 15:38:00,1095,"Depends on the spot.   I have some early walleye spots that if you are not there 1 hour before sunrise you will miss the bite, and by 7:30am they are nowhere to be found."
434263,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-17 17:41:00,0,"If you don't go you won't know. Of course there is an early bite. Fish bite at all times of day. Before sun up...after sun up, before lunch after lunch...before dinner and again after dinner.......it all depends on if you are there when they decide to eat is all. Some species are more predictable than others as well.  Go fish..."
434269,Spiel,2010-02-17 18:22:00,9065,"Absolutely there's an early morning bite, especially with fish that don't feed through the night. If your not connecting till later in the morning you're likely starting out in the wrong spot."
434287,tightline,2010-02-17 19:38:00,322,"We usually drop the boat in at the crack of dawn, and pull'r out at sunset...shore lunches and naps on beaches where you can find'm...Never gone home empty handed for lack of trying..Some of the biggest fish I have ever been in the boat when caught have been mid afternoon, maybe a couple in the early morning but the majority has been later in the day."
434292,Fish4Eyes,2010-02-17 20:15:00,1022,"Right place at the right time is key. Generally speaking, I have had the most success in the evenings, but oddly enough my best day pickerel fishing last year was at noon, go figure."
434315,bubbles,2010-02-17 21:03:00,591,"I think it is dependant on th species and the time of year, water temp etc......  Walleye in SW ONT in the spring and fall, there IS and early morning bite."
434339,ozaibak1,2010-02-17 22:26:00,401,"I've definitely noticed a morning bite fishing for bass in the summer. For each hour after sunrise, there is a 50% drop in numbers till noon hits at which time it goes dead. This is in under 15 feet of water, I think the fish go deeper which is another factor.  Tell me this, if there ain't no such thing as a morning bite, why are y'all getting up at 4am to go fishing??"
434343,redneck666,2010-02-17 22:45:00,563, maybe cause his partner believes in it......? dont know.
