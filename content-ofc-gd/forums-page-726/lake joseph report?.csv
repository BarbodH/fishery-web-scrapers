433994,waterwolf,2010-02-16 21:58:00,556,a good friend  and i are planning on lake joe this weekend.  problem is that we don't have a sled and the walk is of concern to me with regards to snow depth.  he's a good buddy but i'm not draggin' his fossil butt off the ice 'cause he's winded. {especially if he out-fishes me}  any info would be much appreciated.

Snowmobile trails are all over but no cosistent pathways to take advantage on. I was very glad to get a ride out on Monday. We walked a good way out and I was soaked pulling a Clam"
