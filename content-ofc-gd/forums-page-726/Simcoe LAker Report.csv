They didnt mind the extra company so we all headed out in search of some trout.  The day started a little late, setting up shop at around 8:30am in 90feet of water.  The snow got heavy and the fish were moving through pretty good but not showing a lot of interest.  Dropped spoons, bad boyz, jiggin raps, laker takers to no avail.  Around 9:30, one client called for help as I was in the other hut.  Arrived to see his rod buckled as he was doing battle with his first lake trout.  I saw it flash and knew it was a good fish.  Got it to the hole and into his hands, an 11 pound thing of beauty.  The fish was not able to be released unfortunately, but it wont be put to waste as his wife was happy to hear of the catch hahaha.  For the next 3 hours, the fishing was pretty steady and between the 4 of us we put 10 more through the hole.  Most of the fish were taken on my zonker jig, but 2 on a laker taker and 1 on a tube.  The bite slowed at around 1pm and we missed a few hits and called it a day at around 4pm and we all headed home happy.  Good day out!    "
