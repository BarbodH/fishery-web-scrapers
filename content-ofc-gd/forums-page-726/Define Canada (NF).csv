VANCOUVER, B.C. - A transcript of Shane Koyczan's poem, ""We Are More,"" as delivered during the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Olympic Games:  ""Define Canada  You might say the home of the Rocket  Or The Great One  Who inspired little No. 9s and little No. 99s  But we're more than just hockey and fishing lines  Off of the rocky coast of the Maritimes  And some say what defines us  Is something as simple as 'please' and 'thank you'  And as for 'you're welcome,' well, we say that, too  But we are more than genteel or civilized  We are an idea in the process of being realized  We are young, we are cultures strung together then woven into a tapestry  And the design is what makes us more than the sum totals of our history  We are an experiment going right for a change  With influences that range from A to Zed  And yes, we say 'Zed' instead of 'Zee'  We are the brightness of Chinatown and the laughter of Little Italy  We dream so big that there are those  Who would call our ambition an industry  Because we are vineyards of good year after good year  We reforest what we clear  Because we believe in generations beyond our own  Knowing now that so many of us  Have grown past what we used to be  We can stand here today  Filled with all the hope people have  When they say things like 'someday'  Because we are more  Than a laundry list of things to do and places to see  More than hills to ski  Or countryside ponds to skate  We are the abandoned hesitation of all those who can't wait  We are first-rate greasy spoon diners and healthy living cafes  A country that is all the ways you choose to live  A nation that can give you variety  Because we are choices  We are millions upon millions of voices  Shouting, keep exploring  We are more  We are the surprise the world has in store for you, it's true  Canada is the 'what' in 'what's new'  So don't let your luggage define your travels  Each life unravels differently  And experiences are what make up  The colours of our tapestry  We are the true North  Strong and free  And what's more  Is that we didn't just say it  We made it be"""
433908,JohnF,2010-02-16 17:32:00,3494,Thanks for posting that. I really liked hearing it recited at the opening but missed parts of it.  JF
433933,Paully,2010-02-16 18:59:00,712,They talked about this guy on 102.1 this morning.. anyone catch it?
433987,Jigger,2010-02-16 21:35:00,1237,"I honestly thought that he was going to throw""I AM Canadian"" in there somewhere. Spoken word can really suck sometimes. But I think that guy did a great job."
434004,bushart,2010-02-16 22:26:00,2628,There are countless beautiful things in this world to see and visit---but this is the only place I'd call home (And I twice considered Bora Bora)  Bushart  
434089,cram,2010-02-17 01:46:00,1733,"I love it, but there's a bit of ""we're better than americans"" tone to it.  The Olympic opening ceremonies was not the right venue for it, IMO.  By comparison the thing on Canada that NBC did prior to the openign ceremonies was remarkably good (and on point for context)"
434096,Radnine,2010-02-17 02:01:00,1538, I think that I agree with this. Well put. Jim
434097,JohnF,2010-02-17 02:03:00,3494," I didn't get that from it at all. To me it was just a spot on jibe at those who think there's something wrong with us Canucks being polite at times.  And though I can't say I'm completely comfortable with our new cockiness about ""owning the podium"" etc I do kind of get a kick out of the British (and a few Canuck) journalists who think it's awful for Canadians to be so bold. I agree with whoever it was who said ""Fortune favours the bold"". Polite is great in a social context but it really sux in snowboard cross, or in hockey as our boys found in the first period tonight. I see they've become a tad rude, and are winning now. I'll go with bold for competition and polite for social situations. I was interested to note that most American commentator/writers also liked the new Canuck persona.  JF"
434104,cram,2010-02-17 02:20:00,1733," Love us (or rather, don't hate us) because we're polite. We say zed instead of zee. Its not a lot, but it probably made no sense to anyone not in Canada or the US (or someone familiar with our contrasts).  It was a brilliant poem, and one i really enjoy re-reading (thanks for posting Rick!)....just wasn't the right forum for it in the opening ceremonies, IMO.  Just think the opening ceremonies should have been about the olympics and entertaining our guests....not about ""how great we canadians are"".   I guarantee that poem resonated with no one outside Canada."
434342,grt1,2010-02-17 22:38:00,638,"when they announced there was going to be a poem I thought ""Oh great, just what we need some lame poem""  was I ever wrong, this guy did something I didn't expect.  He made me proud to be Canadian by way of a poem.  Thanks for putting the text of the poem on the board, it is one I could read many times and never feel bored"
434346,vinnimon,2010-02-17 22:48:00,2593,"I missed the opening ceremonies  Thanks Rick for posting it.A proud first generation canadian I am, EH."
434347,JohnF,2010-02-17 22:52:00,3494,"Along that same line I've been really impressed (proud - whatever) with our Canadian athletes who've been winning. They have really done a good job of representing the Canadian persona (the one we'd like folks to see). They've been modest, polite, unassuming, and grateful. I'm talking mostly about the baggy pants set, the boarders and mogul racers. On a petty personal note I was more than happy to see the American board crosser, Holland, crash and burn. I know I should be a bigger man but I'm so glad that tubby little walking mouth isn't one of ours. On the other hand some of the American kids have been great.  Anyway, in the face of the criticism being tossed Canada's way for our newfound cockiness (Own The Podium etc) it's nice to see that our winners are really nice kids. I like the new national pride thing. I've never liked our national  inferiority complex. It's about time we showed some nads on the national stage, and backed it up.  That's my 2 cents worth. YMMV.  JF"
434351,holdfast,2010-02-17 23:30:00,1813," I agree, and everyone that thinks we should or are nice and polite, just play for personal best, havent seen any Canadian Hockey.  We want to own that Podium.  Go Canada Go.  Thanks for the posts"
