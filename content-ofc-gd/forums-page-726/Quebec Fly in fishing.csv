We've done plenty of research online and think we know of all outfitters from Sudbury to Nakina. We've tried to investigate northern Quebec but haven't found too much. There's alot of lakes and rivers up there, there should be some outpost camps too. We've found Caesars and Melacon, anybody know of any others that would be worth checking out? thanks in advance"
