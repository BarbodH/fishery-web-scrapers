434125,MSBruno,2010-02-17 03:04:00,369,I just saw this on their website and never heard anything about this nor a launch of it.  Anyone?  http://www.seaguar.com/products/tatsu.htm

434164,EC1,2010-02-17 05:58:00,930,"Agreed with solo. I saw it at first, and was very keen to try until I saw the price tag.  If I do ever get this stuff though, I think I might have to put another leader on it so I won't use it up too quickly.  I can see though, a single backlash on the baitcaster that can't be undone and it will ruin an entire fishing trip."
