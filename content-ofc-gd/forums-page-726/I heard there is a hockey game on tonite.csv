434086,Rich Clemens,2010-02-17 01:43:00,3131,Normally I don't watch hockey ... but Team Canada is really looking good into the 2nd period.    Seem to have really good puck movement and control.    GO TEAM CANADA
434092,Rizzo,2010-02-17 01:50:00,4754,"I give the Norwegians credit. They played really solid hockey the first period for a bunch of non-nhl'ers. Now in the second Canada is starting to wear them down, but they are definitely better than I would have expected."
