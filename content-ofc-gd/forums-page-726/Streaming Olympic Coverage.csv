433975,blaque,2010-02-16 20:45:00,2419,Anyone know if you can watch the Olympics online? Im in the states btw. I tried nbcolympics.com and it says watch live now.........but takes me to nowhere lol
433979,JohnF,2010-02-16 20:56:00,3494,"I've been watching live streaming Olympics coverage (curling, hockey & snowboarding) on CTV and TSN but when I tried to watch the Junior Hockey tournament on TSN while I was in Mexico it was blocked outside Canada.  JF"
433992,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-16 21:52:00,10439,"Yep: Streaming Olympic coverage  Click on one of the viewers guide- watch online links on the right.  As John says I don't know if it will be available south of the border though.  I'm streaming it here at the college through our student information system. It's a bunch of 26"" flatscreen LCD's placed all over the college.  I figure it's the olympics so the students don't need to know squat!!!!"

434229,JohnF,2010-02-17 14:55:00,3494, Some of those sites are restricted to Canadian IP addies. I discovered that in the States & Mexico when I tried to watch the Junior hockey.  JF
434233,evster,2010-02-17 15:01:00,367,"Oh ya.  Whoops.  It definitely is restricted to Canada, I just didn't read the original post carefully enough.  Sorry."
434241,blaque,2010-02-17 15:11:00,2419," I gave it a shot........lol,  had to try, but yeah,........no dice. Thanks though"
434258,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-17 17:00:00,10439, You should have left you computer on up here and configured your firewall to allow RDP (remote desktop protocol). Then you could remote into your Canadian computer and watched the Olympics that way.
434267,jace,2010-02-17 18:05:00,472,"  Or even better, set it up a cheap proxy server on a P2 here then you can surf/connect anywhere that filters out non-canadian IP ranges.    and no hop lags"
434270,blaque,2010-02-17 18:27:00,2419, I dont have a computer up there lol........i live down here haha
434278,Rhombeus,2010-02-17 19:10:00,4,"If you really want to get streaming coverage from CTV you can get a vpn account which will effectively give you a Canadian IP.  I am doing this from South America right now, and it works well.  There are many different vpn providers out there, but I am using http://www.purevpn.com/ for about $6/month.  You can buy just one month if you like.  Once your account is setup, they will email you instructions on how to configure your computer, which is fairly straight forward.  I know NBC is even more restrictive than CTV - you need a US ip address, and you must be subscribing to a cable package which includes NBC, and have some kind of account with your cable provider that you use to login to the NBC site."
434291,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-17 20:01:00,10439,"  Well, that's your own fault then!!! Sorry about your luck!!!!"
434296,blaque,2010-02-17 20:22:00,2419,"Well maybe, ..... when some of you river gurus got together you could show a little canadian hospitality..... and hold a ""bring a yank fishing"" day, I'd get up there more often"
