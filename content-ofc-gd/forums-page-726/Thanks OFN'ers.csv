433810,Dave Mercer,2010-02-16 13:02:00,148,"Good Morning All, Just wanted to send you all a quick note to say how great it was to see you all this weekend. I was totally blown away by the giant crowds at my seminars which of course where anchored by the great crew from OFC. For some reason many of you were in the the back row - not sure why. There must have been something drawing you all back there. Whatever it was that drew you all back there must have made you thirsty. Because I saw you were all parched and often had cold drinks in your hands - lol! Still not sure what it was but I will figure it out one day. Then again maybe I did figure it out, something must be going around because the whole crew of us found ourselves thirsty on Sat night- lol.  All in all just wanted to thank you all for your support as always you guys are awesome. Sorry It took me so long to get over there and hang with you all. I think TJ has come up with a plan to make the G2G a lot better for next year. It will be a blast I promise you all!  Hope to see you all again at my Bass Pro shows in March. I am planning something cool.  Dave Mercer"
