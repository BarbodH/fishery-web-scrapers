431493,limeyangler,2010-02-09 19:19:00,5204, LOLOL...i just watched it too....take that front draggers indeed!  I'm just gonna go back to the site and check the weight on the thing...see if the front drag adds a lot of weight...   I think i know what to ask the wife for for my birthday in March.....
431740,CLofchik,2010-02-10 03:23:00,854, You suck.  I've had my eye out for a Suveran as a salmon reel for awhile but never ran across any.  Now they're going for $400+ on Ebay.  Damn.
431741,JPD,2010-02-10 03:24:00,296,That reel is kind of like having a tiller and a console in your boat..  looks pretty cool!
431744,Dara,2010-02-10 03:27:00,3052,"Front or rear, you drag should be set before you start fishing."
431747,Syn,2010-02-10 03:43:00,519," Set it, and Forget it!--Ron Popeil Dial-o-matic drag"
431752,fishinguypat,2010-02-10 04:03:00,547,i find that front drag can be a bit smoother and come off more cleanly as some rear drag's have a little more of stop randomly drag's...although a new daiwa rear drag for steelhead and trout has very smooth drag so i don't really know...nuff said
431768,supernaut,2010-02-10 05:35:00,46,"The old black Abu Cardinal C3 is still my favorite reel, I'm still using it today gotta be like over 20 years old. Best drag! Like butter! Abu came out with a rear drag a couple of year ago, nice but not as good as the original.  "
431770,dave524,2010-02-10 10:12:00,4508," Supernaut, that's the last model of the classic Abu Cardinal 3, they were marketed by Zebco for a lot of years before that, in mostly cream and green without the skirted spool. Still got my black Abu Garcias but lost my old Zebco's when my van was broken into  Yeah, they are the ones that converted me to rear drags, best drag on the market at the time, now everyone seem to be saying front drags, what's old become new again."
431890,solopaddler,2010-02-10 18:43:00,8605, Me too. Back in the day I couldn't see beyond the heavier weight and passed them up. I don't think there's been a spinning reel made before or since that's as well made. It's the quality of a rolex watch. Would love to find one myself.    I've got an old Abu Cardinal C3 sitting here at home in pretty much mint shape. Hasn't been used in probably 18 years. Make me an offer and it's yours.
431892,bigfish1965,2010-02-10 18:49:00,3382,"I still have a few Abu Trigger Drag reels. Totally awesome. They came out in the 80's for maybe a year or so. You just grab the trigger and adjust the drag by pressure as you fight the fish. Takes a few times to get the hang of it, but for really big fish, the best system I ever found. It was the best thing for fighting big fish in rivers!"
431920,dave524,2010-02-10 20:31:00,4508,"I always thought that was the main idea of the skirted spool spinning reel when they came out in the 80's, you could use the exposed skirt like the exposed rim of a fly reel like the old Hardy Marquis or like the rim of a float reel with a bit of finger pressure to momentarily increase the drag."
432125,okumasheffield,2010-02-11 03:32:00,318,what about ones like this?  apply your own drag like a centerpin!  http://www.etuoh.com/products/products_sho...0&fmenu=297  wonder why it would never get popular in North America  anyone?
432290,jace,2010-02-11 18:08:00,472,
432291,jace,2010-02-11 18:11:00,472,"  It was to stop the line from getting the big tangles on the shaft under the spool.    funny you don't remember that.  I still have anxiety when i'm using an unskirted spool because it happened so frequently when i was young.  the other reason is improved casting.   without the line whacking away inside the rotor cup, your long distance casts go farther."
432297,canadadude,2010-02-11 18:27:00,769,"when did Daiwa whiskers become rear drag, I' ve been using them for 30 yrs and mine are all front drag. Cardinals were the best rear drag reels made. For me I like the compact design of front drag and it's more convient for me since I've used front drag most of my life. I don't adjust the drag while fighting fish, I've seen way to many fish lost while dudes are screwing with there drag during the fight. #1 tip set your drag when you start fishing and don't worry the rest of the day, do this every time you start because it can be different day in day out!! it only takes a second."
432309,dave524,2010-02-11 18:57:00,4508," The casting thing makes sense, yes had that unfortunate experience with the line as well. My first spinner, an Airex "" Spinster "" and my dad's main reel  a ""Luxor "" both had a fine pipe cleaner like wire that ran in a groove around the bottom of the spool between it and the housing, kept grit and line out.   My mistake, never owned one, just remember the profile from river fishing and all these years thought they were rear drag. Actually considering one as a shore casting reel for trout, am I correct about the reputation as good distance casters at least"
433755,Syn,2010-02-16 04:10:00,519,"Sorry to dig this up but this negative point is very important to future readers.  This applies to the symetre and below rear drags, not the uber tri drag reels.  If you compare the symetre rear vs front drag you'll also notice that since the drag washers are smaller on the rear drag it consequently can only apply a fraction of the max drag of the front drag symetre eg:   http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/gl...symetre_rj.html SY4000RJ Max Drag (lbs) 6  <---rear drag  http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/gl...Symetre_FI.html SY4000FJ   Max Drag (lbs) 15  <---front drag  Same thing with the spirex 9lb rear vs 20lb front drag respectively.   I don't think this would have much effect if using mono or flouro because you are limited by the thickness of the line, but when using say 45lb braid with such a thin diameter, the rear drag model will have a tough time."
433764,CLofchik,2010-02-16 04:39:00,854, For small fish they're fine. As soon as you start targetting fish that are actually going to be pulling drag they blow chunks and will cost you fish eventually.  Then again I say that about front drag Shimano's too
433945,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-16 19:32:00,158,"I'd like to mention back reeling.  I know gusy who swear by it.  I am not a fan, but it works.  what teh point of paying for a nice mooth expensive drag just to crank it down and reel backwards.  Some front drag reel are now doubling up on teh drag washers as well, making them even smooth and more powerful.  Okuma calls it dual force drag, washers in 2 spots esentially.  I have never had a problem adjusting front drag on the fly, but if i do its a minor adjustment as I have my drag set before I start casting."
431405,Syn,2010-02-09 15:44:00,519,"Ok we already know baitcasters are the work of the devil with their rod guides being on top and the majority being right hand retrieve   :lol:    So I won't even go there (except for musky fishing).  Anyhow since I started using rear drag spinning reel, I find them 10X better than front drag reels.  With rear drag I just push a button and the spool pops off so I can switch quickly without having to waste time unscrewing the spool, risk loosing the small washers and cap and having to retighten the drag.  On a rear drag I can quickly adjust (or fine tune) the drag lever depending on how hard the fish is fighting without having to reach in front of the reel and twist the cap which is awkward when fighting a fish.  OK the rear drag reels weight about 1.5 oz more for a 1000 series and 0.5oz more for a 4000 model, but imo the pros outweigh the cons. Yet I've only seen a few rear drag reels."
431407,Roy,2010-02-09 15:50:00,13728,Simply because a rear drag is less efficient.
431410,fish_fishburn,2010-02-09 15:54:00,1311,well Syn I have both but I prefer the front drag way more. It seems alot easier to adjust the drag when fighting a fish with the front drag. I just find the rear drag to complicated in the spur of the moment with the preset drag and drag tension at the back. Just my 2 cents
431411,Spiel,2010-02-09 15:55:00,9065,To the best of my knowledge rear drag designs typically incorporate smaller drag washers thus making them less efficient and less durable than the larger washers of front drag reels.
431415,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-09 16:00:00,2690,"Not as smooth, less efficient...about 25-30 years ago the ""fighting drag"" was a big novelty...turned out the fighting drag pretty much sucked."
431418,pike slayer,2010-02-09 16:12:00,1177,"i think it is alot easier to fine tune your drag when fighting a fish with a rear drag reel. there doesnt seem to be any better quality rear drag reels out there, in shimanos line isnt the spirex the highest quality that comes with a rear drag??? i really think they need to improve it and start doing it to more reels. i only have one rear drag spinning reel and its an old el cheapo shimano."
431419,superdad,2010-02-09 16:20:00,353,"Those classix Abu-Garcia Green and Cream -rear adjusting drags worked like a charm for years and years and years. In my years, the drag has never caused me to lose a fish.  I prefer rear drag, as you adjust on the fly and makeitfor that fish.  Just my .02"
431421,vinnimon,2010-02-09 16:25:00,2593,Now those were nice reels.I beleive some of them are a collectors item.
431422,MJL,2010-02-09 16:28:00,2427,"As others have mentioned, the drag washers on rear drags are smaller than front reel ones.  I actually find front drag reels easier to use and adjust in the heat of the battle.  With all this talk of rear and front drags, whatever happened to the center drags that Abu brought out back in the late 90’s (I think)?  I remember they had one called the Suveran (or something like that and the CD series).  It’s been almost a decade since I bought a 2000 sized spinning and haven’t really been looking in the market to see what's out there.  Back in the day I was seriously thinking of spending my Christmas and Friday's lunch money on a Suveran after watching Italo winch in Kalum river steelhead with one  .  Apparently the drags were even more efficient than front drag reels and the washers had twice the surface area."
431423,LeXXington,2010-02-09 16:29:00,1928,I prefer the rear drag but get a big fish on and I find it slips and you have to adjust.  Could be that its just my cheaper reels but for smaller fish love rear drag systems
431424,Spiel,2010-02-09 16:42:00,9065," Yep, great reels, simple in design and durable. I still have 4 of them that get frequent use but admittedly I have replaced the worn out leather drag washers in all of them, more than once.  They're only true weakness was broken bail springs! Fortunately I still have a couple of sets left.  But hey they still work."
431425,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-09 16:46:00,2690,"Ooops...that was a reel that I forgot about...okay, one exception."
431427,vinnimon,2010-02-09 17:00:00,2593,"out of curiosity, didnt red fisher back in the day swear by them?To this day I cant get my bud to part with his."
431429,bare foot wader,2010-02-09 17:09:00,1354, I bought an abu cd6 and loved it...smooth drag and easy spool removal...used it for everything and it worked flawlessly(until the day i decided to take apart and clean myself and now it sits in a shoebox in about 50 pieces)....I'd still say that a front drag is easier to adjust while fighting a fish but that might be force of habit from years of fishing front drag...
431431,JPD,2010-02-09 17:11:00,296,"As others have mentioned, Drag size is a big factor. Other things to consider is that with rear drags the pressure on the spool shaft is being done from the back of the reel and the shaft is being pulled down as you apply more drag. The is done with the ""t""pin which also allows you to have a quick release spool.  Front drags are direct pressure on the spool from the top and now they almost all have micro adjustment so drag pressure can be finely tuned.  The other major factor which directly affects the weight of the reel is the fact that they can make the reels smaller with front frag since all of the drag components are housed within the spool. On a rear drag model the spool size is the same but just wasted space.  I know that rear drags are far more popular here in Canada than in the US and that's probably the main reason why most manufacturers make so few of them. Shimano has a few models that have them but the highest end one is the Symetre which is the middle of the road reel for their line up. It also still has the fighting drag which I know quite a few people use specifically for fishing jerkbaits. They leave it cranked tight to get a good hook set and then immediately back it off to fight the fish."
431435,bassjnkie,2010-02-09 17:27:00,1101," The center drags disappeared as fast as they came out. I managed to get the Suveran 2000, 3000, 4000 and the cheaper CD6 3000. Now they are in my collector reel collections. They are bullet proof with a wicked drag."
431437,limeyangler,2010-02-09 17:50:00,5204,"    hey Worm Dangler and JP.......Shimano do a lot of rear drag reels....but i dont think they sell them all in Canada?US....i have not seen alot of there rear drag models that i could buy in England....check out the models they sell in Europe   SHIMANO'S EUROPEAN REAR DRAG REEL LINE UP....got my heart set on getting 3 TWINPOWER XT RBs , one for a walleye rod and 2 for trout fishing on ice...  They also do a line of reels called baitcasters...which were primarily designed for carp fishermen....but i found the freespool coupled with rear drag and fighting drag was the perfect pier fishing set up back home when freelining live sandeels for sea bass (stripers). The freespool is also cool to use when lowering your line on downriggers i found out when necessity meant i had to use my XT-RA Baitrunner as it was the only reel i had with a large line capacity. That would be the only drawback with baitrunners for regular fishing....they are big.... the 5000 series being the smallest.  CLICK HERE FOR 'BAITRUNNER' REELS"
431440,cram,2010-02-09 17:57:00,1733,Rear drags are impossible to fine tune (to the level of a front drag) and to me are less durable.
431446,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-09 18:08:00,10439,"  DING, DING, DING, We have a winner!!!!!! The drag surface in a rear drag reel is quite a lot smaller than what you can get in a front drag reel. Thus they are much smoother and don't overheat when fighting big powerful fish."
431448,MJL,2010-02-09 18:13:00,2427," Hey Limey  If in the future you're looking for a smaller baitrunner than the 5000 size, Shimano Europe has 2 new models out that come in 2500 and 4000 sizes.  They are front drag though.  Shimano ST FA  Shimano DL FA  Mike"
431456,limeyangler,2010-02-09 18:30:00,5204,  Good to know Mike...thanks. I actaually have the Aero GTE-B which is quite a few years old now.....was state of the art 6 years ago....lol.
431462,dave524,2010-02-09 18:44:00,4508," To almost the man, steelheaders ran those in the 70's / 80's with the odd Daiwa Whisker Tournament , also a rear drag, thrown in the mix. Now, we never had a drag problem and had fish making longer runs than the head shake or brief spurt of a bass or a walleye that didn't fight like it was on life support. My old Cardinals were Zebcos, I don't think Abu Garcia got rights to the name until they marketed a graphite skirted spool remake with the same rear drag and body housing in the late 80's. Near the end of the Zebco run there was some tannish coloured ones as well. BTW Zebco is really an acronym for the full name of ""Zero Hour Bomb Company""  edit: the Zebcos were made by Abu, kinda strange how Garcia got the bait casters and Zebco marketed the spinners."
431467,Syn,2010-02-09 18:56:00,519,"Worm Dangler: The shimano symetre is also rear drag eg SY2500RJ and an awesome reel. Spirex does not have the infinite antireverse (super stopper II) which is unfortunate.  Spiel ""To the best of my knowledge rear drag designs typically incorporate smaller drag washers thus making them less efficient and less durable than the larger washers of front drag reels.""  Aww that a heartbreaker to learn. No wonder front drag is more popular. Learn something new everyday. Thanks guys.   limeyangler: thanks for the rear drag models link.

431491,Syn,2010-02-09 19:15:00,519, I just watched the Tridrag video VIDEO  It has front and rear drag and looks super smooth. Take that front draggers lol.  You adjust the front drag to the strength of the line then use the rear drags for fish fighting. Freaking awesome. 2nd fishing thing I've learned today.
