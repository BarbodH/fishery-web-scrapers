(still not too sure how I did that)  Let's just say it was the BEST day on the ice that I've had all season!  We landed 15 fish, with 8 fish being 7 lbs or over!! 4 of those being over 10 lbs!!  This was my GF's first time out on the ice, so any fish that she got, would be a new PB for her.  Let's just say that she set 3 PB's in one day! (and yes....got the biggest of the day)  PB #1 - A nice Quinte 5 lb'er   Pb #2 - A beauty Quinte 7 lb'er!   PB #3 - A MONSTER 10.7 lb Walleye!     All in all a great day on the water! If anyone gets the chance...get out there on the Bay of Quinte before the season closes in Feb 28.!   *Stoty"
