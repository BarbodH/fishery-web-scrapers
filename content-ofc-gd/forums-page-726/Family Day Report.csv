It was the first time ice fishing for 2 of them and even though it was a somewhat slow day they are now hooked.  Sobeys had all there fresh food 50% when I went to get sandwiches and I got a little out of hand    We rented a hut from Sherman's out of St. Williams and their service was top notch. Fresh stock of minnows all day, they were constantly checking to make sure we were good and lots of firewood for the fireplace.      We had good action right off the bat and landed a bunch of keepers      I think it was the nicest days that I have ever spent on the ice. We had our jackets off all day and the sun was WARM!!!          We ended up keeping a dozen for a snack and throwing back a ton of smaller ones. Overall a great day on the ice with friends       Dan"

434011,danbouck,2010-02-16 22:43:00,4380," Oh it was   It was great to meet you. If you're ever down this way we should hit the ice or the softwater (as long as you give me back my boat  )   Hey Jim,  It costs $35 per person and parking is $5 at the top of the hill. That gives you the hut, bait, all your holes drilled, firewood and a ride in and out. Shermans and Grangers are both great. Let me know if you want the contact info."
434013,Radnine,2010-02-16 22:52:00,1538, I think that I might have a go at that price. If you could PM me the deatils that would be great Dan. Thanks! Jim
