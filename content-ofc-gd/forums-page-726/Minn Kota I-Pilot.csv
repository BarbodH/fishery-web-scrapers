434148,tschirk,2010-02-17 03:56:00,261,I was all hot to buy one until I found out the connector on my Powerdrive 50 uses the older style flat connector and the iPilot only can connect to the newer round connectors. I don't know the wiring schematic so I'm not sure I could splice something. I'd hate to hack a new piece of gear....
