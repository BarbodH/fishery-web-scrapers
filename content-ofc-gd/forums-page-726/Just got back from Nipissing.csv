Fishing was a bit slow, maybe 20 perch a few whitefish and some mudpups  , but that is how it goes.  We used the day huts twice, from early afternoon until just past dark.  The last day, we were getting some very aggressive strikes but could not seem to land them.  Personally, I think our reaction time was down a bit from all the alcohol   .  The group next to us pulled out some Walleye and a Pike, so they were biting.  As for the operator, Anglers Haven.  They provide phenomenal service to their guests and will go out of their way to make sure you have everything.  Forgot something.....  ask them, they might be able to get it for you.  Out of supplies (smokes, beer)  ask them, and they will ""hook"" you up.  Mark (owner) and Jamie (employee), are both great guys and earned my respect for providing top notch service.  I would, and will go back next year!  Our entire group was already asking me about going there next year.  I can't wait......"
