433165,dheitzner,2010-02-14 13:03:00,314,"Quick report from Mountain Lake in Haliburton: A buddy of mine from work asked if I would join him and his 2 boys for a day of lake trout fishing on Mountain Lake in Haliburton.  Never having fished this waterbody before, I jumped at the chance and by Saturday morning @ 5am we were on the road to Grahams Guiding on Mountain Lake. To make a long story short, Andrew Grahams service was excellent and most importantly, his huts were on fish.  We landed 9 lakers ranging from about 1 to 5lbs and one ling around 5lbs, losing a multitude more. If anyone is looking for a nice change of scenery from Lake Simcoe, Grahams Guiding gets a big recommend from me. (705)935-0003 Darcy   "

433858,johnnyb,2010-02-16 15:13:00,3413,"Very nice, Darcy!  I've only ever heard good things about Grahams...looks like you guys had a great day!"
433901,Carp,2010-02-16 17:16:00,1488,Sounds like a great day for you on the ice. Thanks for sharing.
433916,Great Lake Steel,2010-02-16 18:06:00,41,"Nice report, that's my home lake but I've yet to try hardwater fishing.  Do you mind sharing what you caught them on, and any pictures of the Ling?  I too would be interested in his pricing for a day (as I don't have a shelter). Found his packages on the website for anyone else that's interested: http://www.grahamguiding.com/news.html"
433922,TJQ,2010-02-16 18:34:00,7806,Awesome pictures!!
433928,dheitzner,2010-02-16 18:51:00,314,"Thanks for the replies. All fish but one were caught on minnows, some with a split shot rig and some were drop shotted.  I also caught one on a Williams Dartee.  The fish seemed to be gorging on Smelts, one that we caught just over a pound had 3 big shiners and 2 smelt inside; one smelt was half digested and was over 8"" long! Sure is a nce change from the lack of success (for me this season anyways) on Simcoe. The picture of the ling is on my buddy's camera, I'll post it if he sends it my way. Darcy"
433930,solopaddler,2010-02-16 18:54:00,8605,"Gotta love it, well done! When I was a young kid we had a cottage north of Minden and fished Mountain on occasion. Nice lake."
