The hut is a light blue corrugated aluminum with a darker blue stripe ....wifey painted it so I best not complain about her choice of colour... so if your in the neighbourhood don't forget to knock on the door and say hi!!!!  Suds"
422158,discophish,2010-01-14 03:15:00,392,"New guy in town at the Bait on the Lake.  Young guy.  Seems like a really good guy.  I remember John (I never knew his name), but I remember his wife more because she was always there when we stopped in.  Great lady.  They have a bottle depot out front now to attract more customers.  I hope to stop by again in 2 weeks.  Good luck under the hut Suds!"
422206,camillj,2010-01-14 06:29:00,1988,Wow .. John's been there for years (well if you include his time at Port Carling).. will have to stop in this weekend and meet the new guy hope everything worked out for them (they are great folks for sure !)...
422283,Lunkerhunter,2010-01-14 17:12:00,455,is this one off hwy 141 just past the town of rosseau??  not sure if i have been to bait on the lake.. i always get my minnows on the way up
422333,johnnyb,2010-01-14 20:17:00,3413,"No, this one USED to be right in the town of Port Carling, but is now just a wee bit on the Bala side (south?) of the 118/169 intersection."
422407,Sudsmaster,2010-01-15 00:00:00,29,Bait on the Lake is just south of 118 on hwy 169 in the community of Glen Orchard ....its located right beside the Glen Orchard General Store which backs on to Butterfly Lake...it is also a beer bottle return location ...an interstate battery dealer and BBQ dealer as well ....I drop in there for my licences and bait if I'm over that way and they were always nice people to deal with ...When was it sold?  Suds
422417,johnnyb,2010-01-15 00:25:00,3413,Let's not forget the little shop next door...amazing baked food in there...I like to go get a hot breakfast sandwich after picking up my bait..or a nice burger when coming home...or some pie for later...MMMMMmmmmm
422449,camillj,2010-01-15 01:25:00,1988,"Yes, it is in Glen Orchard ... does anyone know the whole story .. I hope John and his Mrs are ok .. they are great folks."
422455,wee scot,2010-01-15 02:10:00,75,Thats great to hear suds ive been fishing simcoe like crazy while i wait for the freeze up north and ill tell you the fishing on simcoe this year is hot some masive lakeers coming through the ice still not the same as the peace and tranquility of the northern lakes cant wait keep us posted suds
422489,discophish,2010-01-15 02:58:00,392,"Hmm, unfortunately I didn't stick around to chat long enough to get the whole scoop on the story.  All I know is that he has big plans to reinvent the design of the store, and bringing in more retail merchandise, and has started the bottle depot to attract more interest.  Yeah!  We ordered a roast beef sandwich on toasted ciabatta bread!  It was like putting the best day of my life into my mouth ... okay, I got that from the beer commercial.  Mmmm."
422573,johnnyb,2010-01-15 13:59:00,3413,"Hey...I might have a shot at Rosseau this Sunday...any word on the main lake?  ie..if I want to walk out of Windermere Bay into some deeper water?  Still dicey or are people crossing it?  LMAO at the sandwich review, Disco!"
422785,Sudsmaster,2010-01-16 00:30:00,29,"I haven't seen anyone head towards the island other than the two airboats that are running around but yesterday I did see a hut being pulled by an ATV go over to the point directly south of the Windermere House where the 80' plus water is ....I was extremely nervous for them as that ice was only a week old and it's not like we are setting all time lows right now!!!! They just cut it in and left and I never got a chance to talk to them ...I'm sitting on just over 7"" right now but I'm only out 150 yds in 62' of water.  I'll be out there for a bit tomorrow and hopefully sometime Sunday but we have company for the weekend and lets just say they are land lovers. LOL  Suds"
422988,johnnyb,2010-01-16 15:41:00,3413,"Airboats only eh...?  Allright...well I don't feel TOO bad about being stuck down here then...have a good weekend Sudsy   Will check in with you soon...looks like the last weekend of the month I will be in Muskoka at a friend's place on Lake Muskoka.  If we don't do terribly well in front of his place, I think I'll be able to drag him over the the spots I know on Rosseau.  Still waiting to hear what and if you're catching anything in that hut of yours with the lovely blue paint on it"
423670,Sudsmaster,2010-01-18 22:33:00,29,Well I fished all day Thurs with a buddy from down south and we caught 10 fish with the best 4 trout being over 4lbs each ...unfortunately had company all weekend and didn't get back out till this afternoon for four hours ...again I caught 10 + fish but they were all about 1.5 lbs of less so they all got to swim ....the ice is doing well and there are now a few more machines running around ...I myself am still waddling out until we get back into true winter weather.  Suds
423688,johnnyb,2010-01-18 23:05:00,3413,Nice shootin!!! I heard that Rosseau was producing quite a few fish over the weekend...nice to hear.  Better to see first hand though!! Couple more weeks...hope I can last that long!
423809,camillj,2010-01-19 09:20:00,1988,"12"" of Black ice on Rosseau near Ferndale Rd. ... The guy beside me went 20 for 30 (or so it seemed) ... we went 1 for 3 ... our minners were bigger"
428060,john117,2010-01-31 22:45:00,17,i was wondering if anyone  is catching anything at the sands in gravenhurst?
428470,Sudzy,2010-02-01 22:05:00,88,"Any updates on the ice on Rosseau??  I am a complete newbie to the area, and Ice fishing as well.  Have a place up there somewhat close to windemere. Is that the spot to go to?  Can you rent huts or is it better to just go out on the ice?"
428540,gravyriggin',2010-02-02 00:53:00,10,"Hey Boys,  Not sure about the ice on Rosseau, or whether people have been nailing Lakers out by the Sands, but the ice at the north end of Muskoka near the Indian River is between 5-6 inches of solid black ice as of Saturday, January 30th. Couple of Lakers poked by to lay down on some ice for us. Biggest was around 4 lbs.  Let me know about Rosseau and the Sands. GR"
428541,discophish,2010-02-02 01:00:00,392,"I don't think I can ever recall seeing a hut operator out by Windermere, but I could be wrong.  Windermere should be good to go, it was a while ago.  We just got back from fishing the weekend on Rosseau in Port Carling and the ice was about 14 inches thick.  It stormed all day yesterday in the area, and we trapped ourselves in a snow squall when it started getting dark and ready to leave.  We had to stay last night because I couldn't even see the road a foot ahead while driving.  Terrible conditions.  Lots of snow on the lake now.  The fishing has been great.  Lots of people having good success."
430076,spadabear,2010-02-06 02:25:00,3," The sandwiches are beyond excellent! The guy running Bait on the Lake (Captain John) was really good to us. He seems to know his stuff and the lake very well. I believe it was the July issue of Fishing Ontario (might have been a different magazine, but that's what is coming to mind atm) that he was on the cover of last year with one heck of a big laker. Definetly worth stopping in to talk with, and swing by the store next door while you are there for some great home baked goodies or some sandwiches to help tide you over while you are out on the ice!"
430582,Sudsmaster,2010-02-07 15:45:00,29,There was someone with huts out there last yr with signs on them for rent ( I have no idea who it was just a laminated sheet stuck on the hut with a contact number) but I haven't seen them this yr... Birchdale Cottages rent a few huts on Three Mile Lake if you are looking for perch or walleye.  Lots of ice in Windermere ...fishing is good...quantity not an issue although size so far had left a little bit to be desired ...   Suds
430671,Sudzy,2010-02-07 19:00:00,88,Thanks Suds.  How far away is 3 mile from Port Carling? Know any other spots for perch in the area?
431017,Sudsmaster,2010-02-08 16:34:00,29,Three Mile lake is just up the road from Windermere ...oh I'd say 5 kms ....if you want some idea just look up google map ...less than a five minute drive from my house to this end of the lake ...From Port Carling I would have to say 20-25 minutes max....oh maybe add 5 min for deer dodging as they are really active along Brackenrig Road....as for perch I really can't help you there as it has never been a fish I really targeted ...usually only just went down to the lake and let the kids have fun with them.  Suds
434122,Sudzy,2010-02-17 02:59:00,88,"Was on Rousseau this past week, got on to some good lakers, nothing huge but decent amount. Props to Captain John for the hut rental, it was a good time."
415590,wee scot,2009-12-27 00:38:00,75,Hey guys its the wee scot again just wondering if anyone has an update on ice conditions up north d day is getting close for the lakers
416778,Sudsmaster,2009-12-30 15:45:00,29,I went down to Lake Rosseau here in Windermere yesterday ...bad news is the lake is wide open from the docks right over to the island ...winds broke out all the ice that we had last Tues and it has been quite windy ever since ...I am going to take the camera down a little later today and post a pic once I return.  Suds
417110,wee scot,2009-12-31 13:15:00,75,Thanks for the update suds was hoping to hit windermere on saturday morning to try for a laker there were only four inches on her last year off the dock t6hat was on the 2nd of january  fingers crossed for d day thanks again suds look forward to hearing back from you the wee scot
417182,Sudsmaster,2009-12-31 16:38:00,29,Well I just got back from the Windermere Wharf (Lake Rosseau) ....there is no ice ....docks are iced in but other than that the water is wide open as far as you can see in all three directions ...Damned winds....Portage Bay is closed up but no idea as to the thickness and it doesn't appear to had any walkers/sledders on it just a few deer tracks...Three mile Lake is closed up and snowmobiles are now crossing the lake ...there is one hut out about 100 yds from Northland Recreation's loading ramp ....the usual earlybird at Wonder Beach still has his hut on shore ....I didn't take a walk with the chisel so I can't tell you anything about the quality or thickness of the ice ...its going to be few weeks yet before Windermere will be ready to go ....that deepest dock is starting to look like a good spot ..LOL  Suds
417195,discophish,2009-12-31 17:08:00,392,"Deer tracks on Portage Bay?  That gives me a good idea to help conceal the good fishing spots so that people don't follow my footprints.  Wear deer shoes when I walk out on the lakes.  Thank you for scouting things out.  Knowing where not to go is definitely helpful.  The way things are going, the 2 big lakes will end up having the same feb 14 opener."
417863,johnnyb,2010-01-02 14:25:00,3413,I made it out on 3 mile for a bit...in the shallow end by Dee Bank...too bad about Windermere...although it sure would be nice if Rosseau froze up without any snow on it...makes walking a heck of a lot easier.
417977,wee scot,2010-01-02 22:57:00,75,Hey johny got out on portage bay today 6inches of ice all over no fish though never even marked one was nice to be out temp was minus 22 when we arived at lake should help the ice to form .
418622,johnnyb,2010-01-04 21:32:00,3413,Well at least you got out...hopefully this cold snap does the trick!
418714,Sudsmaster,2010-01-05 01:32:00,29,I went down to the wharf on Sunday afternoon ...ice had built its way out about 100 yds ...but the damned winds were just pounding it ...I'll go down tomorrow and see if it has improved at all ....there wasn't alot of steam rising off of it so it must be ready to start to harden up .....Hell even Simcoe is ahead of us this yr .....  Suds
418810,Lunkerhunter,2010-01-05 14:02:00,455,"3 mile has 4-6 inches anywhere i checked.... the guy who put the hut out across from northland brought it back in the next day.  many sleds crossing the lake and even many right out in the middle.  alot of the ice i checked had alot of slush with it, not much clear black ice."
418813,youngvedder,2010-01-05 14:16:00,72,"i was on Medora lake and surrounding area and had 5-6 inches on the lake, edges were still a bit slushy. with the -22 degree temps over the weekend and continuing this week, im sure it will continue to improve...  cheers,  Yv"
419026,john117,2010-01-06 01:00:00,17,i was wondering if the small lakes are safe to go on in muskoka? because i am iching to go out
419195,johnnyb,2010-01-06 15:43:00,3413,"Welcome aboard, Big Fisher.  I would be careful on any lake you head out to right now...although lots of small ones seem to be getting better and better.  You're PROBABLY safe to walk on most of the ""small lakes""...but be smart."
419212,The Birdfish,2010-01-06 17:03:00,73,"Just got back from my lake 20 mins south of the sound, ice was good aleast 5 inches, good for walking fore sure!!!!"
419607,Sudsmaster,2010-01-07 16:15:00,29,Was down to the wharf in Windermere late yesterday afternoon ....still no real gains on the ice ...wind is continually breaking out any ice gains we have made with the recent cold snap ....I'm going to go down again this afternoon and hopefully snap a pic for all to see ....that is unless I get really depressed and break down and head over to Three Mile for perch ...urgggggggg  Suds
419619,johnnyb,2010-01-07 17:01:00,3413,OOOoohhhh....that is some SERIOUS depression right there...I hope it doesn't come to that    I'm thinking that after this warm spell is up...the winds will die down and the big lake should tighten up nicely.  I know that people are on Muskoka...???  Or there's that shallow bay on Rosseau off the Brackenrig road...maybe that's firmed up enough?
419636,john117,2010-01-07 18:19:00,17,hey guy's i just got an update on the ice conditions on lake muskoka and the bait shop guy tould me that the fire collage in gravenhurst has about 8 to 10  and a cupple huts and that most small bays should be safe to go on lake muskoka .
420165,Sudsmaster,2010-01-08 22:32:00,29,Just got back from the Windermere Wharf ....the bay is finally iced in as far as I could see with my telephoto lens on my camera ...there was someone straight out from the pier fishing today (walkers) but unfortunately they were gone before I got down there today.  I didn't have my float suit or spud and had my 2.5 yr old grandson with me so I was unable to venture out myself to check the thickness ...hopefully either tomorrow or Sun I will finally be able to play with some trout ...I have a few pics that I will post a little later once I get them on my photo hosting site.

420445,johnnyb,2010-01-09 20:17:00,3413,WOOHOOO!!!! That's some fanTASTic news...thanks for the updat Sudsy!!
420521,john117,2010-01-10 01:00:00,17,heyguys bigfisher here  how the fishing doing? this question is off topic but i was out fishing and i cot a ling i was always  tould that  ling was bad to eat so i threw it back down the hole. why are they bad to eat?
420567,steverowbotham,2010-01-10 02:42:00,1800,"they're not, they're delicious"
420612,Sudsmaster,2010-01-10 04:27:00,29,Well if you can get past their looks they are actually quite good to eat ....some people call them poor man's lobster or fresh water cod ...I found that if you boiled fillet chunks in salt water they actually have a lobster like taste ...just add garlic butter and you are good to go...last year we seemed to be catching a look more than the previous 5yrs on Rosseau and if you have multiple lines down they have a tendency to get them well tangled as they kinda ball up on the retrieve.  Suds
421384,Sudsmaster,2010-01-12 00:47:00,29,"Huts have found there way to the ice in Windermere ...down there today and there was a 8x8 planted on the ice and a smaller one on the wharf waiting to be put out ....checked all my stuff and my hut may just be heading down there sometime tomorrow ......they walked the hut out but I will be checking first and if the ice is better than 6"" everywhere I check the machine will be pulling mine out ....

421439,discophish,2010-01-12 02:31:00,392,"We were fishing around Port Carling this past weekend.  About 9 inches where we were, but still weak is some areas..  Only 1 permanent hut, but lots of us in portables.  Drop in at the local bait shop ""Bait On The Lake"".  He just bought the place and getting himself established.  Great guy, and super friendly.  He will give you the details if you show him that you are a nice person too!  Be very careful out there."
