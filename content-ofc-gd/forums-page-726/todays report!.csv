433612,Dara,2010-02-15 23:34:00,3052,  I warped both primary clutch sheaves and siezed my drive chain...you gotta change the oil in the gear case once in a while.
433617,redneck666,2010-02-15 23:40:00,563,"well.... thats a givin, hahaha. lucky for me i dont have to worry about chain case oil right now  just a barring"
433625,archie_james_c,2010-02-15 23:51:00,618,      Getting lazy nowdays are we Dara?
433645,Dara,2010-02-16 00:20:00,3052,"  I never realized that I should be changing gear case oil. The book said I should but I didn't realize it breaks down like that. I guess you could call it lazy. Blowing the idler bearings on the trail was because I was too lazy to loosen the track to check them in my shop this fall. I likely would have caught it then. The clutch was from over heating it..too fast for too long. I have been blowing belts and working towards the solution.  Live and learn...9,000 miles on it...gotta expect a bit to wear out. Its for sale next year if you know anybody interested"

433542,trevy727,2010-02-15 21:39:00,351,your post says caught 8 lakers between you and a buddy. just thought i'd let you know that's more than your limit. and it's not a slot size. only 1 fish greater than 15.7inches
433544,pike slayer,2010-02-15 21:43:00,1177,"ya 8 were caught and 4 were tossed back down the hole, nice and healthy good to be caught another day tdunn my buddies were nailing lakers all morning and early afternoon till they left with their limit in nice sized lakers, but they didnt go for specks!"

433552,pike slayer,2010-02-15 21:54:00,1177,what trevy for keeping 4 last year when the limit was 3???
433554,trevy727,2010-02-15 21:59:00,351,  i only keep about a dozen fish all year and they're all walleyes. i just assumed the limit was 4 last year because that's what you claimed you kept.
