Some info on the rods (left to right): All the rods are telescopic, there are no elastics within them, the first two rods are from Shimano and the third one is from Guangwei.  First rod is 5.4m when fully extended, 1m contracted, 6 segments and is carp super-hard grade (stiffness of rod).  Second rod is also 5.4 m fully extended, 1m contracted, 6 segments and this one is carp & herabuna (Japanese goldfish) super-hard grade.  The last rod is 4.48m fully extended, 60cm contracted, 9 segments,for all purpose fresh water lake fishing, and is graded hard.  If you are interested in Asian rods, I suggest watching these videos of the rods in action http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHBiF1R8q8g...feature=channel   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPUsvV_6J6E...feature=channel"

433970,sunfishangler,2010-02-16 20:32:00,9,"Actually I bought these over there during winter break. But yes, I can get them from a relative. I personally haven't seen Asian whips in the GTA, but I think there is one shop that might try to bring them in. I have seen/purchased Jaxon whips from Fishing Sport when they were still here, but personally European whips in my opinion are nothing like Asian whips in terms of having easy transportation, light weight and the strength of hauling in a carp all-in-one. The price of the first one is about $198, the second one is about $135 and the third one is about $100."
433976,bassjnkie,2010-02-16 20:49:00,1101,"Bronte Tackle carries the Korean whips, there really nice, but not the same quality as the 3 you got. Bet you can't wait to test them out."
434127,sunfishangler,2010-02-17 03:10:00,9,  Did you know that in Korea they use whips for ice fishing?
434133,hammercarp,2010-02-17 03:28:00,964,Ya I saw pictures of it. The guy had about ten rods out. He had them arranged like a fan with the holes drilled in a semi-circle . He sat at the centre and could easily reach each rod.
