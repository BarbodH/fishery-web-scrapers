I managed one Large Mouth Bass that went about 1 lb...????"

603910,radar,2011-07-18 14:04:00,138,Awesome. Wish my grandad took me for carp like that! Did you have to blur the face of the second pic to protect its identity? I've seen backgrounds blurred but I think this getting a little carried away. 
603923,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-18 14:57:00,2690,"Great stuff!!!  Keep ""passing it on""!!!!!!"
604110,Colin Marshall,2011-07-18 22:16:00,66," Hey Radar,  It was an awesome day and great to see my grandson catch fish however big or small, it always gives me so much pleasure to see him catch stuff and I can tell you he was pretty chuffed....  The blurred out face was actually at the request of the Carp...., he was obviously very embarrassed at getting caught....lol....."

604884,Colin Marshall,2011-07-20 21:43:00,66," Hi Eddie,  I first took my grandson fishing when he was 2 years old, then unfortunately they moved away, he is now 11 and I certainly have missed out on a lot of years with him. Now we have moved here to Canada and sure as hell I mean to play catch up.  Can't wait for the next session, you never know I might even give him a run for his money...."
