I figure I can hit 2-4 lakes over the weekend.  Any recommendations?.... Three Mile? Skeleton? Rouseau? Mary Lake? Young lake"
604822,johnnyb,2011-07-20 18:43:00,3413,"You've got very small and very large lakes listed there....what kind of boat do you have?  Pretty sure you have a place on 3 Mile, from your posts earlier in the season....largies were super aggressive in the shallow weeds last weekend.... Rosseau can be great for lakers if you can get down to 40-50 feet....also great smallie fishing on typical stucture....rocky points, steep drops, etc    "
604829,cityfisher,2011-07-20 19:04:00,959, yup have a place near 3 mile but never checked out the other area lakes. I actually never been on any of the area lakes since getting my place... Just messing around on the property with the atv !  I got a 18 foot Sea Ray Bowrider....Not exactly great for shallow bass fishing as it doesnt have a trolling motor.
604832,johnnyb,2011-07-20 19:11:00,3413,"Yep...you will be getting choked up with weeds pretty good....not too bad if you can drift along a weedline and use a paddle....but that's a big boat to paddle, and I think you'd end up buried in the weeds with them wrapped around the prop and lots of frustration.  I marked a ton of stuff down at 20' trolling through Hammell's bay....but I think I should have been drifting, as I couldn't get bottom bouncers down too far....little 8hp just won't idle slow. I've heard good things about smallmouth on Skeleton....but I've also heard people striking out big time.  I don't know much about Mary...but the pike and bass on Vernon are supposed to be pretty good. As for Young...used to be a nice quiet spot for skinnydipping....but it's a bit busier now....best if you keep the swimtrunks on.  Tough to get anything more than 8-10inch smallies from shore there.  Your boat will get down the hill no problem...but might not float once it gets to the water...and certainly won't be coming back up the hill"
604834,cityfisher,2011-07-20 19:15:00,959,"Yeah, i ussually fish with my bro and couple buddies with proper fishing boats... My boat is comfy but can be a pain in the Butt ! Thanks for the tips! ill give it a goo and hopefully have something to report"
604835,johnnyb,2011-07-20 19:16:00,3413,Good luck...looking forward to hearing how you made out
