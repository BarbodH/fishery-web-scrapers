603581,beginner,2011-07-17 16:29:00,542,nice bass..
603583,ChrisK,2011-07-17 16:34:00,2772,Nice bass !! I'm just ball parking it....If the fish was a football I'd put it at about 5 lbs but on average I'd say 3 to 4 lbs.
603590,Terry,2011-07-17 16:42:00,14456,"close to 4 lbs, real good fish   you don't sell electronic on eBay, do you.....you don't have to answer if you don't want to"
603754,singingdog,2011-07-18 00:25:00,1047,"My guess on that fish would be around 5. I don't worry much about weight, but do measure length of large fish. Length tell you how big a fish is, weight tells you how well it's been eating"
