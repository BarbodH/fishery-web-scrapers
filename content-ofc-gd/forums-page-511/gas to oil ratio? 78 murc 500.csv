604946,Fish Farmer,2011-07-21 01:08:00,2234,"Id say 50-1 also, I know when I had my 1961 10HP Evinrude they didn't have 50 to 1 oil, we used 1 Quart of 30 sae regular to 5 GALLONS of gas."

604956,GBW,2011-07-21 01:37:00,8460,"if you can, find out the brand of oil the last owner used.  you might not want to start running AMS-OIL Synthetic in it if it's never had it run through it before.  If you cannot find out, run the good old style stuff you can get at CTC as that's what was more then likely used in the past.  Just my extra  to the reply..."
604962,tightline,2011-07-21 01:43:00,322,definetley 50:1 my buddy has 2 and we run it all the time

605001,Uncle Buck,2011-07-21 04:06:00,1000,i always run my older motors at 45:1... a little extra just to be safe... cheaper then changing engines...
605027,Billy Bob,2011-07-21 11:54:00,5865,I bought a new 1975 7.5 hp Mercury back in 1975 and it was 50:1 on the oil. And no it's not what kind of oil you use but what the manufacture recommends that determines the ratio.  Bob
