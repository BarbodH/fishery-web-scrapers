So if you were to hire me for one of these fish...  How many would satisfy you?  And how many to get you to come back?""  This is the question asked. I think Mike has done the research, and knows what is necessary to become a guide. He just needs to know if he has the 'Numbers' to be successful at it. I think most of us have a driving desire to be helpful when asked, that is the reason for all of the advice given Mike. We would all like you to be successful."
604610,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-20 03:02:00,4399,  Congratulation you passed the audition you are now a guide!!!
604620,Henricus,2011-07-20 03:16:00,118,"Limit walleye, at least 1 muskie in the boat and a follow or two.  Since everybody seems to think you want their opinion, I will join the party and add mine as well.  I am never one for reinventing the wheel.  My guess is you will find your answer much quicker if you actually phoned a few guides working different waters than you plan to work.  According to this thread all guides are virtual Dale Carnegie's and would tell you exactly what you want to know.  Good luck Rick"
604630,Roy,2011-07-20 04:00:00,13728,"And here's my honest answer...  Im wondering what kinda fishing you expect when you hire a guide... When I hire a guide, I don't expect the fishing to change. Alone or with a guide the fishing will be the same. The experience will be different.  How many fish does it take to keep you happy... I really don't think that folks' degree of happiness is measured in numbers of fish.  I'm asking this because I'm gunna be getting into guiding and I wanna know how close I am to being good enough... The numbers of fish the YOU have caught have no bearing on how good a guide you are. Prospective clients probably don't care how many fish YOU caught.  So basically... My walleye average size is about 3 pounds Prospective out of town clients don't know what the average walleye weighs in Lake St Francis so it's irrelevant.  And musky average is 38-40 inches I believe the smallest legal fish in your zone is 48""  And carp average is 17-20 pounds I don't know about carp but you probably won't need a Ranger to catch them.  So if you were to hire me for one of these fish...  How many would satisfy you? Again, it really has nothing to do with numbers of fish.  And how many to get you to come back? If you were a real loudmouthed butthole but you managed to get a client a limit of really nice walleye...do you think he'd book with you again? No, I don't think so  Mike, I'm being honest here. You may very well be an excellent guide but you'll never succeed by simply saying what you've caught. Take some folks fishing....put THEM onto fish and catching a fish then passing the rod off to a client might be a little dicey to a CO.  Take a run at it Mike and good luck to you."
604674,Harrison,2011-07-20 12:25:00,2202,"Talk about some amazing advice in this thread.  I wish I had some of this guidance when I started my guide business.  Instead I learnt the hard way through trail and error.  Mike, here is the down and dirty.  Plain and simple....  There are a handful of guys I know who are true ""Pros"".  Sure they can catch fish, but more important, they make you feel like an ole fish'n buddy after the day is done.  That was always my goal guiding and itmade us quite successful. Basing this whole business venture on average fish boated is very very bad business.  So, if you are prepared to invest thousands before seeing a return, have taken small business courses, ready to take all the courses and get your proper/required licenses, have 5 or 6 back up plans for each body of water to guarantee fish, diverse quality gear and have above average people skills, give it go.  But to be honest, really research the COSTS.  It will open your eyes.  I guarantee it.  Not trying to discourage, just sharing my experienced viewpoint."
604693,mike rousseau,2011-07-20 13:13:00,4661,Thnx guys...  And I don't see why a CO would care if I pass off my rod... Great lakes trollers count themselves and pass off their rods...  At least my guide did
604747,Moosebunk,2011-07-20 15:17:00,3970, What Bill said...... plus a trophy EVERY time. lol.
604838,fishermccann,2011-07-20 19:28:00,655,"Are there not different rules on the GreatLakes. And yes they are breaking the rules when they ""party"" fish."
604842,Terry,2011-07-20 19:40:00,14456, there is no law against passing a rod...however the fish caught becomes part of both peoples daily limit
604844,OutdoorDan,2011-07-20 19:48:00,325, Well the fact that you are asking this illustrates that you are missing an important point a lot of people are mentioning. You must have good people skills and be able to implicitly understand what people need. Asking about averages any expectations is useless because there is so much variability. If you took me out and we got skunked I would still be happy if you showed me some new and useful techniques. However many people only fish a couple of times a year and just want to get into fish and don't care for learning techniques because they won't be using the knowledge. Correctly judging who falls into which category is where your people skills come in.
604852,ehg,2011-07-20 20:05:00,2666,"Your best bet is probably to go out with a guide in the area and observe how they go about things. Marc Thorpe is one of the best guides in that area and obviously knows the best. The best fishermen in the world hire him. Check out the ""Next Bite"" link you provided. I remember years ago he posted a report where he caught 58"" and 57"" muskies up that way guiding Aaron Shirley. Mike Lazarus is another one that comes to mind. Might be good to learn smallmouth fishing. Think that Lake St. Francis holds the record for Canadian tournament weigh in for a bass tournament. Good luck with this undertaking anyways."

Limit of walleyes I guess if I was after meat....but for me just a consistant day, maybe a new technique and a trophy never hurts...I don't musky fish so I would be happy with just 1 or 2 hookups.  Good luck dude, guiding CAN be a blast!   TDunn"
605028,Roy,2011-07-21 11:54:00,13728,"Was looking at the business/legal side of guiding on St. Francis and this is what you'll need. 1) SVOP 2)Med A3 3) First aid 4) VHF license 5) 1 million insurance per person in the boat (Commercial insurance)  I hope it's not too discouraging but you really have to cover your butt with everything you do nowadays. Provincial police and MNR are mandated to enforce these things and it can be financially crippling to be found at fault. Do your homework, get into guiding slow and steady as a profession and you'll do fine."
605029,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 12:02:00,4661,Thnx Roy... I've been talking to a friend who is a local guide and he wants to partner up and he's has all the requirements and knows where and how I can get it done...

604503,TDunn,2011-07-19 22:19:00,680,"It is a tough gig dude! Networking has been key for me so far and personality is a huge factor. I'm no full time guide but I do it with my time off from work and so far I've really enjoyed it. There is just something about watching a client reel in a fish with that ""look"" on thier face.  As far as expectations go.....well I have had guys expecting 40""+ pike all day just because they were going to be in Canada. I explained over the phone before they even came up that they might have to drive another 20-30 hours north to find fishing like that. After I explained where we were going and what I expected from the day. They had no problems and booked with me.....Don`t Bull them on sizes but stay confident with your abilities to produce.  Promotion is huge.....thats all Im going to say about that...Get your name out there. Get to know the different birds and animals of the area, historic events that have happened....just stuff that can keep conversation and interest flowing throughout the day.  Oh, and I don`t usually fish with guests unless we are really struggling for fish or they just simply want me too.  Make the trip special for them. Same as you would want if you hired a guide.  Good luck man,  TDunn"
604509,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-19 22:49:00,4399,  Just curious Tyler does your part time guiding require you to be licensed and or insured?

604517,TDunn,2011-07-19 23:10:00,680, I don't guide from a boat. Ive only done a couple trips from a boat All my guiding is done on the river banks or on the ice. This might be some interest to you muskymike. OSGA   I make my clients sign a waiver.....Im not responsible for injury/lost or stolen goods....all that fun stuff....but if I was guiding out of a boat I would have full coverage no doubt about it!   edit- mike remember to get a business ###....gotta register with the government forsure!
604518,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:14:00,26272," I'll second that.. 8 days with Thorpe and I convinced him to make a total of 3 casts while we ate our lunches and that took a lot of demanding that he do so on my part. And the one year we were on a weed bed that put many MANY +48"" fish in the boat a couple of those days. We made the Mania ""Best Days"" video look tame....   and he still wouldn't pick up a rod no matter how much I tried to get him to do so.  The secret of guiding is you need to love the thrill of the hunt, the skill required to be successful and seeing other people happy to boat some of their best fish of their lives. Willing to share tips and tricks and also the unfortunate side of needing to be able to put up with some real   while still smiling."

I know you need to be a nice guy I know you need insurance  I just wanna know  If I guide 2 customers for walleye... 2-5lbs... How many fish would you expect to get ...  If I took 2 people for musky... How many do I have to boat? 38-40 inch average ...?

I have been on a BOQ guided charter previously and have two more planned for this late fall. First is a single day with three other fisherman. For this trip, I would expect that we all finish the day  with  2-3 regulation keepers each. My second trip is a two day/two night solo trip. I have planned with the guide to cull and limit out on day one. Day two will strictly be a 'trophy hunt' targeting a new PB's, strictly catch and release. For the two day booking, I expect the guide to educate and allow me to participate in lure/location selection and be actively involved in rigging. Sharing a scotch and cigar would be a bonus. Hope this helps.  Slayer"

604579,danc,2011-07-20 01:20:00,4677,"I used to have a web site about my Brook Trout fishing. I did it just for fun because I liked computers and I liked Brook Trout fishing, and in fact my site became #1 on pretty much every search engine at one time if you searched ""Brook Trout"". I didn't offer any guiding on my site but the offers came all the time. I never took one client out because my fishing locations were sacred to me. I could have had $500.00+ days and $1500.00+ weekends, but it wasn't worth it to me. I'd simply be selling my locations. I have seen a few people guiding near where I fish and I have seen those clients back fishing on their own several times. Fortunately the guide that took them out didn't have a clue what he was doing, despite the $1000.00 contract that was sitting on the seat of his vehicle in plain view, and the client never caught a fish with the guide or when he returned on his own. My situation is unique I suppose. I fish what is arguably the best drive to Brook Trout fishing on the planet. Will I sell my spots to a stranger for $1000.00? No. But I'll take a friend for free."

604458,Big Cliff,2011-07-19 19:57:00,6899,"I have used guides a few times! It has never been about how many or how big for me, I just enjoy the opportunity to get out fishing some new waters or species with someone that does their best to make it as good a day as they can. For me, it is all about the experience! As for how much? It is really hard to put a value on something like that. I think it all depends on what is supplied.  When I was much younger I use to guide in the French River mostly for American tourists. I always tried my very best to put them on fish and teach them what to use and how to use it. I always tried to make sure they had a good experience without leaving them exhausted at the end of the day. If it was hot or cold I took things like that into consideration. Hot tea, coffee, or hot chocolat on the cold days, plenty of cold drinks on the hot ones. I tried to plan shore lunches that would satisify all in the party and always tried to insure that there were no special needs (diabetic, food alergies, whatever).  I made sure that the boats were always spotless and in good condition, was always ready to go at least 15 minutes before we were to leave so they didn't end up standing around waiting and wondering what was going on and tried to insure I was prepaired for the unexpected, first aid kit, toilet paper, plenty of bait. I always made sure their catch was well taken care of (packed on ice) and cleaned and taken to their cottage shortly after we returned from the day out.  I guess it worked because many of them would ask for me by name and actually book me when they booked their trips. I also made some awsome tips, sometimes my tips were more than the lodge charged them for the service for the day.  Did we always catch our limits? No, but when we didn't no one else was either but for the most part we did as well as or better than most and I would always help anyone that asked.  In fact, that is how I met Rick, he was fishing up there one spring, I was acting as a guide for 3 fellows, we kept coming in with nice stringers, no one else was catching much, I quite happily told him where we were fishing and what we were using and how. Never realized we'd both meet up here on OFC one day LOL.  Good luck with your new venture, best advice I can give you is do your best to make sure that you give your customers, above average service. Think that if you were the customer, how would you like to be treated, and base your price on providing good value for the price you charge."

604469,aplumma,2011-07-19 20:21:00,6896,"Have you found out legally what you need to be a guide? What licenses are required? What medical training do you have to have? What equipment is needed to comply as a boat for hire? Is a Captains license required for the area you fish? Cover all of these bases before you decide to be a Guide. I would also price out what it cost per trip including all of the insurance , advertising, give aways and expendables like bait and tackle that you will replace on a time bases. I am not trying to talk you out of it but go into this with a budget and plan to cover slow times and down times when you can't be on the water. I did the math and found I would be better off working for $15.00 an hour ( that was with a $1.00 per hour profit after expenses) for a large guiding company than going at it as a single guiding service... the overhead was just to much to make a year round living with a 8 month fishing season down South.

604487,mercman,2011-07-19 20:54:00,7054,"Mike, i think the more experienced members here are just letting you know some of the things you should be aware of if you are serious about starting a guide service. Things like insurance, and such. Especially liability insurance if someone gets hurt while in your care. I think if anyone can make a go of it in your area, you can. Just be sure you look at all the possibilities first. And to show faith, i will be your first customer.  A full report will be posted here next Saturday night."

604493,craigdritchie,2011-07-19 21:12:00,1586,"I've fished with a LOT of guides, and all around the world. One thing I can't emphasize enough is how important it is for the guide to have extraordinary people skills. Every customer will show up with different expectations, and the challenge for the guide is to figure out what those expectations really are (often completely different from what the customer tells you) and then do whatever you can to meet them.  Some of your customers will arrive with expectations that are completely unrealistic, and you need to deal with that too. You will meet people who will be disappointed that they didn't catch a half-dozen 50-inch muskies in an afternoon. You will meet people who say they are lifelong fishermen, then they break your gear or don't know how to cast. You will have customers from ""out of town"" who steal your spots, and and from that moment on you see them out there every weekend in their own boat pounding the spots you showed them. Some of them may even wind up advertising as guides and competing against you! Get used to it, because that's going to be part of your everyday reality.  Most customers, however, will be just fine. I've always enjoyed when the guide could tell me all about the area we're fishing in, the history of the place, unique stuff about it, that sort of thing. For example, a guy on the St. Lawrence could talk about the history of the place as a muskie fishery, with all the world records that came from there, the way that fishery is different from others, how things like the Seaway and exotic species have affected it, etc etc. Make it more than a day on the water - make it an experience.  It goes without saying - many customers will show up unprepared, so you better make sure you have extra rain suits, sunscreen, hats, bug spray, snacks and drinks in the boat.  Oh yes - guides in your area may fish while they guide, but no one will pay money to watch the guide have all the fun. Your job is to put customers on fish so that they can catch them, and to do that properly, you'll need to stow your own rod."
604494,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-19 21:27:00,0,"it may sound strange but ""catching fish"" might be the least important part of guiding.  if you are a good angler, the fish will come.  hell, this forum is FULL of solid anglers that can consistently catch fish.  the people skills, the business savvy, knowing the legal/insurance obligations, etc are all just if not more important."
604502,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-19 22:15:00,4399,"  Your either a guide or your not, not trying to be difficult but if you hire out your boat and services to the public then I am sure there are numerous legalities involved. I don`t think legally you just say okay I am a guide today lets see how it goes. I am thinking liability insurance would be very expensive."
