Albion Hills is pretty much useless from what I understand.  And I suppose the Credit could be nice.  But what about any hidden gems that people are willing to share?  Caledon Lake is private with a sign that says ""NO TRESSPASSING WARNING TRAPS INSTALLED"", which is actually located next to Peel School Board learning centre property. I read somewhere it had nice bass in there and I walked 10 minutes from where I parked to get there only to find that sign. And I could see tonnes of small largies cruising the shore and creek mouth of this shallow lake.  I guess many lakes in Caledon are private because of all those rich folks up there."
604070,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-18 20:35:00,4399,"If you do the Credit double check your regs!  BTW talking about hidden gems is verboten, this is the internet don`t ya know!!!"
604084,craigdritchie,2011-07-18 21:25:00,1586,That's because they do not remain hidden gems once you advertise them to the world.
604374,johnnyb,2011-07-19 15:21:00,3413,Best way to figure out the Credit is on foot.  Especially this time of year when you can stay cool by wading in an old pair of running shoes and your shorts.  Orangeville's Island lake can be good....better with a boat IMO...which you can rent while you're there
604412,Jon,2011-07-19 17:06:00,209,Caledon Lake is a private lake and you will be kicked out if the residents see an unfamiliar boat.  Jon
604603,GreenCanada,2011-07-20 02:34:00,375," The best spot in Caledon to fish is               . Whoops, I forgot to add the location, silly me. It must be the rich folk comment that rubbed me the wrong way. Well I will give you a hint, there is a creek that flows under Kennedy Rd just north of Mayfield Rd. I have heard stories of nice specs in there, right around where it crosses under Kennedy. I haven't been there in awhile so I'm not sure how it looks now. You should check it out and report back.   I completely agree, the best way to figure out the Credit is on foot. I did just that last weekend for 6 hours on Saturday and caught a  couple  nice rainbows.   Keywords there are ""if the residents see"". If you want to be stealthy wear earth tones and don't leave garbage behind!"
