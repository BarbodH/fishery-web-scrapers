604339,NAW,2011-07-19 14:03:00,4022,I havn't herd anything good about Mcrae lake.  Poor fishing and dirty campsites.  It'l be a zoo on the long weekend.  Been posted about on here a few times.
604356,chuckymcd,2011-07-19 14:47:00,144,"Thanks for the response NAW, I know it has been posted before but just want some fresh insight on where to go"

604420,OutdoorDan,2011-07-19 17:51:00,325,I would stay away from McRae lake unless you like being surrounded by idiots. Especially on a long weekend.
604448,irishfield,2011-07-19 19:28:00,26272,If you're going to hoot and hauler and make noise.. please go to McCrae !  Otherwise... it's a no brainer as Johnny said!

604661,chuckymcd,2011-07-20 11:34:00,144," hahaha im trying to stay away from that stuff,  Thanks for the responses everyone, looks like we are not going to go to McCrae, but going North!"
