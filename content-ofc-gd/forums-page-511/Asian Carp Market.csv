603934,mercman,2011-07-18 15:19:00,7054,Well thats the best idea i have seen for reducing the population of Asian carp so far. Eat the buggers.Sell them and make money doing it.That's why they were introduced to this country anyways
603935,Jds63,2011-07-18 15:23:00,1365,"that sounds like a good idea ,, win - win situation out of something bad"
603937,Grimace,2011-07-18 15:29:00,2020,Hopefully they don't make too much money off of it or they will want them in the great lakes.

605006,Whalebreath,2011-07-21 04:49:00,15,That guy trying to flog tonnes of that carp  crap should contact BC salmon farms-the price of their usual feedstock has risen and they're now trying to feed farmed fish things you would. not. believe.
