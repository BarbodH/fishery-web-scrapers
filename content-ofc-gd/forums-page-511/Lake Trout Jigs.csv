One is a tube jig that the lead is more long and the eye is in the middle to keep the tube horizontal , I have seen these on the web but was hoping for a store nearby , the other is a lead fish head jig . I have found similar jigs but they are too light , i'm looking for somthing in the 3/4 oz to 1 1/2 oz range . Has anyone here seen these around , I don't really want to buy off the web and wait a couple weeks but it is looking like I might have too !!! Cheers"

603389,Gregoire,2011-07-16 19:42:00,1397,If you ever make it out to the pickering area tighlines in might have some. I always seem to find stuff there that I have trouble finding at other stores. I would call ahead if you are going to make a specific trip as I am not sure if they have them.

604770,johnnyb,2011-07-20 16:25:00,3413,"I found the ones that BassPro makes to be pretty good...nice wide gap hook on them, and the leadhead is made for going in the tube.  Not sure though, if they go over 1oz...think the ones I have are 3/4...."
604918,krawler,2011-07-20 23:54:00,167,"Im looking for the same thing, Bass Pro has nothing bigger than 1oz.  try local shops.  i remember cdn tire had a big twister tail with 2 oz head.  i caught a few lakers on that back in the day."
