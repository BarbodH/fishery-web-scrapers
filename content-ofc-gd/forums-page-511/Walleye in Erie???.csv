Tomorrow is going to be my last kick at the can til August long weekend. Someone Please help me I am at my wits end. I see them stacked like cordwood on the FF drag my lures trough them and no response on any sort. I resorted to dropping a worm harness down 60 feet and all I caught was a goby."
603314,danbouck,2011-07-16 12:21:00,4380,Are you trying Burwell?
603317,HTHM,2011-07-16 12:36:00,4082,No but I may today.
603321,Broker,2011-07-16 13:01:00,482,You could always try the grand river .. If your not getting any luck in erie. both waterbodies are full of walleye
603323,dhickey,2011-07-16 13:11:00,1038,Have you tryed small minnows? Or jigs that look like leaches? Or go lite on the hardware?  Good luck today.
603326,canadadude,2011-07-16 13:27:00,769,"My buddy caught 27 walleye last week, due south of Port Colbourne 65'-70' of water.Fish were between 6 lbs - 9 lbs all on harnesses most off dippsies. 1.9 - 2.2 mph"
603393,bucktail,2011-07-16 20:13:00,1857,"I bet you were off of Maitland. If so its not you it can be a hard fish there no matter what people say. Allot of fish being taken on the west end, Maitland will get better in a few weeks but it is not a numbers fishery there like the west end. erie hates me as well , so keep at it. I feel your pain!"
603409,Uncle Buck,2011-07-16 22:18:00,1000,10 color leadcore and a blue/silver riplin redfin tipped with a worm is my go to erie rig...  it's never failed me...
603474,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-17 02:24:00,336,How big was the goby?
603494,HTHM,2011-07-17 03:51:00,4082,"It gave me 2 inch fillets..... Today, once again no success, got close to 20 smallies though, anywhere from 1 - 4 pounds. two for the skillet the rest went back."
603496,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-17 04:11:00,10439," Yep, I have always done well there. Run out towards the gas wells (60'-70' FOW about 8 miles out) and run chartreuse or perch rippling redfins about 30' down on riggers. Make sure to hook a worm on the three trebles (one point on each treble though the worm). I ran custom 12' rigger rods with 6# test and run your baits about 75'-100' behind the cannon ball."
603497,dave524,2011-07-17 04:23:00,4508," Pretty much the same here. Long leads with a lure that dives off the cannonballs so the balls are above the fish for a stealth approach, my go-to lures are jointed Canadian Wigglers, either the 5 of diamonds pattern or the chartreuse/ green stripe with a 1/2 a dewey on the front treble."
603498,HTHM,2011-07-17 04:59:00,4082,"OK, now I am looking for volunteers to show me how to do this. I have dipseys, no riggers as my boat is a Ranger bass boat. Send me a PM to set something up. Only condition, my boat and tackle. It won't teach me anything if I go in someone else's equipment, I need to learn what i can do with mine. Forgive the PO'ed tone of this post, I used up a weeks vacation time trying to hook a walleye in Ontario. Had fun doing it, but it wouls have been nice to have had success."
604213,hawk-eye,2011-07-19 02:04:00,141,"Sorry about your luck. Ive only been out once this year and I found that the fish were very high in the water outta Burwell. I fished one rigger and 2 dipsys for 3 hours and got one bow. I removed the rigger and dipsys and ran a 3oz inline weight in front of a 6' floro leader. I hammerd 8 in one hour. Try bringing the lures up. Also out of the 9 fish that day all but one was taken on the same spoon, greesy chicken. Good luck."
