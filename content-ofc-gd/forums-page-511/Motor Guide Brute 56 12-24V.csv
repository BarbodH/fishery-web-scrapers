604596,baironhorse,2011-07-20 01:51:00,145,"Not to sound like a broken record…Im a little confused and want to wire this up properly.- sorry If the below sounds silly...from my previous posts I took suggestions from all of you kind folks that took the time to help me out....As I want to upgrade my 36lb 12V to a 56lb 12/24V, I want to connect all up in order....Ok I have the wiring diagram for a 24v series system which I confirmed in previous post is correct…Now I want to confirm the wiring in my 56lb 12/24v system. I have three wires coming out of the unit Black, White and Red. I hooked up the black to NEG and these are my results (Only ONE 12VBATTERY WAS USED to test- Have to buy another one): With switch in 12 V mode: 	Black to NEG 	White to POS- motor works 	Red to POS- motor does not work With switch in 24 V mode: 	Black to Neg 	White to POS- motor does not work 	Red to POS- motor works Can I assume that white wire is for 12V and red wire is for 24V and obviously Black is Negative? Anyone else with this type of TM? I have a attached a pic for reference. Two guys and loaded gear with a choppy water my 36lb struggles a little to pull 16. I figure the 56lb should do the trick. Your thoughts! Thanks "

The red goes to battery #2 positive and the white is your 24 volt leg which goes to battery #1 positive."
604915,baironhorse,2011-07-20 23:45:00,145,Ok from what you are telling me this is what I came up with...I made a drawing let me know if you think its correct so i can hook up this motor...Hopefully I have it now....thanks  
604922,Terry,2011-07-21 00:04:00,14456,by that drawing  the red gives you 24V  and the white gives you 12v  and of course black is the common ground - wire
604932,baironhorse,2011-07-21 00:32:00,145,Hey Terry so everything looks correct to get a 24 v system TM going?  
604939,Terry,2011-07-21 00:41:00,14456,"it is set up for a 12/ 24 v system if you don't need 12 volts, don't hook the white one up to the battery"
604959,baironhorse,2011-07-21 01:40:00,145,"On the above test only ONE 12V BATTERY WAS USED to test- Have to buy another one and Yes i just want 24v system...cause I was startin to worry I would need another wire to be run thru my boat as I currently have two (POS & Neg) for a 12V set up....AS I want to move up to 24v, If I can use the existing wires (4guage marine) and as I have a two feet of wire left over so I can make the jumper cable then all I really need is a second battery..Am I  correct? "
604961,Terry,2011-07-21 01:43:00,14456,yup that will work
