604697,adolson,2011-07-20 13:23:00,783,"So, even though I was being careful, I think I still managed to get a pike y bone stuck in my throat.  Has this happened to anyone else? Any advice to try before I go to the ER?"
604699,Joey,2011-07-20 13:26:00,9122,"Just go to the ER, better safe than sorry  Good luck!"

604711,johnnyb,2011-07-20 14:06:00,3413,"Yup...if you haven't eaten bread yet, try that.  Also...the sensation of having the bone in there will be around long after it's gone....going to the ER won't be pleasant if it's really down there."
604713,Nipfisher,2011-07-20 14:10:00,2449,Bend over and cough. LMAO.
604719,wallyboss,2011-07-20 14:22:00,1095,"I tried bread and it had worked for me. But now the only fish I eat is the ones that ""I"" have filleted."
604723,Rod Caster,2011-07-20 14:33:00,5784,Pike got the last say did he?  Hope it's not a big one.  
604728,Mike Pike,2011-07-20 14:40:00,1332,"Good luck Dana.  Let us know how things go.  Years ago a friend showed me how to fillet 'y' bones out of a pike.  I had to see how someone did it, because I never quite got it looking at diagrams in books.  It's actually fairly simple if you take your time, and I've never looked back.  I enjoy eating pike more without now without having to constently pick 'n spit.  lol"
604744,adolson,2011-07-20 15:15:00,783,"Thanks, all. I hope this loaf of bread works... at 120 calories per slice... :\"
604772,bigugli,2011-07-20 16:32:00,6138,Got one lodged deep in the throat many years back. Had to go for the scope in Emerg.  To this day I gag any time I chew into fish and find bones. Hope the bread works
604781,Dara,2011-07-20 16:43:00,3052,I had a whitefish bone stuck once...took 3 trips to Dr for him to finally get it out...good luk

604845,Dozer,2011-07-20 19:50:00,896,"Talk about the fish fighting back.  Sucks to be you   Breads been mentioned allready, I'm not sure but I thnk my dad swallowed huge peices of bread when he had something jam in his throat.  Don't worry about the calories, just go burn them off wth a jog if you're worried aobut it.  This sorta reminds me of the time a peice of my buddes retainer broke and he swallowed this 2 inch metal peice.  We couldn't stop laughing as hes rolling around from side to side seeking position that didn't hurt as the peice made its way through his intestines.  He drank it off and was fine afterwards."
