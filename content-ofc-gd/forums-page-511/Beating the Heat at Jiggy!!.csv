One of the first things I did though was install an extra ac unit I had at home, I bought it at Home depot for $100 a couple of years back... and had to sneak it in past the wife.    LOL.. I think its the first air conditioned tent, by 6 every one was happy and by 9pm we had to turn it off.. it was TOO cold in the tent!!!  Now off for some fishing today!!"
