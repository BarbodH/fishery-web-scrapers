What i was wondering is what are good techniques for fishing deep water? Everything i have in my tackle box is shallow water gear as i usually just fish the Grandriver.  Thanks for any info."
604229,HTHM,2011-07-19 02:40:00,4082,Dipsey divers and long billed baits come to mind for me. Assuming you're in a boat capable of trolling.
604543,Uncle Buck,2011-07-19 23:36:00,1000,what are you gonna fish for?  musky? carp? ???
604577,n8tivebigguy,2011-07-20 01:16:00,30,I fished there the past few summers for bass in the shallows but i'm interested in trying for musky/pike and some walleye this time around.
604590,mike rousseau,2011-07-20 01:45:00,4661, for walleye  weedlines are between 12-15 feet deep...  so if your trolling... thats close to your target depth. i would stay in 17-19 feet... most deep diver cranks will work here...  rock piles are all different depths so thats your call... i would look for ones that come to 20 feet or shalower and troll over them... unless they come shallower than 15 feet... then troll the sides  you can also drift any of these areas or deep chanels... 60+ with bouncers and harnesses
