604715,skeeter,2011-07-20 14:11:00,1907,"Happy Birthday Roy. Hugs and kisses from Miss Kelly.  Since Canada is metric take your age and divide it by 2.2 That puts you around 31 years old!  I'm just trying to figure out how you will get 31 candles on a cup cake?  PS: Dont invite Randy over to the party, he will fall onto the cup cake, set himself on fire, then trash the house trying to put out the flames....."
