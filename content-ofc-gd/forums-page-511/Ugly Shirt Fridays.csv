603817,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-18 02:55:00,4399,Yes Wayne you win that shirt is damn ugly!!!
603823,mike rousseau,2011-07-18 03:18:00,4661,Ugly... Some of those shirts are the same as my Sunday bests I put on when we go to church and walmart...
603827,Joey,2011-07-18 03:37:00,9122,"We have a winna.......  Yup, that's gotta be the ugliest shirt I've seen in a long time Wayne"
603829,irishfield,2011-07-18 03:41:00,26272,"Leah and I almost got thrown out of Value Village at Bloor and Lansdowne buying our shirts! Laughing so hard, I was in the mens section and she headed over to wimmins. I was holding up shirts and yelling over.. ""what about this one, ugly enough?"""

603859,Fish Farmer,2011-07-18 11:04:00,2234,"You guys would be a HIT at a Beach Boy's Concert.   1st prize for sure I guess I better clean my closet out, my wife has been on me for years. So you guys think my shirts are funny. You hurt my feelings  I love those shirts, only to go back to the days. 50's & 60's"
603869,kickingfrog,2011-07-18 12:07:00,8333,So ugly she had to keep her eyes closed.
603870,Roy,2011-07-18 12:13:00,13728,Future wife repellents for sure.
603876,Spiel,2011-07-18 12:34:00,9065,"That's just sad.....  But to be honest I've seen HH in that shirt before, it's everyday wear."
603881,Harrison,2011-07-18 12:45:00,2202,"OH MAN!!!!!  That is hilarious!  Love the Woody Joe, VINTAGE!  Wayne, what a score, just amazing (Can I borrow it?)  GBW, looks like a camo hunting shirt, LOVE IT!  Leah, I actually have the same shirt, great taste girlfriend!  I'm sorry I had to miss it."
603985,GBW,2011-07-18 17:39:00,8460,"you know what's real funny about that?  We all commented as to ""what type of man would wear that one"" as it is a mens med.  Now we know..."
603997,Terry,2011-07-18 18:03:00,14456,they are ugly
604003,fishnsled,2011-07-18 18:17:00,3520,I can see (barely now after looking at those shirts) why you won Wayne. Care to join us for an ugly shirt day of fishing??
604007,Harrison,2011-07-18 18:18:00,2202,"  HA! The type of man that can drive a small car, doesn't need a ball sack hanging from his spare tire, wears pink dish gloves, cries watching Caddy shack or needs to use a 18ft rod on the rivers to make up for lack of something else.  But real reason, I could give a rat arse what others think.  Plus, I think its cool, but I think the same about my vintage trucker hats and Samantha Fox...."
604023,Headhunter,2011-07-18 18:51:00,5703,"Hey, what ever happended to Samatha Fox... did she end up with mange? HH"
604031,HTHM,2011-07-18 19:00:00,4082,"In 2010, Fox teamed up with trance superstar 4 Strings to release a new single, ""Forever"". Summer 2010 saw the release of a duet with Italian singer Sabrina Salerno in which they performed a cover version of Blondie's hit ""Call Me"". Released in Italy on 15 June, the single peaked at #4 in the Italian Dance Singles Sales Chart on the first week of July.[3]  On 10 August 2010, The Beatles Complete On Ukulele released her reimagining of The Beatles' ""I Should Have Known Better"" featuring ukulele.[4]  from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Fox"

604656,mercman,2011-07-20 11:03:00,7054,"I bet if you sent that shirt to Ripleys Believe it or Not, they would send it back with a note saying ""We just don't believe it Wayne"""
604748,Rattletrap2,2011-07-20 15:18:00,1652," I dunno Phil, a guy does not usually comment ""Love the woody Joe"" to another guy! LOL Just sayin......."
604750,mercman,2011-07-20 15:30:00,7054, good catch RT
604773,Harrison,2011-07-20 16:33:00,2202, HA! Nice one!  I didn't even do that on purpose!
604802,Headhunter,2011-07-20 17:42:00,5703,"I'm not surprised, he has never complained before! HH"
