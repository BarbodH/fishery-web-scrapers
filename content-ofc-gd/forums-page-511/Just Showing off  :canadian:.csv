603577,Curtis,2011-07-17 16:20:00,83,Just finished this one what do you all think? The Blades are over sized because the bait was made for a good friend of mine as a memorial not to be fished but i'm sure it would catch    Thanks for letting me show off hehe have a great day all!
603579,ChrisK,2011-07-17 16:23:00,2772,Love it !! The color scheme is bang on......

603628,misfish,2011-07-17 18:50:00,29133,Great colors.
604290,Curtis,2011-07-19 11:40:00,83,Thanks all  This one wont hit the water because of its purpose but i will surely build another... Thats awesome that you like the colors i just went with what i felt looked good lol.. I wasn't going for a specific pattern when i tied this one just eye catching was all i wanted..
