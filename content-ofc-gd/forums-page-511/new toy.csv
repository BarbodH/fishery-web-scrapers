604410,Spiel,2011-07-19 17:04:00,9065,"Hmmmm, looks like it'd be best worn under a beer belly to keep said beverages out of the sun."
604417,Grimace,2011-07-19 17:38:00,2020, They wouldn't have time to get cold.  :-)
604423,Gregoire,2011-07-19 18:01:00,1397,I prefer the beer belly     Check out the link: http://www.thebeerbelly.com/v/vspfiles/V4_Backup/media_images.asp
604512,Skud,2011-07-19 23:01:00,739,I could have used the Beerbelly at the Jays game on Sunday. Too funny
604515,misfish,2011-07-19 23:04:00,29133,"  You got one,what you need another for?   Crazy prices I know bud."
604520,GBW,2011-07-19 23:19:00,8460,the beer belly idea is great but only if you are into mixed drinks.  I think the beer would go flat in the pouch and hose you drink from.  It's a bikers camo pack in the front rather then back as WAAAAY back when we did try beers in them and it was nasty.  I hope they made the new idea better.
604529,GBW,2011-07-19 23:25:00,8460,"delete your post, we have a marketing plan!"
604532,GBW,2011-07-19 23:27:00,8460,"wait, wait, wait....  I can just see it now.  a guy has to make a stroking motion in public to keep his beer from going flat and the best place to store the device is strapped to your INNER thigh.  the frozen part on your belly would be a nice touch on a hot day to help you keep cool..."
604537,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:32:00,26272,Can't patent it now.. it's been discussed in a public forum !
604540,GBW,2011-07-19 23:34:00,8460,so who want's to keep my beer from going flat...
604541,irishfield,2011-07-19 23:36:00,26272, I've watched you... there's not much chance of that.
604544,GBW,2011-07-19 23:37:00,8460,I don't even want to know what that means.
604545,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-19 23:43:00,4399,Give that dude a carton of smokes and a defibrillator and he`s good too go!!!
