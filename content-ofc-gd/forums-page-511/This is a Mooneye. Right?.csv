602869,Rod Caster,2011-07-15 01:03:00,5784,"JoeyTier caught this little pirahna like fish in the Ottawa river, near Mattawa. I didn't know we had them up this way.  Looks exactly like the goldeye I used to catch in Alberta, minus the gold colored eye.  Next time I fish for big pike, I'm using a large silver Williams spoon.  "
602873,Spiel,2011-07-15 01:05:00,9065,Looks like a Mooneye to me.
602874,irishfield,2011-07-15 01:06:00,26272,I'd say affirmative...
602875,OhioFisherman,2011-07-15 01:07:00,6623,"I believe so, dude that ran one of the bait stores in Pointe Au Baril would also try putting some of them in with our bait years ago. They didn`t look like anything I saw here so I told him no, he said they were moon eyes."
602897,ChrisK,2011-07-15 01:32:00,2772,We get runs of those in the Thames River here in London. Pretty sure the moon eye and gold eye are the same species just different color morphs... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooneye
602900,Rod Caster,2011-07-15 01:42:00,5784,"agreed Chris.... the body and mouth are the exact same. I was quite suprised to see them up here. We fried some up in AB and they tasted like mud, ok in the smoker though.   "
602903,ChrisK,2011-07-15 01:44:00,2772,"Doesn't suprise me being a part of the gizard shad family.....yuk,double yuk !!"
602905,Rod Caster,2011-07-15 01:49:00,5784," That's odd, considering that seagulls have such a sophistocated palate."
602908,vinnimon,2011-07-15 01:49:00,2593,"Looks like it, fun to catch on an ultra light on the grand."
602922,ChrisK,2011-07-15 02:20:00,2772,Ya but so does my dog......
602939,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-15 02:58:00,10439," Manitobans are big fans of Goldeye, so much so that they even call their minor league baseball team ""The Goldeyes"". They make great catfish bait though."
602955,Hooked,2011-07-15 03:53:00,891,"A dead giveaway is their tongue, has 2 saber like teeth on them.  Really wild.  I caught one at BOQ one time probably weighed at least a pound.  Not much until you see how skinny they are.  Good fight too actually, thought I had a small rainbow on at first."
602957,mike rousseau,2011-07-15 03:55:00,4661,I'd like to tie one of those on for Muskie... It would be a garountee hit
602981,Rod Caster,2011-07-15 11:04:00,5784, I was thinking the same for big pike... Mooneye aren't considered a game fish so I imagine its allowed.
603008,mike rousseau,2011-07-15 13:07:00,4661,Yup... You just gotta find em and then catch em
603173,Joeytier,2011-07-15 20:57:00,3990,"Yep, definitely a mooneye.  I prefer to call them freshwater pirahna."
603211,Bill Shearer,2011-07-15 22:41:00,456,"Lots of fun to catch. Tiny bit of worm on a #8 hook, below a float, makes a dozen worms last the morning. Great to catch when all the other possibilities are slow. The grand below the dam at Caledonia is a good start although they can be found almost anywhere"
603244,Steve_R,2011-07-16 01:03:00,81,Yes Chris l use to catch alot of them in the Thames lots of fun...
603511,pikehunter,2011-07-17 11:02:00,1659,Caught one trolling the Grand above the Dunnville dam a five or six years ago. Went over the same spot several more times but not another to be found.
604191,Michael_Brown,2011-07-19 01:26:00,411,There are lots of Mooneye in the Ottawa river system. We have fished there for a few years and always catch a couple.  We now know the Ontario Record for Mooneye is 1.43 lbs caught in the Rainy River system. http://www.ofah.org/fishresources/index.cfm?ID=7  Below is a photo of one we caught and cut up for catfish bait shortly after photo. It was over 2lbs.     We did land some nice channel cats using the chunks.
604298,Rod Caster,2011-07-19 12:17:00,5784,"In rainy river? well then, nothing suprising about the ottawa then.  Michael, you fed catfish a record fish? You could have been famous, a legendary Mooneye wrangler. Hehe that's a good size fish! I'm definitly using one for pike bait next time."
604429,nuke,2011-07-19 18:19:00,60,Caught some on the Grand on the fly.  Not that big though.  I do remember their stentch after unhooking them.  I was worst than a sheepshead in August!!  Mike
