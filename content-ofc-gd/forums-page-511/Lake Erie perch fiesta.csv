Double headers, mixed doubles, huge pigs....waooo...I do a lot of Lake Simcoe perching in the fall and some in winter but those Erie perch are something else. Now I kind of understand the locals obsession with perching vs. eyes or bows on Erie...42 fow, minnows were the most desired menu.          After such a busy day on the water someone mentioned the word ""beach"" on the way back...so we had to stop there for some water fun, followed by visits to the burger and ice cream shops....    All that made for a happy crew on the return trip home ha ha ha  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
603459,Grimace,2011-07-17 01:35:00,2020,Awesome.  The ice cream industry on the North shore of Eastern Lake Erie is booming!!!   Well done.
