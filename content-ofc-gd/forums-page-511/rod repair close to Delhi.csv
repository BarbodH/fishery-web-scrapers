599503,skinny,2011-07-05 11:01:00,442,ok i was getting everything ready to go out on Sunday and when I put my one rod in the boat the line whent limp and the jig head fell. I picked it up and retied it to the braid and had same thing happen this is with braid. I then noticed that the top eye had a broken insert in it so I figure it must be sharp and cutting the line . I thought about just buying new rod but then wondered if I could get this fix close by and resonable.

599526,Spiel,2011-07-05 12:35:00,9065,It's an easy do it yourself fix. A little gentle heat from a lighter and it'll slide right off. Then take the rod to a local tackle shop and see if they have a replacement. Reinstall with a little thermal cement or 5 minute epoxy and your good to go.
602516,skinny,2011-07-14 10:59:00,442,well I got the tip off and have in my pocket with hopes of going by a shop that will have the tip . I'm now working for a company doing service work so I end up all over Ontario. The Boss is a good guy and usally if I ask he stops at stores and such as long as it's not to long.
602536,scugpg,2011-07-14 12:19:00,1373,Take it to Angling Outfitters just outside Woodstock 519-539-5494  Or London way Lambeth Rod & Tackle 519-652-5598  Either of those shops should get you in order quickly.
604254,skinny,2011-07-19 04:05:00,442,ok got a tip just need to glue it on i don't have any 5 min epoxy here right now i have some stuff called goop wil it work or should i get some 5 min just for this job
604255,irishfield,2011-07-19 04:10:00,26272,"Goop stays soft and you'll find the tip falling off again. I had my Muskie rod tip come loose at Lakair, even after using 5 min epoxy, I sure wouldn't trust GOOP."

604411,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-19 17:06:00,1107,this is definately NOT the proper way to fix it but I was in a pinch and used hot glue and some clear nail polish to make it look finished and that was 3 years ago and it's still on there the nail polish was dollar store stuff to I would use speil's method first but if your stuck the hot glue will work did for me anyways
