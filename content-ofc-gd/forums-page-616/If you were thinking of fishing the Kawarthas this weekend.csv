Seeing that its going to be cool and really windy most of the weekend, I still need to get out fishing!  Want to try muskie for a bit and then switch to meal mode for walleye and crappie and heck maybe a small bass or two.  If you wanted to avoid the wind, where would you go and still have a good chance for the above species?  Was thinking Scugog river either below the locks or the creeks towards Lake Scugog. Either that or Pigeon river near Emily. Not sure of many other sheltered areas around Lindsay.  If you have any other suggestions I'd really appreciate it!"
515618,Rizzo,2010-10-28 18:15:00,4754,I'm in the same boat as you....why didn't I buy a bigger boat with a canopy!
515624,cram,2010-10-28 18:27:00,1733,"Long johns, wool sweater, toque, mitts, and a rain suit to cut the wind.  Or a float suit.  And a big thermos of warm coffee."
515832,mbac31,2010-10-29 11:37:00,904,"Big thermos of coffee, warm clothes and mitts will be doing the trick for us Tomorrow on Balsam. Wind is you friend in the fall. Walleye and Smallies will be up in the shallows cruising the wind beaten shorelines. I have some of my best days in the late fall like this. Who wouldnt want to get walleye all day long in less than 4 fow. Good luck out there. I will be out there and finally getting to that long awaited shore lunch tomorrow with 3 good friends of mine, cant wait."
515844,Keenan,2010-10-29 12:45:00,59,Walleye were on fire last night below the locks in Lindsay.
515924,fish-miester,2010-10-29 17:22:00,864,was out on the bog yesterday and well sinclair said it best.. stay to the west side. unless your in the mood to be tossed around.  as for a report there isnt much of one from me haha
516311,scugpg,2010-10-31 11:33:00,1373, We tried Chemong and Scugog river...didn't expect a 1ft chop in the river!  Keenan I'm not surprised by the locks; the river is flowing fast at the dam...even down at the boat launch downstream we were getting pushes by the current.  Anyhow managed 2 tiny perch and 1 walleye. That's it.  Came home yesterday and should have left today for there...weather is much better now.  Smalliefisher let us know how you did.
