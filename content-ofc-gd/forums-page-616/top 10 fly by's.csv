516749,irishfield,2010-11-01 23:33:00,26272,"Thanks Louis! Someone posted that up a week or so ago... never dull. My idea of a low pass though.. is 55mph.. 2 feet off the trees heading into a back lake for Brookies/Lakers and looking for shoals from the air!  <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L8fDtRZLkw?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L8fDtRZLkw?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L8fDtRZLkw?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>"

516752,irishfield,2010-11-01 23:46:00,26272,Not in my airplane Andy.. don't have one of those obnoxious things!! I can get mine in the air at 38 MPH... although it does like to stay above 50...
516753,TerryC,2010-11-01 23:57:00,196,Thanks for posting this. Very Cool.  Clarence
516754,Raf,2010-11-01 23:58:00,3495,that's pretty cool wayne.  how fast are you moving when you touch down?
516755,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 23:59:00,0,I never much liked that sound. Specially stol's...
516756,irishfield,2010-11-02 00:03:00,26272, Depends on when and where.. but I'm usually touching down on the water doing about 45mph. Sometimes it's 60 or so.. all depends on winds/gusts etc being compensated for. Double click on the embedded video to take you to Youtube and then click the icon above the video..and it will show all the videos I did this summer and the ones Lloyd shot with me last year Raf.
