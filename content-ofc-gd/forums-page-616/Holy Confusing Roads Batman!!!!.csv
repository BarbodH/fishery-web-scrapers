The most confusing road in the world  Magic Roundabout, Swindon, England England loves its roundabouts, that’s no secret. They invented the Mini just for hooning around the things. Sometimes the Brits can get a little carried away with their own cleverness though. This nightmare consists of five smaller clockwise roundabouts with an anticlockwise roundabout in the centre. Imagine if they tried this in Canada, you’d just have mayhem, honking, cars moving in every direction. Apparently the trick to navigating these is just to hold your breath, floor it, and hope you come out the other side.  "

516307,dave524,2010-10-31 09:43:00,4508,How many remember the old QEW / HWY #20 traffic circle? same idea but not quite as insane.  Or even stoplights on the QEW Niagara ?

516559,John,2010-11-01 12:17:00,2956,Actually it works very well. The fundamental problem we have here in NA is that our cojones are too big and we resent yielding to traffic that has the right of way. Take 5 mins and study it and it will all make sense. Remember you are driving on the opposite side of the road.

Locals drove wherever there was an opening...wrong side of the road, sidewalks, anything was game.  Stop signs, lights, etc. were nothing more than a suggestion.  Traffic was so congested at times in the city center they actually had entertainers performing at traffic lights to try and ease the tension.  Filipinas wearing white suits with giant foam fingers dancing around and gesturing ala Steve Martin. Pretty comical actually.  I'm very thankful to live where I do. People complain about the QEW, but in comparison it's not that bad.  That traffic circle looks like a piece of cake LOL!"
516563,Hud,2010-11-01 12:33:00,140,Look kids.... Big Ben....Parliment. Sorry but that gave me a flas to European Vacation when Clark can't get out of the round about
