516777,Sharkbait22,2010-11-02 01:07:00,297,Nice fish and clours! All the bows I landed in September were big.  Nothing small.  Seems like those dry years coughed up little recruitment.  The water levels have come down quite a bit from late September?  Would you say the run is half way through or almost done? There is a slight chance I might make it up there Nov 20th.
