515570,Rich,2010-10-28 15:02:00,3927,"I recently purchased a new boat from buddy at work, it's on a homemade trailer. I've gone to the courthouse twice now, sat for 2-3 hrs each time and got sent home cuz I didn't have everything I needed.  NOW, I think I'm finally ready. I have the completed trailer registration from the previous owner. Description of the the trailer. I have my own necessary identification.  Is this enough to go put a stupid license plate on my trailer? It's pretty bad it took 2 months with the current registration system to get one. I just dont want to have another wasted morning at the courthouse so if I am forgetting anything or can do anything that will make this go easier please let me know. I'm dying to use my new boat and don't want to tow it illegally to do so! Any advice? Am I forgetting anything?  Oh yeah, I have the $20 for the plate cost too. lol  Here's the boat and trailer.. the Filth Deluxe. Will be buying a bow mount and graphs this weekend and HOPEFULLY giving her a test run!  "

515588,Garnet,2010-10-28 16:20:00,2056,Go to DMV tell them you made the trailer. Pay your money and be done with it. You will get ownership and vin # you need scribe on trailer.
515621,ADB,2010-10-28 18:25:00,444, Ditto.
515625,Cosmos,2010-10-28 18:27:00,588, I did it same way. It took me 10 minutes to get all papers and license plate.
515628,SBCregal,2010-10-28 18:41:00,688,"yup.... same here, only it took 10 minutes. you sign a paper saying its home built, approx what it weighs, etc and walk out with your plates.  ownership says homebuilt on it."
516742,Rich,2010-11-01 22:45:00,3927,"Thanks for the advice guys. I just ended up bringing in what I had and it was done and overwith real quick. Had to pay tax on the trailer, no biggie. Took her on the bay this Saturday for the first time. Smooth riding boat.  "
