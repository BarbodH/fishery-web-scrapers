Lots of walleye again, and a baby muskie on the second cast on a 4"" sucker minnow.  Lots of slot fish today, fun to catch but supper was looking doubtful until the sun started to set, then a fish a cast for 20 minutes and off i went with 4 nice fish which my boy took great delight in helping me clean when i got home.   <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2eCx1IIQes?hl=en&fs=1""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2eCx1IIQes?hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2eCx1IIQes?hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object>"

516837,rufus,2010-11-02 13:11:00,267,"Nice afternoon of fishing Simon! Funny how we hope the tug on the line is a small walleye (a keeper) rather than a big one, eh? Watching your video and seeing the forecast for the next week is tough since I have already put the boat away for the winter  Looks like you have a terrific helper"

516874,limeyangler,2010-11-02 16:33:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies gang     Kwan, you seem to do pretty well right where you are! If your ever up this way let me know...always room for one more in my leaky tinpot boat.    Yup....only last week at the same spot i was cursing all the keeper size i was catching, one week later the tables turned...but i'm at work now about to cook for my co-workers ....again...they are spoiled."
516957,Leecher,2010-11-02 21:34:00,7832,Awesome report and video Simon Thanks for sharing and keep up the great work Leechman
516967,Kwan,2010-11-02 22:11:00,132,Thanks!  It is my buddy who is hitting all the walleye when we head out-  mine just steal my minnows.
