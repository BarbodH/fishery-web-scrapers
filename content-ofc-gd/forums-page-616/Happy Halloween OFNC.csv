516638,Beans,2010-11-01 16:05:00,3339,We only had two lots of four kids and two lots of two kids show up this year...  Good thing the wife didn't buy the candy bars that were on sale at Shopper's...  I'm now up to my a$$ in small bags of chips (4x28 bags)...  Maybe CPH and I can use them for our carp'n snack instead of Dad's Cookies...
516642,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-01 16:28:00,2582, LOL... if they last until carping season...I'm all over it  We had 20 kids this year. Used to get over 150...but all the kids in our area have grown up and moved away.  At 47 we are actually spring chickens compared to most of our neighbors.  Lotsa left over chocolate bars for Carp Point Beansie...if Debbe hides them on me. That's the only chance they have of making it that long. **as I sneak my 10th one of the morning**

516645,lew,2010-11-01 16:37:00,12766,"In Toronto we always got around 200 kids for Halloween but now were out in the country and there's only 2 kids on the road, sisters actually around 7 & 8. They showed up last night with their pooch who was in costume too.  Problem is though, we knew there wouldn't be any more kids coming so the wife didn't stock up and now I'm candyless with no leftover bags of goodies to munch on"
516646,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-01 16:41:00,2582, Lew if you can get to my place within the next...oh 15 minutes...you might be able to wrestle a couple of bags of M&M's from me.
516648,lew,2010-11-01 16:59:00,12766," You'll have to gimme 2 days to finish painting the family room CPH, then I'll be right over"

516657,lew,2010-11-01 17:27:00,12766,"Ya better grab a few more bags of M&M's CPH, cause when the family room is done, there's 6 more rooms to go....and that's just downstairs"
