515877,Headhunter,2010-10-29 14:59:00,5703,"If I was going to fish Quinte in the next week or two, I would be concentrating on Adolphus Reach, from the gap to the ferry. After that time frame, I would be looking mostly from the ferry to Hay Bay, with Picton harbour being a main focus. HH"

515918,Headhunter,2010-10-29 17:10:00,5703,"You have to cover a ton of water to find active fish. The Bay has really changed since the zebra's showed up. I would firstly, try and find productive water away from the crowds as these fish are not used to boats, they live in Lake O most of their lives. I'm not at all surprised guys are having a hard time gettin'em... Don't forget to try the top ten feet of water on your troll, especially if there is some decent wave action that day, or it's a dark cloudy day. Shiney baits for sunny days and dark baits for cloudy days. Tight wobble baits will out fish wide wobble baits. HH"

516386,Fish Farmer,2010-10-31 17:09:00,2234,"A lot of people cast around the Picton docks or if you can get permission along the north shore to Glenora, I know a few guys that cast that way do better than us in boats. I've seen some big fish netted at the docks, but that's night fishing. Myself, I gave up on the night fishing, no fun in the dark or it could be the old thing I was down last week with 7 other Guys 3 boats and caught 1 fish near the ferry. Heard a few guys did better near Bath. We trolled as far as the Bat Cave. Be more fun catching them casting than trolling anyway.  But that's night fishin Good Luck Bud"
