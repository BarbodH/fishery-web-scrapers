516500,Leecher,2010-11-01 02:22:00,7832,"cram, get a Photobucket account then it's just a matter of uploading your pics to it and copying the image code into your new post Leechman"
516507,cram,2010-11-01 02:29:00,1733, YOu're a good man. Thanks.  btw - love the spinnerbaits.  Curious - any idea why imageshak or tinypic don't work??? Should be same as photobucket.
516509,irishfield,2010-11-01 02:33:00,26272,May not be where you load and link from at all... if you name your pictures with any blank spacing.. it gives them a file name with the % sign in it and OFC won't take them as it thinks they're dynamic links. Be sure when you name your pics like so... cramwalleye1
516510,Leecher,2010-11-01 02:33:00,7832, Thanks cram!!!  Not sure why these sites don't work     It's a lot easier with Photobucket
