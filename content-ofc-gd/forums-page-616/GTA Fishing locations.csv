515986,fisher12,2010-10-29 21:01:00,81,"Where are some places to catch fish in the GTA? What can you catch there and which are the best baits and lures to use there? (I already know of Lake ontario shore spots such as Frenchman's bay and Port credit,the rivers in Toronto and Mississauga and all of the places listed at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165643.html)"
515987,GBW,2010-10-29 21:05:00,8460,this is going to get UGLY and quick... get out and walk with one of your folks after you use google maps to find areas.  then make sure you read the regulations for the area you do go to.  the season is closed and or closing for some areas and fish so make sure you know what you can fish for and where.

516078,miller,2010-10-30 06:47:00,223,i'll second that   hahaha
516093,Gregoire,2010-10-30 12:35:00,1397,"A web search and a google search would serve you well. The best way to learn is to get out there and talk to people who you see fishing. While you may get some tips about where to go, requesting specific baits and techniques for an area that is heavily fished like Toronto is not likely to get you many positive responses. In fact requesting this information makes it less likely to get it. My advice to you would be to get out and fish. Bring a camera and post a report."
516128,fisher12,2010-10-30 15:50:00,81," I started fishing this summer, I think I will be going to Pefferlaw ,lake simcoe."
516132,mercman,2010-10-30 16:02:00,7054,  Great !!! Ice fishing is lots of fun.Dress warm or rent a hut to stay warm.Simcoe has some good fish in it.Get some Rapala vertical jigs and put a piece of worm or a berkley Grup on it.
516134,fisher12,2010-10-30 16:16:00,81, I was planning on going on family fishing day and I thought minnows were the best for ice fishing.
516135,fisher12,2010-10-30 16:17:00,81, What do people usually catch ice fishing lake simcoe? Perch? Pike?
516136,fishinguypat,2010-10-30 16:18:00,547, A guy in a trench coat told me  there are a couple fish in Lake Ontario
516138,mercman,2010-10-30 16:44:00,7054,"  From what i hear, perch, pike walleye and if your lucky, some small mouth. All depends where you open the ice. Usually pike perch and walleye though"
516139,mercman,2010-10-30 16:46:00,7054,  they are definately good!!!
