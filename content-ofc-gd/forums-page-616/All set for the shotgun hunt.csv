Sat in the front field for a few hours .    It was time to figure out where I was going to set up the ground blind for this up coming shotgun hunt which starts Monday   . At first I was going to set it up in the thick greens,as this is where the big boys will hide,but I have one stand already in a good spot,so I went for a walk instead to see if there was any sign of good traffic and also, scrapes and rubs and bedding area.  I start my walk to the north part of the property.Once I get there,Im seeing some good traffic spots and bedding.These deer change thier habits every year. Due to food plots and/or, maybe cause of the yotes.  So I see a good spot to set up the blind.    Another angle    Here are a few vids of the area.

Just might be the big boy hanging around after all.    Checked all the bush stands out, and alls good to go.  Back out in the morning to sit for bit again with the bow,then it,s iron time.   Saddly,this weeks hunt will be with a bit of a heavy heart.A member of the hunt camp I used to hunt ,passed away from cancer this past week. His memorial will be Tuesday.The best way I can remember him, will to be sitting in my stand. Im sure he would want it that way.  Yer in the big buck hunting grounds now Cal.God bless.    Thanks for reading and everyone be safe out there.Dont forget your ORANGE"
516185,Leecher,2010-10-30 19:50:00,7832,"So you got the deer signs all figured out.... now time for the sit & wait game  If I was you, I'd create a scrape with buck urine near where you setup your blind..... just to get the boys in the hood irritated a bit to come and investigate  Sorry to hear of the passing of a friend you use to hunt with Brian May his soul rest in peace  Good luck with the up coming iron season..... Be safe and shoot straight Jacques"
516187,bushart,2010-10-30 19:59:00,2628,Good Luck Brian---Leave some fer seed man.
516193,kickingfrog,2010-10-30 20:08:00,8333,Good luck Brian. Almost game time.
516197,irishfield,2010-10-30 20:18:00,26272,At least you didn't try to cut your hand off setting up your blind !!  Good luck my friend... this years's got your name on it.
516204,canadadude,2010-10-30 20:46:00,769,"Word of advice, Doe & buck scents are illeagle now in Ontario.....don't get caught using these products or it may be an expensive hunt"
516205,irishfield,2010-10-30 20:50:00,26272,As long as it's synthetic.. it's totally legal. Only Natural scents are banned for fear of spreading disease.
516213,Leecher,2010-10-30 21:16:00,7832," Exactly.... any CTC or local sportsman store will carry them.  I don't know about Ontario but in Quebec, the only illegal thing to use is an electronic device to lure your game towards you..... all other scents and calls are legal"
516223,misfish,2010-10-30 22:30:00,29133,"   Yes I was aware of the new rule/law.   Lost the smell after 2 hours.The real stuff,you could smell for days.  When we hunted as a group, we would use a buck or doe  gland.Natural scent.   TY Jacques"
516231,Rustic-Fisher,2010-10-30 23:01:00,826,"Looks promising!! If only I could pull my self away from the grouse,woodcock and pheasant to prepare for the deer LOL. R"
516241,Skud,2010-10-30 23:43:00,739,Looks like a great vantage point from that blind location. Would be good for calling in some Yotes after iron season too. Hope to see you nail that big buck that got the drop on you last year.  I enjoyed watching a mature doe for about 20 minutes this afternoon from my blind. It was really great to observe her at eye level from less than twenty yards. I will be out there again in the morning and afternoon. Hope to have a buck come in before the controlled hunt drives them all to night time activity only.  Good Luck!
516342,chilli,2010-10-31 14:10:00,199,"I'm a tree guy myself. You can see so much more from that awesome tree behind you. The blind allows you move move a little bit more and keeps you out of the weather but the sunrise/set is just incredible from the tree.  Another tip if hunting the edge of a field is use one of those broadhead target deer decoys. They fool the younger bucks even when not in rut but will get the big boys in to investigate during the rut even when your scent wears off.  Funny thing about those scents. They real ones were made illegal because of a disease we don't have here in Ontario and the alternative may be toxic. Because ""scent"" is protected by proprietary disclosure rights they don't have to list what's in it to make it smell. I wonder if its any safer.  Have a good hunt and think of your friend often in the field."
516346,Terry,2010-10-31 14:27:00,14456,sorry about your friend  good luck on the hunt
516361,misfish,2010-10-31 15:44:00,29133,"I,ll be in the stands in the morning and the blind for the afternoon part of the day.Full days for me. Your right,you see so much more.  When I arrived this morning,it was hailing pellets,so I decided to sit and stay dry in the blind.It pretty much did that all morning,then the snow came.They said it was to be the nicest day of the weekend.  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvidmg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv731%2Fmisfish%2F20101030_01.mp4"">   Ohwell,at least I got my pail of fresh brocolli from the field. Im aloud to take after the first pick.BONUS. The mrs,s blanches and then freezes them up.     Now it,s time to check and double check everything for Monday."
516362,irishfield,2010-10-31 15:54:00,26272,Guess you live in the wrong end of the County Brian.. Sunny up here.. and 2 degrees.
516363,Terry,2010-10-31 15:58:00,14456, I thought you were going to write and show a picture of the 10 bucks that walked across the runway this morning to get out of the way of the turkeys that were scared by the moose  LOL
516364,fishnsled,2010-10-31 16:03:00,3520,Sorry to hear of the passing of your friend but I'm guessing he will be watching over you tomorrow. Good Luck Brian.  PS - Thanks for sending the snow to the south.
516365,Chuck Best,2010-10-31 16:09:00,308,"Looks and sounds like you got it covered for tomorrow buddy,here's to hoping all goes as planned.....My partner goes tomorrow as well,I have to wait another month,but by then,we'll have them figured out again....TC and straight shots....Chuck...P.S. Sorry to hear of the passing of your friend..."
