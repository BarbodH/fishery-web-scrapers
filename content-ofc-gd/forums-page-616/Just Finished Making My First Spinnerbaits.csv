516707,Handlebarz,2010-11-01 19:59:00,3790,Nice work The pike do love spinner baits for sure I like that pattern on the crank baits
516713,fishnsled,2010-11-01 20:06:00,3520,I can't believe you'd post pictures of that stuff.  I'll take them from you and save you the embarrassment of showing others.  You can thank me later.     Nice work Jaques!!   Now go get some teeth marks in them.  
516716,Leecher,2010-11-01 20:34:00,7832, Thanks Mike!!!  The cranks are going to be killer..... just have a good feeling about them   LOL Thanks fishnsled!!!  How much you willing to pay for them beauts    I sure will
516779,vinnimon,2010-11-02 01:18:00,2593,Nice work Jacques! Keep it up!   
516782,rufus,2010-11-02 01:32:00,267,Great job on the spinners and cranks! I have tried making spinners but need to go to remedial wire-bending school...
516788,Spiel,2010-11-02 01:49:00,9065,"You're getting carried away Jacques, you already catch too many fish and now it'll be even more!  Great job, those spinner baits are sweet and those cranks are spectacular."
516797,ChrisK,2010-11-02 02:08:00,2772,Excellent job on those baits Leechman.I particularly like the chaurtruse spinner bait. Its always been one of my favorite colors for bass...
516804,Leecher,2010-11-02 02:58:00,7832," Thanks Vinni!!!   Thanks NWO Fishing!!!  Got to take the wire bending real slow.... once the loop is done, closing the gap is just as slow   Am I really??  Thanks Chris!!! I can't wait to give those a try   Thanks ChrisK!!! Yeah chartreuse is one of my favorite too.... including white"
516064,Leecher,2010-10-30 03:20:00,7832,"Like the title says.... just finished making my very first spinnerbaits, thought I'd share to results  Love this one and I think it's going to be killer.... added trailer hooks to them for better hook set        Threesome    Tight lines Leechman"
516066,Joey,2010-10-30 03:38:00,9122,"Ohhhh, I like the yellow one!!!  You did a fine job on all tho, they look great!!  Joey"
516069,Leecher,2010-10-30 04:03:00,7832, Thanks Joey!!!
516073,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-30 04:53:00,1107,  I do believe thats chartreuse LOL good job Leechman

516097,limeyangler,2010-10-30 12:52:00,5204,"Good job Jacques, i also like the chartreuse one. Dunno why i like it....considering i've never thrown a spinnerbait in my life!"
516111,Leecher,2010-10-30 14:26:00,7832," Thanks SRT8!!!   Thanks Chris!!!   Thanks Simon!!!  Now that I got familiar with the components required to build one, I will buy them in bulk instead of kits and my favorite color is white  You should try them on your home lake Simon, they're a real pike and bass magnet"
516113,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-30 14:30:00,2690,"Nice work, Jacques!  Red and black looks killer, but, chartreuse is my go to colour."
516121,Leecher,2010-10-30 14:45:00,7832," Thanks Frank!!!  Chartreuse or white, both are good colors.... I was hoping that the kits would have a least one white but didn't.... next order will get white skirts with colorado & willowleaf blades  Now I got to work on the 2-3/4"" bass crankbaits...... and guess what color they are going to be???   Yeah...... white and chartreuse"
516148,bassmaster4,2010-10-30 17:29:00,801,Those look great!
516166,tb4me,2010-10-30 18:23:00,3295,Nice work Leechman! I tried making those but I couldnt get the loops bent in the wire without ruining them. Is there a trick im missing? I was thinking a wire bender would be nice but I dont have the extra $ to buy one..Good work once again!
516167,misfish,2010-10-30 18:32:00,29133,Dont you have enough to do already?LOL  Nice work.
516189,Leecher,2010-10-30 20:01:00,7832," Thanks bassmaster4!!!   Thanks tb4me!!!  All you need are needle nose pliers.... trick to it is to leave a 1/4"" of wire past where you set your pliers and slowly bend the wire inward.... don't rush it and take you time.  Once the loop is created, you have to close the gap by squeezing it together.... again very slowly.... my first try was perfect, second was a little short and had to ajust, third was spick & span   Thanks Brian!!!  Yes I still do..... that was just to relax a bit     Can't blame a guy for trying"
516194,mercman,2010-10-30 20:09:00,7054,Hey nice job!! i bought some walley harness kits and some french spinner kits.Saving them for january when i normally go into hibernation mode.
