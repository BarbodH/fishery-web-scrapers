516015,Roy,2010-10-30 00:10:00,13728," Nah, she might as well be making baits, Wayne. I was talking to Paul tonight and his eyes are really hurtin' from looking at her. Here's a shot off the web cam. He might need medical attention. "
516016,irishfield,2010-10-30 00:14:00,26272,Not the first time he's looked like that Roy...
516020,Terry,2010-10-30 00:33:00,14456,LOL  and nice baits
516024,kickingfrog,2010-10-30 00:42:00,8333,Do I see a weight peaking out from underneath the skirt of that first one?  Joey-skirt-underneath-  insert punchline here_______________________  Serious question though.
516030,Joey,2010-10-30 01:01:00,9122,"  Yep, weights on both those rubber skirted ones.  Gotta get em down to the musky ya know     Wayne, there was supposed to be a honeymoon?  Nobody told me that, I've been gypped!!!!"
516034,mistyriver1,2010-10-30 01:23:00,600,"Very nice Joey.  If you go to Rollie and Helen's website, they've got a nice selection of the #10 blades.  I've put them on my Christmas wish list   .   I just made a couple of baits a couple of weeks ago similiar to your first two Joey with the #8 blades as well with Flashabou.  The thing I find is the #8's doesnt give the flashabou the same action as the #10's do.  They still work OK but just not as much action."
516048,Joey,2010-10-30 02:22:00,9122," Ya, the 10's are hard to find, but I just ordered some up and they're in the mail  I've seen your lures Jim, they're really nice"
516055,Leecher,2010-10-30 03:01:00,7832,"Great work Jo-Anne Funny, I was working on making my first spinnerbaits tonight I'll post a report to show them soon Leechman"
516080,Handlebarz,2010-10-30 10:27:00,3790,Nice work as always Joey it sure is nice to atleast be able to make something for musky when you can chase them. hope to see you guys down here soon if the wind can stay away for a bit.   Cheers Mike
516090,Gregoire,2010-10-30 12:26:00,1397,That white a purple spinner looks tasty
516115,Joey,2010-10-30 14:32:00,9122," Thanks Mike, how is the wind?"
516143,Handlebarz,2010-10-30 17:00:00,3790,It's rockin good right now about 20MPH from the south it would be a fun ride on the lake today kinda like every year LOL
516155,Rich Clemens,2010-10-30 17:56:00,3131,And to think of the bucks I just put down for 4 Double-Cowgirls from muskytackle.online.  These are better as I know Joey puts a little something extra in the bucktails she makes.
516791,Spiel,2010-11-02 01:52:00,9065,".... ""at least you can make lures""  Well maybe you can and quite beautifully I might add, but I'll stick to rod work.  Oh and they are well crafted beauties!"
516798,ChrisK,2010-11-02 02:14:00,2772,"Joey those are some sweet lookin baits. You have definetely come a long way since your first creations. I would put those up against any Grim Reaper out of my tackle box for sure. Really like your weighted bucktails with the replaceable treble hook option. Solid lookin,great job !!"
516802,limeyangler,2010-11-02 02:43:00,5204,"Nice lures Joey, look better than all of the crap they wanna charge $25 a piece for at the store!"
516808,Joey,2010-11-02 03:30:00,9122,"Well thanks guys, and I don't charge $25....... yet!!!"
