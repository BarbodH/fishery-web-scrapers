I had a ton of things planned but instead I worked A LOT  A little while ago a got me an old polaris 250 ATV and decided to get it ready for the ice fishing season.  I started out with some new tires on the rear. These will be studded for the ice.    Then I started building the rear box.    It holds EVERYTHING, even has some padding for the passenger      Got her painted up and adding weather stripping, stainless hinges and latches    So today I decide that I GOTTA get out fishing, I loaded up the ATV just in case I wanted to cruise down the beach. Weather Network said North wind at 10 km/h... perfect! Got down there and it's a west wind at 50km/h   Good thing I bought the ATV because I opened the boathouse door and...    Boat is beached in the boathouse   :wallbash:  :wallbash:  Now I need to wait for an east wind and get it the hell outta there.  Well I ended up cruising around on the atv and found the limit for the tires    Ended up coming home early and will be picking the family up at the airport tomorrow."

516230,HTHM,2010-10-30 23:00:00,4082,Looks good Dan! You're forgetting the woodshop you were working in not that long ago????
516235,danbouck,2010-10-30 23:16:00,4380, I was thinking about that but only had a couple hours to do it
516236,danbouck,2010-10-30 23:16:00,4380, yep lowest I have ever seen it.
516237,spincast,2010-10-30 23:27:00,3279,"that water level is scary. everywhere this year the water is down huge, and its not like we haven't had rain - at least where I live - only once this year did the grass get dry enough to need watering. As much as I am not a winter person, here's hoping for a heavy snowfall this winter to replenish our water levels. Another season like this the entire innner bay not be there by the end of the season!"
516271,BiggFish,2010-10-31 02:12:00,40,"Hey Dan,  Based on the size of the box you built, it looks like you may even have space to make me and my fishing gear out ice fishing?  Looks good,  Chad"
