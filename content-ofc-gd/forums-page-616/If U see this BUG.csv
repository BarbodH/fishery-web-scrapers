516104,Bondar,2010-10-30 13:57:00,817,"I found this article on a fishing web site  ........and it was mentioned the word should be spread about these colourful critters . They release a cyanide gas when annoyed or handled which could cause serious risks for humans . They may be found in our own wooded areas like Rockway , St.Johns pond ,the Niagara gorge, etc etc . They are a millipede with very bright colours and a hard exterior shell . I wouldn't pick one those things up anyway , but curious kids might ! They look more like a centipede to me (100 legs) a friend took the time to post this on another site so i copied it to here http://bugguide.net/node/view/8260 Heres the one we saw last week that my buddy took a pic of Good thing we didnt  touch it as we had no idea what it was  "

516249,Sharkbait22,2010-10-31 00:06:00,297,Where did you find this bug?  I've fished the glen for years as a kid and adult and I've never seen one.  Freaky. Climate change cometh.

516282,bigfish1965,2010-10-31 02:56:00,3382,Wow...and in south Niagara this year they have found a Black Widow and a Brown Recluse spider. Gonna have to carry raid with me now
516291,fishyfingers,2010-10-31 03:21:00,46,"not to worry, there is no way in hell I will be touching that thing!"
516299,Dave Bailey,2010-10-31 04:16:00,1641," Widow spiders occur in Ontario as far north as Georgian Bay, but for the most part they aren't marked the same as the one everybody thinks about. Do a Google image search for ""Latrodectus variolus"" for pictures, they differ from the better known L. mactans. As far as I know varioulus is just as venomous as mactans."

516458,mercman,2010-10-31 23:25:00,7054,They had a fire ant infestation in the maritimes this summer As the world gets warmer we are gonna see some really nasty changes happening ih the bug world.All we are missing now is killer bees!!!!
516542,singingdog,2010-11-01 10:09:00,1047,"It's a millipede. Contrary to popular belief, the # of legs doesn't tell you what it is. Centipedes have loooong legs that trail behind their body and are very fast. Millipedes have short legs and are slow. If you get a really close look: Millipedes have 2 pairs of legs/body segment: centipedes only one."
