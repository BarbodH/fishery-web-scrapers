514442,richyb,2010-10-24 14:56:00,774,The only problem with buying a small chunk of land that has access to crown is that most crown land has pretty much been claimed by locals and hunting gangs as their own hunting grounds. I know anyone should have the rights to it but hunting gangs get pretty teritorial and it could cause huge problems.
514447,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-24 15:06:00,2582,"Hands down...go for the closer property. Having experienced 11 hour drives to our first ""Getaway""...5.5 hours to our 2nd ""Getaway"" and finally 75 minutes to our third I can tell you the closer the better. Everything and I mean everything, is just made easier and BETTER by having your little piece of heaven closer. And the words of wisdom others have offered about the camp progressing as you age and your needs/wants changing WILL HAPPEN I guarantee it.  Those beauty properties WAY up north in the middle of the wilderness are heaven, no doubt about it...I drool everytime someone posts about a trip up to there remote piece of heaven. But there is a huge investment of time and sweat that comes with them and a leisurely weekend visit is absolutely out of the question.You have to decide if your up to that type of commitment. Or if you just wanna have a closer Getaway that is easier to enjoy. My experience is the closer the better.  Good luck with your property choice."
514449,Bernie,2010-10-24 15:19:00,3190,"Outhouses illegal? Hmmm. don't think so. Properly constructed, an outhouse works quite well.  http://www.cottageplanner.com/articles/outhouses-building-codes/  An 8 hour drive is a long one although it may be a great place when finished. I like the idea of having the place right near the lake. I would have to see both properties to make a final decision."
514510,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-24 22:47:00,2582, Yes gas cost can be a consideration...but what is a mile... and what is a gallon
514511,Billy Bob,2010-10-24 22:48:00,5865, A mile and a gallon is what a pound and a inch is in fishing....
514626,cityfisher,2010-10-25 12:50:00,959,im also in the same process  Ive noticed that its Illegal to have a trailer/rv on your property as a primary residence.. I know that ALOT of people do it and i bet most times the town dont have a clue or dont care.  id come with the closer location... 8 hours is way out of my range !
514629,solopaddler,2010-10-25 13:13:00,8605,"My place is 7-71/2 hours north, and also water access.  For me the longer drive is a complete non issue. If I were you I wouldn't let that deter me. Especially if the property is better and it offers better fishing and hunting.  You'll find a way to get there plenty of times if you buy it, trust me. Where there's a will there's a way.  Also bear in mind property taxes are SIGNIFICANTLY less in an unorganized township. That's a big plus.  Since my place was purchased it's literally been rebuilt from the ground up.  Yes it was a chore to haul stuff over but it was a labour of love."
516602,Moosebunk,2010-11-01 14:44:00,3970,"Have no idea what your costs are going to be in total... start to finish of all projects, land taxes and everything else considered for the rest of your days..?  Not sure how old the kids are, how long they may actually get to enjoy the fruits of your labor, how often in the near future they will join you in such a camp and receive quality time when dad isn't working on building, cleaning and clearing beaches, cabins and roads...?   Not sure how much time you could get with them and for yourself doing other things today and during days ahead if you chose to spend the same on other options?   Not to discourage Cook.  Simply playing Devil's Advocate.  Good luck in your choice.  I'd go with the closer property, especially if your life is mon-fri 9-5.  You have a shiftworkers life like Solo or myself... further may not be that difficult after the solid investment of time to get set-up."
516800,Cookslav,2010-11-02 02:16:00,1457,"My hours and shifts are very flexible so time is not an issue at all. I usualy work long stints, and catch up like wise....(Sometimes 14 days in a row, then off for 6)  But unfortunatley a decision has been made for me.... The closer property has some ""iregular"" zoneing/controling issues. The Quinte Conservation authority whom governs the abutting crown land have made it illegal to hunt Deer which is a huge drag.... I can hunt small game, and birds within the given seasons but Deer are off limits It seems the Conservation authority, took a back route to canceling a Provincially regulated hunt by ""leasing"" the land during the hunt....TO THEMSELVES!!! So ya....that property just lost my interst.  So I'm now looking a lot closer at the Northern property. But The price needs to move, as they are way over priced. A property 25% larger, with similar land(high and dry) sold for $10k less then the asking price in June. And I've had 3 seperate agencies give me an assesment of value that concurs with my assumption.... They need to drop the price 8-10K to be in the ball park. But we'll see..."
516823,Billy Bob,2010-11-02 10:13:00,5865, Bottom line it's a BUYERS Market....
516824,solopaddler,2010-11-02 10:19:00,8605, Exactly. Considering the time of year you should be able to do better than 8-10 less.
516828,Cookslav,2010-11-02 10:43:00,1457," Yup. I told the agent that when I offered.... And when they declined firm at their asking price.... I told them when they were willing to deal in that range(provided they do so ""before"" the snow flys) My offer will stand. They have my contact info, so the ball is in their court now.  Truth be told I know more about their situation then a buyer normally would LOL.... I canvassed the area including local land owners, and a camp near by for some info on the land/access etc. And it turns out a couple of them know the sellers, and were happy to divulge some information about why they are selling!!!  it Turns out they bought ""another"" slightly larger property which they liked better that was a real steal of a price in May... So they are now trying to sell the parcel I'm interested in. But of course they jacked the price to bank roll the other new property.  The issue is.... Them paying a ""steal"" of a deal on the other property actually hurt them, as it dropped the selling price by comparison on the other parcel. (it's litterally in veiw of the other property I'm attempting to purchse)  And to boot.... They are also just now begining to realize this ""steal"" of a deal they got in May is actually MUCH closer to the genuine value then they paid for the first parcel 2 years ago.  I feel Sad for them getting hosed but....I'm not going to pay for their mistakes. Meh...We'll see how it turns out I guesss?  But they've been on the market since they bought the other property in May and to my knowledge I'm the only one persuing it right now. If I hear back soon...great....If not the search continues"
513899,Cookslav,2010-10-22 15:15:00,1457,"So I've come to the point in my Life where a Recreational Property is border line affordable LOL...  I have my eyes on a couple of Propeties, and I'm being pretty discriminating in my wants My Property MUST have both Fishing, and Hunting opportunitys at the back door, or its not going to cut it. I have 2 properties I'm really persueing currently, and the haggleing proccess has begun for both.   One is northern ontario(8 hours drive)Water access only, 15acres abutting 1000's of acres of crown land. Its unorganized township, which means building permits are not a concern, but actually getting supplies in to build could be difficult. Game species are Moose, deer, bear, Grouse, pickerel, smallmouth bass, pike, whitefish. The Pro's -very remote, quiet -flat gravel/rock shore line(easy access)  The Con's -Long drive -Hard to build remotely -More expensive by $10k(and have to pay a yearly crossing/launching fee) -The Potential for future logging in the area is there...this could be noisy, but ""could"" also bring future road access  The Second property is in southern ontario and closer at only 4 hours drive. It has 6acres of land abutting 1000's of acres of conservation land for which hunting is permitted. Currently has Water and road access ""too"" the property, but not to the water where we would want to build. BUT...cutting a road is an option, and fairly strait forward from what I can tell. Game species are Moose, deer, bear, Grouse, pickerel, smallmouth & Largemouth Bass & Muskie Pro's -closer by 4 hours -potential drive in access  Con's -a bit less remote -Building permits required(could get around that with an RV which I already own) -shore line is a bit swampy  Tough decision ahead for me.... The northern property is more money, and will require more time invested to develop but would be a true remote destination. It would also limit my time spent there...8 hours is a long drive for a weekend  The Southern property is less money, less effort, and I already have an RV that could make for good accomodations should building permits be an issue. Its also an easy drive for a weekend trip at 3-4 hours But is less remote....  Fishing and hunting opportunities are equal in my oppinion. More moose and bear in the northern property, but bigger more plentifull deer in the southern property.... More Pike, and pickerel in the northern property, but Largemouth and Muskie in the southern Property... Both Properties have suitable building areas, and are High and dry.  What's a boy to do????  I'm just looking for experiences in this proccess... Anyone ever cut in a road? Anyone ever build a remote cabin with water access only?  Any advice at all for a newbie in this realm is appreciated?"
513902,TC1OZ,2010-10-22 15:28:00,987,"Just PM me when you need help! I'll bring the muscle!  I've been thinking of looking into it, but I know I can't afford it."
513907,danbouck,2010-10-22 15:40:00,4380,Can't help but here are some good properties
513908,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-22 15:41:00,0,i'd be looking close to home so that weekends are possible.  part of the beauty of having a little peace of heaven is being able to use it.  even if it's just visiting the property to cut grass and have a cold one.
513909,NAW,2010-10-22 15:45:00,4022,"A friend and I are looking at splitting the cost of a 200 acre property.  I'm also pondering the same things you are.  No good advice here, but I'll be watching this post carefully.  Hopefully you get some good advice!"
513920,troutologist,2010-10-22 16:38:00,951,"Another consideration with the property further away, with limited visits would be security and leaving supplies etc there.  This gets to be a lot of hauling things in and out all the time.  I like the idea of being able to use a place like this as much as possible; this in turn allows for more enjoyment, as a property you visit a couple times a year, alot of the time is spent opening and closing and doing other required up keep."
513961,Cookslav,2010-10-22 18:50:00,1457, 200 acres is a lot more road to cut in then 6 acres though LOL... I think you'd be in need of a loader for that handy work? Thats half the reason I targeted properties abutting crown land that are under 20 acres. Cutting a road in is tough work I imagine? Cutting tree's is the least of my worries if I am understanding the job correctly....its the filling thats tough. Lugging gravel etc.... (Especially with out a loader)
513992,MuskieWannabe,2010-10-22 19:52:00,79,Don't let a swampy shoreline scare you....Yuo can turn it into a nice shoreline with some work and by just spending time in the water. the more time you sepnd in the water the more the muck will be stirred up and it should wash away.  Even raking the sand will stir it up and help it along...
513995,irishfield,2010-10-22 19:56:00,26272,What he said.. just don't let anyone see you disturbing it.
514010,Kilka,2010-10-22 20:57:00,17,"OP,  Do you have a family or is this solely for your use?"
514017,Musky or Specks,2010-10-22 21:53:00,2710,I'll spit driving time with you to the further property.
514018,BUSTER,2010-10-22 21:57:00,1336,"DRIVE TIME Is the killer, but you could buy a plane and leave it at Irishfield?   Did you look here:http://www.dignam.com/"

514030,Musky or Specks,2010-10-22 22:33:00,2710,Sounds a little autobiographical Irish
514031,irishfield,2010-10-22 22:48:00,26272,
514032,Cookslav,2010-10-22 22:51:00,1457," A good freind and fellow board member ""Big Swede"" is investing in this endevour with me. So its definatly more for us guys as an outdoor project first and foremost but.... over time the kids and gals might be invited  It will be rustic & 100% off the grid. I'm looking forward to working on it, and ""over time"" building a cabin with a few modern conveinences like hot water, and a composting toilet, and installing Solar/generator power...the usual advanced camp comforts.  But for now its about hunting, fishing, and the enjoyment of carving something out of the bush. Pit toilet, maybe a shack to start....potentially a trailer and addion. Anything goes for now....even thought about TJ's idea with a prospectors tent.  In a nut shell... Its more about solitude, catching fish, hunting, and being able to shout with out getting in crap.... I've had an RV in a trailer park for 5 years, and had enough of watching what I say, where I step, and how loud I talk. Watching the clock to ensure I don't make to much noise after 10:30pm is not relaxing any more LOL!  In truth growing up We have had a family freind with a camp north of Havelock and its paradise which is where my plan came from.... The problem is someday that camp will handed down, or sold, and I'm not on that waiting list, so my days there are numbered I simply want to continue enjoying that kind of outdoor privilage and Iwant my kids to enjoy the camp scene the way I did some day. No one else is going to do it for me so...I'm manning up and get'n it done.  Swampy shore line is no big deal...thats what a dock is for I suppose? But good to know that it can be ""tamed"" a bit  Cutting a road is the most daunting part of the Southern property for sure."
514033,Cookslav,2010-10-22 22:53:00,1457," Half way through a case? Geeze I hope she had more beer in the boat, other wise it would be a long trip back to town for her"
514079,smally21,2010-10-23 00:29:00,993,"just for the boys id get as far away as possible, thus leabing the 'rules' further behind. but closer is probably better, get more use out of it, less stress behind the wheel. the southern property is likely to appreciate faster..."
514145,Nipfisher,2010-10-23 02:48:00,2449,"Cookslav, in general where is the northern property? Close to which town? For your purposes I would suggest the closer property. My cousin lives in Toronto (Younge and Lawrence) and 5 years ago he bought a point of an island on the French river. It is a 3-4 hour drive then he has to get in the boat with all the gear, drive 20-30 minutes by boat (15hp) and then lug everything up to his site. He has to pay for a slip all year to have his boat ready for him. He has worked on it for 5 years and it is not done yet. It will have all the ammenities but still it is not anywhere near complete. The bonus is I am only 1.5 hours from it and I have a bigger boat (90hp).  If you can be there in 3-4 hours that means you could be fishing, drinking, relaxing in 4-5 hrs."
514166,blue pickeral,2010-10-23 07:10:00,267,"Been through this, although somewhat earlier....if you are at the age where you can afford it, won't be long before you'll be at the age when you'll appreciate convenience. Get the closer property. You will start out 'rustic' - my first camp had propane only- but as time passes and family spreads out, such things as cell and internet come in real handy.  As for road building, survey a route, cut down trees, get a contractor with bull dozer, add gravel to your initial goat track when you can afford it. Have no experience with composting toilets, but an approved septic system works well without 'handling' of waste or use of power. Outhouse - illegal now I think - not very good - doesn't process sewage."
514203,irishfield,2010-10-23 14:43:00,26272,The Manager of the Temiskiming health unit actually believes that an outhouse is the best system there is for cottages/camps! (& it definetly beats crapping in the woods!)  Unfortunately.. the building code probably won't let you proceed to a permit without health approval for a septic system..
514424,Cookslav,2010-10-24 12:56:00,1457,"It'll be an outhouse to start regardless of the laws LOL.... Not much choice other then crapping in the woods....just like 90% of the other camps out there. But I did put some thought into grabbing a composting toilet at some point once we're settled in a bit. A Septic system some day would be nice but may also be hard to get approval on with no ""official"" road access?"
514426,blue pickeral,2010-10-24 13:00:00,267," While respectful of your wisdom on this forum, I have to question the benefits of an outhouse - other than the obvious better than the deep wood dump scenario - a pile of ecoli simply spreads out through the water table over time, particularly in rock/clay layers. Dumping lye etc. just (somewhat) keeps down the smell. No treatment of raw sewage occurs as in other systems."
514436,Billy Bob,2010-10-24 14:19:00,5865,"I did this back in 1979 but the property was only 80 miles away....built from the ground up within sight of Chautauqua Lake but also had great deer and grouse hunting. It took me 4 years to finish it. LOTS of hard work and money.....EVERY weekend and holiday was spent building the ""cottage"". Don't know how old you are now but the older you get the hard it gets to do this and then the drive to do it is not there. So keep that in mind.  My advice would be to go for the closer piece of property if this is something you are REALLY committed to do...if you quit half way through the process you will take a beating if you sell. Driving even 4 hours is way too much time spent on the road IMHO. You would be MUCH better off purchasing a cottage/cabin that needs some work, but of course that's up to you.  One thing you MUST consider is what will you do when gas prices SPIKE once again and they WILL......even the 4 hour drive has to be over 200 miles away. Do the math with gas costing you $5 - $7 per gallon. OUCH ! ! !  Good Luck in your decision, Bob"
514437,irishfield,2010-10-24 14:22:00,26272, It's not my wisdom... I was simply stating that the manager/inspector of the Temiskiming Health unit says that an outhouse is the best septic system that exists.
