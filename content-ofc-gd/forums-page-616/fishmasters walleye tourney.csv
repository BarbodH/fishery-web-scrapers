516750,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-01 23:42:00,0,Congrats on the win! I lost a few anchors fishing near the dam!!
516796,Rod Caster,2010-11-02 02:07:00,5784,Good job man! It's not easy to win any tourney. They allowed minnows in the tourney?  
516799,johndox,2010-11-02 02:15:00,54,"Fished 2 boats over from Corvette all day long and fishing was very tough. There were only 5 fish caught all day  and  they caught 3 of them. I think the biggest one was over 3 lbs if i remember correctly. Fished this tourney 3 years and after last year said i was not going back again but im a die hard and dont like to put my boat away too early because the Grand river gives up a lot of Walleye this time of year. I had 3 buddies that wanted to go in this derby and were very disapointed in the fact that it cost over 50 bucks a boat to enter and at the end of the day there there is nothing, no prize table or anything other than he weighs the fish in and has a bbq. Then they commented on the fact that he was charging 2 bucks for  burger. so needless to say I guess there are 4 guys that are not back next year."
516801,limeyangler,2010-11-02 02:33:00,5204,Well done Corvy!!!  30mph winds??? you sure it was mph and not kmh?  either way.....tough conditions for sure...double kudos to ya amigo!
516803,solopaddler,2010-11-02 02:51:00,8605,  Wow!   You gotta be kidding me.    Congrat's on the win though!
516805,moemoe,2010-11-02 03:10:00,352,"50 bucks a boat seems pretty reasonable, $17 and change per person, is pretty cheap entertainment for a day,"
516812,ld17,2010-11-02 03:37:00,319,congrats on the win.  You guys deserve it.  I was there and watched you bag all 3 fish.  I also lost my anchor that day.  The wind was 30-50km.  40 bucks to enter + 10 big fish + 5 bucks to launch.  55 total.  + 2 dozen minnows 6 bucks and your over 60 bucks.  Would be nice to have free lunch even if some place in the price were paying for it.  Good derby for late in the year.  It's nice to get money for the win instead of prizes you really don't need.  Next year I guess...lol
