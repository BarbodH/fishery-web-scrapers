My buddy are I are trying come up with a quick plan for a last minute trip.  Basically looking to rent a cottage or cabin at a good fishing lake within a couple hours from Barrie.  Preferably targeting walleye although really anything is good. We were kind of thinking Kawarthas although we don't know the lakes except Canal. Finding cottages open at this time of year is a bit difficult.  If anyone has any ideas you could share that'd be great.  It's just a little cold for camping.  Cheers Gov"
