516673,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 18:29:00,0, Rule how they may. It's up to you to prove you did nothing wrong in court. What part do you not understand? Having to go to court to prove yourself is something that shouldn't happen unless you've done something wrong in the first place. Knowing your rights.  I didn't think what I said was so cryptic...
516682,capt bruce,2010-11-01 19:12:00,820,"""Let he who has ne'er seen a fish flop in his kitchen sink cast the first stone.""  LOL your right there I have had bass taken from my wet well and placed in cooler on ice come back to life in my sink after 2 hour trip home , after that Happening I gill all the keepers now and put on ice as they are caught . But this is not a WOW FISH CAME BACK ALIVE , he admittes to running air pump to make sure they were alive , BIG BIG dif . As a co a few fish with no water that return from to dead is ALOT different than a guy who is knowing trying to keep fish alive. I know this guy is a good guy who just didnt know what he did was wrong , I will bet the fort that he does not do this again just a case of not knowing . WE PAY FOR A licence ,please guys read the rules that you paid to follow ."

516696,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 19:34:00,0, Don't tell her how you aim to deal with them. My wife doesn't care what happens other than that I come home at the end of the day.....with dinner of course. The kids and I only bring her along for the extra line anyway. Being disabled and the fact that we are trolling makes it more fun/work for the kids to help her reel them in. She's usually the only one who catches anything anyway.
516698,mercman,2010-11-01 19:38:00,7054, Thats too kewl. Mine closes her eyes when i put the worm on her hook.She still catches more tham me though.She can sense a fish faster then my sonar.It kills me

An officer cares very much about the interpertation of laws,when they go into court to prove a charge there reputation aswell as who they represent is on the line. The officer better make sure he has a good case, the crown does not want to waste time on useless infractions."
516607,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 15:04:00,0,  caps are ok....lol but pretty sure won't cut it. As for live perch in the bucket on Simcoe...that can get you a fine as well if you were pulled over with them flippig around in a bucket with or without water in it. As buddy just said. They can live and swim even after being frozen and the MNR knows this just as you do.
516608,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 15:07:00,0,  no water...didnt know the goby was even in there..it would have dried up.... again...I love the assumptions but they are just that and you can and will be fined for transporting live fish be it goby....or perch from simcoe as I just said in the post above lol....but hey...it'll be your fine.  The charge was dismissed but my point here is that you have to go to court to prove yourself and that by itself is pure CRAP....lol all this to prove what I said in my first post....

516622,ctranter,2010-11-01 15:35:00,543," Innocent until proven guilty  Seriously though, I've seen a CO twice in my life, both times he just smiled and waved.  My impression was that this CO perceived me (based on gear/whatever) as highly unlikely to be breaking any offense, so he chose to spend his time more wisely.  Sure enough I walk downstream and he's hiding in the bushes, video taping some snaggers.  Through my experience with CO's, they certainly didn't come off as power-crazed ticket machines with a lust for finding any possible way to screw you over, like this thread seems to imply.  (Don't group yourself with the white bucket brigade by bringing home live fish though  )"
516623,mercman,2010-11-01 15:35:00,7054," no, i just don't think that MNR officers are mindless dummies who are out to ticket and fine everyone who makes the slightest mistake.They are there to catch the idiots who show no respect for the environment nor the sport.They have been trained to recognize these do no gooders by reading there body language and assesing their answers to questions and taking a fast inventory of the equipment used by the angler.Most have the same training as police officers to a certain extent.I once looked into what is needed to become a CO.They are very well educated in law, and have excellent people skills. Maybe i'm too idealistic, but i like to think that if you show respect to an officer of the law, it goes along way in saving your a..s....s These officers are there to educate and protect the environment.Not harass us for transporting a live fish flopping around in your trunk. can they??? hell ya. Will they??? depends on your attitude."
516624,mercman,2010-11-01 15:37:00,7054,"  if i didnt fish, and have some understanding of the rules, sure. but i wouldnt post that on this board, thats for sure"
516633,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 15:56:00,0,  Keep thinking the way you do and see where it gets you. No one said the mnr were mindless dummies. Read my first post and see if that helps you any. There are some who like to know their rights. Your attitude should not enter into the law.  Defending yourself against ambiguities is my point here just in case you missed that part...  The MNR are not both judge and officer all rolled into one. crying to them will not help much....

516654,ctranter,2010-11-01 17:17:00,543,"  Those were two times that I personally encountered a CO.  Many people fish their entire lives and never see one.  My point stretched beyond myself, and to accounts from countless friends of mine who all had the same thing to say.  Either way, this thread is getting derailed quickly.  CO's are not fish-Nazi's.  Moving on..."

Those kinda people don't fish much and most likely will not have a good run in with the mnr when they do. At least where I fish anyway. Again. The point here is that you can be charged with Bulcrap fines regardless of your experience. Moving right along...at a snails pace..."

I know them by name and say Hi to Bruce each time. He knows I have done nothing wrong and have never been charged with anything. It's their job and they do it well but...it still leaves each and everyone of us open to a fine because the laws are ambiguous in so many ways. I'm sure there are lots of experienced people on this site who know of charges given out...why?...because they can and did for all the wrong reasons. This year was a easy one. The total time taken from me fishing in prime time was close to two 5 hours at 15 mins each time.

516517,irishfield,2010-11-01 02:51:00,26272,"Just cautioning you and hope a mod removes this thread once you've read it.

516521,Gerritt,2010-11-01 03:00:00,6129,"Agreed. Heed Waynes' advice... it is illegal to transport live fish unless you are licensed to do so.

516522,Kwan,2010-11-01 03:00:00,132,so does this mean that I should be killing the fish before I take it home if i am keeping it for food?
516524,Gerritt,2010-11-01 03:03:00,6129,  Yes. exactly that.
516525,irishfield,2010-11-01 03:04:00,26272,They'll taste better if  you kill them and bleed them out before taking them home anyhow. Put a bag of ice in that cooler instead of water and haul them home dead.
516526,Kwan,2010-11-01 03:06:00,132,This is something that I absolutely did not know  edit to add:  thanks- if i ever got inspected for my catch I guess I would be in a heap of trouble for keeping the air pump running in the cooler

516550,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-01 11:48:00,0,"Don't worry about it Kwan. I didn't know either. I keep my fish on a stringer, or sometimes in my livewell to keep them fresh, and sometimes they are alive when I get home. Especially, the catfish and bowfin. I think this law is so that people don't take live fish and put them in other lakes, where they may destroy the eco system of the lake.  Anyways, thanks for the report and we both learned something today."

516572,Jaymerica,2010-11-01 13:07:00,12,What about transporting live fish to a derby weigh in? The Grand River Bass derby requires you to transport your catch live from as far away as Paris to the derby headquarters in Kitchener. Is this legal?
516575,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-01 13:12:00,2690," You sure would, Kwan.  Wayne is just trying to be helpful and pass on some important info.  Last year I made the same mistake, wasn't even thinking about it.  Had a dozen or so perch in my livewell, and, drove home with them...still alive.  I got home, started unhooking everything, went to get them...looked over at my better half, and, said ""oh, crap, you know I just broke the law"".  It dawned on me as soon as I got home...first and last time I made that mistake.  Those are some really nice crappies and walleyes you are catching.  Sometimes that ""night shift"" really pays off!"

516588,perchslayer666,2010-11-01 13:59:00,280,"Ok, this shouldn't even be an issue... Kwan caught the fish, and brought it home to consume it, not raise it in a fish tank. Who hasn't brought home a cooler with perch and ice to find that they are still alive when they are in the sink?  Do you really think a CO will do anything about this??? I personally respect the law however this a ""grey area"" where no one will be prosecuted if found with live fish packed in ice for transportation. If the fish was being housed in water with an aerator, that would be grounds for an legit charge based on the outlined rules for transporting live fish.  Jesus Christ people on this board need to grow some walnuts, and not be so conservative."
516589,toca,2010-11-01 14:02:00,274,true. but i think mr.kwan mention about a air pump and a cooler full of water.  the intent was to keep them as fresh as they could be but other might think it for something else.  he just asked a simple question and was given back feed back.  keep them alive until u are ready to take home.  cheers tooddd
516590,Roy,2010-11-01 14:05:00,13728,"The best way is, if you're going to be keeping a meal, dispatch them as it is caught and directly on ice. Unless you're in a tourney, a livewell is useless IMHO."
516591,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 14:08:00,0,There are lots of ambiguous regs which leave you open to charges. It's sad to think you have to defend yourself in a court system for such crap. Everyone should be able to know their rights on the water and feel comfortable knowing that what they are doing is right.
516593,canadadude,2010-11-01 14:20:00,769,"The law all comes down to intent, if you have a stringer of walleye floping in your trunk or cooler a CO is not going to bust you for transporting live fish. However if you have the same walleye in a cooler filled with water and perhaps an airator your intent is to transport these fish alive and this would be grounds for an infraction."
516596,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 14:27:00,0,  I love the assumption.  ...Fact is that they can charge you if they want.
516599,Nipfisher,2010-11-01 14:37:00,2449,Curious about ice fishing. I bring walley home frozen solid from laying on the ice. Put them in the sink and as they thaw they start kicking again? I guess that is a no-no too?
516601,canadadude,2010-11-01 14:43:00,769,"It's not an assumption,to prove your intending to transport fish alive the CO is going to need evidence that this was the intent, a few fish floping in a cooler will not provide adequate evidence to prove your intent is to break the law.However if you have adequate things to keep these fish alive while transporting then those would be seized and provide evidence that your intent was to transport live fish. Any judge in Ontario would throw the CO out of his court room if he said I saw a fish flop in a cooler so I busted the guy for transporting live fish, and any lawyer worth a grain of salt would have a field day with this CO"
516603,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 14:45:00,0, Live fish are live fish. You have to prove yourself in the court system. The officer could care less what you have to say. It's the sad truth of it really.  Here's an example for you that happened to someone I know last year. He was checked by the mnr. They looked in his live well that was empty. They found a somewhat live Goby in it that a pickerel had puked up. He was fined for having a live Goby in his possession.  You would have assumed differently but the sad reality of it is that they can and will charge you if they see fit.
