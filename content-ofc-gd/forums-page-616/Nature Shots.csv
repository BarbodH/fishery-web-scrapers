516620,l2p,2010-11-01 15:28:00,346,"I figured id post more nature pics rather than fish pics this time around.  enjoy.             the most birds ive ever seen. wish i had a wide angle lense, there was literally thousands of birds. when they took off it sounded like a prop plane taking of cause of their wings smackin the water. very cool annd rare sight indeed.   ofcourse the last chromer of oct, "
516625,ctranter,2010-11-01 15:39:00,543,Nice pics!  Do you jack up the contrast in your pics or does your camera shoot like that?  Looks really cool in the seagull pic at the bluffs.
516626,l2p,2010-11-01 15:45:00,346,"i play around with some of them, its hard to take the time sometimes when im out to take a proper picture with the correct settings so i usualy do some touching up. a couple of the pics uptop might have been overdone actually."
516627,MJL,2010-11-01 15:48:00,2427,"Technically speaking Mark, your 14-42mm is a wide angle lens (albeit a zoom lens).  Definitely wishing I had the 10-20mm though for my own baby.  I could make my fish look twice as big in hero shots  Really digging the early morning/evening shots.  Iâ€™m hoping to shoot some star/sunrise time lapse vids in the future when I pick up a new digital timer"
516628,Joey,2010-11-01 15:48:00,9122,Very nice pics.  I like the bridge one the best!!  Joey
516629,ctranter,2010-11-01 15:49:00,543," It's that overdone effect that I enjoy, actually  .  Do you edit with CameraRAW/Photoshop? I'm trying to learn them, myself."
516636,Dave Bailey,2010-11-01 16:03:00,1641, I've been trying to get a shot like that for years. Beautiful.
516639,mercman,2010-11-01 16:19:00,7054,VERY NICE !! Fall is a great season for photography.The lighting gives every thing that contrasted look.Thanks for sharing these. Paul

516741,Victor,2010-11-01 22:43:00,1609,"Uh so you do own an Olympus too!  I posted on Kelfun's fb pic (a pic of you) and asked whether you had an olympus (cuz i saw the neckstrap), but he probably thought i asked him and said he owns the Olympus tough.  Great shots!"
516775,l2p,2010-11-02 01:03:00,346,"haha thanks, its actualy my dads and i just bring it out with me."
516789,MJL,2010-11-02 01:49:00,2427, Us Canon and Nikon owners point and laugh in the faces of Olympus DSLR owners  HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!
516811,Dave Bailey,2010-11-02 03:36:00,1641," I love Olympus cameras, and I have used their 24 megapixel jobs for over 30 years... an OM-1 with Fujichrome!"
516818,Victor,2010-11-02 04:56:00,1609," Mike, next time you land a fish I'll help you dunk it in the river and test out how ""weather resistent"" your camera is"
516820,l2p,2010-11-02 05:43:00,346,"lol one time we were leaving rouge and i put the camera on top of my friends ek hatchback and somehow forgot it there until it was a little too late. got out and low behold nothing more than a few scratches, not even the lense cap came off lol."
516853,frozen-fire,2010-11-02 14:08:00,542, That's durability right there!
516878,Jet,2010-11-02 16:49:00,364,You just might be better at nature watching than steelheading! Nice stuff bro. I think you could take some real nice scenery shots out my way.
