515894,TJQ,2010-10-29 16:11:00,7806,"A very good friend of mine, France, gives a ton of time to help cancer patients, she helps run a non profit organization called Highlights for Hope (you can check it out here) http://www.highlightsforhope.ca/  Anyway, they are trying to win a car from Cambrian Ford in Sudbury. If you would like to help out you can view the video and rate/vote for her here...  http://www.mycambrianford.com/node/79  France is a real go-getter and to be honest, I've never seen another individual work so hard to help others. Lets help her out. - its just a click away!  Even a superhero needs some help sometimes!"
