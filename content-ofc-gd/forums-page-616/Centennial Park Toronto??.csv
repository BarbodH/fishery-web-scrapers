326422,rbaquial,2009-04-05 02:18:00,968,I've read before (not too sure if its in regs) that you aren't allowed to fish in there - I've also heard of people catching Catfish in there...

326458,rbaquial,2009-04-05 03:39:00,968, That'd be the one
326461,eze76,2009-04-05 03:46:00,70,Yuppers..  Okie Dokie well i see alot of ppl fishing there...  Ive gone there a couple times haven't caught anything but a sunfish or two :| LOL  only reason i go there is because its a short bike ride away
326462,rbaquial,2009-04-05 03:47:00,968,"Better not to go there - if you are caught fishing there, i'm assuming it'd be a hefty fine..."
326697,camillj,2009-04-05 21:26:00,1988,Thats news to me .. I can walk there and often do ... and almost ALWAYS see people fishing there ... I have never seen anything other than panfish .. and I have never seen or heard of them being told to stop .... but it has never had any appeal to make me want to wet a line ... kinda like needing to go to the other side of your lake to fish .. just too close to home
326817,douG,2009-04-06 01:28:00,2693,That pond is my backyard.
326881,eze76,2009-04-06 03:11:00,70,That is the only reason i go there is because its close and when i have no where else to go i got there just to fish..  Ive caught a couple sunfish lol and i think theirs some catfish in there don't know what else tho
326887,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-06 03:15:00,270,   hey there network to meet people ..alot of good people in Toronto with vehicles who  may take you out maybe!
326904,eze76,2009-04-06 04:44:00,70,LOL well im only 16 would feel kinda awkward but i still go out fishing at the credit and stuff...  Its just that its really close
326994,charlesn,2009-04-06 15:04:00,551,"I had no idea about that rule.  About 10 years ago when I worked in etobicoke, I would drive thru Cent Park every day just for the relaxing drive and view.  I stopped once and fished the horseshoe shaped pond after work.  I caught 1 crappie, 2 largies and and a bunch of sunnies.  I saw several guys with serious carp gear.  You'd think they could put up a sign or two if it is a sanctuary.  I walked the entire perimeter just about and saw no signage but several other anglers.  Oh well, I broke the speed limit once on the 401 too so maybe it's just that I am a scofflaw.  Charles"
516126,fisher12,2010-10-30 15:44:00,81,Anyone try this park? What did you catch there?
516243,brifishrgy,2010-10-30 23:44:00,559, well its an old thread and in case you missed it you arent allowed to fish there so it doesnt really matter what is in there
516256,fisher12,2010-10-31 00:22:00,81, So Why is it listed at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165643.html?
516268,brifishrgy,2010-10-31 01:44:00,559,"guess your right, here is a listing I found for the areas and what they have in em, looks like carp is the only fish listed  urban fishing"
