Excellent water levels with emerald color,my fav..Fished mornings and evenings but the real bite was happening mid day in high sun. Mostly larger fish weighing in between 5 and 10 pounds. Fly of choice of course was the purple bugger with blue crystal flash which I appropriately named the ""Purple Haze""Thanks Jimmy    All in all over the weekend I went 12 for 14. One fish broke me off in the timber and the other tossed the fly after an amazing jump and mid air head shake. Heres a couple of pics...   One for the smoker     "
