515156,bassdreamer,2010-10-27 09:32:00,128,Holy sheepeeeeeeee ! Congrats Aaron !!
515191,Toddyc20,2010-10-27 14:53:00,141,Outstanding fish you caught there.  Congrats on the record.
515416,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-28 01:46:00,655,"Thanks again for the comments guys. Thanks for the play-by-play and additional photos from your camera Bunk. That is pretty close to how I remember it, although I would have remembered fondue and the drum spitting out a musky lol.  In all the excitement, I'm not sure if you or Tony netted it, but it was a good team effort to clear lines, stop the boat and net that bad boy. Thanks!  A day to remember for all three of us for sure  Aaron"
515460,Ron,2010-10-28 02:50:00,1683,"""I've caught bigger""  :whistling:                                Nice Sheepie Aaron!"
515464,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-28 02:58:00,655, Did you hook yourself in the arse Ron?
515489,Moosebunk,2010-10-28 05:28:00,3970, Tony's Black Rhino was the vessel... I grabbed it in the net starboard but we swung it around to the port and both pulled it on up.  Heavy lamb.
515514,limeyangler,2010-10-28 12:06:00,5204,"Thats a monster, congrats whoever you are!"
516566,Whopper,2010-11-01 12:47:00,2174,"  I saw that mister, it's a title I'd glady give up  That is a real bruiser"
514804,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 00:01:00,655,"RippinLips, we were fishing for walleye in the Adolphus Reach area of the Bay of Quinte when we caught the big drum. It was caught on 5 colour leadcore with a stickbait.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
514805,kickingfrog,2010-10-26 00:04:00,8333,Those are excelent photos of a monster fish. Congradulations.  My brother and my cousin both had caught drum in the '80s (Lake Nipissing) that would have broken the record which was 14bs at the time. They were nowhere near the size of that monster.
514806,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-26 00:04:00,2690,"Aaron, my 17.4 lber fought like a devil, checking the pics it took me about 8 minutes to get it in, I can imagine how that thing pulled!!  Who said ""sheepies"" aren't a sportfish?!"
514808,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 00:05:00,655,"Thanks everyone. It was one heck of a fish to say the least.  Rick, we were fishing in Tony`s boat. Viral... ya never know, but it`s a drum, not a musky lol."
514811,bigfish1965,2010-10-26 00:11:00,3382," Aaron..it is clearly the largest drum ever caught. No matter what the species, a record is a record. If we can look forward to big drum like that, more people will definitely be targeting them!"
514812,bucktail,2010-10-26 00:13:00,1857,Thats one giant grunt!!! They fight like mad so that must have been a HANDFULl!!! See you guys were WAY down the reach as well!  Congrats!
514813,OhioFisherman,2010-10-26 00:14:00,6623,"Dang, I thought it was a Lake Erie fish."
514814,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-26 00:17:00,70,Sheepheads are awesome ! They fight like theres no tomorow ! Great catch !!  hope we know who u are soon
514823,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 00:53:00,655,"Rick, agreed. A record is a record, and that is why I am dissapointed with myself that I didn`t keep it to weigh on an official scale. Oh well, can`t worry about it, just enjoy the moment.  There are a lot of big drum up to 15lbs caught while fishing for walleye in the reach. Tony got 2 that went about 15lbs over the weekend, with several drum over 10lbs (watch for my Quinte report soon). They fight much harder than walleye, and keep us entertained well between walleye bites"
514825,mercman,2010-10-26 01:14:00,7054,  we DO know who he is
514827,BillM,2010-10-26 01:31:00,17367,I can't get over the size of that thing!!!  Way to go Aaron!  It almost looks fake it's so big!
514831,Joey,2010-10-26 01:57:00,9122,Good God that is a huge Drum.  Congratulations bud!!!  Joey
514832,ehg,2010-10-26 01:57:00,2666,An incredible fish! Maybe this will give catching sheepshead a more favourable viewpoint.
514833,MJL,2010-10-26 02:01:00,2427,"Aaron entered Tony’s boat for a good day of fishing on the BOQ.  Aaron said, “Tony, see that Lowrance colour fish finder with side imaging technology...I invented that”  “But do they call me a revolutionary, technological, fishing genius?  No...”  Then Aaron gestured over to the wide expanse of Lake O and said, “1 mile out, I rescued another fisherman whose boat was capsizing along with his wife, 6 kids, 2 dogs and next door neighbour.”  Aaron continued, “Do they call me a hero?  No...”  Then Aaron said to Tony, “See how the regulations for walleye now protect the prime spawners unlike before?  I was the head lobbyist and at the forefront for all of that”  “But am I known for my groundbreaking conservation efforts?  No...”  Aaron looks around nervously, then whispers to Tony  “But you get one huge sheephead to suck up your worm and put a bend in your rod...”   Congrats Aaron"
514843,frozen-fire,2010-10-26 02:17:00,542,Congratulations Aaron!  That sheepshead looks ridiculous. Beautiful!
514876,GBW,2010-10-26 03:48:00,8460,And you are a sheeps-header for life!  LOL!
514927,Rod Caster,2010-10-26 13:54:00,5784,  Sheep-header or sheep hearder?
514960,Spiel,2010-10-26 15:36:00,9065,"  Congratulations Aaron, that's a tank!  Any chance on approximating the measurements? Would make an awesome replica."
514965,bigfish1965,2010-10-26 15:56:00,3382,I will pull it into photoshop and should be able to figure it there...
514967,bigfish1965,2010-10-26 16:23:00,3382,"Using standard measurement tools (ie first to fourth knuckle on average man =3 inches) and using that for scale, I get 36 inches in length. Using girth=2.5x width=26 inches.  36X26 inches Using those measurements on a few fish weight calculators, I get a weight between 28 and 30 pounds...so this is likely close."
514990,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 17:47:00,655,"That is pretty cool Rick, thanks for the approximate length and girth. I doubt anyone will have a replica with those measurements though.  Sheep hearder... Nice lol"
515115,Crazyhook,2010-10-27 01:47:00,1154,What a great fish Aaron! Congrats
515148,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-27 04:36:00,3761,
515151,Moosebunk,2010-10-27 06:10:00,3970,"The fight went...  Aaron takes a port side rod which goes screaming.... the fish ends up back at 660 last we know of it before Tony takes another rod that fires starboard.  I'm eating some delish Fondue and passing gas, but am forced to clear three lines.  Tony lands his sheepie...    ... then we clear the last line, enjoy some more delish Fondue and a Black Forest cake from Timmies, and pop the boat in neutral to wait for ole Aaron to quit showboating.  Aaron's fish is staying down but finally it surfaces like a whale, spits out a 36-inch muskie and is in the net.  The rest becomes his official (between us all and those who matter) Ontario record.  The End.      "
515155,alphaalpha,2010-10-27 09:19:00,475,"wow that is insane, congrats to you guys!"
514692,Muskieman,2010-10-25 18:11:00,2472,Now I'm not gonna divulge the identity of our potential Record Holder.... You're gonna have to wait for his post  The current record is 22.2 and this specimen is 27.5  Can you guess who this is??    Randy 
514696,walleyemen,2010-10-25 18:16:00,316,I'm going to say Arron!!!lol
514712,tknohpy,2010-10-25 18:49:00,162,I heard about this fish on the weekend

514741,tdotfisherman,2010-10-25 20:26:00,317,Unreal! congrats.
514747,mistaredone,2010-10-25 21:08:00,913,Holy crap!!!  I had no idea they got over 10lbs.  Congrats on the potential record fish!!!!
514749,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-25 21:12:00,0,Incredible!!! I would have loved to catch that fish!!!!
514754,Handlebarz,2010-10-25 21:20:00,3790,Dang that must have been a great fight I guess Phil is no longer the sheepshead master but he can still catch them.  Congrats on the monster stone head
514755,dave524,2010-10-25 21:21:00,4508,"Awesome, that is actually a nice looking sheepie. Seems so many of the larger ones have lesions, cysts tumours, incredibly clean looking for its immense size, perfect fins and a nice colour too."
514757,Rich Clemens,2010-10-25 21:29:00,3131,"Sweet.  Nothing like ""shattering"" a record."
514763,Leecher,2010-10-25 21:41:00,7832,Have no clue who it is Randy but congratulations to the potential record holder     Very healthy looking Leechman
514765,SlowPoke,2010-10-25 21:45:00,2984,"I hope you kept it for a skin mount, I don't think too many taxidermists will have a 27lb sheephead replica! Congrats."
514767,Rod Caster,2010-10-25 21:52:00,5784,"I just went off soft!!! I caught some 10lbers from Nipissing and I thought those were big...but man, this thing is ridiculous!!!"
514770,HTHM,2010-10-25 21:57:00,4082,That is one BBBAAAAAAd fish! Whomever it is CONGRADS!!!!!!
514772,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-25 22:00:00,1107,nice
514775,spincast,2010-10-25 22:15:00,3279,That's a monster - be interested to know how'd they got it in the boat without swamping it !
514787,Gregoire,2010-10-25 23:00:00,1397,Wow...what a beast.
514791,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-10-25 23:08:00,76,Wow...cant wait to hear the story.   What was he actually fishing for when he caught that thing ??
514793,Jigger,2010-10-25 23:29:00,1237,I had no idea those fish got to that size. Incredible! Congrats to the lucky angler!!!
514798,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-25 23:46:00,655,"Didn't take long for some of you to guess correctly lol. Yes, I am the one who caught the 27.5 pound freshwater drum.  I caught it trolling with fellow OFNers TonyB and Bunk in Adolphus Reach at the Bay of Quinte on Saturday October 23rd. It just happened to be my turn at a rod when the giant hit. We had a triple header at the time, and my fish peeled line like a salmon! We slowed the boat down to a crawl, but I still wasn't making much headway. The fish was just staying deep and heavy, and every once in a while peeled line again. Bunk cleared lines and stopped the boat after his fish was in so Tony (fighting another good drum) and I could get our fish in.  My fish still fought hard and had me wondering what the heck I had on, thinking it may be a salmonid.  When my fish finally breached the water's surface near the boat, all three of us yelled ""whoooooaaaaaaaa"" at the same time. It was really a sight to behold. I forget who netted it in all the excitement, but thanks to both of you on the team work to help me get my fish in!  We weighed the fish a couple of times on Tony's Rapala digital scale to make sure the exact weight. It was exactly 27.5 pounds. We didn't know if it was a record fish or not, and I held it in the water while Tony tried to find out what the record was on his Blackberry. He found a 54lb drum as a world record, and I ended up releasing the fish. We didn't even get measurements, as Tony didn't have a tape on his boat. I wondered about what the Canadian or Ontario record was, and after talking to some buddies on the radio, realized it could have been at least an Ontario record.  I'm not sure if it would have been a Canadian record or not (can't find any info on Canadian record fish), but it would have shattered the Ontario record had I kept it.  I really didn't realize just what I let go until after. I was still trying to confirm if it was an Ontario or Canadian record today, and still am about the Canadian record. I know it really doesn`t matter as I let the fish go, but it would just be nice to know for sure. I really wish that I had kept the fish now, and feel bad I didn`t.  Even though it will not be an official record, the three of us know what we put in the boat and Tony`s scale is accurate. It was a true giant fish that put up an unbelievable fight. TonyB, Bunk and I will always have the photos of our special day on the water, and the memories will last a lifetime.  I`ll post a seperate report with some details about our weekend Quinte trip. Thanks for the suspence Randy lol.  Here are pics of the beast.     "
514800,bigfish1965,2010-10-25 23:55:00,3382,"That is bloody insane!! It is a freakishly big fish. When you put it on Facebook I was wondering what it would look like. Must be Tony's boat...JewelBee and I had out best outing together ever with him .  Awesome fish!! Now this will be viral soon, I bet."
514802,I'mHooked,2010-10-25 23:59:00,525,"Man, we were catching 12-14 pounders out of Picton last weekend and they put up a fight! I can't imagine one the size of yours!  Nice catch!"
