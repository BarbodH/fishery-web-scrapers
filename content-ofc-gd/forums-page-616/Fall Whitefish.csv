516560,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-01 12:27:00,0,Read the regs for where you plan on fishing for them. It's spawning time. They usually come in shallow around the first time the snow starts to fly and can be caught with skeen or a roe bag.   good luck.
516651,John the Fisherman,2010-11-01 17:05:00,45,"I believe that you can still use a dip net.  At least you used to be able to.  Not up on many regs around here, but I know you had to purchase a permit to net white fish from MNR in the past.  They are running now around here.  Some friends and I got 60 on Sat. night.  Filleted some, gutted some to smoke, and gave a few away. JTF"
516710,Terry,2010-11-01 20:04:00,14456,"in our area there is a strick 2 fish limit but are OOS right now, so it depends on the regs. for his area"
516825,singingdog,2010-11-02 10:37:00,1047, What zone are you in? Every zone I look up has a year-round whitefish season.
516830,canadadude,2010-11-02 11:16:00,769,I beleive that would be Lake Simcoe
516847,John the Fisherman,2010-11-02 13:49:00,45,"Zone 11, All Year, Poss. of 12.  Forgot to check about the net permit."
516848,irishfield,2010-11-02 13:55:00,26272,You can keep 25 on the lake John.. it's in the exceptions. I don't have my reg book here to see about dip netting.
516850,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-02 14:00:00,0,"  A limit used to be 25 on the bay as well as places like bernard. They lowered it to 12 and there are exceptions like Simcoe where it is closed this time of year.  Gotta check those ""exceptions"""
516857,John the Fisherman,2010-11-02 14:21:00,45,Dip net as well as sien use from Oct.1 - Dec.15.
