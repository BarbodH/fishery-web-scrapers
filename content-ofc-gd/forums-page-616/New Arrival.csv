516337,JohnF,2010-10-31 13:59:00,3494,Good choice. I got the 46 incher (same model) a year ago and love it. Had a warrantee issue with a screen component (a small flaw in the image) but they did a great job of dealing with it. At first I was a little ticked when the dealer told me I had to contact a special warrantee department but he gave me an email to use and I almost immediately got a phone call from a pleasant and knowledgable feller. The guy asked me to send digipics of the screen problem if I could. I got a message back within 24 hours saying the parts had been shipped and repairs were arranged and the local service rep would be contacting me to do an in house fix. All done within 48 hours. I was impressed. Worked flawlessly since.  JF
516403,Bill Shearer,2010-10-31 19:11:00,456,Nice Dave Will we have to turn the TV off to run the coffee machine next fall? Or will there be a new genny as well?
