516399,Pikeslayer,2010-10-31 18:51:00,1443,"@Fisher12, I think it is obvious that you are developing a passion for fishing. Congratulations. Also, I see that you are trying to get as much knowledge as you can, as fast as you can. Your enthusiasm is admirable. That said, you have joined this forum seeking answers & advice so here goes.........  So, good luck to you 'Young Angler'. I'm sure there are a few people here keeping an eye on you. Stay courteous and respectful (as you have so far), update your profile and maybe you may get a few invitations to spend some time on the water and fuel your passion.  Regards, Pikeslayer"
516410,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-31 19:34:00,1622,"Spinnerbaits any colour but White, Chartruese & Orange/purple are likely my favorites for Pike & a variety of Sizes but 1/2 oz would be good to start with,then likely a Super Spot, Strike King Red Eye type lure would be next, this year I did very well with Bass Magnet 5"" Swim Baits also, Perch colour would be my 1st choose Richard"
516437,irishfield,2010-10-31 21:34:00,26272," He may also be 59 years old and trolling. It wouldn't be the first time around here in the last 6 years or more, that's for sure!"
516452,mercman,2010-10-31 22:47:00,7054,"  Ya,i know, but if i start thinking that way, i may as well admit to myself that Santa isn`t real,and the easter bunny buys all those eggs he delivers. And life wouldn`t be fun anymore."
516491,adempsey,2010-11-01 01:55:00,1498,"Pike - any large silver spoon. I prefer Johnson's Silver Minnow (with white grub trailer), Williams Whitefish, Williams Wabler, Lucky Strike Red Flash.   I also enjoy using pike flies with a spin bubble.  Big pike hunters often recommend using a Suick.  Walleye - jig and white or pink grub (I like Yum and Gary Yamamoto), worm on a harness, slow death hook, lindy rig or bottom bouncer.  Don't really need much else for inland lake walleyes.  If I use cranks I use Storm Hot'n'Tots, Storm Thinfins, Rapala ShadRaps, Berkley Frenzy Flicker Shad [in the summer]; and minnow stick baits in the fall (Smithwicks Rogue, Bomber Long A)."

513719,irishfield,2010-10-21 21:35:00,26272,All you need in the credit is a marshmellow...  ..just sayin.
513722,mercman,2010-10-21 21:54:00,7054, no one has axed so im gonna. How old are ya anyways we need to know if we should watch our language or not

513783,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-22 01:55:00,0,  it was long ago....  Was either that or.....well...never mind....  I only gave life lessons....  and rightly so.
513784,GBW,2010-10-22 01:57:00,8460,"Not me.  I sure don't as I gave the best advise I could.  That was ""go to a shop you ARE going to purchase from and ask for info and they may give you pointers/spots too"" or something close to that.  I stand by my words.  If fisher12 was to go to walmart he/she would learn 0 from them.  If he/she goes to ""local tackle shop"" he/she would learn what to use and when and where in the area.  Just saying..."
513790,mercman,2010-10-22 02:17:00,7054,"  sure its not aimed at you GBW.that was good advice.but if you look back you will see me laffin at a silly remark by someone. then i got to thinkin that maybe this kid really loves to fish and needs some guidance.thats why i asked his age and gender so we would know who we were dealing with.I dont know, he sounds like a little guy who would be tickled pink to go fishing with one of you guys in his area some day."
513802,GBW,2010-10-22 03:11:00,8460,"I know it wasn't a shot at me and if it was then the 'shot taker' needs to wake up and re-read the whole post.  In fact, if fisher12 and his folks are close to me and I can get them out fishing the the offer is open.  Provided I can get out (problem 1 right now is boat boats are put to be for the season).  The BEST advise I can give is this.  Use a darter jig and a 4"" grub in a natural colour for ANY and ALL decent size fish.  Then again, if they have a boat and want to get out and or shore fish in my area it's a whole new game..."
513808,curlrap,2010-10-22 03:43:00,58,"GBW, i wasn't taken a shot at you at all, but don't worry i'm still up and very alert. Go back to page 1 and read gb fisher's comments and let me know what you think."
513827,skunked,2010-10-22 11:19:00,41,"Funny, True, But we don't want to be starting anyone off with bad habits! fisher12 DO not use a marshmellow. if your fishing the credit, grab a wolly bugger or bead head wolly bugger, in black brown green, maybe a stone fly or two, that will be good all fall winter spring, and in the summer for bass.. and all along I wasnt going to say a thing"
513828,skunked,2010-10-22 11:22:00,41,well he (fisher12)could be 30 for all we know... just saying..

513834,kevin booth,2010-10-22 12:14:00,57,"fisher, for pike i use rapalas a mix of colours and from floating to deep diving models.you can cast them from shore and troll them as well.i use a 7ft med action rod and spin reel with 50lbs power pro line and 7ft floralcarbon leader 25lbs.they work for walleye as well,i use jigs for walleye with mr twister tail in differnt colours,walleye love twister tails and you can also tip them with berkley shad minnows.assorted colours for jig heads 3/8 to 3/4.the same rod and reel and line will work but step down to 12 lbs leader line."

The mods are aware of who they are too. And in any case, its the mods job to weed these guys out. For any newbie or minnow reading this, if you are serious about learning about fishing, the more info you give us about yourself, ie age, if you already fish a bit, if you've never fished,what kind of equipment you have, etc, will help us to help you to the best of our ability. Because, after all, that is what we are here for, RIGHT GUYS AND GALS. fisher12, now you see why i asked your age and if you were a dude or dudette  Now you are gonna get the respect you deserve buddy !!!! fish on my little fishin dude, fish on. i like spinners with real worms. just dont like it when the worm poops on me.  "
513880,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 14:05:00,5784,Fisher12 if you are thinking of fishing the Kawarthas for walleye...consider bucktail jigs (jig heads with hair on them). they work well in the weeds as most kawartha lakes are quite weedy.
513892,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-22 14:53:00,1107,Hi Fisher12 here's a blog I wrote about pike lures I wrote it based on Long point bay but these lures will work anywere .  http://www.wfn.tv/ambassador/admin/content/preview.php?content=404270   as for a rod/reel for pike I would suggest you get a 7' medium heavy so you can use it for other species also and a good 3000 size reel you don't need a really exspensive set up to start with but the $20 combo's from wallmart are not gonna last very long if your targeting pike .You live real close to some really good spring pike fishing and hopefully some of the other members here will help you out with some spots (I have never fished TO pike ) to get you started in the spring just keep reading and researching all winter and you will get into some pike this spring .I don't target walters so I can't help ya there . Good luck .
513438,fisher12,2010-10-20 21:22:00,81,"Which are the best lure/ baits for pike and walleye?(please be specific as to size and colours, which line do you use them on)"

Everyone has their own lure that works for them and not others  Hey fisher12....haven't you received enough info as to what works best and put any of that info to good use as of yet? I'd be interested in seeing you produce a fish with the vast amount of knowledge you have gained from all these ""what's best questions"".... ....or is your next question, what's the best equipment to buy for,  Musky, Pike, Bass, Trout, Salmon, Pan fish and just about every kind of fish that swims in a lake or ocean.   Try a stick. Everyone should learn how to use a stick. Caught my biggest fish to date with a stick.   "
513466,fisher12,2010-10-20 23:04:00,81,"  (what's the best equipment to buy for, Musky, Pike, Bass, Trout, Salmon, Pan fish) I already asked that lol with no many replies though. limited input from you also."
513469,GBW,2010-10-20 23:12:00,8460,"to be honest, best bet is to GO to a local tackle shop that you ARE going to buy from and ask for help.  You never know, they may tell you a spot ro 2 to try as well..."
513471,GBW,2010-10-20 23:14:00,8460,"what kind of stick was it?  Ugly Stick, Carrot Stick, Maple Stick?"

513501,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-21 00:04:00,0,  solid oak stick.
513502,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-21 00:05:00,0," the info although limited, was the best by far if you ask me.  My father always told me to stop 'asking' and 'Do' for a change.....I'm glad I did."
513540,fisher12,2010-10-21 02:20:00,81," Well unfortunately i'm not like you, I can't go fishing whenever I feel like. I go to school."
513541,fisher12,2010-10-21 02:20:00,81, Thank you.
513547,Governator,2010-10-21 02:38:00,879,"You should probably read a book first before asking these types of questions.  At least gain some knowledge on fishing Pike first.  Different times of year, different bodies of water & different weather conditions all play a role with what types of lures to be throwing.  I guess a generic response for pike could be 50lb power pro, and Rapala HJ14."
513548,Kwan,2010-10-21 02:39:00,132,"Thanks for the worm vid- from now on i'm using two worms, or threading the whole thing into the line if i can  edit: i'm using two hooks not two worms lol"
513551,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-21 02:42:00,70,"I'll tell you with my experiences what is the best lure for pike and/or walleye ... Of course my advice you can't base it on what your gonna experience because every lake is different and every day is different i'm not in your boat to tell you what to do... But if you like trolling for Walleye and pike i'd go with the cotton cordell Ripplin redfin ! I've basicly caught all species of fish on this lure and has never let me down. For pike it's my number 1 bait for numbers. I've caught tons of fish with this. If you like jigging just use a 1/4oz to 3/8 oz roundhead jig with a small 2"" or so minnow ( dace if possible ) for walleye and you can catch the odd pike with it too  But when using a jig i would tie it directly to the line with no leader or swivel its the best way with about 8 lbs test line  on a spinning outfit  if u catch the odd pike u could get broken off the odd time but i still caught a 35"" pike using this method of fishing for walleye tho actually lol And for the ripplin redfin if your gonna cast or troll use a 20lbs braid for a spinning reel or about a 50lbs braid with a baitcaster and use a Flurocarbon leader made out of leader material not line!!!! make sure its leader material!!!  HAPPY FISHING!"
513554,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-21 02:56:00,0, If that had any truth to it. I would have been fishing tomorrow. Missing a day here and a day there for school can be made up. If you want to learn how to fish you have to take the time. If you are only in school it would be easier for you to set aside the time to fish. It's what happens after that slows ya down..... So when can we expect to see some progress in the fishing department with all this prime info being handed to you?  Is that gonna be next months topic?
513557,Kwan,2010-10-21 04:02:00,132, 
513570,fisher12,2010-10-21 11:58:00,81," Well, for the winter I'm not going to go ice fishing. So until Spring I will go after bass and steelhead, then pike and others on the summer."
513575,steverowbotham,2010-10-21 12:11:00,1800," Not sure where you're from, but bass season is closed in the spring in Southern Ontario"
513576,dave524,2010-10-21 12:11:00,4508,"I've probably caught more Walleyes trolling a "" Canadian Wiggler"" than any other lure over the past 50 years. Originally the silver one piece style but since I troll Erie for eyes the last twenty years I like the jointed, chartreuse/green two tone or the Five of Diamonds in yellow red spots, they handle the higher speeds well that I use on Erie eyes and you can sweeten then up with a piece of crawler on the front treble. Probably caught the most pike on larger sized Mepp's spinners, but I don't fish pike often."
513579,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-21 12:37:00,0,"  No ice fishing? There's another 100.... thousand questions to ask about what to use and when and for what. I'd think yer thesis on how to fish could be that much better if you included a couple hundred more pages. From what I am reading you already know fishing year round is endless and there is always something biting. You still have lots of time till ice starts. Lots of Crappy, Perch, Rainbows, browns and pickerel until then. Oh and of course Musky and pike.  Geeessss....all this talk.  ..I'm gonna set aside Friday to go fishing.  "
513582,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-21 13:03:00,2582, Yep. That is 100% correct.  Once school is done and you enter the working world...fishing time goes way down. Way way down.
513588,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-21 13:34:00,3761,"I tend to stick to spoons and spinnerbaits when it comes to Pike fishing in the spring time. 15lb Fluorocarbon line never get's cut through by pike with me so no need for leaders and such. Pick up some double willow, blade spinnerbaits in white and redish colors as well as silver or gold spoons. Remember weed growth is very seldom in May when Pike open so you can really slow roll spinnerbaits with those big willow blades on them.  Pick up some trailer hooks to for the spinnerbaits.  MTBF"
513590,rufus,2010-10-21 13:47:00,267,"  For years those have been my two favourite lures as well. I like the Canadian Wiggler - especially the ""newer"" hammered silver rattler model. Works for Walleye, Pike, and even Bass. I also like the Mepp's spinners for Pike and Bass although it doesn't seem to work as well in the fall.  The last couple of years the Rapala Clackin' Rap #8 has been inching towards the # 1 spot for Pike and Walleye though.  The line I use depends on the rod I am using and what I am fishing for. I like Power Pro braid but on a heavy or medium heavy action rod it will tear the hooks right out of a fish's mouth if the drag is not set properly.  Where I fish, pike will really bite on just about anything that moves though...."
513596,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-21 14:38:00,957,"NWO, I'd like to know what water you're fishing so we could better answer your questions."
