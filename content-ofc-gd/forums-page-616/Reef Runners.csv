512135,Cosmos,2010-10-15 19:14:00,588,"Hey Jimmer,  Which one are you mostly use? I never used them before. i saw full bunch of them in BPS. Thanks."
512136,jimmer,2010-10-15 19:18:00,2730,"Haven't used them before.  I heard that they work well in deeper water, so I wanted to try them.  I was looking for the 800 series. BPS is a little far for me to drive to buy a couple of lures.  It's just too dangerous to go into that store without dropping mega bucks."
512140,Hooked,2010-10-15 19:31:00,891,"When you are heading up there, check the CT in Kingston.  I know their fishing selection was like no other CT I have seen in my life.  Actually was quite impressed and better than alot of tackle stores I have gone to.  But I don't recall if they sold Reef Runners.  Might be worth a check? Baker's in Nappannee may have some, but I doubt it, he usually sell's his own home-made cranks."
512143,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-15 19:44:00,2690,"http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/   Huge selection of Reef Runners, if you can stop in on your way.  Try purples and blues."
512146,Hooked,2010-10-15 19:49:00,891,"  Damn, I didn't know about that place!  Thx Frankie.  Looks like you're set Jimmer!"
512148,jimmer,2010-10-15 19:58:00,2730,Nice! Thanks
512155,Ron,2010-10-15 20:16:00,1683,Stacey has a HUGE selection in stock now. Prices are good too.
512175,fish_fishburn,2010-10-15 22:29:00,1311,"Hey Frankie, I think Jimmer is targeting walleye not sheeps. Stay away from the purple and blues jimmer. Try taildancers too they work for me"
512178,Cudz,2010-10-15 22:43:00,2652,Go to toplak's tackle and get them sent to you.  Great prices and only $3.50 for shipping.  I bought 4 from him this month. http://www.toplakstackle.com/
512185,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-15 23:08:00,2690," Oh, walleyes..."
516463,bassnass,2010-10-31 23:56:00,174,"Yeah man - I'd have to say, on-line is the way to go.  There's always a better selection and you can almost always find exactly what you want.  Yeah, there's shipping, and a wait.  But I think it's the way to go, a lot of the time."
516466,tknohpy,2010-11-01 00:33:00,162,Pro Tackle also has custom colours you won't find anywhere else
516483,bassnass,2010-11-01 01:20:00,174,Just checked out Protackle - nifty stuff. Thanks for the 411.
