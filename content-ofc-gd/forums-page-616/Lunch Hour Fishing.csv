Instead of going to McDonalds or cooking up a pot of KD, I grabbed the only two rods I had rigged up, a crankbait and dropshot, and headed down to the bay. With 50k winds out of the West, I was throwing my deep diving crankbait off a point but had nothing to show for it. I moved to the calm side of the point and threw my dropshot about 20ft from shore into 15fow. I let is sit on taught line and gave if a couple jiggles. I had a very light tap and set the hook on this ugly little thing!          http://www.flickr.com/photos/photocentric/"

515682,jimmer,2010-10-28 20:55:00,2730,Looks like it ripped off a stringer.  Just goes to show that some fish can take a beating and keep on swimming.
