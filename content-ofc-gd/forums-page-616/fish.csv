516255,Kwan,2010-10-31 00:21:00,132," same spot, much less people, but it was still a tangle fest at times   somebody else caught a ~7lb earlier, and nonstop catfishaction makes it pretty fun haha.  hopefully I'll get an eye like that sometime too  thx for the replies.  somebody also lost a carp that looked like those giant goliath bass 600 lb video on youtube-esque fish.  his knot broke as i was trying to net it, but quite honestly it wouldnt fit ..  he got it close to shore pretty quick, it woulda been something if he was able to land it as i see the ontario record is 39 pounds.  absolute beast the size of a table ... on a micro tube fishing for crappie 	jaw-dropping"
