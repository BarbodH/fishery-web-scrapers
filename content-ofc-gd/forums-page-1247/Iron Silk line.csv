51153,Zib,2007-03-24 04:10:00,369,Hopefully Berkley improved it but after I bought it when it 1st came out I swore I'd never buy it again. Cheap line at K-Mart was better than that stuff.
51168,PatrickGG,2007-03-24 04:47:00,562,I use 8 pound test Ironsilk for fishing smallies and i never had a problem with it but i had the occasional break off but that was my fault i would forget to check my line for abrasions.
51181,Northhunter,2007-03-24 06:13:00,214,"I spooled up with it a few times when it first came out and thought it was a great.. until it went bad on the reel and my 8lb morphed into 2lb. The sun seemed to get to it fast - that's the only thing I can figure happened as it decayed like mono would but only after a month or two of light use.  I noticed the ""new and improved"" stuff last year and my first thought was they must have fixed it, but I haven't tried it yet."
