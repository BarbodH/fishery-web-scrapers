50813,tonyb,2007-03-23 12:59:00,1637,"Hahaha!  I have an ice fishing rod setup that I use for catfishing in the house  I use a uni-knot tied to a catnip mouse toy (no hooks required) and I found the best presentation is a quick, erratic retrieve or the famous twitch, twitch...pause  Tony  (No cats were harmed during catfishing episodes)"
50821,Headhunter,2007-03-23 13:28:00,5703,"Tony, try a flippin stick on your cat! It's great! When presented properly, I was able to get my cat to jump a coupla feet in the air, using a flippin stick and the technique you described! It aint like being on the water, but can sure help pass the long winter away! The cat liked it so much, I had to hide the rod, as he would sit beside it and cry until I picked it up! HH"
50831,tonyb,2007-03-23 13:49:00,1637,Hehehe I've got the cat jumping in the air too! she does a big jump with her front legs stretched way out like a big Y trying to catch the mouse.  She knows the sound of the drag coming off the reel means playtime.  I just pull about a foot of line off the reel and she comes running  Good times...  Tony
