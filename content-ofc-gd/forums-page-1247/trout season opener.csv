50658,huntervasili,2007-03-22 21:56:00,1604,"How many fly fishers, river/stream fishermen are waiting to hit the water in 5 weeks and 2 days? I know I cant wait and will be on whitemans both days.... How bout you all? Cant wait to put out a nice report beatiful water out paris way..."
50673,urbanangler1990,2007-03-22 22:36:00,933,"i think its better to fish earlier like now, in those alowed zones, to me openers just bring headache from crowds and crowds of fisherman..."
50677,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 22:42:00,1780,"I use to love opener, the crowds are getting bigger every year but I've met a lot of new friends that way, still fun."
50698,canadian_copper,2007-03-22 23:41:00,925,i never go out on opener for the past 5or 6 yrs!!!! way too many people who dont have the slightest clue what there doin!!! and way to many meathunters for my liking!!! i fished a spot once and down stream there was about 20guys fishin 1 pool!!!about an hr into opener 2 of them walked by me with a wheel barrel loaded with trout!!1 pushed the barrel and the other picked the fish up as they fell out!!!now i understand 20guys at 5 fish per guy is within there legal limit but just the site of it turned me off openers!!  i'll keep the cold months too myself just the way i like it  lol
50738,fishdawg,2007-03-23 02:09:00,912,i always fish trout opener............ on the big lake    where there is lotsa room to share with everyone
50746,huntervasili,2007-03-23 02:36:00,1604,"Well if you get private access you are set, which I am quite sure i can get... there is lots of river and just being out there is worth it."
50757,charlied,2007-03-23 03:31:00,584,Well who says you have to fish a big stream for rainbows.....I myself go to a small creek and fish little specks with an ultra light and get over a hundred per person and lose tons more.  Its fun to take someone who doesn't fish much or catch much!  And there is barely anyone around!
50789,ccmtcanada,2007-03-23 11:38:00,7971,"I've never experienced a trout opener on the tribs before, so I'm sure I'll be one of the 20 guys standing around one pool....LOL.  If I knew of other places to go other than the standard popular ones, I'd head off there, but alas, I'm relegated to the usual spots.  I'm not complaining...I just gotta get out there and do my homework."
50794,silveradosheriff,2007-03-23 11:50:00,1025,Lake 'X'.
50797,MJL,2007-03-23 12:13:00,2427,"I happen to fish one of the busiest rivers in Ontario on the opener.  More of a tradition really but even with the crowds I always enjoy myself spending time with my dad.  If crowds aren't your think, whip out the fly rod and sling a cone-head bugger or clouser minnow out wildly.  Crowds disipate quite quickly"
50798,iMetal,2007-03-23 12:16:00,11,"I think the best fishing will be in the next week..perfect temps, water conditions should be perfect.  Opening day is just an excuse for a BBQ!  LOL"
50818,tonyb,2007-03-23 13:11:00,1637,"Lots of places to fish where there are fewer people.  The rivermouths of a lot of the major tributaries will attract both salmon and trout that are feeding on baitfish that congregate in those areas.  You can get into some good numbers and variety of species as well.  The opener in the popular creeks is pretty hectic, you need to try to get a few fish early before they are spooked by 'deep-waders' (people who walk into pools up to their armpits trying to make drifts)  Tony"
50984,huntervasili,2007-03-23 20:49:00,1604,"C.C fishing opener is not an excuse to have a BBQ... It is ILLEGAL to fish for trout next week, no matter what conditions may be... Please make sure to read the issued manuals before fishing any species and body of water so as to be on the safe side..."
50985,huntervasili,2007-03-23 20:51:00,1604,And as a matter of fact you can find lots of not so busy spots for trout... If anyone is wondering about some PM me and I will try to help you out... I am a fly fisherman so I may leave a couple of FFing only spots out but that is for the good of the trout... I always fish for trout Barbless as well and ALWAYS release them unless I am doing some sort of week-long trip...
51007,kemper,2007-03-23 22:03:00,2232,"  Speaking of reading issued manuals, have you read them lately?  I know Ill be fishing for trout next week, just as I have been this week."
51017,solopaddler,2007-03-23 22:25:00,8605,"As much as I love steelhead fishing, the opener will find me paddling in Algonquin Park for brook trout like I do every year (if the ice is out  )"
51019,Mike the Pike,2007-03-23 22:33:00,3421,Season opens here in Quebec on April 27th I will be on Lake Massawippi in the boat for browns lakers and Rainbows on the 28th of April.  I will be fishing for Trout before that in the St.Lawrence River which is open all year round.Right now there is alot of ice floating downstream.  MTP
51176,huntervasili,2007-03-24 05:35:00,1604,Yup... I do read the manuals every year and check em everytime before I go out... Most water is closed at the moment except for certain exceptions in S.O. I was talking about general rules and not exceptions
