50176,young_one,2007-03-21 21:46:00,620,Yum Dinger works just as well Grn w/ white bellie
50216,Dutch,2007-03-21 23:27:00,831,I use Yum Dingers.  Pumpkinseed with chartreuse tip. Purple with grey/silver flecks.
50243,Daplumma,2007-03-22 00:04:00,1961,"Below the mullet line ..pumpkin,white with black flecks and black with purple flex. Joe"
50250,PatrickGG,2007-03-22 00:19:00,562,Yum Dingers: Watermelon red flake and Mardi Gras.
50262,Rattletrap2,2007-03-22 00:31:00,1652,"PINK BUBBLEGUM!!!! Amazing! The watermelon greens with flake work well too. Almost any colour works if you rig them wacky style! And yes, YUM Dingers and the BPS ""Sticko"" brands work every bit as well as the ""Senko"" ones do. There is one called a ""Slurpie"" at BPS that works very well to.  I find Senko's are way too soft. They rip apart very quickly. Awesome bait though!"
50268,Steelcat,2007-03-22 00:35:00,191,"Watermelon with red or green flakes, White, Purple, and Rootbeer color."
50304,Blake,2007-03-22 01:30:00,418,Black
50333,mepps,2007-03-22 02:17:00,1301,white or chartuese
50352,steverowbotham,2007-03-22 02:59:00,1800,www.ghostbaits.com ask for the G-Sticks in Steve's Special!  It will blow you away in any water with perch as main forage.
50363,Zib,2007-03-22 03:27:00,369,Fav Senko is watermelon. Fav slugo/fluke is pink/bubble gum.
50377,gotfish,2007-03-22 04:10:00,53,My faverates are:  Stained water  :  Baby bass ( Green & White )   ---   Bubble Gum   ----    White    -----  Black  Clear Water   :  Watermelon Red Flake    ----    Red shad ( black & red ) ----    Black Red flake  There are so many to chosse from ?? where do you start.  When choosing the two tone baits I try to get the sticks that have two distinct coulor sides ( not the marble effect.)
50448,Hookset,2007-03-22 13:51:00,367,"I use watermelon from time to time but when I need a confidence color it's black all the way. both Largies and smallies seem to love 'em in clear or stained water.  Good Luck,"
51000,urbanangler1990,2007-03-23 21:45:00,933,"cool thnx guys, i have just ordered a bunch!"
51035,pikeie,2007-03-23 23:31:00,380,"i use the strike king 3x zeros, the last a lot longer for me and cost the same price. i use the 5 inch in green pumpkin candy fleck (gold and purple) , watermellon black fleck.  here is a nice smallie i got on one last year one the bass opener weekend http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1174692647"
51059,spanky,2007-03-24 00:10:00,195,"for me, because i hand pour my own i have lots of choices.... i think the ones i have the most confidence in are:  Bubblegum Purple Haze (my own colour---smoke w/2 sizes of purple glitter, 2 sizes of fuschia glitter and pink glitter) Triple Purple (my own again-- violety/purple colour with pearl white and 2 sizes fuschia and 1 size violet grape glitter) Money maker (my own- no salt, no colouring, just silver, gold and platinum flakes, fished wacky with a weighted hook)  Pretty much have alot of confidence in anything that has purple in it... seems to be a great colour for us down here  And i'm hoping my new senko trype bait will work really equally aswell, it's 5.25"" with apx a 2"" paddletail (leave it as is, fork it, or shred it like a tube... new bait for this year  )"
