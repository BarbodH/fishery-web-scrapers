50841,Basskicker,2007-03-23 14:09:00,421,Well after looking at the forecast....I couldn't resist calling in sick and going fishing.  I haven't taken a day off at work in months....that's how I justified it to myself....hehehe. I never got to the river until 11:00 A.M. and it wasn't completely blown out...the water looked perfect.  Not 10 seconds after I get to the river I hear the thunder....within 5 minutes it poured...and blew....and poured some more. Oh well better than being at work.  Within the first 15 minutes I hooked into these    A couple hours later my good buddy showed up and we got a few more before the river blew out.      We lost a few more....but it was sure nice to feel that spring  in the air.....finally  Jason

I checked a few local tribs around 730pm last night...completely blown out....didn't even bother putting a line in the water.  This work thing sure does get in the way doesn't it?  LOL.  Good on you for heading out...great results!
