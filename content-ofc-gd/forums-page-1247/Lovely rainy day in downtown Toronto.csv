Saw a couple boats braving the waves while driving along LakeShore Blvd and saw several people fishing as well.   Everyone had the same result as me (before I left anyways).  As you can see there is still some ice out there   Here is the only thing I've caught.  Imagine my excitment while reeling this baby in.  Uber piece of ice ><  Tomorrow I might go to King's Mill Park.  Never been there before, but I guess a little adventure will be kinda fun."

51267,tbayboy,2007-03-24 17:54:00,1497,I took a little peek over at frenchmans bay today with the same results - still lots of ice and miserable rainy cold weather so that didn't last too long.
