When I started, it was hard to find stick baits in the tackle shops and you pretty much had to go with the Senko. Now I find there are good performing alternatives to the orignial Senko stick bait, but from my perspective it all started with Gary Yamamoto.  So now I see the ""swimming senko"" in the Cabelas fishing catalogue and since we are still quite far away from opener I have no choice but to simply speculate. My preference would be to just try them out.  Anybody out there try them? If so, how did you rig it, and what do you think? Also, I am wondering if they are as soft as the stick baits?  Thanks... Guidedog"

51324,spanky,2007-03-24 20:58:00,195,"local shop here has them, not sure how they perform any differently then a regular swimbait with a paddletail like that, i understand how/why the originals work... i don't konw, maybe try it with a hybrid retrieve of part jerk bait with long pauses?  I guess down south the tackle shops aren't selling them like they thought they would... but hey, what works for some may not for others and vice-a-versa... may just be the ticket of the year, who knows, i know even colours of the same bait don't work well in particular areas- ie mustard seed being good on the kawarthas chain and not so good here, just one of them things i guess"
