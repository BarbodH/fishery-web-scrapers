It says it is auctioning of remaining hunting, fishing, archery stocks and store fixtures. So if anybody is interested it may be a chance at some good deals."
51240,Gerritt,2007-03-24 16:33:00,6129,Screw Em.... Glad they are gone.... good riddance Pro Gear and your horrid customer service...  Looks good on em... I wouldnt spend a dime there if I was forced too...  Lets you know EXACTLY why they are going out of business...as they have no concept of customer service whatsoever. I hope the moron of an owner is taking a bath and is left penniless and heartbroken. I may toss a dime into his hat as he is begging on the streets for his next fix... Wait... No I wont...  That is my opinion and I am entitled to it.   Gerritt.
51241,Steve,2007-03-24 16:34:00,2075,I agree Gerritt.  100%.
51256,silveradosheriff,2007-03-24 17:06:00,1025,They did have terrible prices.
51297,Fishmaster,2007-03-24 19:36:00,920,Did they go Brankrupt ....i heard they took the MNR for alote of cash for Lic fees ..is it a action not run by the owners ...but run by Goverment Closesure
51309,caper,2007-03-24 20:08:00,210, I'm going out on a limb here but I'm guessing you had a bad experience there?
51314,express168,2007-03-24 20:28:00,327,"I have not shopped there before as I usually shop at Fishing World or Bills baits , nothing wrong with your opinion Gerrit if it reflects the actual service you recieved. I don't know if it is a government seizure or a bankruptcy, I just saw it listed in todays paper. I just mentioned it as unfortunate as another business closing down in this city."
51393,Corey,2007-03-25 00:32:00,355,"hrm... wonder if they have anything descent left...  Maybe I will drag Gerritt out for a bit, I can look for deals while he can piss in their AC (billy's idea).  cd."
51415,easton13th,2007-03-25 01:46:00,371,The service experienced was never the greatest. Gerritt put it best.....They were over priced while they were open and even at 5o% off they were high priced. I was in there the other day and they had a lot of fixtures and displays left but PRODUCT I was told by the owner he is not interested in selling cheap.....WHAT WAS NOT SOLD HE WAS PUTTING ON E-BAY....
