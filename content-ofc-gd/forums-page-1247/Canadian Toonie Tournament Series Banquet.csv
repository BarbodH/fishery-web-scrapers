I thought I would extend an invitation to any OFNers that might be interested in coming out this season.  It will give you a good feel of what to expect.  The night will include Dinner, Trophies, Awards (all our Junior members from last year will receive trophies, BPS hats and a Dave Mercer DVD), some great videos from last season, as well as lots of Door Prizes. We also plan on kicking off the new season by unveiling the 2007 Tournament Schedule and a sneak preview of the new and improved CTTS website.  Scott Huffman has accepted an invitation to be our guest speaker.  Scott won the 2005 Canadian Fishing Tour 2-Day Pro-Am at Chippawa and walked away with $10,000.  He is the two time defending champion of the Iceman Open held on Lake Erie in the late fall and is the St.Catharines Bassmasters 2006 Angler of the Year.  Scott brings a wealth of knowledge based on his extensive Tournament Fishing experience and the countless hours that he has spent on Lake Erie.  He is one of the most knowledgeable Touring Pros on fishing the Eastern Basin of Lake Erie.  If you're interested in joining us for an entertaining evening, please PM me asap.  It would be great to have a few more OFNers come out.  Location: Judge & Jester (formerly Winchester Arms) 17 Main Street East, Grimsby Date: Tuesday, March 27, 2007 Time: 6:30 pm Map below: Judge & Jester"

50791,huey graphite,2007-03-23 11:44:00,362,"Just my like. I finally get some vacation time, 1st time south in 7 years and it causes me to miss such a great opportunity to meet other anglers in my neighbourhood. To make it worse, a chance to learn a little about fishing the eastern basin of Erie.  Wish I could attend."
