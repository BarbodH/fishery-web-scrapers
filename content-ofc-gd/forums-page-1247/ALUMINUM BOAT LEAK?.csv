I have scanned the hull, loaded her up with water on the trailer, removed underwater fittings and caulked/sealed them tight, caulked any seams I thought were suspect, but still can't seem to stop the inflow...I am about ready to drop her at the dealer and leave it there until he can find the problem. Any suggestions would be appreciated- I will try anything to stop the leak. It is not a safety issue as I can bilge it out durring the day , but I can't leave it docked and unnatended."

Then he put in it the water and found it only leaked under power down the driver side. looked under the egde with a flashlight and found a crack in his spedo line....go figure. worth a check."

I HAVE ONE LAST THING TO TRY BEFORE SHE GOES INTO THE WATER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS HUNTING FOR SALMON ANYWAYS SEND ME A PM AND LETS TALK MAYBE TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THEN ONE
51506,hawg_hauler,2007-03-25 12:30:00,69,Small leaks in aluminum boats are usually caused by stressed rivets. I have the same issue with my 16 ft Alumacraft and have tried many times to reseal rivets. This year I think i will invest in some good quality anti-fouling paint for the hull and see if that will seal it up.
51508,bushman,2007-03-25 12:35:00,23,If you find a leak use stuff call J-B weld it is just like steel when it gets hard i used it on my boat never leaked after that alot of them were rivets .
