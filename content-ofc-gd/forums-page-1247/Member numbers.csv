50376,tjsa,2007-03-22 04:10:00,1578,"Cisco, when we all migrated here, we had a choice, start anew with post count, or have our existing post count(if we could remember it, or if the old board was still relatively available to confirm it) and have one of the mods reset our post count to reflect what it was before the new board. Lots of us, including yours truly, chose to have our existing post count from the old board matched to this new board. NO membership required, just ask a mod to reset your post count to what you think, or know, what it was before the new board software change."

50537,Daplumma,2007-03-22 16:49:00,1961,The member numbers were assigned to the person in the order that they joined the new board.Some of the low number guys were helping test the new board for a couple of days before it went online.Mostly it was the guys that dont fish much that had the time to help test the board.
