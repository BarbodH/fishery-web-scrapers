I headed down to one of my favourite tribs this morning about an hour before light .. and was surprised to see already about 6 people fishing 'my' drift .... by 7:30 I was ready to leave and there were over 50 people within 100 yards of me and a grand total of two fish landed (none by me) ... couldnt take it any more so I moved to another trib ... which was chocolate milk and pretty much a wash out for today ... anyhow I gues thats it for the quiet fishing until after opener's .... its amazing what a little warm weather will do
