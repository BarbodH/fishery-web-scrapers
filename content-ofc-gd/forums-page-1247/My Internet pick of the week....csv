51165,snag,2007-03-24 04:36:00,1932,"Rick,  I hope I can get this.  I'm a huge floyd fan.  I still have bootlegs on vinyl.  One of them is called ""the great gig in the sky"" this was recorded in 71-72 with different lyrics than what made the final cut on that epic album  Syd Barretts my hero.  Thanks"
51200,Greencoachdog,2007-03-24 11:57:00,8163,   Get a haircut ya damn Hippy!!!
51307,jediangler,2007-03-24 19:56:00,1923,"Great pick, Rick. Another good watch is ""Pink Floyd in Pompei"". The Floyd do a live open air concert, in a pompein amphitheater, without any fans. Hey Snog, a good bootleg is ""Crackers, damn braces, bless relaxes"". And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too...you'll know where I'll be."
