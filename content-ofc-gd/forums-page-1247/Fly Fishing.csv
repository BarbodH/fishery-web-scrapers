I used to Fly fish here and there as a kid but havent done in it in years, I recently went and bought some line for my rod as I thought I would try it out for Brookies and Smallies this year. The problem is the line isnt like I remember. I used to have this thick floating line that you stuck a barbed pin up the end of it with a loop on the end of it to tie a 4 or 5 ' leader and then the fly but the line now is so thin... Basically my question is how is the rigging for fly line done these days.. Is there a proper way to tie the leader to the fly line or am I possibly missing an essential part I dont know about.  Thanks for any help guys...  Chris"

51229,MJL,2007-03-24 15:23:00,2427,Did you put it on backwards?  The running line is thin compared to the head of the line.  Are you talking about the backing?  It's a thin braid-like line you have between the fly-line and the spool...It's used to extend the capacity  Maybe you have a level line instead of a weighted forward fly line.  Maybe you have a shooting line designed to be used with matching heads.  When in doubt take it to a local fly tackle shop.  They should know.  As far as leader to line methods of attaching  There's  - Standard nail not - Loop to loop using those braided loop connectors - Needle knot method where you pierce the line with the needle and draw the leader through the end of the fly line for a smooth connection - I use a nail knotted loop to loop method.  Take 5 inches of thick mono and nail knot it to the fly line.  At the other end of the 5 inch piece tie in a small loop.  Then tie in a small loop in your leader and join both loops together. - there's also another simple knot but I can't remember how to do it...You can find it somewhere on the link Muskiestudd provided.  I think you can find it in James Castwell's list of articles.  There are plenty more ways to do it but these ones are fairly common.  Hope this helps
51284,huntervasili,2007-03-24 18:28:00,1604,I nail knot the backing to the fly line and then use a loop to loop for the fly line to leader and from leader to tippet I use the blood knot... If you want to avoid doing the loop to loop you can always nail knot the leader to the fly line and pull really tight... I have done that and it works fine...
