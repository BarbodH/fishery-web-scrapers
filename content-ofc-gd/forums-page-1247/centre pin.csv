51319,Canuck2fan,2007-03-24 20:47:00,1444,"The two spots I checked today had a couple inches of visibility but the current was going about 60MPH LOL. So I bottom fished for 6 hours and tested out my rain gear, since I never saw a fish except for a tragic looking salmon swimming around that apparently forgot to die after spawning last fall."
