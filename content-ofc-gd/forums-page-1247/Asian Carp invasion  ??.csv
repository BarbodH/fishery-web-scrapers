50802,cityfisher,2007-03-23 12:34:00,959,We better not let them in our waters ! !!  
50852,mattyk,2007-03-23 14:41:00,2110,"pretty bad, hope they dont make it into canadian waters. We have them here in kentucky. I saw several last year in the ohio river but not like the numbers in the video."
50854,easton13th,2007-03-23 14:56:00,371,"I hope what they said:  People in Toronto are buying them LIVE, and releasing them into Lake Ontario .....I hope the fines for doing this are on the extreme side. But if the information is on this video it must be being done too regularly, how many time or how many fish have been release in Toronto? Scary........"
50982,huntervasili,2007-03-23 20:45:00,1604,Its amazing how Ignorant people are... aparently it is good luck but any posession of these things should be illegal so as to slow down the process
51058,Rizzo,2007-03-24 00:08:00,4754,"thats some scary stuff, although it would take care of that annoying little jetski problem on our waterways"
51060,Daplumma,2007-03-24 00:12:00,1961,There is a video somewhere of guys bowhunting those things as they fly thru the air.Jump shooting carp with a bow....Sounds like a career opportunity for someone to guide the bowhunters.Maybe even some skeet shooting fun! Joe
51064,dsn,2007-03-24 00:18:00,1018,break out the baseball bat   that should keep them undercontrol
51067,Mike the Pike,2007-03-24 00:24:00,3421,Electricute them all and restock with the good fish.This is very scary we don't need these fish in any other waterways.Time for the hunters to get involved.
51077,PatrickGG,2007-03-24 00:39:00,562,They should release a few hundred thousand Musky into the river then you will see them jumping out of the water for no reason at all.
51112,fishindevil,2007-03-24 01:36:00,6254,"WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY WORRIED,THEY REALLY MEAN WHAT THEY SAY..  .IT WILL END FISHING AS WE KNOW IT.....AND THEY SAY THEY WILL GET HERE JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE IMPORTED crappy SPECIES THAT WE HAVE NOW...  ...OH BOY WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE....."
