I hope i didnt affend everyone to the point of them not helping me sorry , i love fishing but dont get a chance to get out much so when i do get out i try to get as much info as possible and i know this is the site to get it. Most of my childhood  i targeted carp in coboconk now that im older and dont travel up there anymore im looking for new places in the gta such as the islands,humber and grenadier pond. Once a year me and the family usually rent a different cottage in ontario , last year i was up in haliburton for 2 weeks caught my first 2 lake trout and 2 good sized smallmouth. Now its time to try for pike cant learn by only watching saturday morning fishing shows i need to get my line wet its been a long winter. thanks love fishin"
