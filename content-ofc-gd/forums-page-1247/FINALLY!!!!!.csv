That is a great sign that the winter is gone and another great fishing season is on it's way!   Shawn is getting the boat first thing tomorrow morning at 7, LOL and he is heading to his buddies house to ""pimp"" the ride a little more! I cannot wait to get my butt into the brand new Lund, I am excited because I haven't been on it yet, and I cannot wait. I along with everyone else here, have cabin fever and I am stcratching at the door along with Shawn to get outside and fish. Angelina, our daughter is getting excited to get on the new boat too. SUMMER IS FINALLY COMING!!!!!"
