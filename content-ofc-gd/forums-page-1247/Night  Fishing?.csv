I've often caught salmon, on glow-in-the-dark Cleos, or roe bags off botton or under a float . . . .    but I've gone out many times for 'bows, a couple hours before first light . . . .     rarely ever got one befoe the eastern sky starts to lighten. Are the not a night feeder? Anybody else ever have any luck at night?"
50881,ccmtcanada,2007-03-23 15:41:00,7971,"Tried a few times from about 9pm til 11ish...never caught anything, but I've heard that many people have success.  I'll be watchin this thread for sure....lol."
50883,charlied,2007-03-23 15:45:00,584,Not sure about rainbows but have caught browns and lakers in the dark....well the laker was on a glow spoon so that don't count.  I would think you would be able to float for them at night....try using some wrapped shrimp as bait for extra scent!
50951,Sinker,2007-03-23 19:13:00,8692,"I've caught lots of bows in the dark.  Fishing spots you frequent as a matter of fact. The lower stretches of most tribs, in the slow, deep pools. Just a roe bag on bottom......set it in your holder and sit back.  I find nice juicy bait seems to make a difference.  We would go down, light a small fire, and shoot the bull for hours......we'd haul a few fish too.  Sinker"
51095,fishindevil,2007-03-24 01:13:00,6254,yes i have had pretty good success for bows at night usually early in the morn..  .like from about 3am till daybreak....then i leave before the crowds come STOMPING DOWN THE BANKS.....they can get quite lively just before the first hint of daylight....big juicy roe bags or a lively red wiggler will often do the trick....give it a try....cheers   good luck

51172,holdfast,2007-03-24 05:01:00,1813,"Lake Memphremagog Quebec (wrong spelling) I'm a warm water fisherman, love bass at night.  But at my buddies turf, he caught 3 Rainbows, 1 Brown off his dock, and me a bite and a fight and lost. Figure it was a Rainbow.  Bottom line he was my Guide, he was surprised, his Dad figured it was luck(Vet) and my buddy figured it was the bait Grubs.  What I think now. Luck, We were at the right palace at the right time."
