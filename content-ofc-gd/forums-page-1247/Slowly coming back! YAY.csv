50499,fishergirl72,2007-03-22 16:02:00,455,"Well it is good to be back. Fishindevil and I had to leave for a couple of weeks, due to a family emergency. The last couple of weeks have been very hard but finally there is light at the end of the tunnel and things are getting back to normal.   We are planning to get the boat out this weekend if things goes as planned.  I hope that everyone is doing well and we are looking forward to reading and posting great threads. One last thing, I would like to thank K-Dawg, Fishergirl and OFC for the Extreme Fishergirl Contest, I received my prize pack last week and it is awesome!  I cannot wait to use my new rod this spring!"

Take care guys...see you around! Cliff"
