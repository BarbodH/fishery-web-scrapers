You can go to any pond and it is pretty much stacked with these little guys. Any ideas on how they get there, like i mean its pond after pond filled with these guys. Oh and you can knock of stoking, rivers flowing into the ponds, no link between ponds, and there are soo many ponds like i mean that the 1 pond we were fishing, there were about 4 or 5 others. and that is only a small part that we were in. for the drive there, i counted about 1 pond for every 10 secs. oh and i saw that they are feeding on eack other(found a little brookie in the stomach of one). this i find to be weird is this normal in a fishery    this is one of the ponds we were on  another pond(different)  another  this is the little one off the main highway(stacked with brookies) and tiy, very tiny     hope you enjoy, the fishing is great here (not very big brown trout are bigger here) but you can go from pond to pond and be sure to catch fish. I just really want to understand this system here. Not sure how they get there lol"

304447,bigredfisher,2009-02-10 16:14:00,300,"no pan yet, cant wait to try them though"
304592,Sinker,2009-02-10 22:15:00,8692,Those are true wild speckle trout.  The rock is full of them. You won't catch anything else in fresh water that is wild.  Sinker

I can give you some nice areas close to Town that have some bigger ones and probally hook you up with my friends to go for some sea trout. I may be down there in a few weeks for the Trout run. These trout are natural and you would be surprised but that pond pictured in your pics does have a river(Gutter as they call then down there) No stocking just proper fishing and clean,clear,water and air for them to breed and not alot of people fish them."
