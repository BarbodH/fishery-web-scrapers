303930,GBW,2009-02-09 20:57:00,8460,"that is a good deal, thanks for posting."
303961,cram,2009-02-09 21:35:00,1733,btw -- for floatation purposes I wouldn't wear these things without a floater coat or a lifejacket.  Would hate to be in the water with the bottom part of my body trying to rise above the top part.
303970,FishOn,2009-02-09 21:45:00,136,You are right Cram. Have to have the jacket as well. I hope that is on sale as well. Cheers.
