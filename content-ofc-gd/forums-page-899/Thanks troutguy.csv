304187,silvio,2009-02-10 02:13:00,433,"I arranged plans to fish with trout guy and his buddies on Sunday. I must say he's as nice as they come, he sledded me out even brought my old man and me a hut. Fishing was ok but it really doesn't matter when you’re around such great guys. He is extremely good at what he does even when the fishing was tough he found out the pattern. I must say I now want a clam and a sled because of him lol. Well have to hit it up again bro I might be up Monday let me know if you’re down. I am going to call you this week with a few good perch spots for your tournament now that I know you got a sled. Once again thanks bud for everything you did for us. Till next time play safe.  My whitey My day lost one and we were marking all day. Troutguy has a few pics of his own.  "
