303527,pike slayer,2009-02-09 00:01:00,1177,"nice pike pics, those xraps are key to catching pike. also candy for bass, walleye, etc."
303557,diggyj,2009-02-09 00:29:00,548,Great shots. Hoping to hook into some of those TO pike soon.
303665,msp,2009-02-09 02:34:00,1336,Thanks for sharing your pics. I can smell those snot rockets from here. Ya gotta love how aggresive they are. Keep jerkin em up.
303704,rockfish,2009-02-09 04:03:00,91,"Yep, lots of snot rockets in the Niagara area.   You're doing good when u catch a few in the over 30"" range inland and will mostly find the bigger bruisers in Lake O and Erie when u hit them right."
303714,rbaquial,2009-02-09 05:14:00,968,Awesome pics dude!
303782,snag,2009-02-09 14:47:00,1932,"Nice collage Rocky,  Great water shots. It's a little unnerving thinking that they may shake and run before the land shot.  Keep them coming"
303803,smokin joe,2009-02-09 15:33:00,226,Nice pics dave.  We'll have to get out soon for some gator fishing.

303982,rockfish,2009-02-09 22:09:00,91,"Thanks for the replies, suspending cranks with a stop and go retrieve are the way to go for cold water (sluggish) Pike. I know a few members have already seen a bunch of my pike pics a couple times."
