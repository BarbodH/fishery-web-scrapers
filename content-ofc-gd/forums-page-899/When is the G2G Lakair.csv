303571,Mike the Pike,2009-02-09 00:52:00,3421,So when is the great June gathering this year?  MTP
303575,Rich Clemens,2009-02-09 00:56:00,3131,I'm hoping it is the third week-end in June again (20th).  Already got me a cabin from the 18th to the 25th.  Hey - that's only a a little over 4 months
303576,irishfield,2009-02-09 00:57:00,26272,Lakair... or somewhere else were there's fish !
303581,Mike the Pike,2009-02-09 01:04:00,3421,Not enough fish last year Wayne?
303583,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-09 01:05:00,1362, Got enough room on your island for all of us Wayne??
303593,Greencoachdog,2009-02-09 01:13:00,8163,It's the 27th of June this year... or so I hear.  There's fish there... they're just insolent!!!  Hoping the later date this year will make it a little better on the cold fronts coming in!... maybe it'll be warmer too and I won't freeze my tucas off!!!
303604,kickingfrog,2009-02-09 01:20:00,8333,  It's not the temperature Dawg... it's the shine thinnin' yer blood.
303606,Mike the Pike,2009-02-09 01:22:00,3421, Well the 27th would be good for me school ends June 23rd here so could take advantage of dropping off some of my kids to Granma's place just 20 mins from Northbay then finally attend a lakair g2g.  Glen don't give me that cold crap.You survived Quinte in November you old dog.Lakair is a heat wave compared to Quinte.  Now is it too late too book a cottage I know Steve(TroutandMuskiehunter) wants to go.  So when is it this year Roy??  MTP
303723,lew,2009-02-09 09:30:00,12766,"I'll be up there from June 22--29 and lookin forward to another great week as always.  I don't have a schedule here, but I'm asuming musky opens on the 20th ??"
303726,Roy,2009-02-09 10:43:00,13728,"Yes Lew, muskie opens on the 20th. The reason the G2G is the 27th this year is that bass doesn't open till then and we didn't want to leave the bass guys out of this at all. There will be folks there the week previous and the week after I'm sure. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone there again this year."
303783,BITEME,2009-02-09 14:49:00,1968,  Maybe somewhere with higher bridges
303793,irishfield,2009-02-09 15:15:00,26272,"That too Peter... but I shouldn't have a problem this year since it's 2"" shorter ! lol"
303801,TJQ,2009-02-09 15:29:00,7806, ha ha ha!!!
303852,LeXXington,2009-02-09 17:56:00,1928,27th It is then
303893,Handlebarz,2009-02-09 18:54:00,3790,Go figure the first year that the GTG is not the same weekend as our MCI outting and my wife is out of a job I hope we can get some $$$ for the weekend it would be great to make it up for one in my life time.
303919,SlowPoke,2009-02-09 20:29:00,2984," Hey Mike, maybe we could hookup for a quick trip.. something to think about."
303923,John,2009-02-09 20:48:00,2956," Yeah, sorry to hear it........That's what Leah was telling Barbara."
304007,irishfield,2009-02-09 22:37:00,26272,Yah... but did she also tell her that Spiel supplied me with a spare larger tip ?? ??
304029,Handlebarz,2009-02-09 23:15:00,3790,that one might be hard this year Brian as the wife will be out of a job by then and I dont think there will be t omany trips that the family will not join me LOL.  Will have to see what happens closer to then. As for now we are just doing the family weekend in Aug
304031,Roy,2009-02-09 23:21:00,13728,"You're a good family dude, Mike. I'm sure you'll get through it just fine."
304032,Spiel,2009-02-09 23:22:00,9065,  Paleeeeeease don't drag me into this.  Oh and whenever it is I'll be there.
