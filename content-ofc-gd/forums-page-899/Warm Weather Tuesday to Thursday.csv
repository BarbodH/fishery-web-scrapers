Was planning to go ice fish on Simcoe this coming Friday, just wondering would it be safe to venture out on the ice??? Would this warm weather melt a large portion of the 12 to 13 inches of ice on the lake??? Thanks."

304220,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-10 02:45:00,2585,just remember there is no such thing as safe ice.  that being said it will be wet and should freeze up nicely next week.  cheers!
304243,Ramble,2009-02-10 03:11:00,713,"The thermo-dynamics of the situation say no problem.Current areas might loose a little ice, but should be good. I'm kinda looking forward to it knocking te snow down.  -Dave"
