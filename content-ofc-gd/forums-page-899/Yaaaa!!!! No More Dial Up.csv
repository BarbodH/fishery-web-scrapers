304694,Joeytier,2009-02-11 00:27:00,3990,I'd rather not have a computer than have dial-up.
304768,Beans,2009-02-11 01:46:00,3339,I know how you feel...I waited for four years for Ma Bell to put hi-speed in this area and finally gave up...contacted my cable company...and by bundling my tv cable...I ended up saving approx $35 a month...
