303513,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 23:45:00,8163, Yeah... I thought he got buried in a snowdrift by the plow or something!!!  Where ya been Mikey???
303529,Mike the Pike,2009-02-09 00:01:00,3421, I have been good Don alot of renovations.Trying to finish off my Garage inside lots of work but no fishing.  Gotcha MTP
304059,skeeter,2009-02-10 00:06:00,1907,"ITS NOT SEIZED...... i can turn the primary clutch by hand 3 or 4 turns backwards. then it gives a clink and stops turning, like there is something  caught in it. i can then pull the start cord and it will turn foward the same amount and stop. both pistons are moving up and down. the plugs are a greyish brown and dry. the fan belt is still in working order and it also turns when i turn the clutch..... so can any one tell me what it might be???????????? please"
304071,ciceri,2009-02-10 00:29:00,535,"that doesnt mean it did not seize, when they seize they are hot and the piston is expanded, when they cool down the piston becomes smaller and isnt seized anymore, i've had first hand experience with that twice  Since its a fan, the best thing to do is take the head off and look at the pistons and check for damage. Or even look threw the exhaust ports if you can."
304082,2 tone z71,2009-02-10 00:36:00,1311,"pull the heads on it fairly easy ,or take a long handle screwdriver pull the plugs out insert screwdriver and turn over slowly if theres slack or clanking a rod bearing let go,id fix it for ya if it was closer ,could very well be a crank bearing,I wouldent force it around to much if its stopping you can do more damage"
304094,Muskieman,2009-02-10 00:57:00,2472,"It's not a hard job...  Pull the fan shroud off the engine..5/16 socket I think...  then take the exhaust off..3/8  allan wrench.  Take the plugs out... then take the heads off...1/2"" or 9/16  I forget.  Tap the Cylinders lightly with a "" Bob Malette "" rubber mallet and pull them off ...  What do you see?...  My guess is that the right hand side piston has blown.. that's right on the fan side. due to the Nylon gear that runs the Oil Injection.. or the fan belt slipped while wet.  I've blown  the  368cc{ 377 } .. the 447 {439 i think}  and of course the 497 {503}  Usually an easy 350.00 job.  Post pics  Good Luck!!  RFS "

304125,skeeter,2009-02-10 01:15:00,1907,thanks for the replies... i will see if i can do it and i will post the pics...  thanks guys
304129,irishfield,2009-02-10 01:19:00,26272,"Heck... I looked at mine to confirm there was even a belt driving that fan and it didn't look too easy to ""just pull that fan shroud off""."
304134,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-10 01:22:00,835,I had a motor do the same thing but I can't remember what it was.  If you can turn it 4 turns .... whats on that motor that turns at a ratio to the crank  ....has a bolt backed out of the stator or starter......the fan is belt drive  so it would be at a ratio to the crank is something catching in it.  Can't be in the cylinder or it wouldn't get through a full stroke.  Maybe if you gently bump it up where it stops you might be able to here where it is.  Hard to guess without hands on.
304146,skeeter,2009-02-10 01:33:00,1907,"it feels like and sounds like its coming from inside the primary clutch, but thats just my guess. and the dealer had the stator coil out to repair a gap in it a year ago last december, because it wouldnt start with the key buy it would when you pulled it over."
304171,ciceri,2009-02-10 01:55:00,535,"oh, and i rebuilt my 99 mxz 600 over x-mas break for $400. That was to bore it over 20 thousand, pistons, bearings, circlips, rings and full gasket kit.  ride em and fix em"
302948,skeeter,2009-02-07 22:11:00,1907,"97 ski doo 500 sle touring does anybody have an idea on how much it is to rebuild the engine? any members here do that sort of work? does anyone know of a good and reasonable place?

302984,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-07 22:50:00,0,how do you know it is seized?  what happened explain?  we might be able to help  a engine for that are a dime a dozen (good thing)  but they are very good engines
302985,pike slayer,2009-02-07 22:55:00,1177,need more info on the blown motor! you can check out www.dootalk.com or www.hardcoresledder.com both great sled sites and you can find all the info on there plus parts to. good luck!!
303001,skeeter,2009-02-07 23:17:00,1907,i was driving out on simcoe today and it lost power and quite. when you turn the key it only gives a loud clink. the pull cord will not come out. and the front clutch will not turn by hand even with the drive belt off  and it died right in the middle of a slush pond the slush went right over the top of my boots i did drive thru quite a few of them..
303012,pike slayer,2009-02-07 23:43:00,1177,k definitly seized it right up and more then likely the top end. the question is how bad the cylinders are. if they arent in bad conidtion and just need to be honed then you need a piston kit. you can get full kits on ebay for $89 or though the dealer for $300ish. if the cylinders arent bad then it should be 2-3hours shop time. if you got a mangled cylinder then its gonna cost you alot unless you can find a used one. good luck!
303013,skeeter,2009-02-07 23:46:00,1907,thanks for the help pike slayer!!!!
303085,Bernie,2009-02-08 02:06:00,3190,More than likely a piston has seized. But why did it happen? These engines are quite durable. There is usually a cause to the problem. Most of the time it is because of a lean condition from a restricted jet in a carburator or a bad seal in the crankcase. See this happen often where guys come in buy the parts and get thier buddy to fix them up but they don't fix the real issue. Then they blame the machine
303089,irishfield,2009-02-08 02:14:00,26272,.. or is your oil reservour still FULL ? ie engine running on straight gas and oil injection failed. I'm real curious as to the cause since I'm driving the exact same sled in a 98 model.
303099,Bernie,2009-02-08 02:23:00,3190,"Lack of oil is a real possibility Wayne, but conditions today would call for a lot more throttle in slush and heavy snow and that's where lean carbs blow pistons. I had mine out on the lake today too and had it pinned to the bar several times. That's why I suggested that is the ""likely"" cause. It was more for a heads up to fix the cause as well as the symptom for anyone when fixing up any kind of engine."
303128,skeeter,2009-02-08 02:56:00,1907,oil tank is just under the half way mark
303135,skeeter,2009-02-08 03:03:00,1907,"someone suggested that slush might have gotten into the engine, and to take out the plugs and try to pull it over and see if water comes out.... is this a possibility???"
303137,Bernie,2009-02-08 03:10:00,3190,No it wouldn't. The only way is if it was submerged.
303141,skeeter,2009-02-08 03:13:00,1907,thanks bernie. any idea how much to get it rebuilt? and where?
303145,Bernie,2009-02-08 03:20:00,3190,Don't know too many shops down your way Skeeter. Perhaps some other OFC'ers could suggest a local for you. As far as an estimate goes it will depend a lot on what needs to be replaced. And you won't know for sure until it comes apart.
303196,2 tone z71,2009-02-08 04:38:00,1311,"would  it turn over once it cooled off,tell ya powering thru that slush is tough on them ,those Rotary 500s are tough,but nothing lasts forever,300.00 for a set of 20 thou Wisecos ,80 cyl to bore em ,get a crank from Adrien Bernard for 400.00 and a gasket set  for 80.00 ya got yourself a new plant, hopefulloy the rotary faces arent all scared from metal fragments and the brass gear survived the lock up your good to go.I do 3-4 Rotary Rebuilds  a winter 1000.00 plus your own labour your back in buisness"

303226,Fishmaster,2009-02-08 12:30:00,920,"Berns sled blew a plug then just quit like yours out on the ice... We hauled it home and ripped it apart and this is what you will probably find when you get the piston out of yours...  Fan belt was slipping so no cooling or little engine cooling on the clutch side means an overheated engine, specially when going through the slush out there.      Ordering the parts first thing tomorrow and should be back up and running by Wednesday..."
303228,lew,2009-02-08 12:38:00,12766,"You may already be familiar with these folks skeeter, but if not their a snowmobile dealer/repair shop on Kennedy Road. I used to buy all my snowmobile clothing from them years ago, but never had any repairs done there.  They've been around for alot of years though, so they must be doing something right and would possibly be able to help you out if your unable to do the repairs yourself.  http://cdn-9.psndealer.com/e2/dealersite/i..._image_both.jpg   EDIT>>>>>  That link I posted doesn't seem to work but just type Snow City Cycle into Google"

If it was lean could bean air leak in the seal, intake boot.  Did you pull the plugs and see what they looked like?  Coould also be an oil pump going for a sheeeeeeet.  Lots of used stuff around as mentioned before.  Good ole sleds. wrenching is fun  Bryan"
303462,skeeter,2009-02-08 22:34:00,1907,wrenchin is fun if you have a place to do it but i live in an apartment. and i dont have the repair manual for it as they havent made one yet. so im sheet out of luck.
