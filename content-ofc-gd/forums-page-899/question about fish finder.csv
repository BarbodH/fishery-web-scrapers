304043,Roy,2009-02-09 23:43:00,13728,"Sorry, I don't undestand the question. You have an Eagle Fishmark 320 and you put an Eagle 500c on what?"

304096,Sinker,2009-02-10 00:59:00,8692,"I do the same thing, but with an x-97/500c.  Sounds like your transducer is messed up. Switch them and see what happens.  I've had a new one for mine on order for 3 weeks now, still waiting.  Sinker"

304620,moose,2009-02-10 23:05:00,266,"went to lowerance to day they checked out fish finder and told me it was apower issue then they sold me a new transducer seemed to be working better, its funny with it being power i had just tested batteries and they were 11.86volts lots of power . going to hook up in fish tank and see how it goes."
304638,Sinker,2009-02-10 23:36:00,8692,I'm going to lowrance tomorrow. I'm sick of waiting for a new transducer. Its been 3 weeks!! How much  did they charge you?  Sinker
304641,moose,2009-02-10 23:41:00,266,"80 plus tax, it seems to be working in fish tank i had to move the batteries in pack to turn on then it s working iam going to keep trying it every couple of hrs, take your parts with you so they can test them right there"
304664,Sinker,2009-02-11 00:04:00,8692,"Thanks, will do.  I'm not sure I'd trust readings from a fish tank. I know mine doesn't mark right until I'm 3-4 ft deep.  All I get is surface clutter.  What are you using for a battery?  Sinker"
