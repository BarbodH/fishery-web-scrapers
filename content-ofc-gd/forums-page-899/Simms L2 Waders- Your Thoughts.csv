304218,baironhorse,2009-02-10 02:43:00,145,Hi I am thinking about purchasing the Simms L2 Waders. Let me know what you think. I currently have neopreen ones that are great in fall/ winter- heavy sweat in them in spring or mild conditions ....Are the L2 really breathable and comfortable? Also how strong are they? Your thoughts. With Thanks

I was actually in the same boat as you maybe 2 months ago. before i switched to simms, i've been wearing neoprene for the summer/fall...and i must say..GET BREATHABLES!!you stay as warm as neoprene in the winter, and when you walk the creeks, the sweat will get out faster than neoprene..  just make sure you get 1-2 size bigger. the best way is to put on the waders, and bend over all the way and see if you feel comfortable (no homo)."

Ya I sweat my bag off in the neopreen's...I had a laugh reading your last line...I know what you mean you need the room if you wanna move nice and easy and not split your crocth open when you layer up! Thanks for your input...Oh when does the BP sale end??
