303594,Maverick,2009-02-09 01:13:00,371,"I've had the same problem and so have a lot of people I know. A buddy's dad had Express Vu up in Yellowknife, NT. He took a look at the bill after 4 or 5 months of service and noticed he was getting charged BC sales tax, up in NT they only have the GST. So he gave them a call and you guessed it, got an over seas call center. After trying to explain to them that he did not live in BC they still did not understand him. Then he had to speak with the manager and managed to explain to them that he did live in NT. Gets his next bill and they charged him $70 relocation fee for moving from Yellowknife, BC to Yellowknife, NT. So he called them again and spent almost an hour explaining to them that he hadn't moved in 35 years, speaking with several managers, he was able to get them to credit him with the $70 but nothing for his time or the extra tax he had paid because he ""lived"" in BC lol.  Bell Canada was made by the people of Canada, it is an insult for them to outsource employment like this, regardless of which country they outsource to."

A friend of mine that works for Bell told me this little trick!"

I mean, its always fun, and you dont get annoyed at them because your laughing so hard.     Tell tale sign that you dont have anything smart to say when you start correcting peoples grammer."
303699,BillM,2009-02-09 03:44:00,17367,"Bell Canada has a huge support center right on Eglinton Ave W just east of Eastgate...   Even Ray Charles couldn't miss it.  Ma Bell had crappy customer service way before it was ever outsourced  I manage a team of 30 guys that are based out of Bangalore.  I wouldn't trade them for anything.  Hard working, honest and they know their stuff.."
304305,rbaquial,2009-02-10 06:31:00,968,"Yup, its because of ""Out-Sourcing"" that people like them get a job... and people like myself, are OUT of a JOB! ::"
304343,Spiel,2009-02-10 12:05:00,9065,"Funny, Bell Canada called me yesterday to ensure that I was a happy customer. After a few words from the rep to confirm that I had home phone service, internet and cell with Bell I began to unload on him about the poor service with all three and the ever increasing price for this service. I told him I was currently and actively seeking to sever all my ties with Bell and then he hung up.....LOL"
304366,hawkeye,2009-02-10 13:18:00,162,"Bell in all its iterations is a dinosaur. The best thing that could have happened is a merger with Telus, and eliminate the dead wood in both companies. Most of the Bellites I deal with have been there over 20 years and they ceased caring/learning 19 ago. The company I work for is in the top 10 in size of Bell’s customers  and still their service rots.  One of my guys had occasion to call tech support one night. Got someone he couldn’t even understand. In frustration he asked the tech’s name (probably unpronounceable) the Tech replied Abraham Lincoln.  We still laugh about it, but Bell service is no laughing matter"

I have canceled everything from them except the internet and phone, why pay $50 a month for a sat when you can get  it for free!  Nice to know that Bell CANADA doesn't even support it's own Country! They are supporting the Terrorist!  You can call a million times and they will tell you same thing off there script, please unplug and reboot modem.  I have heard calling the French hotline and then speaking English to them will work and you will get someone from Quebec, I guess the Arabs haven't learned French yet!  Whats next Canada Post is gonna outsource to Japan?"
303396,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-08 20:34:00,0,  actually canada post is outsourced  about 5 years ago to a company called innovapost  ** I bet nobody knows about this one***  I was working on their IT contract at the time and everything got changed over to new letterhead etc. except for the post offices and mailboxes
303400,Terry,2009-02-08 20:41:00,14456,wait till you call revenue Canada and they don't speak English  she kept asking me something and I had no idea what she was saying they would not talk to me because I couldn't tell her what my Poe toe toe was  well after I got someone who spoke some english and he asked me what my postal code was and I had the right answer they would talk to me dang it makes me mad

Many IT and call center jobs are performed in Mumbai and Bangalore.  No terrorists from these modern cities have done a nasty.  It sounds like you don't even distinguish between Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus, let alone between Muslims and Islamisists.  Anyone from over there is a terrorist.  Shame on you.  Bad Zebco.  Anyone not like me is a terrorist.  If you read the paper, you would know that all terrorists come from Saudi Arabia, and all Saudis are terrorists.  Thank goodness we don't outsource to Saudi.  Or to Holland, the Dutch are the worst."

303472,Mike the Pike,2009-02-08 22:47:00,3421,I have had  the same problem too many times .These days I push #2 for the french option its a pleasure for me having french as a second language.  Its nice too have a conversation with someone in my own province .The person on the other end of the line told me many english quebecers opt for the french option to avoid the confusing conversation overseas.  Enough is enough return the jobs to Canada
303493,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-08 23:26:00,1183,"I have had to make calls in the past to sympatico....but hey I'm so green with computers that I knew I was likely a good source of frustration for them as well....so...with a few jokes and some chuckles we managed to get through it....chatted a bit about their life in India and mine in Canada....and when the one young lad inquired if I had other computers in the house (which I do for my son / wireless) he asked to speak with my son and made sure that all was good with his computer as well....nice people.  It just takes a bit of patience on both ends....I was warned beforehand about how frustrating it was to call and so when the day came that I had to, I was on guard....but it was very different for me....I had excellent experiences and like I said, lots of laughs.  Can you imagine the abuse they have to take on a daily basis and still be professional and polite....I wasn't comfortable with being called  'maam' and asked them to please call me Nancy and I in turn asked for their name.   That alone set a different tone.  Give it another try but know beforehand that you will be online for a bit and just be patient and kind.  Yes they have an accent...but they do speak English."

303502,SlowPoke,2009-02-08 23:36:00,2984,I'm just happy when they answer quickly; I don't care where they are from or what their native language might be. I've found that most are completely professional and patient with our inane questions or asking them to repeat themselves. I would imagine staffing a 24 hour call center in Canada would be an enormous task and companies might be opting for overseas options for more reasons than just cost saving.
303518,irishfield,2009-02-08 23:49:00,26272,  Oh.. probably ! lol
303526,jace,2009-02-08 23:59:00,472,"I only get offshore tech support when i call during off hours.   ...so i try to call during normal daytime hours and it generally works.  I'll get somebody who's obviously strong in english or french if i call before the early evening.   For a while, most call centers were outsourced to companies in Que, i don't know if it's still true.   There were times back a few years ago when I had to call after getting home at 12am or 4am, and i always got an east indian person.  I don't waste my time doing that anymore.  As a few of you said, I don't think they know anything beyond the scripted checklist they're given on the screen.   Another thing i've noticed now is they don't bother running through the script with me at all anymore.  I blew up at them a few times going through their ridiculous routines so i think there must be some extra CSR comments on my account.  hehe  give it a try.  ."
