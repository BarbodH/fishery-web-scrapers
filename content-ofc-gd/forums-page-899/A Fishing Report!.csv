303901,anders,2009-02-09 19:27:00,1168,"LOL...Sunday the plan was to go back after some specks.  We have tried to get to this lake before but due to some issues, only made it half way.  This time, we made it the whole way!  We were excited.  So after drilling about a dozen holes we start to set up.  Putting down my still line and it gets half way down ...and Fish on....not a big one, but its a speck...unfortunatly it inhaled the hook and had to be kept.  The mood was instantly like kids in a candy store.The fish seemed to be slow after that to start but, soon would come in waves....15 minutes of action everywhere, followed by about 30 minutes, of lull time.  We ened up missing lots, but iced 11 and look home 7 between the 4 of us.  What an enjoyable time.  We were fishing in 15-20 ft of water and most of the action came from jiggin on bottome, with russions spoons, blue fox jigs, and buckshot spoons.  Here are some pics of the fish when we got home.      And this is dinner tonight    Cant wait till Monday when my dad comes home, then its rainbows through the ice on superior, specks in the park and big inland lakers.  Its gonna be a hoot!  Anders"
