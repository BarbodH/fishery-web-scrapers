I am wondering what motor sizes can just bolt in. I also would like to put in a fan cooled motor as opposed to a liquid cooled. Is there a fan cooled that can just bolt in?  Thanks guys  Curt

304234,nancur373,2009-02-10 03:00:00,1211,Been lookin around on dootalk.com and it looks like it would be way easier to go liquid cooled.
