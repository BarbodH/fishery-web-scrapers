303607,jwl,2009-02-09 01:23:00,1056,"Had been having ants in my pants to get out for some Lower River steelie action,I tried to get a tow to head out in my boat yesterday and was wicked bummed I had no takers.  With only having the minivan to tow the boat, it's hit or miss at the launch so I was tyring to find someone with a 4x4 who wanted to get out with me for some big steel.  I finally got out today on an invite I had from a few days ago to join another steelie nut job fishin buddy in his boat out on the river today so a gladly jumped on the chance.  Was a little less then perfect wind for the river and a good bit of shore and boat traffic being the weekend with a about half the boats being US boats fishing our side in the mix, but we gave it a good go and came up with a couple nice ones.  I broke the skunk by boating this one as our first fish of the day     A while later I got this pig pushing over 10lbs easily of totally fresh chrome    And that would add an upgrade from my previous GL trout entry for team #1 with   yepper 28 inches bumping us up 3 inches with 2 bonus inches pending..putting our team to be the first one to break the 100 incher mark for 2009!!!  Hey GCD, I will message you a pic with team sign in it for an entry!!!!!!!  Now I can't wait to get out there and try and top that one!!!!  It was a bit slow out there but I still went 2 for 3 for the day..we went 4 for 6 total in the boat.  Hoping to get out again soon..my boat is all charged up,gassed up and ready to do some"
303616,Bly,2009-02-09 01:33:00,1556,Beauties!!  Nice upgrade for the team also
303620,rockfish,2009-02-09 01:36:00,91,"Nice steelies there Jack, so what was the hot streamer pattern for the day ?  Also how's the river cleaning up with not much floating ice around in your end of town ?"
303633,jwl,2009-02-09 01:51:00,1056," rainbow roe from one I got last time on the Lower on a streamer  ice is hit and miss by the day still...good on both ends of the river today though...down where we fished today and up by my place...and steelies at both ends if you know where to get em!!!!!  I just can't get out enough right now, have to rely on someone else to tow my boat for me or hop on with someone else for a trip.   Need a 4x4 most days this winter to get the boat back in at the launch and up the road out, can't rely that the van will do it every time yet until it gets warmer out, so I been ho'in myslef out for a ride lately  , you got the tow...boat's ready to go"

303652,msp,2009-02-09 02:13:00,1336,Thanks for the report. Nice lookin silver. Keep the porn coming. How did the other boats do out there?
303677,jwl,2009-02-09 02:56:00,1056," I know a couple others who where out there today and got a few, once there are too many boats in the drifts, and rejects running thier boats right through the drift instead of going out and way around the drift to start over again, it spreads the pods of fish up and you have to really pick a couple areas apart and try a couple spots, pick up a fish or 2, then move on and come back to those areas when it's gets quieter."
303694,bigugli,2009-02-09 03:37:00,6138,I'm getting just a tad envious at the moment Jack

304165,jwl,2009-02-10 01:49:00,1056," just fortunate enough to have the better part of 30 years experience fishing that water, and also to fish with a bunch of great guys who also know the river very well. We hop on eachother's boats for the day, or get groups of boats together out there for a day's mission,hit the banks, hike the gorge and put in alot of time each cold weather season.  We all learn stuff all the time out there, compare notes and share tactics all the time.  There is a pretty hardcore group of anglers I fish with over the years, all of us get out there in all sorts of conditions during the cold water season.  Believe me if some guys make it look easy...they put in alot of time, leg work,lost or broken tackle, bumps bruises,scratched boats,dinged props ect...along the way.  Some days are easy, others you really have to put your knowledge to use to get into a fish, it's a big river with lots of variables out there"
