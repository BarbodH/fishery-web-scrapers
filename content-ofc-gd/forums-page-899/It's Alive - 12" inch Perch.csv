303621,Leecher,2009-02-09 01:36:00,7832, So what your saying is that you can't wait to go back for some eyes at St-Marie and get some more  Will have to do it again soon... that plan was a good one
303624,snag,2009-02-09 01:38:00,1932,"Golly,  I'm at a loss.  Call Stephen King for a new Pet Semetary Series  Or wake up Walt Disney to say:  You were right!   Screw cremation,  PERCH ZOMBIES RULE  (How much brain does it consume?)   Freeze me!!"
303625,Leecher,2009-02-09 01:39:00,7832, What were you feeding him to keep it in your tank?
303634,purekgw,2009-02-09 01:52:00,585,just throw minnows in now and then i got a pike in my tank (got it from fish store)
303642,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-09 01:59:00,2582," Didn't feed him anything, but he might have been eating the flakes I was putting in for the goldfish."
303675,Leecher,2009-02-09 02:54:00,7832, Thanks for the info.... was thinking that minnows would of been an ingredient that it could not refuse... but yet again flakes probably provided some type of nutrient for it's survival in a contained environment.
303700,Sinker,2009-02-09 03:44:00,8692,I have a bass that eats shrimp pellets. It'll eat anything though.......  Sinker
303830,Jet,2009-02-09 17:00:00,364,"This happened to me two weekends ago too with some Perch. I feel bad about the fish suffering out of the water, so wanted to ask what methods you guys use to humanely kill fish instantly.  The two I've used are the hard whack between the eyes or a knife straight into the brain.  Anyone know what method is the most humane?"
303909,JohnF,2009-02-09 19:52:00,3494,There are fish that can actually breathe air. Siamese Fighting fish (Betas) gulp air at the surface. It's something to do with environmental adaptation. In nature they live in water that can be so silty it won't hold oxygen. That's why folks can keep 'em in non-aerated water.  JF
303917,Toronto_Angler,2009-02-09 20:24:00,698,Wow that's amazing....Anyone biology whizzes here explain how it's possible?
303943,Cookslav,2009-02-09 21:05:00,1457,"Happend to me this weekend...sort of? We iced some perch caught aroun 9am...gave them the bat and on the ice they went. Then I go to clean them at 6:30pm and they were still kicking, I was shocked to say the least. Gave them the old bat again, and it was lights out...but the nerves were STILL going as I was cutting Kinda gave me the willies LOL Seriously though 9.5 hours out of water...they should have been toast. I have never seen that with any other fish. Could it be a perch specific thing?"
303965,osmondrs,2009-02-09 21:39:00,61,"Hey Leechman:  Interesting experience... I had a similar experience on Jan 30.  Caught a few perch at Simcoe and brought them home to Toronto.  They were iced between 2 - 3:30 pm and we got home about 8:30 pm.  Just like you, I dumped them in the sink and went for a shower.  I come back in the kitchen to find out that the wife had seen two of them moving & put them back in the bucket & filled it up with water.  In 3-4 minutes both were alive & even looked well.  Didin't have the heart to kill them, so we decided to let them be for the night & cleaned up the rest.  We woke up to find both of them belly-up in the morning.  I couldn't figure out why they had survived a good 6 hours out of water & died in the bucket.  Chlorine, maybe??  I wonder.  Os"
303966,FishOn,2009-02-09 21:40:00,136,Maybe it was drunk  and then it recovered???
303972,osmondrs,2009-02-09 21:47:00,61,"  I guess when we've gored the poor fish with a sharp hook through its mouth & dragged it kicking & fighting for its life out of the water, any method would do.  If I was out to be humane, I'd net the fish (as opposed to hooking), pull it gently to the surface, take a picture & gently let it back in the water...  Os"
303981,Leecher,2009-02-09 22:06:00,7832," That's what I thought too.... toast, but this one just came back to life for some unknown reason.  Like I said before, this happened 2 times before and one of them was a walleye   either... most likely chlorine and other chemicals found in our city tap water"
304036,irishfield,2009-02-09 23:34:00,26272,I guess nobody read the link Spiel supplied..... states of fish being frozen right into the lake ice.. and surviving until it thaws again.
304041,moose,2009-02-09 23:39:00,266,cool good thing it wasnt a pike or muskey
304042,purekgw,2009-02-09 23:40:00,585,i was reading it its cool how they live
304046,Leecher,2009-02-09 23:48:00,7832, Yes Wayne I read that.... amazing isn't it!!  I think when I put it in the tub and aim the water flow from the faucet directly into the gill area caused a reaction that brought it back to life.... just like jump starting it LOL
304072,Joey,2009-02-10 00:30:00,9122,"Ah, it was all a ploy, it was just playing dead.  Joey"
304177,Leecher,2009-02-10 02:04:00,7832, Yeah Joey... I know.... tricky little bugger LOL
304339,pikehunter,2009-02-10 11:58:00,1659," If the water wasn't aerated then they could have died from a lack of oxygen. A bucket doesn't hold that much water and whatever amount of oxygen was in the tap water would be quickly consumed. An aquarium air pump with an airstone or an airpump for a minnow bucket may have helped them survive.  The chlorine in the tap water also may have been the final blow but likely lack of oxygen did them in  Don't forget that when they were frozen or partly froze their metabolism was slowed right down to a deep sleep hibernation and this is why they recovered when warmed from the tap water, hypothermia? I'm just guessing"
304583,fishing,2009-02-10 21:54:00,167,"Rising temperature was one of the reasons. Temperature shock killed those two fish. If you leave fish in the fridge or outside, they may not die. It works about 70% of time."
303463,Leecher,2009-02-08 22:35:00,7832,"When I got back yesterday afternoon from our outing I immediately dumped the fish into the kitchen sinc and added cold water to thaw them out before filleting them..... to my surprise my PB perch was moving and coming back to life  I caught it around 9:45am yesterday and was stuffed into a plastic bag until I arrived around 4:15pm, so 7.5 hours later..... just can't believe it     This has happened 3 times to me so far.   Here is a little video of it  12"" PB Perch  Enjoy!! Leechman"
303467,purekgw,2009-02-08 22:38:00,585,lol MAGIC!
303469,diggyj,2009-02-08 22:40:00,548,"Holy cow, that's amazing. Didn't think that was possible. Maybe it wasn't meant to be filleted?"
303471,Burtess,2009-02-08 22:44:00,901,"He is not just alive, but swimming and perfectly vertical with good control, amazing....  Burt"
303475,irishfield,2009-02-08 22:52:00,26272,And many don't believe in Cyrogenics... I think you're onto something Leechman!
303477,rockfish,2009-02-08 22:53:00,91,"That's pretty cool LM, didn't see the video, my pute is a little slow   but have heard of perch coming to life after being frozen for hrs before. As bigug says the fish just go to sleep on the ice and our bud Bill was telling me how his perch ""came alive"" again one time and it probably happens alot.  "
303478,kemper,2009-02-08 22:54:00,2232,seriously?  thats so amazing I feel like someone is messin with me!
303479,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 22:58:00,8163,Blue Catfish and Crappie will do that sometimes too when caught in cold water and put on ice.
303481,GBW,2009-02-08 23:01:00,8460,"Now if you had a fish tank could you put it in to keep feeding to get bigger?  After all, it was frozen for a long time so you didn't transport a live fish...  *edit* By the way, the 2 I kept last week were still trying to breath on the ice after 3+ hours and I was like what the?!?!?!"
303490,Mike the Pike,2009-02-08 23:18:00,3421,Yes Jacques I have seen that a few times throw the perch on the ice frozen solid bring them home put em in the sink and some come back to life.  So how long have you been feeding that one Poutine cheese
303497,Leecher,2009-02-08 23:31:00,7832," GBW funny you mention the tank, I have a 25 gal and that thought cross my mind but just wasn't sure if it was legal to keep a fish that was caught in our waters and also my poor tropical fish that I have would of ended being her dinner  My daugther took the video and she just could not believe that it was still swimming around in the tub when I got home   Mike not poutine but I think it was sardines LOL"
303505,Dano,2009-02-08 23:39:00,719,"Man, would you guys/gals please start killing them when they come out of the water if you are going to keep them, cant be any fun dying slowly....."
303510,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-08 23:44:00,2038,  What method would you use ....  :dunno:
303517,Spiel,2009-02-08 23:48:00,9065, Funny you should mention Cryogenics Wayne.  Read this bit in the paper this morning.
303530,Leecher,2009-02-09 00:02:00,7832," Sorry Dano if it offended you, this was not what I wanted to share.... How can I put it so you understand... the perch was caught and put aside on ice for a while until we decided to leave.  Temp was at -12C and with the wind shield -16C.  When time came to leave, it was put into a plastic bag with 4 more fish, by that time it was frozen solid.  We drove to another lake, fished and return home only to find it coming back to life after I had put it into the kitchen sinc and under very cold running water.  To me this fish was dead and just can't believe that it came back to life.  Again sorry if that offended you Leechman"
303535,GBW,2009-02-09 00:06:00,8460,"with what, a fish bat?  "
303552,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-09 00:23:00,2585,yeah dude i wonder if the mnr guys are watching if they can charge you with illegally transporting fish lol that would suck  that is pretty crazy how they can live that long like that.  Im sure he tasted great though lol  Cheers!
303574,pikehunter,2009-02-09 00:55:00,1659,Amazing!  Did you have the heart to eat this one after all that? I think I would have 2nd thoughts about it. Although I know you aren't legally allowed to transport or release live fish I'd be tempted to take it back to it's home. That is one determined fish.
303585,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-09 01:07:00,709,i still dont believe this one...............i think its the nerves......... or something.
303598,Leecher,2009-02-09 01:14:00,7832, Truly amazing.... I haven't eaten it yet but it did go under the knife.... poor old bugger just wanted to swim anywhere it could.
303600,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-09 01:16:00,709,i had those walleye we caught yesterday night . WHAO MAN!  GOLD IN MY MOUTH!
303609,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-09 01:25:00,2582,"I have seen that many times myself. Once I got some crappies night fishing on Rice Lake. My fish basket came out of the water around midnite. Too tired to clean them when I got home, I put them in a plastic bag in my fridge. The next morning when I got them out to clean them, one of the bigger ones was still flopping around pretty good. Just to see what would happen I threw him in my 30 gallon fish tank with my goldfish. 100% recovery. Kept him in there for about a month and was toying with releasing him,then I decided to finally fillet him up."
303611,nancur373,2009-02-09 01:28:00,1211,i had it happen with crappie. came back to full life'.
303613,jwl,2009-02-09 01:29:00,1056,"that's pretty cool, have had that happen with cat fish before"
303618,bigugli,2009-02-09 01:34:00,6138,"I will fill the live well with perch in the fall, drain the water and pour in 2 -3 bags of ice for the trip home. They will still be alive and kicking 4 hours later. Keep em' cold and they stay alive."
