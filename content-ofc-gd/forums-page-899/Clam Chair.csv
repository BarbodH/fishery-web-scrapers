304093,Joeytier,2009-02-10 00:54:00,3990,"I'm seriously considering getting this, since the only seat I have for ice fishing at the moment is a padded bucket, and my back gets really sore after sitting on something without a back.  I like the rod holders, and even has a fish bag for your catch!  Seems really nice. http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...016000_100-16-0"
304095,e-z-out,2009-02-10 00:59:00,1052,i had one not bad if you plan on fishing out side with it in a hut it's not that great. I'm 6ft and 240LBS and after 8 hours on the chair my back realy starts to cramp up.  I picked up a basspro lawn chair that works great and i can sit there for hours with out the back pain.  Never the less the Clam chair is great for all your rods and reels and tackle. Keeps everything together very nicely.

304120,e-z-out,2009-02-10 01:13:00,1052,Yes and no i was at BPS but it was from one of the board members that i met up there. Like i said not bad chair if your out side just get up now and again and strech
304127,Joeytier,2009-02-10 01:16:00,3990,"Alright, thanks.  I think I'm going to grab one.  Anyone willing to sell?"
