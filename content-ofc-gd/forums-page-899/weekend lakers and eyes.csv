Saturday morning was pretty mild with a cool NE wind but that didn't stop myself the wife and our two kids from heading to a small lake to try for some splake Got to the lake about 9:30 and got some holes drilled Set my daughter up with a jig and minnow and told her to drop it to bottom and this is what she got....    her first perch this year Unfortunately my battery conked out on the  camera right after that Two hours later and only one more perch we decided to head back.  I had planned on going walleye fishing Sat evening but with us giving up on the splake so early I decided to try for some lakers for an hour or so before the walleye bite started. Went to a lake that is only a quarter mile from the inlaws and got set up pretty quickly. Lost a couple right away and then managed this one.. Sorry for the bad pic had to take it after my battery had charged up    One for team five a 17.5"" laker  So after that things slowed right down and it was coming on to 4 oclock I decided to try my luck at some eyes. Managed to catch ten before dark but only 3 worth keeping    Sunday dawned bright and clear and very warm so my son and I along with my father in law decided to try lakers again Here is a small view of the lake  got set up and after five minutes had a bite but lost him Really slow on Sunday so my son decided to get a workout shovelling snow for a fort    About an hour and a half later one of our set lines went down and my son ran over to it which was a good thing as just as he got there the rod started to go down the hole Good grab son  this guy gave him a good fight on my walleye rod with 6 lb test    a couple more of the same laker...about a 22""     And that was about it for the action Going to head back there this weekend as my brother in law and family are coming from Calgary for a week so should get a lot of fishing in sunday and monday"
