303664,irishfield,2009-02-09 02:28:00,26272,Looks like a popular muskie... did ya stick a hose down it's yap Bill ! lol
303671,kickingfrog,2009-02-09 02:43:00,8333,"  Sorry if I scared anybody, I ment the fish."
303697,bassassin,2009-02-09 03:40:00,152,"come on people its just a fish theres nothing wrong with a little razzing some times, 14"" 15"" when they're that big what difference does one inch make. To make a mense i would like to share the rig thats been hammering them for me this year.  Perch drop shot:  tie a loong shank hook 12"" above where you would normally tie on the sinker, but instead of tieing a sinker i tie on a bucktail jig tiped with a peice of miinow or whole minnow.  as a result you end up with a lure on bottom and a long shank hook with a minnow just off bottom...  there you go, we cool now???"

303849,bukee,2009-02-09 17:49:00,58,"Great looking perch and very tasty.  I kept a few pigs like that last year in early spring and found them full of eggs too and the fillets you get out of them end up being disappointing for the size of the fish.  Anyway you look at it thats a great perch, congrats."
304123,Joeytier,2009-02-10 01:15:00,3990,That's just the way it goes.  Every keeper size perch I've ever cleaned was stuffed full of eggs.
303306,glen,2009-02-08 16:29:00,2641,I went out on simcoe on saturday fishing for whitefish.  There was three of us fishing and we all got one whitefish each so it was a good day.   But this story is about a different fish that came into the hole. A little while after i landed my whitefish i saw a big mark on my fishfinder.  I looked over at my extra rod and it was bent right down to the hole.  I run over and set the hook on what i think is a nice whitefish.  It is fighting odd but i still think it is a whitefish.  The gaff is ready as the fish nears the hole.  I look down and wow its a peacock bass.  I put the gaff away because i am not sure if they are in season.  Then i get the fish out of the hole and this is what i see.
303307,Terry,2009-02-08 16:31:00,14456,nice perch for sure
303309,Leecher,2009-02-08 16:32:00,7832,Congratulations glen.... a real hog
303314,Burtess,2009-02-08 16:52:00,901, Thats funny... it does have the colours of a peacock though...
303328,kickingfrog,2009-02-08 17:27:00,8333,Nice! That perch looks like how I feel after Christmas diner.
303335,Greencoachdog,2009-02-08 17:43:00,8163,That's one heckuva Hog Perch!!!  What did it bite?... a minnow?
303338,bassassin,2009-02-08 17:43:00,152,I see you like to round up!
303339,glen,2009-02-08 17:45:00,2641,Minnow on a hook just off bottom.
303352,glen,2009-02-08 18:25:00,2641,"I didnt ""round up"".  The fish was 15"".  I know in the pic it may look like it is not when going by my tape.  I cant explain why.  Maybe i didn't even catch a fish.  Come to think of it i am not in the picture so it must not be mine.  I aint even sure i went fishing now.  Hold on a minute while i get a lawyer."

303365,Billy Bob,2009-02-08 18:59:00,5865,Nice perch. At this time of the year they weigh more because they are full of spawn. I once caught a perch that weighed 2.2 lbs on a electronic scale in the spring just before the spawn took place. That was definitely my biggest perch.
303372,ohhenrygsr,2009-02-08 19:30:00,947,"nice Perch Glen, you finally decided to eat that thing from your fish tank ehh, after all these years of fatting it up"
