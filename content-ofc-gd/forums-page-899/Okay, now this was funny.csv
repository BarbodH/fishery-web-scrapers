Some of that stuff sends you for a loop....it reminds me of a quote  ""Total loss of all basic motor skills. Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue. The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it. "" -Raoul Duke"

304511,ccmtcanada,2009-02-10 19:24:00,7971,"LOL... ""Is this real life?""  Classic!!!!  Like other's here, when I had my 4 wisdom teeth out I did a few strange things.  My brother came with me to get me home afterwards.  When I came to after the surgery, I said I could walk by myself.  The nurse and my brother walked ahead while she gave him instructions on home care.  The got down the hall and looked around...couldn't see me.  They went back to find me curled up on the floor sleeping.  In the pharmacy a little while later, I was having full conversations with people.  Was getting a lot of strange looks.  My brother came to find me...reminded me that I had a mouth FULL of gauze and that no one could understand a word I was saying....LOL.  Then I went home, fell asleep for 4 hours on the couch.  Note to anyone out there...make sure you take your pain medication BEFORE you fall asleep like that cause when you wake up, not only are you alert, but you're running around spewing every swear word you can think of while you look for the pain pills!!!"
