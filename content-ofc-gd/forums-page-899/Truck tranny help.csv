I was sitting at the lights and i went to go and i just started to move and i heard a bang under the truck and now i have no farward gears. I do still have reverse. The tranny fluid is now brown and stinks.  The truck is a 1995 gmc 2wd 4.3L 6 cyl vortec auto.  So is the tranny 100% screwed or is there maybe some slim chance that its a cheap fix? My buddy has a 97 gmc 4wd v8, is there any chance the trannys might be interchangeable? Whats the cost of getting this tranny rebuilt? I know to buy a rebuild is about $1500 but thats a little pricey for a 95 truck thats worth maybe $2500. Any ideas what a used one might cost ?  Thanks for the help in advance, wonder whats next ? maybe the house will fall apart !"

304276,richyb,2009-02-10 03:50:00,774,"Thanks for the info. In my repair manual it says that the truck either has a 4l60, 4l60-E, or a 4l80-E, so would it be the 4l60-E? how can i tell which one it is ?"
304329,BUSTER,2009-02-10 11:34:00,1336,"MY 4L60E WAS $2800 TO REBUILD    sorry to here this, those trans are common for this..get the better servos and covette shift kit installed if you take this route, and i've said it before, transmission repair is a trade on its own bring it to a tranny shop not your regular mechanic.."
304400,richyb,2009-02-10 14:16:00,774,"OUCH now theres a kick in the    im guessing used is the way to go then, since theres 210000k on the truck"
304420,ehg,2009-02-10 14:59:00,2666,"Recently had the tranny go in my 2002 Dodge Caravan. Luckily a buddy is a mechanic and for 850 dollar and a little labour cost, he was able to put a refurbished tranny in which so far seems worth it. I have put only 110 thousand km on vehicle so this first repair should help for awhile."
304475,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-10 17:31:00,835,"Take a good look at it and ask yourself what have you got, is motor good, body, brakes etc if the cost of upkeep starts to = payments it might be time to consider something else.  Cost to rebuild the C6 in my old ford was 600, its the cheapest tranny to rebuild."
