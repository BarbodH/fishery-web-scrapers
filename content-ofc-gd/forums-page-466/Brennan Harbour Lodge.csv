Love the idea that brennan would be new to us and the fact that it looks very different from lady E  We are 4 guys who really want to fish and have a chance at numbers of quality bass, walleye and pike  I know what we can get at Lady E but we are interested in a change of pace.  I have read almost all of the post on the board about Brennan Harbour and almost all are positive but few get into actual fishing success.  We would be okay with getting a guide for the first few days to learn the water but what I really want to know is: Is the resort more of a nice family place where the fishing is okay or is it a great lodge where you can really whack em even on your first time (also like the fact that you have a chance at a musky)  If anyone can share their experience of the fishing it would be greatly appreciated  And so I'm not seen as just a taker  if anyone wants some info on Lady E - fire away  Thanks Gordy"

Classed as trophy musky water, the keeper limit is 54 inches. You're right by the mouth of the Spanish River so steelhead and salmon are possible in September. Watch the weather, if you get a good west wind, you'll get some monster waves rolling right by Brennan Harbour and up the river. If that happens, stay in the bay and catch some pike."
633255,gordy28,2011-10-22 21:12:00,638, Thanks for the info - very helpful
633463,gordy28,2011-10-23 22:48:00,638, Bump  Anyone else have opinions on the quality of fishing ?
642081,gordy28,2011-11-22 16:27:00,638," Update: We have booked Brennan  Harbour Lodge for Sept 1 - 8th This option just worked the best for our group, and overall have heard nothing but positive reviews about the body of water and the lodge owners Plus the price is right - we are going American Plan, upgrading boats (17 foot Lund outfitters with full floor, casting platform and 30 HP yahama electric start) and will have 1 day guided per boat for $1100 per guy including taxes  Thanks for everyones input - will probably be trolling for tips closer to the trip! Asked for a new digital camera for Christmas so ideally I'll post a good trip report as well Cheers Gordy"
642100,Kingsalmon,2011-11-22 17:17:00,107, Pretty steep for $1100 per guy.  You could have went on a flyin with awesome fishing for less that that.
642109,gordy28,2011-11-22 17:39:00,638, As with any question/comment - it depends We looked at a few fly ins that came under $1000 - but all involved a 8 - 12 hour drive and in many cases you got a roof over your head and not much else We have been two 3 different lodges on Lady Evelyn and the price for an American Plan was about $1200 and that doesnt include guides or a boat as nice as we will get at Brennan Harbour Anyway- ideally this is one of many annual trips our group will embark on as the kids get older - so any comparative places/trip ideas are welcome Cheers
642286,ctdd2006,2011-11-23 03:34:00,531,"  pm me closer to the date....I'm usually floating about there that time of year as well!  Good call on the upgraded boat....can get rough out there at times.  1100 hundred aint bad at all for the boats and your meals too!  Sounds like a hassle free week to me.  Enjoy.  The resort looks really nice, but considering I'm local to the area I've never been there overnight.  ps. you're only a mile or so from a liquor store too!"
