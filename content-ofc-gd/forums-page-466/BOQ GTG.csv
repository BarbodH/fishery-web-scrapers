If trolling isn't paying off, it's something you can pull out of your arsenal.   We trolled everywhere with everything all weekend for one fish (albeit a nice one!).  We switched to jigging and put about 15 fish in the boat in three hours -- and some 'reel' quality ones too!  Time on the water experimenting is def. the best teacher!  And keep an open mind - jigging doesn't necessarily mean all eater-eyes.  Sometimes, you don't catch ANY eater-eyes!"
641674,young_one,2011-11-21 06:25:00,620,"This was my second time joining the BOQ GTG with our group in Perfect Vue, and it was an experience that I'll remember for years to come. For me the fishing was definitely better than last year, consider I skunked on trolling and only manage to jig one cigar walleye in 2010.  The weather in the past weekend would certainly give many anglers the red light to come down to BOQ, but for those dedicated anglers and our friends on OFC, many made it with the dream to reel in their personal bests, and a shot at becoming a member of the elite 10LB+ Walleye Club.  All the fish were caught less than 30 FOW, above the kill zone. I kept a few eater fish and all the big girls went back swimming strong.  12.4LB Walleye Release Video (HD 1080P for best quality)   Photographer Credit: Lincoln   Charter boats putting a show for us.   Beautiful skyline, with more than enough walleye chop   Sharing a good laugh with friends I see once a year, and my PB. 9.1LB   Mother nature taking a break after a full day of 40KM+ winds   ""walleye weather""?

Later I handed over the big fish trophy with envy   Grandpa Eye   30""   The reason fisherman comes to BOQ   No more guessing game, 12.4LB (biggest fish coming out of my boat)   There's a reason my truck was the last car in the parking lot   secret is out, RedEye Shad!   a 'small fish' I am spoiled by BOQ   Clean and healthy looking   The carpet on that part of the gunnel is officially the place to rub your trophy slime   27""   Result of having sharp hooks   The money shot   What a great weekend!   Thanks to all those who came out to our get-to-gether at Perfect Vue. A weekend of great companies, lots of laughter, excellent eating and catching a few fish. Can't wait until next year!"

642058,ccmtcanada,2011-11-22 15:38:00,7971, Shouldn't you be writing a fishing report Will??? LOL
642068,fishnsled,2011-11-22 15:59:00,3520, Spent last night just uploading pics! Note to self - resize the larger file sizes before up loading. Most likely will be Wednesday evening before I get the report done up Cliff.
642182,young_one,2011-11-22 21:51:00,620,"CCMT & fishnsled, bring your jigging rods next time! You won't regret it!"
642242,Moosebunk,2011-11-23 01:00:00,3970,"Sick!  Never tried jiggin' there, except through the ice.  Remember one year seeing TonyB and AaronS pound numbers of fish jiggin' but there weren't many with size.  Looks like you guys plucked a few decent trophies out of the resident eaters.  Serious fun, and good for you all to make a tough weekend for many, look easy!"
642495,LeXXington,2011-11-24 00:35:00,1928,Very nice going.  It was a tough weekend but looks like you hit a pot of Gold!
