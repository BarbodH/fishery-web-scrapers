643196,lew,2011-11-26 12:47:00,12766,"Some great pictures there Mike and they'll bring back fond memories for many years to come.  My dad's been gone for 14 years now and like you, I was very close to him and I think about him probably dozens of times a day. I've got lotsa pics of both him and my late Mom and they sure help with the loss.  Out in the workshop above the bench I've got a favorite picture of my dad and I hung his favorite pike lure beneath it. I've also got his old tape measure sitting beside the picture.  Crazy stuff maybe, but when I'm working at the bench and his picture and a couple of his favorite things are there, it sorta keeps him close to me.  You'll also figure  a way to keep your dad with you too."
643208,Handlebarz,2011-11-26 13:15:00,3790,Lew my father was the same way he had a picture of his father on his dresser beside him since I can remember and before it was on the dresser it was on the wall beside him. I have a few things that I am going to do and I know like yourself I will always have him with me.
641999,Handlebarz,2011-11-22 12:47:00,3790,"Sorry to my OFC family for not posting this before today but it was just t hard to get it up on here for me dont know why but I think the comments are gonna hurt help and heal at the same time. I think I just could not read them until later today. Well here is what I came up with.  Thanks to everyone here for the well wishes for Dad its so hard to post that he had passed away Sunday November 20th in my arms with my mother and Wife at his side this was the most peaceful thing that has ever happened to me. I am so sad to have lost dad but would not trade this journey for anything not even another day on the water. His last breath was a long inhale that he will hold forever and his last sight was my mom I will share the other details one on one another day with each OFCN family member when we are on the water or teh phone or sitting by the fire. All I can say is he was the best friend and biggest supporter of me and my family. He will be missed big time but never forgotten this has made myself stronger as a father I know things I need to do and just hope I can be half as good as he was.  RIP dad  Our last fish together a little one but he was so happy as he could reel it in.   He loved every fish he ever caught here he is looking at this monster of slime before the above pic   Rigging up for some walleye earlier that morning   I will put something together some other day I just wanted to say thanks to my OFC family members for the emails, calls and time on the water talking about dad over the last 6 years whith his battle with cancer."

642046,fishnsled,2011-11-22 15:14:00,3520,"Very sorry to hear of your loss Mike, way too much of this going on this year. I was there for my Dad's last breath back in May and his last attempt to look up at me...man this is difficult to type. Just want you to know, as you already do, there is a great bunch of people here that will help get you through this difficult time.  It does get easier as time goes on. I thought it was a bunch of Bull when I was told this, but 6 months later, to the day of my Dad's passing, I now can say it's true. There will be certainly lots of ups and downs but just take it one day at a time. Knowing your Dad is at peace and no longer suffering will help with your sorrow. The good times and memories will never leave you, they will bring much comfort in the days, weeks, months ahead.  Again, I'm very sorry for your loss and my deepest condolences to you and your family."
