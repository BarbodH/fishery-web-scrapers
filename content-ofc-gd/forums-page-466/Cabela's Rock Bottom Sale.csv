642201,Rizzo,2011-11-22 23:14:00,4754,man I hate seeing ads after I've already bought
642218,landry,2011-11-23 00:07:00,1005,That's hardly rock-bottom!???
642290,bucktail,2011-11-23 03:46:00,1857,I hate seeing stuff I want on sale when I'm broke!
642315,Billy Bob,2011-11-23 12:38:00,5865," Oh, the prices on many looked pretty good but if you have better deals, PLEASE share with our fishing friends. We all need to save a buck these days. And with Christmas coming I thought this might be helpful."
642317,mercman,2011-11-23 12:43:00,7054," Thanks Bobby Good to see you are still out there being our finacial watchdog The way i look at it is, a buck left in my pocket, is better than in theirs."
642443,landry,2011-11-23 21:39:00,1005, Just saying - those are not rock bottom yet - wait until Jan/Feb and Cabelas usually has crazy deals on electronics and map chips. I can see you are trying to help - I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry. Landry
642447,Billy Bob,2011-11-23 21:52:00,5865," No offense was taken.......just saying to post deals if you have some, especially before Christmas....."
