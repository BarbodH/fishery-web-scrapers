I dont think i'm suffering from winternet either....its summernet with the freekin' temps we have here at the moment...records being broken for this area daily."

642713,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-24 21:02:00,2582,The real trick is to live like I do.  When you got nothing worth stealing burglars aren't really a problem
642719,bigugli,2011-11-24 21:36:00,6138,"If they break in and find nothing worth stealing, they trash your place in spite. Happened in our neighbourhood a couple of years back. Still cost the family thousands in home repairs."
642720,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-24 21:43:00,2582,  There you go spoiling my perfect plan Bruce  Maybe I'll leave something vintage out for them...like my pocket fisherman... that should be enough to make them happy
642767,Twocoda,2011-11-25 00:14:00,4130,Pocket Fisherman???? oh the memories....where do you live ....ill leave a note ...lol
