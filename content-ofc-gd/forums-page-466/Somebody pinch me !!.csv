641603,ChrisK,2011-11-21 00:54:00,2772,"This weekend was simply amazing. Numbers were down but the fish we did catch were huge and they fought hard taking to the air cartwheeling and tearing up and down the pools like freight trains. Some hit gently barely moving the float while others literally tore the pole from your hands and removed the fly from the tippet instantly in some of the most aggressive strikes I've seen this fall. I think it had a lot to do with the crystal clear cold highly oxygenated water. We took this picture and there was some silt in the water and still you could nearly see half way across the river,wow !!  Now for some Huron bruisers !!              "
641634,msp,2011-11-21 01:56:00,1336,Nice chromers. It is something special when they smoke a fly. You and your apprentice are doing quite well.
641643,Joey,2011-11-21 02:57:00,9122,"That's awesome Chris, I'm happy for you that they cooperated this weekend.  Some real nice ones there"

641864,ChrisK,2011-11-21 22:53:00,2772,"Naaaa,just my fishing partner...more of a young steelheader in training"
641883,misfish,2011-11-21 23:29:00,29133,"First off,real nice fish there guys.  Question,are they good tasting compared to lake O fish? What I mean is,do they taste like trout,or like crap?"
641908,MJL,2011-11-22 00:21:00,2427,"Sweet chromers guys  Definitely itching to get back there in the future   When I was at Chris's place a month ago, the smoked steelhead he fed us was AMAZING"
641922,ChrisK,2011-11-22 00:32:00,2772,Lake Huron trout are delicious. If I was to keep a fish for the dinner table it would be a 3 or 4 pound fish. When it comes to smoking fish I look for the bigger ones with more fat content in the meat. They tend not to dry out so fast which allows me to keep them in the smoker for longer periods of time. Usually 4 trays of wood chips and then a good 8 hours from that point. If the meat isn't cooked enough by then I put a cover over the smoker to increase heat for another hour or two.
641929,misfish,2011-11-22 00:39:00,29133, I prefer my smoked fish real dry.Just me.  Thanks for the reply Chris. Going to try to get out that way.   Thanks again for the post.
641973,ccmtcanada,2011-11-22 03:36:00,7971,Another awesome report Chris!  I really hope I get down there again before it freezes up!
