641822,kemper,2011-11-21 21:24:00,2232," mmmmmmm kelt. Probably tastes about as good as the brown that's beside it.  Wasn't intending that you roped it Mike!  Too bad it spilled, stuff probably works better than brownie roe  I'm joking, for anyone who is humor-blind."
641832,solopaddler,2011-11-21 21:56:00,8605," I know that.    As mentioned earlier the ""sportsman"" who caught it scooped up all the loose eggs from the ground and chummed them in the run he was fishing.  This after I jokingly told him he should do that, and in the same breath informed him the practice was illegal.  He was part of a group of 12 guys from New York city. All of them lined up in a row chucking, ducking and flossing to their hearts content with Aerosmith playing on a boombox in the background."
641837,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 22:00:00,8333,Izaak Walton would be so proud.
641838,kemper,2011-11-21 22:03:00,2232," Ah yes, the sounds of pursuing natural fish in their environment. thwack! ""comin down!"""
641931,streamerstripper,2011-11-22 00:41:00,28," ^^ This.  I get tired of the fly vs. gear argument and stereotypes (a bunch of fairy-wand, micro-fly greenies vs. redd-raping meat fisherman) - as stated above, there are idiots who fish both ways (and in the case of many LO tribs, an interesting combo of the two!).  My point in my first post was that why would only fly anglers care about a dead atlantic - are they the only ones who care about the resource?  No - there are many 'fly anglers' who would happily snag that same fish and throw it on the stringer while I know there are many gear anglers that would happily release it back into the river...  Kingsalmon that sucks that someone was a prick too your kid, not cool - but if he had been toting an ugly stick and spinning reel (instead of expensive fly gear), would you still spray it all over the net and try to push a stereotype?"
641935,solopaddler,2011-11-22 00:48:00,8605,It never ceases to amaze me how wound up some people get over nothing.
641944,sconceptor,2011-11-22 01:12:00,146,"Ernie did up the MudHole MHx 1203 10ft 6-12lb for me.  I was hit up by one big old beat up male today.  The rod is nice and I look forward to the next time the water is high and fish are more agressive!  Overall pretty slow down there.  I also caught somebody's poor fishing line that had broke off above the float with a shaker on.  The fish was deep hooked and bleeding, but still very spunky. I let it go since I only hooked the float, not the fish, but wonder if it would survive with the hook still in it's throat?"
641945,solopaddler,2011-11-22 01:22:00,8605,"  Very cool, that's exactly the blank I'm considering. Does it have a very fast action? Hopefully so...  Crazy snagging the shaker with the line hanging out of it. I probably would have dispatched it and brought it home if it was hooked that deep, but hey you never know."
641969,Kingsalmon,2011-11-22 03:22:00,107," I wasn't trying to push a stereotype.  I was only reflecting on my experience from last week and it wouldn't matter if the guy had a spinning rod, float rod or fly rod.  Personally I could care less who keeps a fish and who doesn't.  If you are within the legal limit, so be it,  Case closed."
641971,Kingsalmon,2011-11-22 03:27:00,107," Solopaddler,  Next post and you hit 6000!  Wow, congratulations.  Your posts are always informative and entertaining.  Thanks"
642168,torco,2011-11-22 20:39:00,656,"We all know you shouldn't stereo type any angler based on the method chosen. That same fly angler could be a gear angler the next day.  Crazy that they kept an atlantic but at the sametime its hard to be surprised with all the craziness we see during salmon and trout runs.  Nice fish Solo, I never get tired of reading your reports and have learned a lot so far."
642256,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-23 02:13:00,0,"personally i find the tactic stereotypes funny, and obviously like in any stereotype there are little nuggets of truth to them as much as their are exceptions.  .  speaking of which, what's with musky guys and what are they trying to make up for?  "
642339,torco,2011-11-23 14:33:00,656,"  I find some of them amusing but some people get really worked up and really believe in it. Don't even get me started on those musky guys,  haha."
642353,danbouck,2011-11-23 16:08:00,4380,Gear guy???
642433,Billy Bob,2011-11-23 21:02:00,5865,It's not a walleye so why would someone care.....  Salmon/trout all taste like   and that's why so many are released....
642458,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-23 22:40:00,0,maybe you should try cooking it without a deep fryer there bubba.
641606,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-21 01:02:00,0,   cool
641616,MJL,2011-11-21 01:24:00,2427,Need to find a bead that perfectly matches chummed Atlantic salmon roe  Very sweet pieces of chrome Mike
641635,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-21 02:19:00,3761,Haha you guys are hilarious   At least I can post pictures of my fish...with land/water in behind
641642,BillM,2011-11-21 02:54:00,17367,"  Wait, weren't you PS'ing out the backgrounds in your ice fishing pics last year?  :)"
641648,solopaddler,2011-11-21 03:08:00,8605,  Like all youngsters it seems as though Mike has all the answers.
641649,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 03:09:00,8333, Just the anglers named mike.
641654,solopaddler,2011-11-21 03:35:00,8605,  Thanks Rob.
641656,Moosebunk,2011-11-21 03:50:00,3970,"This post kinda ended up all over the place eh Mike?  Lantic shmantics!  I kinda like that reel you got there.  You prefer the fatter spools on that type of reel for tribbin' or, everything fishing, Mike?"
641659,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-21 03:56:00,3761,"Ya I guess it did lol, Ah well I have fun on here.  Hope ur rivers turn muddy  Seriously tho I mean no harm..."
641660,solopaddler,2011-11-21 03:57:00,8605,"  Just like it for casting hardware for salmonids as it casts a country mile.  Not a great reel by any means, but it's good for the intended purpose.  The stock drag on the US Reel isn't that great and needs to be tweaked with better washers.  A similar reel with an oversized spool and perhaps a slightly better stock drag is the Pfleuger Arbor."
641663,sconceptor,2011-11-21 04:15:00,146,"The US reel's only 50$ marked down from 150$ at Cabela's right now......I was thinking of it.  Was wanting to order some of those long cast mepps, at that the only site i can find that'll order them.  Anybody down near Niagara want to put in an order directly to Mepps and pick it up at the mail to store in Niagara NY. I could buy about 60$ worth of long casts from their site which only does US sales.  After that either ship it to me or bring it up to BruceCounty?"
641665,solopaddler,2011-11-21 04:33:00,8605," Scott, Cabelas has them cheap, but only the 180 size. Overstock Bait has the 240SX on sale for $50. Good price, but honestly that's probably all the reel is worth.  http://www.overstockbait.com/US_Reel_SuperCaster_p/240sx.htm  The 240 is ""okay"" but a bit on the heavy side. The 230 is the best all around size for steelhead.  As far as the spinners go if you place the order I'd be happy to deliver them for you.  I'm most likely headed up on Wednesday this week if you're around.  Cheers"
641668,sconceptor,2011-11-21 05:04:00,146,"Thanks,  However, I did try to place an order with Mepps, and it wouldn't let me do the sale, since I needed an American address for my VISA.  Where in do you pick up the Mepps Longcasts?  I don't think I'll be getting to the city for a few weeks.  I like the looks for their Little Wolf spoons, which I picked up 3 of.  I have some Silver Fox Vibrams, but wish they'd cast further.  I also added a few Len Thompson's, a few Rapala size 5 rattle traps, 3 pack of small Big O Cordells, and a few cleos.  It's dam expense tossin lures, either snagging up and breaking off, or hammered and bitten off.  Put 4 new ones in the drink on Thursday, (2 fish, 2 snags).  I'm not going to use 8lb flouro tippet anymore, might bust out the 15lb flouro from my bass gear, might just do the straight braid. It is pretty exciting fishing though!  I have 4 white stradic 2500s, which I rotate between bass/walleye/trout rods.  I really don't need a new spinning reel.  Heck, I've even got a Diawa SS, on a bottom bouncing eye rod, just begging for more use.  I'm on nights, and will fish as much as possible this week.  I'll try to get out Wednesday!  Ernie got my rod done up in 1 day.  I'll try it out this morning!"
641672,solopaddler,2011-11-21 05:33:00,8605,"  Just call Mepps directly and explain the situation, they'll let you place the order.  It can get expensive for sure. Can't believe you're using 8lb tippet though. I'm running 20lb braid with 12lb tippet and that seems to be working okay. My buddy was hitting fish on straight braid, no tippet on Saturday. Don't forget its a reaction bite.  Not surprised about Ernie, he works super fast, sometimes too fast.  Hopefully he did a good job for you.  Which blank did he build up? You'll have to let me know how you like it.  And I know all about nights. When I fish Wednesdays I'm leaving the office at 5am after coming off a 16 hour shift.  Sleep is overrated."
641709,Kingsalmon,2011-11-21 13:44:00,107," I was not implying that gear guys don't care.  I release 99% of my fish and I'm sure most of the gear guys do as well, but on this particular river the fly guys are the majority and they look at you as though you killed their mother when you rope a fish.  My son caught his first trout this weekend and I had to move after some fly guy with an uber expensive Orvis rod and reel kept giving us attitude about keeping a fish.  He probably just wanted to get in on our spot, but I wasn't really happy about this guy talking crap in front of my kid.  We just moved downstream and found some other fish.  The fact that a fly guy caught that Atlantic probably made everybody high-five each other on the river.  But if a gear guy caught that fish, there would have been a whole different attitude."
641711,craigdritchie,2011-11-21 13:52:00,1586, I'm still trying to get over the fact someone thought this was good eating.
641713,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-21 13:58:00,0,"I wouldn't eat any of them either, nor anything else from SO streams--best to catch-and-release anyway (but oops, now I'm exposing my predilection vis-a-vis angling ethics)."
641717,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-21 14:11:00,0,"   OH OH I think we are broaching a touchy subject here, one that, I may very well wade into later. Suffice to say trash talk on the river doesn't generate good will. Let a young boy keep the odd trout--no harm done (it's a ""teachable"" opportunity--more fathers should teach their children well, as the song goes). As far as ""gear guys"" are concerned, they take too many liberties (how long of a drift??????? Really????) just as, admittedly, some fly fishing guys--really makes for an unpleasant outing. But I've come across some really decent float guys--it's like any community (neighbourhood, forum, whatever) there are always a few who have to piss in the pond and it's left to more altruistic people to ensure the continued vitality and health of the community, river bank etc."
641721,BillM,2011-11-21 14:39:00,17367,"I like the fly guys who stand in the middle of the run tossing shot and egg sucking leeches under strike indicators.  If that's not purist fly fishing, I dunno what is  :)"
641725,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-21 14:54:00,0," I don't think anyone is making any claim regarding ""purists."" As I've said, each community is populated by idiots."
641727,Kingsalmon,2011-11-21 15:04:00,107,"  If that's the case, then on Friday a lot of them were there!"
641798,kemper,2011-11-21 20:02:00,2232," Wait a second Bill...are you implying that the huge buck brown didn't bite with its tail?  ""FISH ON!...COMIN DOWN!"""
641811,Musky or Specks,2011-11-21 20:48:00,2710,Who would want to eat a kelt
641816,kemper,2011-11-21 21:10:00,2232," I think people are missing the boat on this one...my guess is the fish is fertilizer. If you notice, the gold has already been mined."
641817,solopaddler,2011-11-21 21:14:00,8605,"  Agreed, drinking them is much preferred.      Nope, read my earlier reply bud.  It was a fly fisherman who caught it and roped it. He had no use for the eggs, they were spilled out all over the ground."
641432,solopaddler,2011-11-20 11:37:00,8605,"Oh the horror!     (Seen on a river last week, not mine  )"
641433,Spiel,2011-11-20 11:53:00,9065,All I see is a couple of steelies.
641434,bushart,2011-11-20 11:54:00,2628,Should be good on a cedar plank on the bbq
641438,Roy,2011-11-20 12:31:00,13728,I'm not worried. It can't be one of us...there's no reel in the water.
641442,bushart,2011-11-20 12:47:00,2628,SLAM!!!!...Roy deals out the Sunday morning burn
641444,solopaddler,2011-11-20 12:57:00,8605, True.  It's easy to pick out the ones I caught. Difference this last little while it's a spinning rod on the ground for a change.              
641447,Roy,2011-11-20 13:07:00,13728,"Beauties Mike. I'm surprised the US Reel can take the water that well. Not because of the brand, because it's a spinning reel."
641448,solopaddler,2011-11-20 13:13:00,8605,  The drag is sealed so the biggest possible issue is a non issue.  I've been dunking it in silty water all fall with zero problems.  As soon as the temps dip into the minuses it'll be time to stop.
641449,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-20 13:28:00,3761,Reel in the water = stupidity....stupidity = a better reel next year to put in the water again haha
641450,TerryC,2011-11-20 13:38:00,196,Are you sure that Atlantic's not a Brown........If you look closely at the  Awww nevermind  P.S Awesome steelies again Mike.   Clarence
641453,Kingsalmon,2011-11-20 14:27:00,107,"Mmmm, Atlantic eggs.  They're ten times better than brown eggs! . I'll bet the fly fishing guys were crying big tears for that one"
641458,solopaddler,2011-11-20 14:45:00,8605," The kid's starting to chirp as he gets older. Nice.    The guy who caught it was a fly fisherman. When he landed it, it spilled its load of eggs all over the ground.  I jokingly said to him you should pick those up and chum them where you're fishing, not really being serious.  I turn my head a few minutes later and see him hurling handfuls of eggs into the river. LOL!"
641472,rocheleauc,2011-11-20 16:11:00,205, wow
641478,mk2vr6,2011-11-20 16:45:00,14, kinda looks like another NY trib travesty...
641495,12footspringbok,2011-11-20 17:35:00,459, Just curious have you ever come across one of these spinners with the green tipped blade in your travels?  Oh and nice fish as usual...
641504,solopaddler,2011-11-20 17:57:00,8605," Yep, I have a box full of them.  Any store that carries Blue Fox can order them in."
641534,streamerstripper,2011-11-20 19:58:00,28, Are you implying that only fly-fisherman care about not killing a native species that is struggling?  So your saying gear-guys don't care about the resource?  What a clever comment....
641540,12footspringbok,2011-11-20 20:11:00,459," Dammit and I only need one or two.  Looked high and low around here for them, even tried ordering some online from sites that had them listed. Have to try harder I guess. Thanks"
641541,solopaddler,2011-11-20 20:16:00,8605," I don't know man, if you're fishing them properly you're constantly losing lures. The last couple trips out I lost 9 or 10 lures. Definitely an expensive proposition.  I'm going to make my own this winter."
641554,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-20 21:50:00,3761, well really tho people wonder why there stuff breaks...
641561,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-20 22:14:00,0,   We're only missing the rod-handle-in-the-mouth shot..........  
641588,craigdritchie,2011-11-21 00:10:00,1586,Good gear doesn't break. Cheap crap does.
641593,solopaddler,2011-11-21 00:34:00,8605, I don't.    Yeah 'cause Lord knows I'd chew right through the handle and bust my rod.
