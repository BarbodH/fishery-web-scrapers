642689,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-24 19:24:00,0,"Hey Gents or Ladies:  My wife is off to a conference next week and I will have to drive her to TO Island Airport. She returns in the evening so thought to take the opportunity to fish some of the eastern tribs.  Can anyone PM me please with their recommendations (I don't need to know your secret haunts I would just like to find out what watershed you might think will produce).  Thanks all for your generosity, I would be happy to respond in kind.   JUST A QUICK SHOUT OUT TO SOME GENTS HERE FOR THEIR GENEROUS RESPONSE (there is some hope for courtesy after all).... SPAWN and AADIL and CCMT  (ascend to the domain of gentleman anglers) Best to you guys.   "

642944,bassman87,2011-11-25 16:56:00,586,i wush i knew the area so that i could point you in the right direction. hope others will though. goodluck
642955,strakey,2011-11-25 17:20:00,78,Not to many will post info on lakes or rivers (especially) since that creates to much traffic. You'd have to pm someone here for a great response. Otherwise if you have a computer use google maps on satelite and check for the river mouths out east on a map of southern ontario. You can't fish any of them past the 401 or cn tracks whatever comes first in how they parallel each other. Hope this helps
