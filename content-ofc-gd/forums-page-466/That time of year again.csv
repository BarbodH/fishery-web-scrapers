642092,lew,2011-11-22 16:53:00,12766," I got old on Sunday Skip, so a license is no longer necessary"

642102,mercman,2011-11-22 17:22:00,7054,"I will be getting my full year card and license to fish Ontario for 2012. Day passes cost too much, considering how often i fish there. I will be doing it over the internet. Should i apply now or in January?   Paul  "
642129,mikeseb,2011-11-22 18:41:00,201," I would do it now, when I applied for mine I didn't get the card in the mail for about 8 months! they will still give you a piece of paper that serves as a temp card but its better to get the card asap.  first day I went out fishing with the temp paper copy it got soaked lol I suggest keeping it in a zip-lock."
642131,fishindevil,2011-11-22 18:59:00,6254,"i was at gagnons sports in oshawa the other day and they said theres a new way they are doing it this year,that they apply directly to the ministry so there should not be a major wait time like there has been for years....so should be very speedy"
642169,Fisherman,2011-11-22 20:55:00,7201,"If you apply for the card now and don't have one for this year(2011) they will issue you a card for 2011, the year is not over yet.  If you have a plastic card for 2011, then go ahead, they will know it's for renewal and not first issue."

642214,Beans,2011-11-22 23:59:00,3339, You may have to show your drivers licence/birth certificate/or seniors card Lew...  A CO did not believe I was over 65 at Gilford but that was a few years ago...I thanked him profusely...   
642221,misfish,2011-11-23 00:11:00,29133,"  Is that when you and some other 65 year old guy, were not wearing thier mellon protectors?   Never forget that one.  he should of slapped you two with a yard stick."
642255,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-23 02:12:00,2582,I'm good until Dec31 2013...but thx for throwing this up here. I'm sure someone will have needed a reminder
642263,kickingfrog,2011-11-23 02:27:00,8333," Ya, I find with the three year option I lose track pretty easily as to when I'm due to renew."
642267,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-23 02:39:00,2582, Me too. I just wish they would come up with a lifetime license option. I'd be all over it unless it was stupid expensive...they could even pro rate it according to your age. I have never been able to figure out why it has never been considered. To me it would seem that if they got a big wad of cash up front...they might be able to invest it or use it to fund projects on the go now rather then later.
