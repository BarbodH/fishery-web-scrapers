642476,mercman,2011-11-24 00:02:00,7054,Awesome looking reel. I can imagine the $$ that it will cost.
642477,mike rousseau,2011-11-24 00:02:00,4661,that thing looks huge....  kinda defeats the purpose of a low profile reel...
642479,scugpg,2011-11-24 00:04:00,1373,That looks awesome but I heard its going to retail around $500?
642480,kickingfrog,2011-11-24 00:05:00,8333,  If that's the case I'd just get another calcutta TE.
642483,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-24 00:08:00,3761,That thing looks sweet...
642487,scugpg,2011-11-24 00:22:00,1373, Exactly. Never used the TE but I hear its the cat's meow for the round musky reels.  Not sure if there is a lefty model yet either.  Hard to beat a revo toro at half the price for a low-pro baitcaster.
642491,Roy,2011-11-24 00:27:00,13728,"Yeah, $500 and no lefties."
642499,Rizzo,2011-11-24 00:46:00,4754,"no tranks, I'll keep my 500 clams"
642502,trapshooter,2011-11-24 00:49:00,1234,"They are totally bad-a$$!!  I got to see/throw one a couple weeks back when I was visiting Lake of the Woods.  They handle pounder bulldogs no problem.  I heard the same, $500 bucks and NO lefties!!!  Boo!"
642514,Whitemikeca,2011-11-24 01:36:00,138,Looks awesome!  Glad I am a rightly and bad with money
642549,captpierre,2011-11-24 03:23:00,2521,That clip makes our freshwater fishing look like a joke. Never know what you will hook. Looking forward to spending winters down there with the boat.
642551,rides85,2011-11-24 03:27:00,37,why must lefties always be left out? It's ok though just picked up a calcutta te for next season
642564,mistaredone,2011-11-24 04:51:00,913,Looks freekin sweet!  Might have to switch hands for that one.
642590,Gregoire,2011-11-24 12:34:00,1397,"I did some reading on this reel last night and apparently a lot of hardcore musky anglers cannot wait to get their hands on this reel.  To me it just seems like the reel weighs a ton, that and the fact that it is only available in a right hand version means I will not be getting one. It does come in two speeds though, which is a nice option."
642591,scugpg,2011-11-24 12:36:00,1373,
642605,Raf,2011-11-24 13:44:00,3495,"for the muskie crowd, it's a niche reel designed to pull big blades. 42"" of pickup on each crank puts it in the class of the trinidads and the avet reels - the big difference is it comes with a level wind, while those reels do not.  sucks that there's no lefty."
642608,trapshooter,2011-11-24 13:48:00,1234,I'd pony up and buy one if there was a lefty.  Hopefully they get the picture and make LHR soon.  This reel makes the 300 curado look like a kids toy.
642610,Raf,2011-11-24 13:50:00,3495,it is a kids toy. hahaha.. it's a good reel for small stuff and jerkbaits
642611,trapshooter,2011-11-24 13:55:00,1234,exactly raf.  I only use mine for dbl 8's and top-water prop baits.  Guys who try and throw dbl 10's with a 300 curado will be disappointed after it's destroyed in 1 season.
