642576,Skipper D,2011-11-24 11:15:00,1970,"  Brian i'am not sure what season opened up north of Barrie this week , but off in the distance thru out the day you can hear hundreds of shots going off at differant times , about every fifthteen minutes it seems . What ever it is that there shooting at must be awfull hard to take down cause one shot dose'nt seem to be doing it . I was laughing to my self after a while thinking that what ever it is must look like they took a paper punch to it by now . The only thing i could come up with is some one has to be out target practicing ."
