642716,Rizzo,2011-11-24 21:20:00,4754,Heading down from Barrie this week-end to the Niagara area. Should I be bringing the boat to get a few or 5 hours of fishing in or is the river all dirty? I've been checking the forecasts in that area and sounds like its been kind of windy.
642721,Court R,2011-11-24 21:50:00,213,She's gonna be chocolate milk..Still blowing hard here and the water was getting bad this morning.
642722,Bill Shearer,2011-11-24 21:52:00,456,"I was over the peace bridge at noon today. Brown on the Ft Erie shore line, but green in the river. Winds here are still gusty, so50/50 for tomorrow"
642730,Rizzo,2011-11-24 22:27:00,4754,  sounds like Saturday is a write-off in other words. Thanks for the update
642737,sirfish,2011-11-24 22:37:00,175,Winds whipping down the lower at about 40 to 50k as of 1 1/2 hr ago it was still a nice green and fishable. Talked to a few at the ramp they had a few browns and steelies...if this keeps up its a no go saturday though.
