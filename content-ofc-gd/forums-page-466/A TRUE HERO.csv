642330,COUNTRYBOY,2011-11-23 14:01:00,130,"You're a 19 year old   kid.   You're critically wounded and dying in  the   jungle  somewhere in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam ..  It's November 11, 1967.  LZ (landing zone) X-ray.   Your unit is outnumbered 8-1 and the enemy fire is so intense from 100 yards away, that your CO (commanding officer) has ordered the MedEvac helicopters to stop coming in.   You're lying there, listening to the enemy machine guns and you know you're not getting out.  Your family is half way around the world, 12,000 miles away, and you'll never see them again.  As the world starts to fade in and out, you know this is the day.  Then - over the machine gun noise - you faintly hear that sound of a helicopter.  You look up to see a Huey coming in. But.. It doesn't seem real because no MedEvac markings are on it.   Captain Ed Freeman is coming in for you.  He's not MedEvac so it's not his job, but he heard the radio call and decided he's flying his Huey down into the machine gun fire anyway.  Even after the MedEvacs were ordered not to come.He's coming anyway.  And he drops it in and sits there in the machine gun fire, as they load 3 of you at a time on board.  Then he flies you up and out through the gunfire to the doctors and nurses and safety.  And, he kept coming back!! 13 more times!!  Until all the wounded were out. No one knew until the mission was over that the Captain had been hit 4 times in the legs and left arm.  He took 29 of you and your buddies out that day. Some would not have made it without the Captain and his Huey.    Medal of Honor Recipient, Captain Ed Freeman, United States Air Force, died last Wednesday at the age of 70, in Boise, Idaho  May God Bless and Rest His Soul.  I bet you didn't hear about this hero's passing, but we've sure seen a whole bunch  about Lindsay Lohan, Tiger Woods and the bickering of congress over Health Reform.  Medal of Honor Winner Captain Ed Freeman  Shame on the media !!!    Now... YOU pass this along.  Honor this real hero.    Please.   <BR style=""mso-special-character: line-break""><BR style=""mso-special-character: line-break"">"

642391,Billy Bob,2011-11-23 18:11:00,5865,Words cannot explain how proud I am living in this country because of these brave men and women....and I'm sure you Canadians have many similar military personal like Capt Ed Freeman to thank also.  I personally did not serve in the military as I had a very high draft number during the Vietnam War....but I could of joined and not serving my country is a regret I have to live with. But I'm a proud father of son who is serving in the U.S.A. Air Force. Since he is not too far away (7hours) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base we get to visit him during the holidays. Last year and this year we had mock Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners that we cooked for him and some of his Air Force buddies....at the end of the day they are thanking the wife and I for a home cooked meal and I'm thinking they should not be thanking us and I only wish I had the capability to do more for them as a gratitude for their sacrifices.  So what I'm trying to say is tomorrow PLEASE remember the military at the Thanksgiving table because it's them that maintain the peace that both our great countries enjoy.   Bob
