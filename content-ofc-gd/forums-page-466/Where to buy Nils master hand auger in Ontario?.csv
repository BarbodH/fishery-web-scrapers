642060,kickingfrog,2011-11-22 15:39:00,8333,Where to buy Nils master hand auger in Ontario? They seem to be hard to come by.
642064,Roy,2011-11-22 15:50:00,13728,"BPS has them, Rob."
642065,Roy,2011-11-22 15:51:00,13728,Oops sorry...I was on the Cabela's site.
642073,kickingfrog,2011-11-22 16:08:00,8333,Ya I found them on Cabelas site but with the shipping and duties I figured I could drive to just about anywhere in ON and still some out ahead.
642076,scugpg,2011-11-22 16:19:00,1373,Call Angling Outfitters 519-539-5494 I think they have or are getting them in. If not they may know where to track them down.
642171,scugpg,2011-11-22 21:02:00,1373,They have them in stock
642366,paulyboy83,2011-11-23 17:19:00,54,"I'd call Joss at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock and reserve one.  They don't last long in there and sell out fairly quick.  I've got a 4.5"" I bought from there 3 yrs ago.  Best investment I've made so far.  Now I need a bigger one with Nippissing right on my doorstep.  It might be hard squeezing the walleye and pike through a 4.5"" hole."
