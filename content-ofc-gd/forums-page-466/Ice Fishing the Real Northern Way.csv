641845,solopaddler,2011-11-21 22:14:00,8605,Now I know why sasquatches are so rare these days.  The damn northerners are clubbing them all to make gloves.
641851,Remastered,2011-11-21 22:28:00,143,There are two things us northerners enjoy in life. A hot cup of coffee and clubbed animals!

641891,Rod Caster,2011-11-21 23:53:00,5784,"  Hahaha.   That certainly looks cold, Dave.  I was chilly today it was only -10. I wish I had sasquatch genes."
641972,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-22 03:35:00,10439,I want a set of those gloves!!! They look pretty warm. A set of seal skin boots to go along with them would be nice too.
641978,solopaddler,2011-11-22 03:40:00,8605, They look big.  You know what they say about big gloves and big boots.....
641996,Basskicker,2011-11-22 12:14:00,421,"I actually own a pair of those gloves. You can purchase them ($350.00) in Alderville, Ontario on the reserve.  They are AMAZINGLY WARM...  My wife purchased them for me last christmas....if I could find a jacket/pants/boots I wouldn't hesitake"
