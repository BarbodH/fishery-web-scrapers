There is just something about going out on cold November mornings and smashing fresh chrome steelhead that is so satisfying  This has been an exceptional fall with lots of hard fighting steelhead for everyone, and I'm sure the fun will continue until ice-up!  I still consider myself a newbie when it comes to steelheading and I've still got a lot to learn. Bait choice, different rigs and setups, depth, time of day, temperature... so many factors that can make the difference.  Most of my fish have come on roe bags this fall, but I would like to concentrate on getting into jigs and flies. It's hard to switch up when you're doing so well though. But we'll see how it goes.  Enjoy the pics... some of the best photos this fall came from this past weekend. Couldn't have been possible without a great netman and cameraman (Thanks Vic!)                                               This little guy was insane! I hooked up with this fish and fought it for about 5-10 seconds. It then wrapped me up in wood and broke me off at the leader. I retied and a few drifts later, get another fish on. I land the fish and see a line coming out of it's mouth. This was the same fish that broke me off a few casts before! While examining the fish, I realized that there was another line and hook coming out of it's mouth. So in total... there were 3 lines, 3 hooks and 3 roe bags in the mouth of this small steelhead. This fish wanted to be caught so bad.  Taking everything out of its mouth.  All cleaned up and set for release.   Can anyone ID this thing? I found it swimming downstream. "

641961,solopaddler,2011-11-22 02:30:00,8605,"Beautiful fish! Nice seeing the snow on the ground, the real season is about to start."
641962,Sharkbait22,2011-11-22 02:31:00,297,Some real pruddy pictures and some hogs.  Some of the nicest I've seen here.  The bug is a larval Tipulidae - crane fly.  Yumm.
641963,danc,2011-11-22 02:45:00,4677,Very nice!! By far the best Steel shots I've seen in quite some time.
641977,ccmtcanada,2011-11-22 03:40:00,7971,Way to go!  Some amazing fish and pictures there  I wish I could go out more often....until I can I live vicariously through reports like this!!
641980,spinnerdoc,2011-11-22 04:15:00,556,Some really clean fish and shots you got there bud. Nice reel as well.
641984,Victor,2011-11-22 05:27:00,1609,"I'm not sure if I should be flattered for being labeled as a ""great netman and cameraman"" lol"
641986,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-22 06:10:00,0,wow.  some of those fish were slobs.  thanks for posting.
641987,highdrifter,2011-11-22 07:54:00,2534, Not a hellgrammite.  Hellgrammites have a visible thorax and mouth parts (mandibles).  Almost looks like a tulipae larvae (cranefly).  Do we have an expert in benthic invertebrates in the house?!
641995,fishindevil,2011-11-22 10:57:00,6254,very nice chrome man !! great pics too..
642005,12footspringbok,2011-11-22 12:58:00,459,Good pics wish I had a camera man like that.  Some of those fish are hogs... Wish there were more that size up this way!  Thanks for sharing!
642008,Jon,2011-11-22 13:10:00,209,Great colour in the photos! I wish mine would turn out so well.  I would agree with the cranefly larvae as well.  Jon
642021,torco,2011-11-22 13:59:00,656,"Thanks for posting, the camera work on those pictures was excellent. Some of those shots deserve to be in a magazine or calendar somewhere!"
642023,Rod Caster,2011-11-22 14:00:00,5784, oops. thanks for correction!
642194,frozen-fire,2011-11-22 22:55:00,542,"Thanks guys... After some googling, it is confirmed that it was a cranefly larvae (aquatic). Found out there are terrestrial forms as well. I was very surprised at the size of the thing. Considering mature crane flies have such small bodies and a rather thin abdomen. It just didn't seem like a match and no way I would've guessed crane fly just from looking at the larvae. I would have expected a much bulkier bodied insect."
642213,Jet,2011-11-22 23:54:00,364,"Wow I'm missing out!!! Great stuff Tony, maybe next opener!"
642229,Bassnbows,2011-11-23 00:23:00,58,Some very nice chromers there bud.
642305,Victor,2011-11-23 05:44:00,1609, nah. You're not missing anything here  I'd trade all the fish that I caught last weekend for catching 1 out your way in the REAL rivers and pools(okay maybe i didn't catch a whole lot but still haha)
