My vacations for the past 6 years have been road trips in and around Ontario including Lake of the Woods to visit the in laws (highlight was disappearing for a couple hours a day to go fish, rest of the time spent with in laws - not my favourite thing) and up to our trailer in Honey Harbour for a week or two. Jeez, a week with just my wife, having to decide between the pool or beach and Dos Equis or Corona. I'm looking forward to leaving tomorrow morning but thinking about it, I already miss my girls. Hopefully we will squeeze some deep sea fishing in at some point. I'll report back upon my return. Have a good week folks!!!"
