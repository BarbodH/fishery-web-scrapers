641933,misfish,2011-11-22 00:43:00,29133,"  Havent you heard,,,,,,,,,,,,no fighting allowed in the NHL. Fighters are no longer needed.   Nice goal."
641938,Dutchy,2011-11-22 00:59:00,416,Unreal. Late getting home from work and he already has a goal and an assist.   :worthy:
641943,tb4me,2011-11-22 01:10:00,3295,make that 1 goal 2 assists for a 3 point 12 shift game so far...wow just wow   its still early too..
641956,tb4me,2011-11-22 02:12:00,3295,and another goal from the kid...wow 4 point night so far....
641960,Rod Caster,2011-11-22 02:28:00,5784, Lemieux the 2nd. Wow.
641968,Dutchy,2011-11-22 03:19:00,416," Well Crosby's good, but he's no Phil Kessell"
642176,capt bruce,2011-11-22 21:26:00,820,"NO ONE CAME NEAR HIM !!!!! I love Sid great player but when no one will even give you a tough stick check you gonna score . Just dont think any one who watched will say he played a 2 goal game . Everyone on the ice did their best to not run in to him . Sid was playing in an allstar game , shinny on the pond NO HITTING  ""SHOULD I SAY NO CHECKING ALLOWED ""!!! Glad to see him back but who will be the guy with the B22ls to check him hard , "" NO ONE"" kid will be scoreing champ if all the games he plays are like this . If this gets any worse the nhl with have to make a rule about KISSING players around the net, no kissing the other teams best player when in 3 meters of the crease if his name is SID (humping his leg will get you a double minor). just mho ,, good your back Sid but we got Steckel , ring my bell ring my bell !!"
642209,kickingfrog,2011-11-22 23:36:00,8333,You missed the contact.
642215,misfish,2011-11-23 00:02:00,29133,"He will have his bell rung again.      Bigger/tougher players, have fallen."
642220,kickingfrog,2011-11-23 00:08:00,8333,"He may very well get an other concussion, that's their very nature. A player's individual size and strength has little to do with concussions."
642223,GBW,2011-11-23 00:15:00,8460,"once you get one, you are prone to more.  it takes less and less effort/contact to get them and this is why so many players are done and were in their prime when they called it quits.  I have had 7 or more from hockey and cannot play it anymore because of that.  I still say Avery will be the goon to go after him."
642224,misfish,2011-11-23 00:18:00,29133,"  You are correct Rob. It,s the part where they dont keep thier heads up, and see whats coming. His last one was a hit to the boards,was it a hit from behind or boarding call? it wont matter when it happens again.  Nice to see he playing again,but theres no dought, it,s in the back of his mind."
642226,kickingfrog,2011-11-23 00:22:00,8333,"Avery is a coward who runs his mouth and sticks people, but concussing them is not his M.O. And you can't concuss someone skating backwards looking for a guy in a striped shirt to hide behind."
642249,mikeseb,2011-11-23 01:57:00,201," hahaha agreed, Avery is a little coward but he can really play the game when he wants to"
642380,capt bruce,2011-11-23 17:52:00,820," Not me but Im sure SID did , split the D , looked to me like two guys going you hit him NO NO not me you hit him , oh look he scored , what a great play , NOT ..."
642396,kickingfrog,2011-11-23 18:43:00,8333,Cannot hit that which cannot be caught.  btw Sid was put on his pants twice.
642399,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-23 18:50:00,0,ovech-who?  where's team ovechkin these days anyways?
642419,Jds63,2011-11-23 20:33:00,1365,awesome to see Sid back playing again
642485,Whitespinnerbait,2011-11-24 00:17:00,2038,Whiner
642489,Rod Caster,2011-11-24 00:23:00,5784,"  Hater  The proof of the pudding is in the eating. He puts up great stats and has won several championships... he's also taken his fair share of lumps. The league might coddle him when it comes to marketing and league rules but in their defence, why not? He's a great example of a fantastic hockey player."
642493,misfish,2011-11-24 00:31:00,29133,"GREAT There is only one, GREAT ONE,Even he started to WHINEwhen the good ,got tough.Oh did Mario do that too? PLAY THE GAME AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE PLAYED. You want to be a dancer,bring it to the dance floor. If I wanted to watch figure skating,I,ll visit the local rinks.     "
641787,mikeseb,2011-11-21 19:20:00,201,anyone else excited for the return of the kid?  inno I am :worthy: 
641789,Ralph Field,2011-11-21 19:36:00,1018,"I'm glad to see Sid back, I would like to see players suspended for the remainder of the season if they are caught head checking another player."
641791,mikeseb,2011-11-21 19:44:00,201,"Right with ya there buddy, theres no room for that crap in todays game.  Im all for big hits but targeting guys in the head, especially guys like sidney and alfi, is doing nothing good for the nhl except keeping talented stars off the ice thus making hockey less exciting to watch.  Inno the big boys like to hit but this head huntin stuffs gotta stop.    that is a nice LEGAL hit from always controversial Chris Pronger"
641793,Thrilla,2011-11-21 19:52:00,164,"I'm glad to see him back, maybe there will be something new to talk about on all the sports channels rather than him ""possibly suiting up"" LOL"
641812,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 20:49:00,8333,"It appears that CBC has the game on tonight. Normally  a regular season game between the island and pens would hold no interest for me, but I'm sure I'll tune it at some point tonight."
641847,woodenboater,2011-11-21 22:23:00,2277,I just hope he doesn't get his bell rung again as that would pretty well mean he's taking up golfing (or ice fishing) permanently. I would also love to see Howie Meeker guesting during intermissions once in awhile.  Hockey is at a crossroads and I'm still waiting for the brain trusts to have *that* epiphany.
641848,tb4me,2011-11-21 22:24:00,3295,"Yes this is awesome..They were calling him the worlds best player on the fan 590 today, id have to say they are right.. Im a diehard Leafer and cant wait to watch Crosby and company go to work tonight! Very excited......"
641857,danbouck,2011-11-21 22:43:00,4380, I think most fans love to watch him play. I don't watch much hockey anymore (can't stand when my team loses non stop) but when the pens play I leave it on.
641861,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-21 22:50:00,0,can't wait.  welcome back sidney.  p.s. ovechkin still hasn't won a thing.
641865,GBW,2011-11-21 22:53:00,8460,I sure hope Avery doesn't go after him...
641868,misfish,2011-11-21 22:58:00,29133," Make a bet he does? Next big hit,the kids done. Thats reality talking here.  How long did Lindros last after the run and gunners?"
641870,GBW,2011-11-21 23:00:00,8460,"Oh, I'm sure he will then he'll run and hide and let someone else drop the gloves.  Yes, I am using my outside voice here..."
641873,misfish,2011-11-21 23:05:00,29133, Wil it matter if he hides?
641875,HTHM,2011-11-21 23:09:00,4082,"Still a leafs fan, eh?"
641877,danbouck,2011-11-21 23:17:00,4380, kinda lol
641878,tb4me,2011-11-21 23:19:00,3295,"Correct me if im wrong here , but doesnt Avery play for the Rangers? The Pens are playing the Islanders..  @Dr. Salvelinus, lol awesome call on Ovenchicken...."
641885,misfish,2011-11-21 23:31:00,29133," It wont matter,someone will want to be the ""HERO"" or is that the ""ZERO"""
641888,kickingfrog,2011-11-21 23:40:00,8333,Great player.  Horrible stash.
641889,Rod Caster,2011-11-21 23:50:00,5784,I'll be tuned in. Good on the CBC to cover this. Crosby is obviously important to Canadians.  This is also a good chance for Tavares to show his talents. That kid can play!!
641896,mikeseb,2011-11-22 00:10:00,201,"the pens need som1 on there team who can ""protect"" crosby if any1 takes a run at him.  I think they need to go out and get a guy like zack stornini or george parros who can ""protect"" the talent that Pittsburghs got or its matter of time before he goes down again."
641905,Rod Caster,2011-11-22 00:18:00,5784,HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOAL
641912,tb4me,2011-11-22 00:22:00,3295,Oh my what a goal..Smoked both Dmen and stuffed it in the top of the net...Nothing short of amazing...
641913,kickingfrog,2011-11-22 00:24:00,8333,"Na, looks rusty. LOL"
641919,mikeseb,2011-11-22 00:28:00,201,holy crap that didnt take long!!!!
641921,GBW,2011-11-22 00:29:00,8460,"You are correct and I thought the NYR tonight, not the NYI.  I still stand by my comment though.  Avery being the dirty buggar he is will be the one gunning for #87."
