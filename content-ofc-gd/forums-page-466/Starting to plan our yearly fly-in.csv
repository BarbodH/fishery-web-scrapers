642204,chris.brock,2011-11-22 23:23:00,4053,"Dad, brother, cousin and myself do a yearly fly-in fishing trip. We like to hit a new place every year. I know there's alot of small operation outfitters out there, maybe a native guy with a camp he rents out, or a Mom and Pop operation without a website. We've been doing this trip for around 10 years, so we've done the online research and know of all the bigger outfitters, but we're always looking for the diamond in the rough.  We like -bigger lakes and rivers with lots to explore (ie a 5km long lake won't cut it) -portage lakes are a bonus -walleye and pike a must, lakers or brookies a bonus  will drive as far as Nakina, maybe Armstrong, or 15 hours from the GTA into Quebec  let me know if anyone has some ideas  thanks"
