643123,Fang,2011-11-26 01:46:00,1330,Well with all the posts with center pin reels I just couldn't help myself. Was talking with a long time fishing buddy this week and he tells me he found this old float reel in a box in his basement. He won it back in the 80's in the Toronto Salmon Derby. It's never seen any line and he offered it to me for the cost of a couple cases of beer. Now the last time I picked up a float reel was probably 1984-5 when I worked at a fishing store and had several invites to fish some private water out east. The customer who invited me set me up with one for the day.  I'll wander down to the rivermouth tomorrow and see if I can figure out this casting thing. I'll be sure to also bring my spinning reel in case it gets a little frustrating as I'm sure it will be!      Anyone have any info on these reels. Not sure if this is the same as the Streamside drifter but it sure looks the same.
