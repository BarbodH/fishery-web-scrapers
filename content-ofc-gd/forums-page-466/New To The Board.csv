642773,WalleyeSlayer,2011-11-25 00:39:00,26,"Hi Everyone,  Just joined this great looking board, it was recommended to me by Superdad   My name's Aadil and I live and fish on the Bay of Quinte. I attend Fleming College in Lindsay, Ontario. This past Summer I had the great opportunity to work up in Northwestern Ontario at a great lodge as Customer Service/Fishing Guide, so fishing was AWESOME all summer. Just skimmed through a couple of posts and Ben Beattie is on here!! See ya at the lodge next spring buddy, or if your down my way for ice fishing this winter!! Hope I can learn and contribute my knowledge to the board. Here are some pictures of quinte eyes I've caught in the past 2 years or so from what I have on this computer                     My PB 2 years back through the ice    Aadil"

642834,WalleyeSlayer,2011-11-25 02:49:00,26,"  Definately Bud, I have many monsters come in my backyard to spawn off our dock and canal that runs in our property ... I've caught some monsters in the Napanee River in the spring also. Just let me know when you want to fish for them in the spring and I can easily set you up. Italo did a show here, and all the spots in his show were within eye sight of our dock.  Aadil"
