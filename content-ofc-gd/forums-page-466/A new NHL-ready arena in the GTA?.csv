ROBERT MACLEOD Globe and Mail Update Published Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2011 8:59AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2011 12:01PM EST  A new 20,000-seat sports and entertainment venue is being proposed for construction north of Toronto in Markham, Ont.  Although the facility is still in the planning stages, there is no talk that the new venue - which is currently being called the GTA Centre - is contingent on the builders landing a National Hockey League tenant. The proposed site is in the Highway 407 corridor near Kennedy Road and would cost more than $300-million.  “After considerable work and discussions we’re looking forward to bringing our official proposal to the Town of Markham in the near future,” Graeme Roustan, chairman and chief executive officer of GTA Sports and Entertainment, said in a news release.  Roustan is also chairman of the Bauer hockey equipment company.  The new facility would have a seating capacity of 20,000 and would become the “premier venue” to host large community events, concerts and major sporting events, according to the news release.  Construction could begin in 2012 with a potential opening as early as 2014."

642381,Jds63,2011-11-23 17:53:00,1365,wonder why they would pick east GTA ... seems there would be greater population on the west side  another NHL team that close is unlikely ... but hey you never know
642384,GBW,2011-11-23 17:59:00,8460,The area of Warden and HWY 7 was proposed before the ACC was built.  The reason was you could have more fans get to and from the area easier because of all the HWY's there.  The talks stopped when MLSE said they needed to keep the team in the downtown core.
