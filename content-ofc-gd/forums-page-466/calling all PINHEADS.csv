642400,Harrison,2011-11-23 18:54:00,2202," Not new, but I have a Hardy 15ft that I got made 17 or so years ago.  Love the rod, I like it for big water and pier fishing, she's little on the heavy side though.  My sage 13ft and stanton are my go to's.  I put the new Okuma Raw II reel on an ole 13' team Diawa for the winter season.  I like the KISS, not the reel, but the principal.  Keep it simple stupid."
642402,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-23 19:03:00,0, Great.... I like the WET-KISS myself (too much info I'm sure)  I was actually asking about the Hardy pin real....
642404,Spiel,2011-11-23 19:17:00,9065,  I pay what'd you pay on both. Less shipping on the CTS though as I usually pick 'em up but that's $20.00 round trip in fuel.   
642405,mercman,2011-11-23 19:21:00,7054,"  As long as you are not FINE, then its ok"
642521,solopaddler,2011-11-24 01:58:00,8605,"  The Mykiss and it's predecessor the Hanson are both excellent reels. I mentioned neither because they're not making them anymore and are only available used.  I'm going to take a teeny bit of credit. Leon Hanson is a friend and came to visit me from Michigan when he was designing the reel to pick my brain  Milner reels are very highly regarded especially on the left coast where they're made and strangely enough in some of the US States like Ohio.  They're great runners, very solid, but I don't like the aesthetics of the reel.  Havn't heard a single good thing about the new Hardy."
642561,Paulus,2011-11-24 04:07:00,522,"I'm heavily influenced by Solo as I have a 2 piece 13' XST and a 3 piece 13' XST, both of which used to be his. Both are great rods. The 2 piece to me feels slightly faster than the three piece and is more sensitive. The 3 piece is much thicker through the base and offers the inestimable pleasure of straightening and pulling hooks whenever you get bored of a fish - or when you accidentally put the boots to them a little too hard . It handles big fish on big water without breaking a sweat.  I also fish with a Demarco reel, which Adam Demarco built for me. Since I've owned the reel I've felt no desire to use anything else. Maybe because my previous 2 were 4.5"" (Demarco = 5"") - a Raven SST(1) and an old Stanton. I liked both reels but the ergonomics just don't compare to the Demarco.  p.-"
642619,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-24 14:31:00,0,   LIKEWISE haven't seen many positive reviews vis. the Hardy (thanks for the confirmation).
642621,solopaddler,2011-11-24 14:41:00,8605,  Problem apparantly is they're extremely light and when used for steelhead (not their intended purpose) they will torque when placed under pressure.
642626,cuzza,2011-11-24 15:00:00,467, The Hardy float rods on their UK site are match rods designed for lighter lines and smaller fish. The specimen float rods would do the trick for steelies as would the 'Avon' rods - a friend in the UK has a couple of the new Hardy coarse rods (one float one feeder) and loves them but he's using them as intended by the manufacturer.  When you say 'torque' do you mean lock up when it gets overloaded?
642630,solopaddler,2011-11-24 15:05:00,8605, The discussion isn't about Hardy float rods. It's about Hardy float reels.
642638,cuzza,2011-11-24 15:56:00,467," My bad, sorry   - still wondering what 'torque' means (wrt to reels), new to all this 'pin lingo."
642648,BillM,2011-11-24 16:27:00,17367, Clamp down on the reel when the fish is running = torque.  Some reels under this circumstance will flex..  This is what Mike is getting at.
642653,cuzza,2011-11-24 16:48:00,467,Thanks Bill  As you were fellas
642664,BillM,2011-11-24 17:25:00,17367," You can also get the same thing if you are trying to reel in under high load.  Same idea, the reel is flexing and things that are not supposed to touch, do."
642781,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 00:51:00,556,Are you referring to the spool flexing? or the Centerpin flexing and the backplate and spool area touch each other?
642140,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-22 19:28:00,0,"  I put my centerpin outfit away in 1985 to tackle other pursuits and deliver on other obligations. Now that I am seeing a spate of pinheads (no insult here) on the river (and here)  I am curious how the sport has changed. So I want to throw this out to the more seasoned pinners among you (or anyone for that matter) and get a sense of what you deem to be the best rod/reel combo. What to your mind is the best rod Loomis Glx for example or Raven, Rainshadow etc. etc. How about the mechanics????? What is the reel of choice and why (Spahr, Islander, Kingpin, JW Young among others). As I say, I'm curious--edify me, I need to see what the community makes of this.  Looking forward--cheers!!!"

642149,kemper,2011-11-22 19:47:00,2232,"You're going to get a million different opinions on this one...  Generally it seems like the CTS has taken over from the IMX on the rod podium - I've fished them both and although they are both great sticks I honestly wouldn't trade my Rainshadow XST for either of them. Personal preference thing, more $ doesn't always mean better?  The independent reel builders are killing it lately - lots of opinions on those as well. On the river it seems like Kingpin has taken over - again not something I would pay for (but I'm cheap). I run a 3 year old Raven SST 3 - its stupid light especially paired with the XST and lets be honest here folks, a centerpin is a pretty simple piece of equipment. My only complaint is when its raining and the rim is wet I get my knuckles busted, so I'm looking to switch it up."
642205,Rizzo,2011-11-22 23:25:00,4754,"my cat is named ""Zippy the Pinhead Cat""...although most often just gets Zip or Zipzap for short. Cat went nuts first time it heard ""Pinhead"" by the Ramones, hence the name"
642206,BillM,2011-11-22 23:30:00,17367,"GLX prototype + Clough Elite!  There ya go, no one can argue that, lol!  Rods and reels are all personal preference, everyone will have a different opinion."
642210,cuzza,2011-11-22 23:40:00,467,"Picking up my first 'pin tomorrow night (Raven SST3) - I'll let you know!  I'm going to give it a go with one of my UK float rods and see how it works out.  I think all these sort of things are feel and the water you fish, a 15ft rod with tons of backbone would be a pain on a creek you can jump across etc."
642216,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-23 00:05:00,0,"CTS seems to be the choice of a lot of great lakes steelheaders although personally I think they are over-priced.  Not that they aren't fantastic but are they really HUNDREDS of dollars better than a batson?  I recently built on an mhx and i'm happy.  as far as reels, there are a lot of top notch manufacturers and independent craftsman all making top notch stuff... i make my decision based on price again because i'm not convinced a $1200 combo is that much better than a $500."
642217,MJL,2011-11-23 00:06:00,2427,"Zippy is an elitist    But he is also partial to Kingpins    In my case, looking at all the different rivers I fish (and would like to fish in the future), there isn't just 1 rod + reel combo that I'd like for everything...That in itself gives me an excuse to buy more tackle"
642239,Ralph Field,2011-11-23 00:44:00,1018,"CTS is likely the best rod and reels haven't changed much since you last fished. There are many good reels that all spin when you are on the river. I use Kingpins, but that's just me."
642241,fishinguypat,2011-11-23 00:54:00,547,  Who You Calling Pinhead?
642247,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-23 01:36:00,0, I hate cats--but I will have to make an exception for Zip-the-cool-cat if he digs the Ramones!
642250,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-23 02:00:00,0,"A good start gents I am intrigued by the responses thus far. What about rod speed (curious), as I am using (and preferring) the fast Sage Z-Axis and Sage XP (the latter as the result of Loomis GLX becoming brittle in January weather and shattering).  BTW ""personal preference"" is the outcome of a heuristic process, that is, trial and error. Which is to say that one must have gained some knowledge regarding the use, abuse, or abandonment of your equipment n'est pas?"
642253,BillM,2011-11-23 02:09:00,17367,"I like slow rods (Loomis IM6, IMX, Sage GSII, etc) they suit my style (I like to rip the fishes face off with the hookset)  But again I've fished a few XST's and CTS's and enjoy them as well.  Although I think I enjoyed the lightness more then the snappy fast action."
642254,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-23 02:11:00,0, Very helpful thanks
642257,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-23 02:14:00,0,i beleive all my blanks are moderate to slow
642258,solopaddler,2011-11-23 02:17:00,8605," Both Rainshadow XST and CTS are only available in blank form.  There's not that much difference in price.   To answer the op's question probably the CTS Affinity blanks are the current gold standard for rods, BUT they have been prone to breakage and they come from New Zealand so warranty may not be cut and dried.  MHX blanks have been mentioned. I agree 150%, for the price they are fine, fine sticks.  Gary Loomis started a new company called North Fork Composites and his new line of steelhead blanks may be the current creme de la creme.  They're certainly the priciest.  Havn't tried one yet but I'm dying to as the reviews have been spectacular.  As far as reels go there's never before been so much choice.  If I'm going to choose the ""best"" it's not going to be a mass produced reel.  The top 4 that are currently being made and readily available are imo: 1.The DeMarco made by Adam DeMarco in Ohio  2.The Frogwater made here in Ontario by Robb Marquette.  3. Ron Gardiners exquisite although pricey works of art...also made here in ON.  4. The Angling Specialties reels. You may not be fond of a centre pin reel with a drag, but no one can deny the craftsmanship.  Maybe the best of the bunch are the reels made by Al Taylor of Mississauga. Unfortunately it's next to impossible to aquire one as Al hasn't been building many lately.  Just for fun, if you're talking mass produced reels the Kingpin Imperial is pretty hard to beat.   Cheers"
642262,solopaddler,2011-11-23 02:25:00,8605,"  My choice in rods is constantly evolving.  I started out in the late 70's using a Lamiglass S-glass noodle rod and 2lb test.  The trend the last few years has been blanks with much, much faster actions.  Something I've adapted to and have come to love.  I'm currently in a stage where I'm shying away from the traditional long sticks.  I wouldn't fish a 15' plus rod these days if you paid me.  I get zero advantages with the extra length other than a sore arm at the end of the day.  13' has always been the most common length, and yeah I'll still fish a 13 at times.  Currently my 2 main go-to sticks are much shorter.  The first is a 12' CTS Affinity rated 4-8, the second is an 11' CTS Affinity rated 6-10.  Both are extremely light and extremely fast and a true pleasure to fish with."

642395,Spiel,2011-11-23 18:42:00,9065," The prices I have on them show about a $100.00 difference, give or take depending on which model."
