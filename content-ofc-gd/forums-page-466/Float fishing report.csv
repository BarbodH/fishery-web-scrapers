642824,trapshooter,2011-11-25 02:22:00,1234,Great job Emil!  It's awesome when something new fishing-wise grabs ahold of you and gets the blood pumping.
642825,ChrisK,2011-11-25 02:23:00,2772,"Yup,pretty close to locking this one down pending now on what happens next. If you all including Capt Bruce can cool yer jets we can leave this one up so Emil can continue to celebrate his great first day of pinning for steel. So what do you all say we just move on.... Good on ya Emil...Great catch !!"
642827,manitoubass2,2011-11-25 02:30:00,11391," On Rainy I see it all the time, especially with suckers, walleye and stugeon. Never bass or pike though?   "
642832,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 02:41:00,556,I've caught a few fish with marks but never with the lamprey. I saw one salmon caught from the deep at Georgean bay with one attached to it scary teeth on those things.
642838,ccmtcanada,2011-11-25 03:05:00,7971,"I hope this doesn't get locked.  I know Emil is quite experienced fishing the blue zone as I have enjoyed his reports for years seeing all those salmon and trout!  To see a long time member and fisherman get out and try new things is always great to see.  Emil, I loved the report and pictures....and your excitement and success ooze in your post  I don't consider myself great at any type of fishing, but I love getting out there and trying new things.  I have casted for bass in the slop, hunted Muskie, trolled BOQ for walleye, targeted carp, panfished with my little one etc etc etc, but I have to say I absolutely love standing in a river, float fishing for trout.  If I had to choose one type of fishing to do its that hands down.  Great report Emil!!  I wish you the same luck the next time you are out!"
642844,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 03:23:00,556,Well put...I felt what Emil was trying to say as i've tried for different styles of fishing and it is always a blast when you set out and try somethings new for the first time and get that adrenaline pumpin...simply amazing. Emil congrats and thanks for sharing....   My jets are cool
642864,Djeep,2011-11-25 04:42:00,199,those are all nice fish! I'm just getting started on the pin as well and hope to have some similar success soon
642872,solopaddler,2011-11-25 11:08:00,8605, Probably my fault for my earlier reply. In retrospect it was a mistake and not needed.  In any case kudos to Emil once again. You've got nowhere to go but down now buddy.
642887,Roy,2011-11-25 12:32:00,13728,"When Emil sets his mind to doing something, he works hard at it and gets it done. You're an inspiration to lots of guys just starting out, Emil. Thanks for sharing your success with us and don't stop."
642896,RickOnt,2011-11-25 14:04:00,669,"""When Emil sets his mind to doing something, he works hard at it and gets it done.""  That is So very very true!!  I can remember Emile's first days of Ice Fishing for Whities. He was the most determined person I have ever met,  And was quick to learn something he has a real passion for ""IceFishing"" and fishing in general.  He had a few 'Skunk' Days but now He puts as many, and usually more Fish on the Ice than anyone.  'Ice' Great to hear you are gettin' out.  Enjoy Rick"
642899,Victor,2011-11-25 14:21:00,1609,"Congrats icefisherman! Going 3/6 on your first day on the river is truly amazing. Heck, even now after trying for 2+ years I'd be happy with a 3/6 day."
642920,fishindevil,2011-11-25 15:27:00,6254,"well done emil !!! some nice fish for sure,congrats on the new experience,im sure there will be more reports from the tribs with you showing your catch"
642936,Leecher,2011-11-25 16:21:00,7832,"Attaboy Emil   Great report, fish and pics Congrats on your successful tryout Looking forward to seeing more reports from you on this style of fishing! Thanks for sharing Leechman"
642988,davey buoy,2011-11-25 20:19:00,5505,"Emil,pictures are great hopefully one day you can give me a tip or two. I'm relatively a beginner,caught two, lots of hours spent but still enjoy. I also enjoy fishing from my boat but that is two different worlds and I enjoy both, keep up the posts please,a little more good reports never hurts.davey"
643081,camillj,2011-11-26 00:02:00,1988,"Well ... all I got ta say is this ...  When I get back from chasing MARLIN ...out in the TRUE blue ... I will most certainly be walking my favourite trib(s) and be thrilled to hook into even just one beautiful chrome (coho or bow) ... to end the year in style... and though I will probably walk miles that day, chances are I will do so without even passing a single compadre.   Now .. LOCK er UP Roy before the wranglers get ugly"
642725,icefisherman,2011-11-24 22:07:00,952,"Well, after going with a friend watching him last week, then bugging Mike/Solopadler with never ending questions for advice....I went and bought new Islander Steelheader centerpin reel, 13' Streamside float rod, line, breathable waders, wader boots, etc....all from Josh in Woodstock...spent too much with the big question can I actually use all this stuff and can I learn this totally new to me type of fishing....I knew I'd like doing it...so today was the test day ha ha ha....after hours of watching on the web various casting methods....armed with just 4 roe bags I was given last week I landed on the river...I cut them split them in half and re-tight them again. This way I had more to work with... Must have done 2000 casts today...my right arm is hurting me big time ....but I got fish...6 of them...all nice size bows./..landed 3 of them...average size 6-7 Lbs...I catch them all the time from the boat in the Blue Zone all summer long but with the downrigging rod/reel and strong braid line/hook they have no chance....here ...waoooo....what a show, acrobatics, trashing....runs....you name it...learning how to use the rod and reel on the go....loved the whole thing....and I am HOOKED big time now ha ha ha...need few more weeks and couple trips with some pros to correct some mistakes that I am sure I am making...and then....those bows better be watching for me Anyhow....few shots from today with my cell phone....          Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
642726,BillM,2011-11-24 22:12:00,17367,"Man, that one looks like a coho."
642727,Kingsalmon,2011-11-24 22:16:00,107, The second pic and last pic are definitely of a coho.  Good job for your first outing!
642728,icefisherman,2011-11-24 22:21:00,952,"Yes Bill I did see the tail...not sure though....see if other experts can comment on it....didn't expect to catch a Coho today in the river for sure  Yes second and forth pictures are of the same fish...with the last one releasing it.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
642732,solopaddler,2011-11-24 22:31:00,8605,"Emil, I'm equally blown away by your instant success and very very happy for you!!  Truly outstanding.  And yeah, it appears as though one of your fish was a coho."
642735,rocheleauc,2011-11-24 22:35:00,205,"nice bows and ho  Very nice for your first outing, nice pictures too.  Good job!"
642740,icefisherman,2011-11-24 22:46:00,952,"Hey Mike,  Comments like that coming out of you the float fishing Pro you are ....well lets just say I just hope and pray to get lucky enough to go fishing together with you so I can learn more in person....thank you for the tremendous patience answering my questions.... I may not always get so lucky but I think I can manage this new type of fishing....pratcise and more practise....that is all  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
642746,capt bruce,2011-11-24 23:00:00,820,"Dude next time you out in the blue do what I do for good long time clients (speaking as one who were one of the  first to go there , many 50 /75 fish days, have boated many high teens fish 17 / 18 pounds  ), 15 foot rods sorry guys still useing lamiglass (sp), mouching reel ,10 pound line , boat out of gear , lots of fun and none of that river , creek nuttiness. You will never see me as long as I have a 40 foot boat standing in what to they say ""FROG WATER"" flossing fish . Just my ho , not to step on any ones redd , to many all ready have .... delete this Roy if you must but still I have many guys who love this because of the nonsence that they have found on the tribs . This post is not gonna get me any friends . But I know at least one guy on this board that with his family (dad , granddad etc. put fifty in the boat and lost as many , and never had to fight with some guy who hogged their spot ..."
642748,misfish,2011-11-24 23:22:00,29133,"Emil I feel your excitment.I too ,am totally loving the NEW.  Bruce, I hear ya,(great times)but up here you look for your own spots and some you get pointed to by those that trust.(yah theres community spots still). Nothing like down in the southern tribs though. I have found spots(with lots of leg work) that you will not see a soul.  Again Emil,great job.  Many here have helpped me get into this new style,well from what I have seen,it,s an old style ,thats just gotten bigger."
642750,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-24 23:24:00,0,Nice work--congrats.    
642751,solopaddler,2011-11-24 23:30:00,8605,  Each to their own Bruce. Sorry for my earlier reply.
642752,Dozer,2011-11-24 23:35:00,896,"Welcome to the addiction, this is just the beginning"
642757,Kingsalmon,2011-11-24 23:48:00,107,"Bruce, I too fish the blue zone and let me tell you that I'd rather catch three in the river than fifty out there.  If your fishing light lines out there, the fish are dead when you release them.  If you fish salmon gear, realing in a bow is about as sporty as realing in a wet sock.  So again, icefisherman good job!"
642763,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-25 00:03:00,0,"""This post is not gonna get me any friends.""  You called it Bruce...."
642764,denisk,2011-11-25 00:04:00,163,gotta love float fishing
642771,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 00:33:00,556,"  In retrospect my earlier responce was uncalled for. Every one must be able to give their opinions without being bashed for it. I apologize.  As for Emil, hey man you did way better on my first time on the water.Cheers"
642779,misfish,2011-11-25 00:50:00,29133,"  He may come accross as that to you,but like many here,it,s thier feeling on what the fishery is.   Im not defending Bruce here,as he can for himself,but to call him an a$$ well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You take it up with him.  Many comment thier thoughts here,but being called an a$$ is not called for.IMO  I am the member in which he spoke of,and can tell you,our family enjoyed our time out with bruce, he is one of the nicest guys you would meet.Just like me at times,I say things that make others say yer an ass. Do I care???????????NOPE."
642783,Joey,2011-11-25 00:52:00,9122,"Wow Emil, who knew   Nice fish there"
642796,icefisherman,2011-11-25 01:15:00,952,"Ha ha ha Joey, think if I only had your camera and top photographic skills  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
642797,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 01:16:00,556,"  He's a big boy I'm sure he can handle himself. Perhaps calling him an ASS is uncalled for. To assume people fishing creeks and rivers, ""flossers"" is utterly ignorant...and that means your included in that as well...as I and a lots here. So he does not like to fish that style that's ok too. I know everybody has their opinion on the fisheries: river rishing, Charter fishing or anything that's related to it.  PS: I never did get a reply from you after getting a message from you out of the blue."
642800,esoxansteel,2011-11-25 01:18:00,1307,"  The scenery out in the Blue Zone must be outstanding, looking at blue water all around you for miles, see any deer or grouse out in 300 feet of water, id rather catch 3 fish in a beautiful creek than 50 off the rigger anyday, thats my preference only, might not make any friends from the boating committee, but im sure the river runners will know theres more to fishing then catching fish"
642803,misfish,2011-11-25 01:24:00,29133, You answered my question.    Good fishing Emil.ENJOY
642805,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-25 01:30:00,2582,Just thought I'd throw my 2 cents in before this one gets locked.  Thx for sharing your new experience with us Emil. I'm happy you gave something new a go and are enjoying it.  That's all I got.  Again Emil...great job
642807,spinnerdoc,2011-11-25 01:34:00,556,"I did. Anyway it still stands, any time your in the Mississauga area your welcome to see it   Emil that one fish with the bite mark, looks like a big lamprey got to it. Has any one actually got a fish in the rivers with them lampreys on?"
642815,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-25 02:02:00,0,   That's my concern--and generally without explanation. Rather a good to-and-fro as it were and air things out as adults are wont to do every so often.
