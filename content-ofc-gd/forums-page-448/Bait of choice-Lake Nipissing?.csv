658430,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 12:59:00,2690,"Let's put it this way...we fished for two full days, and, a half day on two others.  Juli never changed her lure!  Silver Swedish Pimple with orange tape tipped with a full minnow. I also had pretty good success with a silver/black W5 Rapala Jiggin Rap, tipped with a minnow head on the lower treble.  Good Luck!"
658440,kickingfrog,2012-01-20 13:38:00,8333,Jigging rap is where I usually start. I figure it's somewhere in the middle and then I'll go more or less aggressive based on what I see on the finder.  I'll let you know how Saturday goes.
658451,Nipfisher,2012-01-20 14:21:00,2449,"  Shiners, chubs, and dace all working."
658453,Rod Caster,2012-01-20 14:27:00,5784,"I always liked a 4inch, pure silver jigging spoon. Mine are made by Jaxon and looks like a smelt or big shiner. Works wonders especially when the fish are aggressive."
659172,kickingfrog,2012-01-22 20:28:00,8333," Well for Saturday the jiggin rap worked very well. Of course I had one on at least one rod 90% of the time yesterday, so there is an element of self fulfilling prophecy to it. I don't tip mine with bait, but it's hard to say where that made a difference or not. The more active lures sure drew in fish but the rap tagged the most fish. I only used a set line while eating, but my brother used one more often and it really was a pita. Even with large shiners the perch where robbin' him left and right. We had good action from sun up to about 11am and then things picked up around 3 but slowed down by 4pm even though it was sunny a light out past 5pm."
