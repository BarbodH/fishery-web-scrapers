657875,HTHM,2012-01-18 22:34:00,4082,"Let me guess, Billy Bob, you have a Grumman  :dunno:"
657877,Billy Bob,2012-01-18 22:36:00,5865, LOL....you sir are smarter then what they told me here....LOL...
657878,discophish,2012-01-18 22:40:00,392,"What you need to do is take a seat at the helm of both boats, and have a fan blown towards your face at a gale force setting, then comparatively at a gentle breeze setting.  Once that evaluation is done, put both hands on the wheel and have a 5 gallon bucket of water splashed on you.  If your hair is still neat and tidy, I would totally go with that boat!  ... after all, it is winter, right?!  Good luck with the decision.  I'm sure both boats will serve you well.  Very exciting time!"
657897,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-18 23:07:00,10439, Fixed it fer ya BB.
657901,solopaddler,2012-01-18 23:14:00,8605,Thanks for the laugh   On the boat front unless something unforeseen happens I'll be going with the Smokercraft.
657903,Billy Bob,2012-01-18 23:16:00,5865, LOL....THANKS....That's what I wanted to say but didn't want to offend anyone....
657904,Drew_10,2012-01-18 23:21:00,111,I've fished out of a couple 16' smokercrafts in the past and was really impressed.  They are built like tanks!  Never been in a princecraft so I can't comment.  Best of luck with your purchase!
659367,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 13:03:00,5865,SO......which one did you decide on ? ? ?
659376,Roy,2012-01-23 13:15:00,13728, Mike's decision is more than halfway down page two! Pay attention.
659382,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 13:50:00,5865,Did he find a nice Grumman.....
659541,danbouck,2012-01-23 19:29:00,4380, I think that's impossible
659548,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 19:41:00,8333,"Ya know, If someone was ambitious and lived closer to Solo an excellent practical joke could be pulled off while he's burning his berries down south."
657497,Moosebunk,2012-01-17 20:40:00,3970," Man... you're making this agonizing for me too.  Difference in price plus tax will certainly cover that cover.  You're not trailering much but instead mooring.  Dood, I can't believe this is going to be your ""at the camp"" boat.  51/49 is now 50/50..."
657499,mercman,2012-01-17 20:43:00,7054,"Mike I bought a Brand new Starfish DLX SC last April. A smaller boat, but still a Princecraft.The textured vinyl floors are quick to clean up, but do get very hot under the summer sunshine. No bare feet in the boat I had my dealer instal a color matching Bimini roof to held keep me cool. I love the stability of the reversed chine and modifed V hull, it sits relatively high in the water,and it is very responsive in turns. I have the 40HP 4 stroke, and i ran all summer, over 275hours fishing, on less than 50 dollars gas. The boat is finished very well for the price point, and i really love mine."
657501,solopaddler,2012-01-17 20:45:00,8605,  Thanks you've been a massive help HAHAHA!
657503,Harrison,2012-01-17 20:52:00,2202,"Pull the trigger Mike, before someone else finds that SmokerCraft.   For the tax savings you could probably get a mooring cover too.... just say'n.  50.5/49.5"
657516,Cudz,2012-01-17 21:52:00,2652,Is Princecraft a Canadian company?  Just another factor if that is the case.
657526,NAW,2012-01-17 22:23:00,4022,"Tough call. Both nice boats.  I like the layout of the pricecraft better personally, and the cover.  It's a close call, but I'd go Princecraft..  I've always wanted one.   Good to see you still around Cudz!"
657528,bucktail,2012-01-17 22:28:00,1857,Wider is always nicer man!
657532,fishnsled,2012-01-17 22:37:00,3520,"Well I am the happiest guy in the world right now. I just got a wicked deal on a used Smokercraft for myself and my buddy grabbed a new Princecraft. The pricing on these rides were unbelievable!!! Rumour is that some guy could make up his mind and the owner/dealer couldn't wait any longer and was motivated to move the boats.  Sorry Mike, Phil's post made me do it. So which did you buy??  BTW - I'm 50/50 and sitting on the fence with these rides as well. Certainly could easily get the cover done for the difference in price between them. Warranty is the only concern I would think at this time."
657534,danbouck,2012-01-17 22:47:00,4380,I like the smokercraft layout but you can't beat new with warranty.  I vote Princecraft
657550,Radnine,2012-01-17 23:25:00,1538,Buy a Crestliner. Jim
657551,misfish,2012-01-17 23:26:00,29133,"Mike  Been reading and following.Im a simple guy as you know.  If you are worried about coverage/warrenty, then the Prince Craft is the one. If you can cover costs of repairs of the smoker when need be,then pull the trigger. But think first.   IMO, The Prince craft is the/your best bet. Dont forget,you are not the only one using it. You dont want the rest of the family to be pissed cause you cheaped out would ya. LMAO.        Prince Craft."
657564,MuskieWannabe,2012-01-18 00:11:00,79,"My biggest pet peeve about some princecrafts, this one falling into the category...where is the rear casting deck????  Smokercraft for all the reasons listed above and the fact it has a real casting deck."
657580,John Bacon,2012-01-18 01:12:00,3277," It is located in Canada; it is American owned. They are part of Brunswick which owns Mercury outboards, Lund, Crestlines, Lowe, among other companies.   I own a 2011 Princecraft Holiday DLX SC (I think it is the same hull with a side console) and it is a soldi boat. It handles the rough water quite well but could use more storage.  By the way does the $13,500 include freight and rigging, etc.? Boats are like cars... they tack a whole lot of extra charges on to the sales price; and that is before they add the taxes. A new boat in the size range would usually have about $1,500 for freight and rigging with taxes on the total. Make sure you factor that in to your budget."
657583,solopaddler,2012-01-18 01:22:00,8605,"Thanks a bunch guys lots of good feedback!      $13,500 includes all the extra charges minus the taxes. With the stand up cover included it's a really good deal.  That said I'm leaning towards the Smokercraft. I'm going to make a decision before I leave for the land of rum and fine cigars on Saturday."
657593,John Bacon,2012-01-18 01:40:00,3277, Does that include a trailer? If so that is an incredibly good deal. I was quoted more than that for a 14.5' Resorter in 2009.
657599,solopaddler,2012-01-18 01:55:00,8605," Yep it includes a trailer, I know it's a good deal.  Thing is the Smokercraft is a 2010 ,is virtually brand new and is a couple grand cheaper.  What I found really surprising there were no real deals to be had Stateside for this class of boat.  I figured for sure I'd find my boat in the U.S. but that hasn't been the case."
657608,mike rousseau,2012-01-18 02:08:00,4661,  The deals in the states usually apply to higher end boats...  Lots of 18 foot plus boats with big motors for cheap...  These 2 boats are more entry level as far as new boats are concerned...
657624,fish_fishburn,2012-01-18 02:52:00,1311,"Tough decision Mike, I would go for the Smoker myself. Like Bob said the family is growing, get the bigger boat, and you won't have to do this again in five yrs. The Smoker is a much dryer ride as well. If your going to moor it get a good custom cover made for it, don't cheap out there. Way more boat then the Prince. I vote Smokercraft. Fish."
657667,Billy Bob,2012-01-18 11:45:00,5865," Wait a NY minute here.....you don't want to rush into anything here....it's mid winter...you have lots of time....so here's what you got to do....since I drink rum and love fine cigars and I'm not too far from you....I will bring the rum as I can get it far cheaper....while you can get the FINE Cigars (Cubans) and we will have a pow wow over this.....then after we are all liquored up we'll talk about this Smokercraft that your going to buy....we will then make a offer he can't refuse... ....Redneck style...  Seriously, if the price is 12.5k for the Smokercraft.......then 12k will EASILY get it in mid winter in this LOUSY economy.  Either way here's what BOAT translates out to:  Brake Out Another Thousand  OR  A hole in the water you keep pouring money into....."
657710,BillM,2012-01-18 15:15:00,17367,"Bob, you'd wait it out for a lousy $500 and possibly miss out on the boat?   Being cheap is good under the right circumstances, but this isn't one of them..  Mike, pick one, buy it and we'll toast a few adults pops in it this year   (Tied up to the dock of course, lol!)"
657730,solopaddler,2012-01-18 16:15:00,8605," You got it man. We'll have to get Frank up there again too. I'd suggest Ferg as well, but, well, you know..  "
657732,BillM,2012-01-18 16:31:00,17367,"Frank would love to get back up there bud, he loved those eater walleyes we got"
657846,rhare,2012-01-18 21:22:00,387,Princecraft!! Since your not going Lund...
657848,HTHM,2012-01-18 21:30:00,4082,Tiller!   Either one sounds great Mike. Just let us know where to find the other deal after you make up your mind. Good luck with the choice!
657872,Billy Bob,2012-01-18 22:31:00,5865,ALL GOOD FISHERMEN HAVE GRUMMANS....   Did I say that out loud......LOL
657373,solopaddler,2012-01-17 14:44:00,8605,"Hey guys I've narrowed my boat search down to two. Bear in mind this boat will be used solely at our camp in QC so my needs may not be the same as most.  First boat is a 2010 Smokercraft Ultima 162 with a 75 4 stroke Merc. It has the flip up seats in the back which imo is a better use of space in this class of boat. It doesn't come with a stand up cover which is needed.  http://www.boattest.com/boats/boat_video.aspx?id=2016  Second is a brand new 2011 Princecraft Holiday DLX WS with a 60hp 4 stroke Merc and a matching Princecraft cover.  http://www.princecraft.com/aluminum-boat/products/Fishing-Boats/2012/DLX-Series/Holiday-DLX-WS/specifications.aspx   I believe the Smokercraft is a more functional design, however the Princecraft is a ""slightly"" smaller boat (same length, 4"" narrower) and I think may be better on gas.  The Smokercraft is a used package from a private individual and is more or less mint. The Princecraft is brand new from a dealer.  I negotiated an amazing price on the Princecraft, it's not much more than the Smokercraft so that's not really a criteria.  Thoughts?"
657376,corvette1,2012-01-17 14:58:00,1765,the princecraft would carry a full warranty on boat and motor
657379,bigbuck,2012-01-17 15:05:00,2449,"YOU have the full warranty on the Princecraft, it has the full top which you need (how much will one cost for the Smokercraft?). The Smoker is a bit bigger with a bigger motor which is always nice but does not have what you need and canvas tops can get very expensive. Good luck and don't agonize too much, look at what fits your needs better and go with that, you won't regret either."
657382,mike rousseau,2012-01-17 15:07:00,4661,the 16 foot princecraft would be cheaper on gas... and the 60 should be plenty of power... my buddy has a 16 foot lund that is pretty wide and deep and his 60 four stroke is perfect... my 16 foot lund tiller has a 40 four stroke and it is a sweet combo...  i think that 75 would just cost you more in gas.... and your purchase isnt as protected as new with warranties...  as long as it will be 2 in the boat most of the time.... and the water being fished isnt too big... go with the princecraft...  if you want a boat that will be better for trips and having more then 2 in the boat... go with the smokercraft...
657383,blaque,2012-01-17 15:08:00,2419,"I admire that your being so diligent with your purchase lol. I'd probably jump the gun if i were in your shoes from the excitement.  I agree with your comments about the back flip seats in the smokercraft, especially with the family. Although your little ones will probbaly spend 99% of the time up front in the bow. I know ive never seen a kid get on my boat without running right for the open bow lol  I also think that black princecraft is a BAD  lookin boat. Again.....i may let my superficial side get the best of me and go for the sexier ride    You may be able to somehow mount more rear seats in the back if you ever needed them  Good Luck.....very exciting"
657384,Roy,2012-01-17 15:08:00,13728,"With the pictured layouts, you'll have more room in the Princecraft in spite of the narrower beam. I believe you'll also have less upkeep on the Princecraft. It's also a bonus if you don't have carpet."
657385,fishnsled,2012-01-17 15:10:00,3520,"I like the layout of the Smokercraft myself. I'd look into whether or not the warranty is transferable. If not, I'd be buying the Princecraft. A full stand up cover for the Smokercraft might set you back $1500-2000 I'm guessing since a travel cover without the support poles can run you about a $1000.  Yea, I might just but the Princecraft."
657388,adempsey,2012-01-17 15:23:00,1498,"Looks to me like the fisherman in you likes the versatility of the Smokercraft (more ""fishing"" features), but your practical side is telling you to go with the Princecraft (new, warranty, cover, fuel efficiency)!  Personally, I like the Smokercraft features and layout much better.  I think you can't decide because they aren't the exact boat you want.  Maybe just wait until you can get all the features you want and not simply settle - all the nice features of the Smokercraft with the practicality of the Princecraft.  Anyway, I wish this is was something I had to agonize over, lol!"
657391,solopaddler,2012-01-17 15:42:00,8605,"Thanks for the input guys. You're not making the decision any easier LOL!     I don't know Roy, I was in both and the Smokercraft had way more room.  I would need two more pedestals for the Princecraft and when they're all in place you don't have much room to manoever.  Beyond the flip up seats at the back of the Smokercraft it also has the bow pedestal in a small indent surrounded by removable padded seating. The Princecraft just has a flush carpeted platform.  That said I really like the idea of full warranty and a rig that's better on gas with the Princecraft."
657397,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-17 15:55:00,10439,"Mike I really like the Smokercraft myself. It looks infinately more fishable and has better seating to boot!!! The only thing missing is the standup top. Drop into your local marina and see what one would cost. The guys at Pt. Credit marina (can't remember the name) do good work. Cost for a full custom travel cover for my 18 footer was $600 back 10 years or so ago. I would guess that a full top including bows would be $1500-$2000. I think the Smokercraft is a better looking boat too. Gas mileage difference between the two should not be excessive, especially if you keep it in the sweet spot when running and don't run WOT all over the place.  I run my boat just under 4,000 rpm and get pretty decent mileage considering I have a 20 year old 90 on the back. But when I go over that 4,000 rpm barrier I can hear the difference in the motor and you can actually watch the gas needle move!!!  Can't wait to drop a 4 stroke on the back and watch my gas mileage double."
657401,Big Cliff,2012-01-17 16:00:00,6899,"I bought a Princecraft 164 WS two years ago and love it.  Same width, a bit longer (4"") but about 25% heaver. It does have the flip up seats, and room for the front pedistal if you want it. I have a 60 Merc on mine and it will get up and cruse at about 34 mph with no problems. As far as being good on gas, I thought my gas gauge was broken when I first got it, I just kept going and going and the gas gauge hardly moved. I finally went in to fill it up because I thought it must be close to empty, took $20.00 to fill it.  Now, if I was buying another new one I might go for the bigger engine, If I have 4 adults in mine with our gear and everyone behind the windshield, it can be a little slow to get up on plane with only the 60. For everyday use and for my needs, the 60 is perfect and super quiet!  Personally, I'd go with the Princecraft.  Whatever you decide you are going to end up going "" well if I was to do it again"" LOL."
657412,solopaddler,2012-01-17 16:14:00,8605,Thanks Cliff that helps.
657417,Stef,2012-01-17 16:18:00,63,"A 75 Merc is a larger block size than a 60 and weighs a lot more but the added width of the boat makes carrying it level better.  Some things I would check are location of gas tank, weight of fuel affects the balance, like one running up the centre or near front better than across the back.  Aluminum thickness, PrinceCraft may be built as a price leader.  Quality of trailer, even if used just for storage.  You may get some ""extras"" with the used boat ie; sonar, extra prop, anchor, bumpers, etc.  New boat ""bugs"" have been worked out already on the old boat, is the PrinceCraft dealer close if you have to haul out and make the trip.  Is there similar instrumentation and I assume both have power trim/tilt.  Lots of fun..."
657421,Billy Bob,2012-01-17 16:26:00,5865,NEVER once did I hear someone say I wish I had a smaller outboard on my boat....but MANY times I have heard I wish I had more horse power sometimes.....with a growing family get the bigger rig.
657426,Harrison,2012-01-17 16:31:00,2202,"Mike, I just striclty looked at the boat layouts and power with no idea about price or the extras involved.  Based on the above, I'd go with the Smokercraft."
657451,hirk,2012-01-17 17:57:00,571,"Look at how each is rigged, tm's & electronics,safety equipment etc. The smoker is likely sructurally stronger due to the hp rating and extra dry weight. The 75 being the bigger block would have more ummpf and would perform much better when you load the boat down and for tubing/skiing.Difference in gas usage would be coffee money so dont even give that a second thought,load both down and your mpg would be about even. If it was me Id lean to the smoker."
657454,Pigeontroller,2012-01-17 18:17:00,2793,"If your on a small lake the 60 hp seems more practical. Not sure how big your lake is Mike.  I will never buy a Pricecraft. A friend had one, full windshield. The Windshield glass is tempered, and the wrapped stuff is expensive. Tempered glass is very strong except the edges...which cannot tolerate much contact with metal or anything hard...The windshield on this boat shattered 5 times!!! Princecraft paid for it twice then basically said FU. I knew all along what the problem was (I'm in the glass business) There was a rivet that was touching the edge of the glass..."
657462,Moosebunk,2012-01-17 18:44:00,3970,"WICKED Mike!!!  Either, or, man, tough call.  Guys here are making some awesome points in favor of their choices too.  I think you'd be hard pressed to go wrong either way, they both look awesome.  I think if I had to give one boat my 51% as a the go ahead for a multi-use fishing boat first... Probably the Princecraft.  Gas mileage... probably not much of an issue, but you do fish alot, and travel alot to fish... pulling or pushing more weight adds up.  Give the edge to the lighter Princecraft... slightly.  Warranty... edge to the Princecraft.  Cover... edge to the Princecraft.  Resale... edge slightly to the Princecraft.  I can tell ya too bud.  The 16' 3"" Rebel XL I have, (although a tiller) is 775 dry and about the same weight as that Princecraft, has a Yammy 60HP to push it to a max 35mph, has the same 84"" beam... and gets me in and out of all the same places that bigger Smokercraft would go.  The motor sips fuel to push that boat.  Did I say yet that the black is wicked... edge... Princecraft... looks and personal preference.  Again though... only 51/49 in favor of the Princecraft... that Smoker is smoking too, and it looks like a bit more comfortable a family/fishing boat with that extra bit of power too.  Agonize away... Gonna be a tough year for you with the boat, Eddies, Sutton... geez... lol."
657466,rob v,2012-01-17 19:03:00,535,buy'em both !!  sounds like you could mull this for quite a while. both units sound like great choices.  but like a few here have said - the bigger motor is always nice to have in reserve !!  As kids get older things like tubing and skiing start to sound like a lot of fun and the extra hp might help then !! and I'm not sure how much gas you'd save with the smaller unit
657469,solopaddler,2012-01-17 19:12:00,8605," Won't be travelling with this boat, it'll be moored at the camp, so trailerability (is that a word?) is a non factor.   The other boat I looked at and seriously considered was a 2010 Lund Rebel 1625 XL Sport with a 50 Merc 4 stroke. I really liked it a lot. It also had a full cover, trolling motor, electronics, and the flip up rear seats. The bottom line on that one was 17 g's all in.   In actuality there is a bit of a price difference between the Smokercraft and the Princecraft.  Princecraft (bear in mind this is brand new from a dealer) is $13,500 plus tax.  Smokercraft I think I can get for $12500 all in."
657470,fishindevil,2012-01-17 19:21:00,6254,well i would think the princecraft mike because of the warranty ...good luck they are both great boats
657472,Grimace,2012-01-17 19:24:00,2020,That smoker looks like a really comfortable family boat.  They are both great looking boats.  I would give the edge to the Smoker.  Either way you're going to be a very happy man.  Congrats.
657476,Nemo,2012-01-17 19:41:00,727,Where will this boat spend the winter? Will you have to trailer it home or will you store it at the camp?
657478,solopaddler,2012-01-17 19:44:00,8605," Indoor storage in Cambridge, so yeah it'll be trailered back and forth in the spring and fall.  It's only twice a year though so not a factor."
657494,michigander fisherman,2012-01-17 20:19:00,64,think about what you really want the boat for. even though the princecraft is brand new if you feel that the smokercraft has a better layout for fishing then get that because thats what youre getting the boat for is fishing. 4 stroke are great on gas anyway so i bet there wont be much of a different
