I took the plunge and ordered 4 sets of replacement bearings for 2 Citicas and 2 Accurist PTs. What a difference!  With the stock bearings both reals will free spool for about 8 seconds. After the bearing upgrade, they go for over a minute. I can really notice the difference flippin, haven’t tried casting…not allowed to do that in the house! The upgrade definitely lived up to the claims…highly recommend. ( and no I don’t work for Boca)"
659063,BillM,2012-01-22 14:39:00,17367,Very cool!  What did the upgrade cost for the Citica?
659087,kickingfrog,2012-01-22 16:22:00,8333,I'm the same as you. Where did you order the bearings? And was it easy to change them? I want to upgrade my Curado300 bearings and don't want to have $300 worth of parts if I screw up.
659095,Roy,2012-01-22 16:44:00,13728,I think he bought Abec bearings from Boca?

659173,buckhorn250,2012-01-22 20:58:00,85,"Yes, bought the Orange ceramic bearings from Boca. It worked out to about $30 per real. Very easy to swap out...takes less then five minutes and you can find several videos demonstrating how on youtube.  C"
659228,biggs,2012-01-23 00:08:00,21,"I also replace all the spool bearings in my reels.  Shimano's are very easy to replace but Daiwa's can be a little more tricky because of the bearing on the spool and popping that pin out can be difficult.  You can get the bearing from Boca Bearings, shipping is free! You can also get 25% off for the next two months or so by using this code : 25DISCOUNT2012"
659241,biggs,2012-01-23 00:40:00,21,forgot to mention another nice little upgrade is replacing bushings in the handles with bearings if your reel allows that.
