657965,BillM,2012-01-19 03:14:00,17367,You'll be looking long and hard to find another whitefish factory like Simcoe within 2hrs of Alliston.  She'll be locked up soon enough.

658036,Woodsman,2012-01-19 13:25:00,1286,I'm going to try out Boshkung Lake. I'll post how I do.
658047,johnnyb,2012-01-19 13:51:00,3413,I've heard that Restoule is pretty good for the whities....might be out of your 2 hour range....but not by much
658160,jimmer,2012-01-19 18:37:00,2730,When are you going to Boshkung? I heard it's not safe yet.
658164,Woodsman,2012-01-19 18:46:00,1286,This weekend. Just talked to the motel. Good to go at their location.
658169,Billy Bob,2012-01-19 19:07:00,5865,Have you tried Big Caribou Lake.....
658176,Oggie,2012-01-19 19:41:00,588,We used to catch whitefish in the harbours at Meaford and Owen Sound. I know Owen Sound is open but I wonder if Meaford is fishable.  Collingwood??? Dan O.

658353,J-M,2012-01-20 02:46:00,65," I heard Clear Lake just north of Lake Joseph has whities, never tried myself but worth looking into.."
658389,bigredfisher,2012-01-20 05:52:00,300,Send me a pm I'm from tottenham. Maybe we can get out .
659160,skeeter,2012-01-22 19:20:00,1907,How did you make out woodsman?
659380,Woodsman,2012-01-23 13:40:00,1286,"Fishing was pretty slow. Only fished Saturday. Marking lots of fish but few biters. Others around me report the same thing. I got one laker at 40cm. When jigging the fish would come up to look at the jig but only 2 light taps on jigs. Tried many types of jigs with the same results. The one I caught came off a minnow on the bottom & it was a very lite hit. Where I was had about 8"" of good ice."
