659418,johnnyb,2012-01-23 14:33:00,3413,"Well the weekend was getting close, and there were no plans on the calendar for us to be up North, but the wife could tell I was getting a bit antsy.  She suggested that maybe I needed a bit of ""me-time"" and that I should go do a bit of fishing on Saturday.  WOW do I ever love her  I didn't want to skip out on the family for the entire day, so I headed to a lake I've never fished that was within a couple hours of home.  Walked out to a decent spot with 35 FOW under me and jigged up my new PB crappie.  I lost another one that felt about the same, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going back when I get the chance.  Nice morning on the iceâ€¦.just what the doctor ordered.  A few pics:        "

659432,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-23 14:49:00,336,Beautiful fish there man.  The gold and silver hues pop.  Way to go on your pb.  What is the critter in pic 2?

659533,johnnyb,2012-01-23 18:52:00,3413,"Thanks guys....critter in pic #2 was a really healthy red fox. Hopped on the ice a stone's throw away from me, and sniffed around a bit, but by the time I got the phone out for a pic, he was crossing the lake at a good clip"
