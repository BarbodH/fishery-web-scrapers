MERCI!!!"

659166,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-22 19:30:00,2690," She won on biggest walleye, and most perch...I actually landed one more walleye, and, one more ling....but who's counting"
659176,vinnimon,2012-01-22 21:02:00,2593,Awesome report and pics Frank and Juli  Not only am I getting hungry but jealous aswell
659180,Mike the Pike,2012-01-22 21:17:00,3421,Excellent report.Love the ling shots.  That pink sunrise shot is a beauty!!!!!!  MTP
658309,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 01:16:00,2690,"Anybody that lives in southwestern Ontario that loves to ice fish knows how I've felt so far this winter.....WITHDRAWAL!!!!!!!!!!  Needless to say I've been itching for our annual winter getaway.  This year the destination was Lake Nipissing with hosts Shawn and Terra up at Idle Tyme.  I'm not going to make this a ""wordy"" report, would rather let the pictures tell the story.  Juli and I had a fantastic time as you can tell by the smiles on our faces.  The fishing was good, consistent enough that we didn't have too many lulls.  If it wasn't walleye biting, we were into perch.  If it wasn't perch, a herring.  Not too mention the thrill of catching our first Ling; Juli had a couple, and I landed three.  Thus the ""ugly"" in the title.  The pics  Sunday afternoon Juli's first drop of the line, a nice perch    Some ""smalleyes""     Juli's beauty walter, we didn't bother measuring to see if it was above the slot. Let her go to spawn and make more of those ""Nip"" beauties!!     Juli feasting on some perch and walleye    Monday morning sunrise    My first Nipissing herring    Juli's first ever ling coming through the hole    The fight!!     My first Ling, kept this one for our first ""freshwater lobster"" taste    Juli with a little walleye    Lowrance Lit Up    Juli with another    Tuesday, little 'eye head     My big ling    Another ""headshot""    Small ling    The snowstorm Tuesday night     Juli in the snow.  It was blowing in really strong.    Wednesday morning, our home on the ice    Juli's second Ling    Another small eye for the walleye queen    Home away from home, cozy and warm     Don't have any pics, but, we also caught many perch...these were the main course in our nightly fish dinners, along with a few walleyes.  The two of us had a great time, fishing and just getting a nice ""battery recharge"".  Felt so good to finally hit the hardwater, and, we can't wait to go back to experience ""The Nip""!!!!"

658317,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 01:25:00,2690," It's a small cottage, that also has two bedrooms and a full four piece bathroom.  Perfect for the two of us. Thanks for the comments, I was grinning going through all the pics making this report.  Forgot to add this one, Ling and melted butter..mmmmmmmmm  "

658466,Joey,2012-01-20 15:33:00,9122,Excellent report and great fish.  How did the ling taste?  Nice accomodations too
658471,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-20 15:51:00,2690," Hey, Joey!  The ling was surprisingly good.  Had heard so much about them, we had to try one.  I cut the meat into cubes, boiled for between 10-12 minutes.  Dipped in melted butter, lobster style, and enjoy. Good meat on the back, and, the tail. The skin is slimy and stinky...similiar odour to a musky, but, the meat is nice white flesh. We would both definitely eat one again."
658473,johnnyb,2012-01-20 15:53:00,3413,Awesome report!  Lots of fish and lots of smiles....just the way it should be
