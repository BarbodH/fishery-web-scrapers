659085,walleyemen,2012-01-22 16:20:00,316,"I bought a l.e.d light bar made by rampage, it will not work correctly on my 07 old body style g.mc truck, tried it on 6 other trucks ranging in years from 2000 to 2006 same results , problem is no running lights and when the left siganl is on the whole bar blinks, everyhing else works, it connect to the rear trailer plug, tried it on any truck 2007 and newer with the new body style and it works perfect, i performed all the proper checks at the plug and everything works fine, why would it work on a new truck and not mine , the plug configuration is the same?Trucks and stuff says it works for 1999 and up so i,m really confused, i even thought maybe it was the ground and tried a remote ground with the same results! anyone one had similiar problems, rampage l.e.d light bar model 960136."

659102,GYPSY400,2012-01-22 17:18:00,191,"I can't see it being a big problem.. Run a dedicated power and ground and it should work.. Also, make sure the polarity is correct with LED's"
659106,Sinker,2012-01-22 17:29:00,8692,Sounds like your truck needs a new ground to me.  S.
