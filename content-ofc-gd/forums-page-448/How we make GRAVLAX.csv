658960,Bluegill,2012-01-22 01:25:00,197,"Here is the recipe:  GRAVLAX  1 kg fresh salmon filets 3 tablespoons salt 2-3 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons crushed white pepper 1-2 bouquets fresh dill (lots)  Remove as many bones as you can (use pliers for those ones that stick up along the middle line), but leave the skin. Mix salt, sugar and pepper, and rub the pieces of salmon with it on all sides. Chop dill roughly and divide into three approximately equal amounts. Spread one third of the dill on the bottom of a dish and place a piece of salmon on top of it, skin down. Spread the next third on top of that piece, and place the other piece of salmon on it, skin up. Cover with remaining dill. Weigh down lightly with a rock or large can of whatever. Leave in the fridge for 36-48 hours. Turn every morning and night and pour off any liquid that may have formed.  The fish is ready to eat! Scrape off the spices and dill and cut thin slices along the broad surface of the filet (like shavings). You may serve it with plain toast or boiled new potatoes, and with a slice of lemon or a lovely mustard sauce.  Gravlax keeps for about a week.  Serve with: Mustard sauce (Gravlax sÃ¥s)  Mix 30 ml of sweet mustard with 30 ml sugar and 15 ml vinegar. Add 100 ml oil gradually, stirring steadily. When you have a smooth thick sauce add finely chopped fresh dill.  Pictures:              How we make CAVIAR"

658973,Rod Caster,2012-01-22 01:53:00,5784,"That looks incredible. I'm going to transcribe this recipe. Do you think it would work with perch, or walleye, or burbot?"
658975,Leecher,2012-01-22 01:58:00,7832,Here's my recipe for trout... very simple and taste great   Butter is all you need in the hot pan  Speckle Delight
658978,Bluegill,2012-01-22 02:03:00,197," Well, you can do it with every fish I guess. But always freeze it before starting the recipe! With the other fish you mentioned you won't get the nice red look. Btw, this is our favourite recipe for red fleshed trout.  With burbot we make a Finnisch fish soup - delicious!"
659003,bigugli,2012-01-22 02:53:00,6138," Nothing like a thick creamy and rich pot of kala mojakka simmering on the stove.  As for using white fleshed fish for Gravlax, you would not get the same result. They do not have anything near the oil content in the flesh."
659051,turtle,2012-01-22 13:08:00,274,I've done a similar recipie with the addition of a bit of vodka.turned what I considered somewhat mushy lake O salmon into a tasty appetizer.
659061,Terry,2012-01-22 14:38:00,14456,"I think it might be time to put together the OFC/OFC/OFC (whichever it is) Cookbook I sure have seen a lot of great looking recipes here.......  or...(I hate to say it, because I have always thought too many sections makes it hard to find everything) a new section for all the great meals people are cooking a recipe section could be cool..."
659065,Bluegill,2012-01-22 14:41:00,197," Good idea! For those who have sharp eyes to see the the black spots on the shown filets, they are crushed juniper berries. As you know, juniper berries is the stuff gin is made with!"
659066,Bluegill,2012-01-22 14:44:00,197,"I got a message with this question:  > When you say ""freeze"" the fish first.... what's your method of freezing the > meat for this recipe? How long does it need to be frozen for? > I will usually place the fillets in water, but that's because they stay in my > freezer for a couple weeks.  Answer: I cut the filets and and wrap them in foil. Put them in the freezer for 1 day or whenever you would like to use them. It is just a precaution in case there were parasites - I have never seen any in the trout we caught. Enjoy, it's the best recipe for red trout!"
659072,lhousesoccer,2012-01-22 15:31:00,442,Gravlax is one of my and my wife's favourite way to eat salmon.  The 3 days we let it sit and cure in the fridge is almost unbearable as we can't wait to slice that baby up and eat it!  Here's our recipe!! Gravlax.doc

659129,manitoubass2,2012-01-22 18:26:00,11391,My goodness that looks delicious!  I too would like to see a dedicated recipe book/thread for OFC recipes

659343,wormdunker,2012-01-23 10:06:00,1711,What is the purpose of the dill?
659353,turtle,2012-01-23 11:35:00,274,"The dill is for flavour, you can use others.  It's the salt that cures the fish."
659355,Roy,2012-01-23 11:58:00,13728," Our sister site put up a recipe page many moons ago because everyone seemed to want that. Not that many contributors...there is a Gravlax recipe there though.  Go to the link, read and try some of those recipes and knock yourself out posting your own! http://www.ontariofishing.net/fish-recipes/"

659597,EC1,2012-01-23 22:31:00,930,That looks really good! I'll definitely look forward to trying this new recipe soon!  Are there any fish that can replace the salmon? Lakers? Splake? Rainbows?
