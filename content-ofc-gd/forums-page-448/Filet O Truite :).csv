658880,12footspringbok,2012-01-21 22:33:00,459, Why on earth would you want to ruin the sweet taste of brook trout with that?   Leechman I'll trade you some perch fillets for some of those brook trout bodies if you want fillets that bad...LOL
658882,Rod Caster,2012-01-21 22:37:00,5784,"  Haha. I just bought a new knife, so I'm having filleting withdrawls as well. It's been over a week since i've caught a fish!!"

Man you know how to make a guy hungry."
