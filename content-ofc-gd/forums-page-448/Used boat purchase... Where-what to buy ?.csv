He has roghly $14000 to spend.  He is looking for ... -Aluminum -approx 18 ft - 90+ HP - All the toys... FF, Trolling motor, etc.  It will be used for bass, walleye, muskie, and perch..... fishing Rondeau, Mitchells bay, erieau area.  I have suggested to him that he should go state side if he is looking to pay cash.  Would you be able to find a later model lund for that price range ????"
