Well worth to buy a bottle of bubbly to go with it.  Our recipe:  1. Use only fresh eggs  2. Gently remove individual eggs from the skein and place them in a bowl. You will probably get about 1-1/2 cups of eggs from a Â½-pound skein. As you pick out the eggs, remove and discard pieces of membrane, blood, and bits of intestine or black skin.      3. For each 1 or 2 cups of cleaned eggs, add 1/2-cup salt to 2 cups cold water in a large bowl and stir until salt is dissolved.  4. Pour eggs into brine. Swirl eggs and let stand 30 minutes to firm and absorb salt. Remove any membrane pieces found.  5. Pour caviar into a strainer. Rinse in cold water, and drain. Pick out remaining membrane.  6. Store caviar in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator. Caviar can be kept several weeks, or as long as the flavor is pleasant.  You can serve it like this Rainbow Caviar, cracker with cream cheese and...      Enjoy!  How we make GRAVLAX from trout"
