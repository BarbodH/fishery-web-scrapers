654259,flyingfish,2012-01-07 04:22:00,4,if your hearts set on aluminum look at lund and princecraft ive been nothing but happy from both these boats id also recommend taking a hard look at the 18 and 17ft lund pro v models and playing with the boatbuilder on lund you can easily price out a boat there also ive owned a lund sendero 16.5 and now i own a princecraft pro 165 both amazing boats both can handle big water ive fished lake ontario in both these boats and a lund explroer in 4ft rollers with no problems goodluck in your choice! my next boat is either the princecraft pro 195 with a 200 yammy or a lund pro v  1975/2075 with a 150-225 yammy  yammy
654284,Spouph,2012-01-07 12:36:00,115,"  Huron is probally like ontario deep water with big rollers, you can absolutly fish a 20 k wind you just run the trough, somtimes its hard getting into port but it is possible.  My friends lund is just awesome for huron,  he gets out as much as I do.  Erie comes up quick and the waves are tighter together,  it a chop and when your close to shore, that has the bathtup effect  waves hit from every direction.  Not to mention the current out in the center during certain times of the year, because it is soo shallow they current does wonky things to the waves as well.   Borrow before you buy.   good luck"
654309,fishdawg,2012-01-07 14:57:00,912,"You have a few advantages right now in your favor; a good budget, time is on your side and its a buyers market now.  Alumnacraft or Crestliner get my votes, I bought my Cresty at Proctor Marine in Simcoe (Hwy #3)and they are a very good dealer.  Definetly get a kicker and try for Yamaha or Suzuki 4-strokes for your outboards.  Dont skimp on an electric motor or your electronics either. Digital DSC VHF Radio w/ 8' antenna  and new generation sonar/gps.  A Galvanized trailer with LEDs will be the last trailer you'll ever own too  good luck with your search & purchase"

It's been great, and compared to a 17 footer has a ton more space, which is nice on a cool day when you have 3 or 4 people in the boat with equipment and dressed in survival suits.  Has been great on the big water and equally nice on the tiny inland lakes.  I had a 16' prior and the move to a 20 was the best thing I have done.  Once you sit in a 20 and drive it a couple times you'll be glad you did."

At this point the boats are about 80% complete. The remaining assembly of the boats are done and shipped all over Canada. We have 48 Dealers across Canada. A lot of people are under the assumption that we are a smokercraft,sylvan or starcraft product and that is 100% false. If you look at their product, a riveted product they are totally different boats from the construction to the layouts of ours. Smokercraft has an excellent reputation and superior quality so why not have them build our hulls to that standard."

653787,sneak_e_pete,2012-01-06 01:02:00,540,Thanks for all of the feedback.  Any feedback on Legend boats?
653788,Dutch,2012-01-06 01:04:00,831,"If you are looking for a family boat, you may want to consider a glass boat over aluminum.  The ride is considerably better IMO.  I too would reccomend staying away from Tracker boats, although I don't think they are as bad as they are made out to be.  I truly believe the result of much of the cracked welds are due to power loading the boat on a trailer, which is specifically advised against by the manufacturer.  Those boats are not meant to be power loaded on a trailer."
653800,captpierre,2012-01-06 01:18:00,2521,"If you live in Grimsby, you'll likley be fishing Lake O and Erie. Make sure the boats a deep V hull and at least 17 ft.  The bigger the better IMO. Think about a kicker for fuel savings and safety.  Unless of course you by a Yammy main engine.  No safety kicker required there I own a Lund/ Yammy.  Was nervous to buy welded but ran across a CO on Nipissing a few years back with a 10 yr old 19 ft welded Crestliner/Yammy.  He said they beat the snot out of it on big water and no problems with leaks."
653801,Spouph,2012-01-06 01:22:00,115,"  For what it is worth, I have to laugh at my self, I remember saying those exact same words, I previously owned, a 16 sylvan with a 40 four stroke all set up for fishing.  I just loved that boat.  However, I bought a older 21 ft sylvyn sport cruiser next for the family(sold the first boat).  So I told myself....That boat was to big for doing the small lakes, so then bought a used tiller 25 hp with 16 foot aluminum no bells and whistles.  Kept the 21 footer.  So the problem lies now I have 2 boats for fishing with my family, and a family that doesn't like to fish as much as I do.  I wish I had my first boat back.  Advice, look at your family and your own needs, find out if is what they want, borrow a buddies boat and try it out before you buy it.  I just bought a house an a lake.  My next purchas is a pontoon boat.  That is my suggestion to you.  Under 30gs you can get a hell of a spacious\family\fishing boat,  Out of a pontoon boat but you have to sacrifice some of the fishing.  But what do I know I have been wrong before and will be wrong again.  Good luck with your purchas.  I have owened johnston, yahama, mercruser, merc, and  Honda boat motors.  Honda was by far the best in my opinion.  The cost of fuel between the 40 and the 115 will be noticable."
653806,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 01:31:00,4661,I have a friend that is thinking about stepping do from an 18 foot alumacraft console... To a 16 foot tiller...  Better boat control... Cheap on fuel... Easy to tow...  I agree with spouph  Unless your gunna hit the great lakes and simcoe... Then the size is nice
653830,Spouph,2012-01-06 02:11:00,115," I forgot to mention, if you are going after the great lakes, like Erie and Huron  I have spent counless hours 30 to 40 plus days per summer for the last 7 years.  5 to 14 hour trips.  If you are doing the big water.  Look at fiberglass, with a kicker.  Smoother ride,   and the kicker  to get you in if the big motor fails.  It happens on all boats new and old.  My first year in fuel was over 2500, with no kicker on account of the hevier boat, after the kicker you can cut the cost to around a 1000, over 4 years the motor pays for itself, not to mention the speed control a kicker gives you.  And deep water trolling that can be the difference on a windy day trust me.  I've seen buddies fish beside me with no kicker, same lures etc.  they get skunked, me rarely.  I've docked mine not towed around 1000 per season.  Picked my boat up for 10 g put mabey 10 into it with kicker). It has been reliable.  there are litterly thousand of good cheap used boats for sale. Erie is the scariest water I have ever been on, that includes the Pacific ocean(which i lived on for 2 years).  Waves come from all directions and it comes up quick.  Don't dick around with that lake."
653831,BillM,2012-01-06 02:12:00,17367, Just sold our 15' Legend tiller and replaced it with a Lund Pro Sport.  I've got nothing but good things to say about the Legend.  I put that boat through it's paces on water I never should have been on and it handled it without a problem.  The only thing I can say is buy the biggest motor the boat can handle.  We had a 40hp 4-stroke Honda on the back of ours and it got me out of some sketchy situations....
653835,Sinker,2012-01-06 02:17:00,8692,"Don't forget about starcraft. Great, solid, no worries, hulls. They have been around for a long time, too.  The one I have now is staying with me for life. Sure, I'll upgrade to a bigger boat sooner or later, but for now, mine does everything I ask of it, and then some. I was just out on lake O today in it, beleive it or not!  Its a '93, 16ft wide body tiller, with a 40 mariner,  and is in the water from late march, till now, every year. I beat the hell out of it, carry way too much gear in it, abuse it, let it freeze, fill it with crap and dirt....no problem. It still doesn't leak a drop!!  I would buy another starcraft no question!  S."
653836,Pigeontroller,2012-01-06 02:18:00,2793,"Go check out the Alumacrafts at Bay City Marine(Hestor St, Upper Hamilton) Alumacrafts are priced well, and you can put any motor on it you like. Tell Doug and Clarence Dax sent you, they are a little dry at first, but are great guys and will treat you well."
653906,landry,2012-01-06 05:20:00,1005,"I truly believe the result of much of the cracked welds are due to power loading the boat on a trailer, which is specifically advised against by the manufacturer.  Those boats are not meant to be power loaded on a trailer.   That is Bull (on Tracker's behalf, not yours) - power loading a boat if done properly, puts no additional stress on the hull - you don't ram it on the trailer, u snuggle it up and then give it enough gas to push it into place - FAR less force on the hull than hitting waves and equivalent to the force needed to move it the same distance with the winch. A lot of people are suggesting he avoid Tracker and I think that is very good advice. Lund has a transferable lifetime warranty and that is what I would buy if money was no issue. I have owned two Crestliner Fish Hawks and love them. The nicest aluminums I have ever seen are the Lund Predator - WOW, followed by the Pro-V. Landry   "
653907,landry,2012-01-06 05:22:00,1005, Pigeontroller is dead on about Bay City - they are true professionals and they carry alumacrafts and Yammies.
653908,John Bacon,2012-01-06 05:38:00,3277," Agreed, if power loading was the issue then all brands should have problems with cracked hulls. Tracker seems to be only brand where cracked hulls are a common problem. Are Tracker owners the only ones who power load?"
653917,GYPSY400,2012-01-06 09:37:00,191," I own a legend too, so far so good.. but it's considerably smaller than what your looking for.. (16 prosport tiller w/30hp merc 2 Stroke).. The reason I went with the legend is the .100 guage hull ( thickest in the industry aside from G3) and the dealer was close to me.. They are also one of the few manufactures that show you how the boat is made from the inside out. They are made in the smokercraft plant, but to Legend spec.. ( smokers don't have .100 hull).. And their bigger boats seem pretty nice too.. Some models like the 16 or 18 Xcaliber models can convert from a fishing boat to a family boat in a matter of minutes.   I'd say, don't rule them out while shopping as their reputation has improved in recent years. Just be prepared to upgrade the engine as the base package price comes with a motor barely fit for the boat, and watch the price of the options ( i.e. the price of trolling motors, fish finders and extra seats)  http://legendboats.com/en/view/boat/2011_18_xcalibur"

Also be careful of the pitch on the motor...makes a big difference.  Get a full windshield -- very good on cold days making long runs.  Mine has a Bimini top, full cover, etc -- all came with the boat.  I paid $16k in 2005, its a 2003.  Came with riggers, etc.  It's been excellent for me, especially on Simcoe and other bigger lakes -- nice deep V so the ride is dry.  You should be able to get an excellent boat a year or two old in the early $20's I think.  For $30k you can get EXACTLY what you want.  As always, overall performance will have as much to do with your maintenance and treatment as it will with the initial brand name...many make an excellent boat.  Happy Shopping."

If you're looking for a big water boat I would recommend you look at closely a Starcraft Superfisherman. A highly underrated big water riveted aluminum boat that is not nearly as overpriced as some. If you are looking at primarily an inland lake boat I'd look at an Alumacraft Trophy or something in the Lund family of boats. Put my buddies Alumacraft Trophy Sport beside my Pro-V and they are almost identical. The Alumacrafts offer great fit and finish, quality seats (better than mine), and lots of storage (same as mine and mine's a 19). My only advantage is my ride is superior in rougher water. With your family you need at least an 18' boat, especially if you go with a full windshield."

He can't get out half the time I can, some times you have to run 8 to 15 km to get to where the fish are they move miles in a week, at least they did this season last not so much.  Iam talking 15 k winds which are the best for eye's no lie 30(50 to 70 including bows and sheep head) plus days in 5 to 8 hours of fishing.  His boat could not handle that.  He ended up in my boat most of the season.  He is buying a 24 ft searay.  If you arnet equipprd to fish a 3 ft chop, you will be off the water most days by lunch, if you even get out at all.

Deals abound down there. A 17.5ft'r with a 115 or even better, a 150 would be great. Max out your HP, you will never regret that you did, and your boat will end up with a higher resale. Once you have a few people on board and are trying to do some tubing or skiing, the bigger motor will shine."

Others can be a viable compromise in good weather on the great lakes. Always have enough horsepower to make a speedy retreat to safe harbor.  Crestliner, Lund, Almacraft make decent boats, I personally wouldn`t own a tracker, just too many friends that had issues with them. No idea on the Canadian models."
653596,bassassin,2012-01-05 16:13:00,152,"Tracker offers a lifetime warranty on all thier welds or 5 years whatever comes first!!!!Believe me we got burned on that one! Just ask Hookerdown. we are currently taking the floor out of a $25,000 boat that is 5.5 years old and the only way they would fix the centre beam weld running from the bow straight back to the transom is if we brought the boat to Missouri which is a hell of a trek from Mississauga. Stick with a trusted brand with longevity like a Lund or Princecraft. Stay away from Tracker. Did I mention the boat was 25K and we are currently taking the floors and floatation material out of it to fix the welds from the inside cause tracker wont help us out cause the warranty is a whopping 5 months out of the 5 year expiry date!  No were not too bitter!!!!"

653612,lew,2012-01-05 16:46:00,12766,There's been a few reports lately where Canucks have bought boats & motors in the States but then have had problems with warranties on the motors up here.  Just something to check into if your bringing a motor across the border.
