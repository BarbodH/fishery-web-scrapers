With the HORRIBLE weather we have been having here in SWO, we are looking to travel north in search of some fish/ICE !  We are thinking a weekender to Simcoe is in line.  What are some places you would suggest for a trip like this. We live in Chatham-Kent and are willing to drive 5-6 hours north... maybe more if its worth it.  Any suggestions for a clean, ""affordable"" trip ? Looking to get into some jumbos or some nice pike.  Thanks"
