It was a cold but there was not much wind which was nice, as we don't have a hut. Our plan was to use minnows to catch the Perch but it turned out that we stopped using the minnows because the fish were so aggressive. Instead, we both switched to using a speacial lure tipped with nothing and we hammered the Perch all day long. We fished in about 25 feet of water and found that a lot of the jumbos that we caught were suspended about 8 - 12 feet off the bottom. We didn't have to move much all day because the bit was constant. Here is a pic of a few of the Perch that we caught.  "
