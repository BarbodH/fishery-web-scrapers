659227,manitoubass2,2012-01-23 00:08:00,11391,"Any chance you took a measurement of the fish?  Man those are nice gators your posting up, but they appear short and very fat.  Beautiful fish man, good friggin' job!"
659232,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 00:18:00,8333," Usually a sign of a very healthy fish and fishery.  The fish that have big heads, compared to body size, are often unhealthy, have gone through or are going through a rough season(s), or are from a fishery that does not have enough food for them."
659235,Fishing 24/7,2012-01-23 00:29:00,709,  Your right on the money with this.   while i wait for my rods to fire off. i jig these perch by the dozen with micro jigs to pass the time.      And here is onther pike i landed today!        Pure sing of  HEALTH!

659288,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 02:10:00,2449,  Nice pike(s) for sure.   I think he means Megatron from Transformers?
659290,skeeter,2012-01-23 02:14:00,1907,Awesome!!!! Love the color in the tail too.  :thumbsup_anim:
659291,tapout,2012-01-23 02:20:00,166,I think he meant a  megaladon.  http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/otherprehistoriclife/a/megalodon-facts.htm
659292,Pigeontroller,2012-01-23 02:22:00,2793,Maybe you meant real live 'Sarcosuchus' or  real live 'Carcharodon megalodon'   Great report as usual!!!
