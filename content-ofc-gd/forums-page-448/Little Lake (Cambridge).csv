658770,luclarochelle,2012-01-21 15:32:00,37,"Just wondering if anyone has been out on Little lake this year? Im looking if its good this year or if its slow. Also, im just wondering about the ice report if its safe or not? Im going out tomorrow and just wanted some ice/ fish report...  Thanks Luc"
658779,uglyfish,2012-01-21 16:29:00,981,its been fishable for about 2 weeks now. should be at least 6-8 inches of ice now after these recent temps. pike being caught there.
658780,luclarochelle,2012-01-21 16:38:00,37, Okay thank you. Do you know if the crappie are hitting at all? or any panfish?
658792,ch312,2012-01-21 17:23:00,1590,"considering how small the lake actually is and the increased pressure due to the big lake access being closed off, i think it's in the best interest of the lake to keep it on the d-low. that said, the internet has already resulted in the lake practically being fished out...."
658806,luclarochelle,2012-01-21 18:39:00,37, True say...  im going there Sunday hopefully its good
658885,ch312,2012-01-21 22:40:00,1590, good luck.

659164,luclarochelle,2012-01-22 19:23:00,37," Just got back in, ice is good its around 5 and a half inches. Their was lots of people out today. We got 11 perch and 1 pike. We lost 2 pike"
659181,danbouck,2012-01-22 21:18:00,4380,"Enjoy it now, there will be no fish left in it by the spring"
659193,luclarochelle,2012-01-22 22:40:00,37,  People just need to C&R...
659264,Musky or Specks,2012-01-23 01:25:00,2710,I agree Dan Something needs to be done locally to increase ice fishing opportunities or some of these small lakes are going to get creamed.
