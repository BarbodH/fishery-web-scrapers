659446,BucktownAngler,2012-01-23 15:13:00,582,"i have a heavy rod set up for pike and was using some power pro on it this weekend, and it froze up and got stiff.  hard to reel in etc.  what line do you guys use for pike through the ice?"
659448,Roy,2012-01-23 15:16:00,13728,You can use 30lb mono but I'd go the heavy dacron. The black line.
659460,BillM,2012-01-23 15:31:00,17367,Mono would probably be my choice.
659472,Raf,2012-01-23 15:50:00,3495,"dacron works on the tip ups  for the jig sticks, 14-17 trilene xt with a wire leader."
659484,BucktownAngler,2012-01-23 16:12:00,582,ill be using a heavy rod in a rod holder outside the hut
659487,Harrison,2012-01-23 16:16:00,2202,I've gotten some great feedback on the Tuf-line Duracast because the coating it does not hold water.  I've found that to be accurate with the lighter test but have not used the heavier LB myself.
659520,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-23 17:46:00,10439,I use 20# Power Pro and deal with the freeze up issues. Might have to try some of that Duracast line though.
659537,davey buoy,2012-01-23 19:12:00,5505,"Wire leader I would think,no matter what line your using."
659552,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-23 19:47:00,10439,  Or flourocarbon.
