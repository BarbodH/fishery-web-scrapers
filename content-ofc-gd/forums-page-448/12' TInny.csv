659306,justwannafish,2012-01-23 03:12:00,82,Hey I'm looking for some DIY instruction to help me make and install a casting deck on a 12' aluminum boat I picked up a few weeks ago. Does anyone know of a decent site with some helpful info? Or have any plans from one they've done themselves? I'm putting money away over the winter so I can get it built and ready to go for as soon as I can next season!! Pretty excited!  Any help is appreciated  Thanks a lot!!

659314,justwannafish,2012-01-23 03:42:00,82,Okay thanks for the advice I might just lay some ply to flatten the bottom out. I'll post pics once it's done
659315,paul_614,2012-01-23 03:46:00,168,I would second the idea of making a flat bottom
659331,JCRG,2012-01-23 05:04:00,57,tinboats.net Lots of info on there
659356,danbouck,2012-01-23 12:04:00,4380,Just lay ply on the floor. If you raise it on the front it may become unstable.
659378,Fishnwire,2012-01-23 13:30:00,983,There's an article in this month's Ontario Out of Doors about that.  It doesn't tell you a whole lot (like most of their articles) but might be worth a look.
659495,JustinHoffman,2012-01-23 16:53:00,482,"@justwannafish - I wrote a feature article in the latest issue of Ontario OUT OF DOORS magazine. It covers the basics of plywood selection, framework size, screws, carpeting, etc. It also offers tips on carpet, livewells, bilge pumps and bow-mounts/electronics. Should be a good starting point.  I also shot a companion video that you may find useful:    If you have any questions, just shoot me a note.  @fishNwire - Always love to hear comments (both good and bad) on what your experience is with the magazine. Any comments feel free to direct them to the Editor-in-Chief, John Kerr: [emailÂ protected] Best way to let us know how we are doing - or what improvements need to be made.  In terms of the article I wrote - I wanted to cover all of the basics (not just deck building) for giving your aluminum boat a makeover. Obviously, space constraints doesn't always allow us to go into in-depth detail on every topic we cover, but I think this piece does give the newbie ""boat builder"" some great starting points.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
659501,Lunker777,2012-01-23 16:57:00,866,http://www.tinboats.net/forum/index.php  Decked out my 15ft tinny a few years back..... there is NO better place for help on this topic !
659594,cjgraham,2012-01-23 22:14:00,104,Check out last months issue of Ontario out of doors. There is a big spread on revamping the old tinny
659598,biggs,2012-01-23 22:34:00,21,"I think I would just flatten the bottom out also but that Ontario out of Doors article and youtube video are helpful, worth a look."
659674,Raf,2012-01-24 02:08:00,3495,I hear there's an article in OOD which may or may not be helpful.
659676,Rizzo,2012-01-24 02:16:00,4754, what's an OOD? But on a totally unrelated manner I would suggest looking at Ontario out of Doors
659677,irishfield,2012-01-24 02:16:00,26272, Except for the part about using pressure treated wood.. sorry Justin.
659681,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 02:29:00,0,"personally, i'd watch what you put in a 12 foot tinny.  it doesn't take much weight to be plowing water in small boats."
659733,justwannafish,2012-01-24 11:41:00,82,Thanks guys Definitely helpful I'll post some before and after pics in the spring when it's all done  Can't wait to get out in my first tinny!
