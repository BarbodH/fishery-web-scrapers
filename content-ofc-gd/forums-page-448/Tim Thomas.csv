659877,blarg,2012-01-24 18:17:00,289," You seem to be for free will so long as your choices put you somewhere in the mushy middle of society, where conviction is a dirty word, and generally anything but liberal and progressive simply isn't acceptable. I don't care about what he did, the president is just a man, no more deserving of respect than you or I.  As far as being an extremist, most of the time great things don't get done by people who are more interested in lying with the sheep, right or wrong. The biggest problem you seem to have with what he did is not about the team but about what he believes in, the audacity, not self identifying as a progressive or a liberal, oh my.  Imagine if he was Canadian, he might have voted for Harper, oh my stars."

659793,12footspringbok,2012-01-24 15:11:00,459,"Good on ya for not showing to the White House.      Thomas statement on White House absence (via the NHL)  ""I believe the Federal government has grown out of control, threatening the Rights, Liberties, and Property of the People.  This is being done at the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial level. This is in direct opposition to the Constitution and the Founding Fathers vision for the Federal government.  Because I believe this, today I exercised my right as a Free Citizen, and did not visit the White House. This was not about politics or party, as in my opinion both parties are responsible for the situation we are in as a country. This was about a choice I had to make as an INDIVIDUAL.  This is the only public statement I will be making on this topic. TT"""
659795,bushart,2012-01-24 15:18:00,2628,I'm still wonderin about this  Are you taking the focus off a team's achievement and throwing the spotlight on yourself??  There usually are other opps to take a stand  And If the Prez invites you---and You don't show---Probably not getting another chance  I'm not a fan of our PM--but if i was invited--I'd go.
659801,DoubleDigits,2012-01-24 15:24:00,140,"What a dope. I wonder what rights and liberties this millionaire athlete has lost thanks to Obama??? None. Misinformation and anger, a popular and troubling combination."
659802,bigugli,2012-01-24 15:26:00,6138," I wouldn't waste the effort to "" pass wind in his general direction"", let alone go near him.  As for Thomas, he made a conscious choice and did what few are willing to do any more. Right or wrong, he acted on his principles."
659804,bushart,2012-01-24 15:29:00,2628,That's the part that's kind of buggin me  He did'nt win that cup on his own---yet he puts a cloud over the entire teams victory celebration  If he wanted to say something---there's lots of opps
659806,Roy,2012-01-24 15:30:00,13728,"Yes he did what his conscience told him to do so he should not be demonized for it. However, it's no secret that he's a Fox News buff and a huge fan of Glenn Beck so, you do the math."
659810,duxbware,2012-01-24 15:35:00,102,  Your right chances are none. But good on him for standing up and supporting those who may have lost their rights and liberties.  He may be a part of a championship team but he is a person with his own values and believes. Who are we to judge him????
659812,DoubleDigits,2012-01-24 15:42:00,140," Who are we to judge the public political statements of public figures?? I don't know...the public? No one in the US has lost ANY rights, or liberties due to Obama's admin. This is not debatable."
659814,Gregoire,2012-01-24 15:48:00,1397,"Even if he is pissed at Obama meeting the prez is not a political thing...but he made it into one. I respect the man for having an opinion, but not sure if he chose the correct manner to express it."
659817,Toronto_Angler,2012-01-24 15:53:00,698,You don't have to respect the person in power but you should at least respect the office of the country that allows you the freedom to make money and raise your family. He had no problem playing for the US Olympic team.  I Guess Tim Thomas didn't realize that it was his job to pump the presidents tires
659827,kickingfrog,2012-01-24 16:06:00,8333,I think he has bit off more then he planned on chewing. He is however within his rights to make himself look like a  fool.

659831,kickingfrog,2012-01-24 16:15:00,8333,Nice reference. Funny.
659833,blaque,2012-01-24 16:19:00,2419, That doesnt even make sense. Just because he's ashamed of the government that runs his country doesnt mean hes not proud of its citizens and what they stand for. His protest actually solidifies how much he cares for his country. He plays the game for the american people and those within the hockey community......not for the politicians. I would take much more pride and satisfaction in the cup parade in Boston than i would EVER take from a podium full of POLS.
659834,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 16:19:00,0,nothing but a selfish and unclassy move by a tea party nut. end of story.

659845,[email protected],2012-01-24 17:05:00,119,"  you're right, standing up for what you believe in, is unclassy and selfish. Let's all just tow the line.....baaa baaa"
659853,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 17:19:00,0,"  there are 365 days a year to voice your displeasure with the government.  you don't need to pick the day that your team is to be honoured by the whitehouse!  the president was democratically elected by the country he claims to love.  and tim is still towing the line, it's just that he's towing the right winged lunatic line and it makes him look like a buffoon (it does the same to anyone who supports him btw)."
659854,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 17:21:00,0," really?  because the citizens he's proud of democratically elected the president that he won't visit.  and i don't buy the ""this isn't partisan"" spiel for a moment...every one knows timmy is a right winged loonie!"
659857,12footspringbok,2012-01-24 17:29:00,459,"Come on Doc instead of resorting to 8th grade name calling tactics could we maybe try and keep this civil?  Like maybe posting some info on why Tim is a ""nut"" insead of just outright name calling. Your better than that honestly...."
659858,bushart,2012-01-24 17:30:00,2628,I agree Doc---He put his own interest ahead of the team  And without that very team---he would'nt have had this platform  Self serving at best
659859,[email protected],2012-01-24 17:30:00,119,"and tim is still towing the line, it's just that he's towing the right winged lunatic line and it makes him look like a buffoon (it does the same to anyone who supports him btw).   actually, it makes him appear more like a human that has free will, and chooses to exercise that right. those against his right to choose, are the buffoons, btw."

659863,[email protected],2012-01-24 17:33:00,119," read the article, it's all there in black and white."
659864,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-24 17:38:00,0,i don't feel the need to explain why any extremist is a nut.  tim thomas is no better than a loonie leftie from pita... no better than a loonie christian hating gays... no better than an extremist muslim hating women...   he's a small percentage of the population who embarrassed his hockey team by taking an event meant to honour the bruins and turning it into his own personal soapbox.   and i feel no guilt for calling tim any of those names as his actions have brought that reaction upon himself.
