659743,mercman,2012-01-24 12:44:00,7054," You know....i Thought the same thing, and was gonna type that,but i said to myself ""Myself"", i said, ""never mind, he probably already knows that"""
659317,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 04:00:00,8333,"This mild winter was getting to me and I had an itch that needed to be scratched. Last winter on this same weekend my brother and I did a day trip to Quinte. 22 hours return trip with 8 plus hours on the road due to a snow storm resulted in this:      This year I wanted to try Nipissing instead. Called around for a 2 man hut for Saturday and decided on Idle Tymes.  Weapons ready. Top three saw the most water/ice.   On the road by 4am, the 2 and a half hour drive was uneventful. Heading out on the ice well before sun up and lines in 33 feet of water not long after. The action was steady and the first walleye could not resist my brother's jiggin' rap.    The perch action was steady and we kept 20 or so between the two of us, many due to swimbladder issues.    Had a few eyes just into the slot...   ...And some that were not. This monster hit a small spoon tipped with a shiner half its length. Smallest one that we've caught on a lake that we've fished since we were in diapers.   Temps in the mid minus teens, no wind and sunny. Perfect weather.     While outside I had a mark come up on screen at 15 feet. It was interested in the jigawopper that I reeled up to it, but it would not commit. I reeled up my jiggin rap and felt the weight right a way. It was obvious that this was the biggest fish of the day. I called my brother out from the hut and mentioned that the camera should be on his person. Great fight right up until the fish came unhooked right at, but not on, the hole. Not much was said, or needed to be said, as we looked at each other. There were lines to be tended and fish still being marked on the finders. By the fight I am quite sure it was an eye and using the others caught as a guide it was likely out the other end of the slot, but we'll never know.  Back to work.   We kept a few walleye (don't worry my brother's monster still swims, and will be a line buster in 10-12 years) and a mess o' perch, no ling this trip.   The drive home was quiet with the exception of the mild snoring from the passenger seat. 18 hours round trip, 5 and a half hours on the road.  Might not get out on the ice too much more this season but the itch has been satiated... for a week or two.  Till next time."
659318,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-23 04:17:00,2690,"Awesome Rob!  Good to see you had a great time, with a nice feed to boot.  Juli and I loved our nightly perch (with a few walleye) dinners up there."
659357,mercman,2012-01-23 12:26:00,7054,Great report Rob!! I really enjoyed the read.Those Perch are gonna taste real good Heck of a good way to scratch an itch too
659358,mike rousseau,2012-01-23 12:31:00,4661,Those look like some nice perch...  Great report... Thanks
659359,Skipper D,2012-01-23 12:36:00,1970,"Totaly awsome , well worth it and i can't get over how much you guys look like  Dwanye ."
659360,Roy,2012-01-23 12:40:00,13728,Lookin' good guys! Looks like a fair amount of traffic out there too eh? Glad you and bro had a good time.
659363,Rod Caster,2012-01-23 12:55:00,5784,"That'll calm the blood for a bit. Too bad you missed that monster at the hole! Sounds like it would have been huge.  I still haven't properly fished Nip this year... Lack of a sled is really gettin' to me, as I don't want be driving my truck over deep water.  Great report Rob. Enjoy the filets."
659371,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 13:05:00,2449,"I love the hard-core double jigging set up. I am sooooooo lazy. I prefer the double tip-up set up lol. However, my only walleye this weekend was jigged up on a buckshot spoon tipped with a minnow head."
659374,bubbles,2012-01-23 13:09:00,591,"Great report, I love the last pic....  My fun time on nip is about 10 days away."
659377,Joey,2012-01-23 13:16:00,9122,"Great stuff Rob, I'm jealous"
659409,johnnyb,2012-01-23 14:22:00,3413,Nicely done....that's how you do a day trip for sure!  I've done it a couple times so far this year....tiring but worth it.  I like the double jigging setup....do you keep them at the same depth or different depths?
659413,adempsey,2012-01-23 14:26:00,1498,Nice to see a detailed ice fishing report.  Can't wait for mine!  Cheers!
659416,limeyangler,2012-01-23 14:29:00,5204,"Nice one Roberto and Bro.......thats a fine bag of supper you left the ice with, after that i think you will be out sooner rather than later...in the meantime apply plenty of lotion to the newly developing itch!"
659417,Harrison,2012-01-23 14:30:00,2202," Awesome report, nice eyeball.  I see your playing the ice version of Wii above, the Nippissing edition."
659426,bigugli,2012-01-23 14:43:00,6138,Looks like a great day out.
659474,Headhunter,2012-01-23 15:50:00,5703,Good shootin boys..... jusy over a month b4 I get to hit Nip! HH
659494,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 16:51:00,8333,"I kept the huts out of the shots. There are a few out fits right in that area, but we didn't feel crowded."
659499,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 16:56:00,8333,Can't multi reply from my phone.  I don't use set lines too much. Only  time was while cooking/eating some soup. My brother used one more but the perch were bait robbers. Most of our fish were marked and worked.
659504,kickingfrog,2012-01-23 17:05:00,8333,Depends on what I see on the screen. I fish my Jiggin rap from the bottom to about 2 feet up. My spoon or more agresive bait 2-5 feet off bottom. I only marked one suspended fish... And we know how that worked out.
659514,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 17:30:00,5865,Oh.......PERCH.....you can never have enough perch....
659562,DaveMc,2012-01-23 20:11:00,89,nice report
659638,biggs,2012-01-24 00:37:00,21,nice report!  nice pictures!  nice sack of perch!
659669,Leecher,2012-01-24 01:48:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Rob Thanks for sharing!!! Leechman"
659673,Grimace,2012-01-24 02:04:00,2020,"Well done.   Not much beats ice fishing with your brother, especially when you catch."
659694,Bassnbows,2012-01-24 03:15:00,58,"Great report. Glad to hear that Shawn and Terra at Idyl Tyme put you on fish. There really nice people and know where the fish are. Ive been going there for a few years now, and heading up there the first weekand of Feb. can wait.  Good fishin."
