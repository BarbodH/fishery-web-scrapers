These government employess are ""experts"" though who have worked in the field for years...they couldn't possibly get something wrong could they?? I think that's why many government agencies accomplish nothing - its safer. When they actually do something they screw it up. Better to just do nothing and say you're ""studying"" it...then when someone else comes into power you start studying something else."

657152,mercman,2012-01-16 21:55:00,7054,  I just did mine on-line Ron.Took 3 minutes and i just printed the copy.I can use it till mine comes in the mail in a few weeks.
657158,Skipper D,2012-01-16 22:10:00,1970, Iwas on line earlier and there was no where i could hand them my cash . I hate paying on line with plastic and all the junk mail that comes after it .
657221,Sharkbait22,2012-01-16 23:44:00,297,I just got my card in th email today. I went through the phone service in late November.  Odd enough the card looks exactly like my old one.  I thought there was a change coming.  Regardless I'm happy.  I carried my visa statement with me the last two trips.
657228,camillj,2012-01-16 23:52:00,1988,I bought mine online about a month and a half ago ... it just arrived today .. not that I was too worried as you can print your own temporary version. Anyhow .. I am good for another 3 years .. woo hoo !
657238,Grimace,2012-01-17 00:11:00,2020,I bought mine online in November.  Arrived today.
657311,Snidley,2012-01-17 04:19:00,620,Took 2 minutes at Canadian Tire in Oakville. Silly that they give you a second licence to carry with your outdoor card though.

659434,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 14:51:00,5865,What's mind boggling is all they are doing after you order and PAY online is sending you a friggen piece of paper....that shouldn't take more then 5 days to your house.....am I missing something here....I ordered mine almost 3 weeks ago and still nothing...
659437,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-23 14:52:00,2690,  Ordered Juli's six weeks ago...still using the piece of paper

653652,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 18:45:00,5865," 1) you're required in PA to wear your fishing license on your hat.  2) we are are required in NYS to wear our Hunting License on our backs while hunting...and I have EVERY hunting license since I was issued one in 1970 and none have dissolved, ESPECIALLY the new DECAL licenses....maybe your chewing on yours....  Learn the laws...then make fun of them.....  Bob....."
653655,BillM,2012-01-05 18:57:00,17367,"Who's making fun of the laws?   I'm laughing at the fact that NYS hasn't figured out how to make licenses that can't stand up to being in the front pocket of a pair of waders for less then 12 months.  BTW, if you actually fished PA, you'd realize the CO's aren't to worried when people don't wear their licenses on their hats..  (And yes, I am very well aware what's required)"
653656,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 19:09:00,5865," I was....oh wait, I was actually making fun of you....LOL  And I hunted and fished PA for years....but now our deer hunting and fishing is so much better in NYS so why would I purchase their license..."

Bill, you need to get up to date on this things....  Got to go...we'll talk later....you have a lot to learn about NYS  Bob"

653680,Rod Caster,2012-01-05 20:08:00,5784,"  Apparently I bought a ""canadian"" sport license, not an Ontario sport license. They said I chose the wrong options online. ... yet my mailing and billing address were both Ontario based and updated at the time of purchase. How can it be otherwise??? Of course it's my fault, as the MNR's system is flawless.  Well, no big deal, I can reapply for my sport license in a couple days and they will mail me a $51.77 sometime in the next two months hahahaha."
654633,fishinmortician,2012-01-08 19:30:00,100,Just spent 45 minutes renewing mine and my wifes at crappy tire. The lady said they are trained on the new system over the phone... she had no clue.  Now I have a card and a big honkin sticker to lose this year.  Hope my time is paid back in fish!
654654,DaveMc,2012-01-08 20:46:00,89,"As a licence issuer I recieved the new LAS equipment in december and have been lucky so far that i am not having many issues. there are minor things that pop up frequently but i have been able to figure out a way to work around almost all of our issues myself or with the help of another local issuer. is this system a pain in the butt? yup. it takes longer to get through a licence than the paper copies did, and we make the same pennies for issuing that we did before.  The oh so fun postal code error the machines are prone to getting, there is a work around for that in certain situations, another local issuer found it and it seems to be working just fine. i wont go into it here, but if there are any licence issuers here that are having that problem feel free to message me (or call the number in my signature) and i will let you know.  one of the biggest pains in the butt is that if we need assistance issuing a licence we need to call the same 800 number half of ontario is calling (the outdoors card centre) as they handle ALL software and licence issues (huge pain when there is a customer waiting for a licence to go fishing the same day and we have to wait 40min to get through). for hardware issues we need to call the company in Tennessee that supplied the hardware. The reason that was explained to me for choosing a US based company for the hardware is there are only 3 companies in North America that supply this type of equipment, they are ALL based out of the US. the company that supplied our hardware also has the equipment in place and operational in 30 states through out the US. the bulk of the problems is software related (supplied by the MNR i believe) The MNR are trying to make a push toward a more streamlined system like that being used in many states throughout the US.  when you get a fishing licence for 2012 you will receive a yellow tag, its is separate from the outdoors card, yes you have to carry it with you when fishing and yes you are still required to carry your outdoors card. For those that both hunt and fish, good luck as you will have a tag for each licence you buy.  since the members here seem to spread throughout canada and parts of the US and also because i happen to have some info here i will also list fees for some of the licences. (as big game licences and fees arent available yet)  Ontario Resident  Outdoors Card (new, renewal and duplicate) - $9.68 Sport Fishing Licence 1 day - $12.67 Sport Fishing Licence 1 year - $27.76 Sport Fishing Licence 3 year - $83.39 Conservation Fishing Licence 1 year - $15.90 Conservation Fishing Licence 3 year - $47.70  Small Game Licence 1 year - $23.46 Small Game Licence 3 year - $70.38 Spring Turkey Licence/Game Seal - $27.49  Canadian Resident (outside of Ontario)  Outdoors Card (new, renewal and duplicate) - $9.68 Sport Fishing Licence 1 day - $12.67 Sport Fishing Licence 1 year - $51.77 Sport Fishing Licence 3 year - $155.30 Conservation Fishing Licence 1 year - $31.00 Conservation Fishing Licence 3 year - $92.99  Small Game Licence 1 year - $112.46 Small Game Licence 3 year - $337.37 Spring Turkey Licence/Game Seal - $27.49  Non Canadian Resident  Outdoors Card (new, renewal and duplicate) - $9.68 Sport Fishing Licence 1 day - $21.31 Sport Fishing Licence 8 day - $50.15 Sport Fishing Licence 1 year - $78.18 Sport Fishing Licence 3 year - $234.55 Conservation Fishing Licence 8 day - $28.84 Conservation Fishing Licence 1 year - $48.26 Conservation Fishing Licence 3 year - $144.79  Small Game Licence 1 year - $112.46 Small Game Licence 3 year - $337.37 Spring Turkey Licence/Game Seal - $27.49  Duplicate Licence Fee is $10.50 (this is separate from the outdoors card duplicate)"

I got my renewal in 5 minutes today at c tire.The associate said the problem they were having was with postal codes being input incorrectly from MNR.Every time it happens he has to call Alabama,Freakin Alabama !!   The database is in the states. Better than China I guess.Anyhow , my CTC is aware of the government mess and had me in and out in 10 with a call to the southern states. The problem is with incorrect postal codes. Hope this helps."

I am in construction, I have to carry on me around 10 card that enable me to work, now cards to fish it is just a cash grab.  We already have a great card system goind our drivers licence with the magnetic strip.  Why can;t we just combined our boating fishing driving health etc, one one simple card if service ontario does it all why do have to deal with a george castanza sized wallet.  I'm just going to say it,  this new system just plain sucks."
655122,DaveMc,2012-01-10 02:08:00,89," no the problem with the postal codes has to do with not having the outdoorscard number we have found (nothing to do with the postal code at all).  The company that provided the equipment is from Tennessee, and they do not maintain any of the MNR databases, they only provide tech support for the equipment, the Outdoors Card Centre here in Canada maintains the Licence Database. Anything to do with licencing issues go through the outdoorscard centre (made many calls into tech support, they will not handle anything to do with the licencing side)"
655124,DaveMc,2012-01-10 02:11:00,89," Thats how it is done in Michigan, and how i figured we were going to do it as well (considering this company supplied Michigan's equipment) but i guess not."

652844,BassAsin,2012-01-03 06:55:00,806,"  From what i have heard, if you purchased a 2012 fishing license in the year 2011 it was 27.76   if purchased in 2012 the price is 51.77.   what a crock of the brown stuff.  a heads up on the changes would have been nice, myself and my father included both work for the MNR and didn't even have a heads up on the new system change or the price change, thankfully i was able to purchase a license in 2011 while the system was up and running.   even funnier, if a store owner has issues with the system they have an assistance line they can call,    heres the funny part,  they get to talk to somebody in tennesse. about an ON, fishing license."
652848,davey buoy,2012-01-03 09:18:00,5505,"Picked up mine yesterday,$27.76 is the 2012 price for a 1 year sport license."
652867,Rod Caster,2012-01-03 12:57:00,5784," I just assumed it was mistake. If they are trying punish me for waiting one extra day, I guarantee they'll be seeing/hearing from me loud and clear. I don't mind a few glitches, but such an increase is insane. And for the Tennessee thing... Go figure, here we are dealing with the lowest bidder."
652872,irishfield,2012-01-03 14:28:00,26272," Something is wrong there Chad.. it says right on the renewal form that the one year licence fees listed are in effect from Jan 1, 2012 to Dec 31 2012. The three year licence fees are subject to change after Aug 31 2012."

It took me a few minutes online to renew for 3 years and I have paper copy printed until my card arrives plus I have it saved as a pdf copy so if I ever lose my paper copy I am good.

Hiltop Variety in North Bay was supposed to be the test-retailer for the new system however they were shut down on account that they were charged with possesion of child porn  I'm gonna have to print off my Visa statement because they didn't send me a receipt (thx MNR) and bring it in to the Service Ontario crew to get an explanation/refund on my 51.77   Bob: probably true... they would have been made from arsenic coated iridium plates."

Go to your local newspaper, get them interested and make them look like complete morons, not that it would take much."
653403,Fish Farmer,2012-01-05 01:01:00,2234,"I talked to a friend last night that is a MNR officer in my area. He said we are going to have the same system as the states. They'll be a few glitches till things are working properly. Hunting license, when you buy a deer license it goes directly into the system and your bar code on the license, no paper sticker. You'll be mailed your deer tag. He said the system works better than the card. Maybe Billy Bob can shed some light."
653413,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 01:36:00,5865," Like I said earlier, when the new DECAL system went into affect it was almost impossible to get a license....was seriously considering going without one that year...but now it's a fine system.  Here in NYS we probably do thing a bit different, but I'll try to explain our easy system.  Our hunting / fishing licenses run from October 1st to Sept 30th....with our new licenses available around mid August each year. Once your in the DECAL system you no longer need to bring a hunting license with you as proof that you hunted prior and have passed a hunter safety course....so that's good....when we in NYS apply for our big game license we have the option ($10) to pick in a instant lottery for 2 anterless (doe) tags in any deer management area of your choice....the state puts out info prior to you picking on which areas have a high, medium, low or none chance to get your tags.....this is another good thing because you get all your tags right there and then...  I am told you can purchase these DECAL licenses online but it's just easier for me to go down to the town clerk's office and get it there....they print your license and all your tags at once as they come off the printer tagged together....this license is easily folded and fits in you wallet without a problem....it is also coated to be waterproof...  Once in the system you can go to any place that sells NYS hunting / fishing license as the computer has all your info from years past....all you need is last years license OR your driver's license for ID proof...so is also good for those who lose their hunting / fishing license or haven't renewed in several years.  I'm sure once the bugs are filtered out you will be able to purchase a license in short order....try EARLY in the morning when the system isn't being bombarded with request....I got mine in a matter of minutes at 5am the other day.  Bob"
653435,Fish Farmer,2012-01-05 02:41:00,2234,"Thanks Bob, that helps to clear the air   It's all about change. Old people sometimes don't like change because their programed the old way.

653604,BillM,2012-01-05 16:25:00,17367,"The plastic NYS licenses will almost be completely unreadable after a few weeks rubbing around in a plastic ziplock.  As soon as I get mine I put a strip of duct tape over the front and back so the information doesn't get rubbed off.   The last thing I need is a DEC officer up my behind because the license is almost impossible to read.  Also, expiring on Sept 30th is a crock."

652485,irishfield,2012-01-02 00:23:00,26272,"  Unfortunately that's the price Kelvin, as I'm staring at the renewal form for our youngest daughter. $83.29 + 9.68 for the card. Was waiting for her to come home for Christmas, as the new notices don't even have a card number on them like the old forms had, so I didn't want to call in without her card number...and she forgot it anyhow! I really hate to even try the system with all the ""reviews"" here. I could never renew online with an apostrophe in our last name and always had to fill in the form and mail it back. So they've taken the extra postage / handling work out of the cost of the system, not added any new CO's and raised the rates to fish our own waters. NICE!  Guys are gonna start playing russion roulette and forego buying licences and take the fine if caught."
652487,Grimace,2012-01-02 00:29:00,2020,"I paid 92.97 for the 3 year and card.  That was 6 weeks ago and so far no card has arrived.  My printer took a crap so I didn't get the chance to print off a temporary.  They did not send me an email confirmation like a normal purchase would go, so now I do not believe I have anything to print.  Looks like I am stuck waiting for the card."
652490,Bluegill,2012-01-02 00:39:00,197,"New Licence...  Service Canada: We don't have that! Go to Trading Post! Trading Post: What? We don't have anything. Try online.  Not possible online, no info online! Could order a one day licence online. What's up here? Wrote an email. Answer after 2 days: Can not renew my licence before Dec 16. Aha!  Started online early on Dec 16 and all was fine. After paying with credit card I clicked on the button for printing the temporary licence.  With that click my computer crashed. Ha! No, I don't write about my blood pressure at this moment!  After a phone call, it takes me just 20 minutes for waiting, bad music btw, a friendly guy said he will send me the licence with mail. It arrived just in time on Dec 30. Thank you!!  Please, mnr, there is time enough the whole year. Why not allow to renew the licence earlier than middle Dec??"
652495,cheaptackle,2012-01-02 00:52:00,849,"Bluegill - you wouldn't mean a system that might break the effort up throughout the year would you?  I dunno - lemme take a stab at this - something like divide the population by 12, maybe triggered by the month of their birthday or some such STUPID idea like that, thus also allowing a full 12 months of fishing for each year paid for?  Would such a system involve making life easier for all and spreading the demand across a full year instead of a single holiday laden period?  But WHERE would one find a working model or two to base such a system on to save creating one from scratch? But I guess having to get my fishing license, car license plate sticker and driver's license renewals in the same month that ISN'T December just wouldn't make a whole lot of sense now would it? ( at MNR, not  at Bluegill) Wanna bet that the current system gets replaced by something similar to auto licensing in the next couple years?  Michael"
652499,Grimace,2012-01-02 01:04:00,2020, That is odd.  I renewed mine online in the middle of November.  I still have not received anything from them.
652507,Roy,2012-01-02 01:17:00,13728,On the first page of the online renewal application it states:  ATTENTION Please be advised that Outdoors Cards renewed or purchased in November and December will be mailed in January.  Not saying it's good but it does sound clear to me.
652508,Bluegill,2012-01-02 01:21:00,197," Grimace, I would phone them!  Btw: After 3 days I found my temporary licence in my tmp-files!! If your computer crashed after you could see the licence, like my computer, and you know the date than it is possible that your temp licence is still on your computer. If you deleted your tmp-files than you are out of luck. So, phone them and good luck."
652514,Grimace,2012-01-02 01:43:00,2020," I must have missed that as I was in a rush. It would have not even been an issue if my printer was functioning.  I was a little dissapointed that I was not emailed a bill with an attachment to print my license like most online businesses. Air Canada and WestJet will send you confirmation with a ticket to print and the same goes with ticketmaster and the like.  Thems the brakes.  No ice near me anyways.  I think the system is severely flawed.  I get my non resident NYS decal almost immediately every year.   But again, had my printer been working I would have been fine."
652516,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-02 01:46:00,0,"i can tolerate them having trouble with the system if they don't expect to check any licenses until all the backlogged online renewals are cleared up.  problem is, from what i've gathered online and on the telephone is that they do expect people to just wait at home and that's Bull."

652576,Billy Bob,2012-01-02 10:24:00,5865,"OK gentlemen (and I use that term very loosely here...LOL) if this backward Redneck can figure out how to purchase a Ontario fishing license and renew a outdoor card (joke) I think you guys can too....LOL  Seriously, I just renewed both without a hitch. I was in the process of doing it the day after Christmas but when I got to confirm purchase I couldn't find anywhere that is said I was purchasing a 2012 fishing license. So that scared me off of finalizing the purchase. I didn't really need another 2011 license....but this time I finished the process and then it showed I purchased a 2012 fishing license and renewed my outdoor card.  The system was probably overloaded with request when many of you guys were online applying....but a 5am this morning it worked like a dream.  Now all we need to do is get this license fee more in reality....a one year fishing license at $77.76 is a LOT of money IMHO.... ...more money to government agencies the more money wasted..."
652577,Spouph,2012-01-02 10:48:00,115,"Wow it sounds like I struck a nerve..  Now here is somthing I thought about yesterday as I was trying to get a licence for a friend that had come up for opener.  We went to a local bait store and the guy said he could not ger the new system.  So what bothers me no is how much more abuse can the little bait shops take.  You go in get your licence some bait, and mabey some tackle.  But if you have to go to canadian tire (which is my favorite store) you just pick uo your tackle there and all you get at the bait store is bait.  Man cannot live on minnows alone.  I guess what I am saying is SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BAIT STORE the community where I came from the local bait store closed after being there for 30 plus years.  From that point on the next closest reliable store was an hour away.  What ever money that was saves by buying tackle at ct went out the window in gas and frustration.....  So i went to ct to buy minnows, well you all know how that went!!!!"
652715,davey buoy,2012-01-02 20:31:00,5505,"When I went to CT today,all went well because they say,my postal code hasn't changed in the last 3 years. But really, gave me a sticker copy for $27.76 if I'm correct, and it is the same size as the outdoor card. Can't just put a sticker as previously said as my card only had one on it. Two other people were still waiting as I left because they had moved in the last year. What was wrong with the sticker program? Any way I stuck it behind my card and as they say we need two pieces now.Who is re-thinking the rules. Just another rant,but now I'm ready to go for the year..Go.od 2012 for everyone I hope. davey"
652724,Sinker,2012-01-02 20:54:00,8692," Same here. Total Bull.  I'm going regardless. Give me the ticket, I'll see ya in court for sure.  I need a small game license for the morning, and a fishing license for the afternoon.  Over $50 for a fishing only license?? What the hell???  Price never seems to go down, but that is almost double from last year!!!!  S."

Some might try to get away with out it if the price keeps going in this fashion. They might start to hurt the industry even more now.. will have to wait and find out more..
652805,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-03 02:22:00,0," The machines that issue the licenses are from a company in Tennessee.  If the operator called the head office of the company, they can tell the retailer what postal code they have on file but it will likely take 10-20 minutes."

652817,ctdd2006,2012-01-03 03:20:00,531," I went fishing yesterday for the first time EVER without a valid license.  Wasn't proud about it...but I wasn't staying home either.  Lesson learned though...my renewal notice was mailed to me two months ago!  When I was trying to renew online the system kept crashing and giving me ""error"" messages.....I printed them off and carried my last card with my last three stickers on it as an effort to show I always buy a license and will again!!!????  I'd like to think most CO's are fair. We had the same problem here two years ago when nobody had stickers to sell till mid jan. and I don't remember anyone getting slapped"
652842,OutdoorDan,2012-01-03 06:27:00,325," From my experience COs don't really start coming out too much until February.  Also you should be in their computer system if you bought a license but haven't received it yet, so even if a CO does catch you, you should be okay.  FWIW I think what is going on with the licensing is a joke and I am not defending it, I'm just saying that I doubt they are out to get the people that renewed their license and don't have it yet.  They are also likely aware of the issues/shortages so again I doubt we are going to see a lot of COs until February."
652326,Spouph,2012-01-01 00:40:00,115,Just got my licence for next year it is a peice of plastic like thin.....  what happened to the stickers do our cards need to be carried or do both cards need to be carried..  Is it just a canadian tire thing or does the tackle shops offer the stickers.  anyone ???????????
652328,DMASSE,2012-01-01 00:48:00,420,Yes you have to carry both the yellow piece of paper plus your card.   Only wayaround it is renew your outdoor card and a 3 year sticker  We at gagnons are one of 4 places that sell them.  What a joke

So the lady on the phone was able to reset my lisence and I renued it for 3 years online so i wouldnt have to deal with it every year   She said they have had a lot of extra phone calls this year due to the new system.
