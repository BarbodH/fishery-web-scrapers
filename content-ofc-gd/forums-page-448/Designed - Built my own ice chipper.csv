658996,NAW,2012-01-22 02:35:00,4022,"Loosing one down the hole gives you a chance to make a newer, better one with out having to convince the wife."
658998,richyb,2012-01-22 02:38:00,774,"Nice spud. I should make a new one also. The couple I have are now in ""S"" shapes from prying up my hut lol"
658999,irishfield,2012-01-22 02:39:00,26272,Starting to think a lot of you guys should be carring a welding magnet and 100 feet of rope!!
659000,NAW,2012-01-22 02:41:00,4022,"Funny, I was thinking the same thing.."
659126,Billy Bob,2012-01-22 18:24:00,5865,It works great to get built up ice off the driveway too.
659185,NAW,2012-01-22 21:36:00,4022,My driveway is gravel.  I like to keep a good layer of packed snow or ice.  Saves the plastic chute on my snowblower.
659186,vinnimon,2012-01-22 21:44:00,2593,Nice job on the spud  I made one of my own a few years back and only used to break the ice around my door step. I will get a pic of it when I get a chance. I used rebar and a castor rear axle shim from a mack truck
659219,motion,2012-01-22 23:42:00,403,Nice job there Nick. You're right in that knurling is tough on the hands. I suggest you wrap some rubber tape around the handle. It will give you a good grip and provide some insulation from the cold DOM tube. Let me know if you need some. I may be coming up to the GTG and can bring you a roll.  Tony
659325,newb09,2012-01-23 04:39:00,49,"Good job man.  I m just curious, how long would it take to make a hole with a tool like that.?"
659339,Skipper D,2012-01-23 08:40:00,1970,"I have some here i made up if any one wants to know , i used 2"" trailer balls on the ends of them , makes them pack a bit more weight to the punch and fits the palm of your hand nice  less'ning the shock ."
659351,misfish,2012-01-23 11:07:00,29133, Yep
659407,NAW,2012-01-23 14:19:00,4022," Thanks for the offer.  I think I'll keep it bare metal for now though.  See you this weekend!   Depends on ice thickness, and how much energy you have.  I use it more for cleaning up holes for my hut.  I drill a figure 8 with my auger (two holes slightly over lapping).  Then use the chipper to open the two holes up to a slot.  This matches up with the holes cut in the floor of my hut.  9"" Dia auger, works out to a slot 9"" wide, by 16"" long.  They are also very good if you go back to the same holes the next day, and need to clean out an inch or two of ice."
659483,DanD,2012-01-23 16:09:00,2223,"Just an idea if you did want to cover the tee handle; is this stuff from Loctite. Itâ€™s a liquid rubber compound that when it dries, sticks like baby crap to a blanket. It comes in different colours (the rubber not the crap); red would make it very visible, lying out in the snow.  Dan. "
658620,NAW,2012-01-21 02:02:00,4022,"It's not finished yet, but here's a few pics anyhow.  Her name is ""Bud"".  The Spud....    You know.  From the bright red mud    The main pole and handle are 1"" OD - 0.090"" wall DOM tube.  The head is 4140 PH.      This is round 2, the first angle didn't cut ice very well.  If this angle chops good, then I'm going to case harden the head.  It's 28-32 HRC right now.  Hope to bring it up to around 50 HRC.  There's knurling on the handle.  A note, if you plan on making our own.  Don't knurl do deep.  It's really hard on my office hands.  I need to wear gloves to chop holes with this thing!    I slapped a quick sheath together just for the time being.  It's made of steel re-enforced timing belt (brecoflex 100 AT 10).  Currently I just have two peaces of rubber straps to hold the sheath on.  With little tabs to you can pull them off and to the side with your gloves on.  I'm going to make the design a little ""sexier"" when I get more time.  This will do for now.  Hopefully I don't loose it.. (White sheath..White snow )      The finishing touches will be a nice coat of paint.  And 1"" increment markings on the main pole, from the top of the cutting head up.  This way, once you chop a hole, you can hook the head under the ice, and measure the thickness."
658624,NAW,2012-01-21 02:10:00,4022,  Just in case any of the youngsters don't know who Bud the Spud is..
658628,mercman,2012-01-21 02:16:00,7054,Met the man in Carleton Place 30 years ago. The Mississippi Hotel. Got tanked with him after his set. What a Character. Excellent chipper.  Think about putting a lanyard on it in case it slips out of your hands when it breaks through the botton of the hole.
658632,Skipper D,2012-01-21 02:22:00,1970,"Just curious Nick , is the T handle made so its wider then the hole in the ice would be so it can never be lost , it sure looks nice , you did an awsome job ."
658634,Nipfisher,2012-01-21 02:25:00,2449,Put a loop of rope through the handle Nick. I know there are at least 2 nice spuds on the bottom of Nipissing.
658635,mercman,2012-01-21 02:26:00,7054,  copy cat
658643,NAW,2012-01-21 02:45:00,4022," The good old days eh!  I was thinking about a rope thru the handle.    For a guy who doesn't Ice fish, you sure seem to have a good sense about how things work..   Yes..  And my brand new LED Mag Light. Directly under where your hut was last year  A lanyard is good.  But what do you do.  Wrap it around your wrist when your hacking a hole?  I was trying to think of some way to make it float, but I can't think of anything that's not bulky.."
658644,NAW,2012-01-21 02:46:00,4022,wups.  The Vodka made me double post...
658645,mercman,2012-01-21 02:51:00,7054,just a loop to slide your hand through. Its too well made to chance letting it lay to rest beside the maglite and Skeeters 4 pairs of sunglasses.
658646,BillM,2012-01-21 02:53:00,17367,"I'd definitely have a rope around my wrist if I was using that thing.   I could easily see me trying to be Hercules and it ending up at the bottom of lake Simcoe, lol."
658664,FishAbout,2012-01-21 03:52:00,106,If you put at V notch on the tip of the point it will chip the ice better. Did that with mine and works great.
658682,John Bacon,2012-01-21 04:26:00,3277," If you are outside in January or February, standing in the middle of a lake, holding on to a piece of metal... wouldn't you want to be wearing gloves anyway?  The deep knurles will provide a better grip."
658721,Skipper D,2012-01-21 09:05:00,1970, Now you know why i don't have to ice fish....................lol
658745,NAW,2012-01-21 13:19:00,4022," I was also thinking about something like that.  My fishing partner make one similar to this one.  But his had a step in the blade.  Hopefully I can test it out this weekened, and fine tune things before I case harden the head.  Thanks for the input guys.  I put a rope through the handle last night."
658752,Skipper D,2012-01-21 13:40:00,1970,"You get out there and enjoy Nick, ta hell what any body says , just remember nail clippers are for toe nails not ice chippers ..Attention! , o'ya soldier in this case stand at eass . Have fun ."
658757,skeeter,2012-01-21 14:09:00,1907, Hey Hey Hey. Those are reading glasses not sunglasses.  :tease:
658758,Joeytier,2012-01-21 14:14:00,3990,...So you won't be needing an auger next Saturday
658764,Spiel,2012-01-21 14:29:00,9065,"Looks solid and well built Nick.  I've built several myself over the years due to friends losing them down the hole and if I could offer one bit of advice (beyond adding a rope) it would be to keep the cutting end at about 1"" in width."
658776,Rod Caster,2012-01-21 16:10:00,5784,"Don't hit a rock with it. ""BOINGGG"".  Heavier is better with those things, my bro has a real old one made with a wood handle and a very large metal tip and its very heavy.. Three hits and he's thru 6 inches of ice. My 4inch finbore is still faster though hahaha  This should made your early season/unknown lake adventures a little safer! Nice piece!"
658903,skeeter,2012-01-21 23:16:00,1907,Why not put a 3 foot piece of rope on it and tie it to your float suit belt?
658904,NAW,2012-01-21 23:18:00,4022,Thanks for the comments guys.  I tested it out today.  It just rips through the ice.
658905,Skipper D,2012-01-21 23:23:00,1970,"Just like we knew it would ,,,,,,,,,,,,lol"
658906,Leecher,2012-01-21 23:23:00,7832,Nice spud bud    Kidding Nick... glad it worked out nicely for you!  Good work

658979,ketchenany,2012-01-22 02:07:00,3229, I know where there is one off 9th line Oro in 46 feet of water and it has a rope the noobie didn't know what the rope was used for
