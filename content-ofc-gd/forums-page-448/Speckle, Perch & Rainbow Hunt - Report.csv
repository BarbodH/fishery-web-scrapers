659238,Leecher,2012-01-23 00:37:00,7832,"Just got back from another outing... spent the day with my good friend Paul     The plan was to target a couple of lakes, one for specks early morning  and the other, late afternoon for rainbows  Was another cold one today... when I woke up, it was -22C and no wind... Perfect    so we left at 7h00am, pit stop to Tims and the way we go  First lake we got into minnow size speckles, about a dozen between the two of us and that was about it... hour and a half was the time we spent trying to entice the bigger ones but alas... they just did not want to play  So we packed up and headed further north... This lake is new to me but Paul had fished it before and knew the hot spots    So we proceeded to setup close to shore and see if the trout were active.... nada    So Paul suggested that we move towards the middle to tease perch.  Well upon arriving at our new spot, Paul drilled a few holes (around ten)  He got setup and immediately got to work... The guy is a fishing machine    He got perch right, left and centre jigging a 1/8oz buckshot... I got mine jigging a Macho Minnow tip with a 1"" Gulp minnow    Double headers happen often and was lot's of fun    We iced around 40 of them between the two of us and kept a few big ones for the pan  Here's a couple of slabs    Later in the afternoon, around 3h00pm, Paul suggested we move closer to shore and try for some rainbows... not a minute goes by upon arriving and getting setup to our new spot and get a huge hit on my dead stick  To my surprise, this was no perch    hand bomb this beauty chrome on ice    15"" long by 9"" girth    Paul started drilling more holes after that but ran out of gas in the auger     So says to me ""I'll bring the auger to the car and return""   So while he's gone, I proceeded to wait for him and jig.  A good 5 minutes went by before I see Paul walking back and this is when I get a huge strike, set the hook hard and the reel started burning   This fish was peeling line like a freight train   and was trying to get it up the hole but didn't want any of it  After an awesome battle, was able to land my new PB... a 20"" long by 10"" girth chrome  Here's the pic of my beauty    All in all it was a fun time out on the hard stuff!!! Bait of choice was: 1/8oz Buckshot, 1/4oz Macho Minnow tip with 1"" Gulp minnow, dew worms on dead stick  Thanks again Paul for an awesome time Until next time Leechman"
