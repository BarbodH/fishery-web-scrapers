I have a 2009 Nitro X 4 with a 50 HP Mercury 2 Stroke.  My starting battery died on me the other night while I was in the middle of the shipping lane on the St. Clair River.  I need to replace the battery, and I am unsure of what to get  I will also be running a hummingbird 898 of this battery   Not sure of what cranking amps I need to have and to be honest I don't know anything about electrical...lol\  Any help would be appreciated.

851501,davew3,2014-05-02 12:57:00,430,"Check the size of your battery holder first.  Find the highest cold cranking amps you can with the longest reserve.  I am looking at buying two this year.  Canadian Tire seems too have a pretty good price range.  Group 27    730 cranking amps,   100 amp hrs and 116 min reserve  decent price  regards"

They actually pay people to figure this out so the rest of us don't need to ""think about it"""
