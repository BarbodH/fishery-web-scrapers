I was not one of the hundreds i saw fishing the spawning fish, snagging and ripping fishing from the reds...  Managed to get my new PB Steelhead, beat my previous by about 5"" and 5-6lbs...  No clue how long it really was, or how much it weighed, but it was a big boy!!     Hope everyone else had fun out there!"
