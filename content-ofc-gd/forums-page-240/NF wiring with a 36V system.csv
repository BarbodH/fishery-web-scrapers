I'm having issues finding th correct placement of the power an ground wires. The Led will run on 3-30 volt systems so it's just a matter of isolating a battery or two, however for some reason all my electrical knowledge has some how leaked out of my brain this week. Any electronics people have a suggestion for me? Thanks"

Lets say you want to run the headlight on 12 volts, connect the positive lead of the headlight to the positive terminal of any of the six batteries. Then connect the negative lead to the negative terminal of the next battery in the series. You'll then have 12 volts for the headlight.  Dan."
