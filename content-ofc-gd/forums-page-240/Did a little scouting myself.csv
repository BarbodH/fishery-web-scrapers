This was as close as I could get.They seemed to have a yellowish lateral line.A good 18-24"",some bigger. "

851436,davey buoy,2014-05-01 23:56:00,5505,"White Suckers Thanks,some of the aggresiveness of these fish to each other was something to watch.From what I heard it's a full time job to keep the fly fishers away from them in that area."
851438,BillM,2014-05-02 00:04:00,17367,"Yup, suckers for sure.  Good pike bait!"
851439,davey buoy,2014-05-02 00:05:00,5505,"Yup, suckers for sure.  Good pike bait! They were as big or bigger than some pike I have caught lol."
851460,Joeytier,2014-05-02 02:19:00,3990,Suckers are tasty.  You should go catch a bunch and can 'em...hopefully you wont like them and then you can send them up to me!!
851461,Gerritt,2014-05-02 02:36:00,6129,Ewwwwww.......
851470,Musky or Specks,2014-05-02 03:25:00,2710,Ewwwwww....... Canned sucker is a staple in the north and quite tasty. Caught in the cold water in the spring.
851485,misfish,2014-05-02 10:51:00,29133,Yes they are tasty. Only from cold water though. Meat is firm.
851490,Gallie,2014-05-02 11:21:00,1215,"I wouldnt eat suckers but i sure can attest to their aggresiveness, last year while pike fishing near a river mouth my buddy caught two back to back on a 6 inch williams whitefish. The first one was a surprise the second one we watched it follow and continue to try smacking the spoon till it got hooked. I cant imagine it was trying to eat a spoon like that so i guess they are just feisty.  As for pike bait..."
