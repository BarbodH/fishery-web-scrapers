851403,jjcanoe,2014-05-01 20:36:00,744,Stampede ranch on Woodlawn east of the Hanlon expwy
851414,porkpie,2014-05-01 21:34:00,2521,"Angels diner on Wellington St at Gordon, or Vienna restaurant on MacDonnell street in the downtown.  If I had to choose one or the other, it would be the Vienna.  Also close to the game.  I probably wouldn't go with Stampede myself, but your mileage may vary!"
851463,kickingfrog,2014-05-02 02:44:00,8333,Thanks for the tips.  On a side note. What is the going rate for parking?
851466,trevy727,2014-05-02 02:51:00,351,Free parking. Corner of fountain st. E and Neeve st. Western hotel burgers and steaks. Right downtown beside arena. Park and walk to food and game.

851525,trevy727,2014-05-02 15:54:00,351,I wouldn't waste my time coming to Guelph. North bay is going to lose and you'll be able to see the cup up there after game #4.  :-)
851526,kickingfrog,2014-05-02 15:59:00,8333,"I've also got tickets to the Memorial Cup. Besides, I'm a Colts fan first."

851660,kickingfrog,2014-05-03 04:38:00,8333,"Most places were full at 5pm. Ended up eating at a Thai place connected to the arena. Good food.  From a layout standpoint, that arena is the best of the new buildings in the O that I've been to."
