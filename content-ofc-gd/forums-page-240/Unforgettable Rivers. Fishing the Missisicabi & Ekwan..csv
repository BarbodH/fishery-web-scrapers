Hard to believe they care even up there  It is the only place I have ever experienced that, and it happened twice.. that's two trips.  Can't explain.  Probably the best numbers walleye fishery I've ever fished. Those eyes just liked the mono better."
851286,Tim Mills,2014-05-01 01:04:00,476,Thx for posting. AN interesting glimpse into the real North.  You don't realize how massive those canoes are until you see a picture like the one at the end of report 2. Enjoyed seeing the pictures of your camps as well.
851287,Tomcat,2014-05-01 01:04:00,395,"Great story telling with great pics along too. Like a really good book, had to keep reading until the end. I'm very envious of your experiences. Thanks for sharing."

851303,Gallie,2014-05-01 01:53:00,1215,"You lead a charmed life sir, your stories make me feel like any excuse for not moving to better fishing is feeble and weak. I take what you say as inspiration to better myself as a fisherman and make my fishing goals happen. Thank you"

(dude, dude)  Only a few years now the greys have been popping up in the beard but, still good to go... Good times in the north.  Chris... a decade worth of those stories, so many people's personal accounts of life in and connected to the bush... it doesn't grow old hearing more.  Big thanks... and bigger canoes.    Yes."
