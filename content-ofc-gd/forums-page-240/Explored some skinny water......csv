My buddy Paul and I hit up a creek that is popular with hikers etc.. And is rarely fished to be honest, here in Brighton most are retired, it is a sleepy community with a huge elderly base....  We were the only two fishing in the 2 kms we walked with zero sign of any one else having been there...  We saw all kinds of steelies running, however the creek was fast, and the rain was coming down hard. Here are some vids I took (sorry about the quality.... Photobucket compressed them.....)                Now before anyone complains.... The spot were are at is not secret... And to be honest if you can find it you should fish it! But I doubt if it was under your nose would have zero clue.. That's the only reason I am posting it here...   Too add anyone know what this animal is? I was thinking coon..... But without the fur I couldn't tell...      Another ditch to follow tomorrow  G"

The name of the creek escapes me but if it's the same creek it used to have brookies and browns..  That was years ago but the memories are still etched in my mind..  Nice creek though..  Betcha it's got some troots in 'er!
