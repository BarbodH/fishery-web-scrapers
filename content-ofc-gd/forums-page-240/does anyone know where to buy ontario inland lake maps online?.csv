851320,bayofquintecharters,2014-05-01 03:38:00,9,Do you have a smart phone?  Have you tried the Navionics mobile app?  You can also view all the Canadian maps for free on www.navionics.com. But the mobile app is the way to go if you can.  What lakes are you looking for?  Scott
851336,Old Ironmaker,2014-05-01 10:31:00,8243,We used to get all our maps from The Canadian Center for Inland Waters. They are located at the lift bridge below the Burlington Skyway bridge. They weren't free. If they don't have the map it most likely doesn't exist.

Lorne's maps are good with only one drawback. They're laminated so it's next to impossible to mark them. If that's something you want to do ask him and he'll send you just the paper map."
