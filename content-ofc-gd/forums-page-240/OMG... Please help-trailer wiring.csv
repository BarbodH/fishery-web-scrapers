851726,mike rousseau,2014-05-03 16:39:00,4661,Ok  So one of my wires broke at the plug...  So I go to Canadian tire to get a new one... No biggy...  But mine was 5 wire 4 prong...  All I could find was 4 wire 4 prong...  My trailer DOES NOT have breaks...  The trailer has White Yellow Green 2x brown  I'm getting all my signals from the truck...  But every combination I've tried hasn't given me proper functions... Left-right-running-brake...  I have figured out how to get either running lights (every bulb lights up) with nothing else...  Or signal (all 3bulbs on each side) with nothing else  PLEASE HELP
851731,Fisherman,2014-05-03 16:47:00,7201,"Not telling anyone how to wire a trailer, everyone has their tried and true means. Run dedicated white grounds to each fixture,  one from the front tof the trailer to each light mount or ground stud. That will solve your lousy ground problems forever.  The double brown,  one runs to each side for the park lamps.  The green is right turn signal/brake looking from the rear of the trailer.  Yellow is left trailer brake/signal. http://www.etrailer.com/faq-wiring.aspx"
851739,mike rousseau,2014-05-03 17:16:00,4661,So maybe it's just a ground issue then...  Ok  I'll redo the trailer then
851745,Sinker,2014-05-03 17:26:00,8692,"What colour are the 5 wires coming off your trailer?  My trailer is also a 5 wire set up, into a 4 way plug.  If I remember right, you just attach the two browns from the trailer to the brown on the truck plug. This is just from memory, so I may be wrong.  If your 5 wire off the trailer has a blue wire, the blue is supposed to be for trailer brakes, and I believe hooks up to the reverse lights.  Something like that anyways.  S."
851747,Sinker,2014-05-03 17:31:00,8692,Just looked at mine. The yellow/brown and green/brown off the trailer are both hooked to the brown on the new 4 way plug. All the rest just match the colours.  S.
851748,mike rousseau,2014-05-03 17:37:00,4661,From the sound of things I have a ground issue....  I tried putting the 2 trailer browns to the plug brown and no go....  I'll just redo the trailer...
