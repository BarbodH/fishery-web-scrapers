851368,irishfield,2014-05-01 15:14:00,26272,"Take a clear container... mark a line with a sharpie and fill with water to that line. Now put your gasoline in the container and go away for a little while. When you come back if the ""water"" line has risen above your marked spot the fuel has ethanol in it. As simple as that and can be done right at the pump while filling your vehicle. Take the jar with you.. line marked and water in it... start to fill your car, pause for a minute to put some in the jar and then go back to filling your car. When you're done filling there will be enough time lapse."
851404,Crazy Ivan,2014-05-01 20:52:00,184,"That's good to know, thanks."
851418,irishfield,2014-05-01 22:18:00,26272,"I should add to that CI... you mark a line only about 1"" up on the jar ... and the jar should be at least 5 or 6"" high. Fill the water to the marked line and then add the fuel. If the fuel has ethanol.. then it will appear that the water has grown and the higher this ""water"" line becomes above your marked line the more % ethanol there is in the fuel."
850874,fisher,2014-04-29 13:46:00,451,"I used to have a list of the gas company's who sold ethanol free gas and which grades, but lost it.   Also, it was a few years old and not sure if it has changed since.  Anyone have an up to date list they can post?  thanks"

851033,Entropy,2014-04-30 00:11:00,747,"Just make sure you buy from a place with a dedicated pump for the e-free high test gas.  I once made the mistake of using one of those pumps where you select the grade of gas you want, I was just filling my 5L lawn mower can, but I would think that the gas lines from the pump to the nozzle would hold 2 to 3 litres of fuel.  I figure I got 3 litres of regular and only 2 litres of high test.  Hey at least the next guy got a little bit of good gas., eh.  I guess if you are filling a large can or built-in tank in a boat it wouldn't matter as much.  Entropy"
851046,nancur373,2014-04-30 02:18:00,1211,Shell V-power X2 but make sure it's a dedicated pump

851073,fisher,2014-04-30 11:46:00,451,Too funny.  Cob of corn.  You know they are marketing to boaters.  Smart move. Surprised no one else promotes that as aggressively.  As an FYI  I also read that Costco has ethanol free premium has.  But I don't have the patience to line up there - especially trailering a boat.
851075,lew,2014-04-30 11:54:00,12766,There's an Ultramar in Lakefield north of Peterboro that claims ALL their gas is ethanol free.
851078,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-30 12:13:00,184,"I don't think anyone sells completely ethanol free gas anymore. They may say they do, but I don't believe it."
851080,lew,2014-04-30 12:27:00,12766,"I didn't say it was factual, just passing on what the station owner told me LOL"
851083,BassMan11,2014-04-30 12:37:00,583,Some places do have it Lew. My father is the manager at a marina and he gets ethanol free regular gas for his pump. So i suppose it is out there is a few spots.
851084,Crazy Ivan,2014-04-30 12:39:00,184,I use Marine Stabil for the whole boating season on every fill-up. No ethanol related problems so far.
851103,farsider,2014-04-30 13:57:00,456,"If it isn't a dedicated pump, just put a few litres into the car's tank before filling the boat or can.  It should flush out what was remaining in the hose. I use it for all my small engines, quad, chainsaw, outboard, etc.  Cheers, Mark"

851159,Sinker,2014-04-30 17:57:00,8692,"I'm lucky that all the small gas stations in my area are ethanol free. Bethany, millbrook, pontypool.....all no ethanol in any of their gas. There are a few more around here as well....probably the same gas Lew gets in Lakefield.  S."
851162,ch312,2014-04-30 18:16:00,1590,Has anyone taken the time to test gas samples from these gas stations who claim their gas is ethanol free to see if they're actually telling the truth or not?  It would be helpful to have a list of gas stations who actually carry ethanol free gas and those who claim they do...
851165,BillM,2014-04-30 18:52:00,17367,Good idea.
851170,Sinker,2014-04-30 19:11:00,8692,I can tell the difference right away just by my mileage. I get well over 100km/tank more with ethano free gas. Every time.  S.
851186,irishfield,2014-04-30 20:26:00,26272,"I can tell you with certainty.. Shell on Vinden St Midland and Shell on Robert in Penetang are both ethanol free in their premium V power. Just finished checking two cans that I got this afternoon from Vinden St, for the F-in-laws airplane that runs on car gas. Now the $1.519 / litre I could have done without. $69 for 45. litres of fuel.  This is also where I fill my boat in the fall before going out Musky fishing on GBay.  Marina pump at Temagami Marine is also Premium ethanol free... can't wait to see what Andre has to charge this summer!"

851235,Kerry,2014-04-30 22:28:00,383,"Funny I fill at the Aamco on Front St in Orillia from time to time, it doesn't have ethanol free but the one on West St does? According to list vance posted no Aamco stations are listed.Shell V-power is all I use in my boat and sled. 1.50 anything is definately dear, glad I only use about 3 cans worth of gas a year in the boat.

851238,bare foot wader,2014-04-30 22:38:00,1354,Just filled up at 1.47 for ethanol gas in northern BC....  I'm the guy getting his 250L limit in jerry cans holding up the line at the first station across the AB border...1.12/L last time I did that

I'm not saying there is, just curious as to how you know for sure?  I read an article a couple years back where random gas stations were tested for ethanol content. The 10% ethanol gas sometimes had up to 15 to 25%. I'll try to find the story and post a link."
851343,Crazy Ivan,2014-05-01 12:12:00,184,Not the article I was looking for but an interesting read.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/gasoline-suppliers-overcomplying-with-ethanol-content-rules/article4197860/
