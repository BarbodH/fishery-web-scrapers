850425,mattyk,2014-04-27 11:04:00,2110,I had the chance to go shad fishing in Maryland. While i caught some small shad I was lucky enough to catch 5 striped bass. All were caught on a light action rod with 6lb test and 1/8 ounce shad dart. Excellent fight on light tackle. All the fish were released. .

851082,Hank Jr,2014-04-30 12:35:00,146,Nice fish Matt I know where you where fishing . I'm from Pa and fish down stream from you where the river empties into the Flats . The season now is all catch and release until mid May but you have a chance at some really nice fish . My son and I like to fish with Top Water lures for the Stripers . Here is one of the bigger ones my son caught a couple years ago . We use our Muskie rods for the bigger ones and cast big top water lures.
851093,Garnet,2014-04-30 13:41:00,2056,Really cool cottage industry making wooden top water plugs for Stripers. I'm looking for a ditch cruiser for my Cape Cod trip in Sept.
851145,JerMac,2014-04-30 17:12:00,37,Nice fish!
851147,jimmer,2014-04-30 17:18:00,2730,Those are some nice looking fish. It seems some of you have never tried smoked carp. I found them one of the best fish for smoking.
