851794,misfish,2014-05-03 20:42:00,29133,Seen this on another board and couldnt let a good laugh go by.     http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/us-usa-utah-turkeys-idUSBREA410UQ20140502  Are you kidding me?
851795,Crazy Ivan,2014-05-03 21:00:00,184,If it was a truck full of carrots would they want the same memorial?
851796,Roy,2014-05-03 21:19:00,13728,"Funniest line is at the very bottom of the page.  ""Thomson Reuters is the world's leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals."""
851805,grimsbylander,2014-05-03 22:10:00,3016,"I think it's quite fitting actually. The plaque could read...""For the terrified turkeys from the terrified turkeys."""
851809,big guy,2014-05-03 22:30:00,414,"Well when you think about it, a memorial sign would be a nice gesture for all the brother and sister turkeys of the ones that were killed in the accident, along with the mothers and fathers, who by the way, was delicious at Easter."
851810,iFish4real,2014-05-03 22:43:00,386,...humanity is doomed
851811,manitoubass2,2014-05-03 22:46:00,11391,To be in p3ta it must be a requirement to have a massive dose of fluoride and peroxetine
851818,bigugli,2014-05-03 23:09:00,6138,They should join the turkeys at the bottom of the lake and put us out of our misery.
851823,dhickey,2014-05-04 00:40:00,1038,Thanks I needed a good chuckle.  
851825,Rizzo,2014-05-04 00:44:00,4754,hahaha that is hilarious...but also sad. Wanting to put up a sign is a mockery to those who have actually lost a loved one on the roads.
851826,icedude,2014-05-04 00:46:00,459,If it was a truck full of carrots would they want the same memorial? You betcha Crazy !  We being growin some good carrots in the Bradford Holland Marsh  They are a fringe element to-be-sure at the P3Ta Gang   However--that carrier made a logistical transportation error big time-no need to harvest wildlife on a dang highway  Paul  Have Fun-Play Safe  Bear Wise Ontario
851827,dracokaos,2014-05-04 00:48:00,116,maybe if it plunged into a huge deep fryer....that would be worth a sign!
851840,Steelheadphycho,2014-05-04 02:34:00,470,So where was that truck taking them turkeys?  Surely not to be killed ANYWAY.............  What has become of us humans?
851841,icedude,2014-05-04 02:35:00,459,maybe if it plunged into a huge deep fryer....that would be worth a sign!  Got to admire--when a plan comes together dracokaos  If that unit collided with a beer truck ?  Well-you sign it  Kindly wear some OFC gear so we can thank you  Cheers  Paul
