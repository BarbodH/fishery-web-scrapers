851096,BITEME,2014-04-30 13:46:00,1968,Woke up Friday all fired up it has been 11 years since I took the turkry test have been on birds every year but could get none in the kill zone anyway ....... decide to use my tried and true deer tactic  walk call wait we went in in daylight(0630) because lets face it i dont go out and scout days before I just listen so walked down the road to my turn in spot couple hundred yards in squaked abit with the box listen nothing did this same routine for a couple football fields and he started to beak off . I stopped on a little plateau and sat down he would have to come up a small rise to me called him again and he went balistic I knew he was coming didnt have time for face mask or gloves he was inbound and still wailing away had the gun up blood was pounding in my ears saw his shape break the bush and his rapid advance to my position had to dump my sunglasses as the heavy breathing fogged them up. up the hill he comes and soon as his head came into my site he looked at me like what the hell and i powed him all i can say is that is what happens when you dont use your pecker to eat with. I dont know details because its not important close as i can give you ended up with a good turkey dinner for me and the old boy and enough for a good grubup of sandwhiches and the rest went into a very wild turkey soup ofor my guys at work. I will be going back up to see if i can ko another with the crossbow ........yeah happy dance the curse is broken  cheers Peter

851160,misfish,2014-04-30 18:10:00,29133,Nice Shooting.  Decided to bypass the spring hunt. Will get a tag in the fall for a small hen. I want to see if the meat is different.
851176,Oggie,2014-04-30 19:23:00,588,You know I thought about doing that as well. I'm sure they're tastier after a summer of good eating although I like them in the spring as well. It is more fun hunting in the spring. Dan O.
