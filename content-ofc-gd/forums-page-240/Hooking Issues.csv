They're small specks, roughly 6 or 7 inches, and they flip off the hook right at the surface. I've been using the smallest hook I have as I thought maybe they were just grabbing a hold of the worm but the smaller hook did nothing... any suggestions what I'm doing wrong ? I'm setting the hook like I normally would for any other fish. I probably missed about 10 fish today"
851076,bushart,2014-04-30 12:01:00,2628,Hook Sharp?  Is it barbless or barbed?
851077,Joeytier,2014-04-30 12:07:00,3990,"Use a smaller piece of worm and maybe a slightly larger hook.  I wouldn't go as small as a 12 or 14, 8 or 10 should be fine"
851079,Roy,2014-04-30 12:22:00,13728,Go easy on the Schwarzenegger hook sets.
851081,Musky or Specks,2014-04-30 12:29:00,2710,"Yep I use a size 8 egg hook and a full dew. Let them take it ,tighten down slowly pull it away from them , feel the weight , set hook."
851085,BillM,2014-04-30 13:01:00,17367,"OP, if you're releasing those fish I'd highly suggest going barbless.   Keep the pressure on and don't let them flop around on the surface, this is usually when they get off."
851090,Garnet,2014-04-30 13:32:00,2056,Do all of the above then but them on the bank NOW.
851305,Broker,2014-05-01 02:01:00,482,"Thanks guys, ill try this tomorrow on round 2. I am going barbless as I'm not keeping them."
851308,Joeytier,2014-05-01 02:19:00,3990,"But they look so pretty butterflied in a pan with a bit of butter and flour, salt, and pepper"
