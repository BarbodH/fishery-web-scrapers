850872,The Urban Fisherman,2014-04-29 13:39:00,2050,"The past several years myself and 3 other Fish-A-Thon crew members have targeted stocker bows and natural inland browns for opener.  My parents moved down this way permanently over Easter and my old man was eager to come out with  the gang.  Sure my dad and I chirped each other a little, and I was frustrated in the morning as I forgot to bring a lighter to light my annual trout opener stogie.... but the boys put up with me and we had a great time on the water.  The bite was tougher then usual this year, but we managed a handful of small browns and a few good eater rainbows with some panfish mixed in.  Now the boys always knew I was a little unstable but at the last second, as we were just about to leave I hooked into what would have easily been my biggest brown trout, and a fish of a lifetime from this body of water... only to lose it at the net.  ( My own fault as I grabbed the line just as it was coming to the net... ) I freaked out in a way that I would not appreciate from my own kids! lol  Anyways,  it was a great time Tom, Frank, Dan and Dad... that big fish will haunt me forever...  Looking forward to getting out again soon!  Tom slayed a bunch of panfish but we didn't get a picture for some reason... sorry buddy.  First open water fish of 2014   My old man's first inland brown     Rainbow on the crankbait...   Frankie  Dano   old man with his supper   supper "

That brown at the end of the morning was a truly great fish for that lake, lol, on your reaction when it came unhooked. I feel for you, man, but remember...we know where he lives. Sucks that we didn't take any pics of Tom, but, part of the problem was all of us hadn't fished ""soft-water"" for soooooo long that nobody wanted to put their rods down to take any. Looking forward to our next time out.  Great friends, laughs, peaceful spot, a herd of deer wandering past as Dan-O, and, I were fishing the one spot...it really doesn't get any better!"
