I was fortunate, and very lucky, to have the camera running when the male owl regurgitated a pellet.  I have never witnessed this in the wild so was definitely a very cool moment.  My guess is the chicks will be hatching in 3 to 4 weeks - can't wait to document it all.     (watch in 1080p HD for best quality)  Cheers,  Justin"
851268,dhickey,2014-05-01 00:11:00,1038,It would be cool to see them feeding the chicks.  Keep us posted.
851271,JustinHoffman,2014-05-01 00:19:00,482,"Definitely will, SaltyDawg...  Here is a shot of the male. Beautiful birds...     And the female on her nest...     Cheers,  Justin"
851291,Nipfisher,2014-05-01 01:20:00,2449,Did you examine the pellet?
851306,JustinHoffman,2014-05-01 02:07:00,482,"I did, Nipfisher. Fur, a jaw bone, various bones, and a partial skull. Black squirrel.  Cheers,  Justin"
851319,Joey,2014-05-01 03:28:00,9122,So cool Justin!
