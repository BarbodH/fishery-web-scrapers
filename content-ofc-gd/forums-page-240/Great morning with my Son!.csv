851122,fishnsled,2014-04-30 15:03:00,3520,Great report!  A fun day for everyone.
850280,NAW,2014-04-26 18:26:00,4022,"I don't think I can really count this morning as a skunk.  Alex was my Alarm clock this morning.  We didn't hit the banks till after 9.  And we only got to fish for 30 minutes before the rain.  Between Alex throwing his rod in the water a few times, searching for sticks to throw, and nearly going in himself once....  I only got about a dozen casts...  Still a great time!!!     He konked out for a bit.   When he woke up, we all headed in to town for the Maple Syrup festival.  We dropped $50 and got our syrup for the year.!!!  From a bush just around the corner from our house.   Alex found a car he really liked!  2014 Stingray!  The boy better get a part time job soon!     It's our first time trying syrup from this bush.  I'm sure we will love it.    Finished the day off with a big Pretzel!    Great day with the boy.  Can't wait till next year!  Here's a few shots from last years opener, so see how much this rascal has grown!!!       "
850284,kickingfrog,2014-04-26 18:48:00,8333,Fun memories even without the fish.
850286,Rod Caster,2014-04-26 18:53:00,5784,"Just came back from a maple syrup festival myself.  Looks like a perfect Saturday morning, even though the weather wasn't great."
850287,lew,2014-04-26 18:56:00,12766,Great bunch of pictures of an awesome day from the looks of things !!
850295,moxie,2014-04-26 19:48:00,1566,Remember those days. No skunk there at all. Very clever. Imprinting must be done as early and often as possible. Cheers.
850303,Gerritt,2014-04-26 20:02:00,6129,"Wish I was able to get out for a few hours today with my boy Liam, but between him wanting to go out on his Christmas present ( ATV) and his favorite team in the playoffs (Boston) and all the rain in between it was a no go.... I am planning on getting out tomorrow with morning him.  Some great pictures you got there... Memories for sure! Be sure not to lose them come his wedding night!  G"
850329,outllaw,2014-04-26 21:18:00,1232,simply super dad. thanks for the looks and memories.
850330,SmokestackLightnin,2014-04-26 21:23:00,390,"I hit sap fest this morning with my daughter.  Greenlaws/McLarens make great syrup, I  always purchased their product prior to doing my own.  It was a good crowd despite the showers and cool temps."
850335,registerfly,2014-04-26 21:55:00,198,"nothing like drool on the rod, along with pretzels and hot vettes. Best memories and better ones yet to come.  OH and of course local syrup rules"
850341,LefroyFisherman,2014-04-26 22:25:00,602,"I've got a 5 month old, cant wait to start fishing with him! nice pictures"
850445,BillM,2014-04-27 13:41:00,17367,"Nick, sounds like a great day with the boy even if the fish didn't co-operate."

850573,mattyk,2014-04-27 23:15:00,2110,Sounds like a great outing!
850576,davey buoy,2014-04-27 23:21:00,5505,He has one heck of a father!!!!wtg!!Great pics!
850587,Sinker,2014-04-28 00:17:00,8692,Your a great dad Nick!  Its not about the fish!  S.
850623,Twocoda,2014-04-28 02:50:00,4130,you have the beginning of an awesome family tradition ...if we are placing bets....ill say he will be 8 years old when he lands his first (by himself) on opener weekend
850624,Moosebunk,2014-04-28 02:51:00,3970,"Maple syrup, fishing and the wee lad, sweet sweet openers every year."
850637,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-28 06:04:00,8243,"Nick, you are blessed. Enjoy it, in 10 or so years he might not want to be seen in public with you, I doubt it though. There is one pic of the tyke where the light catches his nose just right and well,,,,,, no DNA testing to prove he's yours that's for sure.  My father did some imprinting with us when I was his age, he would take my brother and me to the hotel, he did leave the windows cracked opened a bit. At least when we visited Noni in Buffalo and the Uncles went bar hopping we were allowed inside for a Birch Beer. Ahh the good old days."
850641,wormdunker,2014-04-28 07:00:00,1711,Alex sure is a cutie!  He has great taste in cars!  Love your pix!  Thanx
850654,NAW,2014-04-28 11:57:00,4022,"I hit sap fest this morning with my daughter.  Greenlaws/McLarens make great syrup, I  always purchased their product prior to doing my own.  It was a good crowd despite the showers and cool temps. We bought Lalonde's last year and really liked it.  Tried the Greenlaw's yesterday morning on french toast.  Excellent!!  They also said I could take Alex skating on their outdoor rink next winter!  Seem like great people.   Wish I was able to get out for a few hours today with my boy Liam, but between him wanting to go out on his Christmas present ( ATV) and his favorite team in the playoffs (Boston) and all the rain in between it was a no go.... I am planning on getting out tomorrow with morning him.  Some great pictures you got there... Memories for sure! Be sure not to lose them come his wedding night!  G Lets see..  Fishing in the cold spring rain....  Or ripping on a new quad!!!  Easy call, I'd take the quad to.  How's Mom like the quad!!  I've got a 5 month old, cant wait to start fishing with him! nice pictures Alex was 8 months last year, and 20 months this year.  I'm sure by next year he will be able to cast, and reel.  I hope...  you have the beginning of an awesome family tradition ...if we are placing bets....ill say he will be 8 years old when he lands his first (by himself) on opener weekend 2 years in a row. Plan on doing it ever year.  I actual stopped turkey hunting so that I could spend more time with him.    I hope to get him out with Ryan's boy..  He will show him hows it's done!!  Nick, you are blessed. Enjoy it, in 10 or so years he might not want to be seen in public with you, I doubt it though. There is one pic of the tyke where the light catches his nose just right and well,,,,,, no DNA testing to prove he's yours that's for sure.  I'l start Turkey hunting again once that phase kicks in!  As for the nose....  It looks more like our mail man's than mine!!  But I'm OK with that..  This nose got me beat up a lot when I was kid, until I started martial arts training....   Thanks for replies guys!"
850660,limeyangler,2014-04-28 12:38:00,5204,"Great day out there Nick, awesome pictures of my next car too."
850661,Fang,2014-04-28 12:46:00,1330,"These times are special, believe me time flies by."
850673,Dave Bailey,2014-04-28 14:14:00,1641,"Never a skunk if a kid's having fun! Priceless pictures, very well done."
850863,The Urban Fisherman,2014-04-29 13:05:00,2050,I've said it before and I'll say it again - these are the reports I love the most.  I pretty much only get to fish with my kids so I love seeing other dads out there sharing their love of the sport with their little ones!  Good work old man!
850882,NAW,2014-04-29 14:05:00,4022,"I'm glad you all enjoy this pics!   I agree, there's nothing better than some time on the water with family.  Thanks for all the comments everyone!  One day Alex will be a OFC member, and be posting his own reports!!"
