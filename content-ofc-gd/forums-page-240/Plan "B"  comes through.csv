So asked my bud if he had his waders (nope Im going to get the boat out) I could see the smail on his face,that twinkle in his eye when he said that.LOL Ok,Im going for that fish I missed yesterday, not once,not twice but three times. Dont ask,I dont know how I missed 3 times.  So here I am, back at the same hole. I crawl under a few pines and settle on my knees,keeping low and out of sight. Im here for you mr. fish.  (today I called him Walter. LOL) You are mine today. It,s the perfect little pool with a lot of hanging branches. I found 4 of them yesterday.   LOL  Slip a black micro tube over my hook (learned this tip from one of my threads last year from spiel)  It pretty much looks like a hellgamite (sp) in the water.  Toss  to the top of the pool. Slowly it trickles down. Hit,hit,pull,miss. Damit I say. Toss a few more times and I get serious tug,Lift and it,s set this time. (I thought it was set before too) A couple of nice leaps ( I yell play nice now),a run to a under water tree,NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Lift a bit and he turned. WHEW. Short little battle after that and In the net he finally was.  It was a happy ending , Quick pic,and  happy release for  Walter. Theres no way I could keep a resident fish. They are so beautiful.     Like BillM said in his thread, the waters are high and cold,but I love fishing residents.  My hope was for the waters to drop so I can get the fly rod going,but it looks like more rain this week which will not help.   BTW, Thanks for that tip Spiel.        "

850517,kickingfrog,2014-04-27 18:35:00,8333,Nice brown. I stayed home. 3 out of 4 of us have colds. I may go for a walk after work this week.
850519,Musky or Specks,2014-04-27 18:48:00,2710,Nice fish. It's suprising sometimes how even a couple hours later a fish that felt steel can be inticed to strike again. Thank god fish are stupid.
850521,kickingfrog,2014-04-27 19:11:00,8333,Odds are that those other hits were whistle trout.
850522,misfish,2014-04-27 19:15:00,29133," Thanks Rob  That sucks Rob. Hope all get well soon. I,ll be getting out after work as well before the rains come..    Thanks Brad.  I walked away for a bit after getting 2 strikes yesterday and fished a good stretch of the creek and returned to have another strike and miss again. LOL  After the first strike today,I didnt know if I would of got another chance,but kept at it. Ya,they are stupid .LOL"
