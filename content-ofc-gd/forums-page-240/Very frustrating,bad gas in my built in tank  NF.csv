851194,BillM,2014-04-30 20:48:00,17367,"I'm guessing bad gas vs ethanol based gas...   I put the boat away in Dec, and had zero issues this spring, maybe had half a tank in it when it went to sleep in the garage.  I don't even think I treated the remaining before the winter either.  Ethanol is crap, but some people go way overboard on how much it will mess your stuff up.   A good guess is that his system isn't sealed properly and somehow water got in there."

Good to hear I have a johnson 150 on the Ranger 2 stroke and a pair of 318 Chryslers on the big boat. I have an aluminum 70 gal fuel cell that feeds the 318's and to keep the fuel healthy I have marine stabile, and an engine bay heater that keeps the tanks and engine warmer than 50F so condensation is less likely. My final protection is a good water separator that is clear and inline before it feeds the twins. The phase separation will show up in the fuel tank as small rust colored balls and only when agitated will it come out milky.   Art"
851290,bigbuck,2014-05-01 01:13:00,2449,"That is what sucks about our fuel these days. I put a double dose of blue stabil in my boat at the end of the year and starting in august, I put it in all the gas that goes in. That way, there is plenty in the system. Canadian tire always puts marine Stabil on special in the spring so stock up."
851377,captpierre,2014-05-01 16:56:00,2521,"I'm no chemist, but would it be safe to say that if water is in the tank, it would be at the bottom  and likely accumulates a bit every year if not drained out?  It would only be within the gas if heavily agitated?  So  we likely all have a bit at the bottom.  The older the boat, the more water.  Wouldn't be a problem until it gets into the fuel line"
851385,Big Cliff,2014-05-01 17:22:00,6899,"While fuel stabilizers help with the ethanol, they also love to absorb water. When they get saturated, the water tends to settle out (and yes, to the bottom of the tank where the fuel pickup is usually situated).  Keeping your tank full when storing your boat can help but if you are out running on a hot humid day and park your boat with all that hot humid air in the tank, where do you think all that humidity is going to go when things cool down? Well, it will condense and settle to the bottom of your tank in case you didn't think about it. 98% humidity means that most of the air in your tank is water! At this point, if you can pump the tank, that would be your best option.  Pushing it until you get it to run might work but you really haven't solved the problem and it could come back to haunt you when you least want it to."
851399,davey buoy,2014-05-01 20:17:00,5505,"Well did baby steps today,Added $30 of v power.Also talked to my local marina I deal with.Bought a new mercruiser seperator filter. What Ron says and maybe a few may know,he runs the service shop.Starting mid August if your still running your motor start filling up with ethanol free gas.That should give you a couple top ups any way ,if not even a full tank or so before storage.That is one of their biggest problems.I'm Very happy,having changed and topped up the seperator before install,she ran like a dream on the ears for 30 mins or more through the power range.Thanks all for your help.I will defineatly starting August 1st starrt switching over to ethanol free gas.Shell V power or whoever .Thanks everyone again!!."
851401,Fisherman,2014-05-01 20:25:00,7201,"I think the real answer is not to have any gas in the tank for the off season, that way there's no reson for the gas to go sour.  It may be a royal pain to drain a fixed tank, but it's easier to refill with new gas in the spring that have to go through what he did.  As for stabilizer, it may help, but it's not fool proof and I'll take that with a grain of salt.  I've seen open containers of stabil,  red or blue that looked more like Ouzo than anything that should go in an engine.  Stabilizer in no way guarantees that fuel will not separate."

Pop the line off the engine, put a syphon pump on it and start draining it into cans. If the boat is high enough you may be able to extend the fuel line and just get a syphon going and it will drain itself. You can then separate gas from water by simply using a 60 Oz booze bottle... and then pour the fuel into your vehicle as you go.  Issue becomes... how is your fuel tank positioned.. where is the outlet.. does the reserve position drain from a lower location.. all unknowns without pulling the floor up to look, otherwise you'll leave water behind."

Then give the primer bulb a few pumps (acts as the siphon) and the fuel starts flowing. the tank is pretty much dry when the fuel stops flowing.
