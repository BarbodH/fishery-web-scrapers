849695,irishfield,2014-04-23 23:02:00,26272,If you've ever wondered why the ground floor rooms at the Holiday Inn always smell a little musty...  Not good... should be about a foot shy of going over the street and into the houses on the South shore.
850190,bman32,2014-04-26 04:03:00,27, Yeah we are across the shore from the twin islands outside of nogies creek.  Our dock normally sits about 1.5-2 feet out of the water. If we had it in it would be completely submerged  by a foot.
