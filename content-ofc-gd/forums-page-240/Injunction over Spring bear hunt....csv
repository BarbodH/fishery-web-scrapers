Maybe we don't have enough voters to matter.This corner of the province is largely ignored by southern Ont. But we do have more than enough bears. The antis can do what they want in the GTA,up here,nuisance bears will dealt with in the same old way."

IE bed protecting Bass are targeted post spawn and beyond before the season opens. Why was spring chosen for the hunting season if the cubs are susceptible at that time of year?  It's illegal to harvest a sow with cubs in the spring and it's the hunters job to determine if the animal he is about to shoot is a boar or sow. From what I gather, most hunters will pass on a sow in the spring even if she doesn't have cubs with her. Cubs are usually very close to their mothers during this time as they are very young and the threat of male bears attempting to kill cubs is always present. The males will kill cubs to put the female back into estrous and stick by her until she's receptive so he can pass on his genes. The large majority of bears shot in the spring hunts are boars (males). Hunting boars in the spring will actually increase the survival rate of cubs.  How many bears would be needed to be harvested to put enough of a dent on the population of nuisance bears? A bear in a school yard or in your backyard is more than a nuisance in my opinion, that would be downright a dangerous situation. Who chose that word to describe a possible killer?  I'm not sure if there is a set number that would need to be harvested to lower numbers, but it is a fact that the number of nuisance bears being reported has increased annually since the cancellation of the spring hunt. Keep in mind that many people in bear country opt for the SSS (shoot, shovel, and shutup) method to deal with problem bears and we will never know how many are shot and buried without being reported.  Have we had any instances of a bear that has killed anyone in their backyard since 1999, or worse a child in a schoolyard in Ont?  Recorded bear attacks in Ontario since the spring bear hunt was cancelled in 1999 1 Fatal attack in 2005 8 Attacks causing serious injuries 45 Serious encounters with minor or no injuries Source: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources  Are these Black Bears more aggressive in Spring?  Yes. Sows with cubs are very protective of their young and have no issue attacking any human or animal that threatens her cubs. It's my understanding that males are also more aggressive at this time of year due to hunger, territorial disputes, and breeding.  Any incite is much appreciated for this transplanted southern Ontario citiot. I once saw a bear, on TV.  Johnny D    From a recent OOD article:  1937-1942 - Bears may be hunted at any time by residents 1942-1961 - Bears are listed as vermin and a bounty is placed on them 1961 - Bear status changed from vermin to game animal where hunters had to start buying tags 1980 - Bear specific tags introduced. before this, hunters could buy moose-bear or deer-bear combo tags 1987 - Regulations introduced prohibiting hunting bears in dens or on crown land within 400m of a dump. Illegal to shoot sow with cubs or cubs born in that year 1993-1998 - Animal rights groups start lobbying to have the spring hunt cancelled 1999 - Spring hunt is cancelled due to political reasons, not because biologists supported the idea 2003 - Nuisance bear committee is formed and they push to have the spring hunt reinstated without success 2013 - Liberal MPP introduces a bill to reintroduce the spring hunt   As you can see, it wasn't really that long ago that bears were considered vermin and the government was actually paying people to shoot them.  Trapping and relocating bears is expensive and doesn't work as the bears can easily return ""home"". Even if they do stay in their new location they'll soon be someone else's problem and will need to be trapped and relocated yet again. Hunting is proven to be the most efficient and cost effective method for controlling wildlife populations and also generates revenue for the special wildlife account and the local economy."

849773,wormdunker,2014-04-24 09:26:00,1711,As posted earlier or perhaps another outdoors board there is a solution.  Live trap the bears & deliver them to Bay & Yonge St. in Toronto.  Or drop them off in a neighborhood school yard.   I know for a fact while living in Terrace Bay On the black bears were spotted in the town subdivisions numerous times.  I also know first hand seeing bears in a rural area of Sudbury just 3 kms from the main shopping area.  While camping at a rather large truck stop north of Sudbury bears would be in the trailer park on a regular basis.  The scary part was right beside the trailer park was an ecological tour which invited tourists to follow a foot path through the bush to view the various plant life of this area.  I witnessed a mother with 2 youngsters & the family dog strolling down the same path which 2 minutes earlier was occupied by a young male bear!!  I shouted to the family - it would be best to return to your vehicle.  These tourists had no idea of the danger.  This injunction they are proposing is not the right thing to do!
849776,bigugli,2014-04-24 09:37:00,6138,"I say help the bear population migrate south into old ranges, like York region and the Golden Horseshoe, where they were eradicated. Best way to keep the surplus population of citiots in check."

I think the hunt will still be allowed because technically it's a ""Pilot Program"" so they can use that in defense.  I only wish that some of the people against the hunt could come up to my house for a week in the spring. I live at the end of a dirt road, water on my side and bush on the other. We don't have street lights and when there is no moon it gets so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face. If you forget something in the car and it's 10pm, or if you even want to go to the garage to get more cold ones, those are long walks even for me and I've grown up in the north.  I lived in Wasaga Beach for a few years, we routinely took our dogs for walks at 9-10pm, that thought wouldn't even cross my mind here.  I also lived in Thunder Bay while going to school, a buddy and I were walking home from the bar in the fall around 2am and decided to take a short cut. We were walking past a church and I look up, no further than 20ft ahead of us was a huge black bear, stood waist high (and I'm 6ft tall) at the arse end. He/she was walking the same way we were, looked back at us, I slowly grabbed my buddy and walked backwards until we were at a safe distance. Let's just say we took cabs after that.  Up here we don't look over our shoulders watching for potential muggers, we look out for other threats."
