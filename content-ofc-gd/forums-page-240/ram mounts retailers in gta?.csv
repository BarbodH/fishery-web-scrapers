851116,BFSC Kevin,2014-04-30 14:53:00,1351,Radioworld has a wide selection.  Jb fishing depot has them.  Bps has them.  Lebaron has a couple.  Sail has some.
851125,Gerritt,2014-04-30 15:27:00,6129,"I ordered mine from Alberta, can't remember the companies name though... But they were a lot cheaper then I found in stores and had a huge selection  Edit to add, I purchased mine from gpscity.ca I found them cheaper including shipping at the time. And you can buy the piece to build the mount u want"
851127,mattaw,2014-04-30 15:40:00,162,"I bought mine directly from RAM online, worked fine for me. I've also heard of gpscity.ca and apparently they're good and ship quickly."
