Has anyone ever tackled this problem to replace and recover the wood, I also have a trolling motor bracket mounted on the bow. Looking for some advice should I try to  purchase new carpet or use an alternative material?  Ken"

You decide if the pros outweigh the cons for you.  It would seem that anyone with a modest amount of skill and extra time can tackle this with few issues.  Good luck!  Cheers, Mark"

No more hooks caught!   I purchased the vinyl at Home Depot.  It's very soft, pliable & has a skid resistant texture.  Great for boats.  They sell it by the foot off a roll, located in the area where they have carpeting on the large rolls.  Downside is the glue they recommend is $45.00 / 4 litres.  I'm sure 3M spray contact cement would do the job.  I had a small area where the vinyl was starting to release from the plywood, so I used the spray.  Did the job!  Add a couple of staples to the underside for added measure."
