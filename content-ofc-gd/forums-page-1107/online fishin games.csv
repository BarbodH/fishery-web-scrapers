143606,sturgman,2007-12-18 02:14:00,249,So I purchased a new puter and was anxious to download an online fishing game to help kill the winter doldrums.. I had downloaded Rapala pro fishing but it wasnt compatible with my vista operating system. Anyone with Vista fishin online?

I really havent heard that many great things about vista, mostly compatibility issues.  One thing i didnt like about the game is that you can only catch bass ( largemouths and smallmouths ) and pike. Last fishing game i had you could catch all other sort of fish.  is rapala pro fishing any better??"

It featured the BOQ  I have played a ton of the bass ones and the latest In Fisherman one, but they all seem so boring. It takes forever OK about 10 seconds in reality to find fish then if you leave them on the ""difficult"" setting it is difficult to land them. If you use the easy setting you are pulling in small pan fish non stop.... There doesn't seem to be a happy medium. Maybe if you have been to lake depicted it is better?  I certainly wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for anything I have seen so far.  I still think the fishing games are better than the hunting games though."
