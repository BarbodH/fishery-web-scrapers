143388,kennyman,2007-12-17 15:00:00,737,That was a great report!! Thanks for sharing. Maybe when you hook up with fatherof3 (Brad) I'll be tagging along. You definetely had a great year. Nice muskie(s) and nice treble in the finger. Yikes!!!!
143462,ccmtcanada,2007-12-17 17:56:00,7971,Wow Sean...it was great meeting up with you in the spring...even though we didn't catch anything.  I've really enjoyed following your season...and you did amazingly well!  We'll have to get out and fish a few times next year...esp now that we have a boat.  BTW...one of my fav pics all year was the muskie release shot!
143472,tbayboy,2007-12-17 18:20:00,1497,Thanks Cliff.  I realized after I posted that I forgot to mention hooking up with you and Bly but I lost the only picture I had - you catching a shiner about 2 inches long.  Still goes to show that you guys  never get skunked right?   Will definitely hook up with the two of you again in the new year.
