143536,bucktail,2007-12-17 21:56:00,1857,I wonder if it has any spare car parts or other stuff in it.
143537,TennesseeGuy,2007-12-17 21:56:00,957,Global warming is giving us longer growing seasons.
143571,Mike the Pike,2007-12-18 00:08:00,3421,I wonder how many PSI it took to fill that Bass up
143573,Milty,2007-12-18 00:29:00,121,Looks like a pig with fins...lol
143603,Rizzo,2007-12-18 02:08:00,4754,"upon opening the fish they found a license plate, shopping cart, and human leg...apparently from the ""holy man"" that had his magic limb removed."
143630,OhioFisherman,2007-12-18 04:54:00,6623,LOL they feed them pumpkins and beer down there.
143657,Mahumba,2007-12-18 13:31:00,28,Here's one that was sent to me supossedly caught from Simcoe. 9.2 pounds.  Hopefully I did this right.......  Roger 
143667,danbo,2007-12-18 13:59:00,2646,"dang,why'd he kill it? Probably a 20 year old lunker.."
143669,Mahumba,2007-12-18 14:05:00,28,If it's 9.2 pounds and caught in Ont. would that not be a record of some kind? At least some sort of Canadian line class record? I would have released it with a couple of good photos but I ain't gonna knock anyone for keeping a bass like that. dang' dream fish.  Roger
143670,Terry,2007-12-18 14:08:00,14456,I can understand someone keeping a fish that big  I see people keeping 4lbers all the time and they try to tell you it's 7 or 8lbs..... but a real lunker..why not
143673,Mahumba,2007-12-18 14:14:00,28,You said it Terry! I am the weigh master of a local tournament and I see guys coming in with what they call a basket of 4 lbers only to see the smile disapear when the fish get on the scale. To a lot of people a 2.5 lb smallie is 4 pounds.  Roger
143694,OhioFisherman,2007-12-18 15:28:00,6623,"LOL seen that a lot too, 17 inch fish thought to be 5 pounds, if you fish enough tournaments and see the actual weights as they hit the scales you learn. 20 inch maybe, 17? give em a year or two.  Colors on the smallies can be weird, seen some from inland lakes here with colors sort of like that one, just not real pretty as the great lakes fish, never caught one with colors like that up north either.  I don`t know if there is or can be any cross spawning between L/M and S/M.  Caught a lot on Erie here that had one bad eye, one eye would look normal, the colors in the other looked like they ran together. Don`t know the cause, Pollution? Didn`t seem to be an injury, no scaring.  Any smallie over 6 is a nice fish, had days when 5 17 inchers would have been nice."
