143333,Dano,2007-12-17 10:30:00,719,Dont know. Did you eat it? Lol. I think its an arctic char.
143334,solopaddler,2007-12-17 10:31:00,8605,"Doesn't have the typical char vermiculations, so I'll take a wild stab and say male cutt-bow in full spawning dress."
143336,danbo,2007-12-17 10:34:00,2646,"you got it, Solo!"
143366,OhioFisherman,2007-12-17 13:43:00,6623,LOL you mean red snapper was wrong?
143430,Rich,2007-12-17 16:37:00,3927,That's a brown trout.
143458,ccmtcanada,2007-12-17 17:48:00,7971, LOL
143481,JohnF,2007-12-17 18:32:00,3494, Looks like his buddies just gave him a pink belly.  JF
143567,camillj,2007-12-17 23:39:00,1988,Thats there is one purdy fish ! And yes I would have said a cross between a Bow and a Speck ... but without the typical leading white (char-line) on the fins ... cutt-bow would be my guess too.
143575,Milty,2007-12-18 00:32:00,121,looks like a sockeye-rainbow hybrid
