The ice was about 10-12 inches thick with  4 inches of sloppy slush on top in some places.  Watch out for spider holes too, I could see some of them poking though the snow!  - James"

You can actually go back in time and see how the ice formed.  May give you a better idea of thickness  http://wintercampingforums.com/index.php?topic=30.0"
143682,kingjames_2nd,2007-12-18 14:34:00,72,"When the snow falls on the ice it forces up water through the cracks which causes the slush.  Some how the water being forced up and down through the cracks or what not can create a circular hole which then developes long lines leading away from it shaped like a spider web. They open up to about the size of a  boot.  big enough for some one to step through.  Look here for a  picture and a discription.  Scroll down to the third picture. --> http://www.myccr.com/SectionForums/viewtopic.php?t=20277  Any way,  I saw a  couple the other day and made sure to stay well away from them.  James"
