143616,Doctrt,2007-12-18 03:18:00,141,I've finally finished my latest project.  Merry Christmas to me!  
143617,huntervasili,2007-12-18 03:20:00,1604,"Yup... no doubt that will tell you if there are fish down under, now only one problem remains... how to make 'em bite! Great setup there, good luck to you"
143618,Doctrt,2007-12-18 03:20:00,141,One more pic  
143620,irishfield,2007-12-18 03:21:00,26272,Looking good !!! Got all the parts (except the required power cord) together in the shop to do the same with my 102C Lowrance... less your underwater camera that is.
143625,wallyboss,2007-12-18 03:43:00,1095,That is one cool setup.
143636,danbo,2007-12-18 09:46:00,2646,Sweet! What batteries does it use & what's the total cost to make me one?
143654,TJQ,2007-12-18 13:18:00,7806,Very nice.... lol.. the most frustrating part is watching then not bite...
143664,Smokey,2007-12-18 13:56:00,1278,Nice set up. Looks like you have it all covered in one box.  Good Luck with it.
143666,Fang,2007-12-18 13:59:00,1330,I think you've you've still got room for a satelitte radio and a couple of speakers
143705,2 tone z71,2007-12-18 16:09:00,1311,"Nice work Tim bringing that to Witch Bay, U in ????"
143708,bigbuck,2007-12-18 16:26:00,2449,Witch Bay??? That the Witch Bay on LOTW????
143725,2 tone z71,2007-12-18 17:29:00,1311,Big buck yeah where planning a trip next summer
143771,camillj,2007-12-18 20:31:00,1988,Very nice .... now ... since you have all winter to figure it out ... for the challenge .... reverse the fin so you can watch your lure while trolling at depth .... I tried it by using a release from the camera to the line just above the lure but the key is to get the camera to run backwards without too much to-and-fro so you dont get sea-sick watching it
143884,Doctrt,2007-12-19 03:44:00,141,"Not sure about LOTW yet Darrell, but we'll likely be up your way soon enough.  How's the ice so far? T"
143887,2 tone z71,2007-12-19 04:41:00,1311,Tim its all good theres 4 huts out there as of today
143921,Corey,2007-12-19 13:22:00,355,that's a mighty small boat for all them electronics... where's the motor?
143974,wuchikubo,2007-12-19 17:33:00,1114,Looks like someone got the ice fishing itch! LOL  BTW what's the cable length on that unit? Could it be made with 100' or more?
143977,Doctrt,2007-12-19 18:10:00,141,"The camera has 50m (150 ft) of cable, a colour lens and 21 led lights.  Should be just perfect for Simcoe whities!"
144025,irishfield,2007-12-19 22:03:00,26272,Not to entice a riot...but could that be considered using a light to attract fish ?
144042,Terry,2007-12-19 22:31:00,14456,"so what kind of camera, what lux ,what monitor did you use?????"
