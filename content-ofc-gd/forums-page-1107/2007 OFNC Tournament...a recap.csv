Our Teams pitfall was we have nobody that fishes for them course fish I guess...
141477,BFSC Kevin,2007-12-11 01:14:00,1351,"well, i meant instead of being 17-18meg files, i'm thinking they would've shrunk to a couple megs only each, just better for the people that have the slower service..... but i was fine.."
