142889,Photoz,2007-12-15 21:48:00,792,NUTS!! They don't send ANY through my Post Office that I can browse through . . . .     should I break down & buy one?
142892,irishfield,2007-12-15 21:49:00,26272,Na... get a route change Steve!
143650,Pete Maina,2007-12-18 13:11:00,213,"Hey congrats Gerritt  I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Please let us know.  Ha ha ... Photoz ... well, not sure what to tell you there. I guess I'd need to know your priorities, as we are all different. Does your wife or girlfriend fish ... if so, possibly she'd forgoe a dozen roses for a two year subscription if you promise to share with her. Of course cutting into beer money is a far more serious issue, tee hee.   Best wishes all.  Pete"
143665,Whopper,2007-12-18 13:57:00,2174,"Congrats Gerritt  You'll really like the mag, a lot of good info and most importantly fish porn to the max. I really enjoy getting mine and usually there is at least a couple OFC'ers in each issue.  Cheers!"
