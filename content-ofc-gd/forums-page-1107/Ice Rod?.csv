144095,huntervasili,2007-12-20 02:03:00,1604,Well I stumbled across this and figured someone may be able to benefit from it... Its a good general guideline for those starting out. Hope you can read it... Feel free to add what you have used and like or dislike... 
144098,sonny,2007-12-20 02:09:00,511,I was impressed with the bob izumi series that i believe ht is making....
144116,johnnyb,2007-12-20 04:37:00,3413,best ice rod I own is a nice little steel one that I picked up from LeBaron a few years ago...looks like a car antenna with 3 guides on it...nice and stiff and perfect for Lakers.  Probably a touch heavy for walleye/perch though.....
144117,Grimace,2007-12-20 04:51:00,2020,I like the St Croix ice rods.
144118,danc,2007-12-20 05:09:00,4677,A Willow branch plucked from the roadside can't be beat.  The price is right too.
144123,trapshooter,2007-12-20 07:16:00,1234,"  I agree.  I decided that there is no reason I should fish with lesser quality equipment in the winter then I do in the summer.  When I'm jigging walleye on the soft water I like a nice quality graphite jigging stick to feel the sometimes subtle hits.   No difference in the winter... sometimes they hit light and I want a sensitive rod.   Same goes for reels.... I lost a monster fish last winter because of one of those cheap ice fishing reels I bought with a combo.  Cheap drag and low line capacity, I got spooled.  Made me think... why do I use good equipment in the summer and 'cheap' ice gear in the winter??  No matter if it's hard or soft water I want the best advantages I can get so I use higher end equipment.  No reason your stradic from the summer can't go ice fishing with you.  I do double duty (winter and summer) with a few of my reels.  Stradic 1000 size is very verstatile.  Not too big for winter, not too small for summer.   It's a different story for set lines or tip-ups where you don't need the sensitivity and a lesser quality product will still bring the fish in.  My .02 cents.  Cheers,  Ben."
144124,Riparian,2007-12-20 07:34:00,269,The legend Elite series rod seems really expensive compared to whats out there in combo form.  But I like the idea of the spring tip. Seems to be a better design than the panfish popper spring tip.  I use a medium light premier series for perch. I like it alot better than the ultra lights Ive had before.
144125,Bojangles,2007-12-20 08:56:00,46,If you like your normal 5-6 foot ultralight rods or other specific jigging rods I don't see why it would hurt to stand 6 feet away from the hole... but this would only apply if you were fishing without a hut.
144129,Blake,2007-12-20 11:55:00,418,The new Bob Izumi Seroes HT Rods are really nice for the money and I also agree with putting a decent reel on the rod.  A 1000 Stardic is ideal bit also a 1000 Sienna would do the trick nicely.
144131,wallyboss,2007-12-20 12:23:00,1095,"I picked up a couple of YAD's rod this year and I just love the actionof those rods.  There 30"" ultralight has amazing sensitivity for those light biting gills and crappies.  Also got aYad Deadstick for walleyes and I just love the action of the light tip and lotsa of backbone."
