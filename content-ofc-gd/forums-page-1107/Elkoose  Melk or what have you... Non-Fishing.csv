143540,irishfield,2007-12-17 22:01:00,26272,Buddy in North Dakota out for a flight yesterday as he'd heard rumours of Elk travelling with the Moose... and he got proof. Not something you'll see every day. Now if they breed...whadda you get?  
143542,Terry,2007-12-17 22:04:00,14456,sounds tasty

143557,walleyejigger,2007-12-17 23:04:00,876," a tasty mutt,"
143565,troutologist,2007-12-17 23:33:00,951,"stuff like that makes you wonder what the story is behind it. why did this unusual partnership come to be? I doubt the cow would let him breed her, the elk would not appear as a fit mate for an adult cow, im hypothesizing   go into the outdoors enough and you surely see some interesting things"
