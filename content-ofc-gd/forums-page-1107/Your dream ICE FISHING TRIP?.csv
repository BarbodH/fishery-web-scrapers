143473,fishforfun,2007-12-17 18:22:00,105,I'd do it again in a heart beat! Definately a dream trip.
143520,Musky or Specks,2007-12-17 20:46:00,2710,"My dream ice fishing trip would be to do one ive already done. Seven days up at Temagami. Bunch of buddies. Seven different lakes. Caught every species available. Lakers, Whitefish, Herring, Walleye, Pike, Brook Trout and Ling. It was a new adventure everyday and was the best ice fishing trip Ive ever done."
143522,Moosebunk,2007-12-17 21:05:00,3970,"When I lived up in Attawapiskat, at freeze up, as soon as skidoos could cross the rivers and muskeg safely, people would go into Hawley Lake for a few days and catch hundreds of lake trout.  The fish caught were selectively harvested in the 5-10 lb range because that size was perfect for smoking... smaller and larger going back.  The odd pike and eye I imagine were caught too.  I'd love to make that trip with my brother-in-law Joe.  Take our Bravo's and haul sleds.  Set up the prospector and stay a few days."
143527,addict,2007-12-17 21:24:00,475,my dream ice fishing trip would envolve me flying south to fish for peacock bass where its warm like mexico.

143621,xrap,2007-12-18 03:24:00,683,"  also would be lake of the woods, haerd and seen lots of good fishing thier."
143622,huntervasili,2007-12-18 03:29:00,1604,LOTW for sure and also maybe Great Slave for monster lakers.... also would be nice to Hit Nipigon or another Speck lake... Fortunately I may be moving near Nipigon and within a few hrs drive of LOTW so my wishes may well come true
143624,kemper,2007-12-18 03:40:00,2232,"My DREAM ice fishing trip involves all the ice melting, and me happening to have a boat handy..."
143675,duber,2007-12-18 14:21:00,220,"Like others said , icefishing with moosebunk on any lake in his area would be at the top of the list.Really any lake with monster pike would be cool."
143704,DANIMAL,2007-12-18 16:06:00,215,"Monster pike or lakers up north, or muskies (where legal of course)"
143711,Hookset,2007-12-18 16:40:00,367,"We've done my dream for the last 3 years now. Lake Nip and the ""on ice bungalows""  I know there are far more exotic places to go.  But you get all 6 of us in the same bungalow, 3 guitars, a drum set made from tupperwear bowls or whatever else we can find, my mandolin (just learning) and we rock the joint lol, to our ears anyway.  Add Walleye, Pike, Herring and big Whities.  BBQ'd chickens at 3 a.m. and more booze than most liquor stores carry. Fresh Walleye for breakfast. And I can stay in bed and keep fishing - perfect for the nastier hangovers.  The smiles last for weeks afterwards.  I'm pretty sure it's considered my dream location more for the friends and good times than it is for the fishing. I swing back the other way when the ice melts....to a point...   Hookset."
