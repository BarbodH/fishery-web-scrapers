143585,holdfast,2007-12-18 01:00:00,1813,I was bored this weekend as there was a Gag order on me so I decided to tinker around and Built this Portable Fire Pit made from a Washing Machine Barrel and its internal stand that only cost me three nuts and bolts.  Use it without the stand and you can carry it in your trailer or trunk.  The Rinse holes work great for heat and oxygenating the fire.
