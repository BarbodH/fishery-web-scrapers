143718,yellowboat,2007-12-18 17:11:00,211,There is a bait shop in Madoc on the east side in a house ( detached garage) kinda hard to see.  There is also one in Bancroft in the north end on the east side as well.  If your going across 7 there is one on the south side east of Marmora (Chris's).
143799,Beans,2007-12-18 22:27:00,3339,If you're going across the 401 to 62...why not drop down into Belleville and look up Sam of Carra Sports...  I believe I saw a map to his place around the time of the Quinte G2G...or PM him...
143893,Garry2Rs,2007-12-19 07:06:00,1425,Stone's Bait on Hwy #28 near Alpsey might be an option.  Hwy. #28 crosses #62 in Bancroft and there's also the 620 out of Apsley if you aren't going as far north as Bancroft.
