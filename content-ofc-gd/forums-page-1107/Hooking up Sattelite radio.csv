143780,huntervasili,2007-12-18 21:19:00,1604,"Okay so I have an XM Satellite radio and was wondering if anyone had any tips as to how to hook it up to a battery... Just want to be able to bring it on the water and in the ice hut with me sometimes. So if anyone has any idea how to do it fire away in here as I will be trying to do it sometime, hopefully soon. Thanks in advance for any help  Bill"
143811,Fisherman,2007-12-18 23:19:00,7201,"What's the box look like, something like an AM/FM radio from a car?  If so you can get ""project boxes that would hold the receiver and a couple of speakers and a small rechargeable battery with a ""Y"" connector to also plug it into a 12V cigarette lighter/power source on the boat.  Red or positive wire gets the fuse, theother to negative.  Sometimes there's 2 positive, one is main power, the other is memory, they can be tagged together.  I don't know how good the reception will be in the hut, is there an antenna that needs clear sky view?"
143816,jjcanoe,2007-12-18 23:39:00,744,You'll need 12 volts so the easiest thing would be to pick up one of those emergency power packs They are also handy to have if you car won't start after a long day on the ice This is all assuming that you have a car lighter adapter for your radio  jjcanoe
143855,huntervasili,2007-12-19 01:33:00,1604,Thanks for the help...I have the instructions I need to hopefully successfully accomplish my task Thanks!
143889,charlied,2007-12-19 05:08:00,584,don't they have a boom box for that model...I have sirius and have a boombox...if you had one you could hook it up to a battery pack with and outlet on it.
143998,huntervasili,2007-12-19 20:24:00,1604,I will check that out... They must have something Thanks
144016,fishing n autograph,2007-12-19 21:42:00,2540,"xm and sirius are pretty much the same. Besides both providers will be joining forces shortly.....  Yes, XM does come with a home version and can hook up to any radio and comes with an AC plug which you can pop into one of those portable power sources"
144026,huntervasili,2007-12-19 22:04:00,1604,"i have some smaller 12V batteries I am going to hook it up to, so its portable"
144033,steelhedrmatt,2007-12-19 22:22:00,278,Make sure you dont cut the lighter plug and hook directly to a battery. The lighter plug steps down the voltage to 5.2 volts I think. (could be 5.7) hope this helps
144036,irishfield,2007-12-19 22:24:00,26272,Good advise shm... I guess they're like most cell phones.. 5.7 volts
144037,huntervasili,2007-12-19 22:27:00,1604,"yup... Was told to get a fuse, which should do the trick to make sure it doesnt explode or the like lol"
144040,irishfield,2007-12-19 22:28:00,26272,Fuse ain't gonna help you if it's input is supposed to be 5.7 volts and not 12 !!
144064,huntervasili,2007-12-19 23:22:00,1604,"apparently it works okay, I have heard one going with just an inline fuse and the cord cut... cant complain with that"
