143524,irishfield,2007-12-17 21:15:00,26272,Well there's another pic saved today...for future use ! LOL
143602,tjsa,2007-12-18 02:06:00,1578,"You and Paul scored a Yami!!!!!!!!!!  Great find. Get a couple of helmets, NOW!!  I own the previous version of that sled, it is ballistic. And so is that one. Just check the oil level in the chaincase, and the oil level for the injection, and check the sliders and front ski runners for wear. And..........fill it up with gasoline when it needs it. Other than that, giv'er. I NEVER, EVER, see those sleds up for sale up here. The people who buy them own them for life, or sell them privately to their best buds.  You scored big time. My bud owns one, wish I did. My earlier model of that sled does not have the suspension or articulated track that machine has. AND.............that sled will tow anything. Its not a speed demon, will go about 70 km/hr in a straight line on a packed surface, but for pulling power, not many out there that can best it."
143627,Joey,2007-12-18 03:59:00,9122,"Ya, we scored big for sure.  It came with a trailer, cover and one full face helmet with slider.  Can't wait to get out there now.  Joey"
