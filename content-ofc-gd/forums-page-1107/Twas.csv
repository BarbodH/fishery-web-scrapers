143553,misfish,2007-12-17 22:57:00,29133,"But the price of those baits made me cringe with all my might,I threw tubes,that made me feel the pull of a smallies bite."
143556,walleyejigger,2007-12-17 23:00:00,876,"but near the boat there was a splash, oh my with a pike the smallie did clash"
143561,Tybo,2007-12-17 23:23:00,1373,"The pike was victorious and seemed to not care, for now on Christmas day his cupboards wouldn't be bare,  Smallies for breakfast the baby pike sang, as they sat by the fire where their stockings did hang."

143601,pigeonfisher,2007-12-18 02:06:00,696,"Roy called from above ""Now you children play nice"".  For soon you shall have that bounty on ice."
143626,Bernie,2007-12-18 03:46:00,3190,A fork and a knife on my plate it did clatter for walleye was about to appear on my platter.
143628,HTHM,2007-12-18 04:36:00,4082,"And then with a swirl and a shout, was placed a meal that would make any man stout"
143633,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-18 08:18:00,1183,"Slurpping and slopping, my man he did eat While I gazed at the small portion by my seat Sit woman join me in this festive of seasons Christmas morning you'll see I have my reasons So I jump out of bed so full of glee Run to the window and there he's waving at me Left on the table was a note that did say Yours is parked to the left up near the bay  I put back on my jammies    and throw on my boots Run to the bay but it's all just a hoot Grab my rods and drill out a hole, I'll catch My own walleye....you'll see, you'll see!"
143646,Joey,2007-12-18 12:48:00,9122,"Visions of sugarplums dancing for me and for you, but alas it is only TJ in a pink tutu!  We run and we fret and hide under the bed, for who knows what devious plans TJ has in his head."

143655,Terry,2007-12-18 13:18:00,14456,"with Donny gone we chowed down on the feast it was heavily spiced and gases were released we blamed it on the dog, who passed out and was shaking we looked in the oven to see what else was baking"
143663,danbo,2007-12-18 13:55:00,2646,"Cornbread & apple pie browned in the oven, while the OFC'ers started huffin' & shovin. Dang! old St.Nick better be bringin' me sumthin, I only got a rock for bein' mean last year for grumblin.."
