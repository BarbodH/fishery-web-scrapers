143814,Paulus,2007-12-18 23:23:00,522," Also, the Grand River flows through Lansing. Here is a really cool little write-up on the Grand River.  http://www.flyanglersonline.com/features/greatrivers/grand  I don't know why, but when you click on the link the flyanglersonline server will tell you ""looks like that one got away""... All you need to do is delete the slash after ""grand"" in the address bar, then hit enter. I have no idea why it's doing that.  Close to Grand Rapids, which is closer than the Manistee, the Rogue River flows into the Grand. Here is a link with details.  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing..._06_Rockford_MI  The Manistee is a fabled river, though, and worth the drive. But these links provide you with destinations that are a lot closer to where you'll be (or are).    p.-"

143845,douG,2007-12-19 01:08:00,2693,Solopaddler is another one who might consider publishing reports along with those gorgeous photographs.  There is certainly a market for that kinda fish pRon.
