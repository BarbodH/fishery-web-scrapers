143539,aplumma,2007-12-17 21:59:00,6896,I am proud to say that A few good friends of mine that share the same passion for fishing have started a new website here in the States. It is a place that they have started and it deals with mostly cat fishing on the big rivers across the nation. In the process of designing the webpage they included a link to get to OFC to hopefully bring people from both sides of the border together and learn about the local variety of fishin that is available to all of us. If you are curious and want to see some big Cats here is the place to go. As the cat fishermen show up lets see if we can get them to come up north and catch a few fish with teeth.  link to catfishnation  Art
