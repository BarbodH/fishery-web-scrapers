His name is Brian. 66 ADVANCE RD ETOBICOKE, ON  M8Z2T7 CANADA Phone: 416-233-6838 Fax: 416-233-5339 Email: [emailÂ protected] Good Luck!"
143635,Big Cliff,2007-12-18 09:30:00,6899,"Why not just install it your self, it's quite easy. There are 4 bolts that hold the starter in and in most cases they will already be in the block, the top two are sholder bolts, you don't need to touch those, just remove the two bottom onesslip the starter up so that the slotted tabs fit under the sholder bolts, insert and tighten the two bottom bolts. Shouldn't take more that 20 minutes Max.  New starters are usually between $150.00 and $200.00 bucks. You'll need your modle number and serial number to make sure you get the right one for that machine.  As for the tune up on those units, I'm not even going to try to type out how to get at all the bushings, belts, bearing, and chains LOL."

143721,Fisherman,2007-12-18 17:17:00,7201,"If the motor has the spot for the electric starter, remove the little side plate and see if the flywheel has the toothed ring on it, if so, it's an easy install. If not, maybe not worth the effort."
143722,iceguy,2007-12-18 17:18:00,341,"I go to both places and there very good. like bigbuck said I never heard anyone  adding a starter to a machine, but your's might have the bolt hole's to attach it."
143856,PatrickGG,2007-12-19 01:33:00,562,"I will take a look at the snow blower when i go visit him this weekend if i see that a starter can be added i will make a couple of phone calls, Thanks for the help."
