There were about 8 fishermen there and I was pretty much the only guy catching fish non-stop. They were using worms and shrimp while I was using a piece of plastic the exact size of this little box [ ]. Anyways I broke my record of like 60+ pan fishes. Usually when I go there, I catch around 12-20. And today I caught my first black crappie! I didn't know there were black crappies and it was probably around 1.5 pounds. I was jigging my berkley honey worm under the barge I was standing on and BAM it just attacked my bait. Anyways it was a good fishing day. I hope everyone else had a strange day catching tons of fish, maybe due to the lunar eclipse."
108519,007,2007-08-29 02:37:00,537,Congrats Anatz on what sounds like a very successful evening's fishing.  I was thinking of heading down to Grenadier Pond one evening soon to try and add Black Crappie to this year's list of species caught.  I too was pleasantly surprised to catch quite a few Black Crappie in the pond last year in among the usual pumpkinseed and bluegill!  007

108643,Beans,2007-08-29 13:54:00,3339,"I caught my first crappie 60 some odd years ago in Grenadier Pond...someone told us it was a calicoe bass...so that is what we called them for years until I read in a magazine what the correct name was...  I recall we used to stand on a log that extended out into the water on the west side...using a willow switch, a bit of line and a hook and worm...  Nice to hear they are still in there..."
