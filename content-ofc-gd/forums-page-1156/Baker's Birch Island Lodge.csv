I have thought about this lodge for over twenty years and decided on taking a chance on it this year.  It is hard to find out anything about the fishing information in this area.  It is South of Whitefish.  Has anybody been fishing in this area or know of any reports about the fishing?  The Lodge says the rainbow trout fishing is good this time of the year, but we would like to know about the bass and muskie fishing in addition to the rainbow fishing, also.  I alway enjoy this board and reading about everybody's  fishing trips.  It seems to me as I get older the time for fishing get less and less."
