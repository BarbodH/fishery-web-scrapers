108654,mikeymikey,2007-08-29 14:17:00,376,Don't need to download and watch...  You can stream it.
108678,Anatz,2007-08-29 16:17:00,74,"I noticed Bob didn't catch anything @ Grenadier Pond. Even though he's a pro fishermen, I think it's pretty hard catching Bass for everyone else as well."
108697,highdrifter,2007-08-29 17:26:00,2534, What's a grenadier??
108703,ccmtcanada,2007-08-29 17:54:00,7971,"Interesting show!!  You are right...he kept on saying how good shore fishing is but he never caught anything.  Poor Wil Wegman too...only one fish and Bob made him look like an idiot after his ""aggressive"" hookset...LOL."
108719,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-29 18:57:00,698," The hookset was hilarious. Chalk it up to TV nerves, put me on a fishing show and the fish might fly out of the water with the hooksets I would probably pull"
108722,Hedfish,2007-08-29 19:00:00,76, This happened to me without any TV nerves
108734,ccmtcanada,2007-08-29 19:35:00,7971,"  I know what you guys are saying, and I'd probably do the same thing...what I meant was of ALL the footage they had for this show, they had to air that part??? LOL."
108744,mcallister.grant,2007-08-29 20:26:00,327,"I thought that was pretty well done. I agree with the ""over imbelished"" hookset piece. Not sure why they had to show that?"
