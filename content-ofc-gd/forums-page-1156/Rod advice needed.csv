I'm trying to decide what to pick up but I'm not sure what to get.  Right now I've got a 7' medium heavy single piece BPS extreme rod and I want to pick up one more before this weekend (I'll pick up a 3rd later - payday isn't til next week hehe).  What would you all suggest as a second rod to complement the one I have?  The 2 quantum MG classics have 50lb braid on them and my existing BPS extreme reel has 20lb power pro on it.  I'd prefer a 2 piece rod so that if I'm limited in space I can pack something easier also I want to keep the cost down a bit - say $100 tops?  So bring it on - what would you guys and gals buy in my place (target species is just about anything - hows that for narrowing it down  ).  Thanks in advance Sean"

All depends on what style of fishing you do but I would get another 7' MH 1pc, stick the quantums on the 7'ers and maybe a shorter softer M or ML 6'6"" for your BPS reel & 20# braid.  The  7' are versatile rods, you can use em for bass, pike, bottom bouncing for walleye amongst other things."

108911,tbayboy,2007-08-30 03:15:00,1497,"Thanks for the advice guys, keep it coming.  Good point Raf - better to focus on a new rod for the lighter line/reel and use the existing heavier rod for one of the new reels.  So a 6 or 6 1/2 foot medium or medium light 2 piecer is my current thinking.  The tough and bang for buck stuff is very good too - I'm lousy at taking good care of my rods so something that I won't break by sticking it into the ground climbing out of the river or other mishaps (or cheap enough that I don't care) might be a good idea"
