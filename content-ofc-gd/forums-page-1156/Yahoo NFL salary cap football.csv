108696,Puckhead,2007-08-29 17:24:00,377,"I'm in! The Salary Cap pool was great last year and a cool twist on football pools - for anyone that has played it before, you know what I mean.  Also - if anyone is interested in a free standard league system as well, we can set one up for fun - we need at least 10 guys to make it viable. I've already got 3 or 4 guys who would be in.  PM me if interested....  first come first served, 14 people max."
