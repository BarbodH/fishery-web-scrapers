108307,MJL,2007-08-28 15:21:00,2427,"This past weekend (Friday to Sunday) I went north to Algonquin Park and camped with some high school friends.  We paddled into our campsite on Canisbay lake. We had camped on this particular lake twice before and I have fished it 4-5 times in the past with good results.  I’m not much of a bass fisherman and my range of tackle for them is quite limited.  I brought with me a 7’ 3-piece Shimano Compre and a Shimano Stradic 2000 loaded with 20lb PowerPro.  The spare spool was loaded with 6lb mono.  I also brought my 8wt fly rod in the hopes of getting a few smallies on topwater poppers.  The conditions all weekend was pretty much rain. There were breaks from the rain but none seemed longer than 5 minutes. It made starting a fire difficult but we had a small stove to cook food on – We did get a fire going in the rain to roast marshmallows.  My friends didn’t believe in Gore-tex and other waterproof fabrics so they mostly stayed at the campsite during the trip. A couple of my friends did venture out for some fishing in the light rain.  My 4th cast standing on a rock 10’ from shore, I landed this one.  It hit a Berkley bungee leech.  It’s the 2nd bass I caught this year.    I paddled around the lake by myself most of the time looking for “bassy” structure - Fallen trees, logs, boulders and rock piles, etc.  My polarized glasses were also key in helping me to spot ""bassy"" spots.  I docked myself to a fallen tree.  My third cast in with the bungee leech I winched this one out before it could wrap itself around a branch.    Another one from that spot   I located 2 other spots which produced fish but none of any great size – Most of the fish caught this weekend were about 11 inches and under with 4-5 fish in the 2lb range. They were still good fun though.  Most of the fish I caught came to Berkley Bungee leeches (cut down), Storm curly-tail grubs in a brownish colour and the same Storm grubs in a smoke colour with silver flakes in it.  I couldn’t get a fish on the fly rod although I did get a few near hits on a white deceiver pattern. Overall I had a fun time fighting the smallies. My thumb is still chaffed from all the lipping."
