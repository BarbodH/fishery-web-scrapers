108532,fishindevil,2007-08-29 03:03:00,6254,Right on nice fish !!!!! awesome fight on a fly rod.  ..cool   cheers
108533,Greencoachdog,2007-08-29 03:04:00,8163,"That's a very nice Crap for a fly rod!!! What were you using, a sinking black nymph?"
108535,MJL,2007-08-29 03:09:00,2427,Great fish Crazyhook.  Carp fishing is addicting isn't it?  To catch them on the fly is crazy fun. Have you been able to get them on surface patterns?
108538,Mike the Pike,2007-08-29 03:11:00,3421, GCD thats a Carp not a Crap.
108539,Crazyhook,2007-08-29 03:12:00,1154,got that one on a Rainy's corn fly... they get fed corn alot and seem to like yellow. I have tried surface patterns and no luck yet... MJL... that was carp # 93 for me this year...
