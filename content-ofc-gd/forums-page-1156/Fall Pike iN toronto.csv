108327,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-28 16:02:00,698,"Hi All, You always hear that Pike fishing at Toronto Islands and Harbourfront are best at Ice out, my question is does the bite pick up in the fall when the baitfish come in and the water cools or does it slow down?"
108362,snag,2007-08-28 18:18:00,1932,Dunno? 
108365,Raf,2007-08-28 18:22:00,3495,for the shore bound angler the spring time is best.  fall fishing can be good however access to a boat is pretty much a neccessity as the fish (at least ones with any size) will generally not be in the shallows
108420,mcallister.grant,2007-08-28 21:34:00,327,"I do most of my fishing for big northerns in the early winter. I fish in the boat bays along the Lakeshore (Spadina and bays east of that). I have always had a lot of success. Try a Rapala Super Shad weighted with lead or giant tubes, sinking husky jerks etc. etc.."

108563,snag,2007-08-29 04:15:00,1932,"O.k.  There was this secret society of urban fisher folk. Too many to mention. (Some members like Patrick, Mike the pike, CCMT have heard of them)  There were these pike who, Dressed in something weird.  The fisher folk called them ""feed bags"".  Anyways, The story is that these pike would adorn themselves in these large, flambouyant (sp.) ""feed bags"" in the fall and parade around the Toronto waters. They loved puttin' on the feed bags. (they're so vein)  Now, Being ""urban"" pike, They liked to accessorize themselves with bling. They would go for bright spoons dropped in a stylin' fashion.  It's curious, Some pike called for raps Some called for a spinner Just don't call them late for dinner  Like Raf and Grant said, and it's good to remember, Pike spring for the shallows but Fall down deep in September  If you fish in the mountains, you may catch a goat If you fish in Toronto, you may want a boat   Hope that helped  Hope to see you out there!"
