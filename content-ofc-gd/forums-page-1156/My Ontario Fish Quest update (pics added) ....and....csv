108164,007,2007-08-28 01:32:00,537,"Hi all,  I thought I would give you a quick update on how my quest to catch as many of the fish species in Ontario this year is going.  It started off well but has recently tapered off with the only new species caught in the last 2 months being the Smallmouth Bass and the smallest Bowfin you've ever seen.  This leaves my total for the year at 16 different species.  The list of fish species so far is as follows:  Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Common Carp, Yellow Perch, White Perch, White Sucker, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Bluegill, Rock Bass, Bowfin, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner, Creek Chub, and Round Goby.  I know I'm stretching it a little by including the small fry but why not - they all count!  Apart from updating you on my quest it got me wondering how many of Ontario's fish species has everyone else caught this year so far? I know for a fact that ccmtcanada and Bly have got more than me as have many others no doubt - so tell us how many different species you've caught and what they are in this quick poll!  There are 38 species listed in Ontario's guide to eating sport fish plus plenty of others out there.  So get counting.  Who's caught the most this year?  Also any tips you can give me in order to add some more new species to the list during the next few months would be gratefully received.  Cheers 007  Here's a pic of each the species I've got so far...                                "

108183,007,2007-08-28 02:06:00,537,LOL - has to be caught on rod and line - not trapping/netting of fish!  007
108184,Musky or Specks,2007-08-28 02:10:00,2710,This is a fun thing to do and I use to have a chart on my wall when I was younger that kept track of all the data and what my PB was for each species. I did it with my son as well when he was born to see if he could catch all of ONtario's sport fish and he completed the task by the time he was 12.
108188,fishindevil,2007-08-28 02:18:00,6254,"also i caught a few goldeye,lake herring,cisco....man there is so many so little time...lol..lol"
