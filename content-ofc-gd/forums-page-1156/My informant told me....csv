108422,Beans,2007-08-28 21:42:00,3339,In P'boro over the weekend...any success?...or did the skunk that attacked me today bite you too?...  Actually I did catch sumpin' but seagulls don't count...right after that a chap up at the point tied into a duck and landed it...too bad they are not in season...mmmm...barbequed duck...especially Chinese style...
108480,Beans,2007-08-29 01:09:00,3339,So...Where's the reports?...  Keeping mum eh?...  That's OK...I heard all about how you were throwing ground bait balls and kernels of corn at the carp...  We are keeping an eye on youse guys...
108491,lazybum,2007-08-29 01:28:00,142,I also heard that four of the OFC regulars went on Monday.  Maybe they were embarrassed that they didn't do well.
108508,MJL,2007-08-29 02:10:00,2427," If it was this weekend it couldn't have been me...I was in Algonquin park.  Technically Monday doesn't constitute as part of the weekend  Perhaps Wolfville, Victor or CCMT might know something about it"
108514,Greencoachdog,2007-08-29 02:27:00,8163,"Usually when yanno people go and then don't hear much about, it means that the fishin' wasn't that good."
108516,007,2007-08-29 02:31:00,537,Could it be that the 'Carp Kings' were skunked?  What's the world coming to?
108623,Beans,2007-08-29 13:19:00,3339,Guess I had a senior moment...every day is the weekend when you are retired!  Monday it was...
