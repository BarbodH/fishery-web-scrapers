The MNR has been getting hosed for several years and needs a lot of money and effort to be rebuilt to operate effectively. Come on, CO's not having gas to patrol???"

108718,TJQ,2007-08-29 18:51:00,7806,"I do have to say... that I was totally flabbergasted with the amount of lies and broken promises the last time.. im only in my 40's but i cant ever remember being so disgusted with a party so soon after they were elected....  at the provincial level im not  party man,  but I don't see how anyone can vote for them again...  I shook hands and spoke with David Ramsay at a local restaurant and he assured me that the Liberals would do everything in their power to bring back the spring bear hunt....  then they get elected and then he even gets the MNR portfolio, and still can't do anything  about it... pathetic i say...  Ill need to see some real action on the natural resource front before I vote for him again...  maybe its too late."
108756,Fang,2007-08-29 20:46:00,1330,TJ  Being on Lake Temagami a few times each year I bump up against these Stewardship meetings with friends on the lake and by all accounts have to say what I have heard is really discouraging. Rumours abound that the ice fishing season is in real jeopardy. Funny how the biologists  can run the computer models to tell them what's going on and be so off base in their calculations but not willing to spend any time on the lake. I fill out the catch survey reports every year when at Ket-chun-eny. Hopefully they were used.
