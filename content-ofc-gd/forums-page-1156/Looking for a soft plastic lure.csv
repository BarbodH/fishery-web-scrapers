They've got about 4 aisles of nuthin but plastics, infact I grabbed some myself to attach to spinner baits for trailers."
108711,OhioFisherman,2007-08-29 18:12:00,6623,"Lew I looked at most of the bigger websites and have a good selection of catalogs. I didn`t see that color in grubs, some had them in worms and other baits. Sort of a second hand search, well third hand, I am doing it for a friend of a friend. Not even a clue what he wants to use them for."
