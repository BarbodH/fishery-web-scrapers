When i got there, there were few fishermen already enjoying themselves.  As I was setting up my gear gentlemen near by shout~ ""FISH ON~"".   Definitely felt good to see that.  Also, there as a lot more jumping and splashing than what I've seen from Bronte Pier.  But after few hours of casting different types of lures,,, once again I did not hook into anything.  I think I am going to try few more times at the Port Credit.  and I should visit the mouth of humber river aswell,,, there's plenty of fish there too and way less fishermen.   Hope to hear some reports from you'all.  -- "

108930,mikeymikey,2007-08-30 05:56:00,376,"OK...  So after work today... I decided to visit the Credit again and hoping I'll hook into one this time.  So I arrived there little bit after 9pm and there was a lot of vehicles parked.  So I just parked my Porche and walked over to the water without my gears to see how many were fishing there.   There actually wasn't too many people so I went back to my car to get my gears and as i was walking back to the water I noticed a MNR vehicle parked on the street.   I was actually glad that MNR would visit here to check on the fishermen.  As I get near the rocks,  I see Conservation Officer had few rods on his hand and escorting about 4 people with him.  I was happy because that meant more shoulder room for fishing  Yeah so that was the exciting part of the night as I have casted for about 2 hours and once again did not hook into any fish.  Oh well... there wasn't much jumping either.  But atleast the weather was awesome~!  There is always tomorrow and fishing will only get better!  --- I've also visited the Humber River at the night of eclipse.  That was one BEAUTIFUL night with super bright moon light.  Seen several fish jumping around and such but again... no hook up.  All I know is that... if i want to get away from crowd of fishermen I'll going to the Humber.  (water is muddy flowing out from the river, so not sure what kinda lure I should use)"
