108644,Guest mistyriver1,2007-08-29 13:57:00,0,"Great report Pete.  An excellent read.  If you didn't get hail, it wasn't that bad...eh Lew"
107933,Squid,2007-08-27 15:16:00,1656,"At the beginning of the Muskie season, I had mentioned to Lew that I would dedicate my first good sized Muskie in memory of Ed. Well I began to wonder if I had jinxed myself or if Ed was holding out on me. This past weekend, the jinx was lifted.  I met Lew on Guacamole lake, which runs into Lake babaganuche at 9.30. After a quick chat we headed out. The weather was beautiful!! Winds, waves and a good chance of strong rain in the afternoon, we could not have asked for a better day. Well the fish were not cooperating with us at all. After fishing for 4 hours and casting a ton of lures, we decided to go in for lunch. Weather was now starting to look really bad  Back out on the water, the clouds were black and loaded with heavy rain. We trolled for a bit and cast some more and finally, Lew nails and monster fish. Had to be 50lbs, all 36 inches of it   Quick release and of she swam for more development, see you in 5 yrs!!   Seeing bald eagles, Osprey and loons through the day was a nice treat too. After about ten minutes of Lews' release, I hit a snot rocket maniac muskie, 26 inches of terrorist fish!! Quick release in the water and it was back for more bulking up. I say to Lew, now let's go find their mother  Another hour goes by, the weather is menacing, the waves are building and we are still hunting. Then all of a sudden, the clouds erupt with torrential rain!!  I mention to Lew that this has to turn the muskies on. On go the rain suits and we start casting hard!!  Seconds later, a monster comes out of the water takes my spinner bait and decides to swim away with it. NO WAY I say, and give a good old tug. All hell breaks loose and after a short battle, she is in the net and resting. After a quick measurement and a few photos she is back in the water to fight another day. Well after that we could smell Diane's Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding cooking from the water so we called it a day and went home happy and hungry. Great day on the water fishing with a great man and closing it out with an awesome meal of roast beef mashies, gray and green beans. Oh I forgot to mention that Diane's Yorshire pudding is the best in the world. Thanks for the great Day Mr and Mrs Knighton, we will do it again soon.  This one is for you ED!! God bless  Resting the muskie after the catch   Here she is, 46 inches !!      Enjoy!!  "
