108796,Handlebarz,2007-08-29 22:22:00,3790,Hey all I was wondering how many use braid for ice line I was thinking of switching this year for a change when jigine for pickeral how does it act in the cold water will it stay limp enough to jig effictly? I will also be using a floro leader with it.
108800,Dondorfish,2007-08-29 22:34:00,1000,tried it once last year - not good - frooze up quickly. I changed back to mono but I was thinking about trying it again this year in the hut - might be better in the warm hut.   Don   P.S. (as i was told) - Its way to early to be talking about this - LOL
108801,Riparian,2007-08-29 22:34:00,269,I love braided line for ice fishing. Its all I use along with a leader of some kind to match the species im after.  No stretch. Thats what its all about.
108802,Riparian,2007-08-29 22:36:00,269, I have been told that using a reel with a non metal spool will help with this problem... Or a heated hut is good too.
108805,Dondorfish,2007-08-29 22:43:00,1000,  Thanks - I'll try the heated hut! LOL  Don
108831,Muskieman,2007-08-29 23:52:00,2472,"I do ALOT of ice fishin' I tried it a few years ago..lines like Gorilla Braid ..Spider Wire.. freeze up real quick, but last year I tried Sufix.. micro braid... awesome!!  works great on a jiggin' rod...DO NOT put it on a dead line in this case No Stretch is'nt the best. If you decide to go back to mono I suggest .. berkley's  ZUB ZERO.. Good Luck on the hard water."
108845,Smokey,2007-08-30 00:15:00,1278,"I tryed the braided a few years back but found it froze up and got stiff, so I switched back to the mono. Might be that it was really cold and I didn't give it a chance but I've had great luck with mono over the years so sticking with it."
108926,Sinker,2007-08-30 04:25:00,8692,I tried the braid last year for the first time. I didnt like how much it froze up on the reel. A plastic spool may help with that though....it was a real PITA getting the line back down when its frozen on the spool. The sensitivity was great though.  I use straight floro.....P-line.....usually 8lb for deep water and 4lb for panfish.  Sinker
108927,babaganoush,2007-08-30 04:51:00,105,"all i use when jigging for lakers, whities and walleyes is fireline ice crystal and will never go back to the mono.....never  had a problem with my line icing up....just stay away from the power pro ice line as it seems it absorbs water and freezes up like mentioned above"
108929,Sinker,2007-08-30 05:03:00,8692,I was using PP.
108968,RHYBAK,2007-08-30 12:39:00,21,I tried the 4 pound Crysatl for perch and had no problems.
108969,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-30 12:41:00,2585,good thing we are still a few months away from the hard water.  im not ready for cold just yet.  CHeers!
108997,Uncle Buck,2007-08-30 13:27:00,1000,"i used 30lb PP with a 10lb flouro leader in the hut... it has it's pros and cons...  perch and panfish, just stick with mono..."
109002,Raf,2007-08-30 13:33:00,3495,I like braid for a lot of things just not ice fishn for the reasons mentioned.  Maybe if I was a hut dweller it'd be a differnet story.
