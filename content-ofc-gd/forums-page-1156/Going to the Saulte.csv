108237,danbouck,2007-08-28 11:17:00,4380,Take the drive north to Lake Superior park. An amazing drive!
108249,yellowboat,2007-08-28 12:15:00,211,If your going to the Sault go fishing behind the mall.
108282,Craig,2007-08-28 14:05:00,33,"Just like Yellowboat said.  Behind the Station Mall. They're catching Chinooks, Atlantics and Pickeral there right now. Pinks will just be starting. Anywhere in behind the mall or in front of the Holiday Inn. I've seen sturgeon in there too. Lots of options!  Welcome to the Soo!"
108335,Dozer,2007-08-28 16:26:00,896,"Oh oh, any update on the pinks? My father once told me a few fishing stories from up there, sounds intense!  Pinks come in this long weekend he says... any input on that?"
108337,Craig,2007-08-28 16:32:00,33,"Yep, the Pinks usually start this weekend. I'll be out there!"
108352,Bob Devine,2007-08-28 17:27:00,251,"The St. Mary's River is gorgeous. I enjoyed the fishing while touring on the MWT, it was one of the best stops on the trail a few yrs back. To watch a 1000 footer navigate the river is cool an the locks are impressive too. I believe it is a 2' drop from Superior to the river. Although the fall colours are not in high gear the Algoma Train ride is a nice day trip. If you happen to get on the river check the US side at the power plant, the brickwork has small lighthouses created in the work. "
108353,yellowboat,2007-08-28 17:31:00,211,Bob it 25 foot drop or so
108413,taper,2007-08-28 21:20:00,611,"Thanks for the help guys, I think I am staying at the Holiday inn. What type of tackle and bait are they using there and at the mall. Bob thanks I will check out the Algoma train as well. I don't know how much time I have but I will fit in what I can. Do they night fish in the spots mentioned?"
108417,Zib,2007-08-28 21:24:00,369,Here's a live fish cam of the St. Mary's on the Michigan side.  http://www.lssu.edu/arl/fishcam.php
108588,yellowboat,2007-08-29 11:26:00,211,"Night is the best time to go out, you could also try the first lock peir on the Canadian side or fish the shore down stream of the power station Be carefull."
108712,Lefty,2007-08-29 18:15:00,14,"If you're after pinks, an all time favorite in the St. Mary's has been Pixies in green or pink. Cleos can also be effective. Stop by Western Automotive (its not far from the Holiday Inn but its on Queen St.) and talk to Orest. He'll set you up. He always has a pretty good selection and is always up to date with the fishing reports in the area.  Have Fun!  L."
108759,Dara,2007-08-29 20:50:00,3052,"If you do any rainbow fishing, hit the rapids Be care full tho, can be a dangerous spot, and you will need waders.  After midnight the pier on the far side of the power canal can get you some good pickerell. Black and silver rapala is always a good bet. Anywhere for pinks. Nice waterfront to just wander around on too. Even if you aren't fishing, the rapids is a nice walk. As was said earlier, Take a drive up along Superior for an hour or 2. The scenery can't be beat"
