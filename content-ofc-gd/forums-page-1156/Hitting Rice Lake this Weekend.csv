108793,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-29 22:19:00,698,So my trip to Scugog last weekend never materialized due to some hangovers (not mine). This weekend I am taking my Fiancee out to Elmhirst on Rice Lake. She is all geared up for fishing and I hope that enthusiasm continues! I'll probably be jigging and pigging the weeds and running the spinner baits along the weedbeds for some bucketmouths. I'll have a full report with Pics (hopefully with fish) on Tuesday. Anyone know of any other good tactics for Bass or Walleye on Rice at this time of year?
108799,Green,2007-08-29 22:31:00,20,We were at Rice for 3 days last weekend. We did well with green Jig with pigs fishing very slowly in and around Sugar Bush Island. One of us even caught a Musky on the jig and pig. For small mouth we did well with ribbed tube jigs around grasshopper and margaret island.  Good luck. the weather looks like it will be really nice.
108891,sharper,2007-08-30 02:22:00,279,Hey Toronto Angler I was just there with no luck. An OPP boat stopped us and even said rice lake was a hit and miss sometimes anyways wishing you luck. By the way where is that cliff in your avatar???
108907,sunfish,2007-08-30 03:08:00,57,was just there over the weekend.   Usual spots didn't produce like they normally do.  Had tons of luck by docks.  Try throwing some senkos...good luck!
108908,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-30 03:10:00,698,Thanks for the tips guys.  BTW the cliff is in Negril Jamaica
