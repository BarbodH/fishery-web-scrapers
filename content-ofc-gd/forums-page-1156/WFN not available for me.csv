108731,Hooked,2007-08-29 19:30:00,891,"I can't believe it, I ordered television through Cogeco and asked for the Theme Pack with WFN, wouldn't ya know it, its not available here!!  Its not like I live in the boonys, btw, I live in Stoney Creek.  I recall someone having this issue before, think it was TJ, did you end up getting it?  I just want to find a way to persuade Cogeco to make it available, any ideas?"
108732,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-29 19:31:00,698,You could always get Bell Expressvu as I think it's available in there.
108733,tonyb,2007-08-29 19:35:00,1637,"Did you order Digital Cable? I think it is only available on digital cable, not the classic analogue cable.  Starchoice and Express-VU offer it now I believe.  Or FTA..."
108781,motv8tr,2007-08-29 21:46:00,2587,I have Express Vu and they said I need a second dish if I want WFN...I'm too cheap   a fellow OFC'r offered one to me but i haven't gotten in touch with him yet...but I will  Maureen
108788,danbouck,2007-08-29 22:08:00,4380,I had to have a special dish and HD for express vu to work. Had starchoice and it did not have OFC
108789,Corey,2007-08-29 22:08:00,355,"It's actually WFN that decides where its viewing area is going to be. I have been asking about it for a year now and all they did was send me a lousy box of swag... well ok it wasn't lousy, it had lots of swag though, both WFN and the Fight Network...  I am still groaning to Cogeco about when the phone service will be available in Smithville... 10 minutes from SC."
108917,JPD,2007-08-30 03:39:00,296,"Corey, just to give you a heads up, the cable providers make all of the decisions whether or not to carry a station, believe me that there isn't a station out there that wouldn't want to be in an area  WFN has been added to every major digital provider from coast to coast and hopefully will become more readily available in the more remote or smaller areas.  JP"
108921,bigfish1965,2007-08-30 04:03:00,3382,"Still not available in Fonthill, either, Corey. Who do i gripe to to get some swag???"
108939,Corey,2007-08-30 10:22:00,355,"I filled out comment forms on both the cogeco and wfn website, almost begging for it to be available in my area. I told them I wanted to give them my money."
108967,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-30 12:39:00,2585,star choice has wfn i watch it all the time.  Cogeco digital in oakville carries it.  I watch it when im at my parents place.
108984,Weeds,2007-08-30 13:06:00,782,Last I checked you needed a second dish for it in the Peterborough area too and that's with Bell Express Vu.
108995,Uncle Buck,2007-08-30 13:25:00,1000,"We've got digital cable, and i live 2 minutes from ted/hooked and i can't get it either...  it's not available in the area???"
109043,Mike Pike,2007-08-30 14:48:00,1332,The CRAP stations that Cogeco DOES offer to us in Hamilton is mind-blowing!  Never hard to find a dog show!!!  Guess they figure Hamiltonians don't fish..
