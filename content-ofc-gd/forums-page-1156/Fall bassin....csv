Although I usually do quite well on the lake ive never fished it outside of july and dont really know what to expect, are the fish going to be holding in the same general areas or will I have to switch it up a bit?  Any tips on fall bassin would be greatly appreciated."
108529,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-29 02:59:00,698,It's been quite hot so I think the summer pattern is going to hold for awhile. The usual weedbeds/structures are good bets. Jig and Pig the slop or heavy weeedcover should produce some good bass.
108531,Greencoachdog,2007-08-29 03:00:00,8163,"They may be a little shallower than what you're used to, and if it's been cool... they should be hungry!!!"
108546,Whitemikeca,2007-08-29 03:21:00,138,"Kemper,  I fish upper buck a couple times a month and this time of year the big bass usually move a little deeper.  I generally fish in the shallow, weedy bays(less than 5 feet of water) for most of the summer but this time of year all I catch there are a few 1 pounders.  A pattern that might work for you would be to find deep weed lines and slow fish with a senko or jerkbait.  I also like a spinnerbait around islands and shoals in deeper water areas(west of Nichol Island).  Good luck!"
108560,kemper,2007-08-29 04:11:00,2232,"Thanks for the quick responses guys, and that area west of Nichol island has produced for me many times during the summer so maybe I will find them in some of the same spots."
