We rented a pontoon since there was 7 of us and started the day on the southern side of Rice Lake. Right off the dock my friend dipped his line in with a worm and caught a small perch right off the bat. Off to a good start right? Once we hit open waters we used crankbaits, jigs and worms. Didn't feel a single pull. Moved the pontoon around a feel places until we hit a golden spot for panfish, caught tons of perch, huge sunfishes and some rockbass. All in all was an amazing day out on the waters with friends even if we didn't hook a single bass (our target)."

Last saturday I went to Rice Lake and it took us a long time to find the fish, but for sure they are still around, just drift around and look for weedbeds.  Here's an 18 inches Largemouth  This one was caught using jig and grub VERY SLOWLY~!  Actually all fish we caught that day were SLOW."
