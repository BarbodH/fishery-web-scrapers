The water is so cold, they do not fight like they do in October. Screaming and jumping all about. This one hit like I was caught on bottom. The yellow tip of the float slowllllyyyy went under. A lift of the rod and there was weight on the end. Was a quick sluggish battle. A fish is a fish,no matter.   "

1018730,SirCranksalot,2017-12-02 22:24:00,3291,Did you have the place all to yourself? It's been really really slow this last while!!  I haven't bothered because I see folks come and catch very little.
1018731,misfish,2017-12-02 22:43:00,29133,"Ya, . The whole morning, just me and me bye. I got that one under da tree, down from de isle bye.  Not a hippy to be seen."
1018733,Rizzo,2017-12-02 22:58:00,4754,I am impressed by the rod balancing act...if only you had two trout you could juggle them while still balancing rod...that would be a sight
1018738,Garnet,2017-12-02 23:49:00,2056,Eastern ditches are really streaky. Yesterday nothing caught by anybody till 11:30 then game on. Still fighting good no jumps but still ripping.

1018767,misfish,2017-12-03 18:09:00,29133,"And this morning, I was up the road a ways.  Not another fisherman to be seen. Nor a fish. LOL But did sit by a small fire and had coffee and listen to the woods awaken. That was so peaceful. I am seeing , more and more fish ducks on the river this year. Never seen that before."
