Was a unique year in many ways - unbelievable high water levels, a really un-summery summer with weather that did its best, and often succeeded, at confounding my attempts to plan some trips; we decided to fish new waters this year on Lake O and had a big learning curve figuring it out; watching G take the first steps out of childhood; becoming an expert at hook removal (something I would gladly have done without); yest another incredible t-storm (blew the dock I was tied to right of its moorings)  - the first year with no family vacation. Life has a way of mixing it up I guess. The vid roughly follows the season from start to finish. The pics have less to do with specific events, and more to do with when I actually remembered to take a photo - so often I am just experiencing the moment. G was obsessed with catching a 30 lber for the last half of the season, and getting a smile, even for a 20 something fish was a challenge.  	. Credit to Jean Luc Ponty for the sound track.  "

Just buckling up the boat when it was minus 2 and my fingers were on fire within 15 minutes. AInt that the truth Mike - good to see you back round here,  - looks like you had a pretty good season yourself from what I saw. Sweet boat you got there. Hope the chartering is going strong. Hey Bruce - back atcha, not many of us left ...  saw him both solo and with Zappa, and studied to many a midterm with JLP in the background.  thanks for the comments, all"
