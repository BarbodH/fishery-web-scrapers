1018725,drwxr,2017-12-02 20:27:00,453,"Not sure if any companies will be interested obtaining a patent when there are much more sophisticated jiggers out there. Lets say this one, with different jigging pattern settings.  "
1018745,lunkerbasshunter,2017-12-03 00:07:00,2585,agreed!  This one would be less cost and easier to manufacturer and ship.  I still think its impressive what the guy built though!  Cheers!
1018748,misfish,2017-12-03 00:45:00,29133,"I,ll stay with a dead stick, and jig with the other.  "
1018749,John Bacon,2017-12-03 00:51:00,3277,"Or, for your second line...  Windlass?   https://www.cabelas.ca/product/14808/ht-windlass-tip-up"
1018751,Fisherman,2017-12-03 01:00:00,7201,That's the one.
1018351,kickingfrog,2017-11-28 00:33:00,8333,Sorry if this has already been posted.  https://globalnews.ca/news/3880610/ice-fisher-makes-video-about-ice-fishing-rig-internet-cant-get-enough/
1018353,Fisherman,2017-11-28 00:54:00,7201,"A different approach, maybe something for someone with limited dexterity."
1018357,Terry,2017-11-28 01:35:00,14456,i thought a device that auto jigs was illegal in Ontario
1018358,Fisherman,2017-11-28 01:43:00,7201,"Not sure but what about those rigs they use for pike fishing that has the flag and small ""wing"" that goes up and down with the wind, wind powered jigger?"
1018363,Terry,2017-11-28 02:44:00,14456,"yup but not motorized im not even sure, just think i remember reading something about it"
1018371,Woodsman,2017-11-28 14:08:00,1286,Nothing currently in Ontario laws to prohibit this device. It's illegal to use a spring to set the hook but this doesn't use a spring to set the hook. A rod under tension is not considered a spring which some other devices use.
1018372,Woodsman,2017-11-28 14:12:00,1286,Actually some downriggers also mechcanically jig up & down. They are also legal.
1018389,AKRISONER,2017-11-28 18:52:00,5558,"boy i hope buddy got a patent before going on the news. Otherwise bass pro is already going to have an order out to china to make 10,000 of them for 10 cents a piece and will subsequently sue the guy for stealing their idea to boot."
1018390,misfish,2017-11-28 19:26:00,29133,"Something tells me, Terry has one on order already. He does like new toys. LOL  "
1018392,Headhunter,2017-11-28 19:31:00,5703,Terry's will be broken right outta the box! LOL HH 
1018396,drwxr,2017-11-28 19:43:00,453,old news  
1018402,misfish,2017-11-28 21:13:00,29133,
1018404,kickingfrog,2017-11-28 21:18:00,8333,Wrong news. Open the link.
1018406,irishfield,2017-11-28 21:45:00,26272,
1018412,Woodsman,2017-11-28 23:19:00,1286,I did and I see a jigging tip up driven by a motor. Only difference is the JJ also has a hook setting finction.
1018418,Terry,2017-11-28 23:40:00,14456,i guess the problem is can it jig without setting the hook if a mechanical device helps set the hook it would be illegal
1018419,misfish,2017-11-28 23:41:00,29133,"You need all the help you can get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I say it,s legal, if it helps ya buddy.,  Edit to add, thats a long piece of line on that one fish."
1018427,Terry,2017-11-29 00:29:00,14456,i would not want one. i was just wondering if its legal  
1018438,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-29 02:54:00,8243,You are 110% right Acree. A  million and a half hits too late. There are corporations like BP and or Cabela's  out there already that have copied it and applied for preliminary patents in the US I'm afraid to say. Money talks and great ideas given for free walk. They are probably already developing an App for the smart phone to tell you a fish is on. Too bad for the guy really.
1018441,Chuck Enwinde,2017-11-29 05:34:00,247,"People have been making auto jiggers for years.  This guy just had good timing ..... and facebook.  I saw a guy about five years ago with a pretty slick one at Quinte.   Though his certainly looked like it ""could have"" set the hook as it had a pretty swift upward jigging motion before falling back on slack line."
1018450,Woodsman,2017-11-29 13:29:00,1286,"Actually you words your looking for is ""uses a mechanical spring, other than the fishing rod under tension, to set the hook for tha angler"" would be illegal. "
1018452,oldphart,2017-11-29 13:37:00,665,"~~~I liked the Victoria Model commercial, that came up on my computor"
1018485,jimmer,2017-11-29 20:18:00,2730," Yeah, I was thinking the same thing."
1018489,grimsbylander,2017-11-29 20:51:00,3016,"The fact he posted it all over Facebook is probably a good thing if he's going to pursuit a patent. Chronologically, it openly demonstrates he held the intellectual property first. If he sells this idea to a larger business to take over, they'll have a great paper trail of ownership. It's the good ideas that get mentioned causally to the wrong people that get sniped because it becomes a he said, she said battle. Either way, he should unload it for cash and a residual % of sales and let a business with the capital to build and market it have it."
1018498,Woodsman,2017-11-29 21:43:00,1286,Getting a patent now would cost more than it's worth if even possible. Other simular products out there already.
