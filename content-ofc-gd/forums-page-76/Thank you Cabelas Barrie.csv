1018114,BillM,2017-11-22 02:11:00,17367,"Got a tip on a rod sale that was on this week and got pretty lucky.   I'm going to use this on the Niagara with big slip floats, bomb hardware with it, fish spring lakers with it, use it off the boards in Owen Sound, whatever!  lol   I'll probably toss one of my Shimano Calais on it for sh*ts and gigs    "
1018127,misfish,2017-11-22 10:48:00,29133,I said on the weekend they had them. LOL  Nice score Bill.
1018136,AKRISONER,2017-11-22 14:16:00,5558,"nice Bill, ive heard some rumours about a ton of the loomis rods being liquidated now that the conquest rods are hitting the market. 70% off is solid!!!  "
1018140,BassMan11,2017-11-22 15:08:00,583,"Yup posted this topic 2 weeks ago. 2 of those float rods left at the store in Ottawa as of Saturday last week. Cabela's here in Ottawa is going crazy. NRX's and Legend Xtreme's & Tournaments - $199 Hummbird Helix 12 Sonar GPS - 799 / Helix 10 Sonar GPS - 599 112lb Terrova's and Ultrex's 50% off Shimano Calcutta 200D - $199 As well as all sorts of other rod, reel, terminal tackle, accessories deals going on. I find myself going in there every other day to see if some other deal pops up. Picked up 2 Legend Xtreme casting rods taxes in for almost $150 less than what 1 rod would cost at regular price.  "
1018141,BillM,2017-11-22 15:20:00,17367,Wow man that's some crazy stuff!   I should have searched before starting a new topic lol!   I could use a new graph for the console
1018175,grimsbylander,2017-11-23 04:13:00,3016,Ultrex's 50% off?? whoa! I guess none of these deals are showing up online.
1018179,BassMan11,2017-11-23 12:30:00,583,"No these are all in store ""clearance"" items with that yellow tag on it. Can't find any of it online.. "
1018193,Gregoire,2017-11-23 18:51:00,1397,"Does anyone know if the Cabelas in Barrie has the Helix 1o in stock on sale? I would consider making the trip up on Saturday, but don't want to drive all the way up from Toronto to find that they don't have what I want."
1018195,BillM,2017-11-23 18:54:00,17367,Best bet would be to call the store
1018206,buick14,2017-11-23 21:30:00,741,"Nice rod casting too! Wish I lived close I woulda checked one out, probably sold by now. ive been looking for a nice baitcast float rod!"
1018207,PUMP KNOWS,2017-11-23 22:26:00,937,Nice score!
1018243,AKRISONER,2017-11-24 17:24:00,5558,"what in the heck!?  Helix 10 for 599? jeezus, although i believe it, i saw some stuff out of the states along that regard. The 9+ models of the Helix are an oddity if they dont have DI or SI...its too high end of a unit so anyone buying them wants si and di.  112lb terrova at 50% off is outrageous."
1018245,BillM,2017-11-24 19:13:00,17367,Yeah this thing will definitely be multi-use.   The idea of running 20gram slip floats on my IMX at the Niagara isn't very appealing
1018254,misfish,2017-11-24 21:59:00,29133,"Bill  You,ll be able to run 10 lb with 6 lb lead for down riggn lakers. That rod will be a blast with them on."
1018273,grimsbylander,2017-11-25 17:23:00,3016,"The Ultrex's are 60"" shafts...Arrrrrg!!!"
