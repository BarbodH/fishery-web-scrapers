1018315,Chuck Enwinde,2017-11-27 06:30:00,247,"My buddy saw this moose so he stopped his car to get out for a better look.  He watched it enter the bush and walked back to his car where a news crew was now waiting.  The reporter asked if he saw the moose and if he'd mind going on air.  He replied ""i'd rather not"" . Camera guy says ""we're rolling"" .  First question: ""Were you surprised to see a moose this far south?""  Reply: ""I guess a little"".  2nd question: ""how do you think it got here?"".  Reply: `probably wandered down the Rouge valley.` 3rd question: ""they`re vegetarians right?""  Reply: None.  except for a barely audible giggle from the camera man.  Unfortunately it looks like it didn't make the cut, I don't know, it sounded like pure gold to me."
