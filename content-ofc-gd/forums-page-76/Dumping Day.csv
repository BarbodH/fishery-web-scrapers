1018377,BITEME,2017-11-28 15:23:00,1968,Goooooog mmmoooring OFC i wrote this to the guys and girls at TOWARF and as I sent it I realized it was a fishing thing and would be good for you guys as well All is well on the east coast reall enjoying a slower pace of life and people lots of work to do on the house over the winter to make it ours As my alarm goes off at 0545 I wake to see Orion’s Belt from my window and the Erie glow of lights bobbing in a usually star filled inky black sky . Today is dumping day the start of lobstering season in district 34 in Nova Scotia . At 0600 the bobbing lights begin to move in single file a herc flies the line and it starts> Support by CCG IS OUTSTANDING. A herc 2 cormorants 3 fast boats and a couple large surface vessels will stand guard for these hearty men and boys who will toil in the cold Atlantic till spring to bring you the tasty little crawlers that are loved by many the world over> So as you are enjoying the warmth of your home and the security of flat ground give a shout out to these men and boys doing what they love and live for>> Cheers  Tight lines peter 
1018381,BITEME,2017-11-28 15:44:00,1968,That by the way is from our bedroom window
1018383,AKRISONER,2017-11-28 16:43:00,5558,the canadian coast guard is there to ensure that all of the boats move safely out of port?
1018386,BITEME,2017-11-28 17:38:00,1968,to make sure everyone is safe not to guide them out
1018387,BITEME,2017-11-28 18:03:00,1968,?
1018388,AKRISONER,2017-11-28 18:49:00,5558,they fly the herc every day keeping an eye on things for the entire fishing season?
1018410,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-28 22:29:00,8243,"What a nice thing to wake to, and what a marvellous view. I wonder about the CGG's purpose as well. When they have the 444 Walleye tourneys out here the water is covered in boats coming out of the Marina's and well over 100 at times at wide out throttle and there sure aren't any safety escorts. What does the acronym TOWARF stand for? By the way the pace down east sure is slower than a hay wagon a lane and a half wide out here. I bet you miss driving the 400 series highways eh der Bey fer holy jumpin Geezus?"
1018422,BITEME,2017-11-29 00:03:00,1968,Well I guess I will answer it this way there is a lot of money involved  in every way you can think of “ tourneys  that’s cute “. ? The Atlantic is powerful body of water. This fishery is in the dirtiest time of year in very cold water. CCG is a very strong force on the water and are highly skilled in this neck of the woods and in my opinion across Canada.This fishery pumps multi millions of dollars worth of business locally provincially and federally. The fisherman need to know that they are being gaurded. And really bottom line it’s what the CCG are paid to do. TOWARF  Town of  Oakville Water Air Rescue Force They  are a community owned CCGA Teir 1 rescue unit on the western end of Lake Ontario The pace is great and NO I do not miss the 400 driving  Cheers Peter 
1018423,BITEME,2017-11-29 00:09:00,1968,I forgot anyone that “knows” District 34 produces the finest cold water lobster on the planet bar none!!!!
1018426,misfish,2017-11-29 00:21:00,29133, Glad to see your enjoying the laid back life Pete. Would love to see some of the PAINTED homes in your area. Are there still those that use the long sticks to hold up the cloths line for  drying the laundry?
1018429,BITEME,2017-11-29 01:27:00,1968,See the sticks by the bourbon ... for my clothes line my house is bright yellow blue shutters white and I have a red barn
