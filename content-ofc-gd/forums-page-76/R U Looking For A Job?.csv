We are sitting on the beach reading the Miami Harald and Bruce says ""they are hiring Cops here"". A few hours latter they are measuring us for uniforms. $10,000.00 a year not including OT and green card included, no questions asked. High School grads preferred!!!! I was making 20K as a shipping clerk in the Steel Plant."
