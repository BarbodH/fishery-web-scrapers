Imagine it will wake you up when a fish is below the hole. I still have my portable B&W Eagle Ultra Fish ID. It takes 2 @ 6 volt batteries. Circa 1993. I still have it and it works too. I still have a Lowrance sonar complete with paper graph, early 80's I would guess. That would look great next to your Lowrance in your new Man Mansion Dave. I'll will it to you."
