1017823,G.mech,2017-11-17 14:33:00,830,Spending some time in Miami Beach and just had to share:           
1017825,BlueEye,2017-11-17 14:50:00,338,Wow.... I wouldn't be able to afford the gas bill just to start those up.  Pretty cool!
1017827,fishindevil,2017-11-17 15:05:00,6254,wow........so that's what it looks like to win the lottery....lol

1017833,lew,2017-11-17 16:55:00,12766,Guys that can buy all the horsepower aren't worried about the price of gas LOL
1017834,DRIFTER_016,2017-11-17 17:49:00,10439,No big racks of 7 Marine engines?
1017836,Headhunter,2017-11-17 18:01:00,5703,Some of those guys are pretty lucky that their boats aren't any wider!!!!! HH
1017837,DRIFTER_016,2017-11-17 18:06:00,10439,This is my favorite offshore center console. 53' Hydra Sports Suenos with quad 627HP 7 Marine OB's. 
1017838,LeXXington,2017-11-17 19:16:00,1928,They must be short of money not a kicker to be seen.
1017842,grimsbylander,2017-11-17 19:27:00,3016,I was thinking of doing the same kind of setup on my boat...do they make counter-rotation 25hp's?? lol
1017843,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 19:28:00,8243,"Eggxactly what I was thinking, peasants. And why don't you rub it in G.Mech. Actually it is beautiful here today, sunny and zero wind off the lake, and going up to 10 tomorrow in Simcoe, so there."
1017844,Cast-Away,2017-11-17 19:36:00,790,When size matters!
1017876,Mister G,2017-11-18 14:17:00,1429,"The things some of these companies do to ""TRY"" to catch up to the G22 E-TEC's..........."
1017881,Tom S,2017-11-18 15:11:00,362,Or how to operate their boat correctly....

1018211,G.mech,2017-11-23 23:48:00,830,It sure seems to be based on my time there...I think Miami Vice has thrown in the towel.
1018300,lunkerbasshunter,2017-11-26 20:14:00,2585,super cool but I have never caught a fish going faster then a few miles per hour so I ill pass and take a new Lund with a decent trolling motor.  But still wild to see what people will spend there money on.  Cheers!  
1018306,Canuck,2017-11-26 22:35:00,491,I guess you would have to backtroll for walleye's with this rig?  wink I am not sure they make a trolling drift bag big enough to slow it down.
1018307,misfish,2017-11-26 22:46:00,29133, Thanks for the chuckle Dave. I bye.
