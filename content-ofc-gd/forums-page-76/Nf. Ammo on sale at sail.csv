1018120,Freshtrax,2017-11-22 03:23:00,2215,Sail has ammo on sale 20% off for black Friday.   As well as most everything in the store.   Let' just say the wife was not impressed when I got home to tonight....I told her I saved a bunch of money in the future.   She wasn't buying it.
1018150,aplumma,2017-11-22 17:39:00,6896,He he yes I to am a confessed hoarder of ammo. I like to  shoot and between the calibers of the rifles and pistols I have last count was around 8000 rounds. Hope this helps you out of the doghouse.   Art

1018488,aplumma,2017-11-29 20:50:00,6896,It is a shame really but you have to buy in bulk now if you like to shoot. A simple .17 HMR is 22 cents if you buy a box of 50 but buy 5 boxes and it goes down to .16 cents.  The larger caliber have gotten to the point that it is worth reloading an round bigger than a .308. The .50 cal. is just insane at $3.50 if you bulk buy 200 rounds or better.  Art

1018507,grimsbylander,2017-11-29 23:35:00,3016,.50 cal...nice.
