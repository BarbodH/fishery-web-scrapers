1018665,jimmer,2017-12-01 20:16:00,2730,First I heard of this.  He could be very funny.
1018677,aplumma,2017-12-01 22:27:00,6896,I have always loved him for his voice and humor. I still watch him in reruns most nights. I am sorry he is gone.  Art
1018694,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-02 02:52:00,8243,Gawwwwwwlee. Amazing singer. You would never expect that voice to come out of Pvt. Gomer Pile USMC. Goober was my favorite. Rip Jim Nabors.
1018699,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-02 04:31:00,2582,On 97.3 radio today they said he died at 87 and was survived by his husband. Never  saw that coming and don't care for what it's worth. However if that's the case it only illustrates his talents and how much he got into our souls.  Gay way back then and still did what he did. Must have been someone we would have all been happy to sit around a campfire and shared a beer and a story with.
