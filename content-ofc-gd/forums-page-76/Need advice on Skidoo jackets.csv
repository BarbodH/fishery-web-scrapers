1018692,Fisherman,2017-12-02 02:08:00,7201,Choko makes decent products
1018698,Woodsman,2017-12-02 04:01:00,1286,Is floatation part of your requirements?
1018702,Joeytier,2017-12-02 04:50:00,3990,I suggest buying an ice fishing specific jacket.  Skidoo jackets tend to be a little cramping for long days on the ice.  FXR and Frabill both have awesome coats better suited to sledding and ice fishing.
1018704,Terry,2017-12-02 10:02:00,14456,I suggest which ever type you get make sure it is also a floater jacket.
1018708,muskymatt,2017-12-02 14:10:00,2608,Thanks! I'll check them out!
1018709,muskymatt,2017-12-02 14:10:00,2608,I'm starting to lean that way yes! A buddy recommended Frabill.
