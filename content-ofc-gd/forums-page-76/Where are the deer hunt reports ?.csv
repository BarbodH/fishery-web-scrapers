1018476,Rod Caster,2017-11-29 18:26:00,5784,"Yeah, I was talking about pre-field dressed weight. I bet my wife would like to report her field-dressed weight too (it's ok, she doesn't read OFC)"
1018478,Mister G,2017-11-29 18:41:00,1429,"So how much do you think the gut pile weighs, I have no idea but I'm guessing about 40 lbs......might of heard that somewhere."
1018497,misfish,2017-11-29 21:23:00,29133,"Hope this helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  BTW, I have seen a few does that were in the 200+ before dressed. These were taken way in the bush .  https://www.noble.org/news/publications/ag-news-and-views/2012/february/estimating-deer-weight-from-field-dressed-weight/  "
1018525,turtle,2017-11-30 11:31:00,274,"I'm waiting for colder temps & some snow on the ground to get out again with the bow or the end of the controlled hunt.  I do these hunts alone & snow makes everything better with easier tracking, better last light & hopefully more daylight deer movement.   I did the first week of rifle this year in Haliburton & it was the best year in the last five (slow) years.  Seeing more moose every year and this fall more bears.  Rare to see a bear in November where we hunt & this year my group alone saw three adults. The does I've seen are usually 100-125 dressed. A 200 lb. dressed buck is a large deer in my experience.  I dragged one out of the bush solo last December.  I've heard of 250-260 lb. dressed weight bucks that would be 300 lbs. live but never seen one."
1018531,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 14:43:00,8243,"I've seen very few hunters trucks parked on the road side this year and not many gun shots the week of shotgun. Usually there are trucks from one end to the other on the main roads here at the farmers back 40 wood lots and often I will see them loading the Deer in the trucks, not this year. I wonder why?  Usually guys are offering me Deer if I will cook some for them (not all hunters can cook) none from this area this year."
1018536,Rod Caster,2017-11-30 14:59:00,5784,I'd also guess upwards of 40lbs on a big doe.
1018539,BillM,2017-11-30 15:15:00,17367,Weather has really messed up the deer this year from what I've seen.
1018546,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 16:59:00,8243,"It must be something, thanks Bill. I haven't seen any deer running across the roads this year at the main game trail and they are usually very active now.  Plenty of Turkey but no Deer. I accidently hit a bird last week and went back to check on it, it was basically deboned, sad."
1018586,misfish,2017-11-30 21:31:00,29133,"Im a loner as well and do like a week of fresh snow on the ground to figure out their movements. I like to sit just in the thick stuff with openings/ shooting lanes.  Open fields, I sit 5ft or so inside. Love those corner entrances."
1018590,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 21:50:00,8243,"Not a lot off topic but I have to ask what is your favorite way to cook up Deer? I will make snitzels (sic) with the loin on mash taters and a wild mushroom gravy. Also cut the ribs in 2"" or so pieces on the band saw and make a stew with it like a French Canadian at the plant showed me, my favorite way. The whole shoulder or leg with bone in I make like a pulled pork low and slow with red wine, inserted garlic covered in white and red onions and some secret stuff called Montreal Steak Spice rubbed on it, sometimes an entire leg on the BBQ wrapped in foil.  Marinated over night. I will always add rendered bacon fat. Everything but the snitzell low and slow."
1018592,misfish,2017-11-30 22:01:00,29133,"Myself Im not a whole meat eater of venison. I mean, I would sooner make sausages, pepperettes and ground. The back strap gets cooked the night of the harvest. Marinade in italian dressing, slow cooked, sliced in 1/2 peices and put on crackers. Now if you give me a moose steak or roast, were talking good eats."
1018599,turtle,2017-11-30 23:00:00,274,"I cook the front end low & slow and the loin chops/back straps fast & medium rare.  The inside tenderloins fast fried or fast on the BBQ. I like any cut and any way prepared unless overcooked and too dry.  I like stews with tomato, garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme & dark beer and mashed potatoes of course .  One cut I like but usually ends up as stew or ground is a neck roast also low & slow.  Moose is also great but I haven't hunted moose (successfully) for some time and very little has been gifted to me."
1018768,misfish,2017-12-03 18:15:00,29133,"When I open the front door this morning to go fishing, I was greeted by a 10 pt buck walking up the side walk. He was just wandering looking around. They are building so much around here, they have no where left to stay."
1018816,BillM,2017-12-04 20:11:00,17367,"Are we talked dressed weights here or what?    A 200lb dressed doe would be a rare bird.   That's a big ass doe.   Now a 200lb doe with all her guts in her isn't a big deal.   What do gut piles weigh?  40-60lbs?    I've got no doubts there are a lot of does walking around that are well over 200lbs.   Wayne, if you need any of them shot let me know, lol!!!"
1018213,misfish,2017-11-24 00:10:00,29133,"All I have been hearing is, this year was a banner year for harvesting. If you have a report and pictures of your hunt and harvest, please post. I really miss getting out there the past 3 years. Next year I hope to be back at it. Well, I will be with the bow, but my use of a firearm is up in the air. Not because Im a criminal or anything like that, but a health reason. Hope to find out next month if I will be able to rifle hunt. Shot gun blast would be more detrimental I think. Will find out like I said.  Hanging of the harvest, is my favorite."
1018216,irishfield,2017-11-24 00:40:00,26272,I helped load a 200 or so pound Doe last night...  Spiked buck got to live another day..
1018217,Marty,2017-11-24 01:02:00,873,DIrt's first deer.  
1018218,Freshtrax,2017-11-24 01:12:00,2215,Had a decent buck walk in this morning would not provide a shot with the bow.    Was slow for us in Smith's falls for 1st week of rifle.
1018221,irishfield,2017-11-24 01:37:00,26272,What you doing hunting down in Sin City Andrew...
1018222,Freshtrax,2017-11-24 02:21:00,2215,Wife's family has hunted the same 300 acres on Carroll rd for 50 years.  Quality time with the outlaws
1018232,misfish,2017-11-24 13:11:00,29133,"Nice young buck Marty. He,ll never forget that one.  Thats a big doe Wayne. Your area does have ample food for them to grow that big.  Keep at it Andrew. He,ll give you a shot. Is the rut on ? The way the weather has been, they maybe mixed up still. LOL"
1018234,manitoubass2,2017-11-24 13:31:00,11391,The deer numbers here have been insane! Moose too. I couldn't partake this year because of injury but I was gifted a nice doe! The dogs sure appreciate their carcass! About a month ago I had to head to kenora and just before souix narrows I seen the biggest buck I've ever seen in person. It's probably up on someone's wall now lol. Man was it THICK!
1018239,Rod Caster,2017-11-24 16:45:00,5784,I got a button buck. Used up my doe tag.  This guy has been haunting my dreams...That day time photo was yesterday morning.  
1018240,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-11-24 17:09:00,535,"Still trying for my first. I haven’t seen anything since rifle opened. I saw about a dozen during bow but the only ones that came within range were two fawns (which I let go) and a spikehorn which I shot but just nicked him, the blood trail (which wasn’t much) stopped completely after 100 yards or so. I had a 10 point come out 20 minutes after dark last Tuesday. Hopefully he’s still alive and will come back during the day when I’m off next week. "
1018241,BillM,2017-11-24 17:11:00,17367,"Didn't see anything but does during rifle season in Brockville a few weeks ago.   Will get back for muzzleloader.  Hopefully they're off the rut and onto food.   Should be a lot easier to pattern. Pissed I lost my spot to hunt where I got that monster last year (Still waiting for the mount as well, lol)"
1018242,manitoubass2,2017-11-24 17:21:00,11391,You should repost that pic bill I remember that being huge! I'd love to see how it compares to that beast I seen up by kenora
1018248,BillM,2017-11-24 20:16:00,17367,"I dunno if I'll never repeat this, I doubt it  "
1018253,misfish,2017-11-24 21:51:00,29133,Thats a real nice one Chad.  Bill Alberta will give you your fix. LOL 
1018274,pics,2017-11-25 17:31:00,1268,I had a spike buck in my sights but he was in some really tall grass at about 30 yards. I passed on the shot rather than try to shoot and possibly just injure him.. I have seen deer each time out but that was the best opportunity so far..
1018296,misfish,2017-11-26 19:46:00,29133,"Thanks guys for the reports . As I was walking through the bush to my river stretch, my thoughts were thinking of sitting in a tree. The wind was up, but the bush was so quiet. That was weird. I even had to step on a branch to see how far and loud it sounded.  I cant wait til next season to be out and sitting again. I drove back looking at bush areas on private land. I will be making my rounds come the spring and knocking on doors. See if I get lucky to find some property. I past 3 known spots on my way to the river. There were 3-5 trucks at each. It,s getting busy it seems around here."
1018313,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-11-27 02:20:00,535,"My wife just got her first deer, a button buck. She’s pretty excited, well we both are. I’m gonna try to get a buck this week. I’m just stoked to have some meat in the freezer."
1018407,Mister G,2017-11-28 21:45:00,1429,200 lb Doe...........now that's funny.......
1018432,Freshtrax,2017-11-29 02:09:00,2215,On the hoof I belive I've  seen a few 200 lb does . This  is the one  who has been outwhtting me all season. Sit number 8 for him in the morning.
1018439,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-29 03:00:00,8243,"If you want to get a 200lb Doe all you need to do is drive the I-90 through what they call the southern tier of NY state and into Pa and Ohio. The side of the highway is littered with massive deer in November, big Deer. It's illeItgal to stop on the interstate to load road kill unless you hit it, 10 years ago at least."
1018440,Freshtrax,2017-11-29 03:24:00,2215,Baby' s compared to Ontario deer body size  but numbers yes.
1018461,Rod Caster,2017-11-29 15:48:00,5784,Not that irregular up here. I saw one hanging this year.
1018468,irishfield,2017-11-29 17:36:00,26272,"Now I remember why I stopped posting much, with a few condescending  around here... but thanks for the back up guys. I know what I can lift with ease, and myself and the fit 70 year old hunter on the other end didn't just throw her into the truck box!"
1018470,Mister G,2017-11-29 18:04:00,1429,"Right away with trying to call me a A$$ without knowing the facts. This is why many newbies don't return here. I'll take the high ground and let it go. Buddy of mine has a deer processing business and has butchered thousands of deer of the years. He was asked to do a demonstration of how to butcher deer at Cabela's a year or two back and I dropped by to see him do this. One of his first questions to the crowed was how many of you shot a 200lb ""doe"".......many hands were raised and he laughed and said he could count the number of 200lb ""does"" on one hand and said how heavy is this deer hanging here. No one came even close as it field dressed out at 87 lbs. BTW when talking weight of deer, we always field dress our animals before putting them on the scale."
1018473,irishfield,2017-11-29 18:11:00,26272,"If you'd been taking the high road, you would have never made the crack in the first place trying to look important! FACT is, I know what I lifted into the truck. One fresh ""200 lb or so"" Doe that a seasoned hunter couldn't get in by himself. I don't care what it weighed after he hung and dressed it out."
