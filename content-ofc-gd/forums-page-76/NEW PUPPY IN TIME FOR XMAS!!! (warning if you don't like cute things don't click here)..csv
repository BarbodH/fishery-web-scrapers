1018736,lunkerbasshunter,2017-12-02 23:47:00,2585,Well we made the choice to add to our family and we have this little girl coming to us Dec 20th. She is a mini Golden doodle (red coat) We also have a 5 year Golden Retriever (autumn) who will love the little pup and help train her to be as good a dog as she is.  (hopefully) We have decided on the name Whiskey. My 11 year old son and I can't wait to get our new fishing buddy out on the water with us! Cheers!   
1018746,leaf4,2017-12-03 00:09:00,2466,Awesome! Be prepared for ridiculous amounts of energy all the time lol my brother has one and she's a year and a half and just crazy all the time haha
1018747,lunkerbasshunter,2017-12-03 00:12:00,2585,Thanks Leaf4.  We run and swim the heck out of our dogs so high energy is no issue for us.  My golden is 5 and acts like a puppy still around water or a ball. Cheers!
