This is because the line has been revamped for 2018.  New guides and reels seats and 3 new 10foot offerings.  Now I love the idea of a really long rod for launching wind resistant baits (IE. Double 10's) but I have not idea where I can store it..

I love the LT's they are great and a big difference when fishing all day over a cheaper model. I doubt I will buy one as I do not need another rod for myself but if I were looking for a new rod to add to the line up I would take a 10'
