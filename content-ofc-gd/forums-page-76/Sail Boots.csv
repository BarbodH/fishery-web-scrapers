1018408,Garnet,2017-11-28 21:47:00,2056,A buddy showed me these boots on sale at Sail. They have a flip over ice cleat in heel. Only 40 below but look good just bad fit for me. They are black regular 99.99 and on sail for $70.
1018409,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-28 22:15:00,8243,I don't like Sail Boots. It seems the few times I was invited out there wasn't any wind.
