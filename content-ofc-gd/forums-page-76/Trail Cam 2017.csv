1018550,Rod Caster,2017-11-30 17:18:00,5784,From my property 2017. Feel free to add to thread.                       
1018552,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 17:56:00,8243,"All I can say is wow. I'm interested in the big black Cat. I didn't know there were Panthers in Canada. If that's a house Cat it better live in a big house. What is it? All the wild life is amazing to see but those Bucks sure are beauties, and thick. And I love those Wolves, Coyotes, Bushwolf or Coywolf. I wonder if the skunk gave whatever was following it a face full. Actually I like them all. Thanks for the neat pics Chad."
1018561,Rod Caster,2017-11-30 18:35:00,5784,"That's a fisher cat... although it's not really a cat, I believe it is in the weasel family. Seen a lot of them this year. They especially look cool when walking/running, they have a weird ""slinkiness"" to them. I had one cross my stand earlier this year and at first blush I thought it was a badger... big animal!  That was fox nosing a skunks rear, for whatever masochistic reason haha.  The wolves/brush wolves are awesome looking dogs! Real elusive too; in probably 40-50hrs in stand/ground/walking I never encountered a single one.  Thanks!"
1018572,DJGeneral,2017-11-30 19:58:00,163,do you think that skunk ever sprayed that fox? LOL
1018574,Terry,2017-11-30 20:11:00,14456,great shots
1018587,Cosmos,2017-11-30 21:46:00,588,"Thank you Chad, awesome pictures"
1018589,Cast-Away,2017-11-30 21:49:00,790,Very cool it is like watching the old show Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom!
1018593,misfish,2017-11-30 22:05:00,29133,"OMG, Thats dating back. Great shots"
1018596,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 22:25:00,8243,"About 14 years back for a few days 2 white Wolves walked out on the ice and laid there all day sunning themselves and only moved when the Sun did, that was cool to see and rare. Not just 1 but 2.  I couldn't get a good pic. These 2 were twice the size of a big Huskie. If I had film for my 35mm I could have shot them with the big 200mm telephoto lens. Now I keep a roll in the 35mm on standby. Those I phones are OK for taking close ups or selfies which I hate but not like a real deal 35mm camera. I showed all the boys at the marine shop today and they also were in awe, thanks again Chad."
1018600,Joeytier,2017-11-30 23:04:00,3990,Cool that you got a shot of the fisher.   Saw one crossing the lake last weekend...slinky is right.
1018627,limeyangler,2017-12-01 14:08:00,5204,"That is so cool chad, thanks for sharing."
1018687,Garnet,2017-12-02 00:04:00,2056,Most hear fisher cat and don't realise it. Think Siamese cat x 1 thousand .
1018689,G.mech,2017-12-02 01:54:00,830,I think we have problem with trash pandas in Norfolk County.....    Neighbours kitty cat was in the wrong place at the wrong time.....it was NOT amused!     
1018695,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-02 03:00:00,8243,We had a neighbour that fed those night rats every evening with bananas by hand. They moved and they marched over here. Dozens of them things. The 12 gauge with the plug out across the bow and they never came back.
1018706,Rod Caster,2017-12-02 13:35:00,5784,Trash pandas haha never heard that saying. I shot and ate one this year.  No where near a landfill and was a true bush specimen. It was actually pretty good.
1018707,Acountdeleted,2017-12-02 13:54:00,2562,Super cool Chad. Thanks for sharing these.
1018713,OhioFisherman,2017-12-02 14:48:00,6623,Great pics! Cool to see wildlife in action! LOL @ trash pandas!
