1018182,FloatnFly,2017-11-23 13:10:00,1640,Sail has the peak rotary vice on sale this week
1017018,cuzza,2017-11-06 17:27:00,467,"Nice first efforts Brian  Hopefully your Sail is better stocked than Burlington where they seem to be running stock down and to be honest it was never that great anyway. I buy a lot of material online, first place I look is always John in London, probably has the most stock and good prices, if he doesn't have it he can get it - http://www.freewebs.com/johnsflymaterials/if I want to look at stuff first and go talk fishing I hit Drift on Toronto (bit of a trek for you), good stock and Chris K works there, Flymart.ca also have some different stuff.  You can use sewing thread but you just need to get stuff that's fine enough as regular sewing thread is pretty thick by fly tying standards (or it was when I was a kid stealing my mum's stuff anyway!)  Whip finisher - they take some getting used to but if the thread keeps slipping off the loop near the handle, you may need to adjust it, mine did that and I closed the loop up with a pair of pliers and it helped enormously. I don't whip finish steelhead flies as they don't last long enough to fall apart, one or two half hitches does the trick. I do take the extra time on things like big/articluated streamers.  Keep up the good work"

They both work (well) for the same reason, they're a pink worm pattern and steelhead love pink worms! If I'm steelheading and can fish two flies, one is normally a pink worm of some kind. Brian, if you;re tying them up make some unweighted ones especially if you're going to fish them under a float.

I'm no expert by any means, I haven't even tied in a year or two, but here's what I found made the biggest impact for me.  1. Don't crowd the hook eye. Make sure to leave yourself space for the whip finish, otherwise you're constantly fighting materials in your way. 2. Tie a number of the same fly at the same time, rather than jumping from pattern to pattern. Try to make the next fly better than the last, focus on the small details. 3. Less is more. A sparsely dressed fly is easier to tie and fishes better.  Skip Morris has an excellent book, Fly Tying Made Clear and Simple, that will take you from a very basic caddis made from only dubbing all the way to dry flies. It's a nice way to learn techniques and build on them."

Practice practice.  Thanks again.  Most definitely. Like most skills practice is counts.  Always trim from the stem side of the hair or feather, never touch the thin end, that's the part that gives you the movement. So measure what you need for the tail, pinch it at the spot, tie it on where you have pinched, trim the excess that's covering the hook shank  Davie mcphail is good to watch, and also in the riffle.  Yep - always trim from the hair side. You can try moving a bunch of hair around on the hide to try to get the tips to align before you cut it. Might want to look for a hair stacker if you do a lot of work with hair, otherwise there are hand stacking techniques. I also found that some hair (dyed bucktail in particular) was very hard to stack until I washed it. It seems like if the extra dye wasn't rinsed out completely the hair was tough to work with. Just make sure you dry it out completely again to avoid mold or mildew.  Davie McPhail is a classic. Love that accent."

1016928,bigcreekdad,2017-11-05 13:39:00,546,"Keep going. And go smaller as you get more comfy. I agree that this would work as a caddis imitation.  I love making flies up. When my son was very young I let him design a fly. He chose the material and color, and I just started tying. WE had one that had so many colors it was ridiculous. It was also out of proportion to any bug I've ever seen. I showed it to some friends for possibilities for a name. After much discussion, we settled on ""the Hoar"". (Actually the spelling was hore with a w, but this sight does not allow such words...OMG!!)   I've been tying flies for Gates Lodge on Michigan's Au Sable River for 25 years. Occasionally, I would tie a fly and show it to the former,  and now deceased, owner to see if it warranted production in his shop. He was a stickler about flies he sold.They hand to be hand made by local fly tyers, and had to be tied perfectly. Occasionally, I would tie up a ridiculous ""new"" pattern, and would ask what he thought. One time, I tied an absurd looking purple and pink streamer. I showed it to him, trying not to laugh. He looked at it, looked up to me, turned his back and started doing something else. Wouldn't even respond. That day....I went to the Au Sable's South Branch and landed a very respectable brown trout on that ugly streamer. I took a picture of the fish, with that streamer clearly in its mouth, and emailed it to him when I got back to my cabin. Needless to say, I got no response from him at all.  Just have fun. It's a great pastime."

This is fun.  Bottom one with the tensile is crap, I over worked it I think or the peacock feather was not the one to use.  The beads are for making my walleye harnesses.

Actually, I've done the opposite....used fly tying thread to sew on buttons.  If you are thinking of ever tying commercial, I can assure you it ain't a way to get rich. I figure on an order of 300 flies, I might net the equivalent $8/hour. I do it for fun, and blow the little money I make on guide trips and fly gear."

Michaels will become your friend for supplies, foam, embroidery thread (the multi strand stuff) is awesome for woven flies, and you can get a unique look and colour combos  your beads you're using are too big for those hooks, they should slide over the hook point and rest up against the hook eye, you shouldn't be able to pull or push them over the eye of the hook.  hollow side of the bead faces towards the body of the fly  this is a very easy pattern, and pretty deadly for salmon and fall steelhead, its basically floss, marabou and flashabou wrapped around a spey hook  Woven fly using embroidery thread(weaving isn't hard, just a bunch of overhand knots)   these are easy easy easy, and you know how good pink worms are   The first fly i ever tied "
