Really taken to the muskies in recent times, and this fall they were the primary target.  Did quite well in the end, catching more 50+ inchers this year than any before.  Bren caught a great best and I managed a couple true Larry tanks that really did make all the time and effort worth it.  It was about five or six years ago and a trip down to St. Clair with my friend Andy when he kinda put the fire into me for these awesome fish.  Since then, its been hard not to appreciate the hunt for skis. Last fall I tried targeting sturgeon as well.  This year with friends and family along we took that up a notch.  A few great days were had on the water with everyone boating multiple fish and a sixty-incher or better. A couple outings I broke away from both these fish to enjoy a half day solo back lake fish for smallies.  My only day bass fishing this year, it turned out alotta fun.  That second day out was a BOQ troll for fall eyes with a couple buddies.  It started slow until early afternoon when we found 'em! Those interested in the usual from me can read on if they like... LUNKER'S OF THE FALL. FALL'S FIVE FOOTERS FOR FAMILY & FRIENDS. Careful on that fresh ice and Happy Holidays gang. Bunk.  "

1018230,AKRISONER,2017-11-24 12:46:00,5558,"those skis are some friggin pigs also are those sturgeon in Ontario? no need for specifics, just curious where the heck in Canada you were. Bunk what was your best accidental catch this year? You could appreciate this but for us it was a 35 inch Gar on a weedless whacky rig in the pads hunting largies lol"
1018231,bigugli,2017-11-24 12:55:00,6138,Great read. Your young one has you dialed in pretty good. LOL
1018233,manitoubass2,2017-11-24 13:26:00,11391,Those sturgeon sure are fat!!! They don't get that thick around here They sure fight though eh bunk!
1018235,msp,2017-11-24 14:14:00,1336,"As usual, nice going Bunk. I love that custom black and orange spinnerbait. I like the Fox spoon as the blade"
1018270,captpierre,2017-11-25 13:33:00,2521,Incredible Bunk. You da Man!???
1018272,Moosebunk,2017-11-25 17:03:00,3970,"  Ohhhh she's a helluvalot smarter than I was at her age... maybe smarter than me at my age now too.   The sturgeon are from France... or some country like that.  Can't actually think of any cool incidentals this year dood!  Gar would certainly surprise ya if not used to them.  Toothy nightmare.   Few fish are as stubborn at the end of the line, that's for sure Rick.   Sadly it's at the bottom of the river.  This spring some rainy day or two I'm looking to make another.  Losing the careful work is more annoying than losing the dollars put into one.  Total confidence it'll be a great summer bait to troll up top.   Thank you sir.! And thanks for reading gang."
