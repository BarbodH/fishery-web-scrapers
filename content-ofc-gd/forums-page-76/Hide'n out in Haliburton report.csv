1017869,chris.brock,2017-11-18 05:40:00,4053,"     I am heading down south in 2 days. There won't be anyone wearing toques or gloves or long underwear down there . There won't be a cold north wind or grey, miserable days.    There won't be any ice on the ponds or the back bays. The only ice will be in the rum drinks.    There won't be any kindling to make or logs to split or ashes to clean. The only fire will be for the pig roast.    There definitely won't be any snow to shovel. The only need for a shovel would be to scoop up all the bull crap spewing from the other people's mouths at the bar.     There won't be this and there won't be that, but sadly there won't be any of these.                "
1017870,lickmyarmpit,2017-11-18 06:54:00,359,Down south?   There isn't going to be any ice fishing there.  I'll take care of your trout while your gone.  Just tell me your coordinates.  Where down south you going?

1018049,chris.brock,2017-11-21 01:31:00,4053,"He doesn't toot his own horn but he's way more junkie, knowledgeable and dialed in than I will ever be."
1018057,Chuck Enwinde,2017-11-21 06:35:00,247,"Ha!  This coming from the only guy in the province still out crushing largemouth this weekend lol.  Good times as always Chris.  Funny story, had a chance to meet Chris' mom and she casually asked what lake we were going to?  Just as I was about to respond Chris cuts me off with a made up lake name!  He explained later that his folks talk to too many neighbors up there.  If ever there was a truer sign of a trout guy, I haven't seen it."
