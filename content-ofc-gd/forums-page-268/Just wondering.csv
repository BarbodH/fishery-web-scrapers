822797,Christopheraaron,2013-12-08 03:09:00,3525,This is probably a really stupid question but I was wondering if anyone knows what kind of power those small kids ATVs have? Would it be enough to tow a small ice fishing sled? Would be kind of cool to use one out on simcoe to get further out than you can by walking.
822799,hockeyplayerz_14,2013-12-08 03:11:00,160,"you may be ok to pull one out, but its only 2x4 so you'll be slipping, with my yamaha 450 I'm usually in 2wd unless theres snow and/ or i get stuck  , you never know it could be a good investment."
822800,irishfield,2013-12-08 03:12:00,26272,Remember you need licence.. insurance and helmut. One rider only...
822803,Christopheraaron,2013-12-08 03:17:00,3525,"Remember you need licence.. insurance and helmut. One rider only... Ya, but you need something to insure first haha"
822806,Christopheraaron,2013-12-08 03:22:00,3525,"Never really looked into this topic, what kind of license is required? Just a driver's license or is there another test?"
822809,chris.brock,2013-12-08 03:28:00,4053," I took a decent ride on my bro-inlaws kid's Grizzly 125, I came away with the impression that ""wow, this little thing is all you really need"", great in the tight bush trails, light weight to lift when necessary, simple to maintain and fix if necessary  if the snow is deep or there's slush on the ice, you're buggered, if not, sure it would tow a small hut  what make/ model are you looking at?"
822811,Christopheraaron,2013-12-08 03:35:00,3525,"Haven't really looked at any different models, just thought it would be an interesting idea."
822818,chris.brock,2013-12-08 03:49:00,4053,"it's a definite option,  there's going to be the guys that chime in and say ""noooo, you need at least a 600, don't be a woman!""  for me, I don't have money to burn or an ego to pump up, I love my Bravo 250 longtrack sled and 250 Trail Blazer 4 wheeler"
822855,pipeguy,2013-12-08 12:52:00,5,"Cheapest  way out will be to buy small old sled, they are pretty simple and reliable, just IMO, thanks."
822863,aplumma,2013-12-08 13:47:00,6896,I had a yamaha 80 4 wheelers it didn't tow anything however it would run like a scalded dog. The best part of it was if it got bogged down you just picked it up and moved it. I found that it was an issue if the snow was deeper than the clearance of the chassis. Stay away from the knockoff units they are junk with an attractive price you will break them quickly and find that parts are not easy to find if at all.   Art
