822547,livinisfishin,2013-12-06 23:27:00,661,I have had this unit laying around for a long time but have never used it. Problem is that I do not have a power cable or a transducer for it. I can make a power cable but I can't find a transducer anywhere online. Does anybody on here have an old one laying around or perhaps know of a comparable transducer that could work? Possibly the magna 2 ?  Thanks
