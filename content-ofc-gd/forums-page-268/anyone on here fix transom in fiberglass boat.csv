821516,skinny,2013-12-01 12:13:00,442,ok so the boat I just bought in the fall has a sofy spot I found but the out drive. I found it the day I was packing it up for the winter and moving to storage I did not poke a ton at it yet so I'm not sure how big it is or how bad  the hul is glass this is the wood in the back and it's by the out drive. I'm looking for info or options  sucks I didn't see before and I'm real sure guy that sold it didn't either  I'm hoping its a small spot of not much concern till next fall as i would like to use it  also been looking at a epoxy that they say u can patch with

There's no way around it, there's some surgery involved,  cut out the bad stuff, replace and reseal.  Putting a bandaid over gangrene doesn't fix it.  Finding the little spot usually ends up being much bigger once you start fixing"
821542,aplumma,2013-12-01 14:09:00,6896,Removal is the only option and keep digging till you get to solid wood without any water damage. When you replace the wood pay attention to any areas off to the side of the bad wood to make sure you reseal them. Winter is a good time to take on the project so you don't rush thru it.    Art

821921,fishnsled,2013-12-03 16:32:00,3520,"As said, best to rip it out and replace.  Looks like a bit of work but should be something you can handle with the help of a couple of buddies.  There is a product that you mix up and pour into a mold that you make up on the transom.  You end up with a solid fiberglass transom which I would guess would be stronger then a wooden one and would last much longer I would think.  I don't have any experience with this but thought I would mention this method whether you end up doing it yourself or get someone to do it.  Wood might be the cheaper way to go though."
