822645,woodenboater,2013-12-07 16:58:00,2277,"Was screaming and laughing my head off during the 5 round war between the Super Samoan and Bigfoot. Had to be THE BEST hw fight I've ever seen, bar none.  While I had Hunt winning, I'm not going to complain about the draw.  Takeya Mizugaki also impressed the hell out of me."
822650,Fisherpete,2013-12-07 17:39:00,1814,"I tend to get loud during GSP fights, although in the last fight it was more like yelps of fear when he was getting hit..."
822653,manitoubass2,2013-12-07 18:17:00,11391,That was an amazing battle!!!
822717,vance,2013-12-07 22:51:00,719,Last time I heard anyone scream at the tv was when the BEATLES were on the Ed Sullivan show and my sister went into hysterics...........    vance
822733,grimsbylander,2013-12-08 00:04:00,3016,That heavyweight battle was great. It's surprising how much damage their punches do even when they're at the point of complete exhaustion. Scary.
822744,Moosebunk,2013-12-08 00:35:00,3970,"Didn't know it ti'll taking the wife to her first NHL game at ""The Garage"" but from the second section she can pretty well turn every head within a hundred yards radius when she gets piped up.  Like that every sporting event and concert... and loves her GSP on TV too.  Shhheeesh!"
822750,Dan668,2013-12-08 01:03:00,1120,Screaming at the ref when he checked bigfoot in round 5. Let him recover. Maybe Hunt would of had a tko. Killed his momentum.

822822,GBW,2013-12-08 04:01:00,8460,Just watch your TV bill over the next 2 months is all I CAN say about UFC 167...  LOL!
822827,BillM,2013-12-08 04:20:00,17367,One of the best fights in the past few years.  They were both throwing BOMBS!!!!!
822833,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 04:53:00,536,"Just saw the fight today.... INCREDIBLE!!! Best fight I've seen in that weight class, quite possibly ever. They should have gave Hunt the win."
822873,Musky or Specks,2013-12-08 14:59:00,2710,I don't watch UFC but I certainly scream a lot at coach Casey when I'm watching the Craptors.
822882,Terry,2013-12-08 15:33:00,14456,Screaming at the ref when he checked bigfoot in round 5. Let him recover. Maybe Hunt would of had a tko. Killed his momentum.   yeah I thought the same
