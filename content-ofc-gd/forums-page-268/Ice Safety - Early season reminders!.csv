First, here's a video about what to do if you fall through the ice....I was amazed at it and if you haven't seen it before, I bet you learn a thing or two!   Here's a guide to what the ""safe"" amount of ice is... Let's see all your fish this winter....but most importantly....be safe out there!"
821927,Freshtrax,2013-12-03 18:13:00,2215,5 inches on the sled still scares me...  I always wait for around 8 of so when fishing....if I don't plan on doing less than 80 mph. I might me ok on 5

821975,Christopheraaron,2013-12-03 22:33:00,3525,Thanks for posting! I always try to watch that video a couple times a year to remind myself.
822008,irishfield,2013-12-04 00:31:00,26272,Here's something to keep in mind... it's not necessarily the mouth/outlet of a river that's the unsafe spot on the ice. It could be further out...  Shot I got today in Hogs Bay..
822009,Terry,2013-12-04 00:33:00,14456,and if unsure of the ice conditions follow a fat man  not too close
822020,NAW,2013-12-04 01:08:00,4022,I was hoping to check some conditions this weekend.  But the daytime temps may put a stop to that....
822110,mike rousseau,2013-12-04 16:03:00,4661,LMAO!!!!!  So that's why my buddies send my first with the spud....  I guess I'm on a diet now... Lol
822126,Lunkerhunter,2013-12-04 18:47:00,455,hahaha i always get sent first too. REALLY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS A WORD WE USE HERE.
822129,NAW,2013-12-04 18:57:00,4022,"Start of the season last year, i was 220..  Start of the season this year, I am 170... And no longer the heaviest in my crew!!  No leading the way for me this year!!"
822133,Big Cliff,2013-12-04 19:19:00,6899,Probably one of the best posts of the season and could very easily end up saving someones life.  Thanks for the reminder!

I might me ok on   I believe it was two winters ago that I was out at Long Point and decided to get away from the crowd by heading out to no mans land on the ATV. Once I got to my spot I fired up the Jiffy and it seemed like the auger had just touched the ice when water started flying.  Apparently when you're surprised by the fact that you're standing on 3"" of ice with an ATV and gear you get butterflies in your stomach      Don't forget that the type of ice you're on makes an enormous difference in how strong it is and black (clear) ice is the strongest and is twice as strong as white (frozen snow and slush, late season melting) ice. The safety charts are referring to the minimum of clear ice required so you should pretty much double those numbers when you're looking at soft white ice."
