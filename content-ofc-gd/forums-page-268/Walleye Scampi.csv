Then poured that over walleye in a baking dish...  Seasoned with salt... Pepper... Dill... Oregano and parsley....  Then baked at 350 for 25 minutes....  Turned out amazing.... No leftovers....  Thought I'd share...

822784,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-08 02:35:00,2582,Sounds good Mike. If you wanna try something different to go with that . Cook up some Basmati rice. Dead easy. The leftover sauce from baking any kind of fish is awesome over Basmati rice. Chop up a few green onions and sprinkle over the fish and rice and drizzle with the sauce from the baking dish... some salt and cracked pepper....AWESOME
