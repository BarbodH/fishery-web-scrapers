821838,redpearl99,2013-12-03 00:48:00,259,"Last year I went ice fishing for the first time.  Since then I have slowly come to get the ice fishing bug.  I wasn't able to contain myself as I've amassed the following equipment during this off season, all purchased new.  I'm hoping to finally get out on some bigger lakes for some nice lakers and pike. - Eskimo Fatfish 949i - Humminbird Ice-45 flasher - 6"" hand auger - Sienna 1000RD reel spooled with 10lb powerpro ice braid and 8.8 lb floro leader - Rapala xice med action rod and reel spooled with 4lb floro - HT ultra light perch rod - HT polar tip up with 25lb tip up line - windlass tip up - Jet sled - portable snow shovel - buddy heater - columbia waterproof snow pants - woods goose down jacket - Misty mountain thermal underwear and winter sock - portable ice fishing chairs - aerator bait bucket - rapala jigging raps and williams jigging spoons  It should be a good season.  I'm super excited"

821842,Ron,2013-12-03 01:06:00,1683,"Nice haul!  To me, ice fishing is just as addictive as Muskie fishing. Then again, all fishing is addictive to me.  Cheers, Ron..."
821848,Rod Caster,2013-12-03 01:29:00,5784,Nice! You'll eventually get to a point where you'll realize you have too much stuff haha
821849,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-03 01:33:00,4399,You must be single...or soon to be!
821851,BillM,2013-12-03 01:42:00,17367,"If you get out a lot, you really should consider a floater suit."
821853,Acountdeleted,2013-12-03 01:58:00,2562,I gotcha beat. I have two of Jacques (trout junkie) tip ups that I haven't had the chance to use yet. They have taunted me for too many days.  Gotta agree with Bill though. Float coat or float suit is always a good buy.
821857,NAW,2013-12-03 02:25:00,4022,"It's never ending man.  Next it will be a $10,000 quad.  And $500 gas ice auger.  A $50,000 truck to tow the quad.  Maybe a cottage up north so you have a place to stay EVERY weekend!"
821859,redpearl99,2013-12-03 02:28:00,259,^ those are next year's plans
821876,chris.brock,2013-12-03 07:15:00,4053,"you seem to have a lot more disposable income than I do (Hahaha)  like Art said, a 6 pack of Lucky Lager and you're good to go!  Bill's bang on, my 1 piece float suit is 20+ years old and was worth every penny, warmth and safety"
821892,Steelheadphycho,2013-12-03 13:24:00,470,+1 Ill make mine a pint of scotch....... And don't forget the ham SAMMICH!
821911,Christopheraaron,2013-12-03 15:33:00,3525,"If you get out a lot, you really should consider a floater suit. Got mine for $80 used last year, definitely worth it"
821931,aplumma,2013-12-03 18:56:00,6896,Hot ham and swiss cheese with a slather of cold mayo and fresh ground pepper.   MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm   Art
821933,NAW,2013-12-03 18:58:00,4022,My fishing partner is of Ukrainian decent.  So he usually brings lots o kielbasa and home made perogies.  So good!

821952,Moosebunk,2013-12-03 21:23:00,3970,"Sell the tip-ups and make some sort of tip-downs for your second deadstick.  Always seems more fun to play a fish on a rod versus by hand.  Otherwise, looks like you're more than equipped to rock out there.  Some good stuff."
822049,Steelheadphycho,2013-12-04 02:58:00,470,Oh dude yeeeeeeees!!!!!!
822050,Steelheadphycho,2013-12-04 03:00:00,470,High five on the perogies!!!
822084,manitoubass2,2013-12-04 13:13:00,11391,We always called them pedahey sp.  which is weird because im ukaranian and i do not know what that word even means haha. Delicious nonetheless
822086,NAW,2013-12-04 13:26:00,4022,"That's what he calls them too...  It was on the tip of my tongue, just couldn't remember the exact word."
