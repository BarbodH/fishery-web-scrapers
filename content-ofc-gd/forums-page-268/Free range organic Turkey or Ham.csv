Not sure why wild turkeys don't seem to get it. Domestic turkeys are a unique breed that are bred specifically for the table.  Their breast meat is so large, they cannot mate naturally. The male can't reach.  So if your kid doesn't know what they want to do with their lives, there's always a carrier as a Turkey BREEDER."
821667,captpierre,2013-12-01 21:31:00,2521,"21-27 days is prime beef aging range.  Kobe and Certified Angus (certified is not the crap you buy at Sobey's marked 'black angus') are aged this long which is one third the reason for their incredible flavour and tenderness. Even how the cow is slaughtered will have an effect on the meat. It's little known but halal slaughter methods actually do produce a more tender cut in the end.  HOWEVER a grass fed cow will always produce a better marble and overall flavour if slaughtered and hung the same as a corn fed cow, that's just fact. They can both turn out pretty good though.  Grass fed beef can be grade F to Canada Prime in rating.  Corn fed never goes higher than AAA. Cattle not fed grain for the last 3+ months before slaughter have very little marbling and fat cover.  They can't eat enough grass and hay alone to fatten up.  They need grain or corn silage to fatten.   Aging the meat after slaughter is key.  The carcass loses about 5% of weight/week of hanging.  Supermarkets don't age meat at all.  To much $ loss.  That's why supermarket meat is hit and miss in terms of tenderness.  A good butcher would be a better choice but you will pay more.  Costco always has tender steak but they, as well as many supermarkets, mechanically tenderize their steak.  This is controversial. CBC's Marketplace did a show last year on this topic.  Mechanically tenderizing with a machine that punctures the loin, from which steaks are cut, potentially pushes E. Coli from the surface(where it is easily killed by heat) to the centre.  Unless the steak is cooked well, there is risk of disease.  For the same reason, Guys, never eat ground beef unless well done.  Surface germs are mixed into the centre thru grinding.  In a non mechanically tenderized piece of meat, germs on the outside are detroyed even if the meat is rare in the middle."

Them move them out to a paddock for a week of excersize before processing.    The only reason ours are grass/hay fed is its  cheaper for us, and we only do 3 at a time.   Tastes great to me ,"
