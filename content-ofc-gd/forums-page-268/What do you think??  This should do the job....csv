822511,NAW,2013-12-06 20:17:00,4022,"I am eventually going to buy a proper Ice-Ducer.  But the cheap   in me wants to try this first...        For the last few years, I've been trying to use it with the plastic suction cup mount still attached (cup removed).  And in anything deeper than 30', it's a pain in the butt.  Constantely having to tweak it so it's pointing straight down.  I rigged this up so it hangs perfectly straight.   The one big downside I can see right away, is the strain relief (or lack there of) on the chord entering the transducer.  But I'm thinking it should work pretty good.  Thoughts?   Anyone try something like this before?"
822518,kickingfrog,2013-12-06 20:58:00,8333,Should do the job. I've done similar and eventually got rid of the foam because it got in the way and didn't help.
822520,kickingfrog,2013-12-06 21:07:00,8333,The next step for me was this:  
822521,NAW,2013-12-06 21:09:00,4022,"Do you have a ""T"" at the top of that to sit flat on the ice?"
822522,kickingfrog,2013-12-06 21:12:00,8333,I just used a hinge and another piece of wood. So more of a upside down L.

822527,aplumma,2013-12-06 21:30:00,6896,We use a product call strap iron in the plumbing world. It is flat metal with holes drilled in it. You can bend it as needed and if it where taped to the line you could tweek it as needed to shoot straight down. It would go where you have the rope for now.    Art
822529,misfish,2013-12-06 21:39:00,29133," Art  Those holes are stamped out by a press in a die, LOL"
822530,Big Cliff,2013-12-06 21:43:00,6899,That should work just fine! I made something similar a few years back and it did the trick. I did try making one with a wooden down shaft but the wood kept trying to float and it made it hard to keep it pointed straight down the hole. I ended up using a piece of aluminum tube and I drilled holes crosswise through it along the tube so I could set the depth and just used piece of aluminum rod that I put through the tube and rested it on the ice.
822531,irishfield,2013-12-06 21:49:00,26272,"That'll work Nick.. may have to play with the tilt a bit. Find yourself a 8"" piece of pipe wrap foam... and just loop the cable around through it.. then it's easily adjustable to get the 'ducer just below the  ice edge."
822533,BillM,2013-12-06 21:54:00,17367,"As long as it's sitting flat, it will work just fine."
822549,Locnar,2013-12-06 23:29:00,645,I basically have a metal version of your wood stick. Seems to work fine for me.
822552,NAW,2013-12-06 23:50:00,4022,"Thanks guys.  The metal strapping idea.  Funny thing is.. I was pondering things in the garage before starting this little project.... And I looked right at a bag of metal strapping.....  So if this doesn't work, it's a free upgrade!"
822554,Sinker,2013-12-06 23:56:00,8692,"A piece of plexiglass hinged on a wooden shaft works great for holding the suction cup straight and level. Put the plexi/suctioncup down the hole, and the wooden stick to keep it there. Works great."
822578,Nipfisher,2013-12-07 01:30:00,2449,"Nick, the electrical tape will not hold up in the cold water and cold weather. Buy yourself the waterproof duct tape and it will work."
822580,irishfield,2013-12-07 01:32:00,26272,That's the good Orr Lake Tape Nip... they put that .... on everything !
822591,NAW,2013-12-07 02:10:00,4022,"I was thinking that.  I didn't have any black hockey tape, or I would have used that.  Water proof duck tape!  I didn't know it even existing.  I'm gunna ask for that in my stocking!!!"

822596,Burtess,2013-12-07 02:45:00,901,You don't need the iceducer.  I used a heavy piece of copper wire tightly twisted to the transducer mounting hole.  Semi-tight cable ties hold the pipe insulation so that you can still move it up and down. This way you can easily adjust the angle the transducer sits and keep it flat to the water.    Burt
822598,NAW,2013-12-07 03:18:00,4022,Thanks Burt!  That's simple enough eh.  Except it throw some electrical tape on the just for the hell of it!
