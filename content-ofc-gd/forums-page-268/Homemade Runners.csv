I has the kodiak which is the big one man, but its not wide enough to have 2 rods going. I called a few plastic factories and found one in Woodbridge and called, the lady helped me out and found me a scrap piece of 3/4"" thick and a decent size to make 6 runners but I only need 3. Paid 20 dollars for the piece and here the steps….. The piece i bought, I can make 6; 1"" strips at 4' long and then another 6; 1"" at about 3 ft long, all for $20   Cut at 1"" thick on the bench saw, and torched the ends to fit the sled          The scrap came in handy when I wanted to fit the counter sink in perfect with no gap.    Drilled my holes    Time to install. Hardware cost about $10, so in total 30 dollars for thicker runners than the $80 dollar ones."

When I get my water slide done I'll see if I have any left overs from my TWO rolls to share..  Great job Alex... if nobody grabs the spares from you it's their loss, but you'll have material ready for next time if they don't!"
