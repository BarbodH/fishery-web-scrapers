821981,shimano19,2013-12-03 23:21:00,196,"hey guys, I would like to get out fishing more during the weekdays after work. I looked at the mouth of the credit and it looks like it has some nice area to fish off at night. I was considering going down tomorrow night after the rain to do some casting for steelhead using spoons, kwikfish and mepps. do you think the steelhead would be active enough to chase the bait or even be holding at the mouth at this time? give me some advice. thanks"
821993,Christopheraaron,2013-12-04 00:00:00,3525,"Not sure, never done it. But watch out I think they close it at 7pm (could be 10), cops were kicking people off earlier in the season."
822000,shimano19,2013-12-04 00:18:00,196,It's dosent say anything about it being closed in the regs. I'll double check
822001,Christopheraaron,2013-12-04 00:19:00,3525,"Not the fish, the park."
822070,Rich,2013-12-04 11:26:00,3927,I dunno if it'd be better or worse but you certainly have a shot at steelhead and lots of other fishies that way!
822119,BillM,2013-12-04 17:46:00,17367,"Getting mighty cold to be tossing hardware, but who knows.  Give it a shot.  With the warmer temps this week you might just be onto something."
822131,Rich,2013-12-04 19:10:00,3927,Still hammering spoons on the Erie tribs!
822220,porkpie,2013-12-05 00:53:00,2521,"You would be better server to fish the mouth of narrower tributaries that neck the river down a little to concentrate the fish, ie: some of our eastern creeks.   the credit is huge at the mouth in comparison, but certainly you could catch them there! I would toss an egg sinker with a floating roe bag, filled with stinky skein.  Bring a Coleman lantern, a lawnchair, a book and sit tight.  You most certainly can also catch them on hardware, but I prefer the flatfish and spinners in the daylight when the float bite slows down.  Night fishing for bows, I always fished big stinky jam bags off bottom, and it produced.  I don't fish trout at night anymore, and haven't in many years, but I don't imagine much has changed!"
822244,Tim Mills,2013-12-05 02:54:00,476,I was down there walking the dog last wed before my sons hockey game.  I did not see any signage restricting hours  but did see signs saying no fishing in certain areas on the east side of the river.  I was surprised to see about 10 boats still docked in the marina this late in the year.
822249,ch312,2013-12-05 03:05:00,1590,"So you guys are saying that trolling the shallows near rivermouths at this time of year might put some fish in the net? Seeing as there's no snow for tracking deer, I was thinking of taking the boat out this week..."
822273,jbailey,2013-12-05 05:15:00,866,"the parks close at 10pm, and i think the construction is still in the way to go under the QEW"
