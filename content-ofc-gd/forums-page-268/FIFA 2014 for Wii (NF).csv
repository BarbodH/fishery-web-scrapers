822043,ironstone74,2013-12-04 02:28:00,201,My son really wants this game for Christmas. We were told that EA is no longer making Wii games for North America. Does anyone know if a Wii game from England would work on our machine? Thanks!
822075,cuzza,2013-12-04 12:21:00,467,"The Wii is regioned like DVDs are so it won't work - there is probably a hack to get round it but you run the risk of turning your Wii into a white door stop. Shame if they really aren't doing Wii games for North America any more as they had some good titles, FIFA being one of them."
822082,Lunker777,2013-12-04 13:07:00,866,I would say your source was wrong. EA sports release FIFA for the PS4 / xbox one just this past month.  Have you gone to Future Shop or EB games ?

It's not being done for the WII U, but regular WII games work if you have the WII U.  ""FIFA 14, developed at EA Canada, will release worldwide within the next 12 months on Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and is available for pre-order** now online and other retailers.
