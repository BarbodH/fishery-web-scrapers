822462,limeyangler,2013-12-06 09:17:00,5204,It does not seem so long ago that i watched in amazement through a pub window in Soho (near to the South African Embassy in London) crowds of people in the street celebrating the release of Nelson Mandela. It really marked the beginning of the end of a system of brutal racial repression. What an extraordinary man……..truly free…. at last…..RIP and thank you.

822810,manitoubass2,2013-12-08 03:30:00,11391,"He did some good things, and alot of bad. Many people do not remember he was apart of a terrorist organization that was apart of horrible atrocities. He was also a communist. Remember that? Anyhow rip."
822816,Richie Razor,2013-12-08 03:39:00,536,"110% agree with this, I wish the media would tell the whole story sometimes."
822877,SirCranksalot,2013-12-08 15:11:00,3291,r he was apart of a terrorist organization  Terrorist is just a label. How else could the terrible acts of the apartheid regime be stopped?
822883,limeyangler,2013-12-08 15:35:00,5204,"He did some good things, and alot of bad. Many people do not remember he was apart of a terrorist organization that was apart of horrible atrocities. He was also a communist. Remember that? Anyhow rip. A little surprised you would say that Rick…but hey…everyone is entitled to their opinion. So what if he was a communist…..heck…i think there is a lot to say in favour of some Marxist ideas given the global economic situation….certainly still relevant…thats for sure!  As for terrorism….the Apartheid regime was also a terrorist organization….google the Sharpsville Massacre!"
