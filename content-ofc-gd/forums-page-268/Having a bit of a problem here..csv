822022,Roy,2013-12-04 01:13:00,13728,I  went to see a site and looked at some things for sale. There must be something wrong with my head tonight cause this just doesn't register with me. Please help. Right and left flags?  http://www.reelbait.com/ccp7/index.php?app=ecom&ns=catshow&ref=patches
822023,Terry,2013-12-04 01:17:00,14456,"yeah, you want them to match, as if you are looking at  both sides of the flag"
822024,kickingfrog,2013-12-04 01:24:00,8333,^Yep^. Not all flags are like ours.
822033,woodenboater,2013-12-04 01:41:00,2277,"that sounds weird, a flag only has one orientation imo."
822036,tb4me,2013-12-04 01:59:00,3295,they are for sewing together so you end up with a double sided flag..I think...lol
822039,Moosebunk,2013-12-04 02:12:00,3970,FTW!!!  Weird......
822040,Fisherman,2013-12-04 02:13:00,7201,they are for sewing together so you end up with a double sided flag..I think...lol Well..then you'd have a shirt for a toothpick if you sewed them together to put on as shoulder patches..
822041,fishnsled,2013-12-04 02:13:00,3520,"Explained: Because I had no idea.  Civilians often wonder why the US Army Flag Patch is reversed. The answer is: not all Army Flag Patches are reversed, but only those worn on the right shoulder. The reason has to do with proper display of the flag. The blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a ""moving object"" like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front. The same principle applies to the eagle rank of Colonels (or Navy Captains); the eagles' heads are always worn facing forward when worn on the uniform, as the forward-facing eagle is the position of honor within heraldry. In application, then, flags are displayed on moving vehicles with the blue-star field always displayed towards the front of the vehicle. In this way, the flag appears to be blowing in the wind as the vehicle travels forward (flags are always attached to their flag poles on the blue field side). If the flag were not reversed on the right hand side of the vehicle, the vehicle might appear to be moving backwards (or ""retreating""). The next time you visit an airport, notice that the US-flagged aircraft also have a ""reverse"" flag painted on the right side of the aircraft. For flag patches worn on uniforms, the same principle applies: the blue star field always faces towards the front, with the red and white stripes behind. Think of the flag, not as a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole. As the Soldier moves forward, the red and white stripes will flow to the back. As the proponent for standardization and authorization of heraldry items within the Department of Defense, the Institute of Heraldry addresses the apparent oddity of the reverse flag patch by stating, ""When worn on the right sleeve, it is considered proper to reverse the design so that the union is at the observer's right to suggest that the flag is flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward."""
