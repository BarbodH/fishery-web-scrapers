821349,grizzlybri,2013-11-30 18:21:00,565,I know that Sail has them and also Al Flaherty's outdoor store 2066 Dufferin you can see them on  www.alflaherty.com they are under the miscellaneous section under PFDs
821384,irishfield,2013-11-30 21:02:00,26272,Don't confuse a floater suit.. with a survival suit.. two VERY different things!
821396,cram,2013-11-30 22:56:00,1733,LeBaron has them. Cdn Tire has typically carried them. Salus is based in Waterloo....they may sell direct.BassPro likely has them as well.
821436,Live2fish85,2013-12-01 01:28:00,1633,Fishing world has them and you can order them off there web site. There is the Helly Hanson Delta and Alphas. We also carry Striker and Arctic Armor flotation suit.
821471,Pikeslayer,2013-12-01 02:37:00,1443,Yep.
821473,manitoubass2,2013-12-01 02:56:00,11391,"A floatsuit will ensure they find your dead body, a survival suit is what is worn by Les Stroud???"
821475,cram,2013-12-01 03:03:00,1733,Floater suits aren't survival suits but they aren't just for floating either. The good ones are designed to slowly let water into the suit and warm up a little.
821482,irishfield,2013-12-01 03:13:00,26272,"Yep, you've got to tighten all the straps so when the water gets in there it stays for the most part and trades off some body heat to warm it up. Buys you some time, but not a lot.. the main thing is it keeps you above water, hopefully long enough for you to get out or for someone to pull you out vs sinking to the depths when your body freezes up.  Survival suits are expensive, high quality, insulated dry suits."
821511,l2p,2013-12-01 07:48:00,346,"Thanks for clearing that up and for all the responses, I think i may have found what I was looking for!"
821512,BFSC Kevin,2013-12-01 07:51:00,1351,Haha! Finally spilling some dough for ice fishing ?!?!?!
821545,aplumma,2013-12-01 14:31:00,6896,We use drysuits when we raced jetskies in the winter. Wipeouts at 50 MPH in a drysuit and not a drop of water got in. The secret was to open the zipper and then go into the water up to almost the zipper forcing out the air and then zipping it up. These suits are not insulated so you put on what ever you needed to be warm.   Art
821554,grizzlybri,2013-12-01 15:29:00,565,"I realize it says floatation suits on the link I posted. I also realize the difference, I was just reading the description on some of the floatation suits and for the Mustang floatation suit it says  ""it works or foul or cold weather and  use closed-cell foam to offer floatation  and hypothermia protection in the event of water immersion"""
821798,LeXXington,2013-12-02 20:57:00,1928,Still much better to be in a floater suit with a .450 rating for hypothermia protection than a simple life jacket.  Most people that fall into cold water don't die from the hypothermia it's the drowing that kills you first.  stay safe!
821923,ch312,2013-12-03 16:38:00,1590,"Don't confuse a floater suit.. with a survival suit.. two VERY different things!  To 99.99% of fishermen a survival suit and floater suit are the same thing and ""everyone"" knows what you're talking about even though they're totally different suits.   Kinda like calling a walleye a pickerel. You're using the name of a fish that looks nothing like a walleye, but people still know what you're talking about"
