822559,Rizzo,2013-12-07 00:32:00,4754,this is supposed to be fun? No thanks
822563,kickingfrog,2013-12-07 00:42:00,8333,I would think it would be… as long as you don't crush your self on a narrow outcropping and then proceed to scrape your way down a thousand metres of cliff face to then bang your face off of your own knee once you finally hit the ground.
822564,MCTFisher9120,2013-12-07 00:46:00,3761,Unreal…that made me cringe 15 times ouch…he fell for 13 or 14 seconds just unreal.
822589,captpierre,2013-12-07 01:55:00,2521,Hard to feel sorry for guys who need to live on the edge like that
822590,woodenboater,2013-12-07 02:10:00,2277,"actually when he hit the deck in real time, it didn't look as bad as the slo mo. still the outcrop would have hurt something nasty ! goes he shoulda taken a better running jump..."
