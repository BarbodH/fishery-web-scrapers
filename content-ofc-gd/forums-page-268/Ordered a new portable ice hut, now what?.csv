822072,hookerdown,2013-12-04 12:00:00,110,"After a few years of consideration, research and lugging around a homemade hut, I finally ordered a portable hut.  Its 6' x 6' and 6'5"" (plenty of head room for a guy that is 5'6"".  I was thinking of using a silicone spray on the seams to water proof them, like you would for a tent.   As well I am toying with the idea of putting in an insulated floor made of 2'x2' sections.  What are your ideas?  Share your pics of any floors you made for your portable huts."
822091,manitoubass2,2013-12-04 14:04:00,11391,Why a floor? Isnt the point of a portable hut convenience? Seems to me that lugging around a portable floor would take away from the convenience and isnt really necessary. Just my two... Now take it fishing!
822093,bigugli,2013-12-04 14:12:00,6138,Get those simple interlock foam mats if you want an insulator from the cold. Simple and effective  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/kids-reversible-tiles-24-in-0686044p.html
822094,Lunkerhunter,2013-12-04 14:14:00,455,wear good boots. no need for a floor.  go fishing!
822128,NAW,2013-12-04 18:55:00,4022,"I also see no need for a floor in a portable hut..  But the designer in me is thinking you might be able to rig something on a hinge, that would also double as a cover while in tow.  That you could flip down first, than flip your hut over second...  Assuming your new portable it a flip over style that folds down into a sleigh.  Not sure what material you would use...  And it would get soaked all the time...  Doesn't sound worth the effort to me."
822135,Joey,2013-12-04 19:37:00,9122,I just have a piece of wood board with a few screws in the bottom so it won't slide around for my feet.  It does keep them a bit warmer than when they are just on the ice.  Fits sideways in the sled part of the hut so take up hardly any room.
822136,davey buoy,2013-12-04 19:51:00,5505,"We have some old interlocking rubber matts that are 1'square.I'll be cutting out four squares for guests that don't have warm enough boots.I have a heater,but if you don't buy warm enough boots,I hear you can get a chill on.  .Good boots are your first priority."
822145,hookerdown,2013-12-04 20:15:00,110,"Thanks Guys, what about waterproofing the seams with a scilicone spray?"
822146,davey buoy,2013-12-04 20:16:00,5505,"Thanks Guys, what about waterproofing the seams with a scilicone spray? I would like to know that as well,mines a year old now.?"
822154,manitoubass2,2013-12-04 20:48:00,11391,"Its just like a tent lol, helps but doesnt ""cure""."
822156,irishfield,2013-12-04 20:54:00,26272,"No need to be spraying a brand new hut with waterproofer... well there better not be anyhow!  I bought a 4"" wide roll of blue floor mat x 1/2"" thick and cut it in about 16"" strips so all the guys could have one when up at the lake. It does help keep your feet a bit warmer and the bonus is... it's the last thing you put on top of the load in the hut before putting the cover on to move to another spot. Slows the wear holes down a bit on the cover!"
822157,Burtess,2013-12-04 20:56:00,901,"I have the original pop out hut, the Eastman IceCube.  I think I got it in 2007 or thereabouts.  One pole has been repaired but I have never waterproofed it nor felt the need to.  In use you will notice especially on colder days that you will build up a lot of condensation on the inner walls and roof so I don't see any point in spraying the seams.  Doesn't drip though, just runs down the sides.  Burt"
822159,davey buoy,2013-12-04 21:01:00,5505,"Mine was perfect last year,I think we were hoping for a maintenance type spray if needed,or conditioner just to make it last longer.Wayne I sure hope there are no leaks already.A new portable every two years would be a little expensive."
822160,irishfield,2013-12-04 21:06:00,26272,"I have a Frabill  Davey... trying to remember from what year but I think 2008. So it's got at least 5 seasons on it and heading for 6...  It's been worn through in a few spots from running 40+ miles a day on Lake Temagami behind a snowmobile.... and patched with the cheap tent patches from CTC where it's worn through. We've been out in every kind of weather you could think of, from -38C to +11 and rain. It's a tent... I've never been wet.. and you are supposed to be dressed for the weather anyhow."
822161,aplumma,2013-12-04 21:06:00,6896,Look for a anti fatigue matt it is made of rubber and has air cells injected in it. It is light and rolls up easily. As far as the hut I would wax the zippers and let it eat.    Art
822187,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-04 22:34:00,10439,"I just use some of this stuff as a floor under my hut.    OH, and really good boots."
