But thats in between major coughing fits, which seem worse in the am and right before bed. Its pretty gross but thebody way of filtering out the chemical sludge seems pretty efficient. The days seem longer because your able to do so much more when your not stopping to smoke, i find that awesome! Ive drank lots of grean tea with honey and lemon and some peppermint just to soothe the am coughs. Feel great otherwise! Cravings are nil throughout the day. I get some in the evenings but there not as bad as the morning. Mid day is no problem. Still a little short tempered though"

821368,manitoubass2,2013-11-30 19:42:00,11391,I think the craving for diet soda is stronger than nicotine lol. Time for a big glass of perrier

821929,mercman,2013-12-03 18:40:00,7054,"Hey dude !!! 11 months for me. It was easier than I thought it would be, but the crave comes back every now and then. I use Nicorettes to help with that. I gained about 20 lbs, which has almost all gone now, but considering I lost 45 after the divorce, I am laffing Sense of smell was the first thing I noticed, then taste. I can smell a smoker from 50 feet away. I didn't have to quit coffee, because the only thing that ever triggered a smoke was beer, and I quit that habit 24 years ago. Keep it up, and if you start again....... quit again."
821977,mukluk,2013-12-03 22:47:00,196,I quit years ago because I did not want the doctor to tell me that my teeth are ok; but my gums have to go as well as one of my lungs. Each day I thank the good Lord that I am still here and had the will power to quit when I did.  (31 years ago)

I'm 2 or 3 packs a day for 50 years, cant walk the river, hard time launching my own boat, gave up hunting, cant even take my lady for a walk in the woods.  I know you have all heard it before but it needs repeating;  If you don't smoke don't start If you do smoke QUIT if you cant quit cut down Then when you can QUIT.  Well done Bud  Jim"
823062,Steelheadphycho,2013-12-09 04:11:00,470,"It so worth it though. I've noticed that even after I quit 17 months ago, I'm still crabby and snappy too. But I think my wife and child are getting use to it. I have been able to catch myself before spouting off and that does WONDERS for our relationship........ Keep it up man!"

I did the laser thing and it worked for me because I WANTED to quit. I think that is the key, you have to want to. If you have the desire, you can do it. Triggers be damned! I still to this day would love a dip after dinner, on the ride to work, FISHING!!!! Etc etc  GODSPEED!"

Pubmed can be your friend Good luck man....it's encouraging that you have done your ""research"". However that is such a very very tiny piece of the puzzle. Will power and commitment are far more important. The first 60 days are easy...the upkeep is the true test."

We quite using Champix although we were only on it for a month or so. We both really wanted to quite so when we had stopped for long enough we decided to put the money we were spending on smokes to use on something better. We both bought new vehicles. Now, even if I wanted to start again, I couldn't afford it... It is also nice to be able to look out at something as a constant reminder that it wouldn't be there if you were still smoking...  On a fishing related note, I find the years I am fishing and not smoking, I catch more fish. I don't know if it is in my head or if the scent of the smoke transfers to the bait and I get less hits but this summer was a great one for fishing.  Adam."

821233,Stef,2013-11-30 01:39:00,63,"OK    I'm not a big poster, but I see some people on here are frustrated at not being able to stop smoking.  I'll get to the point... if you started smoking with the thought that you would quite some day and think maybe that day is near, read a book first.  Don't use willpower alone, nicotine gum or patches or other drugs.  Just read a book.  Continue to smoke while you read it, but do read it to the end before you put out that last smoke.  No big health scares, etc. but  you will want to stop and will be able to stop relatively easily when its done.  I know, I didn't believe it either when I heard it and thought what a load of ...  I've seen it work with me and three others I have provided the book to... they all agree they can't believe it.  The books name is ""Stop smoking the easy way"" by Allan Carr.  Goggle it if you want, It'll cost you about $30 at Chapters... don't try to figure it out, just do it.  If you have already quit and find the going tough, get the book, you'll have a completely different outlook that will make things so much easier (but don't start smoking again while you read it LOL).  Don't say Bull... just do it!"

Taking a break from work to light up a dart, smoking in the car when it's raining outside, or chain smoking over a cup of coffee/alcoholic beverage. It's all really dumb, IMO, and I hope they ban smokes all over the place as well as the actual product it self.   Keep with it !"
