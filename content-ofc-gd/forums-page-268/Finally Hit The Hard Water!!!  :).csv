821862,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-03 03:18:00,10439,Finally managed to get out for a little hard water fishin’!! Spent a few hours fishing a little lake North of town for some whities. Wasn’t disappointed as we got a few for dinner. I was surprised that the lake already had 2 feet of ice on it.  A couple of shots of the lake      The spoils!!    Pre-cooking    Post cooking    Four minutes and eighteen seconds later!!!
