I decided to start off this season on one of them fishing for some first ice splake.  Loaded up the gear last night to ensure a quick departure for this today's adventure. I spent the early morning driving through a tunnel of snow in the headlights that seemed to be sucking me in like some type of tractor beam until I finally arrived in gods country.    The hike in for first ice trout always has me pumped.    Got to the lake and noticed the usual wet spots (springs)    After punching a few holes with the spud and finding 4-5 inches of ice it was game on    Time to spoon feed these suckas    The trout were on!  Caught a least 15 but no matter how many I released I just couldn't get that upgrade I was after so I kept these 5 cookie cutters and called it a day.    It sure felt good to be out on the ice again.  Tight lines and be safe out there.  Note: Most of the lakes I drove by were still not ready with all the snow we had, but this area really didn't get much snow until today."
821725,Joeytier,2013-12-02 04:01:00,3990,Great stuff.  What type of spoon is that?
821729,S.M.05,2013-12-02 04:17:00,145,Not sure the name. I picked it up some years ago and switched out the hook with something a little more fancy.  Wish I could find more cause the trout luv them.
821730,Sinker,2013-12-02 04:20:00,8692,Its nice to make the first tracks into a spot like that. Looks like a great day!  S.
821733,cram,2013-12-02 04:24:00,1733,Looks like a perfect day.   Awesome.

821739,davey buoy,2013-12-02 08:53:00,5505,"Nice catch,Were you running the spoon as is?, or tipping it with a minnow or something else ?."
821740,fishindevil,2013-12-02 10:11:00,6254,It's awesome when a fishing plan comes together !!! Some nice fish for sure !!!! First ice was always my fav time as well !!! Tight-lines
821750,chris.brock,2013-12-02 14:32:00,4053,"great report, 15+ fish is steady action, I have an old pike spoon I love and they don't make anymore, it sucks when that happens"
821751,manitoubass2,2013-12-02 14:39:00,11391,Holy calamity scream insanity!!! Wicked neeeeiiiice fish/report!!!
821752,Jds63,2013-12-02 14:42:00,1365,thanks for that report .... my favorite time of year handsdown ... can't wait
821758,Fang,2013-12-02 16:13:00,1330,I believe that would be an old Rebel Arrowhead spoon and it looks like you flipped it. Wide part was the original bottom. I have some old weedless ones still  Good spoon and hard to find
821772,Rod Caster,2013-12-02 18:16:00,5784,Great report. Those first photos look awesome
821779,Richie Razor,2013-12-02 18:57:00,536,"That is a pretty crazy looking spoon, I think Costco sells something similar in a set.... Nice splake - I love fishing them and of course eating them!!! Hopefully my lake is good to go soon!!!"
821821,Gallie,2013-12-02 22:49:00,1215,Nice fish man. First winter fish always feels good
821854,S.M.05,2013-12-03 02:07:00,145,I prefer minnows for my set line and tipping spoons but with the hike into this lake I took a doz. worms instead to keep the weight down. I know worms for splake??  Burned through the whole doz. on the set line using only the chewed up bits for tipping my spoon.
821855,S.M.05,2013-12-03 02:08:00,145,Rebel Arrowhead spoon - Nailed it dude.
821858,Joeytier,2013-12-03 02:26:00,3990,Worms are killer for splake!!
821874,chris.brock,2013-12-03 06:40:00,4053,"Worms are killer for splake!!  that's cool, I didn't know that  any special way to rig them?"
821937,Joeytier,2013-12-03 19:39:00,3990,"I just hook them once on a small treble for set lines.  Works great.  On a lot of lakes you can ice fish them just like brookies, I find."
821939,limeyangler,2013-12-03 19:50:00,5204,DROOOOOLING!
821954,Moosebunk,2013-12-03 21:29:00,3970,Ahhhhh geeeeeeezus Mikey.    Always crackin' 'em good before anyone else.
822037,Freshtrax,2013-12-04 02:04:00,2215,I might come up near you for New Years again.
