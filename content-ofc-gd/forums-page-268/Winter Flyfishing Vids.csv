820085,Musky or Specks,2013-11-24 23:42:00,2710,I'm already jonesing for open water trout again so I thought I'd share some great flyfishing videos for those looking for entertainment.  
820111,Christopheraaron,2013-11-25 01:43:00,3525,Nice video! Miss those days when it was refreshing to get wet
821186,Musky or Specks,2013-11-29 22:02:00,2710,Nother one that's cool  
821188,Christopheraaron,2013-11-29 22:05:00,3525,"ya we rented that film in the summer, great fishing, but doesn't deserve a film making award."
821287,fish_finder,2013-11-30 14:54:00,370,"Doesn't deserve a film making award?  I'm gonna guess you watched it with your eyes closed.....  That was a breakthrough film as far as fly fishing, and fishing films in general goes.  Seemed fitting that the Fly Fishing Film Tour would give them the award."
821334,Christopheraaron,2013-11-30 17:56:00,3525,"Like I said, amazing fishing and some good camera work, but it doesn't deserve a FILM award. Films should be stories, not just shot after shot of big fish."
821397,Dozer,2013-11-30 22:57:00,896,Its a story about a mouse
821587,Sharkbait22,2013-12-01 17:51:00,297,Looks like a whole lota fun!
821609,manitoubass2,2013-12-01 19:03:00,11391,"Give solopaddler 6-7 gopros and im pretty sure he could tell a story better then an imax film. Still, those vids posted were awesome!!!"
821800,fish_finder,2013-12-02 21:11:00,370,"Like I said, amazing fishing and some good camera work, but it doesn't deserve a FILM award. Films should be stories, not just shot after shot of big fish.  I see what you're getting at, but the award it won was for being voted as best film in the Drake Magazine Fly Fishing Film Competition..."
821802,Christopheraaron,2013-12-02 21:20:00,3525," I see what you're getting at, but the award it won was for being voted as best film in the Drake Magazine Fly Fishing Film Competition... And that was a mistake on their part. Just look at the films in IF4 this year."
821907,fish_finder,2013-12-03 15:11:00,370,And that was a mistake on their part. Just look at the films in IF4 this year.  And I'm sure one of them will take the award this year.  Once In A Blue Moon won the award in 2009.  Different films every year.
821910,Christopheraaron,2013-12-03 15:30:00,3525,"Yup, I'm sure that year it was one of the best, but compared to some of the stuff out now..."
822099,Musky or Specks,2013-12-04 14:49:00,2710,This one is quite possibly the best flyfishing video Ive ever watched . If yoiu can find the full vid I highly recommend it.  
822100,Christopheraaron,2013-12-04 15:05:00,3525,"That was pretty cool! Especially the very end, LOL."
822102,Musky or Specks,2013-12-04 15:16:00,2710,You should see the whole movie
822122,Christopheraaron,2013-12-04 18:06:00,3525,what's it called?
