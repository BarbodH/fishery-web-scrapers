822668,irishfield,2013-12-07 19:20:00,26272,"Well if I had of got out of the hangar.. I would have texted Terry before setting her down... 3"" .. no thanks!"
822669,misfish,2013-12-07 19:23:00,29133,"Well if I had of got out of the hangar.. I would have texted Terry before setting her down... 3"" .. no thanks!   It was a SOLID 3 Wayne.  ."
822671,irishfield,2013-12-07 19:26:00,26272,Oh.. I'd walk on it... no issues there.
822302,NAW,2013-12-05 15:27:00,4022,"   Today is really messing things up.  It's supposed to get pretty warm today.  But the long term forecast looks great!  I'll likely steer clear of the ice this weekend.  But Dec 14, I'm getting my hopes up.  My favorite crappie spot has dicey ice early season...  This is from a few years ago.  This pic always gets me pumped for crappie fishing!!!  "
822306,Raf,2013-12-05 16:01:00,3495,melting off any snow / slush currently sitting atop whatever ice we have right now could be a good thing.

822312,EC1,2013-12-05 17:02:00,930,Problem is that there looks to be quite a bit of snow in the forecast as well. Hope everyone gets out there on the day that they want to safely!
822315,Terry,2013-12-05 17:03:00,14456,I off at 2:30 on the 13th and don't go back till jan 6. So bring on the ice
822317,NAW,2013-12-05 17:08:00,4022,I off at 2:30 on the 13th and don't go back till dec 6. So bring on the ice  Back at Dec 6..  or Jan 6th?  You'll be eating lots of fresh crappie over the holidays by the looks of it!
822319,NAW,2013-12-05 17:11:00,4022,"melting off any snow / slush currently sitting atop whatever ice we have right now could be a good thing.  I agree, it's nice to get ride of the insulation..  But when you only have a few inches of ice to start with.  I don't know what this +12 day it going to do.?  Say we had 4"" last weekend.  Then mild temps this, including +12 day.  Do you guys things it's worth an hour drive up this weekend (Dec 7th) to check my crappie spot?"
822328,Big Cliff,2013-12-05 18:05:00,6899,"The water sitting on top of the ice will be almost at the freezing point. Any temperatures below freezing will cause that to form as ice very quickly. It will also saturate any snow that was on the ice and remove it's insulating qualities so this quick thaw is a really good thing in my books. We did have 7"" of ice in front of my place as of last week, I'll bet we have 8"" by this weekend."
822345,Sinker,2013-12-05 20:06:00,8692,"Yep, this thaw will only help any ice that we have. Now, any lakes that aren't frozen right over might lose some ice.  S."
822347,NAW,2013-12-05 20:15:00,4022,"Man.  It was 13° on lunch..  I just went and grabbed a coffee from Randy's truck, and it feels like -5° with the wind...  That was quick!"
822348,Terry,2013-12-05 20:17:00,14456, Back at Dec 6..  or Jan 6th?  You'll be eating lots of fresh crappie over the holidays by the looks of it! brain fart......................jan 6  lol
822349,misfish,2013-12-05 20:21:00,29133,"brain fart......................jan 6  lol  No,cuz that would be two brain farts in a week. I think it,s called,,,,,,,   GETTING OLD.   Long sticks this weekend for sure. Maybe next weekend on the ice.LOL"
822367,irishfield,2013-12-05 22:16:00,26272,"Was a great day to work in the hangar Nick... I know the sled runs.. the ice auger runs.. the Lund is up off it's tires on the trailer (with no hope of late season Musky.. other than maybe through the ice!)... airplane is ready for back lakes and I found some of my ice gear. Seeing that Terry appears to have a month off... I'd better make sure it's all ready to go.  Hope to get out tomorrow or Saturday for an aerial boot, if the grass freezes white again... and I'll see what changed in the area on the ice front since Tuesday."
822377,NAW,2013-12-05 23:28:00,4022,I your going up.  Snap some shots of my stompin grounds would ya!!
822382,irishfield,2013-12-05 23:40:00,26272,Will do !
822384,Acountdeleted,2013-12-05 23:49:00,2562,-30 here. I'll tell the weather to move east.
822389,davey buoy,2013-12-05 23:54:00,5505,"-30 here. I'll tell the weather to move east. No wonder you want to come back!!,I would of never left lol."
822390,chris.brock,2013-12-06 00:04:00,4053,"yeah, I took a look at the long term forecast too Nick, this weekend will be dicey (but I'm definitely tempted), the following weekend looks promising, nice slabs in your picture"
822393,NAW,2013-12-06 00:13:00,4022,"This weekend will be an advernture for sure.!  But if I can get to the hole, I'll be a very happy man! We'll see what Wayne's re-con mission reveals!"
822634,Big Cliff,2013-12-07 14:24:00,6899,"Well, Sturgeon Lake is frozen over as far as the eye can see from our place. Just saw a coyote out on the lake, looks like it is crossing from somewhere around Cameron and heading toward Pleasent Point area. We see several every year but this is by far the earliest I have ever seen one out on the lake.  This is by far no indication that the ice is safe!!!!! Proceed with caution!"
822647,NAW,2013-12-07 17:10:00,4022,"We only found 3"" to day.  Stayed close to shore.  Spud through ever 4 to 5 feet....  Hoping for another inch or two by next weekend."
822648,misfish,2013-12-07 17:15:00,29133,YUP Still got out. What a winter wonderland today.LOL
