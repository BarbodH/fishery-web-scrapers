822860,GBW,2013-12-08 13:27:00,8460,Ah ok I get it.  I still find it 'not normal' that there is no drain for anything like what just happened.  Maybe when they do all the repairs you can get one added?
822865,Rod Caster,2013-12-08 14:07:00,5784,"That sucks Cliff. I hope you have a low deductible and I hope they restore your basement the way you want it!  You have the same setup as my place, no floor drain. Its unnecessary due to great drainage, but a drain sure can help in the event of a disaster.  I just had an on-going septic back-up issue. We had to rip up our floors the first time it happened. The second and third time we were more aware and caught it quickly. It finally got fixed by my awesome pregnant and resourceful wife who actually dug up the septic lid and called in a pumper truck who FINALLY pulled out a nasty plug...I was in Winnipeg and she couldn't reach any of our guy friends to help.  Anyway, I kind of know what your going through and it's a real burden."
822867,fishnsled,2013-12-08 14:22:00,3520,Well that just sucks Cliff.  Hope it gets sorted out soon and things are back to normal.  On the bright side it will soon be 2014!  Here's to putting all of the crap that 2013 dumped on you behind and bright things ahead!
822894,Big Cliff,2013-12-08 16:20:00,6899,"Well, from the sound of it there is a lot more damage than they thought originally but apparently the insurance will cover it, quite a mess down there though, they have had to cut all the drywall to about 2' up the walls, rip up all the base boards, the doors are all scrap and the carpeting will all have to be replaced. All the door frames are toast, insulation in many areas will have to be replaced. Oh well, Sue wanted the basement painted now I guess I won't have to worry about doing that LOL.  They think they can have everything finished up before Christmas for us though so that is a good thing! I do have to say that Superior Desaster Kleenup have been fantastic to deal with and it turns out that they are approved by State Farm and work with them all the time so they really know what they can do and have to do and that will speed up the whole process.  Rod Caster glad to hear that you got your problem sorted out, septic system problems can be a real pain. We had a whole new field bed put in last year because ours was starting to act up.  Fishnsled that has to be it; year 2013, house# 313, I was born on Jan. 13 this will be our 13th year in this house The tank started leaking on the 6th I didn't find out until the 7th, 6+7= 13  And here I always thought 13 was my lucky number LOL."
822921,Beans,2013-12-08 18:29:00,3339,Sorry about this Cliff...  What about the students ?  Do they have a place to stay until the repairs are done ?
822930,Big Cliff,2013-12-08 18:46:00,6899,"Sorry about this Cliff...  What about the students ?  Do they have a place to stay until the repairs are done ? Yes, they will be fine, we have already taken steps to make sure they are ok."
822932,aplumma,2013-12-08 18:48:00,6896,BTW  I checked on what you did wrong.....NOTHING.  Keep your chin up you will soon be the proud owner of a remodeled and painted basement.   Art
823002,Entropy,2013-12-09 00:11:00,747,"We have 2 floor drains that go to our sump pump.  Beside the pump and a little way down the hole I have a water sensor that is part of a 'Home Sitter'.  Bought it at TSC in Lindsay for about $70.  It calls up to 3 phone numbers and alarms in the house if:  temp goes too high, temp goes too low, power goes out for more than 15 min, or if water touches the sensor.  http://www.homehardware.ca/en/rec/index.htm/Heating-Ventilation-Cooling-Home-Comfort/Heating/Furnace-Parts-Acc/Thermostats-Acc/4-Way-Freeze-Heat-Alarm-Monitor/_/N-ntilv/R-I5570927   It has paid for itself once big time.

823008,irishfield,2013-12-09 00:31:00,26272,"All sorts of things can ruin your day Cliff... but it sounds like you've run the entire gauntlet !!  Floor drain... should be there in the utility room and with mine I also have a P trapped pipe for the A/C condensate drain.. HRV condensate drain.. Humidifier drain etc and a future bar sink. If no floor drain, get that tank blow off plumbed out through the wall in case it ever happens again. Another thing to consider...  I have all of the above and came home to our, thankfully unfinished, basement flooded from end to end last year. The drain on the humidifier plugged up and that little trickle of water feeding it over a week+ made it out of the utility room and formed about 1/2"" of water end to end in the basement ruining a lot of stuff in boxes. The humidifier just happened to be above the one high spot in the floor and while a bit of water made it to the floor drain.. most went under the wall and out into the main room. Once everything was dry... I used Buytlene caulking and sealed the utility room wall to the floor about 1"" up and out.. then formed a bead on the floor in the shape of the doors sweep, with an inch or so clearance to the actual door, about 3/4"" high. Now if it ever happens again... and it won't of course... the water will stay in the utility room and make it to the floor drain (or at least that's the plan!)"

As many of you know I have had my share of bad luck lately. Storm ripped roof off of part of house. Storm dropped big tree on garage. Storm droppd big tree with nice new deer stand. Storme destroyed nice new boat house. Wind storm destroyed  new ice hut.  This morning I got up and went to have a shower, water was SUPER hot. After my shower I decided to go down to the basement to see why. Basement is flooded! apparently my gas valve on my hot water tank has failed causing my reliefe valve to ""relieve"" all over the floor. Carpet is saturated, laminate floor is actually floating, walls are soaked. Everything is a mess! If good begets good I must have done some really bad things in a former life!  And they wonder why drink?  "
822663,aplumma,2013-12-07 19:03:00,6896,Sorry to hear Cliff. Your new heater make sure that the Pressure relief valve is piped to a floor drain. We can also install a water alarm that is available thru amazon if you have any problems finding one give me a holler and I will send you one.   Art
822664,cheaptackle,2013-12-07 19:05:00,849,It's not much of a consolation but at least it's an insurance job Cliff - hope it all works out quick!  Michael

822678,Musky or Specks,2013-12-07 19:49:00,2710,Maybe you've done nothing wrong.Most of your problems seem to be with storms. Have you ever considered that you are a storm god and they keep trying to show their devotion to you?LOL

Reason I ask is I've also got a raised bungalow with a septic system, but I've also got 2 floor drains in the basement that feed into a sewage pump system. One is in the furnace room and the other is in the downstairs bathroom. Any water in there is pumped up to the septic."

No Lew, we have quite a slope to our yard and our field bed is down hill from the house so no pump necessary. I am not sure why there are no floor drains in here other than we have really good natural drainage (except when the water comes from inside the house to start with). Unless the drain had been right beside the tank it wouldn't have helped anyway, everything down stairs is either carpet or laminate flooring."

822858,GBW,2013-12-08 12:58:00,8460,I find it very odd that there is no floor drain by the HW tank / furnace area at all.  Even though you have septic you should still have a drain of some sort going to the sump pump.

Even though you have septic you should still have a drain of some sort going to the sump pump. There is no sump pump. We do not have any problem with water coming into the house from outside. The ground here drops 8' in just under 40' we are built on the side of a hill so there is plenty of natural dranage and it is all gravel. I guess when they built this place no one planned for water coming from the inside.
