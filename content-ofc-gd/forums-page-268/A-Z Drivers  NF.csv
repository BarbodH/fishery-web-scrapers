If anyone is interested, PM me and I'll give you the contact information and you can get your resume in before they even post the job.  No, I don't know what they are paying. Yes, I believe it might require the odd over night run Yes I do believe there could be some US runs. Yes it would be full time  That is all I know at this point. "

Thanks Woodsman, it's usually called a CDL driver here, Commercial Driver's License. I had everything but passengers and tanker endorsements. Drive a potential bomb or throwing passengers off a bus seemed like problems to me. LOL"

821934,aplumma,2013-12-03 19:01:00,6896,I am torn about the shirt it gives me the same feeling I used to get in gym class when I climbed up the rope. Felt good but you know it was wrong place wrong time.lol    Aret
822120,ch312,2013-12-04 17:49:00,1590,"they will pay it but there is a repayment on your taxes a friend did it for his g3/g2 gas licensing the 8 month course was 10,000 and change he had to pay 3400 or so the following year on his taxes  A family member got his AZ about 3-4 years ago and he had to repay nothing for the course. The cost of the course and what trade it's for may have something to do with it.   Totally unrelated, but another method for scoring ""free"" money for employment is the OSEB (Ontario Self Employment Benefit), something many Ontarian's are unaware of. You present your business idea/plan and if selected you receive EI for the year ($17,500 or so) and a free monthly business consultation while being able to earn up to $38,000 or so without having to repay anything. It requires operating your business 100% legit and by the book with proper planning, but the $17k+ and free business consultation every month make it worth it.  Great idea for anyone thinking of starting their own business..."
