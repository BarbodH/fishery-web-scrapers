821507,irishfield,2013-12-01 04:20:00,26272,Spent about 2 hours trying to free up the tail gate latch for an '05 Trailblazer the other day (it's $222.50 for a new one) . Lots of picking at rust.. spraying with rust blaster.. trying lubes etc along with some spring modifying. I had it working about 70% of the time and was about to give up and let my son's gf slam the tailgate a few times if need be..... and then noticed I'd left the can of gun oil on the bench from cleaning up the double barrel a month ago.  One squirt of gun oil... and click.. click... click.. click... it latched every time!  Something for the cranium memory cells for the next time you've got something that typical lubricants won't fix. This gun oil appears to be a miracle lube in a can!

821535,Terry,2013-12-01 13:51:00,14456,good tip
821539,Fisherman,2013-12-01 13:59:00,7201,"Has nothing to do with the brand of the oil or penetrant that the latch quit...    it's a GMC ...Go Make Corrosion. I know, now I'm in for an  kickin.  G96 or CLP if it's stuck and supposed to move without rusting.."

821544,aplumma,2013-12-01 14:18:00,6896,Wayne I keep a bottle of quantum hot sauce a light bearing oil for fishing reels. A few drops of this has saved me many times with frozen mechanisms and locked up nuts and bolts.   Art

821562,irishfield,2013-12-01 16:42:00,26272,"Wayne, lucky you didn't spill that coke , you would have lost the whole assembly. LOL.. I use them cups for everything... but drink coke.. NEVER! (son projectionist at the drive in for the last 18 years...throw away cups are great in the shop)"
821566,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-01 16:46:00,10439,Whale oil.  We use seal oil here.
821567,misfish,2013-12-01 16:48:00,29133," We use seal oil here.  Is that the stuff left in the pan after a good dinner  fry up?  Wayne,bottle caps make good scrapers."

821697,Bernie,2013-12-02 00:34:00,3190,"Lock cylinders have a tendency to corrode as well without being properly lubricated periodically.I have saved a few of them by taking them out and partially apart. Then dip them into muriatic acid for about a minute. Rinse well with water, lightly oil them and they usually work after the first dip. The 6in1 oil that was originally sold by OMC and now by Bombardier has been the best all around lubricant I have found for freeing up latches, and other things."
821884,NANUK,2013-12-03 11:39:00,797,"AD2000 lubricant & corrosion inhibitor by Lloyd works very well,"
821886,DanD,2013-12-03 12:00:00,2223,  This has to be the best product I've ever used; but the distributors have pulled out of Ontario even though the head office is in Vaughan.  Dan.
