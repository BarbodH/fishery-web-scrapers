My kids do live with me Ex but I don't drive anymore so for me to get out it's at least 1 hour walking just to see what it's like out there.  New town, new life, new job but trying to make the best of it. Fishing is like my 'church' is the best way I can describe it."
822240,nancur373,2013-12-05 02:14:00,1211,"My fishing all but stopped after having 4 kids in 5.5 years. A couple of years ago we bought a trailer on Pigeon Lake. It will be good for the ""kids"" we said. It's great...my kids love fishing. It didn't feel right to be on the water all day and leave the wife at the park with all the kids. But lucky for me I take them with me. My 6 and 4 year old boys would kill me if I got up at 5 am to go fishing and didn't wake them. We usually go out at daylight and head back in when the wife texts that breakfast is on. Best thing is I am not the one having to say one more cast. I have to disappoint the boys and head in. Truth be told, I spend more time teaching and observing the boys than wetting a line myself but I love it. Then usually we fish off the dock with all the kids late in the afternoon to the evening and me and one of the boys will go out in the boat now and then and fish till dark. I tell you...if it weren't for the trailer, my fishing wouldn't be 10% of what it is now."

Don't go fishing as much these days bc of family and work but the trips are definitely more epic usually involving travel, overnight stays, good times.  Now I wonder once and a while how many more years will body parts last to keep me out there.   Fishing different ways, in different areas, testing theories, and fishing with new people can make it interesting.  Sometimes I enjoy taking people out just to put them on fish and watch and enjoy the show."

I did manage to do two northern cottage trips for a week each. if it wasn't for those, i couldn't even call myself a fisherman this year.  oh well, 2014 will be a new year. i'm looking forward to getting back in the groove of things."

Still have fond memories of looking down in 10 ft. of water and catching huge perch and pike etc. Lucky; Wife likes fishing as well as my two sons.  We can be found most weekends fishing Simcoe; Kawartha's or Haliburton lakes. Now almost 68 years old and still gong-ho to go fishing. Family caught me sitting  in my portable in the basement.   Tease me about being in the fetal position with my thumb in my mouth waiting for the ice to form.

Beyond what we may think and conceive fish and living matter have their own schedule and may not over indulge as we human do  sometimes letting your eyes and ears abosrb the surroundings is where its truly at"

I got married and had kids and I don't get out nearly as much. Maybe 5 or 6 outings this summer I still love it andit will come back around I think but I'm also okay with it and think that when I do get out now I love it that much more PLUS and it's probably dangerous to mention it here but I'm a golf nut so my two favourite ways to be outside compete in the summer.

We were at a cottage in Muskoka for a week in July and in Kawarthas for a week in September, some days the boat didn't move from the dock. Mojo is fading and other interests have taking its place. Who knows maybe it will come back maybe it won't. Boat up for sale in the Spring."

Feeling like the next day I have off work I'll relax at home, putter around the garage, anything to recharge the batteries so to speak. I need a break!! By Friday I'm chomping at the bit to go fishing! Checking the wind and weather forecast hoping I can get out and cranky if I can't. I'm my own worse enemy. LOL"

Divorced now and fighting a custody battle for 5 years. The lawyers are putting me in the poor house. Hopefully it will all over this spring. The kids love fishing and northern Ontario. I still manage to get out a few times a year (no car - paying the lawyers). I still make my own lures flies and rods. Have done so for well over 50+ years. I usually give these away to friends and neighbours as gifts. Enjoy lurking and reading posts here and since I have very little to add I don't post much. The Leafs thread here really gives me a chuckle as I have been a Bruin fan for well over 55+ years. I really miss the steelhead fishing early in the mornings in the fall and winter. The summer bass and walleye fishing in the summer on my favourite lake is something I have vowed to reclaim once my life gets back on track. I still bike in the summer to my secret fishing hole only 15 minutes away a few times in the summer and I have a ball with some monster walleye. The passion is still there but the resources have dwindled. I love fixing up all my tackle, reading about new gear and methods. I really want to try beads for steelhead next year. That's new for me.  Still love it. Muddler"

Spent my late teens/early 20s targeting musky almost exclusively... During the same time Carp were also a highly targeted species.... I rarely fish either of them now due to the fact I'm addicted to walleye like a fat kid to smarties....  My wife... Kids... And job sometimes effect the amount of time I get out... But they all enjoy fishing and fully support me getting out or coming with me...

822158,aplumma,2013-12-04 21:00:00,6896,Fishing has always been a part of my life. I used to ride my bike to a local farm pond after school and weekends and fish. I joined the Navy SeaBees and did a lot of saltwater fishing. Once out I went back to river fishing and had a chance to start collecting boats and gear. I faded back from fishing to further my career and opened my own Plumbing business. I still fished but it was not near as often as before. I am now able to go on fishing excursions for 2 weeks a year and fish locally with friends once or twice a week. I also find a trip all by myself a good time to relax and unwind with no pressure to produce fish for everyone in the boat.    Art

I don't have a boat but a canoe/shore fishing was good enough. I got married but my wife is cool and that never stopped me. Then I bought house/property and my NEED to fish rushed to the back of my mind like untied cargo during a flight take-off. Other than my strong desire to eat fresh fish as often as possible, which will be fulfilled with high perch limits on Nipissing this winter (easily), I lost my mojo for fishing. A few times I even had my wife ask me to go fishing and I refused so I could cut wood or something.  Anybody else have stories or quips of fishing mood swings and what caused them.

I now live in the heart of the Kawarthas and am only 200' from Clear Lake but hardly ever fish anymore, infact I only fished the Kawarthas 3 times this year, and about the same last year. I spend several weeks a year up on the West Arm of Nippissing chasing bigger muskies but thats about it for me these days.  Times change and so do our interests and for me lately, my interest in fishing has been on a steady decline, infact my last time in the boat was 3 months ago.

Im going to get out a lot more this winter though..ive got the itch to go and work is starting to slow down a little bit so i wont have to work every Saturday.

Not an evening after work kinda angler either, those are usually 4 to 10 hour days on the water averaging out at two or more a week. Working in the ER 3 out of 4 weekends during when most of my friends get their time to do things together, I am at home midweek having completed the 12 hour mixed day and night shifts in 3 days and the kids are gone 8 hours to school.  If it wasn't for fishing the arse would be even bigger from sitting in front of this computer.  The only time motivation is lost, is during and immediately following tough stretches of nightshifts, directly after a long and tiring trip, after too much of one kind of fishing, and during the month of December.  There's much still new around here and plenty yet to explore.  Every day out is an education and exercise.  Health is OK, don't often rely on any need for company, so may as well be out there living to fish."
822045,craigdritchie,2013-12-04 02:46:00,1586,"I used to fish a lot. I worked as a full-time outdoor writer for more than 25 years. Over the course of that time, I fished an average of three or four days each week. Every week. 52 weeks a year. Year after year after year.  Some times I fished five or six days a week. There would be stretches where I would fish every single day for two or three weeks straight. I can't even begin to tell you how many frequent flier miles I racked up in that time, or how many miles I logged behind the wheel of various vehicles driving to and from fishing spots every year. Used to buy monofilament by the case (12 x 3,000 yard spools) and would always burn through a half-dozen cases each year. It's proably safe to say that for more than two decades, the vast majority of my meals were served through drive-through windows. Just ask my ex-wife.  After a couple of decades at that crazy pace, I burned out and didn't touch a rod again for almost five years.  But eventually, the interest in fishing comes back.  I think fishing, like everything in life, is all about balance. Some times, a little break just makes you appreciate it all the more."

I'm usually out every weekend at least once and if weather allows it could be 3-4 trips at 5-8 hours each on Lake Ontario chasing anything chrome as of late.  This fall has been brutal for weather (winds) on the days I could go and nice when I could not go.  A couple of weeks ago my grandfather past away at the age of 93 while down on Quinte.  That would be my last trip of the year. Oddly enough I got my PB just a couple of hours before he passed on.  Coincidence??  Who really knows, he certainly knew of my love for fishing, many have said that it was just a little something to say thanks for I did in recent years for him, not a bad thought.      I think we all go through ups and downs when it comes to fishing.  Could be anyone of a 1000 reasons.  When I give up fishing I might actually get married again....maybe not."

Like others have mentioned I never got out much when my kids where small...maybe half a dozen times a year. Then later on for about 20 years I worked 12 hour shifts and only worked 14 days a month...I fished well over 100 days a year then. Now I probably get out 50 times a year.  I used to be pretty hardcore at chasing chrome...but it doesn't interest me at all now. Haven't had any of that gear out of the basement for 2 full seasons. Now I pretty much focus on panfish and perch.  However I know once I retire I will be fishing more again so who knows what species will be taking up my extra fishing time then.

That number might have changed if I had a tow vehicle. I sold my truck last winter and have yet to replace it. I hope to do that over the winter.  I got into remote control helicopters and that took up a huge amount of time and $$  Plus we had a baby last year.. and that drained my time aswell, but once the boy gets old enough to go fishing, Im sure we will be out more."
