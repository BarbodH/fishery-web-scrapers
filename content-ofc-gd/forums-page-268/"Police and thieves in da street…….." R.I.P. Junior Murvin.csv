The Police too were almost exclusively a reggae inspired band, Blondie also pumped out a few tunes of that ilk. The stuff i loved from the seventies and eighties also inspired the whole Ska, Skinhead, Rudeboy/2Tone fashion/music scenes of my childhood. The group 'Madness' or 'The Specials' would be the mainstream face of those groups. Just a wicked time to have been growing up. In the same schoolyard you would see….Punks, Goths, Numanoids, Rockabillies, Teddy Boys, Psychobillies, Smoothies/Casuals, New Roamantics, Rude Boys, Skinheads, Soul Boys…….boy was it a time of TRIBES!"
