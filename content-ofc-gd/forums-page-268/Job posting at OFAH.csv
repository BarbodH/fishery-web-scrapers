And I do not live in a castle. Sometimes its better to measure twice and cut once if you get my drift.  Yah... was kinda my point 2 days ago.... Food isn't any cheaper on Landsdowne St in Peterborough than it is on Yonge St in Toronto. Rent in the 'boro is about par for a one or two bedroom unit that my daughter is paying at Bloor/Lansdowne in Toronto for her place and the cost of a vehicle / insurance and gas to get out to the 7 bypass for work, same deal. I guess when Dad's paying the bills anyone can live like a king.  Being born in Peterborough Civic myself... I guess he struck a chord with his ""Live like a King up there""!

822111,Richie Razor,2013-12-04 16:06:00,536," You are correct, the cost of certain items are very similar in Toronto and up in Peterborough. Food might be similarity priced, but I can't see the price of car insurance being the same, and we all know from our travels up there that at times, gas is up to .10 (or more)cheaper that in the big smoke.  When comparing the costs of renting vs. the cost of ownership there is absolutely no way you are getting the same living space, dollar for dollar renting in either places - what I mean by that, is the amount of space you can get for the same dollar - a $600/mth room is closet space in downtown TO, while in Peterborough you probably could get an older small detached or a well equipped basement apartment.  When buying a detached home for example, $600k gets you a good sized home in Peterborough, and in Toronto (proper) hardly buys you a parking space lol - avg detached home in Toronto is $800k++, and the average detached home in Peterborough is just under $400k - So if me and my wife gross say $200k a year combined, your darn right I can live like a Royal up there compared to some places in the GTA just on the sheer value I can get for my dollar per sq. ft.  For the job posted on this thread, making 36k a year I'm sure you could get by modestly up in Peterborough, plus your on the door step to tons of fishing and hunting opportunities. And also more often then not, the person isn't the sole income earner in the household, as the wife or girlfriend is also bringing in an income.  I apologize if I ""struck a chord"" with you, but I believe we're were talking about 2 different things.  It's tough out there for the younger generation with all the higher costs living in southern Ontario, but as they say, we all make our own beds to lie in.   Now I hope my IT guy is done Farting around with my laptop!!!"

I live in the boonies  north of Peterboro and while I can't speak for Peterboro proper, I know when I moved here from Toronto 4 years ago my truck insurance dropped 40% which is a darned good savings. And your also correct about the gas prices as their nearly always well below Toronto and today their at around $1.16/litre."
822115,Bernie,2013-12-04 17:27:00,3190,"When I head down to TO I am always amazed how much it costs to even park the truck.I'll stick with my traffic free commute.There are things that cost more up this way too, but to me, the advantages certainly outweigh anything else.  I left a good paying job with benefits back in 1985 when they decided to close their operations in North Bay. They offered me a position in several different cities. I thought about it, visited ones I thought I may be able to live. Barrie was one I almost took, but on the way home I said to my wife that I was going to quit and do something else. She supported my decision. Went back to a minimum wage starting out as an apprentice mechanic. Applied myself hard. within a year I had places calling me to come and work for them. That was cool! For the last 20 years I have operated my own shop. Life is good, but still need to keep at it."
822151,Big Cliff,2013-12-04 20:29:00,6899,"I wonder how many successful people on the board can say that they started at the top right out of school. The only job I know of where you can do that and be successful is a well digger!  I'll bet you none of the guys that have made it for themselves on here sat around waiting for someone to hand them the golden key! We all started at the bottom and worked our way up sometimes a couple of times over in our life. I'll also bet that many of us did it by starting at minimum wage and proving (or improving) ourselves as we went.  As far as living in Peterborough or the Kawarthas; There are plenty of people that live in this area very comfortably on a lot less income than $20.00/hour.  We rent a large two bedroom apartment out to students every year, fireplace, fully furnished, all inclusive and right on the lake for $1100.00 a month. Gas is cheeper, insurance is cheeper, parking is cheeper, and it is a very different lifestyle than you get living in the city. We catch walleye right off the dock in season, have an ice hut that they can use anytime they want (as long as they help maintain it). We can hunt deer, rabbits, partridge and water foul almost right on our property (well, you might have to walk across the road to hunt the deer).  What I am having trouble understanding is why there have been so many posts leaning toward ""give me more, I deserve it""!  There are only two things in this world that will influance how you end up making your life! Do you have a wish bone or a back bone? Either by themselves aren't worth much but (wish for it +work for it) = SUCCESS"

Worked there for 3.5 years, in a union environment, and decided that there had to be more to life than that!

Think the pay with this OFAH job sort of sucks but, in 99 I started with a grad rate of $18.30 hr. yet it meant at that time I would instantly be working, gaining experience and beginning the steady climb up the ladder.  This job offered could be that foot in the door.  The beginning experience.  With many jobs in many fields nowadays not offering up long-term work and much becoming contractual, this is a start.

821720,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-02 02:07:00,2582,Thanks for posting Cliff. A great start for someone indeed.  To all those that think $20/hour is lame. Your lifestyles must really be something I can't imagine. I make marginally more then that and have put 30 plus years in where I work. The wife and I are in  good shape financially and will retire at 55. I would think that a young couple today with both of them making that kind of money starting out would have a real good shot at a decent future for themselves.  Again Cliff thanks for trying to help someone out.

If I wasn't saving to come back to Ontario I wouldn't know what to do with it (probably donate most of it) I have my boat and my car and a roof over my head. That's all I need to be more then happy.  $20 an hour for year round work sounds like more then enough to be able to sustain and go fishing on weekends."

If someone gets a job right out of high school he can be investing and saving at the age of 19. If you spend 5 years and 100,000.oo (easy to do) you will be 10 years behind in time and money from the non college person. By the age of 40 the NCP can have his mortgage paid off 21 years paying only 20% more than the base payment and 21 years in his chosen job. Our college person is 10 years into his mortgage and only 10 years in a company if he had no problems finding the job and paid $20,000.oo a year plus interest to get back to neutral at the age of 30. Both are 40 years old. One has 20 years of blue collar training and has paid for his house and has investments and saving with the real potential to open his own business. The other depending on the field will have 10 years experience at least 10 years of mortgage some savings and a investment account. Guess who gets the business loan? Right the blue collar guy. When people look at college as a money ticket they rarely at the age they make that decision realize the timeline they are embarking on. Most find themselves out of college and heavily in debt with few jobs that can make the kind of money they need to get out of debt in a timely manner. I have nothing against college I think that everyone should make there decision as to what they want out of life. I am a hybrid I took classes as I found the need and interest which adds up to no degree but information that I use everyday. Remember it is not the employers job to pay off your debt he needs to get the best person for the job at the best price for the company.

How students applied and projected themselves during the education process and interview/relationship building process determines whether they get employed.

821564,limeyangler,2013-12-01 16:43:00,5204,"There's a grad somewhere sayin "" Do you want fries with that ?"" that would gladly take the job.  Exactly….meanwhile corporate profits are at the highest levels ever…despite the economy in the $%$# on a global scale."
821565,i2cool2fool,2013-12-01 16:43:00,349,$45K/yr entry level position in Peterborough. That does not actually seem too bad or horrible i suppose. This role could be a great starting point for someone leading to a nice career.  Fresh IT college/undergrads in southern and southwestern Ontario (more expensive markets) range from 45-55K with some exceptions.
821570,Terry,2013-12-01 17:01:00,14456,it's more like $36855.00
821572,leaf4,2013-12-01 17:05:00,2466,and that's gross... you'd be looking at like 30 or less after taxes lol
821574,porkpie,2013-12-01 17:14:00,2521,"In what world. The reality is a lot of university grads, unless they are the holder of a professional degree are taking jobs wherever they can get them.  I agree the salary isn't high, but I wouldn't be so certain of your statements.  I think if I had to choose these days, I might favor college, or a combo of college and university with a co-OP element.   Having a degree isn't the path to good fortune it may once have been."
821575,i2cool2fool,2013-12-01 17:15:00,349,"I stand corrected. I applied rough estimates and assumed 40 hrs/week.  Regardless, are folks thinking this entry level $36855 position in Peterborough is a bad thing? It's not uncommon to bring a new person in as temporary and flip to full time once you know there is the right fit."
821576,bare foot wader,2013-12-01 17:18:00,1354,"sounds completely fair for an entry level position in any company I've worked for, especially reading the job description, doesn't exactly list many skills required   University grad would be way overqualified and would be looking for new work within a month.  ha I'm not sure about that, if you're saying a bachelor degree is overqualified? no way...mba or other advanced degree then yes....I love reading the cover letters of a uni grad, ""I expect to make 80K with my degree and zero experience, I will be available in 4 weeks once I finish exams"" lol"
821584,Sharkbait22,2013-12-01 17:49:00,297,I bet a person with a MSc will get the job.  That's tells you how competitive it is.
821591,Big Cliff,2013-12-01 18:13:00,6899,"Wow, when I posted this I thought I might be letting someone know about an opportunity they might have otherwise missed, I didn't mean to start a ""discussion"" about whether this was a fair wage or not. Quite frankly with the shortage of jobs available in the ""enviromental"" field, I see this as an excellent opportunity for someone to get in and perhaps use this as a stepping stone to building a solid career in this or related fields. OFAH is a solid organization with a long standing history, job security is fairly secure, and it would make a good addition to any resume for related jobs elsewhere. Lord knows this is an area that is going to develop a lot more as we as a society move forward.  I also know that it is a good clean relaxed place to work in a modern facility where accopmlishments are recognized and opportunities are abundent. True, $36,000.00 isn't at the top of the pay scale but I have worked at a lot of jobs that didn't pay anywhere near that amount of money to start. (heck, I have worked in a lot of jobs where the pay was nowhere close to this)  I think it is important to consider that this is a starting salary and $20.00 an hour to start is a lot more than many people make right now. I happen to know one young lady that has a degree in enviromental studies and a deploma in enviromental studies graduated with honers and who would have jumped at the chance to get this opportunity if she wasn't living on the East coast.  Anyway, I hope my posting this has helped to give someone a chance but at least it is out there. I'd love to hear that someone on OFC has started a career in a field that will do something toward protecting and enhansing our enviroment."

I agree the salary isn't high, but I wouldn't be so certain of your statements. I'm a college grad and I say what I'm saying because I see technician and technologist jobs go to university grads all the time because the employers are (and obviously they would) trying to get the most educated people for their money. College grads train for Technician jobs, university grads don't... generally anyway. You are right though, its only fair for anyone to want to get a foot in the door and get experience in their field.  sounds completely fair for an entry level position in any company I've worked for, especially reading the job description, doesn't exactly list many skills required    ha I'm not sure about that, if you're saying a bachelor degree is overqualified? no way...mba or other advanced degree then yes....I love reading the cover letters of a uni grad, ""I expect to make 80K with my degree and zero experience, I will be available in 4 weeks once I finish exams"" lol It's definitly a fair position! I'd love a job like this and in another life I'd apply for it. Re-reading the posting, given the amount of writting/workshop work involved it actually DOES seem more like an entry-level University Grad position or a college grad with relevant experience. I didn't fully read the requirements in the posting; i'M onli a Collage graduite. hahaha.   But anyway,  Cliff is right, this is a great opportunity for whomever!"

I know how bad it is, we had the pleasure of having two very well educated and experienced people with enviromental backgrounds living with us last winter and they had a heck of a time trying to find work in their field.  I hope you do apply for it and it would be wonderful to see a post on here that one of our members got the job! Good luck!"
821620,Acountdeleted,2013-12-01 19:24:00,2562,"Thank you very much Cliff. I have had the pleasure of working with a fantastic guy who used to live in North Bay and did all sorts of environmental work back in the 'good ole days'. I truly believe him when he says environmental work was better back then. He would tell me stories of fish surveys on Sturgeon and Scugog, creel on Nippising, back lake stockings all over the province.  I really hope it returns to that point. Any person on this board I know would love to do work like that, me included."
821626,Richie Razor,2013-12-01 19:42:00,536,"Like I said its a good pay for someone right out of college or university, but really someone with a Msc would actually take such a low paying job?  It's a good wage, and you could like like a king up in Peterborough"
