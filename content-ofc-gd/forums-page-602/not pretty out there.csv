527740,lew,2010-12-12 15:31:00,12766,Been snowing hard over this way since 4:00 AM and sposed to turn to freezing rain later on today.
527741,walleyejack,2010-12-12 15:33:00,358,"Beauty here, the birds are singing,the palm trees swaying,hula girls on the boulevard,what more could one want for. oh wait, that is on tv.  was raining,now nothing,overcast and dull, have to change my meds again"
527742,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-12 15:34:00,2690,"Sloppy mess for sure!!  Look on the bright side Terry, supposed to get cold for the next three days.  Highs of around -6 with lows of -10 or colder down here.  That will get that ice forming!!"
527748,Dondorfish,2010-12-12 15:47:00,1000,Been raining down here  in Niagara since I got up - pretty much all traces of snow now gone - guess i'll go cover the snowmobile back up!
527752,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-12 15:56:00,1622,"About an 1"" of wet & heavy snow here, not going far today, maybe back to the coffee shop, drive careful out there boys & girls Richard"
527756,Carp,2010-12-12 16:06:00,1488,"Raining steady right now here in Mississauga, ON. Not sure when it started, but I've been up since 5am and it was coming down then & hasn't let up since. Doubt it will stop soon. Looks like it may be an all day thing.  Six months from now someone will be complaining about the lack of rainfall & it's too hot to stay under the sun.  Mother nature just can't win !"
527762,Lunker Larry,2010-12-12 16:41:00,122,Rain and freezing rain bouncing off the window as I type this here in Ottawa
527763,toca,2010-12-12 17:12:00,274,you know what i hate the most?  people being tardy.  did a favor and sealed the deal for a specific item its going to be a two hours trip each way.  dont feel like coming home at six pm
527766,Roy,2010-12-12 17:23:00,13728," Just call them ""Re-Tardees""."

527776,irishfield,2010-12-12 17:50:00,26272,"Was a crappy drive to the city... I can tell you that Terry, but nothing like last Tuesday night going home!"
527867,Teressa,2010-12-12 22:42:00,55,"Here in Wahnapitae (close to Sudbury) we are getting hit hard. My daughter has asked me twice already if I think there will be school tomorrow. I don't mind the snow, but the wind is down right nasty. Supposed to be -36 with the windchill tonight. Days like today are when I envy animals that hibernate."
527872,mercman,2010-12-12 22:52:00,7054,Had about 3 in of wet heavy snow.Now its raining and +4. Sposed to get freezing rain tonite. Good news is i finished all my christmas shopping today.
527876,Terry,2010-12-12 22:58:00,14456,snowing like crazy here here in Bradford  I will start my xmas shopping soon
527879,uglyfish,2010-12-12 23:07:00,981,been rainging in hamilton all freakin day. really not happy with that! we had some good ice forming around here and a couple spots i have for early ice fishing were gettin close to being safe! now we gotta start over
527880,misfish,2010-12-12 23:09:00,29133," Seen that on the news Terry. It,s stopped here for now and still mild. The mild temps have packed down the snow."
527908,Leecher,2010-12-13 00:40:00,7832,"Had snow overnight, freezing rain early morning and rain all day and still coming down   temps are 2C"
527912,Rizzo,2010-12-13 00:48:00,4754,snowing in Barrie...although you could say that about 200 days a year and be accurate.
527914,skeeter,2010-12-13 00:50:00,1907,  thats why we love ya Roy!!!!
527918,Bernie,2010-12-13 00:59:00,3190,Got close to a foot of snow here today and still coming down. Nipissing just froze over so this will likely make it a slushy mess.
527919,irishfield,2010-12-13 00:59:00,26272,"Well I hope it just stays wet here in the city.. I found one of the rare spots in TO that you can park all day (other than 4-6pm) without a permit/sticker, but it's also posted ""no stopping snow route""! We've got away with it for a few weeks so far.. saving use big time in parking fees. Hope it stays snow free all winter in TO!!  Snow route only goes into effect if so many inches of snow fall in a certain period"
