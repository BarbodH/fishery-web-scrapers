528231,bushart,2010-12-14 01:17:00,2628,"thanks Jacques,  Now I've got to come up with a new idea"
527101,bushart,2010-12-10 14:38:00,2628,Just a quick question if I may...  I'm currently working on a fly fishing painting  So far I've got my angler underpainted--gonna be in waders in a river  Now my first intent was to have him doing a roll cast with the line hilited through the air  I figured casting was something you were all very proud of..  I wonder now if having a fish busting the surface across the river may be more proper---either way fish or cast it'll be across the stretch of river.  So I guess my question is what do you think depicts fly fishing more?  Oh yeah one more---what's a popular line colour?--Obviously I'm a spin fishing guy
527108,muddler,2010-12-10 14:58:00,623,"Fly lines come in a lot of colours if they are floating lines. White, orange ,green,  yellow and even pink are popular. As to the first question, I like the idea if a cast across the river to the yet unseen trout.  muddler"
527109,DMASSE,2010-12-10 15:05:00,420,"  Fly fishing is an art, and persoanlly as a fly fisherman myself, I like to see the line either on the water or in a perfect loop...  here is a pic of myself in Alberta. I love the way it looks...  I hope this helps    Dave"
527123,bushart,2010-12-10 15:56:00,2628,Thanks all  This is currently where I'm at---lots to go yet---creel looks like a cool idea  
527168,cuzza,2010-12-10 17:57:00,467,"I'm with Dave, a perfect loop is what it's the perfect fly fishing image. One picture that does it for me is from the Movie 'A river runs through it' -it's not perfect form by any means but it captures the essence of fly fishing for me.    As for fly line colour, I don't think it matters really, looking at what you have so far and the fact he's not dressed like a 'modern' fly fisherman, I'd go with a light, drab colour like a beige or light olive green which be closer to the colour of an old silk line."
527178,bushart,2010-12-10 18:11:00,2628,Thanks Cuzza  Actually that's just his shape underpainted---Have'nt really started him yet  River shot is cool too
527179,ctranter,2010-12-10 18:12:00,543,"I like the big wave-like swooping overhead casts with bright, recognizable fly line colours like orange.  If"
527193,solopaddler,2010-12-10 18:42:00,8605,You're asking for an answer to something that's totally subjective.  Paint from the heart and you'll find your answer.
527209,bare foot wader,2010-12-10 19:32:00,1354,"to me, making a perfect cast is a great as catching a fish..."
527229,bushart,2010-12-10 20:57:00,2628,Ok boys don't critique too closely yet  I just laid in some colour---lots to hi-lite yet  Just showing you I went with a yellow/green line---casting  It's also a close up on the subject---more background comin as well  Thanks again  
527236,cuzza,2010-12-10 21:18:00,467,"Like it - if you wanted to make it more accurate, the line should look more like this but smoother (sincere apologies for drawing on your work!!)  "
527241,thatleetboy,2010-12-10 21:27:00,143,"Sorry, I'm a little off topic, not commenting on the painting itself... (which is great btw)  but if you want to see some amazing contemporary images of fly fishing, you gotta check out this website!  http://www.catchmagazine.net/   Lots and lots of inspiration here.    Cheers"
527246,bushart,2010-12-10 21:34:00,2628,Thanks Cuzza---I can change that  Told ya I was'nt a fly fisher---like to be though
527288,Leecher,2010-12-10 23:48:00,7832,Awesome brush work so far Terry Wish I could help you out but I ain't no fly fisher Looking forward to the end results Jacques
527450,bushart,2010-12-11 16:18:00,2628,Think we're gettin there now boys  Just showing you how the cast turned out---back to work now  I'll stop botherin you now---thanks again all  
527455,Spiel,2010-12-11 17:24:00,9065,I wish I could fly cast as well as you paint.
527466,Leecher,2010-12-11 18:26:00,7832, Don't even think about it Keep up the great work Terry Love it Jacques

527728,MJL,2010-12-12 15:06:00,2427,Incredible work Bushart  I love it!
528162,bushart,2010-12-13 20:19:00,2628,"Got it done  24 x 36  gonna call it ""Troutstalker""  "
528165,Twocoda,2010-12-13 20:42:00,4130,"Ive gotta ask...i was just going through your website and noticed the ""originals"" are not for sale....so i guess my questions are ...how many prints do you run off and how much are the prints...Im sure im not the only one wondering so if ya want to post the info in here for others to benefit ..that would be cool...if not ...please feel free to PM me in OFC ...  edit to add>>>>nice job!!!!"
528171,bushart,2010-12-13 21:02:00,2628,I get asked this quite frequently actually.  I took the original pricing off the site as some of the work I have on there is in Galleries and they did'nt feel comfortable. People can e-mail me in case what they're lookin at is'nt in a gallery.  That print pricing just comes with the website and is in the US and I just leave that for people on the web that don't know me---In Canada I use a local printer and the pricing is better.  Anyway I try to avoid the whole sales angle here on the board cause it gets a li'l spammy  I put this on here cause we all have the fishing/hunting and outdoors in common and sometimes it's a break from hockey jabs.  And like in this case the fly guys helped me out.  Thanks Again
528190,Leecher,2010-12-13 22:11:00,7832,Awesome work Terry Love the end results Thanks for sharing Jacques
