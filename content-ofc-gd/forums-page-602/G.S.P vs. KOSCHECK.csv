527661,Terry,2010-12-12 03:01:00,14456,and it has begun
527662,BillM,2010-12-12 03:02:00,17367,"I hope GSP doesn't wrestle him to death like he has his last 4 opponents.  But I'm sure that's exactly the way it will go down.  90% of me doesn't want GSP to lose, but there is that 10% that wants him to lose then come back on fire like he used to fight years ago."
527684,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-12 05:20:00,0,3 rounds deep and it's all gsp so far.
527685,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-12 05:26:00,203,
527687,BUSTER,2010-12-12 05:51:00,1336,GSP WINS
527688,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-12 06:11:00,203,  
527709,Terry,2010-12-12 13:07:00,14456,GSP is great at keeping to a game plan and he kicked Kos arse   but even so GSP could not take him down or keep him down  and neither man were gassed at the end of the fight..they are in great shape  his last 2 fights I thought GSP defended this belt but tonight he fought for his belt...  I didn't think it was a strong card going into the fights  but I have to say every fight was great
527720,bucktail,2010-12-12 14:22:00,1857, Went EXACTLY how I thought it would. Getting a hand on GSP is exceptinally hard. His defence is heads and tails above anyone else in the UFC including Anderson Silva  
527758,ctdd2006,2010-12-12 16:07:00,531,That was a great fight.  GSP was dominant and continues to add to his legacy!  Not even close...but you gotta hand it to KOS because he hung in there tough and that nasty right of his could have come down right up to the final bell....but it didn't!  An all around ass kicking!
527759,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-12 16:18:00,0,A fight I sure wouldnt have paid for. The Prelims were so much more entertaining.
527764,miller,2010-12-12 17:15:00,223,"GSP completely outclassed koscheck again, he couldn't even lay a hand on him. sure put a smile on my face at the end of the night"
527769,misfish,2010-12-12 17:29:00,29133,"That was 5 rounds of pin point shots. He punished him,that was his plan.   Yeah Andy,if the sites didnt get blocked,I wouldnt of paid for it."
527774,EC1,2010-12-12 17:45:00,930,"And koscheck fought like a fish out of water last night!  So which fights did you guys think weren't good? I thought they were all pretty good. Not too many decision finishes, and on the one that did, both were fighting for their life! I did miss the alvez fight though"
527834,BUSTER,2010-12-12 21:26:00,1336,"I dont think it was that great of a fight, props to koscheck for standing 5 rounds with GSP ,,,before you knock koscheck you try that,however Gsp sat back and played Defence,Gsp couldnt hold KOS down on the mat,couldn knock him out, and no attemps really to submit him well not for long anyway.. And GSP made the biggest mistake by not going in for the kill...wonder why?  He must be somewhat affraid of Koscheck...Ive read comments like he kicked his butt, total dominance etc...I say it was fairly even fight... Neither fighter had a great performance it was a JAB festival..GSP did not impress me."
527945,Gerritt,2010-12-13 01:54:00,6129,fyi... replay on Veetle.  G
527972,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-13 03:09:00,0,"Boring fight. Two very weak stand up fighters going toe to toe the entire match. No ground and pound. GSP won because he had the better jab and opened up Koscheck's eye. Koscheck must have poor trainers. If he has such a big right hand, they should have taught him how to set it up. This guy wasn't even throwing any jabs till the middle of the match. By then it was too late. His eye was all swollen. At most, him throwing out the jab would have stopped GSP from throwing his own jabs. Koscheck was eating jabs through out the entire fight, trying to land that right hand."
500701,BUSTER,2010-09-02 00:26:00,1336,"Lets hear it, Lots of people like G.S.P and lot's like KOSCHECK  WHO do you think will win this fight?"
500703,kickingfrog,2010-09-02 00:29:00,8333,The one with the bigger role of nickels in their purse?
500704,Terry,2010-09-02 00:30:00,14456,GSP will win and there will be a canceled kosCHECK
500705,Moosebunk,2010-09-02 00:30:00,3970,GSP.  No contest.   But I've been wrong before.... thinking Lesnar vs Carwin. lol.
500739,Rob,2010-09-02 01:53:00,467, Yeah but he was the closest to pumple Lesnar. Wish the hell he won that fight!  Rob C
500749,Governator,2010-09-02 02:25:00,879,"This bout isn't till December right?   lol...  GSP obv, unless the bettings were so stacked I don't know how anyone would bet against him."
500864,PainInTheBass,2010-09-02 14:39:00,102,GSP beat Koscheck at his own game when he wasn't nearly as focused as he is now.  I don't think Koscheck can throw anything GSP's way that he won't prepare for.  The only chance is for Koscheck to land a lucky shot.  But other legitimate KO artists have not done that since GSP has increased his level of focus while training.
500933,PikeMolester,2010-09-02 18:52:00,428,this isnt even gonna be close
500938,misfish,2010-09-02 19:02:00,29133," pumple ?????????????? What fight were you watching??????????    Get over it,the rest of the world has.   GSP. Enough said."
500941,dobee,2010-09-02 19:24:00,301,"KOS will win via. a GSP DQ!  possibly a illegal knee to a downed opponent.. in other words KOS will pretend to get hit and start his ""OMG THAT HURT"" routine... i dislike koscheck with a passion, i have no respect for someone who pulls that stupid s**t.."
500942,ld17,2010-09-02 19:26:00,319,I personally don't like koscheck.  But that's me.  This fight will be like feeding chum to lure in sharks.  This will be another notch in GSP belt.
500949,muskeybugged,2010-09-02 19:46:00,282,I don't care if GSP loses at 4:59 of round 5.... As long as Koscheck gets the poop kicked out of him the rest of the way.....Koscheck needs a good beat down!
500951,ld17,2010-09-02 19:48:00,319,I'd like to know who the two guys are that voted for koscheck?...lol  Maybe his mom and dad!
500953,Roy,2010-09-02 20:09:00,13728,"Just click on ""show results"" then click on each result and it will show you who voted for what."
500961,BassMan11,2010-09-02 20:49:00,583,GSP...... not even close
526357,BUSTER,2010-12-08 01:12:00,1336,BUMP
526368,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-08 01:48:00,203,"Ohhhhh laa laa GSP baby hehe   :w00t:   Would love to see it!!!! We were supposed to have a big wing ding, shoot some darts, play ping pong & watch that fight but have to go to a 50th birthday party   Oh well, I'll catch it the next day but always better watching it live on tv"
526372,brw,2010-12-08 02:02:00,101,
526373,brw,2010-12-08 02:04:00,101,"As an American, I hope that GSP kicks the ever livin crap out of Koscheck. GSP ='s class. Kos is a tool (I'll keep it clean). Nuf said."
526378,bucktail,2010-12-08 02:13:00,1857,I think the question will be will koschek lay a hand on GSP
526380,Drock6687,2010-12-08 02:30:00,90,My flight leaves tomorrow night with 5 buddys...all of our first times going to montreal...cant wait to be in the bell center and hear how loud it is when GSP enters the arena!
526384,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-08 02:38:00,203,  Lucky.......   Grrrrrrr
526398,Hooked,2010-12-08 04:40:00,891,"I think the fight will go just like the Jon Fitch fight.  However Kos doesn't have a chin like Fitch, Kos will get knocked out!  My guess 2nd round.  Will be good!  Looking forward to the Howard vs Alves fight too."
526399,EC1,2010-12-08 04:54:00,930,This isn't even a question. GSP! Especially when you ask this on a Canadian forum!
526416,Harrison,2010-12-08 12:29:00,2202,Hope GSP dyes KOS' hair a certain colour. Sorry lil harsh but my coffee sucks this morning.
