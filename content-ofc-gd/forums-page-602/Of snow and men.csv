527531,ChrisK,2010-12-11 22:13:00,2772,"I made it to the river today only to find two feet of packed snow on top of my trailer. The idea was to fish for a couple of hours and then tend to my shoveling responsibilities but the fishing part quickly got put to the side when I realized just how much of the white stuff had to be moved off the roof. The hole time I was shoveling on the roof I could here the river flowing by calling me out and believe me it was all I could muster up not to climb down and suit up into my battle fatigues and head to the water. The river was prime and weather was perfect but the clock was ticking away and not in my favor. Carol decided to come out of the cozy warm trailer and take a couple pictures  Didn't even have to wear a coat today  The river did look beautiful,too bad. It will just have to wait until next weekend....   Cheers !!"

527540,irishfield,2010-12-11 22:27:00,26272,Wuz he gonna tie it too... the tree behind him??  Glad I didn't take pics of me installing my new shop chimney from the bucket of the Kabota today!!  Now Chris.. you'd have thought Carol would have taken care of that while you fished....
527541,skeeter,2010-12-11 22:28:00,1907,but if he falls off the roof he will land in a big pile of snow.....
527544,Leecher,2010-12-11 22:34:00,7832,"Chris, the fish will still be there next time around.... just make sure you have all your chores done Man it certainly looks like prime from the third pic Leechman"
527547,Twocoda,2010-12-11 22:41:00,4130,looks like a stretch of the river i used to fish quite frequently when i lived in london...always wanted to know someone with a trailer there so i wouldnt have to walk up and down cardiac hill...
527562,ChrisK,2010-12-11 23:08:00,2772,"No worries Brian. Theres practically no pitch on that roof. Like Skeeter said, If I did fall I'd just land in a big pile of snow Twocoda,now you know somebody that has a trailer there Wayne,I tried to talk her into it but she said if anyone is going fishing today it was going to be her.... Hey Leechman, By next week the water should be coming down by the looks of the forcast so it should be a steelfest for sure."
527565,Leecher,2010-12-11 23:14:00,7832, You da man!!! Looking forward to it
527570,misfish,2010-12-11 23:22:00,29133," Ask yer inssurance company Wayne.  Enough,sry like I said to damper yer post ChrisK."

527667,Joey,2010-12-12 03:14:00,9122,"Looks like a really nice place Chris, summer or winter.  I bet that place is gonna bring you two some really nice times and memories  And that's alot of snow, which I think is gonna be added to tomorrow, so don't put that shovel away"
527693,ChrisK,2010-12-12 10:30:00,2772,"Joey, They are calling for a little more snow this coming week but nothing like we just had so I think going be ok for a bit."
527793,splashhopper,2010-12-12 19:15:00,2931,  Me too Dave..... my buddy Rusty doesn't have his trailer there anymore
528135,Governator,2010-12-13 17:42:00,879,My dad stepped on the ladder coming down the roof clearing the snow 3 years ago.  Ladder slipped out and he landed on the deck and broke his back.  Was in a body cast for 8 months.  Needless to say be careful.
528221,aplumma,2010-12-14 00:10:00,6896,"Step one buy 200,000 btu heater. Step two turn on heater inside of trailer. Step three Bring Carol inside were it is to hot to wear cloths. step Four victory smoke. Step five check roof if still snow bound repeat step 3 and 4.  Just a little tip from your Uncle Arttie "
528276,Twocoda,2010-12-14 03:34:00,4130,i fell off a 40 foot ladder before  ...let me tell ya ....it sure was a stroke of luck that i was only on the second rung
