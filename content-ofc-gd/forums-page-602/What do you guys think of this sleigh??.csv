528108,misfish,2010-12-13 16:33:00,29133,Thats a very good deal IMO. Just load up and go.
528109,troutologist,2010-12-13 16:34:00,951,"They are pretty good, especially for the price.  Costco had them for 164 a while ago, with runners, hitch and cover.  There was a recall last year on the hitch, it was fixed and the hitches should be welded on not screwed on like last year.  Also you may find the mounting screws for the runners a bit short.  I like it and know several others that use them and like them."

It's an easy fix though, just drill a 1/8"" hole through the nut and bolt and install a cotter pin. They are a really decent boggan for the price though."

528207,ctdd2006,2010-12-13 23:04:00,531,thanks for the feedback guys!  Cheers.
528229,Fang,2010-12-14 00:37:00,1330,make sure you get a cover or rig up a snow deflector for the front half. these kick up snow like mad. Had one in our group up in Temagami doing some back lake fishing. Made a big mistake of putting the power auger in that one and by the time we got in the sleigh was full of snow - couldn't see the auger. Took a while to get it started.
