528248,kevin booth,2010-12-14 02:08:00,57,does anybody know if theres ice on rice lake yet and if so how thick?
528302,Curtis,2010-12-14 09:58:00,83,I wouldn't think it would be much more than three or four inches. I live close by and my private lake has about five inches I plan on heading out on her today
528320,Terry,2010-12-14 12:30:00,14456,"3, 4 inches that's good for my skidoo...yeah hoo"
528321,Jer,2010-12-14 12:35:00,1426,...weather like this and it's growing everyday.
528357,Michael_Brown,2010-12-14 14:23:00,411,Hi Terry:  Most would wait until they have at least 6 inches of good ice before running their skidoos on the lake. I did get your sarcasm but thought I would mention the proper ice depth prefered. I know many choose to run on less but they seem to show up in the statistics or you tube each winter.  Rice lake does have some tricky spots due to current in some sections so everyone be careful.  Enjoy your holidays.
528402,Terry,2010-12-14 16:39:00,14456,"without a doubt I was kidding , I wait till there is good ice over the whole lake before I take the skidoo out..............   first baby steps walking out to a few close spots"
