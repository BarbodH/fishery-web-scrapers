528326,Terry,2010-12-14 13:03:00,14456,"we have snow and high winds, not good for making good ice"
528327,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-14 13:08:00,2690," That sucks for Simcoe!!  Don't worry Terry, the ""iceman cometh""!!!"
528331,Terry,2010-12-14 13:31:00,14456,oh yeah..  I hear some people are fishing Virgina beach already  but the beaverton ice all blew away..
528343,sauce,2010-12-14 14:00:00,219,I wonder how far the ice goes out at virginia? Could be very dangerous ice there .Beavertons ice just blew away? Could that happen at virginia?
528347,Terry,2010-12-14 14:04:00,14456,if the wind came from the right direction it could go but virgina ice is ok most times because of how close the island is and the point holds the ice pretty good  but you never know for sure with mother nature
528351,GBW,2010-12-14 14:15:00,8460,all I hear is *braaaapppp fffffttt ffffttt* from Headhunter...
528355,irishfield,2010-12-14 14:19:00,26272,"Won't be much ice forming around our place I hear. Both our other kids couldn't get up our laneway when they came home from work yesterday at 5pm (and Kristal is driving Leah's 4 x 4). Son waded all the way to the house to get the plow truck and then promptly buried it down by the gate.. snow ABOVE the mirrors.. and had to wait for the windows to thaw so he could get them down and climb out same. Next up he called to find out how to get the Kabota running.. and managed so and promptly had it stuck many times as well.. but around 1am he apparently had the laneway passable. Not sure how much snow they really got.. suspect this was mainly a drift situation, but there had to be significant snow fall to create same."
