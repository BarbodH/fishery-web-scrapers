527881,Garry2Rs,2010-12-12 23:19:00,1425,"Hello from sunny Arizona.  The weather here is great, about 85 today.  It might cool off by Christmas, but with a 6 to 8 week winter, how bad can it get?  Glad to hear that the big snow storms have missed you, at least so far.  I guess you know that snow collapsed the roof on the Minnesota Vikings home field...  Buck and I are doing a little trout fishing in a nearby pond and have been out in the boat a few times for bass.  Friday we caught four ""stockers"" in the pond.   We also caught a tiny LMBass while looking for Crappy.   This morning, we went over to the trout-pond again for 90 minutes, but the bite was off.  When we got up, it looked slightly overcast, but by the time we got going, the clouds were gone and it was another ""bluebird"" day.  Since it's not far away, when it didn't workout, we came home to watch football.  Buck had a long play in the water, so he is quite happy.  He's now asleep on the floor, waiting for supper-time...grin.  We think of our friends in Ontario every time we open the freezer. Stay warm! Garry2R's"

527883,ketchenany,2010-12-12 23:26:00,3229,"Nice fish, love the catch and release.  :thumbsup_anim:"
527887,Beans,2010-12-12 23:34:00,3339,Thanks for reminding us what we are missing...  We got about 4 inches of snow up until I had my nap...too dark to see if we got more...  Too wet for the blower I'm thinking...
527891,Joey,2010-12-12 23:40:00,9122,"Very nice Garry, enjoy your trout and warm weather you.........    Looks like you two do enjoy each other's company  Joey"
527893,HTHM,2010-12-12 23:48:00,4082,"There is a good reason they enjoy each others company, one is just slightly smarter than the other...."
527896,ketchenany,2010-12-12 23:53:00,3229, That is why they are sitting in the sun.
527906,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-13 00:37:00,1622,"85 is way too hot for this time of year, but Trout & Bass fishing sure sounds good, keep the Reports coming Richard"

528167,Garry2Rs,2010-12-13 20:48:00,1425," There are hundreds of miles of irrigation canals.  Most have fish in them.  In the larger cities there are parks with ponds for fishing and water play etc.  These ponds generally have bass, and are stocked with Channel Cat's during the 10 hot months.  In the ""winter"" many of these recreation areas are stocked with Rainbows.  There is no carry over because the trout die once the water temperature gets too high.  The pond near my place is out in the desert, and the Osprey catch as many of the trout as the locals, but it's all good fun."
