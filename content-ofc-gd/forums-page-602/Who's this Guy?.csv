528031,Terry,2010-12-13 13:08:00,14456,"dang, you guys are fast"
528035,Fish Farmer,2010-12-13 13:16:00,2234,"Thanks guys, I cleaned my cache and forgot to log on   . I'm having email problems, I can't seem to delete my emails. I've been trying everything. Darn PC's."
528052,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-13 13:46:00,2582,  Get a MAC....I'm totally serious.  I went through 3 PC's always getting viruses and junk on them. Taking them to our IT guy at work at least once a year to clean up/fix. Bought a MAC 4 years ago...not ONE problem since.
528053,BillM,2010-12-13 13:49:00,17367," PC's don't get viruses all by themselves    If you aren't very IT savy, then a Mac is a smart way to go.  But you are going to pay through the nose for it."
528080,Beans,2010-12-13 15:15:00,3339,"   I declare this a ""dead-heat""   "
528105,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-13 16:17:00,2582,"  You are correct...computers DON'T get viruses by themselves. All I'm saying is without changing anyone's usage habits, be they good or bad..or without learning to be more computer savy..which I have absolutely no desire to do... then the MAC is the way to go for folks like me.  At the time it was about a $400 difference for me to upgrade to a MAC. Best $400 I have ever spent when I think of all the frustration I went through over the years with a PC."
