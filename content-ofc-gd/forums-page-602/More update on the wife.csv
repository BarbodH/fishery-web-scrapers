Thanks everyone for their concerns and well wishes, I think we are in for a rough ride, But we will WIN"

525711,misfish,2010-12-06 01:41:00,29133,   Thats the spirit.  Your family is in our prayers along with many others here.
525715,Loonietoon,2010-12-06 01:46:00,1450,Yes Henderson just down the street from our house
525716,irishfield,2010-12-06 01:47:00,26272,"Good luck Kelvin.... One day at a time is what I keep trying to instill in everyone around here. It'll work for you two as well.  Hard to give any Chemo advise as every situation gets a different type and mix... and it appears that many react different to treatment. Jen's been hit pretty hard and darn near bed ridden the last 2 weeks, yet a gent going thru the same routine as her has renovated his entire house during his chemo protocol.  The only thing that you can be sure of.. there is no length of life without the protocol, so keep your head high and support her all the way through. You can have your own personal moments when you're away from her.. driving.. where ever. Trust me, those days come regularily and there's no shame in it.  Also great that it's just next door Kevlin... can't beat that stroke of luck!"
525752,mercman,2010-12-06 02:50:00,7054,"You will win Kelvin. God never gives us more than we can handle,one day at a time. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow,not here.Today is when you concentrate your energy on your wife and yourself. Be strong"
525767,Gregoire,2010-12-06 04:13:00,1397,Good luck. You already have a positive attitude and that is really important.
525773,solopaddler,2010-12-06 10:48:00,8605,Thanks for the update.  The power of positive thinking is an amazing thing.
525774,lew,2010-12-06 10:53:00,12766,"Keep up the positive thoughts Kelvin, were all pulling for your wife."
525787,Chuck Best,2010-12-06 12:28:00,308,"Hey buddy.....I can't say anything that already hasn't been said,....just so you know we're all pulling for her,knowing she will win.....TC....Chuck..."
525792,Joey,2010-12-06 12:48:00,9122,"Yes Kelvin, you will win.  You and your wife keep up the positive attitude and you'll beat this together.  All the best buddy.  Joey"
525796,bigugli,2010-12-06 13:05:00,6138,"As ever, I hope for the best possible outcome for you and your Mrs."
525826,Beans,2010-12-06 14:24:00,3339, Lew said it Kelvin...We're all pulling for both of you...   
525832,Fish4Eyes,2010-12-06 14:41:00,1022," It sure is.  For some reason I suspect you have seen this already but here it goes for those who have not. Rent a documentary called ""The Secret"". It is all about positive thinking and how it plays a huge role in your positive thoughts becoming reality. This goes for everything wealth, health, success, etc. I remember the one example showed a middle aged woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She refused chemo and said that she would let nature takes its course. All she did was watch funny movies/comedies, laugh alot and stay positive. To her suprise, when she had her following screening the doctor asked her what she had done as the tumour had totally cleared."
527818,Loonietoon,2010-12-12 20:13:00,1450,Wife starts chemo on Tuesday Dec 14th for 6-8 hrs then again Dec 21 for 4-6 hrs.. then she will get a break for 2 weeks then blood work to see if it had an effect.. We will win...
527821,irishfield,2010-12-12 20:25:00,26272,"Best of luck Kelvin.. that first ""hook up"" will be the hardest (for both of you). They should get easier with each one. I'll tell you tomorrow night if that's true, as Jen is back in tomorrow 8 am for treatment #2.  Did they install a portacath into your wife's chest or are they doing it with an IV pic?"
527823,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-12-12 20:36:00,160,I wish you and your wife all the best! Hope all goses well!
527827,mercman,2010-12-12 20:48:00,7054,"This is good news Kelvin.Di you know more miracles happen at Christmas time, than anyother time of the year.
