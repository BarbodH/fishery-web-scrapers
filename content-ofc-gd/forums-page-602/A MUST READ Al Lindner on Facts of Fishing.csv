528173,mercman,2010-12-13 21:13:00,7054, Thats priceless Dave !!! Both your show and theirs keep me stoked over the snowy part of the year. Thanks for sharing this little part of fishing history with us and have a Merry Christmas buddy !!!!  Paul
528176,skeeter,2010-12-13 21:18:00,1907,"ok so which episode is the linder family going to be on?? it is only fitting, isnt it?"
528192,misfish,2010-12-13 22:16:00,29133, Like how to catch walleye on lake Simcoe.
528193,Leecher,2010-12-13 22:21:00,7832,Awesome Dave   How cool is that
528217,Cudz,2010-12-13 23:51:00,2652,"I would like to see that one.  It will be called ""Catching Walleye on Simcoe (not by accident)"""
528218,Familyfisherman,2010-12-14 00:00:00,188,"Now that's funny.  Gotta love the Lindner family -- classy, great fisherman, always quick to teach others what they've learned through hard work and time on the water...simply excellent.  For me them being Christians and living their lives to please God and help others just makes them all that much more honourable...  Quite a legacy to live up to Dave!  "
528227,Fang,2010-12-14 00:34:00,1330,number one on my bucket list - fishing/outdoor personality to meet  (seeing I already met Dave - is that sucking up enough!!!)
528262,BillM,2010-12-14 02:45:00,17367,"I could do without all the religious aspects of the show, but other then that I love watching any of the Linders."
528344,GBW,2010-12-14 14:01:00,8460,"Great idea Dann.  Al and Dave in the same boat on a lake in Ontario, COOL!"
528356,bushart,2010-12-14 14:20:00,2628,"People use to laugh at me when I was fishing years ago when Lindners were fairly new on the scene and I was using techniques I learned on his tv show.  I use to say well ""Al says....""  They stopped laughing when they were netting MY fish"
528704,Garnet,2010-12-15 13:29:00,2056,I have the original 1 hr In Fishermen specials from the mid 80's and still watch them every year or 2.  What's new is not! Lot's say Gary Y brought dropshot from Japan.  The Linders have a segment on dropshotting mid 80's and 20 years later it's new.
528874,Lunker777,2010-12-15 21:56:00,866, My 50 yr old uncle was telling me how they used to fish rondeau bay back in the day with drop shots. When i say back in the day i mean when he was a teen ager !
