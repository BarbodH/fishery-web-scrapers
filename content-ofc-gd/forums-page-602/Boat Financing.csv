I'm looking to upsize boats this coming year, and I was curious about what type of financing rates some of you guys have on your boats, and if you got a good deal, who did you go with..  all comments and opinions are welcome.  thanks."
528220,bigbuck,2010-12-14 00:09:00,2449,"You are looking at about 8% or so to finance a used boat. You would probably do better with a secured line of credit if you own your house. If not, an unsecured line of credit might be an option if you qualify for the amount you want to spend."
528223,aplumma,2010-12-14 00:18:00,6896,Might I tempt you with the thought to see how much you can save between now and the spring before deciding to take out a loan? You might find that the amount you save can put you into a  second hand boat with out payments. Boat loans are usually one of the highest loan rates because they are considered a luxury item. Good luck and good thoughts with your decision.   Art

Most dealers will offer financing but always ask who they deal with.Some use hfc or other licensed loan sharks, so always ask.8% sounds about right though for most banks.Put down as much cash as possible.It will be easier to get finance and will reduce payments.Ask yourself what you NEED in a boat and go with that in mind.Good luck"
528293,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-14 05:26:00,10439,Late last winter I bought a used camper from a local dealer and my finance rate through my bank was about 7%.
528618,smally21,2010-12-15 02:31:00,993,i was always taught to finance what you need and buy what you want.  but i have found im much better at making payments than i am at saving.  just wanted to second the secured line of credit its the cheapest money you can borrow and the bank stays out of your purchases. good luck
528798,Old Man,2010-12-15 17:39:00,822,A secured line of credit is the cheapest way to go.
528824,Harrison,2010-12-15 19:18:00,2202," Agreed but very tough for a young man to get.  What ever you do, DO NOT get sucked into the 10 and 15 yr loans.  I know some folks who have and after 5 or 6 years, well, they wish they didn't.  Lets put it that way."
528877,lookinforwalleye,2010-12-15 21:58:00,4399,"  I would hazzard a guess that a lot of those 50-70K Bass boats you see running around have those 25 year amortized loans, what ever floats your boat I guess."
