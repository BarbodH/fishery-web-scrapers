528054,Headhunter,2010-12-13 13:51:00,5703,"Nice dedication there boys! I have experienced the boat freezing to the trailor... we made the drive to Picton and backed the boat into the power wash bay... blasted the bottom of the boat with about $5.00 worth of hot water, dashed back to the launch and viola, we were fishing! We usually lower the flags on our Off shore boards as the weight of the ice won't let them track well. Glad you caught some fish and thanks for the trip down memory lane! HH"
528359,johnnyb,2010-12-14 14:24:00,3413,Unreal...way to go!
528368,Headhunter,2010-12-14 14:49:00,5703,"Here's a pic from a couple of years ago, basically doing the same thing you did... in an effort to get the boat in the water! Four hours of hard work, we finally got on the water just before noon! And after all that effort, we only caught on Pickereye!   HH"

528486,Fish Farmer,2010-12-14 21:41:00,2234,Can't say what my wife said. This is a family site.
528494,Fish Farmer,2010-12-14 21:57:00,2234,"Kinda makes you wonder if it's all worth it.   A friend of mine said you fisherman aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he's a golfer and a Mapleleaf fan  , what can I say"
527240,Fish Farmer,2010-12-10 21:27:00,2234,"First day got to ramp at the ferry and lots of shove ice, someone was there and gave up but we give it a shot and got out but things didn't go smooth. First we broke the ice, backed in then couldn't get the boat off the trailer  , kept backing up and nothing,still stuck  , rocking back and forth and looked down the boat was frozen to the trailer,trailer and boat floating  . Started motor to try and brake boat from trailer, the steering was froze  , OH OH. Back up the ramp. went inside the washroom at the ferry to get hot water to pour on steering cable  . Finely freed up then we tried rocking the boat on the trailer to brake free and crack, were going fishin after 1 hour  . We fished the cement plant to Thompson's Pt. dodging floating ice with the boards  , got to Thompson's and it was froze over  . We caught 2 fish for the day so we packed it in at dark  . Back to the motel for some cold beer, makes me shiver to think  . Next day the whole bay was froze over right to the Ferry launch. Ferry launch was froze solid  . So we went to McFarland's ramp and it was froze in . Now what  , off to Prinyers, looked like it was a go but lots of shove ice, thick 6"" chunks, but we got in. We fished the Reach to the Bat Cave. I caught one just after we set up. then nothing for awhile then we got into a few out deep. Then my buddy's board pull back big time  he had a big fish 32"" man was he happy, we did the Walleye dance in the boat with the high fives, his PB. My other buddy caught a few and lost a couple. Fished till dark then back to the launch, Launch was froze  We had to brake up the chunks to get back in, Finely after rocking and pushing we got to the ramp. My buddy backed the truck down and the trailer tires stayed on top of the ice then broke through, Smash, one taillight gone.  We'll be talking about this trip for awhile. With all our problems we still had a great time  I'm posting pictures form start to finish  Ferry Launch  We broke this out backing in slowly.  Ice patches we fished around with the boards.  Thompson's Pt. froze in.  Next Day at McFarland's launch, froze across to the cement plant. We were trolling here the day before.  Ferry braking ice  Looking down the reach.    Prinyers launch      The planner boards were freezing up. When you brought your lure in the hooks froze to the lure body.  And what we were there for.      This is what the Walleye dance was for "

527247,solopaddler,2010-12-10 21:35:00,8605,"Note to self: If I'm fishing Quinte late in the season, follow fish farmer and wait in line behind him so he can bust up the ice for me.  Nice goin', now that's what I call dedication."
527248,solopaddler,2010-12-10 21:36:00,8605," Screw that, no way."
527280,Leecher,2010-12-10 23:38:00,7832,"Now why didn't you bring the auger and ice rods along Man that is real dedication.... bow down you deserve it Fish Farmer Thanks for sharing your time out on the half frozen, open water with us.... Beauty gold for sure Leechman"
527324,Fish Farmer,2010-12-11 01:13:00,2234,Thanks guys. Just thought I'd post this in case someone was thinking of going down. Shame to waste your gas and time.
527332,vinnimon,2010-12-11 01:23:00,2593,"Determination payed off! If you go back out again, ive got the perfect tool for the ice!"

527391,swiftability,2010-12-11 04:33:00,14,"Thank you very much for the report, FishFarmer! You saved me a day and gas for sure!  Ok, BOQ is over this year for me, good luck everyone!"
527393,Joey,2010-12-11 04:44:00,9122,"Well you all look so warm and toasty out there  Great going Dave, you plugged forward and it payed off.  Hope you don't have too many dings in the boat from the ice  Joey"
527418,Spiel,2010-12-11 13:37:00,9065,I had a long talk with Fish Farmer about the trip over coffee yesterday morning and he knows that I'd call it something other than dedication....
527422,Rod Caster,2010-12-11 13:48:00,5784,Wow! you found that fine line between ice fishing and soft water fishing..
527424,Fish Farmer,2010-12-11 13:57:00,2234,"Thanks Lloyd, I tried some of your tips and it payed off. Went with the braid and fluorocarbon.   Glad to help out Alex, I know I would like some info  on yes or no. I didn't think we were going to get out the last day, it was a struggle  You can call me anything but old   I had something in the fridge for you but someone   didn't show."
527425,Spiel,2010-12-11 14:04:00,9065," Sorry Bud, just didn't work out for me last night as no one was here but me and the dog.   "
527444,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-11 15:37:00,2585,wow crazy to be out there but look at the rewards!  Cheers!
527445,Roy,2010-12-11 15:45:00,13728,"You're one solid dude Dave, but please be careful. Thanks for the great report."
527464,fishhunter,2010-12-11 18:23:00,604,Glad the tips paid off for you. Next year we should hook up and chew the fat when your in picton.
527465,bassnass,2010-12-11 18:25:00,174,"Way to fish free, or die hard!"
527703,Fish Farmer,2010-12-12 12:33:00,2234,"Sure thing Lloyd, we always stay at Picton Harbor Inn. I know a few old boys would like to pick your brain  over a few refreshments Thanks Lloyd"
527705,Billy Bob,2010-12-12 12:52:00,5865,"WOW, your dedication payed off in the end and I'm glad to hear no one got hurt.......  I use to fish Chautauqua Lake in my boat until it froze up.....this was always the best time of the year for massive schooling of walleyes. We vertical jigged them with Sonars and Ice Rapalas....sometimes you would actually snag some.  The last time was mid Dec and I towed the boat up a good steep hill in Cassadaga, NY with just about 1 inch of snow......got up about 1/3 of the way up the hill and my boat and my van started to slide down backwards and jacked knifed....got real lucky and only lost a passenger side tail light on the trailer and a small ding where the transom and starboard side of the boat are riveted together as it hit a guard rail that stopped us from doing serious damage....that's when I decided to count my blessings and no longer boat fish there late in the season."
527787,Carp,2010-12-12 18:57:00,1488,"Nice shooting FF.  I remember breaking ice on Georgian Bay years ago, chasing late season walleye . Ahhh, the memories."
