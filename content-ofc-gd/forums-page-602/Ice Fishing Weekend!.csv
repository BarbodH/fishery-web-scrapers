527504,Cosmos,2010-12-11 20:58:00,588,"Just came back. It was really interesting seminar.  Stoty, thank for spool of Suffix line you gave to me."
527572,Stoty,2010-12-11 23:28:00,2910,"How did you know it was a G2 vehicle?   Is that a good ""interesting"" or a bad ""interesting""?"
527665,Cosmos,2010-12-12 03:11:00,588,"No doubt, it was good for me. Many new things was shown and explained."
527668,Stoty,2010-12-12 03:19:00,2910,Great to hear Cosmos! Grant is one of the most knowledgeable anglers out there right now. I personally have learned so much from him!  Glad you enjoyed it!
527690,ctranter,2010-12-12 08:19:00,543," I dunno, maybe the license plate was a dead give-a-way"
527713,Stoty,2010-12-12 13:26:00,2910,LOL!
527857,Cosmos,2010-12-12 22:07:00,588,"Hi Stoty, Just came back from BassPro - big disappointment for me. I didn't get all those lures you showed us yesterday. It was really bad choice of NorthLand spoons. I still can't understand how come such a big store can't have a bigger varity and quantity. I really like new Rapala rods you showed. I didn't see any of them yet in a BassPro. Those rods look really solid - really nice handle and guides. I hope you will share your experience with us once you test them on the ice. Would be great if you will also tell us where we can buy them. I believe many guys will be happy to get them. Grant is really nice person, after my conversation with him he offered me to fish with him next week. It's amazing. Thank you guys a lot. Your own presentation was also really well done. I got some really good advises which i will try next time i will be fishing for whities and trout."
527871,Stoty,2010-12-12 22:52:00,2910,That's great Cosmos!  Yes.... Bass Pro didn't have a lot of stock with Northland stuff. I was also very disappointed! Thanks for the great feedback on our seminar's! We do our best to try and present things in a way that people will easily understand.
528000,bigugli,2010-12-13 05:00:00,6138,"Nice to have met you. The seminar on dropshotting was quite good. Appreciate the tip. Have to say that, as already mentioned, the selection of Northland gear was poor. As was the selection of other ice jigs."
528042,tknohpy,2010-12-13 13:25:00,162,I like Fishing World in Hamilton for ice fishing...fantastic selection!
