527031,MJL,2010-12-10 03:51:00,2427,"Cheers guys and thanks again for all of your help. It's hard not to have an upbeat and positive attitude when I'm surrounded by people who I'd consider as close to family as I can get  The reports the last few weeks here on OFC and the PM's kept my mind off things. I still have a full bottle of Tylenol 3's waiting to go to the highest bidder   (j/k)  On another note, thinking about it, I'd give my left nut to see the Leafs make the playoffs...Oh wait...   A pair of AngSpecs...1 in a bigger, more ported version of the one I already have, and my dad got an AR model to play around with. My dad bought me a baby 4"" offset a few years ago as a graduation present...I've got to pay for my own one this time  On the bright side, his fishing toys are also mostly mine too  Now I just need to build a new rod to match the reel...  Mike"
527037,Twocoda,2010-12-10 04:04:00,4130,no worries on losing that one Mike it will be hangin there for the rest of your years
527048,young_one,2010-12-10 05:27:00,620,"Hope to see you on the water soon! I just might get to fly fishing this coming, definitely need a good teacher!"
527077,highdrifter,2010-12-10 12:23:00,2534,Yo Mike could you pop open some of them covers and show us some pichures?!?!  Glad to hear you're okay.
527085,solopaddler,2010-12-10 13:37:00,8605,  Can't go wrong with an Anspec.  I'm sure you and your dad will put 'em to good use.
527086,Harrison,2010-12-10 13:41:00,2202,"Good news bud.  Glad everything is ok.  I fish some of the same rivers, maybe I'll run into ya sometime.  I'll look for the guy that leans a little to the left.  Cheers, Phil"
527277,Leecher,2010-12-10 23:24:00,7832,Wonderful news Mike Glad you're on the road to recovery and congrats on landing that new job Looking forward to reading your next report Thanks for the update my friend!!! Tight lines Jacques
527287,spinnerdoc,2010-12-10 23:48:00,556,good on you. what diameter are we talking abour here? well with your skills it'll see a lot of steelhead in no time.
527317,MJL,2010-12-11 00:56:00,2427," 4.5 inches...I was tempted to also get the 20th anniversary model (4.75"") but maybe that might've been excessive"
527319,buckster,2010-12-11 01:06:00,530,  Excessive!   If i had your money i'd burn mine.... lol
527320,denisk,2010-12-11 01:06:00,163,I had the same CT experience     she said it's gonna feel hot and your gonna think you just went to the bathroom.  Glad to hear everything is good seems like just yesterday I was waiting for you to come weight in my last minute carp     Hang in there time flies quick and before you know it a year will have gone by
527323,vinnimon,2010-12-11 01:13:00,2593,Glad to see you back MJ!
527336,craigdritchie,2010-12-11 01:29:00,1586,"Glad to see you're back at it, Mike. Once things warm up a touch, we should sneak off to my secret, pristine steelhead spot so you can give that reel a proper workout.      (and before anyone complains about me giving away their secret spot, c'mon ..... everyone knows about Bronte)"
527354,backbay,2010-12-11 02:05:00,773,"Mike, I haven't been around much, and missed all of this.  Just like they've said, everyone here stands and is pulling for you!"
527355,limeyangler,2010-12-11 02:09:00,5204,Mike..fantastic that your spirits are high.....
527629,spinnerdoc,2010-12-12 01:32:00,556,"ah the 20th, i held that reel at angling specialties and on the water from another angler...sweet reel man....the 4.5 is a sweet reel as well dude"
527686,Dusky,2010-12-12 05:40:00,310,Good going Mike! Glade to hear things working in your favor.
527737,MJL,2010-12-12 15:22:00,2427,"Thanks again guys   Most guys have a little voice that tells them when they shouldn’t spend more money on new tackle...In my case, I don’t...It’s called being single  I was also given some great advice via PM about NEEDING to fish some of the rivers out on Vancouver Island before I get married...I’d NEED new tackle for that too!   Next year, we need marshmallows if you get that peg again...And shots for malaria   That water looks insanely froggy.  I’m not sure the start-up on any ‘pin would be good enough for that stretch.  I haven't fished Bronte in years...It's good to see the crowds have died down"
527940,spinnerdoc,2010-12-13 01:45:00,556,ahh the single life...i wished i was into fishing more when i was single  . maybe then i'd be as good of a fisherman as  you so your angspec is customized esp for you then?
526718,MJL,2010-12-09 03:54:00,2427,"...But OFC was the best medicine I could ask for  It’s been a month since my last fishing report.  As many of you know, I’ve been dealing with some health issues and trucking through them the best I could - Obviously with the support of family, friends, OFC, CAG and the nurses that poked and prodded me at the hospital on a regular basis...It didn’t help that they pointed and giggled though .  I’m still going through various tests to see if the cancer spread to other areas (some of which sucked considering I hate needles). I nearly puked during my CT scan on Friday...I thought I was having hot-flashes when they injected the dye!  Over the last couple of weeks, you’ve wished me well, chatted with me to get my mind off things (mostly fishing related in Tuesday night chats) and kept my spirits up...Many of whom I have never met before, may never meet in person, or knew of prior, sent me PM’s of hope and support (a couple of whom dealt with TC) and for that I can’t thank you enough  The day after my surgery, good friends Victor and Anthony (Frozen Fire) and his girlfriend, Christine brought over a couple books on ice fishing/photography to read and DVDs for me to watch while I was mostly immobilized.  It’s hard to ask for better friends.  My friend’s dad also sent me an old school steelheading book from his library    Spiel also mailed me some amazing reading materials such as the ones below – some of which might be considered collectable dating back to 1978.  I always was, and probably always will be a fishing nerd.  For me I was blown away by Chris’ incredible generosity – It’s not the first time either    I’ve been healing up nicely since the surgery.  4.5 days after the surgery, I slowly limped into a job interview with my portfolio, a dry erase marker and a telescopic pointing stick.  I managed to score a new job that should pay enough for a new spey rod and a steelhead trip to BC...Maybe only one way though . I gotta thank Hammercarp for his support with that  There’s not much I can say or do to fully thank OFC and its members for the help you’ve given me during this time.  I’ll let you guys know how it goes and hopefully if I don’t need additional treatments/procedures, I can hook up with the members I promised I’d fish with before year end.  OFC is simply an amazing community  Mike  And Yes, my dad and I finally spoiled ourselves by ordering a couple new custom centrepins due to arrive in March.  As always, I had to get mine in black"
526720,irishfield,2010-12-09 03:56:00,26272,Good to see your spirits are still HIGH Mike !! Keep the faith and you will prevail !
526722,solopaddler,2010-12-09 04:10:00,8605,Fantastic! Very glad to see you're rebounding.   So what reels did you end up ordering?
526724,Twocoda,2010-12-09 04:24:00,4130,Amen !!! Give yourself a pat on the back too Mike...with out knowing it ...you will be an inspiration to anyone else that has to endure what you have unfortunately have had to..  Cheers to ya !
526725,discophish,2010-12-09 04:40:00,392,"Fishing has the power to heal.  It's the love and passion that we put into this sport which makes it therapeutic to all of us here.  Fishing is a strong bond between staying positive, and the struggles we have in life.  It's just that important, and very evident in this community, and in our own personal lives.  I am happy to hear that you have it working well for you.  Never let go of whats keeping you going Mike.  Good for you."
526728,ctranter,2010-12-09 04:53:00,543,"Mike, I'm sure you know this already, but nothing is more therapteutic than a healthy dose of chrome.  Anytime you are willing, I am ready to get schooled by you.  When ice hits, it might be a different story.  My girlfriend and I (who I routinely share my OFC life with) are extremely happy to hear your positive results.  Maybe when the ice gets safer I can do some of the schooling   . Take care bud"
526731,hammercarp,2010-12-09 05:28:00,964,It is very good to see your words Mike. I let the guys know at CAG that you were out menacing the steelhead.

526767,Spiel,2010-12-09 14:03:00,9065," I believe that's not unusual Mike, I had exactly the same sensation/reaction when done to me (twice), nasty!  You'll be fine, we've still have a yet undetermined date to get together and fish.  In the mean time, chin up and happy reading."
526769,brickNblock,2010-12-09 14:05:00,598,"MJL, You sound great and your news and attitude awesome, an inspiration to many I think-Keep it up Bud!."
