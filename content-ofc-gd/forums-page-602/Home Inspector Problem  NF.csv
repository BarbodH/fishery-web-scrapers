528330,smally21,2010-12-14 13:25:00,993,"my sisters home inspection stated the air conditioner worked but was older and would need replacement. i went to check it out there was no power to the unit, just a rusty old wire cut about 3 feet short of the unit obviously hadnt worked in years.  inspector said must hve been cut since his inspection and, of course, he assumes no liablity for anything that happens. fortunately there is now a fairly comprehensive certification process thru community colleges for these guys of course that doesn't mean the guy you hire is certified or will take the time req'd.  i find it hard to beleive how many of these guys aren't builders or tradesman. IF THERE IS NO LIABLITY ON THESE GUYS THEN THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM TO A GOOD JOB. IF THEY DONT DO A GOOD JOB THEN THERE IS NO POINT IN HAVING THE INSPECTION!!!!  What a shame just another layer added to the already overcomplicated, bloated real estate, banking process."
528332,aplumma,2010-12-14 13:33:00,6896,IF the rules are the same up North as they are down here the home inspector is not liable for his omissions/oversights in a report. He can be held accountable for incorrect statements though but it takes a trip thru the court system to get justice. Most are not pursued unless it is a structural issue that will make the house unlivable or other big ticket items. You should take Roy up on his generous offer and send the report to him for review by a professional.I am sorry to hear that this has happened. I have always wondered how Home Inspectors can obtain more knowledge in the fields of building than the people who work it every day.   Art
528354,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-14 14:19:00,0,"home inspectors are not liable, especially for appliance related problems.  how old was the furnace?  they only have a life of 20-25 years, and it's something the home buyer should be asking.  holmes on homes has a book on home inspections, and that's what i used when i just bought my home.  it was very thorough and even gave me some leverage in the bargaining stage because I was able to point out concerns to the real estate agent."
528367,JohnF,2010-12-14 14:47:00,3494," You called?  Home inspectors have been around for a long time but for the most part they used to be real pros like Carson & Dunlap in Toronto. If our buyers weren't willing to pay the relatively high fees the pros commanded then we suggested that a reputable contractor might be a satisfactory substitute. Of late though it's turned into a kind of cottage industry for folks looking for a new income source and perhaps with a construction related background. I've seen house painters, computer repairmen, real estate salespeople and kids just out of school jump on the bandwagon. Some were better than others. Many bought credibility by operating under a franchise name but I've found that for the most part the colour of their sign has little to do with the quality of the work.  For my own part when our son was buying his first house he asked if he should get a home inspection. I told him not to waste his money, that we could do as well ourselves. Of the 4 houses he's bought so far there have been no nasty surprises. That being said I may be a tad more qualified than the average person with the experience I've had with house problems with many many buyers over my 35 years in the business and more recently my son has learned a lot himself with the extensive renovating he's done to each of his properties. The average person is probably not qualified to recognize problems and potential problems with structures.  As has been said already most home inspectors today include a disclaimer which on the surface gets them off the hook for errors and omissions (screwups and missed problems) but no amount of disclaiming can save them from gross negligence. Unfortunately I've heard that some simply have no kind of insurance for this kind of problem. Of course pursuing them for anything means lawyers and courts and that scares most folks away. The other thing they do is often refuse to even look at appliances including furnaces so they can't be held responsible. Some even refuse to look at electrical systems and limit their inspection to structural issues only. Read the fine print in the contract you sign.  Within their industry there's a move to raise the bar for members (inspectors) but who knows how long that will take or if they'll succeed at all? A client of my son's pays a particular inspector (4 times now in as many years) to drive 60 kms to do their inspections and pays him a premium price as well. I had a good talk with him one day and was impressed with his ethics and high standards. He's one of the members pushing for a raised bar for home inspectors. Of course this is like a lot of service businesses - raise the training standards and up goes the cost of the service. Consumers are determined to get a bargain on everything so naturally they're attracted to the lowest priced service providers which means they'll be getting the lowest quality inspector in most cases. Hopefully one day soon there will be a higher training standard and expectation of competence from the inspectors with a regulated licensing system like that for the insurance and real estate industries. It isn't a perfect solution but it's a start towards consumer protection. Yes, it raises the cost to the consumer but as long as it remains an optional service each has the right to decide for themselves. There has been over the years talk of making a home inspection a requirement for each residential property sale, not unlike the recent brouhaha over a mandatory Energy Audit, but so far that hasn't happened. Cudoes to the regulators for recognizing that it's easy for them to pass consumer protection regs but the attendant costs are often too much of a burden to the average consumer.  So, what did I just say here? Essentially the value of the home inspector is a crap shoot. Some are better than others. If you are determined to get an inspection done then ask around amongst your friends for references and recommendations. For major home systems like furnaces and electrical I would still rely on professionals for an inspection. My advice is to not rely on recommendatons from realtors. We get too many boxes of chocolates and pretty plants dropped off at our offices not to have certain inspectors on our minds. Personally I refuse to recommend a home inspector. At best I'll give a list of a number in the area and suggest that they check out a few of them quickly before they choose one. Of course, certain names will never appear on my lists. What I've noticed lately is that some home inspectors are now adding other billable services to their repertoire like Energy Audits and mold testing. They do their inspection, mention mold or energy conservation issues and then offer their other services for an additional fee. I object to using one paid service to promote others but that's their own little ethical dilemma to ponder.  Sorry I don't have a cut and dried answer but there isn't one. If you want a quality inspection then be prepared to pay for it. Otherwise it's a matter of whether or not you're lucky enough to get one of the new crop of home inspectors who's actually competent. Even then don't expect him/her to cover all the bases or to offer good E&O insurance without a disclaimer for a number of items.  That's my 2 cents worth. JF"
528375,NAW,2010-12-14 15:01:00,4022,"I bought my house a few years back after it passed the home inspection with flying colors.  A month or two later, I get a letter in the mail from the city telling there's an outstanding building permit for my back deck, which never passed the final inspection.  Turns out it's the longest outstanding building permit for a deck in the history of the city of Barrie..  When I started looking into the building codes, it was obvious that the deck was not built to code.  The home inspector passed it with flying colors..  I called the home inspector, and told him I need to drop $2500 to rebuild my entire deck, he said the best he could to was reimburse me the cost of the home inspection.  I called him a week later to get some money out of him, and he totally blew me off..  You can't trust anyone anymore."
528384,bucont,2010-12-14 15:31:00,20,"I think one of the biggest misconception is that John Q Public has, is that they expect a home inspector is a certified Engineer and the report is as such as well. They are not and if anyone thinks for $300 or even $500 your are going to get a certified engineers report on your home you are sadly mistaken.  As far as an open building permit on the deck is concerned, I think you have case on the previous owner not the home inspector. The home inspector does not check to ensure that all is to code or with the town to see if anything is outstanding. In fact I think it is the lawyer that should be checking title, survey and other open issues with the town such as open building permits. The lawyer should have caught this and should help you out for free.  I had a storm sewer issue on a home we bought, the previous owner cut corners when they connected and our lawyer went to town on them. Took them two years to pay us, but they paid us.  The problem with the industry is there is no requirements in Ontario to certified these folks. Today you can work on the line at Ford motor company, tomorrow they close the factory and you are a home inspector. No training, no certification or insurance required, just hang the shingle so to speak."
528409,torco,2010-12-14 16:51:00,656,"I ended up getting a decent inspection from the guy who was recommended by realtor. Now he was a little more expensive and I my realtor is a good honest guy  and this was the guy he uses, 2 years in and no surprises.  Now that said knowing these guys can be a crapshoot, I followed him around during his inspection, hammered away at him with questions as we went.  I also did my own inspection with my father in-law who although is not a trades person has seen quite a bit over the years.  Other things included was that form 220 mentioned above. Plus the home I bought only had a furnace a few years old.  I had a friend who got a poor inspection and has water leakage problem in the basement. I believe he is now legalling going after the seller because they blatantly left out the water leakage issues.  Anyways good luck, It seems these stories are becoming more frequent."

528586,Dutch,2010-12-15 01:02:00,831,"Sorry about your troubles.  The inspector should have provided a written report of their findings.  At the very least, he should have tested the furnace to ensure it was in working order.  If you read the report carefully, there are terms and conditions that basically say they can't be held liable for anything.  Even if they do find a deficiency, they usually reccommend you to hire an expert to come look into it.  If there is a provincial association, perhaps you can complain about the inspector's work, bt I doubt anything would come of it with respect to compensation.  You may want to talk to your lawyer about whether something can be done with the previous owner, but this is not a home inspector issue.  If the furnace was shot, was it not cold in there when you went through the house?  Edit - Just went back and re-read your OP.  Is it the breaker/bare wire that is leading the furnace to not work or is it the furnace itself?  The guy from the gas company is trying to sell a new furnace, hence the comment that the inspector had no clue what was going on.  Sounds like the furnace was working, then quit recently, leading to a service call.  The technician wanted to sell a funance, so blamed the problem on the inspector being incompetant.  What leads the service guy to say it is shot - due to the wiring?  All a HI is required to do is make sure things are working, he probably turned on the furnace and it turned on, so he is done there.  He also noted the breaker issue, it is not his responsibility to determine what the problem causes, just that there's a problem.  Sounds like the guy did the bare minimum, which sucks, but I don't think you can go back on him for anything unfortunately."
528232,Dara,2010-12-14 01:23:00,3052,"last month my daughter was looking to buy a house. She picked one out and the bank said she had to have a home inspection done to get a mortgage.  Well, she got the home inspection done and it noted very little wrong with the place, so she bought it and moved in 2 weeks ago.  I went to help her move in.  The home inspector had noted that in the panel there was a breaker not properly covered. I looked at it and thought...hmmm, this is weird. The breaker was too small for the hole that was opened in the panel for it. It was a 30 amp breaker. What would she need a 30 amp breaker for. It was shut off and this was moving day so i just left it. Walking in the back door from the garage I noticed a thick wire. It came out of metalic sheath from inside the wall and then ran down the door frame. There was a big chunk of black insulation cut out and the copper was showing. I'm thinking  hmmmmlooks like the wire that would be hooked to the 30 amp breaker. Wonder why its bare and the home inspector didn't note it.  Jump ahead to today and I get a phone call from her saying her furnace isn't working. I told her, call a gas company and get it checked out. The guy says, the furnace is shot and there is no way the home inspector shouldn't have picked this out.  I asked her how old the furnace was and she said the home inspector said he couldn't get the panel off to check the year on it.  So, she is without a furnace...this is in North Bay right now and its -20C The gas company gave her 4 electric heaters and said if she gets the furnace from them there will be no charge for the service call. I told her to tell them that she wants to keep the old furnace. I want to look at it and to hold it as evidence for any future problems. Either the gas guy is not being right, or the home inspector is a flake.  Question is, what responsibility do home inspectors have for actually inspecting"
528234,Jigger,2010-12-14 01:30:00,1237,"Tough luck Dara. If the inspector signed off on it, hes on the hook. Don't know exactly who you'd get ahold of at this time, some of the more knowledgeable contractors around here may have an answer for you."
528235,Joey,2010-12-14 01:31:00,9122,"Call a lawyer, tomorrow morning!!  That's my suggestion.  I don't really know what obligations an inspector has, but I would assume that should have been checked.  Joey"
528236,solopaddler,2010-12-14 01:33:00,8605,"I may be corrected on this but I don't think the inspector is liable for anything.  They're one of my biggest pet peeves next to telemarketers and idiot drivers in this province.  3 times I've paid for one and 3 times they were useless idiots.  The guy who ""inspected"" my house this past July looked like Willie Aames from 8 Is Enough, and about 16 yrs old. (Yeah I know I'm aging myself  )  Absolute complete waste of money."
528237,Dara,2010-12-14 01:36:00,3052,Thats what I always figured too solo. She wouldn't have gotten one except the bank made her. I would have made the trip and inspected it myself otherwise.

528241,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-14 01:49:00,0,"Home inspectors....  Biggest farce going if you ask me. If the inspector has zero responsibility, ask the bank to cover the cost.  Gas companies have a trick where they say yer furnace is no good. They then tell you that they have to turn off your gas and leave you helpless until you get them to install a new furnace. Their excuse is usually a cracked heat exchanger and that it's leaking Co2 into your house when it runs. If it's a fairly new furnace it has a co2 sensor and will shut itself down... Call another heating company to do the work."

528243,solopaddler,2010-12-14 01:53:00,8605," Again I could be wrong here, but the only way the previous owner isn't liable is if your offer was condition free."

528246,mercman,2010-12-14 01:59:00,7054,  Good point.The previous owner was most definately aware of the condition of the furnace and unless it was an as is purchase he will have to pay for at least part of the cost.I think you have 90 days.

As it stands now it is a total waste.  I have seen it from both sides: where an Inspector missed something obvious on a friends purchase. also, when my sister was selling her place, one deal fell through because of a negative inspection where the inspector (who just so happens to teach ""home inspection"" at a Community college)speculated and made stuff up and was blatantly wrong.  There was nothing she could do.  No one to confront or challenge the assessment because the Inspector and his company was the property of the buyer.  The illusion of ""Buy with confidence"".

528255,Old Man,2010-12-14 02:24:00,822,"The home inspection industry is full of con artists. Unfortunately there's no regulation in that industry and to take legal action usually would end up costing more than it would be worth. When buying a home, the better thing to do, is to have the previous owners sign a disclosure statement which is a legal document and gives you stronger legal recourse if there are any pre-existing problems. Still not ideal, but better and cheaper than trusting some crooked home inspector."
528266,Twocoda,2010-12-14 02:54:00,4130,The best inspector is a home builder...if the inspector put on his paper that he wasnt able to open the furnace for what ever reason ...im thinking this will clear his liability as he was unable to inspect it so it would have been up to you to bring in a heating contractor for inspection....( very few of these inspectors have a clue as to what a house even looks like)  I am not a home inspector but i have done inspections on the behalf of buyers(friends free of charge) when the vendors were the ones providing the inspection papers...needless to say ...the inspectors are liable to the person that pays them...so if your daughter is the one that payed for the inspection ...she may have legal recourse....you might want to discover why the inspector couldnt open the furnace..apparently it wasnt a problem for the Gas company...(makes you wonder if an inspector should carry a screw driver)  you might want to see if the exposed wire was in his findings in his report because from the sounds of it ( if i read your explanation correctly) ....the wire doesnt meet ESA code ...  Im sure there will be a few gas guys jump on this thread with their beliefs of the products they are installing and selling ...incase the unit has to be exchanged  Best bang for the buck in my mind is Keeprite or Tappan ..very good reliable units with great warranties  If the gas company shut off the gas then he would have deemed the furnace condemned with writing on the unit and his gas number...along with the problems of the unit ...  Sorry your daughter is going through this ...purchasing a home is supposed to be one of the happiest times of a persons life...  a proper home inspection should take roughly 6-8 hours for a small to mid sized house

He even volunteered that he (or his insurance company more likely) is on the hook if something happens in the next year (i think, not positive on timeline)."
528300,fish_fishburn,2010-12-14 07:39:00,1311,"Unfortunately Dara, a home inspection is more for piece of mind then anything. I don't think that there are any minimal requirements as far as training goes to become a home inspector in Ontario. You basically need a ladder and a flashlight and a bit of knowlwdge of the components in a home and your good to go. A home inspection is not a warranty and will be stated in the report. In my area they run 3 or 4 hundred dollars and take an average of 2 to 3 hrs to complete. Now when buying a resale home a more important document to ask for is a Seller Property Information Statement (form 220). This document is filled out buy the seller when he lists the home and is available to any buyer when requested or inquiring about the property. This form is not mandatory either but we use them regularily in the area that I work in. It has all the general questions about the property as well as any enviromental, improvements and structural. They are basically answered yes, no, unknown, or non applicable. Now if a seller blatantly lies about some questions on the S.P.I.S. and problems occur down the roads, you have a much better chance getting compensation from the seller, when you take him to court. When representing buyers it is one of the first things I ask for when we find a home that they are interested in. Some of the answers to the questions on this form will have me investigate more in depth to prevent these unplesant situations for my buyer after posession takes place. Personally I would rather have a furnace and a electrical inspection done buy a certified tradesperson in that field. They at least have a provincial license and will be held accountable. Just remember when buying a resale home, BUYER BEWARE. Hope this helps."
528301,pikehunter,2010-12-14 09:13:00,1659," Also my understanding. I put no faith in theses guys. Went into a house in N. Oakville several years ago, the woman said that her living room wndow glass was fogged up in between the glass. Pull up in front of this large brick home, first think I do is look at the windows from the car while I'm pulling up as always to see what's happening. The living room window's soldier brick sill is laying crumbled in the garden.  I go in and pull back the curtains and there is literaly no drywall beneath the window! The studs, insulation is moldy. ""Miss, you have a little more than a sealed unit failure, the entire window and wall is shot, and this has been going on for a lot longer than a few weeks.""  She says that they just bought the house a couple of months ago. So I ask why didn't they see this then? I mean the sill is laying in your garden, which BTW was nothing but a dirt patch with a tiny shriveled evergreen to one side. Her answer was they had trusted the home inspector's report and there was not a word about that in it.  When I told her to sue him the answer was the fine print stated that they were not responsible for errors, they had no recourse.  Ever since I have had no trust."
