528751,Spiel,2010-12-15 15:42:00,9065,Last day for voting folks.  Mackenzie is now on page 16 for undergraduates.  Many thanks for the support.
500692,mbosh1980,2010-09-02 00:01:00,349,I wrote an email a while back about the voting and finally got a response back. I'll spare the details but they will be looking into it...
500698,purekgw,2010-09-02 00:22:00,585,if it helps her pay for schooling shes got my vote
500745,bigfish1965,2010-09-02 02:15:00,3382,"Okay...after thinking about it and looking at the numbers..it is a certainty that several participants are cheating. The site admins only need to look at the referrer logs to know for sure. Mackenzie...integrity is worth way more than what the site is giving away. If I were in it, I would be asking for a reasonable explanation of the counts and how it jives with math and logic. Without a script or hack, the first several leaders could not have physically come up with those counts in that time span. All that they would have needed to do was include a CAPTCHA entry and it likely would have been fine. Now you know why we keep this site software upgraded!"
500827,mbosh1980,2010-09-02 12:45:00,349,The gist of the message I got back was that the site admin would be examining the voting patterns and eliminating the cheaters.  They are aware fraudulent voting is going on.  They also said a captcha would be in place shortly.
500833,John,2010-09-02 13:07:00,2956,"This is the ""semi-form"" letter that they are sending out..  Thank you for your concern for the integrity of our organization and this scholarship contest.  In this case, it is apparent that fraudulent behavior is occurring.  We had a meeting yesterday about this very thing and you can expect to see a captcha in the coming weeks to prevent whatever unethical methods are occurring. Furthermore, our site-manager will be doing a scan of the votes thus far to see how they are being accumulated.  Those using unethical methods will be eliminated from the contest.  On behalf of the CrossLites organization, I do apologize for any worry or frustration these individuals have caused. Please do not be discouraged from submitting an essay.  Thank you again, The CrossLites Team"
500844,Rich Clemens,2010-09-02 13:45:00,3131,Hopefully they will re-adjust the totals - I'll keep on voting every day.
500882,Tarzan's Jane,2010-09-02 15:18:00,1183,"  Excellent News....I just voted.  She is no longer in the top 10, but ya never know what can happen after the above takes place."

527522,skeeter,2010-12-11 21:41:00,1907,"Wayne,,, they are limited to 1 vote per email address, per day."

527640,crossover,2010-12-12 01:49:00,172,"I don't want to get on anyone's bad side, but isn't it a bit hypocritical to be complaining of other people cheating while you're just one upping this essay without (well a good chunk of you) reading it? IMO the essay contest should be meritocratic and not on who posts on a website with a larger userbase."
527646,Rod Caster,2010-12-12 02:04:00,5784,  You could always start your own essay contest and then you could control who votes..  I voted. Good luck to your daughter!
527647,crossover,2010-12-12 02:07:00,172," If only I had so much money. But if anyone is willing, I could hold one on OFC and have a $20 timmies gift card as a prize.   if i wasnt so cheap "

527731,Bernie,2010-12-12 15:12:00,3190,I hope they get the cheating sorted out Chris.
498407,Big Cliff,2010-08-25 21:10:00,6899, How can an honest person win if that is the way it works
498409,Spiel,2010-08-25 21:18:00,9065,"   Clearly an honest person can't win Cliff and I would ask all those who have been voting to use only valid e-mail addresses, because I will be querying the folks that are running this contest how they monitor for cheating and what they'll do about it.  In the meantime keep voting folks if you believe Mackenzie's essay is worthy and not because I asked. I'd rather see her lose honestly than win by cheating!  Mucho Gracias."
498414,Big Cliff,2010-08-25 21:40:00,6899, Oh I'll keep voting no doubt about it. I would just hate to see her loose to someone that had to cheat! Where is the honor in that?
498430,ehg,2010-08-25 22:34:00,2666," Funny, the leading essays have a heavy 'christian' slant. I'll keep voting for Mackenzie as she wrote the clearest and most understandable piece."

498642,Spiel,2010-08-26 15:08:00,9065, You'd have to be pretty naive to believe the current second place contestant could honestly go up over 9000 votes in the last 24 hours.
498657,Tarzan's Jane,2010-08-26 15:49:00,1183,"I just voted again....have done so every other day or so...but now....I just do not see the point. Clearly something is definitely amiss.  But to write an essay about The Almighty, and then carry on like some of them are (gross amount of votes)....definitely leaves a bad taste.  I wish your daughter much success.  This is just the beginning of many occassions of whip lash that she will encounter in life - truly sad.  Discernment is a life long exercise."

494267,Spiel,2010-08-14 01:06:00,9065,"   Indeed, though I suspect Mackenzie is fighting a losing battle.  Roy and I have watched closely for a few days now and we suspect that voting fraud is rampant in this contest.  Sad when others, many who have written very worthy essays are left falling further and further behind. In the end though honesty and integrity will win the day for those who play by the rules.  "

492295,Spiel,2010-08-07 19:12:00,9065,"My eldest daughter will be off to University this fall and asked me if I would post this here.  I generally don't solicit this type of assistance, but what could I say, what would any parent say.  She (Mackenzie) is a bright kid who has stayed solely focused on her academic career throughout high school at the expense of her social life, not easy to do with all the pressures teens face these days. Also for the last 2 years she has been working evenings after school and 9 hour Saturdays (while maintaining top grades) to help pay her own way through school. She's now found another way to earn some money.  It's an essay contest with a number of prizes to be awarded to those achieving the most votes. What she's hoping to achieve through dad's post here, is votes from the good folks at OFC.  You can view her essay here.....  http://crosslites.co...88e53e4af40468b   and if you believe it worthy of a vote or two, please do. She'll be thrilled!  Apparently you can vote twice a day and it runs till December. I won't pin this but I'll likely bump it back monthly till it's over.  With thanks to all, a loving Dad."
