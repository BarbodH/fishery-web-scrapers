79368,nomadfisher,2007-06-05 01:02:00,20,"Sunday, Jun 3, 07... back to Six Mile Lake, one of my favorites.  Been going there for years, but this time, I tried out a new bay that I had never been to.  Very productive...  I had always found it to be one of the most consitant lakes. There are quite a few areas producing pike and bass.   I got there early evening and cruised around a bit. Hit the bay 'round 7:00pm and noticed in 6 ' of water, large clumps of 'stand up' cabbage weeds.  Tossed in the Mepps Bucktail spinner ( bucktail spinners are probably my favorite pike presentation ) and had my breath taken away with a rapid flash of silver hitting the lure.  They seemed to be very active, and one went crazy when hooked.   After three landed & released with a few miscelaneous missed strikes later, I fooled around with some other baits. These included a 'walk the dog' jointed bait, large plastic jigs and various crank bait. None produced very well, with the large jigs only getting a couple of bass, promply released.   Returning to the bucktail I started a retreive, then let it sink into weed pockets like it was a jig. Following a deft, quick jerk, another pike hit.   I attached a pic of a typical fish. Since I haven't rigged up  a cool camera jig like some of the guys and was fishing alone, the fish is dangling somewhat unceremoniously on the end of the rod.      Also got some pics of a heron fishing .      Nomad"

79418,Rizzo,2007-06-05 01:52:00,4754,"nice report, and I'd agree about 6 mile.  I used to fish there 15 years ago and it was quite reliable at that time too.  Glad to hear it is still producing"
