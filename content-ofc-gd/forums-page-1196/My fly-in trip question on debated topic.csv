84931,ssauvain,2007-06-18 15:22:00,77,I use crystal fireline or power pro on my baitcasters and spinning rods...do I really need fluor leaders???? I have done fly-ins before and usually don't use leaders???? Opinions accepted guys....tanin colored lake where we are going...and fishing is fantastic...walleye mainly occassional northern

84952,tonyb,2007-06-18 16:13:00,1637,Fluoro is unncessary in those waters.  Save your money for Beer! Tony
85014,ssauvain,2007-06-18 17:31:00,77,AMEN Tony...sounds like a plan....maybe splurge and get some spicey V-8 and have a spicey red beer!!
85033,Smokey,2007-06-18 17:54:00,1278,I never use a leader on my main rod for walleyes when on fly in but I do keep a bigger rod with me geared up for pike with a wire leader when I feel like throwing for them. Like was said with the stained water it isn't going to make a big difference.
