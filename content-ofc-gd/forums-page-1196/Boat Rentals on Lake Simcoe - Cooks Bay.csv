84582,007,2007-06-17 02:10:00,537,I'm planning on heading up to Lake Simcoe tomorrow and want to take my wife out in a boat for a bit of cruising and fishing.  Can anyone recommend somewhere to rent a small boat somewhere around Cooks Bay?  Also what am I likely to catch? Perch I presume... but what about anything else?  Thanks 007

84839,hawkeye,2007-06-18 12:02:00,162,Man Harry's getting expensive. Last year it was $50 for 4 hours and the 4 hours started at pre determined times. I would be very careful with those tin cans as they have very little freeboard and swamp easily (that from personal experience)
