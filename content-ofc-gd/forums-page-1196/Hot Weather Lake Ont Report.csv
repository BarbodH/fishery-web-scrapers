84889,Fishmaster,2007-06-18 14:17:00,920,"Hot Weather -  Kings & Bows fishing is still very good on Lake Ontario...fishing deep water -  200 plus depth- running lines at  35 to 80 . Dipsy 80 back on a 3 setting has been taken Bows steady and dipsys on a 1 setting with wire line 200 back with SD has been the ticket for Kings.  This hot weather is setting the lake temps up nice for a awesome summer of fishing Salmon. In a couple more weeks the big  ""Toronto Sun Derby "" starts.  I can't wait to hopefully put one of my clients on a winning fish worth over $40,000 and for a chance to walk home with a Truck ... Sorry for the lack of reports, but i have been very busy on the water ....just got a 40"" boat.  I can not wait, in another week or so I'll be starting to fish Walleye on Lake Erie. If ya wanna hook up look for me on the Net!      "
