It is a very strong running ski. I wash it after every use, and never have let it sit over night in any lake or river. Waxed about 3 to 4 times a year depending upon use.

84547,tizfun,2007-06-16 23:36:00,292,IT'S A SCAM... THOUGHT SO....  I DID A SEARCH ON GOOGLE FOR A 2001 SEADOO GTX AND IT CAME UP IN ALOT OF OTHER SITES...
84552,Northhunter,2007-06-16 23:53:00,214,"Looks like a scam.  When they call a Sea-Doo such things as ""Sky Jet"" and ""Ski Jet"" you have to wonder..."
84577,Daplumma,2007-06-17 01:38:00,1961,Craigslist has tons of scams like this for cars.I like to mess with them and tell them I have a buddy that happens to be in the location where the car is and he can look the car over and pay cash on the spot if it is really in good shape.I sometimes tell them I have tons of frequent flyer miles and recently retired so I would like to look at the vehicle and purchase it on the spot.Somehow they can never meet there to do the exchange.Craigslist has it set up so they dont get your e-mail address so I dont worry about getting spam from them.
