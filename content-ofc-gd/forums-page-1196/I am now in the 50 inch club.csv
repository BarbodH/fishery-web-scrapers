84665,Victor,2007-06-17 15:23:00,1609,beautiful fish! congrats on making the 50 club!  this is one of the biggest we've seen so far this year!
84721,Handlebarz,2007-06-17 21:23:00,3790,thanks for all the great replies  I have a deep finn saver net this year with a big small hole bag that makes it eay to leave the fish in the water and work on the hooks. some of the best $ I spent this year was on the net and cradle then today I had to use the knipex if you dont have these things and you plan to target musky you might want to go get them they are the cats meiow I did with out before but it makes the day alot easier with them.

84448,Handlebarz,2007-06-16 16:16:00,3790,"Thanks to another Black and Orange Cupcake Special I have made it into the 50"" club.Thanks Jef  Heres how she went down today I was out on LSC as usual I had been fishing a couple spots and moved again to see if I could locate something swimming in the shallow sandy bottom so I put on the good o'l CC special and left the rod high so that it was running 1' under the surface heck the sinker was out of the water most of the time so I took my slow drive through the 2 FOW area zigzaging trying to see any spawners non were found so I headed still at the same speed for a weed bed I was no more then 100' into the weeds when this beauty slammed my line it was cood I watched the strike at the end of the rod and had it out of the downeaster before she had time to take drag the fight lasted a few min then into the net she went.  I must say  that I am glad I bought the big finn saver this year it worked great I let her sit in there for 30 sec as I got the camera ready (down east holders work great for nets also on my small boat anyway) I set the camera up hit the button for the timer and whisked her out just intime for a nice shot I actually got me and the fish this time.  I am also glad that I bought the cradle this is the cats meiow for releasing a fish I took a measuer in the cradle and sat with her for 15 min or so until she wanted to go then off she went nice and strong.
