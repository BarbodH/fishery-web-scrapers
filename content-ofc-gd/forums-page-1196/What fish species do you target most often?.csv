84137,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-15 12:55:00,655,"Thanks for bearing with my inferior poll posting skills.  I am attempting to try the poll thing again.  No need to post again here, just vote (unless you fish for the ""other"" species, it would be nice to know what the other species are).  The question.. what are your favourite fish species to target most often?  You can vote for more than one species... if I can get the poll to show up this time that is!  Thanks for your patience.  Aaron"
84140,Spiel,2007-06-15 13:23:00,9065,....Steelhead all the way Aaron followed by anything trout. Whitefish are also tops.
84156,duber,2007-06-15 14:08:00,220,I live on the Bay of Quinte so you know what my vote is.
84158,Roy,2007-06-15 14:23:00,13728,"Aaron, it's interesting to note that so far, you listed them almost exactly in the order of popularity."
84159,tonyb,2007-06-15 14:38:00,1637,Either that or people lose interest after the first 5 clicks
84164,wolfville,2007-06-15 15:01:00,396,"Something is fishy here. So far there are 30 votes and walleye got 17, that should be around 56.6% but it shows up (for me anyway) as 16.xx%."
84170,ccmtcanada,2007-06-15 15:17:00,7971," I believe it's because you can have multiple choices.  In this case, 30 people have voted, but for multiple species.  The %age looks like it's using all the choices and NOT the number of people as the base."
84173,wolfville,2007-06-15 15:21:00,396,"  Ha, like you always say...that makes sense ;-)"
84185,Rizzo,2007-06-15 16:15:00,4754,"its either smallies, or as doogles would call them ""the mighty shoal carp"" (musky) for me.  No time to expand my horizons"
84210,lilkynan,2007-06-15 17:09:00,173,Blondes - Brunettes and Red Heads
84211,Joey,2007-06-15 17:15:00,9122,"Hmf, no pickerel  Joey"
84214,bassmaster4,2007-06-15 17:18:00,801,pike i liek how aggressive they are even though i havent really caught a big one
84235,glen,2007-06-15 18:31:00,2641,Crap  :wacko:     i just figured out i am a bass fisherman.
84255,tonyb,2007-06-15 19:28:00,1637,My Condolences...  Tony
84319,motv8tr,2007-06-15 23:25:00,2587,Can't say I target a specific fish right now.  It pretty much depends on what the person I'm fishing with is after.  Right now I'd be happy with anything....not sure but it seems to me the last fish I caught was at Lakair last year....might have been one small Pike after but that's about it  Maureen
84351,fishindevil,2007-06-16 01:44:00,6254,"Well i guess im a true walleye fisherman first.  ..followed by salmon,and then it doesnt really matter as i will fish for anything,as long as im in a boat im happy,even if i dont catch anything......oh ya and by the way    LAND SUCKS.  .....cheers  keep up the great work aaron..."
84362,Jigger,2007-06-16 02:35:00,1237,"I cut my teeth sm bass fishing and most of my time is spent on smallies. But I've grown to love the toothier side of things and the last couple of years I've devoted more time to pike and muskie. I do want to spend more time fishing largies  this year, don't know what a reaaly big greenback feels like."
84482,Beats,2007-06-16 17:50:00,543,"Ive found from fishing my entire life without a boat that the species that is most readily available to be caught from shore in almost any river or lake is pike.  Bass as well, but bass tend to be in more specific spots (rocky sections, weedy sections), whereas pike can basically be found in areas that are quite deep to hardly an water at all and in areas with no structure to areas full of weeds or timber.  So, like it or not, I would definately say that my most caught/targeted fish for me is for sure pike."
84874,Aaron Shirley,2007-06-18 13:25:00,655,"Thanks for your replies and votes everyone.  This is great information, and one of the many reasons this site is so popular and valuable to all anglers.  OFC is an incredible resource and has such a great community.  Roy, lucky guess     I had an idea it would be close to that order, but didn't know it would be that close!  Thanks again everyone, and good fishing!  Aaron"
84880,tonyb,2007-06-18 13:37:00,1637,Wow! Carp are more popular than Brook Trout
84969,muskymax,2007-06-18 16:38:00,21,"Hey guys I am new to this forum, but I am a huge Musky fanatic.  For some reason the Admin is not letting me yet upload pics or avatar.  But check out this mean Musky.  This fish was caught in the Lake of two mountains in Montreal Canada.  It was 56.5 inches long, 26.5 inches wide and weighed 48 pounds.  http://www.bountyfishing.com/gallery/super-musky"
