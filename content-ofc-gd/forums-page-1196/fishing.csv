85079,fishnsled,2007-06-18 18:49:00,3520," I guess you could hang some baits off of it.  Maybe bettter for putting some plastics and worms.  Thoses hooks might hanging a bit too low and could cause damage where you don't want it, if you know what I mean."

84626,Terry,2007-06-17 11:01:00,14456,"I have been fishing the kawarthas lately walleye fishing has been slow but the muskie fishing has been great  well great for the people I have been fishing with, I haven't been catching too many I didn't get his permission to post  picture     went to scugog, I always get walleye there.nope dead carp everywhere and no fish    Saturday we hit a kawartha lake.We trolled we threw jigs in the weeds we casted crank baits and nothing I put on a worm harness and we trolled and the walleye started biting and bitting ..it was a great day on the water..when I ran out of worms I tried plastic worms but that didn't work..switched to crank baits and only caught one more fish  so find weeds slow troll a worm harness catch fish..sounds easy to me     sometimes going old school is the only way to get them               I'm sure that's enough pictures..but there are more"
