This year I have changed gears into being a little more hardcore, trying to get out every weekend at least.  Anyway, this has led me to pay more attention to how I am rigging up my presentation.  I noticed (thanks to this forum) that many use flourocarbon leaders for pike and walleye fishing.  Does this apply for pretty much everything including bass?  I use power pro line and am worried that tying it directly to a jig head, or tying a hook and worm right onto it might not be the best idea.  So for each of the following would you suggest using a flouro leader or just tying right onto the braid?  1)  jig (flipping or jig with a plastic on it) 2)  finnesse worms 3)  spinner baits 4)  crankbaits 5)  live bait  Also, for the cases where leaders are used do you tie the leader directly to the braid or do you put a snap on the braid and a loop on the end of the leader?  This week i'll be getting rigged up for this coming weekend, so looking for some pointers!  Thanks! Evan"

Braids/superlines are great with cranks, SB's and Jigs cause you can rip em through weeds and the bass dont seem to mind the braids... i udually tie my leader directly to my braid with a U to U or a Blood knot..."

84831,Blake,2007-06-18 10:58:00,418,Hey Evan hope all is well.  My recomendations are always tie direct but for your examples above go with:  1) jig (flipping or jig with a plastic on it) - Tie direct and braid in 30++ willl be fine 2) finnesse worms - floro in 10-14lb test try the new Gamma 3) spinner baits - in weeds 30 lb braid open water 12 lb Gamma copolymer 4) crankbaits - you know which one I use for this 5) live bait - floro in 6- 10lb but you don't need to use live bait for bass.
