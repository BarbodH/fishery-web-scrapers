84853,blue pickeral,2007-06-18 12:47:00,267,I was wondering why some people would buy a boat with a shorter transom as opposed to one with a taller transom. (short shaft verses long shaft motors) Is there an advantage to the lower transom in terms of being able to fish over it? Would appreciate some opinions as may buy a new boat soon. (maybe) Thanks!

If you are buying a complete package, boat and motor you are better off with the long, at least for me it was the best option.  If you are using a motor you already have that will dictate the transom length... In other words, you gotta short one you're stuck with a short one."
