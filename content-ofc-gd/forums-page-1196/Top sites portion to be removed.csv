It has become a target for spam bots and the spammers are faster than the script writers in working around fixes that come out. This results in quite a mess and unfortunately means we will have to pull the software. You may have noticed that Bent Rods website has also removed theirs (same reason and plus the bandwidth usage is too high for the traffic it generates). Members of topsite will be sent an email prior to the removal of the script."
