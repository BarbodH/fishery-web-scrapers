84710,Dutch,2007-06-17 20:05:00,831,Seems to be in the 101-104 range.
84711,SBCregal,2007-06-17 20:10:00,688,you can check www.ontariogasprices.com   its a user updated site so it may not be exactly current...but it'll give you an idea.
84712,mart,2007-06-17 20:12:00,93,Thanks Dutch..  I've got to fill the boat/truck (170 litres) and just wanted to know the difference in price from here in town(104 also). Thanks again....
84714,Dutch,2007-06-17 20:36:00,831,Get a CT Options Mastercard.  That many litres will net you a ton of CT money....
