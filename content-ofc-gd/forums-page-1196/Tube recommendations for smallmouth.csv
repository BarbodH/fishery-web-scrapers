Thanks"

Green pumpkin a dark green is a standard color, so is a brown color, I like to mix in white with glitter, a baitfish color for starters. LOL I carry a lot of them and a mix of colors.  Rigging, if the water is open, not much around but rock I go with a tube jig insert, hook is exposed better percentage of hookups. Weeds, junk, slop, Tex-posed, with a pegged slip sinker. In the evening, nite or early morning hours I will work close in to the shallows for them, but daytime usually means deeper water.  They like crawfish, but it is not the only thing for them to eat and I think they eat baitfish because of the supply available most of the time. Rocky bottomed areas, points, deeper weed edges wood in deep water if you can find any are good places to probe. They will wander and they will school tightly, a cast outside of the schooling area might not get a hit.  A fun fish to look for and too catch. Just me but in most cases I like a 3 1/2 inch tube."

84528,Beans,2007-06-16 20:34:00,3339,"Phenix 2 1/2 inch salted, smoke colored tubes are my favorite...Smallies think they're candy...  Drag 'em along bottom...swim 'em like a minnow...or fish 'em under a float...  They caught me four 5 lb smallies and one 4 lb smallie one day in Rice Lake a few years ago when they first came out..."
84538,Mark Kulik,2007-06-16 21:13:00,348,"on Sincoe , Mizmo tubes in the new 31/2""  or 4"" work great, smoke colors work best for me, but color can be a prsonal matter, watermelons and green pumpkin also work well."

84780,Guest lundboy,2007-06-18 01:59:00,0,Thanks for the input everyone....  I will pickup a few new tubes in the suggested size and colours and start tubing!  Hopefully I'll have some nice SMs to post in a few weeks when season opens.
