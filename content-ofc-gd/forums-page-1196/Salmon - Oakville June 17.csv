Machine doesn't work. Not a soul at 5am but me....started fishing by 5:30am and got the first King at 6am on my new dipsy 150' back on # 3 in 175fow. 15 Lbs and gave good fight. Just two more boats in the area. Went East to the cement plant and back tried anything between 80 and 195 fow.  It was cool in the morning...was dressed light breezy and cloudy...start feeling good about 10am when the sun finally showed up. Got a second small King -3 Lbs on purple spoon 45' down in 115 fow. And got out by 11:30am. Not super but it was OK for trying a new area/launch. The other boats around me didn't seem to use the net at all. Time to get some sleep as I got only 3 Hrs sleep per night for the last two. Simcoe and now Oakville. It was nice weekend though.  Here are few pictures. The big one:    Release:    And the small one that will go to the BBQ tonight:    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
