84835,Randy,2007-06-18 11:37:00,115,Spend the morning of Father's Day on Lake Ontario salmon fishing off of Bluffer's Park. Surface water temps were in the mid to high 50's and we worked the 20 to 60' depths in 100 to 200 FOW. We caught a 15 lb chinook off the dipsey on a spin doctor and fly combo.    We also caught a small rainbow off of spoons.    Great way to sped a Father's Day.
