First time out in my new boat so it was difficult not to have a good time.  Had two on fishing the hump one on a board and the other on the long line.  My father caught a 39"" muskie in 15fow out from the Thames.  We were going through a weed bed and just as the weeds were thinning out it hit.  My fathers largest fish so he was happy and so was I.  He just comes along for the ride really but he has fun.  He was using a perch shad.  I had also dropped my speed down to 3mph.  Stayed at the Belle River Yacht Club and it was great.  Perfect for a bunch of guys going fishing.  Rooms were clean and its right on the Belle River.  If your doing the family thing though Deerbrook is better.  I'm thinking of going back in Sept. or Oct."
