Whenever I am out fishing people stop and ask if I have caught anything, when I tell them yes - they usually want to see it - which assumes I have kept it, and they are surprised when I say I put them back.  There seems to be a philosophy of catch and keep/eat rather than fishing for the sport/enjoyment.  I know I come from England where it is all catch n release and here in Canada there is a history of eating what you catch but I was just curious as to what today's angler does and whether Catch n Release is getting more popular or not.  I hope I have done the poll thing correctly - otherwise the multiple choice answers to the question would have been:  100% Catch n Release Mostly Catch n Release but occasionally eat a fish caught Target certain fish for eating and put others back 100% Fish to Eat - keep everything within the regs limits  cheers 007"

I may keep a few small fish but only specific species, and I never eat bass.  I have never fully understood why people like to keep those rare moster size fish... I get more satisfaction from seeing them swim away than killing it to eat."
