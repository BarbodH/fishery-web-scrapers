Went to Elora the other day to try for some trout, usually i catch fish but the water was really really shallow and the fish were spooked really easy. I cought 2 of them and lost 2 more. BOth fish were caught on a silver mepps size 0. Its my frist time posting pics and i hope they come out alright.   "
