84404,motv8tr,2007-06-16 09:00:00,2587,"Now that's one heck of a fish there, Mikem your son sure doesn't look too impressed though  Maureen"
84432,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-16 14:18:00,1351,theres been some pretty huge rock basses being pulled out this year it seems to me...
84433,Guest lundboy,2007-06-16 14:18:00,0,It's unbelievable!  I was pulling in a bunch of 1.5lb to 2lb rockbass like this 2 weeks ago off the Gilford shore.  Must have had 15+ of them.  Bent my UL rod almost in half!
84438,gussser,2007-06-16 15:05:00,85,"Caught 2lb 2oz one in Pa. 2 weeks ago.  Must be due to Global Warming. I read that it produces a longer ""growing season"" for bass-sunfish species."
84441,MJL,2007-06-16 15:13:00,2427,"I remember catching a nice one last year with DSN.  The carp weren't biting and I didn't have a light spinning rod, so I took a spool of 8lb line I had with me and tied on a fly that DSN had in his pocket (muddler minnow).  Jigged the fly a little off the side of the dock and a monster rock bass took it.  He measured 10.5 inches in length and it was my biggest rock bass ever.      The live release record is 11.75 inches in length and 11 inches in girth.  The provincial record is 3lbs according to the Canadian Sport-fishing web-site under Fish Registry"
84442,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-16 15:18:00,1351,i entered a 12inch rock bass for the OFC tourney.. 
84474,Kev,2007-06-16 17:09:00,54,"Man those are alot of nice rockbass. I'm sure those put up quite a fight, must have been fun."
84480,bassmaster4,2007-06-16 17:44:00,801,those are some honkin wgsf's
84484,Beats,2007-06-16 17:56:00,543,"Those are massive for rock bass.  Ive only ever caught them by chance while fishing for other fish, but they will hit anything that they can just ambush quickly and return to their hiding spot."
84515,ch312,2007-06-16 19:44:00,1590, i think that rockbass put up a huge fight for their small size. now imagine if they grew to 15-20lbs. not THAT would be one hell of a fight
84551,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-16 23:44:00,2585,wow those are huge rock bass.  cheers!
84568,Rich,2007-06-17 01:09:00,3927,"I've caught WGSF up to and over 2lbs on Long Point Bay. It's like the greatest WGSF fishery in the world, which in turn makes it the greatest fishery in the world, since we all know Rock Bass are kings of the waterways."
84579,chilli,2007-06-17 01:56:00,199,I thought it was a smally too! Then I noticed the dinosaurs behind him and thought I better click the picture to make it bigger  It's amazing how big they fel coming in too. They turn sideways to fight. Smart fish  Dan
84613,Badger Shark,2007-06-17 06:19:00,291,We have caught huge rock bass like that in Otter lake near Smiths Falls.  We couldnt believe the size of them.  I dont mind catching them when they are that big.
84789,John Bacon,2007-06-18 02:11:00,3277,"I have read that the Ontario (and in fact world record) rock bass was a 3 pounder from the York River.  I fish Baptiste Lake (which drains into the York River) regularily.  The biggest I have caught was about 11"" though."
84851,Patches,2007-06-18 12:46:00,48,"My son took this last week, I've entered it for a OFAH award (he'll be surprised when it arrives) "
