84370,jjcanoe,2007-06-16 03:08:00,744,Heading out to Wildwood near St. Mary's and just wondering if the pike are still biting and if so where.  I owe the little guy a fishing trip since I couldn't come thruogh for him last Sunday when his little sister was unexpectedly born so I figured I'll take the boat out there tomorrow with him.  Thanks  jjcanoe
84371,Canuck2fan,2007-06-16 03:13:00,1444,I haven't been there in about 3 weeks so I don't know about how they are biting. Generally though if you really want to get pike there all you have to do is just take some minnows under a float near the weeds along the shore lines and you should do alright. Spinners and x-rap work for some people from what I hear.
84373,jjcanoe,2007-06-16 03:17:00,744,Yeah I used to use minnows set on the bottom right on the dam years ago when I used to fish there a lot.  Tons of snags but also tons of pike. Do they still have that bait shop across the road from the park entrance?  jjcanoe
84443,SlowPoke,2007-06-16 15:27:00,2984,"What time are you going JJ? I might take my girls up there tomorrow and give the boat a good run before Lakair. I home today, working on the VHF and other assorted marine electronics.... drop in if you have some running around to do. -Brian"
84595,jjcanoe,2007-06-17 03:05:00,744,"Missed ya Brian,  Ended up not getting there until about 1:30 pm and was back home at 6:15 $17.50 for a day use pass for a car and boat  which really took me by suprise  (most expensive boat launch ever!)  jjcanoe"
84611,SlowPoke,2007-06-17 05:21:00,2984,"Yikes, $17.50! Is wildwood included in the PP pass for $70?  OOOOPS! I thought you were heading out Sunday.... I was in the boat all day saturday (in the driveway). Since I can't catch anything on the water I've decided to leave the boat in the driveway and vvrrrrroooom noise.... saving a bundle on gas! -Brian"
84677,Carmen,2007-06-17 15:50:00,72,How did you end up doing jj?
84678,Carmen,2007-06-17 15:52:00,72,"Sorry jj, just saw your report further down the board."
