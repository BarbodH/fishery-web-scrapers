84575,graftongal,2007-06-17 01:36:00,145,"We got onto a good trolling run for our pike. We trolled along the rock points and the shoreline that joined the different points. Pretty much every pass we did we were onto a fish over 40"". The fish we got were around 5 to 8 feet of water. Our hot baits were Johnson silver spoons tipped with a white salted grub. Most of our walleye were caught on eyeball jigs and white Power Minnows."
84885,Whopper,2007-06-18 14:00:00,2174,Thanks for the compliment Sandy. It was great to spend a week with good people at a great place.  Kinda of funny though the one evening I could see the flash from the photo shoot but couldn't see your boat.  Tell the big guy that I have not forgot the offer.  Thanks for sharing  Whopper
84915,TJQ,2007-06-18 15:03:00,7806," Great report Snady!!  -  Man those are some nice fish, I have a feeling that Adam was too busy with the camera to actually catch any...  The Johnson silver minnow with the grub worked very well fro us at Kesagami as well.. I have some underwater footage coming that shows it at work... when you see it youll realize why!!"
84930,Big Cliff,2007-06-18 15:20:00,6899,"Beautiful pictures, excellent post! Thanks for sharing!"
85006,snag,2007-06-18 17:15:00,1932,That was great!  I've got to get up there!  Thanks
85059,Kirk,2007-06-18 18:18:00,347,"Its obvious the men are catching the big ones and being gentlemen, allow the women to pose with the fish for the camera."
85061,ccmtcanada,2007-06-18 18:20:00,7971,WOW!!! Those are some awesome Pike!  You beat my PB in every single one of them...LOL.  Thanks for the great report and pics....
85063,Terry,2007-06-18 18:21:00,14456,wow   yeah that says it all...wow
85066,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-18 18:28:00,0,Those are some really nice pike.I just wonder how many times those pike have been caught and released in that lake.  Maybe thats why they are difficult to catch casting and as the other guy was saying that the lodge owners were encouraging the guests to use a minnow and bober(which is a shame).  Nevertheless those are real Trophy Pike and the catch of a lifetime. And I hear the pickeral fishing is exceptional also.
85103,fishnsled,2007-06-18 19:48:00,3520,INCREDIBLE!!!  Great report and some awesome pictures.  I'll be happy to get into one that big on my trip this coming weekend.  Congrats and thanks for the post.
84281,graftongal,2007-06-15 21:04:00,145,"A few weeks back Reefhawg and I had the pleasure of staying for a week at Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermillion Lake. I would have posted the report sooner but I have barely found time to breathe since we got back.  We were fortunate enough to meet up with Tennesseguy, Whopper and two of their good friends. It was a pleasure to be able to chat with them and share stories throughout the week. What a great bunch of guys!     Hopefully we can meet up again sometime, and don't forget Adam's offer for November...  Anyways... the weather was not the most pleasant experience of the whole trip. We woke to snow two days of the trip, quite the change from the smog alert days we were having back home before leaving! Cold and overcast skies made for some tough fishing for the first couple of days until we figured out a pattern. Once we got our technique down there was no stopping us!  Here are some of my pictures, Adam's will have to remain a mystery for all of you (or y'all as they say in Tennessee) oldtimers  that know who I'm talking about!              These pike were like nothing I've seen before. Now I've caught a musky or two in my day, but the heads on these fish were unreal. Just gigantic, bigger than most of the big muskies I've caught. I can't wait to get back there after they've packed on a bit of weight throughout the summer. Hopefully one day very soon!  The walleye fishing was also very good. We never came home with an empty stringer when we went out looking for a meal.  The lodge that we stayed at was awesome. The accommodations were superb and the staff was friendly and helpful. Not to mention that the owner, Brett, was a great guy. It was a great experience and I hope to be back again one day."
84285,tjsa,2007-06-15 21:19:00,1578,"Geez!!!!! Darned near wore out the sole of my shoe tapping it on the floor,  Excellent Sandy, despite the weather.  And, I am envious, not of the fish(I guess they're OK for pike, lol), but because you and Adam got to meet Whopper and TennesseeGuy.  Thanks for the report.  p.s. Why no pics of Adam holding fish??????"
84289,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-15 21:25:00,957,"No pictures of Adam with fish because Adam is huge and makes big fish appear little in photos.  What's this y'all stuff?  I even wear shoes in the summer.  Nice job Sandy.  You did well under really nasty fishing conditions.  East wind is not the prevailing wind in that section of NW Ontario, but East is what you got."
84291,Roy,2007-06-15 21:31:00,13728,"Beautiful Snady, just Beautiful! And the fish are pretty decent too! Glad you had a good time and the lodge was all that you wanted. Meeting Connie is on my list of 50 things to do before I die....dang near the top too!  Thanks for taking the time to post  such a great report......you're the bestest.  ps. Try to find a little time to show Adam how to post his pics ok?  Thanks :-)"
84298,graftongal,2007-06-15 22:06:00,145,"Connie got it bang on. Adam doesn't like his pictures posted because some expert will put in his ""no cents"" worth that the size of the fish is exaggerated. Not worth it!  And Roy, it is a good thing you've got that on your list! Connie is a GREAT guy, and even better person!  And I had met Phil before this trip at Lakair last year. Thankfully I got to spend more time chatting with him this time around. A great guy as well, and one hell of a pasta chef!"
84305,Clampet,2007-06-15 22:30:00,1947,"Well worth the wait! Finally some Pike that look big in the photos. You can tell the pics haven't been photoshoped, everything looks natural and orderly."
84307,fishdawg,2007-06-15 22:40:00,912,thanks for sharing Snady  ... hoping all all is well with the 3 of ya

84325,Rich Clemens,2007-06-16 00:20:00,3131,Thone are some beautiful pike.  Bet they put up a wee bit of a fight.   Thanks for sharing your trip.

84337,solopaddler,2007-06-16 01:02:00,8605,"Sounds like an amazing trip! Just out of curiosity, do any of you guys know if you can get a connection to Red Lake flying out of Pearson or Hamilton? I know you guys drove, but just thought maybe you'd looked into it....  cheers,  Mike"
84338,TangerineDream,2007-06-16 01:14:00,47,Sweet Pike... Makes me long for them in Manitoba lol.... Nice to see someone who appreciates them for the great fish they are. And yes the heads are large. Very healthy. Good work.
84345,Marty,2007-06-16 01:26:00,873,"We all know Sandy is 4'6""and 81 lbs.   Those pike are small.  Seriously, way to go Sandy.  You did good.   Tell the big guy I said hi."
84359,bassmaster4,2007-06-16 02:28:00,801,dang now if only i could get one that big
84361,Kev,2007-06-16 02:34:00,54,Wow   those are some awesome pike!!  Sounds like alot of fun.
84364,Jen,2007-06-16 02:42:00,833,"Wow Sandy, those pike truly are amazing... looks like you had a great time.  Thank you for sharing  Cheers,  Jen"
84369,Greencoachdog,2007-06-16 03:03:00,8163,"Most excellent report and pics!!!... ans as said many times before, those are some excellent Pike!!!  Who cares what Mr. No Cents (Sense) has to say?... anybody that has met the ""Reef"" before knows his stature, I personally would like to see Adams fish.  Uness of course the REAL story is that you ""strapped his butt"" and he didn't catch anything!!!   (kinda like what my wife does to me  )  Whopper is a pretty good guy for an ol' Buckeye  , and I would like to meet the TG one of these days... may have to make a little detour the next time I'm in Tenn. visiting my folks!"
84422,mepps,2007-06-16 12:28:00,1301,great job!  We were finding all our fish in lees the 8 feet of water - majority in 2-3 feet of depth...how bout you guys?
84424,Spiel,2007-06-16 12:50:00,9065,....Holy Humungous Batman.......ah mean Snady. Fantaxtic!
84430,Moosebunk,2007-06-16 14:12:00,3970,Superb Sandy.... and Adam.  Tough conditions out there and you picked up some really great fish.  Sharing any secret baits that put the monsters in your boat???
84446,Guest mistyriver1,2007-06-16 16:11:00,0,"Nice report Sandy, congrats to you and Adam."
84457,Carmen,2007-06-16 16:38:00,72,"Those are some nice gators, well done"
84519,John Glynn,2007-06-16 19:48:00,25,"Great fish Sandy and Adam. We just got back from there on Thursday after a five day trip . We will be posting a report very shortly. The fishing was good. Clive ,we also caught all our fish shallow. Most were in 3 feet of water. I was surprised how good the fishing is there considering all the pressure it gets. Brett was great. Great service. A report will be following."
84543,Dano,2007-06-16 22:41:00,719,"Yea, how'd you get the pike?"
