352220,Roy,2009-06-15 18:15:00,13728,"Yeah, thanks for that Charles."
352241,charlesn,2009-06-15 19:27:00,551,"No problem, unfortunately don't have a lot of details to share with you. Ted called me once he found out he was the winner (he had some boat issues after the conclusion of the event - so it wasn't until much later that they even knew they had won).  They won by 1"" over the nearest competitor is all I know.  Him and Chonger have been close to winning in the past, so they were super happy to finally take it down.  Sounds like it was a fun event."
