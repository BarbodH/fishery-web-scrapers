I was wondering if anyone on the board is familiar with the lake.  What can I expect at this time of year? I am sure the lake has Walleye (slot size), bass, pike, perch. Specific locations, techniques on the lake would be awesome. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks  Mario"

This is what I have found out in the last week or so,  Look for the big shoal in the middle of the lake... Bottom bounce worm harness's for Walleys after dark ... Bottom bounce leaches in 20-30' for Walleys .... (All-Day) Reel large body baits or float large minnows in small coves 5-10' as the sun is coming up for ""BIG"" Pike.  Since the lake is a finger lake it will have deep drop off's everywhere ... I found a hyrographical (Topo) for the lake at > anglersatlas.com <  Good Luck !  Doug"
351969,mistaredone,2009-06-14 22:00:00,913,good luck on the lake guys. That map from anglers atlas sucks!  Although it's not the most complex of lakes you can still get turned around and that map is real general.  Spend the money and get a better map.

Try floating a minnow below a float. There is a bait shop right at the dam.It has been about 12 years or so since I have been there,so make sure you check the regs."
352051,scuro2,2009-06-15 03:02:00,904,"I fish it a few times a year. Walleye are smaller and you got to work for them. Fair bit of fishing pressure, you will see boats out there. Temper expectations, target pike or bass and you should do okay."
