350365,Jackie,2009-06-09 22:20:00,124,"I am planning a canoe camping trip to Byers Lake in Algonquin this summer.  Has any of you fished there before?  What kind of species would I expect to find there?  I will pass through Kingscote Lake and Big Rock Lake, but probably won't have a lot of time to fish them.  And I might fish the nearby waters like Branch Lake and the river leading to it.  Any fishing related info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Jackie"

352131,Jackie,2009-06-15 13:32:00,124,"Thx a lot for the link, Nemo.  The maps are very detailed and they look good.  I gather that Byers Lake should have brook trout, but no bass or laker.  Any suggestion as to what to use for lure, and what water depth to try.  My first guess would be to use small spinners or spoons in shallow water like 10 feet first thing in the morning or just before dark (or before the mosquitoes come in).  Am I on the right track?  Any pointer would be greatly appreciated as I have never targeted brookie before, especially in Algonquin (when I need to pack light)."
352155,Nemo,2009-06-15 15:16:00,727,Small spinners and EGB's. See Doug's report on Wawa speckles.  If you can try some live worms on the spinners and try to fish the wood.  Crank baits wouls also be useful.  Nemo
