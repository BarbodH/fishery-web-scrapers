We will be camping at the main Mazinaw campground (Sawmill).  I don't plan on doing any hardcore fishing but I figure I'll squeeze in 5-7 hours in the AM and maybe a bit of PM too. Should I concentrate on those narrows, which are conveniently close to where we're camping? Is the another location to key in on? It's such a big lake (especially in a canoe)..  I should mention that I will focus on walleye and pike... maybe lakers too as I do have the gear to troll with..  Thanks very much in advance! "

352439,siwash,2009-06-16 10:44:00,683,thanks... i'd imagine that i will inadvertently hook into spawning smallies at those narrows... looks rocky from the pics.. guess it'd be hard to avoid that   i will post a report and hopefully a pic of a fish or two!!
