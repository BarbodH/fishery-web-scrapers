I hear a lot of people using the 5200 but i was on 3M website and reading about both the 3M 5200 and 3M 4000 can anyone tell me the difference and witch one i should be using to seal rivets below the water line on a painted hull. here is the info  3M™ Marine Adhesive Sealant 5200, White, 3 oz White, one-part, greater than 99% solids urethane sealant that chemically cures when exposed to moisture. 3M Id : XS-0414-1186-8  Additional Information  It forms a rubbery, extremely strong, waterproof seal or bond, is non-shrinking and offers exceptional resistance to weathering.

This might help or hurt you depending on the surface angle. If flat, it may seep into the gaps. On the other hand, it may flow away from the gaps depending on the angle."
