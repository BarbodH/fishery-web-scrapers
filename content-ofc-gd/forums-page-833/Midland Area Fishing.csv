I have been told theres lots of good fishing there but don't know where abouts to go ...Are the rivers better or would we have better luck in the bays? I've been having a hard time finding info on fishing there as well as renting canoe's (2) or a small boat for a smaller lake. Any info would be awesome, thanks alot.  Luke W"
