Although we boated alot of nice fish the 1st 3 weeks of the season the action was still not where it should be credit to the cooler water temps and low weed growth. On the other hand the action the past couple of weeks has been nothing short of amazing on a variety of Kawartha lakes we have been out on. In fact, the past couple of trips we boated like 30 Walleye's each trip!!! Small perch coloured crankbaits worked parallel to deeper weedlines and and various jig colour combinations have been just crushing the fish. Most of the bigger fish (4lbs + have come on the crank's) but plastic minnow bodies and twisters in smoke, black, white colours with 1/4'oz darter and ball heads in Chartreuse, white, black and pink have been taking huge numbers of fish. Working different colour combinations is the best approach as the fish definatey show a preference of colour on one lake over another and even more so depending on weather conditions.... sun, wind and cloud are big factors that have you make a minor change to colour and have the fish start hammering the jig again after the action has slowed down. When things slow down experiment to find the 'BEST' combination for the lake/conditions.  Attached is a couple of pics of some really nice fish including one of a 12yr old son and father.  On that trip the kid caught his 1st Walleye ever (in fact a few of them) and you could not wipe the smile off his face all day!!!... check it out.   After a great day on the water..... still smil'n....    My 17yr old with a nice Sturgeon Lake Walleye he caught and released on a early evening trip after school...   A nice 24"" Balsam lake beauti that I got and released a few days ago....    Get out there and enjoy the action and remember to be safe out there.  Good Fish'n Greg."

352300,Roninramirez,2009-06-15 23:04:00,19,"Great post Greg,  We were out on Rice on Saturday. It was a slow day, conditions were very flat and hot. Tried the deeper weed lines with 4' husky jerks, but it only produce one 2-3lbs that we lost at the boat. Around 2pm the fishing was slow so we switched to drop-shotting worms and had lots of success but nothing big.  Had better days on Rice.  Tight Lines"
