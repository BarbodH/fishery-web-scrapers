So I'm just a little curious to see if any of you have any record fish, either lake records, species specific, international etc...I'm not going to expect a full thread full of responses but am just a little curious to see what some of you may of caught. I remember in the winter somebody on here caught what they thought was a record ling(correct me if im wrong) through the ice, so for me that's all i know about.  Thanks and lets see some giants.(or record small fish if you want  )    MTBF  *Edit-Does anybody know a site on lake records for things like bass, pike, perch etc or are lake specific records more a local thing?"
352362,Terry,2009-06-16 01:30:00,14456,I caught a CD once but never a record
352363,POLLIWOGG,2009-06-16 01:34:00,835,"Caught a 4 lb herring and then read about somebody setting a record with a 4 lb herring, Doh!"
352502,ranger520vx,2009-06-16 15:03:00,164,I've been lucky to hold National Live Release Records for Brown Trout and Atlantic Salmon both caught in 1991 that are certified by National Fish Registry.  
352503,BillM,2009-06-16 15:08:00,17367,"I caught a monster WGSF when I was younger.  Before my dad could think about it, it was released back in the drink."
352506,anders,2009-06-16 15:16:00,1168, Wow...three days apart...must of been on cloud nine
352508,silvio,2009-06-16 15:17:00,433,2 records in 3 days thats got to be a record to.
352513,BillM,2009-06-16 15:29:00,17367,I dunno if I believe that brookie record that was pulled out of Eugenia.
352532,CLofchik,2009-06-16 17:04:00,854," Lol anybody else remember Berkeley's $1k IGFA promotion?  If you set an IGFA record with Trilene, you'd get USD$1k.  Well that's all well & good, except that a few guys clued into the fact that alot of obscure fish didn't have ANY official records set, so you'd get guys going on an Alaskan trip for inconnu, and catch a 15lb'er on Monday, a 17lb'er on Tuesday, and a 19lb'er on Wednesday.....and all were records.  Woot there's their fishing trip paid for, thanks Trilene!  At one time I was the 4lb & 30lb line class record holders for carp, helped pay for my first motorcycle in high school"
352548,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-16 17:54:00,10439,Back in the 80's I caught what would have been the all tackle world record for carp at 55# had I not released it to fight another day.
