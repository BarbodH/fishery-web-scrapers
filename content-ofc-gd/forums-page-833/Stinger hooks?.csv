351587,splashhopper,2009-06-13 02:31:00,2931,"I have just noticed these on the wall at my local tackle shop and am wondering about trying them when bass season opens..  any suggestions,, pro  or con ?  thanks"
351588,johnnyb,2009-06-13 02:33:00,3413,I put 'em on all my jigs when ice fishing...and the odd time when bassfishing if I'm finding I'm getting lots of bumps but no hook-ups...worth having in the box IMO
351591,Dara,2009-06-13 02:37:00,3052,We use them for walleye when they are biting short
351618,crankbait,2009-06-13 03:40:00,82,"They are nice to have, but you can manage without them as well."
351653,splashhopper,2009-06-13 11:53:00,2931," How would I know they are ""biting short"" if they are missing the hook?"
351679,musky66,2009-06-13 15:16:00,273,"If you can feel pick-ups or 'bumps' but fail to get a hook set- probably fish bitting short or nibbling. Usually indicates a neutral or inactive mood. I always run them on my spinnerbaits for Musky. 95% of my fish come on the main hook- but nailed a sweet 42""ski last week on the stinger. That hook saved the day!"
351717,Rich,2009-06-13 20:46:00,3927,"Maybe it's a confidence thing for me, but I find when I add stingers to jigs I can't get a bite.  Stinger on a buzzbait is a must, occasionally on a spinnerbait in open water."
351720,Garry2Rs,2009-06-13 20:57:00,1425,I put stingers on all my spinnerbaits. I use surgical tubing on the hook eye so they stay in-line with the main hook.
351881,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-06-14 13:47:00,115,"Ditto Garry!! Won't throw one without it. Only diff is i put the stinger eye over the baits hook, than cut a 1/2 ""piece of tubing and just push it to the bend of the main hook. This way the stinger has flexibility and still stays inline. I have done it with the tubing over the eye and than pushed onto main but like the looser, free swinging trailer."
351896,Garry2Rs,2009-06-14 14:22:00,1425,"Johnny; in a pinch I have cut a section out of a wide rubber band, the type that comes off of broccoli, and done it your way, or sandwiched the hook eye.  All of these ways work, the trailer is not too snaggy plus you have doubled you hook count."
352075,Jonny,2009-06-15 05:24:00,1380,A stinger on a jig when fishing with worms is almost a must. It seems to me that I catch as many fish on just the stinger as on the main hook.
