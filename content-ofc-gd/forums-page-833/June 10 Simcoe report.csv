Great day out there and my sincere thanks for James for taking me out on his boat and to his good friend Evan for the great company and loughs. No one  was sure how many fish we've got today but the consensus was well over 50...with James solidly on the leader board. 3 triple headers and 10 doubles. Needless to say the weapon of choice was ,.....Meegs....naturally! A lot to learn from a Pro like him... It is James turn to write the upcoming Lake O. report soon ;-)) Few shots from my Blackberry:            Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
