Headed out to 150 and started with wire and braid dipseys and 2 riggers. Moderate marks at 60-80 down. Broke the Cannon temp probe setting the first rigger. By 9 we had 2 - 5lb chinooks off the fixed sliders - Dreamweavers SS - blue/pink. Picked up another 8 lb chinook on green yellow chucklet 80 down over 220. old school lure !!!  Watched the fish drop deeper as the day went on. Had 3 more small chinooks down 100 over 220 and then a nice 30"" fat chinook 140 deep over 250 to end the day. My son fought that bigger one for 15 minutes, several good runs and he asked me if I could help and reel in in for a bit, just till it got close and then he'd take over again.  Can't think of spending a better Saturday morning, The 8 lber   My son holding the fatty. built like a tank - nasty lamprey mark all up the one side.  producers today, Dreamweaver on the far right was tops   The OFC tag for team 8 must have blown out of the boat somewhere just off 16 mile creek"
