We've got them at work, but because of that foil packaging I've yet to see the bait up close - feel it, smell it, etc.  I know they're relatively new, but I'm just curious if anyone has some thoughts."
327066,rbaquial,2009-04-06 17:28:00,968,"I checked their website out - they look interesting enough to give them a shot - just not too sure about quantity in their packaging... ranging from as small as 2 to 8 per package! I hope they don't cost a lot! Where do you work? Any idea where else we may be able to find these?  I personally prefer Gulp!Alive - mainly cause they're biodegradable. I don't mind paying the price, for the amount I get in their packaging. Its certainly more than what TriggerX has to offer.  My 2 Cents..."
327189,bdox,2009-04-06 21:40:00,329, I saw a guy stocking them at a Canadian Tire in Hamilton a couple weeks ago.
327257,wuchikubo,2009-04-06 23:19:00,1114,"LB has them, I recall the package of 4 was near $8!!! I didn't pick up any as I have too much to go through already."
327354,ADB,2009-04-07 02:52:00,444, I work at Le Baron...the packs are $7.36.
327387,e-z-out,2009-04-07 03:56:00,1052,"This is what the line up looks this year for TriggerX baits      Now ask yourself are they worth the price?  Fotgot to add they have crabs, shrimps, and strip baits as well not shown in the pic."
327389,rbaquial,2009-04-07 04:06:00,968, MAYBE.....M*A*Y*B*E.... the attractant? just to see how well it performs compared to others on the market...
327390,e-z-out,2009-04-07 04:10:00,1052,Let me know how it works out. For now i'll stick to my GYCB
352074,rbaquial,2009-06-15 05:18:00,968,Just thought I'd bring up this topic again.... Anyone give these a try yet?  The amount sold 'per package' is really turning me off from buying them... I really like the fact its Biodegradable though (I didn't know they were before).  Still prefer Gulp!Alive.... more per package and it seems more reasonable in terms of price.
352082,Terry,2009-06-15 10:01:00,14456,I was with a guy using them they seem to work well caught fish  but stink...you smell it and it will remind you of a smell that every man fears....... everyone that smelled it said the same thing
352088,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-15 10:55:00,3761,"I bought some of there jerk shad things. White is the color, kind of neat that there individually packed in some scented juice. I'll give them a go eventually and report back to anybody interested."
352129,hirk,2009-06-15 13:18:00,571,"I have them in the store.Terry funny you say that,when I opened one 3 of us said that as well,reminded us of what to expect when you take her camping on an island for a week:)"
352130,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-15 13:28:00,0,.............Stuff is NASTY!......... Not sure if they're  worth the 7 bucks.............. Id think half the price was packaging.....
