I feel more like I'm pretending to fish than actually fishing, but I'm learning as I go. This weekend I'm planning to head for Dalrymple lake, thanks to the ""close eyes and randomly point at a map of Ontario"" method. I've tracked down the boat launch and a map that gives some idea of where I'll find what, but I'd greatly appreciate any pointers or good spots to try. I'm not fussy about what I'm catching (provided it's in season). I'll be fishing from a kayak - which I'd owned for less than 2 hours before I cut a hole in it to mount a rod holder. Think that voids the warranty?  Any advice appreciated!"
