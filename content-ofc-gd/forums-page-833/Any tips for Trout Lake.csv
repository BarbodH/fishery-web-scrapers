I live prectically beside it and have been out in my canoe a couple times, but without sonar have no real idea what the depths are etc, so just threw out a jig head with black double curly tail in a few spots.  Also a Gulp natural crawler on a jig head as well.  A few pointers for this lake would be great!  Any members from the area up here,please feel free to PM me."
