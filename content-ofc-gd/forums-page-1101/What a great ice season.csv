147755,carp-starter,2008-01-03 22:29:00,253,"I also say â€“ let the melting begin. But it is still close to 4 months for the opening of the trout season.  But I am waiting for the temp to go up and down a number of times. Under these conditions of temp variation, the Toronto GTA will have some nice holes. And this is where I will be. These holes will be perfect for an Ugly Stick even though I do not have one.  As soon as we get a warm spell, I will be out with a chair and hit one of these holes. Oh, sh-t, I have to look for some appropriate clothing. It sure will be nice to put on a pair of rubber slippers and try to hook a fish or 2.  When I get back, I will post a report. Good luck guys.  carp-starter   "
