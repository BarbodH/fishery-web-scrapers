147522,bassmaster4,2008-01-03 03:41:00,801,"Hey, I havent posted in a while but i was at C.T today and i saw a pretty nice ugly stick rod and reel combo but left it on the rack figured id ask first before i pay the 50 bucks. Has anyone had any problems with them and how are they?"
147526,drwxr,2008-01-03 03:52:00,453,"i have a 7 footer and 8-6, now planning to get another 9"" or longer, great rods. dont know what reel is there with it but should be something decent. "
147528,bassmaster4,2008-01-03 03:56:00,801,alright thanks a lot ill pick it up sometime this week
147531,holdfast,2008-01-03 04:00:00,1813,"The ugly stick is 34 dollars at Walmarts I believe so the reel is 16 dollars.  If the Reel is a Skakespere Sigma.  I would say Heluva deal. By the way I have a Sigma and itworks just as good as my High Priced Shimanos.  And the Ugly stiK, Best all around rod on the market for the price in my opinion.  My rod is going on 10 years old now and makes for a good trolling rod.  My Opinion though as I dont even pretend to be a professional"
147533,bassmaster4,2008-01-03 04:02:00,801,"yea im pretty sure its a sigma so ill definately buy it since its a ""heluva"" deal lol"
147538,drwxr,2008-01-03 04:44:00,453,ugly stick special at lebaron 29.94!!! that makes you more flexible towards the reel.
147572,pikehunter,2008-01-03 12:09:00,1659,"I have an Ugly Stick Light. It's OK, no problems.  LeBaron's price is good, it matches up well with a Mitchel 300X reel.  I can remember when the Ugly Stick first came out, back then it cost around 90 bucks! And that was in 1970's dollars."
147587,Rich,2008-01-03 13:12:00,3927,I love Ugly Stik rods. The reels have all fallen apart within one season on them though. Never tried the Sigma though.
147610,cranks bait,2008-01-03 14:07:00,721,"I think this is the same combo I bought last year.  It was an Ugly Stik lite 6'6"" Med. spinning cork handle with a Shakeshpere reel.  At the time I think I paid $80 for it.  As a first rod, since my Zebco special when I was 8 years old, I thought it was decent.  It is now the last rod I pick up.  It is heavy and lacks sensitivity compared to my other rods.  Which in all fairness I expect.  Nothing wrong with it other than that.  I prefer the combo that I got with my OFAH membership better though."
147642,Beans,2008-01-03 15:03:00,3339,"I used an Ugly Stik with a Mitchell 300 for many many years until it became fashionable to use several rods rather than change lures and spools...  I still have a couple of Ugly Stiks in my arsenal...one 6'6"" one piece coupled with a Shimano Curado baitcasting reel and the other is a two piece 7' that I was using for carp fishing until I inherited an 11' Aurora Barrinton carp rod with an Okuma  baitrunning reel this past summer...  Like a Timex watch...the Ugly Stix take a lickin' and keep on ticking..."
147649,mistyriver1,2008-01-03 15:47:00,600,Still have a couple as well.  Good rods for the money.
147671,bassmaster4,2008-01-03 17:11:00,801,im gonna be live bait fishing and jigging most of the time and some one said there not very sensitive should i consider another rod?
147711,Handlebarz,2008-01-03 20:20:00,3790,I love ugly sticks I have 4 of them for my musky troling rods 4 UL with 4-6lbs line and a few other mid size ones for the money you can not beat them. For years I was buying $100++ Shimano rods and breaking them but since I have switched back I have not had a problem. I do haowever just buy the rod and put my own reel on them
147713,drwxr,2008-01-03 20:29:00,453,"most of the ugly sticks are medium, so with braided line you will feel every bump. no worries..."
147714,misfish,2008-01-03 20:33:00,29133," Norm,your ready to go on the tour then.LOL  I have only used one ugly stick and that one was for down rigging (still have it). I love it.Great tip flex/sensitivity, and great back bone."
147809,bassmaster4,2008-01-04 01:59:00,801,thanks for the help everyone
