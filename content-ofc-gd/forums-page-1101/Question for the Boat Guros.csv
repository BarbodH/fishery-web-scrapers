147761,GNODDY,2008-01-03 22:43:00,163,I just bought a 14' princecraft with floors and livewells and such. My question is my boat is a SHort Shaft boat and I have a 15 hp for it now but I know this isn't going to be sufficient. Does anyone know where I can a transom extension kit or has anyone ever made the plates for the transom extension. There are kits out there but I can't seem to find one online and finding a 20 or a 25 HP in a Short Shaft is pretty difficult.  Any tips would be great.  Thanks  Geoff

147778,glen,2008-01-04 00:11:00,2641,You best get a short shaft and save yourself some headache.  If you have a 15hp then you would want to go to at least a 25hp cause going up 5hp aint going to do squat.

147782,aplumma,2008-01-04 00:20:00,6896,what you are looking for is called a jack plate but you will be messing up the thrust line by adapting a long shaft to a short shaft boat.  Art
147785,GNODDY,2008-01-04 00:29:00,163,"Its a 15"" transom and I think I will just look for short shaft"
147787,Sinker,2008-01-04 00:35:00,8692,"Shouldn't be too hard to find a short shaft engine.  You can get by with a longshaft and a jack plate, but its prolly cheaper and easier to wait and find a short shaft outboard.  Sinker"
147792,bigfish1965,2008-01-04 00:44:00,3382,"My merc is only 2 years old so they should still sell the short shaft. Just look for the model code to not have the 'L' in it. ELPTO means electric start, long shaft, power tilt/trim, oil injected.. EPTO means the same without long shaft."
147939,boatman,2008-01-04 15:13:00,350,There are lots of short shaft motors in that size. Probably more SS than LS in that hp range. You shouldn't have a problem getting something.
