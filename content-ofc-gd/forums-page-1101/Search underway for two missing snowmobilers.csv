York Regional Police said the two men from the Town of Georgina are experienced snowmobilers, who were dressed appropriately for the weather.  The police marine unit and helicopter are being used in the search. Police are hoping someone in the area has seen them.  Docherty has been described as six-feet four-inches tall, about 230 pounds, wearing a blue and white Yamaha jacket, with reflective decals on the arms.

147442,Fisherman,2008-01-02 23:37:00,7201,I just wonder what possesses people to do that.  Will we ever see a season where people will wait long enough and not cause grief to their families.  Why?
147444,ketchenany,2008-01-02 23:47:00,3229,"CTV news, one man is dead and they are in the recovery mode to find the other, apparently 1 km out from shore  Condolences the the family o fthe recovered man."
147446,Joey,2008-01-02 23:50:00,9122,"Yes, I just saw the news, very sad.  Anyone know exactly where it was, I know Virginia Beach area, but whereabouts on the lake.  I want to make sure I stay away from that area for sure as we were considering going out to VB this weekend.  Joey"
147447,wuchikubo,2008-01-02 23:52:00,1114,"Sounds like a sad ending for two families.  I only read 2 sleds and one helmet recovered, no bodies yet. Although the police mentioned they believe they have the ""bodies"" there."
147454,mcallister.grant,2008-01-03 00:15:00,327,That is absolutely terrible!!! My condolences to the families...
147461,medmart,2008-01-03 00:40:00,587,my condolences to the family's i was out there fishing Monday and there where cars and trucks out on the ice i wonder if they hit a spot where the ferry crosses  rob
147463,ketchenany,2008-01-03 00:48:00,3229,"Joey, I heard a short snip of the report as I was having dinner and heard it was just Northeast of Georgina Island. Lew posted last week and mentioned ""think of the rescuers""  also. No fish or and outing is worth putting your life in danger and leaving behind a family. I have come close (in the fog and snow) and believe me it's scary . .  Be very careful when heading out."
147464,Bernie,2008-01-03 00:54:00,3190,Very sad indeed. Sorry for the families involved. A friend stopped by my shop today and told me he went through with his ATV on Nipissing today. He is an experienced guy on the lake too. Goes to show you really need to be cautious. Areas on Nipissing that had snow drifts and high current flow areas still only have a couple inches of ice.
147530,kickingfrog,2008-01-03 03:59:00,8333,Barrie news said both bodies have now been found.  Terrible waste.
147644,LeXXington,2008-01-03 15:06:00,1928,"Very sad, Sympathy to the family,"
