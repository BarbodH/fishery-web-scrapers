147328,LeXXington,2008-01-02 15:54:00,1928, WTG Joey thats a super fish anytime of the year. Just amazing through the ice on 4lb test  JUST WOW!!!!
147360,Joey,2008-01-02 18:30:00,9122,"Okay, so I took the carp over to the post office and had it officially weighed, it came it at 28.26 lbs (12.82 kg).  I ended up calling the IGFA and the largest  carp caught on 4 lb test is 38.07 lbs.  She said I could have won if I was in a certain state, because they have state records, but they do not have Canadian province records  Oh well, it was still fun to catch and a real blast to start off the new year.  Thanks everyone for your congrats and kind words.  I really appreciate it.  Joey"
147361,oldphart,2008-01-02 18:39:00,665,"~~~So close,   oh well you set your own record, for your self, way to go young lady"

147387,Beans,2008-01-02 19:56:00,3339,Did you tell him you knew Photoz ???
147389,irishfield,2008-01-02 19:59:00,26272,That would have put a kibosh on it for sure Norm ! LOL

I was just a teensy bit disappointed when I saw what it was, because I just knew you had caught a monster Pike.  .. but that quickly passed.  If taxidermy wasn't so expensive, I'd say have that thing mounted with that itty bitty ice rod and reel above it. Landing a brute like that on such small equipment is something to really be proud of!"

147180,OhioFisherman,2008-01-01 23:15:00,6623,"LOL Nice job Joey, had to be a blast not knowing exactly what, but big. Just teasing on the snag, I have caught a lot that ate things they weren`t supposed to eat, minnows, tubes, jigs. I thought maybe it took the perch after you hooked it. Didn`t look like cold water was slowing down it`s eating, fat rascal!"
147181,TJQ,2008-01-01 23:19:00,7806,Thats the biggest goldfish I have ever seen!!!!!   congrats!!!

147199,Joey,2008-01-02 00:14:00,9122,"Terry, I love that second video, that's hilarious.  Interestingly enough, while we were packing up back at the truck, did you notice that guy come by and take a picture.  I thought he was taking a picture, but he did hold the camera up the whole time, then said to look on Youtube for it.  He said to search for the Terry Goy entry for today.  I have looked but nothing there so far.  Jeez, I hope he wasn't taping everything, I think I acted like a complete dork, saying a woman caught it  Oh well, we'll see I guess, Hahahahahaha.  Thanks for the congrats everyone, I'm still on cloud nine, over a carp  Joey"

147131,Terry,2008-01-01 19:44:00,14456,"4 lb test line,  monster, not the fish we thought   I took video for about 20 minutes and just as she got the fish to the hole the cameras card was full   <object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value="""
147132,darsky,2008-01-01 19:56:00,586,oh the suspense.So what was it and how big??
147134,Terry,2008-01-01 19:59:00,14456,I didn't think it was my place to say  so I will wait  for her to post about it I thought I would just  get people prepared  for the cooks bay monster
147135,Mike the Pike,2008-01-01 20:04:00,3421,Dam Terry your such a tease I can't wait .......................
147136,Canuck2fan,2008-01-01 20:12:00,1444,While your waiting for her post it might not hurt to go look in the camera manual on how to delete pics to free up some space on the camera.... LOL
147137,Terry,2008-01-01 20:21:00,14456,"it took so long to bring in the fish, I broke the record into a few files, but I had to delete  twice so I could get the fish coming up the hole, but the card filled up for a third time and as I was deleting some files she had the fish's head out of the hole so I was SOL, then we used her camera to take all the pictures so we wait till she post about it"
147138,Cookslav,2008-01-01 20:26:00,1457,mmmm...what could it be? 20 minute fight on 4 lb test through the Ice....must be a biggun!
147139,Joey,2008-01-01 20:39:00,9122,"Well, what a fantastic start to the New Year for fishing  As Terry said, she was a brute and our 25 lb scale bottomed out so we aren't really sure how much she ways.  Probably close to 30 lbs I'm sure.  We had a hard time getting her through the hole, but finally she must have exhaled some air and out she came, like Lady Simcoe giving birth  Here she is.          What a thrill.  Thanks for the video Terry and the company.  A pleasure as always.  Joey"
147140,FishFinder,2008-01-01 20:41:00,481,what did you do with it?
147141,Cookslav,2008-01-01 20:45:00,1457,Oh my!!!  That fit through the hole LOL!!!  Giving birth is about as Acurate as you could get in describing that scenario I'm sure
147142,lew,2008-01-01 20:49:00,12767,"WOW !!  Your PB musky in November to finish of 2007 and now that brute to start off 2008  Your definetely on fire, Kiddo !!"

147146,Shelley Cooper,2008-01-01 20:55:00,394,WTG Joey...  A real NICE start to the 2008 fishing year....  Happy New Year....
147147,Terry,2008-01-01 20:58:00,14456,"Joey, I think you really might have a line class record this is what I  found Carp, common 	 02 kg (4 lb) 	 11.79 kg (26 lb 0 oz) 	 Merrimack River 	 October 8, 2000 	 Jonathan R. Yates  yours is bigger"
147148,Joey,2008-01-01 21:03:00,9122,"Cool, so how do I get it officially weighed?  I stood on the scale at home and then on the scale with the fish (Paul did it also) and it was 28.4 lbs. both times.  And for those asking, it did not live long after being caught.  It was a long fight and coming through the hole was a bit much for it I think.  Paul's has a co-worker who loves carp so he will be eating it.  I should get it weighed first tho I think.  Joey"
147149,ccmtcanada,2008-01-01 21:07:00,7971,Wow Joey!!! That's one huge fish to bring through the ice!! Congrats on the PB!!
147151,Canuck2fan,2008-01-01 21:10:00,1444, I was joking of course and I sympathize. Hard to know how long landing a monster like that will take.
147152,Beats,2008-01-01 21:11:00,543,Must have gotten a lot of awkward stares from people seeing you leave the lake with a carp.  Take it to a Canada Post office and get it weighed there.  As far as I know it must be weighed on a government scale.
147153,Canuck2fan,2008-01-01 21:13:00,1444, I'm not sure how you get it weighed officially but keep in mind to get a line size record your line has to be tested too. It must break within a certain weight too.  Here is a set of rules by the ofah  http://www.ofah.org/GetPDF.cfm?ID=Fish/RecdFish.pdf
147154,addict,2008-01-01 21:20:00,475,that is one huge ugly perch lol.good job thanks for the pics.
147156,OhioFisherman,2008-01-01 21:20:00,6623,"LOL snagged it? It wouldn`t have possibly eaten the Perch on purpose, they don`t eat meat. LOL"
147157,Joey,2008-01-01 21:36:00,9122," Hahahaha, I wasn't using the perch for bait, LOL.  I was using a flashy lure with a minnow, and it was caught by the lips.  The perch was a comparison shot  Joey"
147159,steve_paul,2008-01-01 21:39:00,658,"Congrats, Joey.  Great start for you in 2008"
147161,PatrickGG,2008-01-01 21:58:00,562,"Awesome catch Joey, must have been on good fight for 4 pound test on a ice rod, Congrats thats a line record for sure."
