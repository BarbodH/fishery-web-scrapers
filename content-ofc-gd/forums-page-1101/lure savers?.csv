147249,forrest,2008-01-02 04:10:00,1032,I was browsing the Internet and saw something called lure saver.  I got to thinking about those 3 nice Rapala's I lost one day in the summer.  I would think that a few fish might be lost or line might snap before the clip gave way.  Has anyone ever used these?  forrest
147265,bigfish1965,2008-01-02 05:34:00,3382,They are nice but cost more than most of my lures. The company sent me a bunch awhile back..used them and they worked.

One end was straightened to given the lead someplace to bond to. They work ok, cheap to make                . Just slid it on the line and let it slide down and jiggle, usually knocks the lure loose."

I think I will keep a set of these price ""lure savers"" for days when I want to fish that extra bit closer to that submerged tree with one of my nice Rapala's or some other lure, I told the wife, only cost $2.  forrest"
147525,Zib,2008-01-03 03:51:00,369,I've been using Cabela's Snagmaster for over 12 years & I lost count of how many lures that it saved along with my buddies lures. There have been times when I couldn't free the lure & ended up pulling up the tree that the lure was snagged on. I highly recommend it.  Snagmaster
