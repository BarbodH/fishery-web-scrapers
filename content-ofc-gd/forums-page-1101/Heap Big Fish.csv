147591,danbo,2008-01-03 13:25:00,2646,I Think they should stock these in Lake Scugog..  
147592,ranger520vx,2008-01-03 13:28:00,164,"Agreed, even if just around the town launch to eat the guys launching and loading boats with their waders on."
147594,big guy,2008-01-03 13:33:00,414,Launching boats with their waders on? Who the hell does that? Have you actually seen this in real life?
147595,ranger520vx,2008-01-03 13:36:00,164,"Pick a weekend in summer, get there about 2pm ( you see both lauch & load  @ that time). Bring a camera."
147597,big guy,2008-01-03 13:39:00,414,"Good lord, now I've heard everything. I can almost except it for very late season when the water is cold, but in the summer!!!  Maybe I'll leave the camera at home and bring a bat instead... smarten some of these people up a little."
147601,danbo,2008-01-03 13:52:00,2646,Maybe we could slip a few million of these into the lower Credit River..  
147604,Hookset,2008-01-03 13:58:00,367,  Ya I agree. They could add some of those Tarpon as well.  Hookset.

147619,Greencoachdog,2008-01-03 14:19:00,8163,Looks like Fat Boy in the first pic has already eaten one or two of those Goliath Groupers.
147625,ranger520vx,2008-01-03 14:24:00,164,Goliath Grouper?????  Its a Lake Simcoe Smallmouth...the new Dale Hollow......
147626,danbo,2008-01-03 14:26:00,2646,Yee Haaawwww!!!  I knew I could cheer ya's up!
147627,Beans,2008-01-03 14:28:00,3339,"  Now wait just a darn minute guys...someday you will be in your seventies and will not be agile enough to be balancing on the tongue of your trailer to guide it on or kick it off...my first mate (wife) and I have got the launching of the ""Tin of Beans"" down pretty well for only twice a year...    "
147630,danbo,2008-01-03 14:34:00,2646,Atta boy!
147716,misfish,2008-01-03 20:38:00,29133,"  If Im not mistaken, thats a dragon fish. The local PHO shop here has one. It has grown very fast since he open. It is to bring them luck for thier bussiness,and it must be true, as he and his families bussiness has done very well here. I must admit,I got something to do with it. I love my PHO.LOL"
147878,sharper,2008-01-04 03:57:00,279,  Very popular fish for asian restuarants as they bring good luck. You can't go wrong with pho either
147879,Riparian,2008-01-04 04:02:00,269," That doesnt look real. How can a pig grow that size?  Maybe im mistaken, but dosent that look a little fishy to anybody?"
147882,Dondorfish,2008-01-04 04:10:00,1000,   Looks like what I know as an Aripama - from South America I believe.   Don
147894,steverowbotham,2008-01-04 05:38:00,1800," That actually is the world record boar shot in the Southern States last year by the boy, with that handgun.  There was a lot of controversy surrounding it, because it was an escaped domestic pig named Fred, but as far as I recall, the record stil lstands."
147895,steverowbotham,2008-01-04 05:39:00,1800,http://fieldandstream.blogs.com/news/2007/...og_central.html  for the boar!
147896,Riparian,2008-01-04 06:15:00,269,lol.  Thats all I can do.  
147919,Greencoachdog,2008-01-04 12:28:00,8163,"  That is a huge pig, but camera angle has a lot to do with it looking larger than it really is. If the boy was standing upright in front of the pig instead of leaning against it from behind... it wouldn't look quite as big.  That pig was shot about 20 mi. from where I live.   btw... if you think that pig is big, you oughtta see some of our corn-fed Rednecks!!!"
