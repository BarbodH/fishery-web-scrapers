147613,Mike Pike,2008-01-03 14:11:00,1332,Carefull!  That's a reeeeeally old link!!!  I just checked the Lake Simcoe operators and there are a couple right off the bat that I know haven't been in business for years.
147620,danbo,2008-01-03 14:20:00,2646,Maybe you could fix it bro..
147631,Mike Pike,2008-01-03 14:35:00,1332,I dunno if it's fixable.  I think it's just an old site that hasn't been updated in a few years.  I'm thinking there has to be a more current or complete list of operators somewhere?
