Now some of you have already noticed that we (as in Rick) have created a new ""News"" section in the ""General Discussion Subforums"". This is a read only forum that all Mods can post in. I hope with all Mods participating we can keep this current so that OFC members can peruse fishing and outdoor related news in one convenient location. If you have anything of interest you'd like to see posted feel free to PM me or one of the other Mods.  Thanks Spiel"

His generous sharing of fishing information in the Bruce County and Saugeen watershed was quite useful.  I had met Grant briefly several years ago while fishing the 'geen.  A truly great sportsman will be greatly missed.  John"
