After not being able to locate any,,,mind you alot of sales out there for huts that don't exist,,,i took it upon myself to contact the clam corperation myself through an e-mail asking why there was such a shortage,,,this was my response  Sonny,  The guide is a very popular model, in fact we are completely sold out of them for the season.  You might be able to find one through Bass Pro or Cabelas, otherwise your best bet is to try calling all the dealers in your area.  Here is a link to our dealer locator:  http://www.clamcorp.com/company/dealers.html  Thanks,  Darik   Darik Steinbach   Customer Service  Clam Corporation  763-231-4131  [emailÂ protected]  Visit www.clamcorp.com to order items online   SOOOO  instead i will be the proud new owner of a shappell rover 2.0dx.....alls well that ends  well,,,more room then a guide and a bench seat to sqeeze in the little guy(don't really need to squeeze..) http://shappell.com/images/RV2D_400.jpg Just thought ya might like to know if you were looking for one!"
147481,buckster,2008-01-03 01:56:00,530,That bench seat is a great option!
147500,Mike the Pike,2008-01-03 02:29:00,3421,Sonny I will keep my eyes open for one here in Quebec.If I see one I will notify you.  I am planning a trip to Quinte in February so if I locate one I could always meet you there with it or have Percher bring it back   I have seen quite a few of the single flip over clams at Sail Baron .  Since I am on the road I visit alot of outdoor stores in different locations.With luck maybe we will find one who knows maybe they will ship your way.  Mike

147505,Mike the Pike,2008-01-03 02:39:00,3421,IS it a flip over model?Don't forget frabill has similar flip over models.
147527,Zib,2008-01-03 03:54:00,369,I was looking at the Clam Guide myself just a few days ago at Gander Mountain here in Michigan. The stores here in Michigan have a good supply of all the Clam ice shelters.
147650,bow slayer,2008-01-03 15:47:00,1074,I actually have a brand new guide still in the box in my garage. I have been debating whether or not to keep it with 3 kids playing rep hockey my time for fishing has disappeared. I would like to keep it but have not  decided what to do.
