147820,darsky,2008-01-04 02:15:00,586,I just saw the story of the Toronto teen killed by another. Really really upsetting.
147824,douG,2008-01-04 02:20:00,2693,And so it should be.
147844,fishing n autograph,2008-01-04 02:52:00,2540,It's sad because there are many parents out there today that don't see that their children's actions are wrong. I'm finally seeing the total breakdown of the family....It's starting and I feel it's going to get worse before it gets better.
147846,Greencoachdog,2008-01-04 02:55:00,8163,... but it aint nothin' new... and that's the saddest part.
147854,steverowbotham,2008-01-04 03:14:00,1800,Any story in particular ?? there were like 80 teen homicides in toronto in  07
147867,irishfield,2008-01-04 03:29:00,26272,I presume he's talking about the 15 year old girl stabbed to death on New Years eve... ?
147870,douG,2008-01-04 03:38:00,2693,"Still a sad day to say GoodBye to a 14 year old daughter, niece, sister, or friend.  How could two cops possibly raise a normal family? What FishnAuto is seeing is the abdication of parental responsibility and attention, not the ""total breakdown of the family"".  Sounds like an impossible situation for these poor folks.  On the other hand, some families do jes' fine.  That number of 84 murders in the GTA is the total for the whole population of 4.5 million, NOT 84 TEEN HOMICIDES, like some suggested.  Where do folks come up with this crap?  BAD MISERABLE  PERSON.  Twist yer hankie somewheres else.  Sadly, a few will follow that lead on this garbage.  Hate to say this, but if you don't back up your statements with a credible reference, stifle.  Stop it already.  Toronto had 84 homicides in 2007, five fewer than the record 89 murders set in 1991.  Based on data from some cities in North America, 2100 killings would have occurred in Toronto, we get 84.  Hardly the optimum number, but going in the right direction."
