147073,elee886,2008-01-01 16:23:00,9,"Thanks for the welcome from Stan.  I forgot to introduce myself before posting, so here goes it.  I'm originally from Cobourg and currently live in Toronto. I started fishing as a kid in the seventies, so if I say ""pickerel"", I probably meant to say ""walleye"".  Seriously, lots of my best times with my dad have been out on the water. I expect to go steelheading with him on the weekend, weather permitting, so I'll try to post a report soon. I don't often take fishing photos, but I'll try my best.  Don't know if anyone's posted their New Year's resolutions yet, but mine are to get out ice fishing more often and to learn a little bit more fly tying from my dad.  Thanks for the great forum and Happy New Year!  Eric   "
