146928,icewalker28,2007-12-31 23:52:00,39,"I got out today with my dad up to Jack's. We were out on the ice by 8am and stayed till about 2. The crappie were biting well with the average size of 12-13"". Last week they were in 29fow right on bottom. Today we searched out the 38fow range and caught most fish at 4-6feet off bottom. The morning bite was very agressive and the noon till 2 was slow. Marked lots of fish and had a hard time getting biters after noon , but managed to fool a few. Marmooska jigs and minnow heads were the secret . Seems like the crappie are entering their deep water , suspending habit now. My dad and i with a photo op.    Brought 5 home for a New Years crappie feast!!  Happy New Year to everyone and play safe!!! Cheers!!!!"

147400,icewalker28,2008-01-02 21:04:00,39,"WTG oldphart. I had a hard time with the eyes. I was sure i marked a couple cruising bottom , but they wouldn't respond. We should get together for an outing up there this winter. Crappies are moving deep and should be a bit easier to catch soon hopefully. cheers, IW"
