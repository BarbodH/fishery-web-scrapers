I'd like to get it fixed this weekend if I can.  Thanks for your help...      Maureen"

147827,irishfield,2008-01-04 02:23:00,26272,Like Glen says.. but watch... on some doors each hinge can have a different distance from roller shaft to door face length... so as he suggests take the bad one with you to match up. They are done this way so the door seats against the seals at the last moment instead of dragging down the full length of the frame.

I will call Home Depot and ask if they carry the hinges and if not Wayne I will call the folks in Wyevale.  Thanks again  Maureen"
