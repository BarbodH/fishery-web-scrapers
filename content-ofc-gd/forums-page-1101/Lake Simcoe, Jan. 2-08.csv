FISH ON! so, we drilled another hole, set up the hut and a fishin we did go! well, from 8:30-12:45 we couldn;t put our rods down. bite slowed at 12:45 just a few fish here and there till about 1:30. so we packed it up then and headed home. we went out quite a ways on the ice, fished 40-45 FOW. jigging rapalas worked great, small jigging spoon, even a bare hook tipped with a minnow, waxie or maggot got fish. they hit anythin we dropped for them. days end, we landed over 250 perch, no real dinks, either. most fish were 8-10 inches... couple 11's and i landed my best best perch ever at 12 inches. jeff was handed a surprise when he pulled up his first whitefish ever. and that was funny cause neither of us were totally sure as to what it was, but i was pretty sure it was a white fish by the look of it... then, as we threw it to the hole... we realized the season was open for them so as we went to grab it... off it went, lol.  it was a great day though, super cold and windy, but still lots of fun. can't wait till next time!        Jeff's Whitefish   Jeffs Bucket, 27 Keepers   My Bucket, 23 Keepers   And My sink, before cleaning   Should have got more pictures... but we kept catching fish and didn;t have time, lol... and... it was just too damn cold!!  thanks for reading guys!"
