The crew was rounded up and met at the bait dispensary prior to theyre opening at 6am. With the necessities (minnows, powerade and pizza combos) secured it was a 1 1/2 hr drive followed by a 2km snowshoe to the spot of choice. -25C is cold!! Punched some holes and dropped down a buckshot rattler and this fella hit in about 10sec. Its gonna be a good day. Not so. Things were slow today with 5 guys fishing I got 3 lakers and others lost 2 fish. All the fish came off main lake points in 25-40fow. Not the usual productive start to the season but I avoided the dreaded white stripe. Great day out though put around 8km on the new snowshoes and got into the lake before anyone else this year.  Hope everyone else had a good start to trout. "
