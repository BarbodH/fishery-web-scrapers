147015,elee886,2008-01-01 07:42:00,9,"Don't forget sunglasses, sunscreen, and bolt cutters in case someone gets stuck with a hook.  Also a scoop to clear your hole and a dip net if you're using minnows.  Something to keep the kids occupied while they're not fishing will help to keep everyone happy.  Hope you and your kids have fun!  Eric"
147029,Big Cliff,2008-01-01 12:27:00,6899,"Many years ago (like about 40 or so) when I lived up in French River we didn't have the emergency kits and things availavle that you can get today. I made my own kit for hunting, it was quite simple; wewould take a soup can, one of the large (6-7"" tall, 3""dia) we would cut about 2/3 of the way arount the top of the can, fold the lid open and use the soup, then we would make our kit. Water proof matches, candle, strong fishing line, some hooks, a pocket knife, some oxo cubes and jerky, and many of the basic things that have already been mentioned. When our can was full we would then fold the lid back down as best we could and seal it with wax. You had to check the wax before each trip but that was easy enough.  If you did get stuck in the bush, the can served as a pot to boil the water, the fishing line could be used for all sorts of things, the oxo cubes made a nice warm broth to help you warm up if you did get cold. Well, I could go on but you'd be surprised at how much stuff you can put into one of those cans if you pack it carefully. I had a few very comfortable nights in the bush that might not have been enjoyable if I hadn't had that can with me.  Good topic by the way! some wonderful ideas."
147037,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 13:08:00,1114," Thanks Cliff, that was a good suggestion, the only foreseeable problem is that my kids may poke holes in it when I'm not looking. LOL"
147038,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 13:15:00,1114,"  Welcome to OFC Eric.  It's a great crowd, you should provide an introduction of yourself too.  Thanks for the reminders on the on sun protection. I'd have to check to see if the bolle goggles have decent UV protection, I'd figured that the balaclava hid the skin enough and the long nose plyers in the fishing box would act as the cutters for the hooks. I definitely forgot to put the ice scoop down, thx. I try to use spoons and jigs without live minnows as much as possible.  I guess if the kids aren't having fun, I'd pack it in and leave, whiney kids don't make fishing fun  Stan"
147039,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 13:16:00,1114," Point taken, I'd hope my fishing skills would address the emergency food issue though."

147165,mukluk,2008-01-01 22:14:00,196,"Congratulations Stan on your thread ;  "" emergency ice fishing kits.""   It had well over 400 hits and gave us all a ""heads up"" as to what we should carry with us on the ice in case something should go wrong. Maybe even saved someones life."
147183,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 23:22:00,1114," Thanx mukluk, however, I think it is something that everyone should consider at one point. Although we may fish solo from time to time, we are never fishing alone in our fishing community.  As I mentioned before, I'd rather be over prepared than underprepared if an emergency ever does arise. That said, I don't think I'd ever be 100% prepared.  Stan"
147247,danbo,2008-01-02 03:53:00,2646,"It's great to have a sled full of comfort & goodies with you. It's a pain to have to drag it around though. The Inuit would laugh to see all the electronics,etc. A pocketful of jigs,spoons,etc. A compass around your neck. A warm touque,sunglasses & ice picks on a string. Matches in a baggie. A knapsack with munchies/drinks/small flashlight/emergency blanket,tp,camera.a plastic bag for your catch of fish. A folding stool to sit on that has a sling to ease carrying it. Use common sense to notice the weather changes & surroundings. Beware ice over running water. Be safe..have fun."
147256,camillj,2008-01-02 04:51:00,1988,Great thread ... truth is even after over 40 years of doing this the list just keeps growing ... my trunk looks like a army surplus store ... but dont forget the more you drag out the less likely you are to explore  Anyhow .. just to add a couple of things ... as a matter of fact I picked some of these up myself at CT this last trip out ...   Flares (2 pack) Windproof lighter Reflective safety tape ... in case you are stuck in the 'fast lane' when the sleds are whizzing by after dark Zip-lock freezer bags (a few) .. they come in real handy to keep your phone and GPS dry in the snow/rain Axe/hatchet/saw ... I always have one in the trunk ... and have used them MANY times Spikes and lengths of Rope ... I use these to brace the portable or to anchor stuff in high winds on the ice ...the hatchet also doubles as a hammer

147453,wuchikubo,2008-01-03 00:06:00,1114,"  Thanx Danbo, however, I think if I had all that in the pack, my kids would be on such a sugar high I wouldn't know how to keep them fishing.    I have a float suit, but can't find one small enough for the kids, so life jackets will have to do with the rest of there clothing.  Camillj, I had thought about flares too, but considered them a bit too dangerous with kids around. (might have to rethink about this one)"
147520,holdfast,2008-01-03 03:32:00,1813,"406_01_survival_eqpt.docAttached is something I dug out from the Course I used to teach for Advanced Winter warfare.  Part of the course was survival.  We would pair 2 soldiers togeather and Leave them in the Bush for 4 Days 3 nights.  They would have only on them is their cloths on their back. One meal pack, a machete, their own survival pack that they were to make on their own. ( For homework each soldier was to make their own kit and turn it in unknowingly they to use it for their excercise). And lastly their sleeping bag with valise.  We would Excercise for a week as a group and the last day we would fool the students that they were going back to the base for the weeknd off.  Us instruictors would fool them so bad that we had them pack theyre kit on trucks.  We would then assemble them and tell them that a plane had just crashed and they had survived.  The looks on their faces was priceless.  Out came thir survival packs, one meal, and their valise that they packed to go back to base.  If they didnt pack right.  Too bad too sad.  We would then drop them off ever three Kms Blindfolded.  Dropped them off and told them that thir movement was one Km Radius.  Heres what I observed  1.The best shelter was a snow cave or lean to( A water proof groundsheet was invaluable to water proof shelter or used as a door).  Any other Shelter just took to much energy and resources to make) 2. Out of 20 students say 2 snares per, only 2 Rabbits caught and one Porcupine for a lucky pair ( not good odds).  Some ate their meal that night, others rationed to the last day. 3. The pairs that listened to what was taught, One collects firewood, the other sets snares , looks for water and food fared the best as long as their shelter was built before dark 4.  Smokers were bummed out the most, especially if they had none after running out. 5  At Night, each person had a log or two beside them and just slid them on the fire during the night.  A wood reflector made for the best heat 6. A durable Belt knife could chop small wood. cut foliage, tied as a spear, dig the ground, split wood, Much better to have than a pocket knife. A machete made the Medics job easier, because if they had an axe, I sure somebody would be injured.  A wire saw worked great could be stored in a small container.  safety pins were used as cloths hangers, trap triggers etc 7. Those that had their survival attitude, enthusiastic, moved around and kept busy.  Did well, while others were close to quiting I'm sure. 8.  A change of clothing( some took the hint to hide a change of cloths with their sleeping bag) and Hygiene not only brought on Morale, but also provided warmth) 9.  Safety- We had one person fall through the ice, A burnt sleeping Bag(too close to fire) as well as a few minor burns and a knife cut) 10. Lastly, a compass, map, can help you avoid a situation, if not lead you to land to survive "
147563,Big Cliff,2008-01-03 11:26:00,6899,"An old indian friend told me many years ago; ""it's better to build a small fire and sit close than to build a big fire and sit far away"".  I'd forgotten about the cable saw in the survival kit, thanks for the reminder. Since I moved down here I haven't really worried about a ""Kit"" because I don't travel to far from civilation any more, a compus and a few band aids but today is going to be too cold to do much outside so I think I am going to build a box to fit on my ATV and I'll make a storage compartment in it for a survival kit. Thanks for all the super ideas!"
147574,Hookset,2008-01-03 12:18:00,367,"Great post....gonna have to add afew things to my kit I see.  About the only thing I can add is do not place your ice picks in your pocket. If you fall thru the ice the last thing you will be able to do is open up a pocket and calmly extract your ice picks. These are designed (at least the type I have) to hang around your neck for instant access. Having the picks stored anywhere else is probably useless. If you do not have the style that goes around your neck, I suggest getting a set. Have a great trip when you do go.   Hookset."

146812,wuchikubo,2007-12-31 18:21:00,1114,"Hi All,  Being a dad with two young kids (7 and 4) who want me to take them ice fishing, I'm probably being overly cautious but that's me. I was just wondering what people had in their emergency kits (if you have one).  This is what I have so far: (in addition to the regular fishing gear)  Candle (idea from holdfast) Cell phone (I had it, just forgot to add it in, thanx Glen) Cleats for boots Compass (thanks to the many members reminding me of keeping it simple) Crazy glue (idea from Irishfield) Emergency blanket Emergency first aid kit (small) Emergency Ice picks (in float suit) Emergency matches (in waterproof container) Emergency throw line (in the works, 50 yards of nylon rope? Possibly something already premade.) Extra clothes in Ziplock bag Extra mitts/gloves in Ziplock (2 pairs for each person) Flashlight (shake light) FRS radio (would prefer Handheld VHF, but will have to make due with what I have) What frequencies are most common? Hand warmers Handheld GPS (still trying to acquire) -- back up with the compass Hot chocolate mix Powerbar or energy bars. Small shatterproof mirror Swiss army knife  If there something blatantly missing, please let me know.  For fishing gear:  Auger Balaclava Bomber hat Bottle of hot water Bottled water Bucket for fish Camping pot Extra batteries (for electronics) Extra fishing line Fishing License Fishing rods and reels Folding chairs Folding shovel Goggles Hooks and sinkers Ice scoop (thanx for the reminder Eric) Jigging spoons and lures Main gloves (1 pair) Portable heater Portable hut (thanx to Jim aka Mistyriver) Portable stove Propane tank Sonar/Flasher   Thanks,  Stan"

146820,ecxstriper,2007-12-31 18:35:00,343,you also forgot the Brandy  and maybe a flashight with a strobe light on it
146823,mukluk,2007-12-31 18:45:00,196,Hearingfish if you are venturing out on a big lake like Simcoe say more than half mile from shore than I would add a compass. An ice spud added to the list to check ice thickness as you walk out.
146825,Terry,2007-12-31 18:55:00,14456,"a toe tag for easy identification should they find you in the spring  LOL,  thats  a really good list"
146826,wuchikubo,2007-12-31 18:55:00,1114," Thanx Mukluk,  I'd be more inclined to stay within the area where most people would be fishing (assuming it's safe and tested). I'd probably would pack a spud if it was by myself and exploring new ice.  Stan"

I've been on simcoe, less than a mile out, and you can't see shore in any direction.....it gets spooky quick if you don't know which way is home, and there is open water on the lake still!!  Sinker"
146876,wuchikubo,2007-12-31 21:13:00,1114," Wayne, I've got the whistle on a lanyard attached with a LED light around the neck. Hmm, maybe I'll attach it to the float suit with a safety pin just to be sure.  Thanx"
146878,irishfield,2007-12-31 21:15:00,26272,Sounds good Stan... I left both my compasses up at the Lake.. so I guess I need to buy another one. Will get to your PM tonight.. gotta get back to the shop.
146882,wuchikubo,2007-12-31 21:18:00,1114," Wayne, that makes me think about getting a decent compass, as GPS will eventually run out of batteries. I'm gonna have to have the 7 year old help out with the sled as well. hehe  Thanks again."

146912,lunkerbasshunter,2007-12-31 22:55:00,2585,i talked to a fireman at wades landing marina in south bay of lake nip last summer and he told me his snow machine broke down at 430pm in the middle of winter about 3 miles out.  he was lucky enough to be about 1000 yards from a shore line so he camped out and light a fire with his water proof emergency matches. he swears he would have been dead without them.  Just goes to show you you can never be to safe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Good on you for thinking of everything!  Cheers!
146920,Corey,2007-12-31 23:19:00,355,"Get a 50' yellow nylon rope. You can keep it in the bag so it doesn't end up everywhere. You never know if you will need it to pull someone out, or have someone pull you out.  cd.  ps. don't forget your boots"
146923,pikehunter,2007-12-31 23:33:00,1659,Wow! How many ski doo's do you need to get all that gear out out there?  Never been ice fishing myself. Sounds like I need to do more than just slip on a pair of boots and long johns if I decide to give it a try eh?  Better safe than sorry I suppose.
146927,Beans,2007-12-31 23:50:00,3339,I always try to remember to keep a few band-aids in my pocket for when someone gets a little too close to the auger blades...and a pocket packet of kleenex or two...  A roll of toilet paper can come in handy at times...

146973,holdfast,2008-01-01 02:21:00,1813,"I dont care who you are or what you are.  A compass is paramount.  Whiteout, darkout, Brainfart out.  Leave it with your fishing gear.  Also never solely rely on a GPS. its electronic.  All GPS instructions will tell you that.  Dont know if its been mentioned, but a good candle can save the Day,  Use one match, Light the candle, then light your stove and fire with the candle.  Saves on wasted matches.  A candle is a bit of warmth, Morale, and light in an emergency shelter.  If its made of animal fat, you can eat it.  By the way I like this post.  Makes you think, and see other peoples prioritys"
146992,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 03:53:00,1114," Thanks Holdfast, the candle has a point in addition to the shake light and matches.  Thanks to Wayne again for reminding me on the Krazy glue.
