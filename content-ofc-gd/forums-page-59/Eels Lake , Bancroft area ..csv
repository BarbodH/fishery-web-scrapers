1033108,jjcanoe,2018-08-26 21:21:00,744,"We have a trailer at the north end of the lake, there are a few lake trout in there some up to 8lbs but are hard to catch this time of year. Plenty of small to medium sized bass both large and smallmouth.  Got a few 4lbers over the years but the average is 1.5 at the most. Only ever heard of one walleye being caught there but they are also supposed to be in there. The lake levels drop frequently this time of year since it is a feeder lake for the trend seven canal. Water is currently down about 7 feet from the start of the season and has dropped about 18"" since I was there last week. Lots of shoals to fish bass but this time of year they turn into islands "
