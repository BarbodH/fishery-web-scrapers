1032503,aplumma,2018-08-11 16:54:00,6896,rubber cement with a patch piece on top is what we used on our wetsuits. Coat both pieces allow to dry then put together with a rolling pin for pressure. Art

1032509,Snidley,2018-08-11 19:19:00,620,tHE BEST PRODUCT FOR WADER REPAIR IS aQUA sEAL. iT'S CONTACT CEMENT DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR NEOPRENE AS WELL AS gORETEX (BREATHABLE) MATERIAL. iF THE HOLES ARE SMALL JUST GOOP IT ON IF THERE'S A RIP OR TEAR TAPE SOME MATERIAL OVER THE HOLE. uSUUALLY WADERS COME WITH SOME PATCH MATERIAL TO DO JUST THIS TYPE OF REPAIR
1032522,grimsbylander,2018-08-12 03:14:00,3016,I had a great pair of neoprene stocking foot waders that I'd had for about 20 years before a mouse ate a 1 inch hole through them. I just threw them out....they would never have fit me anymore but now I get to blame the mouse!!

1032533,misfish,2018-08-12 14:08:00,29133,Well I bought the goop. $13 for a tube I will never use in a life time. Why cant they made a small tube? LOL  Thanks fellas for the help.  B
