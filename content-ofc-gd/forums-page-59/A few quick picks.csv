This time it was mostly eyes. We had a couple of walleye chop days that put over 50 in the boat (one of which saw us running 8 miles home in 3 -4 footers), a couple days when the weather locked em up for good periods of the day. We covered LOTS of water and were happy to have the Nautical Chart mounted on the wall,- it was a life ( and motor ) saver. There are no chips for this lake. lots of double headers. I ran nothing but my own home made baits one day - out fished my partner     these guys had me putting together extra worm harnesses on home made bait day as they bit me off frequently     as always, the fish here were thick across the middle and thick shouldered  once again, Kev got the biggest eye of the week,     this guy started home made presentation day by slamming a brass colorado blade spinner   one for supper, 2 for the freezer  the gator's punched 2 huge holes in the net I had to retie with 50lb flouro.  Thats makes 3 holes now - time for new netting       Gotta work on reviewing all the pictures for the year end summary - but you get the idea.

1032608,misfish,2018-08-14 10:10:00,29133,Welcome back safe and sound. Those are some nice fish bud.
1032622,spincast,2018-08-14 21:37:00,3279,"Thanks B - its a long ride, but the fishing, the scenery, and the away from it all makes it worth the trip. Interestingly enough, no signs of fires on the highway the whole 2700k round trip"
1032640,BillM,2018-08-14 23:49:00,17367,"Awesome man!  I never net the big ones, always just grab them.  Seem to not go crazy that way."
1032647,spincast,2018-08-15 00:57:00,3279,"Thanks Bill. Hand bombing them is something I haven't mastered yet. They were also more nuts than usual, combined with lighter set ups - I had to cut the first 20 foot of line off more than once because they were so energetic - they would make 20 foot runs, charge under  the boat, under the trolling motor, around the side, race past the stern and back to the front.. A lot of them were incidentals, Caught at least 15 on just a jig and a worm,  with 10lb flouro leaders, or home made worm harnesses on the same."
1032772,Pikeslayer,2018-08-18 00:43:00,1443,Looks like another successful Nippising trip in the books. Have you managed to fish the whole lake yet??
1032778,spincast,2018-08-18 10:02:00,3279,Thanks Sy - Wrong Nip though - not the one that sounds what you're not allowed to do in the pool   And we think there are still a few miles we haven't touched....lol - anything outside the red zone is still inviting us to return for that trophy 
1033054,Freshtrax,2018-08-25 14:05:00,2215,Looks like a great trip as usual.  I can't wait to get back.  Worth every min. Spent in the truck getting there.
