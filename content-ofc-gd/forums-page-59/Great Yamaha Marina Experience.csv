Also had them look it over and water test. Computer tested. No codes. 920 hours. Prearranged to drop off and wait to take back.   All done in 2 hrs. Parts and labour $373 + tax. Very happy with this motor and Walsten Marine. I would highly recommend them Cheers. Peter"

1032101,chris.brock,2018-08-02 02:57:00,4053,"yep, Walsten has a decent reputation up there, Harper not so much"
1032487,David Chong,2018-08-10 22:29:00,836,"As a long time Yamaha fan and operator, I have heard nothing but good things about the folks at Walsten Marine!"
1032555,Rizzo,2018-08-13 02:30:00,4754,That great. Maybe I need to vacation in Bobcaygeon if I ever need work on the engine
1032557,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-13 04:07:00,8243,"Good to hear. I was amazed  to learn what little the Marinas pay their mechanics though. I think that's why many Marine dealers have bad reputations. I was told they get 25 bucks an hour, maybe, and the Marine dealers are charging 100 an hour and above. $373.00 plus HST for 2 hours, not cheap but what is these days? Put Marine before a part and the cost gets ridiculous."
1032581,captpierre,2018-08-13 17:10:00,2521,I got a quote of $900 + tax for same minus computer scan near Lakefield ?
1032591,boombap,2018-08-13 21:31:00,310,"$25 an hour is a pretty decent gig to work on boats. AC in the summer, warm in the winter. All personal opinion of course."
