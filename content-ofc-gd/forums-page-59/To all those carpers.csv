1033052,wantabigone,2018-08-25 13:28:00,97,is this time of year a productive time? i went out recently to a spot I have had success and neither myself or others were catching. I normally have fished May/June though.
1033147,Mike Pike,2018-08-27 19:16:00,1332,"Definitely a productive time of year, wantabigone, but not at the spots you fished earlier in the season.  Those springs spots( like river and creek mouths as examples )may have worked in May and June are usually void of fish by now.  I find that deeper waters that have finally warmed up to the carps liking at this time of year can hold fish, and hungry ones! Good hunting!"
1033149,wantabigone,2018-08-27 21:14:00,97,Thanks Mike. That definitely rules out a new spot I was going to try this weekend. On to plan B.
