1032613,Sharkbait22,2018-08-14 19:25:00,297,I have bought two spools of Bloodrun in the past.  The first spool was great but the second spool not so. The line digs in to the reel every time I catch a fish.  So afterwards I need to pull a bunch of line off and then reel it back in.  #10 test.   Is this typical? Any other brands a might try?  Prefer low vis line. Thanks in advance for your input.
1032616,misfish,2018-08-14 20:15:00,29133,"Never an issue with Raven ( for me anyways ). Been using it for years now. I think if you horse the fish, what you have happening is the cause. Another thing could be doing super long drifts.  Just a thought. I run 12lb main"
1032632,mitch seguin,2018-08-14 23:11:00,98,Sufix ProMix 10 lb is my choice after trying out several mono lines.
1032637,BillM,2018-08-14 23:34:00,17367,"Really depends on how much pressure you're putting on that fish.   You'll get dig in with any line.   Anytime I land one, next cast is a bomber to avoid exactly this.    Even worse with braid. I run 6-8lb Nano or 8lb Fireline Crystal on my setups.   Casts a mile, mends good and hero drifts all day long, lol."
1032639,misfish,2018-08-14 23:48:00,29133,I was staying away from saying the hero drift thing Bill. Long drift.LOL
1032641,Snidley,2018-08-15 00:08:00,620,"I thought you asked about floating line. I use P-line Hydro Float 15lb or maybe 20lb, floating braid in high viz yellow. The  ONLY mainline option in my book ."
1032643,Sharkbait22,2018-08-15 00:39:00,297,Not much pressure on fish. Somtimes the fish are small residents. Yes floating line.  Very nice to use. Easy to mend/manage and quick to strike. I might try P-line Hydro. My eyes could use the help anyway but I'm not a fan of adding another section of clear mono for the split shot. The fact that no one else seems to have this issue might mean I got a bad spool of line or it was damaged (deet).
1032645,OhioFisherman,2018-08-15 00:51:00,6623,https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/gink-dry-fly-floatant That stuff will keep mono on top of the water.
1032648,Sharkbait22,2018-08-15 00:58:00,297,Gink is like vasoline. Likely would work though.
1032649,OhioFisherman,2018-08-15 01:06:00,6623,"I'm old, when I bought mine it came in a small metal tin and looked like wax."
1032651,Sharkbait22,2018-08-15 01:17:00,297,Gink is pretty legendary. Still works ... and stains everything. http://www.ginkandgasoline.com/
1032654,dave524,2018-08-15 01:59:00,4508,If your really old you put Mucilin on your silk fly lines and gut leaders ?
1032656,OhioFisherman,2018-08-15 02:29:00,6623,"LOL Dave, you may have some years on me, I had to look it up!"
1032658,misfish,2018-08-15 10:14:00,29133, I started with Hydro. Hated it. I just learned to keep the rod tip up and line contact with the float. Much better hook sets as well.
1032660,dave524,2018-08-15 10:26:00,4508,"Dad was a very good tournament caster in the late 40's , both fly and baitcasting accuracy. I learned to cast very early in life with silk fly lines and old Shakespeare/Inglis or Langley direct drive knuckle buster bait casters. Lots of casting skish in the backyard. "
1032679,OhioFisherman,2018-08-15 15:40:00,6623,"Yep, Langley reels I think those were the only baitcasters my dad owned until the 60's, they are what i learned on too. My uncle that lived upstairs with my grandparents went into the navy around 1957 and was in the Mediterranean picked up a couple of mitchell 300's and sent my dad one, then I learned on a spinning reel."
1032699,riddickulous,2018-08-16 03:54:00,27,I've used bloodrun and raven. i like both but prefer bloodrun for ease of use and raven for value. Maybe you need to re-spool your line tighter? could it be digging because the line is not wound tight enough?
1032742,Sharkbait22,2018-08-17 13:34:00,297,Thanks for all the comments and advice.
1032743,misfish,2018-08-17 13:36:00,29133,Do you buy the blood line retail or on line? I would sooner buy retail.
1032744,Sharkbait22,2018-08-17 13:51:00,297,CP Angling. No where sells it in my neck of the woods.  Maybe Gagnon's has it but still rarely get down there.
