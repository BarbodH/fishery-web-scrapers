1032353,steverowbotham,2018-08-08 05:16:00,1800,A couple years back I started saving my used plastics and re using them with various molds I've made. It's saved me a ton of money and recycling is always good! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rx2FD2RBqM&t=15s
1032364,KawarthaAngler,2018-08-08 17:43:00,273,That was quite interesting to see!  Thanks for sharing.
1032372,grimsbylander,2018-08-08 21:42:00,3016,Good of you to post this Steve. I've bought clearout plastics just to melt them down for my use. You can buy metal flakes at Michaels too. Make sure you are using the properly rated ppe!!
1032373,Terry,2018-08-08 21:57:00,14456,Good video
1032384,OhioFisherman,2018-08-09 02:15:00,6623,Pretty cool! Those recycled baits work as well as the name brands?
1032387,Rattletrap2,2018-08-09 02:51:00,1652,"Steve, I had never seen this done before. Very interesting. I used to melt some different halves of torn up baits back together to make new creatures, but  never thought of making molds and melting down old baits to pour new ones. Great video!"
1032389,grimsbylander,2018-08-09 03:46:00,3016,I made my first worm mold around 1989 and used my BBQ to melt down the old plastics! Lol
1032392,Garnet,2018-08-09 11:14:00,2056,I take baits apart glue different elements together make new stuff. This evolved to ejection plaster Paris models . Had lots of fun.
