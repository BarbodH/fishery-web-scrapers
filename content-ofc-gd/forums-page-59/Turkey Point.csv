We are staying at the park next weekend and I am bringing my boat. Fishing on Erie has always been fun but that's the area I've never been to, and wonder if some advice on where to moor the boat and where to go for bass/walleye can be given. Thanks in advance, Black"

1033074,DanD,2018-08-25 21:18:00,2223,Backfield. You were right to post this question here on this site. One of the most informative and friendly sites you'll find. That being said; maybe try here for more responses and up to date info on the inner and outer bay of Long Point Bay area. http://www.longpoint.on.ca/forum/index.php?forums/fishing-reports/ I have a trailer in Normandale (5 minutes from Turkey Point beach and it backs onto the TPPPark) and have fished the bay a lot (30 +years) until I sold my boat. Any help I can give just let me know. Dan.
1033087,blackfield,2018-08-26 01:09:00,8,"Thanks Porkpie and DanD. I don't use riggers, most of the time I cast: tubes, dropshot, senko or cranks. Sometimes I'd use deepsies but not planning to go out far (Erie can be vicious for my 17 footer :-)). For largemouth there, what do you recommend? Topwater, Texas or just tubes? I was thinking of finding some depth drops or rock piles for smallies but folks are saying it's been a tough go for smallies this year. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks again! B."
