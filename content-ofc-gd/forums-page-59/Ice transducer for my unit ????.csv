1032864,PUMP KNOWS,2018-08-21 18:35:00,937,"I’m not sure which one you need but the Humminbird website has Live Chat. Last year I called the Hummingbird factory in Cambridge to find out which ice ducer I needed for mine.  I tried searching for the number but it’s not showing up. Also if you have a brand new transducer and want a ice ducer, the factory can swap it for you free of charge. "
