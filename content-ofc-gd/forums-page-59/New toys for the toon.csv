First was this 55lb thrust tiller bow mount. What to do with this ? No way to rig it on the toon fully assembled. SO, i dismantled it, dismantled the 30 I had, removed the 30 from the mounting bracket, inserted the 55 into it, reassembled ( turning the head so it was in the right position for tillering from the stern. This was much easier then I thought it was going to be. The shaft is 53"". I will probably cut it down, as I am sure it,s more shaft then I need. Bigger is not always better. Always take a pic so you don't get it wrong when you put it back together. ?       The other new toy, HB 598 di hd si, gps finder. Stopped by to see BillM, and he got me hooked up and upgraded. Thanks buddy. Seems I am missing the small chip that goes into the larger one, so a trip down to Radio World is in order. I hope to get this rigged up on the toon this week. Never had a GPS finder, always a way point guy. Look forward to playing with the down imaging and side imaging thing a ma bob. Will be picking up a ice ducer and ice bag later on as well.     "

1032783,misfish,2018-08-18 18:58:00,29133,Shop around. Much cheaper then you think.
1032784,BillM,2018-08-18 19:04:00,17367,Nice man!Â  I had a feeling that shaft came out easily enough.
1032785,misfish,2018-08-18 19:39:00,29133,"Yup, just like you said, except 4 wires. LOL"
1032803,misfish,2018-08-19 16:27:00,29133,"With the new battery and trolling motor, I had to get the balance right. Worked perfect. Me in the front, battery behind me and the long shaft at the back. And does it ever scoot. I will diffidently be cutting the shaft. 10"" off.  "
