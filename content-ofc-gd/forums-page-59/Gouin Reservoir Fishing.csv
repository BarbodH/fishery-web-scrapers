1032834,David Chong,2018-08-20 19:06:00,836,Has anyone here fished up on Gouin Reservoir in Quebec? Just saw that Navionics has partnered up with the management team up there to update the sonar charts. Pretty cool that you might be able to go to a fairly remote location like this and have 1 foot contours showing on your Navionics mapping chip! https://www.navionics.com/usa/blog/post/a-partnership-to-update-gouin-reservoir/
1032840,akaShag,2018-08-20 23:13:00,2073,"Yes I fished the Gouin about twenty years ago, on one of the houseboats with tendered aluminum boats.  I think I must have had a portable graph, but honestly cannot recall.  A Navionics chart would be very helpful indeed."
1032852,David Chong,2018-08-21 13:58:00,836,"Yeah, would definitely be a pleasant surprise on a body of water like that to have a detailed Navionics chart! (-:"
1032888,chris.brock,2018-08-22 03:07:00,4053,"yes, I've been to the Gouin. The biggest concern is all the flooded timber and crap and how to fish it. There's probably 10 billion jigs broken off per acre."
1032911,David Chong,2018-08-22 14:41:00,836,But that's where the fish are! LOL I would rig swimbaits Texas style with a small Ultra Tungsten bullet weight at the nose!
1032961,dave524,2018-08-23 14:13:00,4508,"Even with a very intense data set, 1 foot contour intervals are essentially a guessimation  limited by the experience of the cartographer or today probably the model that a computer program uses."
1033008,chris.brock,2018-08-24 03:13:00,4053,have you ever been to the Guoin Reservoir David Chong?
1033009,chris.brock,2018-08-24 03:16:00,4053,"I'm going away, off the grid so I will reply in advance, yeah, didn't think so"
1033010,David Chong,2018-08-24 03:16:00,836,"No, but have been talking about trying something like that or La Reserve Beauchene with a friend of mine from Quebec! Feeling like I've been missing out on these more remote trip because of commitments to tournaments & such!"
