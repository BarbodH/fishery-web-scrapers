1032213,Pigeontroller,2018-08-04 15:21:00,2793,I found it irresponsible that a major fishing show produced a show fishing for WR size Muskies with Bass gear! Prolonged fights in warm water on light gear is way more harmful to Muskies than slime removal!
1032214,lew,2018-08-04 15:53:00,12766,It's funny you mentioned that Dax I haven't watched a fishing show in years but was flipping thru the TV channels this morning and noticed this show was on so started to watch it and saw the same thing as you where they said they were using bass gear.
1032215,JoshS,2018-08-04 16:00:00,729,"Ya that's unfortunate. Hopefully on the episode they talk about proper catch and release. Now that I watch it again he does get slimed pretty good, could of been a bit smoother for the fish. Bill for sure there's some giants but don't think any one is breaking 60. Mid and maybe the odd higher 50s. I know it's a hell of place to try to do well on. Would love to hear of a 60."
1032352,Moosebunk,2018-08-08 03:07:00,3970,It's an OK fish but maybe it's Angela's biggest and she's just really happy 'bout it. Kidding!! Kidding!!!

1032760,jarrax,2018-08-17 18:43:00,1,I LOVE this episode!!
1032916,FishFishing,2018-08-22 15:28:00,31,"They have another Muskie video up, what do you guys think of this one? Did they do anything wrong this time"
1032934,Pigeontroller,2018-08-22 20:37:00,2793,Confine your trolling to the Lake!
1032936,grimsbylander,2018-08-22 21:23:00,3016,LOL! Oh you'll hear about if they spot something! haha Musky fishing without proper sunscreen protection!! Meh! lol
1032937,buick14,2018-08-22 21:26:00,741,Hahah well said bud

1032127,muskymatt,2018-08-02 21:42:00,2608,I see two things wrong with this post! 
1032129,chris.brock,2018-08-02 22:56:00,4053,"yeah, what's with Ang bear hugging the thing with all the slime ending up on his jacket???"
1032130,Smokercrafty,2018-08-03 00:16:00,227,That's what happens when you can have your sponsor just give you a new jacket! Wash it?? Nahhhhh!!
1032137,chris.brock,2018-08-03 02:08:00,4053,"Yeah, he's likely got a box full of those jackets at home, lol. I'm talking about proper fish handling techniques, especially since that is a highly esteemed, big specimen of a muskie."
1032145,AKRISONER,2018-08-03 10:45:00,5558,"just like the time i went out fishing with a ""muskies canada"" member and his landing process was to net the fish and then throw it on the floor of his boat to unhook it ? to be clear I am not talking about fisherpete lol that guy is a next level fish handler"
1032147,lew,2018-08-03 12:05:00,12766,"Muskies are extremely slimy and big ones  are very strong and holding them in the proper manner isn't always possible and sometime a ""bear hug"" just happens, specially when your alone, but if you hang on tight you should be able to win the struggle hahaha     "
1032150,Acountdeleted,2018-08-03 13:12:00,2562,This was my thought too Chris. This fish could have eventually been a world record........... except you took all the slime off of it and probably killed it.  
1032152,jimmer,2018-08-03 13:43:00,2730,"It doesn't look much bigger than Lew's fish considering it's a great lakes fish (unless Lew's is a great lakes also, lol).  I don't think the fish will die.."
1032154,lew,2018-08-03 13:58:00,12766,Mine was a 52 that came outta Nippissing jimmer.
1032155,Reef Runner,2018-08-03 14:03:00,980,"Without any measurements talk of world record is fruitless, me thinks that was a click bait move. Fish had Shoulders! Nice fish regardless! I've had to bear hug a slimmer or two in my day.  It isn't ""proper"" handling but it happens, worse if he dropped the big girl.  Looks like the fish swam away healthy. That's a dandy fish Lew, super clean."
1032157,AKRISONER,2018-08-03 14:26:00,5558,"lmao ""world record""  i have a feeling the guides on G bay that catch 60""s might have something to say about that."
1032159,lew,2018-08-03 14:37:00,12766,"The St. Lawrence is loaded with monster fish and  holds many, many  ""world record"" size fish, including Lake St. Francis, don't ever rule it out."

1032162,AKRISONER,2018-08-03 14:59:00,5558,"oh that wasnt a slight at those bodies of water, i regularly get photos from fisherpete about them lol  my point was that this fishn canada claiming world record is a joke/clickbait"
1032164,JoshS,2018-08-03 15:04:00,729,If you know of anyone who's caught a 60 on gbay please share! They are just trying to generate some interest. They could of omitted world record talk though. You can't be mad at the fish hold. That's a real nice fish regardless. That fish must of felt great Lew!
1032174,jimmer,2018-08-03 16:24:00,2730,"Are they a great lakes fish in Nippissing? I know they are in the French, but are they same?"
1032175,jimmer,2018-08-03 16:31:00,2730,"I used to be a taxidermist and the largest muskie I mounted was a 57"" fish that weighed in the 40's. Out of the St. Lawrence. Anglers love to exaggerate. LOL That is not close to a record."
1032176,lew,2018-08-03 16:32:00,12766,I honestly don't know jimmer but I spose it's likely as they definitely have similar markings. This is a Lake St. Francis (St. Lawrence River) fish with some very interesting markings.  This is another I got the same day.  And this big girl came from the same area 10 or 12 years ago  
1032177,BillM,2018-08-03 16:42:00,17367,The guys catching monsters on Gbay aren't the sharing kind.    They are being caught however.
1032195,ketchenany,2018-08-04 00:20:00,3229,"in one of my Ontario fishing books (2000)  the record Muskie came out of GBay and was 65 lbs. I don’t have the date at the top of my head, but it was caught by a ‘rookie” he also “hugged” it. need to save them for the future. Lew has done that a for us. Thanks."
1032196,chris.brock,2018-08-04 00:39:00,4053,"Ken O'Brian caught the 65 pounder, Moon River area, in the fall, allegedly 8 or 10 lbs test line and a small Rapala. Ang Viola's fish doesn't seem to be thrashing, he just bear hugs it for no reason in the video.  "
1032197,ketchenany,2018-08-04 00:45:00,3229,I’l l post pictures I have with details. John Kerr was my editor. Chris that sounds right.
1032199,OhioFisherman,2018-08-04 01:12:00,6623,http://www.luckylures.nl/esox_muskellunge_record.php There is a picture of it on that link.
1032204,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-04 04:27:00,8243,I must have missed the Cooooper Tire and Dodge Ram plugs during the world record catch somehow. Fake news boys and girls. Fake news.
