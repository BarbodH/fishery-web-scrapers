1033022,Tom S,2018-08-24 14:21:00,362,Good. Thin out some of those cormorant colonies. Hopefully it doesn't affect to many other species.
1033024,OhioFisherman,2018-08-24 14:44:00,6623,"For sure, since it seems to affect poultry too it could cause havoc?"
1033025,grimsbylander,2018-08-24 15:05:00,3016,I don't like to see any wild animal suffer so I hope they figure out a remedy...then open a shotgun season. I wonder if the geese are at any risk. Those cobra chickens walk around down there like they own it. Haha
1033033,Mike Pike,2018-08-24 19:18:00,1332,"Earlier this year, I was carp fishing along a quiet shore of Hammy Harbour.  All of a sudden, around the wooded shoreline comes a dozen, then a hundred, then thousands of cormorants.  I'd had never seen such a big migration of the birds, and they all began landing and settling down right in front of me.  After I got over the spectacle before me, I got up, moved towards the water and waved my net over my head frantically.  This seemed to spook a few, then more, and then in unison, thousands of them took off like they were never there. Quite something to witness. "
