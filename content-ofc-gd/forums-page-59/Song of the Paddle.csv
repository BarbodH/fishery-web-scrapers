Since then I’ve watched most of his films, own a few on DVD. Path of the Paddle is good, I also enjoy Waterwalker. Strange, just last week I picked up his biography called ‘Fire in the Bones’ off my bookshelf at home for a re-read. I’ve always had a lot of admiration for the guy."
1032951,kickingfrog,2018-08-23 01:34:00,8333,"The other one I remember from school is Paddle to the Sea. Many (all?) of his National Film Board films are available online. The film Waterwalker has a closing scene that is one of my favourites, and with Bruce Cockburn singing over the credits. Haunting.  "

We camped there on the way down a few years back---hooked my 1 and only musky in that pool.  The boys with us got a big  charge out of that---lost it at the shore, which was OK too."
1032997,woodenboater,2018-08-24 01:26:00,2277,Waterwalker has a really good soundtrack (Hugh Marsh and Bruce Cockburn) and shows some great scenery of Lake Superior and its rivers.
