1032292,b_cdot,2018-08-06 20:58:00,270,This bait is absolutely awesome for smallmouth. Who has gotten on the train? I know it's not that new but I am hooked! Curious with how you like to fish it. Jigheads? plastics? weights? setups? depths? cover? presentations? This bait is outfishing all of my other traditional smallie presentations right now. It's also a killer bait for jumbo perch lol!

1032294,b_cdot,2018-08-06 21:32:00,270,Oh no! I'm that dude eh? Hahaha!
1032297,grimsbylander,2018-08-07 00:43:00,3016,"Lol We've ALL been ""that dude""! So much great material on OFC it's easy to miss a thread."
1032306,Chuck Enwinde,2018-08-07 05:54:00,247,"TOOT! TOOT!  I was using a piece of a Hula Stik as a drop shot bait for smallies at a buddies cottage.  Over the weekend it probably caught 50 smallies,  and I never had to change the bait once.   I went through two or three packs of senkos and probably would have gone through a few more if hadn't switched.  I got to thinking , this will be great for perching.   Oh, and a trick shot on a mushroom head =$."
1032322,BillM,2018-08-07 18:24:00,17367,"So this is basically what I do with crappie baits when I'm bored and don't bother switching up, lol.   Lots of fun, catches everything especially big bass. 2in Lunker City Fin-S minnow on a 1/8 or 1/16oz head.   Takes FOREVER to sink, lol."
1032333,b_cdot,2018-08-07 21:44:00,270,I've been using the trick shotZ for my drop shot bait and I've used the same one for about 20 fish. I am nose hooking it. Hasn't ripped or flung off on any of 'em yet. Hard to buy other baits when you get your money's worth with all this elaztech stuff

1032489,Dutch01,2018-08-10 23:10:00,1431,Thank you Sir! I don't know why I didn't think of that before ?
1032490,OhioFisherman,2018-08-10 23:12:00,6623,For a different look try them on a 1/8th ounce roadrunner head.
