1032358,fisher,2018-08-08 12:38:00,451,Heading to Big Bald lake in a couple of weeks and wondered if anyone has any tips on the fishing and can suggest a public or private boat launch on the lake.  Ill be renting a cottage located on saunders rd on the north east side of the lake. Any launches close by?
1032361,KawarthaAngler,2018-08-08 17:06:00,273,You are close to Catalina Bay Resort.  There is a launch there.  Also a restaurant. You're also not far from Oak Shores.  I believe there is a launch there.  But you are probably better off going to Catalina Bay Resort.
1032452,Hank Jr,2018-08-10 13:31:00,146,We haven't fished Big Bald for several years but when Pigeon Lake gets real windy we fish Bald . We are Muskie fisherman and usually boat a couple Muskies and bigger Bass on our Muskie lures there . Plenty of rocky ledges and weeds to fish . Good Luck

(Haven't seen him on here lately) but he took me out a few hours before sundown and managed 2 nice ones in the 40"" range casting weed beds along the shores, from memory we were using a few double 10's and some big tube baits"
1032483,David Chong,2018-08-10 22:23:00,836,Catalina Bay Resort is where we've launched in the past! Check out the Navionics web app or the Navionics app on your phone or tablet and you'll see quite a number of fishing spots shared by the Navionics community! A fair number of them are spots that I've fished on Big Bald Lake! Best of luck!
