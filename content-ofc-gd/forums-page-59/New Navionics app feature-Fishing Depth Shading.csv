You can select up to 5 different depth ranges to shade in different colours! This was tremendously helpful to me and my partners as we plan for tournaments and are looking for new areas of a lake to scout! Your mobile or tablet Navionics app must be up to date and as well as your Navionics+ subscription. I've attached a few screen shots of some popular Kawartha lakes.    "
1032756,grimsbylander,2018-08-17 17:41:00,3016,Great tool for fisherman that take the time to determine patterns. Having the capability live on the water enables anglers to search out new water quickly based on discoveries made that very day. Very cool. I don't see the Chonger Waypoints button??
1032757,David Chong,2018-08-17 17:43:00,836,That's on the secret layer! LOL
1032758,BillM,2018-08-17 18:37:00,17367,"Dave, does this transfer over to the units or is this just for the app/PC?"
1032761,David Chong,2018-08-17 19:48:00,836,This is only for the mobile & tablet apps! Available on both Apple & Android platforms!
1032774,Dan668,2018-08-18 02:02:00,1120,"Ive been using it. I wish the cards on the units had this functionality or atleast have the ability like Lakemaster, green and red highlights."

1032833,David Chong,2018-08-20 18:55:00,836,"My understanding is that the Navionics chip already has this ready to go but as far as usage in different units, the electronics manufacturers are the ones who must allow this feature to appear. If you happen to have a Garmin unit and are using their LakeVu chip then you can actually shade up to 10 depth ranges."
1032998,SirCranksalot,2018-08-24 01:39:00,3291,I understood a few years back that Navionics for a smart phone was quite cheap ($25-$30). I guess that's no longer the case . Everything on their website seems to be $100 + 
1032999,David Chong,2018-08-24 01:47:00,836,The Navionics Boating App for an iPhone for USA & Canada should be about $20-$21 on the App Store! You can't buy the mobile app on the Navionics site. The prices that you see there are for chips for chartplotters and update chips. You have to go to the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android for the mobile app? Now the HD version for iPads are more costly.

1033004,chris.brock,2018-08-24 02:10:00,4053,are you affiliated or somehow getting paid or compensation  from navionics? 
1033006,David Chong,2018-08-24 02:58:00,836,Hey Chris if that question is for me!? Navionics is one of my many sponsors!
1033007,chris.brock,2018-08-24 03:07:00,4053,"no the question was for jesus,  not you, ????"
