We've been doing Nipissing for quite a few years now but are thinking about changing it up this year. I'm looking for suggestions on a good place to go this winter. We typically stay on the ice but we are open to a cottage as long as it is in close proximity to fishing grounds. Our target species isn't that important as long as the fishing is decent but we would prefer Walleye, Lakers or Pike. We would like to keep the drive within 5-6 hours of the GTA. If anyone could help us out with a suggestion that would be great. Please feel free to PM me if you dont want to post it here. Thanks so much guys. Cheers"
