1032026,Garry2Rs,2018-07-31 23:02:00,1425,The colour in PowerPro is basically a wax.  Other brands use dyes. The fiber used doesn't hold dye.  Over time the colour washes out. Loss of colour has little effect on line strength.
1032488,David Chong,2018-08-10 22:34:00,836,"You definitely don't need to replace braided line nearly as often as monofilament, I do it annually but most people can probably get away with changing every couple of years! Most braids will fade, some more than others but it doesn't affect the strength of the line. In fact, it is very useful if you are a line watcher which every angler should be, I colour the last 4-5 feet with a Sharpie Magnum Marker and don't worry about the faded portion!"
1032510,grimsbylander,2018-08-11 19:30:00,3016,Sitting in 4th place after day one at the Port Colborne B1 tournament and David takes time to contribute on OFC!! Weigh in starts LIVE on the Berkley B1 website at 3:30pm. Good Luck David!!

1032516,grimsbylander,2018-08-11 20:37:00,3016,I wish!! Next year back to tournament fishing! So hard to just watch!
1032517,misfish,2018-08-11 20:47:00,29133,That was a close finish. Thanks for posting the tourny.
1032518,grimsbylander,2018-08-11 20:51:00,3016,Yeah so close. Perry's a good guy and strong on Erie.
1032529,David Chong,2018-08-12 12:33:00,836,Thanks guys! It was a very close finish and these local sticks are extremely tough to beat! Congrats to Matt & Daaron as well as Perry & Caitlyn on a great tournament!
1032542,grimsbylander,2018-08-12 19:58:00,3016,"You had an excellent showing considering how tough that bite was. Congrats!!! I stayed off the lake Friday and Saturday so I wouldn't fish any of the same spots a tournament team needed. Today, the lake was quiet and dead calm until around 1:30pm when a small SW breeze picked up. David, did you mark a ton of fish that just wouldn't go?? That was the theme for today...all my spots held good fish from 12 feet out to 40 feet but they either outright ignore the bait or all you feel is a tick and they're gone. Tough conditions right now. I got fish but nothing over 4 - 4 1/2 and not the usual numbers."
1032551,David Chong,2018-08-13 01:00:00,836,"Thanks Grimsbylander! Appreciate the respect by staying off the water, it was a tough bite but we just kept grinding it out! Lots of other local sticks didn't do as well as expected! Not surprised as everything is about 3-4 weeks behind, should ramp up soon! Best of luck! Sorry for hijacking this thread!"
1032560,Garnet,2018-08-13 10:23:00,2056,Fact all braid fades. Fact the bottom of your spool is brand new braid. Let's be creative tie your braid to a tree walk your braid off. Snip with scissors back to your tree tie braid on wind on reel and your pervious faded braid is all new.
1032571,misfish,2018-08-13 14:57:00,29133,"David, when I seen Simon and Mel come up on the stage, I said, here comes a big bag.   Must of been tough out there."
1032573,David Chong,2018-08-13 15:09:00,836,Absolutely Garnet! Great tip for saving money by flipping your braid around and reusing your braid!
1032575,grimsbylander,2018-08-13 16:01:00,3016,Yeah great tip. I've done it before by going from one reel directly to another as well.
1032577,Garnet,2018-08-13 16:33:00,2056,"I worked every show for Power Pro for 10 years be for it was bought out. And have worked for another Canadian braid company . I still don't waste braid. It's some what environmental thing. I take flap of box and cut notches in end, wind the braid on and write the lb test. To be used another day. "
1032585,misfish,2018-08-13 20:16:00,29133,"That red braid I was talking about, I can tell you where and when I bought it and still have it on 3 reels that get used all the time. Bought it at walmart state side when I fished the CFT tourny out of Chippawa. I fished the 2 day with Frost and with you David. Remember that down pour.Oh and the 6-8 ft rollers. Lost my lightening rod off the back of the boat that day as well."
1032595,Garnet,2018-08-13 22:12:00,2056,I can tell you the year red came out we sold crap loads of it. The next year couldn't give it away.
1032597,misfish,2018-08-13 22:30:00,29133,"Well if you have some, I want some. LOL I did find the coating on it was thicker then then the original green power pro, but once it,s been tamed, it casts so smooth."
1032607,Garnet,2018-08-14 10:06:00,2056,We are getting ready for weekend yard sale never know what I might find. Set of glory bags I knew where.....just not where.
1032610,grimsbylander,2018-08-14 17:35:00,3016,^^^^ I think I need your glory bags
1032617,misfish,2018-08-14 20:16:00,29133,"Where,is where? Do you remember where ?  EWWWWWWWWW ?"
1032618,grimsbylander,2018-08-14 20:33:00,3016,lol
1032620,Garnet,2018-08-14 20:50:00,2056,I know where now.
1031528,Acountdeleted,2018-07-22 13:31:00,2562,Hey everyone. For the past 2 to 3 seasons I have really been enjoying using braided line for the first time in my life. I’ve noticed better hooksets and less lost fish. After 4 days camping and leaving my rods out in the sun (no choice) my dark green line looks like it’s faded to a brighter tan. Am I just seeing things or does braided line fade? If it does will it effect the fishing? Will fish see this off colour? How often does everyone replace their braid? Thanks.
1031531,OhioFisherman,2018-07-22 13:53:00,6623,"http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/tips/post/recolor-your-braided-line-with-a-sharpie and there is this https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Vicious_No-Fade_Braid_Moss_Green/descpage-VNFB.html I am older and have used everything from braided nylon to flouro and have caught fish on them all, my line of choice was original Stren over the years, the line watchers line. If I could see it? I assume the fish could too? LOL, it's an easy excuse to blame a bad day on the fish being able to see your line? I have no idea what a fish may think line is, or why they would avoid line and not hook shaped objects?"
1031532,Acountdeleted,2018-07-22 14:02:00,2562,This is awesome! Thanks. Gonna try the first technique and if that doesn’t work i’ll Invest in the second.  Its funny because i would have thought what you said about the line as well until I had a buddy using sand white on Quinte one day. I think I landed 5 or 6 quality bass while he didn’t get a bite. It was odd. Also i’ll Use any excuse in the book if they fish aren’t biting. ‘It’s too hot’ ‘it’s too cold’ ‘it’s too shallow’ ‘the wind was blowing the wrong direction’ ‘It was to early’ ‘it was too late’. I feel like I could make one of those t-shirts.
1031533,OhioFisherman,2018-07-22 14:13:00,6623,"Years ago there was a golden Stren, and it was pretty obvious. It didn't seem to matter on a trip up north were your water is generally much clearer than ours here. The flouro was a tough bite line for me, and I am not sure if it made a difference, generally the bite was still tough. LOL, I have caught fish right over the side of the boat and other days on a long cast, some days they were afraid of the boat? "
1031549,misfish,2018-07-22 17:57:00,29133,LOL I still have a reel spooled with red power pro. (wish I could find it again ) Been on my reel 10 years. Oh I have caught many a fish with it. Bass to lakers and whities. Faded or not. STOP OVER THINKING.  HA HA HA HA
1031552,Garnet,2018-07-22 18:29:00,2056,I'm not telling how many rods have yellow braid on it's a big number! Turn your braid around and nice new braid.
1031554,Acountdeleted,2018-07-22 19:59:00,2562,"My co-worker made a good point. Those of you who commented, do you use a fluro leader? I’ve been tying my braid right on to the hook like a boat anchor."
1031555,misfish,2018-07-22 20:04:00,29133,Jer I tie direct to my spinner baits. The rest is floro leaders.
1031556,chris.brock,2018-07-22 20:07:00,4053,"I use a pretty long flouro leader. Ice fishing, Lake Trout for sure seem to shy away from my offering if I've tied direct."
1031557,Acountdeleted,2018-07-22 20:52:00,2562,"Sooooooo, not for senkos? ...... wait, do you use senkos? Through the ice for lakers for sure. I dunno why i’m Ok with a fluro leader for that and not soft water. Superstition I guess. XD"
1031558,BillM,2018-07-22 21:08:00,17367,Only type of fishing I do with no leads is frogging..  Everything else gets a flouro or mono leader of some kind.
1031559,wallyboss,2018-07-22 21:10:00,1095,I always have a black marker in my tackle box and every once in a while I darken the faded out last 2-4 feet.  But most of my setups I use yellow braid because of my colorblindness and can't linewatch on the dark green or red braid
1031570,porkpie,2018-07-23 10:53:00,2521,I have a reel that I bought when the bass pro shop first opened in Vaughan.  I'm pretty sure it's still wearing the original braid.  Still use it and couldn't tell you the original colour.  Every so often I remove a foot or so of braid and tie on a new Fluoro leader.  I only replace if I get a bad fray or have some sort of operator related catastrophic failure.
1031572,misfish,2018-07-23 10:58:00,29133,"Senkos in heavy cover,I will tie direct. They don't hesitate on the hit."
1031573,BassMan11,2018-07-23 11:25:00,583,As walleyboss mentioned the black permanent marker on the last 2-4' works well if you are worried about the fading... saw this tip from KVD on the fishing channel.. i'd say if it works for him it must work well. Lakers and super clear water fishing i'll use a floro leaders.  
1031575,AKRISONER,2018-07-23 12:41:00,5558,"ding ding ding if im fishing slop with whacky rigs, i still double uni to a piece of 20lb flurocarbon"
1031607,riddickulous,2018-07-23 19:14:00,27,"I also use a fluoroleader. Plus i use mono backing. I learned the hard way that tying braid on straight is a bad idea - fishing in the rain, i was wondering why my drag kept slipping, turns out my whole line was turning on the spool. You can also tie a piece of electrical tape, but by using cheaper mono, i can make my spool of braid last longer. Just remember to hide the knot (i like putting it on the back edge of the spool."
1031861,Rattletrap2,2018-07-28 02:19:00,1652,"Interesting! I finally gave in and tried braid on a few reels late last year and now this year too. I am liking the Suffix 832. I have noticed the fading and have my jumbo black marker (Thanks KVD!) but have not tried it yet. I do use a Fluoro leader for finesse fishing or really any slow presentation. Like Misfish, I tie the braid straight to Spinner Baits. I think any fast reaction type presentation does not need the low visibility leader. The old Spider wire braids from 20 years ago were horrible for breaking down of the wax like coating on the line. This is what scared me off from using them. The new lines are way better now."
1031964,msp,2018-07-30 19:03:00,1336,The suffix 832 turn white almost immediately. The line casts great but a little to supple for my liking. It tends to wrap around the guides way to much. I rarely use a flouro leader. Power pro is by far the best braid out there. It does turn white eventually. not as quick as 832 . A black marker takes care of this.  
1031969,misfish,2018-07-30 20:20:00,29133,"I,ll post a pic tomorrow of faded line that still works. Its  bright red power pro. It,s white now. Fish don't seem to care. LOL"
1031970,Lape0019,2018-07-30 20:54:00,647,"Unlike everyone else, I only use a leader when Dropshotting. Everything else is tied direct.  7 of 10 of my combos have braid. The other three have mono. They are 2 cranking sticks and my spinnerbait/buzzbait rod."
1031977,Acountdeleted,2018-07-30 22:38:00,2562,You fish 300 ft below the surface bud. Do fish even have eyes when they live down that deep? XD XD
1031990,Yellow Fever,2018-07-31 10:59:00,139,"Been a straight braid guy for years, I use 30 lb for trolling and 20lb for casting, my braid is now white from fading...I can't break it so I figure it's ok. Trim the last foot and re-tie"
1032007,DropShot'r,2018-07-31 15:38:00,62,"D/S rod - 10lb braid with 7 or 5lb fluorocarbon leader. Plastics rod - 20lb braid with 7 or 10lb fluorocarbon leader Spinnerbait/swim jig rod  - 15lb Big Game Deep diver rod - 12lb fluorocarbon Squarebill rod - 10lb fluorocarbon Topwater rod - 10lb Big Game Punching rod, Flipping rod, Frog rod  - 65lb braid "
1032008,misfish,2018-07-31 16:04:00,29133,The 10 ft of floro helps a bit.  Forgot to take a pic. Tooooo busy hitting lakers.
