1032762,scottyiam,2018-08-17 20:11:00,5,Has anyone been to antlers kingfisher lodge on the Ottawa river? I can't seem to find very much info on the fishing there besides their website. It's about a 40 min drive from mattawa.
1032775,BillM,2018-08-18 02:28:00,17367,Friends just got back from Deep River (A bit downstream)  Pike and bass everywhere.
1032780,scottyiam,2018-08-18 15:05:00,5,That's a good sign since we love fishing for bass and we don't mind pike either . Hopefully we'll catch a few walleye to eat. Mostly looking forward to the peace and quiet of getting up north.
1032792,captpierre,2018-08-19 12:16:00,2521,Don’t know specific details of this place or stretch of the Ottawa River but the last time I fished the river I hit rocks. Water levels change thanks to hydro dams. Be careful.
1032797,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-19 15:00:00,8243,We had a camp on the Ottawa for years.  Not only rocks are a hazard also because of the many years of logging deadheads can appear out of nowhere. If you don't know where to run up down fast water in the boat don't bother unless you bring plenty of spare props and bottom ends.
1032835,scottyiam,2018-08-20 19:07:00,5,Thanks for all the replies it looks like we'll have to be careful as always and i'm sure the camp owner will let us know of the hazards on that part of the river.
