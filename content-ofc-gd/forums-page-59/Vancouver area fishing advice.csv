Would love to go on a charter, but prices are similar to port credit charters = pricey! Thanks in advance"

1032690,misfish,2018-08-15 21:50:00,29133,MJL ( mikey ) is your man for this. He did a great report a couple of years ago here.
1032691,huzzsaba,2018-08-15 22:48:00,884,Thanks.  I read about Capilano river.  Will definitely check it out I will try to get in touch with him.  thanks
1032706,craigdritchie,2018-08-16 13:52:00,1586,Detailed PM sent.
1032715,Headhunter,2018-08-16 17:42:00,5703,"I was in BC last week. I can't help with this fishing, but I will suggest that you invest in some sort of smoke repellent/face mask as the fires are out of control and everywhere! We could smell smoke on Vancouver Island all week long. I understand that it is even worse now than when I was there. HH"
1032716,BillM,2018-08-16 17:44:00,17367,Google is an amazing tool.  http://www.sea-run.com/beach-salmon-vancouver/
1032719,Sinker,2018-08-16 19:48:00,8692,Try the fraser river for sturgeon. You can catch all the salmon you want right here in your back yard. Same fish.  Can't catch sturgeon here.....legally.  S.
1032726,BillM,2018-08-16 21:23:00,17367,Not unless you're way up north on a fly-in.
1032737,Sinker,2018-08-17 03:17:00,8692,Hes in vancouver. The sturgeon fishing is a blast.  Do we have giant sea run white sturgeon in ontario? Didnt think so....lol  Salmon there are the same as here. Ours might even be bigger on average.  S.
1032751,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-17 16:42:00,8243,"I as well was in B.C. fishing last week, below Cayuga. Have a great trip Huzz."
1032759,BillM,2018-08-17 18:39:00,17367,"I guess you missed my point, there are open sturgeon seasons in Ontario    But you'll most likely have to fly to them. And yeah, I'd definitely hit the Fraser out there for sturgeon, salmon are everywhere."
1032773,huzzsaba,2018-08-18 01:42:00,884,"Thanks for your detailed PM Craig.  Was very useful! Thanks to everyone else for their replies. I'm actually staying in Abbotsford but was planning to check out Vancouver.  Was hoping there was some type of Pier like they have here along Lake O, but seems its mostly beach fishing.  Wish there was some of that here!  Would be fun! I think Capilano river (Ambleside beach) is an option I may try if I get a chance. Will surely post back if I catch anything!"
