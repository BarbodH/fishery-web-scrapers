1032883,wantabigone,2018-08-22 00:47:00,97,Hello OFNers.  I have lost all my tabs when my hard drive recently crashed. I am looking for the camp located between ARA and Meta lake. There was a cabin on the point in the channel between the 2 lakes. I think this camp was sold recently. Perhaps it is no longer being rented? 
1032884,gordy28,2018-08-22 00:51:00,638,Hey there I think the meta channel cabin is now owned by Meta Lake lodge or at the very least Meta LL operates an outpost in the channel http://www.metalakelodgefishing.com/channel-view-outpost.html Hope this helps Cheers Gordy
