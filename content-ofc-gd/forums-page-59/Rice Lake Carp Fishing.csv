1032494,Kokemachine,2018-08-11 10:11:00,8,"Hello, I am new to this board so I'll introduce myself: I am an avid fisherman and regular YouTuber heralding from the great city of North Bay. I go by the name Kokemachine and my youtube channel is called 4 Eel Fishing.  My content is mostly fishing reports but I also enjoy making comedic and educational fishing animations. Anyway, I had the opportunity to visit Rice Lake this past spring on a quest for the giant brown beasts. My friends and I fished for 3 days on these carp filled waters and caught many greasy giants.  All the fish were over 10lbs with our biggest at 26lbs. Here's my first vid from the trip with 2 more videos coming in the future. Hard Carpin' On Rice Lake (Day 1)  For anyone who wants to try carp fishing but don't know where to start check out this animated video: Simple Rigging And Baits For Ontario Carp This pic is of one my buddies with his catch."

1032646,Kokemachine,2018-08-15 00:52:00,8,Thanks Mike Pike. I'm going to have 2 more episodes from this trip coming soon. Thanks for good words on my animation.  It takes a long time to put it all together but it's fun. ************ Thanks Dusky. If you look back into some of my older videos you'll find a bunch of other fishing related animations that I've created if you are interested.
1032779,Toronto_Angler,2018-08-18 14:11:00,698,This is great! Love carp fishing and the kids go nuts when the beasts just start ripping line. Always a fun day out!
1032798,wantabigone,2018-08-19 15:09:00,97,nice video-thanks for taking the time. I have had NO success in my 2 carp outings this year-much to my sons dismay. (and mine)
