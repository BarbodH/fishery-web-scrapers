I have not fished this lake in ages, used to be my favourite local lake as it holds monster walleye, decent Lake Trout and bass, all catchable with a jig and minnow and good use of your electronics. The walleye are still there but in nowhere near the numbers of years gone by. Pulling a worm harness or bottom bouncer would work well as they are fewer and further between, but I like jigging. I keep a close watch on the screen and get ready to hit Spot Lock as soon as I see a fish...good fun chasing active fish  around the structure as they move around hoovering upon the bait fish. Got into a 25"" and 26"" and a bunch of 18"" to 22""ers  before switching over to lakers. Jigged up one of the lakers and then threw a bunch of sinkers on top of a bottom bouncer and trolled a William 's spoon for the second one.  "
