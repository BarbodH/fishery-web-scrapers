24853,solopaddler,2007-01-21 16:40:00,8605,Who would have thought that there'd be enough interest to build an indoor ski hill in Dubai of all places? That really is incredible
24854,Garyv,2007-01-21 16:43:00,547,TJ..just sent you some picture of that place via email about 10 minutes ago.  I say keep your freekin ski hill and sell us oil at a reasonable price.  Perhaps the next time we have to defend these guys we will have to declare that monument to decadence a sacred site.  Oh heck I'm just mad cause I  filled up both vehicles today!!
24862,TJQ,2007-01-21 17:08:00,7806,"Ya gary...  Thats why I posted it... lol...  Its likely they would say the same thing about our sun tanning booths, strip joints and bars....  I thought just the fact that they sell ""disposable socks"" was hilarious... but I guess if you wear sandles all the time.. who needs socks??"
24864,Garyv,2007-01-21 17:23:00,547,"  Just for your info,  Strip joints are considered off limits for any attacking force. Their listed as morale boosters in the Geneva convention!."
24870,Crazyhook,2007-01-21 17:51:00,1154,have to make the people happy!
24952,Pinch,2007-01-22 00:56:00,231,"I'm surprised that the lift pass was only $75 cdn for the day for everything, including disposable socks!!"
24959,cisco,2007-01-22 01:24:00,597,"Watched a TV documentary on that country a while ago. The head honchos there have decided to use all their dwindling oil reserve revenues to build the worlds foremost tourist destination.  I recall the show saying that an apartment building/skyskraper is completed about every coupla minutes or so. Their even building a connected tourism-focused island complex that is so huge it's easily picked up by satelites.  ""Build it and they will come"". Any idea how many rich/middleclass folks haven't experienced snow?  A guy I know just returned from there. He was staying at a pal's condo and different beautiful 'girls' would knock on his door in the morning. Kinda like door-to-door salespersons..... he says their rates weren't bad either! LOL!  I bet lotsa big executive types will enjoy holding their annual meetings there due to such perks...."
25083,blaque,2007-01-22 13:56:00,2419,"yEp Cisco, the man made island is called ""Palms of Dubai"". To see the building of the land mass itself is incredible. Wouldnt catch me buying property on a man made island sticking its neck out into one of mother natures oceans lol."
25188,TJQ,2007-01-22 18:01:00,7806,  LOL.. ya theres likely a reason there want an island there in the first place....
