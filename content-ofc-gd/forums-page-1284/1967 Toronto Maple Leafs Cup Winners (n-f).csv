This celebration will be extra special because word is that a former captain, one of the greatest leafs ever and MVP of those 1967 playoffs, Dave Keon, will be attending the ceremonies after a decades long boycott of the Leafs organization.  Did I mention DAVE KEON   will attend the festivities.  I was very young, but remember having collected Dave's hockey card, along with others way back in the 70's. Being a lifelong Maple Leafs fan, it brought a tear to my eye to think a great hockey legend like Keon will be back with the leafs to celebrate that last cup win.  I hope this isn't just a nasty joke."

24782,Carp,2007-01-21 06:41:00,1488,Maybe we should ask if they want to play a few more games for us Roy.

24850,camillj,2007-01-21 16:29:00,1988,"Funny thing Lew ... but in those days it was long hair, sideburns, denim vests, terra-firma's, platform shoes, velvet shirts and bellbottoms ... now it brushcuts (its been a number two crew-cut for me for the past 10 years at least)"

24910,bucktail,2007-01-21 21:53:00,1857,I am not sure I would be celebrating this accomplishment. Its kinda like celebrating graduating high school when your 30!
