24183,dsn,2007-01-19 06:47:00,1018,Nice CC. Too bad about your rod. I know those rod are exspensive. Must have been a real monster the one that got away. A fishing net? Don't recall seeing you even use a net before?  Or is it something I missed?   dsn

24200,Harrison,2007-01-19 12:21:00,2202,"ouch..I have anxiety with landing pier fish with nets.  Leaves ya responsible for hitting the net man between the eyes too...  Did the same thing on Wed., holding the rod sideways guiding the fish into the net, rip, smack off a rock.   Have a sweet perch ice blank atleast.  R.I.P - Cormor 13fter.  1998- 2007  Best damn winter long rod."

24209,ccmtcanada,2007-01-19 13:14:00,7971,Awesome CC!  I wish I could fish during the daylight...LOL.  I saw a float in one of your pics....does bottom fishing work too?  I'm assuming since the tribs...at least the smaller ones are low and clear that they are hanging around structure near the trib mouth...I'll have to try that this weekend maybe...
24210,Roy,2007-01-19 13:16:00,13728,"Always amazing shots, Scott. I'd recognize that net anywhere."
