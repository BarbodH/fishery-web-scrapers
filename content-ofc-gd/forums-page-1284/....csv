24859,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-21 17:02:00,957,"Aqua-Vu is a good unit.  Go with opinions of TJ and TG, not some Duckhntr from mn.  Only problem I have is that I fish mostly stained water.  I've lined up some clear water fishing in coming weeks.  Aqua-Vu holds up well in nasty weather.  My salesperson sells both black underwater viewing systems and yellow underwater systems and he told me that ole yeller pees out when it rains.  I'd welcome another opinion on that one."
