23756,pikehunter,2007-01-18 10:54:00,1659,"If some of you remember I made a  post about my cataract operation about 2 weeks ago. Today it's back to the O.R to get my right eye taken care of, unbelievably fast at getting back in! The hospital(s) have received some additional funds to move these proceedures along quicker. When all this trouble began I was told to expect about a 6 month wait to get the my right eye cataract removed.  I was very reluctant with going ahead with the first operation because of this, so I put it off for about a year and my wait payed off. The problem is that my vision is so poor that there is a great difference between both eyes now. After the operation the left eye (repaired one) now has near 20/20 vision! My right eye is still something like  -11, wich is very bad. So I see double at times or half the world is fogged over and the other half clear or all kinds of strange things happen. In fact about 3 years ago I had a retinal detachment in the left eye and unfortunately 2 weeks after that happened I had a chance to work at Casino Niagara but failed the medical exam partly because I only had 40% eyesight in that eye. The eye sureon is amazed at such an improvement!  Last week I tried driving in the dark, forget it, every car coming at me had a twin right alongside of it up on the shoulder! Daytime driving is better although not that good.  Since my work involves driving I have taken the shotgun seat and haven't been to work since this all began. The bright side is that next week I have 2 job interviews to look forward to!  I know that one of them is a give in, the other is pretty much a done deal too as it is my 2nd time in to talk to them and this time is with one of the owners.  So lots of things will be new! New eyes, a new year and a new job! I'm re-born at 50!  Thanks for listening OFNers!"
23758,Rich Clemens,2007-01-18 11:09:00,3131,I hear of many folks getting their eyes corrected with all this new technology with excellent results.  Sounds like a highly successful first surgery for you and we'll pray your second surgery will be just as successful.  My best to ya !
23759,motv8tr,2007-01-18 11:26:00,2587,"Good stuff Pikehunter, I hope this second one goes as well as the first...  Good luck Maureen"
23761,lew,2007-01-18 11:55:00,12767," Harry, that's the most up-lifting post I've read in a very long time.  Good luck with todays procedure and all the best with so many great things happening in your future.  Nice things happen to nice people"

23771,ccmtcanada,2007-01-18 12:38:00,7971,Good luck!!! I'm sure it will be as successful as your other eye and you'll be back to 20/20 soon!
23816,Beans,2007-01-18 15:43:00,3339,About ten years ago (age 60) when I went to an opthamologist for an eye exam to see if my newly found diabetes had caused any damage he informed me that I had the beginnings of cataracts and that he would prob have to operate on them before he retires in about 25 years...I should live so long!!!   I get them checked annually now...  Good to hear your operation was successful and I hope your next goes as well...  Encouraging for us that's looking at the same ... Thanks
23852,Rob,2007-01-18 17:19:00,467,good to hear that things went well for you PH!!  Rob C
24308,pikehunter,2007-01-19 19:31:00,1659,"Thanks for the good wishes.  Surgery went ahead and the Doc says the all looks OK. It does look though that my vision is not as clear as it was after the first one was done. He says though that it will get better. I will probably require some additional laser work to be done as I see some things double through the first one that was done first, he will wait to find out how the second eye heals.  Thanks again guys.  Happy fishing."
24311,douG,2007-01-19 19:44:00,2693,"Thanks for the update, Pikehunter.  Hope all continues to go well."
24313,wuchikubo,2007-01-19 19:47:00,1114,"Pikehunter, I hope you heal quick and smoothly."
24320,fishnsled,2007-01-19 20:25:00,3520,"Glad to hear that things went well.  I've had 6 lazer treaments on my eyes in the past 12 months.  Done for now, go back for a check up in 4 months.  I've got a condition call ""lattice degeneration"" which can lead to a retinal detachment if not treated.  Might be the same thing that lead to yours.  Good luck with the recovery and take care of those peeper!  Fishnsled."

24398,Rich Clemens,2007-01-20 02:28:00,3131,You'll get 'em working together in no time.  Hoping for the best for ya
24538,ehg,2007-01-20 18:38:00,2666,"Good luck with all that! Two months ago I lost vision in left eye due to MS, slowly regaining sight however. Went fishing once since then and casted like crap.  Soon you will be good to go.  cheers,  ehg"
24652,pikehunter,2007-01-20 23:59:00,1659,"Wow! I hope that they can do something for you to help restore more of your eyesight. It is coming along so that is a good sign. Maybe this coming fishing season you will be a little more comfortable and can do better with your casting. I wish you all the best.  Take care, Harry"
