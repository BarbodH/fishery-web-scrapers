25057,out2llunge,2007-01-22 13:16:00,13,"The Recovery  Well, yesterday was another interesting day as a salvage crew came to recover the sleds from the lake in front of my place. The guy who went through is a super nice guy who kept apologizing (and thanking us for the 911 call) to us and realized how, well foolish it was to head out.  One of the funniest things that happened during the day was the hordes of sledders that came to watch. About a dozen at a time would stop by and all park beside one another (on about 3 - 4"" of ice). we joked about lucky they were that the salvage crews were already there. Luckily nobody else went through.  Here's an instructional video that I hope nobody will ever need.  "
25084,Smokey,2007-01-22 13:59:00,1278,Great work on the video JP. I'm hoping they used the ice they pushed under to refill the hole with before they left.  Mike
25097,dsn,2007-01-22 14:24:00,1018,  Yeah I was thinking the same thing Mike that way it'll freeze faster sealing the thin gaps from the block instead of the major hole.   Great job on the vid. I learned something new today.
25106,Joey,2007-01-22 14:41:00,9122,"Great video, thanks for that.  I was wincing wondering if they were all going to fall through trying to get it out.  The ice still didn't look too thick.  Joey"
25107,pigeonfisher,2007-01-22 14:44:00,696,how thick was the ice now?
25114,out2llunge,2007-01-22 14:57:00,13,"Only about 4"" at my place."
25298,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-22 23:28:00,4399,I hope he gets a nice fat bill for the recovery for being so stupid!
25306,fishindevil,2007-01-22 23:37:00,6254,well i always wondered how they did that....thanks for the video    cheers
25313,GNODDY,2007-01-22 23:54:00,163,You know what is really funny about these guys is that they already fell through and all of them trying to retreive a sled that has sunk and not one of them wearing a float suit that I can see FOOLISH
