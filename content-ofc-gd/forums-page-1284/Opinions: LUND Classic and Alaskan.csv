24124,krawler,2007-01-19 03:55:00,167,"Looking at both models in a tiller.  very similar.  almost the same price.  will order with vinyl only, no carpet.  Any opinions on either of the boats??  both are very appealing to me.  thanks"
24139,irishfield,2007-01-19 04:05:00,26272,The Alaskan has one gauge thicker aluminum on both the freeboard and bottom than the Classic.  Classic has slightly wider beam.  Classic uses fuel tank stored under rear seat...Alaskan is a built in unit.
24154,Greencoachdog,2007-01-19 04:21:00,8163,I don't think you could go wrong with either one. I did see an Alaskan at Nip last year and it was an awesome boat!
24155,Rich,2007-01-19 04:22:00,3927,"A deep, personal friend of mine has an 18' Alaskan and just loves it to death. He really slays those perch in it."
24168,Spiel,2007-01-19 04:31:00,9065,....Not sure if you mean mine GCD?  Anyhow Krawler I bought a new 2006 Lund 1700 Explorer with a 75 / 4 stroke tiller last spring. It's an incredible stable ride.     I also went all vinyl.   
24175,Greencoachdog,2007-01-19 05:24:00,8163,"  Nope, wasn't talkin' about yours Spiel, but yours is awesome as well. I think it was one of the guys from the Religous Musky fishing group that was there earlier in the week that owned it. It was set up with all the bells and whistles (yeah, it was a console  )"
24351,tinbanger,2007-01-19 23:16:00,1028,Not a Tiller but we picked up the 1775 Classic SS ( Side console) last year. Very happy with it . Only complaints is stiching in drivers seat is starting to rip at the seam. Speedo hasn't worked since day one and the down trim on the throttle stopped working the week before it went to storage Hopefully all repaired and fast she's asleep till spring  Smooth stable and dry ride and the 90 hp merc is a perfect match . Tiller definetly a better fishing set up but we also ski and tube and the windsreen is nice in November  Cosidering we upgraded from a 197? springbok it is quite the improvement  Tinbanger
24365,woodro,2007-01-19 23:51:00,168,"they are both nice boats, vinyl is deffinately the way to go as weel. Much easier to maintain, and keep keep. Quick spray with a pressure washer and your done. the only suggestion that i have is spend the extra money and put the max rated engine on it, you will not be disappointed."
24642,fishindevil,2007-01-20 23:43:00,6254,"hey krawler,i just bought a new 1625 classic tiller in the fall,i looked at the alaskan and i just found the classic a nice looking and more comfortable boat,it was a toss up and i went with the classic either way you cant go wrong....i love my LUND.... good luck    cheers.oh ya also i got a $ 300.00 gift certificate as well and bought a lund insulated rain suite you can spend it on all sorts of clothes and lund gear...its awsome"
