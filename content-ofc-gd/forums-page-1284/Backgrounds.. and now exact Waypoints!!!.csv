Alright, a show on Simcoe Smallies, awesome.  Late fall, just how we love to fish'em.  I could see from the shorelines that they were in a lesser known, or should I say, fished area that time of year.  One that I fish a dozen or so times in the late fall.  Then my jaw dropped.  I couldn't believe it, they listed the exact waypoints on the show and named the location.  There are no secret spots - I get that.  Now more then ever.  Next there will be a DVD with all the seasons ""waypoints"" included.  Anything for a $.  Backgrounds on the internet are so passe'."
