We went to BPS and this was the only thing she wanted to buy....a great stuffed fish!  I took this picture of her holding her ""catch""...dont worry...we had a chat about the vertical hold thing already....   The fish now must sleep with her in her bed.  I think we've created a fishing monster!!!  She was watching a fishing show the other day and kept saying ""I better not watch anymore, cause the more I see, the more I want to go fishing!!!! I WANNA GO FISHING!!!!""  She cant wait til spring....and quite frankly, neither can I!    "
