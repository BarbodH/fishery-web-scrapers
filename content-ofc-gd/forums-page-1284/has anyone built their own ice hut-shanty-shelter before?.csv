24780,joonmoon,2007-01-21 05:56:00,528,No but I assemble this one in about 30 seconds.....everytime I go out. 
24784,Carp,2007-01-21 06:56:00,1488,"I'm working on it.  Bought a permanent 8x8 ft. (plywood sides and roof) Roof needs re-design. Aspenite (wafer board) for a floor, but that has to go. Too thin and weak. I want to make it come apart in panels to facilitate storage and transportation.  I'll post a pic if I ever get it ready for this winter.   Good luck with the project."

25030,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-22 06:39:00,1351,"oh, great, thanks for the posts. and dan, i'll pm you my email. thanks a bunch. the only problem i have is transporting a home made hut. we have a caravan and a toyota matrix.. not sure if it can fit? the weight of it wont worry me too much as it will be on a sled and im sure i can carry 100 lb myself. otherwise, worse comes to worse, i'll buy one of them lightweight collapsible ones! any recommendations, looking for 2 persons one. =)"
