25001,bucktail,2007-01-22 03:46:00,1857,The Colts/Patriots game did not dissapoint! What a game! Can't wait to see the Superbowl this year.
25006,bow slayer,2007-01-22 04:01:00,1074,"that game was the superbowl,"
25007,JEREMY,2007-01-22 04:02:00,300,I agree the super bowl would have been better if the saints made it.Hopefully manning will win his ring that he has been waitiing for.GO COLTS GO
25009,xrap,2007-01-22 04:06:00,683,What a game it was. I thought Brady was gonna pull of that last mintue miracle again  What a superbowl it's going to be the number one offense vs number 1 defense
25013,Carp,2007-01-22 04:24:00,1488,"I haven't watched a single game this season. Not really a huge american football fan. I'd rather watch the CFL. About the most I'll do is see some NFL highlites because I'm watching a sports program or the news.  It would be nice if both teams in the championship could win, but we know that won't happen. I say "" GO COLTS ! """
25068,nelly,2007-01-22 13:25:00,256,That game was something else. Colts were 18 points behind and WON.
25072,blaque,2007-01-22 13:33:00,2419,"Great, now we'll get to see Manning in about 12 MORE commercials (sarcasm).......that guy LOVES to see himself on TV. C'mon Canada........back Da Bears!!! If for no other reason than, they are  closer to you than Indy!! LOL!"
25092,OhioFisherman,2007-01-22 14:13:00,6623," LOL commercials mean money! he might just like it! Watch part of New Orleans v Chicago, most of New England v Indy. No favorites and the first games I really watched this year, be nice to see Manning win the Super Bowl."
25145,dustink,2007-01-22 15:55:00,526,"Manning does commericals because he has a great sense of humor and can laugh at himself....love the phone commerical with wig / 'stashe, and the credit card commercial where the kid takes a steam of water in the face, and he says ""You're OK Joey....rub some dirt on it!""  Great game, and I think Manning will have a lot more fans now that he's proven he can win in a big spot.  Go Colts!!  dk"
25148,aniceguy,2007-01-22 15:59:00,1094,"da bears......nothing else to say, other then bring back the fridge and the greatest running back of all time......"
25175,Peter Panfish,2007-01-22 17:03:00,46," I dunno if I'm just a horrible football watcher, but I was sitting there, and that guy Brady whipped it too looked wide open to me, and I'm thinking NOOOOOO he will pull it off, because he was completely in the clear, and then all of a sudden the guy on the colts just teleported right in front of him and sniped it. It was so awesome. I hope bears win the bowl though."
25179,blaque,2007-01-22 17:25:00,2419,"  Sorry Dust, With each commercial i think i can actually see his head growing in diameter. lol.........Sorry, but all Im sayin.......is play the sport. I cant stand when athletes think their actors. Damn OJ Simpson for  starting all this!! lol"
25182,dustink,2007-01-22 17:36:00,526,"See, but when I see them, I don't think he sees himself as an actor...that's what makes the commercials so funny.  LOL...let's hope Manning doesn't end up like OJ!!"
25200,GbayGiant,2007-01-22 18:37:00,1780," Sure it's a Canadian ran league but the majority of the players are still Americans. I would rather have a NFL team in Toronto.  But wow what a game, it's ironic Superbowl will be top offense vs. top defense, it will be fun to see what happens."
