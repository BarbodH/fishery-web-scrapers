24388,bigfish1965,2007-01-20 02:12:00,3382,"There's two big threats floating around the net today. The first one is a remake of the 2005 Postcards1001 virus email. It slips by your anti-virus because the email contains the link to the .exe file rather than contain the file itself. Never click on a link that ends in '.exe' . Never. Ever. The next is Storm Worm so called because it is an email warning you of an approaching and impending storm. This waltzed right across Europe in two days. This virus will turn your PC into part of a botnet system. You'll be sending out thousands of spam emails in no time. This also contains an executable (.exe) file. IF you get these emails, just delete them.  It's winter and I guess the script kiddies are bored. Be careful."
