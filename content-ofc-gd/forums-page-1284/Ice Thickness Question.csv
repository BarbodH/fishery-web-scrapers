24921,xrap,2007-01-21 23:15:00,683,This will be my first time trying ice fishing and and not really to sure how the the ice has to be for it to be acutally safe. So what is the minimal ice thickness safety for you?
24922,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-21 23:27:00,1351,4inch for walking..good black ice
24924,Rich,2007-01-21 23:30:00,3927,I'm good to go on 3 inches.. I've gone through 3 times in my life so the fear of it has been evicted. lol
24926,xrap,2007-01-21 23:39:00,683,"  I think I'll stay off 3"" then"
24927,dwc67,2007-01-21 23:48:00,140,"4 inches for me  if it's your first time when it's cold out the ice is very noisy because it's making ice.when your new to it, it's a bit hard on the nerves when a crack goes between your legs even if it is safe"
24928,Zib,2007-01-21 23:49:00,369,For me I need 4 inches of solid ice and below freezing temps the whole week before I will venture out. Just because it's 4 inches under your feet doesn't mean it's 4 inches 10 yards away. I was fishing on 8 inches some years back when I had to chase the lid for my minnow bucket that had blown away. Within about 25 feet away from my hole the ice started to break up under my feet. I was fishing over 40 feet of water so I had to crawl back to my gear then moved to a safer area.

24943,Clampet,2007-01-22 00:35:00,1947,Me and 2 of my friends walked on 2.5 inches of blue ice over 20 feet of river water with a mild current this week-end.
24944,dwc67,2007-01-22 00:37:00,140, with 50lbs of gear each?
24982,Clampet,2007-01-22 02:42:00,1947," I pulled a small sled. My friends went back today, and caught 3 more Walleye around the same size, 14-15 inches."
25008,boatman,2007-01-22 04:04:00,350,"4"" is safe for foot travel. When you punch a hole in the ice you weaken its structure so you need to factor that in. That's why you shouldn't fish on less than 4"". Not that you can't do it. Its just not safe."
