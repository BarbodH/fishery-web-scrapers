24670,Garyv,2007-01-21 00:43:00,547,I live about 45 Km from an Esso  & Suncor refinery.  So why are we paying 81.9 at the local esso station and 79.9 at the station on the Kettle Point reserve when as of today these were the lowest prices and areas recorded.  Guess it's because we live to close to the refinery!  67.9  Walmart   Dryden Sat 1:48 AM Hiway 17   67.9  Husky   Dryden Sat 1:48 AM  Hyw 17   71.6  Pioneer   Gananoque Sat 1:58 PM   71.9 Petro Canada   Brockville Sat 2:01 PM  72.0  Ultramar   Brockville Sat 11:32 AM
24675,fishdawg,2007-01-21 00:47:00,912,its supposed to not make sense  - wouldnt be right if it did would it?
24695,bigbuck,2007-01-21 01:12:00,2449,"Jeez, in the summer they stick it to ya in Dryden. When passing through last summer it was about 10 cents more than Toronto. In the winter, it's about the same. Go figure."
24750,kemper,2007-01-21 03:34:00,2232,Just filled up at 72 in Oshawa.
24753,charlied,2007-01-21 03:49:00,584,heard last night it was 67 or 69 in whitby......still 81 here in the falls!...when do we get our gas savings.....?
24769,ccmtcanada,2007-01-21 04:38:00,7971,All I know is that I paid $1.33 in TO a few years ago...post 9-11.  Anything under a buck is a bargoon for me....  BTW...it's around 75 cents right now.
24809,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-21 13:52:00,2585,was half on the bag last night and when the wife was driving me home i thought i saw a gas station that said 72.0 i woke up and thought it was a dream until i read this post!  Its a throw back to the early 90's lol  Cheers!
24812,danc,2007-01-21 14:02:00,4677,There's been a gas price war raging on and off in Dryden for a few years now. I paid under 50 cents per litre while driving through there about 3 years ago. I think it all started when Walmart opened their gas bar there.
24813,tjsa,2007-01-21 14:03:00,1578," Would that be Dryden(only know of one in ontario) in Northwestern Ontario????????????  If so, this is just too crazy, cause their gas has to go through us to get there, and we are still paying 96.4 a litre inThunder Bay."
24818,lew,2007-01-21 14:12:00,12767,"2 weeks ago I filled up in Toronto for 81¢ then drove 75 miles to Peterboro and the price had jumped to 89 ¢  Makes you wonder how they figure the pricing , doesn't it ??"
24863,Eddyk,2007-01-21 17:14:00,195,Yesterday I took a drive to Algonquin Park to look around. The gas was around 77 cents in Maynooth but the last gas station in Whitney before you enter the park was 93 cents. Talk about price gouging.
24903,carll2,2007-01-21 21:12:00,443,85 cents here in montreal
24919,mattyk,2007-01-21 23:13:00,2110,Its $1.8 a gallon in Kentucky.
24965,holdfast,2007-01-22 01:57:00,1813,"83.9 in North Battleford Sk.   This price has not moved since Sep even though the price of a barrel has been bouncing.  Well at least I dont have to deal with the IDIOTIC price jumping and bouncing.  There is absolutly no reason for the incredible price differnces in Ont.  Wow, seen up to 10cents difference between Wasaga Beach and Collingwood"
