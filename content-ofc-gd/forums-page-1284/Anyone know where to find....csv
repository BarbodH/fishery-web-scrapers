I went to Canadian tire the other day and they told me thy only had 12v or super expensive ones - neither of which is what I want and need.  Wal-mart had a few in their camping section, but prices were not as good as I expected.  any ideas? It does not need to be high power, and I would prefer if it was small (its for attaching to a powder coat system I will be using for my lures)"
