24727,Carp,2007-01-21 02:48:00,1488,"I won't be there, but have a great trip and bring us back some pics to add to your report.  "
24820,Terry,2007-01-21 14:13:00,14456,hey Ted the date I booked for Nip has come and gone and there was no ice........I hope to get there next year
24823,tschirk,2007-01-21 14:31:00,261,"Terry: So sorry to hear of your missed trip...we where real concerned when we where up north new years day - morning and I was sitting on a cottage deck overlooking open water on the lake, coffee in hand wearing golf shirt & shorts! The sun had warmed the deck to +13c! Unbelievable...  Rob says ice is getting good now."
24940,Jer,2007-01-22 00:30:00,1426,"We just got back from Promised Land Camp.  Good news is the ice is nice and solid, 8""-10"" where our hut was...  ...bad news is we couldn't catch many fish, a few perch and a couple of herring was all we could manage. Still had a blast though...Frank & Claire run a 1st Class operation."
24983,Clampet,2007-01-22 02:44:00,1947,I'll probably be out at the French River around Campbells Bay by next week-end or so.
24988,fishdawg,2007-01-22 03:01:00,912,Hope you have a good time Ted - like Terry said - we gambled & booked for the 1st weekend & the house won
