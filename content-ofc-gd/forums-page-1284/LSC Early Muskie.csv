24836,Shaky,2007-01-21 15:17:00,25,I'm planning a trip to LSC.  I plan to be there from around the 11th of June to the 15th.  Any tournaments the weekend prior?  I have fished LSC before but in July and Aug.  I was there the first week in July last year and I was told the fishing was bad in June is that the norm?
24871,Handlebarz,2007-01-21 18:05:00,3790,We will be having our Chapter opener the first weekend in June for Belle River. Last year was a weired year with the VHS die off I guess we will have to wait and see how things are this year no one knows what to expect until we can fish again. Check back at the first week of June we will know better by then.
