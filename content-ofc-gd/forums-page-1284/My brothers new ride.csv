24829,Tom McCutcheon,2007-01-21 14:55:00,627,My brother (Blues) just got a new Lund Mister Pike 18 with 135 Merc Opti on the back. That will look real nice parked at my dock this summer. LOOK OUT MUSKY. He takes delivery in April. Now he has to sell his old boat 16 ft. Smokercraft Resorter. Thanks for 2ft itis.
24842,lew,2007-01-21 16:00:00,12767,"Congrats to Blues, that's a sweet boat and will for sure look good at your dock.  I actually met your Bro at the Chemong causeway boat ramp a few months back."
24860,Blake,2007-01-21 17:02:00,418,He will love the Mr. Pike.  I have the SS angler which is very similar to it and its a great ride and the best boat I have fished out of for all around fishability.
24891,mattyk,2007-01-21 20:27:00,2110,Sounds like a sweet ride.  Thats what i want to get one day.
24907,fishindevil,2007-01-21 21:33:00,6254,"cheers for you blues,i was talking to him yesterday at JB'S fishing depot, and he was telling me about his new purchase,how can you not fall in love with a brand new LUND, way to go bud    congrats"
24960,Mike,2007-01-22 01:26:00,1,"Thanks everyone. As you can see I'm no longer ""blues"", 'cuz I gotta Lund. Been saying for a couple of years now, ""Gotta get a bigger boat"", ever since getting into muskie fishing about 3 years ago. But man, are there ever a lot of great boats out there to choose from. Nice chatting with you at JB's yesterday fishindevil, and I'll try and post more often. And Lew, it was my brother Tom, (who started this post) who you talked to at the causeway. We've met and talked but it was almost 2 years ago at the Odyssy. Looking forward to it again this year. Anyway I'll try and help out when I can and post reports when I get out. It's going to be a long 2 1/2 months 'til I pick up my boat.  Mike (formerly blues)"
24963,Carp,2007-01-22 01:43:00,1488,Welcome (welcome back ?) to our OFC family Mike. Congrats on the new rig. Sounds like a very nice boat and I'm sure it'll give you many years of adventures.
25081,bigbuck,2007-01-22 13:52:00,2449,Nice shiny new ride. I hope you make it nice and dirty with tons of musky slime. Use it in good health.
