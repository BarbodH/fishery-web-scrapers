25002,sleded,2007-01-22 03:53:00,96,well i went to check out a pond i know of and there was people playin hockey so i was like right on its ice fishing time!! so i went home loaded up the gear and headed to the pond around 12. Asked one of the guys that was playin hockey how thick the ice was he yells over 6 inches rightttttttttttttttt ha ha ha. more like 2 and a half   . so i ended up setting my poles up watchin a hockey game. One other local guy joined me and asked me if he could use my auger so i walked over drilled some holes got him started said it was his first time out ice fishing. Well after i set him up i looked over at my rods and the panfish popper is right over and ready to go in lol!! sett the hook and a nice slab came up through the ice!! i didint have the camera but it was over 13 inches easy put her back to swim anther day. I had a blast out there today cant wait to do it again!
