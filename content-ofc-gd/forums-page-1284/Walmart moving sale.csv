24416,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-20 03:31:00,1351,well.. the walmart at eglinton and warden appears to be moving so they had a sale! most of the stuff is already gone but i managed to pick up a polar therm tip-up for $10 and some ice fishing baits for a buck. anyone else dropped by?
24418,Carp,2007-01-20 03:38:00,1488,"I'm in Mr. and Mrs. Sauga, so a bit too far of a drive to check for deals which may be long gone by the time I get there.  Thanks for the info though. I'm sure it will be useful to someone else."
24419,Garyv,2007-01-20 03:39:00,547,The one in Sarnia is almost moved out now.  Hardly any good deals left as of yesterday but previously there were some GREAT deals.  New super centre opens Jan 24th the day after Princess Auto's grand opening on the 23rd.   I think I'm going to be spending some $$$
24431,Nanook,2007-01-20 04:58:00,565,That reminds me;  I wonder if Irishfield got his refund on his rearview Camera? Are you around Wayne?
24485,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-20 15:13:00,2585,Walmart is a customer of mine and I was in that old wardon store on Thursday.  I picked up some berkly gulp that they had in the back room that was ready to be cleared out.  Apparently the new store will have a kick --- fishing section in the spring. The Vaughan and brampton stores also had some fishing stuff on clearance last week to.  Cheers!
24488,nofrills,2007-01-20 15:16:00,89,"It will be very interesting to see what kind of impact Wal Mart leaving the plaza will have on the surrounding businesses. Also interesting to see what moves in. Lots of rumors flying around the area, and what I hear, it isn't what people are expecting. But then again, just rumors. Only time will tell."
24561,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-20 19:39:00,2585,zellers stores tend to take over empty walmarts.  is there a zellers in the area?
24576,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-20 20:08:00,1351,"i heard that its going to be a superstore? i dont recall a zeller being around there, closest one is at vp and eglinton i think."
24669,nofrills,2007-01-21 00:43:00,89,"There is a Zellers at Pharmacy and Eglinton...no more than a 10 minute walk. Again, lots of rumors...Sams Club, but I dont think they have enough square footage, OR high enough ceilings, someone across the lot wants to subdivide it...who knows. Time will tell."
24696,bigbuck,2007-01-21 01:15:00,2449,"nofrills, you work at Dickie's no frills store @ Golden Mile??  The Walmart superstore will probably hurt the local businesses for the first month or so until people have been there and go back to their normal place to shop."
24785,nofrills,2007-01-21 11:35:00,89," I did 12 and a half years at a different location before I realized that they don't care about their employee's happiness or future, so I got out while the getting was good."
24815,Benthook,2007-01-21 14:06:00,56,We have a second Wallyworld opening in Burlington and I'm thinkin of opening a body shop across the road from it so my potential customers can simply push there vehicles right into my lot from the potential fender benders in the area from the heavier flow of traffic...Like we really need two Walmart's...gimme a break~!  ....Burlington's getting built up like mad lately~!
