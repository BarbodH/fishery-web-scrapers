24843,solopaddler,2007-01-21 16:03:00,8605,"My buddies and I did a week long fly in trip out of Armstrong last summer. I had forgotten about these pic's as they were saved, not in my computer, but in my hotmail account. Just stumbled across them yesterday, so in keeping with some of my recent posts, here's some more pic's from the archives!  Flying in    Our accomodations for the week    Sunset    Johnny with an average sized pike and walleye. No trophies were caught on this trip, but the numbers of walleye were astonishing...     We were actually able to wade the beach in front of our cabin and catch fish! Here's Dave getting a little ambitious!    Me landing a walleye...    Enroute to our shorelunch site on the adjacent portage lake...      Wading for walleye    Johnny at the helm in the portage lake    One to many wobbly pops    The obligatory stringer shot (these were some of our take home fish)       It was a perfect trip: great weather, tons of fish, and a lot of laughs"

24846,Cast-Away,2007-01-21 16:20:00,790,"What a great report Solo! Wading for Walleye, how awesome is that?!!"
24849,solopaddler,2007-01-21 16:28:00,8605,"Trophy Fish Outposts, Kenozha Lake. The reason we chose this particular outfitter was that unlike most of the outpost camps in the north these ones are relatively new. The land is leased from the natives up there. Most camps are on crown land use permits and the government isn't issueing any new ones. When I was soloing up there I did a side trip into Keezik Lake (another one of their outpost lakes) close to Kenozha. The fishing was incredible so I filed away the info..."

24916,Gerritt,2007-01-21 22:57:00,6129,WOW!!! thanks for the report! Looks awesome!!! how far North is this place? just outta curiosity  Gerritt.
24920,solopaddler,2007-01-21 23:15:00,8605,"Thanks guys.....Gerritt, Armstrong is about an 18 hour drive from where I live in S. Ontario. It's a whistle stop on the CNR tracks about 2 hours n/e of Thunder Bay, long haul for sure, but worth it. I've paddled most of the lakes and rivers north of Armstrong, and they're pretty much all teeming with fish."
