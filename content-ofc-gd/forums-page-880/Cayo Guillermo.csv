318023,TJQ,2009-03-16 16:44:00,7806,We've decided on the Iberostar Daiquiri in Cayo Guillermo for our trip this year.  Looking to leave in early April.  Anybody been???  Any fishing tips??

The best part is that you can eat at any of the five hotels that are side by side. No one knows who is who. They say Iberostar is a 4 star but Id say more like 5 and you will see when you check out the others. Good food. Renting a car is a joke. 20 for the day with no license or INS. Be careful. Lots of cows running around....lol. Had a blast both times. Went with my wife and Son the first time. Went back to fish the second time. Bridge fishing can be fantastic. Tarpon,Permit, snook. cubara snapper, jacks as well. I have kept in touch with a few people down there and can set ya up for a night of fishing if you like. Its all free of course...Any more info just PM me....  Have fun. that's the easy part!!"
318084,cityfisher,2009-03-16 18:51:00,959,Im planning on heading to the area either early april or early may... and my bro will be at the Daiquiri late April (snagmasteral)  Supposed to be good for DIY fishing.. If either of us are there when your there well hook up!
318197,Great Lake Steel,2009-03-16 23:56:00,41,I was next door in Nov at the Melia Cayo Guillermo. I took a walk through the Daiquiri... I wasn't as impressed with their grounds... the melia had lots of open shaded areas with hammocks etc. That being said the pier at the Melia might be fixed by now... it's stretches fairly far out and some guys have caught decent baracuda off there. (musky tackle) the pier was damaged in the hurricanes though and it's taking ages to fix.  If you're going to do an excursion I'd recommend against the jeep tour. It's a tourist trap and you'd have just as much fun driving yourself around in a rental.
