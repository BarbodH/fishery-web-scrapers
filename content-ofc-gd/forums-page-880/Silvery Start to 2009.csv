318202,MJL,2009-03-17 00:09:00,2427,"It’s been an awfully long time since I’ve fished in March for anything – The last 4 years I usually had mid-term exams and assignments due at this time of year.  I managed to get out for a few hours today from 9am-12pm.  Scouted out a couple of tribs but they were quite muddy.  I ended up fishing a small trib that I didn’t even know had steelhead in it till a couple of days ago.  It pretty much looked like a drainage ditch with lots and lots of wood about.  In the rush to get out of the house, I forgot my roe, single eggs, soft plastic tubes, flies, jigs, kwikfish and  spinners at home…I only had pink worms with me in my wading jacket.  I tried pink worms for most of my time there but couldn’t get any fish to take.  One angler who was leaving put some uber-stinky roe bags in an empty coffee cup and gave it to me to try.  I stuck a chartreuse coloured roe bag on my hook and my first 2 drifts in I had a few light taps register on the float...3rd drift I got a hookup.  I didn’t really plan out what I was going to do if I got a hookup.  I had a 13+ft rod with lots of wood both in the water and overhead…The fish made me go through all the position found in the Kama Sutra when it decided to go crazy.  I was ducking under branches and guiding the line between some submerged roots.  On top of that I slipped and fell on my ass twice during the fight – Mud and felt soles don’t mix.  I got to test out my new digi-cam on this small silvery buck of around 3-4lbs      Kudos to the angler that hooked me up with bait.  Hopefully that fish was the first of many to come this year."

318276,solopaddler,2009-03-17 01:38:00,8605,"Nice fish buddy, can't believe you forgot everything except pinkies LOL!  That there is a sign of true passion. Only someone who still has the fire burning in his belly would get that pumped up."
318278,silvio,2009-03-17 01:43:00,433,Good job bud.

318331,ehg,2009-03-17 02:48:00,2666,That has to be one of the silveriest chromers i've seen. Good thing you stuck it out for that beauty.
318342,silverstreak,2009-03-17 03:21:00,146,Nice Bullet
318346,camillj,2009-03-17 03:34:00,1988,Great looking piece of chrome ... speaking of drainage ditches... dont laugh ... but a few years (ok more than a few) back we were driving around hwy 26 near thornbury and pulled over to watch the trout swimming up stream in a drainage ditch .... not a trib ... a drainage ditch ... was tooo much ... especially since the season was still closed so they were safe
318488,ccmtcanada,2009-03-17 16:50:00,7971,"Great stuff MJL!  Awesome looking chrome!  I have a feeling that if you didn't even have pinkies, you'd be finding some brush that looked like bugs to put on your hook!"
318574,Steel28,2009-03-17 21:08:00,160,Well done MJL
318671,MJL,2009-03-17 23:59:00,2427, I was fairly close to the point of taking a pair of scissors to the squirrel I saw plastered to the road and making some flies or jigs...It wouldn't be the first time
