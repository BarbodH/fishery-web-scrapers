318609,irishfield,2009-03-17 22:41:00,26272,Reset the rivets... maybe a bit of Sikaflex sealer.. and Bob's your Uncle.  Generally need the transom board(s) replaced by this stage as well....
318853,Garry2Rs,2009-03-18 14:33:00,1425,"The bottoms of many aluminum boats are made from a single sheet of metal cut sort of like an ""M.""  The points of the ""M"" are drawn up and together to form the bow.  A wear strip is riveted on the outside and the keel is riveted onto the bottom. Where this ""M"" closes at the bottom of the ""V"" shape, is where the keel starts.  A wad of putty is used to seal this joint.  On older boats it often starts leaking.  I have repaired this leak by using expanding foam insulation from the hardware store.  You might find a drain hole at the back of the keel, or you might need to drill a small hole to get the nozzle in.  Have a pop rivet or sheet metal screw that fits the hole handy because the foam will expand out of any openings.  There is a Low Expanding type foam that is used for door installations that might work better than the regular stuff I used. If this isn't your problem, Cabela's and BPS sell a sort of resin/plastic stick that you melt with a hand torch and puddle onto any suspicious rivets. Hope this helps..."
