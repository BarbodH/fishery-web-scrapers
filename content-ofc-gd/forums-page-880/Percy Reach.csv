318012,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-16 16:26:00,260,Such a beauty day yesterday went out for a tour.  The waters open.  Northern Pike is open here until March 31  However the boat launch off Boom Rd still has ice two feet thick.  The boat launch across the way at the locks is in very poor shape.  I would not recommend using it until it is repaired.  Forgot to take some pics oh well.  With the warm temperatures it hopefully wont be much longer Here this will cheer ya up...open water yesterday Belleville on BOQ.

Won't be long now  I always wait to put new plugs, cap, rotor, points and condesor in until the spring after a startup and warmup in the driveway  Can't beat old school...easy to fix and pride of workmanship  Just love the first spring WOT feeling"
