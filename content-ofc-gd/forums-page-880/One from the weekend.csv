318628,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-17 23:10:00,260,Nice fish
318631,Leecher,2009-03-17 23:15:00,7832,Great report and pic Vick Nice one!!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
318635,young_one,2009-03-17 23:18:00,620,Fresh steel and rusty metal! Looks like a bike gear. Nice catch!
318647,Paulus,2009-03-17 23:38:00,522,"sweet fish... yikes!     Look out for that Oshawa Luck Charm! Somebody's bike lost a part! lol!  :lol:  p.-  p.s. keep your chinooks for roe, most of them are stocked at least, and it works just as well (caught this one with chinney roe last weekend http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v11/paul...hn/PICT0194.jpg )... steelies get help only from you and me on this side of the border..."
318649,MJL,2009-03-17 23:39:00,2427,WTG Elusive!  That's a fine piece of steel.
319027,elusive,2009-03-18 23:47:00,77,"  It was too early in the morning to keep one, didn't want to walk around with it"
319047,super dave,2009-03-19 00:44:00,323,I agree with you Paulus.  I only use chinny roe as well.  Works just as well.
