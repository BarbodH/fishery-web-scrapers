318893,jwl,2009-03-18 17:07:00,1056,"spray it with cooking spray...if you are doing fish directly on the grill, also works pretty good if you season it up..and spray one sid eof the fish with cooking spray, put that side on the grill, spray the other side before you flip it"
318903,John,2009-03-18 17:25:00,2956," What make is the grill and what are the grids made from? Never put meat, fish, whatever on a cold grill, it WILL stick. A very hot grill and a little olive oil works wonders. You may be able to get a copy of the manual from the makers website."
318917,Gerritt,2009-03-18 18:41:00,6129,ColdH20guy.... All depends on the material your grill is made from... if Cast iron you will need to pretreat the grills...  G

318953,John,2009-03-18 20:19:00,2956,"If they are porcelain coated then no problem just get them good and hot before you start grilling. Brush some olive oil or other vegetable oil on the food before you put it on. Word of advice, don't use a stiff wire brush on porcelain coated grills or before you know it they will be no longer. Suggest you wash them in warm soapy water with a nylon scourer. If they get really bad (bbq sauce etc), use a spray on oven cleaner on them but make sure they are cold before you spray it on."
318955,ColdH20guy,2009-03-18 20:37:00,312,great thanks..off I go!
318957,misfish,2009-03-18 20:45:00,29133,"You can also have a spray bottle on hand with some EVOO.Just spray the grill and yer set to go.  Dont thing everything has to be cooked over the heat.Indirect cooking on the BBQ, is awesome, and much more rewarding."
318976,ColdH20guy,2009-03-18 21:42:00,312,yeah I do some back ribs like that..awesome!
