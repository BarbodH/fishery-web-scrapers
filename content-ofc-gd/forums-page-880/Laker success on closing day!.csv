318475,Fisherpete,2009-03-17 16:33:00,1814,"Well, my laker curse has finally been broken on closing day (March 15th, 2009). Thanks to the advice of a really nice guy named Lawrence who I met on the Simcoe board and then out on the lake, and the use of an ultralight setup with nothing more than a splitshot and minnow on 4lb line, I finally managed to get my first few lakers on closing day. Brought my son Nick - oops I mean Fishernick - out with me and he shared my fun day, although he is more of a perch guy (needs constant action to not get bored out there). The weather was beautiful, the company was good, what more can a guy ask for! Maybe it is the new auger... I haven't been skunked yet since getting it, and have had my best days for both whities and lakers!  GCD - for the tourney, do we measure the fish from nose to the fork or to the tip of the tail? The bigger Laker was 22.5"" nose to tip, 22"" nose to fork. HEY - that 1/2"" might matter in the end LOL!  The pics...      "
318632,Joeytier,2009-03-17 23:17:00,3990,Nice going.  I didn't catch a single laker all season.  Just whities.
318638,Leecher,2009-03-17 23:25:00,7832,Great report and pics Fisherpete  Beautiful lakers!!  Congratulations to both of you Thanks for sharing Leechman
318744,smokin joe,2009-03-18 02:20:00,226,"Nice pics and report Fisherpete thanks so much, glad to see you broke the skunk. Congrats to the both of you"
318820,Bly,2009-03-18 11:50:00,1556,Congrats on breaking the skunk!    Looks like fishernick was having a lot of fun out there    Good job on the team upgrade...go team 1!!
318827,Greencoachdog,2009-03-18 12:15:00,8163,"Great report Pete!!!  We'll measure all of our fish from nose to tail tip Pete, if someone doesn't like it... they can go eat worms!  I've got a couple upgrades I'll post for the team sometime today... GO SLAMMERS!!!   ... isn't it about time to change your signature Pete?"
318871,Fisherpete,2009-03-18 15:11:00,1814,Oh yeah! I didn't even realize it still had last years team on it... I'll do that now.
318874,Cudz,2009-03-18 15:25:00,2652,Hey That smaller fish your son is holding.  That doesn't really look like a laker.  It almost looks like a hybrid of some kind.  Maybe it is just young.
318876,Joey,2009-03-18 15:34:00,9122,"I'm glad you did well Fisherpete.  As you know we did not and were only sitting a few yards from you  Hope the minnows came in handy, cause they did squat for me  Nice fish, glad you son enjoyed himself.  Couldn't have asked for a better day out there.  Joey"
318885,jwl,2009-03-18 16:34:00,1056,nice going on the fish for team 1
318887,Fisherpete,2009-03-18 16:49:00,1814,"There we go... new logo in place.  Cudz - I thought the smaller one looked a little different too,  the markings on the top were really nice - but like you said, maybe just the markings of a young'un..."
318901,jharcnc,2009-03-18 17:22:00,14, Could be a splake?  Nice fish.  Cheers
