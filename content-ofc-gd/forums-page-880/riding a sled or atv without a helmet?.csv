318096,mikeh,2009-03-16 19:54:00,824,I fished Simcoe on Sunday and saw a few people riding atv and sleds (passengers mostly) without helmets. Just curious what the fine is ? Is the driver fined or the passenger with no helmet?
318097,Terry,2009-03-16 19:57:00,14456,"don't know the amount but  if the passenger is under age, the drive gets a fine if the passenger is over 16 the passenger gets the fine  but as we all know the best way to avoid a fine is to          try to out run them......LOL      just kidding"

318104,moose,2009-03-16 20:22:00,266,"hey mike how did u make out at bbp sunday the bikes and sleds were flying by us on saturday didnt notice any helmuts not on, did u see news of lady on snowmobile trails that were closed wrap her sled around a tree and lost her life , with no helmut on and glare ice trails stupid people"
318111,Big Cliff,2009-03-16 20:40:00,6899,"$85.00 and the one that isn't wearing the helmut gets the fine (unless as Terry said, under 16)"
318116,camillj,2009-03-16 20:48:00,1988,I watched one pair of helmetted snowmobile Einsteins get stopped as they dragged a third fellow on a toboggan at about 60 mph across the ice right off Innisfil Beach ... funny (only cause nobody got hurt) but they didnt get a ticket for the helmet infraction ... it seems it was CO who pulled them over and they did get popped for having too many fish ... go figure ...
318117,mikeh,2009-03-16 20:51:00,824,"hey Malcolm, I arrived at BBP around 11:30 and two guys were coming off the ice saying fishing was slow and a buddy of theirs called and said the fish were on fire at Innisfil, so I went to Innisfil instead. I had a whitefish on but it was hooked in the belly so I stuck my rod down and dislodged the hook and it swam away,a few fish were being caught around me but a quite day for me.   I went straight out from Innisfil about 1 1/2 miles out and saw a few atv's and sleds shuttling people in without helmuts, actually saw two guys on an atv and one guy on each side of the driver for a total of 4 on one atv."
318119,mikeh,2009-03-16 21:00:00,824,"Camillj   ,I was fishing about 50 feet away when the CO pulled the guys on the sled over ,at first I thought it was a cop but then they started to pull their fish out I figured it was a CO. When the CO was done with them it looked like the guy was going to get on the little sled again and the CO told him not to and the guy walked in."
318148,moose,2009-03-16 22:12:00,266,wow we were at innisfil two weeks ago when the whitefish were really biting but i didnt get any the guys i was with in two days btween six guys 20 whitefish were released then it just died off for bites far and few between so we moved to bbp
318190,Muskieman,2009-03-16 23:37:00,2472,The fine is about the same price as a 1/2 descent helmet.
318415,Radnine,2009-03-17 13:43:00,1538," Well said, and all anyone needs to know Jim"
318418,Joey,2009-03-17 13:53:00,9122," Aaaaaah the good old days, and who needs a toboggan anyhow, good pair of gloves and a good grip work just fine"
