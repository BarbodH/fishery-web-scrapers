318204,boddah,2009-03-17 00:14:00,61,"I am thinking of going out to new bruinswick or nova scotia this summer and want to try some deepsea fishing.  I  have fished before down south but not up here.  I 've done some searching but didnt come up with much.  Let me know if anyone has fished out that way and their experiences, or if you have any suggestions on a great fishing trip!  Salmon, shark, cod, sturgeon........i'm up for anything out of my ordinary bass, pike type of fishing. thanks for any info mike"

318320,vanillagorilla,2009-03-17 02:34:00,46,"Contact Art at Blue Shark Charters (902) 830-4115.  He is the best!  I have fished in many countries and with many guides and he is simply on a different level.  He has only the best equipment and takes every precaution possible to insure everybodies safety.  I fish with him for a couple of days every year.  The last time I was out I caught a 310 pound Blue that was just over 10 feet long.  It took me just over 2 hours.  You can see it on the ""Getting Hooked"" website in the archived episodes.  That should give you a good idea of what fishing with Art is all about.  Mitch"

318741,Mattones,2009-03-18 02:14:00,587,Iv always wanted to try shark fihsing but I plan to go cage diving this Fall.
318855,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-18 14:36:00,10439,  I remember seeing a show where Lee Wulf was fishing blue fin tuna. The shot I still remember nearly 30 years after seeing the show was aired was a shot from the fly bridge of an umbrella rig in the prop wash and the head of a 1000# tuna came out of no where. The head on it was the size of a volkswagon and it had an eye as big as a dinner plate. Awesome!!!!!!
318916,boddah,2009-03-18 18:39:00,61,"well , i contacted sharks unlimited and they are all booked for the year.  so looks like that ones out"
318984,vanillagorilla,2009-03-18 21:58:00,46,Did you contact Blue Shark Charters?
319050,boddah,2009-03-19 00:54:00,61,"they have not got back to me yet.  If I cant get a charter I might go fly fishing for salmon, sea kayak the bay of fundy , eat lots of lobster and golf on an ocean course instead."
