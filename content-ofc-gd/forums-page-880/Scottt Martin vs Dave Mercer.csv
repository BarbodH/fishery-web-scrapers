Nothing like a loss that keeps hunting you. Scott is a great guy and we have talked about doing another show together I think he wants payback!  Also since the Aligator Gar show aired a few months ago I have been getting a ton of messages asking when it will be back on. Well its back tonight at 8pm on WFN and this weekend on The Score.  Hope to see you all this Sat and Sunday at Bass Pro Shops at 2pm. Make sure to say hi!  Regards,  Dave"
