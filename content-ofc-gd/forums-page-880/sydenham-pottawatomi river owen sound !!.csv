319072,silvio,2009-03-19 02:08:00,433,Hey everyone I am going to go up to my cottage in wasaga beach tomorrow afternoon and was hoping to get out fishing on the sydenham and pottawatomi Friday morning. This will be a new experience for me as I have never fished them before. I have gone over the regs and no the limits of the rivers.  My biggest concern is the water I should concentrate on Iâ€™ve heard of fishing the harbour wall on the sydenham and apparently pottawatomi can be good. anyways any advice/ experiences would be much appreciated. thanks in advance.
