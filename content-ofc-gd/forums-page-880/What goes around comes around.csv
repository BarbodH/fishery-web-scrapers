318693,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-18 00:49:00,4399, Just because a person served overseas does not give them the right to make biggoted racist remarks.
318711,danbouck,2009-03-18 01:14:00,4380, Racist?
318714,skeeter,2009-03-18 01:16:00,1907,well we havent heard from holdfast!!!! maybe the white trash guy took out more then the trash.......... irishfield get out your plane.. your needed for a search and rescue............
318716,Roy,2009-03-18 01:23:00,13728,All's good folks. I'm sure they're both having a beer after a hard day on poop patrol reminiscing about the days when he was holdie's commander in the turd battalion.

318752,irishfield,2009-03-18 02:42:00,26272, Now that there is funny.. I don't care who you are...
318754,Joey,2009-03-18 02:46:00,9122," Actually, it's spelled Bigot!  The definition of Biggot  = Biggot (buy-gut): A bisexual f.a.g. who cannot spell, not to be confused with bigot (big-ut).  *From the Urban Dictionary*"
318762,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-18 03:13:00,4399,You are a funny guy Joe.
318764,Cookslav,2009-03-18 03:41:00,1457,"LOL... A lot of heated responses for a whole lotta nuthing? Seemed like a rather humorous situation to me but whadda I know....  If Holdy read him right the first time, my guess is there's a great story comming  ; If not, I'm sure his response will be ""hat in hand""  Either way I'm wanting the scoop now"
318777,holdfast,2009-03-18 04:22:00,1813,"Ah I just got back from my Tuesday Military duty that is a three hour round  trip Saskatoon.  Just to let you know how it went with Turd Boy, is that he will be doing some more work for the Town under my supervision to pay off his debt to Society for breaking the law once again.  Surprisingly he showed up and on time.  I never let him know who I was, never mentioned about his complaint till later.  Told him who was boss and exactly what he was to do as in his Garbage Detail .  I made sure that he lifted 95 percent of the towns garbage and gave him some scenarios as in how some people will try to take advantage. Lucky we had one resident that had 15 Residents worth of Garbage in which I made a point on the insanity of the situation.  Yup he loaded all 15 Bags under my guise.  When we approached his place I made it a point to say how we had one complainer that lied about his Turd bag, and then I looked at him and said.  IT WAS YOU Wasn't it.  I think I caught him in the headlights.  He tried to say That I busted the Bag on purpose, but that's when I corrected him.  He pretty well of admitted that he tossed a turd bag amongst the sealed tagged bags.  That's as good as admitting that he lied to me.  I found out that supposedly he was in the Army.  When I quized him, he kind of changed his dates of 10 years.  He is a Bull er.  Then he mentioned he went to Military Cook school and bragged that his supervisor told him to go to the beach for a couple of weeks and drink beer as what Turd Boy told me"" Because the Master Corporal told him ""because he knew more about cooking than the Instuctor.  I told Turd Boy is that it sounds Retarded and unbelievable to me.  Now here's where I really respect him here, like some of the OFners want me to.  I asked him what his fine was about.  His Reply was.  Driving without a registration.  Oh Yea, the cop was out of line because Turd Boy was rushing his wife to the hospital due to MS, however the cop would not drive his wife as Turd Boy was prohibited from driving.  Yea a real winner eh, blame the cop.  One of my pet peeves, blaming others.  I foresee that Turd Boy is going to help me to cut and load a bunch of trees for his next job  I like this Idea of working off his fine.  The way they are working it is $10 an hour.  So he has $190 of work to do.  That's about 16 hours more work."
318778,holdfast,2009-03-18 04:25:00,1813, Thanks Al for sticking up for me.
318780,holdfast,2009-03-18 04:37:00,1813," Ok, Can I call you Sweety.  Since you like bringing up Crap that is only intended to disrespect and accuse, why don't you be the Big Man and give me examples of being Racist.  Remember what a racist is. So, when have I oppressed, cause prejudice, or incited violence against, I guess a Different color or Language than myself.  Lets go Mouth Piece, Prove it."
318790,Zebco,2009-03-18 07:06:00,123,"So let me get this straight?  You wannna make life miserable for a guy that got busted rushing his wife to the hospital who has M.S?  Yes sir you are a big bad army man, ppl should look out for you.  You would think with all this experience in the military you would be more mature, or were you picking up garbage for the army as well?  Gotta love them garbage men, they keep the world safe!"
318791,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-18 07:18:00,1183,Excellent Holdfast....I'm impressed with how you handled the day with your new friend 'Turd Boy' lol    I'm sure he'll keep you entertained with many a story.
318792,Zebco,2009-03-18 07:33:00,123,"I think all of you are a bunch of class acts or do you read the story?  This ex-army garbage man is picking on a poor guy and his wife that is handicap.  God forbid someone catch a Bass outta season, but you all praise this guy like he is a hero.  I just don't understand you guys rooting him on, must be some family issues from the past that give you people this complex that your crap don't stink.  Take's a pretty big garbage man to pick on the handicap!"
318794,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-18 07:50:00,1183, No question you have been offended....and I believe would find fault no matter how Holdfast would have handled his day.  Let it go.

318801,pikehunter,2009-03-18 10:11:00,1659,"Zeb seems to have some authority issues. I keep going back to the original post from HF and I have yet to see anything racist or prejudiced in his story. He is stating a fact of how this guy lives and giving a comment that is probably held by most. Give it a break Z.  Good on ya HF for getting back at him. Revenge is sweet, you got your just dues and now it is time to let the scumbag work off his debt. If his tale of his charge is indeed true then he may not be so such a bad character. Another 16 hours of working with him and you can decide if he is an OK dude or not. Maybe you'll become good buddies in the end.   And you could as well be just right, if it smells like dogsh_ _, looks like dogsh_ _, tastes like dogsh_ _ then it's dogsh_ _!"
318832,holdfast,2009-03-18 12:36:00,1813," Let me remind you that, he lied to my Boss who thankfully can see past this guy whom I'm sure knows more about him than I do.  Let me also say, that I caught him BSing me more than once and his MS story about his wife, which she clearly has, has no excuse for him driving illegally.  But what kills me is he actually thought that the Cop was out of li8ne for ticketing him and prohibiting him from driving.  In his own words, the least he could of done is drive his wife to the Hospital.   I wasn't there, but I'm assuming the Cop was acting Professional with the public safety in mind.  Am I getting a kick watching this guy work, you betcha, and I'm learning that he has a lot of dead Braincells for a man that is my age.  Don'T give me the Poor little helpless guy act. Ive seen a lot of excuses and Bull crap in my Professional Career.  As a Soldier in a Leadership role, your part Social worker as well as father figure to your guys, otherwise they will not follow you.  They have to respect you if your going to Order them in a Minefield or lay their life on the line. Oh, Loyalty is another huge factor.  Trust me, I don't feel sorry for this Guy.  Yes, I do get a kick out of your comments, I like seeing the opposite side of things which you clearly are.  Kind of wonder what kind of person you are, Weak, Mis Guided?, easily offended, Maybe you have issues yourself that pains you.  Keep me Guessing.  Clearly your not military material, but your not alone.  Just remember every country has a Military, if it ain't theirs, Its SOMEONE ELSES."
318835,RuNnYoOzE,2009-03-18 12:51:00,270,well past time this issue was dropped and lets get back to fishing!  I know it's hard to forgive and forget but seriously this thread  is serving nothing for anyone. Please I am not attacking anyone just let it go people I sometimes wonder why it's easier to cause problems and hate on someone and this guy for real has been humbled by doing garbage work for you ...see this is a lesson dont  poke a snake the snake just might come back and bite yea on the tush! poetic justice and humbling...yes yes the gentleman  question has be humbled let it rest at that and HAPPY season guys lets hear those fish stories!
318838,Spiel,2009-03-18 12:58:00,9065,"  Agreed! And remember if you have respect for someone nor matter how little you don't refer to 'em ""Turd Boy""."

318373,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-17 12:01:00,1183,"I sure did get a chuckle from this.  Every now and then something/someone comes along and shakes up our world.  He hasn't made a good 'first impression' on ya, but that doesn't mean he has no worth.  Your town sounds very small and I would think pretty 'tight'...he just may need a little guidance.  Sometimes the lowly can be the most loyal.  I too am looking forward to hearing how your day goes."
318380,holdfast,2009-03-17 12:31:00,1813, Chris I also kind of enjoy your comments and input.  It makes for an interesting forum at times.

318410,Radnine,2009-03-17 13:37:00,1538,What goes around comes around indeed. You have a terrific opportunity to show this fellow what your day is like and what goes into a decision to leave a torn bag of poop in someones driveway. Perhaps when he sees how hard you work and what a sweetheart you are he will not be so quick to file a complaint (the next time you leave a bag of excrement in his driveway). Have a good one! Jim

Im indifferent as far as taking a side here and dont have much of a response or suggestion, lets just say its entertaining and leave it at that lol. Actually, let me add, i wouldnt want to be this guy that has to spend a day under you LOL. I can see this guy on the side of the road dropping and giving you 20"

318447,Billy Bob,2009-03-17 15:30:00,5865,"Holdfast, I'm pretty sure you have this guy pegged. But like some others have said I would take the high road, however still making him do more than his fair share of work. He should do at least what you do in a normal work day by yourself.  In four sight the town is putting themselves in a dangerous position. A guy like this could complain of a back injury either before the end of the work day or even the next day.  Anxiously waiting to hear about your day with him.  Bob"

Holdfast, you've made a big assumption here, and I'm not talking about whether this guy is a low life, I'm talking about him showing up for work. I'll bet he develops a sore back overnight. Sounds to me like your town knows how to rid of those that prefer to munch on tax dollars. wish our little town would put the chronic abusers to work. Had a housefull in a rental property across from my house for 2 years. In that time they destroyed the house (the owner was in a nursing home), and it was finally condemned. When they did the inspection there was 12"" of dog crap in the basement. No kidding. Wonder where they moved too? Maybe it's your man? Is his name Axel?"

318561,POLLIWOGG,2009-03-17 20:22:00,835,By trash he means its obvious he hasn't ripped anybody off for large sums of cash.  Could you picture Conrad  doing community service with Holdfast.  Holdfast should be back from Calgary soon.
318606,HTHM,2009-03-17 22:37:00,4082,"Guys, I have spent two days with Holdfast in close quarters and feel that he is a good guy. However, he does not take any guff, and deservedly so, as he has taken more guff than most of us have had. Don't forget he has served overseas in some pretty nasty situations, and it is only by grace that he hasn't taken the somber trip from Trenton to Toronto."

318630,ch312,2009-03-17 23:13:00,1590,"you're questioning whether you should act like an immature idiot or a man? you're a grown adult?  you were at work when this happened and he did the right thing by contacting someone above you to deal with your tossing of the crap. while at work you need to act professional all the time. your job is to pickup garbage, not throw it back. you cant handle a little bit of dog turd in the back of your truck?"
318654,Zebco,2009-03-17 23:46:00,123,Glad some ppl see it the way I do.  Was starting to think I read his post wrong or something.   Hope ya did the right thing today!
318677,pikehunter,2009-03-18 00:18:00,1659,"Yep what goes around does indeed come around. Glad to see this low life has to do some community work to pay his debt to society.  Do what you feel is best, but remember that he accused you once of something and will do it again if given the chance. But make sure he gets his dues in a discreet manner and can't pin anything against you. Sneaky revenge is so good."
318208,holdfast,2009-03-17 00:19:00,1813,"So I work for a small resort Town 40 Kms from the city.  They call me the Townman, which I guess you can say is the Maintenance man.  I am the Public Works that wears many caps.  I look after the Fire Hall, on call during the day, maintain the roads, buildings and utilities, I'm even the Dog Catcher.  Part of my job is also garbage pickup on Tuesdays. Bags are tied and tagged and I throw them in the PU truck and haul it to the dump.  Its a good easy workout.  So far Ive had no complaints except one last Tuesday.  These new people moved in renting an old house, with their old Suburban with a wooden rear window and some old school bus parked in the back yard and several Dogs.  They are dirty looking and obviously on social assistance.  Ill say it, TRASH.  Well I get to their place and low and behold they got about a dozen Garbage bags.  I pick them up and out drops a small bag with Turd that broke opened.  They tried to pull one over.  Anyways I didnt want it in my truck or on the curb so I tossed back in their driveway.  They call the town and complains that I purposely busted the bag.  Anyways I call him up and he tells me that he seen me and hangs up on me.  Yea I guess I shouldn't of gotten his number.  I find out that he has to do community work to pay off fines and guess what.  HE IS WORKING FOR ME TOMORROW TO PICK UP GARBAGE.  Luv how things work out.  I am going to sit in the Truck and watch him pick up every stinking Garbage Bag.  My question is.  When I first meet him in the Shop I want to read him a Riot act.  My pet Peeves.  Stealing , Lying, Complaining, I won't or I can't.  I will end it covering my tush by stating "" I'm not saying that you do any of this""  Should I do this as payback is great feeling or just forget it. NO, I dont feel sorry for him,  I'm still not going to lift a finger though.  Any advice."

318231,Joeytier,2009-03-17 00:53:00,3990,"I would certainly take the safe way out and be courteous.  In the long run, I couldn't see the other way working out very well for anybody."

As far as I see it you didn't do your job right and got mad this ""white trash, inferior"" guy called and complained.  Shame on him it is his fault!  If he was as much White trash as you say he is he would of left his dog crap in the yard for you to step in!

318244,OhioFisherman,2009-03-17 01:05:00,6623,Is his septic system working? Or city sewage? Maybe there is a disabled person in the house that uses a disability potty chair? A plastic bag in them reduces clean up? If they are on social assistance that might be a reason?

Maybe its me but I think I would talk to the man himself. 2, He lied  Zebco I luv it when you talk like that.  It gives me a rod on.  By the way, no excuses for not having a job.  Apparently he was asked if there was anything wrong with him to pickup Garbage.  Town needs to cover their tush.  Wow, never knew I had it so good picking up trash.  You see, I dont care as long as Im working.  As far as the OFC thing, I joined when I was living in Ontario.  Has nothing to do with where Im living now, just ask the other out of Province and Country OFNers.  Like I said you give me a Rod on Baby.  Oh look, Im uneducated, I made a spelling mistake."
