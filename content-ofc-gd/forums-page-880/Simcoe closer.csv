By the time we have lines sets up it was just getting light.  I was feeling really good about today.  What was really nice about today was that since most of the huts were gone, there was hundreds of 8 and 10"" auger holes everywhere, making it easy to fish when you've got a hand auger.  Well, we avoided the skunk, but it wasn't easy.  We moved at least a dozen times fishing anywhere between 78-92 feet.  The only 3 hits of the day came out of a set of holes in 85 FOW.  One was landed, one got off after about 3 seconds, and well, I'll let the video explain the last one.  After close to six hours of really slow whitie fishing, we decided to head into the perch grounds to make sure we finished the day on a high note.  In about 45 minutes, we managed to ice maybe 15-16 perch.  Nothing too big, but fun regardless.  Words cannot explain how amazing the weather was.  By the end of the day, I had completely stripped my survival suit off, and was down to a sweater and jeans.   A great sunrise shot.   Fishfinder troubles (you get what you pay for).   Ice was in great shape.   A typical perch, caught on a forage minnow and gulp waxie   Pretty bad photo, but the one whitie we managed to ice and KEEP iced. "
