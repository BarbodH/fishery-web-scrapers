317978,fishnsled,2009-03-16 14:40:00,3520,Great report Terry.  I've been looking at getting a set of those ice scratchers for a couple of years and was wondering how well they'd work.  I guess I'll be giving Royal a call and placing an order.
318001,LeXXington,2009-03-16 15:52:00,1928,"Nice going Terry,  Thanks for the Vid, 6 more car's under the ice LOL."
318642,cisco,2009-03-17 23:33:00,597,Nice report terry! Those ice scratchers look like a good idea but a pal was under the understanding they're for liquid cooled machines where the ice chips hit the rads and melt to also lub the sliders. Does anyone know if they are also good for old 2-stroke beaters like some of us chepskates have?
318708,Terry,2009-03-18 01:08:00,14456,"Cisco they will work / help any snowmobile The snowmobile’s track rides on a small piece of plastic called a Hy-fax. It’s this Hy-fax that can melt with friction caused by the moving track. Once the Hy-fax is worn out the track would literally ride on the metal rails causing considerable damage to your machine. Fresh snow rotates inside the track and keeps the Hy-fax cool enough not to melt. When you are riding on a lake, or a hard packed trail there is no loose snow to perform the necessary cooling. Ice scratchers are designed to deploy from both of your snowmobile track rails (rail mount) or from your ski’s (ski mount). Once deployed they spray small chunks of ice or compact snow into your track to keep everything lubricated and operating as designed.  but snow / lubrucation  is less important for snowmobiles with the old boggie wheels"
317319,Terry,2009-03-14 17:47:00,14456,"went out on simcoe to get in the last of the whitefish lake trout action before it closes the fishing was pretty good, iced a few kept one that was bleeding missed a few too and right at the hole for the first hour or so the fishfinder mark fish constantly, then it slowed down but there were fish around  all the fish I caught were close to the bottom, they just wouldn't come up for a lure    I started out in a spot with no one around by the time I left there were 10 people so close I could have peed on them from my hut one van drove by and missed my hut by 3 ft.I yelled and screamed at him and he heard me, he thought I was yelling with excitement because I caught a fish so he stopped and fished...moron .  the last time I was on simcoe with my skidoo I nearly burnt out my sliders and it kept overheating, so I put on ice scratchers man they work well, no more heat     so people was asking about the news report of the vehicle recovery on simcoe, so I recorded it and here it is         guess it's perch and pike fishing now"
317321,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 18:26:00,8163,Great report and vids Terry!  15 hours to salvage that vehicle from the bottom of the lake was cheap I'll bet.
317324,smokin joe,2009-03-14 18:38:00,226,"It's always a circus the last days of the season, glad that idiot didn't run into your holes or hut.  The salvage companies must love this time of year though.  I don't think I would ever drive my truck out on the ice, it's just to much to lose to me.  Not to mention that the walk wouldn't kill me"
317331,misfish,2009-03-14 20:04:00,29133,Thats fox island right? Ice scrathers? Never heard of them.  Glad you enjoyed the ice season bud.  Do you own a noodle rod?
317332,Terry,2009-03-14 20:24:00,14456,I have something like a noodle rod I haven't used it in years.......haven't walked the banks in years
317338,misfish,2009-03-14 20:48:00,29133, The bank cant be that far?
317339,misfish,2009-03-14 20:49:00,29133,
317353,Leecher,2009-03-14 21:41:00,7832,Great report and vids Terry  Good looking whitie.... congratulations Got to love the ice scratchers for doing it's job!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
317376,moose,2009-03-14 22:46:00,266,why people brignt their trucks on the ice is beyond me.
317383,Fisherman,2009-03-14 22:54:00,7201,"It looked like a Wal mart parking lot today around the islands and Innisfil Beach, and the worst were some of the nutbars going about 100, water splooshing up and down in the holes.  Oh well..candidates. "
317396,12footspringbok,2009-03-14 23:28:00,459,Yep... sure was nice out there today   Got into a few whities myself after moving around a few times and finding some active fish.
317398,Joey,2009-03-14 23:31:00,9122,Glad you got into some Terry.  Great videos and report.  I've never heard of the scratchers either.  Joey
317415,Greencoachdog,2009-03-15 00:25:00,8163, That would be because they're too fat and lazy to walk?
317447,Mike the Pike,2009-03-15 01:28:00,3421,Nice last report Terry next time don't smack that whitie so hard.  Should have got one of these Terry  
317463,Sandbag,2009-03-15 01:57:00,533,Terry  Those ice scratchers look like they work awesome.  I've always wondered about them.  Are they easily removable for when there are conditions with lots of snow?  Cheers  Craig
317471,Terry,2009-03-15 02:08:00,14456,"yup real easy, they just flip over the sliders when not in use I had to remove a set of ldler wheels to install them but whatever you do don't back up when they are down"
317521,Terry,2009-03-15 10:14:00,14456,"mike, they are nice but the tracks cost more  then the cost of my skidoo........I would need a second job"
317525,ccmtcanada,2009-03-15 11:23:00,7971,"Great report Terry!  Loved the videos...and the vehicle extraction was pretty cool to see.  If it wasn't for morons, we wouldn't have as many fishing stories...or they wouldn't be as interesting anyways...LOL."
317537,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 12:36:00,8333,  And I love your stories Cliff.
317540,ccmtcanada,2009-03-15 12:56:00,7971, Hey...are you calling me a moron???
317544,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 13:13:00,8333, If the story fits.
317573,Terry,2009-03-15 16:19:00,14456,LOL
317579,moose,2009-03-15 16:49:00,266,hey mike the pike i have an arctic cat 500 4x4 with the tdj track kit it is amazing for the lakes bush plowing everything . atv sleigh and you can go any where
317597,HTHM,2009-03-15 18:34:00,4082,You have a remarkable grasp of the obvious!
317869,ciceri,2009-03-16 03:01:00,535,"Those ice scratchers are great.  Thought you might like to know this about the scratchers. If you make a plate for on top of where the scratchers are bolted on to your running board it will strengthen them. I'm saying this because I am an avid snowmobiler, and I have talked to a few people and have had them show me where the ice scratchers start cracking their running boards from all the force put on them. Then one day a guy showed me how he made some plates for his so that his running boards didn't tear like his buddies.  It kind of looks like you have the same chassis sled as me ZX, and i know those running boards are not strong at all."
