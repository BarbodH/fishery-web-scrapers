We're thinking of renting a cottage for the Ontario Civic Holiday weekend(July 31-aug3)...and are finding most of the cottages have a 1 week minimum....Blue Water will along a 3 night stay.  How's the fishing around that area?  we'll be using their rental boats so can't go out too far.  If not Bluewater/Honey Harbour,  are there any other recommendations?"

But it must not have been that bad because I hold a grudge for forever and a day and they are not in my bad books.  I love that area, the only thing that gets me is the ridiculous (like $15 in $15 out) launch ramp fees in the area.  Charles"
