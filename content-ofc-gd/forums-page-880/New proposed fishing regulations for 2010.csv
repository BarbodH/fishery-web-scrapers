317142,Ron,2009-03-14 01:48:00,1683,"Hey fellow fisherpeople.  I can't tell you everything but some information I can pass on. I have sat on the FMZ 17 Advisory Council for over 2 years. This FMZ covers all of the Trent Severn Waterway from Lock 1 in Trenton up to but not including Lake Simcoe. This also covers Crowe Lake, Round Lake and a few others I neglect to remember.  We have been working with the MNR along with other stake holders on trying to refine the regulations to ensure there is a fishery for future generations. In the same token we have been working on additional ideas for more angling opportunities within FMZ 17.  In the very near future there will be more information available about this advisory council and also some links to information and a survey we strongly suggest anyone who fishes in the Kawarthas to seriously take a look at and ensue your voice is heard.  You have to remember, people seem to fill out surveys if they have complaints more than people who are happy with the existing. We have seen it here more often than not if you want examples. Someone has a beef with customer service you hear about the dissatisfaction first then you hear about all the good a retailer has done for other people afterwards.  I hope we can break that streak. By taking a few minutes of your time to fill out the survey, we can make sure that the majority of people are heard.  I hope to receive the links to this information early next week. and will be sure to post them on this thread. Please check back often.  With out passing off confidential information, I can ask you this.  Do you like Ice Fishing on Lake Scugog? Do you enjoy a nice feed of 2 lb Walleye? Just how long do you feel like cleaning Crappie? Do you like fishing for Muskie late in the season? This has been a lot of work and hope by having members of this forum fill out the survey, the majority gets heard.  Cheers, Ron..."
317146,Tom McCutcheon,2009-03-14 02:03:00,627,Ron; I know that both you and Jerimiah have been working on this diligently for quite some time. When the forms are out I will be adding my voice to the record.  Tom.
317230,lew,2009-03-14 08:42:00,12766,"If your involved in it Ron, it must be something worthwhile.  Thanks for taking the time."
317232,Big Cliff,2009-03-14 09:34:00,6899,I appreciate the heads up and will look forward to seeing and filling out the survey!  Thanks!
317235,musky_man,2009-03-14 12:05:00,159,"Ron,  I am not sure how much input you would have, but ask them to raise the minimum musky size limit to 50 inches in those waters."
317236,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-14 12:21:00,0,Ah common..  ..That'd make it to hard to get some good eats.....
317276,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-14 15:04:00,260,"Look forward to seeing this form and participating in it.  Zone 17 already has ""No Limit"" on Crappie .  Scuttlebutt 'round these parts is Tri-Lakes opening up for a limited winter season for panfish."

317317,jwl,2009-03-14 17:19:00,1056,"good job man,you would be surprizes how much angler input helps the MNR decide some factors attributing to the regs...I am involved in a walleye stocking program every spring with the MNR and as a direct result a couple people I know helped change the regs on ""inland"" pike fishing around here to help lessen the impact on the walleye spawn since pike was open at the same time as walleye closure in the same areas and spawning gorunds...it was then decided that pike would be closed at the same time as walleye for FMZ 16 when the 2008 regs came out"
317420,Beans,2009-03-15 00:44:00,3339,Sounds good Ron...better than some telemarketer calling to fill out a survey at dinner time...
317472,crappieperchhunter,2009-03-15 02:12:00,2582,Lower limits on SLABS....I support. More opportunities through the ice on the Kawartha's for pannies and eyes I support. I never target Ski's so whatever direction that takes is out of my area of expertise.  Your big TEASE sounds so GOOD.  Bring it on!!!
318154,Ron,2009-03-16 22:29:00,1683,"Thanks for all the responses everyone, I was told there should be something sent to me via email on Tuesday."
318164,misfish,2009-03-16 22:59:00,29133," That there is a real shame.  Not bashing your thread Ron,just wish there was more talk about the limits on Simcoe.  GJ BTW"
318200,cisco,2009-03-17 00:04:00,597,"Maybe just a diff Council for Simcoe Brian. Contact MNR and find out about it. MNR was always lacking a social scientist. They were kinda forced to get a PHD fella helping out a while ago, but the survey you speak of Ron could be less biased with proper exprertise behind it.  Recall once where MNR 'expert witnesses' made fools outta themselves at an EA Hearing since they had zero social-science expertise. Genaeral rule of surveys is keep it short, in language respondents can easily understand, no leading questions or comments, secure drop-off method to prevent tampering, ensure the survey-delivery method 'catches' a broad even spectrum of respondents,  and give a token of appreciation for their time filling it out in order to ensure surveys are actually done.  I'd probably hand em out at licence-issuers and give folks a few $ rebate if they take a few minutes to immediately fill out/submit their survey. Also leave a 'comments' section at the back for complaints.  Many ways to skin a cat and the above isn't perfect, but after a few minutes thinking while typing while sipping wine after some deep-fried whitefish, it's easy to see how MNR could improve its surveys.  All the best Ron! Look forward to some perchin' soon!"
318518,Ron,2009-03-17 18:09:00,1683,"The materials have officially been posted to the Environmental Registry – http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/. Search for Registry posting number 010-5587. The consultation period will close on May 19, 2009.    The supporting materials will be posted to the website very soon, but it may take up to 12 hours. A news release is planned for tomorrow. The website is http://www.ontario.ca/zonecouncils - click on FMZ 17. The survey can be accessed via the MNR website, or directly via http://www.FMZ17survey.ca. I’d encourage folks to access some of the information on the main website prior to completing the survey."
318598,Laker272,2009-03-17 22:26:00,45,Did the survey. Thanks for the post.
318867,bbog,2009-03-18 15:04:00,665,Just completed the survey and encourage everyone to do so. The future of our fishery is in your hands.
