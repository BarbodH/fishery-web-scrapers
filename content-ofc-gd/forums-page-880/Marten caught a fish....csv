Saw 8 fish landed...  5 by one guy   .... he was the only one with chartreuse roe bags.  I had a brief hook-up on a streamer, but that was it.  I drove back towards Blyth and stopped at one of my favourite spring steelie creeks to check things out.  Lots freshies' moving around in the dirty water.  I also found this cute little dude hanging around;  not sure if it is a marten or a fisher?  I'm sure someone here will know.  He had a little spat with his wife over the rock bass he caught, but I wasn't camera-ready to catch it.         It was pretty cool to watch it mow down the fish without it knowing I was looking at it....  wish I'd had the better camera."

318659,MJL,2009-03-17 23:52:00,2427,Great pics Nomad.  3yrs ago I actually saw an animal like that steal an angler's steelhead from the garbage bag it was in.  Was totally hilarious to see the guy's expression when he came back from taking a whiz in the bushes.
318726,Sinker,2009-03-18 01:50:00,8692,I'd say that's a mink.
318798,solopaddler,2009-03-18 09:14:00,8605,Cool. Believe it or not I saw one down at the rocks at 50 Point on Sunday.. Fearless little critters.
