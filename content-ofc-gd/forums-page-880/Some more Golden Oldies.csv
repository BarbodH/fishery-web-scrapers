So I better get them done before the ice goes out. So without further ado.......  This is a shot of my dad and uncle on the maiden test voyage of their latest model, the Lake Huron (way back in 1958 or so).   One of dads fishing excursions not sure where.   Not sure where this is but someone here may recognize it.   This may have been my Grandpas car.   Another one suitable for framing.   This poor fellow didn't have a long life. "

319102,Bernie,2009-03-19 02:54:00,3190,Thank you for the links guys. Interesting seeing before and after pics from the same perspective.
319105,kickingfrog,2009-03-19 02:58:00,8333," That doesn't happen often, but it feels nice when it does.  I think they would love that photo, since they have a sketch of that same ""shot"" on their web page background, and a photo in their gallery."
319204,Joey,2009-03-19 14:01:00,9122,Love those old photos Bernie.  I remember we had a boat like the one in the first pic at our grandparents cottage in Minden when I was a kid.  Joey
