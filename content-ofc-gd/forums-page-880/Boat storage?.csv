318338,mikeh,2009-03-17 03:14:00,824,are you looking for storage for a couple of months or longer? do you want to be able to get your boat out of storage everytime you go fishing?

318467,mistaredone,2009-03-17 16:20:00,913,"yeah, I would be picking it up and dropping it off in the summer and storing it in the winter."
318534,mikeh,2009-03-17 19:07:00,824,Have you considered leaving it in a marina in the water and if you want to go to a different lake for the day just put it on the trailer and go. I think the marina's on Rice lake are about $700 for the year.(don't quote me on the price)
