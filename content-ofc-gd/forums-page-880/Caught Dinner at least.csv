318535,Joeytier,2009-03-17 19:09:00,3990,Nice going.  It would've been an amazing day on the ice.

318584,Cudz,2009-03-17 21:33:00,2652,"Yep, close to home indeed.  I had some big minnows on for pike as well and had something hit it but it didn't stick around.  Pulled up and no minnow."
318586,Cudz,2009-03-17 21:36:00,2652,Yes. Having said that I was also drop shotting with micro tubes on the same line as the minnow and it was about 50/50.  When the bite was on early the tubes were great but when it slowed the minnows worked much better. I ended up drillin 20 holes today and fished from 17' to 45'  and caught fish in every hole.
318589,misfish,2009-03-17 21:49:00,29133," You,ll go blind fishing there.YA KNOW THAT RIGHT. l m a o   I would use my,,,,,,,,,,sorry,USE  minnows there too."
