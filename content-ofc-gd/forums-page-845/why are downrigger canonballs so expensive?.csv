343349,PERCHER,2009-05-20 19:51:00,787,You need to look around.Prices vary.You really should have a minimum of a 10lb ball. Any lighter and the ball will  not be almost straight beside the boat. Average price on a 10lb ball is around 20.00-35.00.You mus have been at CTC at 50.00.  Here is what I see for weather and it depends where  you are located on the lake.

343413,ccmtcanada,2009-05-20 23:18:00,7971,"Don't know about the rigger stuff, but here's a much better site for wind conditions.  http://www.sailflow.com/windandwhere.iws?r...mp;timeOffset=0  The wind is measured in knots...so to calculate into kph, multiply knots by 1.852.  10 knots = 18.52 km/h.  The link you pasted does give wave heights...in meters."
