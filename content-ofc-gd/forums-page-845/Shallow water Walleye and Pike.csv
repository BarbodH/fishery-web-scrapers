First started with the floating jig set up, and got into a nice pike(31"") and a walleye immediately....bite was hot tonight.                  The walleye seemed to be biting in close so i decided to try just dragging a jig and minnow around the shallows.....yup...they were in close.        Was greeted by these guys doing a good job as furry lawntractors       "
343955,Roy,2009-05-22 16:06:00,13728,Thanks for the report Simon. Isn't it fun when you can do no wrong out there?

344000,fishnsled,2009-05-22 20:17:00,3520,"If it was my turn to cook dinner we'd all go hungry    I'd have a VERY difficult time pulling myself away from that action.  Big or small, who cares when you are having that much fun.    Thanks for the report."

344089,limeyangler,2009-05-23 01:59:00,5204,"Glad people are enjoying the rports...i love putting them together.    It was one of the hardest things to do my friend...believe. A year ago i would have taken 'the look' after ignoring one or two shouts from the house, but my wife is working her socks off with the baby at the moment...and fair's fair.     LOLOL....BOTH!     If i ever get a gun (and license) i'll be set! only prob is i think i love fishing too much.....only time i don fish is 2 weeks while ice is forming and 2 weeks while ice is melting, but with them crawling all over the yard wont take long to get some sausage meat.     Dale...i dunno what to suggest....i know very little about computers...try  'computer help' in the 'Extra Resources' section on the forum."
344096,Cudz,2009-05-23 02:10:00,2652,I think it is great that you have 30 mins to spare and you walk out your door to the lake and lay smack down on some nice fish.  I love it.
