343351,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-05-20 19:55:00,1362,My starting battery for the pontoon boat has finally died and I need a replacement...I was at Costco this morning and saw one of their Kirkland Starting/Deep Cycle batteries for $94.00...  The battery I had was rated for 625 Cranking Amps and the Costco one is rated for 840 and seems to be longer in size...  Any comments??
343357,bassjnkie,2009-05-20 20:54:00,1101,"I bought a couple last year, believe it or not they are great. A buddy that works for GM told me the Kirkland battery is made by AC Delco."
343519,Tacklebuster,2009-05-21 12:06:00,303,"Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think you need a deep cycle battery as your starter, that would perhaps explain the differences you were mentioning.  I also don't think the alternator in your motor was designed for charging a deep cycle battery.  I would just get a regular marine starting battery, keep it charged when in storage and you should have no problem for the next 10 years."
343607,bigbuck,2009-05-21 17:01:00,2449,"Depends on what you are using it for, I'd stick to a deep cycle for trolling motors and the like and a marine starting battery for the engine. I don't think there is a whole lot of difference b/n batteries. As for AC/Delco manufacturing the Costco batteries, I doubt it, it's probably EXIDE who I believe is one of the bigger manufacturers out there."
343620,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-05-21 17:29:00,1362,Thanks for all the replies lads!!....I decided to pick up a Nautilus Starting Battery 625 Cranking Amps at CTC for $79....it's only used to start the 40HP on the pontoon...
343762,Garnet,2009-05-21 23:17:00,2056,"I worked in the GM battery plant Oshawa and that was sold to Johnson Controls (interstate) 5 years ago.  I will look at them a little closer some day.  We made batteries  for every after market retail outfit cosco sears ctc and I can tell you the were just as good as our delco's. The cheapest piece of junk we made was for $80,000 Lexus and they forced us to make junk.  You do need a deep cycle cranking battery to start outboards car battery will just crapout on you.  Garnet"
