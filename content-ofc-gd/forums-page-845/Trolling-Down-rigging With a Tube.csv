344098,alexmedic,2009-05-23 02:12:00,186,"Heading out on Simcoe tomorrow for some lakers.  Might give it a try..  If I'm successful, I'll let ya'll know!"
344110,Cudz,2009-05-23 02:36:00,2652,let us know.  I have never tried that.  I thought that was what you were thinking.  One thing I might do is put a swivel about 3 or 4 ft up the line just in case that tube starts spinning around and twists your line badly.
