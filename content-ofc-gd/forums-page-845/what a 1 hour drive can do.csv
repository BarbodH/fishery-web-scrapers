I knew I couldn't keep this up for long.  I decided to call up an old friend from high school (that I hadn't seen or fished with for 10 years) and see if he wanted to fish the river in the small town we grew up in. He was game!  Started fishing at 9am and finished around 3pm. So glad I bought myself some waders. The river was beautiful and the weather was perfect. Time was just flying by being that I hadn't seen my buddy for 10 years. We couldn't stop telling stories about growing up together.  At the end of the day we caught:  8 Pickeral 4 Smallies 2 Pike 4 Rock Bass  All catch and release for others to enjoy another time.  Also seen a huge female Gar Pike ( 8 - 9lbs) slowly swimming with what I think were 5 smaller males right under her. Must have been spawning? I thought it was a little late for that?  Man did I ever need a day like that. One hour outside the city makes the world of a difference. Only saw one other fisherman the entire day. To top it off two Bald Eagles were flying overhead. Must have been a good omen.  Laz
