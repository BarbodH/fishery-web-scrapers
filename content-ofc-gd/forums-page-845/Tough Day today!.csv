After landing 4 pike in the 20-26 inch range, we opted to change our gameplan.  We started fishing a little different structure and we found the fish big time.  Now, finding fish, and getting them to bite is an entirely different game.  I had a bunch of giants follow and not commit to biting.  I remembered at about 3pm that there is a big tourney on Muskoka tomorrow, unfortunately, I cant fish it.  hope I didnt burn anyones water.  My fish wouldnt help anyways, but I know where some pigs are lurking!  Lots of OOS smallies today, I couldnt believe the aggression.  I caught 5 smallies on an 8 inch swimbait!!  Best of luck to those out tomorrow, hope you can catch em!!!     Ah well, beats sittin at home  P.S. The lip grips were a joke"
