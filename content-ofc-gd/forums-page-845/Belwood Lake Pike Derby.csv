201458,KyleM,2008-05-14 05:02:00,218,Not as good as it used to be. I think BigCliff used to frequent it. I used to go as I lived 3 min from the lake.....kinda gave it up when all the good prizes left.
201472,Big Cliff,2008-05-14 09:45:00,6899,"Use to love going to it. Five years running our boat took one of the top three prizes. Don't remember it costing that much or having to pay for launching though. That was one lake where either you were on them and knew what you were doing or got skunked. Best bait was 6-8"" sucker minnows under a bobber and patience."
201473,nancur373,2008-05-14 09:54:00,1211,Yeah that's what I mean by next weekend. This weekend is the one comming up. Next weekend is the one next week.
201495,e-z-out,2008-05-14 12:24:00,1052,would love to go but no boat for another 2 and half weeks
202772,SBCregal,2008-05-17 01:27:00,688,"looks like me and a buddy of mine may be going to enter. never been in an event like this before, hope to see others out there  ryan"
343496,bassmastermike,2009-05-21 04:43:00,295,Ill Be there forsure !!! How much is camping ???
343505,Marko,2009-05-21 10:54:00,854,From what i heard pike fishing there isnt what it used to be. Every year fish get smaller and smaller. Good luck to whoever goes tho!
343512,danbouck,2009-05-21 11:39:00,4380, I don't think they have camping there. check out www.grandriver.ca
343571,SBCregal,2009-05-21 14:40:00,688,am i the only one who noticed this thread is over a yr old?
343573,pike slayer,2009-05-21 14:48:00,1177,diggin up the dead!!
343937,nancur373,2009-05-22 14:57:00,1211,Yes but it is relative again right now.
343938,nancur373,2009-05-22 14:59:00,1211,"I'll be in a red Thornes 15.5 tinny. Old chipping paint with the numbers scraped off.( due to them being phony in the first place). 1974 Johnson 9.9 white hood, green leg. There'll be me and Alie Goby"

343961,jediangler,2009-05-22 16:56:00,1923,"Don't be surprised if the derby gets CANCELLED sometime late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  http://news.therecord.com/News/BreakingNews/article/540976  If they don't find this poor fellow today, I'd be very surprised if they let a few hundred fishermen drag hooks through there tomorrow."
343968,nancur373,2009-05-22 17:26:00,1211,Oh my. I had no idea. I hope they find him. Not for the fishing aspect but for the family. Life jackets are a must.  Curt
343969,bdox,2009-05-22 17:31:00,329,I hope the fishing is better this weekend than last. We didn't even get a sniff of a pike.
343980,Lunker777,2009-05-22 18:31:00,866, According to the article... the man was found ?
343983,jediangler,2009-05-22 18:44:00,1923,"They've updated the article now and yes his body has been found. I'm sure the tourney will go on now as planned. If you are going in the tourney, take a lesson here and wear your PFD at all times on the water. Those who talk about the state of the Belwood pike fishery being bad are right, it sucks. But where else will catching a 24"" pike get you $1500. If you catch even a little one, take it in, it might be the biggest one caught."
343984,SBCregal,2009-05-22 18:46:00,688,"i think the winner last year was around 32"" if i remember correctly. the only fish we boated was one i caught...about 18"""
343992,spinnerbaitking,2009-05-22 19:30:00,1622," I have camped on the north side of the lake between Belwood and Fergus, they even have a boat ramp for campers (  http://www.highlandpines.com/ ) there are pike in the area just fish the willows around shore or the islands, best of luck to all and tight lines wish I was there, working nights Richard"
