299021,tdotfisherman,2009-01-29 15:49:00,317," Over the last few years my fishing obsession has really picked up.. I've come to realize that fishing, and being in the beautiful Canadian north is the closest thing to heaven on Earth. In discovering this, I've tried to turn some of my friends on to fishing so I can show them just how much enjoyment you can take out of it. When I take someone fishing with me for the first time I always love to try and put them on some Northern Pike.. not only are they somewhat easy to catch with some basic know-how, but they can grow to be quite large, and put up a great fight..  My first Northern Pike had me hooked on this sport for life! It's my hopes that it can do the same to some of my friends and family.."
299022,limeyangler,2009-01-29 15:50:00,5204,"I have not caught a musky...but pike...lol....its actually pretty hard not to catch them....up here anyway. Ive spent many a happy hour or ten with the wife throwing topwaters for pike...in fact thats how i discovered some excellent bass fishing on a lake here...we were going for pike but started catching bass....and i never even knew there were bass in this lake!   I know its different on different bodies of water....but at ice out in front of our house....i use a slip bobber from shore with a big ...big minnow or sucker minnow.   Then i'll get 'em while jigging for walleyes with a smal jig and minnow.   When i specifically target them i'll head for weeds with topwater 'poppers' or my absolute favourite the yellow with black spots Mepps Comet #3....my buddy likes spinnerbaits.   I have even caught them whilst using downriggers for Lake trout, on 8"" Nasty Boyz.   I think somebody already said you may be trying too hard.    I am always amazed what a pike will try to eat....i have thrown some hideously unnatural looking baits...all colors of the rainbow and they slam it! I find up here they love orange colors....its almost as if the noise and color just annoys them into hitting.   By the sounds of it your gonna have some fun this spring with all the new lures you got.....i get the feeling it wont be long beefore i see a good report from ya with a nice picture of a giant pike...tight lines dude!"
299028,MJL,2009-01-29 15:54:00,2427,"Lots of pike around the Toronto harbourfront and the islands.  I used to bring my fly rod to the islands in the spring and I’d get small ones in the canals usually under 5lbs – My PB is 13lbs. When I’m carp fishing the islands, I sometimes hook into pike on corn and boilies as soon as the rig hits the water – only landed a few as they chew through the line most of the time.  Haven't caught a musky yet but have seen some laying near shore along the Trent river."
299090,Dozer,2009-01-29 18:11:00,896,Opening day for pike at the Scarborough Bluffs.  Throw a smaller Mepps and you'll hit small ones under 5 lbs.  Toronto Islands are good but I dont know anything 'bout 'em.
299092,goteeboy,2009-01-29 18:18:00,175,"if you don't care about catching a bunch of small pike, go to little lake in barrie, west off the duckworth exit. rentals are not too costly if you split w/ a friend and you'll catch tons all day long. they will be in the 1-2 pound range with a few reaching 5ish."

299220,Kerry,2009-01-29 23:18:00,383, I just have to bring up the obvious.Pike season is open right now.You can walk on frozen water and get yourself to some pretty darn good pike spots all over southern ontario.It's not spring/summer/fall fishing but when a 10lber decides he ain't coming up your hole you ARE NOT going to be worrying about the time of year. At the very least you may find some good spots around lake areas you cast around  that hold pike.If they are there in the winter they are certainly going to be around the rest of the year.Get out there and help that addiction! Kerry
299224,Bernie,2009-01-29 23:33:00,3190,Fished a lot through my life but really have never targeted Musky. So never have caught one. Lots of pike though. My brother goes bass fishing in a lake west of here where there are many musky and no pike. As a matter of fact he says the musky are a pain. They tend to be pretty hard on his bass tackle.
299257,Rizzo,2009-01-30 00:54:00,4754,"I'm with Kerry. Get out ice fishing...no equipment required other than a nice minnow, hook, line and maybe an axe to reopen someone's previously drilled hole (if you haven't bought an auger yet). Head to l St. John over by the airport and you'll have no problem getting your pike. Once you are bored silly by catching pike, move on up to musky next fall."
299355,Marc Thorpe,2009-01-30 10:37:00,621,"Hey Addik,one things you want to pay attention is weeds Look for cabbage or coontail,this will give you a starting point of aquatic vegetation to fish all colors are good as long as its Black  Very much like cats,muskie like quick moving objects  Great video TJ, I certainly would ask Monique or Jaden,Keep Tj out unless you want you want presentations on getting intimate with a Honda  Them girls can teach you how to fish"
299359,singingdog,2009-01-30 11:10:00,1047,"My guaranteed formula for catching musky: tie on an expensive jerk-bait (LCs work, but anything that you spend a lot of time picking-out and more than $15 on usually works) or pretty much any other bass lure that you are loathe to lose (make sure you don't have a leader on), go to my favourite bass-spot and WHAM! Musky.  Honestly, you need to get up this way. I can put you on lakes where the issue is keeping medium sized musky - up to 36"" - off your line while bass fishing. I don't do it from shore, but plenty of folks in downtown Haliburton catch musky from shore while targetting bass or walleye.  If you're fishing for the monsters, specialised tackle and lures may be necessary. I have landed dozens on MH bass tackle, 20 lb braid and white/chart spinnerbaits."
299434,pikeie,2009-01-30 15:55:00,380," yes there is alot of small pike in little lake. but if u go early  spring and kno where to fish you can cattch them over 10 lbs!! ive only caught 2 over 10 in that lake but if u fish shallow ( up to 6"" of water) you will get them. o and both of the ones over 10 were on the fly in under 12"" of water."

Started bringin it in.. and it fought back lol.. Turns out someone snaped their line on it.. Got it home.. cut it open and there was another pike about 8 inches inside.. lol This was.. ohh about 1996..  Largest Musky.. about 10 inches..  of course it went back.  Ive never really fished for them.. mostly trout and bass.. But this year I am going to be targeting them. Found a nice clear lake with lots close by at 15 FOW you can see bottom! FishFinder recorded a average depth of 21 but hit 49 FOW.. Now just need a boat or someone that wants to go out for a day! ) .. I was out with a buddy but he wanted crappie and the weather wasn't the greatest so we didn't stay long. But in the few casts I did, I had 3 followers all about 24""  Bout 1998 I was with relitives up on GBay, my cousin was using a lure about 12"" long going after large pike/musky.. well I was fishing for bass or what ever else I could get.. running 7' Rod with 12lb test.. well turns out he attracted in a group of 5 fish.. Musky.. Pike.. I don't know.. all were 48"" Plus..   Could see my jig below the doc, next thing I know one of the fish grab it..  Needless to say.. my setup was not ment for something that big! He Ran.... and ran hard.. bout 10 seconds he stripped over half my reel!! I snugged up my drag a little.. SNAP.. lost em..  Auctually I did end up cathing a larger pike there.. I know I have it on video someone from the old camcorder.. From what I remember it was about 24""  Thats about all my experience with Pike/Musky  Hoping that will change this year!!! I have a Med-Heavy Spin Rod with 30lb line, and a Med BaitCaster with the same line..  Looking to buy a Musky Rod and Reel this summer thou!"

I HOPE  I've already bought ALL THE EQUIPMENT and LURES I need to catch these, but what I'm finding is... because I primarily fish from shore... my best time to catch these fish is after ICE-OUT...  2 questions...  1) Has anyone on here NOT CAUGHT a PIKE/MUSKY before? and... 2) Are there other times of year that I can catch these types of fish... but FROM SHORE? (keeping in mind, I only know a select few places that go pretty deep after a cast is made in and around their habitat)  Grrrrrrrrrrr..... this is driving me insane, knowing I've spent all this money... only to find out I have a ""short-window"" of opportunity to catch one!"

Dangle pinner minnows for perch, you'll get pike.  There are pike specific lures and tactics, but with pike, everything is a pike lure."
298898,outllaw,2009-01-29 11:49:00,1232,remember fish where theres fish. lots of water does not hold the species you want.
298904,OhioFisherman,2009-01-29 12:16:00,6623,"First plan should be to have fun, fish or no fish!  Not many pike here in Ohio, mostly in Lake Erie tributaries and it seems only early in the season when the water is still cold (spawning areas). Seen pictures and reports from people getting them in the Toronto harbor area early season, you might try there?  Nothing fancy to getting them here, we get the on basic bass tackle, small crank baits, spinner baits, just certain areas to expect them and certain areas not to.  Just me, but if I am targeting them, steel leader time, just poor success landing pike or skis with out one. They are shallow early spring, caught them in 3 or feet of water near shore. Although I did most of my fishing from a boat an easy cast from shore."
298909,tinbanger,2009-01-29 12:50:00,1028,"took me most of this year to get my first Muskie , as far as pike they seem to be hard not to catch at times. Try the water around Ontario place this spring ,see multiple posts each year of Pike caugt from shore .  Pike fishing can certainly be a blast , we have a certain shallow bay we hit each spring , nothin better than a 30"" plus fish in 12"" water   Now you got me thinking bout spring  TB"
298913,Drew_10,2009-01-29 13:02:00,111,"The 1 musky I have caught in my life was from shore.  I was on a field course in Peterborough last September with my program and the group I was with was staying at a lodge on Lower Buckhorn Lake.  Caught it off the dock on my 2nd or 3rd cast with half my class watching.  It was just a little guy, maybe 30-32'', but man was I pumped!"
298920,Ramble,2009-01-29 13:19:00,713,Pike arnt the most difficult fish to catch that's for sure. Your spots with the drop sound good as long is there is some weeds along it. Once the weeds are out give it a shot. Early season... creek mouths are the place to be. Gives you a chance to target the post spawners. Your next choice should be marina's early season. The water warms faster in protected harbours cut off from the main lake and they are pike magnets.  Good luck and don't over think the problem too much. Keep casting.  -Dave
298922,tinbanger,2009-01-29 13:25:00,1028, So what would be a 'decent' fish ? LOL tb
298926,Fisherman,2009-01-29 13:32:00,7201,"I caught the odd pike just by being in the right place/time, although not targeting them. As for musky, no, I have no interest in catching any, they stink, and I can just imagine what they taste like.  If I'm going to catch it, I'm going to eat it and no, I'm not related to Darryl, but I like his fish fry batter."

298938,BillM,2009-01-29 14:23:00,17367," lol!!!!  Marc, how many do your clients catch?  :EDIT:  Addicted2fishn, I had the same prob last year.  It was my goal to actually get a muskie bigger then 12inches   For opener I hit the French River, cast after cast without even a sniff.  Spent 3 days chasing them, nothing but pike and a few monster smallmouth bass.  I hit Balsam when the weather got warmer to try and get this skunk off my back.  Seeing that the Kawartha's have a decent quantity of fish, I thought for sure I'd get into one.  Well I picked the warmest, bluebird day you could ever imagine.  Guess what?  No fish, no sniffs, no nothing...  Then one day I picked up some new blinge from Jose and was itching to try it out (Shimano Calais)..  Hitting a few nice bass out on Gloucester Pool right before sunset..  The sun goes down and my dad and I continue to chuck away.   I lob my Zara Spook Jr over a weed edge into about 15ft of water.  The water absolutely explodes and I know exactly what I have on..  It wasn't a monster, maybe 36inches or so, but man did that ever get the blood pumping.  I was as giddy as a schoolgirl when we finally got her into the net.  A quick pic (horrible by the way, so fuzzy you can barely make out the fish) and back she went.   I guess the point to my little story is that you'll get one when you least expect it, just keep at it!!!"

298990,Zubris21,2009-01-29 15:15:00,563,"If you are a bass fisherman you will catch a pike sooner or later!  Pike generally like the same habitat, shallow weedy flats near a drop off.  Find a weed patch and retrieve a spinner along the outside edge.  Pike will often be waiting in ambush.  Another good spot for pike is where the water body ""bottle necks"" they will wait on the lee side waiting for passing fish then come out and nail them.  I've found the best place for this in harbours where the break walls open into open water.  Difficulty is you need a boat or a deep pocket to take care of the tresspassing sign if you plan on going from shore.  Seeing as you are from TO there will be many early season pike reports from the area in the spring.   Use the search function and try to find some of them from last year.  I think I remember quite a few people going out to the island, but exactly where I'm not sure."

You can catch Northerns anywhere in Ontario pretty much, and it doesn't take that much skill to get em'. Even in Lake Ontario they are generally easy to catch from shore.. Musky aren't nearly as abundant as Pike, and you need to specialize your gear to get them.. you need big rods, big lures, heavy line, and usually a boat. Oh yeah, don't forget you need a lot of time on the water to get them, especially in big water.."
