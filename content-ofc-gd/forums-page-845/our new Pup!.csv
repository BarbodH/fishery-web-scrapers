Sadie is a 13 week old Shepard/lab mix .Great little dog so far .Excellent temperment , no too timid but also not to agressive.House trained 80% of the time and is getting better on the leash .  She is a Midland native so I'm hoping she will be some good luck this year on Gbay.  TB"
343652,bassassin,2009-05-21 19:20:00,152,"Dont want to rain on your parade but, judging by the look in her eyes she may have already mastered the i didnt mean it pose!!! for example you come home and your shoes are slightly chewed thats the face shell give ya!!!!"
343653,blaque,2009-05-21 19:21:00,2419,"wow, you can totally see both breeds in her. Big shepard ears and that lab nose.  cool little doggie, and she looks like shell be loads of fun.  My uncle breeds german shepards, and you wouldnt believe how timid those ""police"" dogs can be lol. One of his own is actually named ""sissy"" lol"
343655,tinbanger,2009-05-21 19:24:00,1028,Luckily chewing hasn't been an issue in the week we have had her . digging is another storey LOL TB
343677,motv8tr,2009-05-21 20:05:00,2587,"She sure is cute Dave!!!  My Sheppards ears didn't stand until he was 16 wks old...he liked to carry things, the bigger the better, sometimes it was a basket ball others, a 2x4x6'...could take ya out at the knees...lol  I'm sure you guys will all enjoy her and leave Matt very jealous  Maureen"
343687,Joey,2009-05-21 20:29:00,9122,What a gorgeous dog.  Congratulations to you and your family.  Joey
343695,blarg,2009-05-21 20:38:00,289,"according to the animal shelter where i got him thats exactly the mix my dog has too, though my fella weighs in a 160lbs so maybe there something else in there, he's a very good dog, couldn't ask for better from an animal his size, congrats im sure you'l have a blast with her."
343753,Greencoachdog,2009-05-21 23:01:00,8163,"By the looks of those ears, she may be 1/3 shepard, 1/3 lab, and 1/3 BAT!!!  .. just kiddin' ya TB!  She'll grow into those ears!  A lab shepard mix should be a very good dog, docile with the family... but a good protector too!"
