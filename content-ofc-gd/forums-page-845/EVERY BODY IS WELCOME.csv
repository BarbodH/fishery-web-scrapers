343493,PERCHER,2009-05-21 04:24:00,787,"Wel I invited Mikethe Pike and his young lad Ryan down for 3 days of utter Salmon Slammin.So far their wil be Mike,Ryan.Rob,(memart)Brian (SlowPoke) Peter(Bitme)And Who ever else would like to come out.Weather so far is looking good.And with a bunch of boats out ther we can share the info of the bite so we all end up with  burnning arms. We will be launching out of Bronte at 6 a.m and packing it in when every body has had there fill of Salmon slammin. Maybe we could all hook up at a resteraunt for some wings and pops afterwords. So who ever wants the offer is open to all. Dan"

343559,heri0n,2009-05-21 13:48:00,27,hey i'm a newbie so forgive my questions.. but i thought salmon season was in the fall? is there any special equipment required to catch salmon right now and do you need a boat?
343563,Fang,2009-05-21 14:01:00,1330,Up until last night thast was my plan as well but the darn water pump on my 115 Merc has decided otherwise.  Put the water mufflers on and stared up with no flow. Dropped the whole lower unit in a barrel and still no flow. Looks like I'm dry docked for a bit.  I'll be listening in on channel 72 so keep the chatter going guys
