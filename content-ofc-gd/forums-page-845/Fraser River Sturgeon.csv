343614,MJL,2009-05-21 17:18:00,2427,Sea food probably can't get fresher than that  I've always wanted to go to the Fraser to try my hand at catching the ultimate bottom feeder  Awesome report and great pics.  Thanks for sharing
343730,steverowbotham,2009-05-21 21:48:00,1800,jealous wouldnt properly describe my feelings
343783,Leecher,2009-05-22 00:08:00,7832,Awesome report and pics Shayne You guys sure got into some great action fighting them prehistoric creatures!!!  I've only caught one 11Lbs one on the Ottawa and thought that was the ultimate....  but after seeing your brother's.... well mine was just bait.  Great job you guys and thanks for taking the time to post and share with us Leechman
343798,tibbs,2009-05-22 00:41:00,650,Looks like you had a great time there!
343877,Sinker,2009-05-22 11:43:00,8692," Yep, we had a great time!! Thanks again for the info before I left!!  Sinker"
343886,Greencoachdog,2009-05-22 12:29:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Sinker!!!  I don't know if I'd have fished for the Sturgeon or went for some Halibut... that'd be a tough choice!  Glad you had a great time and got to see your brother!!!
343931,fishnsled,2009-05-22 14:23:00,3520,"One day I will get there, who wants to come?      Great report Sinker."
343936,Mike Pike,2009-05-22 14:49:00,1332,"What a fantastic post Sinker!  What a lifestyle out on the coast you got to sample with the fresh fish and all.  Man, it makes me wonder what I'm doing living in Hamilton!!!"
344026,Sinker,2009-05-22 22:00:00,8692," Thanks for the comments folks!  I hear ya Glen. I did look into a halibut trip, but it was more money, and much, much farther to go to get them. The place we fished was only 40 mins from my bro's place, and we got a deal because it was the slow time of year for sturgeon. It was a last minute trip that just came out of the blue. I made the best of the little time I had out there, and my limited funds at the time. If I ever get back there again, halibut is on my list for sure. I'd love to go bottom fishing out there!!!  Sinker"
344028,Jigger,2009-05-22 22:14:00,1237,"Congrats on the Sturgeon man! Looks like a great time out there. Haven't been to the W coast in some time. That report kindof gave me the itch to get back out there. When you start scheming about a Halibut trip, drop me a line, its on the to-do list for sure!"
344131,Sinker,2009-05-23 03:30:00,8692, Its gonna be a while yet bud. I have a trip to the east coast planned first. I gotta get me some fresh codfish der b'ye!
344146,brandon,2009-05-23 04:47:00,857,great report...I drive over the fraser daily....i really gotta get on this whole sturgeon fishing thing
344152,jace,2009-05-23 09:40:00,472,"   A sunny day with 10 fish on 2 lines is a pretty good day by any standard.    I hope the iced salmon in the picture isn't where your ""sockeye"" came from.  LOL.   there were some pretty marked up tigers in there.  Did you try any of the yellow eyes in the picture?  They are excellent eating fish, and with any luck, you'll get those the next time you're over there fishing for halibut.   Remember to ask how fast the boat is when you ask for the charter's halibut rates."
343126,Sinker,2009-05-20 03:40:00,8692,"Me and my mom did the tourist thing last week in Vancouver. It was a bit of a whirlwind trip, but we gotter done. Had a good visit with my brother, caught a few fish, and ate lots of seafood! LOTS of stuff to see down there, but my main goal was to put a white sturgeon on my list. I got there wed, had a guide booked for Friday on the Fraser. She's a big ole dirty river......not what I was expecting.        First thing on my agenda was to get my fill of seafood That's pretty much all I ate the whole time I was there Wed afternoon we headed down to the fishermans wharf in Steveston. Grabbed a small sockeye, a few crabs, and some fresh large prawns........yeehaw.....lets eat!!              The salmon was killer!    Thursday, we just toured around Van. Lots of stuff to see. I took around 400 pics in 6 days, so I'm still sorting through them. I might do a NF report with them later, but for now, lets get on with the fishing  We were to meet our guide in mission for 8am. We got there early, but our guide was ready to go. Heres our ride for the day. 22ft Jet, powered by a 454        The guide warned me prior to booking that the really big fish were hard to come by at this time of year, but we'd get into some fish for sure. I was happy with that. Any sturgeon would be fine with me. We did the intro's, the safety talk, and headed out.      Friggen awesome backdrop for pictures. The place is beautiful.    We set up the rigs, which were pretty simple. Heavy line, heavy weight and big stinky bait. We were running 120lb PP, with a 20 oz. slip weight. 2 rods had smelts for bait, the other had a huge honkin roe bag full of salmon skien. The current was running ~6MPH with LOTS of floating and submerged debris!    We got the lines out and waited. It didn't take long for a rod to fire. My brother was all over it!    Just a little guy, but we were on the board!    The key to getting bites was to keep moving. Even 100ft would get a bite. The water was running high and super dirty, with lots of debris, so instead of checking lines and re-setting, we'd just move a little each time. It paid off, because every time we re-set, we'd get a hit. The water was really high and dirty, so you had to pretty much put your bait right in front of them to get bit, and we found most fish sitting behind current breaks. Its all scent, water visibility was about 2"" tops.  Next fish was all mine. I was friggen pumped. When the outside rod fired on my side, I was on it like a fat kid on a smartie!! FISH ON!!    I knew right away it wasn't a monster, but it had a good headshake, and peeled some line. I had no idea what I was into, but knew for sure it was a sturgeon. I got her to the boat with no  problems, it didn't take as long as I thought it would.  My first ever white sturgeon.      Crazy looking fish. The skoots on the sides are like razors, hence the pretty gloves.....    At this point, I was a happy camper. I could care less if we got anymore fish, but we kept on fishing. We lost a bunch, missed a bunch, and caught a few more in the next couple hours. It was pretty much move, set lines, get bit, either land, lose or miss a fish, then repeat.  My brother hooked into something a little bigger than what we'd been getting. The fight was on, with jumps, runs and lots of dogging on bottom. After the first jump, the guide just sat down and said ""your gonna be a while"" After about a 15 min battle, we got this fella in the boat.    My brother couldn't have been any happier. This is the biggest fish of his life. I was happy he got it, it made the day for sure.      I finished the day with 4 boated, my brother only landed his 2. The biggest, the first, and the smallest. Heres a couple more pics of the fish.....      I lost the last fish of the day, and it was a good one. It jumped about 4 ft out of the water, and was about the same size as my brothers big one. It was a real heart breaker, but, that's fishing. You can't get them all. I got my sturgeon crossed off the bucket list, so I was more than happy. The guide was a really good guy who knew his stuff, and worked all day to keep our rods bent. We lost a lot of fish. Its hard to keep the barbless hooks in on the smaller fish, with such a huge weight. You just can't keep enough tension on the hook, with the smaller fish. We must have dropped easily 10 fish. It was all good fun though. I'd like to go back in the fall when the big boys are in there!!  Sinker"
343129,holdfast,2009-05-20 03:54:00,1813,"Awesome report.  Great Pics and excellent fishing.  Yup, that river current is extremely fast.  Try bridging Pontoons togeather to create a floating Raft.  Our Boat Operaters really have to have it togeather.  How was the Weather, Lots of Rain?"
343133,Sinker,2009-05-20 03:58:00,8692," The weather was mint!! It rained the first night we were there, and stayed clear with no wind the rest of the trip. We got lucky I guess. I took my rain gear with me everywhere I went, but didn't put it on the whole trip. My brother said we were weather gods, because the day we left, it started raining.... LOL. I get home to a nice sunny warm day, but apparently it was crap weather here all weekend........suckers  This week isn't looking too shabby either  Sinker"
343134,drwxr,2009-05-20 04:02:00,453,you guys are so lucky...great report!!!

343141,Sinker,2009-05-20 04:58:00,8692," Thanks Rob, it was  a blast! When we goin salmon fishin?   They must be getting close, no?    Your more than welcome Roy, its my pleasure.  Sinker"
343147,brifishrgy,2009-05-20 08:19:00,559,  Thats why it didnt rain .. if you forgot it one day it would have rained  for sure .. the sturgeon is on my list of must catches

343197,rock34,2009-05-20 13:22:00,215,Awsome report Sinker!!  I am visiting a friend in Chilliwak this summer and we are looking at booking a charter for Sturgeon.  I take it you would recommend this company?  What was the name?  Thanks again for the awsome report. Cheers.
343210,Jet,2009-05-20 13:50:00,364,"Great job Sinker, couldn't of happened to a nicer guy! Next time I'm out in BC I'm gonna have to give that a try. Thanks for sharing."
343216,limeyangler,2009-05-20 14:01:00,5204,"Crazy ooking fish!  Awesome report, what a species to add to your list, congrats on your PB!  shame about the last fish that got off....aint that always the way!?   Sea food looked good too.  Thanks for p[osting."
343226,Zubris21,2009-05-20 14:16:00,563,Great stuff!  I've gotta get down there and give that a try!  Thanks for sharing.
343289,Sinker,2009-05-20 16:48:00,8692," Thanks for the comments folks!  Yep, I'd recommend our guide for sure. He worked hard to keep our rods bent. The company name is STS guiding service. I actually found them from watching the Fish'n Canada show. They were there again the week before I was. They will guide for just about anything with fins. Primo equipment, and sweet boats.  Sinker"
343296,crappieperchhunter,2009-05-20 17:02:00,2582,"Good on you Shayne. I was waiting for this report.  A visit with family, some west coast seafood, a whack of Sturgeon and mint weather. Sounds like it all came together perfectly.  Congrats on a great vacation and thx for sharing."
343297,tbayboy,2009-05-20 17:24:00,1497,"Great right up Sinker.  Really well written report, makes me want to hop on a plane right now!  Thanks for sharing."
343318,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-20 18:27:00,0,Nice deal bud!
343321,Spiel,2009-05-20 18:39:00,9065,"Super, I'd love to tangle with one of those babies someday. Looking forward to seeing some more of the 400 odd pictures."
343453,rob v,2009-05-21 00:54:00,535,"Looks like you had a great trip Sinker.   My wife and I are planning a trip to visit my daughter at hell's Gate this summer.  One of the things I had on my wish list was a strugeon fishing trip also.  I'll have to look these guys up.   What was their pricing like  ? I""ll be fishing alone  cause I'd never talk my wife into it so I may need to pair up with someone they may have booked already ?"
343454,buckster,2009-05-21 01:01:00,530,Right on Shayne....  Now get out there and get some simcoe(whitie) Sturgeon.....  We have been layin a beating on em!
343455,solopaddler,2009-05-21 01:07:00,8605,"Fantastic report, glad to see you were able to live your dream. But dude, you used the pose in one of your sturgeon pic's.  "
343482,Sinker,2009-05-21 03:01:00,8692," The rates are charged on a per person basis. If its just yourself, it shouldn't be a problem, unless they are busy. Even if they were, I'm sure you could work out something to join a group. Best time of year to go for the big ones is Sept. They are priced fair once you start shopping around. You get what you pay for also.      I was just waiting for you to pipe up about that one. I did that just for you........not bad huh  Looks pretty good with an ugly fish too.......whaddya think?  Sinker"
343502,solopaddler,2009-05-21 10:28:00,8605,  I like!
