He caught a pike that was 18"" but I wasn't close enough to take a pic.  I caught this one that was 24"" on a white 1/8oz jig & grub combo that Griff said he caught his on.  I also caught 6 crappies, 3 rockbass (WGSF) and 2 small largies on the same white grub combo. The crappies were all around 8 or 9"" long and all went back in the drink. The wind was picking up so we pulled out at 1:30pm after starting around 9:30am."

343499,Stern Rules,2009-05-21 06:37:00,342,"Any good fishing from shore there, especially for crappies?"
343506,Marko,2009-05-21 11:00:00,854,Nice few fish you guys got there. Fishing from a kayak sounds like something that would make me a little paranoid but could probably get used to it. THats one  dark crappie or my screen is dying lol. Way to go  guys
343525,jediangler,2009-05-21 12:19:00,1923,"There are some shore spots for crappie, Stern Rules. Marko your computer screen is fine, the crappie were very dark."
343564,joonmoon,2009-05-21 14:08:00,528,"Hey bro, nice job on the pond. Pics look good and the camera brkt is all good. Good to see Griff out there and he's got a real nice ride eh!. Keepin the yak on the roof I see...might as well. Go get em Jedi...lol."

343612,MJL,2009-05-21 17:15:00,2427,Great report Jedi!  Well done on those catches.  I've only fished there once 6-7 yrs ago.  I only caught lots of small perch and had 1 small pike hit a topwater lure - couldn't connect with it though.  I might have to take the canoe out and try it again this year.  Thanks for sharing
