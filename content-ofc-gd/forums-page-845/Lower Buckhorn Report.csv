So the last 2 days I was up and had the lake more or less to myself I probably saw only 10 - 15 boats all day. The wind was up on Thurs. and so was the temp. close to 30C and so was the water level still very high and running fast in the narrows and several rocks are under water that are normally exposed so be careful if you are out there Lower Buckhorn has lots of these rocky areas. The fishing was fast and furious for everything except what I was looking for the Walleyes. One spot was full of rock bass I probably caught 10 or so and some were pretty chunky this spot also resulted in a 1lb. smallie and some sunfish. Another spot was full of perch probably 15 to 20 again some good size and also a 1.5lb largie as well. The perch fishing was non stop and then was gone and you know what that means.... I knew a big fish was around and had shut it down and then the muskie hit. It wasn't big by any means about 24"" but made my light weight walleye rod work. So I got to break in my new Frabil Net I picked up at the Sportsmen's show this year so it has been officially slimed the first time out lots of fun. Sorry there's no pics I forgot the camera but they would have been OOS anyway and I don't do those. Its funny when you try to catch a musky its hopeless and when you don't its easy oh and by the way all fish were caught on a simple night crawler go figure. Now if I could just find those EYES !!Looking forward to a good season hopefully pics to follow!!  Kawartha Kev"
