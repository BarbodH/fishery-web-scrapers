343632,sneak_e_pete,2009-05-21 18:25:00,540,"I know, I know.  I work full-time and my wife and I have a home based business that occupies every second that our 22 month old son and 7 week old son doesn't.  Promised her we would just hang around the cottage.  May throw a line in from shore, but no real fishing.  I booked myself a trip to Rice lake for Bass opener for 3 days...no wife, no kids.....ahhhhhhhhhhhh."

Also, cast from shore if you can, there are some nice pike to be had and a ton of bass if you'll be there after opener.  Nice crappie right in the harbour there too"
