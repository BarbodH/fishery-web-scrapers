I'm a new owner of my first boat, and I'm looking for a lake or river that i can launch my boat and have a good day on the water, had it out for the first time on lake Ontario, in and around the bay, no such luck, still a great day on the water, but would be even better if we were pulling in the goodies.  anyone have any suggestions on where i can launch my boat around southern Ontario where fish have been hitting?  I'm from Hamilton, I'm looking for somewhere not too far of a drive.  lets hear about these spots guys....."
344051,rbaquial,2009-05-22 23:52:00,968,best bet is to checkout Google Maps .... and follow the shoreline of where you plan to go.... lots of marinas out there....
344053,crappyfisherman,2009-05-22 23:58:00,35,"ok great, that will help with the boat launch.... i only wish they had a search for where the fish are hitting.  any one been having any luck anywhere around hamilton or with in a short drive?"

344058,crappyfisherman,2009-05-23 00:12:00,35,Grand R... ive had some luck in there.... ive always launched below the damn in dunville... would you launch above or below the damn?
344066,CLofchik,2009-05-23 00:49:00,854,"Below at Fishmasters tackle shop, just a little bit further down the road, $5 to launch."
