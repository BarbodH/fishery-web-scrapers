115102,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-18 19:20:00,698,Good stuff.
115104,Roy,2007-09-18 19:23:00,13728,Good stuff TJ but I still say I shoulda starred in that one.
115111,misfish,2007-09-18 19:50:00,29133,"Wont work here. Never mind, got it. What no bass up there?LOL Nice one boss."
115121,SlowPoke,2007-09-18 20:33:00,2984,"I haven't seen it yet TJ. All I get on WFN is JP's interviews from ICAST Good spots JP, just funnin' ya. -Brian"
115123,ChrisK,2007-09-18 20:41:00,2772,Sweeeeet !!!!
115129,bigfish1965,2007-09-18 20:58:00,3382,I still don't get WFN here. Who's the geeky guy with glasses in the commercial?
115135,TJQ,2007-09-18 21:26:00,7806,"That would be me...  you dont need the equipment upgrade anymore to get wfn now.. i got it and the fight network and the soccer channel.. and something else for 5 bucks amionth... the ""catfighting"" o the fight channel is worth the 5 bucks all by itself..."
115143,fishdawg,2007-09-18 22:24:00,912, this is for Bell? I called a coupla weeks ago & was told I needed the upgrade...  are they trying to screw us city slickers?
115145,Jeff R,2007-09-18 22:33:00,94,"Don't have WFN, so first time I have seen it.  Well done"
115147,TJQ,2007-09-18 22:35:00,7806,"Last year I was told the upgrade was needed and I said... nah...  At the beginning of the summer I cancel most of my programming cause were never here anyway.. saves me about 100 bucks over the course of the summer... when I called to get my channels back, I saw the wfn package (the same company runs all the channels in that packages I think) and just for the heck of it i asked if i could get it and they said yes that the package had been switched to the main satelite and ... ta da... in 5 min. i had it all..."
115173,Krisco,2007-09-19 00:19:00,67,"TJ, I have seen it before but not for some time now. I think they may have condensed it a bit as I don't recall the big guy in an undersized boat being in the clip."
115176,Crazyhook,2007-09-19 00:21:00,1154,"I will keep an eye out...  I have not seen the Bedazzler commercial in a while "" HI I am Tana from national TV./.."" good god!"
115197,DT10Sam,2007-09-19 00:58:00,480,Good job I have seen it.  Sam
115217,chilli,2007-09-19 01:48:00,199,"Haven't seen it yet.  You don't need the upgrade. They gave me that load of bull. Goes right i hand with the ""you have to keep your phone line connected"" Bull! They tried telling me I needed the doulble LMB or whatever that prong is on the dish  Ask anyone with a single prong  that has free to air and they'll show you WFN and wild TV. Gee I wonder why people rip Bell off"
115232,CoolB,2007-09-19 03:39:00,47,I can verify this for TJ. I also just got WFN yesterday and didn't need the upgrade.  WFN and the Fight network. I'm loving it.
115254,fishdawg,2007-09-19 10:54:00,912,"thanks TJ 2 weeks ago I called Bell asking if I could drop a theme pack in exchange for the WFF package..  they said i needed it  called last night and asked again, they'r response:  ""sure no problem, anything else?""  buncha crooks!  hope the wife dosent miss the movie package....."
115257,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-19 11:04:00,2585,i watch wfn all the time.  i haev not seen the commercial yet on it.  it looks good though!  Cheers!
115270,Bly,2007-09-19 12:35:00,1556,"Looks good TJ, short and to the point, as all ads should be   Hope it brings in the business!!"
115301,bigbuck,2007-09-19 14:02:00,2449,Great commercial!! I don't get WFN cuz I can't be bothered to get digital or satellite tv. I'd become a total couch potato. I'm still in the stone ages with basic cable at home.
115579,motv8tr,2007-09-19 22:57:00,2587,"I haven't seen it yet, but then until I read this thread I didn't know I could get WFN.  I now have it  and I will be sure to let you know if and when I see it TJ  Maureen"
115750,fishindevil,2007-09-20 15:15:00,6254,"Well i have had WFN  since they started and i havnt seen it yet TJ. but i will be watching for it big time,i think its a cool short video...lets hope it works....cheers"
