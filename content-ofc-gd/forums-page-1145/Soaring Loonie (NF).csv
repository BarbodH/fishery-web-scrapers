116213,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-21 17:22:00,957,This began as a great thread until some posters started winging it by adding misinformation.  Don't think I'll stick around for the silly stuff.
116214,Vanselena,2007-09-21 17:28:00,269," You have a good point here, a cheaper $US means their debt is cheaper provided they previously made that hedge with Gold or some other currency. The other way they can have cheaper debt is through inflation. With high inflation the value of the dollar becomes less. One other way is for the US to simply print money to pay off their debt, since the US$ is no longer backed by gold and is supported by itself. Let the printing presses run at full steam, problem is  that devalues the US$, kinda like a company increasing it's # of shares while the companies value stays the same, the shares are worth less."

116166,Hookset,2007-09-21 15:10:00,367,"If the best that we as Canadians can offer to attract business is a ""low dollar"" then we are no better than Mexico or China. To rely on a low dollar to attract business is a recipe for disaster. We continually advertise ourselves worldwide as having a better educated workforce which offers high quality products and cutting edge technology. Then the dollar soars, and the crying starts about lost business due to the high dollar. Short term pain for a long term gain I say. A large part of the business we are losing will not be returning to the USA but will be headed for the next country which can offer production at a reduced dollar (see Mexico, China etc.) I've been in the Automotive business my whole life (until lately thank god) and I've seen the quality and technology of product this country can produce. It is second to none. Suck it up Canada, the business we lose to our high dollar was business that we would eventually lose regardless for corporations that care little about quality and only about production costs. We are better than that.  My opinion,   Hookset."
116179,wuchikubo,2007-09-21 15:37:00,1114,"Well with the higher dollar it my be looking more attractive for doctors to remain in Canada as opposed to moving south. Obviously, there are other factors than money, but I think we lose some new grads due to the money issue. If this holds up, hopefully, it can strengthen the medical heath care shortage issue."
116180,Zib,2007-09-21 15:42:00,369, Actually Mexico has been crying about losing business to China. I find that funny.    Now they know how it feels.
116181,lickmyarmpit,2007-09-21 15:46:00,359,"  Imagine that the last time our dollar was worth more than theirs is after they were losing a war!?!?!?               Nam 1972, Iraq 2007"
116182,Zib,2007-09-21 15:51:00,369," Can you define ""losing a war""? In Vietnam we won every battle but the war was unpopular with the public so it was a loss. The same thing is happening with Iraq. No country ever ""WINS"" a war; they are just declared the winners for the sake of having a winner & a looser."

116184,jedimaster,2007-09-21 15:53:00,3472,I generally term a loser in a war as follows. If an invading Country leaves they lose. If a defending country gets assimilated they lose.  Like when Canada and the US had a war Canada Won.  
116186,Zib,2007-09-21 15:56:00,369, What did Canada win?

116192,wuchikubo,2007-09-21 16:17:00,1114," General, indeed but not always true. It's only if the country is looking to take territory.  I.e.: Japan lost the war on their own territory but didn't get assimilated.  peace and be well."
116194,Zib,2007-09-21 16:24:00,369," You might want to re-read your history books. The War of 1812 didn't have a ""Winner"". The U.S. declared war on Britain because they were preventing our ships from delivering goods to France & because they were supplying the American Indians with arms to fight off whites settlers from taking their land.  The US didn't have an army to fight the war because New England refused to get involved with the war & the only military the US had was in New England so they had to use local militia that was poorly trained. The British used local Canadian militia & mostly American Indians to fight off the US attempt to push back the militia that was attacking its trade ships in the Great Lakes. Canada seen this as a victory because they prevented a foreign country from trying to conquer them; which the US never planned on doing in the first place. The US seen it as a victory because they felt that they won their independence once again from the British after they destroyed a large part of the British navy & were allowed to send their trade ships to France.  Basically the War of 1812 was just a pissing match over territorial rights."
116196,Fisherman,2007-09-21 16:31:00,7201,"You're right about being the highest debt ridden, however, I don't know about being the wealthiest.  With the amount of debt/deficit they have, they wouldn't have the proverbial pot to whizz in if everyone collected on what they owe.  On the other hand, maybe that's what they are trying to do, pay off their debts with ""cheap"" money.  I'm glad books are in the green, I don't mind the present value of the loonie."
116199,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-21 16:36:00,835,"I wouldn't celebrate, The States got caught in a mortgage scam and despite the warning of American planes carrying nuclear missiles Iran stops selling oil in dollars. If George can pass that of as an attack on the US economy he may use those missiles."
116202,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-21 16:46:00,0,"I understand GaryV that you are a business owner and rely on American business. But the Majority of us do not. I hear off all this gloom about Canada's economy going down if the USA dont buy from us? How did we ever survive without America?We actually did quite well.  Now that Mulrooney brought in all the cheap labour from 3rd world countries, they will be the ones most affected.  Companies are moving to other countries because they can. All thanks to Free Trade you seem to promote. If they weren't allowed to sell in our country they wouldn't be quick to move and someone else would fill the demand.  You talk about losing manufacturing jobs? Wake up! We have already lost them to China and America has lost it to Mexico, China, Canada and a host of other countries. That is why their GDP continues to shrink.  You bring up some very good points Rick, but the truth of the mater is that its not the high dollar that is the problem. Its outsourcing and free trade.  I hope the dollar soars and interest rates drop.  We ship alot of resources and the higher the dollar the more the profit, not to mention, more profit means we pay off our defeciet, which means more money for the government which means more services. Its a win, win situation. Nations know that we are a rapidly growing nation and our economy is strong. Many will invest....  Top traider. China is basically holding all the cards and the US knows it. They use their reserves in US dollars as leverage. If they start dumping the US dollars the US dollar will do a nose dive.  Lookingforwalleye. I would complain to your local MP. I have no problems at all getting any health related appointments. And even if they make me wait a few weeks, it still beats having to dish out a months pay...  Tennesse guy. The fact of the matter is that MANY us citizens are having financial problems.(well except the cocaine dealers and the hookers). Many people are either claiming bankrupcy or on the verge of. The housing market is coming to a complete halt, record numbers of foreclosures, millions without health care benefits.... Your GDP is shrinking at a fast rate....  Stock market is doing good? There are only a few companies, mostly tied with arms, energy and pharmacudicals that are doing great. The rest are hurting. And how does the fact that the rich are getting richer help out the average American? It doesn't.  The US may be ok but they are going to have to weather a huge Recession. The Americans have increased their borrowing to mask the recession but investors are losing confidence in the American dollar....."
116015,Garyv,2007-09-21 01:34:00,547,"Wow isn't it great the loonie is at par.... actually no it isn't.  Ever hear of the sterling truck plant?  They have been looking at getting out of Canada for a long time and now have the best excuse they ever had.  Higher wages then their US plants, more benefits and social programs to pay into etc etc etc.  Multiply that by the closings of other US auto companies facilities or the reduction of shifts. I know Toyota is building a plant but will they have a union? I will guarantee you that if the current trend lasts for the long run there will be plenty of manufacturing jobs lost to  Mexico, and other ""lesser "" emerging nations.  Companies are in business to make money not please workers and/or give into their demands. Unless you are in an energy Provence  people that loose their manufacturing jobs can work at the corner variety store with it's high wages and fantastic benefits, or better yet the Saviour of the Canadian job market...""The Phone Center industry"".  ( remember the Government keeps telling us about all the new job openings )  The poor retailer is in the middle.  Not lowering prices as they are trying to make up for all their past losses when the loonie was low, it's a catch 22.  I will make a prediction that if the loonie does not decline by Christmas, border community retailers will be hit and hit hard at Christmas time.  Why do I feel this way because when I was in business it happened before.  The Exodus to Port Huron Michigan at Christmas was daily for weeks prior to the holiday.  Don't get me wrong I fully understand people want to get the best deal, and I shop in the States myself but to think that the present loonie will not have an adverse effect on the economy in time just is not true.  Just got an idea, get into the travel business and starting in November organize shopping bus trips to border communities in the States...bet you could make a bundle on that one!"
116020,huntervasili,2007-09-21 01:40:00,1604,CBC has an interesting program on now about the loonie and its effects on the economy and us...
116023,luv2drift,2007-09-21 01:48:00,147,The yanks can't declare war on us they have everyone in Iraq!  Maybe we should invade them right now!  Never mind they have more hand guns there than we have soldiers.
