113995,mason05,2007-09-14 22:45:00,258,I'm heading into Rain Lake the last weekend of September.  I am familiar with the north end of the park but have never ventured in through the south west side.  We will be staying (hopefully) on the island on Rain Lake with daytrips to Hot Lake and Jubilee Lake.  I'm assuming there will be decent smallie fishing as they seem to be well established throughout the park.  Any advice or info on other species would be much appreciated.  Looking for specks and lakers.  Feel free to PM me.  Thanks everybody.  Corn Nug
