Hope to hit the tribs together soon. Must of hooked up with over a dozen chinny's but their just way to ugly for pictures, LOL !!!   "
115191,fatherof3,2007-09-19 00:44:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats"
115192,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-19 00:47:00,698,"Sweet, good job!"
115200,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 01:10:00,0,Nice clean looking fish. Thanks for posting.
115279,ccmtcanada,2007-09-19 13:15:00,7971,"Nice job!  About ugly chinnys....I thought this one was pretty...well, except for the blood....LOL "
115405,jdmls,2007-09-19 17:22:00,575,pretty when she was at the mouth......she won't be so pretty after a week of running up river.
115409,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-19 17:27:00,0,That first shot is really nice.  Congrats.
115550,Milty,2007-09-19 22:08:00,121,"  See another post about 'Glow in the dark cleos',...how come all the blood is on the pec's and tail and not the mouth?,...just curious?"
115555,ccmtcanada,2007-09-19 22:16:00,7971," Are you insinuating that I snagged it?  I hope not.  Blood comes out of the mouth and runs down...gravity, when I weighed it vertically it ran down.  Here's another one caught with a cleo...   Notice the blood in the mouth?  I hope this answers your question.  Any more questions?"
115560,Milty,2007-09-19 22:24:00,121,"like I said,...Just curious ...as I have witnessed a whole lot of snaggin and illegal fishing near mouths of rivers and up river,..it really pisses me off,...no offence to you personally,..but like I said,.. I Have yet to see a peir angler 'Angle' ,...due to the vantage point of my view I have witnessed enough to bring up the question that I did,...its all in the interest of conservation and well ...legal fishing,...can you agree?..No accusations ..just questions...and yes,...lining and flossing does usually result in blood in the mouth,...it isnt illegal, if bait and one hook are used,..but that seems not to happen much...CCMT,...b4 you get too offended,..Im simply pointing out what I have witnessed over the last few weeks,...not you personally..perhaps I shouldnt have singled you out,..but the blood all over the tail is a way too familiar sight...."
115566,BrownTown,2007-09-19 22:32:00,103,"hey milty..As being a fellow float fisherman i know more then enough of what your talking about...but if u look at that picture with the blood on the tail, u can also see that there is blood all along its underside... Secondly....I would higly doubt ccmt would snag a fish.. Peace"
115567,Bly,2007-09-19 22:32:00,1556,"Show some respect and not hijack Jdmls thread.  He caught some very nice fish, this is his report  Nice Coho's Jdmls!!!"
115569,Milty,2007-09-19 22:38:00,121,"Ugh...  ,...Not highjackin nothin,..those are great cohos and a great report,...wouldnt hijacking be more like posting pics of my own fish on someone elses report,.....  ,...oh thats right someone else did that....lol"
115587,Fisherman,2007-09-19 23:05:00,7201,"Well Milty, if you look real close, you'll see the blood just ahead of CCMT's right hand, under the jaw and right in the corner of the mouth."
115590,silveradosheriff,2007-09-19 23:12:00,1025,Ding Ding....
