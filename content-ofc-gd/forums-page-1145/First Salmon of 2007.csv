I have about $3000 worth of tackle and found them to only be fond of one lure:    It's the same one that was hot last year.  I was out last Thursday and tried several lures before switching to the 3/4 ounce green glow cleo with no bites.  After 2 or 3 casts, I got bit off. I fished last night from 9-12:30 and got a few hits but no fish landed.  Fish were jumping everywhere, but nobody was catching. Tonight, I went down about 10:30 pm.  A guy caught one bottom fishing and there was quite an ordeal landing his fish with the small net that he had.  THe guys eventually used two nets as the hooks were caught in the first net... I hooked my fish about 10 minutes later.  After about a 5 minutte tussle, I brought it close and christened my new net.  Thank you to the guy who landed it and took the pic! Without futher ado, here she is:  A 13-15 lb female full of eggs that I gave to a guy on his way home (after 4+ hours of no action).   More reports to follow..."
