115790,tributaryhunter,2007-09-20 18:04:00,108,"it will pick up again, the first little runs that were hanging around the piers already went up, the big runs are still out in the lake, keep trying and, you will hit them eventually, this warm weather is not helping either. cheers"

116054,xrap,2007-09-21 02:44:00,683,Nothing has gone up the creek so far. I talked to a guyt hat fished thier i the mornign after the bit of rain we had and he said the fish got to the reb bridge and then when the sun came out they turned around ad headed back to the lake.
116065,CLofchik,2007-09-21 04:13:00,854,"Alot of the fish infront of rivermouths have been hanging around for awhile now and really starting to turn dark.  The darker they get the slower the action on spoons.  Been getting one or two a day fishing Bronte dawn or dusk with something that rattles or wobbles.  Rattle Spots, Canadian Wigglers and J-13's have been dinging more fish than spoons the last week.  And there's still a good three weeks of salmon fishing left.  Plus there's lot's of Coho's around."
