115548,dsn,2007-09-19 22:06:00,1018,After lying in bed for a week and half. Jesus healed my serious back injury I was back out there taking things easy. 95% recovered. I thought with the past cold nights things would have made them disappear into the deep but I found them in about 1 foot of water with their heads stuck right into the last green weed clusters. They were all gathered together whispering to each other with their heads facing each other in the weeds.pppppppppsssssst  Must be discussing where to go next for the warm water. I sent most of the time searching for them so I only landed one cause I ran out of time. to fish.    dsn

115553,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 22:10:00,0, Nice carp.Welcome back and hope you make a speedy recovery.
115618,Victor,2007-09-20 01:03:00,1609,long time no see man! good to have you back ... haven't seen a carp for quite a while  hope that it will be 100% soon!
115621,Bly,2007-09-20 01:11:00,1556,Welcome back!!  Great that you are feeling better....nice carp!
115623,Beans,2007-09-20 01:25:00,3339,Nice fish...Hope it didn't put too much of a strain on your back...  Remember to take it easy...I speak from experience...
115629,MJL,2007-09-20 01:41:00,2427," Totally agree.  You need someone to help you with your fishing...Like a guide...One who:  - Baits up the area - Carries your tackle for you - Casts your rigs to the optimum spots on the lake - Fights the fish for you - Lands the fish for you - Nets the fish for you - Unhooks and releases the fish with care for you  You just need to provide the spots and a lunch for the day - It's all about a relaxing day for the client.  You can't go wrong  I charge $400/ day for all of these services.  But for you DSN, I'll take $50 off on your first trip.  It's a hard job you know...I'm willing to sacrifice my back in the hopes of providing a top notch service at bargain prices.  Book now before it's too late  Top angling...Nice fish...Methinks I may do a few more carping trips before the steelhead start calling"
115633,Crazyhook,2007-09-20 01:43:00,1154,nice fish dude! I am back on the carp prowl tomorrow
115695,ccmtcanada,2007-09-20 11:27:00,7971,Great to see you back and fishing!  Nice fish too.  Take it easy...back injuries are never fun...and rushing back into things is almost always a recipe for disaster.
115706,007,2007-09-20 12:33:00,537,Good to see you fishing dsn.  Hope the back is 100% soon.  007
115708,Roy,2007-09-20 12:37:00,13728,Glad you're on the mend. Don't rush things with back injuries though. Thanks for the report.
115713,OhioFisherman,2007-09-20 12:58:00,6623,"Glad to hear the back is better, take it easy for a while."
115724,wolfville,2007-09-20 13:50:00,396,"My back has been bothering me for the last month or so too. Although it didn't hurt to the point I have to stay in bed but its presense has been with me and reminding me everytime I landed a carp.  But again, if I don't fish, why do I need my back?? So, what about a visit to Peterborough tomorrow? You missed it last time, want to make it up to those carp? I'll do almost all what MJL said for you although I need double lunch for that ;-)"
