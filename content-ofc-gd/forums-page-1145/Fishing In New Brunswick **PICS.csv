115439,kayak fisher,2007-09-19 18:41:00,66,"Hey Everyone,  I returned from a trip to New Brunswick last week, and I figured that I would share some pics with you.  We were on a commercial fishing island just south of the mainland, called Grand Manan.  The people and the scenery there were incredible.  The picture of the wooden cage in the water is actually a herring weir.  It is a figure 8 design that the fish don't know how to escape from.  If you like Brunswick Sardines, these are the cages that trap the fish!   The picture of me in the kayak shows some black ABS cages behind me.  These are used for farming Atlantic salmon.  And finally the fishing pics, just some pollack that I caught off the local pier.....Yum!!  Enjoy the pics.     "
115446,BITEME,2007-09-19 18:46:00,1969,where im from down east the pollock around the warf we call Turd Pollock we dont eat them
115467,kayak fisher,2007-09-19 19:15:00,66,What a profound statement.  To each their own.
115509,Beats,2007-09-19 20:16:00,543,"  How about saying ""nice fish""."
115677,Riparian,2007-09-20 07:13:00,269,  I feel dumber just by reading that...
115693,mcallister.grant,2007-09-20 11:19:00,327,Nice fish!! Did you get anyhting else or just pollock?
115712,Zib,2007-09-20 12:53:00,369,Cool pics.    Thanks for sharing.
115727,ace10002,2007-09-20 13:59:00,12,Nice fish..
115737,fishindevil,2007-09-20 14:47:00,6254,"Great scenery !!!!!   and nice report,and yes those pollock are very tasty.  ..sounds like you had a great trip,thanks for sharingi loved new brunswick,the people are so freindly    cheers"
115738,kayak fisher,2007-09-20 14:48:00,66,"Thanks for the positive responses!  I was amazed to see that first response (??)  I caught some mackarel along with these pollock, but unfortunately I did not have my camera for those.  They were pretty small though.  If anyone is heading out east, make sure to pick-up a few mackeral rigs.  I was actually catching three fish at a time.  At some points I thought that I had hooked onto a monster, but three pollack put up a pretty good fight...lol.  Here are some pics from last years trip....Lobster and Perriwinkles (escargot)   Enjoy!   "
115748,Golfisher,2007-09-20 15:11:00,586,That is one HUGE lobster!
115749,Golfisher,2007-09-20 15:11:00,586,"Actually, that reminds me of Homer.  You could have had him as a pet, and then eat him while crying.  LOL!"
115939,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-09-20 22:13:00,135,Just curious to know if you baited the mackerel rig?  BTW.....I believe Homer called his pet lobster Pinchy.
115963,lew,2007-09-20 23:50:00,12767,"Good to hear you enjoyed your trip to New Brunswick, and congrats on the successful fishing.  It's truly a beautiful place & I've spent alot of time there myself and have criss-crossed it many times both by car and train. It also has some of the friendliest folks this country has to offer."
115969,addict,2007-09-21 00:02:00,475,very cool i would love to fish in the sea.
115986,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-21 00:44:00,0,Excellant Report!!I like seeing some salt water fishing reports. Especially from Canada! I got a map of New Brunswick from CAA and plan to visit there one day. We have a really scenic east and west coast for sure!!!!
116074,Mike the Pike,2007-09-21 05:28:00,3421,Nice pics man .Would love to catch 3 fish myself on the same line.  MTP
116082,ch312,2007-09-21 09:38:00,1590,mmmm....wrinkles (as the newfies call snails) dipped in vinegar. taste great but you gotta watch out for that exlax effect when you eat too many of them. i love everything down east so much better than morontario and id gladly move there if it were for the crappy jobs down there
116116,kayak fisher,2007-09-21 13:08:00,66,"Actually the hooks that I used to catch the pollock and mackeral were unbaited.  In the local shops (and Sprawlmart) around the coast they sell mackeral rigs that are a series of hooks, and they either have plastic or feathers on the hooks.  I had the most luck on the feathered hooks, and also on just about any spoon you want to cast.....  I would love to be able to move out east from TO, and be able to fish on the ocean every week.  That combined with the amount of fresh water fishing that is available in NB would make it a fisherman's paradise.  I absolutely intend to do another trip next year.  Happy fishing!"
