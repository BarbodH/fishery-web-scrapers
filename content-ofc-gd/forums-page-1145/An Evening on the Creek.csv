A can of worms and a few hooks & sinkers and I was set to go. It seems that all that wanted to bite tonight was bugle mouth trout, aka white suckers. I caught about 6 of them in various holes along the creek. They hit and fought just like trout, so I wasn't complaining too much.    Here's an interesting pic though. I guess they recently stocked the creek with brood stock specks, because one spot under a culvert was just loaded. I managed to snap one good pic of just a few of the thousands I was seeing.    Great to see. This particular creek can be an awesome brook trout spot at times thanks to the local stocking program."
