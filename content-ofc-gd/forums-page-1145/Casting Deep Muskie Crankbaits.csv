116169,fishinggeek,2007-09-21 15:15:00,325,"I think I might be doing something wrong here.  When I cast a deep muskie crankbait, everything's fine until I get close to the boat.  Then it goes under the boat (under my feet), and as I bring it closer, does some circle on the way up.  Is there anyway to stop this?  It just doesn't look right to me."
116197,Raf,2007-09-21 16:31:00,3495,it's fine.
116198,Roy,2007-09-21 16:34:00,13728,Built-in figure eights.
116200,Raf,2007-09-21 16:36:00,3495,"Yep Roy.  Precisely. The fish in my avatar came unglued at the boat just as I was cranking in a DDD from the deep a few wknds back, exactly the manor fishinggeek described.  It actually missed the bait, but made the mistake of showing herself.  I got her on a topwater a few hours later that evening."
116203,lew,2007-09-21 16:53:00,12767," WTG Raf, doncha just luv it when they follow the game plan !!"
116224,fishinggeek,2007-09-21 18:14:00,325,"I barely have any experience, so I was surprised that it's ok.  It really does look funny, and if I were a muskie, I think I'd be on to me.  But when you call it a ""built in figure 8"", it sounds better.  Thanks guys."
116225,fishinggeek,2007-09-21 18:15:00,325,Oh and beauty fish Raf.  WTG.  I'm still working on my first.
116226,Muskieman,2007-09-21 18:18:00,2472,"it's normal,, even the smaller dd's like the Wally Diver have a tendancy to do that, don't worry about it. In fact it will probably entice more strikes  it has a built in erratic behavior.  good amd keep some ice on that wrist...  ZZZZZZZZZZZING!"
