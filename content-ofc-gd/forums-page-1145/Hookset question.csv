In the short term, all kinds of weird things can look like trends.  other things to consider...do the larger baits have stinger hooks?  Also, if you're hooking muskies at boatside (not entirely uncommon  ), a pool cue rod with no stretch line can pull a fishes lips off (or the bait out of their mouth, whichever comes first)"
