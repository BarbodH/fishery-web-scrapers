115785,ricoboxing,2007-09-20 17:43:00,398,"if thats 73 lbss, then i guess those kids are 5 feet tall too."
115787,Terry,2007-09-20 17:48:00,14456,"yeah, I don't think it's even 48""........but love old stories about big fish   it is a nice old photo   "
115793,SlowPoke,2007-09-20 18:06:00,2984,It's a pike
115795,jediangler,2007-09-20 18:08:00,1923,That would be lucky to weigh half that
115798,Zib,2007-09-20 18:18:00,369, Ditto
115800,nelly,2007-09-20 18:22:00,256,"Okay, I agree with everyone that the musky is nowhere close to 70+ lbs but.... here is a photo of some nice slabs from the golden years.  http://www.chippewaflowage.com/gallery/treelands/unknown3"
115820,ricoboxing,2007-09-20 18:42:00,398,  this one weighed 58 lbs
115885,John,2007-09-20 20:32:00,2956,"As the average 6 year old is around 4' tall, the math speaks for itself! I would guess that it's at least 9"" off the ground."
115931,oncogene,2007-09-20 21:52:00,154,  Not only that... it seemed the fish was held way in front of the camera while the 2 kids were more at the back.  Maybe it really was 7.2 lb? the decimal point got lost on the print/news after all these years....
116010,Rizzo,2007-09-21 01:17:00,4754,"check out the eyes on that thing, I think that may be a world record pickerel, not a slimy esox.  Either way, heck of a fish.  Not 73 lbs but I wouldn't mind tangling with it"
116019,DT10Sam,2007-09-21 01:40:00,480,"I believe the musky was 72 lbs., and I am a good authority on fish weights   after all Laurie's bass was 28lbs.    Regards, Sam"
116026,fishindevil,2007-09-21 01:50:00,6254,"Well its a nice old picture....BUT....it aint no 72lbs,.  .there is no way man,well i guess every year that past it just kept getting bigger & bigger.  ..LOL..LOL..LOL   thanks for showing us that pic   cheers"
