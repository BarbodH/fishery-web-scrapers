115804,tonyb,2007-09-20 18:30:00,1637,"I have the worst luck when looking to buy specific products in tackle shops.  I have been to 3 different local tackle shops over the past 2 days and even a Canadian Tire looking for a quality landing net for Walleye/Pike/Bass...  My criteria was a quality rubber coated, knotless mesh landing net with a 36-48"" handle.  Do you think I could find one?! NOPE Do that many people buy the crumby blue/green nylon mesh nets with flimsy handles?  Might have to stop at Basspro on the way up north, but they don't open until 9am  Oh yeah almost forgot, nobody seems to carry the Mepps Musky Marabou bucktail spinner in Orange/Black either!?  I should have known I'd be let down again by the local tackle stores.  However, it's hard to pre-order stuff that is big and bulky online like a net, and you always need last minute stuff after organizing for a fishing trip.  Frustrated... Tony"
115807,bigbuck,2007-09-20 18:35:00,2449,"Check out JBs, they have a few nice nets.They are open till 9 I believe. And they have a HUGE selection of spinnerbaits and bucktails for Muskie. It seems that Brian is catching the Muskie bug these days."
115811,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-20 18:37:00,0,"Either JB's or if they don't have them Tony, maybe try Lebarons on Dundas in Mississauga.   I think they are open till 9 tonite too."

115816,tonyb,2007-09-20 18:41:00,1637,"Thanks guys, I think I will be making some phone calls, i've done too much driving around lately looking for the stupid net"
115821,Raf,2007-09-20 18:44:00,3495,Don't forget Burns Tackle over there on Plains Rd by the Ikea Tony.
115846,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-20 19:26:00,698,I just bought a true Trax extendable from Canadian tire. I was thinking of just buying a rubberized replacment mesh and putting it on.
115849,tip-up,2007-09-20 19:30:00,94,"   TonyB, I don't see the problem here  One of your three local shops should be able to special order one in for ya no? If there is anything I ever need I can usually get it no problem at all from a few shops I frequent around here. Doesn't take that long either unless your getting a specialty item it might take a bit longer."
115859,tonyb,2007-09-20 19:45:00,1637,"Tip-up,  I can order the net online and save money too, but I didn't plan ahead, and I need it this weekend.  Just too bad out of 3 tackle stores including Burns that none of them had anything decent in terms of a landing net.  None of them carried the Mepps Musky Marabou Bucktail either, which I thought was a pretty popular musky lure...  Burns had some GrimReaper bucktails in the right colour (Black/Orange), but with Willow blades.  I prefer the Colorado blades for 'bulging' bucktails and just for there flash/vibration properties in general.  I understand the problems of cashflow and stocking everything for everybody, but these 2 items are pretty basic...And every time I go to a tackle store for something in particular they are just out, or don't carry it, it's becoming a trend.  The last time was Size 1 and 2 ball bearing swivels.  Time before that was #6 Panther Martin spinner (silver blade/yellow body) and Size 8 single hooks.  Another time they had no mono line in 6lb test, NONE!...just sad.  Tony"
115879,silvio,2007-09-20 20:13:00,433,Hey tony I am going to basspro in 45 min all check for the net and the spinners and will tell you if they have them. If they dont you save your self a trip.
115884,Uncle Buck,2007-09-20 20:30:00,1000,"Tony i've got a net like the one you're looking for...    come by and grab it... bring it back when you're done with it...  that's a 38""x30"" girth carp lying on it..."
115899,Fishnfiend,2007-09-20 20:52:00,357,Did you try Bronte Outdoors?  I bought a nice net there for pier fishing last week.  Or you could call Angling Specialties in Mississauga...
116006,silvio,2007-09-21 01:11:00,433,Tony went to bass pro they have what you need the spinners with the huge fur tale 10 bucks. as for the nets they have many rubber cotted and rubber nets.
116043,bigfish1965,2007-09-21 02:24:00,3382,I bought a big azz net from CTC and switched the nylon netting for rubberized. Much cheaper way to go.
116048,Hooked,2007-09-21 02:29:00,891,"Lebarons should at least have the net you're looking for.  I picked up a tangle-free net, 48"" extendable handle there for only $34.  Better yet, you should go to Grimsby Tackle, they typically have a good selection of quality nets and has a decent selection of musky baits too.  Give em a call:  PHONE: 905-945-0399"
116071,Mike the Pike,2007-09-21 05:01:00,3421,Yup Tony I know how you feel it seems alot of items are all stocked out this time of year.I lost my rubber net this summer when I flipped my 12 ft tinny.I had a rubber net from Lucky strike which was deep for netting a fish .There are 2 models the R-25 which you can find at almost all outdoor stores  right now is a shallow net.Then there is the R-26 which is the model I had with the 48 inch handle and is much deeper.I can net Quinte hogs with this net no problem.I can't find the R-26 anywhere.Most of the outdoor stores focus on hunting this time of year.

116085,Andy,2007-09-21 10:24:00,330,"I have purchased Loki nets from Natural Sports in Kitchener and Angling Outfitters in Woodstock. Give them a call or drop by if you are in the area. The nets are rubber coated nylon, the mesh is stuck to the mouth or frame of the net and are good value. Andy"
