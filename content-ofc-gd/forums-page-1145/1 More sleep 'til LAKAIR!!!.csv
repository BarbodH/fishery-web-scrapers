115719,tonyb,2007-09-20 13:29:00,1637,"Thanks to motv8r for holding the fundraiser auction for Tyler this past february because I won that auction for the weekend at Lakair!  I actually extended the weekend by 3 days since I have heard so many good things about the place.  That should also give me enough time to hopefully catch a Lakair grand slam (Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass, Pike, Musky and Pickerel) My wife is also hoping to catch her first Pike and/or Musky, the trick will be getting her to hold one for a photo  Anyway, keep your eyes peeled for a report sometime next week and wish us luck!  Tony"
