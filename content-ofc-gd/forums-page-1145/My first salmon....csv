Always heard there were salmon there, but never tried it out. Last night, after reading about TorontoAngler's luck last week, I decided to meet him down there for a few hours of spoon chucking. We met up around 8:30 and after about 2 hours of steady casting, I felt a definite tug on my line. I set the hook and WHAMMO we were off. He ran right taking line and then darted back and I was able to get back a lot of my line. He kept running and took a fair bit more line.  I was using a 10'6"" Medium Shimano Convergence with a Shimano Sedona 4000FB spooled up with 10 lb P-Line CXX mono and a Little Cleo glow-in-the-dark 3/4oz spoon (orange dot) tied directly using a Rapala knot. Many thanks to the folks on OFC for advice on gear. The rod and reel were recent purchases based on advice from these boards.  After a few good runs and a lot of patience (seemed like and hour but probably only a few minutes) TorontoAngler reached down with the net to scoop out the guy in the pics below.  My first ever salmon catch! After getting the treble out of both his upper and lower jaws, and a few quick snaps with the camera, I revived and released him back to the river mouth. Nice clean fish with lots of fight... he held in the water for a few minutes before giving my hand the shake and took off swimming.  <table style=""width:194px;""><tr><td align=""center"" style=""height:194px;background:url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left""><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/greenjcs/SalmonOnTheRouge?authkey=divp5A7RKpQ""><img'>http://picasaweb.google.com/greenjcs/SalmonOnTheRouge?authkey=divp5A7RKpQ""><img src=""http://lh5.google.com/greenjcs/RvIGVwowdiE/AAAAAAAABEQ/Vwf-ICAuIZM/s160-c/SalmonOnTheRouge.jpg"" width=""160"" height=""160"" style=""margin:1px 0 0 4px;""></a></td></tr><tr><td style=""text-align:center;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:11px""><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/greenjcs/SalmonOnTheRouge?authkey=divp5A7RKpQ"" style=""color:#4D4D4D;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;"">Salmon on the Rouge</a></td></tr></table>    "
115840,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-20 19:19:00,0,Congrats.  I too bought that exact rod and reel combo as you.  Hope I can break it in like that.
115841,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-20 19:19:00,698,"It was a nice Salmon, I would say ten minutes to come in. NOthing for me this time only a few bites but Mooseroos catch was more then enough excitement(I got to be the net attendant). Here's a pic of me with Moose's catch. "
115843,mooseroo,2007-09-20 19:22:00,80, I credit the catch to your advice on technique!
