The water level is extremely low and you can see bottom and far as the eye can see.   This area used to be loaded with carp which was unfishable cause of access but its all dried up.   And this sandy island wasn't there before.

That, plus the water clarity . . . .     the salmon only venture up it at night, you can see bottom everywhere where I USED TO fish!"

115995,urbanangler1990,2007-09-21 01:01:00,933,soon we dont have to fish for carp we can pick them up with our hands lol
115999,mikeymikey,2007-09-21 01:03:00,376,hmm...  more time to fish at the pier?
116000,Rizzo,2007-09-21 01:04:00,4754,you sure that's mimico?  Where are all the shopping carts and tires?
116032,Golfisher,2007-09-21 02:00:00,586, Good one!
116038,Rizzo,2007-09-21 02:11:00,4754,"I grew up in Etobicoke, fishing the humber river as a kid.  Shopping carts were considered ""structure"", I could probably pull out 2 suckers, a carp and 14 lamprey eels from behind a submerged shopping cart.  I'm just surprised to see mimico looking so clean."
