115091,solopaddler,2007-09-18 18:31:00,8605,"Thanks each and every one of you for the kind words and support, it's appreciated. Mans greatest cross to bear IMO is the knowledge that we're mortal and our time on this earth is fleeting. Immortality can be found through the eyes of your children, and that's where I find my solace. I realize that this is simply a fact of life and happens to everyone, but it's never happened to me before.... Anyhow, I've been brooding about this all morning and the conclusion I've come to is life goes on. I'll be leaving on Thursday to head up north with another good friend, hopefully catch some fish and share a few laughs. If Kareem is still able to we'll go to Picton in November for a couple days (maybe see some of you guys there). The guy is a walleye ace and lives for the late fall fishing out there. He usually keeps his boat docked at Tip Of The Bay from Oct. 'till Dec. 'cause he's there every week... Anyway I can only hope.  Thanks again,  Mike"
115092,danbo,2007-09-18 18:34:00,2646,"Lord bless Solo's friend Kareem, help him through this difficult time,Amen."
115103,FinS,2007-09-18 19:21:00,463,Mike sorry to hear the bad news our prayers are with you
115114,solopaddler,2007-09-18 20:15:00,8605,"1/2 an hour ago I get a call from Kareem, he said the doctors told him they weren't going to treat him anymore for the disease...he's too far gone. Said he's not going to worry about it, he's just going to live his life, and he now wants to head north with me on Thursday. I can't believe he's actually going, you guys have no idea how much I want this to happen. The timing of this phone call is really giving me pause after asking you guys for your thoughts and prayers, it really makes me wonder... Here's hoping I've got a great report for you guys next week...  Thanks again,  Mike"
115115,lew,2007-09-18 20:16:00,12767,So very sorry to hear about your friend Mike.  Sounds like you & Kareem shared alot of wonderful times together over the years.
115116,aniceguy,2007-09-18 20:18:00,1094,"Well Mike and I just got off the phone before I had time to read this thread he explained it all to me.  The weekend was to be a bush wacking and to a certain extent Im sure some extreme portaging to get into some big canadian shield smallie lakes and big pike lakes.  With Kareem not being able to do that it took me about 2 seconds to decide with mike that this potentially could be a last remote trip so Mike and I will be sure its one he remembers........Wait till Kareem eats the milo shore lunch... that outa get him feeling much better.  A choice between extreme fishing in the remote quebec wilderness, or a laid back weekend fishing the cottage lake with some one we know might not be there next summer....................  Im all over the laid back part..."
115118,Pigeontroller,2007-09-18 20:26:00,2793,"""Yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, and today is a gift"", Not sure who said it, but some crazy guy i worked with a few years ago told me...  Sorry for the bad news Mike, I don't pray but I am a believer in the human spirit, and the strength of it when times are bad. Have a great weekend!"

115122,John,2007-09-18 20:35:00,2956," You are absolutely right Mike, we all face our mortality in different ways. We lost a very dear friend two weeks ago after a battle with cancer. She was a religious person and dealt with it through prayer. I have faced my own mortality more times than I would wish on anyone over the past couple of years and I deal with it through the eyes of my grandchildren. I think that Kareem has made the right decision to continue to live his life and I know that you will have the opportunity to have some good times  to come.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you....  John.."
115124,dsn,2007-09-18 20:43:00,1018,"There's only one person who can perform a miracle and thats ""Jesus!"" Some might say I'm religious, some might say I'm nuts. But after the incident with my back and how he healed me the next morning. I know he can do the same for whatever the need is. I would pray for him but being there in person praying for him is alot more effective.  I do what I can in prayer on this end.  dsn"

115206,Cookslav,2007-09-19 01:24:00,1457,"I have unfortunately been through this.... My best friend died of cancer at the ripe old age of 21. Life’s just not fair sometimes plain and simple, and I definatly feel your pain. I am a religious man and I'll pray for you.  Aside from preaching, here's My best advice...  Spend time with him, talk alot, laugh alot, cry alot.... Do alot of anything you can with him, but be strong for him, and remember to listen....that’s what he'll need Be patient he's bound to be frustrated, and emotional. Aside from a miracle...At the end of the day all you can do is be his friend like you always have been.  Lean hard on your mutual friends, and your family...they are hurting too, and will be more intune with how you feel then anyone else could be.  Take care,"
114972,solopaddler,2007-09-18 12:43:00,8605,"Don't quite know what to say here except I guess it's my turn to lean on you guys.... There's 3 people in my life who would do anything for me at the drop of a hat, no  questions asked. My dad, my uncle and my friend Kareem. Kareem has been there for me through thick and thin over the last 17 years and we've spent a lot of time on the water together, he's a pretty important person to me. Two weeks ago he was fishing Nipissing with his wife when he suddenly lost the use of his right arm, he thought he had a mild stroke. As it turns out he's apparantly got 6 inoperable tumours in his brain. No previous symptoms, and the guy's only 51 years old....it's just not fair! Yesterday he had his first chemo treatment and it didn't go very well, in addition they're giving him maybe 8 weeks to live. Now this isn't a eulogy, 'cause if there's anyone who can beat the odds it's Kareem, but I'm having a bit of a hard time dealing with this. I'm not an overly religious person but I do believe in the power of positive thinking and prayer, and well, I think my buddy could use some. I'm headed up to my cabin on Thursday with Louis (aniceguy from the board) and tried to talk Kareem into joining us last night...Figured regardless of how crappy he felt and what might possibly happen it would be a good thing to do considering the circumstances...Don't think he's going to make it though unless he has a dramatic turnaround in the next 24 hours. This kind of thing just rips my guts out and if it wasn't for my family I think I'd go nuts. The last couple of days my 4 year old daughter Riley has been my focus and my lifeline... Yesterday was her very first day of school ever....big day. Here she is with mommy waiting for the school bell to ring  And standing in line with the other kids (man was she excited  )   Mike"
114973,HIMTI,2007-09-18 12:49:00,33,My prayers are with Kareem. Stay strong....be Positive.
114974,ccmtcanada,2007-09-18 12:51:00,7971,"Oh man Mike....this is terrible news.  Fifty one is far too young.  We're very sorry to hear this news.  We'll have him, as well as yourself and anyone else who knows him in our thoughts and prayers.  Your daughter is very cute...I'm sure she'll enjoy school...congrats on a big milestone!!  Cliff & Carole"

114978,pikehunter,2007-09-18 13:12:00,1659,"Sorry to hear of Kareem's condition. Like you I'm not religious but I will think of him and pray for him. I hope that it will be easy for him, you and his family. I wish a turnaround for him.  Congratulations on your daughters first day of school. I hope she enjoys it. The next 12 years will go amazingly fast for you. It seems like yesterday that my son started kindergarten, he has just started grade 12 this September. We cannot get over how fast the time has sped by us.  I can still hear my mother's words the day he first started: ""I'm glad to see him start school, neither your father or I will be around to see him go to high school."" You know what? They are both here to see him in his final year of school, I hope they are still here to see him go through college. He is their youngest grandchild, and the most spoiled of them all, but on the flipside he still goes there everyday and is a great help to my father.  Again, terribly sad to hear of your Buddie's trouble."

The thing that you have to be grateful for is that for the past  seventeen years, you have been a loyal friend to Kareem and he to you. That's already a lot. He'll have my thoughts for sure.  As for little Riley, she is starting a great journey that will make you proud all of your life. Cherish these moments as I know that that alone takes some of the stress away from thinking of Kareem.  Be well."
