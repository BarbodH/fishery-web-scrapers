299236,BassAsin,2009-01-30 00:14:00,806,"Was on the ice again today with rob,   we managed to catch 8 in total once again, i hammered 5 small pike 5 different age class of pike too hahaah he managed a half deccent bucket another jumbo about 12 inches and a small hammer.  nothin major, kept my 5 alive in a live well all day for a day total pic and then let them go. we didnt keep a fish all day.    the hole that caught 7 of 8 fish yesterday caught 6 of 8 today, somekind of structure down there that the perch pike and bass seem to like. for 3 straight days now i've been leaving one line set in about 22 feet of water about 50 yards away from my other line lookin for a big slimer to come out from the depths, and still not a hit.  I've heard somebody say that persistance pays off so we'll see!  These lawn darts varied from 13-22 inches!   "

299687,waterwolf,2009-01-31 04:22:00,556,"i'm a big fan of winter pike,,,, firm flesh..yummy!!!  matt ,, that's funny!! you are so right . one hole will produce all day when others within 6 feet get nodda.  i'm talkin' shallow ,, 6 to 8 ft. here.         6 guys ,,   2 holes per....   1 guy same bait gets 90% of the action.  just weird .   don't have an under-water camera to study why."
299689,BassAsin,2009-01-31 05:05:00,806,"An underwater camera is exactly what i need its the same depth as holes 12 feet away but i'm thinking a down log, slab rock or a weed bed of sort that they follow the edge of.  in march just before ice off i'll have to submerge a water bottle on a rope and anchor and see what it is with a mask and snorkle!"
299690,BassAsin,2009-01-31 05:05:00,806,thanks mike. nothing of great size but definatly a good day none the less!
