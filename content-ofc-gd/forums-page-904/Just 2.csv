Walters and lakers in it. by the time we got in we were fishing by 10. He lost 3 count them 3 !!! by the time It took me to drill the next set of holes. Weather was awesome for our here , a balmy sweltering 3 degrees celcius, little wind. Anyway here's the only pic I got, the first 2 through the ice and a double header at that! Came home with our dinner!!!!!! Got 3 others that swam into the depths."
