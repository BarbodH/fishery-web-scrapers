299748,limeyangler,2009-01-31 16:28:00,5204,"Hi y'all,  i've skunked the last 3 times out....so decided to go to Thunder lake just to break the run of bad luck, as it has produced lakers consistently. Turned into a party of 3 and we hit the Lake by 10:30 am.  Not before Lew got his truck buried in the ditch, lol....made a nice change to pull someone out...its usaully the other way round.....i was very proud of my little Canyon yanking that big Dodge Ram out!!!   Anyway, we set up in the same spot i had fished all ice season so far, and not long after setting up Lew iced a small one...and threw it back. I then got 2 nice ones in quick succession, both getting off right at the hole....DOH!!!!   After that we missed a couple bites...but it gradually got quieter...until there was no action at all really. We would have moved but tie was an issue as i was on-call for night shift.   Anyway....we did see some small stuff hugging the bottom in 55' FOW, i managed to hook into one...pulled it up...and there it was...a WALLEYE! ok...this lake has a lot o f nice walleye, but i tried in vain all summer to get one in this lake, then when i'm trying for trout to break the skunk...lol...i do it with my 1st Thunder Lake Walleye...sweet....not the best fishing action...but mission accomplished!      FOR ONCE IT AINT ME IN A DITCH OR BURIED TO THE BELLY IN A BEACH!           CHASED A SKUNK AWAY WITH MY 1ST THUNDER LAKE WALLEYE!  "
