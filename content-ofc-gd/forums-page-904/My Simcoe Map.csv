It has been a great map over the years and I still use it today.  I need to get it laminated.  It is funny seeing all the advertisers around the outside.  One in particular I thought was funny.  Check out the fishing shop ad. I love this map.  It is however quite large, measuring 4' by 3'. This is my old school GPS.  "
299569,Sinker,2009-01-30 23:31:00,8692,You should have that hanging on a wall somewhere. I love maps!  Sinker
299570,Terry,2009-01-30 23:34:00,14456,I have the same one kicking around somewhere
299596,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-31 00:35:00,260,Nice map.  That advertisement is priceless
299599,Fisherman,2009-01-31 00:49:00,7201,"I got one of those about 20 years ago from the bait shop in the little plaza in Gilford, maybe see if you can photocopy it in sections and laminate them or put them in the soft document protectors."
299601,Cudz,2009-01-31 00:54:00,2652,Yeah I have got to figure something out.  I hae taed all the creases and I don't want it to fall apart.  I like the photocopy section and use protectors and a binder.  It is a great map and I don't want to lose it.
299820,bbog,2009-01-31 22:33:00,665,Have you considered taking a picture of it with a digital camera? Then you could use photo editing software to produce the sections you want. End result is a digital copy that lasts forever.
299821,johnnyb,2009-01-31 22:36:00,3413,Love the old bait shop ad   I called it just for fun...obviously not them anymore
299871,fishindevil,2009-02-01 00:24:00,6254,"I love maps too,have probly 50 or more of them for lakes all over southern & central ontario,and i have had some for well over 20yrs !!!! when we had to do it old school long before the days of GPS !!!! i still like looking at them,and still once & a while find new spots using them & studying themi have a few in frames,like my government charts of the upper ottawa river & haliburton region showing all the lakes & canoe routes !!!! i think if you lightly use an iron & waxed paper you can get most of the creases out and it puts a protective coating on it to protect it !!! thanks for sharing....cheers"

299911,diggyj,2009-02-01 01:57:00,548,"Here is a pic of my OLD SCHOOL Lake Simcoe map. I remember purchasing this map with my brother the first time we fished in our annual University of Toronto Fraternity Pike Tournament. Brings back lots of memories of him and I winning first fish and biggest fish over the years. Miss you bro, RIP.  "
