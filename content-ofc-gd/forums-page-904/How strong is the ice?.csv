300080,kickingfrog,2009-02-01 14:43:00,8333,Wonder how thick the ice was? Great structure if it had gone through
300211,Bernie,2009-02-01 21:51:00,3190,"I hauled this across the lake on 16"" of blue ice. The boathouse is 18'X24'. "
300214,kickingfrog,2009-02-01 22:01:00,8333," Bet it didn't cost you $40,000 US Bernie."
300217,Leecher,2009-02-01 22:04:00,7832,Kudos to all involved     that house is a piece of history that needed to be saved and real glad she made the journey across the bay...... Simply amazing  Thanks for sharing Spiel
300224,irishfield,2009-02-01 22:12:00,26272, Probably 2 feet... like it says in the first paragraph!
300225,Sinker,2009-02-01 22:13:00,8692,Ice is a lot stronger than most people think!!!
300226,kickingfrog,2009-02-01 22:17:00,8333,"Figures, I'm soothing a 4 week old, making chilli, appetizers, watching 2 channels simultaneously (HD PVR Plus rules) and surfing the web."
300266,fishindevil,2009-02-01 23:53:00,6254,Thats pretty amazing !!!!...job well done
300299,Joey,2009-02-02 00:39:00,9122,"Wow, great video Chris.  I'd have been a litle anxious too.  Joey"
300307,Bernie,2009-02-02 00:55:00,3190,"No it didn't . But it saved me $30,000!"
300465,Spiel,2009-02-02 14:04:00,9065,"I remember that ""big move"" Bernie.  Ice is indeed very strong and of course it's buoyant. I remember an ole hut operator on Simcoe telling me (years ago) that the ice at 30 odd inches one year could support trains if'n they wanted to lay the tracks."
300528,LeXXington,2009-02-02 16:11:00,1928,That was cool..  2 feet of ice now that would need a gas auger
