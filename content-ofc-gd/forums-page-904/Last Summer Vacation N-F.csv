Well we did make the trip, loaded up the old Ford and headed south. Not a problem all the way there and back, the old box on wheels performed fantastically!  We took our time going down with one night stopover. We didn't have a motel/hotel booked and I'm glad we didn't as we ended up in a nice smaller beach front motel with the pool right outside our door and the beach a few steps away, perfect.  Didn't get any fishing done, talked a lot about it though. Played a few games of golf, (we are all novices BTW) and a game of mini put. Spent lots of time relaxing and enjoying the water and sand.  Found a good deal on salt water fishing gear at a couple of nearby flee markets but that wasn't until the last couple of days that we were there. At the Myrtle Beach Indoor flea Market you could give a $25 deposit and return the gear at weeks end, if you decided to buy the pole and reel combo you just forfeited the dough, if you should decide to give it back then it would cost only $10 for the rental. Wish I had known that on my first day and not the second to last! A bargain and a half!  Hope you enjoy the pictures, this is only a few of the 200 or so that were taken! Harry   I just had to get my picture taken with this sign! Couldn't resist it, with a name like that it just had to be a great place to eat!  Some of you that have driven I95 may know this place.    The nightly fireworks show was a treat, what better can it be?  A beer, pool, nice and warm water and night air.          Right out the door and into the pool.    Baby stingray caught on the State Park Pier which was quickly unhooked and shown to the kids by the park ranger.                    Pikehunter Jr and I couldn't resist striking up a conversation with a girl surf fishing, my wife wasn't too pleased though...  The moon......and the sun    Myrels Inlet      JR was pretty pleased with himself doing 90% of the driving on the way back home."
