300018,FishHeadRic,2009-02-01 06:51:00,226,"Man, It's been a cold winter this year eh? Haven't been able to get out on the water too much so I've been keeping busy in the Man-cave re-building the lure stocks. Doing mostly poppers so far but I decided to give a frog a try as well and I think I got it down pretty good.    Gotta get some better shots of this one. Gave it away and only got to snap a few pics the other day when I went to my buddys house.    Going over there tommorow so l'll try to get some better shots.    Here's some pics of one of the other ones I did. These pics came out a lot better.      Close up of the eye.    Good ole laundry bag scale pattern.    This one came out great. Swims and Pops like a champ!  And the latest one I did was a Fresh water Bass lure. Inspiration for one of the other Canucks on one of the boards I've been posting on down here, Etch-a-sketch. Do any of you guys know who he is or have any of his lures?    Leopard Frog with spinners for feet.        Snag, l've got a few more in the works with your name on 'em. Just a few more weeks.  Enjoy   !!! FishHeadRic"
300020,SlowPoke,2009-02-01 06:55:00,2984,Looking good! I've been working on a few myself. Great way to pass the time. -Brian
300035,Spiel,2009-02-01 11:34:00,9065,....Top shelf Ric. No doubt in my mind as to their effectiveness.
300036,outllaw,2009-02-01 11:35:00,1232,good stuff. etch a sketch is a great secret hidden in the toronto area.. his big bully frogs are simply awesome. i have several of his works of art. those baits you made will work quite well.
300048,medmart,2009-02-01 12:42:00,587,Great job man love the colors on the poppers  Rob
300063,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 13:35:00,8163,"Excellent craftmanship Ric!!!  Those lures a very purdy, and I'm sure the fish will love them!  I enjoy lurecraft as well, it gets the creative juices flowing!!!"
300065,lew,2009-02-01 13:58:00,12767,"Excellent job Ric, that's pretty impressive work !!  They appear to have a thru-wire set-up, so how did you attach the belly hook hanger ??  Is it all one piece of wire, and if so, I'm assuming you cut the lure in 1/2 and bent the wire down thru the bottom then glued the pieces back together ??  If it's a trade secret, I'll understand"
300148,FishHeadRic,2009-02-01 18:24:00,226,"Hey Guys, thanks for all the complimnts. Outlaw, if l'm not mistaken Etch is from Brampton. If any of you guys ever get a chance to see or aquire one of his lures l highly suggest it. He does some amazing stuff. Lew, they are all thru-wired. The hook hangers are actually 180lb sporo swivels. I'm drilling the hole and passing the swivel thru one of the ends. It's a nice and neat set up with a belly grommit to finish it off.   FHR"
300154,lew,2009-02-01 19:08:00,12767," Thanks Ric, that's a great idea !!"
300256,motv8tr,2009-02-01 23:23:00,2587,"wow Rick, those look GREAT!!!  I'll look forward to hearing about all the fish you catch with them  Maureen"
300270,fishindevil,2009-02-01 23:58:00,6254,"Great looking lures rick !!! im sure they will work very well,those poppers look amazing,i also make my own worm harnesses & walleye spinners too,its a great feeling when you start catching fish on the lures that you made & designed !!!....cheers"
300326,snag,2009-02-02 02:03:00,1932," No rush here Ricola,  Not like I can do much with anything till soft h20 appears!  I await with baited breath (been dying to drop that line!)  "
300344,Bernie,2009-02-02 02:31:00,3190,Well done stuff Ric ! That frog would be deadly on Nipissing.
300517,bicephalic,2009-02-02 15:38:00,112,Hey that's good stuff!
