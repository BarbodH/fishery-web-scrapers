299785,tonyle87,2009-01-31 19:41:00,26,B.J Penn by way of tombstone piledriver
299789,Cudz,2009-01-31 20:16:00,2652,you are correct.
299791,Jigger,2009-01-31 20:28:00,1237,"The only way GSP gets a sub is if BJ gasses and can't control the pace any longer. Look what happened in the Hughes fight. He was stopped on strikes, but Hughes could just have easily put BJ in a kimura from the crucifix. Getting pumped!!!"
299833,Twocoda,2009-01-31 23:14:00,4130,honestly ...i know this is against the grain but .......ill take Penn....the boy is on a mission not to be dnied...GSP better have his best game plan in effect....the only way GSP is going to possibly win is if Penn Gasses out...and i dont think that is going to happen....  Having said that ...i am canadian and my heart wants GSP to win ...but my head says Penn split decision ( that is correct ...i do believe his cardio will go the distance  Regardless it is going to be a great fight
299992,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 05:42:00,1800, Just thought I'd point out that I called that... perfectly
300005,Mark Kulik,2009-02-01 06:20:00,348,Quote  GSP's relentless attack will wear Penn down-GSP 4th round Ground and pound stoppage. looks we both called it Steve!
300010,Cudz,2009-02-01 06:29:00,2652,I was completely wrong and I am glad.  War GSP
299529,tonka-toy,2009-01-30 21:13:00,139,"Should be one hell of a fight,who's your pick?"
299531,jediangler,2009-01-30 21:15:00,1923,GSP in the 2nd by submission.
299532,muskeybugged,2009-01-30 21:19:00,282,GPS I mean GSP...... Penn is always out of shape at 170.  TKO 3rd round GnP.
299533,Terry,2009-01-30 21:20:00,14456,GSP
299534,Grimace,2009-01-30 21:22:00,2020,GSP.    Knockout 2nd
299535,Bitsmith2k,2009-01-30 21:25:00,396,"gsp, decision"
299536,Abberz,2009-01-30 21:25:00,140,GSP with a knock-out blow to the larynx in the 3rd round.....ultimately shutting Penn up for a few weeks if not forever!  LETS GO GSP!
299538,tonka-toy,2009-01-30 21:29:00,139,"I think all the trash-talk will blow up in Penn's face.I don't think guys should get GSP more fired up.I say GSP late in the 2nd,ground and pound.I also like silva and guida to win."
299539,BillM,2009-01-30 21:30:00,17367,":eeek:  I don't want either guy to get hurt, but I'd like to see GSP win by KO or submission.  BJ has been talking alot of smack, I hope he can back it up."
299541,misfish,2009-01-30 21:34:00,29133,"If Penn can keep from gasing out,it,s going to be the fight that will be remembered.Two great fighters. If it goes 5,it,s a toss up.  Penn seems to get away from having his face open up.This fight,he wont look so pretty when it,s over."
299543,Bitsmith2k,2009-01-30 21:44:00,396, his skin is like shark skin..
299547,diggyj,2009-01-30 22:02:00,548,GSP...Split decision
299551,Jigger,2009-01-30 22:26:00,1237,"The thing is, BJ has such a good chin and no chance is he getting subbed by GSP. I also think BJ is more elusive on the feet and has heavier hands. GSP has him as an all around fighter, cardio and wrestling. I really hope GSP takes it, but you can never count BJ out. Especially if hes got a chip on his shoulder."
299560,tonka-toy,2009-01-30 23:11:00,139,"Even with his ""heaver hands"",and George fighting with one eye(thanks to Penn's accidental thumb in the eye),Penn couldn't take him out last time.I hope it stays clean and we get to see who the pound for pound best is .I'm not sure Penn has the superior hands. George has been so dominent on the ground lately, people forget how good a striker he is."
299573,Jigger,2009-01-30 23:44:00,1237,"Two things that GSP really needs to watch out for are BJs knee when going for a takedown and the uppercut in close. BJ is so talented and IMO is very focused on this fight which makes him one of the most dangerous guys out there. If you think hes going to be scared to exchange with Georges, you're dreaming. His boxing is sick and I think hes got the edge in the early rounds. If GSP can get it to RDS 3...4...5 his conditioning will pretty much hand him the fight. This is such an even fight, it can go either way. Personally, I think it should have been a catch weight with no title up for grabs. Both guys are in their prime and this is a fight of a lifetime. I'm really exited for this event!"
299574,TJQ,2009-01-30 23:46:00,7806, ditto...
299575,Leecher,2009-01-30 23:48:00,7832,St-pierre hands down.... the guy is warrior
299580,wee scot,2009-01-30 23:56:00,75,gsp without a doubt
299585,Burtess,2009-01-31 00:09:00,901,"Like most I very much want GSP to win, but......  Penn has some very good head movement when boxing, he rarely gets hit, and has a good chin. Problem is he really is a brutally dominant lightweight, and his frame doesn't take to 170lbs as well as St. Pierre.  I also think (now this is from the propaganda that has been televised) that Penn wants this fight more than GSP (let the barrage of comments begin lol).  I think that it will be Penn in the third, by rear naked choke.....  Burt"
299600,Mark Kulik,2009-01-31 00:52:00,348,GSP's relentless attack will wear Penn down-GSP 4th round Ground and pound stoppage.
299613,PatrickGG,2009-01-31 01:22:00,562,"GSP for the win, First round roughly around the first minute mark."
299634,bucktail,2009-01-31 02:08:00,1857,GSP second round stoppage due to blows
299645,Cudz,2009-01-31 02:32:00,2652,"I want GSP to win but... I would have to say Penn is the better boxer (faster hands for sure).  Penn is crazy dangerous on the ground even in the guard.  Penn has a great chin.  If he is fit, I am going to say Penn in the 3rd.  If he is not fit I am going to say it goes 5 rounds and GSP will win the decision because he will be able to take down Penn and score points that way. It looked to me like GSP overtrained for his last fight with Fitch.  He did dominate that fight but he gassed part way through and that was a 3 round affair.  I really do hope GSP wins but I am not betting on it.  Either way, both these guys are warriors and always put on a good show."
299756,steverowbotham,2009-01-31 17:08:00,1800,"GSP WILL NOT WIN BY SUBMISSION  I just wanted to say that.  BJ Penn is one of the most accomplished BJJ practitioners in the sport, he will not be submitted by GSP.  That being said, GSP by TKO in Round 4"
299767,steverowbotham,2009-01-31 18:03:00,1800, The Fitch fight was 5 rounds.
