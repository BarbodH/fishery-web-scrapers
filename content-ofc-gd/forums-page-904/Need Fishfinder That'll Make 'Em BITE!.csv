Happy to hear Cliff likes his new toy. I know the previous owner looked after it well  At least you had good company, and the fish will still be there for next time."

300294,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-02 00:32:00,1183,Nice that you finally got to use your new 'toy' and that it works too.      We should be getting many more reports from ya     ....don't forget your camera.
300564,kingofthesteelhead,2009-02-02 17:26:00,140,Maybe you guys should try sleeping in and do the afternoon bite at that particular lake.My nephew does well there most afternoons from 300 til dark. I was out near crappieperchunter on Saturday. I did not walk out as far as that was the worst walk out this year.
