276648,Clampet,2008-12-07 13:09:00,1947,I packed the sleigh and I'm a headin' her out! 
276664,Clampet,2008-12-07 14:10:00,1947,"Well I got back, and placed 6th. I caught 4 Perch, and another one of those Roach's. They really got the sound effects down perty good, what with the coughing, spitting, and rubbing of the hands together.  If you do not get any bites fer a bit, the character actually starts yawning!  Also you can hear crows, and the realistic sound of the wind blowing. I also noticed, that if you change spots a lot, and have yer character cover a lot of distance by prolonged running, he tires out and slows to a walk!  I was fishing a river system, and discovered this."
276666,Billy - Curtiss,2008-12-07 14:31:00,241,"Nice! I'm in the midst of downloading this right now. Sounds like fun. Mind you, I already waste a truckload of time on my current obsession....playing Fish Wrangler on Facebook!"
276683,tributaryhunter,2008-12-07 15:41:00,108,"it's something to do until the real thing happens, played an hour tourney on some huge bay  and got 51dink perch 30 ruffe 2 pike 10 roach and 1 zander, it awsome how they came out with this for this year, exspecially the realistic sounds except gas lol cheers."
276690,Billy - Curtiss,2008-12-07 16:17:00,241,"Is it just me, or does this thing load ridiculously slow? I don't get it...my computer is normally really fast."
299880,dsn,2009-02-01 00:57:00,1018,"Cool game when your stuck indoors. Caught a ton of fish. Perch, Bream, Ruff, Rudd, 1 white fish, few Artic Graylings. No pike yet or laker.  Its great cause you can even adjust the sensitivity of the rod tip.  DSN"
