Managed a nice Laker in the 5lbs range after about 20mins. Then it died right down. Ive been working on a new laker jig so I decided to give it a test run, and what do you know picked up a 3-4lber in the first 10min! Although the jig did get a bit mangled so I'll have to work out the bugs, I think this could be one awesome laker jig! The action died right down and after that with the finder going blank. Time to move. We headed out to 100fow and set up camp. Before the fella's could get there line down I had a fish on. Scrappy fish in the 5lbs range. Next Dan was up with a beauty that went about 8lbs. Then I picked up another just over 5lbs on a spoon. Once the weather changed the fish died off completely so we packed it in. I went 5-7 and Dan went 1-3 well the other fella's came up empty. here's a few pics from the day, got too cold and windy for the poor fish. Not bad for a slow day on the lake.   tightlines  Ryan Hare     same fish different angle "
