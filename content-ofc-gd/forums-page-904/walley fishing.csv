299202,uglyfish,2009-01-29 22:45:00,981,"Fish the typical spots, rocks,weeds, humps. Vary depth and presentation. Light doesn't play as big a role in winter as ice and snow cover limit light penetration. Live bait is always good to have on hand."
299261,lovetofish,2009-01-30 00:59:00,500,"thanks, was thinking of a weed bed at the mouth of a river"
299357,Marc Thorpe,2009-01-30 10:59:00,621,"Dont be shy of running short line cranks over weed tops,run one flat line with a shallow running bait Good indication to higher activity periods is when the water reaches 60 degrees and start rising First emergent weeds till they reach the surface seems to be prime time for shallows eyes Especially first warming trend in May"

299720,Radnine,2009-01-31 13:45:00,1538,"I purchased a book at Canadian Tire (The Freshwater Angler Series, Successful Walleye Fishing) and it's really quite good. I think that I learned some things reading it (I won't know until I try them). There is a really good section on where to find Walleye, what structure to look for, wind direction, light conditions etc. Jim"
