300058,sleded,2009-02-01 13:13:00,96,"Well got a phone call fri night from my uncle and he wanted to head down and try some crappie fishing with his wife to be and a few of this buddies. Well the day started off good a lot of bites but i only landed one crappie in the moring but my uncle and his womean caught about 10. The bite started to get very light in the afternoon so we cut the tail off the minnow and then we started getting more fish.  Late afternoon my brother came out and he caught his first crappie and now he loves to ice fish about time ha ha ha.  We ended up the whole group getting about 17 crappies for shore lunch!!! The new hut worked really good just have to get some heat in her for next time , cant wait to try it out again!!               "
