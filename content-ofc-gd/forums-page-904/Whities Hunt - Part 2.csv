299952,Leecher,2009-02-01 02:56:00,7832,"Got up this morning at 6:00am, looked outside the kitchen window and this is what greeted me    -18C with clear skies, not too bad but winds from the Ouest @ 20Km We left home at 7:00am like usual and the plan was to meet Steve aka trout&muskyhunter, Kevin aka fishing 24/7 and his girl friend Stephanie.    Met them at the end of highway 5 and proceeded to our destination.  Arrived around 9:00am and got setup..... the snow that had fallen from the last storm created a lot of slush holes between the ice and snow and made for a difficult walk.  Wanted to target the same area as last time.  Started jigging a Foxee tipped with a white Gulp fish fry and I hear FISH ON coming from my left.... It was Stephanie that had just hooked into a fish.  The battle lasted for a couple of minutes until it surfaced.   She hooked into her first laker and a beautiful one but being OOS, back she went in a hurry  After a little while without any action we decided to move to another area, closer to where the vehicles were parked.  Got setup again and what do you know..... I get a hit & miss then not long after Steve gets a hit & miss  That was around noon..... the guys were hungry and headed for the cars for a bite to eat, meanwhile I stayed on my position thinking that the miss hit would come back..... it was just a dream LOL  We decided at that point to move to another area, on the south end of the lake, got setup, and not soon that my Foxee hit bottom I get a hit.... here is the results    I was on top of a weed bed and the perch was on fire Managed to catch 4 in the spawn of a minute and a half..... took a pic of the biggest, here it is    My jig just could not reach bottom that the perch would jump all over it but since we were after whities that little action did not last long.... we moved to another area again  Got to our new destination and dropped the jigs down the holes and what do you know..... I hear FISH ON and again Stephanie hooked into her second fish but this time it got away and we did not see it.  She did hook into another one and this time she landed a big beautiful laker.... took a pic while she was fighting it    WTG Stephanie what a real nice fish     Back she went in a hurry There was a lot of hit & miss after that and did not land any.  Paul and Kevin tried hard to drill different holes around the area but just could not entice them to take our offerings.  At around 3:45pm Kevin, Stephanie and Steve decided to leave but Paul and I had different plans. We headed for our final destination, the spot, the first time we set foot on this lake last weekend.  Did not produce anything except for me getting almost a heart attack when jigging and feeling resistance on my line, only to see that I had snagged a long skinny tree branch that I was able to land on ice LOL  My PB LOL  All in all, we fished hard for 7 hours, landed 2 lakers and 4 perch Congratulations to Stephanie for landing those beautiful lakers     WTG Girl It's too bad they were out of season cause that would of made good table fare  Thanks Steve for joining us, I had a super time.... will have to do it again. Last but not least.... Thanks Paul and Kevin..... where are we going next? Oops... oh yeah... tomorrow eyes!! Hope you enjoy! Jacques"

300193,limeyangler,2009-02-01 21:16:00,5204,"Having been skunked almost religiously the last three outings before I FIND THIS POST HIGHLY INSULTING....HOW DARE YOU USE THE NAME OF THE SKUNK IN VAIN!!!!!!!!    Top stuff Jacques. Do ya think the ones that were getting off were whities?   You must be using those barbless hooks they've been selling me up here too.....lol.    Great report as per usual....very impressed with the PB branch too, not easy to get snagged on the ice....even more impressive to land the snag   Cheers   Simon"
300208,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-01 21:44:00,2050,:spam:  How much is Rona paying you for this Jacques?!? lol  Thanks for the report mon ami!  i have to get out for something other than gobies with the little one...  cheers ryan
300233,Leecher,2009-02-01 22:32:00,7832," LOL Simon..... I know how the lakers hit.... real hard thump but the hit & miss were more like it was trying to hit the fish fry instead of the hole jig... I'm sure it was whities but    LOL Yeah that branch almost gave me a heart attack until I saw it surfaced..... that thing was massive and long    60"" LOL  Will give it another try soon cause I get the feeling that the smell will get washed away next time  Thanks again!   Hahaha!!!! They don't pay me enough LOL Thanks Ryan!"
300244,BassAsin,2009-02-01 22:54:00,806,"dont tell me you work at RONA as well! hahah actually i am no longer there, Ripping Of the Northern Area we always said hahaah   great report Jaques good to hear all had some fun and as for walking in slush, sounds about as fun as eating glass, we've been lucky here and the lakes are holdin tough, how big was that perch? 10 11""?  looks like good table fare too, when do the lakers open?  good luck with the eyes too!  Matt!"
300300,Leecher,2009-02-02 00:41:00,7832," LOL!! Thanks Matt... The Rona thing, yeah my favorite store to spend $100.00 dollars in half an hour for sure LOL and for the record, don't work there LOL The slush was inevitable..... the weight of the snow caused it.... certain areas of the lake didn't have any but for the most part, where we drilled holes last weekend was worst  The perch was about 10"" -  11"" and had a big belly on her     Should of stayed there a little longer but wasn't the targetted species.  As for the lakers, they open in the spring, in April.... those are native trout and are the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.... real dark and full of spunk LOL.... can't wait for the season to open.  Thanks again!!"
300356,Leecher,2009-02-02 03:00:00,7832," Thanks Joco.... they sure are difficult to catch    We'll definitely try again to entice them but those lakers seemed to jump on our jigs everywhere we punched holes     and too bad their OOS  Weather wise was cold on Saturday and today did not go out as planned..... was a beauty day, should of gone out"
300487,Greencoachdog,2009-02-02 14:54:00,8163,Nice report and pics Jacques!!!  Man!... that looks cold!!!     You need to be a little more careful about putting your fingers in those Perches mouths like that!!!... that thing could've taken the end of your thumb off if he really wanted to!!!
300614,Leecher,2009-02-02 20:56:00,7832, Thanks Glen.... It sure was bitter cold that morning with the winds blowing at 20Km but was nice and cozy in the afternoon.  LOL I'll try and be extra careful next time I'm handling one     Thank for the heads up LOL
