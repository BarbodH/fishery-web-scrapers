298291,fishnsled,2009-01-27 22:56:00,3520,"Good friends, good times, and a few fish to boot.  Sounds like a great weekend to me even if the weather was a bit chilly.  Great report Joey!    Thanks"
298296,Leecher,2009-01-27 23:26:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey  Some real fine eyes you guys got into.... congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
298322,Bly,2009-01-28 00:44:00,1556,Great report Joey!  I had to laugh though........You know you are Canadian when you head NORTH in the winter for a getaway.
298344,Joey,2009-01-28 01:40:00,9122,  Take off eh!!!  
298348,Bernie,2009-01-28 01:49:00,3190,Hiya Joey. Looks like a beautiful spot to visit ! And fish too! Glad to see you caught some. Did you leave Wayne up there? He said he was going to stop by here on his way home today.
298350,Joey,2009-01-28 01:54:00,9122," Yes Bernie, they were staying up til today to see the neighbour that said they were coming up on Tuesday. I think they said they were leaving tonight.  Joey"
298352,Bernie,2009-01-28 01:57:00,3190,"OK, thanks Joey."
298360,Jessy F,2009-01-28 02:27:00,3,Great Report Joey!!  Sounds like you guys had a great time!  JohnnyB and I had the pleasure of experiencing a day and night at Wayne's and it was great!  The Chinese Restaurant is well known all over for there fantastic food too
298361,Rich Clemens,2009-01-28 02:29:00,3131,Lookin' Good Folks.
298375,Ron,2009-01-28 03:00:00,1683,"JOEY!!!  Shhh, there are no fish in Temagami. Didn't you know that!  Nice to see pictures of Wayne and Leah's Chalet, unfortunately this will be the only way I will see it this year. Looks like you had a great time up there, no doubt with hosts like Leah.... I guess that goes for Wayne too.  Wayne, you're into those Fruit Loops eh? ha ha ha"
298458,Spiel,2009-01-28 12:48:00,9065,....Nice stuff guys and gals. I'm still trying to wrap my head around that walleye coming out of 90 f.o.w.
298477,bigugli,2009-01-28 13:37:00,6138,"Good friends, great scenery and fish to boot.  What more can you ask from a trip report. You folks had fun.  Thanx for sharing"
298481,John the Fisherman,2009-01-28 13:46:00,45,"Umm... Bigbuck. Sorry, and not discounting your buddy's dad on his stories of catching fish here back in the 60's, but there are, and never where any muskie in Temag.  Nice pike and walleye for sure, but no Muskie.  I would not want you to fish here expecting to catch the cousin of a pike, and just catch pike.  The closest lake around here for muskie would be Nippissing and the French River.  JTF"
298631,johnnyb,2009-01-28 20:41:00,3413,"I was wondering if someone was going to mention that...but talking about fishing on Temagami can get a guy so excited that all kinds of stuff just starts coming out    Still waiting on the pics of the LING, Wayne...."
298856,irishfield,2009-01-29 04:11:00,26272, Well... it was actually 71.8FOW.. but who's counting! lol  I figured Paul had a Whitey off bottom.. but no a pickeral and the other two from the same depth. Thankfully all three below the slot size as they was pretty much DOA !   ..and as John the Fisherman pointed out for Bigbuck.. even though the MNR was nice enough to always post a Musky season for Div 26 (Lake Temagami) there are absolutely none in the body of water.  I'll get your pictures up sometime tomorrow Joey!! Thanks for the call tonight wondering about us. Neighbour talked us into staying another day and we went out fishing this morning... add Whitefish to the weekend count !
298857,Joey,2009-01-29 04:16:00,9122,"Super Wayne, I'm glad you two are home and safe.  Now bring on the pics tomorrow.  I'd Like to see your whitie and the ling I caught  Joey"
298899,Spiel,2009-01-29 11:51:00,9065, ....Even at 71.8 FOW Wayne I'm still somewhat surprised!    Is it tomorrow yet?
299115,ScugogBoy,2009-01-29 19:18:00,36,"Joey....sounds like a relaxing weekend. Seems this Irishfield is a generous and gracious host......hope to meet him one day if I'm lucky and share a ""fishing experience"". Did you end up keeping the ling? I've heard of Europeans actually targeting ling on Ontario Lakes.....yes they are slimy and gross looking........but I hear that they are totally ""delicious""...like a freshwater Cod comparison..... Wayne said that the walley were DOA....I take it because they came from such a deep depth......bet they tasted fantastic....Enjoyed reading this post tremendously....Thanks."
299118,Joey,2009-01-29 19:30:00,9122," Scucogboy, we didn't keep the ling as I hear they are very hard to clean, but Leah said they have a ""ling fling"" in Temagami each year and they are considered a delicacy.  Maybe next time I'll give it a try.  Joey"
298140,jwl,2009-01-27 15:57:00,1056,"sounds like a great adventure, and some decent fish caught along the way to boot.   Funny on the comments about the chinese food place, I actually ate there before as well,work brought me up that way, had to work at the Foodland(not sure if name changed now) I installed thier debit card system, rolled into town just as they where rolling up the sidewalks   Checked into the Temagami Inn,went out to find some grub, the chinese place was the only place open to get some food they even stayed open late to accomodate me and my wife   ...not even the Busy Bee across the road if we wanted chips and pop for dinner was open  As for cold..well it was a few years back in May when I went there and everything was still frozen solid  Thanks for sharing the report"
298174,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-27 17:23:00,1362,"Great report Joey and very nice pics!!  ....ya know what they say about a guy that eats fruit loops??......Never mind, I won't even go there Wayne"
