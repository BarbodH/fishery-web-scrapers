299757,Beans,2009-01-31 17:11:00,3339,Anybody got any recent info...ice conditions? snow depth? lure choices?  Small group of OFNers heading up early tomorrow...targetting crappie mostly...
299770,TerryC,2009-01-31 18:11:00,196,"I was up there last week, Ice on Brooks bay was 12-14 in, Very easy to walk out if you follow the snowmobile trails from Forest Glen, there has been a bit of snow since I was up but I imagine it's still in good shape. Most of the Crappies are being caught suspended in 22 to 26 feet of water. Grab some minnows at Stone's (Hwy 28) and you shoud be in Buisness.  There is alot of pressure there on the weekends, so if I ways heading up I would try to get on for the early bite or hang around until dusk.  Good Luck Clarence"
