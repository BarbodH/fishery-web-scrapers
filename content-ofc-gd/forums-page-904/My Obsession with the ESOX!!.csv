My old man catching the infamous ESOX!!   I can't remember where he said this was... I think he said ""Clear Lake""? Not too sure where that is (if anyone can google map this, that'd be awesome!)...oh, he was also quick to remind me this was in his early 30's! I told my dad... don't worry... I'm catching up!  hahaha... now you all know how this crazy obsession started!  Here the pics...      After looking at the size of these little ones, its the ONE THING I hope to NOT BE LIKE when it comes to my DAD!! (Hahaha, I doubt my dad will ever read/find this on the internet... he has problems using a typewriter sometimes! NO JOKE!! Hahaha... LOVE YOU POPS!!)"
