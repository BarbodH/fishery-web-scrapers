300245,Big Cliff,2009-02-01 22:56:00,6899,"Well, Beans, Photoz, and I headed off to the beautiful lake X bright and early this morning. I took one look at the road access and decided thet even with 4WD, I wasn't going to try driving out onto the lake so we loaded up our toboggans and started walking. There was a sled/ATV trail and that wasn't too bad for walking but to get where we wanted to fish, we had to leave the trail; as Steve said in an other thread, snow and slush didn't make the walking very pleasent for us older fellows. Fortunatly, we didn't have to go too far off the trail and we shoveled away some snow and drilled our holes.  Even though the temperature was milder than it has been for quite a while, the breeze soon picked up and made it feel a lot colder than it really was, none the less we had come to fish and fish we did.  This was my first experience using a Vexilar and Steve was wonderful at showing me how to set it up and understand what I was seeing. I have to say I am impressed! Shortly after getting set up I saw something come into range suspended at about 12' (we were fishing in 28FOW), I quickly reeled up to slightly above it and watched as it rose up to my bait. I didn't even feel a bite, just lifted my bait, felt some weight, and set the hook. That was my one and only fish of the day but without the Vexilar, I wouldn't heve even known there was a fish in the area. I did mark a lot more fish but by now the cooler air seemed to be moving in and the fish refused to hit anything we presented.  Anyway, a special thanks to Steve for giving me such a wonderful deal on the unit, it looks like it had never been used, and for showing me how to use it.  Here are a few photos of the day.  Beans and Steve chatting and watching their lines. Notice how grey the sky is!   Steve with his new FL20, Nice unit!   I have no idea what Beans was going on about here LOL.   And finally, my one and only fish of the day!   The catching was slow but the Fishing, as always was wonderful!"

300257,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-01 23:26:00,260,Looks like a good time was had for sure  That sure is a slushy mess...good call leaving the vehicle on shore.  I was on Scugog yesterday in similar slushy conditions and watched someone attempt to take out a Dodge pickup truck.  Was entertaining!  Thanks for the pics and the report  Lake X must be far away if you were up that early
300259,motv8tr,2009-02-01 23:28:00,2587,Glad you guys had a good day even if the fish were shy about playing  Maureen
300268,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-01 23:56:00,2038,I know where Lake x is....

300273,Joey,2009-02-02 00:08:00,9122,"Great report Cliff.  At least you got a fish.  We were out in that slush today also and it was a mess, and all we managed was a small perch - And Paul caught it     I don't know, I think he has this ice fishing thing figured out  Looks like you all had a nice day.  I've wondered if those Vexular's are worth it.  Maybe I should reconsider.  Joey"
300281,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-02 00:20:00,1183,So that's what that Steve guy looks like.  3 young fellas out having fun with toboggans Great that you got a fish....you'll no doubt be going out more - hopefully.  I too was on the river....took the dog for a walk....slushy it was...but it was nice being out there just the same.  Enjoyed your report Cliff.
300320,Leecher,2009-02-02 02:00:00,7832,Great report and pics Cliff Electronic flashers sure is the way to go as far as ice fishing goes.... great tool to locate depth and fish  Glad you guys had a good time and that you caught a beautiful slab Thanks for sharing Leechman
300328,darsky,2009-02-02 02:05:00,586,Lake X must have been plan B for Beans because he was here yesterday asking for conditions on Jacks. Lake X......funny.
300470,John,2009-02-02 14:17:00,2956,"Looks like you had a nice day regardless of the catching Cliff, good company too."
300507,Beans,2009-02-02 15:29:00,3339,"I have no idea what Beans was going on about here LOL.   Actually I was asking the Fishing Gods ""Where in the Hell is my fish?""..."
300521,irishfield,2009-02-02 15:50:00,26272, Yah... but that was the intentional diversionary tactic Darky!  
300531,ccmtcanada,2009-02-02 16:16:00,7971,"Beans is saying ""I once caught a fish thiiiiiiiis big"".  Great report Cliff...always fun when mini get togethers happen!"
