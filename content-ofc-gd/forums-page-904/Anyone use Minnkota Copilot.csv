300079,bigb,2009-02-01 14:41:00,5,I use my Terrova to do alot of my slow trolling on Lake Erie. I am thinking of getting the copilot so I can keep the footpad up front out of the way. Anybody have any experience using the copilot good or bad?

300114,John,2009-02-01 16:30:00,2956,I can't comment on the MinnKota but I have the MotorGuide version and I wouldn't be without it.  I do however know a lot about MinnKota as they are a large customer of mine and if the MotorGuide unit hadn't come with my new boat I would have bought the MinnKota.
