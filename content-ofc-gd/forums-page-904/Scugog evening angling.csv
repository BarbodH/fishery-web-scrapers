Anyway, just wondering if anyone can direct me to an area that presents an easy access point to get to fish from shore that is fairly well used (like, where the other huts are).  Just don't want to venture out to some isolated patch of thin ice after dark and go for a swim with the muskies at this time of year.  Beyond that, I'll take GPS coordinates to all of your hotspots, a free guided trip, I'll use your favorite baits and lures and hog all the fish (just kidding).  Appreciate any tips you can offer on getting out thee safely to where others will be fishing.  Can I buy minnows in town in the evening or do I need to get there earlier?  Cheers,  MoB"

299771,Master of Bait,2009-01-31 18:12:00,196,"Awesome Jt - that's just what I was looking for, thanks.  I'm sure my manual auger with dull blades will be a real peach on 17-18 inches of ice!  2 more quick q's:  I'm on foot - is it a long walk?  Can I buy bait in Port Perry around 7-8pm or should I go earlier?  Thanks again,  MoB"
299775,Joeytier,2009-01-31 18:25:00,3990,"Causeway Bait (on the 7a directly on the way) is open until 7 I believe.  And yes, it's about a 20-30 minute walk, depending on the snow."
299777,GBW,2009-01-31 18:35:00,8460,you can get a map here MAP if you need it.  I'll be out just North of Birch Island tomorrow morning so good luck!
299780,Master of Bait,2009-01-31 19:01:00,196,Thanks guys.
299802,Joeytier,2009-01-31 21:18:00,3990,Thanks for the link!  I'm printing out that map of Scugog right now.
299805,GBW,2009-01-31 21:28:00,8460,no prob.  I'll be there tomorrow in the old broken down hut of my wife's uncle and may need some local help if I cannot find his auger...
