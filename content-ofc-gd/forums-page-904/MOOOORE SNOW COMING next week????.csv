300095,solopaddler,2009-02-01 15:04:00,8605,  Yep the first thing you're taught is how to use big impressive words that mean nothing.  (It's not an exact science y'know  )
300119,irishfield,2009-02-01 16:45:00,26272, LOL Mike... gotta get back into shape somehow! I was the youngest certified ski instructor in Canada when I was 13 years old.   (and that was a long time ago ! lol) Gettin real tired of being run down from behind and constantly using your peripheral to avoid snow boarders though. Sure takes the fun out of it for the skiiers. All three of us got hit last night. Jen the worst and my hip and ribs are bruised.
300121,douG,2009-02-01 16:49:00,2693,"According to my favourite weather forecaster, Al Sleet, the weather will continue to change, on and off, for the foreseeable future."
300138,Roy,2009-02-01 17:54:00,13728,"Man, did I ever love to watch Percy Saltzman do his schtick on CBC. I worked with his lovely wife Rose in the late 60's for a benevolent cause in Niagara on the Lake. Great experience, good cause, great people and Percy, may you rest in peace."
299424,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-30 15:29:00,2050,"Yeah we've been getting hammered with snow all week... Good thing my brother-in-law is living with us for a little while rent-free....Get out and shovel boy! lol It took him a sold 2 hours yesterday, and that was the smaller of my TWO drive-ways!"
299431,solopaddler,2009-01-30 15:37:00,8605, Your forecast is always different Wayne. Not much you can do about that never ending lake effect coming off Georgian Bay.
299440,LeXXington,2009-01-30 16:27:00,1928,"I share a 8 foot front lawn with my neighbour, we have got too the point of carting snow too the back yard.  If the weather gets above freezing I am going to hook the hose up too the hot water tank and clear a bit.  It may leave ice but the least it can do is compact the snow so I can add more.  How long till spring again!!!!"
299446,solopaddler,2009-01-30 16:45:00,8605,  HAHA! Yep I hear you on that. When we bought our place last year dealing with snow was the last thing on my mind. Needless to say the 8' high cedar hedge that runs along the left side of the driveway has become a huge source of frustration. I've got no where to put the snow on that side so have to shovel everything over to the other side (or cart it over on my daughters toboggan).
299447,Stoty,2009-01-30 16:47:00,2910,Weather network is saying maybe 1-3 cm for us...YET...the US site (as Cliff said)  Says this!
299450,ccmtcanada,2009-01-30 16:58:00,7971,"Yeah...wonder who will be right??? haha.  There is a guy that specializes in Canadian weather on accuweather.com  He has a blog that talks only about Canada...and he's right a lot more often than Environment Canada and The Weather Network.   His storm totals are usually dead on!  If you are interested, here is a link...  Click here for Canadian Weather Blog"
299454,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-30 17:20:00,2050,"Yeah I use Accuweather when planning a fishing trip to.  Like Cliff said they're more reliable, and usually the weather is either exactly what they say, or better...it's never worse.  If I'm going rain or shine, I usually look at The Weather Networks predictions, because they're always optimistic! lol"
299456,fishnsled,2009-01-30 17:24:00,3520,  Thanks for the link Cliff.  I say bring it on!!  It's why I bought a snowblower a few years ago.  Now do you want to come over Cliff and use it again??  LOL!!
299458,ccmtcanada,2009-01-30 17:33:00,7971, Last time I trusted that you had a procedure done...  This time I'll need a doctor's note....LOL.
299494,fishnsled,2009-01-30 19:34:00,3520, 
299625,Greencoachdog,2009-01-31 01:35:00,8163," Ok... first you need to learn the metric system properly if you're going to use it!!!  15-25 cm. = 1.5-2.5- decimeters!!!.. or .15-.25 meters!!!... or do y'all like to use centimeters because it makes yer tallywhackers sound longer than they actually are?... ""mine is 10 centimeters long"" sounds much better that 4 inches eh!  Second... if you wouldn't eat that dirty snow... you wouldn't hurl it back up!!!  Thirdly... a 5 gallon (19 liters Canuckian) can of gasoline and a Bic lighter go a long way when trying to find room to put more snow somewhere!!!   Dammit man!... do I have to do all the thinking around here???"
299675,snag,2009-01-31 03:44:00,1932,"1st,  From what I hear,  You need all the mm's you can get. (that's not candy, though it does melt in your hand too)  2nd,  If you did all the ""Thinking"", or as they say in your neck of Banjoland: ""Thankin"", I would have blasted that commie snow back to Snovakistan with a 12 guage by now.  3rd,  Go drink a MGD, GCD. (BTW, thats .00000000000000000000000000000000000000000005 alcohol content Captain America)  My snowman scores more than you do."
299686,ccmtcanada,2009-01-31 04:15:00,7971,Don't worry bout it now...apparently the models are changing and southern Ontario could get a big fat 0cm of snow now....LOL.
299688,Greencoachdog,2009-01-31 04:42:00,8163,  Scoff!!!
299702,lookinforwalleye,2009-01-31 11:46:00,4399,no worries here I will be in Cuba!!
299729,kickingfrog,2009-01-31 14:41:00,8333, Have you been told today???
299742,Greencoachdog,2009-01-31 15:45:00,8163," Yeah, they were talking aboot flow snurries here for Tuesday a couple days ago, but when I checked the long range forecast this morning... they'd taken them out and raised the high for Tuesday up to 43*F... freezin' cold for me, but Parka and shorts weather for y'all eh!!!  It's gonna be a pretty nice day here today with a high of 57*F, I think I'll do some gardening... the Daffodils and Crocus are popping up everywhere!!!  .... it's gonna be in the 60's tomorrow eh!!!"
299766,kickingfrog,2009-01-31 18:01:00,8333," Have you been told today!!!  Besides, your icefishin' sucks!"
299878,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 00:38:00,8163,  Don't pick on me too much Daddy-O!... or I'll post pics of flowers blooming and stuff growing!!!  ... that always seems to bring y'all an  load of snow!!!  Hope you're having a great frozen weekend with the new young'un Pops!!!
299913,diggyj,2009-02-01 02:00:00,548,It's snowing like a mofoc right now in the Jax! Wasn't expecting it until Monday/Tuesday. What gives?
299984,irishfield,2009-02-01 04:59:00,26272,Snow... spent the evening skiing in freezing rain... were the hell did that come from Solo ! You do that.... lol
300043,solopaddler,2009-02-01 12:17:00,8605," We're definitely in the midst of some potentially volatile and changeable weather. Still seems as though the system will miss us now (fingers crossed).  What's really amazing is that you were out skiing, never mind the freezing rain. Impressive!"
300069,Roy,2009-02-01 14:11:00,13728," Hey Mike, do all weather folks learn that sentence in weather school? AKA we don't know what the hell it's gunna be like today either."
300073,ccmtcanada,2009-02-01 14:15:00,7971,"Yeah...volatile and changeable...kind of the same thing...  And then the ""just do ya don't quote me"".....potentially....LOL."
300074,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 14:19:00,8163,"Roy and Cliff, I wouldn't aggravate the weatherman up there too much... he's liable to take a big snow dump on ya!!!"
299136,snag,2009-01-29 20:26:00,1932,"Where?  WHERE??????????????????????  Seriously, I have built a ""snow wall"" on either side of the driveway that I can't hurl snow over and I've run out of real estate! If I push it onto the road the plow pushes in back onto me or my neighbour!  At least my car is safe, LOL.  "
299137,PatrickGG,2009-01-29 20:29:00,562,"Do what my son did Stick snow balls in your coat pocket and they will eventually melt in your home when the coat is on the hanger, there's also the option of building Igloo's."
299138,Leecher,2009-01-29 20:29:00,7832,That's one way of winterizing your vehicle
299141,snag,2009-01-29 20:32:00,1932,"  Hahaha,  I did that when I was a kid.  We even did the snowball in the freezer trick.  Gave my brother a concussion in July with it.  He's still not ""right"" these days."
299144,PatrickGG,2009-01-29 20:34:00,562, LMAO! I remember trying the snowball in the freezer trick also but my mom always found them and chucked them into the sink.
299147,GBW,2009-01-29 20:45:00,8460,"I just looked at the weather network and I'm set to get 15CM on Mon, 10CM on Tues and another 5CM on Thurs.  But this Sunday looks great to get out on the ice for a bit..."
299177,diggyj,2009-01-29 21:58:00,548,You can shovel it into your boat if you have it in your driveway or garage.
299182,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-29 22:07:00,182,I build jumps in the hill in my back yard and hit it on my sled but thats if yur a real thrill seekrt
299185,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-29 22:14:00,2038,Throw it on the Neighbours side...   :lol:
299227,misfish,2009-01-29 23:38:00,29133," Dont bother,they will call the cops on ya. It,s true."
299258,irishfield,2009-01-30 00:54:00,26272,That snow bank looks like MY laneway Snag!
299300,kickingfrog,2009-01-30 02:37:00,8333,  VW and all Wayne???
299302,Roy,2009-01-30 02:47:00,13728,But his VW has wings.
299303,irishfield,2009-01-30 02:53:00,26272,Do they still put air cooled engines in them things... lol
299311,snag,2009-01-30 03:19:00,1932,"Funny boys.  Back in the day, I owned a 68 VW Van.  Wifey and I bought it in 1990 and moved back from rainy, depressing B.C.  What a great van!  Interestingly. When it rocked; Nobody knocked. Must've been the timing belt  I gained an appreciation of ""Air cooled"" engines.  I still sell them to this day in the form of generator sets.  Now that I'm older;  Everything knocks....."
299343,douG,2009-01-30 05:24:00,2693,"Droll as ever, Snag.  You got a 250 kw 400 - 1000 Hz source handy?  We could do a motor/gen set too.  Pm if you choose.  The knocking explains that annoying rattle."
299389,Headhunter,2009-01-30 13:55:00,5703,"Well, my son and I have been tunnelling in the snow banks for weeks! He's loving it and I'm having a blast spending quality time with him... although admittedly, I'm starting to get tired of shovelling! Atleast we didn't get the ice storm our neighbours to the south did... that looked nasty and even more so for folks who aren't used to this kind of weather. HH"
299395,snag,2009-01-30 14:08:00,1932, Sure do.  We go up to 3250kW.
299396,snag,2009-01-30 14:12:00,1932," Me too,  My son is loving the tunnels. We built a couple snowmen and he's giddy over snow angels.  It's hard to get a 2 1/2yr. old to keep his mits on!"
299397,bigugli,2009-01-30 14:15:00,6138,Used to dig out a quinzee in the yard that would sleep 4 and let the boys in the scout troop camp there to work on their winter skills before going on an actual winter camp.
299400,ccmtcanada,2009-01-30 14:27:00,7971,"Environment Canada and the Weather Network seems to be downplaying this storm.  Other sites like Accuweather.com and The Weather Channel (Both US sites) are saying it's going to be a huge one.  Some are saying potentially the worst snow/blizzard since '93.  They are predicting cities shut down in PA and NY all the way up to Buffalo...with 12 to 18 inches of snow...then wicked winds...causing blizzard conditions.  Apparently the jet stream is going to go so far south that they are talking snow in New Orleans (not sticking around), but accumlating snow in Alabama....watch out GCD!!!!  At any rate...watch out Monday/Tuesday!!"
299403,snag,2009-01-30 14:35:00,1932,"Thanks Cliff,  Regardless,  I told my wife that I'm staying home Monday and Tuesday.  I think I can justify the $'s to my boss.  Unless he believes I can make money spending 4hrs each day in the car?"
299415,solopaddler,2009-01-30 15:15:00,8605,Talked to some cohorts at E. Canada this morning and it seems they are indeed changing their forecast. Seems we may get.....nothing.  One can only hope.
299417,irishfield,2009-01-30 15:22:00,26272,Yah... tell me that again Mike!  Another 8 inches since I went to bed at 1am and my plow truck is broken. Guess I'd better get off of here and get to the shop and get back to wrenching!
299423,Headhunter,2009-01-30 15:28:00,5703,"Wayne, you could use the plane to ""blow out"" the driveway! HH"
