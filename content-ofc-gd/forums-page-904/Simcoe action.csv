Got the truck parked and gear together left at seven and had one hell of a walk pulling the portable. After nearly having  multiple heart attacks from the tough walk i had arrived at where i wanted to be and had my first line down by 8:15. Not two minutes later after i was getting the hut set up and heater going the still line with a minnow on goes off. Landed a three pound laker and i though to myself maybe this was going to be a good day. Anyways marked alot of fish and had alot of fish follow my spoons around but no more takers. So i decided to try the old white tube jig. THe fish seemed to show alot more interest in the tube, and i finally coaxed one into biting. Landed about a four pound laker. Ended up missing one more on the tube and one more on the plain minnow outside. Didn't end up with any whitefish, but didn't get skunked so the walk was worth it. Gonna head out in the morning and search for some jumbo perch.  "

299874,12footspringbok,2009-02-01 00:30:00,459, I was in 104ft of water.
299875,Joeytier,2009-02-01 00:32:00,3990,"I'm surprised at how the majority of reports are close to, or exclusively lake trout.  Are the whities in shallower, or just not biting as readily?"
299943,Fisherman,2009-02-01 02:41:00,7201,"Hey I recognize that little coleman stove in the corner, it's got a strong return spring.."
299965,waterwolf,2009-02-01 03:41:00,556,"the near heart-attacks were worth it ! you scored large .   in between the missed and the hit ,, a great day to be out  on it!!  some decent size lakers now know why they shouldn't come 'bove the ice.  great post!!"
