The episode broadcasts (full length shows) are seamless and the newer ones even tell you all the details, down to terminal tackle used, on the screen while the video is playing. I also love the fact that they show a short graphic of where and how they were fishing, including relationship to current, structure, etc. By a long shot, the best show website I have seen. Jim"
