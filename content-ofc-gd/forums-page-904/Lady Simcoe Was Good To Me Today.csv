Didn't see much on sonar but bait.  We walked out 2 miles into the lake and did well there in over 100'.  It was a long hard walk, but worth it.  We went 6 for 9, got there late and left early.  All on the small Williams ice spoon and shiners on the tip ups.  Lakers were between 3 and 6lbs, no biggies.  Whities eluded me today.  Innisfil Bait and Tackle has awesome 4"" emerald shiners, $5. for a liberal dozen.  It was recommended that I do not drive out there, as the ice is unstable for vehicles in that area. Oh well, it was good excercise!  Will post pics after Sat., I will be going back again Sat morning.  Hope to see some of you there!  Good fishing!  Aaron"
299248,Leecher,2009-01-30 00:44:00,7832,Great report Aaron You got rewarded for your hard work.... congratulations  Will keep an eye out for your Sat report Thanks for sharing Leechman
299622,vanillagorilla,2009-01-31 01:33:00,46,"It was like being on an episode of ""Survivorman"" with Les Stroud.  Aaron said after the first hour of fishing that we should go on a 2 mile walk (Death Hike) out to the ""ZONE"".  Always being game to catch fish I said sure let's do it!  He warned me that it's going to be a challenge.  I really did not believe him.  Wow was I foolish!!!!!  Hiking out there with a sled full of Ice Fishing Equipment, a Clam, my Camera Equipment and 2 Monster Smoke Meat Sandwiches felt like pulling a fully loaded Ford F-150 with a full size family inside.  But once we hit the zone Aaron went into action and we started crushing Lakers.  We did not catch anything gigantic but he had a blast running for the Tip-Ups and having fish follow our Spoons for minutes at a time from 100 feet upto 50 feet.  This was one of my first times out Ice Fishing and I was really surprised how much technique was involved.  Being a novice I had over 12 fish follow my spoon but only got one to actually take a swipe at it.  Here are a couple of pictures from the day.  Aaron's First Fish of the Day!   Aaron's First Tip-Up Fish   My First Lake Simcoe Laker   Aaron KING OF THE LAKERS   Aaron ""MAKER A GIANT LAKER"" for me     Thanks again for a great day on the hard water buddy!"
