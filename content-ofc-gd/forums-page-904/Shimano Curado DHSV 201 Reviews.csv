300183,ironstone74,2009-02-01 20:41:00,201,"Hey guys,  I have a chance to buy a Curado DHSV 201 baitcaster lightly used for $135.  I've never owned a baitcaster but I think this is a deecnt reel for the price.  What do you think,  is it a good reel for the money???  thanks  Paul"
300187,bassjnkie,2009-02-01 20:57:00,1101,"I had the 201 a little while back. But sold it to a newbie. That is one sale I really did regret. It was smooth, quiet, casts a mile, and had a wicked drag system. For your first baitcaster it's the way to go. I was actually thinking to pick up another one. BTW, I am a Daiwa guy. But Shimano reels are great."
300199,bucktail,2009-02-01 21:32:00,1857,"Great reel, you wont do much better! I have 2 200's and a 300 and there great!"
300202,mikeh,2009-02-01 21:33:00,824,Is that one of the newer model ones?
300203,charlied,2009-02-01 21:34:00,584,"not sure what model I have, bought it 4 years ago.  I use mine for salmon in the fall and it is like a winch.  I can lay the boots into a big salmon in the Niagara and it works great."
300205,ironstone74,2009-02-01 21:35:00,201,"Yes, I believe it was bought in 07 or 08.  P."
300251,SlowPoke,2009-02-01 23:09:00,2984,"It's the older ""D"" series, new ones are ""E"" series. You might be able to find it used a tad cheaper but it's a great reel. If you're getting into baitcasters, it's a great way to do it. Buy a great reel once and avoid frustration."
300271,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-02 00:01:00,2038,"Shimano reels are bulletproof...   201 is a great reel ,, go for it"
300502,BillM,2009-02-02 15:18:00,17367,tackletour.com most likely has a review on it.  I've heard nothing but good things about the Curado.
300540,Garry2Rs,2009-02-02 16:39:00,1425,"Two cautions... First, the DHSV has a 7 to 1 gear ratio which means you will wear yourself out cranking big baits. It's great for worms, flipping and pitching jigs and other light baits, but not big or deep diving baits. Second this is a left hand model. That's fine if you are left handed, but take it from me, I have both left and right handed bait casters, right handed caster are better served by right handed reels."
300546,OhioFisherman,2009-02-02 16:46:00,6623,"10-4 what Gary said, about 1/3 off the price of a new one and if the reel is in great shape well worth it.  Like to see how these reels are still performing after they have been around longer myself, old ones, green had brass gears, new ones aluminum, lighter, but as durable?"
300585,ironstone74,2009-02-02 19:00:00,201,"Thanks guys,  if I can get it for close to 100 bucks I will pick it up.  Now bring on Spring  Paul"
