299101,BillM,2009-01-29 18:35:00,17367,"Hey guys,  I'm looking at upgrading my arsenal by adding in an ultralite spinning reel.  This will be used on my Fenwick UL 6' rod for chasing brookies and any other unsuspecting victims that I may encounter   This is going to be a dedicated small stream reel..  I'll be using either 2-4lb mono, small #0 and #1 spinners.  I currently have a lower end quantum that I picked up in a rush and the drag is anything but smooth.  Some shakers in the Notty gave that reel a work out and I was lucky that I even landed them.   I've been looking at a Stradic/Sustain series, the Quantum Energy E10PTi-B series and I guess anything else someone can suggest.  I'll be using this reel 2-3 times a week, so it needs to stand up to the constant usage.  Bushwacking isn't easy on reels as you know, so something sturdy is definitely needed.  I really like the 750 Sahara series for the size, but wish the higher end Shimano's came in those sizes (Stella not included, way out of my price range)"
299122,Victor,2009-01-29 19:43:00,1609,"IMO the sedona/sahara are great reels ... especially for its price tag  but if you looking at something more highend ... have you looked at the shimano saros? I think its 1000 size is actually a 750 body, just that the spool size is 1000"
299127,Photoz,2009-01-29 19:59:00,792,"I have Sedona 500's on both Frabil ice rods, and one each on a 6' Fenwick HMG (1 - 4 pound) and a 6.5' Shimano Clarus . . .   perfect for anything from smelts to just about ANY panfish, or much larger fish. For some real fun . . .    a spool of 2 pound line, a Sedona 500 & a 6' Fenwick HMG fishing the suckers along Simcoe in mid April . . .    some of 'em hit 5 pounds! Not at all expensive either . . .     about $70.00, with taxes . . .    a GEN-U-WINE BARGOOOOOOON!)"
299128,buckster,2009-01-29 20:00:00,530,I have to agree with Victor.  I have a few sedona and sahara reels.  Great little reel in the 750 series.
299130,MJL,2009-01-29 20:08:00,2427,"I have a Daiwa Laguna 500.  Not sure if they're made anymore but it has a smooth drag.  I've landed 2-3lb smallies with it in the past and the drag is smooth.  My only gripe is the drag knob doesn't click when you adjust it but in terms of performance, I can't complain."
299131,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-29 20:11:00,10439,I have a 500 series ABU as well as 500 series Sedona and 500 series Quantum Energy PTI. The PTI is the best but also the most expensive of the bunch.
299149,bare foot wader,2009-01-29 20:49:00,1354,"I have ultra light reels from quantum, okuma and pflueger....all about 40-50 bucks and all of them are great reels  the pflueger president is very nice...my personal fav....but I know okuma has a few tiny sizes in a few of their high end models for sure....but I cna't justify dropping so much cash on a tiny reel that i wouldn't use as much as my more versatile reels.....but i bet they would be good....."
299154,capt bruce,2009-01-29 21:08:00,820,"I have 2 Quantum Energy PTI I think I paid 120 or so each, Great little reels ,going on  three years old now and never gave me any trouble , used both summer and winter . Very smooth drags"
299176,solopaddler,2009-01-29 21:54:00,8605,"Bill I have the exact rod in my arsenal of ultralights and run a Stradic 1000 on it. That rod needs a reel in the 7oz range to balance it properly, the micro light reels don't cut it. Go for the Stradic you won't be sorry."
299195,Rustic-Fisher,2009-01-29 22:37:00,826,"You won't find a reel that takes a beating like the 750 Diawa SS whisker.(ultra light) By no means the smoothest reel when compared to newer units out there,  but it takes a beating and still preforms day after day. You either love 'em or hate 'em but that's the one I reach for on my backcountry excursions  Stardic 1000 is the backup.  RF"
299205,holdfast,2009-01-29 22:51:00,1813,"I have a BPS Micro-lite Supreme which works great in the bush.  Excellent drag and holds alot of line.  I also have a Mitchell 308 on a longer rod that I use for Pickeral, Panfish, and trolling puny Rapalas. Comes with an extra spool.  So I got a choice of 4 or 6 Lb test.  Almost forgot, also a Daiwa 750 ultra lite, smoothest Drag in the world and tough "
299206,Radnine,2009-01-29 22:53:00,1538,Spring Boat and Fishing show coming up in a couple of weeks. Could be some deals and lots to check under one roof. Jim
299207,solopaddler,2009-01-29 22:53:00,8605,  I think you mean the 700. Definitely good reels as well and in the same weight range.
299210,holdfast,2009-01-29 22:55:00,1813, I second it for the SS
299211,holdfast,2009-01-29 22:57:00,1813," Yup your Right, 700, I just looked at my pic."
299212,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-29 23:00:00,3761,My friend has a Shimano Compre 5'6 UL Spinning rod and a Pflueger President Micro Ultralight reel with it. He has nothing but perfection to say about this rod and reel combo. The reel is a good price and can be found here at BPS-> http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults   Have a look!
299219,Photoz,2009-01-29 23:15:00,792,"Just thought I might mention . ...   when you're looking at reels, does ANYONE check to see where you can get warranty or normal maintenance done. (Canada . .   U. S., Europe?) I stick with Shimano, not only because I find them very reliable, but also because I can get quick efficient repair work done either at Aikmans (Mississauga) or up in Peterborough. (Head Office) SOME reels have to go stateside for work, can be stuck for weeks . . .     not too important until your fave reel coughs out a week before opener!"
299341,Rustic-Fisher,2009-01-30 05:11:00,826,"Thats right , my bad RF"
299346,BillM,2009-01-30 05:57:00,17367,I got a wicked deal and pulled the trigger on a Shimano Saros F.  I like the fact that it uses the 750 body with the 1000 sized spool.  Should go great with my UL.  Thanks guys!  
299377,Greencoachdog,2009-01-30 13:27:00,8163,I have 2 Stradic 1000's and love them!!!
299393,Victor,2009-01-30 14:06:00,1609,"YES i won  lol. just kidding  Enjoy it Bill, I have a 3000 size one and love it."
299411,Fishnfiend,2009-01-30 14:54:00,357, Ditto.
299430,River Rat,2009-01-30 15:36:00,161,"I second SOLO on the stradic 1000......I still have some old AERO 1000's before they called it the Stradic. Great reels, smooth drag and affordable.  RR"
300600,98Fahrenheit,2009-02-02 19:56:00,108,The Shimano Sensilite is awesome!
