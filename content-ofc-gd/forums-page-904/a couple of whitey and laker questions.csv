299435,silvio,2009-01-30 16:05:00,433,I have a few questions... Do you guys tip you williams... if so with what what size minnows do you usually use on set lines? small or med  Thanks hopefully I will get some pics tomo.
299437,tonyb,2009-01-30 16:08:00,1637,No need to tip williams (some use those pearl hooks)...medium sized shiners work well 3-4inches in size.
299504,buckster,2009-01-30 20:06:00,530,Some people take off the treble and dress it with a chartuse micro tube and put it back on the spoon........ works good!
299507,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-30 20:10:00,0,If you decide to TIP the Williams ice jig with a minnow be ready to receive a ticket for having three extra hooks. It has 3 hooks as it stands. When you add bait to it each point becomes a hook. So you will have 7 hooks with bait instead of 3 with out bait. Hope that helps. You don't need bait on Simcoe.
299509,cityfisher,2009-01-30 20:14:00,959,Doesnt hurt to try but last season a plain williams got it done most of the time.. sometimes we just threw a shiner head on the trebel
299553,Leecher,2009-01-30 22:26:00,7832,Foxee jig tipped with white Gulp fish fry worked for fishing 24/7 last weekend Leechman
299554,Leecher,2009-01-30 22:29:00,7832,Forgot to mention.... lakers love it too
299583,xeon,2009-01-31 00:01:00,350,"Med shiners or dace for lakers. For days when the fish are very aggressive I prefer the small treble through the dorsal hookset for the minnow.  I usually dont tip the williams spoons at all, just incase it ruins the presentation it makes on the drop. But sure you could try it if nothings working."
299597,kickingfrog,2009-01-31 00:40:00,8333,"I have used scented ""plastic"" minnows exclusively for the last few years. Lakers, whitefish, walleye, pike and perch never an issue. I'll tip my spoons just like it was a real minnow. I don't use the plastics on set lines though."
299609,kickingfrog,2009-01-31 01:07:00,8333," My understanding of the regs was that 4 hooks (excluding the ever present exceptions) are now legal (a treble or dual hook counting as one on a lure, but 3 or 2 on bait), and that by adding even something as simple as a small spinner blade would convert ""bait"" into a ""lure"". In other words, adding bait to a lure doesn't make it bait, but adding a lure to bait makes it a lure.  Doesn't impact me since I take the dual hooks off so that they don't catch on the hole... and I don't use bait.  I wonder what a CO's interpretation would be?"
299679,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-31 03:54:00,0,"All I know is that they will ticket you if you add a treble trailer to a LURE that has one treble hook already and add bait to that. Counts as 6 hooks with bait or two with out bait.  I know you can't use live bait with two trebles as well. Counts as 6 hooks. That's why they started selling quick strike rigs with a single and one treble. Also down  on Erie they use a lure with two treble hooks, body bait, what ever. Some add a worm to that for sent. That gives them 6 hooks again. I know I can put 4 trebles on my Musky baits....but I don't....lol Maybe one on the top of the lure...Hmmmm Its' just the addition of bait that changes things. Thats the way It was  been explained to me but I could be wrong."
300039,walleyemaster,2009-02-01 12:04:00,325,on simcoe no bait needed...i have never used bait on simcoe and have always caught fish... but lake temagami.. i always use bait on my lures...so use bait on some lakes and dont on others...i think it the lake you fish will determin if you should tip your bait or not...
