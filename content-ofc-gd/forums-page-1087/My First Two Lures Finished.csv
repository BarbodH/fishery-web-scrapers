158080,lew,2008-02-06 23:56:00,12767,"Sorry Ric, I somehow missed this thread entirely.  Very impressive work you've done there, and the 1st thing I thought of when I looked at them was that they reminded me of baby squid..... long slender body, eyes set way back and the hair on the back resembling tenticles.  Hope they put some fish on the beach down there for ya"
157485,FishHeadRic,2008-02-05 06:25:00,226,"Hey gang,  It's been a long boring winter down here to say the least. Can't do work on the boat so l've been trying my hand at lure building. here's some pics of the first two I finished. The first one is coated in quail feathers. After sealing and hard wiring the plug I base coated it yellow and then used coats of clear nail polish to affix the feathers onto the lure. After I got the effect I was looking for I painted the mouth and belly and then coated it in E-tex.    Really happy with the way this one came out.    It's weighted to just over 2.Oz and sits on a nice 45 degree angle with it ass just under the surface.    This second one l did is a slow sinking Needle Fish. Used like a sub-surface jerk bait. (Mostly for rough surf and fast currents) This one was actually made for my best friend's wife. She just got into fishing last summer so l had to make it all pretty and stuff    Yes that is a diamond behind it's eye... I used to do setting and casting work a decade or so ago. They're just foil backed crystals but l thought it would be a nice touch for my buddies little Princess.    I've got a bunch more turned and waiting for paint. Airbrush is up and running so l'll post some more when l get 'em done.  FHR"

157487,medmart,2008-02-05 06:53:00,587,Thats a job well done they look great  rob
157488,FishHeadRic,2008-02-05 07:19:00,226,"Hey Danbo, lt's hard to see in the pics but the belly of th pink one is pearlized. l've got an air-brush and have been using cretex paints with it. The pearl just dosn't show up though.  Thanks Rob, much appreciated!  FHR"
157489,bowshep,2008-02-05 09:01:00,378,Great Job. l dont think l would fish with the first one if l made it its just too Nice.  Peace Ken
157492,solopaddler,2008-02-05 09:40:00,8605,"Wow, amazing work!"

157535,FishHeadRic,2008-02-05 13:13:00,226,"Thanks Ken, Mike, Roy, Cliff. Matt, I'd like nothing better then to hit the hard ice right about now but unless you can pick me up (in NYC) it might be a little hard. Guess I should change my location on my info card eh? Where were you when l was living up at Young and Eg.  FHR"
157536,b2kptbo,2008-02-05 13:17:00,1505,"Very cool, Ric..."
157537,corvette1,2008-02-05 13:18:00,1765,nice paint job they will catch fish
157542,mattyk,2008-02-05 13:21:00,2110,some real nice looking lures.
157544,Terry,2008-02-05 13:27:00,14456,I think they look great  how long is the first one
157547,ccmtcanada,2008-02-05 13:49:00,7971, I've worked at Yonge/Eg for the past 15 years....trouble is I only started fishing again at the end of 2006...haha.
157548,snag,2008-02-05 13:59:00,1932,"Very nice Ricola,  You are braver than I. I would become far too attached to deal with the heartbrake of losing one."
157595,shane,2008-02-05 16:19:00,652,  That's what I was thinking.  Those are beautiful.
157708,highdrifter,2008-02-05 22:25:00,2534,That's some nice handywork FHR.  Those grouse breast feathers give that popper a sweet effect!  Here's to getting your boat ready for her maiden stripper voyage budday!  cheers HD
157727,Ramble,2008-02-05 23:40:00,713,Awesome
157740,fishindevil,2008-02-06 00:16:00,6254,Nice work !!!.  .now we need a few pics of them in action come open water.  .
157753,Bernie,2008-02-06 00:56:00,3190,Very good work indeed!  Couldn't imagine using it and getting a bunch of teeth marks. Sure would look good at my cottage on the wall. Beautiful work of art.
157760,Crazyhook,2008-02-06 01:15:00,1154,would love to try that down south on the cudas!! nice looking baits Ric
157828,kennyman,2008-02-06 04:06:00,737,I was thinking the same thing. That lure is a piece of art. I hope the fish appreciate how beautiful it is. They'll be lining up to jump on the hooks.
158003,setomonkey,2008-02-06 19:53:00,872,"Those are great-looking lures Ric, what are you planning to use them for?  Mike"
158073,FishHeadRic,2008-02-06 23:36:00,226,"Thanks Guys for all the nice compliments! Very much appreciated. Terry the first one is 8"" and just over 2 Oz. Grant I actually gave the feathered one to my best friend down here. He also said that it was too nice to use but I made him promise to catch at least one fish with it before he pops it onto his mantle. I turned out a half dozen of that size & pattern. That one was the only one that got the feather treatment. The others are on the drying rack right now. I did different patterns on all of them, Yellow w/ red head, all yellow (school-bus), perch, pearl with coloured spots (wonder bread) and an eel pattern. I like to paint 'em but it's really not that important in my opinion. The action of the lure is what really matters. Mike I made all of these for the stripers down here. Pencil poppers are weighted in the back end so that you can cast them out as far as possible and keep them out there. The way they're worked is after they land the fisherman tucks the surf rod between his legs and grabs the rod just under the first guide. Shaking the rod while taking in any slack that is caused by the shaking. When weighted right, the lure will pivot on its rear end with it's nose swinging side to side. (You muskie guys think you've seen some explosive hits...) I've often thought that these would make great muskie lures. I'm going to be coming back up toward the fall so I guess I'll see then...   FHR"
