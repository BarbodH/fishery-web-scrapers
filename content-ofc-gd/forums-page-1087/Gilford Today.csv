157172,irishfield,2008-02-04 15:05:00,26272," There's more chance that a sledder will run you down out there... then him crashing, let alone into you, but it is indeed illegal."
157175,Beans,2008-02-04 15:27:00,3339,"A name eh ?...Only thing that comes to my mind is ""Smelly Smelt"" as in ""Smelly Cat"" seeing as how ""Percy"" has already been used...  "
157176,oldphart,2008-02-04 15:35:00,665,"~~~~  Great post and pics, but I hate Smelts when phishen for Trout and Whities, unless they're deep fried"
157213,ccmtcanada,2008-02-04 18:30:00,7971,Beauty report Joey!  Looks like you guys have that ice fishing thing down cold. (pun intended).  Paul's monster?  Your carp would have eaten that fish plus it's entire family....LOL.
157803,fishboy,2008-02-06 03:10:00,550,"here smelty, smelty, smelty..."
156953,Joey,2008-02-03 22:58:00,9122,"Met up with Terry at Gilford today and we all caught fish pretty consistently, and not too many dinks either.  It was a great day, quite warm in the morning with the sun shining.  Paul ended up catching the largest fish   , and Terry caught either a herring or the biggest smelt we've ever seen, and his personal Smelt PB     Maybe even a smelt line class record  You be the judge:  Smelt/herring pics first.        Paul's monster      Me with a little guy.    Paul landing another.    And another    Terry's first of many today.    Here's Paul's and my Haul.  We tried to keep ones with some size to them.    Saw some of these guys out today.  Looks like fun.  Ice fish trolling    Thanks for meeting up with us Terry.  Had alot of fun today.  Hopefully we'll get out for those lakers and whities soon.   So, can anyone name that fish????  Joey"
156956,Jen,2008-02-03 23:02:00,833,"I am saying Smelt Joey, looks like you guys had a wonderful day... nice smiles!  cheers Jen"
156962,Terry,2008-02-03 23:10:00,14456,"I say  it's a smelt.....  I had a good time today, we got on a pretty good spot with every few dinks and  every now and then couldn't get one lure down and the other one was going off.....I like it when we are that busy........LOL  Lets do it again soon.......    anyone going out from Gilford watch out the whole shoreline have a pressure creak and much of it moved so you have to walk along the 2x8s they put out to get over it or just go for it with an atv or snowmobile , sure am glad the water isn't very deep there"
156965,fishindevil,2008-02-03 23:20:00,6254,"Hey great day of perching on the lake for you guys !!!!...and for 100% sure terry you sure did get a huge smelt !!!!nice pics too joey,and it looks like everyones going to have a good fish-fry too!!!!the weather couldnt have been better by the looks of it,lots of people out too i see,   cheers   oh ya terry fry that smelt up in butter"
156966,steverowbotham,2008-02-03 23:25:00,1800,"for some reason te smelt pics wont load for me, but the perch pics will, either way, nice haul"
156971,irishfield,2008-02-03 23:34:00,26272,Thanks for the beauty report Dear !  That Terry guy... always the center of the party. Bet the bugger brings something strange up from the depths of Temagami as well.
156976,Terry,2008-02-03 23:42:00,14456,oh and had the aquavu down for a while  and saw a big carp go by then a while later I spun the camera around and there right on bottom sat a carp..just sat there looking at my bait but not moving I jigged and wiggled and just couldn't get it to bite then it just swam away..it amazing how much mud it stirs up
156978,tjsa,2008-02-03 23:55:00,1578,"Pics are slowly loading for me, but for sure, absolutely, unconditionally, that fish that Terry caught is a Rainbow Smelt. the largest I have ever seen btw, and I have seen some big smelt up here from superior, and  a few inland lakes where they have been introduced and proliferate. We occasionally catch them when fishing for lake trout, on set lines, with 4 inch minnows????????"
156985,Greencoachdog,2008-02-04 00:07:00,8163,"Great report and pics Joey!!!  Fishin' is lotsa fun when the fish want to play and keep you busy!  Those are all nice looking fish, and I'd say that Terry caught a Whopper of a Smelt!!!  WTG y'all!!!"
156989,douG,2008-02-04 00:17:00,2693,"Great report, Joanne.  Very nice photos too.  You are loving your camera, I see."
156999,Fisherman,2008-02-04 00:33:00,7201,"Ya, a smelt, way back about 20+ years ago, it was quite common to catch 12 inch smelt around Lefroy, a dozen of them fried in butter with a beer would result in a mighty BUUUUUURRRRRRP!  Hard to find them that size on Simcoe now."
157002,mattyk,2008-02-04 00:37:00,2110,great report!
157047,tbayboy,2008-02-04 01:26:00,1497,"No idea what kind of fish that one was but I gotta give Paul congrats on that lunker of a perch.  Bitsmith and I were out at gilford today as well and did pretty well(eating my perch poppers now actually) but most were in the 8-10"" range.  Did you guys see the kamikaze pilots out - one guy couldn't have been 15 feet off the ice buzzing shacks."
157056,medmart,2008-02-04 01:54:00,587,great report joey congrats to Paul on the perch looks like yous had a good day out  rob
157070,Ramble,2008-02-04 02:31:00,713,Another good trip out.  Solid Report. Keep them coming.
157071,irishfield,2008-02-04 02:34:00,26272," If he's actually that low then you can easily read the letters off the fuselage side. If he didn't land or take off, to have an excuse for the height... call Transport Canada at 4900 Yonge St. and have them lift his licence... I personally have no use for such behaviour."
157072,Joey,2008-02-04 02:38:00,9122," I take it that is illegal Wayne?  We saw them but they weren't that low when we did.  But I have seen them that low before while fishing Simcoe, back and forth buzzing over our heads.  Joey"
157078,irishfield,2008-02-04 02:52:00,26272,"Must remain 500 feet vertically and/or horizontally from any building, boat mast or known assembly of people unless taking off or landing. They know there's people out there....  The only time I come close to what they're doing is cruising Wasaga Beach in the summer time ! LOL"
157096,mistyriver1,2008-02-04 04:11:00,600,"WTG you guys , nice report.  How thick is the ice ?"
157109,Terry,2008-02-04 10:55:00,14456,"it was 14"" out where we were fishing"
157112,Spiel,2008-02-04 11:01:00,9065,"....Very nice, very nice indeed. I concur with those who say it's a smelt because it is. Like Fisherman said some 20 odd years ago you could catch them without fail. Night time was best and they sure grew big!"
157119,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-04 11:40:00,1362,Nice report!!....Looks like you picked a really nice day to be out on the ice....
157152,Bitsmith2k,2008-02-04 13:58:00,396, he couldnt have been more than 15' off the ice.. i thought was was going to crash... it wasn't like the ice was empty either.. he did it over a crowd of people fishing..  wish i knew enough to get letters off his fuselage..
157156,Roy,2008-02-04 14:20:00,13728,"Beauty report, Queenie! Glad you had a good time...sure looks nice and bright out there."
157160,solopaddler,2008-02-04 14:33:00,8605,"Looks like a lot of fun, thanks for posting!"
