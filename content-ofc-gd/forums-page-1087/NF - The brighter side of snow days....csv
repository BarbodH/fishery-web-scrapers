Plus, even if I wanted to head into the office, I couldn't get out of my driveway first thing because of the snow plow!  I usually take the GO train on days like this, but a quick check of their service showed me that even if I got to the station, I would have been seriously delayed...most of the westbound trains were cancelled this morning during rush hour.  So, snow pants went on, and armed with a shovel, my daughter found out how much fun DEEP snow can really be.  Here are some pics....the smiles and laughter is worth the dumping of snow we just got!       "
158238,irishfield,2008-02-07 16:38:00,26272,That Rink should look real now bud! Snow lined.. somewhere comfy to fall... you did shovel and flood it today didn't you. Haven't got lazy have you?
158240,ccmtcanada,2008-02-07 16:44:00,7971," LOL...I spent an hour and a half on the rink this morning.  The snow did a real number on it...turned most of it to slush.  Had to shovel it all off, scrape off the slush and then flood it all over again.  The low part  was melted all the way to the liner.  A few more floods and hopefully we'll be skating on it again by the weekend!  "

Ironically she looks like she's about to pounce like Tigger in the second picture.  We're still getting it here.  Nothing like snow to bring the kid out in ya!!!
