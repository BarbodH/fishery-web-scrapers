158302,highdrifter,2008-02-07 19:37:00,2534,Lady and I saw one right over us driving last night downtown.  Musta been all the static energy..  yeeee
158320,setomonkey,2008-02-07 20:21:00,872,"Yup, heard and saw it last night. Also remember the same thing happening in mid-December, it was snowing and blowing around and then I saw a flash, I actually thought a power line went down at first...  Mike"
158067,lew,2008-02-06 23:30:00,12767,"I was out shovelling snow about 30 minutes ago and saw a large flash, then heard this loud rumbling starting, then as it got louder I realised it was thunder. It actually lasted about 20 seconds and was like what you'd hear during a summer storm.  Guess we've all heard winter thunder, but this was much longer than I've ever heard before.  Interesting stuff !!"
158069,FishFinder,2008-02-06 23:34:00,481,really bored eh??
158070,Kawartha Kev,2008-02-06 23:34:00,281,Hey Lew I saw 2 large flashes of lightning and a small rumble of thunder from my basement out here in Scarborough strange indeed!!!  Kawartha Kev
158071,huntervasili,2008-02-06 23:34:00,1604,"Didn't hear any today Lew but saw lightning and heard thunder yesterday, while it was raining lol"
158074,Nemo,2008-02-06 23:39:00,727,Heard it just around Dinner. I just got in from shoveling the driveway.
158075,danbo,2008-02-06 23:41:00,2646,"I saw & heard it too..just the Angel's ""bowling"" up there!"
158076,Bernie,2008-02-06 23:43:00,3190,"One of the local fish hut operators nearby had his house struck by lightning couple weeks ago. Burned to the ground. Some of you maybe know Mel McCabe. It was lightning storm that rivaled a strong storm in the summer, very unusual."
158078,solopaddler,2008-02-06 23:51:00,8605, Actually being a weather guy it is kind of interesting  .  I'm currently on shift at the weather office in Hamilton and recorded the exact same phenomena at precisely 22:52 zulu (6:52 for you laymen  ).  Quite a system we've got here....hope I make it home tonight!
158079,Roy,2008-02-06 23:51:00,13728,"I just called up a radar screen for where you are Lew. Looks like the stuff is just hovering over that whole area. You might be getting a little batch of snow overnight too. Everyone, be safe driving out there."
158081,tdotfisherman,2008-02-07 00:00:00,317,yep.. the thunder was booming in old east york..
158082,lew,2008-02-07 00:03:00,12767," Yeah, a little batch indeed Roy  Just happy I don't have to drive anywhere for the next week"
158083,huntervasili,2008-02-07 00:04:00,1604, Its been snowing pretty good here in Burlington for the past while... looks like we may end up with a bunch more of the white stuff
158090,Gerritt,2008-02-07 00:26:00,6129,scared the white right outta me! saw a huge white flash.... I thought maybe a transformer blew or something... then realized I still had power... and heard the rumble..  G.
158092,Joey,2008-02-07 00:28:00,9122,"Having a thunderstorm in Richmond Hill right now, and the thunder is long and rumbly just as you described Lew, like in the summer.  Joey"
158114,ketchenany,2008-02-07 02:06:00,3229,"Just got in from cleaning my driveway  left work Yonge and Eglinton at 5, was at Pinevalley and Hwy 7 at 6:05 (6 km from home). Lighting was really bright, thought it was a tranformer blowing up, going nowhere fast turned around, back down to Steels West, got home at 7:45. Never buy a home that you have to go up steep hills, doesn't matter what road you take. I had no problems as I drive a 4x4 Jeep but any vans or cars, they were done and everyone was left behind them.  Drive safe. It's till coming down up here."
158115,HTHM,2008-02-07 02:09:00,4082,"So.....let me understand this. It is shooting bolts of electricity from the sky, and you are sitting behind an electronic machine that would act as a very good conduit for the electricity that needs a place to go to get to ground!??? Hey what could go wrong? Maybe I am being a    and need to be All in fun, eh!"
158124,fishing n autograph,2008-02-07 02:57:00,2540,yup...as i was pushing my car out of the big pile of snow in front of the 401 on ramp from the 407...also lost my cell phone too...not a good day

158136,Ben_Daniels,2008-02-07 04:10:00,435,I'm on Danforth and I heard it and saw about 3 or 4 really bring flashes to the north... it blinded me
158146,Tybo,2008-02-07 06:01:00,1373,I was working in it  . One was so close it light the hole area blue with the snow. and the thunder was there before the flash stopped.
158183,muddler,2008-02-07 13:04:00,623,"Nope, that was just my mother-in-law passing gas and my father-in-law turning on his giant TV. LOL."
158229,ShaunB,2008-02-07 16:18:00,73,While I was shovelling I saw this intense blue light flash and then the thunder rumbled on for a good 15 seconds.  Kinda freaked me out at first
158263,addy79,2008-02-07 17:59:00,573,"my dad works for CP Rail, last night he saw a big bolt hit the rails and travel along the rail about 100M! Must have been a cool sight to see"
