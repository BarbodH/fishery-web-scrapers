They seem to go hand in hand to me...I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't coincide...  Our tax dollars funding geniuses again... Tony"
157615,ccmtcanada,2008-02-05 17:21:00,7971,"I suppose because license free fishing weekend was planned long before the new holiday came to be.  Events have been planned across Ontario to coincide with the license free day since last year.  The new holiday came into existance in the 2nd week of last October.  You are right though, hopefully the rocket scientists at the govt will bring them both together next year!"
