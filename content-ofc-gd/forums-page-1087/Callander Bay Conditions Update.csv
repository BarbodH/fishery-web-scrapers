The storm that rolled through there Thursday night/Friday morning did not help.  Only a few pike and pickeral managed to find there way to the topside of the hardwater.  I stayed at Glen Echo.  The new owners did a very nice job.  Drilled all of the holes we could want, and went out of their way to be of service in all respects.  Good luck to you this weekend."
