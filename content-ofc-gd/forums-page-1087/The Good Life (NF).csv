""Chief Two Eagles,"" one official began, ""you have observed the white man for many years. You have seen all his progress and all his problems."" The chief nodded. The official continued, ""What do you think of all the white man has done?"" The chief stared at the officials for more than a minute, and then calmly replied. ""When white man found the land, Indians were running it. No taxes. No debt. Plenty buffalo, plenty beaver. Women did most of the work. Medicine man free. Indian men hunted and fished all the time."" The chief paused, then added, ""Only white man dumb enough to think he could improve system like that."""
