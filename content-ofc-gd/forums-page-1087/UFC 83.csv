157618,darsky,2008-02-05 17:31:00,586,Any one lucky enough or rich enough to get tickets? Good seats are going for 800-1000 EACH.For 1 ticket you can get a week in the Islands or 2 days with Thorpie.I would take the week.but Thorpie is a close second. WAY WAY out of hand
157620,Terry,2008-02-05 17:37:00,14456,yeah more then this poor boy can afford  I can barely afford to watch it on PPV for free...LOL
157628,Basskicker,2008-02-05 17:45:00,421,"I can't wait!!! Managed to get 2 tickets in the upper bowl for under $200 through ticketmaster.  I watched the news conference and Dana White said it's going to be the largest UFC EVER....around 22,000 screaming for St.Pierre.  It's going to be insane!!!!!!  Floor seats were $550...now going for $1600-$1900...insane or what?"
157634,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-05 18:14:00,698,I'm going. 5th row on the floor! Also got 3rd row on the floor for next months UFC in Columbus!
157645,Bitsmith2k,2008-02-05 18:52:00,396,"took a look at the prices for the tickets yesterday, 100 level tickets @ $400 a piece..  add in a hotel room for a couple nights.. plus ""entertainment""..  dont think i could sneak that one past the wife..."
157694,irishfield,2008-02-05 21:16:00,26272,"Heck.. I wish they'd reopen the Brule' Hotel in Penetang. I could watch better than UFC, for free, on any Friday night.... after the ""island folks"" cashed their Goverment cheques at the bar."
157735,TJQ,2008-02-06 00:05:00,7806,"Ill be watching it at home...  PPV with 53 inch widescreen, wings, beer and the wife... best seats in the house.. I would like to get to one of the events live though.. that would be really cool.. too bad I already spent my 2 g's on cuba in april..."
157764,Crazyhook,2008-02-06 01:17:00,1154,have a buddy fighting trying tog et down... but FLorida is two weeks later. getting a week in FLorida pass was hard enough
157852,sharper,2008-02-06 04:58:00,279,"I'll be there if all goes well. 13,000+ plus tickets were sold in the first 24 hours, it's going to be a great fight!!!"
