157600,irishfield,2008-02-05 16:35:00,26272," FAR from it and always the first to admit it..... count just means that I take the time to read and reply to darn near every ""proud moment"" that members post, as without such responses from members this board would come to a screaching halt. If all we had is takers, and no givers, OFC would be a pretty sad looking place.  I do of course get in the odd fishing outing of my own to share around here...good landscape and scenery shots anyhow!"

157450,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-05 02:42:00,957,Maybe government will place a retroactive tax on message board posts.
157453,Roy,2008-02-05 02:45:00,13728,"Connie, for something to be taxable it has to be worth something."
