158335,Headhunter,2008-02-07 20:59:00,5703,"Ok, what I want to know is what did that poor BBQ ever do to you? How about a cover on that thing? Poor little guy, sitting all alone, covered in snow, you should be ashamed of yourself! I hope you don't expect your next bbq meal to come out right! LOL HH"
