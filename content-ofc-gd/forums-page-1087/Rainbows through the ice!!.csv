157203,Doctrt,2008-02-04 18:02:00,141,"Hey Guys,  Got out to fish some hardwater bows.  We had a great day but really had to finesse these fish that were keyed in the eggs we were chumming.  In the end a #12 sedge and single egg on 3lb fluoro with no weights did the trick.  Several big fish were released as well.  Unfortunately I didn't record any that sucked in the bait.  Pretty tough to set the hook and video at the same time. Enjoy the pics and video.  T      Feeding Trout Video"
