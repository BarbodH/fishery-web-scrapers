157849,irishfield,2008-02-06 04:43:00,26272,Sad part is he got what he wanted Roy... Looked like he had about 6 hours to fill a lot of mail boxes with a link to where he wants people.  Maybe that Rick fella has a way to defeat the use of the PM function until you have a set # of posts or a time period. Same should be done to lock the classifieds to a few that have used it and never posted to a thread...one ongoing as a business.
157855,Greencoachdog,2008-02-06 05:24:00,8163,"With a name like Rene, and she's a he?... He told me she was a she and I was the only one!!!  Duped again!!!"

I've got unlimited dialup and I send it at night when I'm going to bed. Probably doesn't do any good but makes me feel better!"
157886,tjsa,2008-02-06 12:22:00,1578,"Oh, thats who that was. I got the same pm on this board, and on another board where he is an infrequent contributor, and just ignored it because I did not know who ""renegade"" was, or cared to respond. I was not interested in what he offered."
