157571,Stoty,2008-02-05 15:34:00,2910,"OK, that's it. I am going to Florida next week, and I have decided that I am not coming back!  I am sick of the white crap!!"
157579,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-05 15:48:00,0,Like it's been bad or something  Bring it on. We need it! Still have some hard water to cover. I wonder why people who live in a country like Canada would ever complain about  snow..... There's always Florida.
157580,Raf,2008-02-05 15:51:00,3495,"what gb said, bring it on!"
157582,Terry,2008-02-05 15:54:00,14456,"at this point, I would like to be able to see the ice I am walking on..ok riding on, I don't walk very far  if we get much snow you can't see the thin ice   ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WINTER STORM THREATENING TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.

MEANWHILE..YET ANOTHER MOISTURE-LADEN WINTER STORM IS TAKING SHAPE OVER TEXAS THIS MORNING AND IS SETTING ITS SIGHTS ON SOUTHERN ONTARIO. THIS SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING THE SCRIPT OF MANY PREVIOUS STORMS THIS WINTER SEASON. BUT THIS STORM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE IS RELATIVELY MILD AIR OVER ONTARIO AHEAD OF IT. AS IT TRACKS NORTHEASTWARDS REACHING OHIO BY WEDNESDAY MORNING..INCREASING WINDS ARE FORECAST TO TAP SOMEWHAT COLDER AIR FROM A BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER NORTHERN ONTARIO.

REGIONS FARTHER NORTH WILL LIKELY RECEIVE SOME SNOW BUT BELOW THE WARNING THRESHOLD OF 15 CENTIMETRES.

157596,irishfield,2008-02-05 16:22:00,26272,"Well watching A channel last night Terry.. there ain't much ice out there. Roaches point, that someone here was fishing the other day, looks a tad wet to try and make those shacks in the distance."
157602,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-05 16:40:00,0," I'm hoping that the cold gets here BEFORE the snow does. Next week looks Mint for ice making. Yer right about us needing less snow and more ice. I'd think by now that you would not venture onto thin ice with out checking first.   We picked our way out this passed weekend to a spot we hadn't been to with sledders running by us like we were nuts to check as we went. We found anywhere from 3.5"" to 5 "" where we were. There are still those cracks out on Simcoe right now that would swallow any machine. Roaches Point is unsafe out passed the point. It was open water a few days ago. Only 20' of it but enough to sink the Quad..."
157603,KyleM,2008-02-05 16:41:00,218,"I cant believe you guys complain!!!!!!!  Was it not just 10 degrees not all that long ago.  Dang, Id be out in my shorts ready for golf season."
157604,largemouth,2008-02-05 16:44:00,112,bring on the snow and the cold
157695,Headhunter,2008-02-05 21:18:00,5703,"updated from a ""Watch"" to a ""warning"". Guys, I'm a frost bitten Canadian boy who can handle the cold and snow with the best of them... but to be honest, my 50 minute commute will grow into a 90 minute commute very quickly if what they say is coming, arrives. On the bright side, my son and I will be able to put a second story on the snow fort we built on Sunday! HH"
157746,fishing n autograph,2008-02-06 00:28:00,2540,crud! i'm supposed to meet Pete Rose tomorrow in Vaughan......i hate the snow
157750,ccmtcanada,2008-02-06 00:33:00,7971,"Oh goody....extended period of freezing rain...then snow on top.  I don't mind snow...just take it slow, but freezing rain scares the bejeezus out of me!!!"
157846,HTHM,2008-02-06 04:39:00,4082,And body shops!
157858,Raf,2008-02-06 07:14:00,3495, that reads like a mastercard commercial.  second story of snow fort - priceless.
157860,Woodsman,2008-02-06 07:47:00,1286,Currently raining fairly heavy here just north of London. 1 deg C. Evidence of some earlier snow or ice pellets. Not freezing yet but quite slushy.  Rick
157871,solopaddler,2008-02-06 10:44:00,8605,I'm riding out the last 1/2 hour of my shift at the weather office. We've had a horrid mix of weather all night in Hamilton and currently have freezing rain and ice pellets. Careful on the roads...
157878,lew,2008-02-06 11:56:00,12767,"I've been out driving around Toronto abit this morning and we've got around 4-5 inches, but it's very thick & heavy so traction is excellent as long as you've got GOOD winter tires.  Sposed to stop for awhile then another go-round this evening"
157883,Big Cliff,2008-02-06 12:15:00,6899,"Just started snowing here in Lindsay about 1/2 an hour ago, big wet flakes. looks like a perfect day to put a big pot of soup on the stove and bake some fresh bread."
