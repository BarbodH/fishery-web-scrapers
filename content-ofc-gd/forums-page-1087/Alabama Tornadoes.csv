157923,lew,2008-02-06 14:21:00,12767,"Glen, the Toronto news this morning reported upwards of 50 people killed by the twisters down your way last night, good to hear you & yours made out OK !!  Makes our 6"" of snow last night  sorta pale in comparison."
157931,OhioFisherman,2008-02-06 14:36:00,6623,"Latest CNN is saying 45 dead in 4 states, but not everything has been checked yet. Black Tuesday!  Glenn, glad your ok! Connie? have we heard from you yet!"

Glad to hear our OFNer's state side are ok... that was one nasty bit of weather! HH"
157947,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-06 15:53:00,957,"Okay here Paul, but I was awake much of the night tracking storms.  West of Nashville was hit pretty hard with 24 deaths and many more injuries.  The number could grow as they check through debris.  A lot of people did a great job keeping the death toll and injury totals down in Jackson, TN., especially at Union University where there was extensive damage to dorms.  All I had at home was a little wind blown rain that ended up giving me a 3' diameter wet spot in the ceiling of my bedroom.  We're coming off tornado watch right now."
