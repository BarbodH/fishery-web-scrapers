158141,JerseyDog,2008-02-07 05:21:00,190,"For the record, the ""street racing"" law was a knee jerk reaction to a car crash that killed a couple and orphaned a child.  The two kids who were ""racing"" were initially blamed for the accident, however once the investigation was done, they determined the kids were maybe going 20km over the limit (not 150kph like the paper said) and the man who was killed was well over the legal limit for booze AND turned left in front of the kids who were ""racing"" making the accirdent HIS fault.  And while I personally would prefer if kids did not race on our busy roadways, one person running at 150kph is not necessarily racing and not even necessarily doing anything unsafe (except maybe if he was towing a boat)."
158150,fishing n autograph,2008-02-07 08:56:00,2540," FYI, 172(1) the ""street racing"" law has alway been on the books. it wasn't a knee jerk reaction, they just added the automatic 7 day licence and 7 business day impound of your car.....fine has always been up to 10k......trust me, when you catch kids doing 50kph over the limit in a 40 kph area, your mind changes.....the guys that drive that fast haven't learned their lesson at all....they usually have a huge rap sheet anyway"
158192,cranks bait,2008-02-07 13:54:00,721,"Two words for everyone here that speeds in excess ""SLOW THE FIRETRUCK DOWN""  There is no reason to go that fast.  Yes everyone speeds, but there is a point where it is stupid.  There is nothing worth doing it for.  Speed kills!!! Trust me I know first hand.  Also clean your vehicle fully.  This includes all windows the lights and roof.  No ones life is worth less than five minutes of your time.  My rant for the day. Time for a coffee."
158206,corvette1,2008-02-07 14:50:00,1765,that ticket was 10 years ago it was on your thansgiving just blew up the boat motor not happy then i just got passed on left shoulder he was doing over 160 he through stones at my tahoe was trying to see his license plate just going to fast guess caught up in the heat of the moment not to smart.
157322,fishing n autograph,2008-02-05 00:44:00,2540," The HTA makes the registered owner of the vehicle responsible regardless of whoever is driving. In some cases, the RO can be charged for the offence.  Not sure if points are involved. But if the fine is $180, thats the price for Red Light - fail to stop  Anyway, for those interested.....our radar/lazer trap caught over 80 speeders and ALL of them going at least 20 KM over the limit in the city...some where doing as much as 70 in a 40.....not cool....but fun to catch 'em"
157327,irishfield,2008-02-05 00:50:00,26272,"All I can tell you is I have the souvenir photo sequence print out and the cancelled cheque, for $180, from when my daugher was 0.18 seconds late entering the intersection of Bronson/Carling Ave at 3:52 AM  Same corner that a week ago three Carlton Students where killed in a Yukon that nailed an OC transpo bus doing the same thing. More than glad all I had to do was pay $180 and add it to her tab."
157482,Canuck,2008-02-05 04:40:00,491,I got my first ticket in over 20 years in Bradford on hyw 88 last April after coming out from the Tims on 88.  They had just dropped the limit to 50 from 80 between Bradford and 400 and an OPP nailed me at 85.  I did not see the sign (actually was blocked by a construction sign) and I have driven that stretch off an on for 10 years when it was 80.  I asked him how long has it been 50km and he told me it was as long as he could remember.  (I wasn't going to call him a liar) I asked a local about 15 min later and they said it was changed about 2 weeks earlier.  I couldnt believe he did not cut me some slack.  4pts and $200 plus.  I am taking it to trial on principle. Not every officer has common sense.
157491,fishing n autograph,2008-02-05 09:39:00,2540,At trial your ticket will be dropped probably from 35 over to 29 over....$130 and 3 pts.....that's what they did for me 5 years ago....you get point back after 2 or 3 years

I have NEVER had a ticket for driving/speeding, actually, I've never been pulled over and wouldn't know what to do if I did!LOL I drive ""like an old woman"" as my wife says, but my insurance rating is excellent, I don't have to pay tickets and I arrive at my destination a couple of minutes behind the folks that go rippin by me. I guess sencond place is alright by me! HH"

Also, if I happen to have one and it works and the cop turns around to bust my arse....What happens if I whip that sucker out the window before he spots me? Will he take my car in for the tear down?  What if they dont find it because its in the ditch? Do I still have to pay to get my car searched by a mechanic if they dont recover anything?  All hypothetical mind you LOL"

157780,KyleM,2008-02-06 01:49:00,218,"By a radar detector working I mean, can you detect it in my vehicle.  The only way I can speed is if I cruize in N down a hill.   I loved the drive out west....getting passed by fully loaded transports going up hills."
157782,irishfield,2008-02-06 01:51:00,26272,The only way they found radar detectors was to drive BEHIND people and flick the gun on and off.. waiting for people to hit their brakes!
157863,fishing n autograph,2008-02-06 09:01:00,2540, The hand held radar unit that we use has a function to detect a Radar detector. But the people who have them in their car have it for a reason and they all get caught at some point.
157874,jat,2008-02-06 11:05:00,138,"hmmmm......was wondering, is there a statute of limitations for parking tickets as well? Anybody know?"
157875,CLofchik,2008-02-06 11:10:00,854,"The only non-detectable radar detector out there atm is a Bell STi.  Everything else they will know what you have and they WILL tear your car apart to find it and take it out.  Even if you're not speeding you WILL be stopped and you will not be let go until they have it.  Any built in system will simply have parts snipped off it until it is no longer serviceable (eye in the grille, control head, nice quick way to lose $1k).  Laser jammers are quasi legal, they are illegal to import, but not illegal to use (yeah I know, you figure it out).  Radar jammers are totally illegal, user beware.  A Bell STi will run you around $500-$600US, but if you put on alot of km in a year and the exorbitant fines we have in Ontario (highest in North America) they pay for themselves in one avoided stop."
157946,corvette1,2008-02-06 15:49:00,1765,rocky mountain radar has jammers radar detectors all in one just got my new one a month ago works great they pay the ticket the first year 200$us

157242,Danubian,2008-02-04 20:37:00,65,"1. If you didn't get pulled over, you are fine; this time only. ""Speeding Trap"" is not working the same way as a ""red light camera"". I guess it's part of police's procedure to pull you over, let you know about the offence and hand you the ticket.  2. When traffic is light, stay within the speed limits, otherwise ""move with the traffic"" and in general try as much as possible to not single out yourself. (I'd like to think of the lion chasing the buffalo herd: he'll never catch one that runs with the herd.)   Offtopic: Does anyone know what was the legal outcome of the red-light cameras? At some point it's been challenged in the higher Courts for the photos being accepted as evidence in Court. It was dealing with the fact that there is only circumstantial evidence that a certain person actually drove the car, since there was presented only a snapshot of the car/license plate. The cameras are still around, though..."
157247,CLofchik,2008-02-04 20:56:00,854,"All the laws for photo radar are still on the books, just not currently being enforced. The legislation for red-light cameras are separate, but work the same.  The owner of the vehicle is fined, but no points.  The OPP don't pull people over for anything under 30-over, unless it's near the end of the month and they are short on ""performance expectations"".  City  traffic po-po will bust anything and everything.   Jat, you're fine.  It was a laser setup on a tripod you saw (they can zap you out past 2km with that), if you were paying attention you might've seen a few chase cars just past the bridge, usually parked on the onramps.  If you weren't ticketed on the spot you aren't going to be."

157313,John Bacon,2008-02-05 00:35:00,3277, This is no different than a parking ticket.  I don't see any difference between ticketing the owner of a car when they don't know who parked it and ticketing the owner for speeding or running a red light without knowing who was driving.  It would be different if demerit points were involved.
