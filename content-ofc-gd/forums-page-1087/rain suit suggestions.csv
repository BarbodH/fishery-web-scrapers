156023,Jen,2008-01-31 15:29:00,833,  I got mine as a gift! However they came from Fishmasters Bait and Tackle.
156037,douG,2008-01-31 16:08:00,2693,"BPS 100 mph, here.  Not only is it Goretex, but it is also tough.  Definitely go for the bibs rather than pants.  It has a very high collar, and neoprene cuffs, and is bulletproof.  As Wayne says, the only downside apart from price is all the BPS gingerbread stuck all over the place.  BPS should pay me for the advertising."
156115,tschirk,2008-01-31 21:28:00,261,I bought my Shimano Gortex Rain Suit from Gagnons last spring on sale <$500. Love it! Ted
156118,cranks bait,2008-01-31 21:44:00,721," Not to change the topic here, but did you say Basstalk in Ottawa?  Do you have info for this, maybe in a new thread.  I was intrested in your other one, but it was too far for me to go."
156126,Moosebunk,2008-01-31 22:06:00,3970,"Yep, got the BPS Gore-Tex coveralls.  Sweet.  Helly Hanson raincoat... Not to shabby at all."
156138,carll2,2008-01-31 22:47:00,443,thanks for all the info guys..seems like i have alot of options here..seems that i can get the shimano goretex suit aT cost price...hmm still debating  shimano or 100mph suit
156140,solopaddler,2008-01-31 22:58:00,8605,"Cabelas Guidewear hands down in my humble opinion. Get the bib pants as well, they're worth their weight in gold when you're sitting in a boat all day."
156174,wjw,2008-02-01 01:27:00,35,"I bought the Frogg Toggs rainsuit at the Cleveland Sportsman show for $59 four years ago. I am very pleased with it. The suit is light weight and keeps me warm & dry.  In addition to fishing, it easily fits into a golf bag and has accompanied me numerous times to fall high school football games."
156204,Tomcat,2008-02-01 02:38:00,395,"Here's another vote for Cabela's Guidewear. I've had the bibs and parka for three years now. I'm with Wayne on this one - best money I've ever spent on fishing equipment. Regardless how bad conditions have been, I've always stayed dry in my Guidewear."
156260,douG,2008-02-01 05:36:00,2693,"I don't think anyone of us, except noncommittal Dave, has tried all three or four of these suits, so it will be tough to guess which suit might be best *100mph*.  I am sure that they all offer superb performance and are a comfort to wear.  You gotta be happy and comfy in any of these suits in any kinda weather, the Shimano, Cabelas or BPS  gear.  A suit like that is a large investment in fishing gear, but I would easily trade half my rod and reel collection to keep that suit.  I think it will last for many years.  "
157705,carll2,2008-02-05 21:45:00,443,wow awesome suit doug...im still waiting for the specials then il pick up the guide wear or 100mph whcih ever one is cheaper
155889,carll2,2008-01-31 01:25:00,443,"hey everyone..im starting to get ready for yet another season of guiding, which brought me to think of a new rain suit. now last  season i had bought some crappy one from canadian tire and after 2 hours of beeing in intense rain id start feeling water getting in, keep in mind ican spend anywhere from 3-9 hours in the rain so i need something good....shoot away any suggestions ya have..thanks"
155893,irishfield,2008-01-31 01:29:00,26272,"Leah and I love our Gortex outfits. Coat and rain pants about $250 each. Wish we had of spent the money years ago.... stay dry and on the water, without sweating to death inside like you do in a cheap ""slicker"". Was a priceless purchase considering it always seems to rain just as we step foot on the marina dock to head for our island in the open steel boat."
155895,Jen,2008-01-31 01:31:00,833,"I got a shimano gortex suit last year and have absolutely loved it.  It keeps me totally dry in the worst weather and with a couple of layers in the winter months very warm.  It may cost a little more but is well worth the money.  Just a suggestion, if you check out my posts you will see me wearing it in a couple of them.  Cheers,  Jen"
155900,carll2,2008-01-31 01:34:00,443,if you dont mind me asking where did you guys get yours?
155901,huntervasili,2008-01-31 01:36:00,1604,Yup... Gotta love Goretex! Thats my vote too... If it says Gore-tex I would trust it
155906,irishfield,2008-01-31 01:43:00,26272, Carl.. Leah and I both managed to find coats and pants that fit us at BPS and they were also the ONLY style that didn't have BPS plastered onto them in 10 places.
155911,Rich Clemens,2008-01-31 02:03:00,3131,Same as Wayne for me.  Gore-tex suit from BPS.
155916,NANUK,2008-01-31 02:08:00,797,"BPS Gore-Tex is good stuff, Cabelas guide series is one of the best out there as well. http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...r&noImage=0"
155922,carll2,2008-01-31 02:24:00,443,wow cabelas has some nice stuff..i like the guide series but wow 250$ for just the bibs then again i payed over 800$ for my gore tex snowmobile suit and its well worth it...still shopping around...if anyone has any other suggestions or expiiriences keep em coming
155927,troutologist,2008-01-31 02:43:00,951,I got the jacket and bib in cabelas guidewear and was extremely happy with the performance. Wore them everyday last summer guiding and nothing bad to say. Only thing sitting in a boat I think the long parka wouldnt ride up as much as the jacket. I went with the jacket to double as a wading jacket. Not a problem if youre wearing the bibs too though.
155931,irishfield,2008-01-31 02:54:00,26272,Yep $250 just for pants Carl.. like I said.. that's what we paid for each piece x 4 for the two of us = $1000. Best thousand I've spent in a long time. Note they were also pretty much the cheapest gortex available at BPS.
155933,Roy,2008-01-31 03:07:00,13728,"Hey Wayne? It's 10:10PM, your post count is at 9,924...are we celebrating at ummm what 11PM for the 10,000 mark?"
155938,irishfield,2008-01-31 03:19:00,26272,"Naaa.. Maybe tomorrow, my fingers are getting tired bud... and I'm running out of"
155939,nofish4me,2008-01-31 03:19:00,404,"My last rainsuit was by Wetskins. I was wearing my suit when I was at the lakes edge doing dishes. Well, that ""Boot Sucking Sauce"" that's at the waters edge, sucked me in. We were camped on the Canadian Shield, it had been a wet day and I was wearing rubber boots and my rainsuit. When I finally stopped sliding in, I was upto my chest in the water. I won't go into details on how helpful, my buddies were. When I finally got myself back on shore, the only part of me that was wet, was a small area at my waist where my Buck Tool was. I nolonger have a rainsuit, but I do have a Raincoat, surprise, it's also made by ""Wetskins""."
155941,Zib,2008-01-31 03:30:00,369, I'll second that. My buddy has the Cabelas Gudie Series & it's been working great for him. He tripped & fell in the water on our fly-in trip a few years ago & the only thing that got wet were his feet. I have the cheaper knock off Gore-tex from Cabelas & it has worked great for me.
155948,carll2,2008-01-31 03:59:00,443,hey zib whats the cheaper knock-off from cabelas? damn shimanos stuff is hard to find..their website has nothing
155949,outdoorguy61,2008-01-31 04:16:00,220,"If you are serious about rain, take a peek at a Frog Toggs product. Cost effective and it works.  outdoorguy61"
155950,camillj,2008-01-31 04:20:00,1988,For my money I really like the wetskins (about $125 at CT) .. I look like an offshore cod fisherman .. but hey I am WARM and DRY on the coldest spring ZEC rainy days ... works for me  .. I even used it on the ice last year before I got my fancy shmancy Helly-Hanson survival suit
155954,Markystang,2008-01-31 04:55:00,131,"My old man swears by his Frog Toggs. If they keep rain out on the motorcycle, they should work fine fishing."
155956,troutologist,2008-01-31 05:05:00,951,Carl just keep in mind you have to be on the water everyday and be comfortable  longer than your clients. my advice is spend a bit more and be sure.  my 0.02
155958,trapshooter,2008-01-31 05:36:00,1234,"I'll put in another vote for the BPS 100MPH Gor-tex rain suit.  I've used mine for 3 seasons guiding and it is bullet proof.  A lot of the other guys I guide with have the Cabelas Guide Wear and while it's good they all get a wet crotch on an all day rain while I stay dry in my BPS suit.  Bibs are the way to go, no question.  Believe people when they say it's the best money you can spend... especially as a guide when you're out ther everyday."
155960,carll2,2008-01-31 06:56:00,443,im not sure yet but i thinkk il go with the 100mph suit...but one question when you order from bps does the order go to the ontario store or to the states? if it goes to the states il get nailed for duty and shipping thats what sucks...if thats the case il look for something around here
155999,walleyemen,2008-01-31 14:21:00,316,"Try Marks Work Warehouse they got some good stuff priced very reasonable. i use the Viking Boga Chill line they have and it's a great suit, mind you i haven't spent all day in it either, but it has kept me dry when i have used it. I think the jacket and pants cost me around $200.It's a v-tech fabric? very light and easy to stough away."
156004,David Chong,2008-01-31 14:41:00,836,"I've had the Cabela's Guide Wear, BPS 100 MPH & Pro Qualifier Rain Suits and they've all been great! I think as long as you buy a quality(translation expensive) rain suit you'll do fine. I've heard real good thing about the Shimano Gore-Tex Rain Suit, everyone who has one seems to love them. We are giving one away as an early bird bird prize at the Bass talk session being held at Paddletales just outside of Ottawa. If you were considering attending maybe you should wait on that purchase get your registration in before the early bird and win that $450.00 Rain Suit! That would be sweet! Dave"
156008,Canuck2fan,2008-01-31 14:45:00,1444, Don't worry about extra duties and taxes from BPS the total price you see on the website will be in U.S. dollars but you won't pay extra at the door.... The only difference will be the exchange rate your credit card charges you order at the right time you could even save .00005 cents on each dollar.... Cabelas is the same btw the price they quote you includes everything. However if you look at the little extras they tack on for shipping handling taxes and duties you can easily pay for a tank of fuel to go the BPS store in Vaughn.... I bought a pair of 99 dollar breathable waders from Cabelas by the time I got them with all the extras and the dollar only worth .92 U.S it wound up being 172 bucks.... But I couldn't have driven to Michigan for that 73 bucks either LOL.  Helly Hasen has a breathable suit available at LeBarons for about 160 or so and if you order from them you won't have to pay PST unless you live in Quebec so that would make the shipping darn near free.....
