It works fine for me whether I'm down in the Kawartha's or up on Lake of the Woods. 8lb is a good general purpose line. All my spinning gear has mono (Trilene XL 4,6,8,and 10lb test) and my baitcasting gear has PowerPro in 50, 65, and 80lb test."
158027,bbog,2008-02-06 21:22:00,665,I started out using Trilene XL than thought I would get fancy and try other lines. I have been very happy with SilverThread that I have tried in lighter varieties.  Sometimes you gotta stick with what works and ignore the marketing hype.
157300,wjw,2008-02-05 00:05:00,35,"I have been using 12 lb Stren ""Sensor"" for the past 5 years. I love the low-stretch quality and the hook setting ability of the line when fishing for pike. I have had very few breakoffs and have brought in 2 50+ inch muskies using it. I used Trilene XL prior to the Stren. Last year I had difficulty finding the Sensor and believe that it may have been discontinued."

157515,Jer,2008-02-05 12:16:00,1426,"...another vote for Silver Thread Excalibur...  I've used it for several years on all my rods in various sizes. Very strong for a mono and I find that it untangles better than many other lines, works well in the winter as well."
157659,Zib,2008-02-05 19:28:00,369,"I've used Trilene Sensation (6lb) and have been happy with it. Cast really well & good knot strength. The BPS flouro is really good as well. By all means stay away from Fireline Crystal, that stuff us total crap."
157673,Headhunter,2008-02-05 20:25:00,5703,"I'll be the odd guy out here and suggest Ande bulk line! Been using it for years, it holds up well and when it starts to get bad, just rip it off and re-spool. 1000yds for $12.00! Can't go wrong! HH"
