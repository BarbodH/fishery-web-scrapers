87380,douG,2007-06-25 14:43:00,2693,"Great report, Cliff.  It was a huge pleasure to finally meet you and Bly.  I'm not sure, but I think yours was the only muskie caught all week!  You are right in that the meal was wonderful, and that the music that followed was a fitting end to another great OFC Lakair event."
87648,Tarzan's Jane,2007-06-25 21:55:00,1183,Great report and pics - glad to hear you not only did fantastic with the fishing but also in making new friends.  Bet you'll plan for a little longer stay next year.
87685,crappiesteve,2007-06-25 23:18:00,220,"Cliff,I still say you have a horse shoe  Was great to meet you and Carole,that muskie was a bonus,till next year.You can go carpping now LOL.  Steve"
87695,Clampet,2007-06-25 23:35:00,1947,"Glad to see you were able to make it! There's a lot of history in that area.  Lake Nipissing figured prominently with French fur traders as a 'highway' plied with their birch bark canoes. Imagine what the fishing might have been like, say 300 years ago!"

Thanks everyone for your comments...it was truly an unforgettable experience, and anyone who was on the fence on coming out, I urge you to go next year!!!"
87156,OhioFisherman,2007-06-25 00:31:00,6623,Great pictures and report! Nice to hear everyone had a good time!
87158,Gerritt,2007-06-25 00:32:00,6129,"Glad to see you guys made it home and had a a great time with the remainder of your weekend! It was my pleasure to have the both of you aboard my tin can, and you are more then welcome  anytime! Dont believe everything they tell you about me... as it is probably true! LOL..  But seriously it was my pleasure to spend a few, albeit short hours with the both of you. I just wished the winds had died down a bit so we could spend a bit more time on the water.. but that north wind on the way back to my lodge was BRUTAL! to say the least LOL..  As for the fishing... I was trying my Walleye spots at first but I think the combination of the clod front and it being the middle of the afternoon hindered our chances a bit... so off for pike it was!...dang.. could get any of them either... shallow calm bays, weeds and rock structure.. I could'nt buy a fish that afternoon... I was started to get frustrated.. and I said I have one more card up my sleeves lets see what kind of trouble we could get into... Man was I relieved to see Cliff nail a healthy Muskie! it took my frustration away and brought a smile to everyones face!  If anyone here gets a chance to fish w/ Cliff and Carole RUN... Dont Walk at the chance... better people you will not find.  Glad to hear you had a great outing. I was happy to be a small part of it.  Gerritt."
