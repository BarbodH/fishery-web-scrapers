87285,thecraftyprince,2007-06-25 12:32:00,37,"Man did that fly by fast ! Due to family commitments I was unable to make it up for the weekend but couldn't let the event pass by with a no show so I headed up during the week to get in a couple of days with the gang.  Wednesday afternoon Kevin invited Don, Chuck and myself to have a look at the walleye pond that so many of us have heard about .    Quite the ingenious setup.    Wednesday evening I headed out with Shelley and Chuck (ladywalleye & bigchevy4x4) for some west arm walleye, the fishing gods smiled on us and we were rewarded with several fish, four of which were invited to breakfast the next morning.  Here's ladywalleye working her culinary magic.    Mmmmm, walleye !!    Here's a shot of Tent City before the masses arrived on friday.    Biteme and his buddy came up wednesday night and decided to visit campsites instead of fishing, those that have been to Lakair before can appreciate this, this is my third year and I fish less every year. lol Their plan was to get a good nights sleep and hit it hard in the morning. I believe the exact words were, "" WE're gonna hit it hard tomorrow, all day !! You're making the sandwhiches !!  I don't know what was in those sandwiches but ....    Here's a sunset shot that looks right out of ""Lord of the Rings""    Well the fishing was good and the company even better, can't wait till next year."
