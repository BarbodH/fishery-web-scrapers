Got there around 5:30 or so this morning and the water was like glass.... sun just coming up, so I tied on a topwater bait and tried to get my first topwater fish.  A few casts later and the water around my lure explodes.... kind of startled me at first... a quick fight and I had my first topwater largemouth, a fish about 12"" or so long.  Tied on a bubblegum coloured senko (had to try them out after seeing all the talk about them) and started walking and casting.  Over the next few hours nailed another 3 largies, all around 10-12"" and 2 hammerhandle pike.  It started heating up and I decided it was time to leave.  No pics since I don't have a digital camera yet.  Thanks for reading...hope to have more reports coming!"

87497,jediangler,2007-06-25 17:57:00,1923,Congrats on your topwater largie. How are the weeds at the Berg right now? I usually steer clear a couple weeks after pike opens.
87599,addict,2007-06-25 20:02:00,475,sounds like a fun time.to bad that damn sun gets so hot.
87606,Carp,2007-06-25 20:15:00,1488,"Nice shooting SBR. I pass that reservoir very often, but never thought to stop in and wet a line."
87746,SBCregal,2007-06-26 01:19:00,688,"Thanks guys!  jediangler, the water was pretty low and there was weeds everywhere. I've only been there once before (late last summer) and the water was lower than it was then."
87750,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-26 01:23:00,0,Sounds like you caught some fish and hade some fun. Good job!
87780,mason05,2007-06-26 01:59:00,258,Nice job SBC.  There are some good size bass in there.  Keep at it with the top water action.  I too got my first topwater bass last night just south of you in mountsberg creek.  Nice report.  Corn Nug
