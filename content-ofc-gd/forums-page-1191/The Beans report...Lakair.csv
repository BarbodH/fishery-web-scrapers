87749,Beans,2007-06-26 01:23:00,3339,After a very enjoyable drive up to Lakair with my pal Jack (Nanook) I bunked in with Maureen (my daughter) for three nights in cabin #6 at the top of the hill...  here are a few pics I took:  Maureen enjoying life...   Shelley taking a pic of me taking a pic of her...   And a few random shots:   
87758,Beans,2007-06-26 01:33:00,3339,      I thought I had a shot of Crappy Steve winning the Lakair Lodge donated prize but I guess I was laughing so much I missed taking one...  I don't know how Spiel can concentrate on fishing with Steve in his boat...what a hoot...Nanook was right...he does remind me of Jerry Colona...  Sorry I didn't take many more pics but those that met me know that I was too busy talking their heads off to take pictures

87917,Entropy,2007-06-26 12:59:00,747,"Ok, so where is this place again?  I think next year I might be in order for me to join you guys.  Can my wife come too?  Cost? Dates for next year?  Is it during the week?  Entropy"
87920,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 13:02:00,7971," It's on the west arm of Lake Nipissing.  The main event is on a Saturday....but people go up before hand or stay the following week as well.  Prices vary from camping to cottages.  Check out their website at www.lakair.com  Not sure about dates yet, but I'm told it's usually around the same time every year in June."
