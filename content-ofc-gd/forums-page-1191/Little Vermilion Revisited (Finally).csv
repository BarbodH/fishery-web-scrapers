87093,Moosebunk,2007-06-24 17:54:00,3970,"Now, had that been me I'd be grinning from ear to ear in most of those pics.  But that's me.  Couple old pros like yourselves appear to take it as just another day at the office.   Must be the ""Fury"" in your fishing.  Two thumbs up doods.  Great report.  Great success on the pike.  I too am a big fan of the inlines for pike, and hope to show ya's in the coming weeks with a couple pike of my own."
