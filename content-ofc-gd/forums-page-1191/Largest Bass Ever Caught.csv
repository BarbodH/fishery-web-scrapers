However she released the fish and basically through away the chance of winning 8 million dollars.    WOW that must hurt big time.

88158,carp-starter,2007-06-26 22:42:00,253,"The lady may have lost a lot of money by releasing her bass.  What would you have done? Or what would you do if you already had your limit and you caught your ""world record fish""?  Here is a thread about a ""what if"" situation.  What if you caught a world record and you already had 3 keepers http://www.thebassbarn.com/forum/showthread.php?t=98395  carp-starter"
88163,mepps,2007-06-26 22:54:00,1301,"this one is 25 lbs..  ""The bass weighed 25 pounds, 1 ounce on a hand-held scale, which â€“ if approved â€“ would shatter the world record, the 22-pound, 4-ounce bass caught by George W. Perry at Montgomery Lake in Georgia in 1932."" "
