Are there any places you guys would reccomend? I might stay at the Elora Gorge conservation area, I am there all the time to kayak the rapids (obviously I wont be going that far in my canoe!!).  Anywhere really between or around Kitchener and Elora would be perfect."
88044,jediangler,2007-06-26 18:03:00,1923,"There is an outfitter in Kitchener that specializes in canoe trips on the Grand. Even if you don't use him, his maps and distances might be of some use to you.  http://www.canoeingthegrand.ca  On Sunday I did a kayak trip from the bridge in Bridgeport to the bridge in Freeport. It took 8 hrs because we stopped to fish every fishy looking spot. We did meet a bunch of people (about 8 canoes) who were in the middle of their trip from Elora to Paris. The water is very low now and will only be getting lower unless we get some rain this week. My report from Sunday is back a few pages if you're interested."
88049,Victor,2007-06-26 18:19:00,1609,i have never done a canoe trip on the Grand but i have been fishing the bridgeport area quite a bit from shore lately. The water levels have been down low since mid May and hasn't gone up ...
88285,DannyBoy17,2007-06-27 04:33:00,3,Why did I put an E on Grand? Oh well.  So the levels are low eh? What should I be looking to fish for?
