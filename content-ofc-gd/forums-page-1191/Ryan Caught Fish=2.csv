87659,Mike the Pike,2007-06-25 22:14:00,3421,With Holiday Monday I headed down the 401 to join my frequent fishing partner Kenny at his cottage In Lancaster Ontario we took his boat.thought we would go fishing in Ontario knowing that most of you would be at work   and we could count on low boat traffic because of it  .I think Ontario was fished out this weekend.Might have to do with all the excitement from Lakair  Strange day our usual honey holes were not producing  Could have been the cold front.(Ya I know just another excuse)I pitched everthing in my box for bass and Pike.Well kenny and I got the skunk and my young son reminded us that he caught 2 fish a Rock Bass and a Perch.Little bugger rubbed it in all the way home.  Not much of a report and it does not even compare to some of the Lakair Reports but once again it was about keeping my youngster hooked on fishing.  Next Stop Bay of Quinte next weekend wooooooooo hoooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!  MTP    Woke up at the usual Lew oclock.   On our way out Captain Kenny and the real fisherman         Too much Casting takes its toll.  MTP

At least your son still got into some fish....all these great memories are building up, and he'll truly appreciate them as he gets older.  You know he'll be sitting around a campfire at some point with his high school/university buddies and telling stories about fishing with his Dad.  THAT'S what it's all about!!"
