Anyways, our club decided to have a fun open tournament and headed out for a small 7am - 1pm tournament.  The morning was slow, and we didnt have a fish in the boat until almost 10:30 (lost 3, broke off 3.... not a good start) however, once we got that first one, the action heated up.  Senkos (Steve's Mustard made by ghostbaits.com), chatterbaits and smoke tubes were our baits of choice today.  We ended up landing about a dozen keepers, and kept our biggest five for the tournament.  We weighed in at 14.10 and placed 3rd.  Winners had 18.8 pounds.  After the tournament, a fellow competitors boat and I decided to go back out and try and pick up some more fish for the fun of it.  Well, speaking of pick up, thats just what the wind did, and in turn, so did the spinnerbait bite!!!   Brent with one of our culled fish   Brent with another culled fish.   Aaron and Sarah with their 4th place bag of 13.35 pounds   Brent and I with our 3rd place bag   Bill with his 2nd place bag of 14.65 pounds   Scott and his partner with their bag of 18.80 pounds.  THE AFTERMATH  nice spinnerbait smallie   Pike to add to the mix   One bruiser, and one big one haha.   Aaron with a PIG 6 pound smallie."
