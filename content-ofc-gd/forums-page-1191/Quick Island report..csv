87846,Jonaton,2007-06-26 05:37:00,72,"  So a friend and I headed down to the islands to see if we could find some bass for the opener. We spent about 6 hours down there and not even a sniff of a bass.  The pike however were everywhere, I have never seen so many fish, at one point by sight I saw 4 just sunning them selves in 4-6 feet of water. We mush have seen 12-15 fish, noyt including the carp which were there in ridiculous numbers, why don't I fish for carp again?They however were uncooperative, you could literally bounce baits off of their noses and they wouldnt even move. There was one fish there that I thought was a carp at first but was in fact a pike. It was by far the biggest pike I have even seen in person and must have been a 20+ lb fish. Ater my friend caught the one fish for the day I spent a good 20 minutes trying to get this fish to bite, but it just wanted no part of it. I swear the fish kept looking at me and mocking me. Anyways even though I got skunked it was still a great day,other than the severe sunburn I got, I really have to put the sunblock IN my fishing bag."

87889,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 12:07:00,7971,Great report!!!  I know the feeling about fish mocking you...happens to me all the time!! LOL.  Good on you for getting out there though.  Any day fishing is never a waste...even if you get skunked.  I learn the most about fishing on those days.
87897,007,2007-06-26 12:20:00,537,Better luck next time with the bass.  Nice pike though.  There are lots of fish at the islands but finding them and then getting them to bite can be challenging - I know from experience.  007
