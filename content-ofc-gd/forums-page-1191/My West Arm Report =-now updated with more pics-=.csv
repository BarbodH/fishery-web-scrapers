86984,Gerritt,2007-06-24 03:28:00,6129,"Well I finally have a few moments to myself to sit and reflect on the week and to post a bunch of pictures..  First I will start off the weather was battling us all week, High winds and ALOT of rain, but when it was safe to get out we did  We once again stayed @ Welcome Lodge for the 5th year in a row, Gray and Angela are great hosts.. thanks for another memorable week!  This year the fishing was a little different as we had the Slot to deal with... no matter we not meat hunters anyways... just enough for a nice meal is all I was interested in, out of 200 fish caught between the 3 of us only 4 went into into the pan feeding 6 people  We did well in terms of numbers with ALOT of fish caught in the slot the biggest was a 21"" that came in on #5 Perch ShadRap what we lacked in terms of size was easily made up in terms of numbers of fish. I dont have very many Walleye pictures due to the rains we were experiencing on what seemed like an almost daily basis, However I do have a ton more shots coming as my brother in-law took alot of shots of me holding up our catch on his cam... I will post them shortly when I receive them  Here are a couple pictures of the weather we experianced      we caught a ton of fish in this size range.. I am assuming this is either a 1 year or 2 year class fish...A testament stocking efforts are helping the walleye fishery  This one measured just over 13""    Then there were a bunch of these fellas caught too!     Here are a few shots of some of the wildlife up there     And these shots are my favourite, what a proud father I am! Ladies and Gentlemen.... We have a new RockBass Champion!   He was nailing em' Liam is 22mths old and this was the first time I could really fish with him as he is able to better communicate with me etc.... it was priceless.. ""Daddy, Fish Wawa"" (wawa = Water) he wanted them put back into the water... Already a C&R fisherman!            After a while he got a little bored and decided this would be WAY more fun!    He also LOVES the boat! man is he gonna make a wicked fishing partner!       Now its time for a little R&R!!       After a hard days fishing he does like we all do...falls asleep at his table....     On Friday I headed over to see the guys at Lakair Spent a couple hours fishing with Spiel and CrappieSteve (Sorry I didnt make it to the fishfry Kevin!) then I had the pleasure of having Cliff and Carole in my boat for a couple hours   Wow are they great people friendly easy going and great to waste some time with!  I will be adding a ton more fishing picture tomorrow once they are all emailed to me..... All in all a fantastic week!   Gerritt."

87042,mepps,2007-06-24 13:40:00,1301,great photos! I cant wait until the day I teach my son to fish!
87046,Carp,2007-06-24 14:05:00,1488,Fantastic report Gerritt. I'm sure it was a thrill to fish with the little guy. I always have a great time when the kids are with me. Seeing the look of joy and exitement on their faces when we get a fish is priceless.  The begining of many father/son trips for you I'm sure. Thanks for sharing.
87052,Jen,2007-06-24 14:41:00,833,"Weather not being on your side, it looks as if you made the very best of all the good moments.  Liam is absolutely beautiful, and seems to be at ease around water.  You both looked so relaxed... When my boys were his age, I can remember never being able to take my hand off of them while out on a dock...the moment I did they would fall in.  Now days they do the same but usually its from one pushing the other.  You look happy Gerritt and that is truly what vacations are all about... may the peace and tranquility you found while up in gods land stay with you for a long time.  Cheers,  Jen  P.S.  Was that a bald eagle nesting on the hydro pole?"
87054,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-24 15:01:00,1351,"very cute kid there gerrit... great pics, i wish i could have a fishign partner like that one day.  but no fish for team 3?? lol all's good!"
87063,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-24 15:21:00,0,Excellant report!Looks like you guys were slayin em!That does look like some nasty weather. I am surprised the big Musky didn't come out to play!  I'd rather have bad weather and catch fish than good weather and get skunked!!!

Perfect netting job from my FIL...    The quarry...    The release...    one of the many caught...    and another..     Expect more to come!  Gerritt."

Thanks for asking,  Gerritt."
87151,ccmtcanada,2007-06-25 00:29:00,7971,"Wow Gerritt!!  Awesome report...cant complain that you didn't catch any fish!! LOL.  Those pics with your son are priceless.

Seeing some of those pics sure brought back memories of past trips up to welcome lodge.  The Osprey nest....the cabins and dock in the backgound....the bouy, etc.  I hope to make it back there again someday, as Gary and Angela are top notch hosts who really care about their guests.
