87895,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 12:17:00,7971,"SWEEEET report!!!  Even though you didn't get your bass, I'm sure you're ecstatic about your day on the water!!!  I'd love to hook into ANY fish that size, but to get a muskie is pure bonus.  Great work and great pics!!"
88035,Lefty,2007-06-26 17:30:00,14,Great fish!!  Thanks for sharing.  L.
88037,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 17:33:00,455,"Wow   Those are some beautiful fish that you caught! I hope I catch something even close to that, I love it up in the Ottawa Valley!   Great job and I am glad to see that you had a great time!"
87381,Seaweed,2007-06-25 14:44:00,135,Well I hit the river today to try to land some opening day bass.  Got this nice Pike early in the day on a frog.    Worked all day trying to find a bass.  None.  On my last spot I hit the jackpot.  Surprise!    Supertanker Alert!    My all time big fish all 54 inches of her.  Amazing fight... I had to beach the boat to release her..... she still swims.  What a surprise on opening day for bass.  Go figure.    I'm all smiles for sure
87385,dustink,2007-06-25 14:47:00,526,WOW!!!!  Just awesome pic....congrats!  
87387,tbayboy,2007-06-25 14:50:00,1497,Wow thats one long toothy bass   .  Congrats on the monster and thanks for the great pics.

87413,OhioFisherman,2007-06-25 15:32:00,6623,Nice fish! I can`t do that when I am trying!
87434,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-25 16:02:00,1351,"i'd say, monster musky is an understatement.. very nice fish!"
87435,Entropy,2007-06-25 16:06:00,747,Nice surprise for sure.
87449,Whopper,2007-06-25 16:31:00,2174,Awesome! love the release shot.  If that was me I would have had to go in waist deep so no one could tell I messed my self  Congrats  Whopper
87473,Seaweed,2007-06-25 17:29:00,135,I'm still vibrating.  Freaking hard to believe still.  I don't know how Pete Mania does those shots holding big muskie  I couldn't control this fish enough to hold her up out of the water and as you can tell I'm no slouch and a big ole boy.
87481,Zeynex,2007-06-25 17:40:00,6,"Wow, great fish ! Congrats ! Think of the how many guys wanted to land a Muskie of that size.    -RJ"
87532,solopaddler,2007-06-25 18:44:00,8605,"Amazing, fish of a lifetime for most!"
87534,Doctrt,2007-06-25 18:45:00,141,Sweet Ski!  Congrats! T
87539,Zamboni,2007-06-25 18:51:00,235,"WOW, congrats on a great catch.  I launch at Grenville (across from Hawksbury) and fish the Ottawa once or twice a year-we have a cottage in Laurentians. Never seen Muskie over 48""'s in that section of Ottawa-hear they exist. Without giving too much info out which general area were you in?  Just got my hands on Ottawa River charts this weekend, might pull boat to a business meeting in Orleans coming up."
87540,Seaweed,2007-06-25 18:57:00,135,The fish was caught and released around Petrie Island.  There are a few beach goers that might not be swimming there anymore now that they have seen that fish.  I would gladly hook up with anyone who would like to fish the area if you are around just let me know.  It would be a great place for a get-together too.
87543,Hellfish,2007-06-25 19:04:00,308,That sure is a trophy i would have got the measurements and make a mount 4 sureeeeee!
87588,addict,2007-06-25 19:51:00,475,nice lunge.its always nice when the fish gods give up a beauty at the end of a hard day.
87627,Carp,2007-06-25 20:52:00,1488,That's a funny looking bass you're holding.  Beauty catch Seaweed. I wish one day the fishing gods will allow me to borrow one of their huge ski creatures for a photo too.
87632,mepps,2007-06-25 21:20:00,1301,wow!! great musky!
87662,fishinfool,2007-06-25 22:19:00,366,"Wow, truly a fish of a lifetime. WTG seaweed!!! Hope to get one like that myself one day. Congrats."
87665,Jigger,2007-06-25 22:28:00,1237,"That is a very, very nice surprise! Congrats on that one, alot of guys will never come close to a fish that size. WTG!"
87667,motv8tr,2007-06-25 22:36:00,2587,"wow, that's one heck of a Musky!!!  congrats !  Maureen"
