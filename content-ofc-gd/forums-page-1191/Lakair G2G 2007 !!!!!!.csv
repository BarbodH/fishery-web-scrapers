87096,ChrisK,2007-06-24 18:21:00,2772,"Just wanted to let you all know that the G2G at Lakair went as scheduled and turned out to be possibly one of our best ever. Great times had by all with a bonus shore lunch fish fry on Tombstone Island in West Bay put on by our host kevin Cameron otherwise known as Captain Hooked and yours truly Muskiestudd Friday afternoon.  We had a great turn out at the pike derby and incredibly enough Rick Obanion took the trophy and a Garmin GPS with most accumilated inches in total and myself taking the big fish of the day which rewarded me with Speils donation which was a Minn Kotta electric trolling motor  ..... There were many other prizes handed out and a Lakair trip raffled off as well....... Soooooo,I would like to invite all who were involved to chime in with there pictures and stories of the G2G event...This should be good......"

87176,SlowPoke,2007-06-25 01:19:00,2984,"Thanks everyone for the kind remarks and taking the time to post them. It was my first Lakair trip and certainly not my last. In fact, I might do it again this year. If you've never been you owe it to yourself to go. We had outstanding weather all week but even if it rained, I would have enjoyed my stay just as much.  Most rewarding was the one-on-one conversations. There were too many too mention without leaving somebody out but I learned a lot about life, fishing and way more than I needed to know about Alabama goats.  There was indeed a muskie caught but I'll leave it up them to post a report.  -Brian"
