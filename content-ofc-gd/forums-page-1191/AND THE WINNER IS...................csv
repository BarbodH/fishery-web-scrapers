87334,capt_hooked,2007-06-25 13:55:00,212,"I am proud to annouce that Doug with a big ""G"" won the TV - at last nite's dinner (thank you Joe and Mule!) to raise funds for our walleye stocking efforts.  Congrats DougG...  its in the back of DEG's van as we speak .... heading south.. special delivery!  Thankyou to everyone who generously donated to our walleye stocking program.  Our program can only continue with the help of our volunteers who give a couple hours of their time each Sunday afternoon (and sometimes a few extra days here and there) and funding, which is mostly provided by private donations and from local groups such as the Noelville Rod and Gun Club.. much appreciated.  Unfortunately, this year, no funds were available from the MNR out of North Bay.  In 2006, our group (Vacation Land 64 Walleye Hatchery and the South Shore Associatin)  suscessfully released 78,000 fingerings into Lake Nipissing. In additon we are experimenting with raising fall fingerlings (up to 7-inches) in the hope that we can tag these larger fall fish in order to gain valuable information in coming years as these fish mature and are recaptured by anglers."

As for Doug winning the TV, I'm not sure the right guy won. Knowing Doug, he'll probably only use the parts to make a high definition toaster or something."
