87894,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 12:15:00,7971,Mike....yet another awesome report!  The scenery where your reports are from are simply breathtaking.  You always get into great fish and tell great stories in your reports.  Congrats on a great outing!
87914,Entropy,2007-06-26 12:56:00,747,Do you like the Sportspal better then the one you were using?  Entropy
87958,solopaddler,2007-06-26 15:00:00,8605," They're both about the same as far as stability goes. The other one had more comfortable seats and is virtually indestructable, but the Sportspal is 50lb's lighter. Beyond spending 2-3K on a kevlar squareback of some kind, it's the lightest squareback canoe available. So yeah, I like the Sportspal better. You've just got to be careful with it as it's not quite as tough as other boats."
87965,tonyb,2007-06-26 15:16:00,1637,"Solo, normally I wouldn't admit to being friends with him in public ... just kidding.  Actually I am surprised he still wants to talk to me after we took him on a death walk on Simcoe in the winter (6kms + in deep snow - still got skunked).  We had him believing we were in kahoots with his wife for his life insurance policy  I think he is crazy for trying to get into politics, but I have to hand it to him he does put his money where his mouth is when it comes to conservation work.  I'm sure we'll meet on the water someday  Tony"
88064,aniceguy,2007-06-26 18:53:00,1094,"UGGGGH  Tony lets not mention that walk out on Simcoe that day......Aaron has some pretty good stamina for makin that walk........My wife ehhhh   arent you in the midst of doing home renovations........  That day was fun though, watchin the hut fill up with water on 14 of ice.........."
87329,solopaddler,2007-06-25 13:47:00,8605,"Headed north last Wednesday with a buddy for a few days of fishin'. Most of these trips it's nothing but work, so I was really looking forward to this one! On the way up I stopped in at the Sportspal factory in North Bay and picked up a 16' transom model for fishing the back lakes around my place.  They installed a carrying yoke for me while I waited, (free of charge!)  Managed to get it on the Honda with no problems and we were off!  After arriving late Wed. afternoon, we downed a few drinks, had dinner and managed to get out fishing right at dusk. I managed 1 decent walleye before fatigue set in...  The next day we decided to take it easy and fish my lake. It was a good choice, we hammered the walleye!       That night we had a huge fish fry, decided to try beer batter and it was really good!  The next day we headed to one of my favourite back lakes for the day. You actually have to navigate up a little creek to access the lake...   Once we arrived we were somewhat hampered by the high winds. My bud Andrew is a massive guy, and he wasn't overly comfortable in the canoe especially with the high winds so we were pretty much stuck fishing sheltered spots like the backside of islands in the lee of the wind. We did okay anyway    Andrew had this very nice walleye in the 5lb class right up to the canoe and ended up losing it, it spit the hooks.   At one point the wind became too much so we beached the canoe and walked around one of the islands casting from shore. That was a blast actually as we caught a pile of decent sized smallmouth. Here's Andrew fighting one..  We weren't really targeting pike, but man, you wouldn't believe the numbers we caught! None were huge (3-5lb's), but they were hitting like crazy! Numerous multiple double headers were had, so it was definitely a lot of fun. Here's Andrew with the only pike shot I took, typical size of the maybe 60 we landed (although he's trying real hard to make it look bigger LOL!)  That evening while relaxing on the deck I snapped a pic of this floatplane landing right in front of my place. Thought it was kinda cool...  The next day we fished my lake again, we just didn't have it in us to possibly battle the high winds again in the canoe. Anyhow, it was a great day with a bunch of quality fish caught.     Had a great bbq Sat night to cap off a perfect day. Sunday we packed up early to head home as we were both anxious to spend some time with our families, so no fishing. It was a fantastic trip, although the weather was extremely unstable and cool (actually had frost Friday night!). Next up is the family vacation up there in 2 weeks, can't wait!  cheers,  Mike"

87423,wallacio,2007-06-25 15:48:00,475,Great pics Mike - I wish that I could have gone!   I'll definitely get up there with you sometime soon.    How did you ever convince Andrew to get into a canoe???
87436,Whopper,2007-06-25 16:08:00,2174,Good deal Mike!  Glad to see I'm not the only one that doesn't color coordinate jig & twister combos  Thanks  Whopper
87442,solopaddler,2007-06-25 16:21:00,8605," Hey Dave, nice to see you chime in bud, hope things are going well with you! Actually, that Sportspal is pretty stable. If it wasn't for the high wind everything would have been fine. In any case if you ever get a free pass for 4 days off let me know and we'll plan something."
87446,aniceguy,2007-06-25 16:27:00,1094,  Nice Mike all I can say very nice indeed.  Sorry I missed it......I was thinking the same.  It would have been worth the trip just to see Andrew in a canoe...Eh Dave.....always a great report
87451,Golfisher,2007-06-25 16:33:00,586,What a trip!  Is it just me or did anyone else also notice Bill Clinton in the pictures?

87462,solopaddler,2007-06-25 16:56:00,8605," Next time let's try and get on the same page, plan something well in advance, and all head up together. It would be a blast!"
