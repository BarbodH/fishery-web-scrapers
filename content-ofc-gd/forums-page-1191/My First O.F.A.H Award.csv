87797,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 02:34:00,455,"Well I made a post a couple of weeks ago about that great chinook salmon that I caught on Lake Ontario with Shawn and his friend. I entered that beauty to team 9 and then I enterd the OFAH award program for the very first time. Well four days later I got my award for the salmon along with my decal   It is my very first award that I ever recieved for fishing and I will be entering more this year. My aim is to get 5 species out of ten to get the special award, but even if I don't reach my goal at least I have this which I am going to frame very soon!   Thanks FOTB and Fishindevil for reminding me about the OFAH award program.    "

88239,solopaddler,2007-06-27 01:33:00,8605,"Congrat's! (Man, what I would give if my wife would get excited over an OFAH award  )"
88246,fishergirl72,2007-06-27 01:51:00,455," I know what you mean, when I was all in awe over that award, Fishindevil just looked at me wondering why.LOL, it has many more but to a woman, it is different, it is a accomplishment over a sport."
88256,solopaddler,2007-06-27 02:06:00,8605," No, I get that, and it is an accomplishment  . What I mean is, that I love my wife dearly and she's got some amazing qualities, but while she enjoys the outdoors and fishing, she'll never love it enough to enter a fish for an award let alone join and participate in fishing message board. In a male dominated sport that's very cool to see. Kudos to you and all the other female members of the board  ."
88258,fishergirl72,2007-06-27 02:10:00,455," Thanks solopaddler, I knew what you meant and that is what I was trying to say, along those lines but you said it better.LOL"
