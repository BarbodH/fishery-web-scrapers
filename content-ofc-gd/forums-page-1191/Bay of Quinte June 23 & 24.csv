Saturday was a fun day but was spent catching alot of fish from shallow matt flats and also some deeper weed lines.  Largest of the day was a 4.55lb bucket and a total weight of 13.70 lbs.  We were in 42nd spot after day 1. We then managed to have a great day on day 2 with the 2nd largest bag of the day at 18.76 pounds. We had 2 fish over 5lbs in our 5 fish limit. We moved to 11th place overall, we took 1st place in the 115hp and under division, won big fish with a 5.45lb bucket and also tied for overall big fish for both days.  It was a great to finally get out and pound the bass.  We caught well over 30 fish over the 2 days.  The BOQ is truly a great fishery.  The best patterns were deep weedlines in 8-10ft of water using Phenix Craws and Tubes on Fin Tech Title Shot jigs in 1/2 and 3/4 oz.  In the shallows is where all our big fish came and the secret was to find blow in close to deeper flats.  In these areas we managed our 4 biggest fish of the 2 days.  It was incredible hooking these big fish and fighting them through all that heavy cover.  For gear I was using Shimano Crucial flipping sticks and also a 7ft Heavy Crucial casting rods with the Shimano High Speed Curado spooled with 50lb FINS PRT Braid.  The magic bait in the shallows was a Phenix Chubby Worm ( similar to a senko but slower fall pegged with a 1/8oz Tru-tungsten worm weight.  We also managed other fish on spinnerbaits in white and chartreuse, top waters, shallow crankbaits.  Here is a picture of the one bass weighing 5.45lbs.  "
