I get the brakes fixed,siezed adjusters, clean everything up,and says no charge and if I need anything else done let him know. For that He gets added to the sponsor list and an advert on the truck.      Others    TNT has been there since the pro/ams.    On my way home after that I say to myself,self,I got to do something about these sun faded trailer fenders. I stop by the local body shop supplier and he hooks me up and what a nice job and shine.  Also picked up a scratch remover  for the boat.Look,n good    Ok, so now everything is good to go for the weekend,Im jacked as jacked can be and I hope I can atleast get a few winks of shut eye tonight.
