88093,lilkynan,2007-06-26 19:50:00,173,Welcome Lodge    Just wondering if there was any feed back on this lodge - taking the family - wife and two kids 8 and 9 years. Is there anything extra recomended to bring there?  Also if anyone has any fishing tips for the area?  Thanks

What cottage are you staying in? I have pretty much been in all of them having rents two at a time for the past few years...I have a ton of spots I have done well at, and that should put you on fish...  Do you have Google Earth installed? if so I will send you a file that should help out...  Here is a hint.... #5 Shad Raps In BlueGill, Perch and Bass... I assume your bringing a boat? I have a few decent trolling spots for you then as well... I have been fishing The West Arm of Nipissing for awhile, and I have been @ Welcome Lodge for the previous five years... Gary and Angela are great hosts!  If you want a pm me with what you are targeting etc... and I will be certain to give you as much info as I can muster.  Gerritt."
