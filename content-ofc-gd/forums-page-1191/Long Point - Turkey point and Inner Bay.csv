87507,kennyman,2007-06-25 18:12:00,737,"I've launched out of Old Cut a few times (if you can call it launching with my twelve foot tinny LOL). It's not fancy there, but it's a relaxed atmosphere, they're decent people and they have good minnows too!"
87513,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-06-25 18:21:00,34,I have never heard of Old Cut?  Can you give me more details. Is this close to the inner bays?
87570,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-06-25 19:39:00,34,"What are you throwing in the inner bay? Mostly tubes, spinners, or live bait?  I cant wait"
87580,SlowPoke,2007-06-25 19:44:00,2984,I much prefer the Long Point Provincial Park ramp. Last year it was $9 and an excellent ramp with a cleaning station and lots of parking.
87622,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-06-25 20:42:00,34,Thanks I think i will give that a try
87796,kennyman,2007-06-26 02:33:00,737,"We were using minnows (which mostly caught perch), caught a pike on a blue/chrome ripplin redfin and bass were caught on perch patterned lipless crankbaits, one was Matzuo which I lost and the other is a cordell super spot in firetiger. We tried throwing a spinner bait, but strangely, no takers. Good luck."
