775160,duxbware,2013-03-22 13:51:00,102,"Good morning,  My wife just surprised the hell out of me and said I can book a family fishing vacation this August. We have two boys 6 and 4. They enjoy outdoors and fishing. My wife, she will fish but is not thrilled about it.  My question to all of you is, where should we go? I would like to have the following:  - One boat so we all could stay together (16ft) -Clean and well kept cabin, firdge stove....... - Other things to do besides fishing, ( a town or somewhere that we can day trip to) - A beach or a place to swim - Great fishing for walleye, pike ect....  This is our first family trip and want to make it enjoyable for all. We enjoy fishing but can't do it all day for a week ( even though I could)  I don't mind driving 6-8 hours, I plan on driving through the night so the boys can sleep. Any suggestions would be great.  Thanks.  D."

775179,SirWhite,2013-03-22 15:43:00,210,Sounds like Lake Simcoe is what you need. Theres are a few cottages for rent in Georgina and one near the narrows that have boats included. I rent with my family at least twice a year. Simcoe is great for the kids and Orillia / Barrie is good for day excursions. Good luck
775185,duxbware,2013-03-22 16:19:00,102,"Thanks for the suggestion Sirwhite. I was hoping to go further north. I want the boys to experence the ""real north"" for the first time. I understand the day trip thing is going to be tuff to find but I don't want to turn them off of fishing at a young age. However if they are catching a bunch of fish that may be a different story. Maybe a hike to an old gold mine or something....."
775199,Hedfish,2013-03-22 18:20:00,76,"Lots of cottages on Lake Nipissing and not too expensive. Sudbury and North Bay are relatively nearby with some interesting stuff to do for kids there (the old nickel (?) mine in Sudbury comes to mind), lots of farms too.  With 6 and 4 year olds I wouldn't target pikes and walleyes though. IMO if you want to keep them interested in the hobby, at that age they need faster action and panfish is ideal for that.  And I wouldn't plan for a whole day fishing trip either, they get bored within a couple of hours at that age. What worked for us was finding some remote little island and having a picnic there plus swimming, etc. If you come up with some various activities like that, your family will have a blast during that day outdoors.  [edit] Oh and you better book about now - they get booked fast. You can still find cottages at a week's notice if someone cancels but it's harder to plan if you don't book ahead of time, since you never what, when and where will become available."
775202,TJQ,2013-03-22 18:51:00,7806,Ya Port Loring - Nipissing even Marten River will do ya . fine.. stay with targeting panfish for the kids keep them interested!!
775203,kickingfrog,2013-03-22 18:51:00,8333,Can't offer much for specifics but Temagami might be another area to consider.
775219,kenzy31,2013-03-22 21:07:00,261,"Point Au Baril area is really nice. Lots of resort cottages like you're looking for, tons of scenery, good fishing for bass and panfish that time of year too. You've also got Parry Sound close and so is Killbear for day trips.  I took my wife to Rock Pine Resort last year and we had a great weekend. Solid, reliable boat packages with 16 footers and Yammy's.  They had a fantastic beach area too! We went around pike opener but with the early warm weather we couldn't key in on a pattern in 2 days.  We got a few plus a handful of really nice OOS bass.  Check out that area, you might find something that suits your family's needs.  Cheers, Jesse"
775228,chris.brock,2013-03-22 22:01:00,4053,"Chapleau Lodge on Borden Lake near Chapleau, would give the family a feeling of being way up north, plus they've got a heated (wood), outdoor pool for the kids, about 8 hours drive  daytrips- Chapleau (obviously) - Chapleau dump (aka bear city) for wildlife viewing - Chapleau game preserve  http://www.chapleaulodge.com/"
775232,limeyangler,2013-03-22 22:19:00,5204,Damn....too far away again.  I know a lake or 2 up here where you could get a pike a cast all day on nothing more than a Mepps #3. (not huge pike...but kids would have a blast!)
775233,Rizzo,2013-03-22 22:25:00,4754,"We spent a week on Pigeon last year on the east side near Peterborough, place called Cadigans Camp. Cottages were ""rustic"" but they had a nice beach for the kids, and you are close to Peterborough where there is lots to do, including a free zoo/splash pad. Me and my buddy fished a couple of hours a day and nailed a few muskies, and in the heat of the day we'd take the kids out and catch all kinds of panfish. One night we took the kids for an overnight  camping trip on Big Island. We felt it was a good ""family"" vacation with a bit of fishing thrown in for the dads early am and late  pm"
775249,Musky or Specks,2013-03-22 23:52:00,2710,Fellow Kitchener ite here. Lake Restoule is an excellent choice. http://www.duenorth.net/martinscamp/ Fishing is decent Town is within walking distance. Lots of trails. North Bay is a nice Day trip
775281,bow slayer,2013-03-23 04:41:00,1074,"I would second Restoule. I have been vacationing there for over 20 years now,including last 18 with kids.Never rented a cottage but there is Eckford's camp and Martin's camp. Not sure what is happening with Martins i know Bing(owner) had it up for sale last summer,but I am sure it will be operating. Both rent  cottages,boats,canoes and sell bait. Martins has the only gas available on the lake. Fishing is good for walleye,bass,pike,lake trout, whitefish ,also stormy and restoule lakes have plenty of very large musky.Several back lakes in the area offer good bass,pike,specks and walleye fishing. As for day trips North Bay(shopping,parks ,waterfront,cruises) is only 40 minutes away,Mattawa an hour and there is Restoule Provincial Park which has beaches,bike rentals,picnic area and some good hiking trails. All about 5 hours away."
775295,duxbware,2013-03-23 13:51:00,102,Thanks for the replies and Pm's guys. Some great suggestions and I will look into all of them. Has anyone ever been to Horwood Lake lodge? Some feed back would be great. Kids under six are free there!!! I want to make sure there is lots of stuff for the boys to do. The website says they have wolf calling.

775345,wildeye rainbow,2013-03-24 01:12:00,123,"I have been taking the fam to Dry Pine Resort on the French River the last 15 years or so.  They have children's activities such as a scavenger hunt, kids fish derby, bingo,etc. to keep the youngun's amused.  They have an inground pool and a lodge with a ping pong table and pool table.  They are 5 min away from the French River trading post which is a good distraction for a hour or so.  You are also near the French River Visitor Centre which has an awesome display of the history on the French.  And if you want you are close to Sudbury where you can go to Science North or catch a movie or go shopping.  They have 16' lunds with 15hp yamahas.  And if you want to go fishing, the catching ain't too bad.  WR"
