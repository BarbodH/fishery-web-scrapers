775027,ecmilley,2013-03-21 19:45:00,2163,yup have a xlt in backyard like that 2000 pulls to get it going then runs great rest of day
775039,mr blizzard,2013-03-21 21:07:00,1589, do u just scribe a line from the mounts onto the frame to ensure correct placement
775046,Old Man,2013-03-21 21:34:00,822,That would be you best bet.
774809,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 19:33:00,1589,"There is a bolt I cannot reach at the bottom of my starter for removal, please can someone tell me that I do not have to lift the motor out to reach it.  Any help is greatly appreciated. John"
774812,bare foot wader,2013-03-20 19:35:00,1354,"what vehicle/engine?  I've never seen a starter that was too hard to remove, all my vehicles have been a few bolts, drop in and out and done...but I've heard some  horror stories but they were luxury cars, mercedes and a caddy   nevermind, my bad - sled...not a lot of help there"
774814,ecmilley,2013-03-20 19:42:00,2163,see if there is a removable plastic plug in the cowling to give access to the bolt from the outside.
774816,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 19:52:00,1589,"No worries man, i wish it was a car or truck."
774818,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 19:56:00,1589," Thanks great thought, but unfortuately nothing like that, I dont want to pull the clutch off either if I do not have to.  Who designs these dang things anyway LOL, well more like lol it's not really that funny.  Still 4 feet of ice with good snow on the lakes."
774820,irishfield,2013-03-20 20:04:00,26272,"I feel you pain.. I had to unbolt my engine to get it high enough to fix a fuel line last winter, that the mice ate!"
774825,Old Man,2013-03-20 20:24:00,822,Have you tried a starter wrench?   
774826,BillM,2013-03-20 20:25:00,17367,Can you get a crows foot in there?
774827,Old Man,2013-03-20 20:26:00,822,Or a crowfoot wrench?  
774831,lew,2013-03-20 20:37:00,12766," Don't remember where I got it, but I've had one of those wrenches in my box for probably 30 years, use it all the time,  and never knew it was called a starter wrench.  Thanks for the lesson Old Man"
774832,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 20:42:00,1589,OUCH thats worse than tax pain
774834,jedimaster,2013-03-20 20:46:00,3472,I had to make a wrench to get mine out a long time ago. took a spanner and cut it on a 45 and welded it back together. still have it today haha. I think you may be able to get it by removing the exhuast manifold.
774838,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 20:57:00,1589,"Thanks Old Man, judging by the shape it might work"
774840,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 20:59:00,1589,"Bill I will check that out also, I know I have a few of those  given to me from my dad a few years ago,  forgot about them till u mentioned it."
774844,mr blizzard,2013-03-20 21:08:00,1589,"Thanks to Jedimaster, I will try the other wrenches first but if not a torch is coming out, there is too much snow and ice not to enjoy Cheers Some do hickies you never let go of . Might have to customize a wrench haha."
774866,Old Man,2013-03-20 22:42:00,822,You can usaully pick up a cheap set of starter wrenches at Princess Auto.
774869,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-20 22:44:00,10439, The nearest Princess Auto is 1500 kms away.
774871,Old Man,2013-03-20 22:47:00,822,Didn't notice the location. Sure they won't be as cheap up there.  I guess PA isn't that far away if you order online.  http://www.princessauto.com/pal/product/8287385/Sets/3-pc-%22S%22-Type-SAE-Box-End-Wrench-Set
774997,Tybo,2013-03-21 17:02:00,1373,"One thing about blind bolts.It is not getting the bolt out but getting it back in.If you don't have room to work fingers too start the bolt your beat. What I do when it comes to blind nuts or bolts is once loosen,I try to remove an install before I remove conponent.."
775000,mr blizzard,2013-03-21 17:44:00,1589,"Thanks for the tipTybo, looks like I will have to lift the motor"
775013,ecmilley,2013-03-21 18:38:00,2163,well it's only a 500 whats wrong with pulling the rope to start it
775014,Old Man,2013-03-21 18:42:00,822,Make sure you don't throw off the center to center measurement on the primary to secondary drives or the belt alignment.
775019,mr blizzard,2013-03-21 19:18:00,1589,"Under - 20c it takes almost 20 pulls, runs great once it fires up"
775022,mr blizzard,2013-03-21 19:37:00,1589,"good point , have taken an engine out before but  not the clutch, can u please if u have the time pm me  about this center to center  measurement etc , I love to learn."
775026,ecmilley,2013-03-21 19:44:00,2163,"if your taking the engine out your removing the primary with it, mark your mounts because that's how centre to centre and offset are set (sliding motor mounts)"
