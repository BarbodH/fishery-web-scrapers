The morning temps were, well brisk is a good word. -35 with -44 windchills!!!!! To make things worse I had a loose connection to the defogger in my snowmobile helmet and blew a fuse so had no defogging and had to ride with my visor open the whole trip. It was not a whole lot of fun to say the least. I had to stop numerous times to de-ice my eye lashes as they kept freezing my eyes shut.  We finally made it to our chosen destination and Bob found out the powerhead for his Jiffy auger made a break for freedom somewhere along the trail. While he went motor hunting the rest of us cleared snow and drilled holes with my auger. Just in time to get a line down Bob returns from his hunting trip...............SUCCESSFUL!!!  The fishing was awesome, the catching not so much. We did have a bunch of fish on (some right to the hole) but only managed two on the ice. Bob got a good eater laker about 4 pounds and I got a delicious burbot about the same size.  The fish were being really finicky all day. I had 3 fish at one point following from 60' to 10' and back to 60' for minutes at a time but I just couldn't coax them to eat.  I ended up 1 for 3 with 3 dozen follows for the day.  Had some sled issues on the way home as well when I broke a carbide runner on my left ski and punched a hole through the ski. Off to the Yamaha dealer tomorrow for a new ski and carbides. Wallets probably gonna be two or three hundred bucks lighter.  All in all t'was a good day with a bunch of new friends and tonight the pièce de résistance was the Beer Battered Burbot and Beef!!!  "

Used to have that problem with a helmet visor too if it was simply too cold... so as back-up there was always a pair of goggles, wrapped in an extra balaclava.  Those ling nuggets and steak... my God, would rather that than this Raisin Bran for breaky today."

774378,Rod Caster,2013-03-18 16:47:00,5784,Beer Battered Burbot has a nice ring to it!  We were a bit cold yesterday on the ice and it was only -11.... embarassing isn't it
774433,pidge,2013-03-18 22:49:00,438,Quite the dedication Drifter. 25k on a sled in those temps must be something else to do..I cant imagine. Good report though and good on your buddie for finding his motor. Gotta run to the fridge your making me hungry. Heres some more B's for ya lol.
774914,ccmtcanada,2013-03-21 02:25:00,7971,"I'd say it was 5 B's.  the first one being ""brrrrrr""!!!!  Great report.  Never a dull moment with the defogging and sled issues!!  That meal looks awesome!"
