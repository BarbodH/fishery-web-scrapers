774980,Freshtrax,2013-03-21 15:14:00,2215,Takes us about two weeks to trap a raccoon here on the farm.   9 times out of ten we end up with a barn cat.
775193,ch312,2013-03-22 17:35:00,1590," well, i sure wouldn't be trapping dead cats   setting live traps for cats is 100% legal, but using kill traps would likely end up costing you a nice chunk of change and possibly jail time if caught. i took it upon myself to make sure that doing so was legal before buying a trap. although they'd never go on record saying this, the local SPCA fully supports the trapping and extermination of stray/feral cats as they spread disease, reproduce like crazy, and kill millions of small game and birds yearly. i believe they keep them for a maximum of one week before disposing of them? i also believe it costs $50 or more for the owners to get their cats back from the SPCA.  although it may not be best for making friends, you could technically set the trap in the middle of your yard where it's visible to your neighbors and they can't do anything about it if their cat wanders into your trap.  people really need to stop being so ignorant and learn the facts about the harm house cats cause when they roam free.   some negatives of cats roaming free:  -crap makes a mess in gardens and spreads disease -urinating/spraying smells horrible and also spreads disease -get into garbage more than coons around here -fight and cause damage to cats and small dogs who are leashed -kill millions of small game and song birds yearly for fun, not to eat -have even caused vehicle accidents due to people trying to avoid them -uncontrolled reproduction ensures this gets worse every year  the only positive for cats roaming off their property is less crap to scoop out of the litter box, if they even own one."
775391,manitoubass2,2013-03-24 15:34:00,11391,cats in my area feed the eagles...that's positive isn't it?
773610,davey buoy,2013-03-13 21:24:00,5505," Never under astimate the power of mom,The dog is alright!!!!! Little graphic,but all ends well."
773612,BillM,2013-03-13 21:39:00,17367,That dog almost died man...   Read this.   Although the only person to blame is the owner who think's it's ok to let his dog roam free.   GOOD JOB IDIOT!!!  Too bad the deer didn't attack him instead.  http://wildgunmen.com/blog/2010/06/29/a-deer-attacked-my-dog/
773613,davey buoy,2013-03-13 21:43:00,5505,I think the man stayed well away by the sounds of it.
773616,ch312,2013-03-13 21:48:00,1590, fixed
773619,Tayzak15,2013-03-13 21:53:00,318,If a dog is well trained I see no problem in letting them walk around freely. This was just an unfortunate incident of being at the wrong place at the wrong time for both the deer and the dog.
773620,davey buoy,2013-03-13 21:53:00,5505,Never new they possessed that type of anger.People need to be aware there not just cute animals.
773621,BillM,2013-03-13 21:54:00,17367," From a legal standpoint the cat can roam around all it wants, the dog not so much.    Too bad about the pup, that was a scary scene."
773623,kemper,2013-03-13 22:09:00,2232, Just about any type of wild animal has the potential to bang you up pretty good if it feels threatened.  The baby deer is a cute little bugger isn't it
773624,fishindevil,2013-03-13 22:18:00,6254,cute animals right !!!! try getting a full grown raccoon into a corner and see how cute they are !!! it will tear anything apart
773627,davey buoy,2013-03-13 22:22:00,5505,"Cornering is different,I'd come out swinging lol.But to go out of her way to protect the little one was shocking.I would of thought because of there size,she would protect herself and the little one where she stands?.She was really aggressive in my mind especially in a house/city type area."
773629,mr blizzard,2013-03-13 22:30:00,1589,"The deer thing is a common occurence in the greater Vancouver are as well according to my brother, they can turn it on when they want too. Postman have been attacked by deer down there."
773633,206,2013-03-13 22:41:00,563,"Not in my town Cat ""must be leashed at all times""  too bad the police can't enforce it...hate the cat crap in my gardens   Poor dog but yes no matter how well trained should be attended, I know I woulda took my dog inside til the dear had moved on."
773640,glen,2013-03-13 23:01:00,2641,They just wanted to pet the cute deer.
773661,Cookslav,2013-03-14 00:56:00,1457,Bizzar....  I've heard of it happening but its rare I would think. Whats crazy is how that momma took and offensive to protect the fawn?  Whats bizzar is that dog is a lot bigger then your average hound dog yet beagles run deer all season with out issue? I guess the Maternal instinct is to blame for this one.  Hope the pooch is ok...that poor dog didn't know what hit him.
773665,nancur373,2013-03-14 01:24:00,1211,Cayenne pepper! sprinkle it in your garden/flower bed
773687,turtle,2013-03-14 11:09:00,274,"The doe is OK with the cat but as soon as she sees the dog she freaks out.  I've seen this video before and not suprised by the doe's reaction to a dog when she is with a fawn. The dog also seems pretty docile, good for being a pet but bad for life & death confrontations."
773703,torco,2013-03-14 14:05:00,656,"That was just a crazy video....that poor dog, not sure why it was roaming around free but wrong place at the wrong time, it seemed to be caught by surpise thats forsure. easily could have been stomped to death. As for that cat, well cats are crazy and that one was lucky it came out no worse for the wear."
773745,ch312,2013-03-14 19:03:00,1590," legal or not, it's not right to allow any pet to wander the neighborhood causing problems for others, especially when it comes to cats who get into garbage, crap in gardens, kill small animals for fun, and cause problems for other people. i'll never understand how anyone can let their cat roam free knowing full well that it's likely causing problems for something or someone else.  luckily, it's 100% legal to live trap cats and hand them over to the SPCA where the owner has the pleasure of paying $50+ to get their animal back"
773747,BillM,2013-03-14 19:17:00,17367," Trapping live cats, that's pretty hilarious, lol!!"
773766,jbailey,2013-03-14 22:54:00,866,its actually not legal in most areas to let your cat roam around outside...
773768,BillM,2013-03-14 23:32:00,17367, I'd like to see the law that states outdoor cats are illegal.    I'm just playing devils advocate btw
773785,Leecher,2013-03-15 01:31:00,7832,"Poor dog got a good hoofing from that doe   hope he's fine... but that cat got lucky... guess that's why they have nine lives    The doe had a normal behaviour protecting her fawn... in the bush, deer don't see cats and dogs... more like wolves, bears and wild cats (lynx. etc...)  I think the doe and her fawn was in the wrong place to begin with and I don't blame her for reacting that way... just protecting her offspring."
773790,Sinker,2013-03-15 03:03:00,8692,"Yeah, you can't let your cats roam free in this township. A lot of rural people I know fix them real quick too.  Dogs should be leashed too. I don't leash my dog on my property, and a lot of the time when we're walking, but I have his leash, and he will come to me when he's called. I'm pretty rural though. If I was in town he'd be leashed always. Its not him I worry about, its some other dumbass's dog that scares me!.......or. A doe with a fawn I guess lol  S."
773792,Sinker,2013-03-15 03:15:00,8692,"Oh, BillM, check the township by laws regarding cats. You may be surprised. I just did a quick look for barrie, and its illegal to let cats run at large. Give it a read, some good things to know in there.  S."
773798,BillM,2013-03-15 04:12:00,17367, My bad for making assumptions..   All my pets are indoors
