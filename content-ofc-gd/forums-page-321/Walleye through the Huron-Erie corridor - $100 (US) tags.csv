There are now walleye in the system that sport reward tags. The tags are spaghetti-type tags, not the standard metal jaw tags. See the image of the poster below for more details. These posters will be showing up at bait shops and launch sites along Lake Erie, the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair, the St. Clair River, and Lake Huron. - Mike Thomas, Fisheries Research Biologist, MDNR Lake St. Clair Fisheries Research Station, [emailÂ protected]"
