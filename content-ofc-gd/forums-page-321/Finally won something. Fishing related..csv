774897,grt1,2013-03-21 00:52:00,638,looks like it was designed for the wild rogue camoflaged pike
774964,Joey,2013-03-21 14:06:00,9122,Now how are the fish gonna see that lure  Congrats on the win.  Go buy a lottery ticket now
774969,pidge,2013-03-21 14:22:00,438,Hahahaha my thoughts exactly Joey lol. Any boat contests ??lol
775041,SirWhite,2013-03-21 21:19:00,210,Nice look! You gonna keep it or sell it?
775053,pidge,2013-03-21 21:59:00,438,"SirWhite I think I'll just keep it sealed in the box and hang onto it. I honestly have enough blue,perch,pink and many other colours to play with. I thought when I filled out the contest it said limited number so ill just hold onto it and maybe sell it to Chum Lee in thirty years lol."
775067,SirWhite,2013-03-21 22:35:00,210,Another lure too pretty to throw!
