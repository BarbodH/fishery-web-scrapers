774999,mike rousseau,2013-03-21 17:15:00,4661,Anyone have any reviews on the bait caster version?  Cabelas has them for 159 plus 30 rebate... So 129 from 199....  They look pretty cool... And that's a pretty good discount...
775002,Luke V.,2013-03-21 17:50:00,286,"Thats a killer price. I bought one last spring. Have used it all season for many different types of fishing. It nice and light, and feels good in my hands. The drag pulls smooth. With the 6;3;1 gear ratio you can crank fish into the boat. I have never had it fail me. I would recommend it!  I might even get another for that price.  Edit: I see they are offering the 7:3:1 ratios only on sale"

So, no, I can't comment on your particular reel but I have been impressed with what I have used from Okuma thus far. My combination pulls a hookless daredevil through a snow encrusted back yard like no baitcaster that I have ever owned. Jim"
