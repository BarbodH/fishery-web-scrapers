775289,nancur373,2013-03-23 12:24:00,1211,Will do
775297,mr blizzard,2013-03-23 14:26:00,1589,Good luck and I hope u find what your after but be careful on prices. Lived 3 miles from there for 18 years and frequented the auction countless times.  For the purchase of our 2 sleds and 2 atvs in each and every case we walked away from the auction without buying and on the 4 sepeate purchases got a better product for much less money on kijiji.  The purchases took us from Carp to Callender but well worth it.  Too many people bidding on too few items.
775300,SirWhite,2013-03-23 15:03:00,210,"Filled with vehicles no one can sell or wants to. From my experiences anyway. Easy to get caught up in the bidding too! Lol. Not sure why I wanted a '92 Land Rover with 329000kms on it, but I rode all the way to $3500 until I finally came to my senses.  Good luck OP an keep us posted"
