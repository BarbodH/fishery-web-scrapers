773652,Rich Clemens,2013-03-13 23:50:00,3131,Fake or not - that is halarious. Patsy just bought a Camero a couple months ago and she's rolling on the floor laughing.

775322,atvaholic,2013-03-23 21:46:00,271,Dont know if it was a fake but that salesman genuinely looked terrified!

775372,Canuck,2013-03-24 11:25:00,491,Lots of info on the web. The salesman is an actor. It's a commercial after all!  Still funny though. But not as funny as the hundreds of youtube videos of jiggly women passengers in hot cars and trucks. Kinda brings out the 16 yr old in this 50 yr old!
