775479,wall i,2013-03-25 02:24:00,48,Never had any issues with 832...bleeds but otherwise prefer it to PP. Samurai good but not worth the premium over Sufix.
775563,manjo39,2013-03-25 19:19:00,354, x2 - Never had issues with 832.  My used bled 832 is now the same colour as my new PP Slick Moss Green.
774923,Cudz,2013-03-21 03:44:00,2652,That is all.  I guess for the people who use this line it is a good deal.
774924,nexstar,2013-03-21 03:50:00,63,Thanks for the heads up. They have this on sale every year and it's a good deal.
774930,mike rousseau,2013-03-21 06:05:00,4661,I tried that line last year...  Worst braid I've tried ever for how I fish...  Threw it out after 2-3 weeks if frustration
774947,lookinforwalleye,2013-03-21 12:57:00,4399,"Ya I bought some on sale last year, not overly impressed with it but then again not overly impressed with braid period!"
774948,BillM,2013-03-21 12:58:00,17367,Awful line... it lasted 3 days before I removed it..
774993,registerfly,2013-03-21 16:54:00,198,"seems a few don't like it, but can you elaborate as to why or what properties of it that didn't work for you?  I mostly use pp but also not too big of a fan of it.  I also have the 832 on one set up and so far doesn't seem too far off from the pp"
774994,BillM,2013-03-21 16:55:00,17367,I had tip wrap like crazy when using it for topwaters..  It would even trip wrap when jigging for walleyes..  Way too limp for it's own good if you ask me.
774998,mike rousseau,2013-03-21 17:10:00,4661,Yup Tip wrap...
775003,musky_hunter,2013-03-21 17:51:00,328,Sunline Fx2/Sx1 and Daiwa Samurai...
775008,Dan668,2013-03-21 18:05:00,1120,"Hands down best. Only braids i use. Although i dont use it for many applications. I had suffix for a bit, didnt have any problems, the colour bled pretty quickly. Only reason its not on my reel is because my friend thought he could use a baitcaster and completely ruined the line after his first cast."
775023,salmon,2013-03-21 19:38:00,334,Yup Dead on Use the Sufix performance braid it is a much better braid than the 832.
775025,BillM,2013-03-21 19:40:00,17367,"Jose, I loved that Suffix you had on the Calais when you sold it to me     I'm fairly certain they don't sell it anymore however."
775028,davey buoy,2013-03-21 19:52:00,5505,"8/30 power pro,I have no problems.Stayed away from Suffix because of the reviews."
775040,SirWhite,2013-03-21 21:16:00,210,"I had it in my hand today, if it wasn't for this thread I would have purchased it! I lost what would have been my PB Smallmouth last year because of tip wrap (Spiderwire braid 30#) on my spinning setup. Is pure Flouro the best thing to use on a Spinning Dropshot/jig combo?"
775042,BillM,2013-03-21 21:21:00,17367, I wouldn't be using 30# braid on a spinning setup..  Most I ever go for any kind of fishing with my spinning setups is 6 or 8lb...   Combine that with a flouro leader and you should be good to go.   If I need to run heavier (20# braid) I'll use a baitcast setup instead.
775047,solopaddler,2013-03-21 21:42:00,8605,"I run 832 on my spinning reel along with a fluoro tippet throwing hardware for steelhead. I like it for that purpose a lot, for exactly the reasons you guys don't like it. It's incredibly thin and limp and is maybe the best braid I've used for hucking out spinners and spoons long distances. Tip wrap is not an issue for me.  For pretty much every other application I use power pro."
775078,family guy,2013-03-21 23:19:00,22,"Never had any of the problems that have been mentioned.  This is not the line to use for top water because of its sinking qualities.  I have used it for my flipping, pitching, jigging spoons, tubes and jerk baits.  All with no problems."
775104,walleye wanderer,2013-03-22 01:42:00,64,"I'm with Mike on this one, spooled a couple of reels last year and no issues. Get great distance with no tips issues but it does fade quick. I will be trying the Samurai this season."
775111,BillM,2013-03-22 02:08:00,17367,"If I want distance with my spinning gear, I'll use Nanofil.  Nothing comes close."
775112,DoubleDigits,2013-03-22 02:10:00,140,"Sunline is the nicest braid I've ever used, but I do like Suffix 832. There is much worse out there."
775133,ah_long,2013-03-22 04:54:00,354,"Sunline is definitely better than 832, I had 832 on all my reels, but I find the new batch is way more stiff than when it first came out  btw, I was @ Bass City in Markham today for their anniversary sale, there's 40% off all fishing line. There's Power Pro, Sunline FC Sniper, Sunline FX2, some 832, Daiwa Samurai, Super 8 slick and more.. better deal and selection than the CTC sale IMO  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bass-City/148391201992365"
775146,fishindevil,2013-03-22 11:49:00,6254,"used the 832 on a few baitcasters,and 1 spinning and do not like it too much fades pretty quick,last year i switched everything to super 8 slick,and its by far the best braid i have used so far !!!!"
775392,manitoubass2,2013-03-24 15:39:00,11391,"Nanofil is crazy for casting distance! It's actually shocking the first time you cast with it, lol. Too bad it frays so easily though."
775401,hotsky,2013-03-24 16:41:00,400,I was in the States couple weeks ago they sell PowerPro at walmart for $12 regular price...needless to say I picked some up.
775430,davey buoy,2013-03-24 21:52:00,5505,"I love that stuff,$12 bucks ,CT has a deal every now and than close to that price. I agree grab it while you can. Everyday price  ."
