It was also a good opportuntiy for giving some micro bucktails a good workout. Also a good time for the dogs to get out and socialize with strangers and strange dogs and be in the open around water.    Morning sun warmed up a calm morning,  sped up the thaw, and the pannies came out to play. Not too bad a day.    We also have 2 very tired puppy dogs "

Fished a Kawartha lake today and took 34 cranks with the hand auger to get through. I'm guessing 20 inches of ice still. Trucks and SUV's ...but not mine...still driving out on it.  Came home with a sunburn and an assortment of perch, gills and crappie   No monsters but enough for 4 bags of fillets for the freezer."
