774651,irishfield,2013-03-20 01:06:00,26272,Buy him a $31 bottle of El Dorado Silver Deluxe.. and he'll love you and hate you at the same time.. as he continues to buy it and tries to find a store that stocks it to satisfy his new taste!
774657,Sinker,2013-03-20 01:14:00,8692,"I can't stand rum, but a buddy of mine is a rum guy, and swears by Old Sam. Hard to find, very dark, and even I can manage to tip back a few of them. Its an east coast thing, but I'm pretty sure it comes from jamaica. Any other rum gives me the heebee jeebies.  S."
774674,solopaddler,2013-03-20 02:01:00,8605, Spike it with maple syrop and you'll be good to go.
774703,Sinker,2013-03-20 03:45:00,8692,Everything is good with maple syrup  or whiskey!  S.
774714,Burtess,2013-03-20 11:03:00,901,"So I picked up a bottle of the Ron Zacapa 23 Centenario, mostly because of the nice bottle and it came in a box lol...  He said one of his high roller poker buddies has brought it over before and if he would buy any bottle he would have picked that one, so I think I did OK.  I think he normally drinks Bacardi or Capt Morgan so at least its something different.  Thanks very much for all the suggestions.... I may have to try this stuff.  Burt"
774720,wallyboss,2013-03-20 12:34:00,1095,The 2 best dark rums in my opinion are. 1) Brugal Anejo 2) Havana Club 7
774748,deermedo,2013-03-20 14:42:00,3,Pussers Its an old British Navy rum from the Caribbean available in most LCBO locations. I'm not sure how amber it is but I can say it is wonderful and there is not enough o's in smoooooooooooooooooooooooth!
774753,quickme,2013-03-20 15:13:00,261,"wow no one mentioned Legendario?  Legendario elixir de cuba is one of the best sipping rums in my option.  Very hard to find in Ontario but you may be able to find it outside of the province ( Damn LCBO)  If you have any friends that may be going to Cuba its a must have.  About $11 for a bottle.  Give it a ""shot"" if you get a chance.   nick"
774767,wallyboss,2013-03-20 16:05:00,1095, Not for everybody!!!! One of my buddies said the same thing and I brought back 2 bottles in January.  And i can't stand the stuff. I guess it's an aquired taste just like mamajuana from the Dominican.(that's stuff I like)
774785,quickme,2013-03-20 17:11:00,261, interesting....  I guess not everyone like sweet rum.  Legendario does make a nice 7 year old rum that i've bought.  I think its called dorando..  I'd be more than happy to take those 2 bottles off your hand.  Nick
774822,Burtess,2013-03-20 20:11:00,901,   You're going to have to trade him some Dominican mamajuana for it lol....
774823,wallyboss,2013-03-20 20:15:00,1095,"Actually I gave them to my buddy that said it was good.  Maybe it was all planned!!!   I brought a lot of Dominican rum back 3 weeks ago, declared everything and it cost me $108.00 of duty fees. But I am not going to run out of Brugal Anejo."
774911,walleye wanderer,2013-03-21 02:08:00,64,"Thanks Dan but a search of the LCBO site comes up empty for the Kracken, gonna stop in at my store tomorrow and inquire. Cheers"
774953,quickme,2013-03-21 13:50:00,261, LOL... i would have but i finished that bottle already  .  I'm going back to DR in August so I'm sure I'll be coming home with more
774970,wallyboss,2013-03-21 14:26:00,1095,"Quick me,  I brought back  some of that branch and root mixture a few years back and I now make my own mamajuana. I always have 2 x 1 liters on the go. I make one with white wine in the recipe and the other one with red wine.  Just make sure that if you bring some back that it is not in it's dry form or it could be confiscated at the airport,  I didn't know that when I brought mine back but they never checked my luggage and I had declared it.   If you need the recipe of ingredients to add to the roots and spice concoction."
774985,Hooked,2013-03-21 15:59:00,891, That's because it's spelled Kraken.   I still have to try that one.
775105,walleye wanderer,2013-03-22 01:47:00,64,"LMAO, that's better, in fact its on sale right now!"
775224,lhousesoccer,2013-03-22 21:46:00,442," Burtess (and BillM).  Skip the amber rum, and as BillM suggested, go straight for the dark stuff.  Black, in fact.  Black Rum.  So good.  Gosling's is my favourite, especially if mixed as a Dark 'n Stormy using good Bermuda Stone Ginger Beer.  Dark ‘n’ Stormy  2 ounces Gosling’s Black Seal black rum About 4 ounces Gosling’s Stormy Ginger Beer (or other ginger beer) Lime slice, for garnish. Fill a highball glass with ice and add the ginger beer. Top with the black rum, so it layers real nice on top, and garnish with the lime slice.  I prefer mine with 4-5 dashes of angostura bitters on top as well, but that's optional.         "

775235,kickingfrog,2013-03-22 22:49:00,8333,  That is something I want to try!
775533,quickme,2013-03-25 14:41:00,261,  i know what i'm going to have at dinner time tonight!  thanks!   nick
774431,Burtess,2013-03-18 22:43:00,901,"One of my buddies does my taxes and we usually give him a big home made lazagna and a case of tall boys.  I know he likes rum, anyone have a suggestion on a good light/amber rum that's not ""run of the mill""?  Thanks, Burt"
774438,solopaddler,2013-03-18 23:08:00,8605,I'm a rum guy myself and imo nothing tops Havana Club. If I'm slumming Appletons is pretty darned good.  If you want something extra special they sometimes have some phenominal but expensive bottles in the vintage section of the LCBO in Dundas.
774439,tbayboy,2013-03-18 23:09:00,1497,Just got back from Barbados - if he likes sipping his rum you can't go wrong with Mount Gay Extra Old: http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/lcbo/product/searchResults.do?ITEM_NAME=MOUNT+GAY+RUM+EXTRA+OLD+RUM&ITEM_NUMBER=&language=EN
774446,Pigeontroller,2013-03-19 00:08:00,2793,I recently had a bottle of Cockspur Old Gold from Barbados...Boy was it good. LCBO doesn't seem to carry it though....
774449,Ben_Daniels,2013-03-19 00:15:00,435,Sailor Jerry is my favorite. Followed by Kraken and Appleton reserve. Mt. Gay XO is also pretty good
774451,tknohpy,2013-03-19 00:23:00,162,Lemon Hart is a fantastic rum
774466,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-19 01:59:00,10439,
774467,walleye wanderer,2013-03-19 02:07:00,64,Sailor Jerry is good and have heard good things about Kracken but can't seem to find it in Ontario?
774474,Ben_Daniels,2013-03-19 02:40:00,435,They have both at my local LCBO in Toronto. Try searching the LCBO's website for locations that carry either. If you can't find some locally you can ask your local store to have some sent over from another LCBO.
774479,BillM,2013-03-19 02:53:00,17367," Mike has turned me into a dark rum fan, I've gotta admit...   We needed more booze on the Sutton, next time we'll pack accordingly!!!"
774482,alphaalpha,2013-03-19 03:13:00,475,"Been a long time since I've posted but had a couple tonight and was surfing and came upon this.  Rum is also my drink of choice but tastes can differ quite a bit.  Appleton's was suggested above but it is one of the few that I really dislike, I find it more akin to a poor tasting whiskey than a good rum.  Kraken is decent but strong and not really a sipping rum but goes nice with coke/pepsi.  Most of the rum's I really enjoy aren't found here, I have a few pilot friends that bring me back what I prefer.  When I run out of that however I usually pick up a bottle of Captain Morgan's spiced for mixed drinks.  That being said any rum drinker I am sure will greatly appreciate something new so I would suggest finding something in the vintage section...you can often find something in the 50-70 range that will be good and likely new to them  -AA."
774485,kemper,2013-03-19 03:27:00,2232,"In my opinion you will not find a better rum then Ron Zacapa Centenario 23. Distilled in the mountains of Guatemala, and has a very distinct taste. Incredibly smooth - served with a few drops of cola or straight up on the rocks.  Can be difficult to find, but absolutely worth it (and every dollar you will have to pay).  **Edit - I should add that the only reason I can afford to drink this stuff is because my girlfriend's grandmother actually lives in the Zacapa region of Guatemala, so I encourage them to smuggle as much as they can carry back every time they visit.  It will run you about $100/bottle here (if you can find it). Costs ~$30 USD in Guatemala."
774496,Hooked,2013-03-19 05:01:00,891," I too am a rum guy and agree with Mike here.  Havana Club is my favourite hands down.  They typically sell one with brown label and one with the black.  Bot are really good but the black labelled one is aged longer.  So more $$$.  Not a huge fan of Appletons, But definitely check the vintage section for something unique."
774504,solopaddler,2013-03-19 09:43:00,8605," Ah yes, do you remember this night on the river? Good times my friend.  "
774514,grimsbylander,2013-03-19 11:29:00,3016,"El Dorado rum served neat, with a Guinness."
774521,wkrp,2013-03-19 11:52:00,656,Ditto on that one.
774528,Burtess,2013-03-19 12:28:00,901,"Wow, thanks for all the info and suggestions, I will look through the LCBO website and find something for him.  Burt"
774530,nancur373,2013-03-19 12:37:00,1211,It's a little run of the mill but I love Cabot Tower. London Dock ain't too shabby too. Also if you can get some 'real' Lambs Navy 'the 150 proof' that's good stuff
774531,mbac31,2013-03-19 12:42:00,904,Sea Wynde is a very nice rum
774532,mbac31,2013-03-19 12:44:00,904,Sea Wynde is a very nice rum
774561,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-19 16:30:00,10439, Is that a herd of polar bears in the background?
774566,kickingfrog,2013-03-19 16:40:00,8333,I'm still working on the Havana Club dark and amber that I picked-up in Cuba. To be honest I mix mine with so much coke that I'm not sure it makes a difference. I just use barcardi white for mojitos.
774570,BillM,2013-03-19 16:48:00,17367," I couldn't see 10ft after all that booze, so I probably wouldn't have noticed, lol."
774600,blaque,2013-03-19 21:05:00,2419," Right on for the El Dorado. Otherwise, the old standby......and overmarketed.......Captain Morgan will do just fine."
774609,Steve,2013-03-19 22:14:00,2075,I know i'd appreciate a BenRiach Speyside Single Malt aged 15 years non chill filtered in dark rum wood finish.  Best of both worlds. A beauty single malt finished in dark rum barrels.
