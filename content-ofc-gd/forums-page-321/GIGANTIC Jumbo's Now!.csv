774459,Slayingm,2013-03-19 00:59:00,204,"This winter has been a total blessing with not only awesome ice conditions but some of the best and consistent fishing action all season long. From fun fishing and guide trips on various northern lakes to the world-class fishing on Simcoe this past weekend was no exception! With guests from Michigan the target species was Jumbo Perch and man did we hit not only numbers but best some of the biggest 'Yellows' of the season. The incredible details and accuracy of Marcums LX-5 flasher and new LX-9 sonar and underwater viewing system made finding the right structure and catching fish easy.  We targeted hard bottom area's in 20 to 25ft of water where these Tank Perch were forging on 2"" Gobies, crayfish and minnnows.  With the snow melting off the lake and added light penetration the bite was light and key was to drop down to 2lb fluorocarbon leaders to maximize lures action with maintaining zero line visibility.  BlueFox flash spoons and UV Jigging Raps tipped with Wax worms completed the successful setup. The key to catching throughout the day was watching how the fish reacted to be triggered with various snaps and pauses of the lures and working various depths to find that most productive pattern(s) as the day progressed.  At the end of the day Big Smiles, tanned faces and Monster Jumbo's was the reward.With flowing rivers and eroding shorelines the upcoming days please be extra safe if you decide to head out before the hardwater season ends.   Be safe and Good Fish'n... G."
