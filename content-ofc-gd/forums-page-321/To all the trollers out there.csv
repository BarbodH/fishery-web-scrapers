775443,babaganoush,2013-03-24 23:32:00,105,Will be trolling the great lakes for the first time this year so need some advice. Just bought a Shimano Tekota and now need to know what line I should be running. Majority of the time I will be trolling for trout and salmon. Should I go with a braid or mono and what pound test.  Thanks
775446,fishindevil,2013-03-24 23:43:00,6254,Fill it with 30lb 7-8 strand wire and run a dipsey diver !!!!! Get some flashers and some atomic trolling flies and you are all set !!!!  That's if you don't have riggers ??

775458,Pigeontroller,2013-03-25 00:21:00,2793,"Mono works well with downriggers, 17 lb. test is a good size. Dipsey Diver like pictured above by Fishindevil work best on braid or wire line."
775460,chris.brock,2013-03-25 00:25:00,4053,"I'm not an expert, but on a downrigger I used heavy mono (30 or 40lb), it really helped with the water fleas"
775477,mcdougy,2013-03-25 01:58:00,274,"Lead core. Try the new Tuf Line, very thin diameter. Can run a full 10 colors on a smaller reel. Find the book ""precision trolling big water edition"" . Speed is also a very important factor.   If you are using down riggers most go with 30 lb mono and a  lighter leader."
775523,BillM,2013-03-25 13:51:00,17367,"Riggers and dipsys for me...   I'm a relative newbie to the trolling game out there but the worst thing you can do is complicate things... Keep it simple..   You can get cheap dipsy setups (I run Okuma Convectors and Okuma rods with 30# PP, some spin Dr's and flies).. On the riggers it's some old custom Fenwick fibreglass rods, Diawa Sealine 47H's from the 80's and 17lb Trilene big game..   An assortment of spoons (NK's, Michigan Stingers, etc will get you started)...  Body baits like Rapal J11's work great in the spring when you are fishing shallow (15-40ft)"
775532,Uncle Buck,2013-03-25 14:37:00,1000,"i'd spool it with wire... It's a great combo... if you go with wire, make sure you put a twilly tip on the end of the rod  buy something cheaper for using on a rigger...  I have tons of fun running a mono dipsy though also..."
