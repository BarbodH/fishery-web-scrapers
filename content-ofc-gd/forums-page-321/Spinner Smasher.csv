774881,Rich,2013-03-21 00:00:00,3927,"Lucked out, hit a good day, 2nd cast at the first of three open season spots of our journey, slammed a nice hen on a #4 firetiger blue fox spinner. Felt awesome, fought like a champ.  "
774884,Roy,2013-03-21 00:08:00,13728,"Quite the fish there, Rich! You deserve it..you work hard enough at it. Thanks."
774891,Locnar,2013-03-21 00:40:00,645,How was the water conditions? Murky? Most the spots around here have been mighty muddy. Might get out to try a local creek... Maybe I'll finally hit my first trout... ...
774892,BillM,2013-03-21 00:42:00,17367,"Work on that gill hold man, lol."
774940,Rich,2013-03-21 10:59:00,3927,"Thanks Roy.  Conditions have been okay. The murky water lasted one day, the following two days had a perfect stain, then yesterday cleared right back up again. It went from spinners, to bottom bouncing, to floats and in that order the last three days. Haha  It's not the only steelhead we caught. It just had the least descript background."
774950,highdrifter,2013-03-21 13:16:00,2534,Dude!!  There's an entity in our pic!
774951,MJL,2013-03-21 13:25:00,2427, Poltergeists like to fish too  Nice fish Rich
775012,esoxansteel,2013-03-21 18:37:00,1307,"Nice fish Rich,  Good job on the spinner, must have caught it in Port Hope cause you cant use ROE  LOL"
775155,Rich,2013-03-22 12:50:00,3927,"Haha, I have a friend who fishes port hope regularly, he says you're better off with flies anyway. That's off topic, but I dont see what the big deal is.  As for me, I stick to Erie tribs as there are 3 open areas within 20 min of home, year round. And for the record, we got 3 more, eric got one 12 pounder, floating pink worms. I only hooked one on roe, and it was my stinky ""spring roe"""
775206,TJQ,2013-03-22 18:54:00,7806,Nice fish bud.
775211,aplumma,2013-03-22 20:17:00,6896,well done looks like a good meal is coming your way.   Art
775234,glen,2013-03-22 22:44:00,2641,You only catch the nice ones. Congrats.
775236,moxie,2013-03-22 22:49:00,1566,Nice catch. The spinner hit is a blast.
