There are many names on the market that are very much on par with each other.  Having lived in behind the Younge St arena at Victoria we had many years of direct access to Lake Simcoe as well as the joy of riding some amazing trails thru Muskoka and Haliburton.  Now having had 2 winters in Yellowknife with temps from plus 30 in the summer to -53 in the winter I feel the same 2 machines that we had in Innisfil WHICH are the same 2 machines that we have in Yellowknife are tried and tested as any machine can get.  Yes they are a solid axle Polaris 400 chain driven plus a 500 polaris shaft drive. The only thing I have replaced is a battery.  The 500 we use for plowing and ice fishing as well as the 400 for icefishing.  They are no different than cars or trucks, you push them too much, be prepared to pay .  Any of them will encounter issues from time to time  Once u make your purchase enjoy.......there alot of fun"

Unfortunately this was stolen after I owned it a few months. 2. I replaced with a Magnum 500 - Lots of power! Very capable and I owned it for 2 years with no issues. 3. I traded in the Magnum for a Yamaha Rhino 420cc because of all the gear I carry, and wanted to take passengers with me. I absolutly loved the machine and owned it for several years - Did much ice fishing, backwoods fishing and trail riding with it.

775317,ch312,2013-03-23 19:14:00,1590,"  the extra power is welcome when you're trying to turn some heavy and aggressive 27"" or larger tires through peanut butter mud. i've seen quite a few small bores simply bog down before going anywhere in the really thick stuff where the big bores needed the extra horses to get the tires spinning. sure you can get into clutching, but the small bores lose too much top end speed if you go that route.  the extra power also comes in handy when you're trying to get the front end up in a hurry, such as onto large logs, rocks, creek banks, etc. i see it time and time again where riding is just overall easier with that extra snap of power you have available.  a lot of 500's and lower will also have lower top end speed compared to the 700's and such meaning the small bores are run at full throttle just screaming when the big bores are only at 3/4 throttle and cruising even though they're both going the same speed. this often means waiting for the small bores to cool down after overheating...  that said,not too many people downsize after owning a big bore. but, many people waste money buying a smaller ATV when they should have just got the only one they'd ever need the first time. limiting the power until you're ready is as simple as adjusting the throttle or you can even use a programmer and adjust it however you'd like. i've just personally seen too many people buy small machines thinking they'll be okay only to lose a couple grand when the upgrade a year later..."

775405,ch312,2013-03-24 17:11:00,1590," i'm not arguing and i fully respect your opinion as it's definitely a different strokes for different folks type thing. i've been lucky enough to have ridden with literally hundreds of riders and ATV's over the last few years and it's very clear that those who ride big bores usually have a more enjoyable day with much less rider fatigue after the 50km+ runs we often go on.  using a 700 and 450 as an example, the 700 will top out at 100 km/h while the 450 will top out at 80 km/h. so, if you're cruising through fields or on the ice at 75 km/h the 450 will pretty much be ""red lining"" which greatly increases your chances of overheating while the 700 will be cruising along. i see it time and time again where we're forced to stop and wait for the smaller machines to cool down.  as for the obstacles, i wasn't really referring to insane obstacles. even a 12"" log or vertical creek bank is much easier to get over with that extra snap of power to get the front wheels over and to give you an extra pop of momentum to get the rears up and over. many small bores lack power and feel sluggish in doing so. this often results in the rider becoming very fatigued by the end of the day as the small bores often require much more body english to maneuver. it's common for the small bores to be in 4x4 the majority of the time when navigating tricky terrain (which also increases fatigue if you don't have EPS) while the big bores are still in 2 wheel drive.  my point is too many people buy small machines and it ends up costing them thousands by the time they sell the first machine to upgrade to what they should have got in the first place. turning a 1000 into a 500 is as simple as turning a screw or using a programmer while turning a 500 into a 1000 means buying a new machine and losing a ton of cash. people who ATV almost always upgrade, not downsize  you're right, a 500 is definitely capable of doing anything a big bore can. but, riding is so much easier and much less fatiguing when you have more horses available.   much like outboards on boats, most people opt for the more powerful motor right off the hop rather than starting with a small motor and upgrading later as life is easier and cheaper buying the right tool the first time."

Everything that you can think of we have done it.  Bikes are like cars. You need tohave them serviced. Most guys buy them and very rarely bring them back to the dealers for regular preventative maintance. Then complain when they break. Thats rider error.  Ive worked these very well as they are tools and stuff has gotten damaged,broken and just worn out. The newer models are a luxery as they are like driving a cushion of air but alot of parts to break. Use common sense and add some after market or add ons to protect vital components and do regular service and tbese things will last forever.  420-450-500 are all big enough. which one is best. None of them. They all are basically the same. Polaris are a smooth ride and an amazing all around bike and fun to drive. Lost of parts to break but i have yet to break one. Cheapest of my bikes to fix. Hondas are tough but rougher riding and drink a little more gas than i like but very strong machines and less parts exposed to hook up and get bfoken. Parts are very expensive however. But granted they are very tough. Suzukis are a strong machine,drink as much gas as a honda but are probally by far some of the strongest machines out there. Parts are also expensive as much as honda.  Its my experience that these bikes last longer when driven alot and worked like a vehicle. does it justify buying a polaris over a honda or suzuki for ocasional use. No. I would buy a polaris, keep it maintained and you will be good to go. they are much cheaper in price only."

763136,nancur373,2013-01-28 15:00:00,1211,Can't go wrong with Honda. Polaris is a good choice too. I would stay away from Can Am for plowing as they seem to be geared more toward speed and pleasure riding as opposed to a work horse. Kawasaki is good too. More geared towards work and price reflects (usually a little cheaper)
763137,Fisherman,2013-01-28 15:00:00,7201,"Don't be clouded by the cheap prices of the Canned Ham and Polaris,  do a bit more research and you may well find they take more repair time than the others.  Stick with the Yamaha, Honda Kawa and Suzuki lines.  Some still have solid rear axle(Honda), makes for a rougher ride.  Modern fuel injection is the cats meow for cold weather.  Power steering is not for wussies, it makes rough terrain a lot easier to handle.  400 size is about as small as I'd go for plowing, 450/500 would be a bit better.  Going crazy with engine size doesn't really provide anything more than a lighter wallet and bigger gas bill.  We have a couple of older Yamaha Kodiaks at work,  trails in summer, plow in the winter.  They work, period.  8,000km on one almost 5000 on the other,  nothing more than oil changes and a new battery each."

763225,ch312,2013-01-28 19:43:00,1590," i agree with everything you've said, except for what's in bold. in most cases a larger engine means a larger machine which provides more ground clearance. not only that, but the extra power is definitely welcome if you're going to be carrying a passenger, doing a lot of plowing and work with it, or plan on doing a lot of mudding with the possibility of upgrading to bigger tires. lifts and clutch kits can only help a small bore ATV so much...     as with most other thing's you can spend less on the initial purchase, but the repairs and headaches later on will end up costing you MORE than if you would have just bought the quality machine in the first place.  besides the cheap chinese atv's, polaris is the worst you can buy. if you don't believe me, i suggest visiting your local ATV mechanic to see what brand he repairs most often. after that, browse through the classifieds and take a look at how quickly the value of used polaris machines drops and how many there are for sale and then compare the number of used machines to other brands. if you need even more clarification, visit the popular polaris forums and you'll see that their ""repairs/maintenance"" sections contain the most threads.  i'd give up ATVing before owning a polaris..."

763506,ch312,2013-01-29 19:16:00,1590," tires and proper PSI for the conditions are far more important than weight. my grizzly 700 is roughly 175 lbs lighter than my buddies 06 polaris 700, yet i can push nearly twice the amount of snow before losing traction and we both have the same tires and sizes. i do agree with the synthetic rope though and i'll never use wire rope again.  once you have power steering you'll never go back...  fuel injected is awesome for the easy starts and no choke, just make sure you're battery is properly maintained with something like a battery tender jr...   unless you like wrenching more than riding, i'd definitely go with yamaha, kawi, or honda. i've logged 4,000kms of hard trail riding in the last 2 1/2 years and went on a bunch of poker runs with 10-100+ riders. in that short time over a dozen people have sold their polaris' for other brands because they were sick of the headaches, yet i have honestly seen ZERO people ""upgrade"" from another brand to a polaris."

I know everyone's bike is better than their buddy's so IMO my 10 year old can-am ( bombardier back then) is way better than a new polaris or arctic cat.. Lol.. I'm not going to knock any particular brand as they are all pretty good nowadays.  On a more serious note  I recommend 400 or 500 for a first bike.. No need for a 650, 800 or 1000 etc.. When you want to go bigger once you get experienced, then give the 400 to the wife. For working or plowing, my little 400 does just fine.. I plow and I've towed some pretty heavy loads with it.. The bigger bikes don't do it better, just faster... Just use common sense and low range Diff lock is important.. Suzuki's and yamahas have good systems.. Can am's visco-loc works very well to once you learn to drive it Honda doesn't have diff lock, strictly 3wd, and Polaris has a good system, but is prone to failure IRS vs. solid axle: for me, IRS.. But it does have its drawbacks when towing  with a heavy tongue as you loose some ground clearance ( I manage).. 2-up riding has the same effect (single seat ATV's). Also, getting stuck with an IRS bike, and your stuck!! Get the winch out! Solid axle bikes don't really ride that bad with today's good shocks, just not as nice as IRS, and have less body roll in the corners.  So, the choice is yours, it's your money to spend, but I still have to list my favorites and what I would buy 1) Can am 2) Suzuki 3) Yamaha 4) Polaris 5) Honda 6) Kawasaki 7) Arctic Cat Stay away from anything "" offshore"".. When it breaks, you'll never find parts for it...  And a good dealer is better than a good bike.. They all break, but if your dealer takes care of you, that's important.."
763682,ch312,2013-01-30 06:17:00,1590," a small bore is fine for occasional plowing or heavy towing (1,000 lbs+), but the big bores can do it easier and longer. compare them to trucks people use everyday for work. how often do you see anyone moving heavy loads choose a 1/2 ton over a 3/4 or 1 ton? not exactly apples to apples, but the same principal as you're not stressing the machine as much. it's a much wiser financial decision to buy the only tool you'll need rather than upgrading and loosing thousands each time. they all have throttle adjustments, so if you're not ready for the power yet simply adjust the throttle so you don't have full power when you hammer it and then make adjustments as you gain confidence.  yep, diff lock is very important. i can't remember how many times the true 4wd made it possible to climb very steep hills and claw through nasty mud.  solid axles are a thing of the past. with IRS you have a much smoother ride, more ground clearance, and much better traction due to articulation as solids tend to teeter, lifting one wheel off the ground. i removed the sway bar on the grizz (it's only on there because the lawyers made them put it on   )  for even more articulation and the result was better traction and a utility ATV that rides like a sport quad. it requires more body english at high speeds, but it's way more fun.   as for the ""I'm not going to knock any particular brand as they are all pretty good nowadays"" comment, you really need to come down and go for a 100+ (i think the most was 120) ATV poker run on the reserve to see just how well the lower quality machines (polaris) hold up. smoked belts (bad drive system), electrical problems, and overheating are the top reasons for them failing. just overall poor quality.   i have a yamaha and would encourage people to buy one as well, but i assure you that i'm not brand loyal and if i was having problems with it i'd sell it in a heartbeat for another brand. i ended up with a yamaha after literally a year of research with kawi, honda, and suzuki not far behind in terms of long term reliability. the result is an ATV with over 5,000 kms (bought it used, i've logged 4,000) that has needed nothing but brake pads, even though it's been rolled a dozen times (fastest was 50-55 km/h) and i drive it like it's stolen. there hasn't even been a single electrical or mechanical issue after it was submerged 2000 kms ago and the motor, cvt, and both diff's were full of water.  speaking of water in your ATV...  if you ever swamp it you should always remove the spark plug and turn it over to get the water out. if the cylinder has too much water in it and you try to start it the motor can hydrolock and wreck stuff in the motor as it'll try to turn over and compress the water in the cylinder. seeing as water can't compress, there's a good chance you'll break something. stand it up on it's rear to get water out of the exhaust and check the air filter and belt too.  kerosene can be used to flush water from the engine and diffs as it displaces water and is far cheaper than using oil to flush the system and works better.   lastly, nobody is ""too cool"" for a helmet. when i first started riding i was wearing mine half the time before i flipped over the bars once and my head bent the steel rack down 1/2"", i blacked out for a few seconds, and i still had a couple goose eggs and bruises on my head. considering how beat up my head was, i'd say i was really lucky that i had it on that day.    anyone wanna go for a ride? your trails or mine, i'm in"

I am an older, gentle rider so didn't see the need for a bigger, more expensive machine.  I use it mostly for ice fishing just to get on & off the ice.  So big power wasn't necessary for snow plowing, hauling heavy loads or mud bogging.  Boils down to, what do you intend to use the bike for??"
763691,GYPSY400,2013-01-30 10:43:00,191,"ch312.. I agree with most of your post.. I have been to many mud runs. Most of the mud bikes here are Canned Hams, as they are the choice for excellent power and good reliability.. Also, the local dealer is very good.. And at the end of the day, there is usually a Polaris being towed home.. In regards to the size of machine, yes bigger is better, but smaller works ok.. As a first machine, I don't recommend a big bore.. I've seen many inexperienced riders get in over their head.. So to reduce initial cost and possibly YOUR insurance rates ( accident statistics dictate insurance rates) I think a 400-500 is fine for a novice rider.... To compair apples to oranges, just because your buying a new car, doesn't mean you need a corvette!  And yes.. If your going to spend 10 grand on an ATV, you can spend $100 on a helmet!"

That said, having managed a large cattle ranch which used atv's on a daily basis for chores and herding cattle, the best we had for relability was the Kawasaki's followed by the Suzuki's and then the Honda's.  The Can Am's had the best ride and handling. The Polaris we used we're okay but no match for the others. Can't comment on the rest as I have no personal experience with them."
