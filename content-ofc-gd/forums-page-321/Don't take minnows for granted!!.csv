One supplier lost the minnows overnight because of a plug malfunction.And now finding out after Mar 15th or shortly after,4 more suppliers(as we all found out) were out as well. Talked to a local Barrie fellow yesterday asking for sucker minnows,didn't have any.but was quick to mention I have loads of minnows. No worries as I know 4 or 5 places that cary them in the area I'm fishing .lol, was I wrong!,Anyways artificial was slow and produced very little.Still always a good time with friends on a beautiful day. The week after ice huts out,you bet I won't be caught again. I will buy the night before.!!  ."
