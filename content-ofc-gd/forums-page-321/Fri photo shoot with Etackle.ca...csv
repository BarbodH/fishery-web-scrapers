775439,Slayingm,2013-03-24 23:04:00,204,Finally had a chance to get my good friend and Etackle Canada owner Phil Harrison for a perch fish and photo shoot. We hammered some big Jumbos and got some good pics... here are a couple... enjoy:)   
775444,RickOnt,2013-03-24 23:33:00,669,Hey Phil  You are gonna need to invest in a 'knife'!!  Do you know anyone who sells them?? Rick
775445,fishindevil,2013-03-24 23:39:00,6254,Awesome guys !!!! Some nice tank perch
775449,mikdor,2013-03-24 23:47:00,109,It shouldn't take long to fillet 3 perch. lol
775503,solopaddler,2013-03-25 09:23:00,8605,Nice jumbos. I'm shocked that Phil actually fishes though.
775515,Harrison,2013-03-25 12:37:00,2202,"Ha Rick!  Can I borrow your knife?  I bet it's well broken in now.   I hear ya Mike, few hours on the ice AND a few on the river this weekend.  It was needed.  That being said, it took me late intot the night to catch up with work, but well worth it!  Fishing with Greg makes it easy.  He is a good friend and there is little doubt if he is on the fish.  Suprised my eyes are open in that shot with the 50k winds in my face"
