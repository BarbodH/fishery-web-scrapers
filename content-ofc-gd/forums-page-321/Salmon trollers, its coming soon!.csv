Strait Line Anglers Club Port Credit Salmon & Trout Assc. Metro East Anglers Central Lake Ontario Sportsmen's Assc.  I'll encourage you to look up a group that is near you and perhaps you may want to participate with them...  have a fun, safe & successful season out on the big pond everyone!    Mark"
