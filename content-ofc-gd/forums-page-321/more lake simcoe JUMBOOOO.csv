775366,Angel_Fish,2013-03-24 09:44:00,6,"I like this lake.  Its always been hit or miss depending on what time of day, but we always seen to get into the Perch on Simcoe.  Just this weekend we went to catch some Good Friday dinner and after watching my buddies catch little bugger after little bugger....I finally landed my 3rd perch.  12.5"" too.  Biggest one out of all us for the season.  I always seem to catch just enough for dinner and the biggest one of the bunch.  Boys, its a woman's intuition thing.  I hope I can get out next weekend too!  "
