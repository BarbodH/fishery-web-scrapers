775138,camillj,2013-03-22 06:48:00,1988,Not sure if its just me .. but winter flew by so fast I almost feel like I missed it ... only got a couple meaningful trips onto the ice ... so here I am wondering .... do I wait till the boat gets launched (and get busy until then - like I haven't been already) ............. or ......... do I fill-er-up and head north tomorrow for some last ditch ice efforts in the Muskokas .... anyone up in the Joe/Rosseau are please chime in ..... orrrrrrrrr .... do I go check out my brand spanking new 1600 acre claim up north of huntsville and start running dirt  ....ok  I admit it ... I now have TWO reasons to be scouting out new creeks
775140,porkpie,2013-03-22 10:15:00,2521,"If ever the question to go or not go comes up, I ask myself 2 questions.  Is it safe to do so?  And will I  regret not going?  If the answer to question 1 is yes, inevitably the answer to question 2 will be yes.  I choose to save myself the disappointment, pack the car, and go fishing!!  Good luck!"
775148,aplumma,2013-03-22 12:28:00,6896,Take a break and run up North you deserve it. A week off will not kill the business and you can catch up when you get back.   Art
775153,Lunkerhunter,2013-03-22 12:45:00,455,lots of ice still out there. get your gear together and go!
775156,Rich,2013-03-22 13:02:00,3927,You'll never catch anythig if you don't give er!!
775163,irishfield,2013-03-22 14:06:00,26272,"22"" of ice on Temgagami! Some stuff further South of there is running pretty fast and wide... stay away from any moving water and you'll be just fine!"
775181,Sinker,2013-03-22 15:56:00,8692,Silly question!! Of course you should go!!  S.
775187,Jigger,2013-03-22 16:23:00,1237,Pretty sound reasoning right there.

775241,davey buoy,2013-03-22 23:40:00,5505,"x4,what a way to break it down. I like it. lol."
775262,dhickey,2013-03-23 01:06:00,1038,I always regret not going even if there is a question about safety... If you dont go you wont know! That is what drives me crazy. Not knowing...  GO
775291,camillj,2013-03-23 13:09:00,1988,Thanks ...guess who's  packing the car as we speak ....
