775350,myot,2013-03-24 01:53:00,131,Does anyone know if there's minnows for sale anywhere in the Kawatha's at 7am tomorrow heading to the Kawartha Highlands and need some bait  Dan
775367,fishindevil,2013-03-24 10:56:00,6254,Kawartha bait & tackle right downtown Lindsay right beside the dam and the locks but I don't think they are open at 7am ?? Or you can try the bait shop in minden I think they are open pretty early ?? There is also a guy in fenelon falls a very small tackle shop before the bridge he might be open as well !!!! Marks wormwharehouse is not open in bobcaygeon yet for the season so you are kinda limited for now. !!!! Good luck

The MNR has put restrictions on bait shops that sell minnows some are not even going to bother as they have to trap them only in certain areas for certain watersheds to prevent transfer of VHS and other species
