Setting up the portable was like flying a kite, drilled a hole there was a good 14 inches of ice.  Dropped a minnow down and within seconds got one. For 2 hours it was the same thing, the only reason I didnt have a bite in 10 seconds was if the previous fish took the minnow.  Took home 12 bigger then the average this year for some dinner and freezer. Might get out again on Saturday."
