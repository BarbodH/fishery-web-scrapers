760149,Handlebarz,2013-01-17 21:23:00,3790,Hey guys I know some were wondering about Musky Sunday This year it is not going to happen due to the fact that muskies Canada will be running the Odyssey It will most likely return next year.  As for the Odyssey I thought I would let everybody know or remind the ones who found out last time you can buy advanced tickets for it at $15 or $20 at the door this is family pricing that means you and your spouse and children get in under one ticket. It's free parking and a great location just off the QEW.  I will also be running a contest before the Odyssey I have to talk with the boss about how to run it you will have to show up at my booth to collect your winnings. For the price I'm sure it will be four of my baits one of each style I make.

I figure i will pick them up for him at the ODY if he gives you enough notice. Ben is starting to carry some Muskie gear now. He had quite a few people asking for lures last year.  Cheers, Ron..."
