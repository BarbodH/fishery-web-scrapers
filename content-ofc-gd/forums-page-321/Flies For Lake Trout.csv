774555,4x4bassin,2013-03-19 15:54:00,1025,I read in a previous post about lake trout flies and this really stirred my intrest. I always like to try different things while fishing and I am intrested in the technique of trolling a fly or a spoon with a fly trailer for lake trout on my annual spring getaway  . I like the look of a fly in the water and I think it would really work on my lake ! Is there anyone here that uses this technique with success that could give me some tips and where is there a good place to get some of these minnow flies in central Ontario .  Thanks

774564,4x4bassin,2013-03-19 16:32:00,1025,"I forgot to mention that I would be using a standard spinning or casting outfit while trolling these flies and thanks Driffter for the encouragement with this pattern , those flies look great (as well as the laker)"

775103,jeffw,2013-03-22 01:38:00,267,Some of the sail stores have some flies that would work for lakers. Flymart.ca is also a good place to buy flies in canada. Cheers jeff
