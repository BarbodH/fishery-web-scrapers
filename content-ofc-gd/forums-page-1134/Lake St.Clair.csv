123640,Squid,2007-10-15 19:48:00,1656,"I was just looking at the water temps for LSC and it is showing temperatures in the 40 to 45 degree range, BRRRRR!!!"
123642,misfish,2007-10-15 19:52:00,29133,"Great temps for a polar bear dip,wouldnt ya think Pete? I,ll let you go first. HAHAHAHA"
123644,Joey,2007-10-15 19:57:00,9122,"Yikes, that's frigit Pete.  Could be icing up soon eh  Joey"
123646,Raf,2007-10-15 20:00:00,3495, that can't be right.  water was mid 60s on gbay last wknd.  not sure what you were looking at but maybe cloud cover skewed the temps.
123650,jamz6789,2007-10-15 20:12:00,1,That temperature is hard to believe...Lake Erie was over 70 degrees Farenheit on Thanksgiving weekend...just 8 days ago.
123655,LeXXington,2007-10-15 20:23:00,1928,Lower Niagra was 63
123661,steverowbotham,2007-10-15 20:36:00,1800,Simcoe was 59.8-62.4 yesterday
123710,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-15 22:27:00,0,Temps on Gbay are 59 to 60 as of yesterday out on the big water. In shallow water it's cooler at 56. Last week it was 66 out on the big water.  Waters cooling off fast..!!! Finally!!!. Still very warm for this time of year!
123722,Aaron Shirley,2007-10-15 22:50:00,655,That can't be correct.  I was on Lake Erie (Port Colborne) this Sunday for smallies and the surface temp was 63 F.  I would check that info again.  Aaron
123726,Krisco,2007-10-15 22:57:00,67,"68 degs yesterday from the mouth of the Detroit River all the way out to Belle River, must be a misprint Pete."
123756,Handlebarz,2007-10-15 23:54:00,3790,Pete I would say it will be 65 here give or take 1 it did spike before the warm weather up to 71 again but with the cold of last week it will be around 65 again so are ya comin down?
123764,Squid,2007-10-16 00:01:00,1656,Yeah maybe it was the cloud cover over the lake. It showed Erie at 60-64 degrees.
123769,Squid,2007-10-16 00:04:00,1656,Went back to the site and it looks like it was a reading with cloudiness.  http://www.coastwatch.msu.edu/erie/e10.html
123820,irishfield,2007-10-16 01:59:00,26272,Lake Temagami is still 57.2*F...and the Lakers are still hiding down at 40 to 60 feet. Be awhile yet before they hit the shoals to spawn. Ice is a ways off yet Pete...I hope!
123873,Whopper,2007-10-16 06:45:00,2174,"Lake Erie a week ago Sunday was 71, this past Sunday it was 63 near the islands area."
