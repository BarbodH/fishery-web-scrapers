123682,Nater,2007-10-15 21:37:00,68,"chances are if you hook a fish in the mouth it is going to come up to the top of the water and headshake...there is a noticeable feel when a fish is shakkign it's head back and forth that can't be mistaken.  You put a hook anywhere else on a fish it's most likely just gonna rip around the pool and your line will be vibrating.  Headshake feels alot different compared to a fish hooked in the arse  Break off your fish that are snagged, far better chance they will survive and whoever thought that you need stronger line for bigger fish was clearly an idiot...anything over 8lb in most lake ontario rivers is complete overkill and un-neccessary, just because the fish weighs 20 lbs doesnt mean you need 20 lb line  Nate"
123685,Milty,2007-10-15 21:48:00,121,"  Unless the hook is within 1-2"" of the mouth, it is quite easy to tell if it foul or fair,...comes through experience really,..headshakes vs a sideways struggle is one sure way,...  regarding the debate over whether the fish should be fought and released properly if foul hooked or just broken off,....there really should be no debate,..the regs are wrong,....if you hook a fish legit in the mouth you can play it out and land and release, or even keep it...no problem....if it is hooked in the tail of belly,...apprarently playing it out and releasing it tires the fish out too much and it will die,..am I missing something?  Not too mention what these fish go through to get to where they are going can involve 10000x more energy than a 5 minute fight.  As for the fish swimming around with a hook stuck in it and line etc trailing,..well If someone was fishing properly ,..it would be a #12-14 tiny hook and maybe 2-3' of 6lb lead,..not that big a deal since the hooks are supposed to work their way out in a day or 2.  Probably the most important point is that any experienced steelheader will tell u there are many ways to AVOID fould hooking a fish.  Just My $0.02"
123687,Milty,2007-10-15 21:49:00,121,"  Thanks Nate,..took the words right out of my mouth,...somewhat...lol,....I landed a 25lb nook on 4lb drennan lead,...quality is quality!!!"
123699,solopaddler,2007-10-15 22:07:00,8605," The original poster Fishing For Life made reference to using a roe bag so I assumed he was talking about river fishing for trout and salmon. Of course you're right Rick if you're talking about virtually any other type of fishing. As far as migratory trout and salmon go though, it is very easy to tell if the fish is fouled, and yes I do believe the angler should break the fish off once it's determined to be snagged, for reasons already mentioned. Although, by law you're not required to do so.... Nothing wrong with a healthy debate  ."

123799,Nater,2007-10-16 01:05:00,68,well seeing as a fish can't feel the pain of a hook being set into it's mouth I highly doubt it feels anymore pain when hooked anywhere else on the body.  Fish don't have quite the same nervous system as us and beleive it or not they are very efficient of getitng hoosk stuck in their body out. and the ones that they can't get out will rust out on their own eventually  Bottom line you snag a fish break it off and suck up your loss of a 15 cent hook  Nate
