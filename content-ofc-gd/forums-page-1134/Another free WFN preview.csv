123864,Weeds,2007-10-16 04:45:00,782,"Yeah, alot of repeats. The best is ""Fishing University""; everybody on the show sounds just like boomhauer from king of the hill. Next time it's on, just close your eyes and listen. Hilarity ensues."
123867,Badger Shark,2007-10-16 04:53:00,291,I agree there are alot of repeating programs and it seems alot of the topics are about salmon fishing.  I would like to see more topical fishing shows about what is hot at this time of year.  Example would be walleye fishing heating up.  In the winter ice fishing of course etc....
