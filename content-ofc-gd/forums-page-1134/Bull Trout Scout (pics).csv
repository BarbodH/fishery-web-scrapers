123394,KyleM,2007-10-15 02:03:00,218,"Well with the weather being as nice as it has been since I moved out to Grande Prairie, Alberta a few months ago I thought I would take a tour around our area to check for some of this amazing Bull Trout and Rainbow water Ive been hearing about. Filled up the gas tank at $107/L   and I was on my way towards Grande Cache.  Grande Cache is located 2 hours from Grande Prairie but you hit the prime waters well before the town. So about an hour into the drive I pulled over and started taking some pictures.  There is literally nothing between the two towns accept rivers, mountains and wildlife.  I made it all the way to Grande Cache and I came across tons of prime pools that will hold some nice Bows and Bullies....marked them on my GPS and I was on my way home. Even stumbled across a couple tiny lakes with some feeder creeks.  Didnt get to many pictures but I thought I would post a couple pictures for you guys.            "
123396,Greencoachdog,2007-10-15 02:06:00,8163,Nice pics... they need fish in them!
123397,KyleM,2007-10-15 02:17:00,218,"Would love to have them but I havent checked into the regs out here yet.  Didnt even care to check, no one else is fishing so chances are everything is closed up!"
123403,Greencoachdog,2007-10-15 02:47:00,8163,  Maybe they're all lazy???
