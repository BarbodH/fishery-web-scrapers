122914,wuchikubo,2007-10-12 20:31:00,1114,"WTG Mike, those fish had some nice colours.  I'll be looking for your posts too, now."
123021,kemper,2007-10-13 16:04:00,2232,"awesome!  the steelies are just starting to show up in my trib but not in any numbers yet and the water is way to low to fool them. Although I say this the day after a huge buck broke me off after I thought I was fighting a salmon untill i came out of the water and SNAP!  I cant wait, late fall/winter steel is my favourite kind of fishing."
123059,FinS,2007-10-13 19:22:00,463,nice Mike wtg now im jealous got out last week only got a shaker
123211,Zib,2007-10-14 14:28:00,369,Awesome pics. Nice job.
123292,Mike the Pike,2007-10-14 21:55:00,3421,Nice shiners Solo too bad you didn't get a pic of the 10 pounder.  MTP
123402,MJL,2007-10-15 02:38:00,2427,"Awesome pics.  Though I'm too busy during steelhead season to get out, I get through my day with pics like these (And fondling my float gear...Which I won't go in any further detail)"
122558,solopaddler,2007-10-11 19:30:00,8605,"With the recent trips up to the cabin and the major issue of my friend Kareem being sick, today was the first chance I had to sneak out and do some steelheading. As most of you guys know this is a sport of timing: they're migratory fish and a slave to weather and water conditions. Hit the river on the rise or hit it on the drop if you expect to have good success. The internet is an amazing tool for steelheaders, there's just so much current info available. Graphs with your favourite river's flow rate in real time are right at the top of the valuable info heap... After years of fishing this particular watershed and looking at the flow rates and weather forecast, I knew today would be good. It was  . I was by myself today, so really just have a fraction of the fish caught captured on film. I hit this spunky little skipper on my 2nd drift. As it turns out it was by far the smallest of the day.  Release  The fight  Another release  A few more...       Wish I had more pic's, but c'est la vie  . At one point I had a gorgeous buck in the 10lb class right up to my feet and while I was fumbling with the camera it got off (it happens a lot when you're solo  ). The fish were very aggressive today and were caught mostly on large chartreuse and pink roe bags. (choker bags as I like to call 'em  ). Also hit a bunch of fish on worms and one on a hot pink marabou jig near the end of my day when I was just fooling around.  Great morning and early afternoon to work the kinks out!  cheers,  Mike"
122559,bassmaster4,2007-10-11 19:33:00,801,nice fish
122561,Sherriff,2007-10-11 19:37:00,252,Awesome report Solo.  Were the rivers busy or were you lucky enough to spend some fishing time alone?  Thanks Sherriff
122563,Darek,2007-10-11 19:38:00,20,"nice ""catfish"""
122566,misfish,2007-10-11 19:46:00,29133,Awesome colours Henry.HAHA Nice fish. I thought with the bang in the title you may of been fishing by some duck hunters.   TFS
122569,ccmtcanada,2007-10-11 20:02:00,7971,"Wow!!! Great report Mike....awesome pics...been a while since I've seen pretty fish like that.  Next time your spidey senses tingle, let me know....LOL.  Thanks for the invite...(esp after reading this report), but hopefully we'll hook up at a later date."
122570,tbayboy,2007-10-11 20:03:00,1497,"Wonderful colours  on those fish, sounds like a great morning.  Congrats and thanks for sharing"
122571,solopaddler,2007-10-11 20:04:00,8605," If you're implying what I think you're implying, guess again. Wasn't anywhere near that river  ."
122572,solopaddler,2007-10-11 20:06:00,8605," It's a long season Cliff, plenty of time to get out."
122573,solopaddler,2007-10-11 20:10:00,8605," Saw 2 other guys, and that was from a distance. Normal for a weekday depending on where you're fishing."
122574,Whopper,2007-10-11 20:19:00,2174,"Great looking fish Mike! Something I've never done, maybe someday though.  Glad to see you spend a great morning/afternoon on the water  Thanks for sharing!  Whopper"

122727,blaque,2007-10-12 12:03:00,2419,"Wow , great day.....  By the way, thanks for being candid about the hinted tributary you guys are eluding to lol. Seriosuly though, this is my home stream , and us guys down on the south shore get a warm and fuzzy when seeing that it is respected and not ""advertised"" by our good friends to the north.  Good to see it wont get any ""internet abuse"" on this forum.  Nice fish paddler, we wont have any rising or falling waters in my area for quite a while from teh looks of things"
122737,Moosebunk,2007-10-12 12:47:00,3970,"And so it begins Mike, a whole new season for ya.  Good start."
122744,lew,2007-10-12 12:59:00,12767,"Another great day on the water for you Mike, I always look forward to your river reports."
122755,Bly,2007-10-12 13:13:00,1556,Nice way to start a season!  Always like the pictures you take.  Keep up the good work!
122756,tonyb,2007-10-12 13:14:00,1637,Great fishing Mike! It is that wonderful time of year again...  The water had a perfect J-9 tinge  Tony
