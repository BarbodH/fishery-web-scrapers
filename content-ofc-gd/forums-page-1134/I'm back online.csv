I started having problems with this site, then it started on other sites too, and it turns out it was nothing to do with Rogers, but Internet Explorer. I was on the phone with them for 1 1/2 hours this afternoon while they tried different things, including issues with Runtime Errors and they finally narrowed it down to a faulty Google Toolbar that was causing all the problems.  It was resolved by IE and now everything is working perfectly again.  Please don't ask me to explain what the issue was, as most of what he described to me may as well have been spoken in a foreign language, and all that matters to me is that now things are working properly"
