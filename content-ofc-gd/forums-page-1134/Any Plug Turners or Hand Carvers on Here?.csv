123308,FishHeadRic,2007-10-14 22:25:00,226,Since I've gotten back here I've kind of taken on to some lure building. I belong to another website that has a plug turning and lure building section.  I've built some lures before but this site made me realize how easy it all is as long as you have a basic set up. Last week I purchased a lathe and so far what I've been turning out has been exellent.  I've also hand carved some lures in the past that worked great for me. Just wondering if any of you have a lathe or have lures that you've built and want to post em. I'd like to see some of the work being done here by other members.  FHR

I purchased a lathe, small band saw, belt sander, drill press, router and a air brush, started with a scroll saw but a band saw is much better for making musky/pike stuff, and a load of sandpaper and elbow grease will get the job done.  I want to start hand carving walleye lures with bass wood too, one things for sure if you don't have any wood lures your missing out, the action is amazing."
