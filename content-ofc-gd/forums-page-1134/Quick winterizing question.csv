I hear people using there boats on the niagara in mid winter."
123266,glen,2007-10-14 20:25:00,2641,The problems are [1] brake down or water in the gas. [2] Water in the motor freezing.  For [1] you could add some gas line antifreeze.  For [2] Change your lower unit oil to be sure it is free of water. When you pull the boat out of the water. Tilt your motor up and down to drain the water. Turn the motor over without starting to clear the water from the impeller.

Once it starts getting cold, I change my gear lube more frequently, just so I KNOW there is no water in there to freeze, and crack the housing.  Just let the engine drain in the down position before you leave the launch on below zero days, and you'll be fine.  Water is the devil when it comes to operating your outboard in below zero weather. Water expands, and cracks whatever is containing it.......make sure it all drains out, and that your lower unit isn't leaking any water into it.  Gasline antifreeze is always a good idea in an outboard in cold weather as well. I've had my carb freeze up, and it sucks when its cold and windy!!  Sinker"
