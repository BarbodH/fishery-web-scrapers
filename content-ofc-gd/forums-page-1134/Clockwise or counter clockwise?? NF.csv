123457,huey graphite,2007-10-15 11:37:00,362,"At 1st I was unable to see anything but CW but after covering her upper  body as suggested and focusing for about a minute, I was able to get it to switch to CCW and then when I uncovered the upper body it continued CCW. I was then able to switch Cw to CCW at will.  Cool!"
123459,motv8tr,2007-10-15 11:42:00,2587,No matter what I do I only see a clockwise direction...guess I'm too narrow minded for this   Maureen
123470,blaque,2007-10-15 12:52:00,2419,Good thing you mentioned covering up the top half. Cuz i couldnt make the switch till you said that. I got it though. Although i cant switch it back and forth unless i cover her top half still.
123479,Deano,2007-10-15 13:27:00,767,"Stare at it long enough and you'll see two, then they will start to appear to be dancing.  Gotta go take some Tylenol now. LOL"
123481,ccmtcanada,2007-10-15 13:30:00,7971, Now how can you tell that just from this?  Oh...wait...you meant how she turns....hehe  For me...clockwise only.
123487,wallyboss,2007-10-15 13:38:00,1095,I must be in trouble cause she is standing still!!!!
123488,wuchikubo,2007-10-15 13:39:00,1114,"Hmm, I can only see CW. Right leg leads in the turn while looking from above, vertical axis from the sky. From below, sure CCW but I will keep trying to see it with portions covered up, tried once already, still CW.  The R-leg keeps telling me it's CW."
123491,Terry,2007-10-15 13:46:00,14456,"try coving all but the tip of her head and make it go CCW..then slowly move your hand down and it will go CCW till you use your brain again like going to move the mouse, it will then go the other way... strangely enough if I just show her head I can have her going back and forth with the back of her head toward me and she never does a complete turn..."
123497,fishindevil,2007-10-15 14:09:00,6254,"WOW...if i cover her legs,i can see her going CW....but if i uncover her i still only see CCW..???? wierd,but freaky"
123501,Fishnfiend,2007-10-15 14:20:00,357,"Clockwise only, no matter what I try.    VERY weird, because I am typically left-brained.  I guess, coming on OFC to escape the grind of daily life is working!"
123514,keram,2007-10-15 14:42:00,585,She is turning ???. I only see her jumping every couple seconds LOL
123524,swiebe,2007-10-15 15:16:00,18,"Clockwise, when viewed from above."
123364,danc,2007-10-15 01:16:00,4677,Which way is this dancer turning? Simple question. Right??  
123367,douG,2007-10-15 01:20:00,2693,Gotta be CCW.  Thanks so much for asking.
123368,Clampet,2007-10-15 01:22:00,1947,CCW?
123370,John Bacon,2007-10-15 01:24:00,3277,Clockwise when viewed from above; counter clockwise when viewed from below.
123373,Terry,2007-10-15 01:30:00,14456,ok that's  freaky  I swear I will never smoke that stuff again
123374,Clampet,2007-10-15 01:30:00,1947," How about the side view we are shown here, isn't it CCW?"
123375,douG,2007-10-15 01:31:00,2693,"Nope.  As long as her head is up, she is spinning ccw.  I can't see the other."
123376,danc,2007-10-15 01:35:00,4677,"If clockwise, then you use more of the right side of the brain and vice versa.  Most of us would see the dancer turning anti-clockwise though you can try to focus and change the direction; see if you can do it."
123378,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-15 01:38:00,698,I can only see clockwise.
123379,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-15 01:39:00,1183,CCW...I spin like that every night
123381,Clampet,2007-10-15 01:41:00,1947, One good turn...................gets most of the sheets!
123383,MJL,2007-10-15 01:42:00,2427,For me it switches between CCW and CW and back every 10 seconds or so.
123385,mason05,2007-10-15 01:43:00,258,If you follow the shadow and turn your head/eyes at the right time she'll swing side to side or CW to CCW. Nice head trip DanC  Corn Nug
123391,Greencoachdog,2007-10-15 01:55:00,8163, Ditto!!!  Actually it's very amazing because I see it changing too!  ... does this mean me and MJL are usin' both sides of our brain?
123398,fishindevil,2007-10-15 02:17:00,6254,COOL MAN !!!! i see her turning counterclockwise....freaky
123399,spanky,2007-10-15 02:18:00,195,i only see her moving clockwise.... maybe i need some cheeba or something?
123411,Sinker,2007-10-15 03:06:00,8692,clockwise for me.....?
123412,Joey,2007-10-15 03:16:00,9122,"Clockwise here too, I'll try to see if It will change for me.  Joey  Freaky..... okay, she goes both ways now"
123414,Beats,2007-10-15 03:18:00,543,yeah I too only see clockwise spinning.  I don't see CCW at all.  Is it supposed to be an optical illusion like how if you stare at a moving cars tires they appear to be going the correct way for a few seconds and then appear to change and go the other?
123415,danc,2007-10-15 03:19:00,4677,"Cover her upper body so that you only see her legs swinging about. When I do that I can imagine her turning any which way that I want and when I uncover her body, she is turning the way that I imagined."
123419,Beats,2007-10-15 03:24:00,543,"  I just did that and after a few seconds it worked for me.  I regularly only see clockwise.  After covering the feet and convincing myself to see CCW I  finally saw the switch.  After that, took my hand off the body and it spun the other way."
123437,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-15 07:47:00,1183,Tried all the suggestions and she is still going CCW...the queen!  I won't give up though cuz I have to know that I am using both sides of my brain.
123440,SlowPoke,2007-10-15 07:57:00,2984,All I see is a nice pair of.... legs! Mind if I use that picture for my signature???
123444,misfish,2007-10-15 09:41:00,29133,"Stop,he,s just brain washing you all,it,s a northern cult thing. HEhe    I never noticed   She goes both ways."
123446,Terry,2007-10-15 10:19:00,14456,sometimes I can just think about it and see changes direction
