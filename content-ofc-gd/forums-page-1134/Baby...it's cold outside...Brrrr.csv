Beans took me to a spot were we fished for a while.. caught a couple of bass then moved to another spot... nothing then went over to another spot.. lots for weeds... wind started to pick up so we went over to a sheltered bay and fished... went in to have brunch  then it was time for me to leave and head back to the Hammer  .  Thanks Norm and Marybeth for a great and Hospitable time  I really enjoyed myself even if we didn't get out in the boat Saturday.. at least we played around with the fish...
