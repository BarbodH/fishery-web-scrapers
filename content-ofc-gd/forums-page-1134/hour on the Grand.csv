123085,fatherof3,2007-10-13 22:04:00,1769,Had an hour to kill before supper so thought I would go to my spot.I have not gone down in a few days so just wanted to get out.Was nice weather but a little windy at times.   Within 10 minutes this guy decided to bite.   As you can tell from the second pic he didn't like me holding him and decided to give me some dirty clothes for it.After him I caught these two.   That was pretty much it and had to head home for supper.Not bad for an hour.
