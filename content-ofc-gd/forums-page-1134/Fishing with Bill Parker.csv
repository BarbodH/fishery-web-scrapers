122958,Corey,2007-10-13 01:18:00,355,"Well, hooked up with Bill to go see what was happening at pond X. We strapped Bill's nice new electric trolling motor onto a little (but very nice) 12' aluminum boat at the side of the pond and launched. From there we cruised to one side of the pond and not 5 seconds after casting his line, fish on! We continued for a few hours hitting a bunch of hammer handles and various bass in the 2-3 pound range.  It was a nice relaxing outting with about 20-25 fish over about 3 hours of fishing. All of my fish were caught on gulp plastics and Bill got a bunch on spinnerbaits and plastic frogs.  In addition to that, we got to hammer out a good game plan for BOQ, we'll be catching the most fish that weekend.  Bill should be posting pics later on of some of the nicer fish we caught.  Thanks for the good times Bill."
