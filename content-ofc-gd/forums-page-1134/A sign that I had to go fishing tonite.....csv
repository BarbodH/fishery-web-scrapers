Well, one of the things I had to do was go to the grocery store.  With my 5 year old in tow, we walked past the meat department when something caught my eye.  As I walked past this display, I felt as if the things were staring at me!!!  Here's a pic....decide for yourself....   Well, that did it for me....they were telling me to go trout fishing tonight!! I swear...I heard them say it!!!  Anyhow, bly is tying some roe bags as I type this....I'll put the little one to bed, and then we'll head to a trib somewhere.....  Hopefully we'll have something to report later."
