Floroucarbon is not way more invisible than mono. No wonder I caught a lot of fish without having to use Florocarbon or braided line.  Some superline is not any stronger than mono line, and the knot strength is not that good.  Flouro line does not seem to be that good overall.  Conclusion: can't go wrong sticking to just mono line."

123150,Guest skeeter99,2007-10-14 02:21:00,0,"have to agree with the chart except I dont know where *knot strength* numbers come from  all of those lines should be  1 or  2  a palomar Knot on any of those lines will break at 125% to 140% of the lines strentgh so usually your line will snap before the knot actually breaks your line  mono is as good a flourocarbon, but flourocarbon is easily cut by zebra mussels and rocks were mono is much better at not breaking"
123217,Dano,2007-10-14 14:58:00,719,"Without more specifics, this chart really means nothing. What methods did they use to run these tests to get to these conclusions? All line has its time and place."
123284,Mike the Pike,2007-10-14 21:46:00,3421,Mono and braid may have the same strenghth but braid is much more resistant to abrasions and it will out last mono any day not to mention alot less line twisting.I was a mono guy before but braid has changed the way I fish.Mono is old technology.  MTP
123392,MJL,2007-10-15 01:55:00,2427,"Fluorocarbon ranked 1 and Mono ranked 2 in the visibility category. Technically doesn't that mean that Fluorocarbon is twice as invisible as mono? (mathematically speaking of course)  If a superline was tested in the same diameter as the mono tested, would the results be any different?  Too many unknown variables to make a conclusive statements about the various classes of lines IMO"
123409,HTHM,2007-10-15 02:57:00,4082,"on overall performance according to the chart, when you add up the totals superline is the better of mono by 2. 16 as opposed to 18. However one must know more about methodology in order to interpret the numbers better."
