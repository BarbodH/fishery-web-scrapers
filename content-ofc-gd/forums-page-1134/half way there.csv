The water temp is coming down so the bait fish are coming out of the creeks and the stripers , blues and albies are coming in to feast on them. I have never caught an albie ( false albacore) . I did get two nice blues Saturday night. On sunday morning I hooked into an albie what a thrill . I wasn't able to landed it . This fish took off like a rocket it took 100 yrds off my reel in second. I was able to get all the line back but make no no further ground back until it went on anothter run almost as long as the first one. I can't wait till this weekend to try again.  I saw a few fish landed but most of the anglers had the same  experience as I did ."
