I really believe that I'm coming to the end of my fishing days, period. I get too busy at home, then we like to go camping. And I dont like cold weather fishing. Still having jaunts to do some shoreline fishing to relax a bit, but I think I've had it.  Probably burned out after fishing 5/6 hrs a day for 5 yrs at the trailer park when I retired.  Not leaving the 'Board as I still enjoy most of the reports and Queries, so I'll still be around to put my 02c in.[Occasionally LOL]"

123430,KyleM,2007-10-15 03:56:00,218,Everyone needs a break. If you need to take some time from fishing to enjoy it more in the future then good for you!  I never get tired of other peoples reports and chatter about fishing!
123434,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-15 07:36:00,1183,Variety is the spice o life!  I agree with KyleM...and never close the door completely on anything.
