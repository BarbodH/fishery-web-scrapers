123559,Beans,2007-10-15 17:07:00,3339,"Hey Scootch...""Believe"" is the motto of The Sick Children's Hospital in Toronto and we use it in our signatures to remind us of the battle Chris (son of OFNer Rob) has had several times with cancer...  You might have read the post earlier about Chris and his sister and his dad on a fishing trip with Aaron Shirley...  WTG Keram...you beat me to it !"
