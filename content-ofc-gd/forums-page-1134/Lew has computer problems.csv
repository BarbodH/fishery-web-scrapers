123566,Squid,2007-10-15 17:29:00,1656,Lew went to open up OFC and it would not load. All other websites worked fine. Rogers told him to restore defaults and now nothing works   . He gets a run time error on his system. Windows 2000 explorer 6 is his system. Can anyone help?? I will call him with info to help him out.
123569,Badger Shark,2007-10-15 17:36:00,291,"Lew I had the same problem all weekend, I thought it was my computer but every other site worked.  It seems fine now though."
123571,Terry,2007-10-15 17:43:00,14456,make sure he goes into tools in iexplorer then internet options then the connections tab then lan setings then auto detect connections .....that might work make sure he isn't using a proxy sever
123578,JustinHoffman,2007-10-15 17:46:00,482,"This site wouldn't load for me for the last three or four hours - all other sites worked fine. I don't think it was a problem with his system, but moreso, this site.  Justin"
123579,ccmtcanada,2007-10-15 17:50:00,7971,Anyone having these problems on Rogers Hi Speed Cable?  We are having the same issue at home and have opened a work ticket with Rogers to investigate.  They have identified it as a problem on their end and will resolve as soon as possible.  We had the customer support guy actually view the old thread that was discussed on our board and has forwarded that information to the tech guys.  My home computer cannot access this site at all...I'm currently viewing from work.
123582,fatherof3,2007-10-15 17:51:00,1769,Rogers was messed up all morning here too but think it is fixed now.
123583,JustinHoffman,2007-10-15 17:53:00,482,"I run Rogers High Speed. Today was the first time I have had any issues with this site, and as I said, it wouldn't load for 3 or 4 hours, but is working fine now.  Justin"
123585,Squid,2007-10-15 17:56:00,1656,Yep he is on rogers hig speed.
123587,ccmtcanada,2007-10-15 17:58:00,7971," Just let him know that they have known about this issue since yesterday and are working on fixing the problem...hopefully it's resolved soon...at least I can log in at work....  As I said, they have admitted it's an issue at their end."
123590,Squid,2007-10-15 18:04:00,1656,"Thanks Cliff, I mentioned exactly that to Lew and he is calling them right now."
123596,ccmtcanada,2007-10-15 18:13:00,7971, Tell him to reference the following work tickets if he's having problems with them....  Ticket #WSR02084891 and case# 28340745
123597,Tdel,2007-10-15 18:15:00,393,"I was just checking out OFC this afternoon and everything was working well until about 30 minutes ago, nothing would load for me. Everything timed out.  I don't have Rogers Hi Speed so this might just be a coincidence that this happened to me at this time.  I shut everthing down and pulled the plug on my Hi Speed DSL modem.   I waited about 10 minutes before I reconnected everything and all is working well again.  Tom."
123606,lazybum,2007-10-15 18:27:00,142,At 2:27pm on Sympatico we don't have any problems. Didn't notice any problems earlier either.
123621,Headhunter,2007-10-15 19:00:00,5703,"There was a malicious ""Worm"" mentioned in the paper today, could it be that, which is tying up bandwidth across the net? HH"
123624,misfish,2007-10-15 19:02:00,29133,"BELL,Im not a salesmen. LOL  Sorry for your troubles Lew."
123626,ccmtcanada,2007-10-15 19:05:00,7971,Things are working at home again....glad we called yesterday to let them know about it.  Hopefully everyone else is up and running soon.
