122906,suds,2007-10-12 20:06:00,70,"HI all, I am hoping a few of the hunter types here can help me out. I have been scouring MNR websites, and OFAH and I am still confused. My father is coming out from B.C. to hunt birds next week and so we know he needs a non resident small game license (correct?) Anyone know where these are sold in Toronto North? I assumed BPS, but I can't get anyone on the phone who knows- its classic voice mail jail!  Can he legally transport his firearms with only the hunting license? I know you can in B.C. and Alberta, but I can't figure it out here.  Also, can anyone send me any info about  hunter instruction course instructors? Or does anyone know one? I emailed several directly from OFAH website a while back, but have heard nothing. I can legally hunt in B.C. and AB, but not here until I challenge the course. Sounds like a cash grab for sure!  Thanks in advance- appreciate any info you have PM if you like  cheers suds"

122929,wallyboss,2007-10-12 22:05:00,1095,I think that most Canadian Tires sell them!!!
122934,ch312,2007-10-12 22:26:00,1590,"he can bring all of his guns if he wants to.  and yes im pretty sure you can get the non res small game at canadian tire. if not, theres an office in guelph that you should try calling..."
122942,fishinfool,2007-10-12 23:23:00,366,"Small Game license is correct and Canadian Tire for sure, that's where I always get mine. Call Jim Novakowski at 905 240 0087 (Oshawa area) and if he does not teach the course you are looking for, he will be able to tell you where or who...  Good Luck"
122943,Fisherman,2007-10-12 23:41:00,7201,"For the important question, No. At minimum you require a current (POL) Possession Only Licence or current (PAL) Possession and Acquisition Licence.  The amnesty for non restricted long guns, (rifle/shotgun) has been extended to May 2008, so unless you run into some ornery old phallic protrusion, the POL/PAL should be okay."
122988,Fishmaster,2007-10-13 13:01:00,920,FAC & Hunting Licence call Tim Green Dunnville Ont (905)774-3458 the best teacher i no in Ontario
122990,Reelsmokin,2007-10-13 13:09:00,5,its best to call the regional MNR office for the area you intend to hunt.  some divisions have additional license requirements. i think they are around 12 bucks.  Reelsmokin
