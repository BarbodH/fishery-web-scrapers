123228,lunkerbasshunter,2007-10-14 16:29:00,2585,im sitting here reading this with my 18month old son watching him eat his lunch.  I cant tell you how much i feel for you and your family.  I also cant tell you how much emotion is running through my body as I watch my son.  Instead of a football sunday i think it will be a daddy and son sunday.  All the best in this time of rememberance.
123231,duckdog,2007-10-14 16:44:00,162,"Man, I just read the first post, I am sitting here in tears, I am so sorry to hear about your son, I have a 9 month old and that just hit me hard. I have been a long term alcoholic and bin in trouble with the police including swat a few years back, I found out I was having a son and went to rehab 2weeks over a year ago today, I just can't beleive how some things work I have lost quite a few friends and family members in the last few years, My heart goes out to you, the thought that you can even bring that up makes me proud of you, may all our strength be with you. I am not a praying man but I sure will throw one out there for you tonight"
122052,HTHM,2007-10-10 03:11:00,4082,"I trust that you will find your comfort not in a bottle or herb, but in God's word. You are in my prayers"
122054,Golfisher,2007-10-10 03:15:00,586,"I wasn't aware of this tragic loss, but like everyone else, I hope you are remembering your son with more fondness than sadness.  Be strong, as always."
122056,bpsbassman,2007-10-10 03:25:00,941,"Gerritt, Stay strong and be comforted that your boy is in a better place. Even though he lived such a short life, look at all the people he has affected here. You and your family will be in my prayers."
122064,Beans,2007-10-10 03:57:00,3339,Five years already ?...I can remember the morning I read your post and couldn't believe what I was reading...for once old Beans-talk-a-lot was speechless...I also remember how hard it was replying to your post...kept choking up and tears kept welling...  That whole experience resulted in me receiving the feeling that I didn't just join another fishing board but became a member of the OFC family...  God bless you and yours Gerritt.
122066,Musky or Specks,2007-10-10 04:07:00,2710,"Gerritt my heart goes out to you and your family. Be strong for them,they will be strong for you and together you will get through tommorow."

122080,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-10 08:31:00,1183,"I believe that love does not die...it just can't - I guess that's why we who are still here continue with that longing to be reunited with all those that have touched and made our hearts what they are.  Of course you will continue to make room for him and will continue to imagine all the wonderful things that could have been because you love him and it's very much you still keeping in touch with him and showing him that he will always be a huge part of your life.  As much as today will bring you sadness, I hope it will bring you peace knowing that one sweet day you will be together.  God Bless."
122082,Roy,2007-10-10 08:37:00,13728,"I also remember it well, Gerritt. God love you and your family."

122106,kayak fisher,2007-10-10 12:12:00,66,"Hey Gerritt,  What an extremely sobering thought.  I too am new to this board, but I would like to extend my regards to you and your family today.  I don't have any children, and I can only imagine how you feel. I am very sorry to hear of your loss."
122107,Steve,2007-10-10 12:14:00,2075,"there are a few days on this board that will stay in my heart forever.  The day you lost your son and the day LEW lost his.  I still to this day keep both in my thoughts.  Lots has changed around here in the last five years, but the core group hasn't changed, all great folks.  Gerritt, please keep you head up, and your chin held high. Thats what your son would have wanted. I bet he'd have been a helluva hockey player!"
122108,Sherriff,2007-10-10 12:15:00,252,All the best to you and your family.....  Sherriff
122113,pikehunter,2007-10-10 12:29:00,1659,"Yes Gerritt, I too remember the sadness of that day. Time goes by all too quickly, 5 years sounds like a long time when we look into the future, but it sure goes by fast. I am sure you have many fine memories of the times you had together, keep the memories with you and he will always be there.  Take care."
122123,TJQ,2007-10-10 12:55:00,7806,Ill never forget that day either bud...  take care.

122153,Gerritt,2007-10-10 14:01:00,6129,"Thank you everyone for your words of support and understanding..  Truly the best people reside here.  Many people from OFC experienced what happened 5 years ago... They were by my side when I needed them the most.. That is why I mentioned it being 5 years today.. So noone will ever forget just how precious our kids are..Sometimes we take for granted they will be there at the end of a long day at work offering up a hug that makes all the days stresses just disappear....  But for some this is not the case...For some those hugs are not there....  Give your kids a little something extra today.. Be it a hug, a smile or just a couple more minutes to watch tv with you..  Gerritt."
122156,Jay T,2007-10-10 14:22:00,282,"I am sorry Gerritt, I was not around then either. I am so sorry for your loss 5 years ago.  Jay"

122168,camillj,2007-10-10 14:46:00,1988,"Yes my frend, life goes by too fast ! As much as these dates cause us pain, they also remind us to treasure each day... and I think we need that to keep us on track.  I know that after 35 + years ... twice a year (his birthday and the day he died) I share the emotions you must be feeling (my father was taken from me when I was 7) ... and I think, as much as it hurts to remember ... it would be so much worse to forget.  My thoughts are with you today brother."
122179,swiebe,2007-10-10 15:34:00,18,You don't know me but know that one more person shares your pain.  I forget who said this but it's something like:  pain shared is diminished and joy shared is increased.  I hope the support in this forum helps you.
122180,Headhunter,2007-10-10 15:40:00,5703,"As I have said to you personally, your strength is remarkable. You were one of the first to try and connect with me last week during my family's time of tragedy. Unfortunately, I was not around at the time to be there for you. Thanks for reminding us how important times with family and friends really is and I will give my kids an extra hug tonight when I get home. G, give Liam an extra hug tonight, you are a very special person. HH"

122215,LeXXington,2007-10-10 17:20:00,1928,My heart goes out to you and your family.
122030,huntervasili,2007-10-10 01:58:00,1604,Gerritt having heard of your son and what you and your family have been through definately teaches us all to treasure those we have with us today as they may be taken from us tomorrow. My thoughts are with you man.
122032,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-10 02:01:00,957,"Gerritt, we've been with you all along on this.  I think of him every time I see your name on the board."
122033,Squid,2007-10-10 02:02:00,1656,All the best tomorrow brother. I will hug the kids extra special tonight.
122036,DT10Sam,2007-10-10 02:13:00,480,"Gerritt I'm speechless....I was not aware that you lost your son and I am feeling terrible and have a pain in my heart for you.  I hugged our boys good night tonight as I do each night only tonight I looked at them and felt that I would be devastated if I lost one of them and now I know how you are feeling.  Hang in there and I will be thinking of you and praying for your family.  Kind regards, Sam"
