123269,superdad,2007-10-14 20:49:00,353,"Got out to fish with Laker John, launched at Shermans and  headed east of the ferry. On the way we passed a number of boats in Long Reach fishing from the cement plant to Thompsons Pt. - at least three charters.  We trolled downwind from the Three Amigos Shoal almost to Prynter Cove, we picked up a nice 22 incher opposite the lighthouse on the north shore, on a Yo Zuri Crystal Minnow (R539- Lime green top / white belly)  Motored back against the wind and started again at Keith Shoaland we stayed a little deeper until about 1300 when the wind and rain really blew up. Motored back to Thompsons and fished in the lee of the west shore.  The charters were still there and we were able to cut over to Thompsons thru the deep hole and down towards the yellow marker. We saw many more fish on the graph in this area - we hardly marked anything east of the ferry and not many baitfish.  As we came around the yellow can, the rod sang a little song of resistance and Laker John landed a handsome 24"" fish on the same Yo Zuri. We trolled the area until 1700, marking lots of fish.  All in all the day wasn't too bad - yes it was windy but going down wind made life easier, especially with four rods and boards.  From what we saw the big mama's haven't made an appearance in the deep waters east of the ferry (IMHO). They'll show up - water was over 65 degs down there.  Stay Tuned"
