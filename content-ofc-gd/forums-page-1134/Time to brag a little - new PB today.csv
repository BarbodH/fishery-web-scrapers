122780,JohnF,2007-10-12 14:20:00,3494,"Mebbe you should get yerself one of those fighting chairs to keep him safe in the Crestliner.  Congratulations to all of you. Some folks will tell you the first born is the most powerful experience for Dad, but the only difference with the second is the doctor doesn't make you sit down cuz you look like yer gonna pass out. 32 years later I can still recall going around in a daze for hours after our first arrived. Part of it I think was fear that I wasn't nearly ready to be a Dad and part was excitement about all the great things we were gonna share. Next thing I knew they were asking for the car keys, but we had great times along the way. It all goes by too darned fast, so don't miss any of it.  Again, congratulations Pop, JF"
