633334,Roy,2011-10-23 04:46:00,13728,Welcome back. Hope things are looking up for you.
633335,ckrb2007,2011-10-23 04:48:00,449,"Welcome back........I don't want to sound like an idiot but I see 2 things wrong with your post. 1) drinking and driving a car/truck  2) driving to go to your boat to go for an evening fish.(sorry for assuming this as you could've been going to fish from shore)  I'm glad you're getting your life back together but I'm also glad you got caught. I've lost too many buddies to people that have only had ""3"" drinks.  Sorry if I sound harsh man but it kinda hits home."

633415,Roy,2011-10-23 19:22:00,13728,Yeah great. I'm sure he realizes all of this. I'm also quite sure that no one here has ever had anything bad happen in their life. Maybe we could just welcome him back. Thanks.
633423,Terry,2011-10-23 20:09:00,14456,welcome back  I will not state the obvious..... seems someone else felt the need to..LOL    
633424,HTHM,2011-10-23 20:16:00,4082,"Welcome back FinS, try not to let what was done wrong define you, but rather what was done right. I found out that nobody is perfcet a long time ago. Lets see what you've been catching!"
633425,mercman,2011-10-23 20:22:00,7054,"Welcome back.I wasn""t around when you joined, so didnt know ya back then, but i""m sure you are not the same person now, anyway. Takes guts to admit publically what you did, and that shows character.Trust me when i say this, I was in the same boat, and i'm lucky to be here. Tite lines Bud, and hope you post some fish porn for us soon. Remember, those who have never walked in your footsteps, can never fully understand.  Paul"
