They say that musky is the fish of a thousand casts, does that mean from your first day you ever fished, cause I would have surpassed that by a million! If it is from the time you started that day, then I am one lucky bugger! First cast, lifted the jig off of the bottom for the third time and bammm, fish on! He did a little dance on the water and gave me a good fight but it didn't take much time to get him into the boat, 5 minutes tops. Took a couple of pics and then a quick resuscitation in the water, and off he went. Weighted in at 13lbs, 3 oz on the Berkeley digital scale. We managed 5 walleye, and 2 smallmouths for the weekend. Had a great weekend playin cards smokin cigars and shootin the breeze at each other expense! Always seems we can have a great time no matter what mother nature throws at us!  Rob C"
