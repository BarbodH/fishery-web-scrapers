632479,mistaredone,2011-10-19 22:15:00,913,I'm heading to a cottage this weekend by Penetanguishene bay so I thought I'd get a few hours of musky fishing in.  Just wondering if the bay is safe to boat without gps maps?  also does the bay get rough?  I'll be fishing out of a 16' bass boat.  Thanks
632493,Terry,2011-10-19 22:57:00,14456,If it's the winds they are calling for you should be fine  do you have a hydrographic map of the bay
632497,davey buoy,2011-10-19 23:14:00,5505,"Make sure you stay between the buoys.There are lots of rocks and as you enter the gap, to your left is a shallow shoal going far out.Yes that ""gap"" can get very windy in a hurry especially this time of year. I grew up in that area.Some good fishing if your careful off the marked areas."

632532,mistaredone,2011-10-20 00:36:00,913,Anyone recomend a place I could pick up a hard map in the area?  Any public launch's around?
632602,bigbuck,2011-10-20 13:19:00,2449,"The public launch is at the bottom of town by The Dock Lunch. I'm not sure if the town charges anything at all. To get a map of the area, go to one of the local marinas, they will have it in stock. If you stay between the markers, you'll be fine. I'm not too sure of what's on either side though."
