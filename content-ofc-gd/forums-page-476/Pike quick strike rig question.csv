633290,Fisherman,2011-10-23 00:40:00,7201,"Okay, for those pike anglers in the know. Someone asked if a quick strike rig with 2 treble hooks is legal in Ontario. The rig he showed looks similar to a worm harness used for walleye, but 2 leaders from a snap swivel with a spinner ending with a treble on each leg.  I was under the belief that trebles on an artificial lure count as a single hook but when you add bait such as a dead sucker, then they count as 3 points each.  I looked in the book but I'm stumped."
633291,irishfield,2011-10-23 00:47:00,26272,Oh no... the old wish I had a couple beads to make it a lure thread!
633292,sauce,2011-10-23 00:49:00,219,"That is the answer. Same deal when tipping a crank bait with a worm, 2 trebles equals 6 hooks. Technically illegal in ontario."
633293,Terry,2011-10-23 00:52:00,14456,I think they changed the regs. a couple of years ago and now they are legal in Ontario
633296,irishfield,2011-10-23 00:57:00,26272,"As Terry points out it now says this in the Regs with no mention of ""except when using live bait"". They got tired of the beads being added to a quick strike rig to make it an artificial lure gig I guess. Someone find the actually gazette regs and see if the live bait being used changes each point to a hook. I think it's gone the way of the dodo bird... like the old ""9 point rule"" others use to speak around here! "
633304,Fisherman,2011-10-23 01:28:00,7201,"Ya, that's the part I can't find anymore either. Anyway it's not for me, I don't fish for them, just a fellow on another ice fishing board asking to make sure."
633305,irishfield,2011-10-23 01:31:00,26272,Remember it's a summary and not the complete regulation.. . and why I suggested finding said regs in the gazette publication or elsewhere to see what's current law.  Simple way to avoid any issues... just use a single in the yap and a treble in the back of the fish.. or two doubles.
633309,fishinguypat,2011-10-23 01:46:00,547,It's only illegal if you get caught
633310,Roy,2011-10-23 01:52:00,13728,It'll be illegal if somebody gets you caught too.
633313,GbayGiant,2011-10-23 02:04:00,1780,You can now use four treble hooks in a quick strike rig in Ontario.
633315,irishfield,2011-10-23 02:07:00,26272,Hey Bud.... how are ya tonight. We should do some Muskie hunting soon!
