633271,jeffw,2011-10-22 23:11:00,267,"shallow invaders trolled in 10 to 25 feet of water have been my top producing lure. Jakes, grandma and believer lures have also worked extremely well. Cheers Jeff"

If you are familiar with the lake, try the Goose Bay area between Ball Point and the Moorings marina and South. Look for 12-14' FOW then work South ( shallower)from there. The muskie are hanging in around the weed edges picking off the pan fish. There isn't too many boats out this time of the year so you could even fish the chanel from the lake going up toward Lindsay. Winds are calm it isn't cold or raining, enjoy your day!"
