633180,Fisherman,2011-10-22 15:42:00,7201,"Up at 5:30, bacon, eggs, toast and coffee, hook up, pick up half a scoop of minners, off to the Tiffin launch, boat in, then this voice behind me says ""nice hat"", ha, it's Skipper ""D"".  That old OFC hat is just like a beacon in the fog.  He's eastbound to the islands, I went about 300 yds in front of the beach, caught a bunch of perch with about a 1/10 keeper ratio. Even the weather was okay, light wind, no rain and the anchor held fast."
633183,GBW,2011-10-22 15:55:00,8460,"good to hear the bite is on but watch out for that ""skipper"" fellow.  he might try and pick your perch pocket..."
633207,Skipper D,2011-10-22 17:59:00,1970,"Glad you were lucky Fisherman and it was nice meeting you , we just came in our selves about ten minutes ago . All we caught were some memories  , no bite's where we were . I could 'nt even pick any pockets out there , seems every one was wearing Roys new pocket zippers....lol . Since the finder broke i'v had no luck at all , picking up one Monday night then the luck should change . Iwonder how others did out there today"
633211,Fisherman,2011-10-22 18:18:00,7201,"There were about a dozen boats around me, most were doing reasonably well from what I could see.  Couple of youngsters on one boat were having a great time going by the hooting and hollering."
633275,icefisherman,2011-10-22 23:20:00,952," Now don't tell me we were fishing next to you and we've missed each other....  we were in my Lund close to the launch with both my sons (3 and 6) and a friend fished from about Noon to maybe 4pm...there were 2 of you in your boat....both very friendly guys...and yes the kids were quite excited and noisy  Did pretty good ....but location location and location again...10 meters made all the difference...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
633278,NAW,2011-10-22 23:34:00,4022,I was on the fence about going out tomorrow morning.  But now that I read this...  Hmm. Anyone want to go perchin tomorrow morning?  Room for 2 more in the boat..
633282,davey buoy,2011-10-22 23:45:00,5505,"We were in cooks bay today,regular spots,but not much showing up on the finder.Pretty cool and windy.At the end of a slow day we know the areas to get some perch action,lots of action but smaller than usual."
633288,Fisherman,2011-10-23 00:29:00,7201,"Haha, no, not you,  I was gone by about 11. One of these fine days I'm going to hoist the OFC flag I bought a number of years ago, as long as no one promises to throw eggs."
633289,Fisherman,2011-10-23 00:31:00,7201,"Good spot, straight out from the foot bridge, 24-28 feet deep."
633295,NAW,2011-10-23 00:53:00,4022," Good..  Cuz I don't have much gas in the tank.  I always start at my favorite spot, then fan our from there.  Thanks Fisherman!"
633338,livinisfishin,2011-10-23 06:34:00,661,What time are you going nick?  * nevermind I'm a day late .
633339,Skipper D,2011-10-23 06:44:00,1970,"  It was real nice when we headed for  Cooks Bay DB , once we were there it did'nt take long for the wind to get up . We spent about an hour or so trying to get on top of them but had no luck in between the islands . With the cold and the wind and rough water we lost the mood and started the long rough ride back to the Tiffin launch . We came in and crossed the bay over to the north side and hit  spots all the way back with no luck  so we called it a day . No bites , no fishs but 22 worms left over for a next time ."
633359,GBW,2011-10-23 13:08:00,8460,"I throw eggs and then say 'sorry, I didn't know it was you' after..."
