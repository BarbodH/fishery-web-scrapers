633078,Lungelarry,2011-10-22 01:54:00,294,"I've been cleaning my perch(smaller than that one) like that for 25 years.Best way ever,fast and no waste."
633079,Roy,2011-10-22 01:55:00,13728,"I understand, Larry. My perch are a little smaller too."
633108,OutdoorDan,2011-10-22 03:45:00,325,"Mmm, winter you must come faster."
633109,Rod Caster,2011-10-22 03:49:00,5784, Agreed. I'm looking forward to my seasonal perch harvest.  I didn't know you could dismantle perch rather than filet them.
633112,OutdoorDan,2011-10-22 03:53:00,325,Yeah my uncle showed me this technique a few years ago and I was converted.
633212,northernpike56,2011-10-22 18:20:00,717,nice!!!
633260,Dozer,2011-10-22 22:05:00,896,"Roy, Swedsh chef is so much cooler than these two.  Feeshy feesh!  "
633318,hammercarp,2011-10-23 02:36:00,964,"In Europe perch (Perca fluviatilis) get much, much bigger."
633320,Roy,2011-10-23 02:43:00,13728,As do the zander and pike.
633321,irishfield,2011-10-23 02:45:00,26272,It's all the wine Roy... it allows them to digest more food !
633322,BFSC Kevin,2011-10-23 02:53:00,1351,That was way cool. Gotta try that
633337,livinisfishin,2011-10-23 06:32:00,661,If I tried that on the perch I generally catch I would probably break them in half and curse myself for just not filleting them. Sweet technique though!
633567,Miracon,2011-10-24 03:39:00,200,Reminds me of this video we found when trying to remember how Nick showed us to filet our Perch! Haha!
