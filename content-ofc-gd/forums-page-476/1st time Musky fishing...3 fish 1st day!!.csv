633436,msp,2011-10-23 21:08:00,1336,Nice job on the skiis. It really is the best stink.
632963,I'mHooked,2011-10-21 20:21:00,525,"Well, all I can say is I'M HOOKED (sorry, but it's true!). Met up with Cowanjo last Friday 6pm at the lake (Kawarthas) and we were trolling by 6:15 for a couple of hours. Nothing. After breakfast Sat. were out in the boat battling the wind and waves. Ended up finding some sheltered spots for casting some heavy plastics, ie. Bulldogs etc. Well, it ended up being a productinve day with 6 Muskie landed and 2 others lost. There was some serious battling going on, and I was a Musky virgin to boot! What a thrill!! 1st fish went to Cowanjo:   2nd, to me at 43""  What a fight!!  Another fighter,   The other fish caught are on his camera still at the cottage. We had a fish that was hooked doing the figure 8 right at boat side, with a few other follows to the boat that didn't commit. We had 1 fish take a Handlebarz spinner right at the boat. He jumped & thrashed as soon as the hook was set and sliced the braid with it's gill plate...fish gone...nice Handlebarz lure gone as well. Oh well, them's the breaks!  They were all brought in on 80# braid with 100# flouro leaders on St. Croix Legend Tournament rods.  Oh, and to answer the question from a few weeks ago about the Curado 300E vs. round baitcaster, I was casting for a total of 13-14 hours over the course of the weekend and fighting what in my mind are some pretty decent fish (for 1st time!), and have nothing but praise for the 300E! didn't tire me out & pulled the fish in quick! All fish released to be caught another day, a couple had the trebles snipped by some heavy duty bolt cutters and none the worse for wear.  I've never had so much fun being soaking wet, with the boat deck covered in hail at one point. Kidneys a little worse for wear after some of the cross lake excursions.  Hopefully have a few more pics from the other camera next week to add.  Thanks for looking. Hey Cowanjo, don't forget to bring the camera back this weekend!!"
632969,mercman,2011-10-21 20:25:00,7054,"Nice Goin !!! Its such a rush, isn't it? Congrats on you first.  Paul  "
632970,Musky or Specks,2011-10-21 20:28:00,2710,Congratulations and kiss your disposable income goodbye
632971,I'mHooked,2011-10-21 20:31:00,525,"Yes it is a rush, and what disposible income? I was going to pick up my 1st centre pin reel in the next few weeks too! Damn...Musky or Steel"
632972,Rod Caster,2011-10-21 20:35:00,5784,That's really good for your first time targetting musky... Must be a natural talent.
632973,mercman,2011-10-21 20:37:00,7054,"  Easy choice for me...........MUSKY !!!!! But depends on what you fish most.Sounds like you have the right setup for Musky, just do what i do, ask for Gift Cards from your favorite tackle shop for Christmas and Birthdays, and get the lures ya need"
632975,I'mHooked,2011-10-21 20:49:00,525," Well my buddy who'd already landed 48 Musky this season so far described Saturday as his best outing ever, so maybe I was the goodluck charm. While he was telling me how challenging it can be to find them and get them to commit, it sure seemed like we were dialed in that day! Lost 1 fish on the troll with the double 10's cowgirl. Set the hook and the line just came flying back to the boat with nothing on the end of it!"
633005,Handlebarz,2011-10-21 22:29:00,3790,Congrats on a great weekend John is one hell of a great guy to bad for the lost lure what color was it or can you say? Was it his special one he had me make here when him and Brownie were over?  If you get John to remember his camera please ask him to shoot me some pics also he will laugh.  Good luck next round.
633010,scugpg,2011-10-21 22:39:00,1373,Nice job I've been hoping to get out with John up there as well! Congrats!
633012,TerryC,2011-10-21 22:43:00,196,"Some nice looking Ski's, Congrat's.  Clarence"
633022,mike rousseau,2011-10-21 23:22:00,4661,Wow... 6 musky  Great day fellas
633031,captpierre,2011-10-21 23:40:00,2521,Great report.  Never used a Bulldog.  How do you retrieve them?  Slow along the bottom?
633037,Twocoda,2011-10-21 23:53:00,4130,ya gotta love it when the stars align to the end of your rod....nice report!!
633039,Rich Nelson,2011-10-22 00:07:00,332,"Nice fish! Pace yourself, buying musky tackle is as addictive as the hunt... Congrats on your first."
633042,Roy,2011-10-22 00:19:00,13728,Congrats to you both. A special day for sure and some fine specimens there too!
633045,Gregoire,2011-10-22 00:28:00,1397,"Thanks for the great report. It was only last year that I got hooked, prepare to get obsessed."
633056,Terry,2011-10-22 00:48:00,14456,NO you have to put them back and quit catching  have you not heard a fish of a thousand casts.....you must wait your turn  I have not got one to the boat in 2 years and it my turn...my turn.....LOL
633068,cowanjo,2011-10-22 01:11:00,249,"All i can say is karma comes with the world best teams. We worked hard in wild winds last weekend. I now have two guys first time that caught three or more musky in two days. My aussie mate said fish of 32 casts,agree with handlebaz i need to download my camera for the season! I will hopefully post next weekend - Craig is awesome fisherman that watch and alsmost out fished me ! in the end we called a draw!"
633083,mike rousseau,2011-10-22 02:31:00,4661,  Did you guys get 6 in a day? Or 6 all weekend?  Either way good job... Just curious
633117,peter23,2011-10-22 04:09:00,95,"awesome fish, what colour bulldawgs were you guys using? and how were you using them (what technique)?"
633144,Rich Clemens,2011-10-22 11:49:00,3131,"I'd say that's a day you'll never forget.   Congrats on your first and, of course, your ""hooked"" now."
633148,cowanjo,2011-10-22 12:14:00,249,six in one day ! should have been eight
633151,mike rousseau,2011-10-22 12:29:00,4661,Way to go!!!
633152,I'mHooked,2011-10-22 12:42:00,525,"It may be hard to believe, but we were actually banging our heads because we didn't land those extra 2! We were close to it being 4 each for the one day. We had some success with grey, blue & black bulldogs on a continuous jerk, stop & reel retrieve. I'll tell, it sure was a nice feeling when another boat got close to us and we asked how they were doing, they had nothing, we replied ""Oh, we've only landed 3 so far  ...we're hoping it'll pick up a little"""
633162,Miracon,2011-10-22 13:46:00,200,Wow! Thanks for the awesome detailed report! Reports like this are great reference to people going out to try for the first time! Congrats!
