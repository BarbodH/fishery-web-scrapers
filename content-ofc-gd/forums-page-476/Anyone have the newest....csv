I read the mag almost front to back a few times over, and just today, I notice an add for ice fishing jigs. I read and re-read it, then for some reason, I can't stop laughing.  Call me immature, but the broken english being translated into a north american ad in a prominent fishing magazine just makes me chuckle .   The company is custom jigs, and they have some great quotes in their add!  ""Use it my jigs for more fish to catching!""  ""Biggest action from smallest jig. Best one for the panfishes. Put small waxworm or many spikes on sharpest hook and you will catch most fishes""  ""Fastest jig on the market. Now you see it....now it catch fishes!  "
