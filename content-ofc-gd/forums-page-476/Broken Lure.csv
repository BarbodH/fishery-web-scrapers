632391,skeeter,2011-10-19 17:39:00,1907,"My favorite Pike/Bass/Walleye lure broke. Anyone know how to fix this, or where to buy more of them? The head is solid plastic with the hook inside it. The color has faded over the years, but it worked good until a big fat lakair pike decided he wanted to inflict damage, he won.          "
632410,alexmedic,2011-10-19 18:18:00,186,"what if you heated up the broken hook enough to melt/pull it out of the lure?  Then drill the holes slightly bigger (enough to put a new hook eye through), and after inserting the new hook, seal the entire hole back up with a good glue or epoxy?  I also thought of acetone to separate the 2 pieces, but it would likely melt the lure and for sure wreck any of the paint that is on it."
632411,Harrison,2011-10-19 18:22:00,2202,"Skeeter, I know alot of lures and this one falls into the "" what the heck is that"" category.  Make? Model?"
632414,skeeter,2011-10-19 18:33:00,1907,"I have had this lure so long, I don't remember when I got it. I had it when I was doing bass tournaments back in the late 80's/ early 90's. All I can tell you is that, it is a floating snake head with a single hook running thru it. You take a rubber worm/snake body ect  and hook it Texas rig and it works GREAT!!!! The entire head was painted like a snake and since the google eyes are still intact, it was good quality.  What an adrenaline rush when it gets hit. Acrobatics and tale walks from bass pike and muskie."
632415,cuzza,2011-10-19 18:38:00,467,"I don't like your chnaces of fixing it unless you can split it along the seam in the middle and then epoxy it back together with a new hook. but even if you can, I doubt it'll be the same."
632425,mercman,2011-10-19 18:59:00,7054,"I would carefully cut it with a band saw, down the length of the hook, using the hook as a guide.Remove the broken hook, and epoxi both halves back together."
632430,Roy,2011-10-19 19:04:00,13728,"Dann, PM me the dimensions, weight, size hook etc."
632432,Lip-ripper,2011-10-19 19:13:00,228," I think it's called a ""Snakebait"" made by a lure company called Burke. I had one when I was younger. I took a quick peek on eBay but there aren't any there."

632721,zamboniwaterboy,2011-10-20 21:51:00,126,"How about making an exact copy or 12 of this same lure?  On youtube type in ""larry dahlberg lure making"", he has awesome videos.  "

632898,skeeter,2011-10-21 17:17:00,1907,Lot's of great idea's here guy's ! Thanks.
632904,Remastered,2011-10-21 18:00:00,143,It looks like it's made out of elephant tusk. What does it look like when fishing it?
632922,Hooked,2011-10-21 18:33:00,891,"I remember those lures when I was a kid, use to see them in the Cabela's magazines.  Always wanted one!  Do you think you can use epoxy to seal the seem?  Or cover the head in epoxy?"
632927,Dabluz,2011-10-21 18:40:00,701,"  Not much info on the lure itself (ex.: cost, weight, length).....just photos of big fish.  I'm leery of advertisements that only show big fish but very little about their product."
632934,ckrb2007,2011-10-21 18:59:00,449,"I have the exact lure in my box, but mine is black with dark grey scales....... the hook is pretty darn rusty though. Still works great with a 8"" plastic on it!"
632988,skeeter,2011-10-21 21:29:00,1907,If it comes apart without breaking into pieces it should epoxy back together. But I'm going to try to make a mold of it first just in case.  The snake lures now are totally different.
633106,Hooked,2011-10-22 03:44:00,891," Check youtube, seen guys on there make there own molds.  they break it down for ya too."
