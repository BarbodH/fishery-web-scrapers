He took his friend out for a drive, and he chose the route carefully in order to impress on him the possibilities of the brokerage business. ""Look at that yacht,"" he said as they drove slowly past a marina. ""That belongs to the senior partner at Merrill Lynch. The head of Goldman, Sachs, owns that one over there. And look at that huge yacht out there. That's the pride and joy of the top seller at Prudential-Bache."" His friend was silent. Goodman turned to look at him and saw a pained look on his face. ""What's the matter?"" Goodman asked. ""I was just wondering,"" his friend said, ""why there aren't there any customers' yachts?"""
