632864,manitoubass2,2011-10-21 15:06:00,11391," I used to live/work up there. It's tough to even get to the speed limit on that highway before your slowing down for a moose, lol   "

632947,bigbuck,2011-10-21 19:53:00,2449,"Jeez, now I'm really thinking about doing my PAL/Hunter's safety course now. I'm hoping to go for Moose or Elk next year if I can get the courses out of the way and get halfway comfortable with my rifle again (I haven't done any real shooting in over 10 years, I used to shoot sub MOA at 200 yds with my .300WinMag). Nice Moose, pike and walleye. Isn't the far north nice???"
