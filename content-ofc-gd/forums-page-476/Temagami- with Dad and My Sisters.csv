631495,Jen,2011-10-17 00:31:00,833,"I haven't posted in a while, life has kept me rather busy and away from fishing I am afraid, however this trip could not be missed.  What follows is a weekend to remember!  My father, brother and a friend always made a weekend trip to Temagami for a fall fish... Since Sonny's been gone, my dad and his buddy have been going! This year dads buddy couldn't make it... so dad decided to take his daughters instead.  Our Arrival ( Dad said, pack warm, it will be very cold, probably rain the whole time we are there!) 16 - 20 degree sunny weather the whole weekend!  Needless to say we overpacked!  15 minute boat ride from the launch to the island      Unpacked and got right out fishing!  Dad also said we shouldn't really expect to catch many fish ( they never really do well during the fall )... first night, a nice pike, a couple of bass and this great little guy, who I actually felt hit on my new carrot rod! Go figure!        We all love to sleep in so never got out for an early morning fish... Which is why I don't think we ever managed to catch a walleye. However, we did catch more bass, white fish, and lake trout.        It was an amazing weekend, seeing where our dad and brother would run away to several times a year and actually managing to outfish them once we finally got to go!  I guess the black and silver rapala J-11 wasn't the only lure to use up there...eh dad? lol  The weather managed to hold off until we had the boat loaded and we were heading home...      The whole trip home it poured rain and we talked about what a wonderful time we had and how lucky we were to not only have been blessed with good weather but the opportunity to spend time together. I should edit this a bit just to add the whitefish we caught trolling on mepps spinners, the lake trout jigging huge spoons while drifting over 80 to 150 ft drop offs and the bass on crappie rigs.  Unconventional fishing to say the least!  "

632565,Jen,2011-10-20 04:25:00,833," Not so corny Roy, I am sure he must have had a hand in the catching part... lake trout in the fall Jigging pfft... and white fish on spinners?? He was laughing his short little A** off the entire time from his little tiny fishing boat in the clouds!  It's great to be back on the water enjoying the moments that I love again!"
