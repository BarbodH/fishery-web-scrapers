632913,fishnsled,2011-10-21 18:19:00,3520,I'd say Fallfish as well. Scroll down to see the image.  image
632919,Dabluz,2011-10-21 18:30:00,701,"Yep....fallfish it is.  Here in Quebec, they are called ""ouitouche"".  Pike love to eat them.  They are also great as cut bait too.  The flesh has a pretty strong odour.  They are a very rapid fish and often jump out of the water when caught on a small hook and very light line.  I have caught them up to 14 inches long."
