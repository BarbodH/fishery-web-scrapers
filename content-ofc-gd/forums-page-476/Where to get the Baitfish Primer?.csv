633153,J-M,2011-10-22 12:47:00,65,"  Hey Crossover,  If you're looking for some additional sources for minnow identification, I found the following website has a pretty extensive list of minnows and ID features with real pictures:  http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Home/species_a_to_z/AZFish/tabid/17913/Default.aspx  Also, a great book for Fish ID, cost's less than $30 is the ""Rom Field Guide to Fish ID"" http://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Freshwater-Fishes-Ontario/dp/0888544596/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319287577&sr=8-1  Cheers"
633214,crossover,2011-10-22 18:24:00,172, Thanks Roy   The ROM book is a great book. I ordered all 4 a few days ago.
633231,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-22 19:45:00,0,"any DFO office will have the baitfish primer.  another valuable resource is the scott crossman ""bible"". if you every have any ID questions i consider myself somewhat of an amateur ichthyologist and have successfully id'd all sorts of Ontario fish from minnows, juvenile salmonids, and larval fish."
