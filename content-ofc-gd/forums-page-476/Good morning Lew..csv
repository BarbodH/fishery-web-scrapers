632786,Roy,2011-10-21 06:40:00,13728,You guys have a safe and fun trip. LSC will be OFC celebrity waters this weekend. Looking forward to reading the fishing tales.
632787,lew,2011-10-21 06:50:00,12766,G'Day Roy & thanks.  Water conditions aren't sounding too good but we'll make the best of it & hopefully have a few fish'n tales to tell.  I'm outta here in about 40 minutes
632792,Skipper D,2011-10-21 09:41:00,1970,"Good morning Mr. R & good morning Lew , have a good one today boys ."
632794,Handlebarz,2011-10-21 10:00:00,3790,This are Sheet with a capital S the creeks are very high and the Thames was at least 2' high yesterday and then last night I heard that they opened the dam in London so that will not help us fishing the lake at all as that water will be pushing more mud out then politicians in Ottawa!  Either way we will be on the west end of the lake trying for some big girls hope Lew and Pete are having a safe ride right now and the others a safe one tonight. See ya all in the am.
632795,Cast-Away,2011-10-21 10:06:00,790,"Man, you many times have I seen posts in the past titled ""good morning Lew""!"
632800,Big Cliff,2011-10-21 10:57:00,6899,"Well, I know you guys will have a wonderful time regardless of how the fishing is! Enjoy!"
632801,motv8tr,2011-10-21 11:18:00,2587,"Good morning all, have fun and be safe....looking forward to the reports.  Maureen"
632802,scugpg,2011-10-21 11:19:00,1373," The one Dam that used to be let out in the fall hasn't been functional for several years now. Upstream reservoirs are over 3' higher right now and letting water out as is the river level in the city, so not looking good for the Thames downstream for at least a couple days its complete chocolate milk up this way.  I wanted to get down there this weekend but going to hold off now. Good luck to those that do."
632805,Rizzo,2011-10-21 11:56:00,4754,"have a buddy who has a charter booked on LSC tomorrow, sounds like the guide might be calling it off due to conditions being poor. Either way, I'm sure these guys will find a way to enjoy themselves"
632809,mike rousseau,2011-10-21 12:04:00,4661,Fish need to eat either way... Dirty or clear... Just means you have to figure out a bit different pattern...  These are the challenges of musky fishing...  I'm sure the OFC boys will help each other a bit with the pattern and figure something good out by the end of the 3 days...
632943,bigbuck,2011-10-21 19:30:00,2449,Enjoy down there Lew!! I hope you nail a couple of nice fatties.
632965,Roy,2011-10-21 20:24:00,13728, Hand it over then. I have a great pic of Lew smiling. It was taken on my birthday at Beans and Maribeth's house 8-9 years ago.
632974,Roy,2011-10-21 20:46:00,13728,"Sure, as soon as I have the time to find it."
632976,misfish,2011-10-21 20:50:00,29133,I seen Lew smile this summer in person aswell.
632999,Remastered,2011-10-21 21:45:00,143," I don't mean to be rude, but 8-9 years ago sounds really ancient."
633002,Roy,2011-10-21 22:05:00,13728,"Yeah well....my kids are in their 40's, I have 11 grandchildren...Great grandfather soon. Hell yeah, I'm at death's door....I'm just waiting for my ride.  Life in the old days wasn't as bad as they all make it out to be. Our history books only had one chapter...school was a cakewalk."
633004,Handlebarz,2011-10-21 22:22:00,3790, I nominate this for best reply of the year but I am tired as hell so what do I know???
633107,Remastered,2011-10-22 03:44:00,143, lol  I didn't mean that. I meant ancient for a smile
