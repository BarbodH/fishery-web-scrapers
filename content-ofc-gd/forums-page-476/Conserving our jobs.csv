633147,Gregoire,2011-10-22 12:02:00,1397,"This topic can open a debate as to what companies you support. One poster said boycott walmart, but the average walmart has mroe locally sourced products than many of the other big box stores. Should you buy things from Canadian Tire that are made in China, or should you buy locally sourced products from walmart, even though the have questionable labour management practices? Whenever possible I try to buy groceries from a farmers market, and I go to walmart to buy other consumer goods because I feel as though I am more likely to find products that are made in Ontario or at least Canada."
633167,smally21,2011-10-22 14:22:00,993,"i was with you until the walmart part. lots of other places to buy light bulbs than walmart.  if you want to rant about buying canadian and protecting canadian jobs you can't in good conscience shop at walmart. buy your light bulbs at canadian tire there is a chance some of your money will stay in canada.  the chain sells almost all offshore goods, invented bully economics, whose single purpose is to destroy small stores and small producers, take them over or eliminate them.there is no better way to funnel your money straight out of the country than to shop at walmart."
633217,Dave Bailey,2011-10-22 18:39:00,1641," Pay people crap wages and they won't be able to afford to buy anything, and the economy tanks. Are those $4 an hour Mexicans the driving force behind their booming economy where brand new cars and large homes are the norm? Oh, I forgot, most Mexicans are living in poverty.  If we lose many more jobs to China Canadians won't be able to afford to buy the cheap goods produced over there. Then things will gradually switch and we'll become the cheap labour providers and they will be the rich consumers."
633220,Gregoire,2011-10-22 18:59:00,1397," How can you argue that the money will stay in canada if the products you are buying are made in China. While the profits are going to Canadians mostly, all the manufacturing jobs are going overseas. Walmart has many faults as a corporation, but one of this things that it does well is source locally produced merchandise. Unfortunately in our economy it seems like we need to choose between the lesser of two evils. In my case I would rather buy a locally sourced product from a foreign retailer than a product sourced overseas from a Canadian retailer."

633251,Rod Caster,2011-10-22 20:38:00,5784,"From Wikipedia: Canada's beer production has been mainly under the control of foreign multinationals. By the end of 2006, nearly 90% of beer sales was of product brewed domestically under license from non-domestic corporations. American beers brewed under license dominate much of the market. For example Budweiser is brewed under license in Canada by Labatt's and Coors Light by Molson.The market in Canada for domestic beer is dominated by Labatt, Molson and Sleeman, all foreign-owned companies. The largest Canadian-owned brewer, Moosehead Brewery, controls about 5.5% of the Canadian market.  -Moosehead beer is $39.50 for 24 bottles. -Fully Canadian -Creemore is $42.95 for 24 bottles. - owned by Molson which merged with Coors. -Steamwhistle is $43.95 for 24 bottles. -Keiths is $39.95 for 24 bottles.- owned by Labatt which is owned by Anheuser-Bush. -Muskoka premium lager is $43.95 for 24 bottles. -upper canada is $29.95 for 24 bottles. - Owned by Sleeman, which is owned by Molson  Canadian beer is EXPENSIVE! I usually spend 27-32 per case.  Moosehead is our largest fully Canadian brewing company... so I guess I'll have to learn to enjoy it and drink it modestly. haha  Thanks for the reminder Bigugli. I wish it were easier to buy Canadian."
633252,Grimace,2011-10-22 20:53:00,2020,I am pretty sure Sleeman sold to Sapporro.  Unless Molson owns them as well.
633256,Rod Caster,2011-10-22 21:26:00,5784,  Your right... so Upper Canada is also owned by Sapporra not Molson.

Yes the canned fruit even with Dole or DelMonte labels is from China, we no longer buy it.  And not only that but Bicks Pickles is about to close in Dunnville, Bicks will now be made offshore. Speaking of that, have you noticed that a lot of pickles come from India now? I won't buy those either.  Check this out puddicombs Winona They have began to sell their version of Perry which is a pear cider from Wales. I bought a 6 pack of it a few weeks ago. First sip was hmmm, second was this is different, third sip and the bottle was gone. Pretty dam good stuff. The reason why they have developed their own? To use up the pears that are no longer going to the fruit canners because they all are buying their fruit in China and Puddicombe wanted to do something with the fruit.  Two thumbs up to them for trying when big business turned their backs on them.  Let me recount a conversation I heard when visiting an aunt in Florida many years ago when her neighbour paid a visit. He said, ""I wanted to buy an American made car, won't buy foreign, so I buy a new Plymouth. Turns out the rotten thing is made in Canada! Am I ever P'd off!""  I still chuckle at that even years later.  Buy homemade as often as you can. Funny thing BigUgly, I started a thread about this a few years ago and got slammed for encouraging people to buy products from our own shores because I ""Couldn't see the bigger picture of open trading."" I hope that this thread will endure as you intended."

633511,bigugli,2011-10-24 01:11:00,6138,Honda originally had it's sights set on building the Alliston plant in the Sault. It was close to the US border. It had direct shipping access at the Seaway. There was a steel mill desperate for contracts to produce steel for Honda. The city fathers weren't willing to do a deal to attract Honda and the Sault lost out.

With that thought in mind, read the following, obviously Written by a good Canadian:  Shopping in Lowe's the other day for some reason and just for the fun of it  I was looking at the hose attachments .They were all made in China . The next day I was in Home Hardware  and just for the fun of it I checked the hose attachmentsThere. They were made in Canada! Start looking........ In our current economic situation, every little thing we Buy or do affects someone else - even their job.  A quote from a consumer:...my grandson likes Hershey's candy. I noticed, though, that it is marked made in Mexico now. I do not buy it any more. My favourite toothpaste, Colgate, is made in Mexico now. I have switched to Crest.  You have to read the labels on everything.  This past weekend I was at Wal-Mart. I needed 60W Light bulbs. I was in the light bulb aisle, and right next To the GE brand I normally buy was an off-brand labelled, ""Everyday Value"".  I picked up both types of bulbs and Compared the stats - they were the same except for the Price. The GE bulbs were more money than the Everyday Value brand but the thing that surprised me the most Was the fact that GE was made in MEXICO and the Everyday Value brand was made in - get ready for this - Canada at a company in Ontario . Their Equate Products are also made in Canada , and are very good.  Just to add my own experience on buying Made In Canada , I was looking for canned mushrooms that were made in Canada and could never find any, so I would buy fresh. But a miracle happened, when in our Foodland store I found Ravine mushrooms - made in Canada with a Little red maple leaf on can.  A little more money but When I opened the can I looked at mushrooms that look Like real mushrooms, not a mushroom that looks like It was cleaned in bleach. Another product I no longer buy is Del Monte or Dole cannedFruit. Del Monte is packaged in Taiwan and Dole is now a product of China.Why should we pay for their fruit when our growers are left withFruit rotting on the trees. E.D. Smith is still made in Canada buy their's, at least you will know what is in it and have some quality control.So throw out the myth that you can not find products you Use every day that are made right here .  My challenge To you is to start reading the labels when you shop for Everyday things and see what you can find that is made In Canada . The job you save may be your own or your Neighbour's'!(Your children & grandchildren, also)  Start buying Canadian, one Light bulb at a time! Stop buying from overseas companies! (We should have awakened two decades ago.) Let's get with the program. Help our fellow Canadians Keep their jobs and create more jobs here in Canada.  If President Obama insists on a 'Made in America ' Policy, which is commendable of him, to support American workers, we should do likewise. BUY CANADIAN!  Read the labels. Support Canadian jobs."

At the same time, we have jobbers/pretend farmers, selling cheap produce from all around the globe, claiming it's Canadian. Yes it is cheaper. No it is not fresh. It was picked unripened and shipped thousands of miles over the space of a week. Some produce will be gassed to colour and ripen fruit surfaces. There is little flavour or nutrient value in such produce. Most of these 3rd world producers are still using pesticides which we banned decades back. Nasty chemicals like DDT, Temek, Chlordane, Mirex, etc...., are still being used regularly on crops grown in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia. Sometimes the price you pay is not in dollars and cents."
