Fact is all of them have it. none of them are clean as a whistle."
633365,Tybo,2011-10-23 13:56:00,1373,Cadillac is not a innovators. Caddie is the leader and has been for quite some time. Most car companies only safety test around 30mph.Caddie shots cars off over passes. Here's a few. Power and rack in pinion steering. disc & power brakes. air bags. fuel injection. roll support. A/c And the electronic system that is used on every car with gas engine. And the list goes on. Basicly every thing on a new car came from BMW and Cadillac.
633382,Billy Bob,2011-10-23 15:05:00,5865," Electronic ignition was first developed and introduced by Mopar in 1973...  I would also like to see some references on those other claims...  BTW how many vehicles/people do you know get shot off of over passes.....  ...maybe that's why other car manufacture don't waste their time and resources doing this...but rather concentrate on head end, rear end and T-Bone crashes..."
633389,John Bacon,2011-10-23 15:55:00,3277," Isn't BMW German? Wasn't Volkswagon the first to use fuel injection? I believe ABS brakes were also introduced by German companies.  Regardless of who invented most of the modern features on new automobiles, the Japanese companies to seem to be way ahead of the north american companies when it comes to assembling them into a vehicle that doesn't contantly need to be repaired. That is probably why Toyota is now selling more vehicles than GM."
633398,Tybo,2011-10-23 17:09:00,1373,"Common rail and fuel injection are two different thing.If I remember correctly,Rolls Royce and Allison invent fuel injection. Caddie made it work in cars. ABS was invented by BMW first for their bikes,Then put into the cars about the same time caddie started. Power and disc brakes were caddie. Yes mopar did.But 99% of gas burning car use a ecm now.  Toyota basically  sell cars in every country on the planet. To dictatorship countries  that suppress and murder  their own people."
633435,Billy Bob,2011-10-23 21:06:00,5865," So these dictatorship countries that ""suppress"" and murder their own people still have enough money to purchase Toyota vehicles....  BTW...Toyota, Honda, etc are not selling a lot of cars because GM has done such a wonderful job building their vehicles but rather because of the terrible job they have done with reliability and customer service...or should I say lack of customer service....think government bail out....errrr tax payer bail out....that's you and me...  I am still interested in seeing those references on those other Caddie claims."
633483,Bernie,2011-10-23 23:40:00,3190," OK, here's one for you. Electronic ignition came out on a Johnson outboard in 1967 on a 55HP. Worked pretty good too. The first ones had some box troubles but the replacement ones were OK."

Here are some facts:  For Weight reduction: ================================================================================== - Lighter & stronger materials: Dual-phase HSLA materials (expensive) weights nearly the same but cabaple of taking much more impact energy when in collision (there are other crazier ones) have been widely used on vehicles nowadays  - Alternative materials to replace metals Instead of having a metal bumper acting as an energy absorber, 2012 Honda (cannot reveal model name) vehicle uses Special Styroform to reduce the weight by 80%  - Laser Welding Implementation Traditional MIG welding (a method to 'glue' metals together) adds roughly 5% of the toal car weight whereas Laser Welding, which requires a lot more stuff) adds ZERO weight to the car. Ex: 2011 Chevy (cannot reveal the model) Radiator Support assembly weights only 80% of its previous models.   However, weight additions due to ================================================================================================= - Technology gages/toys On average, your instrumental panel weights almost 40% heavier than it was because of electronics such as GPS, Airbag, stereo, Bluetooth, Back-up camera/sensor system ... & eletrical wiring harnesses coming with them.  Much Higher Safety Standards ========================================== High standards means more components (weight) added to the car   All in all, if there were no technological advances in materials & in other countless fields, 2000 Civic would have to be at least 2x heavier than a 2011 model in order to do what a 2011 does!"

Not sure I'm willing to wait ten years to post on this thread, nor do I have fast forwarding abiilities. Most two year old cars don't have over 100 000 problem free kms, I thought that was good input to show that some vehicles are still reliable and also have better technology. Plus I think corollas are generally considered winners when it comes to being good cars...just like the civics.

My mechanic has done full engine swaps on tdi's with only 150k because of this. I'm hearing the new models really fell off with interior quality as well, but they did also lower the price on them. Something has to give I guess. I am worried about which car will replace my 98 tdi when it dies one day (330 000km and running strong).  Those driving BMW's and Mercedes are not in the clear either. Herd of a guy replacing 5 fuel pumps on the new BMW 335 when it only had 30k on it. Not to impressive for a 80k car.

A good proportion of the lineups from the North American manufacturers have been switchjed to use European models that have been softened up e.g. the Ford Fiesta has been around forever in Europe"

No matter how I adjusted the seat and the steering wheel. You had to stop 75m from a light in order to see it. This stupid idea of slanting the angle of the bottom of the side window frame. Try and parallel park and it will drive you batty. You always end up crooked because it screws up your perspective. I drove the Chev Impala as well and it was almost as bad. No view at all in the rear view mirror because of the gigantic ass end sticking up in the air. You step on the gas and all it does is make noise and does not accelerate until the pedal is 3/4s of the way to the floor. These guys forgot how to build cars.

Pretty much everyone expects air conditioning as a standard feature today, and that was not the case with a 2000 Honda Civic (it was a $1,300 option). We all expect bells and whistles like power windows and locks, remote keyless entry, a nice stereo, etc etc etc. We all want the new safety features, like multiple air bags and I-beams in the doors and ABS brakes and all kinds of other stuff that helps keep us alive in a collision - none of that stuff was found in the 2000 Honda Civic. I know because my ex drove one.  End result - I would bet the 2011 Chevy probably weighs a bit more than the 2000 Honda, which is why even with more engine power, it's still delivering about the same fuel economy.  Oh - and let's not forget, here we are 11 years later and in spite of continually rising costs, the retail price of a car hasn't changed all that much. In 2000 a decent economy car cost about $20k, and it still does today - in spite of having all that extra stuff in it.

Fifteen years ago, my uncle in europe had an Opel corsa diesel that was similar to a Honda Civic.  THis thing would average 3-4 litres per 100/km and he still has this car today.  That is fuel efficient.  I went to Austria four years ago and rented a van for seven people and lots of luggage.  When I got there they had a brand new Opel Vivaro that had nine seats and loads of luggage room.  It looked like a box, but heck, it drove like a sedan.  It had a turbo diesel engine and had plenty of guts.  I put 3500 km on the thing over three weeks and filled it up three times.  Our last day before the vehicle return I was fooling around with the guages and stumbled upon the trip computer.  Over the three weeks I burned an average of 8.8 litres per 100 km and this is autobahn driving upto 180 km/h, mountain driving, city driving, basically everything.  I was amazed.  This thing is bigger than the Chevy Express/GMC Savana and burns less than half the fuel!  Where can I get one in Canada?  The answer is: I can't.  And probably never will, because we are forced to believe that fuel efficient vehicles are years away.  That is Bull!.
