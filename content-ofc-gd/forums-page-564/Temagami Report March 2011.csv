561767,TJQ,2011-03-14 20:42:00,7806,Wow.. just got a chance to go through this.. awesome report.. man our roads can be bitchy sometimes.
561773,Roy,2011-03-14 20:50:00,13728, Ditchy also.
561782,solopaddler,2011-03-14 21:24:00,8605,Slow fishing or not it's such a beautiful place to spend a week.  Sounds like a whole lotta fun.
561121,Joey,2011-03-12 18:39:00,9122,"Paul and I were invited to join Lloyd, Terry and Lloyd's brother, Ralph, in a cabin on Lake Temagami for a week in March and had been waiting since January for March 5th to finally arrive.  We had all our gear packed and were on the road by 9:30 a.m. on that Saturday morning, in a pretty good snowfall.  Not my favorite driving conditions, not to mention we had heard highway 11 from North Bay to Temagami was closed due to a serious accident the day before.  We took our time and kept in contact with Terry all the way up.  He ended up being stopped by road closures all the way up, but we managed to sail right through on the tails of a competent semi who obviously knew that road well.    Despite the bad road conditions, the scenery was a winter wonderland.      5 1/2 hours later, we arrive and unpacked and checked out our home for the week.  It was a lovely cabin with satellite TV, running water and a fireplace.  Our room was huge and even had its own sink for teeth brushing and face washing.        We all settled in and watched a bit of TV in anticipation of the week to come of fishing and snowmobiling and great food and company.          We had a good night's sleep and headed out early Sunday morning with visions of sugarfish dancing in our heads  All set up and ready on a beautiful, sunny day, with a temp of -21, with wind gusts making it feel like -31, brrrrrrrr!!!!        But it was nice and toasty in my little hut.      And there was plenty of ice, at least 25 inches or more.      We had our walkie talkies to keep in touch and razz each other.  Paul called out on his walkie talkie that he had a pretty good sized pickerel, so I ran over with the camera and measuring tape.  26 inches.  Over slot    That's the only fish pic I took of the day, but here are the stats for Sunday:  Paul - 1 pickerel Lloyd - 1 laker Terry - 2 lakers, 1 whitefish Ralph - 1 laker, 1 whitefish Joey - skunked  Back to camp and had a great supper and early night and were up and at it again early Monday morning.  It was cold and sunny with wind again and fishing was not so good Monday.  Monday's Stats:  Paul - 0 Joey - 0 Ralph - 0 Lloyd - 1 laker Terry - 1 laker  Tuesday we decided to go to Kokoko Lake, which was a good distance so we left even earlier in the morning than the two days previous.  It was cold and sunny again and we made our destination in about 45 minutes.  Had a nice drive through the bushes too which is always neat on a sled.  Kokoko is a beautiful landlocked lake with no road access.        Paul found the fish that day and after several hours on the lake, we decided to head over to join some OFC'rs who were staying at Loon Lake Lodge to see how they were making out, and even managed to fish there for a bit.  Tuesday's Stats:  Lloyd - 7 lakers Terry - 3 lakers, 2 whitefish, 2 herring Paul - 3 lakers Joey - 1 laker Ralph - skunked  We headed back and sundown and had another great meal!  Put on over 100 miles that day    We saw promise at the area near Loon Lake Lodge the day before so decided to head there first thing Wednesday morning.  Temps that morning were -9 so it was a bit warmer.  I got a nice little laker right off the bat!    At one point a bunch of huge fish decided they didn't like the bottom of the lake any more and shot up for some reason.  They were definately not interested in my lure.  We figure they might have been ling!      We decided to leave that area and head to Lloyd rock for awhile, and made it just ahead of a huge snowstorm that turned into freezing rain later on.    States for Wednesday:  Joey - 1 laker Paul - 1 herring Ralph - 0 Lloyd - 1 laker, 1 whitefish Terry - hemmeroids  Back at camp Lloyd cooked us up another feast.  We also got a good laugh when he tried to throw his sock up to his loft and missed    The Chef at work:    The rule was, if you got skunked, you had to do the dishes    We decided that night that we liked Kokoko so much we were going to head back there Thursday morning.  It was +2 with wet snow all day, and we went and had a great time.  Terry even hooked up his helmet cam and got some good footage of the trip through the woods. footage is a bit wet tho.  I caugth my first herring ever    Snowed allllllll day!    and alllllllll night!    Thursdays stats:  Joey - 3 herring Paul - 1 whitefish Terry - 3 lakers, 1 herring Lloyd - 5 lakes  We had a little tourney that day, 2 bux apiece for whoever caugth the most fish, so Lloyd took that win. It was back and forth between Terry and him all day, but he clinched it in the end with one more fish  With Lloyd feeling so rich with his $10 win, we headed to town for supper that night.  We got up Friday morning and it was another storm, with the forecast calling for heavy winds both Friday and Saturday.  With some situations arising with flooding in some of the guys' homes and the weather forecast, we decided to head home a day early, much to everyone's disappointment.  We knew the drive would be bad, but right off the get go this was what we ran into      It was not a good drive back at all!!    I was so happy to get to North Bay we stopped for a Timmies and I got a shot of the Dionne Quintuplets' home.    After North Bay, it turned to freezing rain, and still more accidents.     But we made it safe and sound   It was a really awesome week of fishing, good food and especially great company.  Was a pleasure to meet Ralph and a pleasure as always Lloyd and Terry.  When are we going again  Joey & Paul"
561124,Grimace,2011-03-12 18:51:00,2020,Awesome report.  What a beautiful cottage.  Those quintuplets had a pretty rough go.  Pretty shameful stuff.   I have still not fished Temagami.  It is on the list.
561136,Rod Caster,2011-03-12 19:12:00,5784,Nice full report! That's quite a few fish over those days. Well done.  I like the night time snow fall pic.
561142,Live2fish85,2011-03-12 19:27:00,1633,"Sounds like you had a blast. Nice fish in the pictures. I love when the weather is like that with trees covered in snow it's gorgeous, not the nicest for driving but wonderful part of living where we do."
561145,SlowPoke,2011-03-12 19:44:00,2984,"I've been driving a truck for a looong time and I still don't understand why they like to park like that in the winter. Thanks for sharing the report; looks like good numbers, good food, good company and a really nice cabin!"
561148,Roy,2011-03-12 19:55:00,13728,"I'm so glad you all had a good time and all got home safely! Another beauty report Joey. Love your pics too!  I was wondering though, were Terry' s hemorrhoids in the slot?  Thanks for taking the time to document your great trip for us shut-ins. You're wonderful!"
561149,bucktail,2011-03-12 19:59:00,1857,That looks like a great trip minus the drive!!  
561153,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-12 20:06:00,0,Jumpin....Terry caught lots of fish...     
561157,Billy Bob,2011-03-12 20:17:00,5865,That was a fun report to read....  Bob
561164,fishnsled,2011-03-12 20:35:00,3520,WOW!! Paul not only caught a fish but a very nice fish!!!  Looks like everyone had a great time. Great to know that everyone made it up there and back without any problems. That drive looks like it was just nasty. Thanks for the report Joey.
561165,Terry,2011-03-12 20:41:00,14456,"great report, it's almost like being there  oh I was there..LOL  I had a great time  the drive both ways could have been better...much better but we all made it there and back, so..  here are a few pictures and short video    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=wh.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/wh.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=trout.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/trout.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=trout1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/trout1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4161.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4161.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4162.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4162.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF4163.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF4163.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf""'>http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2Fkjhghjogbph.mp4"">  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2Fooo.mp4"">"
561180,lew,2011-03-12 22:00:00,12766,"Welcome home & thanks for the fish'n tale Joey, sounds like a great vacation for everybody. Nasty roads though, good to hear everyone made it home safely."
561185,ehg,2011-03-12 22:40:00,2666,Great report  The driving and snowmobiling looks scary though.
561194,Rich Clemens,2011-03-12 23:08:00,3131,Great report Joey.   Would be nice to take a treck up north.   We'd always wonder what some of the places we have been - look like in winter.
561208,vinnimon,2011-03-12 23:27:00,2593,great report and glad you all made in back home safely.
561234,Ron,2011-03-13 00:23:00,1683,Glad to see everyone made it make safe and sound.
561247,Leecher,2011-03-13 01:17:00,7832,"Great report and pics Joey Sounds like you guys were in for some nasty weather up there     Glad you all had a good time, got into some fishes and got back home safely Thanks for sharing Leechman"
561257,Joeytier,2011-03-13 01:49:00,3990,Great report.  Still never made it up there in the winter.  Next year..
561459,fishhunter,2011-03-13 22:06:00,604,Great post. Was nice to enjoy the week with you all. Its to bad the lack of fish and weather killed us. Well can start planning for next years trip.
561484,corvette1,2011-03-13 23:33:00,1765,great report joey looks like every one had a good time
561514,Bernie,2011-03-14 01:02:00,3190,"Looks like you guys had fun, and caught a few fish too. Good stuff.  I like the deal if you get skunked you have to do the dishes....Hmmm, on second thought....never mind.   I drove truck up and down that highway for several years. There were more lumber trucks going back then, but there were not as many guys hitting the bush as there is now. Back then you didn't go to driving schools, you learned from pros first."
561527,NAW,2011-03-14 01:19:00,4022,That was a good read.  Thank Joey.  Glad to see you got that 565 all figured out!
561532,Moosebunk,2011-03-14 01:32:00,3970,Enjoyed that Jo. & Co.  Fine pics and write up.  Thanks.  Nice to see Terry nab a few too.
561537,Fish Farmer,2011-03-14 01:43:00,2234,"Great report, thanks for sharing. looks like you guys had a great week."
561544,Joey,2011-03-14 02:06:00,9122,Thanks all for the great comments.  Unfortunately its back to reality and work tomorrow  But the good times we shared last week will linger for awhile
