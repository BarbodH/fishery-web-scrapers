212547,mikeh,2008-06-08 14:47:00,824,"welcome to the board . Have you picked up the fishing regulations book yet? there is info in there that may give you tips on where to start. If you are a carp fisherman you can try where the Rouge River meets lake ontario, also try going into some local fishing stores (Tightlines in Pickering) and ask them where to start. good luck."
212717,gone_fishin,2008-06-08 21:07:00,481,"in Ajax there isn't a whole lot... the closest spot would be Duffin's Creek. near the mouth, in the marsh area (back bays), you can get lots of carp and catfish, i have caught a couple bass and pike there as well. up the river in the spring you can get rainbow trout, and in the fall you can get salmon.  the closest lake (aside from Lake Ontario) is Lake Scugog near Port Perry. you can get panfish (crappies, perch, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rockbass), bass, walleye, muskie, carp, catfish.  PM me if you want to meet up sometime... we're living in the same town!"

308018,blakewalk,2009-02-19 00:33:00,86,Hello there & welcome!  From whereabouts did you come?  I recommend the short trip to scugog; & maybe go out and buy the Backroad Mapbook for your region- they have tonnes of info on good access points!  Definately download the regulations (.pdf) for your zone off the MNR website: Zone 16 Regs  Take Care!

308340,ketchenany,2009-02-19 21:31:00,3229,"Welcome to the board. I have a publication/map (looks like a folded map) that was done by Durham Tourism (1998). It has all of the spots and types of fish species with illustrations and type of food they like, lures to use and peak season etc. very comprehensive little guide. I've had it for years because of my tourism connections.  I'm not sure if they still have them but it's worth a try,  If you want to contact them here is the info  Tourisn Durham PO Box 623 Whitby ON L1N 6A3 Tel 905 723.0023 or 1800.413.0017"

561762,Live2fish85,2011-03-14 20:29:00,1633,Rice Lake isn't to far maybe and hour to Bewdley and you can rent boats there for cheap and there is great Bass fishing there and Walleye is also great there.
561901,msp,2011-03-15 01:22:00,1336,Before listening to this guy please check the regulations as to where you can and cannot fish.
561924,ehg,2011-03-15 02:38:00,2666,"This post was a one shot deal by someone in the UK three yrs. ago. Can't believe there is 4,500 plus page views on it."
562014,FishTracker,2011-03-15 15:29:00,47,It really depends on what you are looking to fish for.  There are lots of places in the Durham area...I would suggest Scugog if you want to get into some Bass...
