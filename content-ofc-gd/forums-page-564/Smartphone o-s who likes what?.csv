559257,Governator,2011-03-07 22:04:00,879,"  The higher end blackberrys are just as quick or close to it.  Obviously having a middle man can slow things down the odd time.  Also if the BIS Server ever goes down (And it does occasionally) then you won't receive any emails temporarily which can be a big pain.  Doesn't happen often but it's not unheard of.  All of a sudden you get a batch of emails hours later lol.  Rogers offers 15 day returns on I think any cell phone, try what you want out and demand unlimited data for 2 months so you can test out your phone and learn your limits before you pick a plan.  This way you can monitor your usage with their software for a week of use and decide if it's going to cost you too much.  This way you can pick any phone you want without any worry of repercussion."
559271,scugpg,2011-03-07 22:17:00,1373,Atrix looks awesome....covers what the Samsung Galaxy doesn't have (LED flash and front facing camera.) Also does 720p video!
559301,jjcanoe,2011-03-07 23:49:00,744," not to mention the cool laptop dock, fingerprint reader and projector attachment!  Might be too much phone for me though"
559466,SlowPoke,2011-03-08 12:45:00,2984,"JJ, I assume you are dropping the 10-4 feature? I have BB Bold 9700 on Rogers and love it. BBM is a great feature. I don't get into the app's and use it more as business phone so it's the obvious choice for me. It handles documents and email very well. It's not the best multi media option out there (camera/video/browsing/streaming/mp3) but it does all that adequetly. Foremost, I like the keyboard and trackpad."
559537,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-08 16:08:00,10439,"  And when Blackberrys new tablet (The Playbook) is released later this spring it will connect via bluetooth your Blackberry phone for doing email, working on documents, surfing the net when no wifi is available etc."
559614,jjcanoe,2011-03-08 21:35:00,744," heard from a few people now that the 10-4 system will be phased out soon, can't see myself getting a new 10-4 phone for the same price as a smartphone and then being stuck with a regular old flip phone for the remainder of my contract when they discontinue the service"
561717,jjcanoe,2011-03-14 18:34:00,744,"  Thanks all! I ended up with a Blackberry Torch, the data compresion feature sealed the deal. now I just have to learn how to use it properly!(thanks in advance Slowpoke!)  jjcanoe"
562006,jedimaster,2011-03-15 14:51:00,3472,I have gone the Iphone route for about 6 months now and I miss my blackberry. If you are in touch with your email and your blackberry. You will go through severe withdrawl's when switching to an Iphone. I would seriously dumpe this Iphone 3Gs for my bold 9700 in a second...If of course my Blackberry was still with me..
562012,Dutchy,2011-03-15 15:22:00,416, Good choice John. Blackberry for the win.
562015,bigfish1965,2011-03-15 15:29:00,3382,Samsung Galaxy S  Champion of the phones!
558886,jjcanoe,2011-03-06 18:41:00,744,"going to be upgrading to a smartphone soon and was just wondering what type of operating system is prefered by most.  I have no idea how any of them work so I'll be starting from scratch, so being user friendly is a big plus, I am a fast learner though (just not the first on my block to adopt a new tech!)  If you can, let me know what you like and dislike about the o/s you are using, info on specific phones would also be helpful but my main concern is the o/s!  Thanks  jjcanoe"
558910,Burtess,2011-03-06 19:54:00,901,What about a BlackBerry?  As far as I know this is the only system to still be virus free.  Burt
558926,scugpg,2011-03-06 20:36:00,1373,"I'd look at the HTC and Samsung Android phones. Any kind of web browsing forget about Blackberry. Even with the torch it isn't quite there yet.  Android keeps getting better, and Apple has its place as well. I believe there is a high end HTC that has a slide out kb. If you do go Android, make sure it will support OS 2.2 or 2.3"
558930,jjcanoe,2011-03-06 20:51:00,744,"yeah I can't believe I left out blackberry, I saw someone at the store with one a few minutes ago and I had to smack myself!  Poll edited!!"
558933,Bill Shearer,2011-03-06 20:53:00,456,"I've been a PC guy since day 1. Got an iTouch, and really loved it, so when I was due for an upgrade to my cell, the next logical step was an iPhone. I got the 3GS, and really enjoy it. Even with all that Rogers has to offer in the way of data and phone plans, it isn't cheap, but it certainly has been trouble free. Tons of free apps, as well as ones to pay for, but I've seen no need to pay for any yet. I can sit at home and surf or check emails, through the router or the 3G network, and have never gone over my data plan.Load up Skype, and you can make long distance calls for .03/min from your phone when on wifi or router.  Make sure to buy a roaming plan if you go to the US, or just shut roaming off. It can get expensive if you don't. Nobody I've talked with has had any virus problems with any iPhone.....yet."
558935,jjcanoe,2011-03-06 21:05:00,744,"Virus free is always a good thing, free bbmsg also is an incentive although I'm not a big texter since most of the time I have my phone on is when I'm driving the tractor-trailer. The touch screen on my wifes I-pod seems like an ok system to me, any advantage to the fold out keyboards? Not a fan of Samsung products in general due to several bad products I've used over the years from them....  jjcanoe"
558938,camillj,2011-03-06 21:30:00,1988,Love my new torch ... and love my iphone 3 ... wouldnt want to give either of them up (havent decided yet whether to upgrade to iphone 4 (probably will)  Either way fdont forget to go to m.google.com/search and download their app ... it is a MUST have ... voice activated google means never having to type
558941,Bill Shearer,2011-03-06 21:43:00,456, Have to agree with the voice google app! You won't believe how good it is till you try it!
559035,jjcanoe,2011-03-07 04:44:00,744,"so no votes for windows o/s yet, does that mean they're crap or just that no one has one?"
559037,Live2fish85,2011-03-07 04:51:00,1633,I would say the IPhone they are great phones I owned a Blackberry before and they are nice but some things that bugged me and bother people that own them but the IPhones I have heard nothing but good and they are very easy to use.
559039,bucktail,2011-03-07 04:58:00,1857,"The kids new samsung with the android os is sweet, as good as the apple for sure!"
559040,backbay,2011-03-07 05:10:00,773,"I'm really happy with my iPhone, although I found it irritating that I had to get a jacket for it. I like the camera, use the iTunes alot, and like the fact that you can use Skype. I used to missmy Blackberry's keyboard, but have grown to almost  like iPhone's."
559054,fish_fishburn,2011-03-07 11:48:00,1311,"I have the ACER LIQUID it's a really cool phone, and has a really decent camera as far as phone cameras go."
559063,vance,2011-03-07 12:42:00,719,"I will put a word in for my LG Shine Plus,it uses android and couldn't be happier with it.The stainless steel case sure keeps it from getting marked up.  vance"
559066,d_paluch,2011-03-07 13:09:00,343,"i love iOS found on the iphones. Ill go out on a limb and say thy have the best mobile browser.  Saying that, i am using symbian s60. Its okay, only got it because it was the best phone i could get within my budget! Try em all out, for simplicity and ease of use, iphone hands down"
559073,BillM,2011-03-07 13:37:00,17367,"HTC Desire Z here running Android 2.2.   I don't use half the bells and whistles, lol."
559092,scugpg,2011-03-07 14:31:00,1373,What carrier jjcanoe? Might help narrow out down
559093,Governator,2011-03-07 14:32:00,879,"Been a blackberry guy for 6 years but in regards to operating systems, I like Android phones the best.  I just can't get over the cost for data transfers on smartphones (compared to blackberry) which is why I won't switch."
559130,wolfville,2011-03-07 16:46:00,396,"If you are renewing your contract, make sure you bargain. When my contract with Rogers expired 3 months ago, I called and asked for iPhone 4. After like 5 calls (everyday I got a different offer) to see what they'd do to keep me, I got a sweet deal. For about $42/month including everything, I got 500mb data, 250min any time, 100min long distance, 100 text, unlimited weekend and week evening starting at 6pm. This on a new 3 yrs contract and the iPhone 4 then comes free. A lot of people don't like a contract but if it doesn't bother you, this is the way to go. It's about what I used to pay for a lot less."
559224,jjcanoe,2011-03-07 20:53:00,744,"I will be renewing with Bell, since I've been a satified cell customer of theirs for almost 20 years. Won't ever pay Rogers a penny ever again and Telus doesn't have the coverage I need.  As far as renewing and upgrading goes, I can't remember the last time I've been charged a renwal fee, admin fee, upgrade fee, transfer fee, or any type of fee by Bell, not that they haven't tried, one just has to know how to talk to them   by this do you mean the data rates charged (xxxmb for $X per month)? If so, how does Blackberry differ? do they have a flat rate kind of deal?  thanks jjcanoe"
559228,scugpg,2011-03-07 21:02:00,1373,I'd be really looking at their top end htc phones jj
559233,Governator,2011-03-07 21:07:00,879," No no no, basically when you have a blackberry you are also get a thing called Blackberry Internet Service (BIS).  When you browse the web on a blackberry all data goes through the BIS Server then to your phone.  THe BIS server compresses the data to 5-6 times smaller than the original content and then the blackberry opens the compressed data on the phone.  Think of it like a .zip file, someone might compress 10MB of files to a 3MB zip file to send you an email.  After you receive it you open it up and get the full 10MB of data.  That's essentially what happens on a blackberry.  Basically if you have a blackberry you get away with MUCH smaller data plans compared to a smartphone like iphone or android.  They don't compress their data at all, it's just as if you're browsing on your PC with the same data going through.  So if you go browse the web, use a facebook app, get emails, etc. and download 100MB of data in a day, you would've only downloaded 10-20MB on your blackberry.  BIG savings long term."
559246,jjcanoe,2011-03-07 21:44:00,744, Liking the Desire and also the Motorola Atrix (not out yet) It's got a dual core!!! imagining it'll be pricey though  ATRIX
559247,jjcanoe,2011-03-07 21:45:00,744," That would be handy, is speed an issue?"
559249,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-07 21:48:00,10439," Not different in the way they charge, just different in the way they deliver their mail. Blackberry's mail delivery is compressed while all the others are not. With Blackberries being oriented toward buisiness customers they have optomized their mail delivery subsystem.  As has been said they also compress web data."
