560252,Sharkbait22,2011-03-10 14:56:00,297,I'm not the best advocate for CBC but I do appreciate the radio stations 1 2 and 3.  CBC is often the only game in town in the north and provides good weather information for anglers and the odd good story.  http://www.friends.ca/ILoveCBC/
560348,misfish,2011-03-10 20:08:00,29133,Done  I too like the radio stations.  Laugh Out Loud  Vinyl Cafe  Randy Bachman's Vinyl Tap  Saturday Night Blues
560366,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-10 20:38:00,0,"i don't listen to commercial radio much given that it's the same 50 songs all the time and most of the hosts are doorknobs. on fishing trips i love to pester my friends with talk radio on CBC! i'm a big fan of Q, Vinyl Cafe, and Conrad Edgebick's wine segment on Ontario Today."
560450,spincast,2011-03-11 00:47:00,3279,"I'm in -- many places up north camping its the only radio; don't listen as much since the format change a few years ago, but its still #1 on my presets. - and I second the Dr's comments - well most of them, can't say I ever listened to the wine segment. My wife would if she knew about it - but then I would hear more whining about wine, so thats one more secret to keep (along with my fishing budget). - not that I dont enjoy a glass of wine once in a while - but for me a quality micro brew will beat out a glass of vino anyday. Don't suppose they have a beer show too do they?"
560471,Rod Caster,2011-03-11 01:43:00,5784,"with satelite radio, I listen to less CBC than I did before but it's the only FM channel I listen to. Vinyl Cafe, Vinyl Tap, This is That, Wiretap, Debators, Quirks and quarks and others...all fantastic, intelligent shows.  It's MUCH easier to ignore the Bull on CBC than it is to ignore the obnoxious crap on other commercial stations...as Dr. S eluded to.  "
560488,Bernie,2011-03-11 02:01:00,3190,"I listen to CBC a lot as well.....but RC, Wiretap intelligent? Ha!"
560491,Rod Caster,2011-03-11 02:04:00,5784,"  Goldstein has his moments.... His show is silly but genius at the same time.  Edit: ...it's still better than the corporate, cookie cutter, obnoxious junk on FM."
560514,Sharkbait22,2011-03-11 02:55:00,297,Check out Wiretap Season 3: A Secret History of Famous Friends http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap/episode/ Fred and Barney get into it over the phone. Pretty funny.
560515,Bernie,2011-03-11 02:55:00,3190,"There are some programs that are very good, and some, to me, are very bad. Just depends on a persons tastes and interests. I enjoy ""Q"" most of the time, Vinyl tap, Quirks & Quarks, Vinyl Cafe, Saturday night Blues and a few more."
561461,cwpowell,2011-03-13 22:19:00,265,My girlfriends dad is the operations manager for cbc radio in toronto so he has a big job there. i will definitely be signing this.
561471,Handlebarz,2011-03-13 22:44:00,3790,Done dad and I spent many nights way up north with just the CBC playing for us late at night.
561472,Terry,2011-03-13 22:45:00,14456,I don't think I have watch their tv stations in years   and don't know if I have ever listened to any of their radio stations......    I hate that my taxes support them
561491,misfish,2011-03-13 23:55:00,29133, Open yer mind and get off hack satilite.
