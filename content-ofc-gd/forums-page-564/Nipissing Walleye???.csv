559952,Headhunter,2011-03-09 18:22:00,5703,"I agree with much that you have said here... but the rules that must be followed by resorts and in turn, their customers are on a completely difference playing field, than the NFN. We are talking about one group, that is essentially a federal concern and another that is almost entirely a provincial concern. Let's face it, those two distinct groups have a difficult time agreeing on anything, much less a powder keg situation as native rights and historical treaties. Bernie, thanks for the insight into the past, they say that we should, as thinking animals, use the past as a learning tool, but I find that human nature is to only concern ourselves with today... Looking forward to more discussion/input with Crosshair! HH"
559991,GBW,2011-03-09 19:42:00,8460,this has been a very good read so far.  a few things posted that have no value but that happens no matter what.
560032,crosshairs,2011-03-09 21:05:00,55,"I agree that this is a very good discussion, and everyone has an opinion. You have to respect people who stand up for what they beleive in whether they are right or wrong, they have the kahoonies to do so.  Please remember this is just my take on what I see, the opinions expressed are not those of the First Nation.  The lake has always been on up and down cycles, up until recently the spawning stocks have been increasing for the past 13 years. Then wamm last year and this year a sharp decline in spawning stock. What caused this??? Early ice out last year allowed for a longer spearing season, since the opening of the fish market perhaps more anglers feel the need to keep those slot size(remarks I have heard at sons hockey games, tim hortons), environmental changes? Personnally I feel we are naturally in a down cycle, but the other factors listed each had it's own little part to play.  In past Years the First Nation sat on stuartship councils and the likes but just like on the internet people can only take so much finger pointing, then you realize it is hopeless to try and participate. So the answer to your question HeadHunter about relationships with other shareholders is basically the same as it always has been the ""us and them"" mentallity.  The First Nation has been left out of the game from the beginning. Not just in Fisheries but forestry and mining and all Natural Resources. The First Nation's have been involved in all parts of these industries, but when government decideds to regulate and make management plans First Nations are left out of the equations. Please bare with me I am going somewhere with this. I'll stick with the lake issue, how can one of the biggest users of the lake be ignored when trying to create a sustainable plan? Of course sustainability is going to be questioned their plans were for anglers and forgot to include The First Nation.  First Nation people used to guide for bear hunting, then came bear management units now all areas are given to tourist operators. Again the First Nation has no place to continue or participate in their guiding activities. This is why the ""us and them"" mentallity still exists. And I can't see this disappearing anytime soon, the only economic return the first nation see's from the lake is the commercial fishing. If a first nation member wanted to build a tourist camp, it would be hard as we can't get loans/mortgages to build anything on reserve because banks cannot reposes anything on the First nation.  Anyhow, the First nation I think is worried about lake nipissing,their own fishery, and the protection of their treaty rights not the tourist outfitters."
560043,crosshairs,2011-03-09 21:25:00,55,"Suggestions to OMNR's approach, well here are a few I personnaly feel couldn't hurt.(and don't bite my head off please these are just my thoughts)  1. Work with the First Nation istead of distancing themselves. 2. Help train their fisheries officers to be full fledged CO's 3. They need to get a better handle on #'s of anglers and Fish being caught 4. Limit the amount of ice shacks allowed/or none at all 5. Negotiate with the First nation,eg. every 2nd year lake is closed all winter in exchange for no spearing or maybe no netting that same year. 6. Have a fee for commercial ice huts and that money be put into lake nipissing eg(100 commercial huts x $500 = $50,000)lol almost the mnrs budget for the lake.  The OMNR just needs to start thinking outside the box and get a little creative. I think the omnr legal expertise needs to ease up and let the grassroots people do some ground breaking work.  If my First Nation (who fought court battles for fishing, fist fights with wardens, constant finger pointing) can get together and be where they are at with Fisheries management, I'm sure all people around lake nipissing can get through some personal battles and do what is right for the lake.  I'll try and get on here tommorrow for a little bit again. again Thank you all for having open minds and being curious about this very sometimes heated topic. Have a good evening everyone."
560089,aplumma,2011-03-09 23:23:00,6896,   Those seem to be reasonable options to consider. I hope at the end of this thread that this thread can be printed out and read by the powers that be on both sides.  Art
560360,Headhunter,2011-03-10 20:32:00,5703,"Hey Crosshairs, thanks for hanging in the thread... Us against them is a pretty common thing these days, regardless of what the topic is. I gather that through the years, a great deal of distrust has been festering and as such, I can see where that comes from. I am however concerned about the expectation that the MNR will step up with money for Nip. I can only imagine the screams that will come from anglers far and wide, about how their license dollars are being spent to fill NFN nets. I know that I would have concerns with that. I know I am speaking to the choir here with regard to anglers following the rules with regard to the slot and possesion numbers... I have yet to personally meet any OFC'er who has delberately broken a rules, so if that is indeed a problem on the lake, I haven't seen it; that doesn't by any means suggest that it doesn't happen. I don't know if getting money from outfitters is a possibility either. Is there enough nmoney in the pool to share? I was up there a few weeks back and was well within eye shot of the ice condos and it appeared to me that at least half, were un-occupied. But I think you make a good point about all stakeholders having a say in the future of the lake. But that starts to get back into the us against them thing again, doesn't it. HH"
560367,Headhunter,2011-03-10 20:38:00,5703,"Oh, I forgot to mention that I think point number 5 in your above post has a great deal of merit... both sides of this discussion are going to have to give and take, for a middle ground to be found. Legislating winter closure is a relatively easy thing to do, to anglers who require a license... but based on what you have indicated in your earlier posts, I'm guessing that enforcing such an agreement might prove to be difficult, for the First Nations to enforce, amoung their people. How do you tell someone who has treaty rights to not spear in the spring, when they are only looking to provide some protein to their family... it's a pretty complicated situation, isn't it. HH"
560371,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-10 20:43:00,0,The MNR recently ceased it's lake trout stocking on Lake Superior.  I'm interested to see what impacts this will have on the shoals targeted commercially versus those that aren't.
560381,crosshairs,2011-03-10 21:18:00,55," Thus far it is the community driving everthing that has been done to date. On top of that, treaty Rights are not individual rights. They are cummunal in nature, what one person does has affects on everyone in the community. So I can see some huge steps being made because this is community driven. The community has actually said that some regulation must go on the spearing, and I am assuming discussions are not in place on that topic.  And yes it is very complicated, but also very intersting. The true test of the First nations laws will be when the courts recognize them (as in BC where some FN community fishing laws are actually in the Federal Fisheries Act, then larger fines or incarceration will help deter the few bad apples from breaking their own laws. Our regulations can be modified quite quickly 4-6 months while the crowns turn around time is approximately 2 yrs, if I'm not mistaken.  I'll be gone for a while, kids have hockey all this weekend, and march break so I'll be outta town but take care all, if time permits I'll try and peek in."
561405,Nipfisher,2011-03-13 18:58:00,2449,Was a good end to the season on Callander Bay. We fished from noon on Saturday until 10pm. We caught 9 walleye and a handfull of perch. Most of the walleye were small and 2 were in the slot size. We also caught one mudpuppy. Then our friend (Bertrand93) was back out this morning and he caught 5 walleye and 3 perch and 1 herring. He may have caught more after we left as we pulled the huts off today.
561407,Joeytier,2011-03-13 19:17:00,3990,I'll be out there either tomorrow or Tuesday evening for one last kick at the can.
561409,Nipfisher,2011-03-13 19:23:00,2449,P.M. me.  Maybe I'll head out with you? At least I'll tell you where we got them.
561412,Joeytier,2011-03-13 19:42:00,3990,"I'd probably be headin' out solo anyway, so yeah give me a shout."
559497,crosshairs,2011-03-08 14:23:00,55,"What we do know is we've been gill netting lake nipissing commercially for centuries (documented by the jesuits). More recently there are actually less people netting, more regulations on them and a quota set in place. For the fishery to change so dramatically in the last 10-20 years what has happened differently to negatively impact the fishery?  The commercial fishery has changed, but for the better. Are more anglers on nipissing? We don't know there is no accurate data on how many anglers or how much fish is being caught by them. Is there more Tourist outfitters on the lake? I don't know, but everything was fine until around 2003-2004 and the commercial fishery prior to 2003 was bigger then it is now and had been for centuries. Something new happened but what was it? More Anglers, a New native community netting on nipissing (treaty area is quite large), environmental changes.  Not sure, but Nipissing First Nation is the ones finding and leading the research into other avenues while the OMNR sits back and reviews their work. A Pretty bleak picture is being painted by the ""Managers of the Lake"", this is why the First Nation is now taking their stance."
559503,Headhunter,2011-03-08 14:41:00,5703,"Crosshairs, you seem to have your finger on the pulse of this issue, so please bare with me on this... Hypothetically, lets say, only for discussion's sake, an individual with status is caught by NFN, netting outside of the ""rules"" suggested by NFN. What are the ramifications, those individuals can expect to face, as a result of their actions? Thanks, HH"
559522,crosshairs,2011-03-08 15:48:00,55," Nipissing First Nations Regulations only apply to Nipissing First nation members. Nipissing has proven in court that they have always commercially fished nipissing. If other status fisherman are seen they are reported to the omnr, and then it is upto the ministry to find out if they are fishing for sustenance or commercially.  If an NFN member is found netting outside the rules depending on the severity of the offence it may range from a warning down to a meeting with the justice circle. (the justice circle is made up of elders, compliant commercial fisherman, Anishnabek Police sevices, general concerned community members.) Here the person admits their guilt, explains to their peers why they chose to do what they did, and are assigned a penalty. Penalties range from community service, donations of fish to elders and the food bank, attending educational sessions on various topics, writing letters of appology to the community, suspension of fishing permit, and the use of the communities fedarally ispected fish processing facility will be off limits for a set time frame.  Remember this is a very small community, and the embarassment faced by the guilty party and their families to the community is quite a strong tool. Recently I have heard that Chief and Council are also looking into having set fines for each possible offence.  We have to remember, that until the communities law is challenged in court the courts won't recognize these laws. Hence the justice circles."
559534,Headhunter,2011-03-08 16:06:00,5703,"Thanks for that explanation Crosshairs... so there are no monetary repercussions? It seems to me that such actions (Netting outside of jurisdiction) could potentially have an ill effect on all stake holders... including the NFN... why not consider confiscation of their tools, to help keep them in line? HH"
559561,crosshairs,2011-03-08 18:09:00,55,"You are correct, that has been there most effective tool. Nets being confiscated seems to really catch all commercial fishermans attention."
559577,Mike01,2011-03-08 19:09:00,378,"I give up....there is no point in arguing facts and opinions on here, it only frustrates me further.  I just don't want to see the lake that I grew up on and have so many fond memories of being decimated to a point were my boys don't get to have the same experiences that I did.  I do my part to help the lake, I clean up garbage and debris on the ice after the huts are off.  I make sure my boat is maintained properly so it's not leaking fluids.  I release most of my fish except for the occasional family meal, and never keep fish in the slot size.  I just hope that everybody cares as much as I do and does their part to keep Lake Nipissing a productive fishery for years to come.  Mike"
559583,Headhunter,2011-03-08 19:22:00,5703,"Mike, I believe that most if not all of us have the same feelings as you. I know I do. That being said, we have here a person in the know, Crosshairs, who has been good enough to pass along the NFN position and has done so in an articulate and respectful way... I appreciate that and would like to have this discussion continue here, in the same manner. It's obvious to me anyway, that what's happening on Nip isn't going to change. There is no will on any side of this issue, to make/force a change, that won't end up getting really ugly for all sides of the ""net"", so to speak.  Crosshairs, you mentioned earlier that NFN ""puts back""... can you please describe what it is that NFN puts back into the fishery? Thanks, HH"
559610,crosshairs,2011-03-08 21:25:00,55,"""puts back"" was just refering to the money they put into enforcement and assessment. They are doing alot of work with the Lake Sturgeon, musky and Bass. I know in the past they were doing alot of ice out trap netting and gathering data on the musky, bass and Northern pike. We all know not enough money is put into lake nipissing, I think the OMNR needs to start looking outside the box.  The First Nation has fisheries officers out on the water 4-5 days a week, why not use them to help with angler enforcement and works the other way as well. Here is 2 organizations trying to do the best they can for the lake with limited funds, it's time to put the past behind them and work together.(alot of history between the 2)  Everyone has the same goal in mind for the lake, healthy productive lake for all future generations to enjoy. Just a side bit of information, if the lake nipissing fishery crashes so does the treaty rights of all NFN community members(commercial and angler). So the community has alot at stake, they are determined to get this done right.  Not all set nets, actually a small minority actually set nets. Most are anglers like the rest of us, just want to bring their kids out and maybe catch a little snack. Whether fish are caught or not I feel it is time well spent.  Teaching all our youth is the key to the lakes future. All biases must be put aside and both sides must be willing to give. Have a great night folks."
559684,Rod Caster,2011-03-09 00:51:00,5784,"Thanks for the great questions HH and great answers Crosshair. This thread has been a fine read.  The MNR doesn't have the funds to keep Nipissing healthy so we can't just rely on them.  Us locals need to take the energy we put into blaming others and redirect it towards protecting the fishery.  As Mike01 said, I also try to do my part in respecting the lake by putting most of the fish back (i also keeps snacks), but I should probably do more since I use the lake so often.  Are there any other NGO groups that work towards keeping lake Nipissing healthy?  For the record, I've done pretty good on Nipissing this year."
559696,Bernie,2011-03-09 01:29:00,3190,Depends where you are fishing RC.  To the best of my knowledge Callander Bay/ Deepwater and the North Bay water front isn't being netted...yet. Callander Bay has many shacks and anglers fish it rather heavy. But there are still fish there. Same as the North Bay waterfront area. I fish the South Bay and occasionally the French River. Both are areas that the nets have been used extensively. I guess I'll have to head over that way if I want to catch a Pickerel in the future.
559703,Nipfisher,2011-03-09 01:40:00,2449, Room for you in my shack any time you want Bernie. Same goes for you Clayton. No biasses here. I don't like the odd 40-50 inch muskie that accidentally dies in the nets but that is my only issue.
559727,Bernie,2011-03-09 02:28:00,3190,"Thank you for the offer Nipfisher.  I rarely fish in the winter although I am out at the lake almost every winter weekend puttering around the cottage or reading a book by the fire. The summertime on the other hand  I do enjoy heading out on the water and throw out the anchor to enjoy an evening of fishing. Use to be I could go to one spot, catch a couple and have a snack for supper. Now I need to go from one spot to another just to find one. My brother fishes out on the other side of Lonely Island and does OK but even there it's not the way it was only a few years ago."
559730,bucktail,2011-03-09 02:40:00,1857,"Man they need to close that fishery for 4 years to EVERYONE! When i was younger it was the place to go, now a echo of what it used to be. With no hope for the future unless everyone comes to the table"
559858,Headhunter,2011-03-09 14:11:00,5703,"Thanks for your response Crosshairs... I typically don't get on here in the evening, so I am only now, seeing your response... SO, if I have read the above correctly, what you are saying is that NFN is ""putting back"" by enforcing rules that they themselves have agreed upon as well as spreading the wealth accumulated within the community. With regard to the MNR's approach to Nip... what would you suggest they do that would be in the best interest of all of the lakes stakeholders? It seems to me anyway, that any stocking effort they could put forth, would only result in those fish, being netted for NFN commercial use... with the other stake holders, ie local non Natives and the average ""tourist"" not necessarily benefiting. Remember, Nip is a shared resource for all citizens to enjoy. Places like this fine fishing board draw an awful lot of traffic, both registered as well as guests... and as more and more people view Nip as a less than desirable location, due to overwhelming fishing pressure, Nip will not their destination of choice. That could result in business that support the tourist trade, failing. And should those businesses fail, it will directly affect the tax base that supports the infrastructure of the area. This leads me to my next question... what relationship does NFN have with the other stakeholders on the lake? Have there been any dicussions about striking a balance between the various stakeholders? I find this topic fascinating and look forward to continued dialogue. HH"

So as word of mouth travels over the years that nip fishing isn't that good ,less people would be heading to Nip resulting in less pressure on the lake ,With a final result that the fishing would then increase? Maybe you guys should keep telling everyone the fishing sucks so less and less head out on Nip. In 20 yrs it'll be a gold mine."

559871,Headhunter,2011-03-09 14:51:00,5703," So the economic wasteland, left by a lack of tourists and the resulting devistation it will have on the tax base of the area has no bearing on your thoughts? 20 years is a long time to wait, for your revenue stream to return... seems kinda selfish to me! This is why I asked Crosshairs to discuss how the NFN is working with the other stakeholders on the lake. HH"
559886,Nipfisher,2011-03-09 15:31:00,2449," H.H. I live here and pretty much only fish Nipissing although there are many other ""more productive"" lakes in the area. I would love to see less pressure on Nip. I'm with Buster..there are no walleye left in this lake. Randy must have photo-shopped that picture...lol."
559889,canadadude,2011-03-09 16:00:00,769,"nice my favorite area come March,there doing well considering the Southern Ontario weekend warriors have declared Walleye extinct on Nipissing hahahahaha.  The fact is the Lake may have gone through a period of decline but this is normal,it's happened many times before on Nipissing. The lake has also gone through periods of way above average stocks,some people think the bonanza years are normal.Maybe there is some area of concern but I think Nipissing will bounce back."
559896,canadadude,2011-03-09 16:15:00,769,"Perhaps the other stakeholders on the lake hire a Biologist, do some assement,promote catch and release, follow the slot rules. There only argument is completly stop the Native Fishery or screw the slot the fish are all going to be netted anyway. I don't see this atitude in anyway helping, at least the NFN is on the right track by managing it's take from the lake and doing everything possible to keep the fishery sustainable.If the tourist operators rely so much on the fishery perhaps it's time they also took a stand on managing the resource."
559899,Headhunter,2011-03-09 16:20:00,5703,"Well, I'm glad you ""think"" it will bounce back, but if I were a stake holder I wouldn't find much solice in your hope alone. And making comments about ""southern Ontarians"" is in no way constructive to this discussion. Without those ""weekend warriors"", the the economics of the region would suffer greatly... but that doesn't seem to be an issue to you... as you seem to have all the fish YOU can use. Based on Crosshair's responses, the ecomomic benefit of NFN is only being shared by NFN, unless I am reading this wrong, which I will admitt, is entirely possible. Again, I am trying to understand this situation and consider us to be fortunate to have people like Crosshairs, in the know and conversing. I guess that if it makes you feel better to bash, then discuss, I can't stop you from doing that. HH"
559902,canadadude,2011-03-09 16:38:00,769,"The restaurants and fish markets in NorthBay and area who purchase the NFN catch are not benefiting economically, I don't think they give the fish away for free.Tourists who don't fish can now enjoy a meal of Nipissing Walleye and I'm sure the restaurants and fish markets also enjoy a econmic benefit from being able to provide others with fresh local fish"
559910,Headhunter,2011-03-09 16:58:00,5703,"Ok Canadadude, I can see that having limited benefit to a small cross section of the Nip region... that being said however, (and of course, I don't have access to the numbers) I wonder how much money those restaurants provide to the region as a whole, in comparison to the large number of resorts and the numbers of secondary support services in the area. *****I just want to make one thing clear here, I am not trying to do anything here, except understand the lay of the land in the area. I have in the past, expressed my personal thoughts on what's happening, but have come to the conclusion that I did not possess the knowledge to make any kind of an informed personal fact based decision. Like most here, I am a ""stakeholder"" based on my license dollars as well as my tax dollars and recreation dollars. I really do appreciate those who have been constructive in the dicussion, their insight and knowledge and their willingness to share it... I do hope that this discussion stays this way... after all this is a dicussion board and I think we all have some interest in the information being presented. HH"
559942,Bernie,2011-03-09 18:01:00,3190,"Headhunter, thank you for your level discussion procedure. This is the proper way to do it.  Yes, there are places that do harbor fish yet. But most certainly not the way it should be. In my lifetime and my fathers as well the fishing has never been this poor.  Perhaps at the turn of the century from the 1800's. At that time many species were harvested to the point of extinction. And from what I understand it wasn't the natives at that time.  I believe at that time the blue pickerel was wiped out completely. Not entirely sure of the details."
559116,Mike01,2011-03-07 16:24:00,378,"So let me get this straight.... Your telling me the reason I didn't catch as many walleye this year as I have years past is because I'm not adapting to the ""new"" fishery.  I'm not one of those weekend warriors of guys from down South that are here for a week.  I spend any available time I have on the water and am even thinking of running a charter business in the years to come.  The unregulated netting of the lake in the last 50 years has brought the walleye population to its proverbial knees.  Maybe they are doing a better job now but IMO the damage has already been done.  Mike"
559135,Bernie,2011-03-07 16:53:00,3190,"From my perspective.  Summer fishing by anglers is nowhere near what it was even 20 years ago. Tourist operators are quiet in comparison to what it once was. In the last few summers when I am out on the water I have to look for other boats on the water, even on long weekends. At one time you had to get out early to get your ""spot"". Yes, there are more shacks out there in winter (less this year) but many of them do not get used on a regular basis. Up until 5 years or so ago on the south end of the lake I could go out and catch a few fish. Then the nets started coming down here because the pickerel were getting scarce in the French River area. As soon as this happened the fishing got tough. The fishery is doomed at the present pace. A few years ago they introduced the slot size. Most follow the rules, yes, there are exceptions. The reasoning the exceptions use is that the slot size fish end up being the ones the netters like to keep. While I do believe they are wrong for keeping them, I understand their reasoning.  Does Simcoe get netted? How is the fishery there? How many anglers? Just asking.  Sorry to add fuel to the fire, but I believe ignoring this is sticking heads in the sand. The MNR heads must be up to their butt by now. They don't want to address the problem either."
559152,canadadude,2011-03-07 17:32:00,769,"There is way more comercial ice fishing operations on Nipissing in the last 10-15 yrs,the invention of the ""Ice Bungalos"" put dozens more operators on the lake.At one time perhaps %50 of tourist operations put huts out and ran viable winter fisheries,now it seems every operator puts out Bungalos, weather they are a lodge or not.The explosion of ice fishing gear also has pressured the populations, now anglers just don't rent a hut for the weekend they come up with ATV's, sonars portable huts the populations take a beating all winter. This along with everything else has beat up the population, the natives are trying to improve on there end but the sportfishers and tourist operators have made no attempt except for alot of whinning and crying.Baning one groups livelyhood to improve yours is not the answer or is it going to happen.  As for lake Simcoe the only reason a viable fishery exsists is because of heavy stocking efforts for years, if left to natural populations Lake Simcoe would be nothing but perch and bass fishery"
559160,Bernie,2011-03-07 17:50:00,3190,"I'm on the lake more days than most anyone I know and have been for 54 years. I know how it works. Moratorium? It's done when the ice is still on the lake and they can't net anyway because it is impassible. It's just PR to put in the newspaper and to Bull those that don't realize it. When nets are stretched across the entire river mouth and populated shoals the fish don't stand a chance.  Not all the fish that are netted are put into the quota list. There are those that are on their own. They have admitted this and have said they would rectify that. I hope so.  Not sure why I am arguing this as it seems it only goes nowhere, not my intention, I'd like to see solutions. It won't matter soon because there will be nothing left to argue about.  There is no simple answer."
559162,canadadude,2011-03-07 17:56:00,769,I totaly agree there are no simple answers
559167,Headhunter,2011-03-07 18:15:00,5703,"Well, I believe that the answers are pretty simple, but simply not palitable to special interest groups. HH"
559176,Spiel,2011-03-07 18:42:00,9065," They don't stock bass or perch in Simcoe as you well know and the perch fishery is hammered year round but continues to hold up to the most angler pressured lake in the province.    Mind you they don't net them either.  The Lakers and Whitefish are stocked due to the eutrophication of the lake and loss of suitable spawining grounds, not because of fishing pressure. Eutrophication is obviously a man made issue but the Lake Trout and Whitefish are starting to show signs of natural recovery due in part to the reduction of phosphorus loading, but of course there is no netting. A moratorium on Herring as shown a vast improvement of their numbers as well, but then again they're not netted.  Nipissing could be a world class fishery and guided charters along with local tourist oriented business' could bring in vast sums of money for all commercial business in the area, netting only brings in money for a select few and of course selective harvest along with catch and release can't be applied to gill nets!"
559184,crosshairs,2011-03-07 19:11:00,55,"As I have stated on many posts before all the First nations fish are accounted for. The handfull of those who maynot record the proper numbers or donot report any are all taken into consideration and estimates are added to cover those fish. Why would the first nation spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to protect the resource and then make up numbers. Come on people.  As for the Moratorium happening when the ice is still on, last year people were driving by boat and spearing at lonely island by april 6th. The moratorium runs from April 1st through May 10th when little if any walleye are seen still on the shoals. Again if they wanted PR they would do a fish hatchery.  Fish hatcheries Lets see, we'll take a hundred thousand eggs from Nippising fish (that were gonna end up on the spawning bed anyways)put them in a hatchery and when they hatch lets put them back in nippissing so the natural ones(which are bigger) can eat them. Hatcheries are for give and take lakes. Nipissing is a very productive lake.  And there are no simple solutions, the first nations picture though looks alot better than the angling side. Sure they may take the most fish but the FNation is spending triple the amount than the ontario government into the lake, plus making all the decisions to manage themselves voluntarily while the ontario government cuts back on assessment and even cancelling creel surveys where they get the data for numbers of fish caught by anglers. No one even knows how many anglers are out there per year, let alone how many fish being caught. The First Nation has a pretty good grasp i think on the 15 or so Commercial fisherman they have. The compliance rate if tested will benefit the first nation.North shore is terrible for docks so 80% of all boats are using the couple of boat launches which makes it pretty easy to monitor.  These are just some facts, not the Tim Hortons retorhic that some here feel the need to spew. I would like to know what has any other organization put into lake nipissing? Not spending on meetings or PR hatcheries but money actually going into lake nipissing.  Nipissing First nation has an on reserve population of approximately 1000 people and they are spending lets say $300,000/yr which equals $300 per person/yr, perhaps all communities on lake nipissing put in $300/person to properly manage this resource."
559187,Spiel,2011-03-07 19:18:00,9065," All right, educate me please. What happens to all of the non desirable/marketable species that are taken in the gill nets?"
559188,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-07 19:24:00,0,"i think there's some suspect mismanagement of the fishery involved but this subject is exhausted.  because our resources are so important, i can only hope that we all remember these things at election time. "
559191,Headhunter,2011-03-07 19:31:00,5703,"Helpful and very well thoughtout Doc! Here, we have just now had some info being discussed and you throw that out there... My guess would be that the time you spend on Nip is ZERO! I bet your response would have been different if your family cottage was on Nip, vs the barking you have been doing about your own little piece of paradise being invaded. HH"
559195,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-07 19:38:00,0,"sorry hh... i added a message afterwards while i was editing.  i didn't mean it as a disrespect to the issue, because privately i get very riled up about this kind of stuff.  the wise crack picture was just to poke fun at how this issue comes up every few weeks... not unlike the cormorants, flossing, and all the rest of the never ending arguments.  trust me, we're on the same side."
559197,Headhunter,2011-03-07 19:41:00,5703,  HH
559205,crosshairs,2011-03-07 19:56:00,55," The non desirable species you speak of are Herring, sucker, Fresh water drum (sheephead)and catfish. The herring have a mite that makes them illegal to sell to public. Even the perch have been hard to sell for some because they have a stone (calcium build up) within the meat. Personnally I eat perch all the time and only came across this once. As for how are they disposed of, just like any commercial fishery they are thrown out. Great lakes and oceans they are dumped right back in the lake, here some are put in the lake others are dumped out. Some fish are given to community members. The Fisherman have sales for walleye,pike,whitefish,some perch,silver bass."
559212,Headhunter,2011-03-07 20:21:00,5703,"You can't justify actions on Nip, by comparing it to the Great Lakes or the oceans... for obvious reasons. HH"
559220,crosshairs,2011-03-07 20:37:00,55,"Not justifying, just stating as with any commercial fishery there will be bi-catch. And it will be disposed of. The volumes caught are to small scale for larger industries such as pet food etc. Ideas on how to use these fish are welcome I'm sure. Some community members can suckers, and make them into patties but this is a only a few people."
559223,Joeytier,2011-03-07 20:41:00,3990,Crosshairs:  Just curious as to where the money being 'spent on nip' is going to.  I'm not sure I understand how that helps to counteract gill netting in a naturally reproductive lake.
559250,crosshairs,2011-03-07 21:49:00,55," The First Nation has created it's own manegement for the commercial fishery. They have a biologist on staff who has created a manegement plan for their fishery, they have established their own enforcement unit and assessment unit. Until this happened the netting was unregulated. This is voluntary, the first nation can fish commercially with out interference from the government. They are using a management system which is recognized world wide (scientifically defensable in courts), which includes OMNR numbers of angler harvest.  This money isn't used to couter act gill netting but used to ensure it is being done in a sustainable manner. The First Nation is doing it by the book because they are ready to be challenged, their numbers, management system and assessment. If we are to look at all the facts who's fishery is actually the regulated one?  The one where I've fished 20 yrs and never seen a CO or the one where the fishery officers are doing audits on you and your catch every couple days.  The money just isn't there for the OMNR to properly manage this resource. How much tourism dollars are brought into the area from lake nipissing, just put 10% of the tax dollars collected from that revenue towards the fishery and I'm sure its more than the 70,000 the government puts into it now.  Just my thoughts, I don't get on here to often but if there are questions I'm more than willing to try and answer them if I can. Take Care all."
559273,Mike01,2011-03-07 22:20:00,378,"ok, this has gone way off the original topic but I'm gonna go with it.  The biologist that you guys speak of quit soon after being hired because he wasn't telling the first nation what they wanted to hear...  regardless of laws and rights Nipissing can not support a commercial fishery longterm because of the mis-management of the past.  tell me what beneficial social and economic impact gill netting has on the area surrounding lake Nipissing?"
559338,canadadude,2011-03-08 00:57:00,769,"It has an economic impact on the Band,they earn monies from fishing,it also has an econimic impact on resteraunts who now serve nipissing walleye dinners,and the fish market who sells nipissing fish.The quota system the native fishery follows and supports sustainability programs which means the lake will suport a commercial fishery.  Sport fisherman have to relize the fishery does not just belong to them,there are other players out on the lake. Instead of whinning and crying,get on board with the other players on the lake and invest in the fishery. The tourist operations on the lake have been on a free ride forever without putting a nickle back in, they just whine and complain mean while rapping the resource for years, for one thing profit."
559405,Nipfisher,2011-03-08 03:54:00,2449,I coppied this off of another site. Just saying there are still walleye to be caught on Nipissing. I did better this year then any of the last 3 years. I don't fish hard. I just like to sit in the hut and try to catch fish. I will fish much harder this summer.  Not my info......... Did the last trip for the season up to Nippising ..Greening Bay cottages . Great trip Ice was good lots of fish 36 keeper walleyes lots of perch enough for 9 guys and to many Ling to count and who would want to any way and oh yes a few herring
559413,blarg,2011-03-08 04:21:00,289," So any fish species is fair game no matter the impact the fish caught,sold or not, have on the fish population and overall balance of the lake.  You like to be portrayed as keepers of the lake but you can't have it both ways, you simply don't know, nor does your biologist know, what the long term impact of commercial fishing on the lake will be.  No doubt the cod fisherman cared about their fishery too, but that didn't stop their greed from killing it.  I genuinely hope that doesn't happen here, but if it does im sure those of us who can't set gill nets will get blamed first.  I love the, 'they are eating more smelt' argument for why anglers are finding them harder to catch, but that argument never gets extended to why? And is the commercial netting of the lake changing the balance so that maybe more smelt are available to fewer walleye.  Who knows, it's complicated, but that is the point really, being native gill nets does not make them more environmentally sensible, the best of intentions aside.  But, this is a dead horse, we have rules to follow and you get to make your own rules, i just hope you know what you're doing."
559477,bubbles,2011-03-08 13:39:00,591," Yep, I agree best year in the past few for sure.  Plenty of eyes caught this year."
559485,crosshairs,2011-03-08 13:53:00,55," The biologist i speak has been here from the begining and is still here. He can be contacted at 753-2922. His name is Richard Rowe, he was the omnr biologist for lake nipissing prior to working with the first nation. Chief and Council has lowered the quota twice on his recommmendations. For the laws and management plan to be legal or defensible in court the science must be sound and follow principals recognized globally.  What impact does Tourist operators have on the First nation? What revenue does the First nation generate from all the people visiting and fishing on lake nipissing? Theey receive nothing, but put the most back into the lake. Nipissing First nation is taking a stance, and are going to be either Managing the whole lake or at the very least be in a co management agreement with your Government for all Management decisions on lake Nipissing."
559486,Headhunter,2011-03-08 13:57:00,5703,"I would hardly call the taxes paid by resorts a free ride! Without that tax revenue, there would be hardly any services provided to the area and those who are getting a free ride, would be much worse off then they are. Someone paid for the infrastructure there and I am betting it's the tax base. And that's certainly not the same group who have their own set of rules! HH"
555234,Mike01,2011-02-25 00:57:00,378,Is anyone catching fish!  I haven't caught a walleye in a month.  I've moved the shack around a few times and still can't seem to find them.  same story from most of the people I talk to.
555293,Joeytier,2011-02-25 03:37:00,3990,"I'm on a bit of a cold streak myself, but I'm bound and determined to change that this weekend"
555313,Nipfisher,2011-02-25 04:05:00,2449," Mike if you're gonna be out on South Shore talk to Rod Caster (Chad). He has been doing alright for the evening bite. I am getting a few eye, and hope my new spot is more productive. Where nis your shack now? In C. Bay, guys are doing well just past Wasi Falls and also in front of Terrace Suites."
555340,Mike01,2011-02-25 12:47:00,378,"I moved over right in front of lonely island.  There is a substantial depth change right off the rock point from about 10' to 30', I'm in about 24'. I'm heading out tonight and if I don't get anything, my shack is going up in flames!!! LOL!!!"
555349,Rod Caster,2011-02-25 13:28:00,5784,Where is Lonely Isle? C.Bay?  Mostly it's been the same for me this year...perch all day and 45 minutes of walleye at dusk.  
555366,Mike01,2011-02-25 14:26:00,378,It's at the east end of the mouth of south bay.
555755,Joeytier,2011-02-26 22:59:00,3990,Just got off the ice.  Iced a couple keepers under the slot off Deepwater point.  Got them out in 38 FOW.  thought i'd try a little deeper
555777,Swan_Dive,2011-02-26 23:54:00,46,Don't be saying that your not catching fish on Nipissing!  Iam supposed to be going up for a fishing trip up there march 11th and we are hoping to catch a few walley.  Me and my fishing buddy haven't had any luck on simcoe this year so we were all excited to catch something other than perch.  Hopefully it turns around for you guys and hopefully we get lucky when we are up there and catch something bigger than a perch.
556198,Mike01,2011-02-28 03:16:00,378,"The fishing always slows down this time of year, first and last of the season are always best.  I'm sure you guys will have a good time regardless!"
556278,Headhunter,2011-02-28 14:06:00,5703,"Bring you Perch stuff cause there are no Pickereye's left on Nip... sad actually because I can tell that over the last three years, the numbers have dropped... Four guys fished two days at Bernie's this past weekend, one keeper Pickereye in places that we have historically netted fish... Gonna have to start looking at other bodies iof water, if I want to take home a feed... unless of course I want to catch perch! HH"

557795,Joeytier,2011-03-04 02:57:00,3990,"we've been hitting decent numbers of walleye on the south shore all month, but not much size to them at all.  biggest fish was maybe 15 """

557907,canadadude,2011-03-04 14:50:00,769,"I always found on Nip in march the Walleye slow down drasticly,there entering the prespawn and don't feed nearly as much.They are also migrating and staging closer to the spawning rivers and shoals. This being said they do still bite, but like said the window of oportunity is shorter maybe a 20min-45min bite at dusk.I use to fish closer to the French at the end of the season, the eye's seem to migrate towards the river systems.It is tough to get on fish and since the bite is ussually short if your not set-up at the magic hour you end with noth'in, it's a feast or famine type secnario this time of year.  I usually know the prespawn is coming when I start getting lots of herring in my traditional walleye spots"
558546,Mike01,2011-03-05 22:40:00,378,"Went out for the last time last night as I am heading to Florida next week.  Caught two eye's that were very aggressive at about 5:30 with a few perch mixed in, then everything pretty much shut off."

Anyway locals in the know caught plenty of Nipissing Walleye this winter and if Lake Nipissing isn't your cup of tea anymore go somwhere else and whine & cry about that fishery."

559102,canadadude,2011-03-07 15:15:00,769,"Netting is suspended during the spawn,thats one of the biggest issues that is being policed right now. I know quite a few locals who crushed the eye's this winter with more 5lb-9lb fish then ever, these dudes however worked to find the fish and didn't rely on the same old traditional spots. The fishery has changed and if you keep getting poor results you have to adapt or just keep getting the same results.The locals who are getting below average results are mostly the ones who don't change along with the fishery.The Southbay areas have taken a beating in the last 10yrs, day huts and the ""ice bungalos"" have trippled out there and people wonder why the area sucks. Thats easy constant pressure has taken it's toll, the funny thing is the fish are still there just alittle harder to catch.Walleye rarely slam spoons and jigs anymore but have turned into very light biters, sometimes you need your finger on the line to feel the fish as they are very warry of taking a bait."
559105,Headhunter,2011-03-07 15:27:00,5703,"They may be ""officially"" suspending netting during the spawn, but that hasn't stopped thoughs who stick their finger up at the offical declarations... it's happening and will continue to happen, until there is a full crash, then, things may change.
