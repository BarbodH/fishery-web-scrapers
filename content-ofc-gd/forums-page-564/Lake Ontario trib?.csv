My step son lives in the Mississauga area about a 2 minute walk from one of the main tribs.  If anyone is open to a few questions in a PM format, please send me one.  Thanks in advance  Splashhopper"
561850,steelie hunter,2011-03-14 23:36:00,55,"Lake O tribs are just like any other trib you have fished before. Just add an extra 19 cars to the parking lot, and add another 42 fisherman on the bank. I think that sums it up well lol"
561873,kingofthesteelhead,2011-03-15 00:35:00,140,"Lake O tribs.28 cars parked at the first one sunday mid-morning and the next one only 22 cars.Not many fish caught,only had a few hits with no hookups.Wonder why I am losing interest in this!"
561884,BillM,2011-03-15 00:50:00,17367,"The east ditches, combat fishing at it's finest!"
561887,camillj,2011-03-15 00:57:00,1988,I think this is just a little overstated... When you figure you have a mile or so of water its not that many people. The key is not standing in a crowd of 5 people chasing the same 5 fish... there's plenty of water if you are prepared to walk a bit
561889,ADB,2011-03-15 01:04:00,444," Funny how the best spots are always closest to the road, eh?"
561918,fishcrisp,2011-03-15 02:22:00,17,try exploring a bit.. there's lots of river with nobody on it. Its not as busy as so many ppl say.. the people that search the internet for places to go are the ones stuck with the crowds.
561923,kingofthesteelhead,2011-03-15 02:38:00,140,actually when I do have a good day it is within sight of a main road as most people keep walking right bye.Most of these fishable areas only have a few holding areas and that is where everybody concentrates.
561998,torco,2011-03-15 14:16:00,656,"I grew up fishing nothing but the east tribs and the key is to fish off hours and off days. If you can get out mid week the better and if you can get really early or late night that helps. I have found if you can't do that try starting at noon, yes its not prime steelhead time but if you have pool after pool to yourself you will find fish."
562070,camillj,2011-03-15 18:20:00,1988,Yep ... I have thousands of hours and a hundreds of fish to prove that a good time can be had (even in well known waters) if you are interested in going out and looking for it.  (Normally when I see more than two folks fishing an area I do little more than say hello and move on (no matter how many fish I see in front of them)... so I dont normally have trouble with the crowds ... and if someone crowds me out of a spot I am fishing ... I am happy to move on (normally back were they came from - because all those spooked fish will settle down sooner than most people realize) and come back when they are done 'muddying up my crick'  For me its about peace and quiet ... and that is just a simple choice you make .. not something that is done to you.
