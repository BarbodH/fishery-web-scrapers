561587,cynmar,2011-03-14 12:19:00,169,I am the proud new owner of a Shimano Citica 200E. Always a Daiwa man but the force drew me in. Not all the way though as picked up a sweet little Pflueger spinning reel as well. What does everyone think of the Voltaeus rods from Shimano?

I picked up a Curado 300E and a Compre at christmas, and am just itchin to try it out But l back them up with a nice Pflueger President on a Fennwick rod.I Like diversification"
