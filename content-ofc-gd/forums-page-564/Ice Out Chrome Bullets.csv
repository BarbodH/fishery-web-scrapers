561983,fishrking,2011-03-15 13:08:00,24,All the steelheaders seem to be coming out of the woodwork this last couple weeks. With the forcasted temps for later this week I imagine the local creeks will be pretty busy. Nice fish to both you guys - I love the little spring rockets. jf
561984,Cudz,2011-03-15 13:11:00,2652,awesome!

561785,solopaddler,2011-03-14 21:31:00,8605,"Thanks for the kind words everyone.     I'm stunned by your avatar pic. Is that a brookie? Welcome to the board btw.     Gord, anytime you'd like to join just ask! I'd be happy to show you the ropes."

561829,BillM,2011-03-14 22:57:00,17367,Mike PI's avatar is a giant splake!  There's a pic of it in the latest OOD...
561832,misfish,2011-03-14 23:03:00,29133,Hey Bill.pms are full.
561836,BillM,2011-03-14 23:10:00,17367,"Brian, should be good to go now bud"
561842,Cookslav,2011-03-14 23:29:00,1457,"That got my blood a pump'n!  Warmer temps, Geese fly'n north, birds singing and a Solo report....spring is definatly in the air.! Thanks for sharing"
561855,MJL,2011-03-15 00:06:00,2427,"Sweet report Mike...""chrome bullets"" they are  Nicely done guys  I got Thurs off and it can't come soon enough!"
561879,Rod Caster,2011-03-15 00:47:00,5784,Great stuff.  The ultimate ice breaker.
561902,alphaalpha,2011-03-15 01:23:00,475,Great report! now that I am done with the hardwater I am looking forward to the rivers.  It's good to see they are becoming fishable.  Thanks for sharing!
561903,msp,2011-03-15 01:25:00,1336,Nice steelies. I was wondering what happened to your posts. It looks very cold out there!
561904,Moosebunk,2011-03-15 01:28:00,3970,Mike and steelhead!  That's what has been missing around here for a time now.
561905,BillM,2011-03-15 01:28:00,17367," Warm enough for the guides not to freeze   A few degrees above zero, but with the wind it felt a lot colder then it actually was."
561913,Skud,2011-03-15 01:58:00,739,Great pics. You most be feeling better these days now that you are getting out on the water again.
561921,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 02:28:00,2690,"  It's amazing how well that technique works, in off colour water.  I've caught more steelies using that combo, or pink bag/chartreuse yarn in dirty water than any other tactic.  Bright red/chartreuse is another winner, I know I'm not telling you anything new Mike, but, for any rookie steelheaders out there...this truly is a great off colour water tactic!"
561926,solopaddler,2011-03-15 02:46:00,8605," March is always a rebirth for me.    Absolutely, there's something about the contrasting colours they like.  Pink on pink or chartreuse on chartreuse doesn't work anywhere near as well."
561939,WeedLine,2011-03-15 03:26:00,322,"Right on, nice fish guys"
561972,Mike P,2011-03-15 12:15:00,19,"Solopaddler, as much as I would like to say it is a speck, BillM is right, it is a splake from the Ottawa valley."
561973,solopaddler,2011-03-15 12:31:00,8605, I kind of figured. Doesn't matter really that's an amazing fish regardless.
561592,solopaddler,2011-03-14 12:45:00,8605,"It's been a long winter for me. I've managed to sneak out here and there, but my work schedule and the arrival of a new puppy in early Jan have conspired to keep me mostly house bound.  My sanity was salvaged this past weekend when Bill and I managed to sneak away for a couple of days to a favourite river.  She had blown out days earlier and was finally wide open to the lake. Definitely off coloured but eminently fishable.  Incredibly over the course of two days we fished entirely by ourselves. An amazing occurence since it's a popular river. We weren't complaining though.  I think most people believed the river was too dirty.  That combined with the fact the access parking lot wasn't plowed kept the hordes away.    Getting in was no problem, but ascending the steep windy hill in my Accord was a bit sketchy on the way out.  Made it though.  Fishing was spectacular, the numbers of fish were ridiculous. I'd throw out a number but it might be hard to believe.  90% weren't big, but they were bright chrome bluebacked fish that fought with fury even in the cold water.  Giant chartreuse bags with a tag of pink yarn were the ticket in the first half of the day on Saturday.  As the water cleared small pink and white maribou jigs tipped with either maggots or a pinhead shiner destroyed fish.  Many of the takes were breathtaking with the float being ripped under lightning fast.  I have a huge number of pic's but I'll just post a few, all the fish look the same anyway.            Mixed in with the small chromers were a few larger specimens.  This clean looking buck smashed my jig and put up a heckuva tussle:    Also caught a handful of fat old egg wagons loaded with loose roe.  This one wallowed around like an old sow when I stuck her.    Yesterday before we left for home we decided to keep a few of the small chromers to eat. There's not much better table fare imo (well, maybe brook tout  ).     All in all a truly outstanding trip.  There's a few board members who should have been there (Brian, Phil, Craig...  )  Next time boys. Things will be real interesting from here on in, lots more opportunities in the next month or so.   Cheers,  Mike"
561593,ADB,2011-03-14 12:50:00,444,"Great report, Mike.  I need to drag myself out for some of those."
561594,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-14 12:52:00,2050,"BUDDY! I walked into my office this morning and opened the window which faces east...enjoyed a wicked sunrise to the first sounds of singing birds.... then topped it off with my first Solo report of the season.  That's right...Spring is here for me!   :thumbsup_anim:  Thanks dude! Light 'em up this season!  Cheers, Ryan"
561595,BillM,2011-03-14 12:55:00,17367,"An absolute blast Mike, great way to start the season   I could only chuckle after hearing a few locals say the river was unfishable, lol."
561599,johnnyb,2011-03-14 13:11:00,3413,Very impressive....love the shots of the fish with the ice floes in the background.  Can I sign up for a centrepin lesson soon?
561600,solopaddler,2011-03-14 13:23:00,8605," If you have time this spring and want to get out, just ask.    Anytime bud."
561606,craigdritchie,2011-03-14 13:36:00,1586,"Sweet. Nice pics.  Should have been there, I know, but in the end I made some major brownie points at home and got ahead on some work. To the point I've just booked an ""offsite meeting"" for tomorrow with a client named Mr. Steel.  Must remember sunscreen."
561607,solopaddler,2011-03-14 13:41:00,8605," Brownie points are always good.  I think you picked a good day. The entire week looks fantastic actually with the warm temps.  I'm working the Sportsmans Show this week.   (Not really complaing, it'll be fun.  )"
561613,bicephalic,2011-03-14 13:52:00,112,Very nice!  Always nice to keep a few eaters too -  Good job
561619,EC1,2011-03-14 14:12:00,930,"Awesome day out there! I didn't get a single 2010 steelhead, so I am looking to maybe get one this year!"
561626,troutologist,2011-03-14 14:27:00,951,"So I was just barely getting through with an extension on the auger yesterday, it was in the -20 to -30 range all weekend.  This isn't helping!!!  Great fish guys, can't wait for open water!"
561639,Harrison,2011-03-14 15:04:00,2202,"man, sorry we had to miss this Mike.  Great report as usual.  I'll send Paul the link to this report...alittle salt for his stab wounds."
