561864,Grimace,2011-03-15 00:17:00,2020,Found a piece of it.  The one on Facebook is the cameraman's.  There is a cut of it in this video.  The water rushing down the street.  They condense it to a few minutes.  The cameraman.s on facebook is over six minutes.  http://www.youtube.com/user/ANNnewsCH#p/u/85/MfLEKTRToiI
