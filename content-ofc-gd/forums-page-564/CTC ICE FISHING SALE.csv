561358,Wymen,2011-03-13 15:51:00,30,"Saw some of the ""discounted prices"" - they look awfully close to LeBarons every day pricing.  Its one of those holy crap, that's how much margin CTC is making, moments.  B/c you gotta believe that they are still making money on these sales."
560630,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-11 14:51:00,2690,"Not sure if anybody else has mentioned it, but, Canadian Tire does have an ice fishing sale this year.  You can see most of the items that are on sale online. Figured I'd give everyone a heads up."

560739,d_paluch,2011-03-11 19:36:00,343,all tip-ups onsale too. HT thermal ones for 11.99
560823,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-11 23:02:00,390,  They do it at the end of the ice fishing season.  You still have 3 months left.
560824,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-11 23:04:00,10439, They didn't do it last year either.  When they have had it in the past it has been at the same time as down South which was awesome as we could use the new goodies right away.
560838,Leecher,2011-03-11 23:54:00,7832,"On my way home, stopped in to have a look and they had a good variety of stuff at very decent price.... was looking at Hi-Tech Telescopic Ice Skimmers and guess the price    regular $14.99  Yep $8.99  Also was looking at the jigging rods and found a medium action with the large eyelets, the same I have that you've seen in my reports but it didn't have a tag on it and I ask the service guy if he knew the price, looked on the shelf and says to me ""It's yours for $5.00""  I says ""SOLD   ""  Little Foxee's were $3.99 Great deals guys.... hurry up, the stuff is disappearing fast"
560840,misfish,2011-03-11 23:59:00,29133,40% on the crap stuff.Good stuff still over priced.
561305,irishfield,2011-03-13 05:23:00,26272,"I went in Midland today and just about everything is already put away... as I found it was at Princess Auto ""all seasonal items returned to headquarters"".. WTH..  Anyone interested Midland CTC has one Eskimo power auger.. 1.4 HP I believe.. regular $399.. marked down to $299. Imagine you can haggle as it doesn't have a box and is their last one."
561330,Jer,2011-03-13 13:41:00,1426,   ...or wait til next fall and get the 2 HP at Costco for $280.
561333,GBW,2011-03-13 14:12:00,8460,"Stouffville has nothing, Whitby South is under reno and has nothing and Whitby North has done the reno had has very little left.  I did however pick up a new set of auger blades for HH for under $20 after taxes."
561341,danbouck,2011-03-13 14:44:00,4380,"One in Cambridge had a fair bit, I looked at the 4 man pop up hut for about an hour @ $179 but decided to walk away."
561344,Rod Caster,2011-03-13 15:27:00,5784,"Nothing great at CT North Bay... a few decent sales here and there, but no sweeping 40% off.  I suppose they change out their winter products later in the season up north.  They just renovated the inside of the store again, seems like every year they change the view from inside."
