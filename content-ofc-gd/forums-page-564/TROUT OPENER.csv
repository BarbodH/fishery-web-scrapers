559672,soggey,2011-03-09 00:22:00,20,Yep trout opener the 23rd of April. Always was the last saturday in April but they changed the wording of the regs last year. It will only make a difference for this year and next when there is actually 5 saturdays in April.
559749,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 03:19:00,8333,That is also the Easter weekend this year:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=51560

559755,Dara,2011-03-09 03:25:00,3052,  because the regs are never confusing

559818,craigdritchie,2011-03-09 12:27:00,1586,"My bad - didn't know they had changed it.  Doesn't really matter, since the best fishing will be over and done long before then."
559819,Jacob,2011-03-09 12:30:00,186,"thank's, I thought it was the 30th if I didn't read this I would have missed a week of trout fishing  I can't wait"

560249,BillM,2011-03-10 14:44:00,17367,"I dunno where I'll be on opener, but it definitely won't be fishing for steelhead!   Bring on the residents!"
