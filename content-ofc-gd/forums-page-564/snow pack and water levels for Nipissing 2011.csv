Public Works and Government Services Canada has responded by starting to close the dams off five to six weeks earlier than normal.  ""Even though we don't know what will happen in spring with precipitation, we are taking the chance we're not going to have an extremely wet spring,"" said Phil Hall, Lands and Waters Technical Specialist with the Ministry of Natural Resources. ""It's always somewhat of a guessing game as we can't accurately predict long-term weather.""  Reports from the 13 snow stations in the Sturgeon/Nipissing/French River watershed show the snow pack and its water content is much the same as it was this time last year.  And for those who can recall — most people who own a big boat certainly will — Lake Nipissing never did reach its summer navigational level of 195.75 metres above sea level.  ""Last year, the month of March saw zero precipitation, which is very abnormal,"" Hall said.  As of March 1, Lake Nipissing's level was 10 centimetres above the long-term average which is based on 51 years of data.  As well, Lake Nipissing is normally drawn down to 1.3 metres below summer navigational levels by March 15. Not this year. As of Wednesday the lake was 27 centimetres above that level.  The Sturgeon/Nipissing/French River Water Management Group agreed Wednesday to hedge their bets on a dryer than normal spring.  ""However if we start receiving significant precipitation, we will have to rethink our strategy,""Hall said.  Even though there are still two-and-a-half months before Lake Nipissing is to be at summer navigational level, the group only counts on snow to fill 25% of Lake Nipissing, and that is if the snow depth and water content in the area's snow pack is at 100%.  Of the watershed's 13 snow stations, there is only 50% of the normal water content in the snow based on the long term average of normal for this time of year.  Brian Tayler, general manager of the North Bay Mattawa Conservation Authority said snow depth and water content levels varied between North Bay and the outlying areas with below normal levels on Highway 11 and near normal levels in Corbeil.  ""It will be a normal spring run off with these types of numbers if we get additional rain and snow,"" Tayler said. ""What will really tell is what March brings.""  When it comes to Lake Nipissing's summer navigational water levels, the group counts ""on rain, a whole lot more than the snow melt,"" Hall said.  ""The point to make is managing water levels, despite there being dams, is not an exact science because the biggest factor in the equation — rain — is unknown,"" he said.  ""We could have a wet spring, dry spring . . . if anyone knows for sure, give me a call.""  [email protected]"

558114,irishfield,2011-03-04 22:07:00,26272,"Don't hold your breath Lew. Absolutely minimal snow until you get North of North Bay and then when it comes right down to it there was a foot at best in Temagami and the lake is about 3 feet down. Not quite as low as it was last March, but it's close. Hope for a rainy spring."
558150,Grimace,2011-03-04 23:45:00,2020,It is reminding me of last year.  The Frost on the jobsite is thawing on warms days and not coming back on the cold ones.  Gradual and early.     Makes for a manageable jobsite but very little snow in the bush means not much run off in the spring.
561999,Double What??,2011-03-15 14:20:00,29,"Hi all,  FWIW...  I track the water level on Nipissing and I can tell you that it's 10cm higher as of yesterday compared to the same time last year.  So, that's a positive sign.  DW"
562000,Muskieman,2011-03-15 14:32:00,2472,"My Father In Law .. controls the outflow from Sturgeon Falls Dam/Power Plant  and so far so good ..according to Jack they're running at normal levels 330CMM or something like that... with the rain in the forecast for this and next week .. It'll be way different than last year, I hope.  Randy "
562018,Nipfisher,2011-03-15 15:38:00,2449,"I hope so as I require a bit more than 10"" of water for my boat and that is all we had at our docks last year."
