561181,ehg,2011-03-12 22:05:00,2666,Thought about fishing here for last 20 yrs. or so. Thinking this year might try pike or panfish early in season but don't have fishing regulations book and can't download PDF files so don't know if it is FMZ 17 or what. Anyone know? Anyone try fishing there? Looking on Google Earth i can't see any roads on south side. Is there a launch there or do you have to go to north side? Really want to try here if it is easy to launch. Apparently even the odd musky here  Thanks in advance.

It was a hidden gem with great crappie, bass and pike. Fishing presure has pretty much wiped out the panfish and the other gamefish have followed. I keep holding out for a turn around and do 1 trip a year out there. At the end of the day I climb back in the truck and wonder why I keep abusing myself. Great memories of a once incredible stretch of water."

561244,fishindude,2011-03-13 01:07:00,220,"Yep it's FMZ 17, so pike is open all year  I haven't fished it before so I can't offer any advice but I plan to this softwater season in my canoe."
561256,ehg,2011-03-13 01:39:00,2666,Thanks for the replies thus far and PM's. FMZ 17 eh? Pike and panfish all year then. Have to give it a try. Hoping for pike.
561313,lew,2011-03-13 10:22:00,12766," For the most part Eric, the pike are small but like anywhere, they can be aggressive some days. Here's an average sized one that grabbed an  18"" Bull Dawg a couple years back.  As mentioned above though, the fishing there is nothing like it used to be and you'd probably do just as well in your usual places in Lake O off Toronto and save the drive.  "
561339,ehg,2011-03-13 14:35:00,2666,"Like the picture Lew  Getting poor reviews on the pike here was hoping for better. I might still try there one day. Thanks for PM's as well. Cheers, Erik"
561581,Harrison,2011-03-14 11:30:00,2202,"I am echoing Lew. Not like it once was. However, there is still good largemouth but you have to fish the real heavy junk. Half decent pannies too."
561732,pidge,2011-03-14 19:01:00,438,Check this link out http://www.jakescottages.ca/. I do belive it is on Percy reach. I use to go here alot as a kid. Last time was about 3-4 yrs ago. Very nice people and decent fishing.
561878,kingofthesteelhead,2011-03-15 00:47:00,140,Used to fish it about 25 years ago for crappie out of the launch by jake's cottages.Last time I was there a couple of years ago not many crappie.Better choices for panfish on rice and scugog and a heck of a lot closer.Sorry no pike in these lakes.
