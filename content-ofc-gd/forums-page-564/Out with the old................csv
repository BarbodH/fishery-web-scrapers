559828,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 12:59:00,5865, To each his own.....I traded in a Found On Road Dead truck for my Toyota Tundra rice burner and never looked back.....BTW rice is much cheaper now then expensive gasoline....  :rofl2:
559832,blaque,2011-03-09 13:06:00,2419," Aha, down here they just refer to it as an xlt with the ""chrome package""."
559833,Skud,2011-03-09 13:09:00,739, I can't get it too dirty in just the 2nd day of owning it. It hauls four guys and all our tools to work everyday just fine.  I will take another pic in a few weeks when the construction site thaws out. You won't be able to see what colour it is.
559841,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 13:29:00,5865, You mean something like this.... 
559860,corvette1,2011-03-09 14:13:00,1765,sweet ride congrats
559890,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-09 16:02:00,3761,"The Ford F150 today and Ford Superduty have all the numbers, test's, and offer the best out of the gate. Looking forward to driving my older F150 this year...Years down the line I'll look at no other place...only ford vehicles in our family, a 2005 van and a 2011 focus...go Ford!  This video always makes me laugh at the competition......After watching every video(1 through 6) of the ""torture tests it blows my mind how good they are lol...gonna go over to the dealer just so i can sit in 1  "
561803,Abraxus,2011-03-14 22:04:00,104,"  I have a 2010 F150 XTR with the 5.4.  I love it!  This having been said, I test drove the new 2011 EcoBoost 3.5 liter V6 today and HOLY!  That thing would kick the crap out of my truck!  Honestly...you have a hard time keeping the wheels from spinning righ off of it! I am totally impressed and disapointed that purchased my truck before the Eco Boost came out.  It gets phenominal fuel milage where as mine is absolute pig!  I get on average 17liters to the 100k.  The Ecoboost is like 14 in the city and 9 on the Highway.  This all having been said, its the power that blows your mind!  It really really really pulls!  I just could not believe the difference in torgue and throttle repsonse between my 5.4 and this 3.5! The ecoboost would literally leave us guys with teh V8's standing still!  AB"
559386,Skud,2011-03-08 03:00:00,739,She served me well.      But I like the new one better.    Ford sure made a crap load of improvements in just three years. I have three trips up north and one down south this year and I going to enjoy every km of them.
559387,Nipfisher,2011-03-08 03:02:00,2449,Nice truck. I'm a Ford guy 100%.
559391,solopaddler,2011-03-08 03:07:00,8605,Sweet ride Doug!
559392,mercman,2011-03-08 03:09:00,7054,FORD TOUGH !!! Nice Truck. Picked up a Ranger sport XLT last year.Love Ford Trucks !!! Drive carefully !!!!  Paul
559393,BUSTER,2011-03-08 03:14:00,1336,Nice rig..   Pray for gas price to remain low.
559395,BillM,2011-03-08 03:21:00,17367,"Doug, I hope you got the EcoBoost in that bad boy!"
559401,irishfield,2011-03-08 03:43:00,26272,"Nice Doug !!! Just like mine, only mine is platinum/gray.  Those saying you'd better hope the price of gas stays down.. well my 5.0 litre 2011 gets better milage than my 2003 x 4.6 litre got, especially towing.  Drove from Penetang to Toronto Sunday night (@ 118km/hr) on 11.2 l/100km  Wait 'till you tow with it and see all the neat things it does. If you didn't already... and tow anything with electric brakes.. blow the $469 installed and get the factory controller that goes in that hole in the dash below the 2h/4h/4l selector."
559403,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-08 03:51:00,3761,"I would get the same....correct brand, size, and well got to love the black.  Nice Truck, wanna donate ur old one"
559415,ranksda58,2011-03-08 04:25:00,69,"beauty truck! i love the black it looks real slick...ford makes an amazing pickup im a ford guy through and through my first truck was a ranger edge 4.0lV6...unfortunately, got in a pretty bad wreck with her and she succumbed to her wounds at the scene was able to pick up a nice great SUV in the explorer, 4.0lV8, 4x4, love it...tons of room and great for the growing family"
559417,Skud,2011-03-08 04:31:00,739,"Didn't get the Ecoboost, they are selling faster then Ford can make them. I have the 5.0 like Wayne. The gas mileage is almost par on those two engines anyway. Already have the electronic brake controller too. My lease was up so I had to move on a truck . The one I bought had all the toys I wanted minus the larger tow mirrors. Will be keeping this one for a long time."
559418,irishfield,2011-03-08 04:34:00,26272,I wanted the pull out mirrors too Doug. Found the ones on the truck aren't 100% but better than the stocks on my '03 by a landslide. Will probably still buy extensions but will see how the view is with the boat on. The enclosed trailer's the worst and like I said it wasn't that bad for view ripping up to Temagami and back last week.  Remember to do a power turn in the snow... you have to reach up and tap that traction control off button!
559435,tb4me,2011-03-08 06:20:00,3295,I was thinking I want one of these ford trucks..Sweet looking rides. Seen one here in Brantford lastweek..  http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=33186
559447,Rich Clemens,2011-03-08 10:33:00,3131,Sweet ride.  We got a new F-150 a couple years ago and love it.   Even my wife likes driving it.  Pulls our boat with ease and better gas mileage than the old Dakota we had.  The newer models are getting a bit better gas mileage than the 2009 we have.  Time for an upgrade ?  (I don't think she'll go for that yet)
559448,misfish,2011-03-08 10:51:00,29133,Very nice Doug.
559505,Dara,2011-03-08 14:46:00,3052,I'm driving a Toyota tundra right now and can't wait for the lease to be up so I can get back into a Ford
559507,Leecher,2011-03-08 14:49:00,7832,Sweet ride Doug    Congrats
559541,bigbuck,2011-03-08 16:31:00,2449,"Nice!! I think my next vehicle is gonna be a Ford pickup. Dunno if I'm going to go SuperDuty or F150, time will tell when the time gets closer."
559551,Skud,2011-03-08 17:31:00,739,"The truck is in today getting a diamond coat, Scotchgaurd and the front windows tinted. Got to take care of it before construction season kicks in and the abuse starts."
559564,FUSION,2011-03-08 18:25:00,81,"Sweet Truck, Loving my new 2011 with the new engine."
559607,blaque,2011-03-08 21:01:00,2419,"I also have the same truck in white except i got the ATS tire (just a little beefier) Im not sure what the XTR model is? Haven seen that down in the states  Love it, its my third in a row"
559638,Skud,2011-03-08 23:28:00,739,"The XTR has the larger tires with chrome rims and the running boards. It has more chrome on the truck over all. This is my 4th truck in a row and my wife is on her 3rd ford now(Explorer,Freestar,Expedition). Fords work for me."
559646,lew,2011-03-08 23:51:00,12766,"Good looking truck Doug, I've got a 2010 with the XTR package.....EXCELLENT vehicles !!"
559726,BillM,2011-03-09 02:27:00,17367," Billy Bobs head just exploded, lol!!!!"
559781,perchslayer666,2011-03-09 04:23:00,280,"Truck looks pretty clean, I bet shes great for hauling groceries."
559815,fish_fishburn,2011-03-09 12:14:00,1311,Ford trucks are the best. Enough said.
