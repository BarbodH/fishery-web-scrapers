561381,Bernie,2011-03-13 17:17:00,3190,Glad to see you out fishing Mike! Nice fish
561382,wallacio,2011-03-13 17:21:00,475,Nice going Mike!  Here's hoping that round 2 isn't necessary and you'll be able to put that new reel into action with some spring Steel!
561478,BillM,2011-03-13 23:01:00,17367,Good to hear Mike!!
561481,Jewelbee,2011-03-13 23:24:00,422,Nice goin!!!!
561556,ctranter,2011-03-14 02:39:00,543,Looks like you did better on the hard water than I did Mike!  Good to hear and thanks for the update.
561571,limeyangler,2011-03-14 09:58:00,5204,WTG Mike!  Nice fish.
561574,Cudz,2011-03-14 10:22:00,2652,congrats on everything.  Never underestimate how fast lakers can swim when they want to.
561579,solopaddler,2011-03-14 10:56:00,8605,"The smile on your face holding that laker says it all.  Very decent fish indeed!  Gotta love Tom's reels, the float reel equivolent of a Swiss watch.  If you need any help de-virginizing it, drop me a line."
561583,Harrison,2011-03-14 11:39:00,2202,Awesome bud. Maybe we'll see ya bouncing around the tribs out east.  I'll look for the reel. Phil
561609,craigdritchie,2011-03-14 13:44:00,1586,"Nice greaser, Mike! Always liked catching those guys through the ice.  Shoot me a note when you're ready to get some fish slime on the new wheel :-)"
561700,tibbs,2011-03-14 18:09:00,650,Great Report MJL!  Awesome laker dude! I've got to catch one myself one day.  
560847,MJL,2011-03-12 00:18:00,2427,"The last little while I was mostly out of commission.  Chemo hit me a lot harder than I imagined for longer than I hoped.  I missed out on the Fishing for Tyler event and some fun OFC g2g’s on the ice  .  I can’t imagine how the patients who go through multiple sessions on a regular basis feel.  In a nutshell it sucked having every side-effect on the list they gave me except for hair loss...But I lived through the 1 session and I have the whole month of March away from hospitals, needles and CT scans (which I probably hate the most).  I go back to Sunnybrook in April to see if I’ll need round 2.  With only a couple weeks left in the season for Simcoe lakers, I just HAD to get out for at least 1 decent laker this past weekend. Lake trout for the past 2 years on Simcoe haven’t been very kind to me.  Watching them zoom up from 95ft to meet your falling lure 30ft below the ice, and turn back down to the bottom, is probably the ultimate form of rejection an angler can get .  This season wasn’t that different with only 2 ciscos to show for my efforts in January.  I caught my last decent lake trout (bigger than a cigar) on March 6th 2010  Sunday March 6, 2011 and feeling OK, Victor and Frozen-Fire took me out for some ice fishing  . At 9am it almost happened...I see a fish rocket up 15ft from the bottom to meet my tube and I connect with it.  For a minute I slowly try to bring it to the surface...Then the hook popped out  9:37am the ice Gods must have been generous because it happened.  I see a fish rocket up off bottom in 90ft of water to meet my tube at 75ft. I engage the reel and crank it fast.  The fish chased it another 20ft before it slammed it. It’s amazing to see how fast lake trout can swim after food. The fish took 3 mega long runs back down to the bottom but I finally got it through the hole    I can only think of a few other fish I’ve caught in my life where I’ve felt as happy and relieved to catch...This ice season, I didn't totally suck  I might do one more trip out onto the ice this weekend.  Plans haven’t been made as of yet.  Perhaps I’m not as sad anymore to see ice season end. Along with that fish, after 4 months of waiting, my new toy finally arrived.  I guess you can say my baby (left) has a new big sister (right)    Just gotta decide where to Christen her and what new rod she’ll be paired up with for my future river adventures.  Can't wait!  Cheers and all smiles  Mike"
560850,kemper,2011-03-12 00:22:00,2232,"Cheers Mike,  Let me know if you want to get out, we're due for one"

560864,daryl0815,2011-03-12 00:48:00,225,"Good to hear you are doing well man, I cant imagine how tough that treatment must be.  Well done on the Laker, I have yet to catch a Laker through the ice, I haven't even been out for them this year, I want to get out one more time on Simcoe to try and get one, and time is running out!"
560868,Gregoire,2011-03-12 00:53:00,1397,Thanks for sharing. I am hoping that the ice will hold up for the weekend so I can get a shot at my first laker through the ice this weekend.
560869,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-12 00:53:00,2050,"buddy we haven't had a tuesday night chat in a while! Take care of yourself and please keep in touch when you can! Nothing but the best from myself and the family!  Cheers, Ryan"

561004,ChrisK,2011-03-12 13:25:00,2772,Right on Mike !! I have yet to land a Simcoe Laker or a Whitie for that matter but it hasn't been for the lack of trying. I just need someone knowledgeable enough to show me how its done
561040,spinnerdoc,2011-03-12 14:55:00,556,that's a beauty laker dude and the reels look awesome mike....i'm sure you'll make good use of it. cheers  edwin
561055,l2p,2011-03-12 15:34:00,346,Good to see a post from you Mike! See you out on the rivers soon!
561105,Spiel,2011-03-12 17:44:00,9065,"That's all just fine and dandy Mike but when are we gonna get out fishing together? And I hope it's this year. Perhaps some open water Simcoe whities would be in order, my boat, my treat.  Not to undermine your post of course, I'm very happy to see your doing well and getting out, chin up my friend, we'll get 'er done."
561359,MJL,2011-03-13 15:55:00,2427,"Thanks guys...Really means a lot  I managed to end my season on Simcoe yesterday with 1 more smaller laker   I guess the Karma for pushing a guy's broken down car at 4am yesterday to the nearest gas station helped   There's still 1 more on the way...   Chris, that's an offer that no angler in their right mind would refuse  Can't wait!  Mike"
561378,corvette1,2011-03-13 17:06:00,1765,nice laker congrats
