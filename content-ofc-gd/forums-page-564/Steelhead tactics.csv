561688,fishin jesus,2011-03-14 17:55:00,53,"Good day gang  i'm thinking of hitting a trib on the upcoming weekend.  this time of year should i be floating roe or should i be floating some Berkley Power minnows  ??. any advice on how to fish the mouths at this time of year????  float, toss hardware, bottom bounce???"
561690,Spiel,2011-03-14 17:57:00,9065,"Take it all and use it all, something is bound to work."
561705,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-14 18:14:00,0,"i'm more inclined to chuck hardware early am, and shortly before dark...  the rest is all trial and error and taking close observation of where and what worked."
561708,fishin jesus,2011-03-14 18:18:00,53,"that makes sense......i'm always self doubting myself as to what to put under the float at diff times of the year. Pink worms, power grubs, or roe....but you right.......bring em' all !!  What about running a fly under the float?....wolly bugger, or egg suckin' Leech , Stone Fly???"
561712,chessy,2011-03-14 18:29:00,610,take it all and try it .. and if people are getting fish try to look to see what they are using
561719,fish_finder,2011-03-14 18:38:00,370,Little black stones will be hatching and very active in most rivers right now.  Sizes 12-14 would be best bets if the water is clear enough.  Up size those if the water is dirty.
561720,Roy,2011-03-14 18:39:00,13728,"Bring a boat. In spite of what people might have told you, you CANNOT walk on water."
561722,Homer Is King,2011-03-14 18:42:00,305,"Great top FJ!  I was thinking the same thing.  I was out on Duffins today at noon.  Used a pink hair jig, bobbom bouncing.  No luck.  I know it's a bad time of day but it's the only time I could get out.  Next time I'll float some roe."

561774,fishin jesus,2011-03-14 20:54:00,53,That's a great idea.....I have  a few Black Stone Flies on the larger size.......thanks for the advice !

562036,Gregoire,2011-03-15 16:54:00,1397, That reminded me a Seinfeld Episode: The ocean callede...they're all out of shrimp Yeah well the jerkstore called...they're all out of you That's suprising because I hear you're the all time best seller Yeah....well...I has sex with your wife   I'll let you decide where you fit in to that discussion. (It has something to do with being funny and not being funny)
562048,fishrking,2011-03-15 17:17:00,24,There's a reason steelheaders wear vests.  I likely have 20 pounds of gear stowed away in mine with everything from small hair jigs to spinners to plastics - they all have their time and place.
562053,fishin jesus,2011-03-15 17:25:00,53,"thanks guys  i was beginning to get lazy..........i just went and dug up alot of my gear.  fly boxes,Roe,Pink work, emerald shiner power baits............ALL packed into the vest !!  it now weighs 45 pounds but if i get into the fish it;s all worth it !! LOL    i'm usually a fly guy...i'm branching out this season !!   "
562069,Mike Pike,2011-03-15 18:19:00,1332,"Yup, I have the same problem.  I always pack my vest with so many tackle options that within an hour or two my neck and shoulders start to get soar with all the weight!  Problem is, you never know what will be working this time of year so you want it all.  Spoons, roe, gulp minnows, jigs, etc.  Guess I'd rather be weighed down with a full fishing vest than find out buddy has a particular bait that's working and I didn't have it packed!"
562077,johnnyb,2011-03-15 19:15:00,3413,"Better yet, bring a backpack....you can carry more stuff and just put it down when you start to fish"
