Had afew snap offs and bite offs but a great day none the less.    Got out again saturday with the ole' man for some jumbos and did alright, the bite was slow but managed 5 between 1 lb 2oz-1 lb 5oz  all 14-14.5 inches. and of course a few of the usual little culprits maybe a dozen between 8-12 inches    "
