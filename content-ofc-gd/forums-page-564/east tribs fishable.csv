561518,Dozer,2011-03-14 01:06:00,896,"Ehhh, at least he doens't  have 1 post expecting to get answers... but yeah, go find out yourself or move closer!  My guess is that they're blown."
561520,Marko,2011-03-14 01:09:00,854,lol i actually thought twice about asking.
561521,BillM,2011-03-14 01:10:00,17367, lol!  I think the consensus is that they aren't in very good shape right now
561525,chessy,2011-03-14 01:15:00,610,ganaraska river is high but fishable . they caught some fish today but not in great numbers.  if your on facebook check out ganaraskafishway    for reports of fishing and how far along is the rainbow run

561549,Marko,2011-03-14 02:22:00,854,"Alright, Thank you guys for replying. Maybe I`ll save the gas and go next weekend instead."
