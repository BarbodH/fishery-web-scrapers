I've searched some previous posts about this and came up with Aikmans in Mississauga.  Just was wondering if anybody knew an approximate price range to get this done, and time frame. Will i have to drop off my reel and pick up another day? or is same day service available? (trying to save 2 trips down there)  Or if somebody can recommend another spot to get this done im all ears. Live in Caledon, work in Richmond Hill  My reel is a Quantum Energy E761PT"
561502,bpsbassman,2011-03-14 00:24:00,941,That's about the only guy that still does it.  I would give him a call and get him to give you an estimate on time.
561516,msp,2011-03-14 01:05:00,1336,I have heard mixed reviews about Aikmans. I have had over 6 reels fixed and serviced as well as a trolling motor seviced there. Great service and my reels are as good as new. You wil not get one day service. It usually takes about 1-2 weeks. Approx. price will be about $20- $30.
