560256,coreyhkh,2011-03-10 15:24:00,163,I would just like to know when they start moving into the river.

560548,HTHM,2011-03-11 04:11:00,4082,Wait till the water temp is at least 40 F
560567,Live2fish85,2011-03-11 07:20:00,1633,Where I go I just wait until the ice is out and then start fishing and always do good.
560982,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-12 07:44:00,1107,They will come in pretty early I have missed them 2 years in a row waiting to long as soon as the rivers calm down give it a shot I hear the river is better than the channel from a couple locals I spoke with last year.
561349,Marko,2011-03-13 15:36:00,854,Do you guys fish for them right at the mouth??
561373,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-13 16:36:00,1107,  Corner holes in the river seem to be the best from what I have been told for catfish creek I have only fished the channel with only a couple small cats to show for it .
