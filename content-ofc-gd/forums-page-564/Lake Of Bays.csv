561479,tb4me,2011-03-13 23:02:00,3295,"I was up past there yesterday.. lots of ice (from what I heard) and lots of water. Take from that what you will,,I wasnt out there just looking from shore."
561558,wallacio,2011-03-14 02:45:00,475,"Yep, I was up recently but it was the beginning of the the week before the thaw.   At the time there was lots of ice (18"" or so) and close to a foot of snow on top.   At this point, I imagine it's pretty sloppy...ie a fair amount of water and slush."
561603,johnnyb,2011-03-14 13:31:00,3413,"I was on Lake Muskoka yesterday, and there was tons of ice....little bit of a crust on top from all the water...but easy walking and a solid 18"" of ice."
