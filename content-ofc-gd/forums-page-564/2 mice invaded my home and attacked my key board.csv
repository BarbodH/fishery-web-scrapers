Its been years since ive done it, and I dont think I missed a step. The ones I made back then were terrible, being a rookie and all These seem to be a step up and in rough form so far. Eyes to added and some more clipping as well.  Anyhoo, for you fly tiers out there. What do you think? If a fish follows them, then Im happy as can be!  "

561439,spincast,2011-03-13 21:04:00,3279,"Nice job Vince -- bucket mouths at LPB would probably find those pretty enticing too (hint.. hint) BTW - BPS had some moose mane and a bunch of synthetics, but I didnt see any yak hairs - of course with all those people standing looking it was hard to get a good look - but the moose mane looked like it should do the trick pretty good"
