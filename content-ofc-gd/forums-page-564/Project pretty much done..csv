561908,Flappn,2011-03-15 01:38:00,245,speechless. Awesome job!
560552,Bernie,2011-03-11 04:30:00,3190," Thank you Rattletrap.   Thank you Wayne. Started on the 18 I got from the auction last summer. Gave it new coils, points and a water pump. It's in real good condition and is going to be a beauty. A customer came in the shop, seen it and said he has one just like it, electric start too. I'm going to try to get it and put the pair on a new cedar for next year. It's just a beginning plan for now, hope it works out."
560568,Live2fish85,2011-03-11 07:25:00,1633,That's an awesome job on that. You sure got some skill to make that look like it does.
560599,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 12:46:00,5865,"Excellent job to be proud of.....  :clapping:  Makes me laugh...as I took my 1985 motor in last week my dealer told me, you know Bob this is a OLD motor...he was more interested in selling me a new one then repairing my OLD one....but I said ""Fran it still runs great""...old my     I though as I walked back to my truck..."
560609,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-11 13:38:00,390,Nicely done on the new paint and decals.  Did you do anything mechanically to the motor because of course those things leak more fluid then my Depends do after 14 hours on the slot machine.
560614,Leecher,2011-03-11 13:48:00,7832,"You got mad skills Bernie I'm no mechanic but appreciate the hard work you put into it.... take a bow, you deserve it Leechman"
560622,Roy,2011-03-11 14:25:00,13728,"A true work of art, Bernie. It looks and I'm sure IS, priceless!   You probably don't know Bernie but that whole Giesler family are artisans."
560624,Grimace,2011-03-11 14:30:00,2020,Wow that is great.  I would certainly assume that you have that engine running as tight as the paint job looks.  That is fantastic.  Show us the 18 when your done.  I love this type of thing.  Cheers
560632,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-11 14:53:00,2582,Love seeing when a true craftsman shows off his work...especially when it comes to restoring old things to new condition.  Thx for sharing with us Bernie...you sir ARE a true craftsman.
560637,Headhunter,2011-03-11 14:56:00,5703,Nice job Bernie... all it needs now is a nice shiny stainless prop and you are ready to hit the lake! HH
560683,Bernie,2011-03-11 16:56:00,3190,"Thank you folks.  This little engine will not be used, just for display purposes. It does run, the engine is tight with good compression, mag plate is tight, lower unit holds pressure, shifts well. It has had very little use over its life. Mostly shuffled around in garages and basements. But I did not replace ignition parts, or carb overhaul. But if the need ever arose it could easily be done.  My next one (the 18HP) is getting the full treatment as it will be mounted on a boat this summer."
561050,skinny,2011-03-12 15:22:00,442,I have an old gale 12 that could be restored if your looking for another project this one could come resonable (I think)
561075,Tybo,2011-03-12 16:40:00,1373,"Very slick,Bernie"
561078,Bernie,2011-03-12 16:48:00,3190," Thank you for the offer Skinny. While it is a product made by OMC, my focus will be on Johnson/Evinrudes.   Thank you Paul."
561308,pidge,2011-03-13 06:21:00,438,"very nice Bernie. I was upset they didnt have the antiques at the spring fishing/boat show this year, I enjoy looking at them old motors. Once again"
561338,Jds63,2011-03-13 14:32:00,1365,Beautiful job !
561393,Handlebarz,2011-03-13 17:49:00,3790,Dang that sure is looking nice Bernie it would be nice to have the time and skill to do that stuff.
561443,Bernie,2011-03-13 21:10:00,3190," Thank you Pidge. I didn't make it to the show this year. I don't know why they were not at the show, usually there are a few there.   Thank you JDS   Time is the factor Mike. Other than a LOT of elbow grease with lots of sanding, priming and sanding again plus attention to detail it goes pretty easy. A little practice with the spray paint helps."
561452,misfish,2011-03-13 21:26:00,29133,"All I can say Bernie is,,,,,,,,,,well,,,, Im speachless.Truely a piece of art.    They were there. I kenw I should of taken pics of them. They were in the walk way to the second hall of the show. There was even a hand crank motor,well I guess it wasnt a motor if you had to hand crank to make the prop to go."
561485,Bernie,2011-03-13 23:35:00,3190,"Thank you Brian. They were probably one of the best looking outboards made, so it makes it easier to make it look nice."
561494,aplumma,2011-03-14 00:03:00,6896,Real nice project Bernie it rivals all of the other ones you have shared with us in the past.  Art
561501,bpsbassman,2011-03-14 00:22:00,941,Amazing job Bernie!! That looks awesome!  Brings back a few memories.
561506,Rattletrap2,2011-03-14 00:45:00,1652," No, The antique motors were indeed there, but they were in a walkway between two buildings."
561825,pidge,2011-03-14 22:51:00,438,"Oh my bad, I wish I would have seen it. How the heck did I miss it?? Next year maybe."
561831,CCMAR,2011-03-14 23:01:00,11,impressive. I like the color scheme too  
561907,Bernie,2011-03-15 01:33:00,3190," Thank you Art. I hope that each one gets better than the last. I was talking to my paint and decal supplier this evening and picked up a few more tips.   Yes Roger, many memories for me too. I'm the little guy sitting in the boat about 1960.   Thank you CCMAR. Yep, painted just the way it was when made in 1958."
560393,Bernie,2011-03-10 21:47:00,3190,I posted a couple pics in a recent thread of the 5 1/2 Johnson fixup. Here is a pic story on it. Waiting on the gold badge for the front then done. Working on the next one now. An 18 that Wayne gave me a heads up on last summer.          
560394,BFSC Kevin,2011-03-10 21:48:00,1351,Amazing job Bernie!
560396,Banger68,2011-03-10 21:55:00,157,How did you get all the replacement labels and decals? Looks real good.
560400,vance,2011-03-10 22:07:00,719,Thats a real beauty.When I am up that way next summer I will have to get Ross Stack to take me to your shop so I can have a better look.  vance
560402,Bernie,2011-03-10 22:12:00,3190,"Thanks fellas.  Banger, the decals are available on-line My link  Hey Vance, you know Ross? Good fellow and he is in here often, sometimes just to say hello."
560405,Sandbag,2011-03-10 22:26:00,533,Beautiful job Bernie.  Is that a Giesler that you have her mounted on there>  Cheers  Craig
560406,lew,2011-03-10 22:26:00,12766,"Incredible restoration Bernie, really nice !!  My uncle bought a new 35 HP Seahorse in the same colour scheme but I don't recall the year but I'm thinking early 60's ??"
560409,Bernie,2011-03-10 22:37:00,3190,"Hi Lew, if it was the same colour it would be a 1958. The 57's were same colours but reversed on the hood. 56's were solid colour and a little darker. 59's were white."
560411,Daplumma,2011-03-10 22:39:00,1961,Very cool Bernie.I have got to get by your shop this summer. Joe
560413,TJQ,2011-03-10 22:44:00,7806,Very nice Bernie!!
560414,Spiel,2011-03-10 22:45:00,9065,"I always knew you were more than a pretty face I mean an exceptional host, honoured friend and talented individual Bernie, way cool!  I'll bet it runs too...."
560417,Dozer,2011-03-10 22:49:00,896,"Great restore!  Looks very clean and professional   Looks like it just came outta the original box, and nice wooden boat to compliment the motor, see ya on the water"
560427,Bernie,2011-03-10 23:41:00,3190,"I'd be glad to have you stop in Joe!  Thanks TJ !  Thank you for the kind words Chris. Yes, it runs, although I did not do carb or ignition improvements. The block is in great shape with good compression, the lower end holds pressure and the magneto is tight indicating very little running over it's life. This one is destined for display. But my criteria is it needs to be able to be fully done if need be. My next one is getting the full treatment as I will be using it.   Thanks Dozer! Yes, hopefully we will see you on the water."
560429,ranksda58,2011-03-10 23:58:00,69,wow that looks great!
560437,mercman,2011-03-11 00:15:00,7054,What a clasic motor !!!  You are a true crafstman Bernie. I would LOVE to see a picture of that cedar strip boat its on Please
560438,Bernie,2011-03-11 00:16:00,3190," Hi Craig, sorry I missed the reply to you. Yes that is a new one. It's on a dory that they build for the Toronto Harbour."
560439,Bernie,2011-03-11 00:18:00,3190,"Thank you Ranksda.  Merc, Thank you. I'll take a shot of it for you tomorrow."
560493,Rod Caster,2011-03-11 02:07:00,5784,as the others said...VERY nice piece
560499,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-11 02:21:00,4399,Very nice job on the resto Bernie!!!
560503,NAW,2011-03-11 02:39:00,4022,That's areally fine job there Bernie.. Very cool!
560511,Bernie,2011-03-11 02:50:00,3190,"   Thanks fellas. It did turn out OK, I'm pleased with the result."
560519,ChrisK,2011-03-11 02:58:00,2772,Nice job Bernie. Theres just something magic about those older outboards when you put them together with a Giesler cedar strip. I would fish out of a boat like that over most newer ones. I think its like being in a time machine
560524,Bernie,2011-03-11 03:07:00,3190,"Thank you Chris. Time machine, yes, it is for me too. I grew up using these nice little engines on the back of a cedar boat. They run so smooth and were so well made. I have a soft heart for them."
560526,Rattletrap2,2011-03-11 03:10:00,1652,Craftsmanship at its finest Bernie!  Very nicely done!
560546,irishfield,2011-03-11 03:59:00,26272,Great stuff my friend!!!
