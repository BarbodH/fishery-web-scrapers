Somehow, I managed to make it up the stairs to the cathedral and into the building, where I crashed from pew to pew. I finally made my way to a side aisle and into a confessional. A priest had been observed my sorry progress. Figuring I was in need of some assistance, he proceeded to enter his side of the confessional. His attention was rewarded only by a lengthy silence. Finally he asked, ""May I help you, my son?"" ""I dunno."" I said from behind the partition. ""You got any toilet paper on your side?"""
