259429,brifishrgy,2008-10-17 21:59:00,559,headed down to the grand this morning ... was a tough bite .. a few guys managed a few eyes  .. I lost a bow that decided it wanted my jig .. funniest thing I have ever seen at the dam .. a couple guys show up .. not there 2 minutes one guy spots a tail moving on top of the water .. he slowly creeps up to the edge of water with net in hand .. scoop ... he got it .. his exitement turned to shock when he realized it was on someones stringer .. what are these people thinking .. they were obviously there to net the trout jumping the dam .. net with a 8' handle .. his friend later asks if he is allowed to net fish .. I told him he would be in big dodo if he did(if not from the ministry the other fisherman around would probably have something to say about it).. if someone netted my fish on a stringer I think that net would be at the bottom of the river and (we will stop there)  ... hopefully back down next week

259452,timmeh,2008-10-17 23:47:00,609,I used to do some 24 hour water sampling at that dam in dunnville and I certainly met some interesting people there and saw more than a few questionable fishing tactics. That net story is funny tho.
