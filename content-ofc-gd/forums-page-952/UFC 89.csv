259551,misfish,2008-10-18 19:16:00,29133,My picks are in bold  Chris Leben (186) vs. Michael Bisping (185) Would not be surprised if he lost though. Both men have much to prove. Brandon Vera (203) vs. Keith Jardine (205) Jardine I like his kicking power Luis Arthur Cane (206) vs. Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou (205) Good all around fighter is Soko  The rest going by thier reports  Chris Lytle (170) vs. Paul Taylor (170) Marcus Davis (169) vs. Paul Kelly (169) Akihiro Gono (171) vs. Dan Hardy (169) Neil Wain (254) vs. Shane Carwin (264) David Bielkheden (156) vs. Jess Liaudin (155) Sam Stout (155) vs. Terry Etim (155) Jim Miller (155) vs. David Baron (155) Per Eklund (156) vs. Samy Schiavo (156)

259553,BillM,2008-10-18 19:39:00,17367,A few MGD's and the fight is going to be a good way to spend the night

259560,danbo,2008-10-18 20:07:00,2646,"bisping,vera,stout.. the rest is filler"
259565,BUSTER,2008-10-18 20:15:00,1336,AGREE
259571,Jigger,2008-10-18 20:45:00,1237,"I think Vera/Jardine can be either fight of the night or a real snoozefest. Either way both guys can do the other in a few different ways. Both guys just have to push forward to make it a good fight. I'm going with the Dean of Mean on this one. I think I'm rooting for Bisping, but I have a feeling Leben will crack him with a left hammer and expose Bispings chin. I'm glad this card is free either way."
259573,Jigger,2008-10-18 20:50:00,1237,"Results so far, some good picks, Steve.  http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/hardy...at-ufc-89-14838"

259584,danbo,2008-10-18 21:59:00,2646,Dang! Chris Leben can really take a shot..a true Warrior even in defeat!
259587,misfish,2008-10-18 22:16:00,29133,"All those fights made me say HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Nothing really impressive,even when Leben gave free shots and the dumb   was still willing. I really did not see to much heart.Even after all the trash talk. Im thinking there will be better fights downtown tonight.  Nice picks Steve."
259598,Rob,2008-10-18 22:38:00,467,"Next weekend will be good Patrick is hopefully going to beat Anderson Silva. But man that guy can really lay a beating!  Leben, Vera, Stout!"
259608,Cudz,2008-10-18 23:16:00,2652,Damn!  This was a spoiler.  I am watching it at 9 on spike so I won't look at this thread again. lol
259609,Cudz,2008-10-18 23:17:00,2652,"Silva is on his game.  The only way Cote is going to beat him is with a lucky punch.  It can happen (serra vs GSP), but not very likely."
259644,steverowbotham,2008-10-19 01:55:00,1800,Taylor vs. Lytle was a war!  Gotta love it!
259692,danbo,2008-10-19 13:00:00,2646,Cote couldn't beat Silva even with a machete!
259693,Cudz,2008-10-19 13:03:00,2652,Good fight. Davis vs Kelly wasn't bad either. The card was not bad at all.  Would have liked to see Stout's fight though
259727,BillM,2008-10-19 15:12:00,17367,"Lytle always gasses though.  Every single fight I've seen him in..  Cote is going to have his hands full..  I really want the Canadian boy to win, but Silva has been untouchable.  I'd really like to see Silva + GSP"
259748,BUSTER,2008-10-19 16:30:00,1336,boy i was wrong
