259462,cowanjo,2008-10-18 00:42:00,249,"HI i am new to Canada (australian) - love fishing in Pigeon and Big Bald, caught lots of Bass - now I am focusing on Musky for Zero. Any Ideas - what lure and how to troll, cast for these from all you would be awesome, beers on my deck for the best tip when I catch One!.  Help needed thankyou"
259471,Joey,2008-10-18 02:07:00,9122,"Try casting some bucktails or Believers near weed edges.  If I'm not mistaken, Pigeon is kind of weedy so might be a bit hard to troll in.  Haven't fished there much so not very knowledgeable on that lake, sorry.  Joey"
259475,Greencoachdog,2008-10-18 02:18:00,8163,"If the lake is weedy like Joey says, try casting a Slopmaster Spinnerbait in the 06 color. Starting your retrieve as soon as the lure hits the water, around and through the weeds!"
259491,Sinker,2008-10-18 03:51:00,8692,"Yep, spinnerbaits along the weed edges. Black/orange is my go to colour.  Sinker"
259492,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-18 03:59:00,10439,I used to catch a lot of muskyies in Little Bald trolling tandam blade 1/2 oz spinnerbaits in blue and yellow right through the weed beds. The channel between Big and Little Bald has produced a lot of fish casting spinnerbaits to the shore and retrieving to the channel and letting it fall down the face of the weeds.

Find.....  - big flat rocks near the surface (where muskies sun themselves) - rock points etc. adjacent to deep water - open water with schools of baitfish  Troll believers, and or throw big jerkbaits and glidebaits."
