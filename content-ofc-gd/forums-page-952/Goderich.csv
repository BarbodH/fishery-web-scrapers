259642,aws,2008-10-19 01:43:00,53,Heading to Goderich tomorrow for my first time rainbow fishing.  Any hints?
259755,Canuck2fan,2008-10-19 17:11:00,1444,If it is like Nine Mile the biggest hint is save the gas and stay home LOL
259756,BillM,2008-10-19 17:17:00,17367,  LOL!!!!!!   I hung out with a nice guy down at the Notty yesterday for 20mins or so..  Nothing at all...  BRING THE RAIN!
259768,Canuck2fan,2008-10-19 18:27:00,1444,2 fish in total caught on the Nine mile from 5AM until 11 when I gave it up... But there were only like 50 anglers so it was a good ratio LOL
259770,dobee,2008-10-19 18:46:00,301,"was at the maitland all weekend   saw atleast 7 bows caught, not alot of fish in yet"
259784,chickenhawk,2008-10-19 19:25:00,612,how bout Bayfield??? anyone?
259792,Canuck2fan,2008-10-19 19:43:00,1444,the tournament was on at Bayfield google it and see if the results are up yet... I heard it was no better than the Maitland or Nine Mile but didn't waste the gas to drop by and check it out for myself firsthand.
259844,aws,2008-10-19 23:45:00,53,Okay I got skunked  - but saw 7 rainbows caught on the maitland They were floating roe bags.  I was using cleos.  A buddy of mine was at bayfield all weekend and saw 3 fish caught
