259217,Ramble,2008-10-17 05:21:00,713,I'm sure you all heard voter turn out was at a new low of 59.1 %  Of the 13 some-odd million people who voted only 37.6 % voted for the conservatives. That 37.6% who did vote for them only represent 22.2% of the population who are actually eligable for voting.  Those numbers look more like my grade 11 report card then election results lol.  -R-
259226,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-17 10:41:00,3761,wow
259241,watertight,2008-10-17 12:10:00,50,"I think perhaps we vote parties out rather than in.  Look how long it took to get rid of Mulroney, then the Chretien/Martin bunch. Mr. Harper will be shown the door in due time.The low turnout shows how lacksadaisical a population we are ."
259251,muskie_bob,2008-10-17 12:58:00,13,"You would think with all the trouble in the economy, people would be inspired to vote.  Typical Canadian behavior.  We let ourselves get ripped off by oil companies without taking any effective action and complain about the government but do not vote for change."
259253,wallyboss,2008-10-17 13:01:00,1095,"Most Canadians knew that the Tories were going to end up with another Minority governement. So why were these elections even called. It was a waste of $10 millions of taxpayers money, to end up with exactly what we started with. I think the reason a lot of people never even voted was because are choices were . Which of the lesser evil do we vote for??"
259256,mistyriver1,2008-10-17 13:04:00,600, Isn't that always the way ....
259263,crappieperchhunter,2008-10-17 13:12:00,2582,"45 years old and I have never voted, prolly never will. Why? Because I feel it is pointless. With elections happening as frequently as they do, I feel that the politicians work harder to get re-elected and not to offend anybody rather then rolling up there sleeves and doing what really needs to be done. How can you honestly expect to effect change if you get voted out in 4 years and the new party tears down your plans before they can even hope to accomplish anything? The whole system is flawed as far as I am concerned.  I have always worked hard and managed to squirrel enough money away to survive whatever the government tries to put us through. If you are sitting around waiting for the government to solve all your life's woes be prepared for a whole bunch of disappointment.  I have nothing against anybody who votes. It is your right and good for you for exercising it, I just choose not to.  My father who always votes says "" If you don't vote, then you have no right to complain"". I kind of agree with that. So I just grin and bear it and then move on."
259268,Greencoachdog,2008-10-17 13:26:00,8163,Maybe the other 40.9% were out fishing!
259274,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-17 13:39:00,2050,"Well put,  I agree %100  Cheers, UF "

259311,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-17 14:59:00,835,I think it was crap overload.  With the American election running full tilt at the same time and Harper running attack adds against Dion for over a year everybody just ran for cover.  Liberals should take a lesson from Harper and produce their new leader a week before the next election so they can't pick him to pieces for a year.
259334,kemper,2008-10-17 15:59:00,2232,"Thing is, what do we get if we institute voting laws (Austrailia)? We get a whole lot of people voting that have NO IDEA who, what, where, when or why they are voting. This is more of a problem if you ask me.  If the people that have no clue dont vote, it just makes my vote worth more."
259358,SBCregal,2008-10-17 17:27:00,688,i guess this means that 40% of the population have no right to complain about how things are run
