Yonge and Eglinton, perched on the 15th floor looking south  has been my home for the past 10 years, a great area to work and an amazing neighbourhood to say the least. I'll miss it for sure, What I'll miss the most is walking down Yonge with my daughters who work at Canadian Tire. I'm sure I'll be back for visits but it won't be the same driving to a new location after so many years."

259284,lew,2008-10-17 13:56:00,12767,"Best of luck in your new location and hopefully you get moved in without too many problems. It can be quite a shock to the system trying to get used to new digs.  Out of my 32 years as a fireman here in Toronto, I spent 25 of those years in the same firehall and you sure do get settled in after awhile, almost like a 2nd home."
259297,Leecher,2008-10-17 14:32:00,7832,Good luck to you.   It sure will take some time to getting use to the new place.
259298,ccmtcanada,2008-10-17 14:33:00,7971,Good luck with the move!  I know what you mean though....I've been here at Yonge/Eg since 1992.  It's a great area!  Looks like our offices may be moving around 2012.  When is your last day here?
259344,jdmls,2008-10-17 16:26:00,575," LMAO ... he couldn't find his Steelhead gear even if he wanted to.. The old timer is well retired !!!  Al , where's your organization moving to ?"
259348,ketchenany,2008-10-17 16:39:00,3229," How come we never left you on Simcoe!  We are going to King and Dufferin, today is our last day here."
