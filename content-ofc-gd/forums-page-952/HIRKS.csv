Davy was very helpful and seemed to know his stuff, also there are alot of things there for my kind of fishing and if not he will order whatever i need. Also it is nearby all of the rivers (ie bowmanville, Wilie, ganny, oshawa,) and of course lake Ontario and the karwathas. you guys should come take a peak just at hwy 2 and Prestonville in courtice. It is a fantastic store, location and management."
