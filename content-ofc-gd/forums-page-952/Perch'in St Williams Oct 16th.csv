Yesterday with the weather reports of rough water out on the lake I made the decision to do some inland fishing instead.  An hour drive to Longpoint and St. Williams to meet up with Scott and Ryan we were off.  A beautiful start to the day as the rain had stopped and by 8:00 am the sun had started to shine.  The day started out really well with two jumbo perch and then slowed to almost nothing by 9:30 am.  We picked up and moved away from EC10 and were again right into the perch.  After several hours we had enough of the non stop action.  There were lots of little dinks but keepers as well.  Enough were taken home by Scott and Ryan that they will have an awesome dinner.  It was great spending the day with the two of you!  Hope to see you for some spring salmon action!      P.S. If you are heading up to St. Williams and need bait you might want to go out of OldCut, all the other bait shops were closed."
