I didn't even load any rods or tackle in the truck,(figured it was better to go cold turkey), thought about taking the Minn Kota but then decided it was just a day trip. So the boat is now ready to sit under its blanket of winter snow, just waiting to be released to splash and bump along the water in the spring. But as I said in a previous post, there is always the 12ft. should the urge get to great. Well hope you all have a great time in what ever time you have left in your fishing season"
259604,Leecher,2008-10-18 23:00:00,7832,speckchaser at least you have the 12ft as backup and there's still a lot of soft water fishing to do..... that is if your not going hunting  Leechman
259605,Hawg Hunter,2008-10-18 23:09:00,204,Holly 1 1/2 hrs away and the fishing just starting to heat up on quinte.  man i hope you can stand it   lol.  Hawg Hunter
259648,speckchaser,2008-10-19 02:22:00,17,"Ah well Hawg theres always a way around things. Like having certain friends with boats closer than mine,(wintering in the Haliburton area),hmmm Skeeter comes to mind..lol. But if the weather holds the 12 ft. will get some use before the hard water comes along. And to Leechman I don't hunt, but I know some guys that are going up for a week and I may run up about mid week and fish as they hunt."
259652,Leecher,2008-10-19 02:36:00,7832,Cool..... Do you do any hard water fishing in your area??
259656,speckchaser,2008-10-19 02:48:00,17,just the odd trip to Simcoe. Sometimes go up to the Haliburton area for a weekend with some of the guys or the wife if she wants to go...lol
259658,Leecher,2008-10-19 02:53:00,7832,k....cool.... so not so sad after all.... you still have some fishing time ahead of you
259695,limeyangler,2008-10-19 13:09:00,5204,saddest part of putting my boat away is that its too cold to sit out there in....lol....but my fishing season only gets a 2 week break at most as i wait for at least 4-5icnhes of good ice....lol....some will go out on less...not me.....i'm chicken....or should i say smart?
