259423,Muskieman,2008-10-17 21:44:00,2472,"Muriatic Acid.....mixed 40%  acid   60% water..   soap and water afterwards.  Can't keep it on the shelf.....most marinas are snapping it up.  'Tis the season.  If ya wanna go ""GREEN""   Captain Phab...Hull Cleaner works pretty good ..  I've used soapy water and a scrub brush...and have got the same results but I used alot of elbow grease.  :Gonefishing:   RFS"

Heard people use toilet bowl cleaner...would not suggest that.  There are other brands on the shelf at C-Tire that have the same stuff in it as the Fab."
