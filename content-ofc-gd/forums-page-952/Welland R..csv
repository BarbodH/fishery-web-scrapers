The big boys didn't want to come out and play.  Some small bass and lots of big gills and jack perch. Ran out of minnows and kept feeding them micro jigs til the sun went down. What a fun day. No better way than to end the day up with a little snack for me and the pups    Every cast produced a fish, and few were dinks. It just don't get any better. I almost felt guilty catching so many fish while others looked on    I said ""almost"""
