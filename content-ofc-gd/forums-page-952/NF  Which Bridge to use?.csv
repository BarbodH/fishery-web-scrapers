259683,Cudz,2008-10-19 12:08:00,2652,Should I use the Queesnton Lewiston bridge or the peace bridge to get to Buffalo?
259701,Scott S,2008-10-19 13:32:00,203,"It depends on where you are going, but the peace bridge is the better if you ask me. When you google or use mapquest they always tell you to use the queenston-lewiston bridge. Plus if your going to the walden galeria mall it's only 10-15 min to it. Hope this helps Scooter"
259702,jwl,2008-10-19 13:47:00,1056,"Peace Bridge....the Queenston-Lewiston bridge gets super backed up with delays some times, and besides it's still at least a 1/2 hour drive pretty much to Buffalo from there..as for dire4ctions...can't miss it..take the QEW Fort Erie bound all the way to the end"
