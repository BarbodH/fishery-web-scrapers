259275,Reel Trouble,2008-10-17 13:42:00,14,Its -2 frost  everywhere  and Im off to Lake Wahnapitae for those huge glassy eyed Walleye. My wife is looking at me and shaking her head L.O.L. Got to go
259299,ccmtcanada,2008-10-17 14:35:00,7971,Hmmm....the main difference here is that my wife would already be outside in the car waiting to go fishing in those temps....LOL.  There is a fine line between crazy and obsessive....  Go get em!
259300,Greencoachdog,2008-10-17 14:37:00,8163,Keep those camera batteries warm!  
259304,limeyangler,2008-10-17 14:45:00,5204,Go get 'em reel trouble....its minus 1 degrees here....but i'm headin out with a buddy myself at 2pm....cant wait...tight lines to you.
259308,snagmaster,2008-10-17 14:49:00,250,not crazy at all....It might be cold out but im still jealous cause I have no one to go with today and simcoe is calling my name...goodluck on the water
259312,Leecher,2008-10-17 15:01:00,7832,uummmm..... the things we put ourselves through for the love of the sport......  I say not crazy and certainly not obsessed    go get'em
259314,98Fahrenheit,2008-10-17 15:05:00,108,Well ... some people are more concerned about work than fishing ... I really don't understand ... life is not all about working ... why work 6 days a week for a firm and have only one day to rest?  It's not like they care about your well-being ... if the hierachy cares ... they would hire more staff ...  Why worry about other client's finances when you don't have time for yourself to enjoy life?  Who cares!  The office is strictly for Mondays to Fridays ... weekends are to relax ... regardless if you fish or don't ...  If work piles up in the office ... so be it!
259318,KelfuN,2008-10-17 15:16:00,246,"I have a wedding to go to tonight. was planning to fish the morning then jet home to get ready for the party.  but crap came up, im stuck at work till 3.  i hate it when a trip is all planned out then things happen last minute"
259320,tinbanger,2008-10-17 15:20:00,1028,will be breaking ice at the launches soon ...can't wait
259324,Wild,2008-10-17 15:32:00,704,"Hey Reel, let's hold back on the issue until there's at least two feet of snow on the ground!"
259439,Sinker,2008-10-17 22:30:00,8692,"That's not crazy at all. If you think that's cold, you gotta get out more in the winter!! -2 is just a nice cool day......throw on a longsleeve shirt and your good to go!!  Sinker"
259474,JohnF,2008-10-18 02:16:00,3494,Try scuba diving under the ice. That's cold.  JF
259501,ecxstriper,2008-10-18 06:38:00,343,Crazy or obessive I don't care . I live for it! It is 2:30 am and I'm not asleep because I was up talking to Bly about her week of fishing    and planing my out for Saturday night.
259508,Greencoachdog,2008-10-18 11:00:00,8163, Did she catch anything Alex???... she doesn't ever tell us squat anymore!
259510,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-18 11:57:00,1362,"Obsessive yes....crazy NO way!!....I love to see these cooler frosty mornings starting to come....this will get those big Ottawa R. Skis to start their fall gorging  .......I'll keep my pontoon boat on the river until the first good 1"" of ice starts to form before I take it off...hopefully that won't happen until mid Dec  ......heading out shortly for a Musky hunt"
259511,johnnyb,2008-10-18 12:49:00,3413,"Okay, so, that was yesterday -- how'd you do?  Or are you back at it again?"
259512,lew,2008-10-18 12:51:00,12767," Best of luck today TroutnMuskieHunter, and hopefully you nail a real pig !!  The Ottawa River is a favorite musky spot for me too, but unfortunately I never got out that way this year. First time in about 5 years I've missed it but will be back next year for sure.."
259557,Rich,2008-10-18 19:56:00,3927,- 2? That's it? That's neither crazy or obsessive IMO
