Regular $399 ....on sale for $197  It's an LG model LN740 on sale at 2001 Audio Video  Guess you could get all the info on the unit at the LG website.  Just an FYI if anyones looking for a GPS  "

259612,bassfighter,2008-10-18 23:23:00,366,"Buy a Talking auto/marine GPS. Only two options out in the market Magellan crossover or lowrance XOG  I bought the Magellan 2200T GPS at ebay for $55, upgrade latest map and convert it to Crossover(2500T) model cost another $50. I just need to buy the Navigation map for whatever lake I wanted, which cost around $200. It uses SD card and you can download latest Point of interest from GPSpassion.com. IT is also waterproof  I can used it during weekdays on road and use the marine or outdoord during weekends. NO other more efficient/inexpensive way for now."
