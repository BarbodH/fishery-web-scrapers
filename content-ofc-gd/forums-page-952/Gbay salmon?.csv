259225,singingdog,2008-10-17 10:40:00,1047,"Looking to do some river-mouth salmon fishing. Has anyone been out on southern Gbay lately? Any action? If you don't want to post here, I would appreciate a PM."
259247,okumasheffield,2008-10-17 12:36:00,318,I would like to know the info as well  Thanks in advance
259277,12footspringbok,2008-10-17 13:44:00,459,"The salmon are mostly done on the G-bay trib i fish, however there is still some straglers around and will continue to be a few for a while yet. I'd try for some rainbows instead if i were you."
259285,okumasheffield,2008-10-17 13:58:00,318,It is over already?  I thought it has not started yet!
259291,Fisherman,2008-10-17 14:18:00,7201,"It was so bad this year, it may as well not even started, probably the lowest numbers ever."
259302,DANIMAL,2008-10-17 14:40:00,215,with the high water this year almost all of them came through in 1 day. it happend about a month ago. Good for the spawn.
259360,bukee,2008-10-17 17:39:00,58,"Yup not many caught by the river mouths, as was stated witht the high water they just blew by.  Hearing that the trout are in the rivers and being caught on a semi regular basis."
259364,wuchikubo,2008-10-17 17:57:00,1114,"I have fished the Notty mouth since the beginning of September and have spoken to other anglers that frequent the rivers, from reliable anglers, I gather they started mid August and were pretty much done by 2 week of September (about the time I caught my Coho). I've been up there the last four weeks and have not had much of a sniff let alone a bite. The rainbow trout already appear to be slightly deeper into the rivers this year compared to last year (likely due to higher water). Seen one brief hook up (lasted about 5 secs) last week by a person bottom fishing with roe in the 3 hrs I was there.  I'll likely be up there again this Sunday, if I land a fish, I'll post it, if not, well.....  Tight lines,  Stan"
259366,krawler,2008-10-17 18:09:00,167,"Friend said he caught his first salmon in the rivers up there on Aug 14th after a huge rain.  he said by first week of sept run was over.  im still catching salmon right now, still some silver ones coming in.  the river i fish get s a run of salmon in november every year after the first heavy rain.  stay on the rivers and fish them, timing is key is no salmon then u should get some small bows."
259370,BillM,2008-10-17 18:33:00,17367,No salmon for me but a few shakers this year in the Notty.  I'll most likely be fishing it again this weekend..  The cooler temps at night should have gotten things going a bit.  I'll still most likely be tossing spinners as I haven't made my mind up about a float rod/reel or a noodle rod/spinning setup.
