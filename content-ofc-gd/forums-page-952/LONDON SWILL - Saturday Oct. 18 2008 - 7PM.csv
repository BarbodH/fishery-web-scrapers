255181,SlowPoke,2008-10-03 22:50:00,2984,"LONDON SWILL - Saturday Oct. 18 2008 - 7PM - FINAL SCORE  Final Score Bar & Grill 850 Wharncliffe Road South 519 686-7500  Click HERE for Map  Terry has offered us half price wings and a discount on draught pitchers in anticipation of 20 people attending.  Leafs vs. Penguins on the tube! Spouses welcome!  It's a little earlier than usual but out-of-towners shouldn't have to worry about inclement weather in mid-October! Also, Muskiestudd has taken on a new career and scheduling will be a big issue. It wouldn't be the same without 'studd there. Although, we wouldn't have to keep an eye on our fries  hmmm...  GaryV will be sorrowly missed in body but will surely be there in spirit.  "
255186,jjcanoe,2008-10-03 23:09:00,744,count me in  jjcanoe

255865,SlowPoke,2008-10-06 08:48:00,2984,Thanks for the bump JJ
255872,Greencoachdog,2008-10-06 09:54:00,8163,  I'm wondering how this picture exists since nobody ever brings a camera to those London swills???
255957,Handlebarz,2008-10-06 17:56:00,3790,Will try and make it but might be out fishing that day LOL it would be nice to make a day trip to Woodstock and do some shopping then hit the swill on the way home. If we can get rid of the kids it might be doable.
255998,Wendel,2008-10-06 21:38:00,213,"would be great if you could make it Mike... you know what just give me your wish list for Jos's and I'll fill it lol No musky gear left there, already bought it all J/K Was great seeing you on Sunday.... Are you going to post that picture of keep it all to yourself?   Maybe wait another month... yeah, that's a good idea"
256014,Woodsman,2008-10-06 22:24:00,1286,"I'll try to make it. It's a busy weekend for me teaching a Advanced Medical First Responders course for 10 hours (+ prep time) on both Sat. & Sun. I have not missed one yet so why start now. And I know the swill would not be the same without my Packer hat, as it has not missed one yet either.  Best Wishes: Rick"
256117,SlowPoke,2008-10-07 10:00:00,2984,"Rick, if you can't make it at least send the hat!!"
256936,jjcanoe,2008-10-09 17:43:00,744,Bump (PIN??)  jjcanoe
257174,SlowPoke,2008-10-10 08:59:00,2984,"JJ, if you keep bumping this thread more people will show up. More people = less wings for us."
257427,jjcanoe,2008-10-10 22:54:00,744,plenty of wings for everyone I'm more worried about them runnin out of beer!!!  jjcanoe
257969,Fishn Technishn,2008-10-13 15:07:00,198,I will try to make it. I have been trying to make the last few but something always manages to get in the way!!   I don't think you need to worry about running out of beer. London is Labatt's hometown. We can walk down to the brewery & show them how thirsty we are... I am sure they will believe us!!  FT
257996,Vanselena,2008-10-13 17:28:00,269,Would love to have gone but that is the same day as the Sarnia one day Salmon Derby and food drive. Next time
258373,taper,2008-10-14 22:34:00,611,"Brian I am going to try and make it. 7 actually works well, that should get me home in time for UFC. By the way I hear you are going to be getting this radio for Goran."
258656,SlowPoke,2008-10-15 19:06:00,2984,Hope to see you there and thanks for reminding me about the radio.
259542,Woodsman,2008-10-18 18:19:00,1286,Looks like I can make it. The course was postponed.  See you all tonight:Rick
259559,jjcanoe,2008-10-18 20:04:00,744,"  HMMMM???? almost like a bachelor party, no cameras allowed?"
