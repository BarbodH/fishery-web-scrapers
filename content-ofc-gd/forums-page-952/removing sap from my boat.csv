259108,jwl,2008-10-16 22:54:00,1056,"since there are tonnes of boaters on this site that usualy have a tonne of input when someone asks a question, I have one of my own.  I had the bigger boat up at my camp for the last while to get in some summer fun with the kids and such. My trailer lot has huge pine trees on it and of course along with that comes a huge mess sometimes from the sap and such.    I have a few spots on the motor cowling and my leather seats I would like to get rid of while I clean it up and get ready for my winter river fishing season.  Any of you folks have any good tips for getting rid of the mess from the sap????"
259109,Bernie,2008-10-16 22:59:00,3190,I usually use varsol to remove pine gum. Lots of white pine around my place so a jug of it is always around.
259113,jwl,2008-10-16 23:03:00,1056," I don't want to wreck the finish on my motor cover, and also what about varsol on the leather seats????"
259114,Muskieman,2008-10-16 23:14:00,2472,"Varsol shouldn't  damage anything.....if you're worried try it on a "" sight unseen"" spot like under the seat...or on the foot of the motor.......wash it off with soap and water right after ..  I've used Varsol and Thinner...to wash off tar and sap.... and yellow paint from the highway off the finish of my vehicles...no damage yet...... just don't let it soak.    Good Luck!  RFS"
259115,mbac31,2008-10-16 23:19:00,904,Goof off works wonders. I have the same problem with mine. 2 large pine trees and it works very well.
259117,Rizzo,2008-10-16 23:28:00,4754," if that's true, come by my place and take my entire staff, we got all kinds of goof offs  :D"
259119,jwl,2008-10-16 23:36:00,1056," do these goof offs know how to clean boats??  thanks for the tips..I was going to try under the seat where you wouldn't notice so much..I am not much into wrecking a couple hundred dollar seat   same as the finish on my Merc.  I am going to give it a try tommorrow,change the lower unit oil,take out all the remnants of summer fishing stuff, and load it back up so I can have the boat all ready to get dirtied up again for round 2 of the season this fall/winter"
259129,Nemo,2008-10-17 00:27:00,727,Pine sap can be dissolved in butter.
259134,Wild,2008-10-17 00:47:00,704,Any solvent will remove the oils in leather and cause cracking. Try softening with armorall. Hey Rizzo will you be changing to your summer avatar soon?
259150,gdelongchamp,2008-10-17 01:34:00,199,I would recomend barbecue lighter fluid. Works well on tar etc on car seats.
259162,cram,2008-10-17 01:58:00,1733,WD40?
259168,wallyboss,2008-10-17 02:08:00,1095,GooGone  you can get that at CTC.  If that can't get it off nothing will.
259204,GBW,2008-10-17 03:36:00,8460,for a hard surface like the hull try a moist bounce sheet as it works wonders on mine with no damage but I use Spray9 on the leather seats.  I hope that helps...
259206,jwl,2008-10-17 03:44:00,1056,thanks for all the replies folks
259349,charlied,2008-10-17 16:41:00,584,you can always try WD-40 ....it works wonders too!
259414,PAZE,2008-10-17 21:22:00,132,"  I second Goo gone, it takes anything sticky off"
259416,Danubian,2008-10-17 21:23:00,65, Rubbing Alcohol (aka Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol) should dissolve sap and is not that aggressive on leather. This is what I always used to take the sap stains off my clothes.
259427,Big Cliff,2008-10-17 21:57:00,6899,"To remove sap from your boat: Start motor, engage throttle quickly, push sap out of boat. Works every time!  Actually, try the butter or WD 40."
259443,gdelongchamp,2008-10-17 23:00:00,199,try several suggested methods with the kids and you can report the results and the kids can make a school project out of the test and results.
259461,Guest lundboy,2008-10-18 00:32:00,0,http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...fromSearch=true  Works like a charm.  safe on vinyl and paint.
