We qualified, along with 9 other teams, through our best total weight in 3 out of 4 qualifying tournaments (Gloucester Pool, Tri-Lakes, Dalrymple, Balsam).  Our Classic was held on Lake Couchiching on October 15th.  We started off the morning on a shoal that I know and I caught a 3 pounder on a jerkbait on my 3rd cast.  Then it shut down, never even saw another fish.  We had our club classic (Barrie Bassmasters) on Cooch just 2 weeks earlier, and I found a spot in the last 20 mins of the tournament that was full of 3 pounders.  So we headed there ... over the next 3 hours we hooked and landed 4 nice smallies on tubes, we then proceeded to fish for largemouth and never hooked another fish the rest of the day.  Slow day with only 5 fish caught, but we still managed 16.5 pounds, enough for the win!  A BIG thanks goes out to Roger (BPSBassman) and the rest of the tournament commitee for making this series happen.  Had a great time!                  "

259496,bpsbassman,2008-10-18 04:40:00,941,"Congrats again Steve.  You've had an incredible year! You're right Wild, it is very humbling to be beat by a woman fishing solo, but ""Eva the Fishing Diva"" has been kicking our butt for the last two years and I've grown used to finishing behind her.  :D The best part of the season for me was fishing all the tournaments with one of my two boys.  It doesn't get any better than that."
259562,Wild,2008-10-18 20:09:00,704,"Ok it's a bit funny but I say more power to Eva! And keep up the good work guys and gal, let's see a repeat for next season."
