259086,krawler,2008-10-16 22:10:00,167,I have a tear in my neoprene waders above the rubber boot.  not very big but big enough to allow water in.  what can i use to patch up the hole and what glue should i use?  ive tried a few glues but most of them get absorbed into the material and they dont provide enough strength to hold the patch.  Can i sew the hole and then attach a patch?  any suggestions?
259090,chickenhawk,2008-10-16 22:15:00,612,i think you can buy patches with glue on them already....then all you do is iron it on there....worked for me.....good luck    Hawk
259091,solopaddler,2008-10-16 22:16:00,8605,"Easiest type of wader to patch. Using heavy thread sew the tear in the neoprene together. Dab on aquaseal or shoe goo inside and out, let it dry and you're good to go."
259094,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-16 22:19:00,10439,"No need for a patch unless it's quite big. Just use a piece of tape on the inside to temporarily hold the cut together and use Aqua Seal to repair the tear. Apply the Aqua Seal so it gets into the cut and 1/4"" or so around the cut on the outside. Wet your finger and smooth out the glue. When cured (overnight) remove the tape and seal the inside with Aqua Seal. It will be stronger than the original. Don't go overboard with the Aqua Seal you only want enough to do the job and strenghten the immediate area."
