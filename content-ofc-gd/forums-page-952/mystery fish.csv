259151,MJL,2008-10-17 01:36:00,2427,I've only caught 3 redhorses before and they all came from the Ganny (Probably the same species as the one in Ramble On's pic).  They also spawned on me too.  Eggs looked like prime steelhead bait (slightly smaller than chinny eggs but blood red in colour).  I'm guessing it's illegal to use redhorse roe for bait.  The ones I caught I almost mistook for steelhead while fighting them.  long powerful runs and nothing like fighting a white sucker.  My biggest one was around 4-5lbs.  I've heard they grow to double digit size like 13+lbs.  Definitely would love to hook into more.  Great catch!
259164,hammercarp,2008-10-17 02:02:00,964,I've caught redhorse in the grand upto 5 lbs. But that was a long time ago. I have caught a small white one at Dunnville a few years ago. It was pretty enough to put in an aquarium. It was snow white with silver irredecent sides and pink fins. Nice capture.
259504,spinnerdoc,2008-10-18 08:29:00,556,i caught a redhorse a few years back. mine was silvery with reddish fins .....like ramble on i caught them at the moira river.  i went there late summer once and i found it must have been a hundred in a little pool by the rapids. they musta been trapped when the water went down.
259628,TW112,2008-10-19 00:21:00,2,99% sure that is a Silver Redhorse.

258794,Beats,2008-10-16 01:37:00,543,well.. it's a sucker of sorts.  Someone will know the type I'm sure.  I'm gonna say White Sucker.

258810,smbhunter,2008-10-16 01:51:00,186,"That looks like a very large silver redhorse, (not 100% certain, but about 90% sure). My buddy caught one a couple years ago in the Notty, at Angus."
