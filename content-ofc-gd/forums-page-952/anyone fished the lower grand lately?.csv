259668,pikehunter,2008-10-19 03:38:00,1659,Tried the lower on Monday. Didn't try just below the dam but there were quite a few boats anchored there. Didn't see anyone hitting anything in the rest of the lower including the 3 of us in my boat.  The parking lot on the Dunnville upper river boat launch was overflowing with trailers. Looked like that stretch of river must have been crowded with hopeful fishermen and ladies.  Good luck tomorrow and think of me at work.
