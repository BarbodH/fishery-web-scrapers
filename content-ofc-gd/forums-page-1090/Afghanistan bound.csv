156019,1leggedangler,2008-01-31 15:14:00,364,"PLease thank him for his service to this awesome country. Thoughts and prayers for all the boys and girls that are serving overseas. One of the ladies that works with us got her boy home safe and sound after his tour just before Christmas.  Sincerely, 1leg"
156052,holdfast,2008-01-31 17:19:00,1813,"Hopefully your son will be working in the Canadian Area of responsibility.  If he is, and hopefully he is, I can Guarantee he and the other NATO troops will be in good hands.  The Canadians are true professionals and treat other soldiers as their own.  Once in Theatre he would be getting the best possible Information and training available.  This Operation is going to go on for years, unless we do the cowardly thing and loose all trust and pull out.  Your son, would never say no to his mission, as his uniform as ours, Carry's something that only a soldier would know.  Its called Loyalty and Duty.  I wish him luck and courage, and yourself, a sense of pride for him and others.  Hope his tour goes fast for him and his family.  Thanks.  As for me Im in the process of returning to the forces from retirement (1.5 years) and joining the closest Reserve unit which will probably Infantry with the North Saskatchewan Regiment.  I feel I can also help despite my age."
156058,doubleheader,2008-01-31 17:35:00,497,"Lorissa,  God bless all our sons and daughters serving to protect our freedoms.  Please pass on to your son that many many of us appreciate and strongly believe in what he's doing."
156063,ilario11,2008-01-31 17:51:00,41,"it'll help, i suppose...but what is really needed there is about 150,000 MORE troops...  NATO has been half-arsed about the mission... you can't get the situation under control with that small a number of troops.. it's a travesty..."
156065,ilario11,2008-01-31 17:53:00,41,  And our interests... lets not be naive... and there's nothing wrong with protecting OUR INTERESTS...
156067,lew,2008-01-31 17:58:00,12767,Best wishes to your son Lorissa and hopefully him and all the rest are home soon & safe.
156090,Kirk,2008-01-31 20:01:00,347,"1. I support the troops and the war and I don't really understand the gutless doubletalk which separates the two.  2. I also thank God our nations, US and Canada, were full of people with integrity back in 1939 to fight for freedom and democracy.  Those 2 are for you Riparian.  Lorissa: God Bless your son and his family."
156128,bucktail,2008-01-31 22:13:00,1857,God Bless and good fortune. Afganistan was the only action I beleived in. THat bunch of lowlifes really needed to be weeded out of the genetic pool. If you remember this was the same bunch who had Saturday stoning and hangings of non muslims in there main soccer stadium and also destroyed a number of 2000 year old Budhist statues....all before 9-11. The world will really be a better place without this bunch! It's a good cause.  D
156129,Uncle Buck,2008-01-31 22:15:00,1000,"I've got to disagree with you Kirk...  as for supporting the war, I'm canadian born and raised, but of Serbian Descent. The bombing of Yugoslavia/Serbia did no good for the country as a whole... the country was torn to pieces by all sides including the US...  The presence of US/UN ""peacekeepers"" only prolonged the tragedy... to this day there is still conflict and unrest in the country and it's surroundings...  is it right for the US to act like ""god"" and do as they please? i think not.... Somalia, Vietnam, Former Yugosalvia etc, iraq, Afghanastan, how has US intervention helped these countries?  it hasn't...  I'm not trying to start a pissing match, I don't follow politics, nor does it interest me...  Lorissa, our thoughts/prayers are with your son and all troops away from home..."
156132,holdfast,2008-01-31 22:17:00,1813,"Yup its our iinterest to help a country in need.  Its our iinterest to do our part within an alliance.  Its our interest to do a duty that the people of Canada ask of us, through our leader.  Its our interest to stop, cutoff, or impede a fanatics need to kill people in the most cowardly way through explosives, bombing, beheading while tied up.  Ill even go out on a limb here.  All though Afghanistan has nothing to do with oil, lets just say it was, It would be our Interestto fight for oil if our so called friendly OPEC nations decided to choke us to punish us because they Don't Like us.  But that's another story. Its your interest POACHERS PARADISE, to support the War and your Troops.  Lets just say Canada got Invaded, it would be NATOS Interest to help us out.  You may not like the word War, but you have to fight aggression with aggression.  I support this war, like any other war Canada was involved.  Would you believe that we have a province where 95% of the population did not support the two World Wars.  Yea just think, lets say we are successful in Afghanistan, we would have another GREAT FRIEND.  Sometimes when you want to hide behind your Flag, you have to sacrifice.  Sorry Lorrissa, however I hate when people who have no clue whats going on, decide they are going to make a statement that smells derogatory"
156133,holdfast,2008-01-31 22:23:00,1813,"  You are so Wrong, the Bombing you speak of was NATO in Nature.  It stopped the war.  It is at relative peace now.  It was the Yugoslavians themselves that decided to tear their country apart.  It was they themselves that decided to destroy Vukavar and Sarajevo.  Sure the UN prolonged the war.  But it was the UN that stopped the Genocide for the most part.  As far as the US, they became involved way late in the Civil War when they sent some troops in Macedonia where there was peace but the pot was about to explode.  I would know, I spent 2 years of my life in most parts of the country.  As far as I'm concerned, those people should be ashamed that they call themselves Europeans and even humans for that matter.  That was the most Barbaric war since the World Wars."
156137,Gerritt,2008-01-31 22:42:00,6129,"This is going downhill and fast...  God bless all our boys over there... instead of fighting amongst ourselves, channel that energy into supporting the sons, husbands, fathers etc that are living in hell with each waking breath.. that would bring positive change.  Gerritt."

156154,Roy,2008-01-31 23:58:00,13728,"I apologise to Lorissa for locking this thread but what started as a heartfelt adieu to her son is turning into an internet squabble over beliefs. Let's please just wish all of our protectors well and leave the opinions to another thread. Im sure that whether you believe in this conflict or not, you probably (hopefully) don't want any harm to come to these (kids) people who are in the trenches while we're faced with earth shattering decisions such as, should I read this thread or  delete it?"

All the reports say April, but I feel like it will be sooner. His wife and son will be in North Carolina......Finally, looks like Canadians will get the help they need...3200 from Carolinas are being deployed and 2200 from California are being deployed....As soon as I get more details, will update you....It is a shame that our loved ones have to fight for a senseless cause, for that country does not know peace or ever will....

155817,TOM C,2008-01-30 22:24:00,76,I pray everyone of them make a safe and speedy return home.  I wish we werent sending a single one of them for a nation that knows nothing but Hate and will never know anything else. This will get me in trouble but maybe its time to send the afgans back to fight for their own country and keep ours boys home to protect our country. sorry but someone had to say it.
155837,Riparian,2008-01-30 23:43:00,269,"Support the troops, not the war."
155839,bigbuck,2008-01-30 23:49:00,2449,"God Speed to your son and his comrades. Tom C, I wish it were so easy. Afganistan is a crazy piece of real estate, the vast majority of the people there appreciate what we have done for them, the minority however are doing everything in their power to get us to leave, they know they can't win a stand up fight so they have become experts at designing and building IEDs which is how most of our troops have been killed and wounded. They are trying to fight using a remote control. The Canadian contingent there has seen much more fighting and casualties because our troops are actually leaving their bases and going out into the field keeping the Taliban at bay - that's why we have such a high casualty rate, unfortunately, some of the other members of NATO that have troops there don't want their kids going out into harm's way. It burns my butt but at the same time it fills my heart with pride to know that our sons and daughters are there helping the Afgani people, most soldiers who have been there would not hesitate to return, they know they are making a difference."

155851,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-31 00:11:00,957,"2200 of the marines will arrive in March, bringing the U.S. military total to 30,000.  Germany has 3200 troops there and will add 250 soon.  2500 Canadians are serving under the Canadian flag and many more Canadians are serving as members of the U.S. military.  They are among our best.  Thanks to every one of them and thanks to their families.  Those brave men and women are providing our freedom."

Our leaders appear to be begging for help, or trying to embarrass member's leaders into adding support... I wonder what the future of NATO really is? To all the troops over there doing the right thing, I thank and salute you . I hope everyone arrives home safe and sound and please do know that the vast majority of us support you and your efforts.
