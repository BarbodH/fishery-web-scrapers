155308,Puckhead,2008-01-29 15:44:00,377,"It's a coyote.  A fox normally will not trot with it's tail down.  Wolf up, Fox horizontal, Coyote down"
155315,wuchikubo,2008-01-29 16:11:00,1114,"Nauti,  I wish you good luck on your kicking the butt habit. Think about all the fresh air and more money you can enjoy once you do.  As for the vid.  Initially I was thinking fox, but there was something about it that was telling me otherwise, I've spotted many fox while cycling in my youth, and that one was not moving like the ones I've seen before, so I'll have to guess it was a coyote. There were many good points mentioned above, but the sulking trot was the one I think pin-pointed my thoughts. Either way, good on you for getting the vid."
155369,nautifish,2008-01-29 18:28:00,1416,  Thanx so much beans.   I think this is the only way for me to go for me personaly.  On my 5th day now still very early day's. Tougher when you live with another smoker but he say's he aint quitting. Fortunatly we have never smoked in the house so i guess my payback will be when he is out in the freezing cold freezing his gonads off puffin on a F AG     My kids are all grown and i would like to be able to enjoy quality time with my grandkids when they come along.  Not have them visiting some old grey haired woman who is puffin and panting just getting up out of her chair......lol  Thanx again beans .
155372,nautifish,2008-01-29 18:32:00,1416,"   Thanx so much HF  WELL  This turned out to be interesting, for some reason i thought that most of the replies would all say the same animal .  I am actually thrilled i manage to catch this on video especially so close to my home."
155381,largemouth,2008-01-29 18:49:00,112,"nice video, definately not a fox.  it's a coydog or a coyote. the tail always identifys the animal. thanks for posting."
155402,Daplumma,2008-01-29 19:24:00,1961,Good to see you back here.At first I thought fox but then the tail does not seem right.I have seen many foxes in the wild but only one Coyote and it was in Canada so what do I know? Here is a fox moving. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4...h&plindex=3 Here is a Coyote.You be the judge. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=57...h&plindex=2 Joe Congrats on the quitting try this place for help. http://whyquit.com/
155413,BITEME,2008-01-29 19:48:00,1969,That video with the yote is cool 2 years ago i had one come right up to me when i was calling turkeys I kid you not he nuged the end of the barrel and growled at me ...if i wasnt so focused on the bird i would have drilled his nose through the back of his head it was his lucky day should have done him anyway he was pretty mangey looking
155441,ch312,2008-01-29 21:01:00,1590,"ive shot over 10 fox and many more coyotes but im kinda stumped on this one. its hard to tell how far away the critter is on camera so it makes sizing it up even harder. it does look larger than a fox but too slender for a healthy mature coyote.  i say its a coyote from last years litter which is why its body mass looks smaller than a full grown coyote. thats why i like to shoot and ask questions later   (actually, if i was hunting id have bino's to ID the animal)"
155502,nautifish,2008-01-29 23:25:00,1416,"  Thanx hun, I never really left just been very busy is all.  Great video footage i wish mine had been that clear lol."
155504,nautifish,2008-01-29 23:28:00,1416,  Well its nice to know i'm not alone on being stumped....lol.....  I have been thinking about taking up hunting myself this yr but i really am not sure if i could actually shoot something. LOL  I tell myself i could maybe shoot a duck or a goose but when it comes to the actual crunch i just dunno.  Alot of money to fork out if i wimp out.....lol.
155506,Daplumma,2008-01-29 23:30:00,1961,"Not my videos, just did a search.If your video had been clear we wouldn't have had so much fun guessing! Joe"
155510,nautifish,2008-01-29 23:37:00,1416,  This is very true very true.....lol......
155548,holdfast,2008-01-30 01:07:00,1813,"COYOTE, looks like it, walks like it.  Why? its haunched, and walks with a hop to speak of.  Theyre everywhere here."
155556,Cookslav,2008-01-30 01:24:00,1457," Yes hamilton  Coyotes are actually a rather curious creatures, although they keep to them selves most of the time many are not overly shy either. You'll find more coyotes just on the edge of many urban centers then you will out in no mans land for sure. This is Because the cities create a food source for them....  Our Garbage, litter, and ""feeders"" (meaning bird feeders, and people who feed squirels etc.) Attract numbers of edible creatures to the out skirts that are generally well feed, and not as cautious as they should be.  Then throw in some peoples pets such as cats, and small dogs... You get a recipe very attractive to Coyotes.  The past few years we have seen some heavy snow falls as well making hunting a bit tougher for them so they take the easy route to our back yards, and green spaces on the edge of town that house the fat squirels, and neighborhood cats.  Plus the surge in Ontario deer & Turkey populations can't be hurting the Coyote food supplies."
155583,Rizzo,2008-01-30 03:13:00,4754,Shetland pony...get yerself a mini saddle and you're in for the ride of your life
155594,highdrifter,2008-01-30 03:51:00,2534," Nice one.  Actually foxes do have a howl, but it's more like a yelp.  Still, that be a willey ol yotee.  OH And Nauti, congrats on knocking that habit!  Keep it up, you'll probably live longer than these itchy trigger finger putzes.  cheers HD"
155596,Roy,2008-01-30 04:00:00,13728,"Non Mon vieux, c'est un renard. That is a large fox."
155597,highdrifter,2008-01-30 04:09:00,2534," Ben weillons don toué!  Chuis prêt à te gager que c'est un coyote! gay man apart ça, tu me guette ou quoi ahahah!"
155720,nautifish,2008-01-30 17:09:00,1416,okay got it cookslave Hamer is hamilton.....lol....Sorry  We got plenty of deer around here just the other evening saw around twelve doe's all togeather in a feild. Through november saw three bucks all with in the space of a week and one was a big bugga . Never ever seen three with in a week hell last time i saw one was like four yrs ago and that was down near morpeth....lol.
155747,ecmilley,2008-01-30 18:05:00,2163,"looks more fox to me maybe it's a rare grey fox, not many around here they are around."
155827,JerseyDog,2008-01-30 22:59:00,190,"I've seen coyote in Toronto proper, including at Finch and Dufferin, walking along Finch street on the NE side of the corner (he must have come up from the resevoir) and at Hwy. 7 and 400 running up the side of one the ramps in the grassy areas.  They are basically everywhere now."
155942,cisco,2008-01-31 03:34:00,597,"I think it's a coyote. I've also seen quite a few and shot some along with fox. Fox are 10lbs and coyotes are 35lbs. With fox the tail looks bigger relative to the body compared to the critter in the video, and the body of a fox with winter fur doesn't so clearly show the belly curve as with a coyote. Fox also since being so light and fluffy walk/lope in an almost weightless manner, whereas a coyote walks/lopes with a bit of weight going to the paw like the critter in your video. Best way would have been to walk out to look the track over....."
155953,Bernie,2008-01-31 04:44:00,3190,Its a coyote.
156041,steverowbotham,2008-01-31 16:30:00,1800,"As a fish and wildlife graduate, I'm 100% positive that is a coyote"
156100,fishermccann,2008-01-31 20:31:00,655,coyote for sure!
155110,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:59:00,1416,Okay now when u say hammer i assume u mean hamilton right?  I have lived in port dover allmost six yrs now and this is my 1st time ever seeing one in our erea.  Now we have alot of development going on here and i mean alot. Do you sopose maybe they are being driven out of there natural habitat where they would normally hide?  I was allways under the impression that coyotes were quiet shy animals?
155112,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-29 03:04:00,957,It's a fox.  All people don't look alike and the same with foxes.  That one's family could get a job pulling sleds.
155118,TOM C,2008-01-29 03:19:00,76,"Being from out west I have seen thousands of both and if its a coyote than its gay (not that theres anything wrong with that) have never seen one so lite on its feet. Looks to me like a very heathy Red Fox with an extremly good winter coat.  As far as it looking like it was going to howl, it was just checking for scent, coyotes walk like they are saulking, keeping their heads fairly low, where a fox has more of a prance"
155119,waterwolf,2008-01-29 03:21:00,556,"  pretty sure this is what we have in your video , that's definitely a coyote."
155120,irishfield,2008-01-29 03:25:00,26272, 
155122,nautifish,2008-01-29 03:30:00,1416,  Being from out west I have seen thousands of both and if its a coyote than its gay (not that theres anything wrong with that)  Not sure exactly what u mean by it being a gay Coyote? sorry
155123,TOM C,2008-01-29 03:32:00,76,"Sorry tried to explain it with how a fox is alot lighter on its feet, with more of a gate, where a coyote walks more like a dog.   Best way to know what it was is by what color it was?  A fox with a coat like that would have been very red, a coyote would have been much grayer to a light brown"
155125,nautifish,2008-01-29 03:39:00,1416,Well actually when we 1st saw the animal we thought it was a dog.  I know this is probably no big deal to some as some of you see many as some have said. However for me in our particular erea this was a 1st for me. This is not a common sight in my erea.
155127,TOM C,2008-01-29 03:42:00,76,"If theres one there will be more, next time watch for the color, and no matter how many you have seen they are always neat to see again"
155132,nautifish,2008-01-29 03:51:00,1416,It was to far away to see the colour tom. I wish i had had my camera mounted on my tripod at that moment. Would have managed alot clearer video footage.  If it is a Coyote it's only my second time ever seeing one in the wild.
155137,waterwolf,2008-01-29 04:07:00,556,"where we hunt in the mount forest area there are 2 families of coyotes on either ends of the property . just after sunset they start crying out to one another.  makes you feel a bit uneasy if you're on your way out of the woods ,,, there are so many. i know they're harmless for the most part . we get to see them quite often in the morning heading back from to their home base and sometimes pretty close. they are a beautiful animal and their colors vary . but those long legs really give it away. check the video again and revisit my trail-cam pic . it's pretty obvious with something to compare it to.good luck buttin' out . i'm a year baccy free . you can do it too!!!!!"
155143,douG,2008-01-29 04:26:00,2693,"A fox is less than 30 in  long and 12 lbs.    The foxes I have seen were smaller, friskier.  Coyotes are more like dogs, just like that one."
155144,nautifish,2008-01-29 04:29:00,1416,"Not sure where the mount forest erea is sorry!  Before moving to port dover i used to live out in the boonies between scotland and norwich.  My 1st yr back home in canada as i allready mentioned i actually saw my 1st Coyote. It was actually in a field off of bishopsgate road just outside scotland. Sometimes at night i would hear more like yapping not really howling at night and it would sound like alot of animals. My second summer living there i had returned back to Europe for a short visit. On my return home to canada my boy's had told me that they had had a scare. At that time we had adopted a very old springer spaniel who basically had been abused and i took him in . Anyway booker was a pretty lazy old smelly dog....lol and when i say lazy i mean very very lazy. Well one evening around 11.00pm they had let booker out to pee before heading to bed. They told me that they had heard booker bark and beleive me when i say this dog never barked.  So my uncle and my two eldest boy's had gone out on the back deck to see booker vanish around the side of the house. So as they walked down off the deck to the side of the house they said that booker was following a very large animal.  My eldest boy said the hair looked like wire and it was grey and black . Booker was allmost up the rear end of this animal according to my boy's. My uncle said what ever it was it was large,  My boy's swear it was a wolf....lol  even though they have never seen one in the wild. My uncle says it could have been he thinks it looked like a wolf but could not be 100% sure. I guess when the larger animal had seen my boy's it ran off across the road into the woods.  Congrats on the baccy free for a yr,   well done & thanx."
155153,Hooked,2008-01-29 05:01:00,891,"At first, I thought for sure a Fox, mainly due to the trot it had.  But the size, fairly long legs, the distance between its chest and the ground seemed too much for a Fox, I'm kinda leaning towards a coyote.  But if people here experienced Foxes that size before, I would have to say a Fox.  I just haven't seen any that big."
155175,solopaddler,2008-01-29 10:11:00,8605," Hey nauti, I would imagine you'll be seeing a lot more wildlife in the near future  . Is your latest project still a reality? Hope so.  As far as the vid goes it looks more like a coyote to me...  Cheers,  Mike"

I have not been on the boards much alot going on and may i also add i am now on Day four being smoke free.  Am not using any patches or pills or gum Just my will power and lemme tell ya its tough as hell.  .....BUT I AM DETERMINED to kick this dirty habit. So i am just keeping my finger's and toes crossed i can do this.  Anyway i have some video footage i wanted to share with you, Was out yesterday sunday afternoon on the edge of town (port dover) when we came across this guy in a field close to my home.  Now i am aware that this is probably something some people in certain erea's see on more ocasions. How ever here it is not especially in the middle of the day. I appoligize for the poor visability he was quite a distance from us. Now at 1st we thought it was a coyote, Then a Fox, then a coyote again....lol....For a second he did stop and raised his head in what looked to be a howling motion. Unfortunatley i did not manage to turn the radio down in the van in time enough to pick up the sound.  So i am curious what do you think this is?  A fox? or a coyote? Maybe they're are some hunter's here that will find it easier to indentify what it is.     Nautifish."
155027,irishfield,2008-01-29 01:49:00,26272,Blair Witch project... lol  It's a Red Fox.. just by the way it's walking/trotting and holding it's nose and tail. A big fox...but a fox none the least.
155040,Garyv,2008-01-29 01:55:00,547,Looks like a fox to me...we have lots around here.
155043,nautifish,2008-01-29 01:56:00,1416,Ya think Irishfeild?  Blimey i wish it had been more focused. Used to see many red foxes back in the UK had a den not too far from a place i used to live back then.  If it is a fox it is for sure a big one.  Thanx hun.
155049,moosehead,2008-01-29 01:59:00,90,"I would say it is a fox judging by the size of it tail and the way it was walking, coyotes have a much less bushy tail and walk similar to a dog."
155051,Rizzo,2008-01-29 02:01:00,4754,"whatever it is, I'm just glad that music ended...pretty sure my ears are bleeding"

155056,Jen,2008-01-29 02:04:00,833,"Hey Nauti,  Been seeing a lot of those as of late from the windows at our place... that is a coyote.  The height and length of the animal is too tall and long to be a fox.  As well as the fact that a fox would have been mostly sunken into that snow cover...  They are becoming much more prelevent in our neighborhood as of late.  Enjoy and look forward to seeing you on the Ice!  Cheers,  Jen"
155057,Rizzo,2008-01-29 02:04:00,4754,"yes, quite an animal...that's why I suffered through the pain of the ""wuss"" rock"
155059,Gerritt,2008-01-29 02:07:00,6129,We have Coyotes up here Jen? Dang.... better not let Liam out at night..  G
155060,Sinker,2008-01-29 02:08:00,8692,I'd say its a yote as well. Too big to be a fox........if it howled....its a yote. Fox's don't howl. He would make a good shot with the .270  Sinker
155062,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:08:00,1416,"  Thats what i was thinking too jen, I know more about foxes than i do coyotes. I have only ever seen one coyote ever and that was seven yrs ago now...WOW!  It was my 1st yr being back home in canada.  I KNOW FOXES ARE SMALL  Coyotes are not huge but i do beleive they are larger than a fox."
155064,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:09:00,1416,   L.M.A.O  wuss rock?
155065,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:10:00,1416,  Well i am not 100% it actually howled but it certainly did raise its head like it was going to . I thought coyotes actually more yakked than howled?
155068,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 02:13:00,7971,"I have no idea what it is, but congrats and good luck on the smoking thing!!!"
155069,Jen,2008-01-29 02:13:00,833,"Coyotes are in between a fox and a wolf.  They are probaly the size of a small lab.  I have enjoyed watching the wildlife this year and even got to see a coyote up close and personal during the shot gun hunt in December.  One of the men in our group took it in to get mounted.  It was an amazing creature to see.  Their fur is tan, white with speckles of Black and Grey, he weighed probably 60lbs and had the whitest teeth I have ever seen on any dog like animal.  If you take a look in the fields lately there are a great number of them and wild turkey.  Take care,  Jen"
155071,Casey123,2008-01-29 02:15:00,461,"I have to agree with the Coyote.......It looks far to large to be a Red Fox.  My office is in Burlington, there are two coyotes playing around across the street early every morning (before it gets really light)  They are really cool to watch and they keep the cat population down.  Leave your cats inside so they don't kill all the song birds people!!!!  Anyways, very cool video"
155074,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:19:00,1416,  Awww thanx so much CCMT...I think i'm gonna need it....lol
155076,irishfield,2008-01-29 02:22:00,26272,"Foxes get to be pretty large and I've had a rabbid one on my arm, to know it first hand, while reaching back to throw a hay bail at 15 yrs old. Had a second set and type of Rabbies shots in '94 thanks to another huge fox that attacked our 12 week old Lab in the back yard of our old house just up the road. I watch foxes on almost a daily basis in our yard and use to have a mother that would walk in one man door of my hangar and out the other, with food in it's mouth...to save the trip around the structure........and the temptation to use the M1 is there at all times! We have coyotes in the yard too...and they don't walk like that."
155077,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:23:00,1416,"  Well thats why i was so surprised jen. I am allways out and about if not walking different places with the dogs, or fishing, or just walking, just hopping in the van and going for a  drive, and have never come across this so close to home. I get excited like a little kid when i get to see things like this....LOL"
155084,John,2008-01-29 02:34:00,2956,"I'm a little confused by this one. Certainly has the gate of a fox but have never seen one that size before. Even here in Burlington, we see plenty of Coyotes.  Never the less congrat's on the non smoking. It does get better. If you need any encouragement send a PM.  John..."
155088,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:38:00,1416,  Thanx John   I may just do that when i get a strong urge  ....lol   And i'm as confused as you on this it's a tough one .
155091,Gerritt,2008-01-29 02:42:00,6129,"Burlington has there fair share of wild dogs... due to the proliferation of the rabbit population... I have never seen so many rabbits in one area as I have in Burlington it is unreal!.... I was working on a project there for 2 months.. 112 windows, a whack of doors and interior trim.. and we would literally have to lift our feet when sitting outside for lunch etc...  the dogs will follow the prey.  G"
155095,huntervasili,2008-01-29 02:46:00,1604,I would have to say fox too... long slender body close to the ground... and a long tail.
155102,Cookslav,2008-01-29 02:53:00,1457,"That there is a coyote, or Coy dog IMO A bit skinny, but then again this winters been tough on them.  The tell tail is the neck, and shoulder line...Longer profile compared to a fox The bushy tail is also a common feature in Coyotes as well, especially with their winter coat. Plus the legs are a give away to me as they are much longer then the average fox.  Lots of Coyotes in the area outside the Hammer...even more the further west you go. The outskirts of K/W and Guelph is loaded with 'em And there are even more towards the Huron Coast. I can hear them nightly at my Trailer by Kincardine, and saw quite a few of them last year."
