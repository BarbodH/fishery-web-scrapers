155226,Randy,2008-01-29 12:59:00,115,"Musky-Man, for what its worth, I bought a new 50HP Etec this time last year. It replaced a 50HP 2 stroke Evinrude that served me well for over 10 years. I was looking for a new motor with better gas mileage and lower emissions. I initially looked at 4-strokes and almost bought one until I found out about the Etec. I surfed the internet for more information on the motor and a whole host of fishing forums in the US in search of people who bought them.  This search lasted about a year before I decided to buy the Etec because it was new technology and there wasn't a whole lot of experience out there. The fact that BRP is a Canadian owned company also helped, but primarily, it was the positive feedback of other owners.  Although I really haven't charted my fuel savings, I estimate that I use about 50 to 70% less gas than before. As well, no more smoky motor for me as oil is not burned with the fuel. Engine starting is immediate, starting within the first turn or 2 of the motor, regardless of temperature. Noise, this motor is a lot quieter than my old motor. But the thing that really got me was the 7 year warranty.  Hope this helps in making your decision."
155243,bucktail,2008-01-29 13:38:00,1857,Hope not to spoil the party but my buddies friend has one and its been a complete lemon since day one. It has alot of problems with trolling in the cold weather and fouling. It has spent more time in the shop then out. This falls Quinte trip was  the third year in a row it died on him in the cold. I have a 4 stroke Yamaha and it is ROCK SOLID. Just my expierience with them.
155274,2 tone z71,2008-01-29 14:41:00,1311," HAHA Randy the 7 yr warranty yeah ,the first three are genuine BRP the rest who knows what insurance company they contracted that out to,good luck with that after 3 yrs,I took the rebate,notice this yr theres no 7 yr warranty offered"

155408,specktacklure,2008-01-29 19:38:00,56,"Just a comment but alot of people keep bringing up the fact that the Etec is new technology ?? Been around for 4-5 yrs not really new .And how long have 4 strokes been around not much longer..... is the proof really in the puddding about 4 strokes ? People will always slam something that they don't know about.Mercury has been switching who makes there motor for years ..what does that say ? Has everybody forgot about the FORCE motor by mercury ??? Don't know too many mechanics that will even work on them for fear of them blowing up.Do your homework and you will find out that the Etec is by far the better motor and if you say differently you haven't done your homework.The people who slam the Etec are the same people who probably never have used one.And this whole thing about the Etec being a glorified Ficht engine is just plain ridiculous.Brp and Omc ARE 2 DIFFERENT COMPANIES !!!!! At least evinrude has learned from there mistakes and have fixed them can you really say the same for mercury ? All they do is keep switching who makes them (yamaha,tahatsu,suzuki) what does that say about mercury.Just my 2 cents"
155631,Randy,2008-01-30 12:53:00,115," 2 Tone Z71, I'm glad you're satisfied with your choice because I'm satisfied with mine."
155653,Gerry,2008-01-30 14:30:00,257,"To Specktacklure: 1.  I think that you need to do a bit more ""homework"". 4 strokes have around in outboards for 20 or so years, not 4 or 5 years as you state. Honda was the first manufatcurer to bring them to market. I owned a 1996 Johnson 9.9 4 stroke .... I think that makes it 12 years ago and I know that wasn't the first year for them.  2.  Mercury contracts out their 4 stroke production only, not their 2 strokes. Yamaha used to have most of it but now I believe that the smaller HP units are produced by Tahatsu. Tahatsu is a Subsidiary of Nisaan... a pretty good car company."
155657,bucktail,2008-01-30 14:58:00,1857,"""Has everybody forgot about the FORCE motor by mercury ""  Wasn't that made by chrysler?"
155658,irishfield,2008-01-30 15:04:00,26272,"Yes it was Darren and Brunswick/Mercury bought them out and it just took awhile (toooo long awhile) before they got smart enough to toast the line!  The Force Outboard brand was born in the early 1980's when US Marine, the parent company of Bayliner Boats, purchased the old Chrysler Outboard factory and tooling located in Hartford, Wisconsin. Bayliner was the first nationwide company to introduce packaged outboard rigs in which the outboard motor, the boat and a trailer were sold as a single item. Arriving at dealerships fully assembled, these packages were great timesavers for dealers that previously had to custom rig bare hulls with specific engines and accessories chosen by the boats' buyers. Although Force Outboards lacked the technological sophistication of the major outboard brands, their price advantage was significant. Thousands of families discovered their love for boating through these inexpensive Bayliner entry-level outboard boats. In the mid-1980's US Marine was acquired by industry giant Brunswick Corporation (Mercury, Mercruiser, Sea Ray, etc.). The Force Outboard brand quickly benefited from the resources of its big brother Mercury, and all production was soon moved to Mercury's plants. Force Outboards became available on boat brands other Bayliner at dealerships nationwide. The changing marketplace, diminished price advantages and pending government regulations resulted in the decision to discontinue the Force brand in 1999. Parts and service have become more and more difficult for Force owners to find since then."
155659,Terry,2008-01-30 15:05:00,14456,"once again to expand their market Merc bought out chrysler, to use their motor on low end boat packages to give low prices  when it was owned by chrysler it wasn't a bad motor and they figured the HP at the prop unlike most others so their 9.9 would kick everyone elses motors of the same size on my first bass boat in the 80s I had an old 55hp chrysler on the back, I bought a new 60 merc for it. 8mph slower then the chrysler and they tried just about every prop there was it could not compete ...  may  FORCE be with you , cause I would want it..sure went down hill"
154413,Terry,2008-01-27 00:26:00,14456,LOL
154453,Kerry,2008-01-27 03:02:00,383,It has to be a pretty good design as BRP is introducing the same type of system in their SKI DOO snowmobiles.Two strokes are far from dead yet and the technology with today's synthetic oils is proving to be as good as 4 strokes.  Kerry
