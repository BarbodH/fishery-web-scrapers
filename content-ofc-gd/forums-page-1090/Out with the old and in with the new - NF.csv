155207,lookinforwalleye,2008-01-29 12:41:00,4399,"I only see half a vehicle where is the rest of it?  Just kidding, last week I bought myself a almost new vehicle a 6 month old 2007 Dodge Durango it`s a big step up from the 2000 Explorer I was driving.What is amazing about North American vehicles is the depeciation this Durango was a 44-45k plus tax vehicle 6 months ago and I picked it up for 27k it`s like new low km`s V8,leather,sunroof,tow package and it gets better gas mileage than the V6 explorer, I hope it treats me as good as the Ford.  BTW Cliff if that little Kia gets stuck on a ramp give me a call I`ll give you a pull.  Congrats on the vehicle."
155208,Joey,2008-01-29 12:41:00,9122,Gotta love a new car.  Congats to you and Carol  Joey
155216,SlowPoke,2008-01-29 12:48:00,2984,"Unfortunately it might only be worth $14,000 next year I was on the fence about a new(er) ride last week but decided to put some money into my van. I was somewhat shocked to see '07 Chrysler 300 going for $15-16K from $30K 6 months ago. -Brian"
155224,lookinforwalleye,2008-01-29 12:56:00,4399,"Well I doubt that but I have no plans to sell it next year anyways so it`s a mute point, I just hope it`s as reliable as the Ford I don`t have much experience with Dodge I did have a K car back in the 80`s and I pray it`s better than that bucket of bolts."
155446,bigbuck,2008-01-29 21:05:00,2449,"Congrats on the new ride!!! 380k out of a car, it definitely doesn't owe you a thing. Anything past 300k is a bonus with a car. When my old Bonneville SSEi hit 320k (ONLY routine maintenance, electrical gremlins at the end), I put her out to pasture. It was the greatest car I ever owned. I didn't want to put any money into repairs at that point because it probably wouldn't end. This new one should last you quite a long time, the Koreans have really pulled up their socks and have come a long way from the Hyundai Pony and Stellar. Your CRV should easily hit 350k without probs."
155520,bassmaster4,2008-01-30 00:03:00,801,nice ride
155542,holdfast,2008-01-30 01:02:00,1813,"Yup that's a good pick.  Hyundai and Kia are ranked behind Toyota and Civic only because of reputation.  If there is negativity, its from the magazines with all the domestic advertisements.  By the way I bought a new Pony in 87 and the warranty lasted as long as my payments.  That was a no Brainer for me and my young family living day by day.  Only thing missing is your canoe on top."
155602,brickNblock,2008-01-30 04:36:00,598,"Cliff............. Dang man.you Spunky fellar... Right back at 'em with the (NF) stands for Non-Fishing........  Sincerely hope you an Carol get some decent times out of the new ride for some new exellent ........""New Memories"" Hoping to see you both again this summer. You know the invite is anytime........"
155679,bbog,2008-01-30 16:02:00,665,Congrats on the purchase of your new tackle box!
155745,discophish,2008-01-30 18:01:00,392,Congrats!  Now all the car needs is a tail to wag for your boat to chase around!
155001,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 01:24:00,7971,"It's been a whirlwind of a week for us.  Last Thursday, my trusty car....a 1990 Toyota Corolla SR5 broke down on me for the last time.  This car had over 380,000 kms on it....it drove me back and forth to University in the early 90's, to Michigan and back every weekend while bly and I were dating...it went on countless road trips and camping trips.  I've had a lot of great memories in it.  Was is a practical family car?  Not on your life...our family of 4 couldn't sit in it comfortably, but it travelled afar with me.  Last Thursday, something happened that was a sure sign that it was time to let the car go.  A friend of mine, who I drive into Toronto most mornings usually doesn't work on Thursday's, but for some reason decided to head in.  I went to the GO Station for the pick up and I hit the brakes and they went straight to the floor!!  If my friend wasn't working that day, then that would have happened to me on the 401 instead of in a parking lot!!  Anyhow, long story short, I needed to replace the brakes lines, and the fuel line.  Add to that a new timing belt (it was overdue), and a new suspension and I just couldn't justify the repair bill to this 18 year old car.  So, bly and I headed off on Friday to visit some dealerships.  I'm just looking for a smallish commuter car...something good on gas with a good warranty.  I test drove the new Corollas and Civics but my uncle (who used to work for both Toyota and Honda), suggested to test drive the Kia Spectra, because the quality has improved a lot and he'd recommend it to anyone in the market.  Well, the Spectra drove just as nicely as the Corolla and Civic, but was considerably cheaper...and with 0% financing it was really a no brainer.  It also has a 5 year, 100,000km bumper to bumper warranty...Toyota and Honda only offered a 3 year, 60,000 km bumper to bumper warranty.  I bought it on Friday night and drove it home this afternoon.  Here are a few pics...the last pic of me with the Corolla taken just before I traded it in...fittingly taken in front of a Canadian Tire store. (where lately it spent a lot of time being fixed...LOL).  I dont have a pic of the new car yet, but found the same colour and model on the net.  I'll miss the old girl, but safety and reliability are more important right now.    "
155006,irishfield,2008-01-29 01:32:00,26272,Good move Cliff... the next repair would have been the police pulling your plates for rust thru very soon!
155011,Garyv,2008-01-29 01:36:00,547,"A few of the people that live around me have purchased Kia's in the last year or so, all seem to be very satisfied.  My buddy has their version of the mini van and he and his wife just love it."
155026,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 01:48:00,3421,Good for you Cliff can't beat 0 percent financing.Once the car is not safe its time to move on.  Hope the CRV has lots of life left in her  MTP
155031,Crazyhook,2008-01-29 01:51:00,1154,you got your moneies worth eh!! nice job on the new ride...
155066,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 02:12:00,7971,"Wayne.....yep....she deserves the break for the punishment I put her thru for the past 18 years. (and no I dont mean bly)  Gary....I've talked to a few kia owners as well, and they are all very pleasantly surprised by their quality now.  I'm hoping I have the same luck!  MTP....The CRV still runs like new...so I'm hoping for 5 more years!!!  Crazyhook....yep....the Corolla owes me NOTHING...and the deal I got on the Kia was too good to pass up."
155075,ecxstriper,2008-01-29 02:20:00,343,When are we installing the rod holders ? Nice car there Cliff.
155079,nautifish,2008-01-29 02:28:00,1416,Congrats on the ride.
155090,John,2008-01-29 02:40:00,2956,Good move Cliff. Kia/Hyundai have become Toyota and Honda killers in recent years.
155100,fatherof3,2008-01-29 02:51:00,1769,"very nice,congrats"
155130,krawler,2008-01-29 03:47:00,167,useless information!  sorry but how is this fishing related?
155134,irishfield,2008-01-29 03:55:00,26272,Hope it pulls your boat to your favourite fishing hole Cliff !  Hows that Krawler ?
155135,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 04:03:00,7971," Krawler....if you read the rules of the board, it asks that non fishing posts have NF in the title.  If you see that and dont care, then dont click."
155136,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 04:04:00,7971," LOL Wanye....I do shore fish a lot too, and this car can hold my fishing rods/reels and tackle...maybe I should have mentioned that."
155138,FishFinder,2008-01-29 04:09:00,481,"enough with the negativity krawler, some of us enjoy reading about other's personal lives on the internet."
155139,krawler,2008-01-29 04:10:00,167,"Easy explanation, thank you!  no offense, seeing a lot of these NF's lately.  wont look!"
155140,irishfield,2008-01-29 04:15:00,26272,"If you want straight fishing... go check out angling f an a tics. Might take a week between each post...but it will be fishing! Either that or when the next beer bash is.  It's winter...ice season isn't in full swing and these NF posts fill the ""off season"" EVERY year to keep us entertained.  If people can't find joy in another members happiness...then try valium."
155147,Greencoachdog,2008-01-29 04:34:00,8163,  Won't shore fishin' be a thing of the past when the weather warms up? I mean since y'all have the boat and everything now... or can Carole still not catch anything from a boat???   Congrats on the new car y'all!!! I'm sure it will serve you well.
155149,Hooked,2008-01-29 04:45:00,891,"Nice going Cliff.  I was thinking Kia, but heard some bad stuff bout them in the past.  Glad to hear they have improved the quality of their products.  While my car was being fixed last year, my curteous car was Kia Optima.  I must say, that thing was almost too smooth.  I didn't realize how fast I was going kinda fast.  Perhaps I will look at Kia when its time.  Again, congrats, its tough to let go of ol' faithful, well kinda, but best of luck with the new vehicle. BTW, did you get a hitch for it yet?"
155156,wolfville,2008-01-29 05:28:00,396,"So that's the car I'll see comes May when we meet at that spot? Nice car, you'll sure enjoy it."
155159,SlowPoke,2008-01-29 05:57:00,2984,Looks great Cliff! I can't wait to spill something in it!!!! -Brian
155167,medmart,2008-01-29 07:13:00,587,Nice car cliff hope it last you a long time kia makes some nice cars now  rob
155173,solopaddler,2008-01-29 09:51:00,8605,"Congrat's Cliff and as you know I can relate, LOL! Joanne and I literally on the spur of the moment bought 2 new vehicles ourselves recently. I love searching for deals and checking out cars so that part was fun. Selling the 2 old ones is a huge pain though   ."
155184,motv8tr,2008-01-29 11:24:00,2587,"Good stuff Cliff, looks nice!  and ya, I researched Kia before I bought mine and they have come a long way in the last couple of years....i think it helped that Hudai bought them  Enjoy!!!  maureen"
155191,HTHM,2008-01-29 12:02:00,4082,"Useful information: To catch a fish - tie hook to line, wrap a worm of the hook, place in water abd wait. I hope you will find this useful Congrads on the car, you should be able to get it going fast enough to troll for Peterbuilts on the 401."
