155008,Jen,2008-01-29 01:32:00,833,"Monday January 28th, I headed on onto the river for the first time to try for some walleye through the ice.  What a morning it was, learning how to use the vexlarâ€¦yet I did manage one fish for my efforts.  It was a great time and the weather was perfect. My first Walleye ever through the iceâ€¦  I took these pictures tonight of my boys out their trying their luck. They didnâ€™t catch anything but had a great time watching other people bring in their catches.     I can not believe the thrill of watching a fish come up to your lure and actually getting it on the ice. Cheers, Jen"

So strange seeing people ice fishing there and just up the river in cally D its all open water and there were guy's in the water wading and catching some nice fish from what i could see of shore.  Again grl nice one!"

155229,Greencoachdog,2008-01-29 13:05:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  I can't decide if that's a Pickeral or Wall-ice...
155288,Jen,2008-01-29 15:06:00,833," Well I would say that ""Wall-Ice"" is a lot more fitting in this case ...  hehehe"
