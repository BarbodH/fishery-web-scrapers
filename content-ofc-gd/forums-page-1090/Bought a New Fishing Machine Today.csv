155493,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 23:04:00,3421, Yes Tracker its a Tiller I try to stay clear of those winnebago boats that get skunked in the BOQ alot
155497,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 23:09:00,3421, Brian 2 of you would be cramped in that boat lol.Actually with the wide open floor I will have more room than the SSV.  The live well is all those big uns
155498,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 23:13:00,3421," Ya I looked into all that Mike but I wanted IPS Hull livewell,lockable rod storage and lots of storage ask Percher I bring more stuff in the boat than anyone he knows.If you ever ride in a Classic you may change your mind about an SSV.  "
155500,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 23:15:00,3421, Nah Roy why bother with yellow when I can invite Papa Smurf in Blue to fish with me

155712,kennyman,2008-01-30 17:04:00,737,"Sweet boat Mike. That should really fly with the 50hp on it. Watch out fishies ........ here comes the ""pike slayer""."
155719,Smokey,2008-01-30 17:09:00,1278,Very nice Mike and good luck with it.
155734,tonyb,2008-01-30 17:47:00,1637,I think you are one of the few people affected by 2-foot-itis.... but in the opposite direction  The increased beam will always be more noticeable than the length...but any woman could have told you that  I hope that I'm the next one posting pics of their new ride...soon I tell ya!  Tony
155749,discophish,2008-01-30 18:07:00,392,"Nice Boat!  Remember, it's not the length, but the girth ... and how you use it that really counts.  Hehe.  Awesome.  Bet you can't wait to get out!  You will love the stability of that boat's width."
155844,carll2,2008-01-31 00:00:00,443,awesome ride....only about 8 weeks left till you can fish champlain for lakers
155898,Guest lundboy,2008-01-31 01:34:00,0,Hey nice boat!!  We can have a race when I go to Mohawk Bay in May (I'm trying for the 24th & 25th)

154984,Mike the Pike,2008-01-29 00:55:00,3421," Lund 1660 Classic    This is the 1775 Classic which I did NOT purchase but it shows the colour I selected.    Well it was only a matter of time .Today I went out and bought the boat I wanted A new Lund 1660 Classic Grey with black decals.I did keep my motor from the SSV a 50hp Honda  I will miss my SSV 18 foot Lund.Had some good times in her she did see some pretty big waves in the 4 summers I had her.     Finally I have storage,livewell,and a bow mount electric motor .Bass fishin will be much easier.Added some toys like tunes and a GPS fish finder combo.this will be 2ft 3 inches shorter than the SSV but 11 inches wider.  Lets just say after fishing in Percher's boat, my friend Kenny's boat and seeing fishin Devils Lund Classics. I had to Have one.And yes Greencoachdog its a TILLER.Keep yer side Console to yourself  MTP"
154986,Want,2008-01-29 00:58:00,39,I really like the size of that boat. AND it will boogie with that motor. Congrats
154994,irishfield,2008-01-29 01:12:00,26272,It's not always length that's the ticket Mike! That wider beam will be great on the BOQ.
154996,Rizzo,2008-01-29 01:15:00,4754,congrats on the new vessel
155005,Terry,2008-01-29 01:31:00,14456,"nice boat bud  dang, I am slipping behind on the toy list seems I am needing to buy a new boat to keep up"

155164,SlowPoke,2008-01-29 06:29:00,2984," These guys look a little cramped in the 16'er. By the way, why do you need a livewell? Congrats Mike! -Brian"
155166,medmart,2008-01-29 07:03:00,587,Very nice boat mike you will have a lot of good days in it  rob
155172,solopaddler,2008-01-29 09:41:00,8605,"Sweet boat Mike, but you know for the price of some marine plywood, carpeting, some hatch covers a small bilge pump and some elbow grease you could've retrofitted the SSV the way you wanted. (I love the SSV's, big fan  ). Did you trade it in? If not I'd be happy to take it off your hands!"
155200,aplumma,2008-01-29 12:26:00,6896,nice boat but its a TILLER ...... no really nice boat its to cold to start the old tiller /console post.  Happy fishing Mike   Art

155225,Greencoachdog,2008-01-29 12:57:00,8163,"Operating a boat from the transom?... How primitive!!!  It does look and sound like a real nice boat, even if it doesn't have a steering wheel. The creature comforts will add to the enjoyment, and maybe... just maybe... help you catch a fish!  Did you get the Humminbird?    He needs the livewell to keep the minnow buckets in Brian!"
155327,fishindevil,2008-01-29 16:55:00,6254,CONGRATS MIKE !!!!!!.  ..welcome to the classic lund club buddy..  ...nice fishin machine ....cheers
