155467,irishfield,2008-01-29 21:58:00,26272,Nope... scrap the link please!
155515,Roy,2008-01-29 23:57:00,13728,"I think that when someone is bidding on something on Ebay or anywhere else for that matter, it's very bad manners to post the link on a public board. Sorry Cory but that was very uncool."
155536,irishfield,2008-01-30 00:29:00,26272,"Thanks Roy... I'm sure Cory meant no harm and was just razing me about my tackle buying habits, but this is the second time this auction has been linked from here this week, by people knowing that I was bidding on it, and doing so did manage to bring one browser out of the wood work to bid on their first item in over 5 years. I know what I'm willing to pay for this collection and it will wait 'til the last minute. If I get them.. I get them and if I don't.. well I don't need them.............................. and besides there's a never ending supply from somewhere at all times!"
155554,irishfield,2008-01-30 01:17:00,26272,Okay...bid on what you want. I'm done for a few days!
