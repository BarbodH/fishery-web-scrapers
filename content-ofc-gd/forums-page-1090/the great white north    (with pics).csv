Archie supplied us with four nice huts and treated us like gold for the weekend. thanks from all archie, will do again. met up with my Dad Gordy ,two brothers and uncle. We fished off coffin island, and all of us easily caught our limits and missed many more. fish were on for sure. my buddy Alex got a huge surprise when he pulled a 5 lb. whitefish out of 11 feet of water. Archie mentioned first he had ever seen from that area. congrats Alex. managed a few pike also. here are some pictures from this weekend , again thanks to my dad (Gord Monty) and sugar shack rentals for a great time. we were fishing Lac De Mille Lacs in ignace ontario       king  for the weekend  4lb.5oz walleye by my dad  "

155779,tbayboy,2008-01-30 19:43:00,1497,"Sounds like a great way to spend time with the family and friends.  I was suppose to hit lac whenI was home for the holidays but it wasn't meant to be (stupid family expecting to spend time together over the holidays - what a bunch of.. err nm).  I've heard great things about archies setups as well, sure looks like a great cabin.  Thanks for sharing."
155822,danc,2008-01-30 22:41:00,4677,Archie is well known in the area for his Sugar Shack rentals. I've not heard of one complaint yet. And you can bet that Archie placed them over very productive waters. His summer Salmon charters are top class as well. Glad you had fun Monty.
155914,Mike the Pike,2008-01-31 02:04:00,3421,Nice report Monty looks like a great place to bunk and fish.
