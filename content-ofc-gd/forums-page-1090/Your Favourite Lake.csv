155714,Smokey,2008-01-30 17:06:00,1278,"Of all the Lakes I've fished before, My choice would have to be Lake of the Woods. Scenic and all types of fish it would be tough to beat.  As for a lake I dream of fishing and so many good things I hear about the lake, it would have to be Lac Seul."
155774,live2fish,2008-01-30 19:28:00,70,Lake ONTARIO
155783,iceguy,2008-01-30 19:52:00,341,Lake O for me as well.

155801,irishfield,2008-01-30 21:04:00,26272, I know your favourite Pickeral Lake Pete... did you want me to list a few of it's rocks coordinates! LOL
155814,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-30 22:18:00,2585,nipissing or gbay  Cheers!
155819,chickenhawk,2008-01-30 22:36:00,612,"Glad to see that i am the first to say Booths Harbour, on Long Point Bay, Lake Erie i just can't get enough of those summer smallies and of course the beer drinking we do at night.  Fish during the day, drink as much as you can at night and wake up at the crack of dawn to do it all over again!"
155857,wjw,2008-01-31 00:36:00,35,My favorite is the Upper French River/Lake Nipissing. Second choice would be the island area of western Lake Erie.
155861,bramptonjerry,2008-01-31 00:40:00,132,"Horwood....great walleye, great scenery...lot's of privacy"
155904,Domi Fish,2008-01-31 01:38:00,46,Gotta go with Lake Ontario.
155905,danbouck,2008-01-31 01:42:00,4380,Havn't found it yet! But I guess i'll say Erie for now!
155936,Squid,2008-01-31 03:09:00,1656,Nah that's ok Wayne. Thems feeder fish anyhoo. The lake would have to have muskies and far away from people traffic.
155951,camillj,2008-01-31 04:30:00,1988,Wow ... what a shame to have to pick with so many lakes as yet unfished ... but for me assuming travel was not the issue (otherwise Id go with something really close to home - quantity vs quality does matter when we're talking forever) ... I think Id go with Great Bear
155970,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-31 12:04:00,1362,"I'd have to go with the Ottawa R. as my first choice seein how it's my backyard and the Muskie are HUGE!!!!  ......2nd choice even though I've only fished it once, is Temagami....."
155262,Beans,2008-01-29 14:08:00,3339,Right where I am right now...North shore of Pigeon Lake...Haven't quite figured out all the best spots and I'm running out of time...Be nice if we could icefish for crappie and perch...
155271,OhioFisherman,2008-01-29 14:35:00,6623,"Put me in the boat with Jigger, GB, lots of water, lots of species, lots of different water types and scenery, and some good sized fish."
155323,jeffw,2008-01-29 16:47:00,267,"I would have to say balsam lake, nice walleye, muskie and pig smallies and largemouth. Lots of crappie now to boot. Cheers Jeff"
155328,Fang,2008-01-29 16:59:00,1330,"I'll probably be the only one to say it but for me Lake Temagami  For those of you who want a ""stay tuned"" report I'm hoping Big Sand Lake in Manitoba is all it is supposed to be. Watch for Summer report"
155329,mistyjr1,2008-01-29 17:10:00,97,Upper Lake X is really good for bass and pike.  But Lower Lake Y is really good for everything else.
155349,fishindevil,2008-01-29 17:37:00,6254,Well thats an easy one to answer the one & only....THE MIGHTY OTTAWA RIVER.....
155387,trapshooter,2008-01-29 18:55:00,1234,"Lac Seul.  No Question.  Trophy bass, muskie, walleye, pike, whitefish.  Enough water to keep you busy your entire life and best of all... it's remote and relatively low pressure."
155393,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 19:10:00,7971,"With the exception of a few trips to the Kawarthas, I fish primarily Lake Ontario and it's Tributaries, so I'd have to say that that is my fav lake at this point.  My view may change now that I have a boat though and plan as many trips to different lakes as possible next season."
155399,Bernie,2008-01-29 19:20:00,3190,I have been fortunate to fish Nipissing all my life and look forward to doing it for a few more years to come. Lots of types of fish and ways to catch them.
155401,Sandbag,2008-01-29 19:21:00,533,Lake St. Clair  Great variety of species in softwater and a pretty decent hardwater season as well  Cheers  Craig
155423,rickster,2008-01-29 20:11:00,495,WITHOUT A DOUBT   Lake of the woods  NO WAIT........  Rainy lake  ya for sure Rainy or maybe Lac seul or Pipestone or Little Turtle no maybe Bad Vermillion  mmmmmmmm I'm gonna have to get back to you on this one  
155427,bigbuck,2008-01-29 20:23:00,2449,"Having fished the Muskokas, the Kawartha's and shore fished Lake O, nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing compares to Lake of The Woods. You could quite literally fish every day for the rest of your life there and still not cover all of the little bays, around all the islands, the open water etc... Awesome fishing for walleye, pike, smallmouth bass, lake trout, perch, crappie, whitefish, and did I mention MUSKIE (please remember that all of the aforementioned fish are just  bait for the mighty muskie that reside there). It is gorgeous and there are sheltered bays you can fish without even hearing another boat or seeing another person."
155429,Fishnfiend,2008-01-29 20:28:00,357," Yep, me, too!"
155443,bassmaster4,2008-01-29 21:02:00,801,for me it would either have to be the Grand River or Minisinakwa Lake near timmins
155462,TAH,2008-01-29 21:46:00,133,"At this point I would say 3, Lakair, French River Lodge and the Moon River GB Great fishing and scenery"
155465,highdrifter,2008-01-29 21:54:00,2534,"Lake of the Woods..  Whitefish Bay.  White pelicans, endless shorelines, and the best walleye and smallmouth fishing I've ever experienced!  My happy place.  yyeeeee"
155489,mistaredone,2008-01-29 22:58:00,913,Lake of the woods and I have never been there.
155494,carcham333,2008-01-29 23:06:00,6,i'd go for the Ottawa river.......
155503,Moosebunk,2008-01-29 23:25:00,3970,"Any lake that offers the variety of at least 3 species, with at least one of the species being of trophy size, one of the species coming in phenomenal numbers, and for me at least one has to be a trout specie.  If it did not have those qualities I'd expect great fishing of at least 4 species of fish.  For Ontario...  Nipigon.  A solid four species lake where good numbers of all species can potentially be caught and all of them in trophy sizes.  LOTW offers the same but substitutes the brookies for musky... an almost fair trade.  The Albany or Attawapiskat Rivers.  Walleye, brook trout, trophy pike, sturgeon and whitefish.  Hawley/Sutton Lake/River.  A most underfished gem full of lakers, searun and resident brookies, and totally overlooked big pike and abundant walleye.  Lake Superior or Ontario.  Tonnes of crap.   Across Canada...  I think any trophy northern lake with lake trout, pike and grayling would be perfect.  First choice Great Bear so I could throw in the Tree River and fish the worlds largest arctic char after I get bored of the best lake trout fishing there likely is.  God's Lake/River too in Manitoba.  Pike, walleye, lakers and brookies.  Like Nipigon, my dream combination right there.   To pick only one,  Nipigon."
155507,Canuck2fan,2008-01-29 23:30:00,1444,"I can't pick my favorite spot on account of the Asian Carp probably ruining where I would choose as my only spot before I die..... Damn that makes me sad. So I guess I would have pick my second choice a little bit of bass heaven not far from here. I would be more specific but I would be tripping over too many people from the board there on June 28, 2008 when I get done work."
155518,Hookset,2008-01-30 00:00:00,367,"  Ditto,  From what I've heard + read + watched on T.V. it's got all I'd ever need. As was said previous, it's big enough that you can fish it for a life time and never hit it all.  Creeping farther North to live, farther away from ""civilization"" would be cool too.   Hookset."
155522,outdoorguy61,2008-01-30 00:11:00,220,Fotress Lake in Hamber Provincial Park/BC. It can be googled. Flyin or backpack with brookies being the target species.  outdoorguy61
155529,wallyboss,2008-01-30 00:23:00,1095,Takwata Lake but a bit on the wild side.  Second choice  Lac Seul.
155561,Crazyhook,2008-01-30 01:44:00,1154,FLorida keys for me!
155563,JerseyDog,2008-01-30 02:00:00,190,"The one place in Ontario with basically every native species, clean, wide open water, tricky back bays, small and large tribs with terrain from swampy, rocky, weedy, grassy, sandy to all of the above. And not small, but HUGE - with millions and millions of acres of fishable terrain.  ""320 kilometres long by 80 kilometres wide. It covers over 15,000 square kilometres, making it almost as large as Lake Ontario.""  You guessed it, for me there is no contest - I vote Georgian Bay!"
154989,Casey123,2008-01-29 01:07:00,461,"Just wondering what everyone's favourite body of water to fish is?   If you could only fish one body for the rest of your life, what would it be?   For me, its a tough one, but I would say the Niagara River....  Lots of different species - Lake, Rainbow, Brown Trout  Walley, Pike and Muskie  Smallmouth(some real monsters in the lower river)  You can fish it all year  You never know what is on the end of your line"
154992,walleyeden,2008-01-29 01:12:00,2,"moira lake, great walleye and musky fishing"
154999,lew,2008-01-29 01:19:00,12767,"If I had to narrow it down to one place, I think my choice would be the West Arm of Nippissing.  Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful places anywhere in Ontario."
155004,crappieperchhunter,2008-01-29 01:30:00,2582,"I'd have a hard time narrowing it down to 10 let alone one...but if it had to happen I would choose Simcoe. I fish it 9 months of the year now...June, July and August I'm at the cottage in Bobcaygeon so I fish the Kawartha's in the summer.  Many many good trips on Simcoe over the years...and met alot of good fishing buddies on the water there."
155036,mattyk,2008-01-29 01:54:00,2110,My vote would be for the French River.
155038,Casey123,2008-01-29 01:55:00,461,The |French River Basin would be a close second for me too.
155041,mepps,2008-01-29 01:56:00,1301,"I'll stick with a lake I know well, Jack Lake, Apsley Ontario."
155042,Sinker,2008-01-29 01:56:00,8692,Just one lake? Man.....that's a tough question!  I think I'd take simcoe as well.......but that may change by morning....LOL.  Sinker
155045,irishfield,2008-01-29 01:57:00,26272,If I had to be on just one and some mystical power wouldn't let me leave it's borders... I could fish Fushimi 'till I died. But since that ain't gonna happen....I'll drop onto as many as I can muster in the years to come.
155092,Jigger,2008-01-29 02:42:00,1237,G.Bay. Lots and lots of water to learn. And gosh its pretty up there.  Thats todays answer...
155097,John,2008-01-29 02:49:00,2956,West Arm and Upper French for the fishing. Lower French for the sheer beauty.
155111,gekhunter,2008-01-29 03:00:00,61,I give my vote to Lady Evelyn.  Had some of the best Walleye fishin of my life up there and it has a good up-north-away-from-it-all feel to it.     Greg
155126,krawler,2008-01-29 03:42:00,167,Missinnaibi Lake!!!!!!!
155129,douG,2008-01-29 03:46:00,2693,The next lake I fly in to.
155154,Hooked,2008-01-29 05:18:00,891,"I would probably select Lake of the Woods.  Never been, but has always been a dream of mine to fish it.  Though, it woulda be hard for me to give up Rice Lake, if it weren't for all the tournaments, jet skiers....on it."
155155,danbo,2008-01-29 05:27:00,2646,Great Bear..once
155157,GbayGiant,2008-01-29 05:51:00,1780,Lake X.
155174,solopaddler,2008-01-29 10:01:00,8605, Me too. To be more specific the delta area of the Bad River. Unreal scenery and even better fishing  .
155188,kentooley,2008-01-29 11:48:00,208,It's a secret.
155202,corvette1,2008-01-29 12:28:00,1765,fly-in to the kag
155220,Gerritt,2008-01-29 12:51:00,6129,I would have to vote for the West Arm also.  G
155228,solopaddler,2008-01-29 13:01:00,8605," I've been there twice, once at Leuenberger's lodge, the 2nd time at Timberidge's outpost. Great lake for sure..."
155252,bucktail,2008-01-29 13:54:00,1857,Has to be Nipigon hands down.
155254,cranks bait,2008-01-29 13:59:00,721,"There's a little lake outside of Bancroft that I like to go to every long weekend (wish it could be more).  Great bass fishing, little boat traffic, and awsome company with surrounding cottages."
155255,Rich,2008-01-29 14:03:00,3927,Rice Lake.. cuz then I could at least lock up to the other kawarthas.
