156125,Bernie,2008-01-31 22:05:00,3190,"Was out on the lake yesterday Steve but not fishing. Have heard mixed reports of success. Deeper water is working from what I have heard recently. Bring ice cleats, the lake was void of snow. They are reporting 80% possible flurries tomorrow afternoon so there may be some snow on the lake(if it doesn't get blown away)."
