155983,ccmtcanada,2008-01-31 13:29:00,7971,Update for Southern Ontario....  Get your latest updates here...... http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/son_e.html  City of Toronto 4:47 AM EST Thursday 31 January 2008 Winter storm watch for City of Toronto issued  Another winter storm with significant snow amounts threatening for Friday.  This is an alert to the potential development of dangerous winter weather conditions in these regions. Monitor weather conditions..Listen for updated statements.  Snowsqualls continue to come ashore off of Lake Huron across the Bruce Peninsula then across Georgian Bay into ski country from Orillia and Midland north to near Britt. Local snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are likely this morning along with local whiteout conditions from bursts of heavy snow and occasional blowing snow in the strongest snowsqualls. The snowsqualls are expected to weaken into a few flurries by noon as a high pressure ridge builds in and finally cuts off the brisk westerly winds.  Meanwhile a low pressure area over west Texas is getting organized and setting its sights on southern Ontario. As the low moves east across the southern states then curves northeast towards the Ohio Valley tonight it is expected to tap into alot of moisture and energy from the gulf of Mexico. As a result there is potential for this low to intensify into a significant winter storm as it moves into southern Ontario later tonight and Friday.  Latest indications show the potential for significant amounts of snow from this deepening low as it tracks northeast just south of lakes Erie and Ontario towards New England by Saturday. This type of winter storm often has a swath of 15 to 30 cm of heavy snow associated with it. Freezing rain and ice pellets will also be a problem as the storm centre gets close to the lower Great Lakes. The leading edge of the snow is expected to reach the Windsor and Sarnia areas tonight then spread rapidly northeast across the remainder of the district reaching the Ottawa area Friday morning. Latest analyses suggest the heaviest snow swath may extend from Lake St Clair northeast across the London Kitchener and Golden Horseshoe areas into eastern Ontario including the national Capital region Friday. Ice pellets and freezing rain may also be an issue to contend with generally in regions near and southeast of highway 401. Exact snowfall amounts and the location of ice pellets and freezing rain will depend upon the exact track of this developing storm. It is also possible if the storm centre tracks further north than expected that there could be a changeover to rain Friday especially in areas near eastern Lake Erie.  Travellers should be prepared to alter plans accordingly again as driving conditions once again will deteriorate significantly on Friday.  This storm has the potential to be quite significant and have high impact especially if heavy snow develops. Environment Canada is closely monitoring this situation and will issue warnings later today as needed.  Please refer to the latest public forecasts for further details.

Snow and sleet are preventing them from getting home for their Chinese new year.  That's equal to half the population of the US stranded somewhere on their visit back to their home villages and towns.  Yep, they called in the army to help."
