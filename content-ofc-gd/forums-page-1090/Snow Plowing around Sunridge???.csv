I need to get a spot cleaned out in the drive way, since It hasn't been done yet this year, and can't find anone that does snow removal.  I know there is a company called Gordon Snow Plowing, but I can't find the number.  Does anyone know someone who provides this service in that area?"

I know I can't move our snow bank with my plow truck. Tried on Tuesday to give the river running down the laneway a place to go and managed to put a small dent in it. If you have a large bank in the way a hoe/loader may be the only way to go."
