I'm from Whitby and would like some place other than Scugog or Simcoe. I have an ATV and Clam so am quite mobile, any help would be appreciated. If you can tell me access points, that would be great also.  Tight Lines!!"

155795,John Lutz,2008-01-30 20:35:00,6,"Thanks fishindevil, it's not that I dislike the lake I was just looking foe a change of scenery. Maybe I'll try a different area on Simcoe, I normally stay around Virginia Beach for the perch. Where do you go for whities and trout?"
