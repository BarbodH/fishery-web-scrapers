I've never fished BOQ before and would like to know if anyone knows any Ice bungalow / hut operators out there.  If all else fails to a motel it is.  Cheers."

He picks people up in the morning and takes them out to the huts.  He is better known on this board as Hawg Hunter and he has been a guide on the BOQ for 20+ years during the winter months he is out fishing 7 days a week morning and afternoon, so far to date our customers have iced 271 walleye yes you read that right 271 he have a 98% catch rate and yes you read that right too 98% catch rate!  If you are interested let me know and I can make the arrangements for you.  His price for a heated hut is 100.00 per day and that is for 2 anglers (only 50.00 each).  Hope this is of help to you.  Regards, Sam"
