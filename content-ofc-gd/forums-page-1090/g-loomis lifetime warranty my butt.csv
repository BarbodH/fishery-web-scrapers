153829,corvette1,2008-01-24 12:55:00,1765,aplumma i was the factory on monday no help sent rods back to loomis in the states stores will not take rods back
153830,gbalardo,2008-01-24 13:02:00,20,"I broke one first day in and the fee was waved, but if it's not the rod's fault they won't cover it. even shimano is restricting warranty in 08"
154064,trapshooter,2008-01-25 06:00:00,1234,Croix warranty has been great for me.  Replaced with only shipping charges on all broken rods.
154090,Mark Kulik,2008-01-25 12:37:00,348,Can't go wrong with St.Croix!
154157,corvette1,2008-01-25 17:15:00,1765,thanks guys i think i will try a st.croix
154314,Handlebarz,2008-01-26 13:25:00,3790,If they have a ugly stick i nthe style of rod I know I would be using them. I switched back to them years ago and will do so for a long time they are dependable even if you are hard on equipment like I am it sucked whe nI would break my rods just because of daily use and a nick I would not see I did not like to have $100+ rods sitting in the corner so I switched back. Now my wife bought me a nice musky casting rod from Gander mountain they are made from St Croix blanks and they have a over the counter return policy if I break it just come in no questions asked I get a new one (I might have to pay if they dont have the same one and I up grade but I understand that) I know of a few people here in my area that use the Tournment series from Gander mountain and have exchanged rods. I have been luckey enough to not break it yet.
154320,lew,2008-01-26 13:40:00,12767,"I dunno, but I must be doing something right, cause  I can honestly say that in all the years I've been fishing, I have NEVER had a fishing rod break on me while casting, trolling, hooksets or anything else.  I broke 2 a few years ago when I accidentely knocked an outboard motor over on them in the back of a truck, but never while fishing.  Hopefully my luck continues"
154323,forrest,2008-01-26 14:17:00,1032,"A couple of people have stated that compared to the price of a $230 rod paying $75 is not bad.  So being ripped off moderately is OK?  The guy bought a rod with a ""life-time replacement warranty"" not a ""life-time we will charge you $70 for your next replacement rod warranty""  Lets say your new car broke and the dealer charged you $2000 to fix the 100% under warranty item.  What would you say then then?  forrest"
154345,nofish4me,2008-01-26 16:13:00,404,"I've paid for stuff being shipped recently. I figure for the weight of a rod, $75 bucks will get it on the Space Shuttle! LOL. Although, the length will add some cost.  Darn, still a Minnow."
154361,Markystang,2008-01-26 17:47:00,131,"Believe it or not, a lot of times they do. The call it a ""deductible"".  But your point is well taken and I agree with you totally. Life-time warranty should be exactly that. A 100% free repair or replacement for as long as you own it."
154459,GbayGiant,2008-01-27 03:15:00,1780,"I love my loomis imx rod, it's my favorite rod but I could only afford 1, lol, sometimes you get a dud. One thing that can do that is a nick from anything just tapping or hitting the side of the boat, sometimes you wouldn't even know but that little pressure crack will snap the rod on the next hook set. I could hang a 25lbs dead weight off my medium imx rod out of water, literally. Then again it's hard to justify their prices because there are so many rods that are almost or just as good for half the price and since there mostly 1 pieces the shipping will kill you on a return for warranty issues sometimes it's not even worth it. All that said, at the price they charge it should be no hassle over the counter free replacement.  I had a Fenwick break on me at the 2nd eye last year and asked them if I could break it in half to save shipping and they allowed me to. So instead of $35 it was only $10 to ship and get replaced. Now let's not talk about Canadapost rip-offs."
154495,outllaw,2008-01-27 11:39:00,1232,every rod maker has faults. i prefer my charters choice. tiger rod blanks. i can pick up a 12lb bowling ball with mine. no crinkles or crackling. fiberglass composites are better for trolling. im not a caster. . these rods are in the under 100 category.
154512,Greencoachdog,2008-01-27 14:07:00,8163,"G loomis, Lowrance, Lund... can anybody else think of any other overpriced crap that people waste money on?"
154518,mikeh,2008-01-27 14:58:00,824,"below is the loomis warranty, i'm sure other companies write them the same way. I've heard other companies are getting tougher on their warranties also.

154588,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-27 18:48:00,2585,75 bucks for shipping is way to much!!!!! unless its coming from china itself that is way to much.  CHeers!
154601,irishfield,2008-01-27 20:19:00,26272, I think they were probably billing for this line of the warrantee lbh.. 
154641,PAZE,2008-01-27 22:46:00,132," Name me  better companys, and I'll agree with you."
154842,corvette1,2008-01-28 17:16:00,1765,hade the same trouble with my evinjunk just out of warranty blew a piston evinjunk did not hear about it would not even give a gasket set and i just spent 2300 on a 4 storke trolling motor and evinjunk said thanks for buying evinjunk just like loomis never again if i want a anchor i will buy one sorry for the rant
154892,Kirk,2008-01-28 20:10:00,347,"Our evinrudes been going 30 + years on oil changes and regular maintenance, how did you manage to blow a gasket on a 2003????  Evenrude=EVENGREAT  They've been in business for a million years and you don't do that by selling poor product (or giving away free parts to everyone that trashes their engine)"
155195,corvette1,2008-01-29 12:20:00,1765,it was a 1997-115carb
155312,Kirk,2008-01-29 15:50:00,347,"1997 or 2003 not a big diff, our 9.9 Evinrude is a 1978 my dad's 80hp was also about 30+ years old as well, sold in good working condition, don't know how long it lasted after that.  Those engines are like tanks, unless you got the one in a million lemon which can happen or bad luck when you were using it or someone abused it (never lend a boat).  I've never heard a bad word about them, til now."
155340,corvette1,2008-01-29 17:28:00,1765,"hi kirk it blew 2 power heads and a lowerunit i have 15,000dollars in this junk i did get a lemon"
155422,mikeh,2008-01-29 20:09:00,824,I think the evinrude ficht 150-200 hp motors(1998-2000 pre bombardier) were very poor engines also. somebody from this board warned me about them and after I googled them I found lots of people had problems with them.
155610,carll2,2008-01-30 07:24:00,443,"  il have to agree with you, personally i think quality makes a difference and usually for quality = more expensive.. as an example  while guiding i run a 6 foot st croix and my client is using an ugly stick..why is it that only i feel the lightest bites? quality   so we exchange rods and he too now feels the light bites..so for great performance like that i dont mind paying out"
155677,Kirk,2008-01-30 15:58:00,347,"If its 'just out of warranty' you need to find out if NY or wherever you bought from, has 'implied' statutory warranties, not all states have them.  Implied warranties can cover situations like breakdowns that occur, for example, 3 years and a month after the written 3 year warranty, see if you can get a local lawyer familiar with consumer protection laws to look into it.  It deals with Lemon type of situations.  A letter from a marine mechanic dealing with the cause of the problem might also help you because you will have to deal with the accusation that you might be at fault for having abused it or damged it.  Hope it works out for you."
153441,Guest lundboy,2008-01-23 12:33:00,0,"If Shimano now owns them you can expect it won't be long before the rods are made in China.  It's almost impossible now to find anything that isn't.  Shimano reels used to be made in Japan, this year (2008) they are made in Malaysia (including the Stella).  All of their rods for the past 5 years have been coming out of china.  Even US-Reels are made in....  CHINA!  Only reels still made in the US are Ardent.  Only rods (I can find) that are made in the US are St. Croix.  So,  you don't neccessarily get what you pay for.  $250 rod from USA, cost is probably $160.  $250 rod made in China, cost is probably $30.   This is probably why they break easy on a hook set.  Berkley rods have gone down hill big time this year.  I have a Berkley Series One (made in USA) from 1988 that still fishes great and has not suffered from any failures what-so-ever, same with a Shimano Beastmaster from same era, that has hauled in huge pike and bass.  Yet I have had to replace more recent rods for guide and handle failures that were 3 years old or less and out of warranty that were in the $150 price range.... made in China of course."
153443,corvette1,2008-01-23 12:51:00,1765,thanks for all your replies just had to vent guess i will look at the upcoming fishing shows
153778,jjcanoe,2008-01-24 02:50:00,744,I've sent a number of Berkly lightning rods back for replacement for only the cost of a few $$$ worth of stamps on the box. They were replaced no questions asked  jjcanoe
153820,aplumma,2008-01-24 12:03:00,6896,You might try dealing directly with G loomis and get better results. The place were you bought it has already gotten their profit out of the transaction and will only lose money if they use manpower to keep you happy. They don't feel that you hold them responsable because they blamed the return policy on the vendor/manufacture.   Art
