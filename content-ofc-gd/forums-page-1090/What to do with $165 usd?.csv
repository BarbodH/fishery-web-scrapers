155833,JerseyDog,2008-01-30 23:25:00,190,"I won $165 usd in my Dead Pool.  Since the money has bad karma, I thought I should just spend it on something I wouldn't usually buy for myself instead of paying bills or buying more RRSP's or something else so responsible.  After all, the last thing I want is my RRSP to have bad karma.  Anyway, I've been struggling for the last couple of days so I thought I'd ask OFC.  Does anyone have any thoughts about the perfect gift to oneself for no more than $165 usd?"
155834,Roy,2008-01-30 23:27:00,13728,Is that kinda like $165 CAD?  Take your sweetie for a nice meal...money in the bank.
155835,Greencoachdog,2008-01-30 23:28:00,8163,Take it to the casino.  Take your wife or girlfriend out to a nice dinner.  Don't buy fishin gear with it!!!
155840,walleyejigger,2008-01-30 23:49:00,876,"not sure what a dead pool is but, if u didn't put much money if any into the pool, u could turn into good karma in the form of a donation to a good cause,  but since you're lookin for something less responsible  buy somethin u wouldn't normally buy yourself or a loved one  if it were me, as said already a nice ""overdue"" diner with the girlfriend or buddy  would get it  WOOOOOHOOOOOO post #1000 for me"
155847,aplumma,2008-01-31 00:03:00,6896,you could always send it to some one who uses USD daily.......  Art from USA
155850,solopaddler,2008-01-31 00:10:00,8605,"I'd probably take my wife out to dinner, that's a pretty good suggestion. Or maybe donate it to the fishing for Tyler fundraiser that OFC is organising.."
155854,tbayboy,2008-01-31 00:28:00,1497,Does nobody waste money on hookers and booze anymore?
155897,OhioFisherman,2008-01-31 01:34:00,6623,Like 100 Canadian? Spend it quick! It may be worth less soon!

155903,danbouck,2008-01-31 01:37:00,4380,You could always send it my way    But since that aint gonna happen I say go out for a nice dinner or buy a new rod and reel and catch a nice dinner.
155910,mufasa001,2008-01-31 01:57:00,37,Go treat yourself to some fun at the local rub-&-tug.
155912,Fang,2008-01-31 02:03:00,1330,"buy another beagle, Malcolm pups are starting to open their eyes  Honestly pay yourself first  $165 can give one a bit of piece of mind and relaxation in this hectic world. Whatever it takes to put a smile on your face - be it a case of Stella or new lures but don't forget to try and put a smile on someones elses too! Makes the day better."
155924,Gerritt,2008-01-31 02:29:00,6129,Jersey dog.. use it to make a little boys day... infact more then one day..  Bid on the early bird items for Tyler.  NBA tickets still waiting to be bid on...  Know that you $$ is going to a good cause.. helping a kid that is special and requires some special friends to help him along.  One good turn deserves another...  G.
155946,Hooked,2008-01-31 03:56:00,891,"Well, I've had my eye on the Fin-nor Megalite spinning reel.  Thats pretty close to 165, plus, you can let me know if its worth buying for myself."
155947,FishFinder,2008-01-31 03:58:00,481,send it to a starving student (me)

156003,Beans,2008-01-31 14:38:00,3339,"Ya...What Gerritt said !...  If'n the money has bad karma, do you really want to pass it on to a fishing rod ?  Skunk city every time you use it..."
