155763,Canuck2fan,2008-01-30 18:35:00,1444," I agree with everyone saying they should date stamp the line...... I remember when Trilene changed the packaging about 2 yrs ago. I still see some stores selling the old package with the bass on the front so at least a person knows to avoid that line. Otherwise though it is almost impossible to tell how old line is, mainly because it could be a year old before a store even gets it."
155501,Canuck2fan,2008-01-29 23:17:00,1444, I AGREE!!!!! Anybody with any experience in receiving packages knows for a fact that to every delivery service's teenage employee that a fragile sticker means DROP KICK that package like you are going for a field goal from the 20 yd line to win the Stupor Bowl..... I have seen it at all the terminals and talked to employees from all three of the major shippers and I have to steel myself to order stuff online but I still do it from time to time... But I sure wouldn't order any rod worth more than 30 bucks LOL.

155586,Rizzo,2008-01-30 03:20:00,4754,"save your energy for bigger battles.  Not sure any breakage on 4 lb test could be considered ""inappropriate"".  I figure stuff like that breaks if you look at it funny."
155607,Big Cliff,2008-01-30 06:38:00,6899,"I use a lot of 4 & 6 lb test for walleye fishing and last year decided to try Berkley's Transition. I wasn't very pleased with the product, I found it broke very easily and tangled a lot more easily than the mono lines so I contacted them and explained my concerns. They were very quick to respond and sent me some technical information about the line which pretty much confirmed what I had been experiencing with the product. Then I got an email from their Canadian distributor asking me to phone him directly. It took many tries before I actually got to talk with him but after reviewing everything with him he asked for my address and a few days later a new spool of line showed up. It wasn't the transitions but it was the vanish. I tried it but found that while it wasn't quite as bad I still prefered the mono I had been using and switched back to that.  I really think you should give the name of the manufacturer good or bad and I do think you should persue this further, it isn't about the cost of a spool of line it's about feedback on a product. If they get enough feedback good or bad it will help them developing/supplying better quality products. If they aren't interested in doing that then we will know to avoid their products."
