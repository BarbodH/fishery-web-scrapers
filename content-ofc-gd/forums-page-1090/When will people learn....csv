155222,ccmtcanada,2008-01-29 12:54:00,7971,"Pretty scary stuff!!  Did I hear that right? Open water on Monday, and people sledding on Tuesday?"
155223,Sinker,2008-01-29 12:55:00,8692,"Ummm.......never.....they'll never learn.  Monkey see, monkey do.......if there are tracks on the lake......others will follow. I'm sure we'll hear more stories like this before the end of the week!!  Sinker"
155227,pikehunter,2008-01-29 12:59:00,1659,Never.  Thin ice and idiots are kind of like trailer parks in the tornado belt. Idiots are drawn to it like tornadoes are drawn to trailer parks.
155233,Greencoachdog,2008-01-29 13:09:00,8163,Idiots will never learn... that's why they're idiots!!!
155248,Meely,2008-01-29 13:49:00,282,"Reminds me  an episode of The Little Rascals where Spanky and Scotty are watching the ""Grown Ups"" ...... Scotty says to Spanky........""They'll Never Learn"".......Guess it still holds true all these years later...!!  Meely"
155277,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-29 14:47:00,0,"The video was from last (Friday) . Is it safe? NO! Obviously not.  The ice there froze over last Monday. We checked the ice Wednesday, the day before the guy went through(thursday). We only made it out a few feet before we descided to NOT GO!! Went to innisfil Beach instead where another guy went through just passed where we walked out to . The ice went from 5"" to 1"" in only a few paces. I can see going if you check first but some think that because it has been frozen for a whole week that its OK to walk and sled on.   Well it isnt!!!!! There were at least a dozen guys out there this weekend WALKING   and Sledding!!!  I wouldn't walk out there with out a spud......... checking the whole way out.  Hmmm Salvage rights............going there on friday morning.   WALKING OUT!!... Must bring a chainsaw ,rope and ladder with me."
155281,Jen,2008-01-29 14:57:00,833," Bring some gas, some fuel stablilizer and a dry towel to wipe her down when you get her out... LOL...  Wouldn't it be nice... ??LOL  Bet that snowmobile owner is a little sad today... and in his defense, we all make choices and sometimes they don't turn out so well... An idiot, nah, an adventurer maybe!  Cheers  Jen"
155284,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-29 15:03:00,0,Nahh..  ..Ill send a video to the news station showing it up on its end draining ..........then show it running around ON SHORE after we start her up.
155331,fishindevil,2008-01-29 17:13:00,6254,"Well its the same thing every year,people will not wait till its safe and they will continue to risk their lives,all for a day of snowmobiling !!!! it tells you how smart they are and how they pay attention to warnings & ignore safety..."
155337,sharper,2008-01-29 17:21:00,279, The sled will still run after it's been in the water like that???
155342,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-29 17:30:00,0,Yup! No problem. Just have to know what to do is all.
155347,Bernie,2008-01-29 17:35:00,3190,"Even on Nipissing there are areas to avoid. Talked to a fella who was out near where the South River enters the lake and he said there was only 4 inches. Thats even after the solid cold we had for a few days. I checked out in front of my place and there was a good solid 12"". On the main lake there is 12 to 16"". There were pickups going everywhere. I don't think they were too wise going off the main trails where the snow was compacted allowing the cold to penetrate the snow."
155370,Joey,2008-01-29 18:29:00,9122,"Unfortunately, there's no cure for stupid!!!"
155442,icedude,2008-01-29 21:01:00,459,  good line -there is too much truth in that logic!  Hugs and kisses to Elly Mae--and i mean that in the nicest way  Cheers!   ID1
155449,misfish,2008-01-29 21:11:00,29133,Do I get royalties for this pic????????????

155469,irishfield,2008-01-29 22:00:00,26272,"Ya know... sooner or later every one of these ""idot"" threads melts down and folks end up with pie in their face !"
155557,holdfast,2008-01-30 01:26:00,1813,"Hey lets look at the positive side.  He lost his sled.  We saved a few tax dollars as he made it out.  OPP divers will have supper with their families, and, now he can get a handicapped sign as he has proven that he is mentally disabled."
155565,JerseyDog,2008-01-30 02:13:00,190,"I need to agree with Irishfield.  With due respect, I can't imagine that no one on this fishing board, with so many active members, has never ventured out on new ice, or had thier leg break through, or fallen in, or had their sled sink or whatever other stupid things that occasionally kill some unlucky folks.  That guy was maybe being an idiot, but we are all idiots sometimes.  Most of us just never make the news."
155568,Mike the Pike,2008-01-30 02:39:00,3421,its all so scary but I really hope there are no more deaths
