155309,Garyv,2008-01-29 15:47:00,547,"AIN'T IT THE TRUTH!!?   Joe Smith started the day early having set his alarm clock (MADE IN JAPAN ) for 6am. While his coffeepot (MADE IN CHINA ) was perking, he shaved with his electric razor (MADE IN HONG KONG ). He put on a dress shirt (MADE IN SRI LANKA ), designer jeans (MADE IN SINGAPORE ) and tennis shoes (MADE IN KOREA ) After cooking his breakfast in his new electric skillet (MADE IN INDIA ) he sat down with his calculator (MADE IN MEXICO ) to see how much he could spend today. After setting his watch (MADE IN TAIWAN ) to the radio (MADE IN INDIA ) he got in his car (MADE IN GERMANY ) filled it with GAS (from Saudi Arabia ) and continued his search for a good paying CANADIAN JOB. At the end of yet another discouraging and fruitless day checking his Computer (Made In Malaysia ), Joe decided to relax for a while. He put on his sandals (MADE IN BRAZIL ) poured himself a glass of wine (MADE IN FRANCE ) and turned on his TV (MADE IN INDONESIA ), and then wondered why he can't find a good paying job in CANADA ..."

155322,Tybo,2008-01-29 16:43:00,1373,Which the north American market jack a 600% profit off all the items. Why Joe Smith needs the well paying job.
155358,fatherof3,2008-01-29 17:51:00,1769,very true
155384,pikehunter,2008-01-29 18:54:00,1659,"I've been saying that for a long, long time. Everything is imported. Us North Americans are    for letting this happen.  Too many available jobs are now in retail, pays crap and you have to earn a living trying to sell all the s%$t made everywhere else.  Fibreglass entry doors are coming onto the market really strong and will soon replace steel doors as the #1 choice. Every FG door comes from China, (and sell for a higher margin) many of the fancy glass door inserts also come from offshore. The wood door jambs, yep they too also come from China in particular the preprimed ones. Of course the assemblers make it sound like they are all made here. Nope, only put together on this continent. Soon there will be no manufacturing jobs left in Canada."
155388,fishing,2008-01-29 18:57:00,167,I am driving North American cars.
155404,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-29 19:28:00,957,Are North American companies going offshore to seek lower taxation and lower wages?  Or are North American companies being forced offshore by extremely high taxes and extremely high wages?  We might try being friendlier to companies that provide jobs.
155411,BITEME,2008-01-29 19:42:00,1969,THIS poop HAS TO STOP!!!!!!!!!!
155448,Casey123,2008-01-29 21:08:00,461,Couldn't have said it better myself.
155535,Hookset,2008-01-30 00:28:00,367,"I like the post...  The truth hurts don't it ? It's ok though cuz' in a hundred years or so, Canadians and Americans will be so broke, we'll be the ones working for pennies and all the lost business will come running back  Just wonder which countries will step up and try keeping the Lid on this Planet (i.e. Terrorism, Disease, Foreign Aid, Hunger etc.) when North Americans (and some E.U. Countries too) are too broke to do so ?  But to listen to some Human Beans, we're the cause of everything bad anyway right ? Damned if you do...  Thank God we have an on-ice bungalow booked for this weekend, no one can hear you rant from there lol. I just noticed...3 of my ice rods are made in China...guilty  .   Hookset."
155612,Dano,2008-01-30 10:40:00,719,Good thing he bought all that stuff when his union job was paying him $40/hr to install wheel lugs on cars no one wanted.
155640,Fang,2008-01-30 13:43:00,1330,Sounds Like Joe only shops at Walmart
155715,fish_finder,2008-01-30 17:07:00,370," WOW I'm surprised it took so long for that to come out!!  Consumers have buying power, believe it or not!  You take the cheap way out, you make a mess down the road.  Some poor schlep across the ocean far far away makes next nothing for all of those wonderful things we all love to buy...useless or not!  Whoever makes the purchase makes the decision...you wanna change it??? Have a peek at your own buying habits and see just what you are pushing along!!"
155721,Puckhead,2008-01-30 17:10:00,377, Exactly...
155732,Deano,2008-01-30 17:44:00,767,"And to add to all that, all our resources are becoming owned by foreign companies. With the natural resources in Canada, we should have no taxes, the profits from our resources would be more than enough to keep us a rich nation, but to make a quick buck, everything is sold out and a few live the high life. And the countries buying all our resources are getting richer from it, allowing them to keep buying more."
