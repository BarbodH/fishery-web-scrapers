155727,reelinrolly,2008-01-30 17:39:00,281,"I got out last night for a little walleye fishing on the Sydenham river, just east of Wallaceburg!!  Caught this little guy on a rattlin bluefox spoon!!!    Tasted pretty good too!!    The ice was very sketchy, ranging anywhere from 1"" - 4""  So if you go out, be very careful!!!"
