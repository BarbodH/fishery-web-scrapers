231375,CRAPPIE,2008-07-23 00:41:00,213,Does anyone know Lebaron sells Senko and what colors they got  Thanks
231380,BabyHerc,2008-07-23 00:47:00,285,They do not sell Senkos.
231446,e-z-out,2008-07-23 01:56:00,1052,Not at this time but after speaking to one of the sales guys they might try to carry the senko for next year.
231460,Garry2Rs,2008-07-23 02:35:00,1425,"Yum and Zoom are just as good, and might even last longer. Senkos are very high in salt and tear very easily."
231545,Victor,2008-07-23 11:21:00,1609,"are you looking for the ""original"" senko? or just something similar?  Lebaron carries their own line of soft plastics, they've got like, tubes, lizards, worms .. and they do have something that looks like a senko. I have been using that and have caught a few rockies with some largies. For around $2.50 a pack it's much cheaper than the real stuff."
231590,Oktravis,2008-07-23 13:05:00,62,you should try jb`s fishing depot.they have a wall of them.lots of different colours    travis
231601,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-23 13:29:00,2050," I agree that Yum Dinger's last longer, but only because they don't catch fish! lol  I'm sure it's just the body of water I fish, but for whatever reason they don't eat dingers...at all! Which sucks because they're cheaper, and you're right, Senko's fall apart after a couple good bites."
231625,fishinggeek,2008-07-23 14:56:00,325,"Dingers have been great for me, and LeBaron's carries them.  If you're set on Senko's, LeBaron's doesn't carry them (at least for now).  I know JB's and BPS both carry Senkos, but I'm not sure which is the cheaper one."
231626,young_one,2008-07-23 15:01:00,620,"I find the Mizmo senko works better than Yum Dinger, and Lebaron has it. It has more salt and weights more."
231647,bassjnkie,2008-07-23 16:07:00,1101,"JB's fishing depot has a great selection of senko's, here's the # 416-614-7222"
231667,Pachone,2008-07-23 17:31:00,276,"went to LEBS last week... picked up some YUM DINGERS 5 INCH, in the orka purple... worked like a charm... and its same thing as senkos."
