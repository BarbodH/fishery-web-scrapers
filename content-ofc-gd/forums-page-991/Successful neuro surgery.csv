231404,jwl,2008-07-23 01:12:00,1056,"all the best to a totally successful recovery,I just went through that sort of thing with my Mom back just after Christmas of 2007..she had a small stroke at home..woke up in the morning kind of feeling ""funny"" so she called my Aunt to run her to the hospital, and upon doing some tests they confirmed that she had a small stroke, but then got the worse news when the doctors said I wouldn't worry about that,  would worry about the anuerism(sp??).  After I took her to the specialist for some tests it was decided it was best to do a preventative surgery and have the anuerism clipped.   The docs where amazing, kept the family well informed every step of the way the day of surgery, and after about a 2 week stay in hospital, and some recovery at home, I am happy to say that everything went fine and she had a full recovery...she just actually went today for some follow up test results and was given a big A+ from the doctors.  I wish your family the same, and have a safe happy rest of the summer"

231241,lew,2008-07-22 20:32:00,12767,"My wife has recentely had some very serious, very scary, but extremely successful neuro surgery and she got home from the hospital today and everything is 100% and the neuro-surgeon says she'll make a total recovery in no time.  He wants Diane to relax, do nothing & enjoy her ""vacation"" for the next 6 weeks while everything heals so were heading off to the trailer tomorrow morning about 9:00 AM and except for a couple mini trips back here to the city, we'll be gone till after Labor Day  We have to come down next Friday so she can get 30 steel staples removed from her head and then we'll head north again right after that.  As long as Diane is doing well, I'm heading to Lakair in Mid August for a week of musky fishing, then possibly another trip to the Ottawa River but other than that I'll be hanging around the Kawartha region.    .........On a side note, I find the skill of a surgeon  truly amazing and what some of these surgeons can do is absolutely unbelievable, specially the guys who can repair something as complex as a brain, and I really have to wonder why they're payed about 1/10th as much as a 20 year old kid in the NHL, but that's a topic for another day."
