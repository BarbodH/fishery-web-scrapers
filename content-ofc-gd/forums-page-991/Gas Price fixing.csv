I knew that when in Angus on a Rumor of Toronto having a price increase of 15 cents I watched buddy put his price up as I was in line.  When I asked him why he said he had a phone call from the District manager.  Funny thing though I watched Mr Greedy running the pumps the whole time.  Are they still doing it? you Betcha"
