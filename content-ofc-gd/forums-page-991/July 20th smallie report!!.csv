231211,fishindevil,2008-07-22 19:13:00,6254,Nice fish !!!!  Man that last shot is pretty close to the top of the falls dont ya think !!!
231455,jwl,2008-07-23 02:17:00,1056,"  first off great fishin man, I love that spot, some days can be pretty crusher there eh walleyemen   It's not really all that close as you would think..and before ya ever actually went over the brink of the falls...there is some white bouy markers out on the water, and if your boat crosses those, the coastguard will be all over you like 90...and it's possible they are going to slap a $10,000 fine on you too for crossing the line."
231518,walleyemen,2008-07-23 09:24:00,316,"Jack is so right! Cross that magic line or those bouys and the calvary comes a running,sure makes for a great elusion though, in actual fact it's about 2 or 3 kms, on the water it just looks closer!"
