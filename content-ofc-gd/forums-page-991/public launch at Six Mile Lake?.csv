231098,wmshaw,2008-07-22 15:28:00,42,There are no free launches.   Six Mile Lake Provincial Park has an excellent ramp and good parking and you can get a day pass.  Bill
231118,Rizzo,2008-07-22 16:30:00,4754,I second 6 mile provincial park. I've caught bass casting right from the launch before putting the boat in!
231124,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-22 16:48:00,0,I launched at Six mile lake marina if I am not mistaken and I don't recall paying anything....I don't even think it was open. But it was around 7am.
