THEN, when we're supposed to be coming down slowly, after all the heavy breathing with those fish....you drop the Hell's Gate / Thunderhouse pics on us?  I was almost in tears -- stopped breathing for a minute, no question. Thanks for sharing!!!!!"

Excellent writing and great pics;  from James Bay muskeg, arrival at camp, non-stop big walleye and pike, the departure, to great pics of Hells Gate/ Thunderhouse Falls,  all quality and quantity. You should get paid by Field and Stream, OOD, etc... for this great stuff. Thanks for taking all the time creating this post. ehg"

225169,ccmtcanada,2008-07-09 00:43:00,7971,"Wow...chalk up yet another chapter in ""The Many Fishing Adventures of The Mighty Moosebunk""!!!  I would have replied earlier, but I find I like to set up with a coffee in one hand, the children in bed, and no TV on so I can read every word uninterrupted.  This report had me riveted!!!  I have never seen so many big pike in one report before.  The walleye were gorgeous as well. I loved the ""about 2 weeks"" thing...LOL.  What a great adventure....I can only hope to catch just a glimpse of the kinds of fishing trips that you go on!  Thanks for that....must have taken hours to compose that report...appreciate the effort!!"

224327,John,2008-07-07 14:53:00,2956,Amazing as always Drew. A trip like that makes putting up with the 'squito's bearable.
224334,glen,2008-07-07 15:03:00,2641,That was awesome.
224350,limeyangler,2008-07-07 15:19:00,5204,"Absolutely AMAZING REPORT!!!! those piuctures are icredible!!!! dont know why but apart from the fish pics...my favourite is the close-up of the beetle. What camera do you use?   once again, great report, thanks for sharing."
224351,Tacklebuster,2008-07-07 15:20:00,303,Another fine treat provided by you.  The pics of Thunderhouse Falls and Hell Gate are amazing.  The first explorers must have been sh*@!$ their pants when they first saw that.

I forget about the text, and just look at the pictures, whatever they are, of fish or scenery. Both are awesome as usual. Kinda like reading Playboy (it does have good articles in it, HONEST!!), when you are 16 yrs. old,   :lol:  :lol:  Thanks for making me drool, again."
224458,solopaddler,2008-07-07 19:03:00,8605,"Amazing, unbelievable, fantastic report! Incredible number of large pike, and you're right, the size of the walleyes are astounding for that far north!  (I feel sick to my stomach now, man I wish I could have joined you, but I just couldn't swing it  . I think I know where I'm going next year though  .)"
224463,wallyboss,2008-07-07 19:10:00,1095,"Thanks MB for another good adventure!!  I always read your posts twice. First I start reading then as soon as I see a pictures I scroll down aagain and again, by the 4th picture I completely forget that there is a story attached to it , so I looke at all teh pictures and then start the whole thing again."
