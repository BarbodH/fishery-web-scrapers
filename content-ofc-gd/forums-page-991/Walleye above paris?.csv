Is this normal for this stretch of river? I was fishing the Glen Morris - Paris Stretch. I also had what I figured was a pike break me off. Lots of small Bass a couple hit the 17"" mark but nothing over."

231120,Jaymerica,2008-07-22 16:41:00,12,I am going to Thunder Bay for 2 weeks (Lots of fishing) lol but when I return I am going to try some live bait in some of these deep holes in the grand. I have always just floated by giving a few casts with a tube. I bet if I were to spend some fishing the holes I would be surprised on what I might catch! The Grand River is only 5 min. from home so I really should spend more time on it.
