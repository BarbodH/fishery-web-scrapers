Not to much new for me except for my origional Fishing Snakes, im goin to give them a third try during my tourny in a few weeks. They worked good there in the start of the season caught 2 nice fish in a hour of fishing up at lake scugog, than a little guy the other week."

Guy is actually local and runs a charter service out of the Niagra region. I have been having alot of success with them. Soft plastics. I love the new Baits from Set the Hook and the New ones from Bass magnet lures. Soft swimbaits are producing for me. I recently discovered bass magnet lures and have ben liking what I see so far.  Last but certinally not least, my favorite drop shot bait is Mark Kuliks slammers and gobies."
