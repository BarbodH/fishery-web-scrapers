You will not be fishing and may not necessarily be in our boat, but you do get a free day on a boat, a bag of goodies and a chance to learn some great techniques for salmon fishing from some of the best Anglers on the lake.  You will need to be at Bluffers Park by 6am on the day, we will be off the water by 3pm. You will also need to be available at 7.00pm the friday evening before the tournament for the Captain and Spotters meeting, this will be held at the Dogfish Pub at Scarborough Bluffs. The beers are on me  Tightline Shootout website: http://enticerlures.com/Shootout/index.htm  Please PM me ASAP if you are interested in participating as a Spotter.  If you're not interested in being a Spotter but maybe looking for something to pass the time that day everyone is welcome to come and watch the weigh-in. I have a feeling that there will be some BIG Salmon coming to the scales again this year.  Cheers, Shaun"
