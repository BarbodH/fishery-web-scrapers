But with baby Limeyangler on the way and another job offer just in I will be working 3 jobs come September so better get all the fishing in now ......cuz somehow even living on the lake i don’t think i will have much time to fish. Anyhoooooo...enough of the biography....lol back to the report.   Went out on Friday on Wabigoon for a couple of hours in the evening to check out a few reefs for walleye, really nice evening but only a few walleye on the reefs...only little guys too   A FEW OF THESE AROUND      I did get a couple of nice pike though, they really put up a good scrap in the shallow warm water. I was fishing a reef with a thumper jig with those little rattle attachments with a live minnow, the reef is surrounded by 20-30 fow and is shallow enough to loose your skeg on across the top, all the fish came in 5 FOW.    THESE GUYS PUT UP A DECENT FIGHT  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1362.flv"">    NOT AS BIG AS THE FIRST BUT STILL FUN when they 'CATCH SOME AIR DUDE'  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1396.flv"">    I decided to head of to my favourite little island reef closer to home for the sunset bite...but after five minutes this huge storm cloud appeared directly above me...everywhere else was still clear skies lol.....so...decided it was best to not get ZAPPED for the sake of a few fish and headed back.   STORM CLOUD, SUN AND RAIN AT SUNSET       DEFINITELY TIME TO MOVE....LOL     I did a slow troll along the shore in front of the house with a worm harness tipped with minnow along the weed beds but only one small sauger, the storm cloud was now way off but was taking no chances and hugging as close to shore as possible....did come across a couple of ducks though, cool to watch the whole family   WAIT FOR ME MUM!!!!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1413-1.flv"">   Was working Saturday day and night but had planned to go back to Grassy Bay again Sunday with the same buddies, this time Chuck brought his partner Amber and Mel brought his wife Sandra along, so there was more swearing than usual going on .....lol. Grassy Bay is near Sioux Lookout ,and is part of the Lac Seul chain of lakes. We had stumbled upon Grassy Bay by accident as we could not get into another lake last week because it would have needed ATVs to do so, but this bay was smoking hot for Walleye, and difficult to get fish not in or over slot to keep.  To get there you take the logging roads, and on the previous trip we saw lots of small cuts in the bush heading towards lots of other small lakes...gonna get to them all one day!!!! We also went across a culvert last week and joked that there were probably good fish right there...so this time Mel's boy Pat insisted we stop and try, we did and only Pat fished, he did not get anything but we were agreed there were probably fish there , and we were all agreed we would have to put the small boats in there one day and see where the large creek flowed to, probably another walleye sweet spot!   STOPPED AT THE CULVERT ALONG THE WAY       IT WAS REALLY SUCKING THE WATER ON ONE SIDE       NO FISH THIS TIME BUT WE GOTTA FIND OUT WHERE THAT CREEK RUNS TO      After around 10 minutes at the culvert we headed off to arrive 20 minutes later at the bridge crossing Grassy Bay. Chuck got our boat in in under 5 mins, but at last i found someone who is worse at reversing trailers than even me LOL....but Mel got there in the end.......     SORRY MEL, YOU""RE EVEN WORSE AT THAT THAN ME......AND I""M BAD!      We all headed towards the weed bed we did well at last time and threw in the marker even before we had caught a fish, bad move as not a bite for half an hour with six rods out. At this point the group split and we headed round the other side of the bay following the shoreline. Between the three of us we had around 4 small jack fish and Chuck caught the first walleye of the day. I did not take any pictures because by this time the skies had opened up and it rained solidly for the next 2 hours.   After the first hour we realised that Mel had gone to the very shallow end of the bay and had not re-emerged for that whole time. We figured he must have found the fish so crept in there to see what was going on.......As we rounded the corner there they were, and they were casting furiously.....as soon as young Pat saw us he started yelling, ""there here!!!! everywhere....hundreds of them!!!"" . Well hundreds is a slight exaggeration but they had 5 on the stringer and had had to throw a few slot size back too.      AS WE ROUNDED THE POINT THERE THEY WERE AND THIS TIME MEL FOUND THE EYES       It was only about 3-4' deep at the end of the bay, full of weed and sunken logs but that’s where the walleye were. We had all been using little Joe walleye spinner type rigs with minnows, and on my first cast i managed to avoid all the weed and obstacles and this guy nailed it right by the boat........     NICE WALLEYE......SHAME ABOUT THE FASHION SENSE       Amber was the next to strike....she had decided to drop a pink and whit 'knuckle head' jig right over the side of the boat tipped with a minnow. She got a bit carried away ...lol....decided to kiss the fish...oh well...what ever tickles your turtle!     IS THIS WHY THEY CALL IT FISH PORN?       Chuck was not having much luck, and neither was i after that first one, casting out spinners with the weight set 30"" up the line into weed and deadheads was not the easiest way to fish this area......Chuck and i got a few of these to prove that........    PUT IT BACK CHUCK.......ITS IN THE SLOT!      I decided to change up to a slip bobber with a few beads and a small spinner blade above a smallish Aberdeen hook set at 2.5' deep, so i could just drop it into holes in the weed, again first cast and wham......second cast....wham.........third cast a small perch......and fourth and fifth cast another walleye. I set Chuck up on bobber and he too started to pull them in, much to the annoyance of Mel who had stopped catching and was yelling over....""we found 'em, go get your own""....a bit ungenerous we thought...since last time there we found the fish and put Mel onto them...so we kept our replies short and sweet.....""$%$#@#$% MEL!"" lol........all in good humour of course.  We all got a few but only managed 6 keepers due to big and in slot fish......not many pictures cuz of the rain but here's a few....     NOT KISSING THIS ONE AMBER?        CHUCK GETTING IN ON THE FISH PORNOGRAPHY ACTION        DIFFUCULT TO GET KEEPERS.......BUT THIS ONE WILL DO NICELY CHUCK       OUR FINAL KEEPER TALLY FOR THE DAY....GOOD SIZE FISH THOUGH AND ENOUGH FOR A FRY UP!             On Monday i again headed out for a few hours in the evening, this time my wife joined me, although she did not want to fish, just sunbathe as the sun had made an appearance at last!!!! I wanted to go into Contact Bay which is about 20 mins away from our shore but i had never ventured into it as i always tend to go the other way and head to Mile and Trap lakes........I added this map piccy so people can get the idea of where i am...i have marked reefs with red dots...who knows it might come in handy if ya are ever up this way.......     WABIGOON LAKE     We stopped at the 2 reefs central to the channel before you come to Contact Bay, as these can hold some nice walleye. I was not fishing for food, just catch and release as i am beginning to overdose on fish fries. Anyway..... i did get a couple of smallish walleye here, but again the jackfish were biting more. So we headed down into contact bay and stopped at the first island we came to. Straight away i could see on the Lowrance that it was full of baitfish with the odd large fish arch showing up, i did get a couple of walleye, but the pike were again in numbers here......one of which i actually think was a tiger stripe/hybrid musky...it was way to clearly striped to be a plain old Northern.....unfortunately it unhooked itself before a pic could be taken but did get the initial run on video....anyway here's some pics from Monday......     I'M PRETTY SURE THIS WAS A SMALL TIGER MUSKY...I SAY BUGGER WHEN IT GETS OFF>>>SORRY IF IT OFFENDS   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1461.flv"">      A COUPLE OF THE SMALL WALEYE WE CAUGHT             THIS PIKE HAD A BIG FISH IN ITS BELLY......IN THE SECOND PICTURE YOU CAN JUST SEE THE FIN STICKING UP ITS THROAT   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1451-1.flv"">               MUST GET A NEW NET.......CUZ THIS IS NOT HOW TO LAND A FISH  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1455.flv"">    Tuesday i headed out again at about 4pm. I wanted to try the worm spinners along the large weed beds i had seen the day before at the bottom end of Contact Bay, i never got that far and am kinda glad i did not in the end. I headed out and again stopped at the 2 midwater reefs before the entrance to Contact Bay. Not any Jackfish there to day, and very few fish on the sonar but i did get this nice walleye...     NICE EATING SIZE....I JUST CANT FACE EATING ANY FISH FOR A WHILE THOUGH....LOL  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1467.flv"">    I did not spend too much time here and headed round the corner to Contact Bay. Like i said i planned to head to the very end of the bay and fish the weed beds to see if the walleye were hiding in there, I’m trying to practice walleye fishing at the moment. Instead i ended up trolling the whole shoreline (left hand side on the above map) from the entrance to Contact Bay, might as well do it now, see what’s there...so i know for future reference.......anyway....only a few small sauger and a Jackfish until i got almost level with the island i had fished the day before. I was in the little bay for about 2 hours, and the whole time i was there, mostly spinning for walleye, fish...large fish, were breaking the surface, so i tried a surface popper, and mepps spinner. after about an hour i finally got a small rock bass, it was none to pleased to be caught and was trying to pee on me ..........     THAT'LL TEACH YA TO CATCH ME......EEEEWWW.....FISH PEE       I did get another follow, and it looked decidedly like a smallie....but although i knew there were smb in the main body of lake Wabigoon, I’d never got one so just put it down to the 'wannasees'. I gave up on the lure tactics after an hour and started the walleye trolling again, i hit one spot right at the point of the small bay where i was marking a lot of fish, but it was snag heaven and very difficult to get a run without getting snagged....sooo....i did what i tried at Grassy Bay a couple of days before and put the bobber on....almost as soon as the bobber settled...it went under and i got this guy....     CHANGE OF TACTICS PROVED FRUITFUL      That was it for walleye, did not get another bite on the bobber. I decided to give lures one last shot before heading home. I had no luck with the top water so opted for the Mepps spinner. I cast for 20 mins or so without a nibble so opted for a Blue Fox hardbait/spinner combo thingy. I chucked it at some weed and rock right up against the shoreline....before i had even reeled in one turn the line went tight and i felt a good weight behind it. I was just thinking jackfish, until a big bass took flight....OMG.......A BASS.....ON WABIGOON......MY FIRST.......DOOOOONT LOSE IT!!!!! luckily i got it in for some piccies, well pleased, last cast of the evening and i get my first ever smb on the main body of Wabigoon Lake. I have had plenty from Mile and Trap Lakes, but these are off the main body of Wabigoon and are much clearer lakes. This was all the sweeter because not only was it my first....it equalled my PB...but weighed more than last 20"" i caught, i did not have scales to weigh....but i could just feel the difference in weight...I’d estimate at least 5lbs. Well that’s it for this report...if you made it all the way through...thanks for taking the time...lol...here’s a few snaps of the SMB...      MY FIRST WABIGOON SMB.....A BIG FAT ONE TOO!        "
