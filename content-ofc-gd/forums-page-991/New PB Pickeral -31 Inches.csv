231644,1leggedangler,2008-07-23 15:59:00,364,"Congrats Nemo! Having fished Kashwig a couple of times that is truly a trophy fish from that lake.  Cheers, 1leg"
230449,Nemo,2008-07-21 02:15:00,727,Haven't been able to do much fishing this year due to other priorities and a new job.  Any ways got a few minutes on Saturday to head out on Kashagawigamog for a couple hours.  I headed out to my spot and rigged up a worm harness with a nice dew worm.  Dropped it down in 18 - 20 feet  and began trolling it over some deep weed beds. The sun was high but there was a good chop and moderate wind that drifted me along.  First off I connect with nice 15 incher which puts up a nice fight. I'm pumped  as it looks like they are biting.  Rebait and head back over the same drift. Halfway through I had a huge strike. Stopped the motor and started to fight it. Took a couple of minutes to get it off the bottom. From the weight I knew it was a good one. Made some nice runs.  The neighbour kids trolled over to see what the commotion was. You should have seen their faces and mine when it came up.  No camera with them either dang.  It was pretty pooped when we got it up and made some small jumps. Boat side I was able to grab it (no net) and release the hook from the corner of it's mouth. Nicely hooked though.  Measured it quickly on the tape I have in my boat and it was 31 inches.  Got it back in the water and revived it for a couple minutes and it kicked off with a nice splash. Had the shaky leg and the sore arm so I was happy.  Finished off with another 15 which I added to the other for some bacon wrapped pickeral on the BBQ.  All in all a good trip.  Thanks for reading.  Nemo

230511,b2kptbo,2008-07-21 11:11:00,1505,"31 Beauty, congrats..."
230547,ccmtcanada,2008-07-21 12:21:00,7971,"WOW!! 31"" is a trophy size for sure!  They don't really get much bigger than that.  Congrats on a great PB."
230560,Reef Runner,2008-07-21 13:05:00,980,Congrats on the PB and an even better story.
230567,Marty,2008-07-21 13:27:00,873,That's a slob of a fish.  Great story.
230914,Nemo,2008-07-22 01:54:00,727,"Thanks for the notes gents. Did some looking around and found some video of a fish of the same size.  Of course I thought mine looked bigger (LOL) but it will give you some idea of size.  ""Jim Dicken, fishing out of Green Island Lodge hooks a gynormous Walleye. This walleye went 31 inches and weighed over 14 pounds. A top 10 Fish in Ontario in 2007, and the largest known Walleye from Lake Manitou""  "
230919,jwl,2008-07-22 01:59:00,1056,"right on man, rates right up there with the pigs from BOQ or Erie, they don't get much longer than that, had to be at least a conservative 12 lber or so..we wieghed a couple lately while out with some buddys in the 29-30 incher range pushing between 9-11 lbs or so from Erie..so you gotta know that one you caught is a real hog"
230928,ciceri,2008-07-22 02:24:00,535,nice fish man! you got a guesstimate on the weight?
231013,ccmtcanada,2008-07-22 12:22:00,7971,"Just to give perspective...this is Bly's 15 pound Walleye.  I believe it was 32"" long....but very fat.  "
231015,MrMike,2008-07-22 12:28:00,153,good job on your PB
231065,Bly,2008-07-22 13:59:00,1556,"Sweeeet!  Congrats on the new PB!   I always get a bit shaky when I pull in something like that,  not sure that feeling ever goes away, at least I hope not  Congratulations again!"
231075,Nemo,2008-07-22 14:21:00,727,Hey Bly I forgot about that fish. Very nice.
231139,Cookslav,2008-07-22 17:02:00,1457,"Here's another comparison for ya Nemo, She was 32"" x 19"" I did not take a weight measurement...but we estimated about 14lbs. Keeping in Mind this is a BOQ eye, your Kashagawigamog fish is WAY Impressive  "
231454,Nemo,2008-07-23 02:16:00,727,"Hey Cookslav thanks for the photo I was doing some googling and found this..hilarious  March 15 / 2008 - New World Record Walleye Through The Ice  I have no information yet but this might be a new world record Walleye for ice fishing. The Walleye is 23 pounds and was caught on Helen Lake near Steamboat Bay. If you have any information or more pictures of this fish, please email them to me at [emailÂ protected]  Please Note: Some people think this picture might be a fake. Ontario Out of Doors Magazine is investigating the fish.  Looks fake to me but maybe Terry can give his expert opinion.  "
231492,Cookslav,2008-07-23 03:57:00,1457,"I beleive this one came up as a fake earlier in the year? I seem to remember it had something to do with the shoulder position of the ""hold"" and a ""suspect"" shadow... or lack there of?"
231494,fish_finder,2008-07-23 04:13:00,370, Excellent job lettin the big one swim!!!
231564,limeyangler,2008-07-23 12:01:00,5204,Great Fish Nemo...thanks for sharing.
