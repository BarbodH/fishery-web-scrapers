231026,modny,2008-07-22 12:57:00,502,"well considering i've only landed 2 walleye out of the grand this year, ( would of been 3 if G didn't try to kill me) i'm going to give lake O a try.  i'll probably launch out of fishermans pier at the lift bridge.  i got 1 manual scotty downrigger, some flashers and spoons.  is there any recomended tactics for summer salmon? can anyone give some tips?  i've had good luck flat lining for lakers with j-13's and deep runner cranks years ago, wondering if this will still work   i jsut cant' go to the grand anymore.  , i lost 2 lures last night and half my spool of PP.  stupid dunnville. hahah so frustrating."
231032,MrMike,2008-07-22 13:02:00,153,fish are in about 90ft of water so you dont have to go very far out
231035,Uncle Buck,2008-07-22 13:10:00,1000,"Dunville is a hard fish... don't knock yourself up about it...  as for lake 0, launch out of bronte, and follow the pack of boats!!  they have been in shallow the last little while  get a dipsy to help your spread, run spoons and spin doctors and flies  good luck"
231043,bucktail,2008-07-22 13:29:00,1857,Thermocline off of Bronte has shifted down past the 40 foot mark over night. Start that far down.
231055,Greencoachdog,2008-07-22 13:46:00,8163,"I think it's probably the fisherman and not the body of water... if you sux at fishin' the Grand, what makes you think you aren't going to sux at fishin' lake O?"
231056,Gerritt,2008-07-22 13:49:00,6129,I did well in 35 over 140-160  Good luck!  G.
231059,Rich,2008-07-22 13:53:00,3927,Why would you fish Dunnville this time of year? Better walleye fishing is in the upper grand!
231074,highdrifter,2008-07-22 14:20:00,2534, LOL Glen! speaking from experience?  You think you're soo kewl with your sabiki rigs doncha?  chuckles..  HD
231094,kuhaman,2008-07-22 15:12:00,503,"Man,my four year old can catch wallys on the Grand. If you cant catch em there you must be doin something really wrong. Are you puttin your bait in the water? Any way, I thought this was a family oriented message board. Try to take it easy with the language.  Mika"
231131,modny,2008-07-22 16:53:00,502," thanks gerrit, we should hit it up one night out there or soemthing...     where abouts? i'd love to get out that way but i dont know the river well up there.."
231497,Fishmaster,2008-07-23 04:31:00,920,Get out with me for the day ...and you will be back more then 3 times ...guys have been killing the walleye on the Lower Grand its all about time of the day ...and working a area ..as for the Upper its a Hatchery Growing Grounds ...i never send anyone to the Upper for that reason ..and another reason is its very shallow with lots of Logs and mud to loose a prop ..  glad to see your boats working out better for you once that jinks leaves the boat you will be in action on the Grand ..Never Give Up
