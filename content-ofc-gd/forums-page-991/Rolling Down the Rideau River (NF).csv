231106,JustinHoffman,2008-07-22 15:48:00,482,"Hello All,  Spent a few hours casting a line yesterday on the Rideau River. The largemouth are still scattered and not relating to their normal haunts, making fishing a bit of a struggle as of late. Saying that, I did pop a few casting frogs and toads along shallow shoreline areas, and a couple on jigs in heavy cover...  Did come across an interesting sight at one point.  Saw what appeared to be a log sticking slightly out of the water. Worked the boat over, and to my surprise, caught two snapping turtles (and a big guy and gal at that) discovering the birds and bees!  Was really neat to see, and I was able to get within a foot or so from the action.  (At least the big guy was nice enough to let his mate catch her breath every once in a while!   )      Good Fishing,  Justin"

231130,maybe,2008-07-22 16:53:00,307,"Congrats, Justin - that really is a rare find!  Thanks for posting those pics.  Jeff and I found ourselves smack in the middle of a dragonfly orgy on Saturday.  Nothing shy about these critters - we kept having to shoo them off our rods, hands, feet, etc.      "

231213,misfish,2008-07-22 19:24:00,29133,"Very cool pic,s by all. I watched a couple of small butterfly  doing this thing  last week. At first I thought they were attacking each other,but on further watching,you could see them stop for a quick split sec, then fly off and do it again. This went on for about 15 minutes."
