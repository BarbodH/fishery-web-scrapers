If the container gats a little bit of a ""swish around"" in my tackle box there is a ring of that smelly juice on the bottom of the box. So what i did was take out spoon full's of it and put it with my berkly gulp packs.(asked berkly and said it was good to do) AS before still a leak.  Has anyone else had this leaking problem?If so how did you get it to stop if you could?    Thanks Mike."
231048,danbouck,2008-07-22 13:37:00,4380,Mine leaks too but I havn't done anything about it
231052,johnnyb,2008-07-22 13:39:00,3413,"there was a thread on this a while ago, about using a different container altogether...."
231053,Greencoachdog,2008-07-22 13:40:00,8163,Transfer you bait and juice into a more watertight container.
231061,ccmtcanada,2008-07-22 13:55:00,7971,Yep...I put mine in an old peanut butter container and it's fine.
231063,Bly,2008-07-22 13:56:00,1556,"Mike, it isn't just you.   I transferred ours to a well washed plastic peanut butter jar and it works great."
231064,wuchikubo,2008-07-22 13:57:00,1114,"I had the same problem over a year ago. Apparently Berkley already knows about it but has decided not to do anything about it yet.  Best thing to do is transfer all the contents to a watertight container (can get on from the dollar store/dollarama).  Then give berkley another call and complain about the container, hopefully at one point they'll start listening."
231076,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 14:23:00,3761, Problem fixed.  Thanks so much for the idea!  Why didn't I think of that
231077,Canuck2fan,2008-07-22 14:27:00,1444,I was going to use another container but came up with a faster solution. I just put the whole berkley container into a freezer ziplock that I seal up.... Bit of a pain having to make sure it is sealed but until I can find a small air tight one that will fight into my new smaller cooler bag it works so far. One other tip when the first ziplock gets too messed up do your whole family a favour and throw in the trash bin outside don't just leave in one in the house. That scent they use can get pretty ripe after a couple of hours in the open air.  I will have to write berkley a couple of customer complaint letters too!!!!
231079,Leecher,2008-07-22 14:41:00,7832,"I have to same problem and because it's almost time to buy another one, I just keep the bucket in a large ziplock bag.  I will definitely use the left over juice and put it into my other Gulp packs and use another container for my next purchase, very good idea.  Thanks guys for the tips. Leechman"
231087,mkeyes,2008-07-22 15:02:00,26,http://www.berkley-fishing.com/about_contactinfo.php  contact page for Berkley  I didn't realize that everyone else was having this problem as well... I just sat mine inside of a bowl because I don't have mine in a tackle box it just stays on the boat but I think I might put it in another container.
231093,steve_paul,2008-07-22 15:10:00,658,Mine is leaking too but I just ignore it.  I like the smell but I am not allowed to bring the tackle bag in the house anymore
231095,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 15:24:00,3761,Who knows somebody might be able to score some free berkly stuff lol kidding.....
