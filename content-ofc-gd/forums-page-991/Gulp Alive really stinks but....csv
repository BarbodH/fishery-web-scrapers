231499,Cudz,2008-07-23 04:43:00,2652,It stinks but it kind of tastes good.  Now I know that sounds weird and I do not go around eating/drinking the stuff but on several occasions I have put my hands in my mouth after touching the gulp alive bait and it tastes nothing like what it smells.  It has a really sweet taste. I recently find that I have been putting my hands in my mouth more and more after handling the gulp alive bait (but lets keep that on the downlow)  PS  That stuff really works well especially drop shotting for bass.  Wow! Too bad my whole bag and jacket stink of the juice though.
