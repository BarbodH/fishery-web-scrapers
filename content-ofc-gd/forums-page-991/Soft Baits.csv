231091,MrMike,2008-07-22 15:09:00,153,"Just wondering what Brand of soft baits most people use?  I have had good luck with Yamamoto baits and Strike zone, pheonix, wave and strike king. I find some seem to repel fish, like what is that smell that comes off of Bass Magnet (road Tar)."
231097,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 15:26:00,3761,"YUM soft plastics, my best yum bait would be the dinger."
231101,DANIMAL,2008-07-22 15:35:00,215,"I use a lot of Yamamoto and Berkly soft baits. And that road tar smell is just the smell of the plastic. Most soft baits are already scented or at least naturalized, but if not just add your own scent."
231104,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 15:41:00,3761, Yum makes good scent
231115,tbayboy,2008-07-22 16:25:00,1497,"The wave tiki worms seem to work well as well (and smell like licorice, go figure)."
231121,Beans,2008-07-22 16:43:00,3339," ""(and smell like licorice, go figure)""  Why not ???...I use anise to flavor my corn for carp fishing...Great stuff !!!  I use Phenix and Berkley soft baits for other fishes..."
231125,MrMike,2008-07-22 16:51:00,153,"If a bait smells like rubber, why buy it, when you can buy a bait that has scent added. And it is very strong, so would other scents even cover up the smell of the rubber(Bass-Magnet)"
231172,DANIMAL,2008-07-22 18:20:00,215,"Because Bass magnet makes some very nice baits, and most soft plastic musky baits smell like rubber. I use Bang scent in the erisol cans and it covers up the bad smell and lasts a long time."
231181,MrMike,2008-07-22 18:25:00,153,so musky like the smell of rubber? If so no wonder you cant catch a bass on Bass-Magnet soft plastic.
231187,EC1,2008-07-22 18:30:00,930,"if you're fishing anything besides panfish , i say powerbait / gulp work really well and smell probably really good to the fish, but lately, ive been using these micro tubes from Yum, and BPS for panfish and they DO smell like rubber, but it still seems to work wonders --- it might be just that we dont find that smell attractive, and there is this oil coating around the tube, not sure if that aids in enticing the fish to bite"
231191,DANIMAL,2008-07-22 18:40:00,215,"  I dont think you understood me. I dont think any fish likes the smell of rubber, so if it smells like rubber, scent it. And with some baits like a lot of soft plastic musky ones dont come in a scented version."
231197,bbog,2008-07-22 18:43:00,665,"I have good success with YUM, especially vibra kings and buzz frogs. No luck at all with Storm (yet)."
231216,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 19:25:00,3761, That sucks cause i just bought some Storm baits this morning. I will try them out and will be sure to tell if they are good.
231225,Angler16,2008-07-22 19:53:00,188,YUM DINGERS! HOOK RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE JUST THROW IT OUT!BAM BAM BAM BITES thats what i have heard bass after bass! It turns them on.
231479,Rich,2008-07-23 03:31:00,3927,I have yet to find a soft plastic company that makes a lure that doesn't work well.  I guess I buy more Wave Worms and Berkly products because they're readily available and work just fine.
231485,MrMike,2008-07-23 03:42:00,153,good info I still think Bass- Magnet sucks though
231504,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-23 04:57:00,2585,"yum dingers, wave worms, senkos, power wors, frogs, craws all work at a time and place  pretty much you have ot find what the fish want.  it may take trying many different plasctics before you find what the fish want.  and the next day it may be totally different  Cheers!"
231523,Rich,2008-07-23 10:24:00,3927,"What are your thoughts on Bass Magnet, Mr Mike?"
231525,Cudz,2008-07-23 10:34:00,2652,"I was trying to get my dad into soft swimbaits and he bought a couple of packs of storm 4"" swimbaits. My mom used one and caught a walleye on her first cast.  They proceeded to catch over 25 walleye in 4 hours fishing over 2 days and they fished at midday both days!!!  Go figure.  Personally you can't go wrong with an original senko.  Gulp alive is insane as well.  I have good luck with bass magnet tubes although I have never caught anything on their hollow-belly swimbaits (which is a bit dissapointing).  I also use a 6"" BPS stick bait (senko style) in pumpkinseed with red flake that is awesome.  A bit heavier and easy to cast greater distance.  I usually drop shot Gulp Alive stuff but would to give Mark Kulik's bait a try as well."
