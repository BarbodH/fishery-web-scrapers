231185,Moosebunk,2008-07-22 18:29:00,3970,"Actually, YES!!!  I'm guessing the road and many of those lakes right now.  You and Cliff have a great time.  Leave me the link to this one in a pm if you're not back by next tuesday."

231237,solopaddler,2008-07-22 20:28:00,8605," I'm ALL for that idea, can't do it though. I work at the weather office in Hamilton and we can't leave our stations unmanned LOL! Besides which I've got some major weather occurring here this evening which is keeping me unusually busy. (figures  )  Thanks again everyone, it's gonna be a fun one!"
231242,dannyboy,2008-07-22 20:33:00,367,Could you set the controls for some decent weather before you go?  Have fun Dan

231273,JohnF,2008-07-22 21:18:00,3494, There's a thought. Mebbe he's like some kinda bad weather magnet. We'll see how it goes while he's away. If he and Cliff get rained out and we get sun - I say we petition for him to be fired.  JF
231275,addict,2008-07-22 21:22:00,475,cant wait for the post.anxious to see how u make out.
231276,scuro,2008-07-22 21:24:00,386,Sounds like fun. Weedbeds should be well established. I'd be taking a temp gage.
231282,solopaddler,2008-07-22 21:38:00,8605, I think I'm in trouble. They're calling for rain every single day up there  .
