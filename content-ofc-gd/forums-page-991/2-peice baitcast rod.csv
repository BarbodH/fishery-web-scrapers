230047,commie,2008-07-20 02:28:00,29,"I have been using spinner reels/rod in the past..Would like to try using a baitcaster.  What are some decent 2 peice rods to use with a baitcasting reel?  Need 2 peice for ease of storage in cars.  I am a newb with the world of baitcasting, are the rods any different from the spinners?  I fish mostly bass and walleyes."
230057,danbo,2008-07-20 03:38:00,2646,How much $$ you want to spend?  Fenwick & St.Croix are sweet.
230075,jace,2008-07-20 08:10:00,472,"   the rods are completely different.  Casting rods are less flexible even for the same weight rating, the seat has a trigger so you can hang on during the cast because you swing harder than a spinning rod, the guides are smaller and most likely more of them per foot for 2 rods of the same price.   In reality, the best casting rods are all one piece.  there are no middle or top quality casting rods that aren't 1 piece unless it's 8' or longer and even some of those are 1 piece...  If you need 2 piece, you're looking at the lower end of the scale, but maybe that's what you're looking for to start off."
230155,Canuck2fan,2008-07-20 14:22:00,1444,I have seen a two piece 6.6 ft Quantum HSX54 Tour Edition rods here in a store on sale for 49.99. That seems to be a great deal given that even though it is last years model the new ones go for around 108.00 it would be a quality choice to start with as it would be good enough to last and not so expensive you would regret keeping it for a spare if you wanted to upgrade from it as you got better at casting.
230186,commie,2008-07-20 16:16:00,29,"  Which store did you see that rod at?  My budget for my first baitcast rod and the reel would be around $200.  Its not really set in stone, i would rather get something nice and that I don't have to replace in the future if it means spending more.  But on the other hand, being a newbie in baitcasters, i want something that is easy to learn and get a hand of things.  Not sure if those are mutually exclusive of each other?  $$$ and the ease of use."

230565,Reef Runner,2008-07-21 13:18:00,980,"BPS baitcasters are approx. $36.00.  Not top quality, but gets the job done.  They even come in a two-piece"
230984,singingdog,2008-07-22 10:04:00,1047,"BPS has some nice 2 piece baitcasters. I have the Bionic Blade 6'6"" and it is a fine rod for search baits and jigs. There is a lot of prejudice against 2 piece rods, but modern ones are just as sensitive as one-piece rods. Once you experience the accuracy of a baitcaster, you will have a hard time going back to spinning set-ups."
231060,johnnyb,2008-07-22 13:55:00,3413,"Bionic blade is a great rod lineup...I wouldn't feel bad about any of them.  However, I cart my one-piece 7 footer and 6 footer in my little 2-door Neon without much grief.  As long as you feel good about the rod you choose, you'll be fine...but if you really want a one piece...fitting it in the car really won't be much hassle in the end."
231096,bigbuck,2008-07-22 15:25:00,2449,"Don't go too cheap on the reel, with baitcasters, you get what you pay for, pretty much anything over $150 would be a fine reel, you can get a NICE St Croix Premier 2 pc for under $150, get a Medium Heavy action as a general purpose rod. Check out JB's Fishing Depot by the 401/427 in Toronto, they've got the best prices on St Croix and the best selection."
