230635,blaque,2008-07-21 16:07:00,2419,"Just one of the slobs weve been getting out on the U.S. side of Erie. Drop shot goby imitations.... as many know.... are the norm out here and they just keep coming thru. Found alot of these guys schooled up in the mid 20's. , its a blast seeing how fast they can come from 25 foot of water and jump for the skies lol. Like i said, they were schooled up in pods........and you could go thru hot spots where it was one after the other, and then dead for another 100 yards , then hit another school and hit double headers.  These guys are getting so big out there they are starting to resemble carp LOL  "
230637,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-21 16:08:00,3761,"Nice fish, thanks for sharing."
230646,joefish,2008-07-21 16:33:00,165,Isn't that fish porn?  Showing a nice catch with your BVD'S!!!!!LOL!!
230648,Greencoachdog,2008-07-21 16:34:00,8163,   Oh what a big fibber you are!!! Everyone knows Gobies are highly toxic to Smallies and they won't hardly touch them... and will be dead in seconds after ingesting one.  ... so what were you really using???  Great report and pic!!!
230650,1leggedangler,2008-07-21 16:36:00,364,"Nice slab!! I've never caught smallies in deep water, do you have to watch for the bladders when bringing them up from 20-30 feet? If so what is the best way to revive them? Thanks for the report.  Cheers, 1leg"
230664,denisk,2008-07-21 17:15:00,163,Nice fish
230669,dannyboy,2008-07-21 17:20:00,367,"They don't seem to be affected by the pressure change, let them go and they head right back for the bottom no worse for wear. Been catching them on the Canadian side, once hooked they come out of 20+ feet of water like a Polaris Missile, great fun.  Dan"
230670,blaque,2008-07-21 17:23:00,2419," LOL, swim trunks........ya never know when your gonna feel like takin a dip!"
230675,blaque,2008-07-21 17:32:00,2419,  Ha ha......your sarcasm is so subtle GCD! lol  We were actually using steamed zebra mussels hardy harr
230677,blaque,2008-07-21 17:36:00,2419," Yeah, ive never seen that come up as a concern in 20-30ft......maybe 50 plus. I dunno........if you do run into that being a problem........i think what most guys do is ""fizz"" the fish. Never had to do it myself though."
230679,blaque,2008-07-21 17:38:00,2419, look whos talkin Denis........is that a dumptruck in your avatar!! OMG!
230713,misfish,2008-07-21 18:24:00,29133,"Nice fatty Dropp,n for them is a blast. TFS"
230720,Leecher,2008-07-21 18:39:00,7832,"Nice catch Blaque   Sure fun catching smallies, especially when they do arials  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
231062,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-22 13:56:00,0,Sounds like world class phenomenal Smallie fishing to me. And that is with an all year open season!I don't think they keep as many smallies on the US side as they do on the Canadian side.
231066,Bly,2008-07-22 14:02:00,1556,Nice!   I might need to spend some $ and try out the goby imitations.  Thanks
231206,blaque,2008-07-22 18:55:00,2419,"  Yeah, most are  focused on stringin up them Erie pickerel .....er, i mean walleyes"
231227,JohnF,2008-07-22 19:59:00,3494, The difference may be that when they do the polaris trip they're doing it voluntarily and expel air from the bladder as they come up. When they're being horsed up they may be fighting and don't know enuf to blow out.  JF
