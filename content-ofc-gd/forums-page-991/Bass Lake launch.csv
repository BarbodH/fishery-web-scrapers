Is there any free launches other than the PP one? If not, is the entry fee the same as Sibbald PP? $12???  Oh and whats in there besides largies?"
231218,misfish,2008-07-22 19:28:00,29133,"Big catfish and if you can find the deep whole out in the middle,rainbows. As for the launch no idea. I know they do charge though,and the ramp must be ok as bass boats launch there aswell. Have fun."

231221,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-22 19:38:00,0,Thanks guys! Big catfish as in Channel Cats or brown bullheads??? Rainbows too? I wonder what lure they can be caught off in the deep water???  Thanks Peter. I'll give Joshua a call.
231231,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-22 20:14:00,0, Nah. But it includes enterance to the provincial park and access to the beach and park facilities.  But Launches used to be $5 and as soon as I got my boat? Some launches are $20 now!!! Pathetic!
