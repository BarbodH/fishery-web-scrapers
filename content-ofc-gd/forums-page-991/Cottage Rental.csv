The question is where???? Some thoughts... @3 hour drive from the Hamilton area Good fishing, Walleye , Perch etc, have done Quinte lots. Nice place, doesn't have to be big and not a bank breaker!   Any suggestions Thanks Jeff"

My cottage is located on the shores of Bain lake (15 mins. north of Sturgeon Falls) Here is a panoramic view of the place thanks to T.J.. Oh yeah btw.. Thanks T.J!!  www.westnipissingouest.com/panorama0074.html"
