230765,GBW,2008-07-21 19:48:00,8460,"here you go, right from boaterexam.com. ""Q. Who needs the Pleasure Craft Operator Card and when? A. All operators of powered watercraft used for recreational purposes within Canada will eventually require the card.The following three groups of boaters require the card IMMEDIATELY:  All operators of any powered watercraft under 4m in length (13.1ft) All operators of PWC's (i.e.: sea-doos and jet skis) All operators of any powered watercraft born after April 1, 1983 As of September 15, 2009 all boaters will be required to have the Pleasure Craft Operator Card in order to operate a powered watercraft. There is no grandfather clause or age exemption – this law applies to all boaters. Powered watercraft includes watercraft fitted with any size motor – even a trolling motor. """
230801,vance,2008-07-21 20:47:00,719,Renting a boat from a licenced renter does not require that you have a licence.The rental operator will give you a dockside instruction and oral test for competancy.From what I have seen and heard you can't flunk the test.  vance
230980,Woodsman,2008-07-22 08:41:00,1286,As vance stated you don't need a pleasure operators card for a rental boat. The renters will check you out & give you a checklist which you must carry on the boat. GBW's quotes are correct but only part of the regulations.  Best Wishes: Rick

231415,mkeyes,2008-07-23 01:20:00,26,Wow and this is why I have to worry about every other boater out there. I have been driving cruisers for the last 22 years. I assist my father when he needs someone to tutor for the test he teaches through the Power and Sail Squadron. You never know who took a course and who took the dock side ya ya test. hmmmmm 
231511,Fish4Eyes,2008-07-23 05:16:00,1022,I was shocked myself that the lodge owner even gave me the boat the first I rented one. I felt like I needed boat driving school.
