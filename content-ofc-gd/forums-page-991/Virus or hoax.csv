231292,danc,2008-07-22 22:04:00,4677, I got an e mail about this a month or so ago. I suspect it is under control by now. But I could be wrong. The Risk Assessment for this virus is low. Thanks for the heads up Brian.
231293,Gerritt,2008-07-22 22:08:00,6129,"Real.  Overview -  This is a trojan detection. Unlike viruses, trojans do not self-replicate. They are spread manually, often under the premise that they are beneficial or wanted. The most common installation methods involve system or security exploitation, and unsuspecting users manually executing unknown programs. Distribution channels include email, malicious or hacked web pages, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), peer-to-peer networks, etc. Characteristics Characteristics -  As many other DDoS trojan Storm has two main parts. A server that runs on compromized systems and a client, from which the hacker controls the DDoS attack. Different variants exists of this threat which may show sligtly different behaviours. The server part, when executed, goes resident and opens a listening port (TCP 41337). When the it receive a command from the client part it initiate a dos attack targeting a specific host. It sends loads of invalid IP fragments with the intent of eating up the victim server resources. Some variants let the victim know they are running, some don't. Symptoms Symptoms -  Presence of the following files:  * [various] 298496 server variant * c:\windows\wkernel.exe 174080 server variant * [various] 177152 server variant * [various] 22528 client variant * [various] 49664 client variant  Some variants let the victim know they are running, some don't and hooks themself into the registry.

231296,Bly,2008-07-22 22:12:00,1556,"""Although the Postcard virus is real, it isn't a ""BIG VIRUS COMING"" (it's already been around in multiple forms for a long time now), it will not ""burn the whole hard disc"" of your computer, CNN didn't classify it as the ""worst virus"" ever, and it doesn't arrive in the message bearing a subject line of 'Invitation.'""  The above is quoted from the Snopes link.......  Brian, you should be fine if you are following wise web protocol.  Cheers"
231636,legacey,2008-07-23 15:43:00,127,"A lot of these are intended more of a ""social virus"" in which people do a mass emailing of the information, as above, to everyone they know. It then creates havoc on mail servers and email accounts, trying to send and receive these messages.  I'm sure you're okay and if you get the old message to see if you have a ""teddy bear"" icon within your windows directory, that is a virus, delete the message not the icon. It's a windows file and another email meant to cause panic.  Being in the computer field, it's great to read people asking on a public forum, rather than receiving it 50 times in an email and it shutting down our mail servers.  Cheers,  Paul"
