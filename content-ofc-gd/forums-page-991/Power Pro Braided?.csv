231193,Angler16,2008-07-22 18:41:00,188,Thanks Raf because in the booklet in the package thers about 5knots and uni is on i learned
231212,Vanselena,2008-07-22 19:15:00,269,"Currently have 10 rods with 15 and 20lb braids. Have Whiplash, Power Pro, Tuf line and Stren Super Braid. I fish 4 x a week on Erie for Rainbows and have not had a single breakoff from any of the braids mentioned above.   Price wise Tuf line is the lowest.  Remember that abrasion resistance is directly related to diameter of line and not line type. .02"" mono and braid will both break at the same time if rubbed against the same rock at the same time.  The strength in braid comes in it's length mode."
231229,Reef Runner,2008-07-22 20:08:00,980,"I use PP 20# green on my spinning gear and 50# red on my baitcaster.  Luv 'em both, however, the red comes of on your hands, reel and rod eyes.  Never had it snap, even got it wrapped around a tree branch parcticing with egg sinkers in the backyard during the boring-arse winter and nearly took the whole tree (50#).  Line dug DEEP into the branch as I wanted to test its strength, would've been my PB maple."
231891,canadianboy,2008-07-23 23:40:00,83,wow sorry somebody mentioned spider wire dont get it unless you are a really talented fisherman. im no amateur but when it knots 4 times in the first ten casts and took 25 minutes to get on my reel because it kept noting not a good sign im just going to stick with the ever reliable triline
231893,brickNblock,2008-07-23 23:45:00,598,"lil angler..... I use quite a bit of PP line. Anywhere from 4-40lb for bassin' My main use is on my big equipment for lunge, Im equiped w/65-80-100lb's...all w/fluoro leaders 'cepting the bass lines...Tied direct."
231894,brickNblock,2008-07-23 23:48:00,598,"...forgot to add that in almost all instances, the fluoro leader is several lb's heavier then the main line. ........(ie:  the 100PP has a 120lb leader"""
230972,Angler16,2008-07-22 04:47:00,188,"Hey everyone,hows it goin?hope you all are well. Just a quick question for ye.My dad just picked up some Power Pro Braided 20lb line has anyone used this brand if so how is it , hows the memory on it and does it cast farther than other lines like Stren? Any help would be appreciated Thanks in advance -Little Angler"
230976,Moosebunk,2008-07-22 06:23:00,3970,Lay a slight bed of mono on the spool then tie the braid to the mono with a uni to uni knot and finish spooling up the braid.  PowerPro is good stuff.  Should cast farther than mono and has no memory.  Use a palomar knot when tying lures and snaps to that line.  I like the stuff for much of the fishing I do.  Good and sensitive for detecting the light bite eyes and super responsive to easy hooksets for big toothy pike.
230977,Guest skeeter99,2008-07-22 06:27:00,0,best braid out there for the price
230985,4thgen,2008-07-22 10:15:00,157,"I ran 50lb Power Pro on my musky rig last year  and it never broke (fish up to 47""). Just remember that you have to use the palomar knot because knots pull out really easy with this line. Even if a clinch knot feels tight and you give it a good tug, it will probably slip on any hookset."
230987,Cudz,2008-07-22 10:26:00,2652,power pro is probably the most popular braid.  I have had good experience with it in green.  I don't recommend the red. Maybe I just had a bad batch.
230989,Marc Thorpe,2008-07-22 10:49:00,621,"Ive seen to many instances where 80 and 100 lbs power pro go snap I wont even allow anyone to use it in my boat After watching my baits go bye bye just from casting,god forbid a fish ever broke off  It does not do well under sudden impact  Ive used Gorilla braid,whiplash and all now called Spider wire stealth,minimum 65 and 80 for 15 years or so,no problems I dont even retie for a week or 2 at times  just my observations"
231000,Mike the Pike,2008-07-22 12:02:00,3421,I use Power Pro bought some this year but I must say I also use Stren Super Braid much better than Power Pro
231002,MrMike,2008-07-22 12:04:00,153,good line cant go wrong with it
231003,modny,2008-07-22 12:06:00,502,yea i love it  zero stretch and no memory. its great
231005,BillM,2008-07-22 12:09:00,17367,"I run Power Pro and Spiderwire Invisibraid Ultracast on my muskie setup.  I've snapped off Power pro 3-4 times, never the spiderwire."
231006,desship,2008-07-22 12:09:00,96,"Never had problems but use a flurocarbon leader.Checks your knot Braid Knot   Braid Knot  Best if used with new braided line.  1)  Run double loop through eye at hook or lure.  2)  Loop around end of line and standing part of braided line 8 times.  Thread double loop back between the eye and coils.  3)  Tighten knot with a steady even motion without hesitation.  Trim double loop and end of braided line leaving about 1/4"". Braid Knot"
231008,ccmtcanada,2008-07-22 12:14:00,7971,"I use power pro for just about anything and have never had the line snap from casting.  Mind you, I'm not throwing huge muskie lures either."
231025,Garry2Rs,2008-07-22 12:56:00,1425,"I like Power Pro a lot.  This year I am using the red ten pound on my spinning reels for Senko worms, it is very easy to see against the water with my sunglasses.  I use green 30 pound on my baitcasters, but might go up to 50 pound for a couple of rods.  My Musky reels had 80 pound and I never broke it once...maybe Mark had a bad spool.  I don't use flouro leaders the fish don't mine the line as long as the bait acts naturally...in my opinion.  I have used almost every braid on the market at one time or another.  No Spectra line likes a sudden snap and I have had spools of every brand that I thought were weak.  If you contact the manufacturer, they will generally replace that spool for you.  I recently returned 300 yards of 30 pound Micro-fuse Invisabraid, Spiderwires new line.  The first spool was crap...the replacement spool is fine.  If you remember that the braid is no more abrasion resistant than mono of the same diameter IE 10 pound is the diameter of two pound mono, you will understand that you need to check for nicks and frayed spots once in awhile.  Granite edges and Zebra mussels will cut the line quickly, check the line if you get dragged over rocks or around stumps etc. Garry2R's"
231031,muskymike,2008-07-22 13:01:00,772,"I always read about guys snapping line with PP. I use it exclusively on my musky setups with 80 and 100#, nothing lighter. I use 130# flouro with that as well. I have had backlashes casting ""Pounders"" Magnum Bull Dawgs, 10"" Jakes, Bucktails and so on, I have used it for about 5 years now and it has never failed me. I guess its just the luck of the draw though, but if you are asking for opinions, PP is the best out there I think."
231034,Raf,2008-07-22 13:05:00,3495,"another PP user.  currnetly have 50, 65, 80 and 100 spooled on my reels.  never an issue other than cost however, that comes back since the stuff just last so long.  tuf line is the other brand i use."
231037,Leecher,2008-07-22 13:18:00,7832,"PP is the way go...Have 50# on my musky reel and don't have an issue with it.  A friend of mine has 40# and caught a 44"" musky without any issues.  Leechman"
231040,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 13:23:00,3761,I myself don't use it but my uncle does and he has never had a problem.
231046,danbouck,2008-07-22 13:35:00,4380,"Currently use the 10, 20, 40 and 50 and love it. As said above use the right knots"
231051,CLofchik,2008-07-22 13:39:00,854,"I think the problem with people snapping PP is getting nicks.  It WILL nick, and if it does the strength is compromised greatly.  I use 20lb PP pier casting for salmon, around 100 fish a season, and never once break off.  Seeing as every year I get a pulled muscle from strikes the shock strength is fine. I also always use a 3' length of flouro tippet, for visibility & avoiding nicks.  Check for nicks frequently, like a frayed cable nicked PP will give way easily.  Been using the same spool for three years, just unwound and reversed it on the spool and shouldn't have any problems getting another two seasons out of it."
231072,Rich,2008-07-22 14:14:00,3927,Power Pro is good stuff. I wouldn't say it's the best of the braids but it's certainly not the worst either. I think he'll be satisfied with his purchase. Make sure you use some mono for backing as already mentioned or the line will slip on the spool.
231151,JoshS,2008-07-22 17:28:00,729,I'm using Stren braid 30lb on my bass and walleye rod and having zero problems.  quality braid.
231171,Angler16,2008-07-22 18:19:00,188,Would a uni knot be good too?
231180,BillM,2008-07-22 18:23:00,17367,"The palomar knot for braid is a no brainer, takes all of 5 seconds and it probably the strongest of them all."
231184,Angler16,2008-07-22 18:28:00,188,i tried to learn it its not that hard i just get confused with it because i have been using other knots for so long.
231189,Raf,2008-07-22 18:34:00,3495,"uni's just fine.. it's the one i use.  if someone were to learn just one knot, that's the one i'd recommend."
