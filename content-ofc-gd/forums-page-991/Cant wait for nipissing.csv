188034,blaque,2008-04-16 12:07:00,2419,"I Like the largemouth mailbox lol. Still doesnt look very lived in or ""homie""  I spoke with Frank as well about the life of a lodgeowner as another friend of mine bought a place up near Elliot Lake. (which coincidentally frank looked at before he bought promise land)  Frank had exactly the same to say about it as my friend. Its work work work from sunrise to sunset and beyond. 7 days a week. And Frank aint kiddin , i didnt see him stop for more than 5 minutes at a time lol. And that was usually just to stop on the deck and sit and talk with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Other than that it was cuttin the grass........spreading topsoil..........getting boats ready for arrivals the next morning..........checking people in........cleaning fish............etc etc etc..........Most people when looking at those who own a camp or lodge think of it as glamorous, i know i did, ""Living the dream"" if you will...........which im sure you get alot of satisfaction out of it, but as all lodge owners mention, it is a lifestyle........one that doesnt make you much money. Once you start to get a bit saved up off the lodge, it goes right into the lodge for something. Hopefully all his hard work got him something when it sold. Its a shame to see them go."

189591,little angler,2008-04-19 19:15:00,128,"Well my dad phoned promised land camp 3 days ago Frank and Claire are gone indeed, didn't even get to say good bye . When my dad phoned he asked for Claire or Frank and the new guy said they had just sold the place and what not. The new guy Henning seems really nice my dad says. Him and his wife have just moved from kitchener so i thought i might just let you know about that, I'm sure the new guy Henning and his wife will make us feel at home just as Frank and Claire did."
