I find that the screen is almost impossible to see even in low light and since can't see very well, its hard to know if its actually working right or not.  It came with the boat I picked up last year, so was willing to try it out since I have it.  It may need to be sent to Humminbird for repairs or something, but again, is it worth doing that and however much that may end up costing?  I brought the unit inside and plugged it into a power pack to run it on demo mode and its coming on but not doing too much in the way of demo.  Only other sonar I have now is a Piranha max 20 that I clamp onto my sportspal, I am tempted to just clamp that onto the bigger boat for now and not bother with this unit, better than nothing.  Unfortunately, the transducers aren't the same."
