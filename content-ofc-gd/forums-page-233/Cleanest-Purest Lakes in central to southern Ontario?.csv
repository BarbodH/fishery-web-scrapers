I had heard somewhere that Simcoe was up there but wanted to read up.  Any and all info is welcome.  Thank you for your time folks!"
856601,Sinker,2014-06-04 13:56:00,8692,Best place to find that info is probably the fish eating guide.  S.
856614,Lunkerhunter,2014-06-04 15:32:00,455,I have been told that lady Evelyn lake is one of the cleanest in southern Ontario. I have fished it a number of times and can say it is also a very healthy fish factory.

857051,Locnar,2014-06-07 13:29:00,645,For someone from thunder bay it is...lol.. the guys from Southern ontario would beg to differ... Most people in Southern Ontario consider Sudbury to be Northern Ontario...

857082,Steve,2014-06-07 19:17:00,2075,"actually, Sudbury is considered northern ontario.  just look at their property tax statement."
857098,Locnar,2014-06-07 21:01:00,645,Geographically Sudbury is central ontario.
857099,Steve,2014-06-07 21:06:00,2075,you are correct sir.
857117,adempsey,2014-06-07 22:53:00,1498,"I'd also say the fish eating guide and perhaps if the lake still has a reasonably sized natural population of trout in it.   Maybe it's untrue, but I've always considered trout to be the canary of water bodies.  Of course, many lakes don't have the required habitat that trout need so they were never there, but plenty do."
857147,John Bacon,2014-06-08 03:22:00,3277,Geographically Sudbury is central ontario.  I think they are considered Northern Ontario for curling.
857152,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-08 05:47:00,8243,"Cleanest compared to what benchmark? Is there any lake in those regions one would consider drinking straight from it? I know I wouldn't if I didn't have to. Educate me. Oh yea, I'm originally from Hamilton, we used to go up north to Wasaga Beach for May 24. Orillia was near the Artic Circle we thought. Maps hadn't been invented yet you must understand."
857297,SylvanOwner,2014-06-09 16:23:00,266,"I would try contacting the MOE for this type of information.  The organization I work for would collect clams from Balsam Lake to use as the 'control'/base level of toxicity.  The other clams would be deployed in traps along the Toronto waterfront and at the end of the season the accumulated toxins would be compared to the 'control'.  Why Balsam you ask?  It's the highest point in the Trent Canal system so everything flows out and away, hence less likely to accumulate toxins.  ""Clean"" is a relative comparison."
857315,SirCranksalot,2014-06-09 19:24:00,3291,"""Clean"" is a relative comparison.  very true. Because of air borne contaminants not even Arctic lakes are pristine. Think about that if you are tempted to throw plastic on an open fire. Also bear in mind that many lakes around G Bay have naturally occurring mercury, so even though they may have no external sources of pollution, the recommended # of fish that can be safely eaten is still limited."
