Lake O is still taking in all the cold water the upstream lakes are sending her, and combined with the large alewife die off, she really isn't her usual self for this time of year, so looking for alternatives.."
856851,G.mech,2014-06-05 23:15:00,830,They're on fire from the River to Leamington and out at the islands as well!! The Colchester derby is tomorrow so not too many reports this week but all along the North shore has been producing I am told.   We did very well around Colchester 3 weeks ago and are heading to Leamington tomorrow (Colchester ramp is closed for tourney).  Rumour has it West of Leamington in 32-36 fow has been good pulling in-line weights but I'm sure bottom bouncers will be effective too. Take lots of bait though the garbage fish are thick.
