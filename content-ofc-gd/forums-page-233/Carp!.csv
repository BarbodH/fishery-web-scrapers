856350,JerMac,2014-06-02 19:33:00,37,I had a friend lose his rod salmon fishing never got it back tho! Nice carp tho indeed!
856357,mistaredone,2014-06-02 19:54:00,913,Nice!  I've gotta give carp a try one day
856398,alphaalpha,2014-06-02 23:23:00,475,"Nice hog! And super lucky getting the gear back,well done!"
856413,Gallie,2014-06-03 00:33:00,1215,"Funny thing is i went out of my way to tie special hair rigs and buy/make fancy carp baits, and yet i always end up back to a single hook with corn and a weight"
856450,Fisherpete,2014-06-03 13:18:00,1814,"Nice one!  My bait of choice has always been corn on a single hook, but this weekend the corn was getting swiped within minutes by all the sunfish in the shallows. 5 minutes on Youtube and I learned how to tie a hair rig... Happened to have a pack of boilies with me as well. 19 of the 20 carp caught on Saturday were on the boilies, as well as the one I caught on Sunday.  Pete"
856459,CRUD150,2014-06-03 15:58:00,87,Nice! The sheer weight of it caused your dock to cave in as well.
856482,Mike Pike,2014-06-03 19:26:00,1332,"Great story!  Nice job getting 'er in.  You'll remember this day for a long time, I'll bet."
856487,Gallie,2014-06-03 19:56:00,1215,"Hahaha, the dock is on the list"
856496,fishnsled,2014-06-03 20:13:00,3520,That's a brute!  I may have to find a spot to kill a couple of hours close to home during the week nights.
856512,Gallie,2014-06-03 21:53:00,1215,I used to fish them all over the holland river but dont really anymore for obvious reasons
856959,hammercarp,2014-06-06 19:33:00,964,Great fish and a great story. You are a lucky man to get the rod back. Well done.
