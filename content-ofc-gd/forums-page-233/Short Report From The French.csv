856056,bigcreekdad,2014-05-31 12:19:00,546,"Fished 4 days out of Lochaven Lodge. Water levels VERY high. Some small islands just plain were unseen. Thus, very hard to find any weed growth. To top it off, both of my graphs quit....one dead, another a boat wiring issue I just could not resolve. So....depth was just a guessing game, albeit an educated one having fished that area many times.  Averaged about 4-5 fish a day. Even mix of pike and walleye. no pike over 26"". Walleye biggest was 25"". Saw a 30 inches brought in by another fisherman. 90% of my fish were on a black 3/8 oz black buck tail jig tipped with a worm. That has been my Spring go to lure for 40 years."
856064,Ralph Field,2014-05-31 13:06:00,1018,"You did well to average 4 or 5 fish a day on the French, as the river isn't as good today."
856066,Rich Clemens,2014-05-31 13:14:00,3131,Yup.  Not bad for a short trip.   Good thing you know the area with the electronics crapping out on ya like that
856084,Lunatic,2014-05-31 17:38:00,536,im counting down the days
856088,sneak_e_pete,2014-05-31 18:12:00,540,I am booked into Totem Point for a week June 14-21...hoping fishing picks up.
856095,bigcreekdad,2014-05-31 20:10:00,546,"Pete....you are going at a great time IMO. Weeds will be there, but not super thick yet. Also, walleyes should still be relating to the weeds. I'm going back up June 28th for a week."
856264,chris.brock,2014-06-02 01:52:00,4053,"definitely it's mentally hard to fish without the graph, I know the feeling  good job on getting the walleye, they can be elusive up there"
856290,Cosmos,2014-06-02 11:54:00,588,"Me and my wife were camping on French for 3 days since last Friday. Water is really high with a lot of floating logs. We got lucky and didn't hit anything. Fishing was one of my best on French River for last 6 years. We tried to find fish shallow but ended up with 1 small pike, oos smallie and big pike followed. So we start jigging. That paid off really well - wife got her PB eye - 26"", I got 21"",22"" and 18"", a lot of 12""-14"" for pan. We caught some big smallies and pikes as well. My wife ended our trip with beautiful 10 lbs catfish."
856300,bigcreekdad,2014-06-02 13:04:00,546,"Costa.....sounds like you did well! What section were you in? THe jig is an awesome fish catcher. Surprisingly, I didn't catch a smallmouth in 4.5 days. Glad to here you did well on them as well."
856309,Cosmos,2014-06-02 14:43:00,588,"Costa.....sounds like you did well! What section were you in? THe jig is an awesome fish catcher. Surprisingly, I didn't catch a smallmouth in 4.5 days. Glad to here you did well on them as well. I launched from French River Supply Post and went 15 km upstream. We caught probably 10 smallies jigging for eyes with biggest one around 4-5 lbs."
856310,sneak_e_pete,2014-06-02 14:59:00,540,Hey Costa...heading there in less than 2 weeks...mind me asking the jigging depth?  Pm welcome
856313,Cosmos,2014-06-02 15:56:00,588,Hey Costa...heading there in less than 2 weeks...mind me asking the jigging depth? Pm welcome Jigging depth - 25 - 35 fow. Once you locate bait fish you can jig doesn't matter how deep. I caught pike on 45 fow.
