857127,Handlebarz,2014-06-08 00:42:00,3790,Been very busy here with family and work life have not checked in as much as I like to but I want to wish all the musky nuts a awesome 2014 musky season.
856514,SuperDave,2014-06-03 22:17:00,204,Can't wait for Saturday will be fishing Pigeon Lake for muskie opener. Then possibly a day trip to LSC next week... followed by a week long trip to Ottawa for my first crack at the mighty Ottawa river. Bring on Muskie season!
856523,captpierre,2014-06-03 22:49:00,2521,Had a heavy one on last week jigging for eyes on Pigeon.  Couldn't budge her as she circled the boat.  No head shake.  Didn't see her  Then she released the smalley on the hook.  The bass was in bad shape.  Hope she's around on the weekend
856542,esoxansteel,2014-06-04 00:33:00,1307,"Ill be playing around with marble eyes for awhile yet, before the big stuff comes out"
856545,Lunatic,2014-06-04 00:47:00,536,"pigeon is good for muskies,good luck."
856547,Pigeontroller,2014-06-04 00:55:00,2793,Your plans sound very similar to mine! Maybe I'll see you out there!
856557,musky666,2014-06-04 02:09:00,126,"Will be on Balsam next Thursday, likely too busy this weekend, then heading to the near north for the Ski opener..."

Lawrence.  going to be an awesome year on some new water
856618,lew,2014-06-04 16:08:00,12766,a guided trip in September with Mike Rousseau on the st. Lawrence.  Mike and I fished together on the Larry a couple years back.  Fun guy to fish with and you'll have a great time.
856645,Dan668,2014-06-04 18:58:00,1120,"Cant wait either, ill be on balsam most likely. Possibly pigeon."
856694,Fisherpete,2014-06-04 23:02:00,1814,It's slime time boys  All other fish step aside for the next six months!
856724,Maverick,2014-06-05 01:43:00,371,Still a few weeks away up here but I am pumped!
856731,Rizzo,2014-06-05 02:01:00,4754,"oh ya...haven't had the boat out yet, but off to LSC for 3 days next week. Can't wait."
856777,outllaw,2014-06-05 13:19:00,1232,busy here getting baits ready back to there owners. . painting and deliveries. no opener for me
856782,Gregoire,2014-06-05 14:00:00,1397,I'm heading out to Pigeon as well on Sunday. Hopefully will find some fish.
856790,lew,2014-06-05 15:16:00,12766,I almost never fish the Kawarthas anymore so I  probably won't be chasing any muskies till I'm on Nippissing the week of June 21st.
856796,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2014-06-05 17:23:00,535,"Can't wait to start chasing after that elusive 50""er again!"
856797,SirWhite,2014-06-05 17:26:00,210,Woohoo opener weekend! Thousands of dollars later its finally here!
856837,SuperDave,2014-06-05 22:23:00,204,"I almost never fish the Kawarthas anymore so I  probably won't be chasing any muskies till I'm on Nippissing the week of June 21st. I hear ya Lew. It's a once a year thing with a few of the boys from MCI. Just a great way to spend opener with good fishing buddies and a few brewskies. I spent enough time there in the early years and have moved up to the ""trophy waters""."
856841,lew,2014-06-05 22:43:00,12766,"I live right in the heart of the Kawarthas Jack, but last year I think I only fished these waters maybe 3 times. Still makes for an enjoyable day around here but there's just too many small fish and I'd much rather catch one big fish than a dozen little guys."
856869,Tom McCutcheon,2014-06-06 01:08:00,627,There is at least one 50 inch fish in the Kawartha's to bust your cherry Dave.  See you tomorrow night.
856909,cowanjo,2014-06-06 12:36:00,249,Could not wait drove to Wisconsin _ Fishing Boot lake today - good luck on the season guys. Roaring Dan leave my musky alone. Lets get some picture up to make this a fishing site again!
856920,Gregoire,2014-06-06 13:57:00,1397,"Could not wait drove to Wisconsin _ Fishing Boot lake today - good luck on the season guys. Roaring Dan leave my musky alone. Lets get some picture up to make this a fishing site again!  I know where your musky lives, and may not chase her Sunday, unless it seems like there is a hot bite."
856921,Roy,2014-06-06 14:10:00,13728,Good luck everyone! My zone doesn't open 'til next weekend.
856984,Weeds,2014-06-06 23:54:00,782,"Cant wait too. Spooling up a few reels tonight, figure I'll limit myself to maybe a dozen baits and try them in earnest. I'll be on Chemong most likely, if anybody sees a 14 foot camouflaged eyesore, say howdy."
857043,outllaw,2014-06-07 12:23:00,1232,"well I hope all has fun getting in from a musky show at midnite,slows me up. gonna paint/build and try for a weekday. its sorta like being a plumber. my pipes leak but everyone else is fixed up."
