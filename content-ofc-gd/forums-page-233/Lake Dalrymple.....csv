Of course nothing illegal done but it was pretty sad seeing such a rare fish laying on the grass...I understand the trophy thing but there other options available today!!!  Some groups just don't get it!!!"
857450,lew,2014-06-10 12:42:00,12766,"Always possible it died during the fight which is quite common if the angler was using light gear and took a long time to land it.  But as you say though, nothing illegal if was kept on purpose."
857453,lookinforwalleye,2014-06-10 12:57:00,4399,Yes that is possible...there was Musky gear in the boat. They only said it took about 20 minutes to get it in. It's tough for me because I know there are not a lot of musky left in the lake and once there gone that's it there gone!!!
857454,Rizzo,2014-06-10 13:03:00,4754,wow 20 minutes on musky gear? Time to tighten the drag!
857458,lookinforwalleye,2014-06-10 13:12:00,4399,There was walleye gear in the boat aswell they could have got it on lighter tackle!
