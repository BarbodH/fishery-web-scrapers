856935,16 Footer,2014-06-06 17:02:00,191,"I am planning a fishing trip to the West Arm early July. Need some advise as I have never been there before. Where can I launch my 16' aluminum boat and park for 3 days? I am planning to camp out, are there crown land sites or park sites available? I usually fish for Bass, Walleye and Pike, any recommended spots to fish?  Thanks for your reply"
