857142,AdamS,2014-06-08 02:16:00,161,My fibreglass boat has a fair amount of oxidization on the top cap so I was thinking of wet sanding and using 3m marine compound then the restore and wax. I'm hoping this does the trick but I just wanted to know what process you guys use for getting rid of the oxidization on your boats.
857145,zamboniwaterboy,2014-06-08 02:57:00,126,"This line of product works great.  The boat scrub with the marine power mitt are awesome on the oxidation.  A lot less work than wet sanding.  Follow up with two coats of the polish above the waterline , and two coats of Vs721.  I swear by this brand!  Easy to use.  I apply both the polish and the Vs with power buffers.  https://www.auroramarine.com/catalog-vs721-bottom-coat.php https://www.auroramarine.com/catalog-marine-power-mitt.php https://www.auroramarine.com/catalog-premium-boat-shine.php https://www.auroramarine.com/catalog-boat-scrub.php"
857154,Old Ironmaker,2014-06-08 06:38:00,8243,"The simplest, quickest and least labour intensive that I've found is Maguires Marine deoxidizer. Really don't even need to apply it with a buffer. It comes in a blue bottle and runs around 20 bucks each. A very small amount goes a long way. We did a 30 foot Grew over the winter and it came out fantastic. Applied a good coat of Mothers, but it really doesn't look like it needs it but really is required. We use Mothers paste wax on all the Vettes and any glass cars or anything with gel coat. The boat sat for 6 years with all the glass exposed to the elements. We were turned on to it by a friends son that works at a local Marina and swears by it.  I can look for the bottle in the shop when I go there Monday and will give you the exact I.D. for it. Try it before you get into a 3 step process and see what you think, it will cost you 20 bucks to try it."
