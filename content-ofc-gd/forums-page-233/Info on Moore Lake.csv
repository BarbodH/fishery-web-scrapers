443257,chris.brock,2010-03-13 05:33:00,4053,"Hey. Moore Lake has bass and lakers. I'm pretty sure the laker fishing is tough because I only see one or no huts out there anymore, and haven't heard much about guys fishing it. I think it's a natural reproducing lake so the Minden MNR won't stock it, but I'm guessing the natural fish are few and far between. The bass fishing is likely what you would expect for a busy cottage country lake. Some smallies around the hwy 35 bridge in the moving water, some large mouth in green gables. Some stocked rainbows at Elliot Falls. You can also boat into Black Lk in a small boat under hwy 35.  let us know how you do"

857189,chris.brock,2014-06-08 18:24:00,4053,"there's a free public launch off the road to Elliot Falls, then you have to boat up the Gull River to Moore Lake. The channel into East Moores is no problem, deep water, wide channel"
