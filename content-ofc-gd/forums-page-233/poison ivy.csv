Western... working with an incredibly intelligent ER Physician right now... worst case P.I. treatments often do well with tapered doses of oral Prednisone, Calamine lotion, and/or for unblistered sites, Cortisone based creams.  Now that you've got it once, (become sensitive, or more sensitive to it) you will continue to get it.  Poison Ivy reaction occurs within about the first hour of contact with the leaf.  You have about that time to best wash it off with warm soapy water... or cold.  If you touch an area of contact (ie. clothes) and touch somewhere else, (ie, sweaty forehead, weiner, whatever) you are likely to get it there.  If you develop blisters, the fluid within (weeping out) can spread to more sites from that contact.  At the blistered stage there is a low incidence of communicability, higher incidence of you spreading to more areas on yourself.  If clothes worn, or pet remains unwashed, it could cause later reactions in another area.  Smaller incidence of reoccurrence or new sites if say, leaf to clothes to car seat to skin were to happen, but that's slim  Also, with a very small percentage of people poison ivy can ""possibly"" spread internally, and with those people only an internally administered medication will help."

Peterborough is one of the worst areas it seems, but in general it's free standing and short.  More south it is much taller and vines a lot.  Away the best treatment is oral prednisone and a topical cortisone.  You may need to tell the doc that you would like prednisone. I have a repeat prescription. Last time I got it was about this time last year.  Don't cover it.  Keep it dry. Sunlight soap is good for drying it out in the shower.  A hair dryer helps to dry the affected areas out really well and then hit it with the cortisone cream.  You need to taper off the prednisone.  Poison ivy doesn't grow well on the Shield although there are exceptions e.g., east side of Algonquin Park.  I even found it in Edmonton.  Peterborough is bad for it. For working in the yard I have to cover up and be pretty aware of where I am.  I wash my boots with grease cutter and wash hands and ankles if needed with the orange automotive soap.

You cannot pass it on to others - you are not poison ivy. If you scratch it and it gets infected then you have a more serious issue.  The hair dyer is 10x more enjoyable than the hot shower.
