856805,turtle,2014-06-05 18:14:00,274,"One of my favourites but not exactly an outdoor/adventure book is Three Day Road by Joseph Boyden,  Two young bush Cree enlist in WW1 and end up as snipers in the trenches in France.  There's some moose hunting, aboriginal shamanism and pretty accurate accounts of trench warfare. Based loosely on Francis Pegahmagabow who was credited with 378 kills."

Spell-binding to say the least, I have re-read it over 8 times and cant believe what these two brothers endured over the times running a trap line,  temperatures of minus -60  degrees, animal issues, water freezing in the cabin and trees spiltting in half from the cold temps. Fantastic  book. Cheers, NPT1."

856660,kickingfrog,2014-06-04 20:17:00,8333,"John Gierach has a bunch of books that I've enjoyed reading. They're mostly from a fly fishermen's perspective but I don't think someone need's to have fly fished to enjoy them. Easy reading, sort of journal like."
856661,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-04 20:18:00,10439,If you are into fly fishing and trout all of John Gierach's books are great.    Teddy Roosevelt's outdoor books are a really good read also.

Give it a try and I hope you become a life long Farley Mowat fan.  Jim"

I'll definitely re-read this one day in the future.

It's setting is northern Michigan. If you are a fly fisherman, it should be required reading. But any fisherman will get into it. Go to Amazon and take a look at it."

To each their own...  I also love the northern adventure books, and here are a couple of my favorites:  Indian Creek Chronicles by Pete Fromme (Bitteroot Wilderness, Montana) The Houseboat Chronicles by Jake MacDonald (Minaki, Ontario) Paradise Creek by David Scott (deep bush Canada) ....and one more from the chronicles... Kipawa River Chronicles by Scott Sorensen (Kipawa, Quebec wilderness)  I've read and re-read these several times...just great escapes from the push and pull of normal life. Right now I'm reading Northern Wilderness by Ray Mears about bush-whacking in the Canadian boreal forest. Great so far.  Good luck..."

Short humourous stories of his misadventures while enjoying the outdoors. The books are tough to find but he is a Canadian Treasure IMO. The Mississuaga chapter of TU is named in his honour. My favourite quote of his should give you a sense of his humour as it relates to the outdoors  ""A sportsman is one who not only will not show his own father where the best fishing holes are but will deliberately direct him to the wrong ones.""
