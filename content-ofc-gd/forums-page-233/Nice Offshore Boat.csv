857429,craigdritchie,2014-06-10 11:36:00,1586,"The other day Intrepid Marine released a video of their new 475 Panacea offshore fishing boat, powered by four Seven Marine outboards at 557 hp each. Yup, that's a total of 2,228 hp on a fishing boat. Top speed so far is 78 mph or 125 km/hr, which is pretty good for a 47.5-foot boat that's 13 feet wide and weighs nearly 15 tons (boat is approx 21,000 pounds, plus engines at around 1,000 pounds apiece plus about 2,100 litres - or 4,850 pounds - of fuel).  The price? If you have to ask, don't bother. Fact is I don't know, it wasn't announced. Think well into six digits. But I suspect most of us wouldn't even want to buy the gas for this thing. Cool looking boat though. Starting up, it sounds more like a jet plane than a salmon boat.  Enjoy the video.  http://youtu.be/QgXgikf_q10"

857451,bigbuck,2014-06-10 12:50:00,2449,That thing is not normal!!! Crazy boat with obscene hp. 2100 litres of fuel will not go far in that thing if you hammer down on the fun stick. I figure that puppy goes for 300k or so.
857463,OhioFisherman,2014-06-10 13:32:00,6623,Lifestyles of the rich and famous? Too bad fishing had to come to this?
857485,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-10 16:15:00,10439,I wonder how well it back trolls for eyes?
857489,Roy,2014-06-10 16:30:00,13728,"I figure that puppy goes for 300k or so.  The engines alone are $275,600.00 US plus taxes...that would only leave you with $24,400. for a 47' Panacea.  I don't think so."
857495,fishindevil,2014-06-10 17:12:00,6254,roy you beat me to it !!!! that boat is alot more than 300k !!!! more like 1.3 million !!!!!!awesome...

857499,CRUD150,2014-06-10 17:31:00,87,Would I be ok towing this behind my mini-van? Or am I going to need a brake controller and transmission cooler?
857500,grimsbylander,2014-06-10 17:41:00,3016,Oh yeah! I always forget about my damn helicopter! I just don't use it as much as I used to.
857543,crappieperchhunter,2014-06-10 20:48:00,2582,I just don't get it myself
857547,davey buoy,2014-06-10 20:59:00,5505,"The old saying,if you can afford that boat,fuel is the least of your worries.Must be nice!! Crazy jet sound on take off!!"
