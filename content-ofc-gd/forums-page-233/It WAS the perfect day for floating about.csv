857063,misfish,2014-06-07 16:27:00,29133,"My plan with the perfect day with no wind,was to head north and fish from the tube. Get there at 5AM the lakes glass. Get the gear out and ready. Launch the float a boat . Sun rising,water still, and Im in heaven.       I get a hit right off the bat in 10 fow. Oh feels good.Strong little bugger he was. LOL  Sunfish or blue gill?    After about 1/2 hour,I feel like Im leaning to the right a bit in the tube. I,m thinking maybe the weight of the finder battery is doing it. After about another 15 minutes,the lean is getting worse. Check the pontoon and it,s going soft. CRAP.  So start flipping the flippers as fast as I can,and head to shore. There,s a bass boat very close to me so I yell out if he could help me out with a tow in. No problem he says. Thank you sir. BASS BOAT GUYS ARE THE BEST.  Gets me with in 30 ft of the shore and I flip my way the rest of the way. I examine the tube and see no cuts or rips or holes. It,s 1/4 deflated. But it was still very stable. Pump it up  and let it sit for a bit. Seems to be fine.  I decided to just pack things up and go to some shore spots on the way home. I realized I had left my support bar with the mesh at the launch. Walk back to get it and it,s gone.  There was a pike tourny going on,so I left a few notes on some of the windshields. Hopefully someone picked it up and will give me a call.  Pretty bummed out after this day.  Oh well. ."
857064,Ralph Field,2014-06-07 16:49:00,1018,"Always easy to leave something behind, we have all likely done it at least once. Hope you get your desired call."
857067,Terry,2014-06-07 17:09:00,14456,Dang. Hope you get it back.  And you should blow it up at home and let it sit just to be sure
857069,misfish,2014-06-07 17:37:00,29133,"Ya it,s outside. I filled the one chamber. I,ll give it another hour to see. Im wondering if the bungee cords that I use to hold the finder in place,and maybe not tightening the blow hole enough,may of been the factor.  I dont misuse my stuff,so I cant see there being a hole.  If it deflates,I will check the seams.  I have already contacted Classic Accessories by email.  Ya warranty is out the door,but if it is a seam,I hope they can help out.  How was your day? Break anything?        "
857070,Terry,2014-06-07 17:48:00,14456,couple of lakers buddy has his on the smoker already
857073,misfish,2014-06-07 18:44:00,29133,You guys C&K ?  LOL  Good to hear you got your friend on some fish.  Been a couple hours now. The air is holding.
857089,misfish,2014-06-07 19:46:00,29133,"Would seem,I hope,it was human error. The right side seems to be holding air. Damit.  Will be out in the AM,same place,same time. Just no support bar,but Im sure it wont hamper my day."
857094,kickingfrog,2014-06-07 20:25:00,8333,"I say pumpkinseed. We used to call them sunfish but that can be confusing. Bluegills, I think, don't have the red on the gill or at least it isn't as prominent."
857105,Joey,2014-06-07 21:35:00,9122,Well hopefully it was an honest person who picked up your stuff and will give you a call.  Glad you got a tow to shore too.  Hopefully it was just a bit of a leak from the nozzle and it's good to go.  Nice little Pumpkinseed there (I think it's a Pumpkinseed too)

857109,davey buoy,2014-06-07 21:45:00,5505,"That was quite a morning,nice fish!!!!!,hope you get your support bar back,that sucks!"
857111,lew,2014-06-07 21:52:00,12766,Good to hear you got back to shore relatively dry Brian & hopefully someone contacts you about the missing bar.
857118,spincast,2014-06-07 23:10:00,3279,a blow out on the water.  Bummer. But was definitely a beauty day to be out. Hopefully you get your stuff back and can drift away another day. Pumpkinseed
857139,fishnsled,2014-06-08 02:00:00,3520,Looks like a perfect day to be out Brian.  Sorry about your luck the part and hopefully it gets back to you.

857175,misfish,2014-06-08 16:17:00,29133,"Try a piece of pvc and a smal cargo net, you will want the bar  Yup.  Found that out today. Scuffed  a small part of the waders this morning.  But da boat she a float.   Human error.  NO FISH"
