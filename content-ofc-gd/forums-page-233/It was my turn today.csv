857100,davey buoy,2014-06-07 21:21:00,5505,"After Shaun with the 9lb Pike last week,we decided to head to the deep water.Weather couldn't be any nicer. Wind about 5 km/hr. We started jigging in one spot,marking fish but they didn't seem to want to cooperate.Changed location,not as deep,we lost a couple of something and than a 11lb laker decided he wanted my bait. Put up a great fight,and when he came to surface,what a beauty fish. Here's a pick of him,weather permitting.We will do it all over again next Sat.            "
