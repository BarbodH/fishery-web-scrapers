857193,bawbag,2014-06-08 19:08:00,48,Bought a new 859 hd di this year ive had it out a few times and have had trouble with getting the down imaging picture. Friend of mine bought the same unit and I noticed our transducers are different. Ive tried looking up which transducer is the right one but cant seem to find it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. His tranducer is the xnt 9 di i believe(looks like a tear drop) Im not sure which one mine is but looks like a bar of soap.
