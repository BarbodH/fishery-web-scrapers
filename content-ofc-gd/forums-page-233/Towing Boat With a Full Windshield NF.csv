856844,sofabed,2014-06-05 23:04:00,119,When towing a boat with a full windshield do you leave the middle open or closed? I have seen them towed both ways and is there an advantage to one way or the other?
856845,Pikeslayer,2014-06-05 23:07:00,1443,"Mines always closed. Less stress on hinges, supports etc when the ride gets bumpy."
856847,Terry,2014-06-05 23:09:00,14456,closed
856849,spincast,2014-06-05 23:11:00,3279,closed. definitely less drag.
856850,lew,2014-06-05 23:12:00,12766,Mines closed too.
856857,trevy727,2014-06-05 23:47:00,351,I've never seen one towed open. Wouldn't be wise unless you could lock it open. Would risk having it slam shut from a gust of wind
856967,misfish,2014-06-06 20:31:00,29133,"Look at it like this.  Air travels over objects. So a full closed windshield will deflect the air up over smoothly. Now if you have a gaping hole,the air will flow through and push and drag. This putting pressure on the back end.Pushing the rear end of the boat down,adding down force to the trailer wheels.Causing wear and more heat.  I knew watching nascar enough would pay off.LOL"
