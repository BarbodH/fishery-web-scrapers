Nothing happening here at Nanticoke or Pt. Maitland so we are planning on taking a few boats to Ontario to longline. Any reports are appreciated.  We went to Pt. Bruce on Erie last week and came home with some beauty Perch. 40 in total all over 10"", a few over 13"", 5 pounds of beauty fillets. More giant gobies than perch though, have never seen such large gobies, one was 8"" and jet black? Yes it was a gobie.  Thanks ahead of time,  Johnny D"

The water is still very cold comparatively. http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/glcfs/glcfs.php?lake=o&ext=vwt&type=N&hr=00 Good luck if you go, and let us know how it works for ya."
