856377,Fisherpete,2014-06-02 21:13:00,1814,"The plan was simple: catch big carp all weekend. Friday evening : 16/20. Saturday 20/24. Sunday... 1/1. They were nowhere to be seen! Of the 37, six were over 20 pounds, I managed the biggest at just over 22. Also caught two mirrors, a first for me. Several personal bests were smashed. I'll let the pics do the rest of the talking!  Doubleheader... 22+ and a 16.5    The big girl of the weekend        Will with a sun down fish    My first mirror      My second mirror    Paul with one    Andrew sets a PB with a 20+    Andrew with another 20+ - within ounces of his other one    7 year old Callum with his first    Matt with a nice one    Paul with another    33 inches for my team    Another beauty    Callum with another      Fun had by all  On a side note, anyone know if mirrors prefer to feed at night? Both were caught in the dark. "
856378,Joeytier,2014-06-02 21:17:00,3990,Man those mirrors are ugly!  Amazing fishing though

856481,Mike Pike,2014-06-03 19:24:00,1332,"I'm jealous!  I'm still trying for my first Mirror!  What a weekend and what a nice bunch of carp.  I love the long, lean Commons in the pics.  Great specimens.  Way to go everyone!"
856540,BillsTheBassMan,2014-06-04 00:19:00,932,Great job as always Pete.  Fantastic fish.  I don't fish big carp often but the mirrors that I catch seem to be more aggressive than the more common strains.
856550,mike rousseau,2014-06-04 01:07:00,4661,Awesome fishing guys...  I'm a couple days into 7 day stretch of carpin with some guys from New Zealand....  Love this warm weather....
856561,Christopheraaron,2014-06-04 02:38:00,3525,"Awesome! I love the mirrors, way nicer than commons."
856599,BowSlayer101,2014-06-04 13:50:00,296,"nice fish, i don't know why you guys like mirrors so much, theres lots around here but they're REALLY ugly lol."
856611,Mike Pike,2014-06-04 14:49:00,1332,"nice fish, i don't know why you guys like mirrors so much, theres lots around here but they're REALLY ugly lol. I like 'em because I find their mutated scale pattern is like artwork.  Also, they're not as common as the appropriately named 'Common' carp so it will be a nice surprise when( if )I catch one."
856641,jbailey,2014-06-04 18:53:00,866,amazing! those mirrors are disgusting..  congrats on the great weekend!
856691,Fisherpete,2014-06-04 22:59:00,1814,"Thanks all! Love the carping, especially when you can get into the quantity and quality of fish like this right off your own dock. I hope the fishing stays this good all year - lakers on the ice were great, went for whities once and got into them good... went out for crappies twice and found the slabs... catfishing was spectacular... great carping... loving it!  Next report... muskies... 3 days coming up in the Kawarthas for opening weekend!"
856958,hammercarp,2014-06-06 19:29:00,964,Nice. Looks like a great time was had by all.
