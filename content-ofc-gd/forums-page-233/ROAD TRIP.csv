This winter he went and booked, and paid for a bucketlist trip for his Grandmother, himself, and moi. It's something we talked about for a few years, and Rob decided it was time to ""get off the pot"" before it was too late.  Let me tell you, I have been itching to go for weeks. Ritchie's on L Biscotasi for a week of hard fishing, beautiful surroundings and serenity. For those wondering why my mother...  She has the ability to outfish most you boys.  And tied to the reading material thread, I'm taking my old copy of 'Tain't Running No More"" for some night time reading. My way of keeping in touch, in a way, with my dear Grampa."
