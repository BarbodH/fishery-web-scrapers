854459,BillM,2014-05-20 23:08:00,17367," What do you mean by decent Bill?  I had a 14 ft Sylvan that was a very decent tiller. It was all bench seats. One of the best tillers I have ever owned really..I just like the new split.  A boat that's designed for fishing..   Even our old 16ft Smokercraft had a split in the rear for the driver, I don't even wanna think how old that boat is."
854467,Parnelly,2014-05-20 23:34:00,108,"Years ago I had a nice  Strarcraft tiller very similar to this one.  It had a flat floor with a vinyl covering which makes standing and walking around much easier, plus it keeps your feet out of any water in the bottom of the boat.  Storage lockers on both sides that doubled as seats and it keeps the center of the boat wide open so your not hindered by having to step over bench seats to move around.  25 HP with a trolling motor up front and it made a nice little fishing package and I even crossed the full width of Nippissing in it a couple times.  I installed a swivel seat on the rear bench to make sitting for long periods more comfortable.  Just something else for you to consider.   I have a Smokercraft which has the identical layout to that boat. Great craft. Not much more can be said about the design that hasnt already been said."
854485,leaf4,2014-05-21 02:14:00,2466,not a bad looking setup for the price!
854611,Rizzo,2014-05-21 23:12:00,4754,"LOWE! That's the make you want. I also needed a 14 foot boat about some time ago and wanted a side console. I found that Lowe had the best layout and a decent platform up front. Any other make I would not even consider (at that time) because their platforms were tiny. Mine was a 14' Lowe with 25 hp Johnson. Lew's brother had the same boat I recall. For me, it was perfect...until I got a bigger vehicle and garage...then I went for the 16 footer!"
854755,Fisherpete,2014-05-22 21:16:00,1814,"This is my rig, 16' Legend Prosport with 30hp Honda tiller. I have been very happy with it. I love the layout, and it handles rough water pretty well. I added the seats, trolling motor etc. Pretty affordable, even new. I strongly suggest going with a 16 vs a 14 footer, it makes a world of difference.      "
854757,misfish,2014-05-22 21:45:00,29133,Nice set up Pete.  SIMPLE
854777,Sinker,2014-05-22 23:50:00,8692,"Been around boats my whole life. I was almost born on one. In my experience, SIMPLE is BEST! I have a wide open 16ft tiller with a 40hp engine. I can fish bigwater, inland lakes, and 4wd into backlakes with the one rig. Takes no maintenence, fishes like a dream, and gets me where I needd to to at 30mph. Ive had bigger, smaller, more complicated, fancy rigs, but this one I will have forever. Best all around fishing boat for ME. It also makes a hell of a duck hunting boat!!  S."

854804,sneak_e_pete,2014-05-23 02:51:00,540,Whoops...meant to say I 100% agree with that post.  On my 5th boat....have had 12ft with a 6hp to an 18.5ft with a 140hp.  Best boat I ever owned was a 16ft Alumacraft Backtroller (nowadays classic 165) with a 40hp.  Kick myself for selling it and if I find another one...I am buying it!
854832,BillM,2014-05-23 11:46:00,17367,"Great layout in that Legend.  Lots of room to fish, lots of room for gear.  The 'Muskie Whisperer' is pretty funny as well"
854841,pairofgreenhorns,2014-05-23 12:46:00,133,"really like that muskie whisperer, thats the style i am looking for."
854913,Shloim,2014-05-23 20:53:00,515,I'm gonna wait and see what comes up. Old iron maker is helping with a lead in a nice boat . I have a couple of boat rentals booked this summer if I found one I could save on those too

857254,Shloim,2014-06-09 03:51:00,515,Found a boat! She's a beauty!!! 16 foot Lowe side console with a 40 Johnson 2 stroke. Boat us in new condition! Very stoked ! Thanks for all the help and advice folks
854197,Shloim,2014-05-19 12:30:00,515,"Hello to all the good people on this site. I am in the process of selling a couple of water toys in order to buy a boat. I need help though...What I want is a 14 side console (preferred) with an at least 20HP motor. If anyone knows someone selling one Id be interested. But what Id like is all of your thoughts and advice, I need to stay between 3 and 4k.....Do I wait until fall? Im mainly checking kijiji but is there somewhere else I should check out? Help please"
854200,lew,2014-05-19 12:41:00,12766,"Just my opinion, but a 14 is far too small for a side console and you'll lose too much  space with it.  Best to stick with a tiller in smaller boats, but as I said, it's only my opinion."
854202,captpierre,2014-05-19 13:06:00,2521,"Ya, I agree with Lew.  16 ft would be better.  All around better size, especially in bad weather.  Probably want a bigger motor with 16 ft.  At least 3/4 of boat's motor rating.  Might get lucky watching Kijiji.  Gotta look often.  This is peak boat buying season."
854204,Shloim,2014-05-19 13:18:00,515,"Ok then I had similair thoughts on the space issue that the console takes up. But it makes it feel like more of a boat, I'm not completely opposed to  a tiller. But I want to stay within my price range though and 16's in that price range are that much rougher..."
854206,Sinker,2014-05-19 13:34:00,8692,"A buddy of mine just sold a 16ft lund SSV with 30 yammy tiller for $3500, so they're out there.  Consoles are just a waste of space. Nothing like the wide open space and total control in one hand of a tiller anyways  S."
854216,i2cool2fool,2014-05-19 14:52:00,349,I love my 16' with 30 yammy wasted space vessel. Each their own I suppose.  Keep looking and you'll find your new-to-you boat.
854222,Crazy Ivan,2014-05-19 16:02:00,184,"Consoles are nice for trolling/downrigging. I'd hate to try downrigging for salmon with a tiller. But if your only into casting, tillers give you the most space. I've seen consoles on 14's, if your not a big guy, it could work."
854223,Crazy Ivan,2014-05-19 16:03:00,184,What type of fishing do you plan to do?
854235,Shloim,2014-05-19 17:14:00,515,"Mostly casting for now, Fairly new fisherman with limited experience. Only at it for about 3 years. I prefer smaller lakes but would like more options available. Ill be launching solo alot so the in between size of a 14 is what I was thinking. I rented a 14 side console on balsam last summer and was fine with it even in some chop it was ok. Now Im thinking 14-16...."
854241,BillM,2014-05-19 17:33:00,17367,"I'd get a tiller then customize it with casting deck, livewell etc..   You're just using up too much value space just to have a steering wheel + seat.   But if that's what you want, then don't let anyone here tell you different."
854257,irishfield,2014-05-19 19:48:00,26272,"If I was looking for something between a car topper and a full blown 16'r, something like this would fit the bill nicely."
854258,misfish,2014-05-19 20:06:00,29133,I really like that split seat at the stern. Makes for a more comfortable tiller IMO
854260,bigcreekdad,2014-05-19 20:22:00,546,"Just sharing my thoughts. I moved over 12 years ago from a 16' console to a 16.5' tiller. HUGE difference in space....especially if you are casting a lot. Also, if you like to bait fish, the tiller, IMO, gives you much better boat control trying to stay over a spot. And a must with back trolling. My first boat was a 14' Lund with a 25 tiller....it did not take long at all for me to feel it was too small. My next move was the 16' mentioned above.  As for solo launching....I do it all the time with no problem (and I'm a fat senior citizen). My rig is a 16.5' Alumacraft Pro Magnum, with a 60hp Yamaha tiller. Bought it with a 50hp, and traded 4 years ago (after 10 seasons) for the 60.  Let us know what you do. Shopping for a new boat, and making a decision you feel good about is the goal. At least for me, I keep boats way longer than cars.  Also....have fun!!  "
854300,BillM,2014-05-20 00:08:00,17367,"I really like that split seat at the stern. Makes for a more comfortable tiller IMO  Any decent tiller will have this, I don't think I've seen one without.  (Unless we are talking car toppers)   I can't imagine it's fun to steer with one leg over the rear bench."
854316,Sinker,2014-05-20 01:08:00,8692,"I fished out of an exact rig as irish posted last week. Good solid boat, deep, andd stable, but the bench seats bug me....hard to find a plain jane open floor tiller with no benches.  S."
854320,irishfield,2014-05-20 01:16:00,26272,Because that is were the boat gets it's hull strength Shayne... not an easy way around it without going to a full channeled hull with extra floor. Another option...
854334,Shloim,2014-05-20 02:22:00,515,Well if any of you know anyone selling a good boat thats in the $4k range let me know..
854336,porkpie,2014-05-20 02:31:00,2521,I've had tiller boats up to 16 feet all my life.  For the most part I prefer them on all but the nastiest of days!  A tiller is very east to troll and downrig out of as everything is all there beside you.  I used to have dual walker electrics on my 16 footer and it couldn't be simpler!  I would skip the console on that size of rig.  It just gets in the way and really isn't required!  You should be able to pick up a decent 14 with a reliable motor for that money!
854342,bow slayer,2014-05-20 03:32:00,1074,"where are you located,there is a nice Northwoods 14 ft side console with 25 hp merc for sale just down the road from where I work."
