If you'd like to join me, shoot me a pm, first come first serve. If you are in the GTA and want a ride, that may be possible depending on schedule.  I'd love to take someone that maybe doesn't have access to a boat of their own and such. OFC is such an awesome community, I'd like to give back in some way.  I promise I don't bite.  Max"
