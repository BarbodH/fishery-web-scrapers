856655,Scott S,2014-06-04 19:51:00,203,"On my way up to North Bay my travel cover split right down the middle. Does anyone know of a travel cover place. My boat is a 1600 Crestliner Fishhawk  side console.  Or would it be better to go with the cheaper cover, do they work just as good. Thanks Scott"

856673,bare foot wader,2014-06-04 21:03:00,1354,"keep your receipt if you go the crappy tire way, I had to exchange mine twice in one summer before I just got store credit (the second time took a lot of complaining, ""I must have been using it too hard""...had to escalate an email to their corporate service email, the local manager was useless, took about 2 weeks to resolve)...I'd personally spend a bit more on a quality cover the first time  my buddy got a custom made somewhere in ON for 650 shipped, I can't remember the name but I'm sure somebody else here will chime in  could you get your old cover repaired?"
856701,Scott S,2014-06-04 23:46:00,203,Hey thanks Driffter I will go check them out for sure. Bare foot wader the cover is totaled ripped from one end to the other.

856733,Rizzo,2014-06-05 02:03:00,4754,those cdn tire covers go on sale every other week...I know because I have debated buying one ten times in the last 20 weeks!
856742,porkpie,2014-06-05 02:29:00,2521,The cheap grey cordura cover sold at bass pro (can't remember model name) travels and trailers very well and has a 3 year warranty.  I got my monies worth out of it!  Worth looking into.
856748,NANUK,2014-06-05 02:54:00,797,"You get what you pay for, Sunbrella  and top gun are 2 of the best meterials out there, I had a custom Top Gun cover made for my Fish Hawk 10 years ago, fits tight like a glove and doesn't flop around on the highway,( that's what destroys them ) Still looks good and not a stitch has come apart. A very good investment IMO"
856770,mark demmery,2014-06-05 12:01:00,68,"I just had one made for my Crestliner 16 SC.  Had it done at Garys Custom Marine in Cambridge.  Very impressed.  totally agree, you get what you pay for!"
856786,Raf,2014-06-05 14:27:00,3495,I replaced my CT cover after 3-4 years this year.  I usually trailer with it off unless it is raining.  I found it is the UV damage from the sun that destroyed mine.  YMMV
856945,Scott S,2014-06-06 17:51:00,203,Has anyone dealt with empire boat covers. They look to have some good deals and also have a cover that match's my boat. Scott
