It's not too gruesome, but I figured a heads up was called for.  Jayden turned 2 a few months ago and is very aware of everything her big brother does, in particular fishing. A father can only listen to his daughter say: ""I want to go fishing too!"" so often before acquiescing.  Calm Kempenfelt waters made for a smooth launch and boat ride. The action was slow but the little ones had some fish and some snacks.           ""The fish are over there daddy.""          And home before 11am  Somehow while winching the boat onto the trailer I caught my ring finger between the nose roller and the bow of the boat. At least that's what I think happened. I just felt a slight pinch and did even notice until later when I saw the blood that a first I thought was from a fish. Disbelief that I had put my finger(s) in harms way and being preoccupied with getting boat off the launch didn't really allow me to piece together what had happened. Didn't break, or crush, any bones. No apparent muscle injury, just a flap of skin torn off. I cut most of the skin off with scissors and the bag the bag of ice has numbed the pain.  A couple of mildly bloody finger photos:       "
