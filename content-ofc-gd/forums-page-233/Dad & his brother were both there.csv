856951,lew,2014-06-06 18:49:00,12766,Lots of great replies here guys and it appears as if many  of us have much to be proud of today.  It isnt a long drive up to your place so if you are up to some company would love to come up and see you and Diane.  Jim  You know your always welcome here Jim.  Gimme a call this evening after 7 or any time this weekend if you want.
856954,Rodbender,2014-06-06 19:04:00,1027,Great post Lew  My Grandfather went in through Italy when Juno beach was invaded I listened to his stories everytime I could and still do totally eye opening I sat my kids down to hear his stories from there and they were shocked.  My Grandmother was a war bride. Her and my mom came over from Scotland on a ship that landed in NFLD. Grampa came here after his duty and they moved here to Ontario.  A day to Remember for sure I thank all the Vet's for their service so we all have a better life.

857041,mosquito,2014-06-07 11:43:00,111,"Thanks for posting, great pics,  Next weekend it the airshow at the Hamilton airport for those that are interested.  http://www.warplane.com/upcoming-events/event-details.aspx?eventId=25    "
856893,lew,2014-06-06 10:18:00,12766,"My Dad left Saskatchewan & joined the Navy in 1940 to fight the war and his brother went with him and joined the Army. They both fought the Germans for the next 5 years and  both were among the thousands that hit France 70 years ago today.  Dad's ship was in close to the shores of Juno trying to protect the soldiers while his brother was on the beach trying to  get to cover before the German guns killed him.  Dad & his brother both survived that horrible day and went on to live long and wonderful lives, but thousands upon thousands of men were killed fighting for us.  We owe so much to those guys and I for one am proud to say my family volunteered to fight and helped make this world a better place for those of us that followed them.  Dad and his ship    "
856894,Steve,2014-06-06 10:40:00,2075,"Thank you to your dad, your uncle, and all the rest of the brave Canadians who forged their way up the beach on that horrific morning.  November 11th is the day of rememberance, but today is also an extremely important day in Canadian history.  The sunrise was a little brighter this morning due to all those who were lost shining down on us."
856895,ketchenany,2014-06-06 10:42:00,3229,We remember them everyday for what we have. Thanks for posting.
856896,spincast,2014-06-06 10:47:00,3279,"My family was in the UK at the time (before mine), but I went back to school there for a few years. Memories run deep in our family as well.  As  child I visited the pill boxes on the shores of the English channel and saw the tank traps. Everyone I knew pretty well  lost someone; a father, an uncle. Thanks to all who braved the horrors of that day that we may live as we do today.  An important day indeed."
856898,outllaw,2014-06-06 10:55:00,1232,LEW those were great men that gave us what we have t-day. I always say thanks to vets Everyday that have given us freedom.
856899,fishindevil,2014-06-06 11:12:00,6254,they are all heros in my book lew !!!! every single person who served is a true hero !!!! and its sad that there are not many left..... the greatest sea invasion of all time D-DAY
856900,Roy,2014-06-06 11:20:00,13728,"We should never forget.  Side note, Lew have you ever seen the film ""Corvette K-225"" ?"
856901,lew,2014-06-06 11:24:00,12766,Yes I have Roy.  The real name of K225 was HMCS Kitchener but in the movie it was called HMCS Donnacona
856902,muskymatt,2014-06-06 11:39:00,2608,Heros! Thank you!
856903,bushart,2014-06-06 11:53:00,2628,Definition of Courage
856905,Joey,2014-06-06 12:00:00,9122,"Thanks for posting this Lew, we all need to remember.  Thank you to  your father and uncle.  My grandfather also was there, only in a different capacity.  He was a  plane mechanic and fixed and maintained the planes that fought in that war.  He also made it but my Grandmother could not speak of that day without crying every time."
856907,Tim Mills,2014-06-06 12:10:00,476,"Great pictures Lew.  Its impressive what your Dad and Uncle and they're generation did for us.  My father enlisted at 17 and was a flight instructor for the navy. My neighbour  as  a kid, drove a landing craft on d day , was shot on his first drop off but continued to do several more trips on d day."
856908,bushart,2014-06-06 12:15:00,2628,"I personally have known Vets from this time---so, so many had difficulties dealing with this for the rest of their lives  One telling me  (back in the 70's)---of waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat remembering---they never forgot  Now we have a term...PTSD---back then it was a different era...I guess go home and work it out?  And even my mother worked in an airplane factory in Kingston during the war  My wife has a collection of letters home from her uncle---who went in the beginning and stayed till the end----one afternoon we sat and read all the letters  You could sit and read the difference in his personality from happy and joking in the start---to letters near the end where it was much different.  I listened to many vets and am fortunate to have heard their stories----soon there'll be none left to tell"
856914,Pigeontroller,2014-06-06 13:14:00,2793,We ALL need to NEVER forget the sacrifices made by those young men.
856918,doubleheader,2014-06-06 13:34:00,497,"Great post Lew.  If one wants to imagine what it was like that day for those brave young men storming the beach, just close your eyes. Imagine you're on an amphibious troop transport. The waves are causing it to lurch and the stench of vomit is in the air. The men around you are sick. Some are seasick, some are sick from the sound of artillary rounds bouncing off the armour. Suddenly the gate drops, and if you are one of the lucky ones you scramble out. If you are really lucky you find some cover on the beach. If you make it off the beach alive you will never be the same person.  I served in the Navy many years ago, but I cannot imagine the bravery of these young men. In my book, heros all."
856922,lew,2014-06-06 14:13:00,12766,"  I served in the Navy many years ago,  Yeah, me too Fred and although I went to France a couple times   in the 60's we never had time to go to the Beaches although it was something I would have very much liked to have done.  I did however see the German sub pens in Brest France and just the sight of them invoked thoughts of the terror those U-boats brought to so many men."
856925,OhioFisherman,2014-06-06 14:51:00,6623,"Dad was 101st airborne, if you think parachuting is fun? Try it with people shooting at you!  The 6th of June, a day to remember."
856926,glen,2014-06-06 14:55:00,2641,Thanks for putting this up Lew. My grampa made it back his brother didn't. I spent a few rememberence days with grampa and it was quiet. He was canadian army and was all over Europe.  He didn't talk about D day but I have a few stories.  One was about the shock and terror that the allies felt when the HMS Hood was sunk.
856927,lew,2014-06-06 14:59:00,12766,"If I recall my history correctly Glen, I think only 3 men survived the Hood sinking."
856931,Maverick,2014-06-06 16:06:00,371,"My great grandfather lost his leg in WWI and my grandfather enlisted into the Navy at the age 16 in WWII. He never did say much about his time in the Navy but that was not uncommon. Watching the ceremonies in Normandy makes you realize how lucky we are to have the freedom we have. My thanks to all the Veterans and those still serving, you will never be forgotten."
856933,fishnsled,2014-06-06 16:36:00,3520,Great post Lew and many thank to all!!  Will never forget what they sacrificed for us.
856937,registerfly,2014-06-06 17:21:00,198,thanks for this Lew.  
856939,davey buoy,2014-06-06 17:23:00,5505,"Great post as well Lew,I will never forget as well ,what I have today and do not want to think about had the tables been turned.Heros forever!!!"
856944,mistyriver1,2014-06-06 17:45:00,600,Great post Lew.  Have been thinking about my Dad alot today too Lew.  He was part of D Day plus 3 and was lucky enough to come back and lived a long life as well.  I owe you a phone call soon and hope we can share a boat soon too.  Sorry I've been a stranger.  It isnt a long drive up to your place so if you are up to some company would love to come up and see you and Diane.  Jim
856947,porkpie,2014-06-06 18:27:00,2521,My grandfather was on HMCS Ottawa from 42 to the end of the war.  His brother served on a Corvette.  I still have gramps paybook his navy knife and  a bunch of his kit as well as his discharge papers.  I also have some papers that washed up from one of the 3 confirmed Uboats that they sank in the channel during the summer of 1944 after running escort duty for landing forces.  An rather depressing but vivid reminder of history.  Hopefully something we never repeat.
