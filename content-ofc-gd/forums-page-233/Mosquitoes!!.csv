I am usually a stickler for closing the cabin door quickly. It got so bad that there were as many leaving as there were trying to get in.  I even got bit while taking a shower.  On the positive side, the black flies were not an issue this year and the UF was as beautiful as ever."

856744,Big Cliff,2014-06-05 02:31:00,6899,Tried one of those mosquito magnet things a couple of years ago. Had a lot of problems getting it to work but when we could get it to keep going we did get a lot of mosquitos (I would say we averaged between 1/4 and 1/2 cup every evening). We ended up having to take our unit back about 5 times for exchange and finally gave up and got our money back.  I ended up buying one of the fogger units and that really helped. I would fog the yard and surrounding bushes and we could sit/work outside for about three hours. Not too sure how good it is for the environment but we had to do something.

You can buy one for less than you would spend on Muskol and Afterbite over the course of a summer, it will last for years, and you simply won't get bit.

I still needed the DEET but 300mg in the morning and evening seemed to make a real difference.  I also found that the B1 SEEMED to stop ticks from biting.  There were lots of ticks along the creek and the one day I actually picked about (didn't start counting until about 20) 75 by my count off me.... still gives me the creeps, I now stay out of the tall grass no matter how good the pool looks!   Not one bit, but my dad had stopped taking the B1 and had 3 ticks and all 3 had bit.  For the back yard we have a mosquito magnet, I just checked it after 3 days and the trap was half full... that's nuts! That is hundreds of mosquitoes!. I should have taken a pic yesterday and I just went and got it again, not many compared to the last bunch but it gives you the idea.  It attracts alot of mosquitoes to the area so even going near the trap is like something out of a horror show.  "

The trout streams I fish are just swarming with giant mosquitoes. You would have to bathe in DEET to not get swarmed. Hands are still exposed though but it could be a lot worse.  I have a thermacell but I'm still on the fence about its effectiveness (especially out in the open).  Last year I bought a few of the Simms NoFlyZone shirts that were heavily discounted. I haven't really put them to the test yet.  On my next trip to the states, I'm looking to pick up some repellent made with picaridin. Apparently it doesn't melt plastic or synthetic clothing like DEET does and is just as effective. I would be devastated if I saw my camera equipment start to melt."

We have tons of skeeters in the SW corner of Ontario this year also. Last night I could only manage to pick worms for 20 min before getting eaten (yes I'm out of camp fog right now)  For heading into the bush I used stuff called decca it was in a brown labeled spray can and worked great. I now have MAXX deet it sure does the trick but don't use to much just a bit.

856247,Tootsie II,2014-06-02 01:06:00,162,The mosquito's were the worst I've ever seen in Northeastern Ontario last year. Sounds like that may be the case again this year. I for one believe it is in large part caused by that wicked white mouth fungus that has greatly reduced the bat population over the last few years.

I'm still covered in blackfly bites and now the skeeters are out big time !!!! Have not seen them this bad in a long time !!!!!

The mosquitoes are the worst I have ever seen. coils burning, themocell inside etc..top of my head is a mess of lumpy bites. I find Afterbite (or anything with ammonia) helps control the itch.  anyone have experience with these CO2 generators ? thinking of one for the yard so the evenings aren't a total write-off."
856289,lew,2014-06-02 11:42:00,12766,I took a coffee out on the back deck about 5:30 this morning and was absolutely swarmed by the skeeters.  Now I've been working in the yard since 6:30 and haven't seen a single one in the last hour.

The breeze from the fan usually keeps the little burgers at bay; step off the deck and you had better start running.

I'd be interested in giving it a shot since we already run a solar system that I could easily access.  http://youtu.be/pU2kbghz85I  Basically, use a powerful barrel fan with a mess covering the intake.
