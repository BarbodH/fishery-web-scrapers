Images are heavily cropped (apologies) because the fish came from water that was graciously shown to me. Thanks Solo.        I'll toss a few more up when I get them uploaded online.  Cheers."

640345,12footspringbok,2011-11-15 19:54:00,459,Nice fish. I like the pink colour on the second pic in. I don't know if its just my crappy camera or something else that I'm missing because I never seem to be able to capture that rosy colour on the fish.
640348,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-15 20:03:00,10439,Nice fish Kemper. Got a pretty good idea where they were caught.
