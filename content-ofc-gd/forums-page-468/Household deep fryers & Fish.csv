640615,bigugli,2011-11-16 21:37:00,6138,BBQ them with a last minute melt of havarti or jack cheese
640617,Billy Bob,2011-11-16 21:41:00,5865,"This weekend I will be rapping 1"" cubes of duck and goose breast with a hot pepper and B A C O N ....then placed on skewers and cooked on the BBQ at deer camp....probably wouldn't get a deer, but we'll eat good."
640618,mercman,2011-11-16 21:41:00,7054,Now i dont know what to do I will do them half and half and let ya know which is best
640620,Blue Lk,2011-11-16 21:46:00,337,"In regards to bacon wrapped walleye,I've found frying better than BBQ or oven,by the time the bacon is cooked in oven or BBQ,the fish is overcooked.Imho"
640623,bigugli,2011-11-16 21:58:00,6138,You yanks don't know what real bacon is.
640626,Billy Bob,2011-11-16 22:01:00,5865, Yes we do...it's you Canucks that are fooled eating ham thinking it's bacon...it's not B A C O N unless it's the real McCoy..
640631,misfish,2011-11-16 22:12:00,29133,"  Rob, you got my vote.  Bruce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  FISH AN BRUSE.  Ya aint deep frying that."
640635,Big Cliff,2011-11-16 22:36:00,6899," I'll second that! Fryer is the better way to go!  I have done them on the BBQ a couple of times, when I do I spritz them with Italian salad dressing. BBQ them on high heat and wrap slightly larger pieces of fish, it helps to keep it from over cooking too much.  As far as the oil thing is concerned; when we do a fondue we use peanut oil so there is no flavour transfer between the things we are doing. I guess it would too expensive to use for larger applications and probably not too good for people with peanut alergies."
640662,mercman,2011-11-16 23:52:00,7054,"  Well, i must say, that was excellent. I tried the maple syrop, and it was fantastic Who would have thought that walleye and maple syrop would go well together An i deep fried it. Deep fried bacon Yummmm, i can feel my arteries hardening already."
640704,bigugli,2011-11-17 02:21:00,6138, Near as fine a blue water recipe as fish head soup. Hard tack would be bruised and boiled to serve up with such other favourites as pemmican and bully beef
640726,camillj,2011-11-17 03:34:00,1988,... ooo OOO Mmmmm Bacon wrapped doggy do-do .... a nice light snack
640735,Hooked,2011-11-17 04:54:00,891,"I don't cook my fish in the deep fryer, but try using peanut oil.  Apparently one of the advantages of using it is that it apparently does not retain the flavor of previously cooked foods in it.  Oops, didn't see BigCliff's above reply."
640744,pikehunter,2011-11-17 10:35:00,1659,"Actualy Billy we didn't call it Canadian Bacon, the Brits named it in the war. The rations were sent overseas and nobody knew what to call it so the term Canadian Bacon was coined and it stuck.  What is the one thing Canadian you can buy in the states that you can't find here? Or at least rarely, Canadian Bacon. Go figure eh. Up here we call it back bacon."
640745,Billy Bob,2011-11-17 10:44:00,5865," THANKS, always wonder where that name came from....  Bob"
640749,pikehunter,2011-11-17 11:32:00,1659,"NP Billy, years ago I couldn't figure out why I couldn't find Canadian Bacon in the stores? Heard about it on the TV but couldn't get it. Wondered what the hell it looked like and thought wow! It must be really really special! Then I found out from my mother that C.Bacon and back bacon were the same thing, man I felt like an idiot. A few years ago I read an article about it and the previous post I made sums it up."
640776,Fish Farmer,2011-11-17 13:27:00,2234,"MAN"" You guys got nothin better to do than talkin eats. You makin me hungry, my Thurs. just turn into Friday. I hope the wife wants fish for her birthday today.  Dead Man Walkin"
640779,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-17 13:36:00,2582, Now that made me laugh ....cause Debbe loves her steak. If I did give her fish for her birthday I'm pretty sure no one here would ever see or hear from me again.
640298,Lunker777,2011-11-15 16:53:00,866,"Hey everyone  I found a sweet deep frier on Kijiji..... The guy tells me it has been used to cook perch.... ""Only used one time"" is what it says in the ad.  I have been told once you cook fish in a deep frier, its pretty well ruined.... and can only be used for cooking fish. I was told it holds the taste of the fish and any other food you cook will have a fishy taste to it ??? How true is this statement ???  The filters would most likely need to be changed because they would smell like fish right ???  Thanks  Its a stupid question I know."
640301,mercman,2011-11-15 16:59:00,7054,"I use a deep frier and any taste/odor stays in the oil, not in the appliance.The one i own has a permanent filter in the cover.All i do is put the lid in the dishwasher and it is cleaned.  "
640302,mike rousseau,2011-11-15 17:00:00,4661,i think that statement has to do with oil...  if you cook fish...then chicken... the chicken gets the fish taste...  if you clean it out well you should be good...  if what you heard was true.... that would mean the metal/plastic absorbs the flavor and transfers it to all the other food...  i havent experienced this...
640303,Lunker777,2011-11-15 17:05:00,866,Alright thanks guys !  I know the smell can sometimes stick in the filters in the lids..... but I just wasnt sure about the taste thing.  Answered my questions..... I shall purchase the deep frier hahah  Thanks again !
640304,Billy Bob,2011-11-15 17:10:00,5865,Taverns around here make their living serving chicken wings (deep fried) all week long....but the taverns that have a great fish fry on Friday's only will not serve wings that day because they are using those fryers for fish.
640323,bigugli,2011-11-15 18:35:00,6138,"It's all about flavour holding in the oil. Thtaste of fish is not embedded in the fryer. There is a way to remove the fish taste/odor from the oil. When you finish cooking your fish, you clarify your oil by frying a batch of taters. The taters, due to some chemical process. absorb or neutralize the residual flavours. Works quite well. Not every kitchen has a separate fryer for fish. You have a fryer bank for meat, and one for taters, rings, etc...  YOu would be amazed at how many restaurants precook their breakfast sausage and bacon in the fryer."
640327,Headhunter,2011-11-15 18:52:00,5703,"I'd heard the potato trick before, but that brings to mind a question... my mother in law is very much allergic to shell fish. should I cook up a batch of shrimp, do you think the potato trick would remove the shell fish problem from the oil? I wouldn't try it, but I am curious... HH"
640330,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-15 19:02:00,2582, Mother in law you say..hmmm...I say give it a go  What are you really out
640340,bigugli,2011-11-15 19:37:00,6138,"Clarifying the oil, to my knowledge, merely eliminates the fishy flavour in the oil. It will not remove any actual bits or scraps of meat left in the oil."
640347,Headhunter,2011-11-15 20:01:00,5703,I beleive that it's the oils in the shell fish that cause allergic reactions... so I am guessing that the spud won't do it. HH

640505,kman,2011-11-16 10:02:00,15,    mmmhh   bacon    
640506,pikehunter,2011-11-16 10:27:00,1659,"Knew a fellow years ago that owned a fish and chip shop back in th 60's. Said that every time they changed the shortening in the fryer he'd toss a whole onion in and fry it to the point of just about burning it and this would ""flavour the oil."""
640507,Billy Bob,2011-11-16 11:09:00,5865,Don't know if the potato cures the flavor of fishy oil but it kind of makes sense....did you ever make soup or anything else and put in too much salt by mistake....a whole peeled potato added will save the day....
640513,mercman,2011-11-16 12:29:00,7054,  that sounds real tastey. Ever try it?
640526,Jer,2011-11-16 13:29:00,1426,"  Well they're not walleye, or deep fried for that matter. We call them crappie delights...       "

640558,rob v,2011-11-16 18:19:00,535,great subject (eating is one of my favorite pass times !).   When frying fish -  how do you know it's time to change the oil and/or how many times can you reuse the same oil ??
640572,bigugli,2011-11-16 18:59:00,6138,"It depends on 2 things.  1)  Are you straining all the sediment out of your oils after using?  2) Temperature you are frying at. The hotter you fry, or the more fatty your meats, the quicker the oil will darken. Get your oil to the point of burning/smoking, and i would throw the oil out. Bacon and sausage cause the oil to darken very fast, unless you fry a lot of potato with it. Truth is, you want a little  colour in your oil to get that golden brown. Nothing worse than doing fries in new oil."
640603,mercman,2011-11-16 20:45:00,7054,This thread keeps getting better and better. Just so happens i took a couple of packs of walleye out of the freezer.I want to do the bacon thing.Would it be better in the oven or my deep fryer?   
640606,kickingfrog,2011-11-16 21:04:00,8333," I vote for the fryer, but the oven/bbq method is ""healthier"" and still really good."
640607,mercman,2011-11-16 21:07:00,7054, Dang .....now i'm drooling over here.Gonna try it in the fryer.
