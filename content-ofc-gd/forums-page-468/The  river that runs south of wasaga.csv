I guess the water still needs to get colder.Going to try again this Saturday,but noticed very few people out last Saturday on a very nice day. What do you guys think?. Is it the calm before the storm?. Any ideas,or comments?. Thanks davey.For someone who pm'd to my post,no specifics were given,either help or not!"
