640379,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 22:13:00,11391,"@ Randy, I looked up a story from Kare11 on this, and turns out your absolutely right. I think they tested 10 places advertising walleye and almost all of them turned out to be Zander. And one guy said the price difference is $2 per lb less for Zander. They gave an example of one place that sold 50,000lbs per year, so it looks like money saving is def. the goal here. Makes me wonder if any of my local restaurants are doing the same thing?  Good points kicking frog, overfinesse and overthink, two major faults anglers can come across at times"
640445,Dutchy,2011-11-16 01:11:00,416," Nah sorry I don't, it was a good few years ago now. I caught it at a place called Limpley Stoke just outside of Bath in England. The fishing was amazing, big chub, barbel, tench, zander, bream, roach, lots of big coarse fish. Highly recommend that area for anyone who wants to try their hand at it."
640197,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 03:37:00,11391,"I'm determined to take a trip sometime in my life to fish these beasts. I can't imagine reeling in 109cm fish that looks almost identical to it's cousin walleye.  Has anyone here had the pleasure of catching these fish?  My link   109cm   The guys that constantly bicker over walleye/pickeral will love these being added to the mix, lol"
640198,NAW,2011-11-15 03:40:00,4022,Never herd of this fish before.  Looks like one hell of a fighter though!
640200,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 03:46:00,11391,"  I agree!  It looks like a trip to Sweden or Russia is in order to catch them though (or other areas of Europe)  Basically the same as a walleye (Sander Vitreus) but has an ability to grow longer/fatter. Some of the big ones I've seen in pictures have some ugly coloring, but others look beautiful, and identical to walleye.  Some of the rigs I've seen used to catch them are quite odd too, at least to me  "
640203,dave524,2011-11-15 03:59:00,4508," Come on, be realistic, it looks like a Walleye"
640204,mike rousseau,2011-11-15 04:01:00,4661,I find the fins look like plastic...  I've seen people try and pass these fish off as walleye on other fishing sites...
640205,bigugli,2011-11-15 04:03:00,6138,"My granparents loved Ontario when they first came here. Not only did the landscape look like home (Finland), many of the fish were the same, albeit smaller. Pike, perch and zander in abundance."
640215,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 05:31:00,11391," lol, I could see some  doing that."
640239,mike rousseau,2011-11-15 12:26:00,4661,Makes you wonder if you went over with our style lures and techniques for walleye... If you'd get Zander...
640243,mercman,2011-11-15 12:44:00,7054,  So when do we book a trip Mike I have no doubt you could figure out a pattern. I hear a guy by the name of Colonel Zanders has a chain of restaurants featuring the fish deep fried
640246,Roy,2011-11-15 13:12:00,13728," Actually, we're using their style of lures. Rapala originated in Finland. For all intents and purposes, they are the same fish. Remember the Latin name for walleye was recently changed from Stizostedion vitreum to Sander vitreus.   Many North American restaurants have been and still do serve zander and call it walleye."
640248,bigugli,2011-11-15 13:13:00,6138,What do you think Rapala lures were originally patterned for? There's no bass where the original lures were designed.
640265,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 14:42:00,11391," I would imagine so, all the listed characteristics etc are virtually the same as walleye.  I seen one rig pop up in alot of the videos, and I was pretty surprised it would be effective. It was a heavy ball sinker, I'd guess 3-5 oz., with a swivels attached to it. The straight on the swivel was either a grub or what appeared to be 4"" swim baits.  I f I was to use a similar rig in heavy current (like I seen this rig being used on), I'd use a leader of some sort to keep my presentation off bottom a bit, and get it further from such a big sinker.  It would be fun to get the chance to try out North Amrican techniques though   "
640283,Cosmos,2011-11-15 16:10:00,588,  I have this rig - brought it from my Belarus trip. If you guys interested i can put some pictures here. Tried it on French River couple of times and got one smallmouth. I hope we are talking about same thing This is how is it made: 
640290,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 16:32:00,11391," Nope, thats a different rig then I was referring too. I'm glad you posted that though, as it was another rig I came across while searching out this topic!  I think the one I'm talking about was called a porolonka rig? I could be mistaken though   "
640293,Cosmos,2011-11-15 16:39:00,588,  Whatever i posted is a porolonka.
640295,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 16:44:00,11391," haha, shows what I know!  Here is an image close to the other method  My link     "
640308,Cosmos,2011-11-15 17:18:00,588, That's the one.
640313,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 17:39:00,11391,accept the ones I seen previously had much larger sinkers. I suppose it depends on the current
640358,Muskieman,2011-11-15 20:47:00,2472,"You can buy these fish at ""Sysco"" or many grocery stores under the name of ""European Pickerel"" tastes and looks just like Walleye and cheaper than buying them at the ""fish market"".....  If I'm not mistaken restauranteurs in Minnestoa were charged for selling them as Walleye. (zander vitreus vitreus).....  I've always wanted to go to Holland and try my luck... apparently the average Zander is larger than our average Walleye (excluding Quinte) and the world records for both species are pretty close.   Randy "
640363,Cosmos,2011-11-15 21:28:00,588,"Whatever i have is coming with 1 oz sinker, but you are right, for different condition you are putting different weight, to change sinker you are using small split ring."
640365,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 21:37:00,11391," As for size, I think they grow quite abit bigger. The fishid site I was looking at said maximum length of 51"", max weight of 33lbs. But I've seen a few pics now of pikeperch that ""appear"" to be larger than that. And on some of those pics, the girth of them look greater than that of our walleye.  Thats interesting what you say about restaurants in MN selling them because there cheaper? Walleye are obviously abundant in MN, and you'd think that fish shipped from various parts of Europe wouldn't really be any cheaper? Interesting though, and I'm bored, so I'm gonna try to find some links to these cases.  @Cosmos. It's a funny rig to me. I fish alot of walleye and I'd never think to have a large sinker so close to the bait. I'd use a leader or something similar to keep the bait away from the sinker. Just looking at those rigs I think ""that would never produce bites"", lol. Shows how close minded we can be at times as anglers"
640366,mercman,2011-11-15 21:43:00,7054, Hey ! That would be a great place for an OFC G2G !!!
640369,Dutchy,2011-11-15 21:51:00,416,"I've caught one, but in the UK. Used a swimfeeder with maggots. They fight pretty damn hard, way more so that walleye."
640370,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 21:53:00,11391,"  Aweosme, thats really cool! Any chance you have a pic?"
640372,kickingfrog,2011-11-15 21:57:00,8333,"Sometimes we finesse too much for walleye. The fish are not hitting our presentation so we go lighter or longer because they must be ""finessed more"". That isn't always the best option.  The conditions also dictate the presentation. The river anglers in the mid and western states use some rigs that would make most of us eastern anglers do a double take.  That heavy ball sinker offers the same type of precise presentation that a jig would but the hook can swing a little more freely and the weight can be changed more quickly than a whole jig-head."
