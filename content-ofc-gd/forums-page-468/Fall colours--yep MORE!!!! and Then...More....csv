636420,BillM,2011-11-01 01:42:00,17367,"Nice fish, can't beat those Erie tribs for numbers"
636459,hawk-eye,2011-11-01 07:24:00,141,"Was out on an Erie trib on Sunday, water was still brown, only about 6"" vis. Fished about an one mile stretch with no luck.  Good work out there, the young lad looks like he knows what hes doing. Nice to see the younger gen in the water."
639526,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-12 15:44:00,0,"And then sometimes you just have to ""settle"" for some Atlantics..."
639805,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-13 22:35:00,0,"And then again, when one has had enough of Salar...  Catt was like a dream--mint green, visibility 24-36 inches. One would think paradise, alas, the fish were few and far between and not taking.  Jump in the car, off to another river--water moss green, clear, nice holding pools, new rig, small patterns--BINGO!!  You never know--everyone else was skunked there.  Hard, fresh, beautiful fish...     Keep the reports and pics coming brothers and sisters, comrads and friends.."
639895,Paulus,2011-11-14 02:45:00,522,And it's such a nice river to fish! Thanks for sharing  p.-
640583,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-16 19:32:00,0,No more--for reasons that shall remain unsaid in this public forum.  Best of luck this season.
640590,I'mHooked,2011-11-16 19:54:00,525,Huh? What happened to the pictures?    Sounded like a good outing?
640605,blaque,2011-11-16 20:54:00,2419,Strange
640636,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-16 22:37:00,0,"Hey ""Hooked""  Thanks for checking in brother! Well you know how it goes--things can sour with the failure of reciprocity, perchance an opportunity for a conversation elsewhere (preferably on the water, were one able to name such a river).  Nuff said.  Keep chasing Oncorhynchus mykiss man...."
