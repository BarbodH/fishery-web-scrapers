640128,tonka-toy,2011-11-15 00:32:00,139,"Ran into Ron (of Coburg harbour fame) on the river today..  Ron and I had never met before and I was fishing along side a father and son when he arrived. The father had just finished explaining to me that his son had been begging him to take him rainbow fishing and although he didn't know that much about rainbow fishing, they set out to see if they could catch a few. It was late in the afternoon and it was their 2nd day of watching hundreds of fish being caught and they still had yet to get a bite. Mr Ron steps out of his car and within a few drifts promptly hooks about a four pound rainbow. He immediately turns to the kid and asks him if he'd like to fight this fish.. the young guys eyes nearly popped out of his head as he screamed yeeesss!! and he proceeded to land his first ever rainbow. I was lucky enough to have a hit next and following Ron's lead, let him land his second rainbow, about 7 pounds. Shortly after Ron followed that up by letting the young guy land his third. The father and son thanked Ron and myself many times to which we shared a few tips for future trips and they called it a day and left. I spent the next half hour talking to Ron about rainbows and muskies and fishing with our kids before the rain chased us from the creek.  Over the last four days fishing this spot, friends and I have enjoyed great success for steelhead but unfortunately witnessed a lot unsportsman like behaviour (like littering, many racial slurs etc) but meeting Ron and seeing the interaction between him and this father and son kinda reminded me of what fishing's all about. Just thought I'd share and pass along my thanks to Ron for reminding me......"
640134,mike rousseau,2011-11-15 01:00:00,4661,I met ron on Saturday...  First class guy...  Talked about issues I had with law enforcement at a local marina in my boat...  Great guy...
640150,Handlebarz,2011-11-15 01:24:00,3790,dang seems like a pattern here LOL just ask his daughter how nice he is he even gives his daughters first place trophy's away for her. Well my daughter had to work for it but all the same.  Stand up friend for sure and am very glad to call him a true friend and sportsman.
640157,BillM,2011-11-15 01:38:00,17367,"Ron, next time give Muskie Mike the rod  :)"
640161,Paulus,2011-11-15 01:40:00,522,"Thanks for sharing that. We hear about the negative stuff all too often, so it's nice to hear about the really good stuff. Both you guys are to be commended.  p.-"
640163,misfish,2011-11-15 01:43:00,29133,"Ron,ever thought of running for the head of the MNR? Im not joking here.Your the kind of guy we all need.  Rons a great guy. I have had the pleasure as well to fish with him."
640173,Remastered,2011-11-15 02:27:00,143,Steelheading really does need more selflessness. I guess a lot of things do.
640174,mike rousseau,2011-11-15 02:30:00,4661,  :clapping:  :clapping:  i just wanted to feel the power of steel...lol  i tried bribing him with very low priced musky tackle...
640310,capt bruce,2011-11-15 17:27:00,820,"When I was young and before being a father all the fish I hooked WERE MINE !!! after my first child all the fish I hooked were theirs . Ron is the best, someone to look up to, a role model we all should resepct and learn from  ."
640376,BillM,2011-11-15 22:07:00,17367, I dunno about you but 99% of the guys I meet on the river are there to have a good time and usually are more then willing to lend a helping hand.
640395,Garnet,2011-11-15 22:36:00,2056,"Chatted to Ron a week ago. The only thing I got was Mallissa's Abuse's. ""That's a weak hook set"". ""You got Lucky"" and much more."
640398,misfish,2011-11-15 22:45:00,29133, Here here. Nice one Bill.
640400,Remastered,2011-11-15 22:55:00,143, Wha
640402,d_paluch,2011-11-15 23:03:00,343,"Teach me teach me!  Good going guys! I am maybe a 2 min walk from Bronte creek....and that is something I have never seen before. I gotta start fishing for trout/salmon! Teach me OFC, teach me!"
640403,Remastered,2011-11-15 23:06:00,143, That's the river though. When I come online it's just messed up to the max lol
640430,esoxansteel,2011-11-16 00:28:00,1307,"Ron makes one hell of a great Ceasar too  or Seizures  just watch he doesnt throw bananas in your boat.  makes great double ski planer boards as well, congradulations to both of you for helping to make a father and sons day."
640441,danc,2011-11-16 01:00:00,4677," Yup. He should sell his recipe to the Clamato Company. He'd never have to work again.  I agree with the others on this thread that Ron is a fun person and very passionate about his fishing and life in general. If you ever get a chance to meet him, don't turn that chance down."
640450,Moosebunk,2011-11-16 01:37:00,3970,"I waved at Ron once.  He never waved back.  He's still A-OK in my books though, and I'd wave again."
640459,Ron,2011-11-16 02:21:00,1683,"Oh come on guys,  I'm sure you would all do the same if you saw the situation.  Hey thanks for all the kind words.  Mike P, ha ha ha, my daughter would think of it differently! ha ha ha Steph was still happy to see Jade fight that muskie like a champ!  Garnet, too funny brother! roflmao!!!  Tonka-Toy, had a great chinwag with ya. Look forward to the next time we happen to meet up.  Special thanks to OFC, if it wasn't for this place, I never would have met up with half of my fishing buddys.   Cheers, Ron..."
640512,Spiel,2011-11-16 12:28:00,9065," So in all the years you've been hanging around here you've only met one ""buddy."""
