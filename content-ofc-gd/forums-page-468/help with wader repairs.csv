There's a small patch on the heel that's worn through  Anyone ever have any luck patching this sort of thing up? Suspecting there's not much that can be done but thought I'd see if anyone has any ideas.  Thanks, Tim"

Just apply aqua seal right to the leaking area basically and it will seal it. Just did a job on a pair of neoprene Hodgemans in the exact area you mentioned. Turned the waders inside out,filled the boot full of water and watched closely for the water to come through. Found the hole, applied the aqua seal to the area and waited 8 to 12 hours..Leak fixed !!"

640371,timmeh,2011-11-15 21:54:00,609,Thanks guys. Wasn't sure if aquaseal worked well on neoprene but I'll give it a go.
