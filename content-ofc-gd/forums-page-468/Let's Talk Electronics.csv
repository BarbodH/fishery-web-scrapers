For the price and features I ""think"" this Humminbird 385ci Portable is the fishfinder I want. I just wanted to ask if anybody on here has used this unit or another similar to it. It's nice and small and I am use to the little screen already after playing around with it in the store. Are these portables easy to put into the boat once the ice fishing is over(taking out of case,mounting into boat..transducer and all), and is there a ""ice transducer"" i would need? I got that little 12' boat and could see myself in a 14 or bigger in the next season or two. http://store.humminbird.com/products/356811/385ci_Combo_Portable  Long story short, any reviews?? Also in terms of the GPS is all I need for the unit is a chip? I will be fishing the obvious Kawartha Lakes, as well as Quinte,Simcoe,and out in eastern Ontario fishing lot's of inland lakes close to Charleston Lake area.   Any thought's, should I go bigger and better and still get a portable unit?   Hope to spark some good feedback here.  Tightlines,  MTBF"

However, the ice transducer makes things so much easier..  http://store.humminbird.com/products/314001?product_id=56705ccd03fc815f9a883ebcb7c064a7  I've got a 788CI that I will be using this year in my portable pack (Used a 747C before that, worked great!)"
640421,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-16 00:05:00,3761,  Step 1 figured out lol. Thanks Bill
640427,kickingfrog,2011-11-16 00:17:00,8333,I have a similar hb portable unit and I leave it in the caring case when I use it in a boat. I just unplug it from the transducer and bring it onshore to recharge it and keep it out of site.
640433,scugpg,2011-11-16 00:37:00,1373,Check out the Lowrance Elite 5 Ice Machine. Would cover you any time of the year and its a great product.
640437,scugpg,2011-11-16 00:50:00,1373,Here's the link. http://www.lowrance.com/Products/Marine/IceMachine-Portable-Fishfinders/Elite-5-IceMachine/  I think that gives you the best unit for what you're after. Just add a transom transducer when its time to hit the open water.
640449,kickingfrog,2011-11-16 01:32:00,8333,Not going to argue that the ice machine is better but it is around $250 more.
640465,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-16 02:49:00,3761, Ya that's kinda a jump. What a package tho  Still chasing the little Humminbird.
640628,Tybo,2011-11-16 22:09:00,1373,"Bought one last year.Just used it ice fishing and it's a great little unit. The image is clear enough that I don't have to wear my glass to read it(far sighted) For being a coloured unit,I've yeaht to kill the battery in a single outing. Mounting it on the sled this year to take full advantage of the GPS"
