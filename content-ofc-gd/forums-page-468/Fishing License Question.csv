I didn't think it would make much sense to purchase a 2011 license and then have to purchase a 2012 license in a month's time.  Thanks."
640567,tonyb,2011-11-16 18:41:00,1637," No.  2011 for 2011, 2012 for 2012."
640568,kickingfrog,2011-11-16 18:50:00,8333,"Only if he already has a licence or buys one for this year. ""weekend"" licences can be obtained as well."
640570,FrankTheRabbit,2011-11-16 18:57:00,479,"Thanks for the info!  I suggested those one-day licenses if he were to just fish the one time only. He don't own any fishing gear at all, so it might be the better (and only) solution."
640571,GBW,2011-11-16 18:59:00,8460,"just make him be your camera man for your trips and make sure you just have the one fishing rod.  tell him it's for his own good, to learn.  oh and the one rod is if a CO comes by."
