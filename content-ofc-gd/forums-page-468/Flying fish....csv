640368,Spiel,2011-11-15 21:46:00,9065,I saw lots of them off of Margarita Island (Venezuela) when I fished there many years ago. Pretty cool adaptation for a fish!
640381,ChrisK,2011-11-15 22:16:00,2772,"I ordered Atlantic Char at a local restaurant recently and they placed a small bowl beside the Char full of ,you guessed it,flying fish eggs. I asked the waiter if he wanted me to tie up a bunch of roe bags with it I ended up eating all the eggs with my Atlantic Char. Was quite tasty...."

Cut the roll into bite size chunks and spread about 1/2 teaspoon of eggs on top of the cut side of the sushi piece.  My kids love to eat these.  Also, I would feed my guppies and neon tetras with any of the eggs left on the plates that are not licked away."
