The coyotes have done well picking up solid back-up goalies and turning them into legimate starters. Mike Smith looks like the real deal... Too bad the Leafs are goalie killers eh? haha.  Anybody else think that the Coyotes might end up being the next Canadian team? I'd love to see them in Hamilton. We should know  more about their ownership situation towards the end of this season.  Go Coyotes (The original Jets) Go!"

640444,Rod Caster,2011-11-16 01:10:00,5784,Smith is playing like a pro so far. 14 for 14. Scrivens is 8 for 10. Score is 2-0 coyotes Woo hoo!

640456,Rod Caster,2011-11-16 02:17:00,5784, I'm guessing you predicted a 2 point spread? brutal 2nd and 3rd period for the 'Yotes.  It's still anybody's game though. Lupul penalty!
