640168,ccmtcanada,2011-11-15 02:09:00,7971," That was my ""day"" Bill.  Hasn't happened since lol"
640575,torco,2011-11-16 19:06:00,656,It happens.  I am trying to get steelhead on the fly this fall and have not had any success yet. Yesterday was probably the most painful because I knew there were some nice fish in the area I was fishing and a good part of me wanted to go back to the car and get my spinning rod and float for them.  Just keep plugging away and trying different presentations.
