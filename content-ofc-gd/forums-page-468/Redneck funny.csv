All the Rednecks sitting around the bar look up, expecting to see some pitiful Yankee from the north.  The bartender says, ""You ain't from around here, are ya?""  The guy says, ""No, I'm from Canada .""  The bartender says, ""What do you do in Canada ?""  The guy says, ""I'm a taxidermist.""  The bartender says, ""A taxidermist?  What in tarnation is a taxidermist?  Do you drive a taxi?""  ""No"", says the Canadian ""A taxidermist doesn't drive a taxi. I mount animals.""  The bartender grins and hollers, ""It's okay boys. He's one of us."""
