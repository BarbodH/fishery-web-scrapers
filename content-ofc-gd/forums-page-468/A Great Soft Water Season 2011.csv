Last season i bought a small 14' aluminum with a Merc 8hp, and i hit the water running The fishing bug resurfaced in me, and i spent last summer fishing anything i could catch. At the end of last season, i knew that i would need a bigger,more powerful boat if i was going to fish all the places i wanted to. I had seen the boat i wanted, that July, and i was hoping that the dealer would still have it at the end of the year. So, Middle of January, back i went, and there she was A whole lot cheaper than she was in July Picked her up April 20th.    Now, i was brought up as a Bass fisher, so this year started off with a trip with my brother for Large Mouth Bass in a small lake outside of Ottawa.Opening day and we had our limits in 4 hours.      As the season progressed, i had fun with perch. Got into a mess of them and had some good eats.    Some nice Pike were the first slime my new boat had on her.      Found out that the stretch of river i fish here had some really nice Small Mouth Bass and walleye too.    Then on a fateful trip to Lake St Francis,........I busted my prop and skeg on the only rock pile in the lake   I say fateful trip, because a member of this community read my thread about busting my prop, and commented that he knew where i did it. I started to talk with him via PM, and the rest is history. Musky Mike has become a very good friend of mine.I expressed my desire to learn from him, and asked if he would help me catch my first Musky.My first and PB.Small by many standards, but 42"" first is fine by me.  Well after that day, he posted a thread with pics of some great walleye he had caught.He offered to take me out the next week. Not only did i catch some of the biggest walleye of my life that day, but also a PB 9lber      At this point, i decided that Walleye would be my target species.They are such a blast catching, and there are so many, that it makes for a great day on the water, fishing them. Mike is an excellent teacher and a top notch guide,so My brother and i hired him for a day of walleye fishing on the Franny.Along with some excellent Walters, my brother got a personal best smallmouth, and i caught my second a  third Muskies.Mike also took me Carp fishing for the first time.No pics, but i did catch a nice one.Can't wait to get out for them again in the spring.      I would just like to say a thanks to each and all of you here.You have taught me much. I hope to get out with some of you next year, so i can keep on learning.Also, hopefully next season i will be outfitted for cold weather fishing.  Tite Lines All  Paul"
