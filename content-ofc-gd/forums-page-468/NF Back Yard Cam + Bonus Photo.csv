The camera is 100yrds from the house, BUT unfortunately theres no hunting permitted, FIGURES! The last photo is my bonus. Thought I'll share some photos since I haven't posted in a while. Enjoy!              Sorry about the quality, rain on the lens.            Didn't expect this one.    This was a bonus photo from my ladder stand before the hunt.  "
640405,misfish,2011-11-15 23:21:00,29133,Nice cam shot Dan. Good to hear from you.
640524,Big Cliff,2011-11-16 13:19:00,6899,Those are some really nice shots. Can you not bow hunt in that area?
640528,fishindevil,2011-11-16 13:41:00,6254,awesome shots man !!!! lots of critters around your place for sure...!!!
640530,Roy,2011-11-16 13:48:00,13728,Is that a 3-legged deer in the third pic?
640531,oldphart,2011-11-16 14:32:00,665,"~~~great pics, thanks for sharing"
640533,NAW,2011-11-16 14:46:00,4022,"Nice pics man.  I'm going to have a ""back yard cam"" in a few weeks.  But I CAN hunt there"
640542,bucktail,2011-11-16 15:59:00,1857,"""Those are some really nice shots. Can you not bow hunt in that area? ""  That was what I was thinking as well.  I love game cam's , it's amazing what's running around at night that people don't know about!!  Thanks for the pics!"

640559,Lunkerhunter,2011-11-16 18:22:00,455, definetely looks like a 3 legged deer in the third pic. pretty interesting
640586,bassjnkie,2011-11-16 19:37:00,1101," Yes, unfortunately I only own a small portion of the woods and the owner of the rest won't allow us to hunt at all. But I'll bring him a case of beer and see if that changes his mind.   Roy I've been looking at that pic for a while now, magnified it and it looks like 3 legs. it was a weird pic for sure.   Sure rub it in.   Your totally right. I can hunt for cyotes in the field in front of the house but not the field 1000yrds beside it.   Interesting for sure and I can't wait to catch it again to see for sure."
640593,misfish,2011-11-16 20:20:00,29133,  Should be interesting to see whats back there Nick.
