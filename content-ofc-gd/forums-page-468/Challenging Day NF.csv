We were supposed to go fishing for rainbows tomorrow, but he called it off as he can no longer crank a reel. I think of the country song, ""To live like you were dying"", well, he is living it. Unfortunately he cannot ride a bull, or parachute, but he can be the husband he should have been, giving forgiveness and love. I do not know what I am trying to say currently, but maybe we should all look hard at how and what we live. I just cannot imagine what he is going through losing his body, but not his mind. Thanks for listening."

It has a footage of a soldier, husband, father, who can no longer hold his daughter. It makes me well up everytime I see it.  I wish him some inner-peace in dealing with this diagnosis."

Maybe take a collection up, from his friends and familly, and get him a motorized fishing reel(if he really loves fishing)They are quite expensive, but are a great aid to handicapped anglers.  Paul"
