640653,Bondy,2011-11-16 23:45:00,40,"Hey guys, as the season draws down I thought you guys would like to see two hawgs we took this year, one 2 days after opener and the other today. The first was 50X26 and todays was 56X23 1/2. Both fish come jigging deep in the Detroit River! "
640655,Bondy,2011-11-16 23:46:00,40,Here is the other!!! 
640656,Fang,2011-11-16 23:47:00,1330,That thing looks like it just ate a small dog
640661,danbouck,2011-11-16 23:51:00,4380,
640663,Live2fish85,2011-11-16 23:59:00,1633,Holy Crap those are some nice musky. I hope to get some like those in the future.
640666,mercman,2011-11-17 00:03:00,7054,I'd soil my knickers if i hooked into something that size
640667,Bondy,2011-11-17 00:07:00,40,He almost did. He might have soiled himself actually cause we went in 1 hour later..
640668,Dusky,2011-11-17 00:16:00,310,Musky god seems very happy with you
640670,Rizzo,2011-11-17 00:26:00,4754,"holy! are those dimensions right though? 23 seems a little ""skinny"" on the second fish. Then again, if you're 56 long maybe its just a long ""thin"" fish. Just seems disproportionate for this time of year...then again what the heck do I know about a 56 inch musky! 2 awesome specimens"
640673,mike rousseau,2011-11-17 00:33:00,4661,Man I gotta get on that jigging bite on the St.Lawrence...
