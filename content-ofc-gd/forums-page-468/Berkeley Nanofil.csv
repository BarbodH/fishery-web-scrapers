640730,GBW,2011-11-17 03:57:00,8460,"the knot and line landed me my PB musky from my folks lake so I think the 12LB is a decent line.  and no, I wasn't fishing for musky with it..."
640202,Eazy,2011-11-15 03:58:00,260,"Seen that berkeley has a new super-line/monofilament out, just wanted to see if any fellow anglers have tried it out yet, before dropping the cash on it?"
640206,Eazy,2011-11-15 04:04:00,260,"Super-lines for me are good for two things:  1.) Flat-lining: trolling with anything more han 50' behind the boat, and  2.) Ice-fishing using the berkeley micro-ice fireline."
640210,GoneFishin,2011-11-15 04:40:00,349,I've only tried it float fishing using a center pin reel. It cast like a dream but if it gets the chance it knots up like you wouldn't believe.. It might be nice for throwing light baits but you really need to manage your line properly.
640213,bare foot wader,2011-11-15 05:10:00,1354,I was impressed with it on the pin  GoneFishing - are you maybe sidecasting more than wallis?
640214,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 05:30:00,11391,"I don't really care for it on a spinning set up. I find it slippery and has poor knot strength. If the knot strength was better, I'd like it for vertical presentations."
640217,Eazy,2011-11-15 05:34:00,260,hmmm.......maybe stick with a good-quality mono.
640235,mercman,2011-11-15 11:54:00,7054,"I find it has way too much spool memory for my liking.Yes, it casts great, but i wont buy it again."
640238,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-15 12:19:00,3761, x2 But I was using it on a spinning reel...still had a bad few tangles.
640251,Live2fish85,2011-11-15 13:20:00,1633,"I don't care for the nanofil either. I bought a spool when it first came out and put it on my spinning reel. It was crap for drop shot as a main line and for casting it did cast nice and smooth but after casting for a few days I found it started to almost fray like braid, I don't know that it is actually fraying or just breakint down but I will stick to braid. I am going to try the new power pro slick though and see how that is. I just noticed fishing world is carrying it."
640377,BillM,2011-11-15 22:08:00,17367, Learn to tie the correct knot
640382,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 22:16:00,11391," lol, the ""nanofil knot"" is still poor IMO, at least in comparison to other lines. As soon as I'm in between seasons, I'll start practicing tying knots again   "
640396,BillM,2011-11-15 22:36:00,17367, I can't see how you have time to fish with all the knot comparisons you've been doing..  Interesting stuff.
640418,Garry2Rs,2011-11-16 00:04:00,1425,"I am not a Berkley, or Pure Fishing fan, but I bought Nanofil and I like it. It does cast like a rocket!  It is very slick and you do need to tie double knots most of the time. After using it with a small Mepps the line seemed to show a twist, but this hasn't caused any problems. When I first spooled up it seemed to have a natural curl that I suppose came from the factory spool. This relaxed with use and wasn't a problem. No disrespect intended, but I suspect that some folks who had problems with memory, curl, twist etc. might have put the line on backwards. Garry2R's"
640422,GBW,2011-11-16 00:05:00,8460,I have had no problems here with it.
640455,Eazy,2011-11-16 02:11:00,260,"After a while does the ""finish"" wear off, and then become highly visible and retain water like other braids and such?"
640468,BillM,2011-11-16 02:56:00,17367, It's not a braid.
640474,GBW,2011-11-16 03:14:00,8460,that (what BillM said) and it already starts out white...
640481,Eazy,2011-11-16 03:47:00,260,Highly visible in the water?
640497,greenfin,2011-11-16 05:16:00,7,"Tried the 12lb Nanofil on spinning reel.  Works as advertised, esp when new.  Used mainly with spinner, crank and buzz baits.  However, after 4-5 outings, line begins to fray badly.  Still prefers braids since I have a wider choice of suppliers (brands) and line strength."
640503,GoneFishin,2011-11-16 09:08:00,349," I thought the knot strength would be poor but that wasn't the case after using the proper knot.  I didn't have a problem with line twist, it just tangles very easy, but what can you expect from a line of such thin diameter.."
640543,manitoubass2,2011-11-16 15:59:00,11391," Part of the fun of fishing is getting to try new products, see how they work for your style of fishing. Lots of products have a plus/minus side. Ultimately it's up to the individual to decide what products they like and choose to use.  Through years of experience, you can compare products for certain applications according to YOUR experience. Then when someone asks a question about said product, they are obviously looking for opinions on that product. All I did was voice my opinion and try to help make an educated decision.  My experience, or yours for that matter is never wrong.  Part of a message board is to create new members, drive traffic and help educate people. It's also a place to go in your downtime to have a little fun, and shoot the *hit with fellow anglers. This is a great board, full of great anglers of all types, great personalities etc. I enjoy it here. I've read post by you and enjoyed them, and even learned some things.  Sorry if I rubbed you the wrong way, but that's your issue, not mine. I am who I am.  IMO, if your going to post towards me in a sarcastic manner, at least inject a little humor.  Back to the topic..."
640565,EC1,2011-11-16 18:38:00,930,"I still havent tried this stuff yet, and it was on sale a while back for like 14.99 or something like that. I actually am not sure I want to try it, I'm just going to tell myself not to buy anything for now because I have a spool of 10lb braid that will sit forever if I get the nanofil.   Apparently someone went off and tried this in a tank for underwater visibility. Don't know how biased this is because the nanofil does seem to be slightly further back."
640647,BillM,2011-11-16 23:16:00,17367," Years of experience has taught me how to tie a knot properly  I banked a few hot chromers today, no issues with knots.  Also casts like a dream.  More time on the water will see if it lives up to the hype, so far so good!"
640674,manitoubass2,2011-11-17 00:34:00,11391," I can tie a knot properly, maybe not macrame world champion status, but I can tie knots properly .  What knot are you using? The recommended knots, or some of the others that have been experimented with?  I'm not ruling this line out completely. I think It still might have some applications for me, time will tell.  And congrats on the chromers   "
640685,BillM,2011-11-17 01:18:00,17367,"It's just the Nanofil knot, although to me it makes more sense to call it an improved palomar."
