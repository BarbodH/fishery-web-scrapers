I got out just as much as last year , probably around 250 times. Fished alot of ""ol'faithful lakes"", some new ones, some I hadn't visited since childhood, and managed to hit the Rainy River 4-5 times per week.  Every year I refine my style of fishing, and what I need to be a successful angler. The tackle box transforms itself year in, year out. This year it didn't transform too much though. It was more rods/reels that got changed up this year.  One of my goals this year was to try and target larger pike in the river (which I wasn't even sure existed, lol). It was alot of fun, and my PB was caught and one upped at least 3 times this year. Fishing pike also helped my patience, and also develope new patterns for smallmouth! Always a bonus. My previous best was 40"", this year I caught from 40"" up to a 47"" bohemoth that was released from shore witout a pic (booooo)  Poor pic, but most times I was fishing pike I was solo (so pics with fish just werent possible)   I also took a kid out fishing for his first time and he got into a nice mid sized pike   The smallmouth fishing this year was sort of a letdown. Not as many big fish, but great numbers. I never found any smallies over 4lbs this year, and usually have numerous 5lb+. Oh well, it'll have to wait until next year, lol. I did alot of drop shotting this year and improved alot on that technique. I also grew as a crank bait angler as well. I spent alot of time digging cranks on bottom, smashing rocks, putting lures in the dirty stuff! Turned out to work very well, and you know what? I think I lost maybe 3-4 cranks all year, as opposed to 50 or so the previous year, lol.      The walleye bite was also a bit of a letdown this year. The water started at flood levels (at ice out), and delayed everything. The fish were still in great numbers, I just couldn't manage anything over 30"" for the first time in years. In fall, the extreme opposite happened, and the river was almost dry, again, screwing with the walleye. Still did great though, I'm not complaining.      This year my two oldest boys got some new species added to their belts, which is always great. Pumpkinseed, rockbass, crappie and lake trout were all added this year! Way to go my boys!  I also spent more time preparing for more tourny fishing for next year. Spent some time getting to know some other anglers etc, which was great experience.  And another fun time was getting to meet Limeyangler and fishing the long sault for a day. We missed a few big girls, but still did ok. Great boat company though and I wish we had more time  No amount of camera trickery can make this fish look big! lol, Simon on the other hand?      I can't wait for hardwater now! And next year too!  I hope you all had a great year as well! I was happy to witness some of the board members personal growth from their reports, great job guys/gals!!!"
640288,johnnyb,2011-11-15 16:29:00,3413,Well...I think I've seen ALL of those pics spread throughout your many reports....definitely been a good year for you man...nicely done!
640291,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 16:33:00,11391," Yeppers, lol. Another thing I did this year was take ALOT less pictures, so my fish porn stash is greatly reduced.  What were the fellow board members highlights/lowlights???  My lowlights were def. snapping a new rod and almost being eaten by a bear, lol   "
640294,mercman,2011-11-15 16:40:00,7054,Awesome !!! You got into some serious fish this season !!!! Looking forward to your winter reports  Paul  
640305,Jigger,2011-11-15 17:11:00,1237,"Youre sure doing well if you can get out on Rainy R. 4-5 times a week! Looks like a great year for you, a 47"" pike is a trophy by anyones standards. Congrats!"
640306,Rod Caster,2011-11-15 17:12:00,5784,a 47inch pike is a great catch!  Thanks for sharing
640311,manitoubass2,2011-11-15 17:29:00,11391,"Thanks guys! The most memorable thing about that pike wasn't it's size though, it was the way it hit the bait! I was fishing with another guy, and I put a 4"" Berkley ripple shad on a round jig. We were fishing the current seem in some deeper water with some success, but nothing bigger than 30"". I said to him "" I bet there is a big pike sunning itself on that shallow sand bar"". My bait seems to be cast directly in its mouth! The second it hit the water the fight was on! I'll never forget that, it was such an amazing feeling!  Another great memory was my oldest boys first bass on a crankbait, on the first cast! Man he was pumped!   So what are your most memorable moments of 2011??? I wanna hear them!  Thanks again guys"
640335,Rod Caster,2011-11-15 19:18:00,5784, One of my favorite moments of the year was the first time Dana and I went fishing this summer. We caught nearly nothing for 5-6 hours and then the evening came and we smashed over 40 walleye! It was his best day of fishing in his life and it was in my top 10. Real fun stuff watching someone break a record.
640428,spincast,2011-11-16 00:18:00,3279,great report - those northern waters are so productive.... drewling with jealousy. Congrats on the PBs.
640458,rocheleauc,2011-11-16 02:18:00,205,Awesome man thanks for sharing. Looks like it was a great year
