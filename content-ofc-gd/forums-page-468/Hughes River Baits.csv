294933,Raf,2009-01-20 05:52:00,3495,"they are good baits todd.  nice action on them and well built.. they should be for the price.  if you like throwing gliders, and dont mind spending the coin, you will like how they work.  there a less expensive alternatives that work too.  don't bounce one off a rock"
295034,tnt,2009-01-20 15:49:00,63,Thanks Raf.

295507,cram,2009-01-21 23:49:00,1733,Is the action of wood gliders that much better than plastic?   I liked plastic for better hook-ups (as well as price and durability) but have heard that wood is better....?

631692,Garry2Rs,2011-10-17 18:30:00,1425,"Wooden baits are generally hand made...No two pieces of wood are exactly the same, therefore, wooden baits have to be hand tuned...You have to pay for the time and skill that is required. There is also something quite special about using hand crafted items, the human touch?   A link to our pioneer past? I don't know... If you feel that hand tied fly's, and custom fishing rod are worth the extra cost, you already understand...If you don't, well, no explanation is really possible!"
