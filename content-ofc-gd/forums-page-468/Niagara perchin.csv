Have not taken too many pics.  Have enough trouble keeping the theiving dog from biting into every perch or diving in after the pike. Was a little cold out for the dog to go swimming. There have not been the numbers like up on Simcoe, but there certainly has been the quality.  "

641128,Ainsley,2011-11-18 16:23:00,142,I'm assuming you were on Erie. I've wanted to give perch a try out there but never got around to it. I had my boat in chippawa all summer but never got out to Erie.
