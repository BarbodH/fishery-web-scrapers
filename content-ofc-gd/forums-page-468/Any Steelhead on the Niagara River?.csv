640627,OntarioFlyGuy,2011-11-16 22:07:00,4,   We'll try it again but going solo next time.  Very impressed with the satellite image you attached. What website do you get the satellite images from?
640683,tonyb,2011-11-17 01:06:00,1637,  I believe the underlying data is from NASA Satellites  Enjoy!
640684,bobkayla,2011-11-17 01:10:00,148,"the niagara is truly a great fishery ,,,this time of year with the winds stirring up erie the fishing can be tough when the water is muddy..the trout shut down and don""t want to spend any energy,,you just hit it at bad time,,the guide you had probably knew this and did his best moving from spot to spot but he cannot predict the weather and fishing is fishing have never heard of any bad guides on the river,,,sure some better than others but i""m sure he gave an honest effort,,it is his liveleyhood and reputation..struckout the first three times i was there years ago when i started fishing the river but i know when you hit it right with the right presentation you will be amazed"
641007,ironstone74,2011-11-18 02:47:00,201,http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/  Lots of good info.  Surface temps too!
639766,OntarioFlyGuy,2011-11-13 19:26:00,4,"After seeing a fishing show about the great Steelhead fishing on the Niagara River my wife and I decided to pay for a guided trip there. Although our guide was friendly and seemed knowledable, unfortunately after fishing for 7 hrs we didn't hook a single Steelhead. Makes me think twice about hiring a guide in the future.  Just wondering if the fishing shows exaggerate the excellence of some of these 'hot spots' or maybe we're just unlucky?  Has anyone else fished the Niagara river for Steelhead and had any success?"
639768,Bill Shearer,2011-11-13 19:36:00,456,"60 guys crowding the whirlpool this morning can't all be wrong! Yes there are steelhead, browns, lake trout, as well as a multitude of other species in the Niagara. Not hooking up even once? It happens, but rarely."
639777,Remastered,2011-11-13 20:27:00,143,Must have been a crappy guide. Lots of success right now.
639784,OntarioFlyGuy,2011-11-13 21:06:00,4,  Thanks for the feedback. We were fishing from a boat which supposedly gives access to the more inaccessible hot spots in the river. Think that next time we'll just try shore fishing instead and save the guide fee.
639793,northernpike56,2011-11-13 21:53:00,717,time for a different guide
639808,Ainsley,2011-11-13 22:48:00,142,I've been down in the glen four times in the last week and have picked up at least one steelhead or brown every time.
639809,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-13 22:49:00,0,"Too bad:  I've known the Niagara to run hot and cold--though when the bite is on best make an appointment with the chiropractor!!  Truth be told, I like my own space with some fecund water. 60 guys around a pool sound like you will need a lubricant. I prefer to drive an extra hour or so and be within striking distance of three or four streams.  Best of luck!!"
639811,Rich Nelson,2011-11-13 22:51:00,332,"Your guide should have rescheduled or given u a refund, because the water conditions have been crap the last couple days (chocolate milk) Guess hes more cincerned about makin a buck than promoting busuness when he knew fishin would be very tough ( or impossible)"
639835,highdrifter,2011-11-13 23:50:00,2534, I agree.  The numbers should have been better from a boat.  I'd hold off until later in the year and when Erie has settled.  That's the update I was looking for though.  cheers!
639871,ironstone74,2011-11-14 01:29:00,201,"No Steelhead in the Niagara this Fall at all!  Ok, only one in there...  "
640172,hawk-eye,2011-11-15 02:27:00,141,"River is hot and cold. Ive been skunked in perfect conditions, and have done well in bad conditions. Curious to know what guide you hired down there. I know a few of the guys and am sure that they would have given you another trip out at no charge."
640177,Remastered,2011-11-15 02:32:00,143,Have you considered going with NiagaraFishingAdventures. I hear they really know their stuff.
640194,Ben_Daniels,2011-11-15 03:21:00,435,Ive heard great things about www.castadventures.ca and Paul Castello.
640195,OntarioFlyGuy,2011-11-15 03:22:00,4,  Thanks for the suggestion but I think we'll just go solo the next time.
640231,fishindevil,2011-11-15 11:17:00,6254,"check out cast adventures his name is paul !!! he is the man you want to guide you for sure !!! he knows every inch of that river,he will put you on fish everytime...."
640463,fishinguypat,2011-11-16 02:41:00,547,strange I always heard bottom bouncing from a  boat in Niagara was killer
640467,BillM,2011-11-16 02:56:00,17367,Hire a different guide next time.
640495,carll2,2011-11-16 04:51:00,443, amazing guide and even in hard conditions has managed to put us on some fish!!!
640501,thalweg,2011-11-16 07:13:00,112,Paul has an impeccable reputation for fishing the Niagara river and surrounding water bodies.  IF he can't get them...then highly unlikely anyone else can.
640519,fishin jesus,2011-11-16 12:57:00,53,Paul knows the fish by name in that river  ! check out his Face book page ( thats how I decided to use him ) and we produced all day long. somethings wrong if a guide doesn't get 1 hook up on that River in peak season ?????  
640537,tonyb,2011-11-16 15:34:00,1637,"The guide should have re-scheduled your trip if it was Mon or Tues this week when you went. With the high winds this past weekend, the Eastern basin of Lake Erie was churned up and muddy.  The result is a muddy Niagara River, and with poor visibility comes difficult fishing.  Here is an aerial view of the Eastern Basin and the muddy plume of water dumping into Lake Ontario (top right corner of photo).  The file is from November 12th, early on in that big wind storm.  It would have been significantly worse come Monday!    Best of luck in the future, don't give up on the River so easy though, it's truly world class! (when the conditions allow!)"
640539,Harrison,2011-11-16 15:48:00,2202,"Agreed Tony.  World class fishery for sure. I've fished the river alot and it is a hike for me, so I try to time the conditions right.  A buddy and I tried to meet up there for a fish for literally a year!  Everytime our schedules would allow us to get together, the conditions sucked.  Then he moved to BC, those of you who know Al Patton will know why I wanted to fish the river with him!  To the OP, there are some awesome guides on the river."
640551,T.Barry,2011-11-16 17:12:00,24,"  Fished with Al a few times on the river back before he moved.  Great guy, haven't talked to him in quite a while!"
640569,torco,2011-11-16 18:54:00,656,That sucks but I would say don't count out all guides based on this experience. A good guy not only helps catch fish but provides valuable teaching or should at least.  Hopefully you at least learned something on the trip.
640585,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-16 19:34:00,0,"No steelhead ""on"" the Niagara River, but I'm sure there are some ""in"" it. "
