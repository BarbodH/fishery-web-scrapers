641207,ah_long,2011-11-18 22:01:00,354,"great deal, best price I shopped so far in the States is $871.50 w/ free shipping to US address w/ no state tax  they pre-charge duties and taxes if shipped to Canada, I think it might be better to order and have it shipped to the States and pick it up, you should have a chance to get a discount on the taxes and duties"
