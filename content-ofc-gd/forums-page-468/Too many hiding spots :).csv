639942,Moosebunk,2011-11-14 05:28:00,3970,Ha!  Nice way to earn $210.  Just cleaning a couple drawers.  At least tuck half of it away again Lew and forget about it.  That way down the road you'll have another pleasant surprise.
639956,Big Cliff,2011-11-14 09:27:00,6899,Dang I never have any money left over to hide anywhere LOL. Glad you found it though Lew now you have to wonder how much more you might have hidden and don't remember?
639967,lew,2011-11-14 11:06:00,12766,"Well, no more loot found over the weekend, so I spose I'm gonna have to settle with what I've got.  Thanks for all the laughs folks   :lol:"
639968,Skipper D,2011-11-14 11:18:00,1970,How much do you think it'll cost Lew to put the house back together ......... lol  lol  lol .
639969,lew,2011-11-14 11:23:00,12766, Hopefully not more than $210
640092,wallyboss,2011-11-14 22:33:00,1095,"Not that it's going to happen here but,  after we had to admit my Dad to the hospital (alzheimers) my Mom got a phone call from my Dad's brother who owned a business, he asked my Mom to go and see him that they had to talk. Well it turns out that my Dad had given over $30,000.00 to my uncle so that he could put it in his safe at the store. My Dad was the money handler at home. So if my uncle hadn't said anything to my mom at that time my Mom would've not known anything about it. Cause my Uncle passed away just a few months after that.  My Dad had given that money to my Uncle 10 years before."
640242,pikehunter,2011-11-15 12:43:00,1659,"Did I hear you say that you need some help to clean up around the house?  Kinda nice getting old sometimes eh Lew, around every corner is a surprise!  That is a nice find, enjoy the money"
640522,bucktail,2011-11-16 12:59:00,1857,Can I come to your place for an Easter Egg hunt???
639285,lew,2011-11-11 12:30:00,12766,"I was rummaging through one of my drawers last night looking for something and when I moved some stuff in the back I came across a wad of cash that turned out to be $70. I asked my wife if she put it there and she said no, so I guess I stuck it there for whatever reason and forgot all about it.....bonus  I would never hide money on my wife and have no idea why it was there.  Anyways, I go back to my original search in some other drawers and darned if I don't find another wad of loot I squirelled away at some point, this time it's $140  Getting older & forgetful isn't always a good thing, but if this keeps up I may be a rich man someday   :lol:"
639287,Roy,2011-11-11 12:39:00,13728,"Lew, If I were you, I would have picked drawer number 3!  Y'know..maybe Diane did hide the $ in there to give you some incentive to clean all your drawers?  edited to add: I know how that works cause I used to drop a few bucks in the laundry for Suzanne from time to time."
639288,danbouck,2011-11-11 12:40:00,4380,I guarantee that would never happen in my house
639289,mercman,2011-11-11 12:42:00,7054," When my Grandfather passed away, my Mom and Grandmother found 160K hid in empty frozen OJ cans in the freezer.He refused to put his money in the bank. I remember always wondering why he had so much OJ. He would always say""Drink up Paul, it will PAY off in the future""  "
639291,woodenboater,2011-11-11 12:46:00,2277,"Lew,  Hope you didn't squirrel away any money above ceiling panels or under floorboards"
639293,lew,2011-11-11 13:02:00,12766,I think I'll spend the weekend tearing the house apart.  Who knows what else I've hidden around here ??
639298,vance,2011-11-11 13:22:00,719,Better write down what you are looking for in case you forget half way thru the search LOL  vance

639307,Harrison,2011-11-11 14:01:00,2202,"Lew, let me know if you ever need a hand moving."
639308,fishindevil,2011-11-11 14:02:00,6254,man and i thought i was doing good when i find 3 or 4 toonies under the seat of my truck !!!  well done lew !!!! i foresee a few new muskie baits in next few days !!!!
639309,Fish Farmer,2011-11-11 14:03:00,2234,"Gezz Lew, check your office ""boat"" could be some bonus cash for the next trip I just thought I'd better check the couch, found 1 quarter"
639317,bigbuck,2011-11-11 14:44:00,2449,"$210, that equals gas for the boat and a couple of bucktails. OR, do the smart thing and bury it in the backyard."
639347,manitoubass2,2011-11-11 16:23:00,11391," Your grandfather is an awesome man, major cool points on that story!   "
639353,lew,2011-11-11 17:07:00,12766," With Christmas fast approaching, I think my wife will have ideas of what to do with the new found loot.  Thanks boys, I'm glad everyone found a bit of humour in my senility"
639370,jpfishing,2011-11-11 18:33:00,53,Cash is key! It can be put towards some  stuff.
639381,Spiel,2011-11-11 19:26:00,9065,"   Edit: Cash is key! It can be put towards some (speaking senility). Sorry Lew, just seemed funny."
639384,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-11 19:36:00,2582,"BONUS LEW  :thumbsup_anim:   Found money is always a good thing...no matter the circumstance.  A co-worker of mine was helping his brother do renos at the house he had just bought.  They where in the process of tearing out a wall to make an ensuite bathroom. They found a secret cubby hole with $23,000 in it.  The brother found out latter from a neighbor that the old owner who had passed away.... used to play the ponies...so he figured that must have been his winnings he squirreled away and kept hidden from his wife"
639388,esoxansteel,2011-11-11 20:10:00,1307,"Lew you havnt got any Legend Plows stashed away somewhere do you?  preferably perch fire belly, or black perch?"
639398,fishnsled,2011-11-11 21:03:00,3520,"  I can lend a hand as well.....maybe just some house cleaning Lew?  Good find Lew, enjoy the shopping trip."
639422,Joey,2011-11-11 22:28:00,9122,"That is a real bonus Lew.  Reminds me of when my grandma passed away.  My mom, sister, aunt and I finally brought ourselves to clear out her room.   Not that we found alot of money, but some of the old, antique, really cool stuff we found squirreled away in drawers and hidden spots was just a treasure for us to find.  Especially my grandfather's (who predeceased her) war memorabilia and medals.  Leave a few treasures for your kids okay"
639423,misfish,2011-11-11 22:39:00,29133,"Hi ya Lew. I read this,this morning and couldnt wait to get home and start rummaging through my drawers. All I found was, my drawers.   Nice find,but Im sure it will come to you one morning when you wake up and say to yourself,I REMEMBER NOW. Dont laugh,I have done it."
639436,Rizzo,2011-11-11 23:26:00,4754,"That's awesome! Found money is great (although I guess it was your own all along). Nonetheless, because you didn't know about, may I suggest something totally frivolous and enjoyable. Maybe a nice night out for dinner at an expensive restaurant with the family.  Before my dad died he told us he had a ""confession"" to make. Immediately our hearts jumped...what had he done that he needed to confess about?? Ended up telling us that at the place in Florida he had hid some $$$$ for an emergency under the carpet in the closet! What do you know, after he was gone my mom and I head to Florida, pull up the carpet and there it was! Good thing he had time to ""confess"" or the next people to change the carpet would have had a nice surprise!"
639451,Whopper,2011-11-12 00:55:00,2174, At least you can find this funny Lew
639467,danc,2011-11-12 02:11:00,4677,I'm the opposite Lew. I know I've hidden money away and then I can never find it.
