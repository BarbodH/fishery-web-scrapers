Many follows one takers lost by Gary at boat on Saturday but no other takers, finally sunday morning when you only have an hour you catch straight away. Another nice solid fish for 2011. Thanks to everyone who has fished with me this year it has been awesome and sorry for the sore shoulders. The first year that I spent casting the majority of time with zero on the troll! "
