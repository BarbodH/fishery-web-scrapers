Went 10 for 11 and missed a ton of other hooksets, it was wild.  Fresh steel is amazing, every fish hooked went berserk.  Between me and 3 others fishing the same pool, there had to be 40+ fish landed in that time period.  I had 3 double headers with another gentleman fishing near me.  The bite died down around 1030 and I took off.  Anyone else do exceptionally well this morning?  Also got a chance to break in the new set up after getting skunked yesterday         "
640336,kemper,2011-11-15 19:18:00,2232,Good shootin!  Is it bad that I can identify the water from those shots? Its been producing well even through the recent drought there!
