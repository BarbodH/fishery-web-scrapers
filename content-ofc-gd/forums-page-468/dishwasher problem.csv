640831,mercman,2011-11-17 15:48:00,7054," Mike, of all people, you should know that i am in the parts bussiness.Or are ya getting independant on me."
640866,Tom McCutcheon,2011-11-17 18:19:00,627,Could be the impeller starting to break up.
640878,davey buoy,2011-11-17 19:04:00,5505,"If it isn't leaking water on the floor,your probably right.What about the door seals?"
640881,vance,2011-11-17 19:14:00,719,I know from experience that if you have a gas water heater the fill tube inside gets brittle and breaks off into very small plastic bits.Check the aerator on your kitchen taps to see if there are any in there and if so there's your problem.  vance
640884,mike rousseau,2011-11-17 19:25:00,4661,upon closer inspection its a rubber material...  but the door gasket looks fine
640888,esoxansteel,2011-11-17 19:37:00,1307,"mouse turds,  just kidding you should be out muskie fishing and not worrying about something like that, i mudded in a sky lite 2 years ago and its still not painted."
640891,NAW,2011-11-17 19:40:00,4022,"I'm no dishwasher repair man, but maybe there's something thats jammed in there, rubbing on a moving part.  Broken peace of something you may have put in the dishwasher maybe?  Or one of the likely several o-rings, or gaskets could be worn out.  How old the unit?"
640892,mike rousseau,2011-11-17 19:42:00,4661,  pretty old... it was hand-me-downed from the in laws...
640897,davey buoy,2011-11-17 19:51:00,5505,Just maybe time for a new one as I'm guessing 15 year old or abouts?
640898,mike rousseau,2011-11-17 19:59:00,4661,  sound about the right age
640903,mercman,2011-11-17 20:21:00,7054,"Mike, you know me, so i will take the liberty of saying this.If you change the machine because of this small problem, you have more money that brains It is a kenmore made by Whirlpool, and parts are inexpensive and still available, so FIX IT !!!!!"
640909,davey buoy,2011-11-17 20:53:00,5505,"Mike I don't know if that's something you want to takle. I'm a millwright and I don't know if I would tackle that unless it was something in the screen or something obvious. Also because of age, and pricing on new machines,energy efficient,I,m also thinking of replacing Mine.It's about 11years old and did well for me. Just my 2cnts worth.davey."
640922,mercman,2011-11-17 21:46:00,7054,"  Before you scrap an 11 year old machine, let me know what you need, and i will price it out for you. Probably even send you a parts breakdown so you can take it apart. 99% of all appliance repairs are inexpensive fixes.There is absolutely no new appliances on the market today that will outlast  the older models.ZERO. most breakdown right after warranty(1 year) and after 5 years, the parts are no longer available, even if the law states minimum 10years. Energy efficient means using undersized electrical parts, that work so hard to do the job, that they burn out within 12 months. I have seen new 22 cubic foot fridges with 1/5 hp compressors in them.Minimum size should be 1/4+ to 1/3 hp. All in an effort to save electricity.What they dont say is that the compressor has to work 5 times longer to achieve the proper temp. Even washing in cold water Hard on the washer parts, and since you are putting ice cold clothing in a dryer, it takes 3 times longer to dry.Where are you savinh money in electricity  Sorry for the Rant It just burns me to see people scrap perfectly good appliance over  tiny problems Trust me on this.I have 32 years experience in appliance parts, and have seen the evolution of appliances."
640926,davey buoy,2011-11-17 22:02:00,5505,"I may than reconsider,thanks merc."
640936,Big Cliff,2011-11-17 22:44:00,6899,"Believe me, Paul knows his stuff, he helped me fix my fridge and saved me hundreds of dollars. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be!"
640942,Billy Bob,2011-11-17 23:03:00,5865,TAKE PAUL'S ADVICE....HE CAN'T CATCH FISH ....BUT KNOW HIS APPLIANCES....sorry buddy I had to take the SHOT....  SERIOUSLY...listen to Mr. Paul.....   I just spent almost $500 rebuilding 2 - 30 year old Toro Snow Blowers because they are BUILT with real steel and no plastic....and they still blow like a porn star...
640950,ketchenany,2011-11-17 23:27:00,3229,  X2 on that one!
640954,bigbuck,2011-11-17 23:56:00,2449,"I fixed my whirlpool duet washer last year, I put a new pump in that cost me 125 and an hour and a half of my time. A new one is 1500. I can skin my knuckes for that kinda dough ray me."
640955,Big Cliff,2011-11-17 23:59:00,6899," For $500.00, what did you do, put two new engines on them? New bushings, belts, friction wheel, skid shoes, clean carbs, do a tune up. Should be $100.00 or so ea."
640960,mercman,2011-11-18 00:16:00,7054," Good point there Cliff. Bob has a reputation for being a bit of a ""THRIFTY"" man and self proclaimed tax dodger"
