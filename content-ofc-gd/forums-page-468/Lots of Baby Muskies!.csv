There are about 1800 healthy fingerlings (7-10 inches) ready to be stocked into Lake Simcoe in the next few weeks. Here are some pics, hope you enjoy.           The mascott fish!   A nice one about 9""   Placing a wire tag under the skin..."

640031,BillM,2011-11-14 18:01:00,17367,"Man, the smallmouth are going to get even bigger  :)"
640033,solopaddler,2011-11-14 18:15:00,8605,"Awesome stuff, great to see!"
640044,muskymatt,2011-11-14 19:24:00,2608,"Good stuff Dax, thanks for the update"
640046,Fang,2011-11-14 19:48:00,1330,Oh so neat. That aquarium shot just hit me with deja vu.  I had one about 1/3 that size in my fish tank many many years ago. I found it in a batch of minnows I bought at the old Dixie Sports and brought it home with me after a days fishing.  It sure was the coolest fish I ever had next to peacock bass. A little flighty in the tank but after I filled in some of the tank with more wood and fake plants it was right at home. Fed it feeder guppies and trout worms.
640095,Twocoda,2011-11-14 22:35:00,4130,i think ill buy a magnet and try my luck when they release them..
640104,spinnerbaitking,2011-11-14 23:28:00,1622,"That is very cool, here's hoping it works Thanx & Tight Lines SBK:Gonefishing:"
640105,spincast,2011-11-14 23:29:00,3279,very cool - the shot next plant is great.
640111,davey buoy,2011-11-14 23:41:00,5505,"Great job,but at that size how do you give them a fighting chance with the smallmouth and pike?. Hope it works!"
640116,camillj,2011-11-14 23:51:00,1988,"Jeeze I'll be over 80 by the time they are ready for the (50""+ club) BBQ"
640385,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-15 22:19:00,0,Hey Dax:  Nice photo-reportage--thanks for posting. Cool stuff.
640388,davey buoy,2011-11-15 22:23:00,5505,"Maybe they could at least keep them until they are big and strong enough to fend for themselves,I don't know if that's possible,but they seem quite small to take on the world/lake."
640394,Pigeontroller,2011-11-15 22:35:00,2793," Well, they're much larger than they would be if they were wild born...Apparently thats the best size for them to 'imprint', meaning return and spawn, when they are stocked at yearling size (10-12"") they are much less likely to spawn. The idea here is to restore the native Muskellunge."
