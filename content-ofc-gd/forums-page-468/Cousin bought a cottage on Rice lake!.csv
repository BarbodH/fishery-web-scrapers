I want to buy him some lures specially useful on rice for xmas, can anyone recommend some lures that are popular on the lake?  I know there are muskie on rice but he will most likely being trying for bass and walleye.  Thanks All"
640594,misfish,2011-11-16 20:22:00,29133,Anything bass related.  
640600,Harrison,2011-11-16 20:40:00,2202,"No Brainers for a Novice angler on Rice:  All easy to fish and mostly weedless.  Key for the novice.  Spinnerbaits. Topwater baits (frogs/poppers/buzz baits) 3 or 4inch twister tails tube jigs Bucktail jigs #7 Shap rap and/or  HJ12 Husky jerk weedless senkos  Your bass and walleye ready on Rice.  You can add a wack of stuff to that list, but is it a good start and covers all the water columns IMO.  Good luck, Phil"

640643,northernpike56,2011-11-16 22:57:00,717,jigs and husky jerks

640660,bassman87,2011-11-16 23:49:00,586,"oooohhhh for a xmas gift, i thought you meant hes heading out to fish on xmas. my bad"
640664,BillM,2011-11-16 23:59:00,17367," Leech is a good bet, but you can't beat a nightcrawler"
640671,Rizzo,2011-11-17 00:30:00,4754,"algae scooper...the only time I was at Rice that lake was greener than pea soup, couldn't see 2 inches! That was years ago, and I'm sure only a short term problem (ie I just got there on the wrong day). Congrats to your cousin (and good for you as well!)"
640681,esoxansteel,2011-11-17 01:00:00,1307,"A Trent Severn chart of Rice lake also would be a must, all those baits are great choices, but a lake chart will help to shorten the learning curve, and he will have 3 to 4 months to study it before the ice turns to water, also ice fishing for panfish is open, and he can mark productive spots on the map in pencil of course, as hot spot do change."

640715,Muskieman,2011-11-17 03:02:00,2472,"think outside the box; get it for the camp not the relatives  buy some wild rice it's a long grain...give them various paint jobs with nail polish, Super Glue some hooks and a lip on 'em?  Give it to them like a ""Ship in a Bottle"" or a ""Box Frame"".........  That way you can be guaranteed that it will find a place on the mantle and never end up stuck on a stump or lost to a Smallie...  It's just an idea.... something I would do.  Randy "
640765,smally21,2011-11-17 12:51:00,993,"all great lure ideas - the idea of the chart was a great gift idea. a few friends have fullsize govt charts framed on the wall of their cottage. people will always ask where when you  tell a story and we find ourselves in front of the chart everytime im there..,."
640778,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-17 13:29:00,2582, Excellent idea.
