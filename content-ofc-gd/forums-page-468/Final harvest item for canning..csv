In the summer they look like this.   Wee little elderberries that I pick by the bushel. The last pick is set aside for myself, and it was a more abundant pick this year. Tonight they became one of my favourites.. Brandy   I still have salsa to bottle, but the brandy marks the end of the harvest season."

641078,Roy,2011-11-18 14:21:00,13728,What did you do to get the brandy? Did you vaporize the alcohol from the elderberry wine? I'm just curious cause I didn't know it got that dark. Sounds like you're right into it.

641126,tb4me,2011-11-18 16:21:00,3295,"How did you make it, if you dont mind me asking? I thought you had to distill wine to get brandy? Looks awesome either way thou....."
