641041,Pigeontroller,2011-11-18 05:05:00,2793,Does anyone know if there is any public launches on the West side of Balsam Lake?
641042,cram,2011-11-18 05:22:00,1733,Should be one at the provincial park.  No idea if open though...
641069,Crazy Ivan,2011-11-18 13:54:00,184,The park launch closes around mid October.
641072,bigugli,2011-11-18 14:03:00,6138,Balsam lake trailer park and marina on Highgate Rd just off the 48  Public launch at Mitchell Lake then take the canal into the west end of Balsam.
641080,Tom McCutcheon,2011-11-18 14:25:00,627,"Dax, go to the KTD Google map. Highlite number 10, Laidlaw Point. That is the ramp on Balsam Lake Rd."
641100,Rizzo,2011-11-18 15:01:00,4754,"From the south if you're heading up 48, turn right on Balsam Lake drive. follow it a couple of kms. When the road veers to the left, you keep going straight. Not the greatest launch but I've definitely used worse! You will see the launch no problem from Balsam Lake drive. You will be right where the canal comes in from Mitchell"
641124,Pigeontroller,2011-11-18 16:19:00,2793,"Thanks Rizzo and Tom, thats the one I want!"
641127,Cosmos,2011-11-18 16:23:00,588,  You can't use canal any more - there is some kind of bridge in the middle of it. I was hoping to get to Balsam this way and had to get back Mitchell and move to different ramp on Balsam itself.
