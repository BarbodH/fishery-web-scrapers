219578,Clampet,2008-06-25 19:36:00,1947, I'm guesstimating $356.25 for gas.
219652,JohnF,2008-06-25 23:29:00,3494, Friend of mine gets his from the retired sheriff. It's pretty good stuff too.  JF
219654,JohnF,2008-06-25 23:32:00,3494," Just to put that in perspective, an acquaintance of mine says he'll burn almost $300 in fuel for one day of prefishing a tournament, and close to $150/ day during the tourney. Of course, his boat IS pretty fast.  Anyone wanna sign up for a bass tournament?  JF"
219657,danc,2008-06-25 23:43:00,4677, I'll guess double that amount.
219665,Nanook,2008-06-26 00:00:00,565," I know egzakly how you feel Glen. I did a 9 and a 14 getting home from P.E.I. and was totally wiped out. Glad you got home safe and sound [and got Art home as well, and Joe and Pops ]"
