218675,PatrickGG,2008-06-23 23:49:00,562,  I am so excited about opener this weekend and i can't wait for some posts and pics but i am just curious to see where are all the bass crazy people are going to be this weekend????
218677,JohnF,2008-06-23 23:52:00,3494,"I was checking out some of the local bass spots, and the news ain't grand. That rain we've been getting has turned the rivers to Krimko (does anyone else remember the chocolate milk by that name) and the forecast is for more of the same. What are the chances the little fishies are gonna be able to see the tempting treats we toss their way? We may be in for some braille fishing on Saturday.  JF"
218678,workwear,2008-06-23 23:53:00,592,csfl tourney............simcoe!!!!!!!!!    cant wait!!!!!
218729,tdotfisherman,2008-06-24 00:45:00,317,"I'm going to be working all of opening weekend so no chance to get out for some bass, but the following weekend going to hit up Georgian Bay for a mixed bag of smallies and largies.. should be fun!"
218736,MuddyWater,2008-06-24 00:54:00,218,im heading northeast around plevna way for some giant smallies. i dont like largies smallies are supreme!!!!
218740,cpguy29,2008-06-24 00:58:00,148,Will be on Scugog again. Can't wait!
218741,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-24 01:01:00,3761,I am going to try the shores on Lake Scugog and give my topwater snakes a try.
218759,jjcanoe,2008-06-24 01:17:00,744,"Pond X  On Saturday and undecided on Sunday, Maybe long point or maybe Crystal Beach for the CTTS event.  jjcanoe"
218761,oncogene,2008-06-24 01:19:00,154,I'm just hoping it won't be pouring rain and shooting lightning on Saturday. As long as the weather is good.... anywhere that has water looks good
218763,BillM,2008-06-24 01:20:00,17367,Was thinking possibly the Moon River Basin for some smallies and the chance at a monster ski  Most likely will end up on Little Lake or Gloucester.
218815,Rich,2008-06-24 02:09:00,3927,Long Point Bay for the annual derby. Never miss it!
218866,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-24 03:41:00,4399,  Yep I will be on the Bog as well and I will be on holidays next week so I hope to hit it hard.
218869,duber,2008-06-24 04:18:00,220,The Bay of Quinte for some buckets!!!
218878,jediangler,2008-06-24 05:17:00,1923,"Grand river close to home here, but probably not until Sunday."
218886,cpguy29,2008-06-24 08:48:00,148," Yes, I will also be on holidays and hittin her hard, perhaps I will see you out there."
218891,brifishrgy,2008-06-24 09:46:00,559,Erie for some monster smallies ( I hope) .. forecast doesnt look good
218892,Alumacraft,2008-06-24 09:59:00,139,"I was hoping to hit Erie for a day of topwater fishing but the forecast is for 40k winds from the south west, so I grabbed some O/T at work instead. I'll find some calm conditions thru the week and go."
218994,lookinforwalleye,2008-06-24 15:57:00,4399,  I will be in my black/siver Alumacraft!
219237,mike hagan,2008-06-25 01:24:00,50,"Will be fishing in the Bancroft area . And with any luck I will be breaking down a couple of beaver damns to some nice back lakes . Just hopping they didn't build them to big ,portaging the aluminum really sucks."
219241,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-25 01:28:00,2585,i will be on the south bay of lake nipissing sat-monday.  can't wait!  Cheers!

219352,Bassman Magazine,2008-06-25 09:50:00,1,I will be up east of Peterborough on a small lake. Looks like very hot and unstable weather with possible thunderstorms. Any thoughts on where the fish might be in these conditions?  
219355,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-25 10:51:00,2585, My guess is they will be hitting hard before the storms but most likely it will be a battle to get them to bite after.  I will be on nipissing and its suppose to just rain for 4 days straight so not sure what to expect up there.  Cheers!
219368,cranks bait,2008-06-25 11:22:00,721,"I too will be up near Bancroft for four days of fishin'.  I do not care if it is raining, I'll be out all day.  Saturday cannot come soon enough.  If you are in this area you will see me, come on over and say hi. "
219493,brooks999,2008-06-25 17:27:00,38,Lake/Pond it is about 40 - 50 acres on the back side of our property.   South   North    I feel like a kid waiting for X-Mas
