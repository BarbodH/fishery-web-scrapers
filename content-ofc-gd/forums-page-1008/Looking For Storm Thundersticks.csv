219052,solopaddler,2008-06-24 18:26:00,8605,"I'm usually pretty good at finding what I need online, but this has me stumped. Unfortunately you can't buy direct from Storm... I sure didn't think it'd be tough, but anyhow what I'm looking for are the newer Storm Thundersticks with the glued in plastic lip similar to the Rapala.  NOT the original Thundersticks with the molded plastic lip, they're easy to find:  http://www.stormlures.com/products/luresde...type=hard_lures  These are the ones I'm looking for:  http://www.stormlures.com/products/luresde...type=hard_lures  For whatever reason the 31/2"" version in the perch finish has been pure magic for me the last couple of seasons and I'm currently down to my last one  .  Caught a couple weeks back. Note the lure hanging from it's mouth  :    I'll buy anyone a beer if they can track these things down for me."
219067,Hooked,2008-06-24 18:57:00,891,"I'm going to be checking out my local tackle store in the next few days, I'll see if they got em."
219075,Stoty,2008-06-24 19:32:00,2910,Try ebay...  Thundersticks  Are you looking for the perch pattern or the firetiger pattern? I believe thats the firetiger pattern in the picture.
219094,MuddyWater,2008-06-24 20:05:00,218,big smallies LOVE thundersticks im running low myself  i use to get them from cabelas dont know if they still have em... just the molded i can find oh well...
219117,Basskicker,2008-06-24 20:45:00,421,"Hey Mike, try here  Unfortunately there is no picture, but I think it's what your looking for.  https://www.securewebexchange.com/baitcaste...products_id=148  Jason"
219132,solopaddler,2008-06-24 21:18:00,8605," Jason I think I might owe you a beer  No picture, but it is the right model number so I have to believe it's the right one. Expensive though, yikes! Unless I find a cheaper alternative Stateside I'll buy these ones though.  Thanks buddy!"
219146,gone_fishin,2008-06-24 22:17:00,481,check this one out... they have thundersticks... lots of other brands on here too... cheaper too!  http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/catpage-HBRIP.html
219155,solopaddler,2008-06-24 22:43:00,8605," Not the right Thundersticks, but thanks for trying to help.  Should have said it already, but thanks everyone else as well!"
219196,Basskicker,2008-06-25 00:14:00,421,"Hey Mike, I've been looking for a while now....and I can't find any in the states...wierd!!!  But here's another one ...in JAPAN...good luck bud....I say grab the ones in Canada before I do....  http://cgi.ebay.com/STORM-Thunder-Stick-TS...p3286.m20.l1116  Jason"
219203,solopaddler,2008-06-25 00:24:00,8605," It is weird isn't it?  That ebay link has some pretty good pic's of the lure, it's most definitely the right one. Even more expensive though eh? Wow!  Not sure how many of the lures that place near Ottawa has in stock, but I broke down and placed a healthy order a little while ago  . Seriously, that lure catches walleye for me when nothing else will!  (btw, check your pm's)"
219214,Guest gbfisher,2008-06-25 00:48:00,0,Why not try another lure in firetiger. Lots out there very close to that bait. Storm used to make some nice baits that they stopped making for one reason or another. Figures they are always the one you are looking for. Ebay has helped me. I have a whole box of them now....  Wont say which one.....lol.
219321,BabyHerc,2008-06-25 04:28:00,285,"Whoa call the crazy house, this guys likes the new thundersticks over the old ones??!?!    Just teasing.  I know Bass Pro had them when I worked there last year.  Don't know if they still stock them."
219410,johnnyb,2008-06-25 13:42:00,3413,"Are you close to a border?  When I plugged in my old Rochester zip code, they were at every WalMart, Dick's Sporting Goods and Gander Mountain in the area....   ???"
219461,JohnF,2008-06-25 16:41:00,3494,I just checked in the Fishing Store here in Stratford. He's only got 2 Walleye pattern. He's going down to Jos's in Woodstock right now and will check there.  JF
219553,solopaddler,2008-06-25 18:45:00,8605,  Thanks John!
219555,solopaddler,2008-06-25 18:50:00,8605," They only carry the original Thundersticks, the one with the molded lip, not the one I'm looking for.  On a side note I just received an email from the place near Ottawa. It seems they can't fill my order. The lures I want (TS09's) appear to be discontinued. I knew it was too good to be true  ARRRRGH!!"
219576,Basskicker,2008-06-25 19:27:00,421,Do I still get my beer? I did find one in JAPAN  Jason
219622,BabyHerc,2008-06-25 21:13:00,285,"Try the Smithwick Walleye Rogue as an alternative.  Great bright walleye colours, 3.5 inches long, and great trolling capabilities."
219636,solopaddler,2008-06-25 22:22:00,8605, LOL! Yeah you get your beer. Out of desperation I bought 2 from your Japanese link. Also managed to find a couple from some outfit in Mexico
219749,Cudz,2008-06-26 03:46:00,2652,"there is a guy in barrie that has a couple, just not sure if they are the right size or style but he alsways sell for cheap and I don't pay shipping because I live in Barrie. http://cgi.ebay.ca/STORM-MUSKY-SHALLOW-THU...1742.m153.l1262  and  http://cgi.ebay.ca/STORM-MUSKY-SHALLOW-THU...1742.m153.l1262  probably the wrong ones though I guess"
219860,JohnF,2008-06-26 15:27:00,3494,"My local store guy checked and found none. He's pretty certain he or Jos can bring them in from the States, but there might be extra duty and shipping involved.  JF"
219929,solopaddler,2008-06-26 18:01:00,8605," Thanks for going out of your way for me John, I appreciate it!  I'll give Jos a call myself, but I won't be holding my breath that he can order what I need. I've checked dozens of sources in the States including Storm lures and they just don't exist anymore. Worth a shot though....  Cheers"
