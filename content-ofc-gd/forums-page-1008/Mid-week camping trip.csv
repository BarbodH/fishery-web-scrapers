218335,Jer,2008-06-23 11:45:00,1426,"Hi everybody,  My girlfriend, her son (15) and I are hoping to do a 3-day, 2-night camping trip in mid-July, Tues-Thurs or Wed-Fri or something like that.  I'd like to find a place within 2-3 hours of Peterborough on a smaller, less-busy lake with docking for my boat. A smaller park (something like Lakair, but closer, would be perfect). I camped in a lot of Provincial Parks as a kid and don't really want anything where driving to the dock is necessary. I also grew up in the burbs of Mississauga, and alot of PP campgrounds have the same kinda feeling.  Sandra would be up for a boat-in site, but I'm not sure if we have the equipment necessary for remote camping, nor be able to take all our stuff in one trip (1 or 2 miles from the launch might not be so bad). The thought of my boat beached on some rocks, banging around all night really doesn't appeal to me either. But the remoteness is certainly appealing. What happens when you get out on a lake with crown land camping and all the spots are taken? I would also need some sort of a decent ramp for my 16 foot Crestliner.  Any recommendations or experiences are welcome. PM if you don't want to give away all your favourite spots to all that lurk.  Thanks."

218348,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-23 12:49:00,1362,"This might be what you're looking for....Crotch Lake campsites are listed in the link...the island campsites are great and you can book/reserve, on-line....Crotch has everything from Walleye, Bass, Pike, Perch, etc....  Mair is a nice lake as well...no problem with launching the boat...it is back in the bush and the campsites are boat to only...Rainbow trout and Lakers....  Govan is the furthest into the bush....again, boat to campsites only...Walleye, Pike, Bass...  http://www.northfrontenacparklands.com/ind...8&Itemid=44"
218620,Jer,2008-06-23 22:26:00,1426,"Thanks for the link, that place looks awesome.  I've got a few questions...I'll send you a PM.  Thanks again."
218629,Musky or Specks,2008-06-23 22:36:00,2710,"Mid summer, mid week. I think I 'd take site #215 in Port Rawson Bay in Massassauga PP. Boat to only but theres a nice sandy pull up. Great bass and pike fishing right in the bay. Also musky fishing if thats your desire. Great swimming right at the campsite and being midweek you will not have to deal with the big boats."
219133,Beans,2008-06-24 21:28:00,3339,I know it's nice to get away but you could pitch a tent in your backyard and be on some of the best waters the Tri lakes has to offer...  Just pretend you are somewhere else...
219261,Cast-Away,2008-06-25 02:02:00,790,"Jer, I agree with M&S with the Massasauga. It is all boat access and has some great sites! The only down side for the ladies is the thunderbox toilets!  Send me a PM if you want more info. I have been going there since 1990."
