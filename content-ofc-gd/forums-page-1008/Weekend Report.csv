This weekend had some interesting challenges:  Teach an absolute newbie, my friend who's never held a rod in his life, the pleasures of our pastime; battle the changing weather fronts; test out some of Ryan Landry's black lures; and get some inches for team 9.  Introducing the newest predator on the water  As you can see, I set him up with my 7foot MH paired with a Shimano Sedona 5000RB, 20# PP in moss green, leader for those pesky Northerns and a bright orange Cyclops so he can practice casting and see the action of the lure.  I told him he was gonna be casting from Saturday to Sunday non-stop, so he took to it whole heartedly.  As you can see the weather held up for us.  Within the first 15minutes he gets his first fish ever:clapping: It was dinky OOS smallmouth, a pound and a half at best.  No pic, sorry guys, it started bleeding and was released right away to grow up.  I got 5 pike and and OOS largie that afternoon before we got pushed off the water by an electrical storm.  This snot rocket got mauled by something bigger (NUDITY)  The release  That something bigger was, I beleive,  the nice 40inch Tiger musky I hooked two casts later on an orange 1/2oz spinner.  Fought it for about 40 seconds when it bulldoged underneath the boat, turned and got off    Sorry team, no inches this trip.  Would've been my first 'ski this season, but even more so, I would've loved to get her in for a pic.  I can tell you she was a Beaut, that tiger pattern is something else.  I tested out some of Ryan Landry's black lures.  Perhaps it's was because there was a leader tied on, or not, I found the action of these lures to be  Anyhow, free lures, I can't complain.  Out of what I could try, on a shallow very weedy lake, I liked the topwater popper at night  Although they didn't catch any fish, I'll give them another test run when I get to a more suitable lake.  The strom passed late evening so we went out for a night fish.  After a couple hours topwatering, jiging with white twistertails and tosing jointed rapalas, with no results we headed back in to get up bright and early for Sunday.  Sunday started off at 10am, it was bright out. lol.  My buddy, casting a white spinnerbait, yells  ""fish on"".  Two jumps and a WICKED fight got this respectable OOS LMB in the boat.   Went back to that tiger ski's address and knocked on her door a bunch of time with different baits, to no avail.  I left her my card and call back info.  That day was a tough fish, on and off rain.  But we couldn't leave before buddy hooked into a Northern.  Just before packing it in around 3pm he gets this hammerhandle   Hope you all enjoyed the report and fish porn.  Next time out I'll get our team some inches.  reefrunner"

219591,Reef Runner,2008-06-25 20:05:00,981,"Yeah he was ""hooked""!  Following Monday around 2pm he sends me a text ""I'd rather be fishing"".  Told me the past two days were a right off since all he was doin was day dreaming of getting out again.  My reply?  ""WELCOME TO MY WORLD"""
219595,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-25 20:11:00,0,Great report. Black is a very effective color. Especially for top water at night. I would definitely give them another chance! Good luck and thanks for sharing.
