219210,Mike the Pike,2008-06-25 00:42:00,3421,"Went to a Lake called Memphre Magog in the Easter Townships of Quebec.It is a Holiday here in Quebec while others had to work  We fished right in front of the popular ski resort Owls head.  Went with good friends Mike and GlennK.  Mike had invited us to try for some Lake Trout ,Atlantic Salmon and Rainbows.  Conditions were tough we tried jigging with dead smelt and trolling spoons I used lead core while Mike and Glennk used dipsie divers.It has been cold lately and we knew that thunderstorms would be possible.  After five hours of dissapointment we move into an Island and caught some bass ,perch and rock Bass.  Now one guy got skunked a newly more active member of our community but I won't mention any names  Anyhoo here some pics   Mike and GlennK   All the way out in the middle of the lake and this begger shows up yes he was snacking well.       Only decent fish caught today.     We had to call it a Day around 2:30 as the thunder was getting louder and the skies were getting Darker. Better to be safe unfortunately when we got the boat on the trailer it seemed to have cleared up.   Not a bad day wish we could have stayed for the evening bite but as much as I would like to have my grey hair change colour being fried by lighting was not what I wanted to test out.  Can't wait to get out again.  Had a great day with GlennK and Mike.Hope to do it again guys.   People who have not been fishing in awhile this is what happens on the way home.  Looking forward to Quinte in 3 weeks,  Hey Glenn I know you miss my old boat  MTP"

219530,wgk36,2008-06-25 18:09:00,69,"Nice report Mike. I had much better stats in the old boat. I guess I have a lot of room for improvement.  and remeber, a skunk in the boat is still better than a day in the office."
