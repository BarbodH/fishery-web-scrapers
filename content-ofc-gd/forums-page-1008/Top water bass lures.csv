219562,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-25 19:14:00,2585,"top water sure is fun, personally i rather fish topwater at night where your forced to set the hook by weight rather then site.  it is super exciting to see a bass hammer a topwater lure during the day though.  as for speed of retrieve?  it varies each day i find.  you have to adjust to the fish.  cheers!"
219571,oncogene,2008-06-25 19:21:00,154,I bought a topwater last year but still wasn't able to catch a single fish with it  I only shore fishing... so perhaps there simply wasn't any fish to be had on some days. But there were a few days when there were fish jumping (feeding on something top water I'd guess) everywhere in front where I could see.... yet I took out the topwater and still not getting a bite.... kinda made me feel like an idiot lol.
219600,addict,2008-06-25 20:17:00,475,"topwater bassin at night rules have had great success on buzzbaits,optimum makes a bait called the furbit also deadly,zara spook,and good ol gitter bug are great lures as well."
219606,bullybass,2008-06-25 20:26:00,144,"My favourite right now is to put on a 5"" grub in black with red flake and zip it along the top of the lilypads for buckets... just gotta get that patience down to feel the fish first.... nothing better than a topwater bass hit!!! I will also say chug bugs have worked excellent for me in the past.... I like the old perch pattern.... doesn't work as good since they changed it some years ago."
219607,cram,2008-06-25 20:30:00,1733,"Early morning and evening are best.  Some have caught during the day on topwaters, but for hte most part I'm sure everyone would agree that first and last 2 hrs of the day are best.  Also when there's a change in environmnetal conditions (ie. before a storm).  ANd for those who haven't caught fish on topwaters -- would bet they fished during the day.  As for lures -- the rapala is great.  Zara Spooks are  by far my favourite.  Fewer fish, but bigger (not sure why) and harder hits.  Also the small jitterbugs skittered across the surface (not just the pop-pop-pop jitter)."
219624,duber,2008-06-25 21:15:00,220,I like the Spro frogs (cast a mile) for heavy cover and a spook or jitterbug for more open spots.  Topwater is the most fun you can have on the water!  Topwater bass is cool but topwater muskie is heart stopping!!!!
219627,bullybass,2008-06-25 21:34:00,144,it is true topwater musky is fun but they have the worst topwater aim... we got a lot of them trying to hit our chug bugs on Scugog a couple years back... man I need my own boat!!!
219635,Burning Babies,2008-06-25 22:20:00,150,"Rapala minnows twitched on the surface have caught more than their share of big bass for me. Large rubber frogs are also a great big bass bait, and will produce better during the day than most other topwaters. Buzzbaits cover water quickly and have probably been my most consistent producers. Zara spook juniors have produced well for me at times, as have tiny torpedos and a variety of poppers.  I find good topwater bites tend to be sporadic.  Some days just aren't topwater days.  Other days, you don't even need to move them before a bass takes them out.  Don't write these baits off if you don't have success on them right away."
219637,Alumacraft,2008-06-25 22:27:00,139,"I fish topwater baits all day long doesn't matter if it's cloudy or sunny I'm addicted to them.I like Spooks,Jimmy's,Sammy's, Boyhowdy's,Dying Flutters, Devilshorse,Moss Boss's and Buzzbaits. I have some popper stlye baits but I don't seem to do as well on those. Colours don't matter as long as it has a white belly. I like to throw them on a baitcasting setup med/heavy rod and 20lb power pro. I'm hoping for light winds on Erie sat. for the opener. Last years opener was great no winds topwater bite was on all day I think I landed 60 smallies and can not guess at how many blowups I had. They are the most fun way to fish. Good luck to all fishing the opener."
219670,Mattones,2008-06-26 00:27:00,587,"Hm, Interesting thread. I should buy myself one or so of these."
219678,singingdog,2008-06-26 00:39:00,1047,"Topwater is just like any presentation: sometimes it needs to be slow, sometimes fast. Sometimes colour doesn't matter, sometimes it does. Look at the classics...they are classic for a reason. My personal preference would be a prop (Tiny torpedo, Crippled shad), buzzbait,  or a walk-the-dog (spook, sammy). For some reason, I am cursed when it comes to poppers."
219697,Fishn Technishn,2008-06-26 01:14:00,198,"My personal fave is the Excalibur(now Heddon) ""Spittin' Image"" in Shad colour. Have caught MANY bass, Musky, Walleye and my PB bluegill( was the size of a large dinner plate!!) Only problem with them is you have to watch for seagulls Ospreys etc as they think they are real!  FT"
219704,fishing n autograph,2008-06-26 01:32:00,2540,"heddon tiny torpedo, blue fox holopopper, white pond hopper buzz bait...works awesome"
219705,Dozer,2008-06-26 01:37:00,896,Anything that floats.
219706,BillsTheBassMan,2008-06-26 01:40:00,932,"Rapala always produces a quality lure. What I have been impressed with recently though is the Berkley Frenzy Popper.  It seems to be able to cover tons of water.  Whereas I am still relatively unexperienced myself, I feel a great deal of confidence in this lure.  I generally start with a faster retrieve and then slow it down and mix it up to see what pattern is working for the conditions.  The fish always like something, it's just a matter of figuring out what that is!"
219708,bullybass,2008-06-26 01:46:00,144,I hear you fishn technishn I caught a seagull on Scugog on a chug bug.... got it to the boat and released it safely.... you really gotta watch at times.... oh no here comes a gull.... burn that bait back to the boat!!!
219440,Marko,2008-06-25 15:23:00,854,"Hey guys, novice bass fisherman here. Heard some guys at work today how much fun it is to fish on top water bait, i am just wondering what are some of the better top water bait for bass. Never fished this way for bass, but seen it done on tv. It looked like they would cast as far as they could and then reel the lure in as fast as possible, looked like more work then fun. I am prety sure thats how they cover water fast and find fish. Any pointers would be appricated Ty for your time"
219443,kemper,2008-06-25 15:39:00,2232,"Berkely frenzy poppers have been my best, I fish topwater for bass as often as I can because its wicked fun and it produces!  Grab a handful of poppers, i find colour does not really matter at all, although I have found that the ones which produce the best have EYES, and a tail feather on the back treble. Fire it out over shallowish water, although you can even get the out of the deep and vary your retrieve. twitch, twitch, stop. pull, tiwtch twitch and so on.  The main thing about fishin toppies, is to WAIT UNTIL YOU FEEL THE FISH.  If you dont, your hookset will come firing back at the boat at a high rate of speed, probably impaling your fishing buddy.\   play safe."
219445,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-25 15:44:00,3761,"I also like the poppers with the feathered treble on the back. Try some Matzuo poppers, they work best for me. Also if you can get your self a Heddon Zara Spook."
219449,Reef Runner,2008-06-25 15:57:00,981,"Storm chug bug is my fave.  You can use a topwater in deeper water to.  Just make BIG noise on the surface and pause.  In deeper parts, concentrate over humps, saddles and vegetation."
219453,Stoty,2008-06-25 16:12:00,2910, AMEN BROTHER! I swear by Chug Bugs.
219456,BillM,2008-06-25 16:23:00,17367,"Zara Spook Jr's.  Easily the best topwater bait I've used.  When most bass hit they won't make much commotion at all.  They don't snap at baits and come out of the water like pike do.  Bass, especially big ones will suck in the topwater lure like a giant vacuum.  As mentioned before, don't strike on the hit, strike on the weight"
219463,kentooley,2008-06-25 16:42:00,208,I notice nobody specifies largemouth or smallmouth. Will these work for both?
219464,jdmls,2008-06-25 16:44:00,575,"  Yup the Zara spooks are the best in my eye's as well...plus they keep you concentrated on keeping the ""walk the dog"" rythem going steady....I find the stop and wait theory's for most top water lures make them boring to fish with.."
219465,jediangler,2008-06-25 16:44:00,1923,"I only fish topwater at night and use only black jitterbugs. Cast and let it sit for 60 seconds, then reel at the speed that gives you the most pop, pop, pop noise. Stop occasionally, then start reeling again. Remember don't set the hook until you feel the weight of the fish. When you get a hit it will sound like someone just flushed a toilet."
219473,kemper,2008-06-25 17:02:00,2232,"Topwaters are also a great ALL DAY bait. Last summer two of my three biggest bass (4lb 2oz and 4lb 6oz) came on topwaters at mid day, sun high and bright.  I find that fished slowly, they can entice the big girls out of the thick weeds when the sun is bright and nothing else seems to be working. I would say that during my main fishing week in the summer where I am on buckhorn lake for 7 days I boat probably 40% of my bass on topwaters, and they are usually responsible for the big bass of the week trophy ( I am the proud owner of 5 of the last 6 years)."
219475,JohnF,2008-06-25 17:06:00,3494,"I've got a few boxes of topwaters - Rapalas, minnows, popper style, other brands - if we get together on the weekend you're welcome to try some out. If Rob's with us he'll show you his method. All he fishes is the Rapala floating minnows and they sure seem to work well for him. I fiddle with everything I can get my hands on, usually with less success than him, except for those evenings when the bass are partial to plastic.  JF"
219476,limeyangler,2008-06-25 17:08:00,5204,Chug Bugs are awesome!!! and topwater fishing is definitely one of my favourites....great for pike too...love seeing a pike launch 2 feet outta the lake to whack the lure!!!
219478,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-25 17:10:00,3761,Does anyone have a picture of some of these baits: maybe a Chug Bug?
219479,kemper,2008-06-25 17:10:00,2232,"  Buckhorn lake 21"". 4lb 4oz  Frenzy popper middle of the day.   I LOVE TOPWATERS"

219490,rpsmith,2008-06-25 17:19:00,28,Tiny torpedo in leopard frog is great for large mouth!!!
219494,Musky or Specks,2008-06-25 17:30:00,2710,Rebel PopR in bone work it slow or aggresive always produces. Also a spook for walkin the dog.

219506,JohnF,2008-06-25 17:47:00,3494, I got one of those last summer and tried it one evening on a good pond. I stayed on the water till it was dark and got nada. Mebbe it's not a good dusk type lure. It's the only time I tried it but I've got it in the box to try again this year.  Maybe Marko can show me how to use it properly.  JF
219527,Marko,2008-06-25 18:05:00,854," Maybe i got the lucky touch? I am trying to learn here myself lol. Thank you guys for your replies, placed couple of bids on ebay for couple Berkly Frenzy poppers with feathered trebbles. checked out prices on HeddonZara spook baites, quite pricey.  I hope it doesnt rain too much John. Murky water cant be that good for top water lures. Let me know whats going on later in the week sometimes."
219531,BillM,2008-06-25 18:11:00,17367,"The spooks are worth it  The Jr's have internal rattles which the full sized ones don't.  If you can get a your timing down on the WTD technique, not much can refuse them."
219534,JohnF,2008-06-25 18:12:00,3494, The water's kinda milky here for the moment but if the rain isn't too bad before the weekend it should flush out. Don't spend a bunch of money till you try some of the stuff I've got here. Mebbe you'll find a few that work for you. Then you can spend your money without gambling. I know that's contrary to every fisherman's natural instinct. What is it about us that we can't resist buying every shiny bit we see on the shelf? If only the fish were as easily conned as us.  JF
219540,modny,2008-06-25 18:17:00,502,"  i caught a nice 20 inch bucket mouth in BOQ last summer around 8 am on one.. it put up a ncie fight.  i've also had good luck with heddon tiny torpedo's    suspending minnow color husky jerks are great too, although they aren't TW"
