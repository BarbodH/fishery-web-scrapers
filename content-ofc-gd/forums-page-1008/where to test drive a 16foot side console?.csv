I still think I'd prefer a 16ft tiller, but if a good deal is to be had on a side console, I'd like to know how I like driving it and such.........  maybe I need to arrange a fishing trip with somebody with a 16foot side console with a 40 or 60hp motor......  Thanks,  Scott"

He's got some G3s and a few older Princecrafts that are pretty sweet.  I should ask them if they'd be able to set me up with a test ride.  I guess I'd probably like to drive to Barrie or Orillia to take a cruise in a 16ft side console, but would also consider the Kawartha's as far away as Peterborough.  I head over to Balsam and Pigeon to fish once a year.........I should spend an afternoon looking for a dealer to take me for a ride.  Scott"
