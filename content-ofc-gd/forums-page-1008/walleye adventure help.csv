Im talking about the kind of place where I can go and know that the walleye are abundant and willing to bite all day long. I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions about where I might go in search of this place, hopefully within a 3 hr drive of the GTA.  If this is impossible, Ill take any suggestions and maybe drive longer if need be.  Oh, I promise ill bring shore lunch for you all!  thanks in  advance"
219013,kemper,2008-06-24 16:22:00,2232,I guess I should add that I am NOT looking for your secret spot...more a general area that I could search for water.
219023,Musky or Specks,2008-06-24 17:02:00,2710,It kills me how people think that stuff like this can be found within three hours of GTA. The kawarthas have plenty of walleye but thats as close as your going to get. If you looking for remote and plentiful you'll have to trvel farther. My choice would be Biscotasing-Ramsey Lake.
219032,jdmls,2008-06-24 17:16:00,575,"pretty muc hit it on the head for you Kemper.....If there was crazy walleye fishing 3 hours from Toronto , it wouldn't be crazy for very long , LOL !!  From what I have collected shore fishing the Grand is producing the most walleye right now.....that's only about 1:45 from the Shwa...."
219045,bucktail,2008-06-24 18:05:00,1857,Eyes in Quinte have been hitting very well over the last few weeks. Within 3 hours of T.O. your best bets for numbers are Erie or Quinte.
219049,solopaddler,2008-06-24 18:14:00,8605,"As the boys mentioned what you're looking for doesn't exist that close to T.O., especially a river. The closest thing to what you want would either be the Upper Ottawa river, or the lower French, specifically the Bad River where it spills into Georgian Bay.  Lakes are a different story. There's literally countless opportunities if you're willing to drive further. I'll agree with Ramsey/Bisco as well, great fisheries. There's a couple of really wicked lakes north of the Sultan Road as well  ."
