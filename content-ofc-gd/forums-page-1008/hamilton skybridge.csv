While I was driving under the bridge, I saw few people fishing by the docks.  It did look nice place for shore fishing as it was open water to Lake Ontario.  What I want to know is what can I catch from under the skybridge this time of the year?  I might drop by this weekend if I get a chance.  Thanks."
