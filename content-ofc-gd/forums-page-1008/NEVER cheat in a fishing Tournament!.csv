219573,oncogene,2008-06-25 19:24:00,154,lol for the $500 payout?
219575,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-25 19:26:00,2585,what a dumb --- for a 20 pound fish to boot?  wow hope people learn from this guy  cheers!
219589,kentooley,2008-06-25 20:00:00,208,I said this on the other board too. What a knob!  :lol:  Looks good on him.

219602,glen,2008-06-25 20:20:00,2641,Putting a one pound weight into a fish has got me lots of girls    The theory of evolution is in question at this time.
219609,Roy,2008-06-25 20:32:00,13728,I guess the Zoomer might have to stop selling the video of a 2006 episode they did with him.
219611,fishnsled,2008-06-25 20:36:00,3520,"What an     Wondering when the club will call that ""emergency meeting""  to deal with this clown.  There were a couple of guys in a bass tourney a few years ago that got caught for caging fish.  Banished from tournaments forever.  This guy should be getting that and ousted from the club from his peers at the very least.  As for the legal charges, not sure about jail time or not but several hours of community service with the MNR, lake/river clean up or stocking programs??  Loss of his fishing licence wouldn't be a bad idea as well."
219642,Rich,2008-06-25 22:40:00,3927,When I read this I was in complete shock. I would have never thought he would do something like that. That's all I'm gonna say.
219646,Gerritt,2008-06-25 22:59:00,6129,So you know him then Rich? give MoriaMan his address... he wants to kick everyones ass LOL!  G

219713,joonmoon,2008-06-26 02:04:00,528, What a LOOOOOOOSER. Hope he burns bigtime for his STUPIDITY....lol.....hahaha.  Good for the organizers to have a second look at that fish.
219775,jace,2008-06-26 10:40:00,472,"weird that they would catch it.  In my opinion, 1# difference in a fish would be very hard to detect by eyeballing it.  Salmon weight to length ratios have huge variations, some fish are very thin while others can be very fat, there's even a huge difference between male and female.   One pound is the difference between a fish that just ate something and one with an empty stomach.  Anyways, in most of the big prize derbies i enter, the fish are always cut open after the official weigh-in so nobody is tempted to try this...not with lead anyways."

Good for Andy for dealing with this the way it should be dealt with-the law- fraud is fraud! Impress his wife? give me a brake! shouldve stuffed the weight in his pants!"
219837,LeXXington,2008-06-26 14:29:00,1928,The humiliation is more than enough punishment

219901,Rombo,2008-06-26 17:03:00,39,Why not just jam a few minnows into the live well and let the fish gain its own weight. Not that its the right thing to do but how stupid is putting a sinker down its mouth
219911,bushart,2008-06-26 17:27:00,2628,Impress his wife? give me a brake! shouldve stuffed the weight in his pants!    The way this guy was working he'd probably stuff down the back side of his pants
