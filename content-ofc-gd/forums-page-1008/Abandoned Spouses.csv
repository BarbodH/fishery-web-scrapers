217104,ccmtcanada,2008-06-19 02:36:00,7971,"As far as I'm concerned, you can stay on the board....those brothers can leave....haha.  You have a great sense of humour...I hope you keep on posting once they are back.  My wife (Bly on the board) and I are heading up there Friday afternoon....will let them know you are running amok on here.....hehe"
217105,JohnF,2008-06-19 02:36:00,3494, Fish?  JF
217116,Joey,2008-06-19 03:02:00,9122,"Hahahaha, welcome aboard Becky.  I'm heading up Friday night so I'll make sure they boyz behave themselves.  I'll make up a good story about your thread and put a good scare into Joe.  Tell him you went through his ""history"" and he has some splainin to do  Joey"
217164,Whopper,2008-06-19 12:22:00,2174, Kind of like the blind leading the blind eh!
217165,TJQ,2008-06-19 12:27:00,7806, What????   Stinkin' Joe.... and fishing.. they didnt actually tell you they were going fishing....  Hey...  ya know...  I bet you got some cool pictures of those dudes you could post while they were gone.....
217173,wuchikubo,2008-06-19 12:51:00,1114, Welcome to the board Becky.  I'll second that!  
217176,JohnF,2008-06-19 12:58:00,3494," She mentioned getting sozzled on wine. Mayhap in her inebriated state she forgot the pics. I'm sure we could all come up with a bunch for her - or Joe, as the case may be.  Besides, I think she was a fake. She had none of the Southern Belle manner about her. Virginia gals are supposed to say stuff like y'all, grits and corn likker. She sounded more like a Massachusetts college girl with her fine wine and Yankee vocabulary. Mebbe she was really one of Joe's paramours checking up on him? Who knows how many ""fishing"" trips he goes on in a year?  JF"
217191,snag,2008-06-19 13:30:00,1932,LakAir is next week.   I know a good lawyer.
217221,splashhopper,2008-06-19 14:49:00,2931,  hmmm..  Daplumma is away fishing and now u are buying drinks for his girl ?
217390,camillj,2008-06-19 22:50:00,1988,"Hmmm ... sounds like there trouble a-brewing ... I am sure thats wasnt Joe .. it was someone who looked exactly like him .... maybe it was Art ????  No worries Becky, Lakair is all work and NOOOO fun ..."
217399,Clampet,2008-06-19 23:29:00,1947, Pa says we can't go cause GCD can't keep his ole paws off'n me.
217424,Becky,2008-06-20 01:16:00,10,You all are just hysterical! I promise to post some incriminating pics shortly.  Becky
217426,JohnF,2008-06-20 01:18:00,3494, Y'all dammit. It's y'all. Virginia wimmen never say you all.  JF
217428,Terry,2008-06-20 01:24:00,14456,"I guess no one told her, everyone else to their wives to Lakair   oh well welcome aboard"
217431,pigeonfisher,2008-06-20 01:27:00,696,I am an ex-pat and former lakair'er...It is a lot of fun.  but this particular weekend I am happy to be here where I am.
217442,Daplumma,2008-06-20 01:46:00,1961,Sorry for the lack o' pics...no Photoshop on this computer and the size limit is prohibitive.  Hope all of you in Lakair are having fun.  No trade on the puppies. They are more precious than the boyZ.  Becky
217444,Daplumma,2008-06-20 01:47:00,1961,Ack! I'm logged in as Joe. No wonder I felt so strange...
217446,danc,2008-06-20 01:49:00,4677, Aren't you the dude with the migrating tent?
217448,Becky,2008-06-20 01:53:00,10,"NORTHERN Virginia, Dan C. And Dawg left me the corn squeezin's so I'll be saying y'all before too much longer.  Becky"
217453,JohnF,2008-06-20 02:05:00,3494, Do they put strawberries in that likker fer y'all?  JF
217480,johnnyb,2008-06-20 03:30:00,3413,"Wow....miss a day, miss a LOT!  This is great"
217506,pigeonfisher,2008-06-20 11:23:00,696,"  Accidently put a tent on a hill once and it is with you for life.  I brought no food that weekend and ate like a king.  I did bring my liquor cabinet though, made for easy trading partners.  Even caught a fish."
217707,Becky,2008-06-21 00:41:00,10,"Hey if anyone sees Joe, tell him to call home so he can tell me how to fix the darn DISH TV. Grandpa was pushing the buttons again, and we've got nuthin'  Thanks all!  Becky"
217739,Joey,2008-06-21 01:59:00,9122,"Will do Becky.  I""m heading up late tonight, as soon as my husband gets off afternoon shift.  I'll tell him to give his dish a ring  Joey"
219246,Greencoachdog,2008-06-25 01:34:00,8163,"Ahhh!!! The lovely Miss Becky!!!  It was truly a pleasure to meet you and to enjoy y'alls hospitality!!! The bacon and eggs at 11 pm on Sunday night were certainly above and beyond the call of duty!!!  Joe is a very lucky guy to have a woman as sweet, charming, good looking, and as good of a cook as you are!!!  Thanks again for your gracious hospitality!!!  All the personnel in the Virginia chapter of the Southern Contingency are truly class acts!!!"
217048,Becky,2008-06-19 00:59:00,10,This'll teach Joe to go off to Canada and leave me all alone with his computer...  How's the trip going up there you guys?  Becky (Spouse of Daplumma)
217052,danc,2008-06-19 01:02:00,4677,Becky. You can hang around right here with me this weekend. What's your choice of beverage? I'm buying.
217054,HTHM,2008-06-19 01:11:00,4082,"Us Canadian aint so bad......we'll see that he gets home safe. So,,,,, does that mean this weekend you can be misbehavin??? I'm sure Joe will behave....right guys??? Welcome to the board!"
217055,Raf,2008-06-19 01:15:00,3495,"Hahah, I personally think this is a great thread and only good things can come of this.  Welcome aboard Becky."
217059,huntervasili,2008-06-19 01:21:00,1604, I agree... this is going to be a good one for someone to explain to him...
217062,Becky,2008-06-19 01:26:00,10,"Thanks all.  It sure is quiet (and clean) around the here without Joe and Art and their Dad. The stupid dogs miss them.  On the plus side, I almost killed the darn rooster yesterday. Sadly, he still lives...don't tell Joe.  On the double plus side, I have the good bottle of wine to myself.  Do you guys know if anyone is catching fish at the ""get together?"""
217064,Becky,2008-06-19 01:28:00,10,"I just realized I'm chatting with the fishing gods of this board...all-knowing angler, fishing icon, etc. Wow! I am so cool :-)"
217065,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:28:00,1578," Things are probably going just fine with them, as long as they stay away from Greencoachdog's Grandma's secret recipe, lol  Hope you and Rocket are keeping in good spirits!!!!!!!!"
217066,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:29:00,1578,Was that Elvis you almost killed today????????
217067,Rizzo,2008-06-19 01:32:00,4754,man I wish this was the kind of snooping my wife would do!
217068,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:33:00,1578,Haven't seen any reports or pictures yet form Lakair. They will probably trickle in starting tomorrow night.
217069,Becky,2008-06-19 01:33:00,10,Dawg left a jar of the good stuff here for me...heck of a nice guy.  Elvis has left the building...next up was Wayne Newton (he lasted a week). Now we have Sammy Davis Jr. (AKA Silly Hat) and I hate that stinking thing. He tries to spur me when I'm feeding the girls their treats.  One time he had Joe screaming like a girl (OK like me) and running down the driveway to get away form him.  He's evil I tell ya. Like the animals from the Indian Burial Ground Pet Shop in South Park (it was on last night)
217071,danc,2008-06-19 01:34:00,4677,I say that we get rid of Joe and keep Becky here. All in favor??? Say
217072,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:36:00,1578," A 9 iron will take care of him,"
217074,Becky,2008-06-19 01:37:00,10,"You guys are so nice! Joe was totally wrong about all of you.  Too bad I don't know squat about fish except how to cook them, but at least my spelling is better than Joe's.  Becky"
217075,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:37:00,1578,  :jerry:  :jerry:  :jerry:
217076,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-19 01:38:00,2585,"welcome to the board, keep checking in, im sure there will be updates.  i know its cold up there, much colder then normal for this time of year.  cheers!"
217077,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:38:00,1578," You got that darned right for sure, the spelling comment,"
217078,Becky,2008-06-19 01:40:00,10,"Too bad I can't type.  I'll check back for the Lakair updates. Hope everyone stays warm.  From balmy Virginia,  Becky"
217079,tjsa,2008-06-19 01:41:00,1578,"Nite Becky, will check in tomorrow to see if you are around.  tjsa the ""Lily White Hoser"", lol"
217085,HTHM,2008-06-19 01:53:00,4082, You got a great sense  of humour!
217090,Dondorfish,2008-06-19 02:02:00,1000,   WE LIKE PICTURES!  - LOL  Don
217092,douG,2008-06-19 02:06:00,2693,"Rebecka, You are so in around here already.  You got the words AND the tune down cold.  Welcome, and I promise to look after the Melancon dudes with almost a whole eye open."
217094,douG,2008-06-19 02:08:00,2693,"Pass this message on to Ol' Yeller as well, if you might be so kind."
217103,huntervasili,2008-06-19 02:31:00,1604, Ask Joe what I told him I'd trade for one of the dogs... I know how to get rid of one for ya
