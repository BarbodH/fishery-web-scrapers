218863,napjohn8,2008-06-24 03:31:00,46,i dealt with a brown haired lady who was a little on the bigger side last year when i was fishing the small ponds on the east side of the park. I told her to take a hike and it may be the same one your talking about. It makes me sick people have nothing better to do then worry other peoples days. I told her to call the police and she left.
218865,bigfish1965,2008-06-24 03:39:00,3382,That law has no teeth. Trespass to property act requires more than a land use violation. Standing in the water would negate the sign anyway. Either you can be there or not..the usage is irrelevant.
219121,bbnotty,2008-06-24 20:57:00,93,"Hey napjohn, the lady had brown hair but not really on the big side my friend says. just very rude. Rick, no signs at that park - yet - . i went for a walk at the park today and saw a few people fishing. maybe she only gets out in the evening. That law may have no teath but i don't think too many people have the time to test it out.  Berge"

219221,Hillrat,2008-06-25 01:00:00,10,lol
219608,dsn,2008-06-25 20:30:00,1018,"Ah man, I told her not to yell at people for fishing but only chase those who take the fish for consumtion cause the carp are going exstint in those bays. Ok I'll have to talk to my wife again.  dsn"

218836,Sinker,2008-06-24 02:44:00,8692,"TRCA is not a governing agency. They have no right to tell anyone where or when to fish. They could politley suggest you read the fishing regulations if in fact you were doing something wrong....which in this case, I don't think they were.  I'd go back to the same spot if I was him, and ask a few more questions this time. She can be fined for interfering with legal fishing.....I would have her charged, just to teach her a lesson.
