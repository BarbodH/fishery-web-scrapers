218682,cpguy29,2008-06-24 00:00:00,148,Headed out on lake Scugog Sunday morning with a fellow board member grilw(Greg). Tried for some musky....first spot had a small guy follow a spinner bait to the boat. After a few rock bass moved to the mouth of the Noguon river...hmm nothing. On to the next spot...Greg nailed this one on a perch pattern husky jerk.    About an hour later while moving along with the electric motor I see 2 muskies take off in opposite directions. Start casting to the direction one of them headed and this guy hit.    Along with those fish we had tons of panfish and 2 largemouth to keep us busy.
218691,muskymike,2008-06-24 00:07:00,772,Nice Job guys. Nice early season skis.
218693,Rich,2008-06-24 00:09:00,3927,Nice. That second one looks like a musky with a desk job. LOL not a mark on it. Awesome.
218708,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 00:22:00,7971,Awesome stuff guys!  That lake can be tough at times...great to see success there!
218721,tdotfisherman,2008-06-24 00:41:00,317,Two very decent looking Muskys there.. These Scugog Musky reports are really making me itch to get myself up there and give er' a go..
218728,tbayboy,2008-06-24 00:45:00,1497,Great to see the bog represented in all these musky reports.   Love fishing that lake even the weeds drive me batty at times.

218746,jediangler,2008-06-24 01:04:00,1923,"Great looking fish. It's been awhile since I tried for a Scugog ski, maybe later this week."
218751,figureight,2008-06-24 01:07:00,40,nice job
218766,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:21:00,7971, Weeds aren't too bad yet...give it 4 weeks and you'll be cleaning your prop as often as you are picking weeds off your lure....hehe.
218888,cpguy29,2008-06-24 08:56:00,148,Ah..the old Scugog prop clean...classic.
218903,Victor,2008-06-24 11:31:00,1609,"Nice fish guys, great to see greg still alive and kicking as well"
218928,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-24 12:52:00,0,Great report and nice musky! I was wondering what happened to Greg. Did you guys get caught in that freak storm????
219630,glirw,2008-06-25 21:41:00,200,"Totally missed this report!  It sure was a heckuva day. What was supposed to be a day with thunderstorms and rain turned out to be nothing but sunshine, which also meant that the muskie/walleye fishing shut right down.  Saturday can't get here soon enough!"
