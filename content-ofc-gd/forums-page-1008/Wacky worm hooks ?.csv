219265,duber,2008-06-25 02:08:00,220,Well its only 4 sleeps away boys and girls  .After a slow day of walleye fishing I am switching over to bass mode and double checking my gear.While going threw my terminal tackel I got to thinking about the hooks I use for wacky worming.I use just regular worm hooks but I'm thinking that a smaller thinner hook would be better. Just thought I would ask you all what you use.  Thanks to all replies
219277,salmon,2008-06-25 02:30:00,334,VMC 1/0 circle hooks. 99.9% of the time the bass are hooked in the corner of the mouth Jose
219281,tbayboy,2008-06-25 02:41:00,1497,"ditto on the 1/0 circle hooks.  Tried them for the first time last year and they're great, especially for the wacky rigging  - notice much less deep hooking happening (or I was getting better at reading the line twitches - probably both)."
219294,Garry2Rs,2008-06-25 02:55:00,1425,I use a 3/0 EWG hook.  It's easier to remove than smaller hooks.

219306,Garry2Rs,2008-06-25 03:29:00,1425,"Gamakatsu Wide Gaps, Zappu Inchi Wacky Head , Decoy Wacky Worm Hooks  Okay that's a nice selection of brand names, but the question was size, not label!"
219309,mbac31,2008-06-25 03:50:00,904, Check first!! I read the question. These are all very small and thin. The Decoy's are very thin and razor sharp. Zappu hook I buy at Trembleys in Orillia and are very small and sharp.  I beleive he asked what you use.  I can post pics and actuall sizes if it makes ya happy!!!!
219316,mistyriver1,2008-06-25 04:02:00,600,I like the 3/0 as well and alot of the time I use the tube hooks with weight to get them down through the cabbage faster.
