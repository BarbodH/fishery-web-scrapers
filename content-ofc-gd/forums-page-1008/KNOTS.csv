219472,jdmls,2008-06-25 16:58:00,575,palomar is what i use for braid....not to mention every other line as well...easiest and hard to screw up
219483,brooks999,2008-06-25 17:14:00,38, ++++++1  Polomar .... Our 11 yr old ties it
219488,Reef Runner,2008-06-25 17:17:00,981,"Palomar all the way.  Was the first knot my Dad taught me, used it for years even before I knew what it was called. Learn the palomar, uni and uni-to-uni and your pretty much covered your fishing needs. I don't have any pics though, sorry."
219514,Bly,2008-06-25 17:53:00,1556,"I think your knot questions has been answered lol, so I will just add a ""good fishes"" to you this summer, look forward to seeing some pictures and reports!"
219655,misfish,2008-06-25 23:39:00,29133,Palomar knot.I will agree. Just remember to leave a bit of a tag.
