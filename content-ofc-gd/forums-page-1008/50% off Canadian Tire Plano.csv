219770,jace,2008-06-26 10:05:00,472,"yeah, that's it.   I thought it might  be the one below it until i saw the dimensions.  The other one is much larger the model you guessed was the one for $9 for sure.    A friend bought 4 of them, i didn't get any thinking they were too small and soon regretted it."
219798,jughead,2008-06-26 12:37:00,92,"I bought a couple, they hold 4 trays each and I find it easier to organize my tackle for species and then by lure. I can carry everything I need for bass in one bag, same for walleye, etc., usually three trays and the extra room for soft plastics."
219800,PHISHY!,2008-06-26 12:40:00,24,I picked one up last year and you just can't enough of these little guys.  I have mine sorted out by species.  Handy that way!
