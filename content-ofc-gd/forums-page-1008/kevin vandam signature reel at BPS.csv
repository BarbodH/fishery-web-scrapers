219179,Rustic-Fisher,2008-06-24 23:40:00,826,Go for it BPS is sold out of them!!!!  Rustic
219182,Gerritt,2008-06-24 23:47:00,6129,"PS... All American Outdoors, alot of time carries BPS reels for less then BPS does!!! Go Figure..  Great company to deal with, with VERY competitive prices. They have made a repeat customer out of me!  G"
219238,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-25 01:25:00,2585,"my experience is your paying for the name on the rod not the actual rod.  I found this out with Bob izumi spinners, exact same ones without his face on it was 2 buck less.  Be careful when our buying an endorsed product like that.  It may be a great rod but you may be able to find the same one cheaper without the big name on it.  Cheers!"
219288,Garry2Rs,2008-06-25 02:45:00,1425,"Okay if they're all gone it's a moot point, but... First of all it is Kevin not Ken VanDam. Second the reel is a Quantum not a Bass Pro Shop reel. This reel is priced well below Quantum's best reels, but it has 9+1 bearings and a flipping switch. At $79.00 it looks like a bargain to me."
219317,mistyriver1,2008-06-25 04:09:00,600,"I picked one up when I was down in tennesse in March.  I've only used it twice (casting for pike)but am very impressed.  I got the ""burner"" edition with the 7:0 retreive.  I coupled it with an extreme BPS rod which were also on sale for $60 at the time.  A 7'6"" heavy telescopic.  It'll be my flippin combo."
219664,robinwood,2008-06-26 00:00:00,28,"well, I called bps today- no point going to get one if there are none, and yes there are none, person on the phone said they were re-called !! by the manufacturer - so I guess someone is  in some (Van)  Dam trouble! after running a half page ad in the (van) Dam flyer - still looked like a good deal if the (van) Dam things were available!"
219674,NBR,2008-06-26 00:33:00,163,My fishing pal has had 2 of them for 3 or 4 years and bought another this year. He thinks they are fine.
219765,jace,2008-06-26 09:59:00,472,"A friend got this one thinking it looked cool but thinks it's kinda junky after using it.  It doens't seem well designed internally because he had problems with a sticky clutch after a while.  I saw it and thought  that they copied TeamDaiwa's cool swept handle and everything but it looks good but the overall lack of precision in the gearing mechanisms was obvious.  At the same time, we're talking about a sub $100 reel so you can't expect an exceptional flawless reel at that price point.   I can't say anyhting about the previous KVD models other than they sure look like a reworked version of the Accurists"
219792,aplumma,2008-06-26 12:03:00,6896,It's a shame you havent had a chance to hold the quantum you would not still be looking at the other reel still.... If you want a second opinion of the reel PM Spiel and ask him if he like the two he ordered.   Art
