As Ben Franklin said: ""In wine there is wisdom, in beer there is freedom, in water there is bacteria.""  In a number of carefully controlled trials, scientists have demonstrated that if we drink 1 liter of water each day, at the end of the year we would have absorbed more than 1 kilo of Escherichia coli, (E. coli) - bacteria found in feces. In other words, we are consuming 1 kilo of poop. However, we do NOT run that risk when drinking wine & beer (or tequila, rum, whiskey or other liquor) because alcohol has to go through a purification process of boiling, filtering and/or fermenting.  Remember: Water = Poop, Wine = Health  Therefore, it's better to drink wine and talk stupid, than to drink water and be full of crap.
