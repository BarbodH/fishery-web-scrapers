With any GPS if you only drive to places you're familiar with it's just a toy, but if you travel or have to find unfamiliar addresses, they're outstanding. You get turn by turn instructions to get you through the trickiest ""ring-roads,"" interchanges or the shortest route to the yard sale...grin.. Recently I went to look at a boat.  I keyed in the address and drove up to the house like I'd been there before.  Same thing when I was looking for Hometown Handyman's place in the country...Turn by turn right up to his door. I haven't really used the features that find stores, banks and restaurants etc;, but if I have an address, the machine can find it. You can also put any place you are already at into memory, like the boat launch at Moon River...give it a name in Favourites, and the next time you want to go there the machine will walk you right up to the door.  That's nice if you're trying to find your way in the dark etc."
