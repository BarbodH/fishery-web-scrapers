218768,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:23:00,7971,"Brian....you are right about the photoshopping!!!  I had to look twice, but I think you got it wrong...  Everyone has photoshopped hair on your head...no the other way round.  Or, is that just your summer cut??? hehe."

219198,Marty,2008-06-25 00:18:00,873,"Tref,  Words can't express my thanks.   Dawson had the time of his life and watching him, all 5 years of him, enjoy himself was magical.   He never once complaied about being in the boat all day (he was the only one in the boat that wanted to fish in the downpour) and seeing the smile on his face with his first fish (rockbass) and his first pickeral and pike made his daddy and grandpapd so proud.  You played a huge part too helping him cook his fish and being a great host.  The members of this board are unbelievable.  Those of you who were there need to know the impact you had on my little boy's life.    Thanks a ton.  TJ, make sure you thank Jaden, Avery and Monique too.   With any luck, we could be inlaws some day."
