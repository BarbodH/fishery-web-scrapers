There are places available on net sites this year but thought I'd ask here first-anyone have or know of a private cottage for rent in the Kawartha's?  Two younger kids so good swimming is most important feature. Need a dock for my boat...and of course fishing matters   Place doesn't need to be on a trent severn lake but power boats must be allowed.  Not really interested in a resort with numerous cottages this trip, I'd like something quieter if possible."
