106665,OhioFisherman,2007-08-23 16:23:00,6623,"Stay away from Harrisburg?(3 mile Island) It glows in the dark? Tax structure is different than here Steve, never been to York."

107082,Marty,2007-08-24 15:32:00,873,"Hey FF, I'm a PA resident, I live pretty far from there but a law school classmate of mine is a judge there.  So, when you get drunk some night and end up in jail, I can make a call for you.   The other problem is that the football team on that end of the state sucks."
107190,pigeonfisher,2007-08-24 18:38:00,696,"thanks for the future bail out Marty.  I will PM you.  I need information on income tax, property tax and some of the other unrealized costs of living in the area.  I would assume (from having visited many times) that the social climate is very similar to the very small town that I live in now.  Moving into a new country is somewhat earth shattering though."
107191,Zib,2007-08-24 18:46:00,369, If you want some info from PA angler's check out his other site I belong to. There are a lot of guys on there that live in PA. http://www.fishin247.com/forum/index.php
