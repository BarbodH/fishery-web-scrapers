105801,tonyb,2007-08-21 15:38:00,1637,"Uncle Buck even managed a 10lb Round Goby!!! Call the papers!          At some point a bunch of sheysters (Paya, RJ, Hof, Robc [""So I've heard""], Gordo and his sidekick) showed up to meet Phil on the causeway.  We were going to go over and visit but we were getting fish, and the shade and cold beer was too much to walk away from    They finally came over to our site to meet-up for a short fishing session.  It was good to meet you guys and poop chat, albeit for a short period of time.      Seperated at Birth perhaps?     Dinner!        More fish...        And that's all I remember from Saturday night, I crawled into the tent after over 36 hours of straight fishing, my body shut down.  Phil is a maniac, he packed up sometime during the night and drove home.  He was up at least as long as I was, I don't know how he does it  Day 2!  Definately much slower in terms of the fishing, but we got a few once the sun came up...Goran kicked things off with a good representation of the average size of the majority of the fish...    This fish had a damaged mouth, obviously from a hook.  We did have a lot of 'hook-pulls' where we lost fish, and interestingly Jeff @ the Long Sault motel was saying the same thing he has been experiencing this year.          And you guys thought Boaters only crowded you when you were in a boat! These idiots drifted right through the swim like 3 times before we almost hit their boat with corn chum and they took the hint... :eek:                  Like this trip I'll have many stories to tell, but none will compare to the one this Chipmunk will be telling his pals about for the rest of it's life! ""There had to be 10000 kernels of corn, I was sitting on top filling my cheeks!""      Hope you enjoyed! Tony"
105893,MJL,2007-08-21 20:09:00,2427,That's some awesome hauling there guys
105950,highdrifter,2007-08-21 22:09:00,2534,"Now that was a great read!  I enjoyed that very much even though I'm not a carp angler...  It's reports like that that spark interest in the subject.  Nicely done MJL!  I'll keep an eye out for you next time I'm at the Islands..  I'll politely pick your brain then.  tight loops HD  P.S.  Hey Tonyb, you're mondo bizarro..  MJL and myself, including pretty much all carpers here on OFC, have seen that report a month ago.  Why on earth would you add your report on someone elses??  If this was my report, I'd stick it to ya. Shame.."
105956,redx,2007-08-21 22:15:00,60,To bad with this kinda weather carp fishing is dead... No biggy heard report of salmon all ready to swim up! and soon steelhead!
106156,tonyb,2007-08-22 14:44:00,1637,"It's relavant Highdrifter, that's all.  Carp anglers are a social bunch that share information, spots, and experiences, tactics etc.  A lot of people don't click external links in posts, so I figured I would add the pics directly into the message.  I just had to split them because there were so many...in retrospect, I should have done that initially with my own report.  My intent was to add to the viewing pleasure of those interested in a Carp report, sorry it came across the wrong way to you.  Tony  P.S. What exactly do you mean when you say I'm mondo bizarro?"
106172,highdrifter,2007-08-22 15:06:00,2534," Meaning out of whack, out of the ordinary.  Being social has nothing to do with it.  Pardon me if I seem opinionated, but I'm a leo.  If this was my report, I'd take it personally and feel that you'd be over-stepping it by doing something like that.  Wouldn't you?  No harm done though, the writer of this thread doesn't seem to mind.  You're a kewl guy and I have total respect, but that last one kinda threw me for a loop I must say."
106194,tonyb,2007-08-22 15:33:00,1637,"Interesting...I haven't been insulted and complimented at the same time ever.  Being social has everything to do with it, it's a key ingredient that makes fishing FUN.  Life is too short to take things personally (especially on an Internet forum) and not have fun in everything you do.  Hope to see you on the water, you gotta try modern Carp fishing too if you haven't already.  Tony"
107649,scuro,2007-08-26 01:01:00,386,"I too like to prepare. Excellent detailed report, it brought be there with you."
105036,MJL,2007-08-18 23:55:00,2427," I didn’t put it on a set of scales but it felt like it was around the 10lb neighbourhood (at least compared to the 10lb dumbbell I have in my room).  It was surprisingly dense for a fish that fat.  It loved the maize so much, I could barely open its mouth to get the hook out.  My former PB was a 2lber caught last year at Hamilton harbour.   That’s some good advice Clive.  I firmly believe that carp can become educated quickly and can spot rigs if they aren’t presented well.  I do a lot of stalking and see carp do things that most wouldn’t believe.  I personally use 12lb mono/copolymer/hybrid lines for about 90% of my carp fishing.  I usually bump up to 15lb if I’m having slight problems with zebra mussels.  It was on the recommendation from most the carp guides that work the St. Lawrence (like Jeff Vaughn, Paul Hunt, Tessa Bowling, Bernie Haines + a few others) to use braid/superlines in the 50+lb range (some recommended snag leaders up to 120+lb braid).  Jeff Vaughn uses 80lb PowerPro throughout.  The 50lb PowerPro that I was using has the same diameter as 12lb mono.  I did get cut-off twice during the trip and lost everything, but it was most likely my fault for not checking the line before casting out.  The tip about letting them run was spot on.  Dennis who firmly believed in the lock and hold method got cut-off more often than the number he landed.  I let my fish run till they stopped or at least till they slowed down and I applied enough pressure to turn them.  The thing about fishing the St. Lawrence was locating the underwater shelves and plateaus and making sure you knew where each was so that you could steer the fish (hopefully) away from the steep zebra mussel covered ledges – The area we were fishing at distance dropped from 35ft to 77ft in a matter of just a few feet.    Slim, sexy and very powerful...Sort of reminds me of myself    As far as fishing for carp over “gamefish”, it’s what I’ve been doing most of my life (I do fish for steelhead the rest of the year).  I got bit by the carp bug as a 5yr old at the local m.a.r.s.h and never looked back to panfish and bass (though once in a while I do put on a worm and fish for them).  The fact that they can be caught using various techniques is the reason why I like them so much. You can be stalking around the margins, fly fishing on shallow flats, using float and match tackle, top water fishing with floating dog food and bread, plunking down and sitting in the shade when it gets hot, etc.  For shore anglers,  they provide an excellent opportunity to catch big fish throughout the spring/summer/fall without requiring a boat + motor + trailer.  For kids (And basically anyone in general), they are an easily accessible species to catch because of their widespread nature across the province – There’s no need to drive 2+hrs from the city to catch fish as large as 60lbs in some areas (Yes 60+lbers have been recorded in this province). You can make carp fishing as easy or as complicated as you want although a snoopy rod might only be suitable for smaller fish (There are a few Snoopy rod junkies out there that would disagree).  As far as being a Carp junky goes…Don’t worry, most of my friends still don’t understand – Then again they have yet to catch a big carp…We all have different things we live for in life.  Different strokes for different folks…I always thought the people who fished for bass were a little strange, passing on the chance to catch a 30lb fish."
105038,MJL,2007-08-19 00:01:00,2427," The sling shot is used for getting bait (like corn, boillies, carp pellets, etc) into the water.  As far as the baiting needle goes, I just googled up the term ""hair rig"" and found this link: http://www.anglersnet.co.uk/Rig-Section/Ca...tless_Knot.html"
105041,canadianguy33,2007-08-19 00:08:00,121,"Thanks for the info MJL. I'm definitely going to give carp fishing a serious go.  Last year I went out and got some Berkley carp bait, put it on the hook and threw my line in with no luck. Surprise, surprise lol"
105054,Mike the Pike,2007-08-19 00:56:00,3421,Way to go MJL I wish I had of known you were going there I would have given you 2 of Long-Saults finest shore carp fishing spots.from the looks of your pics you were camping at millroches campground.I frequently camp in Long-Sault although I don't target carp I have caught some decent ones while fishing for walleye.Next time you go let me know.I know some real hot spots.MTP
105797,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 15:18:00,7971,"ACK!!! How did I miss this report???  First, let me say, when you go on a trip like this, at least put a little effort into the report....geez!!! LOL  Wow...what an amazing account of your trip!  The effort you put into everything from the prep, the scouting of locations and your perseverence through weather and lack of sleep certainly pays off with your results!  Some awesome pictures and good on you letting the little guy reel a carp in.  Great pictures to go with the report as well!  I haven't gone out targeting carp in a while, but once they come back in, I'll give it another try.  Thanks for the effort of this report....it was AMAZING!"
105800,tonyb,2007-08-21 15:38:00,1637,"Here is another report from the exact same site a week earlier  Finally!  After a couple of months of tracking down and purchasing my own modern Carp gear I was able to put it all to the test at the World famous Carp grounds of Long Sault.  You won't see too many signs like this around here, out east in the Long Sault region, Carp anglers are....well...    A BIG! Thanks to Phil (Big-o) for taking the bull by the horns and organizing this weekend, I had an awesome time and managed to catch a few fish and even less sleep over the weekend.  Sorry I didn't get to say goodbye on Saturday night...and you can pick up your bait needle and giant corn from Jeff at the motel...  Anyway...back to the report...  I had a brutal day on Friday and after spending about 10hrs in the car we arrived at the campground around 1am Saturday.  When Jonny (my buddy) and I got to the site Phil and Goran (Uncle Buck) were already set-up and had managed a couple of fish.  Time to get set-up and settle in for the evening...err morning fish  It wasn't long after the introductions and a cold beer that the first was landed, weighed, documented and photo'd          The rest of the night was fairly slow and by early morning Phil had decided to pack up and head across to fish from the causeway...He's way over there in the middle of the picture...    The sunrise came sooner than expected and fortunately I had the swim all to myself.    The other 'pups' had decided to get some beauty rest and unfortunately they missed a pretty hot morning of fishing...ouch  ""Sleep when you're dead!"" right Phil?  Quick Tip #1 - When using Baitrunner reels - ALWAYS check the correct position of the baitrunner switch, and make sure it is ON when you walk away from the rod!  Incorrect    Vs.  Correct    So here is the morning summary, I should have tried the self-timer as Phil reminded me later...Some small ones I just unhooked at the shore with the forceps, but I think I was 6/8 by the time the ladies awoke.  My new Pod, Rod, Reel and Alarms in action...    Fish!        Free Willy! This was my biggest of the weekend, 22.2lb        After taking a break I come back to the site to witness something strange occurring down by the water...here are the pictures, you can form your own conclusions...      Is he pulling up his pants? I knew I saw Jonny's eyes light up after Goran informed us that he enjoys the odd pedicure!  Back to fishing...    And lots of relaxing...Carp fishing has got to be the most relaxing form of fishing.  Cold beer, food, and the odd fish to add to a great social style of fishing, you gotta love it!    Uncle Buck doing the honours...      Some battle shots...              Continued..."
