The only cure is to go fishing and come to OFC for some relief.  Ps.  if you find a girl to go fishing with you marry her!  or If you find a girl that will tolerate you fishing marry her!   Cheers!
107763,Douger,2007-08-26 18:12:00,116,"I have dreams about catching fish, and often cannot sleep the night before a day of fishing.  I slow down and take a look every time a drive over a creek or river and can spend hours in a tackle shop without noticing the time go by.  I can spend even more time browsing fishing articles and videos on line.  sometimes i go downstairs, pull out my reel, and give it a spin,  just because.  dude, with the amount of posts on this thread it's easy to see you're not alone."

Confessions of a 'problem angler'  Sault Star (ON) Sat 03 Mar 2007 Page: E1 Section: Weekender Byline: Source:  Do you log every waking hour longing to cast, feel the hard strike and bring in that prize catch? If so, you might just have a 'reel' angling addiction. In the following piece, outdoor writer James Smedley does some deep self-analysis. It's clear he's hooked  Why is it the more we fish the more we want to fish. Spring, summer, winter or fall, for just about any species under the sun, it does not seem to matter how much fishing we do it never seems to quench that long angling thirst. I count myself among those with an all-consuming preoccupation with fishing. And I'm not the only one out there. You know who you are. Sensible, intelligent men and women whose compulsion to angle supersedes all other responsibilities and activities. Although this is the norm for many anglers, the question remains, is it normal and more pointedly, is it a problem?  In searching for answers I came across the Alcoholics Anonymous website. AA asks a series of 12 questions to help us determine if our drinking is a problem. Answering yes to any four of the 12 questions indicates a problem drinker. I took the liberty of adapting these questions to apply to anglers by simply replacing the word ""drinking"" with ""fishing."" If you've ever suspected that you might have a problem controlling your fishing, answer the following questions honestly. If you are like me, or the like-minded anglers I know, I think you'll find some disturbing parallels. Answer yes to four or more of the following questions and you could fit the profile of a problem angler.  1. Have you ever decided to stop fishing for a week or so, but only lasted for a couple of days? Yes, we've set up a schedule without angling but next thing you know we're on the lake at the first opportunity. A spell of warm weather, the rumour of a walleye bite, steelhead rushing up the rivers; there's never a shortage of things to trigger a fishing trip.  2 Do you wish people would mind their own business about your fishing, stop telling you what to do? Yes, there is just so much angling to do, so many new techniques and products to try it's overwhelming. Being told to slow down or that you've fished enough seems so ridiculous it's infuriating.  3. Have you ever switched from one kind of fishing to another in the hope that this would keep you from getting intoxicated? Yes, we've gone from ice fishing walleye to fly fishing trout. But you name it, even fishing perch from a dock becomes an all- consuming practice that we take extremely seriously and become totally intoxicated by the process.  4. Have you had to have an eye-opener upon awakening during the past year? Oh yes, just to get going, or worse, to stop the shaking, we've all tip toed down to the dock for a few casts and the next thing we know we're in the boat and gone for the day.  5. Do you envy people who can fish without getting into trouble? At one time or another, most of us have wondered why we were not like most people, who really can take it or leave it. We wonder where others find the strength to stop fishing when they said they would. We wonder how other people can sleep in on weekends and actually make it home off the lake in time for supper.  6. Have you had health problems connected with fishing during the past year? We tell ourselves we're getting fresh air and exercise but we've all experienced hair twisted in knots from wind, sunburn, heat stroke, frostbite, puncture wounds from walleye, abrasions from pike and ugly wounds from fish hooks and filet knives. Let's not forget near starvation and dehydration from being too busy fishing to properly nourish ourselves.  7. Has your fishing caused trouble at home? Yes, family time is routinely sacrificed for fishing. We try to make up for it by taking the family fishing. Perhaps the saddest commentary is our desire to see every member of our family hooked too.  8. Do you ever try to get extra fishing in on an outing because you do not get enough? Just about every time we fish it happens. We can't stand the kind of angler who wants to quit early. We drop them off and head back out ourselves. No matter the weather or the bite, we scramble to get in those few extra casts or jigs so we can leave the lake with an appropriate level of fulfilment. It never seems to happen. Getting enough is always hard.  9. Do you tell yourself you can stop fishing any time you want to, even though you keep going fishing when you don't mean to? Sure, we'll plan on stopping at a particular time and then the trout start hitting dry flies, or we find a mid-lake hump loaded with walleye, or bass start rising for top water lures or suspended lake trout show up on the Vexilar. If the fish are biting we can't leave. If they aren't biting we have to try every spot and every presentation we can think of to make them bite. Most of us have kidded ourselves into thinking that we fish because we want to, but once we start to fish, we can't stop.  10. Have you missed days of work or school because of fishing? Does a jig and minnow catch walleye? Do brook trout love spinners? Of course! Many of us admit that we have called in sick many times when we were really healthy and fishing.  11. Do you have blackouts? Yes. Hours of fishing euphoria slide into one block of time that slips by imperceptibly and the next thing we know hours or even days are gone.  12. Have you ever felt that your life would be better if you did not fish? Those of us deeply entrenched in angling are so far gone we can't even imagine life without fishing.  So there we have it. Answering yes to four or more of these questions could mean you are a problem angler. However the fundamental question remains, is fishing a serious problem?  Without fishing most of our lives would be impacted by a serious void that might be filled by things much more harmful than fishing. Stuff like television, gambling or even drinking.  If fishing makes us happy, keeps us focused and motivates us to enjoy the outdoors, just how serious of a problem is it? Even if angling can be construed as a bad thing, a person's problems could be much worse. But then again, maybe that's just the fish talking.  Â© 2007 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved"

When i was in high school I convinced a buddy to go for some hard-water speckle action.... we ditched class and headed out only to have our teacher (who was also skipping school) show up and start drilling holes beside us."
107684,stuntman,2007-08-26 04:52:00,96,"When I was 18 or so, with the exception of big rain, I fished EVERYDAY for 8+ hours for a couple of months.  Near the end of those 2 months I was dreaming of working my rod and reel, riding the bus to fishing and riding my bike to fishing.  over and over and over.  It was hell, I decided to cut out fishing cold turkey and my sleep eventually returned.  I am pretty sure a psychiatrist would have either medicated me or told me to stop fishing.  On my deathbed I will still remember fishing myself sick and be somewhat proud of it.  I guess too much of anything is bad.  Stuntman"
106803,highdrifter,2007-08-23 21:23:00,2534,"I full heartedly understand my friend.  The topic of fishing seems to come up all the time, even on first dates.  It's just the facts of life..  Girls understand from the get-go that to love me means to love fishing...  Boner material for me is fast currents, clear water and dancing chrome..   Only time we talk about other stuff is when we're actually out on the water.  Let's get together sometime!  Fishing in the harbor should pick up as the summer progresses..  cheers HD"
