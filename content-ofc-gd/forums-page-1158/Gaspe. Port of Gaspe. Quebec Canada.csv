How is the fishing there? Any one know? What I need? Most of the time I get weeks for plaining but this was out of the blue ""we are going, want to come"" kinda thing.  Was told that fishing is great there... No idea what is there but... ;; need to go out and shop. I guess I will not go on my Saterday Bruse trail hike tomorrow... ah  Please any information will be greatly thanked! Will be seraching for information my self also. any information will be nice!"
107224,Roy,2007-08-24 20:24:00,13728,Any river  flowing into the bay there will hold searun brookies. Simply use light line and worm. Careful of the salmon rivers ...you can't fish there without a specific salmon permit. The harbour itself will be holding lots of mackeral at this time of the year. Spinning gear and silvery spoons is the ticket. Have a great trip.
