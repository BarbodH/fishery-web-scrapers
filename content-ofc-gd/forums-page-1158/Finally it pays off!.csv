106353,fishindevil,2007-08-22 23:07:00,6254,Very impressive muskies !!!!! your hard work payed off big time..  ..way to go man....cheers
106357,Dozer,2007-08-22 23:12:00,896,Nice fish! Congrats!  So is it true that once the fins turn red the fish dies?
106401,Pigeontroller,2007-08-23 01:11:00,2793,"Red and/or bleeding fins are an indication the fish has become stressed and will be tougher to revive/release. This is most common in summer when water temps are high. Its best to keep out of water time to a minimum with stressed fish, better yet a water release with no out of water time! Muskie may look big and mean but they are a very delicate animal, and a valuable resourse, a 20 pound Kawartha Muskie is likely 15 years old, not easily replaced."
106507,2kj,2007-08-23 05:41:00,77,The one fish really looks like a tiger.  Nice fish boys!
106601,Pigeontroller,2007-08-23 13:23:00,2793,"It is an unusal colouration, part barred, part spotted but not a Tiger. If it was a Tiger the tail fins would be rounded like a Pike!"
106900,discophish,2007-08-24 01:22:00,392," Tigers coexist with the purebreds in those waters.  Definitely not a Tiger, their stripes are very prominent and as PT described them, they have a relatively squared tail, unlike the the ""Acura"" Tail of the purebreds.  Would have been my first Tiger ... too bad it wasn't.  Thanks for all the compliments!"

105674,selcram,2007-08-21 02:40:00,26,"Hello!!  My partner, Disco Phish, and I have spent a busy summer testing out new waters!  We've tried Harris Lake, Bynge Inlet, Georgian Bay / Port Severn area, Lake Scugog, Cook's Bay, Manitowabing, Sealey's Bay, Wah Wash kesh Lake, Big Gull Lake, Sand Lake and Lake Rosseau.  Mostly caught smaller pike and some bass.  Tough trying unfamiliar territory... that is until recently, when a spontanious trip landed us three impressive Musky, including my first one ever!  Disco Phish caught the first two while casting the edge of a weedbed on a dropoff,  38"" and 36"" respectively. Beautiful, chunky, healthy fish that were quickly released.  After these we gave an attempt to find some pickerel and tossed into some bays for bass but with no luck so decided to troll again. Good thing we did since not even a minute into it, a 47"" muskie slammed my lure and immediately jumped into the air! With great coaching from Disco Phish and a good friend I was able to bring it in where we took a quick photo ( unfortunately didn't turn out... of course ) and revived it where after about 5 minutes it gave a big thrust and off it went.  Awesome!  Here are some photo's!!               "
105675,TJQ,2007-08-21 02:47:00,7806,"Awesome, congrats.. those are beauties!!"

105705,jediangler,2007-08-21 05:21:00,1923,The smile on your face in that release shot says it all. Congrats.
105710,FishHeadRic,2007-08-21 08:25:00,226,Very Nice! Is that second fish a Tiger? What round about waters were you in?  FHR
105719,Rich Clemens,2007-08-21 10:20:00,3131,High Five's to ya on a successful trip.   Very nice skis .... very nice.
105720,motv8tr,2007-08-21 10:24:00,2587,Very Nice !!!  Maureen
105726,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-21 11:20:00,0,"Nice Musky!!!!I too like exploring new waters. Seeing fresh and different kinds of structure get my adrenalin going.  Gotta love Ontario, there are a lot more lakes to go.  Thanks for posting!!!!"
105728,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 11:34:00,7971,WOW!!! Congratulations on all the muskie and especially your FIRST one!  You two have been working hard all summer long it seems and you finally hit paydirt.  I'm still hoping (but not expecting) for my first one this year...LOL.  Good on you for not giving up and trying new things...it's too easy to fall into that comfy trap of complacency.
105739,derekadam,2007-08-21 12:36:00,22,"Great job on your first musky, proof that persistence does pay off!!!  d"
105740,JFR,2007-08-21 12:37:00,498,"WAy to go, nice fish.    Thanks for sharing your experiences.  John"
105741,Smokey,2007-08-21 12:44:00,1278,Congrats on your success. Good luck on your next outing and keep the reports coming.
105760,camillj,2007-08-21 13:52:00,1988,Great stuff ! Congrats on the 'first' (of many to come) !
105865,Pigeontroller,2007-08-21 19:01:00,2793,"Great report! Thats a nice 47""er for sure. I especially like the release shot! In the future when targeting Muskies please consider using heavier gear, the fight might be more fun on light tackle but Muskie are really suscepible to being over-stressed from a prolonged fight, particularly in summer when the water temperatures are high.  They're chances of survival are much greater when quickly netted and released! Again, congrats on your first Muskie!"
105868,fishnsled,2007-08-21 19:14:00,3520,Great report and congrats!
105916,Rizzo,2007-08-21 21:02:00,4754,"Wow, nicely done! Sounds like a successful summer.   I agree with pigeontroller though.  Now that you've been bitten by the musky bug, go get outfitted so that you can get them in with a little less stress.  I'm not sure if this is true, but I've heard that once the fish is stressed and developes orange tinged fins it likely won't survive.  Lets all do what we can to keep those fish in the drink.  Releasing it is the first step, getting equipment to release it even earlier is a great second step."
105976,selcram,2007-08-21 22:55:00,26,"Thanks everyone for the comments and the suggestions.  We certainly will be investing in heavier gear for future opportunities.   Although we were trying for muskie, being the fish of a ""1000"" casts, never really thought that we would actually hook into some, especially that size. But guess you should always be prepared for the unexpected!!  Be assured that the fish were all brought in relatively quick so as not to increase stress with minimal time out of the water and a long release.  "
105998,Pigeontroller,2007-08-21 23:58:00,2793, I like your attitude!
106028,discophish,2007-08-22 01:42:00,392," What?  You better hold true to those words!  The last time I tried adding to my collection of 8 Fenwicks you broke one of them over my head, and stabbed me with the jagged end.  My head rang for days.  For the next few mornings, I woke up and left for work at places I wasn't even employed!  Excellent!  Le Baron's here we come!  Thanks guys!   <Ahem>.  Who never really thought?  You never listen to me do you?  I told you we would catch some fish that day.  And don't go trying to remember all of those long days we spent fishing in the severe storms, scorching heat, tornados, hurricanes, blizzards, and dangerous freezing temps when I promised you that we would catch fish, but didn't.  That never happened.  Nope.  If in fact it did actually happen, I don't remember."
