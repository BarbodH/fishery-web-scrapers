After having a great time last August fishing Lake Erie with my son and guide Frank Dimarcantonio, my daughter thought she tag along this year as we ventured to Lake Seneca in the Finger Lakes region of New York.  Was only 3 1/2 hours from Toronto and an easy drive.  Started Friday Aug. 17th at 5:30 and went for lake trout initially as the small mouth were off all season. Weather was perfect which meant fish were off.  Did take in five nice lake trout though  Caitlin's first and personal best with Captain Don.    Only small mouth of day one...she's all smiles    Day two - last Saturday - was brutal.  Cold, windy and 2 - 3 foot waves.  Great for fishing!  Another six lakers right off the bat, then drifted for small mount.  26 caught that day in total.      Would definitely go back there again.  Nothing better than a great weekend with the kids.  Robert aka Kansas"
