I recently bought a 16.5 ft fiberglass bowrider and just bought a pair of Scotty downrigger. Will be installing them this week. I'm looking for some help on how to set up my line as I've never down-rigged before. I also bought a couple of rods/reels that should work.  I'm a newbie to this so any info that can be provided would great. Specifically, I'm wondering what type of line is recommended for trolling?  How much lead off the release do I fish - I picked up a few spoons  - any other bait of choice that can be recommended? Any and all other info is welcome.  I plan to head out next week or the week after - hopefully they will be in a litter closer so I do not have to venture out too far. Will post results if and when I get into them.  Thanks a million - Remo"
