107471,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-25 12:19:00,0,"I know when I used to have a payroll that vacation pay was 4% ( on top of 11% workman's comp, half of pention and half of unemployment ) which equals to 2 weeks. I remember working for a company that paid it to us in every check, naturally this was seasonal work but you can see the added 4% on every paycheck.  I'm sure it's still that.  Now working seasonal jobs from when I was 16 and then been self employed the last 20+ years I never had a real holiday until 3 years ago and I now take holidays every year. I took 2 weeks this year and will keep doing so. Before I would come home on Thursday night and tell the better half that were going to the trailer ( in-Laws ) for the week. But naturally half the time would be spent coming back into town to work.  Self employment has it's perks but naturally no benefits or paid vacations are the down side."

Full time student/part time at work, ive been at the same job for almost three years and have never had an issue with booking any time off that I want. So far this summer ive booked probably two weeks worth of fishing time with no issue whatsoever.  Now when i get a fulltime job this will all cahnge..."
107593,aplumma,2007-08-25 21:56:00,6896,If a company is not going to take care of the mental health (vacations) of their employees willingly why would you want to work for them? To have the goverment require them to do the right thing is to invite more goverment into your life.    Art
107680,bigfish1965,2007-08-26 03:43:00,3382,My employer is very fair and goes out of their way for me.  Man I have got to start using a more anonymous handle here. 
107714,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-26 12:36:00,0," My beef is that you keep complaining that the government shouldn't get involved in this and that. Example.Should not make mandatory safety laws.  I personally have some beefs with the way our government runs things and coruption but I dont have the same beefs with our government as you have. Basically you want anarchy more or less. You want them to make YOU do whatever you want and life is just not like that. Thats why governments were formed in the first place.  You stated the government shouldn't get involved and be responsible for things like vacation pay and benefits. The problem is that they are not involved enough! Why do you think UNIONS came about? To make sure people get what they deserve(at least that was the Idea). If the government was doing what they were supposed to, their wouldn't be Unions.  You have the sentimentality of a Southerner(No offence). I find it hard to believe you are Canadian. Canadians are all about helping out the less fortunate. Yes with our taxes. My problem is we dont know where those taxes go for the most part. Much is being rerouted...  Aplumma...if the government gets involved in my life and gets me the benefits and vacation pay I deserve, they are welcome in my life."
107721,OhioFisherman,2007-08-26 13:04:00,6623,"Lew that was a great set up with the overtime, I usually worked 500 to 1000 hours overtime a year, most of it forced overtime. It was paid at time and one half, but given a choice of extra time off to compensate would have been nice, most weeks I was at 45 to 48 hours after 4 days, give me the 3 day weekends. Firemen here in the cities and towns that have full-time firemen seem to work 24 hours at the station, then off 48 hours.  My neighbor teaches Cad/Cam at the county vocational school, he gets the summers off, LOL and doesn`t fish. All kinds of ways for him to pick up extra cash, teaching nite classes, designing homes, making blueprints."
107728,aplumma,2007-08-26 13:51:00,6896,Johhny Bass  to clear up my muddled statement actually my point was with all of the good companys out their that willingly want to make the employees happy and well rested. To work for a company that has to be forced to do the right thing is not a good company to work for. That type of company will do only the least amount needed to satisfy the regulation rather than the employee.   Art
107738,bigfish1965,2007-08-26 14:39:00,3382,"Vacation pay is paid by the employer, not from taxes or withouldments from pay. If you are salary it is part of your salary package. The current law says the employer must give the equivalent of two weeks paid time off after one year of employment. The employer must also give 10 days off (paid or unpaid at the discretion of the employer) for such things as sickness, sickness of a child or spouse etc. There is also a provision for the caretaker of a terminally ill parent or child and time off for the that. We also have parental leave allowing one parent or both a cumulative total of one year off (receiving UI benefits) to care for a newborn of newly adopted child with their jobs secured upon return."
107740,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-26 14:57:00,0,"  I understand though my point is that those companies are getting scarcer, every one wants to get rich over night....They dont care about the health of their employees. They care about the buck.  Many companies are only hiring part time...  So when no company wants to give their employees benefits or vacation pay, then what?  Least amount is better than no amount. Then its up to the discretion of your employer if he wants to give more. If they really care like you say, they shouldn't have a problem giving you more.  Good jobs are scarce up here unless you want to work shift work or have a field of expertise.  I guess the easy answer is to go back to school, learn a trade and have no social life for a few years........."
107049,pigeonfisher,2007-08-24 14:49:00,696,"Are we not all employees?  Regardless of who's signature is on the bottom of your cheques it is our customers who pay our bills.  If we are capable of setting up an organization that can properly service our customers and allow certain luxuries (ie. company cars, vacation time, bonuses, increased wages and/or perforormance based bonuses) to the employees that we work with on a daily basis then we have succeeded.  As the captain of the ship you work for your employees and your customers, your employees make certain sacrifices for the benefit of the companies overall good.  GREAT leaders and entrepeneurs generally understand that satisfied employees make for a succesful company, they also understand that they themselves are not the reason a company succeeds or fails but merely a facilitator in the growth of it's people."

107374,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-25 02:28:00,0, Exactly. Why do we elect these people if not to make a better life for all of us? It should be a right AND law that people are given health benefits and vacation pay. Other than Canadian guy... I dont think anyone can argue with that.
107376,Daplumma,2007-08-25 02:31:00,1961,"My first real job I got 30 days vacation,not bad for an 18 year old.Had full medical and dental and tons of travel.Spent two years in Bermuda!That was the Navy.Now I haven't had a paid vacation for 17 years....go figure. Joe"
107388,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-25 02:50:00,2585,could be worse!!!!!!!  we could be in the canadian forces fighting with inadequte equipment and half assed armoured vehicles with the high chance of death everyday.  Im greatful for every day i spend with my family.  i work long hours and do 60 to 70 thousand km a year travelling around the province away from them.  But at least i dont have to worry about roadside bombs or bullets flying by my head everyday.  (unless im in scarlem)  When you think you got it bad remember those who have it worse.  Cheers!
107453,canadianguy33,2007-08-25 07:20:00,121," Well, someone already pointed out that vacation pay still is mandatory in Ontario.   I wouldn't know because I've been self employed for years and I don't have employees so correct me if I'm wrong.  Also, we do have universal health care, so what's your beef?  From what I understand, vacation pay isn't paid by my taxes.  Rather it is in fact part of your pay that is deducted from your paycheck.  I do disagree with the government forcing anyone to forfeit part of their earnings to participate in a mandatory vacation program, but that's really really low on my list of grievances with our current government.  If I were forced to pay taxes so everyone had paid vacations you're damn right I'd argue against that.  If you don't like the way you're compensated at your job then go out and get a new one.  Stop passing the buck and man up.  I did."
106431,Rattletrap2,2007-08-23 01:46:00,1652,"The best I have heard of in a while, is a company from the US that I do business with. They only give 3 weeks vacation to everyone, but every 4 years, you must take three consecutive weeks off with pay. You are also allowed to tack on up to 2 weeks from your vacation that year! Can you imagine the whole month of July off??? WOW!  I think this is a great idea to encourage people to stay with the company. I also like the idea of an extended vacation every now and again. BTW, I've never had more than 2 weeks off at a time... and that was only once."
106456,Hooked,2007-08-23 02:32:00,891,"  Thanks Dan.  I am fortunate enough to work at a place that started me at 3 wks.  Actually, one year I got almost 6 wks paid off, but I wasn't complaining,    ....now I got 4, been there 8 years. Let me tell you, Italy is the place to be, naps are normal and the day doesn't start till 10 or 11 pm, now thats life."
106602,tonyb,2007-08-23 13:25:00,1637,"Indeed, it seems we are all chasing the mighty dollar.  Work-life balance is a whole new topic, I read a book recently and it had a link to their website, that's where I got those stats.  I don't have children and it is hard enough juggling work/wife/fishing, I don't know how people manage to stay sane with kids added to the mix.  Based on two weeks holidays, you spend more time in the bathroom over the year, than on vacation.  How sick is that? lol  Tony"
106608,BITEME,2007-08-23 13:48:00,1969,I have no complaints life works out just fine for me  WORK EAT SLEEP &HIT DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN  NO PROBLEM!!!!!
106610,OhioFisherman,2007-08-23 13:50:00,6623,"It seems most companies down here don`t want you to stay, longer term employees make more, more vacation time, they think it`s cheaper to get new help.  One of the trucking companies I worked for hired a leasing division, run by a family member of the owner to do our work. The drivers had to buy their own truck(tractor), were called sub-contractors not employees, no benefits except what they personally paid. They have to pay their own social security taxes and supply their own tractor insurance. pay their own workers comp.  If they get tied up at a companies dock, in traffic, they sit for free, such a deal, and they make about 5 bucks less an hour. Safety inspections? your truck, you want to make money or tie your truck up for repairs?"
106638,misfish,2007-08-23 14:34:00,29133,"It has taken me from 1985 til now,to get close to what I was making back then.  Johns right,it,s hard these days to find a company that pays benifits and a decent wage.  Back in 85 I worked for Burlington Carpets in Brampton. I was making $19.50 hr plus bonus.The bonus was making over your quota. I always had a good partner there.REAL WORKERS. Our quota was 85 bails of carpet fibre in an 8 hour shift,we would bust our butts and put out anywheres from 115-140. Depending on break downs. If the machine was down for a day,we got paid an average wage.This would work out at times at 22-26 dollars an hour.Good money back in those days for a guy with no real education,but these days,good luck.I had to do school,n and all that to get back to those wages these days.  Holidays I get 4 weeks plus 8 sick days,plus 5 occasionial days. Not bad for your average joe.  Added bonus here,if I know I want a day off,I can make it up before and not lose a holiday."
106699,caper,2007-08-23 17:43:00,210,I consider myself very lucky when it comes to time off. I work shift work which sucks sometimes when you miss out on family functions and holiday times like Christmas but I certainly make up for it in other time off. I get 5 weeks vacation after being there 16 years but with banked time and the shift work it combines to a lot more. I just went back to work Monday after having 32 straight days off and I tell you it sure was nice and refreshing to have all that time off in a row. And I still have more time off in the fall for hunting. I feel for those who only get like two or three weeks of in a year. We all should have more time off work as I think it refreshes you.  Fourteen more years and I'll have Lew's shedule!!
106701,Headhunter,2007-08-23 17:47:00,5703,"I've already had my one week off this year! LOL May get a couple more days here and there before the new year! Actually, I have not had two consecutive weeks off in 18 years! Just can't afford that much time away from business. HH"
