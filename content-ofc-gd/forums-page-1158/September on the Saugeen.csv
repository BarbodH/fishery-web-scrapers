107026,Sandy Scanoe,2007-08-24 14:10:00,5,"Having survived two months of ""home renovation hell"", in triple digit US Midwestern heat, we're ready to head North and chill-out.  We're pulling our little trailer up to the vicinity of Hanover in a couple of weeks to visit with an old friend who has a place up there near the Saugeen River. ( Which Saugeen River? At this point, we don't have a clue. )  When we checked online, we were very pleasantly surprised at the number of fishing opportunities available in the area. This does, however, complicate our packing. My wife & I have done float trips in canoes on the Ozark streams for decades. ( thanks to our Coleman back-supports ) Our spinning tackle ranges from ultra-light up to light Salt Water.  In the gin-clear upper river & spring branches, for Trout, we can go down to 3/4 lb. test sewing thread, 1/32 oz. jigs, and 4.5 - 5 ft. rods. Are any of the creeks and upper reaches of the Saugeen and associated streams so clear that we'd need it?  Standard equipment for Ozark Smallmouth & panfish is a 5 1/2 ft. rod & 4 lb. line. Would that be enough for the upper Saugeen or would 6 1/2 ft. with 6 lb. line be prudent?  In the larger portions of the Saugeen, should we bulk up to heavier rods and 8 lb. line for Smallmouth with a thin wire leader for spoons or spinners that might attract Pike?  Near the river mouth, or on docks or jettys, 7 ft. medium rods with 10 lb. Power-Pro are in the arsenal. Is that about right? Or should we bring the two-handed 8 footers and reels to match? ( Are Steelhead & Salmon possible that early? )  The one thing we don't plan to use is bait. It's just a hassle to find it, buy or catch it, and then either keep it alive or put up with the stench until you can actually go fishing with it.  ( Any Trout that eats a piece of ""floating garlic cheese-bait"" deserves to die. )  Any suggestions on lures, tactics, or strategies for fishing that area will certainly be appreciated.  Thanks for your time and attention."

107056,Raf,2007-08-24 15:06:00,3495,"Saugeen smallies can be a bit bigger.. I would use at least a 6.5"" and 6 or 8lb mono.  Wire leaders are an idea as there is a population (depending where you are) of pike and muskie in the river.  As Lexx stated the water is usually stained althoguh I've not fished the extreme upper portion of the river."
107075,lew,2007-08-24 15:27:00,12767,"I've never fished the Saugeen, so unfortunately I can't be on any assistance to you, but I did win this snazzy T-shirt in a contest one night.  You'll just hafta ignore that strange lookin person standing beside me though  "
107115,JFR,2007-08-24 16:44:00,498,"It has been a number of years since my wife and I canoed the Saugeen River.  I know it is a beautiful river to spend a day or several.  Fishing is quite good.  A few miles away in Walkerton, at the fishway, there is good fishing for migratory salmon, steelhead.  You may want to consider bringing or buying a 9ft rod with 8# test mono.  The bait of choice would be roe bags and flies, small spinners and spoons.  I know there was a stocking program for brown trout a few years ago, but I don't know the outcome.  If they were sucessful there should be some very large resident browns.  Here is a site that I just found for you  http://www.canadianangling.com/news.php  I believe this site is based upon the Saugeen watershed.  You could contact Grant Ferris at this web page http://www.greybruceoutdoors.com/, I know in the past Grant has been more than helpful to visitors to the Saugeen.  Good luck and enjoy your stay.

107365,Sandy Scanoe,2007-08-25 02:11:00,5,"Thanks to all for the prompt responses.  We'll skip the Ultra-Light tackle this time.  Is there any particular reason that 8 lb. mono is used on long rods pitching row-bags, spinners &  spoons to Steelhead & Salmon? With so much bend in the rod, and so much stretch in the line, isn't it hard to keep ""in touch"" with the baits, much less set a hook?  It would seem that a thin, low-stretch, length of 10 lb. Power-Pro type line would work.  It's stronger when wet, resists abrasion, and casts farther than mono; all reasons why the Inshore saltwater guys use it a lot. Yes, you will need to change knots, or learn new ones, and it's so very limp that ""air-knots"" do happen. ( They're a hassle to work-out, especially in a breeze, or sitting in a canoe headed downstream. )  In an earlier post about Salmon, someone suggested a circle-hook, a yellow or white foam ear-plug, and a couple split-shot as a viable rig fishing from shore. If so, how much distance should we put between the weight and the hook? Should the rig hold bottom, or be just enough to sink it? With this approach, if they're running, we'll almost certainly take a shot at the migrating Hunonauts. Hard to beat a no-muss, no-fuss, approach.  As it turns out, some of the lures mentioned elsewhere on this board are already in our tackle box. We have several J-13 Rapala's, in Blue, Black, & Firetiger and a bunch of Daredevle and Little Cleo spoons, plus a palatte of spinners.  We'll probably pack a selection of hair & maribou jigs, with a side-order of plastic grubs.  Maybe a few top-waters as well, just for grins.  One thing we might attempt on our trip is a fish-off between a ""vintage"" rod & reel and a ""modern"" pair. We have a 45 year old St Croix 6 1/2 ft. rod and a matching Mitchell 300 reel that we've used since they were new. The plan is to compare them to a significantly lighter Okuma rod & reel that we recently purchased. ( same length and line capacities ) Will the old fiberglass hold up? Can that primitive 2-disk drag handle a long run? Stay tuned.  Have a great weekend."
107375,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-25 02:30:00,2585,the smallies are strong!!!!  they can get to be 4 or 5 pounds but the 2 pounders fight like 4 pounders!  Good luck!  Cheers!
