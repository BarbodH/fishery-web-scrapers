One thing I can tell you for sure 100% guaranteed is "" you can't catch fish from the couch"".  I'm sure wind direction/weather have their effects on fish but if you get bad conditions for a week or two are all the fish in the lake going to starve?  I've caught a lot of big big fish on east wind days as well as 6 fish days so it can't be that bad.  The picture in my profile is actually an east wind fish and it also was -5C that day. Brrrrrrr"

I've seen some of my best days fishing an east wind and some worst days fishing a west wind.  The area that I fish for salmon from shore works with a wind that blows up big waves."
