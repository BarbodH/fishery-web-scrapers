107372,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 02:25:00,3421, Nope haven't touched the 12 foot tinny since I got back my sturdy Lund is much more safer for my Lard ass .  Just to make it clear my PFD held my ass afloat not the Ukranian scouts.  Ah Glen your always good for a great laugh and a chuckle  Now book that flight for November in Quinte and you can put a real big hog picture in your Avatar.  Oh and my cousin Percher can lend you a survival suit to keep your southern hide warm.  Hope to see ya in the BOQ.  Mike

107426,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-25 03:43:00,2585,nice report!  Good info on the trailer!  CHeers!
107442,John Bacon,2007-08-25 04:38:00,3277,"  Should that read ""if your boat is over 2,000 lbs?  Was that $55 for all four gliders?  I am planning to put new bunks on my trailer this year and would prefer the gliders to carpet."

107473,ccmtcanada,2007-08-25 12:23:00,7971,"Nice job out there Glen...always nice when you can get out and fish!  Bly is picking up our oldest from Michigan this weekend, so we'll be able to take the canoe out more often, now that our babysitter is back at home...LOL.  Nice fish and pics...oh yeah...it'll still be nice and warm here in November...hoping to make it to BOQ this year...just have to beg for a few spots in a boat, since I'm not keen on taking the canoe out there...haha."
107524,SlowPoke,2007-08-25 16:50:00,2984, Ouch! LOL!!! Good report Glen. Were those the minnows you smuggled home from Lakair? Where can I get some of those fancy glides for my roller trailer? -Brian
107563,Sinker,2007-08-25 19:51:00,8692,"Those gliders look interesting.  Are they that slick, that when you lanch, you risk your boat  sliding off the trailer on the way in.....if its all unhooked? Sure look good for putting it back on, but when I launch I like to unhook everything before and let the boat glide off the trailer........just how slippery are they?  Thanks for the report, Sinker"

107622,Clampet,2007-08-25 23:00:00,1947,Good to see yer mug again!  
107623,Sinker,2007-08-25 23:01:00,8692,"  LOL....thanks for the reply....and the laugh!!  I think I can handle not unhooking the boat if it makes it that much easier to get back on again. I need to replace my winch as it is, from wrassling the boat back on. Either that, or get a drive on trailer......  Sinker"
