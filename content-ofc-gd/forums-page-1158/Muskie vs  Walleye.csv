107578,fishindevil,2007-08-25 20:48:00,6254,"Yes dont you hate it when that happens !!!!!! that sucks cause your walleye,is now all mangled up  ,and dam !! you lost that big muskie....   oh well it could have been worse,you might have not caught anything,at lesat you fought that big boy for 15mins and gave you a good work out.  ..cheers"
107596,fatherof3,2007-08-25 22:01:00,1769,sad looking walleye.Too bad the muskie would not cooperate
107601,Muskieman,2007-08-25 22:10:00,2472,"Sad for sure , he was part of my limit of four"
107606,Dozer,2007-08-25 22:32:00,896,"Ahhhhhh, very nice!  Too bad about the 'ski."
107614,tbayboy,2007-08-25 22:45:00,1497,May not be much of a dinner 'eye but a hell of a story.  I'd say that's a fair trade.
