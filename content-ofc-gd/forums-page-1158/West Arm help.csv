107223,redfin,2007-08-24 20:24:00,79,"My family and I were fishing the West Arm (Musky Island) last week but failed to catch a musky.  This is the first time in a few years that we have not a musky for the camera in the area...it was not for the lack of trying…we trolled and cast all week.  The only “could have been”  a musky was when I was flipping for bass with my son along the shoreline over some submerge timbers, a fish hit my flipping jig, I set the hook, felt the head shake then it clean cut my 50# pp…could have been a Northern  We found some smaller walleye near the rivermouth east of Musky Isle over 15-18 fow and caught quite a few 12-14” fish.  They were tight on the bottom, and hit the worm harness like the perch.  We also hooked a few slot eyes throwing spinnerbait where we normally find the smallies over some rock and weeds.  Good luck and have fun.  Report here... http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=10438"
