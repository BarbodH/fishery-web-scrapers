107565,Sinker,2007-08-25 19:56:00,8692,"I wouldn't get my hopes up about anything the ""Ministry of NO RESULTS"" says......."
107641,jedimaster,2007-08-26 00:09:00,3472,"A few things to ponder, 1)No Columnaris was found in Scugog dead carp. This was in the paper as released by the MNR. 2)That bacteria affects more justcarp so other species would have died 3) This was not the result of spawning stress of poulation as the spawn was well over when the dead ones showed up in the other lakes. 4) Carp Suck 5) The MNR Lies all the timeso why would anyone even believe that they even ran any tests, let alone release the actual results. They don't have enough money to drive the carp to the testing facility I am so sure they would have enough money to run a bunch of expensive tests.  It was obviously some carp related disease. Was it put in by the MnR? I doubt it. They just don't care and they know that 95 percent of the population doesn't give a carp about carp.  My only concern is they they were soo fast to say the water was safe for normal use before they even had any wif of what could have been wrong. This fact was very disturbing to me."
107671,Sinker,2007-08-26 02:43:00,8692," The only reason they would have results so soon on water, is they can get the results within a day or two.  In order to culture bacteria.......it takes time......and lots of different tests......more time.....different temps......different moisture content.....many variables......lots of time is the bottome line.  I honestly don't think the MNR know what happened. I know some people who would have gotten results firsthand from the MNR, and they know as much as all of us do.  Whatever it was, it hasn't effected any other fish populations as far as I can see. This summer has been a great one for walleyes and musky on all the infected lakes that I've fished......so really.....its not hurting anyone/thing. The carp needed to be thinned out a bit, and there's still lots of them around.....I see them all the time.  Sinker"
107201,Beans,2007-08-24 19:29:00,3339,At the meeting held in Little Britain on Wednesday the MNR spokesman said that the bacterium flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris which in turn killed off the carp...  What a load of crap!...if this was the cause why didn't it kill off other species? Are we to believe that the bacteria mutated into a form that became carp specific?  I think not but that's their story and we are stuck with it...
107202,Squid,2007-08-24 19:32:00,1656,I am sure that the MNR had something to do with the die off and are loathe to admit it.
107205,Roy,2007-08-24 19:38:00,13728,"If you research the bacteria, you'll know that it couldn't have been that. At least there would have been as many dead catfish."
107206,Beans,2007-08-24 19:41:00,3339,They claim they didn't put anything into the water...SURE !!!  Evidently the meeting became quite heated...  Too bad I can't attend the next meeting in Bobcaygeon next Wednesday at 07:00 pm...(wife's birthday)
107207,Beans,2007-08-24 19:42:00,3339,
107209,redx,2007-08-24 19:43:00,60,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnaris  Not just carp, catfish but most all types. ;; I hope this does not spread."
107211,Roy,2007-08-24 19:44:00,13728,Maribeth has TWO birthdays???
107212,Beans,2007-08-24 19:47:00,3339,Yep...but we don't usually mention the other one except to close friends...LOL  (more of an anniversary)
107214,jedimaster,2007-08-24 19:55:00,3472,They are liars. They said previously that no columnaris was found in Scugog. WHat a load of crap. They ether know and aren't telling or just don't give enough of a poop to actually find out.
107216,Beans,2007-08-24 20:02:00,3339,Columnaris is in all the waters of the Kawarthas and has been for ages but it only attacks weakened or wounded fish and has no favorites...
107258,Riparian,2007-08-24 21:44:00,269,So... let me get this straight. There are accusations of the MNR putting something into the water with the intention of deliberatly killing carp?
107274,Big Cliff,2007-08-24 22:12:00,6899,"No, they didn't put something in the water to kill the carp, my understanding is that they put something in the water to try to control the weeds but what ever it was killed the carp. As for some sort of a ""conspiracy""...... it wouldn't be the first time we've been blatently lied too!  I do not believe what the MNR are telling us, it just doesn't add up even with basic math. What ever happened to ""accountability""? Oh, I remember if you are in government there isn't any!"
107279,redx,2007-08-24 22:21:00,60," That would make more sense since then Carp will be only affected since them being bottom feeders who happens to feed off plants also. But if that is the case you can just find the areas that had weed controlled and see if that areas had the same carp kills... And if the carp died due to feeding off it I'm sure the toxic report would of found it? <do they have that for fish?>  The carp kills where too isolated. It's can't be any sort of pollution, or bacteria. No idea what happened but I'm sure that it will happen again if it was natural."
107285,danbouck,2007-08-24 22:25:00,4380,Any chance that it was a test for killing off the asian carp?
107302,jedimaster,2007-08-24 23:03:00,3472, If it was that they would have done it in a secret lab somewhere for millions of dollars.
107353,ccmtcanada,2007-08-25 01:39:00,7971,Jedi was right....they did find columnaris in carp...but not in ANY Scugog carp.  They found it in the lakes that followed.  Something isn't right and smells fishy....pun intended.
107358,Greencoachdog,2007-08-25 01:50:00,8163,I personally think it was the work of anti-carp terrorists... Roy?
107360,redx,2007-08-25 01:54:00,60," They could of killed the lamperay eels, called them and tell them to reconsider their terrorist ways to another."
107386,stuntman,2007-08-25 02:49:00,96,This stuff was found in other lakes but not Scugog?  The Scugog kill was Carp only? It sounds more likely that the Carp ate something that other fish stayed away from. Carp are not particularily weak fish are they?   I think a Freedom of Information Act request is $5.  Has anyone done one before?  If someone goes to a meeting ask what tests were done and post them here.  With the knowledge of what to ask for the documents can be asked for/obtained.  Then again I am certain that there is some newspaper reported is all over this story.  Is there?  Stuntman
107387,bigfish1965,2007-08-25 02:50:00,3382,"I don't find it hard to believe since the die off occured right after/during spawn when the carp would be heavily congregated and more apt to spread the virus. Younger fish would have not been as exposed to it and less likely to cross-contaminate. Catfish would not have been around the same areas either. The virus is naturally occurring and, like other viruses like the common cold, is only an issue when populations get condensed for short periods of time."
107412,Riparian,2007-08-25 03:15:00,269,I will agree with the above.
107465,Handlebarz,2007-08-25 11:23:00,3790,For all the good the MNR does that we dont see I find it hard to beleive they would do this unless there is a major problem they are tryingto help control.  Maybe they gave all the musky drum gobies VHS
107500,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-25 14:52:00,698,Aren't carp bad for a Lakes eco-system? My understanding is they have very aggressive spawning habits and tend to destroy habitat that other fish use. Judging by the size and quantity of them don't they count as an invasive species or is it just asian carp that cause these issues?
107506,Roy,2007-08-25 16:07:00,13728,"The term ""invasive species' is given to a fish/animal that has yet no dollar value on the commercial or recreational market. Find a niche for them either comestible or sport (crossbow) and they'll be welcomed with open arms. Sorry, that's how I feel today. As long as someone is making money....."
107557,Canuck2fan,2007-08-25 19:41:00,1444,"I realize I am in the minority here but the fish that died are just ""carp"" so what is the problem? As a species they are not especially vital or hard to replace as far I know. I don't see why anyone would care too much except for the smell and the cost of the cleanup. That might be because I have lost a couple of really great fishing spots to idiots who thought putting a few dozen carp would improve things.....  My opinion aside though the MNR should totally forth coming and not lie to the people who employ them meaning all of us taxpayers."
