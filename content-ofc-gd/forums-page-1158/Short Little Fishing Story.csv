106880,canadianguy33,2007-08-24 00:24:00,121,"I was reading Anatz's post about his fishing addiction and it reminded me of a funny story that happened when I was a young pup like him.  When I was 17 I had a girl friend who I kind of liked, but not really in girlfriend/boyfriend kind of way.  I knew she had a crush on me and it felt good having her around to stroke my male ego, but I just knew I'd probably never go out with her even though she was quite a looker.  Anyways, one day I invited her to come fishing with me under the bridge at Squirrel Creek on the Otonabee River.  She was excited by my invitation so off we went for a fish.  When we got to Squirrel Creek, we parked the car and headed down below bridge and began fishing.  Not five minutes after our lines hit the water, a group of burley tattooed bikers pulled over on the bridge above us.  We could hear the macho bikers contemplating jumping off the bridge and their conversation went something like:  Biker 1: ""Your brother really jumps off this bridge?"" Biker 2: ""yea, he does it all the time"" Biker 1: ""man, that's a long way down.  Is it deep enough?"" Biker 2  ""I think so.  I don't know dude, we're pretty high up."" Biker 1: ""do you think there's any rocks?"" Biker 2: ""could be...I'm not sure if this is a good idea""  Anyways, the bikers carried on for about 15 minutes, talking about jumping off the bridge, and it was pretty clear that none of them wanted to jump.  After listening to these wimpy bikers, me and my big mouth started making jokes about them to my girl 'friend' about how the bikers were chickenshats.  Eventually, my girl 'friend' remarked, ""if you're such a big man, why don't you go show them how it's done?"" in a joking tone.  Well, I wasn't about to forfeit my manly image to a girl that I kind of liked but didn't think I'd go out with so without even thinking I stripped down to my underwear and ran up the hill to the bridge.  When I got to the top of the bridge, I started walking towards the middle and bikers took notice and stared at me down as I walked towards them.  When I finally approached them, I said to them in a cocky tone: ""my girlfriend is tired of hearing all your whining and whining about jumping off the bridge, and she suggested I show you guys some real balls.""  Before, the bikers even had a chance to respond I climbed up on the rail and jumped into the water.  Unfortunately, I didn't take enough time to prepare my jump and I ended up hitting the water in a weird way.  When I hit the water I knocked the wind out of myself a little bit and twisted my back in a weird way.  To everyone observing my jump I'm sure I looked fine, but as I swam towards shore I could hardly catch my breath and I knew I'd twisted my back, but I didn't want my girl 'friend' to know it and think I was a pussy.  I mean, I was hurting in a bad way...my back was focked, but there was no way in hell I was going to let my girl 'friend' or the bikers see an ounce of pain.  Anyways, after we were done fishing we went for ice cream and played  the most excruciating round of mini-golf at Milltown Golfland.  To this day, I've never told my girl 'friend' (who I'm still friends with) the truth about that story.   Well, that might not be the greatest story but I'm always up for hearing a good fishing story so post'em if you have'em."

107007,tonyb,2007-08-24 12:48:00,1637,"Funny story, thanks for sharing.  It's amazing no matter how much we evolve, we still have those caveman tendencies swimming around in our subconcious"
107018,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-24 13:39:00,698,"What take more balls, jumping off a cliff or telling off a group of bikers?"
107035,pigeonfisher,2007-08-24 14:22:00,696,"I think the government should outlaw bridge jumping when it's being done to stroke an ego.  Certainly they should create a by law stating that ""Those jumping from bridges in an effort to ""get some"" or ""harm ones self"" must wear a Coast Guard Approved PFD to help in recovery of said person""  Just bustin' your nuts, Jay."
107135,canadianguy33,2007-08-24 17:19:00,121,"lol you guys are too funny.   Damn, I never thought about that.  I should have married her just to make the story better.  For those that were wondering, I was a hurtin' unit for about a week after the jump.  I told my buddy about what had happened at school the next morning, and he couldn't help but tell my big mouth english teacher (a really funny guy) who razzed me about it in class for a couple of weeks.  Also, I was really hoping one of you guys would chime in with a good story."
