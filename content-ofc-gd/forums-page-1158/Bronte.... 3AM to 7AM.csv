106666,HIMTI,2007-08-23 16:24:00,33,After reading the post that Salmon were caught off Bronte harbor. I decided to give it a shot. Threw Little Cleos for 4 hours and nothing. there were about 8-10 fishermen there and no one had anything. Sad starting to the day today.
106671,ccmtcanada,2007-08-23 16:34:00,7971,At least you got out there and gave it a try.  You cant catch anything from your living room!
106672,fatherof3,2007-08-23 16:35:00,1769,"it is hit or miss right now but rain will help, just keep at it"
106685,Canuck2fan,2007-08-23 17:01:00,1444,Sorry you got skunked.... I worked at my part time job from 3 till 8 AM before I went to the regular job (which only took me 45 minutes today I love being on salary) and I am betting you still had the better time LOL.  The rain will definitely help and so will the cooler temps coming next week along with the full moon ;o)
106692,Mike Pike,2007-08-23 17:14:00,1332,"That's pier fishing.  Only way to increase your odds of hookin' into a fish is by heading out more often.  Also, the salmon are just starting to gather at the river mouths so be patient and keep fishing.  Oh, and thanks for your report, by the way!"
106694,dobee,2007-08-23 17:17:00,301,"I also went down, 10pm until 1 am.... saw 2 hooked but nothing brought in, and I lost 4 cleos. >:|  slow night"
106698,Uncle Buck,2007-08-23 17:37:00,1000,"Whitefox and I tried the liftbridge last night... nothing hooked/landed/sighted/zip/zilch/nada  again, it's still early the odd fish is in here and there, but it still needs more time"
106706,ccmtcanada,2007-08-23 17:55:00,7971,"I was out trying as well, in my neck of the woods.  Nothing came out of the water here either!"
106712,tonyb,2007-08-23 18:33:00,1637,"Yep, hit or miss as fatherof3 and MTP say, you just gotta be persistant.  Some years I have gone 3 or 4 trips getting skunked, but then get nights that you get 5 or 6 fish, it's all timing, and nobody can say for sure when a good time to go is.  You can't catch 'em when you're logged into OFC though, so get out there! (well maybe if you have a cell phone with internet or similar device! )  Tony"
106727,Disspatcher,2007-08-23 19:22:00,73,"If you watch the trollers threads, they are little confused too,.....only getting the salmon and bows out in 300 FOW still!!!!! The rain this weekend should bring them in a wee bit closer!!"
106737,lazybum,2007-08-23 19:34:00,142,Surface temperatures in western Lake Ontario seems high at the moment.  We had east winds for a few days that moved a lot of warm water in.  Wait for the north or north-west winds to pick up to push it back out.  Lake Ont Temps
106763,mikeymikey,2007-08-23 20:17:00,376,"Oh wow,,, 8 ~ 10 fishermen that early in the morning of a weekday... that is hardcore."
106765,tonyb,2007-08-23 20:19:00,1637,The Internet is an amazing tool
106770,Fishnfiend,2007-08-23 20:29:00,357,"The Bronte fish are partial to chicken wing remnants from the firehall.  I suggest going for some wings and a bevvie at the Firehall, then going down to the pier.  You are probably laughing, but it has worked in the past..."
106842,addict,2007-08-23 22:59:00,475,i tossed a few casts today with the spoons gave up after an hour but ill be back its still early.
106846,misfish,2007-08-23 23:07:00,29133,"Damn them spoons.LOL  I like to read about the guys fishing from the rocks/piers from down at Lake Ontario way. I really enjoyed my times down there chucking the Cleo and Croc.Met alot of good people there.  Keep at it,they will bite, and you will be rewarded."
106885,Mike Pike,2007-08-24 00:37:00,1332,"Yup, that's the pattern.  I wish you hadn't have posted it Fishnfiend.  Now everyone's gonna know about it.  lol"
106934,Fishnfiend,2007-08-24 02:24:00,357,"Sorry Mike (hiccup), I don't know what I was thinking..."
106980,SlowPoke,2007-08-24 08:48:00,2984,dang' perfect. Not only are glow-in-the-dark Cleo's sold out but now you can't find a chicken wing within a 40km radius of Bronte. Way to go guys. -Brian
106992,lilkynan,2007-08-24 12:03:00,173,Head out to the lift bridge on the Hamilton side and cast glow in the dark cleos right where the break wall starts. Always got them there first before the pier at Bronte
107001,tonyb,2007-08-24 12:39:00,1637,Interesting...I have found Bronte to be hot earlier than the shipping canal.  Might have to spend some time there!  Tony
107087,henryko,2007-08-24 15:39:00,41," Under the bridge, eh? I will give that a try sometimes too!"
107552,BillyBarilko,2007-08-25 19:24:00,28,"I was out this morning in anywhere from 40-130 feet, lots marked from 45 out to 110 by the ship canal.  Managed one 15 lber only out for a few hours. Boats were all in close, almost within casting distance Lots jumping too, I'd say casting from the ship canal in the next few days esp after these rains should yield some, good luck!  It's been a crazy summer trolling, spring was good, then fish were out way deep most of last July and Aug, might have some good later runs too. Fish I got today was still very silver."
