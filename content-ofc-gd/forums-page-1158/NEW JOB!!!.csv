107628,Clampet,2007-08-25 23:20:00,1947,"Congrats! Landing a new job is an achievent. You went from unemployed to employed.  For some, that step becomes next to unattainable.  Getting the job is step one. Step two is making the grade, usually in the form of a 'probation' period. Step three is keeping the job.  Sometimes our skills aren't enough, we are also required to put up with unfair situations in the workplace, as well as abusive bosses.  I hope you make it through, and succeed.  Then you can concentrate on what's really important, like family and friends, dogs, cats....  "
