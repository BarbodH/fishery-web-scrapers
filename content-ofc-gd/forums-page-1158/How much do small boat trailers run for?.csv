I'd like to get a boat trailer for it to make use of it in the summer.  I haven't seen many trailers come up for sale these days, but i've been keeping my eyes open.  How much do you figure a trailer for this boat would run me?"

107396,SlowPoke,2007-08-25 02:56:00,2984,"Try CAS Marine in Ayr. I know they have a bunch of smaller trailers in stock now. 401W to Cedar Creek (Exit 268). Turn right, go over the highway and a couple of miles up the road there is a road side sign on the left. The building fronts the highway so you have to go through a very large parking lot to get to it. If you pass the RV center, you've gone to far. http://www.casmarine.com/"
