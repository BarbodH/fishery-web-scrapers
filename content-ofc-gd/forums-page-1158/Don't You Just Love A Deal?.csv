Not too many available as most stores don't carry them this time of year and at least the ones we looked at were pretty junky looking. So anyway earlier this week I see an ad in the paper for a wooden patio set, asking $200. I go over Tuesday morning to look at it, and man was it rough looking! The person selling had no idea what kind of wood it was, ""some kind of hardwood I think"" he says. Well, fact is I identified it right away as teak. If you don't know how much this stuff costs, google and check, you'll be shocked. I ended up talking him down to $150, and drove away feeling like a thief, LOL!  Wasn't thinking at the time so no before pictures, but rest assured it was gross. 17 hours of sanding, then 3 hours of rubbing teak oil into it and voila, a work of art  . Picked up some cushions and an umbrella this morning to finish it off...      I just love doing stuff like this, working with my hands where the results are so immediate and tangible! Saving roughly $1200 isn't so bad either  .  cheers,  Mike"

107184,redx,2007-08-24 18:30:00,60,WOW! nice find!  150$ wow great!
107188,ccmtcanada,2007-08-24 18:35:00,7971,Wow!! Hope he's not a member on this board....LOL.  Great job on the patio set!
107189,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-24 18:37:00,698,"Amazing, a teak set like that sells for at least 1500!"
107192,Zib,2007-08-24 18:49:00,369,That's an awesome job you did.
107193,lew,2007-08-24 18:51:00,12767,"Beautiful job on the re-finishing Mike, very impressive work indeed !!"
107198,solopaddler,2007-08-24 19:23:00,8605,Thanks boys! (I think this little project just scored me some major brownie points )
107215,charlied,2007-08-24 19:56:00,584,I love the design of the top table and the bottom legs...very unique
107244,fatherof3,2007-08-24 21:05:00,1769,"wow,nice set and what  a steal"
107247,Beats,2007-08-24 21:23:00,543,yeah it looks quite nice.  Be sure to figure out a plan on storing it out of the elements for the winter.

107303,solopaddler,2007-08-24 23:21:00,8605," Unfortunately no it doesn't fold up. But that's okay, beggars can't be choosers  ."
107304,Joey,2007-08-24 23:25:00,9122,It was just the way the bottom legs looked.  Kind of like they did one of those wood box slidy tricks or something  Joey
