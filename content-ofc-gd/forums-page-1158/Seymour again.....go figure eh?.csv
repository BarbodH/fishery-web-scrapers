I know, it's a problem, but I'm dealing with it just fine.  I took pics of another animal on the mountain today....this time an animal waaaay smaller.  I give you....the Pika.....        lil' action shot..    a ship in the bay..    and a little scenery to end the post...    once again......thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy"
