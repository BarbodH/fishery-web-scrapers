107490,Garyv,2007-08-25 13:35:00,547,"Want it to last longer....have it undercoated, my personal preference is Krown.  Our one vehicle has had it applied every year for the last 7 and not a rust spot on it the same goes for my truck.  Well worth the yearly expense in my opinion."
107678,tinbanger,2007-08-26 03:26:00,1028,Gonna miss seeing that VW on the 400 Put a OFC  sticker on it so I know its you!  Congrats  TB
107691,motv8tr,2007-08-26 10:29:00,2587,"Thanks TB, don't know if I'm ready for a new sticker though, being so new I'm having a hard time with the idea of putting anything on it   You'll still know it's me by my plate though  Maureen"
107692,musky_man,2007-08-26 10:33:00,159,Great to see good things happen to a good person!  Enjoy.

107257,motv8tr,2007-08-24 21:44:00,2587,"Hey all, as you can tell by my lack of reports I haven't done much fishing this year.  In the last two years I've gone out with Beans once every week or two, this year we haven't been out at all   While part of the reason was stuff going on here at home, the biggest reason was my car.  It has been in need of repair for some time now.  In the past two or more months more and more has gone wrong with it to the point that I took it off the road about two weeks ago.  The cost of repairs was more than the car is worth.  With a little creative finacial juggling I was able to buy a brand new car    I picked her up this afternoon  Here she is      It's a 2007 Kia sportage, AWD, 5 speed  Thanks to a fellow member here I managed to get a GREAT insurance rate   Turns out he's offering a bit of a discount to fellow OFC'rs and was able to do so much better for me than my old company that I had been with for at least 10 yrs.  Thanks Dave!!!  Now maybe I can go fishing once or twice  Maureen"
107260,fatherof3,2007-08-24 21:47:00,1769,congrats! nice car for sure. My friend has a Kia Rios and has not had any problems with it.Hope you have years of enjoyment out of it

107267,Big Cliff,2007-08-24 22:00:00,6899,"I am so happy to see you finally got something reliable and I'll bet that in the long run it costs you less than driving a ""pre owned car"".  So, can you please PM me the contact information for the insurance, I'm thinking I might want to shop around too."
107270,Joey,2007-08-24 22:05:00,9122,"That's great Mo, you must be thrilled.  Congrats on the new car, wooohoooo.  Joey"

107309,John,2007-08-24 23:51:00,2956,"Great choice Mo. The Koreans, (Kia/Hyundai) have got their build quality comparable to the Japanese. Should serve you well.  John"
107327,Dano,2007-08-25 00:37:00,719,"Well done Mo, congrats! Looks like a sweet ride."

107343,Daplumma,2007-08-25 01:00:00,1961,"Great news,that old VW scared the crap out of me! Joe"
107368,Garyv,2007-08-25 02:19:00,547,Congrats on the new wheels this does mean however that you can't use the my car won't start excuse anymore!....LOL
107371,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-25 02:25:00,1183,Congratulations...don't ya just love that new smell.
107380,SlowPoke,2007-08-25 02:34:00,2984,Congrats Mo! Kudos to Dave for a good quote on the insurance too!
107382,banger,2007-08-25 02:37:00,95,Buying a brand new car is someting everyone should do once in there life time. It can be a good thing.  KIA is a lotta car for the money. Hard to beat.   Enjoy.
107457,Photoz,2007-08-25 10:07:00,792,"VER R R  R   Y nice . . . .   if it snows enough to get THAT one stuck, NOBODY'S going anywhere!! Nice new fresh-smellin' car . . . .     bet it's off-limits to cigarettes, eh? If it wasn't for my 10, 12 & 13' fishin' rods, I'd sure be looking one like that over! My bet with the 5 gear it's also decent on fuel . . . .    enjoy!"
107462,motv8tr,2007-08-25 11:04:00,2587," How do you think I felt driving it up to two weeks ago  Thanks for all the nice comments folks, I'm pretty happy with haveing a brand new car, and from all the reports I've heard and found on this vehicle it should last me a few years.   Oh and Steve, I think it would hold all your rods easily, as long as you don't want to have any passengers   Well you might get away with one in the front seat.  One of the things I really like about this truck is that all but the drivers seat folds down completely, which give you tonnes of room to haul stuff...including my dogs  Maureen"
107466,ccmtcanada,2007-08-25 11:48:00,7971,Congrats Mo!!  Great looking car and I have heard some great things about Kia recently.  Now all you need is a big OFC Community sticker for it!!  Oh yeah...that insurance guy...care to share his name?  My policy is coming up for renewal....thanks!
107468,mcallister.grant,2007-08-25 11:59:00,327,"Hey Maureen,  Great car!! It is a very reliable SUV! The quality has come a long was since they were first introduced! See you soon!"
