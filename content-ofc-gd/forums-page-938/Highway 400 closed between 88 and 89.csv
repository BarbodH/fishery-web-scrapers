270271,Joey,2008-11-21 20:46:00,9122,Highway 400 Link  I learned about is as a coworker has called from her car.  She left here at noon and has been sitting with her engine off and has not moved.  Joey
270273,tinbanger,2008-11-21 20:48:00,1028,I picked a good day to work from home !
270274,misfish,2008-11-21 20:50:00,29133,"No one has been seriously hurt. They have all the lanes closed to make sure no more concrete is going to fall. They say it maybe a few hours til they open up the lanes again.  If your heading up,exit 88,head either east to Huronia rd,or head west to Vetran dr."

270321,douG,2008-11-21 22:41:00,2693,"Terry, did you see anyone you know?  I should think so."
270323,Terry,2008-11-21 22:43:00,14456,no  it was only 1 million people driving around in circles trying to get out of town seems they went in circles 42 times
270324,BillM,2008-11-21 22:44:00,17367,"I wouldn't even touch the 400NB tonight.  I got off at 9, made my way over to 5srd, then west on 13th, then up 8th line all the way to 25th, then back on to 27N..  Lots of snow coming down, whatever way you take be careful!"
