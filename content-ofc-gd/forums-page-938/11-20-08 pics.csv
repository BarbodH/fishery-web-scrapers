269944,Greencoachdog,2008-11-20 23:46:00,8163,"It was such a beautiful day today... I had to put everything on ""hold"" this afternoon and take the boat out.  Twas 64*F and light winds... for about 30 minutes after I was on the water  The main agenda for today was this:  Relaxation!!!  I didn't even hit the dam, because that would have been too much work casting!  Drowning minnows and lookin' for Mr. Crappie was today's task... never did find Mr. Crappie!  ... but these ""spots"" wanted to play!  I caught all but 1 on my homemade Cabela's wobble jig (1/8th oz.) and a 5"" plastic grub.   A little cutie pie!   A little bigger   Just slightly larger than the one above   Biggest ""jig"" fish of the day   This one couldn't resist the live minnow on the Sabiki rig!  As you can see, the wind got up a little and it turned freezin' cold... so I had to put on a long sleeve shirt!  It was a nice 4 hrs. on the water!"
