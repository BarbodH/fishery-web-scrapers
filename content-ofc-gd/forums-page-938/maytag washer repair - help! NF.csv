270247,tinbanger,2008-11-21 20:09:00,1028,"our old ( 15 year plus,came with the house) Maytag washer has started to leak .It appears that the seal where the drive passes thru the bottom of the drum has failed. from everything I can find on the web ( and talking to local appliance parts place) the repair is fairly involved and requires some special tools ( to remove nut and pull out seal).  wondering if anyone has any experince with this , do it your self or otherwise.  apparently these older machines are 'workhorses' and are worth spending $s on.  thanks for any advice  TB"
