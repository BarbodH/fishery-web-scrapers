269895,Big Cliff,2008-11-20 21:48:00,6899,"Wanted a special book one year but I figured no one would think to buy it for me so I bought it, got the ladies at the mall to wrap it, and put it under the tree To Cliff,  from Santa.  For years my mom thought my wife had gotten it for me and my wife thought my mom had gotten it for me. They didn't find out until one day my mom commented on how much I used the book that Sue had gotten me and they realized that there had to have been another Santa that year LOL."
