269835,iceslayer,2008-11-20 19:01:00,97,Well I had to do it.  I hit a local pond this morning (off the dock) in search of some first ice crappies.  All I found were a couple of largemouth that came into the Vexilar screen like a rocket and smoked that little jig..  Did it ever feel great pulling the ice fishing equipment out.  Great day!  Cheers

269986,Rizzo,2008-11-21 00:45:00,4754,"right on! I just checked out a local pond on my way home from work and it was iced over too. Only has snot-rocket pike in it, but for some reason I don't have an issue targetting dink pike if its through the ice. I just love watching that orange flag waving . couple more weeks and I'll give it a go"

This pond only produces crappie early in the morning and just before dark.  Just gett'n ice fishin was a hell of a treat, but I want a nice crappie lunch.  Cheers"
270404,Rich,2008-11-22 01:24:00,3927,Not too often you can go ice fishing for largies legally! Good stuff! Looks like we may have plenty of ice on the ponds before Christmas. Let's keep our fingers crossed!
