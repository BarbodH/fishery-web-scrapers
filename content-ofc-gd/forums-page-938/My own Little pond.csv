For all of you who like to fish bass or carp or even the ocassional catfish, I just thought i'd let you know about this little pond I found 2 minutes from my house. It's litteraly 2 minutes walking from my house and I'm catching some nice sized largeys. We've pulled a couple of carp anddd catfish out of there too. I think it's great to have somewhere to practice my techniques. Personally I'm more into steelhead and trout but fish are fish and they're fun to catch!"
270027,Leecher,2008-11-21 02:20:00,7832,Great stuff Marcus      got to love it to have a fish pond 2 minutes walking from home  Let us know how you do next time you go Leechman
270151,davis,2008-11-21 15:47:00,128,ferry lake?
270175,Billy - Curtiss,2008-11-21 16:56:00,241,Nice! I wish that I had my own little brookie pond!
270188,ricoboxing,2008-11-21 17:42:00,398,i have this little pond thats walking distance to my house too. I think it's called lake ontario.
270194,JohnF,2008-11-21 18:00:00,3494," Bass? Lucky you. I've got water just a few minutes from my house too, but it's full of nothing but swans and big ole stinky carp.  JF"
270236,Wild,2008-11-21 19:40:00,704, John are you a habitual carp sniffer?
270291,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-21 21:35:00,182,"Nope not fairy Lake, I've tried there but I haven't caught anything."
270295,johnnyb,2008-11-21 21:47:00,3413,"Ooohhh a guessing game -- how fun!  is it the pond at Wesley Brooks conservation area?  Or the pond beside St. Johns' sideroad, just east of Yonge?"
270297,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-21 21:49:00,182,"lol, nope, I dont thimk that anyone really knows about it or even thinks theres fish in there"
270300,johnnyb,2008-11-21 21:51:00,3413,"Well, this could go on forever, 'cuz I can see all kinds of little ponds over there    Have fun"
270395,JohnF,2008-11-22 01:11:00,3494," Hardly, but I'm told they're stinky, and they always seem to be in the way when I'm looking fer real fish (i.e. bass). Given that they spend their lives snuffling up the crud on the bottom of our polluted rivers it would hardly be their fault if they're a tad stinky. My bass stay away from the bottom. Ergo they smell nice.  JF"
270442,Wild,2008-11-22 02:38:00,704,HAHA OK then I was worried that the townspeople might be knocking on your door with clubs in hand
