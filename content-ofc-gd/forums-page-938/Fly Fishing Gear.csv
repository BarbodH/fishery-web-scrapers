270312,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-21 22:17:00,182,"Heello there fellow fishermen.many of you prabably didn't know that I am 14. I LOVE Fishing. Best sport on the world. I have heard that a lot of the ""seasoned Anglers"" have concerns that the younger generations won't take the same kind of liking to fishing and bring the same level of passion. Well I for one love the sport and hope to continue for the rest of my life. The type of fishing I like is fly fishing. I've taken a few coarses on the casting basics and all that, but now it's time to get my gear. Due to Stellar mid term report card, my parents have opened the window for me to choose some fly fishing gear I want for christmas.   This is what I have picked out for myself. I'll be fishing for steelhead, Trout, and salmon.  Orvis Battenkill Large Arbor Reel - http://www.wilsonstoronto.com/ProductDetai...ue/Default.aspx  Rio Steelhead and salmon Fly Line- http://www.wilsonstoronto.com/ProductDetai...ue/Default.aspx  White River Fly Shop™ Classic Travel Fly Rods- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...5001000_175-1-2  World Wide Sportsman® Magibraid™ Gel Spun Fly Line Backing- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...5003000_175-3-1  Orvis® Floating Braided Leader- http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...5003000_175-3-2  How do you think this gear will hold up for Steelhead Salmon and Trout?"
270315,highdrifter,2008-11-21 22:33:00,2534,"Absolutely!!  Great choices there.  But if I may suggest..  You might want to be outfitted at the same place..  You may not have as high a mark up with BPS as you would with Wilsons..  It'd also save you the trip downtown..  The guys at Wilsons are great for tips and advice, but it looks like you've already got it down pat.  Tight loops dude  HD"
270320,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-21 22:41:00,182,"Thanx man, it feels good having a seconed opinion"
270342,highdrifter,2008-11-21 23:24:00,2534, That set-up is noice.  Heck I'm even thinking of blowing a wad myself...  I need a 9'6 in a 7 or an 8 wheight.. for high stick nymphin..  You're lucky to have encouraging folks like that.  Milk em while you can dude!!  aayyoooo HD
270353,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-21 23:43:00,182,"HAHAHAHA, LMAO, Thats the plan!"
270357,BillM,2008-11-21 23:50:00,17367,"Marcus, what are you planning on fishing for mostly?  Unfortunately flyrods aren't a 'one size fits all' type of setup...  Figure that out, then you should be able to make a better decision..  Good job on the grades btw!!!!!!!!!!!!  Keep it up!"
270456,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-22 03:15:00,182,"Mostly hitting Bronte or the Credit, for steelhead and salmon. would the same weight rod work for brown or brook trout? I heard the upper credit has some good numbers of browns and brookies?"
270500,danbo,2008-11-22 06:24:00,2646,You need an 8wt for Chinooks with the extended butt on the rod. GLoomis GL2 is a good start. Pflueger Trion reel is a strong reel at a decent price. Scientific Anglers Ultra 4 is my fave flyline..WF8F is perfect. You will eventually find bass fishing is fun with that rod too..using poppers. A 3wt for small head-water Brookies is fine. A 4wt for Grand River browns is sweet. A 6wt is enough for Credit steel & Smallmouth.
270504,pikeie,2008-11-22 06:38:00,380,"you dont ""need"" an 8 weight for salmon. ive been fishing for kings all year with a 6 weight, i know way to light but i broke my 8 weight this summer. so far my PB is a 25+ lbs king that was caught on the 6 weight and ive caught plenty of kings from 15-20+ lbs plus this year. i think im was in the 80's + this year!! no kidding two days with over 25 caught"
270508,Cookslav,2008-11-22 07:05:00,1457,oops double post
270509,Cookslav,2008-11-22 07:07:00,1457,"I'm no expert, but I use a 5wt....its all I got, and for the most part all I need. I have a ton of fun with it fishing Specs and browns, and I can say this. Its WAY to light for steelies. I gave her a whirl when nothing else was working this fall, and had a fairly fresh run chinny grab my fly She SCHOOLED me LOL! Had it been a Fiesty Bow it would have been an absolute gong show....not near enough back bone for a large fish 6 is doable for sure....but preference comes into play I suppose? I know If I was spending the money I'd be torn between a 7wt & 8wt  You want the play...especialy for the casting, but the back bone is crucial in a close quarters. Choose your battles lol!"
270510,danbo,2008-11-22 09:51:00,2646,Yep those lil' kings that pikie catches are fine with lighter gear!
