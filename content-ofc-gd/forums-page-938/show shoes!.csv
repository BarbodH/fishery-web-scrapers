I find the new aluminum ones aren't big enough for deep snow, and I've broken 2 sets in the process. I've had my traditional ones for at least 20 years....no probs yet. I would however like to get a set of the Ojibway style shoes......they're nice and long. Real nice for walking long distances on lakes or open country with deep snow.    Sinker"
