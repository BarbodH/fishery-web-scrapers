269593,jdmls,2008-11-20 01:37:00,575,you got it pontiac.....now go get us some fish porn
269653,mpagnan,2008-11-20 02:59:00,84,I agree...but the pressure is on!  I can't believe all the fabulous pictures being thrown around here.  I honestly wouldn't know what to do if I caught something like that.
269708,Burtess,2008-11-20 12:09:00,901, Take note of the regs before you head out on where and when you can and cannot fish...  Burt
269764,Rich,2008-11-20 15:20:00,3927,Hope you like crowds!
269793,silvio,2008-11-20 16:41:00,433, Crowds  there’s snow its cold the only people out there are the guys that love what they do. Don’t discourage someone from trying something new. Pags this type of fishing takes time to learn but when you do learn it's extremely fun and rewarding so head out put in your time and the fish will come.
269795,dobee,2008-11-20 16:59:00,301,crowds? it aint salmon season no more....
