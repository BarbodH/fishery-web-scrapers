269443,iceslayer,2008-11-19 20:33:00,97,Ooops!!  My bad.  Look'n at the wrong spot..lol  Probably wishfull think'n..
269458,mistyriver1,2008-11-19 21:19:00,600,"Some great pics limeyangler.  I was up your way in the summer on a business/fishing trip.  I actually stayed just outside of Sioux Lookout.  You have an amazing fishery up there.  So many lakes to chose from, I'm jealous.  Anyways, you were asking about Flambeau Lake and if there were any fish in there.  I was invited to go fishing out there by one of our customers but couldn't make it.  Apparently there is lots of nice walleye in there.  You can see it from right along the Trans Canada can't you, if it's the one I'm thinking of.  Also, Pritchard rings a bell too.  Good stuff"
