If anybody has info about the ice and ramp condition, please let me know.  I have launched at Picton and fished around the ferry area before, but I am also interested in launching (and fishing) the Trenton/Trent River areas.  So ice and fishing info on any area of BOQ would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance, Jackie"

270416,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-22 01:44:00,141,While crossing the southern bridge in Trenton yesterday late afternoon I saw a boat fishing the mouth of the river-no sign of ice;I didn't go by the ramps so I don't know what kind of shape they're in.
