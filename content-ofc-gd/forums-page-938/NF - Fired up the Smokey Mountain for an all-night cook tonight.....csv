270452,Wild,2008-11-22 03:03:00,704,BURT! Did I ever mention that your my favorite OFC member Where did you get the maple leaf?
270453,irishfield,2008-11-22 03:04:00,26272,Something about Pork and slow cook scares the bejebers out of me... oh yah ... it's the tape worm. Hope it hits high temp at some point?
270465,Burtess,2008-11-22 03:28:00,901," Code of Federal Regulations (specifically, 9CFR318.10, pp 244-256, revised in January 2003, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/9CFR318.10.htm ) that includes a time @ temp chart.  Minimum Internal Temp   F ...... C ...... Minimum Time ________________________________  120 ... 49 ... 21 hours  122 ... 50 ... 9.5 hours  124 ... 51.1 ... 4.5 hours  126 ... 52.2 ... 2 hours  128 ... 53.4 ... 1 hour  130 ... 54.5 ... 30 min  132 ... 55.6 ... 15 min  134 ... 56.7 ... 6 min  136 ... 57.8 ... 3 min  138 ... 58.9 ... 2 min  140 ... 60 ... 1 min  142 ... 61.1 ... 1 min  144 ... 62.2 ... Instant  When refering to trichinella it is not just the temp the meat is cooked to, it is also a function of time at that temp. I am going to pull this pork so I will be going to approx. 195F internal temperature which is way beyond the instant kill temp of trichinella.  Burt"
270467,irishfield,2008-11-22 03:30:00,26272,Good stuff !
270564,Burtess,2008-11-22 14:55:00,901, LOL.... You can pick up Maple Leaf at most Home Hardware and Rona stores.  Burt
270566,Burtess,2008-11-22 14:59:00,901,"Just cracked the lid for the first time since I put them on, about 14 hours ago. It was pretty cold when my temperature alarm went off at around 3:30am and I had to go out and adjust vents and stir the coals. Internal temps in the early 180's now.  Should be ready in another couple of hours  Here is what they look like now:   Burt"
270571,Wild,2008-11-22 15:06:00,704,"HEHE I don't shop at those stores will have to pick up a bag though . I am beginning to learn how make my own blend of charcoal though, I have plenty of rock maple, beech, cherry, white oak, hickory, birch and more stock seasoning right now."
270576,douG,2008-11-22 15:29:00,2693,"The last charcoal I used came from China.  I couldn't believe it.  We are waiting for the final pictures and verdict, btw."
270587,Wild,2008-11-22 16:09:00,704,"Sorry to hear that Doug, glad you survived the stinky toxic additives though, I would rather eat from a gas BBQ!"
270635,Burtess,2008-11-22 18:12:00,901," Yeah, I stay away from the Chinese stuff, might be burning melamine along with it! Actually I will only buy lump that originates in the USA or Canada, much of the stuff that originates in South America I think comes from the rain forest and that can't be good!  More pics in a couple of hours, the meat is now wrapped in foil and towels and is resting in a cooler...  Burt"
270643,Wild,2008-11-22 18:25:00,704,Meanwhile... wow they have all of Dundas and directions on google earth!  I have ribs and Angus rib eye on the grill for today
270647,Smokey,2008-11-22 18:35:00,1278,Looks great. I have almost the exact same smoker. Keep the pics coming and enjoy.  Mike
270684,Burtess,2008-11-22 20:24:00,901,The finished product.....   Now to make some Carolina style vinegar based sauce and I'm all set!  Burt
270686,Wild,2008-11-22 20:31:00,704,Very nice Burt! Enjoy.
270692,Leecher,2008-11-22 20:49:00,7832,Yummm that looks real delicious..... what time you said to come over Leechman
270698,Burtess,2008-11-22 21:11:00,901," I'm a long way from Gatineau, it may be all gone by the time you get here  Burt"
270700,Leecher,2008-11-22 21:14:00,7832, 
270808,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-23 01:04:00,2582, Does anyone else see the rabbit?  JK...if I had not just finished some steaks and shrimp skewers on the barbie I would be hunting your place down for sure.
