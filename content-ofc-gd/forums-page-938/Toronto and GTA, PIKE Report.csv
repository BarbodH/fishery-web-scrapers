269724,BITEME,2008-11-20 12:51:00,1969,Nice been waiting to see whats been happening in the smoke might be worth getting a boat in there on the weekend Thanks
269752,MJL,2008-11-20 14:42:00,2427,Awesome report Snag
269766,Rich,2008-11-20 15:23:00,3927,"Man, I'd be happy with pike like that especially if I could get them from shore. Nothing going on around here right now! Actually went out yesterday and just about every spot I wanted to fish was frozen up (though only a half centimetre of ice). Nice work!"
269789,snag,2008-11-20 16:37:00,1932," Thanks Doug. I always value your words   I'm trying not to blur shots so I crop and get in close sometimes. Did you see how far I'm holding some of those things out though, LOL, charleton! P.s. I don't need an excuse like a hospital visit to give myself a ""brazillian"". and if you ever meet Snagelina, the witness protection program has failed.......   Thought you could relate!!!!!    I'd like to hit that spot you pm'd me about a couple years back. Could be good!   You usually have the first ice reports if I recall correctly?"
269791,snag,2008-11-20 16:38:00,1932,echo
269821,ehg,2008-11-20 18:26:00,2666,"Another great and humorous T.O report there SNAG/Grant hopefully more to come.  Nice fish! Why wait till March? Right now it has to be 8-10 lbs solid.  Hopefully that program will work, there is a couple of 'Goodfellas' that want to speak with you.  Nice post again, ehg"
269904,ccmtcanada,2008-11-20 22:11:00,7971," Oh come on Grant...you know me better than that....LOL.  It's good to see an actual fishing report from you again.  You are still the king of Urban Pike.  If we get out this fall, don't worry.....I'll bring a net...don't want your delicate hands to get hurt carrying one around."
269922,highdrifter,2008-11-20 22:55:00,2534,   If only FHR was here..
270014,snag,2008-11-21 01:58:00,1932," I keep harrassing Steve, he's a good sport.  Thanks Erik/EHG   As king, I would expect no less. Now, where's my pi$$ bucket?   As King, I would have FHR tortured (for his knowledge) and then beheaded.  Now come kiss my feet Birdman."
270088,Billy - Curtiss,2008-11-21 13:23:00,241,Any of you fruit cakes up for some frigid piking today?!
270112,snag,2008-11-21 14:29:00,1932," I'd come out to play just to see you freeze banjolina.  Today is sketchy, how is next week?  PM me"
270128,Billy - Curtiss,2008-11-21 15:07:00,241,Next Thursday is the only possible day next week that I can throw down.
270149,ccmtcanada,2008-11-21 15:41:00,7971," I said you were king, not that I was the pi$$ boy."
269434,snag,2008-11-19 20:21:00,1932,"Hey Y'all,  I'm a loser.  It's rather frustrating. I would have more to show if I used a net but I don't like to use them. Being a shore angler, I don't need the extra weight. No excuses here. I lose a chunk of catches in high elevation areas and poor hook-ups that get off as I attempt to hand-land them. I have accepted being a loser for the comfort of less accessories.  Luckily, marriage has conditioned me to accept crushing disappointment on a semi-regular basis.   These catches were had on the way to work, lunch and homebound. I don't fish on weekends. They are from last week and a bit, (as you'll notice by the lighter clothes in some pics)  I have not been very successful as of late. Time is limited.  Lotsa dinks like this have plagued me          I love water shots (before I screw things up and lose them like a king bonehead extraodinaire) HJ chartreuse  Storm jointed   Surprise November LM caught on a spro almost as big!      Only pike were invited   Can't wait to see this dude in March!  Nice tail   How to get to know your Harbour police   The Captain of the Exxon Valdez's leisure boat    The 1st sticker reads,  ""I love cats, they taste like chicken"" The 2nd sticker reads, ""CAT, the other white meat""    Specializing in making problems disappear. Wonder if they've ever worked under the table? Goodfellas Construction   (note: if anything were to happen to me, please call the police)  Thanks,  S."
269437,jwl,2008-11-19 20:24:00,1056,"right on, cold water feedbag pike, gotta love it  my best days last year where January on Erie, ice was in, then melted, the pike fishing exploded for like 2 weeks, I got like 40 fish or more in 3 outings  thnaks for the tease"
269444,Leecher,2008-11-19 20:34:00,7832,Great report and pics SNAG  Nothing wrong in catching small pikes..... loads of fun when the biting is on And for the net..... I never leave home without it  Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
269452,bicephalic,2008-11-19 20:48:00,112,"Nice report, looks like some fun fish!  B"
269455,bigugli,2008-11-19 20:56:00,6138,"Who cares if you didn't get the pikie in your hands. If you got it to the shore or ledge, got to see it before it shook off, good enough for me.  Water shot is even better. WTG  Thanks for the porn. That turns my crank for the day."
269460,highdrifter,2008-11-19 21:23:00,2534,Snag... You're not a looser..  I'm sure your mom thinks your cool.  Your wife on the other hand.. well.. she prolly thinks you're a dingus.  Noice juans mang.  You gonna post that incidental from today?  cheers HD
269465,Billy - Curtiss,2008-11-19 21:36:00,241,Perhaps your inconsistency in landing those bad boys is directly attributable to your choice of footwear? They see those office loafers and they bolt for the high seas because they figure you're going to subject them to the tedium of the mail room!
269468,snag,2008-11-19 21:55:00,1932," Things will mellow for awhile and then hopefully they'll be back to feed more.   Thanks, I actually like the fight of small fish better.   PM me and I'll tell you where to go   I just wanted to show off the bigger ones I lost, that's what hurts!   Your new species report might come out next week when I have some time. I might be a dingus but you proved today that you're.... Gullible    I think you're definitely on to something there Billy. Perhaps if you were there with the net, like before, I wouldn't be such a whiner?"
269470,limeyangler,2008-11-19 21:57:00,5204,"great report and creative photgraphy...hmmmmmm  anyway, great shots.....thanks for sharing."
269480,Rich Clemens,2008-11-19 22:08:00,3131,Attaboy Snag.  Ain't nuttin' wrong with a little pike action.   Very Nice.

269502,holdfast,2008-11-19 23:06:00,1813,"Nice report Snag, love the action shots and had a good chuckle at the end."
269538,Joey,2008-11-20 00:05:00,9122,Some nice pike there Snag.  D'ya think that van driver is a cat lover  Gonna have to design yourself an inflatable net  Joey
269540,Cudz,2008-11-20 00:12:00,2652,"Nice fish.  Especially from shore.  I once read a bumper stick about a cat.  It read  ""Looking for your cat?  Check under my tires"""
269541,Bernie,2008-11-20 00:16:00,3190,Very good post Snag. Does anyone at your work chew about the fishy pike smell?
269544,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-20 00:28:00,3761,"nice man, those were all very nice pike. Coongrads on the catches and best of luck in the future"
269641,Governator,2008-11-20 02:36:00,879,"lol, fishing in work clothes - excellent  nice fish too!"
269672,Bly,2008-11-20 03:43:00,1556,"Nice and about time too, was beginning to think you didn't love us anymore  lol    Ever try one of those folding nets?"
269674,PatrickGG,2008-11-20 04:04:00,562,"Nice T.o pike there snag, i was actually thinking bout do a run this weekend, weather pending ""i dont wanna stand in the snow"" so i hope one day this weekend will be clear."
269675,snag,2008-11-20 04:06:00,1932,Thanks for your replies everyone!  The cold days are upon us.  Time to huddle.  Grrrrr
269676,snag,2008-11-20 04:14:00,1932," Workin' on it!   I keep saying that my tuna sandwiches leak.   Cliff is going to burn me again. I've been a little cheeky with him lately. I deserve it.....   I think it looks good though HD and I tried today and failed. They are deep and slow like a stoned poet, Good luck pat!"
269685,douG,2008-11-20 05:05:00,2693,"Snag, as far as I can tell, you make up these amazing phrases outa whole cloth.  That's some fine work there. Thanks to you, and to your muse too also."
269706,Greencoachdog,2008-11-20 12:07:00,8163,"Real nice report, pics, and fish!!!  Glad to see you're getting a bit of fishin' in!  Shold we ever meet, I can learn you how to take pics and get the whole fish in the frame... they look bigger that way, kinda like when they shave off yer pubes at the hospital!  ... and if I should ever meet Snagelina, I'll be sure to tell her you said this:  "
269713,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-20 12:34:00,2050, LOL my wife even laughed at that line dude! Probably the funniest line I've seen on OFC....  Thanks for the TO report man!  UF
269719,Moosebunk,2008-11-20 12:42:00,3970,Great fishing SNAG.  Enjoyed the humor in this report.  Thanks for sharing.
