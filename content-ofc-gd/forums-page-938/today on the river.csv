270340,jwl,2008-11-21 23:20:00,1056,"Well first off, this is the kind of fish you catch when you don't have your sign with you and your team needs a GL trout       I lost another one before that in the range of 10 lbs when it decided it was done jumping and thought for a change that it would dive right under my boat and try and come out the other side..and snap!!!!, had one other big fish on just long enough for a teaser.  And started the day off with this one..kepping my 5 years non boat skunk going..I may not always get em, but as long as a fish sees my boat, it's all good..5 years and still going strong   Also got ths one as well.we will vist them in about 10 days     I don't think he liked me though      was a pretty cold snowy day out on the river..but well worth the effort for me amyways."
270341,irishfield,2008-11-21 23:22:00,26272,OH... what a monster ! As for your sign... as long as you're not on Joey's team... no problem leaving it at home! LOL

270359,BillM,2008-11-21 23:51:00,17367,"Wow, that is the definition of a rocket!!!  Good job man, to bad about the sign  :)  Atleast you didn't forget the camera!"
270360,douG,2008-11-21 23:54:00,2693,"jwl, that is one huge pink slash of chrome.  Gorgeous feesh.  Congratulations to you.  The feisty laker is a good shot too.  Eye Before EE.  I don't know why I put up that link, I guess I just like it."
270361,wuchikubo,2008-11-21 23:56:00,1114,"JWL, nice chromer, what a catch!"
270368,jwl,2008-11-22 00:17:00,1056,"thanks folks, it was one of those days where you get frozen snotcicles out there, snow flyin, wind coming the wrong way up the river, thus really limiting where you can fish   I guess it payed off though.  As for not forgetting the camera, my buddy took the pics, and my team sign...at the bottom of the other half of my tackle bag, I downsized to just my trout stuff for todays mission..I knew I was gonna get something as I have at least one all my last outings, so I knew I was going to get one bigger in the next few weeks to enter...go figure I had to get a hog today  It was a blast they are fresh and crazy to boot, that one jumped out of the water a whole bunch of times.  It's just the start of my winter season, many more to come..I just hope the ones in the mid teens like that one come out to play more...no camera tricks in that pic either, it's a hog, I was holding it pretty much against my chest...if you compare to the greaser you can get the idea....man  The Slammers needed that fish big time...guess it's up to me to redeem myself on that one...I am hog hunting tommorrow for a derby so,I will bring my sign this time"
270383,Wild,2008-11-22 00:41:00,704,That's a real beauty Jack what is your largest trophy so far?
270394,jwl,2008-11-22 01:11:00,1056, for steelies....22lbs( caught in the mid 1980's- Whirlpool from shore)...that's my best one this season so far since last winter/spring I got today
270400,wallacio,2008-11-22 01:18:00,475,Great fish!   Did you get a weight or measurements?
270406,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-22 01:26:00,141,Beauty fish-hitting the water in that kind of weather you deserved to be rewarded-congrats.
270415,jwl,2008-11-22 01:44:00,1056," nope quick CPR on that one...from past experience I would give it an honest 13-14 lbs, I don't like hanging fish that big on a scale..bad for the fish.....if I had my dam logo/sign with me I would have measured it for sure"
270435,wallacio,2008-11-22 02:17:00,475,"Sometimes tough to tell from a photo but I would agree with your estimate...again, nice one!"
