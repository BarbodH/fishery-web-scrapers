269854,silvio,2008-11-20 20:26:00,433,Siglon v for the 100th time.
269860,BillM,2008-11-20 20:39:00,17367,I use finely twisted hair strands from virgin unicorns.  Works pretty good.
269861,denisk,2008-11-20 20:41:00,163, Actually I was placing an order and well I guess you already know the rest.  Glad you like the carp any other fish you'd like to see
269862,redx,2008-11-20 20:41:00,60,sigalon F.... I been using that line for years.  That stopped last week when my main line broke like 5 times. I don't know if the line was bad / old or if i left it out on the sun to much? no idea and not going to guess. I even pulled out descent amount of mainline and tied back every thing but still...  Never had that issue before. Now I'm going to try sigalon v 10lb with 6lb tippet.
269866,solopaddler,2008-11-20 20:52:00,8605,"  My guess would be no LOL!  Siglon might be okay for the guys who strictly finesse fish and/or fish places like the east trib's mostly, but for larger flows I don't like it.  If you must use it bump up to 12lb, it's still very thin."
269876,denisk,2008-11-20 21:11:00,163,"I beleive there is bad batches of line like everything else you find these days, I've had customers tell me the same thing the siglon they bought snapped like 2 pound tippet but I've yet to hit one of those spools.  Personal preference obviously because i've been fishing the Niagara with siglon 10lb and it hasn't failed me yet.    However like you can see in this post everyone has their own opinion and preference."
269916,kemper,2008-11-20 22:45:00,2232,"I know I said raven but not sure if I said what test.. Seems like most are running 10 or 12,  I run 8 and have NEVER snapped off above my lead. I run a strong lead too, maxima ultragreen in anywhere from 4 to 6"

270153,DANIMAL,2008-11-21 16:04:00,215,I stocked up on 10 lb iron silk when they still made it so I'm still using that. But I've used 10 lb XT and big game and it works good too.
270167,kentooley,2008-11-21 16:47:00,208, Hey JDMLS!!  I'm liking you more with each post!!!!  :lol:  A question for the one and only Raven rep. Has anyone ever complained about line stretch with their line or is it just me??  :lol:   Signed  NotaFan
269433,KelfuN,2008-11-19 20:20:00,246,I've been using 10lb siglon V as my mainline for steelheads so far this year....and my spool is starting to run out..im thinking of trying ande lines or raven lines.  just wondering what lines you guys use for steelheads in the winter?
269438,BillM,2008-11-19 20:25:00,17367,12lb Siglon V high vis.
269446,ccmtcanada,2008-11-19 20:38:00,7971,I use 8 lb mono.  Maximum leader I put on is 6lb.  Never had any issues with the mainline at all.
269448,wallacio,2008-11-19 20:41:00,475,"Raven 12lb (low-vis green for me).   Great line - thin relative to the line rating, stays supple (low memory), floats well (easy mending, line control)."
269450,kemper,2008-11-19 20:44:00,2232,"RAVEN high vis green and pink  its cheap, strong as nails and floats well. Relatively low memory although if you side cast all day it will twist up (what wont)"
269482,Ranger22,2008-11-19 22:15:00,18,P-line cx premium 8lb clear florescent very low memory and no twist up.
269485,troutologist,2008-11-19 22:20:00,951,"I run the raven (grey) in 10lb and have been thoroughly impressed with it. Chose that color since it blends into the waters I fish when they are clear and low.  I actually found I had better results (more hits in clear water) than when I ran siglon (yellow), I dont run a shot line just main --> leader, which could contribute to my findings."
269486,Canuck2fan,2008-11-19 22:21:00,1444,Raven rules.... I find it to be amazing line for the price. I tried Ande and it just isn't as good although it does cost more.
269494,kentooley,2008-11-19 22:43:00,208,Siglon V
269495,silvio,2008-11-19 22:45:00,433,Siglon v 12 pound find 10lb a bit weak for 6 pound leader.
269530,tibbs,2008-11-19 23:59:00,650,I use siglon f 12lb.
269546,NAC,2008-11-20 00:30:00,369,8# Ande mono

269555,jdmls,2008-11-20 00:40:00,575,"siglon F 10lb gold/yellow color ..... Raven come's in a 1000yd spool @ the same price as most lines with 330yd spools for a reason   ...Sorry to bash it as a lot of guys luv the stuff it seems, but the factory Raven rep told me himself when he saw me pick up that 1000yd spool off the shelf... ""put it back down , and pick up the siglon !! I rep them and get it for free, and still don't use it  "" ....Never tried it and probably never will after that reliable source gave me his honest opinion..."
269670,KelfuN,2008-11-20 03:41:00,246,i guess i'll just respool my line again with siglon V. i tend to find the F series have a bigger memory than the V...or maybe im just paranoid about perfection..lol
269750,MJL,2008-11-20 14:35:00,2427," Ironic thing is I've never had a positive experience with Siglon lines apart from their leader material and now exclusively use either Raven or Maxima (8-10). I've tried a few different spools of Siglon in lb tests ranging from 6-12lb.  I found it didn't matter about the breaking strain of the line, all of them suffered from poor knot strength and poor abrasion resistance - To put things in perspective, I was breaking 10lb mainlines bringing in 6 inch baby rainbows (or at least trying to).  Had every conventional knot break - from simple clinch and blood to trilene, grinner and polomar - And yes I do lubricate my knots.  Odd bad spool?  Perhaps but I bought their lines over the last 6 years from various local retailers.  Definitely put me away from Siglon lines.  Been using Raven since 2002 and in terms of performance consistency, I've never had any noticeable problems with any of the spools other than if you go below 6lb on a centrepin, you'll find it stretches and digs in."
269758,Steel28,2008-11-20 14:59:00,160,"Been using siglov V for a few seasons as main line and very happy with results. Tried Andy, Raven, Maxima and many others - always went back to V.  Good luck."
269767,solopaddler,2008-11-20 15:23:00,8605,"I've been lured into trying Siglon on more than one occasion because so many guys swear by it. Never again. Frankly imo it's garbage. Never have I used a mainline that consistently broke above the float like Siglon LOL! It has terrible abrasion resistance, and is just too limp too effectively run on a centrepin imo. Each to their own though  Best performing line and value for your dollar is 12lb Raven in the low vis green, it's great stuff.  Drennan Super mono in 8lb is incredible if you can find a source, but pricey."
269768,super dave,2008-11-20 15:28:00,323,Currently using 8lb raven in hi vis pink but I just ordered some signlon V.  I just can't get used to the shot line.
269769,Rich,2008-11-20 15:35:00,3927,10lb hi vis raven is what I use.. it was recommended to me at the tackle shop when I bought my float reel and has performed just fine.
269772,aniceguy,2008-11-20 15:46:00,1094,"3 pn combo's here 1 has ande 8 tournament on it and I swear by it have had some tanks beached abrasion and castability are mint...  2 has sigalon 12 on it and it fishes ok until around 2 in the afternoon when line twist comes into it, not very abrasion proof and sorta feels like rope IMO but its a bigger water stick that has ultra green as a leader and if its floro its 10 lb  3. trilene sensation in 8lb...only been on it for 1 trip so I cant really give it a fair shot but it did beach fish, had no line twist and floated pretty nice I  will fish it tomm, maybe even today ( if I can get the motivation)"
269776,tonyb,2008-11-20 15:54:00,1637, And the line holds up to several uni-knots tying segments together
269814,blaque,2008-11-20 18:07:00,2419,"Ive used Ironsilk in the past and found it quite good. But it is no longer made Ive got suffix elite on now in 8 lb........and it REALLY seems to enhance the line twist. Im trying really hard to incorporate spin casting 100% of the time, but its more like 50-50 lol."
269819,denisk,2008-11-20 18:21:00,163,"   I spoke with the Raven rep today and that he told me that he only runs Raven Main Line on his float reels (and never ever told anyone to purchase a different line).  Not only that, but one of his customers landed a 54lbs Chinook in Alaska using Raven Main Line - and any line that can take that kind of abuse has to be awesome!  I find it funny how things can get posted on the internet and be taken as the truth when it really boils down to a bunch of crap.  I've fished all kinds of lines in all kinds of conditions and I find that in the WINTER nothing beats siglon F,  but raven fishes fine until the temp drops.  "

The guy who said that to me is a raven field tech /rep who is also a member of this board....But you new that already I am sure   ..thanks for calling your Raven Rep buddy and looking like a total idiot asking him such a question...LOL  Not only that, but one of his customers landed a 54lbs Chinook in Alaska using Raven Main Line - and any line that can take that kind of abuse has to be awesome! ..... I can drag in a dead Chinny on Raven too  I find it funny how things can get posted on the internet and be taken as the truth when it really boils down to a bunch of crap. I only speak the truth on this board, maybe with a little smack      sometimes but , never do I lie.....
