This cold forecast for the weekend has got me thinking about something that i did last season while it was really cold to keep my hand warm. I HATE fishing my pin with a glove on my rod hand, drives me nuts so I took one of those hand warmer packets that you put in your gloves and elastic banded it around the metal reel seat of my float rod. Heats the metal right up and takes the edge off the cold that numbs your fingers when your are out drifting on those questionable days.  I will be putting it to use tomorrow morning for sure...minus 8 yuck"
269988,kentooley,2008-11-21 00:54:00,208,Hey Kemper!  I was going to do the old cork on the backplate deal but I like your idea much better.  Thanx  Chris
270004,jdmls,2008-11-21 01:34:00,575, Did the cork thing last year...It keeps the fingers warm...but makes your pin look damn ugly !! I couldn't stand to look at it after half a day of fishing...I like my pretty gold reel
270011,KelfuN,2008-11-21 01:56:00,246,my buddy told me this idea and i might try that tomorrow morning.  slap on hockey tape or electrical tape on the backplate of your pin...so your palm isnt touching straight to metal.
