270301,buckster,2008-11-21 21:52:00,530,I took a walk around bps this afternoon to find some stuff on clearence.  You really gotta keep your eyes open for that red tag.  I got 2 api latter style tree stands regular $399 for only $99 each.  I also got a johnny morris 7' medium/heavy spinning rod reg $199 for $99.  I was close to buying the simms breathable wadders but i spent enough for the day lol.  Lots of other stuff.  You just gotta look around.  Savings in every department.  Even some guns!

270309,Wild,2008-11-21 22:13:00,704,Are the Shimano rods still on sale Buckster?
270313,buckster,2008-11-21 22:22:00,530,  I'm not sure.  Im not a fan of shimano rods so i didnt even look.  I took a look at the reels but no sales there!
270318,Rizzo,2008-11-21 22:39:00,4754,good to know. I'm stopping in there tonight to look for a (hopefully) 48 inch heavy duty wire leader. Banging bottom on the niagara is wreaking havoc on the flurocarbon!

270356,Mattones,2008-11-21 23:49:00,587,I gotta  stay away from BPS until the new year. Everytime i go i drop $250+
270372,bassjnkie,2008-11-22 00:24:00,1101,"Thanks for the heads up. Last time I went I bought nothing due to my Dad. I guess i will make up for it tomorrow, poor bank account.  Thanks Daniel"
270377,misfish,2008-11-22 00:29:00,29133, I make my own ladder stands. They suit me much better then the ones they sell.
270469,buckster,2008-11-22 03:32:00,530,  Yeah i guess they are simple enough to make.  But for $100 i couldn't pass them up.  Full padded seats.  They are pretty sweet! and light!
270506,Stern Rules,2008-11-22 06:42:00,342,Thanks for the info. I'm heading there in the morning.
270543,Wild,2008-11-22 13:45:00,704,Looking at the present and projected retail sale figures all stores are hurting so expect more items to be tagged with sale prices. Let us know what you find.
