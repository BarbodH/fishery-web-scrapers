270205,lew,2008-11-21 18:25:00,12767," Don't know where your located, but if it's anywhere near downtown Toronto, try Mountain Equipment Co-Op at King & Spadina  They specialize top of the line outdoor gear and their prices are excellent too."
270227,BillM,2008-11-21 19:15:00,17367,"Dave, Marks Work Wear House would be another place you could try... I am going to pick up some stuff from them this weekend before my little trip to the Geen on monday."
270232,Wild,2008-11-21 19:25:00,704,"Yes Marks has some socks they call 40 degree below which are similar to the Red Head ones I am wearing right now, not as good quality as BPS ones but the price is 20 bucks for 3 pair."
270275,Canuck2fan,2008-11-21 20:58:00,1444,If you really have to use hand/foot warmers buy the reuseable ones from Lee Valley. To reuse then all you do is wrap them in a cloth and put in boiling water for 10 minutes. They do about 50 charges or so and only cost 4.95 or so each. Heck of a product....
270017,jdmls,2008-11-21 02:03:00,575,"Help me out guys.... My feet freeze when I am out fishing this time of year, to a point where it forces me to stop fishing and walk around for 5-10 mins to warm them up again... I have tried thick socks , two pairs of socks, and even plastic bagging my feet before I put on my waders and nothing seems to keep them warm .... I know the whole feet warmer thing, but I am trying to figure out the best possible solution with socks that will keep me warm without having to spend money on the feet warmers every trip... Thanks Dave"

270025,dobee,2008-11-21 02:19:00,301,"i have orvis waders (bootfoot) 179 on sale... they came with thinsulate in the boots... i wear a thick pair of wool socks and these waders and i can stand waist high in water all day and be toasty warm...  before i got these waders i put a pack of the small hand warmers in each boot, kept me nice and warm also... other then that i was doing the same you are fish for 10, walk for 5 so on and so forth.....  good luck keeping warm"
270034,kentooley,2008-11-21 02:31:00,208,"BPS has inserts for your boots that hold those footwarmers. Other than that...polypropylene socks to wick away the moisture and wool socks over them ...keep your head covered and you should be fine. Polypropylene underwear ($80 at the army surplus). I fished 3-4 times a week all last winter without the footwarmers and I was just fine. You should know , I'm a maniac...waiting for the slush to melt in the morning and don't leave until sunset.  Cheers  PS. I wear breathables. Polypropylene underwear is the ticket!!  Chris"
270035,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-21 02:37:00,10439,The best thing in cold temps is oversize bootfoots (you don't want them tight at all) plus a wicking sock followed by a pair of Merino Wool socks.
270039,okumasheffield,2008-11-21 02:52:00,318,My secret trick: keep hooking into/fighting fish .. my feet stay harm for another hour or two after each fight ...
270042,Ramble,2008-11-21 02:55:00,713,"I hate cold feet. The wicking layer can be bery helpful as mentioned above. Air is teh key to insulation. Wool socks are a definate help, but alpaca fleese is warmer, and less itchy if that's any help. Try improving the insulation in the legs, and that should also help your feet. Stay away from cotton, and i find doubling socks does little for my foot warmth. Foot or hand warmers do help. I think in your case you might have to play around with products a little.  -R-"
270045,Dutch,2008-11-21 02:59:00,831,"You can have as much insulation/thinsulate around your foot as you want, but if the soles of the boots you are wearing aren't thick and don't provide insulation from the cold ground, your feet are going to be cold no matter what.  You need a good quality boot with as thick a sole as possible.  I remember awhile back looking at Kamic or Sorel boots.  The only real appreciable diffence between the -25 and -75 degree rated boots was the thickness of the sole of the boot."
270046,holdfast,2008-11-21 03:02:00,1813,Yup and Ill add one other thing.  KEEP MOVING YOUR TOES and feet if theyre cold. Trust me. excercise
270051,BillM,2008-11-21 03:20:00,17367,"Dave, I copied this from a post at GBO... "
270052,bigugli,2008-11-21 03:20:00,6138,"Do not put too many layers in yer boots. You take away air spaces in doing so and speed up the chill. I have an extra sole liner to thicken the insulation from below, and a double layer of wool socks. I stay toasty."

270064,tschirk,2008-11-21 04:55:00,261,I have been really impressed with Red Hat Lifetime merino wool socks @ Bass Pro - ~$15... Worth every penny!
270068,Guest skeeter99,2008-11-21 05:04:00,0,"sounds like your waders are too small IE. boot size  get a pair at least a size or 2 bigger and wear one pair of good wool socks, with the larger size boot the air will insulate better than anything with the warm sock, no air around foot means nothing to hold and trap the heat  found this out years ago and now never get cold feet  you can actually wear less of the right clothing in the correct configuration and be warmer than the guy all bundles up   ice fishing I only wear the cheap walmart rube socks with rubber insulated boots 1.5 sizes to big for my feet and never get cold"
270072,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-21 08:19:00,835,Pinch your Ol' Lady's leg warmers.. You know the ones that the girls wear in the workout videos. Warm blood in your legs keeps the rest of you warm.  tip # 2 Southern comfort and hot chocolate isn't half bad when its -40.  tip # 3 when the whiskey freezes its time to check your fingers and see if they are still there.
270085,splashhopper,2008-11-21 13:02:00,2931,"foot warmers duct taped to the bottom of the INNER sock only, and then a pair of wool socks.  I will spend the $1.50 everytime for 6/7 hours of PRIME fishing.  Think about it.... $0.20/ hr !    How much does your coffee cost and then you piss it out AFTER you are all bundled up!"
270096,douG,2008-11-21 13:48:00,2693,"I agree with the long cut and paste - start with two or three layers on your brain bucket, a toque, fleece hood, and the hood from your coat. As your body loses heat through your head, it is your extremities that get cold first, no matter what you are wearing on your feet and hands."
270097,super dave,2008-11-21 13:56:00,323,"I'll second the BPS hunting socks.  They are good with lots of cushion.  I still do get the cold feet but not as quick as I used to. Other tricks I'm going to try this year: Poly. socks, merino wool then neoprene socks.  May be too much bulk but we'll see.  Poly socks, merino wool socks then metalic insoles I see being sold at CT.  The idea is the shinny layer will reflect the heat back to your feet.  If these don't work, back to the foot warmers."
270101,Headhunter,2008-11-21 14:01:00,5703,"Be sure to remove the insoles of your boots EVERY TIME you complete a trip. It's amazing how much condensation accumulates in yer boats after only a few hours waring them. I always take out my insoles after every outing... a dry foot has a much better chance of staying warm, then a foot swimming in condensation. HH"
270108,troutologist,2008-11-21 14:19:00,951,"I wade year around and have no problem with my feet getting cold. I wear stocking foot breathables mostly but neoprene in the coldest temps.  First a pair of dress socks followed by a good pair of either burton snowboard socks or similar wool.  Best tip is when youre going to be fishing in an area for a while, loosen your wading boots right off, then tie em back tight when you need to hike to the next hole.  My hands are what limits the fishing time in the winter rivers...   Also by putting some cayenne pepper in your socks improves circulation to the feet...."
270115,super dave,2008-11-21 14:38:00,323,Another tip I once heard is to put on anti persperant on your feet to prevent them from sweating.  Wet feet = cold feet.

270189,Raf,2008-11-21 17:44:00,3495,"styrofoam insulates from the cold very well.  if you can squeeze a thin ""styro-sole"" into your boots, it will make a diff."
