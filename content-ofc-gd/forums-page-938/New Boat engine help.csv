269773,LeXXington,2008-11-20 15:46:00,1928,"Hi All:  Yes I am actually looking at upgrading my little 25Hp. The laughter was starting to give me a complex.  This is where OFC is the greatest resourse. Where have you bought you engine got the best service and price.  What I am looking for is a 40HP Merc, 4st 2009.  thanks"
269786,PERCHER,2008-11-20 16:34:00,787,Try a Yamaha you will love it.
269805,2 tone z71,2008-11-20 17:40:00,1311,Yep Yamaha or Suzuki 4 stroke you wont be buying another for a VERY long time
269810,SlowPoke,2008-11-20 17:57:00,2984,"Don't mess with the magic on ""Trophy Taker""!! June 2008 - Lakair WINNER November 2008 - Bay of Quinte WINNER July-August 2009 - GOSD WINNER?????  What's your boat rated for?"
269820,Flappn,2008-11-20 18:25:00,245,"I would give the Evinrude e-tec's a serious look. Weight is low, 2 stroke low end power, low maintenance, easy winterization and same fuel economy as the 4 strokes. They are a fantastic unit."
269840,2 tone z71,2008-11-20 19:21:00,1311,hahaha no no I cant say it  lol
269843,BITEME,2008-11-20 19:40:00,1969,Yamaha!!!!!!
269865,LeXXington,2008-11-20 20:50:00,1928," LOL, she may not be fast but she is lucky.  My model says Max 40hp.  With the kids getting older (6 and 2) + the Dog I might have too get the engine to get up on a plane.  Over the BOQ we could not get on a plane going into the wind..   we had too turn downwind to give us the little boost."
269879,2 tone z71,2008-11-20 21:17:00,1311,well if your loading her down heavy get a 50 60 hp max
269931,tizfun,2008-11-20 23:12:00,292,"I've owned them all... Merc, Yamaha, Johnson/Evinrude, Suzuki.. and by far the best has been the Yamaha !!!!!!!!!!!!  These were all 2 strokes and never had a problem with the 70hp and the 90hp I owned... From my personal experiences, I would go with the Yamaha ....  Over the past 15 years these are the motors that I have owned and ran.  All 2 stroke and some new and others not more than 2 years old when purchased..  70 Evinrude 25 Suzuki 15 Merc 30 Johnson 40 Johnson 50 Merc 50 Evinrude 70 Yamaha 15 Evinrude 35 Johnson 90 Yamaha  4 Yamaha 4 stk  Tiz"
269960,ecmilley,2008-11-21 00:11:00,2163,"with the build quality of todays engines being top notch, doesn't really matter whitch major brand you choose, from personnel expierance the merc 40 4str is a great little engine good on fuel smooth runner the only draw back i have seen is the friction adjustment on the tiller handle doesn't work to well, i would buy one if the faced with the choice, but yamaha, honda are excellant engines as well , the e-tec still having some reliability issues but there getting better with every year"
269962,Radnine,2008-11-21 00:16:00,1538,"Merc, 4 stroke. Magic."
269966,irishfield,2008-11-21 00:23:00,26272,I guess the first question Paul is whether the controls for the 25 will work on the 40... then it's a no brainer which brand to go with.
270048,bassmastermike,2008-11-21 03:13:00,295,MERC all the way Paul!!!!
270077,Greencoachdog,2008-11-21 12:14:00,8163,Uhhhhhh... I believe this is the question Lex would like answered:   He has decided on the brand and wants to know WHERE he can get a decent deal!!!  Sorry I can't help Lex... for obvious reasons.
270083,Sinker,2008-11-21 12:46:00,8692,"I'm not sure about prices, but Mclaren Marine in Lindsay has always provided GREAT service for me over years!! They're a merc dealer.  Sinker"
270091,Bitsmith2k,2008-11-21 13:30:00,396,i read a post recommending sal at discount marine a while ago.. so i dealt with him and would also recommend him..
270094,lew,2008-11-21 13:43:00,12767,"Boatland Canada on the 115 used to have about the cheapest prices anywhere,  so when I was looking to buy my motor, I shopped all over 1st and got the best price, then called Boatland last and gave him the lowest price I'd received and he instantely knocked another $400 off that price.  Unfortunately, his customer service took a nosedive a few years back and alot of guys turned against them, but I don't know how things are there now.  Might be worth a try Paul, but it's only a suggestion."
270100,PERCHER,2008-11-21 14:00:00,787,I heard that BPS has great prices on Mercury out boards.
270123,LeXXington,2008-11-21 15:02:00,1928,"Thanks all for the great advice,  The controls for my Merc will work with a 40hp Merc, with a small part  The new controler for a Yam is another $600 if the price was good I would switch when comparing the 2 its about 26lbs lighter.  So far, Basspro is the best deal I have found anywhere but they don't take trade-in.. apprently my 2003 is too old yet they are still selling 2006 on the shelf"
