In this day and age of poor customer service all over the place, I thought I'd take a moment and publicly give props to a company that has just done me some awesome customer service.  Over the Thanksgiving weekend while out fishing, I somehow managed to break the door that holds the spinnerbait box in my Plano 7771 box. I've had the box for over a year now, and it gets used regularly. I love the box, and hated the thought of having to replace the whole box or monkey something up on it just for the sake of one little door. I decided I'd contact the manufacturer to see if I could purchase just the door. I went on the website and fired off an email explaining what had happened and asking if there was a chance they'd sell me just the lid. I was expecting to get no reply or at best something along the lines of ""sorry, we only sell complete boxes, etc...."" I was very pleasantly surprised to get a reply back the next day telling me they were shipping me a new part free of charge. They didn't even charge me shipping!  I know it's a small part, and probably doesn't cost them a lot to make it, but if I'd had to buy a whole new box....  Anyways, buy Plano. They've demonstrated to me that they do care about their customers....."

Please give us your address so that we can send you a replacement!!""  I will NEVER buy any other tackle box other than from Plano!...Kudo's to them!!"
270572,mistyriver1,2008-11-22 15:07:00,600,That's good to hear.
