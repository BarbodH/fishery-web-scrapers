There's a nice small shallow lake that freezes up early I want to hit near Huntsville for perch/walleye, but if the snow's been heavy, I don't think I'll make the trip. Thanks!"

Just had a guy leave here that came down from Noelville to pick up some landing gear parts I built him..... they have basically nothing for accumulation there.
