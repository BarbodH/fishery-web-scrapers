With the soft water season coming to an end,, I'm finally going to take the time to join OFC which was highly recommended to me by my good friend and neighbour Leechman. I took a quick look through some of the reports Pretty impressive to say the least. ie some of those trout and salmon  reports ,, Very very nice .  Myself its been one of my best season's ever , like hooking into my first Muskie ever , somewhere around a 25lber ( thanks to that TroutnMuskiehunter Dude ) . Anyway to keep it short and sweet i'm looking forward to participating with the OFC Crew .  I'll post some pics when i get this computer flaw straightened out.   Got it fixed up now  LMB    Northern Pike    One caught on ice     Smallmouth      Hope you enjoy"
