269898,misfish,2008-11-20 21:57:00,29133,"Boy, for the time it took them to walk out and set that up,buddy could use some cardio. Talk about being out of breath after a couple of minutes.  I like the flip and fish type myself.  Thanks for the link Clamp."

269948,Fisherman,2008-11-20 23:49:00,7201,"Yep, need to be in shape and have a lot of patience, if you're alone trying to set one up, go on a calm day, otherwise you might be trying out the sport of catching a cover.  If the snows a bit deep, they don't float, they dig into the snow.   Best thing I did for mine..got rid of it. Now I have a flip over."
269993,ch312,2008-11-21 01:06:00,1590,"i have used a clam 2000 for 3 seasons but its a little smaller than the one in the video though.  mine is very easy to pull, even with aqua vu, bucket of minnows, heater, food/drinks, etc. if its digging into the snow you likely put all the weight on the front end. even in deep powder its easy to pull full loaded. its also very easy to setup, except when theres no snow on the ice and its very windy. takes less than a minute to erect the hut.  i made up a set of ABS pipe runners that prevent the bottom of the hut from wearing out when being pulled on roads and gravel. if theres interest, ill post pics of this great setup"
270177,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-21 17:02:00,2582, The video time was 4:16. With a flip shelter you would have already been fishing before the 2 minute mark. Also you won't be setting the CUBE up that quickly in a good wind.  Many people have them and are happy with them though. To each there own. For me it's a flip shelter all the way.
