To sum it up in short the fishing got better as the day went on, I even managed the smallest coho full of loose roe, it was an awesome day I went 5 for 9, froze my feet and hands off a little but caught some great fish. It's amazing how much less effort the steelhead put in when the water becomes this cold, mostly headshakes. To any of you who dont believe me, come and check my cellphone LMAO. All of my fish were caught on roe but I saw alot of guys tossing the pink worms around without any luck that I saw. All in all great day wish I had the energy to get out there today too,might have been even better. Those damn spinning reels are annoying me too many weak hooksets where the fish came off after a few seconds due to too much slack!"
