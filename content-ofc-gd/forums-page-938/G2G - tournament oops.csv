268492,LeXXington,2008-11-17 18:10:00,1928,Hi All:  I received a call from the Perfect Vue and apprently there was a trouphy left in our cabin #3.  I am guessing that my fish won the Qunity G2G     but unfortuantly we had already packed and left. Joanne has the trophy and is wondering how too get it too me.  Is anyone going near that can pick it up and bring it back too Mississauga/TO. I won't be out there till spring  Thanks  Lexx

270121,LeXXington,2008-11-21 14:47:00,1928,Just a bump in case someone is going out there that can bring it back into the city. Please call a head to let them know your coming. http://www.perfectvueresort.com/navigation.htm  If you have a boat you can also get too their location by Shermans Point.  Thanks all in advance.
