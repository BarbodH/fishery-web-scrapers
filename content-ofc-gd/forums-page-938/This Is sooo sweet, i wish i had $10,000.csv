269998,Wild,2008-11-21 01:18:00,704,Hope it comes with a snow plow cause you aren't going anywhere if snow is on the ground!
269999,bigredfisher,2008-11-21 01:23:00,300,"actually it is really good in the snow, check it out on you tube there was a guy driving one in 2 ft of snow"
270000,Beats,2008-11-21 01:24:00,543,"I've seen this and other similar things before.  It seems to me that whenever a product comes out that tries to incorporate too many things into one package, it's bound to fail.  Who knows, maybe this thing is great, but it just looks like its going for the ""cool factor"" over being practical.. The pic of the guy shooting out of it is a bit of a reach.  And the last pic makes it hard to tell if they were intending to drive on the ice or float in the water:)  Imagine that thing being frozen into the lake like that..   Just my opinion."
270001,jdmls,2008-11-21 01:28:00,575,PM Sly...He has the only one I have ever seen on Simcoe... He will probably take you out fishin with it if you ask him. Hopefully he is recovering well and we will get to see him on the hardwater this year..... SLY Chime in bud !!!

270050,Joey,2008-11-21 03:18:00,9122,"Sly said his did not do well in the thick, wet snow.  Neat craft tho.  Joey"
270090,johnnyb,2008-11-21 13:30:00,3413,That last pic looks like it's stuck.
270278,Canuck2fan,2008-11-21 21:03:00,1444,"Just slap a set of 16"" mudders on it and give er!!!! It does look cool but being stuck and keel hauling back to shore by hand would really tick me off if I dropped 10K on it LOL"
