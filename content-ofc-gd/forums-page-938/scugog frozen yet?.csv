269964,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-21 00:21:00,2582,I can not say for Scugog...but I did drive by Pidgeon around noon today and it was solid shore to shore south of  Gagnon narrows. Scugog typically freezes faster then Pidgeon. I would hazard a guess that Scugog will be solid enough by this weekend to ruin your hunting plans  Perhaps someone else can be more helpful. Good luck if you do get out though.
269967,johnnyb,2008-11-21 00:23:00,3413,I did hear on another forum that it's skimmed over pretty good...but try calling the local baitshops...they should know...
269968,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-21 00:24:00,3761,wow frozen already thats crazy.
270061,Sinker,2008-11-21 04:17:00,8692,"If this is any indication.......I'd say she's skimmed over pretty tight by now. Lake O might be your best bet!!  This was wed morning, but not on scugog.  "
270065,Guest skeeter99,2008-11-21 04:56:00,0,well it looks from the satellite photo taken today that from west shore to just past seven mile island to the mouth of kings bay is open and from ceasarea to the scugog river to ball point up the almost the crown land on the top of the island open still  but after tonite who knows and the next couple of days I reckon they will be crossing very quickly on snow machines  here is the link with the image for you to look at yourself   http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...io.143.250m.jpg  here is another earlier in the day  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...io.143.250m.jpg   Troy
270070,tizfun,2008-11-21 06:01:00,292,I drove by there tonight coming from the casino and it seemed to be frozen over all the way.. Everything looked all white..  Only opening was where everyone fishes from the shore.  Tiz
270076,ricoboxing,2008-11-21 12:14:00,398,thanks for the update. i guess i'll just take my chances and see if i can bust some skim ice. my 10 min paddle to the blind might take a bit longer though
270197,ScugogBoy,2008-11-21 18:06:00,36,I live on the east shore just below Scugog Point.......and as of 1:00pm this afternoon she is wide open.....I actually can see about 40 teal ducks out on the Lake in front of my place.....gotta go get the tinny ready and hopefully bring down some supper.
