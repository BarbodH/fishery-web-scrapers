270284,solopaddler,2008-11-21 21:20:00,8605,"Before I get to part 2 of the Manistee adventure, here's a couple of browns I caught today. Didn't fish for long, it was ccccold! My old bones can't take it anymore LOL! Numb finger, frozen toes, roe bags freezing solid if left exposed to the air for more than a couple minutes... Lots-o-fun!      Now the surprise bonus!  Hunched deep into my jacket with the hood up (no peripheral vision), I flicked my float across the river and just as it was about to drop, this guy flew into it:    What an epic battle  .  A nearby angler asked if I was fly fishing  .  After several knuckle dusting runs I managed to slide him onto the gravel... He then proceeded to PECK the c@#*p out of me when I tried to unhook him LOL!  A nearby angler came to my rescue and held the critter still while I performed the removal.    The little pecker (and I say that in the literal sense) then flew right out of the guys hands straight at my face!!  That was enough for me, shortly afterwards I packed up for home. Memorable outing though..  Cheers"
