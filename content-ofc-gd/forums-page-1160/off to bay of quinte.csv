105685,discophish,2007-08-21 03:03:00,392,I am fortunate to be invited to a friend of a friend's cottage on the BOQ in September.  I can't wait because it will be my first time on that water.  I was taking mental notes during last falls pickerel extravaganza around here.  Best of luck with great success!

105839,walleyedreamer,2007-08-21 17:33:00,101,"thanks guy. we do this every year at merland park. plus a second trip on the second week of November. trolling that time of year. this time it's cast cast the weed beds. and may be some trolling in around hay bay. my favorite spot is probably Keith shoal. last year at this time we had asked Kevin at merland park that it would be nice to have a deck. for cottage ten and by the second week of November it was build. just think a cold beer after a day of fishing on the deck. here the before and after picture of the deck. goes to show you how great Kevin and Jen are. and that's one of the reason i support Merland park. what more can you ask for. lol. just can wait , three days to go. happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer.  "
