I have one place in mind that I know I can catch fish no problem and my buddys are avid fishermen and also know the lake well but we are looking for something new. Walleye/smallmouth bass are the target species and a day of musky fishin wouldnt bother me at all either. We are willing to drive anywhere up to 2.5 hours from Whitby (45 mins east of toronto) and will need to rent a boat.  Ideas anyone?  thanks, kemper"
