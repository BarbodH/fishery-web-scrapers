105810,silveradosheriff,2007-08-21 16:16:00,1025,"Does the statement, ""We've  always done it like that"" ring any bells?   The US standard railroad  gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an  exceedingly odd number.   Why was that gauge used?  Because that's the way they built them in England, and English expatriates  built the US railroads.   Why did the English  build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same  people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they  used.   Why did ""they"" use that  gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs  and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel  spacing.   Why did the wagons have  that particular odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other  spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance  roads in England, because that's t he spacing of the wheel ruts.   So who built those old  rutted roads? Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe  (and England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.   And the ruts in the  roads? Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had  to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots  were made for Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel  spacing. Therefore the United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet,  8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial  Roman war chariot. B ureaucracies live forever.   So the next time you are  handed a Specification/ Procedure/ Process and wonder ""What horse's ass  came up with it?"" you may be exactly right. Imperial Roman army chariots  were made just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of the rear ends  of two war horses. (Two horses' asses.) Now, the twist to the story:   When you see a Space  Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets  attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket  boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory at Utah.  The engineers who designed the SR Bull would have preferred to make them a  bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to  the launch site. The railroad line >from the factory happens to run  through a tunnel in the mountains. And the SRBs had to fit through that  tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the  railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide as two horses' behinds.   So, a major Space  Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced  transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago by the  width of a horse's ass. And you thought being a horse's ass wasn't  important? Ancient horse's asses control almost everything.... and CURRENT  Horses Asses are controlling everything  else!!"
