105570,FishHeadRic,2007-08-20 22:55:00,226,"Hey Gang,  It's been a while since I've posted any reports so I figured now that I've moved back down here to Long Island, what better time to start posting again. It was a hectic move for me but now that the dust has settled I decided to reward myself by taking out the float boat and pickin' off some fluke. Fluke are Summer Flounder or Atlantic Halibut. They get upwards of 20lbs but the majority of them run in the 1 1/2 to 7lb range around these here parts.    This is the small harbour I fished in yesterday. It's about 5 min from my house on the north shore of L.I. To catch them you need to drift along and drag a hi-lo rig with a strip of squid and a shiner. Fluke are in every way predators. They lay on bottom waiting for anything to pass within range of striking distance. When something does they'll actually follow it for a bit or strike it right off the bat. Regulations down here have changed since I lived here before and now the fluke have to be 19.5"" to keep with a much shorter season then previously.    The only keeper of the day. She was 23"" and 2.5lbs. I caught 4 other shorts but that's fine by me. As long as I had something to bring home for supper!   When they're first born fluke look like all other fish with eyes on both sides of their heads. Eventually their eyes start to migrate over to one side and they start to swim sidways.   Only a face a mother could love!   I'm a size 9 1/2. Just to give you a referance as to how big it was.   Here's another referance pic with a lighter.   These fish have some serious teeth on them!   The one good thing about being flat is that they make for some of the easiest filletting fish I've ever had the pleasure to do.   YUMMMMM!  Of all the fish I've ever eaten Fluke has to be one of my favorite fish ever! Nice flakey white meat that's almost sweet. A lot of Japanese will eat these raw and I don't blame them! These are some tasty, tasty critters!  Anyways, I'm not going to be able to get out till the end of the week but when I do I think I'm gonna go after some stripers and bluefish. Hopefully I'll have another report for you all then!   Take care!  FishHeadRic"

105617,ecxstriper,2007-08-21 00:36:00,343,"nice Ric, I liker eating the blues more than the fluke ( I like my fish to taste Like fish). In New Jersey they have to be 17"" but it is changing to 17 1/2 "" next year, and there is no license for fishing tidal water"
105621,FishHeadRic,2007-08-21 00:44:00,226,"Thanks Gerrit, Roy, Mikeh and Rip. It has been a while since I've posted any reports. I've been fishing but have moved 3 times over the past couple of years and been working like a dog so... feels good to get another report out there.  I have been stoping in every once in a while to check out the reports but just haven't had the time to post. :/  Alex, I only like the cocktail blues. The bigger guys just taste like bunker to me...   FHR"
105631,Greencoachdog,2007-08-21 00:56:00,8163,"Great report and pics Ric! I love eating the Flounders too, but find most restaurants like to cook it with the skin on. I prefer mine skinless, the skin give the meat a kind of diesel fuel taste.... but without the skin it's pure heaven!!!"
105659,PatrickGG,2007-08-21 01:56:00,562,Good stuff Ric! and its good to hear everything is going good down in N.Y theres lots lakes to explore and fish in New York state hope you have alot of fun and i hope we soon see some more posts.

Patrick, There mostly salt water where I am right now but I know what you're saying about the lakes of New York State. It's truely a beautiful area! Crazyhook I wish it was a door matt.    That's a door matt!!!   FHR"
