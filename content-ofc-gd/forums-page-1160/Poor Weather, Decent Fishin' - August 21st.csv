My first fish was my first decent pike of 2007, great fight, lots of fun and a safe release. Those circle hooks work great, always hook em right in the corner of the jaw.    The next few fish were bass, quite a few half decent ones. My tactic was to wait for GB to lose one, then I moved in for the catch  :twisted:      Even GB caught a few today!    And yes... the WGSF finally makes his re-appearance in a BBR report. Sadly, I did not subdue this beast.  "
