It took us quite a while to get into some bass but couldn't find 1 pike. The bass were hitting out near Pottahawk and we managed about 10 fish. Nothing big just around the 12"" to 14"" mark.  After giving up trying to find pike we decided to head towards Port Rowan to check for some perch. We managed about 8 keepers but we had to head in for the night.  We decided the next morning to start off going for perch since the weather was looking very bad. We managed 62 keepers throwing about 20 back. Also had the usual sunfish and rockies. My buddy was able to catch a catfish with a live minnow 1 foot under the water in 10 feet. That was a first for us as you can tell from the pic. He is also the guy that managed to catch a sucker trolling for walleye.  We were off the water by noon because of how the weather was looking. It never got that bad but you really don't want it to out there.              "
