Can anyone give me some clues/links/maps. Or just let me know what type of fish there are in the lake so I know what to bring. Thanks very much   Mark"
105806,Jay T,2007-08-21 15:55:00,282,There are Bass and Pike in Vernon. Caught a few Bass and Pike there a few weeks ago. I used Top water for the most part.
