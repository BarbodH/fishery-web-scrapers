106110,dobee,2007-08-22 12:30:00,301,think im heading down saturday night..
106147,tonyb,2007-08-22 14:24:00,1637,There are no salmon in Lake Ontario  Maybe see you guys down there... Tony
106170,bucktail,2007-08-22 15:03:00,1857,Might want to wait a week as the SE wind has filled this end with warm water driving most fish offshore. As soon as we get a west wind they should be moving right back into the the rivermouth.
106196,tonyb,2007-08-22 15:36:00,1637,"Bucktail, I think the warm water plays much less of a role at this time of year.  The fish are getting ready for their spawning runs and have only 1 thing on their mind.  I think light penetration and water clarity are more important factors (eg. fish at night and work the mudlines for best success)  Tony"

106236,huntervasili,2007-08-22 18:04:00,1604,As I mentioned in another Post I was out last night and they were jumping around like mad... I got a couple strikes but no hook ups... might even head out today...
106242,sharper,2007-08-22 18:29:00,279,"Where is this pier exactly??? I would like to give it a try. Do you need a 10' plus rod for this? or will my 6'6"" medium action do ok?"
106284,mikeymikey,2007-08-22 20:34:00,376," It's just RIGHT AT the river mouth.  Nowhere special.  You do not need a 10'+ rod but longer rod than yours would help a lot.  Remember, these are BIG fish. I've personally have caught with my old 6'6"" rod but thought it was gonna snap in two.  I think it would be a good idea for you to invest in a 8'6"" ~ 10'0"" Medium or Medium Heavy rod would be a great thing!  BUT! most importantly, especially when fishing from piers you really do need a large net with long long long handle bar.  These piers are fairly high."
106288,mikeymikey,2007-08-22 20:38:00,376, Thanks for tip.
