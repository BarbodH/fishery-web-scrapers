105857,Whopper,2007-08-21 18:11:00,2174,"Just spent four days camping at Lakair and fishing the West Arm area of Lake Nipissing. Had a great time at Kevin & Leslie's place, top notch I tell ya. Spent the long weekend with some good people, Lew, Raf, JP, Cory & Heather, the whole Mistyriver family, Don & Ruth. Even had a visit from TJ & Monique.  Lew had posted last week on the state of affairs on the water ways and I'm a little disappointed in the behavior of other boaters, especially other so called fisherman on the West Arm, more than just a couple times had people run way to close to my boat and fishing area. The icing on the cake was a couple other fisherman running over a buoy marker I had sent out for a reference point for a drift and the final straw was idiot that thought it was alright to circle the buoy and try to take it out of the water until I yelled at him to leave it the f.... alone. I really don't understand what this guy was thinking??? I wonder if the same guy would have went out of his way to pick up a piece of trash?  Fishing was a little slow but picked up on our last day.  Whopper"

105969,solopaddler,2007-08-21 22:42:00,8605,"Hey Phil, sorry to hear about your troubles. Hopefully despite that you and your son had a good time!  cheers"
105970,Joey,2007-08-21 22:43:00,9122,Well sounds like you had a good time despite the idiots on the water Phil.  No pictures?  Joey
105973,OhioFisherman,2007-08-21 22:50:00,6623,"LOL Phil, I have had guys try to take my marker buoys also, no clue what they are thinking."
106011,Greencoachdog,2007-08-22 00:58:00,8163,"I thought ladies used marker bouys?... and where's all the fish porn??? I'm tellin ya, ya shoulda came up in June... we caught tons of fish!"
106024,Daplumma,2007-08-22 01:34:00,1961,Lose your camera Phil??I think Dawg and I got most of the fish out of the west arm in June.I was surprised they let you back into Canada after last year! Joe
106029,Deg,2007-08-22 01:42:00,51,Geez Phil ... how many times do I have to apologize for trying to take the dumb buoy?  I thought you were done with it as you hadn't caught anything anyways.
106086,motv8tr,2007-08-22 10:23:00,2587,"Hey Phil, sorry you didn't have more fun on the water, but I'm guessing you had a good time over all, especially with all the great people there to keep you company.  How did your son like it?  I had hoped to make it up Sat. or Sun but due to vehicle issues and having a house guest I just couldn't get up there   Hopefully I'll see you in June.  Oh ya, where are the pics???  Maureen"
106091,Terry,2007-08-22 10:39:00,14456,"yeah but even with the idiots, four days of fishing with good friends can't be beat"
106100,Whopper,2007-08-22 11:20:00,2174,"Sorry folks about the no pic report, I will post another with fish porn for sure.  Just to set the record straight my son and I had a GREAT time and we did catch some fish. I didn't let the idiots that don't respect other people on the water spoil our visit. I was just surprised of things that I witnessed came from other so called sportsman.  Again I appologize on misleading anyone into thinking we didn't have a good time because we had a great trip and will probably return in the future.  Cheers  Whopper"
106118,motv8tr,2007-08-22 13:02:00,2587," What do you mean ""probably""???  You darn well better return if ya know what's good for ya   Next June I think might be a good time for a return visit  Maureen"
106126,Beans,2007-08-22 13:28:00,3339,"Cory and Heather !!!...Gawd its been ages...if you're lurking...You've been missed...  Had the same sort of thing happen at Rice Lake Phil...First run after positioning our marker some yo-yo anchors right beside it...we pulled up close to retreive it when the guy asks...""do you boys catch much around here?""...I replied ""we do when some sum na B*TCH doesn't park near our marker...I'm about ready to give him a hit up the side of the head with our paddle when my son yells ""DAD...NO!!!""...They took off like they were on a jet ski...LOL"
