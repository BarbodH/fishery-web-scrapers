106255,Raf,2007-08-22 18:54:00,3495,angling specialties - dont have the exact address but they are at Central Pkwy and Confederation.
106257,addy79,2007-08-22 19:10:00,573,"thanks Jeff, would that be the same guy that does the reel repairs etc.?"
106267,douG,2007-08-22 19:41:00,2693,"No.  Reel repairs is Aikman's on Dundas west of hwy 10.  Bait is Angling Specialties.  And again, Raf is the guy you were thanking, don't know who Jeff is.  Hope this hleps."
106271,Raf,2007-08-22 19:54:00,3495,I think the fellow at Angling Specialties may repair reels as well.  Not positive.  I DO know he repairs rods (guides).
