Well, I've caught pretty much every fish of Ontario excluding Bowfin and ...and... well, I'm pretty sure thats the only one... oh ya, Sturgeon.  I've actually started gaining interest in Flyfishing and would like to extend my fishing experience by catching more river fish, in particular, Brook Trout.  I've never specifically hunted this fish, but I have landed a few in my time.  We've got one hanging on the wall in the basement that a butcher of a taxidermist stuffed for us... it measures over 18+ inches  So could anyone fill me in on some secret spots to fish for Brook's, pretty please! I know that giving away fishing spots is a touchy issue, but please fill a young fisherman in!  I dont keep fish, I do it for sport and bragging rights  Any information would be appreciated.  PM me if you dont want to tell everyone about a certain spot or two.  Merci mon amis!"
