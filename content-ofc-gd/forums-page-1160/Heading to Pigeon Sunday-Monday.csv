Move them deeper/shallow??  We are targetting walleye, bass and may even try for my first ski....  Thanks  Sherriff"

However, I find this time of year the fishing tends to naturally slow down for walleye, maybe its just me? And I can't believe you would defame Leonidas that way......actually, I howl everytime I see yer sig, haha.  I think that was from Electric Boogaloo movie.  Good ol break dancin days. Good luck Jeff."
