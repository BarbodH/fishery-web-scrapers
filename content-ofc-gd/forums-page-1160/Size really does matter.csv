105994,Roy,2007-08-21 23:37:00,13728,"Sorry Connie. Like I said it was a good thread. Unfortunately, cooler heads don't prevail in these situations. It's IS interesting though to see that the folks who are the most self righteous are the ones (usually) aiding and abetting."
106066,holdfast,2007-08-22 04:39:00,1813,Then maybe its time that we had a non fishing discussion section for us fisherman that like to talk about other things than what we or you caught today.  Roy what are you trying to do.  Win an award for cutting the most threads.
106079,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-22 07:50:00,621,"Connie,thanks for sharing this guy's mistake I am sure its a lesson many will pay further atttention in regards to regs Hope alls well and look forward to your Pike report,have a chap from England,never heard so much talk about 30 pound pike in my life,they look like Beluga's  I want one that big ,32 poundrrs,35 pounders,38 pounders,my God I need to catch one"
106092,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-22 10:52:00,0,"I'm just glad I learned about the forked tail thing!Now that I keep pickeral, I wouldn't want to get a ticket for being a 1/4 of an inch over.  oh and comparing drinking and driving that kills, to a fish that is a 1/4 of an inch over is a tad over the top. Lets say cops were giving tickets to people that sped 4 km an hour over or under. That would be brutal....  The guys that caught fish over their limit got what they deserved though. Thats a no no!"
106114,Fisherman,2007-08-22 12:50:00,7201,"Donny is only doing his job, however, I would question his sneekyness is wearing other non uniform clothes over his assigned work clothes."
106137,John,2007-08-22 14:12:00,2956, Most of us can overlook the occasional poop disturber on this board who seem to try to make up for their inadequacies...............  Great thread Connie.
106144,wolfville,2007-08-22 14:23:00,396,I really really hope whoever that CO is to come to my neck of woods for a week or two every year. That would save some nice fisheries from being destroyed but people fishing multiple rods and keeping everything (legal or not).  No comment on the particular incident about your buddy. If he got charged because the fish was indeed out of the range then let's say he is unlucky. He reacted professionally though I have to say. For the group keeping 31 more than allowed..... penalty was too light for them in my book.
106185,tonyb,2007-08-22 15:21:00,1637,"GCD, I'd go fishing with you anytime    lots of other good input in here too.  The point is, the law is the law, follow it and be respectful of the officers enforcing it and you'll never have a problem.  If you do, then it's a problem with the officer, and that is a whole different issue.  Tony"
105940,ADC,2007-08-21 21:52:00,82,"  I think I know what you are getting at but, there are ways around it and the situation must be looked at on a case by case basis... such as.   ""Im going to ask you to park your car, have a taxi pick you up and let you off with a warning. If you come back and try to drive within 2 hours, you will be arrested.""  Not too mention that the breath-alizers can be off by a point or so.   There is no reason that the guy should be fined $180 for a quater of an inch. That is rediculous.  Im 6foot but if Im on my tippy toes, Im 6'1.  So, should I be fined for fraud because my driver lic. says 6ft but its really 6'1 ????  At most, it should have been a warning and a request to surrender the fish. or maybe just kick the guy off the lake for the day.  He will learn his lesson and seems like the exact type of person who deserves a warning and not a fine. He was not abusing anything.  I think that the laws apply more for poachers and idiots and from the sound of it. A guy who obides by the laws and was over by a quarter inch doesnt deserve a $180 fine.  As for the poachers, thats a totally different ball game and they deserve the maximum fines etc.  Just remember guys, practice what you preach and the next time you J-walk, litter, swear, drink too much, spit, pee in the bush, let your car idol  yada yada yada.... expect a ticket because the law is the law and there are no excuses right?  I think these types of things need to be handled on a case by case basis and it really bothers me that this guy got the $180 fine for a quater of an inch.  Really, what was gained by the $180 fine?  Maybe there is a quota someone needed to fill?  Everyone needs a bit of slack once and a while.  thats just my 2 cents"
105951,canadianguy33,2007-08-21 22:12:00,121, I don't understand why this is so hard for some of you to grasp.  Punishing the people that try to abide by the law only denigrates the law and those who enforce the law.
105953,charlesn,2007-08-21 22:13:00,551,"A sharp lesson learned.  From watching the FLW television show Redfish tournaments, you see how important an eighth or sixteenth of an inch can be.  26.9"" is a keeper, 27"" is a throwback with $50,000 on the line.  I feel for the guy, bad luck to be sure.  Charles"
105957,2kj,2007-08-21 22:21:00,77,"A quarter inch does not make him a poacher, nor is someone driving 55k in a 50 a law breaking street racer. Donny is a dick, no doubt about it.  He is however a consistent dick and its kind of nice knowing that there is a CO motoring around with a hard-on for poachers!   Sometimes you get pulled over by a fair cop sometimes you don't.  Hey Donny if you are out there, feel free to chime in!"
105960,Roy,2007-08-21 22:25:00,13728,This was a good thread. Looks like it might be heading South soon.
105963,danbouck,2007-08-21 22:34:00,4380,  We are voicing our own opinions here. We do not need to be told that our opinion on this matter is WRONG! Please don't turn this thread into Lew's Boater thread. CG33 i'm pretty sure that if these replies keep coming Roy will close this thread. So let's just let people voice their opinions on this matter!
105966,solopaddler,2007-08-21 22:40:00,8605,"Soooo, how 'bout them Leafs?"
105967,danbouck,2007-08-21 22:41:00,4380,  Priceless  Well Done!
105975,TennesseeGuy,2007-08-21 22:53:00,957,"Thread was started to show that major violators are being punished and to inform members not to become careless as my friend did by not measuring a close fish.  The two fish that were over 18.1"" seemed small compared to other walleyes being caught that day.  Don't guess.  A few members found out about the tail pinch technique used in measuring fish.  Remember there was no intent by my friend to gain an advantage and he has no complaints about the $180 lesson.  He'll be heading back up north with me in about five weeks.  We'll be eating 15"" walleyes and releasing huge pike.  Lots of huge pike.  Donny may visit us during our stay and he'll be welcome in our cabin for a walleye dinner.  Another CO may have looked at the fish and not measured them, but this time they were measured and two were over.  1/4"" isn't much.  Certainly not enough to do me any good where I need it the most.       I still wouldn't be able to dunk a basketball."
105979,Gerritt,2007-08-21 23:04:00,6129,"  Thanks for the reply Connie...and I have to assume you need that 1/4"" in height?!?.. I am certainly hoping so!  Gerritt."
105985,canadianguy33,2007-08-21 23:16:00,121, We're on a discussion board my friend.
105990,muskymatt,2007-08-21 23:25:00,2608,Actually it's a fishing forum ...to post reports...share info...I noticed you have yet to make a fishing report CG33 in your 100 posts or 10 per day!!!!  More like an argument board  eh???
105778,rickster,2007-08-21 14:26:00,495,"Here is a copy of the mnr regs re size limits.   A variety of size restrictions apply to some species and waterbodies (see Map, A, B, C, D or E ). Unless otherwise stated, size limits refer to total length , which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with the tail fin lobes compressed to give the maximum possible length.  For some waterbodies, the regulation may specify a size limit that is a fork length . Fork length is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the central part of the tail fin (see below). If you catch a fish in a restricted size range, you must release it immediately. (See Tips on Live Release of Fish ).  Provincial regulations are established using the metric system. The conversion to inches has been rounded to one decimal place for the convenience of anglers.  You friend was in the wrong and I commend him for not complaining about it. Personally if I catch a walleye that is close to the slot limit I don't even hesitate to release it.  Just not worth the risk if you ask me. I have had nothing but good experiences with the COs in this area thankfully and I commend them for the job they do."
105787,BryonG,2007-08-21 14:44:00,52,Cops are cops.They think differently than the rest of us.Not that it is good or bad.that is just the way it is. People that do that type of job have a different view of the way things are supposed to work and we just have to understand that.
