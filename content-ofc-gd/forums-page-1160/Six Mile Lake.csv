My brother in-law, good friend Puckhead,  and my two boys are heading to Six Mile Provincial Park for an extra looong weekend.  Hoping to hook into some bass, pike, and with any luck perhaps even some walleye or whitefish.  Last year my younger son, 6 yrs at the time, outfished us all.  Little does he know what I have up my sleeve this year   .  Depending on how energetic we are feeling   , I want to hit Severn to see if we can tangle with those monster musky.  We have been looking forward to this trip since we headed back home from last years.  Post to follow when we get back, hopefully with plenty of pics."
