105462,misfish,2007-08-20 16:52:00,29133,"This weekend was a real learning experience.  Dealing with a major cold front before saturdays event that made the bite hard to find. As it has been all season I found fish and good spots to haul fish out of,but then comes 3 days of cold and wind.  Saturday was the 3rd of 4 tourneys held at Glouster Pool. The morning was cool and crisp.(Needed a touqe and mitts)LOL We had the 34 blast off spot,out of 79.We were set on heading to a spot that can at times be a community spot so I knew I had to have the 115 full out all the way to have a chance to get there before the next wave of 200/250 hp,s Half way I look back and to my surprise theres no one behind us,but there were a few in front,I could just see.LOL Cruise in the channel and right away start with the same presentation I had used for the prefish.(Prefish I located without stinging the fish,as before, I was stinging them and then not finding them come tourney time) With only 3 boats in the area,I thought we had a good chance to get some good fish. James first cast with a zarra gets a huge boil at the bait,but no hook up.Quickly follow with a wizzle worm and ,wham fish on. Small bucket pound and a half.Continue to work the deep weeds fish on,oh this is a nice one,,,,,STUPID PIKE.  Work a steep rock cliff drop where I had seen a respectable smallie but nothing. Head into a bay which was 4-8 ft deep,continue with top water and wizzles and spinner baits. Hit,run,STUPID PIKE. We managed another small bucket out of the bay. Fish were not active at all. Before leaving the channel we hit one last bay which was 10-15 ft with high weeds. James throws a tube and hits a 2+ bucket.Well were 4 hours in and only 3 fish. Seemed to be the trend for us this year.  Decide to go over to an island I know with deep weeds were I managed a few fish last year.A couple of dinks was all it would end up coughing up to us.While looking around I see this guy out trolling in the middle of the lake,and within 10 minutes he had landed 3 fish.Im thinking what the heck. Once he was out of the area I cruise over and find the water is 30ft. Hmmmmmmmm. Ok drop shot,lets give it a try. Seem to be right,we landed 4 fish,2 which made the well.No bigg,ns but that was our five. We continued to seach new areas. Figured what can we lose,if anything we will learn new spots to either fish or not.  The wind was a killer later in the afternoon.By around 1:30,I was on my last bit of juice from the deepcells. We finished the day letting the wind blow us around on Little lake,hopping jigs and tubes in deep weeds.One fish to be had,,,,,STUPID PIKE.  We head in for the wiegh in and it seemed we were not the only ones finding the bite tough. Some coming in with 1,2,3 fish limits.Although our wieght was low we worked our butts off for those five fish.  Entries for the day 79,we managed to finish 48. This day was a day of learning and staying focused in tough conditions.  Sunday  Wind is near nil,temps still a bit cool but nothing like the day before. Optimizm is in the area,well that was until I took the tarp of the boat and seen my dash light on. I went NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. How can this be  .Those that remember my drained battery report from last year,I now know how and what happen. I hardly ever use my bow and stern lights as it,s pretty much day light when we launch.Well Saturday I needed to use them as it was dark at 5am when we launched.Yep,removed the lights,but forgot to turn the switch off. Another lesson learned.  Anyways I quickly check for power by just giving the tilt/trim switch a flip.Yes power,that ya lord I say. Ok were good to go.Just run the boat full out to the top end of the lake and that should get the power back up to snuff.  This day we blast of 48,were in the second blast off heat. I watch to see whos going wher and most importantly,to where we are going. 40 boats go and only one heads to the area. Whew sweet. Ok second heat goes,I see one other boat head to the spot,but I know theres room for me,or I was going to make room.LOL  The start for us was awesome,to our surprise we had a five fish limit by 8:30.    There was about 9 pounds in there not alot but 5 in one hour and a bit was such a presure reliever. We seen fish all day at this spot,3-4-5 pounders.I HATE WHEN YOU CAN SEE THEM,CAUSE THEY CAN SEE YOU.  All the first five were on tubes and spinner baits. We continued to work the area for 4 hours with adding 2 fish just upsizing about a pound or so.Then the unmentionable happen   I could hear the pop from the bow.All of a sudden I dont hear the LIVEWELL pump  Go back check it no pump running,quickly check the fuse,thier ok.What I said cannot be said here.   I will tell you,it sure made me happy that when I first got my boat,I thought of this happening.As Terry can atest,I bought a small little bilge pump from Princes Auto. I built it into the live well.If anything else,I could still airate the well,I would just have to keep adding fresh water to it with my little pee bucket I have on board  .Ok were back in bussiness but it was getting a bit frustrating seeing the fish and them not hitting.Again we were in deep weeds. I decide we should take a quick tour to 3 other spots then head back and finish the day where we started.Maybe the fish would be settled down from us chasing them around. Hit another deep weed area where I have gotten smallies. Get there,theres 2 boats leaving.What ever,I have this theory,they may have been there,but maybe not the right bait.LOL Throw the tube around,getting little dinks.Keep throwing and finally a nice four pounder on.Quick jump,get the rod as deep into the water as possible to prevent another jump but wasnt enough,another jump and a break off. I beat myself up a bit on that one,not for long though.One thing I have learned you cant get down. We fished the area with little succes so decided to go back and finish the day where we started. A buddy of mine was fishing the same area,but had no problems sharing the area. It would seem we were working the same pattern,site fishing. We seen a nice group of 3-4 pounders swimming around. After about 6-8 pitch,s to them one grabbed and it was the smaller of the group.We cull our smallest and continue. See another group of 3,but they would hav nothing to do with us.  James asks if thats a pike swimming past us. With a good look,we can see the fork tail and it was a 3 ft long musky. First I had seen in Couch. Getting close to wiegh in I get a fish on,brief battle and break off.James throws and gets a fish on. Short battle and we land it.As he,s going to take the tube out,he looks at me and says look,it,s your tube.  .Sure enough it was. What a hungry bugger that fish was. By the end of the day we managed to cull 3 fish and of all the tourneys,this was our best outing. Saddly when we got to the wiegh in we had one dead fish.The one that had my tube down his gullit.It was only 15 minutes. This was my first dead fish in the two years I had fished. I was not happy with this and Im not sure what else I could of done. I knew there was a possibilty it could happen sometime. Not that it would of made a difference,but we got penalized one pound. That gave us 11.74 for the day and a 57th place finish out of 84.Lost 6 spots for that one pound.  All I got to say,like I have been since day one. I had a blast fishing,competeing and learning again. Met some new friends got to see some old, and to my partner James,thanks for the fun bud. Hope your first experience was enjoyable. I know you like the boat rides when it was hairy.LOL  Next is the FALL CHALLANGE which my son will be fishing with me,then there are a couple later fall one on SIMCOE. Other then that,I,ll be out on some new waters,as there has been a new lake or two added to the venue for next year."

105480,OhioFisherman,2007-08-20 17:58:00,6623,Great report Brian! LOL glad most of the lakes I fished here didn`t have pike!
105483,evster,2007-08-20 18:07:00,367,"Awesome report!  Tournament fishing sure is fun, definitely a learning experience every time out.  10 cent coin wash!!!  Man, I gotta find that one, got the GPS coordinates?"

105493,misfish,2007-08-20 18:40:00,29133,"I would just like to add a little something. Theres a couple pro angler members here. I got to see them at each tourney and I got to say.When I talk to them,they always had a smile on thier face weather it be before the blast off or at the end of the day. That is so much a possitive to me,no matter the out come of the day.  Dont mean to single them out but, Mark Kulick and David Chong,thanks for that.  It,s guys like you, that make guys like me,enjoy this sport of competitive fishing and want to come back.Even if it means you get my money.LOL  There are others that I want to thank,JPD,Charles Nahm,Rob(Spike) Brownridge,Les Culp,the list goes on.   Thanks again to all.  And to all those sponsors below."
105499,charlesn,2007-08-20 18:52:00,551,"You're way too happy Brian, please stop that.  lol j/k  Never beat yourself up for a lost fish or bad finish or whatever.  It's all fun and you'll remember even the worst of the worst times very fondly as time well spent with friends on the water.  Charles  P.S.  Thanks for your money at the recent clubbie, too bad you're missing your chance to take some back on a lake closer to you this Saturday."

105562,Mark Kulik,2007-08-20 22:12:00,348,"Thank-you for the kind words Brian, for me it's what it's all about, having fun! in the end it's all about fishing, the tourney part is never an easy go , keeping a positive mindset is the key, at Couch we had 12lbs at 1:30 -half an hour later we were at 18.40 lbs.   things change quick, . Nice to see you at the events Brian and glad you had a fun season! see you at the fall challenge! Mark"

105788,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 14:55:00,7971,"Brian...GREAT synopsis of your few days on the water.  It sounded pretty exciting to me!  I love reading your reports...they give out TONS of information for guys like me who know very little about bass fishing, although I am learning.  Between your posts, and others on the board, as well as a few OFNers who have taken me out bass fishing (basskicker and fishnsled), I've learned lots this year.  Who knows, maybe one of these days I'll enter one of those tournaments."
105927,Jeff R,2007-08-21 21:20:00,94,"Awesome read, thanks for sharing. Was almost like being in the boat fishing with you....Bit of a rough one, but to paraphrase    ""  Any hard day out in the water, is better than any good day filling out a timecard"".....Best of luck with the rest of the tournies   Jeff"
105946,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-21 22:03:00,0,Excellant report! Just curious... What were the winning weights on both waters and big fish???  I too had a hard time fishing gloucester this year and catching mostly pike!!!! There are actually 2 washing machines.lol Both decent spots.  That sucks that you were snapped off twice. What pound test were you using? You should check your line for frays more often!
105962,redx,2007-08-21 22:28:00,60,WOW NICE READ! Thank you for taking time and posting! More luck next time!

105980,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-08-21 23:05:00,0,"Thanks Brian. Man Gloucester pool is tougher than I thought! Some big names with small weights. The first time I fished gloucester(from a boat) I did very good on bass, fishing weedy humps! The next 2 times I did average but nailed some big pike. But I have caught really big bass from shore there so I know they are in there.  Couch I only fished once but we did well.  I wonder why Greg Klatt didn't do Gloucester? Would have been interesting to see what weight he brought in."
