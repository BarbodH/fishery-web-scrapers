105614,keram,2007-08-21 00:26:00,585,"Joey, which area of the lake ? I was there 3 weeks ago, fishing was ""so-so"", but I've learned few things I will be happy to share with you."

105644,Terry,2007-08-21 01:31:00,14456,"I think in french ""BBQ"" must mean something else  oh and can't help, don't know the lake"
105649,snagmaster,2007-08-21 01:37:00,250,fished the lake briefly...theres some good musky to be had . A spinner bait and a texas rigged plastic worm for largies produced some fish.. Caught a few  nice smallies on drop shots and tubes. Im sure you will get some nice fish..
105650,Joey,2007-08-21 01:42:00,9122,"Snagmasteral, thanks.  Is there any worry about rocks and such or is it a fairly clean lake as far as obstacles go?   Joey"
105667,discophish,2007-08-21 02:18:00,392,"I fished Baptiste and came up with nothing to mention about  ... of course that was no fault of the lake.  Just ours!  We marked huge schools of very large arcs, in many areas.  They are in there in big numbers, and large sizes, both pickerel and lakers.  Plenty of underwater structure for the bass and pike as well.  Good luck!"
105672,canadianguy33,2007-08-21 02:30:00,121,"A friend of the family has a cottage on Baptiste right down by ""the village"".  I was up there for the first time for a week in June and I thought the fishing was kind of brutal.   I mean, I guess it was okay in the evening, but really really tough during the day.  I caught about 10 pike, 0 muskie   and a about a half dozen walleyes and smallmouth for the week.  I'm not sure how busy it is this time of the year, but when I was up there, every night around 6-7pm about a dozen boats seemed to come out of nowhere and they'd all be hanging around on the NE side of Blueberry island (here's a map for reference).  That's where we caught the majority of our pike.  The word on the water was that the Ripples is the place to go to catch walleyes, but I only fished there once and didn't have any luck.  Hopefully, you'll have better luck than I did."
105694,John Bacon,2007-08-21 03:33:00,3277,There is actually more than one place on the lake that can be described as Lavalley Bay.  Lavalley Bay Cottages is located on the second bay to the east of Dog Bay; that may be the bay that you will be on.  The bay to the north west of Blueberry Island (see map link above) is also referred to as Lavalley Bay.  I have never actually seen the area labelled as Lavalley Bay on the map being referred to as Lavalley Bay before; we certainly don;t need a third Lavalley Bay on the lake.  There are only a few spots on the lake where rocks are concern.  Logs and stumps are much more common.  The predominant species in the lake are pike and rock bass.  There are also good numbers of large and small mouth bass.  Muskies were once plentiful but have declined since pike appeared in the lake.  Walleye and lake trout are more difficult to catch.  Keep in mind that there is both a slot limit and a shortened season for lake trout on the lake.  Dog Bay is a good spot for a variety of species.  The area between the mouths of the two narrow outlets at the back of the bay usually produce for me.  The rest of the bay has good spots as well.  The area around Blueberry Island is also good; especially near the two islands to the south west of Blueberry.  The entire area between the narrows by Hay Bay up the Ripples produces well.  If you see an Alumacraft with a 55hp Suzuki; that is my boat... my brother uses it too so it may not be me in it.  Good luck
105737,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 11:57:00,7971,"Good luck Joey!  As you know, I have NO useful knowledge when it comes to any lake that is north of Lake Ontario and anywhere more than about a 100 yards off the shore of Lake Ontario....LOL.  You'll get into some fish I'm sure!"
105785,bbog,2007-08-21 14:38:00,665,"Hi Joey,  Several years ago I cruised through Baptiste on a watercraft with very little draught and was still concerned about the many logs and stumps. I wasn't fishing back then but would think it was a structure fishing paradise. Good luck and let us know how you did.  Barn"
105798,Greencoachdog,2007-08-21 15:18:00,8163,Watch out for those damned suspended fish!!!
