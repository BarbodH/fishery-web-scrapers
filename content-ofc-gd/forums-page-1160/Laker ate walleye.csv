105774,Tomcat,2007-08-21 14:19:00,395,"Six of us ventured into north western Quebec 11-17 Aug for some walleye and lake trout fishing. One of my colleagues landed this real nice 12 pound laker.   However, much to his surprise, when he opened the lakers mouth to remove the hooks, he was staring at the tail of a 16 inch walleye (that's all that was left whole) attached to the entire intact backbone.   During the same trip, I was lucky enough to see a Black Bear with 3 cubs - a rarity to see for sure. Sorry that the pic isn't in complete focus. I was out at 12 X optical in a moving boat. "
105776,Roy,2007-08-21 14:21:00,13728,Beauty shot Tomcat. I hope that that walleye didn't put him over his limit.
105779,ccmtcanada,2007-08-21 14:28:00,7971,"Was the walleye in the slot?? haha.  Great story and picture!  So when you weigh that one, is it one fish or two?  Thanks for posting!"

106020,selcram,2007-08-22 01:26:00,26,"Double header!!   That's one fish with the munchies..  Not even done the first meal and already after a snack!!   Good job, beautiful trout."

106089,turtle,2007-08-22 10:29:00,274,"On the cottage lake I am on the larger lake trout (26 in + and 4-5lbs plus) eat smallmouth, rock bass and smaller lakers. A friend kept a larger trout and it had three rock bass (small ones) in it."
106090,motv8tr,2007-08-22 10:34:00,2587,"Well now, that was a hungry fish, or your friend just irritated it with the lure  .  Great pics though, thanks for sharing  Maureen"
106221,fishboy,2007-08-22 17:22:00,550,that's cool-wouldn't it be interesting for a ruling if it were for a tournament?
106361,fishindevil,2007-08-22 23:18:00,6254,"GREAT DISCOVERY !!!!!!!   i have known that lakers ate walleyes,but i have never seen any while i have been cleaning trout,but people i know have....so to acually see a walleyes tail sticking out of that lakers mouth is so cool.....it goes to show you that lakers will hit big,big lures when presented right....thanks for showing us that,oh ya nice laker as well.  ...great colors on him too....cheers"
