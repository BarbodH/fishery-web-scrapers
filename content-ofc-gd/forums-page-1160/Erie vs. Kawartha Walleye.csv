104373,Tacklebuster,2007-08-16 17:06:00,303,"with all the hot action on Erie, and having never fished it before, I was just wondering if they are as good tasting as Kawartha Walleye"
104398,Smokey,2007-08-16 18:44:00,1278,Personally I like them both but perfer the smaller ones that are readily available in the Kawarthas. I have a hard time catching them small enough for my liking in Erie.
104402,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-08-16 19:04:00,115,"I'd rather eat kawartha walleye for sure, almost like eating fresh berries or ones you find in the trash  That said, i won't turn down either"
104447,bbog,2007-08-16 20:44:00,665,sometimes smaller is better
104472,Greencoachdog,2007-08-17 00:28:00,8163,They all taste like crap... throw them back!
104518,ecxstriper,2007-08-17 03:06:00,343,The ones on my plate are the best tasting I've ever had
104565,OhioFisherman,2007-08-17 12:16:00,6623,Real hard to beat a Mcdonalds filet!
104792,ecmilley,2007-08-17 22:18:00,2163,since I have to walk about 50 ft to catch kawartha eyes and drive several hours for ERie ones I'll pick kawartha
104805,bucktail,2007-08-17 23:23:00,1857,"Just finished a plate of Erie eyes from last week , all about 3 pounds. No difference, both are awesome! Whichever is closer...but erie can take the pressure better"
104825,fishindevil,2007-08-18 00:10:00,6254,"well i think that the kawartha walleyes taste better than erie,or lake ontario walleyes because ,the great lakes walleyes eat alot of alewifes,and shad,which are very oily   ,as the kawarthas walleyes dont have that in their diet,and are not oily at all,and so these walleyes eat alot of perch   so they are for sure better tasting than the great lakes walleyes....cheers"
104829,Sinker,2007-08-18 00:17:00,8692,"  BINGO!!  I like my pickeral between 12-16"".....anyhting bigger is just not the same.  SInker"
104918,pikehunter,2007-08-18 11:41:00,1659," Are you referring to the Mystery fish? LOL  They used to call Mc's Fillet-O- Fish North Atlantic Whitefish....or in simpler terms, Cod.  With the Cod stocks down who the hell knows what they are using now  As for which walleye tastes better, I'd say the ones that are known as Pickerel"
104920,ilario,2007-08-18 11:46:00,166,i can't tell the diff  walleye are overrated! i  like pike!!
104948,northwood,2007-08-18 15:54:00,63,Lake erie is polluted... lake ontario is polluted.... the kaworthas are polluted... 
106237,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-22 18:12:00,698,I like the ones I catch  Also Mcdonalds uses Hoki fish instead of Cod for the Fillet-o-fish
