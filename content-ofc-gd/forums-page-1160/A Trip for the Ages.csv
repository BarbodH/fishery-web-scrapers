104836,SlowPoke,2007-08-18 00:52:00,2984,"Alright, now that's just rubbing our noses in it! LOL Outstanding report!! Isn't it amusing that on a great trip all those mishaps and breakdowns are a mere inconvenience. On a bad trip all those mishaps and breakdowns lead to therapy sessions.  -Brian"
104915,solopaddler,2007-08-18 11:07:00,8605,Just now had time to sit down and read your report. Thanks for posting that was a great read!

104960,Tony,2007-08-18 16:36:00,2,"Now that I'm finally caught up at home and work (and my body has recovered) after 2 weeks of hardcore fishing, I have to send out a couple of thank you's......  Marc...we had GREAT time with you and I can honestly say that I learned more in 3 days with you than I ever could have imagined (trolling techniques, working and tuning jerkbaits, daily lunar periods, etc.). The size and numbers of muskies you put us on was incredible and has to be seen to be believed. You truly are a MASTER of your craft.  Roy and J...I can't thank you enough for the OUTSTANDING meal and hospitality! Everything was first rate and you two really went above and beyond! It was great seeing you again and I look forward to meeting up again sooner than later!!  As Marty said, it really was a trip for the ages! Big fish and lots of fish. Great memories with family and friends...even with the minor mechanical problems. I dropped of the boat this morning to get an estimate on the damage to the motor. It has a broken and bent skeg, the stainless prop is bent and scraped, and it appears that the propeller shaft is slightly bent. Oh well...I guess that's what insurance is for. It was worth it anyway after a trip like we had!!!  Now the hard part....waiting another full year until we get the chance to head north again!  Tony"
104970,Mike the Pike,2007-08-18 17:55:00,3421,"Now that was an awesome report thanks for taking the time to put it all together .Congrats to your Dad for catching the 55"" ski and to Marc for puting you on some great fish.  MTP"
105117,Spiel,2007-08-19 12:22:00,9065,".....Super spectacular. Now that's the kind of thing I'd have loved over a bachelor party, either time! Despite the few mishaps yous had a great time and got home safe. Wish I'd have seen you on the way through. Praps you could schedule your highway troubles closeer to my place, like last year."

106078,Marc Thorpe,2007-08-22 07:46:00,621,"Tony and Marty and Ed in closing I leave you on these words by Green Day of course  Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test, and don't ask why It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life."

Nice photo's and your ""story"" has made me and the kids sleepy.  You should have been a writer.  Call Lenny and see what the deal is on that motor if you haven't already."
