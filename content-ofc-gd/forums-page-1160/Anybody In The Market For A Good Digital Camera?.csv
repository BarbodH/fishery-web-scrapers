103820,Photoz,2007-08-14 20:57:00,792,"Business Depot / Staples still have a few still-in-the-sealed-box Sony DSC H2 digital cameras laying around . . .     asking price $329.00 & they will match Henry's price, less 10% on the 2 gig memory stick . . .     $49.50. I know a few of you guys jumped all over these cameras when Future Shop had 'em for about $50.00 more last year. Great zoom ratio . .     12X = 35mm equivalent of a 36 to 432mm . . . .     or just consider you can count nose hairs at about 100'! I just picked up one today . ..    just a few pennies shy of $400.00, with taxes. Should have a few examples by next week to post.  Here's the camera info & review . . .   .     http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022509sonydsch5.asp"

103828,Roy,2007-08-14 21:44:00,13728,"Yup, that's the one I have Steve. Good camera...bad photographer..... You'll really like that cam."
103845,Deano,2007-08-14 23:30:00,767,"Have that camera also, but I didn't pay that low price. I would jump on that price knowing what I know now. Great camera."

My how the prices go down so fast.  Just a couple of years ago I spent double that for a 3mp, 5x digital zoom cybershot.  12x optical zoom with a Carl Zeiss lens is pretty impressive for that price."
