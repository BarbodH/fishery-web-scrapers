105123,Benthook,2007-08-19 12:41:00,56,I guess this is one way to catch a fish...strange but effective in this case~! lol  http://www.whoneedstelevision.com/?video_id=15386&pg=1
105128,smokinall4s,2007-08-19 13:07:00,89,"Different, but it seems to work. Good thing she had a boat."
105132,Rich Clemens,2007-08-19 13:23:00,3131,Now why am I spending all this money on fishing equipment ?
105135,aplumma,2007-08-19 13:26:00,6896,I am not sure that jug fishing should be thought of as strange. It is actually a popular way to catch fish down here in the states.   Art
105138,Benthook,2007-08-19 13:43:00,56,I think I'll stick to a rod and real myself...call me crazy~! lol
105139,Greencoachdog,2007-08-19 13:55:00,8163,"Gives a new meaning to the term ""Jug"" fishin'!!!"
105140,Rich Clemens,2007-08-19 14:01:00,3131,"I'll bet she had one of those infamous ""sabiki' rigs on them bottles."
105143,mcallister.grant,2007-08-19 14:12:00,327,Cool video. Some people have very different methods when it comes to fishing!
105151,OhioFisherman,2007-08-19 14:23:00,6623,"I have seen them do it here for catfish, LOL bigger jug though, usually like a 1 gallon white bleach bottle."
105176,TJQ,2007-08-19 16:08:00,7806,I hope that was their first date... if so that boy better marry her!!!
105181,redx,2007-08-19 17:24:00,60,"Nice gar! I hope they let it go with out hurting it. I was told that few people will kill or damage some gars so that they will die, in the Usa."
105183,easton13th,2007-08-19 17:40:00,371,"Interesting for sure! I would love to catch a gar that big! I would try rod and reel and that method, why not?  Easton"
105304,Daplumma,2007-08-20 00:51:00,1961,When I was young in the swamps  it was what you did to gars.The Alligator gars get really big and eat all of the game fish.As soon as you saw a gar the fish stopped biting and that was it.Any gar that was caught was killed.Dont know how they do it now. Joe
105316,fishindevil,2007-08-20 01:16:00,6254,Well thats different for sure..!!!!!!!
105322,Carp,2007-08-20 01:26:00,1488,Cool.
106226,fishboy,2007-08-22 17:32:00,550,Looks to me like just a variation on float fishing.
