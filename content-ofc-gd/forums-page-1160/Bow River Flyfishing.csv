He did most of the rowing and I did most of the fishing. Although we stopped periodically and I let him have first cast on some fishy looking water, it's tough to brag I outfished him, when he didn't fish much. The Bow is an awesome fishery and if you get to Calgary, you have to check it out. I hope the pics work...  All these were caught on the trusty golden stonefly.             We had a lot of hookups and were broken off by some brutes as well! Cheers suds   "
