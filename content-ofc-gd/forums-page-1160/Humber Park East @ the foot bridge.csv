Set up coopdog with a floating jig/worm and a linesplitter w/weight.  He got on the board first a nice catfish... HIS FIRST OFFICIAL CATCH IN CANADA!  Ilikefish invested in a fresh spool of POWERPRO ( 20lb ). I showed him how to spool the line.  Since he was going to float fish, I suggested he toss on a heavy spoon, cast it out and ""settle"" the line.  He tosses out a suggested 20 yard cast and retrieves.. no problem.  I tell him to whip it out ""there"" and he cranks one out.  BOOM he has a fish ( his first game fish ) on... and it has some size!  I showed him how to use the drag on his reel and he fought it for a good 3-4 minutes.  We finally see the fish... a 4-5 lb pike. Not to long but beefy. He took the spoon out a few times. Ilikefish was very happy.  We got it up for the catch and release, but, he popped his head and the lure popped out.... he was sad... i always think of that as an easy release ( no smelly pike grease ).  I followed up with 2 catfish.  These guys are on to worms now.....  Enjoy!"
106073,FishHeadRic,2007-08-22 07:21:00,226,Nice Report G-force! If you want more pike try the waters just east of the mouth where they put in that new deck in all the way to OP. They'll be out on those flats. Just look for any green weeds growing up and concentrate on those areas.  FHR
106256,sharper,2007-08-22 19:04:00,279,I enjoy fishing at Humber Bay park as well. Anyone ever caught any fish in those 3 ponds surrounded by the wooden broadwalk??? I caught a perch and saw carp in there.
106268,Anatz,2007-08-22 19:47:00,74,"those 3 ponds look pretty gross. Every time I go there, I always picture all the waste from the washroom ends up in there lol =]"

106299,highdrifter,2007-08-22 21:08:00,2534," True.  The smell is pretty rank...  Not far from what you'd call a sesspool!!  I pass through there on the way to the park... I see people in their lawn chairs in those pools, seems like they're imune to the smell!!"
