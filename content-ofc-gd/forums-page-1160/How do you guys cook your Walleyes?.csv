Anyways, I was wondering if any of you have any tasty and unusual ways of cooking your eyes.  I usually just batter them up and throw them in oil, but I think a change would be nice so any recommendations would be greatly appreciated."

Thx Gerritt Another recipe my dad was telling me about was to spread some Presidents Choice seafood spice on the fish, let it marinade in some white wine for a few hours, then either cook them up on a pan in the marinade or use oil.  I have tried this recipe on salmon, which turns out awesome, haven't tried it on walleye though."
105939,canadianguy33,2007-08-21 21:48:00,121,"Thanks for the link Gerritt.  That certainly is an unusual way to cook 'em, but I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to combine clam juice and bacon. lol"
105993,radar,2007-08-21 23:34:00,138,Salt and Pepper Dust em with a little flour (maybe paprika in here) Olive oil and butter in a fairly hot pan (and don't be shy with this) Fry em up brown little lemon on the side.  oh yeah!! Real walleye flavour.  That and Fish Crisp original and Gerrit's batter are my top three.
105996,canadianguy33,2007-08-21 23:41:00,121,"I came across this honey & crackers recipe and it sounds kind of unusual.  I think I'll give this one a go since I love honey.  from this site Uncle Bob’s Honey Dip Walleye  Ingredients 8 walleye fillets 2/3 cup vegetable oil 1 egg beaten 1 tbl honey ¼ cup of flour ½ tsp sea salt Pepper to taste Cracker crumbs or bread crumbs  Wash and dry the fillets. Heat the oil in a skillet at least 10 inches. Beat the egg and mix in the honey. Combine cracker or bread crumbs with flour, salt and pepper to taste. Dip fillets in egg mixture and coat with cracker/bread mix. Fry until golden brown (about 3 minutes per side) or fillet easily flakes. Serve with lemon wedge. then coat with cracker mixture. Fry until golden brown about 3 minutes each side. Serves 6-8"
106000,bbog,2007-08-22 00:01:00,665,Uncle Bob's recipe looks like a winner when I have more at my disposal than Original Fish Crisp.
106008,Big Al,2007-08-22 00:44:00,10,"1-Start with a nice fire that will give you a nice bed of coals 2-Cut up some pieces of foil big enough to wrap your fillets 3-In the middle of the foil spread some butter the size of your fillet 4-Place a fillet skin off, back against the butter 5-In a bowl mix some diced tomatoes, lemon juice, chopped onin and season to your taste buds 6-Place a nice layer of the mixer on the fillet 7-Wrap your fillet with the foil and double your foil. (Don't be affraid of using lots of foil, I usually have 4 layers of foil per side) 8-Once your fire becomes a bed of coals trow in the packs and flip after 15 minutes, cook for an other 15 minutes. 9-ENJOY!!   Hope this help, P.S. no dishes to wash"
106025,wallyboss,2007-08-22 01:38:00,1095,marinate walleye strips in Louisiana Hot Sauce for 2 hours.  Then take 1 cup of flour and 1 cup cornmeal mix together take strips from marinade and drip dry then put in flour mixture then deep fry.  Enjoy with a couple of cold ones!!!
106041,Joey,2007-08-22 02:48:00,9122,"Radar, that's exactly how we cook ours and it is delicious.  You can really taste the sweet pickerel flavour that way  And DON'T forget the cheeks  Joey"
106057,trapshooter,2007-08-22 03:50:00,1234,Wrap the walleye fillets length wise with a piece of bacon.  Secure with a toothpick and deep fry.  Drizzle or dip in honey.
