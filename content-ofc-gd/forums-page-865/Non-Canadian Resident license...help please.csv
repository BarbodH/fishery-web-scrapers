Looks like he's only going to be able to fish for one day.  Looking at the licenses on the mnr site it says something along the lines of  One-Day Sport Fishing Licence (Great Lakes and connecting waters including Lake St. Clair, Rondeau Bay, St. Lawrence River and Lake St. Francis)  Will this license include fishing small lakes up in the muskoka area???  If not, what type of license should I be looking for.     Cheers Tanner"
329975,Dnthmn,2009-04-14 15:33:00,128,Only way to be sure would be to call a local office and ask. For the few extra bucks you might want to consider the 8 day option. Then if you get a chance to go out again during his visit you'll be covered as well.
329988,hirk,2009-04-14 16:12:00,571,No the 1 day Great lakes is not valid in Muskoka.He needs the 8 day sport $43.50 or the 8 day conservation $25.25.I am an issuer so this info is 100% correct.
