Here's a few candidates for potential future fishing vehicles. Since they're all one-of-a-kind concepts at this point, I have no idea of pricing or towing capacity for any of them.  First up, Chevy G-Pix:   Chrysler's revised Town & Country concept:   Remember the old Dodge Rampage from the early 80s? It's back!   Honda has a funky hatchback concept called the ReMix:   New Jeep Renegade concept:   New SUV proposed by Kia, called the Mesa:   Wicked looking SUV concept from Mazda, called the Hakaze:   Suzuki X-6 concept:   And finally, two shots of Toyota's A-Bat, with its bizarre rear drawer:    Most of the time concept cars don't go anywhere, but every now and then they do make it to the street. Interesting to see if any of these wind up in our driveways one day.  I've seen the future ... and it looks like a silver egg!"
330038,charlied,2009-04-14 19:19:00,584,I really like the Dodge Rampage....but would be afraid of the price of it...LOL
330060,Roy,2009-04-14 20:41:00,13728,WOW!  I suppose those come with electric brakes for when they have to haul 12' tinnies?
330082,craigdritchie,2009-04-14 21:52:00,1586,"Actually that Kia is designed to be a replacement for their current Borrego SUV, which has a V8 and tows 6,500 pounds. The Dodge and the Toyota are supposed to be designed for towing as well."
330098,solopaddler,2009-04-14 22:24:00,8605,Is it just me or do most newer SUV's these ones included look like giant suppositories?
330111,Greencoachdog,2009-04-14 22:45:00,8163,"They look like Boar Hog teats to me!... but what does an ol' retnek know aboot the refined urban lifestyle eh?  ... if it can't handle a 2000 lb payload, I don't have much use for it!"
330126,bigugli,2009-04-14 23:22:00,6138,Looks like they simply enlarged the body designs of some earlier HotWheels toys
330129,kickingfrog,2009-04-14 23:29:00,8333,  2000lb payload??? Dawg your   ain't nearly that big.
