I wanted to make sure you got yours and it sounds like we are all going to meet up for breakfast and even do some car pooling. Please PM John for the details of where we are going to have breakfast and what time (somewhere around Burlington I think) and even if you can't join us for that, confirm that you got all the details regarding the trip.  Cliff  Home phone 705-328-0750 Cell 705-928-8899  Just in case you have any questions or I can be of any help."
