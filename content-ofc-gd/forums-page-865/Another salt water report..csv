The weather down there this year has been pretty cold, when we landed in Florida on Tuesday it was 60 degrees   The water was also extremely dirty compared to what is was the last time I was down there.  None the less the oldman and I made it out to our fav spot (Honeymoon Island State Park) and tried our best.   First couple of days netted us nothing but small grunts and blue runners.  We did find some rocks and the oldman hooked into a few small sheephead..     These fish have some wicked teeth, used to crush the shells of their food.  Keep your fingers away..  The last day of our trip and there was a good 20mph SW wind that pushed in the warmer water and the fish.  We pretty much hammered ladyfish and whitings the entire day.  I did get a bonus pompano and my oldman got a jack about 3-4lbs.  That took a good 20 mins to bring in   Along with the ladies and whitings, we picked up some spanish mackerel.  I was bit off twice by something that had a lot of weight, my guess was either a big mackerel or a bonnethead shark.  Caught two of them last year, but no sharks this year unfortunately.       Although the warm water was nice and getting a tan was even better, I'm ready to get back to steelhead slaying."
