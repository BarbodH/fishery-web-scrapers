330052,Lunker777,2009-04-14 20:14:00,866," Umm.... Have you never been to the Detroit river ? Its about half - 3 quarters of a kilometer wide. And it HAS a current ! haha A STRONG CURRENT !  I dont know fly fishing, so maybe there is places you can float fish... but I doubt it !"
330058,Paully,2009-04-14 20:31:00,712,I've seen stuff floating in it... but that about it.
330083,outllaw,2009-04-14 21:53:00,1232,"the detroit river has strong currents and spring flow. you would be better casting a jig and twister for walleyes . live bait is an option also. theres plenty of parkland to fish from.monnows would be the key. also you could try some canals for panfish with floats. awesome for gills, crappies, pike."
330087,charlied,2009-04-14 21:57:00,584,"Nope never been near the Detroit river, that would be why I asked!"
330142,watertight,2009-04-14 23:50:00,50,"What outlaw said. There is public parkland just east of the Ambassador Bridge and Wallys Bait is on Sandwich St. just west of the bridge, but the Canadian side of the river is very dirty right now. The better fishing has been on the American side but you need a Michigan license for that. Hopefully our side will clean up soon."
