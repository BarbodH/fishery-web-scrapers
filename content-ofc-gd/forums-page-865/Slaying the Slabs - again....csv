Water level was down, only 2 perch and a LM bass...  :? !!!So I changed to a different spot that looked promising - haven't fished it before for slabs... Fish on!!! This time I hit PAYDIRT... the slabs are a bit larger than at my prev spot, and man were they ON FIRE!!  Dinnerplate Slabs  12.5"" SLAB  10 keepers, as well as the requisite Perch for garnish  ...  Had a great time - Slaying the Slabs... looking fwd to the dinner bell... A few tips For anyone who hasn't caught crappie yet - here's a couple of tips...get your boat anchored near an inflow in shallow water (6-8'). Drop anchor - toss out the jig under a bobber... ideally near structure. Tug - stop - wait - tug - stop - wait - hey - bobber is moving sideways - Sweep set the hook - repeat...  O4T "
