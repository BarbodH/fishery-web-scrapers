330160,PERCHER,2009-04-15 01:01:00,787,"Phoenix Suns forward Amare Stoudemire missed practice Thursday with a partially torn iris after being poked in the eye during practice Wednesday.    Stoudemire Stoudemire, who returned to McKale Center on Friday night, said he wouldn't be able to exercise for another five to 10 days because of the injury.  ""I can't catch a break,"" Stoudemire told the Arizona Republic. ""I can't get my heart rate up because my blood pressure rises and it goes to my eye. I don't want that or the eye will bleed.""     Suns center Boris Diaw inadvertently poked Stoudemire in the right eye during practice, and Stoudemire awoke Thursday with swelling and blurred vision.    An examination showed there was no damage to the retina or the cornea, according to the East Valley Tribune.    ""He actually had some damage to his iris, which is not serious, fortunately,"" team GM Steve Kerr said, according to the Republic.    Stoudemire told paper he will likely wear goggles for the rest of his career.   I dont know if this will help ease your mind. If not I have a Brilliant Retenal specailist I can give you his number.He is in Oakville. If it wasn't for him I would be blind still from Diabetes. Dan"

Take heed youngsters!!!"

330186,retrofish,2009-04-15 01:30:00,4,"Dude,  Sorry to hear about this. About 10 years ago I tore my iris playing rugby - sounds similar to yours - eye drops, enlarged pupil (Which still has not and will not go down to normal level - it is an involuntary muscle) couldn't see for a couple days etc. The main thing I now find- and this took some time to get used to - is if I'm in ANY sunlight or daylight for that matter I need sunglasses; otherwise too much light gets into the eye due to your enlarged pupil and it will a) hurt  make me see weird spots/colours, c) get headaches. Needless to say I wear sunglasses ALWAYS when outside. Also, headaches were quite common at first anyway and a general 'tiredness' in the injured eye. However, this only happens now infrequently if I am very tired.  I stopped taking the drops after I read the possible side effects- they are strong! But I advise you get your eyes checked regularly at first. My eyes both were of the same prescription BEFORE, the injured one is way worse now. Make sure they give you an annual Glaucoma test as this injury affects your eye pressure. You will notice bright lights are not so easy on the sore eye anymore so try to avoid them. The sensitivity should subside somewhat with time.  We cannot wear goggles or anything in rugby as it mentioned for the Basketball player so my rugby career abruptly ended due to the injury. However, I still do lots of activity and exercise, just try to limit pressure build up to the head, especially early on. Wear tinted goggles for swimming etc. and it should be good. It may take some time for you to get used to it but you will.  Another famous person with this injury besides sports guys in B-Ball and hockey - remember Brian Bedard(?) is David Bowie. His enlarged pupil was caused by a torn iris due to a bicycle injury when he was a kid. It kinda sucks but just think - it could have been worse!  Best of luck bro,  Retro"
330334,bucktail,2009-04-15 13:56:00,1857,"  Thanks retro it sounds like the exact same thing I am going thru. Promised myself I wouldnt feak out till the end of the week and give it time to heal. Doesnt seem to be healing tho. Did you ever get shadows in the peripherial vision? Did tyour vision ever clear any in the eye over time? or is it the same as it was after the injury?   Thanks guys, heres hoping things get better."
330472,retrofish,2009-04-15 22:17:00,4,"Hey Bucktail,  Yep. shadows at first - went away. As far as vision clearing, yes it did but I wear glasses/contacts anyway. With glasses my 'hurt' eye vision is pretty good except for it being a way worse prescription than it was and light sensitivity is still an issue as previously mentioned; but overall all the cloudiness and immediate hurt/sore feeling definitely went away. I find my glasses are way better than contacts now too which is kind of weird since before there seemed to be no real difference. I'm sure eye shape could have been slightly affected.  I don't know if it helped since the iris IS an involuntary muscle but after my eye got feeling better I used to open the eye real wide under a light, close it again for a while and repeat over and over, sort of to get it used to reacting to light differences again. You'll notice the pupil will still only get so small while under the light compared to the other due to the muscle (iris) tearing but I thought it may have helped 'train' the muscle again. Various physiotherapists I have spoken to have said there is no reason that you should not be able to affect an involuntary muscle somewhat but this whole area is still a relatively new one in the health science area.  I've got my first real specialist appointment for over a few years on the 21st of April so if you remember and are interested, put up a post and I'll tell you what the specialist said. I am hoping I don't have to go back on the drops but I have heard they are good to prevent further eye degeneration again so 'll just have to wait and see.  One last thing - interestingly my 'dominant eye' for shooting and archery changed from my hurt eye to the other one. It is amazing how the body adapts to injury. Be positive - I was real bummed out at first but have shot, fished etc. excellently with my dominant eye change ever since. Over time you will adapt."
