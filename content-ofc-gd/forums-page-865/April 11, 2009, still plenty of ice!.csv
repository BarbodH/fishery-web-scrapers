Was out yesterday and worked hard all day to come back with nothin...I really hate when that happens. Talked to 3 other groups of guys on the lake I was at and between a total of 14 fishermen only 3 fish were on the ice by 3 pm..So i didn't feel so bad about comin home empty. Woke up today for the routine bacon and eggs and contemplated the plan. By noon myself and my counterparts (girlfriend, and dog) were off to see how far the bush roads were open. Made it far enough to unlolad the sled and hit up a wee lake. Trail in had some melted sections, but was ok for most of the 1.5 clicks. Anyway long story short lost a monster...   and iced this one for dinner tommorrow night... By the way still almost 3 ft of ice on the lakes. "
