329550,MJL,2009-04-13 14:23:00,2427,Well done Carole and to all those that participated.  Great post!
329630,Ramble,2009-04-13 20:15:00,713,"To answer the ""fish ladder"" question. They are really expensive to put in. Some i know have cost around the million dollar mark. Volunteers and elbow grease are a lot cheaper and the results are the same. Fish get upstream.  -Dave"
329631,River Rat,2009-04-13 20:26:00,161,I've fished coburg in the fall when it loked just like that....all the guys and nets I mean. Just another day on the the east tribs  good work everyone  RR
330132,Michael_Brown,2009-04-14 23:33:00,411,"Fish Ladder question. Here are some problems to solve before they go ahead with any change to the structure. The dam is on private property, it's a heritage site, silt concerns from the pond above, environmental concerns about disturbing the stream bed, money, money, money, & red tape. It would be great to see this dam upgraded but these are just some of the problems to overcome. Hopefully somebody takes the lead on this project before the dam gives up.  Thanks to all who came out to volunteer, watch, and enjoy a nice sunny day in Cobourg. The target number was two hundred fish over and we put 204. There was still lots of fish left in the pool. Seemed to be about 60% females over but I haven't heard the final count yet. After running the net line at the bottom all morning, I'm still drying out."
328628,Bly,2009-04-10 22:57:00,1556,"I was all pumped to participate in the Cobourg fish lift this year.  Was a little disappointed it was canceled last weekend, but after keeping in touch with Ron, I was happy to hear that it had been re-scheduled for today.  Cliff unfortunately couldn't make it out because of prior commitments, so I headed there by myself...with waders and big net at the ready!  Left the house bright and early and met up with the organizers at the designated spot.  Saw Ron right away and then listened for instructions.  The general plan was that we'd create a wall of nets and push our way under a bridge right up to a spot just below the dam.  The idea here was to force the fish upstream, and then trap them within an enclosed area.  Here's a pic of fellow OFNer JeffBornFishin as he made his way to the action....   Here is where we were pushing the fish...you'll notice posts in the foreground.  After the wall of nets forced the fish into this area, a net was put across the creek to keep them from running downstream.   Here we are under bridge...the wall of nets.  We were supposed to try to keep the nets taut so that all we did was force them upstream.  You can see that the water gets pretty deep towards the far side of this picture!   No matter how hard we tried, working against the strong current as one unit, it was inevitable that the odd fish was netted on the way upstream.   Releasing the fish ahead of us...   Jeff...thanks for taking pictures...here we are getting closer to our goal.   Getting ready to put the fence across the creek...   So, here's where the fun was to take place...just imagine...a few hundred steelhead in this one area!   First, the ladies and kids had a chance to get out there to net some fish...soon after, everyone with a net headed out to catch as many as we could.   Once you had a fish netted, you were to take it over holding pens....Here's Jeff working hard!   Here's a video of some of the action...showing everyone working and where the fish were taken to....   Some of the fish tried in vain to make it back downstream and they'd get stopped by the fence.  Because the fence was bowed in a little, you had to reach in and grab them by the tail.   Another video of the holding pens...   Once some measurements and stats were taken, the fish were put in baskets like this for the trip to the top side of the dam.   Some fish headed to the top side to head to their spawning grounds...   As Ron mentioned earlier, 204 fish were taken to the top side of this dam...to head to spawning grounds.  I had a great time out there today.  It's a lot of work...working against the current like that takes a lot out of you, but it feels really good to be a part of something like this to help out in sustaining the steelhead populations.  I took a few spills in the cold water today, but it didn't matter.  The waders held up really well, and I kept mostly dry throughout the day.  It's amazing just how warm you stay when you are constantly working and moving around.  I want to thank Ron, for the invitation to help out in this cause.  I also wanted to thank Jeff for taking pretty much all the pictures and video that I have of this event.  I met some great people today and I cannot express how wonderful it was to see so many people of different ages working hard to help out.  Ron...keep me up to date on when these fish lifts occur every year.  I'd love to help out again...  Maybe next time, Cliff can just stop being a lazy   and he'll join in the fun!"
328635,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-10 23:16:00,3761,"Sounds like it was a productive day out there, thanks for the update. I'll have to go there next year once i get some good waders.  "
328636,solopaddler,2009-04-10 23:16:00,8605," Ahh....opening day on Wilmot Creek. Brings back some fond memories, thanks for that Carole!    (Nice job btw)"
328637,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-10 23:23:00,260,Great post Bly!  I am sure glad some of the pics turned out so you could use them.  Was a fun day
328658,ecxstriper,2009-04-11 00:24:00,343,That looks like a good day Carole. Thanks for the report
328663,Leecher,2009-04-11 00:35:00,7832,"Great report, pics and videos Bly  Congratulations to all involved   :clapping: A lot of work and effort but well worth it!! Thanks for sharing your day with us Leechman"
328699,maybe,2009-04-11 01:41:00,307,"Jeff was just bouncing when he got back from the event.  Sounds like everyone had a blast - sorry I missed it!  In retrospect, I really wish we'd spent the time picking up a new net at the Sportsmen's show.  Our trusty old one got demolished our last day on the water last year.  Silly me, thinking we wouldn't need a new one until the marina reopens in May.  I've learned my lesson.  Thanks for loaning Jeff your camera, Carole!"
328703,Greencoachdog,2009-04-11 01:46:00,8163,Where are the hooks and fluro leaders???
328728,Bly,2009-04-11 02:43:00,1556,"  Jeff,  Great getting to see and chat with you again and thanks so much for all your great camera work and kind words!!  I am going to get the rest of the photos uploaded if you want any in larger sizes just let me know....will send a link via PM.   Mike,  Thanks for the heads up regarding the Wilmont on opening day lol"
328738,Paully,2009-04-11 03:10:00,712,LoL @ solo..    good one..
328739,Ron,2009-04-11 03:15:00,1683,"Yup yup,  Was indeed a great day. Once my daughter is done her Barrel Racing tomorrow, I will post the pictures of the water levels from the weekend before. That foot bridge you walked under has 8 inches of water over top!   Cheers, Ron..."
328797,highdrifter,2009-04-11 05:39:00,2534,That was awesome Bly.  Respect.  cheers!! HD
328881,Joey,2009-04-11 16:20:00,9122,Very cool recounting of the events Carole.  That looks like something I'd be into helping out with next year for sure.  Good job everyone  Joey
328886,Joey,2009-04-11 16:41:00,9122,"Hey Bly, I just noticed it is covered in the Toronto Sun today, with pics  Joey"
329045,Bly,2009-04-12 00:32:00,1556,"  Would love to see those pictures, when you have the time of course   Thanks again"
329051,Bly,2009-04-12 00:49:00,1556," Definitely worth the trip.   I was speaking with a few of the organizers and they were saying that they would really like to get more women and young people involved.  They have done a wonderful job creating a friendly atmosphere and everyone that wants to help gets a chance, it was really fun to watch the young children with the nets.  Thanks for letting me know about the Sun piece"
329110,douG,2009-04-12 03:52:00,2693,"Thanks to Carole, nice job."
329114,Stoty,2009-04-12 04:00:00,2910,"Only 204 this year??? I remember, not too many years back when I helped out, there would be 350+ fish on a bad day."
329116,Bly,2009-04-12 04:06:00,1556,"  Stoty,   I am sure a more qualified person can address this but my understanding is that 200 was the target number, there were more fish"
329118,Stoty,2009-04-12 04:21:00,2910," Oh really? wow. If memory serves me correctly..I remember a few years they were disappointed to not reach the 350 mark.  Did you happen to notice if the golf course was open? lol My dad's buddy owns the course, and I want to get out!"
329185,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-12 14:19:00,260,I have been told that this event was on CTV news Saturday.  I did not get to see it.  I can't find anything on CTV's website.  I did find however a bunch more pics:  http://photos.northumberlandtoday.com/myca...sp?event=729611  Enjoy!
329193,majorlifts,2009-04-12 14:39:00,171,"Okay, educate me, why no fish ladder? would`nt that be less intrusive. MNR? Building ladders at these dams,  isn't that part of the whole reason we pay for the licensing? I`m just wondering.  Seriously, I don't know much about all this, but would like to know more."
329198,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-12 14:48:00,260," The folks running the event told me a fish ladder is planned for this location ""at some point in the future"".  Yeah  I can't exactly say what the local residents said I spoke with"
329322,tibbs,2009-04-12 21:48:00,650,Good job to everyone who participated.
329453,Ron,2009-04-13 02:44:00,1683,"Hey, you know that walk bridge you walked under??? well, this was the weekend before, the reason we had to cancel.            Cheers, Ron..."
