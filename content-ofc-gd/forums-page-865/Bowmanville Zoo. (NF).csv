Someone told me to go to Bowmanville. Anyone here offer any advice for Bowmanville or any other zoo in GTA for that matter. I live in Acton (Guelph). Keep in mind I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old.  Thanks people,  Curt"
330099,ccmtcanada,2009-04-14 22:33:00,7971,"Bowmanville Zoo is perfect for you!  It's a smaller zoo, but can still take you most of the day to walk through it and see the animal show they have at the Animatheatre (it's actually a really good show they put on).  A lot of animals you see in the movies have come from the Bowmanville zoo.  They have some animals walking around freely that the kids can touch.  They also have some parts where you can actually feed the animals.  There are coin operated machines at those exhibits...you get a handful of food.  We took our little one there at 3 months up until about age 4 and she loved it each time.  It also has a small amusement park.  Last time we were there, they didn't have the splash pad...but that's just another reason to go.  They have a website... http://www.bowmanvillezoo.com/index.html"
330107,drwxr,2009-04-14 22:41:00,453,why dont you go to african lion safari its close to guelph
330110,nancur373,2009-04-14 22:44:00,1211,Been there a few times. Wasn't overly impressed. We'd like to go somewhere where we can walk most the day.
330124,Sinker,2009-04-14 23:20:00,8692,"Bowmanville zoo is ok, but I'd go to the metro zoo if your looking to spend a day. You can do bowmanville in much less than a day, and I honestly think you'll be dissappointed coming from guelph. We usually get a family pass there, just because its so close, but by no means will it take you all day to see everything there.  Sinker"
330127,ccmtcanada,2009-04-14 23:23:00,7971,Sinker...with a 3 month old and 2 year old it can take 3 days...LOL.  It is a smaller zoo...but much more kid friendly I found compared to the Metro Zoo.
330162,nancur373,2009-04-15 01:05:00,1211,Thanks for all the info guys. I'll pass on Metro...we'd actually like to see the animals.

She's retiring after this year at the age of 20. I was just watching her pick at the back of James Duthie's head, looking for bugs. She picked the Bruins over the Habs so give her a thumbs up from me   .  http://www.tsn.ca/story/?id=274261"
330233,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-15 03:03:00,2582,"It's been awhile since I was at Bowmanville. It was a once a season MUST visit when my kids where small though. We all enjoyed it when the kids where young, but a half day is plenty of time to take it in.  Metro Zoo was also a MUST every year. Both different. But you can't go wrong with either.  I hope you get a nice day for your outing."
330257,Ron,2009-04-15 03:52:00,1683,"Bomanville zoo is great, especially for the age of your kids. If you find that you go through it too fast and have ore time to spend, you could still take in Jungle and Cat World in Kirby or even better you could spend the day at Peterborough Zoo where I believe admission is free and the kids will have a hoot in the monkey house feeding the Carp that come in looking for the food which you buy for a quarter.  Cheers, Ron..."
330315,Headhunter,2009-04-15 12:59:00,5703,"I'll 2nd Ron's suggestion of Orno Cat World. If your into exotic cats, and want to see one close and I mean close, this is the place for you. The Toronto Zoo is nice, but you just don't get close to the animals. Orno Cat World puts you within feet of these incredible animals. You could do the Bowmanville zoo in the morning and arrive at Orno Cat World for 1:00pm feeding time quite easily. It anit fancy, but without a doubt, the best place to see lions, tigers, panthers etc... up close and personal. HH"
330318,Tom McCutcheon,2009-04-15 13:10:00,627,"All good suggestions. While your in the area and need more to do , you could try the Reptile Zoo on #7 about 15 minutes east of Peterborough. I took my niece and nephew there last year and they both enjoyed it. Try to time your visit for one of the seminars. The kids learn a lot about snakes and turtles aligators and crocadiles and even get a hands on demonstration with a python. Takes about an hour to an hour and a half to go through.  Have fun."
330344,SBCregal,2009-04-15 14:34:00,688,ive heard a zoo in brantford is good as well...havent been there yet but plan on it this summer.  http://www.twinvalleyzoo.com/
330387,LebowSKI,2009-04-15 17:06:00,27,"The coolest zoo I've been to yet is the Northwood Ranch in Port Perry.  It's a lot less busy than most places and it allows you to be a little more involved with the animals.  They have an old toothless black bear that you can feed by hand, and last year they had a pen with a couple tiger cubs and a lion cub that you could walk right into and play with.  Seeing them feed the lions and wolves is also pretty cool to watch."
