Ontario this week.  I arranged a guided day on the Grand River with Steve Piggott (smithville-fisher) who runs Angler's Way Guide Service.  Steve is a great guy to fish with... very knowledgeable and friendly.  He walked me through all things Cat fishing related.  We had a great day out there, landing double digit cats with most being in the 8-12lb range.  Within 5 mins of setting up I hear Steve yell... ""There's a cat"" and I stepped into my first Channel Catfish ever.      Steve tying into one.    Double.  About 20 mins into the day.    More cats.            Steve's rig.  Pretty much my dream boat.  20' Lund Alaskan Tiler, 90HP.    The last fish of the day turned out to be the kicker!  17.3lbs on the digital scale      Thanks, Steve, for an amazing day out there."

329848,HTHM,2009-04-14 02:48:00,4082,ANything over 7 pounds out of that water it is not a good idea to eat. However a cleaning tutorial would be welcome.
329933,mattyk,2009-04-14 13:13:00,2110,"great report, thanks for sharing!"
329941,Jen,2009-04-14 13:55:00,833,Awesome trip report...  Cheers Jen
329960,T.Barry,2009-04-14 14:54:00,24,Nice meeting you on the water Ben.  Steve Piggot sure knows his way with the cats.  With the strong east winds the fishing was a little slow but still some nice cats.  Our biggest of the day were two 19 lbers not caught by me LOL!!!
330030,trapshooter,2009-04-14 19:03:00,1234,"Yeah, nice to meet up with you guys as well.  Two 19's is awesome!!  Steve is a great guy to fish with, not to mention that nice live sucker he tossed you guys.  Class act for sure."
330065,spyder3g,2009-04-14 20:56:00,50,Are they edible?
330091,trapshooter,2009-04-14 22:05:00,1234,"Anything is edible, I guess.  I wouldn't keep one myself, especially not a big one.  Lots of ppl. eat catfish though."
