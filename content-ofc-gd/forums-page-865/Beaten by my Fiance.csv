I appreciate the help on conditions on the Niagara (which werent so good), so we went fo the Grand instead.  Saw Steve down at Fishmaster, and he hooked us up with the right gear, bait and some suggestions for where to go.  See below for the results.  We ended up landing 11 nice fish, with the smallest being maybe 2 lbs.  The largest was 31.5"" long, and massive girth.  Any guesses as to the weight of the last fish?  Thanks again to Steve for great advice.          And the big one!!!!  "

329799,Radnine,2009-04-14 01:22:00,1538,Did you drive through Caledonia on your way home? I passed someone pulling a Pricecraft side console (black truck?) while I was jogging today (around 4:00 or so). Jim

329931,Reel North,2009-04-14 13:08:00,24,"Here is a side view of the same fish  31.5"" x massive girth  Please throw a guess on weight - it felt minimum 17-18 lbs, but I have no experience weighing cats  "
329963,DANIMAL,2009-04-14 15:06:00,215,"Nice cats. And your probably right on with your guesse. I've cought two 18 pounders there this spring, and one was 31'' and the other was 33''."
