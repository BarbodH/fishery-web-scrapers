All I can really suggest is Triline smooth casting, fireline crystal, spiderwire fabric braids, Triline abrasion resistant. Those are really the top selling lines out there. Then theres a ton of lines by smaller companies. Keep trying things till you get one you like.  Ive always found its usually not the knot strength, its the knot your using. If your line keeps breaking, upsize."
329901,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-14 10:51:00,3761,My fav mono is 12lb Trilene Extra Smooth Casting XL. Been using it for several years now and i have had no issues.
329912,Reel North,2009-04-14 11:31:00,24,"I have been using powerpro for the last 3 season, and love it.  I use 20 lbs for general use - it is thick enough not to bury itself, and had great breeaking strength.   I then use an triple surgeons to connect it to 8-12 lb flurocarbon (another 6-8 ft).  It rarely if ever breaks at the knot.  I find this gives the sensitivity of braid, with the stealth of fluro.  It works for me!"
329930,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-14 13:05:00,4399,"I like to keep it simple, Trilene and Stren are best for the type of fishing. For me flourocarbon and it`s variations are a waste of time and money."
329946,Garnet,2009-04-14 14:14:00,2056,A little more on what and how you fish would help.  Try Spider Thread Braid it's the latest technology in braids.  Garnet
329954,KelfuN,2009-04-14 14:33:00,246,"i've been using stren original 8lb for at least 10 years, no problems at all. give sufix a try...they are great lines too"
329968,bassjnkie,2009-04-14 15:15:00,1101,"For a braid I only use Power Pro. For mono, it's Big Game which is very abrasion resistant or Suffix Elite mono. I've tried them all over the years. As mentioned above, what are you targeting?"
329985,Garry2Rs,2009-04-14 16:04:00,1425,What weight is the P-Line? What type of fishing are you doing with it? Are you using Spinning or Casting reels? What Knot or Knots are you using? What exactly are the problems you are haveing with the Floro-Clear P-Line?
329997,kemper,2009-04-14 16:37:00,2232,Only two types of line touch my reels.  Its either Power Pro or its Maxima Ultragreen

330001,kemper,2009-04-14 16:47:00,2232, Is that the highlighter green crap?  20 lbs test eh? Why not go with braid if you are using that high test...
330006,spyder3g,2009-04-14 16:59:00,50,"If you like mono, my order  1. Shakespeare Cajun (red) 6 - 10 lb for Medium  (Minus is memory) 2. Stern Original 4-6 lb (yellow) for Ultra-L  (Minus is too stretchy)  I've just ordered P-Line 6lb to try on my Ultra-L"
330103,Cudz,2009-04-14 22:36:00,2652,Trilene 8lb XL for genral fishing on Simcoe. Power Pro 30 lb on casting reals. Cajun 17 lb on other casting reels. Power pro 30 lb for down rigger with a 10 lb mono leader.
330205,skeeter,2009-04-15 02:06:00,1907,"personaly i use thread from the sewing baskit, if you dont catch anything its just as good---lol  i only use non stretch line like spider fusion but since they dont make that anymore i switched to power pro. non stretch line is super sensitive and you feel everything with it. when trolling you can see the rod tip bouncing with the motion of the lure, if a weed gets on the lure the rod stops bouncing, and a quick jerk of the rod will get the weed off."
330208,Sinker,2009-04-15 02:16:00,8692,I always buy Trilene. It works fine.
330209,EC1,2009-04-15 02:19:00,930,"X10000 on Trilene XL! If you're looking into braid, PP and Sufix, you can't go wrong!"
330216,BillM,2009-04-15 02:27:00,17367,Different lines for different setups.
