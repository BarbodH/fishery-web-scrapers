328953,Big Cliff,2009-04-11 21:09:00,6899,"Stopped by my blind this afternoon just to make sure everything was as it should be. There they were about 40 birds, one very large tom and as near as I could tell about 7 jakes. Monday morning should be a good one, these guys have been hanging around there all spring. Everyone else set to go?"

329026,motv8tr,2009-04-11 23:55:00,2587,"They know when opening day is, once it comes there won't be one around   that's how it seems here...keep dodging them on the road but when the season opens I meet very few hunters who have had success....  Maureen"
329735,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-13 23:47:00,260, Best of luck Cliff I know you will bag one or two!
329750,bigugli,2009-04-14 00:02:00,6138,There are some large groups of birds here in Niagara. Unfortunately many are now in no shooting zones and extended urban boundaries.
329766,richyb,2009-04-14 00:31:00,774,Yep all ready to bag me a thunder chicken. hopefully with the bow this year
329784,nautifish,2009-04-14 00:50:00,1416,I have seen a group of well over 50 or more every single day for the past three weeks in two fields very close to my home......  I don't hunt but have been thinking about taking a course.   Good luck cliff.
329893,Chuck Best,2009-04-14 08:32:00,308,"Yes,I was planning to get the bow out and practice abit,but I really need to find a private spot this year as I had a father and son team 'surround' me and my deaks last year......and it was not much fun,they had guns and I had a bow.........You using your Middleton Cliff???......I'm sure you'll get one...........TC and Straight shots........Chuck.........."
330284,Big Cliff,2009-04-15 10:03:00,6899,"I think I'll use my 870 this year Chuck, my blind isn't very big and I think I'd have a problem shooting a crossbow from it. I'd like to try it with the crossbow though so if they have a fall hunt again this year I might do a bit more work on the blind and give it a try.  Hope you find a place where you can hunt without being crowded out."
330352,crappiesteve,2009-04-15 14:59:00,220,"..Yes the 27th is the day,can't wait to get one with my Bow  .Good luck to all who get out.   Steve"
