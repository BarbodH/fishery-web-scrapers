Over 180 photos and it was nice to browse through them. Thanks for taking the pictures for us Chad.   Cobourg Fish lift images   Cheers, Ron..."

I have loved fishing since as far back as I can remember and since I am 29 you think it would be easy lol.., and now I am merging my love of photography into it.  I feel its always good to photograph events such as this as it helps make people aware of how important it is to help keep our waters clean and free of pollution! And how one little event can have such a positive impact on preserving the fish numbers in the local waters so in years our grandkids can enjoy fishing the same waters!."
