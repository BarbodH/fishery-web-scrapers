329789,Pigeontroller,2009-04-14 01:01:00,2793," We have a huge raffle table and an incredible silent auction with custom lures, guided trips, fishing gear,etc.  All proceeds raised by Muskies Canada will directly impact the Muskie fishery in Ontario, an example of this would be the over 3000 7-10 inch fall fingerling stocked into Lake Simcoe in '07 an '08."
