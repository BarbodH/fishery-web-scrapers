330212,Handlebarz,2009-04-15 02:23:00,3790,Well what is there to say about this show  I dont know what to say about this show it was for FREEKING GREAT these guys were awesome Paul JP and Dave know what they are doing and sure do know how to get there point out there I did actually learn some stuff that I will be trying out this year From Paul talking about the great lakes trolling (he knows his stuff) to JP on the rivers and how to make the best use of your sonar (That was some very useful info) for them to Dave and the POOP story and much more I can not list as I have to get off to bed.  Ryan it was great to put a face to the board name sorry I did not get to talk to others that were there I have to work early and need to go to bed now.  I will post some pics tomorrow but leave you with one thing and that is if you were thinkin gof not going because you think they are just going to push the product you are WRONG they are there to teach you and also help you fine tune your skills you already have.   Dont miss any of the other shows they are worth the drive I am 1 hour away from the Sarnia show and have been up since around 1 am today and will be back up between 3-4 for work tomoorw and I can say it was well worth it if I can make it out for another show I will be there Maybe London if I dont work Friday.  Cheers and get your arse out there but please go pee before Dave talks or bring your minnow bucket.
