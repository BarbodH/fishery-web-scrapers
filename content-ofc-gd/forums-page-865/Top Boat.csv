329645,stan_133,2009-04-13 21:23:00,77,Just wondering who you think builds the best boat.
329649,Greencoachdog,2009-04-13 21:28:00,8163,The best is debatable.  ... but these are some of the fastest!!!  http://www.bulletboats.com/  Catch those 100 mph Bass!!!
329650,kuhaman,2009-04-13 21:30:00,503,"Thats a pretty vague subject, what type of boat? If its 14' aluminum fishin boats then I'm gonna have to go with Lund."
329651,Cast-Away,2009-04-13 21:31:00,790,"How is this information?  The J.D. Powers and Associates 2008 Boat Competitive Information Study examines overall customer satisfaction based upon performance in eight factors: cabin; engine; ride and handling; helm and instrument panel; design and styling; sound system; water sports; and fishing.

329658,Bernie,2009-04-13 21:59:00,3190,"That's a loaded question!. Should be more than a couple opinions here   But that is why there are many different kinds and options, to each their own. Here's another good option, but I will admit a little bias.   They are a good boat though.    "
329661,Terry,2009-04-13 22:03:00,14456,Bernie wins they are a beautiful boat
329666,glen,2009-04-13 22:07:00,2641,Bernie can you do a wood bass boat?
329668,Bernie,2009-04-13 22:17:00,3190,"Anything is possible with these Glen but it would only be defeating the design. An open bottom, easy to maintain, light, strong and inexpensive are all what have made these one of the oldest boat manufacturers made in Canada."
329679,John,2009-04-13 22:42:00,2956,"They are definitely a thing of beauty Bernie!  S.N.C., if you are looking for advice you will find many opinions on this subject, but you will need to be more specific as to what type of boat. If you are looking for info on which to base a decision, I will gladly tell you everything that I learned from 2 months of research last summer when I bought my new boat."
329701,irishfield,2009-04-13 23:18:00,26272,The one you own outright and can enjoy without bailing !!!
329856,stan_133,2009-04-14 03:19:00,77,Really i wasn't looking for any type of boat in particular i was just interested in what people had to say in general. i know that that are countless different types of boats for different activities but I'm sure that everyone has there top pick for what ever the class. just wanted to hear what is best about the boat they own or something that they read/heard about.
329857,stan_133,2009-04-14 03:23:00,77,i gotta say Bernie that that is a nice looking boat. i saw a few in Peterborough last year and they all looked great  
329859,fishboy,2009-04-14 03:25:00,550,you'll never get consensus on this one!
329861,trapshooter,2009-04-14 03:28:00,1234,TILLER!!
329917,Mike the Pike,2009-04-14 11:46:00,3421, Now I have to agree with Ben on this one
330069,Tybo,2009-04-14 21:13:00,1373,"Any one over 30 foot, that will do 140 mph and up!"
330075,JohnF,2009-04-14 21:32:00,3494, Is yer name Bob Hayward?  JF
330093,irishfield,2009-04-14 22:11:00,26272, No wonder Joey never catches anything trolling with you on BOQ!!!
330106,Cudz,2009-04-14 22:40:00,2652,Most Allison Bass boats will whoop most bullet boats.  Too many 100+mph Allisons out there.
330112,misfish,2009-04-14 22:46:00,29133," Heard thier the fastest,but not the stabilested. Looked one over at a shop just north of here.Very sleak idesign,but no body.  Im still humble to the crestliner myself."
330119,Greencoachdog,2009-04-14 23:02:00,8163, No crap???... you looking for another boat to jump a rock outcropping with???
330136,HTHM,2009-04-14 23:43:00,4082,starcraft!
330173,wiggler,2009-04-15 01:12:00,16,Well I don't really own a boat except the ol' 14 'sprinbok and 9.8 merc my dad left to my brothers and I at the cottage. I've spent countless hours dreaming up the perfect boat for what I want it to do. I actually have a folder of bookmarks with boat manufacturers saved.   I normally fish small lakes and occasionally hit  the BOQ for monster fall walleye. Of all the boats I have drooled over I think the Alumacraft Navigator 165 would fit the bill....for me. Trimmed out with a 75hp tiller and all the electronics of course. I think I could still launch it in the lakes I like and it would also hold up to the nasty weather the BOQ throws at ya in the fall.  Alumacraft
