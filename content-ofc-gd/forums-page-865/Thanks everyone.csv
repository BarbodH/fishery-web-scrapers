330200,Angler16,2009-04-15 01:54:00,188,Hey just wanted to say thanks to everyone that gave me input on the beagles we did decide the beagles not for us and decided to look at the Jugs(half jack russel half pug). Going to be getting him off of Kijiji. A little easier to take care of and better suited for us. Thanks again. LA
