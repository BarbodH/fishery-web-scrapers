619726,phatpelkey,2011-09-09 01:51:00,78,  that woulda been neat to see
618936,Terry,2011-09-06 16:57:00,14456,"I was playing with my underwater camera  it was wavy and the boat was moving at a fair clip, so I would set the camera on bottom , when the cable got tight I would pull it closer. Let it sit back on bottom and do it all again. so camera control just wasn't there and sometimes the fish were just above the view of the camera I was quite surprised just how many bass there were, I covered a fairly large area and there was bass everywhere I put the camera down   <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2Qrdd32Tix0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
618945,Live2fish85,2011-09-06 17:35:00,1633,Cool video Terry. There sure is a ton of bass out there. Maybe I will have to take a trip and take a day off of Erie.
618947,Terry,2011-09-06 17:38:00,14456," yeah but try catching them that's a whole other ball game  there were 4 boats where I first pulled up to fish and the guy in the closest boat said they only got one bass, so that's why I put the camera down..to see if there were anything down there... tons of them"
618949,Live2fish85,2011-09-06 17:45:00,1633,That's half the fun of fishing  . I have days like that on Erie and it's usually just in need of a change of color or change to something that rattles.  Just wondering where is a good place to launch on Simcoe. I have never fished it and I really want to now.  The wife is letting me go fishing for the weekend for a birthday present. Maybe I'll make it up there and get some Simcoe Bass.
618951,johnnyb,2011-09-06 17:50:00,3413,That is crazy...they are literally everywhere!
618952,Terry,2011-09-06 17:50:00,14456, there are lots of marinas  but most times I launch in Keswick at the free ramp on lake drive just north of Ravenshoe road it's not the best ramp but free seems to make it stand out
618953,Terry,2011-09-06 17:53:00,14456," you would think so wouldn't you  the second last time I was there there were nothing but pan fish and there were thousands of them  so you would sure expect to catch something    <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l1-SDPMfIaU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
618955,JustinHoffman,2011-09-06 18:00:00,482,"Cool video, Terry. Awesome to see how many actually school up...and how difficult they are to catch.  Felt like a clip from ""Hook and Look""...only thing missing was you and your scuba gear  Thanks for sharing.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
618960,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-06 18:13:00,130, translation: What the heck? What am I doing wrong? How come I am am not catching more fish? What the heck? What the heck? end of translation.  eye opening insight...thanks.
618987,misfish,2011-09-06 19:14:00,29133,"Cool vid bud.  Was that in the Cbay?  Triggering them fish ,would be throwing a tube and ripp,n it out of the weeds. Seen it done and have done myself. They looked like they were looking for active feed."
618992,Terry,2011-09-06 19:17:00,14456, thanks  yes it was  they didn't want to bite anyone that was fishing there
619082,drewbrew,2011-09-07 00:05:00,31,Good video nice to see whats actually goin on down their for a change!
619088,Roy,2011-09-07 00:21:00,13728,Beauty! How deep were those smallies Terry?
619095,Terry,2011-09-07 00:33:00,14456,the fish were from 12 ft to 22 ft deep  the first part of the video was on a shoal that was totally covered in zebra mussels ....... if you look hard you can see them on the bottom
619099,Joey,2011-09-07 00:48:00,9122,"That's really cool and quite amazing at the same time Terry.  I bet they just sit down there and laugh at our bait.  Knowing how many are down there now and having only caught a handful on Simcoe, it's actually kinda a slap in the face"
619108,Rattletrap2,2011-09-07 00:58:00,1652,Very cool Terry!  Do you believe the old adage that 90% of the fish live in 10% of the water?  I sure do! I spend more time watching the fish these days than I do fishing for them!
619114,Rizzo,2011-09-07 01:13:00,4754,neat videos...I also just discovered I could have both videos running at the same time!
619231,Terry,2011-09-07 15:46:00,14456,LOL stereo..nice..  glad everyone liked it
619233,Homer Is King,2011-09-07 15:55:00,305,"Wow, that's cool. You just moved the under water camera a few notches higher on my wish list!  What make are you using? It seems to do a really good job!"
619234,Terry,2011-09-07 16:06:00,14456,"this is the camera  http://www.ebay.ca/i...=item33606f2e59      along with a dvr to record something like this    http://www.ebay.ca/i...984.m1438.l2649  all from ebay   <iframe width=""420"" height=""345"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/fReTjeneCu0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>    I have the manufacturer, looking in to making me a B/W low lux .0003 500 lines .........for deep water where colour doesn't work anyways"
619575,manjo39,2011-09-08 18:21:00,354,  Really enjoyed watching that.  Amazing.  I thought I saw a bass going for a worm at around 34 seconds.  Maybe someone jigging?
619581,Terry,2011-09-08 18:36:00,14456,"yeah I saw that too I think it was the boat just over from me  I saw him toss it towards my boat, but I did not know I caught it on video........... it is fun to watch  I really don't fish much when I am filming..I just pay too much attention to the camera  it 's easier on the ice, I can watch the camera and fish for perch.. but it is hard when I get deeper and bigger fish..the wrap around the cable..all the time..so I just play with the camera"
619587,jimmer,2011-09-08 18:42:00,2730,"I was expecting a bunch of smallies, but it looks like most of them were largemouth. That's a crazy video!"
619719,lpu_ofn,2011-09-09 01:25:00,29,"  Great video and good stuffs! I made a underwater camera using a modified CCTV security camera and a GPS (with AV-in) as a LCD monitor.    It's not professional, but works"
619725,Terry,2011-09-09 01:46:00,14456,cool  I started making underwater cameras over 25 years ago  camera parts were very expensive back then and the only thing I could think of for the casing was a water proof flashlight  a couple leaked at some point and one a pike bite and poked holes in it..was almost worth the cost to see it grab it...gave up on spending money on them...
