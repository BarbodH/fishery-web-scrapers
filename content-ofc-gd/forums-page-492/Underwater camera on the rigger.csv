620010,vinnimon,2011-09-10 00:48:00,2593,"I have an aqua view scout underwater camera, with 100 ft of cable. I do know they sell the hardware to rig it up to the down riggers as well. Has anyone tried it/have one. View points are needed as to the hassles I may fear while doing this. Cable drag, keeping the camera straight while its swimming in reverse. I do know I have to let the cable out and retreive it manually, thats is a pita on its own. But other than that, any input will be apreciated. Thanks a ton"
