619174,highdrifter,2011-09-07 07:30:00,2534,Looks like plastic on the cork...  You sure it's from the 60s?!?!
619177,solopaddler,2011-09-07 09:30:00,8605,Actually Ron I'm pretty sure it's a spin/fly combo.  In all liklihood the handle can be reversed making it a fly rod.  Regardless of its worth it's in mint shape and is a neat item for sure.
619188,Darrel,2011-09-07 11:32:00,82,"No! What I am sure of though, that it's from the 50's, just like the post says!!! Not the 60's!!!  But you are correct about the cork handle being wrapped to preserve it. That's just the way my wife's granddad was with his collectibles. You should see all the real old vinyl LP's & 45,s he left me. Some old Elvis and Beatles gems, among many other priceless beauties!"
619194,highdrifter,2011-09-07 11:59:00,2534, Crafty them Japanese!!
619199,cuzza,2011-09-07 12:23:00,467,I think Solo's got it - have a look at this - scroll down to the picture of the red rod in about 7 or 8 pieces and read from a couple of paragraphs above there (unless you want to read about making arrows from cane first ) http://www.maxrod.net/article/
619218,fishnsled,2011-09-07 14:07:00,3520, Absolutely!! Very cool item to have.
619356,Garnet,2011-09-07 23:04:00,2056,Bassmasters Mag. has a What's it Worth antique tackle every month. Have seen lot's of fly rods just can't put my hands on issue right now.
619456,Ron,2011-09-08 03:13:00,1683," You are probably right about the bag, I just couldn't read the patch. as Solo says, you can't put a price on a neat item like this. I for one would be proud to have a granddad give me something like that. Still would be interesting to find a value on it just for insurance purposes though. Good luck on your search.  Cheers, Ron...    You got it Solo, never thought of that.  Cheers, Ron..."
619458,Darrel,2011-09-08 03:25:00,82,"I'm still searching, but no luck yet!!! The relics that I've gotten over the years from my wife's granddad is remarkable; from old hand tools, to vinyl records, to old razors, shavers and knives. Like ya said, ya can't put a price on some of these things, yet I'd like to know just because. I'll keep you guys informed regarding the fly rod!!"
619507,Harrison,2011-09-08 14:15:00,2202,"Very nice rod.  In fantastic shape.  I am no expert, but I have bought and sold a dozen or so cane rods.  Mostly American/Britsh pre 1950's.  I am not familiar with the stamp on this rod.  However, I would hazard to guess it is not overly valuable ""yet"". It may become quite valuable down the road with the war collectors, moreso then angling collectrs.  IMO  Great rod and something to hold on to for sure."
618895,Darrel,2011-09-06 14:54:00,82,"I was given a 1950's era Japanese 5 pc fly rod from my wifey's granddad, which appears to have never been used and still in its original cloth. I have been trying to find out further info about it on line, but not having much luck. Who's the expert here that knows specifics/going price about this particular rod? All I have been able to figure out is some specifics that would make it more or less in price, yet no actual prices."
618898,Roy,2011-09-06 15:07:00,13728,What's the inscription on it?
618899,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:10:00,82,"There is nothing but a Japanese, Shiatsu stamp on it from Tokyo.When I typed that in, that's when I found out it was a 1950's era fly rod"
618902,Roy,2011-09-06 15:14:00,13728,"I thought that ""shiatsu"" meant ""finger pressure massage""."
618904,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:17:00,82,"hahaha...yes, it does and I found that funny too...but hey, isn't holding a fishing rod of any sort considered a finger massage? lol"
618906,BillM,2011-09-06 15:18:00,17367,I'm assuming it's bamboo?
618907,OhioFisherman,2011-09-06 15:18:00,6623,"Don`t spend the money before you get it. There were a lot of bamboo fly rods made, and not surprisingly in Japan, close to the material? I have one myself from the 40`s or 50`s, not worth much at all."
618910,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:19:00,82,"Yes, it's bamboo, but not hexagon shape. Only flat one side."
618912,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:21:00,82,"Ohiofisherman  Read the original post...It was given to me! I already have it and was inquiring about it  LOL  And coming from my wifey's granddad, it is probably cheap, LOL."
618913,BillM,2011-09-06 15:23:00,17367,I'd get a shop that specializes in bamboo flyrods to take a look at it.  I'm sure there are more then a few qualified places in southern Ontario that would be able to help you out.
618915,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:25:00,82,"That's my next step, but seeing that I was here, thought I might find an answer. Thanks!"
618916,Musky or Specks,2011-09-06 15:26:00,2710,Most Japanese bamboo fly rods from the past are essentially worthless.  English or American rods are what your looking for
618917,Darrel,2011-09-06 15:28:00,82,"Cool cool, but never the less, I might as well have it checked out. Thanks!"
618920,OhioFisherman,2011-09-06 15:35:00,6623,"Big take a look at the bamboo fly rods on ebay, you might find the same one?"
618941,cuzza,2011-09-06 17:10:00,467,"The 'flat one side' bit is interesting, not seen that before  Japanese rods from that era are so common as a lot of soldiers were over there at that time and picked them up and as a result they're not worth much but it's a nice thing to have especially if it's in such good condition.  Even the English stuff isn't worth much unless it's in mint condition and was made by certain people."
619062,ChrisK,2011-09-06 23:00:00,2772,Lets see a picture of that pole
619094,woodenboater,2011-09-07 00:32:00,2277,You could always ask the guys at Wilson's (fly fishing shop in Toronto). Figure they would be your best bet unless there's another fly shop out your way.
619121,Darrel,2011-09-07 01:23:00,82,"Here's some pic of the rod. They are small photos, but don't know how to make them any bigger because of the options of 250K maximum upload...unless I post individual pics. Let me know and I could do that if these ones are too hard to make out.    "
619130,Darrel,2011-09-07 01:45:00,82,"Ahh, what the hell. Here are individual, bigger photos of the fly rod. "
619132,Darrel,2011-09-07 01:46:00,82,
619133,Darrel,2011-09-07 01:47:00,82,

619135,Darrel,2011-09-07 01:49:00,82,
619161,Ron,2011-09-07 02:50:00,1683,"It appears that what you have is not a fly rod. It is more so an older closed face reel pack rod. You can tell this by the location of the reel seat. A fly rod seat is located on the bottom of the handle. There are 3 different tip sections to give you 3 different actions. More importantly, post a picture of the patch on that rod bag."
619169,Darrel,2011-09-07 03:17:00,82," The patch is posted; it says Fraser Co. Angling Specialists Montreal, yet it may not be the original cloth it came in...but like I said in an earlier post, when I typed in the stamp from the rod into google search, 1950's Era, Japanese 5 piece fly rod collectable appeared at the top of the list. As well, My wife's granddad's name is on the box with the date of 1953. He was a fighter pilot in WWII and Korea and more than likely bought it for a keep sake over seas. It's never been used!!!"
