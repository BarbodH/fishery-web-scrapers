618988,Fishing 24/7,2011-09-06 19:14:00,709,"  why would i not do my famous E.A.P (exented arm pose ?!?!? have you read a fishing mag lately ?!?!?!  show more shore line and docks ??????  i dont want anyone eye balling my spots trying to figure out where i was , what time of the day it was and how do they get there.  and finaly.  not show the lures?  why would i hide something that can teach other anglers what to use . how to use it. and whats bitting this time of the year.   i dont know what you think angling is all about bud.  1. never show the shoreline.  2. teach others how to fish , what to fish with, whats working.  3. when taking pictures. at least 75% of the picture has to be about the FISH!  not the land scape the mess in your boat or the beers lying around at the bottom."
