When I get it in forward it will stall, when put to full throttle it will only be putting out half the speed. My filter is brand new, the intake on the tank is clean. Not sure what to check now. Wondering if it's a fuel pump issue or something wrong withthe carbs.The floats and needles are 3 monthes old also. It worked for thelast 4 monthes and I let it sit for about 2 weeks. Thanks"
618601,livinisfishin,2011-09-05 17:19:00,661,Forgot to mention the motors fast idle lever will get the engine to run at max throttle. I put it in reverse for full throttle it will run at what sounds to be correct. When at 3/4 throttle forward runs close to where it should but once iput it all the way down it slows down and dies.

618661,aplumma,2011-09-05 20:39:00,6896,Check the linkage on the powerhead to see if the timing advancement linkage has not become disconnected. It is the part that as you advance the throttle it movers the base under the flywheel.   Art

The first thing i would do is a compression test on all four cylinders, mine turned out to be a damaged piston ring on the bottom cylinder...complete rebuild needed. I hope that is not the case with yours but I would definately start with a compression test if everything else seems to fine. Good luck."
619406,livinisfishin,2011-09-08 00:50:00,661,Well I appreciate all the replies but I decided to pass the problem on to somebody that knows a lot more then me about outboards. I should find out what is wrong with it by the end of the week. Here's to hoping its something simple! Thanks again!
619685,livinisfishin,2011-09-08 23:40:00,661,They checked compression and everything was good there. They cleaned both of my carbs now it misfires on the top two cylinders. They think it may be electrical....I'm wondering if they just didn't sync the carbs right. Find out tomorrow when the outboard guylooks at it.
