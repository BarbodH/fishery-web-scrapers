619750,lakemaster,2011-09-09 02:55:00,36, I think its a cross breed between a lake trout and a brook trout if I am not mistaken

619756,adempsey,2011-09-09 03:14:00,1498,They are a stocked fish.  Just contact the MNR in the area or search the net for the stocking lists.   I'll search through my pdfs to see if I can find it.  edit: here is a link the 2007-2010 stocking list for the Bancroft-Mazinaw area - http://www.ontariostewardship.org/councils/bancroft/files/Stocking_List_2007_2010_final.pdf
