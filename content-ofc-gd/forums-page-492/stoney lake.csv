619679,davey buoy,2011-09-08 23:19:00,5505,"Maybe,let us know when you get back.I've wanted to try that lake for some time,just don't know anyone who knows the lake."
619694,Jer,2011-09-09 00:13:00,1426,"There's a public launch beside Viamedes Resort. You have to park up the road, but at 6am, that shouldn't be a problem."
619717,Fishn Technishn,2011-09-09 01:16:00,198,"Been fishing that lake for more than 20 years. They call it Stoney for good reason!! There are 2 public ramps that I know of,  1 at Viamede(GOOD ONE!) and 1 at McCracken's Landing Don't know how it is  these days  Want to know some stuff about Stoney let me know by PM. I will be heading up there Sat for a week.  ft"

So many great looking spots that produce nada. I put in long days trying to figure it our, but still came up empty. I think that the walleye like the evening and into night. The smallies must not like rocks?????? Hope you have better luck than I did."
619935,workwear,2011-09-09 20:57:00,592,thanks for all the info guys....
619937,esoxansteel,2011-09-09 21:28:00,1307,"Stony is a great lake keeping between the markers will keep you safe, but to catch fish you need to explore, a GPS will help, but theres more sholes that are not marked than are marked, the north end of the lake is safer for travel and holds the deepest water, once you go through beaushein narrows the water depts change and the structure becomes more prevalent, depending on what you targeting ie walleyes dont be afraid to fish deep in this shield lake, up to 50ft. is common.  "
619968,Billy Bob,2011-09-09 22:39:00,5865,LOVE Stoney Lake....only fished it twice but did good both times....once in late May and once in Late June......great top water lake for smallies and largemouth......also has some VERY nice Bluegills......not to mention my target fish....walleyes.  I wish I could help you now but I'm sure it's a completely different pattern now in the second week of September.....but it feels like mid July here in WNY...  Good Luck and take LOTS of nightcrawlers... Bob
