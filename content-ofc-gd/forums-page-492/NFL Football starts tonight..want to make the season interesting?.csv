Each week you pick your starting line up with 100 to spend. Each week the values of the players will go up or down depending on how your players did the week before.  Entry is 3 fishing lures to be sent to the winner at the end of the season.  If you want to join sign up through yahoo fantasy and go to salary cap football League is called Fishing and Football you will need the league number  Group ID# 4868 the Password is football  KIck off is tonight ! you can make your picks until Sunday  Good luck to all  Jamie

619509,Billy Bob,2011-09-08 14:37:00,5865," NFL has the BEST players in the world playing....now the Crappy Football League could be dominated by a good college team....oh, wait....their all on suspension....."
619515,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-08 14:57:00,336,"Crazyhook,  Always known fantasy football and fishing mix well.  My family league is the WFL(Wabakimi football league).  It's fun to use our fishing names and to keep better in touch with each other.   I'm already in 4 leagues but a true fishing league, I'm in.  Just so everyone knows, I would prefer Pike lures."

619651,solopaddler,2011-09-08 22:00:00,8605, So do you.
619779,Billy Bob,2011-09-09 10:04:00,5865, I have to give credit to solopaddler for sticking up for his beloved league...  Someday you opinion my change.....the NFL doesn't have enough football and too many commercials....too many yellow flags....but last nights game was excellent...now if only our owner would pass on and a new one take over and get serious about winning we would really have something to cheer about...  Go Ralph Wilson and leave the Bills behind....
