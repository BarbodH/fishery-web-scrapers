I finally got a deep cycle battery and tested out my trolling motor. As per one of my latest threads, I've been experimenting with diving cranks so I decided that I would do the same this night and leave the worms at home.  VERY few boats out there...not like the spring at all.  Trolling motor worked wonderfully!  Most beautiful night I've seen in a long time.      First cast with a jig        A final shot before I packed it in.   4 in total, one came off at the boat, all under the slot and good eating size. I kept two and one will be given to my Grandma tonight...she loves walleye.  Cheers all."

619834,mercman,2011-09-09 13:27:00,7054,"Now thats what i`m talking about Nice fish, and incredible sunsets RC."
619836,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-09 13:29:00,2690,"Some really nice photos of the boats in the sunset Chad.  Fresh walleye, mmmmmmmmmmmmm"
619840,Harrison,2011-09-09 13:44:00,2202,Nice shots and with a couple grapplers!
619842,GBW,2011-09-09 13:49:00,8460,nice report and pic's.
619847,NAW,2011-09-09 14:06:00,4022,Great pics the Chad.  Nice little pile of rocks in the bow too eh
619853,Rod Caster,2011-09-09 14:24:00,5784, Haha that's my ballast and anchor if needed
619855,adolson,2011-09-09 14:26:00,783,"Wow, great pics!"
619860,johnnyb,2011-09-09 14:36:00,3413,Beautiful shots.....nice fish too!  I need to get up there
619869,Joeytier,2011-09-09 15:17:00,3990,Sometimes it outfishes him too...
619872,Rod Caster,2011-09-09 15:27:00,5784,  And gives me a lot less backtalk then some of my other fishing partners.  Miss you too bud
619886,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-09 16:13:00,1022,A nipissing walleye on the first cast is impressive by my books. I have to work my but off for each and every one of them. Good work!
619944,rufus,2011-09-09 21:58:00,267,"Very nice  Sportspal, right? How do you like it? I am thinking of looking for a used one..."
619957,Jer,2011-09-09 22:15:00,1426,  You want one you can sail?  
619966,Rod Caster,2011-09-09 22:34:00,5784,"Haha nice sail-pal.  I like the sportspal a lot. No worries about scratches, easy to patch, super light and takes a lot of weight. On the other hand its difficult to portage without a yolk, the seats aren't great (the foam ones) and it isn't the fastest canoe over long distances. For fishing, its one of the better choices imo."
619969,Musky or Specks,2011-09-09 22:39:00,2710,The best scenery for walleye is my kitchen. Some nice fish and some great photos.
619970,Terry,2011-09-09 22:46:00,14456,great shots

620046,Leecher,2011-09-10 02:52:00,7832,"Great job Chad on the new technique If you want to try something new, crank wise... give a Hot'N Tot a go  Hot 'N Tot  They are killer for eyes and go real deep  The one I like is the dark camo green with orange under belly  Nice fish and pics btw  Thanks for sharing! Jacques"
620067,spincast,2011-09-10 11:10:00,3279,great photos - those sunset  colours are great; and to have a few walleys for the table too.. excellent.
