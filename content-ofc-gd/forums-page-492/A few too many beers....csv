Well, a few hours later and about 7-8 tall boys, we called it a night.  Woke up this morning realizing that I can't indulge like I used too, lol. I still like to have beers, just not that many.  So in short, here is what booze made me do    Walleye, eggs, panfries, bacon, english muffin and some ice tea"
