Please give me any thoughts you may have.  My only limitation is that it must have indoor toilet facilities. Don't care about hot water, It's a long story, but I could never get my son to an out house.  Thanks in advance."

619428,Skud,2011-09-08 01:37:00,739,An indoor toilet would be a selling feature for my Wife too. I really want to get her out next year. I would appreciate a point in the right direction too.
