619118,Mattitude,2011-09-07 01:22:00,155,Haven't been around in a while but I thought I should post this.  I was at one of my shore spots in Orillia and watched some guy pull out 3 consecutive Gobies.  He wasn't sure what they were so he asked me and I looked at it right away and knew (and no it wasn't a sculpin at least from the pictures I've seen)  I have a picture on my phone that I will try to upload. I had no idea they were here until today. 
619151,Roy,2011-09-07 02:28:00,13728,Gobies have been in Simcoe since at least 2006. Couchiching probably shortly thereafter.
619159,Homer Is King,2011-09-07 02:44:00,305,"Yep, we caught a bunch fishing at McRae point this summer. It's a round goby for sure, the black dot is the give away.  The regs still state ""If you catch a round goby it should be destroyed and not released back into any waters."" (page 13) but I think it's too late for Simcoe."
619162,NAW,2011-09-07 02:52:00,4022,"Been getting quite a few in the past few years.  I hope it doesn't effect the fish as far as table fair goes..  Herd they are toxic, so i would think if the trout and whities are eating them, then they may become a little toxic too?"
619166,Sinker,2011-09-07 02:56:00,8692," I've caugt trout, whities, and perch full of gobies out of simcoe. They have been in there for a few years for sure. The bottom is covered in them along the SE shore!  S."
619171,Mattitude,2011-09-07 03:42:00,155,They were all left out of the water so they won't be swimming anymore.  Either way I didn't think they had made it here yet.  Unfortunate for the lake but something's gotta eat them hopefully.
619202,oldphart,2011-09-07 12:36:00,665,"~~~On Sunday the 4th spot we hit just south of Thorah 27', we marked a lot of action on bottom dropped lines and there were Gobbies, the size of minnows 1.5"""
619206,cityfisher,2011-09-07 12:47:00,959, The lakes are filled with them... I went snorkeling a couple weeks back on simcoe and all i could say is WOW ... Gobies everywhere !
619216,mattp33,2011-09-07 14:00:00,290,"Yep, the perch like them.  I cleaned a few on the weekend and they were full of them.  The smallmouth have all the food they could ever want in that lake now.  I was there on monday and was amazed at how clear the water was!"
619225,eman,2011-09-07 15:19:00,101,Gobies feed on eggs of other species and I wonder how they're explosion has affected the hatch #s of resident fish. Has the MNR been doing any studies? Sure the smallies and big and plump now but what happens in ten years when they die off?  
619343,Rich,2011-09-07 22:28:00,3927,I think the booming fish populations in Lake Erie far more than 10 years after the introduction of gobies proves they'll naturally become part of the species chain like everything else.
619357,misfish,2011-09-07 23:07:00,29133, Cant argue that Rich. Smallies love them.Wonder why they make Golbie baits now.LOL  Hey there Matt.  Need to make a visit up soon.My poker sence is tingling.  Good to hear from you.
619388,chris.brock,2011-09-08 00:14:00,4053," Often when there's a new species introduction, a population(s)will boom, and the cycle can be long, 10 years or more, but once the fishery has a few generations, the results could be very different, Lk Erie maybe be doing well now, but smallies, walleye and perch may be seriously hurt in the longer term from gobies  Any gobies making there way up the Trent from Lk Simcoe?"
619439,Homer Is King,2011-09-08 02:05:00,305,I'm note sure of the Simcoe end of the Trent but they are coming in from the lake Ontario side. They are up as far as Rice Lake now.
619761,Rich,2011-09-09 04:14:00,3927, Gulp Alive Gobies - amazing steelhead baits
