619684,tightline,2011-09-08 23:38:00,322,Here's a great app for you I-Phoners.  http://itunes.apple.com/app/pro-knot/id322197864?mt=8
619753,Bernie66,2011-09-09 02:58:00,123,Started using the Alberto's knot this year instead of the Albright.  Wonderful knot. No slippage what so ever and the tag ends comes out parallel to the main line and leader unlike the uni-uni.
619941,Aaron Shirley,2011-09-09 21:43:00,655,"I have been using a triple surgeon's knot to tie braid to fluoro for many years. It is a VERY easy knot to tie in any conditions, very quick and very strong. I've tied them in the passenger's seat of a boat going 50mph in Novemer without a problem, and never have these knots fail.  Another good one is the albright, and as Garry pointed out, very thin diameter that goes through the guides well and doesn't collect moss or weeds as badly. It is also a very strong knot, but it is more difficult to tie than a triple surgeon's knot in cold weather with numb fingers.  I stopped using the uni to uni knot a long time ago in favour of the triple surgeon's and albright.  Better knots IMO for the reason's I mentioned, but the uni to uni is a strong knot if you don't mind the lengthy time it takes or gathering junk on the knot or ticking going through the guides."
619336,Pickeral eater,2011-09-07 21:54:00,155,I guys just wanted to know what you would use to connect braided to flour leader. Was thinking about just using swivel to join the two but have been reading up on double uni knots.  Just wondering the strength and if this is the only way to join the two. I recently switched over to braid (going to try It out for first time next week) and don't want to lose fish to inferior knots. Thanks Bill
619338,mercman,2011-09-07 22:17:00,7054,http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html  Double uni or Albright work very well
619339,jjcanoe,2011-09-07 22:19:00,744,second vote for the Albright knot
619340,Rod Caster,2011-09-07 22:21:00,5784,Never had any issues with a double uni from 20lbs braid to 15lbs fluoro.
619345,manitoubass2,2011-09-07 22:30:00,11391,"I stick to the double uni and have never had an issue. Can be a pain in the butt trying to tie two lines in a boat on a windy day though(oh wait, I guess thats an issue)"
619347,Raf,2011-09-07 22:31:00,3495,i use the double uni on 50lb braid to 50-60 fluoro for pike fishing never an issue.
619361,Garry2Rs,2011-09-07 23:10:00,1425,"The Albright Special makes a smaller, smoother knot than the Uni-Uni. It passes through the guides better and is less prone to pick up moss etc. When you tie it, be sure to wind the braid around the Fluoro or mono. Garry2rs"
619362,aquaman456,2011-09-07 23:14:00,13,double uni for sure. never had a problem!
619381,rufus,2011-09-07 23:55:00,267,Another vote for the Albright here!
619382,manjo39,2011-09-08 00:01:00,354,  I like the double uni also.  Never had a problem even with joining two different diameters
619404,Live2fish85,2011-09-08 00:48:00,1633,I use the double uni and never had a problem.
619408,bigcreekdad,2011-09-08 00:54:00,546,"loop to loop, or surgeons knot"
619410,adempsey,2011-09-08 00:57:00,1498,
619415,GBW,2011-09-08 01:13:00,8460,uni-uni here too.  I just take 2 or 3 more wraps with the braid around the floro leader to make sure it holds and still no prob.  it's not too bad to tie in the wind if you can duck down or turn your back then.  just wet the braid a bit so it's less likely to blow around in the wind.  that works for me...
619436,Pickeral eater,2011-09-08 01:57:00,155,"Wow thanks for the quick replies guys!  Just one more question, with the albright knot, when they speak of the heavier line are they talking strength of the line or the line with the larger diameter? Thanks Bill"
619438,Pickeral eater,2011-09-08 02:02:00,155,My bad guys just read garry2rs post and answered my last question.  Braid wraps around fluorocarbon. Thank Bill
619446,mike rousseau,2011-09-08 02:35:00,4661,If your trolling use a swivel... The larger the better...  When weeds slide down your line they will be caught on the swivel and this keeps you lure running...
619454,Fishnwire,2011-09-08 02:54:00,983,Double uni here as well.  I like a swivel for some applications too.
619459,manitoubass2,2011-09-08 03:29:00,11391, Great tip! Works well  in current also   
619467,Rich Clemens,2011-09-08 09:16:00,3131,I'll vote for the Uni-to-Uni knot.  No problem there.
619469,Roy,2011-09-08 10:32:00,13728,"There are dozens of very good line to line / line to leader knots out there. Most are reasonably easy to tie. What is the best knot for me might not be the best for you. For example, the double uni is an excellent knot for joining two lines but put me out in a boat in the late fall and with the wind and numb fingers I'll never be able to tie one. Look at the link below, bookmark it under ""fishing tips"" or somesuch and when you have the time, go through them and find which one you're comfortable with. All of the knots listed are good but if you can't tie them properly in the fishing conditions you're in, they're useless. Practice your chosen knots at home 'til they become second nature. Just remember that while you're out fishing you won't always be in ideal conditions.  Here's the link: http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html"
619518,Pickeral eater,2011-09-08 15:21:00,155,"Great, thanks again guys! Bill"
619520,wkrp,2011-09-08 15:29:00,656,"Uni to uni for musky & pike, albright for anything else."
619522,woodenboater,2011-09-08 15:38:00,2277,I can be lazy on the water so I've often used two perfections to join line to leader. not tight and ideal but has worked so far and no pike or perch was lost due to lack of desire to squint while making knots although the uni or albright would be best
619652,GoneFishin,2011-09-08 22:01:00,349,"There are a couple good sites that will demonstrate how to tie, and the purpose of each knot. For joining two lines of the same size uni to uni works quite well. I find though if I'm running higher then 12-15lb leaders that a uni to uni will give at the knot. I'm practicing with new knots and the albright special seems to be a good knot and slips through the guides a lot easier then a uni to uni and can be tied with 2 lines of different diameter. Although the Six-turn Yucatan knot is supposed to be the strongest and is still smaller then the uni to uni. http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html"
