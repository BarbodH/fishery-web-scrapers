How would you bring a custom boat trailer accross the border that doesn't have a tag? and because it is older than 15 years, do I still need to worry about RIV? thanks moe"
620137,mike rousseau,2011-09-10 19:36:00,4661,I know with home made trailers... You stamp the vin # on the trailer...  Maybe with the brand match and a stamped vin you'll be alright...
