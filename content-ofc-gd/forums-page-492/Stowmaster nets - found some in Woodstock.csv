619672,scugpg,2011-09-08 22:58:00,1373,Caved in and picked one up...lifetime warranty on everything except the bag so helped made decision easier. This thing is the cat's meow just need to find some fish that can fill it!

619682,irishfield,2011-09-08 23:29:00,26272,Good deal! Great to see you got the carrying bag... keeps the boat neat! Be sure to put the bag in the sun if it gets soaked.. had a mold deal going on with mine at one time. That and the mice made a nice nest in there and ate some of my net mesh..
