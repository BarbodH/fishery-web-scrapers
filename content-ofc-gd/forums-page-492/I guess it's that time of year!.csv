619353,MJL,2011-09-07 22:47:00,2427,I'd seriously love to swing a fly right behind that camera right now.
619354,Terry,2011-09-07 22:49:00,14456,I wish I could stream my camera like that
619375,cwpowell,2011-09-07 23:48:00,265,Is this all in a tank? Or is it a river spawn?
619471,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-08 11:36:00,0,st. mary's river
619475,fishindevil,2011-09-08 11:50:00,6254,"that camera is awesome i have been tuning into that for at least 10yrs now,its amazing what you see at different times,there is also a few more of them i think the wolf river in wisconsin has one and a few out west somewhere..."

619511,hammercarp,2011-09-08 14:39:00,964,The fish with the lamprey is still on screen.
619528,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-08 16:17:00,0,st.mary's river is THE top destination for lamprey.  the sheer magnitude of the river makes it impossible to treat by traditional methods.  definitely not uncommon for every 2nd chinny to have markings some days.
619562,fishindevil,2011-09-08 17:35:00,6254,"lots of atlantic salmon and you will see pinks there as well....and yes tons,and tons of lampreys there i was going to say that as well,the biggest poulation in all the lakes aparently..."
619951,cjgraham,2011-09-09 22:09:00,104,Waded out there the other day for something to do. Chinooks are really coming up. Lookin like mini torpedos in there. Hoping for some rain to hit the park for cohos!
