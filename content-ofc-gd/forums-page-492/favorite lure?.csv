619805,Oryx,2011-09-09 12:15:00,186,"Wow, what a question.  My faves include:  #3 panther Martin,(orange blade/yellow body), Rapala XRAP Shad Rap, #3 Mepps Aglia white with Red, Cotton Cordell Big-o, and my new Fave...Sebile Koolie Minnow 72ft in Hollow Mullet.  Threw this thing out on a small lake this weekend!!!!  The action is unbelievable, and the bass were hammerin' it.  Great Slash bait"
619809,mike rousseau,2011-09-09 12:25:00,4661,Husky jerk hj-14 blue and silver Black and silver Black an gold   Anything will hot these baits... From 2lb smallies and walleye to trophy smallies and walleye... To musky... And pike go crazy over em...
619816,Harrison,2011-09-09 12:51:00,2202, Good Call.  I love fishing jerkbaits.  Fav right now is the Lucky Craft Staysee followed very closely by the yo-zuri sashimi.
619821,Thrilla,2011-09-09 12:57:00,164,j-9 rapalas in orange or silver
619823,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-09 13:12:00,2690,"Man, that is truly a tough question to answer.  Guess the best way to answer it for me is what lure can I catch the most species of fish on with varying conditions.  I'd have to say a Blue Fox Vibrax spinner (or Mepps for that matter) fire tiger finish in size 3.  I've caught Steelhead, Coho Salmon, Bass, Pike, Walleye all on that colour and size."
619871,greenfin,2011-09-09 15:26:00,7,"I fish mostly on shallow and weedy areas from canoe or kayak, so favourite lures would be SPRO and Live Target frogs and buzz bait.  Occasionally, spinner bait."
619881,manjo39,2011-09-09 15:52:00,354,"  Spring Walleye - Rapala XRAP and Flatrap, Summer Walleye 3/8 Bucktail jigs and twister tails Largemouth Bass - 6"" YUM Dinger, Strike King Rodent Panfish - 1"" pink tube jig Pike #5 Vibrax spinner Need to start Musky fishing."
619884,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-09 16:10:00,0,the doctor spoon
619888,coreyhkh,2011-09-09 16:30:00,163,XRap best lure ever made.
619906,cityfisher,2011-09-09 17:45:00,959,white spinner bait and blue and silver long a bomber!
619910,ehg,2011-09-09 18:30:00,2666,  The lure above has caught me most muskies on Pigeon Lake last 20 years. This old lure still runs perfect and outfishes the new ones i have bought.
619912,backbay,2011-09-09 18:44:00,773," Good to know, because the Storm lure I favour has been discontinued, and this is a close facsimlie."
619965,Jigger,2011-09-09 22:33:00,1237,I have a particular skitterwalk thats been cranked off rocks and was taking on water. I cant seem to find the same colour of lure anywhere. So late July i siliconed the cracks in the lure and started throwing it again and havent stopped catching fish on it. Absolutely the first and last lure im throwing if the conditions call for it.
619715,phatpelkey,2011-09-09 01:12:00,78,whats your favorite lure?  my personal favorite would be a 1/2 oz cleo in a hammered blue in silver (winter) 1/32 oz jig head with 1.5 inch tube in a green colour (spring and fall)   so whats yours?
619723,Rod Caster,2011-09-09 01:38:00,5784,"3/8 jig and 4 inch grub. It casts well, finds bottom quickly and catches just about everything.  Any color combo."
619727,aquaman456,2011-09-09 01:53:00,13,Koppers Live Target Frog for sure! Nothing better than some top water strikes. Heard they're coming out with a soft field mouse lure too...
619728,Musky or Specks,2011-09-09 01:59:00,2710,My jailbird suick certainly sees a lot of the water
619731,phatpelkey,2011-09-09 02:08:00,78,"i have a live target frog and have never used it, bought alot of bass gear and only used 1% of it lol having no boat sucks"
619732,manitoubass2,2011-09-09 02:10:00,11391, Harrison has pre-orders for them at etackle.  My fav. is a 3/8 oz. black jig with Gulp Alive emerald shiner   
619734,timmeh,2011-09-09 02:13:00,609,A black woolly bugger catches just about anything.
619736,adolson,2011-09-09 02:27:00,783,"My favorites so far are the Original Floating Rapala and the Arbogast Hula Popper. Any colors, really, but I usually use perch/firetiger. Neither are working in the past week or so (since my last report).  I am still new, but these have produced the most for me so far."
619739,scugpg,2011-09-09 02:37:00,1373,plastics would be yamamoto senkos lure would be smithwick rogue
619749,Joeytier,2011-09-09 02:53:00,3990,a 3 oz. egg sinker and massive treble hook!
619759,mercman,2011-09-09 03:42:00,7054,"  Cant go wrong with those Dana. Both were revolutionary designs when the were introduced.I have caught more fish on those 2 lures over the years, than anything else. Today, my favorites are still Rapala lures in the DT series."
619764,backbay,2011-09-09 04:17:00,773,"Tough to say just one, but a black Super Spook for top water, and a Storm Shallow Thunder 15 for jerkbaits"
619766,Rich,2011-09-09 04:28:00,3927,"Black buzzbait triple buzz, with a white trailer"
619767,bow slayer,2011-09-09 05:09:00,1074,"mepps black fury in any size I have caught everything on these ,second would be j-9 ,j-11,j-13 rapala in the black/gold finish ,again I have caught pike,musky,bass,walleye,salmon and lakers on these."
619770,walleyejigger,2011-09-09 07:52:00,876,White or chartreuse 1/4 oz jighead with a trailer hook n half a worm
619773,OhioFisherman,2011-09-09 08:08:00,6623,The one that is working best on a given day. A hard question to come up with an answer for? I like throwing a crank bait ( Storm Wee Steelie Wart ) it`s not always the best lure for the location or conditions.  Probably caught more fish on a soft plastic worm-lizard-tube-jig than anything else.
619776,davey buoy,2011-09-09 08:27:00,5505,"I love the #5 mepps gold and a 3/8 white spinner bait,when first hitting the lake."
619778,spincast,2011-09-09 09:26:00,3279,#5 meps Aglia in Salmon for the small lakes and rivers. Not quite so easy to pick one for Lake O - need a variety to find what they want on any given day
619782,Rod Caster,2011-09-09 10:29:00,5784, Its no wonder you have a hard time catching walleye
619788,Jer,2011-09-09 10:50:00,1426,If the conditions are right...nothing beats the ole Rebel Magnum Pop'R.
619793,fishindevil,2011-09-09 11:09:00,6254,"my homemade worm harnesses !!!! they catch everything walleyes,bass,muskies,trout,perch,channel cats,have even caught sturgeons on them,and just about everything else that swims,"
619797,Handlebarz,2011-09-09 11:25:00,3790,Hey Phats nice to see ya here if ya want to get out musky fishing this fall LMK I have the extra room for you any time.  As for favorite lure all around fishing would be baby minus fire tiger color I have caught everything from bass walleye pike even a splake on them.  Musky would have to be a double 10 (no bias (if that is how you spell Bias) here)
619799,lew,2011-09-09 11:34:00,12766,My #1 go-to musky bait is consistantly a big ole black/orange Grim Reaper spinner bait.  It's usually the 1st bait in the water everyday and often the last one outta the water at the end of the day.  
619801,Roy,2011-09-09 11:47:00,13728,"Hey Lew, that white spinnerbait looks like one of Mr. Cameron's creations."
619802,lew,2011-09-09 11:51:00,12766,That's the bait catcher Roy
