904180,fish_fishburn,2015-03-17 18:35:00,1311,I like to use it in my bbq burgers. 1 or 2  tbsp. per lb . The cooking process removes the heat flavour for some reason but the taste and smell is delicious. Its also good in a ceaser.
904186,OhioFisherman,2015-03-17 18:47:00,6623,"Anyone use the creamy horseradish, same texture as mayonnaise ??  My MIL used to buy it and it was far hotter than the stuff you get served at The Keg.  Darned stuff would blow the top off a steam engine. http://www.amazon.com/Woebers-Sandwich-Horseradish-Sauce-16-Ounce/dp/B000G33N3W  Good stuff, not too hot and great on roast beef or corned beef sandwiches."
902906,Big Cliff,2015-03-11 18:45:00,6899,"Ok for anyone that wants some, I have some horseradish root and tops you can have. If you have never grown it, it is like crab grass, one small piece and you will have a patch of it in no time. Now I like my horseradish, it is simple to make and you can make it as hot as you like!  Recipe is simple: Some horseradish root (I peel mine but I would imagine the commercial guys just wash it) a bit of water and a food processor to make a slury. Water root, some sugar to cut the sour, some salt to taste and when it is hot enough, vinegar to stop the enzimes.  Now the one problem I haven't been able to solve yet is that it looses heat very quickly after it is made. (if anyone knows the answer, please share.)What you couldn't eat last week is mild today.  I am thinking I might try more vinegar to preserve the heat but if you are growing it, you just make it whenever you want!  Email me: [email protected] and we'll get some to you!  "
902909,fish_fishburn,2015-03-11 18:55:00,1311,I love horseradish. The hotter the better. I have never grown it but have been thinking of giving it a try. Try adding some oil of mustard to it. Maybe that will stabilize it.

902923,Bill Shearer,2015-03-11 21:25:00,456,"OMG! Great subject! Horseradish that tries to lift the top of your head off, and makes the eyes water is the best! The Keg has had the best I've ever had. They will give you a small container of it to go, if you ask. I will have to plant some this year. Any recipe you can share would be appreciated! My favourite beef meal is a nice filet mignon. But the second is prime rib au jus, with horseradish and roasted potatoes and veg. I sure hope this thread provides an answer to the question by Big Cliff"

903039,FLEX ROD,2015-03-12 12:12:00,394,"Hi Cliff,  I have been making my own horseradish for years and my recipe is very simple, over the years I have found that vinegar is actually not what you want, it reduces the heat over time.  Instead, I peel and then soak the root in cold water for at least 2 to 3 hours, this is very important as it produces more juice in the root and actually makes the darn thing even hotter, once you grind it up after your eyes stop watering, the only thing that I add is 3 or 4 apples that I also grind up that creates the natural acidity to preserve but does not water it down.  This will hold the heat and also not change the flavour.  I just last week was in a Chef Gordon Ramsey restaurant, and had fantastic Dejon mustard with horseradish in it, it had great heat and a fantastic flavour, cant wait to try and create my own version.  The creamy horseradish that I have found to be very good is the President Choice one, for commercial store bought this stuff is great and saves you a lot of crying time by not having to grind the root yourself.

Once I got the ratio down it is amazing on sandwiches.  My wife also uses it as a rub before the prime rib goes into the oven"
903070,DanD,2015-03-12 15:36:00,2223,"To keep the ""heat"" in horseradish; try vacuum sealing the stuff. ""Foodsaver"" make containers for use with their machines. If you can keep the the air from getting at it, it will slow the fermentation process; that causes the chemicals in the root to break down and evaporate, changing its flavor/heat.  Dan."
