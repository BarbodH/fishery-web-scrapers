It was posted recently on my own forum which frankly doesn't see a lot of activity - hope you don't mind Adam but I had to share this. Every time I look at this picture I laugh.  Chris is visiting a specific outpost camp with his family in August and Adam mentioned that over the years this camp had survived a tornado and a propane tank explosion.  I countered with:    Beer fueled Brock boys > Tornado and propane explosion.  Adam offered this picture of Chris from his trip to Abamassagi Lake north of Nakina.
