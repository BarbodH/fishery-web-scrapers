904152,mike rousseau,2015-03-17 16:58:00,4661,So I was wondering...  Is gore text gore tex? Lol  What I mean is all gore tex pretty much the same?  Is there a difference in the actual material when comparing a $100 jacket and a $300 jacket...? Or are we paying triple for better zippers and pockets...  I'm in the market for a new rain suit  I love my cabelas guide-wear (got on clearance)  but unfortunately I didn't treat it as well as I should have and need a new suit... but the price is overwhelming... I don't really wanna drop $700 on a suit... But I will if it keeps me dryer....   So let's here your opinions on gore tex and your experience with suits both good and bad
904155,Bill Shearer,2015-03-17 17:09:00,456,"Goretex is the best of the breathable fabrics, IMO. There are other less expensive brands with similar characteristics, but they all have one thing in common, and that is you have to take care of them, to maintain the breathability, and repellency. If you don't it's just a waste of money. I always hang the gear, (waders or rainwear) to dry when home, and wash in the approved method with either Graingers or Nik Wax products at least once a year. Waders usually a few times to keep them clean and fresh. I wont buy anything else."
904159,AKRISONER,2015-03-17 17:29:00,5558,"I wear Cabella's home brand hunting rain suit and have absolutely 0 complaints. The jacket feels exactly like goretex and is just as breathable. Not to mention has kept me perfectly dry in the worst conditions.  theres no need to pay for the Gore-tex Branding IMO, just dont cheap out."
904162,porkpie,2015-03-17 17:48:00,2521,"I use the BPS rain bibs, had em for 8-9 years now.  Great product.  Used to use an old Browning goretex coat, but it was beat.  Bought the lightweight BPS jacket last fall.  So far so good, I'm hoping it lasts as long as the bibs have."
904163,adempsey,2015-03-17 17:55:00,1498,"Apparently, Gore-tex doesn't refer to a specific fabric but ""a specific set of performance characteristics"".  That's probably one of the reasons you see different prices.  Personally, I am just confused by it all, lol.  "
904165,lew,2015-03-17 18:03:00,12766,"You'll remember this GoreTex Mike from the last time we fished together.  Not only does it keep me dry & comfortable, it attracts nice fish too  "
904166,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-17 18:03:00,455,cabelas guide wear... hands down the winner..   I have owned them all.  that or the simms one. but the simms is much more expensive
904172,fish_fishburn,2015-03-17 18:14:00,1311,"I am wearing Arc'teryx now. I cant say enough about this outerwear. I use it all year round, its a bit spendy but absolutely flawless especially the funky waterproof zippers."
904182,mike rousseau,2015-03-17 18:40:00,4661,Was that the qualifier line up Lew...  And I'm still loving that 2 tone musky.. Such a cool fish
904201,lew,2015-03-17 19:31:00,12766,"Was that the qualifier line up Lew...  And I'm still loving that 2 tone musky.. Such a cool fish  I've had it a long time Mike and can't remember the model but it was $300 for bibs & jacket.  It's light weight and great for summer but with a fleece it's fantastic in cold weather too and I always wear it when I'm running the snowblower.  As for the 2 toner, it was definitely a cool fish indeed."
904289,David Chong,2015-03-18 01:40:00,836,"I've owned Cabela's Guide Wear, BPS 100MPH Suit and now wear a Simms Pro Dry Suit! IMO the best rainsuit out there. As a tournament angler we don't get to pick our days and I've been out there in some nasty stuff. Trust me when you're out in that stuff, it's worth every cents!"
904299,Gregoire,2015-03-18 02:26:00,1397,I heard that the patent on gore tex has expired. If you are buyibg gure tex you are just paying extra for a name.
904315,Mister G,2015-03-18 09:22:00,1429,Purchase nothing but a Cabela's name brand with either Gore Tex or Cabela's Dry Plus and here's why.  ALL CABELA'S NAME BRAND CLOTHING HAS LIFETIME WARRANTY THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.  You can't beat that warranty with a Ugly Stick
904317,singingdog,2015-03-18 10:26:00,1047,"There are lots of waterproof breathables on the market, all based on the same principle as gore-tex (pore size that allows tiny vapor particles to get through, but keeps huge water droplets out). IMHO, some of them are just as good as Gore-tex. I have been using the Patagonia shells for years and find them just as good as much pricier gore-tex based shells.  Outerware companies figured out pretty quickly that the membrane (which is different than the fabric it is attached to) was only as good as the water resistant coating on the outside of the garment; if rain/spray doesn't ""bead up"" on the outside of the garment, then the garment can't breathe. That is one of the reasons for keeping waterproof/breathables clean and conditioned. High-end companies put a lot of research into selecting the fabrics that the membrane is bonded to, often getting a fabric custom made for a specific garment. Lower priced companies have a tendency to buy ""off the shelf"" fabrics that may or may not function well as a waterproof/breathable."
904323,Yellow Fever,2015-03-18 10:55:00,139,I have a Simms suit....pricey yes but in a driving cold rain you will not regret buying something good. Bottom line is with anything related to the outdoors buy the best you can afford.
904337,BillM,2015-03-18 12:41:00,17367,Purchase nothing but a Cabela's name brand with either Gore Tex or Cabela's Dry Plus and here's why.  ALL CABELA'S NAME BRAND CLOTHING HAS LIFETIME WARRANTY THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.  You can't beat that warranty with a Ugly Stick  I got a killer dealer on some Guidewear in the fall from the US site.  Can't wait to use it this spring!   I had no idea it had a lifetime warranty.
904340,Mister G,2015-03-18 12:52:00,1429,GUIDELINES: All other Cabela's brand merchandise and National brand boots and shoes are guaranteed for one full year under normal use and against defects in materials or workmanship.  http://www.cabelas.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=ReturnsPolicy&WTz_l=Footer  Now where did I put that Ugly Stick.......
904341,BillM,2015-03-18 12:59:00,17367,Great info.  Is it bad I'm hoping for a little rain?
904345,manitoubass2,2015-03-18 13:11:00,11391,"Sounds like cabelas has a great option.  My gear is stormtech, wasnt too expensive but I got it for my bday so thats a bonus.  Its crazy to think about how far these products have come.  In my stormtech suit I can fish in a downpour for hours and your still dry as dry can be."
904355,Mister G,2015-03-18 13:28:00,1429,"Great info.  Is it bad I'm hoping for a little rain? YES, you should be praying at all times for nice and warm temps with a LOT of sun to melt the snow...but rain at night would be OK, especially if you like night fishing in the rain....LOL"
904391,Dan668,2015-03-18 15:06:00,1120,"I picked up the pro qualifier set from BPS last year, definitely the best purchase I made that year. Worked amazing in the rain. I preferred it over Guidewear/100mph as it was just a shell which allowed me to wear it in warmer temperatures, the coat atleast. And in the fall I just layered underneath with a sweater and fished until season end. And if you needed something thicker, the 100mph liner zips into the pro qualifier. Tried the Simms, nice coat but the BPS set was good enough, half the cost on sale also."
