903833,Dave Bailey,2015-03-15 21:36:00,1641,"Okay, they were just out for a fun day on the water. But at 1:25 you can sure tell he's a fisherman.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z43b13R1lHI"
903835,Bill Shearer,2015-03-15 21:41:00,456,"What a bunch of Bull! That guy and a scale have never been in the same place at any time, while fishing......"
903836,manitoubass2,2015-03-15 21:42:00,11391,"3 maybe 4 lbs hahahahah.  Ah well he was stoked, good for him."
903838,Dave Bailey,2015-03-15 21:45:00,1641,"Wasn't so long ago that a bass that size would have been a personal best for me. Not meaning to make fun of the guy, but it just seemed a bit comical."
903839,leaf4,2015-03-15 21:45:00,2466,Lol 4 pounds haha
903844,kickingfrog,2015-03-15 21:57:00,8333,"I think I hear the other guy say ""pound and a half"" near the end. He's closer but I'm not sure he'd win the showcase showdown either. Nice day fishin' with family though."
903856,BillM,2015-03-15 22:56:00,17367,"This video applies to quite a few on this board as well, lol"
903881,Beavertail,2015-03-16 00:09:00,331,Cameras add 3lbs no?
903883,Beavertail,2015-03-16 00:13:00,331,What's that saying about fisherman? How can you tell when they're lying - their lips are moving  LOL. Just don't get caught on camera doing it!
903889,Paudash,2015-03-16 00:25:00,273,"That is like the fish my dad has mounted in his basement, he swears its a 5lb and I thought so as well then I started fishing on own and caught a real 5lb  it might be a 3lb on a slow day but I could never tell him"
903892,lakerguy,2015-03-16 00:41:00,224,Bud couldn't drive that dart into him fast enough lol
903913,Nipfisher,2015-03-16 02:20:00,2449,The guy in the back actually says 4 and a half at the end. He has a smirk on his face though.
903932,OhioFisherman,2015-03-16 13:06:00,6623,"On some waters here they need to be 15 inches to be legal, not sure that one would have made it."
903953,misfish,2015-03-16 15:06:00,29133,I like the dudes shirt.
903957,Joey,2015-03-16 15:47:00,9122,I like the dudes shirt.   I had a feeling you would B
903964,SirCranksalot,2015-03-16 16:29:00,3291,Maybe we can get him a deeper net too!!
903967,mike rousseau,2015-03-16 16:35:00,4661,Lol. We all know people like that...  That in mind he may not know any better...  Hopefully he's not a member with everyone teasing him
