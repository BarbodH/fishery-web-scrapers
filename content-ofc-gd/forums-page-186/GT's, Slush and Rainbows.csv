Since neither mine or Joey's sled is a dedicated two-up, we chose to pull the third guy on a GT, a kids GT. We split task as the trail was 10kms long. Yes, that's a long ride on a GT, but it was actually quite enjoyable.      Of course we found a few nasty slush holes. Took us a couple hours to be free.        Two fish, enough to make it a successful trip."
903538,chris.brock,2015-03-14 14:03:00,4053,"10 km on a GT, that's pretty funny. Off topic, but those things were well made. I still have a larger size GT. We've had 2 guys on the BR and a third guy towed on the GT into back lakes. Towed a GT behind a boat too.  Looks like a beauty day out there (aside from the slush), short sleeves, sun and a couple nice bows. Were the fish up top, just under the ice?"
903542,Beavertail,2015-03-14 14:22:00,331,"Talk about being resourceful! That's great, looks like you guys had a good time too."

The ride back wasn't as 'fun', our arses were quite sore.  We were tight to shore off a steep drop, maybe 8fow is where they were both caught."
903550,spincast,2015-03-14 15:14:00,3279,looks like  fun day! numb bum....  brings back the days of 8 hour bike rides

904624,NAW,2015-03-19 11:26:00,4022,I think my prostate would explode after being on a GT for 10Km!!  But it sure look fun!  Your a slush magnet this winter!.. Not sure what else to say about that..
904628,solopaddler,2015-03-19 11:58:00,8605,"It took you 2 hours to get out of the slush?  Nice fish boys, you deserved them!"
904630,Rod Caster,2015-03-19 12:08:00,5784,"Ya, it was really bad and two of us didn't have waterproof boots...so it was a slow and deliberate escape. Pack a trail ahead of the machine for 30 minutes, move 15 feet and do it all over again. I'm getting tired just thinking about it."
