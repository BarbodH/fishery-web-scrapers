I was kinda pissed that it quit being as I had only used it 1 season, so one day I looked on top the motor and there was this learn button, had no idea what it was for, so I pushed it and the spot lock started working. don't know if it was the problem but I was happy it started working again and it has worked properly ever since, I'm now into the 4th season with it."
