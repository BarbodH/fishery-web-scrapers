T'aint cheap though.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/dremel-3d-idea-builder-0556769p.html#.VQyQHo7F-So  Considering that in the mid eighties a Commador dot matrix printer costed over $300, that is not a bad price.  Ten years ago I certainly didn't think that I would be able to pick something like that up for $1300."
