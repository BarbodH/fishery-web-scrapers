Tell mom to forget about traditional sleeping patterns and get in the habit of sleeping when baby sleeps or the lack of sleep can really take it's toll.   Our son will be two next month and the due date for our second was two days ago. Any time now...

905188,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-21 21:05:00,8243,"That is one good looking kid, he looks to have a bit of an attitude already. Way to go Chris Brock, keep them coming, it's nice to get a pile of fishing stuff for Fathers day. By the way we have never met but based on a few pics I've seen of you there is no need to get a DNA test for that little guy, just kidding Dad, congrats again."
905209,adempsey,2015-03-21 21:38:00,1498,"I just realized, 9.2!!  That's a big boy!"
905214,chris.brock,2015-03-21 22:03:00,4053,"It's still a little heavy for him, but we fired a few with the .22 today. He didn't seem to drink his sip of my beer but just kind of blew bubbles. He made a few sounds I didn't recognize, maybe Ojibway words I'm not familiar with?   Thanks everybody. My wife and me are super happy."
905217,manitoubass2,2015-03-21 22:18:00,11391,"Hahaha awesome Chris, I like your sense of humour.  If your wondering, in my first post I called him little fisher.  Congrats again my friend!"
905220,bigugli,2015-03-21 22:48:00,6138,"You're in for it now!!!!  The wild ride that never ends.  Be afraid of one particular phrase.  "" Oh Daaad""   It either means I want something, or I've been a baaaaad boy.  I still cringe 26 years later.  Lol."
905221,manitoubass2,2015-03-21 23:00:00,11391,"Im 35 and my dad answers the phone with ""what now""? Hahaha"
905039,chris.brock,2015-03-21 00:44:00,4053,"  I've never had one of these before. I guess my reason for posting this is because we have important training to do and I'm wondering how soon that can start.  There's a lot to learn like -how to have a sip of your beer while standing in a kayak -how to lip a pike -how to curse in Ojibway -how to fire, reload, and fire again while dropping out of a tree -how to slowly emerge from water with your eyes open and not blinking  Any input is appreciated."
905040,steelhunter,2015-03-21 00:47:00,81,Nice
905042,adempsey,2015-03-21 00:52:00,1498,Congratulations!   All he needs is a toque and he'll be a spitting image of you.
905043,Rod Caster,2015-03-21 00:52:00,5784,Ha! He looks just like you already.  Keep him away from pike until he can fight back...pike love baby meat.
905045,spincast,2015-03-21 01:02:00,3279,"congrats! There is no manual for that one, but as you will discover, that is one of the best things. You get to write the book (Really looks like Dad)"

905052,Joeytier,2015-03-21 01:16:00,3990,Is that the same face you get after a night of drunken wizardry at the camp?  Congrats!  That's quite the skill set you're passing down.  Just make sure they know it all before the age of 12 and they're set!
905057,Beavertail,2015-03-21 01:42:00,331,Hey that's awesome! Congrats.

905068,Joey,2015-03-21 02:17:00,9122,"That's awesome Chris, congrats.   I don't know how to curse in Ojibway, but my brother was an adopted Ojibway and the funniest thing I ever heard was when my son, who was about 6 or 7 at the time, said to him ""So when are you going back the forest where you came from?""   We still laugh about it to this day"
