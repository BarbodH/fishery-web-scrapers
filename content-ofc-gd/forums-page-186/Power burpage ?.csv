904058,woodenboater,2015-03-17 02:23:00,2277,Anyone else have everything flicker briefly ? tv shut off briefly. same with furnace. hearing word of occurrences across southern Ont and possibly into western Quebec.
904059,Fisherpete,2015-03-17 02:24:00,1814,Yup happened here in Whitby
904062,captpierre,2015-03-17 02:31:00,2521,Yes also in Stouffville
904063,G.mech,2015-03-17 02:32:00,830,Same in Waterford....
904064,smitty55,2015-03-17 02:33:00,928,"Happened here in Lanark too, so this is widespread for sure.  Cheers"
904065,irishfield,2015-03-17 02:33:00,26272,Why they took pennies off the market... they needed them to keep leaning them into the fuse box at Darlington !
904066,kickingfrog,2015-03-17 02:34:00,8333,"All through the gta. Even here north of Barrie. Same thing on the weekend, here and gta. No wind, no ice, just failing infrastructure."
904067,irishfield,2015-03-17 02:47:00,26272,"On Saturday at 12:30 they lost an entire phase that stretched from Orillia thru to Christian Island. I was unfortunately on that phase until 4pm and broke the rope on my generator trying to start it. It was a X member in a main tower, todays is some major switch gear failing somewhere."
904068,woodenboater,2015-03-17 02:49:00,2277,would be overkill getting a Generac for GTA use wouldn't it
904077,Sinker,2015-03-17 04:09:00,8692,Flickered here a few times too.  S.
904080,Roy,2015-03-17 04:51:00,13728,I must be too far east...didn't get it anything here.
904085,G.mech,2015-03-17 10:24:00,830,"I must be too far east...didn't get it anything here.  QC must get the cheap, reliable power that our government keeps spouting off about; the stuff we sell below cost.  We keep the expensive, unreliable, renewable stuff here in ON.  Maybe the wind stopped blowing after dark last night...."
904087,G.mech,2015-03-17 11:03:00,830,"Just saw this in the morning news:  Hydro One is investigating what caused a sudden, but short, drop in voltage on its transmission system. The event happened at about 9:30 p.m. Monday and utility spokesperson Dana Gardner confirmed social media comments that it hit such communities as Hamilton, Brampton, Toronto, Ottawa and Sudbury. ""We did see a momentary drop in voltage that people may have seen,"" she said. ""At this time, the cause is unknown and crews are out patrolling the lines and investigating what could have caused it."""
904088,dave524,2015-03-17 11:10:00,4508,"All was fine here, but then again I think we are off the grid, we had power all thru the big blackout of 10 or so years ago."
904090,misfish,2015-03-17 11:21:00,29133,Power out here last night at the plant around 9:30. Woke up at 4am to darkness. 8500 without power due to a pole on fire.  So what are your thoughts on this road salt spray vapor theory? Why now are they saying this is whats causing down lines?

There sure seems to be a lot of poles catching fire lately though!"
904097,bigugli,2015-03-17 12:14:00,6138,"  We've used salt forever now.  What has kept changing is technology. The chemical composition of the actual wire may not have changed, but the coatings sure have. Some salts have add-in compounds. Then there is that beet/grape extract they've been spraying. Surprise!!!  They only just started to figure out that it can be corrosive to certain plastic or rubber compounds."
904110,John Bacon,2015-03-17 13:38:00,3277,I have had quite a few of these pauses in the power supply lately.  Yesterday was certainly not the first one.
904113,mukluk,2015-03-17 13:54:00,196,Just ready to sink the black ball to win the snooker game at the Legion here in Claremont.  The flickering lights threw my train of concentration off and I missed.  Cost me the game.    At least that was my excuse.

But the new liquid salt solution has only been used for the last 5-ish years and for many of us this winter didn't have a mild rainy break to wash off the poles/wires this winter."

Induced pipeline currents intensify.Spacecraft - Systems may experience surface charging; increased drag on low earth orbit satellites, and tracking and orientation problems may occur.Navigation - Satellite navigation (GPS) degraded or inoperable for hours.Radio - HF (high frequency) radio propagation sporadic or blacked out.Aurora - Aurora may be seen as low as Alabama and northern California.  http://astronomynorth.com/aurora-forecast/  "
