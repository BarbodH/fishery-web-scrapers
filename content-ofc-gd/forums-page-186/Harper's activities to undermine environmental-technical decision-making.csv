What ever political party you prefer please review the list (all linked to new articles). It's long. Bill C-51 is a terrible bill.  Even the lawyers agree.

I have no problem seeing them removed.  Copied from a page I forgot to get the link for.Summary of Bill C-51The Bill is divided into five parts:    Part one enacts the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act, authorizing the disclosure throughout and within the government of Canada of information regarding activities that “undermine” Canadian security;    Part two enacts the Secure Air Travel Act, which creates listing mechanisms and prohibitions for persons who may pose a threat to air transportation or who may travel abroad to commit terrorism offenses;    Part three amends the Criminal Code in significant ways including the creation of propagation crimes criminalizing the expression of ideas related to terrorism and its propaganda;    Part four broadens the mandate of CSIS to operate both inside and outside of Canada (also in conjunction with Bill C-44) and to this end to be authorized to seek judicial authorization on a number of matters that may otherwise violate Canadian law and the Constitution; and    Part five relates to amendments to immigration security certificate legislation allowing, in part, the government to withhold information from the specially appointed, national security approved Special Advocates retained to represent a detained person in confidential and closed national security hearings.Now I can also list a bunch of items and in my case I will make sure they aren't from.. uh ...""questionable"" sources like Mike De Souze, Desmog and the Toronto Star and often even CBC..

Yeah REALLY... first your link is coming from CBC which makes it suspect anyway given that the Liberals and NDP have already promised to increase their funding but we will take it they got it right this time... .  although CBC did seem fairly fair in this one article...  ""An Angus Reid Institute poll released Thursday suggested four in five Canadians support Bill C-51, while one in three felt the new powers may not go far enough. However, 69 per cent of those surveyed wanted additional oversight to ensure law enforcement's powers aren't abused.""  So look at who is speaking out against it... Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin, Joe ""who"" Clark, John Turner  - I couldn't think of a much more useless lot.  Five former Supreme Court justices.   - Which Supreme Court... . Quebec?  seven former Liberal solicitors general and ministers of justice  etc.  FIRST.... what do they have the issue with?  What point(s)?  Second is it a reliabe comment based on facts OR is it a stupid anti fear mongering comment to low info voters like the C-42 lies...  The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Bill C-42: “The Liberal Party of Canada feels strongly that Bill C-42, currently before Parliament, contains aspects that will put Canadians’ safety at risk. “First, it eliminates the need for owners of prohibited and restricted firearms to have a transportation license to carry those guns in their vehicles. This means they could freely transport handguns or automatic weapons anywhere within their province, whether to a grocery store or a soccer field."" https://www.liberal.ca/lpc-opposes-cpc-gun-bill/   The Canadian Bar Assiciation wants it to have a 5 year run and be reviewed (which makes sense), but the comments of Cretien etc read like the political idiots at Idle and Occupy or the Harper Haters that just make supid generic comments...essentially hate of what ever comes up.   The Liberals support it, 80% of the population support it, in general I support it but do agree that the additional oversight looks good  But big sweeping rantings like the NDP, Idle and Occupy are nothing more than obvious politicing to me!!   No contribution, no focused criticism... just Henny Penny screaming.  So other than being a talking head parroting some of the worst Prime Ministers in Canadian history, WHY?     Since we're talking about politics and gov'ts, Here's an interesting article about the founding father of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, who recently passed away at the age of 91.

Lee Kuan Yew was a strong leader that built a peaceful and prosperous nation, he was an interesting and inspirational leader....  it would be fun to see the reaction in Parliament and the media to caning being added to the penalties for some of the youth crimes.,I do believe it would make a difference to some bring home a real impact of their actions and being accountable, that few seconds of pain and the embarrasment of a public punishment, I wonder ... 10%, 30%...?

It reminds me of the fear mongering and whining when Air Canada and CN were privatized.  Odds are there will be stock options, good benefits and projects dictated by demand and contracts rather than some political whim and you will be much less likely to be shut down as a cost saving political decision but if whining makes you feel better, go right ahead just base it on something real.    In the mean time talk to HR, take any classes you can and make yourself more attractive to a new employer instead of taking the attitude you seem to have, at one company I even helped the HR person organize classes and even tought a couple, been there, done that several times, initiative, attitude and planning will help you out.   Think, try, do.... are better than   Whine, give up and fail...   Good luck   P.S.  One of the companies during the buyout sent the 50% of us reduced to a course on how to search for jobs and one of their tools was a personality test to look at what you were good at, your attitude etc.  I looked around and found one that looks similar you can try.

We realize you are very busy, with saving the world from political misinformation, global warming and such, but if you could make some time for us lazy peasants we'd be in your debt.  First, and this is a biggie, can we please kiss your ring?  Next, as you are so knowledgeable of the ""sale"" and overall situation, could you offer your vast knowledge to the government and to the management of the crown corporation and make sure they are doing the ""sale"" according to Canadian law?  We know that management has made some poor decisions in the past, and the government hasn't been truthful (Egad!  I'm sorry for this, I hope I haven't raised the ire of your holiness!), but with YOU there, we know this would be done properly!  We will sing a song at our next union meeting in your honour!  I hope we can remember all those words though...  All hail to the Mosquito!  Now...if I could offer some advice to the Mosquito.  One of the things I've learnt is that the world isn't black and white, there is some grey in there too.  The arrogance and tone of your posts would indicate you are a close-minded person, I hope this isn't the case - I used to think this way, but life showed me otherwise.

As for my ire... heck no, I have worked with iritating, arrogant and insulting people many times, I usually feel sorry for them because their attitude limits them and alienates those around them.  Your attitude of entitlement and pride won't help you keep or find another position if needed.  Yeah... union, that fits with your unwillingness to learn and response to working with HR, and your display of ""knowledge"" about pension contributions.  Well if you with to learn from my knowledge and experience here is one item.... Unions look out for Union management FIRST, their members a distant second and if it means protecting their positions and power they have no problem screwing over members so relying on them is like using a balsa wood walking stick, looks good until you need it.  Rely on yourself first, going to the union is an unreliable tool of last resort.  If you want to sing, sing about taking responsibility, learning and looking for a Plan 'B' instead of a wow is me dirge of doom and self pity.  I have worked at big companies and small, often at the small you are manager, sales, support and at the end of the day janitor taking out the trash, so suck it up and quit sounding like a spoiled pampered child.  Talk to workers, friends, family, take the personality test to see what you would be good at and If your only goal is to go fishing then why not work on your personality for around customers and find a resort or guide you can work with during your vacation as part of plan B (you will probably have to volunteer this year).

Harper can only change things so fast and with so much of the Media like CBC nothing more than a Liberal advertiser (it really showed when Wynne thanked CBC for all the hard work right after the election) to push through austerity would be political suicide.  Harper has to be strong to control a mixed group like the Conservative pary where you have Libertarians,, Conservatives etc. etc.   Anyone can lead Justin and Mulcairs sheep parties and even at that he won't allow anyone not approved and kicks out those 2 without evidence... playing the dictator.  Yes you can kiss that income splitting money good bye as well as increases in credits probably and the TFSA that the Conservatives put in the left won't talk about what they plan although they sure yelled when the max was increased, GST cuts won't say etc. etc..  The Liberals really actually seem to hate families, two people working making 80,000 make alot less than an 1 income family whether it is kids, aging parents, disability or other reason and some of the comments on CBC were quite arrogant and insulting too.  There is also the impact on business with Carbon taxes and policies that as Butts says will change how people behave.  Look at what the electricity rates have done to jobs in Ontario, factories leaving like crazy and even the stables are moving out....  Why a Leamington greenhouse is investing $200M in Ohio http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/why-a-leamington-greenhouse-is-investing-200m-in-ohio-1.2917918 “It is definitely a loss and a significant loss to Leamington, Ontario and Canada.”  There is the impact of the unemployment, the debt and society....  just think about what an NDP/Liberal coalition would do, you can look at Wynne and Horwath for that...   auditor general warnings ($15B this year alone and est $320B by 2018), debt downgraded, OPP investigations, RCMP investigating OPP, Ontario needing transfer payments for the first time,  .....   It isn't that Liberals are unintelligent, it is that they don't want to face the reality of fincances and responsbility, I can give lots of personal examples from that like my one cousin, he kept posting some stupid posts put and the last time he had one saying Harper would bet $500K a year in pension,  I asked him if he actually believed it and sent him a link to the Globe and Mail showing that the conservatives had actually reduced the pension and increased the required payments... he unfriended and blocked me on Facebook.

It's more about the people in the government and the decisions they make, than the brand itself.  If there was a decent and true Conservative option, I'd support them. Harpers government is joke and isn't conservative or even Canadian (in my opinion not Canadian, that is subjective) at all, expect for a few showpiece bills that are nothing more than smoke and mirrors, self-propelling drivel. Hugh Segal should have started up a party of his own... a competing right-wing party is what is needed to keep this side in check."

Liberal party is in many ways more conservative than the Federal Conservative Party true, including their willingness and efforts to balance the budget, resource use etc. but if you look the choices federally are Centrist, Far left and FAR left.  Ontario and Quebec Liberal parties and the NDP correspond with their federal name sakes.  Within weeks of the last Ontario election the CIO at one of our customers set about a relocation to BC.   BC has shown a tendancy more recently to move left again especially with the LNG and pipelines though, so we shall see.  Quebec has needed transfer payments as long as I can remeber and under McGuinty and Wynne Ontario has needed transfer payments and the debt has gone up, economy down, jobs down.  It was telling a few months ago I saw the unemployment in Canada went down 10,000.... Ontario went down 25,000 fulltime jobs.  Think about those numbers and what it means for the rest of Canada."

OK....   have you ready even an analysis or summary of C-51?   The Liberals have come out against several pipelines actually.  If you actually look it is the Liberals and NDP doing most of the fear mongering and out right lying (ex. look at the link to their views on C-42).  Let me get this right....  So the Conservatives have: 1) cut taxes and saved Canadian tax payers billions 2)  added ways to save without being taxed (TFSA) 3) made cheifs and reserves actually accountable for the millions they receive each year (total over $5 billion) 4) added legislation to clear up citizens arrests so bull sh** like the owner of the Lucky Moose in Toronto don't happen 5) added mandatory sentences to many of the serious crimes. 6) increased what they have to pay into their own pension and moved the retirement date from 55 to 65 (costing Harper an est. $1,000,000 personally) etc.  and you want to vote for a party that: 1) wants to roll back the tax cuts taking billions out of Canadian working peoples pocklets 2) wants to roll back the accountability act allowing more hidden spending while reserves turn into ghetoes. 3) wants to roll back mandatory sentences so criminals can get out earlier. 4) wants to a add carbon taxes 5) lies about open nomination, C-42 and more 6) is run by a trust fund rich kid that was taking money from Charities and School boards for speaking fees while an MP (getting a full pay there). etc. (see above for alot more)  In the delusion that in 4 or 8 years there won't be much change...  yeah, just look what the Liberals did in Ontario in the 4 years, smart meters, Ontario Pension Plan, electricity increase..... turned Ontario into a have not province with high unemployment and businesses and manufacturing leaving.  Just to remind you it took the Liberals in Ontario less than 6 months to add new income taxes, add the Ontario Pension Plan (think personal and corporate deduction ... ie more reason to leave or reduce staff), pushed through the new school ciriculum that even McGunity withdrew over protests, almost tripled the aviation fuel tax (flying anywhere...), is talking about more electricity increases (even though Ontario pays more than any state or province in North America by far), more contracts for windmills (Ontario already has a large surplus and is selling to the States and Provinces at 1/2 the price it is buying it from the wind genereators, payed off the one teachers Union with hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars...... and I could go on but I don't want to bore you.  Oh but in 8 years they doubled Ontario's debt, thousands of jobs left Ontario, increased Ontario provincial workers by 100,000 and wasted billions on gas plants, eHealth, Orng etc....  or they Federal Liberals have mentioned the Australian model for firearms so you can just think in less than 2 months all semi-auto and many pump firearms were seized and scrapped... so empirically your statement is incorrect about what they can do... they can do what ever they want.

Smith, who splits his time between Canada and Yorkshire, was recently asked by the U.K. Labour Party to be a spokesman for its campaign in advance of the May 7 election.

When that's done, Smith told The Tyee, he will be returning to Canada to do the same, in a ''full-tilt'' effort on his part to help oust Prime Minister Stephen Harper. ''He is really, to me, the worst prime minister that ever existed,'' Smith said over the phone from Manchester, pausing for a drink of water. ''Since Harper has come into power, everything has gone downhill. He has one consideration, and that is to let the rich get richer and the poor fend for themselves.'' Smith said the ''epidemic'' of child poverty in Toronto, government service cutbacks, and tax loopholes used by corporations are some of the most concerning threats facing the country today. It's a stark difference from when he first arrived in Ontario in the 1950s to start anew after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. ''I've seen this province and the rest of the western world slip back to a society that reminds me of my boyhood,'' Smith said. ''Today is starting to have that same edge -- the same cruelty, the same divisions between those that have, and those that have not, that polarized the 1920s.'' A 'miracle' middle class story Born in 1923 and raised in crippling Depression-era poverty in England, Smith and his wife moved to Canada in 1953, eventually settling in Belleville, Ont. where he opened a carpet business. At the time, Smith saw Canada as a virtuous country, where buildings weren't hundreds of years old and he could raise his family. He knew he could put food on the table, own a home, and perhaps have grass in the back garden. It was a far cry from the slums of his youth in England, where his 10-year-old sister was buried in an unmarked ''pauper's pit'' after dying of tuberculosis -- a story he retold in front of thousands during a speech to the Labour Party conference last year. But there was no longer such torment for Smith, as the Canada of the 1950s delivered on its promise of prosperity. ''It was almost a miracle to me that I came from nothing to be a respectable middle class man,'' Smith said. ''It was not just me, it was everyone around us.'' Back then, none of his friends or neighbours had a problem with paying taxes. Most of them, having grown up in the Depression, thought services paid for by taxes were what made the country a safe and good place to live. But the decades of prosperity for those like Smith have slowly slipped from view, as corporations and politicians robbed the public of its social safety net, he said. It's a trend that began with Margaret Thatcher in the U.K., he added. ''[The public] has suffered so much under different governments that they now feel that they can't trust anyone anymore, that no one is going to come along and rescue them,'' he said. That's led to a desperate situation where poor people are overwhelmed by the affects of austerity and don't know how to make ends meet, he said. Voting for 'compassion' Smith said he will tour the country in the run-up to the Canadian election, delivering speeches aimed at youth about the perils of austerity and attacks on government services. He said young people in Canada need to realize their futures are at risk if they don't oust Harper and vote in someone with ''compassion'' who cares about them. His upcoming speech at the Broadbent Institute's Progress Summit, starting Thursday in Ottawa, will touch on some of these themes. Smith was originally to appear in person to deliver a speech at the progressive conference, but the request for him to support the Labour Party pulled him back to England, and he will now speak via video. The touring will begin once Smith returns to Canada, and he said he's ''looking forward to seeing the back of that monster,'' Harper. He stressed that warning young Canadians about their inaction risks the return to an uncivilized, brutish reality -- one festering with poverty and indifference to those drowning in it. For Smith, that reality is long ago, but not forgotten. ''We were a generation of people who received nothing and we had to fend for ourselves to improve our standard of living,"" he said. ""But it was much easier for us than it is for the young people of today.”"

""A sparkling-clean nation where everyone willingly paid their taxes is the Canada that Harry Leslie Smith remembers choosing as a place to raise his family and live his life decades ago.

904917,John Bacon,2015-03-20 17:01:00,3277,"http://www.whynotharper.ca/#printablelist  Why Harper will never get my vote. Is anyone truly ok with this?  You could come up with a list of reasons not to vote for anyone.  Here are some responses to these claims.  1. Contempt for Canada: This one is a joke.  It was MPs from the Liberal and NDP parties that found him guilty.   His opponents make it sound like he was found guilty in an unbiased court of law.  2. Cheated in the 2006 Election: Other parties have been found guilty of election issues as well.  Liberal senator Raymond Lavigne has already served jail time for fraud.  3. Turned Canada's Surplus into Debt: Trudeau ran several consecutive deficits which when measured as a percent of GDP were more than twice as bad as Harper's worse deficit.  Trudeau increased Canada's debt more than 10 fold from $18 billion to well over $200 billion.  When the Chretien led Liberals started running surpluses in 90's they did so by cutting transfer payments to the provinces by 34% in one year and taking money from the E.I. surplus.  They also ran their surpluses during a world wide economic boom.  Harper has restored funding for health care and continues to increase health care transfer payments by 6% a year; well in excess of inflation.  He also ran his deficits during a world wide recession; we would have had deficits regardless of who was in power.  He had surplus budgets prior to the recession.  4. Wants US-style bank deregulation: He as had a majority government for almost four years and has not proposed any legislation to de-regulate banks.  5. Opposes universal health care: Health care in Canada has always been administered by the provinces.  Provinces do receive transfer payments from the federal government to help fund health care.  As mention above; these transfer payments were cut by 34% by Chretien; Harper has since restored the transfer payments and is committed to continued increases of a minimum of 6% a year until 2017.  Afterward they will increase by a minimum of 3% a year depending on inflation and growth in GDP.  6. Harper shut down Parliament Twice: Chretien and Trudeau did it too.  The Liberals, NDP, and Bloc could have formed a coalition after the parliament restarted.  However, polls at the time indicated that Harper would have received more than 50% of the popular vote if an election was held then.  The Ignatief decided it was not a good idea.  7. Wants to replace the stable CPP with the untested PRPP: I have not heard of any legislation proposed to this.  He has a majority so he could have done this if he wanted to.  8. Shut down Women's and Minority advocacy groups:  How much funding do men's advocacy groups get?  10. Fraud: Liberals and NDP have been found guilty of offences too.  As mentioned above,  Liberal senator Raymond Lavigne has already served jail time for fraud.  Liberal senator Harb claim a residence that was deem to uninhabital as his primary residence.  He later sold the property but continued to claim it as his primary residence for several years after the sale.  12. Wasteful G20 spending, and a record number of arrests:  It was the provincial and city police that made the arrests.  15. The Harper Conservatives want to buy 65 stealth fighter jets using $29 billion of tax payers' money:  The plan to purchase F35s was initiated by the Liberals.  The program was inherited by Harper.  19. Sabotaging efforts to deal with climate change: Carbon emissions have actually decreased by 5% under Harper; they had increased under the Liberals.  I do admit the Harper has not done much to prevent climate change; but neither did the Liberals."
