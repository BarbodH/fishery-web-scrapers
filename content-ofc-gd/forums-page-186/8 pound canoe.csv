I will say though that seeing people switch sides every stroke drives me crazy ! Learn proper strokes and pick a side. Every paddler should know j's, pries and draws. ok, I feel better..."

Seems strange to go through all the trouble of building your own craft but don't know how to properly paddle it!"
