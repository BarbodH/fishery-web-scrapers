904558,Paudash,2015-03-19 00:23:00,273,I was looking at buying a plastics making kit but at a price of $200.00 to get started it seems like a lot of money.  Has anyone tried it?
904565,landry,2015-03-19 00:45:00,1005,I wanted to but good plastic is hard to get and it is VERY toxic. I bailed on the idea in the end.

904649,Garnet,2015-03-19 14:01:00,2056,I have 5-6 gravity molds I made. And with the help of a tooling buddy 15 injection molds. Most are 3 cavity all made of plaster Paris.  You can re melt old plastic. Stay away from smelly ones like power bait. Get a micro wave from yards but buy good micro wave measuring cups. The cheapys explode. A good pair of welders gloves. No water near plastic and no water base scents. Only oil.  You might save a few pennys on your baits but hardly worth it.  I make my own designs so it's fun.
