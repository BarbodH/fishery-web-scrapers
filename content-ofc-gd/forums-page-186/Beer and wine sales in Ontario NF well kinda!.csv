You can feel sorry for small breweries all you like but the fact is most people buy the popular beer and stick with it, small business are pretty much death in today's market. What needs to be done is more marketing towards beer as not just a summer beverage to get drunk on but as a very wide range of favours and styles. Wine is thought of as a great drink paired with certain foods but beer actually pairs better with food than wine does. Drinking from the proper style glasses that match the kind of beer would eliminate much of the ""beer isn't classy like wine"" kind of mentality."

When they 1st allowed it alot of folks figured it'd be a target for thieves but as far as I know it's never happened yet.  And for something really dumb, there's a little tourist shop in town that has a display of wine produced by an independent maker over in Buckhorn. We were in there 2 years ago and my wife decided to buy a bottle but the owner said ""sorry, but that's only coloured water in the bottles for display purposes only""  We had to decide what we wanted, then the store owner called the maker 10 miles away who then jumped in his car and delivered it to us.

I am always for more choice, but I can't for a moment believe it will benefit the micro breweries that much...  I say this because of smashing my head against the wall for a few years trying to get a grocery product listed into any major supermarket chain. The product was LIKED, by all the executives we sampled, met all the criterion for labeling. It had double the required product liability insurance, was produced under licence by a manufacturer that was already selling products in all the major chains so the distribution and supply chains were in place. Most importantly it had the financial backing of a multi millionaire, yet in the end it couldn't be listed by any of the chains. The reasoning was it might upset, the big boys who pay thousands a week in kickbacks for end displays and advertising buys....  So with space already limited now for products adding booze will just mean a few marginal products will get delisted to make room, and I honestly can't see a small brewery/winery being able to do any better at getting their foot in the door full scale while competing against the giants. Hopefully some local stores will use their limited UPC codes to list some local favorites though."

I find it funny that they wont sell distilled spirits outside of LCBO alongside wine and beer because of ""social responsibility"" ....  so why when  I'm up in West Guilford and walk into the the grocery store up there to buy a steak I could pick up a up a bottle of rum if I want to ...I guess the ""social responsibility"" only applies if you are south of Hwy 7 ?   ...LOL"
903347,fish_fishburn,2015-03-13 18:47:00,1311,They should do away with both the Beer Store and the LCBO. The service is good at both but their hours of operation suck in my town. Now hopefully the price of beer will come down. A 24 in quebec is15 bucks cheaper than Ontario. That's right across the river from me so that's where I buy. Plus quebec has good sales on all the time because of free enterprise. No such thing in Ontario because we have to pay stock boys and ladies 20.00 plus benefits per hour.
903348,bigugli,2015-03-13 18:55:00,6138,"Brewer's Retail is a dinosaur from an age when there were 3 family breweries in Ontario controlling 99% of the beer flow. All Canadian, Molson's, Labatt's and Carling were the owners and operators. Only member breweries and their subsidiaries were allowed to sell through Brewers Retail. The big change came with the introduction of Miller Light, and since then the restrictions have slowly devolved. Stubbies were removed. Specialty and micro brews, foreign labels and foreign ownership have all made the original reasons for the Brewer's Retail obsolete"

At least now we can wander around the store browsing for different products that we may like to try."
903358,fish_fishburn,2015-03-13 19:33:00,1311,I remember those days Lew. Kind of made you feel like you were buying contraband.lol
903360,Canuck2fan,2015-03-13 19:34:00,1444,"What should really happen is the beer and wine should be sold in grocery/corner stores.  The LCBO should be spirits and weed, where they will have a bit more control on who they sell to."

Kind of made you feel like you were buying contraband.lol   Consumer's Distributing , remember those catalogs   , operated on the same model, Funny as a university student I drank a cheap Hungarian wine,  ""1146B""  , funny, I can remember that but half the time I walk into a room I forget what I was after"

903379,Gerritt,2015-03-13 20:24:00,6129,Listening to the CBC the other day and Ontario is considering allowing wine and small craft brewers to operate their own stores... And cross sell. Craft brews at wine stores and wine at craft beer stores...  It's not much.... But it's a start  Good news for ontario for once  G
903386,Big Cliff,2015-03-13 20:44:00,6899,"What I want to know is why I can buy a bottle of Crown Royal in the US for $12.00 that cost me $52.00 here in Canada? Why can I buy a 24 of beer in the US for $18.00 that cost me $59.00 here in Canada? Don't you dare tell me it is because of the wonderful health care system we have here in Canada, we already pay a health care tax! Like I said, if Whinnie the Poo is involved you can be sure she is getting something out of it for her and she doesn't care what it costs you and I!"
