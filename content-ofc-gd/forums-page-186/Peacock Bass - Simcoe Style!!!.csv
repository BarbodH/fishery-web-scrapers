903936,NAW,2015-03-16 13:38:00,4022,"The coming weeks are by far my favourite time to fish Simcoe.  The few weeks between when White fish closes, and Ice out.  We try to get out a few times for fat Simcoe Yeller Bellies! The weather is amazing; the lake is nearly empty and quiet! And the fishing is usually very good.!  I went out this weekend, in hopes to land a white fish. But we skunked out. So he hit 12.5 FOW, and nailed a few piggies to start off the spring season.    To anyone else who enjoys this time of year... Good Luck, and play safe!!!  More pig pics to come!!!"
903948,misfish,2015-03-16 14:31:00,29133,"Nice  That's what I,ll be doing next weekend. And putting out a dead stick for a pike."
903959,Joey,2015-03-16 15:55:00,9122,"Wow Nick, those are monsters.   Well done"
903971,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-16 16:44:00,937,Holy!!  How big are those?  I've never seen perch that big.
903974,mike rousseau,2015-03-16 16:56:00,4661,Redonkulous....  You know they're huge when you can hold em by their gill plate...
903977,Acountdeleted,2015-03-16 17:35:00,2562,Oh man. Couple of beauties right there. Looks like another great day.
903986,rob v,2015-03-16 18:05:00,535,Those are beauties !!   the unfortunate part of that (and I've done the same thing) is when we keep these - we're removing the best breeding stock of the lake.   selective harvest for smaller fish !!
904001,irishfield,2015-03-16 19:07:00,26272,"Nah.. they're well past breeding prime Rob. Those things are so old all they do is sit on the internet, drink beer and eat potato chips!"
904015,Terry,2015-03-16 20:26:00,14456,"yup nice ones for sure, I was out after work today could only find babies"
904017,davey buoy,2015-03-16 20:36:00,5505,"Nice Nick,Sat can't come fast enough!!!"
904018,Joeytier,2015-03-16 20:42:00,3990,"Awesome Nick.  We hit the perch grounds yesterday on Nip and wailed the jumbos too, nothing gargantuan like those though"
904038,TJC1973,2015-03-16 23:21:00,17,Beauty perch. Looks like dinner for two.
904043,David Chong,2015-03-17 00:34:00,836,A couple of beautiful Simcoe perch! Good job!
904050,Basschaser77,2015-03-17 01:32:00,32,Wow! Biggest perch I've ever seen. They are huge. Nice catch.
904051,manitoubass2,2015-03-17 01:36:00,11391,Wow those are hogs!!!!
904078,Sinker,2015-03-17 04:12:00,8692,I love me some last ice perch too. A couple beauties you have there!!  S.
904117,NAW,2015-03-17 14:06:00,4022,"Thanks everyone!  Those perch are pigs. But they where both right around the 13"" mark.  My fishing partner has hammered some absolute tanks this year. They make the ones in my picture look small.  Here's to hoping that I can get a few of those in the next few weeks. I'll post some pics for sure if I do."
904149,aznphil,2015-03-17 16:41:00,73,are they on top of sand flat humps with scattered weeds?
904151,NAW,2015-03-17 16:48:00,4022,Yes?
